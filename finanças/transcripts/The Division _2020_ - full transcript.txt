THE DIVISION RIO DE JANEIRO, 1997 11 KIDNAPPINGS HAPPEN EVERY MONTH THE POPULATION IS TERRORIZED THE GOVERNMENT AND THE POLICE ARE AT A LOSS INSPIRED BY TRUE EVENTS You call it a trend, right ? An epidemic. But I'll tell you: kidnapping is a business, and, when a business takes off, it thrives. One gang becomes two, three. And there comes competition to fight for the market. It's called capitalism. We need to understand the nature of this crime. Kidnapping and extortion: Article 159. That's the crime that upsets society so much because the victim is not the local baker or butcher. The guys are taking big shots from advertising agencies, the banker's son and TV celebrities. It's closing in on them. You might ask, 'What about the police ? You guys seem to hang around all day long, sweeping the dirt under the rug.' The police alone can't handle public safety. It's never been like that. The police are not the solution. They're part of the problem. So, what can we do to change it all ? Things will only begin to change when our D.E.A. stops traffiking, when Theft and Robbery stops stealing, when the Homicide Division stops killing, and when the Anti- Kidnapping Division stops kidnapping. The police is meant to be corrupt and violent. So they're violent and corrupt. If they're meant to be that way, what's wrong ? They're not just restraining the population and safeguarding the elite. - Hi. - Hi. - Have you seen my guy ? - No. The tide is turning our way. When the Police goes into the slums shooting like crazy and killing "suspects", no one gives a damn. Then the end justifies the means... Son of a bitch ! You're gonna die, son of a bitch ! You're gonna die, son of a bitch ! What's your name ? Tell me. Tell me, you son of a bitch. Tell me. Tell me your fucking name ! The Devil. The Devil. Someone was being held here. You should see what we found outside, sir. Well, well, here is the Future Mr. President ! Slow down, Tavinho. One palace at a time ! First, the State, later, we'll see... Nice to meet you. It's an honor to be here, and to be part of your family. You're always welcome, my friend. - Thank you. - Hang on. It must be my rebellious daughter. Is she old enough to vote ? - Hello. Camila ? - William, right ? We gotta hunt for voters. When are these people gonna leave my house ? I don't know, Raquel. Ask your husband. He's the candidate. General. DRUG ENFORCEMENT DIVISION The old guys must be the wardens. And where's the fucking victim ? It's a Glock. Bosco. Go, go, go ! Go ! Can't you fucking help me here ? Help me ! Here we go. Come on. Come on. Get out of the way, out of the way ! - Get out of the way ! - Let's go ! Let's go, let's go ! Come on ! Open the fucking trunk ! It's a lot of dough. Look... Listen, Joe, how much do you have there ? About 200, 300 thousand ? How much for the package deal ? Trafficking and conspiracy. That amounts to how long ? 5 and 7, 12. Come on, All Star. Can't you fucking help me ? Calm down ! Eat a saltine, and I'll explain how it works. You'll leave the suitcase inside the car. That's a goner. But you wanna take the babe with you. Right, bro ? Don't you ? - He doesn't want to talk. - Kill him. Hang on, hang on, hang on ! - Let's chat a little bit. - Who's your lawyer ? Who works for you. Ms. Veronika, right ? She's hot. Have you fucked her ? Talk to your lawyer, and we'll let the girl go. Come on, girl. Joe ! Their car is at the beach. It's very far. You'll figure it out, right, princess ? Right ? Beat it ! Like so, right ? Is that right ? You like it ? Excuse me. Visiting hours are over. It was a cover- up. They killed the wardens, but it wasn't planned. - Yet the kid survived. - Miraculously, right, Benício ? Two shots. Could've been buried alive. You guys were there. Right place, right time. You could've left someone to talk. It'd make our job easier. I did your job. Anti- kidnapping's job isn't to shoot suspects. You know that. There is a life depending upon us. If we make a mistake... He was under a bunch of corpses, his stomach pierced by bullets, and you guys didn't even know about the kidnapping. The family can afford a private hospital. But moving him now is too risky. We'll send an update. Do you need anything else ? Thank you, doctor. Is that her most recent photo ? Do you appreciate how serious it all is ? It wasn't that serious before, right, Mr. Secretary ? We have to change the Anti- Kidnapping Division. The guys there can't handle the girl's case. Yeah. It was Benício's turn, but I agree that he's not ready. - We need someone different. - Who could be the replacement ? Mendonça could. The 'Genocidal' ? The kid's at the drug department doing the Anti- Kidnapping's job. I want him at the Division. Have you seen the paper ? He's holding the kid in his arms. That's what we need. A hero. - Nice photo. - Don't you start, Gaspar. Done deal. Find someone to work with him. Someone you trust. The boy Francisco de Godói Lima is still in hospital, seriously injured. - John Paul II... - The spanish... Kidnapping is a crime that may affect good families, Nina, like your own. Parents and children suffer in the hands of criminals. It's just too painful. For everyone. Police's honor is affected. That's why we're working non- stop: we have this higher goal of saving lives. I have a request for the audience: if you have any information about my brother's whereabouts, please inform the Kidnapping Division, the authorities. Serginho da Madalena. A big fish. You owe me more money. I mean, you owe society. - What are you talking about ? - Criminals call it kidnapping. They're right, in a way. But here, at the police, it's known as a 'Mineiro Scheme'. I'll give you an example. Take a drug dealer. Not any dealer. A big shot. You drag him out of a five- star hotel, where he was having fun with three girls, you drive him around town, you have the nerve to buy him hamburgers at the mall. Then you wait for the lawyer, switch the guy for the dough, share it with your mates and buy your girl a gift. - I get it. - Hang on. I have another great story. Gringo's wife arrives at Galeão under a fake name. It's showtime. You're not afraid of the feds. You talk her into delivering an address. Of course she's already part of the deal. Isn't she ? Of course she is. How much for this one ? 500 grand ? Do you wanna hear another one ? Switchblade, Fatso, Clebão da Dutra... Let's add it up. How much did you get to leave those guys out of jail ? Two million ? Three ? If you're not taking me to Internal Affairs, please cut to the chase. You're going to the Anti- Kidnapping Division. - You wanna fuck me ? - I have high hopes for you. You managed to get your hands on Serginho, Switchblade and Gringo ! Except I want you to work for the police. Actually... for Mendonça. The General's cub. Our hero. Malta is pinning his hopes on Genocidal, and I'm pinning mine on you... 'Mineiro'. Don't look at me like that. Don't you like money ? Now you're going after bankers, heirs, businessmen... Congressman Venâncio Couto's daughter. She's more valuable than Serginho. A lot more. So, what do you think ? Do we have a choice ? We get the job done, and get our visas to leave. Is it about that Congressman's daughter, Camila ? We rescue her, and then Gaspar will let us go. Must I get home reeking of this shit ? Say you busted a drug den. What if we turn Gaspar's offer down ? He will fuck us. Gaspar fucked you over. Fernanda, please tell or to get ready for us. The kid was doing well. Then, suddenly, he just dies. - Do you think that guy did it ? - I don't know. Let's go home. - Hello. - Is that Chief Mendonça ? - Speaking. - I'm from Barroso Filho Hospital. We'd like to inform you the kid, Francisco, has died. - Just now ? - An hour ago. - He didn't make it. - OK. Thank you for telling me. - Does his family know ? - Yes, we've already told them. All right. Thank you. Are you still thinking about the kid ? - Do you want me to look into it ? - No, thanks. - Bye. - Bye, dad. - Behave yourself. - Bye, honey. Have a good one. Cool. If it were up to me, you guys wouldn't be at the Division. You three would be in jail. But I'm under orders, and I follow my orders. Shit ! Anything else, sir ? The Congressman is here with his wife. - Santiago. - Mr. Benício. - The Division's man... - Mendonça is that man now. - Is this about Camila's case ? - You're well informed. Her family's here. I'm waiting for an update. Do you think I can tag along ? I might learn something. It's your case, Benício. I'll open there in half an hour. Hey, Mendonça, how did it go with the new guy ? Here you are. That Drug Enforcement enquiry you asked for. It's that boy's case. Francisco's. 'Keep your enemies close'. I have something to take care of. I'll be quick. See you at the guidance room. Roberta... Your reputation precedes you. Both the official and the unofficial. OK, sir, I'm listening. For now I just need some help. - In exchange for what ? - Calm down ! You've just arrived here. - You asked me to come. - You came, you wanna talk. That's good. But, for the time being, I just want you to run a check on this guy here. I'm not in the mood for paperwork. I know you guys have your own ways. What's this about ? Are you testing me ? I'm going to the guidance room. Can I count on you ? What about your daughter ? Benício alone gains from this. He and his security company. Hang on ! I'd asked for a loan. Clients swarm because of his fame, he picks the best cases, gives interviews, his face's everywhere. So, what's the deal ? Will you let your girl die, daddy ? - Will you ? - I'm selling the condo. That won't do. Hello. He'll pay ransom 'cause it'll pay off. If it works, he's a hero. If it doesn't, bad guy's fault. We're making progress, Congressman. When we're sure Camila's fine, we'll proceed with the payment and bring her home. Here. Phone records. The thugs called from these numbers. They didn't even bother to investigate, Joe. Different public phones, but all in the same area. Can't we monitor the whole area ? We'd need about 50 teams on the street. Let's do it our way. Listen, we've cut everything away on that side. Now there's only this one and the other one down the street. - Okay ? - I'll handle it. Yes, ma'am, yes, ma'am. Your wife has called. She's pissed with you. I gotta go. Give me this. Let me talk to her. Hello, honey. Yes. Cool off, will you ? I'm going home, okay ? Bye. Our life used to be easier. Shit. Hello. Do you have the money, old man ? - Not all of it. - You should have it. Joe, do you copy ? He's right next to you. At 67. Number 67. If you make me call again, I'll fuck you up. Son of a bitch ! Don't shoot ! Don't shoot ! Hello. Hello. Hello. He'll call back. Today or tomorrow. Just remember it's a negotiation. Fucking job. - Where's Gremlin ? - We're getting screwed ! - Calm down ! - Are you scared ? - Stop it ! - I'll fucking kill her ! - Calm down. - Don't fuck it up ! - I'm out of here. - Son of a bitch ! Stop staring at me ! - You've trampled over Benício. - The kidnap agent ? - I did. - That's not the procedure. - You put her life in jeopardy. - Should the punks decide ? Should we just pay them off, period ? Lower your voice. This shit you've done has just deprived people of their public phones. But now we have a suspect. He's called Kanu. Ramos ran a check on him. We're sure. We know he's in Sapê. - Finding him, we'll find Camila. - Dead. We'd only find her corpse. Her family's been threatened. Screw up again, and they'll take her out. - You're putting her in jeopardy ! - We can't negotiate with thugs ! Isn't that what you've done your whole life ? Isn't it, 'Mineiro' ? I've never paid criminals off, sir. They've paid me. If it weren't for your commie boss, we wouldn't even be having this conversation. I didn't ask for this job. I was ordered to do it. So the next order is: get out of my way. Lie low, Santiago. Come in. Santiago ? The documents you'd asked for. - A friend did me a favor. - Great. May I ask what it's about ? Do you really want to know ? It was an exchange, right ? What do I get ? If Mendonça decides that heads will roll, I'll spare yours. So you've got a suspect ? Someone close to the family ? They say it's quite common... If you think I'll be your snitch, forget about it. - I just want to help. - You wanna help your candidate. You're concerned about the primaries and his votes. Asshole. Do you want to finish this off ? It'll relax you. It still has my lipstick on it. I don't smoke. We're going to Sapê to catch that negotiator. Mendonça, I've been handling this case well, and you're gonna listen to Santiago ? Let's make sure the girl lives. They've gotta pay. That's how it works. Her family's well- off. With all due respect, it's still your case, but we'll handle it my way. All right ? Let's go ! So we'll screw things up until they kick us out ? Stay, then. - Let's go, man. - Yes, let's. Come on, Joe, let's go. Take that costume off, 'cause you're not going to this circus. You'll take care of something else for me. Motherfuckers ! You're dead ! You're gonna die, you son of a bitch ! You're gonna die. Shoot them up ! You're gonna die. Take care, Joe. Hold it, man. Are you nuts, bro ? - Let me do the talking. - There'll be no talking. - I'm going inside. - Do you want to die ? Do you want to put it on my shoulders ? No need. I've got enough on my back. Hey ! All Star here ! Son of a bitch ! It ain't about you guys. Call Serginho. I'm coming in. This is fucking All Star ! Hold your fucking fire ! Shit. - Don't fucking shoot ! - Hold it, hold it ! Our problem is not with you guys. Come closer, bro ! I'll kill that son of a bitch. You again, All Star ? What the hell do you want ? There's no kidnapping in my area. Nope ? It looks like some people here don't know that. Like Kanu. Kanu... If you invade, things will go south, All Star. But Mendonça is the one in charge. You know his methods, right ? - Only Kanu ? - Just Kanu. Hold the fort. I'm leaving. No one will shoot you in the back. Keep cool. You're sick, All Star. Are you speaking or not ? Spit it out, faggot ! I don't have all day. I'll end up killing this motherfucker ! Let me talk to him. Do you want to teach me how to do my job ? Go ahead. But they've got the girl. And they'll find out about Kanu. If this guy isn't talking despite our good manners, what's gonna make him talk ? Do your job. - What's up, Santiago ? - He sang. Where's the den ? I'm Pastor Eusébio, a servant of Our Lord Jesus Christ and we're celebrating another victory in Christ. Leave it on. Come on. The right spot ? She wasn't there ! Someone took her, Congressman. - Is my daughter alive ? - I'm sure she is. Where's Benício ? Why are we talking to you guys, huh ? Where the hell is Mendonça ? Let Benício handle the case. He's experienced, he knows what do do. I've talked... General, why don't you just replace me with Benicio ? Son... you're officially in charge. But you can't make another mistake, Mendonça. - I really hope she's alive. - She is alive. Do whatever you have to do. SECRETARY OF PUBLIC SAFETY - Back to square one. - What a mess, huh ? We should have turned it all down. Now we're screwed. - You're really... - You don't listen to me ! Come with me. The girl was not there. Look at me, faggot. Will you look at me ? That's it. What do you want me to do with you ? You're the negotiator. You're involved in the kidnap. The others were dead meat. - Tell me. - I've talked. Who do you want me to fuck ? I've told you everything I know, boss. - Stop it ! I don't know ! - Talk ! - Speak, motherfucker ! - Easy, Sir. Tell me ! Who else ? Tell me ! Who else ? - Easy, Sir ! - Tell me ! - Sir ! - Shit ! Shit... You're the only one left. All your friends are dead. Who are you being loyal to ? Tell me. I don't fucking know anything else. - I used to work for Catatau... - He's fucking dead ! - Shit ! - Sir... Speak ! You will talk now, son of a bitch. Who else knew about the fucking den ? - Who ? Tell me. Tell me ! - I don't know. You don't know ? Really ? You don't know ? I'll write 'The Division' on you, if you don't talk, motherfucker. - So spit it out ! - Stop it ! Who else knows ? Tell me, faggot. Who the hell knew ? - Stop this shit. - Your last chance. Spit it out, faggot. Who else knew ? Shit ! - It's not about revenge. - It was this piece of shit's choice. And you knew his fate was sealed when we didn't find the girl. Bosco... POLICE In case you don't know, this is Francisco. He was twelve. They kept him for 23 days. He struggled, but died in hospital. Kidnap with extortion is like an ER patient. Life is at stake. If we make a mistake, someone dies. Now, if we must lose one life to win the war, so be it. From now on, no more doing business with kidnappers. We negotiate. That's it. No more money for gangsters ! No more deals, no more schemes, and no more ransoms. Santiago is the new investigation boss. And Ramos will be his second. Over to you, partner. You only need to stay at The Division if you want to help. If you don't want to, be my guest. Now we're in charge of everything. I and Ramos. Commissioners answer to Mendonça but it's still the same Division. So we're going to centralize. All information will be first given to me and Ramos. Let's get to work. Mendonça is no fool. Let's find Camila. We'll land on our feet. Then screw the Division. This invoice was headed towards the trash bin. Here's the address of an Ana Maria da Silveira Lima. - Tijolo's wife. - Robbery, swindle... Suspect in three other kidnapping cases. And are going to catch this motherfucker ? Come to me, I want to see your weenie. My weenie's going to meet your fanny. Weenie and fanny, oh boy. Castelo, call in the cavalry. Roberta, do you copy ? Missed a fuck, Weenie. This kidnapping business is going to be over. ...Anti- Kidnapping Division has been successful, with recent measures to control the trend that still frightens the people of Rio de Janeiro... You like playing boss, don't you ? How long has it been ? Venâncio ? - I'm sorry. - Cut, please. Nina's job is to make you cry. Mine is to make you governor. Kidnapping in Rio is now a lousy business. So release the victim and give in, 'cause we'll find you. Then it'll be your choice: come standing up or lying down. Just give up ! - Drop the gun, let the hostage go ! - Free the hostage ! Kneel down. That's it. Drop the gun. You're already fucked, bro. But you can tell me about your pal Gremlin. Adilson Neves, AKA Gremlin, was Catatau's boss, from the gang that kidnapped Camila. You've been introduced, right ? We found Gremlin dead. Executed. - Is Camila alive ? - Yes, I'm sure she is. It's all new: no direct connection with Kanu or Catatau, or any of those punks. It's a kidnapping of the kidnapping. We've lost Camila ! We lost her because of those assholes ! Shit ! She's my daughter too ! Hello, Rio. This is your friendly radio. Open the door and let Jesus's words inside your heart. End of the nightmare If this is your proposal, it's not enough for me. You should know that. I also know you're not happy with your position here. I've seen you looking at those photos. Is it vanity ? It is. But it's not just that. It's is my job. What do those guys want ? Justice ? No. Safety. That's what I sell. Are you inviting me to join your club ? Shut up ! Shut up ! Shut up ! Congressman, it's gonna be three million dollars. Or else your girl dies. It's your call. Why are you guys doing this to me ? Get me out of here. I can't take it anymore. - I don't want to die. - It's your call. You're going to kill my daughter. If the investigation falls through, we'll have to pay the ransom. The guys upstairs will want to interfere. They will pay up and start scheming again. They're already trying to. If that happens, we'll have to pay. Congressman ! Sir, had we paid he ransom, I'm sure... What do you want ? I don't want to meddle in your affairs. But I know you can get that money. Since day one, we've remained hopeful. We're sure Camila'll be back. It's hard, it gets harder each day, but... we can't lose faith in the police or in people's goodwill. Absolutely, Venâncio. What do you want this for ? Give me the names, and I'll explain later. ...a happy ending... I've come for Francisco's inquest documents. Some of them are still here, right ? Sure. I have them here. Thanks. - Sir... -Any connection with the previous case? Perhaps. There might be, sir. A few documents seem to be missing. Mr. Mendonça had given them to you. It's been such a long time... That boy unfortunately died, and other cases cropped up. If I can be of any assistance... Thanks. Sixteen- year- old Camila Couto has been in the hands of kidnappers for months. The family has just decided to make an appeal. For Camila's sake, not mine. The names. Who are the donors ? Venâncio, I don't want to speak in your place. - I can't do it. - It's your family. Your appeal. Camila... if you're watching me now, we haven't given up on you, sweetie. You're using the kidnapping to promote Venâncio ? What's up, Ramos ? Congressman, that's US$ 3 million. The guy screwed up. He muffed it. Can you believe the boy's family still had the tape ? It never made it here. Unbelievable. It's the same gun. An Austrian Glock. He's a cop, that's our bet. But I've done some research - take a look. He follows a pattern. He kills his victims. No pay, he kills. They pay, he kills so there's no trail. Remember the ditch where Mendonça found Francisco ? Corpses all over. It makes sense. Do you know what they'd found there ? Glock shells. And guess what they found in Camila's first den. Glock shells again. Joe, it's the same guy. He's gonna kill Camila. - As for the boy... - He killed him. Twice. Is this the same guy you saw at the hospital ? Robinho ? This is Roberta. Fine, thanks. You know the records about that retired officer ? Exactly. Holy shit. Quiet ! Be quiet. Quiet. No ! No ! What the fuck ? Let her go ! Let her go ! Get off me ! Are you nuts ? Have you lost your mind, huh ? Have you ? Respect me ! Shoot him. Finish what you've started. Shoot ! You're paying the ransom ? You're trampling on the police's recommendations ? Really ? Shit. It doesn't add up. Oh, God. Who else ? - Márcio ! - What can we offer him ? What does he want ? Find out ! Hello, my friend. Come in. Let's have a chat. I really need your help. We're not just friends. You know that we're family now. What's up ? Tell me. Close the door when you leave. Roberta, Benício is calling us. He has a job for us. That way. That's the cargo. What the hell, man ? It's our secret, Roberta. Paulo Antônio, Edmundo Sintra, Mundinho from Telecom. Nina Borba, our celebrity. The Executive, Legislative and Judicial branches, and the press - everyone's here. Wallace Farofa, Mariano from Mangueira, and, of course, Tavinho Cordeiro. Do you want to sell me this ? Do you want your freedom ? No. Then, why me ? You've got no strings attached. You stand up to the suits. And you've extorted an extortionist, right ? OK, I'll believe your selflessness and your admiration for me. But, if you want some advice, listen to me: don't do anything with that. Nothing at all. Use whatever is helpful in the girl's case, and put the rest away or throw it out. I was expecting something else from you. Maybe I should stop this whole process. For your sakes, not mine. Because now everyone knows what you're doing. - If you don't become heroes... - I get it, sir. We're going to talk and I won't lose my temper. Neither will you. Lift your shirt. Lift up your shirt. Son of a bitch ! Give me one reason not to screw you up ! Only one, you asshole ! - You exposed me... - Stop whining ! Be quiet ! Sit down. Sit ! What do you want ? How can I explain ? I like your friends. I do. I really do. Even that commissioner, who isn't really your friend. However, if they win, I lose. - Not just money. - I should... Fuck me up ? You're with us now, Roberta. Accept it. So just kill the girl. Paulo Antônio, Eduardo Sintra, Tavinho Cordeiro... Any more ? Is this another scheme ? How much do you want ? I'll pay. Three million dollars. I won't meddle with your campaign. I'll even vote for you. I'm trying to speak your language, Congressman, so you'll listen to me. If I pay, you guys lose. What you want is fame, you want to be heroes, with your photo taken at the rescue. If you want me to drop this case, I will. But tell me you won't pay or negotiate with them. Why should I trust you, huh, All Star ? Do you think I don't know who you are ? He's going to kill your daughter. Leave. - I know this motherfucker. - Tavinho Cordeiro. Strong influence on the police. Knows Venâncio well. So that's it ? This asshole's involved ? It's not his style, but he used to be a cop. - And he's got the means. - So he's a suspect. We know the guy. We can work it out without wasting ammo. Pull the trigger if you have to. Mr. Mendonça ? It's a great honor. Wipe that smile off your face. This place smells of blood. I've been in this business, I know how it works, so I'll tell you upfront: don't mess with me, or there will be consequences. A man's word. A man's ? And are you a man ? - Are you, asshole ? - We're here to talk. - Talk, here ? - Listen. - What's the deal, Santiago ? - The Congressman's daughter. That's why you brought me here ? That's why you killed my bodyguard ? Really ? I pulled the trigger, sir. And you messed up my jacket. Have a look. I should pay back and kill your bodyguard. Come on, Tavinho, start talking. Wrong guess, Santiago. You know I'm an ethical person. You guys are wasting your time. - Would I want that nigger up my ass ? - I'll show you the nigger. Please, sir. He'll cooperate. You shouldn't even be here. Fuck it. That's my call. We'll do it my way. Tell him, Santiago, that this will go south. - Sir. - Cool off, Santiago. Are you going to shoot him ? Shoot me. Come on. Shoot me. Come on. Come, come. Shoot me. Come on ! Shoot me. - Come on, man. Shoot. - Shit ! Gentlemen, we're in this together. Shit ! I'm on your fucking side ! I've already talked to the Congressman. I volunteered to find the guy who took his girl. But he's worried and scared. He wants to pay and end it. With the slush fund money ? Spit it out. He's collecting money with a few partners. He's been bargaining in exchange for some favors. In cash. Two, three million. - Off his woman's scheme. - Raquel's ? Raquel who ? I'm talking about that hottie, Ingrid. You're not getting it today, are you nigger ? If you won't stop, I'll shoot you myself. - Ramos. - Here, Joe. He used to be a cop. We don't know the details. He's retired. Do you recognize him ? From back in the day ? Perhaps. When I'm in cuffs, my memory doesn't work so well. Shit. Got you, motherfucker. Boss, take a look at this. It was inside the drawer. - Ramos ? - The negotiator's called. It's the same guy, the same voice as the tape's. - I'm coming. - But listen, Joe. He said he'll wait for you. He mentioned your name. That's three million dollars. Or else, I'll have to abuse her. I'll start by letting the boys play with her. I'll break her teeth and destroy that beautiful smile of hers. And just much later... will I kill your daughter. Santiago is there, right ? Put Santiago on the phone. There's no one here. I don't think you understand who's in charge. Will someone else need to die, Santiago ? Answer me ! Is that what you want ? I traced the kidnapper's call. A public phone inside Barroso Filho. - The hospital ? - Yeah. - Would you like one ? - No. You said I could count on your help. So... I want that Santiago guy off the investigation. And out of the police force. Joe ! Hey. Somebody, please ! Shit ! Mr. Santiago, will you make a statement ? What happened here, Mr. Santiago ? What about the charges ? Raul will be down there. - Don't you worry. - Are you going to kill that guy ? Venâncio. All of this will come out in a matter of days. Hours, maybe. So you'll do what you have to do. Santiago has to be taken off Camila's case and off all other investigations. Benício won't take Camila's case or run the Division. But you mustn't stop the payment. - If I do this, she'll die. - Who told you that, son ? The dirty cop or his partner ? Mendonça, Santiago is going to jail. Well... it's an unfair society. And the police's job is to make sure it remains that way. Why does kidnapping annoy so much ? Because you lose control. Because it crosses the line. And the police's task is to redraw the line. Now, if you take a closer look, what do you see ? Who finances crime ? Where does the money come from ? From the same place. Ransoms are paid with dirty money because it is a business network, which makes a lot of people rich. Let me be straight with you: kidnapping is financed by the victim. - Are you blowing it all up, sir ? - Yep. And it seems like you are too. I read the dossier. All skeletons are out of the closet. Even your deal with Serginho: they know it all. I had nothing to do with it. The governor wouldn't comment on Chief Paulo Gaspar's statements, but it's been heard from an informant... You're not going to jail on those charges. There's no evidence whatsoever. None. I would have busted you myself if there were. We're here defending the police. But then, out of the blue, this idiot, this asshole shows up. He has to be punished. Shut up. Shut up, shut up ! Congressman, that's three million dollars. Or else your girl dies. It's your call. Here's your friendly radio station. Our Lord Jesus Christ... Here's your friendly radio station. Our Lord Jesus Christ... Here's your friendly radio station. Our Lord Jesus Christ... Hello, listener. This is the radio of our Lord. Let His words inside your heart. He must be using the radio to muffle the girl's cries. We can't be sure yet, but we know it's a local pirate radio station. - Get it ? - So we know where it is ? - Did you hear the train ? - No. For God's sake, there's a steady railway sound. Joe, Camila's in Santa Cruz. That's where Francisco was kept. Not far from Dantas's house. They have an area for dirty business. Joe, Camila's there, trust me. Listen up. We'll have to involve the whole department. 200 men to scan the preacher's radio station area. A needle in a haystack, I know, but it'll work out. You're not in charge anymore. You don't run this Division. Forget it. - Are you really doing this ? - It's out of my hands. The guys upstairs decided. I'm just informing you. - It was that dossier, right ? - No. Blame it on your schemes. Your dirty business with the scum ! Sir... I've never lied to you. If you ask me to be honest, I'll confirm everything. But the accusations will screw us up. It's just politics ! It'll be my ass ! Ours ! Everyone's ! And Camila will get killed. What about your business with Serginho ? It's part of the charges. Will you deny it ? You screwed me up, Santiago. Were you scheming with Tavinho too ? How much did you give that asshole, huh ? You screwed up. Now you'll pay for it, bro. - That's it. - What about your screw- ups ? Have you paid for them ? What about when we screwed up together ? What about Kanu ? - Who's hands are clean here ? - If I have to kill, I'll kill. Kanu is just a collateral damage. So I'm the only bad guy ? Murder and torture are OK ? - Fuck it. - Really ? Fuck it all. Fuck it ! Fuck it ! Where do you think you are ? Do you think you're Robin Hood in this shit ? Hell, no ! You're a vulture, a crook, a player. You know that's not true. Do you think you're better than me ? Is that it ? Tell me. Is that what you think ? You're better than me ? We're just fucking cogs in this wheel, sir. I'm not your enemy. I've never been. Do whatever you want. Salute the suits. Take me off the investigation. But don't miss this opportunity. It'll be the only one. Wait. Are you guys sure about this shit ? Yes. Well, everyone has read about it in the papers and heard about it on the radio. Very well. Fuck it. Santiago is in charge of this operation. I don't need to explain why. So, when I conclude here and he begins speaking, I'll be speaking through him. Let's not waste time here. For safety reasons, only the leaders have the details. Full drill, just on the spot. Régis is there with his bag. Give him your cell phones. We'll communicate via radio. Single frequency, so that everybody can hear. Commissioners, come with me. It's gotta be today. Call the Congressman. Tell him he has 3 hours to pay. 3 hours. That's it. In the Chevy. No. I'll ask someone to pick it up. Your cell phone, Benício. Okay. I'm finishig up. One sec. Sure. Finish up. No, it's okay. I'm done. The other one too. Pick your team. Five minutes. Let's go. Get out, Roberta. Jailton, you're coming with me. Come here. I need you somewhere else. Get a car. Any car. You're picking up a suitcase in the trunk of a Chevy. Wait ! Wait ! I don't know, sir. - Get up ! Up ! Against the wall ! - Have you seen her ? Follow the driver. Go ! Turn the headlights off. Turn them off ! - Get in the car. Come on ! - Or else ? Or else I'll shoot you right here, Joe. Get in the fucking car. - I was given orders to... - Cut the crap, Roberta. Cut the crap ! I could turn you in and make your life miserable, but I want to give you a chance. Let's start with Camila. Where is she ? No, no ! - Spit it out ! - Camila's in Santa Cruz. I don't know where exactly. I can try to call. - I can try something out. - Shut up, shut up ! The Division is already there. Stop stalling. What's the address ? - I don't know ! - Say it ! I just know it's a football pitch by the railway, but I don't know on which street it is exactly. You fucking bitch. Joe, do you copy ? - Do you copy, Joe ? - We intercepted the ransom money. As for their den, look for a football pitch by the railway. Get it ? Search for the football pitch. Joe, do you copy ? Do you fucking copy ? Ramos, do you hear me ? Do you hear me, Ramos ? Do you fucking copy ? Joe ! Shit ! Do you copy, Ramos ? State Police ! Nobody get out of the car. Guns down ! Put your fucking gun down ! Piss off ! Piss off ! All units. Head for the field at Menino Jesus Square. Menino Jesus Square. Go ! Listen up. There'll be no payment. - Kill the girl. - That's a negative, partner. Shit. Let's go. Go the fuck on. Go, go ! It's over, brother. Let her go. Mr. Mendonça, do you copy ? And I must pay these detectives my compliments: Antônio Ramos and Juliano Santiago, whose job was of paramount importance in this mission. These men restored the population's faith in the Police Force and they saved lives. Mendonça has proved many people wrong. So, if things have changed, If we've eliminated kidnapping from Rio, I'm still sure of one thing: life is priceless. Commissioner Luiz Henrique Benício is likely to take over the Force, replacing Paulo Gaspar who has been fired. It comes as no surprise. The Police has a clear mission... To serve the interests of the elite. That's not my mission. I lasted longer than I thought. Secretary of State Security General Malta preferred to omit any details during the event in which Mr. Venâncio Couto was confirmed to run for governor of the state of Rio de Janeiro. Venâncio Couto welcomes delegate Benicio at an event in his cabinet DB- DELEGATE BENICIO IN THREE YEARS, KIDNAPPING CASES FELL FROM 132 TO ZERO SINCE 1997 THERE HASN'T BEEN A KIDNAPPING EPIDEMIC IN RIO DE JANEIRO ALL OTHER CRIME RATES WENT UP THE DIVISION
