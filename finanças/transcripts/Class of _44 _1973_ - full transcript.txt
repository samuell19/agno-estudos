KEEPING IN MIND THAT THE OLD BALLADEERS TOOK THEIR SONGS FROM ONE TOWN TO THE NEXT, WAS IT ANY WONDER THAT NEW STANZAS WERE IMPROVISED AND ADDED ALONG THE WAY? WELL, WAS IT? OF COURSE NOT! NOR WERE THESE ADDED VERSES NECESSARILY TRUE. FOR MUCH OF THE LYRICS WERE LITTLE MORE THAN PURE FICTION. NOW WHY DO I SAY THAT? I'LL TELL YOU WHY. BECAUSE THOUGH MUCH OF THESE BALLADS ARE ACCEPTED AS GOSPEL, IT BECOMES PATENTLY OBVIOUS [BELL JINGLES] THAT THEY HAVE LITTLE OR NO BASIS IN TRUTH. [BELL CONTINUES JINGLING] AND WHO WERE THESE TROUBADOURS WHO CARRIED THESE SONGS FROM HAMLET TO HAMLET? I'LL TELL YOU WHO. THEY WERE ROUSTABOUTS AND DRUNKARDS AND DRIFTERS AND NE'ER-DO-WELLS, OAFS, LOUTS, CLODS, AND BUMPKINS! [SECOND BELL JINGLES] AND YET, HOW MANY OF THE LAWS AND LEGENDS WITH US TODAY [THIRD BELL JINGLES] ARE FOUNDED ON THE ACCEPTED VERACITY OF THESE VERY UNTRUTHS, MERELY BECAUSE THEY RHYMED OR BECAUSE IT WAS POSSIBLE TO SET THEM TO SOME PLEASANT TUNE? [BELL JINGLES] I'LL TELL YOU HOW MANY. [JINGLING GROWS LOUDER] FOR EXAMPLE, THIS BALLAD WAS SUNG IN THE DAYS OF '49, ON THE WESTERN MIGRATIONS. NOW, WHO COMPOSED IT AND WHEN ARE UNKNOWN. THE LYRIC IS: "DON'T YOU REMEMBER SWEET BETSY FROM PIKE? "WHO CROSSED THE BIG MOUNTAIN WITH HER LOVER IKE. WITH 2 YOKES OF OXEN, A LARGE YELLOW DOG..."
