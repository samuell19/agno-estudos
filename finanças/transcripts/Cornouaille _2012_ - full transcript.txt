Subtitles translated, corrected & extended by JJ Are you in a hurry today? I have an office meeting at 3:00. I won't be here next week. Where are you going this time? Luxor, Tbilisi? To Quimper. Where's Quimper? In Finister. You organising trips to Finistere? No. It's about the house. We have five minutes. Two and a half. See what I can do in two and a half minutes! Wait, I'll fix it. Excuse me, sir. The wife has a meeting at 3 p.m. And because she's a bit neurotic, she's terrrifed she'll lose the respect of co-workers if she's two minutes late. Could you perhaps...? Ok! My wife is neurotic? If I said "my mistress", it wouldn't work. Are you coming with me? I'm two minutes away. No, I mean Monday at Quimper with me. No, I'm sorry. Forget it. No, no, not at all. Don't apologize, it's just... complicated. It would be our first night together since... Yes, since that time. Is the train from Montparnasse? At 15.08 h. Oh I understand. I'll do my best. Shouldn't we meet on the platform? You don't have luggage? I can't go with you. Thelma broke her arm while exercising. Marianne is with her in hospital, and I'm going back. Is it bad? No, a simple break, but... she's very frightened. Poor thing. I'm sorry. It's me who's sorry, because... I wanted to at least kiss you before you go. That's nice. I mustn't miss my train. See you soon. HOUSE IN BRITTANY [Cornouaille is like Cornwall in French] Notary Mevel? Yes. Odile Cauret. Ah yes, absolutley. Can I take your suitcase? No need, thank you. I parked the car in front. Over there. You approached me immediately. Pardon? You knew right away it was me. Is it so obvious that I'm a notary? Well, aren't you? Yes, of course, but... who wants to look like a notary, huh? Err... notaries?! I thought I'd take you straight to the house to sign the house-sale papers - Does that suit you? - Yes, great. Thank you, you're very kind. Any better? Yeah, nothing serious. I already have an agency that can take on the sale of the house. Your aunt's heart atttack was so sudden. It must be very sad for you. Frankly, I barely knew her. The agency is "Real Estate Finistere". But I haven't made it exclusive. Maybe you can find a buyer? You should look at the house first. It's by the sea, in the middle of nowhere. You may not want to sell it. Aren't you interested in business? Yes, yes, of course. It's my profession, after all. It's the tie that marks me as a notary? It's bland, no? Maybe a fun pattern? Maybe. There you are! It's a lot smaller than I remember. How old were you then? 12 years. It's normal. It's always like that. - Here are the keys. - Thank you. I'll turn on the water. It's got a little leak. It's muddy. - That's kind. - You're welcome. Can you give me more light? I can't see anything here. What was that? The house keys. Cathy. Cathy. I'm coming. - Good afternoon, Daniel. - Good afternoon, Cathy. This is Ms. Odile Cauret, Bernardette's niece. Over there. Well, that's not good I'm sure she left them there. She showed several times. You don't have spares? No, they used to be here. Erwan is with his father. He would know. Erwan is my son. He was with your aunt the whole time. I can call my ex-husband because of an emergency. No, no, I've bothered you enough already. I'll find a hotel in Audiern for the night. That's be no problem You're certainly not going to a hotel. That would be silly. Hello? It's good, I'm not home, we don't have to whisper. Me neither. But I don't want to wake the neighbors. Which neighbors? Key problems. - Listen, I wanted to... Good evening, Fabrice. You have a bike now? I might buy one. I'm thinking about it. This situation is not for me. The secrets, the lies, it's not me. Do you want us to break up? I didn't say that. I wouldn't die if we break up. It's not the first time you've left me. Pardon? Are you kidding me? I seem to remember it was you who left me 10 years ago. Yes.... ok... technically, perhaps, but to be honest, the intention was clearly yours. Intention? Good evening. ... ok, good night. I have them. Shall I unlock your garage too? Yes, that would kind. Wait, I'll ask my father. I'll be right there. Father! Father! Father! Father! Dad has an asthma attack. Dr. Huët arrives in half an hour. What's mummy to do? Call the paramedics? I don't know what to do. Breathe, Breathe. Stay over there. I don't know what to do. The keys to the car in the garage. I'm going. - I'm going to Audierne. - Can I go with you? You could drop me at the bridge. That would be kind. It's on your way. I'll show you. Are you going to take the coast road? I don't know. I don't recognise any of it. The sea is more beautiful. In fine weather you can see the island of Sein. Well, not from here, but... Do you know the children's song? Whoever sees Molene sees his grief. Whoever sees Ouessant sees his blood. Whoever sees the Seine sees his end. And that's a children's song? That is a monument for the Anaons... a group of souls doomed to wander. It is said that the souls of the drowned... Isn't there a local legend that has nothing to do with death? Nope! You'll stay for how many nights? I don't know yet. One or two. Not much time to enjoy the fresh air. I don't enjoy it so much. Thanks. What are you doing here? Odile? How glad I am to see you. Hello. Let's have a drink I brought a bottle of cider. Now you can light a nice fire. But you have the house keys? You don't remember me? I'll give you a hint... Pavec's children. Go on! Guess who I am. I'm sorry, but Le Pavec's children means nothing to me. It's not nice to forget your first boyfriend. Loïc Le Pavec, the first guy you ever kissed. You can remember that, surely? But I can remember that very well. The first boy I kisssed was Mathieu Fourier in 4th grade. No, it was me. Loïc Le Pavec. In the summer when you were 12 years old. I can show you under which tree it happened. My brother engraved our names on it. Did my aunt give you the spare keys? Of course. She showed me where she hid them. Bernardette and I were close. Especially after Marc's death. Did you know about Marc? Marc? Which Marc? My little brother. You were the same age. He drowned three years ago. I didn't know. I'm sorry, really. Did my aunt give you the keys? If you want, I can put them back in their usual place. No, give them to me. I'll hand them over to the agency. You're going to sell the house? You can't do that. You loved being here so much. You've really changed. You hardened, closed in on yourself. Give me the keys. Ah yes. Right. Good... I'm going. Thanks for the cider and firewood. You're welcome. You mustn't chop wood in your condition. In what condition? You're pregnant, yes? No, not at all. - Hello. - Hello. I know who you are. Good for you! I don't know who you are. I'm Katel. I live there. But in the evening, I'm with Cathy, your neighbor. You throwing that away too? No, you can take it if you want. Will you join us for our magic stuff? What magic stuff? In the your shed. Bernadette lets me play there with the others. No, I'm just looking after the house. I'll leave you all to your magic stuff. Ok. Fabrice, it's me. Call me if you can. It's over! I can’t be in this relationship. I'm leaving you. You don't care. You're not saying a word to keep me. Why are you leaving me? I told you I didn't want to have a child! But you've made one behind my back! I don't understand. In any case, It's me who's the father. What? Here... Look. It's carved, yes? It's completely absurd. It doesn't prove you're the father. Dad, did you know I was pregnant? Only because you've just told me. Does it make you happy? Is this something you wanted? I don't know. I was not expecting it at all! Is it by someone you love? I don’t know if I can be in love. This man has come back into my life many times. Do you think I should keep the baby, anyway? I don't know. I don't know about your life. I don't know you. You were 12 when I died. You're almost my age now. So you know nothing about me? No. And you... have you forgotten me a lot? I've been dead for 20 years. All traces of me have almost been erased. If I had this baby, you wouldn't know him? No. Odile? Odile? Odile. It's not good to sleep on wet sand. It'll make you ill! How did you know I was pregnant? You see, I was right! Are you happy? Was the baby planned? No, it wasn't. Will the Dad be happy? No. Are you married? No. Do you live together? Not at all. He lives with another. A child should not be sentenced to a life without a father... no security, without protection. Yeah, well... Marc and I, we had a father. Rather, we had to protect ourselves from him. The blows we took from him... Do you remember him? Unfortunately, no. I don’t remember my childhood well. I don't even remember my father very well. I recognize him in his photo. I know it's him. But the memories are very dim. You don't know how to live with your dead? You can't be on good terms with the living, if you can't live with the dead. I never said I was on good terms with the living. It's true, you're really hard. I find you very distrustful, not very interested in others at all. You're lucky to be cute. You appear really sensitive at heart By what right are you telling me this? We're friends, no? No, not at all. We've not known each other very long. It'll come back to you. Were you sitting there yesterday, when I was driving by? I love coming here and thinking of Marc. At home, my parents made a shrine with a lot of memories. I'd rather come here. In the open air. Rather than the cemetery? There's no grave. His ship sank. No bodies were found. Oh shit, my cousins must be waiting. Say, by the way... Thomas, Antoine? Yes, we're here. - Freud, I'm telling you. - What? Hello. When did you get here? Hi Ten minutes ago. Coffee? Yes. Did you buy bread from Fredon? Yes. No, always buy bread from Gonidec. Everyone knows that. Fredon is only for croissants. And even that's debatable! How did you get in? We took the hidden spare keys. Where? Under the pot at the entrance. No, they weren't there. Is this some sort of inquisition? Not too much. Thanks. What are we supposed to eat? Art books, Chinese hats, yellow chest of drawers, model ship, collection of bottles, silverware. - Hansel and Gretel. But of course... Hansel and Gretel. Hansel and Gretel, the Colombian statue. The Racoon. I know, we look like predators. Not at all, take what you want. I won't keep anything. What is 'Nicolas Billiards' What does it look like? Like billiards, just round. You afraid of spiders? Yes. Nothing serious. Continue. Are there any ghosts? Yes! Ask Aunt Bernardette's ghost, where she put the Calvados! - Is this what Mum wanted? - Yes. I'm so pissed off. She doesn't know anything about the house. She doesn't care. She's going to trash a home that we adore. - Why did she inherit it? - Because she's the poor orphan. "Leave it all to Odile, her father's dead." "She needs to be helped." Haven't we given her enough already? Where's "The Club of 5" book? I've no idea. The bedroom library? - You think so? - Yes. Why did I she leave me this damn house? I hoped to redeem myself. Redeem for what? When your father started choking, I panicked. I didn't respond well. It was a question of minutes, and I lost them. I didn't get married, I didn't start a family. How could I have children if I'd already made an orphan? It really turned your life upside down too? We are all connected. All of us are connected to each other. Didn't you know that? I'm sorry the house doesn't make you happy. It’s hard to know what will make you happy. Well, did you find it? Yes, I'm coming. It's there! Ah! Can you tell me where you stashed the Calvados? There they are, the cheese thingies. - Hi Jean-Yves. - Hello, how are you? - Did they change your spot? - Yes, they did. They are great. What do you fancy? I don't know. Peaches. We'll have some peaches, please. Hello, Fabrice Labret. Leave a message, please. It's Odile. I just wanted to say I'm fine. Although it's a little different here. It's a little bit... well, different! The little neighbour is like a vampire and my childhood friend is like a serial killer! Only the notary looked like a notary. And me, err... I'm pregnant... But you mustn't worry. I'll stay here for a few more days. Then deal with my... 'little problem' before I go back to Paris. There, it's going to be fine. Everything is under control. Besides that... err... Besides that, the air is very good here. I.... - Things, a bit metaphysical. - Oh! Gently... Towrads the thing... Oh la la, No, no no... I see you. You're blowing on the ball... Don't let go, that's it, that's it. - She's got nothing left, - No juice left. Commitment! Don't spit! Where's the bottle? I'll get it. Don't cheat while I'm away... No, no, no! We're playing.. - There you go! - Ah! Hold on, two seconds. - Don't hold back! Bah, bah, bah! - I'll have some too. That's it, it's had its effect. Off you go! Do you want a present? Big sucker! - Ah, that's nice. - And elegant. That's it... Commit. - You have everything? - Yes, thank you. You were cool. Really! Oh yes, we couldn't find a photo album. It's in a red box with gold patterns on top. If you get you hands on it... If I find it, I'll put it aside for you. Promise! Are you sure you really want to sell it? It's such a great place here. I always thought my kids would run around this beach too. What's this with the violins? Come, shut up! Let her live! Bye. Bon Voyage. Hello Ah, hello. What are you doing? I accidently threw away a photo album, and... I just can't reach it. You want to retrive it? Yeah, but it's too deep. I don't know how to get to it Katel, will get it. No, no, don't put her in the trash. Yes, I will look for it. Where is it? It's there. The red one there. Ah, that's it. Thanks. Bravo. Odile. Ok? Who is this? Here's me when I was little with Loïc and Marc Le Pavec. Loïc was the one who drowned. No, it was his brother Marc who drowned. I saw Loïc just yesterday. Have you seen a ghost? No, I saw Loïc Le Pavec and I even talked to him. He's fine. Erwan, is your mum at home? Yes. - Off you go. - Don't push me. If the drowned don't get a "proella" cross they become ghosts. - Ah, nooo... And at night... they come to visit the little girls. - Hello. - Hello Would you like some coffee? No. I won't bother you. Do you know of any gynecologist for me in Audiern, please? Of course. One moment. Katel, Mom called. You have to go home. I'm not going alone. There's a ghost in the house. What ghost? What nonsense have you told her again? When it's not the goblins, it's vampires or ghosts! You really want to to traumatize her? Ah, I can see Loïc. You can make sure he's not... The little neighbors think you're a ghost. The locals can’t stand me because I don’t live like them. Oh no, they're just children Loïc. They're only joking. Ok, let's say that... You see me, so I exist. Shall we go down to the beach? Come on. Don't be afraid. Come closer. We have to wait for the big wave. Now! - I won! - No. No, you got soaked. The game is not to get wet. You lost! You're still full of it and a bad loser. You see, you remember how we used to play like that! Look. Have you ever seen anything more beautiful? Would you mind if I sleep on your sofa? I argued with my parents. I'm not in the mood to go home. Loïc. What is? Can't sleep? Were you with me the day my father died? Yes. Can you describe it to me? We came back from the beach. You went into the house. And I followed you. Bernardette was in a complete panic. She sent us out very quickly. Then... we waited in the garden. Until the ambulance arrived. Yes. We were on a the swing. You were pushing me It was never high enough for me. By the time ambulance arrived, dad was already dead. Yes, that's right. Then... I went with you to the bedroom to see the body. You were afraid to go alone. It was very nice of you. You were my best friend. I would have done anything for you. Good morning. -Hello. Thanks for the brioche. Have you been to Godinec? Yes. I'm making some calls this afternoon. I'll come over to value your house clearance. - See you very soon. - See you soon, bye. So, we have several appointments this afternoon. I've also scheduled an open-house on the site. I made a booklet Check for errors. An 'open-house' obviously attracts all the curious and bored ones. But a view like that, it's easy to fall in love with it. Above all, don't say anything. Refer any questions to me. Can I say hello, or should I disappear right away? Friendly... Always be friendly. That's what's important!. Good day. Did you see the view? Yeah, fantastic. Let’s start with the living room. Guttering seem to be in good condition. We're going to check out the kitchen. The plan. Come in, come in. What a view, huh? What are you doing here? Are you planning to buy the house? No, of course. But you didn't call me back Ah, there you are. What a view... exceptional! A young couple want to check the condition of the roof. Could you watch their baby while I take them up to the attic? Ok... you know where to go? This house has no secrets for me. Thanks. Thank you. Bravo. Excuse us, we have to go. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Good day. Have you seen that amazing view? This is the owner, miss Cauret. We can go here. This is not a good time. I'm going to go. I'll see you. You see him? I could tell right away that he was not a buyer, just curious. - Excuse me. - Yes? Fabrice, wait for me at the harbour. We need to talk. I don't know why you came. You don't have to worry. I will solve this. The appointment's already made. It'll all be sorted out before I return to Paris. But it's you I care about you. I didn't hear from you. I thought you were not well. I thought that... What? That I'm just interested in you having an abortion as soon as possible? What am I to you? An old obsession? An addiction? You couldn't get me out of your head And you give me a little place in the Hotel Des 5 Mondes from 1 to 3 p.m.? I'm protecting your family and marriage. I'm respecting your life for you. It's me who decides whom to protect in my life. It's not for you to decide for me. No one is forcing you to deal with this on your own. I'll call you. I'll come. I'm here to talk with you, to decide together what to do. Stop playing the victim. Like you want to keep this child, It’s too easy to say I'm the bad guy. It's obvious you want me to have an abortion. Do you really think that? Yes that's really what I think. I feel sad, tired and scared. And feel lonely. And I don't know what to hold on to anymore. There, now you know everything. You could take me in your arms, please? I can't, I'm sorry. Not here, not now in front of everyone. You two are so bad together. How did you even think of having a child? I guess I was an accident. We were young. We were a beautiful couple. We loved each other. I wanted to have kids with her. I always thought that it was you who wanted children. You thought I didn't love you because you couldn't comfort me after his death. But, it was not your role. So, what was my role... What was my place? I was a burden to you. No. I loved you. How did you not feel that? You always wanted to be the strong one, the most responsible. As if you were trying at all costs not to be like me. I didn’t want to be a sad woman. But you are sad! Not because you've lost your love. You're sad because you can't love. Will you continue like this? I love my job. I set up a travel agency. Business is booming. It has a very good reputation. But who'll bring you your cup of herbal tea, if you get sick? Aren't you proud of me, Dad? I'm dead. It's up to you to be proud and happy with what you're doing. Can I drop you off somewhere? Like I said, the abortion pill is taken at the doctor's office. in two doses, 48 hours apart. We can take the first one on Thursday at 3 p.m. Thursday at 3 o'clock That's perfect. - What are you doing? - Voodoo ritual. Are you going to strangle that chicken? No. It's his mother's chicken. Obviously, we won't strangle it. We're just having fun. We drive away ghosts. But Katel, there are no ghosts. They don't exist. They are like devils, dragons... Father Christmas They're fictional, not real. But Father Christmas exists. For Christmas, he'll bring me a puppy. Where's the chicken? It's escaped. Why did you leave the door open? The rite's ruined. No, you said I could do it with you. How can we without a chicken? - We can, we can. - Are we doing a 'proella'? - Yes, we are! What's a 'proella'? - An imaginary burial of a drowned man. - So cool! So... First, a wax cross. It's in the bush! Erwan, bring the net! And you just left her? With a lighted candle in hand? 6 year old girl? What do you have in you head? Cottage cheese? I've never seen such an irresponsible and selfish person. When will you be able to take care of someone other than yourself? Let people into your bubble, Erwan. You're not the only one in the world. Grow up! Would you like to see my blister? Excuse me. What's my problem? Don't worry. Everything will be different with the child. I've arranged for an abortion. You don't want to keep the baby? I just told you, I'm nothing. I can't live with anyone, living or dead. And besides, I won't have a father for this child. You'll find one later. It's always the other way around with you. You were orphaned before you grew up. You got pregnant before you fell in love. And look... Before you live in it, you empty the house. I've emptied the house to sell it. Not to I live in it. That's what you think. Look, the baby could sleep in Bernardette's office. Not here. I know. But this room has to have to life breathed into it. Look, you will color it Malabar pink and your daughter will enjoy it like a princess. - Malabar pink? - Yes What are we going to do here? This is Bernardette's room. It has the prettiest view. Let it be your room. But the bed should be placed against the window. - Shall we do it? - Ok! One, two... Over there. You could grow vegetables in the garden. Yes, and there can be a Turkish sauna in the shed. Can you put tomatoes in with the corgettes? I'd love a teak pontoon that would go down to the sea. Imagine 500m of pontoon to the beach. No, seriously, that would be cool. Seriously, I'd love a pontoon. - Would you prefer eggs or ham? - Ham. You ok? What is it, my little girl? Dad is here. There's Mommy. Is that Thelma? Yes. Is your hand better? I did it on purpose so dad wouldn't sleep with you. I hate you doing that. You know about me? I don't want you around. You leave Dad with me. I completely understand. I only want what's best for you. I will always respect your family. Don't try to confuse me. I know what you want. You do? Keep your hands off my dad, whore. Hello? Hello, Miss. Cauret? - Yes. - Sorry to interrupt. This Dr. Tribidik's office. You haven't confirmed your abortion. Are you still planning to come? Odile? Some van is here. It's the junk dealer from Audierne. I'm coming. Why did you call him? He's a crook. He should be thrown into the harbour, jerk. Don't deal with him. He won't get the better of me. And I have to get rid of all the furniture - Good day. - Good day. - Hard to find? - No, I've been here before. - At Le Pavec's house. - Yes. Did they recommend me? I think so, yes. Come on, Fred. - Good day. - Good day. - 1,500... - 3,000. Haha! Let's not get carried away! I'm not really very business like... - You're not? - Ah, no... I can tell you... with my temperament... I'd be better working in the humanitarian field. Really? Well, you have drifted from that somewhat! Well no, not at all! I clean up people's lives. It's a public health mission. 1,750 2,500. For you, this weighs what? 500, 600 grams? Huh? But no, in memories, it weighs a ton. I'll take it all off your hands. In one visit, I'll do you more good than 10 years of psychoanalysis. It's you who should pay me! Well, right. 2,000 - 2,200 - 2,000. Is this the Etrave restaurant? Are you still doing the gourmet menu with the lobster in the pot? Great! So, a table for two at 8pm Loïc. - Good day. - Good day. Excuse me, is that the Le Pavec family farm next door? Yes. They 're not there anymore? No! Le Pavecs went to a retirement home. A long time ago. After the death of their son. Nobody lives there at all? No. The property's been on sale for a long time. Today, no one wants to farm. The second son certainly won’t. Thanks. Eh, that old thief's gone - bastard! Why didn't you tell me your parents' farm was empty? Because I have no right to be there. I removed the 'For Sale' sign. Were you afraid I would report you? Why didn't you tell me, Loic? What are you saying? That I'm a loser? Homeless? No, it's just that you have troubles. I told you about mine. It's not like I would tell just anyone! That so? Your problems interest me. Troubles that have soul, that make you reflect. Me, I have problems of poverty. How to keep warm and wash my clothes. How can I tell myself, in all my shit, that I'm not a shit too? You sharing your problems is almost a social promotion for me. Is it impossible for you to trust me? You're not a bad girl, Odile, but you're still a Parisian. If I had told you everything, you'd never have opened your door to me. Isn't that right? Yes, that may be true. Then Marc bought his boat. He was up to his neck in debts. But at least he was his own boss. He was to marry his girlfriend the following summer. He was a good son. "The best always go first", it seems. Ah, you know, it's just a saying... You see... with all that we've been through, each in our own way... I'm sure we'd make good parents. It would be very nice to raise your child together. You don't think I could be a good father? But with a purpose in my life, I could put up with a boss and get a job again, and all that It's just having a goal that I was missing. Do you understand? Yeah, maybe. This baby's not wanted by you. But it will help us to find our place. And you know what... it doesn’t bother me at all that it’s from another man. That's not important. I don't know what you're getting at. I'm not having a child, Loïc. I took my first abortion pill today and I will take my second tomorrow. I don't know what you were thinking. I told you about the abortion. How could you do that? We talked about that... The little girl's room, the office... all that. We were messing around. No... we weren't. How could you imagine that we would start a family? We hardly know each other. You took advantage of me? I'm a loser to you. You, you... You spat out your confidences to me like into a spittoon? Like a doormat? You can get away with anything with a loser like me? Eh? Go ahead... Tell me. You're a fine bitch! You make yourself out as great, but you're just like me at heart. There's no one in the world who loves you. Everyone to whom you meant something is dead and buried. Loïc, you can't talk to me like that. I think it's better you go, now. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to. What are you doing here? How did you get in? Listen, I know I came across badly just now. I must have seemed flipant Don't judge me. There's no need to be afraid of me. What is happening to us is very important. This is our only hope for happiness. Let's not waste it. Go. Stop it. - No. - Come on. Stop! You were right. We can't keep this baby. We'll have our own child. A child of love. That's much more beautiful. Odile. Odile. Open for me. Odile, please. Be kind. Odile, open up. Open up! Cathy! Cathy, help! Help! What is it, Odile? Erwam, call your mum, quickly! She went to the movies in Quimper. What happened? Loïc went crazy. Call the police. Don't go inside. It's dangerous. Call the police! Erwan. Erwan. Are you there? Can you open for me? I bumped into the lamp. He's gone? No, I didn't see anyone. But the lamp, I didn't see it. It's broken... There was no one upstairs. The door was locked. And this... You think I did it to myself? I didn't say that. But it can't Loïc Le Pavec, because drowned with his ship three years ago. You arrived afterwards, did you see anyone? No, nobody. And it can't be Marc Le Pavec? He's always been weird, yes? Well, yes. Except he left the region right after his brother died. And we never saw him around here again. What the hell have you done again? Do you have one for me? Keep it down, I'm not supposed to smoke. My mum would report me to the police. It's all right, they've gone. Thank you. You were very brave to come to my rescue. When I said about Loïc, did you think I was going crazy? Not too sure. I must have wanted to get to the bottom of it. Coming to the rescue of a crazy woman in need. You're even braver than I thought. You really don't look crazy! Well, I think I'm, becoming so. I've seen a lot of weird things things since I arrived here. Less real than Loïc. I knew they didn't exist, But I could see them. Were you having hallucinations? Honestly, I don't know anymore. The police will go to Le Pavec's farm to check for a duvet or backpack. At least we'll know if someone was there or not. He would have had time to get away with his stuff. So we won't know for sure. We'll never know if I'm nuts or not, right? In your place I would choose to tell myself... that I saw a ghost. I messed up with him again just now. It's getting late, can I put some sheets on the sofa for you? You good? It's strange though... This is our first night together in 10 years... Not to make love, but to have an abortion. Yes. Very romantic! Loïc told me I do everything the wrong way round. In a bad way. He may have been right, but... but what is the natural order of things? Did you and your wife plan for your daughter? No, not at all. We hadn't known each other for so long. However, we decided to keep the baby and get married. Would you have stayed together if you didn't have Thelma? I can't answer that question. Will it hurt? I don't know. It's good to have you here. Thanks. - Odile. - Loïc? Has it started? Uh, no. Not yet. Look, glow worms. You're freezing, come back to bed. What are you doing? I'll keep the house. What? I'm selling it anymore. I'll keep it. You have nothing left. You've completely emptied it. Exactly. I will fill it with my own stuff, cheap Ikea furniture. And with stuff that the junk shop will sell me for a lot of money. Here I will spend my holidays here I'll invite my cousins. to play Nicolas billiards. I will transform the office into a guest room. or a children's room. You can bring your daughter. And choose with me a big bed.... for the bedroom... If you want! What are you saying? Choose me. That's what I'm saying. Choose me! Me, the girl you have you have no baby with. Sorry, I must seem mad. No, really, you don't. You've never seemed so much like a human. I've been hoping for this, but some other point in my life. Now the situation is different. It can change. - I have changed. - Very good. You've changed. Great! But does that mean the whole world must change with you? Sorry, Odile. I can't answer you like this right now. It's much too... I'm touched by what you're telling me. I really am... To hear those words from your mouth and... I don’t know if I can make that decision. I understand. Come home quickly. Lt's meet in Paris as soon as possible. Don't stay here alone for too long. - Hello! - Hello, Cathy. - Is Erwan here? - Err, yes. Erwan. Who is this guy? Saint They. Who is this St. They? Well... we dress it with the baptismal robe of a child who died this year.. Oh fuck! This can't be right. Do we have to do this 'proëllo' right here? Why do you want to do a 'proëlla' if you don’t believe in it? Because... Because I believe in a few things Loïc said to me. Is it easier to trust a ghost than a homeless person? Hey, hello! So, you sold the house then? Oh, no, I'm not selling it anymore. You don't recognize me? Yes, yes, but I.... Notary Mevel. Oh dear! Ah, but of course. I'm sorry, I... It's normal. No problem! Without my tie, I don't look at all like a notary. Have a great day. You too. Something should be said, yes? I wish you good luck, and peace, and rest..... and serenity, wherever you are now... be it with the lost souls of Anaon... or buying pot at Perpignan Station The cross fetches the soul of the drowned and brings it back to the right place... On Christian land. Yeah, well...
