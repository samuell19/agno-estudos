Good morning, judge. I'll tell him you're here. - Thank you. Won't you come through? Come in. I've finished the preliminary investigation into Orlando Di Giovanni. "It is recommended to refer the defendant to trial for the crime of homicide." I ask you to accept my resignation. Sit down, please. You are young, courageous... and arrived preceeded by the most glowing of reputations. Why do you want to give up on this brillant career? You have gained great experience in those areas where the life of a judge can be difficult. Mr. Prosecutor, my experience ends here. It's my irreversible decision. I have had a 40 year career, dottor Morandi. 40 years of doubts, of uncertainties, of discouragements. How have you overcome them? With the same courage that one needs to sit in judgment of others. We all know it, dottor Morandi. We, that judge, need more courage than those judged by us. I no longer have it. I've started to feel that it is too difficult to administer justice in such an unjust and ruthless society. - I understand. I too had heated moments when I was of your age, when I thought that we should be trying the whole human race. I'm not going that far, you know me... I like things concrete and solid. - So now? Mr Prosecutor... when a crime has taken place and we have caught the guilty party we judge him and we condemn him. But why do we condemn him alone? I know, he is the perpetrator, but are there not others who are also responsible, if only on a moral level? How many other people that we don't know of are also implicated in this homicide? And yet there is only one name... That of the murderer. But nobody is born a murderer as we are born blond or brunette. The man that my investigation will send to trial is not a murderer. This may seem theoretical but, unfortunatelly, I have lived such a story. You have asked in this man's case for all the attenuating circumstances. I was speaking of another case, of another man more innocent than this one... A man I who I saw living as honestly as you and me. One day I saw his tragedy begin and I understand it was meant to happen. You know I was living in his house. I'd like to tell you about it. You will understand better the reason for my resignation. You see... He was the first person I met when I came here. It was one of the last days of the year. I had arrived to take possession of my new post, on the court of a great city, a city I hadn't seen before. A colleague had recommended me to the family of a friend who would rent me a furnished room. I would take meals with them. Bonelli was the name. I knew them to be good people, honest, normal. Hello, is Mr. Bonelli in? - I'm sorry, who are you? I'm dottor Morandi. - The judge! Come in! Thank you, madame. Please, don't look at me. I'm mortified to be receiving you dressed like this. We weren't expecting you so late. Please, make yourself at home. Luigi!... The judge is here. We didn't think you'd be coming today. This is my husband. We were waiting you this morning at eleven... Can I get you something? - Thank you, madame. Probably he hasn't eaten and it's 2... - Don't put yourself out. It's my fault for arriving at such a time. I'll prepare something at once. Have a seat, please. Carla! This is my daughter. Prepare the table and call Luciano. He's my other child. Luciano! This is my son, judge. - Hello. - Hello. Help me lay the table. - I can't. I have to drop off an article at the paper. - He's a real journalist. He doesn't sign yet, but yesterday he had an article published in "La voce". A few lines, but it had everything. How was it titled? Yes: "Cribs in a colleague's house". Everyone reads the news first. - What do you want to do? Special correspondent, round the world. - Go and buy the fruit. I can't, I'll get them to deliver it. Goodbye! - Goodbye. It's a nice family you have. - Carla, Carla are you ready? You'll soon discover they don't give you much peace. What do you do, Mr Bonelli? - Insurance, life and accidents. I try to convince people that life has a value. Carla, this tablecloth is dirty. Use the good one! It doesn't matter, madam. You'll you'll feel comfortable here. We don't do this for the money, but for the company. And after all, you are a paying guest. Did your friend mention that the hot water is extra? - Yes. These days, it's necessary to put in a little extra. My husband is... - A man who enjoys the quiet life. There's nothing to be done, you see? He was born... To be an employee! Does this make me a crook? If only it did!... - Emilia! The judge... He well knows that today's world is made for crooks. Otherwise the judge would have found another profession. I'm an employee too. - Do you get a fixed monthly salary? - Yes. Oh, my God! Always the same amount every month, never an unexpected result! - These ideas Emilia has that would add to our lives a touch of the fantastic. The first of the month he gives me his the salar and, I divide the money and put it in envelopes, each one numbered for a day of the month. Tell the whole story, while you're at it. - I divide the money with my eyes closed, not in equal parts! So in one envelope there may be 10,000 lire, in another 500. In the morning when we get up, we rush to the dresser to discover how much there is for that day. One day may be rich, one day may be poor. When we're rich, we go to the theatre, the coffeeshop... And the next day there's no smoking, nor eating fruit. What's today, madame? - Today we're rich, rest assured! I see, thanks. Have you been involved in many trials? - Yes. - How many, 200? 300? I don't know, probably more. - Then... 500? Yes, maybe 500. If you answer all her questions, it's the path to a nervous breakdown. You also have trials behind closed doors? - Yes. Why are some behind closed doors? In winter, because of the draught... - O, you're making fun of me! This is a nice family, I told myself. And I thought I'll be fine amongst such cheerful people, so decent, so normal. They had the quality I most like to find in people: normality. A few days later something happened in the life of Luigi Bonelli, something difficult to find in the minutes a trial and yet the sort of thing that may, however, condition a man's life. Best wishes to everyone, boys! - Happy New Year! Mr. Bonelli. - What is it? - It's for you, from Human Resources. What does this mean? - I told you, it's from Human Resourcesl. Sign here. - No, I'm not signing. And I don't accept this letter. - What? - I don't accept it! Return it to whoever gave it to you and tell them I don't accept it. They could have let him end the year without worries. But why blame him? He's the messenger, not the head of Human Resources. You can say nice things because it's not you, it's me being fired! But how do you know what it is? It's not inevitable! The letters you delivered yesterday and today, what were they? What did they contain? Were they promotions to CEO? Alright, but what do I tell them? - That I'm staying put. That I haven't even read this letter and I'm not moving. Luigi, don't be so childish! What's this going to achieve? Does this seem fair to you, really? I'm the oldest one here. I'm a father of two. - Children don't count to them. At the end of the month, they count the insurance you've sold! Nothing this month, last month two. Since you've been here, it's only been ten in total! You even let slip that business with the cars of Credito Marittimo. - It wasn't my fault. They said they didn't want to insure them. So how come another company sealed the deal? Because that company had an agent quicker than you. Half of the premium that was due to him he put in a bribe and gave it to the administrator of Credito Marittimo. The administrator of course signed the insurance. You see how it's done? - I don't want to do such things. I have a wife and children who may go hungry, but I won't do things like that, I have always been honest. I've always been upstanding. - Then be upstanding. Happy New Year everyone! Luigi, when are you going to wake up? Bye. Happy New Year! Happy New Year! So, what are you going to do? Sign? Don't insist!... What are you saying?!... Who is that girl who calls up at night? She's Luciano's new girlfriend. The last month's one got bored one day in advance. This is the one for January. He's a highly organised lad, he has 12 girlfriends a year. One per month. Peaceful, punctual with deadlines. - He's an enterprising boy. Do you have a girlfriend? - Carla! Or is this another official secret? I consider them trials behind closed doors. What's the matter with you? - Nothing, nothing... Has something happened? - Nothing's happened. I'm just a little worn out. - Ssh! Let's hear what he's saying! He's at the end of the call. He's calling her "potato", what a dolt! "My Love, heaven will help us." "You'll get the annulment." Oh God, she's married! - What? That scared you, eh? That'll teach you to eavesdrop. Moron, always poking your nose in! - Still no sign of my dress. I have a new dress for tonight, all white chiffon and a neckline that's almost audacious. Looks like they won't send it, the dressmaker's is closed bby now. And if so? You're not going to make a drama about the dress! Keep out of it, you're a man and don't undertsand these things. So are you. - Yes, but I am a father. And I know that for a girl, a dress is an important thing. She'll be among rich people who notice this sort of thing. Indeed, the more modest a girl is the better she to look. And then, Pierino will be looking... - Shut up, stupid! Who's this Pierino? - Lucchi's son, the one with the cement. I'm telling you, hang on to that one. - Don't tell her such nonsense! She must like him first, cement or not. It must be the dressmaker! At last, my dress! Yes? What? Yes, I'll get him. It's for you. - For me? Excuse me. Hello? Yes, I understand, I'll come right away. Will you say it again, please? Molo Clavetto. I'm sorry but I have to go. - At this hour? They need me. - The judge is much in demand. Official business. - Or an excuse? There was an assault at the docks. - Damn! You've just arrived and something happens! Have fun. With or without the new dress, you'll be beautiful Good night. - Good night. What are you looking for? - I'm judge Morandi. If you want the commissioner, he's in the bar. - Thanks. Yes, I've finished, but I can't leave. The investigating judge hasn't arrived yet. Must have got lost on the streets. Tell them all to wait for me. Yes, even on the last day of the year! Do you think I'm having fun? He's here, bye. With your permission, I'm Morandi. - Commissioner Pasetti. Sorry, that was my wife. Even commissioners have wives. Please... Mine wants crimes never to occur at the same time as parties. She's so romantic! - What's this all about? An employee here. He's in a bad way. He made it to the hospital, but he's close to death. He's a certain Amilcare Greppi, 47 years old. His office is opposite, number 3. Have you collected the first testimonies? - We're doing it now. The fact happened behind there. You! When I had the photograph taken, I had a mustache. Stabile Serafino. What did you see? - I didn't see anyone fighting. I was unloading the hold at sea. - Go. Pietro Pasetti. You saw nothing? - No. Unloading the hold at sea... - Yes. Go. Your card? - I don't have one, I'm temporary. What did you see? - I'm temporary. What does that matter? You saw something or you didn't? Answer! Well? Are you waiting for a cue? - No. These types even if they saw something wouldn't speak. Let's leave them to the marshal. Do you want to hear someone else? This is the last person to see Amilcare Greppi before the assault. Were you present at the incident? - No, no. I'm sorry I can't help you more. We met on the pier. Amilcare was going home. We greeted each other and he continued on his way. And you noticed nothing? Didn't you hear shouts, noises? I couldn't hear anything. At that precise moment, the sirens for the silos were sounding. Alright, I see. Did you know Greppi well? - I know everyone around here. Was there someone with a motive to attack him? - Absolutely not. Amilcare was a good man, he lived a quiet life. I can't imagine who would want to hurt him. Another one who knows nothing... - Your guess is as good as mine. May I go? You can go. Good night and best wishes. You know him? - Very well. Him and a few others. - What does he do in the port? He's one who always seems to have a pocketful of permits. Goes in, comes out, does business... - What sort of business? Apparently all lawful, but we can never get a clear picture. At the last moment, he always finds some saint in heaven. D'you mean there's someone else who could speak but won'tt? I've been working here for 20 years The port is a tangled web. Anyone who drops the hat, calls Carla. - Okay. It's your turn. - Carla! To me, to me! - Catch! Your mistake, call Carla. - Carla! Your mistake, you dropped the hat. - Your turn. To do what? - Call Carla. Carla! - What's up? I don't know what this is about, they told me to call... And you do what people tell you right away? Dotor Morandi... the others. - One other. - A pleasure. One other. - One other. Dottor Morandi, we're going to a party. Would you like to come too? No, thanks, I'm going to sleep. - What, on the last day of the year? I'm tired and... - You've impressed everyone. Don't make us beg. - Thank you, it wouldn't be right. Please come. What will you do upstairs at mine? Then stay at home by yourself! - Do you sleep under the same roof? Is he your lover? - He's just our guest. Pierino and you? - You're not jealous? Why would I be jealous? - Then bring him along. Let's go! Are you really a magistrate with a toga and a wreath on the head? Is it true you have to be called Your Honour? - Oh no! Are you bored? - No, not at all. Pity, I was thinking of kidnapping you. I want to dance with you! Your Honour can't dance so he's staying with us. Why did you invite him? You promised that you would give 20 dances to me. Long live the new year! Where are you going? - To give best wishes to mamma. Hello, mamma? I wanted to send you best wishes. To you and to papa. Who's here? Pierino? Yes, I said yes! How should I tell you? Let me speak. - Wait. Hello!... Carla? Papa?... What? Listen... I wanted to tell you... .. that I'm very sorry about your dress. Yes. But the dressmaker required me to pay the old account first... .. and I didn't know how to tell you. No, it's not true. I know these are important things. I understand, yes. These things make a girl happy or unhappy. You need another father. - But what are you talking about? I love you! What does it matter if it's last year's dress? It's still the best one here. All the boys are trying to court me. Well... they're trying. I'm sorry I couldn't give you what I most wanted. I have not had any luck in life. I don't mind for myself, but for you, I wanted to be rich for you. Papa, sometimes you're so childish. I have a feeling that the new year is going to be wonderful for you. You will have everything you want. It's always like this, you know? There are gray times but they pass. And then the beautiful times come. - Please, papa! I'm content, I'm a happy girl. Yes... Happy New Year to you too. As the hunt for the assailant continued, interrogating people at the port and checking alibis, an inquest into the private life of Amilcare Greppi revealed that despite being a modest employee his mother, in contrast, was a wealthy woman. Here, these are the eight apartments, all in the name of Filomena Gallini. - How much are they worth? I can only say who the property belongs to. You must be able to say an approximate value. It must be many millions. - They are large apartments. Let's speak frankly. I don't know who gave the beating nor why. Amilcare had eight apartments in his mother's name. They are investigating how he got the money. You could say he bought the walls with money from us, contractors, but we could say that, at least a couple of stairs were bought by you. Therefore it is in our mutual interest to keep our mouths shut. Tell your colleagues that if the truth comes out, we will not be working in the port anymore, neither you or us. Agreed? These are the best you'll find on the market. I have calf, kangaroo, antelope. If the rights are like the lefts... - They are like the lefts. We don't sell shoes that don't match. - I don't need this merchandise. And I have a customer. Madam! - I was looking in the shop window. We can offer special terms. Sorry, it's an item that just doesn't interest me. Good day. - Good day. Can I help you? - Nothing, I'm with him. You'll see, with a few days' practice... - Impossible. I've been accompanying you to see if you have the capability for the job. I can't entrust a sample to you anylonger. I won't steal them! - It's not a question of stealing. You're doing me more harm than good. You're shutting me off the market! That's five shops you've been in this morning: I'm locked out of them. It'll be a month until I can try them again. I can't go back to them before. There are lots of other shops. - If these don't sell my goods, who else will? Nobody? - Then take it. I'm not talentless, whatever you think. If I can't be some freak of a salesman, I surely can do better. I didn't call you, it was you called me looking for work. Understandable... I'm desperate. I hope you like spinach pie. It's the last of the season. - Thank God. What's up, papa? - Nothing, a bit of a headache. Too much smoking. Tomorrow, they'll install the antenna. - What's this, television? I told you about it last month... - And you've bought it? Luigi, don't start. Everyone has a television! - And this matters to me? You still don't understand that I don't care what other people do? All my life the same thing! What's yourconcerned? The others! - Papa, calm down. How can?! Where's the deliveryman? Let him this back! I don't want it! I can't stand it anymore! He's already gone. Let me see. Which retailer is it? - Why do you behave like this? I bought it in installments. It's 15,000 lire a month. Exactly the 15,000 of the judge's room. I'm carrying on like this because it's impossible to move forward. The 15,000 lire from the judge is needed for food. Yes, and for your cigarettes! - I'll stop smoking, okay? Please, Papa! And you too, mamma. - Your father is getting hysterical over a purchase in installments! - Over one thing? Over ten things! There is the installment for the house, then the one for the fridge, for the sewing machine, and the reasoning is always the same... "There are 12, there are 24 installments, you won't even notice it." Certainly I notice it! Add them all up and see! Excuse me, I'm mortified but every now and then he has these crises. It's all my life that's like this, judge, al! Sometimes I feel I'm going crazy. All the time I've known you I've not had any peace because of your pretensions. Yet all the time I was living from my work. I've never reproached you this. No, but you reproached me that I was a peaceful man, without ambition, a lover of tranquility. But you took away the only peace I had in my life: security. At the end of the month the pleasure to receive a fixed salary that could be relied upon. But a very meagre one, true or false? - Yes, it's true. But I was born to be a functionary, they also serve, don't they? I don't have a sense of initiative. I wasn't born for fighting and competing with others. I had to change. She convinced me to leave that post with Edison. It was a decent job, a very important company. And then I had to stomach the liquidation of those fruitless speculations, simply because your brother was involved. Meanwhile, he has become a rich man with his businesses. Fruitless spculations... His children don't have to endure the life ours do. - Fine! I'm the one who was wrong. Is it possible nobody understands? Luigi... that's enough. You're happy with your post now, with your percentages on the insurance. That's enough. - If papa is content, we're all content. It's over now. The spinach is getting cold... Let's eat. We questioned all those who on New Yer's Eve had been in the port. In many cases we checked their alibis. Our suspicions fell on a certain Orlando Di Giovanni, because of a quarrel he'd had with Amilcare Greppi a few days before at the dock gates. You're not eating? - I'm not very hungry. Is something worrying you? Now that you've found work... - No, it's nothing. So, what have you decided? - About what? Do we buy this bed or not? - What do you need with a bed? There's always time, isn't there? - But it's a bargain! And, then, buying the bed first brings good luck. How much? - Not much. - Shut up! I've committed the advance for a house. - Have you already signed? Yes, for one with two rooms. - One would have been enough. One?! What about these here? - Mamma said that it was unfair. You can't take a family of six on your shoulders. We were so many in our house... You know what my mother did to make us get up? There were nine children and she bought eight pairs of shoes. Therefore the last one up was forced to go barefoot. Can I sleep in the middle of your bed? No, no way! You must come with me, I've ordered your arrest. But he's never been in a fight with anyone! He's the kindest boy I know. Sweet, tender... - You say this because you love him. You were to be married, he's one of your own. My father was also one of my own, but he still left us all. In America he has another family, and the one here, my mother and we, five children... Like we never existed. But Orlando when he met me took everything on his shoulders instead of my father. You see, I can tell the difference. I can't allow you to see him until I've finished interrogating him. I'm sorry. Dottor Morandi! How is this investigation going? You, when investigating, are as punctual as a tax collector. I'm curious to see the proof of your capabilities. But then I have entrusted you with a fairly simple case. Perhaps less so than you thought. Because if the case is simple, the surroundings in which it took place are much less so. Hi, are you coming with me to a party? I?!... You've never mentioned it. - I thought of coming to pick you up. We're going to Marina's house, the girl who thought it was funny to call you Your Honour. Excuse me, I don't know your friend. - Excuse me. Ms. Bonelli. - Roncuzzi. I'm going. Good evening. - You have some strange friends. But he's not my friend! Please go to the waiting room. You may not realise, but it's less embarrassing. I was going to be accompanied by my brother but then I thought: 'The judge will take me' So, are you coming? I can't, tonight I'm very busy. I have endless things to do in the office. Please, it's for the usual reason. If you don't come, Pierino will take me. If he bothers you that much, you could go alone. True, but everyone wants it. Mamma wants it, papa is weak in my case and agrees with anything I do. It's not so easy to resist one I'm supposed to be marrying. So, will you come with me? - I'm sorry, I can't. If you should finish soon, you could pass by and collect me. I can do that. - I'll leave the address. So on New Year's Eve you were in that cafe... - Yes. I don't go there every night, but I was definitely there that evening. I remember because it was New Year's Eve. I left some time after nine. Do you know him? - Yes. He has his coffee in our place and sometimes stays for a game. Was he there on New Year's Eve? No. - Perhaps you don't remember, there were lots of people? But I was there! - There weren't lots of people. There was nobody. At noon my father-in-law had died and we closed up immediately. I'm sorry. - You can go. Thank you, madam. I advise that you think about this... Confessing will be an extenuating circumstance. Denial is worse. If I hadn't found the job, we couldn't have married. Her family was even poorer than mine. Continue. So I tried again at the docks where a docker is well paid. But the procedure is a long one. To join the company and getting the card, that is being permanently employed, I had to work occasionally, on the days when the company was short-handed. But joining even the temporary workers was also not easy. There were so many waiting outside the gates... Every day. And the one who did the hiring, it was always him. Everybody feared him. Every morning, if extra hands were needed, he came out in front of the gates and called those he had chosen. And I was never among those selected. Fusco! - What did I tell you? Even he got in! What are you getting at? - Only those who give him a pay-off get the work. Wanna bet the next one called is Bartolini'? Bartolini! Forward! He gave him 20,000 lire. He told me. So to work, you're saying that I should also pay him off? - Absolutely. I'm not giving him a penny! Why should I gave him anything? Lower your voice! If you don't, you'll remain stuck at this gate until Judgment Day. - So why aren't you being called? Because I don't have the money, but I'll pay as soon as I do. When I see this sort of thing, the blood rushes to my head. Were you born yesterday? I'd give him as much as a week's pay. I have kids, I need work. Several months passed as I waited day in, day out, in vain with the others at the gates. Until the time came I couldn't take it any longer. Then I began to whistle. Why don't you rebel, cowards? Exploiter! Swine! Thief! Thief! Then I realised I couldn't carry on like this. I had been engaged for three years to Maria. One day we were sitting right here, in the piazza in front of the court. I understand you, nobody wants to suffer injustice, but, on the other hand, if you don't pay, you don't work. And we'll never get married. - I'd like to poison him! Orlando, it's the same everywhere. Why did I always get the job when I applied for one? Because I was the best? No... Because they liked the way I looked. Within a few days, if I wanted to stay unsullied, I had to leave. We'll never get married. Then despair took hold of me. I found someone who leant me the money. I was to pay back a little each week. At last I would start to work. I wrapped it in a newspaper so the others wouldn't see, but he obviously remembered me. Who told you I took money? - I thought you did. - You're wrong. I talk only with serious people and not with types like you who make scandal outside the gates. First, you insult me and then you want to be my friend? I will take nothing from you. Actually, I'll tell you one thing. Don't let me see you again at the port or I'm calling the police. You get me? - If you call the police, I'll denounce you. For some things you need evidence. You won't find anyone here willing to testify against me. And what if I denounce you anyway! - Who's going to believe a starving man? Scum! Answer my question. Is what Di Giovanni says true? I've already told you that this man is not able to endure an interrogation. But I have to try, I must know the truth. I'm sorry, everyone has his responsabilities. Here, I am the judge. I'm sorry but you must understand... .. this man barely clings to life. I understand. Come in! Dotore, would you do me a favour? - Let's hear. I asked the bank for a loan on the apartment and the expert is going to make the valuation. I don't want my family to know. Can I receive him in your room saying he's a friend of yours? - No problem. Thanks very much. Come in, pleasel. Hello. - Hello. Is this a partition? - I don't know. Who's there? - The judge with a friend. Have you called? Me? - I heard three knocks. - Three knocks? Ah, yes! - You've forgotten the code in this house? One knock, there's mail, two - you're wanted on the phone, three knocks: are we're going out together? I thought it was no longer valid. You invited me, then went out with someone else Shall we make peace? - Do you want to? Very much. Shall we go out together? Why didn't you tell me he was an expert? Aren't I supposed to know? I was doing an innocent favour to help your father. He didn't want you to know. - Papa's selling the house? Don't turn it into some big drama. It's collateral for a loan. I'm not dramatising! - It's not the whole house that's going, just part of it. - You might find me over concerned, but that's because the house is my dowry. Everyone will know there's a hole in it. Nobody will want to marry me. - Come on... A girl like you! You think that's enough? Here in this city, the cakes are served whole, not with a slice missing. Cherry included. The cherry is what the father has in the bank. And how would you be to blame if your father is in difficulty? Do you know what mamma tells me? That there's only one way to help papa: I have to marry a rich man. - That Lucchi, for example. Pierino, or someone else... it's all the same. Here, a nice girl can only set herself up by a good marriage. Can I take your arm? Hi, Carla. - Hi. - Bye, Carla. - Bye. Did you do that for their sake? The good marriage just went by. Pierino... - You use me to make him jealous? I want the others to undertsand that it's you I like. Probably yesterday you wanted me to understand you had a liking for Pierino. How's that? - I saw you kissing him in the car. Me? It was him who kissed me. I didn't know you were observing. - You wouldn't have let yourself be kissed? You make me a little uncomfortable... If you kissed me and Pierino was watching, I wouldn't care. But, then, I guess you aren't go to kiss me... Your Honour is so serious.. Do you want some chestnuts? - No, I don't want any chestnuts. And no balloons either. Carla, hi! How are you? From way back the seafront I said: "That speck is Carla!" I know you too. - Of course. May I tell you something? To be beautiful is fine, but you go too far! By the way, how's your father? I haven't seen him for a while. He's fine. - Give him my best. Bye! I bought a new boat. I returned La Stella, and bought a cutter. If I phone, will you come for a spin? I don't think so. If you change your mind, call me. Goodbye, judge. Bye, Carla. You know him? - My father knows him. He's a friend of your father? - Quite the opposite. Papa doesn't want me to talk to him when I meet him. But you were talking to him! - I don't find him unpleasant. D'you know how many of the girls I know, seeing him, would go... Is Luciano still sleeping? - He was up late last night for the Sunday edition. - Going down? - I'm going shopping. Can you buy me cigarettes? There's not enough money for food and you're thinking of cigarettes? You know I can't do without them. - You should. There was such confidence between us that I was now almost considered one of the family. Generally, I spent the public holidays with them. And that Sunday we decided to go together to the cinema. Are you in trouble with the new girlfriend? - Don't talk nonsense. Then the trouble must be with the an old girlfriend. Is there a girl in the middle? Luisa? - No. Franca? - No! - Elsa? - Leave me alone! Rosanna? Rome. - What does this mean? Rome, the city. I'm considering it. - You want to go away? I want to, but it's too early to say. Coming? Your mother is worried. She wants you to be next to Pierino. - Are you trying to ruin my afternoon? Quiet, please! We'd better leave - Don't you like the film anymore? - No. They're finally leaving... Why don't you marry Pierino? - I don't like him enough. A girl has the right to chose. - Of course, you're right. Will you buy me an ice cream? - Yes. Please, an ice cream. Thank you. You also want that balloon you wouldn't have last time? You never take me seriously. And your ice cream? - I don't like ice cream. It's not true, you like them but are too embarrassed. I have to reproach you for one thing. - What's that? About the right of a girl to chose. It's fair but you're uncertain. - No. I let Pierino hang around me for a reason. Your mother? It's not easy for a girl to talk about these things. If I knew I couldn't have the boy I wanted, then one Pierino is as good as another one. Especially as he's the sort of boy not to be dismissed lightly. If this would help my family, my father... What's the matter? Do you mind telling me about it? Sorry, it's my fault. - No, indeed. You who are older, have more experience, you tell me, encourage me. - What do you mean? - I trust you. But tell me what you think. A girl must not, cannot solve the troubles of her family even if she has the opportunity to do so, right? - Well... The troubles oftenare less than they seem. I found out today that Luciano wants to leave. You heard what it's like that day when they quarrelled? Papa is not cut out for earning lots of money, for having debts. We need another sort of life, more tranquil, even if more modest. Instead, because of mamma's ideas, it's all so different. Why should I sacrifice myself? For my mother's dissatisfaction? While Carla was talking the show ended. Remember, Mr. Prosecutor? You were also there that day at the cinema. And seeing you and your wife I thought I understood that the life of a judge must be like yours: orderly. I thought that I should not let myself be influenced by a seventeen years old year old girl. Seeing you, I thought I understood in that moment that the life of a judge is above all about equilibrium. And a girl like Carla would take away from me that equilibrium. - Are you listening, or thinking about something else? Say something! - These are not things for your age. You're seeing everything out of proportion, you have no problem. Don't you understand that by carrying on like this we'll lose Pierino? I've told you that there is nothing between the judge and me! Then why did you spend the whole day with him? I'm going to tell him to keep out of it! - Keep it down, he'll hear everything! It's better he does hear, since he can't understand anything for himself! Carla, I'm determined to talk to him. - You won't and I'll tell you why. Because you'd be ashamed! - Ah, a mother should be ashamed to wish her daughter's happiness? I'm doing it for your own good! Mamma, happiness can be found anywhere, even with the last man on earth. - Don't you see how your father is reduced? You were there when he made that scene because I'd bought the television. But for your clothes, for your lipstick and your stockings he says nothing. You know why? It's not because of what you say! - It is, indeed. You've understood nothing. Are the problems of the family of no importance to you? It seems right to be selfish, to the point of doing only what suits you? What would you think if I thought like you? If your father thought like you and said: "I don't want to work anymore, I don't like it" like you say now: "I don't like Pierino"? What do you think you can solve by crying? Mamma, please... - You're worried that he won't hear you. Do you want me to lose patience? Very well. - What's "very well"? I'll make the marriage as you want. With Pierino? - Pierino or someone else, it's the same. What do you care? So long as there's some dirty money to put aside! Dirty money, right? There are plenty of people who have their hands dirtied by things but they wash then with money and they return to cleanliness! - No! Money dirties everything, even a mother's feelings! But remember: you'll have nothing more to say to me! Whatever I'll do, you won't be able to scold me again! Speak quietly... - I'll fix my family! I'll fix it! - Keep your voice down! He'll hear you! I've also been starting to count on you. Someone opened my eyes, I can't let you escape anymore. I can't let you escape anymore! Why do I have to go out if I don't want to? - It's not a reception for boys. You'll be bored. - I'll go to the cinema. Can I have the house keys? - No. But when can I have them? - Never. D'you remember, Mr. Prosecutor? You were at that reception too. You had to come because at the Lucchi's were gathered the city's most important people. I knew that the rich need the people that count and the people that count need the rich. But there were two in that house that were not rich, and even less did they count: Luigi Bonelli and his wife. And another one, it was not clear how much he counted among people so different from him, at least in appearance. If the shoe-selling business doesn't work out, come and work with me. Ugo, don't be offended, but the kind of business you're offering is not for me. Luigi, you are honest. Everyone in this world does whatever they want. At least put your honesty to good use. I'm honest too, but you know how it is here... Get caught just once with a batch of smuggled cigarettes and they won't forgive you. You, on the other hand, have a clean slate. You're just what we're looking for. I have to open an office, but I need to bring a friend with me. A friend like you. It would be in your name... what more could you want? I want nothing, I'm content with very little. But my way... - Then we need say no more. I saw Carla the other day, she's become a beautiful girl. Mr. Bonelli, may I speak to you? - Of course. - May I? Please... You must certainly be wondering why I invited you here. I'd heard that you applied for a post with my brother-in-law Baroni. - Yes, madame. I didn't imagine that you... - I heard from my brother-in-law. And I've decided to take the initiative. I've been assured you will be the first to be hired. Madam, I don't know how to thank you. - Don't thank me. In return, I have a favour to ask. I know that between your daughter and my son a... let's say sympathy has developed. Your daughter is a pretty girl and deserves the best husband in the world. But you must also realise our situation. We are fifty families in this city. Maybe it is a mistake, but we have always married only among ourselves. Yes, I have heard this. - Therefore I would like to propose an agreement. Each of us on its own will advise our children not to go on seeing each other. Can I offer you something? Emilia, it's a good job! - Yes, but it's a job as a clerk. Yes. - So hold on to the insurance job you have. It will be better! - How much? - Enough. Then the thing about insurance is there's the insecurity. It can end at any moment. - You can't compromise your daughter's future for 20,000 more lire. You talk about it as if it was a sure thing. Those who talk that way never marry. - You have to give up the job, understood? I promised to call Tuesday. - You won't telephone and you don't give any sign! And in no case will you talk to Carla! Oh! Damn you! Don't worry about my mother. If I can pass at least one exam in February, I'll speak to her again. - And what will you say? That I want to keep seeing you as often as I like! I'm happy like this, with you. - But if she doesn't want it? Actually, I agree with her, it's better we don't see each other anymore. On the contrary, I'll see you tomorrow. - I said no. I don't want to see you. - I get it, it's this judge! Continue! - Don't try to deny it. There's something between you. No... at least I don't think so. You're in love and don't know it. - I swear to you no. Or rather if it's yes, I swear that it's without knowing. And he doesn't know either. - Then, if you don't know, it's better to let it go. - What's it to do with you? You must do this... obey! - Ah, yes? You order me about as well! You've gained some courage with me! With your mother you don't, but with me you do! So, if you're so brave marry me, I assure you I will. - When? - Right now. Not immediately. Listen, Carla, I must pick the right moment. You've seen how my parents are... It's better we wait. - You see I'm right? It's all over. - No, it's not all over! We can continue to see each other secretly from papa and mamma. Listen, understand that for me it all ended three minutes ago. You need to realise I've not heard any of these last things you've said. Because if I had, I'd be struggling hard not to give you a slap! I would like to speak with judge Morandi. You confirm what he says? That to work in the docks, Amilcare Greppi asked you for money? Do you confirm this? So? - Well... Why don't you speak? You all paid him. You, you, and you! - I didn't. How can you not remember that day at the port? You told me you had to pay 20,000 lire. - You're wrong. You must have misunderstood. - But how can you not remember?! You told me: "I have three children, I have to pay him." When did I tell you this? - That day it was raining! It might have rained, but I didn't tell you anything. You realise the responsability you are assuming? If it's proven that Amilcare Greppi demanded money he has all the attenuanting circumstances! But if it isn't proven, then his position becomes very grave. And if Amilcare Greppi dies, it becomes a homicide without attenuantion and without provocation. Judge, there are many people with troubles. Life isn't easy for anybody. We all have families to support. I know that by telling the truth, you endanger your jobs in the docks, but why don't you support him? He's one of your own! You can go. I'm sorry, Carla, but today I can't come with you. But... I just wanted you to accompany me home. So we could talk a little. I have... some things to tell you. - Right now? Yes. - I'm sorry, but I have too much to do. Then... it doesn't matter. I stood watching her as she walked away. I regretted a little having treated her like that. But I was too busy with what was going on. Things so important that I didn't notice other things were about to happen to Carla. Ah, Carla. You see? These are like those from the state monopoly... and they cost a lot less. What's wrong? - Nothing. Is something going on? Nothing's going on. What does "nothing's going on" mean? Papa, what a family we are! I don't understand you. Do you mean me? You... me... all of us. Listen, Carla. I have certainly been a bad husband for your mother. I regret it, but I can live with this. What I couldn't tolerate is having been a bad father. Most of all, to you. It's different with Luciano, he's a man now. I've seen how you've looked at me these last few days. What is it? What have I done? Do you know why Luciano wants to go to work in Rome? No. - The other morning when you entered his room ...and you thought he was asleep... he wasn't asleep. So? - You're asking me? What did you take? It was for milk. I swear! Papa, don't swear! It was for cigarettes. I don't want to say these things, but there's more. It's everything else, how we live... what we have become. But what are you saying... Carla. You're a girl. - Papa, you don't know what it means to be a girl! Hello, Ugo available? A friend of his. Hello? Ugo? It's Bonelli. Luigi. Is that job you mentioned still available? Can I see you tomorrow? At any time. All right. I don't understand the deal. - I'll explain it to you now. What's your cargo for the next trip? - Bananas. And the cargo is insured? - Of course, I always have insurance. Here's how it'll work if you're insured with us... We'll pay you the same price as the other companies. Now tell me something: on these other trips, do you carry only bananas? That's what they require me to do! - This is exactly what I'm talking about. And have you ever found anyone who will insure the rest? Are you kidding? Who'll insure that? - I! This is the difference! I'll insure the contraband. If you land the cigarettes without anything happening and the goods reach their destination you know that with me you will receive somewhat less because you'll have paid my premium. But if Customs turn up and seize it all? I'll still pay you the full value of the load. For you, it'll be as if you landed the goods at their destination. We make a policy on the regular load. You pay the amount to the manager and he signs the receipt. He does it all. The rest is all verbal. And how much do I pay for this insurance premium? 15% of the cargo. - 15%? - The risk doesn't count? I'm wearing heels, I can't keep up! - We're there. Where are you taking me? - Come, come. Here, you see? - Yes. - Don't get it? - No, papa. Here you go have it.. my chair! And this... is my desk! These are my stamps! Read it. Read what it says. "The director"... - Under it, under it! Read underneath! "Luigi Bonelli, the director". - But... It's my stamp! The director, the director! That's me, you see? - Have you found a new job? - Yes! A job as director! And I haven't told you the pay because if I did your head would spin like that chair. How did you find this job? What do you do? Insurance. A new company directed by me. So I am the director. And these bells are for employees who'll be behind there. I ring and they come running. Well? Aren't you going to congratulate me! Aren't you happy? You changed your father! You are no longer the daughter of a functionary who couldn't even afford his own cigarettes. You can tell your brother that I have no need to steal his money! - Papa, what's come over you? And when you go home you can tell your mother as well. Tell her she has a new husband! His name is also Luigi Bonelli, but he's a new man! - What's wrong with you, papa?! A new man, be clear! Nothing like that anonymous and despised man who was content with everything. Papa, we have always loved you, even if we sometimes had to struggle. - Even better! Now you'll love me even more. I've woken up, you see? I've woken up. I knew that sooner or later I would find a job that's right for me. That I would eventually find someone who gave me a chance. You'll see Carla, you'll see at last what kind of a man I am. I'm no longer incapable, a weakling and a failure. You'll see that I can do as well as all the others, maybe better! Oh, papa... what's going on? What is this job? - Carla... What's the matter with you, Carla? Luigi! Are you now making girls cry? Ah, it's your daughter. Hi, Carla. I thought for a moment that your father had reawakened the instincts of a Don Juan. Even Ugo is interested in this insurance. We have formed a company. You know, business is best done among friends. Wouldn't you agree, Carla? Yes, but... Was this company active for long? No, it's new. Why don't we also take Carla on? She could work as a secretary. No, Ugo, not Carla. Goodbye. I'm going, papa. - I'll come with you. No, Luigi, you must stay here. People will soon be coming for their insurance policies. I'll go with her. - It doesn't matter. She's not a child, she can go alone. I have the car outside. I can take her. Alright. Bye, papa. See you at home. Bye Luigi, see you tomorrow. I realize this evening that I am an enviable man. New sailboat, new car and now... a new girl. Meaning me? - Yes, meaning you. Whoever sees me here with you can only envy me. Don't forget that it's only because I want to know from you... Let's not talk of such mundane matters. The important thing is to be together and enjoy the evening. You know, Carla, sometimes my luck astonishes me. Why? - Every time I want something, I get it. What did you want this time? - For long I've been wainged to take you to dinner. And it happened. - Very convenient. Will you tell me how to do it? My wishes never come true. It's easy. All you have to do is want the same things I want. Want to try? - I don't much care to, but... Wish for a kiss! - I don't want... - Saying no is useless! I know this will happen too. - Oh yes? So there's no need to rush, we can wait for it to happen. You'll see what will happen. And sooner than you think. I imagine that this is your idea of pleasant conversation, but what I want to know about is my father. - He's worked for me for just a few days... What more can I tell you? - I need to know what he does. Insurance, a job like any other. With the difference that he's being paid by me, a friend. Happy now? I don't understand my father's work because I don't understand you! You are always on the edge. One moment seemingly honest, pleasant and the next quite the opposite. Are you doing that on purpose? - You marvel because I'm a man. I behave like a man, you're used to boys. I wonder at how many are after you! - I don't like boys. Boys don't have much courage. - You've quickly learnt this. Neither do some men have much courage. They don't have it nor do boys, nor those of a certain age. What an experience! You say that you're in partnership with Ugo, that you'll make a lot of money, that you trust him. So, what more do you want? It's not a reason why Carla should stay out with him until this hour! - But it's not yet midnight. Perhaps Carla wanted to go to the cinema. He said he would bring her straight home. I don't like this. Not at all! Where are you going? - Downstairs to wait. I want to tell Ugo loud and clear. Be careful, don't lose the friendship of Ugo as well. I know what to do, also with Carla. What have you managed with Pierino Lucchi? From now on, since I make the money I'm giving the orders! Especially when it comes to my daughter. What do you want, Luciano'? Why aren't you asleep? I'm not sleepy. Where's papa going? He's going downstairs. - Carla hasn't returned? Not yet, she'll return soon. She went to the cinema with Ugo. Once, papa didn't even want to hear any mention of Ugo! He disliked him. - Why are you saying this? Because I'm wondering why he allowed Carla to go out with him. - Don't talk nonsense. Ugo is a decent person, a good man. Go to sleep. I'll take care of your sister. Imagine what a boy has to worry about!... Good night. Good night Carla, you go up. - Good night, Ugo. Hi, Luigi. Why are you here? Listen Ugo, we are friends. Don't make me act the role of the father with you. Carla is a girl. - We went to eat a pizza. It's not because of you I'm speaking. You know, as long as she was going out with boys it didn't bother me. But when people see her out with a man, what are they going to think? Alright, Luigi, good night. Ugo! I haven't offended you? - No, no. You hadn't told me that the apartment already had another mortgage. - Otherwise we would have replied... that our bank doesn't grant second mortgages. But I have a deadline of a million on the 14th. I had a lot of debts, all small. So I thought it better to have them all in one, even if it's large. So I signed a promissory note for a million... and I paid everything, so I could return with your mortgage. But now... what will I do if you won't give me the loan? I'm sorry, it's not possible. - But I have a good job as a manager and if my promissory note is protested I'll lose it. Couldn't you help me? And you, aren't you saying anything? - What can I say? We are functionaries, the money isn't ours. Why didn't you come? I've been waiting for you all day. Are you crazy! I told you that I wouldn't come to your house. And I never will, understood? Go away! - Are you going out with me tonight? You know it's not possible. I'll ask your father about it. - Don't even try. I see you don't know my father. Good evening, judge. - Good evening. We've been meeting a lot lately. If I was you, I wouldn't say this. - Why? Are you forgetting the circumstances we met in. I know who you are. - So? And I also know these are good people. Leave that girl alone. - Jealous? May I? Hi, Ugo. - Hi, Luigi. - Good evening, judge. I fixed that thing. - Good night. - Good night. You give me the bank's notice, and I'll the promissory note. This way you can sleep in peace. You'll pay me back later. - But how did you do it? I told you about it, but I wasn't expecting this. What sort of a friend would I be then? - Ugo, will you stay for dinner with us? Gladly. He died an hour ago. I want to rent this place for the summer. You can come whenever you want. Do you love me, Ugo'? And you? I don't know what love is. When I met you, I wanted to make you believe I was someone who knows. But I was just a little girl. Then between me and love, you got in the way. I don't understand anything any more. Ugo... why are we lovers? - What questions. Because we feel well together. I like it, you like it. We can do it secretly, nobody can stop us. Have your friends gone? I'd hate it if they knew I was here. They're leaving now. In a few minutes you can go. How I've changed! A year ago, all this would have horrified me. Why pretend? It still horrifies you. D'you think that if papa knew we were meeting like this he'd kill me? Shall I buy you a book for the journey? - Thanks papa, I have the papers. Please Luciano, write as soon as you get there. Don't forget us. - But I'll always be thinking of you, papa. All aboard! Bye, mamma. - Bye, Luciano. - Bye, papa. Won't you give me a kiss? - Of course. Best wishes. - Good luck. Write. And I'm sorry if there was sometimes between us... Goodbye, judge. I'm happy to have known you. Me too, Luciano. Good luck. And since you're one of us now... will you keep an eye on my family? They are all so messed up. Bye, Carletta. - Lucky you, to be leaving. Carla, if there's anything wrong, write to me! I asked you for a coffee because I don't feel like I could bear to go home with them. I have become selfish but I still don't like seeing people suffer. How you've changed! The Carla of the past spoke differently. Of dances, of Pierino... - Yes, Andrea, I've changed greatly. Remember when I insisted that you accompanied me to the dance? After all, only a couple of months have gone by. It seems like so long ago. I'm afraid I'll regret it. You really believe that? - I think so. It depends on you, Carla, you're still young. You can do whatever you want with your life! No, Andrea, nobody can do what they want with their life. What's happened to you? I should reproach you for these things you say. You may not reproach me! Only a few days ago you were upset about the death of that port employee. - I was thinking of the other one, of Orlando. He was suddenly turned into a killer and he'd been such a good boy. They had exasperated him, pushed him to rebel. You see? We're all the same. It's not for finding excuses for myself, but it seems to me like we're all in a row, everyone is in one. A long line of people, the first that pushes makes the others fall. You've noticed that I've changed, but I've become what others wanted! Which others? - Everybody I've met in my life. From the first to the last. From my father to Pierino... .. from my mother to Ugo. Perhaps you too. Carla, you must find a solution in yourself. Not just in myself, but in others. I could have been the wife of Pierino Lucchi. Or your wife, Andrea. Or I could have been the daughter of a man different to my father. In every case, I wouldn't be what I am now. Do you never think of these things when you judge people in court? We need to talk... - One moment. Customs are in the office, they want to see the original of every policy. What do we do? - Don't tell them you've seen me. My coat. I have to go, I'll be back later. - Goodbye. Who is it? - It's Luigi, open up! I can't right now. What do you want? - Open the door! The Customs are in the office. They want to check all the policies. What should we do? Stay calm, go ahead and let them see the records. What do I say if they start asking questions? - I have people here. I can't let you in. Do what I told you. Try to be natural, I'll be there quickly. How long will you be? - Within 5 minutes. Listen Ugo, I can't go there alone. I'm scared. - Then go to the devil! - Ugo! I'm coming. - I could wait here. No, no you won't. - What's up with you? Nothing. Luigi, go home. I'll see them. And don't worry. Go! I'll phone you later. I need to use the telephone. - As you wish. Hello? Emilia? It's me. Carla is at home, isn't she? I see. Did she go out recently? It doesn't matter. No, nothing. A coffee, please. - Coming right up. So you knew all about it! Maybe you even encouraged it. Carla is a grown-up now. She's a woman. She knows very well what she's doing. But with a married man? - A married man! Ugo separated from his wife a long time ago. Perhaps he'll get an annulment and marry Carla. Let's not be hypocrites on this point. You don't even believe what you're saying! - Ugo is not to be thrown away. He has many qualities: he's nice, still young, rich... I'm looking out for Carla. - Not like this! Luigi, I don't want to appear to be a monster, but... is it possible that for you everything is a tragedy? To other families worse things happen! What do I care about other families? I care about mine! Papa... mamma... I beg you, don't torture yourselves, what good is it? Everything has gone wrong, it's true. Listen well, Carla... No, papa, please. I want to sleep. I'm tired of it all. Don't you want some dinner? - No, I just want to sleep. I don't want to listen to anything. Good night, mamma. Good night, papa. I'll make dinner. What are you doing? Are you leaving? Didn't your wife tell you anything? No... Don't be upset. You wife has given me to understand that you're working and she doesn't need the rent anymore. She says it's for reasons of decorum. Judge... I've been wanting to to talk to you for some time... to ask for an advice. Yes, but not now. I'm sorry, I'm going to be working all night. I have to finish the investigation into the case in the docks and deliver it tomorrow. I just have time to move into the new house and get to work. You can come and see me at the court tomorrow, whenever you want. We'll be able to speak undisturbed. This investigation is very much on my mind. I understand. - Goodbye. When I arrived the following morning, the porter gave me a postcard. The last sign of their life that had disappeared were these lines from Luciano with greetings from Rome. I understand you, dottor Morandi. The drama you've lived... - So close! Seeing it, even foreseeing it... and without being able to do anything except wait for it to happen. I understand. Your crisis is explicable. I realise your state of mind, but... in our profession, I'm telling you again, one needs courage. I'll put your resignation here. Think about it for twenty-four more hours. Perhaps... - No! I don't know anymore if I'm wrong or the laws are wrong. The laws are just. Maybe they should be less just. Had Bonelli survived, his family, today, I would have served it a file quite like this one. I would have written on the front page as I wrote for Orlando: "Refer to trial for homicide." Yet he lived quietly in his row. Someone pushed and the row fell. We do not condemn all of those who are behind a man's crime. How is it possible to administer justice in an unjust world? I told you, you're like me when I wanted to prosecute the whole human race. Remember, dottor Morandi... true guilt exists as well. Not only the innocent are guilty. And if we all quit who would defend the Luigis of this earth? Those like you, Mr. Prosecutor. If I'm weak, I don't serve justice. Goodbye. - No, wait a moment. I'm only asking you this: keep it for twenty-four hours. You can bring it back tomorrow. Goodbye. Judge, excuse me! I must ask you something. - I can't, I... Please, listen to me. I have to ask you for something. Help me. I want to marry Orlando, in prison. But you know that... - I know. I've requested his indictment for homicide. - I know. Who knows when he will be freed from prison! He'll be an old man. Do you understand? - I love him. I'll wait for him, I can't let go of him. I can't abandon him all alone because life is unjust. We swore that we would walk life's path together. I would be ashamed to be in the world if I lacked the courage. He must know that he is not alone. Very well, Maria. Prepare for tomorrow an additional instruction in the case of Orlando Di Giovanni and recall the workers from the port. - THE END -
