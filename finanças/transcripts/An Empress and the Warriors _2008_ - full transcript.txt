Brother xuehu your highness we're alone here. There's no need for formalities my father, our king, once said to me these swords are the reason for our greatness the kingdom of yan was born from the blood of great yan warriors the battle tomorrow... Will you promise to watch over my father? The first time I fought at your father's side, I was just a boy thousands of men lost their lives that day it was your father's sheer determination, his bravery... That led us to victory and saved our kingdom he was like a god on the battlefield do you really need to worry about a man like that? Your majesty, the enemy approaches! Doctor... Your highness... Can I pass a message to your family? My son... he's only five... I'll tell him his father was the bravest warrior I've ever seen Attack! Charge! Your majesty... What happened? I don't know the king is injured! Your majesty... Help the king inside! Hurry! Your majesty... Your highness, you are needed in the king's quarters! Doctors, how is my king‚Äù? His condition is very serious any sudden movement could put his life at risk say no more lord hu, the battlefront needs immediate attention perhaps my lord should lead the counterattack? I've decided to relinquish my command to... Muyong xuehu my king defeat the zhao army for me yes, sire! Go... counterattack immediately! Yes, sire... Xuehu my king my king please. Don't try to speak. Rest assured, my king we will win this battle! I know, xuehu... You've faced stronger foes before and triumphed it's the hidden enemies that I worry about... The ones you don't see coming my king, I will not fail you go now gol! How is my father? Your highness his majesty is badly injured. You must go to him what should we do? We have to fight back now. Take good care of his majesty Father feiler when xuehu returns, give my swallow sword to him he will take care of the great kingdom of yan... And you but you'll be fine Move in! Retreat! What do you want? How could you not make me the commander? Do you know how many men you've lost? They're soldiers. They expect to die! They're soldiers, but also husbands and fathers they willingly risk their lives so their children may live in peace they should not be made to suffer for our personal ambitions! Then you should not entrust our fate to a bastard orphan he may be an orphan, but the people of yan are his family and this country is his home! But I am your nephew we are of the same blood yet everything you do... Each battle you fight serves only your own ambitions! You're wrong about me I've done everything for the great kingdom of yan I alone can make this kingdom strong not in the name of ambition but glory Father! My king... Before leaving for battle, his majesty left clear instructions that should he die... He is to be succeeded by muyong xuehu Minister teng, is this some kind of joke or is my hearing worse than I thought? How can we allow an orphaned bastard to rule the great yan? Diao erbao! You will speak with respect! Is that a threat? Who's afraid of an administrator like you? There will be no fighting in the hall of swords! Diao erbao, do you intend to disobey his majesty's will? If that was truly his majesty's last wish, no one would dare to disobey but judging from what I can gather, we have only your word to go on lord hu, are you questioning my integrity? We will obey his majesty's commands. Not yours! Before his death, his majesty entrusted his swallow sword to me he instructed me to... Your servant understands! His majesty wished to appoint the Princess as his successor! Muyong and the soldiers of yan pledge loyalty to your highness until our dying breath! My Princess loves her people as the rightful holder of the swallow sword, she will unite us all! But the successor must be male! Her highness was entrusted with his majesty's sword! Who knows if his majesty was in his right mind... Disrespect his majesty again, and you will die! Generals! Your swords are for the enemy, not each other! The great yan was born on the battlefield each king was a supreme warrior my Princess is beautiful but perhaps too delicate can she really be expected to lead an army and defend our land? I may not yet be up to the task of commanding an army... But the blood of kings roars through my veins! I will not disappoint my ancestors, my country or my people! From this day forth, I will undergo military training I pledge to behead the next enemy who dares to invade yan with my own hands! Teng bochang yes, your highness until my training is complete, all affairs of the state are under your command anyone who disobeys shall be executed! As your highness commands! My lord, can the Princess really be an effective leader? The idea of a female ruler is ridiculous! I won't let her destroy the honor of the great yan! Why didn't you tell the truth? My father anointed you his successor do you really think the army will follow me into battle? I appreciate my king's wishes but you are the only one who can unite us and bring peace to the region I wish my father were still alive... Don't be afraid do you promise to stay by my side? I promise to turn you into a proper yan warrior I didn't know the Princess could fight so well Your highness... Come on! Attack! Get up! Remember this... A yan warrior will choose death before accepting defeat! Get up! Brother xuehu, are you really leaving for army camp tomorrow? Yes! I must follow my king's example and become a brave warrior. When I grow up, I will protect you and the great yan brother xuehu is good to feier and feier loves you this stone carries good luck and will protect you until your return Why are you still tending the horses? Finish quickly and get some rest! Sir... There is something I need to say it's for the person I've been calling brother xuehu when I was little, he used to take me riding, hunting and fishing those were the happiest days of my life lately, he's had to scold and even punish me but I know that, despite his rough exterior, he cares about me everything he does is for my benefit I want him to know that I won't disappoint him Weak arms slow arrows! Practice it again 1,000 times! I want the Princess to disappear when she misses her coronation, all the blame will fall on muyong. The Princess has disappeared while under muyong's watch. He must be punished! This is no time to point fingers I agree with minister teng perhaps muyong had no part in this we mustn't jump to conclusions perhaps her highness knew the military would never follow her orders perhaps she staged her own disappearance Once general muyong locates her highness, the truth will be revealed! Your highness... My lady! Calm down! I'm here to help. Who are you? A doctor... you were struck by a poison dart where am I? This is my home you are safe here I must get back! My lady! You should be resting right now. You haven't fully recovered from the poison they'll be looking for me. I have to go my lady... I told you, you haven't fully recovered yet. One more word from you and I'll hand you over to your enemies You need to take this medicine for 3 days You can leave as soon as you've recovered What's your name? Duan lanquan I'm yan feier thank you Your highness... Your highness... Your highness... Yan feier! Come, I'll change your bandages no! The dressing needs changing once a day otherwise you'll begin to itch I said no! If I wanted to take advantage of you, I would have done it last night say no more! I'll change the dressing myself Hurry! It itches... Hurry! Don't look! How can I do it without looking? Just don't look too closely! Hurry! Close your eyes. Look away! How can I change the dressing with my eyes closed? Just close your eyes! Don't move! What are you doing? Hush! I'm trying to be quick... Turn the other way! I forbid you to look! Close your eyes! There! It's done! Are you certain she was hit with a poison dart? Yes! Go to the valley and await further instructions not long ago... Her highness made a pledge inside the hall of swords she vowed to complete her training before taking the throne but now, she has deserted her post in the army the Princess has abdicated! That is a groundless accusation! If yan feier cannot fulfill her promise, our country will need a new ruler Duan lanquan... Duan lanquan... Eat what you can Yuck! This is terrible yan feier... How was breakfast? Excellent. But I' m not very hungry... Thanks anyway I just made something that might interest you it's called, "no need for a good man" it's for you "no need for a good man"? What is it? Use it to scratch your back if it feels itchy, you won't need my help hey! Where are you going? I have to pay the queen a visit the queen? Care to join me? Ahhhh. You were referring to a queen bee yes, this rare species of bees produces honey with miraculous healing properties they don't normally bite. Not unless they're scared When this honey is added to my remedy, the medicine will be twice as effective taken on its own, it can also improve your complexion here... try some It's delicious! Can I pick some? Sure but move gently and slowly Watch out! Don't panic! Slow down! I'm coming put on my hat run! Try some alright What do you think? Delicious you should leave the army and become a cook I'm not a good cook it's just that you're a bad cook it doesn't matter if I cook badly I only have one mouth to feed don't you have a family? They're all dead mine too Are you from the south? We all eat, sleep and breathe the same air everyone is part of the same large family family? This family has been at war ever since I can remember we've never had more than a few days of peace then why did you join the army? When the country is in crisis, every man... And woman must do their part the country is not in crisis; The country is sick what do you mean? I have no medicine for the sickness where the strong bully the weak in endless warfare it's civilians who suffer the most so your solution is to live alone, away from everyone else? War... Never brings peace. It only brings suffering You should sleep now the more you rest, the sooner you will heal The new moon sword? Does this mean there are survivors? The ten kingdoms eradicated the new moon warriors 10 years ago! What are we making? What is all this cloth for? When you've finished sewing, our mission will be accomplished what am I making? Why won't you tell me? It's meant to be a zhuge lantern! A zhuge lantern? This big? It has to be big enough to fly a man into the sky you're dreaming! Men need to first dream before dreams can come true! Dreams can come true? This lantern needs lots of hot air to fly into the sky but I've discovered a substance in the mobei desert it can be refined into a powerful powder when the time comes, just ignite it and... Boom! Up you go! If you're so high up, what happens if you fall? I've never thought about that But just imagine... Crystal blue skies and puffy white clouds all at your fingertips! Reach out your hand out and literally touch the heavens you could live up to your namesake, yan feiler a swallow flying free in the sky... Wouldn't that be amazing? When can we try it? It's not done I'm afraid there isn't time why not? Your wound is almost healed you can leave tomorrow oh, yes... I must return as soon as possible you want to see something really beautiful? What is it? Follow me. It's up here... Is this a paradise? This is what life can be... Without the horrors of war look... Oh, he's adorable! The young... the weak... All god's creatures deserve a chance to live Remember to change your bandages daily there's a container of honey inside remember to take it in the morning and evening if your wound itches, use "no need for a good man" there's also a map inside so that you won't get lost thank you. I will always remember your kindness. The more you rest, the sooner you'll heal... Now go to bed! Hey! Are you asleep? I was... Until you started making so much noise what's the matter? I can't sleep I'm too excited about going home tomorrow and you? The last few days have been exhausting I can't wait to return to my quiet life as soon as you leave tomorrow go to sleep now the more you rest, the sooner you will heal... You've been saying that all day long Yan feier! Shall I see you off? Head straight along the river you'll recognize the way home promise me something finish your lantern and fly to see me in yan It's my men! Brother xuehu! Long live your highness... Forgive your servant for his late arrival please rise brother xuehu, meet doctor duan. He saved my life thank youl! My Princess, we must hurry yes prepare a horse for the Princess! Yes, sir! I didn't hide my identity on purpose your highness, I'd love to help but I'd rather be the feier that you know... A swallow that flies free in the sky You should go now remember to keep your promise I can't make promises just to fly... Is already too much for one man to hope for take care Perhaps we should rest awhile no. Let's keep pushing forward Sir... your highness! What happened? The zhao army has launched an attack! Our troops fought back, but we suffered considerable losses let's ride! The Princess has returned! The Princess is back... Her highness has returned... Hu ba refused to mobilize his troops unless I handed over the swallow sword and gave up the throne I refused to bow down and took command of the remaining troops this is outrageous! How do we stand? The zhao army has 10,000 men we have 2,000 with those numbers... The longer the battle lasts the greater our disadvantage we must also consider hu ba and his men what shall we do? Let the enemy quietly know her highness will lead the troops when the zhao forces try and capture her highness, we will be waiting to ambush them but this would put the Princess in grave danger! I vowed in the hall of swords to defend yan against any invaders tomorrow, I will lead the men! Protect her highness with your lives! Retreat at the first sign of danger! Yes, sir... My king father, I hear Princess feier is in command of the yan army! Why isn't muyong xuehu leading them? They're fighting amongst themselves by sunset, zhao shall rule everything under the heavens! Today, we fight with... Strength and courage we fight to the death! Long live her highness... The man who captures the yan Princess shall receive a thousand pieces of gold! Be sure zhao wu follows you into the woods do not worry archers! Ready... Infantry! Stand by... Go! Don't let them outflank us! All of you, head to the woods. Hurry! The Princess is there! Capture her! Protect her highness! Protect my king! Attack! Nol your highness! You must kill him! Father! If you must take a life, take mine! Let me pay the price for invading yan but spare my father go away! Father... Come on! End it! Do it quickly! The future king of zhao shall avenge my death! I can kill you, but can I kill every man in zhao? Our kingdoms have been at war for years thousands of lives have been lost your father king, my father king... So many of our beloved ancestors... Thousands of soldiers... And what have they died for? Vengeance! Vengeance? Is there a reason now for hatred between your son and myself? Our kingdoms should no longer be at war you may leave with your father stand down! Let's go Your majesty your majesty, what do we do now? Retreat... Retreat... Long live her highness... Long live her highness... Long live her highness... By royal decree... Diao erbao and the other twelve officers have been found guilty of deserting their posts and defying orders they are to be stripped of their titles and demoted three ranks hu ba, who abused his role as yan's commander-in-chief, has been found guilty of conspiracy and treason his crimes cannot be pardoned he is to be stripped of his title and powers and banished forever from the hall of swords! This is just one battle our war remains unfinished... My lord, I've concocted a most deadly poison for which there is no antidote if your poison had worked the first time, my lord would already be king! No antidote? None do you know the formula? Yes, my lord. Yes I do! Start making a large amount A flood in taiyue mountain has destroyed many villages the refugees are hungry... Perhaps we should send troops immediately should we send relief? Your highness your highness Your highness your highness! Should we send relief? Yes. Send food and water immediately general muyong, take charge of the deployment minister, are there further matters to discuss? Your coronation will take place the day after tomorrow regarding the arrangements... Our troops have suffered tremendous casualties. Our people are hungry now is not the time for grand ceremonies keep it simple Yes, your highness thank you all for your part in a great yan victory dismiss It's like old times. No matter where I hide... You know how to find me I know this is a beautiful view, where one can think clearly and freely when I was little, I only thought how high these palace walls seemed I never once thought about what might be on the other side now that you've seen beyond these walls... I know there's another way of looking at things nothing is the same once you've seen it from high above is it crazy to think a man can fly? I have no idea why I believe everything that fool says he's not a fool he's a new moon warrior new moon warrior? My father mentioned the name once it's a forbidden topic for yan and the other nine kingdoms it's a past we'd all like to forget they were the most feared warriors in all the lands they never lost a single battle the ten kingdoms felt threatened... Every new moon warrior, be it man woman or child, was killed He alone survived... It may be a chance for him and me being together officials and generals, by this decree, yan feier has abdicated muyong xuehu And teng bochang shall rule the yan together your highness... From this day, yan feier will no longer interfere in the affairs of state! God bless my country! Brother xuehu... You are the daughter of a great warrior king it is your duty, your honour, to follow in his footsteps my father wanted you to have the swallow sword he chose you. Not me this is your homeland! How can you turn your back on your people? If my country needs me, I am prepared to die for it so there's nothing in yan that would keep you from leaving? There is... And it will always have a place in my heart Goodbye, brother xuehu feierl take care! Duan lanquan feier take me with you! I want to fly! Hurry! I'll throw you a rope! Here, grab it! Climb higher, quick! Wait for me! Untie the rope and turn the plank this way! Hurry!

It's up to you the lie is, I missed you and... I was going to fly in search of you and the truth? The truth is, I was coming to find you so that we could take the first flight together Feier don't catch cold General! I've just received word that hu ba mobilized his troops and left the royal city that traitor! Hu ba plans to lay siege to the city! If civil war erupts, the kingdom of yan will be ruined! Her highness has abdicated! We must maintain stability! Look! I found one! This lingzhi is a rare medicinal plant it's not common to find them in these parts let's separate and see who collects the most I'll go this way! Alright So, a friend from afar has come to visit you can bury this sword but not your past new moon warrior I'm just an ordinary man make the first move! Why must you force my hand? If you're afraid to fight, you do not deserve feier! I'm done with killing. Why did you come? A man does not bear arms for the sake of killing but to protect the things he values and loves most yan is no longer safe take feier away from here, the further the better thank you Gol... Surround them... This is mutiny! You'll share the same fate as teng bochang! You will pay for this! I'd like to see you try Sir, we can't stay here it's a trap! Kill them all!
