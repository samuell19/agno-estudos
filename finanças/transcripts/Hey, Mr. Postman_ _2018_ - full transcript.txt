Now, my plan is to swipe out my dirty urine with Tre's clean urine, then make it back to postage training just in time. Oh, damn. Tastes like chicken. Okay, here we go, half pint. I'm glad you can join us, Mr. Lincoln. Thank you. Good morning, people. My name is Frank Crawford. I'll be your instructor for the postal carrier training course. Being a postal carrier is not a game. This is Tracy Thompkins. She's carried the mail in all 50 states. Carrying the mail is the most important job in the world. Is something funny, sir? Oh, no sir. Me and Mr. Cocks was havin' a conversation. I'm sorry, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, the most integral part of the postal service is the operation of the postal vehicle. The postal truck is your friend. The postal truck is your baby. Today, we find out if you are up to task. Tracy, key. So, who's first? That'll be me. I do believe I was first in line. I do believe I was first in line. - Man, I'm first. - I was first, Mr. Crawford. Gentlemen, please. This is not grammar school, where we're tryin' to figure out who's first in line. I make those decisions. Mr. Cocks, you're up. Go ahead, pimp. Let's see what Cocks does. Let me see you top that. Thank you, Mr. Cocks. Mr. Lincoln, you up. Now, I'll show you how it's done, you feel me? You lookin', Cocks? Okay, I'll do this, baby. So, just cut it off? Okay. All right. Here we go. All right. Oh, shit! Oh, get it off me! Somebody get it off me! Oh, shit! Man, I got stung by the bee, get me out! Oh, shit! Man, you didn't get stung by no bee! Man, get somebody. Help me, Jesus! I need some peroxide. Man, what the hell? - What's wrong with you? - I need some witch hazel. I need somethin'. I got stung. I'm allergic, man. I can't die like this. It's right there, you see it? It's right there. I need somebody to suck it out. You ain't stung, man! Suck it out! I'll die from this. Man, give me my keys. Oh, shit. Okay, I'll get the key. We're done here. Everybody, movin' on. It's time for weather trainin'. Weather trainin' is super important, because you will operate in some uncomfortable weather conditions. Even though it's raining, you still have to deliver the mail. You must remain mentally strong, because nobody likes being wet, especially while they're workin'. You will learn to love it. You will learn to respect it. With that being said, Tracy will be pelting you with the water cannon while you attempt to put the mail in the proper boxes. If you fail this part of the training, it is over for you right now. So, with that, ladies and gentlemen, let's get wet. Right there, right there, right there, right there. Come on. There you go. You're the real deal, son. Come on, Lebron James. Way to go. Come on, young petal, make the move, make the move! Well done, well done. Get in there. Wow, way to go, Harry! Way to go, Harry! Way to frickin' go! All the way! Come on! You can do it! You can do it! Fight it, fight it! Come on, man, let's go, let's go. In the hole, in the hole. Yes! Get out of there, boy, get out of there! That's what I'm talkin' about! We got some mail carriers out here today, baby! Man, I don't think I can do this. There's water all over my face and shit. Man, I signed up to be a mail carrier, not Michael Phelps round this, you know what I'm sayin'? If you don't think you can hack it, quit. Oh, you would like that, wouldn't you? I ain't quittin'. I'ma outlast your ass, Mr. Cocks. We'll see about that. Hey, can I get everybody's attention? First of all, ladies and gentlemen, you guys have been amazing. Let me be the first to welcome you to the postal service. You're officially mail carriers. Now, we got some business to take care of before we get out of here. So, I got a couple of rules for you, and I'll be lettin' you know where you'll be stationed. Now, every station does not need a mail carrier, so at least one of you will be stationed with someone from this class. In which case, it is your position to lose. Now, there's two things that'll get you terminated. One is not delivering all of the sale ads. Don't be stealing no coupons, Jennifer. And, two, a roll away. Can anybody tell me what a roll away is? Mr. Cocks. That occurs when you do not turn your wheel towards the curb and apply your safety break. Your mail truck could roll down the street without you in it. That's exactly right, Harry Cocks. So, your mail truck is rolling down the street, and you're not in it. How dangerous is that? I got news for you: that's grounds for immediate termination. So, ladies and gentlemen, be careful out there. Make me proud. ♪ Till the sweat runs down my balls ♪ That echo sounds nice. ♪ Momma I got some money ♪ Oh, Lord have mercy. Hell no, if it ain't Mr. Harry Penis, the teacher's pet of the year. What's up, boy? Great, they got me down here with you. Look, I'm not here to make any friends, so you try to do your job, and I will do mine. Ain't that a bitch. You know what, you do your job, and I will do mine, you Jeffrey Dahmer lookin', ooh. All right, everybody, time for morning meeting. Let's go, let's go, come on, can I get some respect here? And I want y'all outta here on time for once. Show some respect. Thank you. Now, we have two new T E's joining us today, Mr. Lincoln and Mr. Cock. It's Cocks. Cocks. Y'all asked for it, now you got it. Tracy, please, morning meeting. Good morning, everybody. Mail is not heavy today, so everybody should have a good day today. Everybody. There's no rain in the forecast, but the heat index is up, so make sure you got plenty of water, Gatorade, or anything else to keep you cool out there. All right? Let's finish casing up your mail, so you can get outta here on time. Glad you could join us, Mr. Berry. My name ain't no God damn Mr. Berry. My name is Crazy Dave. Oh, okay. If you need more dog spray, come see me. All right, be safe, everybody. Mr. Lincoln, Mr. Cocks, stay here so Miss Kelly can put you with a trainer, okay? Oh, Scott, I want you to ride with Lincoln. Mark, you ride Cocks. Gentlemen, I need you to pay close attention to what they are teaching you. All right, thank you. How you doing? I'm good, brother. How you doing, man? All right. What's your first name again? I'm Brian. All right. I heard them calling you Mr. Lincoln. You want me to call you Mr. Lincoln or Brian? No, man, Brian's good. Okay, that's what I thought. Okay, Brian, well you already know I'm Scott, so you got any questions for me? Yeah, Scott, man, what's all these numbers, man? They're everywhere. Well, there is where we put all the DPS mail together by address and street name, so it's in some type of order when we're delivering. Oh, okay. All right, man, 'cause I'll tell you what, brother, if I gotta wake up to this every day, man, I'd probably get a damn headache. You don't have to worry about this yet, but eventually Miss Kelly will have you casing. Man, I ain't looking forward to that. Can Mr. Cocks and Lincoln come to my office, please? Oh, man, man, I think they found out about my felony, man. I thought the girl was 20, I swear. Look at your face. I'm just jokin', bro. Hey, look, man, which way do I go? That way. All right, gentlemen, you don't get your uniform allowance for another three months, which means rookies can obviously wear what they like, but do you think that'd make me happy? Do you think? Do you think? Over there's a box filled with stuff that has been donated from some of our regular carriers. Now, when you find something you like, you are more than welcome to put it on in the locker room down the hall. You can keep your balls in your draws in my office. You, too, Mr. Cock. Oh, it's Cocks. What? Cocks, with an S. Well, keep it all in your draws, all right? All five of 'em, however many you think you got. What is so funny? Cock, you know. I'll be back in a few minutes, okay? - All right. - You just silly. I don't know why I even hired you. I don't know why I bother with you. All right, let's see what we got here. Wait a minute, man, calm down. Oh, hell no. Man, this shit, this like Daisy Dukes, man, damn. Looks like I might as well be wearing a romper. Mr. Romper room, you should just be happy that you're getting some authentic post office uniforms. Yeah, whatever, man. I'm gonna be changing in the locker room. Yeah, you go right ahead. I'll be changing right here. Put my ass out in the open. All right. What's up? Now, you look like a postman. Okay, all right. All I gotta do now is teach you how to deliver mail. Hey, man, I'm ready, baby. What we gonna do today? What's first? Oh, you know what? First, man, I gotta stretch, man. Man, I don't know what's goin' on with these shorts, man. That's a good idea. Man, dude, I ain't stretchin' for real. Man, look it here, these shorts so tight, man, they huggin' my nuts to my thighs. Well, you do look professional, though. Whoo! Man. This ain't right. I already got my practice in. You're the one that's in training. Here, you drive. Okay, I'll drive. Get these shorts off my blue balls, you know? We can make it work. Hold on, man. I'm tryin' to get up in this. God damn! Look at this God damn Terry Crews lookin' motherfucker. When we start hirin' felons? Man, so this the new boy, huh? Yeah, they started phasing out the old trucks, started bringing in these new Nissan cargo vans. Oh, okay, so, hey, we gotta start payin' for our own gas? - Nah. - We don't? Company gives us a gas card. Gas card, woo baby. Well, let's get it crackin' then. Hey. Shit, boy, it's hot as hell in here, boy. What they got the air conditioner set on, Hell?

That's right, you're goin' on your big cruise. Miss Benham knows everything that's goin' on in this neighborhood. - Nothing gets by her. - Okay. Nothing.

Okay, we'll let's turn to the book of Job. That's Job. Dang, boy. Uncle, just finish the prayer. Okay. Lord, he was a faithful man, just not to his wife, and he was a good provider for his family, when he wasn't spendin' all his money on Newport kings and the lottery. And, he was the kinda guy that'd give you the shirt off his back, but he usually didn't have one, because he gambled it away. And, Lord, we love him, because you gave him to us. We may need to talk about that, too, Lord, but he gone, now, so, Lord, just comfort us now in our time of need. Amen. Oh, hell naw. What are you doing here, man? Me and Bernard used to be homies.

Look, man, just keep callin' for that ransom money. He's almost about to crack. Nigga, don't worry about the girl. I got everything under control over here. You just do your part. Man, you know I ain't about to hurt that little girl. I just want her brother to get those bands up. All right, I'll holla at you later. The hell's goin' on out here? Nothin', man. I was just puttin' mail in your mailbox. Oh, it's you, you ole fake ass country singer. Thought you was the man at that little club the other night, huh? Winning that contest, hollerin' at Jovanne. I'ma tell you one more time, man, leave that shit alone, Mr. Postman. Look, man, I'm not even on that, Mack. All right, look, I gotta finish my deliveries, man. Mm hmm. You be safe out here. Hey, Miss Kelly, I think I know where that little girl's at. Okay, no, I'll talk to you when I get back to the station. Okay, okay. Oh. Fuck. Oh, shit. Son of a bitch. Man. Oh, man, I can't believe this. - What, a roll away? - Yep. Feel sorry for you. Damn. What?! You just had a roll away accident? I mean, I was delivering, and then I just looked up and saw the truck rollin' down the street. Did you remember to turn the wheel towards the curb and set the brake? This is very important, Mr. Lincoln. Yeah, I'm pretty sure I did. - Pretty sure? - I'm pretty sure I did. Was there some damage done? Well, it hit a parked car. There's a little bit of damage to the hood, and the mail truck might have a little, wee bit of little crack in the window. What's that, west side? You know I gotta fire you, right? Miss Kelly. You can't let me go. I think I know somethin' about the kidnapped girl. I swear, I heard somebody talkin' about it on my route, just yesterday, whole hood talkin' about it. So, you want me to believe that you don't know whether or not you turned a wheel and set a brake, but you know where a baby, that's been missing for over three weeks, and can't no capable cop in town find her, but you, you found her? The one that don't know about a brake and wheel? You found her? I need your key to the truck and your time card now. That's what I'm trying to say. I was gonna call you. I got a call to make. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, who you callin'? Security. Everybody in the hood talkin' about it. I know what I'm talkin' about. - Please. - Yeah, I need you, Joe. Come on up. Miss Kelly, please, okay? Look, I swear, I'll solve this case. If I solved this case, you'll keep my job, right? Huh? Huh? Truck key. Time badge. Oh, you ain't gonna bend, huh? You know what happens on the news when them postal workers be gettin' fired. They be comin' back with machine guns. I'm just playin', I would never do that. But, Miss Kelly, please, just one more chance. Come on, one more chance. Be the governor. Give me a pardon. Okay, fine. I messed up. That's cool. Mr. Lincoln. - Yes? - Good luck. I can't believe this shit, man. I'm out of a job again. You know, man, I do remember, I did set the parking brake on that truck, too. I told my supervisor, too, man, I think I know who kidnapped that girl. I think it was Mack that did it. What you mean, Mack from the club? Yeah, man. I was by his house this morning. I heard him talkin' on the phone, talkin' about ransom money and shit like that. Jovanne said he been actin' funny lately, too. Damn, B, what you gonna do? I don't know. I need a plan. I think I know what I'ma do, though. Hold on. Hey, Jovanne? Hey, I need to meet up with you. All right. No, no, I'll tell you when I see you. All right. Hey, E-man, if I don't call you in four hours tops, all right, I'm gonna need you to send the police over to Mack's house. I'll text you the address. What's up cuz, you need my help? Nah, man. This is somethin' I gotta do on my own. Appreciate it, though. You sure about this, Brian? Mack always stays with his gun on his hip. Well, look, I'm as sure as I can ever be, all right? But, that's why I need you to be on point with this, - all right? - Okay. Anything goes wrong, that's both our ass. I got this. All right, let's go. Macksy. Macksy. Hey. I wanted to talk to you. I'm so sorry about everything that's been going on. I should've listened to you, and I really miss you. Come on in. Uh huh. The last time I seen you, you was with that funny postman dude. I know. - Can I be honest with you? - Talk to me. Well, I just was trying to make you a little jealous, and I wanted to win the contest. I needed the money. Yeah, well, he almost got his little ass whooped. I know, right? Do you have anything to drink, Macksy? I'm a little thirsty. Alcohol or water? Alcohol. All right, all right. Mm hmm. There you go. - Mm, yes. - Right, right. Cheers. Mm hmm, it's good stuff, huh? How about I just go freshen up really quick, huh? Oh, yeah, yeah, you do that. When you come back, I'ma beat it up. Go on with that. Yeah. Beat it up face. Come on. Come on, papi. Come on, woman, give me some help! Ow, I hit my booby. Oh, boy, my eye. Shit. - You all right in there? - Yes, I'm okay.

I think I'm gonna need another drink. You got it, baby. It all comes down to this moment. I'll never forget the look on her brother's face. I know Mack got that little girl somewhere in this house, but if Jovanne don't cover her end, we all in trouble. I got you a drink. You know what? I don't feel right without my gun. Aaliyah? Aaliyah?

Two. Three. What the? Bitch, you took my bullets? We did that. We did it. Man, that nigga decided to come. Shit. Come on. Aaliyah, come on up, baby girl. Come up here, baby girl. Oh, my God, you're okay. - All right? - Okay. All right, let's get you outta here. Come on. Mr. Lincoln, I called you here today to tell you how proud I am of you for finding little Aaliyah and to apologize. I am so sorry for firing you and not believing you. Mrs. Benham has recorded footage of that cocksucker Harry Cocks sabotaging your mail truck. Man, I knew he did that. But, I told you, I set that brake. Yes, you did. I told you, baby. I see everything on that street. I recorded everything. Miss Benham, thank you. You saved my life. And, we'd like to offer you your job back, but this time as master trainer, and this is the post office inspector. He wants to shake your hand in person. The post office commends you, Brian. Your brave actions are the reason that Aaliyah Brown is here with us today. And, congratulations. Thank you. Oh, Lord, I done saved a baby. Bring it in. I knew you had it in you. I knew it. We did it! We did it. Well, that's my story. Every postman has one, but this one was mine. As far as the post office goes, the gang's still there, most of them, anyway. Once I became master trainer, my first trainee was none other than Snuffleupagus. He's a pretty good worker, too. Now, Harry Cocks got fired once they found out he was the one that tampered with my brake. Word is that boy workin' over at B&M Bar-B-Que. They say he make a mean shoulder sandwich, too. When Mack finally woke up, the police was all over his ass. He got 20 years for the kidnapping for little Aaliyah. Me, I'm lovin' life, baby, 'cause you know what? For the first time in my life, I'm fully happy. I finally, finally got the love of my life. Me and Jevonne doin' real well, too. I'm even thinkin' about marryin' my baby. Who would've thought Brian Lincoln would be talkin' about marriage? Now, a part of that reward for findin' little Aaliyah was $10,000. I used that to help pay off my mom's bills, so she could finally get that surgery. When y'all first met me, they called me a loser. Now, when they see me, they say, "Hey, Mr. Postman!"
