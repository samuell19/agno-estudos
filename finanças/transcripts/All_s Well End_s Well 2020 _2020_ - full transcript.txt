I got pregnant recently, he didn't want bad karma on the baby, so he went collecting evidence to report them to the police. He hadn't even reached the police station... Late bloomer. You've still got it. I tried my best. Congratulations. Got a name yet? Boy or girl? Wait, who are these man eaters? He's called Crooked Tam, the boss of Dragon Gang, he's the most villainous criminal ever, drug trafficking, prostitution, robbery... he does it all! He thought you're dead, but he'll go after your wife. You need a hideout for you and baby. Hubby! Tam Tai-Ngok, nicknamed Crooked Tam, his pet phrase is "mother frigger”, used to be a street soldier for Dragon Gang, rose his ranks to the top with his ruthless fists. He started a trading company three years ago, running trading business as a legitimate businessman, and it's a listed company now. But the gang still does criminal dealings. But the gang still does criminal dealings. He's a legit businessman on the surface, but a despicable thug underneath. He likes showing off yet is extremely petty. He won't hesitate to smack whoever offends him. Although he makes money from hurting people, which fits our rule of engagement, this guy's not a scammer, but a gangster boss, we may die for tackling him! Exactly, we should vote for a decision. Since we're all here, let's vote now. This gangster will hurt more people if we don't take action, so I'll do it at all costs! Me too! Mm... I'll follow Monroe. That's 3 out of 5 votes already, let's do it then. The problem is not taking on him, but we don't know his weakness. This guy has money and men, we can't just go and guess his Achille's heel. Actually I've found out his soft spot, he loves diamonds. Such a sacrilege! Problem solved then. I got the information that, he will attend a diamond auction on Sunday, it'll be a great chance to approach him. Then I can disguise as a diamond broker to set him up. Then I can disguise as a diamond broker to set him up. I'm not gonna be the driver this time. The following item is an 18-carat diamond, which has been worn by Beyoncé on her performances... should be 30-carat. The minimum bid is $10 million, with one million increment. The auction begins now. 10 million, 11 million, 12 million, 13 million, 14 million, 15 million, any higher bid? Twenty 20 million 21 million! Mr. Chen, we will get the Beyoncé diamond. Anything on the diamond? Nothing, the entry has been deleted. Of course, it's been deleted! Really? - Twenty two, - 22 million. 23 million. - Twenty four, - 24 million. 25 million. - Twenty six, - 26 million. 27 million. Are you done yet? I won't last much longer. Cutting power is easy, just flip a switch in the electrical room. Wait... so many switches here! 33 million, going once. No more bidding? We're gangsters, can't let this loser win. Bid, bid! Going twice. Hubby! We'll kill him after the auction, rob the diamond for free! Seriously? I thought so too. Seems like they're quitting, I'll quit too if you don't cut the power. How come! I've turned everything off already! Hurry up! Going 3000th times... 3300th times... Going 300th... Going third, got it right finally. One, two, three Sold! Calm down everyone, it's just a power cut, please proceed to the room next door and have a seat. I'm going home. Don't tell anyone. Yes, Mr. Chan, it's just a power cut. The ring is yours, I guarantee you! No worries... ok? Mr. Lee! I found your diamond, that's why I'm called the Diamond Hunter, that's why I'm called the Diamond Hunter, just wait for your stone... My boss'd like to have a word with you. Hello. The Diamond Hunter? That's me. I've met loads of brokers, but how come I don't know you? Why? Brokers come in different ranks, Brokers come in different ranks, I only serve big clients, trying to keep a low profile. Sounds like hot air to me! Get me "the Eternal Star" then. The Eternal Star The Eternal Star The Eternal Star "The Eternal Star"! I'll Google it. I'll use Baidu. I'll check the dictionary. The Eternal Star You mother frigger, you have no idea! Bullshit, Diamond Hunter! A humongous raw stone called "the Eternal Diamond" was discovered in India's Golconda mine. A merchant cut it up into three 100 carat diamonds, A merchant cut it up into three 100 carat diamonds, naming them "the Eternal Stars” The three Eternal Stars were made into three identical necklaces. One is in the British Museum, which is not for sale. The second one belongs to a Brazilian called FaRay de Lama, The second one belongs to a Brazilian called FaRay de Lama, her net worth is US$30 billion, don't dream of acquiring it from her. As for the third one, nobody knows its whereabouts... but me. Really? I know its price too. How much? $100 million, black market price. $100 million only? I want it. Get me before Sunday, I'll cut you a fat commission! Cash? Cash, I'll wait at my office with cash. If I don't see the diamond on Sunday, I'll get your family coffins. How generous. Don't worry! We get 50% off for coffins. Uncle Four! We are a big client. Our mission: to bring "the Eternal Star" to Tam's office, I'm sure, there will be a gemologist for verification, so we must use a real diamond this time. It so happens that the Eternal Star from British Museum is in HK now, and will be exhibited on Monday. It's now sleeping in the safety vault. It's now sleeping in the safety vault. So we'll steal the diamond from the vault. No, we're borrowing it, it'll be returned before the exhibition. That means we need to get the diamond from the vault, sell it to the gangsters, get it back from them, put it back inside the vault as if nothing happened. It's hard enough breaking into the vault once, and to do it twice... Easy, just hack into their system, turn off the CCTV, unlock the vault, turn off the infrared alarm... we can even cut their connection to the police station. All we need is a way to hack in. Better hack a man. This guy is the vault's security manager, a perv who likes hiring girls for photo snapping, we should make good use of it. Honey trap! Not my game then. Why Tam insists on Sunday? It's his birthday, he has invited the press to his party. He wanna show off the diamond obviously. They'll hire a magician for performance, we must disguise as one, swap the diamond from Tam during the performance with a fake. Let's get going. Monroe will deal with the security manager, Wing-Chung and Mona will take care of the magician, Wing-Chi, get a fake diamond. I have something important to do. Ming! Your camera looks so pro! What do you do? I work in security. Security? You must know how to fight, like a real man! Pretty boys are so annoying, I prefer real men like you! Sorry my memory card is full, I'll get another one, wait. I don't drink. Come on! Don't be such a killjoy. So what kind of security are you? I'm a senior security manager of a safety vault. I'm a senior security manager of a safety vault. A vault, that's so cool! Let's take our pictures there instead! There're only some stupid trees here. I don't think it's a good idea. It's a brilliant idea! New place will stimulate you. It's my first time to visit a vault, and your first time to bring someone in, so it's a first for us both! Don't get the wrong idea, I'm just talking about photography! You're a real man, so don't tell me that you can't... I can, I can! Can I take your photo first? Hey! You... Get me some cigarettes... and snacks. You have a toothache, boss? Yes, hurry up! What's in this vault? House deeds, antiques, jewellery, money, that sort of things. What's the most valuable thing here then? A 100 carat diamond "the Eternal Star". I love diamond since I was little! 100 carat is huge, it enormous! Can I see it, please? No you can't. Just a peek... No... If you satisfy me, I'll satisfy you too. Wow! This diamond is stunning! Careful there! Can you help me put it on? Well... be careful! Easy! Easy! Oh no! Where is it? I won't touch it, get it yourself. Ah... this is too much, I can't take it, let's go back to the studio. Time's up. What? You've booked me for two hours, time's up now. I'm not done yet, I'll extend it. I'm fully booked today, book me longer next time, cheapskate. Bye-bye. Got it, big sister! I need a prop for this magic trick. Miss... Can you take off your... ring, please? Sure. Such a beautiful ring, what should I change? Its colour, shape, or make duplicates? Watch. Where did it go? I lost your ring, let me get you a drink. No, no, don't stop. Thank you, you're so awesome, so cool! I'm not a loose guy, just on the lips, no cheeks. Who else wanna try? Me! Another beautiful lady, have a seat. I have a ring too. A ring again! Normally guys can't have another go... right after he finishes, you know, but since you're so pretty, I'll try. This ring... watch. I lost your ring again, why don't... I wanna search you. Told you I'm not loose. Hey, not this pocket. There's nothing right? Let me get you a drink. How come there're so many? Excuse me, move over please, thanks. We heard someone is stealing... in disguise as a magician, who's the pickpocketing magician? Sir I'm the magician, but I didn't pickpocket. I did lose my ring. Even the Secretary of Justice'll get arrested for stealing, let alone a magician. I've just put the ring into the glass just now. Any proof? No. Just kidding my dear, of course I do, these are all my people, I just handed the ring to him, he threw it to her, she passed it to her, she put the ring into the glass, that's it! Yes I did throw the ring! Yes I did pass it! Yes I did put it into the glass! You heard it, Officer, I just don't know why there're so many drinks now. To prove your innocence, do you mind if I pat you down? Here, take your time. This is my phone! When did you steal my bracelet? You guys are under arrest on suspicion of stealing collectively! Follow me to the police station. We're innocent. Come with me! Sir I only do magic tricks, Officer. Do it at the police station then! Go. Grab a few nice props quickly, so that Wing-Fu can play with them. Is it necessary to text back at once? Are you a woman? She'll get paranoid if I'm slow. Just call if you want to reply instantly! She can't hear you over a text, it's so impersonal. Being personal is to love on a spiritual level, Being personal is to love on a spiritual level, it's not just about kissing, hugging and sweet talking, it's not just about kissing, hugging and sweet talking, it's about communication. That's the way to indestructible love, done. Nonsense! I knew you wouldn't get it! After all smart people are in minority. Words are our weapons, not fists. Since you're a brute, you're probably quite dim. Dating online at your age isn't a clever thing either. What do you think if I pour this in? Nothing's happening... I was just asking, why did you put your face there? Do it yourself then! Where're you going? Shower! Gotcha at last, god damn it! You're getting more handsome now... why has your tattoo moved? Cut the crap! Give me back my money! I almost ended up in prison last time, I'm gonna beat you to a pulp now! Hit him. It hurts. Don't move, did you hit my head? I'll blow up yours now. Stop peeking, your boyfriend owes me money, I'll let him go if you pay for him. It's not my business, it's him who owes you, not me. Look at you, you obviously dress like his chick... or perhaps you can be mine. Nobody leaves without paying me. Ok, let's just all stay here. I'm scared... I'll do it myself, here... it's worse... So, Mr. Smarty Pants? I didn't see anything just now. Are you kidding me? I'll call you back. Boss, the magician's master said his student is arrested, either we cancel or he'll stand in, see if you're ok with him. Of course! Who else? I thought so too. Get me the bill! Yes... cheque! I stole your wallet. Smart ass! Come steal my gun then. Your gun? No. Your bullets? Yes. Bravo! That's awesome! I wanna work for you. Work for me? Sorry, but I never steal, I only rob people. Why should we hire you? To eat with us? I can stop thieves from stealing from you. Ok, you're hired. Right, so when did you steal it? The fake looks totally phoney next to the real one. It's less phoney by itself. Take the real one for the deal, then swap it with the fake later. Why am I the only one changed for the rehearsal? Why are you wearing these pants? There're ladies here. They said they're fine. Haha... ok, let's try moving around. Come on. The sisters will help me with the show, Wing-Chi will swap the necklaces, we have one minute. Go. One minute? I can do it in seconds. Ok, one minute sharp. That's it, we'll leave at 5:00 to kick some ass! Now let's get changed. Ok! Hey, Lance Armstrong, let me out. Sorry, I totally forgot. Don't be so petty. What're you doing here? I'm the magician. I help the magician setting up. I'm the magician's assistant. Mm... I'm the assistant's assistant. I'm... not related to the magician. Come with me. Alright magic people, follow me. Have a look around, isn't it beautiful? Isn't it beautiful? It's crazy cheap, just $30 million. Even the FBI can't crack this system, my place here is as solid as the Rock of Gibraltar, I can do whatever I want. I'm sorry. You'll be very safe. Let me introduce you, this is Asia's most authoritative gemologist, who will verify the authenticity of your diamond. Listen. If the diamond's real, this case of money is yours; but if it's fake, it'll carry your dead body. Just curious, how did you find this stone out of 7.6 billion people on earth? The diamond was in the hands of a village chief back in India. The village is in Baharja. A friend of mine had a wedding there, I was his groomsman. The village is in Baharja, Northern India, I've been there, the chief's called Burada, I know him. You know him? Seriously? Don't you know Burada died of testicular cancer? His son Buraklada is the chief now. And can I count my money quietly? $100 million is a lot. You distracted me so I'll have to start over again. You distracted me so I'll have to start over again.
