--== McEphie ==-- [tires screech] [engine revving] One hundred twenty. That's too low, how about 200? -[Engr. Cuevas groans] -One hundred thirty? Let's make it 180. It's in great condition. How about 130? [hums] What do you say? Fine, 175. -[moans] 120? -[moans] I thought we agreed on 130? -Deal, 130. -Wait, 130 is-- [moans] You're a good kisser! -Honey? -Hon... What's this? What's the meaning of this? I'm just discussing the rates with your husband. -How dare you! -No! You got it all wrong! -Calm down! -It's not what you think! Damn you! After all I've done for you, this is what I get? I bet you've been seeing her for a long time! [Engr. Cuevas wife] How dare you, honey! Hey! Come back here! -That's our car! -Hey! Come back, Miss! Don't just stand there, do something! [Engr. Cuevas' wife] Call the guardhouse! Call the police! My goodness! Do you think we can pawn that car to Lupo for P150,000? The engine is in good condition. What do you expect, it was owned by an engineer. Hey! Get some food for your grandma before you eat! But, Mom! You can't just hit me whenever you like. [in Chabacano] Mom, let's eat. Leave that to Enteng! He'll take care of those clothes later. [Azon speaking in Chabacano] It's getting late. Someone might take interest in these. Better safe than sorry. Come on! The food's great! It's imported. Why is there a car in our garage? -Is it ours? -[in Filipino] It's not. It's ours. Why are you still up? Stop that, your eyes are drooping. It's almost done, Mom. As if you understand English... Come on. Rosa, let's not pawn the car to Lupo. I like the car, the engine is in great shape. I'll convert it to a cab and earn from it. What? Are you kidding? You won't make much out of it. With the price of gas, you'll hardly earn from it. If that's true, then why are there a lot of cabs around the city? What I mean is, we can make what you earn in a month, we can make in just one day. You don't get it, I want a regular job. A job that doesn't intrigue our neighbors. What do they care about us, anyway? Even if they don't care, they still spread gossips about us. -So you'll be a cabbie for them? -Not for them! For myself! It's not every day that we have a racket. I'm getting bored here at home. I don't care what other people say. But I do! Finally, you admit it. Someone wants to be a cabbie... "What does your husband do for a living?" "He's a taxi driver." "Wow, so Dado is now a changed man?" Why do you say so? That car was stolen. He's a taxi driver and a carnapper at the same time. Give me a break, Rosa. Why? You're getting pissed already? Are you mad? Mm? Rosa, let me have the car. I promise I'll give you my earnings every day. [Oca] Don't be choosy when it comes to passengers. So what if their drop-offs are only close by? It's better than driving around without a passenger. Just look at Esmi. She's gotten into several fights with cabbies. [Esmi] Oh, those drivers. They become choosy especially when it rains and when you're carrying a heavy load. What plate do you want? There's blue, red, green, and yellow. Only the yellow ones are allowed for cabs, stupid. How should I know? Here. [Clara] Azon! Dado's here! [Dado] Mom! Where's Enteng? I'm sure he's gambling again. I've been waiting for hours already. I even had to bother Clara just so I could pee. Please hand me my things. Here you go. -Mom, that's enough. -We might still earn a few. Enteng! I'll go ahead, let's play again tomorrow. Give us a chance to regain our losses. But we have to go home. You stubborn kid! We've been looking for you only to find out you're just gambling here! You're getting addicted to gambling. [Enteng] Ouch! -[beggar] Alms, please. -Shut up! Wow! Grandma earned a lot! Can you give me a bonus? Hey, don't touch that. You're just saving your money for nothing. I'm saving up for emergency. I'm not like your mom who's irresponsible when it comes to money. Where are the bills? Enteng! Give it back! [Enteng] Let me have them, Grandma! You sly kid! How dare you steal from your own grandmother? Give it to me! -Fine, I'll return it. -Enteng, come here. Rosa, talk some sense to your son. He does nothing but gamble. Whenever I need to pee, I have to ask for Clara's help. And to think she's crippled. -You're gambling again? -Ouch! Ouch! I told you to look after your grandma! Ouch! You're ripping my ear off! Come here. Mm. Do you recognize him? Who does he look like? He looks like Jojo, the male prostitute from Morayta. How about this one? She looks like Ruffa Gutierrez. Doesn't she look like your mother? But you don't have a mole on your cheek. -Why? Does Ruffa have one? -But she looks just like her! -[giggles] -Oh, my ugly son! Mom, you're being annoying. You should be thankful someone still kisses you. You stink, go take a bath. [suspenseful music playing] -Dado? -Yes? Don't take your cab out tomorrow. We're attending a wedding. Wedding? [emcee] I would like to present to you the parents of the groom! Here's Engr. Trinores Santos and Ms. Annabelle Ochoa Santos... That's your father. Remember his face. [emcee] Congratulations! Mommy! Is that old man really my father? I told you already, yes. Don't butt in later. I'll do the talking. -Just smile. -Okay. Atty. Palomo! How are you? What are you doing here? I'm coming to your daughter's wedding. I saw it in the papers. I must say, this event is too luxurious. But the food is quite bland. This is a special occasion for us. I don't want any disturbance. Who wants to, anyway? Oh, Atty. Palomo. You haven't changed at all. Excuse me, I have to go inside. Wait a second. Before you go, I'd like you to meet your son. What? Our son. I even named him after you. -Vicente Palomo Jr. -What's this nonsense? You want me to cause a scene in here? What do you want from me? I just want you to acknowledge your son. Take a good look. You have one thing in common... -You're both dark-skinned! -That's not substantial proof! You really have no shame at all. You abandoned us before, and now you're denying your own son? Make sure you leave something for your son before you die. [man] My friend! Hey, buddy! Excuse me. Let's talk some other time. [Atty. Palomo] Why aren't you with your wife? [man] She's at home with our grandchildren. [Atty. Palomo] Come on, let's go inside. [Atty. Palomo's wife] Put that in the car. [man] Yes, ma'am. [Atty. Palomo's wife] Be careful with those. Enteng, call Dado. [Rosa] Enteng, come here. Here. Dado, carry the heavy ones. I'll return this if it's defective. That came from a cargo shipment. So no return, no exchange. If it has a warranty, would I sell it to you for a cheap price? Three thousand? I don't sell fake items. You know my reputation, I tell my customers if my product is secondhand or brand new. So I assure you, this blender is brand new. Wait, I'll just get the money. Can I pay you a thousand first? Sorry, I don't do installments. I'll just offer it to another friend. Okay, I'll pay in cash. You're so prudent, Rosa. I'll surely hear a mouthful from Tonyo when he finds out about this. I'm sure your gluttonous children will love you even more. They should because I'm one of a kind... Rosa, someone's looking for you. -Who is it? -It's Lupo. [lighter clicks] Thanks but you shouldn't have bothered. Check this out. We're robbing this house on Friday. [ominous music playing] [sniffles] Take me to Fairview. Please pull over, I'm getting out. [sobbing] How much? Jing, don't bother. Dado? I was in jail for five years... You never even came to visit me. Dado, I'm married already. My life's changed. Let's not bring the past up. I heard from my sister that you got married. Is he rich? What's with that tone? Are you saying I married him for his money? Didn't you? Money makes the world go round. If you have it, you can buy anything you want... -Even a spouse. -Dado... You committed a crime! You were imprisoned for theft! Didn't it occur to you that I married somebody else because of that? Why didn't you wait? It's not a lifetime sentence! Why... Why were you crying a while ago? It's nothing. I just had an argument with my mother-in-law. I made a simple mistake and she overreacted. But as for my husband, I have no complaints. He's kind and he loves me. Is that your first baby? Uh... No, this is our second. Oh, I see. -What's the name of the eldest? -Iris. -Iris June. -That name sure is classy! -Romy thought of that name. -[scoffs] Romy? That bastard? He's your husband? That's not fair, Jing! Damn it! That bastard was courting you while I was in jail! -He's not a bastard! -You both betrayed me! Damn it! I endured my time in jail! I did so because I knew someone was waiting for me outside! Can you blame me? You've made countless promises about starting a new life! Then, I found out you were pregnant. I thought the baby was mine. I felt the urge to change because of that. Damn it, Jing! I promised myself to change once I get out of jail. But what did you do? You married another guy! I lost without even putting up a fight! I almost lost my mind! I saw no reason to leave jail after that! And now you're telling me... I'm not the father of your eldest child? You know, we should stop seeing each other. Nothing good comes out of it. [Dado] Tell me the truth. Is Iris really not my daughter? [Jing] Let go of me. [Dado] Answer me. She's not your daughter. What took you so long? I've been waiting for you. -Why? -What do you mean "why"? Today's Friday. Have you forgotten? We're supposed to go out tonight. [doorbell dings] Good evening. Is the lady of the house there? She's not here. She's in Aklan. Can you give this to her? This is from Europe. Please keep it safe. [grunting] [woman] Hey! No, please! What are you gonna do? Take everything away. [Rosa] Leave her to me. Just go and help get those antiques. [woman crying] Why is there only 50 here? How much do you want? Lupo and I agreed on 80. Isn't that right, Lupo? -She's right, uncle. -I'm not talking to you. But you said it was my call. Damn it! I said I'm not talking to you! Why are you taking their side? Are you their damn lawyer?! You earned a fortune from the car, right? -What car? -Dado's cab. [scoffs] That's none of your business. It came from our sideline. That had nothing to do with our business. [Tiyong] You can't do side jobs, it's dangerous! You don't have any protection. And you might get me into trouble! I'm your boss so you should work only for me! Wait. I don't remember agreeing to that. Ah, I'm getting sleepy. Lupo! Take care of this. Wait, this is still short of 30. Give it to us so we can all get some rest. -I said 50 only! -Rosa, I'll pay you next time. Why aren't you keeping your word? You're like a fucking gay whore! Hey, stay out of this! I'm talking to Rosa and not to you! Jo! Don't threaten us, because we'll risk our lives for that 30,000! What's the problem? Don't move or else, I'll blow this up! This won't take long, just look straight here. [doctor] You know, glaucoma takes time before developing. But as of now, your nerve and eyesight are already affected. Because your glaucoma's in the latter stage already, surgery is the only treatment. But unfortunately, it may cost a fortune. The choice of undergoing surgery is all up to you. [kids chattering] [Jing] Do you have everything you need? [Iris] Yes. -Ma'am, your bag. -[Jing] Thank you. Have fun, baby. -[Jing] Bye! -Bye, Mom! ["Mula Sa Puso" playing on screen] ♪ I hope you always think Of me ♪ [in Chabacano] What's happening? Rico is kissing Claudine. [Enteng] Mommy, let's just call for another cab. -I want to sleep already. -[Azon] Stop whining. I told Dado to pick us up at 11:00, right? -Why is our gate open? -Dado? Dado? Grandma, Dado's not here yet. Our cab is not yet here too. [woman] Rosa! The cops arrested Dado! What? When? A while ago, when he arrived around 9:00. What did he do? What happened? Why was he arrested? Are you sure those men were cops? I'm sure because they were in uniform. Enteng, get inside. -Take your grandmother with you. -Listen to your mother. What about Dado? Your mom will take care of that. [man] Why do you have a gun? Do you know that this is illegal? Why do you have this? Answer me! Answer me! -For protection, sir. -From whom? From some bastards or from us? But you're also a bastard... So you'll use this against bastards like yourself? No, sir. -I'm a changed man, sir. -You fool! [grunts] You say you're "going straight", huh? [groaning] But you're using a robbed vehicle? I had the car's plate number verified in the office, but it had no records. [grunts] You're too ambitious! [screams, groans] [Dado coughs] Come in! -Sergeant, phone call. -Who is it? It's Lupo. -[Lupo] Doc, thank you. -[man] It's okay. Anytime. [Lupo] Thanks again. And sorry for the trouble. -Just try to eat, come on. -See? I told you already, you can't go against Tiyong! When you get in trouble, who do you run for help? Who else but Tiyong! What's gonna happen to Dado's taxi? Screw that, we can't get it back anymore. Just be thankful that Dado was released. I still have a feeling that your uncle was behind this. Instead of accusing him, can't you at least be thankful that he helped you out? I'm sure one of your neighbors sold you out to the cops. You should blame yourselves for showing off to your neighbors. You're not politicians. Have some coffee, Lupo. -Thank you. -Mom, why are you still awake? I'm worried about the bloodstains on Dado's shirt. Don't worry about that, go to bed. What are we going to do now, Lupo? For now, you have to lay low and move out of this house. I know a place in Project 8. The rent is cheap and your safety is secured because it's secluded. Now remember, don't give your trust away easily. For all you know, there could be spies around you. [somber music playing] [cat meows] A cat! [Azon] I'm getting tired of this life. All we do is move from house to house. [Enteng mimics cat meowing] Mommy, I found a cat. Let go of that, it's dirty. But I promise to take care of it. No. It will only make a mess in our house. Besides, its crap stinks. -I'll bathe it then-- -I said no! I said no! I'm allergic to cats. [cat meows] [woman] Dear sister, how are you? I got your letter yesterday. I can't sleep because of what happened to daddy. I'm sure he now realized that smoking is bad for his health. Cora and I will attend a prayer meeting tomorrow... [woman mumbling] [woman] And you know what, he's really good. He was able to analyze and confirm the details. [man mumbling] [man] Good news. Lauren has been promoted to head nurse. We can now afford... [woman] I'll introduce you to my friend Engr. Rivera. He's a widower but he's only 38. Do you remember that auditor from Batangas? He sent me a birthday card... [man] Congratulations, sister. You deserve all the happiness in the world. I'm sorry we couldn't make it to your wedding... Lolit has already given birth. I'm sure next year, you're going to be a mother too. It's so fulfilling to be a parent. But of course, we have to be prepared for future responsibilities... By the way, our baby's name is Lyca. [Rosa moaning] [Dado] Wait a second, Rosa. [moans] Ouch! Can't you see I'm injured? That hurts! [sighs] [Dado groans in pain] [Dado] I spent five years in jail. [Jing] I'm already married. [Dado] Jing... [Dado] Is it true that Iris is not my daughter? [Dado] Jing! Jing! Jing, there's a man looking for you. -Do you know him? -No. Dado, let's go! Hurry! [in Bicolano] Jing! Don't be afraid! [indistinct mumbles] [grunts, groans] It's getting late. [announcer mumbling over mic] [people clamoring] -[man 1] Our horse lost! -[man 2] Aw, shit! [man 1] Man, I got lucky! -[man 2] Did you win? -[man 2] Yeah! [phone rings] Fortune Marketing, hello? -Jing! -Mom? You take over, I'll just go to the stockroom. Yes, Mom. Some smuggled goods are arriving at the pier. But you won't get them yourselves. You just wait here. The goods will be transferred to you, after receiving it, take it to Tiyong's warehouse. Okay? How much will we get from this, Lupo? It's better to settle it this early. So that when we get to Tiyong, there will be no confusions. Forty-thousand. And he named the price himself. That's good enough, Rosa. [Rosa] Dado. [Oca] There are only four kinds of vegetables. First, bitter gourd for the bones. Second, squash for the eyes. Third, eggplant to please the ladies. -[all chuckles] -[man 2] Nice! -[man] And fourth, peanuts! -[man 2] Peanuts? Peanuts for man's pleasure! [laughter] I got one more. There's this contest on who had the most number of children held at Araneta Coliseum. The first contestant was from Japan. -He had a hundred children! -[man 2] A hundred? -A hundred kids! [chuckles] -[man 2] Wow, that's a lot. [suspenseful music playing] Damn you, Tiyong! That bastard! -You should've listened to me. -That fool! -If we sold that car to Lupo... -Crap! Instead of sticking with your plan, we could've earned something. Why does he care anyway?! It's our car! [Dado] And we have the right to do anything with it! Does he own it? Damn him! Hey! What's going on there? [Azon] You're too loud! It's nothing, Mom! It's about our boss who keeps pushing us around. Damn it! Here's your cut, that's 30,000. Hire a hitman to take him down! No, I'll do it myself. Don't he dare come near me or else, I'll stab him. [whispers] Turn that off. Why, Grandma? Let's go upstairs. [Dado shushes] Stay in the kitchen. Mom... Hurry. Hey! -[whispers] You stubborn kid! -Ouch! -Get in there! Go! -[Azon] Come here. [knocking on door] -Who is it? -[Oca] It's me, Oca. -What is it? -A letter. It's for you. [Rosa] What does it say? It's from Belen. Father... He's gone. My condolences, man. That's life, Dado. We'll all get there. [crickets chirping] [sad music playing] [woman] Ma'am, here it is. Cash. Sir, just pay at the counter. When will you deliver the karaoke machine? Tomorrow, but maybe in the afternoon. I'm going home to Bicol. Father's dead. My condolences. -Sir, here's your rice cooker. -Thanks. I'm bringing this home for my sister. [sighs] Bye. Enteng, stay there. Lupo. Lupo! You bastards set Dado up so you could get our car! -What are you talking about? -Goddamn you! You still have the guts to act innocent? You made Tiyong mad! It's your boyfriend's fault for wanting to drive a cab! It's none of your business! Dado and I worked hard for that car! Damn you! Don't curse at me! -Get mad at the boss, not at me. -But you knew about this... I knew nothing about that! You know me, Lupo. I don't like getting swindled... Then what are you gonna do about it? What are you gonna do about it? I can't do anything! -I told you not to argue... -Return our car! He won't return it! -If that's so... -What can I do about that? Then go find other people to fool... He's already old! -We'll just find another backer! -If he's in a bad mood-- -Damn you! -You can't leave, Rosa! We have a son! You bastard! You're not Enteng's only father, there's a lot of you f****rs! Enteng! Enteng! [indistinct chatter] Does it fit? Yes, Mommy. Which of the three do you want? All of it, Mommy. -You materialistic kid! -Ouch! But I have three fathers. That means I should have three pairs of shoes as well. Miss, I'll buy them all. -Cash or credit? -Cash. [Dado's father] Will you do it again? [Dado] No! You damn kid! I'll make you pay! Stop it! [grunts] You bastard! [Dado] Stop it, please! [Dado's mom] Celso! That's enough! [indistinct shouting] [speaking in Bicolano] Belen! Dado's here. Dado... [Belen sobbing] [dramatic music playing] Mom, here's the soap. Wow, someone wore his shoes to the store. What do you care? -Ouch! I was just joking, Mom! -Where's the change? It's just five pesos, let me have this. Don't fool me. I know the price of soap. I gave you 50, so where's the change? -But I bought a newspaper. -Where is it? It's there. Hey! Take off your shoes and help me! But, Mom, I'm going somewhere! And who gave you permission to leave? Take off your shoes and go fetch some water! [Enteng scoffs] [Enteng] So irritating. You have any complaints? -Enteng? -Yes, Grandma? [in Chabacano] Come with me, we're going to church. [in Filipino] Mom, stop asking for alms. You're no beggar. [in Chabacano] But I'm getting bored in this house. [in Filipino] Why do you get bored? We have a radio and a television. I wanna go out! I feel so lonely in this house! I miss the noise of the outdoors. I also miss Juan and the fortune-teller Clara. Oh, Mom. When will you realize that I feel ashamed with what you're doing? Why? Do you think you make me proud with what you're doing? Enteng! Hang on, I'll just put my shoes on. Enteng... There's 200 pesos on top of my drawer. -Just take a cab. -Okay. Grandma! -[woman] Anybody home? -[knocking on door] Anybody home? -Good afternoon. -What do you want? I'm from the Center for the Blind. I'm just soliciting donations for the blind. [scoffs] Oh, missy, I know your gimmick. I used to do that back in the day! [knocking on door] [man] Anybody home? Anybody home? Anybody home? Does Generosa Magsingal live here? Why?

[sighs] I think I want to go back home. What will you do there? [sighs] I own a small piece of land there. And what will you do with it? Plant pili nuts? [chuckles] I can do a lot with the land. There's a lot to do in Guinobatan, I can even drive a jeepney for my brother-in-law. [sighs] What if Mayon Volcano erupts again? But we're far from that volcano. Why are you suddenly eager to go back home? Did your sister scold you again? No, I've been planning that for a long time already. But I just couldn't do it because my father was mad at me. Your call. I think it's better if we leave Tiyong's group. I'm tired of stealing. Don't you have plans of quitting? Why should I? It's our source of income. No, what I mean is... Don't you want a change in your life? I've changed, Dado. I don't work in a club anymore. -What about Enteng? -What about him? How can he go to school if we keep on hiding and moving? Until now, he's still in second grade! Don't you have plans of sending him to school? Let him finish high school so he won't grow up to be dumb! Hey, Dado! if you compare Enteng to other kids, you'd know who's the dumb one! Enteng grew up without a father, and I'm not worried because in case I die, -he can survive! -What kind of life? A gangster's life? Enteng! Enteng! Wake up! I want to talk to you! [groans] What is it? Do you really want to study? Do you hear me? You wanna go to school or not? I want to. You damn kid... if that's so, then why do you play hooky? [Enteng] Mom! -I take my studies seriously! -What for? So the principal can tell me that you've been caught gambling in the comfort room? -[Rosa] Admit it! -[Enteng] Mommy! You were always caught gambling in the comfort room, right? -[Enteng cries] -Admit it! You damn kid! You even drag your classmates into it! You even stole a necklace from your teacher which turned out to be a fake! You fool! [Rosa] How many times did I send you to school? Twice, right? Twice! But all you do is fight with your classmates! Admit it! You always fight with them, right? Tell me the truth! Come here! And now Dado accuses me of being a bad mother all because of your foolishness! Is it my fault that until now, you're still in second grade? [stutters] Yes, Mom... I'm sure all parents want their kids to finish school! Damn it! Is there any hope left for you?! You think my job's easy? My life is always at risk every time I get out of this house! [in Chabacano] Rosa, watch your mouth! Are you blaming me for this? [in Filipino] So, Enteng... You really want to study? I want to. I'll enroll you next school year. -Don't screw up this time, okay? -Yes, Mommy. There, there... That's enough, we'll go out later, okay? Mom, I have to go. Aren't you having breakfast first? Where are you going? I'm going to Oca's place. Stop crying. I told you, we'll go out later. [woman] Fix that already. The owner will pick it up tomorrow morning. Where are the others? Ask help from them. -My friend! -[Rosa] My friend. Where are you going? You look so nice today. I always look nice! -Is Dado here? -No, he's not. He told me he's going here. How about Oca? He's over there, feeding his roosters. Come in. Never mind, I just thought Dado was here. That's why I came. -Anyways, I'll go ahead. -Okay, bye. [in Chabacano] This looks good on you! And it has a nice color. Are you sure? I don't think it fits me well. [in Filipino] No. [in Chabacano] It does! Look, I bought other colors too. There's red, lavender... Where's Enteng? [sighs] Feeding his cat. Enteng! [Enteng speaks in Filipino] Yes, Grandma? -Hey, put that cat away. -Mommy! I'll just get those clothes outside. Look, I bought you a school bag. School bag? Why is it too big? It's big so you can fit all your things in it. You can even use it for camping. Mind you, it's expensive! But, Mommy, school doesn't start soon. So? I just wanted to buy you a bag! -Oh, my son's going to school! -Stop it, Mommy! Do you love Mommy? -[Enteng mumbles] -Answer me. Hey. You got your saliva all over me. What's wrong with that? You should be thankful that I'm still fond of you. -[Enteng giggling] -You stink. I'm sure you didn't take a bath again. Dado. -Dado, look at my new bag. -[Dado] Hey. Mommy bought it for me. -It's nice, right? -I thought you're staying late at Oca's? -You didn't go out anymore? -We didn't. -He and his wife were going out. -I bought you a polo. Try it on and see if it fits. Thank you. [water running] -Dado. -What? Will I also grow a lot of hair when I grow up? Before you grow your pubic hair, -you must get circumcised first. -I don't want to, that hurts. It won't. Besides, a doctor will do it. Your mom's slap is more painful than that. What happens if I don't get circumcised? All men get circumcised. If you don't, you'll have freaky kids. [jeers] That's not true. Mommy told me Lupo is not circumcised, she even told me I'm his son. He's not your father. So who's my father then? I also don't know. Just ask your mommy. I don't get her. -Going somewhere? -[Dado] Yeah. I'm going to see Boy Kulot, an old friend from jail. I heard he got released already. We were close back when I was still in jail. Bye. [horn honking] [horn honking] Fortune Marketing, hello? -[woman] Speaking. -Ma'am, what do you need? Who's this? Tessie, for Jing. Will you stop following me? It's irritating. -Sorry, ma'am. -Mom? [people chattering] Hello? Hello? -He already hung up, who was it? -Your gay manicurist. -Louie. -Ma'am? Please lower the air-conditioning's temperature. -I'm feeling cold. -Yes, ma'am. [Jing groaning] Mom? -Ma'am Jing? -Mom. Mom! [screaming] Louie, prepare the car. Tessie, call Romy. Hurry, tell him that Jing is about to give birth. [Mrs. Tantoco] My grandchild, don't come out yet. Let's get you to the hospital. Hey, hurry up. -[woman speaking over P.A.] -Okay, daddy's treating. What do you want to eat? I want Japanese food. Japanese food again? -Don't you like Chinese food? -I don't like Chinese food. -I want Japanese food, tempura. -Tempura it is. Okay, okay. Now, press down. Daddy, when is mommy going home with the baby? I don't know. -We'll ask the doctor tomorrow. -Okay. -[Romy] Here we go. -[elevator bell dings] Jing? Dado? What are you doing here? Nothing, just checking on you. I brought some oranges. Dado, you shouldn't have come here. What do you need? What's wrong with paying you a visit? Please. Don't bother me anymore. The nurse might see us and tell Romy about this. So please leave. Jing... I just want to know if Iris June is my daughter. You don't stop, do you? She's not your daughter. She's Romy's. How's that possible? My sister, Belen, talked to your sister and told her that you're carrying my child! Maritess didn't know what happened to me. Iris isn't your daughter, Dado! Jing? Dado, leave! Dado? Is that you? Maritess, didn't you tell my sister that Jing is pregnant, and I'm the father? Iris June is not your daughter! Maritess, call for security. Dado, please leave. Jing's right, you're not Iris' father. Damn you! You're all liars! Nurse, call for security. This man is harassing me. Go now, just do that later. [gasps] [dramatic music playing] -[horn honks] -[tires screech] "Be wary of rumors. This will ruin your relationship." [Azon] What else? [Azon grunts] "Don't jump into conclusions without knowing all sides of the story." -[Enteng whistling lightly] -[cat meowing] Good evening, Mom. Oh, Louie, I didn't know you're home. Can you adjust the air-conditioning? I'm getting the chills. What's up with you? Rosa, please cut it out. [groaning] I think I'm about to give birth. Quick, get the car ready. It hurts. Sweetheart, why aren't you helping me? Take me to the hospital. -[Rosa groans] -Damn it! Will you please stop that? Go to hell! [Rosa] You're seeing Jing behind my back? What are you talking about? Don't deny it, I know already. Your visit to Boy Kulot was just an alibi. I followed you to the hospital, you went to see Jing. You bastard, how dare you. You're even wearing that polo I gave you. -[Dado grunting] -[Rosa groaning] -Don't hurt me, you animal! -Stop it! [Rosa] I'm not your wife, so you don't have any right to hurt me! Aren't you being rude to me? -You really won't stop? -You think I don't mind? Damn you! Take that off. Take that off! Damn you. Take that off! Are you crazy? You're jealous because of a pregnant woman? [Rosa] No. -Tell me, do you still love her? -[Dado] It hurts. -Do you still love her? -[Dado] She's not my mistress. Tell me the truth. I put up with you. [Rosa] I gave you shelter, a job. Without me and my contacts, you would have rotten in jail. Now, tell me the truth. Did you enter this relationship just because I could give you protection? Why can't you answer? Is it because it's true? So, that's why... you never included me in your plans in life. You'll leave me once you're done using me, right? Would you come if I asked you to go to Bicol with me? But did you ask? You didn't. What if I really wanted to go? -But do you really want to? -My point is you didn't ask me. I'm asking you now, are you coming with me? No. What are you doing? If you'll leave me, do it now. Rosa... You want to go to Bicol, right? I won't stop you this time. You can leave right now. What's with you? I never said anything like that. My goodness! What's the meaning of this, Rosa? Why are you throwing Dado out? What are you fighting about? Your daughter's jealous because of a pregnant woman. I'm not. [car horn beeping] -[ominous music playing] -[dog barking] [car honks] Dado! Rosa! Hey, get dressed! We're eating out! It's Irma's birthday. Don't worry, it's my treat. ["Happy Happy Birthday (Sa'yo Ang Pulutan)" playing] ♪ Happy, happy, happy birthday ♪ ♪ The drinks are all on you The drinks are aplenty ♪ ♪ Happy, happy, happy birthday ♪ ♪ We hope That everyone's happy ♪ On behalf of our staff, we wish Ms. Irma a happy birthday. Happy birthday, darling. [woman] Wow! Looks delicious! Come on, let's eat. Go ahead. [man] Okay. -Go ahead and eat. -[Rosa giggling] Dear, go ahead and eat. [indistinct chatter] Stop asking for more food, you still have some left on your plate. [ominous music playing] [indistinct chatter] Dude, it's Jo. Stay there, and you sit here. [man] Looks good here. -[Irma] How about you? -Go ahead, here's more. I'll just go to the toilet. [Tiyong] Just stay here. [band music playing] Move it. -We have a lot of customers. -Almost done. -[man] Good evening, sir. -Good evening. [groaning] [band music playing] Dude, we'll go ahead. Rosa, let's go. Enteng. Mom, let's go. Sir? Waiter, the bill. -I'll just get it. -No need, I'll pay it now. Here you go. I left my holy statues. Wait, I'll just get them. [Rosa] Don't worry, Oca will come back and get them. [Rosa] Get in the car, Mom. [engine revving] [Enteng] Wait a second. I'll just get my cat. It might die in there. [Rosa] Hush, stop thinking about it. -[Azon] Don't worry about it. -Please, I won't take long. [Rosa] Stop it. [dog barking] [Enteng] It will feel sad if we leave. [Rosa] Go, make it quick. -[Dado] Hey, you're too loud. -[Rosa] Hurry. [Rosa] Faster. [ominous music playing] [indistinct chattering] Don't worry, it's peaceful here. He forgets to use his brain whenever he gets too hotheaded. I told you before, you can't hide from the law forever. We're not hiding from the law this time, we're hiding from Lupo. You're so irrational. -What I mean is-- -I know what you mean. But I'm only a high-school graduate, what job can I possibly have? I'm also a high-school graduate. But I didn't engage in prostitution or stealing in order for us to survive. Just give me a basket, and I'll sell anything I can. But if I do that, we'll be living from hand to mouth. It's better than this. We're like mice who keep on hiding anywhere. We're always hiding from the public. Don't worry, Mom. This is just temporary. [Rosa] Enteng. Enteng! Yes, Mommy? -You stubborn kid. -Ouch! Ouch! I told you not to wander too far. -[Azon] What's happening? -Get that damn cat out of here! Don't go too far. ["Sa Kidhat Mo" playing] [singing in Cebuano] [indistinct chatter] [man] Let's drink some more! [cheers] [man] Let's drink, guys! I feel ashamed because mom paid for this. She paid it for Boy. And his friend doesn't want to accept our payment for the rent, even if we're causing him trouble. [singing continues] How much money do you have left? Around 5,000 pesos. [laughs] I'm sure we'll get a few cash once Oca gets our things sold. [man 2] Eat some more! [singing continues] [Oca] Lupo took all your things in the house, Rosa. Nothing was left when I got there. Even your electric fan was gone. Damn it, that karaoke machine was a gift from Dado. Lupo asked me about you. I told him you went to Zamboanga. Do you think he'll buy that? He'll doubt it even more if I told him that you didn't flee town. I think it's better if you skip town, Rosa. We're out of cash. Go and leave Manila, Rosa. -How much are these? -[man] Five pesos. -How much is this? -Five pesos. I'll take one. [dog growling] [barks] -[caterwauls] -[barks] [gasping] Carnap! Carnap! Hey, Carnap. [ominous music playing] -Ah! -Hey! Hey! Hey! Mommy! Mommy! -What took you so long? -I saw Lupo. -Where? -At the market. -He saw you? -He did. Mom, go to the back of the house first. Enteng. Wait, my money. [knocking on door] Rosa. How are you? [Lupo] The case is not yet closed. Until now, the boss's killer is not yet identified. I have a suspect in mind, but I'd rather not tell the police. You have no proof. No one saw the person who killed the boss. -We don't know who did it. -Really? You really think you can fool me? But I don't want any trouble. Besides, the boss is already old. It was his time to retire. And now the real score is... Now that the boss is dead, I am now the new Tiyong, the new boss. Get it? The boss, and may his soul rest in peace, is too old-fashioned. He was contented with smuggling and its small return. He made up for it by increasing the volume. As for me, I want to operate occasionally, but with big returns. And for this business, I need the old crew. And what business is that? Kidnapping. So, are you in? How can we assure that you won't kill Dado if we join you? How can you assure that I won't kill him if you don't join us? Is that a threat? Rosa, in this business, I need the people that I've worked with before. Who else can I turn to aside from my old friends? Besides, we've been through a lot already. I'll consult this with Dado first. You know, all you have to do is control your boy and we'll get along just fine. [Dado] I don't trust that Lupo. You think after I killed his uncle, he'll just let it slide? Lupo is ambitious. But he doesn't have the balls. You saw how the old man treated him. I bet he's happy that someone killed his uncle for him. Lupo is a practical man, Dado. What will he get from killing you? Nothing. You'll just die without him getting anything from you. He needs us alive. Damn it. I thought we already turned our back on that Lupo. Dado, if we join Lupo on this, we'll be talking millions. Do you really want to be in hiding forever? [intense music playing] Here. Here's your car. No more hard feelings, okay? We both love Rosa, anyway. [chuckles] Get out of here. [screaming] -[man 1] Get down. -[man 2] You think you're tough? -[grunting] -[man 1] There. Get in. Let's go. [woman] Someone, call the police! Have you prepared the 20 million? I repeat, don't you dare tell the press nor the police about this, or else, we will kill your husband. Okay, let him go. Get out. [gunshot] What's that for? That's not part of the plan. It was the boss's order. Let's go. Shit. [sales agent] How many will be living in this house? [Dado] Uh... Five, including the maid. [sales agent] That's perfect. Our maid's quarters are over there. -[Dado] Where? -[sales agent] Over there. [Dado] So? Hmm... This will do. Mom will like it here because it has a balcony. [doctor] Ma'am, I'm taking off your patch. There. Now you can start opening your eyes slowly. I still can't see anything. [whirs] [indistinct chatter on TV] Dado, I have an idea. I said I have an idea. Mm. What is it? I have a new prospect, we can tell Lupo about it. And because it's our prospect, we deserve a bigger share. Who's your prospect? Your ex's daughter. Damn it, why Jing's daughter? Why not? Her husband is a millionaire. And didn't that woman hurt you? Aside from getting your revenge, we'll even get money out of it. Why does Lupo get to tag along? He might even kill the kid. Since it's our prospect, why don't we do it ourselves? We don't have a safe house. -What about Oca? -Let's not involve him. Lupo knows him. What about Boy Kulot? He's fit for the job. -Can we trust him? -I know him. I've worked with him a number of times already. -[screaming] -[Boy Kulot] Get out. -Sir, wait! -[screams] What are you going to do to the kid? -Shut up! -[Iris screaming] [grunting] Tell your boss to prepare five million. Don't tell the cops or else we will kill the kid. -[grunts] -I will. [muffled screaming] [Boy Kulot] We'll wait here. Let's ask Tantoco to put the money in two bags. We'll each take a bag. Just to make sure we don't get tailed. After getting the money, I'll split. When will we call them? Tomorrow afternoon. Let's make them sweat first. [chuckles] [suspenseful music playing] [music box playing] Please don't smoke around me. What? Smoking causes cancer. [chuckles] Who told you that? My daddy. -Do you love your daddy? -Yes. -Does he love you? -Yes. Yes, he does love you. [ship horn honks] Hello? This is Romy. Who's this? [Rosa] Listen carefully, Romy. Your daughter's with us and we need the money tomorrow. Tomorrow? Prepare two bags. -Romy, who's that? -One blue and one red. Put two million in the blue bag, and three million in the red bag. We don't have five million in cash. Five million? Romy, let me talk to them. Please. -Do not try to bid. -What about Iris? -What about Iris? -[shushes] -One million. Tomorrow. -I want to talk to Iris. What did he say? The bastard's negotiating. He's asking us to lower it to a million. Make it three million. Three million. Then do something about it! When? He says the banks are closed on Saturdays. What about Monday? [mumbles] Fine. All right, Monday at 1:00 p.m. Place the two million in the blue bag, and the remaining one million on the red one. Is that clear? Hey, man. Don't even try to dupe us. Or else your daughter will suffer. [music box playing] Come on, dinner's ready. It was my fifth month in jail when Elvis told me that Jing was pregnant. She was not yet married to Romy during that time. I can't see any resemblance of her face to Romy's. [Dado] Look. Look closely. She looks just like me, right? [Dado] Damn that Jing. She's depriving me from seeing my own daughter. Cut the drama. At least your daughter is in good hands under Romy's care. Come on, let's eat. I'm sorry, Iris June. Daddy just needs to earn money. [music box continues playing] [indistinct singing] [Dado] Three million. One million for Boy, and two million for us. Romy's really a cheap bastard. Never mind that, this is just a sideline, anyway. ♪ Near or far ♪ -♪ My love is for you only ♪ -You know, you're right. Iris is already in good hands. ♪ It appears and disappears ♪ Maybe you should give me a new child. What, another bastard child? No, thanks. Then let's get married. Really? You sure? One million? Crap. Romy had it mixed up. The two million is in Boy's bag. Then let's wait for him to come back. Are you sure we can trust him? -He wouldn't dupe us. -He better not. His cut from this job is only a million. -[Iris June crying] -It's been more than an hour. Daddy! Daddy! [Rosa] The kid. I'm sure Boy already ran off with our money. -What's wrong? -You said we could trust him? [Iris June] Daddy! [Rosa] We had a lot in mind for that money. This is only a million. -[Rosa] Stop crying. -This is only worth a new car. What about my mother's operation? Daddy! I knew we should have went to Oca for this job. At least I know I can trust him. -I said stop it! -[crying continues] I'm sorry, daddy's just worried. Boy? Dado, Boy's here. Boy. [chuckles] Damn. -What took you so long? -Ow! Hey. Who gives you a bath? Your mommy? -My nanny. -Your nanny? And who's your playmate? My mommy. You know, I also play a lot with my son. Enteng learned to play Lucky Nine when he was five. What's Lucky Nine? You don't know that game? It's easy. The name speaks for itself. -[bell jangling] -[indistinct chattering] [vendor] Sampaguita... They're here. -Wait. -Why? I'll do it. What time are they coming? It should be around this time. [engine starts] Dado, let's go. -Mommy! Mommy! -Iris! [Iris crying] [indistinct chatter on TV] What do you think, Dado? Let's go abroad. Let's go to Canada. [chuckles] Canada? ...when the ransom of three million pesos was paid. The child's father said one of the members of the kidnapping gang is a woman. The kidnap victim has already furnished the police a detailed description of the three kidnappers. Damn that Romy. He still went to the police. Hey, this is not our first time to be in the headlines. The public doesn't recognize us, anyway. But Lupo does. I don't know anything about that. [Jo] I told you about this a long time ago. Those two cannot be trusted. They like going solo. The problem is, boss, when they get caught, the Bureau might make them state witnesses. We'll all get in trouble. Sergeant... Would you like a side job? Enteng, here. When you get to Travesia, wait for Dado's brother-in-law. He will pick you up. [in Chabacano] Rosa, where are you and Dado going? [in Filipino] Don't worry about it, Mom. [sobbing] Stop worrying too much. Dado and I will come for you once things have cooled down. Try to avoid fighting with Dado. He's a good man. I know, Mom. Here. That's Dado's letter for his sister, Belen. Enteng. Enteng. Take care of this, it's your birth certificate. Your father's name is written on it. Atty. Palomo. Do you remember him? He's my father? Dado's here. Here are your tickets. -Don't lose them. -Let's go. Let's go so you can pick the good seats. Mom, I already asked Ador to watch over you. -[Dado] Ador. -[Ador] Over here. [Dado grunts] When you get to Travesia, Francis will pick you up. -Take care of them, will you? -[Ador] You got it. Rosa... Take care. We will, Mom. [sobs] Pray, okay? -Take care of Rosa. -[Dado] Yes, Mom. Enteng, don't fight with Belen's daughter, okay? Enteng? [sobbing] Stop crying. Man up. Take good care of your grandmother, okay? -Mommy? -What? Give me more money. You damn kid, you're so greedy. [indistinct chattering] -[bell ringing] -[train horn honking] Let's go. -Get in. -Why? Get in! [Dado] Sir, let's go back to the hotel. We left our tickets. Hurry. They got away but we're right behind them. I need backup. Dado, we don't have any weapon. [cat meows] Dado... Can't you go any faster? We might miss our flight. But we're already going too fast. Dado! Back it up. [Dado groans] Please get out of the car so you won't get involved in this. [grunting] Shit. [grunting] Dado, you're wounded. That's nothing. -[gunshot] -Ah! Get down! Dado. [tires screeching] [grunting] [gunshots] Damn it, Rosa! I said get down! [engine revs] [man] Let's go back. Move. [Dado] We got away. [laughs] Damn that was close. [chuckles] [Dado] Are you okay, Rosa? Huh? That Lupo thinks he can easily kill us. [Dado laughs] [gasps] Rosa! Damn it, Rosa. Hang on. I'll take you to the hospital. -[engine sputters] -[grunts, sobs] Not now, Rosa. We're still getting married. You can make it, Rosa! Damn it, hang on! [engine sputters] Crap! Rosa, don't leave me... Rosa... [Dado] Rosa... [Dado crying] Rosa, no... No... [gunshots] [gunshots] [man] Call the headquarters. Tell them we got them. -[cop 1] Get all the evidence. -[cop 2] Yes, sir!
