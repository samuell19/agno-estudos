I'm not a big boss. This may come as a surprise, but I really look up to you. You can't kick me out. You'd better drop the idea. Did you talk him into this? What a strange guy Senko brought him. At least let him save face. - Hiroshi is a full - fledged punk now. Sorry to ask,Sis, but can you give me some money? Don't come here for such things. What about school? No school in the afternoon. Seems like you're slacking off lately You need to try harder. I just raised some coffee money,no sweat. Hiroshi is acting like a big shot these days. You cheap bastard I'll raise you to 30! He ain't making a fool out of me! Take it easy now. You're still awake,Sis? From now on, if I come home late, you don't need to wait up for me. Been mixing with the wrong crowd recently? Are you up to something bad? Since when do you smoke? Have we eaten dinner together lately? When's the last time we had a nice chat at the end of the day? I'm not a kid anymore, you know. People know me as Lefty"Hiroshi one of Joji's men. I can be quite persuasive. I don't want you to turn out like that. I didn't work hard to bring up my little brother that way. Don't worry. I'm going into the ring soon. Then I'll make at least 20 yen per night. I'll get 15 yen even if I lose. It's not about the money! Have you ever made a woman cry? You already having girl trouble? She cried all night. I couldn't sleep. You bragging bastard! Who the hell is she? She's my sister. She keeps nagging. It's exhausting. I'm telling you, you should make a comeback. I told you. I have a gal who loves me. Someone insists on seeing you. A woman. Her voice doesn't sound familiar I'll go too. Maybe someone's using her as bait. Someone like“Iron Heart"Sada. Or“Mako"Kobayashi. Or“Eight Card"Seiko. No,it's nothing. I won't need help Excuse me.Are you Joji? Was it you who phoned? I'm Hiroshi's sister. Hiroshi has great respect and admiration for you. I think he'll do whatever you say But even so, he's still my little brother Please tell him to straighten himself out. You're wrong. It was his own decision. Then,can I at least see him? What sort of guy was it? You have a visitor Someone like“Eight Card"Seiko? Or“Mako"Kobayashi? It's no one special,like you guys. You should have told me. l ditched her Why not go home with her? You put Joji up to this,right? I'm worried about you. I had to do something. Give it up and go straight You'll never make it in this racket anyway You cheap bastard. I'll raise you to 40! Don't act so big, or Joji will beat you up! Don't threaten me. It's odd that he's so concerned about me. He isn't concerned about you. He's got a crush on your sister That one must have slipped by Tokiko! If I let every small thing bother me, I'd never make it in this racket. Find anything you like? - These fancy Red Seal 12 - inch classical records don't suit me. That's not true. You only pretend they don't suit you. Isn't it the same with everything else you do? Do you really understand that stuffy music,Joji? Look. Even a dog is listening. Music is among the better things God created. You've suddenly gotten dull. It's no use having him listen to music. It's me. What's the matter,losing your edge? I saw a love scene just now. Don't you care that an amateur has gotten the upper hand on you? I see.The news has already reached you. Senko says he'll slap some sense into her,too. The product is very delicate. Please handle it gently. You pushover. l ought to slap you. I heard something about you today. Cut it out. No use putting on airs with me. Don't you dare fool around with that. What if I do? I've done a lot of the dirty work helping you to save face. I want to talk to you about something. Will you come with me? May I ask what you're here for? I'm one of Joji's people. He's been very kind to me about my brother. That doesn't mean I'm your friend. Chances are,we're enemies. Don't you want to shoot me? Then I'll shoot you. I'm an idiot. I hate to say this, but I like you. Don't tell me you did something stupid. I understand why you fell for her. I've fallen for her too. I think I'll knit socks for you. I hope tomorrow will be a nice day. We should start getting up early. I've started feeling more domesticated since I met her. I don't want anything to do with this. I'm beginning to worry about your line of work You think I can't manage it? You think I can't be trusted? You won't need to do that anymore if we both cut back on expenses. You'll feed me by duping that sucker at your office? Quit joking around and think it through. I've never mentioned it until now. You may not understand. But... I can be that kind of girl,too. l admit it. I want to be nice like Kazuko. It's not like you! Don't you understand how I feel? What will you do if I don't? If you've got a problem with me, then leave! I'm just a delinquent anyway! I'm just a delinquent anyway! You comparing me with that girl? No thanks! Why are you so quiet? Are you upset? You had a fight,huh? I'll pay for this. In that case, give me ten glasses. You'll join me tonight,won't you? I want to take care of you. I'll be faithful. Do you think I'm worthy? I'm very foolish. I'm very selfish. I'm very extravagant. I don't even know how to do any housework. Well,do I surprise you? I like you because you're so frank. Won't you say yes? l think I'd better go. I'm back. Should I not have returned? I've been with the boss'son. He's very rich. He's quite a man. He's openhearted too. l like him. You jealous? Get jealous! Get jealous! Forget that girl! You're the only one I can count on. Love me more. Don't you pity me? Don't make me a miserable woman. Did my brother come here? I must see him. It's urgent. l thought maybe he had come here. I let him go. You saw me,didn't you? You've got some nerve to keep suspecting me. Why don't you tell the police? Or shall we try my usual joint? She's no delinquent. Speak to her kindly. l had to do that to get over her. Relax. We're thugs after all. Delinquents like you are just my type. But I want you to love me as a decent woman. Please don't laugh at me. Let's live honestly. We can't stay like this forever If anything happened to you... Tokiko,come over here! I'm going straight starting today! Did my sister come here? Can you lend me some money? I took money from her cash register. This and 200 yen more. We've spent almost all of it. Is that something to be proud of? Does that make you more of a man? Your sister is all you have! Please,hit me again! Leave! We'll do one last job. We must at least help Hiroshi. Who cares about them? We mustn't miss our chance. A man has a duty to perform. I've got to live up to mine. This was a gift from you,but... It's only an imitation. About the job... Promise it will be our last job. Then we'll go somewhere where nobody knows us. A place with plenty of sun, a nice lawn... Chirping birds... Flowers too. When we move, you'll get a steady job,too. You said you like me because I'm frank. I'm very extravagant. Catch my drift? Tell him to pay in cash. You'd better not waste your money Well,do I surprise you? You go home first and get ready to run. \Your sister loves you. Be nice to her. Your brother loves you. Be good to him. Don't just sit there! 大 Maybe we should get arrested. Then we can start over CLUB HAMIGAKI TOOTH POWDER Do you really think we can get away like this? A new life is waiting for us,right? AJoji,let's give up. Let them catch us. We'll only serve a few years. You can get arrested if you want,not me. As you wish! Are you selling me out? I'm sorry.Forgive me. Please think about our future happiness. Or we'll have to keep running all our lives! We're still young. If we'd lived honest lives from the start.. we would have found happiness sooner. A few years won't be too long. Don't you understand how I feel? Please don't think ill of me. - This is good - bye for now. Come over here! THE END
