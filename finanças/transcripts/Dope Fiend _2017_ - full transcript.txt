Never have we had a recession this deep with a recovery this flat. Gentrification's detractors will tell you that rising rents and increased property values force out locals and small businesses from affected neighborhoods. Proponents say the influx of new residents and businesses is worth celebrating. What gentrification really is, it is the increase in the price of land. It is a shortage of neighborhoods and the thing about Canada and the US is that we stole this land fair and square and we got a lot of it, we don't have a shortage of land, we have a shortage of walkable urban land. Federal guidelines allow Public Housing authorities to evict whole families because of a family member's alleged criminal activity. God, God! Baby. Please, somebody help.

What? Bed-Stuy is the next area to start on now. That's where Prince comes in. We need to escalate our efforts. I don't want to know what or how you do what you do. I just need you to hurry it up and start to get them out one by one. What about the new people coming in? We are going to need people to fill those units until we are ready. I'm taking care of that. Well, I can speed it up on a few fronts. I've already started on one. How much time do I have? Two years, the new mayor will be in by then. Hey, hey. Wait a minute, you finish your homework? Who finished their homework? So get in there and finish it. My goodness, what's wrong with ya? Sandra. Sandra. Bobby, Bobby, where is Sandra? - She went to the store. - For what? I don't know. Anyway, when she gets back, you tell her I want her to put Instagram on my phone. My whole life. My whole life... I've been watching kids. It is really simple. Williamsburg is the only area in the whole country that was not affected by the housing crash. In fact, during that time, it actually grew. So, the area around it... Bedstuy is next in line. Soon all five boroughs will be gone. We are sitting on ground zero. My associate has a large share in Brooklyn and is willing to team up with us for a price. Ultimately gentlemen, what we get is a huge slice of Brooklyn. So, if we bring in 100 ki's a week, we'll be able to destabilize the neighborhood. What we do is we flood it hard, then we pull out. After that we call the police with the help of our friend. Now we have the cash and the property is ready for us to take at a lower price. I'm not worried about the niggas, I'm worried about the Jews and if they gonna do what they say they gonna do. As long as the money is right, we are all right with them.

Okay, I'll come back in five minutes. - Thank you. - What's wrong? I told you I didn't see him. I just wanted to say thank you. I thought I lost you on the ride over here. It was the longest 20 minutes of my life. I appreciate everything that you've done for me, for us, the whole family. I'm grateful. So I just... I just had to say thank you. I know you do. I want all y'all to make it in this world, I don't judge you. We always find a way to live. You know I was thinking... do you ever think about the fact that your daddy died from drugs, your mama died... from drugs and the whole family is either... on drugs or selling them? My daddy was killed by the cops. Because he was on drugs. What do you think will happen if you go around stealing just like that boy with them ugly orange sneakers who tried to rob me? The police gonna catch up with him too. I'm not trying to run your life or tell you what to do with your life. I stopped believing in God a long time ago right after your grandaddy was killed by the police. I came to New York... to be someone... to buy my mother a house. But when I got up here... and had kids... life happened. Come on Grandma, you can't just sit up here and play the victim. You got seven kids and you tellin' me life just happened? You ever stop and think that at some point maybe you had something to do with the fact that all seven of your kids turned out the exact same way? My mother was a sharecropper down South. She wasn't educated... I wasn't educated much... and I ain't had no daddy. By the time I learned about life... I was a grandmother. You damn right. Don't let life happen to you. Make life happen... for you. Yo I was fuckin' with these bitches last night. Bitch talkin' about she wanted to blow on a Tootsie-Roll and shit, man. Who the fuck is these niggas, man? - Come on. You don't fuck up. - What? Shit. Tell Profit we're looking for him. Yo, Herb, man, I gotta get outta here, man. All right, I got you right now. Hey Profit, I'm glad I ran into you. Check this out, I just printed out the proposal for the Center. Damn Black, you serious about this? Yeah. You gonna have a basketball team too? Yeah, yes. But more importantly, we're gonna teach the little ones about us.

I don't need to fuckin' read, I can count. You know what, maybe that is a good idea. You know, it's about time you put your money behind something worthwhile instead of putting it behind rappers and other BS. You know what, and now maybe you can go back to school and get your GED. That's dope. Yo, I wanna talk to you a little bit more about me gettin' bumped up, because I was talkin' to a man about that shit and he was buggin' out on me.

There has been a major gang roundup by the NYPD. Organized Crime Control B-- Bureau, Narcotics Division and also the Public Housing Police were very familiar with many of these suspects and had been aware of their activities.

I'm waiting on my dad, he said he taking me fishing today. It's too late to go fishing. Y'all should've left by this morning. Well I've been here since this morning but maybe we're leaving tonight to sleep over and start early in the morning. Besides it is Bear Mountain, and it is a long ride. You know me and your dad are like brothers, right? Your grandmother and my mother are like sisters. In fact, I'm the one that gave you that name, Profit. You know why? 'Cause I ain't never seen a boy that can add like you. I always did go to the store for everybody and some people would tell me to keep the change. So when you goin' for everybody, I had to know how much change I could keep and how much change I could give back. I guess so. It's gettin' kinda late. I don't think your dad is coming, son. Besides, you ain't hungry? It's dinnertime. He said he was coming. He promised. He gave me his word, he swore to God. Look, Profit, I'm gonna have to tell you something. You may not understand this, but I hope when you get older, you remember it. Your father is no longer your father. He done got hooked on them drugs and all he knows is those drugs. The man... who was your father... he died a long time ago. Only God can bring him back. So now I need you to be a man and take care of your family... your grandmother, your sister, your cousins, they need you. You do what you gotta do to take care of your family. You choose to live and die by your terms. They need you to lead them.
