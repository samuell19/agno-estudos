DIFFICULT YEARS A CIVILISED POPULATION'S BEST QUALITY IS THE ABILITY TO LAUGH AT ITS FAULTS This is Sicily. This noble, ancient land under a sky flooded with light that has such a severe, melancholy appearance. These are its towns, which have grown over the centuries with none of the cold geometry of a rational metropolis. They are warm with life, like plants that have coiled around a volcano, or sprung up on the hill where the first seed was sown. The people who live in these towns, full of steps and courtyards, full of windows, terraces and balconies, have drawn from their 1000 years of experiences, misfortunes and efforts, that profound, elemental genius known as common sense. The most humble men in these squares are virtually unknown and they don't enjoy people's regards, but they lovingly preserve a sense of justice and truth and suffer greatly when this is harmed or attacked. One of these, a poor clerk, who lived in those difficult times, is the protagonist of this story. His name was Aldo Piscitello, and he lived in this house. Walking around with no shoes on! Then you complain your teeth hurt. You traitor! Thank goodness. And you watch where you're going. - Me first! - No me! - No, I'm first. - No! HINDEMBURG IS DEAD. HITLER BECOMES REICH CHANCELLOR AND PRESIDENT. - Guess who's dead. Cavaliere Percolla. - Which Percolla? - The one they called "Fatso". - Poor man. Let me see. Yesterday 2nd August 1934 at 4pm, comforted by his religion, Cavaliere Domenico Percolla passed away. Poor man. - Granddad, it's busy. - The kids are in there. Oh, she's finally done it! Well, what are you waiting for? Get up. You can't stay in bed all day. It's your fault, you stay up so late. You go to bed in the small hours. - It's not true! - Yes it is. If only you were reading school books. Instead of all that stupid stuff. How will you become a teacher like that? What will you teach the kids? "Pisanello, the Perfumed Death". What a load of nonsense! - Come on. Get up. - Who's eaten all the egg? You scoundrel! At your age! What's the matter? He ate all the egg I made for Elena. He's worse than those two. - What will I give the poor girl now? - I'm going to the office. Yes, you wash your hands of it and I have to put up with everyone! Mr Piscitello! There's a postcard from your son from Perugia. He says he's on manoeuvres, it's baking hot but he's fine and says hello to all. Thank you. - Aren't you going to read it? - You've just read it for me. - Good morning, Nicola. - Good morning. Staying in bed in the morning burns this one's backside! - Mr Piscitello... - Do you think I am a machine? - Be patient. - What do you mean, patient? I'll call you when it's ready! - Piscitello! - What's the matter? The Podest? wants you. - Me? - Yes, you. Right away. - Where you going? - Come back tomorrow. - Tomorrow? - We can't wait! I'm not moving from here! Come on, hurry up. The Podest? is waiting. 18 carriages have been stuck in Messina for a week, understand? Don't give me the usual excuses. The Prince's go through, don't they? The truth is that you're a gang of "mafiosi"! They were going bad? What about my oranges? Do you think they're made of stone? I'll report your anti-patriotic behaviour to Rome, you bunch of swines! Ah, Piscitello. You, too. - You've been causing trouble. - Me, Baron? Precisely! You're not a member of the Fascist party, are you? Me? No, Baron. And you're looking at me like that? I have to sack you because of it. Oh, dear God! Don't act like that. I have to follow orders as precisely as possible, because there's a lot of moral corruption here. Of course, I'm very sorry that you, my old clerk... For 21 years, sir. ...and my tenant... I was born in your building. I know. Basically, you have to join the Fascist party. But sir, the membership lists are closed. What do you mean "closed"? There's always a way. Talk to the party secretary in some village. Explain your situation. Say that... But do I really have to tell you what to do? I understand, but I... I've never been involved in politics. You're right... But if I could, I wouldn't... You know there are ex-ministers who would give their right arm to be a member of the party! Do you despise the Fascist Party? Sir, the Duce is God and I, with all due respect, am a piece of shit, but I've never been involved in politics. Bye, Piscitello, see you tomorrow. Then you'll tell me if you prefer to keep your job or find another one. So what do you want to do? Join up. We'll tell Cavaliere Annibale, leader of the party in Pedara. He's a friend and a bit of a relative. - He'll help you. - Rosa, I'm not a Fascist. - Well, become one! - Become one, become one... Why do I have to become a Fascist? What do they want with me? Dad, you don't half go on! - Where's he going? - Who knows. - When the British Ambassador... - Piscitello! - Good evening. - Come in. Sit down. - Sorry, I need to talk to the chemist. - Is someone at home not well? - No, they're all fine. - Come round the back. - Please, excuse me. - Carry on. - I don't want to... - Piscitello? He wouldn't hurt a fly. The British Ambassador sees that two people have thrown themselves out of the window on Mussolini's order. "Holy Mary Mother of God" he says, "who's this Big Cheese?" - Sir, could you come here a moment. - Excuse me. What is it? Then they call a young man. "Ah, this one's not old like the others", thinks the Ambassador, "He's still got to sew his wild oats, he won't be too happy about dying. " "Young man", says Mussolini, "see that window? Take a running jump out of it!" The young man prepares to jump, but the Ambassador grabs him. "Hey! Do you know what will happen if you jump out of that window?", he says. "You'll lose your life!" The young man replies: "And you call this living?" And he throws himself out. Stone dead! It's a good one, isn't it? - Mascari, come here a moment please. - Yes. Excuse me a moment. - Of course. - What's going on? - Something private. Lawyers' business. - God protect me from lawyers, - and I'll avoid the doctors! - Doctor, you come too. But why all these secrets? Why are they acting like that? - Come here, you two come as well. - What's going on? Things... things... come here. Who is it? Ah, Mr Sebastiano Caputo. To what do we owe the pleasure? I was just passing. I hoped I could find someone to chat with. I'm sorry I can't help you. I'm completely alone, and I've got a complicated prescription to make up. Well, if that's how it is... - I won't disturb you further. - Oh, please. You never disturb me. - Damned spy! - We should kill him like a rat. With a stick, so that we don't dirty our shoes. He's gone. Maria, come down here a moment. So what should I do? It's hard to say, dear Piscitello. This is a question that goes beyond an individual case. It's something rooted in history. Do you agree? I couldn't have put it better myself. "A problem that is rooted in history. " In any case, how can we advise you? The ideal would be to resist, to fight. Only when individuals join, can we achieve collective strength to bring down a dictatorship. But we'd need the combined strength of the people - and unfortunately... - I understand what the lawyer's saying, but it's not our fault that this joint action hasn't happened. I'm not insinuating anything. You're too touchy. Dear lawyer, I can repeat your speeches at the '21 elections by heart, when you couldn't speak badly enough of the church and its ministers. I wanted to attack its unworthy representatives, not the institution. Gentlemen! Forget the past. What's the point in talking about past mistakes? Excuse me, we're not here to discuss responsibility, we're here to clarify... Don't say clarify! It's a word that only causes disaster, It's by clarifying that we've ended up in this darkness. Darkness? It's more like the Middle Ages! Excuse me, what do you think I should do? Right. Listen, you have to decide. You and you alone, understand? - Yes, ok, but I... - Do what you're able, dear friend... Follow your heart. - Of course, the ideal thing would be... - But how can a man in his situation... - Want some advice? You decide! - Yes, that's it. I should decide? Oh, I see. I understand. Thank you very much. - Yes, but dialectics... - Oh, don't start! - Good evening, Mr Piscitello. - Good evening Maria. I got a letter from Giovanni in Perugia. Yes? Me too. A postcard. My son must have more to say to you. - Good evening. - Mr Piscitello! - Are you worried about something? - Oh, it's nothing. Good evening. You don't love me! If you did you'd come out on the landing for 5 minutes. Two minutes? One? You don't love me. I love love itself. - Love is perdition and exaltation. - Yes, but come out for a second. Your mouth is hungry. - You have the eyes of a demon. - Just a second! Solitude must clasp my thighs like a cilice. What's all this cilice? You don't understand. No one understands me. Oh, it's my dad! - No, it's the judge on the 2nd floor. - No, no, it's my dad! - Oh, see you tomorrow night. - Bye! - Good evening, Mr Piscitello. - Good evening, little baron. - What time is it? - Time to stop! If I catch you acting stupid with the baron's son one more time, I'll tear you in half like this rubbishy novel! - Well, have you decided? - I don't want to talk about Mussolini! - The trains run on time now. - They can do what they want! - There's order... - Who's saying there isn't? Do you remember when the Communists booed you because you had sweets... - They belonged to the Baron. - I like what he does for young people. - Well, really I... - The youth are all crazy for Mussolini. People who are far better than you or I say Fascism is great! But I never said anything different! - Listen... goodnight! - Goodnight. Do you know what Don Calogero said? That il Duce was sent by Providence. Do you want to defy Providence itself? - What is it? - But... But what? How much money the party secretary in Pedara will want? Let me take care of that. Who knows what his wife said to the party secretary in Pedara, but one week later Aldo Piscitello was wearing the Fascist party badge- - Good morning, Mr Piscitello! - Good morning. Is there any post? - Sorry, but there's no post today. - What is it? Oh, nothing. I'm sorry, I didn't know that you too... Yeah, me too. With the same dedication he showed in his job as a clerk for 20 years, Piscitello fulfilled his duties as a party member- He wore his black shirt when told to, and attended area meetings- He carried the heavy banner of the 23rd March group in parades- And despite his dodgy heart, he never failed to take part in training- On Saturday evening he returned home exhausted, with aching feet- Give the Roman salute! Dad, dad! I'll be back right away. - Why's dad dressed like that? - He joined the Fascist party. - What's so strange? Didn't you know? - No, I didn't. - Rosina! - What is it? - What's the matter? - I can't get these damned boots off. - It's all your fault. - All this over a pair of boots! - Pull. - I am pulling! - What do you want? - Who's he? - Giovanni. - Giovanni! Who's Giovanni? Granddad, Giovanni. My brother. Your son's son! - My son? - Uff! Let me look at you Giovanni. Is it me or do you look thinner? No, I'm just a bit tired. The manoeuvres are very hard. Ah, yes, of course. Sit down here next to me. I've so much to say to you... When things happen, I always think: "I must tell Giovanni when he returns. " And now, I can't remember anything. Never mind. How are things at the Council? Well, not bad. I'll tell you later. But let's talk about you. Will you stay here with us? Or are you like those who go looking for who knows what on the Continent? If I find a job I'll stay here, in this old place full of heat and mosquitoes. But I prefer them to the fog of Parma or Milan. And you're here. So are my friends. These old roofs... And she's here. Have you seen her often? I don't go to the chemist's often. I need to tell you about how... ...how I signed up. There's no need, dad. - I'm going out. - Where are you going? - To the rehearsals for "Norma". - You're a singer now? Don't be silly, dad. It's Bellini's 100th anniversary. The students have got walk-on parts. Go to bed, or I'll give you "Norma"! - To bed! Or I'll give you a... - Let her go dad. You've no idea. This idiot's been making eyes at the Baron's son. And your mother, who's getting more and more stupid, thinks: "well, why not? There's no harm, you never know. " So? What's so strange? What if Elena became a baroness one day? Listen to her! You don't see that times have changed. Social differences have been abolished. - Yeah, you'll believe anything. - Calm down, dad. No sir! I may dress like an undertaker outside, but I'm still the boss here. There's nothing new in this house, and no one goes out without my say so! Good evening madam, we've come to take Elena to rehearsals. How kind! We were waiting for you. She's the party representative. - Good evening to you all! - Good evening. - Sublime! - Bellini's worth ten of Verdi! Oh, look who's back! - Good evening. - Our dear Giovanni. Come in. Sit down. - This is Piscitello's son. - Ah! Piscitello... He's at university with my niece. He's just finished his military service. - Are you in the Engineers? - Yes. Great! Wonderful soldiers. They fought bravely on the Isonzo and the Piave. How is it going in the army? - Please, tell us. - I play a very minor role. - I really couldn't say. - You can say what you want here. What's there to say? How are relations between the army and the Fascist militia? Right, how is it? I've never had anything to do with those in the militia. Great! "Those in the militia"! I've never heard anything about them. So is it true there's a complete breakdown in relations? They hate them. The soldiers refuse to salute them. - Is that true? - There's continual conflict. - The situation's getting worse. - I don't think so. Ah, as an officer you're very wise to reserve judgement. Good evening, Giovanni. Miss Maria! - How could you? - I wanted to surprise you. - When did you get back? - This evening. My love. 18 months. How long they were. But now they're over. Yes, they're over. Chaste goddess, Chaste goddess, who bathe... - Ah, those were the days. Italy was a land of flowers, of music and song. It was all kindness, courtesy and respect for others. But now, today... Enfold the earth in that sweet peace, Enfold the earth in that sweet peace, which, through Thee, reigns in heaven- Which, through Thee, reigns in heaven- When God, in his dark anger, Shall demand the Romans' blood, "The Romans' blood"? What kind of an opera is this? I don't know. I thought that this was a work in praise of Rome. If only we knew what this is about. - Don't you know this work? - No, I'm not from here. Perhaps the Podest?... Podest?, do you know the story of this work? To tell you the truth, I never know what's going on in operas. And first to fall before our wrath shall be the Proconsul of Rome- They've got it in for Rome! Has the Censor seen this opera? I don't know. Ah! Bring back to me the beauty of our first love. Then, against the world itself I shall be your defence. - Hey, where's your badge? - I forgot it. - Go get it! - Now? Right away. And in that love I shall find again life, fatherland and heaven itself! - Piscitello, Piscitello! - Who is it? Ah, Podest?. Find the theatre director. Tell him to bring the libretto for "Norma". Hurry! Yes, but where is he? I don't even know... On the stage. Go, hurry! - Excuse me, where's the director? - There he is. Where are you going? - The director? - That's me. The Podest? wants the libretto. - Why? - I don't know. But he seems angry. This libretto must have been written by an anti-Fascist. - It was written 100 years ago! - I don't care. - We have to change everything. - But how? Like this. Give me a pen! Cut out everything that attacks Rome. Oh, this is madness! "On a mortal page, I read the name of proud Rome. " I always said that intellectuals were dirty Fascist haters. - Did you get the badge? - No. WE WILL MARCH FORWARDS BELIEVE, OBEY AND FIGHT There is great expectation amongst the crowds- Thanks to its great leader, Italy is about to enter an era of greatness never seen in its history. The windows are opening- A cry goes up- There! It's him! A sight for sore eyes, a white shirt. Are they in there? - Yes. - Excuse me. What a thing to see! What a thing. Close that door there! - Lots of people in the square? - Uh-huh. The Baron has offered me a job in his factory. He had a vacancy. Is it a good job? Yes, it's very interesting. And the wages aren't bad. - No need to worry about our future. - Our future... - What is he saying? - Who cares? - Who cares up to a certain point. - Exactly. Up to a certain point. - I'll go and listen. - I'll play. I can explain. Looks like there's not much to explain. A chair, a chair. Get a chair! Close that door first of all. No chairs. Put her on the floor. - What happened? - She was crushed. She wanted to listen. She loves the Duce. Oh, really? There's no need. I'll take care of it. Duce! Uncle! What are you doing? - What's going on? Aren't we eating? - I'm going, I'm going! Cooking on a day like this! I never heard Cavour speak, but it would take plenty of him to make one Mussolini. What was that phrase about destiny turning the wheel? Ah, it was lovely. Wonderful! D'Annunzio never came up with a phrase like that. D'Annunzio's a great poet, but he's not so multi-talented as Mussolini. Not so multi-talented as him! Mum! I've got some great news! - About Ethiopia? - Not that. Dad? He's getting changed. What's going on? - Hang on, I'll help you. - Call your mum. It's her fault. Let me do it, I'm used to it. Pull! Guess what? Today I got engaged to Maria. - It's here, it's here! - What is it? - The postcard's here. - Have they called you up? I wish! It's for him. - For me? - Unfortunately yes. I hoped it was for me, but... - What have you got to do with it? - What have I got to do with it? Full of Fascist spirit, Italian ships prepare to depart for East Africa. Sorry I couldn't come earlier, dear. I had the party secretary to lunch. Germany rises once more under the leadership of the Fuhrer. A great military parade with 300,000 Germans- I heard you've asked to leave as a volunteer. What a scene my parents caused! My father found out and told my mother. - So you're not going? - Unfortunately not. The British Lion can't stop the advance of Mussolini's new army, who having crossed the Suez Canal, disembark in fought-over Africa. - My brother said it's very hot there. - Where? - In Massawa. - He's so lucky! A Belgian strategist says the war in Ethiopia will last six years. - Six years! - Yes. Perhaps he's wrong. Don't you know that Belgian military strategists are the best in the world? - Why? - Because they're the best in the world. I've got some great news! - What is it? - Tell us! - They've had it! - Out with it! - They've substituted De Bono. - So the Belgian strategist was right! - Who've they substituted him with? - With Badoglio. - They say he's good. - Yes, he's great. But what can you do? They're compromised. Soon the rains will come, and then a big typhoon... My dear Piscitello, I understand your worries. They are those of thousands of fathers, wives and children. But we didn't send your son there. You know who it was, don't you? How like Giovanni you are. How? Just like him. You don't want to bother others with your problems. Come here, Mr Piscitello. Sit here next to me. Listen, I know you often think we're cynics, that we're know-alls... - No, no... - No, that's how it is. It's natural. They talk about our great nation, our place in the sun, about proletarian Italy and empire. But we speak the language of reason and condemn military aggression. It's obvious that what we say is less attractive. But I realise that sir. What I'm saying is, wouldn't it be better not to whisper it as if we were at confession, but to shout it out loud, even if we end up in prison? Of course, it would be the ideal thing, but... - Here we go, look... Sanctions! - Let me see! "The Geneva Council has decided to apply economic sanctions to Italy. " The Italian representative protested strongly. That's it! - What? - The war's over! - Why? - Because to wage war you need canons, to make canons you need steel and we haven't got any! Britain will close the Suez Canal and the U.S. Won't send any more petrol. It's over and, God willing, so is Fascism. That's why we don't go and shout? - I understand. - It's so simple. If we listen to the voice of reason this should cheer us up. Italy will manage with a broken nail, but if Africa had been a success, who knows where we'd be with that maniac! A broken nail. I hope this nail isn't my son, or anyone else's. - What a day? - Wonderful. - Anyone there? - What do you want? I have a prescription for this medicine. - They don't have it in my village. - Which one? - It's eme... It cures amoeba. - Emetine. - The doctor says it works. - So they say. - How do you take it? - One injection every two days. - Thank you. I kiss your hand. - I kiss your hand. The moon is in the sky and you shine on the earth. You are a woman of rare beauty who shines like a lantern, over a boat at night on the sea. Inside your breast the nightingale dwells. An angel laughs through your mouth. Beauty, created for eternal life, you make dried-up trees flower again. Ah, great, well said, lawyer! - Go on, dad. - I'd like to say, that today my heart is beating fast, as fast as when I was sixty, and I felt like a young lad. It's beating hard for this dear couple, who I wish all the best. They wrote it for me! Now, with the fianc?e's permission, I'll kiss his girlfriend. No, it's the other one! - Congratulations! - There's a great view from the window. - Really? Let's go and have a look. - Ah, how wonderful! I've come to wish the couple all the best. Thank you, Baron. And I'm happy to say that tomorrow Giovanni will be a part of my factory. Yours is the nicest present. We have to work, dear Giovanni. We have to industrialise this island that the Duce has called "the heart of the Empire. " I'm sorry I have to leave, but I have to see the party secretary. I wish you all the happiness, you're both good and attractive. - When are you getting married? - In two months. - Come here, just a second. - Oh, good God... And this will be their bedroom, lovely isn't it? Yes, but sleeping in one room all your life with a woman gives me a sense of oppression. - You didn't feel like that once! - But now I'm convinced, you're right. Solitude must grasp our thighs like a cilice. The truth is you don't love me anymore. - Careful. You're loud! - What does it matter now? - What are you talking about? - Do you still love me? Yes, I love you. I love you. This year has been exceptionally good. - The only problem is transport. - Do you export a lot? We're reacquiring markets that we had lost. When there were sanctions, the Spanish took over. They've got other things to worry about now. Things are getting serious there. - What, you send oranges to Spain? - These are a special type of orange. They don't grow there. My dear, come, I want to show you our chemical plant. You'll find it a bit untidy. Your predecessor wasn't very competent. Luckily though he's been nominated Undersecretary for Justice. - Undersecretary? - He's the party secretary's nephew. - Oh, I see. - All the best with your work. We'll be seeing each other often here. And if you need anything, ask engineer Fieschi. He's in charge of everything in here. - Goodbye. - Thank you, Baron. You bunch of idiots! I don't believe it. What have you done? Get out of here! Look what they've done! Take note. Lieutenant Giovanni Piscitello, son of Aldo. Destination: Unknown. Wait, I'll turn the light on. It's lovely. I'd prepared everything. I'd have moved to the second floor so as not to disturb them. But... But now a red card, with "destination unknown". They use a man like a puppet and send him to the devil. To other countries, to cause death. Not Giovanni. He's in the anti-aircraft division. Try and look cheerful, for the girl's sake. - What does she say? - Nothing. She doesn't say a word. She'salways calm, serene. But the light's on in her room until late. - She writes to him. - Right. Cursed be the day that... - Good chinaroot. - It's that spy. And as I was saying, I went on holiday and it cured me completely. - Good evening. - Good evening. I was just passing and I stopped by for a chat with your niece. Give us two glasses of chinaroot too, Maria. We kiss you hand, doctor! - Who are they? - Your tenant in Pedara, Rocco's sons. Now I remember. - What are you doing here? - We came to see you. Our father said: " If you go through Modica, say goodbye to the chemist. - "He won't let you go empty handed. " - Where are you going? Far away, sir. We're going to war. In Spain. - Have you been called up? - No sir. We're volunteering. Volunteering? Why? Well, sir. You'll do anything if you're hungry. There's no work and the land doesn't produce enough to feed the animals. Once, we could go to America, like my uncle, but where do you go today? In Spain they give us 40 lire a day plus food, and, God willing, we'll come home alive with a bit of money. If not, it's His will. Good evening. Here, give it to them. Thank you. We kiss your hand. Riccardo! Riccardo! - What's up? - I was waiting for you. - You promised... - There was a meeting. What is it? I'm so unhappy. - Why? - You don't love me anymore. Oh, what silliness. - You don't love me. - Of course I still love you. You see, a man can't spend all day making eyes. - I'm very worried at the moment. - Why? - I want to become a pilot. - A pilot? Yes, and go to Spain to fight, like your brother, but my mother will die if I start flying. Me too, I'd die too. Don't start as well. What will happen if you leave me alone? - Your father! - No, it's the judge. No, it's your father! - See you tomorrow evening. - Yes, bye. Today at 3pm there was a meeting... - - Get up you, I have to make the bed. - Every day the same thing! - There's no peace in this house. - Shut up you two! The bombardiers have performed a brilliant raid on Valencia- A large number of highly explosive devices were dropped on the port - and on the industrial area- - Good! Great! This is the end of our programme- And you call yourself a Christian? You make the sign of the cross, but you're happy if they bomb children and women who are better than you! What's important is we win. I'm sure you're not even happy that Italy's winning. Italy? This isn't Italy. It's a band of adventurers. Defeatist! What's this thing? It's the Fascist squad uniform with the March on Rome scarf. - And whose is it? - Yours. Me, a squad member? Don't you know? There's a 2,000 lire prize for squad members. And what's that got to do with me? You've been a member of the Pedara party since March 1921. Wait a minute? Why is the Pedara Party secretary organising this? - Why is he doing this? - Why? Because he's taken pity on a family in difficulty. You give that man the party card and the 2,000 lire back. - The 2,000 lire? - What did you do with it? I spent it on you, your children, your father and on me! Yes, I bought myself the first pair of new shoes in three years. END OF PART ONE PART TWO 27TH SEPTEMBER 1938 THE SUDETENLAND BECOMES PART OF THE THIRD REICH What do you think Lieutenant sir, will there be a war? What do you want me to say? Let's hope not. Sit down. - Where were you injured? - In Guadalajara, in Spain. - In Guadalajara. What was your job? - A tailor. I only need one leg. Oranges! - Giovanni! - Maria! You haven't changed a bit. - You have, though. - For the worse? - No, you're just more serious. - The war makes you more serious. - What are you doing here? - I left as soon as I got your telegram. I didn't want to wait in Modica. I've been sitting here since this morning. Special edition! The Duce in Munich! Meeting in Munich! Special edition! The Duce arbiter of world peace! They declare war and he wants peace, but when there's peace he wants war. THE DUCE HOPES FOR A NEW EUROPE MUSSOLINI, HITLER, CHAMBERLAIN AND DALADIER MEET IN MUNICH - Let's hope they come to an agreement. - Let's hope so. - Was it terrible there? - Pretty bad. You never wrote about what you were doing. War is the same everywhere. And when you come back there's only one thing you want to do: Forget. - Is everyone well at home? - Yes, they're all fine. Elena got her diploma. Nen? and Pep? have gone. - Gone? - Yes, to Rome. - To the Farnesina Academy. - Nobody told me. What an idea, the Farnesina Academy! Perhaps it's more important to learn gymnastics than get a degree. - Is your uncle ok? - Not bad. He has liver problems. - And his friends? - They're still there. They say the same thing, that everything's getting worse. It's hard to say anything different. But you can't spend your life complaining. We don't live long and we have to take life as it comes, whether it's good or bad. I wasted such a lot of time saying "yessir" to generals and corporals. I've had enough. I want to think of us now. Just us. The family is a living temple! Woe betide he who profanes it. You two are lucky enough to create it in a prosperous, happy Italy, the arbiter of world peace. And in this peace, which will be long, fruitful and holy, with God's blessing and help, you will do your holy duty. 15th March 1939, German troops occupy Bohemia and Moravia- On 29th March, Madrid surrenders- On 1 st September, German tanks invade Poland- On 3rd September, the UK and France declare war on Germany- On 20th September, Italy declares non-aggression- On 27 th, Warsaw surrenders, after heroic, but fruitless resistance- On 9th April 1940, at dawn, Nazi troops invade Denmark and Norway- On 10th, they are in Holland, Belgium and Luxemburg- The Maginot Line is outflanked- Holland surrenders after 5 days- Belgium after 18 days- On 30th May, the British expeditionary force manages to escape destruction, and retreat across the Channel. The French army suffers heavy losses. On 10th June German tanks are in sight of the Eiffel Tower. And the same day... - What will he say, sir? - Something very prudent. He doesn't want a strong Germany. He's not stupid. - So it won't be a war speech. - No, on the contrary. Combatants, soldiers, sailors and aviators! An hour appointed by destiny has struck in the heavens of our fatherland- Sir... The hour of irrevocable decisions- The declaration of war has already been delivered to the ambassadors of Great Britain and France. We go to war against the plutocratic, reactionary democracies of the West. People of Italy! Rush to take up arms! And show your tenacity, your courage, your valour! France... France, our sister. Cowards! I haven't come to arrest you. - Go away! - What is it? - Lt. Colonel Giovanni Piscitello? - That's my son. Then I'll leave this with you. ROYAL ITALIAN ARMY - How's it going? - Same as usual. What great victories! We are conquering the world! It's only a matter of days for France. Do you know when the US have promised them help? In 1943! The party's secretary told me. 1943! What can we do? We have be patient. I'm about to lose my patience! - Someone could hear. - Let them go to hell. You tell him to be careful. - God protect you. - Try not to annoy dad. Maria. I'm really leaving you alone this time. - Your uncle's not even here. - Don't worry. You'll be back soon and so will my uncle. Goodbye, my dear! Careful, careful. Goodbye. - Goodbye, Giovanni. - Goodbye. Giovanni! Goodbye! And didn't it make you ashamed? Didn't it make you want to vomit, being so closely related to such a dirty, anti-Fascist traitor? But I don't understand. You don't? Who married her? My son? The niece of that disgusting chemist, Platania! But the girl has a heart of gold. I don't give a... A girl brought up in that nest of vipers marries your son, a brave soldier of the Fascist Fatherland. Look, the chemist is an old hothead... You want to defend that disgusting creature! Don't you hope he's dragged in front of a special tribunal? This is what he wanted! This is what our enemies told him to do, to create a scandal in this proud Fascist town, of which I'm party secretary! But he can forget it, by God! We'll send him into political confinement, like any other scoundrel. Well said, secretary. He should go into confinement. Prison would be too good. Secretary, the radio! Today, 18th June, France asks for an Armistice- The treaty will be signed in the Compi?gne Forest, in a railway carriage where Marechal Foche signed the treaty of 11 th November 1918- - Good evening. - Come in, sir. We were passing and we thought we'd pop in. - Oh, Piscitello! - Good evening. - How's it going? - Good evening. The usual rhubarb cordial for you, and a chinaroot for the lawyer? Thank you. I was just saying to my father-in-law, "why don't uncle's friends come round"? Oh, you know, we didn't want to... we didn't want to "disturb" you. Unfortunately we live in calamitous times. You can come whenever you want. Uncle will be happy to know you still meet. Have you had another letter from your uncle? Yes, the other day. He's in Lipari. He's says he's not bad. - Any news from your husband? - We got a letter today... Thanks. He couldn't make it to the French front. He hopes to come home soon. The war is almost over, right? - Don't you think so, sir? - I... I've no idea. And you, sir? I've no idea, madam. And you? - Madam Maria Piscitello? - That's me. - I need to speak to you. - Come in. - What's going on? - Calm down, don't worry. - Giovanni is in Naples! - Is he coming home? He's setting sail for North Africa. - He's been through it all, my son! - Calm down. I'm going to Naples. I need to get there before midday, otherwise I won't see him. He's setting sail tomorrow evening. I'll come with you. - Stop! - When is the boat leaving? The boat was hit in Villa. "He", capital letter, "combines the military skill "of Alexander, Caesar and Napoleon. " Our troops have withdrawn to new positions on the Greek front- On the 5th and 6 th February, there was a bitter battle in South Benghazi, during which both we and the enemy suffered serious losses- On the evening of the 6 th, the enemy occupied Benghazi- - Have you heard the news? - Just now, Maria. What's going on down there? They all say that Benghazi has fallen. Yes, they just said the same thing on the radio, unfortunately. - They said there were awful battles. - Don't worry, dear. It's not like 1915, when they fought with bayonets. Now it's all done with tanks. When an army sees that the enemy has more tanks, it retreats. And thanks to a great man, we all know who he is, one who combines the military genius of Caesar, Alexander and Napoleon, we have no tanks, cannons or guns, Benghazi will be cleared without much trouble. That's enough! You don't understand a thing. We'll return to Benghazi and we'll also enter Alexandria. The Duce would have done better than Alexander, Napoleon and Hitler, if he had better soldiers. - I'm going! - Maria, listen... Do you realise you're an idiot and that you talk like one? Why are you calling me an idiot? Remember your brother is risking his life? You've offended all of us. Not your mother. She's such an idiot! Ah, listen to the family genius! We're all idiots except him. - Mussolini thought he'd enter the war - Sorry, Maria. Two minutes before it ended, but he entered it two minutes after it began- Italians know this, because they're a bit more mature than their children, who primary school teachers, trained by that school of stupidity and ignorance known as the G-I-L-, tell that Mussolini has the skill of Alexander, of Caesar and of Napoleon- Who's this man? Who is this angel? How does he know all this? Soon even Sicily will be invaded by the Germans- The Sicilians will have the pleasure of hosting lanky blonde Luftwaffe men, and they will meet the children of those defeated in the 1915 war will mix- It's a wonderful race! But look how ugly we are. Try! You'll lick your lips! - We didn't make much of a show. - It wasn't our fault. - We had wooden canons. - We always said it would happen. - We're the ones stuck in the middle. - Exactly! - Giovanni? - He's in the bath! I'm his father! - Son! - Dad! - How are you? - Fine, fine thanks. Have you been discharged? I hope the war ends before the end of my leave. - We'll see. - Your robe. - Let's go. - Goodbye. Thank you. - I'm so hot. I want a swim. - Better not. - But the doctor said I can. - Listen to me, not the doctor. The first months are the most dangerous. You can swim next year. In fact, we'll go to the mountains. The sea's not good for little kids. Did you make a lot of conquests in Rome? I can't complain. And you? I can't complain. - We were so silly. - We had the small-town complex. - What's going on? - War's broken out with Russia. Great! Giovanni, war's broken out with Russia! - What's going to happen now? - What'll happen? Russia's so far away. Where are you going? Let me go! I've got to get to the hospital! My son's in Russia. Let me go! - Doctor, how's my daughter-in-law? - Come with me. I saw her a while ago. The contractions have started. Everything's going fine. The world is wonderful tonight. It's a great time to be born. They turn the lights off even in hospital? You don't seem happy to be living in this era. Sit there, don't worry, I'll go and have a look. Yes, please. - Are they ill? - They've been injured. Everything's going fine. But why didn't your wife come? Know where my wife and daughter are? At the Fascist Women's rally in Rome. Reverend, is it a sin to hope that someone dies? - Of course! - Even if it's for a good cause? Well... - Piscitello? - Yes! Come see your niece. Let them talk badly about Fascism in the hospitals, let them listen to Radio London. They'll hear some good news! The Russian army is destroyed. The British army has no fleet. - Singapore has fallen. - But sir, there's too much freedom... Don't worry. After our victory, they'll be crushed like worms, but now we must concentrate on winning! It's useless thinking otherwise. Democracies have lost the war. - I don't agree. - But Sevastopol has fallen. - And Stalingrad hasn't. - Stalingrad will fall too. Yes, but what about the industrial might of the United States? The ocean between Europe and the US is full of submarines. Then there's North Africa. Alexandria will fall in a matter of hours. Know something? The Duce wants to enter the city on his white horse! - Alexandria won't fall. - Want to know something else? He's told all the bell ringers to be ready, because the day Alexandria falls the bells will ring out all over Italy. Radio News- Bulletin 869 from Military Headquarters. The Headquarters announces that attempts by the enemy to impede manoeuvres in the Sirtica region have failed after fierce battles, in which we destroyed many vehicles. - Do you know him? - No. Never seen him before. And him? I don't understand who he's winking at. - At the one with the glasses. - Who is he? - I think it's Salvatore Privitera. - Yes, it's him. - Write it down. - Turi Reitano brother-in-law. Write that down too. You like it when things go badly, eh? Go on, laugh. Let's see if you laugh tomorrow when we pack you off to Lipari. What about Piscitello? Ah, I don't know. He's not really laughing. I know Piscitello very well, sir. When he laughs, it's always like that. You'd better keep an eye on him. - Piscitello! - What is it? - The Podest? wants you. - Me? Yes, you. Right away. The Germans know their stuff. Wait and see what they do in the Spring. They've retreated to cut the lines of communication - and reinforce the front. - Of course. Traitor! You were seen in front of the Bristol Hotel. - Smiling! - Shame on you! - You should be clubbed! - Defeatist! - I'll throw you out of the Town Hall - But what... You're suspended for a month with no pay. Get out. Out! There! That'll teach you to be a defeatist. If they could hear you cursing when the British planes don't come. They should put you up against a wall. It'd be a good thing. With that misery they pay you, a month won't make much difference. I sold Giovanni's mattress. I got 12,000 lire. The Podest? wants to speak to you. Jesus, what does he want now? 400 lire a month's pension! I could eat chicken every day! All they give me is pasta and chickpeas, Reverend! - Baron, what an honour. - Madam, I need to talk to Piscitello. - Office business? - Yes. Please, excuse us. - Is your father staying here? - He's deaf even to the canons. Piscitello, you're so stupid. Be careful for goodness sake! You got caught like a child! But defeat can't be far off. - Whose? - Ours, of course! Do you think the world will be beaten by a population in big boots, and a barefoot army? Ah, Piscitello! If you knew how much I hate the Town Hall, the Ministry, Fascism, everything! If you knew how much I hate this uniform. "Why don't you resign", you ask? We're part of this deception. We have to see it through until the end. We're servants who hate their masters. We hate and we serve and that's it! Don't say a word, Piscitello? - Not a word to anyone. - No, on my honour. But listen, if you get the chance, I wouldn't mind if you told your friends at the chemist's what I think. I wouldn't mind at all, understand? The voice of London- God Almighty! What are you doing? Calm down, madam! He turned the knob by mistake. Could happen to anyone. In two minutes, we will broadcast a message... - We should listen to the enemy, so that we can despise him even more. Right! This morning US and British troops landed in French North Africa- Oh, dear God! Don't worry, madam. It's all nonsense. - Come on, Piscitello. - I'll see you out. You're a disgrace to the family! We'll be free in a few days. I'll pay your wages out of my own pocket. Let me do it! Today is a great day. Piscitello, don't forget to tell your friends what I think. They've reduced us to wishing the victory of our enemy. I loved Italy more than myself. Now I wish we lose the war. I wore the uniform, I was worse than a monkey. But my son and yours mustn't be monkeys. They must be free men. THE DUCE'S LAST SPEECH. " ALL CITIZENS MUST LEAVE THE CITY BEFORE MIDDAY, "THOSE WITH NO SPECIAL OBLIGATIONS MUST GO TO THE COUNTRYSIDE "OR NEARBY VILLAGES. THE AUTHORITIES WILL PROVIDE TRANSPORT FOR EVACUEES." - Nen?, Pep?! - Oh! How are you both? Dad, look at the state of you! What are you doing? Crying? - Nen?, he's crying real tears! - Hello, dad. But what are you doing here? - Don't worry. - Oh, dear God! The Party's sent us to Sicily to celebrate the founding of Fascism. Ministers have come too and we have to speak... What's there to speak about? Does it look like the right time, this? Maria, is your husband still at the front? - Yes. - Goodbye! Come on granddad, hurry. They didn't even look at you. Rosina! You've come at last! Were you waiting for the house to fall down around you? It's all destiny! Don't start with your moralising, you're all deaf and stupid with it! Look at your dad! Lucky your grandson takes after your wife, me and his mum! - Who's that? - It's my nephew's son. Turi! Do you remember Lauria from Trapani? This is my son-in-law, Aldo Piscitello. Ah, his father's in America. What a big lad! Oh, we're growing old. - Excuse me. - Sure. What are you doing in Pedara? I've been evacuated with my family. But a clerk should never leave his desk without my permission. - Well, I... - I'll give it to you. Listen, I don't understand why your friends treat me so coldly? - Did you tell them what my views are? - I haven't had the time, but... Wonderful! Turi! Let's have a laugh too? Only if it is fine for this gentleman who never says hello. Podest?, I didn't think you were saying hello to me. I'm the least important citizen of Modica, but you're the most. Oh, come on, sir. I'm here to pay tribute to you. - Oh, well. - Your hand, though... - Turi, tell the Podest? your story! - I wouldn't want to offend him. We're all friends here. Come here, party secretary. When the Americans land in Africa, Mussolini and the King are taking a walk. The King sings "Lili Marlene" and laughs. Mussolini says: "Your Majesty, why do you sing and laugh?" The king says: "Don't you know the words?" "No," says Mussolini. "Then listen. " At times I wonder what'll happen to me, then I think of you, and I'm filled with glee! - What's going on? - Planes! - Mr Piscitello! Get in. - Thank you. You're very kind. These soldiers were kind enough to give me a lift. - Why do you go to Modica every day? - I have to sign in at the Town Hall. Thank you. Goodbye! - Mr Piscitello. I'll see you at 8? - 8 sharp. Did you hear Radio London? There's no electricity in the village. I've got no radio. I've got no home. Bombed? The situation of the Italian and German armies in Tunisia is impossible- The Germans are trying to retreat via sea, abandoning their Italian allies- This is the end of Radio London's 6 th broadcast in Italian- Gentlemen, there's no point in pretending. Things are looking bad. If one's been a gentleman, I shouldn't think there's anything to worry about. What do you mean by " nothing to worry about" and "gentleman"? If he hasn't been arrogant, abused his power or... I know how it'll turn out! They'll say I've been arrogant, that I've abused my power, that I've stolen public money or who knows what. But you have done these things! Even if I hadn't, they'd still pretend I had, only because I'm the party secretary and you're the Podest?. Hang on a minute. I simply hold an administrative position, not a political office, like yours. Don't kid yourself. Honest or dishonest, good or bad, we're all part of the same system, and you more than others. Want to know something, my dear party secretary? I'll be so happy to see you go to the devil that I'd go too. I'll remember what you've said if things go well. But luckily they're going badly... You'll come back to Catania with me, Caputo. I'm sorry. Sir, but I've got nothing to do in Catania. We'll be seeing each other again! Baron, look. DANGEROUS FASCISTS The British will ask me for information. I'm the only one who can do the job properly. - So remember me Caputo, ok? - Have no fear, Podest?. Don't worry. I've always known you're against Fascism. Who is it? Who is it? - It's us! - Open up, dad. Who is it? Where are you going? Nen?! Pep?! But... - Hello dad. - At this time of night! Look at you! Where have you come from? We're so tired! - Who are these two? - Get to bed, you! What happened? The party supervisor dumped us in Messina! We had to walk all the way here. - Do you want to eat? - We just want to sleep. Rest now. Listen to me. I'm Laur?a's son, from Trapani, but I was born in America. I'm American. - American? - I landed in Sicily in a submarine. I'm doing this because I'm fighting for freedom. I'll do my duty. You do yours. ANY PERSONS HOUSING PARACHUTISTS OR ENEMY PRISONERS WILL BE SHOT 10,000 LIRE REWARD FOR ANY INFORMATION LEADING TO THEIR CAPTURE - Where's your friend, comrade? - I don't know. He's not here. Get in comrade, ja? I'm going to sell some flour and chickpeas in Modica. We have to make ends meet! - Thank you! - Goodbye. - Is there any post? - No, no post. He hasn't written for three months. Goodbye, Piscitello, and thanks for everything. - Where are you going? - Oh, I'll take care of myself. I won't come back to Pedara. I don't want people to run risks for me. How old are you? 24. This is the key to my house. There's no one there. If you need it. At dawn on 13 th July, 13,000 ships from Africa, Britain and the USA drew near the Sicilian coast- Under the protection of the airforce, the troops prepared to land- After a few days the Allied troops had occupied half the island- - Who is it? - Giovanni. I'm Giovanni Piscitello. The porter told me you're from Pedara. - How are my family? - Fine. I'm Turi Laur?a. - I'm the son of... - Excuse me for interrupting. - Is my son ok? - He is my friend! - We often talk together. - Is he already talking? He's just started. - Where have you come from? - From Russia. How did you get here? As best I could. By train, by truck and on foot. - I'm on leave now. - Eat something. Listen! Fine business. 10 years in Africa, Spain, Albania and Russia. All for this great result. Have a drink. Come on! - So many dead. - For the wrong reason. Many thought it was the right one, unfortunately. - What's the child like? - He's lovely. I've never seen him. What a kid he is. He'll poke a finger in your eye and another in your nose. I'll see him tomorrow. Excuse me, Captain, is this the way to Messina? - Yes, but it's over 100 kilometres. - Bloody hell! - I'm stopping. - Yes, have a rest! - But the Americans will get you. - It's either them or the Germans. - Where are you going? - Home! Home! - Have you seen any British round here? - No! Ok, let's go. You've got your van and we have to walk! - Goodbye lads, and good luck. - Thanks a lot! Where you go? You want leave. Good. War finished, right? They've arrested Mussolini! Badoglio's in government. - It can't be true! - Yes, Badoglio, Badoglio! - What's going on? - Tell us! Is it true? It is! Yes! Ah, at last! What's going on? They've arrested Mussolini. Badoglio is in government now! The war's over. They said so on the radio! The war's over! It's finished! Cowards, we're all cowards! The ones who applauded in the square and the ones who booed at home. We're all scoundrels! We should have gone to prison, as only a few had the courage to do. But we were afraid of prison. Afraid of dying. And instead we killed our sons. Cowards! I killed my son! I killed my son! - He's lost his mind. - He didn't deserve it. And right now! The Americans are here! The Americans! - Piscitello? - What is it? The Podest?, I mean, the mayor wants to see you. Me? Yes, you. Right away. Of course, the list is complete. Oh, well done! Here he is. Sit down, sit down. - Who's this? - Aldo Piscitello. You were a party member from March 1922 and also a squad member. A squad member too? A squad memeber! A squad member. "A squad member is a Fascist "who took part in violence against political adversaries. " Did you hear that? "Against political adversaries. " I will have to dismiss you. It"s the only thing I can do! Because you weren't just a Fascist. You were also a squad member. You know what I mean? I don't want to hurt you, but I've got no choice. What can I do? You were a squad member! - Why doesn't he answer? - He wants to say he wasn't a Fascist, that he wasn't a squad member, that he hated the war, that he was really happy the day the Allies arrived. God knows what else he wants to say! Him too? There's not one who has the courage to say "I was a Fascist". So where are they then? They're all anti-Fascists. All against the war. Everyone wanted the Allies to win. Everyone helped our parachutists! Down there, there's a place that makes great spaghetti. Then if you turn right, you'll see the cathedral. - 2,000! - No. - 2,000. - It's a Fascist squad uniform. And look at all those medals! I bought this for 2,000 lire. Did I pay dearly? It cost me a lot more.
