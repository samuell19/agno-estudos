Steve There's something I have to tell you. I'm a virgin. It's okay. I love you. Let me show you. Oh Steve. Ow. What's up, are you alright? No. Wait. If you'd just fucking relax it wouldn't be so bad. I'm trying okay. - You cum yet? - No. Are you going to? Steve this is really uncomfortable. What you want me to stop? Yes stop, just stop okay, just get get off me now. You work here? Is it always this totally rad? I mean I can't believe your boss lets you throw parties here like when it's closed and everything. Dude, that's so rad. How's it going, you're back. Yeah I'm back. Here, how was your tour? Oh man, it was three weeks of insanity. Now I'm just glad to be back in the Midwest. How was your date with Steve? I really don't want to talk about it. That bad, yeah and it only gets worse from here right? Hey this is a, this is, this is... George. Yeah this is George. Hey George. I saw them in San Francisco and decided it was my duty to become Ericka's love slave. Yeah, we haven't been able to get rid of him ever since. Where's my beer, where'd my beer go? I'll get it. Thank God he's supposed to ride back with Babes in Toyland soon. Yeah you know, I'll see you guys. Okay bye. Bye. Hi Jane. Hey Ryan. So are you and Steve boyfriend and girlfriend now? Hardly. What's wrong, you like some popcorn? No. Have you seen Dave around? He's around somewhere. Are you okay? Yeah, don't worry about it. Hey I found a cool smiley face thing for your collection. Oh wow, thanks. Tom, I can't do this anymore. Why are you getting back together with Paul? Jane, have you met Tom? Dave just hired him a couple days ago. This is Jane our innocent high schooler. Yeah I've seen him around. Yeah I got the job here through Matt. So how'd it go with Steve? Steve Preston? I know him. Have you guys seen Dave around? Yeah he's in there. So that's Jane, urban bitch from hell? Oh you've been talking to Matt? Hey Jane. No, now please just go away. So, how was your date? What the fuck is wrong with you people? I mean don't you have anything better to do with your time than think about whether I'm going on a date or not? I mean I know that it just made your night that everybody's best friend and I went out. But it's not a big deal so leave me the fuck alone. Listen, everybody at the theater gets gossiped about. You're the funnest person to gossip about because you're such a fuckup. Even Dave had a bet on when you were finally gonna go out on a date. I have gone out on plenty of dates. Yeah, like when? I don't know why I have to sit here and listen to some high school dropout who has a negative double digit IQ who can't even hold a job who lives at the theater. Can't even hold it up as far as I recall. Yeah. Dave. Oh hon, it's okay. Don't even worry about that guy. I even made a bet. I won 50 bucks off your ass when that stupid girl broke up with you because you're an alcoholic. You guys had bets on that? I'll tell you about that later dude. He knew I was a virgin. Dave he had a blanket and huge fucking pliers stashed in the backseat of his motorcycle. I mean I should have known right there. Yeah. It just seems like no matter what I do I can't get it right. Anyway I can't believe he used that line. Let me show you how special sex can be. I think I've used that line myself. Oh great that makes me feel so much better. On guys or girls? Guys. But my first time. Remember when we saw the Lost Boys the other night? Yeah. He looked just like Jason Patric. Except he was really popular. He went out with all the girls and stuff. But I always thought he was flirting with me. I was so confused. One day he had football practice, I had detention. We ended up spending the whole night together. I watched him get drunk in the laundry room of our apartment building. The whole time I'm thinking is he coming on to me? I didn't think it could be. And then he grabbed me, and he kissed me. And I knew it was gonna happen. I mean you remember the butter scene in Last Tango in Paris? I'm thinking I don't know if I'm ready for this. I can't handle it. But the freaky thing is though, he wanted me to fuck him. Wow. So was that losing your virginity? Well it was my first time. I thought about it every day for three weeks. And he wouldn't ever talk to me. How did you get over it? I saw Sal Mineo in Rebel Without a Cause. I just got the feeling that I couldn't be the only person that's ever gone through this. After that I wanted to see every movie ever made, still do. That's what I used to think about you. You used to come in here to see everything we ever showed. Yeah. I was so intimidated by all of you when I first came here. But I just knew that I would end up working here somehow. In school everybody just threw things at me in the hall when I walked by. I thought I would escape that working here but it just seems like here I'm a freak because I'm too normal. Will somebody please get me some fucking ice over here? Can't you see the man's hurt? what happened? Well Grace just broke up with Tom tonight to go back with Paul. But Paul came by, saw Grace and Tom talking. And you know how Tom was seeing Grace that week that they were broken up? Well Paul flips out and beats the shit out of Tom. Grace didn't you break up with Paul? After tonight yes. I went out with Grace. And Paul beat the shit out of me too, Tom. Here man I'll get you a beer. I am never dating. Alright man. Hey Tom. Hey Dave. Hey man, you're not gonna fire me, are you? Okay so put this stuff in here right. And then you wait, and then after a while you turn this thing on here right. And then you wait for the thing to steam. And then once it steams a little bit you like put some salt in there and you like rake it back and forth. But before you do that... You gonna let her train Tom in? He'll be more a fuckup than she is. Shut the fuck up Matt. You shut up, you Jewish troll. Fucking sitting on your ass all day talking on the phone. Go back to the suburbs. Yeah, it didn't seem like you were having such a hard time with the suburbs yesterday when you were trying to fuck that mall girl. But I heard you didn't have such a hard time after all 'cause you were too drunk. You are gonna die. I'll kill you. Just make sure they clean it up. Matt get off me, fucking get of me. Do you want to keep it down a bit? We're trying to watch the movie. Fuck you. Stop it, stop it. Fuck you. Stop, stop it. Hold on a second man. Go clean up this mess. You clean it up. Hey Steve. Hey what's up man? How you doing man, good to see you again. Yeah you know I heard about you guys. I guess that didn't go so well huh? Yeah it was kind of lame. You know we were over in the cemetery and you know I'm totally ready to go. And then she tells me she's a fucking virgin. So I calmed her down, just like it's cool, it's cool. And then just when she's about to cum she starts screaming and crying, just totally freaking out. Right Steve, I'm sure you were just about to make her cum. What's up dude? What are you jealous got tagged her before you? Get your pathetic ass out of my fucking face. Whatever dude. Hey, what's up Tom? Hey man. I hate everyone. You would never treat a girl that way would you? Actually my first time was kind of reverse. I was really in love with this girl. We were at this party. She was way too drunk. Were you? No, no I've always been straight edge. Even cigarettes? No, just the occasional cigar. We were running around, we ended up in this parking garage between this Cadillac Seville on this VW Bug. It was over before I even knew what happened. I looked down and somehow my watch is busted. Jane I'm really sorry about what happened. Me and Steve aren't even really friends, just knew each other through skating. Really? That's so weird. I wish he was more like you. Hey Jane can I talk to you? I have to go in. Okay Ryan. Thanks for the bendy doll. Yeah. It's really cool. I'm sorry it's not really from the 70's. So. What do you want? I feel bad about what happened the other night. I want to try to make it up to you or something. How, going on another date but not fucking? Yeah I mean, if we fucked it would be better than last time that's for sure. I think just about anything would be better than last time. Steve, why do you like me? I mean what do you think of me? I mean really like why do you want to go out with me? I don't want anything serious or anything. I just, you know. I wasn't asking you to walk off into the sunset with me or anything. Nobody's gonna eat that much popcorn in a week. God this is your fault, you stupid suburban fuck. Hey Matt, you could ease up on her you know. What's your problem? She's a spoiled suburban loser. She comes in here taking jobs away from city kids so she can go back to the suburbs and tell her friends how cool she is by working in the city. And she has nothing to do with you blowing Steve off? Fuck you. Start eating some of this popcorn goddamnit. Hey this isn't diet soda. Is that real butter or is it some fake liquid stuff? All I got's pennies. I counted them all up, I'm sure it's $6. You know this is really important 'cause I don't eat sugar. I'm from the Traditional Values Committee. Can we have our money back, just fuck this. What are those? I don't know, relax Jane. I was just asking. It's Valium, want some? So what's the story with Jane? She's kind of weird. Well I guess you're the expert on weird huh? I mean she's cool, she's smart and all but she's not a real girl, she's not like, she's not like Grace you know. I would not call Grace real. What do you think of Ryan? He's a cutie. Would you go out with him? No, it'd be kind of like dating my little brother. What about Tom? What about Tom? Well would you go out with him again? I don't know, I kind of doubt it. Why? Because he's so nice. I think it would be better if we just stayed friends. Yeah I know what you mean. I just don't wanna have anything to do with the whole thing anymore, I hate sex. Yeah I felt that way for a long time. When I was 15 a shithead got me really drunk and I ended up passing out. And when I woke up he was humping me, fucking me. He raped me. So I ended up losing my virginity a month later with my friend Scott. It kind of sucked we were really wasted. How could you lose your virginity? It doesn't count. It only counts if you say yes. It gets better. Goodnight. - Goodnight. - Yeah goodnight man. See you later. Bye. You want me to walk you to your car? Why? I don't know, don't you get nervous walking around at night? Here, no. You're a tough girl, huh? I'm not tough. Hey, can I ask you something? Depends on what it is. Well, what did Steve do that was so terrible? He was dishonest with me. What and that's a crime? Yes, he doesn't have the balls to be straight about what he wants I mean. I mean if he told me he just wanted to have sex with me I might have been okay with that. I mean I was curious, I was curious what all the hype was all about, what sex was like. I wouldn't have wanted more if you hadn't pretended that's what he wanted. Yeah but Jane you know that would have been honest. Oh why, what's so secret about the male ego that you can't show any emotion about anything? Did all those beer commercials really fuck you up that much? What? Nothing. What was your first time like? What are you talking about? Come on. I don't know, I was about 15 you know and I was with this slightly older catholic school bad girl you know. Fantasy time. Well things get underway and taking their course. The moment of consummation arrives you know. And I've already spent my load as the saying goes. I felt like a real dolt you know. I can't believe I just told you that. My car's over there. I'm glad you told me. It's nice to know it's not easy for guys either. Want a ride lover boy? No, I think I'll walk home and take a cold shower. Well see ya. Alright. Hey you want some popcorn? Grace, look up at me. How does it feel to be the citizen of a country that has total equal rights for women? Will you get that fucking thing out of my face? Hey Jane, put the camera on me. You know, it sucks being in a country where women have equal rights. Because they're all bigger than us. And they strap us down all the time. And the beat us and they whip us when we don't behave. And those straps, they can really hurt. Fuck you, Matt. What? Come on, come on. Alright, alright I'll film you. Are you on? Yeah. I, Jane am total ruler of this fabulous country, Zamboni. We are a country that respects and values women and their thoughts and input. We have equal wages for men and women except when women do a better job, which is often. We love our children and we respect them, and when they tell us things we... Jane we respect you too. Here, this is our Chief of Staff. Ryan, king of the geeks. Go. I am the Cardinal from Zamboni. We treat all the environment with total respect. Styrofoam is out, as are all CFCs. We love our friends the animals and we treat them with total respect. There's no judging in Zamboni. Cool. Hey Matt, are we going drinking tonight? Hey Tom you want to be interviewed for my class project? Did you see the body on that girl who came in during the last rush? She wanted me too. Hey were you saying something? Yeah I was saying something. That total fox that came in during the last rush. You know you were hitting on her as hard as I was. Oh yeah man, and she slipped me a phone number right past her date and everything. Fuck you. It's true man, 100%, check this out. Holy shit man. You gonna call her? Oh fuck no. What? Give it to me then man. What the hell's the matter with you? I hate that movie. A light hearted tale of a spunky young girl my ass. People don't act that way. She gets date raped, they call that light hearted? Who makes this shit? Men. Hey Dave? Yeah. What do you think of Ryan? Could a guy be more adorable? I know. I used to think he was kind of a nerd but well do you think you could maybe schedule us together more? Mary Jane, I thought you didn't wanna have anything to do with men. Okay. Really? Sure. Yes. Hey, I want to ask you something alright. I want a straight up answer, not the usual bullshit okay. What do you think about Jane? Oh my God. You're worse than a faggot man. You've lost your fucking mind. That's what you really think? I fucking can't stand the bitch, she's a dough ball. You don't like her at all, not one bit? Not at all, not one bit. Oh my God I don't believe we're fucking talking about this. Hey man, I just thought of something. Mud Honey's playing at Nye's tonight and if we hurry our asses off this fucking stage and get out that door we can catch the last set. Fuck yeah man let's go. Well don't forget this. I don't want to go. Why do you always do this shit? I'm not, I just don't like the fact that we leave Jane alone so often, I'm sick of traveling. Do we have to go on every business trip that comes up? Now that we're finally making enough money that we can enjoy ourselves you have to go off. You always have to complain about something. I want to save enough money so we can send Jane to college. So she can have all the opportunities that I never had. Oh yeah, now you want money for Jane to go to college. Can we also talk about not being a bastard? She's ready to throw away everything for one of the best schools in the country. And you know why? That fucked up job with her hanging around with those weirdos and drug addicts. It was your idea to let her take that job in the first place. Me, me? You're the one who promised if she made the honor roll she could do whatever she wanted. Oh yeah and what does she want? To make something of her herself, or to end up like those fucking losers? The thing that I don't understand is why she doesn't go away just to get the hell away from you. We're all going to camp, it's going to be totally nice. Yeah we're staying at a hotel room... Okay class, Jane's gonna present the project for group one. So here it is. Jane I'm sorry I couldn't come over and help but I had a meeting for the prom planning committee. Yeah, I had hockey practice. So like, what'd you do? I interviewed people at my work. Okay, Zamboni to me is a country where the government supports the artists and stuff. Like if you want to be in a band you can totally do it. And they'd be like... Man what is that? And it pays really well. Is that, what is that in her nose? And all the beer you can drink is free all the time. Wait can I say that or are you gonna get in trouble? Oh they're just a bunch of losers anyway don't worry about it. I don't think you can say that. Well I'm just gonna edit this stuff out. Let's talk about losers Jane. Hey Grace come here. Tell them what you like about living in Zamboni. I asked here she won't do it. So Grace, tell us about what you like about living in Zamboni. This is so weird. Zamboni, the country where Jane is President and there's equal rights and stuff. Oh, okay yeah it's cool. You can write sappy poetry and nobody gives you shit for it. And boys see women as people and... Loser. If you don't like them in a romantic way they don't get upset. Right there are no asshole boyfriends in Zamboni. Yeah because all the assholes are expelled from the country and boys who cheat on their girlfriends with strippers are fed to the lions. And castrated. Jane. Skinheads, skinheads are made slaves to all us women. Whatever. They have to carry all the band equipment on all the tours every place. Yeah and they have to bring us chocolate. Where do you work? I didn't have a chance to edit it. Jane I think we've seen enough, turn it off. Yes Mr. Bullock. Tickets will be $6 please. - $6, you gotta be kidding! - $6 for one lousy film? You gotta be kidding? How much is your goddamn popcorn? Jane will you get Tom and Matt from the basement please? Sure Ryan. No no no forget it. We're not pay $6 for his lousy film. Excuse me but I wanted extra butter on this popcorn. There really isn't that much butter on it at all. Okay let me take care of it for you. No what I want to know first is why this happens every time I come in here. I mean are you people all retarded or what? Fuck you asshole. It's like school. They want you to learn all this fucking shit that you're not gonna use. It's a lot of crap. Yeah I'm not gonna need all that math dude. What are you gonna need it for? You just need to know how to add, subtract, divide, and multiply. Hey guys can you get back upstairs? It's only like the busiest movie with that 3D porn thing. Listen don't worry about it Jane. You can come down after the next shift. We still got half a bottle left. Forget it, I have homework to do. Oh Christ Jane, all you do is homework. I have finals. I have finals. We'll be back in about half an hour. Jane don't you ever go out? Tom, I told you. Yeah but school's almost over. You've been accepted to college. You've been on the honor roll since birth. You ought to relax a little bit. Hey you got off at 9:30 right? Yeah. Yeah well so do I, and at 9:30 I'm gonna do a quick change and I'm gonna go to this party over on Lincoln and Third. You wanna go with me? Ah no. Oh it'll be fun, we'll get loaded. You're already loaded. Yeah you know but by the time the party starts I'll have sobered up. Can I get something? Excuse me, the movie's already starting. There's a man sitting next to me jerking off in the theater. There's something wrong in the left channel of the stereo. The bass is just really terrible, it just keeps cutting out. I just paid $6, actually $12 for my girlfriend and I to come in here and see this movie. We're getting pelted in the back the head. You realize the American family is in a great deal of trouble and we're trying to help in this community. So why you drag your minimum wage butt back there and babysit these kids so I don't have to deal with them alright. Hey, mind if I join you up here? Oh no, not at all. I am so tired, fuck that last rush was a bitch. God and the way that lady was complaining about the cost of her ticket, it's like why she even fucking come to the movies, you know? And did you see Ryan? I thought he was gonna burst a blood vessel, it's like. And Ryan never gets mad about anything. I know, he's so excellent. He's almost like Jesus you know I mean he's so pure and he doesn't drink, he doesn't smoke. He doesn't fuck. Yeah why is that? Well I heard he had some girlfriend once from New York, or she moved to New York and then you wrote her all these love letters and she didn't write him back like not even once. I think he was really bummed. I bet that's the girl he lost his virginity to. What, I thought he was a virgin? How do you know he's not? Well you know since this Steve thing everybody's told me their first time. They have? Well you know. Found out anything good? No, but you know how in that movie Reckless with Daryl Hannah and Aidan Quinn they have sex for the first time in that boiler room and it's really beautifully lit and fun, and exciting, and dangerous, and weird? It's like when you actually do it you're just in a boiler room. It's really dirty, and wet... And stinky, and sweaty. Yeah. And Aidan Quinn turns out to be kind of an asshole. Yeah but you know I've never met a girl who like had fun the first time she had sex. Really? Well yeah I mean how can it be fun? It's like you're totally hurting. You're like gritting your teeth just thinking God you know when is this gonna be over. I mean guys don't have to think about pain, they're just thinking about cumming. I mean a girl's not gonna lay there in pain and think oh God am I gonna have an orgasm? That's like that comes later after the pain goes away. Well how long does that take? Oh later on you know when you learn to flip the guy over so you can get on top. You get more clit stimulation that way you know. And especially if you grind really hard. Now that's when it gets really fun. More what stimulation? Clit, the clitoris. You know what the clitoris is right? Well yeah I mean, I mean in sex ed they told us it was above the labia majoria, whatever. I mean yeah I know what it is, and I know what it is. Well the clit's like a little button at the top of where your vagina lips meet, and it's really ultra sensitive. A button? Well kind of, some are innies and some are outies. What you should do really you should go home and get a mirror and check yours out. Find it, touch it, play with it. You know if you masturbate you find out what you like. And then when you're with a guy it's so much easier for you to cum. You masturbate? Fuck yeah. Really, like I'm not a loser if I masturbate? God Jane, you're a loser if you don't, I mean... Really? You're missing out on the big stress reliever. God I remember the first time I jacked off. It was like in the morning and then I walked around all day. And I felt like everyone knew I had masturbated. You know it's even the best when you know someone really well and you can tell them what you like, they can tell you what they like. 'Cause you know everybody's different and that way it's a better experience for both of you. What was the first time you had sex like? Oh God it was awful. We were in his basement, in his rec room. And I remember his cat was watching. Like it totally fucking hurt and he didn't seem to notice that it hurt me. It was pretty obvious all he wanted to do was get off, the whole two minutes that it took him to get off. I don't know, I really liked him though. When we got done you know we're just laying there and he just kind of looked into my eyes and got all kind of weird and romantic and he said... Olive juice. What's that supposed to be? I love you, you know it looks like you're saying I love you. That's so weird. It was so tacky. I mean I had been devirginized by this guy you know. I felt like I gave something of myself to him. And then he did that and what a dick. Fucking wanted to kill him. Yeah my first time was pretty awful. But it does get better, it really does. Maybe I'll just masturbate for the rest of my life. Hey your hand is your best friend. Always with you, you don't have to worry about wearing a rubber, and you don't have to wake up next to somebody and wonder who the fuck they are and have nothing to say to them. You know Molly I thought you were positively swell the way you handled my friends tonight. What do you mean by that? No please, don't get me wrong. What are you saying? But Molly, Molly. Molly I don't care what anybody else thinks. I want you to be my girl. I love you Molly. This isn't gonna be one of those throw up punk rock parties is it Tom? No. Hey Jane, how you been? Hey, how's it going? Alright. Hey Jane. Allison. You have to come with me now. Okay, like I'll see you later. Alright. Hey Tom. Hey Allison, what's going on? Nothing, come on Jane. You came here with Tom O'Keefe? Yeah why? He is so rad. He's like almost a man you know. He hangs out with that ultra cool crowd. I don't know, I think you have the hottest date here Jane. Well it's not a date. You know my friend Rhonda was just telling me about the time her sister was in the hospital. She had that like like puffy thing that kind of split open and all this puss was everywhere. Yeah, and Tom was her friend and totally visited her all the time in the hospital. The night before she got out of the hospital he went to all the neighbors yards, took all the most beautiful flowers out and planted them outside her window before she got home. Is that not so sweet? Hey, is my sister up there? On no she starts early tomorrow. Hey Ericka. Fuck off Tom, I mean I can't believe you're even talking to me right now. I mean what's it been a week now you've been avoiding me? Do you want to go outside and talk about it? Oh do you think you can handle it? I mean you might get fucking cooties or something. Ericka you know listen. This whole thing's really knocked me for a loop you know. It's gonna take me some time to figure it all out. You know. I gotta go, I gotta find someone. Alright. Look Tom, can we just keep this between us? Yeah of course, of course. Ericka. Jane I'm lost. Ericka I love you man. I love you too. Hey I gotta go okay. There you are. Oh hey there little miss social butterfly. Hi. Hi. Ow. Hi. Hi. Hi. Howdy. Howdy. Hey. Hey. You wanna go? I guess I should take you home. Sorry man, I didn't know that was your mom's car. Are you okay, can you drive? No, yeah I'm fine. Oh then I guess you should take me home. Oh hey, what about your station wagon? Oh, I'll pick it up tomorrow. Your parents won't get mad? No, they're away. Hey nice house. Thanks. Tom I had a really nice time. I'm glad you made me go out. I had a really nice time too. Hey Jane. What? Nothing. Hey, are you working tomorrow? No thank God but I have school in three hours. I'll see you later. Okay, I'll see you. Hey so when are you gonna get up the nerve to buy a vibrator? Oh I don't know. You say that now. God you know I wonder what it would be like with Ryan. Or Tom. Can you imagine what would it be like with Matt? You don't want to know. What? You didn't. Did you and Matt like? He was my first. No way. Yeah. He was mister olive juice? God you know my band even had a song about it, The Lame Fuck. ♪ Those were the worst two minutes of my life ♪ Lame fuck. - Hey Dave. - Hey Dave. Hey guys. Don't you think you should be getting ready for the next show? We were just doing that. I'm sure you were. How many times have I told you not to sit on the counter? Where's Tom and Matt? Matt is running an errand and Tom would be downstairs getting high? I'll be downstairs. Hey I'm gonna go get some smokes okay. I'll be right back. Okay. Don't smile so much or everybody might know what you been up to. Shit. Yes. Fuck. Hey. Throw it to me. Oh what? - Try it again. - Idiot. Just throw it. Fuckhead. Just throw the damned popcorn. Moron. Sorry, asshole. Oh good. This could be like a whole new thing for you. Fucking idiot, idiot. Throw it. Ryan, wait up. Hey, I thought you like had the day off. I do I just come to see the film. Oh cool. Hey Matt. Yeah you're early. Yeah I know, but the film's about to let out anyway. Yeah, oh wait I have something for you. Here look. Wow, that's cool. I think it's actually from the 70's. - Thanks. - Yeah. - See ya. - Bye. What a dork. He's not. What do girls see in him? Every girl I know has a crush on him and he is such a wuss. I don't have a crush on him. Ryan. Hey Jane. What's up? The movie ended. What did you come up here for? Nobody comes up here. I don't know I'm feeling kind of restless right now. I just like to come up here and think sometimes. What are you thinking about? I just wish I was more cool and exciting like Matt. Matt? What do you want to be like him for? He's a fucking loser. He's so suave. He knows what he wants to do. He goes out with whoever he wants to. He does whatever he feels like doing. You're talking about a guy whose whole life is about drinking, picking up girls, and getting the shit kicked out of him. I don't know, I'm 22 years old and I just feel like I'm missing out. Then move out of the Midwest. Yeah. So Grace what's up with you and Paul? What do you mean? Well are you guys still together? No. So why don't you go out with Tom again then? Ericka it's over. Why don't we just leave it at that okay. Come on he still likes you I can tell. He's cute, he's funny, he's nice. Why don't you go out with him then? I can't go out with Tom, I've known him forever. I know his whole family. And besides if you're not going out with Paul... Ericka stop. God what's up with you? If I tell you guys something you have to swear and not tell anyone. I swear. Yeah me too. No. Oh come on you can't do that. Grace, what's wrong? I'm pregnant, I don't know what the fuck I'm gonna do. You guys are the first ones I've told. How long have you known? About a month. How far along are you? Five months. - Five months? - Five months? How could you not have known? I don't know. My cycle's always been kind of wacky, you know. What? She's a partier. If you do a lot of drugs sometimes you miss your period. You can't even get an abortion now can you? Thank you for reminding me of that. Are you gonna keep it? I don't know. I'm looking at this adoption agency in Boston. I'll be in Boston. I want to get out of this damn town anyway. You been seeing a doctor I hope, and getting vitamins and everything you need. You stopped drinking? Yes. Oh good. I'm going to quit those things. You've been really cool. God how could you have known for a month and not told anyone? It seems like everybody I know around here is an ex-boyfriend. Ericka I feel like a rhinoceros. Why? These pants are too loose. Oh you cannot even tell. You lie so bad. It's just because you ate all that popcorn earlier. Sure, sure I just want you to look at this. Don't. You can't tell, you cannot. Do you know they know? They do don't they? Hey. Wow you guys look great. Hey Dave, give up on men? I wouldn't mind finding somebody as fine as Jane. We just came from my honors banquet at school. Why didn't your parents take you? Oh my parents, you know they're always away. So Dave took me. Everyone was like, "that's your dad?". Well Jane why don't you come with me downstairs and we'll have a celebratory drink. Okay. So how were the suburbs Dave? Weird. Every morning I pray to Jesus to make our school number one, number one in athletics, and in academic excellence. I am very proud to be this year's valedictorian. Being a christian athlete has helped me focus my faith and understand the trials I am to face not only in this life but in the hereafter. I know that 90% of our honor students, 90% belong to their church groups and... That really makes me feel good. My only regret for the students is that they cannot fully express their faith in the Lord in the school system, that our government keeps good Christians from taking full advantage of every possible resource. So Jane's a geek in school huh? Yeah well I want to be a geek in a school full of Stepford children myself. What's your problem Matt? I mean you dated cheerleaders from her school before. You know she's not like those shallow bimbos. She's a spoiled bitch. Matt, shut the fuck up. What? Oh you're just so deprived aren't you? What have you ever done that's so great? Oh yeah, you're the greatest drunk in town? Remember when you were sober for two years and people actually liked you? I'm pregnant Matt. I used to think about how great it would be having uncle Matt tell my kid about the good old days with his mom and dad. But you know I don't fucking think so because I don't want my kid around such a fucking pathetic excuse for a human being. Grace you're pregnant? Yes, please don't fire me right now. I really need this job. Hell girl I'm not gonna fire you, as long as you can fit behind the counter. Besides, I won 20 bucks off your sorry ass. Pay up Matt. You knew? How'd you know? Honey, I had three sisters. Why didn't you say anything? I figured when it was time you'd let us know. Why do you think he kept getting all the easy shifts? Are you gonna keep the baby? Well Paul and I had a really long talk and I think we're gonna try and make it work. I'm gonna have this baby. Are you doing it for yourself or are you doing it for your parents? For myself. I mean you could be anything right? So why waste four years of your life going to college? Because I want to make something of myself. I don't want to end up... What? What here, like me? That's not what I meant. Yeah I know. Look all I'm trying to say is that intelligence isn't measured by whether or not you graduate a Merit Scholar or not. Look what it did for me. You were a Merit Scholar? Yeah I was a Merit Scholar. How come you never told me that? Well you never asked me that. ♪ Wrote you a sexy post card ♪ Hey Tom, Jane, Grace is pregnant. Pop for you. Pop for you. Beer for you. - Thanks. - I'm gonna be a mom. Hey, who's upstairs? Ryan doesn't drink so he said he'd watch the lobby. I can't believe Dave knew, that fucker I can't believe it. I just feel so much better now that this albatross is off my neck. Good. Hey you want a ride home? Okay. Okay, bye guys. Bye. - See ya. - Bye. Oh God are you gonna drag him all the way home? No we're just gonna go around the corner to my house. You guys need a place to crash? That's okay. Dave, if you try to fuck me on your couch tonight I'm gonna kill you. That's not what you said the last time. You guys lock up okay. Yeah. What now? Yeah like there's anything to do in this town after one. Hey I know. Let's go to Madison. Wisconsin? We'd play music on the streets and then went out drinking all night long with the money we made. I'd love to do something, I'd love to go to New Orleans. Well you know we'll go next year. Yeah right, I'll be in Boston. Oh fuck college Jane, you know. Just hang out with me. We'll go to New Orleans in the spring. And then summertime will roll around, we'll get antsy and drive out to San Francisco. I would love that. Well, come on Jane, don't go. Pull over at this next exit up here. Tom. I am. I don't want to you know, fuck. Okay. Well I'm up for anything you are. Really? Anything? Yeah. Anything I want? Wait, a little to the right. Wait, move down a little lower, right there. Wait, can you go to the left a little? Now up, a little up. Oh right there. Hey Jane. What? Have you ever tried 69? No. Show me. Yeah? Okay. Wait, let's just take turns okay. Okay. Oh God Jane... oh God. Oh God Jane, bite it. What? Yeah bite it like a beef jerky. Are you sure? Yeah, yeah, I kinda like it. Okay. Oh Jane. Good morning. So, I haven't really seen you around in a while. Yeah. How was graduation? Boring. Good to be out though. How have you been? Okay. Hey there's Mary Jane. Dave. How was your graduation? Boring. My English teacher asked about you though. Me? Yeah, he thought you were cute. Where's Matt? I have to rub it in his face that I graduated. Jane, Matt doesn't work here anymore. Oh yeah right, what is he in jail? What? He was stealing? That little shit was making more money than I was. Fucking loser, he didn't even know he was hitting on Ericka's girlfriend last week. What? Jane you didn't know that Ericka was bi? No, I had no idea. Does it freak you out? Well yeah kind of, I mean it's not like she sits around listening to Holly Near all day. God you've seen those skinheads that hangout at the clubs they play at. I mean even in that scene I don't think it's that cool to be a dyke. I wouldn't be that loud about it. How do you know so much about what goes on? I just feel like I'll never get it. Oh God I'm old. I mean when you've been around here as long as I have you see everything. I've hired them all. Oh you're so jaded. So it looks like you have to hire someone new. No, I don't think that's gonna happen. I'm only gonna be here for another month. What? I never caught Matt stealing. You know how this company sends in people anonymously to file reports, check receipts. The whole thing doesn't make me look that good. Shit. No I think it's a good thing. I'm looking into buying and renovating that theater down the street. I'm sick of babysitting shit. Crazy Mary Jane, I'm gonna miss you. I'm gonna miss you too Dave. I thought I smelled alcohol. Ericka. Remember when me and you went out? You were a great fuck. I'm leaving town man, you might never see me again. I wish. Oh come on. Let's go in the janitor's closet like the old days. Matt stop it. What, what? Like you're too cool for me now that you've made it maximum rock and roll. Just 'cause my band has its shit together and yours doesn't isn't my fault. Yeah right. Like all those guys wanting to get in your pants doesn't help record sales. You know I never realized till now how much I don't like you. And look what you pulled last week man, getting busted stealing so you get Dave in trouble. Really cool, really smooth. Right Ericka like you can afford to tour all the time. I wasn't so fucking drunk that I messed up and got caught. Now you've ruined it for everybody else. You're just pissed because I'm not gonna be here anymore for you to lust after. Oh yeah that's it, right. What are you fucking stupid? Do you remember the night I popped your cherry and you were so scared I had to lay there and hold you all night long? You think you are such a fucking stud. But has any girl told you yet how much you really suck in bed? And remember Susie Johnson's party where that girl was giving you head and she threw up? I'll bet you remember that don't you? Get the fuck away from me. You are a fucking pig. Hey is that bottle of scotch still stashed back here someplace? No you drank it with those guys you were playing chess with last night. Oh shit that's right. Tom I need to talk to you. I feel really weird. Well what are you doing on Thursday? Nothing. You want to go to check out a band at Nye's or something and then get a cup of coffee after the show and, do all that? That would be good. Alright well, I gotta go, Matt's waiting for me out in the back and we're gonna go drinking before he leaves tomorrow. What? Yeah well I mean you know him. He's got some girlfriend in Alabama and her dad's gonna set him up with a job or something. He's not gonna come in here and say goodbye? Oh you know you wanted to. He felt really weird about putting Dave in such an awkward position. You chicken shit. Jane. The whole time you've worked here you've been abusive, inconsiderate, stupid, and drunk. And now you're telling me you're gonna go off to Alabama to leech off some unlucky girl and you weren't even gonna apologize for being so mean to me? I mean you are not gonna say goodbye to Dave? Jane you geek. Look, maybe I'll see you in Boston someday. Yeah I hope not. Hey listen do me a favor. Say goodbye to Dave for me okay? Hey, I'll see you later. Dude, have you seen Tom? What? I said have you seen Tom? No but he'll be here soon. He's bringing some chick from his work. What? I said he's bringing some chick from his work. What do I look like, his travel agent? Hey guys what's up? What? What happened? Jane there's been an accident. Tom. He was drunk and he drove the wrong way down a one way street. Dave's at the hospital right now and it sounds really serious. Ericka what do we do? Let's get here into Dave's office. Hey come on. Don't call my parents. I mean can I, can I stay with you? Yeah that's fine. Dave how is he? He's not gonna make it. What? It's Tom. He was in a car accident, he didn't have a chance. He died about an hour ago. He drove the wrong way down... My friend is dead. We only slept together once. That's the the real reason Ericka, he was too nice. I thought I didn't deserve somebody as nice as Tom. I just blew it, fucking blew it. You know he was finally getting over that stupid boy phase where all he'd do is skateboard and drink with the boys. And he was like writing, and playing music again. How'd you know that? Remember when you asked me why I don't go out with Tom? Yeah. Well I been seeing his sister Laurie. No way. Yeah I didn't want anyone to know really because I was afraid. Did he know? He found out. First he like totally freaked out and he avoided me for like a week. And then we talked and he was really cool about it. Fuck. You know I used to live in this town and even though your past is always in your face and there's no chance of like change or becoming anything different. Everybody's always like the same all the time you know. And so I lived here five more... What's it like? I don't know it's kind of like New Orleans you know. You know a really festive environment. How do you make a living? You don't have to, you just. You know that's the great thing about Zambuli. Zamboni, hello. Zamboni. I can't believe you guys fooled around in the backseat of his car. It was great. The first time I ever came with anybody. So what were you guys going to talk about tonight? About us, and where we stood. Now he's gone, there's no one to ask. I feel totally alienated from everyone who knew him. They all knew him all their lives. Who the fuck am I? We fooled around in his car, so what? I remember when I met him. And I thought he was just like Matt. Yeah. I can't believe he's dead. I mean there were so many times when he would crash out here because he was too wasted to find his car. I feel responsible. So are you still going on tour? I don't know, I mean. I thought about not going you know. I told the band and everybody like really freaked out. The whole thing with Laurie is. I don't want to leave right now. She's just spending like every minute with her parents. They don't know about us. I don't know. It might be good just to get away. I'm gonna miss the funeral though. You're not going? Jane I don't know it would be weird. I don't like funerals. I don't know if I can handle this funeral. How you doing? I really can't believe it you know. I keep expecting him to walk through the door any moment. And then with the baby I've been doing a lot of thinking. The other night I was laying on my back and baby kind of shifted to one side so my stomach was flat and there was a big huge bulge out of the side of my hip. And it scared me. Paul just when he got the video camera 'cause he wanted to tape it 'cause he said it looks so cool. I tried to tell him that our lives are gonna change because of this. He just told me to not bother talking because he was gonna dub the video with the sound track from Eraserhead. I can't go. I have to meet with the bank about the new theater. Is Matt going? He can't afford it. I think if he came back here it would be too real. Are you gonna go? So you guys, this is the last time. Can't believe it's over. Dave you need help with that? Sure. I'll give you a call as soon as I can figure out what's going on. It could be a couple of months though before I can hire you. It's alright no, I'll volunteer if I have to. Just give me a call. Okay. Goodbye And just where do you think you're going young lady? I'll be right back. That was bold. Oh what's he gonna do fire me? It's not like you've gotten it together to hire anyone else. Anyway he's a dick, I don't care. Well why'd you bother to stay? Well it's only three more weeks and I figured if Ryan can do it so can I. Oh Mary Jane you are throbbing and ready to go. Shut up. Hey do you think I should tell him? I mean what if he likes? I'm leaving so soon, what if he doesn't? Girl get a grip. What do you want to do? I don't know. Dave. Yeah? Do you think it's okay that I still like Ryan I mean after everything with Tom? I'm just so confused. After Tom I wanted to push all that away but I still have those feelings. I just feel like I'm going crazy. You always like Ryan, even before you and Tom. Just because someone dies doesn't mean that you have to die too. I worked 13 hours straight and you jipped me of my overtime pay. What are you talking about? Look at these time sheets. I can see where you changed the number. You calling me a liar? This is how you thank me? After all I did for you when you first got here you didn't have your shit together. Now look here buddy. This is bullshit, I quit. Okay leave, no problem. Goddamn fucking. Well what do you want? Hi I just want to say I think it's really vile that you passed Grace up for that promotion for that guy that's only been here a week. You think I have time for this? Get back to work. You're an asshole. I quit. You fucking cow. Oh eat me fuckhead. Hey Ryan wait up. Hey. I got the day off.

What are you thinking Jane? Jane? About you. I was thinking about how much I like you. I like you too Jane. We're pals. No Ryan I mean I like you. I've had a big crush on you for a long time now. Jane I'm really flattered but I consider us friends. I don't want to lose that. I just don't have romantic feelings for you. I think it took a lot of guts for you to say what you said. I could never be that honest with anyone. I really respect you for that, I mean it. When you leaving for school? Three days. You must be so excited to get out of here. I don't know. For a while I was considering not going. I mean you know right before Tom died I was sort of starting to feel at home here for the first time, ever probably. But now I don't know. Anyway I don't know where I'm supposed to go. So I'm going to Boston. Jane you'll always have us here. Yeah you're not gonna go forget about us are you? Hey we have to give you your present. What? Oh my God. You guys are the best. Weirdos. Remember when I had a crush on you way back when? I never dreamed you'd realize your mistake, fall madly in love with me, and that we'd be married. Remember how we used to fight like cats and dogs? I'm so glad that we figured out that underneath it all we're really in love with each other. And now we're getting married? Remember how you were in love with me and I blew you off? Thank the Lord they revived you after your near fatal accident and you found me and expressed your undying love and won me over. And now you're marrying me and agreeing to be the father that my child has always needed. What? Yeah after I kicked that Paul guy out, the state demanded that he pay child support 'cause I'm on GA. So he had to take a blood test and they figured out that the blood types didn't match. I just... They only had sex once. That's amazing. Kind of cosmic you know, kind of knowing that Tom's still alive in a way. Do Tom's parents know? Well it took took a while for me to work up the nerve to tell them. But since I have they've been really really cool. Yeah they're gonna babysit next fall when we go on tour so Grace can come with us. You're going on tour? Well Jane I haven't mellowed out that much. I should interview you guys for my Zine, Olive Juice. I should give you a copy of our new album to review. Would you do that? Yeah totally. Yeah you know there's even a live version of Lame Fuck on that, a really old one. You guys were so great when I saw you in Boston. That was a good show. You know we played in Colorado on that same trip and ended up at that Matt lives out there now. No. And his band opened for us. He must have loved that. You know though he wrote me this really cool letter when he found out about Danny. Sent me all these really great pictures of Tom. I've been wanting to give you one. Wow. Thanks Grace. Here he is. Dave. Miss Mary Jane. I see you've met my lover, Curt. He's very cute. Hey have you still got that fake ID? Yeah. Good because we're going out. It's great. It's really good to see you Jane. You haven't changed. What? Hey what's up Ryan? Hey Steve. Hi Steve. Do I know you? I'll see you later Ryan. What a little shit. Oh my God, oh my God that. Jane don't. You read books? No. Yeah me neither. No I read the comics sometimes. Can I help you? No actually I was just coming to say hi to my friend, Allison. Jane. Hi. How are you? You look great. Oh thanks. Oh my God how long are you in town for? Oh just a couple weeks. I have to know something. I was just thinking the other day. Are you writing for that Zine, Olive Juice? Yeah you've seen it? Yeah totally. This guy I once dated once said that to me. Olive juice. Steve Jane, Jane Steve. Hi Steve. You two now each other? Well. I don't know you know. It's kind of up for grabs whether we know each other. Steve is that guy that I lost my virginity to. Do you remember that article I wrote about that horrible, horrible thing that happened in the cemetery? Well I remember it because it was like easily the worst night of my whole life. But Steve doesn't seem to remember it because I don't know why. But you know I remember it. He you know just has a little bit of a problem. Hi Steve. How could you not remember you idiot? Well. Jane what are you doing right now? I am having coffee over there with Ryan. Ryan? Yeah. Oh my God I love him. You want to come hang out with us? Yes totally. Steve, fuck you. Hey Ryan is it okay if Alison comes with us to go bowling? It's great, it'll be fun. Ready to go? Yeah let's go. Pardon me ma'am I need to ask you a question. Is this a family picture? Would it be safe to bring young children here? Is there any nudity? Is there any graphic violence? That's too bad. Nudity we have a real problem with. But graphic violence can help build strong character just like it does on television. We are also working on the school curriculum to make sure that the spelling books do not mention warlocks or witches. We want to get rid of Halloween so that our children are not exposed to anybody dressed as a devil or a witch. Listening to so much rock music or watching movies with adultery in them and lustful kissing. If people aren't exposed to this day after day after day, until they think that lustful kissing is acceptable, then perhaps they will love, well turn out a little more like we are. And everybody will be happy. If you're Jewish that's not not, not too big a problem. We've been able to cure many Jews and homosexuals over the years. My own daughter once told me that she thought she was a lesbian and we found a private hospital for her. And within a month or two she was back to normal again. Wouldn't you rather be happy and worry free and know that somebody up there is taking care of you? Maybe you'd like to come to a meeting of ours after you're off of work tonight where we can talk more about the coming reconstruction and the return of Jesus Christ where all the world will be governed by Old Testament law. And finally we can bring back executions for witchcraft, and homosexuality, and abortions, and also for unruly children. Red Dawn, now that's the film that's got a fable to it. It's got a moral tone and it's something everybody could relate to. The Communists invade America and parachute straight into the high school and the people with leadership qualities, you know the quarterback and the head boy, and some of their girlfriends they load up a pickup truck with ammo and Cheerios and they go into the mountains and hold off Russian battalions all through the film. They finally are defeated but they gave their life not only for America, but for God as well. And you know by the end the way the sun shines on their monument that they're in Heaven now. And this is something that that all kids could look up to and be inspired by instead of just hanging out in malls, or record stores, or something like that. We intend to clean up this community and you're either, you're either on the bus or you're off the bus. We have sympathizers in the police department too. We've spotted satanic graffiti like that so called peace sign on bridges. And they're very concerned there may be a cult here. So I would suggest you think carefully about the material you're showing in this theater so that it doesn't encourage this sort of thing. And stop selling paint to children too. That's enough. You're so weird.
