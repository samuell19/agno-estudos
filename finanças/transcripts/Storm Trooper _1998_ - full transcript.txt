Two got away. Find them. Kreigal says two of them got away. What the hell they doin' down here anyway? [groaning] Have you found them, Kreigal? We had the, sir. But they got away. Got away? Yes, sir. They offered maximum resistance. Just find them. Yes, sir. We're trapped. Not yet. [gun shot] This way. Freeze! [gun shots] [gun shots] Get up. Go. I'm not leaving without you. Just go! I'll be back for you. I'll find you! What a waste. You two stay here. Come on. I think we got it under control. So? We got one of them. And the other? Get out of the way. Hey! [thwack] [gun shots] Son of a bitch! Rocky? Rocky? [dog barking] Rocky. Come here, boy. Come on. Come here. Hey, hey, hi, hon. How you doin'? Arrrgh, got you. Rocky, stay. Stay Aren't you gonna give me a kiss? Now that wasn't hard now, was it? NO. No. No. What's with all the wet stuff? I'm just so lonely. Oh, Grace. Don't start that shit again. [dog barking] Shh, Rocky. Stay. [dog barking] What did I tell you about that goddamned dog? He's just protective of me. Well, good. I'm glad he's protective of you. If you can't control him, I'm gonna have to put him down. Don't hurt him. He's the only thing I've got left. Oh, for Christ's sake, Grace. Look at yourself. Where's your damn self-respect? I want to go back to LA. Now, Grace, why the hell would you want to do that? Don't you remember what it was like? Yeah, I remember. I remember everything. Do you? Yeah, I do. Gracey, get your ass in the house. I'm hungry. [thunder] COMMAND BASE OPERATOR: Command base, may I have your code? C1. Give me the general. COMMAND BASE OPERATOR: Uh, hold on, please. General Gardner. COMMAND BASE OPERATOR: I have General Beckett on the line for you. I'll connect you now. What's the progress? We captured one of them, but the other one escaped the compound. Escaped? Yes, sir. Escaped. GENERAL GARDNER: Do you have any idea what this means? You know, if-- if word leaks out about this operation of yours, why it's gonna make those Watergate conspirators look like a bunch of choirboys next to us. We're going to be crucified. GENERAL BECKETT: I understand. We've got our best people working on this. We're 100 miles from nowhere. He can't get far. - Yeah. Well, he already got out of the compound, didn't he? I'd say that's far enough. You're a real disappointment to me, Beckett. I'm sorry, sir. Yeah, well bein' sorry doesn't get the job done, does it? So do it, or you face the consequences. Consequences? I don't stutter, General. You know what this means, don't you? Yes, sir. [thunder] What are you doin', Grace? I don't know. You don't know. You're just sitting here looking at yourself in the mirror? Well, you mind scootin' over a little bit? I need to get myself showered and shaved for work. Taking over Silverman's midnight shift tonight. I think we could use the extra cash. You know, I am starving. What'd you cook for dinner? Uh-- What? I just didn't get to it yet. Grace, what the fuck you mean you just haven't got around to it yet? Hm? Huh? Well, I mean, uh-- Well, you what? Grace, I am out there busting my fucking ass every goddamn night and day. And to provide for who? For you. Now, at least you think I could get a goddamn hot meal in my own fucking house. - Yeah, yeah. Is that too much to fuckin' ask? - No, no, no, no. - Good. Now, you better get over this goddamned depression you're going through, Grace, pretty damn quick. Because I'm tired of it. Now, get out in the kitchen and make me some goddamn dinner. And I don't care what it is, OK? I don't care if it's that goddamned fucking dog of yours or what. I don't care. I'm just hungry. You understand? Do you understand? Say yes. Yes. Good. You know, Grace, sometimes I think I shoulda let you back in Los Angeles with the fucking animals. But you know what? You wouldn't survive a second without me helping you, now would you? No. Go. Go cook, go. Son of a bitch. Dinner. [thunder] [MUSIC- BOBBY TAYLOR AND CAROLYN MAJORS, "I'M BLACK AGAIN"] Yes, it's me. And I'm back again. Yes, I'm back to where it all began. Yeah, I'm back to where I belong. [softer music] Do you really need that noise? Noise? Are you outta your fuckin' mind? That's ridin' music. Plus, it keeps the blood pumped. [louder music playing] --in my orthopedic shoes-- [music stops] How you fixed for ammo anyway? All I need is one. Yeah, well, don't get too fucking cute. Kreigal says this is a bad motherfucker we chasing here. Up there. Up there. - I see him. - On the left. - I see him. - On the left. I see him. I'm on him. Like white on rice? You can save the joke, funny man. In a minutes, this brother's gonna be road kill. Kreigal, this is Gleason. We got a read on your man. Just give me the green light, and we'll take him out. Just take him down any way you can. Affirmative. Damn, that smells good. What are you makin'? Steak and eggs. Eggs. Well, sure, why not? Everything else around here is ass backwards. Might as well have my breakfast for dinner too, right? Don't forget I like my steak rare. [spits] [gun shots] What the fuck? I got a sling shot in the trunk, you want to use that? I'll nail him. I'll nail him. Just drive straight. Whatever you say, Miss. Daisy. [thump] Oh, god damn. What are you, some kind of rent-a-cop? Next time peel his fucking cap. Why didn't you check the tire? Kreigla, it's Gleason. Our car's down. Good news is suspect is going in the sector six. McCleary can head him off at Orchard road. This is the last time I send two women to do a man's job. Enough of your jerking around. Find him and eliminate him now. Yes, sir. McCleary? McCleary? Yeah, what do you want? KREIGAL: We think he's heading in your direction. It's up to you now. MCCLEARY: 10-4 base. I'll nail the little freak for you. But I want a damn big bonus when I do it. The terms will be as we discussed. You bet they will. [thunder] [thunder] What the hell's got you so jumpy? Just a storm coming. Yeah, right. Storm. Come to papa. [truck horn] I'm gonna recycle your ass. Not in this lifetime. You crazy son of a bitch. I got something for ya. Say goodbye, little hero. [explosions] [thunder] Where's the body? I don't know where the fuck the body's at. But where ever he's at, I know he's got a fucking headache. Aw, shit. That's all we need, rain. Yeah, well, it's really time to bring his ass in a bag and a toe tag. Let's go. [thunder] RANDAL: This is good, honey. Why aren't you eatin'? I'm not hungry. You know what? I bet if you took better care of yourself, you wouldn't be so damn depressed all the time. Go get me some ketchup. [thunder] [thunder] [thunder] All right, Grace. I'm going now. It's not even 10 o'clock yet. Yeah, I know. I got things to take care of before my shift. I bet you do. What's that supposed to mean? Do you think I don't know where you go when you work these double shifts? Now, you don't know what the hell you're talking about. Oh, yes I do. Do you think I don't know what you do? Well, I've had it. I want a separation. What are you fucking crazy, huh? I'm working all these fucking shifts just to take care of goddamned ass, to cover all these damn-- just to take care of you and so you can be fuckin' safe! Well, I might be crazy. But I am not stupid. You always insist on talkin' when you get some goddamn in your goddamn head. Oh, big man with a gun. Big cop. Oh, I bet she just gets off on your big gun, doesn't she? Grace. I am going to goddamn work is where I'm going. Go to work. To tell you the truth, Randal. I don't give a shit who you screw. I just wish you'd stop screwing me. 'Cause you make me nauseous. I make you nauseous, do I? Goddamn you. Wimp. [thwack] [groaning] You can't hurt me now. 'Cause I'm already dead. My son was my life, and you took him from me. Shut up about that. You shut your fucking mouth up Kenny. No. I'm done shutting up. I wasn't driving the car, you were. Had you hadn't taken Kenny with you, he'd still be alive today. Yeah, well, you didn't seem too goddamn upset when I took him off your goddamn now, did you? You actually seemed kind of goddamned happy! Bastard! Bastard! You didn't spend any time with him! Damn you! Stop fucking blaming me! It's not my goddamned fault! You wanna blame somebody, you blame God! [choking] Damn weather. [sirens] [crash] I know you blame me for Kenny's death. I blame myself every morning. That's why I brought you out here, Grace, so nobody could hurt you. And nobody will just as long as you listen to what I tell you. God help you if you don't. [thunder] Who the hell's that? [gun shot] Lightning, asshole. Randal? Randal? Oh my god. Oh my god. Randal? Randal, please get up. I'm so sorry. [crying] [thunder] [groaning] Holy shit. OK, baby You gotta-- That was a good one. Oh, shit. Uh, OK. All right, ready? 1, 2, 3. OK. Ugh. OK, here we go. I guess not. Oh my God. Come on, Randal. Give me a little hand here. Ugh. What a mess. [thunder] [dog barking] [dog growling] [dog barking] 911 OPERATOR: 911, state your emergency. [gun shot] [dog growling] [dog barking] I'm good. [dog barking] [thunder] Oh, Rocky. What have you done? [dog barking] Come on. Come. Come. [thunder] Oh, Rocky! [dog barking] Rocky! Rocky! Rocky! Oh, god. Rocky, stop it! Stop it! Come on! Come here. Oh, god. Yuck. Rocky, easy. Now, easy. Now, damn it. Easy, I said. Come on. Now, stay in here and behave. [dog barking] I have a gun. Twitch, and I will shoot. Shit. [inaudible] He's still alive. Can you hear me? You just come just to the wrong place at the wrong time. What am I thinking? I must be losing-- OK, calm down. Think, I gotta think. OK, so think. Now, stay there. GENERAL BECKETT: I want the whole mess cleared up before sunrise. I think it's time you put a call in to Denton. You can't be serious. Face it, Kreigal. You failed. You're failing loudly now. And it's getting louder each minute. Denton and his boys can stop the bleeding. Denton's a lunatic. He'll destroy the countryside. As long as he gets the job done. Why can't we use a platoon of your men? That way we'll be covered in case this thing goes south on us. Are you completely out of your mind? I'm not even here, son. This is you we're trying to save. It's Denton or your ass. Denton it is. Good thinking. [screaming] DENTON: You don't look too good, my friend. Not good at all. But this is just simple problem, requires a simple answer. Tell me where the chip is, and I will let you go. I don't have the chip. [screaming] DENTON: All right, break. Captain Kozinski, now my team went to a lot of trouble to get you out. Now, I know that you have that chip hidden somewhere on your body. Now, I don't want to have to take you apart to get it. But I am a soldier. And I will if I have to. [spitting] KOZINSKI: You're no soldier, Denton. You're a filthy mercenary. You have no loyalties. I will not betray my people. [screaming] Captain Kozinski, for the last time, I don't particularly like this kind of thing. But now Lieutenant Michaels here, well, he's an artist at loosening tongues. And he prefers to work slowly and deliberately. Now, unless you tell me what I want to know, I'm going to turn you over to him. What's it going to be? Go to hell. Pull his head back. [screaming] MICHAELS: Sir, I think I found something. [screaming] Well, I'll be damned. I haven't seen anything like this since the Cold War ended. Now, see I told you it would have been easier my way. Wouldn't it have just been easier to tell me what I wanted to know? [phone ringing] Restrain him. I need quiet. [groaning] Yeah? KREIGAL ON PHONE: Denton, this is Kreigal. I got a runner. Can you pick him up? If the price is right. KREIGAL ON PHONE: I want it done immediately. Sounds expensive. Why don't you fax me the details? I'll decode it in the car. KREIGAL ON PHONE: How soon can you be here? [groaning] Well, I'm in the middle of something right now. I can scramble the team and see you in an hour. KREIGAL ON PHONE: Just hurry. Kreigal, I detect a little panic in your voice. We broke him. Mitchell, I did not want him killed. I'm sorry. We'll discuss it later. Right now, we've got to call in the dogs. [dog barking] Rocky, quiet! It'll just have to do. Jeez, Randal, you're a mess. I'm not doing too good either. Now, don't look. You know, Randal, you look kind of depressed. I only did it for you. The problem is what am I going to do with you? You know, this is nice. We haven't showered together for years. [thunder] [groaning] Help me. Look, I don't know what kind of trouble you're in. I don't want any. Please, help me. Just don't move. What are you, drunk? I'm hurt I think. Well, let's just take a look. OK. Try to get up. You try anything, and I will kill you. OK. Ooo. [dog whimpering] I brought you some old clothes. I think they should fit. I'm going to, uh, clean you off a little bit, see how bad off you really are. I'm not going to hurt you unless, of course, you try something. OK? Jeez, you must spend your life in the gym. I'm gonna touch your face, OK? It looks worse than it is. Underneath all this mud and dirt, you don't look too bad at all, not at all. OK. I guess that's enough. I'll be right back. Don't you move. You're not going to believe this, Randal. But I met a new man. I hope you don't think that it's too soon. Because I warned you. Believe me, I did. Well, you've really caught your dick in the wringer this time, Kreigal. I don't need any lectures from you, Denton. Just do your job. Don't worry about it. I'll put your boy in a box. He's already killed a dozen men by now, maybe more. Yeah. Well those were your men. These are mine. [dog whimpering] [thunder] What are you doing? I told you not to move. I'm sorry. I was trying to remember. Remember what? Anything. Oh, give me a break. What is your name? I don't know. [thunder] Oh, you are good. You know, your name? What is your name? Like, some people call me Grace. What do they call you? I don't know. Your shirt had a name tag on it. Convenient, huh? Stark, is that your name? I suppose it is. You know, you came in here armed to the teeth. What are you some kind of survivalist or something? I don't know. I suppose if you were, you probably wouldn't tell me anyway. Maybe you do have some kind of amnesia, or maybe this is just a really great act that I am not falling for. I don't know. Well, I know you don't know! You keep saying you don't know. I get it! I get it already! You not know! Are you angry? Are you kidding? I don't even know you are. And frankly, I don't really care. But you come into my house in the middle of the night-- in the middle of the wrong night. What do you mean? Never mind. You don't have any shoes. Shoes? Do you want some shoes? Yes. Don't move. Do you understand? I mean it. Yes. [thunder] Kreigal still has men in the field continuing their search. So let's try not to tag the wrong man. This is a high priority mission. Local authorities have not been notified. But if they become a problem, you've got my full permission to go code seven. You have a problem, soldier? Sir, permission to speak, sir. By all means. Permission to speak freely, sir. Understood. Sir, I did not join this operation to kill innocent civilians. Well, Corporal Roth, your objection is duly noted. [thwack] [groaning] Now, let's have a little understanding here. This is my mission. And when you work for me, you do things my way, or I'll carry your ass out of here in a body bag. What's it good to be, Corporal? I think we can work together on this, sir. Well, there you have it, boys and girls. Anybody else got a problem? Good. Let's move out. [thunder] Good. Perfect fit. Just about my husband's size. Where is your husband? He's around. Who is this? Give me that. I made you angry again. That was my son. He's dead. Got it? I'm sorry. I didn't mean anything by it. Yeah, well, that's exactly what the kid who shot Kenny said. He didn't mean anything by it. He meant to shoot somebody else, and Kenny just got in the way. My son was only eight years old. Eight years old. That boy will be punished for his crime. That boy will be out of jail in five years. That's justice for you. Justice? What's a person supposed to do when their reason for living has been taken away from them? You survive. How do you do that? Can you tell me? Listen, I'm really sorry that you caught me this way. But I can't help you any more than you can help me. I don't think you understand. No, I don't think that you understand. Just go. Pretend that we never met. Your life is in danger, and I want to protect you. Well, that's really all fine and good, you know? But I don't think that there's anything that you can do that can help me. What is that? What is? [gun shots] [dog barking] [screaming] Keep your head down! [gun shots] What was that? Grace, Grace, listen to me. Yeah. They're here. Mm-mm. I want you to get you gun, and crawl over behind the chair. My gun. I [inaudible] by the window. - OK, OK. I'll get it. - OK. On go. When I say go, we go. - OK, OK. - Ready? - Uh, yeah. Go. [screaming] Oh! [thwack] [gun shot] [groaning] [bones breaking] [dog growling] [gun shot] [gun shot] [groaning] Grace? You all right? [thunder] It's-- it's OK. I think it's over for now. What's over? What happened? I'm not sure. But I think there's going to be more of them. Oh, Rocky! [thunder] Looks like one of your men stopped the target here, but couldn't finish the job. Last report had them tracking him north by northwest, then the radio went dead. Let's fan out. Begin a hard target search of the area. If you make contact with the target, do not engage. I repeat, do not engage. I do not want this man to escape our perimeter. You notify me and the rest of the squad. Move out. You got any more men left alive out there, you better call 'em in. Why? They're just gonna be in our way. My men are highly skilled professionals. But if they were, you wouldn't have called me. I'm not going to stand here and argue with you. Good. Either call them in or suffer the consequences. What do you mean? I've turned these wolves loose. They're going to shoot anything that moves out there and ask questions later. Michaels. Yes, sir. I need to talk to you for a minute. Look, I've been given full clearance to kill this target. But there's a substantial cash bonus in it for all of us if we can bring him back alive. Now, I turn you loose on this guy, and he doesn't stand a chance. That's going to cost me money. Now, I need to know, can you follow orders? Of course, I can, sir. You know I-- Don't bullshit me, Michaels. Between Roth goin' soft on me and you killin' everything in sight, I'm starting to think I got in the wrong line of work. Now, I do not want to mess up this mission. So I need to know. Can you obey orders? Sir, I am a soldier. I can follow orders. Yeah, Just Like you did with Kozinski? Sir, I apologize for the incident, OK? I had no idea the guy was so fragile. He just kind of came apart. I overestimated his tolerance for pain. No, what you did was underestimate your own strength. Now, I do not want to mess up this mission. So I need to know, unequivocally, can you obey orders? Yeah. Good. You damn well better. Get the hell outta here. [crying] Grace? You're gonna have to leave this place. And where will we go? We are gonna separate. They're after me. They will kill you. Why? Who are these people? Why would they kill me? Because you've seen me. Because I've seen you? What the fuck does that mean? I don't know. You've got a very selective memory. Grace, it's not my memory. I see things in flashes. I know I was their prisoner, but I don't know why. But if you don't even know who they are or why they are after you, how do you even know there's going to be more? Do you want to stay here and take the chance that I'm wrong? No. I don't. OK. Let's go. Yeah, that's a copy. Sir. Yes, Mitchell. You know, if Roth poses a problem, I'd be more than happy to take care of him. I don't think that will be necessary, Mitchell. Besides, I'd rather you concentrate on the target. Have I ever let you down? No, you haven't. In fact, Mitchell, you've got the three qualities I admire most in a soldier, loyalty, expertise, and thirst for blood. Well, now, you can't be a great fighter unless you've got something worth fightin' for. [thunder] Don't move. What, what? They rigged the car with a grenade. GRACE: Oh, sweet Jesus. [gun shots] [screaming] [gun shots] [glass breaking] [gun shots] [glass breaking] [gun shots] [screaming] [gun shots] [gun shots] [thwack] [groaning] [groaning] [choking] [no dial tone] [groaning] [thunder] You missed one man. [groaning] [thwack] [groaning] [groaning] [thwack] [groaning] [groaning] [groaning] [gun shot] [gun shot] Stark! Is that you? Identify yourself, or I'm going to shoot! Goddamn it, why didn't you answer me? Well, I been kind busy. You're shot? Yes. Gimme this. What happened out there? How many are there? There were eight of them. Were eight? You got 'em all? Yes. What is it exactly that you said that you did? Electricity's out, and the phone is not working. Standard operating procedure. Restricts enemy's access to all communications and transportation. This looks really bad. How can you stand it? Stand it? Doesn't it hurt? Yes. Whoever trained you trained you really well. [beeping] What is that? [beeping] I-- I-- That's it. I've had enough. Who or what are you? It just happened to me in the hospital, Grace? A hospital. Yes, a hospital. They did this to me. Man, this is too fuckin' weird. Grace. Grace. Grace. [screaming] No! Grace! [struggling] No! Let go of me! They will kill you. I don't care. I do. I do. I do. Men. OK. [phone ringing] General Gardner here. GENERAL BECKETT: I have Denton and his crew on the case. The initial problem should be solved within the hour. But I think this entire incident has exposed how precarious our position is with this project. I think we need to make an immediate correction in our policy. What do you suggest? I feel we should terminate this operation before it gets out of control. We've got $6 billion wrapped into your operation there, General. And now you want us to just let everything go right down the drain, because you lost your handle on the situation? Is that it? If we cut our losses now, we can walk away with our careers intact. All right, and what is your suggested course of action? Oh, an industrial accident of some sort, an explosion, something big. Wipe out the plant and everyone and everything in it. Well, I will, uh, give that some thought, General. Meanwhile, do nothing. Retrieve the soldier. And you wait for further instructions, understand? Yes, sir. He's gone quite insane. You'll have to intercede. How long will it take you to get to the plant? I can take an F14, be there before sunrise. All right. General Beckett, he's a patriot, one of this country's great heroes. I want you to show him the proper respect. I'll handle the matter with velvet gloves. All right. Oh, Caulder. You know what I find most repellent about the agency you work for? What's that, sir? How easy it is for you boys to do the hard thing. Someone's got to do it. Don't they, sir? Yes. Someone's got to do it. ROTH: Omega to home base. Omega to home base. That's a copy, Omega. What's your 20? I'm standing at the target point. Brasha, Stinson, and Berg have been neutralized along with bravo group. We've located the target. Should we move in? Negative. You engage combat only if target attempts escape. Everybody maintain positions. I'm coming in. Copy. [thunder] Did you hear that? We heard. Well, what are you waiting for? Let's hit it. You secured the target. We'll mop up the mess when you're done. Kreigal, you got the heart of a [inaudible] And I plan on keeping it. [thunder] It's a prosthetic device. You were bleeding. It's a lubricant of some sort. I can still move my arm. But I can't feel anything. So what do we do now? I'm going to leave. I'm the target. I'm the one they want to kill. Your best chances of survival are to hide in the woods. Oh, great. So I squat in the woods all night like Pocahontas, then what? As soon as I can, I will alert the right authorities. And what are you going to tell them? You don't even know who's chasing you. These people, they're not the police. They make their own rules, own laws. That's why I had to escape from them. And you just remembered that? Yes. They had me in a hospital, and they did things to me. And when I escaped, people got hurt. No shit. Well, people are still getting hurt. There was another one with me, my friend. A woman? Yes. We have to leave. It's a complete breakdown. She as scrambled as yesterday's eggs. Looks bad. - They found the other one yet? - I'm not sure. [thunder] It's too late. They're here. Get away from the window. Why aren't they attacking us? Because they're waiting for more men. They want to make certain this time. Son of a bitch. Son of a bitch. I am so tired of being scared. [gun shots] OK. I'm scared. I'm scared. [gun shots] Ceasefire, ceasefire. Vargas? Yes, sir. Use the XR5. But, sir, that might contaminate-- Just do it. Yes, sir. Don't move. No problem. [gun shot] Put this on for protection. What about you? I'll take care of it. I want you to go to the bedroom. Stay there. Go. [coughing] Roth, you got anything? That's a negative, sir. No activity. Might have gotten lucky. Don't count on it. Mitchell, how about you? Nothing, sir. No movement whatsoever. ROTH: I say we blow the house. Forget that. They want this guy intact. Then we're moving in. Soon, people, very soon. Just sit tight and hold your current positions. Stark. Yeah. You all right? Yeah. What now? We let them come to us. They think we're dead. I'm beginning to believe that, too. Not yet. How many do you think there are? Four, maybe five. When do you think they're going to stop coming? When they've succeeded. So we are dead. You want to give up No. Let's take as many of them as we can. All right. Sun will be coming up soon. This place is going to be buzzing with locals. It's time to hit this house now, people, hard and fast. Vargas, you ready for an adrenaline fix? Been dying for it, sir. All right, people. Lock and load on a three count. 1. 2. 3. [glass breaking] [punching and groaning] [bones breaking] [punching and groaning] [gun shots] [thwack] Ugh. [glass breaking] [gun shots] Ow, fuck. Fucking bitch, you shot me! What are you gonna do about it? You'll never make it. Try me. [gun shot] [moaning] I married a cop. Did you get them all? I got one, too. [gun shots] Stark! [gun shots] Freeze! Drop the gun. Target is neutralized. Location is secure. You can come in now, Kreigal. Be there in five. Ow. Ow, Jesus. Ow. Who else did he make contact with? Huh? Was anybody else here? Did anybody leave this place after he arrived? No. Who are you? Let me ask the questions. Where's the kid? - What? - The kid in this picture. Where is he? He's dead. I'm sorry about that. Sorry? [thwack] Easy, easy. Now, fucker, I got a million goddamned questions to ask you before I blow you to hell. Who are you? Denton. My name is Denton. I don't care about your name. What are you, and why are you here? I was hired to plug a security leak, to kill that freak in your bathroom. Why? What did he do? He's just an experiment that got away. What kind of experiment? He's the corporation's answer to a dwindling police recruitment, a cyborg, robot. Do I look like an idiot to you? You mean you couldn't tell? You didn't notice the way he moved, the way he spoke? What about it. He was designed to be the ultimate cop, judge, jury, and executioner all rolled into one tight package. Except the corporation went too far. They planned on using him for covert operations. He's an assassin, not a cop. Yeah. But you see, his-- his data banks, they recognized the contradiction, and they rebelled. It was a little programming snag they didn't count on. Your boyfriend in there is too good of a cop. He's not a cop. I know cops. He didn't know shit about the law. Yeah, well, his systems were scrambled during the escape. But he's a fully self-repairing unit. I mean, he-- he woulda been back online in-- in maybe two or three days. What kind of crazy garbage is this? What are you telling me? I've had it. [clicking] This is not my day. [thwack] Ugh. You owe me, Denton. It's about time you showed up. I was starting to run out of story. If she'd been any kind of a pro, I'd be dead by now. Well, that's your fault. Where's our man? In the bathroom. I told you not to leave him unattended. Well, he's as dead as a doorknob. You cannot kill what's never been alive. He's a machine. He needs to be switched off. You watch her. You two come with me. At least Denton got two of them. GENERAL BECKETT: Yes? We got him. He's down and out. How should I proceed? Cancel his contract. Cleanse the landscape. No witnesses, no prisoners. Just get it done. It's a done deal. I've been hearing that all night. Kreigal, she's comin' to. What do you want me to do with her? Kill her. Kill them both. [gun shots] I can hear a fly shit in the woods from a mile away. Now, what am I going to do with you? Drop dead. Not just yet. [beeping] You are under arrest for assaulting a police officer. Do not resist. Do not resist. [bones breaking] [beeping] [beeping] Kreigal, come on out. I've got the girl. And we both know enough to put you away for life if we walk out of here. God. You stay down there, honey. This'll all be over soon. Kreigal, don't make me come in after you. [gun shots] [punching and groaning] [punching and groaning] Thank god you're alive. Are you OK? [beeping] What? (DEEP ROBOT VOICE) You are charged with the murder of your husband Randal Tolson. What? (DEEP ROBOT VOICE) You are under arrest. No! (DEEP ROBOT VOICE) You have the right to remain silent. You have the right to an attorney. Let go of my hand. (DEEP ROBOT VOICE) If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be provided for you. Ow, you're hurting me. I don't want any goddamn attorney. Let go of my arm! (DEEP ROBOT VOICE) You have waived your right to an attorney. No! (DEEP ROBOT VOICE) This court finds you guilty as charged. The sentence for this crime, death. No! Ugh. (DEEP ROBOT VOICE) Execution to commence immediately. [thunder] [explosion] [explosion] [explosion] [mechanical sounds] [splashing] [gasp] No. [groaning and heavy breathing] No. No. No! [screaming] Get off me! [choking] [mini explosion] They will come for you, Grace. You must fight them. Fight them. [screaming] [crying] Put the phone down, General. Who the hell are you? My name is Ry Caulder. I've been sent here to terminate your command. Terminate my command? That's preposterous. The paperwork is on your desk, sir. You can't be serious. I'm afraid I am. This is damage control. Please do not delay. I have much to do. I'm calling General Gardner. I want to know that he authorized this. General Gardner will not be accepting any phone calls. He finds the entire situation unacceptable. [phone ringing] You bastards can't do this to me. This was my project, my brainchild. That is precisely why you must resign. Don't add disgrace to your list of failures, General. What about my children? What will they think? What will history make of me? That you died a hero. [gun shot] [phone ringing] Gardner. CAULDER: General Beckett was cleaning his gun, and it went off. Right. [beeping] Help me. [gun shot] [thunder] [engine revving] [beeping] [explosion] STARK: They will come for you, Grace. Fight them. You must fight them. Fight them. Fight them. [theme music]
