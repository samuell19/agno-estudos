Secretary? Captain. (gasping) Nurse can you help her? Right away sir. Navigation, where are we? God knows. There are no charts for this area. Engineering, Jim what shape are we in?

Jim, how's the laser? Dead. Mike, you've cost us one of the few remaining weapons that we have. By doing that you've reduced our chances of survival by one gun. You're an officer, behave like one.

It enables a person to complete his daily tasks with strength, energy and a cheerful attitude. Funny I don't feel a bit cheerful. How about the equipment? What all did we salvage? Well aside from the two remaining lasers, we have some food, some survival equipment but not much else. What about the signal mirrors? We'll need those. We may have to send out scouting parties and they may be the only means of communication I have left. Here, we've got four. This one's for you. I'm a technician. Not explorer. Never had much survival training. They never covered this type of situation at the space center. Hey, you'll do fine. How is he? Fine. A little shock. He'll come out it. Why? He's not missing anything. Where are we going captain, and why? To find a good place to make a permanent camp. Until we can be rescued. Oh yeah? When's that gonna be? I don't know. Until we're rescued, we'll use the survival tools we have and live off the land as best we can. (laughing) Live off the land? What are we a bunch of racoons? Why don't we just go somewhere and ask somebody for some help? I didn't plan this Mr. Bailor! Perhaps if your company had been more careful how they built reactors, maybe we wouldn't be in this type of situation. We're obviously miles from any intelligent habitation, Mr Bailor. If there is any at all on this planet. We'll be fine. We'll just take one day at a time. They'll find us! We're never going to be found. We're going to stay here. Like Cindy.

There's nothing we can do for him now. ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ What do we do now Jim? We plant stakes in the ground. Big ones. Tips with the poison from the berries. Then we lower the beast onto it. And if it's angry enough and as stupid as I think it is, it will impale itself on the poison stakes. We'll let's get to work! Where do we start? ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ We're leaving the valley. Where are we going Lee? Away from that. Where are we going? There's a valley west of here. I scouted it yesterday. We'll be safe there? You guarantee us? Completely safe. No more spiders. No more dinosaurs. All peace and quiet just over the next hill? You're not risking anymore lives trying to kill that thing. We're leaving here. Lee you are a fool. I'm taking everyone and we're leaving here! Go ahead and run Lee. You've got a whole damn world to run in, but you're gonna have to run alone. We're not going with you. I'm in charge here. You'll do as I say. Stop working. Pack up, we're leaving. Nobody's going. No one's listening to you anymore. You're just another guy around here. That uniform means nothing. Maybe this means something. I say we go. I'm the leader here. If you think different Lee, prove it! I've always said you had to fight what for you really wanted. Sometimes aggression is necessary. I was right. But I won't fight you. Not now. Not while that beast is still alive. (growling) He's coming! He'll snatch everything. All our wood and we're not ready. Steve!
