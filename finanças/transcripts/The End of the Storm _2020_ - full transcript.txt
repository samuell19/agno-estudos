I'm not the... smartest person on this planet. I'm not the most skilled person on this planet. I, um... I'm not the best looking or whatever. I don't have the best background. All these kind of things. But it's not a problem at all. My two best friends had the best grades from the whole school and we were learning together and I was not even close to them and I didn't think, "I'm a bit... dumb" or whatever. I just took it like it is and knew that's my basis from here, I have to jump. What I want to say with it is I always felt support from people from my friends, from my family all the way through. When you walk through a storm and there are different storms out there that's the moment when you need support. and I really love the fact that there is a song about my way of life. How I understand life. You'll never walk alone. It was not the reason why I came here. It's a pure coincidence. It's my anthem for years and years. I think it's in one of the most beautiful songs ever. That's it. So here we are. and it's a pretty good fit. Liverpool Football Club, it means life. Honestly. My grandfather followed Liverpool all over Europe. It's just ingrained in us. People used to say "What was the secret Liverpool Football Club?" If they had a secret, we wouldn't tell you. The supporters have always had huge effect. The death toll from the stadium disaster stands at 96. When Liverpool play it's a combination of excitement and fear. You never know what's gonna happen. Joy for Manchester United! I was six when we last won the league and to be honest, I don't remember it. Ryan Giggs has scored! It seems to me like they don't really like football. It's not a big team anymore. Gerrard, with the shot. Oh, what a goal! Oh, Gerrard slipped. And Demba Ba's in here! Ba punishes, of all people... Steven Gerrard. I just cried and cried and cried and I just felt like my entire world had come crashing down. Big breaking news for the Premier League. Brendan Rodgers has left Liverpool. Where do they go next then? I would go for Klopp. Liverpool appears to be closing in on a new manager. The German Jurgen Klopp. The day that Jurgen was appointed I said "Fasten your seat belts. We're off and running here". He's a breath of fresh air. He said that he's going to win us the Premiership. It's what we want. In this moment, we are not the best team in the world. They don't believe in this moment, yeah? So they only want to see, OK, five years ago ten years ago, 20 years ago. History is great, but it's only to remember. Now we have the possibility to write a new story. Jurgen Klopp arriving here at the Lane. He's a manager who's worked wonders in the Bundesliga. Twice managing Dortmund to the League Championship there. Can he bring similar successes to Merseyside? Usually in life you have to fulfil first and foremost your own expectations. But when you come to Liverpool, then it's completely different because there's so many people dream about our success. Winning trophies is fulfilling the expectations of the people. My first game at Tottenham I always watched the other team warming up. Tottenham, they're good looking. Dark blue. Harry Kane, Dele Alli. Everything looks set. You turn around. Wow! We all look like Captain Picard. The wrong sizes, they didn't fit really the players. I was not happy. And I thought: how can you be... the game didn't even start, being already the second best. - : It's Harry Kane and this is N'Jie with the finish! So next day, I asked for a meeting and said, "Hey, come on. What can we change immediately?" Because I really think that these kind of things are important. He's gonna break for Harry Kane! I'm not a control freak. I just think things should happen in a specific way. Forward looking for Ighalo. Who is really quick and persistent. And he reaps the reward! Well, Lallana with the header. You do sense that Liverpool will eventually create something. They've still not had a shot on target. We have some problems. You have to solve them. So I need help. Of course, we have to find good defenders good strikers, good midfielders. The breaking news is that Liverpool have completed the signing of Sadio Mane from Southampton. Sigurdsson... looking deep for Fernandez, who wins it and it's still not away and it's in by Fernando Llorente. It's a lovely ball as well. It's two! That was poorly defended by Liverpool. We need a leader, at the back. Big transfer story tonight. Liverpool have got their man, Virgil van Dijk. I'm not a genius, so I cannot do it alone. Oh, Karius has lost it! And it's in by Nathan Ake! It is just a horrible, horrible day for Liverpool. Liverpool have confirmed the world record for a goalkeeper signing of Alisson from Roma. Morning. As captain of a football club like Liverpool what your role is, what you're here to do is get the best out of yourself get the best out of the team. Setting the standard making sure you've given everything every single day. And eventually you'll get your rewards. But, it doesn't stop here. You know, you gotta keep going. You gotta keep improving. It's never easy in pre-season. You start from scratch. What happened three weeks ago, four weeks ago, is gone. Winning the Champions League was a dream come true for myself. The celebration we had with the fans, the parade. Definitely, I want to experience this again. Champions of Europe. But it's all about being Champions of England now surely. Last year we had the determination we had the desire, the emotion, the passion. The boys played an exceptional season. But we have to make the next step. Coming out on top again in the Premier League, Manchester City! Last year... the Premier League, City was just a little bit better. A lot of it is mentally how we deal with things under pressure. What up and good morning! We're back in Nazare. I remember I saw a little video on social media. Someone on a wave and the wave was miles in the air. We're going to take you guys with us to show you a little bit about Nazare and the preparations before the season starts. Sebastian Steudtner is a German guy. He's the world's best high wave surfer. Wow. He's all the time in a life-threatening situation. And if he surfs the highest wave he ever saw then he's looking for the next highest wave and he's waiting for that the whole year. Maybe two years, maybe three years. It's just so obvious where the similarities are. So we met him. I was very, very interested in what he had to say about how he deals with pressure. He's like you need to do one little slight mistake and life could be over. Shall we swim? After that, we went to the pool and did a little bit of breathing techniques. You had to stay underwater for as long as you can and I remember I was there for maybe 30 seconds and that was long for myself and he said certain things that you can do and then try again. He explained them how to cool down your mindset how to bring yourself in maybe a happier place that you can do that longer. I remember the change was already massive and there were some players that were down for two or two and a half minutes on the water almost three minutes, and I was like, how? That was absolutely incredible. We had players. They did it for three minutes, then. Three minutes after half an hour teaching. That only means that you can much more perform than you ever imagined. It's Neil Atkinson and John Gibbons with the Anfield Wrap. Do you know how many supporters we've got worldwide? Close to 100 million. Believe it or not it is 450 million people on the globe. It's about six o'clock in the morning and it's going to be a big, big turnout and we're all... all very excited. So we woke up early to come to the pub to watch the game and then we're going straight to school. Watching Liverpool on the weekends it's a family time. I usually watch either Salah or Mane because we are both strikers. I watch and learn and then I put it in games. Going to the match with your son is just the most special thing. We normally get in half an hour before stand on The Kop, then you sing the songs. When the ball hits the net, it's incredible. It's an absolutely special feeling. There's no place in the world I'd rather be than at Anfield with my ten-year-old. It's a while ago that we played at Anfield. You have to make Anfield a fortress again. Using your own crowd, using the atmosphere. - : Come on, boys, come on! - : Here they come. It all starts here. You need to get into a rhythm. You need to get into a groove. You see me always looking at the Kop when they play the song because I just want to soak it in, enjoy it. The Premier League season is underway for Liverpool. There's a long road ahead. Who knows what waits at the end of that road. You can never guess with this football club that's for sure. Robertson. Origi, it's a lovely ball by Roberston really got some weight on it gives Origi something to work with. And he does! The first goal of Liverpool's new season! - It's an own goal. Divock Origi! - Salah gets it. Deflection takes it to Firmino, Salah's in! Goal for Liverpool! Goal for Mohamed Salah. Buendia. Stiepermann. Carried away by Alisson. No problem for 'em. He's scored one. Now, can Salah assist one? Oh, there it is! Virgil van Dijk, opening night! How about that! Bang! It's now Liverpool three, Norwich City nil. He's put the ball at his feet. Goal kick. Now there is a concern for Liverpool. Golden glove winner last season played every minute of the Premier League. It doesn't bode well for Alisson Becker this. Don't know what it is. It's a slip, isn't it? Straight away put his hands to his knee. If you ask me what could have been worse. Nothing, pretty much. The situation was especially difficult because I think two weeks before... Simon Mignolet came in my office and told me, "Boss, I have a big opportunity. I can go back to Belgium. I can play for Club Brugge and I really want to do that". You know, that's pretty late, we start next week! "Yeah, I know, but it's I want to go back. Spoke to my wife". OK. No problem. Ali is fit. Number three goalkeeper in that moment. Caoimhin Kelleher had a bicycle accident on holiday. Broke his... I think his hand, which is really bad for a goalie. So you go through the market, bam-bam-bam you look, which goalkeeper's free and is good especially but good and free. To give him his full title Adrian San Miguel del Castillo thirty-two years old from Seville. He never expected a club the stature of Liverpool to come for him. Adrian trained for four days, five days with us. Before that, he trained by himself. He didn't play for a year and then first game, Alli kicks the ball, and out. And then wow. And we had no time to have these individual talks and stuff like this because it was like... Well they're coming again here Norwich. Great save by the goalkeeper. Save from Adrian. That's the unbelievable difficult situation. Like getting from the sofa and putting your best performance ever on the pitch and that's what he did. Well, quite the start for Liverpool. First three points of the new season are theirs. Ward Prowse to deliver. Comes all the way to-- That's an astonishing save by Adrian. Valeri. That's a really good stop by Adrian. Liverpool's great start to the new season continues. Seven players on this side eight players on the far side. Both of you ready to receive behind the cones. So here Adam ready. Now be ready because you can play here or there. And from there, we start. Pretty much everything in football is about organisation and defending. Because even when you are attacking you need players who are prepared for the moment when we have to defend again. Trent, no here, support! Form some support lines! Support! So defending is incredibly important. You can only feel free in life if you have kind of protection. Not on the same line, Trent! What I want us to be is feeling completely free because we know whatever mistake we make there is at least one, two three guys who will sort that in first instance for us. Trent! Support here. We want to have as many players as possible who can completely focus on the offensive situation. And it's on to Sadio Mane. Absolutely delightful. Mane is my favourite player because he's really fast. He's a really great winger. On towards Mane! Oh yes! Salah. Firmino, ah, brilliant. Salah... Salah! Mo Salah, coming into the area. Mo Salah coming through! I love the fact that we are so much multi-culti. Having I would say the best ambassadors for being a Muslim in the team is really great. I think I need better opponent. Robbo always lose. Muslims wash their body very often in specific situations. Before warming up, after warming up stuff like this, it takes time. And so we decided to do things differently. It's really not a problem, we only adjusted our-- when do we arrive in a stadium and when do we go back in the dressing room after warming up to these rituals? It costs us exactly two minutes. And it's easy to give these two minutes away that they can do what is in this moment for them absolutely important. Brendan Rodgers' first return to Anfield almost four years to the day since his departure has made Leicester City contenders once again. And with that in mind, Leicester will be a real threat to Liverpool's perfect start to the season today. It's obviously four years since Brendan Rodgers left Liverpool. So what kind of welcome can he expect on his first return to Anfield? The reception, I think, will be good from us. But still, is that not a friendly game? Potential from Mane. Really, really good. The most obvious thing, what people see that I am very animated, constantly grinding my teeth and stuff like this. I cannot look overnight like a thinker. Standing the 90 minutes out there and watching a game like this and everybody thinks "Oh, obviously something must be going on his mind". Then specific moments I still look like a complete idiot on the side-line. I know that. I had my moments. That's why I'm probably still a record holder in Germany for red cards for managers and for sure I paid them the highest fines in the history of German Bundesliga. Irony doesn't help as well, on the side-line, obviously. So the referees cannot really deal with that. I said once I think my first red card as a coach I got I went to the linesman and ask him how many wrong decisions are allowed. Because if it's 15, we have one left. And he raised his flag and I was already on the way to the stands. But I calmed down. Working harder. Oh, that's broken through. It's broken through for Sadio Mane! Just unstoppable. Albrighton has nicely picked out Ayoze Perez. And here's the chance for Maddison! And it's James Maddison who gets it through the goalkeeper to level things up for Leicester City. Hamza Choudhury will step on for James Maddison the goal scorer. Salah with Soyuncu. Salah's done it... Is Mo OK? What's the latest? How can he be OK? He limping off the pitch you ask me if he's OK? How can he be OK? Did you watch it back? It would be... What do you think? Well, he was caught from behind. But I just wondered if you got an update in terms of what the injury is. What has he got? We don't know. How should I know now, huh? Makes me very angry. I have no problem with challenges in football because it's a contact sport. But this boy I was very angry with because two weeks before, he injured another player and he came on and was overly aggressive. In these moments, I'm really angry. I can't describe it in a different way because it's the 100% truth. I don't like it. Salah's day is done. I cannot really deal with unfairness when I feel it's unfair for some reason, these are things I cannot really... I couldn't at all deal with. Origi. Lovely piece of control. Really good cover. Oh, where you going? It's Mane, goes down penalty kick for Liverpool! Here comes the late drama! He's touched him there! Penalty kick! Liverpool have done it again. Jurgen Klopp's men make it eight from eight with astonishing late drama at Anfield. I've always loved Liverpool. I've always supported them. I wouldn't dream about playing somewhere else. The main message that kids should be picking up from my story is that it's, anything's possible anything can happen because I said before that I was I was once that kid in a Gerrard or Carragher shirt. When I was six or seven there was like a summer camp going on at the Academy. Liverpool sent invites to my school. The teacher said, "Who wants to go?" And every person's hand went up in the room. Luckily, my name was picked out of a hat. I always got told I had a lot of potential and I never, ever wanted to waste that. They have a excellent scouser playing full back in your team. With the number of assists and goals that he's done and the success he's had it's brilliant for people because they can relate to the person. But the ability comes first and foremost. Not your birthplace. I grew up understanding the values of the club the history, the tradition the things that have happened in the past. Using that anger and disappointment is motivation to put Liverpool back amongst the best teams in the world. Next challenge, Manchester United. We have to be very, very focussed. We have to be emotional. Big pressure game. History is really important. We never won there since I am in... Let's try it, at least, for the first time. When you're playing for Liverpool you understand that Old Trafford... it's one of the most difficult grounds you'll ever play at. It's a bitter rivalry with Man U. I understood it from an early age. They said that we are the perfect opponent now. I don't think there are a lot of teams who would love to play against us in a moment. It looks like Man United is the only one... and we have to make sure that that is a misunderstanding. Mo Salah's injury against Leicester keeps him out of the side today. But the good news for Liverpool is that Alisson Becker is back. Well, there's an old saying in football "The most dangerous and toughest game is your next game". Certainly Jurgen Klopp and Liverpool will be taking nothing for granted at all. It's more than a normal game. It's more than a normal rivalry. Mane... now, Manchester United are trying to get players back Liverpool are trying to get players forward. It's Firmino. Here comes Daniel James. Rashford goes now. Rashford's there and scores. So it's Marcus Rashford's goal, it's Manchester United's lead. Going there, to Old Trafford, always tough. When you're not winning, it's about not getting too low. Even though I wear the armband, so many other captains and leaders throughout the dressing room. We have a leadership group. With me, Gini, Hendo and Millie. We are the main four that the manager likes to speak to and communicate with. We had a vote. They were the four people that were chosen. I think we're all different characters and we all can lead in different ways. As a centre back you play on a position where you have the view of the whole pitch. But whether it is a left winger or a striker or back the goalie, you know, everyone, you can reach with my voice at least. It's a good adrenaline and I want people to shout at me as well when I'm doing something right. You have to be open and honest with each other. You have to tell everyone the truth. Lallana, who's had such a retched time with injuries over the last couple of years. the majority sending Henderson on his way Whenever I come off I find it difficult, you know. It's hard when that does happen. But it's not always about the starting eleven. It's your whole squad. That's what wins you trophies. This is Robertson. To Lallana! Goal for Liverpool! Goal for Adam Lallana! What a moment to come from the bench and to score at Old Trafford. It's honours even at Old Trafford. The winning run comes to an end. Pretty much everything went against us. Our own performance in the first half as well and we still got beat and could have won the game so this part of the assessment, I'm fine with the performance of the first half, of course not. That's just not how it should be. Despite how passionate India is about cricket Calcutta specifically loves football. Forty-five years ago, there was hardly any television and I used to follow all the Saturday commentaries on the radio. The first club which came to my awareness was Liverpool. The earliest memories we have is with our dad sitting in his lap watching Liverpool games. Dad taught us to share in his passion. Come on, guys. Come on, Mane. - Mane come on! Most of our conversations are always bonding about football. Seriously, again? Bobby is having an off day. Even if we don't speak for maybe two or three days or something, it's almost religious. We have to interact at the time of the game with a little bit of banter. Take it off, man! Liverpool really brings this family together. Klopp for me is really special is that he actually embodies the spirit of just togetherness of completion, of being a family. Not just to the players it's to the whole Liverpool community. Schaffe, schaffe Hausle baue that describes the people from my area... pretty good. They don't know exactly how to rest. On a Saturday morning, that's a tradition there you clean the street pretty much in front of your house. So if you don't do that the only excuse or explanation was you died overnight. And that was not my character, to be honest. My mum was just a typical Black Forest mum. Caring, loving. Full of trust and faith. Whatever happened out there, you come home and she loves you anyway. Unfortunately, when I describe my dad in the end when I read it from time to time it's not fair how it sounds. This relationship was much more based on respect and clear messages. He was an unbelievable football player. Kaiserslautern was a big, big club in Germany. Offered him a contract when he was 18. But my granddad was, "You don't go for this football you learn something serious" and didn't allow him to join them. He wanted me to fulfil his dreams. I loved all the things he wanted me to do. But then, of course it's one thing that you love doing it and the other thing is that your dad coach, whatever you want to say he's not happy with the steps you do. His style was a little bit more about criticism than about giving praise for what you did. But it's a generation, question of generation. I mean, I told my dad that I would study sports science. He was completely on fire. He said, "Yes, do that". He had no idea what I could do with it. But it was the first kid of the family who studied at all. So he was like, "Yeah. Do that". I know exactly what he wanted me to do being really successful in sports. He had to deal with the average football player. And the... the real the shame of this story is that he didn't that he wasn't, erm here anymore when I became a manager. A huge game. How do you see it? This game doesn't need any build up. It will have a huge impact on who wins the league. These are two, I think quite unique teams we have at the moment. If Liverpool wins the game today I think they will win the league. Man City, what they've done over the years has been incredible. Mostly, they won the league, then last year. England's highest quality title race of all time. Coming out on top again in the Premier League Manchester City. We all know how massive the game was because if you want to become champions you have to win at least that game at home against them. We have to play our best game. Everybody in the stadium has to be in absolutely top shape. The guys who sell the hotdogs has to be in a top shape. Come early in the stadium, get your food and go in wait for the team. We invest already all our emotions before the game and let's play football. You know, there's a lot at stake, of course. The focus has got to be on what you need to do as a team. It's not really on what's happened in the past. It's only a distraction, really. For so many years, I've seen setbacks and difficult moments throughout my time at Liverpool. But it's how you react from them moments and how you just keep going. When I first come in, I was a young player. Kenny helped us very much, tried to settle in and knew how big Liverpool was. When you come in to a new football club it's not easy. That's a little bit tame from Jordan Henderson. He was 19 years of age, I think. Every mistake he made, he thought it was his fault. And that's Reina beaten! It's Yaya Toure! Manchester City. Top of the Premier League. The team loses the games and the team wins again. Destroying yourself is not going to be helpful to you or anybody. With Jordan, he just needed a little cuddle sometimes. I can become quite emotional within games which sometimes isn't good. It's Henderson. Oh, he's heavy with the touch- and he could be in trouble there, Jordan Henderson. That was a big moment. I got sent off late on in the game. I knew from that point I was gonna miss the next three or four games which was gonna be tough especially with what we were going for you know, something that I'd always dreamed of doing. That was probably the turning point of the season. If Liverpool win today it means that only Manchester City will be able to come between Liverpool and the first Premier League title. Oh, and Gerrard slipped! And Demba Ba's in here! Ba punishes, of all people... Steven Gerrard. To lose that game was tough. And then the Palace game shortly after. Chance here. Gayle! 3-3! Dwight Gayle may just have blown Liverpool right out of the title picture. I found it difficult to deal with because I was so young and never really experienced that before. And that was certainly a period of time that I learnt from so much. I gain confidence from work. When I work harder than everybody else. Whether that would be in the gym, on the pitch. And that obsession has always been there from a young age. I never like to hear praise to be honest. Give it up for Jordan. I'm my own worst critic. I find it difficult to switch off from football, you know I'm constantly thinking about football all the time. I'm constantly thinking about how I can improve. When I was younger, when I'd go home from football I would still carry it. It would still affect us in me normal life. When Jurgen come in I feel as though he's changed a lot for me personally as a footballer, but also as a human being and helped us to understand and look at things differently. And that's been really big, you know not only in football but in my life. Jurgen gives him great responsibility. If you can play for someone who you feel they trust you then they're gonna give you a whole lot of confidence. Even if he's not fit to play Jordan Henderson now forms the backbone of that dressing room. Off the pitch as much as on the pitch. Let's go! It's the new big boy rivalry of the Premier League. Liverpool and Manchester City go head to head at Anfield. Held up by Trent Alexander-Arnold went down under the challenge of his England teammate. That breaks for Bernardo Silva. The challenge by Lovren, they're appealing for handball. It's Aguero who is screaming at the referee. Pep Guardiola is up as well Liverpool are going clear at the other end of the field. If I have to describe our organisation I would say, organised chaos. It's really unpredictable what we are doing. It's going to come to Fabinho with the strike! Oh! Yes! - Wow! Fabulous! Absolutely stunning goal by the Brazilian. What a hit! Kevin de Bruyne with the delivery... Sterling's header! You don't have to be fitter to play for Liverpool. You just have to be fit and you have to fit our game. And our idea is actually not as intense as it might look. We do the things we do actually to save energy. So winning the ball back immediately is a two, three yard sprint. If you don't win the ball there, ten players have to run like 50 60 yards to win the ball back, it's much more exhausting. Alexander-Arnold with a glorious cross field ball for Andrew Robertson and Mohamed Salah's there again! Oh, that's beautiful! That's Liverpool all over! What a start for Liverpool! Two nil against Manchester City already. When Jurgen come in Jurgen brought that certain way of playing. It's a lot more intense. Need to be doing specific things in certain positions. That style suited me personally. You know, in terms of my game. High energy, counter-pressing, the high press. I want us to be really focussed on the things we can have influence on. I cannot motivate people by wishing that other team lose. For me, motivation doesn't work like this. I want to win, but I don't want the other team to lose to be 100% honest. It's just a logical result. Henderson pulls away from Gundogan Bravo doesn't get there! And Liverpool score again! Sadio Mane on hand to turn home Jordan Henderson's cross. Three, and it could be out for Manchester City today. People say offences win games. Defence win championships. I think one without the other cannot work. If you're only defensively good you will not win a championship. But if you are both, then you have a good chance. Premier League wins don't come any bigger than this. It is an almighty Liverpool victory. Liverpool's win over their biggest rivals sends them nine points clear at the top of the league. The dream of winning their first Premier League title is getting closer. It is bitterly cold overnight. And again it feels colder in the wind, there's a hard frost. There were a lot of challenges for us in this period. There's a Club World Cup. In Europe, nobody's really interested. Wow, another two games in the middle of the season. Ian Ladyman in The Mail, Sam writes Mo Salah and Sadio Mane should be lining up against Aston Villa this week. Liverpool could have sent the kids to the desert for a Club World Cup tournament that nobody cares about! Then in the same moment we had the League Cup game against Aston Villa. So people just told us, "If you stay at home and play that, respect the domestic competition. I think, OK. I never played this tournament. I had no idea about the tournament. How important it this how or whatever. Ali told me, when he was a kid their biggest game ever was when his club played in this final. For them, it meant everything. So we will go for it. Jurgen, do you think there is enough respect for this competition in England? Look, we are here now and we are completely focussed on it. If you would ask me before hand if I think that there should be a Club World Cup in the middle of our season I would say no. That's my honest opinion. But we are here to represent Liverpool and Europe. That's all what we do. Mo Salah! Mo Salah! The Mo mania, it is incredible. Mo Salah, Mo Salah... He's a really big person to look up to for millions and millions and millions of people around the world not just Muslims but especially you know, in Muslim countries. And, yeah, I hope he can put on a good show for them tomorrow and the Mo mania can continue. I think... Mo wants me to say something good about him. But if you play good, I'll say good things. What? - If you play good I'll say good things. You know what? To the... Step it up - you! - Salah! Mo Salah, Mo Salah... Flamengo waits in the final. Will it be a Liverpool or will it be Monterrey who face them? Salah. Works it through- Naby Keita 1-0 Liverpool. Salah. Alexander-Arnold, and touched in for the winner! Roberto Firmino for Liverpool! In stoppage time! Huh? Life and love. Flamengo against Liverpool in the final of the 2019 FIFA Club World Cup. Firmino, it's Roberto Firmino! Henderson. Looking for Mane. It's Sadio Mane, he's got Rafina for company. Mane with a lovely ball infield! Roberto Firmino! For Liverpool! The referee looks at his watch and Liverpool are the 2019 FIFA Club World Cup winners! Imagine we wouldn't have respected this tournament which means for the rest of the world in this moment pretty much everything. Coming back then playing on Boxing Day against Leicester the competitor in the moment, away. It's like a proper banana skin. Headed down, absolutely brilliant! Roberto Firmino back from the Middle East with goals and scoring again in the Premier League. We've just become Club World Cup champion and played the best game of the season, pretty much. Unbelievable. It was a pure football power demonstration of my boys. And there's the ball is this three? Oh, it is! Oh, my word! I can't put into words how good that was! Never before in the history of football a team had a bigger lead and lost the lead. So why should we think about something like that? Mane to Salah and back to him. Firmino! They're just beauty, like this... I get very early up every morning. I actually start thinking immediately about all of the possible challenges over the days. Mo Salah. It's for me difficult to describe things I do as work. Work are other things for me. If I only have to bring out the bin at home that's work. I like preparing training sessions. I like analysing football games. I cannot describe it as work. So if nobody would pay me for that I would love to do it anyway. So, thank God they pay me, not too bad on top. Maybe that's the description of a workaholic. I don't know. My wife would say 100%. I'm pretty sure. The reds of United unable to halt the march... ...that will surely lead... to Liverpool winning a nineteenth title. Mysterious... Pneumonia outbreak... In China... Coronavirus. It's West Ham who will get us underway with their captain Mark Noble. And it's towards Ogbonna and it could be turned in as well. Oh, it might come for Alexander-Arnold. It will, and in by Sadio Mane! Liverpool from behind. Liverpool are twelve points away from the promised land from the ultimate glory in English football. They could do it in draws with the games remaining in the season. They'd like to do it in wins and they'd like to start with a victory at Watford. Changes tonight for Liverpool come in midfield. Jordan Henderson is ruled out through injury. Injuries are so hard to deal with. I don't mind playing through pain. As long as I'm out there, I'm fine. The tough part for me is when you're actually on the side-line because I can't affect and help the team. It was a big blow massive, because the energy he brings in the game the feistiness at times. That's something that we definitely miss. Doucoure stole in and Sarr! Goal! And a shadow of a doubt is cast over Liverpool's cloak of invincibility. We didn't play well. We had the ball so, like for so many percentage but we couldn't create. Nicely done by Hughes. And Sarr is away. And this is a big moment! It's two for Watford. It's two for Ismaila Sarr. I don't think it was pressure. Some things didn't go our way and obviously it's pretty easy then to, you know, find excuses. Deeney... - ...that's it now" It's a hugely significant result for Watford but for Liverpool that long, long run is about to come to an end. I feel so much more responsible for defeats than for victories because if we lose a game I think my message was not clear enough. What we did in training wasn't clear enough. The boys didn't get it 100%. It doesn't mean they are dumb. That means I have to be more clear. And so Liverpool won't go unbeaten all the way in the Premier League. We had not enough chances. We didn't create enough. And that's what you... what leads them to a defeat. That's how football is and has nothing to do with the games you won before had nothing to do with the games you will win. It's just this one football game and for tonight, we have to admit that Watford was the better team. In the next moment, pretty much I realised, wow. But we have we have completely different problems. It's a complete, well, the world changed already. Two patients from the same family in England have tested positive for Coronavirus. In breaking news tonight New Zealand has its first confirmed case of Coronavirus. I remember we played against Bournemouth. Twenty-five points now ahead. A big gap, really a big gap. City played the next day and they lost against United. Manchester United. In the Manchester rain are going to do the double over city! I remember lying on the couch at home and for us it was really, phew. So I woke up Monday morning and heard about Madrid closing schools and universities. We had an incredibly important Champion's League game against Atletico Madrid. I thought, OK, Madrid closing... but there'll be five, six thousand people from Madrid tomorrow, to the game. That makes absolutely no sense. But I had to go to a press conference and in this press conference, a journalist asked me... We come from Spain. There's a lot of concerns about they have closed schools for 15 days. Aren't you afraid that you your players can get, you know, exposed? The ques- are you from Madrid? Are you from Madrid? I'm from Argentina. I live in Madrid. Are you concerned in your city they close... I'm not playing football tomorrow. That's exactly the thing I don't like. That you sit here and ask me this question. But fly from Madrid to here. So stay there, they close schools and universities. But by... and you are obviously concerned. That's the question. But because that's the moment that I really get angry. When you give me the feeling I have a problem which you don't have. We have all the same problem. I'm not-- - It was exactly. You said, "But I don't play football". That's only one, that's only one part of the-- You talk everyday to people from close range. What I don't do. Why are you here? Ask me this question. Stay at home. So then, I have nothing to do. I didn't organise this game. I'm just part of it. So, and of course it was not a normal Champion's League game for us. It was very difficult that night to prepare a football game and to ask the player to do absolutely everything to win it without knowing what will happen the day after. So we played this game, played a really good game but lost it, went out of the competition. I was, I remember I was really angry about the way Athletic Madrid played. But five minutes later, after all my interviews I thought, "What an idiot are you? You worry about losing a football game but the world is in a most difficult place ever". So I drove home, next day, training, coming in it was already clear the league will be stopped and now we have to organise the lockdown. Much of the football events in Europe have been put on hold, that includes the Premier League and the Champions League as well. So strange to be in the house not knowing what was going to happen. When we were going to go back to work. When is that, how bad is the virus? You know, is it... Who does it affect? Loads of different things. The whole club had to do an incredible job to keep these high-profile boys in a safe place. The only thing you can do outside is going food shopping. But that's really difficult for a professional very famous football player. 12107, 30076. Total number of deaths stands at 40597. Hi guys. I have accepted the challenge from WHO. The safe hands challenge. So try to follow the steps to clean my hands properly. I learn a lot of new things. I'm now in charge of dishwashing which is nice, actually, I enjoy it. I can, I am master of that little machine now and I did my first scrambled eggs. The challenge for next week is I'm 52 now and I cannot tie a tie. After this week, I should be able to tie a tie. We have a very big WhatsApp group in the team we're sharing everything so we always keep in touch every day. Look at him. You look great! I felt in that moment we just showed the togetherness. You know, how close we are as a group. Someone was feeling a bit down or whatever. Pick the phone up or on Zoom calls doing sessions together. Morning everyone. Morning! Naby you look so nice with the bald head! We should start singing, huh? Sadio's birthday. It's your birthday? Yes, Gini. Come on, a quick one. I'm only in for the singing. You have to be very professional. You have to make sure that you are doing the right things and staying fit. Shall we see who's going to finish last? Come on, Trent. Come on, Trent, we are all watching! Shock. T is knackered! I couldn't get the ball on me neck! Just scrawn and bone. No muscle that's why. You know, at one point you just accept it and wait for the for the right moment to kick on again. I miss everybody. I just miss everybody. Good evening, plans to ease parts of the lockdown have been put on hold after an increase in COVID infections. Christian, are you confident that the Premier League season will go ahead? None of us know. We'll see. We have no idea. Let's hope so. A lot of speculation about how the Premier League is going to finish. This is what Rio Ferdinand had to say on Instagram "I just think the Premier League should be void". Should we actually still be pretending that everything is normal and football should be carrying on? Obviously, there's still the ongoing discussion about how are they going to sort out the season. From Liverpool supporters' points of view they can all but give us the trophy. They've not mathematically won it. So you cannot give them it. The best thing you can do is give them a certificate. Better luck next year. Obviously, when you're in lockdown you see all these messages anyway. So there was a period if I'm honest where I'm like, "Pfff, can't be true". The Dutch Eredivisie look like they might be about to cancel their season now. The French league has been null and voided. People probably won't understand because you're talking about life and death here. But... you still give everything your whole life. It wasn't just this year. You know, I give everything, my whole life to try and win a Premier League. So to get to the point where I felt we were very close for then that to stop and not really know what's going to come after that was pretty tough. This is ITV news at ten. It feels like a long time since the last Premier League football match but at last the date has been agreed by clubs to restart the season. Football is back. It will be obviously for some reasons completely different. It's very rare that you go so long without seeing the lads and training together so it's been positive to be back with the boys. As you can imagine, we lose a bit of a rhythm and stuff like that in a time like this so it's like re-picking up that rhythm and picking up where we left off and keep winning. There were times when we didn't know exactly if we will play again in this season. Rumours about null and void and now we stand here and in a couple of days, the league will start again. And for this, we need you. We always needed you. All the things are only really special because of you. I can promise you we will feel your support. I will make the boys feel your support. We are still with you and you'll never walk alone. The world has changed a lot in the last three months. Players in their starting positions all dropped down onto one knee. Alexander-Arnold's take-- Oh, the header was down by Joel Matip. The touches for Firmino. The shot is just dragged. Liverpool remain two wins away from ending that 30-year wait. It's ended honours even. Liverpool move a point closer towards the Premier League title. The fans have been inside here and tried to dress the stadium as best they can with the flags that they would normally see here. He does go for the top corner and finds it! That's nice for Salah who runs in behind and this time makes sure. Here's Fabinho! Oh, how about that? Slick from Liverpool. Special from Liverpool, Mane for Liverpool. Absolutely brilliant from Liverpool. If it would be like in my dreams the stadium would now still be packed. My family would sit there. I would go in with them, I would see them and the whole thing would be much more emotional. But inside me, I feel exactly like that. All around the world Liverpool supporters will be watching Chelsea against Manchester City. Unless City win here tonight the title will finally be in Liverpool's hands. Pulisic, he's through here. Can he finish this Christian Pulisic? You bet he can! For Liverpool, the day has finally come. I haven't let him celebrate at all even though we were 20 odd points clear he was never allowed to celebrate. You can't say until Jordan Henderson's actually lifted the trophy. This is the first time we've been up here since... Grandad's funeral. My Grandfather passed away a month ago. He was an avid Liverpool supporter he travelled all over the world. "You'll Never Walk Alone" was played at his funeral. He went to 1977 European Cup. 1978, '81, '84 and he went to Hillsborough. We put a rose on the Shankly statue. He used to say football is more important than life, you know. But it's not. My father, he died, unfortunately nearly 20 years ago. Now, when I look in a mirror, I really get shocked. I look exactly like my father. I would today... I would have a brilliant relationship with him. Because I'm now old enough strong enough to say what I want to say in the right tonality. So now I could we could really have completely cool conversations and about all the things what happened. But unfortunately, we definitely can't do. But I'm Christian, so I believe in God. I believe in heaven. I believe in, erm, yeah. That he's just there. Annoying other people and telling them you have to watch this game pretty much together with me. And I'm 100% sure about that. If he would have seen how my life turned after I started as a manager I think, yeah, he would have been pretty happy. Well, it's the night where Liverpool's championship heroes finally get to let their hair down but not before the serious business of one of the Premier League great rivalries wraps up the Anfield season. Chelsea arrive on Merseyside knowing a win will book their place in the top four. Well, it wasn't how it was meant to be. This was supposed to be the night where the Liverpool fans celebrated the heroes ending that long wait for the title. They're at home supporting from there. But Liverpool certainly got other things to look forward to in their night tonight and that's obviously the presentation but first and foremost I think it's about putting a performance on and getting a result in this game. There's a very important football game and I expect a good game from us and unfortunately, a good game from Chelsea as well. And in the end, we will see what happens. Let's make it as difficult for Chelsea and let's make it possible for us. That's the plan. And Keita has come away with a ball. Goal! Nice. - Whoa! That's really good from Mane. The challenge was by Kovacic. Writing the scripts himself! Gini Wijnaldum! Slots it home. Lovely flick. Oh, what a save... It might still go in. Giroud was on hand to tuck the ball home. It's 3-1. Alexander-Arnold, Firmino! Pulisic again. Beautiful. And in for Tammy Abraham. It's Pulisic, took his time. Picks out the top corner. It's Oxlade-Chamberlain. He's going to replace a disappointed Mohamed Salah. Mane, look at Robertson absolutely flying. And the ball comes all the way through. Glorious. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain! Well, we're Premier League Champions we can finally say. For me personally, I've waited all my life. It's one of the best nights of my life. The King of the Kop Kenny Dalglish brings the Premier League trophy to the Kop. One could finally die in peace having seen them lift the trophy. Jurgen Klopp has brought it home by leading this Liverpool's side to the greatest of glories. For me, I was just felt very, very proud and honoured to be asked to present the trophy. Here comes the captain the leader of the club. Jordan Henderson steps forward. I wish I could have taken the mask off and you could have seen the pleasure in my face. It felt extra special for Kenny to bring me personally to this football club. For him to then hand me the Premier League trophy was an incredible moment. You know, something that dreams are made of. A team of record breakers now Liverpool are back where they belong. Champions again, Liverpool! Absolutely incredible. It's an incredible moment. Obviously, my coaches are really in a good mood. I like that. So, yeah. No, all perfect. Absolutely perfect night. Let me say it again: without crowd it's not the same. But, you know, we only do it for you. We know it. And we will have a time we will do it together. Congratulations to all of us. We are Champions of England, Europe and the world because of you, by the way. Winning trophies is pretty much the holy grail for everybody involved in sports. We won the league, but now we go for the next one. Wow. We have to show that we are ready to fight for each yard and for each result out there and that's what I expect. Yeah, not bad, not bad. No, I'm fine with the title and I don't need another one. That's great. The problem is it's exactly that. There was a long, long storm. Rainy days and all that stuff. Big, great people tried it and we were blessed to be the ones to finally get it. When you have tough times you stand with people and you'll get through it. The song means community. It has the same meaning whether it's 50, 60 thousand whether it's an empty stadium. And at this time, it's more apparent than it's ever been. Everyone needs to come together. It takes a world to come together to make a change. You never walk alone is exactly that. We all need to walk together to make the world a better place. It's an incredible song. It's a very special anthem and it's our anthem.
