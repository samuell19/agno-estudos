(calm music) - What are you doing now? - Examining caterpillars' footprints. Very interesting. - Come on. Oh, morning, Pitmore. Why aren't you at piano practice? You've got to be good for the school concert. - Can't this morning, Mike. My uncle says I've got to help him (mumbles). - You know what Miss Lanyard said. "Keep with the heavenly music!" Enemy aircraft, 12:00 high. (gunfire) (upbeat music) (shattering) - Why don't you give us a tune? (gunfire) - Here, I know this bloke. I'm sure I've seen him somewhere. - You couldn't have. - There might be a reward if we found him. - Don't be daft. How are we likely to find him? - You never know. (fast-paced music) - Good morning, sir. - Hey, that's him! - Who? - That man! The one in the picture wanted for robbery. - He didn't look anything like him. - Bet it's him. He looks suspicious. I'm gonna shadow him. (ominous music) - Hey, why don't we call the police? - Yeah, you call the cops, I'll stay on his tail. - I recognized him from a poster I saw at the police station. - The identical picture? - Yes, wanted for robbery. - Where are they now? - They're just turning out of Stowe Road into Gullfork Road. - [Policeman] Stowe Road into Gullfork Road. - Oh, and listen. They'll be easy for you to spot because my friend's carrying a violin. - Is he playing it in the street? - No, he's carrying it. In a black violin case. - Alright, then we'll send someone over. - Good. And be as quick as you can, please. - [Policeman] You just sit tight. - Okay, thanks. (sirens) - Right, where's the man you're following? - I'm not following him. My friend is. - But the boy who phoned us said his friend was carrying a violin. - Yes, I know. We both are. - You'd better get in the car. - I warn you, my lad, this is some kind of a joke, you'll be for the high jump. - It's no joke, Inspector, honestly. There he is! - That was quick. - Yeah, wasn't it? Great, eh? - He's in here, sir. - Come along, Constable. - I said we'd catch him, didn't I? - Is this the man? - That's him. - I see. Allow me to introduce you. Detective Sergeant Jones of this division. - A policeman? Well, he does look like him. You look at the photo. - Suppose I could run you in for obstructing the police. - I'm sorry, sir. It was a mistake. - And you made it. But I'll tell you what, you stick to playing the violin, we'll stick to policing, hm? Come along, Constable. - Why don't you give us a tune? - You and your detection. - Where are we going? - You're not going anywhere. You're staying with the car. - Where are you going then? - I got some business to attend to. I shouldn't be parked here in the first place. If you see a copper, give a toot on the horn, alright? - Why don't you stop at a parking meter? - Don't ask so many questions. If you see a copper, give a long blast on the horn. Alright? - Alright. - Look, there's Pitmore again. That's funny, he's pretending he hasn't seen us. - Old Pitmore's always a bit weird. - I know, Banquo's ghost I call him. - Whose what? - Banquo's ghost. You know, from Macbeth at school. Hello, Pitmore. Didn't know you had a car. - It's me uncle's. He's just got it. - We're going to go to Gertie Lanyard's for our music lesson. Would you like to come say hello? - Never shake thy gory locks at me. - Don't mind him, he's got Macbeth on the brain. - Avaunt, and quit my sight. Let the earth hide thee. Thy bones are marrowless, thy blood is cold. Come on, Mike, we'll be late. - See you at school on Monday. Come on, Bill. - Funny about Pitmore. - What? - I don't know, the way he's carrying on. Pretending not to see us and sort of lurking in that car. - What do you mean, lurking? He wasn't lurking, he was just sitting. How can he lurk in a car? - Well, I think it's jolly suspicious. - You think everything's suspicious. You've got a suspicious mind. Liftoff, we have liftoff. (humming) - What's happened? - I don't know. - Here, let me. Flippin' thing. Let me out. I ain't no ordinary doggone cow wrassler, I swear it. - I wish there was someone out there. - All the other floors are offices and there'll be no one in them today. There's only Gertie. We could try calling for her. - Miss Lanyard! - Miss Lanyard! Gertie! (playing piano and singing chords) - [Bill And Mike] Miss Lanyard! Gertie! Miss Lanyard! (honks) - Whose car's this? - It's me uncle's. He won't be long. - Well, tell him he's not supposed to park here. - I'll tell him. - And don't play with the horn, sonny. - Sorry. (woman screams) (gunshot) - Did you hear that? - What about it? - It was a gun. - A gun? Here, on a Saturday morning? - I tell you, it was a gun. A revolver. Gangsters, probably. - Crooks and gangsters, that's all you think about. - Listen. - Now what? - He's coming up the stairs. - Who is? - The gunman. - Oh, come on, man. Hey, Mister-- - Shh! (crashes) Something funny going on. - I expect he was just in a hurry. - In a hurry to bash down the door and jump on the roof. (humming) - Hey, we're moving. - William and Michael. - Miss Lanyard! - I was just going out. - But we were just coming for our music lesson. - A lesson? Well, dear me, I can't have been going out then, can I? Perhaps I was just going in. - No, Miss Lanyard, you weren't doing that. - Somebody knocked. Did you boys knock? - We couldn't knock. We were stuck in the lift. - Oh, why didn't you call me? - We did. - Come on, boys, we mustn't waste time, must we? Only one more lesson before the concert and we'll give it our best. Come now, Michael, stop daydreaming. Just look at you. (mumbles) (humming) - [Bill And Mike] Dink dink diddly doink ding doink doink. - I like to see enthusiasm, real enthusiasm! Come along, boys, tune your instruments. Must be well in tune! (playing violins) (knocking) - It's someone at your front door. I'll go. - What are you doing here? I'm sorry to disturb you, madam. We're police officers. - Nonsense, young man. Policemen wear little blue helmets. - We're in plainclothes, madam. Detective Inspector Mainwaring. This is Detective Sergeant Jones. There's been a robbery in the jeweler's shop downstairs. - A robbery? - One of the gang may have escaped this way. - We saw him. Or at least we saw his feet. - Oh dear, oh dear. Paganini strikes again. I've had enough of your help for one day. - Paganini, the brilliant! Do you think he was in communion with the devil? - I really couldn't say, madam. Now what do you say you saw? - He was running away and he broke open the door to the roof. - We heard him. We were stuck in the lift. - You would be. - We had our heads just above the floor, you see, and we saw these boots go rushing by. - To the roof? Where is it? - I'll show you. - Boys, boys, your lesson! - Back in a minute, Miss Lanyard! - Go steady. - Yeah, don't want any more bodies around here. - Bodies? - Someone was shot. - Is he? - On his way to hospital. Hey. Don't touch anything. - Sorry, sir. - Come on, get out of it. - Here's something. - Whoever he was, he's used to heights. - Come on, we're moving. - What about the car? - I've finished with it. It was only foreign anyway, come on. - Now keep quiet about this. We think he's one of a gang. Half a dozen jewelers in central London in the last two weeks. We want the whole gang. - About the shoes, you know, the ones we saw from the lift. We can describe them exactly. They're thick rubber soles, with yellowish uppers, and heavy stitching. And golden laces. - Thanks very much. You suggest I should go around arresting everyone with shoes like that? I should have to start with myself, I've got a pair like that. I can say to my certain knowledge as the chief superintendent. - William, Michael! - They're coming, madam. Give us a tune, eh? (ominous music) - Dinner ready yet? - In a minute. - About time. - Where'd you go, love? - The High Street. Mum, about Uncle Fred. Does he have to live with us? - I know he's not an easy one, but he is my brother. When he came back from South Africa with nowhere to go. - South Africa. If he'd been in South Africa, he'd have more of a suntan. - Perhaps he had an indoor job. Goodness, this is heavy. What's in it? - I don't know. Let's have a look. - Oh, you shouldn't. - I know, but there's something funny. - It's locked. - Just as well it is locked, with you poking and prying. - What's in it that's so secret then? - Who do you think you are? - Don't hit him, Fred! - Well, tell him to keep his fingers out of my property then! (bangs) (playing piano) Stop that row! (bangs on keys) I said pack it in! You play this piano once more when I'm in the house, I'll have it chopped up for firewood, alright? - [Pitmore's Mom] Dinner, Freddy! - Come on. What's this? - Beef casserole. It's alright, isn't it? - Beef casserole? Is that all you can cook? Beef casserole again? Oh, it's not alright. I'm not eating this muck. (crying) - Now look what you've done. Why can't you get out and leave us alone? - I'm getting out! I'm gonna have me dinner at a pub. And when I finish this little bit of business, I'm gonna get out this rotten house and out this country for good. - Funny business, I bet. - You watch it, son. You're mixed up in this more than what you think. - Hi, Pitmore. - Hi. - See any excitement on Saturday? - What excitement? - The robbery! At the jeweler shop under Miss Lanyard's flat. - I don't know anything about any robbery. - But you must have seen it, you were there. - Yeah, it was fantastic. So we were stuck in the lift and we saw the robber escaping. At least, we saw his shoes. We'd recognize them anywhere. - Shut up, Mike. - [Mike] Eh? - I said shut up. The police told us not to talk about it. - But you were just down the street in your uncle's car. - I told you, I didn't see anything. - But you must've. I mean, you were there. - I told you, I don't know anything about any robbery. I don't know anything about it at all. - He didn't have to go on like that. You only asked. - Hey, what's the idea of shutting me up? No harm in telling Pitmore about the shoes. - You can't be too careful. There's something odd about Pitmore. - Well, that's nothing new. There always has been. - Suppose so. Got any ideas? - What about? - Tracking down the man in the shoes. - How can we track him down? We've got to leave that for the Inspector. - Him? We had the only genuine clue and he wouldn't even listen. And all he could say was "Give us a tune." - Perhaps he found some other clues in the shop. - I'll bet he didn't find anything half as good as ours. We actually saw one of the crooks. - We only saw his feet, just his shoes. That inspector said there must be thousands. - Look, the shoes. Quick, he's getting on. - This isn't our bus. - Who cares? Come on. Gonna sit here and watch him come down, right? - Alright. - Quick, he's got off! - Wait for it. Not while she's moving. I'm not having you break your neck on my bus, thank you. Alright, now you can go. - St. Luke's. - Perhaps he's robbing the church! Let's have a look round the back. (fast-paced music) - Ah, musicians, I see. (groans) - Come on. - Feet, feet, feet. I'm sick of watching feet. I said I'm sick of watching feet. Let's pack it in. Can't you say anything? - I'm thinking. - That makes a change. What about? - The police. The way they made fun of us. "Give us a tune." They're not listening to our clue. - Well, it wasn't very much of a clue, you must admit. I mean, it's not getting us very far, is it? - Stop grumbling and watch the feet. - He probably isn't even wearing 'em. - Of course he's wearing them. Unless he's got wooden feet that's all unscrewed. - Oh look, I'm fed up with you and your feeble jokes. Perhaps they're his robbing shoes. Perhaps he wears different ones every day of the week. - Look! It's him, come on. - Right-o, Ted, let's go. - That's clinched it. The yellow shoe gang. - Thanks for minding the barrel, Charlie. - Hey, now buy your boots here! Genuine pigskin! Only half the price they are in the shops! - They're too big for you, son. - Quiet now. Silence! Right, open your Shakespeares. Macbeth, Act Four, Scene One. Rogers. May we have your kind attention please? - Yes sir. - You can be Second Witch, Rogers. Hendry? - Yes sir? - Third Witch. And for the First Witch... (students shouting) Silence! This isn't a bear garden. Pitmore. Pitmore? - Yes sir. - [Teacher] You can be the First Witch, Pitmore. - Yes sir. Thrice the brinded cat hath mewed. (meows) (laughs) - Hold it, sir. We haven't got a cauldron, have we, sir? Can't do it without a cauldron, can we, sir? The witches are supposed to be prancing around a cauldron, pulling faces and carrying on. - Yes, yes, Rogers. Get on with it. - Come on, Pitmore. And you, Mike. - Yeah, come on, Pitmore. (students shouting) - Come on. - You'd better take the stage, by popular demand. (clapping) Get on, boy. - Thrice the brinded cat hath mewed. - Thrice, and once the hedge-pig whined. - Harpier cries, "'Tis time, 'tis time." - Round about the cauldron go. In the poisoned entrails throw. Toad, that under cold stone - Sir, we're not doing it. - Not doing what, Rogers? - Round about the cauldron going. I mean, sir, there's no point if we don't do it properly. Is there, sir? - Very well. Go round the cauldron, Pitmore. - Round about the cauldron go. In the poisoned entrails throw. Toad, that under cold stone-- - Pitmore? - Days and nights has thirty-one Sweltered venom sleeping got, Boil thou first i' th' charmèd pot. - [Mike, Bill, And Pitmore] Double, double toil and trouble, Fire burn, and cauldron bubble. - Mike. It's the feet. - What? - The feet. Yellow shoes. - What's the matter with you, Rogers? Get on with the play. - Yes, why can't you shut up and get on with the play? - Boys, stop that right now! (shouting) Take your places at once, all three of you. I think we've had quite enough of the three witches for the moment. - Those were the shoes alright. And it fits with what Inspector Mainwaring said. Someone used to heights. Window cleaner's used to heights, right? - Right. But there are thousands of shoes like that. - And thousands of window cleaners. But it's the first time we've seen a window cleaner wearing the shoes. - I've forgotten me key. - Are your parents in? - No, but Nicola might be. She's my sister. - What's she like? - Ghastly. - Nigel, darling! - Nigel? - Oh, it's you. Who's this? - Bill, friend of mine. That is Nicola. If you're serious about the window cleaner, we ought to tell the inspector. - You know what he'd say. "Give us a tune." - Yeah. - Not fair! You're leaning on my eyelashes. Where's the other one? - Well, if you must leave bits of yourself everywhere. - Looks like a dead spider. - They're utterly ruined. Oh, I'm going out with Nigel this evening. - We'll have to trace that window cleaner ourselves. - I suppose we could find out who he is from the school. - Yes. If your father could draft a note saying (mumbles) we'd like a window cleaner, the school keeper will tell him. - Whatever it is you're talking about, you don't suppose Daddy would get mixed up in your ridiculous games, do you? - I don't think he would do it, Bill. - Here, wait a minute. - Oh, now look what you've done. - Sorry. We'll type a note. - That'd be forgery. - Oh, no, it wouldn't. I'll sign it M. Hendry. Not my fault I've got the same initials as my father. - Careful! Look. - Sorry. (phone rings) - Hello? Nigel, Nigel? - [Bill And Mike] Darling. - Oh, shut up. Not you, my popsy wopsy. Hang on, I can't talk here. The children are listening. - What should I put? Dear Mr. Howard? - No, better make it formal. Dear sir. - Listen, do you think we could go to the car (mumbles)? There's this marvelous film about this girl. Maureen says she's like me, sort of a cool blonde, refined and sexy. - Our window cleaner has caught bronchitis and the windows are getting filthy, so please could you give us the name of the firm who cleans the school windows because... - Hang on. I can't remember all that. How do you spell bronchitis? - Just say he's broken his leg. L-E-G. - See you soon then, my sweet. Bye! Love you too. - Makes you cringe, doesn't it? - Is this yours? - Oh no! No lipstick, no eyelashes, my hands are covered in nail varnish, and Nigel's coming 'round in 10 minutes! Whatever can I do? - [Mike] Go out with Bill instead. - Oh, you're horrible. - What's the matter with your sister? - Oh, she's always like that. - Mr. Howard. - Not now, boys. - But I've got a note from my father. - Well, leave it on my desk. - It's urgent, sir. - Urgent, well, what's happened now? - Our window cleaner's had an accident. - Your window cleaner had an accident? This some sort of a joke? Pick them up. Both of you! Give me the note. - My mum says that if we can't find a new window cleaner soon, my dad'll have to clean them. - Well, what's wrong with you cleaning them? - They're too high. Oh, and you see, my dad wants the name of the school window cleaner. - Alright. I don't believe a word of it, but I haven't got time to argue! Here you are then. - Sorry about the books, sir. - Alright. - Thanks a lot, sir. - Oh, I've heard that before. - Be careful with the books, sir. - Mind you don't drop them again, sir. - Thanks very much for the card, sir. Rudge Office Cleaning Services. Overbury Road, Fulham. We could bike it easy. - I haven't got a bike. - You can borrow my dad's. - [Mr. Howard] Hendry! - Sir? - You might mention to your father, there are two Cs in accident! - Yes sir. Two Cs in accident. - Mum? (ominous music) - Hey. Are you spying on me? You want a look? Come and have a look. (clatters) Nice bit of gear, eh? - The jeweler shop! And the man who was shot. - Now don't tell me you didn't know. - And the car. - Was nicked for the getaway. We had to split up. We'd have been caught if it hadn't been for you. - Me? - Yeah, sounding the horn when that copper come past. Warned us just in time. - But I didn't know. - You didn't know we was turning over a jeweler shop? What you think we was doing, parking on a yellow line? Tell that to the judge. - What do you mean? - I mean you're what they call an accessory. You helped, you're one of us. So if you're thinking of telling the coppers about this little lot, you'd better forget it. If I go down, you go down too. - What did you want to come back for? Why couldn't you stop in South Africa? - South Africa. Oh, yeah. - You were never there, were you? Where was it really? Parkhurst? - It was Dartmoor, as a matter of fact. And I'm not having any piano playing school kid sending me back there again neither. I'll tell you what, if you help me get rid of this little lot, that'll be the last you see of me. Alright? Come on, I'll show you something out the front. Now, take a (mumbles) out there. You see that geezer in the car? See him? He's a policeman. There's been one out there every day since it happened. - So they're onto you. - Well, they're just waiting for me to make a move. That's where you come into it, my son. - Me? - You and your mother, you wanna see the back of me, right? - You know we do. - Alright, well, as soon as I've finished this job, as soon as I got rid of that stuff in there, I'll clear out. - You promise? - I cross me heart and hope to die. Now here, this is what I want you to do. - Is your name Jimmy? - Sometimes, why? - Me uncle sent this. - Go on, on your way. * Sweet Adeline * Will you be mine? (laughs) A couple of high tinnery musicians, I see. You know, it took me right back when I saw them fiddles. Why don't you play us a tune? - Oh no, not again! - We'd like to know the name of the window cleaners that clean our school windows. - We're trying to find one them. - Names? I know nothing. They don't tell me nothing. All I do is look after the yard. They don't come in except on Fridays. They work shifts and they're paid. All inquiries have to be left till Friday. - So you don't know their names then? - You're as bad as the other blokes what come here asking questions. All I do is look after the yard. All inquiries-- - What other blokes? - Coppers, (mumbles)? - F. Raddings. - That's him. Fred Raddings, late of HM Prison Dartmoor. Got a record of robbery with violence as long as your arm. - You knew? - Been under observation all week. - Then why haven't you... - Arrested him? We want the whole gang. - And you're waiting for them to get together for the share out, so that you can catch the whole lot. Is that it? - That is just about it. What made you decide to come along and tell me all this anyway? - I didn't want to. - [Inspector] I can imagine. - Mike persuaded me. He said now we knew who it was, what could we do? We couldn't very well arrest him ourselves. - Good thinking. - How did you know it was Fred Raddings? You didn't see the feet. - Took a little bit of time to discover the windows at all these addresses were cleaned by the same firm. One Raddings worked for. - So we did help. If it hadn't been for us telling you he'd gone that way. - And very grateful we are. Why don't you get along and leave the rest to us? We'll keep an eye on him. - Thank you, sir. - Right, sir. (drumming) - I'm sorry it's all over, in a way. - What? - Our detective job. - I'm not. - This all frizzled out. Wonder where Pitmore fits into it. - Quiet, children, quiet! Quiet, boys. Now unfortunately our soloist is not here yet. He's probably been delayed. But we shall wait no longer. We must all rehearse thoroughly in order to give it our best for the concert tonight. And as I'm sure that none of you want to spend more time indoors on Saturday than you must, until Pitmore arrives, I shall take the piano part. (ominous music) (playing music) (ominous music) (playing music) (ominous music) (playing music) (ominous music) - Well done, Michael. Well done, William. You showed real enthusiasm. - Thank you, Miss Lanyard. What do you think about old Pitmore? - I'm worried about him, boys. Such a gifted musician but delicate, I fear. Perhaps not entirely happy at home? You two are friends of his, aren't you? - Well, sort of. Nobody knows him very well. - It would be kind if you could call at his house, make sure that all is well. Such a tragedy if he were to miss tonight's concert. It means so much to him. - Okay, Miss Lanyard. - Thank you, boys. - Where are you going? - To ring the bell. - No one uses the front door. We're supposed to be mates of his. - Alright. - Mum? - Yes, love? - There's a couple of blokes from school coming to the door. I can't see them. - What shall I say? - Anything. Say I've gone out. - What's going on? You've been acting ever so strange lately. - Nothing, Mum, I just can't see them. - You're not mixed up in anything with your Uncle Fred, are you? I wouldn't want that to happen. - Then it's a pity you ever let him come here in the first place. (knocking) - Yes, what is it? - We were looking for Pitmore. - [Pitmore's Mom] He's not in. - [Mike] Oh, he wasn't at rehearsal. We just wondered-- - I don't know where he is. - He will be at the concert tonight, won't he? - I couldn't say. He hasn't mentioned it. - He hasn't? - No. Now I'm very busy, so off you go. - That's really weird. He hasn't mentioned the concert? It's the most important thing in his life. - Hey, look. F. Raddings. - Oh crikey. - You let him give you the slip. We keep tabs on him for a week and you let him give you the slip. Now I suppose you think he'll be waiting for us at home with a nice cup of tea. No, he's probably making the share out. - Maybe, sir. But what puzzles me, he didn't have the stuff on him. He wasn't carrying anything. - Getting someone else to do his dirty work, probably. - Look, there's Pitmore. - He must have been in all the time. - Let's follow him. - There are those kids again. - That doesn't mean anything. - It might. They're always cropping up in this case. Stop the car. I'll go and talk to Raddings' sister, you keep an eye on those lads. And don't let them give you the slip. (ominous music) - We'll be okay here. We can see in the mirror when he's getting off. - I don't like it. - What don't you like? - Following Pitmore. Seems sneaky. - We're not doing any harm, only following him. It's not as if we've brought the police along with us, is it? (fast-paced music) Here, he's got off. - What? (dramatic music) (grunts) - Yes, mate? - Don't use that term with me, Constable. I ought to see your head at CID. - Oh, yes, mate, I mean, Sarge. - Look! Come on. - Well, where is it? - How do I know? I'm just as worried as you are. - Yeah, you'll be lucky to get another job after this. Dragging me out of bed for what? Hang on, hang on. You made it then. Well, where's the swag? - I couldn't bring it. - Couldn't bring it? What do you mean, you couldn't bring it? Got the container all ready. Boat organized, (mumbles) arranged. - Have you finished? I've had the cops on my back all week. - That's all we need. - Oh, leave it. Look. - [Man In Hat] What's he doing here? - He's bringing the gear. - He looks as if he's lost his way to school. Here, we don't want kids in on this, do we? - Oh, shut up. Where's Eric? - He's over there, minding the rest of the stuff. Come on. - Come on, Tarzan. - Pitmore's with him! Quick, they're coming this way. (laughs) - Best way to get this stuff out of the country, Eric's mate on the other side smuggles it out the docks and onto the black market in the common market. (laughs) (hammering) - Right, in she goes. (ominous music) - Now we'll put Harry's homemade seal on there. It won't open it till it gets to Amsterdam on Monday. (laughs) - That's torn it. - Amsterdam on Monday? That's two whole days! - Right, all we need now is a crane. Well, don't stand about looking as if you've just seen a ghost. - But-- - Get off home! Kids. - It's Raddings' nephew. Right? Right. Stay where you are now, sonny. - I'll be damned. - 999 call, sir. Raddings' gang are going to Sutton's Wharf. (sirens) (fast-paced music) - Come on. Come on. - It's no good. No one can hear us. I wish there was something we could make a real noise with. - Here, look! Musical instruments. - Alright, Raddings. What container are they in? - Find it yourself. (cacophony of instruments playing) - That could only be Paganini and his chum. (accordion playing) Well, that wasn't bad for a warm up. Well, my lad. Next thing is to put you into a police car and rush you across London in time for the school concert, along with your two mates Paganini and Stradivarius. - But aren't I-- - No. By the word of your mother, we know Raddings forced you into it. Well, off you go. Give them a good tune. (playing music) (audience applauds)
