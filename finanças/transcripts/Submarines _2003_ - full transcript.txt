Engineering, checkauxiliary and related gear. Run diagnostic to confirm achieving 5,000 pound status-- over. Aye, sir. Engineering reporting, commencing diagnostic in six minutes-- over. Very good. Engineering-- 5,000 poundstatus achieved-- over. Very good. Thank you-- over. Bye, sir. Captain on deck-- Captain, sonarcontact-- the American sub is still on direct heading towards us, sir. Contact is imminent starboard side. Captain, what are your orders? Captain! Dmitry, verify depth and .. Ready ahead. Captain, contact in 20 seconds! 15 seconds! , Captain. - Contact! - From where? For you, Koba-- Russian paperclip mines. There's business cards. They were too good to pass up at the price. That's what worries me. Open it. It's just I can still feelthat old thorn in my side. What? I'm fucking cold. Come on. Show some sack, buddy. Anything? Negative. Either we lost him, or thebatteries are finally dead. Nah, he's in there. I vote we lost him, OK? Koba's gonna know we tampered with the mines. He's gonna know we're out here. Koba always knows. $250,000 US for the whole lot? Da. How drunk were the fucking Russians? Remote-- stand back. OK, merry Christmas Cap-- we have ourselves a testarming on the 10th floor. Good work, Zhukov. I guess the Russians need .. There could be 100 guys in there. There's the dead Russian. Dead Russian's got less than 100 rounds-- not great. What do you say? Well I'm in. Get up. Then let's kill this sonof a bitch and go home. Have the men check in again. Three four-- check in. Check in! Where the hell is he? Come on. Cap, they're gone. Check your six! Pull the fuck out, now! Stand back, god damn-- Yes! One for the bad guys. Watch your step. Only half the mines are lit. Thompson, find us a way out. CO Harrison, life's resilient cockroach-- Too many mines-- can't get a lock. Tracker's overloaded-- too many mines. Koba, I will bring this whole fucking building down around us. Back your men off! And I'm the one portrayedas a lunatic on CNN? Go ahead. Bring it down. The exit's right behind you. Oh yeah-- Cap, follow me! I'll clear the way. Finish it, Zhukov. Come on! Make it look good. Cheap ass gun-- Zhukov-- cut him, Zhukov! Cut him good. Give me some good body blows. Zhukov, see if you canget a shot of hi kneeling at some point. Bring him back in the light, damn it! Get him! Kill him, Zhukov! Kill him! Yes! Zhukov, take him! Good! Get him now-- now! Bring it, queer bait. Come on. Get up, Zhukov! What's wrong with you? Cap, this is clear. Whoops, almost forgot those. Thompson! Oh, this is good stuff. You look fantastic. The mines were too cheap. I shouldn't have brought them to you. Not at all-- we got rid of that cocksucker. Here, send this out immediately. We can make Wolf Blitzer by next week. This is JohnStanley for "National News." It's another bad year for the US Navy. The maiden voyage of the USS Manta, America's newest nuclear submarine, has ended in embarrassment. Like the Green Bill beforeit, the Manta's collision with a Russian submarine on joint maneuvers has brought its Captain, William Arlington, under fire. The Manta will return tothe San Diego Naval Shipyard for repairs later this week. The damage lies below the water line, and that's just where theNavy wants to keep it. Captain Arlington will face acourt martial upon his return. That's why they put the JAG officer on the ship. Because, with an accident likethat, I mean what do you-- sir. Yeah, the meltdown's coming. Put a lid on that, shithead. Arlington doesn't melt down. Captain Crunch? Captain Crunch-- now that's pretty funny. Now where'd you hear that? Oh, it's coming from JAGOfficer Heather Mitchell. She started it. Pretty damn funnycoming from a JAG officer, but coming from you it's a death sentence. Oh come on, man. Look, you listen. And you listen good. You respect the Captain, andyou wash that talk no matter how many subs the old man hits. Come on. Captain Crunch-- Sir-- Captain on deck! You do your homework, Sims? Sorry, the wicked witch has been on me all day. But Deere still says that he made positive contact with the Russian sub before you even gave the order. The Russians are still really pissed. They haven't given us shit-- anything to work with, sir. But you know my vote. The gear is faulty. You're my great white hope, Sims. Well it's a good thing I'm white then huh, sir? I'm honored. Carry on. Captain, we were just talking about you. I have no doubt about that. Sims has been veryuseful with the sonar logs. You got a good man there. Yeah, I know that. Is that really what the two ofyou have been talking about, how helpful Sims has been? Yeah, yeah. And take care of that fallkit while you're at it. OK, Sims is stuffing so manystolen documents under his seat he's grown a foot. He wants to help you, fine. But I just feel like he's wasting the boat's time right now. So now he can't assist me. One piece-- I ask that you just getthis boat home in one piece before the enemy or the media take it apart. And I'll help you out of the hole you're in. You got to hide your shovel first. The new one-- Captain Crunch-- it's good. The crew says you came up with it. I think Captain Crunch is pretty damn funny, but it's not mine. It's bad enough you've taken my command. At least leave me my reputation. Home in one piece-- I can do that quietly. Or I can do it publicly in front of the crew. But it'll get done, Captain. Thanks-- thanks for allthe help on that one, Greg. Well I am trying, Bill. You know, we're all on thin ice here. No, I'm the one who's on thin ice. What you're on is a fence. It's different. You know, the comment didn't come from her. It came from some kid in Forward Torpedo-- Shithead Talbot. She chewed him out for it. Looks like your grapevine isfaultier than your new sonar. Quiet-- hey, you shouldn't besmoking that at your station. It's not my station. Seal or Marine? I walk upright. I must be a Seal-- John Harrison. Heather Mitchell-- where'sthe crewman that's supposed to be at the station? Ah, he always takes offright after they check on him. That's why I come here. It's the quietest spot on the boat. Why don't you report him? Because I get to smoke. Well, it looks like I'm taking your spot. Hm, it's not mine. It's familiar, that's all. I worked Tomahawks for two years-- as you said, quiet. I'm sick of busting people today. See any action? What? On Tomahawk duty-- Oh, two years of drills-- but I've heard every big dick joke in the world. Know any good ones? Since you're here, let'stalk about the accident. Did you detect any shifts inthe boat's direction beforehand? I wasn't here. I'm just hitching a ride back. I don't know exactly what happened. This boat looks worse than me. What was your assignment? Bite me. Looks like you're JAG. You ought to know you can't ask me that. Ah yeah, JAG Officer Mitchell-- are you gonna crucify Arlington or what? I'm not here to crucify him. And I thought you didn't doanything about the accident. It was an expensive fender bender. My rifle's all banged up to shit. I don't give a rat's ass. Nobody got hurt. He's a good captain. Why don't you leave him the fuck alone? Just an opinion, Lieutenant. Tomahawk boy will be back in a minute. Should I be fishing here, Yuri? Am I the captain of a trawler, huh? One more minute, sir. We need to draw freshair into the entire boat. Am I on the wrong ship? Put out that damn cigarette! Just one more thing, and we'll be ready. What now? There is no report from the lookout, sir. Sonar-- You blind bastard! What do you see? Peace and quiet. Masks now-- put them on! Do as I say. Gas! Gas! All clear. Excellent work, comrade-- well worth the money. - Thank you, General. The Navy should have paid us this month. But no matter-- I'm now the richest man on the boat. Yes, you were. Stop, stop! You call those low velocity bullets? Kill half the crew. The Russian crew? Yes, before they wake. Keep only the ones we need. Record everything. And as for the third tanker-- time for six more months of high oil prices. Thanks. He still thinks we'rerigged for silent running. I hear he sleeps in the mini sub. Oh yeah? Yeah. And I hear he has good hearing. And he got a real knife, too. So be quiet and chew your food. So Dick, I hear the Proteustorpedoes are up and running. They're up. For how long? I don't know. Do anything work on this boat? It's the Navy's flagship. The flag works just fine. Engines are great. I swear engineeringTukachevsky here is praying for a vapor leak. Not on my boat. Pray for something else. This reactor's like a child proof safety cap. I swear the Navy doesn't trust me inside it. It's a reactor, dumb-ass. You shouldn't got inside of it. - Can I talk to you, sir?- Three tankers? Yes sir. Excuse me-- flash graphictransmission from NAV-CON. Just call me when you're ready, Captain. As you were. Anybody needs me, I'll be in the mini sub-- sleeping. Terrorism strikes home again, this time on the high seas. The Alaskan gulf is in flames this afternoon after the latest of three tankers explodes and sinks inAmerica's busiest oil route. The Navy is searching for asub, possibly of Russian origin. The Russians are denying any involvement, instead pointing toward BinLaden's Al Qaeda organization. They are pinging the shitout of the Alaskan bottom. They haven't found a thing. What its designation? The Inferno-- they're sending over a file now. Koba-- isn't he the onethat worked with Hezbollah? I never heard of him. We should be in on this. With that hole in our side? Besides, they're 500 miles south. They'll have him before we could get there. I'm sitting on a bench again. Proteus stealth torpedo-- a million dollar one shotweapon with a five mile underwater range and its own personal sonar-- fuck, by. Might as well be the sub's mascot-- Toledo? Yes sir. Christ, they got a bridge on this boat the size of a casino's first floor. We're working in a rubber. Yes sir. Rule number one-- don't fuck with the tube. Don't. That's what the auto-loader's for. Rule number two-- keep the torpedoes working, which ain't easy with theauto-load always fucking up. Yes sir. And speaking of rules, gentlemen, it seems that there is a new nickname floating around the boat. I just hate nicknames. And you know how I feel about the captain. So if I find anyone tarnishingthat fine man's reputation, I'll load you in the tube myself. Chief-- how long? - 20 minutes. - 20 minutes? 20 minutes. Did you check the gear? Captain, you got a minute? What do you got, Sims? Equipment problem-- sonar'strying to lock up on something, moving fast, boat fast and deep. But the signal's like a ghost. The sonar's arguing with itself. I think the computer's finally fritzed, sir. See, it thinks it's tracking an Akula. But, well, it's thin, sir, like an echo. I can't really tell with all the noise, and it's coming from the side of our boat-- not without submerging. The wicked witch will blow a hatch if we dive. Might be worth it, though, ifwe find out the gear's faulty. But she'll never let us do it. Do what? Submerge-- a sonar test. Sonar test? I'm coming off that fence, Bill.- Yeah, it's about time you-- Yeah, I'm on the other side. Do not do this. You know we're supposedto remain topside until we dry dock. This is important. Important? My son is four months old, and we've been at sea for six, Captain. I mean all I've held in myarms is a fucking video tape. And I am not sinking my career on this boat. I will not back you on this. It's nice to see you're developing a spine. Mr. Lee, submerge the boat. Let's taker her down to 300. Aye-aye, sir. Flames down five degrees. Flames down, five degrees-- Your poor eye. With the money, we'll buy you a new one. Or maybe I'll just give you mine. Hey, it's good to be on the sub again. Even in that uniform? Especially in this uniform-- serves the Russian Navy rightfor putting me in prison. I was a good officer. Your old captain didn't think so. Then he should have been more careful. With the damn camera, we'll never be able to show our faces again. Fine with me. Please Zhukov, I'llfollow you anywhere as long as I know where we are going. I don't ask questions. Do you know where he is taking us? Yes. Yes, Koba's the one man who is worth my word. I'm sorry. It'll be fine. I am not Osama bin Ladenor Carlos the Jackal. I am not Saddam. I am Koba. I am the man who does allthe real work for them. And what I have in store foryou will make all those efforts pale by comparison. I make this record so you willknow it was Koba that beat you. General-- A service contact far behind us-- something strange. Not strange at all-- it's diving. It's a sub. Why wasn't I informed? No, sir, these signatures are wrong-- more like a freighter, too much weight for a sub. If it's a freighter, it's sinking at 20 knots. We thought it was a surface ship. Clearing up-- it's fading again, sir. This doesn't make any sense. I thought it was a-- I made a mistake. What do you want me to do? Can it hear us? Doubtful with the stealth,, but it's open pretty wide for speed. Slow the boat. Better the. Slow the boat. Better the. See if he follows us. Bring us right 20 degrees. Come in, Sitar. Right 20 degrees-- 20 degrees. It's gone-- a ghost. The gear's crap, sir. It has to be. The noise from our side'sstill clogging up the works. Let's make sure, shall we? All stop. Aye-aye, sir-- all stop. Contact is slowing. Should we turn to attack? We have more important things than engaging this contact, whatever it is. Are his tubes open? Yes, I think. Turbulence-- I think his tubes are open. Are you sure? Yes, his tubes are open. Bring us around. Come in, Sitar-- right 20 degrees. 20 degrees-- affirmative. Find a targeting solution. Solution-- affirmative. Gone, sir-- I never thought I'd be sohappy to find a problem. See, XL? It's not so bad. Underwater? Are we underwater, Captain? We are chasing a ghost, Lieutenant. The sonar is officially fritzed. I thought I just haddinner with a reasonable man. You've left the surface without consulting me. You had express orders not to do that. I showed you courtesy back there, Captain. I shouldn't have. I'm taking this boat beforeyou hit anything else. We have a solution. Fire tubes one and two. Fire! Not one more scratch-- I hereby relieve-- Caught on sonar, two contactsin the water-- torpedoes bearing 271 degrees, sir. From where? Out of nowhere, sir. Nowhere? Sims, you casing more phantoms? Countermeasures, now. Mr. Lee, take us to 243degrees, down 20 on the planes. Aye-aye, sir-- planes down five degrees. Planes down 5 degrees-- General quarters, general quarters-- this is not a drill. Repeat-- this is not a drill. 500 meters-- 300 meters Call out! Alito, sir! Talbot, sir! Damage report-- We just lost the top of the counting tower. All surface communications are dead. My god-- Davis! Torpedo! Get the! Toledo! Yes, sir! Now fill that leak! Com, this is Torpedo! Com, this is Torpedo! Shit! Com's dead. Flooding between here and forward torpedo. The crew is closing off the damaged areas, sir. Can we fire? On what? And we just lost contact withthe port side torpedo room. Destroyed? Don't know-- the crew'strying to reach them now, sir. We're losing the bogey fast. Push the reactor to 105 %. Sir, we cannot reach them in this condition. Then we need to slow him down. We need to shoot back. Get him off my bridge. It's not your bridge. We need help reaching port side torpedoes. Come with me. Is it dead? Is it dead? It's crippled badly and not returning fire. Range-- We are at the edge oftheir torpedo range, sir. They know we're here now. Turn us around. Resume on course to finalobjective and increase speed. We've lost critical time. The is shot. We need to wire a patch. It's not moving. That's Morse code. I know. I'm a Seal. Somebody's on the ball. Morse code-- we're under attack! Oh yeah, I kicked it's ass. Oh, fuck! Toledo, how's that torpedo! Ready to go, sir! Orders to fire? I don't know yet. Caught on sonar-- I've got the phantom again.He's pulling away fast. Engine room status? Fine, sir. I can give you full power. Pushing what, Captain? The sub's a barn door with all that damage. Go to 100 %. Aye, sir. Give me a hand here. Right away. Yes, sir. The water's rising! What do we do? Our job-- we're dumping this thing in the water. I'm raising the loader. Get us a torpedo. You need to get atorpedo in the water now. Captain needs it now! It's almost there. It's jammed. Get it off him! Get it off him! We're losing him. Engine room, what else can you give me? Another 5 %, or I could get out and push it faster, sir. We need that thing the tube! Lift it! 1, 2, 3-- one more time! 1, 2-- We're out of their torpedo range, sir. Prepare to come about 183 degrees. I got it. Big dick-- yeah, your nickname-- Big Dick Owens. That's enough of that, seaman. Strong enough to laughis strong enough to work. You just gonna lie there, boy? No, sir. Then let's do this. 1, 2, 3-- Torpedo room con, what's your status? Come on, you lazy assholes. Your life's on the line! Arlington needs this pieceof shit in the water now! One up, ready to fire! One up, ready to fire, sir. Ready to fire, Captain. Fire. Goodbye, assholes. Contact in the water-- torpedo. Torpedo! At this range? Let it burn out. General, it sounds different. Evasive countermeasures now! Direct hit, sir! Tell Owens to get another one ready. Good work, Sailor. I got a new nickname for you-- The Terminator. How's it holding. Fine, sir-- running hot, but fine. Good girl. Captain, target's hit and slowing, but it isn't destroyed. I think it's got moresurprises than just stealth. Yeah, it is holding, but it rang us like a drum. There has been some shock damage to the-- Bridge, this is the engine room-- some damage to reactor. We've got to slow the boat. Negative. We will explode, Koba. Make revolutions for 20 knots-- no slowing. Zhukov, it's time. Use the specials. Yes, sir. Caught on sonar, two contacts in the water, rear firing torpedoes. Maneuvering is dead. We cannot evade them. Blow the tanks. Put us on the bottom. - We'll implode. - You got a better idea? Sink the boat. We're clear. Let's get number two ready. Yes, sir! Oh! We just lost the front end. Owens and his crew. Still sinking fast, sir. Departmentsare not responding, sir. They're gone. Just get the hell out. Passing 700-- the pumps are quitting. Three minutes till wefold, two with the damage. We need 10 % more than we've got. Lieutenant Mitchell, isthat Seal still with you? Here, sir. We're sinking fast. We're on the losing end of the curve. How much lift can thatmini sub of yours give us? We'll sure as hell find out. Passing 900-- 1,000-- 1,200-- come on, come on. Float, fucker. 1,500-- It's really close. It's trying to level out. Mr. Lee, ready on the forward planes. Forward planes ready. 1,600-- Now Mr. Lee, planes up 20 degrees. It's leveling off. Engine room, full power! We're gonna make it. Yeah! Touchdown, baby-- yeah! I knew it! Yeah baby, yeah! Mind that panel. Mind that panel. Level her off at 300, Mr. Lee. - Aye-aye, sir. - Chief! Sir? Have that Seal meet me in my quarters. Aye, sir. We are still here. Are we? Take a look at their faces, Zhukov. See? They know we are wounded. Koba's paying us to deal with it. The dead can't spend money, darling. And I hope he's notselling this sub to get it. It's worth little now. He's not selling it. Then what? What is our final objective? Tell me, please. Where is Koba taking us? Into history. General, a word. It had better be good. It isn't. The Russian crew-- I know what mutiny looks like when it starts. Really? I've seen or harder faces on whores-- the pussies. We kicked their asses in Afghanistan, remember? It will get worse. They know we have wounded. What happened, Zhukov? You used to be a brave man. Let me remind you how we foughtfor other men's reputations. And all the wounds we've ever have healed over. Like we've never existed. And if we all die, whowill give us our credit then? This proof the world can'tdeny, proof that we beat them. Because the wound we inflictthis time will never heal. Are you afraid of death, Zhukov? It's that woman, isn't it? Isn't it? Clouding your judgment-- we are to be written into the book of Allah. Maybe I should find someoneelse to do your job. You'll get it back when I can trust you again. You wanted to see me? Yes, come in. Leave us. You just struck the lastloyal man on this boat, Koba. I just reminded Zhukov of his place. Need I remind you of yours? My place depends on where we are going. I think I can tell you now. Los Angeles Those are missile keys. Yes, default cruise missiles-- look here, too. All within range of less than an hour with cities full of peoplewho will be remembered. Zhukov will know about this. Zhukov-- you've come betweenZhukov and his loyalty for me. My place is with him. That's my problem. Yes. I need your help. Yes, sir. Dumb fucking Russian. Zhukov-- Yes. Into the missile room immediately. The Captain's got an idea to catch the Akula. This is what he wants. Holy shit. I guess you get what you pray for. How childproof is the childproof cap? How important is it? I mean, do you know whatthat will do to the boat? That's the idea. Look, I know, but it's dirty-- Russian dirty. Will that give us enoughpower to catch the Akula? XO, that'll give you enoughpower to travel back in time. Enter. Captain-- oh, you've got some sauce. Here, I'll find you a glass. So what's the latest? Well, we're maintaining speed with the bogey. What stealth she had cameoff when the torpedo hit. I'm lined up on her, but I've got no way to fire. Who is she? Well I've got my theories, ofcourse nothing to back them up. I think it's Inferno, the same sub that the entire Pacific fleetis searching for 1,000 miles north of here. So why am I here? The Manta is the last weapon that I have. Engineering can push the reactor to 120 %. That'll give us five minutes. If we don't catch that bogeyby then, our explosion will. My condolences on your men. Trust me, right now I know how you feel. Halo Joe-- he carried this huge RPK machine gun he called the Dead Russian. Dead Russian-- Yeah, that's who he took it off of. So who are we up against? OK, we both know the Manta hasone more smart weapon left. I've been sleeping in it. I can't ask you to do this. Captain, I may be wrong about the identity of the guy we're up against. Hell, I could be wrong about a lot of things. But can we take that chance? This bogey-- it's got stealth, rear firing torpedo tubes. It's not standard. And it's trying real hard toget close to the coastline of California. Missiles are on a cooler? That's an attack boat. An attack boat with a lot of surprises-- our only real chance is you. The alternative is the Manta and her crew. This decision has to be yours. Oh, I'll do it. Just one thing-- I need your sonar man's time rewiring the mini sub, something special and that's it. You got it. Look, I could still be wrong about this. You're not. She died afraid. She came to tell me about the mutiny. I wouldn't listen. And then he overheard us and drew his weapon. She tried to save me. She said it was what you would have done. Would I? What do you think, I did it? Zhukov, I'll prove it-- all on tape, right from there. I warn you, she did not die well. Here, look for yourself. Engineering reports reactoroutput now at 98 %, steam pressure holding it steady. Hey, back to your own station. The mutiny, it's started. Zhukov, get me within 500 miles of the coast. Kill them all. Kill them for her! Oh, fucking great. ,, An attemptedmutiny up here-- it's time. Kill the non-essentials among the crew. Join us up here. We can use the help. Yes, Koba. Remember that thing I said we'd never do? Yes? That thing we're not supposed to do? - Yeah. - We're doing it. Whoa. Chambers, can I have a minute? Not now, Lieutenant. I'm trying to restore topside communications. That's what you want, isn't it? What I want is for youto explain something to me. We both know the Manta is finished. I doubt we could make it backto port if we were towed. Yet Tukachevsky's taking thesafeties off the reactor. The Navy's a bitch, ain't it? Listen to me. I believe that Arlington's aboutto make the second greatest mistake of his career. And I think you're helping him do it. He is my captain, and I am the XO. That might not mean much to you, but it means something to me. Look, whatever that enemy sub is, we are in no condition to engage it. And Arlington has nothingto lose, but you do. What are you implying? You have a son, right? I have a son I've never seen. I'm sorry. That must be very hard for you. But tell me something, Chambers. How do you want to come hometo your son, as an officer or as an accessory in a court martial? You think I'm worried about a court martial? My wife and kid live in San Diego. And if the captain's right, andwe let the Inferno get away, they might not be there for me to return to. You don't even know that would be a target. I think you're just too afraidto stand up to Arlington. You're the XO of this boat, Chambers. You know you can stop him. The one thing I do know is, if I ever do get to see my son, fucking over my captain willmake a lousy bedtime story. You're making a big mistake, Chambers. The only mistake I made wasstopping and listening to you. We're all here, sir. OK, It's safe to say we'venever done this before. We've slowed for repairs, sowe're falling behind the Akula. We need to give the mini sub in our hull a boost. So stand the hell back, gentlemen. - Yes, sir. - We're on it, sir. You got it. Captain, we need to have a little chat. I don't have time for a little chat, Lieutenant. I've got a job to do. Let me guess. I've done something wrong. No, but you're about to. Pushing the reactor-- there's no way in hell I'm going to let you do that. Listen to me. That sub about there is Inferno, and its nuclear capable. So what if it is? Even Inferno can outrun a radio wave. If we get topside communications restored, we can report the positionof the enemy so that-- So that the Navy can send reinforcements. No, look around you Lieutenant. We're alone out here. It's just us and Inferno. We're the lone gunmen. We're it. But you still don't know it's him. I've been sniffing Akula'sasses my entire career. Most of the time, we justmonitor each other's movements. This one's on a serious clock. It's him. And what if you're wrong? We are here in this mess in the first place, because you made a mistake. No, a mistake was made. And something or somebodyon or off this boat is lying about it. The sonar's lying? That gear's better than the stealth on the sub we're chasing. The sonar's not at fault, never was. You're right. The sonar's not faulty. And I hate to admit it, butI did not make that mistake. I've seen the logs. We've all seen them. I know I hit that sub. I was there, Lieutenant. But it wasn't my mistake. It's not my fault. You were the only weak link in that chain. Weak link-- what about the Russians? They've hit their share of subs. What, they suddenly stopped lying now that the Cold War is over? So now it's the Russians fault. What about Flipper, Mr. Limpet? It sure as hell wasn't mine. If it was, if you're rightand it was my mistake, then I've dragged the crew intothis trying to prove it wasn't. And the bitch of it is I'll never know where that mistake was made. I'm truly sorry. But you still can't do this. Don't kill your crew on a hunch. I don't want to kill the crew. I'd go out there in a wetsuit with a harpoon gun if I thoughtit would do any good, but it won't. Leave the reactor alone. I can't. I'm sending Harrison out first. I need to push thereactor to get him there. Can we at least agree on that? One man is an acceptable risk. So you agree that the enemy sub might have nuclear capability. It's possible, enough to riskone man but not the whole crew. I need to kill that sub now. I only think it's worth oneman Agree to that at least. He keeps closing and closing, even with no way to fire. I should have hired him. The rest of the AmericanNavy is pissing in the wind. Dumb fucking Russians-- Slow down, kid. Yeah. Arlington has a lot of confidence in you. That is one thing that I'm sure of. Concentrate on that-- or not. Look, he really trusts you. There's something I never had. My commanding officers-- hell, my whole fucking life I've just been get benched for swearing. Never looked real good on paper. See, that's just it. I always have-- tests, simulations. I could always makemyself look good on paper. Can you keep a secret? Where I'm going, kid, your secret's safer with me than it is with yourself. Captain's innocent. That's the secret I'm taking to my grave? You'll find the problem with the sonar. I am the problem with the sonar, sir. Stupid-- that test with the Russians was my first taste of real fear. I felt like an air trafficcontroller at Heathrow. Yeah, under pressure-- All those subs and ships allswirling around in the water-- Yeah, the next thing you know-- And after that, the worseit got for the captain, the more scared I got. So I made it look good for myself on paper. That's definitely a secret for Valhalla. Two of those are missing. I've made mistakes. I've made mistakes. I can't go back, because thedead are blocking the way. What you were talkingabout, that's reputation-- yours, his. Look around you. You really think any of that matters now? Whatever happens, you let him know. A man like that should know. And you tell him yourself beforehe finds out some other way. And get the fuck back to work. Captain on deck. Engineering, status-- You'llhave what you asked for. Just one request-- Yes, Chief. If I don'tmake it, tell all the people I owe money to to fuck off. Will do, Chief. Topside communications? Still running patches on the inside-- doesn't look good. You're insane, Arlington. I didn't agree to this. Going to 120 % will be an underwater mushroom cloud in five minutes. That gives Harrison four minutes and change. Chambers, don't let him do this Captain, I cannot allow-- I did it, Greg. I hit that Russian sub. I know that now. I'm sorry I got you into this. You call down to Engineering, you get them to stop this-- But I know I'm right about this. XO, that's Inferno. And she's loaded with nukes. You still have no proof. Chambers-- Greg, I'm Captain Crunch. It's my ass for the damageto Manta's side, not yours. I'm right about this. No fences on asubmarine, right Captain? Besides, if any man in the Navycan hit the Inferno, it's you. BLS communications are restored, sir. I know I'm right. It's got rear firing torpedoes. Engineering, status-- Close, sir. Stealth propulsion-- Jesus, this we already know. Make me look good on paper. Captain Harrison, how are things up with you. I'm ready to kill this clown, sir. I'll see you on the other side. If I completely fuck this up-- And some sort of short range cruise missiles, nuclear tipped-- the bogey, it's got to be Inferno. Engineering, push the reactor 120 %. Aye, sir. I'm only praying for good things. The Inferno's missiles havea range of 400 to 500 miles. Navigation Con, how far off the coast are we? Make that to Los Angeles. 473 miles to Los Angeles, sir. Con, sonar-- Inferno is slowing, sir. We're at maximum sea speed, sir. Detach the mini sub. Engineering-- Yes, sir. Stand ready for ramming speed. Aye-aye, sir. That figures. Get out of my chair. Con sonar-- enemy's slowingto a dead stop, sir. We're closing the gap fast. All stop. I'm getting an aspectchange in the target, sir. Missile tubes, sir-- opening! Keep us lined up on him, Mr. Lee. Steady as she goes, sir. Now that was a lousy smoke. General, contact-- Torpedoes? Slower-- it's got a strange signature. It's-- Koba, hope you recognize a man's voice. This time there aren't anymines for me to step on. You cheap chicken fuckingson of a $2 whore. Evasive-- pull ahead! We can't, if you attempt to launch. Pull ahead, evasive now! Hey asshole, film this! Harrison-- Harrison's gone, sir. Con sonar-- enemy's riding himself, sir. I hear the missiles pressurizing. It wasn't enough. They can't kill me, fucking Americans. We are listing. We can't launch. Shut up! Right the sub. Right the sub! Whoever you are, thatwas your last big chance. That Seal joined his miserable team in hell and saved me the trouble of hunting him down. By the will of Allah, I hope you live to see this tape, to see it all. I'vegotten the core temperature down again, but I don't knowhow much longer I can hold out. Captain, what's the call? I'm sorry, Greg. I really wanted to meet your boy. So did I. Engine room-- ramming speed. Aye-aye, sir. Captain, I have something to tell you. Not now, Mr. Sims. Captain, I might not get another chance. You're an innocent man. Delay that order. Where are you, Lieutenant? He's preparing to launch. Captain, we don't need to sacrifice our lives in the process. We can still bring Manta home. I need you to bring us underneath Inferno now. Underneath? Manta still has a weapon, a Tomahawk missile.- It won't arm. We're underwater. We're not gonna get a secondchance at this, Lieutenant. I know this system. I can make it work. You have to trust me. Please trust me, Captain. You know I'm right. Ma'am-- I need you to ready your weapon for launch. It's a Tomahawk, ma'am. We're underwater. Yeah, Captain already mentioned that. Now listen to me very carefully. I'm going into that tube to rig the warhead to detonate on impact. Then we'll seal the door and fire the weapon. But-- Shut door, fire weapon. Engine room, delay that order.Stand ready. Aye, sir. Bow planes down 20 degrees. Bow planes down 20 degrees. Take us directly underneath her. Aye-aye, sir. This they'll all remember. I'll last longer than the radiation. Bypass cut red-- oh god, short. Are you all right now, General? I'm 40 seconds away fromimmortality and killing southern California. I couldn't be happier. I've got it! Yes! Oh god-- General quarters, general quarters-- this is not a drill. General quarters-- We're in position, Captain. Engineering reports are standing by. Seal the door! It'll flood. You can't stay in there. Seal it now! Just do it! You tell Arlington to getthis fucking boat home! Reportsmissile hatch is open. Captain, one of theTomahawk doors is opening. Keep us lined up. Aye-aye, sir. I hope you're right, Lieutenant. Finally, Zhukov-- we win, Zhukov. We win. Zhukov, let me tell you again about paradise. Zhukov-- Zhukov, what the hell is that? The end. Direct hit, sir! Engine room, get us the hell out of here! OK, gentlemen, give methe red line and then some. Yes, sir! Zhukov-- The missiles are knockedsideways in the tubes. Oh no! They must not see us like this-- not see us like this! No! On no! They won't. They won't see anything, Koba. No one will ever even know you were here. We're clear. Engine room, dead stop! Let's retire. Great job, Lieutenant. What's your status? We're clear. What's your status? Lieutenant Mitchell-- She didn't make it, sir. The Americannuclear submarine USS Manta returned to the San Diego Naval shipyards today under a cloud of secrecy. The fate of its Captain, William Arlington, is still up in the air. The Navy has bigger problems to deal with in the wake of the tankerdisasters in the Gulf of Alaska last week. The pumps are quitting. HEATHER MITCHELL: Topside communications-- Three minutes till we fall. I'm stillrunning patches on the inside. Doanything work on this boat? Fear is always baggage. You can make a friend of pain. Fear always screws you. It seems I've hadsome luck hitting Russian subs. Things aren't always what they seem. I'm truly sorry. But you still can't do this. Don't kill your crew on a hunch. I'll help you out of the hole you're in. Sims, I hardly recognized you. You look forty. Sir? You're getting gray. If I'm-- No-- you can have my ear anytime. Harrison wanted me to, uh-- he wanted me to tell yousomething before he died. That's bullshit, sir. I have to tell you something. Will you walk with me? Always.
