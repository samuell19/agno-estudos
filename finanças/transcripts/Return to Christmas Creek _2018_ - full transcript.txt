(cheerful holiday music) ♪♪ It's Christmas again ♪ And everybody's home ♪♪♪ ♪ The fire's burning bright Outside the lights are glowing ♪ ♪♪♪ ♪ We all gather 'round to celebrate and cheer ♪ ♪ Let's raise up our glass ♪ To another year ♪ - Okay, so flights and hotel? - Booked. And car pick-up, too. Thank you, Carrie, you're amazing. T-minus 24 hours until I'm sipping cold Mai Tais on the warm beach. I still can't believe you do Turks et Caicos - for Christmas, Amelia. - It's my tradition. Trust me, once you try it, you'll never go back to regular Christmas festivities. Like sipping eggnog by the fire? Exactly. I'll buy you a ticket! No, come on, you've been too generous this year. Besides, I thought you invited Brad? I did, but Brad's set on spending Christmas - at his parents'. - I guess some people like the simple joys of a traditional Christmas. What is more joyful than sunshine? Anyway... I invited him to Christmas dinner with my parents tonight. You're having a Danish smorgasbord and it's December 18th... It's not really the same thing. So, you nervous for the big pitch? Carrie, we designed their top selling app. Bill Burns needs us, we've got this. Correction: you designed their top selling app. - You've got this. - Well, either way, it's almost time to start shopping on Christmas Assist! For 3 years, our partnership on Closet Assist has offered the individual shopper an unparalleled selection in an over-saturated marketplace. Now, I'm about to revolutionize the way we do our holiday shopping in an app. For those who want to escape the chaos of Christmas, and get away from it all without all the fuss, I give you Christmas Assist. More advanced than a gift registry, our app consolidates your loved one's shopping wish lists into one place. All you have to do is click on their online profile like so, and you can browse, buy it, and deliver it all in the click of a button. Interesting idea. What's even more interesting, Bill, is that we've built in an algorithm that, based on past purchases, not only buys the gift, but also sends the card. Amelia, aren't you concerned it takes some of the thoughtfulness out of gift-giving? It also sort of ruins the element of surprise, don't you think? Oh! Well... I mean, you could look at it that way, but there is so much pressure on what to buy these days. This way, you can rest easy knowing you found exactly what your loved one wants, without ever having to be there in person. Now, you know we're big supporters of Closet Assist, Amelia, and we were excited to see how this app could benefit our clientele, but I'm not sure that Christmas Assist encompasses the true spirit of Christmas. It's a no. I'm sorry. (sad melody) What do they mean I don't know Christmas? I was born in a town called Christmas Creek... you can't get - more Christmassy than that! - I thought you were - from San Francisco? - I am. I mean... I moved to San Francisco when I was 13. So, okay, technically, I haven't been back to Christmas Creek in a while, - but I know Christmas. - Yeah, of course! You're very... festive. Hmm. - They're right. - Amelia... Don't let the investors get you down. They just didn't get it. But it's my job to make them get it. - I was certain it would be a yes. - Because you're great at what you do. If anybody knows apps and what people want, it's you. (sighs) Any word from Brad on what time he's coming to dinner? Yes. He apologizes, but he's going to be late, but your parents will see you right at 6. Right. Okay. Well, then I better get cooking. Carrie? Thank you for everything. Oh... and Merry Christmas! Oh! Now, there's the spirit! (chuckles) (upbeat holiday music) It's only 4 flights of stairs. It's good for the cardio, Dan. - My cardio is perfectly fine. - Until you find work here, it's important for your stress level. I'll tell you what'll help my stress: not talking about it. - Hello, sweetie. Looks delicious. - Hi, dinner's almost ready. Hi, honey. Do you want some help with the frikadellers? I am preparing the smorgasbord this year. You are my guest. - You do enough for us. Please. - It's okay. Let me help you. Do you think the reason I can't cook is because the Danes eat open faced sandwiches for every meal? - (laughing) - I think the reason you don't cook, not that you can't, is because your focus is on your work. - Is Brad coming? - Later, he's stuck - at the office. - Oh well... More cheese for me. Dan, why don't you set the table? - (chuckles) - What's this? - Doesn't matter. - We received a letter from Hughes' Family Inn this morning... What? From Uncle Harry? How'd he find you in Chicago? It was forwarded from our San Francisco address. It was originally mailed back in November. - Are you going to open it? - Ah, it's probably junk mail. (jazz music in the background) - How did your meeting go? - Uh, it was fine. Great. Actually, not great at all. The investors think - I don't understand Christmas. - What's to understand? I'm sorry, honey. I know how hard you worked on that app. Yeah, I just don't get it. I'm hoping that Turks and Caicos will reinspire me because right now, I don't know how to fix it. I'm sure you'll think of something. You know, you could stay here this year. Your dad's got some interviews but-- What, and we could do another smorgasbord? Mom, you just moved, and we don't ever do a big Christmas with just the 3 of us anyway, so don't worry. Just focus on getting settled. ♪♪♪ Are you gonna open it, Dad, or just keep staring at it? I am not opening that, or the past. Maybe Uncle Harry is reaching out? Well, he never has before, so don't get your hopes up, honey. It's probably just a general mail-out. You won't know unless you open it, right? - Mm-hmm! - Here. OK, I'll do it. (whimsical melody) "Experience the magic of the 40th Anniversary of Fly By Santa by staying at Hughes' Family Inn." Just a general mail-out. Well. I guess not much has changed. - Hello, hello! - Brad, you made it. Sorry I'm late. Work was crazy. It's okay. Things were crazy here, too. I haven't even started packing yet. My parents stuck around for as many rounds of Smorg as they could, but you missed them. - Can I make you a sandwich? - I'm okay. Thanks... Truth is, I've been thinking. - I think we should talk. - About Christmas. My parents really want to meet you. And I would like to meet them, too. So, why don't you want to spend the holidays with us? It's not that... It's such a sweet offer, Brad, but I'm already booked for Turks and Caicos. - You can go there any time. - I understand that, but you know the holidays are stressful for me. One argument between your dad and uncle years ago shouldn't ruin all family Christmases. I just like the peace and quiet of the beach. I can't just lay on a beach while my family is together for the holidays. My parents are getting older... I want to spend more time with them. - Then I don't know what to say. - You just designed an entire app around the holidays, and yet - you want nothing to do with it? - Brad, just... Please, don't bring my app into this right now. I just don't do festive family stuff. I thought you were okay with that. Not if my girlfriend never wants to celebrate with me. Amelia, I'm really trying here, but... But what? (soft music) For 2 years, it's been this push-pull dance we do. I try to move things forward, and you keep pulling away. And I don't want to dance anymore. I'm sorry, Amelia. (sad melody) ♪♪♪ (sigh) Oh...! (hopeful holiday music) Your flight leaves in an hour; what are you still doing here? I'm not going. What? Why? Because Brad broke up with me last night. Amelia... - I'm so sorry. - It's okay... but suddenly the idea of sipping Mai Tais on the beach by myself - no longer sounds fun. - So, what're you gonna do? I'm going back to my roots. I knew you were a brunette! I once cut off all my hair after a breakup. No, I'm... I'm going to Christmas Creek. - Wait, what is this? - Fly By Santa. It's a tradition my Uncle Harry started 40 years ago, collecting toys for needy children in remote areas and delivering them by plane on Christmas Eve. This is me. (chuckles) That's you? You're so cute! I was Santa's Little Helper. I was his co-pilot when we flew. Of course you were. But, wait... I thought you haven't been to Christmas Creek since you were a kid? I know, but it's only a 3-hour drive from Chicago. So, if Bill Burns thinks I've forgotten the spirit of Christmas, maybe Christmas Creek will help. Alright, I like this idea! Thank you! (hopeful melody) Why are there no street signs?! (sigh) (whimsical music) (long sigh) - (nervous laugh) - Need a hand, ma'am? No, I'm good, thanks! Are you sure? Because you've been driving about 20 miles - under the speed limit. - Yeah... I saw the plates. Illinois, huh? You're from out of town? Yeah, I was trying to read my GPS, but there are no street signs, so... That's so you can ask a local for directions. - Oh... - Where you headed? I'm looking for Hughes' Family Inn. I thought it was this way. You're nearly there. Just about half a mile down the road, - then take a right. - Oh! But, you know, you shouldn't be driving these roads without winter tires. I know, I clearly didn't plan well. - I wasn't supposed to be here... - Well, don't sound too excited. - (laughing) - Why don't you follow me? - Then you get some proper tires. - What are you, the road police? Actually, I do search and rescue for the area, and I'd hate to have to pull you out of the ditch. Right! OK. Well, I appreciate that. - Follow me, I'll get you there. - Thank you! Alright, no problem. ♪♪♪ ♪♪♪ Hey. What are you doing here? I was driving around when I found - this woman looking for the inn. - Uh. You haven't changed one bit. Oh. Thanks? - You got a reservation? - Uh no, not exactly... Uh... I'm sorry to tell you this, but we're all booked up. You might be able to find a room in town. Uncle Harry, it's me. Amelia? - (laughing): Yeah! - Wait, you're Meels?! Wow! This is... this is a real surprise. I'll say! (chuckles) Hum... (stammering) You remember Mike Ruggles? - Wait, you're Mike Ruggles? - As far as I know. So, did you drive in from San Francisco? Uh, no, I moved to Chicago a few years ago for work to launch a shopping app called Closet Assist. Maybe you've heard of it? (smacks lips) Or not... Anyways, I got the brochure for Fly By Santa and I figured why not come back for the 40th Anniversary flight? Oh. Are your mom and dad coming too? Uh no, it's just me. It's great! (laughing) You have grown, let me tell you! - It's great to see you. - You, too, Uncle Harry. You know, I should get going. Okay. See ya! Welcome back to Christmas Creek, Meels. - Enjoy your stay. - Thanks, Ruggles. See you! See ya. Well, come on, let's get you inside. - OK, yeah! - Good to see ya! - Good to see you too! - Did you see the plane? Oh, my gosh! It's still there? Wow, it looks amazing in here, Uncle Harry! - Did you do all this? - Yeah. - I fixed it up a little bit. - But it looks so... so beautiful... and it's so busy! Well, we've been really lucky. Lots of returning guests. Harry's being modest, it's all him. He's the heart and soul of the inn. Thanks. This is Nathan, he runs our front desk. - This is my niece-- - Amelia. Nice to meet you. Niece? You have a niece? - Welcome to Hughes' Family Inn! - Thank you. Um, I was hoping that you might have a room available? Okay! Uh, room... Uh, this time of year... - Um... - You know what, don't worry. - I'm sorry, I should have called. - It's fine, really. It's fine. It's not a problem at all. You know what? - You can stay in the cabin. - The cabin? Where I grew up? - And where I now live. - Right. Of course you do. We still have your old room. I mean, if you're comfortable. Yeah, that would be great. - Thank you! - Then perfect! Problem solved. OK. Alright. Let's go get your bag. Great! ♪♪♪ (grunting) (happy sigh) (gasps) It looks exactly the same! Yeah, not much has changed since... Well. You know. Hey. I remember this. Oh, I think that was your mother's. - Yeah. - Yeah. You don't have a Christmas tree? Oh well, no. Not yet. It's always busy, but I'm a little behind this year. It's a great photo of you... - (small chuckle) - Have you done much flying? Hum, no. I mean, regular airlines, yeah, but I haven't been in the right seat in a long time. I'm not really sure I'd remember how. How is Pamela doing? Is she around? Yes. I mean... she's in town... but things didn't work out with us. I'm sorry, Uncle Harry. I always thought you and Pamela were just the perfect couple. Yeah. Anyway... The brochure, how did you get that? It was mailed to my parents. But I take it... you didn't send it? No, I didn't. I would have, but I wasn't sure if you wanted to come to the Anniversary, - and I didn't have your address. - It's okay, don't worry. Your father didn't send you? No. He doesn't even know I'm here actually. I just... I wanted to see you. Well, I'm glad you came. - Me, too. - Alright. Well, I better get back to hanging those lights. I'll let you settle in. You're probably tired after your drive. - Right. Yeah, of course. - Your room is upstairs. - Make yourself at home. - Thanks, Uncle Harry. OK! (sweet piano melody) (door opened and closed) ♪♪♪ Phew... Hey, good morning! How did you sleep? Hey! Uh, good. It's so quiet here, - I slept really well, actually. - Yeah, good. Alright. I made you some coffee. I just have some stuff I need to take care of at the inn, but you can take anything you want - in the fridge. - Thanks! - So what are your plans? - I thought I might head - into town, check things out. - Sounds like fun. - You wanna do dinner later? - Yeah, that'll work. Uh, and to get into town, I just hang a left at the road? - Yeah, that'll get you there. - Cool. Um... You know what? Why don't you just take my truck? It's better for the winter roads. And the ignition sticks a little bit. - Thanks! - Okay. (sweet music) Phew, alright. Here we go...! (engine roaring) ♪♪♪ It still lives up to the name! ♪♪♪ (indistinct conversations) (bell jingling) (holiday music in store) - Can I help you? - I'm just browsing, thanks. - You work here? - My mom owns it. She just went to get us some hot chocolate. I used to come here with my parents when I was your age. It was always the best spot for Christmas decorations. Christmas is the most wonderful time of year! What are you working on? My school report on Amelia Earhart. - She's a pilot and my hero. - Really? - My name is Amelia. - Whoa, you're so lucky! - I'm Scout. - Hi, Scout. - You know, my uncle loves to fly. - Mine too! My uncle was in the Air Force, and my dad's a soldier. They sound very brave. I'll just get this card. Build your own gingerbread house? It's a tradition in Christmas Creek. - You should come tomorrow! - Yeah, maybe. Well, thank you, Scout! Maybe I'll see you later. Bye, Amelia! I've made a list of all the guest names for the Christmas stockings and I was thinking we could use some extra lights around the fireplace. - That's a good idea, Nathan. - I'll call Elise - to put some aside. - Okay, great. - I never knew you had a niece. - I do... I do. I haven't seen her in a while. You know, Amelia was my original co-pilot on Fly By. That's so sweet! And now she's here. It must be so wonderful. It is. It really is. Say, Nathan, you wouldn't have sent a brochure to my brother, did you? - Your brother? - Dan Hughes. I don't think so. I mean... - maybe? - You did? Well, I compiled a list of all addresses and past guests for the past 40 years, for the anniversary of Fly By Santa. And, uh... I'm sorry, I didn't know there were people we weren't sending them to. You're very private, Harry. It's fine. It really is. It's fine. You were just doing your job. OK. Amelia? Hi! I saw you through the window. I heard you were in town. Pamela! Hi! How did you know...? Oh, it's a small town. News travels fast. - Oh... - Actually, Mike Ruggles was in earlier having his cappuccino, so... - Oh, Mike... Yeah. - Yeah, Mike. (laughing) So... - How are you? - Good! I'm actually in town for Fly By Santa, for Christmas. - Are you staying at the inn? - With Uncle Harry at the cabin. Well, say hi to him for me. I don't see him around much these days. Right, yeah. He mentioned that he's pretty busy with things. Yeah, it's been like that for a while now. - Anyway, nice to see you. - You, too, Pamela. - See you soon. - See you soon! (sigh) (engine not starting) (cell phone ringing and vibrating) - Amelia Hughes. - [Hi, honey!] Mom? Mom! Hi! - How was your flight? - [My flight? Uh, I didn't go.] - [What?] - It's fine. - Something came up. - Is everything okay? - Where are you? - [Where am I?] I'm on, uh, a last minute research trip for my app. [I'm fine, I'm just actually in the middle of something.] - [Can I call you later?] - Okay, honey. Love you! - [Good luck.] - OK, love you, too. Bye, Mom. Thanks. Come on. Come on... - Hi. Need a hand? - I'm good. - Are you sure? I don't mind. - No, it's just temperamental. Yeah, OK, sure. I didn't realize this constituted Search and Rescue. Nah, I'm off duty. Just being a good Samaritan. You having fun yet? Besides the recurring car trouble, yeah, it's been great. - Why'd you come back? Really? - It has come to my attention that I may not appreciate Christmas the way I used to. So, here I am, appreciating Christmas. - What is in the box? - Toys - for the Fly By Santa delivery. - Wait-- You help with Fly By? Harry's co-pilot for 16 years. He didn't have anyone else. Right, of course, that makes sense. Harry knows you had no choice in leaving. How about you? You know, we were kids. We tried to keep in touch, but that's life. - Why? - No, that's good. How's Uncle Harry been? That's your family's stuff. I probably shouldn't get involved. - Please, just tell me. - Okay, considering. - He had to give up a lot. - We all did. Harry hasn't really had time - for anything other than work. - Do you mean... Pamela? Like I said, I probably shouldn't get involved. (engine starting) Alright! You just give a little twist - and a whole lot of love. - Thank you, Mike. - Well, I'll see you. - Yeah, see you. Uncle Harry? Are you here? Thanks for helping out, Scout. We're making great progress. Think Harry will let me co- pilot for Fly By Santa one day? It's not an easy job. You really want that responsibility? - I wanna be like you. - That's very sweet. There are lots of girls who are pilots, you know. I know. And you would make a great pilot. You think Dad will be back in time for Christmas? I don't know. He's really busy keeping this country safe. But he'd do anything to be here with you. In the meantime, you got me. I know I'm not your dad, - but I'm your number one uncle. - You're my only uncle. And I also love ya to pieces, so that counts for something. Master off, avionics off, autopilot off, carb heat off, mixture full rich, prop full fine... Thought you couldn't remember? I was just playing around... sorry. I watched you come down here from my office. - Do you wanna come up? - Yeah. Okay, master off, - avionics off, autopilot off... - Mixture - full rich, prop full fine... - See? You remember. Yeah, I guess some things stay with you. I saw Pamela in town today. - She says hi. - Oh, good. How is she doing? Good. When did you two break up? A long time ago. Because we left? She tried to stay... You don't have to tell me. It's okay. It's okay. It was the summer after everybody... left. It was her birthday, we had plans, but there was an emergency at the inn, so... I tried to make it up to her, but, uh... it had happened before. No, she did the right thing. Pamela deserves somebody who'll make time for her. You know, I saw that same regret in Pamela's eyes today. What about you? - Anybody special in your life? - Not anymore. - Did you love the guy? - I don't know. His name was Brad. He wanted me to spend Christmas at his parents' and I didn't, so he broke up with me. And now I'm here and I feel really bad. You know, if he was the right one, you'd probably be with him. Would I? I don't really do big family Christmases, Uncle Harry. And yet, you're here. (laughing) - You hungry? - For dinner? Yeah. I was thinking, get some take-out? OFF, OFF, OFF, ON... Prop full fine, throttle slightly cracked... Starter engaged. Let's go. Here we go. (laughing) Pretty great, isn't it? - It's amazing. - Yeah, there really isn't anything like this. Gives you a new perspective. Like how small and insignificant we are - in the grand scheme of things? - Or infinite. It's freedom up here. I tend to see things differently from a bird's point of view. - Hey, let me help you. - Hey! Sure. I try to do it in one trip. - Most of the time I can. - I remember that, yeah. - I can help you with this. - Oh no, I'm okay. - Okay. - Yeah, just put it down there. Oof! - So I ran into Amelia. - Yeah, she mentioned that. Wow. It must be so strange, good, having her here. Well, I took her flying yesterday. - Wow, I bet she loved that. - Yeah, it was nice. Hey, Harry! Your Christmas mocha. - Coffee from my competitor? - Well, you weren't open, and Phil makes a mean Christmas mocha. Thanks. - Merry Christmas, Phil. - Merry Christmas, Pam. - I was just joking! - Yeah. Um, so Pam, I was... I was thinking-- Oh my gosh! I have biscotti in the oven! I nearly forgot. - Anyway, you were gonna say-- - No, it's not important. - No, what were you-- - No, you better check on that, - 'cause burnt biscotti... - That's true. Okay, well, nice to see you. Good to see you. Always. And... - you were always very clever. - Oh... Amelia, - you made it! - Scout, hey! - You should join us. - Oh, that's so nice, - but I wouldn't want to intrude. - It's not an intrusion. - Mike, hi! - Hey. You know Uncle Mike? Amelia and I used to go to school together way back. We actually used to be best friends. So, you'll join us? It's the first stage of building and the official judging is at the Tree Lighting. - Uh... yeah, sure, okay. - Yeah? Alright. You guys get started. I'll go get pretzels and jellybeans. Okay, you do that. So, you're an uncle? - You seem surprised. - No, it's great. It's actually the best. I'd do anything for Scout and my sis. Wait, so the gift shop is Elise's? Yeah, she took it over about a year ago. - Amazing. Tell her I said hi. - I will. - You have any kids of your own? - Uh... No, not yet. I just haven't found the right person, you know? How 'bout you? Me? Ha, no. I mean, someday I hope. But work's been really busy, and I just got out of a relationship, so... Yeah, just... it wasn't right. We wanted different things. I was actually supposed to be in Turks and Caicos for Christmas. - But you're here. - It's a little strange, I know. I don't think it's strange. Someone over there has a reindeer stables. We have to get really creative if we want to win. Yeah, well, we better get building now! What do you think? - Yeah? Okay. - Let's do it. - Hey, Mom! - What is that? Only the coolest gingerbread house around. And the snowmen are mine. It's not finished yet, but hopefully it's enough to win. - I'll be rooting for you two. - Three. Amelia's helping us. You know Uncle Mike has a friend named after Amelia Earhart? Are we talking about Amelia Hughes? No big deal. Amelia's in town visiting Harry for Christmas. No big deal? She was your best friend for most of childhood. He was pretty obsessed with her. OK, I was not obsessed. It was just a minor crush. - How is she? What's she like? - Beautiful and really cool. She's fine. Normal. - And she says hi. - Fine? Normal? I think we're really gonna have to work on your flirting. Okay, it's not like that. She's just a friend. - Always been just a friend. - Then maybe you won't mind dropping this box off to Harry at the inn? What am I, your delivery boy now? - I prefer Santa's Helper. - Oh, okay. (festive music) - What are you doing? - Oh, hey. Just hanging Christmas stockings for the guests and the staff. It gives them something to open Christmas morning. That's thoughtful... and a lot of work. You do it every year? Well, it's become a bit of a tradition. Can you give me that one? We have so many return guests, we like to personalize it. They have sort of become like family. It's thoughtful with the element of surprise. - Sorry? - My investors would love this. They said Christmas Assist took the thoughtfulness out of gift giving, so... they passed. Well, sometimes things don't work out the way we planned, but it leaves space for something better. Are you saying I should go into the stocking business? Oh yes, I think it'd be very lucrative. Difficult to produce - for millions, though. - That's why you need an app. You know, you're hanging stockings, but the cabin still doesn't have a Christmas tree. Ah, I was hoping that you would help me with that. Oh-- - Santa's delivery service. - Mike! Elise wanted me to bring this by. Some lights and decorations from her gift shop that you put aside. Then I thought... a little Christmas - for your room. - It's so cute! Thank you. Mike, what do you think about helping Amelia find a tree? You're not coming with me? I'd love to, but I got too much to do around here. Sure, I'd love to help out. Great. Come on, get going! Get going! (festive music) Ahh! Well? Let's do this, huh? (laughing) - Oh, I remember this smell. - Yeah, fresh pine trees. There's something special about tree hunting. No offense, but being an outdoorsy Search and Rescue guy, I would've thought you cut down your own tree. I would, I just wanna, you know, - support local businesses. - Ha! Right, that must be it. Hey, don't forget, I'm here helping you. Do you remember when we were kids and we used to pick trees? You always went for the skinniest one. They were the runts of the tree lot. I was just trying to give them a chance at a happy Christmas. - I'm sure they were grateful. - There it is! Okay, I can't take that twig back to the cabin, okay? Sorry. Oh, you see that? Now that is a tree. Um, no, we'll never be able to carry that. Yeah, we can. Come on, I've got faith in us. Well, I am glad one of us does. - Well, shall we? - Okay. I can't believe you still have these decorations. I made this macaroni angel in second grade. - You loved Christmas Angels. - You remember that? - Yeah, of course. - Maybe it's time for an update. No, it is perfect. Okay, well, what do we think? How does it look? - It's beautiful. - It's fantastic. Yeah. Thanks, guys, for getting this great tree. - (phone buzzing) - Oh, sorry. One second. Hey, Carrie, what's going on? [Hey! Just wanted to see how it's going. Any inspiration?] - Oh, yeah, maybe a little. Why? - [Just wondering,] [do you want me to put together a list of other investors,] - [or go back to Bill Burns?] - It's four days till Christmas. Aren't you with your family? We can worry about it all later. [What have you done with my boss?] - [Merry Christmas, Amelia.] - You too, Carrie. - [Bye.] - Bye. Thanks so much for helping me out, both of you. - Of course, Harry. - You guys hungry? What do you say to some dinner, huh? On me. - Yeah, that'd be great. - How about Italian? I think people are surprised to see you out at night. I go out. Sometimes. (laughing) - Hi. - Twice in one day! Aren't I lucky? Hi, guys! - Hi. - Hi, Pam. - Looks really great. - Oh, thanks. Our special today is garlic prawn Fettuccini Alfredo. House made, of course. - Hard to resist. - That sounds so good. Anyway, I'll let you have a few minutes - to decide. - The last time I was here was when Dad took us out and he let me order whatever I wanted. That's because he already knew that he was leaving. I knew something was up when he was so insistent - on paying for dinner. - Good evening, everyone. Thank you for sharing the most wonderful time of the year here with us here at Mistletoe. It's nice to see familiar faces. This first one goes out to an old friend. It was always her favorite. Welcome home, Amelia. (playing Deck the Halls) - Oof! Harry left in a flash. - He got a call from the inn. But honestly, I think he might've been overwhelmed. (chuckling) You know, I forgot Pamela sings. You remember when Harry used to take us to a restaurant and he and Pamela would sing together at the piano? Yeah. There's still something between them. I can tell. Yeah. All this time and... not much has changed, yet everything has. It's strange to think how one moment in time can change - everything for someone. - Yeah. - Why didn't you ever leave? - Christmas Creek? I did. I went to flight school. I was in the air force - for five years as a pilot. - You kidding? That's amazing. My dad got sick, and I wanted to be here in his final days so I moved home. - I had no idea. I'm so sorry. - It's okay. Harry became the closest thing I had to family besides my sister. Elise had Scout, and Will, her husband, was away often, - so I couldn't leave. - Yeah. You know, this town has shown me family in ways I could never give back. But I try nonetheless. I forgot how many stars there were in the sky. The benefit of a small town. Not many lights. Yeah. - You haven't left the city? - Not much. C'mon, I wanna show you something. How did you remember the inn has a telescope? Oh, Harry lets me borrow it whenever I want. I say it's for Scout, but... it's really for me. (laughing) Being near the stars was the reason I was drawn to flying, and flying led me to Search and Rescue. I don't know how you do that. You don't find it scary? No. Not really. What scares me most is all the people I can't help. You're a good person, Mike. Thanks, Meels. So are you. I used to think I was. I had dreams of growing up and doing something remarkable, you know? - Is that what drew you to apps? - I grew up near the tech world. I wanted to be an entrepreneur and creating an app just seemed like the smart thing to do. The world is becoming more reliant on their devices, so I just wanted to bring more convenience into their lives. - Sounds honorable. - Is it? I mean, look at you. You help the people of this town and kids in need. You're a hero. I help people buy things. I'm just a guy, Meels. The same guy you knew growing up. And you... are still the same girl I knew. I don't think that's true. That girl had wide eyes and a sense of wonder. I don't think I have that anymore. Yeah, you do. You know why I know? Because... take a look. - Oh, wow... - Isn't it something? I think that's the Pleiades. Oh my God... Hey! (laughing) - Oh, you are going down, Ruggles! - Whoa! Ah, it's cold! (laughing) You know what, Mike? I missed this. I missed it, too. (laughing) I love that photo. Yeah. Yeah. - Have a good time with Mike? - Yeah, we looked at the stars and then had a snowball fight. Gingerbread cookies! Do you mind? Help yourself. You know, I forgot Grandpa used to fly. Yeah, Dad would bring us up on weekends. I was so surprised that Dan didn't take to it. I suppose his head was always in the books and my head was always in the clouds. - What do you mean? - Oh, well, he was a natural for business. He used to get on my case about taking things more seriously, but I was always greeting the guests and being a showman. A regular Santa Claus. Yeah, but that's who you are. It's who you've always been. - And you're good at it. - It's no way to run an inn, and I had to learn the hard way. - That's when my life changed. - But now the inn is successful, and you've done it by yourself. I think Dad would be proud. Why don't you reach out? Danny and me-- so much has been said - that can't be unsaid, you know? - I don't know. Honestly, I don't even know how it happened between you and Dad and why we had to leave so suddenly on Christmas Eve. Okay, so... when Danny got the offer to work at Baroncrest Hotels and he said he was leaving, I was just so... angry. It was right before Fly By, and I was just so hurt. And I said to him: "Well, if you're leaving, - you might as well leave now." - I see. I know I haven't always dealt with things in the best way. I've said a lot of things I'm not proud of, and... I'm so sorry that I never reached out to you guys over the years. I wanted to. But for what it's worth, I never wanted any of you to leave. I've missed you, Uncle Harry. I've missed you, too, Amelia. (He hums We Wish You a Merry Christmas.) Ah, there you are. Good afternoon. Good afternoon. I got caught working on my app, or trying to, - and now I need a break. - Well, perfect timing. I just made us some lunch, so help yourself, take something to eat, and when you're done, - come meet me at the plane. - Are we going flying again? No, this time we are decorating it. - Just like old times. - That's right. So eat up. And then she gets me with a snowball in the back of my neck. I was shocked, considering I don't think she's played in the snow since she was 13. What? Nothing. Don't get ahead of yourself. I told you we're just friends. - It's nice to see you happy. - I'm always happy. You've spent your whole life giving to others. You make your work, your family, your charity the most important. You deserve love, too. - OK, stop. We're just friends. - Okay. Yeah, you just keep on telling yourself that. - (phone buzzing) - Look who it is! - Scout! - Is it Dad? It's Dad! - Dad, I wrapped your present! - [You did?] [I can't wait to get it. Is your mom there?] I'm here. Hi, honey, how are you? [Hi, sweetie. I'm good. Good now.] - When are you coming home? - [As soon as I can.] - [Is that Mike in the back?] - Hey, looking good, Will. [Hey, Mike. Thanks for taking care of my girls for me.] [What are you talking about? They're keeping an eye on me.] Will you be home for Christmas? [There's nowhere else I wanna be than home for Christmas.] [I'm gonna do everything I can to be there. You just-- ] Dad? Dad? Are you there? It's okay. I can't believe it's the 40th Anniversary of Fly By Santa and you still have the same plane. Yeah, well, she's a classic. Lucky for us, the lake hasn't frozen over. That always makes Fly By a little extra challenging. Did you always know what you loved? Yeah, I've always loved flying. I think the things we love are always a part of who we are. We just have to remember that. When I was younger, I wanted to help people. Well, you do. I mean, apps help people, - don't they? - They can, but I'm worried the people who turned down my app were right. I'm seeing how much my past has colored the way I see Christmas. And now, being here with you and Mike, and getting to be a part of Christmas again, I'm just not sure what I'm supposed to do with my life. Lucky for you, you're surrounded by the peace and quiet of this place for a few days. Maybe afterwards you'll feel a little more clear. - Yeah, maybe. - It's kind of simple. Just find out the thing that you love and it'll all sort itself out. Just follow your heart. That is a lot of bumper stickers. I figure one of them will stick. So, are you gonna follow your heart? We're not talking about me here. Maybe not, but we should be. Alright. It's looking good. Yeah, it better, considering it took us most of the day! Guess I still make the best co-pilot, huh? I thought I was your best co-pilot? You know what? I think I'm gonna let you two guys battle this out. I got something I need to take care of. Okay, see ya. - Came to see if you're hungry? - Yes, starving. Oh, and I know where Uncle Harry keeps the best snacks. - Really? - Come on. Yeah. You ever wonder what our lives would be like if I didn't move? Yeah, sometimes. Are you happy that you stayed? Yeah, I mean, I went to the air force knowing I was gonna come back and raise a family. I just came back a little sooner. Yeah, I guess I just always imagined my life to look different. You know, I'd like to get married one day, but can you imagine my dad and Uncle Harry at a wedding? Not exactly the place for a family reunion. And I certainly don't want my kids growing up thinking families that don't talk are normal. Well, what would you do differently? For starters, I wouldn't be afraid to tell my parents - that I'm here. - They don't know you're here? Hey... It's okay that you want to be here. And... I'm really glad that you are. I am, too. Here's a crazy idea. What if we're meant to be here, roasting chestnuts on an open fire, and you being here is gonna, you know, get your dad and Harry back together again? I love your hopeful optimism, but that is very unlikely. Do you ever wish you could just go back in time and change that moment? You mean the moment when you left? Yeah. Yeah, I do. Life is a lot out of our control, and we should just be grateful about moments like this. - Oh, it's hot. - Are you okay? - Yeah, I think so. - Let me see. Mike? Uh, sorry to interrupt... that... (laughing) - Scout's on the phone for you. - Thanks, I'll be right there. (laughing) - I guess we better go, huh? - Yeah, I guess so. Oh, sorry, the kitchen is closed. Hi. Actually, I... just came by to see you. Oh. Uh... - Can I get you a drink? - Oh yeah, that'd be nice. - How about a glass of your-- - I remember. - Oh. Thanks. - You're welcome. - Well... cheers. - Cheers. - It's been a long time since-- - It was lovely hearing-- - Ladies first. - I was going to say, it's been a long time since I've heard you play. And it was lovely hearing you. - It just brought back... - A lot of memories? Yeah. Good ones.

Actually, something different. Meet me in the lobby in ten? Okay. (whistling) Hey, you started without me. Well, you're a little late. I said ten minutes. I was only like eleven minutes. Well, you look nice. Thank you. Wow, look at all these toys. The kids are going to be so happy. Yeah. It's my favorite part of Fly By Santa. The faces. - Thanks for helping. - Oh, of course. I'm happy to. Please. It's all about the giving, right? Well, lunch is on me. Alright, who am I kidding? It's all about the receiving. (indistinct) - Amelia! - Hi! Mike! Hi! Wow! I was just thinking about you. I just filled a box with toys for Fly By Santa. That is great. Thank you. - We're actually here for lunch. - Well! - Well, sit anywhere you'd like. - Great, thank you. Can I bring you a glass of wine? Uh, yeah. Yeah, sure. - Okay. - Great. Is it just me, or does Pamela - look happier than last time? - Yeah, she sure does. What are you going to get? Oh. Um... maybe the steak? You're gonna get the steak at an Italian restaurant? The steak is the right choice in any restaurant, and it is amazing here, - for the record. - Okay, I'll keep that in mind. Okay, here we go. That's for you. That's for you. - Have you had a chance to decide? - Yes. I'll have the spaghetti. - Good choice. - The steak. Medium. You got it. - Skaal. - Skaal. - I love this place. - I practically have a tab here. - Do you cook much? - Yeah, a little. It's not so much fun cooking on your own. - Yeah, I know what you mean. - I'm, uh... I'm officiating the Tree Lighting tonight for fun. You could be my date-- I mean, if you want. Yeah, I would love to. - Yeah? - Yeah. Okay. Be fun, right? Yeah, it will. I recommend heading into town this afternoon for our Annual Tree Lighting and Gingerbread House Contest. (buzzing sound) Uh, excuse me. Hello? Uh, this is Nathan from Hughes' Family Inn. Amelia? Uh, she's not here. Can I take a message? Maybe Harry can help you with your concern. One moment, please. Hello? Hello? They hung up. - Whose phone is this? - Amelia's. Oh, and I'm doing the final toy pick-up tomorrow - before Fly By Santa, wanna join? - Yeah, that sounds fun. - Yeah? Good. - Yeah. - Amelia, there you are. - Uncle Harry, we just went into town for lunch. Is everything okay? - Your phone was ringing. - I left my phone here? Oops. Nathan answered it, he handed the phone to me, and well... Mom and Dad called? They know I'm here. [Hi there, you've reached the Hughes.] [We're not here right now. Please leave a message.] Hey, everything okay? I tried calling. They're not answering. I'm sure everything is fine. Try not to jump to conclusions. Please don't tell me not to jump to conclusions. I know my dad, he's going to be upset. - What do I say? - How about the truth? - Come on, we should get going. - No, - I gotta check on Uncle Harry. - Meels, are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. I just... I have to talk to Uncle Harry. I tried calling, - and they won't answer. - Well, you're lucky. They hung up on me before I had a chance to say hello. - I'm sorry. - It's not your fault. I don't know what I was expecting. My brother has always been stubborn. - Us Hughes are all stubborn. - Yeah. I was rude to Mike. And he left. I'm sure Mike understands. My ex Brad says that I push people away when I get upset. I have no idea what that feels like. It must be our family pattern. I'm pretty sure all my problems are because of what happened all those years ago... I lost you, and Mike, and-- You did not lose Mike, and you certainly haven't lost me. I worry. Ever since then, I don't really let people in. I'm not going anywhere, Amelia, OK? Me neither, Uncle Harry. They called, so what? I'm not gonna let it ruin my night, are you? - No, sir. - Hm! (laughing) (festive music) - Hey. - Oh, hey! - Brought you hot chocolate. - Oh! You're sweet. Well, it's Christmas and everything. Perfect timing. I was just closing up shop. Yeah. Harry, what's going on? Nothing, I'm.... you know, just drinking - hot chocolate... - I mean... You know what I mean. Yeah. Look, I know I made a lot of mistakes and... the biggest mistake I made was letting you walk away. I didn't fight for our relationship, when I should have. I want to believe you, but I don't know if I can I trust that things have changed. I get that. I do. But with Amelia home, we've had some... pretty interesting conversations. I saw how much I was letting my life pass by, and... I'm not willing to do that anymore. I guess I was just so afraid that you were going to leave me that I pushed you away first. So I don't blame you for giving up on me. And I'm sorry I hurt you the way I did. But you've always had my heart. - The mistletoe's a nice touch. - I did it for the restaurant. Okay, maybe I was hopeful. Well, in that case, will you be my date, - and join me in the Town Square? - I would love to. - (bell jingling) - Good evening, Christmas Creek! My name Mike Ruggles and I'm proud to officiate the Annual Tree Lighting and Gingerbread House Contest! (cheers and applause) You know, there's a reason why I've called this town my home for almost 30 years, and this year, you've outdone yourselves. Everything looks amazing. So, without further ado, on the count of three, let us light the tree! One, two... Three! (cheers and applause) Brilliant work, everybody! - Amelia! - Elise, hi! - Merry Christmas! - So good to have you home. - Nice to see you. - I'm gonna go to Scout. Alright, last chance to check out the Gingerbread Houses and also get your vote in here. We will tally the winner soon, and may the best house win! Hey... Hey. - I'm sorry about earlier, Mike. - It's okay. No, it's not. I was pushing you away. You didn't deserve it. I wasn't just trying to make you feel better. I meant it. I know everything's gonna be okay. I hope so. All I want for is for my family rift to be healed, all of us to be happy. This was the first Christmas I was actually enjoying in a while, and now I'm just worried about my parents. Don't lose hope, okay? (bell jingling) Duty calls. (laughing) - I'll see you in a bit. - Okay. Alright, folks, the votes are in... and the winner of the Gingerbread House Contest is... none other than my very own niece, Scout Redding! I had nothing to do with the voting, I promise. Mom, can you take a photo - for Dad? - Yes, yes. Ready? Merry Christmas, everyone! Enjoy the festivities! I'll never forget the look on Scout's face - for as long as I live. - Hey, how about a cup - of hot apple cider? - Yeah, I'll come with you. Mom, Dad? - What're you doing here? - We came for Christmas. - Danny? - Hi, brother. - This cider's really good. - Oh, thank you. It's a Hughes family recipe. We used to make it as a family. The inn looks good. Thanks. We're all booked up, but I'm sure we can figure out a place for you to stay. Actually, we had an early check-out this morning, so I put them upstairs. I hope that's okay? - Great. Put them on my bill. - You don't have to pay for me, - darling. - Dad, please, I want to. We can take care of our own bill. Alright, you guys, if you want to get changed, - Christmas dinner's almost ready. - Great. I know Christmas isn't for two days, but we've got a lot of Christmases to make up for, so I thought - we should start now. - This is wonderful, thank you. - Everything looks delicious. - Thank you, Helena and Pamela. Thank you. Growing up in Denmark, my most precious memories were of the long smorgasbord meals around the table. I've missed this... So here is to our family, all together again. - Merry Christmas! Skaal! - (all): Skaal! Well, I am grateful to be included. Thank you. Of course. You're family. You've always been there for me - and I really appreciate that. - Is that supposed to mean I wasn't there for you? Well, those are your words, not mine. You know, you can pretend everything was fine, but you knew as well as I did the inn was struggling. - I couldn't do it by myself. - You weren't. We were partners. Mom and Dad built this inn so you and I could run this. Except I did all the work! And we could barely make ends meet, let alone support two families, so I made a choice. - The one I had to make... - You made the choice of going all the way across the country and becoming CFO of some company? Will you both please stop? Honey, why didn't you tell us you were here, spending Christmas with my brother? I had to find out from the bellman. Actually, I'm the front desk clerk. Not important. Enjoy your dinner. I'm sorry. I didn't tell you because I knew you would be upset. I had a right to come home. Uncle Harry is my uncle. This isn't my feud, and I feel like I've been in the middle of it my entire life. I'm tired of it. - Honey. - No. If we don't have each other, then what do we have? Look at us. We're all... adults and yet we're just behaving like children. Amelia! Honey, wait! Excuse me. Sorry. What are you doing? This is why I do Turks and Caicos alone every Christmas instead of spending it with family. I'll never be able - to fix this. - Look, you're upset, I understand, but you don't have to leave. You can stay at my sister's tonight. Let everyone cool off. You don't get it. You don't know them like I do. - It won't work. - I'm just trying to help. I don't want your help. I'm sorry. The Amelia I know wouldn't walk away from her family when they need her most. Please don't go. (sighing) Oh, uh, you guys are leaving? I think it's best. Harry, have you seen Amelia? She won't answer our calls. I think she was sleeping this morning when I left. - Maybe she went into town? - Well, now I'm worried. - I'm sure she's fine, Helena. - I'm going to ask Nathan if he's seen or heard from her. You've been running this all yourself? Uh, yes, apart from Nathan. Hm. Who's your accountant? I am. I had to learn. - You did a great job, Harry. - I suppose you're gonna point out all the ways in which I failed, yeah? I'm serious. Mom and Dad would be proud. This is exactly what they wanted. Thanks. That means a lot coming from you. I lost my job in San Francisco, which is why we moved to Chicago. I gave them everything and they replaced me with a kid fresh out of college. Danny, why didn't you say anything? I was embarrassed, after all we've been through... I tried to do right by my family and now I'm jobless. Nathan said that Amelia's car is gone. She left last night. Hey. Can I get you another coffee? I'm good. Hey, thank you for letting me stay at your place last night. I just... I needed some space. Loving the Hughes family isn't always easy, but over the years, I've learned that if you give them time, eventually they come around. I hope so. Oh, my friend Judy took these at the Tree Lighting. - Might cheer you up. - Thanks, Pamela. Of course. - (ringing) - [Amelia?] - [Well, this is a surprise.] - Hi, Bill. I'm so sorry to bother you on Christmas Eve. I just had a new take on the Christmas app that I wanted - to share with you right away. - [Okay.] - [Well, I'm listening.] - I'm thinking the app will be a charity focused on bringing people together, so that no one has to celebrate Christmas alone. It's about the gift that matters most: Being present rather than giving presents. [I like the sound of that. I think] [it's exactly what we're looking for. After the holidays,] [let's sit down and talk specifics.] - I would love that. Thank you. - [Thank you.] - [Oh! Merry Christmas.] - Merry Christmas! - You heading out? - Yeah, I'm ready. What's this? I just got this from the Fly By Santa run. Maybe you wouldn't mind delivering these to Mike for me? Mike? Umm... Amelia... don't shut him out. Don't walk away from him like I did Harry. You'll regret it, - trust me. - You're right. Thank you, Pamela. Mom? I'm okay. Can you all meet me in the cabin in thirty minutes? - Amelia? - I'm in here. - Honey, you're here. - We were so worried! I know. I'm sorry. Wanna have a seat? The cabin looks almost the same. Didn't really have a reason to change it. Harry puts up stockings for all the guests who stay at the inn over Christmas because they have become like family to him. I thought it was important to do it for those who are my family. Since I've been here, I've seen townspeople treat neighbors like family and I was reminded what the spirit of Christmas is about. It has nothing to do with gifts, and everything to do with who we spend our time with. There are people who have lost their family and would do anything to spend time with them again and here we are, a family, and we've turned on each other when we needed one another most. Dad, you chose to leave because you thought it was the best thing for your family. And Uncle Harry, you took on the inn and saved it from closure without anyone else's help. You both had the best intentions. You both sacrificed a part of your lives for something bigger than yourselves. You're more the same than you are different. So why are you too stubborn to see that? It makes me so sad. Love and family are truly the most important things in the world. That's what Christmas Creek and this inn is all about. If we don't have each other, then what do we have? At last! (laughing) Thank you, honey, for coming back to the inn and bringing us back together. - I'm so glad that you came. - I'm sorry for keeping you from your uncle and from Christmas Creek. I know a lot of this was my fault. Yeah, kinda, but it was also my fault, too. You know, I managed this place without you, and it wasn't easy and it wasn't always fun. There happens to be a job opening that's presented itself. CFO. If you want your old job back, we can run this inn the way Mom and Dad intended, as a family. That is, if you're looking for work. I've never wanted anything more. But you know, I do have a few ideas on how we could streamline things. OK, feel free to leave them in the suggestion box in the lobby. (laughing) Um, you know what? If you don't mind, there is someplace that I really need to be. You know, before you go, I've got a little proposition for you. Merry Christmas. Thank you. Thank you. Baseball bat! Thank you. Merry Christmas. Thank you. Meels? - You're here... - Pamela asked me to give this to you. Mike, I'm so sorry. I never left. I couldn't, because you're right. It's not who I am. All that matters to me are the people I love. My family is going to be okay. And the only person that I wanted to tell was you. Mike, you always were my best friend, the person who had my back, but now you are so much more than that. You are the brightest light I know. I can't lose you again. I love you, Mike Ruggles. That was-- - A lot, I know. - Amazing. I've been waiting 17 years to do that. So have I. I love you, Meels. I always have. - That is a lot of presents. - Yeah. I hope Harry's okay with an extra-large delivery tonight. Actually, Harry wanted to take the night off, so I said that we would do Fly By Santa. What do you think? I think that would be awesome. Come on, help me pack it up. Okay. Oh boy, this feels like Christmas. - Dad? He's here. Mom, look! - Hey! - Scout! Oh! - I can't believe you're here! I can't believe you're home! I thought you weren't gonna make it. - Why didn't you tell me? - I wanted to surprise you. I love you so much. How many deliveries do we make? Just the two neighboring towns. They only have access by plane. So, you ready, Mrs. Claus? Um, not yet. Merry Christmas, Mike. All this time and... not much has changed. Yet everything has. (laughing) It's perfect. Thank you. My turn. I've been holding onto this for a long time. You left before I could give it to you that night. - A Christmas Angel! - You'll always be my Angel. I love it, Mike. Thank you. You know, we'll see each other, we'll figure it out. You can fly to me and I'll fly to you-- I'm not worried. We found each other again, and I'm not letting you go. - Remember how to fly this thing? - Um, yes. - Uncle Harry already took me up. - Oh, he did? Well, come on, then. Watch your step. There you go. Now, - are you ready, Mrs. Claus? - With you, Ruggles... always.
