[music playing] -You guys have no respect for a perfectly good hangover. This is how we should go up the Goddess, boys. Lightweight, lean and mean. -Absolutely everything you need on your back. -Just keep climbing. I still can't believe it. -Well you better believe it man, because we're going to Everest. -It blows me away they gave the permit to Dodger. -Hey! Hey, what is that supposed to mean? They just recognized I'm a man of excellent character. -I want to do that little spur, the on in the third set. Nobody's done that route. I'll lead, OK? -I can't. -I don't know how you can worry about the rest of the world when you're up here. -Gotta eat, man. I'll come back tomorrow, get Lucy to cover my shift. -All right. -I won't drink. [laughter] -Yeah, like that's going to happen. -All right, who's going first? -I'll go. -All right boys. -On three, eh? -One, two, three, eh? [music playing] -See you boys. -See ya. [nature sounds] -One generation to another. Before the mountains were brought-- [music playing] -It's time to say a word about the finest man it has been my pleasure to climb with, John Lauchlan. Well you know I'm the one I said who should climb Everest, but it was John who said we will climb Everest. And yeah, because of John I got the permit. We'll climb her, but not with John. That's a goddamn shame. To John Lauchlan. -To John. -Guts and glory man. -Guts and glory. -Can you imagine taking that first step onto Everest? I get to the Western Cwm, I'm happy. -We'll get you there, man. John as inspiration, lightweight expedition, lean and mean. -But even lightweight we're going to need financing and sponsors. -Forget that. We do it ourselves. -Airline tickets? Food? Clothing? Equipment? Oxygen tanks? Tents? Come on Roger, I don't see you contributing anything. -Really? -Yes. -Except the permit. The reason we can climb the mountain. -Mary. I'm sorry. -No, it's OK. I'm going to miss him so much. -It shouldn't have happened to him. -I have something for you. I want you to take it to Everest with you. -I just keep thinking that if the mountains can take a climber like John, they can take anyone. I don't want this. -We have to behave for the sponsors, speak nicely to the goddamn cameras. Refrain from profanity. -Well it wouldn't hurt, Roger. -You know what? Kiss my ass. -I know what the problem is here Roger, you. You're the problem. -Give me a few dozen granola bars, 100 feet of rope, I'll climb that goddamn mountain. -You, you corporate lackey, you're trying to turn this into a circus. -I'm the one who wants to make this work, and you're going to screw it up. -You know what? This jerk has already gone behind our backs. He's talking to sponsors. -That's right. 14 companies, and they'll pay for everything, airfare, food, sherpas. -The hell is wrong with you? -Come on, man. -Go home. -Nice Roger, that's nice. [music playing] [applause] -I'm a climber and team business manager. On my left we have our technical director and senior climber, Laurie Skreslet. And one of our most experience climbers, Rusty Bailey. [applause] Our official expedition photographer from Edmonton, Alberta, Par Morrow. [applause] A last minute addition to the team, from Vancouver, British Columbia, our cameraman Blair Griffiths. Deputy leader Lloyd Kiwi Gallagher. Last, but not least, the tenacious Dave Read. [applause] And now I'd like to introduce you to the newest member of our team, I'm sure most of you know him by reputation, William March. Come up here, Bill. [applause] -What's March doing here? -You missed the meeting, Roger. -Bill has extensive Himalayan experience, as well as having climbed in the Andes and the Alps. And it is with the hardy endorsement of the Rocky Mountain Climbing Society and our sponsors, this morning the climbers voted for Bill March to lead this expedition. [applause] -Matt planned to do this to me, that son of a bitch. -Hey it's cool, let him be the figurehead. -Yeah, he'll do all the administration and paperwork. -Yeah, let them lead while you go to the top. -I'd like to take this opportunity to thank our sponsors, Mr. Fenwick of Air Canada, BioTech Equipment, and Alpine Investors, for giving us this wonderful opportunity and becoming part of the dream to put this team on Mount Everest. And now with pleasure I give you the leader of the Big Red Machine, Mr. Bill March. [applause] -It's in man's nature to go out and climb the mountains and sail the seas, fly to the moon and plunge into the depths of the ocean. By doing these things we touch something outside ourselves. Expand our being, and revel in the illusion that we are masters of our world. So we go to Everest. [applause] One exciting new development I'm pleased to announce, for the first time in history we will be able to broadcast direct from the mountain to the world. [applause] Are there any questions? Yes, Mr. march, how many do you plan to put on the top? -How many do we have again? -Bill, what do you say to Gustav Mintz, who says in an overview of the London Interpreter, and I quote, the mountain's going to eat them up. -Well then we'll give her a damn good case of indigestion. [applause] [music playing] -Have you seen the Dodge? -No, I haven't. -Bill. -Roger left yesterday for Kathmandu. -Oh goddammit. -You take good care of yourself. -I will, Blair. You too. -I will. -Write me? -Every day. -Listen. Every night I want you to look at the North Star, and I'll do the same. All right? -Sally, I promise this is the last one. -You said that last time. You said Aconcagua would be the last. -This is Everest. -Blair, Blair, you joined the team just a couple of days ago. You've barely had time to pack. -Yeah, well I'm just honored to be here with these guys. -Blair, you just joined the team-- -I'm working here. -Ah yes, the printed word, noble. -You're such a selfish bastard! If you get on that plane Dave, I am filing for divorce. -Sally, Sally wait. -Dibs on the window seat. [music playing] -Hey guys, what do you play? -Mountains! [music playing] -Hey John who is that guy? -His name's Eric Paxton. -I thought he was on K2 with his brother? -Gentlemen, this is Eric Paxton. Some of you know him, you've certainly all heard of him. I asked him to meet us here and join the team. -Bill, can we talk to you for a minute. You never said anything about Paxton joining the team, Bill. You know, I really don't think we even need him. -You some sherpas won't climb with him, they think it's bad karma. -He's one of the strongest men I've ever climbed with. -We can really use him on the upper part. -Yeah, more like him using us. -You know I say we put this to a vote. -Me too. -Gentleman you seem to be under the illusion that this is a democracy. Eric Paxton is joining the team as a senior climber. -Wow. -Good evening, Mr. March, Miss Winegate. -Sargent Dorjay. This is Sargent Dorjay of the Kathmandu police department. What can we do for you, sir. -We would like to question one of your climbers, Roger Marshall. INTERPOL contacted us, he might be involved in some drug exporting expenses. -He left the expedition. -Yeah, he's no longer in Kat. -You know I heard he left yesterday. -We haven't really seen him. -I'm sorry Sargent, he doesn't seem to be here. -If a member of your expedition were involved in drugs, your permit would be immediately canceled. -Of course we're aware of that. -And I can assure you he's no longer on this expedition. -Good. If Mr. Marshall should appear please contact me. -Of course, thank you. -Thank you sir. -Have a good evening. -Stupid son of a bitch. -Hey Bill. -Norman, welcome. -I'd like to ask you a few more questions. Who was that? -The mayor wishing us well. People are so friendly here. -They must be pleased to have North Americans. I heard there was a Russian expedition last year, they were crazy. -Oh, you ain't seen nothing. [shouting] [singing] [clapping] -No, absolutely not. The lads, can I interest you in a quiet beer down the street? -I was hoping you'd say that. [music playing] -Let's see if you can walk as well as you drink. We can get to base camp in about two weeks. But you know what? I'm going to give you three. Lazy stroll to acclimatize slowly. Enjoy this rich air, gentlemen. It's going to get a lot thinner. [music playing] -Rock on. -Guts and glory, man. -Guts and glory. [music playing] -I understand you climbed with John Lauchlan on Annapurna? He spoke very highly of you. -He was a good man. Annapurna was tough, but you could depend on Lauchlan. -He and I go way back. I was actually with him the day that he fell. -Yes, I know. And now he's gone, and here you are. [climber singing in background] -Whoa, whoa, whoa. Don't do it. -You can't take it. -Think about it, think about it. -No we can't take it man. -Oh. -Well done. Thank you for that. -Namaste. -Namaste. -Hey, what exactly does Namaste mean? -It's a blessing. It means I salute the God within you. -Namaste. -Namaste. -Wow, you're popular. -Oh it's not the God in me they like, it's the camera. -That camera's worth more than most Nepalese earn in a lifetime. -Don't worry though, they'd never think of stealing it. -Push down on that, right there. When we get back I want to make a feature doc of the expedition. What do you think? -I think I'll let you know when I'm ready for my close-up. -Oh no, no, no, no, no you'll break the lens. Why not? Hey Hitchcock was in all his films, right? Is that good? [music playing] -There's the hill, lads. -Sagarmatha. That's what the Nepalese call it. The Tibetans call it Chomolungma. -What does that mean? -The Goddess of the Earth. -I think this is a broadcast opportunity, Blair? -Here? -All right now everyone, look smart. Confidence and determination. OK, we're on. Greetings to those at home. This is Bill March and the Big Red Machine on our way to Everest. We're making good time to our base camp, and as you can see, we're now in sight of the Goddess. We'll be sending these broadcasts from time to time so you can keep track of our progress. Anything you'd like to say lads? -Hi, mom. -Hi, Dave's mom. [music playing] -Namaste. -Namaste. -How are you? -Very well. Good to see you. -This is Lhakpa Tshering, a strong veteran, a good man. -Excellent. [speaking foreign language] -Sungdare, who has been to the summit twice, but cannot get here on time. And Pasang Sona, a new sherpa. He gets to prove himself. They have all been blessed by the Lama and they are ready to go. -Thank you. Gentlemen, these men are our partners in this climb. We will be working alongside them as comrades in arms. [muted conversations] -Blair. -Blair. -Namaste, Laurie. Sungdare, you've been to the summit of Chomolunga twice? [speaking foreign language] [nature sounds] [chanting] [speaking foreign language] -Lama mountain says the mountain is trouble. This season the Goddess is unhappy. -What does he mean, unhappy? -It's a mountain. We have good weather, we have bad weather. We deal with it. [speaking foreign language] -It's not a good year. You must have extra blessings and take great care. -And how much will that cost? -John, please. [music playing] -Each one is for a person who died on Everest. [music playing] -The Goddess awaits. [music playing] -Anybody home? -Hey guys. -Hey, Peter! -Welcome to the Big Red Machine base camp. -Holy crap. Heated tents, soft beds! -Nice. -It's like the Hilton. -It looks marvelous Peter, you've done a wonderful job. -Ah, thanks. Yeah guys all of your equipment is inside your tents. The latrine is on the other side of that little ridge over there. The cook tent slash dining room is this big white tent here. -Which way to the beach, Peter? -Roger Dodger! -You bums made it! I've been waiting for days, eh! Hey Laur! -Hey Dodge! -Old man Paxton. -Hello. -Roger. -So, here we are. -I want a word with you. -Yeah Bill, no. -This isn't funny Roger. -Sure it is. It's goddamn hilarious. -Will you come? Anything you have to say to me, say it here. -All right, fine. You're off the expedition. Ha-ha -I'm not kidding, Roger. The sponsors feel that you're a liability to the climb. -This is my climb, Bill. I organized this thing. The only one that's going to leave is you. -The police are looking for you Kat. You've been exporting drugs from here. -What are you talking about? -You almost got us all thrown out of Nepal. -You forgot one fact El Commandant -Yeah? What's that? -The permit is mine. -I'm sorry Roger, you're off the expedition. -I'm not going anywhere. Who's going to make me? You? Bill? -I'm the leader of this expedition, Roger. -Well sure, knock yourself out. Just don't get in the way. -Hey Rog, I'm bunking with you. -Right lads. Better go to your tents and double check on all your equipment. [music playing] -Roger, without the sponsors we'd still be in Canada. And this drug thing is a time bomb if the press get a hold of it. -I'll sort it out. -It's pretty dumb, Roger. -I said I'd sort it out. -It's not good enough, Roger. Bill wants you out. -You're going to listen to this limey toy soldier? -Anyway he can't throw you out, the whole thing was your idea. -I was on Nuptse with Bill in '80. He led. We were laying rope at camp 3, descending to camp 2. We were going to stay at camp 2, but Bill ordered us down to camp 1 for the night. The other climbers argued, and so did I. We just wanted to rest. But Bill insisted. We left the camp unmanned. By the time we climbed back up the next morning all of the tents had been buried under a massive rock slide. I trust his instincts. I'm following him. Good night. -I didn't know he was such a teacher's pet. [music playing] NEWS ANCHOR (VOICEOVER): You are seeing something here that's never been seen before. A live television feed of Mount Everest is being transmitted out to a satellite in space, and then back here to North America. Our subject tonight is Mount Everest. Even as you see the mountain, it is under siege by a crack team of Canadian and sherpa climbers doing what has never been done before. -Hi guys, this is Kathmandu to base camp, we've got you. [music playing] -The ice fall shifts about a foot in the day, but it's not consistent. It might not move for 10 days. The pressure builds, and then in a split second it will move 10 feet. Except for the summit itself it's the most dangerous section of the mountain. We have to avoid the major crevasses, but stay away from the potential avalanches off the west face. And always climb early morning, before the sun softens the snow and makes it less stable. Eric Paxton, you'll take first lead. [music playing] -Looks like a graveyard. [music playing] -Good to go? -Secure. Good to go. [music playing] -Skin flap! That's what we can call him. -Roger would you lay off Bill? He knows what he's doing. -What? Told him he could leave. Hey, you're right, you're right. Maybe I don't make the greatest leadership material. I lack, I don't know, what? Organizational skills? -Manners? -Yeah there's that. Let the tin soldier do his thing. -Just give it a rest. -Fine. You're going to be like that, you put in the ice pick. [rumbling] -Holy. -What? -Sorry, sorry. That was close. You should have seen the look on your face. -I'm glad you're enjoying yourself. [laughter] [music playing] -Go. -We're making fine progress cutting a path through the ice fall. And tomorrow we hope to establish camp 1, at the beginning of the Western Cwm. Then the hard work of staging begins, carrying oxygen and equipment up to each camp on the mountain. But I do have to say, what will put us on top will have to do with the determination, discipline, and seriousness that this team reveals every day. Stop the camera. Stop the camera. Oh that's disgusting. Just stop it. Stop the camera. [laughter] That's great, that's very very mature. [wind howling] -This is going to take some time. [music playing] -Last one to Camp 1 doesn't get to summit! [music playing] -That's a fine way to wear yourselves out. -Hey, you can see base camp! -We'll call you when the tents are up, over. -Cheerleader Bill. -The sherpa's told me that because the mountain is a Goddess, when they get here it's like children climbing onto the lap of the Goddess. They refer to the Cwm as her apron, a sacred place, the valley of silence. -Lap of The Goddess, eh? Always wanted to spend the night in the lap of a goddess. -Show some respect man. Pure thoughts. -That was a pure thought. -Let's get the tents up. [wind howling] [music playing] -John? Blair. Roger. -I can't believe this. I'm getting fan mail. She saw my picture, she wants to have my children. She says it's our destiny to be together. -You guys believe in that? Destiny? God's pulling our strings? -Absolutely. -If it means getting laid. -Yeah, this is the last expedition for me. Promised the wife. -This is the first time for me. I'm a high climber now, very happy. -Congratulations. -Congratulations, Pasang. BILL (ON RADIO): Base camp, base camp, this is camp 1. Come in, base camp. -Base camp here Bill, go ahead. -Hello Kiwi. Well first I'd like to announce that in securing the route to the ice fall in just three days, we have broken the 1979 Japanese record by one full day. [cheering] -That fantastic Bill. BILL (ON RADIO): Congratulations. And thanks to all of you. -Now as we continue up the mountain, we'll begin a two days on, one day off schedule. BILL (ON RADIO): Rest days will be increasingly important the higher we go. -Hey Bill, Rusty here, I was just wondering, if we carry extra loads, will it sweeten our chances to summit? BILL (ON RADIO): No, summitting will depend on being in the right place at the right time. -But I will say that the more you put into this mountain, the more she gives back. It's just good karma. Now I want you all to get some shut eye. It's a 3:00 AM crawl. Radio up to us for a weather check before the first carry, all right? You've got that? -Copy that. And happy karma to you, Bill. -Right, happy karma. And Kiwi, was there any mail today? -Yeah, there's a couple for you and one for Eric from his brother. We'll call in at 3:00 AM. -Good night lads, over and out. -Going up Peter? -Yeah, thought I might take a load up to camp on, just to say I did. -Good for you. -You do sleep? -Believe me, I do Pasang. You guys will be in my dreams. -What is it? -It snowed last night. Maybe too much of snow. -I'll do a weather check. -Snowing when you got up? -It was a little bit like this, but I don't know what it's like up there. -Camp 1, this is base camp, come in camp . Camp one? Come in camp one, this is base camp for weather check. No response. -Well we'll take it slow. -Just keep doing radio checks on your way up. If it gets too deep, turn around. -All right. -Have fun! [music playing] -Whoa, that ladder's really shifted. -Yeah, we'll have to re-secure it. -Hey you guys go ahead, I'll fix it. [music playing] -See you in awhile. -Base camp, base camp, this is Camp 1. Come in, base camp. -There you are! What happened, you guys sleep in? We though you got eaten by the Yeti! -No, the batteries died. Are there climbers ready for the carry? -We're halfway through the ice fall, Bill. We've got some snow here, how is it up there? -Just give me a second. [wind howling] We've had heavy snow here. We shouldn't have carried today. -We're not too deep here. -But it's very deep here. It's a concern. -Yeah well we're halfway there, Bill. Should we continue? -All right, but be careful. Any sign of instability, stop and call me. Base camp this is Bill at Camp 1, no more carries today. I repeat, we are canceling any further carries from base camp today. Please acknowledge, over. Bloody hell. [ice cracking] [avalanche] -Avalanche! -This is Camp 1 here, Camp 1. Anyone in the ice fall, come in. Anyone in the ice fall respond. This is Camp 1. -Laurie at base camp, come back. -Yes this is Bill in Camp 1, did you hear it? -Yeah, we heard it. [snow crunching] -You there? [ice shifting] -Camp 1. Camp 1 come in. -Camp 1 here. What happened? -Big avalanche, Bill. Blair and I are OK, but we don't know who else is caught. -All right, let's go. -We'll have to find the others. -Pat, I'm going to try and raise Rusty. Rusty come in, do you copy? -You all right? -Yes. -Peter? Peter! I can't see Peter, I've got to find Peter. -I'll grab the others, we're on our way. -Here you go, I'll catch up. -Peter! [music playing] -You coming? It's too late to save anyone now. But if we're going down we'll need fluid to keep functioning. [music playing] -Peter. Peter! [shouting] -Pasang, Pasang! -Peter? Peter? [music playing] -Get it out, get it out. [coughing] -You OK? -I'm OK. -Man. -I'm cold. One, two, three. -Is he breathing? -No. -How many do you have under? -This is Roger, over. We've found Pasang. Two buried, we think. Listen, Peter's in bad shape. I'm going to take him down to base camp, over. [music playing] -We're here. Stay with us, stay with us. Stay with us, come on. Come on. What are your orders, Commandant? -We'll-- -He's gone. All three are gone. The mountain has taken them. -What happened to the radio weather checks, Bill? What happened to the radio weather checks, Bill? You should have stopped the goddamn carries. Goddamn you, you bastard. -Come on man, it's no good here. Let's take Pasang down. [music playing] -They trusted us, they trusted all of us. They were on the mountain for us. Now they're dead. -Bloody right they are, because there shouldn't have been any carries. It would have saved three lives. -It's not that simple, Roger. -It is that simple. -OK, yes, the sherpas will follow you into hell if you ask them, but they know the risks-- -March has no right to ask them to walk into an avalanche. -That avalanche wasn't from a couple of hours of snow, it had been building for weeks. -Radio checks. -Half the side of a mountain came down on us! -It is procedure! -Come on, man. No one could have seen this coming. -So what do we do now? -We go on. [overlapping news reports] -Ladies and gentlemen, it's been confirmed that three climbers are dead. -Now we get a story. -Will the expedition continue? -I believe so. -With Bill March in charge? -You'll have a full statement later today. [reporters asking questions] [music playing] [speaking foreign language] -We're heading up. -OK. -All right lads, weather at Camp 1 is clear. Now, we're to travel in small groups. Spread out and do radio checks every half on the ice fall. You're carrying primarily oxygen tanks. Get enough of them up there and we summit. Let's go. [wind howling] -The sponsors will be OK, they'd be crazy to pull out now. You all right? -I think The Goddess is asleep. -Then let's just do what we have to do with her, and not wake her up. -Just like my wife. [birds cawing] [music playing] -What is it? [avalanche] -That didn't sound good. [music playing] -Dammit. [music playing] [gasping] -Get off of me! -Rusty! Rusty! -Dave? -Rusty! Rusty, help. -You're alive! -Yeah, yeah. Throw us your rope. [grunting] -Hurry. -Here. [ice shifting] -Holy crap. Thanks man. Where's Blair? Rusty, where's Blair? -He's up there. [music playing] -Oh. Oh Blair. I'm so sorry, man. -Base camp this is Rusty. BASE CAMP (ON RADIO): We copy Rusty, what happened? Are you all right? -Yeah, I'm OK. Blair didn't make it. -Repeat please. RUSTY (ON RADIO): Blair's dead. I repeat, Blair's dead. -Crushed. [music playing] I'm going to help dig out his body. [music playing] This ice fall is really unstable. BASE CAMP (ON RADIO): Then for the safety of the climbers you should all come back down. Do you copy? Get off the mountain now. -Oh, yeah all right. Copy that. Let's go. Dave we got to go. Come on. -Oh my God. We have to get back. We have to get to a radio. Bill, come on. We've got to get back there. -First time we stick our noses back in there and bam. -Ordered back too soon. Should have waited. -There was no way to know. -It was just bad karma. -Don't start with the karma shit. -It's as if she was just waiting for is. -Why Blair? -There is no why, it's just a mountain you idiots. -What the hell is wrong with you, Paxton? -You're a jinx, Paxton. -Everest base camp, Everest base camp come in, March here. BASE CAMP (ON RADIO): Uh yeah base camp here Bill, go ahead. -Give me a report. -The guys are gearing up to go and get Blair. BILL (ON RADIO): No, listen carefully. I don't want anyone going into the ice fall. Do you read? -Yeah we read Bill. But it seems stable now. -I repeat, no one is to go into the ice fall. Leave Blair where he is. -No way. -Screw him. -Bill the feeling here is very strong. -We can't lose any more lives. -That son of a bitch. He'd leave him up there. -The feeling here is that the body must be recovered now. We want to bring him down. -Maybe it's what they need, to put Blair to rest. -I'm not going to risk anymore lives. Peter. -We're here, Bill. BILL (ON RADIO): This is an order. Under no circumstances is anyone to go into the ice fall. Blair is to be left where he is. I'll be back in camp tomorrow, the climb will then continue. March over and out. -Over and out. -Let's go get Blair. [music playing] -On three. One, two, three. [music playing] -And wither I go you know, and the way you know. I am the way, the truth, and the life. [music playing] -This is a page from Blair's diary. I don't want to die. But if the pale horse should decide to come along there isn't a better cathedral than these mountains to stay in. [music playing] -Bringing down the body was a risk to other lives. -We don't leave our friends behind Bill. Are you capable of understanding that, or were you born without emotions, too? -We cannot let sentiment get in our way. -Or common decency. -Our backs are against the wall. The whole world is watching. This is for real, there's no room for emotion on this mountain. You have to be as hard as it is. -Bill, we all just want to know what's going on. -I'll tell you what's going on. You see that great black pointy thing up there? We're in the process of climbing it. That's what's going on. Is that too hard to understand? -Bill, for God's sake. -We're going to climb it. And we will take all precautions to make sure that no more will die. If they do we must leave them behind and carry on to the top. -What, we're just going to march all over the goddamn dead bodies? -Climbing this mountain is the moral equivalent of a war, so yes, Roger. If that's what it takes we march over the bodies. -You go to war with this mountain Bill, you're going to lose. -You can accept my decisions or you can leave. -Oh yeah? All right. We move to plan B. This is my permit, my idea. It was John's and Laurie's, and mine, and we've been pushed aside. Well no more. I've had enough of this asshole. I'm willing to take over as leader. So what do you say, you with me? Russ, huh? Dave? Eric? Come on you guys. Let's get this goddamn thing back on track. -Let's put it to a vote. It is a democracy that you've been after, isn't it, Roger? -You're serious? -Yes, I'm serious. -All right. All those who want me to take over as leader, raise your hands. Go. [music playing] -Now in favor of my continuing as leader of this expedition. [music playing] -Hey. Laurie. What are you doing man? -Roger I want you out of base camp by day break. -Why don't you just shut it, Bill. -This joker doesn't know what he's doing. He's going to kill you. And you, hey you, son of a bitch. All you want to do is summit, that's all you care about. You know what? You're all sons of bitches. Traitors! You can't even look at me, Russ? Huh? Happy, John? All right, OK. [music playing] -Bill? Uh not to add to all the-- I've had two close misses. That's enough for me. I don't want to tempt fate any farther. But I wish you well, she's a beautiful mountain. -Thanks for all your hard work Rusty. You'll be missed. -You're going? -Yeah, I'm going. Well let's hook up again. And we'll try something safe, like lion taming or alligator wrestling. -Alligator wrestling? You should meet my ex-wife. [music playing] -So March, I wish to speak. -Yes of course, what is it? -We have been talking. No one remembers Chomolungma this dangerous. My sherpas do not want to go up. -Listen, we had an agreement. You're going to shut down the expedition. -I'm sorry. [music playing] -What do we do? -I don't know. [music playing] -Professional Climber says that the judgment of the leadership was compromised by altitude. -That bastard. -Do you agree Mr. Marsh? Roger Marshall is also critical of the leadership. Skyler says that the sherpas were given the most dangerous work leading the way. -Dave, Dave, Dave. -Bill what is it? -He's from the Board. Don't want to embarrass the sponsors, so they want us to come home. -So Mr. March, do you, do you deny these accusations? -Feeling a little lightheaded, Mr. Norwood? -Is the expedition finished? Are you going home? -All right guys, come on. Let's get him back in the chopper. -Quickly, before he has a stroke. -Somebody get the cameraman. -Man we're being dumped on. -We've lost the sherpas. None of our supplies above the ice fall. The press is calling us cowards, and the Board's telling us to come home. -Well then I think maybe to preserve some dignity for the team we should call it. -I guess that's it then. -I'd appreciate it if everyone stuck around and helped Peter dismantle the camp. We can take some of the equipment and sell it in Kat. And then at least we can give something back to-- -Are you all out of your bloody minds? A valid permit. Most of the equipment we need, in place. Enough time before winter. I know 100 climbers who'd give their left testicle to be where we are right now, and you're walking away from it? -We owe a lot to the sponsors Eric, we don't want to embarrass them. -I know about the sponsors. The sponsors. All right. Suit yourselves, but I'll tell you one thing right now, that mountain's going to be climbed. The minute you leave this camp I'm going up. -You can't, Eric. -Who's going to stop me? -Guys. Eric's right. This is exactly what we wanted from the start, travel light. We're a small team now, less gear. We can move faster, react faster, take what's on our backs and keep going. -You heard what the sherpas said, the mountains too unstable this year. We withdraw now, we withdraw with dignity. -We have a chance at this John. -There's almost enough food and oxygen at Camp 1. We go from there. If we're careful with the oxygen we could make it. -We can't do this. -Yeah, we can. -All the way. -Then we go home with dignity. -What do you say Eric, you mind if we join you? -Bloody lonely up there by myself. -All right, let's do it. No more supply runs through the ice fall. We just take what we need. We'll move the upper route East, stay on the south side of the Western Cwm, just below Nuptse. What do you think? -I think that's the first time you've asked us that Bill. -What about the sherpas. -If you get new blessing, it is like new expedition. But don't use priest from Tambotse, use priest from Karatasa. -Just a second. [music playing] [applause] All right, I'll head back to Kat, I'll deal with the sponsors and try to feed the press. -Gentlemen, this is for John Lauchlan, Blair Griffith, Ang Sultan, and Pasang Sola. Let's do it. [music playing] -Good luck guys! [music playing] -You all right you? -You sure? You went down hard. -Yeah I'm good. Let's get up. [wind howling] -Let's go. -Everyone has to be 100% Bill, or they're a liability. -Take the top. -Bill, come on. -Take the rope. [music playing] John. Come on, throw the rope. Throw the rope, Laurie. [music playing] -Dammit! -I'm sorry Laurie. -Bill, please. -Make sure he gets back to base camp. Take care. -I'll break trail. [music playing] -We have enough supplies now at Camp 1 for a single push. Do we need to keep the ice fall open any more? -No. -It won't be passable in a couple of days. It's our escape route. -We don't want to escape. We want everything focused on going up. -Three broken ribs. You need several weeks rest. -Weeks? -You won't be climbing again this year. The Goddess has freed you. [nature sounds] [music playing] -Of all the gin joints in all the world, huh? Hey Dana, Mary! Hey. -Laurie! -Hi, Laurie. -I'm so sorry. [music playing] -I'm beginning to understand the oneness with the mountain that the Buddhists speak about. We are all of one universe. Complete. [music playing] -Welcome. Just a little avalanche. -Good to see you. -You too. I'm sorry, Dana. -Hey Laurie, they're at Camp 2. -Really? -Waiting for the weather to change. -That's fantastic. -Bill closed the ice fall. -What? -No one goes through. -He closed it. [music playing] -You sure about this? -Yeah. [music playing] -Good luck. Be safe. -Don't have to worry. -I'll call Bill after you're gone. -Thanks Peter. Thanks for everything. -Better hurry, sun's getting up there. [music playing] BASE CAMP (ON RADIO): Camp 3, Camp 3 this is base camp, come in Bill. -Go ahead Peter. -Uh yeah Bill, Laurie's on his way up. -What? No way. -Bloody fool. -We've got to stop him. It'll be completely impassable, especially with those ribs of his. -Well he's already gone, he's pretty determined. -Well he's not going to get very far. BILL (ON RADIO): Does he have a radio? BASE CAMP (ON RADIO): Uh that's a negative. BILL (ON RADIO): Well call me if he gets back. BASE CAMP (ON RADIO): Roger that. -He'll never get through alone. [music playing] BILL (ON RADIO): Bill here Peter, any idea where he is? -He's still in there. -Goddammit. We'll have send men down. Standby the radio Peter. BASE CAMP (ON RADIO): Will do. [music playing] -Buddhist, Muslim, Jew, Ba'hai, anything you want, just let me in. Just let me in my Goddess. [music playing] -About to head down now Bill. -Let me know when you make contact with that idiot. -Roger that. -Hey guys. What's up? -Hang on a second Bill, he's right here. BILL (ON RADIO): Is he OK? BILL (ON RADIO): KIWI (ON RADIO): Yeah, he's all right. He made it. He seems to be intact. BILL (ON RADIO): Put him on the radio. LAURIE (ON RADIO): Hey Bill it's Laurie here. -You crazy bastard, what the hell do you think you were doing? -Well if you're fit enough to come solo through the ice fall, you can get your sorry butt up here. We could use some help. -Roger that, Bill. [music playing] -Liquids only from here on up. -My fingers are all swollen. -The same thing's happening in your brain. -My eyes can't focus. -The hallucinations should be starting soon. -Well aren't you a cheery fellow. -Maybe we should go down for a rest? -We go down now, we'll never come back up. -The storm will blow over in a few days, then we'll try again. -Lovely. More days of Eric's fun facts about altitude. -What was that? -Ice. Breaking off the Lhotse summit. It comes down like buzz saws. you don't want to go out there. -Ah, what's going on? I thought this was over? Isn't the team coming back? -They changed their minds. They're going for it. -I'm supposed to be in base camp if they summit. We paid for the right to cover this thing. I'm not being properly informed! -Kelly, go to hell. [wind howling] [labored breathing] -Woo. Oh man. South Col. Never believed I'd make it. World's highest dump. Look at that view. [wind howling] -No oxygen. -It's frozen up. -Come in Bill. BILL (ON RADIO): Bill here, Eric. Where are you? -We're at the South Col. BILL (ON RADIO): Congratulations! -Only one's missing are Dave and Kiwi. They're coming up behind us. -OK listen, the weather reports are spotty for the next two days. It's hard to say what you're going to get. Just keep your fingers crossed and go for it before dawn. Who are your two strongest climbers? BILL (ON RADIO): How's Pat doing? -Not a good bet. His inexperience at altitude is clearly showing. He shouldn't even be up this high. I guess he's getting some good pictures for the sponsors. BILL (ON RADIO): What about Laurie? -No better with those broken ribs of his. Kiwi or Dave would be a better choice. If you're sure you really need a second man. -All right, maybe not. Let's see what shape Kiwi and Dave are in. Call me when they get there. You take care. BILL (ON RADIO): You might be our only bet. -Will do. Over and out. [music playing] -Look! They left two tanks! -That means there's not going to be enough oxygen at the top for the both of us to spend the night. [wind howling] -I'll go down. -Are you sure? Sorry man. -Best of luck. [music playing] I'm going back to 3. G'day. -There's still no sign of them. BILL (ON RADIO): OK. I think we have to organize a search party. -I think that's premature, Bill. At this altitude it will cost us strength, and it will cost oxygen. BILL (ON RADIO): We don't have a choice. -I think we should give them another hour. -No way, it's getting late. There's a storm coming in. They're not going to survive a night out on the mountain. I want the search party to head down ASAP. Over and out. -This will cost us the summit. -Dave, do you read? Dave, can you hear me? -Dave is here! -Dave! Dave! Dave, are you all right? -I'm OK. -You made it man, we were worried. -Come in Bill. BILL (ON RADIO): Bill here. Did Dave show up? -Yeah. Listen, we better talk about the summit team. We don't have Dave or Kiwi. I say just two sherpas and me. -You bastard. BILL (ON RADIO): What about Laurie? -Well it's the rib problem Bill. We get up there, he gets into trouble, I'll have to bring him down. He's a bad risk. -You son of a bitch. -Let me talk to Laurie. -It'd be a mistake. -Give the radio to Laurie. -Eric, give the radio to Laurie. -Bill it's Laurie here. -Laurie, are you ready for this? -Yeah I'm good, it's not a problem. Let me go. -OK, you're on. There's enough oxygen for four. BILL (ON RADIO): I want two climbers and two sherpas. The summit team will be Sandaya, Lhakpa Shang, Eric, and Laurie. -Bloody hell. -Over and out Bill. Thank you. [wind howling] -You know we don't really need two summiteers. -That's what this is all about, isn't it? You just want to stand up there by yourself. -It's called the death zone for a reason. You're on your own. Anything goes wrong, no one can help you. You'll die. You were never as good as John Lauchlan. He should be standing here, not you. I would say that this is you, this is your fault. You did leave him on the mountain alone, didn't you? -You bastard. -You see? You're not ready. You don't deserve it. Laurie, I think you should withdraw, don't you? [music playing] -This is my tent now. Lhakpa's in with Dave. -This storm keeps up, there won't be a summit bid. -Give me some of that tea. -No, this my tea. I make more for you later. -Just give me half. -I'll trade for half your chocolate bar. -No. It's the second to last one. -Not wash in long time. -You don't exactly smell like a bucket of roses yourself. [deep rumbling] -What the hell is this? -That is an oxygen bottle there. I found it. It's almost full. I'm going to go up as high as I can, maybe even get up to the Hillary Step and take a couple pictures of your ugly mug. -You're joking. -I need a couple of shots of the team heading up to the summit. You can't stop me. -Jesus. Save me from amateurs. Just don't get in my way. -Let's get to it. -Have a nice day! -Camp 4, what's your status? Are you guys ready? -We're just going to head out now Bill. -OK Eric, Laurie, I want you to take it nice and easy. BILL (ON RADIO): Don't rush. Don't want to lose anyone when we're this close. And good luck. -Good luck! -They copied that Bill and Peter. But Bill, have you got girls down there, over? Because there weren't any girls down at base camp when I was down there. Over. -Dave, stay focused. -OK, OK but on that later, all right? Over. Now remember, just as many people die coming down Everest as do going up. Getting to the summit is optional. Getting back down, that is compulsory. Rock on! -Rock on. [music playing] BILL (ON RADIO): Kathmandu this is base camp. MALE VOICE (ON RADIO): Come in, over. -This is Kathmandu, John here. What's going on Peter? PETER (ON RADIO): A team of Eric, Laurie, and sherpas this Sundaray and Lhakpa are headed for the summit. [cheering] -Guts and glory, man. -I don't care how, I just need an airplane, a chopper, to take me to base camp now. $5,000 US, if you can get me-- $7,000. This isn't working. REPORTER (ON TV): After two tragic starts, these intrepid climbers are once again going to the top. [wind howling] -Get off, you bastard! -What's wrong, Eric? [gasping] -Oxygen. -Maybe your tank's frozen. [gasping] -I need oxygen. -Take mine. -No. You've earned it. All right. I need it, I need oxygen. -Finders keepers. -I'm all right. Good luck. Good luck. [music playing] -What are you waiting for? -I'm not supposed to go any further? -Says who? -What the hell, eh? [music playing] -Oh this is fantastic. -Ladies and gentlemen, guess where we are? LAURIE (ON RADIO): We made it! [cheering and applause] -5 hours, 47 minutes, from the South Col to the summit. -Kathmandu, Kathmandu this is base camp. They made it. [applause] -Laurie, you son of a bitch. Guts and glory man, guts and glory. -It's the most incredible view. -Congratulations you bums! -Laurie, Eric here. What's it look like? LAURIE (ON RADIO): About what you'd expect Eric. -A big patch of snow, nothing left to climb. LAURIE (ON RADIO): Is Bill there? -Yeah, Laurie, Bill here. -Bill, thank you for this. -No problem. -Hey Dave! It's on the other side! -What is? -The beach! -And Dave! It's topless. -I knew it! I'm on my way! -Will you idiots be serious? Take your pictures and get out of there. [music playing] -Let's go down now man, I'm starting to feel it. -Yeah, me too. [music playing] Goodbye John. [music playing] [helicopter] -There's a press conference at 2 o'clock in Kat. Then we'll celebrate. -You can totally sell your underwear for a fortune now man. -You've totally got to give it back to me then. -It took all of us. We'll make sure to them that. -Yeah, it's not feeding the starving or bringing world peace, but it's worth it, huh? See you guys. Namaste. -Namaste. You deserve it Laurie. -Bill, Kiwi. -You're on the Canadian expedition then? -I am. -You made it! Good on ya! [music playing] -Namaste. -Namaste. [music playing] [crying] -Let's go. [music playing] -See ya! -Namaste! [music playing] [music playing] [music playing]
