There's a black hole in my house And I don't know what to do. I don't know where it came from. I don't know why it's here. All I know is that it's certainly a black hole. How do I know? "Kitty?" Well... "Kitty" it looks the same from every single direction. And two it ate my cat. At first I- I thought it was nothing. But I got a second opinion. "I don't know what I'm looking at." I'm gonna touch it, though. So I left it alone. That's not to say I didn't find any use for it, however. I found ways of using the black hole in my favor. But after a while. As it had eaten my cat and eaten my friend, it too began to eat at me. So I decided to try and ignore the black hole like a piece of furniture or a painting on the wall. No matter what I did. No matter where I was. It was always there. Eating. Eating at the back of my mind, 'Til, one day... something wasn't right. I knew that it had taken over my every thought, my every waking moment ringing in the back of my mind. every single instance of each day gnawing at me. I had to get out of there. But when I left. I felt I had missed something. A day, some time, some space. I couldn't quite put my finger on it. And then it hit me. I was already in it. I tried to run, but something but something was keeping me from moving. Like mud or quicksand. Like running in a nightmare. I tried to yell for help. But just like that, I was gone. Time slipping through the lens. Fast forwarding, like videotape. Every person I'd ever loved, every discovery I would have made, every human emotion I would have experienced, Everything I thought was important came and went, lost to time and space. And so was I. And then I was alone. Utterly and irrevocably alone. Lost gone Swallowed up by that contemptuous black hole. It was then a miracle happened. I saw the universe Time and life, and the whole of everything flip like a book in front of me. Witnessing the beauty of every sunset, every turn of the earth waxing and waning before me birth existence death consciously evolving before my eyes. I should've felt lucky. But I just felt lonely. And that loneliness hurt The black hole and I had become one. A singularity. Everything crashing in on itself, compounded by time. Was this it? Was just my new reality? Would I be okay with that? And if I was, what could of it? Enlightenment? Sadness? Is there something philosophical in the exploration of man and his exceptional loneliness? Like a Tibetan monk on a mountainside figuring out all the world's-- "Pspsps" "Pspspspspsps" "Aw hey" "The hell?" "Oh, my God." "Oh, my God."
