I am actress Milla Jovovich, and I will be portraying Dr. Abigail Tyler in The Fourth Kind. This film is a dramatization of events that occurred October 1 st through the 9th of 2000, in the northern Alaskan town of Nome. To better explain the events of the story, the director has included actual archived footage throughout the film. This footage was acquired from Nome psychologist Dr. Abigail Tyler, who has personally documented over 65 hours of video and audio materials during the time of the incidents. To better protect their privacy, we have changed the names and professions of many of the people involved. Every dramatized scene in this movie is supported by either archived audio, video, or as it was related by Dr. Tyler during extensive interviews with the director. In the end, what you believe is yours to decide. Please be advised that some of what you are about to see is extremely disturbing. OSUNSANMl: Just relax, and I'll ask you questions, and whenever, whatever you want to toss in there. Okay. You all right? Okay. I'm going to try and make this as painless as possible. Can you state your name for the camera? Dr. Abigail Emily Tyler. Okay, where would you like to begin? I guess... After what happened with will, my husband, I... I went to my friend, who is also a psychologist, Dr... (INAU DIBLE) because I was having trouble dealing with how he... with how it happened and who did it. REAL ABEL ON RECORDING: You don't think you might need more time? REAL ABBEY ON RECORDING: No, this is something... I have to do this. I have to remember his face. I need it for myself to heal. I have to try, and I have to know that, for my children, that I did everything that I could to remember. ...to remember. You know, since that night, Ashley still can't see, and I don't think that she's gonna get her sight back if she doesn't accept what happened. (SIGH ING) Well, I think you both have the same problem, just different symptoms. Yeah, and I think that it could help if I could just remember the face of that man, so we could somehow track him down and set the record straight and find some closure. All right. All right. Do you want it on video? Yeah. Counseling a fellow psychologist is like... It's like talking to myself. You always say that. ABEL: I do? Oh, my God. All right. I guess just try to relax and get yourself comfortable. Listen to the sound of my voice as I count back. (EXHALES DEEPLY) Ten... REAL ABEL: Nine... Eight, seven, six... Your eyes are getting heavier... ...and heavier. Five, four. They're almost closed. They're almost closed. Three, two and one. ...one. Very good, Abbey. Very good. Let's go back in time... Let's go back in time... ...back into the past... ...back into the past... ...to the night of August 2nd of this year. ...to the night of August 2nd of this year. What was the weather like? Warm. Warmer than usual, even though it's raining outside. Okay, good. Now, let's go back to when you were with Will, just before the intruder entered your room. We're making love. It's nice. It's so... It's so nice. He's falling asleep. Mmm. Good. So what happens... What happened next? I'm awake. I'm wide awake, and we're just lying here. What woke you up? (SIGHS) (GROAN ING) (SCREAMING) Oh, God! Someone stabbed him in the chest! Oh, my God! Blood everywhere. There's blood everywhere. ABEL: Try to see his face. Try to see his face. I can't see it. My husband! It just feels like I can't move. I can't see it. It feels like we're frozen. I can't see it. Abbey. Abbey, Abbey, Abbey, Abbey. Abbey. It's all over me! All over me. Focus on my voice. Focus on my voice. You will be awakened and conscious in five, four, three, two, one. (GASPS) Abbey. Here. Let me. If I could just see his face. He was killed, and I was right there, Abel. I was right there. Yeah, you know, it's as natural to feel guilt as it is unnatural to feel it was your fault. You know that. Yeah, okay. Okay. I think you might want to consider taking some time off. Real time, you know? Because it just might help you find clarity with what happened. I have to continue this study. It meant a lot to Will, and he would have wanted me to continue. Now, why did I know you were gonna say that? He would have wanted me to try and finish it as soon as I could. It meant a lot to him. OSUNSANMl: And how long had it been at this point since Will had passed away? REAL ABBEY: Two months. And you guys were already back to school, and the kids were already back to school? I had to try and get some normality back into life. I didn't know what else to do. Is Nome a place you can drive into or... No, you have to fly around. Okay. You can't get there by road. Any messages? No, but Scott's waiting in your office, and you have a 1:00 and a 2:00. Thank you. So, how was it coming in? It was a little bumpy. You'd think as beautiful as that sky is that it wouldn't be so rough. The stuff that really shakes us... We seldom ever see coming. I know, I know. It's a good saying. Not every week. Hi, Scott. Sorry I'm late. SCOTT: (GRU NTS) Hey, Dr. Tyler. I flew up to Anchorage this morning, so I'm having a bit of a slow start. Please, sit down and make yourself comfortable. How are you? I'm all right. Have you been sleeping? It's... It's worse. I wake up in the middle of the night almost every night, and I just lie there. What time does this normally occur? Around 2:30, 3:00 in the morning. And there's nothing unusual waking you up? No, nothing. It's just there's... There's one thing. There's an owl at my window. An owl? A white owl. It was just looking at me. How long was it there? Hours. No matter what I did, it wouldn't fly away. It wasn't scared of me. What was it doing? Just staring at me. (SIGH ING) Had you ever seen it before? TOMMY: Yeah. Once when I was a kid. That was the first time? Uh-huh. I guess I've seen it a lot. How much is a lot? Every night this week. Every night? You mean every time you go to bed? I think it came inside. Was your window open? No. I wonder how it got in. I don't know, but I remember it looking down at me. Over your bed? Yeah, I think so. I... It's really hard to remember. It's almost like... Like it didn't happen. Like, you know, in a dream. Like I just dreamt it. Can you come see me tomorrow? Sure, if you think I should, or if it's important. Yeah, I do. I do think it's important, and it's nothing to be alarmed at, at all, but there have been some strange coincidences here, and I just... I feel like I need to try something new. What do you mean? You're not the first patient I've had who's experienced something like this. REAL ABBEY: I felt so sorry for my baby, and I feel responsible. Can you just knock it off? Conversion disorder is not a phenomenon that a lot of people understand, and we've had to make quite an adjustment. OSUNSANMl: when did Ashley go blind? After what happened to will, she just lost her sight. (IMITATING BIRD CALLING) Hey, baby. Hi, Mommy. How was rehearsal for the play? Hey, what's wrong? Nothing. Come on. Come on, cough it up. What happened? Ralph called me a faker. What? A faker? He said that I could see before, and now I was just pretending. What a jerk. He said that I just wanted everybody to feel sorry for me because of Daddy. Dear Lord, thank you for everything we have. Please continue to bless our family, and please continue to help Ashley overcome her challenges, and help all of us to heal. In Jesus' name we pray. Amen. ASH LEY: Amen. Hey, what time is the game tomorrow? 7:00. And who are you playing again? I already told you, Browerville. Well, I'm sorry, sweetie. I must have forgot. Dad never forgot. (SIGHS) Yeah, and Dad's not here anymore. No, he's not. Can you accept it yet? Okay, Ronnie, not in front of your sister, okay? We'll talk about it later. What do you mean? Nothing, honey. How Dad died. All right, Ronnie. What is wrong with you? You go around helping other people with their problems... Stop it. Stop it! ...but you can't even help yourself. What the hell is that supposed to mean? Ronnie. Mommy? What did... What does he mean? OSUNSANMl: And do you think he, in any way, may have blamed you for Will's death? REAL ABBEY: Yes, he did blame me, and he said that I couldn't help him or Ashley or anyone, and he was right. WILL ON RECORDING: A small number continue to experience debilitating sleep disorders, and this seems to be the trend throughout Nome, and a cause remains unknown. Even during the night months, they can't sleep. We've seen over 300 people throughout Nome who are all exhibiting the same symptoms. Around 3:00 in the morning, they are awakened for no apparent reason, and they wake up apprehensive, frightened, panicked, as if something's about to happen. Whether or not this is related... Daddy? ...to the missing people or disappearances... No, my baby, it's just a recording of Daddy's voice. Come over here. I got you. Come up on the bed. My angel. ABBEY: Okay, you're doing real good, Tommy. When I get to one, you will be asleep, very, very relaxed. Four, three, two and one. Can you hear me? Yes. And when was the last time you had trouble sleeping? Last night. And did you see the owl? Yeah. Good. And what did it look like? REAL ABBEY ON VIDEO: ...what did it look like? Tommy? I... I don't remember. You don't remember what the owl looks like? No. No, I don't see the owl. I don't see the owl now. It's not there anymore. It's not there anymore. Did it fly away? REAL ABBEY: Did it fly away? TOMMY: No, I think it's... No, I think it's... I don't really remember it... I don't really remember it... ...ever being there. ...ever being there. There's something outside my door. It's gonna open it. (IN HALES SHARPLY) The door's opening. (DOOR OPENING) Oh, my God. Oh, my God! No. REAL ABBEY: what's wrong? Oh, Jesus! Tommy, what's wrong? No, no, no! No, no! No, no, no! No, no, no! Okay, Tommy, when I count to three, you will awaken. No, no, no! ...to conscious... No! Three! No! No, no! No! Three! No! (REAL TOMMY SCREAMING) Tommy, it's not happening. It's a memory. This is not real. It is real. Did I do that? Yeah, you did, Tommy, but it's okay. It's okay. (SH USH ING) What did you see? Nothing. What? Nothing. You said you saw something. No, I didn't see anything. I didn't see anything. I'm just trying to help you. If you want to help me, get me out of this room. I need to go home. I need to go home. I'm okay. I'm okay. Tommy, are you trying to convince me or you? Did you see what was bothering you at night? Did you see the owl? Can we talk about this next time? Yeah, of course. Sure. Talk to me when you need to. Yeah. Okay. (CALLER SCREAMING) (GUN FIRING) (POLICE SIRENS WAILING) Call in EMTs, Search, everybody. I want everybody. Transfer me into that house. Right now. (PHONE RINGING) Tommy here. Yeah, what's going on in there? I want to talk to Abbey Tyler. Abbey? Abbey's not here right now, but I can help you. I have to talk to her! (SCREAMING) (GASPS) (PHON E RINGING) Hello? AUGUST: I need you down here at Tommy's house. August? He's gone crazy. He's holding his family hostage, and he's asking for you. Okay, I'll be right there. (POLICEMEN CHATTERING) TOMMY ON PHONE: Bring her up here. AUGUST: She's here right now. We'll walk her up to you, okay, Tommy? It's gonna be all right. Just give her the phone. Give her the phone. I want to talk to her. OFFICER: Both arms out. Both arms out. She's here. Put her on the phone right now. I'm gonna do it right now, okay? Is this really necessary? I want to talk to her! Can somebody tell me what's going on? Where is she? Take it easy, all right? I don't see her. Get her up here! August, what's going on? I need you to calm him down and get him thinking rationally. He's got Sarah, Timothy and Joe lined up in the kitchen with a gun to their heads, and he wants to talk to you for some reason, all right? OFFICER: Watch your step. Straight this way. Tommy? Tommy, what... What's going on here? I'm so sorry, but I've gotta do this. I don't have a choice. It was completely surreal to be there in the middle of the night with all those police trucks. I don't have a choice. No, no, no. You have a choice, Tommy. We always have a choice. Not this time. Please, Tommy! Yes. Yes, you do. You have the choice right now to just... To just stop. Just put down the gun, Tommy. You have it within your power to just stop. Please, before somebody gets hurt. Tommy, look at Sarah, Tommy. Look at... Look at your wife. Look at your children, Tommy. It's okay. It's okay. You would never let anything happen to them. You love them so much. I know what keeps us up at night. And if you saw what I saw, you would understand. What did you see, Tommy? It doesn't matter, because we're not gonna have to see it ever again. Just wait, Tommy. I can help you. Just talk to me, okay? We'll talk as long as you need to. We'll get through this, Tommy. If anybody's got a clear shot, take it now. RYAN: Negative. GREGORY: I don't have a clear shot, sir. The wife is blocking him. And he wasn't listening to me. Do you know what Zimabu Eter means? And they were going to kill him. What? Wait. I can't hear you, Tommy. What? Has anybody got the shot? Zimabu Eter! Zimabu Eter! Zimabu Eter! What the hell does that mean? Zimabu Eter? I don't know, Tommy. What the hell does that mean? Anybody got the goddamn shot? But I can find out. Just give me a little time. I need to know now! Just give me a little time. I will find out for you. I promise. Right now! No, please! You can't help me. I love you. (GUN FIRES) REAL AUGUST: Move, move! Move, move, move! Tommy! God damn it! REAL AUGUST ON RECORDING: I'm having a hard time understanding what happened here. REAL ABBEY: I know. I know. You don't know what he saw? REAL AUGUST: So you have no idea what he saw? REAL ABBEY: He didn't tell me. He didn't tell me. What did he tell you? That what he thought he saw wasn't an owl. That it was something else. And that's what was keeping him up at night? Yeah. So he was under hypnosis when he saw this? Yeah. And how do you know what he saw was real? I don't know that it was. So what you're saying is that Tommy might have done all of this based on something that was imaginary. (SIGHS) All I know is that he believed what he saw, and there was more fear in his eyes than I've ever seen in my life. Had you not hypnotized him, do you think he would have done this? What do you mean? I'm just wondering, without this hypnotism, do you think he still would have murdered his family? That is a ridiculous and offensive question. No, what's ridiculous and offensive is that an entire family is lying in a morgue from a murder-suicide, and the last meaningful contact that the murderer had was with you. No, what happened tonight would have manifested itself eventually. He was suppressing something. Look, in 13 years of practice, I've never witnessed something to this extent. Abbey, why didn't you contact us if you suspected he was unstable after an admittedly violent episode? He was completely coherent when he left my office. Now, I had no reason to suspect... I called his wife to ask her to keep an eye on him. And now she's dead. Okay, I'm not going to sit here and listen to how hypnosis-induced murder caused this. Jesus, I am trying to find out... This is ridiculous. ...what caused one of the worst murders in the history of Nome. There's something going on in this town that we don't understand. There's something happening to people in their sleep... Well, I don't know about any of that! I don't understand what you're talking about! I don't deal in hallucinations. I don't deal in the visions in the ether. What in the hell are you talking about? I'm dealing in real flesh and blood things, four of whom are lying on slabs next door. How dare you? My husband was lying on one of those slabs and you still haven't found his killer. Abbey, now, you know damn well what happened to Will. That case is closed. No, you cannot file things away without getting to what really happened. Now, there are more unsolved murders and missing people in Nome... Sit down. ...than any other town in Alaska, three years of which have been under your watch. Now, what is happening in this town is very real, and it must be acknowledged. Sit down! You stop whatever this governmental study is, this hypnosis, whatever it is, whatever you and Will were after. It's bringing nothing but bad news to a town that's had enough. Now, I don't care how important it is to you. I don't care how hard you've worked on it. I don't care. You're not gonna use the people of Nome for a goddamn rat study. I felt responsible for... ...death, and his family's. And at the time, after all that happened, I still didn't know why he did it. All of the patients reported seeing the same owl, but Tommy mentioned that his memory of the owl was wrong and that he didn't see it anymore. It was some sort of false recollection. The question is, if under hypnosis, will the others feel the same way? Will they see what he saw? We have to proceed with extreme caution. What happened here remains unexplained, like Will. Abel? I heard what happened. I just wanted to make sure you were okay. Hey. You flew all the way up here? That's all right. That's okay. I'm worried about you. You didn't have to. I'm fine. Yeah? Yeah. You want to talk? I can't. I can't cancel my schedule. Theresa, good morning. Can you transcribe this for me, please? Do you want me to cancel your meetings? No, no. Thank you. So, how you feeling? I feel like I just need to start my day. Yeah. Maybe it's... You think it's time that you, maybe, stepped back? Maybe consider it a sabbatical? I love that word. It doesn't actually sound like what it means, which is "time off." Abbey, listen, you need to step away for perspective, clarity on what's happened. I mean, you can't continue like this. No, I can, and I have to. It's the only thing I have within my power. It's all I have left, is to continue, to find out what's causing all of this. I can't... I don't... I don't believe that it can be just chalked up to coincidence, what happened to Will, what happened to Tommy and his family. I don't. (SIGHS) Not in this town. Do you mind if I stay on a bit? Just kept an eye on you, since you're not too keen on doing it yourself? It's all right. (EXHALES) So, lots to talk about. What happened to Tommy? I can't discuss... He's dead. You should be able to discuss everything. It had something... I believe that it had something to do with his sleeping habits. We're really worried, obviously. It's the second suicide in a couple of months. I understand. We want you to hypnotize me, too. We need to know if there's anything I'm not remembering, and I feel... We feel like the best thing to do is to face it. We've already thought it over. If you want to undergo this, we're gonna have to go about this very delicately. Would it be all right if a colleague of mine, Dr. Campos, came in to observe? Yeah, sure. Okay. ABBEY: Five. Deeper, deeper. You're totally relaxed. Four, three, two and one. So, when was the last time you had trouble sleeping? Last night. And do you remember seeing anything unusual last night? An owl. ABBEY: Tell me about the owl. REAL ABBEY: Tell me about the owl. It's a beige owl. Its eyes are big, like... I don't know. It doesn't look like a normal owl. It doesn't look like a normal owl. (IN HALES SHARPLY) (BREATH ING H EAVILY) Scott? There is no owl. It's not... Honey, honey, honey, wake up. You hear that? wake up. She's not... She's not waking up. Someone's outside the door. Tell me what you see. Something's out there. Can you see who it is? Not who, what. I know what they are. They come all the time since I was little. What are they? (DOORKNOB RATTLING) (WH IMPERING) They're gonna open the door. They get in without setting off the alarm. I armed it. I know... I know I did. I thought they only come when I think about them, but I wasn't thinking about them tonight. (GURGLING) (GU RGLING) Okay, Scott, I'm gonna count to three, and you're gonna wake up. One, two, three! Scott! Scott! Scott, wake up! (GASPS) (REAL SCOTT COUGHING) Here you go. Go ahead. I'm sorry. It's unbelievable. It doesn't make any sense. Scott, you don't have to rush. Whenever you're ready, you can tell us what you saw. I saw them. Who's them? They're not from here. What do you mean? I can't describe it. I can't see what's in my own mind. I can't control it. All I can see is the owl, but I... I know it's not an owl, but I... I remember the smell, like a... Like a putrid cinnamon. Do you understand what I'm saying? The worst part was the voice inside my head, like... 'Cause they talk to you so you can hear them, but... They also talk inside your mind, like you're connected or something. And they take me away to somewhere, but I can't remember, and I can't remember what they do to me. Okay, okay, Scott, that's enough for today. I'm so sorry. It's gonna be all right. Cindy, under the circumstances, I'm going to contact Sheriff August to let him know that we've met and let him know that we've had this session. Yeah, please do. Okay. Now, I know why... did what he did. Why? You'd have to have seen it, felt it, what it is. What is it? The worst. Of what? That you could... You could ever imagine. Come on. Babe, let's go home. We're going home. What the hell was that? Abel. Hmm? Do you believe in abduction theories? What do you mean, like kidnappings? Yeah. No. No, not... (EXCLAIMS) Not kidnappings, but abduction, as in... You don't mean alien abductions, do you? Well, you know, I think that might be what we just heard. When you look at the statistics, they're pretty impressive. I mean, Will was kind of into that, and he did a little research. You know, there are over 11 million people that have either reported seeing or know someone who has seen U FOs since the 1930s. The idea of any of this stuff being real is... You can't... Come on, Abel. I mean, when something boasts 11 million witnesses... You know, that would win any court case in the world. Well, and there are just as many explanations and reasons. Weather balloons, atmospheric effects, optical illusions. In this case, perhaps, hypnocognic hallucinations. Listen, we have to deal with hard, empirical evidence and facts. We can't... (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Abbey! Abbey. The tape. The tape you gave me this morning... Wait. Slow down. Slow down, Theresa. What is it? Did you listen to it? I don't... I don't know what this is. I don't know what's going on. I don't want to listen to it again. (ABBEY ON RECORDING) That was weird. (HEAVY BREATHING) (DOOR CREAKING) (ABBEY GROANING) (SCREAMING) Abbey? (SCREAMING CONTINUES) (GARBLED SPEECH) (RECORDING ENDS) That's you? That's not my voice. (BREATH ING H EAVILY) That's not me. OSUNSANMl: After you heard that, what did you, like... How did you react? After the initial shock, I was in denial. It couldn't be me, my voice. So, what happened next? I went through what I could hold onto. Which were what? Which were the facts. I went home to try and recount what happened during the recording. (GLASS BREAKING) I was sleeping in my bed when my door opened. (DOOR CREAKING) Someone or something came into my room. Did it cause that somehow? Some kind of allergic reaction? How long had it been there? But whatever, whoever it was, I fought it. (ABBEY SCREAMING) But it was too strong, and it took me away. The moment it became too real was when I looked down at the floorboards and I saw scratches leading all the way to the door. I put myself back together. I was determined to figure out what it was, what came into my room, what it was saying, where it took me, and what it did to me. I listened to that tape over and over to figure out anything, something to explain what it was. It wasn't Latin. It wasn't Greek. It wasn't any language that I had heard before, and I felt it was the key to everything that was happening to me, to Will, and everyone else in Nome. And then I found exactly what I was looking for. AWOLOWA: Hello? ABBEY: Hello. Is this Dr... Awolowa Odusami. Yes, this is he. Hi, I was wondering, are you familiar with a person named Dr. William Tyler? No, I'm not. I'm sorry. Okay. May I ask who's speaking? I'm... will you tell me your name? (PHON E RINGING) (EXHALES) Hello? AWOLOWA: Listen, there was a man who called me from this number. He called himself John. There's no John here. Exactly, I know. What was he... Why was he calling you? He wanted to have a history lesson on ancient languages. Look, I... That was my husband that you talked to, and he's been murdered. Dr... AWOLOWA: I'm sorry... I'm sorry to hear that. ...he listened to me. Yeah. He didn't judge me or try to analyze me. I just... I need... He just listened. I need you to hear me out. And then he flew over to Nome. I thought it was Akkadian, but it's not. It's Sumerian. I'm sure of it. This is widely considered by my peers to be the Holy Grail of dead languages, but we haven't deciphered the entire lexicon. (SPEAKING SYLLABLES OF SUMERIAN WORDS) "Our creation" is the last two words. I'm not sure of the first two. "Examine" is the first word. The last word is "ruin" or "destroy." "Our creation," "examine," "ruin," or "destroy." Ruin, destroy who? It's an incomplete translation. We can't be sure of exactly what's being said. But whatever it is, it sounds aggressive. I'm sorry, but none of this is making any sense. It's a verbalized recording of the Sumerian language. Now, we're talking about the oldest language in human history for whatever reason recorded in your room. What was happening? What was being done to me? What is unsettling is that whatever it is, the vocals, they don't sound... Ordinary. Human? Whoa. Whoa, whoa. Stop. Stop. Stop. Okay? Let's not fuel any more of these fires. Now, there's any number of reasons for the distortion in the voice. I'm not jumping to any conclusions, but her voice sounded fine. The tape could have been recorded over, for one, and part of the old tape could still be heard. No, I don't recycle tapes. Well, maybe this time you did. And that still does not explain why that voice is speaking a language that predates Egyptian hieroglyphics. Now, I've studied the Sumerian civilization for most of my career, and what I have found is intriguing. You can go into any Sumerian exhibit and see what I am about to tell you. Drawings of rockets that look like Apollo launching into the sky. Etchings and sculptures of men in spacesuits and what look like oxygen masks. And this artwork was created in the fourth millennium B.C. E., 4,000 years before Christ walked the Earth. "Genesis," Noah's ark, to name a few. Both of these stories existed in Sumer 6,000 years before the Bible was written. "Genesis" came from the Sumerian epic of creation. Noah's ark came from the Sumerian deluge. The alien-god legend has its basis, its origins, in Sumerian history. You can find everything I've described in a museum right now. You know, it is one thing to entertain wild theories, but quite another to invest in them. Yes, and you're entitled to that reaction, but as I said from the beginning, I draw no conclusions. I'm dealing in facts. Now, this is drawn from thousands of years of data research and collection. How this is put together is open to debate. (PHON E RINGING) ABEL: Do you honestly believe you were forcibly removed from your bedroom by members of an alien race? (PHON E CONTIN U ES RINGING) Hello? CINDY: Abbey, can you come over? It's Scott. Something's wrong. He wants you to come over. He... Cindy? Hold on a second. Just take a deep breath. Hi, Cindy. Hey. This is Dr. Odusami. He's here to help. Good morning. Come in. Scott? What took you so long? I'm sorry. I came as quick as I could. Last night was... (SH USH ES) Calm down. Calm down? Scott. How can I? You don't... Scott. Scott, I'm here, all right? Now, you've gotta try and breathe for me. You have to calm yourself, because I cannot help you if you're all wound up. I don't want to talk about it, but I have to. Have to, have to, have to... I have to, I have to, I have to... Scott, why are you... I have to. What is this? How did you get this? I don't know. I didn't know it was there. I just... Okay. Can we set up the camera, please? No, no, no, no, no. I don't need anyone... I don't want this getting out. Scott, we need to record what's happening. We need to record this session for study, so we can find out what's going on with you. Okay, I don't want to go under. Well, we don't have to do that. Just try and relay whatever you remember. There's things I have to remember, but I... But I can't. I can't without... You know what? We can put you under a very light hypnosis. Okay? But if you're worried... I have to. I have to remember. I have to get this out of my head. It feels like it's just dug in there and I can't think straight anymore. (SH USH ING) It's okay. It's okay. I have to... I'll do it. Are you sure? Yeah. Okay. (MUTTERING) Are we ready? Okay. (SCOTT HYPERVENTILATING) It's okay. Okay? (SH USH ING) Relax. Just relax. There's a lot of people in the room with you now. You're not alone. Relax. By the time I reach one, you will be asleep. Five, four, three, two, one. (SCREAMING) Scott? (CINDY SCREAMING) (GASPING) (SCOTT ROARING) (DISTORTED SPEECH) (REAL CINDY WHI MPERING) (MAN SPEAKS INDISNTICTLY) But where are we going? North Carolina. North Carolina? Mmm-hmm. What's in North Carolina? Us, by tomorrow. But I have a game tomorrow. (PHON E RINGING) Pack your bags. Hello? I don't think she feels like talking to you right now. Mommy? Yeah, baby. What's wrong? Nothing, sweetie. We're just gonna go take a little break, okay? It's Abel. Tell him I'll call him back. She'll call you back. He says he has to talk to you. I'll call you back, Abel. He's already on his way. Are we gonna see Grandma and Grandpa? No, baby, Grandma and Grandpa are gone, remember? Yeah, they're with Daddy. I mean Grandpa and Grandma Lilly. No, we're not going to see them, either. But why not? Baby, I'm just gonna sit you down right here, and you've gotta let Mommy pack, okay? Thank you. It's 'cause of Dad, huh? Ronnie, I really need you to help me right now, okay? Please take your sister into her room and help her get ready, okay? Thank you. RON N IE: Mom? ABBEY: Yeah? What did you do? (BANGING ON DOOR) Hold on! What happened to Scott? August, I'm sorry. He's paralyzed from the neck down. Three of the vertebrate in his neck are completely severed! Huh? I don't know. Huh? You were there. I can't explain it. I can't... Tell me what happened. How'd he break his back? I put him under, and there was something... Something was inside of him that twisted his body, and that... Something was inside of him, and it twisted his body? And you have proof of this? It didn't record. It was all distorted. Abbey... (EXHALES) How in God's name am I supposed to believe this? I know what I saw. Yeah, what you saw? I know what I saw. What you saw? Abbey, what you're doing is hurting people, very obviously! Now, my heart goes out to you, it really does, what you've been through. I understand that, but you leave me no choice. You have the right to remain silent. What? Anything you say or do can and will be held against you in a court of law. ABBEY: No, stop. Stop. AUGUST: You have the right to an attorney. August. August, please, don't do this. Ryan! Sheriff, no. Ryan, you can't. Please. You can't... You can't take me away from my children. August, please, don't. August. August, I know what this looks like. I know what this looks like, but I was there. I saw it. You were there, and you saw what? What did you see? Well, it's the kind of thing that... Well, you'd have to have seen it. No. Bullshit. Now, this woman is not capable of committing any physical harm to any man. AUGUST: I don't know what she is capable of... She's not capable. You know. You know. Hey! Just calm down for a second and hear me out. I know that what's happening here in Nome is frightening. I know it is. But whatever you do, you cannot arrest her for something you don't understand just because you're terrified. Come on. You're pushing it. You're pushing it. I mean, I was there. I saw it. Now you're gonna take her away from her children for something that she did not do. Come on. Come on. Let's just calm down. Please. Please. You will be under 24-hour supervision, and you will not leave these premises. If you touch that doorknob, I will arrest you! ABBEY: I understand. Thank you. You're coming with me. Thank you. Hey, look after your mom. It's okay, sweetheart. Ronnie. This is Ryan, sir. I'm stationed in front of the Tyler home. Over. AUGUST ON RADIO: Roger that. REAL ABBEY: But they said they were questioned by Chief... ...reminded him about the disappearances... OSUNSANMl: What about them? Homicides, missing people. Dozens of them. It's been happening there since the 1960s, and the FBI have been dropping in from time to time. Would you say... OSUNSANMl: what did they find? REAL ABBEY: Nothing. It's inconclusive. To this day, nothing has been solved. what do you think it means? How do you put it in perspective? They have different categories for these types of things. Different levels. An encounter of the first kind, that's when you see a UFO. The second kind is when you see evidence of it: crop circles, radiation. The third kind is when you make contact. But the fourth kind, there's nothing more frightening than the fourth. You see, that one is when they abduct you. And I think it's all part of the same thing. It's all connected, to Will, the missing people, to everything in Nome. If this type of thing was happening to Nome, to me, I think it's happening to other people. Not just there, but all over the world, in towns, cities. Most of them don't even know it. Know they're abducted? How could they know? How could they remember what they're being forced to forget? What the hell? (BREATHING HEAVILY) (REAL RYAN SPEAKING) (GASPING) Holy shit. (POLICE SIRENS WAILING) Where are they? I don't know. I tried to tell you... You don't know? I want the video played back. Sir, it didn't record. It did, but nothing came out. Come on! Bullshit! Ryan, pull yourself together, man. (ABBEY SOBBING) Calm down. Mom. What the hell happened? They took my baby. They took her. Who? They took my baby. What is she talking about? Someone kidnapped Ashley. Okay, I want this entire house searched. I want everybody inside, outside going through these premises top to bottom. Ronnie, what'd you see? Nothing. I came in here and she was gone. What's going on here? August, listen to me. I'm listening. A beam of light came down, and they took her into the sky. They took my little girl up into the sky. I saw it! Through the ceiling? August, I saw it! Through the ceiling? Yes. They took her through the ceiling. What is this craziness? What the hell is going on here? I couldn't stop it. Okay. Everybody clear this room! I want everybody out of here except Ronnie and Abbey! Ronnie, sit down right there, please. Okay? Abbey, you sit down. Please sit down. My baby. Okay? Sit here. I want to talk to you, okay? You just tell me. Listen, less than five hours after I arrest you, your daughter goes missing. I told you. Yeah, but that's horseshit. We know that that's not real. Tell me what happened. You had an officer outside my house. Yes, we had an officer outside. What did he see? He didn't see anything. He says that the videotape wasn't playing. Now, just tell me. Where is she? Listen, Abbey! What did he see? Get him in here right now! You listen to me now. You know what's real! I want to know what he saw. You know what's real! You had an officer outside my house! God damn it! Where is she? (GLASS SHATTERING) You were supposed to protect us! Abbey, where is she, God damn it? You tell me where she is! Where is Ashley? Where is she? Mom! Can't you stop? It's okay. It's okay. RON N IE: Please, just stop! Abbey, you haven't been right in the head since Will. You just haven't been right in the head. You haven't found his killer. What? You still haven't found his killer. No, Abbey, we have. Yes, we have. He's still out there. He's still out there. No. Listen, I'm removing him from your custody. No. Yes, I am, and find a lawyer, because you've run out of all the goodwill I've got, okay? ABBEY: He's not gonna take you away. Guys, get in here. We're removing Ronnie from Abbey's custody! ABBEY: No. No, you're not! You will not... RON N IE: Let go! ABBEY: You will not. No. No. Let go! No. No, no. Baby, baby, no! Let go. Let go. No, no. You're not taking my boy! RON N IE: I'm sorry. You're not taking my boy! OFFICER: He'll be safe! He'll be safe! You're not taking my boy! (SOBBING) God! My babies! Why are you doing this? REAL ABBEY: All I realized, that they weren't going to be able to find her. That I would have to do it on my own. OSUNSANMl: But you couldn't leave. No, that's not what I mean. I had to... To find a way to go directly to them, directly to the source. ABEL: I know what I saw, but I... I can't accept it. I can't. So please don't ask me to, because I can't. I still have to do this. But Scott, you... Is this the right way? I don't know. I don't have a choice. Yeah. I know you don't. ABEL: Your eyes are feeling heavier. Seven, six, five, four, three, two and one. Abbey? Yes. Let's go back three days, to Tuesday, when you were giving dictation in your bedroom. Yes. Good. Now, what happened after you finished your dictation? ...remains unexplained, and worse, unsolved, like Will. Are you sleeping? Yes. What happened next? There's an owl. The owl. It's looking down at me. It's looking down at me. Is it the same owl your patients see? Yes. Yes. Except, it's smiling. Except, it's smiling. I don't like it when it smiles. I don't like it when it smiles. What do you mean, smiling? I don't know what I mean. I don't know what I mean. I don't want to know. I don't want to know. Well, it's too late to forget what you already know. Tell me what you see. It's not an owl. It's not an owl. (GLASS SHATTERS) (ABBEY GASPS) (SCREAMING) (SCREAMING) God, help me! Help me! No. No! No! Help me! Help me! (BOTH SCREAMING) Help me! Help! ABEL: Abbey, what is it? God, help me. There are too many of them. It burns. It hurts! (BOTH SCREAMING) (DRILL WH IRRING) No, no! Please! Stop it. No. (GASPING) (SCREAMING) It's sticking into my shoulder. (ROARING) (REAL ABBEY SPEAKING) (REAL ABBEY SCREAMING) OSUNSANMl: So what happened in that room? They came, and we were... We were... They abducted us. All of us, but brought us back that same night. We don't remember where they took us or what they did to us. Even with hypnosis, it's black. Your voice, or its voice, said it was God. What do you believe? I believe... It's hard, but I believe the things I've seen, the presence I've felt inside of me is beyond anything you can imagine. It was hopelessness, so it cannot be God, but it can... It can pretend to be. And what about Ashley? What about... And what about your daughter? She... I had to recover from that night. It took me a couple of days to wake up. (DOOR OPEN ING) ABBEY: Abel... It's... It's okay. It's okay. What is this? Look, I have to apologize. I... I'm sorry, I really hate to have to do this when you're in this condition that you're in. It's okay. AUGUST: So, well, I still have that question for you, Abbey. How did Will die? He was murdered. No, Abbey. Abbey, he's going to show you something that will upset you, but it has to be done. Understand? This is the head of a man who used this gun. Okay? Yeah. It was suicide, Abbey. It was suicide. He took a pistol, shot himself in the head. There was no intruder. There was no knife. Just him with his pistol at the side of your bed. He's not that man. He wouldn't do that. He wouldn't do that. He wouldn't do that to us. He wouldn't do that to his family. Tell him he's wrong. Tell him. I'm a psychologist, and I would have known... Christ. I would have known if he was gonna... ABEL: Abbey, Abbey. You can't blame yourself for something that was going on in his head. Who knows what he'd learned, what he didn't share, and finally what broke him? AUGUST: Now you know the reality. I'm gonna ask you for the last time. Tell me. What happened to Ashley? Tell me. Abbey. You know what happened. You experienced it. But we came back and she didn't. Abel. Tell him. Tell him what happened. Something took my daughter. I don't know what. I don't... I don't know how. I don't know what it was, but you have to believe me. You have to believe me, please. Please. It's difficult to go back. ABBEY: Go back? Back over the line from fiction to reality. You can't just stop being insane whenever you want to. It's the kind of thing that stays with you forever. OSUNSANMl: So Will committed suicide? Yes. Your credibility. How do you expect me or the audience to believe anything you're saying, if you actually hallucinated the murder of your husband? They weren't hallucinations. I just couldn't... It can be difficult to face the truth, and with Will, that's how I dealt with it. And no matter what you believe, the recordings do not lie. we were talking about things that aren't normal. ...is dead. ...back is broken. And Ashley, she's still gone. These are hard facts. They do appear to be. No, God damn it, they are! You can sit here and speculate, but I have to keep hope alive. I have to believe in what we're doing, my story, that it will help. I have to believe that she's still alive somewhere, that she's safe. I have to believe that there's a chance that I'm gonna see her again, hold her again, hear her voice. I just want my little girl back. She's all I have. Let's stop there. (CRYING) Dr. Tyler, we're done for the night. (INAUDIBLE) Someone else is interested in Nome, as well. Since the 1960s, there have been over 2,000 visits to Nome by the FBI, the highest in Alaska. Second is Anchorage, with a population 76 times larger than Nome. The FBI have paid them 353 visits. In the end, what you believe is yours to decide. MAN 1: UFO Reporting Center. MAN 2: Yeah, I got a doozy for you. Okay. Gonna put me into the hospital, I tell you that. what happened? I'm a truck driver. I had a load to Salt Lake City from Banning. I pulled over, didn't... I got out of the truck, kind of stretched. I looked up at the stars, and I saw these two... There were quite a few of them that were kind of low, and they were, like, flickering. You know, what could they be? And then it occurred to me, maybe I'm seeing a UFO. MAN 3: Portland Air Traffic Control Tower in Portland, Maine. Yes, sir. I guess I have a UFO report. what they drew, and these four people pretty much agree that, actually, what they drew, it looked like a fedora hat... WOMAN 1: I saw something spectacular in the sky last night that I have no explanation for. In fact, I'm sure as many as 50 to 100 people saw it in different areas last night. I'm sure it had as many as 20 pulsating red lights, one white light in the front of it. MAN 4: Like I said, it was about 100 feet from me. To me, it looked about, like, something... Like I said, right... I remember seeing it, but after that it just... I don't exactly remember too much. MAN 5: I could see this very bright red light, and it would change to kind of a blue light, and the reflection off the clouds. MAN 1: Yes? And I could also hear this very loud buzzing noise. WOMAN 2: My daughter is seven years old, and she said it was in the shape of a square. She said she's seen four red lights in the corner and a white one in the middle. MAN 6: Okay. We had an aircraft at 35,000 feet westbound. They reported sighting four objects. Three of them were at his altitude and one of them was a lot lower. MAN 7: We observed an unknown phenomenon this morning, about 1600 Zulu, and we observed it for about 10 to 15 minutes. The targets were approximately 200 miles west of San Francisco over the water. They flew in what appeared to be unison, approximately 90 miles apart. Their speed was in excess of 2,000 knots. They did a high-speed run for about 75 miles, made a very abrupt slowdown, and then a 180-degree turn, and tracked back northbound in excess of 2,000 knots. WOMAN 3: It had fire-engine red lights, kelly green lights, orange lights. It would shut all them lights down and turn a bright white. It was zigzagging in and out. It was shooting from one side of the sky to the other side. It was almost as if it was rolling. MAN 8: After eight to 12 seconds of this boiling, we saw an object come up out of the water and go straight up into the air. It was a circular-shaped object. MAN 9: To give you a brief on it, I was dispatched on a UFO sighting. When I arrived, what I saw was a real large craft in the air, circular. I would say it was at least 25 yards wide, or in diameter actually, it would be, and it was hovering over a house, and it was motionless. MAN 10: They're real bright, like a star, and when it gets closer to you, it gets dimmer. Then when it lands, it goes into a big, big orange, kind of like looking at the sun or something. MAN 1: Uh-huh. And then when the light goes out, it's like you turned down a kerosene lamp. MAN 11: what exactly happened was, it was myself and a friend were flying. I'm a commercial pilot. MAN 1: Yes. And we saw this object, and it wasn't bright like a light. It was shining like polished aluminum, or polished metal. Yes. MAN 12: Like a point source that was emanating several shafts of black light. It was like negative light. There's gotta be several hundred people that saw it. MAN 13: We had an aircraft that sighted a UFO. The pilot reported an object passed approximately one eighth of a mile in front of the aircraft. It was described as being box-shaped. WOMAN 4: And as soon as I pulled over, this object came straight at us, straight to our vehicle. It was huge. This thing was huge. It was black, huge. It had these triangle lights on it. MAN 14: I have never been a believer of UFOs in my entire life, and I just seen a minimum of nine this morning with my own eyes, and, I mean, I am a believer. One orange, and at least nine of the bright, bright moving lights. WOMAN 5: I was just staring at it, stopped in my vehicle, and it started to move, and it had lights down each side of it, like a triangle. MAN 1: Yes? And then, next thing I know, I didn't take my eyes off the damn thing. It was gone. WOMAN 6: My little brother, he's three, he'll be four next month, last night he started talking to my parents, and I just got done talking with him. He told my dad, "You have to lock the door, "'cause the creatures are gonna come get me," and he said, "The men in the stars," he said, "they're coming to get me." They follow him. when he goes outside, he says, "The star follows me. "The star follows me." MAN 15: You'd have to experience this in order to believe me. I'm afraid to walk outside. I need help. I don't know how to deal with this. It's so strange. I'm frightened to go to sleep. what if they come back?
