What you're about to see may feel somewhat familiar to you. Same but different. Like deja vu. Remember the movie where that guy gets stuck living in eternity in that small town in Pennsylvania, in the middle of winter? What's his name again? Bill something? Anyway, it's like that except this is a Christmas tale. You see my friend, Eddie, he used to be a great kid, but then this swag thing came along which forced me to pull a prank on him and ugh... I'm getting ahead of myself. Why don't we just start at the beginning? That way you can see for yourself what happened. ♪ Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one... ♪ Hey. Yeah, I just picked up the tray liner, sconces... Yep. I'm walking in right now. Uh-huh, yup, I'm here, okay. I love you too. All right, see ya. Hey, buddy. Hey, buddy. Come here, buddy. Oh, come here! Where's Marilyn, huh? Hey. Good morning, Zach. How's the loading going? Well, it's pretty hectic actually. Antonio and Francisco are gonna be here any minute, and are you sure it's okay that we're having the wedding here? Stop. My boy's a man now. I know your mother would be proud of you. Thanks, Dad. Where is Marilyn? She's upstairs, said something about trying on Spanx? Okay, I have no idea what that means. Where's Eddie? I thought he was with you. No, I thought he was with you. - Taz. - Taz. I don't know how to tell you this, Taz. But if we don't make it through this... It's been real, man. That it has, Eddie. That it has. Bro. The Tubinator did not disappoint. Heck, yeah. Ah. ♪ Merry Christmas ♪ Merry Christmas ♪ Aw, snap, my dad. I gotta go. What am I supposed to do with the Tubinator? Take it home. Later! What? Eddie. I asked you to be there at the house to help load in the stuff for the wedding. What happened to working together? We're the Kirkpatrick wolf pack, aroo! Aroo! Come on, Dad. Look at all that snow. I couldn't resist. Besides, I'm pretty sure the wolf pack is getting ripped apart by a lioness named Marilyn. Eddie, don't start this again. First she expects us to celebrate her wedding day when it's actually Christmas. And now she expects manual labor? Unbelievable! Eddie, don't do this. This wedding means a lot to her and Zach. Shouldn't that be cause enough for you to support your brother? Fine. Thank you. But on one condition. What's that, son? You buy me those Breezy 3000's in Ridiculous Red. You shouldn't put too much importance on how you look. That's not what's important in life. It's what's in here. Cheese much, Dad? I'm serious. You stay wrapped up in yourself and your image, you'll end up missing the important moments in life. I'm surprised you got the Rinaldi brothers to do your wedding. My friend Cheryl said they didn't even call her back. She called two years in advance, didn't even have a groom. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I don't care. I don't care. I don't care if this is the middle of winter. I promised my bride hydrangeas, she's getting her hydrangeas, okay? If they hear any Ricky Martin, they're gonna have a conniption, do you understand? No Ricky Martin. Hey. How's it going? It's going okay. Yeah. - Marilyn. - You tell her. I'm not telling her. We don't mean to bother you, but... We may have a problem with the tuxes. The boutonnieres are all wrong. They should be cranberry not raspberry. Hey, I think the bride and I just need sec to chat, okay? Well, that's fine, but... If it's not the correct berry, it's not truly a Rinaldi brothers wedding. That's right. My brother learned so fast. A couple years ago, he was a lifeguard at Waterworld. And now look at him. He's so grown-up. Come on, come on, come on, come on. Yeah, let's give them a minute, guys, yeah? Yeah, just a minute. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Come on, guys, let's go. Okay. Hoo, yeah. Just doing some last-minute things before I really get to stress out. Baby, you should just relax, okay? Maybe take a bubble bath. Oh, yeah. Maybe in a bit. Hey, did you ever find your little brother? Oh, yeah, he'll be here in a second. Listen, there's something you should know about Eddie. He's a good kid. But ever since our mom passed away, he's been a bit caught up. You know? Zach. You know I know what it's like to lose someone. That's part of the reason why we're having the wedding tomorrow. I know. I know, I just... If he gives you any trouble, just go easy on him. I don't think he's very comfortable having a she wolf enter the Kirkpatrick wolf pack. - She wolf? - Mm-hm. Oh, you don't even know. - Grr. - Oh, wow. - Grr! - That's very scary. - Grr! - I swear, Cletus... ...if those flowers are not here by the break of day, I will Yelp you so hard your hair will blow back, my friend. Cletus, smarten up, or I'm gonna have to come down there, okay? Everything's fine. Come on. It's just a small technical problem. But it will be resolved in a split second, okay? We'll go? Oh, there he is. Hey, man. Hey. So... ...you wanna go help me unload the truck? Is that a serious question? It is, come with me. But I'm happy that you figured it out. Hey. Why don't you go talk to her? I wasn't... I wasn't looking. Uh-huh. All right, first, she's older than me. And even if I was her age, she'd be way out of my league. Second, she's dating this guy Brad. He's basically a teenage Schwarzenegger. Rome wasn't built in a day. You never know what could happen when you guys get older. I'm stuck in the friend zone. Did I ever tell you how Marilyn and I got together? Her grandma was one of my patients. Now Marilyn was there every time she came in for one of her treatments. I knew Marilyn was the one the first time she came in. But I also knew that pursuing her then would be wrong. So we became friends. Genuine friends. Now I was there to help her through her grandma's failing health until eventually she passed. And I was there to help her heal after. I wanted to be there for her. Eventually, our friendship became a relationship, and now here we are. Look, all I'm saying is... Sometimes it doesn't hurt to start out as friends. Did she happen to tell you about her strange fascination with birds? Hey, where do you want these? Oh, just somewhere safe. Okay. Oh... What has she done to you? Come on. Oh. Oh. What is going on? Ugh. Zach! Good evening, Eddie. The time is 10:06 p.m. It was so crazy, man. She was all like, "Zach!" And I was, like, so responsible for it happening. Dude. So, yeah. My day ended up being pretty awesome. - How 'bout yours? - Well, you left me alone with the Tubinator. And since it was too heavy to drive back alone, I slipped while trying to heave it up my garage, and it decided to take me for a ride. That's so awesome! Not in a good way. I almost broke my ankle.

Today is about your brother and Marilyn. We'll open Christmas presents tomorrow. Oh, that reminds me. I've gotta work on my speech for tonight. Ed, have you worked on yours?

Oh, I didn't notice because there are no presents under the tree! What? Can I use the bathroom, Princess Marilyn? Why can't you just use the one downstairs? Lorenzo and Stupendo are keeping the doves in the bird cages down there. It's just gross. - Antonio and Francisco? - What? Antonio and Francisco, that's their names. And judging what happened with you and the birds yesterday, I would really prefer if you weren't anywhere near them. Eddie. I know that this Christmas is different than the ones you usually have with Zach and your dad, but I've been waiting for this day since I was ten years old. Just give me five minutes. Okay, just give me five minutes, and then you can have the bathroom back, okay? - No. - What? I'm standing up for myself and for Christmas. This isn't funny. Zach's gonna be here. I don't want to risk him seeing me in the dress. Fine. Wait. - I want to see the dress. - Why?

She's too hot. I'd give in every time. Every time. Well, statistically speaking, the human condition doesn't allow for people to stay together for longer than seven years. So, if you wait long enough, you'll be the perfect age for her by the time they break up. Then you can get in your seven. What's with everybody telling me to play the waiting game?

Well, tears of joy. Okay, we're counting on you, man.

No. We're like... LeBron James and Kyrie Irving. "Unseperable" duo. I don't care if he is going through a hard time, he has to be a better brother to you, Zach. It's fine, I just don't expect much from him to begin with. He's young and immature. He's just so selfish. Selfish? Where are the doves? Where are the doves? Ricky, Ricky, where are we at with the doves? He's flippin' out. Oh, I can't believe this is gonna happen. Ladies and gentlemen. Can I have your attention please? It's time for the best man to give his speech right now. So will Eddie please come up here? Eddie? Thank you, I know. I look good. Speaking of looks, what about the bride, huh? I mean, oh, wow... How could someone like Zach get someone like her, right? No, no, no, like seriously. Zach has like zero swag. Have you ever seen him dance? All right, I can stop showing you, he can show you when he gets up here in a minute. You know, Zach. I was gonna say that... You and me are like LeBron and Kyrie. But that's off, way, way off. I'd say we're more like oil and water. You know, we never see eye to eye. I don't even know why you had me be your best man. Considering... Considering how selfish and immature I am. Hey. Good luck with your new life with Marilyn. Looking forward to never seeing you again. Eddie, come on. Eddie. I knew that this was gonna happen. We got a code "nutcracker."

Plus, I think if you really work at it, in a few years she might fall for you. Exactly the problem. There's only a day. This day, forever. At first I thought yeah, it would be cool to do whatever I want and have fun. But you don't understand, Taz! You don't understand! I'm stuck forever in purgatory. The same day, no presents. My brother gets married to that witch and I can't do anything about it. I like Marilyn, she's nice. Nice? She called me selfish, Taz. Me, selfish! She's taking my brother away, man. She's the reason this whole day is repeating. Dude, did you hit your head or something? You're dating me, I mean... All right, well maybe I shouldn't be dating you if you just want to... Where I come from, people don't really need presents to feel like Christmas. Actually what's most important is each other's company. Love the nerdy girl who can kick butt. And the blue hair is just awesome. Dude. You there? She got here before Brad, right? Uh, yeah? Okay, what time did we get here? Huh? What time did we get here? I don't know, like 20 minutes ago? 10:15. I know what I need to do. You can come with me if you want. Where are we going? - To get Frankfurt. - Who's Frankfurt? The guy for Cindy. Ready. Set. Go. Frankfurt! What time did you come into work today? Uh, do I know you? No... We've met, but you wouldn't understand. Just what time did you come into work today? When the mall opened, 10:00. Christmas, so we opened a little late. And I get to go home early too, so that's cool. Why do you need to know all this? You'll see tomor... Today. Just, you'll see.

Oscar, you little stinky boy. This is it. Last Christmas. Oh here, here, let me help you out. Oh, thank you. I'm so stressed out. Breaking the cycle today. Antonio, Francisco. - Yeah? - Yeah? I wanted to say sorry. I always knew your names. What the heck are you talking about? Nothing, but... Good luck today. You know, he may be a little cuckoo but... He's a nice kid. Shalom, hom-- Yeah, yeah, shalom man. But come on, we gotta roll. Diner, right? Yeah, but we gotta make a pit stop first. What are we doing? Playing matchmaker. What's that I got? I'm rockin' Breezy 3000's! Frankfurt with the Blue Swan shirt. Follow me to meet a new cute nerd. Uh, do I know you? Ah, Frankfurt my name is Eddie Kirkpatrick, we've met several times but not in a way you could ever understand. Just trust me and please follow me to the diner. What's your deal, you the muscle in this operation? Me? No, I'm just as confused as you are. Probably more actually. But you should probably listen to whatever he says because my dude can like see the future and what not. Dude, I'll buy you hotcakes. Oh, free breakfast? Yeah, all right, I'm in. It's Christmas day, I could be a little late. That's what I'm talking about Frankie boy. Follow me. Perfect. Merry Christmas, what can I get you? - Hot cakes. - Hot cakes. Hot cakes. Well that was complicated. So, why are we here again? Free breakfast? Cindy's about to walk through that door in less than a minute. And I'm gonna have Frankfurt here to run interference with Brad. Wait, I thought you liked Cindy. Sometimes if you love a girl you have to give her away. To a Frankfurt. And how do you know she's gonna walk through that door? She will. Hi, I'm Cindy. I love your shirt. Uh thanks, I'm Frankfurt. I love your hair. Merry Christmas, guys. Merry Christmas, Cindy. Merry Christmas. So you've been watching Blue Swan a long time or... Yeah, like for years. - I love it. - Yeah, same. I mean, my favorite. Yeah, my dad got me into it. - Oh, same. - Really? You're a wizard. Nah, I'm stuck. But not for long. Hey Brad! You're done messing with Cindy. So why don't you just go home and have a Merry Christmas by yourself and Van Damme. Whoa. - Thanks, Frankfurt. - Thank you, man. I have to go back to work for a few hours after this, but... Maybe you'd want to hang out afterwards? Definitely. Cool. Man, I'm good. I was good today. And helped people. I didn't screw up the wedding. It felt good. Please. Please let tomorrow be...

Merry Christmas, Eddie. I don't understand. I've done everything I'm supposed to do. What else do I need to do to make this stop? I miss you, mom. I don't want to tear this family apart, but... she's gonna take Zach away and... Marilyn? What are you doing here? Well, I came here to think before I have to start getting ready. Looks like you're doing the same thing. Yeah. Are you okay? I don't know. Listen. In no way am I trying to get in the middle of you, your dad, and Zach. That's not what I'm here for. When I met Zach, he told me how hard it was for you to lose your mom. He was there for me when I was losing my grandma. But that wouldn't have happened if I pushed him away. Eddie. You need to let people in. But I'm sure you just think I'm some bridezilla that hijacked Christmas. I'd never say that. Sure. Oh, I gotta go. Are you coming? Um... I'll be there in one minute. Okay. So, that's it. I had to figure out how to accept Marilyn into my family. You see how great these shoes look? Look at that. Every, every piece in the perfect place. It's as if someone spent hundreds of hours making sure that this shoe looked unlike any other shoe out there on the market. Until... You start to uncover. And that's how you get to the sole of the matter. And you soon realize, well this shoe... is just really pieces of plastic and cloth just like every other shoe. But you gotta strip away all the layers in order to get to the bottom of it. Aren't you supposed to be at a wedding, Eddie? Oh, uh... Frankfurt, I need you man. It is vital that you come with me right now. Sir, no offense but... I don't know you. I know. Okay, okay, listen. What if I told you there was someone truly special out there for you. Someone who understands you and will care about you more than anything. And is just waiting two blocks away to meet you. I would say that's weird. No, it's not. It's Christmas. Wait, what are you doing coming to work anyway? I'm saving up to buy some Breezy 3000's. Dude, forget the shoes. Are you gonna let something like swag potentially get in the way of meeting the girl of your dreams? 'Cause she's out there, and I know her. And she's really hot.

It's time for the best man to give his speech right now. So will Eddie please come up here? Eddie? When mom wanted us to eat our vegetables, she used to tell us that we had superpowers. And... if we didn't eat them, they'd go away. Now that I'm not a kid, I realize that those superpowers have to come from within. Powers like patience. Friendship. Trust. She used to tell us that the most important thing is that we hold onto those powers. Otherwise we'd get sick. Now... I know that... I haven't been the best person to rely on, but... I want Zach and Marilyn to know that there is nothing more important than... than seeing you two happy. May love be your superpower. May you never get sick of eating it. Hey, Ed. I wish your mom could've seen that, kiddo. I'm super proud of you. You miss her too. Of course. And on days like today, whether it's Christmas or our wedding... she's everywhere. I'm sorry, dad. Well, I'm not. See, Eddie, all that matters is that we stay strong as a family. That's what she would've wanted.
