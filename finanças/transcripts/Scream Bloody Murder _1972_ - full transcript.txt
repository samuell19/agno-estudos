That I only have one hand. - Why would I hate you? - I don't know, some people think it's sickening when they see someone who's not whole. - Oh no they don't, you're being dramatic. - They do, I see it in their faces. They get sick inside when they see that all I have for a hand is a hook. - Well I don't get sick, at all, inside or outside. I'm not even gonna ask you what happened to your hand either. - You're not? You don't care? - Sure I care, only the way I see it, I figure it's your hand, your story. If you wanna tell me, you'll tell me. - You're a very special person Daisy. - Well thanks, but my names not Daisy, it's Vera. - I'd like to call you Daisy, is that okay? - Sure it's okay, if you tell me why you have your hand behind your back. - I brought you something, a present. - You did, what is it. - Well I-- - Well show me, show me. (dramatic chord) You frightened me, I thought you were gonna stab me with that thing. - I'd never hurt you Daisy. - Where did you get this? It's mine, isn't it? - Yes, I waited for you to finish before with the sailor, and after you went in, he, the sailor, he cut up your painting and took your painting knife. I followed him asking for it, told him it was very important to you and he, well finally he gave it back to me. I only wanted you to have it back Daisy, that's all. - The sailor cut up my painting? - Yes I saw him with my own eyes, he was bad, very bad. - Yeah I guess he was. - You should never see people like that, like the sailor anymore, they're dangerous, very dangerous. - Well they have money, they keep me going, you know what I mean. - I have money, lots of it. I have enough money so you'd never need to see those men anymore. - Sure you do kid. - Honest, well my fathers very rich. He owns lots and lots of things. Farms, and oil wells, and machinery. We live in a big mansion with servants.

I guess cause the way I look, or maybe it was my one hand. Maybe they didn't want me in their house, a cripple. - Sounds like the folks in this neighborhood, you know, they wouldn't give you the time of day if they owned all the clocks in the world. - I guess I'd better go. - Hey, wait a second boy. Are you sure your car's broke down? - Oh yes ma'am, right around the corner. I can't get it to move. - Well all right, come on in and wipe your feet. - Yes ma'am - The phones in the kitchen, just follow me. - Yes ma'am. - [Woman] Bridey-Lee who was that?

You have your hand behind your back again. What have you got now, another palette knife? - A flower, picked from the front yard of my mansion. - Picked from the front yard of my mansion. How easily you say that. - Well, do you like it? - Yes, yes very much. Only you know, it's not a daisy. - I know, but we can pretend that it's a daisy. Just like we pretend that it's your name. - Okay, okay, it's a daisy. - You want to see my car? It's right over here. - Sure, I'll see your car. Wow, I didn't know there were any of these jobs still around. - Then you like it? - Like it, it must be worth a fortune. - I told you I was rich, I told you and I have enough money to take care of you and you never need to see those men anymore. - Hold it, hold it, slow down. Okay, so maybe you are rich, but I never gave you the idea that I was for sale, did I? - No. But I only wanna-- - It's a very nice car. And you're a very nice boy, but take it easy with the owning me stuff. Okay, friend? - Okay, if. - If? - If you let me take you for a ride in my car to show you my mansion and to show you that I really am a rich person. - I got it, I got it. So this is what it's like to ride in style, huh? - [Matthew] Fantastic, isn't it? It's a very expensive car you know, there are only a few of them left in the whole world. - [Vera] No kidding. - [Matthew] And my father owns three more, just as valuable. And wait till you see the mansion, that's really expensive, it costs millions. - [Vera] Come on, millions? [Matthew] And I've got a special surprise waiting for you when we get there. I did it all by myself, just for you. - [Vera] What kind of surprise? - [Matthew] Oh, you'll see. It's the last thing I'm going to show you in the mansion. I'm saving the best for last. - [Vera] But you didn't even know I was coming with you today. - [Matthew] Sure I did. That's why there's a surprise for you in the house. - [Vera] Don't even get a hint? - [Matthew] It has to do with the fact that you're such a good painter. - It has something to do with my painting and it's the last thing you'll show me in the house. - Very nice. - We could have big dinner parties here and invite all kinds of interesting people who don't get to come to houses like this. - [Vera] We could? - Yes, if you'll move in here with me just as my friend, oh, we'd have a lot of fun Daisy. - [Vera] No. - I'm rushing you. I shouldn't do that. Peace? - Peace. - There's sunlight in here all day long, and I took out all the furniture. And I'll buy you paints and an easel, and everything. You'll like that, won't you? - There are a lot of thing in life that I'd like but I learned to do without them. - You don't listen, I've got lots of money, I can buy you everything. - People belong where they belong. I'm an armature painter who turns tricks to make the rent, that's where I belong. - No. No you don't. You're better than that. You don't need the dirty money from the sailors and the guys who touch you. - It's a way of life. You get so used to doing things one way, it's not so bad anymore. I couldn't stay here with you, it wouldn't be my home. - No, this is your home Daisy. - Look I don't wanna get cruel with you, I had a lot of fun seeing your house, and your daddies money but now it's time to go. - Why? Why? Why, what's wrong with living here huh? What's wrong with having everything you want? Money, and food, and clothes. You could be a famous painter maybe. - It's okay, you don't want to drive me home, I'll take a bus, it's okay. - No, don't leave. We're friends. - Yeah, yes we're friends, you and I. - Where are you going? - To my home. - This is your home. - I have my own home. - There are men there though, they'll touch you. - It's okay, I don't mind, I like it, it's okay. - No, you don't want them to touch you. Come back here, come back here. - I've lots of friends in the neighborhood, they'll miss me, they'll come looking for me. - They won't know where to look. They'll look for a little while and then they'll stop looking, and you'll be here with me. Forever and ever. Daisy, Daisy. - No! - No, you'll get used to it, I promise you, you'll learn to like it. - No, please. (Vera cries out) (Vera thudding) - No! What'd you do that for Daisy? I wasn't gonna hurt you. I'd never hurt you. I want to give you things. To make you happy. I want you and me to be good friends. We are gonna be good friends now, aren't we Daisy? Oh you'll like it Daisy. I promise you.

A steak, well who else ever bought you a steak before, huh? Nobody that's who. And paints, and an easel, an easel, how do you like that? There's more damn stuff here than you've ever seen in your life. Do you appreciate it? No. No you don't appreciate it. Fine dresses and nice food. The best art stuff they had in their whole store. I'd like to have seen the sailor buy you things like this. Well he wouldn't would he? Huh? Would he? Would he? Would he? Damn right he wouldn't. All he wanted to do was make you filth. Touch you and look at you. Well I'm not damn sorry I cut his throat for him. (Vera whimpers) Oh, didn't I tell you I killed the sailor? Well I did, I did it just for you. So we can be together, you and me. See what I do for you? I get groceries and clothes, and art stuff, kill people. And do you appreciate it? No. N-O. But you will. You'll learn to count on me for everything. That's it, chew it up real good. If you don't chew your food you'll get sick. - I don't want anymore. - You've got to eat Daisy, otherwise you'll waste away and become nothing but skin and bones. - Please, I don't want anymore. - Eat. - No. - Eat or I'll cut your tongue out of your mouth. - You. - Yes? - I'll eat. - That's nice Daisy. I know you enjoy this food, don't you? - I hate it. - Well keep eating, you'll learn to like it. (Vera spits) You'll get used to all of this. And then you'll be very happy, won't you Daisy? - My name is Vera. - No. It's Daisy. - Vera. - It's Daisy. (phone rings) What's the matter? Think it's for you? It's not. Would you like some more to eat my dear? (Vera crying) No? That's too bad, it's very good.

We're gonna start having a lot of fun around here, you and me, a lot of fun. Goodnight. (light clicks) (door clicks) Aren't you going to paint something? You said you like to paint more than anything. - I don't feel like painting. - Huh? What's that, I didn't hear you Daisy. - I don't feel like painting. - Why? Why not? There's paints, there's brushes, there's an easel. You never had an easel before did you, huh? - No, I never had an easel. - Well I bet you could paint very nice pictures with an easel, all you gotta do is try Daisy, try. - I can't. - Yes you can. - I feel like a dog on a leash. - I know daisy, I know. But soon I'll be able to trust you. And I won't have to make sure that you won't run away from me. You'll be much happier then, you'll see. - Matthew, I want to go home. - You are home Daisy, you are home. - No. (doorbell rings) - Don't you-- - Please, please! Help me, help me, please! Please help me! No, help me, help me, help me! Please, help me! Please! (Vera screaming) (dramatic music) (Vera screams) (Vera cries) - Who are you? - I'm Matthew, who are you? - Dr. Epstein, Helen Anatole's physician. - She's not at home. - What do you mean she's not at home? Her car's right out front, where is she? - She's, I'm her nephew. - She never mentioned a nephew to me son. Now. (Vera crying out) (dramatic music) Back East? What the hell are you talking about? - My grandfather died, her brother. She went back east to the funeral in Maine. - And you? - She asked me to come here and watch the house. (dramatic music) Yes sir. - You're making that up. - I never lie sir. - When will she be back? - I'm not too sure sir. (door bangs) - Bridey, is she here? - No sir, that's why I'm here. Bridey went with aunt Helen to Maine. - I can't believe she'd go without informing me. She needs her arthritis shot every other day. Your aunt should know better. - Well I'm sure you understand the emergency, what with grandpa dying and all. She was very upset. - Well I suppose I might as well. You don't mind if I look around do you? Just for my own peace of mind. - But I already told you. - Let's start with Mrs. Anatole's room first, shall we? I've been telephone here for three days without getting an answer and I want to know what's happening in this house. - You better leave right now, my aunt would be very upset if she knew I let you in here. (Vera banging) - What's that? - It was the dog, it was the dog in the kitchen. - Sounds like it's coming from down there for Christs sake. - Look mister, you can't just come in here and-- - I want to know what's going on here. (dramatic music) God. (dramatic music) - Told you you'd be sorry, didn't I Daisy? This is all your fault. This never would have happened if you'd only cooperate. He would have gone home and everything would have been fine. Now he's dead. (door bangs) And it's all because of you. I hope this teaches you a lesson. To try to cooperate and live nicely as my friend. I wouldn't want anything like this to happen again. Would you? Good, me neither. See here, see? Not one word of your disappearance, not one. You're safe. They can't find us and they don't even want to. Just you and me Daisy, we're free. No one will ever bother us again. Right? Right Daisy, hmm? - Right, right, right. - Yes. Very right. - Matthew? - [Matthew] Mmhm. - Matthew, I haven't had a bath since I've been here. - Yes? - Well maybe I'd, I mean I think I'd feel a lot better if I had a nice hot bath. I've been wearing these clothes a long time. Matthew? - How do I know this isn't a trick to try and get away from me? - You could take all of my clothes and leave me nothing but a towel to dry with, I couldn't run away without clothes. - I don't know. - Well then you could watch me while I take the bath to make sure I don't try anything. - No, I don't want to. I mean I don't think it will be necessary. - All right. All right Matthew, I don't have to take a bath. All right. - Do you really want to take a bath? - Yes, please. - What would it hurt if you took a bath, right? - Yes. - You better hand me your clothes like you said you would. - Don't you trust me? - No I don't trust you, hand me those clothes. - Sure, Vera's clothes coming up. - I'm sorry to have to treat you like this Daisy but until I can be sure that you won't try to leave me I have to. You understand, don't you? - [Vera] Of course, I understand perfectly. - That's good because I. - Here. And here's the rest of them. Well take it already Matthew, take it. You said you wanted the rest of my clothes, this is all of them. Take it Matthew, take it. - God damn you. - Poor Matthew. - God damn you. - Poor, poor, Matthew. - God damn you! (door bangs) (water splashing) - Matthew. - What? - I'm finished. - Yes? - I mean, I thought you might like to know when I was done. - Oh yeah, yeah sure. - Well. - Well what? - What happens now? - Now we go back to the bedroom and you put on one of those things I got for you and then I tie you up again. - It's your mansion. - And don't try to run away or anything. - Who's running? Here I am, at your beck and call Matthew. - Don't make fun of me. - I'm not. Isn't this what you wanted? Do everything you tell me to. I eat when you want, I sleep when you want, I'm your prisoner. Aren't you happy? - You better put some clothes on now. - Why? Don't you like me without clothes on Matthew? - It's just that, I think it's better if you get dressed now, that's all. - Other men like me without clothes on. - I don't like those other men. I want you to get dressed, I have to tie you up now. - They like to look at me, they like to touch me, they like to make love with me Matthew. - I don't care about those other men. They're filthy, disgusting. - Wouldn't you like to make love with me Matthew? Haven't you ever made love Matthew, huh? - You better stop this now. - We're going to live together, then we're have to make love together. - No we don't, we don't have to. - You said you'd provide me with everything I need. You have to provide love to. - No, no. - Come on Matthew. - Don't do this. - Come, we'll be friends and more, much, much more. I'll teach you. I'll teach you Matthew. - Please. - You'll see, you'll love me even more than you do now. Come. - I better stop, no more. - Didn't you like it, don't you like to kiss me? - Yes, yes I like to. I like to. - That's it, kiss me, kiss me. - See I can provide for you, I can. I'll make you very happy Daisy, very happy. - Yes, yes, yes Matthew, yes. (dramatic chord) - What have you become? - What's the matter Matthew? - What's the matter Matthew? - You're hurting me Matthew! - Why don't you die! Why don't you stay dead and leave me alone, leave me alone, leave me alone! - Matthew, Matthew! Somebody, somebody help me! (dramatic music) (Vera crying out) Oh my God, help me, help me, somebody! Help me, help me, help! (both screaming) (door bangs) (Daisy laughing) - [Daisy] Matthew, I'm waiting for you Matthew, we all are. Come. - No! - [Daisy] Come! (Daisy laughing) (dramatic music) - No. (Daisy laughing) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (Daisy laughing) (dramatic music) (tires screeching) (dramatic music) - God damn son of a bitch!
