STRAIGHT LINES. DON'T BE LATE. It's always the same. Life is the dictatorship of chance over the weak. - But it's not a story. - Of course it is. Why wouldn't it be? I am not capable, of telling my story. Five volumes, five chapters, five stanzas, five verses, five acts, five sentences, five words. You choose. I like your story. I'm hooked already. Why? I think by the end, I'll have fallen for you! You are not me! You are not me! - You're not me! - I am not you! - That's just it! - Yes! - Right, you're not me! - You're not me! So, what do you think? Tell me. Let's try again, I'll do it more, more... Take your time! - I'm trying! - There's no-one here. You're no bother! - Yes, I know! - Stop as much as you like! Take all the time you need! - OK. - Let's go! I could hear that from the stairs! "If it's too loud, you're too old." Charles Dickens? Ted Nugent, American rocker. I was going to ask you some questions, but I see that this Ted doesn't teach you much. STRAIGHT LINES. GOD LOVES LINES. I HAD SOME STRAIGHT LINES HERE, BUT I SNORTED THEM. HE'S RIGHT, LINES ARE USEFUL FOR WRITING. This one! You should've got a new tie! Unless the programme's on the History channel. Great! I'll go without a tie! - Break a leg! - I like this attitude better! Why are you so reluctant? Is it because it's television? I've got nothing against television, it's as good a place as any to be stupid. Damn, you get more pessimistic by the day! What about you? How are things? Still the same old sh*t. It's been worse. What about Conceição? We haven't spoken since, only through lawyers. You'll meet Raquel, I'm bringing her to dinner. What about you? I don't like talking about my life. Can't we take a bit off? Don't worry, you won't notice it later on TV, OK? António Almeida, Marco Resende, our director. Relax, have a seat. Just one more thing. You start, then hand over to António. We start with International news, so I'll speak first. If that's OK with António? If anything goes wrong, remember: just keep talking, no silence. - Which camera is first? - Camera 1. Call Sónia. Get her here. Good evening, our guest tonight is António Almeida, writer and journalist, and author of a notable column read by many of us, "Crooked Lines". His sharpness, irony and humour have made António Almeida a much-loved journalist and it is these qualities that bring him here today. It strikes me, there's a big confusion here. You can't ask an international body of this size to suddenly... If we look at... Let's hear António Almeida. Are you worried by the rise of nationalism in Europe? and even in the US? I'm more concerned What worries me the most is that nationalism and the extreme right are the direct consequences of the failure of liberal democracy. Perhaps we can accept the failure of liberal democracy, but not a fascist regime. In the 30s, we used to say: anyone who doesn't want to criticise capitalism, should keep quiet about fascism. Well, for me it's very clear... You know the text! The text isn't the problem, I think the text is good, What is it, then? What's worrying you? What's the matter? Life with David's a mess. I thought it'd be different when we moved to Lisbon, that a change of city, of country could be good for us... He's frustrated because it's not going as well as he hoped and I'm not much help. You think it's funny? What are you waiting for? Send him back to London. He's an arrogant sh*t and doesn't even like being here. And you? I stopped thinking about that. You can't think about happiness if you want to be in a good mood. What is it? Maximum temperatures are 15 degrees Celisus for Lisbon, 13 for Porto, 17 degrees for Faro. We'll be back tomorrow. See you tomorrow, weather permitting. - Evening. - Well? I won't be doing that again. - You have to try again. - You go. They're looking for someone. Chill. SOCIETY MUST POISON A MAN SEVERAL TIMES OVER HIS LIFE BEFORE HE DIES. STRAIGHT LINES. THERE ARE VERY FEW FAT REBELS. THE EMPIRE'S FUTURE COULD LIE IN FREE SUGAR. IT'S CRUCIAL TO SWITCH POSITIONS. MUSEUM REVEALS THE SIZE OF RASPUTIN'S PENIS Here is your order. Enjoy! Can I? Would you like anything else? I'm not sure it's nice, but it's certainly moving. I think I'm good at making people feel things. I don't even do it on purpose. I don't even do it on purpose. It just comes out like that, it's natural. Oh my god... STRAIGHT LINES. GOD DOESN'T LIKE STRAIGHT LINES. DOES HE PREFER THEM CROOKED SO IT'S MORE NOTICEABLE HE WRITES STRAIGHT? MAYBE. PEOPLE DRAW STRAIGHT LINES. HE DREW CURVED AND CROOKED ONES. DOES THAT MEAN ANYTHING? NO. SO GOD'S AN ARTIST. I SEE YOU'RE ABOUT TO OPEN IN A PLAY. YES, IT'S MY FIRST PROPER ROLE. I MUST REMEMBER TO CONGRATULATE THE COMPANY. I HAD A FIRST AS WELL YESTERDAY. A FIRST? YES, A FIRST AS A FOOL. I'D LIKE TO SEE YOU ON OPENING NIGHT. I CAN LEAVE TWO TICKETS FOR GRIGORI RASPUTIN. DON'T COUNT ON ME PRAISING YOUR HUMOUR, IT'S THE BIGGEST MISTAKE MODERN MEN MAKE. Do you know who he is, yet? No, not yet. And you're going to meet him anyway? No, he's coming to the show and then we'll see. Prepare yourself, the guy's either old or married, or bedridden or a bit of each. AND YOU'LL FALL IN LOVE WITH A DEAD RUSSIAN WITCH. NOW FOR REAL: CROSS YOUR FINGERS FOR ME. Never mind, he's the coolest guy ever. Is that a joke? No. Good evening. Enjoy the show. Good evening. You're the contemporary one, aren't you? I'm the what? The contemporary one. They told me just now, but I already suspected. Contemporary of what? Contemporary of today, contemporary like more modern than modern, more avant-garde than anything. You've got the look, you are very much part of your time. - Which is? - Now. And now. And now, for example. It never ends. Then, of course, the clothes you wear must match your ontological convictions. Like, someone traditional or sentimental... Those people have to dress differently than a contemporary person. That seems obvious to me. A whisky please. WERE YOU THERE? YES. WHERE DID YOU SIT? CLOSE. I THOUGHT YOU'D COME UP TO ME AFTER THE SHOW. THEY ASK A LOT OF ME AT COURT, I CAN'T GET AWAY FOR LONG. I'D LIKE TO COME AND MEET YOU. SUCH A CHARMING GIRL SHOULD KEEP HER DISTANCE FROM A SPECTRE. SPECTRES SHOULDN'T BE SO CHARMING :) WILL YOU BE LONG? WE'RE ABOUT TO EAT. I HAVE TO GO LUÍSA. I REALLY ENJOYED SEEING YOU TONIGHT. YOU CHEERED UP A FADING PART OF MY BRAIN. They're edible, but don't eat them if you don't want to. - Sorry I'm late. - Man, we've already started. - This is Raquel. - My pleasure! I love your columns, always telling the truth and setting things straight. - We need more voices like yours. - Thank you Raquel, much obliged. - Did you bring wine? - Three glasses of whisky, imbibed. I think a sense of humour's so important. Laughing, that's important. A sense of humour's no good if no-one laughs. That's very true, too. A sense of humour serves no purpose, full stop. That's it's value. I've never thought about that, but it's true. I don't use Twitter much. - What's not much? - I don't know, maybe... Don't worry, no-one counts the hours they spend on Twitter or Facebook. - And you? - I don't like watching people satisfying basic needs, especially the most basic: pleasing others. It's like porn. So now you're against porn Helena? No, I'm for it, but only for good porn. I don't like porn. It's so cold. So Raquel, what do you do? It's a super special time for me, I've done lots of courses, had lots of invitations, mostly from important people. People with lots of projects who like my work. So it's great. - Interesting. - That's really interesting. - What is? - What you're saying. I honestly don't even know quite what I was saying. To memory. - To memory? - Yes, to memory. To Henrique Lopes de Mendonça. Who's Henrique Lopes de Mendonça? The man who wrote the anthem. Keep that memory stuff to yourself, no one wants to know. D*mn, anything but that. It doesn't matter. What? I want to know. - About memory? - Yes. "Reality only forms in the memory", Proust. Come on, no quotes, please. What's the matter with you? A catastrophe, perhaps. Here. I'M BACK. FROM WHERE? HELL. AND YOU, DID YOUR NIGHT GO WELL? I WAS WAITING. I DON'T LIKE TO KEEP YOU WAITING. PURGATORY IS BETTER THAN HELL. DO YOU HAVE SOMEONE WAITING FOR YOU? YES. IT'S A LONG, COMPLICATED STORY. IT'S BEEN LIKE THAT SINCE THE LAST TSARINA. ALL STORIES ARE COMPLICATED. BUT THEY HAVE AN ENDING. I NEED TO SORT THAT. Playing Rasputin? Odd you can bother with Twitter. You used to have a vacuity detector. I don't any more, as you can see. You used to be unkind, when you didn't feel like talking. You still are, that's good. I'm sorry, Helena, can you leave me alone? You're still not separating the trash? Morning. Don't you have class? The academic part of my Master's is done, I've said that like three times already. And yet I'll cause ecological disaster with my carelessness. Are you getting at the Master's, or it's just me? Sorry. But in my day, the academic part ended ten years sooner. I don't get the point of all this. Of neither the Master's nor ecological concerns. So now we don't go to Mass, we care about the planet. I was never a man of faith. SOCIAL NETWORKS DON'T IMPROVE PEOPLE'S LIVES. AS WE'VE ALREADY SEEN, ALMOST EVERY TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION IS A NEW WAY AND A NEW REASON TO GET AWAY FROM WHAT COULD GIVE SATISFACTION AND, OF COURSE, A NEW WAY AND A NEW REASON TO KEEP THE FOCUS ON ONE ANOTHER. SHALL WE MEET THIS AFTERNOON? SHALL WE MEET THIS AFTERNOON? So, what will it be? - The Pepper, please. - Pepper. The house norm is medium rare. It's a no egg chocolate mousse with crumble filling. Would you like to go out for dinner? No. I want to. Dress up, Helena, I'm taking you to dinner. Shall we go to that place you like uptown? Yes, let's go. WHEN WE'RE NO LONGER SEARCHING FOR THE MEANING OF THINGS, WE SHOULD PAUSE FOR A FEW MINUTES AND GO BACK TO NOTHINGNESS. IS THAT A METAPHOR? IT'S A TRAGEDY. IT'S NOT FAIR. WHAT'S NOT FAIR? THIS. BEING CURIOUS KILLS. LIFE KILLS TOO. LIFE'S IN LESS OF A HURRY. I WANT TO MEET YOU. LUÍSA, LUÍSA. SHALL WE MEET TONIGHT, AFTER THE SHOW? I'LL BE WAITING, JUST TELL ME WHAT TIME. I wasn't expecting this answer. It's already different. I'M PLEASED. BEING RECKLESS HAS ALREADY PAID OFF. Being part of one thing is not being another. It's being part of... I'LL LET YOU KNOW WHEN I FINISH. One thing... Being part of one thing is not part of another. - Shall we run do it again? - No, it's fine. There must be a misunderstanding. I'm being sincere, it's not funny, I like eating meatballs. My grandmother made delicious meatballs. I've never forgotten them. Of course, you had to talk about your grandmother. - What grandmother? - The moving grandmother. The rhetorical strategy that moves to tears. Don't play dumb. So now I can't tell you anything? Poor thing, now you're a victim of society, or language. For example, language is fascist because it makes us tell and I just want to speak. I don't want to say anything, I'm going to cry. Poor thing, I so pity the 60s. But I was born in the 90s. That's what you think. I want to say it, but you don't want to listen. Oh sure, of course. It's everyone else's fault, never mine, or is it me who doesn't know how to speak or says stupid things. Of course not. Others are always the problem. There's some big misunderstanding here. We're going for a drink. Are you coming? IN HALF AN HOUR IN SÃO PEDRO DE ALCÂNTARA GARDENS? Do you want to come? I'll call you tomorrow. António! António. António. - He reacted. - You'd better wait outside. I'll call my son. I want us all to be here. It's all right. The wise thing to do now is to wait and see how he progresses, before drawing any conclusion. It's late, Pedro. We have to meet your mother at the hospital. No, I'll go alone. But I can go with you. Stay here. There's no point you spending all day there. What happened? You were in an accident, you were very lucky. Lucky? That's him. He's fine. Your father's going to be fine. He's tough. It's not this that'll do him in. This what? The accident, Pedro. I was saying I'm sure he'll be fine, he'll get his memory back and physio will get him walking again. I'm curious, I'm finally going to meet Pedro's father. I've read his column and it's genius. He never saw himself as a grandpa, it'll be new. Your husband is conscious. He's had some loss of memory. We can't predict whether he'll ever recover it, or when. His motor function will return slowly too. We have to wait a while longer. So, António, have you had enough sleep? What day is it? I wouldn't know. Only prisoners count the days. - How long's it been? - It's been almost a year. Look, António, you've been very lucky. Lucky?! - Are you all right? - Yes. I'm still not used to this life. Me neither... seeing you with that belly. Is everything OK with Pedro? Yes, it's all good. A glass of wine please. F*k it, I want one too. It's Luísa, Pedro's girlfriend. What a delightful place for us to meet. How do you feel? Confused. And you, Pedro? You're going to be a grandfather. Sorry, I'm still not... That's okay, we have time. We should go. So António, how are you feeling? I'm ready to go to the slaughterhouse. You're doing well. It's normal that you don't remember the accident and that your muscles are weak. We can sort that with physio, - but that'll depend on you. - On me? You're probably depressed. We can give you light medication. Don't worry. I'm here to help you. We can also discharge you. You can come back for treatment, physio and such. You can be home with your family. No, I'd rather be here. Well, in any case, I'd like you to speak to a psychiatrist. Doctor, I'll do the treatment, I'll do physio and I'll let you know if I need anything else. Very well. You'll see. After this, you'll want to carry on exercising. I very much doubt it. Ok, lean forward. That's it. Inhale and back. Yes. Have you seen my cell phone? - No, do you want me to call you? - Yes. Here it is. Aren't you ready? We have to go. I spoke to my mum and she wants to go with you. She wants to do some shopping for her granddaughter. OK. - See you later. - See you. You're much better. How do you feel? Better. I'm sorry Helena, I know I've been impossible and you've been very patient with me. I'll bring you the newspapers. It's time you caught up and got back to reality. And Manel wants to visit. Bring me my music. You didn't visit your father. No. My mum likes being there to take care of him. Luísa. - To Dad. - To Dad. - Has something happened? - Yes, darling. Your father's finally asked for his cell phone and even wants Manel to visit. That's a good sign, but it might not be very good for him. Of course it's good, it's great. Tomorrow morning I'll give him everything. HALF AN HOUR FROM NOW IN SÃO PEDRO DE ALCÂNTARA GARDENS? I'M ON MY WAY. SÃO PEDRO DE ALCÂNTARA GARDENS IN 15 MINUTES? How is it man? Retreat over? No. You look great, man. I suppose now you'll say I've been lucky. What's up with you, man? Are you remembering sh*t? I don't need to. I mean, that it's not part of... not part of the process! What are you talking about? I'M AN AQUARIUM. SOLITUDE IS GOOD, BUT ONLY WHEN YOU HAVE SOMEONE TO TALK TO. LOOK AT THAT, NO PAST YET BUT NO FUTURE EITHER. Shoulder blades together, António. That's it. António, what's the matter? I didn't get much sleep. You have to take this seriously, this is a crucial step. They're all crucial. I'm tired. OK, let's try once more, slowly, no rush. That's it, slowly. Shoulder blades together. Hi António. Luísa. How are you? We're getting used to one another. - And you? - Yes. We met at a difficult time. I'm the difficult one because I'm fed up with everything. You're beginning a new life, one filled with promise. It's very scary. It'll always be scary. I'd like you to spend more time with us. But I understand... I'd be a nuisance. When dogs are old or sick, they like to stay away. Really, don't you feel better? Better than I'll be 20 years from now but worse than 20 years ago. It was an accident. We can't moan about what happens by accident. Is that the meaning of life? The meaning of life is like the hands on a clock, yes. Mine has no meaning at all, it goes where it wants. Don't fight it. It's Pedro, I have to go. How is Pedro? He wasn't ready for any of this, the responsibility... Luísa, I'm going for a drink with Zé, I won't be long. Pedro. Pedro. Pedro. Luísa. Hi António. Do you want to come in? We could still... Another day. I'd like to talk to you. Do you have time? Yes, of course. How did you meet Pedro? Pedro was on Twitter a lot, before we met. His profile is Rasputin. I fell in love with Pedro even before we met. We texted for a while. We'd arranged to meet the day you had the accident. - Where will you go? - For now, out of this house. António, look at you. I try not to. I forgive you. Forgive Pedro, he's your son. It's not easy being your son. F*ck Helena, f*ck it. F*ck, António. Hi, Manel? What's all this sh*t? It's what it is. António, I haven't known what to make of this for ages, but have you considered you might be off your rocker? Of course. You should be writing, I came to tell you that. Get back to writing, man. You had an accident, but you're better now. You have a great wife, Helena, waiting for you, your son, a granddaughter. Write, d*mn it. THE MEANING OF LIFE IS LIKE THE HANDS ON A CLOCK AND THE END OF LIFE IS DEATH, BUT WE DON'T KNOW IF THERE IS ANY PURPOSE. CROOKED LINES IS BACK. MARIANA, PEDRO'S FATHER IS WRITING AGAIN. I COULDN'T CARE LESS. TELL ME YOU'VE COME BACK TO LIFE. - Pedro should be here anytime soon. - That's good. I'm going to tell her. Don't you dare, António, I won't forgive you that. Some thing Helena won't forgive: confronting her son. Dad? You, here? You had disappeared. Why did you do this? - Don't complain. You have no right. - Why? - You want her to be happy? - And you? Did you make mum happy? Again, Pedro? Again what? It's not again, it's always, I'll always defend her. You never defended your mother, you were wretched. Get out. IT IS WHAT IT IS. YOU HAVE TO LEARN HOW TO DIE. IT IS WHAT IT IS. YOU HAVE TO LEARN HOW TO DIE. There's no point in giving meaning to life. Better to pay attention, be ready for where it takes us, accept when it goes badly and enjoy when it goes well. Really enjoy because life has no meaning but it does have a purpose: to keep going.
