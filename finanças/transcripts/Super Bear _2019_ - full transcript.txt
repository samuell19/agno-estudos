(SIGHS) You know Dad's wish? I wish... You were like a bee everday, just flying around! What, you, how can you say something like that? Where did you get all this stuff? If your mom was still here, she would... She would? You said my mom would come back when I grew up, where is she now? I'm going to find her! Where will you go? She's not coming back!

Go check the van. All okay. Let's go. (METAL THUDS) (PENSIVE MUSIC) Uh, boss? Uh, we got everything; well, almost everything. BOSS: Hmm. Hmm. (FOOTSTEPS ECHO) (BOSS CLEARS THROAT) MAN: Boss, this is very hard to get. Next time... Silence. There is no next time in my world. We either get the panda, or I'll put you in a cage and give you to the buyer. Yes, yes sir, of course, boss. - The Xu Wong Company. - Right. Its cover is a logistics company, but its actual business is smuggling rare animals. Animals and agents hate their guts. Their leader is called Xu Wong. (BABY GURGLING) The warehouse you said earlier... Before delivery, they hold all the animals in the warehouse. Nobody knows where it is. It's all kept secret. My owner and I tried raiding this place several times and found nothing. Finally, we spotted the location of the secret warehouse, so I know you're here to save your son. But entering the warehouse is very hard. Your son is definitely there. You're going to use your enormously big strength to help me sneak inside the warehouse. Only with my perfect plan and my high-tech kit can we save your son and the other animals. - But... - But you have to pass my special training. Then you can join me. Are you done, little dude? Wanna hear my plan? Huh? You have a plan too? - Let's hear it. - This is my plan. We get out of these stupid woods, then pick up my son from the Xu Wong Company. If anyone gets in the way, he can try my claw! (FRUIT THUDS) (DA XIA GROANS) (HUN TO CHORTLES) I see you've got a lot of courage to save the animals, but who knows if, aside from this brute force, you're only a rookie bear, a newbie. Humph. With what you've got, you'll just deliver your own death to them, and no coming back. Your problem is obvious; take this, start training immediately. You have a problem as well: you like to lecture people. I came all the way here not to listen to your nagging. My son is still in the snake nest. Goodbye. I guess you can't even escape from the woods! What should we do, Brother Xianxi? What should we do, huh? How about painting black eyes on me and putting me in a cage? Oh, alright. (SPRAY PAINT HISSES) (SQUEALS) My eyes! What do you think you're doing, you idiot? (LAUGHS) I'm coloring your eyes black! (GROWLS) Okay, I was kidding! That's enough, I was kidding; got it? Pull over, pull over, pull over! Hmm. This little bear. - Okay. - Let's take care of this. Paint this bear to look like a panda. Holy moly. (TENSE MUSIC) (SPRAY PAINT HISSES) You can't even get down from here, humph. I chased you down from the forest, how can I not get out of these stupid woods? What's so hard about them? (DA XIA GROANS) Do you think this little trick can take me out? No way. Huh? (LOGS WHOOSHING) (DA XIA GROANING) I'm already out. If rolling out counts. Listen, I do need your strong power, but you also need my plan and my training. Otherwise, we can't save our target. That is not how Xu Wong treats his guests. I'm here to protect you. You have to pass my special training. Only by working as a team can we save Xi Ha. My name is Da Xia. DOG: I am Agent Hun To. (LIVELY ROCK MUSIC) High climbing, focus. (TRAPS WHOOSHING) (FRUIT THUDDING) (DA XIA GROANS) (METAL CLANGS) You jerk! Leave my pigeons alone! (HUN TO YELLS) Last one, save the toy animals. Go, go, go! (KID LAUGHS) Wow. There's a giant bear! Oh, and a crazy dog? (BAT THUDS) BOY: Look outside. Look! (HUN TO WHIMPERS) CHILD: Oh, the puppy! (ELECTRONICS PRIMING) (EXPLOSION BOOMS) (CHILDREN LAUGHING AND COUGHING) Kids, is everything okay? CHILD: I'm fine, I'm fine! KID: You won't believe what we saw! I screwed up again. But you saved those kids. (DA XIA CHUCKLES) Tonight, we are going to save Xi Ha. Welcome aboard. (GATE CLANGS) (MONKEYS SCREECHING) (UNDERLING HUMS MELODY) (TIGER SNARLS) (LOCK BEEPS) Come on. Come on out here. Come on, little guy. (TIGER GROWLS) Looks like we're going to bring out the big gun here. Look. Here, yummy, yummy! (LAUGHS) Come and get it! (CHUCKLES) (GATE SLAMS) Yeah, take that. Stay there.

Tell everyone here: tonight, no one can make any mistakes! Yes sir! The final battle is tonight. Are you ready? What are you doing? What am I wearing? My fur got stuck. You're on my team and you're gonna act like an agent. It looks just like mine. This badge represents the spirit of an animal agent, who never gives up. Save my son? Give up, never! (TENSE ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) (ANIMALS GROANING) (GATE CREAKS) Hm. Hey, the boy is at the zoo, you know. Hi! Hi, panda! (XI HA CHUCKLES) What is your name? I am Xi Ha. I am Yei Yei. You are very cool. Yei Yei, let's go outside and have fun. Mm, I wish I could, but the cage is locked. (SUSPENSEFUL ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) Oh. Uh. Just open it! YEI YEI: If it was easy to open, we would have already come out. Are you hungry? I have some food. Looks like he won't be of much help. But he's outside the cage. Hmm. (CAGE RATTLES) - (XI HA YELPS) - Look out! (XI HA GROANING) (CACKLING) Look at his stupid face! (TIGER ROARS) Mr. Tiger, thanks for helping me out. Just call me Tai Hu. I am the leader of these poor animals. I apologize for the reckless behavior of Mongolia Wolf. That's fine. Mr. Tai Hu, I am Xi Ha. Da Xia's son; this little thing won't get me. Uncle Rhino, are you hungry? Would you like some food? Thanks for your kindness. I would like to leave the food to the little animals who need it most. Like your friend, Yei Yei. Huh? So we're friends! Cool! I have two awesome friends that will teach my dad not to spank me. (ANIMALS LAUGH) Xi Ha, we need your help. (INTRIGUING ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) HUN TO: Let's go. (DA XIA GROANS) (DA XIA CHUCKLES) Woo! (DA XIA YELPS) (SOFT THUDDING) (HUN TO GROANS) Tonight is a big night. Something seems wrong. The terrible snake nest. HUN TO: Come on, follow me. (GLASS SHATTERS) What's going on? (WORKERS GROAN) (DA XIA CHUCKLES) (ELECTRONICS WARBLE) HUN TO: Incoming, hide. (PENSIVE ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) (SQUEALS) A monster! Stay away! Stay away from me! (ELECTRICITY CRACKLES) (WORKER GROANS) Put on his clothes. Let's go in. This is our plan. Is this for real? Will you help us? (TENDER PIANO MUSIC) Sure. I will help you all. You have to be extra careful. If things go wrong, just give up. Protect yourself. Mr. Tai Hu, don't worry. TAI HU: What a brave boy. Xi Ha. Hmm. (TENSE, SNEAKY MUSIC) (ELECTRONICS WARBLING) There are two people out front. Get there as fast as you can. Take them down if you're exposed. Meet me at the cargo elevator. (WORKERS CHUCKLING) WORKER: Where do you think you're going? (DRAMATIC ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) I already won! Ha! (LAUGHS) - Let's go one more. - You can't beat me. (WORKER LAUGHS) - (WORKER YELPS) - And I broke your record. I can't find you boys anywhere and you're in here? Playing games and breaking records? Look at these temp workers, getting hands dirty and working so hard! - And look at yourselves! - We'll do better next time. - Two slackers! - Don't hit me! Next time? Don't tell me about next time! Never tell me about next time! Brother, brother! XIANXI: Where's the panda? Did you lock up? - The panda! - What? You are such an idiot! (UNDERLING BLATHERING) HUN TO: Nicely done. You look like a real agent. Huh? The tiger and the panda. Xu Wong is moving big time. Thank you. To save my son, you risked your own life entering this horrible place. I really appreciate it. Xi Ha will really like his cool uncle. Stop talking. Just stop talking. Let's just focus and save the animals. (SUSPENSEFUL ORCHESTRAL MUSIC) You stupid moron! I can't believe you! Can't you do anything right? You can't even lock the cage. Didn't I teach you? Huh, huh, huh? No, no! You jackass! Take this, take that! What? Stop, stop! Stop! (TIRES SCREECH) What did you do? What did you? What did you do? What did you do? (SOBS) What can we tell the boss? What are we gonna do? We're doomed! We're doomed! (SOBBING) UNDERLING: Brother, take a look. (XIANXI LAUGHS ANXIOUSLY) (KISSES SMOOCHING) (CAGE RATTLES) (EMPLOYEES CHUCKLING) Get out of the way! You almost ruined my big plan! (LOCK BEEPS) You make me always have to do everything myself.

(BLOWS THUDDING) (EXPLOSIONS BLASTING) (WORKERS GROANING) (LOCK BEEPS) (LOCKS BEEPING) Good job, Xi Ha. Once the door is opened, we can all escape together. (XI HA CHUCKLES) DA XIA: You were itching so much. When was the last time you took a shower? Password decoding failed just now. The virus invaded the system, and the itchy bomb exploded it. (SCOFFS) It was an accident. DA XIA: A scratchy accident. (LAUGHS) Don't you wanna go in? How can we match the right password? (ELECTRIC CAR DRONING) Oh, wait. You load the train first, I'll check things out. UNDERLING: Okay, Brother Xianxi. We've been working late all these days. When can we have a rest? Huh? Huh? Hey you! You, you, you, you, you! You were the tall guy who carried the case just now, right? (CHUCKLES) You performed well today. You lazy guys, get back to work! Hurry up! Come on! Hmm? Hmm? (SUSPICIOUS MUSIC) What is that?

Several days ago, we broke into the warehouse and almost saved all those animals, but I was exposed. My owner saved me, but he was captured instead, so. DA XIA: So, you managed to break into this horrible place. Where on earth is my son? Huh? He's in the warehouse. Da Xia, let me explain! Da Xia! DA XIA: Stop your nonsense. HUN TO: Da Xia!

HUN TO: Da Xia! - (HUN TO PANTING) - No! No! It was all your fault! (DA XIA GRUNTS) (YELLS) If you are also captured, there will be no hope for Xi Ha! (DA XIA PANTS) Follow me. We could turn to the agent for help. Then we can get the animals out, and catch all the bad guys! Forget about the agent! Forget about the plan! Today might be my last one, but I have to see my son! Da Xia! (DA XIA BREATHES HEAVILY) Da Xia, I... I shouldn't have trusted you in the first place. Pet dogs are full of lies! Only know how to use friends. Da Xia. Da Xia. WORKER: We need to find them!

It's all because you pressed us to run away. What to do now? My child! (SOBS) My... Xi Ha, sometimes we don't have an explanation, but we can't lose direction in our lives. Kid, if you do the best you can, miracles will happen. Maybe your father is trying to save us now. Wow. I believe my dad will come to save us. (TENDER PIANO MUSIC) (TIRES SCREECHING) Over there.
