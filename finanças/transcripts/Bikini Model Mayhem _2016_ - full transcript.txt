CYBORG HOOKERS Sorry. Is this seat taken? Now is. Please make yourself comfortable. -Thanks. Feet are killing me. I think of these shoes. They still look good, right? -Can't argue with that. All right. I like the man agrees. Whatever you say. -I'm Augustina. Bill. -Can I buy you a drink? Does frog has waterproof ass? I do not know, I never checked. Although I appreciate this attribute in a woman. Then it's your lucky day. Hmm, what will be cut? -Sex on the beach. I love it when you talk dirty. Fudge! -Wait a second. You did not ... -Queen of the night? Hardly. Why would you think such a thing? -Well, no offense, but someone like me could be the target of dirty tricks. I told you that I am not a prostitute. Someone like me should be cautious. A man like you to say ... -A man with enemies, political enemies, that are about to destroy and hamper at every turn. I can not let this happen. Well, that's unclassified world. What? -Unclassified. You know: every man for himself. -It is ruthless. Oh, there must be a minor bug in the program. And then a politician. I run for governor, ducks asleep. I can not afford to be caught in a tryst with a prostitute - undercover operation or not. What about you? What is your story? I am, what is known as a bikini model. My favorite kind. Hmm, now let me get that drink. Oh, I do not think it is necessary. But what about the prostitute with ass like a frog? It was 10 minutes ago. Let's go in the Wild West. So, what not? O, yes! I am, what is known as a bikini model. Yes, he already said it. Unclassified... Unclassified... Unclassified. Unclassified... Unclassified... Unclassified... I guess I had to ask her if smoke after sex. Hello. You're not a cable guy. -No. I'm Megan. -Joe Six Pack. I see this. And you're just the man I want to talk. Now it has women in Jehovah's Witnesses? I do not know the answer to that. I was campaigning neighborhood support on the governorship candidacy for senator Shubrashki. Shubrashki? Does not he run for governor? You're right. Registered voter or not? The only thing that vote is fantasy football. Well, maybe if you knew more about the positions of Senator Shubrashki. Play football? -His political positions. Are you interested? Of course, why not? Let's go back. I need anyway to wait for the cable guy. Unlike the other candidates in this race, Senator Shubrashki refused to pull dirty linen. I mean, he can point out that Mayor Jefferson slap wife and he embezzled millions from state coffers. A Stirling's received a diploma in law from a box of popcorn. And there are hard disk, which Vlado Kouzov might envy, not to mention his participation in the kidnapping of Lindbergh baby in, but it will be grave. Now, why should I believe any of these things? Because these topics for debate says it all. Let me without words. So, can senator rely on vota you? Not so fast. What will I bake? Higher salary? I do not know. I still hesitate. Lower taxes. -It's getting warmer. What about the government holds stinking hands away from your health fund? It all sounds really, really well. But I have some time before you have to worry about the latter. -Come on. The choice is clear. This is either the Shanagi murderer, kidnapper-buddy of Kouzov, which is experienced as a lawyer or senator G. U. Shubrashki, a true American patriot. Did I mention that you can keep your guns? I like the sound of that. There is only one more thing. -Yes? Can I look at your teat? Will you vote for Shubrashki? How is that? I promise. Something that can be saved? It's hard to say. -That was too close. Reassure only by the fact that Jefferson can not risk to tell what he knows without incriminate himself. Even so, we can not afford another failure. If I had warned the press to extramarital affair your opponents. My whole plan would cause the opposite effect. Whoever digs a grave to another alone falls in it, as they say. I know you scientists understand all of these things, but could you spare me ridiculous references to Star Trek? This is serious. -Oh, no doubt, G.U. But our situation would be far more uncertain if I had not noticed the malfunction in time failed to inform you of reporters. Correct. But you were the one who assured me that these so-called bikini models in the first place will work. Binary installation and kinetic integration of emerging intelligence. It is a delicate task. Was I not the one who cut research and development... Because haste my first bikini model into production. Augustina was just an early prototype with painful need fine-tuning. Brianna may share the same defect. I warned you that this can happen. Yes, yes, and then how to fix it? And by "we" I mean you. All of this magnitude requires a complex synergy. I'll start with an increase in system memory. But the cumulative domino effect is not something I can predict with a high degree of security. Give it to me in English, doc. I'll make the rest of our model bikini but there may be unknown risks. I will take the risk. Elections are very important to me. Have you been to try to win with your own qualities? Trying to win with their own qualities. Show me a bigger liar and cheater ... and immediately retreat. But with millions who pay me Wouldn't it be easier just to rent man of flesh and blood, who dial your enemies? And before we looked at this matter, Doctor. The real girls can not be trusted. What will prevent one of them to reach the tabloids and evaporating me for even larger sum? At least we can control the robots you. It was so humiliating. Barely able to look myself in the mirror afterwards. It's okay, honey. Do what you had. It is important to be chosen Senator Shubrashki. What has this to do with the election? I'm talking about my latest post on Facebook, she received only six likes. Your picture to dress in white and gold? It was black and blue. -Whatever. So you show teat of that pervert does not upset you? Country first, baby. This was my patriotic duty. Just do it in the name of the team, huh? Very clear. Are you okay? Look, you do not like to let him touch them or something? It was just a harmless little glimpse. And the truth is that a little bewildered. Here. Why do not you check to your siguren that are better? They feel like they are properly aligned and balanced. I believe the test drive is in order. All is finished. -Okay. If she leaves now, you can catch him before he headed home. No need to talk about me in the third person. Right here I am. -Got an enforcement order. I have. -Do you understand the mission? Unconditionally. -Okay. Go get dressed. So, you think will take responsibility? We'll find out in about an hour. Hello? So you managed to ride board? Clearly. Well done. I have to go. I noticed something while driving the headquarters of the campaign this morning, which requires immediate attention to me. What happened to the chief delegator? It is rather deal with active participation. Pamper them, girl! Yes, I will not fail. I'm here to see Mr. Stirling. -Do you have an appointment? Do I need one? -Yes. Can we make it about 3:00pm? -I'm afraid that this is not possible. It is engaged in the rest of the day. It was there that morning. I saw it on your desk. It could be registered in some way? Do not make me come over there and take it alone. OK. I'll be there in a minute. Can you wait here just a moment, please? I'll try to do it quickly. -No problem. I told you I do not want to bother me. See what you made me do? Hello. Now, how can I help you today? In fact, it is nothing. I can go back if you're busy. I'm at your disposal. -The secretary told you otherwise. Nonsense. What does she know anyway? It may need to take disciplinary measures. Can I offer you a drink? Drink what you drink, I suppose. Cheers. So how can you help? Well, really uncomfortable. But I am discriminated at work. Sexual discrimination? No, they still want to have sex with me. They simply do not allow me to dress the way I want. How so? They want to cover with big baggy clothes to not be distracted clientele. Nothing to distract? I do not know. Breathing, I guess. I can not help, if someone dropped dead of a heart attack when you lean over the fountain. The order had come. Few involuntarily nude does not matter, one way or another. Where exactly do you work? Pensioners Center "happy day". Mmm, this is a little delicate. But I will do everything I can to help you. All right. Now, can you help me demonstrate how lean, when this occurs unintentionally nude? Okay, but you have to sit down. The man was in a wheelchair. It was something such like that. Do you still breathe? Heavy. Do you see? They can not prove anything. This is the discrimination - plain and simple. Are you sure that the man was not behind you? Fairly sure. We will not leave no stone unturned. How so? It has never been better. So, do you think that we have a case? I think the ass is... The evidence is overwhelming. I would like to study it a little more closely. Perhaps to explore a bit, just to be sure. -This is some kind of legal jargon, or do you mean what I think you mean? Touch without his pants. Say cheese. Your wife may ask for photo portfolio. How dare you invade here without warning! This is a violation and invasion of privacy. I'm going to judge your ass, if you're going to fuck me manafite. We should talk about it. Maybe we can come to some agreement. Are you blackmailing me? -Hey, call it as you like. By the way I see it, I get the money to do photos. Now, the newspaper for which I freelance I would have paid a good price for this little fotoekspoze. But things in this business are already quite difficult. The budgets are just not what they were. Now, if emerge a better offer, I would be a fool not to take it, right? I mean, you would do the same in my shoes, if wearing shoes. -Have you considered the newspaper Weekend? Just trying to be useful. How? Ha, ha, now you speak my language, dude. These are processed topics for debate. They are Chief of Staff senator based on the latest data on polls. We will have to meet with them before we go purpose of calling again. This then is the test? Lots of funny. This is good news. So what's the bad news? What? Again? Well, well. Can we talk about this later? In the middle of something I am. Senator Shubrashki, what a surprise. -You must be Megan. How do you know? We never met. Anyone who works as hard as you not stay away from my radar too long. But just I started last week. -That's my point. Are you sure you do not confuse me with Ms. Morgenstern? Blue hair, walker, worked quite hard than I do. Do not ring the bell? Well, maybe I could introduce myself, guys. I think that would really get along. Take off your clothes. Excuse me? -Take off your clothes. All right. Senator? You want to introduce you to Ms. Morgenstern? I mean, I know it's here somewhere. She always. Unless campaigned neighborhood. It really moved on that walker. Perhaps another time. -Not a problem, really. It just would die if he heard you were in the building and meet you. –No, no, no. Well, read my lips. Another time. Friday may be better. -Whatever. I just wanted to come down here and to congratulate the whole great work that you did for us. Wow, I'm so flattered. Me, I do not know what to say. Say you will have dinner with me tonight. -Dinner? Is not this something your wife will be waiting, home with your family? Then call it a strategic meeting. -Can I bring a friend? Senator, what do we owe the honor? Oh, is this lucky? To tell you what, really do not have much appetite, but why are not you out tonight the two of drinks? I know a great "Happy Hour". As good as men. Now, before you send again we must be sure that your able to fulfill your obligations. Arise, please. Maybe you can be helpful. Yes, doctor. Stand against each other. Right? -Yes. Closer. Do not be shy. Augustina. -Yes, Doctor. I want you to seduce Brianna. Make her begging for more. Brianna, Brianna. Brianna? What is the problem? You want to set a record of Barry White or something? I'm programmed to regale, not getting it. But can you fake it? Every human woman knows how. But I did so only a member of the opposite sex. I, Augustina, and we are of the same sex - not that there's anything wrong with that. No, there is nothing wrong in my book. Well, let off steam. I guess you're the boss. I do not care what you do. I just need someone to be my backup. Wait a minute. Can you not give me a hard time? And... make it double. So what makes them do all afternoon? Oh, so they should be instructed and prepared to leave. Look, just send one of them. Better yet, send them both now. Important phone call? -Oh, you know how it is. Work, work, work... For the last topics for discussion there was about? Because I think there are some typos inside. Yes. New interpreted completely differently to old topics for debate. Well, I can not help if Jefferson stop slap his wife. Oh, this is actually still there. And new information about how he killed the man but your political positions have changed. So I've evolved. You can not blame me for this, Megan. But when your competitors do this, call it peel. No, I call it as I see it, until she sees it differently. Cheers. Come on. We have all night. But what about gay marriage? -Okay. Then to the bottom. So, the man... He tells me... He says... What he said? -I think he said: you drank too much. -No... I have to go to the bathroom. What? You want to fuck us? Of course. What could slow it down so much? Ha... maybe hollow. No, but he may have fainted. I worry about him. What if you hit your head or something? Would you like to go check it out for you? Oh, would you please? -Of course. I think you should come to see it with my own eyes. Brace yourself. This is not a nice sight. It is not suitable for you, Megan. You can do better. Let me take you home. No, no problem. I have the keys. We just need to be alone now. But... -No, really. It must handle this with my efforts. Thanks. There is always tomorrow, I guess. I was completely lost his mind. I should not drink on an empty stomach. And those girls, they attacked me. I was the one who was trying to start something. Well, certainly not try to stop him. Hey, they were sexy. What can I do? I mean not as sexy as you, maybe. But there were two of them and that should count for something. Yes, it makes your conduct twice as bad. You know how boys are. Sometimes thinking with his little head instead of big, especially when most were juiced with alcohol. How about juiced your little head with alcohol? You need somewhere to have a jar. Do not do as Anita Meyzer with me. I'm still not done just this. Well, maybe it is, just for me. Honey, do not even joke that will isolate me so. You know how I get insecure. Yeah, well, imagine how insecure You will be like a turkey in a jar on the shelf. You are kidding, right? Even column gone? Real fagots. Sterling is still in the race. Just like you said. -Well, you do not have it nagging. I have Mr. Wizard here for that. How can both attempts fail so miserably? It's not my fault. Presented is excellent, just as I was programmed. I know I know. Blame is human greed. What should you do your own robot reporters? It may take some time and it will cost you extra. It was a rhetorical question, you idiot! Excuse me. I have IQ 186. Oh, well, you win gum hair. -How eloquent. Hire speechwriter. I do not need to be eloquent. These authors speeches will become unemployed unless your shit is not working. -Here. Nagging me again. Bullying. What? Ask the authors of their speeches. And even I can not sip myself! So forgive me then? Only if you promise to keep the toilet seat down. Transaction. Which can tend to do anyway. I mean, without pissing turkey can be quite complicated. Baby no. You should not judge me too severely here. Let me rephrase. Well, you can keep it. But it remains in your pants for anyone else but me. Then let him go and let him breathe right now. First, we could take a shower. I know where was this thing. A true. Sorry. I'll be back after one song Napalm Death time. Do not start without me. You're in the mood? Oh, yes. The eye cameras will transmit live when they come to 100 feet from your goals. All right. This time will be successful. Well, one thing is certain. Despite the undeniable charms of our models bikini Jefferson and Sterling will probably not bite again. Lie to me once -Shame on me, lie to me twice. -I can not wander again. I myself I could not say it better. But I digress. The point is that we need new targets within their respective organizations. If we can take off their main political strategists this will necessarily have a negative impact on their campaigns. You're a tough guy, G.U. Shubrashki. Why, thank you. What is she doing here? You're the one who wanted to Piggy. Yes, but... You were right. Mike was inappropriate to me. I sent him good health. I need a real man. Man with courage and determination. Had you in mind someone specific? You, Senator Shubrashki. A man who knows what he wants and is not afraid to take it. Call me G.U. You want me, right? -You're quite lovely. Then take me! This is awkward. Would you mind? -Look. I'm glad you finally came to his senses. Me too. We must go. I invited a few friends. I hope you do not mind. No pictures, please! No sense G.U. Cum. Why? This was actually the idea of ​​Brianna and Augustina. I just agreed because I had already paid and anyway I've never been a big fan. Do not give me that crap. They are under your control. You're programmed them! He tells the truth. It was our idea. We grew to hate what made us do especially when Megan and Mike were involved. This was the drop that overflowed the glass. They were not politicians bottom, just innocent children. Little misguided perhaps, but innocent, however. The only mistake I made was to believe in you. What she said? I warned you that this can happen. But, but how? Fixing this bug in the program by increasing system memory give the models a bikini necessary tools to develop a moral conscience and free will. The IQ ​​can be very slippery slope. I guess I did not think without publican for the Governor's mansion. -Oh... I'm ruined! Schadenfreude? So what would you say to go tonight, girls? I agree. Not so fast. -I beg your pardon? He was not complicit in this whole thing? He made us do lesboseks. Not that there's anything wrong with that. It was all in the name of science. You were bottom pants and destroying the lives of people, including mine. Well, we all have our little faults. Tell it to the judge. -What? I think now you hear the train to depart. Schadenfreude. What about the government holds stinking hands away from your health fund? I know you scientists understand all of these things, but could you spare me absurd references to Star Trek? I'm Augustina. Bill. Can I buy you a drink? Does frog waterproof ass? Lie to me once -Shame on me, lie to me twice -I can not wander again. Okay, but you have to sit down. The man was in a invalid car. You should not judge me too strictly. Let me rephrase that. But what about prostitute with ass like a frog? Look what you made me do? Can I look at your teat? Subtitle by ISonIS
