Let me go! you know there's no escape, dont you? ok... ok... It was late at night and leaning against the side of a car I communed with the remnants of a bottle, without caring about the spring storm that was coming from the north, Let me! because I figured that in the state I was in things couldn't get any worse. I was the sort of guy, broke, homeless and without friends who always chases after lost causes with female names that lead nowhere. Mine was called Laura, and I met her many years ago. My world was a sick and pitiful world where trouble from a girl like that had to happen. It's been four years since I lost her and every time I smell jasmine on a passing girl I think of her and start looking for trouble again. And so, I got to where I am now. Only where I am now is a little strange because towards the back of the garden around an open hole two women are doing things which should have stirred me once, but with a bullet in one's shoulder, one can't do much. we will never go back again... we will never be in a place that I will fear less... You smoke too much eh? When you started it? But you could not stand its smell... It happened. Things happen. - Do our parents know? Why? Must they know everything? Whats the story with Maria? I learned that she dissapeared. You know buddy... You ask too many questions and I dont have so many answers. Dorothea told me that your brother came. Yes for Christmas. He'll leave in a week. And? And? What "and" Christos? He came. He'll eat some turkey, he'll drink some wine and he will go. Go fuck yourself! On earth as it is in heaven... Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our debts, And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Whats wrong with you? Why dont you speak? Talk to me. Niko's brother called me He asked about Nikos, for me, for us. Christos, what are we gona do? Dont be scared. Now we must not make mistakes. Whatever happens we will never go back again. Talk to Paulos to arrange a meeting. Well leave Myrto out of it. We are the two of us now. And perhaps Paulos. What are you doing here? We must talk. Its about Nikos. You know what happens around here... the subscriber you called has his phone closed Dorothea, did Petros called you? Did Petros called you? Dorothea, where is Petros? Why you didnt said anything? If you did anything to Petros Ill fuck you! Ill fuck you! young Nikos Avramiotis was found dead in his home today. His murder adds... ...to a string of grisly crimes... ...that for many months shock our community. I ask forgivness from everyone. For my Dorothea and the other kids. I didnt raise her to be a star in the news or a murderess. I ask forgivness from everyone. Will you make a statement? Will you make a statement? Back! Back! Why you killed them? Do you have regrets? A statement please. Why you killed them? A statement please. Do you have regrets? Death resides inside my empty eyes Love me and follow me I want to feel you so close, so far away...till Silence How I can tell you about what happened and what is going to happen... What is this thing called love? what is it? what is it? What is it that secretly drives our hearts With so much nostalgia? What is this thing called love? what is it? what is it? It's a smile, a tear, sun and rain... The end of the start of our lives. Never, never has a wise man found the answer and an explanation to give us yet. What is this thing called love? what is it? what is it? That makes us to sing the song I love you. I love you. I love you What is this thing called love? what is it? what is it? what is that gives you wings? and is sorrow together with joy... Never, never has a wise man found the answer and an explanation to give us yet. What is this thing called love? what is it? what is it? What is this thing called love?
