(Honking) (Boat honking) (Singing, indistinct) (Children shouting) - I have to go. - Mmm! Mm-mmm. Not yet. (Giggling) (Screams) (Gunshot with silencer) (Honking) - I propose a toast. To Graham, the last one to be bucked off the horse and the first one back in the saddle. - Thank you! - So tell us about your new job. - Really ? - Yeah. - It sucks. I sit there all day watching billions of pixels race by on the screen, trying to figure out which ones to grab to maximize our clients' profitability. - Sounds familiar. - Only now, knowing how bad the economy can get, it kind of... Well, it kind of takes the fun out of it. - Yeah, fiscal responsibility. I mean, who goes into investment banking for that? - Right. - So, how's Connor, Maren? - Working too hard. - Yeah, neglecting his beautiful wife, I'm sure. - No, not tonight. It's his birthday. - Whoo! What do you have planned? - Nice dinner, candlelight, champagne. - What are you gonna wear? - Wouldn't you like to know? - Actually, I would. I'm just saying. Look, Maren, if you were my wife, I would never be late from work. I'd be home every night in your arms. (Chuckling) - I know it's awkward me having a job and you guys still looking for work. - Hey, I'm enjoying unemployment. I get to be a full-time mom. - Uh-huh. - And I get to do all the things I never have time to, like tap class, art lessons, rock climbing. - Hold on. You're doing all that stuff? - No, but I have time to. - Good for you! I'm gonna get this. - Oh, you're too good to us. - Next time it's on me. - All right, see ya. Great to see you. - Oh! It was nice to see you too. (Man on CB, indistinct) (Woman on CB, indistinct) (Approaching siren) - Det. Fitzpatrick. - Solomon, I don't have all night. - Right. Male victim is Michael Hollis. He lived here with his wife and 2 children. She and kids are away in Florida visiting her mother. He was supposed to call them at 5:00 p.m. He does that every day when they're away. Um, when he didn't, and she couldn't reach him, she calls the neighbour, who comes over, discovers the bodies at 8:15. - Time of death? - Current best guess about 1:00. Looks like they were having a "nooner". - And the woman? - Anne Federman. She lived in Elmhurst. She's married. Uh, a daughter in junior high. Her husband's got a contracting firm on the island. - You've spoken to him? - Yeah, yeah. He's on his way in now to ID the body and Mrs. Hollis is on a plane from Miami. - That's an extremely clean cut. - It's almost surgical. - So the killer severed just the ring finger? - Just the ring finger. And his too. But whoever killed them... wasn't interested in the rings. (Dog barking) (Ringing) - Hi, sweetheart. - Hey. I won't be home for awhile. - How long awhile? - I don't know. We have an emergency appendectomy. I'm the only surgeon on duty. Don't wait up, OK? (Sighing) - All right. I'll keep a plate warm for you. - OK, thanks. Sorry. (Sighing) - Happy birthday. - Are you sure the name doesn't ring a bell? - No. She never mentioned Michael Hollis. - So you don't know how they met? - Obviously. - Did you know that your wife was having an affair, Mr. Federmen? - My teenage daughter is home alone. And I have to go and tell her her mother's been murdered. And then I have funeral arrangements to make. - We understand, Mr. Federman. But if there's-- - There is nothing I can tell you about what happened to my wife or the man she was with. I'm done here. - Mr. Federmen! Well... If my wife had been murdered, I'm pretty sure I'd wanna know why. - He said he was on a job site at the time of the murder. No one can corroborate that. Find out everything you can on this guy. Hey! Everything. I got it. -Hi. You're on Do Ask, Do tell. Who's calling? - Hi, Pamela. My name is Vickie. -What's on your mind today, Vickie? - Well ... frequency. My husband, he wants to... you know, do it all the time. - How often is all the time? - Every day, if he could. - How long you been married? -A little over 5 years. - Then you're doing something right, girlfriend. (Cell phone ringing) He's still interested. Thanks for calling. - Hello? Hey, Graham. Sure. Lunch sounds great. (Siren) - This place is fantastic. - Yeah. It's only been open a few months, but it's already a neighbourhood favourite. - Well, you look beautiful. - Thank you. Cheers. - Cheers. - So who's this client you're out here to see? - Client? Um... I kind of fibbed about that. You know, I was stuck at my desk and I was bored out of my mind and I had an overwhelming desire to, um, play hookey. (Laughing) - So you lied about having business in Brooklyn? - Yeah. Not here for Brooklyn. Here for you. (Chuckles) - I don't understand. - How are you? - What do you mean? - Ah, just when I look at you, you look like someone who's... lonely and frustrated. - Well, um... I'm not. - Really? - Mm-hmm. - Why are you still holding my hand? - Um... - Let's go to my place. - Graham! No. Stop. - Come on. You know you want to. - No, I don't. - Yeah, you do. All right. (Clears throat) I'm sorry. Came on too strong. Maren... Um... Whenever you're ready, I'm here. (Birds chirping) (Siren) - (Woman on PA): Dr. Davis, telephone, please. - Maren! Hey! - Hey. - What are you doing here? Do we, uh, do we have something today? - Maybe. - (Whispering): Oh, hey. - Mmm! Mmm! - Oh! OK, you know what? We've got to stop it. This isn't the time or the place. I'm sorry. (Sighing) - Then what is? Hmm? - Um... - You never touch me anymore, Connor. Is there someone else? - For god's sake, no. - Then what? You're not attracted to me anymore? - No, I'm-- I'm a surgical resident. I'm working. I'm working harder than I ever have, OK? And harder than I ever will again. Look... Oh! Look, Maren. We're fine. OK? I love you. And I'm sorry if I'm not the stud you'd like me to be right now, but I will do what-- (Pager beeping) But I am actually late for a staff meeting. I gotta go. I'm sorry. I'll see you tonight, OK? - Promise? - I promise. (Sighing) (Scoffing) - So Federman's ex-military. He's still in the reserves. He's an expert marksman. Belongs to a gun club. He owns over a dozen registered firearms. - No criminal record? - No. No, and there's still no physical evidence linking him to the crime. - Most people are murdered by someone they know, especially when infidelity is involved. - OK, so we've got motive, capability, and no alibi. - So let's pay him a visit. Meet me back here in an hour. - OK. You know, one thing still puzzles me though. Hollis and Federman's wife, they were from completely different worlds. How did they know each other? - That's a very good question. - Huh. (Dog barking) (Sighing) -You're on the air. Do you have a question for our guest, Brook McCall? - (Woman): Hi. Yeah, look. Let's get real here, Brook. Isn't your website just, you know, pornography? - (Laughing): My goodness! Not at all. - But you're selling sex. - We're not selling anything. We're a networking site. -Yeah, for sex. - Tell me, caller, are you married? - Yes. -Have you ever had an affair? - No. -Have you ever been tempted to? -Come on, now, caller. This is Do Ask, Do Tell. Be honest. - Well, yeah, once, but I didn't. I love my husband. - Well, Wandering Eye embraces both realities, that you can love your spouse but still need more. - Like sex with a stranger? - Not a stranger, someone who's in the same predicament you're in, someone who wants to preserve marriage they value but at the same time enjoy the pleasure of being with someone else. - You make it sound like there are no consequences. - Oh, there are. We help save a lot of marriages. - Oh, come on! -When you were tempted to stray, was it with someone you knew? - Yeah, a neighbour. - And that's probably one of the reasons, if not the reason, you didn't do it, right? - Well, sure. It would've been complicated. - That's why Wandering Eye works. We keep things from getting complicated. And that's what our members value most: discretion. - You ready? - We know how Michael Hollis and Anne Federman met. This is Hollis' computer, one his wife never used. I gave it to the geeks... (Chuckling) ...and look what they found. - What is it? - It's a website where married people meet other married people who want to get it on. - Wandering Eye. (Doorbell ringing) - Detectives. Can I help you? - We have a couple of questions for you, Mr. Federman, if--if that's OK. Have you ever heard of a networking site called Wandering Eye? - No. What does it have to do with my wife? - We found e-mail exchanges between her and Hollis on his computer through a Wandering Eye account. We think that's how they met. - Did your wife own a computer, Mr. Federmen? - Here it is. I found it yesterday. I didn't know she had it. - Were you able to read her emails? - Why on earth would I do that, Detective? My wife was murdered in another man's bed. I think the time to be the jealous husband has passed. I assume you need to take this. - Mm-hmm. - Yes. - Just be quick about it. My daughter will be home from school soon. - Mr. Federman, do you own a .38? - Is that what the killer used? - Do you? - They're all legal and registered. I assume you'll need to take this too. - That guy gives me the creeps. - He just found the computer yesterday? (Chuckling) That's convenient. We need to put a shadow on him. - Right. I'm on it. (People chattering) (Man laughing) - Alison? - Yeah. - Lucas. - Hi, Lucas. Nice to meet you. - Yeah, you too. Wow! You're even prettier than you said you were. - Oh. Thanks. - That sounded like a line, didn't it? - Uh, yeah. - I'm sorry. I'm just-- I've never done this before. That sounded like a line too. (Laughing) - It's OK. Let's face it. This is really weird. - Yeah. Definitely weird. - Yeah. - Um, what are you having? - Coffee. - A refill on the coffee and, um... a glass of white wine, please. - Actually make that 2 white wines. Thanks. (Birds chirping) - I love Blair. I really do. And I still want her sexually. Not if she doesn't want to be with me. And these days... I don't have to tell you, right? I mean, you're married to a doctor too. - Yeah. I couldn't believe it when I read your profile. I thought: "Here's my mirror image." - You wanna know the truth? The idea of having an affair, of being unfaithful to Blair, it depresses me. I mean, it feels like a violation of everything I believe in. - I know. When I said my wedding vows, I meant them. - But I can't stop thinking about being with someone else. Especially now. I checked in after I landed. I've got a room. (Sighing) - Not yet. - Sure. No. I understand. (Woman laughing) - (Man): The focus has changed. - So, I'm here the rest of the week. What do you say we just keep in touch and we'll see what happens? - OK. - And whatever happens or doesn't, I'm really glad that we met. - Me too. - I'm sorry. - No. (Chuckles) That was nice. Bye. - Bye. (Man on CB, indistinct) - Williamsburg. (Car door closing) (Doorbell ringing) - (Maren): Hello. - Hey. It's me. - Hey. Come on up. (Door buzzing) (Baby cooing) Oh! Mommy's here. Yeah, your Mommy's here. How was the movie? - I laughed. I cried. And it was short enough, I had time to get a manicure. - Nice. - And how did you two get along? - Well, she's not the most dazzling conversationalist, but I only had to change one diaper. - Only one? You're saving the best for Mommy, aren't you? (Cooing) Hey, that smells good. - Connor's actually gonna be home for dinner. - How are things with you guys? - Uh... status quo. - Hmm. Any word from Graham about openings at his company? - No, and I'm not gonna call him. I don't wanna give him the wrong impression. - Right. - Do you want something to drink? Water or anything? - No. I'd better take Her Highness home. - OK. (Chuckles) (Baby cooing) Bye, miss. Ah! Bye. Bye. (Baby whimpers) Ooh! - Thanks again for today. - Mmm! My pleasure. - I owe you one. - No, you don't. - Say hi to Connor. - I will. - Bye. - Bye. (Crickets chirping) (Sighing) (Sighing) Tsk! (Sighing) (Sighing) (♪ Classical music on TV ♪) (♪ Music stops ) (Sighing) (Beep) (Chiming) (Chiming) (Birds chirping) (Yawning) - Morning, Roberts. - Morning. - It's all yours. See you later. - (Man on stereo): ♪♪ Ooh ♪ It's irresistible ♪ It's another side of me ♪ Something takes over ♪ Desire gets stronger ♪ Where will it take me? ♪ It's scary... ♪ Ooh ♪ It's irresistible ♪ - Hey. - Hi. - Hi. How are you? - Good. How are you doing? - Good. (Sighing) - Ah! - What are you doing? Why are you following me? Hey, stop! Don't even-- - You're under arrest, Mr. Federman. - You're lucky our officer wasn't injured. - I'm lucky? - Why did you attack the car? - That's not the right question. - Why did you make an unprovoked attack-- - That is not the right question! The question is: Why are you following me? Why are you watching my house? - We're investigating the murder of your wife, Mr. Federman. - You think I killed her. You think I murdered Anne. - It is our responsibility to conduct a thorough investigation. - What is wrong with you people? I loved my wife. Do you have any idea what it felt like to get the call, to hear that she was dead, to see her dead and to know she'd been with another man? Annie was everything to me. I trusted her completely. And she died betraying me, betraying us. Can you imagine what it feels like... knowing that? Murder my wife! And leave our daughter without a mother? What kind of a person do you think I am? (Scoffing) - Why was there a loaded gun in your glove compartment? - I put it there the other day. They're here. You know that, don't you? Wandering Eye. Their offices are in Queens. I was so angry when I discovered the site on Annie's computer, I wanted to blame somebody for what had happened. I wanted to blame them. So I drove over there to confront them, to... I'm not sure what. I couldn't get out of the car. Couldn't do it. My daughter needs me now. She needs me so much. And it wasn't their fault. It was Anne's. - Would you like a cup of coffee, Mr. Federman? - What was that? Just an act for our benefit? - It felt real to me. - Yeah? Yeah, ballistics got back to us on his .38. It's not the murder weapon. - I'm gonna get him a cup of coffee and then I'm gonna let him go. - What about the attack on the car? Right. (Sighing): So... Back to square one. - Yep. - So, what about the wife? - The wife was 1,000 miles away. And I don't see her hiring a hit man. - A burglary gone wrong? - Nothing was taken. - Yeah, but they didn't get a chance to. - They had a chance to take the wedding rings but didn't. - That was a message. - Yeah, but what the hell does that mean? - Hmm... - You come here often? - Yeah, I always stay here whenever I come to New York. - Thanks. (Sighing) I would love a glass of wine. - Sure. - You don't stay here for the view. (Chuckles) - No, it's mostly out of necessity, being so close to the airport. I know that it's not in the city, but to tell you the truth, I really enjoy the quiet time alone. - Yeah, I know what you mean. - (Whispering): Yeah. (Exhales) You... are so beautiful. (Lucas chuckling) (Sniffling) What is it? What's wrong? (Crying) - Talk to me. - I can't do this. I'm sorry. I can't do this. I thought I could, but... I just can't. It's just... - Your vows. - Yeah. I can't. - Hey. What do you say we just get back to our wine? (Sobs) Huh? - I'd like that. I'd like that a lot. I should probably get going. - OK. (Sighing) Here, let me. - Oh. - Come on. Here. - Ah, thanks. (Chuckles) Oh! I have a confession. My name is not Alison. It's Maren Abbott. - Oh! - Sorry I lied to you. (Sighing) - It's OK. I mean, who knew what we were getting ourselves into here, right? I wasn't smart enough to use an alias. (Both chuckling) - You know what I think? - What? - I think your wife is gonna come back around. - Oh yeah? What makes you say that? - Women's intuition. (Both chuckling) Take care of yourself, Lucas. - You too, Maren. - Bye. (Sighing) (Beeping) (Sighing) (Shower running) - Maren? (Gasps) (Gunshots) - What you doing? - Uh, a little shopping. - At 3:00 in the morning? - I couldn't sleep. (Chuckles) - What are you doing up? - I was just gonna-- Just gonna go get some water. (Airplane flying overhead) - House keeping! House keeping! (Beeping) (Screaming) (Telephone ringing) - Fitzpatrick. Will? I'm all right. Look, why are you calling me? We haven't released that information yet. How do you know that? - Hey! I was looking for you. You talked to Ian Mankowitz? Homicide detective, Queens. - We went to academy together. - You told him about the severed finger in the Hollis-Federman case? - Well, we were having a beer and talking-- - A man was found murdered in his hotel room near JFK this morning. Mankowitz is on the investigative team. The lead investigator just called me. The dead man was mutilated in the same way. - No kidding. - Bring that with you. We're going to Queens. (♪ Rock on radio ) - (Woman on radio): In the news today, Queens police have not yet released the identity of the man whose body was discovered this morning at the Luxury Travel Hotel near the airport. But hotel staff indicated the man, an apparent homicide victim, was a frequent guest there. In other news, the mayor's office reiterated that-- (Siren) - There he is. - That's Will Atherton? He's the lead investigator? - Only in Queens. It's my case. - Still. Huh! That's the guy that caught the subway stalker, huh? - That's the guy. - What? You know him? - I was married to him. - He was shot at close range with a small-calibre gun. - .38? - Yeah, probably. The body was here overnight. He was killed yesterday afternoon. - Any sign of struggle? - No, he appears to have been caught completely off guard. - Maybe because he knew the shooter. - He was definitely with somebody. We collected 2 wine glasses with 2 sets of prints, One with lipstick traces. And earlier that day he was seen in the hotel dining room with a woman. Young, attractive, well-dressed. The wait staff couldn't tell if it was a business meeting or a date. She and the victim left together. - They presumably came back here. - Where they drank wine at noon? Sounds like a date to me. - Well, it didn't get very far. He was dressed. The bed was made. - You said he came here often? - Every other month, a week at a time. - Was he in the habit of holding business meetings here? - Not according to the staff. - That's definitely a date! - Was he married? - Yeah. His wife's a doctor in Ohio. Two kids. She's flying in tonight to identify the body. - So he's in New York on business, lonely, meets someone, invites her back to his room, and things go seriously wrong. - OK. So, other than the mutilations, what is connecting this to the Hollis-Federman murders? - Did he have a laptop? - Yeah, we've got it. Forensics took it back to the station. - I wanna see it. - You bet. Uh, let's go. (Man on CB, indistinct) - You look well, Jackie. - How's Patricia? - Look. I didn't ask for this assignment. In fact, I suggested they use someone else. But they want me, so let's make the best of it, OK? - See ya, Will. (Siren in distance) (Beep) - (Man): Luxury Travel Hotel. - Hi. Can I have room 411, please? - One moment, please. I'm sorry. Did you say room 411? - Yes, that's right. - May I ask who's calling? - Is there a problem? -Could I have your name, please? (Beep) - We found our connection. (Cars honking in distance) (Chiming) - You naughty boy. - (Girl): Mommy, are you gonna read me a story? - Mommy will be right in. - Hurry! (Keyboard clicking) - I'll show you naughty. (Chiming) (Chiming) (Chuckles) (Car honking in distance) (Chuckling) (Chiming) That was fast. Hmm! Can't wait. (Car honking) - (Woman): Queens police this morning released the name of the man found murdered yesterday in a hotel near the airport. Lucas Manning, age 34, was from Cleveland, Ohio, a pharmaceutical sales rep who was in New York on a business trip. His body was identified earlier by his wife, Dr. Blair Manning, the mother of their 2 children. No motive or any other details have been released at this time relative to the murder. It is not believed that Dr. Manning is a suspect. - You OK? - (Sighing): Yeah. I'm fine. - OK. Um, well, have a good day, OK? (Door closing) (Cell phone ringing) (Ringing) (Sighing) - (Woman): Well, yeah... - Brook McCall? - Yes. - No. No, I didn't know them, but then I wouldn't. We don't have any direct contact with our members. - Except when you bill them. - Actually detective, our memberships are free. We make our money from advertising. - Right. Sin sells. - You don't approve of my business. - Not when your members are turning up dead. No, I don't. - Det. Fitzpatrick, I'm as concerned about these murders as you are. But if you're here to take an adversarial position or to challenge the integrity of my business, we'll suspend this conversation right now while I call my attorney. - We have evidence that suggests these victims were killed by the same person and because they were married and having affairs. - What evidence? - I can't tell you. But there's no evidence at all that Lucas Manning knew the other two. The only thing connecting them is Wandering Eye. - That's disturbing. - The killer knew when and where the victims were gonna be, information he might have learned from their Wandering Eye accounts. - Do your employs have access to those accounts? - Not at all. Discretion is our stock and trade. - Then is it possible the site's been compromised? Hacked? - I don't know. - Who would? - Our head of IT. - I mean, nobody but me has access to this server. Like, nobody. I mean, I hardly ever go in. Uh, no, look. I mean I do, like, routine maintenance, but this system's rock solid. I mean, I just about never even have to go in, you know? Oh. Oh my god! - What? - Well, somebody has been in, like, a lot. Oh, they've been accessing our e-mail logs. - Meaning? - They've been reading our members' emails. - From inside the office? - Oh. Well, no, no. These are not our IPs. They're, like, from all over. Our security's been breached, like, big time. - So you're saying a lot of people breached it? - No, I don't--I don't know. I mean, it could just be one person from different computers. I just-- Oh, man! I just-- I can't believe this. - You have to talk to the police. - There's nothing I can tell them. - Well, they have to know you were there. People must have seen you with him. - It happened after I left. I don't know anything. - That's not the point. - It was a robbery. I don't know. Maybe he crossed somebody. - Maren! - It had nothing to do with me. - (Man): Sorry! (Sighing) - You think I'm horrible, don't you? - Stop it. - In a hotel with another man. - You know I'm not judging you, Maren. I just want you to do the right thing. - And what is that? Go to the police? Go public? Then Connor would know. - He'll understand. - No, he won't! Would Aaron? If you were in my position, If you had done-- or almost done-- what I had, would your husband understand? - (Man 1): Here, we'll help you. - (Man 2): Thanks. - (Woman): Here! - My passwords have never been cracked. Not ever. Not anywhere. - Is that the only way someone could've gained access to this server? - Yeah, I just can't believe it. - Systems get hacked, Zoey, even the Pentagon's. - The different IP addresses. Are they time-coded? Can we tell when the system was breached? - Yeah, and where from. Oh my god! What is wrong with me? I need to change these passwords! - We need to shut down the site. - We can't. There's thousands of members. - Any one of whom who could be in danger right now. - It'd be better if we didn't change the passwords and kept the site open. Don't alert the killer we figured out this piece of the puzzle Let's not draw any attention to Wandering Eye. Now that you know you've been hacked, do you have a way of monitoring future breaches? - I could set up a protocol so I'll be alerted immediately if anybody accesses it again. - That's what we should do. - OK... I need you to bring up the data on a member. Alison Rodgers. Lucas Manning had a date with her the day he was killed. - Sure. No problem. (Grunts) - I wish you hadn't told me. - I had to tell someone. - Why? So I could give you permission to just stay quiet? Really think about this, Maren. A man was murdered. - I know. I knew him. - Listen. I know that you're the serial-killer expert here, but I just wanna make sure that we're not making a mistake by keeping this site up. - We can investigate those IP sites and start busting down some doors, but my bet is they'll be cold. Someone with the capacity to crack server passwords is smart. We tip our hand, we could lose him. I say we catch him when he hacks in again, real time. - Yes, but what worries me is we have no idea what he already knows. There could be someone right now going out on a hot date, and they're walking into a death trap. - Shutting the site down now isn't gonna help them. (Siren in distance) (Car honking in distance) (Cell phone ringing) Yeah. - Hey, It's Solomon. I'm calling about Alison Rodgers. - "Alison Rodgers" is actually a pseudonym. She didn't enter any personal information except an email address. According to Wandering Eye's IT expert, it's a web-based account, so it's gonna be difficult to track the IP. I say, we send her an e-mail and see if she comes forward. - Yeah, we won't need to do that. - Well, why is that? - 'Cause she already has. - Hey, honey. - Hmm? - Looking for a date? - Maybe. How much? - Depends what kind of date you have in mind. - Get in. (Cars honking) - I don't know exactly when I left. Uh, around 1:30. - Why were you in Mr. Manning's hotel room? (Scoffing) -For the obvious reasons. But I couldn't go through with it. Still, I wanted to cheat. So what's the difference? - There's a difference. Was there anyone else there with you? - No. - Did you see anything or anyone suspicious as you were leaving? - Just the maid's cart down the hall. - Why didn't you come to us sooner? - I was trying to protect my marriage. - Do you own a firearm, Ms. Abbot? - No! I've never held a gun in my life. Why would you ask me that? - Well, you were the last person to see Mr. Manning alive. - No, I wasn't. The person who killed him was. (Paper rustling) - Do you know either of these people? - No, but I read about their murders. Why are you showing me these? - They met on Wandering Eye, like you and Mr. Manning. - I don't understand. Is there some connection between what happened to them and what happened to Lucas? - We think there is. (Kissing and sighing) - Mmm! Slow down, honey. You have me for a whole hour. (Laughing) - What the-- - What are you doing? - Ah, the hell with this! - You don't know who it is! It could be the police. Perry, don't! - Hey! You got a problem, buddy? 'Cause I got a problem. I'm trying to spend some time with my girl. (Gunshots) (Gasps) - Thank you. I knew that I was lucky not to be there, that if it were a robbery or whatever, I could've been killed, too. But... I had no idea I was a target. - So what do you think? - I think she's right. She was lucky. Damn lucky. - We may need to talk to you again, but you're free to go. - Are you gonna release my name to the media? - No. Since you used a pseudonym, the killer doesn't know who you are. Let's keep it that way. (Sighing) - Thank you. - Maren. You can still protect your marriage. You don't have to tell your husband. We won't. - I told them everything. - Good for you. - Now I owe you one. - For what? - Ah! Pointing me in the right direction. - You were already pointed there. You just needed a little push. So, did you tell Connor? - No. I don't think I'm going to. - Hmm? - I wanna put this behind me and... I wish that Graham would do the same thing. (Chuckles) - He's been calling? - And texting and emailing. - Oh! - He's beginning to feel like a stalker. - Well, you're a hard woman to give up on. - Yeah, right. (Both giggling) (Baby crying) - Oh. Duty calls. - Ah! - Atherton. - (Fitzpatrick): Wandering Eye has been hacked again. We're on our way with SWAT. - I'll track down who the targets were. - Clear! - All right. What now? - Get Will on the phone. He's trying to track down the Wandering Eye members that were hacked from this address. - Yeah. - Hopefully he had better luck than we did. - Hey, it's Solomon. What's the word? All right, we'll meet you there. - He found them. - What? - He found them. - A hooker? - Guess again. Driver's license in her purse says this is our girl. Minus the red wig, Brenda Sheppard-Bates. Got her name from Wandering Eye. M.O. matches the other murders. - Brenda Sheppard-Bates. The real-estate developer? - Yep. This is his wife. - What? Turning a trick? - Acting out a fantasy. - That would be my guess. - All right. So who's he? - Perry Annunzio. Book publisher. Worked in midtown. - Stick around. Let me know if forensics comes up with anything. - OK. - You got it. (Woman on CB, indistinct) - We have to let the media in on this before they connect the dots. (Sighing) (Beep) (Cell phone ringing) (Sighing) - Hi, You've reached Maren Abbott. Please leave a message at the sound of the beep. (Beep) (Sighing) - Can I get another? (Cell phone ringing) - Yeah. - Hey, it's Solomon. No luck. Forensics came back. Zero trace of evidence. - OK. We're on our way back. - All right. - We have to issue a statement, control the rumours before the media does it for us. And who knows? Maybe someone will come forward and-- 'Cause right now we got nothing. - You're right. - And we have to shut down the site. - Yeah, you're right about that too. - Good. (Cell phone beeping) (Sighing) - Come on, Graham. Give it up. - So here's what we're going to release to the press: "We believe the same person is responsible "for the murders of Anne Federman and Michael Hollis "in Manhattan, "and Lucas Manning, Brenda Sheppard-Bates "and Perry Annunzio in Queens. "All of the victims were members "of the social-networking site Wandering Eye, "which has today suspended operations. "Other than acknowledging that commonality, "we are not releasing any further information "concerning the murders at this time. "What we do want to emphasize "is that the general population has nothing to fear. "These murders are not random." OK. We're about to start the press conference. - OK, great. Zoey's ready to shut down the site. I'm waiting for your call. - OK. OK, let's do this. - Jackie! Don't. - Here. - When did you get this? - Uh, about an hour ago. - You don't know the sender? - No, but it's the killer. - Why do you say that? - Who else? - He got your email address from Wandering Eye. - Now he wants to blackmail you? - No, he wants to kill me. I'm unfinished business. The one who got away. - She's right. This isn't about money. This is about restoring moral balance. A common link in all the murders is that the male victims were fathers with young children. I think the killer suffered the trauma of divorce as a kid, because his father was unfaithful. - So he couldn't kill his dad or his dad's mistress, so he's killing surrogates. - Where better to find them than Wandering Eye? - Only he didn't kill this surrogate. Look, he's seen me at the hotel. But he doesn't know who I am or where to find me. He's trying to smoke me out. - Yeah, but does he really think you'll fall for a blackmail threat? - He assumed I'd come forward, but I didn't. Or he thinks I didn't. - Which is why he didn't contact you sooner. - As far as he's concerned, I'm desperate to stay anonymous. - OK, so what do we do? - We give him what he wants. He wants to smoke you out, we let him. - (Fitzgibbon): We can't ask her to do that. - Fine. - You would be putting yourself at risk. - But you'd be there to protect me, right? - Right. - So why don't I answer his email? (All talking) (Inaudible) (Inaudible) - OK. It's show time. You ready? (Sighing) - I keep thinking about Blair Manning, Lucas's wife. Did you meet her when she came to New York? - Briefly. - She thinks her husband cheated on her. But he didn't. He really loved her. - We'll be watching you at all times. - OK. - He's not gonna do anything in public. It doesn't fit the profile. - Then why am I wearing a bulletproof vest? - You can back out. I wouldn't blame you. - No. Let's do this. - OK, so once we have him, you go straight to the alley. behind the restaurant. - Got it. - OK. - OK. - Good evening. - Hi. Table for two. I'm meeting someone. - Right this way. - Here you go. The waitress will be right with you. - Thank you. (♪ Lounge ) (Inaudible) - (Hostess): Is everything all right over here? (Laughing) - Alison? - Derek? - Hands on your head! I said hands on your head! - You're under arrest. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can be used against you in a court of law. - I haven't done anything! - You have the right to an attorney. If you cannot afford one, one will be appointed to you. Let's go! - (Derek): What are you doing? - We're sorry, people. Police business. Please stay seated. Everything is under control. (Cars honking) (Man on CB, indistinct) - Williamsburg, please. - I'm telling you I didn't send any "pay me or else" email! - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sit down. - How did you know to meet Mrs. Rodgers tonight? - We exchanged e-mails, but not at that address you said. - I've got my phone in my jacket. Check it. By the way, she contacted me first. She emailed me. - You're claiming you and Mrs. Rodgers had a relationship? - No! She was interested in one. That's why we were meeting. - We got the wrong guy. We've been set up. (Sighing) - We gotta get a patrol car to Maren's. - Guess who. (Gasps) (Exhales) - What are you doing? - Uh... Do you wanna go to dinner? What was that-- What was that place that we went to for lunch? - Go home. - Hmm? (Laughing) - Go home? Aw! OK. Just one little kiss first. OK? OK? Just one. - You're--you're drunk. - Let go of her. Let go of her now. (Grunting) Are--are you OK? - Uh, yeah. - Guess again. (Siren) (Line dialling) (Sighing) - Hi, You've reached Maren Abbott.... - She's not answering. (Beeping) Yeah. Is she there? - No. All I found was a friend of hers, Graham Ball. Sent him to the hospital with a minor head injury. - All right. Thanks. The killer has her. - What? - Where are we going? - Hmm... You're not very romantic, are you, Alison? No basking in the afterglow for you. No pillow talk. Just wham, bam, thank you, man, and you're out of there. And poor Lucas. Hmm... Had to die all by himself, and that's not fair. Turn right at the light. Damn it! (Sighing) - Where is she? Will, where is she? - He has to finish what he started. - What are you doing? - Yeah, it's Atherton. I need backup now! Luxury Travel Hotel. Let's go. - OK. Got it. (Siren) - You made a promise, a promise before God, and you broke that promise and that's a grievous sin. Did you think it would go unpunished? Did you think that God would, like, look the other way? It doesn't work like that, Alison. - So that's why you're killing people? For God? - Don't reduce this to simple! Nothing is simple! Life is complicated and that's why we need to help each other. - So why don't you help me and let me go? - Right. See, I was gonna help people. See, I--I was gonna be a doctor. Like him. See, he encouraged me, even when I was really little, let me read all his books, play with his medical instruments. And then he ruined everything. - The hotel! You're taking me back to the hotel. - Someone should've killed him, too, him and his whore. Go around the back. (Siren) (Tires squealing) - You're gonna kill me, aren't you? - No. You killed yourself, Alison, the minute you slept with another man. Park anywhere. - I have something to tell you. - What are you doing? What are you doing? - My name isn't Alison. - Stop the car! Stop it! (Airplane flying overhead) (Approaching siren) - Hey! Hey! Over here! Hey! - Maren, what happened? Are you OK? - I think so. I don't know. It wasn't Derek. (Gunshot) - Aaah! - Zoey! You don't have to do this. We can get you the help you need. - I'm not the one that needs help right now, Detective. (Tires squealing) (Grunting) (Groaning) (Whimpers) - Ah! You keep your vest on. I'm calling for help. Don't move. I'm right here. (Will groaning) Everything's gonna be fine. - Oh! - Let me see, let me see.. Luxury Travel Hotel. Officer down. Let me see. You're gonna be OK. (Groaning) - It's OK. Help is coming. (Groaning) (Man on CB, indistinct) - (Man): Was hell of an accident! - Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. Flesh wounds hurt. (Sighing) - You saved my life tonight. - We both got lucky. - No, you had my back. - I've always had your back. - Not always. - I fell in love with someone else, Jackie. It happens. (Sighing) - Yeah, I remember. - Come on. It would've happened to one of us. We were lousy together. - Yeah. I remember that, too. (Groaning quietly) - I should hand in my badge. How many years have I been doing this? And it never occurred to me the killer was a woman. Not once. - I'd like to go home. - Yeah. Yeah, of course. Sorry. Gonna be OK? So, you're still anonymous. You don't have to tell your husband, OK? - Yeah, I know, but... I'm going to. Our marriage is in trouble and it's never gonna survive if it's based on lies. - Uh... - What's this? - Lucas Manning's wife, Blair. That's, uh... That's her number. - Thank you. Take care. - Yeah, you too.
