THE STEADFAST TIN SOLDIER There were once 25 tin soldiers. All brothers, for they all came from one old tin spoon. Shouldering arms, eyes front. They wore splendid red tunics and blue trousers. The first word they ever heard, as the lid was taken off the box was: "Tin soldiers!" It was a little boy. He had been given them for his birthday. Each soldier was the very image of the other. Except for one who was a little bit different. He had one leg, for he was the last to be made and there wasn't enough tin. Still there he stood as firmly on one leg, as the others on their two. And as it happened, he's the soldier this story is all about. There were a lot of other toys on the table. But the one you'd notice first was a beautiful castle. Through it's tiny windows you could see right into the rooms. In front of it were some small trees standing around a little mirror. Wax swans reflected in it as they swam. Everything was very pretty. Yet the prettiest of all was a little lady who was standing at the open door. She was wearing a skirt of the clearest muslin, and a narrow blue ribbon - - with a glittering spangle in the middle. She was holding both her arms stretched above her head. She had kicked one of her legs so high in the air that the Tin Soldier - - imagined she had only one leg like himself. "That's the wife for me", he thought! "But she lives in a castle." "I've only got a box, and there are 25 of us to that." "That's no place for her. All the same, I must see if I can't get to know her." Then he laid down behind a big box. From here he could keep his eyes on the elegant little lady. Later in the evening all the other tin soldiers went back into their box, - - and the people in the house went to bed. And now the toys started to play games. Visiting, fighting, dancing. The tin soldiers rattled in their box, because they wanted to join in. The Nutcracker turned somersaults. The Slate-pencil had fun on the slate. There was such a noise that the canary woke up - - and joined in with some twittering in verse. The only two who didn't budge were the Tin Soldier and the little dancer. She stood perfectly upright on tiptoe. While he was just as staunche. He's eyes never left her for a moment. Suddenly the clock struck twelve, and the lid blew from the big box. "Tin Soldier, will you please keep your eyes for yourself!" But the Tin Soldier pretended not to hear. "All right, you wait till tomorrow!" said the Goblin. And when tomorrow came and the little boy got up, - - the Tin Soldier was put away by the window. And whether it was the Goblin or the draft, the window blew open - - and the soldier fell out, head first. It was a terrible fall. The maidservant and the boy came down. But they never saw him. If only he had called out. But he didn't think it would be right, as he was in uniform. Now it began raining. More and more heavily. It was a regular downfall. When it was over, two street boys came by. "Gosh, look at that!" said one of them. "There's a tin soldier!" "Let's send him out for a sail!" So he put the Tin Soldier aboard a boat made out of a newspaper. And away he sailed down the gutter. Bless my soul! How the waves rocked and what a strong current there was. The boat bobbed up and down, and whirled so fast, he became quite dizzy. But he kept staunch and never moved a muscle. He looked straight ahead and still shouldering arms. All at once the boat drifted in under the broad culvert. "I wonder where I'm coming to now?" "It's all the fault of the goblin." "If only the little lady were here. It could be twice as dark, for all I care." Just then a great water rat appeared who lived under the culvert. Show me the passport! Stop him! He hasn't paid the toll. He hasn't shown his passport! The current grew stronger. The Tin Soldier could see daylight ahead. He could also hear a roaring sound which could be a dismay to the bravest. It was no stopping. The boat dashed out, spun around - - and filled right up with water until it was bound to sink. The Tin Soldier was now up to his neck. The boat sank deeper and deeper. He thought of the little dancer who he would never see again. And the old song rang in his ears: "On, brave warrior, where death awaits thee!" All of a sudden he was swallowed by a large fish. Oh, how dark it was inside. Even worse than it was in the culvert. The Tin Soldier was still staunch, still shouldering arms and lay at full length. The fish started about, making the most terrifying twists and turns. At last it lay still. A light flash went through it. And someone called out: "A tin soldier?" The fish had been caught and sold - - and here it was in the kitchen. The maid carried him into the parlour where the little boy wanted to see - - the extraordinary man who had been travelling about inside a fish. But the Tin Soldier thought nothing of it. He looked around. And there... Well, what wonderful things can happen! He found himself in the very same room as he had been in before. The same toys on the table, the same castle with the pretty little dancer - - who still stood on one leg and kept the other one high in the air. She too had been staunch. This touched the Tin Soldier - - who could have wept tears of tin. He looked at her and she looked at him but neither of them spoke. Suddenly the little boy took and threw the soldier straight into the stove. He had no reason for doing this. Surely the Jack in the Box was behind it all. The Tin Soldier stood in a complete glow. The heat was tremendous. But whether it came from the actual fire or from love, he had no idea. He looked at the little lady, she looked at him. And he could feel that he was melting. But still he stood staunchly. Then a door opened. The draft caught the dancer. And she flew like a sylph right into the stove to the Tin Soldier, - - flared up in a flame and was gone. The Tin Solider was melted down to a lump. And when the maid cleared out the ashes - - she found him in the shape of a little tin heart. But all that was left of the dancer was the spangle. And that was burned as black as coal. THE END
