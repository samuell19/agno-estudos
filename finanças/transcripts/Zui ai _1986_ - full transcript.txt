"Passion" You remember that guy? He in the real estate business. Last name Au Yeung John used to be his lawyer His first divorce was handled by John too This is his second wife I heard he's getting divorce now Is that so? His present wife should be younger than us But she looks older than her age maybe she's not very happy - Now he has another affair - He's really something It's just because he has too much money! Men can take that as an advantage. When they're rich, they can replace their wives for someone younger. But you're quite well-off too! Dr. King passed away long time ago Have you ever thought of remarry again? Never, and you? That's different, John passed away only a year That's different to say As for old man, I won't be interested Young man will not be interested in me, too You like something to drink?

Put the ring on Ming's finger Well, what a great evening Miss Ku's very clearing and smart No wonder John doesn't want her to be his secretary And wants to change the terms at her contract And to bind her for the rest of her life.

He waited until Wendy came these few nights Your dad was very nice to me when he was going after me Remember my words The man relationship be it husband & wile or friend. One has to be very careful. Auntie! You look great today! Is that so? You are home? No, I just went to an interview. An interview? What interview? For a job in an Advertising Agency You got it? Don't know yet! Mommy!

I'll be right back, bye-bye! You forgot something? Ming went home, she'll be right back. Come in and take a look at your new bedroom. Wendy! What's the matter? Did you ask me which side is my real self? I thought for a long time, I find it so funny Why? Everyday, I solve so many problems for people However I can't make my own decision. When I was a kid, everyone said I was a good boy. When I grow up, everyone said I'm a nice guy They even said I'll be a good husband. I'm getting used to it I don't have courage to got what I want I'm already 30 years old. Do you think I should got something that I really want. How should I answer you?

There's something you can't remember There's something you don't to remember. It seems I'll never ask you about John. He's gone. What's the point of asking? That's why should ask now that he's gone Once he dated you did you accept...? I heard it's 8:00 p.m. right? It's long time ago, don't mention it. I just want to know who that you've accepted him? No! No? Yes! But you know he's my fiancée... Why did you still go out with him? Ming, let the bygone the bygone Besides, I didn't interfere with your marriage. Fortunate!
