In 1536... fleeing from the Inquisition, the alchemist Uberto Fulcanelli disembarked in Veracruz, Mexico. Appointed official watchmaker to the Viceroy, Fulcanelli was determined to perfect an invention which would provide him with the key to eternal life. He was to name it... the Cronos device. 400 years later, one night in 1937, part of the vault in a building collapsed. Among the victims was a man of strange skin, the color of marble in moonlight. His chest mortally pierced, his last words... Suo tempore. This was the alchemist. The authorities located the residence of the dead man. What they found there was never fully revealed to the public. After a brief investigation, the mansion and its contents were sold at public auction. Never on any list or inventory was the Cronos device mentioned. As far as anyone knew, it never existed. MERRY CHRISTMAS Sit up straight. GRAND BAZAAR ANTIQUES Here. Go through these. Only a few days left. Tickets are running out for the big New Year's dance... Excuse me.

Early in the morning At the break of day Open up your little eyes This one is still missing. Put them in groups, by size and shape. If you provoke them, it's worse, Aurora. De la Guardia Enterprises.

And... the new draft of your will, ready to... Shhh! Why do you always have to be so noisy? Just sign the new draft of your will. I have news for you. Our buyer just called. Papers. - Thank you. - Now tell me, what did our buyer have to say to you? Oh... same old thing. I found another archangel. So what are you waiting for? No, not this time. This time you get somebody else to pick up your garbage. Not everything is garbage. No, not that book again. This is not garbage. I know they all look the same to me. That's part of the problem. Open your eyes. Look. This is different. This one will be mine! Lovely day. Good morning, sir. Are you looking for something in particular? Pricey. It's unique. Yeah, sure. They all are. But... then, It's not my money. Keep the change. I'll wrap it for you. I love these mirrors. You want it? Yes? No? Yes. May I ask your opinion about something? - Of course. - And yours too. Very "importante." Very important. - Do you like this one? - No. No. - How about this one? - No. - And this one? - That one. Which one? That one. You like it too? Thank you very much. You don't know how important this is to me. A present. And thanks to both of you. Good luck. No, honey, it's not chocolate. Something like this happens once in a lifetime. Once in a lifetime. Well, nothing happened. Look, it's funny. What do you think it is? A toy? Stay away from it. Don't be scared. Get me a box. One, two, three. And one, two. One, two, three. Now, listen carefully. This is seven in four. We'll start with this leg, Manuelito. And one, two, three and four, five, six and seven. One, two, three, four. Don't grunt, Manuelito. - Excuse me. - And... And now, the finale. Good afternoon. Where did you fall down? On some broken glass. - You won't need any stitches. - Ouch! Men are such whiners. Do you remember when Blondie March died? Everyone was soaked in blood and she was clean as a whistle. But dead as a doornail. There's something in there. This will hurt. Thanks for letting me know. I almost got it. It was buried deep. - What is it? - I don't know. A metal filing. No, it looks more like a stinger. From a bee. I don't know. Please, please. Be very careful. I beg you, please. Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass against us. No. I'm okay, darling. I'm okay. Good morning. - I'm reading. - There's too much light. It's incredible, you know? Baby Vizcaina died at 92... Do you like it? No. You look... different, a lot younger. Exactly. That's the point. That's how I feel. Where's Aurora? - Don't you want breakfast? I'm not hungry. Hey, do you like it or not? - Yes, I do. - Good. I'm glad. DE LA GUARDIA ENTERPRISES ANGEL DE LA GUARDIA Hi, Mr. Gris! How are you? Okay? You destroyed my shop! I'm not the one you want to talk to. The red ones are especially good today. You don't know what you're getting yourself into. Almost 40 years ago, I found this manuscript. Forty years. They are the notes, the inscrutable writings of a 16th-century alchemist. It's a fascinating text. It's written backwards, in Latin. It describes a very peculiar mechanism, an invention that prolongs the life of the person who uses it. But there are rules, precise and very strict rules about its usage. - An insect? - That's the stroke of genius. An insect is trapped in the device. It's like a living filter. You think so? I mean, after all these years. Who says insects aren't God's favorite creatures? Christ walked on water, just like a mosquito. The matter of the resurrection is related to ants, to spiders. They can remain inside a rock for hundreds of years until someone comes along and frees them. Of course. All of this is very enlightening, but why tell me? I'm dying, Mr. Gris. I'm going to show you something. The scalpel has been eating away at me bit by bit. Chemotherapy, radiotherapy, psychotherapy. Look carefully, my friend. Half of my body is here, in this case. And the other half is already on the menu... or is being devoured right now, while we talk. No! That's mine! You used it? You used it? - It was an accident. You fool! Angel! Here I am, Uncle. Here I am. Oh, Mr. Gris. My uncle is getting impatient. De la Guardia! We both have something to lose. Mr. Gris? You may continue the game. After all, you have the toy. But I'm keeping the instructions. And I won't relent. Impossible. I put it here, damn it! Aurora! My God. Aurora? I know you have it. Aurora. Aurora? Are you scared? Do you think something will happen to me? Are you comfortable back there? This happened to me once before, with your dad. Do you remember him, even a little bit? Yes. I would imagine so. When he was your age, he overheard someone talking about people who die of lung cancer. So when I got home from work, I found my cigarettes had vanished. After looking all over, I went in the bathroom and found many little bits of tobacco. They were floating in the toilet. Just little bits. I think he understood later that destroying my cigarettes didn't help matters at all. But at least, I understood that he was worried. And he understood that I had understood. You know what? I don't know what's wrong with me. But I think it's best if we're together. - Jesus. - Just a minute. - I need your help. - Just a minute. Hurry up, darling. We're going to be late. Who are you, little one? A god? You're very good for me. I don't know why this dress doesn't fit. I wore it for last year's dance. I'm almost ready. How could I change so much in so little time? Do you remember? Do I remember? My love I can't believe it's all over And life has separated us Do I remember? The first time I saw you, I thought you wouldn't give me the time of day. I felt so small... That's what architects call vectors. - That's amazing. - That's it? The small parts always support the large ones. - But what holds it up? - It's not a play on words. The pillars... - Teacher. - I'll be right with you, Manuelito. - Cheers. - Cheers. What's wrong? Is something wrong? - I'll be right back. - Where are you going? To get a drink. It's hot. This always happens to me. - Are you feeling better? - Yes. Every time I drink, I have to pee. I've been listening to this music since I was a little boy. What a fucking decadent party. Really. Give me a fucking break. Look what they did here. The party got crashed by some Argentinean or a Peruvian, shit. You break your back all year long to go to a nice party... Fuck. I'm leaving. Nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, HAPPY NEW YEAR - TIGERS CLUB two, one!

Mrs. Lupita Raquel sends everyone her wishes for glory to God in heaven, peace on earth and goodwill. How beautiful. You. Happy New Year. Tell me where it is or my uncle won't leave me alone. What is it exactly... this thing? What the fuck does the old man want with it? He never told you? You all think I'm stupid, don't you? He thinks it will help him live longer. That fucker does nothing but shit and piss all day, and he wants to live longer? Leave me alone. Do what you have to do, but leave me alone. Of course, sir. I will leave you, when... and if... it pleases me. Get it? Get up. Get up! Fuck! Fuck! So quiet. My God, so much blood. All that blood is mine. I'm dying. Unbelievable. Everything's upside down. And I'm dying. Alone. Don't let me die today. I'm in so much pain. I can endure a lot more. A lot more. Oh, Aurora. Wow, Tito. Wow. The forehead is turning out... perfect. It looks totally normal. It's your best work yet. - Fuck, yeah. There's a technique to this. I'm giving it shape, texture, color. You have to be a fucking artist. Yes. But don't go to so much trouble. We're going to cremate him. What? Fuck me! What do you mean we're going to burn him? You should've told me before I fixed the fucker, God rest his soul. Nobody respects my work here. Why didn't you guys let me know? You! Why didn't you let me know? The widow changed her mind. It looks like the guy didn't make preparations. He didn't buy a niche, or a grave plot, nothing. They're all the same. The bastards think they'll live forever. Plastic surgery, contrary to... Fuck. - Yes, Uncle. - Get up here immediately. Stupid motherfucker cocksucking son of a bitch... asshole pendejo. - I want to know what happened. - I'll be right there. Shit. I can't blow this. I didn't touch him, the car skidded. - Went off the cliff. - You imbecile! Uncle... What about his heart? What about it? Did you hurt it in any way? I told you I didn't touch him! His car skidded, it went off the cliff... Did you check his heart? It wasn't beating. Did anything accidentally pierce it? What's the difference? He's dead. It makes all the difference, all the difference! Oh, you clumsy beast. You can't do anything right. After all these years I thought there might be hope for you. But you're useless, useless. You probably ruined the whole thing by now. How can somebody be deader than dead? You know nothing about dying. I don't understand. No, you don't understand. And you'll remain that way. But there is one last thing you still have to do, and you better do it right because I'm not going to rest till I have what is rightfully mine. And neither are you. Look at that. Was it a lively wake? We won't send you to heaven like this. Naked, with lipstick smudges all over. They'll think you went whoring. Here you go, buddy. Come in, sir. Come in. Make yourself at home. Tito, Mr. De la Guardia is - was a friend of the deceased. He wants to see the body one last time. Of course. Medium or well done? Ohh... HE ISN'T DEAD HE JUST LEFT EARLY THE FAMILY OF JESUS GRIS THANKS YOU FOR BEING WITH US DURING THESE TRYING TIMES Hello? Yes? Mercedes. Is that for me? Dear Mer... cedes. It's very hard to write these lines to you. I want you to know that, somehow, for some reason, I'm still alive. And being alive is very painful. I'm burning with thirst. And everything feels foreign to me, the day, this house... and you. Aurora will stay with you. She will leave you this letter. By the time you read it, I will have gone to a kind of appointment to resolve unfinished business. If I've lost everything, at least I'd like to know why. Just today I realize how much I miss you. I hope to find you here when I come back, willing to see me, regardless of my appearance. Love, Jesus. Aurora. For God's sake, what are you doing here? I told you not to come, Aurora. Put that away. Don't you realize they could kill us? Don't you realize we're in danger? It works. I knew you'd be back. If you're looking for the missing pages, you're wasting your time. I ate them. Best meal I've had in years. You talk about eternity. Look at me, look at my skin. It's rotting. It's falling to pieces. Peel it off. What? What are you talking about? Look. What's happening to me? You've been reborn. What the fuck is it now, you dried up old prune? Why is this happening? Why this new skin? And don't answer with riddles! You talk about insects, about alchemists, about devices. But what am I missing? Blood. Human? Of course. You can't gain eternity with a cow or a pig. I can break the device, smash it to pieces. As you wish. If the device goes, you go. But... we can share... eternity. I don't give a damn about eternity! I don't want to live forever. I just want out of this. That's even better. There is a way out. But first, the device. I don't trust you. I don't think you have a choice. Give it to me, darling. Give it to me, I know what I'm doing. But first... my way out. As you wish. You don't even bleed right. And now the heart... My God, Aurora. Uncle? Talk to me... Let's go, okay? Let's go. Please. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Mine, mine... everything is mine. Mine, mine, mine. Angel. Enough. You kept me waiting long enough. You... Fuck... not my nose again. This has to end. Oh, Mr. Gris. now I have to kill you again. Mr. Gris. Go on. Go on! Come here, precious. Come here. Angel! What the fuck do I have to do to kill you? You've got more to lose. For me, it's just pain. Get ready for some more. What the... Grandfather. No! I am Jesus... Gris. Jesus Gris.
