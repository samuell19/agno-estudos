Well, no, I kinda thought, maybe, that you would... What? Be a little bit more proper? More like what a mother or a wife or a school board member should be?

And yet, here I've ended up in bed with 3 of you. Yeah, that's real funny. You can scratch one of the 3 though. Ooh... Are you gonna start tellin' me what to do now? When it comes to the old man, I'm gonna start tellin' you what to do. Oh, yeah? And what should I tell him? "Gee, I'm sorry, speck. I'm switchin' to your famous son." I don't give a shit what you tell him. I don't even know why the hell I'm here. Did you know this was gonna happen? Yes. How? Why? Because you didn't get enough when we were in high school. You left, but you didn't finish. So, you're really just gonna go out and have lunch with Alice? Right now? I don't see why not. I like Alice a lot. One of the things I like best about her is the way she handles you. Well, you're not gonna say anything about the way you just handled me, are you? I imagine I'll listen to her talk about how moody you been lately. How ambivalent you are about your music. Stuff like that. Now, Alice has to live with you full time. It's a lot different from a little frolic. A little frolic? And that's what this was, was a little frolic? A frolic's a frolic. Although, you know what they say? You never quite get over your first love. Yeah, well, what about speck, then? What the hell does all that mean? Oh, speck doesn't mean. Speck just is. What're you gonna tell him? I'm not gonna tell him anything. You want him to know somethin', you tell him. Nobody ever controlled you, and nothin' ever stopped you. I was your girlfriend for 4 years. Some of that was bound to rub off. You got what you wanted by doin' exactly what you pleased. Now, I may not get exactly what I want, but I'm not gonna be bored. In this town, that takes a certain talent. Yeah, well, it wasn't just a little frolic. It was definitely more than just casual. Lots of folks gonna be hurt by this, besides me and you.

I thought things were goin' so good we'd just move in here or somethin'. And think of all the money we'd be savin'. Think of the money we might lose if you stop performin'. Or think of the money that I might spend if I get bored with rural life. Which I did several days ago. I might start buyin' furs and stuff, like your mother. Know what I mean? I'm slowing down. I guess I don't need to remind you that you start recording in a week. Bud, music has gotten you everything you have. Even you? No, not me. Higher. I guess it was your cheerful, upbeat personality that won me over. Push me, mom! If you're gonna quit the music business, just do it! All right, I will. Bud, what're you telling me? That you're never, ever gonna sing again? No, what I'm tellin' you is that I'm tired of goin' out every night, makin' a monkey out of myself. Ok, fine. Stay here and work for speck.

You hitchhiked out of here, remember? Your father didn't even like your music. He crushed your guitars. He didn't give you a cent. You didn't grow up here! Growing up is exactly what you didn't do here. You grew up in L.A. and Nashville and New York. I mean, if you stay here, you're just gonna end up just like your father. Oh, great. Well, that's a great thing to aspire to, isn't it, bud? Girl, what in the world is goin' on with these fingernails? It's a hillbilly manicure. I just bite 'em because I'm nervous. I worry all the time. What do you got to worry about? I got lots. My mother's an alcoholic, only she won't admit it. My dad's taken up with this old slut from bedford. Takes all his money and don't care nothin' about him. Well, then you got ramey. Don't mention him. I'll finish off my fingernails and start eating my hand. I ain't seen him for 2 days. Hmm. Where you reckon he goes? Louisville. Maybe. Roller rink. I don't know. Well, when we get done with this hair dye job, maybe I'll go out and look for him. You wanna go along? No. He'd think I was checkin' up on him, and he'd quit me in a minute. If it's you, it's different. You're the only person in the world he even respects. You won't regret it. I hope not. Trust me.

What is it you want? I want you. I thought you wanted me. Of course, I do. You are the main love of my life. Yeah, well. This love don't seem to be affecting your life the way it's affecting mine.

Either I'm more important than a damn school board meeting or I'm not! Why the hell are you actin' this way? I would have married you, bud. But you never asked. You just left. I would have gone with you, but you never asked that either. You left me here to make my own happiness. And I did. So, this is just an affair for you? I didn't say "just." This isn't just an affair. This is the best affair I'll ever have. But you're married. And I'm married. I don't see you for months at a time. Maybe you got a girlfriend, maybe you don't. I don't know. I don't care. But don't criticize me. P.j. Where you goin'? You seem to think that because I like sex, I'm irresponsible or somethin'. But I'm not. I worked hard to be a member of the school board, and I do a good job. P.j.! What would you say if I said I wanted to marry you? Did you hear what I said to you? Yes, I did. I was gonna be nice and pretend I didn't hear you say it. That proposal's about 16 years too late. Look, why would you want to tear up your nice family and tear up my nice family to do what we can do anyway if we're smooth? Smooth? Hell, I hate smooth. Well, I'm afraid that's not a very good prognosis then, Mr. Parks. Because I'm about as smooth as they come. Not that you'd give a damn, but I'm thinkin' about leavin' this town anyway. That'd be a pity. Yeah, you'd live, wouldn't you? Yes, sir, I would. Ramey, what the hell's goin' on around here? You guys movin' or somethin'? Followin' your example, bud. You left, now we're leavin'. Where you gonna go? I don't know. Probably Colorado. Linda's got folks out there. I don't get this part! Hey, it ain't complicated. Hey, you left. Man, we ain't gettin' nowhere here. I'm tired of bein' the...The leftover parks boy. Man, I'm goin' somewhere where they ain't heard of no parks. Except you.

You got a mouth like a slop bucket, junior. I don't remember invitin' you to sit down. Well, I thought we could just have one of them heart-to-heart talks, pa. Well, I don't particularly care about your heart. No, you ain't particularly cared about nothin' about me, have you? Nope. You were always the runt of the litter. I tell you what I am interested in though. I'm interested in all that money you make. I thought someplace along the line you might send me a little bit of it, but you never have. Give you some? Well, I mean, the credit ought to go to the sire. That's the way it is in horse racing. Yeah. Every time I was tryin' to be somethin', you was right there to cut my feet out from underneath of me. I was just tryin' to teach you to be a man. Playin' music in a honky tonk ain't work. No, but it sure enables me to make all this money you're so interested in. Well, I understand there's a lot of little black boys who make more money at it than you do. Yeah, well. Next time you come sniffin' around the old lady here, you're gonna look a damn sight worse than you do right now. Now, don't say I never did anything for you, kid. I just bought your breakfast.

Alice just drove up. Are you leavin'? Oh, she's your wife. I imagine she wants to talk to you alone. I'm gonna say this just once. Then we're not ever gonna talk about it again. I'm gonna keep you in my heart, bud, just like I always have. Hi. Hi. I'm glad you're here. That's hard to believe. You didn't even call me. I was scared. Tryin' to buy a little time. Time for what? I don't know. How's Terri Jo? She misses her daddy. Alice, why'd you come back? Goodbye's don't make you gone, bud. If cutting somebody loose were that easy, then nobody'd care about a soul. You know, when our marriage was good, it had originality. People are so mysterious, bud. It's a great feeling to think that you actually know somebody in this world. That they've shown themselves to you. And I don't think I could ever be as curious about anyone as I am about you. Thing is, bud, you can't have some secret life in your head and then another one on the street. When you tell people what you really want, it's gotta be the truth. Could you do that, bud? Could you find some unafraid way to tell the truth on yourself? All I want is the first thing that comes from your heart. Say, "I love you, buddy." Say, "I love you, buddy."
