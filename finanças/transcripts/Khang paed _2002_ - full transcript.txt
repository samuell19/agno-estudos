"Hello, Yingsak speaking." Let's talk later. See you. Hello. What's this? I've told you I won't take a call. I'll be there. "Chaiwat, please chair this meeting." "Mother, where are you going?" I'll be away upcountry for "a couple of days, children." "Aunties, please choose any bedroom." "My dear son, there're two things" I'd like you to do. Keep my body for just three days. Then cremate it along with your two aunties'. Discuss this with Payome. He knows everything. Float our ashes altogether. Don't keep them. "Call my friends, their names are in this letter." Invite them all to the cremation. Their numbers are in a book on my desk. I'm leaving everything to you. Do what you want to. I love and trust you always. Let's sprinkle flowers and perfumed water again. "Auntie Malee, please be first." "Dow, if you see Pen, tell her I miss her." "Sis, you think like me." "But between us, who's gonna be next?" "I guess it's probably you, the oldest one." When did you get that awful sense of humor? Since I chose a business tycoon instead of a poor writer. "Lucky for her. Otherwise," she'd have starved to death. "Jaturas, let me be last." I think Dow would rather rest with this beside her. "Butterfly in Gray by "Dowsawai Paijitr" "Make yourself at home, please." "Would you like a drink, uncle?" How about a beer? Suits this weather. Are you the same Mr. Payome who defended Dowsawai in court? She used to mentioned you. "Yes, but I'm no longer an attorney." Now I own an orchard not far from here. What would the cremation be without you? They've got nobody else. I've just found out my mother was famous. She's in all the papers. Kids nowadays are like this - - never take an interest in their parents. What do you mean? Maybe I'm too old-fashioned to understand the new generation. "Uncle, may I ask you." "The novel"Butterfly in Gray"'," and the pictures taken in front of the prison "and at the party," were they very important to my mother? Didn't your mother tell you anything? "If she did, why would I ask?" Sometimes I felt very strange. It's like I wasn't her son. My mother never told me much about herself. "Only one time, half teasingly, she asked me" what I'd say if I learned she was once in prison. What did you say? Is it important? I'd always love my mother no matter what she'd been. Love alone isn't enough. You should know more about your mother. Excuse me. You're beautiful. Got a date? Wat's taking me out for dinner. Are you sure this is the guy? Haven't you heard about the occupations a girl shouldn't trust? "I'm university graduated, dad." I think I won't make a bad choice. "Hello, sir." In full uniform? Just off duty sir. I gotta go. Guess I'd better go. Dad would be waiting. I'll take you home. You need not. I can go by myself. See you. Hello. "Dow, I'll be away on duty today." Be back tomorrow evening. What about our appointment? It's important. Let's meet tomorrow. Okay. Bye-bye. You're crazy. What if your girlfriend comes? You're crazier than me. "Don't worry, though. I've handled that." No! Dow. Listen! Convict Dowsawai Paijitr "and convict Pak Plangnual, ma'am." "When I speak, never look away, understand?" "Yes, ma'am." The worst failure of all you inmates is in understanding human languages. You read all the rules but wouldn't understand and wouldn't follow. "If you don't want to die here an old inmate," "or die before that from unknown causes," go ask the experienced ones how they manage to live in here there're no deities for you to ask for mercy. "If you want that, come see me here." Go! "Pen, take care of the new ones." "Yes, ma'am." Your place is in front of the can. "Joy, watch them." What are you looking at? Never seen one pissing? You'll get used to it. This room's members won't get out easily. Not like in foreign movies. "Don't make problems," and keep a good eye on your belongings. Thanks. How can they stand the smell? We'll get used to it. It comes from us "here anyway, nobody else." You can move further away later. "For now, you newcomers belong here." My name is Joy. Mine is Pak. I'm Dowsawai. "Never mind, having come this far," it doesn't matter where we'll sleep. Shut the fuck up would you. "Try to get some sleep," every which way you can. Soon it'll be dawn. Another day's awaiting. Hey! I haven't washed my crotch. Saving it for what? "This is a flooded country, bastards!" Stop bathing. Go turn on the water for me. "How about eating at my house, sweetheart?" What are you looking at? "Unless it's necessary, don't go near her." And watch your tongue and pussy too. I've no idea what you're talking about. What a waste of schooling! A slap on your face and you'll understand. Are you threatening me? Please don't mind her. She's still like a child. Just like my daughter. "After eating, go see the boss." "Yes, ma'am." I've warned you. It's up to you whether you believe me or not. "Hey, I dreamt of my man last night." Did you do it with him? How many times? I had a dream too. But my bastard's "a sleepy head, he didn't do anything." "Convict Pak, you used to be a nurse?" "Yes, ma'am." The infirmary is in need of assistants. You go there. "Convict Dowsawai, you're good looking" and well-educated. Never experienced any hardship for sure. You go work in the kitchen. "Yes, ma'am." The work starts tomorrow. Don't go fooling around. "If the boss sees that," all of us will be in trouble. Not asleep yet? Wish I could be turned off like a T.V. I'm worried about my father. Stop! You'll get me pregnant. Let me go! No! Your daughter must be examined at the hospital. An officer will take you there. It's by the book. The suspect has his rights to be bailed out. And the case must go to court. "I'll leave this to you, Lieutenant." It's your daughter! Why did she do this? The court hasn't passed verdict yet. "No! No! My daughter, my daughter." Are you OK? I'm alright. It was just a nightmare. Quiet! The kitchen staff are awaking. "If the boss hears the sound," you two will be in trouble. Hurry! What you're doing there? Do it fast! We're gonna eat early. Is that ready? You take care of it. Hurry! Take your time. You can't roughen your hands quickly. Now go get the rice for me. How dare you are! Think you can get away with it? Harder! Harder! You got it! "That's for you, bitch!" You got it! There! No! I'm giving you three days. Pay me back or be ready for things harder than my hands. So it's my sweetheart. No one dares turn around while I'm speaking. "But for my future housekeeper," it can be forgiven. My ears are not always good. "When they're good, trouble follows." Looks like you're asking for it. You need to be both deaf and blind if you don't want trouble. I told you my ears are on and off. "Hey, who's causing trouble here?" Want purgative in your food? You know what this big knife's for? It kills baddies! "How was it, sis?" I'm lucky. They're short of staff. "Normally, you need connections" to be assistant there. I have none and also just got in. And you? I'm using none of the things I've studied. "Hey, off!" Dow! No! "Mother, help me. I was wrong." "Everyone else, sleep!" You're dragging others into trouble. You know that? What's going on here? Put them in solitary. Now! It's my fault. Joy hasn't done anything. Shut up! "This cell is jinxed. Once in," you're bound to return. Joy. I'm sorry I caused you so much trouble. "In here there're no future or past," only the present. "Once it's over, it's over." "Wait, sis." I'd like to grow a Pimsen mango tree. Right from a sapling. Who said I could get it for you? It's you who taught me that I should learn to observe things. But why must it be a Pimsen? I'm like a Pimsen. I wouldn't trade myself for salt. That's why I'm in here for homicide. "A nice change, isn't it?" "You don't pay the rent," you can't be in the house. A house? I long thought of this place as a prison. For you it can be free. But you have to move in with me. I like something hard. That soft wet tongue of yours can't satisfy me. "Besides, I never stay at" other people's house. "Convict Dowsawai, there's a visitor." Go. I'll eat in the hall. Are you O. K? "Yeah, I'm fine." "You look ill. Heartsick, isn't it?" My husband's just died. Had he been promoted to a general? Yeah. I thought I'd always do well being a general's wife. Even if only one among many. Good. Don't ever become a whore again. He must have set aside something for you. How are things with you? Simple. I've everything but still lack something. Now I understand nothing is as important as love. "Tell me, why didn't you choose him?" He told me being a writer is like being a whore. "Once you can't write, you're finished." "Can't blame him, though." It was my own choice. Sometimes I'm too scared of life. "Dow taught me," "No matter how bad the pain is," don't ever let anyone see it. How are you? "Not bad. My feet touch the ground," my eyes see the sky. And I can have kids without having to get pregnant. I'm going downstairs to see if I can stir up an old flame. Watch out for those stray ashes. No good for your age. "Auntie, please keep uncle Yingsak company." I'm going into town to do some shopping. Beer so soon? Nice breeze. Good weather. Why not? How is your writing? I'm still a fan. But I can't follow everything. Too busy. "In "The Life and Times of a Whore", whose life was it based on? In your past lives you must did a lot for whores. Now they're your friends. Me? I'm like a worn-out prostitute. Wants to quit but can't. Who's the whore in the book? I'll never tell you. How is your life as a tycoon's wife? Do you want the long or short version? Wait. I'll get a beer first. Me too. I forgot my cigarettes. Why didn't you tell me he's coming? "You don't own me, you know!" "To me, he's as special as you're." That's why I let him come in here. "Him special, why?" All men are alike. Want everything for themselves. "He's a customer just like you," more special than others. "A different kind of special from you," but I won't tell you how different. I'm entitled to some privacy too. Even though I'm just a... Why don't we live together? "Hey, you can make your" inviting sound sweeter. A writer shouldn't speak so bluntly. But it did sound sincere. I really meant it. Good! Then it's time to speak up. We like each other and should meet whenever possible. I think it's better like that. I'm not talking about money but about people in your society. Others don't know who I am or what I do. Could you stand it if they did? I don't need to be a university graduate to see that. How the hell did you become a writer with this temper. "Aroon, Yingsak. I just ran into Dilok." Quiet! Or the neighbors will cuss your mother. "Or if you'd keep your mouth shut," you might look prettier. Never mind. The Devil drilled open her damned mouth at birth. "Yingsak, let's go and talk in my room." Ah hah! Aroon. Stupid! I know the rules. This is a house and not workplace. "Sorry, sis. Just kidding." What a headache! She doesn't know whether to have a business man or a writer. Can't beat me. I'll never choose any man. All men stink. "Once I've saved up enough," it's good-bye. I'm fed up with them. Even though I've never been with anyone for a long period of time. But why are you interested in others' affairs while that toy boy of yours is cheating behind your back? How do you know? I'm not stupid nor blind. "At your age, without a young boy" "to arouse you, you'd rust." "And without it, now you'd become withered." "You bitch, get off!" I think we're better off this way. This room is always open for you. And I'll never leave you. I'm not afraid of that. I'm only afraid that you'll move in with him. You woke up so early. We'll have rice congee today. "Aroon, who won last night?" "Whose side did you bet on, lad?" I'd bet on the heart. An old man and his money? No. Have you ever met an old man who can get it up every day? Most young men can only boast about it. "Oh, forget it." "Aroon, are you free today?" I've already a date with Dilok. "Wow, the old man scores again." Looks like he's ahead of the writer. Sis. "You fool, why do you" have to act so tactless? How many times have I taught you? Why can't you give it to me some other time? I just want to show how honest I am. "The work's done, the fee's paid." "O. K., Miss Goodie-Goodie, sit down." You take Aroon's place "tonight, a new customer." He's about your age. You might meet your match. "I've never run off. Except if he's drunk," or takes me to a motel. They're all dirty. "But hey, is he handsome?" Handsomeness takes you nowhere. "Let say he's loaded," pays well and right away. "Plus, he has class." "Having known me - Mama Malee," Have I ever disappointed you? "Dow, you can speak too, you know?" Malee won't ask you for a cut. "Lad, you mess with everyone." "Mama, what's the rush?" A date with the boy? That's Mama's business. Not yours. "Sis, are you busy?" Come on in. What's it? Why are you showing me these beauty-salon photos? Do you think I want to be a whore all my life? I didn't mean that. Help me. I'm afraid of being cheated by a beauty school. Are you and Malee related? Why don't you go and ask her? "If I did, she'd kick my ass" for being too nosy. "So, are you being nosy?" "Sis, that's a bite." Forget it. What about you? How did you come to live here? Mine is a very long story. Let say it was fate. At the time I was bored being a massage girl. Too much bathing. That's when Malee asked me to come here. "It's pussy-selling all the same," but she's taught me a lot. "O. K., I'll help you with this." Have you ever put what she taught you into practice? "Sis, let's make a deal." Malee said you're gonna be a writer. Make me your heroine and I'll make you my model. I'll prove to you that I too have a mentor. Go! "Oh, does anybody know..." Anything for me tonight? Ask others. I can't go out every night. Are you crazy? "Long time no see, lady boss." I couldn't come. Lots of work. Actually... What is it? "No, nothing, nothing." "I won't do it again, believe me." Don't you dare touch me. "If that bitch ever sleeps on my bed again," I'll shoot the pair of you. "Are you mad, coming in without knocking?" "Sorry, just wanted to surprise you." How many times have I told you to call first! "Darling, I haven't said a word against you." Were you afraid I'd catch you with someone else? "No, no, it wasn't like that." Have you eaten yet? Tell me all about him. He looks like what. He likes what. Am I to be an attacker or a defender? "Slow down, you slut." I didn't teach you to be a street hooker. "Briefly, he's an executive" with taste and education. He hates ones who hurry do it just for money. "Do you want me to fight to my last drop," through extra time till the penalty shoot out? How the hell do you know about football? From the customers you sent. "They're all football mad," phoning bets while screwing me. "If I hadn't been a pro," I'd have kicked them off the bed. You're crazy. Now show him you're a pro. "Right on time, Malee." "Lad, this is Mr. Parinya." Please sit and relax. One gin & tonic and bring my wine. "What would you like, Miss?" "A whisky on the rocks, please." "You have a good memory," just one drink together. But today I must excuse myself. Please cancel the gin & tonic. "Wow, your cars are so beautiful." What would I have to do to get one? Are you trying to get me drunk? "But, sir, we've just met." Could I ask you... are you like this with every girl? I think what you should ask is what's inside this package. How did you know my size? Was I right? "Surely, it must be Malee." What's it between you and a pair of black panties? Why are you always in good mood? Why shouldn't I be? Life's serious enough. What is it about life that bothers you? How do you want me to tell it? A sad version of me being sold to a brothel by my parents? Don't be like others. They just want to be friendly. But don't even dare say hello in public. "Too embarrassing, I guess." I don't know. But I think I like you. "Call me again, if you like me." "But maybe you shouldn't bother," it's expensive. "The black panties thing," you haven't told me yet. I won't tell you. It's a secret. It would be good if they'd make black condoms. Then I'd buy some for you and take it off myself. "If you want to know how I'd take it off," maybe we'd meet a few more times. Wait! I can't go up. There's a birthday party at my house. My youngest and his friends are waiting. That's O. K. See you next time. Will your good byes take long? The hero and heroine should kiss one more time. So a jealous bitch like me can slam the door in their faces. Don't tell me you fell for "that"black-panties"guy." Me? No. Just kind of like him. But you probably would. "Bitch, you always hit back at me." What about you? To me being a writer's first wife is better than a tycoon's second. I still can't decide whether to choose money over love or the other way around. Things are dragging on too long. Maybe I should do something. "Watch out! You might strike lead, not gold." "Aroon, if you're not too sleepy," please come to my room. Be my consultant. Am I disturbing you? Come on in. I can't write now anyway. I'm going to see lad. No idea what she wants. Don't you ever think of going outside once in a while? Haven't you forgotten? I went through this for more than 10 years. "Hey, I didn't mean to hit a soft spot." It doesn't matter. Sit down. "Speaking of prison," "I've always wanted to give you something," for your help in keeping my prison diaries safe. "Here, keep it." "May I ask, how were you able" to survive in that place? I was in prison for a long time. "Life in prison taught me to be stoical," "to endure for something special in life," even though I didn't know what that something was. I wish I could be that stoical. Why don't you try? "Find out first what that something is," then become and remain stoical until that something emerges. You mean? "Yes, that something could be anything." Life can give and take away. "Mine has already lost plenty," before I went and when I was in prison. In there I was slapped hard. But no one saw me spitting out blood and teeth. "I never let them. Especially, my enemies." "Aroon, have you slept yet?" This bitch is really a rare breed. Forgive her. Even I'd love to have a sister like her. A tornado but a charming one. "Without children," who'd look after me when I'm old? Why aren't you looking for a husband? Might have to. But just for the sperm so I can get kids. "Sorry, I have to leave. Otherwise," that bitch will yell again. "What's up, lad?" "Sit down, please." Nothing much. Just heard that you're bored. I've also a plan. "If it materializes," I'll ask Malee to quit this business. Or we'll ruin our private parts before getting old. Do you think I could own a salon like this one? "Lad, you're a wonder." Look who's here. What brought you? "If you want to borrow money, I don't have it" I've got money. Just want something I think you can get for me. A drink first? Whisky on the rocks will do. What do you want me to get for you? "Not a husband, though." You can easily get one yourself. I want a gun. What do you want a gun for? I haven't even seen you slap a face. You're not Pen. "Guns aren't sticks, you know?" "Ma'am, could you please sit? I'm sick." Keep smoking. You'll get cancer before you can get to kill. "Tell me, which dog are you going to kill?" "O.K., you don't have to tell me." When do you want it? Now. I sell alcohol. Guns aren't like those contraband cigarettes in front of my bar. "Come on, I know you can do it." "For you, it's so easy." Wise mouth you got. Take my gun. "You can't shoot, can you?" "Idiot, you failed first test." Don't ever aim a gun at someone's face. Loaded or not. "But once you pull it out, you gotta shoot." "Remember, people aren't like paper targets." Fill in the figures yourself. You should save this for your time in prison. Thanks for the whisky and gun. Life outside prison is difficult enough and you want to get in... You think Pen's too lonely in there? Aren't you going to say something nice? Yeah. Think it over. Give me a bottle of tequila. Don't look stupid. I'll clear it with your boss. "Coffee, sis." That's enough. Thanks. Thank you. "Malee, aren't we taking advantage of Dow?" She told me to think of it as her rent payment. It's okay with me. She still can't sell her manuscript. "Dow, come eat with us." "You're spoiling lazy old bones here," including me. I'm getting more snobbish every day myself. "Cracking jokes this early, lad?" I've something to say. I'm gonna sell this condo and leave Bangkok. I'm too tired of living in this city. I'm thinking of that too. It's about time I choose to be a first or second wife. And for me to be my own boss. Wait until I invite you to chair my salon's opening ceremony. What are you going to do next? You're too rich to have to do anything. Even able to lie idle for the next ten lives. I'm going to work at the Pattaya Orphanage. A foreign friend of mine works there. I can't imagine you raising children. Looking after future toy boys are more likely. "Haven't we taught you enough, lad." "Dow, have you any plans yet?" Yingsak is finding me a job in publishing. "Don't worry, I can live by myself." A young couple was found murdered in an apartment. Police believed adultery was probably the motive. "Hell, news of murders even in the morning." What are people up to? Let me watch this news. The victims were shot dead by an 11 mm. Pistol. Initial investigations found that the murdered man "had relations with a middle-aged woman," and at the same time with a mistress of a mafia boss. Already the police had learned the identity of the suspect "from interviews with eye-witnesses," and would proceed to make the arrest shortly. Why are you laughing? It's a murder. "I didn't laugh at the murder," but at Mr. Cock and Miss Pussy. Those two can really ruin people's lives. "Malee, there're police waiting downstairs." Why are you looking at me like that? I knew they'd be coming. "Come on, let's drink." Who shall we toast to? Who should we congratulate first? How about Auntie Malee? Auntie Malee is going to take care of children. "Don't worry, real kids." How young? Very young. I know what you're thinking. Applause please. Who'd be next? Yingsak has given me the opportunity to be a writer. Why only her? What will you be writing about? Life drama. Eroticism. No one cares about me. I might as well speak up. Quite soon I'll be having my own beauty salon. Good. "How about you, Aroon?" I want to live like an ordinary person. Have a life and a family. Cheers. "O. K., O.K." "Before we get drunk," "we have presents for you, lad." Presents? As one of the members of this Suwanmalee Service? "We're flowers, but not that kind of flowers." We look and smell nice and are ready for every man to pick. "Most important," we're local and not too expensive. "Here, this is from Malee." A check? "No, not a profit share." I'm giving you a big present. Just take this voucher to the store. Thanks. Wow! O.K. I'll be making my first dress for you. "Lad, here's my present." Just don't use it to stab men. Hope you'll be rich from the salon. Thank you. I've got what I want. O. K. But from Yingsak and Dilok I don't want any presents. Just be my customer once. I would remember it until my last day. "Come, let's take a group photo." "I may look bad professionally," "gotta borrow your camera, Aroon." Let it be a gift from a writer who's starving but still able to afford beer. "Come on, Yingsak." Hello. Yes. Okay. Bye-bye. "Lad, you little devil." You sneaked off to call and invite him here. "Now, why don't you go down and greet him?" Didn't you all know who my mentor is? I'm no ordinary whore. "Oh, oh, even in the elevator." "Yingsak, this is Mr. Parinya." Watch what you're saying. He writes. You might end up in one of his books. I don't know how much lad has already told you. But first tell me what's this party for? Why should I tell him your story? I'd rather tell mine. Come to my room. I'll tell you what this party is for. "Sit down, please." What is it? Could you please attend the salon's opening? Of course. But from now on who'd wear those black panties for me? I will. "As a compliment to my favorite customer," I'll give a free show tonight. Where's Malee? I'll take lad out for a little celebration. Hope you don't mind. Not at all. Ladprao 71. Two of my mother's friends didn't come. Their names weren't in the letter either. Where are they? "One was Aroon's husband," "The other's lad," Was it like in the novel? Do you think what she wrote was fact or fiction? My mother didn't tell me much. "Not only about her friends," I don't even know who my father is. You must love your daughter a lot. It'd be a long time before I get out. Prison will teach you not to hope for anything. Hope can torment you. But it will also teach you when to hit or duck. I know real well what I must do and for what. "Hey, so your boss must now" rely on a cucumber. Cut it out. It's none of your business. "Bitch, whose turf are you on?" Get your stuff and get out! Or do you also want a pestle? I've several. "Know what, sweetheart? This will be the day." Go catch her! Help me! Let me go! Let me go! I always wanted you as my Number One. "But since you're such a snob," this thing suits you more. You and I are convicts just the same. Strip her! This month is no good. Let's me see. Stuff her mouth and drag her in. I've never boasted "You know who I am?" But everybody knows who I am. Except you. You'll get to know now. But not by me. Dow. Do what you want to. Grab her hand! You're right. I'm a convict. "But prison can only change my look," not my soul. "You want a convict, I'd be one." "If you won't stop messing with me," I'll cut off your hand! Alright? Yes. I hear that bitch Theweerat is moving to her hometown prison. How is your daughter? She'd be as tall as your mango tree now. Pain in the chest? And numbness on the upper left arm? Maybe you should ask to go to the hospital. I'm sorry. Your father has passed away. "Sis, here is another diary." What about the ones I gave you earlier? I hope when I get out they'll be O. K. I'm so busy I don't have time to visit you. The things you had asked me to buy I gave to Aroon to take care of. "Don't worry, when you're released" they'll remain in good order. I heard you schemed against me to get me kicked out of my shop position. Why would I do it? I'll be leaving here soon anyway. Bitch! Think you can fool me? Why can't we live apart? The last punishment I gave you. Wasn't it enough? "If I ever get kicked out," be careful wherever and whenever you go. Don't ever close your eyes when you sleep. What can a brothel slut like you do? Go tell the doctor! Thanks for saving my life. "Dow, go stand in the rain." Two men called me a slut. I killed them with my own hands. Nobody's allowed to call me that again. How was Pen's wake? Went alright. She asked to keep her body until both of us died. But I wonder who'll be first. "Speak of dying," It's been three days now since I last went to the toilet and I couldn't eat much. Tomorrow I've got to go for a check-up. "It's colon cancer, last stage." Doctor. Yes. May I see the wardress? Okay. Please let me die in area 8. "Darling, I'm the one to go first." What did the doctor say? Why couldn't he do anything? And why didn't he keep you at the hospital? Don't worry about it. I asked to come back here myself. Do you forget what I did before becoming a convict? "Funny, isn't it?" "I've helped a lot of people," but for myself I never suspected anything. "Darling, we came here at the same time." But I'm going out before you. Can I ask you for something? I've always wanted to have another daughter. I haven't had a mother for most of my life. "Hey, I already did what you had told me." You aren't the same one I imagined from the diaries. Come take a photo to keep as a keepsake. Are you embarrassed? Why should I be! Can I help you take the photo? Joy! How did you know I'd be released today? Have you forgotten who was my boss? Here is the hope I told you about. Do you think she's worth it? Say hello to your aunt. "One, two, three."
