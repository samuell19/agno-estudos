- I'm not sure why you looked me up. It was so long ago. Lifetimes ago. I don't think I remember much about my childhood. It was such a unpleasant blur. It's so nice. It's so nice to see a friend. I don't have many friends anymore. I love it after a storm. They say it's. - Very very nice. Wonderful. I like everything. Do your favorite dinosaur. If you have a favorite dinosaur, do your favorite dinosaur. Jack. Trouble? - Mom always said you had the brains in the family. Now I cleared it with your boss, you got the rest of the afternoon off. - I don't think so Jack. - You're coming with me. Either standing up or lying down, it's your choice. - There's no smoking allowed Jack. - So call a cop. You may have gotten the smarts little brother, but I got the sense of humor. You remember my younger brother don't you Lou? - Yeah, sure, hiya Mike, how ya doing? Sorry to bring you in on this. - Bring me in? - I took the liberty of sending a black and white over to your apartment. Make sure your cappuccino maker's turned off. - Hey, where are we going Jack? - Inner city. Fill him in Lou. - Three weeks, three homicides, all of them women Mike. One a week like a clock. Clean work, brutal. This one was a real looker. So all of them were stabbed. Mutilated really. Each one had a right tit cut off. But this one had a note written in her own blood, pinned to her body. Said, "Can Mikey Reid come out to play?" So we backtracked. Each one was between 5'5 ", 5'8". Blonde or pension for wearing blonde wigs. A call girl and or a serious drug user. They were all 29 to 34. - I don't understand, how do you know the note is for me? I mean, there must be more than one Michael Reid. - Hey Mike, you remember Cyndi Thornburg? You know, when you were about five? She showed you hers, you showed her yours? Don't be looking for hers anymore. - We just found her body a couple of hours ago Mike. - You know, I'm hurt. I'm hurt three years, three years and not a peep out of you. What do you think about that Lou? My own brother, my own flesh and blood, he doesn't give a damn about me. Doesn't acknowledge my phone calls, my yearly birthday card. - Hey, I don't blame ya Mike, I can't stand him myself. He's gonna chain smoke himself to death and take me with him. - Our cousin Steve moved back to our beloved city. You know that don't you? That's exactly what I thought you'd say. You still having those nightmares Mike? - No Jack, they stopped three years ago. The timing makes you wonder, doesn't it Lou? - You guys. - You wait here. Barrett, what the hell are you doing here? You don't have jurisdiction in a case like this. - Your killer may have crossed state lines Jack. - Don't give me that look. Don't give me that god damn look you sanctimonious... - Hey! It's a crime scene! Come on. Just take a breath Barrett! - I'm not one of your federal floozies! - Careful. Hey, you guys just talk to each other will ya? - Careful Jack. Watch him, okay? Take care of him. - Hey, hey, hey, hey! Hey, I told ya, stay outside! - Come here. - All right, so, what do you think? - Mike is one of the great liars of his generation or he didn't do it. You choose. - Well, thanks Lou. That's a lot of help. All right, send him home, have him come down to the station tomorrow morning for some Q&A. - All right, all right. You okay Mike? - Who's the guy he attacked? - Just some feebie who likes to take credit when credit isn't due. - Feebie? - FBI. Agent Barrett. Jack hates the FBI, especially that one. I like that about Jack. - Yeah, you like a lot about Jack. - I owe him my life. When Jack and I were in junior high, I wasn't the Adonis you see before you now. I was what you would call a nerd. Or a wimp. And you know Mike, we went to a pretty tough school. So anyway, I was taking it on the chin pretty good there from a lot of people, and not just physically but mentally too. And I was having some serious trouble then one day, Jack says to me, "Can I walk with you to school?" And from that day on, Jack walked with me both to and from school. And from that very first day Mike, my whole life changed. My whole life changed. - A serial killer. That's what we have and that's what we don't want. Good or bad, the feebies are in on this. And I want complete cooperation, you understand Jack? - Whatever you say, I'm easy to live with. - What about your brother? - We've been questioning him all afternoon. He says he was home asleep. He's got alibis for both the other killings and we can't find any reason to believe different, but we're checking him out. - Just the same, I want a 24-hour surveillance on Michael Reid starting now. Lab? - Nothing, not even fibers. - Did Mike know the first two victims? Or did they know him? - No and no. - Lou, give us a minute will you? - Sure. - This must be tough on you. I miss you. - I've been busy. I got a killer to catch. Wait, wait. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I'm not good at this relationship stuff. - By all rights, you shouldn't even be in on this case. Now that your brother's implicated. The only reason you're still involved is because I have a thing for you. But it's quickly fading. You know that don't you? - Please. - Say it again. Louder. - Please. - You know you want me Jack. I'm gonna make you pay. - I know, and I'm gonna enjoy every minute of it. How about Saturday night? - Will you bring that wine? - The 82 O'Brien. - You know what I like. Jack. What if your brother is involved? What then? - Okay Mike, your brother had some unfinished business with the Captain. We're gonna meet him downstairs, come on. - I've been answering questions all day Lou. I just wanna go home. - Just get rid of that loan furniture he's got on the front row. - Classic bachelor pad, huh? - Jack. - Hey Mike. I'd like you to meet a friend of mine. - Jessica Turner. - Michael Reid. - I see the resemblance. - See Mike, you can't separate blood or facts. - We gotta go Jack. - Stay where I can find you now. - Don't worry, I won't bite. - I... - So Jack says I need to look at your apartment. I'm an interior decorator. Surely Jack mentioned me. Jack didn't mention me? Come on, I'll take you to an early dinner. - I'm sorry, I didn't know. - So, wanna come back to my place for a night cap? - Yes, but not tonight. Is that all right? - Yeah, that's all right. Goodnight. - Oh my God, this is the worst. It's not my fault the bus got a flat tire and I was only 15 minutes late. He's such a jerk. You know what, I quit. I'm so sick of them. Jesus this place is creepy. My God. How did I get up in this place? Okay. Just keep walking. Okay, just keep going. You're fine, you're fine. God, you're letting your imagination go. You're fine. Okay. You're alone. Jesus. Okay. - Hello. Steve? Yeah, long time. Uh-uh, not tonight. I'm not up for it. All right. All right. Friday. Okay. Yeah, I know where it is. I'll be there! Now what is it? No, I thought you were someone else. Now? Yeah. Yeah it is. Where is it? 20 minutes. - What we have here is a failure to adjust. Jack Stillman is a loose cannon and I'm trying. - That was in the past. You know it and I know it. - And I'm trying to be as diplomatic as possible. - I will not remove Jack from this case, just because the two of you have an old score to settle. - I'm not asking for his removal. I'm requesting he be reassigned to a lesser role. - What? Spear carrier? - Not a bad suggestion. - You're jealous Barrett. You may have gotten credit for closing the Armstrong kidnapping, but we both know who did the work. Don't we? - Reassign him. - No. - Hi Mike, have a seat. Augusta, bring us some more coffee will you? - We've had another killing. Another note. Getting kinda cute ain't it? "When the horses are set free they run wild." That phrase have any significance for you? Ring any bells? - Should it? - You've heard it before. - Haven't you? - It was pinned to the last victim Mike. - All right, let's stop dancing so far apart on this. You know as well as I do cousin Stevie used to say that all the time. - Your memory's failing Jack. The three of us called ourselves free wild horses when we were younger. Are we all suspects? - You are becoming one giant pain in the ass younger brother. - Four weeks, four murders, no leads, no motives, equals the pressure to put the squeeze on somebody. Anybody. But you are not helping us much Mike. - And Little Red Riding Hood turns right around and she looked down and she says, "But grandma, grandma, "what big eyes you have." And the big bad wolf, so so fast on it, he looked back at the Little Red Riding Hood and he says, "The better to see you with my dear." And then Little Red Riding Hood, one more time, notices the teeth on that big old bad wolf. And that doesn't look like her grandma's teeth. She looks down and she says, "But grandma, what big teeth you have!" And the big bad wolf looks back at her and says, "The better to eat..." One second. Will you stay here, one second. - It's been over a week. I thought I was more desirable than that? - Well I'm... - Jack told me where to find you. - Oh, good old Jack. - Well if you don't wanna see me, I'll leave. - No, no, no please. Please, come on in. I'm telling a story. "Little Red Riding Hood." - And you must be the big bad wolf. Do you believe in love at first sight? Well I do. And I knew that there was something special between us the very first time I ever saw you. Why won't you let me in? I'm knocking. I'm knocking. - Woo hoo! Shit now! Bartender, I wanna buy that yuppie over there a drink. And give me a double Jack Daniels on the rocks. - Hi Steve. - "Hi Steve." Hey cousin, what kind of a greeting is that? Get up here, I wanna give you a hug. Hey, what's it been, three or four years? - Yeah. - You look good. I know, I know, I look like shit. But I look like this country feels. What, with the Germans and the Japanese kicking our ass. And what now, the Chinese? But you look good man. You really do. I'll bet it's because you're one of the only ones left still employed in this wonderful country. You still teaching? - Yes. - The gifted little ones? - Yes. - Man, you ought to teach 12th graders Mikey. I want you to enjoy your work more you know. Especially around the females. Have you seen a 12th grader recently? Oh shit now. They look like 25-year-old goddesses. It's that damn MTV that does it. Yo! Are you gonna tell me? - Tell you what? - Tell me what a shit you think I am for not paying you back. Mikey, I refuse to drink with somebody that's colder than ice in my glass. - $7,000 Steve. What'd you do, buy drugs? - I thought I was buying drugs, but I ended up with enough flour to put White Bread out of business. You know, it's a damn shame that nobody eats White Bread anymore. But don't worry, look, I will pay you back it's just that times have been kind of tough. - It's been four years Steve. It's okay, it's good to see ya. But it's still been four years! - Hey, come on man. Don't pressure me. I don't respond well to pressure! - Uh huh, okay, bye bye. - Hello. I don't know about blondes having more fun, but I have more fun with blondes. - So you like blondes Steve? - Always have Mikey. Kinda feel weird isn't it? - Yeah. Kinda weird. - You didn't do it did you Mike? - Did you? - Me? I can't even hit my ex-wife, and I hate her awful. You still didn't answer my question. - I hardly remember her. Cyndi Thornburg. Why in the hell would someone kill someone from my past Steve? A past I barely remember, wanna forget. - To get your attention. Whew! Jack hates me you know. - Yep. - Is it my fucking fault? - You've been arrested Steve. Jack sees in black and white. When you have a record you are no longer a good guy, you are a bad guy and you will never ever be a good guy again. - When the horses are set free, they shall run wild. Can you believe it? Jack used that line to bring me in today. No offense Mike, but your fucking brother is a liar. - What are you talking about? - Jack. He brought me in for questioning. Six fucking hours worth because he said that was the note that the killer left behind. But my lawyer, he found out about the real note. - What real note? - "Come out and play Mikey Reid." - Stef? Stef. Stef, is that you? Stefanie? Oh Smokey! You scared me to death. How'd you get in? Man, somebody's gonna pay tonight, 'cause girl, you are gonna dress to kill. Mm-hm. - Police search warrant! Don't do it Stevie. - I don't need this you know. I don't even know why I agreed to it. So now what? - Oh I don't know. Now what? - This is great. Look, I'll make it very quick for both of us. You give me a clean bill of health for the police and I'm out of your hair. Sound good? - You know, your brother may have influenced you to see me, but it was your decision. You and Jack have different fathers, is that correct? Tell me about yours. - He died was very young. I didn't know him, he didn't know me. - Okay, tell me about your dreams. - Nightmares. - All right, tell me about your nightmares. - Do you have a file on me? - Yes. - Please, just look it up. I'm sure it's all in there. - You mean about your mother and her death? Michael, I'd like to hear your side of the story. You were found right next to her body. And you were playing with a handgun that your mother kept in the house for protection and it went off. Is that correct? Michael, it went off three times. The file report says that at the tender age of five, you killed your mother by shooting her three times. At point blank range. - I'm waiting and ready - Give me. - Got a penthouse on Lakeshore. A call girl, brutal. Left a new note. "Mikey Reid loves little white trash." Crazy huh? - Yeah. Crazy. What about the stakeout at Mike's apartment? - No, Mike just left for school. No one saw him leave his apartment last night. But there is something else with this one. The killer took all five fingers of her right hand. And it wasn't her jewelry 'cause we found the rings, we just couldn't find the fingers. I think maybe she touched him with that hand. With those fingers. - Maybe Lou. Maybe. - One black wallet, one black comb. One black lighter. - Oh shit! - Cigarettes. Keys. $10 bill, pair of sunglasses. - Hey Jack! Look, no cuffs! You don't look too happy cous. Maybe I better go out and drown a puppy just to cheer yourself up. You know, rumor has it there's been another killing since I've been in here. I guess that blows your theory about me being a bad guy. - You'll be back asshole. Losers like you always are. - Hey, what happened to your face Jack? Did you cut yourself shaving? Next time you ought to let me do it. - Do you come here often? - Not anymore. I need to tell you about my past. What I remember. - I'd love to hear about it. - It's not very pleasant. - That's all right Michael. I won't run away. - And now I'm a suspect. I don't know how or why, but I am a major suspect for murder. I hope I haven't scared you away. - Not at all. - I think the time has come for you to tell me. Don't you? How does it start? From the beginning. - I'm not five years old. I'm my age now, I'm in this house, a regular house on a regular street. It's dark. I'm walking in the hallway. I'm naked. I see a door cracked open, I stop, I hear sounds. I slowly push the door open. The room is a wash in yellow, sun yellow. A woman is on the bed, her back is to me, she's nude. I enter the room. She's moving, writhing, grunting. She's masturbating. Even from the back she's gorgeous. Blonde hair flowing. She turns around to look at me and it's my mother. She looks at me and winks and looks down at my hands. I look down at my hands. I now have a gun, but it's hot. It burns my hands. Her eyes go wide with fear. She slides off the bed. She's pleading with me but I can't hear her. She crosses toward me, she's pleading and crying. She screams, a gun goes off. I scream. Blood flows. I look down at my hands, the gun is too hot to hold. I drop it to the floor. I wake up covered with sweat. It's always the same. - Fuck! - Steve Reid? - It was closed for renovation years ago. Now it's actually tied up in a legal dispute. I was hoping to be involved in the restoration. Come on. Come on! - Mikey Reid, Mikey Reid! Can Mikey Reid come out to play? - So you finally found me. - What did you yell to me? - I didn't yell anything. What's wrong Michael? - I don't know. I thought I heard voices in the hallways. - The hotel ghosts probably. All the people who never paid their bills forced to spend eternity wandering the empty corridors. Hello! Hello! It's magnificent isn't it? - Yes, magnificent. - I always wanted to be on the stage. I think it'd be very exciting, don't you? Is this how she looked? Come to mama. - You okay? - Great. Yeah. I couldn't be better. Look what they've done to me Mikey. Look what they've done to me. Why? I don't look to good do I? - You've looked worse. - I'm scared Mikey. Don't let them come in here and get me, okay. Please promise me that you won't let them come in here and get me. - I promise you Steve, I won't. - They wouldn't let up. They just kept pounding on me, you know. I probably deserved some of it, but they just kept pounding on me. - You get some rest, okay. - Don't let 'em get to me okay. Don't let 'em get me bro. - I promise Steve. You get some rest, and I'll see ya soon. - Barrett had him picked up and brought in for questioning. He was trying to get at me through Steve. He didn't know that Stevie and I aren't exactly bosom buddies. And anyway, some of the guys in the holding tank decided they wanted to get to know him better. Hey, the little bastard fought them off for a while there. - Losing your touch Jack? Letting the FBI push you around now? Don't you get sick of the filth around you Jack? Doesn't it even bother you? - Look you little dilettante, you lead your clean white lie of a life. You don't hear me preaching to you! Yeah, my hands are dirty, 'cause I work beneath the surface where real life is. Lies and filth! You show me an honest man, I'll show you someone with a skeleton in his closet, maybe more than one. - Well you should know Jack, you should know. - I must be in heaven. Hello. Tina. I guess you're wondering what a nice guy like me is doing here looking like this, right? - All right Romeo, let's go. - Fire guys anywhere in sight. I'm just gonna stand there, right? So I head back up the escape and the mom and the two kids are screaming at me to stay with them! Saying that I had done enough. But I must go where I am needed so I find myself on the sixth floor window again, and then all of a sudden, the next thing I realize, I'm in the back of an ambulance. The paramedics said that I have saved nine more people before a retaining wall gave way and buried me. You know, the firefighters, they got me out just in time. I guess that only proves that every good deed always comes back around. Sometimes sooner than you think. You know, you have the most beautiful blonde hair Tina. - Straight! Ooh, fire. - Pay me. - I don't understand. - Pay me. That's what you want isn't it? Your own whore tonight. Pay me. And every fantasy is yours. - Fractured skull, broken nose, shattered cheekbone, possibly blindness in one eye, three broken ribs. Bottom line, he's in a coma, and the feebies want blood. Your blood Jack. They'll spare no expense on this one. And I will not allow you to drag this department down with you. I need the truth. Did you do it? I need the truth. - No, I didn't do it. - Then catch me a killer. - Jack. - Some things are best left unsaid partner. - Here ya go. - Oh Christ! They think I'm a junkie? Lou, there's enough sugar in this thing to keep me strung out for a week! - It's the same as it ever was Jack. And we've been coming here for years. Nothing's changed buddy. - Do you ever wish you were somewhere else Lou? Or somebody else even. - No. - I've been on the force 23 years, but this case, this case has got me stumped. And for the first time since I was a kid I'm scared. - You mean about Mike? - I mean, how would I know the truth even though I saw it? We were never really that close. You know, the way brothers are supposed to be. I mean hell Lou, you're more like a brother to me. But we're family. You can't separate that. Even if you wanted to sometimes. - Mike is no killer Jack. - If he has to get arrested, I want to be the one to bring him in. Let the other guys know that will you? - Sure Jack, I'll let 'em know. - I'm coming. Coming. Relax will ya, I'm coming! - Hey, you look a little rough around the edges this morning Mike. You have a bad night? Where were you last night? We got another dead body who wants to know. Take a look around Lou. - Sure Jack. - Procedure. - Procedure? Like when you put Barrett into a coma? - Family's gotta stick together Mike. - Jack, we may be brothers, but I don't like you. I don't like your job, your style, your habits. And Jack, you never liked me either. If you had a single shred of evidence you would've arrested me by now. - Where were you last night? - He was with me. - This is cute. This is very cute. Willing to testify in court? - Yes. - Come on Jack, let's go. - Thanks for coming on such short notice. I wanna make up. I wanna apologize about this morning. We made an arrest today. A drifter. Can you believe it? His name is Michael Reid. Charlotte, two more! - Sit down. - We'll celebrate. It's gonna be a great night tonight. Come on Charlotte! - Mike. You know I love you don't you? Don't you? I never believed for one minute you killed those women. You gotta believe me. Come on, don't ya? - You don't even know me Jack. - Well that's not my fault, is it? You've changed Mike! - Thank God! - What the hell was that, a laugh? Humor? This is a great day! Charlotte! Charlotte! My baby brother just laughed! Call the newspaper! And bring us two more! ♪ There was a wild ♪ ♪ Colonial boy ♪ ♪ Jack Duggan was his name ♪ - Thank ya darlin'! ♪ He was born and reared ♪ ♪ In Ireland ♪ ♪ In a place called Castlemaine ♪ ♪ He was his father's only son ♪ ♪ His mother's pride and joy ♪ ♪ And dearly did his parents love ♪ ♪ This wild colonial boy ♪ - What are you doing? - Hey, I like this stuff. This brother stuff. We're brothers Mikey. It's not my fault. - She's really something isn't she? At least she was for me. - Who? - Don't play dumb, Jessica. She's a great lay right? - You and her? - Hey, I did it for you. She's one of the best I ever had. Geez Mike, I meant for you to fuck her not fall in love with her. Hey, hey! Don't do something stupid! - You passed her onto me! Why? - She saw your picture, she thought you were cute. Besides, you needed someone to loosen you up! Hey Mike, Mike, wait! I'm the designated driver! - Where are you now? - I'm watching her. She's on the bed moving up and down. - Now don't look down. Do you hear me? Don't look at your hands, only look at your mother. - She turns and winks at me. She slides off the bed moving toward me, smiling. I'm scared. I'm scared of her, I... I put my hand up to keep her away. She grabs it and pulls me to her. A gun goes off! But I don't have the gun! I don't have the gun! - Look around you, is anybody else there? - Mikey Reid. Mikey Reid. - Are you all right? Michael! - Mike, are you okay Mike? I got some bad news. That drifter isn't our killer Mike. His name isn't even Mike Reid. And second, Mike we gotta talk about Jack. Mike! Mike! Mike! - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Coming! Yeah, come right in Mike! - Why Jack? I don't understand why. - To get to the other side! - This isn't a joke! Did they hurt ya? Did they remind you of mom? Did they want money from ya? - Hey, hey! - Most of the victims were prostitutes weren't they? - I'll call you later sweetheart, all right. - Mom used to do it for money sometimes, that's what you told me. - Yeah that's what I told you 'cause it's true. - What do you know about truth? You killed 'em, you killed her! And you wanted to make me believe that I did it. I saw the smoking gun Jack! - The smoking gun. - They remind you of mom? All of them? You killed them all. And you tried to frame Steve for it didn't ya? But it didn't work. - Listen asshole, I didn't kill mom, you did. If I wanted to frame a loser like Steve, I'd just do it. - And that drifter you picked up? He's not your man, you coming after me now? What was it like killing your own mother? - I've been waiting on this one Mikey. - You have reached the voicemail for Detective Lou Cone. Please leave your message. - Lou. This is Michael Reid. - Jessica. - Let me have this Michael. - Guess what? Guess what? - I give up. - I'm getting married again. - Congratulations. Who's the unlucky gal? - My nurse. - I'm getting married also. - Come on, who would marry you? - My interior decorator. - Woo, shit now! You know, it's kinda weird how things turned out isn't it? - Yeah, kinda weird. - I lost enough sleep over this Pat. It's deeper than you know. - Lou, come on, it makes no sense. - None of it makes sense! - The killer used plastic gloves on every kill. Jack had none. Not even in his apartment. - Jack was coming apart at the seams. - The killer used a butchers knife, not a kitchen knife. - The killer used a knife. - So Jack goes to Jessica's apartment to kill her but doesn't use the butcher's knife or plastic gloves? - Yeah. - I mean, Jack had her - kitchen knife in his hand for Christ sake. - Yeah, he sure did. - Well aren't you forgetting about the two alibi witnesses. Two witnesses say that Jack was nowhere near the scene of the crime. - The two witnesses were a couple of Jack's low-life snitches. Look, Jack is dead. It's been six months. There haven't been any other killings. - You buy off on that? - The case is closed Pat. That's the way they want it upstairs. - Yeah right. - Copycat? Pat, I want you to go downtown and look through every file on those Jack Stillman murders. Maybe I missed something. - You got it Lou. Jack. - Sorry Lou. Dug it up personal. The department misplaced it. You're not gonna believe what you read. - Lou! - Hello Mike. - Trouble? - Mike, this is my partner, Pat Lasen. Jack always said you had the brains in the family Mike. Is Jessica home? - No, she's away this morning on a seminar, why? - Mike, can we sit down a minute? We wanna ask you some questions. Mike, did you know that Jessica changed her name? - What? Her real name is Lisa Anne Miller. She used to live directly behind you when you were a kid. You used to play with her. - Mikey Reid, Mikey Reid! - Michael Reid, you stay away from that window. - Mikey Reid, Mikey Reid! I love you Mikey Reid, do you love me? - I warned you about coming around here you little dirty white trash! - Can Mikey Reid come out to play? - Go home Lisa Anne! - Come Mikey Reid come out to play? - You little loud mouth! Go home and leave us alone! - Can Mikey Reid come out to play? Can Mikey Reid come out to play? - Lisa Anne is a dirty little white trash picker! ♪ Lisa Anne is a dirty little white trash picker ♪ ♪ Lisa Anne is a dirty little white trash picker ♪ - Can Mikey Reid come out to play? Can Mikey Reid come out to play? - Lisa Anne is a dirty little white trash picker! - Mikey Reid, Mikey Reid! I love you Mikey Reid, do you love me? - Jessica Anne, Lisa Anne are one in the same. Jack ran a file on her. I don't know why he didn't tell me, but he didn't go there that night to kill her. He went there to get a confession. He went there to confront her. Maybe that's why he picked up the knife. We may be able to tie her to your first wife's death. - The hit and run driver, the one nobody could locate? She was a woman matching Jessica's description. - Now I know this sounds crazy Mike, but she may have been stalking you all these years. She went to the same university you did. Did you know that? No. And her private practice was a block away from where you taught school, but she never identified herself. - I love you Michael Reid and I won't ever let anyone take you away. You love me too? - Whoa Mike! Hold it back! - Michael, what's going on? - Are you Lisa Anne Miller? - Michael, I don't understand. - Are you Lisa Anne Miller! - Michael, you're not making sense. - Are you Lisa Anne Miller! - I'll be whoever you want me to be. - Jack was right about you wasn't he? Why would you hurt me? - Michael, please, you don't understand. - I killed my brother for you. Did you kill my wife? - Don't destroy us Michael. - Did you kill my mother? Did you kill my mother! - I won't let anyone take you away from me Mikey Reid! - Well, that's my story and it's the truth. The whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help me God! - Uh-uh, don't want no more dreams. Uh-uh, no more dreams about no city lights. Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy. Did I ever tell you I was in the circus. Yes in the circus. Uh-huh, just gonna mop this floor clean as a whistle. Clean as a whistle. - Now, this next patient is of particular interest. He's a paranoid schizophrenic. At the tender of age of five, he killed his mother. Shot her three times point blank range. As to why, well we're still a long way from finding that out. And instead of dealing with his healthy feelings of guilt and shame over the murder, he continues to mask his feelings in complex misogynistic stories. Stories that try to explain how his mothers murder may have happened. But let's give him credit. Anyone who would make me the detective in a story certainly has a nimble imagination. - I believe the villain in his last story was you Jessica. - After he concocts these stories he retreats briefly into a sort of semi-catatonic state.
