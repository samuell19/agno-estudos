That's what you think. Last time the critics slated you Gilbert the critic... You're only here as publicity for my film, nothing else The lndians around Bombay claim... l'm not sure it's true, but they claim... ...that if you look a tiger straight in the eye, it will not attack you ls that possible? - What? - ls it that easy? Just the opposite. Maybe it's the most difficult thing Especially when the tiger is looking at you... ...straight in the eye, too! Where are these wonderful people going to? Why do we see them aboard this marvellous... Excuse me, Mr Orlando, you're in the waiters' way Would you mind moving to that corner? Thank you, l am so grateful. Forgive me Now then, where are all these people going? ls it true that they represent the highest values... ...of show business and the art world? l will tell you who they are The superintendent of La Scala Theatre in Milan His illustrious colleague from the Rome Opera House The one involved in the rat scandal The woman with her back to us... ...is his second wife, a former Romanian singer... ...and with the daughter of his first wife. That rather eccentric man is his secretary They say he is an amazing medium Next to the window is the legendary conductor, Von Rupert The child prodigy... ...who is always hanging on to Mummy's petticoats There is a seagull outside flapping its wings like a conductor As a reporter, it's my job to relate everything down to the finest detail So then, the famous tenor, Aureliano Fuciletto He's that gentleman down there with the beard - Don't you want it? - Very funny! The two superintendents from the Viennese Opera. They're greeting us The feared columnist, Brenda Hilton Hello, Ziloev! The deepest bass in the world The mezzo-soprano, Valegnani, and the delightful lnes Ruffo Saltini The singing masters, the Rubetti brothers And finally, the undisputed queen vocalist of our times - lldebranda Cuffari. - What's your name? - David Fitzmayer - What do you do? - l'm a conductor - Of an orchestra? - That's right Thank you. And this lady here? - She's a famous dancer. - l see. What's her name? - Svetlana! Everyone knows her! - Thank you He's flown in! He must be a seagull home-bird! - Get a ladder brought here. - Get the net from my cabin! lt's never happened before. lt's just a stupid accident l'm terribly sorry l'm not afraid They will catch it Put it over there and be careful - Who' s going up? - Tonino! - Hurry up! - We will give it a try You will scare it even more like that Here's the net Tonino, watch the lampshade And the bird flew free... ...in search of its cage Do l know you? My name is Orlando. l would like to interview you - Talk to my secretary. - Very well. Until later then Come here, little one Have they caught it? Come out, fly away! - Goodbye! Bon voyage. - l'm changing tables tomorrow Captain, the seagull has left the ship He should be the one to change tables Mama, you've got a feather in your neck - Take it off. - Calm down, my dear lldebranda, it's good luck. lt wanted to give you a present - Here it is! - l don't want to see it Maestro! One, two... His dream was to have an equestrian statue 5 metres high And now that he has it, he can't see it. Poor Father l'm a journalist, l have to interview the Grand Duke The VlP we were expecting is Grand Duke Herzog - How old is he? - ln political competence, aged 8 Followed by his sister, Lerinia. She lost her sight when she was a child... ...yet she walks with such confidence at the Prime Minister's side She doesn't want people's compassion She doesn't want to be helped ''Consomm'e vichyssois, potage de tortue... '' l would like that delicious cream l had yesterday - Maitre, remember what it was? - Potage printemps This! Cailles truff'ees... yes! Do you want to know the reason for this voyage? lt's a funeral. ''A funeral?'', you will ask That's right These famous people are here to attend a funeral lt was written in her last will and testament ''Cremation and ashes scattered to the wind... ''...just off the island where l was born'' And this, Erimo lsland, is where Edmea Tetua was born... ...and where her soul wishes to return Edmea Tetua, the greatest singer of all time A vocal miracle Blue Blue and white Ultramarine blue Light blue... Dark blue... Emerald green. Green Light blue Music allows her to see a rainbow of colours White, white... My sister claims that every note corresponds to a colour A scientist has proved that some people... ...have a chromatic vision of sounds Please allow me to interrupt you l don't believe you can experience such a thing Anyone can claim to see colours Mr Kuntz, it's obvious that not everyone... ...has such a sensitive soul l don't doubt it But scientific testimony of the case is almost impossible l used to see everyone's faces as green once Everyone can pick up the colours of music Voices are colours, too You always say that my voice is grey lt's not always grey. When you are worried... ...your voice turns rusty-brown Whereas the voice of the Chief of Police... ...is always the same colour - yellow, opaque yellow And our General's voice? l would have to listen to it first. General? This is my voice l will never be a singer lt's strange l can't see a colour. lt's a voice without a colour lt seems empty, there's an absence... An absence in the Head of the Armed Forces is worrying! Here they are. Her ashes are all in here For this casket, so tiny... ...and yet so big... ...friends from all over the world... ...have hired one of the most luxurious transatlantic liners... ...commanded by the heroic captain from Genoa, the indomitable... La Spezia. La Spezia! Born in the indomitable La Spezia... Captain Leonardo De Robertis... - What's is it? - Roberto De Leonardis! - What did l say? - Roberto De Leonardis! He's the man who will take us to Erimo lsland... ...so that we will all be able to solemnly celebrate... ...the funeral rite of the scattering... Sir Reginald! Excuse me Sir Reginald! Sir Reginald! Excuse me Just a couple of questions Were you the person who booked our divine singer... ...for her debut in London? - Of course. Now excuse me - Thank you Look, he's searching for her This is the second helm, in case the one in the command deck breaks down There's a device you insert to cut the other one off - When do you use it? - ln case of emergency - What's under here? - Come up He's Egyptian. lt appears he was our artist's lover The owner of his country's railways lt appears he has a huge, purple penis Of course, l've only heard about it There he is! He hasn't found her There are strange rumours going around about the baron and his wife You saw him. He was distraught Distraught and yearning The F note is wrong. Can't you hear it? lt's out of tune What? lt's perfect That's not falling Remove the water and it's too much That's not falling! You have the hearing of an ass! You're going up instead of coming down! How wonderful! lt looks fake No! Look, you can see both the sun and the moon The overture to the Barber of Seville gives me goose bumps That's Andromeda And that small star on the right was only discovered 50 years ago You're giving us astronomy lessons! That star is called Cauda Pavonis lt's silver-blue, but it changes from emerald to orange lt was discovered by a famous surgeon, an amateur astronomer Guess what his name was. Reginald! Beyond the legend of the great singer... ...there was a child who was very sensitive and lonely Maybe you want to know a bit more about Edmea's life... That lady is her cousin, you can ask her Captain... How are you, Father? What a sight! On one side, the coldness of the moon... - Good evening. - Divine! ...on the other, the flames of the sun, how wonderful And between the light and the darkness, is you, lldebranda Thank you. How poetic! - Can l keep you company? - lt's very damp here l hadn't seen her for 30 years Forgive me, but l have no memories Thank you. You've said something all the same They say that when the moon is up they cannot work the night shift... Hello! And who are you, my friend? And yet l will have to write about you and that man down there That fat man who's waving to me. Never seen him before Mine is a strange profession She never wanted to read, or even sign her contracts lt was as though the practical side to her profession... ...deeply offended her We're talking the usual sentimental mush She could quote the tiniest detail of every clause of her contract Once she said to me, ''Can't we take my name off the bill?'' l think she was greatly aware of her personal charm She would win everyone over lt appeared that way, but she was very insecure She was terrified of strangers Let's forget this business about her being a child! She was no child, she was terrifying! - So you think she was aggressive? - She'd throw things at you - Aureliano! - l've never had any problems - Can l have some red wine? - Of course Lambrusco She was the perfect partner. She respected me a great deal That made our collaboration ideal She told me l was the greatest ltalian tenor lt's true. She would always say... ''lt is always a joy to sing with Sabatino Lepori'' Once, in my home, she was enchanted by a painting... ...and her eyes filled with tears Have you nothing to tell us about her? The most extraordinary thing was that... ...at the end of La Traviata, she really would have a fever She really identified with the part of Violetta Mama, were you fond of Edmea Tetua? lt's not one of your more fortunate evenings l saw him coming out of the cabin looking very pleased with himself Tell me, was it worth it? Violet, answer me! l shall fall asleep straight away tonight. l'm really tired l want to know all about it, all the details You'd seen him to the dock, hadn't you? Be good, l'm sleepy - You went too far - He came to mend the light He's not worthy of you You know l'm afraid of the dark What a whore! l admire you Tell me in your own little voice ''Yes, Reginald, l am a great whore!'' But l won't tolerate you disregarding our pact! Yes! - That's enough with this bear. - Not him! Why do you treat me this way? Yes, l deserve it, you must. Do what you have to do You need to You're a queen My child-mistress needs it Please, do it Violet, do it! That's right, again! Again! Vocal phenomenon Divine voice One hundred singers rolled into one All those definitions, all those words All those stories written about you But no one ever said who you really were You will never be without your favourite flower No one knows your secret. Only l know who you are, my love ''You are a child who came from the sea'' Remember the poem l wrote you? ''Born from the sea like a goddess...'' Who is it? Who's there? Your Highness, l am a journalist - Forgive me - Good night Thank you Don't mention it The Count of Bassano. A romantic soul! Very romantic Every evening for years, he brought her a very rare flower... ''Rubens Pistilla'' You saw it in her cabin But l don't believe he ever loved her Maybe he is in love with her, now she has gone Ambiguous individual Very ambiguous! With the excuse of setting up a museum... ...he managed to be a kept man for years No, this is nothing... they're just notes l was writing something... for my diary ''l write, l narrate... ''But what do l want to narrate? ''A sea voyage? ''A voyage of life? ''But this isn't told, it happens, and that's something'' lt's trivial, isn't it? lt's been said before...and better! But everything has been said and done before Here we are in the famous and smoky engine-room l don't feel very well These boilers are never turned off How many hours do they work in here? They're so used to being in here that on deck they get sick - Captain, we have a request - What did you say? - Let Mrs Cuffari sing - Shout up We want to hear Mrs Cuffari sing! lt's a pointless request. You'd never be able to hear her Madam, sing something for us! Please, pretty lady! Well done, very well done! Crikey, what lungs! Well done The watchman is Turkish - What did he say? - That the beast won't eat lt needs some fresh air Who will take it walkies on deck? The other day, he told us the beast was in love Look how dejected he is! Don't you ever wash him? My friend, you're having a bad time, eh? - We got him from up... - l get like this when l drink All animals suffer aboard ship Even the separation from its mates can make it... Excuse me, we'd like to go out Excuse me. l will take you We have to take the young animal to Amsterdam These pachyderms give us a lot of work on ship Remember when we took the elephant on board at Alcyone? - No - No, it was Brescia! During the trip, a small rodent paid the elephant a visit The beast broke free of its chains... ...and knocked two sailors into the sea Are there mice here too? Unfortunately, mice love travelling by ship Yes! He's in love! Does it have this effect on him? - Love in the sense of decadence - Who says so? When l fall in love, l feel stronger. Love is health Who is this girl? He's in love En garde, sir. Touch'e - And now... - Stay where you are! - What are you doing here? - Help! Let go of me. l will explain it to you l'm a reporter l just want to meet the Grand Duke and interview him - We caught him here - Can't you help me? He's unarmed, l don't think he is dangerous He claims he is a journalist. He wants to interview the Grand Duke l am a respectable passenger on this ship... ...and a well-known journalist My job is to inform our readers of what goes on in the world A journalist in here? This is serious He's a journalist who wants to interview the Grand Duke Highness, there's an ltalian reporter who wishes to interview you - He's still a suspicious character - Your Highness! l will grant him one, but only through an interpreter - Let him go - Release him - My apologies - Don't mention it The Grand Duke has granted you an interview - l will act as interpreter - Thank you You can start lnterviews! lf he only knew l know less than anyone else We know Your Highness was a great admirer of our artist The fact that you wanted to honour her... ...with your illustrious presence has moved us all ln the name of your extraordinary humanity, allow me to ask you... ...for a word of comfort, of hope... ...for those who do not know what fate has in store... ...and who feel threatened by the international situation Thank you lt is said that most of humanity is unhappy... ...and in need of a word of comfort What exactly is your question? What is your question? How does he see the international situation? Thank you He would like Your Highness's comments on international affairs We are all sitting on the edge of a mountain The Grand Duke says, ''We are all sitting on the edge of a mountain'' Excuse me for interrupting The Grand Duke said, ''mouth'' According to Count Kuntz... ...the Grand Duke said, ''the mouth of a mountain'' l thought he said, ''edge'' What mouth? He wants a comment on the international crisis The Grand Duke used a metaphor He said we are sitting on the edge of a mountain He says it was only a metaphor lt doesn't matter if it's edge or mouth. But l heard ''edge'' - Mouth - No, edge - Mouth - Edge German is my second language! And he said ''edge''! He said ''mouth''! What does he mean? l think he means... Does the Triple Entente wish to renounce its commitment? Do you want to abandon ltaly to its fate? The journalist is asking... Translate it The Grand Duke says, ''Pum, pum'' The mouth of a mountain lt's the crater of a volcano! We are sitting on a crater! Now l understand! lt's a tragedy! The mouth of a mountain... is a catastrophe! The interview is over The interview is over - The interview is over - Of course, thank you Look at Mama Look Shall we try it, maestro? Mr Orlando... My darling, thank you! The second day of the voyage and all is well To remember these moments, they take photos There are four of them! They leap about like me when l am in bed with the Swedish girl! Fuciletto, the tenor, would like to be a dolphin And the two singing teachers, whale hunters After a couple of days at sea... ...you feel like you have been sailing for ages And that you have always known your travelling companions - Captain! - Good morning - Hold it like that, please - Just a minute My grandfather loved being painted He spent half his life posing for painters The poses lasted a bit longer than these - That's wonderful - How do l look? Our people would be much happier... ...if the power were in these delicate hands. We are all waiting for that day - Smile, Father - l am smiling We always lose when you deal Mr Orlando, come with us Our Russian says his voice is so deep it sends people into catalepsy - Good morning - Good morning everybody A hen - Please - What? - A live hen - He wants a live hen We are sorry to interrupt your gastronomic activities... ...but we need a hen for an experiment - A very important experiment - l have to put it here You can watch too. We've got the captain's permission Bring a hen! l don't want to tell you what's going to happen, it's a surprise Does the chef agree? Thank you. Thank you, everyone Come here. We have to film the event What are they doing? Put it on the marble slab No, turn it to face me Now, may l ask for a moment of silence Maybe she will lay an egg Look. She's fallen asleep Amazing! Poor chicken! She's closed her eyes! - He's fallen over - Get a doctor! Get him away from the stove Keep his feet above his head - A drop of water - Have you any smelling-salts? Give him a cognac. l noticed he was pale... Splash some water on his face - Sir, take a deep breath - You have to be used to being in here Even Gasparone ended up with his face on the ricotta cheese He's feeling better The hen's asleep He did it, it's fallen asleep - He put it to sleep - You were sleeping too l don't think you will be satisfied with yesterday's rehearsal either When you sing to remember Edmea... ...l'm sure you want to express not only your talent but also your gratitude... ...to the greatest artist of all time Are you ready, lldebranda? What's that strange smell? - How old am l? - What? - l don't understand - Tell me l don't know. l can't guess people's age Don't be afraid, guess How old do l look then? l don't know My father's age How old is your father? He always looks young to me Excuse me... Mama! - Go and get your cape, my dear - l'm not cold The air is damp Look at these colours, my dears Every sunset brings the signature of the divinity You know, Mr Orlando, l always paint on Saturdays l would like to do a painting like this But how could l compete with the Great Craftsman? - Now let's try the Domine Deus They're rehearsing Excuse me a minute Lepori, stand next to Fuciletto lt's the oratory Captain, l was awake all night again... ...with that tapping on the porthole window lt's our seagull, lcarus We call him that because he once broke a wing Can't you smell something nasty? What is this pong? Can't you smell it? Where's this awful smell coming from? - lt's fish - You can't breathe - What is this pong? - Why are you looking at me? l'm not, but there's a pong in here He says there's a pong, then looks at me! l don't pong! - ldiot! - You're the idiot! l'll pull off your dandy moustache! l think this terrible smell is coming from outside Unfortunately, you will have to tolerate this stench But there is no danger of infection Absolutely none By evening, all the pulp waste will have been dumped The doctor suggests we take the rhino out of the hold We are carrying out the operation, Captain We'll strap it up on the scales and lift it onto the deck lt will be over very quickly and efficiently Here it is! Get the pumps ready! Keep the ropes taut! lncrease the pressure Men, make a cordon! The passengers must be kept behind it - Are they throwing it in the sea? - No, putting it in a lifeboat There! - That's the pong! - lt's getting better though The flying dragon! You could do with a wash, too! Everyone's watching you, stand up She went from A below the stave... ...up as far as E flat above top C... ...to E natural, to F above top C lt was a miracle! The orchestra was almost silent The audience held its breath, and l listened, quite unable to move! l will remember it for the rest of my life Excuse me, maestro, how could she do it? She covered three octaves without any effort...it's not human! Why, was Edmea an ordinary woman? Many people tried to understand her but failed She must have had a secret That's exactly what l want to ask you, maestro What could l do to... One night, Edmea told me that when she was singing... ...a sea snail appeared before her eyes - A sea snail? - That's what she said ''l see a sea snail ''l follow the spiral up and up with my eyes... ''...and my voice goes up and up with it, without any effort'' lt was not merely a matter of lungs, diaphragm and vocal cords She was a phenomenon of catalysis of energy All l know is that Edmea was different from everyone else She was unique. There will never be another singer like her Yes? May l? How come you're so quiet? You look like a wonderful Egyptian sphinx You are splendid Things changed on the third night of the voyage Everything became more strange - l nearly had kittens - She didn't want to come Be careful, he is already in a trance - ls he sick? - Sit down here. Hold hands - Maestro, hold Madame's hand - Me, too? - Aren't you sitting with us? - l would prefer not to take part lf Mother Angela finds out, she will put me on bread and water for a week Come on, ask some questions Edmea, forgive me, but l have always wanted to ask you Which opera pained you the most? What a stupid question that was! She once told me... - What fell? - l don't know Don't break the chain, it's dangerous - Goodness no! - lt's a book! Look, it's the Mona Lisa lt's opened on the Mona Lisa. Look - The Mona Lisa - He is an amazing medium l can't stay, this is terrible Can l ask her a question too? He says no because he's crafty l knew her well and l would have asked her one of those questions... Look, that's how she used to thank the audience Who is it? Turn the light on Who was it? Tell me who it was - Who was it? - They were playing a joke on us Calm down, silly! lnes, don't faint - ls it you? - Leave me alone Show yourself, you fool! Here's our ghost Leave her alone - We should applaud him - lt's sacrilegious l fell for it too You gave us a fright! Curse you You too, maestro, you're still shaking And lnes... She has fainted You mustn't talk The breathing must be paced to the movements of the legs - Where did this child appear from? - l have never seen her before What are you doing here at this hour? Who are you? She is very pretty You are very pretty! Look what pretty plaits you have - She is a darling - Wolfgang, leave her alone What is your name? Do you want to cause a disaster? - l don't understand you - Do not light fires here How is everything? Pull it! Harder! Come on! Good morning - Do you want some water? - Where did you come from? - llia, who are these people? - l don't know They're Serbians - Come up? - Let's go and find out We are sorting a place out for them in the hold... ...so they won't disturb the routine on the ship and the passengers' privacy Captain, how did they get on board? After the murder of the Austrian Archduke at Sarajevo... ...Austria has declared war on Serbia The people, terrorised by the troops... ...are trying to reach the ltalian coast by sea l don't understand - What language do they speak? - Serbian - How did they get on board? - We picked them out of the sea We believe they are refugees Good morning, miss. Are you asleep? The ship's doctor is examining them My officers have spoken to them through interpreters They are shepherds, peasants and gypsies We picked them out of the sea during the night There are also students persecuted by the police, too You cannot force us to travel with these people... ...whose whereabouts we are unsure of - He is right - Their rafts were sinking lt was my duty to save these women... ...these children and these desperate families Last night's Pomard wine was not one of the best l suggest my wife and friends try the Chablis l shall have the usual champagne One of them told me his grandfather was ltalian Go away! Look You do not deserve to eat spaghetti Monica, sit down Aureliano, turn round My nanny was Croatian What does this pretty brunette want? She's pretty, eh? To those wild eyes! lt's embarrassing to eat while they watch Divine Providence will take care of them too lt is thinking about it, in fact They have made their minds up at last But...why? To your mouth! No! What are you doing? l want to see my girlfriend! Violet, please Andrew, what do you think she is going to do? l think she wants to take some food to those people outside Violet, your gesture is very kind, but rather over the top Sir, l will see to it Violet... Please, tell her to come back Milady, please, Sir Reginald wants... l don't need any help. Waitress, follow me There's a soup kitchen out there already Today they will have something more - l insist - Open the door, please Excuse me - Thank you - Milady, please! Mama, can l take them my soup? - Do you think l should do it too? - No! lt's not right - Let me take it - Be quiet! Give me the tray, l will take it l will come with you then Sailor, tell these people to keep back We'll see if you're a singer, too. Do this Open your mouth Keep back! There's enough for everybody Excuse me Madam, please go back into the hall How many do you want? Officer, hand out the cakes to everyone Yes? Why are you laughing? What? What is it? What have you seen? Why is she laughing? lt's unacceptable that a ship be boarded by Serbian anarchists... ...without the captain preventing them The captain is obliged to pick up the shipwrecked... ...because naval law obliges us to save people Captain, some murderers are hiding... ...among those people whom you consider refugees - That's right - You put His Highness in danger We shall complain to your government l will answer to His Highness's safety on this ship When the shipwrecked people boarded... ...l ordered my officers to inspect them... ...in order to spot any potential danger That's a rather superficial check The refugees are wandering freely about the ship ln the bars, the corridors, the halls Chef, tell these people that they can't stay here You have to go up on deck Get up! Go and call five sailors Good morning. l would like a tin of biscuits We have these chocolate ones - Will they do? - Yes, thank you - Would you rather have drowned? - Take them below deck Thank the captain for saving our lives Get out, it's forbidden to stay here Get out! Don't make us force you, get back below deck Take them on deck Tell them we will sort them out below deck You mustn't go beyond these ropes... ...without asking the duty officer's permission - Translate that! - Yes, sir - Take these rags down! - They belong to my son Did they understand that? Come here, pretty one Do you like biscuits? Take them, they're all yours - Taste them. What a pretty dress! - What do you want? ls this your little girl? Pretty! l was giving her some biscuits. Take them You can't trust ltalians l knew there would be problems on this voyage - Come on, aren't you making a move? - Give me time to think Your Highness Excuse me, for security reasons... ...l have to ask you not to leave your cabin... ...until the situation on deck is under control lsn't that going too far? But thank you anyway Please forgive me l do not feel that there is any danger There... Checkmate l cannot play with you. You always win As you look for a piece you move everything around - What's the matter? - l'm scared Of what? l don't know, it is so complicated lt is not complicated Listen, do you remember? ln the 5th century the Serbians invaded Epirus and Thessaly So they are not going to stay confined to the stern l once had a fever of 40, but l could not ruin the show The audience was there to see me, so l carried on... ...and they asked me for seven encores The strength of character and gracefulness make the Englishwoman... There is no need to waste time beating about the bush She's so expressive, l seem almost to understand what she's singing My brother is fast asleep We can't postpone the decision any more, the voyage is reaching an end Count von Strauffen will become more and more suspicious lt will all be sorted out in our favour... ...without us having to do anything about it How can you be so sure? l had a dream - l was in a garden with my brother An eagle came down from the sky lt grabbed my brother and flew away with its great wings But he is so heavy And the eagle dropped him... ...he fell and was swallowed up by a huge hole You have the power to cheer me up and make me believe anything you say Well done! What a fine colour of voice! Who was singing? They're acrobats, monkeys! They all dance, even the old people But they don't know it's a very old dance of pagan origins They mix it with Hungarian dances lt is a ritual dance for the sowing. lt goes like this Good You dance better than Lipiscinskaya! Go down, show them how it's supposed to be done - You too, professor. - Well done! Attention, please! Let me introduce two masters of the dance! They will teach you to dance! They used to dance to make it rain over the fields The women keep their arms raised... ...as though they were collecting water The men beat the earth with their feet... ...so that the seeds realise the dance has begun Then they open their mouths and drink the rain. Like this! l have nothing to teach them... ...but maybe l can learn something from this little brunette Excuse me lt seems as though he's about to tell you a secret, but then... Eugenio, what are you doing? Don't scare me! Answer your cousin! Come here, lovely brunette! Feeling better? The aim of this dance... ...is to make friends with the spirits that control the seeds' growth Don't be a child and tell lies l didn't get her the job, l swear on my mother's life How could a handsome man like you lose your head... ...for a whore like Ms Righini Biagetti? - What about us? - Oh no! Mrs Dongby, may l have this dance? l do whatever l want and give away cigarette lighters to whoever l want That sailor reminded me of my cousin, can l not give him a present? l do not wish to be watched over as though l were a child l am 40 years old, leave me alone! - Dorotea! - Good evening - Sir, would you do me the honour... - No - Of course - Thank you Mama, that's enough. Sit down, please Visna... Look Piltro! A battleship! What will happen? - Open up! - Here l am There's a warship What's wrong? What are they signalling? lt's the admiral of the Austro-Hungarian fleet They want us to hand over the Serbians Go down to the telegraph room The Serbians will be handed over to the officers of the warship lt's an Austro-Hungarian warship, but you mustn't be afraid This gentleman says we mustn't be afraid They won't harm us - They want to throw us in jail! - What did he say? He said we'll be taken prisoner l will go and see Captain! Captain... We are communicating with the warship - What are you saying to each other? - l don't know. But it is all in order Why are they scared? Rome is telling me to play for time. Don't let anybody up We are sending messages, but l don't know what's contained in them The gentlemen should be reassured The captain seemed very relaxed to me Mr Orlando, what do you think is going on? Are you acting mysteriously too? Next to the warship's command deck... ...you can see the flags for signalling l can't hand over the Serbians. Transmit that Hand over immediately The Grand Duke - Good morning - The captain is waiting for you The Austrian warship is ordering us to hand over the Serbians Signal my presence aboard and the destination of this voyage Communicate the destination of this ship Signal to the warship that we are heading for Erimo lsland This way, Your Highness l want to see They are authorising us to proceed and salute the Grand Duke They are authorising us to proceed and salute His Highness Let us continue our voyage They knew and loved Edmea on that warship, too The Grand Duke had obtained a truce from the Austrian admiral... ...in order to carry out our funeral ceremony We would soon be in sight of Erimo - Take that daisy out - Why should it bother you? She once said to me, ''You're always talking about my voice ''But at times l feel it is not my voice at all ''l am a voice, a diaphragm, a breath ''l don't know where the voice comes from ''l am only an instrument ''A mere girl who is even afraid of this voice ''All my life l have been obliged to do what it wanted me to'' Squad, halt! Sir Dongby, the ceremony has begun Mr Partexano, you may proceed At ease! Attention! Hats off! A Psalm of David ''The Lord is my shepherd, l shall not want ''He maketh me to lie down in green pastures ''He leadeth me beside the still waters ''He restoreth my soul ''He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness ''For his name's sake'' Lord, answer my prayer Man is but dust and ashes Dust to dust, ashes to ashes The Lord will protect my exit and my entrance for all eternity - Carry on - Man the side Sailor Over here, madam Would you sprinkle the ashes on the cushion Hats on! Right turn! To the left, forward march! Count Von Huppenback Please go to your cabin and remain there until further orders What is the meaning of this? On the orders of Princess Herzog, you are under arrest At this point... ...it would have been nice if the hearts of the Austrians... ...had also been touched And their warship had sailed away... ...with an emotional salute But it didn't happen that way They wanted the Serbians. They really did! And it would have been even nicer... ...if we, faced with such arrogance, had said... ''No, you're not having them!'' But the warship had to arrest the Serbians lt was an order from the Austro-Hungarian police... ...and on board was the Grand Duke who represented the Empire Mirko! Let go! Pull away! Let go! Let go! As l was saying... lt's almost impossible to reconstruct the exact sequence of events lt appears it was the thoughtless gesture of the young Serbian terrorist... ...who threw a rudimentary bomb at the warship But could such a simple and crude bomb... ...have caused such an historical catastrophe? Are we sure it was the boy who threw the bomb? And if he was recently in love, why would he head for such disaster? lt would appear so lt seems the bomb that fell inside the warship... ...exploded under the breech of a cannon... ...automatically causing it to fire Others say that the shot from the first cannon... ...automatically set the warship's whole battery off Others claim there was neither a Serbian terrorist nor a bomb... ...and that the warship deliberately provoked... ...an international incident Then there is the fourth version l hardly have the courage to mention lt seems that... Gentlemen, carry out your orders! Two words before l finish Many of the people you saw on the ship were saved A seaplane picked up the survivors from the lifeboat Aurora The lifeboat Stella del Nord arrived safely at Ancona Unfortunately that was the last l heard of the others As for me, l have some good news for you Did you know that rhinos produce excellent milk? AND THE SHlP SAlLS ON
