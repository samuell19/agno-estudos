GRACE FRASER: The thrill of adultery is that it exists in the shadow. -(CLOCK TICKING) -♪ (TENSE MUSIC PLAYS) ♪ JONATHAN FRASER: We can lose ourselves sometimes. But it doesn't undo who we are. HALEY FITZGERALD: People conceal the ugly truths... (CAMERA SHUTTERS FLASH) ...to protect themselves. GRACE: (WHISPERING, ECHOING) I will fix this. I'll fix this. DAVE GROHL: The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. It's not just a place, it's an idea. It holds the stories, the images, the sights, and the sounds of decades and decades of music. The story of rock and roll is really many stories. It's the story of pain and beauty, the story of rebellion and unity. The story of noise and harmony, of resistance and community. Every year since 1986, some of the greatest artists that music has produced get inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. This rock and roll family of ours, like so many others, unfortunately can't gather together in person to induct the Hall of Fame class of 2020. Still, we honor this year's inductees by telling their inspiring stories and showing how powerfully they've affected us all. The lives and music of this year's class is the story of contemporary R&B, and the story of hip hop. The story of rock and soul, and the story of glam rock. The story of electronic music, and the story of brutal industrial rock. The artists are all very different, but they share one crucial virtue in common: the undying spirit of rock and roll. Tonight, we celebrate this new class of the Rock Hall as we've never done before. And as we tell their stories, we tell ours, too. Welcome to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame 2020 Inductions. ♪ (THEME MUSIC PLAYING) ♪ ♪ And I... ♪ ♪ Uh! Uh! ♪ LUKE BRYAN: Is there anybody who doesn't have a favorite Doobie Brothers song? The Doobies are one of those iconic American bands that seem to have been with us forever, making incredible music always streaming out of the radio, and always playing spectacular live shows. The Doobie Brothers would be the first to tell you that their band's name is the very definition of, "It seemed like a good idea at the time." But when you're young and having a great time playing biker bars, there's no way to know that the music you're making will still be loved half a century later. The band has been passed down from generation to generation of fans, because their music has never stopped sounding fresh. It seems like there isn't any style of music this band can't master and incorporate into a sound that is immediately identifiable as the Doobie Brothers. I've loved the Doobie Brothers from the first time I heard them as a kid. I've had the privilege of playing with them onstage, and I can honestly say that they're great guys as well as great musicians. This year marks their 50th anniversary as a band, an amazing achievement in itself. They've paid their dues, and they've worked their asses off. But the Doobies always found a way to evolve and progress, and their fans were always out there waiting for them, because their songs are built to last. You know, in my opinion, this induction is... It's long overdue, boys. But I'm thrilled to be the guy who gets to say, the Doobie Brothers have made it. Welcome to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. TOM JOHNSTON: We're what you'd call an American band, I always think of the Doobies as being an American band. PATRICK SIMMONS: We were a hard-rockin' band, a hardworking band. ANNOUNCER: The Doobie Brothers! We just played whatever tickled our fancy. There wasn't anything this band could not play. It was the best group of people I'd ever worked with in the music business. JOHN MCFEE: We do seem to make people really have a great time. JUDD APATOW: They were just the band that had the greatest hits album where every song was the greatest song you ever heard. JOHNSTON: San Jose is where the Doobie Brothers came together. That's how it all started. JOHN HARTMAN: We got together with a guy named Tom Johnston and played a lotta clubs around San Jose for five dollars a night. We worked once a week. JOHNSTON: Well, we played the Chateau a lot, where the Hells Angels would come up. SIMMONS: Somehow, we connected. I think because we were bikers ourselves. HARTMAN: We got a break with a production company in San Mateo who put us on our first album. ♪ Oh! ♪ ♪ Nobody ♪ ♪ Nobody gonna take my love Away from me ♪ We were playing live. We were playing a lot of this heavy electric blues and all this kinda stuff, but that's not what we played on the album. The better part of the album didn't fit the biker image by a long shot. The pressure increased to produce a good song. Like most songs, I was sitting in my bedroom and I had the acoustic. I came up with the initial riff. ♪ Don't you feel it growing Day by day... ♪ JOHNSTON: I call Teddy up, and usually about 3:00 in the morning, I'd usually wake him up. I said, "This is a single, Teddy." It's the only time I ever said that. TED TEMPLEMAN: Tommy had "Listen to the Music" already completely finished. We didn't have to do anything with that thing except just lay it down, and then Pat had all these ideas to put layer upon layer of guitars. ♪ Whoa-oh Listen to the music ♪ ♪ Whoa-oh Listen to the music ♪ ♪ Whoa-oh Listen to the music ♪ ♪ All the time... ♪ BRAD PAISLEY: It's so infectious. That's truly the recipe for a big pop hit. When you establish your sound with something like "Listen to the Music", the sky's the limit. JOHNSTON: We had the three-part harmony thing going on, which was a big part of what we've always done. And then I was doing the chaka-chaka rhythm thing that I sort of invented, trying to play drums on the guitar while playing guitar. (SCATTING) The drums will be coming in like this. (SCATTING) ♪ Do-do-do do do do do do ♪ ♪ Do-do-do do do do do do ♪ ♪ Do-do-do do do do do do ♪ APATOW: Probably my favorite Doobie Brothers song is "Jesus Is Just Alright." Why? I don't know. I'm a Jewish kid from Long Island. ♪ Jesus is just all right with me ♪ ♪ Jesus is just all right ♪ ♪ Oh, yeah ♪ JOHNSTON: Between '72 and '73, we went from the Winnebago stage to the public airline stage. And by '74, we had the Doobieliner. ♪ Without love ♪ ♪ Where would you be now? ♪ SIMMONS: Party on the plane every day. ♪ Without love ♪ -♪ Talking 'bout China Grove ♪ -♪ China Grove ♪ ♪ Whoa Yeah, yeah ♪ -♪ China Grove ♪ -♪ I believe you said ♪ JOHNSTON: The playing was better. The singing was better. The whole concept was better. JEFF "SKUNK" BAXTER: The depth of guitar playing was profound. Three guitar players all playing different styles, but playing their parts. John was a big proponent of two drummers. HARTMAN: The advantage of playing with two drummers is that you have the mass of acoustic viability. Now, the disadvantages of course are, if he goes "eh", you better go "eh" with him. If he goes "oom", you better go "oom" with him! Because if not, you're gonna get "eh, oom, uh," all at the same time. And that's no good. ♪ Yeah ♪ You know, every guitarist in the world has to know... ♪ (PLAYING RIFF FROM "BLACK WATER") ♪ (CROWD CHEERING) ♪ Well, I built me a raft ♪ ♪ And she's ready for floating... ♪ NANCY WILSON: That's what America feels like. That song. It just brought so many good elements together that people could really relate to. I mean, how many people have ever written chord changes that are iconic? Pat Simmons' acoustic on that is phenomenal. ♪ Old black water Keep on rollin' ♪ ♪ Mississippi moon ♪ ♪ Won't you keep on Shinin' on me? ♪ ♪ Old black water Keep on rollin' ♪ ♪ Mississippi moon ♪ ♪ Keep on shinin' on me ♪ ♪ Keep on shining Your light... ♪ JOHNSTON: Roanoke started playing "Black Water" on their own. Nobody asked them to. SIMMONS: All of a sudden, out of this little station somewhere in the South, "Black Water" was in their top-ten rotation. Next thing we know, it's our first number-one record. And also, a real departure in style from anything we'd done up to that point. It really featured Pat's finger-pickin'. You had to dance. You had to dance to that song. Everybody had to go... ♪ Hear some funky Dixieland ♪ ♪ Pretty mama, Come and take me by the hand ♪ -♪ By the hand ♪ -♪ Hand ♪ ♪ Take me by the hand ♪ ♪ Pretty mama, come and dance With your daddy ♪ ♪ All night long... ♪ JOHNSTON: The crowds got way larger. Crowds got more animated. And pretty soon, we were on the road all the time. ♪ I know you're leavin' ♪ ♪ Leavin' me behind... ♪ Being on the road's a tough thing. And after a while, it gets so crazy that you start just going inward. ♪ Take me in your arms ♪ ♪ Rock me Rock me a little while ♪ ♪ Oh, with you, darling ♪ ♪ Rock me Rock me a little while ♪ ♪ Oh, yeah, yeah ♪ TIRAN PORTER: The Doobie Brothers played everywhere where there was an electrical outlet. Sometimes, it's just too much. MAN: Well, Tommy became very ill. SIMMONS: We were out promoting Stampede and Tommy didn't show up at the gig in Chicago. So, we didn't know what to do. I finally ended up in a hospital and we found out, yeah, about a dime-sized hole in your stomach. And they just barely pulled me out of it. I was basically dead and I said, "You know what? I'm burnt out on this. I gotta get away from it for a while." And I did. It looked like we would have to cancel the tour. And Jeffrey Baxter said, "I know this guy. He's a side man with Steely Dan. His name is Michael McDonald." He's a really good piano player and a wonderful singer. I think you'll like him. PORTER: So we brought Michael out to New Orleans in early 1975. Heard him sing three notes and we went, (GASPS) "That's the guy!" (AUDIENCE CHEERS) MICHAEL MCDONALD: This was just like a dream come true. You know, I got to play with a really great band, record my own material. I thought I'd died and went to Heaven. ♪ Oh, you ♪ ♪ Tell me, please, the things You're gonna do for me ♪ ♪ No, no ♪ ♪ I ain't blind and I don't like What I think I see ♪ ♪ Taking it to the streets ♪ ♪ We're taking it To the streets ♪ ♪ Taking it to the streets ♪ MCDONALD: It all happened so fast. I think I was expecting at any time to be laid off. You know, and yet it just kept going further and further. Michael McDonald is kinda like adding a spice to a dish. And it's not a subtle spice. He's a sort of wasabi-infused garlic. Immediately, it changes everything. And he did. ♪ No, no ♪ -♪ Taking it to the streets ♪ -♪ No, no ♪ ♪ Taking it to the streets... ♪ Wow! The Doobie Brothers! One of the key moments of my television history was the What's Happening!! episode where they went to see the Doobie Brothers and they bootlegged the show. You got to see the Doobie Brothers act. I thought you guys were our friends. How could you guys do this to us? And I can't say it was strong! JACKSON BROWNE: Will you welcome some really good friends of all of ours, who helped us get this whole thing started from the beginning. Put it together for the Doobie Brothers! ♪ Darling, you're always there At my rescue ♪ ♪ Dependin' on you ♪ ♪ Darling, you're always there By my side ♪ ♪ You're always there By my side... ♪ Here was the biggest band in the United States saying, "Yeah, we'll give you two nights at Madison Square Garden." It let us go on sale and say that our first nights were with the Doobie Brothers. PORTER: The Minute by Minute album was probably the most fraught recording experience of our career. ♪ She came from somewhere Back in her long ago ♪ "What a Fool Believes," fifty-something takes. ♪ The sentimental fool Don't see ♪ ♪ Tryin' hard to recreate What has yet to be created ♪ PORTER: Michael had something in his head, but he couldn't communicate it to the rest of us. The quest for excellence was out of control. PORTER: We were all sick of one another. MCDONALD: Jeff and I butted heads during that period more than anyone else in the band. He was now in a lot of ways driving the direction of the band. I don't think the album could have ever been good enough, you know, for any of us. And I think even a lot of people at the label were going, "It's over. It's the band's, you know, kiss of death." The Doobie Brothers! ♪ What a fool believes ♪ ♪ He sees ♪ ♪ No wise man has the power... ♪ So imagine our surprise when the first single came out and the thing sold like three million copies. No one expected it. Much less did we ever expect to win a Grammy, you know. BOTH: The Doobie Brothers! We want to thank our fans who made it all possible, stickin' with us for all these years. Thanks. We appreciate it. ♪ Call my name And I'll be gone ♪ ♪ You'll reach out And I won't be there ♪ ♪ Just my luck, you'll realize ♪ ♪ You should spend your life With someone... ♪ SIMMONS: It might have been me that kinda was always pushing to kinda keep the band working. And I just kinda felt, at that point, that maybe it was time to give people a break. Goddammit, man. The Doobie Brothers broke up. Shit! When did that happen? SIMMONS: Yo! Everybody knows my friend, your good friend, -Mr. Tommy Johnston. -(AUDIENCE CHEERING) ♪ When the sun comes up On a sleepy little town ♪ ♪ Down around San Antone ♪ ♪ And the folks are risin' For another day ♪ ♪ Round about their homes... ♪ SIMMONS: Because of the way that we did things, it would enable us to come back and play together again. -♪ Talking 'bout China Grove ♪ -♪ China Grove ♪ WILSON: They're such a seminal treasure of a rock band, and they belong in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Because they invented that shit. ♪ Whoa, oh Listen to the music ♪ Now they've been together 50 years! I can't imagine rock and roll without the Doobie Brothers. We were a band. And we're still that way. I mean, this band is a live band. MCDONALD: You know, for me, it was the greatest time in my career, was being a Doobie Brother. As long as people want to hear us, we'll be out there playing. (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) Wow, it's been a long time coming, but we are so grateful and excited to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. A lot of our musical influences are enshrined in the Hall, so we couldn't ask for better company. It's been quite a ride from playing clubs in San Jose to recording music that we loved, then playing for people in venues all over the world. It seems unreal, but it's been quite a trip, and we aren't done yet. My deepest thanks to the Doobie Brothers family and all the members over the years who have been part of this journey. It's always been about our love of music, and because of the band's success, we now celebrate this induction. I want to thank my family for their support. My wife, Diane. My son, Christopher, and his family. And my daughter, Lara. You guys mean the world to me. And I'd like to thank Irving Azoff and Karim Karmi for getting us to this level in our career. You've been amazing. I'd also like to thank Rob Light and the CAA team. And thanks to Ted Templeman for his musical direction in the studio. And to all our fans who have stood by the band through the years, you are the best. Thank you all. I wish to thank first of all the guys who I accept this award with tonight, for their years of friendship and the privilege of allowing me to be a member of the Doobie Brothers. I'd also like to thank the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame for this great honor. I'd like to thank the fans for their continuous support over the years. And I'd also like to thank all the managers, record executives, producers, all the men and women who worked hard along with us on the way to this moment. It's a great honor. On a personal note, I'd like to thank my lovely wife Amy, and my two great kids, Dylan and Scarlett. Thank you for always being there. Being a Doobie Brother represents some of the best years of my life, so being inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame tonight with these guys makes it all the more special for me. Thank you. First of all, I want to thank the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame for our induction. It's certainly a great honor for us to be included among this distinguished membership. I want to thank all the Doobie Brothers past and present, especially Tom Johnston, Michael McDonald, John McFee, Mike Hossack, John Hartman, Keith Knudsen, Tiran Porter, Bobby LaKind and Jeff Baxter. And it's truly an honor to have been part of this great band of amazingly talented musicians and wonderful friends. We have the greatest road crew in rock 'n' roll: Joe, Tyler, Hoodie, Vid, Jeremy, John, Coop, Keith and Steve. Thanks, guys. And our incredible fans who got us here and stuck with us for over 50 years, we owe you so much. I want to thank my wonderful wife, Cris, forever patient, wise and supportive. I love you so much. My children, Lindsey, Josh and Pat Jr., you have made all the work, long hours and sacrifice worth it. My life has been a blessing and I'm so lucky to be able to share it with you all. I want to wish all of you watching the very best. Someday, we'll all be together again, sharing the music and the love. Thank you. Aloha. IGGY POP: When I first heard about Nine Inch Nails and heard a little of their music, I thought, "Well, who is this guy?" So I took a look. And I saw a face straight out of 15th-century Spain. I think Trent could have played Zorro. If he'd been alive at the right time, I think he could have been painted by Velázquez or El Greco. And his portrait would probably be hanging in the Prado today. Listening to Nine Inch Nails' music, which is so often called industrial, I actually hear a lot of funk. Just listen to "Closer", and the foundation could be Stevie Wonder or George Clinton. But on top of that is a focused and relentless process of emotional destruction which paints a portrait of pain, pressure and dissatisfaction. It's the soundtrack to the dark and lonely party that was beginning to play out in America at that period. So I would call it not industrial, but the sound of industrial, digital ambition. I went to the Nine Inch Nails show in the Forum in Los Angeles, the one together with David Bowie. And Trent held the center of that room just by being a kind of dark spot hunched behind the mic. I'd seen the same thing accomplished in different ways by T. Rex at Wembley, Nirvana at the Pyramid Club, and Bob Dylan in '65. This is the mark of the master artist. Simply to connect. The controversial and brilliant French novelist Michel Houellebecq, when asked the secret of his success, said, "It's easy. Just tell the truth." Listening to Nine Inch Nails feels like hearing the truth. So it gets you a little bit closer to God. It is my honor to assist in inducting Trent Reznor and Nine Inch Nails into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. TRENT REZNOR: Hello? INTERVIEWER: Hey, Trent. REZNOR: Yeah? INTERVIEWER: Thanks for doing this. I'll jump in. How do you explain what Nine Inch Nails is? REZNOR: That's a good question. And it's one of those ones where, when asked, my mind immediately goes blank, you know? (LAUGHS) ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome Nine Inch Nails. RICK RUBIN: Nine Inch Nails was always outsider music. The rest of culture is moving and changing in a certain way. And they were always outside of it. MILEY CYRUS They're a testament that you can make infectious music that you can't get enough of. ♪ Head like a hole ♪ ♪ Black as your soul... ♪ JIMMY IOVINE: Trent has an enormous impact culturally. His psyche is the lead instrument of that band. ♪ Bow down before The one you serve... ♪ "Head Like a Hole" has two fucking choruses. If you're trying to think of that song, it's the song that's like... ♪ Bow down before... ♪ Oh wait, no. Then it's... ♪ Head like a... ♪ Oh, wait. Both of those are great choruses, and they're in the same song. There's... SAUL WILLIAMS: There's that similarity with an artist like Prince, where you know that a lot of those songs came from late-night solo ventures into the self. Trent brings in collaborators and other players, but it is a singular vision, and that vision is his. ♪ Every time I get high... ♪ REZNOR: What I always thought rock should be is something that should be rebellious, and should have something about it that your parents shouldn't like. You know, it should be anti-establishment. It should have some sense of danger. There should be some sense of chaos. Nine Inch Nails is a pure, raw-nerve emotion. It appeals to you and freaks you out at the same time. DAVID FINCHER: There are a lot of people who can write a good lick, or produce something that's eminently hummable. But it's when somebody drops something into your lap... that has to be dealt with, that's the difference. REZNOR: I spent a lot of time growing up in Pennsylvania. You know, like a lot of time by myself. And just time in my room, listening to music. You know, worn-out records... helped me feel less alone. Helped me feel connected to the world in an environment where I felt far away from everything exciting. When I started to express myself, there seemed to be a lot of angst and anger and loneliness in journal entries. I realized these could be the lyrics. ♪ Why are you doing this to me ♪ ANNIE CLARK: Nine Inch Nails came out of the industrial scene of the '80s, and made heavy, corrosive, industrial goth music massively popular, and made it something that suburban kids were wearing t-shirts of. WILLIAMS: It's a huge influence on a generation of kids that needed direction. I mean, I could be funny about it and say, "Yeah, he helped a lotta suburban white kids make sense of their lives," you know? (LAUGHS) And, um... But in a great way though. In a great fuckin' way. ♪ I still recall the taste of your tears... ♪ I was at that age, 14, I was angsty as fuck, and I wanted rebellion music too. It was really like one of those records that you just hear, you go, "Oh, that's what I like now." ♪ My favorite dreams of you ♪ ♪ Still wash ashore... ♪ REZNOR: Heading to a town you've never been to, opening for a band and seeing somebody in the back yelling your words back at you... Like, I can't tell you how much that really made me feel connected to the world for once. ♪ ...anymore ♪ You feel a sense of, "I'm not alone, 'cause someone else has felt this way." Their music kind of erases loneliness in a way. To me, "Closer" was a next jump for him. ♪ Help me get away from myself ♪ ♪ I wanna fuck you like an animal ♪ REZNOR: "Here's a visual in my head." "Let's get that sounding like that place." HOST: The biggest noise this year was made by a musical hermit named Trent Reznor and the band he sometimes surrounds himself with, Nine Inch Nails. Reznor was everywhere this year, debuting at number two on the Billboard chart with The Downward Spiral album, and taking many a luckless keyboard to task on stage. I saw the video of that new band and I thought, "That's really good. That's a great video." Because of that, I then really had gone in to what he was doing. And then Downward Spiral was really just an exceptional album. Really excellent. ♪ Devil speak of the way... ♪ The performance at Woodstock in the mud, that's gonna be in my brain forever. They just created this world that was tumbling towards hell in the best possible way. And at one point, the one Nine Inch Nail, Trent... (AUDIENCE LAUGHS) He's just-- He's very disturbed. He's emotio-- This kid is emotionally disturbed. REZNOR: Touring became life-changing for good and bad. Surreal experience, that I, as a human being, wasn't prepared for. To see your whole life kinda change, fame brings its weirdness to you. It was a strange, strange time. You know, I came out the other end lost. ♪ What have I become ♪ ♪ My sweetest friend ♪ ♪ What have I become ♪ ♪ My sweetest friend... ♪ REZNOR: The whole Johnny Cash thing came up at a time right when what was going through my head was really questioning my own relevance. And I was wondering if I had anything to say, or if I was any good. ♪ I would keep myself... ♪ At the time, it felt really comforting, and like a pat on the back in the way of, like, you know, "You can do this. Get out there and write an album." INTERVIEWER: How do you feel when things you've done come back to you from the culture? Like Miley Cyrus covering one of your songs? Or Lil Nas X sampling Nine Inch Nails? ♪ I got the horses in the back... ♪ REZNOR: It's surprising and it's flattering to hear when influence pops up. But I don't-- I don't spend much time thinking about it. I don't think it's healthy to be caught up in that. ♪ I'm gonna take my horse to the old town road... ♪ You really start to have this deep appreciation for the melodies. And when you have a great melody, it can lend itself to any genre. I think that's how a song becomes classic. ♪ Ride till I can't no more ♪ PROFESSOR: Mr. Zuckerberg, do I have your full attention? No. FINCHER: Ghosts was a collection that I returned to often. And on Social Network, we just kept temping it with stuff from Ghosts. REZNOR: Social Network, the first film I'd ever scored. You know, the first few days was, "I don't have any idea..." "How do you even start?" Once I started thinking about the character, the sense of betrayal and the sense of, here's somebody that believes in something so much that they'll fuck over anybody to do it, thinking it's gonna fix them, and I know that story. I know what that feels like. When I'm sitting in the studio with Atticus now, for the first time in my life, I felt like it really is much better than if I were by myself. IOVINE: I've now seen all their movies. And music that they do for those movies is as interesting and as powerful as Nine Inch Nails. A good way to look at music is to look on the past. NWA, The Clash, Patti Smith. We've have had those moments where complete anarchy of music and the culture collide, and you get people that are ahead of their time. That's where Nine Inch Nails, to me, fits. ♪ Doesn't it make you Feel better ♪ FINCHER: There are best hits, you know, and then there's a body of work. It's a sense of a progression through the not knowing, and the finding the vulnerability of that, and the triumph of it. And it's rare. REZNOR: The best part of touring for me now is the sense of pride of "Man, I cannot wait to show this crowd this band." A lot of times I look in the front row and it largely looks the same as it did 25 years ago. It's not the same people. But it still looks like... There's the same goth kid in the front row who might be his son now. And I still feel like there's so much I haven't done or so much I don't know about music alone. I gotta get my shit together and get going on this. INTERVIEWER: That's great. Well, thanks. We'll leave it there. REZNOR: All right, man. Take care. Bye. INTERCEPT MESSAGE: We're sorry. Your call cannot be completed as dialed. -Please check the number and-- -(BEEP) Thank you so much, Iggy. Hello, everyone. What a disorienting, strange year we find ourselves in. As I've been wrapping my head around Nine Inch Nails being welcomed into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, I think I was most looking forward to the ceremony itself, where hopefully the whole camp, past and present, was going to get together and have a moment. And we're all stuck in our little boxes staring at our screens. Even now, music's always been the thing that keeps me going, and as an artist, I think the most significant accomplishment or feeling is realizing something you've created from a fragile and intimate place has reached out, resonated and affected someone else, possibly changing how they see the world. So, as to whatever being in a Hall of Fame means, thank you for the recognition. With that said, this has been far from a singular endeavor, and I first want to introduce my fellow inductees. Atticus Ross. Robin Finck. Alessandro Cortini. Ilan Rubin. Danny Lohner. And Chris Vrenna. I love these guys, and they've all been an integral and essential part of why we're here. Additionally, there's been a number of other key players involved over the years I'd like to recognize and thank, including Charlie Clouser, James Woolley, Rich Patrick, Josh Freese, Justin Medal-Johnsen, Jerome Dillon, Aaron North, Jeff Ward and Jeordie White. Throughout the years, I've benefitted from a strong collection of people around me that have offered everything from encouragement to guidance, to a kick in the ass when needed. These include Jimmy Iovine, John Silva, Marc Geiger, Ross Rossin, Alan Moulder, Rick Rubin, Zia Modabber, Bill Harper, David Fincher, Jerome Crooks, Steve Barnett, Jim Guerinot, and John Malm. You're all appreciated and this is for you, too. A special thank you to my wife, Mariqueen, and my kids, who keep me humble and make everything worthwhile. And for the Nine Inch Nails fans out there, you guys are the best. We've wound up in some weird places together, and you're an intense bunch that can drive me out of my mind, but you're the best. This journey is far from over if I have any say in it. So let's stop fucking around and patting ourselves on the back and get to it. Hope to see you all in the flesh soon. Thank you. CREW MEMBER: Quiet please. DIRECTOR: Irving Azoff induction, take one. Irving Azoff in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Why not? It wouldn't be the first time they've inducted somebody who can't sing or play an instrument. (MAN SCATTING) (MAN SCREECHING) IRVING AZOFF: I've been an agent, a personal manager and a movie producer. You dick! You sound like a corporate fucking dick! AZOFF: A music publisher and a record company CEO. I love music., And I like to protect the people who make it. I love Irving's sense of play. I love his sense of mischief. I love his enthusiasm. I love his optimism. His perseverance. And I love his loyalty to his clients and to his friends. He makes you feel good about being a fan, because he's a fan. You're important, because he's important! He loves the shit out of music. The consummate professional, and a big dealer. (LAUGHTER) His overall love of what he does... I just am in awe of it every day. AZOFF: As a kid growing up in Danville, Illinois, my first concert was the Beatles in Chicago's old Comiskey Park. I was bitten by the music bug, but I was not a musician. My instrument was, and still is, the telephone. I put myself through college at the University of Illinois, booking bar bands. Together with my friend singer/songwriter Dan Fogelberg, we quit school and headed west to pursue our careers in music. One day, he came to me and said, "Hey, I really want to manage somebody. Could I manage you?" And I said, "Sure. Everybody else does." "No, no, no. they're all dumb. I know what I'm doing." When David Geffen and Elliott recruit me, I take Joe Walsh and Barnstorm, REO Speedwagon and Dan Fogelberg with me to GR Management. Irving is the only manager that I ever knew that said to David Geffen, "Hey, David..." (BLOWS RASPBERRY) DON HENLEY: Things at Geffen/ Roberts Management were coming apart, and Elliott suddenly dissolved the company. So Irving called us up one day and he said, "Are you leaving?" And we said, "Yeah, we're leaving." He said, "Well, I'm going with you." He wanted to start a new kind of management and level the playing field for artists in the record business. ♪ We ought to take it easy... ♪ I grew up with a real appreciation for a song in a distinct vocal. And I loved vocal harmonies. That's what attracted me to the Beatles, and it's what attracted me to The Eagles. Perfection is not an accident. JOE WALSH: And then Irving took a bunch of young men called The Eagles, and turned them into a bunch of old men called The Eagles. That was a good thing. And I see a guy who is kind of in the band. What I loved and what I learned from Irving is... get down with them. Be with your people. Tonight, the promoter gave us chopsticks. CAMERON CROWE: He was this kind of... rocket. Not the tallest rocket. But a compact rocket. More powerful than the taller rocket. HENLEY: Irving Azoff. He's short, and he's a story. CROWE: I wrote about him for Rolling Stone and tried to like capture what that was like. HENLEY: What Irving did was basically genius. He turned a longstanding animosity between the Eagles and Rolling Stone magazine into a big feature piece about himself. ♪ You can check out Any time you like ♪ ♪ But you can never leave ♪ Then the Eagles broke up. Then we got back together... Then we broke up. ♪ Nobody on the road ♪ ♪ The heat is on ♪ NEWSREADER: His reputation as a success recently led to his appointment as head of MCA Records, forcing him to give up his management company. This evening is really a celebration of chutzpah, that spirit which has allowed Irving Azoff to spend 16 years in a ruthless business and land near the top of the heap. Fourteen years later, back together. ♪ Get over it! Get over it! ♪ A lot of my job was trying to keep the band from breaking up. Or putting the band back together after it broke up ten or 20 times. I want to thank Irving Azoff, without whom we wouldn't be here today. We might still be here, we wouldn't have made -as much money. -Right. -(LAUGHTER) -As I've said before, he may be Satan, but he's our Satan. HENLEY: The whole Satan comment has been widely misunderstood. What I meant was, if you mistreat one of Irving's clients, then there will be consequences. Everything I learned about the business I learned managing them. HENLEY: I think we taught him about the dynamic in a band. He'd managed solo artists like Fogelberg and Walsh, but not a band like the Eagles, where there were a lot of chiefs and no Indians. It's been an incredible learning experience to then apply to the other things that I've done throughout my career. If you make a big list of all the artists you know, Irving manages their managers. ♪ Here's to the ones That we got... ♪ ADAM LEVINE: Irving is so disarmingly honest. Since we started working together, the one thing he did very differently was told me the truth, man. And the truth isn't always awesome. Irving came into my life at the most crucial moment. I needed him so bad. ♪ Thank God that I found you... ♪ It's just so great to be able to have somebody in your life when you have so much coming at you. I just trust him. He's so supportive. He gives you great advice. And you always know you're growing with Irving. That's what I love about Irving. Most people know Irving as a powerful manager or a major executive. I know him as a friend. I've seen him go to any length for his artists. And I've seen him be a warm and compassionate father to his children. And to me! (LAUGHS) I called my dad and he said, "How's it going?" And I said, "I gotta be honest with you, I don't know if I'm meant for the music business." And he said, "Listen to me carefully 'cause I'm only gonna tell you this once. You have my last name. You have a phone. If you can't figure it out, you're not my son." Click. And I never forgot that. One more thing. What I do know is, if somebody in the entertainment business does something good... Irving has always made it possible for them, uh, to be able to do it better. I don't think there's anybody in the music business who has made more of a difference over as long a span of time as Irving Azoff. Every place I've worked in the business, whether it's been a label, a publisher, a promoter, a manager, if you do what's right for the creative person, the songwriter, the artist, it will eventually be right for your company and your career also. He has been instrumental in bringing about a new order... about how things work. In terms of recording contracts. In terms of management. In terms of touring. In terms of copyright. In terms of artist rights. The economics in the business have been so hurt, that for the first time, you've got a united music industry of record companies, publishers, writers, artists, you know, standing together. You know, streaming is the future. So, larger than life, loving music the way we love music. Come on, you gotta put him in the Hall of Fame. He is one of the greatest of all time when it comes to managers. There is truly no one more deserving than Irving. And his impact on the industry is literally profound. I've been really lucky to have a front-row seat to this show my entire life. We love him. All the guys in The Eagles love him. He has a beautiful house that we bought him and a beautiful car that we bought him. He has a wonderful life that we made possible for him. Irving, my friend, we're coming up on 47 years together. It's been a hell of a ride. I love ya. I appreciate you, and congratulations on your induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Well deserved. Hi, everyone, Irving here, AKA Don Henley's Satan. I actually prefer Glenn Frey's nickname for me better, "Big Shorty." We're all here because we're fans. We hear a song or a melody and think, this is where I belong. When I was growing up in Illinois, my parents thought I was headed for a career in medicine. As useful as that would be right now, the moment music got ahold of me, it never let go. I'm so lucky to have had a front-row seat to watch my favorite artists on and off the stage for nearly five decades now. These icons became a part of my family and my very best friends. Don Henley, Glenn Frey, Joe Walsh, Dan Fogelberg, Stevie Nicks, Donald Fagan and Walter Becker, you started it all. Three of you are no longer with us in person, but you're always with me in spirit. My mantra since day one has been, "Do what's right for the artist, and in turn, that decision will be right for you." I can honestly say that strategy hasn't failed me once. No one has taught me more about the importance of protecting artists' rights than Don Henley. We've reached a crossroads in the music business today. It's time for rules to be broken, but they won't break themselves. If you are a young artist or executive watching this today, and I can give you any advice, it's be brave. Own as much as you can. Depend on no one but yourselves. Protect intellectual property at all costs. Take the long road. Fear nothing and no one. I promise you, it will pay off. To my family, my wife Shelli. You're my partner in crime. I love you more than anything. Plain and simple, none of this exists without you. To my kids and grandkids, Jay, Allison, Jeffrey, Cameron, Rich, Sydney, Riley and Dylan, I'm so proud of you all. Thank you for not being the fuckups your mother and I worried you could be. Since partnering with my son Jeffrey, working with him breaking new artists has offered some of the most exciting moments of my career. Look at it this way, we could have had real jobs. To the Hall of Fame, thank you. This organization has come so far and found such an important and needed place in the world, a place where we can all celebrate the artists and the music we love. I hereby induct myself into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. I will cherish this moment forever. SEAN COMBS: "It was all a dream" These are the most famous words from the greatest rapper of all time, the Notorious B.I.G. And tonight, that dream is turning into a reality. Big just wanted to be the biggest. He wanted to be the best. He wanted to have influence and impact people in a positive way. And that clearly has been done all over the world.

Even though I didn't get to know him as well as I wanted, through his fans and our family, I was able to see with my own eyes that his music transcended the hip hop industry. And he was able to not just become the king of New York, but the king of the culture. I know if my dad was here, he would want to thank his mom, my grandma, Voletta "Mema" Wallace, Gigi, Uncle Dave, my mom Jan, Faith, Todd, Puffy, Wayne, Mark, the Junior Mafia family, everyone that helped bring his music to life. And of course, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame for this tremendous honor. CJ? Christopher George Latore Wallace. AKA the Notorious B.I.G. AKA Biggie Smalls. AKA Frank Wyatt. AKA the King of New York. Our father was one of the founding fathers of hip hop. He helped revolutionize what was a young artform for the Black community and the world. I'm honored to share his name and his dedication to Black music, creativity, self-expression, and Black freedom. I love you, Mema. Thanks for teaching us who Christopher Wallace was, as a son, friend, poet, artist, and father. BOTH: We love you, Mema. We love you, Dad. Brooklyn, we did it! Depeche Mode is the soundtrack of my adolescence. I'm not kidding. There was literally a song for every occasion of my life. My first date, my first time leaving South Africa, and, of course, the first time I got my heart broken. So when I finally got to see them live a couple of years ago, it was like this epic slap in the face of nostalgia. But more than that, when I was at the show, I realized what else I loved about their music. They celebrate the outsider. Their music brings people together from all different walks of life. It makes them feel like it's okay to be different. That really hit me watching the videos at the concert. I was moved to tears. I came home. I told my daughters about it. And I was also really fucking pissed, because I don't usually go to rock concerts to bawl my eyes out. But truthfully though, it just speaks to the immense power Depeche Mode has had over the years. It is also why, when I got the chance to pick some songs for the Atomic Blonde soundtrack, they were the first on my list. It's no surprise that they're joining the ranks of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. I mean, they should have been there 20 years ago if it was up to me. But what an incredibly well-deserved honor. Thank you, guys, for being the soundtrack to my life. (AUDIENCE CHEERING) (CHANTING) Depeche Mode! Depeche Mode!

MARTIN: I think some bands exist, on a universal level, solely to bring people together, to make people that might feel more outsidery realize that they're part of a bigger family. Depeche Mode can make lost souls feel a bit more found. WOMAN: The music. The notes. The voice. It touched us all. That's why they have a fan like 22-year-old girl like me. I feel like... Depeche Mode just sort of talked about real shit. I think most of us have had times of depression or times of not, you know, not feeling the way society tells you you're supposed to feel all the time. Depeche Mode, in a way, was just saying, "It's okay wherever you're at. If you feel different from everyone around you, you're kinda-- There's other people that feel that way."

When you actually write down a list of, "What are Depeche Mode songs about," it's such a vast array of things.

MARTIN GORE: I've always been very passionate about music, and it's the only thing that's ever really interested me, so I can't imagine doing anything else. FLETCHER: We're lucky, as a band, our fans give us our freedom. They give us the ability to release what we like. GAHAN: I'm very grateful that we get to do this and we still got fans that want to come and see us. We must be doing something right. BUTLER: I feel like their music still sounds like it could come out 20 years from now. Depeche were able to take that spirit and spread it, which is really kind of a sacred responsibility. That mystique and that majesty that they created together is extremely influential on most bands, I think. For a band like us, that makes music that we make, they are like the godfathers. Honestly, when we play in Europe still to this day, the front row is 90 percent Depeche Mode shirts because... they, like, gave us their blessing. All you have to do is put the needle in the groove and let the music speak for itself. They've done a wonderful job seeing things that we may not have seen before and listening to things that we had yet to hear.

GAHAN: And of course, the success of this band. Thanks, Alan. We've been doing this most of our adult lives, pretty much. I guess we were 18, 19 when we started doing this. And, of course, I want to thank Martin and Fletch while I've got the opportunity. -Thanks, Dave. -'Cause I don't know what the hell I would have been doing if I didn't find music, to be quite honest. You'd have been still stealing cars, Dave. Well, yeah, maybe I would have moved on a bit from there. Let's hope I would've been-- Stealing larger things than cars. -Let's hope so. -(LAUGHTER) Definitely something dodgy. I mean, music saved us, you know, -in more ways than one. -GORE: Absolutely. Yeah. Thanks to you, as well. You know, we wouldn't be here either. -Yeah. -GAHAN: Thanks, Mart. You know, we were growing up listening to music on the radio and having music to-- It really kind of helped us to feel normal, and feel part of something. You know, and that's what music does with people and I think that's what Depeche Mode has done for many people. I think it-- Music really brings people together and God knows, we need that more today than it seems any other time. Unfortunately we're not gonna be able to perform for you tonight, of course, because of this situation we find all of ourselves in. But I want to thank some special people here who have supported us and believed in us. Of course, Daniel Miller and Mute Records, who found us and believed in us. And he continues to be a sort of guidance to this day. And Tom Corbin, who, thank God, came in at the right time and actually made us look cool. -(LAUGHTER) -Jonathan Kessler, our manager, of course, and spiritual advisor. All of the promoters across the world that took a chance on a bunch of outsider, eyeliner-wearing weirdos from Essex. And all of the wankers that didn't. (LAUGHTER) Um... I also want to thank Peter Gordeno and Christian Eigner, who have been such a huge part of this band for the last 20 years. And we're still calling them "the new blokes." Let's not forget, as well, all our road crew, tour managers, all of them that have worked tirelessly to bring the Depeche Mode show to life every night. Rob Stringer at Sony, who continues to support our artistic vision. And of course, all of the fans, a lot of which that have been with us from day one. And of course, last but not least, a big thank you to our families, our wives, our kids, our parents, you know, who put up with us and have been with us throughout this journey. And I think I speak for all of us when I say, we love you and we couldn't do it without you. Yes, absolutely. Thank you. Well done. (LAUGHTER) It's a lot. You better get back to your kids and the studio. Fletch, it's opening time! -And you better-- -Off to the pub! Talk to you guys soon. Love you. -All right. -See ya. Cheers SLASH: Eddie Van Halen was a tremendously gifted musician. His style and his sound were completely unique to him. He had a massive impact on guitar playing, and I don't there's anybody that's picked up the guitar since 1978 that hasn't been touched in some way by Eddie Van Halen's influence. I'm gonna miss his playing and I'm gonna miss him as a friend. Eddie Van Halen was amazing. Not since Jimi Hendrix had there been a guitar player that had so much impact and was so inspiring to me. He just explored the most simplest thing, a harmonic on a string, and brought it into this realm of technique that no one even thought was possible. He was just like from a different planet. TOM MORELLO: Eddie Van Halen was the Mozart of our generation. He had the kind of talent that maybe comes around once a century. Eddie Van Halen inspired me to practice 20,000 hours to try to get within 100 miles of his inspired mastery of the electric guitar. You know, if I hit 80, if I make it that far, I'll still be doing the same thing. I might not be jumping, I might be sitting on a stool, but I'll still be making music.

This is the real thing. (SCATTING) (CHEERING AND APPLAUSE) Listening to my father's records when I was four was the greatest early experience of my life. The music just seemed magical. And I wound up dedicating the rest of my life to finding those moments in music. Before I started Rolling Stones when I was 21 years old, I used to read a magazine called Crawdaddy! There was one writer in there, this Jon Landau, who could write about the music as if he understood musicians. BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN: One of my first recollections of Jon Landau was his trashing of The Blues Project in Crawdaddy!, which held the very first of rock criticism. And I was going like, who does this guy think he is? Who's Jon Landau? (LAUGHS) JANN WENNER: When I started Rolling Stone, I wrote him a letter, and he wrote me right back and said, "This sounds what I'd like to kinda do." We went out to a concert together and I sat next to Jon, just watched him. Seeing him tapping away on his legs and bouncing, playing drums, so full of excitement about the music. It was like it was going through him. From then on, Jon controlled music coverage. Writing about rock and roll in an intelligent and passionate way. As a critic he was measured, very thoughtful but he could take you down. (LAUGHS) WENNER: Jon Landau is very definitive in his pronouncements and sometimes, he gets it right, and sometimes, he gets it wrong. ♪ It's getting near dawn ♪ BROWNE: We'd run into people that he had savaged in print. Their eyes would narrow and say, "You're Jon Landau?" JON LANDAU: Look, I was born to be a critic. I got attention. It was some sort of success. But I was completely swept up in rock music. And then R&B. WENNER: At the beginning of Rolling Stone, Jon was writing extraordinarily penetrating analyses of things like Aretha Franklin, Otis Redding, Sam and Dave. LANDAU: My feeling was, well, the audience was all white, so I used my space to highlight great American Black music. But I really wanted to cross over from writing about the music to producing music. The first chance was the great MC5, and then with Livingston Taylor. Of course, then I met Bruce, and everything changed. Went to see him in this little club. Maybe 15 people there. It was just the greatest. Then, I saw him a second time. It was even better. Afterwards, I wrote an article that I'm still proud of to this day. MAN: Jon Landau said, "I saw rock and roll future and its name is Bruce Springsteen." BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN: First of all, when he said it, we didn't think it was going to turn into some iconic quote that people will still bring up forty years later, you know. He just saw a future in us. LANDAU: He was looking to do something different with his new album. He needed a collaborator. ♪ Hey! ♪ IOVINE: Before Born to Run came out, Bruce's records were always complicated. He hadn't really figured out the studio yet. I'd seen him on the stage, and it was astounding! It was so dynamic and so theatrical, but how do you focus this into two speakers? That was the challenge with Bruce. ♪ Down in Jungleland ♪ SPRINGSTEEN: Jon had the initial idea of doing something I had never even heard of. And it was something he called "editing". You mean, take something out? "No, no, no, no!" "We're the guys that put everything in! "I don't take anything out!" "Jungleland" needed space. Bruce wanted a very big, Spector-ish sound. And when you're playing a lot of notes, you can't get that sound. So Jon kept pushing, simplifying, give the space for breadth. And as they're doing this, the song is actually getting better. It was a fascinating moment. That epic song came to life. That editor is so important. That person on the receiving end of a manuscript. LANDAU: I don't know whether it was my prior experience being in writer/editor relationship with Rolling Stone, but my way of relating to artistic people just felt natural. SPRINGSTEEN: To this day, I think that's my favorite of Jon's production efforts, is the work we did together on Born to Run. BROWNE: I was really inspired by Born to Run. WENNER: The Pretender is much more a classic rock record than Jackson ever did. The piano, Spector sound. It's one of his best records. BROWNE: Jon made it a point to work with all the best musicians he could find in L.A. He'd be looking at the speakers and demanding this sound to become something he needed it to be. He would say, "You mind if I go talk to the piano player?" And he'd go out there for a few minutes and come back, and suddenly, these grand chords would be coming out. And that kind of tinkering with the mechanics of the music had a power that was undeniable. Working with him brought me to a complete other level of what I could do. ♪ Sail out of sight ♪ IOVINE: After Born to Run, we started Darkness. Pressure on that album was monumental. So they brought someone in to help me a little bit. But I was like, "Jon Landau, this can't happen!" He said, "Hey, Jim, stop!" "This is not about you." "This is about you helping Bruce make the best album he can." "It's called 'the big picture.'" That moment changed my life. ♪ Well if she wants to see me ♪ LANDAU: Whatever I do, I recognize who the other person is and what is gonna be helpful to them. BROWNE: Jon has a luminous knowledge. It's enabled he and Bruce to navigate waters that artists haven't done before. SPRINGSTEEN: There was an innate sort of intellectualism that was always part of the music we were working on. Thinking about what rock and roll meant, its place in society, its place in our own maturing. WENNER: Jon is a seminal figure in rock and roll. All of us are enormously grateful. Thank you, Jon. SPRINGSTEEN: As a writer, Jon was in the forefront. ♪ Let's go! ♪ As a producer, critical. And he created a management style based around not just the business, but nurturing the highest artistic goals, along with the personal growth. No one did that before Jon Landau and I don't think anyone's done it as well since. And he's always been an incredible friend. I welcome you, good friend, to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. To begin at the beginning, I love my Mom and Dad for gifting me with their humanity. But tonight I particularly want to thank them for taking me to a Pete Seger concert when I was four years old. Right then and there, while Pete was singing and playing his loud, shiny banjo, I suddenly felt my entire mini-consciousness exploding. And that's when I knew that I would spend my life in music. So, thanks to my childhood hero, Pete Seger. I thank my wife, Barbara, who I've loved for the last 43 years, our children, Kate and Charlie, and my brother David. I love you all. Thanks to my most dedicated and loyal partner, JLM, Barbara Carr, and George Travis. Allison Oscar, Jan Stapino, and my dear friend Chuck Plotkin. I love you all as well. Now I started writing about music in 1962 while a junior at Lexington High School. And from there, I met the late Paul Williams in 1966, who I thank so much for having published me in his pioneering Crawdaddy! magazine. And that in turn led to ten years of writing about music at Rolling Stone, where I earned my Ph.D. in life. So, love and thanks to my friend of a lifetime, Jann Wenner. On May 9th, 1974, I went to a concert at the Harvard Square Theater, and I was so overwhelmed by the performance that I went home after the show and wrote those famous words that I'm still so proud of. "I've seen rock and roll future, and its name is Bruce Springsteen." That night, I decided that I would somehow find a way to work with Bruce on his music and career. And so I did. For the next 45 years as his co-producer, manager, and most importantly, as a partner and friend who loves him deeply. So as I offer my thanks to the Hall of Fame for this extraordinary recognition, I also want to thank some of the other artists with whom I've worked, among them, Wayne Kramer, Rob Tyner, Fred "Sonic" Smith, and the extraordinary MC5. Livingston Taylor, my long-time friend Peter Wolf and the J. Geils Band. Natalie Merchant, Shania Twain, Train, and Alejandro Escovedo. I offer my special thanks and love to the extraordinary Jackson Browne, whose faith in me back in 1976 gave me the confidence to reach for the sky. And of course, I reserve my most heartfelt thanks for Bruce, who gave me the chance, the encouragement, and the love that I needed to fully realize who I am and what I have to contribute. And without whom this moment could never have happened. RINGO STARR: From T. Rex, my good friend, Marc Bolan. People knew him as a great musician, a songwriter, a guitarist, but he was also a poet, and he was very proud of that. He was always telling me that. He was the number-one selling poet in Britain. In fact, his poetry was as important to him as his music. He had great style and was really unlike anyone else I have ever met. He was a great performer, just incredible. And that's why I call the film we did together Born to Boogie, because he really was. I told Marc, "I'll bring the camera and everything else." "You just bring yourself." We had a lotta fun together. I remember lots of laughter. We lost him way too young, but in his short life, he made over 12 albums that are as far-out and ahead of their time as he was. With the help of Tony Visconti and his band T. Rex, Marc's style started a lot of trends. They called it "glam rock," with singles such as "Get It On", "Children of the Revolution", and of course, "Born to Boogie". But it was always just great music to me. And that's why people are still listening to T. Rex today. There's no doubt they belong in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, finally! And I'm very proud to welcome them in right now. Peace and love to Marc, Mickey, Steve, and Bill. And peace and love to all the fans, from me and T. Rex. Peace and love. Some people like to rock! Some people like to roll.

I really think my dad was put on this earth not only to play music but to show off his unique magnetism and charisma. He took inspiration from American music, but formulated his own persona and his own sound. The T. Rex sound kept evolving up to when my mother joined the group, creating a cosmic soul which still tests musical boundaries as well as racial ones. As I reflect on this incredible honor of my dad and his band being inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, I think about how I really didn't have a chance to know him very well. He was taken away from all of us so early in his life. I discovered his music pretty much the same way you have, through my eyes and ears. When I was a kid watching MTV, Def Leppard's "Rocket" video came on, and it had clips of T. Rex's performance of "Get It On". That was my daily "hello" to my father. When I saw GNR, and Slash was wearing his Slider t-shirt and looking just like my dad, I had to check out the Slider album and discover the T. Rex sound for myself. I know my dad would be very proud to receive this. He always aimed for the top, and here he is now. To my mother, Gloria Jones, my uncle, Harry Feld, friends and fans all across the world, keep a little Marc in your heart and long live T. Rex.

You want to leave a legacy like this. You can feel these vibrations of what happened and why it happened. These musicians definitely feel more real to me when I see their guitars or see the clothes that they've worn. These artists have gotten their blood, sweat and tears on these instruments, while creating the music that I listen to. There's not a feeling like it. CONNOR PETERSON: When I look around at all the stuff here, I see these instruments that are just so beaten and worn down. And it's because all these artists put so much time and effort and fervor into their performances. There's a piece of them in that instrument. JERI LEE SAPRONETTI: This place really is just this mecca. This place I'm so fortunate to have in my backyard. I can just come here and look at, you know, John Lennon's guitar. Like, right up close. It's like, dude, he played this on The Ed Sullivan Show! That single day changed music history. I get this feeling, like, they're here. It's so trippy. COE: The guitar that Jimi Hendrix was holding decades before I was even born, that's the closest I'm ever gonna get, is a little piece of him inside that instrument. This drum kit is from the man. Keith Moon. You can't but get inspired and say, "Hey, I want to do that!" Breaking guitars and blowing up kick drums and just-- It's just great. Oh, they were real! Oh, it happened! Seeing their songs on paper is inspiring. They made magic when they made music. I feel like I'm right next to it. It was almost like going to an art museum. To be able to keep the legacy of these great artists alive so that younger generations can come in and say, "Wow!" PETERSON: There's always that hope in the back of your mind as a musician that, like, "Maybe mine might end up in here one day." ELIZABETH KELLY: Sometimes I think about if somebody is gonna go through my notebooks as I'm, like, furiously crossing things out. "Is this gonna end up in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame?" Yeah, they gonna be hanging this dang motherfucker right here! Yeah. With that one right there. Got a couple of hats that they can put in there too. And shoes. That's why I'm here, 'cause I'm supposed to be here! ALICIA KEYS: Whitney Houston is one of one. There is no one like her and there never will be. I remember growing up, listening to her music, and dancing around the house and jumping on my bed, singing her songs into my hairbrush. This golden voice with range and runs and power, like none, with a face and a presence like royalty She was every little girl's admiration. When I first met her, she sought me out at one of Clive Davis' pre-Grammy parties. I was still in awe of this crazy world I was newly welcomed into. And she marched right up to me and she said, "You... are gonna write a song for me." (LAUGHS) I couldn't believe it! Had the greatest voice of all time just demanded that of little old me? I was shocked and completely overjoyed and slightly scared. And thus began a beautiful friendship that was so genuine and sincere. We were kindred spirits and instant sisters. We did work together on "Million Dollar Bill," a song I wrote for her album I Look to You. We laughed so much that I thought we'd never be able to finish the song. We called each other Mema. And I cherish every moment that I got to talk to her, be in her beautiful company, and love her. I still can't believe that was Whitney's last album and that she's no longer with us. We all know what a miraculous singer Whitney was. Perhaps the greatest voice of our time. We all know how her unprecedented success brought Black women into the absolute highest reaches of the music industry's pantheon. We all know that her music will live forever. That music, that everlasting voice, is her final, generous gift to us. And she will now be one of the brightest lights ever to shine in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. Congratulations, Mema.

So one day Kevin came to me and he said, "Whitney, I got this song called I Will Always Love You". Dolly Parton wrote it. It's a country and western song, but I think you're gonna love it."

She worked hard at it, too. This is something that Whitney always wanted.

(LAUGHS) Yeah. She did it. PAT HOUSTON: This moment right now proves it all, that there's only one matchless Whitney Houston, and tonight, she would be very proud and honored to receive this award. I'm proud of who she was. I'm proud that she took it in and did what she was supposed to do. What can I say now? If I talk too long, I'll cry. I don't want to cry. (LAUGHS) So thank you.
