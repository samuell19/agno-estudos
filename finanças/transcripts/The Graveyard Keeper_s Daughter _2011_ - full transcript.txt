Eight, nine, eleven, twelve, fourteen, fifteen... Seventeen, nineteen, twenty. Here I come! Frank! You peeked! Did not! Your head was showing. You are "it". Eedi's got a son, they say. Sure he has. Had, at least. He was a young boy when he left. Perhaps he doesn't know it's his father. He surely didn't buy a coffin. Had he stayed with Eedi, he would've been just another boozer now. Just one more drunk. Where are they hiding? What do you think? Why did you rat us out? And drink faster. I need two more bottles. A film by Katrin Laur THE GRAVEYARD KEEPER'S DAUGHTER Stupid! Lucia! Now what happened? Kaido is going to buy me a skateboard, as well. Get up! Why are you rushing like that? Were you hurt? Look at you, how dirty you are. Come let's go to the classroom. Does it hurt anywhere? No. Into the classroom, all of you. Are all the workbooks on the table? Today we talk... Teacher, I don't have a workbook. Dear me. Take Ants's workbook from the shelf. It seems you haven't had your human studies workbook all year. You probably don't even have it any more...? Today's topic is what we do on Sundays. You, too, Saara and Jasmiin. Girls, turn and start working. The topic today is what we do at home on Sundays? The first question is what time do you wake up on Sunday? Anto, please. Eight o'clock. Full sentence, please. I wake up at eight o'clock on Sunday morning. Don't you sleep longer on Sundays? No! I need to help my father feed the heifers. Good boy. I wake up at two o'clock. No, at five o'clock. You learned time already in kindergarten. Is five o'clock in the morning? - I get up in the evening. She is having a hangover from Saturday. Rein, what nonsense was it now? Bring your diary here! Sit down and start working. Everyone will ask their partner a serious question and answer the partner's question. Teacher, I need to go to the loo. Volli promised to give us his old SUV, with it we are going to a demolition derby in August. They won't take me, I'm a child. You're already a big man. Girlfriend and everything... Cool sound, right? See, I let you drive by yourself. Do you dare? Sure Very good. You drive very well. Much better than I did. I was squirming a lot. Your house is on fire. Fucking hell. Maria? Maria. I'm going to tell mother everything! I'm going to tell mother! How nice that we now get a real music teacher. We used to have a choir earlier, even two choirs. Surely. I've got a question to teacher Purga about a pupil. Luu-cee-yah Rist. - Yes-yes, Lucia. She's got really poor marks. How did she manage in the first grade? It was better in the first grade. Have you talked to the parents about leaving her behind? She can't be moved up to the third grade... This home is of no help. Last year her mother worked at the shop. Things were better then. Since she got fired, she took to drinking. A party every Lord's day. And the father? - He is a graveyard keeper. But the graveyard here is small and people get buried rarely. Or constructions jobs, when he can find some. He isn't much of a man to say anything to Maria. Many people have lost their jobs, those people drink. I don't understand where do they get money for it? And there's not much left for children. It's like the one in our graveyard. The angel? An angel is God's messenger. Anyway, if it has wings it can fly. I haven't had time to go shopping. Have you got anything to eat at home? Give us money, we'll go to the shop. That's all I've got. Take us also to Tartu. - Some other time. Good bye! Good bye. What are these? What are these, I ask you! Get out of here. Get out of here now and fast! I'm going to tell everything to your father. The acorn doesn't fall far from the oak. The artist lady has given her retard to you to feed? He doesn't give you any money for smokes? He hasn't got much himself. Now he's working in Albu, brings home when can. Listen, borrow me money for smokes. Money, to you? See you! See you. Well, hi! Hi! Are you a thief, or what? Shop-Liivi yelled across the entire shop upon seeing me. Stuffed two Mars' bars into her pocket! Wait, who's a bigger thief, Lucia or Shop-Liivi? Fuck, it doesn't matter. But here's what I say, and that's a sure thing, you mustn't steal. I say. Mom didn't steal from the shop, Liivi just blames your mother for her own shortage. Promise you won't steal any more? Right, woman. Where are the shot glasses? Well, girls... We're going to Finland. On the plane! Dummy! Who'd take a plane to Finland! By ship, of course! Skol! Like for good? - Who knows? At first, no. In a word, some Finnish graveyard keepers invited us, Estonian graveyard keepers, or those from L채채ne county, I don't know that specifically, and our families to visit. They're paying for the whole trip and a week's stay. See, there you have your vacation and a trip abroad. We still need money to buy something. I'll earn some next week and everything will be alright, if only you won't drink it all. Girlie, yes! We're going to Finland. May I also try? Wait, stop. Stop it. Come back. My new bike. Teacher! Lucia. Where did you get the bicycle from? Kaido bought me. - Don't you lie. He hasn't bought it yet, but I want to show him which one I want. - Listen, when you go home, tell your father and mother to come to school. Don't forget, your dad and mom to school! The pink bike is simply super. Dad will buy me a scooter, if I help him feed the heifers. I'm going to a demolition derby with Kaido. He hasn't got such a powerful car. Let's go, let's go. Next! - It's my turn, damn it. Oh, shut up, you sod. Anne, shut it. Didn't have trousers on... - Let her sing. I win. Whose is this? Mine. Very good, it's ours. Ours, ours! The crow sat on a fence, asking a hare for a kiss. Beat it, you popeye, I don't feel like it. Ding! Hey, you're alright. You're also vulgar. Let's go, let's go. We like laughter Yes, we like love. Hello! - Hello. Go with this one. I'm looking for Lucia's parents. Kaido is working on a construction in Albu. We can talk when he's back. In a week. - He'll be back next week. You can come then. You're the mother? You're the mother? Yes! Yeah. So what's up? Could we talk outside for a moment? Outside? Can't you talk here? - I don't understand. We're all close friends here. Everything is under control. Easy. Give her a smoke. - Here you go. Maria. Remember Maria... And who are you? - I'm the new teacher, Mets. Lucia has very poor grades. Did you know it? Yes I did. But what do I have to do then? Let's discuss it tomorrow in the social department, I have an appointment at eleven o'clock. Let's meet at ten at the bus stop. Jasmiin. Good girl. You've studied well. I don't have to worry about you. And now Lucia... First, here's a certificate for winning the county sports day. You are good in sports. But your studies weren't as good this year. We'll see what we can do with you in fall. I won't come to this school any more. We're going to Finland. Who'll let you aboard of a ship with such dirty feet? Children, why are you so? Is anybody home? Is anybody home? Good morning. Where is your mother? How should I know? Isn't she home? I looked from the doorway, I didn't see anyone. Then she isn't there. What do you want from her? We wanted to take a bus to Haapsalu in the morning. Perhaps she left earlier? Then you and I are going to Haapsalu. Jats will come, as well. No, no. We are going to the social department. Jats will come along. Hasn't she got anyone else to stay with? Have you got anyone? A man or a child or a boyfriend? Children don't ask such things from grown-ups. And teachers are to be addressed respectfully. So you're the new teacher. Say, has the child protection worker met your parents yet? Which children does she protect? Such who need protection. If necessary, then you. Let me comb. - I protect me myself. We'll find you a school where it's easier for you. You want to put me into the school for the stupid kids? It's a school for the kids with special needs. I don't have any special needs. We're hungry. - We're already late. What sort of child protection is that? Excuse me. Hello. I'm looking for Mrs. Tuvike, the child protection worker. This is me. - Hello, I'm teacher Mets, I called you two days ago about a child. But we didn't agree that you come with them. Children, let's go and wait in this room. Please, wait for us there. I don't know about this other child, but Lucia Rist has to go to Niitv채Ija School. She has nothing to do in a regular school. It's dangerous, to let a child live under such conditions. First I have to meet the parents. If they won't come, I'll go there myself. And if Niitv채Ija school seems necessary, she'll get there. Jats! I see. Good bye. What a girl. Kaido! Jats. Kaido. Hey, what are you doing here? - We're playing. Where's your mother? We're leaving for Finland tomorrow. Should we buy one for Maria? I'll buy these for myself. - Take a pair for Maria, also. Maybe you'll find work in Finland? Who knows, maybe I will. It has been set that time doesn't stop, but flies by. Ciao, Maria! And Kaido. It's Robert's birthday today. Let's go! We're leaving on a trip early in the morning. I'll bring you back myself, just a few clicks away. I don't even know this Robert. - Come on! What are you moaning there, it's a party! I've seen this man once before in my life. I'll only drink to his health and be right back. No hurt feelings, okay? They check if your feet are clean before letting you aboard. One man and a child when it was written: "with families". Stop. Stop, stop! Kaido! Take the leg away... I told you I'll bring her back myself. Kaido, see, we brought your wife back! Lucy, hi there! Look, mommy's here. Aye, Kaido. Kaido, don't be angry. Mommy is here. Finland, Finland, Finland. I like laughter! Me too. Pats, come to Finland. Have a nice trip. Everything is alright! Let's follow them. This Jorma, who invited you, he isn't here. The graveyard keeper we were supposed to stay with had to go to Lapland. And he will not come back. So this job is available? - Yes, it is. Welcome. Sirpa Laakso. Kaido. Maria. Lucia. Sirpa. I'm a pastor here. I speak a bit Estonian and Russian. I, too, speak Russian. - Good. Yes, Jorma went away. If you want you can live in my house. Oh, thanks. Lucia. I don't want to eat. Welcome. To our acquaintance. Where do you have a telly? We all want to eat dinner together now. If you don't want to eat, I'll take you to bed. You think that I go to bed at nine o'clock or what? Or that I haven't seen boozing before? Lucia! March off to bed! So will you ask her about the job? You have to find a proper moment for that. You're like Pippi Longstocking, who didn't want to go to sleep. Have you read the Pippi book? You can't imagine what kind of life I'm leading. I, too, went to school, studied in an Estonian school, but my name is Ivanova. Masha Ivanova, a Russian broad. When I met Kaido I said: I'll take your name. Now I'm Maria Rist. Maria Cross. Fucking cross... My life's all fucked up. I've got nothing. But Masha, you've got a child. Good morning. Who else lives here? You mean in my home? Nobody does. A husband, or a child, or a father, mother? I've got father and mother, they live in Helsinki. But no husband, nor a child. You're also old. But who the food is for? - For myself. And now for you. You do like to feed strangers. You're no longer that much of a stranger to me. Let's make some omelette, your father and mother want to eat, as well. Then Jesus told this parable: "A man had a fig tree, planted in his vineyard, and he went to look for fruit on it, but did not find any. So he said to the man who took care of the vineyard, 'For three years now I've been coming to look for fruit on this fig tree and haven't found any. Cut it down! Why should it use up the soil?' " 'Sir,' the man replied, 'leave it alone for one more year, and I'll dig around it and fertilize it. If it bears fruit next year, fine! If not, then cut it down. "' Yet our belief is weak. What is it? Oh, this? This is Maria. As is my mother. And Jesus's. Silly people crucified her son. - And he died? He died. And was resurrected. After that nobody has to fear death. Do you believe it yourself what you talk about? How can a normal person become a pastor? My father was a pastor. I, too, wanted to help people. My father was a drunk and that is why I don't stand your god. Because he doesn't give a shit. He pities nobody. Take Jats, for example. She is a complete idiot, can't even keep his mouth shut. All she wants to do is eat. What wrong has she done? Jats is god's messenger. - A what? Angel! She said it for herself. - Jats can't speak. Yes, she can a little. She looks like our angel. So perhaps Jats can fly, as well? That's the least of things angels do. What else do they do? - Angels watch over us and protect us. There's an angel behind every person. Then Jats is the one standing behind me. This is Turku castle. We've got one like this in Haapsalu, only bigger. You don't believe? I'll show when you come to visit us. Teacher Purga also found herself a man at old age, perhaps you'll, too, find someone. I don't feel like wanting it that much any more, but a girl like you I could have. Like Pippi Longstocking. Dear Lord. She has to vomit, or she'll have alcohol intoxication. Haven't you thought that Maria should go to rehab? It costs money. Take Kaido as the graveyard keeper. But Kaido lives in Estonia. Yeah, but we come to Finland. Right, Maria? There's high unemployment also in Finland. Kaido, see you. I'll come visit you in Estonia. Good bye! - Thanks - You're welcome. Say hi to Jatsi and the angel for me. Jats! Sweetie. See I did not stay in Finland. Please be seated! What are you doing? - Praying, of course. Dear Lord, bless this food and drink Prosit! The first dish is lamb chops Chinese style. There's no watching of TV during a meal. Better not at all. Hello. Hello. You're finally back. Great. I've been looking for you the whole week. Here and at home and at the graveyard. Who are you looking for? You. You're Kaido? Yes. Lucia's father? - Yes, I am. But who are you? I'm teacher Mets, I'm Lucia's class teacher from next year. We'd agreed with Lucia's mother to go to the social department. But she wasn't at home, so I went with Lucia and... that girl with a syndrome. Then Lucia ran away and I've been looking for her the whole week long. Yes, I picked them up near the shop. Right, I thought she would find her way home. Something has to change. I guess so. Please, come with me to Haapsalu, we have to talk to the child protection worker. That's women's business. - You're Lucia's father? Well, I am. There's no work here. All I earn I bring home. I'm not talking about work, but about raising a child. What kind of an educator am I? Especially for a girl? Lucia's mother has an alcohol problem. What about you? Around here everybody drinks, with very few exceptions. Will you agree to send Lucia to a foster family? You are incapable of raising a child. Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Anyhow, it's you who decides it or the school or what have you? Why, why didn't you tell me? They put her into the orphanage. What do you want? - What do I want? I want to know why you didn't tell me. Now it's too late. Stop breaking things. Fuck you! Fuck yourself! Find someone else to raise your child. Let them, for fuck's sake, put her to an orphanage. You fucking loser! Fuck! Sure, I'm a loser when I live with the like of you. You, sod, brought me here to the countryside to die. I could have had in Tallinn every man I only wanted. I was young and beautiful girl. You brought me here to die. I don't even have a proper coffin. You're won't die. Lucia! Lucia! I went to Finland. Looking for a job. Kaido. What'll become of us now? To have you put in an orphanage and for me to hang myself? I don't want to go to an orphanage. I will never put you in an orphanage. I'm not the first woman to bring up a child alone. Do you want me to make omelette? We don't have any eggs. I'll go and buy some. - We don't have money. I'll take empty bottles to the shop. Look, Kaido's phone. Where did you find it? - Underneath the table. Hi there. I'm a child protection worker Tuvike from the local government. So now you... come to take Lucia to the orphanage? Who told you such a thing? It doesn't matter who did. What do you want? - I want to help you. We need money. If you come to the Social Department in Haapsalu, we can see how we can help you financially. But you have to come in any case, teacher Mets is really angry with you. So you're the one digging graves from now on? Isn't Kaido coming back any more? He is. As long as he's in Finland, I'll be here. Bloody Estonian men. Some are in Finland, some in Ireland, some trek with bicycles in Tibet. That's how we die off. Learn the trade, hop in. Meanwhile give me a smoke. What are you doing down there? Can't you see? -I do, but I don't believe my eyes. Is he now forcing you to dig graves in his place? I'll try again some other time, but... don't give Kaido's job to anyone, right? He'll be back, I say. He'll work some time, earn money and then come back. Damn it, here's no work at all, is there? I'd never take back a pig like that. You said he left his mobile here? He did. And you're complaining you've got no money. Why the hell SMS-loans exist? No, no don't you do that... I saw how Elmar's son took one. We wanted to drink vodka, bud didn't have any money. We were all watching, craning our necks. What are you worried about, it's from Kaido's mobile phone. Wait. I'm not sure. What do I say when they ask? The man is gone and the mobile as well? Don't you tell that. - It's exactly what you'll say. Maria. We need to go to Haapsalu. Mom's head is hurting. I'll be right there, in a minute. Wait here. Where's Tuvike? - Went to Tallinn. Why did she go there? - I don't know. You were supposed to come early in the morning. But when will she be back? - Tomorrow. Tell her, we'll come tomorrow. Let's go. Yes! What is it? There is money. Look, it'll come out. What are we going to do with it? We'll buy you a bicycle! Jats, let's go home. In the attic, you can hardly hear any noise. Jats, let's go to sleep. ...my Pa went to pick raspberries. When you sing aa-ah, aa-ah, you'll fall asleep... Purr, purr, purr, purr... the little baby bear cries. Lucia! Maria! Jats! Now I stand behind you. Lucia! Get up and get dressed. See, I brought you new clothes. Be a good child, get dressed. Where are you taking me? - To a foster home. To an orphanage? Sort of. Where's Maria? Your mother can't come right now. Then she still gave me to an orphanage. A criminal matter has been initiated against you. Six-year-old Jacinta Kerge was killed in the fire and municipal property was destroyed. While the investigation is in progress you are not allowed to leave Ridala rural municipality. Where's Lucia? Your daughter is in a foster home. Where is it? - That I can't tell you. The child protection worker has initiated a process to revoke your parental rights. MUNICIPAL LODGING Good evening. Could I sleep the night over here? We're open until ten o'clock. I didn't know that. - You've been drinking. No, I haven't. Go away. I haven't been drinking... Not since the fire, do you hear me? What are you blustering? Leave, or I'll call the police. Go away! Take this to Maria. That's all I can do for now. That's all I have. Half a year's wages would be something. Money, money, money. If they find new parents for Lucia, are you then going to buy yourself a new daughter? You're afraid. Yes, I am. I'm afraid that I'm a loser and always will be. What good does a father like that do Lucia? Tell Lucia when I come back, I'll buy her a bike. It is my fault. - But not Lucia's fault. They put her into an orphanage. They told me it's a foster home, but in fact it's an orphanage. But don't you think maybe she'd be better off there? We took the matter to court to have your parental rights revoked. Your husband was not against it. I will not give Lucia to an orphanage. You won't! I, too, hoped that you can pull yourself together and the result: one child is dead and the other escaped by the skin of it's teeth. I quit drinking. I hear that every day. Do you have a clue what effort it takes to live a normal life? All the people from whom we take their children away, they don't even know how to lead a normal life. They've never seen normal people living normal lives. Earlier, there were kolkhozes and work, people drank vodka at work, didn't have to put on clean clothes any more. Kolkhozes disappeared, but the people stayed the same. Do you know a single family living like normal people? I am coming from the town. I know. You went to high school, even finished it. But I don't know why it didn't help you. I'm still alive. I'm not dead. I can learn. I promised Lucia that I won't give her to the orphanage. And that I stand behind her. Like a guardian angel, like Jats. Now that Jats is no longer. Just wait a bit, Pippi hollered. Is she bald? Surely not, the girl angrily replied. Good for her, Pippi stated and spat out the heart of the princess. The girl went on, but then Pippi shouted. I brought you the book of Pippi Longstocking, but you already have one. Maria put me in the orphanage. No, she didn't. It's that Maria is sick and sick people can't raise children. What sickness does she have? Alcohol sickness, you know, drinking. Is that a sickness? - A serious sickness. Can you get well? You can, if you really want to. Maria goes to a hospital to cure it. You can come and live with me. For keeps? For keeps, or until Maria gets well, finds a job and a flat. I think I'll wait for my mother. And maybe for father, too. Come, sleep, and cover my eyes with your hands so I can get rest. Tomorrow, I will be better than yesterday. Tomorrow, I will be better than today.
