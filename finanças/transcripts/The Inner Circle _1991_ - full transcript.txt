BASED ON REAL FACTS Each morning as I rode the streetcar to work I watched them put together the great steel figures. The Second World War had broken out in Europe. Our capitalist enemies were killing each other. And as I looked at these statues, I imagined that our Master had ordered them built to show the invincibility of our socialist motherland. The man we called " Master " was one of the heroes who created our Workers' State. He was more than our ruler. He was Father to all of us! - Every factory worker and every peasant woman. His name was Joseph Stalin. Which in Russian, meant "Man of Steel". Moscow - 1939 Increase volunteers to help the Red Army The Soviets are ready to contribute to the defense of our Great Motherland. The workers of culture and science request that iintelligentsia launch all their force and energy to master modern chemical defense! No Soviet man must be without his own gas mask. This is the slogan of our time. Not a single day without a gas mask! This is what the progressive workers of plant #23 call for! And this slogan is picked up by the masses. Today, you can spot a gas mask in the street and in the library, on a ballet stage and in the ambulance The modern Soviet gas mask is easy to handle and efficient in use. For the first time in the world, Professor Petrov performed an operation with a gas mask on his face. In the Kremlin, the best volunteers demonstrated their mastership to the Minister of Defense, comrade Voroshilov. It took them only 3 1/2 seconds to be in complete-- I was a film projectionist for the KGB. I had the best corner of the room in an apartment on Slaughterhouse St. and I was about to marry the most beautiful girl I had ever known. To your wedding! 30,000 sportsmen demonstrated their physical fitness at the Red Square to Stalin The best friend to Soviet athletes. The 'Day of an athlete', favorite holiday of the Soviet People is a celebration of youth and health. Comrade Stalin and his brother in arms, comrade Voroshilov... take pride in the growth of the young generation. Now, to my bride! The folk music of all Soviet Republic builders does not cease all day at the Red Square. Triumphant fanfares and colorful dances... flowers and smiles, courage and strength. This is the motto of the Soviet youth At any time, ready to stand for the defense of the Soviet motherland. The Red Army is replenished with athletes excellent in physical fitness.

How can you not be excited seeing all these people?? You'll get used to it. What's that you are poking into the projector? Toothbrush Very convenient for cleaning. I always carry one with me. The old projectionist never had anything like that! What happened to him? He died. The night you came, the Minister of Cinema yelled at him So he had a heart attack! Ended up dead! What are they doing with that vacuum cleaner? Testing the air. The air? In case someone wants to poison him... But... Who? There are spies and subversives everywhere. Even here ... in the Kremlin?

Deputy Chief of Special Sector Colonel Schelkasov Sperial Sector? What's that? You'll find out soon enough! Is everything is in order? Yes, Comrade General. You missed it, **** I didn't have time to check it all, Comrade General. You didn't have time... Petrov! Take it for testing now I'll take care of it.. General Vlasik is not a dumb * !

The minute I call you, start looking, all right? Svetlana, come here, my dear girl. There they were. The Heroes of our revolution. Just like ordinary people going to a movie. Kalinin - The President Molotov - The Foreign Minister Kaganovich, even Comrade Beria The head of the KGB - who everyone, even the other men in that room, were so afrad of. And then... Comrade Stalin! Comrade... Stalin! Where is Comrade Voroshilov? -Sanshin! -Put on The Great Waltz! The Great Waltz! So they started... Yes, comrade Voroshilov. What's on?

Comrade Stalin, this is our new projectionist, Ivan Sanshin. Where is the old one? He got sick. Tuberculosis... Is this one healthy? This one is healthy. You projected well, comrade Sanshin Listen, Joseph... You know you asked me to look into the reorganization of the Bug off! Join us! Don't be shy. Dig in. Is it ok? Yes, it's ok. Come on, shovel it in. Once it's opened, it might be eaten. They'll never use it again! You've eaten all the brandy-filled chocolates..! She likes the brandy chocolates, huh? How does it feel sitting in the Master's chair? It's still warm, right? The Master was very angry with the Minister of Defense! What does he have against Voroshilov? The Japanese crushed us... ... in Manchuria. He won't forgive him for that. Comrades Officers! Who is that for? For my wife. When they make you the Head of Special Sector you can treat your wife to candies! You can stuff yourself with them. ..but take them out? Never! I Got it. The Soviet people unanimously declare ... there is no limit to our indignation! We demand the right sentence for the gang of traitors to socialism. Throughout the country, people rallied in support of the purge after Comrade Beria discovered another counter-revolutionary plot against the Master. I can remember the huge demonstrations at Red Square. All of us chanting: "Death to the traitors". 50,000 high-ranking party members confessed to being capitalist agents. All of them were either imprisoned, or executed. I love watching feet... even cows' feet! Just like in the village, isn't it? "Mercenaries and saboteurs have been condemned" "by the Military Court of the USSR today, to the firing squad!" Why do you take down Voroshilov's picture? You don't like him anymore? Maybe he's an enemy of the people as well, huh.. What? What did you say? I was just joking! Who told you this? Nobody told me! Who have you been talking to? Nastia, tell me.. Who have you been talking to? -I haven't been talking to anyone! -It was Morda, wasn't it! No, I haven't been talking to Morda. It was a joke! Don't you know what can happen when you make these kinds of jokes??! Don't YOU??!!? You stupid country fool! You deserve a good beating for this joke!! You stupid little- Hey! Hey! Get out of there! Get out! Get out! Orphanage Center KGB I'm applying for the job to help with the children. Go ahead. Thank you. You'll register with the Staff Department, tomorrow. Now straight to the showers! We need all the hands we can get. The kids must be sent out! and they haven't been washed in three days!! And all of them are still in shock!! and most of them don't even understand that their parents were arrested... for being traitors to the motherland! Who dressed you so smart? I did... What a good girl you are. What's your name? I want my mommy.. Come, let's go play with the kids! I'm Marsha! - Now Peter, come and hold her hand! -I'm not Peter. I'm Volva! Children! Join hands and form a circle! Come quickly! Join hands and form a circle! Come quickly! Now children, I want-- Please meet a special boy! His name is Pavlik. Like that of Pavlik Morozov! He's a hero! And do you know why? His mother and father turned out to be enemies of the people, and he denounced them! So let's dance around our hero! 1,2,3! Our country is a land of beauty, Our country is a land that's free... Many are bloodhounds in their cities All these kids must be sent to Pokrov in two hours! The home there is large enough for all of them. Have you got kids? Are you looking for someone? No! Just looking.. Have you been to Pokrov? It's a big orphanage there.. nice and clean, with good food too. I want my mommy! Did you meet a little girl by the name of Katya? She has a red bow in her hair. -No? So little, but stubborn! probably took after her parents! Do not be afraid! You'll get your things back! Prick her with something! Here use this pin! Have you seen this nice girl called Katya? She has a red bow? Aunt Anastasia! Katya! I can not believe I found you! Look at you! We'll wash you, and dry you and I'll ask nice lady if we can take you home. I was right! Please forgive me comrade Agorzova! I lied. I came here to see the girl! I knew it! I sensed it. Is she your relative? No, she's one of my neighbors, the Gubelmans. She's little Gubelman! I recognized her straight away! Katya Gubelman! Tania! No! -Finish what she has done! -You can not take Katya from me! You're coming with me! It's not enough that you are taking your own, you idiot! you want to put me in with you !? I could end up in a labor camp because of you! The child cannot be responsible for her parents.. Comrade Stalin said... Comrade Stalin said, but Comrade Beria ordered! Got it?! The KGB has already a file on her, do you understand!!? She's MFTM! Member of the Family of the Traitors of the Motherland. All these kids without exception are... loaded in... In where? Into the meat grinder. Can I just say goodbye to her? No, you can't! I won't let you torture the poor child! Think of her, every time her little heart breaks into pieces! Get out of here! Pokrov... it's the town south of Moscow, no? Yes. Thank you very much Comrade Agorzova! Hey! Whatever happens, remember... I don't know your name. I haven't seen your passport. So don't hold anything against me.. It is the second time it's broken! This Soviet portable projector is a new model. The projectionist hasn't mastered it yet. It's not that, comrade minister. I know this machine! How can you? It is the latest design. This comrade Minister is an exact copy of the German Bauer the 1925 model I worked with one just like it in the army. A copy of what? Of the Bauer, Comrade Stalin! German. Except that the German model has a steel spring that holds the frame of this... spring is made of... I don't know what... help tighten the claw tears the film Show me the spring. It is not even a spring, it's a little wire! We have a whole Minister of Cinema but we have no little spring! We can't even copy the Germans properly! Comrade Boreshilkov, you promised we'd have a patent on portable projectors of Soviet design. And it turns out just to be a copy! And a bad one at that! We will correct our mistake, Comrade Stalin! Isn't it a little late? You should be ashamed. And look! We are sitting here watching films in comfort, drinking mineral water, eating fruit, but in a remote corner of Siberia, where winter lasts eight months, a simple man, a farmer wonders what he can do. He could have seen a movie of the Red Square parade or a comedy to relax, But there is no movie for him. Why? Because Comrade Bolshakov failed in his duty. And didn't provide a proper little spring. We may not have enough of everything but as for steel... we have plenty! Am I right, Comrade Kaganovich? We are up to here in steel, Comrade Stalin! Comrade-- Sanshin, Comrade Sanshin. Comrade Sanshin, Can you repair it? I'll try my best, comrade Stalin! Then we will have a tea break. Oh, have tea with lemon! Look Sanshin.. don't be nervous. Don't worry, Comrade Minister! Comrade Kalinin? Kalinin, join us! Don't nap on the job, old man! I'm ready, Comrade Stalin! And Comrade Bolshakov thinks you're too inexperienced! We haven't even had time to drink our tea... and you've already fixed the problem. Then have some tea with us, Comrade Sanshin! No thank you, comrade Stalin.. Good tea is like a kiss from a beautiful woman... strong and sweet! Why are your hands shaking? Did you raid a henhouse? No. I didn't raid a henhouse, Comrade Stalin. My hands are shaking because it's the first time that I've seen you this close! So what? It's the first time I have seen you this close but my hands aren't shaking! In your opinion, comrade Sanshin Is this projector any better than the German original? It's a good projector, Comrade Stalin! Very good. But the spring should be improved, eh? Don't worry! We're all friends here! It would be better if it were made of steel. Bolshakov! Did you hear that? Follow the recommendations of this expert. December 21, 1940 The Master's Birthday The capitalist countries were destroying each other. Poland and France had fallen. But we were safe. Comrade Stalin had signed a nonaggression pact with Hitler. Our nation was at peace and my life was perfect. I had been taken into the "Inner Circle". Great news, comrades! We're moving to the Gubelmans' room! It's your lucky day, Fedosia! Now you can live by yourself, just like before the revolution! I'm sure they will send some asshole in your place. "Do not open" So, you like it? Yes, I like it very much. Except for that on the wall. Here.. We can get new wallpaper in the spring. And for now, we put something in front of it. Ivan, do you have permission to move? Do you want to know who gave us this room? Yeah, I think it's time you knew, but Only You. You must keep it a secret. Not one word - not to anyone, never! Nastia! I work with Comrade Stalin! No! Where? In the Kremlin! With Comrade Stalin! It's been five months already now! He loves movies, so I show him movies. Both in the Kremlin and at his country residence! And for his kids too! When I don't come home at night It's because I'm there! At their house. You see, Anastasia? Your husband is an officer of the KGB! The uniform is made to order but I can only wear it on special occasions. Otherwise, simple civilian clothes. My God! A spring mattress! And it doesn't creak! Come here, Nastia! My God! We're so lucky! To be honored like this! There's only a handful of us that can see Him that close! I saw him already like this. Face to face! Twice! Do you think he's kind? There's probably no one kinder in the whole world!! Let's write him a letter about Katya. Katya, What Katya? Gubelman. Ah, there you go again with Gubelmans... Don't you understand? They're enemies of the people! Ivan? I'm dying to have a child.. Nothing's happening with us. It was that old witch behind the wardrobe.. Made me shy. Now it will be different! I'll just write the letter. and you can give it to him when you have time! It is forbidden to pass letters to him! And he really shouldn't be disturbed. If you had any idea how much he has to worry about. There are enemies everywhere... Internal, external, imperialists, fascists, Japanese... Totkistas, all lurking about! And I'm going to bother him about a daughter of an enemy of the people!? If it weren't for these Gubelman types... We would have had communism long ago. Let go of me! With an asshole like you for a husband, I am doomed to this hellhole till I die Orphanage. 23 Pokrov Aunt Anastasia! Aunt Anastasia! Katya! I want to show you something! Here! Over here. You've grown since Easter, but there's nothing left of you! Do you recognize my bow? Vera tryed to steal it twice! She had to clean corridors.. after lunch as punishment! Just wait till you go to school. You'll grow hair! We'll put a bow in your braid. and you will be beautiful! Peter Lebersen is leaving today. His uncle is going to take him home with him. When are you going to take me? Your mother and father will come take you. You must study hard and wait. I don't want any of the arrested ones back! Don't talk like that. You have good parents! No!! They are enemies of the people! They wanted to kill Stalin. They should be shot! It's a sin to talk like that! You should be ashamed! Not at all! Look!! Peter's parents were shot and now his uncle takes him home. Take me home. I can't stay here any longer! Vera pinches me and she put a frog in my bed yesterday. They used to come see Vera, but nobody comes anymore. They've forgotten her! One day you will forget me! Katya, I will never forget you! You're lying! You're lying! Katya, I love you like my own child! Love me, Aunt Anastasia, please love me! Be my mother! Comrade Sanshin? -Yeah! Follow me. Follow me. Where are we going? We're almost there. Didn't expect to see a familiar face, did you? Sir! Be seated Sanshin, be seated. Let's have a nice talk with you in comfort. Fyodor, bring us some tea. So you've been working for us for three years now. Two years actually. You puzzle me, Ivan. You're not a bad guy. Two years in the KGB ranks. Yet, um.. No outward sign of patriotism. or political awareness. or petulance. I don't understand, Comrade Colonel. Now in two years, you didn't bring us a single report! denouncing some.. suspicious persons.. or requesting an investigation. Comrade Colonel, just look at the people I work with! We've all been screened and tested a thousands times. Even the janitors have a rank in the security course. -Who's talking about janitors? If I had seen anything suspicious, I would have reported it immediately! I'm not talking about janitors! Now confidential, Sanshin... We've got information that an attempt on Comrade Stalin's life is being plotted. The web involves the top brass. I can't give you their names, but the potential assassin has free access to the Kremlin. Do you understand? This isn't the first conspiracy. If it weren't for Comrade Beria, The Master would have been... ... you know! Now you can go. By the way... Is it you.. or your wife... who is related to this man.. Gubelman, arrested in 1939? Related?? What are you saying? A neighbor by this name... Was arrested and we moved into his room to improve our living conditions.. I've got information that your wife goes to Pokrov... to the orphanage to see Katya Gubelman, 6 years of age. As your wife's statement.. She calls herself the girl's aunt! Is that her signature? Damn it! I forbid her! But she keeps whining that the child is not guilty! That's it! Tomorrow I dump her! Don't break up the family to hastilous action. But it needs to be reprimanded. Fortunately, the report landed on my desk. So, I'm not going to show it to anyone. But you have to do something to justify my trust. Work hard, Sanshin. Work hard. Work hard. No more! No! I won't give her up for anything! Quiet, quiet! She is my daughter! -Are you crazy?!! You better stop. I'm not as good wife to you. What are you doing? What are you doing? Why have you done this Anastasia?! They can arrest us at any time now! What for? For being a relative of a traitor to the motherland. You wrote it yourself. I saw it! You! Stating that you're her relative! They wouldn't have let me see her if I didn't. How long have you been seeing her?? -How Long? -Two years. Don't you care anything about me? I'm working in the Kremlin, and now they list me as a relative of these Gubelmans. They can do anything with me now. But you said Comrade Stalin loves you. Stalin has nothing to do with it. They even put Molotov's wife in prison. and you're talking about me??? They won't even tell him what happened to me! They'll just say I got sick and that will be the end of it. got sick with tuberculosis. Anyone at home? Don't you ever knock? I did. But there was no answer, comrade Sanshin. Telephone for you. I suppose they couldn't wait. I knocked, but you didn't answer! You're going to live in there? She calls me Mother. And I promised I wouldn't abandon her. Who do you love better? Me or Katya? Who do you love better? Me or Comrade Stalin? Comrade Stalin, of course! And I love you! Most of all in the world! On 22 June 1941 Hitler betrayed the Master, launching Blitzkrieg across our border. Russia was in flames, Our invincible troops, destroyed. Comrade Stalin sat alone watching the captured fascist news reels. We all waited to learn how he would save us. Nine weeks later The Nazi tanks were 7 mi. From the Kremlin. The Master ordered the government to evacuate Moscow. Where are we going? To Kuibyshev. The whole government's moving to the Urals. It's the first train with Political Bureau members. I have to start up a screening and they've hired you as a waitress! Somebody has to serve tea to the top brass, and they're short of hands. I will explain it all to you on the train. Have you got a decent bra? This one shows through the blouse. I have nothing clean. It's ok, it's ok, we will cover it up with the apron. I don't know, Ivan! I'm so clumsy.. I spill tea in our own house. Here.. Look at how it's shaking. -Just don't fill the glasses to the top. Their carriages don't shake much, they're so heavily armoured. They just glide. You'll be serving the most important people. Remember, no questions. So carriages 14 and 15... Sanshin, Ivan and Anastasia, right? So you go to carriage 18 And you'll.... -11. Carriage 11. Well go to carriage 11. Comrade Lieutenant will accompany you. Welcome. Take this. Come in. Good evening. For fizzy water... May I go? What's your name? Anastasia. Just like the czar's daughter.. What a beauty she was. And you're no worse. Have you ever tasted roast sturgeon with lemon? Just taste it and you'll smack your lips! A little salt... That's it. Do you drink? Sometimes. There are two things you can not trade even for gold. Love and health. Will you drink my health? To the bottom! For one's health, you must drink to the bottom. Take a bite, or you'll get drunk. I'll feed you! Come on... Be seated. No, I'm not allowed. I'm master here. I allow you. Sit down! You know all the people are scared of you? But you're kind of... Kind of what? Kind of funny. That's right. And for that, women love me. Let's drink to Stalin. No, no, that's enough I cannot drink anymore. You refuse to drink to Stalin? I was so worried... Did you serve them alright? Who was it? Beria. Did you drink? It was his date. Where is your bra? Bra? I think I lost it. Have you packed your things? Where is she going? To carriage 11. According to regulations, a waitress must stay close to the kitchen! day and night. You must be tired! I'll accompany you. And you stay here! Lover Boy. Sanshin! Word come on the wire from Lieutenant General Vlasik You are wanted back there. Urgently, so don't unpack! You'll go by this train. Back where? Back to Moscow. They say the Master changed his mind about leaving. But what about my wife? Wife? I came here with my wife. She's enlisted as a waiter. She's in the carriage 11. Oh, your wife. Of course. Don't worry. She's still enlisted, and she'll work in the Council of Ministers. I haven't seen her in two days! I would like to say goodbye. You have a pass to enter Comrade Beria's carriage? If not, you'd better stay here. You will return to Moscow, in half an hour. German bombs fell as I walked from the train station. I couldn't recognize my city, my street, even my neighborhood school was a burned out ruin. But Moscow would survive. Comrade Stalin remained in the Kremlin to protect us. Who's there? I'm armed! I will shoot! Come out now! There are many of us here. Calm down, Professor! It's just me! So you didn't go away? Gone and back. My boss decided to stay in Moscow. Then there are still brave people around! No doubt about it! But where is Anastasia? Anastasia, old man, Is just a fleeting pleasure. Now you see her; Now you don't. What do you mean? I dumped her. Fed up! I sent her to Kuibyshev. I'll file for divorce later. But she's a good woman! Good? Slut! Don't worry, professor! We'll manage somehow, just the two of us. It's a shame! She was always nice to me! She even calledl me "Grandpa". So how do you like it? Well? How do you like it? You can put your eyes back in your head! I just wanted to see you for a minute. Just for fun Besides, the bags are heavy. We're getting off in Dzerginsky. Why Dzerginsky? You think I was expecting you to take me home? I have a room at the KGB dormitory. As a single mother. So why didn't you stay in Kuibyshev? Who the hell meets people in Kuibyshev like this? We're going home! You want me to live with you? We're still married. You kill me! You forgot! You love Stalin better than me! What are you talking about? For you. Why didn't you write me one letter? Not one. In the whole year! I did! I just never sent it. I'm so glad Anastasia is back! And it looks like a baby is on the way! What a rascal you are! You didn't say a word. The porridge will be ready in a minute. I don't understand. You couldn't find a better woman? Ever since you went away, Nastia, I cursed you, I hated you I tried hard to forget you, but every time I get into bed, the pillow smells of you, and I start crying. Do you remember that night, under the bridge? Hiding from the rain? I tried to kiss you, and that stupid dog came out of nowhere and bit me! God.. my only pants! And the smell of your hair... Your hair... I don't need this! I'm going to the dorm! You're going away? Just leave me alone and don't touch me! Can I have some water..? Why do you tell me the pillow smelled like me? Why? I should be killed, I should be crushed! Listen! There is nothing, nothing, that is your fault! It's mine, it's my fault. I didn't stand by you. I didn't fight, I didn't resist! Fighting whom, Ivan? Fight who? Can you guess who the father of the child is? I don't want to know. I don't care! All that matters is that you're here! And we're together. As for the baby, it will be our child, alright? Right? They've called you and asked you to be nice to me haven't they? Haven't they? Do you think the KGB ordered me to write all these love letters to you? Write them every day Read them! Read them, you bitch! I rescued it from a bombed-out school. When the war is over, the pupils will get it back.. Oh, my God! I want some too. You've had one. That's enough. To Your health, my dear! Happy birthday! -Happy Birthday! Nastia! Why don't you eat? This is real chocolate! It's American! I want a mothball. Here she goes.. Grandpa, have you got any mothballs lying around? What for dear? Don't listen to her, Professor. She's gotten it into her head that mothballs are good for her. Good thing I caught her yesterday, before she ate one! I need mothballs! I've got moths inside me! Sometimes they're flying in my head! Sometimes in my stomach. They're very ticklish! The baby's all covered with fur, that's why the moths are there. Nastia, don't start this. Don't start this.. You think I'm telling lies? But Grandpa believes me, don't you? Well. That's enough! Let's go home. I don't want to! You don't love me anymore! He used to love me, and care for me He hid me in the wardrobe! Now he hidess Him there. Stalin! Nastia! Did you know, Grandpa, that Stalin is hiding in our wardrobe? In the Kremlin it's not Stalin, it's the Evil Spirit. Anastasia! I know! I was told everything. It's Satan in the Kremlin! His left hand is all withered. And the toes on his left foot, all grown together like a hoof. That's why he wears those soft boots. And likes to stroll alone.. Between the flowers... Come on. Let's put you to bed. Eat the chocolate, professor! Help yourself! We've got plenty more! I asked him not to drink. We could all go to prison. Don't be afraid, Ivan! They won't touch us. I am held in highest regard by the KGB. the valiant KGB! Look, what a great moon! Katya, must be cold, standing there, by the fence. Waiting. In the nettles. Little Katya Gubelman. It's horrible, professor! Something is wrong in her head. Yesterday, waiting in line, She bit an old woman. Well maybe she's crazy, but what she said is the truth. Satan is in the Kremlin! What? It is Satan. It takes Satan to mesmerize the whole nation to the point where they voluntarily blind and deafen themselves.. What else? What else do you want to say? Historically, the Russian people either side with God or Satan. Now we're dominated by an evil force. And we worship him like worship God. You old man you know nothing! I work in the Kremlin. I work with him. I have the privilege, the happiness to see him! Every day. Who are you? Who sent you? Who are you conspiring with? You stinkin' rat! You think I don't see? I'll bash your head, I'll spread your brains all over these books! Mark my words. If it were not for such good, naive, and trusting Ivans ... as you are... ... He would never have been a tyrant, a murderer, a devil. Now go! Please go! Leave me alone. Goodbye, Ivan. Take my brown wool jacket to Katya. She must be cold. Comrade Stalin! Ah, comrade Sanshin! But why are you here, without your guard? Who should I be afraid of, Ivan? Anything could happen! Let me walk with you! I love walking alone. So you live here? Those are my windows. Isn't it damp in the basement? It's a first-rate basement, comrade Stalin! Warm and dry! How is your wife, kids? My wife is pregnant. Expecting the baby soon. Our first! That's good. Children are our future. So life is good! No complaints, whatsoever! So goodbye, comrade Sanshin! Is something wrong, Comrade Stalin? How long have you worked with me Sanshin? Five years.. in the Inner Circle! They say that I'm suspicious of everyone. But how can I trust anyone, when even you, in the Inner Circle lie to me? You've got no wife. She hanged herself 20 minutes ago. You see, I know everything Everything about everyone. I buried Anastasia in the frozen earth. The KGB paid for the burial. The war was won. Comrade Stalin had saved us. Our nation resumed its march toward the Great Socialist Destiny. But I felt nothing. My heart had been buried too. Ten years of winter passed. Next stop, Slaughterhouse. Ivan, look who's here! Do you recognize her? Do you recognize her? It's Katya, the Gubelmans' daughter! What are you talking about? The Gubelmans! Sonia and Aaron. You lost your memory? I don't remember any Gubelmans. She came to visit you. Do you hear me! I have a rule about visiting. I visit no one and no one visits me. This can't be the one Anastasia told me about! He's the one! Oh please, don't knock! I must go. Are you coming in? Yes! It's better now because, I have my passport. Wait how old are you? 17. 17? That's Right. Have some jam in your tea. Do you like jam? Gooseberry. Full of vitamins. Vitamins are good for you. Do you know what Stalin's favorite jam is? What? What he likes most of all.. Jam with rose petals. How do you know that? I know a lot about Comrade Stalin! He smokes rolled cigarettes flowers brand and he loves to sing a Georgian song ... I forgot the name. .. Zulikov. That's it. So you love Comrade Stalin! I would die for him! If it weren't for Comrade Stalin, I would have been dead a long time ago. He saw to it that I was fed and clothed, and educated by the State. Sorry, I didn't see.. Don't be scared. I won't tell anyone! Do you have relatives? An aunt or someone? Aunt Anastasia has it been long since she died? During the war. She talked about you. A lot. She did? Take it! It's her sweater. It's a little big but it's warm! For me? For you! She was thinking of you just before she died, that.. you were cold and lonely. It's yours now. She asked me to give it to you. She didn't forget me! She didn't forget me! Come on now, don't cry! She was thinking of me! She was thinking of me! Come on, let's eat! Uncle Ivan, what's that on the wall? I don't know. I know.. It's blood. The blood of Aaron Gubelman, my father! What are you saying? I remember! You can'tt remember, you were only 3 years old! I remember he bashed his head against the wall, Then did it again. He wanted to escape from justice. But they wouldn't let him! What an imagination! It's just glue! Nastia spilled it fixing the wallpaper. Come on! The eggs are getting cold. Listen! You shouldn't come here again.. And don't tell anyone that you spent the night here. I was thinking that myself. I might get you into trouble! You see, it's my job... Don't worry, I understand. I didn't want to stay here.. Go ahead! Eat. No I'm full, thank you! I have to go now So where will you go? Oh, it's a big country! I might go to Siberia to work on the dam construction What a silly idea! What's a sparrow like you going to do in Siberia all alone? You should finish school, Go to university, you could be a lawyer, doctor... What are you talking about, Uncle Ivan? I am a Jew! I am a Jew. Let alone my parents enemies of the people. So what? There are Jews even in the government! Oh, Uncle Ivan! You are so naive! Here's some money for you. I have 3,000 rubles saved. And a warm hat for the winter. You're so kind! Aunt Anastasia told me many times how kind you are. Ivan? Phone call for you. Sanshin speaking. -Ivan Sanshin? Ivan Sergeevich. -Sir! You are to report immediately to department 1, room 6. -To see General Schelkasov. -Send a car. It's an emergency! No cars available. Dear Uncle Ivan, I'm leaving behind the money and the hat. I'm afraid someone might steal them. And as for Aunt Anastasia's sweater.. It's dear to you too. So please keep it in memory of her. I love you very, Katya. Why like this? Why on earth like this..?
