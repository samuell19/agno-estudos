[ominous music] [crying] [ominous music] - Do know what it's like to lose your kid? [horn honking] [ominous music] [sirens blaring] [ominous music] [crying] - Drop the gun. - I'm not gonna drop the gun. - Drop the fucking gun! - Fuck you, I won't drop the gun! I lost my baby. I lost my man. I lost everything I had! I don't have anything to be here for! - Talk to me, what's your name? - I don't have a fucking name, and what the fuck do you care what my name is anyway? You're a cop. [crying] Do you know what it's like to lose your kid? I can't even mommy good anymore! I can't do anything any more. [crying] - You don't wanna do this. You don't wanna do it. - Yeah, I do. Yeah, I do wanna do this. Because I'm never gonna use this anymore to feed my kid, and I'm never gonna use this anymore to fuck my man with. You don't fucking know what's going on in my life! [crying] [yelling] [gun firing] [electronic buzzing] [sad music] - No! - Marie, I don't wanna do this, but if you're drivin', I'm gonna have to take your keys. [sniffing] [keys clattering] [sad music] - You ever wonder why cops just hang out with cops? - [Barman] I think that's pretty obvious. - Besides the obvious. - I dunno. - What the hell you talk about? I mean, how the hell do you come home and talk about killin' someone? How do you talk about it? - You don't need this, Marie. Your job's tough enough without kickin' your own ass. - I ain't doing nothing just telling the truth. - It ain't the truth. You were doing your job. That's all it's about, doing your job. - I gotta find a better place to hide. - It's only a second between walking away and a body bag. Personally, I'll take walking away anytime. [clapping] - I feel a whole lot better. - You remind me of your father. You arrogant little shit. [sad music] - Hey cap, I killed a whacked-out emotional basket case with a toy gun in her hand. - It was suicide by cop. You were in immediate danger. [sad music] The department wants you to take some sick time and see a shrink. - I'm not seeing a shrink. - See the shrink, protect yourself. - Fuck 'em. [sad music] - If she's not home in 15 minutes, I'm calling somebody. I'm telling you right now. - She has to quit. Are you okay? We saw you all over the news. - Marie, Marie, it's like all over your father, all over again. - [Marie] Don't start with that [muttering]. - I don't wanna hear it. - You've gotta be kidding me, you let her out of the house like that? - [Daughter] Who are you talkin' to? You're not Daddy, Daddy's dead. - [Marie] You leave the house like that, I'll break your... - Fuck you cop! - Is that a tattoo? - Yeah it is a tattoo. - What the fuck would make you get a tattoo? - Maybe it's 'cause I felt like getting a tattoo, okay, Marie? Huh, look at you! You're always worried about my business, my life, look what you got in front of you! - What'd you say? - Wake up, Marie! - Smell the coffee, look at this asshole! - Girls, enough, enough, enough! That's enough today! She's been through enough today! - Would you please leave? - [Daughter] Mom-- - Just go and do what you have to do. - [Daughter] Whatever, Mom! - You're putting the wood on the fire! - Shush, calm down, calm down. Calm down. - You should be worried about her. - [Marie's Sister] Marie, please. [dramatic music] - It's gonna be okay. - What's that? [dramatic music] - It's uh, well not the best time, but... [dramatic music] - Wow. It's a perfect time. Oh. [dramatic music] [rock music] ♪ I can't wait forever - [Barry's Friend] If this deal works out, we could make a fortune. This is how I got my cabin cruiser, our trip to Europe is written off. - [Barry] Great, that sounds too good to be true, though. - [Barry's Friend] Well, Barry, you know how much I like cabin crusiers. - I had the same reaction but everything is based on use and time of the year. - And tell me how you doing? - I'm doing good. - Yeah? - Barry's great. You know and there's the force a little bit. - I know it's tough making changes I know. - I gained 10 pounds. - No, you don't look it. You look great. - I did. - You really do. - Thanks, how you doing? - [Marie's Friend] I'm great! - It can be done. - Is it legit? - Totally legit. There's nothing to complicate it. - I don't know, you know? - Trust me, trust me. There's nothing-- - [Marie] I'm really good, I'm so happy. - Well let me see that ring. Let me see that ring. [gasping] It's beautiful. I love it. - Thank you. - Oh my God, it's gorgeous. - Thank you. - You are so lucky. You are a lucky woman. I'm so happy for you. - Thanks. - If you say so, but you know what I'd really be interested in talking to your tax man. I really would. - It's no problem. No problem at all. I never expected to have the type of year that I'm having. But... [rock music] ♪ Ah ♪ I can't wait forever - Babe, why the bad mood? - Why'd you tell Jack and his wife... [phone ringing] - Hello? Yeah. For this to work, I need names. This deal has to happen. Yeah. Uh huh. I'll talk to you later. Baby, talk to me. - Why'd you tell Jack and his wife we have a boat? - 'Cause I had to. - Because you had to? What kind of answer is that? - It's part of having an image. It's all about image. - Barry, don't start with that image crap again. I don't want to hear it. I don't like it. - Nobody cares if you're good. They want to see success. I'm just giving 'em what they want, so I can get what I need. - What you need? - What we need for us. I'm thinking about our future. Come on, isn't it nice to have the best things in life? - Barry, you are my best thing in life. I don't care about all the other crap. It's you, all right? [dramatic music] - Stay in the car. Well Barry boy, three weeks, no payments. - I swear Mr. Nadi I was bringing you the cash today. [tongue chittering] - That's only two weeks. You owe me for three not to mention the interest on the first two. - I can-- - Hey, look nobody would lend you this money, and out of the kindness of my heart, I front you the cash. So what are we gonna do about this little problem we got? - Mr. Nadi, I got something really hot going. Just let me show it to you. - We'll talk. [dramatic music] - They're gonna repo these tables and chairs if we don't get our payment out this week. [phone ringing] - Hello? Okay, I'm leaving right now. - Is everything okay? - Yeah, sure, fine. I have to run and meet a client. It's a big deal. I'm just a little nervous over it. I'm doing this all for you, Marie. I love you. - I know. - I just want us to be happy. - Me too. [dramatic music] [phone ringing] Hello? - Hey Marie, it's the captain. I don't know how to tell you this, but there's been a serious accident with Barry. I need you to come to the precinct as soon as you can. [sad music] He went off the Robert Moses Causeway. Things got pretty mangled. Divers haven't located much. Some body parts and a left arm. We're gonna run fingerprints, but I figured that you would be able to identify this first. - It looks like our ring. - I'm so sorry. Look I'll keep you posted on everything. [sirens blaring] [sad music] [dramatic music] - Please forgive me for being so direct, but I know this is the information that you're seeking. Yes, Barry changed his policy to a million dollars, and there's no delicate way to tell you this. You're not the beneficiary. Originally when it was $100,000, you were the intended recipient. But with the change in the amount came the change in beneficiary. - I don't know what to say. - I'm sorry, Marie. I wish there was more I could say, more I could tell you. But it was all done straightforward and in confidence. - Who may I ask is the beneficiary? - A Ralph Nadi, Mr. Nadi. - Ralph Nadi? - He's a local business man. Your husband speculated with him and did some business with him. [dramatic music] - We haven't been able to catch this guy. If he were connected, he'd be Al Pacino in Donnie Brasco, a wannabe. - I knew that name sounded familiar, but I wasn't sure. - Investigators must be crossing tracks. I mean it's natural to take a close look at the beneficiary in a fatal accident. It's pretty obvious to me. - Yeah, but why? I don't mean motive. Money's the motive, but what's behind the whole set up? - If there's anything there, we'll flush it out. [dramatic music] There was some fire damage to the car. There was enough to keep the cars with the failed brakes as inconclusive. I don't know if our boy engineered it or if he's just plain lucky. - I gotta talk to a man about an insurance policy. [dramatic music] - No, we'll do it the same way, that's all. [laughing] That's right. - Mr. Nadi? - Oh hey, I'm gonna have to call you back. Who wants to know? - Barry Green was my husband. - My condolences. - I know about the money, I know about the policy, and I know that you had my husband killed. - What the hell is this? Who the hell is this broad to come over here with this bullshit? - Be nice, be nice, Mikie. - I'll be nice, cunt. - Hey, hey look, sweetie, what's your name? - Marie. - All right, Marie, look first off let me apologize for my associate here. He's a good man just wears his emotions on his sleeve. Now why don't you sit down and join us, and we can talk about whatever the problem is. - There is no problem. I just wanted you to know that I knew. I wanted to come look you square in the eye. [dramatic music] - All right, you came, you saw, now either take me up on my offer, or why don't we just call it a day? - I think I'll call it an afternoon. [dramatic music] - I'll get you the money! I'll get you the money. [coughing] I'll get you the money! [fists bashing] - Now Johnny, you gotta listen to me. I'm talking to ya like a true friend here. With all the money you've been borrowing and all the interest, I don't know how you're gonna catch up. To be honest with ya, these beatings I'm giving ya they really hurt me, you know? You got a wife and kids. I don't want to keep doing this to ya. So I'm gonna give you a chance to catch up. I'm gonna forget about the money that you owe me and the vig just for a little while, not forever. Just enough time for you to show me that you're gonna pay me back, end all this craziness, okay? Okay? But Johnny, you gotta do two things for me, Johnny. Number one, the gambling finished, caput. Understood? All right. And now second, I want you to put me on your life insurance policy just as collateral till you pay me back, okay? Okay. All right, Mikie here is gonna stop by tomorrow, pick up the policy, understood? Understood? [laughing] Right understood, good. All right, let him go.

You better face it. Your husband was a loser. - Piece of shit. - All right, fine, fine, that makes me a piece of shit. But that doesn't leave much difference between me and old Barry boy. I've got a little secret for you, Marie. All that money he'd been borrowing, that was to buy cocaine for all his bullshit friends in the Hamptons. What's the matter, Marie, I don't hear ya? Talk to me, little girl. [laughing] Everybody's got their price. What's yours? - It's not that I thought there was anything fishy. I mean in the financial world there's always something fishy. Here have a seat. - Thank you. - It's just that he seemed to be suddenly flush with cash. I'm not talkin' a thousand or two, I'm talking 10s of thousands. - Well what would you estimate? - Conservatively 50,000 maybe 60,000. He didn't squander it away either. Paid off a lot of debt, God bless him. Look I'm just gonna leave all this here with you. When you're done, you can lock up. I'll be at home if you have any questions or need any further help. Is that all right? - Oh, of course that's all right.

I want you to do something for me. - What's that? I'll do anything. - When we do the deal tomorrow, I'm not gonna be alone.

I can resolve my problem and help you with an embarrassing situation. - Come work for me. - [Marie] Another place, another time. - [Andalini] Nadi's got a deal going down he thinks I don't know about it.

I want all my money, and I want it now. - No, that's not what I had planned. - Listen I've got an opportunity that I just cannot let pass by. - All right, all right when? - You'll get a call. You look like you need a vacation. Why don't you try a few days by the seaside? They say that a combination of the salt air, sun, and sand can trigger a spiritual awakening. Try it. [punching bag rattling] - What are you bothering me for? - [Captain] Marie's alive. - What's that got to do with me? [punching bag rattling] Let me tell you something, Captain. I never touched your Marie, and if you want to start pointing fingers, you better start looking at what she's been doing to me. Yeah, Jimmy Peaches, that was my sister's fiance, dead. Mikie, my friend for 20 years, [gun firing] dead. Tomasino, he and I go way back, dead. And then Vinny, his best friend, dead. And that's not to mention Johnny the artist, two bullets right to the chest. [gun firing] So if we want to talk about calling off the dogs, I think you better talk about calling off that bitch. [punching bag rattling] [laughing] All right, all right, look I'm just a business man, all right? I don't like anything that gets in the way of making a profit. - Like the kind of profit you made off of Barry Green's life insurance policy? - What can I say? That was just an accident. That's life. Which is what you better get across to Mrs. Green. Her husband's dead, move on. - I'm willing to make an offer. I can make evidence disappear. I can give you tips on gambling raids. I'd even give you protection where you just don't have it. - You know if I agree to that, I'd be admitting to a lot of guilt. - You don't have to admit to anything, just agree. [patting] See no wires, I'm clean. - So how you gonna do it? How you gonna stop her? - Don't worry about it. I'll stop her. - All right, we'll try it your way. But if something goes wrong, if I find her within 100 yards of anything I'm doing, I'm gonna go after her, and I'm gonna go after you. Are we understood? - Well as long as we're agreeing on things, if she so much as breaks a fingernail, I'm gonna rain hell down on you. [dramatic music] [ominous music] - [Barry] Bang, you're dead! - Fuck you, asshole. [laughing] - [Ralph] Give me that gun, dickhead. [laughing] - How you guys doing? - Good, good. - The goods, check it out. Would you like to try some? - I don't know why we gotta be in such a rush. [dramatic music] - Andalini wants his million. - It's good stuff. What are you gonna do about him? - Fuck that bonehead. Nobody's gonna mess this thing up. Here's the cash. - Very nice, thank you. - Good stuff. - Mr. Nardi, would you like to try some? It's all right? - There's 10 people on there, my man. 10 people that want to deal, six in the Hamptons, four in the North Fork, and there's plenty more. - You know I oughta take these 10 names, and I oughta pop you right now. [laughing] - You won't kill me because you're just as greedy as I am. [branch snapping] [ominous music] [gun firing] - Hello Barry. - Hello Marie. We gotta talk. We gotta make a deal. - What kind of a deal? - One where you get rich, and I live. - They nearly killed my mother and sister. Did you know that? You son of a bitch. - I am so sorry about that, but I had no choice. Nadi was gonna kill me. - I loved you. I did all this for you. I didn't want them to get away with taking your money. We were married. We were gonna spend the rest of our lives together. - I know I lost control, but it was Nadi. It wasn't me. Don't you get it? - Yeah if I sell my soul to the devil like you did. - No, not my soul, Marie, just an arm. It was a small price to pay to get that insurance policy. Me and Nadi could've made maybe 10, 20, 30 million. - Now Nadi's dead. - So I'll get another goomba, take his place. [laughing] Baby, you and be could be sitting on top of the world together. - Me and you, right? - Baby, listen to me, it's Barry. It's Barry. I know I lost control, but it was Nadi. It wasn't me. Don't you get it? - Yeah, I get it. Believe me, I get it. Marie, you wouldn't kill an unarmed man. - I'm not gonna kill you, Barry. You're already dead, remember? [gun firing] [grunting] - Hello my dear, you know I really enjoyed your work. You're truly something special. You want the money? Take it, but my offer still stands. If you would consider it a retainer, I will consider it an investment. - You know I heard the food here is really good. - I didn't come here to eat. I think you have a briefcase that belongs to me. - Here's the deal. - No deals, just the briefcase.
