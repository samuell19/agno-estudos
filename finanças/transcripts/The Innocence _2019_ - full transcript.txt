THE INNOCENCE -I'm cool with it. -No, actually. You could put a where it would work out for me. I like this one. Have you seen what they say about her in the village? It's just that it's a town, You're saying it all yourself. If she brings it up, it's okay. But it's just that Marta is Marta. Marta is Marta and he's earned that reputation. But then it's not about the pose so everyone's talking. If it's on the lips of the people, it'll be for something. I don't want him to think I'm chasing him. If you're a couple. -What? -You're engaged. He's not my boyfriend! Everybody knows that, don't make yourself beg. That he's not my boyfriend. That he's not my boyfriend. Good one, that one. Will you time me for a minute? Okay, wait. By the way, have you heard from the Polack yet? The Polack? Yes, I asked my father. He calls him "the farm tourist" because it looks like... write down in a notebook everything they do... and just watch. And you live by the story? No, I think he's studying on a scholarship. Organic farming, I think. Eco-agriculture... yes. Well, he's cute, at least. Good night. Why are you walking down the street so low? -Leave it, it's hot. -But not on the street. It can't be on the street. The other day, Paula, the one with the artichoke boiled, he was wearing a pair of shorts and he was walking down the street and you could see everything. -What are you going to do? -He's got a lot of hips. I don't know how they let her go dressed like that. The ones you have, you have to show them. Mom, can I have some money? Ask your father. Can't you give it to me? You know why, but are you leaving now? -You haven't had dinner. -I'll eat later. -Can't you give me some? Ask your father. -You haven't showered. -Yes, in the pool. -Are you going to the club? -I am. -Yes. -How old is he? -He's not. -He's 15 now. -What a major. -15? He's already very old. -Do you already have a boyfriend? -No. You're going out with someone, aren't you? You haven't thrown in the towel. -I'm leaving. -Don't leave without laying out the towel. -Don't you change for the club? -I don't know. -After. They don't change because they're already changed underneath. Girl! Listen to your mother! -Where are you going? -To Sara's house. At Sara's house they do seances. Spiritism? I control my daughter by her cell phone. Auntie, can't you see you're burning my hair? I told you it was wet. Don't iron it for me anymore. -Are you going to go with witch's hair? -No. -Yes, a witch's hair, like your mother. Well, I'll fix it up for you, that's curly, and then I smooth it out for you. You don't suffer that I control. -Man, good timing. -Look at that outfit for tonight. Do you like it, with the grids on? Do you like it or what? To go to dinner tonight with her boyfriend at the bar. He's not my boyfriend. He's your boyfriend, all right. One: he is your boyfriend. Two: come on. We'll pretend... -like we're going to dinner, too. -that we didn't paint anything. -And they'll say, "Come." -Who's there? The coolest people in Alcanar and all the elders of Traiguera. Let's go yes or yes. -I don't. -We are. If you want, you go, I'm staying home. Are we going in or what? Do you know what you're doing? My father lets me come to the disco. And does your house know who you're going with? I've already spoken to your father, tell him I let you in, pyrite. Do you have a clinex? Roc?o! Come on, give me a clinex, there isn't one. Roc?o! Fuck, man, you never have anything. Do you know who you're messing with? Do you? What you have to do is hit it hard. What are you doing here, honey? -I'll go with you. -She's my girlfriend. Wait here, honey. This has nothing to do with you. -Who is it? -I don't know. I don't understand anything. I'm freaking out. -And us less. -What's going on? That I don't draw a line in front of this one. Tomorrow the whole town knows, you're crazy. You don't say anything. You, discreet. Get out of the way, you gossiping little shit. -Where are you going in such a hurry? -To the dance. -Wait a minute. -Catalan. There aren't any more of these girls. Girls with these pears and everything... But what pears? Shut your big mouth. When you were young, you liked them like that. -But not now. -Things touch when they touch. I'm off. -Where to? -To the dance. -They let you into the club? -No. -Yes. My daughter was not allowed in at the club... How old is he? Not old enough for you. Too few for you. -And I talked to the bowling alley and he passed it on. -Pay him a cube. A Malibu with pineapple? -Do you want something? -No. -Are you in a hurry? -Yes, I've got a date. Careful, you're running out of money. It's packed. Hey, rooster, you leave that glass there and you take a plastic one. The glass stays here. Where's this one from? I don't know, from Alcanar, but he came in with your daughter. But you were coming together? Did they arrive together? What guy were you dancing with yesterday? -Va, tell us. -Nobody. -Who was it? -Nobody. Dancing and what's not dancing. No one, it's a lie. What guy were you dancing with? -With none. -With whom? -Don't you remember? Don't you remember who you were dancing with or didn't you dance with anyone? I wasn't dancing with anyone. And you didn't smoke either, did you? I don't smoke. You're going to smoke, liar. Did you smoke? -I don't smoke, I'm a sportsman. -Listen! You're not even old enough to go out, or to go with boys not to smoke or anything like that. So he brakes. or you're out of business. You're running out of money to be all day long playing dumb. And no smoking. I only smoke here, period. Is that clear? Is that clear or not? Yes or no? Yes, but it's a lie. What? -Which is a lie. -Don't answer it! Get me a yogurt. I don't want any more. You finish it. You finish the plate, you go. Do I eat it with my hands? Have you seen the website from the circus school? -Yes, the trapeze thing and... -You haven't seen it. -I saw the pictures that I... -You're an asshole. I saw the pictures you showed me. -There was a trapeze, and a tent... -It's a giant tent. Circus. And it's all padded inside. And there are trapezes and ropes to do circus, it's very cool. -What little I saw, I liked. -It's a blast. I called and they told me that in June of the year there's proof of access coming up. Next year? -And what do your parents think about that? -I haven't told them anything. -What are you looking at? -What are you looking at, that you don't stop? Me, nothing. Now that's a light penis, not like Nestor. Shall we say hello? I'm just so embarrassed. -You say hello. -Wait. Bogdan! Bogdan! -What? -Come on. We're going to play fronton? No, man, not the gable again? -You know the Polack? -I do, yes. -What if you ask him for the skateboard? -I don't know. -You ask him. -Come on, man. -You ask him. -Va, Bogdan. -Is the boy from yesterday your boyfriend? -Yes, he is. -Yes, but don't say anything. -Does he touch your teats? Shall I touch your face, you useless man? He's my boyfriend but don't say anything. -Ask him for the skateboard. -I'm not. -Come on, man. -Not at all. -Should we show him the stunts? -No. -Okay. Hey, Polack! What are you doing? Superman! You guys are getting better and better, huh? Look at this, Lee! You're a superskater. Come on! -Stay. -We've been looking for you all afternoon. No, let's go. Do you want us to introduce you to the Polack? Took you long enough, huh? -Hey, Polack, come here. -Can we go? These are our friends Patri and Rocio. What? -Your hair. -Thank you. Let's go. Thank you. See you later? Yes, of course. Goodbye. Mommy! What are you doing? -I'm working. -He won't let me come in and change. I'm not going to the procession? -What are they doing? -Drugging, as usual. Really, huh? That's a hell of a thing. You already know this. Really, girls. Tell her, she always does this. Open up, your sister has to go and it has to be changed. That I have to come, that I'm working, it's embarrassing. -He won't open up. -Shut up. Do you hear me or what? Yolanda! Is it possible? Yolanda, I'm serious! Open up! You want me to break the door? Get a hammer. Have you thought about it? I count to three. That's enough. -Here, Mom. -Leave it. I'm throwing it out, you hear me? One... Two... Yolanda, I'll throw it away, huh? -Three... -But let's see. Are you guys out of your minds or what? Relax, please. Are you stupid or what? I'm working. and your sister has to change. Everybody out, come on. Come on. Don't go too far. that we'll talk about this later. -Did you hear me? -Yes. Goodbye. Bye, girls. See you. I'm coming, Merche! Come on, snap out of it. You're gonna freak out about the top. that my sister has bought herself. It's so cool. Sara, so, your mother, what does she do for a living? What do you care what he does for a living? Very good. Alicia. I don't like what you did yesterday. Do you hear me? Are you listening to me? Don't let it happen again. Don't let it happen again. Close the fridge. I'm always telling you. Take the stuff and close it. What? You want everyone to talk about us? Is that what you want? This afternoon you and I are going to the priest, and you apologize to him. -No. -Yes. You are no longer of age to do such foolish things. In the procession it's a fault of brutal respect. Do you understand? -Do you understand? -Yes. What's going on? What's going on? Well, this one did the idiot in the procession. Dressed as a... -slutty. -The girls are dressed like that. But no one forced her to go to the procession. You forced her? No, I didn't force her. Well, neither do I. I'm not saying, Paco, that... that she has to be religious, that's not what I'm saying. But if you go... and I didn't force her to go either... If he goes, he should respect people. -Okay, Sole. -Okay, you'll figure it out. Dad. I wanted to ask you something. Would you pay for me to go to school in Barcelona? A school in Barcelona? Aren't there any schools here? Not from the circus. -From? -From the circus. A circus school? Are there circus schools? A circus school! You look like hell. The holidays are over. Lis, have you seen Nestor? You don't say. -What's the matter with you? -Nothing. -Sara. -What? -Your mother's a gracious healer? -What? Is she a healer? Don't you know she's a witch? Witch of what? She's a witch, all right. Save the rule. on a boat in the fridge. I don't know what rule he keeps, if you don't have it anymore. Hey, and when you were born, did he eat your bag? So what if he ate it? The bag? Yes, the placenta. Yes, Auntie, the placenta. A lot of people do, it's the 21st century. -Maybe he keeps his ruler in the fridge. -You made that up. We don't keep it in the fridge. We give it to the earth. Stop it now, I'm gagging. -It's more disgusting to flush it down the toilet. -More disgusting for you to keep it. Then you use the tampons and all that filth. I keep it, too. -See? -Since when? -You think it's pretty normal, don't you? -Yes. I'm going to take a poll to see who else thinks it's normal keep the fucking rule. You do everything with Instagram, don't you? My friend, well my friends they keep the ruler in a jar in the fridge. Do you keep it too? Natural Remedies taught me that. Thank you. Ask them too whether they have brains or not. Put: "Does Roc?o have, or not?" -More than you, I'm sure. - "More than you, for sure..." Then you ask why we don't tell you anything. My friends keep their period in a boat in the fridge. You too? Natural Remedies taught me that. Thank you. My friends keep their period in a boat in the fridge. You too? Tell that to your mother. You ask him. -Ask him about the consultation. -But she's my mother. I'm embarrassed. I don't get it. -I'm embarrassed. -You ask him. I'm making sage, Would you like a little glass? -What is sage? -A herb. It's very good. It's going very well for a lot of things, Do you want to try it? How are you, Alicia? Nothing, my parents... It's just that I want to study circus at a school in Barcelona. And my parents won't let me. And they don't listen to me when I give them my reasons, and I don't know what to do. I want to get to study there, but I don't see how. If I don't get away... -When do you want to do it? -Next year. Aren't you going to study? Sure, I'll just finish the ESO and go. It's like a... a training cycle. They are also studies. It's just like high school. But you already specialize in the circus. -Circus, how nice. -I know. I don't understand why they won't let me. But maybe you have than to talk about it any more. Mom, aren't we going to Barcelona next week or the week after that? -To the flowers. -Yes, why do you say that? Because she hasn't seen the school in person. And he's in Barcelona. You could come with us. If her parents leave her, That's fine with me. They can't say no to you. You come, you come back to us... -For me, perfect. -Yes? -Shall we? -Come on. I want to see the school too. Tell your mother. which I'm sure will leave you. Let's go. -You're leaving? -Yes. Ask him about the consultation. -You ask him. -Go, Sara! Mom, Lis wants to tell you something. Who's Lis? Alicia, there's something I want to ask you. Nothing, what... Remedios and Sara go to Barcelona and I've been invited to go with them to see the circus school. And that, if I can go. Me, Sara and her mother, that Natural Remedies, I don't think it's funny. A woman who... has two daughters without fathers, all their lives. It's not normal. It's weird. But that has nothing to do with it. You have to see that I don't like it. I don't want you going with that... nowhere. Can't I go? It's one day. But you... Until you're old enough, you don't have than going to Barcelona to do anything. What's your job in Barcelona? See the school, and the tests. The tests for what? I told you, I want to be a circus performer. Yes, of course. Circus performer, right? The artist, here she is. The circus artist, watch out. Circus performer. Do one thing, circus artist. Bring me a yogurt. Why don't you go? Make no mistake! Make no mistake about it. and look who you're talking to! See who you talk to. You're not talking to minders. chops from those friends of yours. Watch out for me! Careful, the only one here What a burden I am! You don't carry anything! And if I tell you to bring me a yogurt, you bring it to me. Do you understand? I don't carry anything. What are you denying? What are you carrying? Two boobs like two wagons, Doesn't it piss you off? Let it all out. It stings a little. Let it come in, let it take effect. Tell me what's wrong with you. Come on, you can do it. Take it out. I'll help you get him out. Think about it, let's get it all out there. To make room for it. You're very brave. Very brave. There it is. I need you to help me get an abortion. But I'm not a doctor. They say you can do it roughly. And I'm sure you've got some rue. Look, Alicia. I'm going to help you in any way I can. Anything I can do to help you. But you're gonna have to talk to your mother and tell him you're pregnant. I can't talk to my mother. Alicia, this is something... what you have to face. You have to tell him. Things aren't just because, are for you to learn something. This happened so you could fix something. And you have to take responsibility. You can't run away. If I'm okay. What I don't want is for my parents to find out. That's the only problem. You didn't do acupuncture? I read that the Chinese abort with acupuncture. It's an abortion and that's it. Even if you decide to have an abortion, and you're within your rights, you should be aware that you're carrying a being that grows inside you, and that you, voluntarily, you've decided to cut off his life. You should know that. In order to heal you have to face and take responsibility... of things. This... will be with you all your life. It's like that. And it can go badly with you, if we get it wrong, or it'll be a good companion and make you grow up. Have you spoken to the father? My father? Not if I haven't talked to my mother, not with my father either. With the father. The father, your boyfriend. -Did you talk? -No. But he has a right to know. I'll give you some Bach flowers. -Are they useful for abortion? -Oh, Alicia, honey. Alicia, come set the table for your father! He'll be here soon. -Are there any vegetables? -Yes. How was your day? Good? Mari Carmen told me that you've been to the Remedies office. What did you go and do? How did you find out about that? I don't know, you know this finds out about everything. What did you go for? What did you want? Talk to her. Can't you talk to anyone else? Can't you talk to me? -Mom, I don't know. -What do you mean, "I don't know"? If you have a problem, you can talk to me. I don't have any. And you liked it? Is it very expensive? He didn't charge me. He didn't charge you? Then I'll go too. You'll be charged. Well, I'll pay you. Well, so what? He makes ointments and stuff, right? Do you want to go? Do you want to go? I want to know what he does. -Can't you explain it to me? -Go and ask him. Can't ask you anything, huh? -It's just that you overwhelm me. -You're struggling for nothing! I just wanted to know if you do... potions. Yes, potions. Well, I'm off. Don't be long. Your father's coming right over. How did you find out about this that I went to your mother's office? What do you say? Nothing can be done about it. in this shitty town. -Calm down, let her be. -I'm just up to my eyeballs. She's a pain in the ass. Can't talk. Hey. -It's from my mother, for you. -What are you doing? You want me to talk or what? Let her be. That's for you to take. -What do I do with this? -On the tongue. -What do I do? -You take it... You put it on your tongue. Don't you know the last one from Pablito? That he's come out of the closet, the faggot. -Who? -Pablito. All our lives we call him Pabla, it's as clear as day. It was bound to happen. What's going on? Am I gonna have to go out there from the closet or what? Now you're a dyke or is it just to give the note as usual? -You're the one who's giving the note. -You, you. Dyke. Will you hold my legs? -Does she have a boyfriend? -Yes. And his father? I remember he said he preferred a faggot son than one of the PSOE. What are you going to remember if you weren't born, ghost? I remember him saying that. Wait. Listen to me. I just found Pabla's boyfriend. Look, he's got it on his Instagram. What is wrong with you people, really? It's not like it's so strange, that he's gay. It's just that you're so up to date, you're very modern. -Get me down. -What more do you want? -I don't know. Look how he comes down from doing the pine. Do you have a problem? And you? Where's Alcanar's boyfriend? -Hidden. -Will you introduce us? Give the coke away and us, nothing. -If you want coke, you buy it. -What about you, what I do? Don't you know it's always hidden? Or is it? No, of course, he's fucking the English guy. Now you don't say anything. -You're overdoing it, tonight. -Yes, very much so. The dyke and the circus... -What do you want to study? -I've got it super clear. I want to be like Sara's mother. Witch. And live by the story. Are you a subnormal, or what's wrong with you? What happened to Rocio? -What happened? -What do you care? Mari Carmen is downstairs. He says you hit him, is that true? Don't hit me! -What do you want them to say about us? -What difference does it make? Right now you get dressed and go to apologize to him. -Is he downstairs? -Yes. Do you know why I hit him? I don't care why. Because he's a bad person! Will you stop? What will they think of us? Again with "what will they think of us"! Do you mind? -Yes! -Don't hit me, damn it! You scold me because I hit someone and you hit me. -Because you say he's a bad person. -He's a bad person! -Do you want me to hit you again? -No. Sorry. If you're waiting for me to apologize, I'm not going to do it. I don't know why you're here. if you have nothing to say. Because you called me. I called you because you hit him. Or do you think I wanted to see your face? Didn't you ask him why did we hit him? I don't care why. -And what are we doing here? -The reason is the least of our worries. What happens is that you hit him. It seems to me that these are things that they have to solve. Does it seem normal to you, too. the girl's attitude? It's not that it's or ceases to be normal, is that they're 15 years old. -Mothers shouldn't be here. -They're not little three-year-old girls. They're all grown up, and that's why I think it's more serious the beating he took. Because if they're girls, they pull their hair and give each other two cakes. If you apologize to him and you don't know why, it's not good for anything. Educate your daughter so this doesn't happen. Neither Mari Carmen nor Mari Carmon. If we're here, let's set an example. If we start like this, the example we give them is not good. You're quiet. because your daughter hasn't been beaten. If your daughter had been beaten, maybe you'd breathe differently. Maybe you wouldn't find everything so normal. Maybe she's earned it, You haven't asked him? -What do you mean, you've earned it? -I don't know. -Don't you earn it every day? -I don't have a purple face. -Tomorrow you'll wear it. -Let's see if it's true. -You'll see. Let's do one thing. Let them explain what happened. Then we'll know who's to blame. Then we'll know who's guilty. Explain. Why do we want to know the guilt? Guilt is useless. Guilt, forgiveness, are words that the Church has invented it. -Blame doesn't exist. -Yes, there is. It was invented by the Church. -Guilt and forgiveness are useless. -These are moves that you think. It's not their fault, is yours, especially yours. -Because of the education you've given him. -Perfect. It's my fault, don't you think? I'll take it all home with me. We've already got the culprit. And so now we can talk... They can talk, who are 15 years old as 15 suns, and not the three mothers here I don't know what we're doing. They can talk and work things out. Knowing the guilt or not, it doesn't make any sense. -The tame cat. -And now that we have the culprit, -we're leaving. -Yes, I don't know what we're doing here. Good morning. What happened to you? You can go now, no wonder that they say you're a witch. She's a witch, don't trust her one bit. -Calm down, Mari Carmen. -Wake up, you'll see. -In two days they'll be friends again. -Yes, super friends. These friends don't need to be. Look at her friends. I've got some balls. She's beautiful. If it doesn't go with you, we wouldn't have met her. Where's the biggest one? He's in Alicante, studying. I'll tell him to come and see you. How do you do it with her? Because I'm with her all day... All mothers of this age we're the same. Good thing you're telling me, because I it's like I'm talking to a wall. But we were like that too. It's just that she came and he didn't want to explain anything to me. And I was telling him to explain it to me, -because I'd like to come here one day. -That's right, from inside. Because the stuff from the practice are from each other. -By the way, I want to come too. -Whenever you want. -He'll leave you... cute. -See? But beautiful and all? You already are. What are you laughing at? What's so funny? What happened to this little girl... the daughter of Mari Carmen la Conchita? That he's a bad person. Well, he must have gone out to his mother, if he's a bad person. We've been to Remedios' house and we've decided to go to Barcelona with them. -At Remedios' house? -Yes. Natural Remedies? Remedios and his daughter go to Barcelona and we'll sign up in the car. In two weeks, to see the school. The girl's circus school. To Barcelona? Sole, we've already talked about it 30 times. This one is ageless. to study in Barcelona, okay? First he just studied here and then we'll see about that circus nonsense. But it's just going to see her. You don't have to go to Barcelona. Yes, to see the school. You're not going to see the school, especially not with this one, the Natural Remedies, who is a danger and a witch. Well, I want to go to Barcelona. And I want to go to Cuba! You're not going, period! And if you go to Barcelona with Remedios, you don't turn me to see the hair. -But if... -Shut up, I'm talking to your mother! You stay here and that's it. She's very nice, Remedios. I don't care if she's nice or not! I'm nice when I want to be, too. Fuck's sake! Then let him go. A respect for your father. I don't know why you haven't gotten a divorce yet. Pray I don't get divorced. Pray, because if someone is going to pay you the school in Barcelona, will be him. -No. -Because I, cleaning houses... I'm telling you, no. -I can work and I'll pay for it. -Yes, you work. I want to see you. You'll see me. Shut up. Shut up about what? The bitch only knows how to hit me. Are you okay? Let it be, what a fool they can't be, really. But what do we do? If you want, I can call my mother, but I'm not going back on that bus. All right, call her, fucking call her. And we go back to Traiguera with her and then... we watch a movie or play a game. A movie? What about the math test? Bogdan. Bogdan. Motherfucker, what are you doing here? Get out of here. Now you want the racket and the sticks. Here. Go on, get the fuck out of here. Goodbye. Where's the Polack? -Where's the Polack? -The Polack? He's already gone. Where to? What do I know, his house. His scholarship has run out and he's gone. He didn't say anything to you? Very friendly wouldn't be, if he hasn't told you anything. Either you help me or you don't bother, that I have a job. Get over here. What is this for? What a little smell... To clean up bad vibrations. It cleans up the good vibrations. Leave the good ones, take the bad ones. Isn't the smell good? I told your sister and she's tripping, with how square she is. Reme says that if I'm a few weeks doing this, the house will be a haven of peace and quiet. Can you believe it? Very good. That's how we clean up all the bad stuff. It is powerful, this! What's the matter, daughter? What's going on? Don't cry, you're breaking my heart. Tell me. What's the matter with you? If I tell you something, will you be angry? No, of course not. Are you sure? Sure, tell me. Come on, you'll make me cry in the end. Come on, tell me. -What's going on? -Won't you be angry? Of course not. Tell me what's wrong with you. Are you sure? Okay. I'm pregnant. Holy... Mom, I'm sorry. "Sorry" doesn't cut it. "Sorry" doesn't cut it. You've been cheating on me all summer. You cheated on me. How far along are you? -How far along are you? -I don't know. I don't know... Tell me it's not true, daughter. -Tell me that's not true! -It's true. Please, don't be like this. You're a liar! Liar! Liar, cheat! -I don't want to have it. -What about me, you don't want to have it! You shouldn't even have him here. That's what you shouldn't have! What about you? And what do you do? You get pregnant! Is that all right with you? It's very easy. You just spread your legs and that's it. You're a disgrace to the family, Alicia.
