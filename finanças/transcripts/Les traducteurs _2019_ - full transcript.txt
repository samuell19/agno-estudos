I moved to Paris 20 years ago After you. I didn't know you were young "Dadelos" was my first job I was training when the first part was released Nobody wanted to translate it. I was successful Do you usually sleep on the seats? I arrived yesterday, and this is my first visit to Paris. I wanted to take advantage of my time It seems that I overrated This home owns a Russian billionaire One of the biggest fans of "Daedelus" He is convinced that the end of the world is imminent Thanks to this obsession We will be able to protect the novel "Oscar Braque". Please Your mission involves hard work and reputation Simultaneous translation for a global release It is the first of its kind clever ideas from "Angstrom" It guarantees political commitment That he protect the writers he contracts from any hacking attempt Consider your success Because you are one of the countries where "Daedalus" achieved overwhelming sales Our goal is to make your isolation very comfortable You will see your rooms tonight Let's say each room is the size of the apartment in which I live With private bathroom The use of the Internet is strictly prohibited We will distribute international newspapers to you every morning And you can benefit from a huge movie library Breakfast is served at 8 in the morning And lunch at one and dinner at 9 pm Except for Sundays, business hours are from 9 am to 8 pm Mr Angstrom is very strict about time Nice idea to live the end of the world, right? Please To be buried alive to translate this account is inevitably the end of the world Sorry, excuse me Erik ... Dario Farrelli, how pleased I was to see you did you know Me? Yes, as I knew others Please sit down - Sit down. - Yes It is the first twenty papers I doubt that he will forget the time to provide you with an excellent translation in the afternoon only I am going to collect pages tonight and I will return it to you tomorrow With the following twenty pages if needed You should read the third book with its 480 pages and translate it And so you have another month to audit The library includes comprehensive core knowledge books More than any other library Do you not like this place, Mr. Kedrinus? If I wanted to share the workplace with others When I chose this profession Computers and papers don't leave this room The smoking room is at the end of the hallway, Mrs. Elvis. The mission of our Russian friends is to keep an eye on you Okay Work hard, everyone Or as we say in "France", good luck After two months Bois d'Arcy prison, France I did not think you would agree to see me Feeling guilty is not bad take They published it anyway Bet on what happened to increase sales take him I brought it for you Your booty, sort of As you see, Only one percent of the books that I receive annually deserve publication Of this small percentage, only 10 percent achieves sales Among these books is one or two best sellers It took me years To ensure the success of Angstrom Publishing House You attack a sector that employs millions of people, And generates billions! You will never survive I read it again and again I tell myself that the solution is in the text I can't get this idea out of my head I have to understand how you did that The manuscript did not leave me from the moment Oscar Barak gave me. Except for the two of us, The manuscript did not touch anyone else However I managed to get it when? You do not need to give me this look I will know everything in the end Do you want a little bit of it, Javier? no thanks We must be careful We will live two months of extreme tension Tension does not seem to affect everyone What? You cover a little and dribble Yes Don't be aware of how lucky you are to be here at this age - You must be talented. - Yes, he's very talented In sleep We all have their own way of working, right? I did not sleep well recently In any case, I do not immediately translate My thoughts should be cooked True, translation is difficult without full text It is necessary to form a comprehensive idea - "Angstrom" treats us like robots - no! He is only careful Do you flatter him or what? He is clearly a sadistic man This is very frustrating The moment we were to discover Rebecca's drowning And why? I feel sometimes Frank's investigation will reveal that Rebecca has simply committed suicide ... - To save him from his past - no This is very disingenuous What if it was Frank who killed his wife? Acted under the influence of "Daedalus" and without his knowledge of it "Rebecca" created the virus And Frank made her field of experiments So she got back on it No This makes the story trivial Yes The idea is illogical We have been waiting for this result for two years Two years lost time It is not about literary work but rather a promotional idea The end It will not make the book a masterpiece what are you talking about? It is the most popular in the world Made sales of one billion dollars Remind me, how much is your share? nothing! "Oscar Braque," like the rest of the book It will continue to create profitable ideas one by one He will continue to write the book itself Until he paid off his cottage in Switzerland. Daedalus has become the subject of research at a number of European universities The goal is to transform universities into commercial institutions I know because I am a university lecturer in Athens. So what are you doing here? This is unbearable Do what you do I bow to global capital to push poverty out of my door Yes, and we bow with joy Personally, I have no choice You talk about it as a simple act Devoting ourselves to "Daedalus" is a great honor Rebecca. Or the ghost that you turned to because of it Frank had trouble separating them Rebecca's existence became blurred a ticket... The guilt he felt in those deadly hours This feeling grew constantly thanks to fleeting images Infer that from the tragedy that never left him Rebecca. Her long black hair roams the Seine Her hair shades reflected the lights of passing boats Her dress ripples around her like white wings Good evening Good evening Thank you good night Mr. Farrelly! Yes, Erik? Were you expecting to meet "Oscar Braque"? As you tweeted when you arrived? No, that was metaphor. I meant writing it No harm from small publicity Leave the publicity to me Accompany "Rose Mary" to the top Delete the post Okay Wouldn't Oscar Brac watch the translation? This may be possible in these circumstances We each signed a non-disclosure agreement His true identity remains protected and safe He doesn't care much about the book's launch details the details? If I were "Oscar Barak", I 'd meet the people who hold my voice It comes to the quality of the text The quality of the book "Daedalus" is indisputable from Mrs. Corbel. He will come out soon. I am in the next room if you need anything I'd rather stick to the review only, that's what they're good at when they have nothing to do Well said. Completely very good Of course I did not read it. I am busy with more important things How? Yes, we'll talk about it It is not about "Daudelos" Of course, we will talk about it I'm so sorry Okay, see you later Take care of yourself, bye-bye What are you doing here? You introduced me, "Rose Mary". You wanted to see me? The rhythm of your translation is surprising, Mrs. Anisinova. Thank you Part Three Edition Concurrent with the opening of the book fair in "Paris" will be great I will organize a press conference Fans ... Fans will lose their mind If they see similar to "Rebecca" I prefer talking to them about my work We can do both Toast to Paris! Toast to Paris! Were it not for that fascination with "Oscar Braque" When someone smuggled the text As you know Ambiguity surrounding his identity And being the only person he knows It only brought me problems It is spread rumors He is one of the twins And another says that he is a woman She was a former spy in East Germany Some claimed that it was me Parfleur, Normandy, France. Excuse me I came for a lecture on general and comparative literature I gave up on education, young man I lived a lot of disappointments Excellent students prefer to enter the field of business To make money Instead of becoming struggling authors When one experiences hunger, art will not feed him how are you? Was your trip enjoyable? Long and boring This place no longer attracts customers Let them continue with that George, why don't you get rid of this place? You can spend the rest of your life traveling after all the money you've earned from copyright I have a great section on traveling Yes I know Finalizing "Daedalus" "The man who did not want to die" awaits you above - I knew that - of course Otherwise you wouldn't have come to visit me Oscar Braque is the only one Which I did not fully understand It belongs to the same class that we belong to Doesn't look like me I was never a fantasy what is wrong with you? - I thought you were going to die I wanted to experience the feeling of Rebecca while drowning You have strange methods as a translator I misunderstood you, Katrina. I am also a fan of "Daudelos". I was watching you I feel the same The last part is very touching Any writer who inspired Rebecca's soliloquy James Joyce Flood of consciousness It is trivial compared to "Molly Plus" In the "Iliad" What is the idea controlling the trilogy? Total knowledge Wrong, it's Rebecca. This is your interpretation of you - Learn to read - the hero ... Is frank Rebecca is the soul of the novel Frank's career in the novel is his realization that he did not have it Daedalus surpasses suspense It is a story of remorse و ؟نت؟ What affects you in "Daedalus"? I do not know Many things I love puzzles so much Didn't find the similarities to Joyce because you liked the puzzles? For me, it is a book that addresses sorrow Impossible grief I personally tested it "Angstrom" did not understand any of the cunning of the trilogy His method of promoting it is disgusting He might do anything to make money He will finally regret it I am glad to know you more Alex Goodman You have to give others a chance to get to know you more I understand why you did this Except for money, of course A translator lives by proxy A name nobody remembers Nobody prints your name on the cover You are... I set other targets And she had the power to achieve it You have always done well I gave you a chance I can give you one more chance But on one condition Tell me what I want to know Say something, damn it! Katrina is ready for tonight's match It will be a very important match Running and throwing the ball ... OUT! what are you doing here? Christmas is not a human hate I have always loved champagne You are a SII man Thank you for inviting me you are welcome I couldn't leave you with the manager. I am a caring man Come on, Italy! Sorry! - You're sorry Either you decide to play, or you pull out We are clearly not playing Italians only use their hands to speak Do you have more vulgar phrases? I love her so much! You are worse than us! It is better for you to stick to the flamingo dance No! Hey, this is in Spain. Things get mixed up, like everyone else You can mock me The Greeks have invented Wine, theater and democracy tried to overcome this It happened 3000 years ago It is true! You live on the glories of your history You also do not pay taxes I'm kidding I want to raise a toast I hope these three isolation weeks To refute the idea that brotherhood in the world is a figment of imagination I will repeat what is said in "Shakespeare" What the world needs now It is beautiful love do you know her? Yes It is the only thing that we are currently missing What the world needs now It is beautiful love Not only for some people, but for everyone What the world needs now It is beautiful love Why? Dear Erik ... What is going on here? The first ten pages of "Daedalus" part three, no longer belong to you Five million euros will stop the bleeding If not paid within 24 hours The next 100 pages will be published online tomorrow If you fail to pay, the entire book will be published Don't even think about it. pay the amount Enjoy the peace rejoice Because your unhappiness will delight thousands of fans of "Oscar Braque". Many have started translating his brilliant French To their mother tongue for fun only The Internet transcends cultural differences and unites people What the world needs now is beautiful love I heard that you have a beautiful lyrical voice We are on probation Sneak in this room We will stop the translation until further notice Without the last hundred pages the person is behind this crime He cannot fulfill his threat Until we find the culprit, you are all suspended And if you do not find it? Don't worry, Erik. We will find him, we will expose him Would you like to comment, Mr. Kedrinus? Excuse me, but if you don't pay the ransom right away You will get in big trouble No one will buy a book that has already published half of its pages for free Your order is over! Stop! you are crazy! Hassanً, destroyed Rose Mary, do something It can be handled very quickly The decision is up to you - How much did the hacker request? - Five million euros Call the police The leak was inside. Let me fix it I will find the paranoid and will eliminate it Or on it? Your hatred of women will destroy you This is not a phone Erik only knows the author and has the manuscript You are the only one in control and we don't know where you are This is the deal The panic dominates the sector and we have been sued by foreign publishers Come on, check everything out I’ll even help you The company relies on sales of the third part At this rate, we entered the loss phase Fix it, or we will go bankrupt Stop it! You bastard! Do not touch my things! Leave me! And what does Oscar Braque think? He doesn't know about it How is that? Regardless of everything, the culprit is here I will reveal his order within hours We will protect what is ours I must defend myself I am glad someone replied But people are very weak Look at yourself You are very angry, but don't you dare say a word If I did, I would lose my job So what? I love my job Do you like playing an affiliate role? No, I love literature Why don't you become a publisher then? I am not to blame if people are not ambitious What you are doing is very dangerous Nobody is above the law, neither you nor Angstrom. No, do not touch this! It's mine! You little fraudster, Mrs. Tuxin. This is not a manuscript from "Daedalus" Anyone who is fluent in the Danish language can confirm this Your writing style is sad I haven't finished it yet It is my first novel How long have you been writing it? Come on, tell me the truth 8 years But I felt inspired since I came here As you know... The contract prevents you from other activities During the translation period You have no idea about family life Isolation for two months is a golden opportunity to finish my novel Come on, Mrs. Tuxin. You have no talent Somewhere deep down It echoed you a small voice for years And I claimed that you do not hear it It is bad to delude yourself You will thank me one day what do you say? It's clearly a trap! Whoever blushes his face is inevitably guilty A true innocence is not ashamed of anything ... " Russo. Whoever it is, I respect it! If he needs help Let me know Bullshit! The intruder not only messes with "angstrom", but also messes with us Who gets the lowest wages here? - Because whoever steals the rich must be poor ... be realistic, Dario! Why should one be? Why isn't Rose Mary? Or the guards? Chefs? No They were not present in the bowling department They never heard my lyric Rose Mary was present I was taken to Angstrom. Rose Mary is a good girl She wouldn't think of a similar thing "Instagram" has to pay - He will never pay In any police novel, no one pays the first ransom money Rather, it is the beginning of problems The second ransom raises the tension, but no one pushes it Everyone collapses when claiming the third ransom and pays before it is too late "Mystery is a series of simple things" Daedalus, Part One, Chapter Four Exactly, we must think like an intruder She or he may have copied the text at some point when? We spent all of our time together, noting that this had happened During the night How did the criminal use the Internet? Perhaps one of them smuggled Disassembled smartphone to the shelter Great thing? Always carry it with him Remind me of how I broke your help I fell off my bike when? Yes, when? About a month ago - You lost your mind! He cannot claim pain. There is nothing inside If we stay together The hacker will not try to do anything I will not give you a drink Enough, Alex. I no longer believe that you are a playboy Don't let mistrust take control of you you are lying You are lying from the beginning I checked your order before I entered the shelter "Rebecca's sting" was not translated. Nor a "poisonous kiss". I'm in dire straits, Katrina. London, England. London City Police Well, I hear you We have not managed to get him to speak and he wants to speak to "Oscar Braque" only Does he want to get paid for his illegal translation? Just give me the papers and let's get it done Are you sure you want to sue him? Claiming a fan is bad advertising for Daedalus You play a dangerous game, young man In France, copyright infringement puts you in prison for five years If you are successful, a fine of 300,000 euros In England, the fine may be doubled and everyone knows that I have a hard heart Did you offer my translation to "Oscar Braque"? It's better than your translations and fans prefer to translate The real fan buys the translation and does not steal it Real fans uploaded my translation 10 million times in less than two weeks What did your business achieve? You think you are smart, don't you? But this did not prevent you from being exposed Maybe I wanted my order to be exposed You will never meet Oscar Braque Even if he shows interest in you, I will not do this service for you Hiring me to translate the third part - Officially - You make fun of us - In honor of "Oscar Braque" - We have previously chosen an English translator Aaron Troyes is a bad translator The role of the translator will not help you meet "Oscar Braque" This will not harm me in anything You will win a lot and nothing will be lost I will work for free I know his business better than anyone - By God, you have to. - Well, that's enough Take him back to the dungeon I bet you can predict the first sentence of Part Three Easily What did he say? Afraid to hit my prognosis? Can you please leave us alone? Let's go Come on Impress me how did you know her? The first sentence of the second part Made up of the first words for each chapter of the first part I adopted Oscar Brack's logic. And I assumed that he would use the second part to write the first sentence of the third part just awesome I wish I spoiled it "Angstrom" is convinced that I am now intruder I might do anything to meet Oscar Braque. But I wouldn't have used it for money I can't cheat on him I had already betrayed him when I translated the first and second parts The translation into English mirrored "Angstrom". Fast and shallow Readers posted a petition online Required to replace the translator If we do not find the culprit My order will end I almost stole the manuscript I couldn't wait I wanted to know the end Do you know where Angstrom has in store? He takes his bag with him wherever he goes And the secret code? 123 is the most common With 321 ‫567 ‫765 666, The Devil's Number 911, September 11 incident 365, number of days of the year 069, sexual position ‫007 777, the sacred number 3 times It is the most common triple secret symbols in the world Daedalus, Part One, Chapter 15 For Angstrom, he chose the sexual position number You will leave for London in an hour Bring it to me Anything you can find about Alex Goodman Show me that you love literature Yes, definitely, we should not waste time Erik? I am in Mr. Goodman's apartment and I have not found anything to condemn. Sorry But something disturbed me during my trip here Three translators have climbed to the top since their arrival They were able to use the Internet at the time I watched Mr. Varelli and Mrs. Tuxin well But not Mrs. Anisinova. Millions carried the first ten pages of Daedelus. here we are We will know in a while Let's see who among you cannot stand this situation Come on Try to send me an email now Dear eric I thought you were smarter than that An additional 100 newspapers are now published online 20 million euros will save the rest for you I overused my generosity You have 6 hours Before losing more pages It is time to make the right decision and rely on your good knowledge He who blushes blush is the culprit Honest innocence Don't be shy about anything What if? "Ingrid" became the guilty one? Yes, I said that It turned into evil sorcery There is no magic Daedalus, Part Two Chapter ten I memorized all the pages of Part Three This is your trick, isn't it? Excuse me? Do not claim innocence You're playing Rebecca. Beat others with your work I did the impossible To attract my interest To invite you to my office I had not previously planned All you do is premeditated She is guilty This is a clear Divide and conquer, right? We protect what is ours! No, enough! I will not be held here because of you You mean! What do you do? stop now! Alex, no! leave it! Get away from me! I know you are guilty I know I will prove it You will see Unless the guilty admits, you will not get anything from me Will you let us die from hunger? watch me Things will be fine No, you will not be okay No water, no heating No food! Try to be tactful Calm down, Javier. The worst is over Gorgeous! - Are you okay, Javier? - What is the reason for the blackout? - They mess with us - Lights! Are you fine? We should get out of here Do you have someone waiting for you outside? My dog ​​maybe my lovers However They can enjoy their life without me My daughter It is becoming adult now In fact, I haven't seen her for months We became like two strangers Don't worry, Helen. Look at the bright side Your husband and children love you On the reverse I You don't mean that On the contrary, the situation is shocking I don't think my vision was as clear as today Since I got here, I realized ... Despite all my attempts to persuade myself to the contrary I don't miss them None of them, not even the child I feel that they are They were just ideas for me All I wanted in my youth It is to write novels And to see the world I did not want to have children But Carl insisted on having children I slapped him to please him This is what I always do To please everyone first In fact, that's what made me write That the happiest people But I was afraid to write While I was getting angry On my husband and children because they took my time And my creative space I put the blame on them because I'm only localized I am not a writer worthy of this title I refused to admit it to myself Even with moving away from them I am not able to write But by convincing myself that I am able I lost on all levels You flatter me I put on a mask from the start and I was fooled by you You and I belong to the cold blood give me a chance give me a chance I beg you! Well done I beg you" Magic word It wasn't difficult, was it? For someone who lacks imagination, tell your story in a good way All I told you is the truth We have to make sure of it I have omitted to mention a small detail You are imprisoned no Me I will skip the trial. I am innocent It was self-defense "Whoever blushes with shame is the culprit A true innocence is not ashamed of anything. But what do you want? I have always been clear To meet Oscar Braque. If i were you I would have tried to persuade him to meet me "Knowledge springs from pages" "Knowledge springs from pages" if? If you can choose translators To work in the shelter before October I may start printing the book in February I found a very guarded place Global release date ... Wait, Erik. You will ask me to slow down to benefit financially Always the same story And I tell you that everything is excellent And I'm right I will not work with you anymore Excuse me? I will meet another publishing house next week I hope you're kidding I have not signed an exclusive contract with you Well, I'm going to add a million to the first batch I will multiply you copyright earnings, will this satisfy you? I will return to you the first payment It is not about money What if? Fulfillment لنفسي What about your loyalty to me? I always respected Your desire to keep your name anonymous and struggled to perpetuate the reputation of "Oscar Braque" In spite of the many skeptics, how do you give me the favor? Do you know how much we invested in this book? We should go this year We need it badly Spend the night here Read it quietly I want to be the first to know the end This is a great honor! Screw you! Nothing satisfies you Nothing has changed since university When I came to see you Angstrom was a humble publishing house You are proud to publish it for any book you choose But your marketing plan for Daedalus seemed to be promoting toothpaste To increase the percentage of profits Money has blinded your insight Success is not a dirty idea If I were able to write Erik, you understand me. You can't do this to me You want to isolate the translators Inside a shelter and treat them like cattle? You have lost your sense of humanity And with a creative sense what are you doing? I am working Everyone seems to have forgotten why we are here Books are my refuge too "Searching for lost time" Do you know why I'm trying to resemble "Rebecca"? It is a protective shield I feel invincible It is strange that you derive your strength from the victim Not the victim On the contrary, she was killed because of her influence The first sentence of the third part It is not composed of the first word of each chapter of the second part you lied to me You're the sneaker. - Stop, Katrina. - I will never harm you - I do not know you I am a fan of "Daedalus" I did not lie to you about the basic things Don't you want to know Oscar Braque? If he wants to keep his name secret, I will respect his wish I don't know what your story is But inevitably something happened to you She became one of his book characters Be able to express your torment Only he can understand you What will you tell him when you first meet him? nothing When we are in the presence of "Oscar Braque" We leave the floor to him I want to be with you I came to give you a lesson in magic What made you change your mind? I felt sorry for you yesterday Screw you What is the Frank Hardy Gold Rule? "Always look in the right direction." Which corresponds a lot to the sinking of Rebecca. If he had gone to the ship's starboard that night, he would have saved it I know the story well, thanks So this is what he is trying to do during the investigation To look in the right direction if? Your fault It is your insistence on thinking that everything happened in the shelter I expected the events But this does not show how I got the manuscript - He was always with me - I know I also know that you are as accurate as the watch Leave the "Angstrom" publishing house Every evening, forty-seven minutes Every evening, you go straight home She sits in the same seat every time In the middle car of the subway And disappear in the crowd Every day at the same time There are 13 stations from "Glacier" to "Pacy". The time is between any two stations on line 6 It is accurate and 18 seconds This makes your flight 15 minutes and 36 seconds One week before we entered the shelter You got up without knowing On your trip with an empty bag You had replaced it with your other bag Quick Copy - Good evening. - Good evening ‫666 No - 911 - No - 365 Come on! No! ‫069 Time out of us Come on! ‫007 Come on - We're over ! - Shut up! ‫777 I opened it! Risu machine, JD 7630 It is the best among its counterparts Copies 170 pages per minute And using two machines Copying the manuscript takes 1 minute and 36 seconds Copy 480 pages From the third part of "Daedalus" Do you realize the risks? the prison But you are in prison, Ingrid, all of you Obaid system trifle Persecuting those who need them And your intelligence prevents you from submitting to it Freedom is an abstract concept in my country Are you watching your translation yourself? Or monitored by a committee? Commission, I have learned anticipation People like "Angstrom" make deals to take over the market They are criminals Do not get any percentage of the sale Yet there are 500 million people who speak your language in the world Do you consider this fair? - I don't have the choice - the option is always there You must enjoy being treated Dirty treatment Do not ridicule me! Concept? The positive of the matter is that no one will suspect you I'm the opportunity of your life, Javier. You choose the craziest thing And the smartest And the most persecuted The bravest Why should I trust you? I am not a beginner Excuse me! "The man who did not want to die" Wait, Chen! Get out of the way! Oh my God! Watch out! You bastard! Give way! Destroyer Lazy! Well, we're done! Alex! Damn! Bear Hakim. Who helped you? From? I told you how it happened But I will not tell you who The magician does not reveal all trick This is what you think We will catch them somehow This is just your opinion Do you think the boy is able to blackmail millions? He will never tell us about the bunker "Crime is a form of theater." Daedalus, Part One, Chapter Nine You are worse than me thank you sir Horses and birds Pigs, I have no problem but rats! Where did you learn to drive like this? - Do not want to know Do you have a driver's license? I touched it I touched a rat I was scared so much. I hate rats Shut up! Who wants to read it first? You are first, sir Nobody will be blessed with this opportunity, we will read it aloud Gorgeous! Who wants to start? I do not want - We stayed here forever Do you mind if I start? Come on, you are so excited Oscar Braque the third part Daedalus "The man who did not want to die" Isolation for three weeks It refutes the idea that brotherhood in the world is a figment of imagination As it is said in the language "Shakespeare" What the world needs now is love Why not seek it? from the beginning What is the melody? What the world needs now ... It is true! Needs beautiful love Come on, let's get together Is this good? Help! Help! I knew that she would be exposed I don't think Mrs. Tuxin is smart enough to be an intruder Or donate anything else But she was able to face the facts It's over, Erik. Your partners will come to get us out of here When they discover Helen’s death They should know about it first it's cold here It will help save the body Yes? Nobody leaves the library! My condolences to you - Did I wake you up? - Say what you have, Rose Mary. Nothing suspects the apartment Except for a small detail I did not find bathroom tools Not even a bar of soap It is unoccupied I asked the neighbors and none of them saw "Goodman" It is the desired One does not need coverage when he has nothing to hide Where does he actually live? I do not know... Do something you idiot! Do the impossible and find his hideout Concept? Not tired? I hope Angstrom pays you overtime If you want to rest, let's find a secluded place He knows that I'm a master of massage What? We may not get out of here alive Why not take advantage of the remaining time? Chen! Erik knows ... He knows Knows what? That we are concerned It makes us pay the price from the start When I fell His pen had fallen off From the bag What are you talking about? He must have noticed it Listen... We must keep our cool what's going on? Is enough! It has gone too far! I understand how you feel But was "Helen" will commit suicide once and elsewhere I am not sure of that I prefer prison entry to stay one second here Javier Are you an intruder? I asked you a question You are an intruder Dear Erik ... I didn't know you had a self-destructive tendency She lost 200 additional pages forever 80 million euros is the price of your punishment You have 20 minutes Before you lose the whole book forever Do the right thing We protect What is ours Tell me how to stop this leak Otherwise, I killed you all! It is a remote system that sends messages on specific dates and times If you kill me now You can deposit the third part forever Want to play games? Let's start playing! I will start with the country with little payoff It has nothing to do with it, the matter between you and me It's too late for that Kill me, bastard! This will comfort me We must do something Stutter in French He does not understand anything Let's organize and resist - What do we do? Let's split into two teams The first team distracts the guards The second team breaks it They are planning something. I understand some Spanish words You have to understand everything, you idiot! I am next to you Damn! I am not fluent in Spanish I'm good at it Complete the conversation and I will translate Stop now! We can stop everything now Decision is yours Oh really? What do you suggest?
