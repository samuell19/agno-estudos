What is a true American treasure? Dizzy Gillespie's trumpet. Abraham Lincoln's hat. Tito Puente's drums. George Washington's coat. A gown that Jackie Kennedy wore. Babe Ruth's signed baseball. The Muhammad Ali gloves. R2D2 and CP3O. These objects seem to have little in common. But they all represent the rich diversity of U.S. history: Dramatic events... Life-changing discoveries... Remarkable inventions... Legendary people. Curators at the Smithsonian's national museum of American history have taken on a from the museum's three million artifacts, chose a group of objects that most define the American experience. It's really a concentrated, powerful experience to be in the presence of all of these great things at once. For the first time ever, these national treasures can be seen in one place, and share one amazing story. It really is this wonderful snapshot of who we are, of American identity, of what the nation is. It's 200 years of history as you've never seen it before through America's treasures. Washington, D.C., home to monuments honoring the great events, people and ideals that have shaped America's history. But our history is more than stories cast in marble and stone. At the Smithsonian's national museum of American history, the American experience comes to life. The museum of American history has a unique mission. This is the only museum in the world that has the mission of telling the whole story of American history. Over the decades, the museum has amassed a collection of over three million objects from the past. A treasure trove so vast, most pieces are rarely displayed. In 2006, the museum closed its doors for a major two-year renovation. But its curators took on a special mission. Find among the museum's greatest pieces, a new way to experience America's past. And it's all here in the "treasures of American history." The vision for the exhibition was to remind people that American history is a story, a series of stories that includes amazing accomplishments, legendary individuals, challenging milestones and defining moments of American history, as well as extraordinary diversity. Curators Katy Kendrick and Peter Liebhold spearheaded the selections for the exhibition. Here in the museum, treasure is really about the story that something that can, and that's where the true value really resides. The idea of doing a treasures exhibit was both really exciting and also, really daunting. The chance to go into the storage rooms, to find the hidden corners and the cabinets where there are things that hadn't been exhibited in years, or even ever, and to learn from the curators themselves what objects they knew about, and that they felt were treasures. The ones in the front row here. Peter and Katy decided to include objects that represent both America's triumphs... And her tragedies. We always celebrate our past. Then it looks easy if we understand where we sometimes stumbled, we are better equipped to answer the challenges of the future. In all, 150 treasures, all icons, were chosen, representing the exhibition's basic themes; the nation's challenges, our most influential people. But first, the country's spirit of creativity and innovation, the story of America. Creativity innovation is very fundamentally an American trait. We tell the story of innovation and industrial scene. But we also talk about how daily life has been fundamentally changed through innovation and creativity. It's impossible to imagine the story of American innovation without one man, Thomas Edison. Despite little formal schooling, his work would make him a star. In 1878, Edison is already famous the world over as the man who can make a machine talk. He's invented the phonograph and that's made his reputation. And so after this, he's kind of thinking about, okay, what can I do next. Choosing one object to represent Edison's genius is difficult. But out of his record 1,093 patents, only one is the literal definition of a bright idea... The electric light bulb. This is one of the few surviving bulbs from Edison's first public demonstration of his most famous invention. December 31st, 1879, Edison prepares to go public with his latest bulb, much to the relief of his investors. He invites the world to a demonstration at his lab in menlo park. Special trains were run out from New York to bring, not just the investors, but, you know, various people who were interested, because Edison was a celebrity. He lit the lab, he lit the office, he lit the grounds, and he lit Sarah Jordan's boarding house, across the street with 60 or 70 of the new light bulbs. This demonstration was significant in that it was the application that got people to wire their homes, to wire their businesses, to wire their schools and factories. And this is what ordinary people began to see as a way to use this wondrous new force. The national museum of American history has collected hundreds of Edison's bulbs. But the true treasure is the bulb from the night Thomas Edison turned on the lights for America. Edison felt vindicated by this demonstration. It just solidified his reputation. And here's the man who can bring light to the masses, and indeed that's how he was portrayed for most of the rest of his life. While Edison help light up streets, homes and businesses, another 19th century invention shed light on how Americans saw themselves. George eastman's Kodak camera of 1888 is a small hand-held box. It was the first hand-held snapshot camera, and George eastman was able to revolutionize the field of photography. Suddenly, picture-taking became convenient and easy. Everything was done for you by Kodak. So you'd buy a camera for $25, and it would be fully loaded with a hundred images. So you could take those hundred images. When you were finished, you would send it back to Rochester to the eastman-Kodak company. They would print your negatives, you would get your prints returned to you, along with the negatives, and for ten dollars, it was all done. In today's money, that's over 200 dollars. Not cheap, but it was a hit. Perhaps no art form has dominated American culture more than moving pictures. So choosing one movie to represent nearly a hundred years of Hollywood was a challenge. Curators settled on a timeless favorite. Oh! One, two, three. There's no place like home. There's no place like home. There's no place like home. There's no place like home. There's no place like home. "The wizard of oz" premiered in 1939, leading audiences through an imaginary world of vivid technicolor. It was a film that, as a creative masterpiece, combines the new technology of technicolor with the execution of really an innovative and wonderful story. Toto, I have a feeling we're not in Kansas any more. The Ruby slippers, worn by Judy Garland's character, Dorothy, are instantly recognizable. Today, they're among the most popular objects in the museum's collection. They are priceless shoes. The joy of the Ruby slippers is that they remain a real icon in American culture that have power well beyond the shoes, well beyond their display, well beyond the film. And can anyone imagine Dorothy's slippers in any other color? But originally, they weren't supposed to be red. In frank baum's book, the basis for the movie, the slippers are actually silver, and they stayed that way through an early draft of the screenplay. But the producers felt silver wasn't dramatic enough for technicolor. So, the slippers' seemingly perfect color choice was actually a last minute change. Because the film had to connote fantasy, the shoes had to have an inner power, and that Ruby glow was what made them have that. Yet all those years in the spotlight would take the sparkle out of anything, even Ruby slippers. Deep in the basement of the museum in an area off limits to visitors, is the objects conservation lab. Conservator Beth Richwine has the delicate task of getting America's treasures ready for display. Well, I'm cleaning the Ruby slippers and I've had to do some tests to figure out what I can clean them with. They're actually very faded because they've been on exhibit for many, many years. So I'm hoping some of the dirt removal will brighten them up. Chemical tests on the slippers reveal that the sequins are made of gelatin, an organic substance easily damaged by most cleaning solvents. So Beth must use a small bit of cotton dipped in ice water to clean them. It's a painstaking job done one sequin at a time. At first, you think, oh wow, the Ruby slippers, and no one else gets to touch these. But once you start on it and you start doing the task, it's really... it's all about the materials and how they're going to react. Then you're concerned about that sort of thing and not so much, you know, distracted by the glitz of what they actually are. Beth's job can be a little like a forensic detective's. Using a hand-held microscope, she uncovers the secret behind the sparkle. And as I move this over the shoe, you can see in an area like this, that there's like a netting underneath the sequins. And it was just a normal shoe and they put the netting over it to allow them to stitch the sequins into the piece. From the beginnings of colored film to the birth of the blockbuster, innovations in movie making have had an enormous impact on popular culture. At first glance, the next objects representing innovation seem humble in comparison. But half a century ago, they held the power to save thousands of lives. These tiny bottles contained a vaccine to prevent polio, a virus that put fear into the heart of every parent. It struck infants and children without warning, often causing lifelong paralysis, or death. For most of the twentieth century before aids came on the scene, polio was the most famous, or infamous disease in the country, because it caused paralysis, mostly in children. That trauma is what made it so fearful and so famous. In 1952, the worst polio outbreak in U.S. history struck nearly 58,000 American children. Over a third were left with some form of paralysis, losing the use of their limbs, or even their lungs, for life. Five percent of the victims died. Then, two years later, one man found hope. There were hundreds of researchers who worked on the problem of how to create a vaccine for polio. And then, Salk comes on the scene and figures out a way to create a vaccine that is safe, potent and effective. In 1954, Dr. Jonas Salk oversaw a clinical trial of his vaccine. At 215 test sites, 1.8 million school children lined up for shots. These vaccine bottles and syringe were used by Dr. Salk himself to vaccinate children during the test. They took blood from all the kids and then analyzed all the data and then announced that, sure enough, the vaccine worked. It was, I think, like 80 percent, 75 percent effective. Church bells rang, mothers cried and hugged their children, and Jonas Salk became an overnight celebrity. He was a hero. He was on TV and radio. He got thousands and thousands of letters of "thank you" within days because it was such a major event. So, this tiny little vial and this small syringe were part of such a monumental event in history. The Salk polio vaccine was not only a medical innovation, it was a dramatic response to a national challenge. And there had been many others in the two centuries since the nation's founding. Every American needs to understand that there have been challenges in the past, and that there are no simple answers to those challenges. So these objects remind us of the struggles that we've been through and they can also provide inspiration for dealing with struggles that we face now. An obvious starting point is the challenge that began in 1776, the founding of a nation. It's a story with no shortage of famous artifacts. But one of the most significant, maybe the least known... A small wooden box that helped launch one of the great turning points in history. Jefferson's writing table was the table on which he wrote the declaration of independence. And this is a very significant, if not the most significant object in our collection. Jefferson was doing a lot of traveling at the time of the declaration of independence was about to be written, between monticello, his home in Virginia, and Philadelphia, where the continental congress was meeting. And so, one of the things he thought would be to have this portable writing desk that he could take with him on his travels. Thomas Jefferson, on the order of the continental congress in Philadelphia, was commissioned to write the declaration on June 11th, 1776. Those famous words we all know so well, or do we? Can you recite any part of the declaration of independence? Oh. Um... Oh my god. We the people. We the people in order to form a more perfect union. We the people of the united states in order to form a more perfect union establish justice, ensure domestic tranquility. When in the course of human events... We might struggle with the words, but we'll never forget the meaning. Jefferson drafted parts of the declaration on this very desk. And on July 4th, 1776, the American colonies proclaimed their freedom from British rule. It's such a wonderful moment in history. The formation of the ideals of the country, the drafting of the declaration of independence, the coming together of a bunch of people to determine what stands to this very day. Jefferson knew America would cherish the desk upon which the declaration was drafted. And so, attached a note to it, one rarely, if ever, seen by the public. Unfortunately, we can't display it upside down in the exhibit. So it's kind of a hidden treasure of this object. That there is this note attached to the bottom in Jefferson's own handwriting in which he says... "Politics as "well as religion" has its superstitions. "These gaining strength with "time may one day give imaginary "value to this relic for its "association with the birth of "the great charter of our independence." So it's a nice kind of glimpse into Jefferson's personality that knowing that Americans would have this hunger for history. A personal note from the founding father adds a rare touch to an American treasure. But Jefferson's words were just the first salvo in a struggle that would be settled at gunpoint. Far from public view, one special room holds an extraordinary collection of historical firepower. It's kind of fun coming in here in what would be a room full of guns, everyday. Curator David Miller is the keeper of the museum's gun room, officially known as the national firearms collection. It's the most comprehensive assortment of historical firearms in America. From military firearms used today to a hand cannon dating from the 15th century. In one row alone, there are racks of muskets, a drawer full of civil war era percussion revolvers, and even the mother of all Swiss army knives. It has over a hundred blades on it, and they include a revolver, a straight razor, and even miniature blades and scissors. From this 7,000-piece collection, curators chose just three for the exhibition, the Colt Patterson revolver of 1839, a rare revolver used by a confederate officer, and a rifle presented to president Abraham Lincoln. The 1839 Colt Patterson revolver is known as "the gun that won the west" thanks to an ingenious innovation. It's a five-shot 36-caliber revolver. At the time it was developed and invented, most pistols only fired one shot at a time, and you had to reload them. This one has a cylinder that contains five charges, so you can get out five shots without reloading. A very effective weapon for the times. The next treasure is as famous for its owner as its innovation. This 45-caliber six-shot revolver once belonged to confederate leader Jeb Stuart. This is a double-action revolver. That means by pulling the trigger, you cock the piece, rotate the cylinder, and fire the revolver all with one pull. And this was favored by the cavalry men who had to ride with their left hand and shoot with their right hand. The third treasure is a remarkable rifle. But it's remembered more as a present to a president. This is a Henry rifle that was presented to Abraham Lincoln in 1862, from the new haven firearms manufacturing company. The company presented it to Lincoln in hopes that it would influence the war department into purchasing the Henry for the military. It's gold plated and ornately engraved, and it has a cartouche here that says, "Lincoln, president u.S.A." But the gift didn't convince Lincoln to buy any for his army. His military leaders felt "the Henry" was too delicate for harsh battlefield conditions. Abraham Lincoln, himself, could be called a national treasure. The man who freed the slaves and saved the union gets his own tribute in the treasures exhibition with a simple item that evokes both his stature and his tragic end. It's unassuming and worn by time, but instantly recognizable. This was not the only top hat Lincoln owned. But it's the last one he ever wore. Ten P.M., April 14th, 1865. During a performance at Ford's theater, John Wilkes booth steps into the presidential box, aims his pistol, and shoots Lincoln in the back of the head. Nine hours later, the president is dead. From that tragic night, many objects have survived. It was a crime scene and many things were gathered up by the war department for a potential investigation. The top hat was among the artifacts transferred to the Smithsonian nearly two years after Lincoln's death. But the institution secretary considered it too ghoulish for public view, and the hat was banished to the basement. No one was allowed to talk about it. No one was allowed to see it. It really didn't exist. Lincoln's hat was first displayed about 30 years after the fact. And by that time, the event had ceased to be as morbid as they were, and they had become much more historical. The hat is this different way of seeing Lincoln, because on the one hand, it is an icon of his public image. But yet, when you actually look at this hat, and it's maybe smaller than you might expect, and it's old, and it's faded. But it also has an individual character. It really humanizes Lincoln. He was a real man. He was a real person, and that connection is what objects can give us, and that's what the Lincoln hat does. Lincoln's hat, Jefferson's desk, and a gun that changed the west. Small artifacts that crystallize moments in challenging times. Less than a century after Lincoln, America was in a life and death global struggle, world war ii. On d-day, June 6th, 1944, American troops took part in the largest seaborne invasion in history. The museum's curators looked for a way to capture this pivotal moment and found it in the work of one man. Robert capa was a magazine photographer, contracting with life magazine, at the time of world war ii. And he was one of two magazine photographers who were able to go in on the d-day invasion. Capa went in on the USS chase with about 2,000 gi soldiers, Americans, and did the same thing that they did. The Robert capa photograph of d-day shows the gis launching off the barges and jumping into the water, which he had to do himself. So you see their backs, and you see them blurred because he's in action just like they are. And Germans had put obstacles in their way. So they're jumping, they're moving, they're swimming. And he was scared. Capa conquered his fear long enough to shoot several rolls. His film survived the bloody battle. But later, a terrible mistake nearly destroyed it all. He got about three rolls of film, 72 images or so, and the film was rushed back to the London offices of life magazine. Everyone was so excited to get that film back that the technician rushed through the job. And when the negatives, the films were drying, he turned up the heat to have it done quicker, and the emulsion melted, and they lost almost all of capa's photographs. Only eleven survived, of which our museum has nine. Two weeks after the invasion, Robert capa's highly anticipated images appeared in life magazine. They are now among the most famous photos of world war ii. Capa's adage that if your pictures aren't good enough, you're not close enough, is certainly born out in this image. He was there. He was in the thick of it. And those images he brought back are arresting and compelling, and they really do just connect you to this moment that's engrained in our popular memory. Less than two decades later, Americans faced another national challenge, another fight for freedom, but this time, on home soil. Explosive demonstrations rock the north as well as the south, as negroes struggled for equal opportunities. The objects in this scene could be from any town's corner drugstore. But they symbolize the battle for equal rights in the segregated south. On February 1st, 1960, in Greensboro, North Carolina, four black university students did the unthinkable. They sat down at a "whites only" woolworth's lunch counter. They were denied service and were asked to leave. They continued to sit in at this lunch counter at woolworth's for the next six months. It was a courageous act in direct defiance of segregation, and led to other sit-ins across the south. This is the actual counter where those four students first took a stand. After that first day, many more joined them, risking arrest, injury and retaliation. Six months later, on July 25th, woolworth's gave in and served its first African-American customer. After a week, they had served hundreds more. The Greensboro student sit-ins inspired non-violent protests in other states, eventually leading to the desegregation of restaurants, theaters and concert halls throughout the south. The lunch counter is a very powerful symbol of the civil rights movement. Many people who come to the museum instantly understand the significance. The lunch counter honors a moment in history and a triumph for equal rights. Another treasure, this wheelchair, honors a man who fought another form of discrimination. It's custom built to be operated with only one finger, and its driver, Ed Roberts, became a leader in the struggle for disability rights. He helped ignite a movement. He not only changed how society viewed people with disabilities, but he also helped people with disabilities change the way they viewed themselves. When he was 14 years old, Ed contracted the polio virus that plagued the nation. Though unable to move, he still dreamed of going to college... Although most universities did not accommodate people with severe disabilities. But Roberts decided to fight for acceptance, and in 1962, he won the right to attend the University of California at Berkeley. The first thing that Ed really cut his activist teeth on was, in a sense, integrating Berkeley for people with disabilities. He and a couple other guys called themselves "the rolling quads." Roberts went on to earn two masters degrees, and decided to spend his life helping others with disabilities. He started a global movement to teach independent living to people with disabilities... And to advocate for the civil rights of disabled people. He was instrumental in explaining the importance of access and ramps, and thinking about people whose bodies are different. But he also was a great leader for people with disabilities to show that you can still achieve all that meets your own potential wherever you are, whoever you are. In struggling to assert his rights and his abilities, Ed Roberts really became a role model to thousands of people with disabilities around the world. Ed Roberts is just one example of how a single individual can provoke powerful change. The treasures exhibition created a whole category to explore the personalities that helped shape American history. American biography really gives us the opportunity to show off some of the famous objects in our collection that tell the stories of celebrated individuals, that give new glimpses into their personalities, and also symbolize the achievements and what they accomplished. But in all of American history, whose story should be told first? Who, for you, is the most recognizable person in American history? If I had to pick one, I'd say Lincoln. John F. Kennedy. Ben Franklin. Martin Luther King, junior. Abraham Lincoln. I would say George Washington. I'll probably say George Washington. George Washington. George Washington is probably still the most famous American. Whenever there are surveys taken about recognizable figures in American history, George Washington always comes out number one. With his face on the dollar bill, Washington is part of everyday life. Even in his own time, he was a celebrity, the first military commander-in-chief, first president of a newly minted country. George Washington is so engrained in the public mind that even his clothes seem familiar. Washington knew that clothes made the man, and chose his carefully. The general officer's uniform reflects the style he wore to official functions when he wanted to emphasize his role as commander-in-chief. But Washington didn't have to rely on clothing alone to command attention. He was over six feet tall, and it was something that was commented on by his contemporaries that you just saw this man and you sensed he was a leader. He carried himself very regally, very impressively. George Washington was the first of many famous presidents. But when it comes to first ladies, one stands out as an icon. In the 1960 presidential election, the country voted for Jack, but fell in love with Jackie. On route to their new address, 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, John and Jacqueline Kennedy are cheered by nearly a million. Everyone wanted to know what the fashionable young first lady would wear to the inaugural ball. Jackie Kennedy didn't disappoint. It was a very slim dress. It's a sheath rather than a big bouffanty skirt, it's made of silk, a very shear silk called peau d'ange. The bodice of the dress is embroidered with silver and brilliance or crystals. And then that is covered by an over a blouse of chiffon. So it really gave people just a hint as she was passing by that there was something shimmering underneath. And the gown was worn with a matching cape, also made of silk. The gown was an instant success and American women had a new icon. The thing about Jackie Kennedy is, it was what she wore, but it was also how she wore it, the poise, the elegance, and the glamour that she just radiated. And a lot of her clothes are fairly simple and understated. So it was much more than the design itself, but the overall "Jackie look" that women, especially, really gravitated towards and wanted to emulate. First ladies occupied this unique place in American society. They're public figures, but they're also expected to be private in the sense that they're wives and mothers. Jackie Kennedy really did redefine that, and it's definitely made her much more than a first lady. She is an icon, and remains to this day. Not all of the influential figures that have touched American lives are actual people. In fact, one famous figure that has influenced the American identity isn't human at all. It's a toy. My favorite childhood toy was the television. The slinky. Lite-brite. I had a rocket ship. My marbles. Probably legos. Elmo. Gi Joe's. I'd probably just say my Barbies. I loved Barbie. Barbie. * Barbie you're beautiful... * you make me feel... * my Barbie doll is really real... * Barbie debuted in 1959 in New York City. She became an instant bestseller for the mattel toy company. But not everyone was enamored with the new doll. Barbie has gotten her share of criticism. When she first came out, there were some people who felt she was a little sleazy, almost. Barbie's anatomy had generated controversy over the years. Some critics claimed that a real women with Barbie's measurements would stand over seven feet tall, while weighing under 130 pounds. But Barbie still sells. Worldwide, two dolls are sold every second. And almost 50 years later, she has become a 1.9 billion dollar a year industry for mattel. * my Barbie doll is really real... * * Barbie doll is really real... America's treasures not only includes Barbie's toy story, but also the real-life one-two punch of one of the greatest legends in sports. Who's the greatest? You are! Who's the prettiest? You are! Muhammad Ali was a young boxer that transcended his sport and became famous throughout the world for his actions both in and outside the ring. These were his trademark tools. Three-time world heavyweight boxing champion, the sportsman of the century, and a humanitarian crusader, Muhammad Ali is one of the most prominent Americans living today. He has one of the most famous faces in the world. And we've got his gloves. That definitely says a lot. Ali's rise to boxing glory began in 1964 when, as Cassius Clay, he won his first heavyweight title against champion, Sonny liston. Soon after, he converted to islam and took the name Muhammad Ali. He often drew criticism for his religious beliefs and social statements. One of the defining moments for Muhammad Ali's career and his life came about in 1966 during the Vietnam war when was notified that he was eligible for the draft. And he had recently converted to islam, and he did not want to go to fight in the Vietnam war. And he made a statement as such saying, "I ain't got not quarrel with them Vietcong." and he held his convictions that he should not be forced to go off and fight for a government that oppressed his own people at home, let alone against a people with whom, as he said, he had no quarrel, no problem. Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Muhammad Ali has just refused to be inducted into the United States armed forces. Ali's convictions would cost him his heavyweight crown. The boxing commission stripped him of his title, they banned him from boxing, and he was prosecuted as a draft dodger. So that moment really crystallized his importance, not just as a sports hero, but as a cultural icon, as an inspiration to other folks who felt powerless. In 1970, he was allowed to return to the ring. Ultimately, the supreme court validated him and upheld his claim that he was, in fact, a conscientious objector. But he had lost everything in that time. In 1974, Ali regained his heavyweight title by beating George Foreman in Zaire in the famous fight known as "the rumble in the jungle." * I'm the one, the ace, the only * * I'm the king then in 1975, Ali defended his title against Joe Frazier in "the thrilla in Manilla." In "the thrilla in Manilla" fight we do know that he wore red gloves. Whether these are the gloves, I think Ali would have liked us to think that they were. But we don't say for sure. The gloves not only represent Ali's skill inside the ring, but also his determination to stand up for his beliefs outside it. * oh yeah! Another great American also followed his conscience. The symbol of his fight, this simple hoe. It caused thousands of workers to suffer and its owner fought to ban its use. This is a short-handle hoe. It's really interesting because it's more than just an agricultural implement. It's a symbol of oppression and the symbol ultimately of achievement. The hoe was used by the family of activist, Cesar Chavez. If they're not working, they should have the right as any other working American... He was the firsthand witness to the terrible plight of migrant farm workers and labored to improve their circumstances. His family and thousands of other migrant workers toiled for unbearably long days, were paid low wages, and worked under painfully harsh conditions. Cesar Chavez is a very significant person in terms of American history. He historically transcends his experience as an organizer of the united farm workers and moves onto being one of the nation's most important civil rights leaders, and an icon of the latino community. Because of his amazing leadership qualities, his ability to lead and also organize, he's become an almost mythic figure. When Cesar was young, his family lost their farm and they were forced to join the ranks of migrant workers. He never forgot the short-handled hoe and its backbreaking lesson. So the fact that the family saved this hoe says that it really had a lot of meanings to them as far as a reminder of their own history and also the struggle that the farm workers were waging against the working conditions. Absolutely. I think the hoe is really significant to the family, significant to many agricultural workers. The short-handled hoe, you have to stoop over. You have to bend right down, almost be on the ground. Growers claimed that it made them more accurate. But most people think it was really just a symbol of oppression that it showed who was in control. It was finally made illegal. Chavez organized the farm workers into a union in 1962. He eventually helped to make the short-handle hoe illegal. Under his leadership, the united farm workers became a political force, inspiring further latino activism. The treasures exhibition also houses the jacket that Chavez once wore at rallies, strikes and work sites. The life of Cesar Chavez shows how a single individual can foster change that affects millions of people, transforming a nation, and in turbulent times, he did it without violence. America's treasures range from the delicate glass of Edison's genius... to a favorite toy, from Lincoln's simple topper, to Dorothy's technicolor footwear, each a testament to America's diverse story. But one piece of history remains missing, the story of American music. As part of that story, the exhibition displays an object that's not an instrument, but the perfect symbol for a musical voice unique to America. He was blind by the age of seven. Yet, Ray Charles' musical genius was undeniable. And by his death, he had become one of the most influential American musicians of our time. When I see those sunglasses, I think of the obstacles that Ray Charles overcame to become an innovator, a person who helped create a whole new style of music. * oh beautiful far spacious skies... * Ray Charles was hailed as a pianist, a songwriter, and a band leader. But surely his most enduring contribution was as a singer. He drew so much on his life's experience that you could say his voice was the voice of experience, perhaps even the voice of America. If not the voice of America, surely one of its most special, unique and wonderful voices. * I'm talking about America, sweet America * * you know, god done shed... We're very pleased to have Ray's Ray-bans, Ray Charles' sunglasses which are as an iconic a symbol of him as anything we could possibly have on display, so much so that upon Ray Charles' death, the editorial cartoonist, Mike Peters, penned a single frame editorial cartoon showing a pair of sunglasses with a big old tear coming down the side. There was a no caption except "Ray Charles." It didn't need a caption. These sunglasses really stand for Ray Charles. Using only 150 objects from a collection of three million, the Smithsonian's national museum of American history has created a new perspective on America. It is a story that unfolds using the greatest pieces of history from a collection unmatched in its scope. But the museum's treasure not only describe the events and people of the past... They offer a unique journey through the American experience.
