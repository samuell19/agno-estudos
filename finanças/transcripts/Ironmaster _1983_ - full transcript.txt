For many thousands of years ago, there was an awful weapon and the war has been invented. Don't be impatient, Iksay. The news you are waiting for is just around the corner. We have been hunting in the next few days. There are no traces of the game. Gasellerna is gone, as well as the badgers, fallow deer and wild boar. There is only a buffalo, but how are we going to be able to attack them? Don't worry, the great Zot does not allow us to starve to death. Unfortunately, the ground is shaking a long time, the last couple of days. The animals are in fresh danger, and hide in the woods. What is it that makes you feel sad? I need to select the tribe's new leader. "As you have made up your mind? I'm too old. Someone else can take my place. An able and courageous man, who is able to take advantage of your wisdom. - Calm down, Vood. - I want to be, Ela. Do not weary yourself before the hunt. Vood like to be a leader, but he could not restrain himself. For a woman to have more discipline than him. How is he going to be able to lead others? You were like his. A wild ungbuffel as well as rain, thunder, lightning, and wind. By the time you've been with a man. It will be the same for the Vood. "I'm not convinced of that, Ra. Are you thinking of someone else? Speak in Iksay, and I need to know about it. - Ela to convince me. "It goes against tradition. Vood, your woman's children. It is he who must take the lead. Iksay! Iksay! The wild boar. Many of the. , In the valley, beyond the area. "What are you waiting for! Vood, you are not a leader yet. Wait here with the others. Ra, the Zots, the name, then I ask you: If the hunt is successful? Human beings are often more dangerous than the animal. - You speak obscurely. What do you mean? Be careful. Others are looking for prey. Please pay attention. I'm with you, no matter what. "What is it? - Rogh! Rogh! - Why is the shout you get? - "Hide you in the cave. Don't cry. Calm down, calm down. Iksay. Iksay. The death of the. B. Great Zot, take Iksays of the spirit.

When the sun rises, in line with the tradition of will be of you in the lead for the Zots strain. 'No!' Vood is not fit to be a leader. He was murdered in Iksay. He needs to be punished. That's enough! What are you waiting for? To take him out. Vood, have come into contact with his own people's blood. He does not belong to our tribe anymore. - Vood will be hunted as prey. - , Ela is right! - Today, Ela is our leader. - , Ela! Ela! Run! Watch out! Please help! Mom!!! Mom!!! Vood! - Who are you?

"No. Vood to follow god's will. He was forced to kill the Iksay, and Ra. With this, the Zots tribe is invincible. If Vood. The fire god says it is. Otherwise, be angry with him. The earth is shaking, and everything is burned down. Who of you recognize me, don't like their leader? Bring him to me! This time, I will save your life. For six days and nights, be sure to stop at the apes ' land. No weapons, no food and no water. We'll have to see how to do it. God gave me a weapon. The one who follows me will get a like. - Vood! - Vood! It was god's will that I might find the perfect weapon. We are going to be a tribe of the conquerors. Others may not work for us. Others may supply us with food. We will be the rulers. We are going to show that the hero wins. We are going to introduce a new law. No one can be against us. We have to be ruthless to everyone. It will be a pity if those who refuse to obey. Vood! Vood! Please follow me." - Stop! What do you want?" - "None". There is some wear. Wait. To rest of you. Put yourself in there. "What is it? - Don't worry. It will make you happy. It is in the right here. This. Run! Run! - The pain is gone. "As a good thing. - Iza. My name is Iza. - , Ela.

"I can't be bothered. "Come, beyond the forest, we are safe and secure. Go ahead of time. - Iza! Did you feel bad? "No. Here, take my hand." Put yourself in a. However, it is, of course, Vood. To see the way. Com. Forward. Take those twigs. We are going to enter. Clock in, he's all yours. "There are no more of them. , We. , Who was a man with a lion's head? - Vood. We are among the Zots strain. We live in the mountains and beyond the stars. As a little hunting together. His father, the great Iksay, led by the us. "But you did not love each other? "No. Vood's heart became proud and cruel. For he will despise the tradition. I realized too late just how dangerous he is. - It is he who has hurt you? "Yes." Vood don't want to have rivals. He wants to kill me." He's got a new coat of arms, and the tribe's compliance. My father will help you, Ela. You are assured of the Mogos village. - Stay as you are. Damage to him. He is a child. Don't be afraid. My name is Iza, I'm a friend of yours. "What is your name? - Daal. Voods of the tribe in need of powerful warriors. You are going to bear a child. You are all men and all men belong to you. If they are healthy, strong, and faithful our god is. The god who gave us this: "the power of Darkness, the light and the fire of the ruler. God Efferon. Efferon. Efferon. To have a look. Behind every fire there is a nomads. In two of the phases of the moon, all the strains belonging to the Vood. Look it up, Vood. You are able to get rid of a powerful king, but watch out for the Ela. Ela will be put to death. No one can withstand this new weapon's power. "What has happened? - A bear attacked us. Have a look, there is the Mogos of the tribe. Iza! "It is up to you. Thank You, Oria. - Father. - Iza. Eat. Well. Iza said that you were wounded by a man from your own tribe. The wound is open. You'll get the rest on here. Hospitality is a sacred value for us. Thank You, Mogo. It makes me feel better. Your daughter has been caring for me. I've heard of Zots tribe, who live in the interior. It is said that in the day ye eat the flesh of animals, as well as the city of the tribe. The hague, the tribe is no more. The man with the lion-head took it. The man called Vood. I don't understand. This has to be one of them. Why do Vood come into contact with the city of blood? Vood is much worse than that of Rogh, with the sharp teeth. Vood is more ferocious than the brown bear with its strong claws. He has killed up to Iksay, and Ra, and the wise men. He was trying to kill me. Unfortunately, the dominate, is often to the bestial instinct of the human being. In each and every one of us lurks the evil one. That makes brothers of enemies. We have to fight against the enemies of his wisdom and the power of persuasion. "We should love, not hate. - Do you think it is possible to, Mogo? Anything and everything is possible. The mighty Efferon, you've given me this weapon. With these weapons, I will conquer the land that has risen out of the water. The land of the long shadows, in the country, which is always greened. With these weapons, I will conquer all, and the honor of your name. Hurry up and enter. The village lies beyond the forest, on the lake shore. If my eyes don't deceive me, and so is the Ela of the village. And this time, he couldn't get away. - I'm going to have to kill him. Let's go. Ela would like to have a variety of weapons. Elah to fight against the Rogh, with the long teeth. No. Mogos tribe has no weapons. We don't need any weapons. But the beast is destroying the Mogos village, if not the Mogo to defend themselves. We can't go against the grain of our nature. The weapons are the bad guys. Unfortunately, the arms, to bloodshed, and that is a bad thing. "Life is sacred to us. - Iza, which is why he does not want to understand? Mogo is the way. Mogo talk sense. Ela, do not be Rogh. Rogh time has passed. Rogh but Vood is coming soon, and Vood does not go their way. Vood, may stem the blood flow. Mogo hasn't done Vood ill. And Vood does not Mogo bad. Rogh. Mogo, you can't let the beast kill the women and children. "You need to stop it. - , Ela is right. Let's go. What do you consider to be the right one. Where is the Ela? Where has he been hiding? Bring him here dead or alive. Find him and kill him. Watch carefully over her. She might know where the Ela is hiding. Stop. You can't do anything for her. We have to find him. He will have to move. - Search for. He can't have gone far. "In way of you. Com Ela, before it's too late in the day. Com. From now on, Vood you, the new leader. None of you for a long time. Not even in your life. It all belongs to the Vood. Glory be to Vood, and the greatest warrior. - Vood. - Vood! In honor Vood, honor, your king." - Glory be to Vood! - Vood! The women stay in the village and work. They are subject to the institute of technology. Able-bodied men to come with us. Now, we know that there is food in abundance here. It is here, the people, were to be serve. I will leave the village in your hands, the Clock. The warriors are replaced every six mo. - They don't hang out with them. - Put your trust in me. If you continue to chase the Ela? Why is that? The eagle kills the snake, only when it dares to show itself. Don't touch them. They are a group of viruses. We need to walk away. The wounds and causes of death. Everything in here is tainted. The Fort here. Great Vood, there is a need for more men in order to wear off all of the iron. Soon we will have more and more of the men. "You did that on purpose, your a fool. "No. Get up. To work. We will have to do many of these things. It is wise Mogo does not come to an agreement. If Mogo is the way he knows that his ideas are the only functions in the wild. But freedom is found in Mogos words are just words in the wind. Ela is right, but the Mogos heart is heavy. Let Mogo take off his eyes of the blood. Please keep in mind: the Weapons you can give you the freedom back in the day. However, in the morning, they can deprive you of it. We can't let him go. To stop him, Ela. He has made his choice. "But he will not survive in the forest. If he stays, he needs to offer up their ideas. Mogos wisdom is more to it than that. His selection is worthy of our respect. - Stay as you are, old-timer. Where are you going? From everywhere and nowhere. I'm looking for berries to eat and water to drink. - What is the tribe you belong to? - Vildkaninernas of the tribe. And in the forests, and all of the other animals. "You're lying. If you run with us? "I have no reason to be. You are a provocateur. That's what you are. Have a look at this weapon. It is the symbol of the god of Efferon. The case of the knee. "What are you waiting for? - Case upon his knees. - A kiss to it. - Do as he says, the old-timer. If. You asked for it, your old man an idiot. Now, are you, Voods slaves. I am a leader. What was yours is mine. I have dominion over life and death. Thanks to this weapon, forcing you to bend down. You need to be working for me, if you want to stay alive. Collect all of the fresh men, and take them to the volcano. Where do they dig up the black stone cornerstone in place, the day and the night. If anyone dares to rise up... - A good one. Is the Voods weapons? No, but it Vood do not expect an attack. He is full of confidence. Speed. - I'm asking you... - don't Try to escape again. Now you are in charge of the women. If anyone tries to escape will cost you your life. To work. You guys are the chosen ones. You guys are the warriors that can't be beat. Efferon has chosen you, that ye should honor the Vood, and for the people. Vood takes you higher and higher. One day we will become masters of the world. What is Taag? - Vood, why don't we? "What do you say? Vood can be satisfied. We have taken a lot of people. We are the rulers of the valley. No one will dare to rebel. When you quit the exercise of its power, it is the beginning of the end. We are living in the battle. War is our purpose in life. What can it be used a weapon to silence? "Everybody hates us, Vood. "No," they will fear us. We can't stop it. Don't forget, Ela. As long as he's alive- -we are in trouble. I was his slave. Its origin is lost. I had to be obedient to him, but for now, I want to take revenge. "In what way? - Vood is a cunning and slippery. However, he has been a sore point: the fact that Vood is doing what, as a whole, in order to prove his power. - Don't trust her, she's lying. "No," how does it benefit me to lie? If you want to get revenge, you'll see that he's coming here either. - What is your plan? I just want to challenge him. Go to the Vood is now. You are clever, to convince him. - Do you trust her? "No. However, Vood must know that I am here. Where is my father? He would have preferred to go. He didn't want to see his the tribe to fight. However, you have to fight, Iza. Along with me, to Vood. As for the others, do what you do. "It is a suicide. Our boys are not warriors. Vood has been one of god's weapons. The weapon is man-made. Vood, have a lot of strain. How are you going to stop them? Neither the number of the men or their guns scare me. They are different, and Iza. For them, life has no value. They love to kill. It scares me, Iza. "We must put a stop to them. - You'll also spills the blood of the. What is the difference between them? I can understand why my father left. Maybe I should do as he says. Watch the Ela, this is what the tree is. We can't be beat Vood, with a few boughs, and Daal. - Why did you stop? "I have won. The war was over. You don't think so. It's just stupid. They have horrible weapons, and fought to kill. When you're on the ground, undoes the top stomach in the er. Step right up and start all over. "You are too hard on them. - It is not enough. You are blinded by your father's ideas. Why, do you not? My father made his choices and I make mine. I would like to help you out. I was thinking of stopping by. "Can't you not sleep? - I don't get tired. But now I'm going to sleep. Vood! Vood! He is a boy, and three women. The women don't count. You can easily kill him. A dozen men will suffice. "I would also like to fight. Where do we go? - Impatience is associated with passion. There's a dangerous feel to it. The suspect, Ela you? No, I don't think so. Go back to the village. Let's say I accept the challenge and are going it alone. Tighten it a little to aim for. Say to yourself, "I'm spike, and I'm going to hit the target." I am in the lead. To meet the goal. Well. Don't even think about the next day. Iza fight by your side. We can do it, you'll see. Ela! Vood, in the morning. Alone. "All Right, Linköping Institute Of Technology. Go to the others now. "But Ela... Go back to your seat and pay attention. Stop Ideas!! He is our friend. Sorry, Iza, and in the darkness he looked like one of the Voods men. - What are they, and Iza? - Tracks, and the Jeda, which the men of our tribe. "What has happened? How did you get here? We managed to escape. Vood, forcing us to work. In two days we have been wandering without any food. It is better to die, and Iza, than it is to be Voods of the slave. - Please help us. Yes, if you'll help us to beat Vood. No, no, you stay here. Ela! Ela! Where are you Ela? Ela! To stay there. - Vood! Vood! - , Ela! Look it up, Vood! Here I am, Vood. Vood! - You must hurry! - Vood! Stop. Please come back. Coward, to attack. Ela. You won't Spli. But one day, there will be another Vood. Remember, in Ela: a Weapon can give you the freedom back in the day "but in the morning, they can deprive you of it. Violence gives birth to violence.
