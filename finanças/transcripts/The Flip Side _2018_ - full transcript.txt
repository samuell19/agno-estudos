And cut, thank you. Okay, moving on. Okay, clear the set, everyone. Henry to makeup. Okay, Henry to makeup, thank you. Ronnie, stay at my hotel tonight. I'll get my driver, pick you up, and we can go to that new restaurant. You're always hungry, Henry. You will love London. The food is amazing. Henry Salbert to makeup, thank you. I think I should be much dirtier, don't you think, if you're playing a tradie. If you're in Australia and you're doing, this is not the way. I don't see the role like this. How can you be clean? Agree with me, agree with me on this, okay? Agree with. Makeup one, Henry, now, please. Have you seen Mr. Salbert? Ronnie, will you come to London with me? Come to London with me. Mr. Salbert? They're ready for you. I wanna go to London with you. Mr. Salbert? Great. I ask him for one thing. Babes, can't you remember anything? Bistro Blue. Can I speak with Veronica, please? Speaking. Hello, Veronica, this is Nathan from First National. Oh, hi, Nathan, how are you? Good, thanks. I'm calling to let you know that everything is progressing with your application, but we're... - Fantastic! - We're still waiting on your last quarter financials. Really, that's strange. I sent them last week. I'll email them again so you'll have everything by tomorrow. Great. Can you process the loan today? Absolutely, as soon as we have that paperwork, we will. Have to cross the Ts and dot the umlauts, as my boss likes to say. Okay. Okay, bye. Nicely. Nicely. - Okay. I am. I've brought some swordfish for your lunch, Mom, with capers and fennel. It's beautiful. But it's pineapple tuna mornay today. I just thought my swordfish might be a little bit tastier. Well, you have it, Veronica. Or you could give it to whatsit. Jeff. Yes, him. I need some new slippers, Veronica. My feet get so cold. Okay, well, I'll bring some on Wednesday. I've gotta go back to work now. Oh, can you drop me off at the beach, please, darling? Another time. I promise. You say that. I can't go out today. It's pineapple tuna mornay for lunch. No, I understand. Did you bring my magazines? I'll bring them on Wednesday when I bring the slippers. But someone might do the puzzles. They steal them, they do the puzzles, and they put them back. Do they? That's not on. Well, I'll make sure the puzzles are clean, okay? Have a nice day. See you Wednesday. Miss James, can I have a quick word? Oh, look, I'm in a huge rush. Can I call you later today? - You canceled our meeting, which I don't appreciate. Yeah, I know, I'm really sorry. But Iris told me yesterday your father might be able to help you now. Why are you talking to her about him? You'll make her anxious. It's Nigel, right? Yes. Yeah, I know you're new here, but my so-called father jumped ship 20 bloody years ago, and, frankly, I think it's ridiculous that you would take anything she says seriously. We have a substantial problem here, and I'm afraid we've gone as far as we're prepared to go. Okay, I'm sorry. Please, she's been here for two years. I can't move her. I can pay everything I owe next month. I've got a huge wedding job coming up. Can't her bond just cover the shortfall just this once? I'm afraid we've run out of options. We've identified a good state care home, and there'll be a bed available for her in three weeks, on the 17th. Next Friday, five pm, you'll need to sign the paperwork. Look, I'm sorry, but we all need to move on. Let's cat-proof. Most cats can make a pretty high jump. There she is. How was your day, babes? - Meh. - My dad called. He's invited us over for lunch when we get back next week. He's gonna make his seafood lasagne. - Oh, God. - I know, it's disgusting. Hey, you've got one more day and you're officially on holidays. Officially, after the wedding cake tasting on Tuesday. Piece of cake. Ah. Can you turn that down? So, did you get any writing done today? Yep. Just got a couple of minor little tweaks. You've been saying that for a couple of months. Oh! Oh, yes. Set face to stun. What? Have a guess who called here today. Really, have a guess. You're never gonna get it. Okay, you're being very annoying. Henry Salbert. See? He called here and wanted to know if we would go for a drink with him. Not him himself, like, his assistant called up and wanted to know if we'd go for a drink with him. She's got a very sexy French accent. French? Hang on, a drink with Henry? In London? No, here. He's coming over from Sydney for a screening of his new movie on Monday. Are you joking? No. It's Sam, isn't it? She's French. How long ago did you work with him? I can't, I don't know. Maybe four, five years. Well how did he know this number? I have no idea. Well, you must have made a very good impression on him. I worked in unit catering. We barely spoke. Really? She said you were his personal chef. No, I wasn't. Well, I mean, yeah, I'd make his specials if he asked for anything. Well, anyway, we're going to have a drink with a movie star, it's cool. I said we'd pick him up from the airport. Jeff! What? Well, that's embarrassing. It's like we're a car service or something. Chill, babe, it's gonna be so much fun. No more lost cats or dead birds. Perfect! Thank you. Enjoy, fellas. Why do they all get the bloody burger? Because, A, it's bloody delicious, and, B, it's bloody delicious. So is the swordfish. Jesus, I'm giving it away. Why do I even bother? Come on, whats' up? Oh, nothing really. It's kind of weird. You'll think it is. So I'm listening. You know, well, Henry Salbert's coming to Adelaide. Back the truck up. What the hell for? Screening of his new film. Publicity thing. - Wow. - Yeah. Said he wanted to have a drink with us. Well, what are you gonna do? Oh, it's water under the bridge. Ah, so you've told Jeff about him. No, why would I do that? Because, oh, gee, I don't know, he's your boyfriend, and if he finds out, he might go apeshit? Yeah, I'm not gonna complicate this. One quick drink, in, out, end of. Ronnie, be careful. Don't be so dramatic, Sam. It's fine. You know, I hear the French don't like to speak English. I would've done it in school, but they didn't offer it. They do at the private ones, but, I don't know, I think they should offer it at all the schools, give everyone the same chance, don't you think, babes? Oh, look, they could be in that one. Henry. Hi. Hello. It's good to see you again. - Hello. - Hello. I'm Sophie. - Nice to meet you. Yes, thank you. Do me. Oh, this is my boyfriend Jeff. Jeff, delighted. Thank you. - Oh, um. - Good day, Sophie, welcome to Adelaide. - Hello. - Hello. Oh, yes, two. Got you. Hey, Henry, I'm sure you hear this all the time, but your film What We Know, it changed the way I saw the world. I mean, I was like 10 years old when I first saw it. Yeah, thanks. Yes, Henry is so old. Oh, no, no, he didn't mean... Oh my God, mate, I didn't mean that. I'm not that old. No, you're not old. No, no. So? Yes, yeah, I'll get the bags, yeah. - Oh, thank you. - You're gonna get that one? - Yeah, I'll take some. - I can hold my bags, thanks. - Okay. - Yeah. - Thank you. - I've got this, no, no. Sydney is amazing. What a city. Yeah, it's really beautiful. Sydney does my head in. The traffic, the noise. Oh, our flight was noisy. They let a baby fly first class, I mean. I'd forgotten how peaceful it was here. Houses are ready. It's a line from The Castle. A great Aussie film. I've heard of it, I've never seen it. It's a classic, it is a classic. You guys should watch it 'cause it's absolutely hilarious, yep. So, Jeff, what do you do? I teach high school science. Ronnie found herself a good man. You want another one? - Yeah. - Yeah. - No thanks. - I'll help you, Jeff. Cheers, Sophie. Thanks, mate. Back in a tick. So how are you, Ronnie? How have the years been treating you? I own a restaurant now. That's great. Is it a success? Tell me it's a big success. How did you get my number, Henry? I'm clever like that. Jeff seems nice. Those who can, do, those who can't, oh no, that's awful, sorry. Didn't mean that. He only teaches part-time. He's a writer. Just finished his first novel. Is he? - Here we go. - Ronnie tells me you're a novelist. Oh, I don't know about that. Yes, you are. Well, you can't really call yourself a writer until you get published. Yes, you can. I met Harold Pinter once for a project. - Harold Pinter? - Yep. And he sits me down and says, Henry, one thing, never name drop. That's all he said. So what's your novel about? It's a short story, really. It's a... - Go on. Yes, Jeff, tell us. Okay. Do you know Murakami, the Japanese writer? Of course. No. You could just say that I'm in that world, tonally. Really. I would never have expected you to say that. I am a huge fan of existentialism. Are you? It's fantastic, isn't it? Yes, it is. Please, go on. Well, it's about a spider who falls in love with a girl. Right. A spider? Yeah, it's very different. She's in a fragile relationship, so she takes her boyfriend on a trip to the bush, where she hopes that they might be able to strengthen their bond, with no distractions. What is the bush? It's another word for the outback. The countryside. Yeah, only shitter. He means it isn't very pretty. Oh, the French bush is very beautiful, Jeff. It's true. Yeah, Sophie. So what happens there? Well, they stop past a quarry, where a spider sees the girl, and immediately falls in love with this girl. So he gets in their car, goes back to the city with them, and then becomes completely obsessed. So, driven by an all-consuming jealousy, he kills her boyfriend, bites him on the head while he's taking a shower. That's fantastic. Obviously, there's more to it. Yeah. It's called Bite. See what I did there? I see what you did there. You're lucky you caught us, actually. We're going away on Wednesday to the quarry that Jeff sued for inspiration. Mm hmm, I've finally convinced the workaholic to take a break. A quarry? A big hole. A big hole in the shitter bush? Oh, Jeff, can I be at the hotel by 6:30? There's an online sale starting at 7:00, and it takes a long time to check Henry in. He's very fussy. I am not very fussy. Yes, you are. - I am not. - Yes, you are. We thought you were Henry's assistant. Oh, no, I fired Henry's assistant. Zoe was an imbecile. Hey, why don't you come to our place? I'll fire up the barbecue, and then we can drop you at the hotel later. No, but Sophie's gotta be at the hotel for this online thing, Jeff. We've got WiFi. Okay, this could be fun. If you're not too tired. Ronnie's barbecues are legendary. No, they're not. Best I've ever tasted. Oh, we only eat organic meat. Is your meat organic, babes? Of course it is. Great! It's starting. Oh. Wow, what fantastic shorts. Do you want a pair, Veronica? Only 80 down from 400. I don't really wear shorts. I'll treat you, Ronnie. I'm fine, thanks, Henry. What size are you, Veronica, 14? No, I'm a size 10. But Australian 10 is an American six, which is a French 38. No, I don't think so. Yes. We have small, medium, and large. You have a size zero. What the hell is a size zero? Darling, American zero is French 32 and Australian four. Veronica, for example, she's a size 14, so she's only five times bigger than a size zero, in Australian sizing. I'm a 10. Oh, they only have English eight. Too small for you, Veronica, sorry. Not to worry. Delicious, absolutely delicious. - Henry! - What? That's disgusting. No, my palate is trying to reconstitute itself from school dinners at Eton, whereas this is the nectar of the goods. Yeah, why would you add anything to meat that's this good? Just salt and pepper, that's all you need. Did you go to Eton? At boarding school since the age of seven. Boarding school are for the English who don't like to look at their children. Oh, did I tell you about the truffle farm in Tasmania? First harvest last year... Nothing can compare to our truffles. Whatever. They are divine. They are fucking divine. Henry. They are, my darling. You know what? French have very sophisticated palates. We know what's the best. I hear that truffles smell like testicles. Yes, they say that. How the fuck do they know that? Well, now I know why you like to hang out in the locker room at my rugby club, babes. Not funny. So, Henry, did you play rugby at Eton? No, fencing. Errol Flynn. I won the nationals twice. Wow. You wanna see? Okay. It's all about balance. It's much more refined than you think. Bravo. Well that's how I won the nationals. So, Henry, mate, what time is your big event tomorrow? Six o'clock. Wanna come? That would be great. Great. And I've been thinking about your spider story. I think it could make a cool film. A film? Thought of writing a screenplay? Well, no, but I'd love to give it a go. I think you should. Yes, Jeff. But the spider has to be a man, the nemesis of the boyfriend. Yeah, but that would make it a completely different story. Very sexually powerful and virile man. You know, that's very interesting, Henry. Come on, Jeff. Darling, we must go. I think our hotel is calling us. Thank you for the food. - Thank you for dinner. It's a pleasure. Hey! Why don't you guys just stay here? We've got a spare room, easy as. Ow! Well, no, they've got a hotel booking. Fuck the hotel, come on. Anyway, we've had too much to drink. No driving. That's nice, but we can get a taxi, and I don't want to pack Henry twice. We leave early Wednesday morning. We leave Wednesday, too. Stay both nights. It's all good, come on. Aw. - Yeah? - Sure. Okay, we can stay. Thank you, Jeff. What do you think, Ronald? Great. Come here. Come on. Oh yeah, you guys. I'll just get the spare room ready. - Good on you, babes. - Thank you. Jesus, Henry! I like watching you. You're drunk. You know, I asked them to include Adelaide on... Stop it. Why? Hi, Sophie. So here's your bed. Oh, how old were you here, Veronica? Oh, about nine, I guess. You had beautiful skin then. Thank you. Pillows, I'll get you some more. Babe. Why did you invite them to stay? You look so sexy tonight, babes. I love your guts. Come here. Jeff, I need to tell you something. When Henry and I were working together. Oh, Henry! Yes, yes! Hey. I bet you that means "harder." Or it could mean "deeper." Hey, hold court, I'll go find out. I'll Google it. Shit, I hope their window's closed. Good morning. Morning. Did you sleep well? Not too much. It's a sex bruise. Oh, I hope my fucking didn't wake you up. No! 'Cause Henry says I make too much noise. No. Do you have any fresh orange juice? Yep. There you go. - Thanks. I would feel so isolated if I had to live here. I mean, where is the energy, the culture? You should move to Sydney. But is anyone really isolated anymore with the Internet? What Internet? Your Internet is so bad. Do you have any family nearby? Just my mom. Does she live close? She's in a home. Oh, lucky you. You know, you could go on a cruise this morning. It's just around the corner. You might see some dolphins. No way! I love that. Henry, wake up, we're going on a cruise to see dolphins! On the left, folks, is a famous landmark here in Port Adelaide, the cement factory. Just imagine, all the bridges and shopping centers around our great state that were built with concrete from this majestic facility. Is everything ready? This has to be right, Sam. Good morning. Oh, sorry. Good morning. Hey, the landlord left you a letter. And these look incredible. Honestly, the merengue is perfect this time, and I wasn't sure about the green, but it's really going with it all. It just looks amazing, the whole thing. What? No! It looks great, Ronnie. Ronnie. - Hello! - Hello! Oh, this is so exciting. Look, Mom, look, it's so pretty. Hi, Brittany, hi, Gail. Hi. Definitely the chocolate. Jason loves chocolate. Let's just taste them first, sweetheart. I don't need to, Mom, I dreamed about this last night. Definitely the chocolate. Mm, I was right. You've made a good decision. I know. Chocolate, yay! Thanks, Ronnie, I'll send the deposit through next week. Absolutely. Well, have a good one! - Yeah, you, too. - Bye now. - Bye. - Bye. Bye. Thank God. Well, come on, Henry, tell all. Uh oh. No. Didn't you meet him? Yeah, yeah, we did. With his girlfriend, too. Oh, well that would be right. She's French. Of course she is. We picked them up from the airport. You did not. We had a drink. I did a barbecue for them. You what? And then it got late. We were too drunk to drive, so they stayed over. Ex-squeeze me, are you serious? Henry stayed at your place last night? With his girlfriend. And they're leaving tomorrow. You invited the man who smashed your heart to smithereens for a pajama party? You're playing with fire, Ron, and it's just like... Leave it, Sam, okay? Just leave it. I have no words. Do you wanna take some cake home? No, but you should. Hey. How was it? It was odious. Veronica called it a cruise. Two hours on a muddy river trapped with an idiot telling you what's obvious. Never do it, Jeff. Oh, well. Can we go to the beach now? - Sure, yeah. - Okay, great, let's go. Oh, no, but we should wait because Ronnie will wanna come, and where's Henry? Oh, still taking selfies with fans. He needs to do that. Oh, tonight should be fun then. Tonight, everyone will tell Henry how amazing he is, and he gets puffed up like a balloon. They should ask me what he's really like. Oh, I bet you've got some good stories. Do you like to be shocked, Jeff? Hi! Hey. How was the tasting? Bloody brilliant. Anyone for some cake? Oh yes, please. Oh, no, thanks. If I wanna fit my bikini for the beach. Ew, don't, Jeff. Hey, Ronnie, hang on. They're 95% water, you know? What's the point of them? Hey, so did you grow up in Paris? Yes, and I lived in Marseilles, too, for six years. I went to law school there. You know, I was actually going to do law, as well. I just, I don't know, I thought it might be a bit hard. Marseilles changed my life completely. How's that? At university, I had my first affair with my professor. - With a teacher? Yeah, we were both adults, Jeff, no laws were broken. I'm sure. But he was much older than me, so we fractured. You split up. - Yeah. - Yeah. This is beautiful. Whatever. What's up? Work's just a bit stressful, that's all. Well, restaurant, you know, it's gotta be tough, but you're doing what you said you'd do. I'm proud of you. I'm gonna go mad if I don't say it. Say what? I was packed and ready to move to London, Henry, and nothing. Nothing. Zoe answering the phone every time I called. "Henry's unable to take any calls. "Can I give him a message?" Yeah! You can tell him to fuck right off. Hang on a second. I was filming in Bucharest with a crazy director. You should have had the balls to tell me yourself, not get some stupid little tart to do your dirty work. Tell you what? I couldn't talk to you, no one could talk. It was lockdown, radio silence. That was his bloody rules. And Zoe told you that. She said she told you that. I'm sure she did. Whatever! Yeah, well, did she tell you or did she not tell you? That's kind of an important thing here. Yes. And? Well, I didn't believe her. Why not? And when I can finally call you, there's nothing there, no one's answering. So what am I to think? I think all those messages. I get the final one, and I think, well, you've gone. I don't know, I'm not gonna stalk you. Is it Jeff, did Jeff turn up at that point? Oh, don't you! This is not about Jeff and you know it. I didn't speak to you because you wouldn't... I did not walk away from you, Ronnie, I did not walk away from you! That's just not true. After that, I met a German boy, Dieter. We fell in love. But Dieter got killed. He was murdered. No! The police found my poor boy in a barrel by the docks. His penis had been cut off and put in his mouth. It was my teacher. He said he did that because I mustn't have sex with anyone else, but nobody can tell me who to have sex with. No, yeah, no, of course not. But, still, I mean, Jesus Christ! Your story about the spider, it reminded me so much of this time in my life. It was almost like you knew me, Jeff. I'm really sorry, Sophie. What an awful coincidence. Are you gonna forgive me? You could shoot me, I suppose. Not in the face, I need, in the leg? Okay, that's wrong. Will you ever forgive me? I don't know... - I don't know. Maybe, I'll think about it. Anyway, this, by the way, is a perfect time. You turn up in London, open a restaurant, and, I know you don't want to, and I'm a shithead, but, if you wanna go across this ocean to wherever Britain is, you turn up now, Australians are very hot. All those Aussie actors in Hollywood. Everyone thinks you guys, you know, the sun shines through your ears. What a dream. It doesn't have to be. They'd die, they'd roll over and die. You always loved my food. I love your food. I can't pronounce your food, I love your food. Feels good saying all that out loud to you. Yeah, so you needed to tell me I was a dickhead. You were a dickhead. That I was a shithead. A shithead? - All these things. - You were a shithead. I thought you were the dickhead. Henry normally likes the pretty girls. Oh well. Oh, wow. Wow, you're good at it. Look, Jeff. What is your name, sir? Jean Claude. Jean Claude? That's a good name. Someone's coming, shh. Hello. You look beautiful. You look at me differently. Me or him? Should we go? We shall go. Lead on. - Is he coming? No, he better stay. Let's have another question. The lady in the blue scarf. Hello, I love the film. You were amazing. I thought I was, too. Can you talk about how you prepared for the role, and did you meet the actual doctor who did the real operation? Nice scarf, by the way. I make a point of not meeting the actual people. I feel it will color where I'm going because you can never quite be them, so I'm a perspectivist. I take from many different sources. So that's the technique I use, is attempting to use no technique. I prefer not to do conscious research, but subconscious research. I try to just use the chassis of myself and the life that I have lived, and then drop everything on top of it, and then where we get to might not be exact facsimile of that person, but it gives us these other colors. So, I don't act, I just be. Henry, I have to ask you this, when are you going to make another Australian film? It must be five years since you made Totem right here in Adelaide. How can we tempt you? Well, well, actually, there's a book I'm looking at from a local writer. Yes, so, one can never know. Can you tell us more? I can't tell you anything more than that. It goes against the laws of telling people things. But, you know, it's Adelaide, it's South Australia. You have the wine, and the food here is exceptional. Isn't he special? Give him a round of applause. Your father. Your phone is ridiculous, Henry. Hi, Daddy. Yes. Isabel. Yes, of course, I remember Isabel. Lovely girl. Are you? Congratulations. I'm in Australia. Wedding is when? Saturday, okay. I will be there with bells on. All right, Daddy. Bye bye. Stupid bastard. That's four times, the old sod. It never ends. Wedding is this Saturday, Chelsea Town Hall. You're not going, are you? God, no! I'd rather have my testicles hit with a hammer. But, unfortunately, I'm not gonna be able to go to London on Saturday. Unavoidable delays. What delays? We've gotta go up to Zambeezy with Ronnie and Jeff. You know, Jeff's hole. Oh, yes. I could have some fun with Jeff's hole. Yeah, that sounds horrible. Yeah, I think he's too provincial. He's not right for Ronnie. What do you mean? They are the perfect match. They're two small town people. Henry! Hey! You're a very bad girl. It was the professor at the docks with the cleaver. Why would she tell you that? I mean, she barely knows you. I don't know, maybe it was a French thing. No, no, no, no. I know what it is. She's a man's woman. Probably thinks I'm ugly, too. Nope, no, she doesn't. Oh my God, she said something, didn't she? No! But, babe, what about what Henry said at the screening? Bloody hell. Yeah. Hey, don't get too excited. You heard him. Yeah, I know, it's just these things can take years. Henry Salbert declared publicly he wants to turn my book into a movie. You were there. Yeah. Well, it's just... What? You know... Babe, you tell me to be more ambitious, and then when I am, you shut me down. He's an actor, you know? I just think he said what they wanted to hear, that's all I'm saying. Cheers, babes. I'm gonna go to bed. Jeff. Come on. Have you put on weight, Veronica? Yes, you have. Oh, Fluffy. Have you seen Nigel? No. I want to go to our beach. I can't today, Mom. But you love it there, darling. No, not today. When I was born, my mother said I was unlovable. She said I was the ugliest baby in the hospital. She couldn't look at me for three days. That was a mean thing to say. And it wasn't true. You're beautiful. She wasn't very nice to me. When you and Walter have a little girl, you'll tell her how beautiful she is, won't you? Do you remember Henry, Mom, from London? Think I might go there, open a restaurant. I always wanted to. I can't go there. It's pineapple tuna mornay today. It's okay, I know. Your father's been gone almost a week. He's not coming back this time, mark my words, Veronica. He doesn't give two hoots about us. Here, Mom. And all the puzzles are clear. Ow, ow. It's all that weight you've put on, Veronica. Hey. Hello. - Hi. - Hey, babes. What time's the flight? Change of plans, Ronsie. We're coming with you on your outback adventure. Yeah, Henry needs more rest before we go home. And he wants to read my book on the drive. I do. - What about the flight and... - Jeff, can we go to Hahndorf? It says it has all the antique shops there. Sure, yeah. Henry, coffee. Thank you, Jeffrey. It's a boring drive, though. You'll be really bored. The kangaroos won't be boring. Oh shit, yeah, there's plenty out there, mate. I love kangaroos, they're so cute. I don't know how you can eat them. It's cruel. Oh, I don't eat them. No, they're too gamey. You're the best, Jeff. I've got an idea. Why don't we go to that winery where you used to be chef? That's a great idea. It's not open. No, they are, babes, yeah. No. I'll get the car ready. I love an adventure. Jeff! Ow! Go back in there and uninvite them. Why? It's too much for me. I need a proper break. No, babe, Henry is going to read my book and talk to me about the script. This is my chance, Ronnie. Why you trying to sabotage it? What? Hey! Hey! You good back there, Sophie? I'm really cold, I'm freezing. Let me turn off the AC. Is that better? Aw, thank you, yeah. Welcome to Hahndorf, everybody. Welcome to Hahndorf. Why is there a German town in Australia? There's a huge German population here. Yeah, lots came after the war, too. The Nazis hiding everywhere. They actually did find one here in the 1970s. Only one? As far as I know, yeah. So not a good place for bagels? Exactly. I don't get it. Jeff, because of the Jews. They make all of the real bagel and certainly wouldn't like to be here with Nazis. Oh, bagels are Jewish. You're so funny, Jeff. Henry Salbert. Yep. Someone's gotta be me. I fucking love you! Woo! Is she the mayor? Her breasts were nice. Yes, yes, they were. Hey, Jeff, do you think they will take credit cards at the antique shop? Yeah, most do. Can I borrow some money, just in case, because you know we only use the cards. Yeah, of course. Is 50 okay? Yeah, hopefully. Can I read your book? Yeah, absolutely, yeah. Can I do it now? Yeah, I'll go and get it. All right. Sausage party! I'm surprised he even noticed. She had breasts. I don't know why I like you. It's my job. You really are a bastard. I thought I was a dickhead. That, too. You know, there are a lot of fake people in my industry. Whereas, you are... It's probably why I like you. Hey, they've moved the restaurant. Used to be over there. This is. Very proud of this one. What is? It's German for Longmal, the name of our winery. So it's called Longmal Longmal? That's hilarious, Henry. Longmal Longmal. Langmal Longmal. - Yeah. - It's delicious. It's really good. It's more like a Syrah, isn't it? Yeah, it definitely drinks French, yeah. But it's not, it's Australian. That's right. The French versions tend to be more restrained, like this one. Versions? We are the authors, you are the versions. Oh my God, first, truffles, now Syrah. ITts made from the same variety of grape. In fact, we have the oldest surviving Syrah vineyards in the world. That is fascinating. But, still, you can't call it Syrah. Well, hey, we can rename it for you, Sophie. How about Shazah? Aw, Jeff. Yeah, yeah, sorry, Brittany, I can't quite understand you. Please, stop crying. The wedding's off. - What? - Jason was with another woman the whole time. No, I'm so sorry, Brittany, that is awful. It's over, the wedding's off. Aw, you poor thing. No, of course, of course, of course. - I'm so sorry. - No, I understand. I was just... Yeah. Yeah, yeah, you just look after yourself, okay? Bye. Okay, bye. Hey, what's up? The wedding job's been canceled. Cold feet, huh? Not to worry, another one will come along. It was nine grand, Jeff. Hey, Sophie's still going on about Australians stealing things. French bitch! Whoa! Well she's so obnoxious. Well, she's tactless, but in a funny way. How much was this? 250. - Jeff! - What? This is a bloody good Shazah. You're not funny, Jeff. Sophie thinks so. Hey, guys. Look, bowling! I wanna go bowling! I'm gonna go barefoot. So, it's Jeff and I against you guys. Sounds good. Wanna make it interesting? Yeah, all right. How about 20 bucks? How about 100 bucks. Ooh la la. I hope you have cash, mate. We don't. Hey, this one is mine. Hands off. I should've warned you guys that Ronnie gets a teensy competitive. Don't you, babes? Takes things a bit too seriously. We got this. I know. Have you guys been bowling before? - No. - Yes. This isn't fair. You're hustling us. Don't worry, Sophie. It's not my first rodeo. Oh, you got this, Henry! Oh, Jeff, I read your book. Yeah, and I think I should play the main character. Yes, yeah. Good. Okay. Jeff, do you have small balls? Uh, yeah, yeah. Try this. - Thank you. - Right. Whoa, hey. You get that screenplay finished, and I'll get it to some producers. That would be awesome, Henry. That would be awesome. Jeff. Yeah? Watch me. I'm watching. Your balls are too heavy, Jeff. Yes! Wow. Hey, Jeff, you owe Henry some money. - Oh, no. - Yep. No, I've got my prize. No, no, a bet's a bet. Okay. No, only 50, 'cause I get half. Oh, good one, babes. Oh, Sophie, you owe Jeff 50. Ha, good one again, babes. Piece of crap, Henry. Throw it away. No, I love it. I'm gonna hang it in our Paris apartment. In the toilets. Jeff, Jeff, excuse me. I'm freezing, can you do something? Is that better? Jesus Christ. - Oh, no. It was a kangaroo? - Yeah. - Oh my God. This is great. It was definitely a roo. Oh no, poor kangaroo. I hope he's not dead. Aw! - Shit. Must've been a pretty big fucking kangaroo. Fucking thing's fucking fucked. It's fixable? Oh, fuck yeah. Okay. Yeah, the radiator's fucked. And I don't have one in the shop, although I can get you one by tomorrow. Is there a motel around here? Snuggle Inn. Cheap as chips. All the fucking miners use it. It's got a pretty classy fucking restaurant, too. You can take her there, mate. All right, thanks, mate. What's the verdict? The fucking thing is fucking fucked. Oh, I know this. Ah, I have the small one. Cheers. Cheers. Hey, Angels! Babe. Pretty, huh? Control yourself, babes. Hey, come on, Jeff. You had the nice breasts at the sausage restaurant. Can I say something? Go on, mate, it's a free country. Off you go. I'd like to make a confession. I have done many things in my life of which I am ashamed. If my mother was still alive, it would've broken her heart. So I say fight in your life for everything that's real because every time we lie to ourselves, an angel dies. So, so, Veronica James, will you marry me? Sorry, pal, she's already taken. Oh la la, Henry and his proposals. There are so many, my darlings. Empty! Me, too. Can I get you anything else? Yeah. Oh! Hey, no worries, Sophie. He's probably gay. Yeah, thank you, Jeff. You know, they say, oh, I'm gay, it's really hard for me, but then they fuck all the time, everywhere, inside, outside, all the time. Hey, come on, dirty boy. - Me? - I wanna kiss you. Oops. No tongues. Hey, sexy boy! Put some music on for me. I wanna dance. Come on, Jeff. Oh yeah! Come on you, guys, gear up. I think that's quite enough wine for me. Ronnie, come on. What is that? - Oh, fuck. - You all right, Sophie? Whoa, whoa. - Oh la la. Oh, no. Someone needs a bit of walk outside. I've got her, here. There you go. Ew. Better? There you go. Hello. Good morning. My mom loves the beads. Yes, they keep the fucking flies off the sugar, don't they? Why don't you just have it? Really? Are you sure? Let me gift wrap it for you. Thank you. You guys ready? There was something wrong with the wine. I was sick all night. Yeah, I don't think so. Maybe it was your salad. Perhaps it wasn't organic. The wine poisoned me. We all drank it. But I'm a tiny person. She was sick all night. I didn't sleep. Headline news, people. The radiator didn't come in, so we'll be staying another night. - No! - No! Aw! I'm gonna go in. It'll be worth the wait, Sophie. The quarry's amazing. Up for a swim, babes? If you'd been driving more carefully, we wouldn't have to stay in this shithole. Okay, here we go. Oh well, as long as Princess Sophie's not too cold, we're all good, aren't we? And what is with her calling me Veronica? Do they not use diminutives in Paris? Why are you being so shitty? It's 1200 bucks to fix the car. We're ripped. - 1200? Yeah. Jesus! You know she's blaming the Syrah for making her sick? She was spewing her guts up outside the restaurant. She was pretty sick. Well she ate a single lettuce leaf all day and then drank two bottles of our wine, of course she was sick. Probably not used to Australian Syrah. If she says one more thing about Australia, I swear to God, I am going to lose it. And did you have to pay for dinner? Why are we always paying? I'm going for a swim. Anyone fancy a swim? Oh, there's a pool? Yeah. Yeah. Not for me. You guys enjoy. Henry. You okay? You can come in if you want. Sophie and Jeff have gone for a swim. Ta da. Gift from a fan. I haven't smoked in years. We used to love getting stoned together. Remember that time with those chickens, the ones that were trying to escape? No. They had the right idea. I'll spin out. No, you won't. Happy now? I'm happy. There you go. Oh, it's so strong. Hey, Jeff. Look, I do synchronized swimming. Wow. Ah, we call that one the Australian Crawl. I think Sophie hates me. It's not personal. She has complex issues. You know, her boyfriend was murdered. - Murdered. She told Jeff. I can't imagine, it's terrible. She said she had to identify his body. She said she had to identify his penis. How do you identify a penis? Do a lineup? Where do you get the other penises? No, just wait. I've waited too long. I don't think you can do that here 'cause there could be kids. So? I've missed you so much. I don't think so, no. - Sophie. - No. We agreed on 20%, I'm sure. Ah, okay, yeah, yeah, of course, yeah. No problem, yes, send it to me on my email. Okay, perfect, thanks a lot, have a nice day. What? Well, the studio just called. You are now, officially, Lister Man. Lister Man was cast months ago. Well, Leo dropped out, they are desperate. I got you an incredible deal! Are you serious? Do I ever make jokes about business? Henry, did you hear me? Yes! Yes, fucking hell, yes! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you, thank you. Thank you. - So happy for you. Thank you. Do you know what this means? Of course, you are moving to Hollywood, baby. We are moving to Hollywood. We leave in two days, unless you prefer to be a little spider in Australia? No. It's not working. Veronica, Henry cannot do Jeff's film anymore. Can you please tell him? I'm not your messenger girl, Sophie. You need to talk to Jeff. Jeff is nice, I don't want to upset him. Oh, Jeff is funny, too, funny Jeff. We should've gone back to Sydney after the screening. And then who would've bankrolled your holiday? You don't like me because you don't like women. You judge them. No. You're the one who hates women. Thank God I'll never see you again after this. Finally, we can agree on something. No, no, you're the, whatever that is. Hey, Henry. Yeah? Hey, I was wondering if I could have a chat to you about Bite. What? Bite, my book. Oh, yeah, yes. Yeah, I was just wondering what your thoughts were on the ending. Yeah, I can see, yeah. Well, yeah. I don't see why not. I mean, you know, it's a hero's ending, isn't it? Is it? The hero prevails. No, he doesn't, it's a tragedy. The spider throws himself in the coffin at the funeral. He buries himself alive. What a way to go. Yeah, oh, yes, well of course, you know, you see, I hadn't read it that way. I read it the other way. Understood. You know, but keep it up, keep working on it. He hasn't read it. Fucking idiot. Darling, I need to wee. Come look out for snakes. - Again? - Yeah, you gotta watch out for them. Okay, call to action. Snakes. Did you sleep with her? What? You and Sophie. No! I saw you kissing in the pool. What, no, she tried to kiss me. I didn't want that, I had to push her off. Really? It's 100% not what you think. 100% not. She is a fast peer. Ronnie, come with me, the others can catch us up. Jeff, can you take my suitcase out for me? I wanna change my shoes. Actually, you know what? I don't wanna walk. We can wait here, if you want to. Don't you want me to come? Can we stop this, Sophie? Stop what? The flirting stuff. It's not good, let's stop it, yeah? I see. Ronnie doesn't want us to be friends. She's jealous because you like me. I do not, not like that. And she doesn't respect me, even though I'm a qualified lawyer and she's a cook. Ronnie's a chef, Sophie, and one of the best. Look, this is on me. I shouldn't have led you on. You mean in the pool when you kissed me? Mate, you forced yourself on me, which was not cool, that was not cool at all. You wanna fuck me. You're a lunatic. I absolutely do not wanna fuck you, ever. Rude. That's quite a hike. I don't think Sophie's gonna make it up here. Sophie, right. Henry, I need some time to... What? Well, before I move to London. London. I just need some time to sort some things out. You understand that, right? Right. I have some incredible news. The Lister Man trilogy, I am the Lister Man. The Lister Man trilogy, graphic novel, huge, massive success. They're making three films. This is gonna be huge. Great. I'm moving to Los Angeles for the next five years. So not London? No, not London, but you must come and visit. A proper visit, right? And I'll pay for everything, it'll be business class. Hang on. I don't quite understand. What do you mean "visit"? Me and Sophie are moving to Los Angeles for the next five years for the production. Oh God, oh no, no, no, no. No, no, no, be happy for me. No! I've worked for this my entire life. I'd forgotten how eloquent you Australians can be. Fuck you, Henry. Please, let me see it. No, don't touch it! I'm sorry, you're right, I was rude, okay? Let's wipe the slate clean and start again. There's no need. Henry is not going to do your film, and just because Veronica and him were lovers doesn't make any difference. What? I can't believe I trusted you again. I must be mad. You came here at the worst time in my life, and you sensed that, and you used it because that's what you do. That is your stock in trade. You knew what you were doing and you wanted to do it. You don't care for anyone but yourself. You have no idea what it means to care for someone else. I've been on my own since I was seven years old. Oh, you poor little boy. Stop it, Ronnie. What is wrong with me? Look, you'll be all right, you'll be with Jeff. Don't you ever say his name. We don't deserve to walk in his shadow, you toxic shithead! Well, that is charming. Asshole! Do not aggress me. That is not even a verb. That is Sophie's boomerang. Give me back Sophie's boomerang. Fuck you. Do not aggress me! I am warning you... Or what? Or what? Come on. Fuck Sophie and fuck this stupid fake boomerang! No! Is that our kangaroo? Our kangaroo's back from the dead. Oh my God. Henry! Henry, are you okay? You wait there, I'm just gonna get some help, okay? We came on this horrible trip to have fun, not to be abused. My ankle is broken. I'm too hot. Let's get you to the car. - No! - Ah, that, I'll bring the car to you. No, no, no, stop! Jeff? Jeff? Help! There's a huge spider in there. He tried to kill me! Get it off, get it off, get it off, get it off! There's nothing there! He tried to squash me! - I did not! - Yes, you did! Jeff, Henry needs help. Why? That roo from yesterday. It came back and it... - Roo? It aggressed him. Aggressed? A revenge attack? Yes. Is he dead? - What? - No, no one is dead. He just bumped his head and fainted, I think. He's okay, probably. Probably? What do you mean probably? Jeff, we need to talk about Henry. We were together when he made that film here. I should've told you. - Who cares, get Henry! And I kissed him yesterday, when you were in the pool with Sophie. I'm really, really sorry. Henry's an idiot. They're both idiots. Get Henry now! If you'd told me about Henry, I never would've invited them. I know. I've ruined everything. Jeff, the restaurant's finished. I'm being evicted. What? I'm in debt, for thousands. I just thought I could keep up with it all, but the bills just kept on coming. It's over. Why didn't you say something? I haven't paid Mom's bill for months. They're moving her to another place. That's what this meeting is about, to sign the papers. There's no money, Jeff. There's nothing. I'm gonna go back to teaching full-time. Mom and Dad can help us, take care of Iris until you and I, we get back on our feet. Why are you with me? Because I love you. You shouldn't. I just thought there was something better out there for me. But it was all here. It's you. Right in front of me, the whole time, just loving the unlovable. You are the complete opposite of unlovable to me. But, Ronnie, no more secrets, okay? Okay. Jeff, I knocked Henry out with a boomerang and I blamed it on the kangaroo we nearly killed. - No. - The roo didn't do anything. I threw the boomerang and it came back and it smashed his head in. No, the boomerang actually worked? That's fucking unbelievable. Jeff, where's Veronica? I want to go to our beach. - Watch your back, Iris. - Mom! What are you doing out here? My beautiful, beautiful daughter. You having a good day? - Yes. - Come on, Iris. Good. Miss James, I need a word. Hello. Bloody hell. Iris, wanna go to the beach? - Be back soon! - Yeah. Just going to the beach. We're just going to the beach. Iris, right, good. Miss James? Miss James. Stop, stop. Okay, pull in where it's safe. There she is. She's doing very well.
