Fuck it! My bike! You're late back today. I like your jacket. Yeah, look, not tonight. What's wrong? Damn bike... Doesn't hold the road. Do I have painkillers left over? Here. Any news of the fish? They arrive Thursday, but I'm not here. Right. It'll be okay? - You're not flying Air France, I hope. - No. Good. Can't stand them. The assistant called. They'll come by Tuesday with the director for fittings, and a coach of whatever. Pain in the ass. - You called the kid's mom? - The birthday's at her place. With a magician or whatever. Cut out the whatevers. Stop at magician. I'll be going. Already? Have some chicken. My wife's waiting. She made me cheesecake. Cheesecake? She liked the shawl we got in Prague? She says it itches. It itches? It's silk. You know what she's like. It itches! You ever use that treadmill? Sure. I'm busy now but I will. It's great. Hold on... What time tomorrow? Seven a.m., as usual. About seven? No earlier? Center! Let's go! Go, Aïssa! Come on. Don't push! Great! Don't back off her. Six a.m. to midnight every day. Standing there, not moving. Outside in the rain, like guard dogs. It's inhuman. - How was your week? - Cool. - Doing what? - All week with diplomats' wives. Acting the tour guide. That's not my job. You're a chick. They won't assign you to a minister. Chick? That's one way of putting it. Just kidding, Aïssa. - Okay, Aïssa? - Sure. - You good? - Yeah. The address for tomorrow. - Okay, dress code? - Your call. He doesn't care. So you know, he's been acting up. - As in? - He bails. Skips meetings, bailed on a US movie. They're mad. He's on notice. Keep on him. Check the mail every day. Take his calls and run his schedule. Here, it's all there. What is this, babysitting or what? It's more than protection, but it has its appeal. Next film shoot's in six weeks. They'll be calling you. It all goes through you. It's your responsibility. Here. - When's your flight? - Tomorrow evening. You'll be okay? Straight up, it's weird. And it's a shitshow to organize. Documents, coffin, flights... How's your mom taking it? Bad, but we're there. Be strong. Thanks. Hold on, something for you. Any questions, text me on WhatsApp. Keep this on you. He always loses his scripts. Hello? You okay? I was asleep. I had palpitations again. Hear that? Palpitations. I told you. Treadmill and drink more water. Give me a break with your water, that's not it. It's tachycardia, that's all. Feels like checking out. I daren't sleep. I go to bed and... It's all in your mind, Georges. Monier told you. When do you get here? I said about seven. It'll be seven soon. Just get up now. Impossible. I look like a cow. No, it's very elegant. You're sure about the color? Squirrel's good. Squirrel! Ridiculous, right, Lalou? Dunno, Georges. It's a period movie. I look idiotic in this costume. - Benoît, really... - Nicolas! - Sorry? - Nicolas. Yes, Nicolas. Sorry. Can't you simplify all these layers? Precisely, Georges. That's the character. All bundled up. I'm hot. It's 1847. He's a landowner in mourning. A widower needs a shell. Then Catherine arrives and the shell cracks. Georges, may I... - Then the costume's pared down. - What's he talking about? Georges, sorry. The fencing coach's card. François Ridel. Not me, talk to Lalou. You handle it. It's crucial. The duel is the fulcrum... The fulcrum? Please! - 3-4 classes, no more. - 4-5. - Hi, Georges. - Hi! This is my friend, Annie. - Hello. - Hello, Annie. She has fluids. - Fluids? - I told you. I heal with my hands. Take a seat. For your leg. Deep breaths. Isn't it my knee that needs your fluid? It's better via the head. Via the head. I feel... Deep breaths. I feel... I don't feel anything. You good? I must be going, sorry. I felt a little bit. For the duel scene, I thought... No, really. Stop thinking. I promise you. Gotta go, I'm late. Stay. There's beef in the fridge, Nicolas. Lalou, if they're hungry... - Let me introduce you. - No time. Hello. Gotta go. Make coffee. - All right. - Okay, bye. - How old were you then? - Eight years old. Salty, were you? - An absolute terror. - Really? I even bust the collarbone of a guy who jostled my little sis. Bust it? Takes some doing. Just there. All that. I'll keep my nose clean. You better. Now that bed looks just perfect! Right, make yourself at home. - What? - Shoes. Take them off, will you? My laces. Who do you think you are? Please. - I'm going. - Yeah. See you at work. See ya. What's he doing? Come on in, fella. Don't wait outside. Fella! I see. Coffee perhaps? No, thanks. What's your name? Aïssa. Very pretty. Aïssa. Settle in up there. That's Lalou's spot. - He gave you the keys? - Yes, I have all I need. - You're a good driver? - Yes. You stop at yellow? I don't like that. Waste of time. All right. How do you know Lalou? We did our training together and go way back. That's good. It's like he's my big brother. I've had it with playing the fool. Look... We'll do all we can but... you'll have to pony up a bit. Your fee plus the expenses caused by your leaving. What? Over my dead body. Bunch of crooks! Act like cowboys, then run crying to mommy. Don't I know it. I have no money. Your next film will cover it. Nicolas Canteret called earlier. He's worried. Who's he? The director of your next film. Right. With all he's heard, he has contract amendments. Oddly, he's terrified about fencing classes. No way. Shit, I'll do his stupid classes. It's all good then. Here, taste these. A gift from Isabelle. Sometimes I wish I were dead. So they'd get off my back. Next time, we'll check the vids for her weaknesses. Here. She always sets up the same way. A hip toss. It's fast. She's quick. - Neck? - Yeah. Turn. Let go. - I'm beat. - Yeah, me too. You worked too much with Yanis. Dude's brutal, seriously. He slammed me like he gets off on it. See? The new poster's up. But I did good, it's cool. Where you going? Come on! Eddy, for fuck's sake! - Want one? - No, thanks. Yes! Let us dispense with dangerous and unnecessary commerce. Come in, it's far too cold. The air seems more mellow if my lord allows me to accompany him. What do I say then? Do you have... Do you have... no... Do you have no principles? I cannot renounce my love for you. I say that? I do. What's my line then? Boisseuil stops short. Out of breath. Pallid. Don't bother reading the directions. I cannot... Piece of shit text. Hello. Mr. Tanazaki, here to see Georges. Of course. Come in. You had a good trip? Yes. But it's grueling for them. Be sure to check water temp and pressure every day. - And keep it good and dark. - Great, okay. Thanks. Good and dark. Here... This way, I have an envelope for you. They're fish from the abyss. They live in total darkness. Beautiful, right? - No? - I don't know much about fish. You find them ugly? Kind of deformed. Deformed, maybe, but beautiful. Let's go! Wakey, wakey! C'mon, liven up! Got a note from mom? Let's scoop! Right! Left. Nice and low. Go low. Energy! Let's move! To take his measurements? I thought you had his measurements. Fine. Sometime this week? Friday afternoon? I'll... No, Friday afternoon won't work. - How about Thursday afternoon? - Nope. No, not Thursday. I'll call back after I talk to Carole and Valérie. Thanks, goodbye. Hi, I'm Pascale. I came with my intern and the fencing coach. Come in, take a seat. I'll go get him. Georges? Georges? - Sorry. - I was just leaving. Have you seen Georges? There are people to see him. He left. - Going where? - I don't know. He grabbed his coat. What's he doing? Shit! Dumb classes are a waste of time. Let me know when you leave. Your lawyer just chewed me out. So what? It's my responsibility. I promised Lalou. Responsibility? I don't need a minder. I'm not a child. Nobody's forcing you to stay. Nobody's forcing me but I like my job. I like doing it well. I don't. I like being a fucker. The ceremony went well? Yeah. - Is it hot? - At least 30°C. Horrible! - When are you back? - I told you 100 times. Late this month. - You're eating well? - It's all I do. Lucky you. How long have you lived here? Nearly two years. - Here. - Thanks. How's it going with the actor? Just fine. He's a funny dude but I like him. Where's he live? What's his place like? I won't talk. You won't talk? A chick? Crazy-ass whips? Maseratis? Bugattis? Solid gold potties? I won't talk. I broke my back from all the standing. Where? ExpoPark, ma'am. What? Babycare trade show. I can see you working buggy security. It was worse. A whole day of reusable diapers and... a massage demonstration on fake babies. What do you mean? Plastic babies. But the masseuse was... She was scary, totally weirded me out. I kept looking at her, thinking... I know her. Suddenly, flash... Sandrine Botte! That's Sandrine Botte! Clocked ya, Sandrine! She was at high school up north with me. She was a goth. A real goth. Came to school in a cape or something. Liar. Straight up. She killed it in math. We called her Queen of Science. And then... She's massaging babies at Baby Expo. Bizarre shit happens in life. Very bizarre. There we go. I've got my son this weekend. His mother says no motorcycles. Don't worry, I'm picking him up. Straighten up. How old are you? 24, going on 25. - My daughter called, she says hi. - Right. - She's still in Berlin? - Yup. Working in PR. You go to see her? No, it's a city I hate. Berlin. That's good, really good. You need to be patient now... It needs to dry. I gotta be quick. Great. I know you go quickly. Quit moving. You'd make it much easier for me. I must have worms. Nearly done. Usually, it puts me to sleep. Sleep, if you're tired. Stop that, you'll get me in trouble. You ready? You got the official schedule? Sure. If we both make the championships in Belgrade, it'd be crazy. It'd be cool. You don't look thrilled. Sure I am. What's up? What's with the bug eyes? The fazed effect's your boyfriend? I'm not fazed. He's not my boyfriend. That's the problem? No, from time to time suits me fine. Bullshit. Fuck, the mint! Know what? I figure it's your existential crisis of the mat. Knock it off. I'm not kidding. Finish your story about the bull. Yeah, the chick came at me like a bull. Built as fuck. The referee cuts in to stop her leading with her head. We're grappling on the mat, and somehow, just before the bell... She leans in real slow, you know, like super slowly. And she slips her tongue under my ear guard. - Don't believe you. - Seriously, she licks me. - You're lying. - She licks my ear. Full on. I'm startled, like... I pull back, like, wtf. The chairperson comes over at the end of the bout. And... She stares at me. Smiling. You went to see her later? No, I didn't dare. I was like a kid. Anyway, she's based in Turin, at some club there. - Who's that? - Nothing. Work. - The actor? - Yeah. No, you're a terrible liar. It's him, for real. He's weird, he bails all the time. He knows you can take him down? Good point. He's just lonely. A lonely guy. Sure. Fame fucks you up. Same for me. Back home in Râşnov, it's tough being a star! Yeah, right. Aïssa, don't you get vertigo? I like being high up. It's restful. It's mad high. A gust of wind and boom! You fall off. Unthinkable! It's too high! Here, taste it. Ask me anything you want. Help with my essay? Dream on. Keep barking, you've got the wrong tree. Last time, for your commentary, did I get a thank-you? - Zip. - I gave you a flower. A tulip you found on the ground. So? It's still a flower. Anyway, I'm busy training. Instead of working out, help me. It's ugly, deforms the body. No, you go ahead, I'll walk. No, I'll drive you. No, it's fine. I'll walk. So, goodnight! What did you do? What was that? - Beat it! - Get up! - You okay? - Yeah. I'm okay. I'll get you home. I'd appreciate it. Holy shit! Damn eco-warriors! We'll call the police. Definitely not the cops. They're useless! Gotta check if they're prowling outside. You bet they're prowling! Everybody prowls. This bizarre feeling that I'm alone I should be going. You'll be okay? You gave that guy a good whack. Would you teach me a hold? It's late. No, I'm serious. Show me. What's your favorite? A rabbit punch? That Mossad thing? What's it called? Show me. No. Show me. Come on, show me just... Sorry. No, it's my... Sorry. It's the drink. Get some sleep. Come on. Winded me. You're strong. Careful. Anubis, Horus, Osiris, Isis, Sekhmet... So you like ancient Egypt? - Yes! - Seriously? I love it! Specially Anubis. The god with the head of a jackal. It wasn't humans that made the mummies. Actually, it wasn't Anubis who made them. It was Isis. She got help from Anubis. But the souls of the deceased, in ancient Egypt, in ancient times, they woke them up, raised their hand, and the ghost appeared. And they went into the underground world. How's my little Gabi? Good! - Were you a good boy? - Yes. That's great. Come here, I have something to show you. Let's see if he loves you. Let's see... if he loves you. Looks like it. He poked his tongue out. Let me see. Sweet little baby, aren't you? You want him? Let me look. He's happy with you. There's one coming your way. - This one's good. - He wants food. - He wants? - Food! F-o-o-d. You never heard of food? You eat food non-stop. You're a greedy-guts. I know. I took his stuff upstairs. His mother said he has homework to do. You're going? Yes, soon. Can't you stay? Because... Alone with Gabi, I'm overrun. You brought pj's? No. Did you bring pj's? Yes. The one with the planets. I'll have to leave early. For practice. Wrestling? That's why you're... Yes. Okay! Gabriel! There we are, a lovely roast! Help yourself. It'll do you good. For practice. I'm not tugging. It's the comb. You have beautiful hair. That's good. Hair like your mother's. - Thank you. - Let's see. Show me your forehead. A changed man! Hang on, hold this. Fu... sion! Now then... Catherine, let us dispense with dangerous and unnecessary commerce. Come in. It's far too cold. I cannot renounce my love for you. I'm falling. Stand up, I beg of you. Perhaps, at the end of the road, our paths will cross once more. My soul, once so tranquil... My hands, which worked with dignity... What has become of them? So here I am, vanquished, timid and enslaved... So here I am, vanquished, timid and enslaved. Like a child. Lord, help me. Help me, I beseech you. I want to dig the earth and lie there forever. Good. You've got it. Heavy-going, don't you think? I don't know anything about scripts. Of course, your thing is security. That's right. Don't you want anything else? What's your goal in life? This. Close protection. Really? Securing perimeters and... All that, right? You act, I secure perimeters. Wrestling isn't too hard? I mean, for your body. The impacts and everything. No, it's well regulated. Sometimes, it's like a dance. Well... I'll let you get some sleep. I'll watch my documentaries. Thank you. Wanna meet up? Can't tonight Too bad. What are you up to? Working - Sorry, did I wake you? - No. Tachycardia. Feels like I'm dying. Breathe. Breathe! I can't. Let yourself go. I feel better. You've seen a doctor? Yes. Yes, Abastano comes by when something's wrong. He says it's nothing. Just worry. Thank you. Sorry for waking you. No problem. He's pushing it, all weekend. No, it was fun. We went to a breeder's to buy ham and a dog. Ham and a dog? Yeah. A dog for his son. A gift. The strawberries are good. When I arrive at his place, it's like another planet. It's odd. I never saw anything like it. Strawberry, please. Thanks. Stay over, if you want. Be sure of my love. Be sure... Be sure of my love. Do you work out? Sometimes. Anyway, it's a breakup scene, so hardly... Be sure... Sorry. Be sure of my love. She's angry, hurt, but she loves him. Breakups. That speaks to you? Yes, I guess. Good. You can use it for the scene. Even so, she must have guts to leave him, so it's... It could be even more complex. She's... She's distressed. There's real intensity, I think. As well as, maybe... We don't know, but let's call it anger. - She's angry or maybe... - Horrible. She can be in a rage, supreme anger. Something we'll barely hear. It could be all that at once. Let's not overthink it. Let's go and see what happens. We'll talk later. Closer. A bit more. Georges, over there. That's right. Farther. All right, let's go. I don't say Action. Let's go. Nice and cruel. Go. They're waiting. - Be sure... - No. No, not with your back to him. Back up. Georges, toward me. No, you... That's right, forward. Now you stay... Great, that's really good. Let's go. Go. They're waiting. - Be sure... - No. No. No! No, I'm saying no. - You're like No! - No! - Good. - Go. They're waiting. - Be sure... - No! Be sure of my love. - There's two? - Way, way off, I think... In terms of energy for this scene. I owe them money. The insurance people. - I'm sick of it. - No worries. Okay, deep breaths together. Really together. That's right. Very good, now the lines. Let's go. Yes, that's it. Yes! Go. They're waiting. - Be sure... - No! - Be sure of my love. - You don't love me. - Yes, good! - No! No way! If it's good, I keep going. Go. They're waiting. - Be sure... - No! - Be sure of my love. - No! No, you don't love me. You're a scholar whose shriveled heart has bruised mine. I'm not a woman who waits till nightfall for consideration. Go now, I said. Disappear. - Disappear. - That's interesting when you... Very interesting, to inhale her. Not what we discussed, but interesting. Don't do it but it's... great. All good? Yes, it's my coach. We... We have a match later. I can't be late. Can I come? I don't know if it's a good idea. It's a peculiar atmosphere. People will recognize you. That doesn't matter. Got butterflies? Yeah, a bit. I understand. I don't get stage fright anymore, but when I did, what helped was... Repeating a phrase like a mantra. - Really? - Yeah. One of my favorites was, Wealthy only in my tranquil eyes. I'd keep repeating it, Wealthy only in my tranquil eyes. Wealthy only in my tranquil eyes. Wealthy only in my tranquil eyes. Center! Let's go! Center! Look, I got a selfie with your actor. - That goes straight to my mom. - You. He was in awe. He said he'd wait... Got your head in the clouds? What the heck? Where's your rage now? What's with the slow dance? - I'm sorry. - You're sorry? That's all you have to say? It's funny? No. A fantastic opportunity wasted. Pisses me off. It sucks. What happens to him during shoots? I dunno. I'll take him with me. Pain in the ass, her refusing to keep him. Maybe she can't look after him. You're joking! This heat! The air seems to me more mellow if my lord allows me to accompany him. You have no principles. I cannot renounce my love for you. I'm falling. Without renouncing my love, I shall renounce my temerity. You know it by heart? How about you take my place? Perhaps, at the end of the road, our paths will cross once more. So here I am, vanquished, timid and enslaved... Like a child. I'm enjoying the fish. Hôtel du Lac? Is that close to the location? Great. Garden view, yes, that's good. Just fine. Great, got it. No problem, I'll tell Lalou. Thanks, bye. All good. I spoke with the assistant. Tomorrow's confirmed. Fencing with Ridel. The guy's coming about the gate at 10. All right. - May I? - Of course, go right ahead. You got a ticket. I said you were with him. They didn't listen. Now, Georges, en garde. Please. Rotate your hand, nails pointing up. Bend your knees slightly. Open the rear hand. Thank you. And hold it. So, tip under my blade, lunge and strike. Here. Precision, please, Georges. Again. Be proud! Run the tip underneath to strike. Underneath, Georges. Hold the grip as if you were holding a bird. Just enough not to crush it. - A bird? - Firmly enough to control the weapon. Yes, but firmly... I ache all over firmly! Bonehead! For the burn. Okay? Eric's making me team leader next month. No way. That's so cool. Who's the client? A politician. Congrats. Your mouth's not on fire? Sure, a bit. No! Not water. Whatever you do. You'll make it worse. - You're sure? - Yup. Pick up if you want. No, it's cool. Work. Hi, I'm not interrupting? Actually, I'm having dinner. I can't find the house keys. Where are you? Far. In the 20th. What's the address? I'll drop by for the keys. Chez Jade, 35, Rue Bellegrand. On my way. He's lost his keys, he's coming by. Coming here? He's on you 24/7. Kinda stabbed it. Not a full squeeze, there's some stab. I was intimidated by the... What is it again? A roll? A role? A raul? What is it? Look, there he is. That's him? Can I help you? I'm meeting friends over there. Thanks. Hello there. Hello. Sorry to crash your dinner. No, it's no problem. - All good? - All good. What are you eating? We're eating steamed dumplings. Here, your keys. Thank you. I'll sit down a second. So, you... What do you do? I'm a security guard. You too? The perimeter. So you're coworkers. Yeah, that's right. Coworkers' dinner. Would you like a drink, sir? That's a pretty pendant. Is it gold? No, it's not gold. A gift from your boyfriend? My ex-boyfriend. What a goon! He gives and goes. And it's not even gold. Men! - Can I get a beer? - Of course. Shouldn't you be going? Sure, I'll leave you two. A quick drink for my throat and I'll go. Curiously, when I was 20, I lived near here. I haven't been back for years. Yes, it's... There we are. Thank you. So... Security guard? Yes. With Global Protec. Global Protec? You love her? What is this? Who? You know. You love her? He won't answer you. It's just a question. Do you love her? It's not a trick question. It's simple. This is stupid, all right. "Stupid" is no answer. What are you trying to do? If you want a dumpling, here you go. Okay, stop. Answer me. Do you love her? Yes or no? You don't love her. And you know it full well. You don't love her. You can't love. Your drunken rambling's pathetic. Your rambling's pathetic. Beat it! You don't know what love is. Love is something you earn. It's bigger than anything. Bigger than your dinky muscles. Bigger than your selfish little urges. Love's the cosmos. No... Enough, beat it. No. I like it here. I'll stay a bit longer. - It's on me. - No, come on, forget it. - Aïssa... - No, it's on me. I know he doesn't love me. What are you thinking? I know it. I just don't need to hear it. And I don't need you. Do you know what love is? Can you love? You've reached Sofia's voicemail. Leave a message. Yes, it's me. I was wondering how Gabriel is. And you, how are you? All my love. All right? Can I buy you a drink? Yes! Wait, let me grab my papers. So, here goes. Go ahead, I'm all ears. In my darkened living room, the man appeared on screen. He appeared, then he disappeared. His eyes shining like two headlights in the black night of my daily life. Life constantly repeated. Dress, brush, calm, treat. I work with horses, that's why. Veterinarian. The children have grown. Men have deserted my life. Not him. There he is, on screen. He appears, then disappears. He'll reappear with eyes like two headlights. Perhaps, one day, at a junction in the road, in the trough of a wave, in the shade of a great oak, he'll be there. Stepping out of the screen, he'll be even more handsome. His eyes even more luminous. His arms more enveloping. I'll see him. I'll stop next to him. And at last, I can breathe. It's beautiful. Beautiful. Thank you. What matters is all that's unsaid, I find. I also prefer silence. I think sharing silence with someone is real love. That's good. Can we try a silence now? Here and now, yes. Georges! Georges! Georges, open up! Georges! Fuck! I thought you were dead. I thought so too. You resuscitated me all right. Don't cry. You need to wear a suit. Yes, you're right. As you know, we don't agree with the arrangements. My client here doesn't accept the terms and the conditions... I think is a pretty fare deal considering your client cost too much problems. Hold on, I've changed my mind. Give me the papers. I will sign them. I don't care... It isn't in your best interest. Read it. I can't read this. - I sign here? - And initial every page. Initials, yes. So you speak French. Initials. That gets it over with. Screw it! Nothing to wet my finger. And sign there. Just there. There we go. Thank you. Your tickets! What tickets? For the shoot. You're not coming with me? No, Lalou is. Lalou... What will you do now? My next assignment's a young politician. A member of parliament. Good. He proposed a law against beef cattle. That's dumb. France without meat isn't France. Yeah. It's my first time as team leader. Here we go again. My heart... Breathe. Keep breathing. Won't you keep me a bit longer? Sorry about the other night. I'll get over it. Good! Don't let her grab you. Back up. Back to the center. All right, ready... Let's go. Okay, on the attack. Nour, strong stance. That's right! Use her strength. Push! Push with your feet. Keep her... That's right! Stay in the center. Not long left now. Keep fighting, girls! That's right. Push! Push with your feet. Resist her. Very good! Good. Now go sit down. We'll see later. Next week, Aïssa will take training. Okay? So watch out. Wanna see me take her down? Pascale, this is Hugues. So, I found the dog, but no sign of him. Copy that. Check the food truck. Maybe he's still there. Check the trailers too. What's wrong? There you are. We've looked all over. I was taking a leak. Pascale, this is Emilie. We're good, found him. They're ready. They're not. See, I'm not late. Look! What the hell! - Are you okay? - Sure. We're good to go. We're not. I see them changing it. Cinema eats your brain. Watch the wind with that smoke. Georges, I found your dog. You'll get a tasty treat at crafty. Wait for daddy. Go on. Hey, Tufty. Hi, Georges. Okay, Georges? - Fine. - Pascale ran through it? Yes, she talked me through it. I pretty much got it. - What have you got on there? - The fifty. So you don't see the belt? I can unbuckle. Can't breathe. - I'll get your jacket. - Not now. Your cravat, at least. Can you even see? Quick check. I'm too small. Okay, that's fine. - Good to go? - Yes. All right, let's go. Camera. Rolling. And perhaps... Perhaps, at the end of the road, our paths will cross once more. My soul, once so tranquil... My hands, which worked with dignity... What has become of them? So here I am, vanquished, timid and enslaved, like a child. Like a shipwrecked unbeliever, drifting on an icy sea. Here I am, like an orphan, wandering from dawn until evening, waylaid by the storm, buffeted by the wind. Lord, help me. What has become of me? Tell me who I am. I want to dig the earth and lie there forever. Cut! We'll go again. Positions, please. So here I am, vanquished, timid and enslaved like a child. Like a child. So here I am, vanquished, timid... and enslaved... So here I am... Like a child.
