Good morning, Carlos, ten days left till the president election day... Tell us, how's everything in Villahermosa this morning? Hello, good morning. We're here in El Peje'e homeland. People are very excited, victory feels quite close. We have a very strong feeling. Let's now hear from Roberto Fernández in Monterrey... Well, public opinion here is exactly the opposite... candidate Calderon has very strong support... We are definitely living in a divided country. Give us a call and freely express your opinion, or send us an e/mail... Today is Friday June 23rd, skies are clear... temperature will be 33 degrees in downtown Mexico City. LOVE ON A WEEKEND Oaxaco, wake up, asshole! Where did you sleep last night? Don't think I didn't notice that you didn't come home. It's none of your business. You were with that fucking Oaxaco, weren't you? I told you I don't want to see you with that indian. And I told you that you're not gonna mess with me ever again. You fucking slut! -What's up, Julie? -What's up? Give me some of that hundred pesos juice, bro. Without pulp? You know, no pulp at all, bro. Message to Mexico from López Obrador. First of all, no more debts for Mexico... we'll have more money because we'll have an honest government... Good morning you two! How are you today? My Lolita, what have you done to Paquito? I'll change your water, put on birdseed... Thank heavens the "Maestro" finally shut up. He's been playing since sunrise. Don't miss the world cup match Mexico vs. Argentina... I can't afford the SUV bill for this month. We can't miss the game. What time? I'm telling you that I don't have money to pay the SUV, Hector. The truth is, we should return it. The money you give me is not enough. What if we return the SUV? Get a smaller car, cheaper and we'll have some extra money. I don't know. Let's see. Felipe Calderon, President of Employment. We will give you credit so you can start your own business. I have to go to the agency. If it wasn't the agency it would be your family or something else. Do you really want to keep on going with the same thing? We have discussed it all night long, Ana. I don't know how to tell you this, Luis. My body can't stand it! And neither do we... Yes. Aunt Marieta! Why don't you come to Mexico? So you can at least get out of that town. Again with the same thing. The kids will come, whenever they have to come. This weekend in Acapulco. Yes. Right now. I'm going to the spa. No, the spa. Forget it, aunt, I'll explain it to you some other time. Yes, lots of kisses for you too. You too. You'll do just fine with Roberto Madrazo! An orange juice, please. -Here it is. Thank you. Cheap, cheap, cheap movies, come and get your movies, take a look. Calm down! I didn't do anything! Get out you filthy bastards. These streets are already owned. I said go! Call Yolanda, Oaxaco, they are coming to fuck us up! Where do you think you're going? Go back to the stand. I don't wanna hear you've been whoring around. Get the stuff. Go, go! Betting on something different is going backwards, let's defend what we have accomplished. Enterprises Consultant Counsel. The campaign of fear has been very successful. At just 9 days since the elections, the triumph of candidate Calderon is irrefutable. I wouldn't be that confident. -Look... -Allow me. I respect your opinion but let me tell you something, with polls or without them, we're going to win. The election on July 2nd has been already decided. We would rather concentrate on what comes next, we're going to need a very aggressive campaign to legitimize the elected President. Mr. Antonio, this country is never going to change. Hello? No, no, they don't live here anymore. Yes, I know them. I am just here at the house. Look, the truth is that you better not call again, because... All right, thanks. You have something else. I'm pregnant, aunt. Jesus Christ! It couldn't be any other way, all of us living together and the way you dress. Holy Moses! It's just that your father and brother are animals. Let's do something. There's no room in here for a baby. And it would be a shame. Do you have money? Sofia...? You going away to sail on the Semper Fides without telling me, is reason enough for me to be upset, right mom? Well, me too. I know that my brother is under a lot of stress, but I'm a part of this too. No! You always use your grandchildren as an excuse! No, it's all right, let it go. No, just go and have a good time. Joaco, the coin is in the air. That worries me. Don't be, there are a lot of people working on that. What does your brother say about all of this? What I just told you. The second of July is already fixed. Are you ready for Acapulco? Ready. Anything to see your Teresa in a thong. Oh, come on! We deserve it, right? And I'm serious about your promotion. I've got to go. We'll talk later about your new position. Good luck. Hi, sweetie! What's up? Really? What position? But it's gonna to be Miami, right? Sweetie, I'll see you in a little bit. And congratulations. Me too. Bye. Sorry miss, I'm very sorry. Stupid asshole! Ana, how come you didn't tell me before? Those treatments are very aggressive... just hormones. The truth is, I feel lighter, Aurora. We have been trying to get pregnant for a year. Your skin is going to thank you right away. Now it's a different problem. Luis is not taking it very well. Ana, do as I say, just focus on enjoyment. Luis told me that he wants to see you in a thong. Oh, really? -What about you? -What? What do you want? I want you. Alejandra is the real deal. it's better than being alone, besides, she has tons of Chinese merchandise. And how much do we have to give her? At least 300 pesos, but the more you give, the better. We have the support from three out of the five groups. It's time to take what is ours. The streets belong to those working on them! Things are about to change in this country! Two weeks, comrades. Do you have balls for this or not? Yeah! Hello? Aurorita! Daughter! How are you? What a surprise. I'm the same, you know, struggling with my students at the conservatory. There is no way that music... Yes, honey, I know what day today is. The movers? Don't worry. There won't be anymore calls from lawyers. Everything is ready to go, Aurorita. I swear, daughter. No, no, how come? Look, I've found a little apartment around here so between today and tomorrow, I will finish moving. Yes, dear. Yes, I know that. Your place is out of the question. Sure, I'll call you if I need anything. Don't worry. OK. Take care. If by tomorrow the storage is full, with my boys, we're gonna take the merchandise out. That is how things can be done, ma'am. But... Open it. Let me tell you something. I care a lot about my people. You don't mess with my people. No, no, no. We agree on that. They know about this deal. And they are ready to do it. Now it's just a matter of you keeping your word. Come on, Alejandra! I'm just telling you, my people are feeling brave. They think "El Peje" is gonna be President and things are gonna change. They shouldn't daydream. Here, things are what they are. Goddammit! This asshole shook it. Candidates, please! This is not a market. Set the right example! Luis, all I'm asking is for a break. Those treatments are very strong. It'll be good for us, honey. The SUV that Luis got for Ana is a sweet ride, right? You think? I'm in with Alejandra. You know your business. Let's hope she doesn't fool you. What are you doing? I'm just looking. That's a picture of my brother in Chicago. We should go there. Good night. -Hi, kids. -Hi. -Sebastian. -Good night. -You get older by the day. -Yes, sir. How are you? Good night. Ana, why don't you show them their room. Tomorrow we're throwing a party, I want everything installed upstairs. And move those plants. What if... we were to put a kid in danger? What kid? A little one that is ours. No way, I'd rather raise him in my hometown. Are we having one? No. I mean if it happens... How gorgeous! Thank you. What would you like to drink? Same as you, I'm willing to take the risk. Martini. -Do you like boats? -I love them! Look... Look at this. This is the biggest we own. The Semper Fides. This is me on a friend's boat in Greece. And who are they? That's my brother at a regatta. How's it going guys? I can tell Teresa loves boats. And I want to please her in every way. So, on Sunday... to the sea! Okay. Where's your sister? Who knows. My guess is that she's with that Oaxaco indian. The kid who used to sell booklets of traffic regulations. Lupita, good night. How's Mr. Genaro doing? You better stop it, tomorrow is Saturday. -It's hot, right? -Yes. How many kids do these people have? Who knows! These people have kids to make them work. But what I'm seeing here is a tribe. Did you enjoy the wine? Very tasty. It's from my town. Of course, it had to be, it's delicious. Here there's no wine production like this. Come with me, Joaquin. To Spain! Olé! Over the past ten years, the country has created the mechanisms and institutions necessary so that every day more small businessmen emerge and build a secure future for their kids. That is the big step for Mexico. Where are you going? Héctor, I'm talking to you. Héctor! -Good night. -Good night. Didn't you find it hard to leave Spain for Mexico? Just look. How's the view? Amazing, really amazing. I asked the landscaper to remove those palms, but she wouldn't. Let's cut the crap and move on to the dessert. Oh, gourmet dessert! I'll have some too. You don't know how much I needed to relax. What if besides relaxing, we also have fun? What about your guests? With them. Come with me, let's slip into something more appropriate. Do you like me? You're quite pretty, Teresa. Come here. You were right, but what did you think when... Do you have a drink for me? Your wife talked me into it. Shall we dance? Hold it! I'm home. You scared the hell out of me, kid. Were you fucking around? No, of course not. Go to sleep, we have to be at the hospital early tomorrow. Aunt, does it hurt? Go to bed! Come on, Julian, it's time to hit the streets. Wake up your sister. She's not here. Accomplishment is my strength... Thank you for your attention. What are you looking for? Goddamn witch. Always sticking your nose in things. Wake up your niece, it's time to work. Wait. You better let the kid get some rest. Last night, while you were getting drunk, she was burning with fever. Hurry up, it's getting late. Where's my sister? -Hold it! What's up? -Forget about her! Here you have your merchandise. Yesterday, some of our comrades were beaten like dogs. Those sons of bitches who think they own the streets, protected by the old political structures. You must understand that under these circumstances, I can't give you the merchandise. They would take it away from you at the first chance. First of all we have to earn our space! Let's defend the bread of our family. Over here, comrades. Let's go, comrades. With courage! Let's see, hold on... please, don't go "Paquito". Paquito, hold on. Come here, don't go. Oh my God! Stay still, don't move. Where did you decide to go! I'm coming! Look, the truth is that I'm sorry, I wouldn't come here to bother you. No, no, it's all right. No, seriously, I wouldn't come knocking on your door if it wasn't because... Paco escaped and... may I? Come in, come in. But who's Paco? It's my little bird, it's a canary. I have two of them. He flew... There he is. I'm so sorry. Wait... Forgive me. -Here he is. -Forgive me. -Are you hurt? -No -Paquito, just wait. -Got you. I'm so sorry, look at the mess I made. Hey, no worries. -Thanks. -Here's Paquito, safe and sound. Paquito! I'm gonna kill you. Let's see, hold on. Thanks. Well, thank you very much. Please, stay for a little while. No, no, thanks a lot. I have to go. Sofia... please! I didn't expect things to go like this. Let's not talk about it. I'm leaving now, excuse me. Thanks, but I really don't want to talk. Can you open the door for me, please? Thanks a lot. Hello, honey. Assholes! MORE MIGRATION TO THE US IF "EL PEJE" WINS: Did you rest? So so. What about you? Fine, why? What do you mean "why"? Luis, relax, will you? Hello, you two. Hi, guys. Having breakfast? Good morning. Such a beautiful day, right? What are the plans for today? Tennis. No, how are we supposed to play with this hangover from hell? Sweating is the best way to get rid of it. I don't think tennis is the best idea. Maybe something more calm. More calm than tennis? Yes, tennis! I'll play with Luis. Well, I'll get the gear. Time to go. You can't hesitate on this. We'll play five sets. I'll give you a one set advantage. I'd rather be having a beer than sweating here. How are you? Spending the money already? What are you going to buy? I left your savings yesterday, with your husband. Did you get it? He didn't give it to you. Oh my God. Well, I have to go, I'm in such a hurry. Have a nice day, Norita. Set. -Your turn. -Good! Good! Good morning! Damn. What money did you use for partying last night? Here we go again! Nora gave you something for me, right? Yes, money that you were going to hide. Those are my savings. Savings from my money. So I don't deserve it even though I'm your maid, huh? Are you gonna start playing the victim? What happened to the SUV? With what? You don't even remember. Héctor, that van will be the end of us. Don't you hear the answering machine? They are coming to take it! Are you all right, honey? Yes, it's nothing. -Maybe we should stop here. -Yes! We had it, OK? And it's getting late! We need to set everything for the party. Come on! No, no... we have to stop. All right, but it's our victory. Yeah, fine. I'll go ahead. Sebastian, that's not the place for that. Yes, sir. But move everything, I told you before. Yes, sir. Be careful. How's that going? Hurry up. Let's go. We're gonna kick ass. It's on. Go home, kiddo. Don't you hush me. Help! Come on motherfucker! Fetch some water! Help! The horses, the horses, let's go. Run! Let me go, let me go. Help! Yolanda, go home, I'll go with your father. And stay put till I get there! Help, please! Help! I've found your little show at the tennis court ridiculous. On the other hand, I enjoyed it very much. Of course. You don't even have to tell me. What do you mean? I think you're showing off a little too much. I think if you act a bit less spoiled, everything will be better. What about you, asshole? Have you forgotten that Ana is is your boss' wife? What game are you playing? Come here. I know what's best for us, OK? -Are you sure? -Positive And it's for our own sake. Compadre, let's go home to watch the game. Go ahead, I'll meet you there, compadre. -We are missing the mushrooms. -Yes, ma'am. I ordered them yesterday. Everything is good in here, right? What's up? How are you? I'm so glad you came. How could I miss this match at my compadre's? -Today we will kill. -Hell yeah. -Hello, gorgeous. -How are you? So what will it be, Miami, LA? I don't know. We haven't talk about it. But I'm not worried, he knows my potential, he trusts me, so the best will happen. But if I were to choose, we'll be off to Miami, right cutie? -Do you want...? -No, thanks. There you go. ...national Mexican team... Come on. Thanks. Ana, look who's here. It's Robert, my father's friend that I told you about. Ana de la Sierra, my wife. I've heard a lot about your beauty. A pleasure. Robert and my father sailed a lot together. Once, they went sailing in the Shadow Sea... Goal, goal, goal! Sofia. You scared me. Forgive me. Forgive me. I'm sorry. Sofia. Forgive me. I'm sorry. Why don't you come to my place to watch the game? I don't like soccer. Neither do I, but it's Mexico. Osvaldo Sánchez, attention! Danger, danger! Crespo... goal! The same shit as usual. You don't know how much I regret everything that happened. But, all these years... Why did you stop talking to me? I felt guilty and it was ugly, right? Your wife found out and... I would have left with you but... Aurora's illness... It's not right to be up here all alone. I'm sorry about earlier, I was feeling bad and... No, thank you. Seriously. They are tired and nervous, overtime is always very hard... What is going on here? Come and help because Lupe is coming with Mr. Genaro. From the right side Maxi Rodriguez... Attention, Maxi is coming... Maxi . He stops it with his chest. Maxi, goal! Goal! It is always the same with the Mexican team in the World Cup! And you don't have kids, right? No. I'm worried by today's events. Look, I've told you already, we are on the same page, we want the merchandise out there. But in Coyuya, there are so many interests. You follow me? Look, the elections are next week and those interests are going to hell. People have been pissed off for a very long time now. The time has come. Maybe or maybe not. Look, we know that we are the third choice but between sellers, loyalty is forever. Besides, I don't see Coyuya changing leadership And even less, after what happened today. I think you're playing with fire and you think I'm not aware. Be reasonable, Alejandra. The staff members I represent are still interested in doing business. The merchandise needs to be on the streets, that's the most important thing, not the stands at Coyuya. Do you promise that no one will mess with my people? Yes, I can guarantee that. Well, like you said, there's always more streets to run and not everybody wants the greater good of the whole. There was a fight outside the metro. Fucking Alejandra. Why didn't you go to work? I got my period. I was deceived. Let's get out of here Martin. Fucking Argentinians. That bastard has luck. Hell yeah. -Another one? -Please, compadre. For the sadness. Another round, please. The Beethoven from Iztapalapa. Fuck, I have no luck. Don't be ashamed, I can keep the secret. Take it... Or do you want to drink something? Hold it, don't you dare choke on me. Take it easy, compadre. See you later. Listen, compadre... Now that trust has been established, I've been meaning to tell you something. Why don't you stop with your fucking music in the mornings? Let's keep the spirits up. Gather around, I need to make an announcement. If there's one person who has been fighting by my side like a tiger, to defend the agency... that is Joaquin Adrian. Yes, brother. Come here. Let's put a smile on that face. I want to announce that I've decided to name him CEO of our branch in Caracas. I'm convinced that with his skills and professionalism, he'll be able to consolidate our agency in the South American market. How's that? Come to Papa. Hug me. You deserve it. By the way, where is little Yolanda? Julian, where's your sister? I've already told you. Where have you been? Your father was asking for you. I just went out for fresh air. Fresh air... There is gossip that you are involved with one of those fuckers that came to destroy the stands. Hopefully your dad won't find out. Because nobody could save you from this. Understand? I'm home, darling. I adore Joaquín. And Luis... Luis has his charm too, huh? Even though, of course, he is a... more complex man. He has so many responsibilities, but you already know that. How do you think this house and everything else is maintained? I thought this house was the property of your in-laws. Luis is very special. Yes. Yes, very special... and fast. At everything. Be careful, will you? Have a good time. Let's see how long you can last! Wait a minute. I'll be right back. If you want we can meet during the week. No, I don't think I can. Did you see the way I beat the crap out of that indian? I'm gonna take everybody off of my streets. Lay down. Now I'll show you. Can you get me a drink? No, not like this. Luis, not this way. No, not like this! Dude! Message for Mexico from Andrés Manuel López Obrador. Your niece isn't here, where is she? Check to see if you're missing anything. -Where's your sister? -Hold on! Fucking brat, she took everything. Everything? Yolanda stole my jewelry and my money. Fucking witch, you said you had no money. I told you. Go and find my compadre. He will help you find the kid. Compadre! Comadre! Why so early? You're not ready yet? For what? For the campaign closing. Well, you know, go ahead. You had breakfast? I'll have a coffee. Martín, we have to go, pick up your stuff. What happened? Everybody saw you at the big fight yesterday. My aunt knows. Let's go to my town. Nobody is gonna find us there. No Martin, let's go to Chicago instead. We will figure it out once we get there. Uncle, Yolanda is gone. -Where's my compadre? -He stayed at home with Celia. Do you know where that indian lives? Are you planning to stay the whole day in bed? We're not gonna waste a Sunday in Acapulco, are we? The sea doesn't wait for anyone. Once the ship is out, everyone not inside is fucked. Why are you looking at me that way? I couldn't even take a shit in my own toilet. Can't I use my own toilet? It's my toilet and I can't take a shit in it. You better go downstairs to get ready. Good morning, honey. Let's go. Luis woke up super furious. That fucking boat makes him crazy, right? Why did you ask him to go sailing? What a drag! We could be so much better here, laying in the sun. Where is my blue polo, honey? I told you. Hurry up. He is capable of leaving us here the whole day. I'll wait for you downstairs. Excuse me, compadre. You should come too, comadre. No, I'm not interested in politics. It's not about politics, it's about safety. No, let her be. Now that all those scumbags broke in and took everything that we've got here. God has the last word, Hector. Don't you notice something's missing? What? That the goddamn musician hasn't played the whole morning. That's true! Did you tell your wife we're not waiting for her? She's here. I told you to hurry up. This July 2nd think about your kids. Look at their faces, remember them every instant because we'll build a nation for them... Fucking brat. ...and a better life for us all... All together, towards victory! Vote for Mexico, vote for your safety. Vote for the PAN. Take a vote away from fear. Vote for your safety, vote for the PAN. Vote for the PAN, vote for your safety. What happened? Did you find her? No, but I think that fucking indian wants to take her to the other side. Let's go to the bus station. It seems like the sun will be very strong, right? Yes. You better put on some sunscreen. We can swim here. Darling! Weren't you anxious to swim? Go for it! Come on, it's gonna help your hangover. Come on, baby! We came to have a good time, OK? Let's have fun! Yes. Yes, let's have fun. What happened to you? Teresa, what happened to your eye? Luis! What happened to Teresa? I don't know. What's for lunch? Sofia. Where's your mom? Is there something to eat? Yes, I'll cook something right away. Thanks. Please, don't bother opening the door. -Yeah? -Good afternoon. We came to repossess. Repossess what? We're gonna repossess your SUV. Call me so we can go to the spa. I'll call you next week. Better call me the week after, I'm gonna be very busy. The thing is, by then we'll be in Caracas. Call me and we'll settle everything, all right? OK, goodbye. You take care. Thank you for everything. Bye. -Sofia! -How are you? Please, come in. I was waiting for you. -Yes. -Come in. -How are you? -Fine. -Sit down. -Yes. Do you want some tea? Yes, please. What kind is it? It's a mixture of chamomile and mint. -Sugar. -Thanks. -It's delicious. -Good. All these years, Andres, you don't know how good your music made me feel. All these years, I just played for the two of us. Do it. Play the violin once again, will you? Yes. Hi, Dad. What is she doing here? You didn't have enough humiliating mom? -Don't talk to me like that. -I'm sorry, I was just leaving. Do you want me to move out for you? You're leaving this afternoon, with or without your stuff. But you're leaving. I think this time I'm pregnant for real. That's the only way for Mexico... Because if one grows, we all grow together. Betting on something different is going backwards, let's defend what we have accomplished. Andrés! Andrés. I'm fed up with politicians and their fucking elections. When we get to Chicago, I'm definitely betting on something different. Do you know how to make tamales?
