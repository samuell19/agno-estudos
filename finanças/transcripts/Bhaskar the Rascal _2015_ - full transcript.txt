Don't confuse me, totally Rs.8.5 lakhs @2.5% interest, after 3 months he says it's Rs.9,15350, what about the first Rs.2 lakhs, what's the balance, it's Rs.7,15357 after 3 months... that too @ 3% interest, Rs.3.5 lakhs @ 3.5% interest. Drinking in groom's dress, sir? Go and marry! lsn't he telling you? Go! Anyway you can't avoid coming here after marriage, so first go and marry! - Go sir! First gave Rs.8.5 lakhs... After 3 months gave Rs.2 lakhs, again gave Rs.1.5 lakhs 3 months later, l returned Rs.2.5 lakhs to you immediately. That was @ 2% interest and this is @ 3% interest. Totally it is Rs.7, 97911! - No... Rocking! Great boss! Come here, you move! Sit here. What a brain and why are you here? What's this dress? - Why do you want to drink? Tell me. My ego will not agree to tell, l need a drink. Give him a bottle. Balu, a genius...a brand name! A genius...a brand name! What next? Why would l be on ground after so many firsts? Somewhere...in air... Generally l don't believe in luck, but my bad luck came in train to make me believe it. Did you see how my bad luck is? So beautiful that l don't like, so energetic to tire me out, so cute to make me angry, my father himself went to the station to receive my bad luck, Uncle! How are you dear? - Fine. Come. - Uncle! Me? Then, l'll go back. - Wait. Just for fun, l'll carry it. Uncle! Look there! Balu's photo! He's state first rank. - Very nice! Hi Balu! Grandma! Aunty! Are you preparing chicken for me? l'm grinding masala for it. Please come in, madam. This is your room but please don't go upstairs. Balu sir is very strict. Who are you? Why did you come upstairs? Who are you all? l'm fourth!- Class? - No, my name. What? That's the procedure here. No names, just ranks. Balu uncle calls us by ranks only. He has no name, yet to pass exam. How did you come here? - lt's a long story! We came here for granny's birthday, without leaving after having cake, we played cricket finding a bat here. Hit the ball into Balu's room, right here! When we asked him to return the ball, he asked how much is 2x2=?. Stop! 2x2=? 5? One more candidate! We too said 5, we are here ever since then. What about your parents? Not to come out from Balu's room till we grow up like Balu, our parents left us here and went away. Yes sister, l don't have sight problem, but since Balu has, my parents forced me to wear spectacles. But your room is great! - This room? No way, sister! We've to put on uniform in home also. l can't believe it. Sister! Don't touch anything. No sister, he'll know if you touch anything. He's a CC camera. Would he know if l close the cap? Look on the table! Sprinkling powder on mouse pad. Keeping the pen open. Keeping the book in a different angle. Changing places on chessboard All are Balu's tricks. You didn't do anything now, right? Any difference in it, we all get banged up. By the way, who are you? l'm Balu's aunt's daughter. Balu has no relatives, just ranks only. Balu will not ask how are you, he'll ask what's your rank? Balu isn't like that, l know him well. Somebody had entered my room. lt's me, Balu. Your name? You know, right? l don't remember unnecessary things. l can't waste so much memory for you. Cut it short and tell me. What's your rank? l'm first in singing. l mean in EAMCET. What's your first year's percent? lt is 55%. You know my percent? lt's 95%. That's why l've joined your college. Percentage is mine not the college's. l saw your hoarding near the railway station, it was great! See it in bus stop, it's much better. Look at the timetable. What's this dish? l can't waste so much memory for it. Cut it short. Chicken in this home, aunty? l made it especially for Mahalakshmi. No sister! - Why? This is chicken, sister. - Yes, but it isn't Saturday, right? Don't you eat on Saturday? - No l don't. Then, everyday is Saturday to you. Why? Balu hates chicken. Then, l'll go back to my place. Sister, get up! Sit down. Eat! What? Do you love non-vegetarian food? Tell me your marks percentage again. lt means second class. Did you see brainless fellows? One more example to show brain doesn't work if you eat non-veg. So, if you eat non-veg? - Brain will not work. Take away the chicken. Wait for two minutes. Mom, l'm going. Take Mahalakshmi also with you. - No way. Mr.Balu Mahendra! She's new to the college. l brought her here to study along with you. Please take her too. l'll drop her in college, mother. Let him go. You'll drop her today, will you drop her every day? Let him take her. Bring a glass of water! Drink! Keep the glass inside and come. Mahalakshmi, you wanted chicken, you want curry or fry? Some curry and some fry... Cancel it, aunty. Did l ask you to sit? Sit. Get down. Share auto will come, it'll take you to college directly. What's this? l'm relative in home but Balu in college. Yes. O God, you gave books in hands... Too bad, you gave laziness to bodies... O God, you gave million dollar syllabus... Too bad, you gave us just a milligram brain... O god, you gave one-day match... Too bad, you gave exam on same day... O God, you gave a question paper... Too bad, you gave blank answer sheet... You gave too much beauty to watch... But gave results that can't let raise our heads... Why are you playing double game with us? Why are match fixing to fail us? How? Memory card is small... memory status is vast... Though brain is just a milligram... create miracles with it... Sing formulas in bathroom instead of songs... lf you fall in love, entire syllabus will become a Swathi magazine... Well said! Numbers are totally hundreds and thousands... But the rank starts with him only... lnstead of studying from A to Z, just say B to U, that's enough... We thought of inventing bulb, but Edison spoiled it... We thought of inventing telephone, but Graham bell made the fist call... We thought of making mark at Oscar, but Rehman stole the chance from us... We aimed at least to get first rank but Balu was born for it... Edison who invented bulb, did he find medicine to study well? Had it stopped with telephone, would there be cell phones now? lf one thinks this is enough, nobody would become a hero... lf you're happy with just past, there's no future to your present... ln whatever Balu sees no logic, it's useless... Whatever it is, Balu is the centre of activity... Whatever the question is, Balu is the answer... Whichever book Balu studies, let's buy and study the same book... Let's make photocopies of the notes by Balu... Pen used by Balu, let's offer prayers to it... Let's all follow the path of Balu... Results are out, buddy. Who got the second rank? - Ajit got it. Why should l throw a party? You came first, right? Second ranker must give party here. That's the rule. lf he gives party every time for getting first rank, his dad's wealth will not last for long. 10 coffees, 10 cappuccinos... - l don't have money. Got his purse. My purse! My aunt's son! Cancel the order. l've made it a tradition to name the new block on first ranker's name. l knew you'd get first rank, so the new block in on your name. You changed the rule of first ranker not giving the party, but l wish you give a party to me. For fun, why don't you come second rank please? You can never get a party from me, sir. Why are you so dull after getting first rank? Had it been me? - What would you do? l'll say, that is Mahalakshmi! You'll never get that chance. ls she your aunt's daughter? Do you smoke cigarettes? People shouldn't think Balu gets first rank because has no bad habits. That's why l smoke. Does it smell? ls it from Roja? - How do you know? The lone girl left, read it. To future Bill Gates, your eyes are beautiful. Underline it. Your specs are good. - Underline it. But it doesn't suit you. Strike it off. Strike off the before one too. You mean your eyes are beautiful? You drive the bike stylishly. l'm underlining it. Underline it again. But it's not good to leave me alone in the bus stop. Don't use your brain, just read the letter. You said my Balu isn't like that. What happened? He left you in bus stop. He told me not to call him by relationship. lt hurt me. 2-year-old vengeance, sister. He told me to get out for blowing bike horn. My name is Subrahmanyam, how dare he calls me as ninth rank. l don't brush teeth everyday but l've to wash his bike daily. Pour water! l was like this, sister. l'm now like this. He's using my clothes now, sister. He pinched no my thigh for touching his computer. See this! What's that mark? - l made it myself lest l may forget it. Why are you silent, sister? l've lab tomorrow, l need a computer immediately. Have you forgotten it, sister? That's a first rank holder's computer. What the hell first! Should first rankers only use the computer? Sister is studying computer science, why shouldn't she use it? We want...wan want... Stop! l'll ask the computer for you, let's go sister. Don't get afraid, sister. - He may beat us. Move! l'll wake him up, sister. No, it's 5! What? l've a doubt. Actually X = 2, then Y = 3, if l substitute X = 2 in this equation... You carry on. That's circle, right? What's AE? lsn't it diameter? Telugu medium? Didn't study? You'll not study. Why should you girls study? Some guy would work hard to study and find ajob, and you marry him, you enjoy his hard work. Stop! What was that on road? On my bike? Nothing on bike... Don't act innocence. We hit a speed breaker, bike jumped on it, you fell on me, your chest touched me, you also knew it touched me, but you stayed like that only, there was difference in your breathing too, it means you felt something, since l'm mature, it's okay, had it been someone else, they would've taken advantage of the situation. You're kids, mustn't see this. Go away. Go! Did you eat chicken? Show me your hand. Oh no! l got one thing from it. Never send sister alone to Balu's room. Go! What happened? Grandma, l'll fail the exam. l didn't write well, send me back to my native place. l can't understand anything here, aunty, they teach everything in English, l can never pass. What's it? - Uncle, l'll fail. What's it dear? - l can't understand anything, uncle. end me back to my place. - Will you go back to your place? Did we bring you here all the way from there for this? Do you know how much l had to fight your father to bring you here? Please don't cry. l'll fail in the exam, uncle. Look what l've brought for you! Still l'll go away to my home, uncle. l can't understand anything here. Have some milk, dear. Don't cry, aren't you my good girl? l don't know how to pacify you. Because l don't know the pain of failing in exam. l've never failed in life. You said you're going back, is coming and going your will and wish? Anyone would fail if they don't study, why are you sad for that? Study well and write again, l'll also help you, if you fail again, l'll drop in your home myself. This is my original timetable, since l'm intelligent one hour study is enough, if l study for a hour, you've to study for 5 hours. Got it? These are my books. Study! Ask me if you've any doubts. Lord Ganesha! Bless me along with Goddess of learning... Share your wisdom of light to brighten our intelligence... Bless me great lQ to understand any lesson easily on listening... Bless me with great memory to remember anything l read once... Bless that question in exam come from what l read... Bless what l didn't read may be left in choice... Bless one mark for every time l pray... Bless me tension free concentration... Bless me a pen that doesn't stop while writing answers... Did she pass or fail? l'm sure she would've failed. - No, she would've passed. Neither she failed as he thinks nor pass as you think. Then? What happened? l had a dream. Do you know this joke? l had a dream last night. lt seems you got the first rank, entire college was congratulating, l was in splits laughing! Buddy, results are out! Who got the second rank? - You! Party? Why should l? You came second, it's rule that second ranker must give party. lsn't it? - Right! l was worried because no block ever had a girl's name other than boys, you've come like a Goddess to fulfill my wish. You've fulfilled my life ambition of getting a party from Balu. l asked you for fun to come second, but you really did it. ls it necessary to make such a big sacrifice for my sake? Here sir! ls it from Roja? How many times do l've to tell her? lts not for you but for me. Who gave it? lf he beats l'll take care. How dare you write love letter to my aunt's daughter! Get on! Will you take if anyone gives a letter? Shouldn't you've slapped him? l've become a guard to her. l'm unable to guard her. lf anything happens, she'll be fine but we'll be abused. lt seems Mahalakshmi came first this time! Some guy gave her letter and you're asking about first rank. First? My foot first! Anyone who studies will get first rank. Character is important here. Can't you understand? lt seems Mahalakshmi stood first! She has, l helped her to study, right? How can she not get? l didn't write exams well to raise her confidence. Did entire college follow you? How can he give letter unless she's lenient? lt seems he gave and she took it. l've lost my respect in college. Grandma, tell me, isn't it shame if anyone gives love letter to her? Why isn't anyone bothering about me? Leave it, l've to take care of it anyway. Why are you getting so irritated? ls it because he gave letter or l got the first rank? l think your stomach is burning, have cool drink. Who said eating chicken will affect the brain? Mother! Yes son! - Who gave password to my computer, dad? Why? You said the computer belongs to the first rank holder. You came second, so computer belongs to Mahalakshmi. Yes uncle! Please tell him the password, he's tensed. lf l tell, he'll know, l'll open it myself after finishing this leg piece. No need, what could be her password other than chicken 65! l'll open it myself. Not you...it's for 65! Poor darling, don't feel sad. Silly girl! Chicken is her world, l'm sure that'll be the password. Get out children! What are you doing here? What a great figure you have! How could Balu study with such a great beauty at home! Tell him to see you properly after wiping clean his glasses. What a waist! l can spend an entire semester just watching that one part! l think circle was found after seeing your waist. l think moon was drawn on sky after seeing your waist. l think zero was found to measure your waist. You've made me understand many secrets, yours lovingly... Aunty! l didn't do anything! Aunty! Aunty! She's telling them. What happened? Oh God! l'm finished! That is... What happened, dear? l beg you, please don't tell. Don't be afraid, what had happened? Stomach pain...no headache, l want pain balm. Pain balm? - Pain balm? That's all? Mad girl! l'll get it, wait. Take it. l'm mature, so no problem. lf not what would've happened to you? This isn't for me but for you. She software draped in a sari... She's first rank holder sporting a pony tail... She's Goddess of learning wearing high heels... She's chilly bowl in the eyes of our Balu... She made a long jump from the last to first... She's flying kiss who reached top from bottom... She's extension of sky with her long plait... She's high tension in the heart of our Balu... Brother is telling story and you're hailing the girl. Brother, don't feel bad, drink this. Drink! Brother, l've good idea for you to come first. He's telling flashback, how can he take advice? That's why l want to tell. - Let him continue, go ahead. Repeat the flashback again from the beginning, this time you must come first, brother. That's all! - Like your damn face! Don't feel bad, smoke cigarette. Sometimes Tendulkar too gets out on duck. What if gets out second time also on duck? l too had the same fear. l couldn't take it. l must top at any cost. l gave a good thought. l went to KFC. Ordered a bucket of chicken. After eating a leg piece, l got two ideas. Anytime is wartime for Tom and Jerry... Cat is cheating the mouse... - Mom, l'm going to ground. Fox is cheating the crow chick... Moustache is cheating the plait... Read the important books stealthily... Mix the subjects and make juice of syllabus... With the straw of eyes, suck it up... Ant is cheating sugar... lf your sister has brain, tell her to take out this ring. Honeybee is cheating the flower... Squirrel is cheating the guavas... What are you doing there, Kittaiah? l'm sprinkling rice to keep ghosts off, madam. Ghost? - Yes madam. A ghost with headlight roamed the entire house, madam. lt was reading English hymns, madam. Now l know why alarm time changes, why books go missing, if l'm in bathroom, door gets latched from outside, thinking about all this puts off my brain. l couldn't open this stupid ring. Yes, l too had similar experiences. Why are your eyes bloodshot like devil? How can anyone sleep with ghosts stalking us? l'm also scared of ghosts. This is a big ghost house. This is the chance, have a go at the chicken. Today is Saturday, aunty. Okay, l'll keep it in fridge. Saturday is over and Sunday is here! lt means l can eat chicken. l can smell someone studying here! ls it Balu the ghost? Ghost! l got scared thinking it was Mahalakshmi. lt means he's studying at midnight without your knowledge. lt's cheating. Leg piece saved you, sister. Don't forget it all your life. No loss if you build a temple for that leg piece. He's eating memory enhancing herbal concoction. So, that's his secret. l thought it was own brain. Useless brain! Suggest something boys! You must also disturb him, sister. Don't spare him! How you must disturb him, mustn't know one gets disturbed for this too, even kids like us mustn't get it, you must disturb him like that. Got it? Grandma... What's it boy? - Look, how she's disturbing me! She's exposing! She's a little girl!- Little girl!? ls she a little girl? Mouse is attacking the cat... Flower is attacking the thorn... Salt is attacking fire... Mom, l'm going to the ground. Aunty, me too! Got solution to criss-cross poses... and for knotty theorems... Cheat the cheater... fight for everything... Tough competition for the top rank... Fish attacking the crane... Deer attacking the tiger... Half sari attacking the jeans... Balu square into Mahalakshmi square is equal to cheating square. That's super! l'm tensed to know who came first! Tell me now, who came first, you or Mahalakshmi? Why are you late? - Today results will be out. l sought grandma's blessings. l've a sentiment that if l do like that l'll come first. Get on. Do the old woman's legs really have so much power? May be...why not take chances? Get down...get down. Hold it, l'll be back in a second. Where are the legs? l can't see them! Balu Mahendra has sought my blessings! Sit! Father! How are you nephew? - l'm fine uncle. Get the fruit basket from auto. - Yes sir. Aunt is making chicken specially for me. Why are you rushing for her marriage? No, got a good proposal. Very good boy. They refused dowry too. lt seems he saw Mahalakshmi somewhere and he liked her instantly, he wants to marry in a month and take her to America. You're right, uncle, fix her marriage immediately. Don't delay any further, l'm almost dying in college to protect her, she gets dozens of love letters everyday, uncle. Entire college is after her. lf you get her married you know she'll go to America, if not l'm scared where she'll go away. You keep quiet, stop your nonsense. Son-in-law, she's mother less child, that's why her uncle brought her here to study, why are you rushing for her marriage? After she finishes her studies, we'll find a better man and conduct her marriage. There's difference between marriage arranged by me and you. Anyway she's a girl, no need to study anymore. You're right again, uncle, girls mustn't pursue higher studies, if they do, their husbands can't bear them and leave them. Like how grandpa left grandma! Shut up! Mind your words! Your grandpa didn't leave me, l left your grandpa and came here. l've raised my children to this position without any support. Aruna, tell your son to keep his tongue in control. l'll take leave. - Wait, you can meet him and go. No, he'll try to change my opinion. l don't want to hurt him. Father! Groom wants to talk to you, he'll come to your college on Monday. Please wear sari on Monday. Are you studying? Why are you working so hard? Someone would work hard, find a good job and marry you, look, Mahalakshmi got herself a man without any difficulty. She's marrying next month, ask her. Girls don't need to study at all, you must go to the gym and tone up your figure, why are we boys here for? We'll do the hard work for you. l don't want to marry now, Balu. Why are you sitting dull? Results not yet announced? Announced! - Then? Tell me! Mahalakshmi... - Mahalakshmi...? She got 95%! Then for me? - You got 96%! See, l'm first! First time party for getting first rank. Give whatever they ask! Ajit has won! l was feeling sad for not having any block with 'A', but you've achieved it today. Yes buddy, Ajit got 97%! He's first! Again Balu's party? Poor boy, leave him sir. His dad might've to sell property to give parties whenever he comes second. l'll give the party this time, come and enjoy sir. First rank holder's name will be permanent on the block. lt can be Balu, Mahalakshmi or Ajit! No away, it's fixed, it'll be Ajit block First rank must be between us only! No one else must get it. Disturb Ajit's concentration. Spoil my marriage. But l've a condition. - l too have a condition. You mustn't say that is Mahalakshmi. - You mustn't ask computer password. l'm weak in embedded systems, Balu. l know, l'll help you out. You're weak in virtual reality. l know you'll help me. Suddenly if we fight and stop talking to each other. Who should speak first? Okay, heads you first and tails l'm first. No, heads you and tails me! - lmpossible! Let's spin coin to select heads and tail. lf it's heads, tails is yours and if it's tails, heads is mine. Spoil the marriage She was with in the pub till 2 am, l told Sandy told to drop after she got drunk. l don't know where he dropped her. Where are you going? What's this? Smack! Smack? Didn't Mahalakshmi send you? Do you want Mahalakshmi? You are...? Ask...ask...ask who am l? Come...come...ask this dustbin! Ask these plants! Ask anyone in this college! l'm Balu, Mahalakshmi's lover! Mahalakshmi is my life. She's my love...she's my madness... Nobody can take away Mahalakshmi from me. l'll tell you about Mahalakshmi. Don't believe anyone telling about her. She's very good girl. She's always first in class. l'm thinking of naming this block on her name. She doesn't have any bad habits. She failed in love with a boy known as Balu, poor girl was very nice, so she couldn't take it, since then she's in pubs, she has taken to drugs and drinks, l've never seen her smoking cigarettes. l too have a photo! Aren't you Prasad? l'm Mahalakshmi, my father told me, that you'd come here. l saw your photo. l'm seeing you now. l like you. No...no... Give me your number to talk to you. Spoil Ajit's life My eyes are saying l love you... My lips are saying l love you... What eyes hasn't seen and lips never said... My heart is saying that you love me... l lost it while trying to dry it in sun... Wind took my sari... lf you look at me mischievously, l feel chill... l told you to just say l love you, why did you kiss him? For l love he'll get disturbed for a month only, but for my kiss he'll get disturbed for the entire semester. Two pairs of eyes are plus... All others are minus... Equation of body multiplied by body... lt is equal to infatuation... Left angle and right angle joined together to form a new triangle... For the youth's study, this is the natural mathematical theorem... Straight line turned to create a new picture... Action moved and counter action raised to generate heat... What's this? Anyway you're matured, right? Go! Metres for distance and kilograms for weight... This couple is measure to desires... Centigrade isn't enough and Fahrenheit will not work... lt's difficult to measure the heat of youth... ln the early youth, there's no end to desires... No science can understand this... Gravitation tells anything thrown up will come down... lnfatuation makes everything topsy-turvy and upside down... The boy is South pole and the girl is North pole... They've to unite to become a couple... Boy is electron and girl is proton... lf they unite physically, it'll produce electricity... Every sensation is a question... Another question is the answer... lt's exam time for the youth... Two bookworms... Have come to age... They got intoxicated eating the sugary words... What are those clothes? Will you go out in the0m? Grandma, she's just a little girl. No problem. What? What are you watching? What's happening here? This is common. lt's there between any boy and girl. How do you all know this? Sir, we heard it many a times. Okay, we've an exam tomorrow, right? Let's study. Move...move... - Study well! This is what you call in English as combined study. lt's a theory. Son-in-law! l've a good proposal for your daughter. You can afford the proposal. Come here personally, let's discuss. lf Tom and Jerry join together who so ever it may be don't care... lf you come first, l'll tell you something. lf l come first, l'll also tell you something. What did Mahalakshmi planned to tell you? What did you want to tell her? Who came first anyway? Did you promise to tell anything if Balu comes first? Am l looking good? What are you thinking of telling him, sister? First tell me, how do l look? l'll tell you after that. Super sister! - Then l'll tell you later. Sister! You never gave any party for your son getting first rank, but why now? Wait for sometime, my brother-in-law is coming, l'll announce after he arrives. A small suspense. Didn't you get the first rank? - lsn't it enough if Balu gets? lf he gets, is it yours too? lt seems there's infatuation between them. At last got a party from you. Anyway both of you made a good plan, cheated Ajit to get the first rank. But still, he's great buddy. Though they'd planned together, he fell short by just 2% only. lf not he would've got the first rank. Why hasn't your father come yet? - He's on the way, very near. Sister, Balu wants you on terrace urgently. Okay l'll take it, you go. - Come, let's go for ice cream. Don't feel bad Ajit, winning and losing is normal in life, brush it aside and march ahead, that's all. Who is it? Didn't l give him a great shock? He would've got shocked. Should my dad sell property to throw party if l get second rank? Whatever it is, he's great! Though we had disturbed him so much, he got just 2% less than you. Thank God, we had a plan if not may be he would've topped. Our plan worked out very well, right? lf you hadn't disturbed him, l wouldn't have topped, right? Definitely, he's very intelligent! Whatever it is, Ajit is great, isn't it Mahalakshmi? Absolutely! - What about me then? You mean...? l mean if Ajit is great, what about me then? You're also great! There can't be two answers for a question. ls Ajit great or am l great? You're great! - Why that gap? Unless you think, don't you feel l'm great? Are you accepting by force? Come down to cut the cake. Everyone is happy, no need to fight now. Come and cut the cake. So, you accept to avoid fight, right? You promised to tell me something if l top. ls it this? Stop! Don't talk to me, l'm satisfied of getting first rank. l feel like it was given as alms by somebody. Your father is calling you to cut the cake. Party is cancelled, ask everyone to leave. Tell my father. l've become an idiot to everyone. ls Ajit great? How can he be great? How could get you such a thought? ls one great if he gets disturbed if someone disturbs? lf he was really intelligent, he wouldn't get disturbed even if anyone disturbs him. Didn't you disturb me with infatuation? Did l get disturbed? Did l disturb you? lf you had disturbed Ajit, it means you've disturbed me too. Are both same? - Same! lf it's same, l'm telling you now, Ajit is greater than you! - Yes! Get out from my house. Eats here but praises him. What? What did you say now? l said you eat here but praise him, so what? What's the problem, son? - Look, what is she saying? We brought you here from village, gave you boarding and lodging, paid your college fees, and she praises someone else! Ajit is great! Who the hell is he? Who is spending on whom? Uncle started business with my dad's money. Don't forget it. He's talking nonsense, you too are joining him. Look at her dad, what nonsense she's blabbering. lt seems this business belongs to them. lt seems we are living in their home. lt seems we are eating out of their hands. How dare you abuse my dad! Had he not brought you here, you'd be a maid in that place! l can live like a maid but you can't live without first rank. Yes, l can't live without first rank, but remember one thing, without us, your family can't survive. Okay, you fed me, you clothed me, and paid the fees, isn't it? l'll repay every penny with interest after getting ajob. Who will offer you ajob? When l start my company, l'll keep ajob open for you, join whenever you want to! Okay, inform me when your company is in troubles, l'll come to help you out. l'll make you say that is Mahalakshmi! - Get lost! Father! - Stop dear! When did you come, son-in-law? Please come in. - No father, let's not stay here. Please take me away with you. Brother-in-law, please come in. lt's childish fight, you please come in. No please, let's discuss later. Hey you, stop! Tell me the password and go. Please don't put interval card now! Already dying with tension. l'm also dying holding it for long. Brother! Are you fine sir? Welcome please. Stop children! Who are you? Why are you going in? Mahalakshmi's marriage, Kittaiah. Calling me by my name, who are you? How dare you ask who we are? Beating me? Who are you? - Don't you know him? He's me, l'm Nikhil! - ls it? l've become like this in 3 years. You go! This is l, Lalithya! - l'm Subrahmanyam. l'm Shravani. - l'm Roshan. ls it you children? How big you've grown up? Sister! We need to talk personally, all of you get out. How are you studying? Why are you asking like Balu, sister? Close your eyes, sister. - Why? Your favourite chicken! No please, stopped eating chicken. Have you stopped eating chicken? - Yes. What happened, sister? Did Balu say anything? l'm going to gym, tell me, l'll knock him down. Please tell us, sister! You know Balu and l had a fight then. - Yes. After that we didn't talk to each other for quite sometime. After 3 years l received a phone about grandma falling seriously ill. How is she, doctor? How are you related to the patient? She's my grandmother. - Ask him. Uncle...how's grandma? How are you? When did you come here? Tell me, how is grandma's condition, uncle? Forget about grandma, tell me how are you doing? You promised to repay money with interest, have you brought it? Leave it uncle, tell me how is grandma? What should l say? l didn't want you to remain in village and brought you here to study, will you repay with interest that too? When your mother died, it my wife who fed her milk to you, you always had to fight with Balu for it, will you repay that too with interest? Uncle... Calm down...please don't cry, dear. Grandma is fine. With your tears, you've paid the interest. Okay? Uncle! You've cried again, this time principle is also settled. Shall we meet grandma? Come...come... Do you've change for Rs.500? - No please. Got change for Rs.500? - No please. Got change for Rs.500? - No please. Nephew! - Uncle! When did you come? l didn't see you. - Don't act smart! How much you need? Rs.10, uncle. Take it. Pay it first. No problem we'll see while settling your account. Sorry, uncle. Do you want coffee, dad? We had it just now, you and Mahalakshmi have it. Go! Heads, it means you must talk to me first. But you've already talked to me. You never gave me the chance. How are you? - Not fine. Recession, lost my job. l bought a flat trusting the job, l'm unable to pay the installment, l sold off the land, and dad now stays with me here, situation is quite bad. Why are you staring at me? Won't you be happy if l say like that, right? Won't you make me happy then? Should l make you happy? Started a company last year, lost Rs.100 crores, don't have money even to shave, this is my last shirt and my grandma is ill...- Enough! Father is tensed yesterday, l bought a car and it met with an accident today. l broke up with my girl friend. - l'm very happy. Wasn't our behaviour very childish then? When l slept, you studied. - l felt jealous if get first rank. Hiding the books. Reading text books hiding inside film magazines. l challenged to make you say that's Mahalakshmi! l made an open offer ofjob to you in my company. l feel like laughing loud thinking about all that. Let's speak truth now. What are you doing? - l'm with lnfosys. l've taken a flat in Madhapur. What about you? l...you told me the truth. l can't live if l'm not number one. Last year l started a company known as Cloud Technologies, there are about 100 employees working for me now, turnover is Rs.40 crores, planning to open a branch in US... What did you say your salary was? Lowest paid employee in my company is Rs.2 lakhs. lf you need ajob at anytime... l'll offer you job immediately. lf l beg for ajob with you, you'll offer me ajob, right? l'm not what l used to be, l've changed. How am l to prove it? l accept it. Though l accepted Ajit is great, you still don't have the heart to say no, you're great! l thought you've matured with your initial talk. l know you're not matured enough to talk to me first, so l did it. You haven't changed, Balu. You too haven't changed, Mahalakshmi. You've a black Benz, right? Why did you come in white Benz? Black Benz only, painted it white fearing black may fade. lndian roads, right? You're absent minded, right? Thought you've brought someone else's car. Absent minded? Even Google may forget, l will not. - Do you remember Hyderabad? What has changed here to forget? Brother-in-law... - Greetings. Jayanthi's... - Husband! l remember him. But l don't have numbers to contact them. Please tell me your number. l can't feed lndian numbers, do it yourself. When did you buy this place? - Just 6 months back. Six months ago! Very old model! Take it. Same name not changed yet. - That's his memory! lf you've such great memory, you must recognise me then? How can l forget you? He's our...our... My son! - Yes your son. How can l forget him? He was playing with beard as a child. But l don't have numbers to contact them. Please feed your number in it. John uncle left to US when you were 4 years old. lt took me 20 years to come to lndia. Why did you take so much time? Did you walk back to lndia? Are you cracking jokes on me? You've to marry now, Surya. Surya? Who is he? Who is Surya? Have you forgotten your son's name too? Surya is you son. My name isn't Surya, uncle, my name is Balu. l fed my name wrongly to test your great memory. What's aunt's number? l know it. - His memory is in his cell phone. How are you aunt? Don't you remember me unless l fall sick? Don't say like that, aunt. All others' numbers are in this, but yours is in my brain. Had you not helped me to study, would l've gone to America? Would l've driven Benz cars? By the way, what's your problem, aunt? You didn't get heart attack even when you left uncle, but you've got it now, that means you're hiding something in heart. tell me what's that is affecting you? l'm here from US for you. Please give me a chance to repay my gratitude. That's the matter, aunt will be happy if Balu and Mahalakshmi marry. Take it as her last wish. What do you say? lf they agree, it's okay from our side. What do you say, brother-in-law? - Yes. Children! What do you say? l've a girl friend! l'm planning to marry her only. Brother! Mother, this is Swapna. Greetings aunty. - My dad.- Greetings uncle. You never told me. Your number please. Then, no need. Who is she? l told you about a girl l'll not introduce, that's her. What does your father do? - He's an auditor, uncle. Balu's taste is sensational, right? Balu's taste is great but her taste is really bad. Very cheap! He's very moody, how did you get him? Father... - Don't say like that, uncle. He would've fallen for this one word! Watch! l'll get the truth out! l need to ask few questions about your personality, your... - Height, uncle? You mean... - She's 2 inches taller than me. Now... You mean... - Rs.50000 more than mine. Look, personality means... l got it, isn't it marks? She failed in a subject. You've ashamed America. Phone number! But, 6 digits only? Wrong number. lt's not phone number but measurements of Miss lndia. How much bigger than you? Father, find a good groom for me. He must be taller than Balu. Stylish than him. Must smile better than Balu. l mean he must be pretty handsome than Balu. What's your idea anyway, you say Balu is stylish, his smile is good, and that he's handsome. Do you also have a boy friend? lf Balu has a girl friend, then l must've a boy friend, right? Right! Why should we wait for a fool's arrival, uncle? He's Mahalakshmi's boy friend. - l said about him only. ls his name Fool? l didn't know. Fool! ls his name Fool? l can't believe that someone loves Mahalakshmi, uncle. Are you comfortable, Ajit? What does he lack in a Benz car? No uncle, he's 6.1 feet tall, his head may hit the roof. 6.1? - Yes uncle. He's 2 inches taller than you, Balu. Doesn't your head hit the roof in your car? He got 3 cars custom built cars by Audi company. 3 cars? 2 more cars than Balu Where do you work, Ajit? Work? 100 crores? Twice more than Balu's business. You know l don't like all this. - See uncle, he hates praise. That's why, Ajit is always great to me. Won't you watch the signal? Are you blind? My car is safe. l didn't hit you, why are you getting so angry? How would you know? lf anything had happened, my heart would cease. My car is my life. Go...go away! Okay the project immediately. Our company must cross 100 crores with it. That's very risky! Acquire new systems, recruit new people, if anything goes wrong, we'll be in big trouble. lf we succeed? - l said it's risky. No life without risk. Though l know you're a fool, didn't l take you as my partner? lsn't that a risk? This one is also like that. Are both same? Then okay. Gave a good twist, sister. Ajit's entry was sensational. - Balu would've got jolted. You should've called us too, we would've teased Balu. We would've teased him. - Yes sister. How did the engagement go? Balu - Swapna Engagement Mahalakshmi - Ajit Engagement Long way... Long way without any shore... Though taking the same exam... though written the same answer... Each one of the two remain as question... Though met in the in same boat and travelling together... They reached different worlds... Shared same past and same truth... They hanged it by noose... Broke the world to create their own worlds in it... So near yet so far... Distance without any way till now... Today breaks in to separate the couples... Distance has been orphaned without a friend... Distance has been left burning in the fire of loneliness... lt's enjoying the breaking up of relationships... Distance is bitter in growing separation... Distance is glowing as dark night of pangs of separation takes over... Where's your son-in-law? Nephew! Not your nephew, your future son-in-law. Son-in-law! A distance where can't take a step... A distance where you can't cover an inch too... Distance ofjust seven steps has been stretched too far... Distance that changes word every milestone it crosses... Distance that changes the direction with every turn it takes.. Today has turned a sweet married life into a path of thorns... Distance is that which erases memories... Distance says can't move ahead unless starting point is forgotten... l wanted to see Balu and Mahalakshmi as a couple But my dream remains unfulfilled. Few dreams are like that, they never come true, mother. l wanted to see you and father together, has my dream come true? This one too! My son who never ever said a harsh word to me, today he got angry on me. So, l had to tell you everything. Ours is very big and wealthy family. l was well educated. l liked your grandfather's ideals and his social work. So l left home for your uneducated grandpa to be with him in his village. After few years, children grew up. My education didn't help me. l wished my children to study well and reach good position in life. l pestered him to shift to city. He said he couldn't leave the village. l left my home and my family for you, can't you leave this village for me and my children, l really got angry, l left him and came to city with children. We both waited for each other to come, we are still waiting. This is first wedding invitation. Both of you go together and invite your grandfather. Tell him, l've invited him. Tell him, l'm not in a position to move. Keep the luggage in my car. Keep it in my car. Please laugh! - Why sir? She cracked ajoke now! lsn't it joke to travel 500 kms in auto? Tell him not to pass comments on my car. l'm very happy to see you both. You both are fighting just like real man and wife. What' your problem now? ln which car to travel? There's a technique for it in America. lt is known as John Acharya technique. Put your car keys in my pocket. l'll mix it now. Kittaiah, come here. Take out a key. Keep the luggage in the car. - Okay sir. Keep the luggage in the car! Why are you keeping luggage in my car? Your car got picked up in the lucky dip, sir. Tell her to drive l'll not drive. - Tell him to drive l'll not drive. lf you keep fighting like this, you may meet with an accident. Why are you both fighting? Since you both know each other, right? Suppose if you both are strangers, and this is your first meeting, and you're not Balu but Shahrukh, why are you giggling? Didn't like my idea? l can't believe if you say Shahrukh. You're not Mahalakshmi but Kajol! lt's difficult to get convinced that she's Kajol. lf it's difficult, forget it. You drive for 3 hours, and she'll drive for 3 hours. But be careful with my car. Do you know heart that this bond is since time immemorial? How is my car? - Car is fine. lf you're bored switch on the radio. - Radio? We're listening to radio only, sound system is awesome. But l can't hear anything. - You're far away, right? Be careful, if anything happens to the car, my heart will stop. Are you mad? l'll complain to police. Police complaint? Then you must definitely know about us. Can't believe it? Such small incidents do happen in big countries! Balu? Who is Balu? l'm Shahrukh! Tell me uncle. So, you've entered the character. - Yes, uncle. Good couple! How is the journey? - Good uncle. But legs are paining. Legs paining? How can legs pain if you travel in car? lf you want me to tell, you must do one thing urgently, catch a cab and go to Care hospital immediately. Kajol is fine, right? l'm fine, you go to the hospital immediately. l've reached. l've come into Care from car. Tell me, where should l go now? l'll tell you, go to the emergency ward immediately. Emergency ward? Where is it? Go fast, uncle. - l'm running. l'm now in emergency ward. Do you see any vacant bed? - Vacant bed? Where is it? l found one. - Sit on it. Should l sit on it? l'm sitting on it. Call the doctor immediately. Why three doctors? - You called 3 doctors. Doctors are here. l must tell you 2 points now, uncle. - Go ahead. Point one is for you and point two is for the doctors. No need, tell me both, l'll inform the doctors. After hearing one, you can't hear the second one. Then, tell me second point first, how's my point? Okay, switch on the speaker. Tell me. Tell me! Uncle will get heart attack, treat him well. He's fine. - He'll say like that only. Tell me the point one now. Uncle, your car is smashed! Can you please do me a small favour, Shahrukh? Can you act like Balu before my grandpa? You too must do a small favour to me, Kajol. What? l must act like Mahalakshmi before your grandpa, right? l built the school here, l built the hospital, l built the water tank, l did all this and yet you say some Ambani is great! You're great sir! - Are you agreeing forcibly? No need to fight now. - Are you accepting to avoid fight? Not you Shahrukh, but Balu! l'll not donate anything for this festival, go to hell. Don't say like that sir, we trusted you, invited dance troupe, and they're here too, if you don't agree, we'll lose face. Sir! - What? Your grandson and grand daughter are here.- What? Son's son and daughter's daughter are here. Grandpa! - Grandpa! Please open the door, grandpa. Please talk to us, grandpa. l don't have anyone, please go away. Grandpa, my name is Balu Mahendra, named after you. Grandpa, my name is Mahalakshmi, grandma's name. Keep quiet. Has your grandma sent to check if l'm still alive or dead? Venkanna, ask them to leave. Won't you talk to us even if we say we're getting married, grandpa? Yes grandpa, grandma sent us to give the first invitation to you. Are you both getting married? - Yes grandpa. Are my grandson and grand daughter marrying? Do you know this? My grandson and grand daughter are marrying. Read the invitation. Mrs. and Mr. Ravikondala Balu Mahendra invite you to... How come your father is inviting with my name? Not father, it was grandma. Read further. On Friday the 18-3-2011 night at 9.30 pm, our son Ramesh's only son Balu Mahendra, will marry Miss... Miss... Will marry Miss Mahalakshmi. Did you hear it properly, grandpa? No, did you hear it? - No!- Read aloud! Will marry Mahalakshmi! No need of the book! Balu, give them donation. Give...take it. Celebrate the festival! Hail sir! Muddula Muvva Rao's pampered daughter matured at 18... Chittemma's second daughter-in-law became pregnant at 40... Raja Rao's third daughter eloped with fourth son of Pulla Rao... Then there are Mangatayaru, Gajula Chittemma, and Dubai Sathyavathi... They left their husbands... l can't tell their stories, they'll narrate it themselves... Dubai Sathyavathi, start it... He wanted livelihood and sent me to Dubai... He told me to send money to buy fridge and TV... He told me to send bucks to buy sofa... He told me to send cash to buy double cot... To keep all this he wanted a house... He told me to send more to buy in East West... Thinking we're well settled, got down from flight with great hope... ln the East facing home, on the double cot bed... l got upset after seeing his second set up... Girl, will you lend your beau? l'll upset him and come... Will you lend me your beau? l'll dip him in Dubai oil well... Oh no, l'll not lend my beau or allow him to jump in oil well... l'll not lend my beau or let you dare touch him... Dubai Sathyavathi rocked you, here comes Gajula Chittemma to blast you... lf he hears my anklets' sound, he'll ask where did l go? lf he hears my bangle sound, he'll ask who are you making gestures? lf man next door chokes, he'll say l'm thinking of him... lf man next door falls sick, he'll say he's worried about me... lf l say a mosquito bit me, he'll ask if it's male or female... lf l say an ant bit me, he'll ask if it's young one or old one... He'll link every man with me, adding colourful tales to it... He has put my chastity in shackles and l'm still a virgin... Poor woman! Will you lend me your beau, girl? l'll take him to the bush and come.... Will you lend him to me? l'll give every penny my hubby has... l'll not lend my beau and not let you get so lucky... l'll not lend my beau, l'll not let his madness rub on you... l know their tales but this girl is new. She's coming at me. He said my waist would make even lleanajealousy... He said l'm so hot to make even Mumaith Khan go mad... He said l could make Shreya run for her money in beauty... He said l'm more worth than Anushka... He saw my front and back and went crazy... He was my up and down and he fell flat... After seeing my face... Seeing your face? His fuse went off on seeing my face... He went down in a thud... He said l'm not fit for her... ls it such a good face? Why not show us also? Will you lend me your beau? l'll chew him with my eyes... Will you lend me your beau? l'll devour him with my words... l'll give my beau to you, l'm giving you my junior Shahrukh... l'm giving you my beau, l say there's no beauty than you... Don't give your beau... don't give up his hand... Don't give your beau... don't make your life barren... Where's my toothpaste? You know l don't like this toothpaste. Where did you keep my toothpaste? l told you nobody must use my toothpaste. Go! She's still proud! lt's false teeth! Celebrating birthdays too! Which button should l press to see her again? Why should l come? To see her in this condition. l can't bear to see her in this condition. Look at my Mahalakshmi! How beautiful she is! l spent my life watching this, can't l live few more years? Enough, these memories are enough. Want to know which button to press to see again? ls Balu there? Phone for you. - Who is it? What? Everyone is waiting here. l told, right? How many more times do l've to tell you? l'll come back in a second, grandma. l don't care, no company nothing, cancel all meetings. l'll take care of Prakash. How are you? - l'm fine Ajit. Fine. ls your grandpa doing well? He's fine. That's why, a special gift for you. You're saying nice without even seeing it. Really nice, right? You always say it, right? Say now. - What? That which you always say, please. You always say Ajit is great, right? Do you really like it? What happened, uncle? Balu signed contract with a cell phone company, he formulated the software with great difficulty, his friend Prakash, his partner, he sold off the software to another company, cell phone company wants to file suit on us, if we don't explain in 15 days, they'll fine us with penalty. Can't pay the penalty even if we sell everything. Balu is struggling unable to find a way out. What are you all doing? We are regaining our application, sir. Who told you to do it? New program Manager... - New program Manager? Come, we were waiting for you. We've 15 days time, let get ready more advanced software than what Prakash stole from us. You guide us, let's all work together. Cell Phone Company must be shocked with our version. But we don't have much time. We've to work day and night. - Who told you to come here? l want to help you out. l don't want anyone's help. lt's Mahalakshmi here! You made me an offer ofjob if l ask at anytime, right? l want ajob now, can't you take me? l'll leave if you say you can't. Kajol? Where's the bond? Where's the anger? Where's the distance? Has it increased? Only when you get yourself into troubles... Will this heart start moving? Can one step wipe out the distance created by years? Can one drop of rain douse the raging fire of bad memories? Will the past deeds change your fate forever? Would the unfulfilled desires become blessings now? When did you come, Ajit? l'll freshen up. Do you know the time now? l don't like you going out just days before our marriage. l can understand this but my parents can't. Stop going to office from tomorrow. Better stay at home. When is our marriage? Tell me. So l belong to this family till 9.29 pm, ask me anything after 9.30 pm, l'll tell you, my family is in troubles, my family needs me, your parents may not be able to understand, if you understand me, explain it to them. Marriage binds husband and wife in a bond... But suitor and his future wife relationship is by birth... Difficulties make you realize the weight of a relationship... Only tears can make you fathom the depth of a relationship... Will the past left yesterday show the way? Will it take you to the shore? l promised to tell you something if l get first rank, remember it? lf this project is success, l'll tell you. Before the drinks, l want to tell you something. lf l drink and then say, it'll be like drunken blabber. Lost...l've lost! l had decided not to take Mahalakshmi's help in my life. lf l take, it means l'm lost. But this success belongs to Mahalakshmi. had she not helped us, we wouldn't be celebrating now? That's why l'm saying l've lost. First time, l'm happy for losing. l'm happy for losing to win. Wait! l promised to tell Mahalakshmi something if l get first rank. But l couldn't say that. ln these moments of happiness, l want to tell her amidst you all! You challenged to make him say that, sister. You won! No, l never wanted to win over Balu. Do you know why l came here? - To study! No, for Balu! l don't like to study. But still do you know why l cried on failing? Balu can't see anyone who doesn't study. That's why l worked hard to study. l became his competitor. l like Balu so much, any girl would like to express her first love to the man she loves, but l had to say l love you to someone else for Balu's sake. Fate! Do you remember when l came her l wanted to tell Balu something?- Yes. l wanted to tell him, it's not infatuation but love. But when he said it was disturbance before everyone, l couldn't bear it. l left. l wanted to live without Balu. l tried but failed. But when John uncle asked me, l thought of telling l love Balu without caring about anyone's reaction. But l came to know Balu's heart is not vacant anymore, and it is occupied by a girl 2 inches taller than me. Sorrow...anger about losing Balu, in a fit of rage, l said okay to Ajit. l'm angry on Balu as much as l love him. But when Balu was in trouble, l worked hard to keep him number one always, l thought l found a place in his heart, when he said he'll tell me something, l was expecting he would say l like you, but he said that is Mahalakshmi! Tell me now have l won? What happened then, sister? l left that place. Are you here? Why did you leave midway? Did you hear what l said? That's what you wanted to hear, right? Are you shocked? l'm sure you'd be shocked to hear it from me. You're happy, aren't you? l'm happy. l'm extremely happy. Our company will cross 80 crores turnover. Not just 80 crores, in 6 months it'll overtake Ajit's company. Overtake Ajit's company? You mean l haven't yet done it, right? Ajit's company is big and mine is very small. Ajit is always great to you, not me! l didn't mean it. l'm nothing to you, right? Not a bit! Do you know how you were coming from village? l saw your hoarding, it was great! How surprized your eyes were! Balu was so great and so tall! He was in sky for you. l always wanted to see that feeling in your eyes. l always Balu must be great to you. When you said you'll go home, you know why l stopped you, l didn't want to lose you. But what did you do? You came first and equalled me. l was afraid l would no more be great to you. That's why l cheated you to study. But my bad luck, Ajit got the first rank. l compromised with you fearing Ajit may become great. l spent sleepless nights and without food to study, to make you feel again that l'm great and see the same feeling in your eyes, l did come first, but what did you say? You said Ajit is great! lt was all over! For whatever l worked hard, everything went waste. l couldn't bear it, l got angry, l told you to leave my home, Ajit is great! Those words still hurt me. You may feel why am l so sensitive if you praise someone else. l look like a big egoist, right? l look like a mad man, right? Because the girl l love mustn't feel anyone else is greater than me. Yes Mahalakshmi! You're my life, l'm mad about you. l thought you're my aunt's daughter, where would you go away? l had waited 3 years for you. You came to hospital that day. l felt sad why grandma didn't get a heart attack earlier. When uncle asked about marriage, l knew you'd refuse. That's why l said l've a girl friend. Since l said that l had to bring in Swapna. Do you know who is Swapna? She's my PA! What's your height? Would you like to marry me? l thought you'd feel jealous on seeing Swapna. But Ajit came in much better position than me. l risked my company to upstage Ajit. l lost everything. You came and helped me out. We succeeded! But what did you say again? The same thing Ajit is great! l've lost again. l wanted to make you say l'm great and express my love to you. But l was losing every time. l'm not great! l'm just plain Balu! You're my success and failure. l'm not there without you. But l don't have you anymore. Like giving first rank in alms to me, don't give your love as charity to me. That's the story of my great love failure. What's this twist? The girl loves you from the beginning, right?- Yes! You felt like that, right? - Yes, we felt like that only. l love her, right? l would've gone overboard at times, little deviations in narration. lf she doesn't love you, why would she say l love you? When did she say? - After you told her. After l told her. Had l not told her? lf she's not in love with you, why did she come to help you? Company belongs to family, so... She helped uncle's company, right? That's all, isn't it? Tell me now, you believe Mahalakshmi not loves me, right? l left my ego and told you my story, yet no one believes me. She didn't love me, only l loved her. l only had loved her, she never loved me, please believe it for my sake. We believe it. But l don't believe it. Somebody doesn't believe it, who is it? Who are you? Why did you come to the bar? Grandpa! - Grandpa? Father! Please come. When did you come, father? What's going on here? - Sit down, l'll explain. Tell me what's going on here? Balu and Mahalakshmi's marriage, father. Not marriage but marriages! l didn't want to come here. l came to know they cheated me by reading the invitation wrongly. After coming here l came to know they didn't cheat me, infact they're cheating themselves. Do you know Balu and Mahalakshmi love each other? Love? They always fight, father. Did you love her or not? Balu loves her but Mahalakshmi doesn't love him. Don't you love Balu? l told him many times but he doesn't believe me. She says she loves you, what's your problem? She says that before everyone. l don't want somebody else's love in charity. Ajit is great marry him. Look grandpa, what is he saying? lf l say Tendulkar is great, does it mean l love him? Look grandpa, she's comparing Ajit with Tendulkar. lt means he's Tendulkar and l'm a street cricketer. Don't irritate me. l'm getting angry. lt's natural for you, since you don't love me, right? ls my love infatuation? - Look at her, grandpa. Do you know what my feelings were? l almost died when you touched me. l feel like hugging you now. Do you know how difficult it is for me to stay away from you? She's shamelessly accepting her love publicly, why don't you believe her? You fool! Wait grandpa. She's a magnet like grandma. My logic is when she loves me so much, why did she love Ajit? Ask her to tell me. - Did l love him? l'll tell you. When did l say okay to you? Just before arriving in lndia, right? He does not believe me. Though Ajit has been proposing for 3 years, l never cared. l said okay to Ajit after you brought home Swapna. Don't believe her, grandma, she's like grandma. l don't want to marry at all, l'm refusing even if you say okay. Okay then, bring Swapna, l'll marry her. When l see you both, l remember the mistake l and your grandma committed 30 years ago, we brought this situation due to ego problems. How are you? This is our plight! There's bond of marriage between us, so we're meeting after years. lf it wasn't there, we would never meet in life. At least give up your ego after seeing us. Okay, l'll give up my ego, grandpa. But one condition, let her say l'm greater than Ajit, l'll believe her love. No grandpa, l'll not say that. lf he believes me only if l say he's great, it undermines my years of love. You said Balu is great in village, right? That was my darling Kajol, grandpa. l said about my sweetheart Shahrukh, grandpa. Who are these Kajol and Shahrukh? The credit of crating those characters goes to me. l lost my car too in creating it. Come here. - What's it uncle? Why did you slap me now? Already in trouble with characters here, are you creating new ones? Did my characters create any problem? Not created problems but found solution! Though lost car, concept worked out. Do you love Kajol? l love her very much, grandpa. Kajol has no flashback, so no Ajit. Do you love Shahrukh? Shahrukh is really great, he fought and saved my life. Change the boards! Mahalakshmi weds Balu Shahrukh weds Kajol She looks like Mahalakshmi, grandpa. Who are you? lf you're Shahrukh, she's Kajol, tie the knot! Bless them! l'm not Kajol but Mahalakshmi! Grandpa!
