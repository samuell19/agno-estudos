There was a third member of our family. Your sister, Mera. You must search for her. Mera? There must be some way we can find Neri’s sister. Maybe we could put an ad in the paper under missing persons. - Yeah. “Wanted girl who fell to Earth in space pod.” Great. - Well, I don’t know. Holidays coming up. At least we can get to the mainland. Yeah, check out the locals. - Talk to people. - Somebody must have found that pod. And HELEN could help us do a records search. If we can get her to access them. You can if anyone can. So what are you waiting for? Come on, HELEN. Hey, buddy! How’s it going? Busy. You must get pretty hungry doing all that brain work. Thanks. Maybe you could do me a favour, too. Like what? You and that computer... I heard you can make it do just about anything you want. Her, Mick. Her name’s HELEN. Yeah. What if someone wanted to see their school report? - They’re coming out today anyway. - Yeah, I know. I just want to see it. Well... I can give it a try. Michael Byrne... Wow, you really messed up this term. Bad, huh? Real bad, look at that. Yeah, I’ll take your word for it. What if someone wanted to... fix a report like that? No way. No way. Too bad, ’cause... my mom’d get really mad. And you know what’d happen then? - No. - No? I’d get really mad. Sorry, Mick. Remind me never to do you a favour, Froggy. Mum, Neri’s sister has to be out there... - somewhere, doesn’t she? - I’m not sure, sweetie. I hope so. I am still just trying to convince myself this is all actually happening. The incredible is never easy to believe, Dianne. But we did see it with our own eyes. You guys ready? Yep, won’t be a minute. I shan’t be joining you today. I’m taking some sonar equipment on one of the shark cats to run some tests. - So, it’s just you and me then. - Yep. I can stand it if you can. Let’s go then. Sooner the better. Who knows, we might even find something on the way. I’m sorry? Ah. I’ve got a little deal going with one of the mining companies. If I find any good mineral deposits, I’m on a percentage commission. And... does Commander Byrne know this? No. I’m certainly not on ORCA for the pittance she pays me. And I’m certainly not here for the social life. This way I can get the extra cash I need for my own new boat. And when that happens, you won’t see me for dust. And you expect me to cooperate? Well, it’s not going to kill you, is it? It’s all in the line of your work. What sort of things do you expect to find? Oh, I don’t know. But I’m due for a bit of luck. - This going? - Yep. What’s that thing? Nothing. Why are you hiding it behind your back? Come on, Captain! If you want to earn that new boat by the end of the century. The guy’s got a uranium super-charger on his rocket. Only he doesn’t realize that the bad guy’s got a Plutonium super-charger. - Or was it the other way around? - Rocky? Yeah? I don’t want to know. What’s eating you? I’ve got to get out and about. What for? I’ve just got to get off ORCA sometimes. You know what I mean? But it’s getting hard since the Commander cancelled our boat access. Well, what about the old Zodiac? The one round the back of the pontoon. That old thing? That was decommissioned ages ago. I could fix it. - Yeah. - No, dead set. My dad taught me to strip all kinds of motors. And hey... we could get off ORCA as much as we wanted. - Hi, Rocky. - Hi. What’s up? Rocky, why don’t you go and have a look at that new boat now. - I’ll be up in a minute. - Alright. You’ve got to get rid of this thing. Everyone’s asking questions. Okay. It’s pretty beat up. But there’s not too much wrong with it. Gonna give me a hand? Sure, but first I want to take one of those wave runners out. A final fling. We don’t need them any more, do we? Nope. This’ll get us anywhere we want to go. This is yours. You’d better put it somewhere where no one can find it. Neri… about Mera. It was a long time ago. Anything could have happened to that pod. A storm... I know you will find her. We’ll do everything we can. - Any luck? - No. HELEN’s tried the Navy and the Coast Guard. Nothing. It doesn’t look good, Jason. Let’s just keep trying. What next then? The newspapers! Yeah. If she was found there would have been reports. Froggy? Not bad. Access newspaper records, HELEN, for previous subject reference. - Yes, Froggy. What are we going to do if this doesn’t work? Search me. Mum’s going to hate me. No, first she’s going to kill me. Then she’s going to hate me. Sometimes bad school reports aren’t as bad as you expect. Yeah, well, mine are always worse. I’m not worried. I studied. Oh, listen to the genius. You think you’ve got problems? Froggy saw his results on HELEN. - They’re so low, you’d need a sonar to find them. - Yeah? Can’t wait to see what Commander Byrne says about her sweet little boy then. She’ll probably feed him to the sharks. You know, it couldn’t happen to a nicer guy. Has anyone seen my brother? Rocky was with Jason. - Maybe they’re in the lab or something. - Thanks. Fingers crossed for this afternoon. Oh, I think I feel sick. Oh, sorry. I was looking for my brother. I don’t think that’s me. No, I didn’t mean to interrupt. Oh, no, no. Oh, please! Please! I need an extra hand. Could you hold this? Sure. There. You are most kind. Perhaps one day evolution will catch up, and provide an extra hand for more complex tasks. More arms. More legs. Where would it stop? Suction pads for our fingers? Like an octopus with a fashion problem. You have a twisted sense of humour. Thanks. You’re also an excellent assistant. Thanks. So, what are we working on? A portable side scan sonar unit. Very powerful. For our geological survey of the ocean floor. What do you have to do next? Hook it up to a boat and see if it works. Can I go with you? - I thought you wanted to find your brother. - No hurry. If I wouldn’t be getting in your way I... You’re hired. Perhaps you could expand your theory on octopus fashions while we go out there. Ah, Dr. Hellegren. I have something for you. Enhance and synthesize the image. This creature looks human. Not only that, from the bone structure, we can safely say... it’s female. It is the girl. The girl from the sea. Are you all right? Yes. But I’ll let you into a little secret. - I’m not very good on boats. - Really? I’m a land creature. The swiftest gazelle on the beach, has no legs at all on the ocean. Well, it doesn’t matter. - You’re so good at everything else. - Thank you. Now, we’ll just give this a test run... and see if it works. It’s all right, Joanne. It’s just a whale. Beautiful, isn’t he? Yes. He’s not coming up. Oh, they can stay down for a long time. We’ll let the towed array out now. - I’ll give you a hand. - Oh! Thank you. I’ll check the monitor. Aaah! Joanne! Joanne! Joanne! Joanne! Joanne? Hey, Joanne! I can’t see you. I can’t see you. Joanne. Joanne. Ah, Neri. Thank goodness. She’ll be all right. Thank you. What happened? You hit your head. You’ll be okay. I was in the water. You saved me. Oh, no. I, I... I... Well, you see... Yes! I don’t believe it! I’m having this framed. That good, huh? Give me a look. - Ohhh! - My report! Gee, sorry. Michael! I’ve just read your report. And I must say I got a shock. This is gonna be heaven. It is extremely bad. I’m sorry, mum. I tried. Yes. Well... I know you can do a lot better than this. But obviously, settling in here has been a lot harder on you than I thought. Yeah. Really hard. After all, making new friends takes a lot of time and energy. And that’s important, too. So we’ll just forget about it, shall we? And I’m sure you’ll make up for it next time. Don’t worry. Guys like Mick, sooner or later, get what they deserve. I wish it was sooner. Thanks. Yeah, thank you, Captain. - That bad, huh? - Worse. Phillips is an obstinate, pig-headed... I only had to say to him “go to port” for him to immediately go to starboard! Well, Rocky’s fixed up that old Zodiac. Means we can get away without any hassles. Jason, I don’t want to hear about it, all right? I don’t want to hear another word about boats for the rest of the day! Come on. Yes! Got it! Of course, I couldn’t tell her it was Neri who saved her. So, unfortunately, I’ve become Joanne’s hero. Totally under false pretences. Winston… have you run through these scans you did yesterday? No, not yet. Look at this. How the image suddenly enhances. Wait. That must have been the exact time that Neri arrived. She would have been directly... and look how it reduces back again. Are you saying that... Neri’s presence enhances the readings. How? I don’t know. Perhaps something in her physical make up magnifies the effect of our equipment. But there’s the proof. Winston... you see what this means? If we can get this kind of detail and depth, we could reduce the survey time by half. You mean... get Neri to help us? Yes! Why not? Why not indeed. Who’s going to ask her? A baby. A baby girl! HELEN matched the newspaper article. The right time. The right place. - What does it say? - Not much. Somebody found a baby floating in the ocean. - Is there a name? - Johnny Mack. A fisherman from Cape Tribulation. Hey, that’s just up the coast. School’s finished. We can go there tomorrow. - But can we find him? - We’ve got to find him. This is it! This is our lead to Mera. There is no doubt about it. She is the thing communicating with the whale. But... the distances involved... I know. It cannot be verbal. Perhaps some kind of mental telepathy. That would be extraordinary, Doctor. Everything about this girl is extraordinary, Mr. Forsyth. That is why, wherever she is, I want her. You kids going to say something or are you going to stand there all day? We were looking for Johnny Mack. What would you say to him if you found him? We heard he might know something about a baby girl. She was found floating out on the coast a long time ago. Why would you want to know about that? Even if it was true. It’s important. We promised a friend we’d find out. Well, that’s different then. Friends have a right to know. Now that you mention it, I did hear Johnny Mack tell a story once. He was out fishing. He used to go out fishing every day just before sun-up. But this day... everything was still. No fish were biting. Like there’d been some big ruckus. He just couldn’t figure it out. And then, out of nowhere, this... thing bumps into his boat. And you know what Johnny Mack found inside? A baby? As beautiful as a frangipani bud. All by herself. That was years ago. She was a white girl. The authorities came and took foster family. You never saw her again? Johnny Mack never saw her again. That’s all I can tell you. Thanks. We’d better get going. Like I said. Friends have a right to know. That little girl... She was a bit different. If she met Johnny Mack... she’d want to say thanks for all the help. If I see Johnny, I’ll be happy to pass on the message. Neri! She made it, Neri. She survived the landing. - Where is she? - The authorities took her. Well, at least we know she’s somewhere. And we can start looking for her properly. Yes. Now we will look for her. We’ll find her. And then we will bring my little sister home! subtitles: Lemoncurd synch: KKCOPY - CEM, Lemoncurd
