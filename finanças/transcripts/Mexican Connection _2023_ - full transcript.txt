- Hey Vinny, where the hell is anybody? I mean, nobody picked me up. I just got out. Forget about it! Are you still over there in my apartment? In St. Augustine, Florida. Well, I want you out, and I hope you don't fucking destroy the place. Whoever this idiot is, Nick, that was supposed to get me, you tell that motherfucker I wanna see him someday. Forget about it. I'll walk to Amarillo and I'll get a fucking bus all the way to Jacksonville. Bye. Asshole. Motherfuckers. - Thanks, babe. Keep the change. - Always, Baka. - Every time. - Hey, how you doing? - Hey. - How much? - 5.60. Thank you. - Thank you. - How you doing? - I talked to the police today. I hope you are not here to bring more trouble to my business, are you? - Hey, 20 years, I can't get hug? Come here. Look, I know you have my life. What, you can't gimme a hug? What the, I mean, you gimme not much of a choice if you're gonna do that, you know? What are you doing? I can't say hello to you? Back in New York, you'll be calling me every day. I mean, you gimme no choice. - Give me the fucking money! - What the hell's wrong with you? The fuck are you doing? Trying to rob the place? You crazy kid! What are you robbing for? What do you need money for? Drugs? - I need the money for drugs. I need medicine for my mom. I need the money. - Your mom? I don't believe you. - For drugs, for my mother. She needs medicine. - What is this? - It's her prescription. - Prescription. You were gonna be a nurse. What is this? - It's for a woman, a very, very sick woman. - Get up! You wanna go to jail? You wanna know what prison's like? It's hell, kid! Every day you die in there! You wanna go in there? They'd take you out in one day. Take this and go get your mother's medicine, and don't come within a mile of this place. I'll blow your fucking kneecaps out! Get outta here! Stupid, fucking kid. Isn't time to lock up? It's late. - Sit down. - You're crazy. I thought this was only like this in New York. - Why are you here? What you want from me? Why are you here? Why are you back? You wanted to start another new family again? Anthony, have you looked in the mirror lately? You are an old man. You shouldn't, you wanted to have a family. I bet you don't know the whole, guess what happened to Sophia, do you? - I know she's dead. - When you owed the Italian crime family and you couldn't pay back the debt you owed because you were where you were, the small masters made it impossible for you to pay back. I guess it's because the feud existed in between your groups. They wanted to hit you really bad. Back in New York, Sophia, she tried everything to get you out of that. She stayed completely loyal to you. They didn't know she was pregnant, or, they just decided to kill her anyway with the pregnancy. I'm not telling you that to bring you back bad memories. I just, I don't want you to die in cold blood like Sophie and your unborn baby. I couldn't get over that for a very long time. I really love you, man. I just don't want you to do anything stupid. - But I gotta tell you what happened for real in New York. When the Don died, after he took out Sophie, I had him die like the animal he is on the street. And then his young wife, Gloria, she became LaDonna. She's the most evil bitch you ever met. She's not human. The things she does, I won't even repeat, but I'm not here for revenge. If they don't with fuck with me. But if they come near you or me, I'll kill 'em all. - I don't wanna see you again. I don't want you to come here again. I want you to stay away. You understand? I care about you, so here, here's a key to my apartment. I'm gonna be leaving for a vacation for two months, just in case you need to hide. It's not because I give a shit, but I give a shit. Now get the hell outta here. Now. - Thanks, Kitty. - What the hell happened here? Are you kidding me? Won't be needing this in Florida. Look at this place! Vito, never, ever again do you come here again. What the hell? Stay in Brooklyn, you idiot. Jesus. Sophie. Sophie. I love you, Sophie. I do. I love you. - Hey, where the hell is Giuseppe? Giuseppe, I'm not here to suck a dick. I'm here to make some money. What the fuck is wrong with you? What are you laughing at? What you got for me? I didn't ask you for cash. I don't give a shit about that. I want what's in the little box. You see what's here in this little box? It worth more than all you goombas put together. Now you listen to me. I wanna hit on Tony. You think 'cause I'm a broad you don't have to respect me? You motherfuckers, if my husband was still alive, you'd all be dead. Now you listen to me. You take that reward from 25 to 50K. I want Anthony D'Angelo dead. I don't want him to know this hit came from my family, you bunch of mooks. I want him dead. I don't care if you've got hire a jig or a fucking Russian, get a wussie or a fucking Mick to shoot him. I don't care. Get a fucking leprechaun if you have to. Hey Sal, put this in the safe. Now get the fuck outta here. - Boss, I got the perfect jig. I'll call 'em right now. - I need some pussy after those fucking mooks. - You know, you used to love taking this carriage ride, honey. Used to love coming by the old cods. Used to love it here, honey. Remember? Used to love coming by the library and the castle. What the? Who the hell are you? Hey, this guy's going to knock you off this ride. You're gonna be in jail unless let you get off right now. What do you want? - I know you. - I'll call the cops. - No, it's okay, sir. Don't worry about it, sir. It's just a bum. I got it handled. I promise. It's okay. - What do you think, I'm some gangster? Ghetto fool? - You want a cigarette? - Not me. - I'll give you a whole box. What do you want? - You're a master planner and the best thief someone like me could only pray to meet. Me and you go back further then you could possibly imagine. Remember back, a child and his mother crossing the Mexican border, starving and hungry, and you gave that boy a job as a gardener. - Ocho? - The one and only! - We were like this. What happened to you? You's just a skinny kid. Look at you. You grew up. - That's right. Ocho rose, rose, rose, and now I run shit. - Well, that's all good. You want a hundred bucks? All right, I'll give it to you. I gotta go, all right? - I have the means for your financial good. You should get an Oscar for that job you did in Spain. You robbed that town blind. - I don't know what you're talking about. - Please come out. I know he's still in there. - Get your fucking hand off me. - Yes, yes, yes! You still have it! You still have it. - How does this happen to me? How does this happen? - Look, don't worry. If I was gonna shoot you, I would've already had. Opportunity. Call me. You need me. Sophie, why don't you help me? All these nuts around me. Go away. Who is it? Get lost! Knocking like a nut. Who is it? What do you want? I have no disrespect, ma'am, but I'm not a Jehovah's witness. I'm a Catholic, all right? - My name's Angela. Call me Angie. I'm here, your housekeeper. - Housekeeper? I didn't order no housekeeper. - Are you gonna invite me in, or are we gonna spend here all day here in this space? - I didn't order nobody. Are you a cop? Oh, Vito! That's it. Vito called you, right? Vito called you. He should. How much is your rate? What's your rate? - I can't believe a human being actually lives in this place. You look familiar. Are you a killer? Are you a bad guy? - You know, you're making fun of an Italian in his own home, and that's not very smart. And what is this, a mic? What are you, a cop? You gonna arrest me? No, you can't, 'cause I just got out. You got nothing on me. - I didn't ask you about your history. But since we're doing that, I used to be a doctor. I came from Mexico. My brother brought me here. I am a woman with class. Why am I even doing this with you? Do I have the job, yes or no? I don't have all day. - Oh with that attitude, I'm gonna give you a job? What are you? What's going on with you? What are you, nuts? - I keep things professional with my clients, and clearly you need someone to take care of you and this place. - Who contacted you? - In time you will know. I can start work tomorrow. - No, not tomorrow. I got business tomorrow. I'll see you on Monday if you're lucky. - Hey, Nico. Julia, look at this guy. Look at this guy! - Good to see you, Uncle Tony. - Good to see you too. - Hi, Uncle Tony! - Hey, there she is! Good to see you. Look at that face. I seen pictures. You sent all those pictures. Angela, how you doing? - Hello, Uncle Tony. - Hi. Good to see you. What's your dad doing? - He's, uh. - He's on the phone. Business, right? - It's so great to see you. We've seen you all in the newspapers. You're a legend! You are famous! I've seen you all over the newspapers for years. We haven't been to Long Island in such a long time. - You're in Puerto Rico now, right? - Yeah. - Living like kings over there. - I miss it, but you should come down visit sometimes, especially 'cause you just got out of the slammer and all. - Oh, Tina. Come, come. - Hey, Francesca. - Tony, it's so great to see you. - Hey, you looking lovely as usual. - Thank you. - Nico Jr, you hit the grand slam out of the park, huh? - Thank you, Uncle Tony. I saw your newspaper clipping in Long Island. I thought you were the best thief out there, man. - Yeah, okay. - Hey, hey. Okay, I'll call you back. Won't you sit down? Let's have a bottle. A bottle, a glass of wine. - Kids, you know, - They're grown. Look at 'em grown up. - How you doing? - Let me take them to the walk. Come on, kids. - All right, honey. - See ya, kids. - Thank you. - I'll go. - I'm just gonna talk to my brother for about 20 minutes. I'll see you later. I'll see you later. - Tony, always. - What are you doing? What are you doing here in Florida? - Hey, the kids, must be nice. Yeah, I wish I would've seen them all those years. They look great. I'm proud of you. Nothing like Uncle Augustino's, but it'll do. - Uncle Augustino's wine was great. This tends to cost a little bit more. Now tell me, honestly, what the hell are you doing here in Florida? - You know, I think you know what I'm doing here. - Are you here to see LaDonna? You still have this fucking vendetta that you've been carrying inside of you like a poison to avenge Sophie? Is that why you're here in Florida? Let me tell you something, if you come up against her, you're gonna lose. You're just like pop. You're always out for revenge. You have no fear. And I don't want to bury another one of my family members. You could go anywhere you want. California, Chicago, Vegas even. Everything's wide open. But if you come up against LaDonna, with all the manpower that she's built in the last 20 years, that's why I'm here, brother. I'm here to save you from yourself. I made a promise to pop to look after you. On his deathbed I swore to him that I would protect you, and guide you, and look after you. Come work with me. Come to Puerto Rico. You could be my partner. You could start a new family, meet a new woman, have some kids of your own. - Nico, I'm not leaving St. Augustine until I get justice for Sophie. You got that? - I know you're not afraid of dying, you thick headed, son of a bitch. Just like pop. What the fuck is wrong with you? Don't walk away that way. It's been a long time since I've seen you. You just have a death wish, don't you? - Okay, you take care of your kids. You take care of your family. You take care of me. I love you, kid. - You are my family, you stubborn son of a bitch! - Who are you? What are you doing here? Don't think I won't shoot. What's your name? Who are you? - It's me, Angie. You saw my brother. I resumed today because you didn't call me to resume last week. I tried to get a hold of you, but you weren't anywhere around. The screen door was open. You told me to come. Did you forget? - The screen door was open? Sit down. The hell's wrong with you? Can't believe I left the screen door open. I'm losing my mind with all this pressure. Can't believe this. You know, you could have been killed. - I know who you are. The legendary thief of the nineties. I know you're not a killer, but you can if the need arises. My brother and I met after your first meeting. He's not my favorite person, I must confess. We met and I needed to pick something from a friend. He accompanied me there. I saw some files in his hand. I went through the details and I saw who you actually are. You need me. He brought me to your apartment to become a cleaner for you. I am very resourceful, trust. - Maybe I'll trust you, but you know what? I didn't know you guys were related at all. This better not be a set up. - What? - Yeah, what? All right, it's time I met your brother again. It's time he became my friend. I need friends right now. - I can make that happen without any delay. He's with a client at the moment though. Once I'm done with the cleaning of the whole place? - All right, you did a good job. How long you lived here? - Six years tomorrow. But it's late and it's a long way home. - Well maybe, you know, since we gotta do this business with your brother and all that, maybe you stay here? I mean, it's up to you. - Hmm, I can do that. Is it okay if I stay in the guest room? There's no guest room, but you can stay in my bedroom right behind the French doors and I'll sleep on the couch, all right? - Can I trust? - Yeah, you want me to trust you? You gotta trust me. It's a two-way street, all right? - Maybe you can teach me to be a very smart and creative thief like you? I mean, I bet it'll be so much fun. - You know, you remind me so much of Sophia. She was a lot like you, funny like that. Except she had a thick Mexican accent. How come you don't have one? - My brother and I spend most of our time growing with the Americans that came to the country. I can hardly remember ever spending time with kids like us. I spent time with the American doctors and I loved medicine since then. I've always imagined that I'll probably go on an adventurous trip with a man I love. - Sounds beautiful. - I wish to run away again from the drug cartel my brother works with. - Yeah, well, it's kind of strange how he meets me on a horse and you're here now. - I really want a different life. Very beautiful. Very. I'm a mess right now. I, uh.. 20 years inside there does something to you, believe me. I, um.. a part of me died when Sophia died. I'm sorry. Sophia taught me a few words like, but I, I'm Italian. I don't speak Spanish, sorry. - I mean, all black? Why not add some color? - When Sophia died I promised myself I would wear black every day until I learned how to live again. - We've all have something we've lost, but we lose to gain something back. We have to keep living. You can call it a gutsy movement. I call it whatever it feels in my heart. It's never too late to open your heart. - Get outta here, kid. I'm too old for you. Good night. - You know, you really are a nice person. - Not all the time. - Good night. - Lights out. Hey! Hey, Jimmy! - Hey. - Yeah. Gimme two grand on the Tigers, plus two points. - What you talking about? The spread ain't that. - What the hell you talking about? - It's only one. - What do you mean, one point? In the papers it's plus two. What the hell you, get the fuck outta here. - Spread New York's one point. - No, I'm not doing it unless you gimme two points. Forget about it. - All right, all right, all right. You got two. - All right. That's more like it. All right. I got some guests coming in. Talk to you later. Hey, there they are. Look at that. Ocho, how you doing? Look at this. Coming to my house like old times. Hey Angie, you wouldn't believe this. When he was a kid, your brother, when he was young, he used to come by my place in New York, him and his mom. God bless your mother's soul. I used to leave a $5 bill underneath this pillow, right? And he knew I knew that he knew that I knew he was taking it every time. I don't forget things like that. That little five you slipped out every time. - You know, I brought you a gift because I know how you Guineas love your garlic. You bathe in that shit, huh? - Hey, what is this, from Naples or what? - No. - The half a dollar store from down the street? Thank you very much. Now you, you have to have some of my Uncle Augustino Iadellie's red, basement wine. - The basement, huh? - Yeah, we also make sausage. Gets you high, buddy. - Shit. Not bad. - Now look, let me ask you a question. Did you set me and Angie up? I'm just being frank. Just tell me the truth, and you know, I love her, so it's okay. I don't care. - Actually, kind of wondering why, why the fuck she's here. Huh? I'm surprised at that. - I'm not. - Hey, look. It's all okay, all right? - You wanna be in men's conversations? You know the drill. - Well, look, I mean it's okay. Put them on. You know why? Because it protects you. You don't know anything, you can't say anything. Nobody could ask you. Hey, look, when I was young, you know, my pops wouldn't even let a woman in a room when we were talking business. So it's just, it's normal. It's natural. I love you. - He does it every time he talks about cartel business. I'm used to it anyways. - First of all, did I come for a grand inquisition? Huh? What are you gonna ask next? What color my jonnies are? Huh? What is this? Did you bring me here to interrogate me? What you wanna know? My sign? I'm a Libra. - I want this to work out, but I gotta know what the you're talking about. Number one, I got a problem with LaDonna over there. You know, LaDonna from New York. The girl's an asshole already. She's getting worse the older she gets. And now she's down in St. Augustine. I'm gonna have to look for a job as a gardener with you pretty soon if I don't get something going here, you know what I mean? You're afraid of LaDonna? - I ain't afraid of nobody. I'm too stupid to be afraid of people. - There he is. There he is. I knew you were in there. That's why I followed you. That's why I came. That's why I came. I got a sweet deal for us. - All right, look, let's get off the bullshit. Just jump to the gig, will you? - We're talking about diamonds. Pretty, little diamonds. Not that crypto shit. That stuff you can't see. Old school, baby. Old school. You ready for this? 'Cause I'm talking 400,000. How would you wops say it? Calzones. I am your Mexican connection. Hey? - You woke me up. All that's good, you know, and I think LaDonna, she's got connection in South Africa with blue-white diamonds, the most expensive diamonds in the world. But that woman is a snake. Are you sure about the intel? - Oh, I could smell that money already. I know you wops love your money, just like us Mexicans. Oh, we loves putitas, pinatas, and mama's cooking. - Yeah, but you know, Ocho, you know, I'm very proud of you, you know? You become a big landscaper and all that, but this is like a real high end heist. You know what I mean? And this ain't no fucking liquor store, you know what I mean? - You don't have that drive anymore. Maybe you're just too old. Maybe the younger lion, it's ready. It's time for him to strike. People fear me all over the world. All over the world. - Ocho, fear doesn't give us any money, any money. - You're right. You're right, you got a point. - You know what? I say, we drink and celebrate to the fact that I accept. - Uh! - Hey, just one thing. I want you to know that I promise you that I will not exploit your youth and inexperience. - What? You never seen a man in boxer shorts before? - Who do you think you are? I've been trying to get things done, like always, and you have been acting cold to me. God. I've been simply falling for you and you've been acting like a jerk. Why don't you just grow up? You've been walking around that house in boxers with a bowl of cereal. - Hey, I'll eat cereal in my house any time I want. I'll wear boxers. You don't need to tell me what to do. The hell's wrong with you? - Dear me, he definitely needs to clean up. Huh, Yankee drinks coffee. Let's see some tea around here somewhere. Earl gray, man. - I'm gonna dislocate your fucking shoulder. Who the fuck are you? Are you ready? - Ah! Please refrain from breaking my arm. - Fuck you. It's already dislocated. Who are you? - My name is Lawrence Windsor. I do apologize, but Ocho sent me. - Ocho sent you to my house? I never told him to send you to my house. - Yeah, but I'm actually part your team. - Get up. I coulda shot you, you stupid bastard. - I know. Excuse me a moment. - Well, I know how to dislocate 'em, but I don't know that trick. How'd you put it back? Where'd you learn that from? - I was a doctor for 20 years in the Special Air Service. So I know how to do things with one's anatomy. - All right, what's the plan? What's next? - Well, I was told to bring you to the location. So, do you mind if we go now? - This should be it. There he is. - Speak of devil. - Gentlemen, apologies for my tardiness. Please be upstanding. In fact, may I introduce you to the one, the only, Mr. Anthony Angelo. - D'Angelo. This place safe? - Of course it's safe. Would I bring you to a place where the cops would get you? Come on, man. It's his place. It's good. - Lock it up. Pull the divider in front of the door. Nobody can see in. Pull it the way across, all the way across. - So what's you think? - Hold on. - Of our little rag tag, motley crew of criminals, huh? Let me introduce you first. You met Ace, master in weapons. Killing comes nothing to him. - Hey Ace, you know the Feds, they got these big elephant ears. They're gonna hear everything we say in here. You know what I mean? - No worries. - Muscle. Must I say more? And the secret weapon, the best part of the crew, is the secret weapon: the kid. - What, we babysitting minors now? - Minor? This kid has an IQ of 160. He's smarter than all of us combined. To him, we're mindless apes. A bunch of gorillas. This guy can crack any virus, security system, anything you put in front of him. And this salty, ugly South African, this guy right here can crack any safe. I know you used to be the best 20 years ago, but everything's digital now. This guy, right? - Hey, what's wrong with him? Why is his hand shaking? The guy's hand shaking. - Yeah, he needs his meds. Where is it? Give it. - The fuck is going on? - He's having an event. - Take your damn pills. - The fuck is wrong with this guy? He's fucking shaking. - It's probably an epileptic fit, you know? - Epileptic? - Yeah, he has epilepsy. He's a little schizophrenic, but trust me, this guy right here. - The fuck? - He's crazy like a fox. Trust me, okay? All right. Snap out of it. What the hell's wrong with you? - Aren't you the motherfucker that got his wife killed by the mob? - Ah. - Fuck! - Dude, dude. Money, money. Sit the fuck down right now. - What the bleeding hell is wrong with you, Yankees? I mean the job hasn't even commenced yet and you are at each other's throats. I mean, it's all gone to pot, hasn't it? To think Ocho, I gave up the Swedish job for this! - Shut the fuck up. - No, why don't you shut the fuck up? - For once, for once I agree with the Brit. We all need to shut the fuck up. - Hey look, what's the plan? - Don't worry about it. I got it all handled. - This guy looks like a milk man. - I know, I know what you up to, man. I know what you up to. - Kid, kid! - I'm in the middle of a match. - Let me tell you something. I want the whole layout. LaDonna's house, the hotel, and the place we're hitting it, and I want it today. You got it? I just did that two days ago. That was fucking easy. What'd I tell you about this kid, huh? Genius. - Hey look, I just want to get this job done. We're not going in to do anything but take one item. A two carat, blue-white. No gold, no silver. You see the a hundred dollars bills stacked up, you leave them alone. They're all traceable. This fucking bitch is smart. You got it? You just take the blue-white. That's it. - Is it cut or is it uncut? - It's beautifully cut. Now, that's what we're looking for. I need you to help me find out how many security he's got. We're not gonna kill anybody. - What? - What we're gonna do is you're gonna get some of those darts. Just regular darts. We're gonna tranquilizer hers, okay? And we hit 'em with that. I know it sounds bad to you guys, but I'm not going to jail for life. I just got out. No killing. We're there for the heist. The job's over, the worst case scenario, we get hit for a little bit of time. You get what I'm saying? All right. Look, I know you can take it like anybody here. All right? But if you listen to me, I'll fill all your bank accounts up. All of 'em. You fuck with me, I'll kill you. - That guy's nuts! - Look, LaDonna killed his wife and his unborn child. He's the man for the job. He's a genius. A bloody genius. - Yeah, he not working with him. - So I'm curious, Ocho, I mean, are you considering having children in your future? Because the state of this car, it's not really appropriate for the job, is it? - You chose the car. - No, no, no, no. I didn't. - I chose it, okay? I chose it for a reason. You're gonna do a job. You're not gonna go around trying to show off so the Feds can see you, everybody else, the cops, what is wrong with you? - I'm just hoping people don't see me. - Well, I have to say, I mean, compared to your country, I mean, let's face it, I mean, we left you in 1776. That's what? 300 years. Whereas our current queen has been on the throne for 70 years. Just shows you that we have style, and elegance, and poise, and what do you Americans have? - How old's your queen? - Oh, she's 95 now. Shall I turn left here? - So she's basically the crypt keeper. She should be dead. - Well, I mean, you know, I, she, you know what? I'm absolutely flabbergasted that you would say something like that here. - Hey, look. - Look on the road! - Hey look, we gotta go to work, all right? I'm done with this bullshit, all right? Now look, just go, just go. - You know, I mean, we are supposed to be working together, and why say something? - She's an old bat! Who gives a fuck? - Excuse me, better than Joe Biden, yes? Okay. Now he's what? 85? - Can we go to work? You guys talk too much. - Talk too much? You put me in the front with this? - Is this the exact, exact one? - It's very similar. It's a replica. - What do you mean it's similar? - It's a replica. - What do you mean, a replica? It's the same one. It's not case hardened, the one we're getting, right? - No, not case hardened. - You're a hundred percent? - A hundred percent. - Why am I not involved in this? You know, after working with the Duchess of Marlborough on that job in, oh 2016, and I just can't understand why I'm not being involved. I mean, that is just elementary. - Gas. - Check. - Stethoscope. - Check. - Drill. - Check. - Goggles. - Check. - I know what it is. It's because I'm a Brit. - What the fuck are you whimpering about over there? Can't you see we're working? - I know that. - Crowbar. - Crowbar? This is 2022. This savagery's gotta stop. This primitive kind of thinking, man, for heaven's sake. - I don't have time for this. - Were you born in a jungle? Are you living in a tree? - I'm used to, you know, a Rolls-Royce Phantom. - What the hell are you talking about? - The digital age. - What? - As I said to you, I wanted a Lamborghini Diablo, a Ferrari Testarossa. Even the Porsche 9-11 Turbo does naught to 164.2 seconds. What do you give me? That funny wagon, clubbed out vehicle. It was absolutely disgraceful! - Brit! I told you we can't have any bling when we do a job. - And what does that mean? - This guy talks too much! Will you just shut the fuck up? - That's right. Plug your cake hole. - Oh, please. I'm a Yankee doodle dandy. A Yankee doodle day! A Yankee doodle dandy! A Yankee doodle day. Stuart! There's an incoming! On the right! Watch out! Watch out!

You shouldn't be talking like that around there. There he goes right there. What the hell? Hello? - They don't know me, but I know you. Let's just say I'm a friend. Those two on the right, they want you back. - Follow him until he come back to his car. - I don't see him anywhere, man. - LaDonna, we lost him. - He's stupid, so I'll find him. - Come on, let's go.

Thanks. - It's a woman's place. I can smell the perfume. - It's a friend. - Hmm. - Hey, you sleeping? Angie, you asleep? You know Angie, sometimes people tell me, "Hey Tony, you're a good man." I don't believe 'em. You want to know why? 'Cause every time someone gets close to me, they get hurt or in trouble. It's like what happened to you today. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Sophie's told me. She said, "Tony, you better find somebody who loves you," right before she died. You better find someone who loves you. I never thought I would my whole life. Angie. Angie, baby. I got enemies all around me. Angie, you know your brother? I don't think he's what you think he is. I can't put my finger on it, but there's something with that guy. But I'm not gonna allow anything to hurt you. Never again. - I can't believe I just made love to Elvis. - I would've thought you like Frank Sinatra better. Hey, come here, kid. How come today you risked your life? How come you did that? Risking your life and not talking? - I knew that if I talked you'd probably be dead. And somehow I knew you'd walk through that door. - You have more faith than I do. Would you do it again? - As long as my heartbeats. Hey, Tony? - Yes? - I gotta tell you something. - Not now, let's just rest up. We talk seriously. - I have to tell you something. - Just do it later, baby. I'm so tired. It's all good. I got you. I got you. - Okay. - I got you. - Food Dash, tacos. - I think the boys ordered tacos. - Muscle, get your fucking ass up here. - It's clear. - Ocho, where'd the kids say the safe was? - It's right in front of you. The honey pot's right there. Let's get it, boys. - Bingo! - Didn't I tell you, brother? Didn't I tell you? - Fire! Goggles. - Come on, come on. We don't have time. Come on, come on! - Action! Spark! - For five more K I could have got that lock safe open. - Incidentally, how I wonder are we were able to track them on camera? - I changed the camera a week ago. The security system sucks. - Man of my experience and superior intellect in a car with a 20 year old playing on a computer. - I did a background check on you three days ago. I hacked into the MI6 records. The only bond you've got is a bail bond. - What's taking so long? Open it! Open it, open it, open it! Keep it going. Keep it going. - Don't make it too hot. Don't heat it up too much. Don't heat it up too much! - Come on, come on! - Don't make it too hard. Gotta be careful. - Get it work! - Don't do too much. 'Til the color changes. - Drill! - Be careful, be careful. Oh my god. - It's fucking case hardened! It's case hardened! - Let me try this. - It's case hardened! You gave me the intel!

Tell me to drop. - The heck, you think I came in with the last rank drop? I know what the fuck to do! - Hey, listen. In my attention, man, we respected people who are in the business, okay? Shit - I need a code. I need a code! Dammit! - I got the code. - Give me the code! He's got the code! - Give me your phone!

You gave it too much heat. - I didn't burn anything up! That was perfect heat! Give me the crowbar! The kid was right. I heard it drop. The lock dropped. I just need to pry it open. The code was right. Give me the crowbar! - All right, man! What do you wanna do, this primitive? - Get off! The crowbar! - You're barbaric! I can open it with my mind! - Get off!

He's good. - Can I keep it? - Quiet. Don't wake up the damn roosters. Hey, what are you doing? I told you not to fucking take the cash! What is wrong with you? They'll trace us. - Mario, go wait by the car. Go! - Should I go this way, or that way? - Get the fuck out of here. This guy's fucking crazy. - All right, put your fucking hands up, man. - You wanna put that gun down unless you want do 300 years. - What are you talking about? - Shooting a government official. - You're a cop? - Actually, old man, maybe your eyes are getting bad. You know the difference between CIA agent and a cop? Give me that gun. - What about the tattoos? - The CIA has the best makeup artists. Actually, I think it kind of suits me, doesn't it? Where's the diamond? - I swallowed it. I felt the setup, but I didn't know you were cops! - You fucking swallowed it? You fucking swallowed it? - Get the fuck inside, man. - But now you're gonna go to a room where you're gonna extract that diamond your damn self. Better have it by the morning. - Well, hello, Mr. D'Angelo. Have a seat. I trust you slept well? I trust even more, more importantly, I trust you extracted the diamond. - Yeah, I shit the diamond. He's got it in the plastic bag. - Very good. Well, let's cut to the chase. You are a great safecracker. We could use someone like you here in the agency. - You already did use me. Where's the big mouth Brit and the kid? - The Brit and the kid have been reassigned already up north, but that's no concern of yours. The main thing, the reason why we brought you here, is right here in this folder. Everything you need to know. As a matter of fact, we have a common enemy, a common threat, LaDonna. She's not a small potatoes criminal anymore. She's risen to be someone of great concern. She now does dealings with both the Chinese and the Russians selling important intel that could topple the whole east coast and cause danger to the great United States of America. We need to take her out. - Angie, huh? - Officer Sanchez. Nice to meet you, Mr. D'Angelo. - I can't shoot. What an actress. - First thing that is taught to us when coming aboard the agency is how to be a good actor. And Ms. Sanchez, you served your country well. - Yeah, you took one for the team, didn't you? You're a team player. - Wait, Jimmy. It's okay. Mr. D'Angelo has been in a lot of stress lately. A lot of stuff has happened within the last 24 hours. - Let's get this straight. I spent 20 years in jail. I get out. You guys set me up for a robbery. You use your agents and that whack job over there, and then you arrest me. What the hell's this about? - If he insults me one more time, I'll punch his little teeth in. - Officer Stern, that's not the way we operate. We need to treat this individual under the rights under section AN7. - You know about the Russians of the Chinese. She's been smuggling kids, giving intel, gaining intel, then selling it back to them. LaDonna is slated to meet with a high powered official in China. She was gonna use that little diamond as a bargaining chip to gain their trust. - What about the darts? They're waking up by now. They'll tell her I was there. I did everything. - Those guards that you thought were knocked out. They're dead. We have a guy on the inside. One of her guards, right? There will be a gun. Right side, third seat from LaDonna. We're here to make, what would you gangsters call it? An offer you can't. - Fuck you very much. No, thank you. - Fuck you very much. Well, it's very humid here in Florida. Wouldn't you say so, Officer Sanchez? Really hot and humid. I would say it's probably the worst place to have to serve 30 years. - Yeah? Of course I'm here. What the fuck you think? What time you getting here? Hurry the hell up. Sir? - You guys need me, gimme a call. - Is he clean? - He's clean. - Sit down. - LaDonna. Respect. Ah, taste the wine. Uncle Augustino Iadellie's eh? I needed that. Grazie. - Tony, as kids, you always had a way of talking your way out of things. I remember when my husband had control of the lower east side, you got in trouble with the cops and talked your way out of it. Everyone admired your silky voice. - Salut. Grazie. - All right, Tony, you know I'm not here to suck any dick. Let's get down to the skinny of it. Listen here, Tony. I knew your father and I knew your brother. What happened to Sophie was just fucking business. Nothing personal. My husband was taken down like a pig in Times Square, but that's the past. Tony, Tony. I got big since you got in. I got bigger than the Don ever dreamed of. I got ambassadors eating out of this pussy. Worldwide shit, Tony. Tony, I got the world by a All these dirty, old men, all they need is a third world bitch and some panties. Got 'em bouncing like puppets. And you know we got all those old men on video with all those young bitches. Tony, that's billions, not millions. We could rule the world. Come with me, forget the past. You're gonna be family. I'll pay you like never before. No more hate. No more games. Just counting money. - LaDonna, I don't know, fellows, I don't know how she's done this. I mean, you know she's always been smarter than the Don, right? I mean Mac, you know what I'm saying? Hey, I knew your father, by the way. He was a Wesite, right? Yeah, he used to work for my father. A good man. Rest his soul. - Tony, my safe was robbed last night. Couple of my boys got it. Tony, was it you? Give me one good reason I should believe this sit down isn't just bullshit. Michael will kill you right here right now, and you know it. You've got one minute to convince me, motherfucker. - LaDonna, what happened last night, I didn't cause it. I hired outside guys. They lied to me. They said the darts are tranquilizers. They lied and they killed them. It was not me. The only thing I was doing there is trying to get this diamond so I could give it back to you to show you respect, to show your peace offering. That's all I was doing. I just wanted to give you this as a peace offering. - You slick son of a bitch. You got my diamond and gave it back to pay your loyalty? I knew it was you, Tony. - So you took out my cousin? - What the fuck are you talking about? The fucking guy raped your sister. You were gonna fucking kill him anyway. Stop the bullshit! The chinks are gonna give me the White House. You know, the chinks own the White House. - LaDonna, you know I've been inside. I've been in hell for 20 years. And what I learned inside there was that things, they stopped making sense. You understand what I'm saying? And I knew when I was in there, I realized that when Sophie died, part of me died, and I knew when the Don died part of you died. Am I right? Now look what happened. We both lost, but now we have a chance, and there's only one thing we can do. 'Cause you see we're either gonna die in the street like pigs, or we're gonna make a lot of money together. Like billions, like you said. You know, you're like me, you don't give up, and I don't give up. So we have to make a choice. I mean, we're the same animal. You know what I mean? I mean, you're an animal, LaDonna. - Stop. Anthony's actually making sense right now. Go on. - You're one of the smartest people I know, all right? You didn't come back to New York 'till you was 20 years old, but they knew you was the brains that was gonna operate this thing. LaDonna, when I was on the inside, like I said, you know, things stopped making sense. I knew that we only had one choice, and that choice is to choose survival. We have to survive. I wanna live like you do. I wanna live like a king, and I know you wanna live like a queen. So we unite, we stop this war. We come together. We make a lot of money. We survive. - Sounds good, Tony. It all sounds good. I'll forget the Don. You forget Sophia. - No! - No? What do you mean, "No?" - What I was trying to say to you was on the inside I learned that things stopped making sense. For example, you know these young girls that you exposed to these old men, you made a lot of money, right? And you made yourself very powerful, did you not? I, LaDonna, I just lied to you. - She's dead. - Give me a gun! - She's dead. - Give me a gun! This is for Sophie and the young girls. - She's dead, Tony.
