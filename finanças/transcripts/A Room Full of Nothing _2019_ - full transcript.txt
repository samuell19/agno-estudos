It's like, barely even there. Yeah, not a good night for moon tanning. What? Moon tan. - Is that a thing? - Yeah. It's like a suntan, but with the moon. But, I mean, that's just sunlight reflecting off the moon, so it's still just like, just the sun. Then why do they call it moonlight? I'll be damned. I don't wanna stay out here much longer. I don't wanna get a moon burn. Oh shit. Mm, you make the best stew. - You like it? - Mmhmm. Okay, wow. Why wow? I'm just surprised, that's all. Surprised by what? I uh, I didn't know that you liked turtle. - That's not even funny. - I'm not being funny. - Barry, stop. - I can't stop. There is a turtle, in your bowl. - Take it back. - I can't take it back. - Take it back. - I can't take it back. - Take it back. - I can't. Joke's on you. I love the taste of turtle. Mm, mm, mm! Hey, Steve. Oh, hey Bar. - Thanks. - Thanks. Lovely weather we're having, today. What? The weather, it's nice. Oh, uh, sure. Gonna be hot. What? It's gonna be hot. - It's uh, hot every day. - Yeah. Humid heat. Uh huh. Well, I'm gonna go inside, cause of the heat. Right, see you around, huh? Sure. Motherfu Barry Klein does little more than spit out a line, as if he's reading a textbook. His character portrayal is mind-numbingly dull. But where Barry Klein is lacking in his performance, it's made up for by the true stars of the Austin Theater community, especially in Kimberly Lee's heartwrenching portrayal of the grieving mother. Where does this guy get off? It's just one man's opinion. But he's wrong. Heartwrenching? Babe, I'm proud of you, okay? Go out there tonight, do your thing, and don't give a shit about what anybody says, especially, Steven Dordoff? Is that even a real name? Yeah, it's a real name. A real shitty one. A real shitty review. Anyway, I need you to help me take some pieces into the gallery today. - Do I have to? - Yes, you do. Why? 'Cause if you don't, I'll have to kill you. - Ooh. - And then, I'll have to commit suicide. - Murder suicide. - Oh, damn. - Do you want that? - No. Do you really want me to be dead? No. Is Jamie gonna be there? Probably. Oh, but I don't like her. Well, you don't like anybody. Well I especially don't like her. Me neither. - Whoa. - Whoa, watch it! Jesus. Fuckin' Californians. Hey Susie. Hi Phyl, sorry I didn't see you there. Is Jamie here? Yup, she's in the back. Fuckin' hell, here. Take these. - No, just... - I'm stayin' here. With her? Yeah, with me? Make it quick. Oh my God. It's gorgeous. The last stuff you brought in was garbage, but this is really nice. Thanks. I've been inspired recently. It shows. Whatcha readin'? A story. No shit, a story? Uh huh. What's it about? Okay, so this couple's been together since high school, and she got an incurable blood disease, and she died. You know, sell a few of these and you'll be a real artist. I am a real artist. What? Before that, her husband, or boyfriend, or whatever, he's like a photographer, and so he went to the hospital, and took pictures of her, in the last days of her life. You know, with like, the black and white, and the light, and shit? I have a house full of art that I made with my own two hands. This is an actual piece of art that I made, I am a real artist. Why are you trying to fight me? I'm not. I mean, that is so fucking romantic. I wish that my boyfriend put half that effort into anything. I don't have time for this. I have a huge fucking gallery opening tomorrow, which maybe you know something about, because your art is hanging in it. I have a shit ton of work to do to get ready for it. All right, can I help you? Yeah, that would actually be really great. Some girls just have all the luck. But she's dead. Your point? Barry, what are you doing here? Jamie, nice to see you. All right, don't be mad. What? I think I'm gonna stay here and help with the opening. You sure? She seems particularly vicious today. Yes, and yes. Okay, well, I would offer to stay and help, but I hate her, and I don't wanna do that. All right, break a leg. I'll try. Hey. Oh, hey Barry. Did you see the review? Yep. - I'm gonna go get dressed. - You're so talented. Hey man. Hey, Barry. Did you see the review, man? Yeah, I saw the review. Damn, well, We'll talk later. Oh, come on, guys. Oh, sorry Bar. Hey, Barry. Kim, David. Did you see the review? Yep. Can't win 'em all. Nope. We're uh, we're gonna, we're just gonna get outta your hair, let you have the space to prepare. Thanks. Oh, look, fuck that guy, am I right? - Yeah. - Right. No, no no. Fuck that guy. Yeah. Break a leg. Where'd she, uh, where'd she go? Hi, are you Tom? - Yep, Phyllis? - Yes. Thank you. - No problem, headin' south? - Yessir. I've been very into manifesting, lately. What's that? Manifesting, like vision boards? It's all about the laws of attraction. There's this higher plane of existence, where your desires are not just a wish, but they're actually reality. Identifying your visions, and giving them clarity, and then focusing on that clarity, will manifest what you truly want in life. If you refuse the outside world, and prevent it from distracting you from your intentions, you can achieve anything you want. That's how I got this part. That sounds like bullshit. It's not. I read it in a book, and it works. That's how I got this part. You got this part because you were sl... Right, well, I wanna congratulate everybody, on a very successful run. Speech! Um, I know some of you have probably read the reviews, but I wanna say that I'm proud of you. In a time when space is limited, it's, you know, hey, hey, ♪ All the world is but a stage ♪ Life, life is a performance. Life is love. Art, art is love. Love art, and you love life. More importantly, love art in yourself. Mm, you're home. You fell asleep. - Yep. - Come on, let's go to bed. Carry me. Okay, but piggy-back style. - Really? - Yeah, let's do it. Whoa, whoa, whoa! How's this? Great. Do I look like a relaxed and friendly guy? Yes. Do I look like a hipster dad? Yes. Good. Barry? - Stand on the X. - Yeah. Okay, look straight into the camera, and slate your name. Barry Klein. Hands and two profiles, please. Um, no, hands first. Okay, great. And the agency wants to see a little personality, get to know you a bit. So I'm gonna ask you a question, and I want you to answer straight to the lens. And try to be helpful, but not pushy and standoffish, okay? What's in your refrigerator right now? Oh God, um, eggs, cheese slices, almond milk, um, oh, half a box of wine. I don't drink wine, personally, but my wife does, and she likes to take the bag out of the box, and just drink it straight from the spout. She calls it her adult juice box. Okay, great. Do you think this guy looks sad? I don't like his hair very much. Um, ask him a different question, and this time can he not be so sad-looking in the eyes? And ask him if he'd be willing to shave. I love shaving. Are you willing to shave? I yal, I, yes, I'll shave. Okay, let's try that again, and this time, try not to be so pouty and sad in the eyes, okay? They don't want you to be pathetic. You're happy! So, you'll shave, if you were offered this part? I would shave if I was offered the part. That's as good as it's gonna get. Let's move on. Good. And Barry, what's your favorite thing in the world? Hm. Hey Barry. God, you scared the shit outta me. Do you like this painting? It's different. It's mine. I should've known. You're Phyllis. Yep. Hm, thought it was that lady. No. You're an artist? I am. What is it? They're um, they're collages. Oh, like a scrapbook. More like an assemblage of different forms, and different techniques, that when utilized together, make a wholly new, unique work of art. What do they mean? They can mean whatever you want them to mean. That's art. What does art mean to you? Well, good art is an expression, where you share the world to someone in a way that, maybe they've known, but um, never really experienced. Have you experienced the world in a way I haven't? I don't, I don't know. Okay. Well, bye. Stop eating so much cheese. I can eat as much cheese as I wanna eat. I can see what they're goin' for, but it's just not there. Yeah, she's really struggling to be someone, instead of just embracing the chaos of uncertainty. Right, you can tell that the artist is conflicted, has no idea what she's doing. Plus, it's just boring, mediocre, and lacks any kind of identity. - Eh, it's garbage. - Total garbage. No, no, but it's actually garbage, though. It's got, like, pieces of trash in it. Huh, would you look at that. Oh, God. Barry, we're leaving. - Where are you going? - Home. You can't take that. Fuck you. Oh, hey, whoa whoa whoa whoa, what's up, what's up? I can't get my shoe off! - Okay, okay, this shoe? - Yes this shoe, Barry, yes, this shoe. Hey, you don't have to cry about a shoe. I can cry if I want. No, yes, yes yes yes, you can, you can. But don't cry here. This is a terrible place to cry. There's good places to cry and there's bad places to cry, and this is a terrible, bad place to cry. I shoulda gotten a job in finance. Like taxes, and shit? Uh huh. You don't think I could do it. Mm mm. No, you're not cut out for that. I'm not cut out for acting. We're just a couple of talentless hacks. No, we're not talentless. They're tasteless and tactless. Y'know, I was feelin' pretty bad, there. Cause I was getting all the criticism. But now that you're the worst artist, and I'm the worst actor, we're like, at the top of our game. It's different with art. You could get a bad review cause of a shitty director. With art, it's just me. So you think people are the problem? Yes, people are absolutely the problem. Like, I wanna get away from all the people. I could take a vacation. Go to the beach. Sand in the toes. Sun rising above the Gulf. Is there such a thing as a vacation from people? Like, get me away from all the people for a little bit, I'm good. Is that what you truly want? I truly want that, yes. Manifest it. Manifest it. You put it out in the universe, and it becomes reality. - Yeah? - Mmhmm. Okay. Oh, cosmic universe, unburden me from the plague of societal obligation. Rid the planet of all the people. I eschew the naysayers, and the critics, and let me live out my final days in solitude. With Barry. Did it work? I don't, I really don't know, cause I don't speak the language of the universe. Oh my. Well, it's worth a shot. Did you have any dreams last night? Yes, one. - You were a turtle. - I've always wanted - to be a turtle. - And I was a dove. But I was in a house, in a cage, and you were outside, and you weren't in a cage. But you were walking by, slowly, because you're a turtle. And I was singing like an angel. And you heard me through an open window, and you fell in love with me, even though you couldn't see me. And you were outside and free, and could do whatever you wanted. Go to Greece, or Antarctica. - Do turtles like the cold? - Doesn't matter, cause you didn't go. You started climbing the front stairs of the house, straight to me. But your little turtle legs were too short to make it up the stairs. But you tried, anyway. Forever. Until you died. I don't think I like your dream. Well it's my dream, not yours. True. Hey, babe, I think they forgot to deliver the paper this morning. I'm gonna run to the store. Okay. - Hey babe? - Mmhmm? Is it a holiday? Nope. Weird. Why? Well, the store was closed, and there's nobody outside. What do you mean, nobody? Steve? Hi, this is Jamie, with Artists' Space gallery. Leave me a message and I'll call you back. Straight to voicemail. It's impossible. Apparently not. But, we were joking. It was a joke! Evidently not. Was, was there an evacuation? We would've heard about it, wouldn't we? Maybe, we're hallucinating. We're both hallucinating the same thing? Maybe it's a dream. And my mind is telling me you're here, and I can feel you, but I can't actually feel you. Maybe? No, but when you dream, you don't, you don't know you're having a dream when you're in the dream. You don't know you had a dream until you wake up. And you've already had it, right? Then what the fuck is it? Fuck. Hey Bar? Barry. Bar. Barry? Phyl? Phyl? Oh my God! What's goin' on? Why is your hair wet? Did you know there's a creek behind the house? - What? - It's wild. If this is what the world is like, then we're all that we have. I know, I know. Now what do we do? Whatever the fuck we want. Tell me a story. About what? Anything. Okay. Mm, got it. This is an old one, so stop me if you've heard it. 'Kay. It was a particularly uneventful night, in the dead of winter. A man was traveling along a mountain path, when the breeze boasted to the hot sun, that it was truly the stronger of the two. I can topple trees, bury ships in the sea, and raise tidal waves larger than the tallest mountains, that can devastate even the mightiest of cities. The sun laughed. And of course, we all know that the sun is the most powerful thing in the solar system. Right. You dare tempt me, Wind? See that weary man, far below? Let us see who can take the coat off that man. If you can, you are truly the greatest. That is simple. The breeze swelled, and blew hard. The man clung hard to his coat, and no matter how strong the wind blew, he never relented. He only shivered, pulled his coat tighter. The sun stepped out from behind a cloud, and grew. Its heat warmed the air, and the frosty ground. The snow melted. The leaves of the trees shriveled, and turned to dust. The man grew hot, and sought refuge in the shade of a hill. He took off his coat, and rested. The breeze was dumbfounded. How did you do that? Not with force, but with gentleness. Then what? Well, that's kinda the end of the story, I guess. But what about the man? He dies, eventually. Shit. I'd be doing a show, and I would remember everything about the performance, leading up to it. And then I would sort of, come to, as the audience was clapping. Like there was a void in my memory of the entire show. Kinda like when you're driving, and you get to your destination, but you don't remember the drive? Yeah, like that. There's a sorta high, I guess. That's what I liked. You could perform for me. A private show? The whole world's our private show. Huh. I should've picked a more manly profession. Like a hunter. Or a lumberjack. Have you ever climbed a tree? You don't think I can? - Mm. - Watch this. Yeah, what's your first step? It's a gesture. You invite the viewer to move about the piece. They become an explorer. Dipping in and out of thought, through the nooks and the crannies, shifting in and out of light, and color. It's not meant to be one thing, but a complex collection of a variety of thoughts. Like a troubled, noisy mind, frozen in a moment. The individual pieces alone, are unique. And taken in as a whole can seem messy, but take a step back and the whole of the thing comes together as one. Wait, I think I know where we are. Oh yeah? I know this smell anywhere. Okay, open 'em. Oh yeah, it definitely smells like mildew and urine in here. Wait for it. Your co-star. Okay, what do you wanna see? Anything. Maybe something you remember from before. All right, um, oh, I got it. The scene takes place outside of a cafe. I was waiting. I was waiting on you, actually. And this stranger came up to me. She said, uh, well she said "Excuse me, "do you know what time brunch ends?" And I was like, I don't know. And she said "You don't know?" No. "How can you work at a place that serves brunch "and not even know what time it ends? "Isn't that like your one fucking job?" I don't work here. "You look like you work here." What? "You're wearing that black shirt, "and you're standing by the door, so..." If I worked here, wouldn't I be inside, working? "Look man, I don't know you, "you could be on your break or something." I'm just waiting for someone. "Oh my God, would you calm down? "It's just a simple fucking question." To somebody that doesn't know the answer. "Jesus, Yelp was right, this place is horrible. "And you know what, just go back "to whatever shithole you came from, you fuckin' tourist." But I was born here. I'm from here. Maybe the hipster girl's right. Maybe we should go somewhere else. Get away. Maybe. Hey, have you seen my blue velvet? Bar? What? My blue velvet, have you seen it? No, uh, I don't know. All right, let's get out of here. You wanna take this? No, nah, go ahead and grab it. I'll paint over it. What if there's somebody out there, and we don't even know it? Where would they be? I don't know. Where would we even start looking? I don't know. Racist people. Children. Stockbrokers. Bill Gates. And Mel Gibson. All of North Korea. Every artist you've ever known. And every actor, and every director, and every scientist, and politician, and schoolteacher. All the shitty ones, and all the good ones. Man, being an astronomer's kind of a bullshit job, isn't it? Like, all they do is look at stuff, and then write down what they saw. Like, oh look, that star just exploded, write it down. I mean, sometimes, that's all you have to do. You observe, and then interpret. Well, I guess that was inevitable. Phyl? Come inside. Okay. What are we doin' in a tent? Actually, it's an ancient Inuit structure, designed to keep us warm and safe from the outside elements of the arctic tundra. I know, it's made of ice, so you'd think it'd be freezing, but actually it keeps the warmth in. I feel it. Oh, wait for it. I found this little guy outside. How d'you think he got here? Oh, probably just went for a walk, got lost, wandered around for a bit, and next thing he knew, he was in the cold. Poor little guy. What are we doing here? Escaping the elements. We can't stay in here forever. Why not? We just can't. We'll die. I gotta get outta here. Please don't die before me. We could die together. Wanna make a suicide pact? If you died, I would die of a broken heart. We'd be like, wrapped in each others' arms, like the statues at Pompeii. I don't think there were any like that. Of course there were. They did find a guy masturbating. It happened. Okay, but you don't have to talk about it when we're having a moment. Well what do you want from me? What's your problem? Nothing. I'm just not excited about death. I didn't say that you were. Just fantasizing. Well death isn't somethin' to joke about. I'm not joking. When did you get so morbid? I'm not morbid. It's like you don't even wonder what this is all about. You sit around and turn this over and over and over, trying to figure it out. But the truth is, that we're never gonna know. So just snap out of it. I'm not like you, Phyl. I can't just turn on a dime. I can't help but feel the burden that I was left behind. Those thoughts are insidious. I'm surrounded by so much stuff. But for some reason, it feels like I'm standing in a room full of nothing, all the time. I'm there, too. Hey, hey! All I ever wanted was to be happy. I thought that's what you wanted, too. - I do, but... - No buts. - Yeah, but... - Barry! It's like you don't remember what a shithole it was. I remember. Well, do you wanna go back to all that shit that we endured? Back to that place that didn't want us? Fuck it all. That's why we're here. Fuck the electricity, and the cars, and buildings. We don't need any of it. We don't need the critics, and we don't need the shitty directors. Fuck it all. Fuck it all. Come on. Did we go the wrong way? I don't think so. But, shouldn't we be closer to the house by now? I guess, I guess let's just keep goin'. Maybe we took a wrong turn. Should we go back? I don't honestly know which way is back. The highway runs north to south, so if we go east or west, we'll run into it eventually, right? Yeah, that makes sense. Fuck, I shoulda been in the scouts. All right, which way is east or west? This way. Or this way. Let's go this way. Scouts, my ass. Holy shit. What should we do? Look. Lets get some rest. In the morning, I'll go up to that ridge, right there. When the sun's out, I'll see if I can see, something. Okay. Oh, oh God. I'd say something reassuring, like, I'm sure somebody's looking for us. I know it's not true. We've got the moon on our side. We got that goin' for us. Startin' to feel like a punishment. Fuck. Startin' to think it's all gone. I don't, I don't wanna be here anymore. And I want ice cream. I'm sorry. Don't apologize. Just let me think. Okay. Do you remember when we first met? At the bookstore? That, wasn't me. Oh. Ah, 'scuse me? What? Um, I'm looking for David. I'm the new set designer. Oh, okay. God, right. I'm an idiot. My idiot. - I miss that. - Me too. I liked when you'd watch me work. I don't like what we've become. Phyl, Phyl, Phyl! We never asked for it back. We never just asked for it back. No. We just need it reversed. What? We need to ask the universe to reverse it. Back the way it was. I don't even remember what I said. We asked the cosmic universe for privacy. So un-ask for it. Oh, cosmic universe, um, undo what has been done, and return the people of Earth to Earth. I'm sorry for what I asked for, and, and, um, and I didn't mean it. I think we just wait til morning. What are you doing? I'm building a house. Why? I liked our house. We need to rebuild again. I'm sick and tired of wandering around the woods. We should keep going. And go where? East, like you said. And do what? We might, find something. I know exactly what we're gonna find. Over there, is more trees. And guess what, over there, more trees. Will you stop acting like that? How am I supposed to act when I'm lost in the fucking woods? I'm annoyed, and I'm tired of being surrounded by trees. You're yelling at a tree. I don't like trees. You want the trees to be gone? Yes. Okay, well kicking them isn't gonna get rid of them. You're kicking a tree. We should just keep moving. We can go anywhere we want. You wanna go to the ocean, watch the sun rise over the Gulf? Let's go! We can go anywhere. But we're not gonna get there with you acting like a baby. I don't like being lost. Well then, let's get out of the woods! If I leave, I'm not sure I'll find my way back to you. There's a better chance of us finding something if we're looking together. No. Every time we go anywhere, the world as we know it changes. We should just be happy with what we've got. I'm staying right here. Is that what you want? I wanna build a house. A place for us to be us again. We don't need a house for that. You've got to be fucking kidding me! What the? Nice, isn't it? You said you hated the trees, wanted to be in the sand. Yeah. In the, Hawaii, or Greece, or something. Not in the middle of the fucking desert! You coulda done anything to us. You coulda turned me into a little cockroach. Or one of those little rats that just shits everywhere. You coulda done anything! And you do this? You put us in a place that's incapable of sustaining life? Barry, who are you talking to? Whatever god is up there. Toying with us. You know? Just playin' with us, like we're in a little ant farm. He's got a magnifying glass, he's burnin' away everything we love. But guess what. Guess. I don't even, honestly know what it is... I can kick whatever I want to kick! What? You're laughing. Yeah. I can't remember the last time that you laughed. Huh, well, I think I finally get it. What do you get? All this. No matter how far we get from the world, it's always gonna be a pretty shitty place for us. There's always gonna be some greater power, that's pushin' down on our happiness. Some Zeus, bringin' in a flood, takin' everything away. 'Til we got nothin'. Nothin' except someone who understands all of that. Yeah. Wanna build a sand castle? This is nice. Isn't it, though? The waves, the breeze. The sun, sand. You know what, screw the sun. We don't need it. Screw the stars, screw the moon, screw everything in the universe. You really wanna try your luck with that one? Oh, I made you something. - For me? - Yeah! And you got your vacation. And I got us here. What did you say? You got your vacation, and I got you. What? You said you wanted to be away from all the people, now we're away from all the people. Right. I wanted a vacation. Rid the planet of all the people. Let's get out of the woods. We don't need a house for that. You wanna go back to all that? To that shit that we endured? We don't need any of it, that's why we're here. Fuck the electricity, fuck the buildings, fuck it all. It's you. What? It's been you this whole time. What are you talking about? Whatever you've wanted, you've gotten. That's ridiculous. No, no, there's no greater force at work here. It's just you! I don't understand what's happening right now. You did this. Did what? All of this! Everything you want, you get. No, that's not true. - Yes it is. - Barry. Yes it is! There's no greater force pushing down on me, it's just you! All I've ever done is support you! - No! - Yeah. - No. - Yes I have! You're selfish! You're selfish. What's gotten into you? You say that you just want to be with me. You just wanna make yourself happy. You don't care about anything else. No, that's not - true at all. - Yes it is. - Why would you think that? - Yes it is. You wanted this. You wanted this. All I ever wanted was to be with you. - That's not true! - Yes it is, Barry stop. - Don't come near me! - Barry, stop, please. I don't wanna see you again! Please, could you just stop? No, no no no no. Barry, no no, Barry? Barry, Barry Barry Barry Barry. Oh my God, oh my God! I don't want this. I don't want this, I don't want anything if I don't have you. No. Barry? Where are you? I can't see you. Barry! Please come back to me! Please!
