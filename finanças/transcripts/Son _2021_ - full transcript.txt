My God! You don't know death before your God. Do you understand the horror that's gonna fill your soul? Seeing and Satan... What, you think that you're just gonna live forever, until you realize... ...and sorrow and burning in hell! Can you imagine what that will be like? Can't change it. Can't change your life. You may be dead before the sun goes down! No, no, no, no, no! No, no, no, no! No, no! No! Fuck! No! No! I don't want you! I don't want you! No! No! No! No! No! No! Ooh... Officials and decision-makers across the state. The Gallo Radio Show on SuperTalk Mississippi. Race ya! You can't just announce a race and not give me a chance. That is completely unfair. - And the judge rules... - And I'll race you back! Get your butt over here. We have to go to school. You're gonna be late. Fine. Fine. March it. Hey! Oh, hey, guys! - Oh, hey, Susan! - Hey, David. Um, you still good to pick him up today, right? Yeah. No problem. I have that late class tonight, so... it'll be later than usual. I'll see you guys later. - Bye! - Thank you. Alright. Don't forget your seatbelt. Yep. - Mom... - Yeah. ...I need to ask you something serious. What? If you had eight arms, what would you do with the extra ones? Would you hide them down your top? Or show them off? - Aaah! No, no, no! Stop! - You're such a little butt! Why would you scare me like that? I'm serious! Seriously. - I'm serious. - Okay. Okay. I will take it seriously, but I need to think about it, because I'm gonna take it extra seriously. Think about it while your driving... - I will. - ...because school starts - in five minutes. - We'll get there. Okay. Go. Have a good day. I love you. Bye, Mom. Love you. Hey! I wouldn't hide my eight arms down my top. I would just show them off and call myself a spider lady. Good answer, Mom. "A" is for... Apple! Beautiful. "B" is for... Ball! Fabulous! "C" is for cow. Excuse me! A child with PTSD will often have a intense focus on death. And while it is normal for some kids to be curious about death, others with trauma will often develop an obsession with it and worry excessively about their own safety, or the safety of their loved ones. Mommy! - Hi, munchkin. - Hey. - How'd it go? Good? - It was great. We just ate, and he finished all of his homework. - Amazing. Thank you. - All of my homework. - For the rest of the week! - Good job, buddy. Thank you, Susan. We'll see you tomorrow, okay? - See you. Bye, David! - Bye! Mom, can I play video games before bed? Maybe. Mom... Yeah, sweetie. I need my gym clothes tomorrow. I already have them waiting for you. Thanks, Mom. You're the best. You're welcome. - Now go to bed. - Wait, wait, wait. Don't shut off the night light. Just in case there's zombies hiding in the dark. That's why we're not supposed to play scary games before we go to bed. - Uh... - Um... Okay. Goodnight. David? I told you you were gonna get scared. What do you know. Come on in. You can sleep with me tonight. Oh, come on. Mommy loves when you sleep in her bed. Don't feel bad. David! David, wake up! Help! Help, somebody! Somebody, help, please! Help! Help! Susan... Susan, help! Help! Susan! Susan! Help! Susan, hurry, hurry! Susan! There are people in my house. Call the police! There are people in David's room. - Laura, who do I call? - Call the police! Okay! David. David! David! David! David! David. David. David, wake up. Wake up. Can you hear me? David, can you hear me? Mom? Alright. Alright. So I'll check these, your neighbor's, and your son's off the prints that I found. Um... We couldn't find any evidence of forced entrance on any of the windows or doors. Could you have left a window or a door open, do you think? No. I always lock the doors and the windows, and then I double check that I locked them, and then do that again and again. So, no, no. I'm OCD that way. Is there a spare key, perhaps? Does a neighbor or anyone have a spare? No. Did you lose a key? Or have one stolen? Uh... No, I don't... No. No. No. Mnm-mnm. Think you could have been dreaming? A lucid dream, maybe? Maybe you went into your son's room sleepwalking, stripped him, went back to your room. It can happen. No, I've never sleepwalked a day in my life. It happened. Those people were here. It was real. Have you been under stress lately? Recent break-up, loss of a loved one? Why do you think these people were here? Who were they? I don't know. You tell me. You're the police. Uh, Steve, w... why don't you head back to the station. I'll... I'll finish up here. Copy that. Those people were here, alright? Those people were here. It happened. I did not imagine it. I believe you. You do? Yeah. Now, the doctors... they couldn't find anything physically wrong with your son. So, my guess is that you interrupted these people just before they had time to do whatever they wanted to do. - Right. - But don't worry, okay? We'll fucking get them. Excuse me. What are you doing? I was sleeping. I'm sorry. Were there really people in my room? You don't remember anything? No. Do you remember if you took your jammies off... in the middle of the night? I'm not sure. Sweetie, this is very, very, very important. I need you to remember... if you took your jammies off in the middle of the night. I think I did. I was too hot. Okay. That's okay. Mom? Yeah. I was dreaming. What about? I was drowning. I was drowning in a river of blood. Alright. Exactly like that. You dip it... I did it. ...and you flick it. You didn't find a single print? Other than you, your neighbor, and your son's, no. Are you okay? Sort of. Alright. Well, it's gonna take you a while to get back to normal. People breaking into your home is just such a... violation. You know, my son... he said that he could have taken his pajamas off in the middle of the night. He said that he does that sometimes. But those people... Those people were there. If you need anything... here's my card. Call me anytime, okay? Oh, thank you, Detective Tate. Yeah. Oh, you can call me Paul. Wake up honey. Mom? Yeah. I have a headache - and my stomach feels sick. - Okay. Well, it's probably 'cause you haven't eaten anything today. That's probably why. And if you still feel sick in the morning, I will take you to the doctor. Don't worry. I got you. Got to sleep. Nothing. Here you go. It's... I didn't know if you wanted sugar or... You know, I really don't think they're gonna be back here, Laura. I mean, whoever they were, they must know that... the police are watching. I saw them, though. But I'm thinking that they must have came in through the back garden. Right? It's the only explanation left. So... I'll have my guys check for footprints in the morning. I have a feeling that they'll come with something. Right. Mom? David, are you okay? It really hurts. Jesus. What is that? David. David... I'll just, uh... I'll wait out here, okay? Can you stay? I just want someone to be with me. Absolutely. Yeah. We thought at first, it was bacterial meningitis, as the symptoms are quite similar, but the tests turned up negative. Because of the severe gastrointestinal bleeding, we checked for trauma, tumors, ulcerative colitis, and parasites. Negative. We then tested for all other viral and bacterial infections and various diseases, including tropical diseases, known degenerative diseases, poisons, and narcotics... but everything turned up negative. Oh. Okay. So...? So... Laura... can I be honest with you? As a parent myself, if I were in your position, I know that's what I'd want. We don't know what this is. We're still testing, and, of course, we'll continue to test, but I'm afraid time is against us. His condition is worsening by the second, and we can hardly keep up. I think you should prepare yourself for the possibility... the distinct likelihood that David isn't gonna wake up. I'm sorry. Uh... Those people... Those... Those... Those people. Those people that were in his room... Th-They gave him something then. Poison. Well, like I said, we checked for poisons. W-Well, then something else. - Like what? - I don't know. Something else... Something that doesn't show up. I don't know what that is. Paul, does this make any sense? I... Laura, I assure you, if someone gave him something, it would have shown up. There's nothin'. Mommy's right here. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry that this is happening to you, baby. I'm so sorry I couldn't do anything to help make it better. If you have to go... then it's okay. I know you do. I know you hurt. I know you hurt. Help, somebody! Nurse, doctor, somebody! Get in here! Help! Help! Yeah, I-I don't know what's happening. I think he's coughing up blood again. - I'll get the doctor. - Hurry! Hurry, please! Hurry, please! Hurry, please! Hurry! Baby, can you hear me? Can you hear me? Help, somebody! Doctor, hurry, please! David. David! David, it's Dr. Bond. Open your eyes. Open your eyes. Can you hear me? Mommy... Hi, baby. Mommy... Hi, sugar. Eat an apple... It makes me happy. 'Cause apples are the candy of the forest. You've been working on it all dinner. I think it's time to unveil it to us. Thank you so much. What do you say? Thanks. - She gave you fortune cookies. - Fortune cookies. Thank you! Well, I wonder what the fortune is. This is my zombie-killing sword. It has six spikes. - 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. - Eat you fortunate cookie, man. - Look at your fortune. - Oh, yeah. Mine says... you will one day achieve greatness. - Huh? - You hear that? - Ooh! - That sounds pretty good. "Money can't buy everything. You can buy a doctor, but you can't buy health." - Wow. - I don't get it. What does yours say? "Do something unusual today." I got to go to the bathroom. Do you know where it is? It's literally right over there. Okay. It's amazing. It's like he was never even sick at all. Yeah, the doctors still have no idea what it was. We're just... We're chalking it up to a miracle. I'm happy before you. I think that, um... I'm gonna put the house on the market. I think we're gonna sell and just get out of here. You know, start over someplace new. Laura, I feel that whatever happened was a one off, and that... I mean, that's your home. Right? You can't get scared out of your home. Yeah. Yah! Aaah! Can we just go? Can you take a few bites? No. David, you haven't eaten anything today. We don't want it. I'm not hungry. He's completely exhausted. He's out cold. Well, he's had a long... a long day, huh? He's fond of you. - You think? - Yeah. Yeah, I can tell. He doesn't like everyone. Thank you, Paul, for everything. It's been... Thank you. You're welcome, you know. Just doing my job, - I'll get out here. - Wait. Just... Can you say? Laura... you're safe here. I promise you, you don't have anything... You don't have anything to worry about, okay? I promise. - I don't know if... - Just stay, please. I... I-I like you, Laura. Just say just tonight. Are you sure about this? Alright. What happened? A junkie cut me up the other night. It's one of the perks of the job. David? - No... - We're still testing. We have a lot more testing to do. Dr. Bond, I called you three times over the weekend. I called you three times, and I said that he wasn't eating. He wasn't drinking. He was doing all of these things that he had done before, before he got sick. And you said he's fine. You said he's totally fine. W-Why would anything else be wrong with him? - This is a miracle. - I need you to stay stay calm. - He's not fine! - I need you to stay stay calm. Stay calm? Oh, my God. I can get you something to help you relax. No. Paul... I haven't been completely honest with you about everything. I was raised in a cult. I... escaped eight years ago, and... I... I wasn't sure if it was them, but now I know. They were the people that were in his room. I know there were people - that started all of this. - Laura. You can come in now. Laura...? Please. Please stay with us. Laura. You have no idea what they're capable of. Okay. Yeah. Shhhh. Say the words. They're waiting for us downstairs. We have to handle it quietly. Wait till she falls asleep. The boy is the priority. - You understand? - Yes, sir. - Do you understand? - Yes, doctor. Okay, baby. Okay. Okay. I got you, baby. I got you, baby. Okay. Shh. Shh. Shh. Shh, baby. Shh. I know. Everything alright back there? Okay, baby. Alright. Okay. I'm just gonna run next door, and I'm gonna get money and clothes a-and my car, and then I'll be right back, okay? No. No, Laura. I can't be a party to that. You have to take him back. Just let him lie here for a few minutes, Susan. - Look at him. - You saw at the hospital, They did nothing for him. They did nothing. Just let him like here for a few minutes, and I'll be back in a few. What if I take him back while you're gone? You would not do that because you are a friend. You're our friend, okay? Okay. Please just take care of him while I'm gone. I'll be back. Come closer. - Laura, where are you? - Don't ask me any questions. Just meet me outside of David's school in an hour, okay? Laura, everyone is looking for you. Just promise me, Paul! Promise me. Okay. I-I'll see you there. Don't trust anybody. Everybody is in on it. Everybody... The doctors, everybody at the hospital. "In on it"? What, in the cult? They're gonna be coming for us. Bring your gun. Laura... Susan! Dav... David... I feel better now, Mom. Towel is so warm. Okay. Mom... are we staying with Susan tonight? No, I just need you to rest right now, so that's what we're gonna do. Okay? Okay. I'll try. Cool. I love you, Mom. I love you, too, sweetie. This is a cool room. Mom, look what's on. Hey, buddy, that's not for you. Turn that off. You know that. I've see this one, but it's super funny. Mom... Do you think that this room has fleas? - No. - I don't think it does. Try to get some sleep, okay, bud? Okay. A couple more minutes. And then right to bed, okay? Okay. Fine. Police say the mother seen here in this photograph with her son has a history of a mental illness and may have suffered a complete mental breakdown... Mom... we're on TV. ...the degenerative disease is returned to hospital within 48 hours... I'm scared. Police appeal to the public to stay vigilant... Mom... are we going? Is Forensics here yet? No, sir, not yet. Got a good one. Take a look. Mm-hmm. Think she's dead? ICK Kansas Radio has just received further weather reports from the Kansas City area. Where are we going? We're going to see an old friend of mine. Who? Somebody that I knew when I was a kid. Why? He'll definitely be able to help me remember a few things just... a little bit more clearly. I'll have the first autopsy report ready for you within the hour. Better take a look at this. So, should I ask for a new partner on this? No, I'm fine. Are you in a relationship with Laura? What? What are you talking... Are you fucking her or are you not? Okay. - We made out, Steve. - Mm-hmm. But does that mean I'm in a relationship? No. She couldn't have done this. Okay? I know she couldn't. She was in a fuckin' mental institution, right? For trauma. So, who did it then? - This cult. - Was a pedophile ring And maybe that's what she meant. There are pedophile cults. They're fucking cults, Steve. They're crazy. They'll do anything. They could have killed Susan trying to get to the boy, or trying to silence Laura. Pedophile cults. Let's just find her and bring her in. If this is real, she needs our protection. And what if it's not? Then at the very least, we need to find the boy and bring him back to the hospital before he dies. Hi, Mrs. Naegle. It's... It's me. It's Anna. Anna Hansen. I know who you are. Is that the boy? Is that your father... This is... He doesn't know anything... Know about what, Mom? Nothing, sweetheart. Do you wanna listen to some music while Mrs. Naegle and I talk about something, okay? - Okay. - Okay. Poor child. How could something so beautiful and innocent like you... come out of such evil? She's crazy. Mrs. Naegle... um... I... really need to talk to Jimmy. Do you know where he is? When did you get out of the institution, Anna? A while ago. We lost Jimmy to drugs. He's been in and out of prison these past five years. He stole from me a couple times and drove his father to an early grave. You know, for years... I blamed you for what happened, for introducing him to your father. Then, of course, that's ridiculous. You were just a child, like Jimmy. It wasn't your fault. Please. I really need to know where he is. I'm sorry. He went south. Clarksdale, Mississippi. An awful place. Calachmont Square. Can I help you? Hi, uh, Tracy. I'm looking for a doctor by the name of Nathan J. Bradlee. I'm afraid Dr. Bradlee retired a couple of years ago. - You know where I can find him? - I'm sorry, I don't think I'm supposed to give out that information. Oh, it's okay. He's not in trouble or anything like that. I'm a police officer. I just need to ask him a couple of questions. Are there patients here? It's awfully quiet. People always expect screaming, but the patients here are quiet mostly, I find that scarier. Don't you? This place gives me the creeps. I have nightmares about it. Why do you work here then? It's better than McDonalds. Yeah, well... that's a good point. Watch your step. It's a big one. - Okay. - There's a dog. There is a dog. Doesn't the garbage man ever come here? I don't think so, babe. Don't touch anything, okay? And especially when we go inside. Don't touch anything. Okay. Okay. I don't feel so good. We're gonna be out of here in a few minutes, okay? Jimmy. Hi. Anna? Can I speak with you for a minute? Who's that? Uh, this is my son, David. He's from a previous marriage. Can you say hi to Jimmy? This was Mommy's friend when I was a kid. You want to say hi? Hi. Do you mind if we come in? Anna was the most extraordinary case. She had suffered such terrible abuse in her life that she had retreated into a fantasy world. Was Anna psychotic? She had an extreme psychotic episode, yes. The truth is that her father would pimp her out to other men for money, her and a little local boy named Jimmy Naegle. Well, Laura... or... Anna thinks that this cult may still be out there. - She thinks... - There was never any cult, no conspiracy or any other fantasies that she's now trying to perpetuate. It was all in our head. What happened to the other child? I was born dead. I-I-I really wanted to go and see you at the hospital, Anna, b-but... but they wouldn't let me in. They tried to tell me I was crazy, too, but I wouldn't let them lock me up. Those psychiatrics, they fuck you up in the head. Yeah, they had me on so many medications that when I was discharged, I couldn't remember anything. Was it like that for you? No. I-I remember it all. What do you remember? You... You happen to have a light on you? - I-I don't have mine. - No, Jimmy, I don't. I'm sorry. Please. They... They'd conduct these ceremonies where they'd kill and torture animals in front of us. U-Usually in your bedroom. T-Then they'd make you begin your chanting. Chanting? You were the only one who could do it. That's why they said you were special, th-th-they all tried, but you were the only one. Your father taught you. Taught me? What did he teach me? They called your Palestine. The Huntsman. Th-The demon. You'd make him rise from Hell. T-Then they'd let the Huntsman rape you. Jimmy, that can't... that can't be. You know it's true, Anna. You know I'm telling the truth. I wouldn't... I wouldn't lie to you. My father is the one that raped me. I remember that. I remember those men. Th-They're false memories. You were sacred, Anna. Th-Th-They would have never dared touch you. You were meant for the demon... Shh! - You were abused. - No, that never happened! I didn't happen like that. Okay? Okay. I'm sorry. Jimmy, I'm afraid, though. I'm really afraid. Because if I... if I let all these things back into my brain... that just means that I'm slipping back into psychosis, which is exactly what the doctor said would happened. Everything I've said is true. Mom... my skin hurts here. You're as sane as I am, Anna. Everything hurts. Where are you? I'm headed home. I just passed through Little Rock. Any luck with Jimmy? Yeah. I talked to his mother Laura followed him to Clarksdale. Fuckin' Mississippi? Yeah. Look, I'll meet you there in the morning. Wait for me. I'm about three hours behind you. We should talk to him together. Alright. I don't like it here. We're not gonna be here long, okay? Just till we figure out what to do. When I say drink this shit, drink it. Better drink that. There you go. - I know. - Get the fuck off me. What's up, mama? Why don't you come over and hang out with us. Come on. We'll have some fun with you. There you go, really slow. Really, really, really slow. Really slow. I know, sugar. I know. There you go. There you go. Okay. Okay. Okay. Shh. It hurts! It hurts so bad! - Shh. - I'm scared, Mom! I don't want to die. Hey, none of that. You're not going to die. I am right here. You are gonna be okay. Okay? Shh. Sing that song that you used to sing for me. Okay. So close those eyes. No, shhh! Wake up, honey. It's time again. Say the words. Mom, it hurts! - It hurts! - Shh! It hurts so bad! I'm gonna die! - Okay. Okay. Okay. - I'm gonna die! Mom, come back! Mom! Mom, get me some food! Get me some fuckin' food, you bitch! Get me some food! I need it! Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. It's okay. Okay. Hey... Hey. Hey. Baby... Okay. Okay. Okay. Shh. Shh, shh. Shh, shh. Shh, shh. I need food. I... need... food. I need food. Please, Mom. By Astaroth, your prince, by your master Lucifer... appear before me now. That's my girl. I want my fuckin' money! Yeah, you got it. I know you fuckin' do. You owe me that fuckin' money! Bitch! Yeah, see, I knew you got it! Bitch! The fuck are you looking at? Huh?! What can I do for you, little mama? I'd like for you to come to my room and fuck me. Not here. I want to do it in the bathroom. I... I want you to take yours off first. I wanna... I wanna look at your body. Take your fuckin' clothes off! Now! Take that fuckin' shirt off! Aaah! Get off me! Help! Help! Get off me! Get this off of me! David: Mommy, wake up.

Jimmy, your mother told us where we could find you. We're looking for Anna Hansen. Has she been here? Jimmy, it's the police. Shit. Yeah. Got an address? Copy that. She used her credit card to check out of a nearby motel at 4:00 a.m., just around the corner. We got to call local PD. Alright. - Mom? - Hmm? I was dreaming. I was flying and I was looking down at everyone. And I could see you and my school and everything. It was so cool. Sounds cool. Then I raised my hands like this, and the world cracked in half. There was fire and everything. Buildings were burning. People were screaming like 9/11. Were you scared? Uh-huh. But I was okay. I was like a superhero or something. Wow. Like that blue guy that was in the movie we saw. Yeah. Nothing could touch me. Mm-hmm. Sweet pea. You know how you've been sick? Uh-huh. - So... - What about it? Your illness... it seems that it's getting closer and closer every time. Which means that you're gonna probably get sick again really soon. Okay, it's gonna come on really quick, and it's gonna be really painful. But you're gonna help me, right? I'm gonna be here by your side holding your hand. But I'm not gonna be able to help. - Why not? - Because I can't. I can't do anything. Mom, stop crying. Please. - I hate it when you cry. - Shh. Do you want to do something fun today? There's a carnival that's nearby. It's inside, and they have a carousel. I want to go. I want to go. Can we? Yeah, we can go. Yes. We can go when it gets dark. Okay? Okay. Okay, now go to sleep. Is it dark yet? No. Laura was seen last night taking this pimp to her motel room. You know it's her doing this, right? Nobody's following her around killing everybody that she meets. It's her. No fucking satanic cult. No pedophile ring. It's her. Tell them to go easy on her, Steve, when they find her. Even if she's the one doing this, she may not know it herself. - I tripped. - Way off. I tripped a little. Aah! You okay? What's going on, baby? Let me see, let me see. Jesus. Come on, come on. It's okay. I'm right here, baby. I'm right here with you. Come on. We're almost there. We're almost there. Come on. Come on. It's okay, baby. You're good. You're good. Okay, okay. You're okay. You're okay. You're okay, sugar. You're okay. No, no, no, don't look at that. Don't look at that. I know it hurts. I know it hurts, but look at me. Look at me. Look at me. Look at me. It doesn't have to hurt. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Don't look down. Just look at me. Look at me. I'm right here with you. - Mom. - No. - Aah! It hurts, Mom! - I know. I know. I know. I know. - I need help. - I'm sorry, baby. Are you really not gonna help me? - I can't. - What if I die? I need help. I can't. I can't. - But, Mom! - I need you to trust me. Mom! - Get the boy. - Get the boy. Hey, Laura. Stop! - Mom! - David, David, are you okay? Mom. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Move your hand. I got it, I got it. I got it. Fuck. It won't stop. Please help me. It's okay. It's okay. Lift up your head. Lift up your head. Lift up your head. No, no, stay with me. Look at me, look at me, look at me. No, no, no, no, no, no. No. Look, don't be scared. We have to go. Laura, hello? Paul, I don't know what to do or who to turn to. Okay, Laura... I did not mean to kill him. I did not mean to kill your friend or any of those men, I swear to you. Your friend, he died in my arms. You have to turn yourself in, Laura. I still might be able to help you, okay? I-I-I know you're not well. I just panicked and I fired and I did not mean to. Laura. Just tell me where you are. I have to go back now. No. Go... Go back where? Back where it all started. - No, no, Laura. - Goodbye, Paul. Listen carefully to me, okay? Everything that you think has been happening and is true is not, okay? It's all fantasy. It's all in your head. - I'm sorry. - Wait, don't hang up. Fuck! Can you hear me? Can you hear me, baby?
