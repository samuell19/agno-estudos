MUST REFUGE TO AN UNDERGROUND FACILITIES OR THE SAME AFTER A NUCLEAR ATTACK WARNING. AFTER 2 WEEKS, ROUTINE ACTIVITIES CAN CONTINUE WHEN RADIOACTIVE LEVEL DOWN TO 1/1,000. National Disaster Safety Portal National Instructions for Nuclear & Radioactive Charge of Korea PAN-GYO Luxurious Residential Area This is a breaking news to announce nationwide that an unidentified launch vehicle. That is presumed to be an airborne ballistic missile has been captured by the military authorities this afternoon around 1:05 am. The unidentified launch vehicle is currently flying south towards the capital area. The whole nation is required to follow the National Instruction on Nuclear Attacks. Where are all the suitcases? The suitcase. Why can't you ever keep things organized where they belong? What the heck are you saying? You took it saying that you're going to Thailand next week to play golf. God Damn! I'll be back in a while. - Where do you think you're going? - I need to see Minho. Not now! But Minho and I promised to meet at the our institute and travel from there. Stop saying nonsense and go pack your bag. Now! We don't have a time, hurry up! Ji-seon! Go on! Oh, right! - Ji-seon! Where are you going? - My charger! Ji-seon! Ji-seon! Come here! Fast! Honey! Look! Let me through! You both come here! And help me! - What are you trying to do? - Got to block the light from spilling through here, don't you think! You two hang on to this here! 지하실 THE BASEMENT Are you all right? - Ha-yeon! - Ji-seon! DAY 1 Are you alright, Ji-seon? Mom, are we going to die now? Ji-seon, that's nonsense. Your hand! Are you okay? For fuck's sake. It looks fine from the outside... But let's go to the doctor later. We've got no power? What are we going to do? It's alright, Ji-seon. We're safe as long as we're here. What do you mean "safe"? What about the others? Are they all dead? Was that really a nuclear bomb? Have we really been nuked? Dad, say something! What happened? What the hell happened? Ji-seon. You have to calm down. What does this mean? Read this. I've got it, too. You've left it somewhere again, haven't you? Typical. What? - The travel bag with the clothes... - You didn't bring it? - Damn it... - Just great! Let me see. Urgent Rewrite: "Fellow Koreans, when you receive information about a nuclear attack, evacuate to an underground facility as soon as possible." "After 2 weeks of evacuation, the strength of anti-magnetic ability is 1/1,000 It is possible to have an overall movement at the level. Hey, listen. Let's endure it for just two weeks. Then we'll be able to go outside. The government wouldn't lie through an emergency message. Nuclear attack... Then did everyone really die? it's unbelievable. How can it all end just like that? Nothing's ended. There's nothing to worry about. You'll be able to go to school and meet your friends again. What about grandma and grandpa? Hello? Mom? Can you hear me? Yes. Not too well, though... We're okay... We came to the basement of the house. Thank God. I'm so glad. Your father and I are at the evacuation shelter at the communications office. Thank God! Everyone in the family is safe... I imagine there are other people there, too? Did you bring everything you need? What? It's We've got no power here and... Mom, just a second... Are you okay, grandma? And grandpa, too? Is that you, Ji-seon? I hurt my leg... - Jung-sook... - Yes, it was... - It was quite a shock wasn't it? - Dongbaek, are you okay? I'll take good care of Ha-yeon and Ji-seon... Hello? Can you hear me? Why did it get cut? It's not working anymore... But shouldn't it have not worked since the nuclear bomb explodes? How did it get connected? There are several control centers all over the country. So it may have been working momentarily. Just like they back up data in case something happens. Can't we go to the shelter now like the others? It's suffocating. Dad, do something! Ji-seon, please. How do you suggest we go out right now? There's radiation everywhere. It's still there even if we can't see it. Grandpa and grandma are fine, So let us, too, endure it here for 2 weeks. No, I don't want to! Let me see what we have in the basement. What is it? TOEIC material I studied in college. You still haven't thrown that away? Why does the phone work but not the radio? I don't know. Perhaps the station got destroyed. Dad... Dad... I want to pee. - What? - I said I want to pee... Um... Okay... Don't you remember when you were a baby? You're the only person who ever used it. Who else? Dad. - Yes? - The light. Right. Don't look. You too, mom. I'm serious. Pour it down the drain when you're done. You bought thousands of dollars' worth of camping equipment anhd made such a fuss about it, just to end up going camping once or twice a year, didn't you? Only now they're being put to good use... Do you really have to put it that way? It's not like I bought it to use it just by myself... You always do and enjoy everything by yourself. Have you ever taken your family on a trip? Every weekend, you just go play golf. What did you ever do for your family? Next week's plan to go golfing to Thailand with the CEOs of executive companies of autonomous driving... I probably won't be able to go... What? You are kidding me? Golfing, my ass. You're really thinking of that in this situation? You think others have nothing better to do? I have to start rehearsing the show next week, too. Show? You never mentioned it. I so did. You never listen to me, that's why you had no idea. I told you 2 weeks ago. I'm so sick of this... Enough, both of you. Can't you hold a normal conversation without arguing? It's because your father is always so immature. Cut it out. Do you really have to be like that now? Your father always annoys me so much. What did I do? Forget about it. DAY 2 I think it's boiling... Try putting it in now. No. What's the matter? Sure, we're leaving this place in a few days... But still...water is most critical now. We have to save on it as much as possible. Okay. Just let this one time go. Mom! It's just too salty. Ji-seon, lets save on water, like your father says. Eat a little bit. How careless of you... Ha-yeon! Ha-yeon! Ha-yeon! Are you home? Are you home? Ha-yeon! Are you home? Ha-yeon! It's me. Sangme's mother. - It's Sangme's mom. - Shh. Quiet down. I can't reach either Sangme or my husband. Could you let me in if you're in there? I'm too scared to be home alone... What are you doing? Let's open the door for her. Hold on! Ha-yeon. Let me in if you're there. Dad, are you serious? Ha-yeon! Open up if you're there! - Let go of me. I'm opening the door. - Listen to me, Ji-seon. I said let go! Don't go. God damn it! I said let go! Let go of me! - Let go of me! - Just let her go! - Don't go. - No! You'll die if you go! It's hot! Too hot... Mom! It's suffocating. I can't breathe. Help... Is anyone there... Help me... Help... It's black rain... - Black rain... - What...? Black rain caused by fallout, radiation and dust is falling... You get exposed to that and you die... Now we can't go out even if we wanted to... When I was in civil defense training, I saw a video of the bomb being dropped and the people in Hiroshima in Japan. You may die as the bomb is dropped... But if you're exposed to radiation by fallout and stuff... You die in terrible pain. Radioactivity is horrific. Dad, how could you? What? Sangme's mother... If you had opened the door, she would have alive. I just told you, Ji-seon. There's a lot of radiation out there. Whatever! Still... She'd have survived if only we open the door. Dad, are you really that cruel? - Ji-seon. - You always only think of yourself. If I had opened the door... We would have all died of radiation exposure. That was why! But still... How could you... Ji-seon! Your father did what he did to save our family. Like the text message says, let's go outside... Once the radioactivity levels are somewhat down in two weeks. - Okay? - What if the situation is still bad in two weeks? Then, we wouldn't be able to go out even then? And how would we know if the outside situation is better from in here? The station will probably be fixed in a few days, and the radio would work then. We will turn on the cell phone from time to time to see the situation outside. Ji-seon! This is not the time to cry! Why do you get angry rather than comfort your daughter? Don't worry too much, Ji-seon. We'll be alright. What about grandma and grandpa? Let's wait a bit! They're alright... Grandma and grandpa are both at the shelter. They'll be safe there. I can't trust that. Let me call grandma... Not now, Ji-seon. This is not the time! Ji-seon! We have to save on battery. We can always charge! What? I said "charge". Listen to yourself. Can't you see we're out of power? Shit! I hate this! It feels like all of this is like a dream. Still, I'm glad you insisted on building and living in a detached house in Pan-Gyo. If we hadn't moved here... I don't even want to think about it... Right. We lived in Gangnam (a.k.a. Beverly Hills) for Ji-seon's school... But imagine that we still lived there... Sure, the apartment prices would have gone up if we stayed in Gangnam but... We wuold have all died immediately. Mom, you alright? I guess I inhaled some dust overnight. I'm fine now. DAY 5 Why aren't you eating? - Mom! - What's the matter? Do you feel sick? No... I can't eat because of that smell. Alright, I'll do something about it later. Wait. Let's be wary, Ji-seon. It's only 5 days. But the food supply is running out faster than I'd thought. We have to save on food. Pay attention. Okay. It's not like I did it on purpose or anything. Yes, let her a break. Ji-seon didn't do it deliberately. Maybe next time you can feed me, dad. You're not a baby. That's the sound of a combat plane, isn't it? Yes, I think so... Where do you think it's from? South Korea or North? Or America? Well... I wouldn't know what going on. We'd only know once we go outside. So frustrating... Let's take care of this first so that it doesn't smell. What's that, dad? It's name is Stinky Fart. If you want to go pee, you have to go to Stinky Farts from now on. Come on, dad... You can't see Stinky Fart whenever you want to. Why do you put mine there? There was nothing else to block it. You didn't know, did you? It's been quite a while she was like this. How can a kid snore so loudly? At least you don't grind your teeth anymore with the mouthguard on. Then I'll sleep in the corner today. DAY 6 it's your turn, Ji-seon. I think it's going to collapse. Couldn't you just let your daughter win? I'm just playing the game. Why are you always so critical to me? I lost again. I must be realIy stupid. Sorry, I didn't get your brain, dad. Ji-seon, children tend to get their mother's brain. What the hell? I am just kidding. This is not exactly the righ moment to joke around. It isn't? We should at least have a sense of humor here. You always say that whenever your daughter isn't good at something. Sure. It's all my fault that I don't get good grades. It's not your fault. Alright, alright... The mother and daughter give me a hard time even down here. I lost interest in this game now. I'm going to bed. Me, too. Honey, you clean up. So loud. Take it easy. That won't make the radio work. DAY 7 Come on, dad. Try a bit harder. Earlier I was criticized for playing too vigorously, wasn't I? That's was then... Until when are we going to play this? Ji-seon, try to come up with some different game. See? Way to go, Ji-seon. I'll try too. That scared me. You get more scared than us. I thought it was another nuclear bomb. DAY 8 What is it, Ji-seon? Something wrong? No. I'd turned on the phone last night to play some games just for a moment... but the battery ran out. Ji-seon. Why did you have to play games here? It's not a normal situation, is it? I'm sorry. I just couldn't fall asleep last night... Let it go. Nothing can be done about it.. We still have yours. Ji-seon, it's been already a week. We're gone through half now. You have to listen to your father and mother until we go out. Okay? What are you doing? When I went to elementary... We had to scrape out the gum sticky on the floor during cleaning time after school. Dad. Why all of a sudden "when I was young" stuff? Ji-seon wouldn't understand such old stories. It's because you hold on to those "when I was young" stories. That you can't connect with Ji-seon. You're like that to your subordinates at work, too, aren't you? You'll be outcast if you do that nowadays. Get me a pot. What's the pot for? The paraffin in the candle becomes liquid once heated. Then we'll be able to reuse it. If i do this, finished! Apparently it was put here. This clock looks familiar... It was from your friend, Sangmin. I told you not to hang out with Sangmin. How can he bring such thing to a housewarming party? Is he in his right mind? It passed away. What? Mr. Owl. The battery's out. The old man's dead. Well, too bad. We don't have any batteries... - It's right there. - Where? Hello, sir. Look forward to seeing you working. It works. Sangmin's clock gift is usefull in the end. We've got to set the time, don't we? But how? Your brain seems to just stop working sometimes. It's 5:38 in the evening. Okay. I can't fall asleep. Why not? All I can hear is the clock. It's too bizarre. What is? Aren't you scared? Of what? Look at its eyes. Ah. I'll flip it. Sangmin, you son of a bitch. Why? Are you okay? I'm fine, fine. I have a bad lung, you know. I think it's because of the murky air in here. Anyway... Mom and dad should be okay, right? It seems mom's phone is out of battery. Ha-yeon? - Hello? - Are you this? Dad? Dad! Can you hear me? Ha-yeon! - What...? I still can't hear you. How are you both? - Your mom... - How's Mom? Your mom is not well. - Is she severely ill? - She has a fever and keeps coughing... Hang in there, okay? We will pick you up soon. You guys take care of yourselves, too . Turn your phone off, it will run out. Dad... take good care of mom. Okay. Let's talk again tomorrow at 12. What? Tomorrow at 12 o'clock? Okay. Let's talk again. Then, I'll call you. DAY 9 You're good. That reminds me of when you went to kindergarten. You asked me to buy you coloring book from the one-dollar shop. And you would draw and stuff there. Did I? I don't remember. Mom. Why do you make that face? No, nothing... Ji-seon, let's try it with me. I'll try drawing something too. Yes. - Are you calling grandma? - Yes. Stay quiet. It's not getting through? Don't worry too much. They will be fine. It would be strange if the phones worked normally in the middle of a nuclear attack. That's such an irresponsible thing to say. You don't even know how they are and you say they'll be alright. What I meant was... You're always like that Without even knowing what's going on... Lunch time. Let's eat. Today's menu is rice with tuna topping. DAY 10 What now? Helicopters. it's so frustrating. I wish we knew what it meant. I think... Could it be an ambulance helicopter? Emergency doctor? The radio! The radio! That won't make the radio work. Gone... It is gone, right? I am thirsty. Where's the water? Honey. Yes. My back itches. Will you see if there's a bug? Hold on. It wasn't a bug, right? I'm going to lose it if it was. It wasn't - No! - Ji-seon! Oh, my God! Oh no! Damn it! I'm sorry. I shouldn't have drank the water... It's okay, Ji-seon. We've got three days with this water. Ji-seon. Let's drink just this much today. DAY 11 Great job, Dongbaek. I scored, didn't I, Ji-seon? That's lit. You've totally changed the underground arena. My dad's the best. Go electronic engineering master. Did you just make fun of me? It take exactly 3 hours and 30 minutes to fill a cup. Do you want to try it first? No. You go first. Wouldn't it be contaminated with radiation? It's probably fine. The dew gathered here is moisture that penetrated the ceiling. So the ceiling probable acted as a filter. That's some kind of osmosis, too? Correct. Right on. Just drink it, dad. Um. Not bad... Here. I'm not thirsty yet. Wash your face with this. Wash my face? Yes. I used to take showers with this much water when I was in the army. You and your bluff... - How's my face? - Wow, it's really clean now. DAY 13 "D-DAY" We have just one more day until we go out, right? Yes, let's endure it for another day. Everyone did a good job. What's the matter, Ji-seon? Do you have a stomachache? Yes, a bit... Dad! - What? - I think it's because of the water you gave me yesterday... No, it's not... See what you've... Ji-seon, are you okay? Yes... I'm fine... Dad, don't listen. Okay, I'll turn on the radio. The North Korean People's Army attacked the main facilities of the South Korean puppet government with pinpoint accuracy. And South Korea's puppet army was completely wiped out. Currently, the entire ​​South Korea metropolitan area is under the military control of the North Korean People's Army and the South Korea people should try to return to their daily lives as soon as possible without any agitation. North Korea and the North Korean People's Army Military, Government will spare no effort in supporting the South Korean people so that they can return to their daily lives safely... The UN Security Council submitted a resolution condemning North Korea's nuclear attack. The international community condemned the North Korean nuclear attack as an intolerable that should be annihilated from human history. The South Korean-US Combined Forces Command immediately launched a counterattack and... North Korean Government Statement. The Central Committee of the Workers' Party of North Korea held a meeting of the Political Bureau today and... Fellow citizens, currently, radiation level has dropped significantly. According to most experts, you may go outdoor as long as you are not approaching the location of the nuclear explosion. However, it is also true that there is still a possibility that a small amount of radiation remains present in the atmosphere. Therefore... What's going on? The North Korean army occupied South Korea? Or has it returned to normality? Which is right? What should we do? I'm... not sure... If you don't, who among us would? What are we going to do tomorrow? Dad. We're going out tomorrow, aren't we? We're not staying here, are we? Of course we're going out. Dad! Even if you don't, I will definitely be out tomorrow. We should... I thought about it... What if... we... don't go out? What do you mean? I'm suggesting we endure a bit longer until the situation is certain... No! Fuck! I don't know what the situation is like either... But what if we go out and get taken by the North Korean army? Whatever. I'm going out tomorrow for sure. What do you think, Ha-yeon? Of course we should go out. What is there to think about? Didn't you listen to the radio? We have no idea what is happening up there. Then you stay here. Ji-seon and I are going out. Come on! We can just go out of here and stay home. I can't stand another minute here! Alright... Then...let's try going up and see the outside situation... At home! DAY-D We're going to be fine, right? For fuck's sake. It's all the same if we're going to die anyway... We'll leave it up to fate. Everyone, follow me... Wait. Why? Let's take a selfie before leaving. - What? - It's something to commemorate. Let's take a photo so that I can upload it to Instagram. - Oh man! - Mom. Yours phone. One, two, three. Now, let's go. What the hell? Dad, hurry up, let's go. Wait! Wait. Not yet! Why? Ji-seon, listen to your father. Damn it. Listen to me! Go down! Is everyone okay? Fuck Are you kidding me? Are you alright, Ha-yeon? I'm fine... Take care of Jason... Ji-seon... try calling Grandma. All right, ma'am. Ma'am! Grandma and Grandpa's cell phones are not active. Oh, no... Now what do we do? Dad. Say something... We have to stay here longer? So suffocating! Say something, anything! I don't know the situation outside... But it's obvious something has exploded... That means... we can't go out now... Then how much longer do we have to stay here? Another 2 weeks? You're not telling me to stay here some, are you? I can't. Then what? Are you going to go out now? It may be full of radiation. If we want to survive... We must stay for another 2 weeks again. Can you think of any other way? Whatever! You stay here. I 'm leaving! Now. Open it, now! Now. Open it, now! Ji-seon, enough! Open, now! Ji-seon! Fucking open it...now.. Everyone just stop. Stop crying! Why are you losing your temper at her? You're right. It's not Ji-seon's fault. But yours. Now what's that supposed to mean? You said we'd stay for another 2 weeks. Now what? You've been playing the smarty pants. So tell us now. What do we have to do? How would I know? What do you mean? You must be responsible. This is my fault? You're the mother! So you have some responsibility, too. Do you really have to blame me in this situation? You were blaming me first. I've been taking care of you, haven't If it wasn't for me. You and Ji-seon would have been long dead! What? Long dead? You son of a bitch! Getting credits is what matters to you now? I'm so sick of it! I mean, you were lashing out at me. And it's all true, isn't it? If I hadn't done what I did... Would we have any water left? Sure, Mr. Know-it-all. If you're so great, tell us what we have to do now. We'll do what your mighty majesty says! So tell us! Fuck, I don't know! How can you say that you don't know? Then we all die here? DAY 14+ 1 Let's eat in small portions. I don't feel so well. I'll skip eating today. Are you going to be fine...? I'm fine... I really don't feel well. You take a bite first... Ji-seon. You have some, too. I don't want to... Have some. - You have to eat to get energy. - I said I don't want to. What's the matter, Ji-seon? Do you not feel well? No, I feel itchy. - Itchy? - Yes. - Where does it itchy? - My back. Let me have a look. I think it's an outbreak of rashes. It looks like atopic skin disease. It must be because of the murky air and mold here. I can't sleep because of itching. Let's try and endure it. We have steroid ointment at home. So I'll apply some as soon as we go out. And when is that? When do we go out? Soon, Ji--seon. Soon. Let's bear with it. How am I supposed to bear with it? If you keep scratching yourself, you'll get infected. Let's bear with it. Fuck. How do you expect me to endure it? Hey Choi Ji-seon! Stop cussing. What do you want me to do? You're not the only one who's frustrated! Fuck, I hate this. I hate this! DAY 14+4 Honey! - What? Spider! Spider! It is... It's not a spider. Give the flashlight. - I said it isn't. - Just give me! DAY 14+5 You'll get a scab. Ji-seon, you have to eat some. Don't want to... You'll get sick on an empty stomach. DAY 14+6 Mom, are you okay? I'm fine...fine... I have a bad lung capacity, you know. So hot... Hot... Mom? Mom! Mother... Mother... Her body is burning up with fever Ha-yeon! Ha-yeon! Ha-yeon! Ha-yeon! Are you okay? Are you in pain? I... too cold... Honey... Yes... What if mom is... die... - then what... - Mom. Don't scare me... Nonsense... Stop saying stupid things... I am too afraid... It just because we've were here for too long. The air is bad, and there must be germs in here, causing your body to ache. You'll be fine soon. I'm...I'm sure... Yes... it just a body ache... Just hang on a few more days. DAY 14+7 DAY 14+8 It's still hot... Ji-seon. We have to cool your mom's body down for the fever to drop. So what? Give me a hand. - How? - Take the top off of her. The top? - Yes. - Okay. DAY 14+9 Dad. Yes... Mom's not going die, is she? Of course not... I mean... in disaster movies... one of the people whom the main characters loves the most always ends up dying. We are in that kind of... Ji-seon. Get yourself together... This is not a movie, is it? True... This is reality... Sure...it's reality... Dad... Dad... DAY 14+10 Honey... Honey... Ha-yeon... Ha-yeon... I'm too cold... Ji-seon! Mom's wokes up. Ji-seon! We have work to do. So get up now. Dad! Are you sure this is the right way? What do you mean? Mom's shivering. Is it really right to be fanning her when she is trembling with cold? Don't you see she has a fever? We must bring the fever down before we do anything else. Dad. Mom's not going to die, right? Don't worry uselessly. People don't die just like that. High fever just means that the body is enduring. Your mom is enduring this well. Don't just come to hasty conclusions as always. We should bring the body temperature down even it may seem harsh now. I can't do this anymore. What...? The flashlight... I think it ran out of battery... "Ha-yeon, your mother passed away today. Let us pray that she goes in peace. And let us survive this and meet again." "DELETE" What is it, Ji-seon? Nothing... Why? What happened? What is there to happen here... Then what's the matter? You're not like my brave, Ji-seon that you always are. Is it because of mom? She is going to be okay. And we'll be able to go out in a few days. Dad... It's okay... It's ok... It's ok, Ji-seon... Mom's going to be fine... And we are all going to be fine... Don't you worry too much... It's all fine... It's all fine, Ji-seon... DAY 14+13 The fever's drop a bit. Really? You're right. Yes. Doesn't she look healthier too? I think she's better! I'm thirsty... Mom! I'm... I'm very thirsty. Hold on. Would you help me up? Is there something there? No... How long has it been anyway? Just one more day to go. We can leave tomorrow. D-DAY Again Ha-yeon. - Can you walk? - Yes. Ji-seon. Are you ready? Yes. Good. After we get out of here... Let's go to grandma and grandpa first. OK. Ji-seon, aren't you taking a selfie this time? No... I don't want to. You don't need to take it? - No, it's fine. - Hand it to me. I'll take it. No, thank you. Will you really be okay? Yes. I can just use the last one. Then... Let's go! END
