- Congratulations! - Thank you! Hey, I can still make babies at this age. I can't even believe it myself. Everyone, drink some more. Congratulations! Hey, Wang, I gave you the invitation, but I didn't think you would really come. We're just passing through. Can't believe you can still make babies. Stop joking. Oh, last month, my wife was in labor, so I couldn't see you. Look at you kid, he has the poor look. Can't help it, we're poor. Come, let's see what your kid looks like. No need. Of course we do, it's his birthday today. White and chubby, he's kind of cute. Thank you! Birthday boy, live as long as you can. I'm just kidding, why be so serious! Did you give him a name yet? His name is Long-life. Long-life? That's tacky. I have another name for him. What? Call him Fart. Fart! Tell me, isn't it a lot better? Ba, there should be a limit to your jokes. Mrs. Ko, don't get angry. Wang, take you and your son our of here. I gave you a gift already. How can you tell me to leave? Fine, if you want me to go, give my gift back. No way! What are you arguing about? Fu, Ba, you two are always so loud together. You're a father already, can't even change. Mee. Stop. I have to greet the guest. I'll greet her for you. You two haven't given up? She has a daughter already, how can I not? Luckily I didn't marry her! Doesn't look like her husband will live long. As long as you know. Fu, Ba, how are you? Hu, you look awful, you should take care. Too bad I didn't take care of myself before. I shouldn't have married her. Sorry. Sir, the priest is here. Invite him in. Yes, sir. What priest? The one that's famous for catching ghosts. Why invite him here? To tell the fortune of my kid. He's here. This way, Master. Priest. Did you prepare the things? Yes, please. Priest, my kid's birth date and time. How's the fortune of my kid, is it good? You want to hear me first or my student? Is there a difference? You go first. OK Congratulations, your son has a good fortune. He'll either be a scholar. Or a general, and he'll live long and healthy. Congratulations, please give a reward. Here you are. Thank you. What? Now it's my turn. First, I'll make one thing clear. That was only his personal opinion. It has nothing to do with me. So how is my son's fortune? Have you given him a name yet? Yes, Long-life. Pretty good name. But it's directly opposite from his fate. What do you mean? He was born on March the third. It's my opinion that he won't live past 23. This child was born on a negative date. Therefore, his positive energy is low. His 23rd year is a hard one for him to cross. He'll be weak when the moon is full. So you should be careful during the full moon. That's garbage. Be quiet, you'll scare the kid. Everyone, look at the moon outside. The moon is full today. What should I do? Set up the table. Yes. The first, moves the earth. The second, gets rid of the ghosts. The third, walks the earth. The fourth, strengthens the soul. The fifth, calls up the saints. All you gods report at once. The kid really stopped crying. As his parents, you should do good deeds. I hope he can make it past 23. After that he'll be fine. Excuse me, maybe I didn't say good things. But you must give me a reward. Give him the reward. Do you need their fortunes told? No, no. Mr. Ko, I need to tell you something else. Your son will mature early. Finally, something good. So, you're saying my son will be dignified. No, I'm saying your son will age quickly. Please. Elite Club! Kill without pardon! Saint Club! Undefeatable! What are you doing? Calm down. Don't move. Let's go in first. Speak. Hsiu. Mrs. Pai, you're extra pretty today. A bag of peanuts. Alright.

No one is allowed to take this. Can I go down now? Stop selling, let's go watch Sing lose. Why did you lose that bad? Sing, you can't lose. How can he not lose. You tricked me. Come on, Sing.

You didn't bump into me. No? No. You bumped into me, not her. You, can't be, you're that strong? Want to try again? No need, I'm leaving. Dad. You can leave now. The name of the Saint Club. Has been destroyed by you bastard. Dad, even if we won. We only get a cheap trophy, so I. So you disgraced us. Buy accepting Mr. Ko's money, right? I'm going to teach you a good lesson. Stop, he's only a kid, it's no big deal. Are you going to kill him? Do I have any dignity left? If you kill him. How are you going to face your dead wife? Fine, leave. I'll punish him for you, so you won't get dirty yourself. Fine, I'll leave him to you, go clean up. Alright. Please have some tea. Mrs. Hu, I know my mistake. I'm disappointed in you. You have the guts to accept this money. It sounds like Mrs. Hu is beating him. They doing it for show. Alright, go let your father take a look. Come back in if it's not enough. Dad. Sing. Did I beat him enough? What, do you want to kill him? Why, you don't have to heart? You didn't have to take me that seriously. Are you OK? Fine. Uncle Ba, I'll go put some medicine on him. Go, hurry. Take care I thought you were joking, why so serious? Who's joking. Luckily I didn't marry her. What a phony. Where did they find him? Don't blame me, blame them. They introduced us. Said they were champs. What phonies, let's go... Let's go. Useless. It's all your fault. Why me? Son, why do you keep them next to you? I'm lonely without them. They're bad influences on you. If you want company why not get married? I like Hsiu, but she doesn't like me. She likes Sing. How can he compare with you? You really like Hsiu? Yes. Come with me. Where to? To propose. Propose. Your drawing is so real. Thanks to my mom. Yeah, I saw your mom. I knew I'd be lucky today. My dad still likes your mom. I've been worried about that. If my mom married your dad. Then we'll be siblings. There goes our future. My dad is afraid to ask your mom. I wish my mom will promise to marry Mr. Ko. Then we won't be siblings. Long-life won't bug me anymore Lee. Hsiu, here's your rice. Put it over there. No, if your mom marries Mr. Ko. Then, Long-life will be your brother. It will be difficult for me to see you. It's better than being related. Hsiu, why don't you go with them? What for? Mr. Ko is proposing to your mom. You will be Miss Ko soon. Propose to my mom? Great, let's go persuade her. Mr. Ko, I cannot accept. Long-lifes' proposal to Hsiu. Mrs. Hu, why not ask Hsiu? Maybe she'll agree. Yeah. Mom, Mr. Ko. Mr. Ko, Mrs. Hu. Hsiu, come. Wow, all these gifts. Forget these things for now I have to discuss something with you. I already know. Everyone has to get married sooner or later. So you... Mrs. Hu, even I know. Even you, then why aren't you nervous? You should be nervous. Right? Right. Me? Hsiu, since you know. What is your opinion? If my mom says yes, then what can I say? Mee, you heard, Hsiu has no objections. Then it's settled. Hsiu, are you sure? Of course. Sing, and you? I agree. Sing, we been friends since kids. You are so kind, thank you. You're welcome. Since Hsiu and Sing both agree, so do I. OK, then it's settled. Mom, congratulations. Why congratulate us? Hsiu, you should congratulate yourself. Sing you should congratulate Long-life. Congratulate myself? Your mom just agreed to our marriage. What? Mrs. Hu, Mr. Ko didn't propose to you? Of course not! They're here to propose to Hsiu. Didn't you get it straight? Mom, we made a mistake, I'm not marrying him. You saw me promise Mr. Ko. You should know me. I never go back on my word. This time you must. No, Mr. Ko I'm accepting the gifts. Let's talk about the other details. Of course. Hsiu, might be awkward at first. But you'll know my good side. Hsiu, no problem. Hsiu... Stop crying. How can I not? I get nervous when you cry. Calm down, let me think, OK? Huffy. Let go find my dad. Will he help? I'll make him help, come. What, Ko at his age. Wants to marry Mee? So we came over as soon as we heard. Uncle Ba, I know you love my Mon. You must stop them. Otherwise you'll lose your chance. Outrageous, I'm going to teach him a lesson. Discuss among yourselves. Mr. Ko, do you think the wedding. Should be Chinese or Western style? Have you decided? God's soldier hurry. As long as everyone is comfortable it's fine. That's right. You know, I'm old. I can't do tough movements. Dad, what are you talking about? Stay out of it Mee, tell me which style you like. I'll do it for you, if it's not tough. Are you crazy? Yes I am. I'm crazy about you, Mee. I want to rip your clothes off, climb on you, and then... Both of you, get lost! Future mother-in-law, please don't be angry. I'll hit him! You dare hit your father? If you don't get lost, I'll hit you! I'll beat up all of you! I'll kill you! Wait for me... Lucky for you you run fast. Don't ever come to my house again Mee. Mother-in-law. Alright, dad. You ruined my future. What did I do? You told Mrs. Hu. You want to rip her clothes off... Why did I say what I was thinking? Mr. Ko, find another woman. I can let you rip off my clothes. Let you climb I can let you... Do what ever. Really? Of course, come... Dad, what are you doing? Mr. Ko, what's the idea of teasing me. Sorry, I'm old and don't want to die in bed. Let's go. You're not the only man in this world. Dad, you really don't want to live? Hsiu. Mr. Ko, did Mee promise to marry you? You bastard. Ba, I didn't think you'd stoop so low. I didn't. Don't deny it. Don't argue with him, we'll get him later. Hsiu, those gifts are for you. Shut up, let's go. Don't be so unhappy. How about we go to the brothel? Can't you think of something else? Let's go practice our penmanship. Penmanship? Then what? Want difference does it make? I want Hsiu to undress in front of me. It's impossible. It's possible. Hurry UP. You got me all sweaty. Do you want to... Hurry I can't wait... Huffy. What a body. It's Mrs. Hu. Better than nothing. She's not bad either. Let's go. Mom, are you done, it's my turn. Soon. Don't look. Why? Hsiu might be my future wife. Haven't you heard of sharing? Not this, let's go. Be careful. Master... Open up! What? Hurry UP. Long-life, you... Hsiu. Hsiu, what's wrong? My child, Hsiu... Mom, can't you see me? I'm over here. Mom... Hsiu, why did you leave me like this? Am I... Mom... Don't be sad. Ko and Long-life. Have they caught those animals yet? What animals? Mr. Ko is a prominent businessman. Plus, without evidence how can I arrest them? I can't even invite them. Mr. Ko. Hello Mr. Ko. Hello. Don't fool around, this is a court. Mr. Ko, please have a seat. Please sit. OK, fine. Quit crying, captain is a good man. He'll get to the bottom of this. Alright, tell me the truth. You first, Mr. Ko. I was just passing by that day. Mrs. Hu mistaken me... Come on. Long-life, you and your friends. Crushed the ceiling and killed Hsiu. Do you still deny it? Sing, calm down, let me. Captain, please... What? Don't listen to my son. Falsely accuse Long-life. Yeah. Are you crazy? Dad, what are you saying? I say this, because I'm not crazy. According to your experience. What is your view? I only have one conclusion. This accident happened, because the Hu residence is too old. So, I find Long-life not guilty, case closed. Captain, you are really sharp. Very precise. Dad, I think you're crazy. But seriously. Mrs. Hu, your house is really old. I'll come and fix it for you. Sing, are you crazy too? Sing take care of Mrs. Hu. Alright, captain, I'm leaving. Good bye! Good bye! Give me back my Hsiu. Let's go home first. Yeah, go fix your house. Don't harass others, it's not right. Mrs. Hu. My Dad was being threatened by the captain. That's why he acted strange. Hsiu died so innocently. Looking at captain and Ko's friendship. You can imagine what he would do. Yes, my dad's right. Hsiu, I can't revenge your death. I'm helpless. You can revenge your death. I want to see Long-life die miserably. So I know you revenged your death. As long as he's alive. Mom won't bury you. She'll stink if you don't bury her. Stink. That's our problem, not yours. Not mine? Yeah, were like a family. Your business is our business. I suggest you bury her. I'm concerned. About what? We live across from you. Our house will stink too. That's your concern. And I really thought. You cared. Mrs. Hu, Hsiu's business is my business. Sen, let's go. Where are you going? Long-life, this is Lieng, your body guard. Lieng? What a strange name? Long time ago, his mom was gang raped, and gave birth to him. So he's called Lieng. This means he's a bastard. You can call me mixed, but not bastard. I forgot to tell you. His Chinese might be better than yours. Why didn't you say so. Can he fight, try him. No need, I tried already. You try it. Me? No need, I'm certain he's good. How would you know if you didn't try? Long-life. I'm here to revenge Hsiu's death. Master, I don't need to try anymore? Lieng, get rid of them Lieng, get rid of them. Pretty good, eh? Very good. You bastard. The bastard can fight. Spit I'm here to find my son not to fight. Fortunately you're here before they're killed. Let's go. Fortunately Ba took them. Any later they would have been carried out. Yeah, fortunately you ran fast. They chased pretty hard. Yeah, I'll piss on them? Yeah. Luckily they ran fast. Miss, why aren't you wearing clothes? You are... We're ghosts I'm the mischief ghost I'm the drowning ghost I'm... You must be a horny ghost. What kind of ghost are you? I don't know. What kind is she? She's a shy ghost. Hello everyone, I'm new. I don't know where to go. We're going the same way. Can I follow you? You'll never get past the gate. Ignore her, lets go. Please don't go. I've never seen such a tough foreigner. It'll be hard to revenge for Hsiu. I told you people to practice. You people are embarrassing. Don't you know. He's the son of foreign troops. Even the Emperor couldn't defeat them. So how do you expect us two to do it? I'll show you next time. Really? Uncle Ba, Sing. Who's calling me? I didn't hear anything. Hsiu. Dad, you saw her, where is she? Right in front of you. Hsiu. Sing. You can't see her. Dad help me see her. No. Why not? Because she's naked. You're looking at her naked? Of course. Master, help me see her too. Do you want to see her naked? Yeah! I'll beat you up! Alright, you go back first. Dad, what about you? I'm going to get Hsiu some clothes. I can only help you this much. Because I'm not your relative. Tomorrow I'll tell your mom to get you more. Thank you. Your mom is really stubborn. She said, if you don't revenge you death. She won't bury you. How do I revenge my death? First, you must report to the gate of death. Where's that? Keep going towards the west. How do you know, have you been there? Stop cursing me. I'm not. But how do you know? When people die, they go west. You're not only a shy ghost. You're also stupid, go. Stop talking, stand still. File number April 10th, 1914. Alright, next. My name is Hsiu Hu, Put some clothes on and come back. Master. Come, drink. No master, I can't. Why not? There's a full moon out tonight. Nothing will happen. We can afford to take the blame. Fine... Check. Waiter. The check. As Long-life lives a day. Mom will not bury you. What are you doing? Sorry. Come over here, there's something flying. Hsiu. Hsiu you head. Really, I saw her. Don't run. Did Hsiu have such a good body? You really saw her? Of course. I took off the silk she was wearing. Can we watch too? Sure. Now what? If I can find her clothes, then I'll know. Really? Sing, you want to give her some money? Didn't you hear, Hsiu doesn't have clothes? Should we give her some money? Of course, and a house too. And also a car. Whatever she needs, I give her. Help me think, what else would she need? I know, but you probably won't do it. Why not, I love her. What wouldn't I give her? You really would? Yes, tell me. What else does she need? A boy friend, see I knew you wouldn't do it. I'm just kidding. She's in the after life. She can probably find a better boy friend. Hsiu find a boy friend in the after life. Then you plan on getting a new girl friend? Do I look like that type of person? A man like me... I'll never marry. What a coincidence. Yeah. Miss, you know each other? Brother, why don't you introduce us? He's my younger brother, Sen. Hello. Your name is... My name is Po. Po. Po, what a cute name. I have to go, bye. Let's go. Sing, have you known her long? Pretty long, she likes me. Really? You don't believe me? Of course, she's back. Po, what's wrong? I forgot to ask you your name? Sing. Sing, Sen, I'm leaving. Bye. You've known each other long? She's cute, I wonder where she lives? Do you like her? You like her too? Why not? I thought you weren't going to marry? I meant a wife, a concubine is different. You rascal! I saw Hsiu last night. Poor girl, didn't even have clothes to wear. I'm going to give her some. Why doesn't she appear in my dreams? I told you, you're too strong. Ghosts are afraid to appear in your dreams. Think about it. Did your ex-husband appear in your dreams? True, but I still don't believe you saw Hsiu. You really don't? Look. What are you doing? Stye. Do you believe I saw Hsiu naked now? My child, Mom didn't know. All your clothes are old. I bought these clothes when I got married. They're still new, you'll like it. Mom will give them to you. With Hsiu's clothes I can conjure her up. Mrs. Hu's gone, let's go. But what if Mrs. Hu notices? Go steal some clothes from Mrs. Pal. Huffy. Hurry... Are you Hsiu? Yeah. Your relatives gave you some clothes, keep it. Take it. Thank you. Can I really see Hsiu? Of course, be quiet. Let go over there. Are you sure? Definitely. It's in your hands. Stepping on the stars. Sun moon star. Help me conjure up the ghost. Not bad, eh? I think it sucks. I have another trick. Round sky, square earth. Come land next to me. Stop embarrassing yourself. Forget it, let's go. Yes, this is it. Is this Hsiu? I think it's Mrs. Hu. Mrs. Hu? Hurry hurry disappear. How can it be Mrs. Hu? I think something is wrong. Yes, I know what's wrong. What? You're what's wrong! That doesn't make sense, strange. Po, let's go back to Tibet tomorrow. Why not stay longer? You know why. The southerners can't accept our religion. Our religion and theirs were once the same. I think you should try to convert them. Stop lecturing me. I think you want to play a few more days. Dad, you really understand me. Mr. Ko, what would you like? The usual. Huffy. Yes, right away. Look master, she's gorgeous. How come I never seen her before? She might be from our of town. Go for her. Yeah. Have some more. Watch out for that old man next to her. We have Lieng with us. Plus you have plenty of money. That's right. Go over. Try to lure the old man away. I got it. What? I have to go to the bathroom first. Can't you hold it? Old man, I want to make the moves on her. Are you crazy? Exactly. Hitting is loving, hit me. Why did you hit me for? You were flirting with me? Kid, there's a ghost on you. Ghost? Where? Take a look. You can see her now. Hsiu. Don't come over... Go away. Help... Stop. Let me go... What are they doing? Help me... Dad, what happened? I think I heard Hsiu crying for help. Where is she? How are you going to do that? Dad, help me. I wonder what he's up to. Dad, what are you doing with the vase? Why did you hit him? Because he's too weak. Sky's heart, united heart, straight through. Sing. Save me... Po, step aside. Dad, someone calling me. Step aside first. Sing, are you OK? Leave... Tough, tough... Thank you for saving me. My master has admired you for a long time. Well... It's all on me. Sing, I can't believe you're here to save me. Why are you like this? I can't understand why my mom gave me these. They're OK, Hsiu I miss you. Me too. He should have saved Hsiu by now. What is he doing? What do you think? Nah? Damn kid. What's wrong? It's day light, I must go. Hsiu. Sing, go now. You too, go. Hsiu. Go, hurry. Why isn't he moving? I think he's exhausted. Shing's young, he should last all night. When I first got married, my husband could. That's why he died so soon. Damn kid, he's still not back. I don't think he wants to. Finally. Dad, Mrs. Hu. Tell me, after you saved Hsiu. Did you... Did we what? Did you make love to her? Please, can you be more tactful? What's more tactful? You should ask, did you and Hsiu mate? Or did you take Hsiu? Sing, did you or didn't you. Really? Mrs Hu, don't get the wrong idea. She wanted to, I didn't force her. MY happiness. Was destroyed by your urges last night. His urges was towards Hsiu. Not you. How did you lose your happiness? You dumb woman, they've mated. That means were in-laws. Which means I can't marry you. Isn't that destroying my happiness? Who told you to act so late. We wouldn't lose our happiness on them. Mrs. Hu, my Dad is too old. He wasn't give you too much happiness. Sing. Dad, if this priest didn't help me last night. I would have been killed by Sing and Hsiu. Mr. Ko, don't start celebrating too early. Your bad luck has not passed yet. I'll really not live past 23. You're only 23? Why do you look like 43? I mature quickly. Priest, can you save my son? He should have died long ago. It's a miracle that he's still alive. Can he overcome the next incident. That depends. Priest, if you can save me. I'll be your son-in-law. Dad, let's go. Miss Po, I'm just joking. You're here to spread your region. If you can save me, I'll donate some money. So you can build a temple, and stay here. And spread your religion. Please save my son. I'll do my best. It might be rough on you Mr. Ko. As long as I can live past this I don't mind. Hsiu still haven't revenged her death. She can't report to the after life. After tonight she won't be able to pass. Then she'll be a lone ghost in the wild. What should we do? We must notify her. So she can be reincarnated. Dad, do the magic stuff. So I can notify her. Don't stay past midnight. I know. Why did knock him out? Didn't you do that last time? Magic alone is enough this time. Sorry. Mr. Ko, don't come out. Don't worry, priest. Some. Soldier. Dual. Person. Both. Pattern. Split. Again. Forward. Is Long-life really safe in there? Don't worry. Only my dad and I know now. No one will harm him. Mr. Ko, one more thing. What? Because you're related to your son. If he dodges his bad luck. It might get on you. Then what should I do? I know. You must... die. In order for your relatives to be safe. I'll make you stop breathing, in case someone comes. And sees the funeral, they won't disrupt us. Won't I die if I stop breathing? No, my dad will use magic to bring you back. It won't take too long. You two. Remind the priest to wake me. Understand? Yes sir. Then it's settled. Go prepare now. Hsiu, my dad told me to find you. You must report to the gate of death. Otherwise you'll be a wild ghost. What time is it? It's almost midnight, hurry. Wait, I learned to fly. Really? We're here, I must go in. I'll see you in the next life. Sing, take care. Hsiu. Name? Lee. File number June 4, 1971. Sing. Hsiu. What? I'm not going back. We can be a ghost couple. What are you doing, go back. Ok, next. Name? Sing Wang- File Number? What file number? Your birth date February 10th, 1915. You're not completely dead yet. Hsiu, why did you get kicked out? They say I'm not completely dead yet. What, you too? Really, Hsiu is not completely dead. Yeah. Then hurry up and catch her spirit. Sen, prepare the stuff? Yes, master. Dad, can Hsiu really come alive? Clear, clear sky. Stepping on the seven stars. Ghosts back off. Open the doors to death. Hurry, hurry. Sing, let the ghost lead the way. Please pay the toll fee. Hsiu come back. Light images. Mrs. Hu, Hsiu's back. Really? You can wake Hsiu up now. Hsiu wake up. You've been sleeping for seven days. Hsiu, can you hear me? Hsiu. Why isn't she moving? Is there something wrong with your magic? There shouldn't be. Sing, go get a hair clip for me. Sorry Hsiu. No Scent. What? Hsiu is back, but she lacks a force. What now? Hsiu tell me how you died? I remember when I was taking bath, I saw Long-life fell down suddenly. Before I pass out, I smelled the bad breath from Long-life. Oh, I see. No wonder Long-life has good complexion these days. What did Hsiu tell you? The reason Hsiu failed to wake up, is because... her main force has been taking by Long-life. What's that mean? People lack a force Buddha lack a incense. The force is the main force. What should we do now, dad? Find Long-life and take back the main force for Hsiu. If we fail to do that before dawn, Hsiu will be doomed. What are you doing here? Come on. Let's go, come on. Uncle Ba. Mr. Ko is dead? Yes he is. You were a friend of our master. So please pray for him. How did he die? Where's Long-life? He's weak because of his sadness. So he's resting in his room. His father died and he's not even here. That's ridiculous! Is he really dead? You saw his corpse. Please leave now. What's the meaning of this? He died too suddenly I think he might have been murdered. So I want to do an autopsy. Look, he died so peacefully. Does he look like he's been murdered? No, that's why I have to do an autopsy. You were a good friend of our master. Why disrupt his funeral. Tell Long-life to get out. I want to ask him what's going on. Stop them! You're the only help. I don't want to hurt you, don't come over. Whoever does the best. The master will give them a reward. So, Ko isn't really dead. Sen, are you alright? Master, I don't think I can beat him. Po! Sing, what are you doing here? Is Long-life in there? I'm helping him get past his bad luck. Young man, we meet again. You're all useless. Dad! Po! Priest, let Long-life out. I need to save someone. Who? My fiance, he stole her breath. I need to get her breath back. Opening the door might be dangerous. I can't wait past midnight. This is God's will. Nonsense. Watch you mouth. Dad. Sing. Stop hitting him, dad, he's hurt. Only if he stops interfering. Bullshit. Out of the sheathe. Thunder lightning. Set, out. It's almost sunrise, what are they doing? Why aren't they back? Sing, don't move. No, I can't wait. Sing... It's useless. Hsiu, I'm sorry, I can't save you. Hsiu. Sing, I'll help you. Go. Alright. Steady. Dad... Take her to save Hsiu. Master. Mrs. Hu brought Hsiu. The time is almost up. You're not in a hurry, but I am. Careful. Long-life, what's wrong with him? He's not dead, save Hsiu. Dad, sorry. That's alright, it's God's will.

Alright, put it down. Sing, what do I call this one? Call her big sister-in-law. Big sister-in-law! It's too complicated. Alright, Sing, go in there for the ceremony. You really want to steal my bride? It's not up to me any more. But, aren't you scared? What for, I'm over 23. Your birthday is next month. Quit scaring me. No way. Wait! Congratulations. Thank you. You are so mean, didn't even leave one for me. I'm handsome, you're mature. Wait until my birthday, next month. Ba is my dad, the priest is my father-in-law. Do you dare touch me? Can magic and religion beat a gun? Is your son sick? His son is sick. Sick, Long-life, what are you doing? What are they doing? I don't know. Sorry, I'm late. Congratulations! The End
