[chattering] Now we're ready. [panting] [woman] Do you have family here? No. You have a place to stay? Where is your family then? - Back in India. - Uh-huh. Don't you worry, my dear. I know what it's like to be in your shoes, starting over. I left everybody behind, just like you. You work hard, you make it here. You believe that? Yes. Is this real? Uh-huh. So some ground rules. No stealing, no drugs, no prostitution. I run an honest establishment. We're all family here. I want to make an honest living. Good. - My passport. - No, this? No, I think I will, uh, keep this in my safe until we get you a new one. An American one. Maybe one day you'll be running this place, huh? There used to be a pool, we had to take it out. That was a shame. Here is the laundry room. You'll be spending a lot of your time in there. Hey, kids, is this your pizza box here? You gotta pick that up. That doesn't look so good, huh? I let them stay here. Their mother's an addict, it's very sad. I got a big heart. [hip hop music plays] [woman hums] This is Riz, she just got here. That's okay. That's okay. Come, come, come. We've got a plaza room down here. Some of the people have services on Sundays. If that interests you, you can do that. Good evening. We have, uh, karaoke on Monday nights. You like singing? Oh, you have to come to karaoke, everybody does. Excuse me just one moment. Sal! [door unlocks] [woman] Who the fuck are you? She said I stay here. God! That pathetic bitch.

Thank you. Hey. Oh. Here. One sec, huh. How much to see you in one of these towels? How much? How much? Hey... Jana. It's me. I made it to America. It's beautiful here. The sky is so blue. You can see the mountains from here, just like home. Friends? Yeah, I have made some friends. There is this girl named Dallas. D-A-L-L-A-S. You know, like that city. I don't know, some Americans have funny names. I'll send money as soon as I save up. [door opens] I need my things first. A deal is a deal. Come to mama. ♪ Four little kitties in a row ♪ [sniffs] - You want some? - No. You've never done it before, have you? Fuck! [panting] Where the fuck is it? [woman] Sal. Sal, what the fuck is going on? My phone is ringing off the hook with complaints about the noise in this room. - I can't fucking find it. - All right, calm down. What's the matter? I bet you're in on it, aren't you? You fucking stole it, didn't you? - You lying bitch! - Sal! You don't talk to me like that. We have an arrangement, 30-70. You think I'm gonna steal it from you? What's going on? - It's gone. - What? The whole brick. Una, I need to get it back. Someone fucking stole it. Who? I don't know who. - Who do you think? - I don't know who. Oh, what the fuck? Piece of shit. Maybe it was one of the cleaning girls. Which one? The blonde one. Dallas? Yeah? - Yeah. - Maybe. Crackhead. Okay. So you go find her, you figure it out. But you keep it down. We don't want the police here again, hmm? Take it. I don't want it. Yeah, well, sometimes you gotta be bad in order to be good. Don't you think? [Dallas] How do you say sister-fucker? - Behnchod. - Banchode. - Behnchod. - Banchode. - Yeah, something like that. - That's sister-fucker? Yes, sister-fucker. What are you having? A vanilla milkshake. A vanilla milkshake? Are you, like, twelve or something? Wanna hear my list of nail-salon ideas? We got Nail Me Right, Divalicious Diva Nails, Diva Dallas, Diva Dolly. But I'm not. Actually, we should do your nails tonight. Like, shape 'em up real nice, maybe do something like mine? What can I get you? Doreen. - It's a lovely name, Doreen. - What can I get you? Um, we would like two vanilla milkshakes, please. I was serious about that nail salon, though, you know? - I'm gonna do it. - Here? In this dump? Fuck, no. I'm getting the hell out. Una can fuck off. - Why don't you just leave? - Are you serious? Do you think I would last a day out there without money? I got a whole strategy up here, you know? She probably pays for sex, you know? Like, who would wanna fuck her? Listen, maybe you can help me. I saw what you did, stealing. Opening suitcases, God knows what else. You're sneaky, Riz. Look, Jimmy and I, we got a plan. Okay, we score extra dough on the side. - Odd jobs, simple, easy stuff. - Like drugs? We're gonna hold up that bitch Una. I'm not doing anything criminal. Are you calling me a criminal? I need to use the washroom. Doreen! Thank you. Try the cream on top. Try the top. - Yeah. - Try the top, yeah. It's my favorite bit. It's nice. Fuck, yeah. I'm vomiting and I'm like, yakking up these mushrooms. But then in the vomit I could see maggots. So I'm like, "Do I vomit, do I not?" It was pretty scary.

Don't you worry your pretty little head about it. That's gotta be fucking... What are you gonna get me for it? I mean, college kids will pay, like, 800 for that shit. 1.5K or I sell it here. If you try and sell it here whoever you stole it from is gonna find out. Get real grumpy about it. 1K. All right, we have a deal but you gotta do this extra thing for me first in the school. - Is it gonna make me money? - Mm-hmm. You know what that makes me for Halloween? Hot and horny?

Get the fuck off of her! Up. Well, you saved me from the big rabbit. Drink. Drink. How did you get those scars? Did you do that to yourself? It started with robbing tourists. Then, car parts. Then cash machines. We were a gang of six. All different. Like, in a family. And what'd you do with the money? Paid the smugglers to bring me here. It was the only way. - And trucks. - Trucks? I was in charge of getting the trucks to stop so that we could rob them. I... I hopped in to this old man's truck. And... we drove for a bit. Then, he suddenly stopped in the middle of nowhere. And he jumped on me. I took care of it. How? [sighs] Lie on me. Okay. Closer. Kiss my neck. Then he pulled down his pants. [both laugh] [Trump] A new vision will govern our land.

I'm ready for some R&R, Jimmy. Ruthless revenge. That bitch is not gonna know what hit her. Are those mine? [indistinct chatter] - [Jimmy] What? - [Dallas] Stop it.

Hey, Dallas, you in or not? I don't know, Jimmy. It all seems a bit sketchy for me. Listen, I'm going out on a limb here for you robbing my own flesh and blood. What are you doing for me? Jeez. All right. Hey. Thank you. Dallas! - What? - What's that? - It's Doreen. - Doreen? Yeah, Doreen. Jimmy gave her to me. I hate rats. You don't really like Jimmy at all, do you? I don't know him.

You're calling me a whore? Look, he know... Look, he knew that I sold his stash to Jimmy. Hey... I need this. Wake up. Come. You should go to your room. Go. Morning, ladies. Looking good. [truck horn honks] Get that other one. You know, my mama was in a traveling country band? Not, like, anything fancy. She lived paycheck to paycheck and whored it up with any and every club owner that she could find. As luck would have it, she was eight months pregnant in Dallas when I decided to come early. She couldn't really... Hey, well, grab me that. She couldn't think of a name. She thought... "We're in Dallas, so why not call her Dallas?" That's how I got my name. I like the name Dallas. How'd you get your name? From my grandmother. Wow! You look like shit. Where the fuck have you been? I've been calling you all night. - Went out for a walk. - That's romantic. Listen, we have to do this tonight. Do what? None of your business, munchkin. School. Midnight. Be there. I don't think I'm up for it tonight, Jimmy. Are you kidding me? - It's gonna be so easy. - Don't. I've been planning this shit for the past three months. Now you just decide you're not feeling it? Pink's expecting it. I'm not Pink's bitch, you are. What happened to that crank, anyways? I'm selling it. You know what? Maybe I won't. If tonight's off, all deals are off. Jimmy boy is flying solo. Jimmy! Jimmy, wait, please. I'm sorry, baby. I... It's just been a rough night, okay? I'm sorry. I'll be there. It's all right. You know how I get sometimes. Do you think he knows? He's a decent fuck but he is not the brightest of bulbs. He wants to do the robbery tonight. Which robbery? The one at the school. - No, please, Riz. - No. - Riz, we need your help. - No. No. Riz, we need to get out of here. Do you know how many pills we will find in that school? Look, I promise, I will take you to Niagara Falls myself after. Please. [Una] Don't you think the lights are pretty? This is my favorite song. - Yes, I know. - Did you know that? - Yes, I know. - Okay! It's a good song. You know that Fleetwood Mac? They're great. Oh, fuck. What the fuck is she doing here? We need three to pull this off, okay? Fine, you can come, just don't be no stool pigeon, okay? What the fuck is this fucking estrogena? Oh, Una's menopause pills. Just throw them on the floor. - Have you got the keys? - The key to success. [Jimmy laughs evilly] I wanna be with you. [laughing] Wait, you look scared! - Don't be scared! - Well, why not? - It's fun! It's the song! - Si, si, si. [engine shuts off] There's a camera at the entrance. Yeah, I know. It's been broke for months. You sure? Yeah, I'm sure. Just don't get in the way. What? "I wanna be a pilot when I grow up." - What is it? - Put that shit down. Jimmy boy? Damn it. - What's wrong? - It should be this one. Well, did you bring the right key? What? He didn't bring the right fuckin' key. - Okay, let me try. - Give me a sec, okay, Dallas? All right, fine with me. - I don't know. - Mm-hmm. [door slams] What the fuck was that? Let me try. - Let me try. - What? No. [Dallas] Fucking let her try, Jimmy.

He's gonna get you a pink passport. Where the fuck you learn to do that? These fingers are muy talented. - [music plays] - [Jimmy strums guitar] Dance with me. [music continues] [laughs] Wild night? We have to talk, Jimmy. I found it. Found what? In the basement. You went through my... You went through my fucking stuff again? Why do you do this? - What are you trying to prove? - What am I... What are you trying to prove? I don't wanna run this fucking-piece-of-shit motel! I've got my own business with Pink. Jimmy, grow up! Jeez! This isn't some dime bag of stolen pills. This could get you in real trouble. You want to get your ass fucked in jail? You've gotta clean up. Like a good boy and come help me out here. You liked those classes at the community college. You could go back. Who's gonna buy your fucking Vicodin if I'm in community college, hmm? Fuck you, Una. It's mom to you. And I don't work this hard to watch you waste yourself. - Just give me that! - No! I am keeping this hostage until you get your act together! Fuck! Fuck! Where are the drugs? Jimmy just probably took 'em to sell them or something. Don't stress. I trust him, okay? He's one of us. [buzzes] [phone buzzes] Let's try it again. What are your names? And what are you doing here? It's $40 for an hour 120 for the night, paid in advance. For the night. Supposed to be meeting a friend of mine who's staying here. - Your name? - Oh. Floyd. Floyd Lutz. Who's your friend? His name is Sal. Lutz is L-U-T-Z. Yes, ma'am. Mm-hmm. Is he here? I don't want any trouble. Riz? Will you take Mr. Lutz to Sal's room? Riz! [Dallas] I don't give a shit. Chilly day, ain't it? You sure this is his room? It is clean as a whistle. I guess he must have left. Well- Now that is a comfortable mattress, eh? If I had a mattress this comfortable, I'd sleep all day. So. Where is he? I'll get you another bulb. Hey, do you wanna feed Doreen? Why are you always feeding her? She's going to die from choking or get fat and have a heart attack. What got into you today? Someone came in looking for Sal. What? Creepy as hell. Okay, maybe he's just, you know just here for the night, and he's gonna leave tomorrow. It doesn't feel right. We just need to stay calm. Just stay calm. We? It's all your fault, Dallas. Okay, how is this my fault? You're the one who killed him. I saved your ass! - You were the one in his room. - Shh. You stole from me, that's why I stole from him. I need to get him a bulb. Jesus, fuck! Who the fuck are you? Blood red. How the hell did... Get the fuck out! You like the color? Yeah, of course, I fucking do. It's my fucking nail polish. Get the fuck out of here before I call somebody. Easy. - Get out! - Okay. Shh, it's okay. - Get out! - Look at that. - Look at this color. - Get out! Don't fuck with me. Now. Do you even know what's in nail polish? Dibutyl phthalate, toluene and formaldehyde. Now, you look like you know something about drugs. Why don't you tell me everything you know and I won't make you drink that nail polish? [gagging] What are you doing? Jimmy and I were really in love. We were gonna run away. Just the two of us. Then Una found out and... We were gonna call her Austin. Austin? You know, not even, I wasn't even fucking born in Texas. I was born in Michigan. What sort of a name is Detroit? Right? - Let's just... - Don't tell me... - What's your problem? What? - You can't tell me to go. Don't! What's my problem?
