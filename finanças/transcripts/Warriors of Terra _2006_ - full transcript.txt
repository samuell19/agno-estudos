[suspenseful music] [computer beeping] [video static] [Ali] Chapel Pritchard was supposed to be the big score. [eerie noises] Privately owned and funded biological research giant with more government contracts than... ...well anyway. They've been the subject of protests and scrutiny for years. But, no one had ever been able to prove a thing and no one had ever been able to get inside. So the line was drawn. After a dozen success stories we were almost on auto-pilot. Twelve's not a bad score for a bunch of university students. And we figured this would be the easiest run yet. This time... we had an inside guy. [funky music] [door opens] [Jade] 'Bout time. [Fix] I wasn't gone that long, Boss. Nice van. Ali... This is Jade. And that's Tim. Jade. Tim. And uh, this is the innocent Izabella. Izzy. -Hiya! -Hey. Does she have it? I got it. I think she has it. Well then, grab it and let's move. I'm going where it goes. That isn't the deal. Well, it is now. We don't do tourists. Yeah, well if you want in then I'm coming along. Just give us the fucking card and go home. Jade! What's the big-- What? You got a butterfly tat and some piercings and suddenly you count? Right. Have fun staring at the front door. [Fix sniggers] Um... What could it hurt, Boss? Yeah, it might be useful to have another pair of um... -Eyes. Eyes. -Eyes, around... for looking. All good to me. [Tim] Seriously, Jade, she might be able to help out. -Please? -Pretty please? [Tim] I need this. [Fix, Tim and Izzy laugh] This is bullshit. [Ali] I... don't think anybody else seems to mind. Don't fucking push me. Alright... Fuck it. Fine. But you do exactly what I say. Here... you can wear mine. I don't really go out anymore anyways. [Jade] Come on, Clueless. You're already holding us up. [door slams] Here we go! [upbeat, funky music] [Tim] No! That's big! That's a big building. [Tim laughs] You could fit a whole lot of science into that building. We'll get in. Yo, Izzy. What do you think of this shot? Every frame, a Rembrandt. [sinister music] [computer beeping] [intense, suspenseful music] Hey! -Wayne. -[Wayne] Yo. Dude, I gotta show you something. [Wayne] What? [keyboard typing] There it is. -Is that a midget? -[laughing] Yeah, dude! He gets his whole leg up there, man. Ooh, that is fuckin' filthy. [Chris laughs] [switch clicks] [intense, dramatic music] [gate squeaks open] [Tim] Cool. Yeah, I guess so. Yo, this is the Holy Road, hon, so there is no need to worry. What? It's like Caine... from Kung Fu. Okay, look. If you get in any shit just look for the wascally wabbit. [suspenseful tones] [Wayne] Oh, you filthy pig. -[Chris] Hey, Wayne. -[Wayne] Mm. -I'm gonna go do the rounds. -Yeah, yeah. Double, double. Oh. [computer beeping] Chris's got the hook up. We're solid. [intense, dramatic music] [suspenseful music] -We're out in the open here. -Be patient. Chris will be here, okay! [Fix] Yeah, we're not attracting attention to ourselves. There's no fucking way I'm standing around waiting for your prom date. So aren't I. [keypad beeps] [doors open] [warning beeping] Oh, you dirty girl. [alarm beeping] [suspenseful tones] [intense, dramatic music] -[Jade] We're in, Iz. -Copy that, Boss. Already got the cameras looped. -[Chris] Boo! [laughs] -[Fix] Jesus! -My fucking heart! - Ah, karma's a bitch isn't it! Fucking assholes! Hey! One step further and you're fucked! -Hi, baby! -Hey, cutie. I was starting to wonder if you ditched us! Hey... Not in your wildest dreams. So, why'd you set us up to babysit, huh? She holds the card, she makes the call, right? Wait a minute. -You didn't get in here usin-- -Swipe card? Yeah! Queen Bee's idea. [Jade] The fuck did I say about pushing. What the fuck did I tell you about waiting for me. -Hmm! -Hmm. Save it. [radio static] [Wayne] Yo, Chris! Jesus Christ. [sighs] Yeah, Wayne. [alarm beeping] Ah... the system says that Doc Woods just walked in. [Wayne] What d'ya think he's doing here now? I don't know! Maybe hiding the bodies. What's that? [sighs] Look... Wayne I'm doing the rounds right now, man. And I'm telling you I'm at the front door and there's nobody here. [alarm beeping] [Chris]It must be a malfunction so just do whatever you're doing, okay? Yeah, copy that. [phone dial tone] [phone ringing] [phone ringing] What is it? Who and what time? What do you mean you can't see him on the screen? No. Follow protocol. Call the team, wait for me. [funky music] [spray can spraying] [Tim] Yo, Yo. What d'ya think of blondie, bro? Fuck you, you tubby bitch. I think she likes them smaller. Yo, I'm cutting carbs, man. Getting svelte. -Way older. -Well, I'll get older. In time. [spray paint spraying] Your dad's gonna be pissed. [scoffs] I'm sure he will be. If he ever fucking notices. Hey, come on. How's it feeling, kids? Yeah, there's a lot of love, Iz. Pace yourself. [phone ringing] Good evening, Doctor Woods. Am I catching you at a bad time? [computer beeping] Okay... [ominous tones] Well, that's different. [footsteps] Well, this is different. Are we in right place? This is as far as my access takes us. Front and center, Clueless. You're on. I love when their little tails start wagging. [electronic beep] [door opening] [brakes squealing] [inaudible] till we figure this out, gentlemen. [ominous tones] [Tim] Blue ball city. [Jade] Where are the animals, Chris? -Where are the fucking animals? -They gotta be here somewhere! -[Ali] Chris! -Just, I've gotta think, okay? [Fix] These cages are totally clean. They've never even seen a rat's crack. [Tim] Yeah, my frigging mum doesn't tidy this nice. [sinister tones] We've been played. You guys wanna check out the elevator? [Izzy] Where are the animals? [computer beeps] [Izzy] Ah, guys? We got a problem you got company. [dramatic tones] -We're done here. -No, no, no, hey! They gotta be behind here somewhere! [Jade] No! We go now. Yeah, Jade. [electronic beep] Very direct action. Just like the website. Daddy give you the code, Princess? [Jade] No? [Jade] Then shut the fuck up and do what you're told-- Shut up! Listen. Look, there's only a front door. So, if the security is on their way... If we go back... There's a shit storm. -Back door then. -There is no back door. Well, what do you mean no back door? There's only one way in or out. [sinister tones] We're so fucked. [surveillance video buzzing] [Turner] Clear. Keep moving. [ominous tones] You guys gotta book. Izzy... find us another way out of here... fast! [Izzy] This place is tight. [computer beeping] [Izzy] The only thing that goes anywhere is that elevator. Then get us into it! I can't, there's too many fucking door codes. [Turner] Clear. [computer beeping] Come on, come on, come on! [Turner] Easy... easy. [sinister tones] [dramatic tones] Oh... come on, Iz! [computer beeping] [keyboard typing] [suspenseful tones] Did she get it? Izzy... I need the code... [computer beeping] [Izzy sighs] Oh! -Izzy! -Tell her to open everything. -What! -Open everything! Yeah, I think you're right. [computer beeping] [confirmation beeps] [warning beeping] [confirmation beep] [door opening] [doors unlocking and opening] [sinister tones] [electronic static and beeping] [dramatic, sinister tone] [Turner] Smoke bomb, gentlemen. Hudak, you're on point. Clever little shits aren't they? [footsteps] [Turner] Watch your step. [Turner] We've got them cornered. [elevator opening] [footsteps] [Turner] On my mark. [Tim yells] Come on, come on! [sirens blaring] [Turner] Now! [electric shots sparking] [Jade] Oh, holy shit! [Ali frantically] Oh, Chris! [Chris choking] [Ali] Oh my God! It's gonna be alright, baby. [Chris gasping and choking] [failure beeps] [Izzy] I can't access any other levels. The encryption is too good. [Izzy] You guys are going down. Down? No, no, no! We don't wanna go down! We wanna go out! O-U... fucking T, out! Come on, Iz get us outa here and I'll take you for those umbrella drinks you like. [Izzy] Give me a sec I'm look-- -[Jade] Come again? [Izzy] I said I'm look... for the... bl... prints-- Izzy?[radio static] Guys?[radio static] [computer beeping] Oh... shit! [elevator clanging] Izzy? [Peter] Response Team this is Isaacs. -Turner here. -Status? We're holding for the elevator. God dammit! Will you get them under control? [Turner] Copy that. We should have them momentarily. One fucking elevator. [computer beeping] Wow! Why don't you take the rest of the night off. [elevator door opening] [Ali and Jade shallow breathing] [Tim] Very creepy. Ground floor... Ladies wear... sporting goods... [Tim] And other fucked up shit. [gate screeching open] [Ali grunts] [sinister tones] [Fix] Well... on the other hand bowling would've been fun. [gate rattling] Oh shit! [sinister tones] So? Now what? I can make one simple phone call... And face the consequences. Don't you dare! Look at Chris! Really, Jade! What do you want? Do you want one of us to get hurt? [Ali] Do you want one of us to die? [Ali] Look... [phone dial tone] I'll call my dad and he'll get us out of here. I'll just say it was all my idea. [Jade] Fucking kidding me right? Jesus, Jade! -Fuck you! -Come try. Look, do you think this is gonna help. -There's no signal anyway. -It doesn't matter. Maybe you should start worrying about your team, Jade. As far as I can tell... You're the only one crying like a little bitch. [Tim] Can we not? Please! [computer beeping] [footsteps] Peter... You shouldn't be here. [Dr. Woods] Peter... you have to tell the team-- The team will secure the complex. -I don't see how one girl-- -Doors are open. She's downstairs already. [Dr. Woods] What? [Dr. Woods] I don't understand. How could she even get the code? I... I think you might be missing my point. -What do you mean? -She's opened all the doors. [sinister tones] The system was purged. [keyboard typing] [computer beeping] [computer beeping] [suspenseful tones] [electronics restarting] -[Jade] What the... -[Fix] It's Izzy! -She's still with us. -[Tim] Awesome! [Tim] What the hell is she trying to say? I have no clue! [suspenseful tones] Move! Move, move, move! [elevator opening] Shit! [suspenseful tones] [gunshots] [bullets ricocheting] -[Fix] Fuck! -[Turner] Cease fire! [gunshots] [Turner] Cease fire! [Tim] Fix! [gunshots] -Oh fuck! -Why are they shooting? What the fuck do you think you're doing'? Punk threw something' sir. Yeah... spray paint scares the shit outa me too! [Turner] No one shoots unless I say so! [Turner] Is that clear? Yes, sir. Turner, report. [Turner] We've got one of them Mr. Isaacs. Looks like it might have been an inside job. [Peter] We have a situation the plans are changing. [Turner] Sir? There's a... [sighs] experiment down there. [Peter] I need you to check to see if it's gotten loose. An experiment, sir? It is vital that this experiment remain caged. Check your facility map for the containment room. [ominous tones] -Copy that and if it's escaped? -Then kill it. [Dr. Woods] Peter she's-- [Peter clicks] [Turner] We've got our orders. You two, you've got the containment room. Yaguchi... you're on me. And me, Boss? You get to babysit and secure the elevator. -Man why-- -Secure the elevator! We should have put an end to this a long time ago. [Dr. Woods] Peter... We did this. We are obligated to try and undo it. We are obligated to the shareholders. This experiment has provided no new data for far too long. -This experiment is a person. -Please, spare me. I've read your journals. You have no real idea what she is, what she's capable of... Have you forgotten the last time? Ten years you've tried to cure her. Tell me... Has anything you've put into her from the beginning, done much more than piss her off? -We were close. We almost-- -Sydney... That's your daughter down there, Sydney. [Dr. Woods] Okay, but you have to tell them about the light. -You think they'll believe me? -They aren't equipped to deal with Mia. Well, for Alison's sake you better hope they figure it out. -Peter! -I will not put us in the same jeopardy twice. If they cannot contain Mia... You know what I have to do. No. No, Peter. I won't let you do it. Sydney! [dramatic, sinister tones] -You wouldn't... -I would. And you know it. [surveillance video buzzing] [electronic static] Okay, yo what are we gonna do about Fix? [shallow breathing] Izzy will get him. The same as us. The further we go, the harder it's gonna be to get back. [metal clattering] Just keep it moving. Come on. [computer beeping] Where'd the hell you disappear to, Fix? [Fix muttering angrily] Chapel Pritchard... great! You know, wait. Hook up with the inside guy... rescue animals and we're fucking there. Get lost a mile underground. Uh, let's see... You know, maybe I could get my ass shot at! [Fix scoffs] [shivering] Fuck me, where do I sign up? Fuck. [footsteps] [footsteps getting louder] [soft, sinister tones] [surveillance video buzzing] [Ali] She wants us up there. [Jade] You don't say. We should've brought like... some sandwiches or pudding or something. [Jade] Not funny, Tim. Not trying' to be funny I'm hungry. [electricity flickering] [sinister tones] [suspenseful tones] [footsteps] [Piper] Miss? [ominous tones crescendo] Can you hear me? [Piper yells] Hudak! [sinister, piercing crescendo] [harsh, sucking sound] [soft, sinister tones] [Tm] No lights. [Jade] We should double back to the elevator. [Ali] Maybe, Izzy wants us to stay put. [surveillance video beeping] Sit tight and let them pass you by. [Tim] This is some mad Dr. Frankenstein shit. Shh... You shush. [soft, sinister tones] [suspenseful tones] [animal screeches] [Tim screams] [metal clanging] [Jade] Tim! You retard! [water sloshing] Look at this thing! [animal growls] What kind of messed up work does your dad do down here? I don't know. Well, how the hell are we supposed to liberate that? [stair squeaking] Shh! Hide! [suspenseful tones] [water dripping] [soft, ominous tones] [Hudak] Piper! Piper! [soft, suspenseful tones] [door creaking open] Is that it? I don't think so. [scuttling] [shallow breathing] Jesus, fuck! Man down! [Hudak] Man down! [radio static] [Turner] Hudak? [scuttling] [deep, ominous tones] [radio static] [Turner] Hey... [sinister, scuttling] [Turner] Hudak! [Turner] Let's go. [door creaking] [door slams] [explosion] [Hudak breathing heavily] [banging, scuttling] [Turner] Hudak! Report on location. [Hudak] Containment. He's just He's just... I don't know! [scuttling] [piercing explosion] [sucking sounds] [radio static] Hudak? Lucky you're behind that glass Tuna Roll! [Jade] Cut it out! -[Tim] Wassup. So what do you think they meant? Is that it... -They were talking about us. -So we're 'it'? I don't think so, Jade. Well, what else would it be? I hope Fix is okay. [water dripping] [scuttling] [soft, sinister tones] [metal clanging] [sinister, scuttling] [Fix] Oh, sweet Jesus! [footsteps on metal] [surveillance video buzzing] [surveillance video buzzing] Here we go. [keyboard typing] [Tim] Ah, there's my girl! [Turner] Don't touch that shit. It could be contagious. Isaacs. What the fuck's the deal down here? [Turner] We've got two men down. -Is the experiment contained? -[Turner] Are you listening? I have one man lying in a puddle of his own insides, the other, who the fuck knows where! So, no your little experimentis not contained. -Find it Mr. Turner and kill it. -[Turner] You already said that. What you didn't mention, was one word of a killer virus. [Dr. Woods] It isn't a virus. It's a girl. She injects people with a toxin that converts their tissues to liquid in order to feed. It isn't airborne. The puddles you are seeingare only hazardous to the touch. -Who the hell am I talking to? -Doctor Woods. [Turner] Well, Dr. Woods let me tell you both how this is going to play out. [Turner] We're coming back up that elevator. Then we'll discuss a proper fee for a hot operation and compensation for my men down. When that's done we'll come back with what we need and only then will we kill whatever the fuck that thing is! [Peter] Turner! Turner, don't you hang up on me! [banging] [Peter grunting] [surveillance video buzzing] [computer beeping] [soft, suspenseful beat] [Tim] What now? [Jade breathing heavily] [Jade] Come on Izzy! Which way? [Ali] Something's wrong. Let's find Fix and get the hell outta dodge. [soft, suspenseful beat] [footsteps on metal] [breathing heavily] [suspenseful tones build] [water dripping] What a great fucking plan. [faint scuttling] [ominous, suspenseful tones] Oh fuck, shit! Damn it! [scuttling] [ominous tone crescendo] [scuttling crescendo] Oh fuck! [scuttling] [piercing electrical flash] [dramatic, spooky tones] Okay. Sure. [piercing, electrical flash] Sure. Laced, I knew it! Are you cold? Coz, coz I am fucking freezing! Jesus. [piercing, electrical flash] [strange voices] What the f-- [piercing, electrical flash] What are you? [electrical flash] [strange voices murmuring] [sinister tones] [scuttling] Ah... c-could you please not do that? [piercing, electrical flash] [sucking sound] [Fix grunting in pain] [breathing shallowly] [electrical flash] [sucking sound enhances] [electrical flash enhances] [surveillance video buzzing] [low, ominous music] [computer beeping] [computer failure beep] [ominous, suspenseful music] [water dripping] [creepy sounds] [Reynolds] Ten years as a Muay Thai fighter [ominous scuttling] Five years in the Paratrooper Reserves. Did a stint in Bosnia. [scuttling and rattling sounds] I can kill a man in eight different ways... with a rolled up newspaper. [ominous, scuttling] So go ahead... make a move! I thought not. You're still a fucking taser cripple. [dramatic, scuttling] [metal groaning] What the fuck was that? [shallow breathing] Uh... if you could do me a favor between friends... Could you secure the elevator... while I go take a piss? Thanks! Stay there. [metal walkway rattling] [soft, scuttling] [animal noises] [soft, scuttling] [Tim] Yo, I don't think Izzy's with us anymore. [Jade] We never should've brought the thirties. I don't know what I was thinking! [Ali] Excuse me! You should've waited for Chris outside. [Jade] You should've stayed home to paint your nails. Yeah, I probably should've. Yeah! [suspenseful tones] [scuttling] [metal walkway clanging] [slow, suspenseful tones] [soft, eerie music] [creepy, animal noises] [scuttling noise enhances] [piercing, electrical flashes] [electricity flickering] [loud crash] [soft, scuttling noise] Hi... I ain't gonna hurt ya. [shallow breathing] Ya got a name lil' darling? [electrical flash] Well... I don't know how ya paid for one of them shoot lasers. [scuttling] So, what's a pretty lil' thing like you... doing' in a place like this? [scuttling enhances] [piercing, electrical flashes] Clever lil' thing ain't ya! [electrical flashes] [scuttling] Oh, that's unbelievable... [crushing, sucking sound] [Reynolds screaming] [sucking sound] [eerie tones] [electricity flickering] Hey, hey... I wouldn't go that way if I were you! Let's get the hell outa here-- Hey! What the fuck! -Who are you? Security? -Yeah... security. Hi, I'm Chris. Nice to meet you. -Where is she? -She? I don't know. what the fuck that was. But that was no chick! [computer beeping] Jesus, fu-- [computer beeping] [keyboard typing] [Chris banging on elevator door] Isaacs... he must've shut it down. And you can be damn sure he's not gonna let anyone up. Until she's contained. Hey, that sounds like not a job for night security. Shh... If she isn't contained... he will nerve gas the entire complex. [sinister tones] Oh, wait. Wait, it's gonna take some time to re-prime the system after a purge. The system has to build up enough pressure to fire the gas. So... what you're saying essentially is this place is one giant gas chamber? -Yeah, you might say. -That's great. Okay, so what the fuck do we do? I don't know. Unless... I might be able to override Isaacs from the control room in my old lab. At least delay the gas. Alright, let's go to the lab. Okay. You wanna hand that thing to a professional? Okay. Lead the way. [ambient nature calls] -[Tim] Yo does anyone else sme-- -[Jade] Smell pot? Yes. Fix is here. [ominous tones] [Jade] Fix? [Jade gasps] [panicked breathing] Fix! Fix! [eerie, sinister tones] Come on, Tim... Let him go-- Don't touch him! Don't touch him! Okay! Okay! -Okay. Okay. -[Ali] I'm so sorry... [Tim yelling] They fucking killed him! [scuttling] [metal walkway groaning] [sucking sound] [eerie, suspenseful tones] [scuttling] [electricity flickering] [Turner] Fuck me. I've never... I've never seen a dead person before. That's Fix! It's one of us. We'll get them, Tim I promise. I don't think it was them. Who else? [Ali] Look at that stuff, Jade. That's not blood. Let's get Tim cleaned up. [metal banging] [footsteps] -[Jade] Hey... Tim! -[Ali] Tim! [low, suspenseful tones] [soft, scuttling noise] [electrical flash] [Turner] Single round. Put her down. [gunshots] [low, sinister tones] Stick her down, now! [rapid fire gunshots] [bullets ricocheting] What was that, Boss? Let it go. We're not doing anything without backup. [Peter] Turner, report. [ominous tones] [water dripping] [Peter] Turner, respond. Isaacs. [Turner] We were never contracted for this. True, but here we are. [Peter] You have an hour to do the job yourselves before I engage the decontamination sequence. I cannot afford to let her get out Mr. Turner, do you your job. [Turner] How? We just emptied two mag's into her and we couldn't put her down. She's fast. [Peter] It's reflexes are heightened. She heals quickly, but she needs a substantial amount of food to do so. And I can assume we're the food. Wound her enough and she will die. She's strong, but she's not indestructible. [Peter] An-and Turner... What? [Peter] Doctor Woods is prancing around down there. He's still of some use to Chapel Pritchard. [low, dramatic music] This'll do. Let's get you guys out of there. [Ali] You know that line I was talking about? The problem is... once you've crossed it. [Jade] Tim? [water dripping] [ominous tones] [scuttling] [metal walkway groaning] [Jade] Tim... [metal on metal clanging] [Jade] Tim? [strangled noises] [Jade] Tim? [metal on metal clanging] [Tim groaning in pain] [sinister tones] [metal on metal clanging] [soft, scuttling] [electricity flickering] [electrical flickering] [strange voices] [electrical flash] [strange voices] [electrical flash] [gagging] [soft, scuttling] [scuttling crescendo] [soft, scuttling] [door opening] [soft, scuttling] [eerie tones] [electrical flash] [strange voices] [soft, scuttling] [suspenseful tone crescendo] [electrical flickering] [strange voices] [eerie scraping] [door hinge creaking] [electrical flash] [Jade yells] Tim, no! [Jade] It's okay. [Tim groans] [metal crashes] [soft, scuttling] Jade... Jade, she's freezing! [Tim breathing heavily] It's fucking cold in here. [Jade] Look at me. [Ali] We're gonna take care of you, okay? You doing' okay? [Jade] Hey! Instead of playing dress up with her. Maybe you wanna help find us a way outa here? You care so much about the damn animals. Maybe you'd like to extend some of that compassion to a human being. Yeah, probably a lab tech. One of the problem, Princess. Yeah, Jade. She looks an awful lot like a half-naked lab tech. [Ali] Stop treating everybody like the enemy, okay? Who do you think you're talking to. Why are such a bitch? [Jade] Excuse me? [Ali] Stirring' up shit's not the same as saving the world. [soft, scuttling] [Jade] I'm not stirring up shit! [Ali] Yeah. [Ali] Oh and now I forgot. Big, bad animal rights activists minus one, by my count. Don't you walk away from me. You know what. You've only been right about one thing tonight. All I wanted was to give my Dad the finger Make him notice me for once. -I'm shocked. -Jade, you're not listening to me. Take a look at around. [Tim moaning] [Jade] Fix was my damn friend... not yours! [eerie, ominous tones] Now, make yourself useful. Shut up. Have a look around. And see if you can find us a way out of here. [soft, scuttling] [strange voices] [suspenseful tones] [Chris whispers] Nice place you got here, Doc. [Dr. Woods] Yeah... we sealed it off years ago. I'm the only one that comes down here anymore. [Chris] Why? Is she contagious or something? [Dr. Woods] Not exactly. We uh... hit a wall. And Isaacs said, given the lack of results [deep, sinister tone] The experiment was too dangerous to continue. [electronic keypad beeping] [Chris] So, how did she end up like that? [door opening] [eerie, sinister tones] [computer whirring] What the hell? Find something? Something' alright. [keyboard typing] [Dr. Woods] September 9th, 1995. Results are in. All samples test negative for the malignancy. [electronic static]I've done it. I've cured cancer. [scuttling] [strange voices] Mia's treatment was uh... based on harvesting gene sequences from organisms we've been studying for their regenerative capabilities. And their ability to survive in harsh conditions. On the cusp of super-heated lava vents, under the arctic ice... Ah, so this is where Sea World goes to die? We had surprising, early success with the immune system of pigs. [Dr. Woods] I spliced new sequences into the host DNA employing a common virus as the vector via a 10CC injection. [machine whirring] So pig's enhanced immune systems wiped out the cancer, in 3 days. [electricity flickering] But, when we moved to human test cases the treatment just didn't work. [Dr. Woods] I decided on a hunch to use a weakened strain of Ebola... as the vector. Is that? [video static] [Dr. Woods] The treatment worked quickly and impressively. It looks like... could be... [Dr. Woods] Her body wiped out the cancer in a day. [strange voices] [electricity flickering] But, Mia's DNA mutated in ways we didn't predict. Her immune system... intensified to the point where her regeneration was off the chart. Her cellular growth became erratic and... unpredictable. The cure... came at a cost. So you don't get out to the movies much, do ya Doc? [Dr. Woods] In the end... I don't know what she became. [computer beeps] [sighs] Oh! God damn it! Isaacs has shut everyone out of the system, except himself. Got a plan B? Well at least I can try and get the containment grid back online We have to find Alison and-- Hey, Chr-Chris! Come on. Get away from there. [laughs] Dude, you sounded just like my mother just now. She would always tell me to get away from the fridge. [dramatic music] Chris! [Chris] Hey! What, are you just gonna sit there? Or are you gonna open that goddamn door? [Dr. Woods] Her strength and... speed have become difficult to chart. And her appetite... [video static] Three nurses... and a security guard, dead. Now we have a fucking problem! ...down using a highly concentrated dose of an anti-toxin developed by the CDC to combat botulism. [soft, scuttling] [sinister tones] But, even then... we lost two more just... trying to get the needle in her arm. Don't look at me. You fucking dressed her up! ...move Mia into a reinforced cryogenic containment tank... [scuttling]for her safety... and ours... [dramatic tones] Listen. Chris. You have no idea what you're dealing with here. [Chris] Yes, I do. Very expensive stuff. [soft, dramatic tones] That's gonna make me very rich. Right? Now, open the goddamn door. [keypad beeping] Alright, hand me the black one. Oh, yes! Thank you. Alright, get up! Unfortunately, I'm gonna have to handcuff you. I'm really good with these things. Your daughter, Ali... She loved them. Mm. She was good too. You're the new boyfriend. Yep. Guess you could say that. [Dr. Woods cries out] [Jade] Tim... sweetie... We have to bail. Just don't make any sudden movements. So, she killed Fix? [suspenseful tones] [strange voices] Did you kill my fucking friend? [yelling] [electricity flickering] [Tim screaming] [electrical flashes] [Tim] Go. Go! [Ali] Jade, move! [electricity flickering] [Tim groans] [door opening] [Turner] Freeze! [Ali] Don't shoot! [Turner] She in there? [Ali screaming] Yeah! [Turner] Move! [scuttling] [rapid-fire gunshots] [gunshots end] You've got to be kidding me. -What if Tim's still alive? -What if she is? [dramatic music] [shallow breathing] [door bangs open] [breathing heavily] [Turner] Run! [electricity flickering] [yells] Run! [gunshots] [footsteps running] [suspenseful music] Ali! [scuttling] Ali! [dramatic music] -[Chris] Sweetie... -Chris? -Hey! Oh... -Oh! You okay? I can't believe what my dad's been doing here! I know, tell me about it! [soft, scuttling] [gunshots] -[Jade] We gotta book! -[Chris] Oh shit. No, no, no, no! Not that way! -[Jade] Why not? -[Chris] Oh... [gunshots] [Chris] Run! Go! -I don't see them. -[Chris] I don't care. -[Jade] I don't see them. -Shut the door. -Tim's still out there-- -I don't give a shit! [Chris] Shut the goddamn door now! [Jade gasps] [door slams] [dramatic, suspenseful music] [scuttling] [Turner] Now... [Tim groans] [Tim screams in pain] [heavy breathing] [soft, scuttling noise] Did they see? Yeah... you got some great friends there. [electricity flickering] [scuttling] [dramatic tones] [Jade] You fucking asshole. -Chris... please open the door. -What? Ali, are you fucking nuts? You psycho! [Chris yelling] No, no, no, no! Back the fuck up! Sit down. Sit down, both of you. Sit down. I'm sorry! I'm sorry... It's very insensitive. You know what? Maybe we could uh... I don't know we can... Hold a candlelight visual for him. You know... in remembrance. But, for now... What I need you guys to do is be two good little girls. Sit down, and shut the fuck up. [dramatic, sinister tones] [Turner] Let's see how she likes this. [suspenseful tones] [explosion] [dramatic tones] [electricity flickering] [suspenseful tones] [Turner] Unbelievable. You kids sure know how to fuck things up nice. [scuttling] I'm gonna give you a little piece of advice. Man, to man. [scuttling] [Turner cries out in pain] In a couple of years... when this anarchy shit stops getting you laid... You're gonna fucking hope... no one was taking pictures. [ominous tones] [strange voices] So, Holy Road. Holy Road. [Turner] Sure, man. Sure. [electricity flickering] [soft, scuttling] [suspenseful music] [electricity flickering] [crashing] [sucking sound] [trickling sound] [dramatic, suspenseful music] [scuttling] [Tim groans] [electrical flashes] [dramatic tones] [crashing] [sucking sound] I'm going to kill you. Good one, Jade. Why are you doing this? For the money, what do you think! God, you're stupid! [Chris] Ali... What are you mad at me? Come on! Ali! Ali. Hey, hey! Look at me. Look at me. Look at me. [Ali cries out] I never meant to hurt you. I swear. I'll never hurt you again. Look at me. [dramatic music] What? What? What are you gonna do? Break up with me? [laughs] [electrical flash] [crashing] [sinister tones] [Jade and Ali gasp] [Ali cries out] [Jade] Shit! [Chris] No way! [Jade and Ali] Oh god! What's your plan now, asshole? [gunshot] Okay. Okay. I got an idea. You two distract that thing. And... I make an escape in the confusion. What d'ya think? Fuck you. [Chris laughs] Come on! Don't be so dramatic! We had some good times. We had some laughs. Hopefully, I wish we had some fuckin'. But... I'm gonna go now. Ali... Again... I'm sorry. [suspenseful tones] I gotta go. Say hi to your dad for me. [Ali cries out angrily] [Ali crying] [crying] This is all played out, Ali. We're gonna die. No, we're not. [dramatic music crescendo] [computer beeping] [keyboard typing] [sighs] Fine. Let's go to Plan B. Control room's gotta be around here somewhere. Gotcha! [dramatic, suspenseful music] I can't see her anywhere. [dramatic tones] Hey Ali... Who the hell is this? [Ali gasps] Dad! Dad. [Dr. Woods mumbles] [Dr. Woods groans] -Dad... -Oh, thank God you're okay! What are you doing here? [Jade] Oh... I see you met the boy. Yeah... Dad... what did you think you were doing down here at that girl? I was trying to save her! So, you're the big brain. Doesn't matter... Isaacs is going to fill this place with nerve gas. [suspenseful tones] It'll kill Maya. And all of us. Then we wait out the gas, Dad. Those guards all have masks. We'll just, we'll grab a few. Those masks will only cut down on the amount you breathe in. It won't eliminate it. They won't save us. [dramatic music] So we are all played out. If I can get Maya back in the tank... Isaacs should let us out. [Ali] Dad... I can't even get you off this wall. Here. Let me. [dramatic, suspenseful tones] [Dr. Woods sighs in relief] [Dr. Woods] Here... Ah! Thanks. [dramatic music] [Dr. Woods] Okay. This way! It leads directly to the containment room. Except the door's fucked-- How do we know Isaacs isn't just gonna turn on the gas? We don't. Stand back. [gas leaking] [explosion] [frantic, scuttling] [crashing] [suspenseful music] [keyboard typing] [computer beeps] [electronic beep] [phone ringing] Working late, Mr. Woods. [video static]Give us a chance, Peter. I'll get her to the tank. Then you can kill her. Oh, I see. So you're back on board now, are you? Peter... please! [video static] Sydney. How exactly are you planning on doing this? Same as last time. [Peter] Oh, okay. I get it. So, you're just gonna stroll up to her and she's gonna let you stick another needle in her. Not exactly. [video static] Think of it as... Sugar coated. I'll get her to the tank but you will have to fire the containment department. How will you find her? She's always hungry. Well, then. Do be sure to be careful, Sydney. Peter, I'll do this! But I'm sending the girls to the elevator. You have to let them up. This is our mess, not theirs. Alright. You have your chance. They're coming up now. Understood. But, in ten minutes if I don't see her in that cage... [video static]Assume the worst. [dramatic music] Now, we've got ten minutes at best. [Dr. Woods] Let's go. Ten minutes? Could you cut it a little closer [Dr. Woods] You have to hurry. Go through the airlock, follow the long corridor to decontamination. And take the elevator. Go! Dad! I'm not leaving you. You have to. There's nothing' you can do here. Yeah, but Doc... [Ali] What are you gonna do? Once I get her inside the ring, Isaacs will drop the cage and seal the tank. [dramatic music] Then, he can localize the nerve gas inside and kill her there. And you trust him? I have to. The controls are too far from the cage. -I can't do it alone. -[Ali] Dad, let me stay! I can activate the tank for you. No, Ali! Now, you two go to the-- [Ali] No! I don't wanna go! [dramatic music] Look, there's nothing you can do to help me here. I need to know that at least you're safe. Go! Take her! -Go on, sweetheart. -Come on, Ali. It's okay. [dramatic, suspenseful music] Your dad will be fine. Let's stick to the plan. [sinister music] [scuttling noise] [strange creature calls] [electricity flickering] [metal clanging] [scuttling] [ominous quiet] [Chris laughs] You haven't hurt me, bitch.

[screeching] Attention. Decontamination protocol has been activated. [Ali] I'm going back. That isn't the deal. -Your dad told us to get out! -He needs my help. Attention. Decontamination protocol has been activated. What the hell? Open the door! Open the fucking door! Open the fucking door, now. Please! Goddamn it! [keyboard typing] [phone keypad beeping] [computer beeping] [Peter] Murray, it's Peter. Yeah, we're gonna need a clean-up crew at the lab. Physical, media... the whole works. [soft, suspenseful music] Better get PR here as well. [Peter groans] Please, don't you all be dead. [surveillance video buzzing] Thank you! [keyboard typing] The decontamination sequence will commence in seven minutes. [Ali whispering] Dad? [soft, scuttling] [sinister music] [Ali] Dad! Dad! [electricity flickering] [scuttling] [electrical flashes] [piercing electrical flashes] Come on! [piercing shrieking] [Ali yelling] What, now you run? [screaming] Come on! I'm right here. [dramatic, suspenseful music] -The decontam-- -[Jade yelling] Ali? -sequence will commence-- -Shut that door! She's in here somewhere. Okay, great. [suspenseful music] [Ali yelling] Come on! I'm right here! Shit. [breathing heavily] [Ali yelling] Come on! What are you waiting for? Ali! We don't have time for this shit. We need to leave now! Wake up! She's not in the tank. [Ali] We're already dead. You lie down if you want to. But I know that I've had more than enough of this bitch! Then, where is she? I don't know. We don't have a ton of time here Ali. Do you see any other way? [dramatic music] Go to the controls. The decontamination-- [Ali] Come on! Sequence will commence in four minutes. [keyboard typing] Damn good thing I can do two at a time! You see her yet? You'd know it if I did. Alright, keep moving! [suspenseful music crescendo] [crash] [sucking sound] Attention, all personnel. Please evacuate the lower labs immediately. Jade, you catch that? [scuttling] Jade! [screams] Jade! [dramatic music] [Ali screaming] Jade! [suspenseful music] [yelling] That was my father that did that to you! And you know what... I'm glad! You're just a failed, fucking experiment! [scuttling] [electrical flashes] [crashing] [electricity flickering] [gasps] [scuttling] [strange voices] [electrical flash] Attention, all personnel.

[Chris] Now, now. Don't curse like that. If you're gonna do it, just do it. Do what? Kill you. I don't need to. Ali, listen to me. We can share the ride together. I got what I wanted. People dies because of you. Asshole! Ah, get real! Look around you. What'd I have to do with this? Huh? [electrical flash] [Chris] So we're agreed? [electrical flash] Except for karma, baby!
