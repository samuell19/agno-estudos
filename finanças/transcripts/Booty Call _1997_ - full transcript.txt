I ain't never did this shit before. Now, how you do it? You just throw it like that? Oh! Boo-yeah. Look like I win. Man, if you don't get your hands off my money-- Please? Yeah, that's the way you roll. Roll again, right? MAN: Yeah. Roll that shit again. Cool. Gotta put your money in if you wanna play, now. Can't win unless you play. Come on. You gotta throw it in there. There we go. Right? Right? Am I right? Roll, man. Oops! Slipped right out my hand. MAN: Aw, man! Yo, Bunz, we gotta go. Oh, no. Seriously, man. His sister's got some ill will and everything, and this is goin' to a good cause. I'm sorry I gotta go like this. Hey, look, man. Next time, if you want to keep your shit, you gotta know when to quit. Let's leave quickly. Brothers, y'all stay broke. I mean, uh, stay black. Hey, you lucky you stopped me when you did, bro. I was about to buy a condo up in Midtown. Oh, I'm lucky I stopped you when I did? I can see myself explaining to Nikki now. "Oh, baby, the reason why we was late, is because Bunz was on his knees playin' dice." Hey, I wasn't just playing. I was the M.V.P. You ain't hear the roar of the crowd? [IMITATES CHEERING] Here. I guess you don't want your cut. I ain't say all that. WOMAN: Fuck you, motherfucker! Get the fuck outta my shit. 'Cause I don't need your ass! Go back to your skank ho, 'cause she called and left her fuckin' number, and I caught your ass in the act, motherfucker! Duck feet, big-nosed, pop-eyes, receding-hairline-- Truth is you can't win. Truth is you can't win. Let me see you rise now. Let me see you rise now, motherfucker! Nope! I don't think so! You ain't got to take that. Jab back, baby. Jab back. Oh! Hold up one motherfuckin' minute! Goddamn it, when I need Howard Cosell, I will call Howard Cosell! So take your fake-dredded ass, pick up Mighty Mouse... and skippity-do your rank, Scoobidy-Doo ass home, motherfucker. Take that. BUNZ: Better run, man! Got a greyhound on your back! See? That's what I'm talkin' about. That's why I don't like relationships. That's why I strictly deal with booty calls. 3:00 a.m.'s. No questions asked. Speakin' of that, I don't want to do this blind-date thing. All right? I'm gonna go ahead let you do your thing, but I'm gonna go back and try to win me some money. Hey, you can do what you want, Bunz, okay? But this girl is fine. Mrs. Butterworth fine. It's up to you. Yeah, well, Mrs. Butterworth give me gas. Rushon, define "fine." What does the girl look like? 'Cause I ain't gonna be sittin' at the table with no hamhock-eatin' wildebeest. I got a reputation, you know? I try to keep my little game tight. Yeah, well, what about that fruit bat you left the party with the other night? Oh, yeah. You know, I was gonna tell you about that. I think old girl put somethin' in my drink, man. I'm serious, 'cause you know I wouldn't go out like that. Come on, man. The girl had a beard. She did not have a beard. She had a beard! She had a hair-- She did not have a beard. She had a goatee. But it was real nice and thin... If your girl ain't Chinese, then why the hell she live way down here in Chinatown? RUSHON: Hey, man. This is a good neighborhood. She got a nice apartment, and her girlfriend live across the hall. BUNZ: Oh, I see what you're doin'. The girlfriend is Chinese. You thought I'd be upset. I ain't trippin' that. I don't mind havin' a little Rice Krispies on my plate. That mean she knows how to pan fry this noodle, you know? She's not Chinese, Bunz. Then what's goin' on? Watch yourself. Hey, I don't care if she Chinese or not. She can still snuggle up on these egg rolls, you know? And they low in fat. See, that's the reason I never take your ass nowhere. Now, you know you take me everywhere you go. Look, if I was a girl, we'd be datin' right now. So Rushon's friend is cute, right? Oh, he's cute enough. No, no, no. You said he was cute. Lystie, I'm not askin' you to have the man's baby. I'm just askin' you to run a little interference for me. You know what I'm sayin'? Okay. But he does have class though, right? 'Cause you know I do not mess with anyone that does not have class. Trust me. He is in a class all by hisself. Yo, man. What kinda name is "Lystie" anyway? It's short for "Lysterine." Lysterine? That's a motherfuckin' mouthwash, man. What's up with these whack-ass names? I went out with this girl, her name was Gonor-rhea, right? But she spelled the shit like "gonorrhea." I can't put that on no postcard. It's Lysterine with a "Y", not an "I". Oh! That makes all the difference in the world, Rushon. Look, that's not the point. The point is you doing this for me. Right, right, right. Now, I been goin' out with Nikki for seven weeks-- Seven weeks? Seven weeks and you ain't hit that ass yet? Hey, man, I like her. Oh. "I like her." Nikki, why are you taking so long? I can't go out like this. Here we go. Like what? My cleavage is hangin' out. Cleavage? I don't want to send out the wrong signal. What do you think? I think that anyone that's put up with you for seven weeks deserves some nay-nay. Oh, really? Nikki. Why are you makin' Rushon wait so long? He seems like he's a good man. He's got a career. He treats you nice. I know. I-- I just want to make sure that he's the right one. Just don't leave me alone with him. Mmm. Sounds like he's not the only one feelin' the seven-week itch. [BOTH LAUGH] It is not even like that. Well, you better watch that smile of his. Can we please go? All right. BUNZ: You know, this is how I peep the situation. Excuse me, Bruce Lee. I think college got you too sensitive. Sensitive? Yeah, I mean, 'cause you ain't got no player left in you. I wouldn't let the sun rise over the East River without taggin' that ass tonight. 'Cause if it was me, I'd have that ass bouncin' like a low rider in a Dr. Dre video. I say, "Miss Nikki, tonight is the night. It's a one-time offer." She want to give it to you tomorrow, you say, "Hey, can't do that. Tomorrow's too late." It's not that simple. You right. It's not simple for somebody who's, uh, slippin'. Could you put me in the players' section, please? Hey, Bunz, I'm not slippin'. You slippin' like a mo'fucker. Look, Nikki and I are going to do our thing tonight. She knows it, and I know it. Of course. I don't know why I disrespected you. But, uh, listen. You're a gambling man. Why don't you put your money where your mack is? I'm not gonna bet money on somethin' like that. We don't have to bet money. Let's just make it a gentlemen's bet. We're gentlemen, right? You not gonna let this go? Come on, big daddy, big player, big pimp, big baller. [SIGHS] There you go. That's my boy. You go the fuck on. Oh, he's celebrating his bar mitzvah. You know, he just got circumcised and everything. Go on with your food. I never did learn how to do this... Oh! Rushon. It's so good to see you this evening. And who is your friend? Hello. My name is Chan, and I'm here to serve you tonight. [GIGGLES] Hey! Bro. Rushon? Chan, we're waiting on our dinner guests. Mmm, I think your hair is three things: fab-u-lous. [LAUGHS] Well, I got three things for you: Back up, Yoko Ono. Oh, nigga, please. Man. They're here. All right, Bunz, look, these girls got a lot of class, all right? So act like you got a little bit of sense. Like you got a mama. Like you wasn't mixed up in some test tube. I just think we should move to a table with better light. What's wrong with the light we got here? No, I'm tired of hookin' up with ladies under muted light. I need to get a good look. Because anybody can look good in dim light. How many times you go to a club and under the disco lights the girl look good as a motherfucker? You giggin' and havin' a good time. But the next day, you go to pick her up. You all happy and shit, but it's high noon. She comes out the house, and a fuckin' sea donkey climbs into your car. All I'm sayin' is I believe in a brother's right to know what the hell he's feedin'-- Man, just get up. Lysterine, this is Rushon's friend, Bunz. Hey, now. I was thinkin' that, uh-- Damn. Excuse us. What do you think you are doing? Did you see that tarantula hair, fool? Motherfucker looked like Predator. It's just dinner. Some egg rolls, a little mu shu, and we out. Girl, why are you trippin? She don't look like she want my shit, man. Nah, man, she's on you. She's just a little nervous. It's a blind date, right? Right. Right. Everybody's got a weakness. Who knows? You and Bunz just might hit it off. "Bunz"? You blind-date me with a little hood rat named "Bunz"? Girl, have you lost your mind? No. I can't get with a brother named Bunz. No, but it's Bunz with a "Z," not an "S." You know-- [HUFFS BREATH] You never can be too, you know, too ready. Just do this for me, please? You owe me. Big time. Now, let's roll. [MAKING BEAT BOX SOUNDS] ♪ Ladies, you look good ♪ So, uh, whassup? Nothing. Are we ready to order? Uh, as a matter of fact, I am. I want the shrimp fried rice. Uh, make that two, please. Perfect. I will have the prawns in garlic sauce. Mmm. And you, Miss Thing? [LAUGHS] Excuse me? Yeah, you got her with the Miss Thing. Give it up. You eating or just looking? Okay, boyfriend. I want a lobster tail in butter-wine sauce, and we girls want a bottle of Moet. Damn, girl. Why you gotta order the most expensive shit on the menu? Rushon, you need to check your boy. Check, my ass. That's what I'm talkin about, is a check. Now, the lobster don't even have a price next to it. It just says "seasonal." So you know what that means. A brother gotta pay $28. And hey, if I get you some lobster and some Moet, you know what's happenin' after that. No. What does happen? I'm goin' deep-sea divin'. [CHUCKLES] Bunz, this is a platinum card. I could buy and sell your ashy, black, blue-collared ass. Is that right? Yes, it is. Well, lookie here. W-What is that? It's a gold gas card. Yeah. That means I can buy all the gas I want. In all 50 states and 11 foreign countries. And I got platinum privileges too, 'cause if you buy enough gas, they give you coffee mugs and stuff. Bunz, why you got a gas card? You don't even got a car. Yo, man, why you put me on Front Street, man? I'll have you to know that I laid away a '68 Chevy Super Sport, with a 427 cubic-inch twin cam with a Hurst gear shifter. Ooh, sounds like a man who has some serious doubts about his manhood. Those cars are nothing but extensions of your penis, or lack thereof. Yeah. You know what? You right, 'cause my dick is only two inches... from the ground. Isn't he grand? BUNZ: Can't get a brother's order straight. Look here, I ordered shrimp fried rice. Can I get some shrimp? Oh, there is one shrimp there. And another shrimp here. See, what's with all the green leafy stuff? You tryin' to fool a brother with all the shrubbery. Child! That's garnishment. Make your food look good. [GIGGLES] What would make my food look good is five extra shrimp. Oh. I thought there was no smoking in this restaurant. [CLEARS THROAT] I'll take care of this. Bunz. Sit down. That's the notorious Ug Lee, the godfather of the Leuang Triad. He runs Chinatown. Yeah, I know. I got all his albums. I'll tell him you said "What's up?" But, wha-- [SPEAKS CHINESE] [CLEARS THROAT] [SPEAKS CHINESE] I know you impressed. You probably thought I was some old common hood rat, huh? [SPEAKS CHINESE] RUSHON: Bunz, I didn't know you spoke Chinese. Well, it wasn't like I could speak it to your ass. So where'd you learn? Watching kung fu movies. Me and my father, we always watched kung fu movies. But they got subtitles. Yeah. Well, our TV didn't have a vertical hold. So what I'd do is I'd get the kung fu videos and listen to 'em, and then bit by bit, I started understandin' them motherfuckers. Like one time I went down to the Chinese laundry, right? And that shit that sound like "ping-tang pang-tang ping-pang" started makin' sense to a brother. So why didn't y'all just buy a new television? Well, everybody ain't got no platinum card. You know, they is some po' folk out in the world. How's your shrimp, baby? He ain't got no shrimp over there. Oh. Here's one. You can have it, baby. Oh. Oh, my goodness. You whipped. That boy is whipped. You know what? You need to pay attention and learn. All he did was gave you a ol' crusty-ass shrimp. There's that hood rat emerging again. [SPEAKING CHINESE] [SPEAKS CHINESE] [SHOUTING IN CHINESE] No fighting in restaurant. Cost you extra to fight in restaurant. [BOTH SHOUT IN CHINESE] Fuck me? [CHAN SHOUTS IN CHINESE] BOTH: My mother?

I thought I'd put on some mood music so we could dance a little, Nikki. Rushon, I think you have done enough dancin' for tonight. Nikki, come on. You got the ambience here. You know how we do it, girl. Look, the only reason why we came up here is to play some cards. After that, you two are goin' home. [GROWLING] BUNZ: Dog, if you don't get-- What is this? Hey, I'm gon' kick your ass. [DOG GROWLS AND BARKS] Um, leave Killa alone. He does live here, and you are visiting, Bunz. Well, if we was really in China, I'd have his ass honey-roasted. Play, Nikki. Ha! [LAUGHS] Somebody cheatin', all right? Something's goin' on. I wish somethin' was goin' on. Y'all just mad 'cause you losin'. I heard that, Rushon. Uh-oh. Caught you slippin' again. [SNICKERS] Oh, that's funny to y'all? A guy go out with a girl seven weeks and don't get no intimacy, and that's funny to y'all? Maybe the girl wants a more profound relationship. Maybe she's not interested in having casual sex. Maybe the girl wants a deeper commitment. Maybe the girl wants a soul mate. Maybe the girl's got some soul-searchin' to do. Maybe the girl got a brother with 9 inches of ding-dong knockin' the bottom out yo' ass. Shut up! Shut up! I'm just sayin', I think it's a legitimate question. If I was goin' out with a girl for seven weeks, you know what she'd be doin'? She'd be playin' the meat flute. Ridin' the baloney pony. Eatin' on some tube steak, but you gotta work a little bit for the gravy. Can I get some? [FART NOISE] 'Scuse me. Thank you so much for sharing that with us. I been tryin' to share this big paloosa with you all night, but you-- [YAWNS] Oh, boy. Am I getting tired. Ain't you tired, Bunz? You know what? I'm gettin' tired myself. It is gettin' a little late, though. Lystie. Nikki. It is gettin' late. [YAWNING] Well, since y'all are tired, and we definitely tired, y'all go ahead and we'll find somethin' to do. No, let's still play cards. Ain't nobody goin' nowhere. So, Lystie? What? Can I ask you a hypothetical question? Have you ever made a brother wait seven weeks to get up on that thing? Why are you askin' her? She ain't never made a man wait 30 minutes. [SNIFFS] [IN ENGLISH ACCENT] Do I smell a whore? No, no, no, no, no. See, I have full confidence in my sexuality, and I don't toil over it, unlike some prudes I know. Prude? Prude. Ha! Oh, see, I am nobody's prude. I just don't want to rush into having sex. See, that may be hard for you to understand. Oh, really? Well, you might be able to understand that if you cleared away some of those cobwebs from your cootchie, mommy. Cootchie cobwebs? [IMITATING CAT MEWLING AND HISSING] Why don't we just deal here? Don't stop 'em now. I wanna see 'em box. Let's get ready to rumble! So, what's up? Y'all ready for another one?

Men like, uh, Jesse Jackson. Jesse Jackson? Yes! Do Jesse. You mean, "The hands that used to pick cotton can now pick the president"? Oh, yeah. Oh, shit. TV NARRATOR: The rhinoceros, though not as prolific as others in the animal kingdom, is nonetheless as enthusiastic. Watch as the 4,000-pound beast rises to the occasion. Wax that 4,000-pound ass. [DOG BARKS] Look-- Killa. Killa, stop that. No. [BARKS] Oh, that's all right. He's only human, right? Now, how come you didn't pet Killa when Bunz was here? I think he's a bad influence on you. I do. [AS JESSE JACKSON] Just let me say that the ass is round. Ooh. And you know that I'm down. Bipartisan. [MOANS] And we can work it to the ground. Oh, yes!

Smack my ass. Hallelujah! Do you know how sweet you are? How nice you are? Then your boys come around and it's like, "What's up, nigga?" Now who you checkin' for? Me or Bunz? Hmm? You. [AS MIKE TYSON] I'm the heavyweight boxing champion. Yes, Mike! Yes, Mike! I don't care what people say. You know it's just ludicrous how soft your skin is. Oh, it's soft for you, my baby. It reminds me of the leather on the first pair of gloves I had. Oh, yes! Work it. It makes me want to work out. Oh, work it, Mike! Work it, Mike! Just work it. I'm just so vicious. Ooh! Oh, work it! Oh, yes, Mikey! Work it! Work it! Work it! Work it! Aah! [BOTH MOANING] Wait. What? What? What? What? Rushon, do you have a condom? Because I want this. I just don't want to die for it. A condom?

And then I work my way on down to the love triangle. Yes. You know you like it. First, I start kissin' it, and I'm lickin' it, because I'm thinkin' 'bout stickin' it. And then when I get through, it'll be smooth and creamy, just like the Jell-O pudding. Ooh. Get your ass off-- Gimme this goddamned condom, you little-- NIKKI: Rushon! [BARKS] [PANTING] Ah. There you go. [DOG GROWLING] You know a dog's mouth is cleaner than a human's. Rushon. You thought I'd use this on you after it's been in a dog's mouth? Mm-hmm.

No, you ain't, girl. Come on. What are you doin'? Let the boy do what he do. Mm-hmm, and I'm gonna do what I do. [RINGING] BUNZ: Shit is throwin' me off. Hold on. Let me listen. [AS MARTIN LUTHER KING] Longevity has its place. I may not get to the mountaintop with you, but I want you to know that I have a dream. Oh, I have a dream too. I have a dream that one day every valley shall be explored. Explore! Every hill and every mountain shall be fondled. I have a dream that all the rough places will be laid smooth, and all the crooked places laid straight. Lay it straight! Then I can look down upon that beautiful woman and say-- What you gonna say? I'll wax that ass. I'll wax that ass. Good Lord, have mercy. I'll wax that ass. Say it, brother! Ooh, I'm-a go bananas up in that rump shaker. Lystie, what are you over there doing? Oh! Nikki, uh... nothin'. Nothin', my ass. She-- I know that you are not over there having unprotected sex with Martin Luther King. Unsafe sex can be deadly. You know that. Well, Nik, Dr. King's about to rock my world. Girl, have you lost your mind? You don't know Bunz. You don't know where he came from. You don't know that boy from a can of paint. Girl, you better go get you a condom. Nikki. Lystie. You take a hard look at Bunz and tell me that you don't need a condom. Bunz, I got nothin' to do with this-- What the problem is? We gon' do this or what? Hey, look, Bunz. I'm sorry. Hey, hey, don't even worry about it. Let's just go get the condoms. [LAUGHING] No, it is not what you think. Yes, it is. Nikki's about to get her groove on. No, no, no, no, no. See, I told him he can go to the store, pick up some condoms and that's it. RUSHON: Let's just do what we got to do tonight, all right? BUNZ: I was doin' what I had to do. I don't know about you, but I was doin' everything I had to do to get what I needed to do done. Wait. You gonna give the brother the keys to the car and not let him drive that thing? What? Now, why are you askin' all of these questions, Miss All-Up-In-My-Business? What are you gonna be doin'? Would you really like to know what I'm gon' be doin'? Oh, God. I don't even want to know. No. Since you asked, I feel I should be at liberty to share it with you.

Yo, man, if you get those, you better hit some Nikki skins. That's what I'm sayin'. Hey, what other choice have we got? Well, you know, like me, I just put the tip in. Hey, you might not be puttin' nothin' in. Hey, tonight, before the sun rises. Hey, look, all I need is one. I just wash it out and use it again. Recycle, baby. [DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES] I'm back. Nikki. Yeah. Champagne. Ha-ha! "Open me." I can do that. Well, at least I think I can. Get your-- Hi. RUSHON: Whoa! Just got a little excited. Maybe I should put this thing on ice, huh?

Condom condoms, babe. Rushon, these are lambskin. Don't you listen to the Surgeon General? Lambskin condoms don't protect you against the transmission of the HIV virus. Baby, I'm government-tested Grade "A." Clear as a bell. Don't even go there. Yeah, but-- Rushon, just go to the store and get some latex. Okay? Please? Latex. Lay-tex. [SIGHS] Goddamn sheep.

Well, see his nasty, little rodent ass out to the curb. He's got a point, my friend. So you been lookin' at the dog's ass? He's got a point too. One to one. What? What? I'm on your side. You started this shit. Hey, y'all got kerosene? Aisle two. Aisle three. You move the kerosene, you got to tell me when you move things. I have to tell you everything? I'd like to fuck the dog. Do I have to tell you that too? Way too much information. [BARKS] [DOOR CHIME JINGLES] Okay, Singh, I need some latex condoms, okay? They got to be latex. Hey, Mr. Black Man. I can't see you. Come to the front. Rushon, You came to the right place. We have Ginza, Sheik, Hot Tamale. Booty Call, Back Door Man, Manhandlers. Ramrod, Lube Job, In Deep. Joy Trail, Buck Wild and Goodyear Eagles.

I don't think you want them. They are for gay men. Don't wanna go there. I don't know. You could be a bit of a doo-doo chaser. You know, a sodomite, with hair like that. Oh, no. Hell, no. Y'all got me fucked up. I like the fuzzy stuff, don't get me wrong. My hair is a statement of my individuality. Like I said-- a sodomite. Or sodom-maybe. Ha-ha! Very good. High-two. Oh, yeah.

That's one thing I don't do, man, and that's lie. All right, then. When Nikki is crying on Lysterine's shoulder, then what you gon' do? Let's get our story straight. [BARKING] [SIGHS] No story required. Come on, B. [BARKING] Shh! Don't be givin' 'body up. What happened? What took you guys so long? Oh, hey. Um, me and Killa started playin'. Lost track of time.

I wish I was in Bombay, to deal with you-- Go to Bombay, then. I'm not staying. You see who we gettin' it from now? And they got a point. These women are runnin' us. We not runnin' them. And do you see how expensive this shit is? Singh, you got anything cheaper? MAN: Rushon! Come up here, boy. Damn! Judge Peabody. He go to my mother's church. He a holy roller too. Hey, Judge. Rushon, what you doin' out? Uh, we just came to get a sandwich. Ain't nothin' out this late but the devil and the devil's helper. Hey, Judge. Uh-- All right. You want that Glad Wrap? Glad Wrap at 2:00 in the mornin'? Looks like you plannin' on eatin' more than a sandwich. Your mother know what you out here doin'? Well, she, um-- Look here, son. It's bad enough you plannin' to fornicate. Now, don't compound the crime by lyin'. See, lies are the oil that grease the track, the one way to desolution. Now, I know condoms and Glad Wrap, it has its place in the pantheon of safe sex. But it's only one way to be totally safe, and that's abstinence and purity. And sexual frustration. Hey, listen, I know how you all feel when that furry temptress seem like she's callin' yo' name. She say, "Come on, Rushon! Get some! Put yo' hand on it! "Look, you want some of it? Rub it on in there. "You want me to rub it? Well, you bite me! Suck it, you filthy--" You know. Things like that. You know. Man. You got my nipples hard. Watch how you talk to me. I'm-- I'm sorry? I'm sorry for you. I'm tryin' to help you. See, that's when you gotta be strong. That's why you have to take a pledge. I swear on the seal of this great state of New York...

I have to take, uh, my clerk home. I told you I was comin' out. You didn't have to come in. Uh, look man. I'm a little low on cash. Y'all got anything cheaper than this? Oh, that's the 300. The 100 is back on the shelf. Just come on, man. We runnin' outta time. I don't trust those boys. Oh, my God. You know what I think, Akmed? I think that that girl was the judge's fuzzy temptress. Furry temptress. What is the difference? You don't know the difference? Put the money in the bag. Just a minute. We are talking. Furry is here, fuzzy is here-- Hey! I said put the money in the bag. Your customer. Listen, you Pakistani piece of shit, do what I say. Listen, you crack addict, we are not Pakistani. We are Punjabis. I could pass for Pakistani. Oh, shit, Bunz. These motherfuckers are gettin' jacked. Oh. As soon as he shoots them, I'm gonna go get some groceries. You want some bread and eggs? Bunz, do you ever use the left side of your brain? All the time.

Seven-weeks ready. Shit. Nikki! This plastic ain't easy to come by, girl. You don't know what I been through. But I think I finally got this safe-sex thing down pat. NIKKI: Are you sure you know what you're doing? Do I know what I'm doin'? I know what I'm doin'. Say you want some dental dam, I got your dental dam. Build your ass a Hoover Dam. That's what I'll do. I'm gonna wax that ass tonight. It's my turn to do what I do. [DOG BARKS] You shut up, or I'll wrap your ass like a hot dog. [GROWLING AND BARKING] Nikki! Nikki! Nikki! [MUFFLED YELL] [COUGHS AND YELLS] [GRUNTS AND COUGHS] Oh, my God, Rushon. Rushon, Rushon, Rushon, Rushon. [POPS] [GASPS AND COUGHS] Come on, sit up so you can get some air. Sit up. Okay. Okay.

Rushon, you almost died. [COUGHING] Oh, my God. You are the only man in this world I know dumb enough to do something like this. [GRUNTING] Gotta help a brother out! God! Get him up! Get up. Sit him up! Help me. Help me. What? Pop it! Motherfucker, was you gonna wait for me to turn into a butterfly? Déjà vu. Would you look-a here. [CHUCKLES] Oh, I been lookin'. LYSTERINE: You know, I told him that I was coming right back. Bunz, what did you think, you were gonna spoil or somethin'? You know, I got some aluminum foil over in the cabinet too. Ooh, ooh, I don't want to hit no woman. I don't want to hit her, but I tell you right now-- When did this become Def Comedy Jam? Nikki, what is so funny? Oh, I'm sorry, baby. [MOCKING] "I'm sorry, baby." Ain't this a bitch? I ain't never had to go through this much shit just to get a piece of ass. Look, they got you slippin', now you got me slippin'. I'm outta here. You with me? I'm out. Come on. Rushon, where you goin'? I'm goin' home. It's about time you started handling your business like a man, brother. Now I still got time to make my booty call. Now, if I could-- [GRUNTS] Didn't I tell you about this blind-date stuff? Look at this shit. Let's just get a cab and get outta here. Smartest thing you said all night. Don't look back. Just keep walking. To think we almost got shot over this shit. BOTH: Shot? BUNZ: You heard him: shot. I'm outta here. Yo, cabbie! Cabbie! Wait! Rushon, are you okay? I'm still breathin', ain't I? As long as you stay away from that Glad Wrap. Lystie, come on. I'm gonna be right over here. Baby, I am so sorry. I will make it up to you. I will do anything. We can go upstairs. Damn. I just want to let you know right now, if you's thinking about trying to get in good with me, kissing me all over my fingers, you can forget about all that. Forgotten. Cool. Can I get a damn cab? Damn! What does a brother have to do to get a cab after midnight here? Rushon, you want to help me out? You say something, Bunz? Oh, I see what's goin' on. Look like you're gonna get yours before sunrise. I guess you won the bet. Ow! What bet? Bunz? Uh, could you repeat the question? You know, I got a bum ear. Baby, it's just a figure of speech, that's all. Like, "Bunz, how much do you wanna bet I'll be tapping that ass before sunrise?" That kind of figure of speech? Did you have some kind of bet goin' on? No. No. No. No, no. No, no. Hell, no. That would be degrading. Completely degrading. This is more like a little harmless challenge. Exactly. A challenge? Like between guys. You know how guys get together, talk about bitches and hos. Bunz! Baby, that's all right. I got it. It's like a guy thing, kind of like high-fivin'? Right, right. Exactly like a high five. Did you hear that? It's a guy thing. I heard. You know us girls have our thing too, except it's not a high five. It's a high one. And to you too. Lystie, let's go. Nikki, please. Rushon, you bet on me. You're gonna listen to Bunz? Nikki, Bunz is crazy. I would never do something like-- Look, I-- Would you listen to me, please? I'm listening. I fucked up. I mean, a little bit. Hey, look here. [HORN HONKS] Hey, man, I'm glad you stopped. You don't steal my car! You don't steal my car! What's up with the gun? What's up with all this violence, man? [GUN CLICKS] Oh, you done fucked up now. I oughta bust your ass right here. Sorry, I don't want to hurt you! Aah! RUSHON: Shit! BUNZ: Shit, I got to get the hell out of here, man. Shit is too crazy. I'm gonna go back to Africa, to the roots. [IMITATING AFRICAN DIALECT] Hey, let's take a bite of the Big Apple. Come on, the night is young. The only place we're going is to the hospital to get you stitched and cleaned up. After that, we're going home. This is only a flesh wound. Look. See? Ow! Back in the days, them old-school niggas could take four, five bullets to the ass, not even worry about going to the hospital. I guess shit done changed. They don't make niggers like they used to-- Rock hard. Ah, I hurt my finger. Kiss it. Nikki, I made a mistake, okay? I'm sorry. Welcome to another episode of "Slippin'-Ass Brother." Caller, you're on the line all the way from Alabama. What you think? Well, I want to know if the young buck in the back knows how to fetch and roll over too, 'cause he begs good as hell. Oh, yeah, that's right, Rushon. Straighten up for your boy. Nikki. What will it take for you to shut up? [CHUCKLES] Oh, it's funny you asked. [WOMAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY OVER P.A.] RUSHON: It was a misunderstanding. It was a bet, but it wasn't. Not now, Rushon. Like I was saying, it's a flesh wound. We want to make sure that it doesn't get infected. Like I was saying, no insurance. BUNZ: Ain't this a shame. We're in the richest country in the world. The land of the brave, home of the beautiful. And my man can't get his leg sewn up? NIKKI: Bunz, this is not the time or place. It is the place. It says here, "Emergency." I doesn't say, "Emergency, unless your broke ass ain't got no insurance card." Bunz... ALL: Shut up! Okay. Shut up. I tell you what. I'm gonna get you a parrot to go with your peg leg. Look, I got insurance. I just don't have my card on me right now. No card, no cure. Miss, I don't think you understand the severity of this situation. This man has been shot. Now, I don't know where you received your education or training from-- Lystie! I apologize for my friends. It's been a long night. I'm sure there's a procedure to verify his insurance. We filled out the forms. All the information you need is right here. Like I said, Little Miss Fugee, no card, no cure. Look, bitch! Either you make the call or I'm-a come across that desk and snatch that horsehair wig off your bald head. I will stick this clipboard so far up your-- BUNZ: Askins! Looking for Rushon Askins. Nigga, are you Rushon? Yeah, Rushon Askins, right here. Great. That's what I'm askin'. Fool, get your ass down. Okay, listen. We already pre-admitted this patient. Here's his insurance forms. We need to get him down to triage right quick, because his wounds are very severe. Yes, Dr. Zevroloski. But aren't you the guy-- Yes, I am. I'm very attracted to you. These beautiful eyes. Those cheekbones. That smile. And I love that little mustache. It's working. But do something with the Chia Pet. Listen, you and your mama are going to have to wait behind the yellow line. [SCOFFS] "Your mama"? BUNZ: Yes, your motherfuckin' mama. I know he ain't sayin' I look old. Bunz, you sure you know what you're doing? Yeah, I used to watch ER all the time, till they cut the brother's part down. Somebody died. They tried to blame it on him. Nurse, could you give me a hand. I have a patient that needs some assistance. Sure, Doctor. Could you roll him over there, please? Oh, yeah. You know, I think it's just a flesh wound. Please help me get him in the bed. Yeah, you do look a little frail. Get you right up here. Ow! There we go. Now, what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna probably get him turned around so can see him. The vital signs seem to be okay. Uh, the forehead fever is stable. [GRUNTS] Oh, oh, look here, I got to run. I got a 1-Adam-12 right down the hall. So I'm gonna leave you here with him. I'm sure you can handle this. Sure, Dr. Zevroloski? Yeah. Well, Zevroloski was my first name. You know, I'm part German, part Jamaican. Ger-maican. [IN JAMAICAN ACCENT] Wicked! Shabba! Damn Caribbean medical schools. Dr. Moore needs some help in Obstetrics. She's having a baby. Oh, well, it ain't mine. No, it's her patient. Oh. Well, let's get it on. Uh, is she naked? Aah! Ouch! Ow! [LAUGHS] It hurts good, doesn't it? Here. I'm gonna give you something for the pain. Oh. Mm-mmm. All right, it's gonna help you relax. It might even make you drowsy. But you're gonna feel a whole lot better. Oh! Nice. [CHUCKLES] Ouch! Ow! Pleasant dreams. [MOANING] So, Doctor, what seems to be the problem? Well, my residency is in Emergency Peds. I have no training in Obstetrics. This patient is multi-gravida, experiencing aggravated lateral distension with a strong likelihood of an oblique inguinal hernia impacting the peritoneum and the upper gastric artery. You ever go to Nell's on Ladies' Night? It's free before 10:00. Got a brand-new deejay there, D.J. Knockers. Girl, don't even worry about it. Let me tell you something about men. They only good for one thing, and most of the time they don't even know how to do that right. Talkin' all that mess about how big they are, how much stamina they got. Talkin' all that mess about, "Oh, whose is this? Whose is this? Whose is this?" You know what I tell 'em? "You don't even know him." Yeah, but how they gonna bet on us like we some dogs at a racetrack? 'Cause they're not human, baby. I know it may seem like it. I mean, we both eat and breathe the same. Look at a brother like Bunz. Does he act human? But you just slept with Bunz. Like I said-- BOTH: They're only good for one thing. Yes! You got it! All right. Let me tell you another thing-- Now, see, what you got to do is flip the script and keep your freaky-deaky happening on the D.L. Be like, "Yeah, that's right, but it's mine." Yeah! That's mine. Tear it up! Yeah, yeah, give it to me! Yeah, yeah, yeah! What's my name? What's my name? What's my name? Nik, we're in a hospital. A hospital. Chill. We in a hospital. All right. Okay. Tear it up. Now, the contractions are 10 seconds apart. Everything's great. Everything's fine. And, you know, you're lookin', uh-- You know, you're lookin' pretty good. What you in here for, boy? We went out... [MUMBLING] Oh, you're lucky. I got bad pipes. My balls is all congested. What're they gonna do? Un-congest them, I guess. It says here, "testicular removal." [LAUGHS] Un-congest them, my ass. They're gonna chop your balls off. What? Mr. Martin. Where are you? Mr. Martin? Where are you? [SNORING] We are ready. "Rushon." What a pretty name. Martin. Here you are. Yowch. Adios, cojones. Great evening. Got any more planned for me, Nik? Don't even start on me. You don't want me to start on you about tonight. And what is that supposed to mean? What is that supposed to mean? Nikki, we are in a freaking hospital-- Of course you don't recognize me. I'm Dr. Zevroloski. I'm in residency in Baltimore. I'm just visiting here, doing research. Hold it! Someone stole my ID. Zevroloski! Look it up. I knew it. You, come with me. We got somebody to find. I know they're in here somewhere. [HOARSELY] No. We can't-- Man, I swear to God. We oughta just leave 'em. No, we oughta find 'em and then leave 'em. No... It's okay. Look at the pretty baby. Pretty, pretty. What is wrong with you? Relax. [GRUNTS] This is a mistake. Oh, now. Everyone gets a little nervous about this procedure. It's easy. First we shave you, then we snip you, and it's over. There is life after castration. Let's get him in. [CRYING] Little baby. Little baby-- [SPITTING] Well, the plumbing works. Hey, look here. I gotta go. Where's Rushon? I don't know. You lost Rushon? No, I didn't lose Rushon. I was just in-- Look, Bunz, I don't have time for this. I'm gonna go look for him. You try to find him, please. All right. Girlfriend, keep an eye on him. All right, Mr. Martin. We've already started anesthesia. You haven't had anything to eat in the last 12 hours, right? Good. Just relax and start counting backwards from 100. [WHISPERING] Don't take my johnson. Don't take my-- All right, people, he's out cold. Let us tango. Is he in there? Thought like I looked like a mama. Hey, I like older women. You trying to say I look old? I'm sayin' you're like a fine wine. You're just aged. Check in there. Oh, snap! Chia Pet! Oh! Go! Hurry up! Yeah. Shh! Bunz, Bunz, stop. Come on. Wait a minute. All right. She's gone. Let's go. Yeah. Let's go. You probably ain't even ready for this, girl. No, you ain't ready for this. All right. Here we go. Wait a minute. Why hasn't this man been prepped? Ah, it doesn't matter. We all make mistakes. I'll do it myself. Razor. Who your daddy? Who your daddy? Who your daddy? Come on up here, girl. Mmm. Oh, oh, oh. Bunz. Bunz, wait, wait. Look. Somebody's in here. That jack-o'-lantern fool is dead to the world. Come on, let's do this. Come on. What are you doing? Come on. See? Now, come on. Hope you had your cornflakes, baby, 'cause I'm gonna go all night long, 'cause I got stamina. But you got a condom, right? No glove, no love. Hey, look. I got a glove right here. It may not be big enough to fit on this big old paloosa, but we're gonna do the best we can. There we go. Come on. Are you ready? Wait, wait a minute. Okay, wait a minute. There you go. Line it up. Okay. Oh. [PANTING] Oh. Yes. Don't go too fast, now. [YELLS] Don't you... like this? Oh, shit. [BLUBBERING] No, you didn't. I been holding that one a long time. That's just a flare, baby. [CLICKS TONGUE] MAN: Damn. My crippled ass could've rolled around in her cootchie longer than that. Damn. He's been watching us the whole time. The whole three seconds. [SNORING] [GRUNTS] I hope I didn't wear you out. Look, you need a cigarette or something to bring you down? WOMAN [OVER P.A.]: Dr. Morrissey, Dr. Morrissey. Dr. Morrissey to 875, please. Oh, my God. What are you doing? I'm removing a metastasized testicular growth. Now, if you'll excuse me. Don't touch his growth! Get her out of here. No, wait! There's been some kind of mistake! He doesn't have insurance! Fuck! Get him down to County. Goddamn, stupid Admissions. I'll be on the golf course. Son of a bitch! Hey, baby. Hi, Rushon. [CHUCKLES] My leg-- Oh, shit! Don't worry. Everything's still there, almost. Almost? What do you mean, almost? You needs to lay off the Magic Shave, man. Oh, my God, Nikki. No matter what you do, don't tell Bunz. Here we go again, worrying about what Bunz is gonna think. Lord forbid you get embarrassed in front of Bunz. That's what I'm talking about, Rushon. Hey, Nikki, you mean everything to me, but, come on, there's a place where a brother got to draw the line, now. There comes a time where a woman has got to draw the line. Nikki. Rushon, the sun's up. You already lost the bet. What else? LYSTERINE: Hurry up, Bunz. You definitely know how to do that, Quick Draw. Lystie! Hey, what's up? Yeah, that's what I've been askin'. Mind your business. Big Daddy-Haddy-Not-No. What's up, boy? Hey, what's up, man? BUNZ: You lookin' good, man. They stitched you up? Your boy here now. Don't sweat a thing. [LAUGHS] You took care of me, boy. Well, now that your boy is here, I'm sure that you'll be fine. Me and Lystie are leaving. Come on. Nikki. Forget them tricks. Let's roll. Nikki. Nikki! What do I gotta do to prove that I don't give a fuck about what Bunz thinks? Sorry, man. Is this "Kick a Brother in the Ding-Ding Day"? The proof is in the doing, not the saying, Rushon. It's getting late. We're going home. All right, fuck it! Bunz. Hey, dawg, what you doin'? I don't want to know you like this! Rushon! Hey, man, you do look younger with your beard cut off and everything. Not only am I a client, but I'm also the president. [BOTH LAUGH] Look like a popcorn shrimp, man. Is that the best you can do? You better come on, Bunz. Look like a doorstop. [VIBRATING SOUND] You gonna tell everybody we know, right, Bunz? Embarrass the hell out of me, right? I got to, man. Let me ask you something. If I pull that, would you get stronger? There you go, brother. You got a tight little ass. Ass so tight you could squeeze a piece of coal and shit a diamond. Look at you, boy. Did you see-- You really need to stop joning, Speedy. You know what? We need to keep that on the down low, because I have been going through some counseling and wanted to talk to you about that. You didn't give me a chance to reach my "climacticness," 'cause usually-- You just got excited. I got a little excited. You gonna step over to this side of the line or what? What's over there for me? I love you over here. [GRUNTS] [LAUGHS] Ah, look what they're doin'. You ready to go with me? Mm-hmm. You wanna go home? Mm-hmm. Come on and party. You with me? Mm-hmm. You sure? Watch it now. [LAUGHING] Can't touch the pork chop. Can't touch the pork chop? Whoo! Don't touch it. [LAUGHS] That really normally doesn't happen to me, but I had an accident. A cat jumped in my lap when I was watching cartoons. It scratched the left side of my shit, so on the left side I'm not functional. I gotta hit it to the right. You could learn a lot from him, you know that? I know, but I got this sports cream. You know, I put it on and I'm ready to go, you know what I'm saying? [LOUD CRASH] ♪ It's just the way You like it, baby ♪ RUSHON: Nikki, I am glad you made me wait seven weeks. Uh-huh. Now, do you think they used a razor or one of those hair removal creams on you? A razor. Mmm. You sure you know what you're doin'? Oh, yeah! Where is Killa? I'm sure Killa's around here somewhere. NIKKI: He's not even bothering us. I told you you two would hit it off and bond together. [BARKING] RUSHON: Well, you know, me and Killa have come to an understanding. I read somewhere where this is supposed to be bad for your kidneys. You know, unless you're a professional, you shouldn't be going around like this. [GASPS] Be careful. I got t-tendinitis.
