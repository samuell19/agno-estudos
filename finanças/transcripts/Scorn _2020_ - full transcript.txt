Why is it always that song? What do you mean? Whenever you get drunk, you sing... Buzzed. Whenever you get drunk, you sing the most cliched Scottish song in existence. And? It's like if I sang God Bless America every time I had one too many. I'd actually like to see that. That's not even close. Can you fetch some ice? Haven't you had enough? Well if I'm gonna be a cliched Scotsman, I might as well go all out and drink myself into a stupor, right? That does need see... In fact, while you're at it, why don't you fetch my kilt and bagpipes so we can truly do it proper? You wanna know the real reason I hate that song? Because the Colonies have never produced anything as achingly beautiful. It's about a guy who's never going to see his true love again. That makes me sad. Well it's supposed to make you sad. It's Scottish. So what did you think of the movie? I hate watching myself. Bullshit, you love watching yourself. I don't know, it was a bit more abstract than I thought it would be. The audience seemed to love it. They did, didn't they? I thought the love scene was beautiful. Yeah? You and Olivia have great chemistry. I have to say it's a little unnerving going to a party where everyone's just seen your cock on a 50-foot screen. I mean, you know, it's one thing when you're on set, you've just got a director... I know how it works, babe, I've done nude scenes before. Really, when? Stephen Truth's thesis film, my senior year. Oh, right. Yeah, that piece of shite, what was it called? Pointless Purple? Careless Turquoise. Right, Christ, what a clusterfuck. We got any olives? Check the fridge. So you were nude in Reckless Turquoise? Careless Turquoise, and yes. You sure? Which scene was it? The first one, the opening. - And you were naked in that? - Yeah. Like just topless, or the full Monty? The full Monty, you don't remember that? Christ, I barely remembered my name half the time back then. Are we out of olives? I don't know. Babe, you were clean by then. We'd been dating for... Those are onions. I know. Gonna make a Gibson. What's a Gibson? That's a martini with an onion instead of an olive. Son of a fucking... You wanna know why it's called a Gibson? So there was this investment banker named Gibson, who would take his clients out to lunch and pump the fuckers full of gin so they'd make fiscally irresponsible decisions. Meanwhile, Gibson would get the bartender to fill a martini glass with water and then put an onion in it so he could tell the differencebetween his and theirs. They'd be three sheets to the wind, coughing up cash left and right, and he'd sit there sober, sipping on his onion water. Try it? It tastes like a martini. So it does. So Stephen Truth saw you naked. You went to the premiere. You were clean by then, right? Right? Yes, yeah, I was clean. Look me in the eye and say it. Yes, Zoey, I was clean. I have been clean, relatively speaking, ever since Jenny died. That's right, I'm not supposed to mention her. Don't be ridiculous. Since she who must not be mentioned died. I never said anything like that. No, that's the thing, you don't have to. You get this look in your eye, and then you're in a funk for the rest of the day. Well how am I supposed to react when you mention her? I don't know. Neither do I, that's the fucking problem. Who you texting? I'm texting Nick. This late? He's in Vegas with some of the suits from the network. That's why he wasn't at the party tonight. Jesus. What the fuck, Zoey? We'll lose the security deposit. So, it's not your money. It's not yours either. Trust me, the old man loves being forced to spend money on me, makes him actually feel like a father. You said you quit. Do we have to fight about this tonight? This is not a fight. Sure as shit ain't fucking. Fucking? Is that what we do, Liam, we fuck? Zoey, that's not what I meant. Then have at it, go ahead, fuck me. Jesus Christ, it's an expression. You making another drink? Bingo, Sherlock. I think you've had enough. You're entitled to your opinion. Social drinking, that's what we agreed on. Trust me, that is what I'm doing. You and your insecurities are breaking the fire code in here, you know that? - Jesus. - Excuse me? You think I don't know what this is about? What is this about, Liam, educate me. You're losing your shite because I was talking to my costar at the after-party of the premiere of the film that she and I costarred in. Forgive me if I didn't realize that was a capital offense. She couldn't keep her hands off of you. She was drunk. And you were sober? I was drinking socially. You weren't fighting her off. Fighting her off, she's OliviaSt. James, for Christ sake. And? And she's won a Golden Globe, a BAFTA, been nominated for an Emmy, nominated for an Oscar, and she was on the cover of Vogue last month. If she needs a new agent, I know where to send her. All right, so you're telling me that if a drunk, I don't know, Ryan Gosling, leaned on you a bit at a party, you'd tell him to fuck off, you'd do that? Wouldn't kiss him on the cheek. You don't know that. Why, because I've neverworked with an A-lister before? That's not what I said. I don't know anything about how Hollywood works, right, because I'm just another waitress with head shots? Zoey, you starred in a pilot. Never got picked up. Well neither has mine. But it will be, and you know it. Look, Merrick will get you into his next film, and we'll all move to Beverly Fucking Hills and live happily ever after. Besides, you didn't see me shitting my knickers over the two of you at the party. I was networking. So was I. Merrick's got a great idea for his next film. Hmm. He wants to cast me as the lead. I'm sure he does. It's not like that. Bollocks, he fancies you, and you know it. They almost fired you. Showed up to the set high on your first day. I don't, I don't know what you're talking about. Merrick told me tonight. Zoey, my character was supposed to be high as a kite, all right, I was living truthfully under imaginary circumstances. Isn't that what they taught you in drama school? Substance abuse is not art. I wasn't snorting cocaine, Zoey, it was pot. There's this thing called acting, you should try it. You ever seen Easy Rider? Dennis Hopper and... Peter Fonda. Peter Fucking Fonda were bloody baked every day of that goddamn film. And that gives you an excuse? Well it gives me precedent. The only reason Lowenstein didn't fire your ass is because Merrick fought for you. Well I guess I owe him a big sloppy blowjob then, don't I? You made a promise. What promise? You promised you would never do drugs again. Drugs? Zoey, for the thousandth time, it was marijuana for Christ sake. You made a promise, and you broke it. You broke your promise, Liam. Don't ever do that again. Merrick. Hey, Zoey. Merrick, long time no see, mate. Liam, how's it going? Good. This is yours. Oh my gosh. Yeah, one of the valets found it. Do you want a drink? Oh, babe, it's late, I'm sure... Yeah, I'd love a drink, actually. Make him one of those Gilberts, babe. It's called a Gibson. Right, a Gibson. Tell him the story, babe, how it got its name. I don't think he really wants to hear... No, no, go ahead. So, there's this loan shark. It was an investment banker. Right, a banker. So this banker named Gibson would take his clients out to lunch, and ask the bartender to put an onion in his martini instead of an olive so that he could tell his drink apart from the clients'. The whole point of the story is that he would serve his clients martinis so they'd get drunk, then he would drink water from a martini glass. The onion was just so that he didn't accidentally drink the booze. How hard is it to tell drinks apart when yours is in front of you and mine is in front of me? Well it's just a story, mate, I didn't write it. - Thanks. - Manga. Tastes like a martini. That's what I said. Well we were out of olives. Am I supposed to eat the onion? Not if you're kissing anyone. Congratulations again, Merrick. The audience really did seem to love it. Did they? No seriously, I was in the parking deck. Did they like it? You didn't watch it? Why not? I couldn't, not this one. Well I should probably get... No, tell Liam about your next script. If you need to go, mate, that's. Babe, this idea is genius. Please stay, tell us about it. Well, Liam, I wanted to cast you as the male lead. Splendid, what about Zoey? She'd be the female lead, of course. Of course. Look, mate, I'm sorry, I'm fucking exhausted. What's that? That's cocaine. Holy shit, Merrick. Remember Joshua Tree? What happened at Joshua Tree? Lowenstein shook my hand after he saw the dailies, said you were the second coming of James Dean. What's going on? He didn't tell you? Easy, easy, whoa, whoa. Nobody's dying tonight. Play some music, babe. So do we use a dollar bill or what? Zoey, I'm sorry, I shouldn't have. No, let's do it. Let's do cocaine. Babe? Oh. God damn. Oh, ah. So the working title is Venus in the Brook. Is that like a Velvet Underground reference, like Venus in Furs? You a fan? Fuck yeah, mate. Favorite album? Loaded, and you? Same, the same, favorite track? Oh, Sweet Nothing, you? Same, same. What about you, you a fan of Velvet's? Ah, she hates Lou Reed. I don't hate Lou Reed, his voice is... Anyway, so the name of the project is Venus in Furs? Nope, that's the name of the song. Venus in the Brook. Right, and it takes place in a cabin in the woods. Christ, is this a fucking horror movie? No, it's not. You're getting ahead of me. Yes, it takes place in a cabin in the woods, most of it at least. But there's some backstory that you... Spielberg said you should be able to explain the plot of a film in 25 words or less. Sounds a bit reductive to me. What, you think the greatest filmmaker to walk the face of the fucking Earth is reductive? Is that what you think? You think Spielberg, Steven Spielberg, is the... Wow, okay. ET, Jurassic Park, Indiana Fucking Jones. And you're positive those are his greatest works, like 100%? Who would you say is best then, Kubrick? Well as a matter of fact I... Come on, Kubrick films are boring, okay. People just like the hard-on they give themselves when they say their favorite film is Doctor Fucking Strangelove. What do you think, Zoey? Who do you think is thegreatest filmmaker of all time? Don't smoke in here, mate. He can smoke if he wants to. To answer your question, I don't think there is a greatest filmmaker of all time. That's like saying there's the greatest food of all time, or a greatest romance. One couple's love story isn't better than another's. It might be more moving, but it's not better. You don't think you and Liam are special? I didn't say that. Well, I think our love story is the greatest one. So what's the backstory? So there's this rock star, and he's really burned out from the industry and he's sick of all the bullcrap. So he goes to this cabin in the woods to make a new album where he's free from all the distractions and whatnot. It's not a horror movie? Yeah. So he's in this cabin in like Virginia, or, yeah, Virginia, North Carolina, in the mountains and he's trying to stay clean, no booze, no drugs. While he's there, he meets this beautiful girl. Venus in the Brook? Exactly. Right, let me guess, she becomes his muse or some shite, right? Well yeah, I mean, it's a little more complicated than that, but... Of course it is. No, no, okay, what I'm saying is, prior to the film, there are three things haunting him. The death of his mother, which he missed because he was on tour, the death of his best friend from AIDS. Christ. And the fact that he abandonedthe only girl he ever loved to chase his dream of being a rock star. So, the film is about this girl helping him vanquish his inner demons in a way that both affirms life and gets the Academy to suck your cock? He's actually in a drug-induced coma the whole time. The cabin is a metaphor. You're serious? A fucking coma? Oh come on, you trying to make a student film? You gonna shoot in front of bare white walls with ugly actors and shite audio, too? Gonna cast you as the lead, so, one out of the three. Oh, I gotta take this. Talk to me, Nick. It's a good concept. Hey. Look at me. It's a good concept. Now go sit, I'll make you a real drink. Thanks. You're sure he wasn't drunk? You got it in writing? Ah, Christ Almighty, Nick, I could kiss you on the fucking mouth. Hell of a party tonight, huh? Oh for sure. Kinda wish I woulda jumped in the pool, though. Oh yeah, clothed or unclothed? Unclothed. It's been a while since I last went skinny dipping. I think I'm due. When was the last time? I appreciate that, and I appreciate you, you fucking slimy bastard. Uhhhh, so where is it filming? It was in Santa Monica, and we were bar hopping down on Main Street. And after copious amounts of alcohol and marijuana, we made our way down to the beach. Well? Got picked up. Babe, I'm so proud of you! Congratulations, man. Thanks, sodder. Gaaaaa. So, um, yeah, 12 episodes and we start shooting in September. I'll pour the shots. Christ, I can't even talk, ohhh. Filming here in town? No, Georgia, actually. Georgia? Yeah, tax incentives and all that shite. But they filmed the pilot here. Yeah, Georgia's cheaper, apparently. How long's the shoot? Uh, I don't have a schedule yet, but... Ballpark? Seven months. Thanks. Hey, to the new star of the Siren, Season One. Ahhhh, I'll take those. Merrick, I was being an ass earlier. If you do it right, your idea could have some serious potential. That's the key. On paper it's a big cliche, but the way I wanna do it, you know. Yeah, it's all about the presentation. Exactly, exactly, it's all about the presentation. Zoey? What's that? Venus in the Brook, it's a 21st-century update on Fellini's Eight and a Half? Oh, for sure. For sure. Got a script? No, no, just concepts. Hey, what if we improv some scenes? Like, right now? So my character, he's a rock star. What kind of band were you thinking? The Stones, Nirvana, one of those fucking indy bands I never watch on SNL? The Rolling Stones but younger and still relevant. Christ, they have to be English? Scottish is fine. Is the character supposed to be Scottish, or are you just saying that to make me happy? He's supposed to be Scottish. Right, he's supposed to be Scottish, and you're an arse kisser. Babe. What kinda instrument does he play? Does it matter? I don't know, Merrick, does it matter what kind of instrument your protagonist plays? He plays piano, guitar, drums, but he just sings in the band. A singer? Have you heard me sing? We'll dub you over, Liam. Yeah, or you'll just steal my ideas and cast some Broadway fucker who can hit a high C or some shite. I would never dream of doing that Liam because you're such a joy to work with. So what's the name of the band? Band? My band, what's it called. I don't know, I haven't even written a treatment. Cellar Doors. Here we go. If I had a band, I always said I would call it Cellar Doors. Isn't that similar to just the Doors? Thank you, that's what I've always said. Cellar Door is the most beautiful phrase in the English language. You're a pretentious filmmaker, haven't you seen Donnie Darko? I hate that movie. Bollocks. You just like saying you hate Donnie Darko because you're afraid of people labeling you. At least they've heard of me. Oh, have they? Zoey, just off the top of your head, what was the film that won the Palme D'or at Cannes last year. It's pronounced Can. Whatever, what was it called? I don't know. Your point? Nobody gives a flying fuck about artsy movies. What, like the one that we just did? You know what I mean. You know what, I could throw this bottle out the window and hit 50 waiters who are just as talented as you and who would sell their left testicle to act in an artsy movie nobody gives a flying fuck about. Now do you wanna run the scene or not? It's up to you. So I'm a Scottish frontman of a band similar to the Rolling Stones called the Cellar Doors. Sure. You picturing Jagger, flamboyant and shite. We're just playing around, man, do you really need to know? Yes, I do really need to know this information. I don't question your process, so don't question mine. Are you picturing Jagger, Freddie Mercury, Johnny Rotten? If you must know, Kurt Cobain. I asked you if you were thinking Nirvana, and you said the Stones. I want your character to be tortured, sensitive, you know? People think of Mick Jagger doing drugs, they think those were the good old days. When they think of Cobain doing drugs, they think, what a shame. Yeah, yeah, exactly. He's idolized and pitied at the same time. So I'm at this cabin in the woods to get away from all the excess and shite, and I'm walking through the woods and I come across this girl? Yes. Anything else I should know before we begin? Your favorite color is green, Chinese food gives you heartburn sometimes and your first pet is a hamster named Colonel Whiskers, should I keep going? Fuck you. What about you, do you need anything? No, I'm good. So is she bathing in a stream? Is she naked? Yeah. Should I step around the corner? Action. Christ. Zoey? Sorry, I was just on a walk and I heard someone singing. Do you know that song? I'm sorry. The Bonnie Banks of Loch Lomond, do you know it? Your mother used to sing it to you. Yes, I do. What are you doing? Don't let her get away, the scene's not over. Yes it is. Did she have to be naked? I made that choice. You can't just get naked like that without telling me. I'm not allowed to get naked, but when you decide to do it, it's no big deal? What the fuck are you talking about? I don't know, Liam, what could I possibly be referring to? Is this about Olivia? Bingo, Sherlock. I told you about that scene the second, the fucking second I got the script. You didn't tell me it was gonna be nude until after you shot it. That's because we didn't decide to go nude until the last second. Really? Yes. Merrick? Yeah? The scene in the moviewhere Liam and Oliva fucked. Yeah? Liam says you guys didn't make the call to go full nude until right before you shot it, is that true? He's right. Lowenstein stepped in at the last second, said he figured Olivia St. James nude would generate a lotta buzz. I need to use the bathroom. - It's that way. - I know where it is. So what did you think of the scene? How'd you two meet? I told you the story. Tell me again. We're doing a meet cute scene. You really wanna go through that again? Well I was studying theater at NYU. Some of my friends took me to this off-, off-, way the fuck off-Broadway production of the Glass Menagerie. And Liam played Tom. And his performance, I stuck around to meet him after the show, and he was gracious and charming. And then his girlfriend at the time showed up. What was her name again, Liam? Jenny. Jenny Waltmire. One of Zoey's friends that brought her was making his thesis film. He had already cast Zoey, and he convinced me to read the script. Next thing you know, Zoey and I are playing lovers in a shitty student film. It wasn't shitty. It was three people sitting in a room talking. It wasn't shitty. So what happened to Jenny? What about you, Merrick, you ever been in love? I'm not the one doing the scene. I fucking hate writers who write about love and shite and have never experience that. Didn't seem to matter for Drinking With the Pope. Well maybe I'm growing as an actor. I've been in love. Oh yeah, what's the story? There is no story, she was in love with someone else and we never got together. I don't think that counts. Then don't act in my fucking movies. So who was this girl? We went to high school together in Minnesota. She's married now, and has two kids, two girls. What's her name? Jenny. My turn. Mind if I grab some water? There is a drought, mate. I know I said it at the party, man, but seriously, you did a great job. Thank you. I just wish I coulda gotten Zoey on it, you know? Wrote the role for her. You and Olivia were great, though. Your chemistry was, it was phenomenal. Thanks. It's like you two were actually sleeping together. That second night in Joshua Tree. What the fuck are you doing here tonight? That second night in Joshua Tree, all I saw was the hotel room you went into after wrap. - Did you? - Yeah. And what does that prove? Not a damn thing. That's right. You were probably just running lines. We were probably just running lines. That's all I have are my theories. You're goddamn right. And conversations. Conversations with who? With whom. Conversations with whom? What do you say, Zoey, wanna run the scene again? Sounds good to me, what do you think, Babe? I'm starting to fade. Why don't you give him some more coke? No, no, if he's tired, he can go ahead and crash. It's his house. Mind if I keep running with Zoey? You know what, I think I'm good for another round. Now I've got a few notes. Excuse me. Excuse me. I liked how you shamelessly let him see you naked, but on this one, let's switch it up. Don't let him see you naked, okay? Okay. I liked your singing too, but let's, uh, let's do something different. I want you to talk to yourself. Remember, your character's a figment of his imagination, so what would his character be talking to himself about? Do you think something... Don't, don't tell me, just do it. Okay. And let's keep your actual clothes on this time. Thank you. Got it. And for me? Yeah, uh, do your number. Anything else? Do you need anything else? Okay, are we set? Fucking set. All right, you know what, let's, let's do this one in the living room. Action. You've got to stop beating yourself up over it. I know, I know. Well, no, I don't think you do. That was a shitty thing to do. I had to, you had to do it. Did I? Absolutely. Why? You know why? He was holding you back. Don't look at me, don't look. I'm sorry. What are you doing here? You were spying on me. No I wasn't. Don't come any closer. I was not spying on you. I was on a walk, and I heard someone talking, that's it. What's your name? Why do you wanna know? Not every day you come across a beautiful woman bathing naked in a stream. Oh I get it. You wanna fuck me. What, no. That's what you wanna do, right, admit it. You wanna fuck me. Don't look at me, answer her. Okay, the thought crossed my mind. I'll bet it did. So what's your name? If I was ugly, would you wanna know my name? If I was fat and old, wrinkled, missing my teeth, would you wanna know my name? I, I just asked what your name was? If you didn't wanna fuck me, would you want to know my name? Fine, I wanna know your name because I wanna sleep with you. That's not what I asked. I asked if you didn't wanna fuck me, would you wanna know my name? What do you want me to say? How about the truth? Christ, why is this such a big deal? You meet a new person, you ask them their name. Answer the question. Fine. If I didn't wanna fuck you, I wouldn't give a shit about you. Is that what you want me to say? Only if you mean it. And cut. How was that? Fascinating. You can say that again. Sure as shite commit to that choice, Christ. Commitment always impresses me. Thank you. But I think it blinds you sometimes. Because you're so ferociously committed to your choice that it keeps you from seeing the potential in the scene and letting that potential develop. At the beginning, while you were talking to yourself, you mentioned someone holding you back. Let's explore that. What, right now? Why not? Let's take it from, from were you spying on me? Liam, you had your back turned to her. Action. You were spying on me. I wasn't spying. I promise, I was just on a walkand I heard someone talking. What's your name? Why do you want to know? Jerry, my name's Jerry. What's yours? Lola. Like the Kinks song. Never mind. It's nice to meet you, Lola. Likewise, Jerry. Ask her what she was talking about. - What were you talking about? - Subtly, asshole. Who were you talking to? I was talking to myself, I do that sometimes. No judgment here. That's the only way to have an intelligent conversation these days. You probably think I'm crazy. Aren't we all? Guess we are. Who was holding her back, keep pushing. Um, you should hear some of the conversations I have with myself. Oh yeah, what do you guys talk about? You know, politics, the weather. No, I tend to beat myself up, about the stupid shite I've done. I guess we have that in common. Don't let him in, Lola. Have you ever abandoned someone? Sorry? Have you ever abandoned someone who loved you, someone who would have given anything, done anything just to make you happy? I'm a little fuzzy on the backstory. Did he abandon someone? You tell me, Liam. Christ sake, man, how many times do I have to tell you? Do not use my name when you're directing me. Did he abandon someone, Jerry? Why do you ask, Lola? Why don't you answer? Don't know, it's a strange question, I guess. Guilty eyes. What? You have guilty eyes, that's why I asked. Tell her, tell her, tell her the truth. Okay, I abandoned someone who loved me. Why? Why did you do it? Tell her, tell her why. Because she was holding me back. That's not good enough, Lola. How was she holding you back? She just was. Still not good enough. What was she holding you back from? I don't know. She just was. Tell her the truth. What was she holding you back from? What was she holding you back from? He's running away, Lola. What was she holding you back from? Punish her, Liam, destroy her. What was she holding you back from? From everything, okay! She was a goddamn cinder block dragging me. No, you know what, she was a noose, a fucking noose around my neck. And I couldn't breathe without her insecurities choking me! And you know what? The day I left her was the best goddamn day of my life. Did you love her? No. Cut. That was great, you guys. How is this helping? I feel like we're chasing rabbits or some shite. You okay? Oh, Christ. I'm fine. How'd you feel about that one? It was okay. Do you feel like we're chasing rabbits or some shite? What are you trying to say with this piece? Why do you need to tell the story? Maybe I just wanna show off. That's a shitty reason to make a movie. Well I coulda said money. Yeah, but this won't make any money. It could. Maybe if you cast Olivia St. James. You know that wasn't my call, right? Of course, that was the Evil Empire. Exactly. The same Evil Empire that apparently wiped their asses with Olivia's contract at the last second and made her go nude. She was always going to be naked. Liam just didn't have the balls to tell me upfront. I know that shit doesn't fly, not on union sets at least. Zoey, I wrote that role for you. She's gonna win an Oscar for it. But you're better than she is. Then why the fuck am I waiting tables? Zoey, it's just a matter of time. My agency dropped me. Did you know that? Yeah. You did? Liam told me. What else has he told you? I wish I knew, that accent of his, you know. So that night on my birthday when I went skinny dipping in the Pacific, I'd gotten kicked out of a bar. I was in the bathroom and I, I started slamming the door, over and over and over again. But one of the bouncers heard me, caught me. Kicked me outta the bar. I went peacefully, I even asked him what his name was. Look, Merrick, it's been a blast and a half, but I am fucking exhausted. I think it's time. You were saying? I think you should leave. I think you should do another line. No thanks. I'm offering you free drugs, man. You realize how much this stuff costs? If you'd like make a donation, I accept cash or traveler's check. Come on, I feel like we'reon the verge of a breakthrough. Yeah? What kind of a breakthrough? Look, I'm tired. Zoey has to work in less than 12 hours. Jesus. Ohhh, phewwww. I feel like we're on the verge of a breakthrough. Ahhh. Fuck me. You never finished the story of how you two got together. Christ, we have to go through this again? I need to hear it again, man, just trust me. So I was dating someone else when I met Zoey. Jenny Waltmire. Yes. How serious was it? I was 20 years old, how serious could it be? My parents go married at 18, so. That's because you're fucking Amish. Mennonite. Tomahto, tomato. It was pretty serious. It was as serious as it coulda been at that age, okay? We'll put it that way. Fair enough. Jenny and I were, um... Heroin addicts. Oh Christ. Her father back in Arkansas, he had been. She needed an escape. Even though he was 1,000 miles away, she needed an escape. So we started experimenting. Five months later, she overdosed. Zoey was there for me during the grieving process. Let's do another scene. The one where she leaves him. And why'd she do that? Oh, well, guess we'll find out, won't we? I want you to enter the room like you did before, and you're gonna find herpacking her bags with, with me. So you're gonna be a part of the scene? Why not? Why not, do you have any questions before we start? Guess I'm set. What about you, any questions? Did you take my wallet outta my purse? Who the fuck is this? Jerry, what are you doing here? You've got five fuckingseconds to tell me who the fuck this is before I rip his goddamn face off. I'm Richard. Dick? Richard. Tell me, Dicky, you sleeping with her? No. Right, and I'm the Prince of Fucking Wales. What you do with marine mammals is your own business. Oh, look at the wise-ass on Dick here. Tell me, you got any good knock-knock jokes? Let's get outta here. So that's it? You're just gonna run off into the May fucking sunset with Dicky here? Yes she is. Didn't ask you, Fuckface. Lola? Fuck you. What am I to you, some sort of prize? You think if you can just shoot straighter than the guy next to you, you get to take me off the shelf and carry me around the fucking midway? No, no! Fuck you! When you look at me, you think how does she fit into my dreams, how does she jibe with my 10-year plan? Well you know what? I am not an afterthought. I am not fucking building blocks. Zoey! I don't wanna be a part of your dream. I wanna build ours together, can't you fucking see that? Hey! Relax, man, I'm just part of the scene. Is that what it was? You looked a fuck of a lot like you were putting your tongue in my girlfriend's mouth. I was living in the moment. Jesus, Merrick, you can't do that to someone without warning them first. You can't just run up onsomeone and kiss them like that. Oh, oh, didn't seem to stop you in rehearsal. What's he talking about? He didn't tell you about his first rehearsal with Olivia? We're doing the coffee shop scene. You know, the one where he leans over the table and kisses her. I know the scene. Well it wasn't in the original script. So the first time we read it through, he calls an audible, kisses her right in the middle of the scene. And it was the best goddamn moment in your whole shitty movie. Dude, I've had enough of your disrespect of my work. And I've had enough of you being in my house. Your house? We all know who pays for this place. And? Name one thing in your life that wasn't handed to you. Patience for your bullshit. I worked hard for that, believe you me. And it's not like you're some sort of working-class hero. You got here because you won a fucking reality show. Look, I worked my ass off to get to where I am. Christ, it must be hard to sit down. You're scared. Am I? Yeah, you're scared that someday everyone's gonna figure out that you don't deserve to be here. Wow, project much, Mr. MTV? I've already proven myself. And I haven't? You tell me. No, I haven't, and neither have you. You know why? Because it's fucking impossible. Nobody deserves to be here, because here, fucking Hollywood, doesn't deserve to exist. What the hell are you talking about? This is why I hate, why I despise pretentious fucks like you. You think you're changing the world or something, fucking transcending or some shite. When all you're doing, all we're doing is distracting people for two hours of their lives at a time, that's it! That's all this is, Merrick! We're not curing fucking cancer! And speaking of where we should and shouldn't be, why the fuck are you in my house? Take a wild guess. Fuck my girlfriend? You bet your plaid ass, I am. Ah. Floor's all yours, Romeo. So the bouncer leads me outside, I go peacefully. What the fuck are you talking about? Shut the fuck up, Liam. I said I'd go peacefully. Even asked the bouncer what his name was, but he wouldn't tell me. He was just doing his job, you know. Can't fault him for that. So I'm outside the bar. Friends are inside, can't get back in. My head's full of pot and booze and it's my fucking birthday. I was slamming the stall door because you weren't there. And not just that you weren't there, you had plans, I understood it. But even if you had been, I knew I couldn't have had you. So I'm outside. My friends haven't realized that I've been kicked out yet. I go to light a cigarette and I remembered I have this. So I get an idea. And I start walking down to the beach. You know, I thought, what a poetic way to go, right? Sitting in the sand beside the pier. Now that I'm 27 I could join the club. So I get about a block. My friends find me. I plastered on a smile and I went on like nothing ever happened. I love you, Zoey. I have ever seen you smiled at me in line at that coffee shop. Thank you, Merrick. But I love Liam. I always have, and I always will. He doesn't love you. Yes he does. He's fucking Olivia St. James. Has been this whole time. I know. Liam made a mistake. I forgive him. I think we've made some great progress on the script tonight. Let's get coffee soon and talk about it, okay? I think it's gonna be your best yet. Goodnight, Merrick. Get some rest. Zoey, I can explain. There's nothing to explain. It's in the past. No, Zoey, that's the thing. I'm sorry I threw those glasses. I shouldn't have broken them. I, I don't give a fuck about the glasses, so what? I wasn't acting. I don't wanna be an afterthoughtin your plans, okay? From now on, you and I are in this together, equally. It's not your dream. It's not my dream. It's our dream. There's not gonna be a from now on. That's what I'm trying to say. Fuck. I wanna be with Olivia. I need to clean up the glass. Are you even listening to me, Zoey? I don't wanna be with you anymore. I want to be with Olivia. Liam? Liam, honey? Liam. Honey, look. Liam, honey, listen to me very carefully. What did you have to drink tonight at the party? What? What did you have to drink? What was your drink? Gin and tonic, gin and tonic. Shit. Oh Christ. This wasn't supposed to happen. Baby, I swear this wasn't supposed to happen. What the fuck did you do? To happen like this. Olivia didn't deserve you. Neither did Jenny Waltmire. Jenny? She was destroying you. Oh God. You killed Jenny? Oh my God. You and I belong together. Forever.
