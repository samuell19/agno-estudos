Hey, hey, it's okay. Shh... Listen, everything's gonna be okay, all right? Some folks say, life is an open book. You're born, you live, you die, and not much changes in between. Me, I've had a front row seat of human nature long enough to know that sin corrupts. And that species of sin known as greed corrupts absolutely. Some people just like rolling the dice. And if you get snake eyes, well, you just deal with it. That's life in Mississippi anyway. Even the Magnolia State. What goes down in the heat of passion, or just plain stupidity, can haunt a body forever. No matter where you go. Some things just have a way of sticking to your soul... and staining it for eternity. Hell is real, my friends. It was prepared for the devil and his angels, but sinners who follow after the devil's wicked ways will be thrown into the unquenchable lake of fire. For sinners, they're not covered in the blood of Jesus. Be aware, God is not... You can't go around drinkin', gamblin', stealin' killin', whorin' around and think God'll just turn a blind eye to it all. Friend, you need to repent. You need to accept Jesus and let him pay the price for your sins. What will you choose: heaven or hell? Don't be fooled, God is comin', death is comin'. It's coming for us all. It's right around the corner for some of you. And where will you be when it finds you? Where will you be the minute you wake up dead? Thank you. - I ordered you pancakes. - To go I hope. Oh... Is this true? You know, you need to take it easy, Cecil. Tell me the paper got it wrong. Generally, the Gazette is right. Well, I see that you gentlemen have lots to talk about. I'll see you at the office. Excuse me. How? You said it was a done deal. A sure thing. Okay, Cecil, sometimes it doesn't go as planned, all right. - I want my money back. - Cecil, that's not possible. - Okay? - I want it back! You know, I didn't hear you complaining when I made you a bundle of cash on that tech stock a few months ago. No, but then you made Roland sound so good, I put in all I had to buy it. That's your decision, Cecil, not mine. So, that's it? I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do. Oh, there's nothing you can do? But there's something I can do. You just wait. What's deserving's coming for you. - Coffee, Russ? - Yes, please. - Mm. - This ain't over. Not even close. Ma'am. - Thanks for saving me. - Huh. Yeah. What's got his dander up? There were a couple of companies that were supposed to merge, and if they did the stock would've skyrocketed and... - And they didn't? - No, ma'am, they didn't. Hm. And you persuaded him to buy some Unfortunately, a lot of people, yeah. I wouldn't want to be you today. Well, why don't you come over for supper tonight? I'm making beef stew for me and Daddy, and I expect you might want a little company. You would expect to be right. You know, I won't forget, I never forget. And he will call you back. We both know you, it's fine. Yes. You can... Oh, hold on. Phone won't stop ringing. Got more than a dozen messages here so far. Well, I guess I'm the town pariah, Pernie. Seems so. - You got a visitor. - Hm? The sheriff. Oh, shit. What do I owe the pleasure? I told my brother to be careful about investing. He wanted to build himself a nest egg. Retire. He trusted you. Little Russ Potter. Gone off to the big city and made some money. Or so they say. Now he's coming back to share his Midas touch. My brother taught you in eighth grade, I believe. Yep. He was a good man. He is a good man. But he's a lot poorer today than he was yesterday. Now I'm not blaming you for all of it. He chose to roll the dice, nobody made him do it. But he was led to believe that the odds were more in his favor than they were. - I gave your brother... - Really? ...and all the investors, the most up to date information that's available to me. You understand that? So much for the Midas touch. All right, what are you accusing me of? If I'm not accusing you of anything. Yeah, well, shit, you could fooled me. - Fooling? - Yeah. Now, there's a word I bet you know a thing or two about. You might want to get that. I imagine there are a lot of people around town that want to talk to you. And, Russ, I wouldn't go jaywalking, or speeding at 26 or 27 miles an hour through a 25 zone. There's been a little uptick in crime. We're trying to control it. You understand? This is Russ Potter. Where will you be the minute you wake up dead? Excuse me? What the hell? Hello? Where will you be the minute you wake up dead? Who is this, and how'd you get my number? That ain't an answer. Who the hell is this? You'll soon find out. - You okay? - Yes, I, just zoned out for a second. Yeah. Happens to me all the time. Hey, Delaine said you're coming up for supper tonight? Yeah, yeah. Yes, sir. See you at 6:30. That is delicious beef stew. Compliments to the chef. Nobody makes it like Delaine. Well, I can't take the credit. I did get the recipe from the diner. You did the cooking though. Well, I appreciate you all having me. Uh, Delaine tells me you had a rough day today. Yeah, you could say that. Oh, yeah. Cecil Hammett threatened him. Cecil's an idiot. - Well... - But he gets it natural. His old man was probably the dumbest person I ever met. It's a wonder Cecil's as bright as he is. - It was still scary. - Mm. I hope other folks took the news better. You know, a lot of people don't know this, but, you know, I lost a lot of money, as well. You know, I'm hurtin' just like, uh, you know, everybody. Maybe even more. And you're sure Cecil's not a threat? No way. No. But, I mean... But? So, I got a, uh, call today, sort of threatening. - I guess. - Sort of? Hm. I got a call from a fellow and he asked me, "Where will you be the minute you wake up dead?" - That's eerie. - Mm. You call the law? No. Well, why not? Well, I just felt like he's trying to rattle me. You know? Russ... Don't mess around with this. You should call them. Delaine's right. You can't be too careful nowadays, people are crazy. Maybe the police can trace the call. No, I don't think so, I mean, it came up as an unknown caller. You gotta call the sheriff. Anyways, I don't wanna take up any more your time. I appreciate the dinner. Thanks again. Uh, hey, let me walk you home. - Oh, yeah? Okay. - Yeah. I-I thought I'd be just honest with you... The stew had just a little too much salt in it for me. Nice. Listen, I wanna thank you for supper. - Oh. - It was delicious. Any time. You feel like, uh, coming in? I'd love to. Come on in. Thank you. - Can I interest you in beer? - Yeah, sure. - I could go for one. - Nice. Yeah, I got them in the garage. Let me go grab 'em. Oh, it's just Pernie. Hey, Pernie, what's up? Sorry to bother, Russ, Horace's medical report came back. - Yeah? - Not looking good for the poor fella. - Okay. - Is it okay if I stay with Horace for a bit? Pernie, listen, just take as much time as you want. - All right? - Sure. If you want to take two, three days off, that's totally fine. Okay? I just hate to leave you right now. No, I want you just to relax. - You sure? - Yep. Pernie, just take care of Horace. All right? Thank you, Russ. - Okay. - Thank you, thank you. I'm sorry, honey. Good night. I so appreciate it. Bye. Everything all right? Pernie's, uh, afraid her husband's cancer came back. Oh. Well, speaking of which, how's your dad doing? Mm. He's fine. - Yeah? - Yeah. Been cancer free for about a year now. You know, I-I wanted to ask him, but I just kind of felt odd about it. You can ask him, he don't mind. There's something that I'm curious about. What's that? Why haven't you been married? So you feel odd asking about my daddy's health, but you're just fine asking my love life? Uh, well, uh, hm... Let's just say the pickens in Bare Hollow are kinda slim, if you hadn't noticed. So why have you stayed? Daddy, mostly. Besides, I've been here my whole life. I don't know where I'm go or what I'd do when I got there. Hm. You know, I'm gonna tell you something... I've had a crush on you since high school. - You never let on. - Mm-mm. How come? Well, I mean, you know, you were kinda part of the popular crew and I just... shit, I didn't think you were that interested in me. So... would that be the reason that you rented this house? No, no, no, no, no. So-so the price was right, obviously. - Mm-hm. - As you know, and then, you know, I thought, well, you know... It ain't so bad to be next to the prettiest girl in town. Hm. - All right. - You don't... - Yeah? - Where will you be the minute you wake up dead? Hey, I want you to listen to me. Fuck you. You hear me? You'll find out. Son of a bitch. Wait... - Wait, was that the caller? - Yeah. Okay, Russ, you gotta promise me that you'll see Sheriff Fowler in the morning. I promise. - Okay. - Yeah. You got any plans this weekend? I might. What's going on Tillman? Hey, good morning, Russ. - Thurmond in? - Yep. Thank you. Yeah. May I? Yeah. Well, I've been getting some threatening phone calls I wanted to talk to you about. Threatening phone calls. Shocking. From? Well, I don't know. From more than one person? I mean, it seems like the same person How old? Well, if I had to guess, I'd probably say he's younger than older. How many calls? Three so far. So, what exactly did he say to you? Where will you be the minute you wake up dead? That's it? What do you mean, that's it? Yeah, that's it. - You get a number? - No, it's coming from an unknown number. Eh, it's likely somebody upset with you over the merger. Or the, uh... non-merger. I wouldn't worry too much about it. - Hm. - I mean, if he wanted to kill you, you'd be dead by now. You know what, Sheriff, that's-that's really comforting. But what happens if the calls continue? - What do you do? - Ah. They'll probably get tired of it when they find out that they can't get you flustered. So that's it? All I can do. - Yeah. - For now. You're right. - Mm. - There you go. Thank you. So, did you go? To the sheriff? Yeah, I went. And? Delaine, he don't give a shit. Come on, now. Well, that's the last time I'm gonna vote for him. Well, what are you gonna do? I don't know, I mean, I'll probably just ignore the calls. - Hm. - More importantly though, last night was perfect. I know. I would love to hit the rewind switch, if you know what I mean. Mm-hm. Well, I'm working the supper shift tonight, but, uh, tomorrow night? Nah, I can't do it tomorrow, I'm busy. You ain't got no plans, nobody likes you right now. All right, I'll be there. - All right, then. - Mm-hm. This is Russ Potter here. Where will you be the minute you wake up dead? Listen to me, if you're trying to scare me, it's not working. You hear me? It's not working. Go! Delaine, honey. I'm sorry. I just heard, I'm sorry. I don't understand it. Who'd wanna kill Daddy? Okay, let's go inside. Come on. I know this is difficult, but I have to ask some questions. When did you find your daddy? Uh, after I come home from the breakfast shift at the diner. What time was that? Around ten o'clock. Thurmond, can't this wait? No. No, it cannot. According to the coroner, Carl was killed sometime before midnight. When did you last see him? Uh, just before I left for the supper shift. Did your daddy have any enemies? Anybody he had recently had a quarrel or... a disagreement with? - No. - Did he owe money to anybody? No. Anything missing? Not that I know of. Don't understand. Somebody wanted your father dead. - Thurmond. - What? What if Carl wasn't the target? What do you mean? Well, I've been telling you that I've been getting threatening phone calls, right? So? Well, maybe I was the target. - You? How? - Yeah. I mean, it could've been wrong. Shit, I live right next door. - Wrong house? - Mm-hm. Well, I suppose it's possible, but I would think that anybody who wanted to kill you would know where you live. It's a small town. Who lost the most? I mean, I don't know that off hand, I would have to check but... I mean, people lost... thousands and thousands of dollars. Might be. I heard of it happening a few years back down in Jones County. A man hired a hit man to kill his wife's lover, but gave him the wrong address. Wound up splitting the throat of a local preacher. - It's all your fault, Thurmond. - Hm? If you had just listened to Russ when he come you, my daddy might not be dead. Come on, now. We don't know what happened. Let's not go pointing fingers just yet. Russ, I'm gonna need the names, phone numbers and addresses of all the people who lost money. I'll get it to you tomorrow morning. Ah, it's gonna take some time. Ah, again, I'm-I'm sorry for your loss. But we'll find out who did this. I promise you. Yeah, well, I hold you to that. Please do. I'll get back to you when I know more. Delaine. Mm. Hey, what can I do for you? Can I just stay with you for a while? Of course. 'Cause I can't stand the thought of being here with Dad gone. Of course. Stay as long as you want. Hey, come here. Can't believe somebody's so mad at you, they'd want to kill you. Mm-hm. Well, it can be a wicked world, can't it? Hm. Are you still religious? No. Why not? I've rode the-the devil's back way too many times. I might burn up if I walk into a church at this point. Is that why you come home? Yeah. I mean, I needed to plug in. I mean, why not here at home? Hm. You're still going to church. My mama was strict about it, but... after she died from taking ammonia we never went back. - Hm. - Daddy blamed God for taking her from him. Just... couldn't forgive Him. You know what I've never understood about religion? What? Well, are we sinners because we sin, or do we sin because we're born sinners? And if it's the latter, then what right does God have to judge us? Hm? If you ever figure it out, let me know. I got all the information that you asked for: names, addresses, phone numbers, and exactly what they invested. - Thanks. - Yeah. I'm sorry for not taking you more seriously about these phone calls. Mm. You got anymore? No, no, not since Carl was killed. You really think it's the wrong house? And you knew Carl pretty well, didn't you? No, I mean, I moved in two months ago and met him there. Ever see any suspicious people over? No. I mean, he didn't seem like the kinda person that got in trouble. I mean, if you ask me, he was a gentle soul. So, wrong house is still the best theory then. Yeah. Let me know if you need anything else. Uh, Russ. Be careful. Any of this theory is correct, this guy may not be done. - Hey. - Hey. What are you doing? I'm, uh, getting rid of some of Daddy's things. I thought you weren't ready to go back in the house yet. I'm not, really. Just didn't want to put it off for too long. What about these? Where do you want 'em? You can set him right there. I'll get him in a sec. Thanks. - Who's that Delaine? - That's Lucius. You might have seen him work in the kitchen at the diner. No, no. Well, I thought he could use a little extra money, so I asked him to help me pack up the house. So you're moving, huh? That's it. Yeah. Yeah, I'm gonna sell it. I can't live here no more after what happened. - You understand. - Of course, yeah. Just, uh... seems a bit sudden is all. I know. It's not like I'm-I'm moving today or tomorrow. Right. Yeah, all right. Well, shit, let me know if you need anything. - Ru... Hey, Russ. - I think I may have lost one of my gold hoop earrings at your house, so if you come across it, let me know. Daddy gave them to me, so... All right, will do. Hey. You shouldn't have come out when he was there, he might have recognized your voice. I didn't know he was there until I stepped out. Hey, you said he wouldn't be home. He wasn't supposed to be. Well, now my fault then. - When do I get my money? - Soon enough. - Well, when? - When the check comes in. We have been through this. Relax. Yeah, easy for you to say. I owe people money. I told you that. And they won't wait, so I can't wait. It's just a few more days. Hey. Hm. Money will be here any day now. You'll see. - Well, it better be. - Mm-hm. Shit! I found your earring. Where on Earth did you find it? Under the couch. Soon as you walk in. - Thank you. - Yeah. I gotta get back to the office. I'll see you soon. Okay. Bye. Did you threaten Russ Potter? Well... Well, what? Sorta, yeah. But not really. Well, which is it? You did, or you didn't? Well, I did. But-but I didn't mean it. I mean, I-I meant it at the time but-but not now. I wouldn't hurt nobody. How much did you invest? Oh, well, I... I'd rather not say. Ten-thousand sound about right? Oh, gosh all mighty, darn. If you knew then why'd you ask? Awful lot of money to lose. You sure you didn't mean it? No. Oh, no. Like I said, I meant it at the time. I was mad. Hell, I was more than mad. I wanted to hurt him. - But now... - Now what? I decided to forgive Russ. It's the Christian thing to do. - Let me ask you a question. - Shoot. Where will you be the minute to wake up dead? Pardon? Where will you be, the minute you wake up dead? I don't understand. No, I don't think you do, Cecil. All right. You can go. What kind of question is that? I said you can go, Cecil. Bye. Fine. You ask crazy questions. I'll just carry my ass outta here. And the insurance company you wanted, it's on line one. Evening, Lucius. - Look, I know I'm behind. - Yeah, you're way behind. But I'm about to come into a lot of money. - You know, I just need... - I just need you to give me my money. Look, and you're gonna get it. But that's what you said last week. Oh, but I did a job. It's gonna pay everything. What kind of job did you do, that's gonna pay you 5k? I killed a man. - You killed a man? - Yeah. Who'd you kill, Lucius? Carl Moore. Oh, anyhow. Yeah, I work with his daughter Delaine at the diner. And she wanted him killed to collect a shit load of insurance money. - So, I just need... - I just need! I mean, there you go again with the I just needs. And so what I need you to know, is I just need my motherfucking money. Just a couple more days. Just a couple more days. Couple more days! Just a couple more days! You sound like a 12-year-old child! - I swear! - Oh, you swear, huh? Really shouldn't swear. Says so in the bible. You know what else is in the bible? He who beareth false witness, that man shall perish. Yeah, faith in youth. Mace. Hey... Jody! - There's no need! - Mace! What are you doing? Man's a fry cook. He needs his hands to make a living! Use your brain! How's he supposed to pay us, if he ain't got no hands? Take off your shoe. Take off your shoe. - Jody, please. - Take off your shoe and your goddamn sock. Take off your shoe! Jody, no, please! Come on, now! Guys, we're all friends here! Oh... Stay still. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, not the pinky toe. Pink toe's important. Next to the big toe it's probably the most important. You need it for balance. Now that third and fourth toe, they ain't so important. Well, which one? Three or four? You know what, I'm feeling sporting. Why don't you pick, Lucius. What? No, no, I can't pick. Well, you're gonna pick, or we're gonna take them both. Fourth. Why'd you pick four? It's smaller. So it is. Don't do this. Oh, my toe! Ah, you gonna give me my money by tomorrow. Or you're gonna have matching feet. ...took my toe! Look, I ain't foolin'! I just got my toe cut off! - What? - With a bolt cutter! Now give me some damn money! Okay. Okay. I'll get you some money. Okay? Okay, here, here. Now that's all I got. What is this? One... three... 20... 40... Sixty-three dollars! I told you, that's all I got. Tips were short tonight. Well, then go to an ATM. I don't got nothing in the bank. Oh, you owe me five grand. And you'll get it. I'm broke, too. Why do you think I'm doing all this, huh? I need the money just as bad as you do. I doubt that! You still got all your toes. Now, you need to give me some serious money or I'll... Or you'll what? Hm? You're the murderer here. Well, I'll do you what I did to your daddy. Oh, are you threatening me? Now, how would you get your money then, genius? Soon! What can you tell me about Lucius McFalls? Your cook. Well, he seems like a decent enough guy. Good cook. Well, not great but good enough. He gets a little hot-headed every now and then, but other than that I got no complaints. Is he in trouble? Not sure yet. What about Delaine? She cause you any trouble? She is a good waitress. Real personable, people like her, especially with men... ...she's a little flirty. But she's a hard worker. She been doing a lot of extra shifts lately. Why? Because she owes me some money. Why? Oh, come on, Thurmond. You know, I don't like to speak ill of the dead, but her and her old man, they... they liked to gamble, mostly on the internet, I think. She and Lucius friends? I see 'em talking from time to time, but she talks to everybody. What's this all about, Thurmond? I wish I knew, Dewey. I wish I knew. Can I have a piece of cherry pie to go? License and registration, please. I wasn't doin' nothing. License and registration. What did I do? You were blocking two parking spaces. Huh? Were straddling the line. There's a town ordinance against that. There's no one in the lot. Law's the law, son. It's called a gateway crime. You got to be shittin', me, man. Sorry, sir. You ever get over to the west part of town? Ah, I haven't been over that way in a while, You know, probably a month or longer. A month or longer? - You're sure about that? - Mm-hm. Don't go over there to see Delaine Moore, maybe? I wouldn't blame you if you did. Mighty good looking woman? Hell, if I was younger, I'd try to see her myself. I work with her. And that's it. Hm. Then you're dumber than I thought. Are we done? For now. Take this is as a warning. Next time I write you a ticket. Hello? Where will you be the minute you wake up dead? Lucius. Lucius, that ain't funny. You'll soon find out. Hey, sweetheart. Hey, Russ. Yeah, what's going on? Um... Could I maybe stay at your place tonight, or well, for a couple of nights? Delaine, I've told you before, you can stay as long as you want. Thank you. You're good man, Charlie Brown. I look forward to it. See you tonight. Okay. You gonna get that, Delaine? Mm. No. It's probably just somebody trying to sell me something. Been gettin' a lot of them calls lately. Ah, it could be the sheriff. Might have some news about the investigation. Fine. Hello. Where will you be the minute you wake up dead? Sorry, I'm not interested. So, please don't call this number no more. Mm, that's annoying. Maybe you ought to block the caller. Good idea. I got your money. About time. No, it's too risky to give it to you here. Oh, so I'll come to your place later. No, Russ might see you. We got to meet somewhere else. How about I come to your place tonight? Fine with me. I can bring us some wine. We can celebrate. You got all of it? Oh, you'll get everything that's coming to you. I promise. Honest to God. Knock, knock. Well, hi, over there. I, uh, love what you've, uh, done with your place. Brought the wine, as promised. You'd better have more than wine in there. Oh, I do. I ain't got no wine glasses. Well, I didn't expect you did, so... voilà. I told you, I ain't much of a wine drinker. Look, I'll just have a beer. I think you're gonna like this. It's French. And I've been saving it for a very special occasion. - Hm. - Come on, just try it. Might find yourself surprised. To us, to a perfect plan and getting rich. Hm. You first. What, you don't trust me? Mm-mm. Why would I? Mmm. Satisfied? Ain't it good? Eh, it's a little sour. Lucius, you gotta broaden your horizons. You're about to become a very rich man. No, not after I pay out all the money I owe. Well, I think you should keep some of the money for yourself and enjoy it. Treat yourself to some... ...imported beer or some good whiskey or bourbon. Just give me the money. Patience is a virtue, you know. Mm-hm. Mm. Yeah. It's all gonna be all right. Gonna be over soon. How? Well, poison was in the glass before I poured the wine. It's amazing what you can learn on the internet. Why? Well, if you had just been patient, none of this would have been necessary. 'Cause everything was going so well. But then you had to go and make those phone calls and threaten me. Calls? I didn't... I didn't, I swear. Now you only have yourself to blame, Lucius. Look at it this way. You're about to uncover the great enduring mystery. You're gonna find out where we're all gonna be when we wake up dead. Well, at least us sinners anyway. Mm. It's so good. You seen Lucius? Jada, Lucius? Anybody seen Lucius? We open in ten minutes. - Hey, you seen Lucius? - No. He ain't here yet? Well, no he ain't here yet. And that ain't like him. - All right, well, you try calling him? - Yeah, I tried to call him, - but he didn't answer. - Well, maybe he's just running late. He'll probably be here soon. Yeah, well, he better. Where will you be the minute you wake up dead? Lucius? Hey... Let's get a move on. We gotta open. Uh, Dewey, uh, I'm not feeling so good. I'm sorry. I gotta go home. Hey, you can't go. I already ain't got no cook! And Penny called, said she's gonna be late. I'm sorry, I have to go. Delaine... You better be back for the lunch shift. Lucius... Answer. - Hello. - Russ. - Hey there. - Hey, uh, hey, listen, I'm just... I'm just calling to let you know I'm going to stay at your house again tonight, - if that's all right. - You know it is. - You okay? - No. What's wrong? I'll tell you when I get home from my shift, okay, just please be there. No problem. Bye. Get out of my car. Who are you? Easy now, wildcat. We're friends of Lucius. Or rather we was. What do you mean? Seems our friend Lucius is dead, which is a shame. 'Cause he owed me a shit load of money. But silver lining, you just came into a shit load. So seeing as Lucius is dead and you're the one who killed him, his debt rolls over to you. I didn't kill Lucius. He's alive. He just called me. Yeah, well, I doubt that, 'cause we just seen him. He's dead as a doornail. - But... - But, but, but, but, but... Save your buts, Princess. We saw you driving away. How you think we found you? How much you gettin'? Fifty thousand. Fifty thousand dollars. Well, Lucius, he owed me ten. What, with interest and all, carry the one divided by two... 20k should do it. Twenty thousand? By tomorrow. That's impossible. See, Mace, the wicked are stubborn and selfish. Do your thing. - No, no, no... - Mace! What are you doing? She's a waitress, dummy. She's on her feet all day long. You cut off her toe, she's going be hobbling around like a three-legged dog. You right or left-handed? None of your damn business. Well, it's a known fact that 90 percent of human beings are right-handed, so... No! No, no, no, no! Please, please, please. No, no, no! Please, please, stop... I have the money. I'll get you the money. Stop, please. Stop him! Okay, all right. I'm not a man completely devoid of compassion. You can keep your finger. For now. But if I don't get my money in two days, that little piggy right there, it's gonna go "Wee, wee, wee," all the way to the butcher shop. Time's up. This is Russ. What you doing for supper? I don't have any plans. Why don't you come out to the house? I'll throw a couple of steaks on the grill. Thurmond, is there something you want to talk to me about? I got some information you might be interested in. And I haven't been the kindest person to you lately. Okay, what time? I eat early. Five? Okay. I'll be there. Come in. I just came by to pick up a few things. Well, shit, come in and sit down and we'll have a drink. Come on. How is, uh, Horace doing? - He is hanging in. - Yeah? Just the medical bills that are killing us. Well, I want to know that I've been thinking about you. And I'm gonna come up with something, okay. Oh, I appreciate that. Shit. Cheers. It was a damn good steak, Thurmond. - Not much of a cook. - Mm. But I can grill with the best of 'em. So how long have you been here now? Um, going on seven years. Oh. After my wife died, I decided to build my dream home. I don't know why the hell I waited so long. What about you? How come you never married? Shit, I got close once. What about Delaine? I mean, she's fine. We're friends. And you're telling me that you two never... I mean, being neighbors and all. We're not that neighborly. Okay, okay. Excuse me for prying. Just habit of the job. So what's the, uh, information you wanted to talk to me about? Oh, yeah. Take a look at this. Lucius McFalls. Bad dude. You know that guy? No, I don't know him, but I saw him the other day. Where? Over at Delaine's house, he was helping her move her Daddy's shit out. I mean, he's got a hell of a rap sheet. - Well... - Petty stuff, but... still, it's just not the kind of person I would think Delaine would be hanging around. Well, obviously, I'll tell her. No, don't... tell her about it. Why not? Well, I shouldn't be telling you this, but... What the hell, I think you have a right to know. You're being used. Whenever there's a murder, we ask, "Who stands to gain from it?" Who stands to gain from Carl's death? I don't know. Delaine, of course. Why? Life insurance. Delaine stands to get over $500,000. So... I don't... I'm not following. What are you saying, Thurmond? I'm saying I believe that Delaine and hired Lucius to kill Carl, make it look like you were the original target. The old wrong house, wrong victim thing. Yeah, that's-that's crazy. I'm the one that brought it up. Played right into their hands. I bet Lucius is the one calling you. Hm. Lucius was seen driving on your street at 10:13. It puts him right there. Some shit. To top it off, Delaine and Carl are in a shit load of debt. Online betting. They were about to lose the house. So she's been borrowing money from Dewey and then working extra shifts to pay him off. Thurmond, who else knows about this? Nobody. Like I told you, I shouldn't be telling you. But I wanted to confirm a couple of things. And I... I think you have a right to know. Well, I appreciate it. I really do. Thank you. Now, not a word to Delaine. Okay? Not a word. I promise. Hey, sorry I'm late. You okay? Yeah, I'm just glad you're home. I'm here now. What's going on? Russ, I can't thank you enough for how you've taken care of me since Daddy died. Well, listen, I'm happy to help. I would've done anything for you. Okay, Russ, there's something I gotta tell you. Okay, I'm listening. I just... I don't know how you're going to take this. I think I could use a beer first. Cool, you know where the fridge is, right? - Grab me one, too, while you're at it. - Okay. You get lost? So, there's something you wanted to tell me. Tell me about your day first. I mean, it was good. I went over to Thurmond's, we had steaks, and he updated me about the investigation, so... You? I'm the one he should be updating. Well, I think he was gonna fill you in tomorrow, but, uh, he won't be doing that anymore. Why not? Well, I shot him. What? Yeah, he's dead, Delaine. I shot him. Why? Old Thurmond was a little smarter than I gave him credit for. He knew everything, Delaine. Well, not everything. I, mean he didn't know that I... I knew everything, too. I owe people money. And they won't wait, so I can't wait. Look, the insurance company will pay out as soon as the sheriff wraps up his investigation. The money'll be here any day. Yeah. Aren't I the fool? And to think that I suggested the wrong house, the wrong victim theory to Thurmond. You don't know the whole story. Oh, yeah? What don't I know, Delaine? Tell me. First, why don't you tell me what Lucius is doing in your trunk? Well, he's protecting us. No body, no crime. - Us? - Yeah, us. You see, you and I, we're going to split the insurance money. What people don't understand is I lost a lot of money when the merger didn't go through. I'm about to lose my business. I don't understand. I was with you when I got one of them calls from Lucius. - Yeah. - How do you explain that? Pernie. Yeah. I gave her the recording. And you did exactly what I thought you would do. You see, Pernie, she's broke, too. So when I told her about my little plan, she, you know, was eager to help out for a... a small cut, of course. Lord have mercy. So, Delaine, once again, what don't I know? This wasn't my idea. It was Daddy's, his-his cancer came back stage four. So that's why you killed him? He was gonna commit suicide, but then I wouldn't get any insurance money. We're in debt from his gambling habit. About to lose the house. Russ... I didn't know you then like I know you now. If I did, I never would've gone through with this. I never meant you no harm. Do you expect me to believe that shit? It's the God to honest truth. Delaine, you killed your... We could have made a go of this. I was falling in love with you, Russ. I really was. If you would a only minded your own business. But money is money. And if you interfere again, I will kill you. I'm leaving now. Hey, hey, it's okay. Hey, shh. Listen, everything's gonna be okay, all right. We'll just split the money. Okay? I'm sorry, I can't lie. Try as you might, you can't escape His all-seeing gaze. Do you think He who made the eye, doesn't see? Do you think He who made the ear, doesn't hear? Do you think He who judges the nations, doesn't punish? He knows all and will reward the righteous according to their good deeds. But the wicked, oh, the wicked. He will punish in eternal hellfire that was created for the devil and his angels. So, beware my friends, your sins will find you out. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but soon. Oh, shut the hell up. Hard to believe, ain't it? Surely is. Sheriff filed a murder and another body dragged from the reservoir. Sure is some meanness in this world. Amen to that. Tillman, what'll you have? You got a minute? Just about. That is one heck of a shiner you got on your head. You know the last time there was a murder in this county? - Nearly 30 years ago. - Okay. Okay, so now there's been three murders in just a few days. Hold on. Gotta take this. Yeah? Is that right? When was this? I'll be there directly. Make that four murders. Russ Potter's body was just found in the reservoir. Not far from Lucius McFalls. No, that's not... That's not possible. I just saw him the other night. You know what all four have in common? You. What are you saying? Oh, see, there's your daddy. Russ Potter was-was your neighbor. You worked with Lucius McFalls. And Sheriff Fowler, he was investigating your daddy's killing at the same time as his murder. Don't that strike you odd? Kane, your mind is perverted. I'm not gonna sit here and take the slanderous attacks on my character. If you'll excuse me, Miss Betty over at table seven needs her check. Hey, hey, just one more thing. Now, how come you drove Russ Potter's car to work this morning? He let me borrow it. And where's your car? It got stolen. Did you report it missing? I'm reporting it now. Excuse me. Miss Betty. Here you go. - Delaine! - Comin'. It's for you. Now, you know I don't like personal calls. Make it quick, please. Hello? Where will you be the minute you wake up dead? - Who is this? - Oh, who do you think? - What do you want? - You're a bright girl, figure it out. - How much? - Well, half sounds good. I wasn't gonna be so greedy, but since you put me out of work and jobs for women my age aren't all that plentiful, I think I deserve to be greedy. Yeah, well, I ain't got the money yet. Oh, I know that. But when you do, don't forget about old Pernie. Old Pernie knows everything. And don't think you can get rid of me like you did the others. The minute you step foot on my property, you'll be dead before the other foot hits the ground. And turn your cell phone on. Pernie don't like being ignored. You sure work a lot. Yeah, well, I got bills to pay. Well, I would pray that I'm on the top of that list, We got a problem. We got a problem, huh? What is our problem? Pernie. What's a Pernie? Oh, Pernie's not a what, she's a who. And so why is she our problem? Because she knows everything. And she wants a big cut, and if she don't get it, she's gonna go to the police. And if she does, I go to jail, which means no insurance money. Well, I still don't see how she's our problem. She's your problem. She wants a cut, give her a cut of your cut. Nice upgrade, by the way. When I say she wants a cut, she wants all of it. She's blackmailing me. What'd you have in mind? Ain't nobody here. Maybe we got the wrong house. No, we got the right house. This is the address Delaine gave me. Maybe they're out for supper. At midnight? Use your goddamn brain. Something ain't right. What... the...? You remember to get gas? - Well, yeah. - Well, then why ain't she starting? Uh, I don't know. Go check under the hood. What for? 'Cause that's where the engine is, dumb-ass. Battery ain't connected. Get out of the car! Hey, you. Nice work. Cancer ain't got me yet. Yeah. - It's done. - Are you sure? I said it's done. And thanks for the tip. Even if it was you who sent 'em my way in the first place. And how do I know it's done? Oh, trust me. Those boys won't be seeing their mamas no more. Now, it's just the two of us. You be sure to let me know when that check comes in. Remember, old Pernie knows everything. So you keep sayin'. Just don't want you to forget. I gotta go. Customers are waiting. What the devil? Oh, girl, you should know better than to mess with old Pernie! Whoo. How do you like that, you old bitch? We got a 10-50 on Davis Crossing Road at the entrance of... Got a 10-79 female. Ten-four, en route. What's going on? Ah, shit. Where are you? Dewey, Dew... Dewey, I'll be there in a few minutes. Well, you just need to get here. Okay, the lunch rush don't even start for another good half hour, okay. And I'm gonna need you to work double shift, too. Okay. Yes, I will work the supper shift, too. Okay. Bye. Bleeding Christ. Delaine. - Tillman. - We have a warrant for your arrest. Arrest? What charge? You're under arrest for the murders of Carl Moore, Russ Potter, Lucius McFalls, and Pernie Cannon. Now, you have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in the court of law. You have the right to attorney. If you cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed to you. Do you understand these rights I've said to you? Sure. Thank you. Mm. Y'all don't understand. Understand what? Well, I was only doing what come natural. Ain't greed natural? How can you or God blame me? You broke the law. The law. Oh, okay. So I'm a sinner because I broke the law? Mm. Or did I break the law because I'm a sinner? What does it matter? Well, it matters 'cause if I knew the answer, I'd be free. Yeah, I don't... I don't know about any of that, but... I suggest you stop talking. All right. Let's go. It's a funny question to ask. "Where are you after you die?" For me, it's not an altogether unpleasant place, but I can't speak for other souls. And I do sense that if the totality of your actions are more good than bad, you end up on the right side of your maker. For those who tip the scales the other way, well, as the radio preacher says, "Hell is hell."
