Hi! You've reached Eva Marsh. I can't take your call right now, but, if you leave me a detailled message I'll get back to you as soon as possible. Good afternoon, everyone. To those of you who are here today, thank you. Since so many of your classmates are out sick, I'm gonna use the second half of today's class to hold individual meetings about your upcoming projects. But first, let's take a look back at last week's discussion about composition. Now that we all know how to dynamically compose a shot, let's have a look at how that applies to portraits. You're all familiar with classic portraiture. These are the kinds of images we see everyday. But, as we've discussed, photography is an art. Portraits don't have to limit themselves to commercial conventions. Now, tell me, what do we learn from these images? What makes them different? How do we distinguish between commercial photography and art? Yes, Danielle? Can you please go back to the previous picture? There's something about this picture. I think it's in the model's eyes or her smile. It looks like there's something more. Hi. I'm Steve Jones. This is my colleague, Martin Reed. Hi. Eva Marsh. Ms Marsh, you've applied to the administrative assistant position. - Yes. You would be working for Martin, who is the marketing VP of the Montreal branch of NRP. I have to say we were intrigued when we received your resume. You don't seem to have any job experience. - Well, I've been modelling for the past ten years, so that was my main occupation. I thought I recognized you. You were in that ad for Re- Rejuvenate cream. Yes. That was me. - You do realize that this would be a much different work environment than modelling. I'm fully aware of that. - And you're ok with this? Ms. Marsh? Yes. I'm sorry about that. Can you please repeat the question? - Why are you interested in this job? Well, I studied business in college, but my modelling career sort of just happened, so I went with it. But, now I'm at a time in my life where I need to make choices and start building my future. I always thought your company would be a nice place to get started. Must be hard to get modelling gigs are your age. Yes. The job here entails a lot of data entry, filing, typing up sales documents, drafting, things like that. Yes, I can do that. I love writing and I've always been good with grammar and spelling. I can assure you I'm very dedicated, you won't be disappointed. How well do you handle stress? Fairly well. Hello? When are we gonna talk about it? It's yours. Hello? Yes, of course. Hold please. Hello? Yes! Of course. I'm delighted. No, no, no, it's not a problem. I understand. I'll be there. Thank you. Have a good evening. I got the job. Training starts next week. They need me to come in on Monday to fill out some paperwork. That's fantastic news. See? I told you things were gonna get better. And you'll see, this is gonna do you a world of good. And you have the weekend to rest and get ready. I know this is gonna be a big change for you... but I'm here. I'm here to support you. I miss you. We have a disturbing update on last night's story of the couple found deadppin their house. Althought the deaths of Lana Smith and Mark Poe were originally reported to be a case of murder-suicide, an insider close to the investigation is saying it appears the couple may have been ill for some time and there are indications of cannibalistic behavior. Again, these details have yet to be confirmed by detectives, but it certainly is a bizarre twist in what is already a shocking story. A few weeks after the discovery of a mutant strain of the Influenza C virus, researchers have announced today that a flu epidemic is in-- Citizens of earth. You are captivated by the female human breasts. Becau-- - Close your eyes. We call upon the power of the darkness! Hey! There he is! - Hey! Hey man, long time no see! - I know, too long! I was starting to think you were ignoring me! You've been back for a month now? Yes, I know, I know. I had some things to take care of. Yeah, I can imagine. Still, it's no way to treat your best bud! How was New York? Good, good. The pictures came out okay. Considering I had to cut it short and come back. I should be able to reshoot in a few weeks if I need to. I just wish I hadn't gone in the first place. Hey, listen man, there's no way you could have known. I know, I know. Still, I should have been here. For Eva. If I had, she wouldn't be so depressed. Is it that bad? I'd rather not talk about it. Montreal health officials have confirmed that the recent flu outbreak has reached pandemic proportions and is officially the fastest moving pandemic on record. Montreal public health protection department said the virus is spreading so quickly that it is now pointless to count every individual case. Henceforth, national health authorities will only report on clusters of severe cases, deaths caused by a new virus, or abnormal clinical patterns. Emergency rooms in the city are currently operating at a 175 % capacity. Therefore, unless infected individuals fall into a high risk category such as infants and seniors, public health officials are urging people not to leave their homes and to remain calm until the virus has been contained. Due to the gravity of the situation, Quebec Health Ministry has instituted a preventative lockdown on all schools and businesses for the island of Montreal and it's surrounding areas. We are reportedly on the verge of a public health crisis and we need the public's collaboration until we can regain control of the situation. Emergency food banks and medical facilities... - Hello? Yes. Yes. I just heard. I understand. Thanks for letting me know. You know, I was actually looking forward to my first day at work. I'm sure it's just for a few days... It's a safety measure. It works to your advantage, doesn't it? - Please, not again. Why are you always pushing me away? What are we gonna do? - I won't be in the way. I can use Jonas' room. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to... Come on... I know what you want. And I know what you want. The coroner's report has not been issued yet, but we are getting new information that indicates the recent string of unusual deaths in the Montreal area might well be associated with the viral outbreak we are experiencing. I'm hearing from my sources that extreme anger or possible brutality might be a secondary symptom of the mutated virus it would be wise to avoid contact with any person you think might be infected or who is displaying erratic-- - Are you okay? No. - Why? What's wrong? I'm just so scared... I don't know how to... What if it just gets worse... Hey, hey, hey, it's gonna be okay. Evert hing's are gonna back to normal before you know it. I need you. Sorry for everything. For pushing you away... - Don't worry about it. Everything's gonna be fine. No. I'm coming right back. It's James! Howdy neighbor! Come on in. It's good to have you over. Here's to good health! Hey, hey, hey, careful! You gotta make eye contact when making a toast. Otherwise you run the risk of suffering seven years of bad sex. I didn't know you were supersticious. When it comes to that shit, I don't take any chances! - Okay. Cheers! So, how are you two doing? Still enjoying your little love nest? - Yes. Everything's fine. You're not wearing your ring. I forgot to put it back on after my shower. Eva got a job. Is that right? - Yes. Yeah, she was supposed to start today, actually. But, given the situation... I guess it will start when things calm down a bit. - That sucks. Must be hard toget over things when you just spend all your time alone here. Not as hard as pretending everything's fine. Music. That's what was missing. Hey, Eva. You might like the new novel I'm working on. - Really? Oh yeah. It's about betrayal and deception. See? It's really about a lonely housewife who spends all her time alone at home. Until one day, while her husband is away on a business trip... she-- This just in. authorities have officially denied rumors that the current pandemic is due to the deliberate release of bacteria, toxins, or viruses by any government agency. Also of note, with the sudden increase in reports of acute violence, it has been suggested that blind rage might be one of the outbreak symptoms. Therefore, authorities are urging everyone to be very cautious and to report any suspicious to local authorities. But, most importantly, citizens are advised to stay indoors and remain calm. We'll bring you more updates as they become available, so please stay tuned to this station. That sounds nuts. It's almost like something out of a zombie movie. Brains! BRAINS! I made you laugh! See that? I made him laugh! It's good to make him laugh. You should try it sometime. Oh come on... don't be such a sourpuss! Humour is good to aleviate tensions. And I think we all need to lighten up a bit. Enough! Eva, please. Tell me, James. Do you have someone in your life right now? No. But I'm looking. If you know anybody... Ah! Still single. That explains why you keep shoving your nose in other people's business. Please... - Stop it, Sam! Is your life so fucking miserable that you revel in people's misery? Do you get such a sick kick out of knowing that our life is falling apart that you have to come here to witness it all? You know what James? You're just a fucking loser. You're a meaningless drama whore and nobody gives a shit about you or your work! No one! - Eva! That's enough! James, I'm sorry, I think maybe-- - You! You, out of all fucking people, have no-- James, are you all right? You fucking cunt Fucking liar! Get out! Get out! James What the fuck are you doing? - Get out! That fucking bitch... - Get Out! I don't want to be sick... I don't want to be sick... Calm down, calm down! You're fine. I don't want to be sick... I don't want to be sick... You're fine! - Don't tell me to calm down! How do you know?! - You're just shaken up. You need to relax, okay? He thinks he can just come in here and pry... Come, I'm gonna run you a bath. Let's go. I'll go get rid of it. What's wrong? - I... I thought... Nothing. It was nothing. Sorry I scared you. Not to panic, but we must announce that this television station and all its networks are shifting into emergency mode and instituting an all-channel alert. Again, this is not a test This announcement will be followed by a list of emergency notification phone numbers and a blue screen. We will resume broadcasting as soon as it is safe to do so. Stay safe and stay calm. Emergency help line, what is your emergency? - Hi, I'm afraid my wife might be infected. - Is she feverish or having coughing fits? No. - Has she been acting erratic or been prone to losing her temper. - No. She'll be fine, sir. - She's been in contact with an infected person. What kind of contact? - Our neighbor was over he's sick and he coughed up blood on her. Did she breathe in or swallow any of it? - No, of course not. Sir, I don't see any reason to be alarmed at the moment. Keep a closeppwatch on her and stay at home. If anything manifest, bring her to one of ourppmedical shelters immediately. - Can you tell me what this virus is, exactly? We're not at liberty to disclose such information, but we do have the situation under control. What does that mean, not at liberty to disclose?! Sir, I need to ask you to remain calm. - Don't tell me to remain calm. Our lives are in danger. Sir, have you been feeling feverish? - No. It's chaos out there my friends. Death, quarantine, cannibalism... God is dead. And if God is dead, that leaves a void to be filled. Power vacuums never go unfilled for long, friends. It's the law of the universe, the natural order. ...So it make perfect sense that our trusted, chosen leaders, the power hungry people in grey I've warned you about... That they would step in and take control. Because that's what they always do. We've given them permission. They have absolute power. and it's ours fault They are our elected law-makers. They decide what's right and wrong. They decide who we go to war against. They even decide what we can do with our bodies. They're essentially, already God. Sam! What's going on? He was trying to get in. I saw a man, I think it was James. You sure? - You gave him a key when you left for New York, remember? He gave it back to me. - Look, someone was trying to unlock the door! Are you sure it was our door. You know we always hear the neighbors when they open their door. I'm not crazy! - I never said you were! Look, I'll make sure nobody gets in. Okay? Thank you. And if you're paying attention, you'll see they're not a God of love, no. They are a cruel and angry God. What does God do when he's angry? He clears the deck and starts again. Come in. There is no way out. There is no hope. Hey! It's survival of the fittest. How are you feeling? - Good. Still a bit shaken up, but I feel rested. What are you listening to? - They've been broadcasting stories about people who've been infected I've been scanning trying to get information, but nobody seems to agree on what the virus is. I just want to make sure you're okay. I feel fine. ...to assess everyone's physical state. We will be taken to the medical shelters where we will be exposed to the disease. That is if we haven't already been infected. in a sicklystate, all will is lost. Your body become a compound of flesh and bones. Wait, no! Are you fucking crazy? It's not safe to breathe what's out there! Are you trying to make sure we're infected?! I feel like I'm dying. We're constantly breathing the same recycled air! - Oh now you want fresh air! Since when has getting out of this apartment been such a priority?! Have you stopped to think for one second, that the reason we're not infected is that we haven't gone outside. Hey, where are you going? - This shit is making you crazy! I'm not gonna let you infect me! Guess what? What? - It's for real this time! I still have to go to the clinic this afternoon for confirmation, but all the tests are positive! Oh my God! I'm gonna be a father! You really have no idea how happy you make me! I can't believe it. We're gonna have a baby! I don't want you to worry about anything, alright. I won't. - I'm gonna take care of everything. I'm gonna redecorate the studio, make it into another bedroom. My studio? It's the only other room. Of course. Duh. Hello? - Hi! You tried calling me? - Hi mom! I have good news! - Yes. I'm pregnant! - Oh honey, are you sure? - Yes, I just did three tests. No, no, I mean are you sure that this is what you want? Of course. We've been trying for so long. I know. - Aren't you happy for me? Of course, I'm happy for you, honey. It's just that I wanna make sure that you've thought of everything. Of your career. You that it's gonna take you a while to lose that baby weight, right? I mean, you ain't getting younger. But my gawd, you're too young to be stuck doing catalogue work. Eva, honey, I just don't want you to make the same mistake that I did. Look, I won't open the window. Don't you trust me? That should do it. Sam! Get the fuck out of my room. Hello? Speaking. Fine, thanks. How are you? No, no, it's no problem. Of course, yes, I'd love to. I can think of someone. Yes, I can get someone. No problem. No, I can work within those delays. Great. Just send me the information and I'll make all the arrangements. Excellent. No, thank you very much. Good bye. - What was that about? This is a great gig. They want me to create a series of test shots for a new ad campaign in New York. It's part of a whole new marketing strategy merging fine art and advertising. They're asking different photographers to each create a series that reflects their own vision for the campaign. I have total creative control. - Wow! That's so great! I'm happy for you. So, when are we leaving? Well... Given the situation... - But, I'm not even showing yet! Why would you do that? It's just... we works so well together and you know this would be good for my career. I know. I just... I would rather you stay here and rest. There will be other opportunities. Better ones. After the baby is born. This was our song. Every time I hear it, I think of you. Are you ever gonna tell me what happened? Why we're falling apart? Do you remember how happy we were? Mommy? Hi! - Mom? I need to talk to you. What's the matter? Is the baby okay? Yeah. The baby's fine. It's just... I don't think I can do it. - Oh, darling, it's normal to have doubts. Everything is gonna be fine. You're gonna be a great mommy. You'll see. No, I can't. - Now, Eva, stop worrying. You'll find a way to get rid of that extra weight once the baby is born. - What? No, it's not what I'm talking about. - Well, what then? It's just Sam. He's so... different. - Well, he's probably just stressed. That's normal. - I don't feel like he's attracted to me anymore. - Well, you know, I can understand that if you're letting yourself go and wearing those ugly, baggy clothes. I mean goodness, put on some makeup. Everything will be fine. You just give it some time. I'm so sorry, mom, I gotta go. I love you. Bye. Hi, you've reached Sam, please leave a message. Sam. Something happened. I'm fine, but, Jonas... I lost the baby. I'm so sorry. This is hard. I'm so sorry, Jonas. Eva! Eva, is everything alright? Sam just called. Fuck. Oh, fuck. Oh, Shit. Hello? Yeah, I need an ambulance. My neighbor, she's lost a lot of blood. I don't know... You need to send somebody right now. 967 Riverside. It's apartment 417. Hurry! Eva, everything is gonna be okay, alright? The ambulance is coming. James... - Doctors says you need at least a week of bedrest. You know, you can call me day or night. Whatever you need, I'll be here. Thank you. I'm not doing this for you. I'm doing this for Sam. He can never know. - Oh, he'll know. He's gonna know everything. If you say anything, I'll say that you came on to me. You snuck in here, in the middle of the night, that you raped me. And that caused me to miscarry. Jonas... I'm feeling so numb... but you have no idea how much I love you. I just need some time. Once this is over, we'll be so happy together. And safe. And I'll protect you... ...and I'll make sure nothing ever happens to you. ...18... 9 Cholera. 1900. Bubonic plague. 1900. Yellow Fever. 1918. Influenza. 1918. Typhus. 1942. Malaria. 1957 Influenza. 1961. Cholera. 1968. Influenza. This current epidemic is our demise. Misinformation maintains social chaos. Social chaos facilitates genocide. Genocide goes hand in hand with modern power. By keeping us misinformed they're keeping us in a vulnerable state. Sam! Right where they want us. Did you get the message? The troops have marched into the city blocking an entry or exit point, keeping the able bodied in check. It all makes sense now. This ingenius plan to gain control over our bodies... Can you see? We are their test subjects, the guinea pigs of the new world order. Those who do not fall victim to their sickness will join their ranks and together they will form a new elite. The sick are being weeded out with intricately engineered biological warfare. This biochemical stratagem was planned from the start: release a pathogen, test its effects, weed out the weak. And with the survivors, form a new, greater society. Power is a right of seizure, of possessions, time, bodies, lives. In a sickly state, all will is lost. Your body becomes a compound of flesh and bones that can be controlled, that can be experimented with... Do you understand? ...and optimized to serve the interest of the new ruling class. You serve the needs of the few, there is no choice, there is no free will. Sam! Sam! Come on, it's not funny! Let me in! Let me in! Eva! So glad you finally decided to join us. Eva... Why, why, why? When this whole thing started I didn't know what to make of it. Then it became obvious. This plague is a sign. To put us back on track. When James came here the other night, I wanted so badly to be the one on the receiving end. Not you. my sweet angel. You've already been through so much pain. What a blind fool I was. Isn't it funny how people always turn to religion for answers, when so often the truth is right in front of them. Sam! Please... Sam... I'm not sick. Sam. Look at me. I'm fine. For all we know, the epidemic is over by now. I'm surethe authorities have managed to contain the virus and they're just waiting to announce it. James was sick. But I'm not. Don't you think some of the symptoms would have been showing by now? Please, untie me. You are sick. Can you blame for wanting to keep a little piece of him? You can't blame me for holding onto this. For still loving him. - I felt so guilty for abandonning you. For putting my career before you and then Jonas. Think I was somehow responsible for your miscarriage. No, Sam. Look, no. I can explain. You don't understand! No, Sam, no, no, no-- The darkness in your soul is starting to seep through. Sam! Sam, no! Our first visitor! Hey man! You're all settled in? Yeah, come on in, neighbor! So, do I finally get to meet the special lady? - Eva, this is James, James, this is Eva. - Wow. I didn't think it was possible, but you look even more stunning in person. - Thank you! It's a pleasure to meet you. - Likewise. Thank you so much for telling Sam about this apartment. - You like it? It's perfect. - Well, I'm glad. I'll leave you lovebirds to it. And whatever it is you're doing, keep doing it. I don't remember the last time I've seen this guy so happy. I will. "The woman you put here with me, she gave me some fruit from the tree and I ate it." And the lord God said to the woman: "What is this you have done?" The woman said: "The serpent deceived me and I ate." So the Lord said to the serpent: "Because you have done this, cursed are you above all livestock and all wild animals. You will crawl on your belly and eat dust, all the days of your life." To the woman, that's you, "I will make your pains in childbearing very severe. Through painful labor, you will give birth to children. Your desire will be for you husband. He will rule over you." Do you still desire me, Eva? To Adam, he said: "Because you listened to your wife and ate fruit from the tree about which I told you 'you must not eat from it', cursed is the ground because of you. Through painful toil you will eat from it all the days of your life. It will produce thorns and thistles for you. By the sweat of your brow, you will eat your food until you return to the ground. For dust you are and to dust you will return." Now, what do we learn from this passage? That I shouldn't blame you, because you are flawed. Since the very beginning, women have been creating suffering and misery. I shouldn't have let my guard down. But we can start anew! There. Isn't that better? You see this? This is a dead thing! No, no, no, no, don't cry. We have to destroy to rebuild. Don't you want to rebuild with me? Eva, don't fight me. I am doing this for your own good. Because I love you. You are rotten to the core, but I will help heal your wounds. Will you cooperate? Drink this. Come on. It's for your own good! Don't you want us to be happy? Dammit, Eva. Drink! There. That wasn't so bad, was it? Sam... I beg you... Please help... Jonas! Shhh! It's okay. It's okay. Oh my God. No. Stop crying! It's okay my love, mommy will be fine. One more. One more. Sam? Sam? Make me a baby.
