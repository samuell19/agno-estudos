But the great astronomer shattered that conceit, and we were forced to admit our planet is but one of many which swing around the Sun. That there are other systems beyond our solar system in myriad worlds. But the great biologist made us see that our physical organism is the product of a vast evolutionary process whose laws are no different for us than for any other form of animal life. | think it was decided before your disagreement with Meynert. Frau and Sigi cried the whole... You won't forget me, Sigi? There are many who would deny it a place in the pages of the Encyclopedia Medica. Excellent description of hysteria may be found in the records of witchcraft trials in former times. Its victims were supposed to be possessed by the Devil. There were veritable epidemics of this delusion. Whole communities were infected. Yes, it was infectious, yet it had no germ. Hysteria violates the medical tenet that all bodily symptoms must be of organic origin, and the psychological tenet that the mind is capable of only one thought at a time. But the facts do not cease to exist because they are in contradiction to our beloved theories. My dear Jeanne, how long have you been unable to walk? - Since 1880. - Six years ago. Did anything happen to you at that time which might have brought on your illness? The patient remembers nothing. Yet we've learned from her relatives that the appearance of her symptoms followed immediately upon a railway crash. She wasn't injured physically. And here, we have, to all appearances, a classical example of paralysis agitans. flowing through them. You are cured, cured! You can even stand upon them. Yes, you can stand. Rise up and stand upon your legs. Splendid, Jeanne. Splendid. Open your eyes, open your eyes! Walk, now. Don't be afraid. Walk around the room. And now, having demonstrated that we can remove symptoms by suggestion, let's see if we're able to create them as well. When I clap my hands, Stand still, Jeanne. Do you see Servais over there? Remember how he shook? Do you, Jeanne? Like that. Wasn't it, Jeanne? And now, your arm is shaking like his did. Now both your arms. Shaking, shaking. And your legs. You can't stop, can you? You shake, shake. Gentlemen Now my assistants are going to awaken our patients. They will remember nothing. As beautiful almost as my own Amalia was on our wedding day. How do you reconcile this with Charcot's theory? If her mind had been divided, why would remembering the traumatic incident relieve a symptom? The darkened part would produce wild ideas. No. Charcot is mistaken. Trauma doesn't divide the mind as an axe splits a log. It only causes the memory of the incident to be struck off from consciousness. But how can unconscious memories create symptoms? Because they are surrounded by emotions that cannot find their natural outlet through consciousness. If you are overcome by grief, you shed tears. Angry, you strike a blow. Frightened, you run. The emotion aroused in you is discharged in physical action. But, what happens if the emotion is dammed up, strangulated? There's fire in the fireplace, but the chimney is blocked. The fire doesn't go out. It smolders, and smoke fills the room, the entire house. And finally, it leaks out through a pantry window. A morbid symptom is only emotional energy coming out the wrong place. Freud, what do you think? | think a door has been opened. You've made a discovery as important as Pasteur's. He isolated the germ, you've isolated the pathogenic memory. Cecily's may be a unique case. I'm rather inclined to think she's a classic case. Would it be possible for you to try out this method in the hospital? Yes. You row to the middle of the lake, what happens then? - I stand up. -Yes? The boat rocks. I'm falling. The boat turns over. I'm in the water. My brother calls for help. | swim around the boat, but I can't find him. - My brother is gone. - Where is he? Drowned. The boat sinks! - I swim for the shore. - You swim? | swim. What are you doing, Dr. Freud? | order you to stop this at once. Quiet, you fool. In Professor Meynert's absence, | am in charge here. - He doesn't approve hypnosis. - Damn you both. | shall tell Meynert what you said. I'll tell him myself. What can I do for you, Herr Freud? Professor Meynert, did you give anyone authority to stop me practicing hypnosis? Of course. But the patient was from the general ward. He wasn't from your department. You are, Freud. You realize you're forcing me to resign my post at the hospital. You renounced science completely the day you rejected my offer and went to Paris. Paris, the path to fame and fortune. Six easy lessons... A la Charcot. How dare you say that? How will you prevent it? You'll hypnotize me? At my command, everyone asleep! The blind at attention! You are ordered to see! Paralytics, about turn! Quick march one-two, one-two! Heil, Sigmund Freud, the conquering here of neurosis. As if you knew what a neurosis is. As if your Charcot knew. It's a way of making life possible and you rob them of it! You would bring the light of understanding into their poor benighted souls. And the evil spirits will fly away when the cock crows. Look. Yes, scorpions. The fatal kind, from Mexico. I'm testing the effects of their poison on the nervous system of higher animals. Charming little fellows. Here's the sun test. Well, Freud, do you think light kills evil spirits? | rather think it revives them. If the box remains open, they'll run about everywhere. The room... the world will be alive with them. Back into darkness. There you are. Leave to the night what belongs to the night. - Schnapps? - Thank you, I don't drink. You don't drink. You'd be too afraid of letting yourself go. What would let slip if you got drunk? One takes every precaution. One walls oneself in. | know what you are. I've been observing you for a long time. | am certain that neurosis is lying in wait for you. | know the symptoms. | know why you're attracted by other people's madness, because it makes you forget your own. How would you like your old master to be sick of hysteria a la Charcot? How well you'd take care of him. No luck. I'm as sound as an apple. Goodbye, Freud. Leave and don't come back. And my wife said: "I'm not jealous in the slightest,‚Äù but I would like to know how you have the nerve to play the ladies' man with other women in front of me who knows from bitter experience that you're not a man at all... Dance music. It's coming from a house across the street. They are dancing on the terrace. | love to dance. | long to be with them. How do you do, Herr von Schlosser? Yes, very much. He? Your father? - A girl of 17. Every night. Mother. Mother. Mother. No, dear, it's Martha. Your wife. Sigi? Sigi. Dr. Breuer is here. Breuer. This is an honor. | was making a call nearby and thought I'd stop in. What've you been doing with yourself? Between patients and chess problems, another article for the Neurological Journal. "On the Origin of the Acoustic Nerve". But this is pure anatomy. It's good to be back with experimentally proven facts. | was homesick for neurology and I didn't know it. What about Studies on Hysteria? The discovery is yours. | contributed nothing. There's no reason you should share the credit. You look a bit peaked. How's his appetite, Martha? He eats hardly anything. Sleeping properly? Tosses all night, and cries out. I'm going to examine him here and now. - Sit down. Open your shirt. - No. No. There's nothing wrong with me, I assure you. What is it then? | understand you gave up Fraulein Wolf's case. Yes. And Herr Brenner and Frau Jonas. - Yes. - Surely they weren't all cured? | couldn't go on prescribing cold baths and massage. I'm surprised at your prescribing them at all. - What else is there? - Need you ask? You should see the Koertner girl. She's living proof of the effectiveness of our hypnotic method. Tell me, Freud, when was the last time you hypnotized a patient? I... I don't remember. Which case was it? Eh... Which...? | know. It was... It was the son of a general. His name escapes me. - You never told me about him. - There's a little to tell. | saw him once. He was psychotic. | was forced to commit him. I'd like to know, why did you stop in the middle of our work? Meynert said, "It's better to keep scorpions locked up in darkness." I'm forced to agree with him. You were making such strides forward, giant strides. Did you know Meynert had a heart attack? | was called in yesterday on consultation. Will he recover? Matter of weeks or days. - Should I give him any message? - No. Well, I must be on my way. I've calls to make. Martha. There's nothing wrong with him physically. Thank heaven. - How is Mathilda? - Very well, thank you. She's been after me to take a holiday. | can't even get Sigmund away for an afternoon in the country. That's the penalty for being a doctor's wife. Let me hear from you. You sent for him, didn't you? Didn't you? Yes. I thought you might be ill. What is it? I can't bear to see you so unhappy. - Won't you tell me? - There's nothing wrong with me. For Dr. Freud. Sigi, a coachman is waiting. Professor Meynert. What does he want? He's critically ill. Breuer just told me. The arrogance of the man. "Come immediately". He's dying, Sigi. How amazed he must be at the thought. He always took himself for Jehovah. Freud? Come in. Closer. Come closer. I've read all your pieces in the Neurological Journal. Your style has become more sober, less belligerent. You've learned how to set forth your views without wounding anyone. In short, they're fit for the waste basket. - If you asked me here... - Spare a dying man. Breuer says that you've given up the idea of proving the existence of hysteria. A pity. | could have settled the question by presenting you with a classic case. Who? Myself. | have a whole complex of symptoms. Migraines, night terrors, even paralysis. Remember how I carried my right hand-thumb hooked around a waistcoat button as though I was having my portrait painted? You never suspected, did you? Did you know this when you drove me away from your clinic? | knew it before Charcot. I've known it for 20 years. And yet you held me up to ridicule before our colleagues? Ham was accursed by his father for seeing him naked. You're my spiritual son. I'm not sleeping. I'm gathering my energies. Sit down. Don't interrupt. Neurotics form a brotherhood. They learn to recognize each other as I did you. They have only one rule: Silence in the presence of the enemy. Our common enemy, the normal people who would knock our deformities, torment and degrade us. You belong to the brotherhood. | feared you because you seemed determined to betray us. So I did what I could to discredit you. My life has been a sham. | misused my talents, hiding the truth even from myself. | suppressed my real being. The result, I'm dying in a state of pride and ignorance. | don't know who I am. It's not I who lived my life, but another, the creation of my vanity. Break the silence. Do what you set out to do. Betray us. We need a traitor. Go to the heart of our darkness. Hunt out the dragon. Angels and saints slay dragons. | am neither. If you lack the strength, make a pact with the Devil. What a splendid thing to descend to hell and light your torch from its fires? Farewell. Farewell. She longs to be moving to its rhythm in a man's arms. Now when you see where it's leading, you shrink from it. you'll answer Dr. Freud. Cecily, you're going back in time. Back in time. You're in Naples, in your room, at the hotel. It's night time. There's a knock at the door. Could you to take over my practice for me? - I'm going to Venice. Won't you kiss me goodbye? Your friends' wives know all about it. | seem to be the only one who doesn't. What are they saying? It's not so much what they say as how they say it. Slyly, in whispers. | trust you. Sigi, what is it? but her condition hasn't improved. Frau Koertner wanted me to take the case again. It's out of the question for obvious reasons, so |I... recommended you and she agreed. Dr. Freud, I'm so tired of being sick. At night, sometimes, | lie in the dark and cry for hours. It's like a prison. Tell me, uh... did you have any illness before your father's death? The usual childhood ones. Nothing very serious. Umhmm. Once when I was 14, | was in bed for several weeks. - Why? - I couldn't walk. My legs wouldn't support me. Father thought it was one's duty to enjoy life. He took me everywhere. We were always together. | even ran this house when mother had her accident. What accident? She was out driving one day. Her cart overturned. She hovered for some time between life and death. - How old were you then? - Thirteen. It was the happiest time of my life. | didn't mean it like that! Of course I missed mother. But... I don't know. Father let me arrange the flowers at table and seat the guests. | could put up my hair and wear jewelry. We made a very handsome couple everybody said. Six nights of the week and up till all hours. - And the seventh? - Father played Tarock. He loved that. | suppose a serious man like you doesn't approve of card playing. It happens to be my favorite game. | must revise my idea of you. You said it was the happiest moment in your life. Then your mother came home. And everything was changed. It was back to hair ribbons and bed at nine o'clock. She insisted I be brought up as a prostitute. When in fact it was a house of prostitution. heard that word? Putain. Which means "prostitute‚Äù in French. You're making progress. Let's go on. Where did we leave off? Where should we start? Let's go back to Red Tower Street. Christmas time. You're waiting for your father. You said it was important, my remembering what made me faint. But why? Could remembering that help me to walk again? That was the occasion of your first attack. he was out making love to streetwalkers! as the cause of her neurosis. But it could only have reflected some earlier trauma. Earlier? How, in the innocence of childhood, could a sexual experience be traumatic? Say he is the victim of an adult's aggression, I'm tired. | have other patients. She walked. The aggression was remembered and she walked. Yet something is wrong. What about the doll? It's the evidence of her father's crime. She should hate it, yet she loves and cherishes it. Yes, something is wrong. Perhaps the answer lies still further back, as in my own case. Yes. We stopped overnight in a hotel in Breslau, to break the journey. At dawn, we boarded again. Every time the train whistle blew, you cried with terror. You said it was an animal in pain. A big animal. | must have heard that same whistle on the way to Breslau, and it didn't frighten me. No. You only cried on the second half of the journey. Then it must've happened in the compartment. What? The trauma. Whatever incident it was I connected. With the whistle that frightened me so. - But nothing happened. - You're sure? Come. But you can have me for nothing. So, it should mean all the more when I say you mustn't stop. You mustn't stop, Sigi. my love, and above all, hide the good news from the Philistines. One night after I'd done my turn... | went back to my dressing room and there was a man sitting there. A handsome swell... with a flower in his buttonhole. Six weeks later we were married. to Red Tower Street last night? | marvel at the ease with which you suit things to your own convenience. Yesterday you condemned parents. Today, the children are guilty. There is no guilt in sexuality at its source. Only after the river has passed through cities. | disapprove of your new theory. It repels me. Do you think I'm going to risk my reputation as a man and physician, simply to have my name on another book? We could sign our contributions separately, if you like. No! I will not be connected with it in any way! Well, then, let's leave the chapter out. Thank heaven. In that case, | shall read it as a paper at the next Medical Congress. And end your career in one night. Freud. Sigmund. Your father asked me to look after you. Take his place in your life. You've accepted me. I've loved you as a son. Yes, and I've loved you. As your spiritual father, | forbid you to read this paper. The time comes when one must give up all one's fathers and stand alone. So, before he can understand or contend with it, he is consumed with jealousy. Trapped in a conflict between love and hate. There is little new in this. The ancient Greeks revealed their knowledge of these truths in the story of Oedipus, who, all unknowing, killed his father and took his mother to wife. And... And thereafter, was condemned to wander through life, blind and homeless. The shadow of this doom lies over us all.
