This one you killed today, señorita, she looks nice with the others. But I still haven't seen the black panther - you promised, Paulo. - We found one, señorita. As soon as we make this automobile chug, chug again. Oh, I better see what luck they're having with the carburetor. Calling Manaus airport. Calling Manaus airport. Come in please. This is Manaus airport. Greetings, señorita. We were just going to contact you. - How is the hunting? - Excellent. What about our carburetor? You are in luck. We have it. And a private plane has offered to drop it off by parachute. It should be over your location in four or five hours. When you hear the engine, signal with your lights. I was willing to pay for a chartered plane, I... I don't like to impose on anyone. There is no other plane available, señorita. And the very famous American flyer, Colonel Warburton, is leaving now for Rio de Janeiro. You're all set. Go wind 'em up. Get aboard, kids. I represent the Brazilian news service, Colonel. Any special purpose to this trip? And, uh, will it take you around the world again? No, not this time. And if it must have a purpose, why, uh, you might call it a hunting expedition. These gentlemen are hunting oil wells, and Dean Hartley is going to hunt butterflies in the Andes, and I am-- And he's gonna hunt butterflies too on Copacabana Beach. Preferably a blonde one. And the señorita? Does she hunt too? Oh, I'm sorry, this is Doctor Lawrence. - What are you hunting, Doc? - A vacation. And add 50 bucks you bet me I wouldn't come. Aren't you a little afraid? One lone woman and four handsome gentlemen. Oh, she's no woman, she's a doctor. All aboard. - That's gin. - Oh! This isn't my day. - That's 85 cents I owe you. - Eight-five cents? A while back - it was four bucks something. - No, wait a minute, that was in the USA. We're playing for pesos now. Doc, you're an international crook. Dean, where are we? Dean, where are we? Huh? Oh. Jerry, where are we? Two hours from Belém. That's our next stop. After that it's just a tiny hop to Rio. Oh, you pilots and your tiny hops. I suppose that means five hours? Uh-uh. Ten. But it'll be worth every minute of it, Doc, because when we get there I'm gonna devote the entire evening just to wining and dining you. Uh-uh, not until I've had a week'’s sleep, you won't. - Like old times, huh, Skipper? - Yeah. But without those beautiful blossoms of bursting flack to keep our feet warm. Hey, where'd that come from? Look up ahead, there's plenty more. It's closing in around us. You kids better get back and fasten yourselves down. It's liable to be a little bumpy. Wait, somebody's calling us. It's Manaus. NC 695 in Manaus. Come in, Manaus. I'm glad I was able to contact you. We have just received a weather report. Barometer falling fast. Bad electrical storm ahead of you. He says there's a bad storm ahead of us and that never mind about the carburetor. Listen, señor, that storm isn't ahead of us, it's all over us. Ask him how we're gonna get out of it. You'll have to listen closely and turn off your present course. It would be impossible for you to continue. I should hope to tell you I'll listen closely, señor. Come in. Turn 90. Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute. Was that 90? Can you make it louder? Ninety-seven degrees? Hey, señor! Señor! What happened to you? Come in, Manaus. Come in, Manaus. That's it. That last bolt must've blown every tube in the set. All we can do is try to keep her on course. He said it was impossible, I heard that much. - Should I drop a flare? - Better save 'em. Can't be anything down there but jungle. I want to try it upstairs. No use. They're probably having the same storm on the moon. Hey, look! Everybody okay? Dean's beetle bottle fell on his head, and Frank thinks it's something he ate, but they'll recover. We're pretty lucky to get through that one with nothing than a dead radio. You and your big mouth. Maybe we can make it on one engine. On one good engine. You better drop that flare. Fasten your seat belt, Doc. I'll have to set her down, I may not be able to find a soft spot. What is it, Paulo? Boys say they hear a plane, señorita. It's still a long way off, but you better turn on the spot light. In jungle, they don't see it until they straight up. - Turn it on anyway. - Si, señorita. Well... I'll do the best I can. Don't make your prayers too long, you may not have a chance to finish 'em. Paulo... the plane is in trouble, is it? - They're trying to land. - Si, señorita. Is there any place they can get down safely around here? Oh, no. I know jungle. Very thick. Bad country, bad people, bad Indians. Head-hunters. Better die and fall down. Head-hunters don't get 'em alive. Nothing we can do. - Oh! Ouch! - No bones broken. - I told you it was okay. - Oh, then why'd you jump, sir? - Because you're pinching me. - The rest of you boys all right? - Jerry? Dean? Frank? - Yeah, we're all right. It's a good thing you reminded me back there that I'm a doctor, not a woman. - I'd love to have hysterics. - Good time for it, Doc. Well, there's nothing we can do except wait for some daylight. I have a feeling we're not gonna like what we see. Even then. Jerry thinks we're a few hundred miles due west of Belém. What do you think, Professor? What? Oh, yes, he's absolutely right, uh, - near the Amazon. - What makes you think so? Flora, vegetation, uh, insects common to the region. But then again, I don't know. What's the matter? I just found a potato bug. We might be in Idaho. I'd say our number one problem is food. Number two, being found. I think you can dispose of problem number two. We've been found. Listen. - They're Indians, aren't they? - Unquestionably. Likely of being friendly, huh? We're in headhunter country, you know? Oh, you mean if we just give 'em our heads, they'll go away? Yes, the most interesting people in the world. Fascinating, really. And what they do with human skulls, first the subject is decapitated and then with the use of extreme heat, the bone structure of the skull is removed, allowing the nostrils to be sewn up. And the needle is brought back, and back to the upper lip here. And from left to right, it is sewn up completely. And then by reversing the head, - burning hot sand is-- - Hold it. Here comes Doc. - Anybody want coffee? - Might as well. Thank you. Hey, do you boys hear drums? Or is my blood pressure up that much? They're drums, Doc. Dean thinks we should stick pretty close to the plane until we find out whether their owners'’ intentions are friendly - or unfriendly. - Are you kidding? I'm not only gonna stay close, I'm gonna get inside. I think we all should. Break out whatever artillery we've got. Frank's got a shotgun, and I've got my service pistol. - Oh, I got a knife. - Hmm. I wish I'd studied to be a witch doctor. They've been drumming for five hours. You make a beautiful target in that doorway, Jim. I want the first shot. I've only got a few shells for this thing and I might convince them to take us with caution. I think our company has arrived. I can hear 'em, but I can't see 'em. They'll probably be all over us before we can get a shot. I saw a bush move. Maybe this birdshot will flush the babies out. Hello. Well, hello yourself. Oh, uh, pardon the shotgun, I-- I was expecting somebody else. I'm glad to find you alive, Mr. Warburton. How did you know my name? I'm afraid I'm partly responsible for your being here. Carburetor was for one of my cars. Sorry. It wasn't your fault that I crashed. Oh, uh, this is Doctor Lawrence. This is, uh-- No time for introductions. We have to get moving. Those drums aren't for... What kind of a doctor? Well, just a doctor. Nothing special about me. Paulo, have some of the men get those things out of the plane and hurry up. Si, señorita. Those drums are pretty frightening. But they sound much worse when they stop. If you know what I mean. No. What? They're drumming up their courage. So as long as they drum, they don't attack. What do you think of her, Doc? Well, I think she doesn't like doctors. - Or maybe just women doctors. - Yeah. Her reaction was funny. You know what? I also think she's the most intriguing woman - you've ever met. - You can say that again. Why should I? You heard me. - What do you think, Paulo? - I think no slow down. Head-hunters use poison in arrows. We can't waste a minute. Let's go. Get inside! From the look on those natives' faces, - that was a close one. - Very close. Now the next obvious question is, where are we going? Just stay on this trail. There's a small settlement not far from here. - We'll camp there tonight. - Good. Perhaps there'll be time for introductions there. Well, after all, you can't blame me for wanting to know who you are. What a young and beautiful girl is doing alone in the jungle with a pack of natives. Please Mr. Warburton, I-- I don't answer questions. I don't like to be asked questions. Oh, I'm sorry, I-- I didn't mean to be nosy, but... Well, how can I thank you if I don't know who you are. I'm the one who must say thanks. For the carburetor. You all set for the night, Doc? Yeah. Her mysterious majesty has asked me to share her pavilion. Don't think I'd like that. Something about the lady makes me nervous. Like a keg of gunpowder packed in ice cubes. I don't think the invitation includes you anyhow. - Where's the skipper? - On the prowl. Something's making him nervous too. I wonder what. - You start, señor. - Hmm? - Make the thing chug, chug. - Oh, sure. You got a screwdriver? Mixer's too thin, that's all. - That oughta be better. - Oh, that's fine. Cigarette? Well, thanks. Um, your boss, Paulo, she is a very interesting woman. Señorita Ridgeway? She's a fine lady. Ridgeway. Well, tell me what is, uh, Miss Ridgeway doing here in the jungle? - Right now? - No, no, no. I don't mean now. I mean, why is she here? Nobody knows. Maybe she like hunt. Very fine shot. Well, uh, does she live here like this all the time? She come in maybe once in some years. Maybe once two years. Stay for a while. - Sometimes long time. - Alone like this? Isn't she afraid? Señorita, she's not afraidfor nothing. Where is she from? I don't know. She knows. You ask her. You know something, I just figured out why you upset me so much. Oh, I upset you? From the minute I first saw you. And was more than just the sight of a young girl in the jungle. - It was? - Mm-hmm. I'm convinced we met someplace. I thought perhaps you might tell me where. - No, we've never met. - Oh, but we must have. I-- I'm only trying to recall where. Of course I can't blame you for not being able to remember me, but neither can you blame me for not being able to forget you. Let me see. I have it. - Ridgeway. - I don't know you. We've never met. Never. How could you know my name? I'm sorry, that-- that was a pretty crude trick. I got your name from Paulo. I thought maybe you'd, um, bend a little to an old acquaintance. - Oh, I see. - Am I forgiven? If it'll make you feel better. Then can we start from there as new acquaintances? All right, as acquaintances if you like, Mr. Warburton. - Jim Warburton. - I'm Christine Ridgeway. Now, would you mind telling me what a girl like you is doing in the jungle alone? I... I choose to be alone. I feel at home here. Out there I... I feel perhaps, conspicuous is the word. And I don't like it. But how can you avoid being conspicuous? Why, that's like telling people not to pay any attention to the moon - when it's at its brightest. - Please don't talk like that. No, we must talk about something. I'd prefer to talk about you, but you choose the subject. Love, life, letters, rose culture, presidential elections, anything you say - as long as you don't leave. - Very well. We'll talk about you. Tell me, who you are, what you've done, and what you hope to do, besides, uh, thanking me. You know, well, I, uh, I'm trying to remember what I was before I met you. Let's see, well, there was a war, remember? And after, I was restless and lonely. But this is all very dull, I know all about me. Surely there must be something more interesting to talk about with one so lovely and so young - and so-- - Good night, Mr. Warburton. Forgive me, I'm very tired. Chilly, isn't it? - Eavesdropping? - Couldn't help it. I was just about to look around when the corn started to pop. Hmm. Yeah, well, I guess the approach was a little rusty. Musty. You must realize she's not standard equipment. All right, so I started wrong. What do I do now? What do you wanna do? Starting now. Well, I just wanna crack that shell of hers, that's all. Research, huh? I think she's afraid of something, Jim. Something that's probably none of your business. Well, the guide said she's afraid of nothing. Oh, nothing physical, but... there's something on her mind besides her pretty hairdo. Mm. You're usually right. Am I? Then I'll tell you something else I think. I think I've traveled 3,000 miles, been cracked up in a jungle, been heckled by head-hunters, all to see the new look in the eyes of the woman wary Warburton. Night, Jim. My foot hurts. Good morning. You found something good about it? Oh, Doc. Sleep well? Like a log. Mahogany, if you want details. Good morning, Miss-- - Buenos días, señor. - Oh. He was packing equipment. - Well, where's Miss-- - She left hours ago. In the station wagon. - Where'd she go? - Who knows? - When's she coming back? - Don't look at your watch. Look at a calendar. Maybe next year. Maybe next week. Oh. She wrote you a letter. Oh, thanks for the prompt delivery. No mention it. Well, that's that. - Let's go. - Where to? Where the lady says, Obidos. And by boat to Belém, and from there we'll fly to our destination. Mr. Warburton, please. - Letter for you, sir. - Thank you. - Nothing for me? - No, señorita. - It's from Jerry. - Read it. Well, they left Dean at La Paz a week ago and Jerry and Frank, they're stopping in Lima and heading north towards Venezuela, and they all send their love to you. Oh, every time you get a letter, I get homesick. Wanna go home? I think I can fix up a ride for you. Well, I don't want to, but I have to soon. - What about you? - Well, I think I'll stick around for a while. Might even go back up the Amazon. Oh, brother, are you stuck. - Stuck? - Now, look, you don't think I think you're going back up there just to play tag with those head-hunters, do you? Well, of course if I should happen to bump into her. Yeah, her carburetor may need, uh, tuning up again. Hmm. How about dinner tonight? A very handsome young doctor is supposed to take me sailing. - See the harbor by moonlight. - Hmm. - Jealous? - No! Worried. You can't swim. - How are you gonna get home? - I could learn. And who said I wanted to? So you wanna go to the races? Well, I'm supposed to visit a hospital this afternoon, but if you twist my arm... - Well, maybe-- - Oh that's enough, I'll go. Oh. Better put a little bet on that chestnut colt. - Which chestnut colt? - Number two. Bingo. Oh, I don't like the way he breathes. I bet he has a throat obstruction. Won't last long. Now I know, you're a horse doctor and a bad one. That's a good colt. What can I lose? Put 50 on number two. - Fifty? - Yes. Give the man the 50 you bet me I wouldn't fly down here with you. And, uh... - put this on for me. - Si, señor. Number two. Come on you little chestnut colt. Come on, Bingo. Stay up there. I think he's gonna make it, Doc. I shouldn't do this, but... - there she is, Jim. - There he is. - It's a colt. Watch him go. - Uh-uh. Your jungle Juliet. You're rooting for the wrong horse. His name is Bingo, not Jungle. Stretch out, Bingo. Come on, Bingo. Come on. Come on, Bingo. Come on. Come on. Maybe you don't know it, but we just won a hat full of Brazilian lettuce. Even though you were rooting - for the wrong horse. - I wasn't rooting, chump. I heard you. You were rooting for jungle Ju-- That's it. Little more to the right. I'll excuse you. But don't you think it would be better to just walk over there instead of jumping at her - like an excited kangaroo. - Oh, yeah. Yeah, thanks, Doc. Uh, I'll be right back. Too bad. I could've given you the winner. It's not important. How long have you been up there? - Just a few moments. - You might have said something. Yeah, the last time I said something, it drove you straight into the jungle, and out of my life. Aren't you a little dramatic? I was born that way. Now, I've had a relapse. - When did you get into Rio? - Yesterday. - May I? Thank you. - Of course. Now, don't jump and run at the next question. Would you mind telling me where you're staying? At the same hotel you are. I saw you at breakfast. Oh, you certainly avoided me. I didn't see you. It never occurred to me you might want to. I... I wasn't avoiding you. - I forgot all about-- - Excuse me, señorita. Colonel Warburton, I have a message for you from the lady. She said she had to leave to take a swimming lesson. Or maybe to buy a bathing suit to swim back from a yacht. Does that make sense, señor? Yes, that makes sense. Thank you. Just a moment, Christine. Is there anything wrong, señor? No, no, but I find it necessary to change my plans. I won't be registering. Shall we dance before dinner? Um, no, not just now. But tell me, your, uh, friend... aren't you neglecting her this evening? You started to say girlfriend. - Yes, I did. - She isn't. Oh, uh... relative? No, not even that. She's the family doctor. Now, will you dance? All right. - Did you say Miss Ridgeway? - Yes. Do you know her? Yes. Yes, we've met. And, uh, would you have my bags put back in the car, please? I'm leaving for the airport. Yes, sir. Miss Ridgeway, a letter. Excuse me. Anything wrong? Did you see the gentleman who wrote this note? - Oh, why yes, señorita. - Where is he? Where did he go? He started to register, then said he had changed his mind. But, where is he? Uh, he went to the airport, I believe. Christine. Is there anything I can do? No, no, nothing. It's just something personal. Then shall we go in and have that dinner? - No I wonder-- Do you mind if I? - You're leaving again? No, but, would you take me out of here? Why, of course. Where? I don't know, anywhere. - Mood music? - If you like. Turn it off, please. Oh, sorry. - What is it, Christine? Why? - Don't try to analyze me. I'm only trying to understand you and... - what it is you're afraid of. - Afraid? I'm not afraid of anything. You're not afraid of any physical danger, that was obvious out there in the jungle, but... an ordinary everyday question, a note on a piece of paper, a waltz on the radio, and you become panicky. Why? What is it? There is something you couldn't understand. And don't try. No, Jim, don't. I've been in love with you since the first moment I saw you. You mustn't say that. And if you want to see me again, there mustn't be any more talk about it. I don't want to hurt you, but... anything between us is... impossible. All right, Christine, I won't speak to you again. Till we have breakfast together tomorrow morning. No, we won't have breakfast together. Lunch? Dinner? You're going to get awfully hungry. You have to eat. And wherever you do, you're gonna look up from your table and there I'll be. And no matter where you go, I'll follow you. I believe you would. Yes, I'm quite sure you would. - No, no. - Christine, I love you. Can't you understand? I know you're sincere and feel you've every right to speak as you have. It's my fault for not making you know in the beginning that it's hopeless. If I were any other woman in the world, I'd be in love with you this moment. But, I can't ever love you or anyone. And I couldn't stand the pain of telling you why. But this you've got to understand. There's been a tragedy in my life, a sorrow, nothing, no one can ever heal. I don't know that I want it healed. Well, if you let me share this trouble whatever it is, I... I could understand, I could help. No, you can't. No one can. But you can't spend the rest of your life alone. Running from place to place, watching life and never being a part of it. - You're so young and-- - Stop! Stop it! Don't ever use that word again. - What word? - I hate it. Scare you? Jim! Jim! Jim. Christine. But you-- you are so young. And adorable, they tell me. Only I'm not Christine. Huh? Huh? - Hey, how'd I get here? - That lady delivered you like a Christmas package, last night. Hey, hey. Take it easy. That was a nasty bump. It would've split any normal skull. I've gotta get out of here. Don't you realize how she travels? - She may be in China by now. - Oh, relax, she's still around. You sure? She's been in to visit you twice. And I must say you did very little to entertain her or me. Did you talk to her, Doc? What did you find out? Nothing from her. Plenty about her. Look, Jim, there are some people who have been so deeply hit that one doesn't ask 'em questions. Or try and kiss 'em when they don't wanna be kissed. Even in the shadow of Sugarloaf. - She told you that? - You think she's a cat? You were very talkative until I gave you a sedative. Okay, Doc, I'm not gonna ask her any more questions and I'm not gonna try and kiss her again. But I'm not gonna let her get away from me. I want her on any terms, Doc. But she won't have me, won't have anything to do with me. I'm not so sure she won't have anything to do with you. - She say so? - No, but... obviously she's concerned or she wouldn't be so upset about giving you that bump. Now, get back into bed. Oh, no, there's work to be done. Okay, okay, I'll drink it. That wasn't meant for you. I'm the one with the headache. Ugh! I'm sorry. But I want you to understand this, Doc, I'm going to marry her. What do you say to that? Good hunting, Jim. No you don't seem-- Mm. Don't seem very happy about it. You don't think it's fair to her that I won't settle down. That's what you're thinking, isn't it? Wanna bet? Well, I will. If she wants it that way, I'll settle down, live in the jungle, I'll live any-- I'll get it. Hello? Yes, this is Dr. Karen Lawrence. Oh, yes. Come on up. Guess who? No, no, tell her to wait. I have to shave. I-- I'm not even dressed. I can't see her like this. Don't trouble seeing me to the door. And don't say it would be a pleasure. - Come in. - Good morning, Jim. Good morning. - Had your breakfast? - Uh, yes I did. Cocktail, maybe? I'll order some. No, I wouldn't care for it. - Cigarette? - Uh, no, thank you. No? Oh. Why don't you sit down. I'm glad you're feeling all right. Oh, I feel fine. I... I only hope I didn't, uh, damage your windshield. No, it's harder than your head. It was my fault, the whole thing. I should've had those tires checked. Oh, no, it's not your fault. You know, I-- I owe you an apology, Christine, for last night. Taking you by surprise and upsetting you with a lot of questions and everything. Don't apologize. Don't apologize ever. - What are you thinking about? - Hmm? - Thinking about? - Mm-hmm. You're thinking about something. You're not here. You're looking at me, but you're not even seeing me. I'm sorry, that-- that's true. I-- I was thinking. About running away again, I suppose. Well, regardless of what happened, I have no intention of letting you get away from me. None at all. I still think it's completely irrational of you - to have dragged me along. - Who wants to be rational? Look, someone may have told you about the birds and the bees, but they obviously forgot to stress the emotional peculiarities of the little girl birds and bees. Two is company, three is as dull as December... - to the third. - It was my idea. - Oh. - She thinks I'll start proposing for a moment, if we're alone. Hasn't she accepted yet? Oh, a girl likes to keep a man on the anxious seat. You know how you'd be. What's the matter, Christine? Nothing, it's-- it's like a feeling you get in the jungle when-- when you're being watched. - Is she okay? - She will be. Hysteria, fright... - I better go. - Where to? I've gotta find that man before he gets away. - Maybe he knows the answer. - Jim... are you sure you wanna know the answer before the question is clear? I love her, Doc, and I wanna find out what she's afraid of. For I can help her. All right. Go ahead. - I'll join you as soon as I can. - Good. I've been looking for you. I intended to look for you. The young lady-- Miss Ridgeway is going to be all right. Oh, then it is the Ridgeway girl. - You know her? - But, of course. I am Don Sebastian Ortega. How do you do? I'm Jim Warburton. - Won't you join me for a drink? - Thank you, I will. Waiter! Another glass. Do I know her? I'm an old friend of her father's and of her mother's too. Although I haven't seen them in years, since their little girl was born. Amazing! She's her mother precisely. And when I saw her this way, all grown up... - Jim. - Oh. This is Don Sebastian Ortega. Doctor Lawrence. - How do you do? - How do you do? - Is she all right? - Yes, she's sleeping quietly. Tell me, have you any idea why seeing you should cause such a reaction? No, I have not. - And, uh, are you and she? - I expect to marry her. Marry her? But this is remarkable, that I should be here. I, who was along on her mother and father's honeymoon. You knew her parents that well? That well? I must tell you how well, young man, so you know what a wonderful woman this girl's mother is. Or perhaps you know her? She has told you of our terrible experience. - No. But I'd like to hear it. - Of course. Of course. Like yesterday, it's all so clear. For them it was both, honeymoon and business trip. Ridgeway had been sent out by a lumbar interest and his bride insisted on accompanying him. I was with him because... Well, if I do say so myself, no one knew the Amazon better than I. We outfitted in Belém, then headed straight for the interior. Ridgeway's young bride had never been in any jungle wilder than a city park. But she was with the man she loved, and if she did not like a honeymoon in the strange wilderness, she gave no sign. One of the Indians had given her a little monkey. It was love at first sight between them. But then, it was love at first sight for everyone who met this woman. Here, Peanuts. Oh, I suppose I'm gonna have to put a pot on my head to hold my bride's affection now, eh? See, Peanuts, he's jealous. Maybe you'd better humor him - and leave us alone, hmm? - Oh, oh. That's a hint for both of us. Mr. Peanuts, come on. Let's go put you to bed and see that the horses are all right. Let's go. What was it? Panther. It's just a big pussycat. Nothing to be frightened of. It won't attack anyone unless it's cornered or wounded. It's all right, darling. It's all right. - Oh, I thought you said-- - Oh, he wasn't after me. Peanuts looked like an easy meal - and I stepped into the picture. - Oh! We decided to remain in that camp for a few days. As it was near the stand up rubber trees which, uh, Ridgeway wanted to inspect. And there occurred that which was the most exciting thing in my life. And nearly the most terrifying. The jungle was quiet in the midday heat, as all its inhabitants rested. The panther incident had left us all jumpy, but the pet monkey had run into the jungle and had not returned. I suggested a siesta for them. I said I would keep watch. But, before I knew it... I fell asleep myself. Suddenly, I was alert. To this day, I don't know why. I thought it was merely to take another look at the Ridgeways that my eyes went back in that direction. But it must have been a presentiment of disaster. It was the wounded panther. You could see the splash of dried blood on its side. Stop it, darling. Stop it. Stop it. It's all right, he's dead. Everything's all right. It's all right. I went through a war, señor, without being very frightened. But you just scared the pants off me. As a doctor, Señor Ortega, you have yet to tell me the most interesting part of the story. What more is there to say? What more should you like to know? Well, the, uh... the effect that this experience had on her physically, and... spiritually and mentally. That's the most remarkable thing about that great woman. She recovered presently, insisted on dressing her husband's wounds. Then, lay down and fell asleep like a baby. Ridgeway wanted to take her out of the jungle, home. Uh-uh. She insisted the expedition go on. And never again on the trip did I see a trace of fear in her. That was... more than 20 years ago. Uh, I suppose you've seen them since. No. You see, Honduras has been my home, still exploring. But, one loses touch. I know they were living in Pasadena, California. Señor Ridgeway... had retired. If you'll excuse me, I better go and see if Miss Ridgeway's all right. Will you, Doc? I'd appreciate it. Señor... you are a fortunate man. Very fortunate. Well... salud. May I have the florist please? Oh. This is Mr. Warburton. That's right. I want to order a bouquet. The best bouquet of your whole vine covered career. That's right. Oh, no, no. Right away. This morning. Come in. Well, I-- I don't know. I should think some orchids. White ones. Good. Lots of 'em. Just a moment. Thank you. And, uh, some of those little, uh, what do you call 'em, uh, Cymbidium, that's right. Maybe some tulips and, uh-- Look, I'm going to leave the whole thing to you but I want you to understand this, that it definitely has to be a yes bouquet. Uh-huh. Thank you. Uh, Miss Ridgeway, please. Well, try it again. She's there all right. But she's got to be there. Keep on ringing till she answers. Come in. Hi, Doc! What a day, huh? Well, of course I want you to keep on ringing. I'll wait all day if necessary. - Hang up, Jim. - Huh? - Hang up. - I'm calling Christine. - Yes, I know. Hang up. - Why? 'Cause she won't answer. She's gone. Didn't you get her note? - But why? Why did she go? - 'Cause I advised it. - I sent her away. - You? - Yes, Jim. - Why? Because it was the only thing to do. Will you stop talking riddles. Why did you do this to me? I didn't do it to you, I did it for you. And for her. Look, why don't you try and trust me? I was with her all night last night, and I learnt things that I can't even tell you yet. One thing for sure, you were both headed for incredible tragedy. - Is this Mr. Ridgeway's home? - Uh, yes. Only, he's not in. Four o'clock, Mr. Ridgeway's at the cemetery. Memorial Cemetery. He goes every afternoon. - Oh. Thank you. - You're welcome. Sorry, Mr. Ridgeway. Hi. I didn't mean to intrude. Oh, it's quite all right. I've been expecting you. But you don't know me. Aren't you the man who's in love with Christine? Yes. I left word with my housekeeper that you would find me here if you arrived in the afternoon after four o'clock. Uh, Ortega wrote me that I could expect you, Mr. Warburton. What can I do for you? Well, I've got to talk to you, Mr. Ridgeway. About your daughter, Christine. What's troubling her, sir? My daughter... - Christine? - Yes, sir. What is it? - Or perhaps you don't know. - No, I do. Ortega told you of the time that Mrs. Ridgeway saved my life? Yes. But why should Christine have been so affected by seeing him? Why, I hope you don't mind my discussing it with you. If you're in love with her, you were right to some peace of mind. A right to know certain things about her. About us. Even though, uh, I'm afraid that knowing won't help much. Ortega told you of our experience in the jungle. I'd better tell you of a tragedy that resulted from it. A terrible shock. After we left South America... my wife and I lived on the Riviera for a time. It was there that our daughter was born. She was beautiful. And she grew to look surprisingly like her mother. When she was 20, the, uh... the incident occurred. There was a party for the young people at our home here in Pasadena. They were enjoying themselves with an infectious gaiety that seems to go out of us after 25. Gee, where is everybody, Mr. Ridgeway? Where is everybody, George? I seem to see a lot of people. - Oh, you mean my daughter, eh? - Well... yeah. I saw her dancing with Johnny a few minutes ago. - Yes, there she is. - Mm? Isn't that Mrs. Ridgeway? If, uh, you want to get rid of your future mother-in-law, Johnny, there are less painful ways than staying police. Sorry. You know I don't wanna get rid of you. Don't you think it's about time you danced with your fiancée? - Where is she? - I don't know. Why worry about her? You're the only person I wanna dance with. Remind me to investigate a conjugal. This is the mother, not the child. - Or are you just being gallant? - No, just stating a fact. - I think I've danced enough. - I'm sorry, I'll behave. - Mrs. Ridgeway? - Yes. I just want to talk to you. Something on my chest I have to get it off. - About my daughter? - No, about you. Why won't you give me a break? I'm in love with you. Johnny, we aren't going to have any more of this nonsense. - I'm sorry. I apologize. - Well, go back with the others. Do I have to? The others seem to be having a wonderful time. I thought you liked to dance. I'm sure they're having a wonderful time. But I could be too if only you... - I love you. - Johnny, you're insane. - Let go of me. - Yes, yes. I'm crazy all right. Because you're driving me crazy. How can I marry your daughter when I'm in love with you? I hang around this house night and day, just to be near you. What does it get me? I thought you loved my daughter. I do in a way, but only because she's a reflection of you. She's second choice and has been ever since I saw you and you know it. What's more, now she knows. - How could she know? - Because I told her. Told her everything that I've been telling you. But I'm in love with you and always will be. There's nothing either one of you can do about it. - You told my daughter that? - Yes, I did. Tony! Tony, have you seen her? Who? The bride to be? No, not for a time. Would you care to dance, Mrs. Ridgeway? No, George. Tony, something terrible's happened. Help me find her. Darling! Darling, wait, wait! Judy! Judy! Judy! My baby! When we recovered her body from the canyon... - Judy was dead. - Your daughter, Judy? Wasn't it your wife? I wanted to tell you as gently as possible, Mr. Warburton. But you must understand... my daughter is dead. You're in love with my wife. - It's a nightmare. - Yes. It's been a nightmare... this failure of my wife to age. - But why hasn't she? - I can't tell you exactly. All I know is the day she killed that panther to save my life, something snapped in her mind. She... she ceased to grow old. - But she seems so very young. - Yes, she was young. When Judy left us, she still seemed like a girl in her early 20's. Judy delighted going places with her. People mistook them for sisters. But, with Judith's death... Christine's supposed blessing became a curse. I'm beginning to understand what it must've been like. Oh, I wouldn't have you think that love left us, or quarrels, um, but her beauty lay over our house as a curse that had destroyed our daughter and was now separating us. She sought not the fountain of youth, but the serenity of age. And it was denied to her. I couldn't help her. No one could. The day came when she could no longer endure a house because it reminded her of Judy. No longer endure me because she knew how much I loved Judy. She refused to be seen in public all by her friends. She was sure they were pointing at her, accusing her of killing her daughter, but of course. Then, one day, she left me. Well, at first she wandered about Europe. For some reason, she always seemed drawn back to the jungle. In South America. That's where I first saw you. In Rio. I went to see if perhaps she was ready to return. But when I saw the happiness in her face... I knew you were good for her. I came home. Why, I think you're very kind to tell me all this. Oh... you had a right to know. Now I find it rather difficult to say what I had in mind. I doubt very much if two men ever faced each other - under stranger circumstances. - Well... I guess I always knew it had to happen one day. I, uh... Why don't you go and see her? - You know where she is? - In Santa Barbara. Dr. Jungmeyer's Sanitarium. You wouldn't mind if I went to her? Mr. Warburton, there's another thing you must understand. Since the first moment I met Christine, her happiness has been all that mattered. - Goodbye, sir. - Goodbye. Doctor Jungmeyer? I'm Jim Warburton. Yes. Oh, yes, I know. Uh, Christine, uh, Mrs. Ridgeway, she's mentioned me? Mr. Ridgeway told me to expect you. - She has spoken of you also. - Well, may I see her? I, uh... I cannot give you that permission. I'm only the consulting neurologist on the case. Her own doctor is here. Doctor? Mr. Warburton is here. Doc? Hello, Jim. You brought her here? - Yes. - He wants to see her. She doesn't want to see you, Jim. But she didn't say anything about you not seeing her. She's asleep just now. Thank you, Doc. I won't awaken her. In that room across the hall. It's, uh, it's difficult to put into words so the layman can understand, but... Well, you've heard of cases where a person'’s hair turns white overnight. They can age years in just an instant - from some horrible experience. - Yes, of course. Then think of some kind of dreadful experience that should have produced fear, but instead, found its climax in a complete absence of it. - The black panther. - Yes, in her case. The knowledge that took you away to fear meant a horrible death for her husband, destroyed her fear. She froze her mind. But with it she froze her body. Then, the shock of seeing this man, Ortega, released her. It was as though she had been unconscious from the time she killed the animal. Well... of course, this is only the simple explanation for it. And now she's a normal woman again. With a normal woman's emotions and fears. And you know what she fears the most? That she may have lost the love of her husband. Don't tell her that I've been here. Or that I said it, but tell her to go home. She needn't be afraid. Her husband loves her. Very much. It's no use, Jim. She won't go. All she wants to do now is visit her daughter's grave. And then... maybe go away again. Her daughter's grave? Let her. Let her, Karen. After all these years, Christine is with her daughter again. Her pale and lovely face still suggests a touch of guilt. And the tragic events of her life seem to be reflected in her eyes. She always felt that her life, too, ended on the same day. It wasn't so. At this very moment, a new life is just beginning for her. It was Karen and I who arranged that she visit Judy's grave at four o'clock. For a reason. For a very good reason. And there was something about this man I hadn't seen before. The-- the light in his face. The look of a schoolboy coming unexpectedly upon his sweetheart in a park. Rather a young bridegroom seeing his bride coming toward him. I'll never forget the sight of them as they met. As if the whole world and all its works had been devised for the accomplishment of this moment. Their embrace endured only for an instant. And then he took her arm, let her enjoy the pathway, both of them walking erectly, proud. An elderly man and a middle-aged woman. Moving together as if they had been separated by a day, instead of almost a lifetime. Thanks to SbR for the subtitle, subrip HookyB
