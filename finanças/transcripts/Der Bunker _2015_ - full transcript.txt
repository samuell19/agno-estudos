A great egg. Crispy on the outside with a strong structure... but the inside is alive. That's perfection. And the weather? Something's brewing. - A storm? I'm afraid so. I hope our guest can find his way. - He will. A guest? Come in please. Pleased to meet you. - Good to see that you made it. I'll show you to your room. Voila. Come in. Don't fear. Exquisite, isn't it? A bit spartan. No window. But you are in the middle of mother nature? Didn't you mention something about an ocean view? I doubt it. But there's no light coming in. - There's also no light going out. You were looking for peace and quiet, right? - I am. You will find it here. Here you can focus on your work. The rent's due in advance. Of course. Unfortunately, tyhis is all I have. That's alright. We'll work something out. You can help around the house. But first, a foot bath. Thank you. You're welcome. You're almost human again. And I will use this water to prepare a nice soup for us. That's funny. Can I have another dumpling? Of course. Three dumplings and a napkin. Do you like it? It's from the region. And you? I'm from the city. And what brings you here? I'm looking for some solitude so I can focus on work. Something scientific? - Absolutely. And for this, I will need complete concentration. If I may ask, what do you write about? Do you know the Higgs boson? Not personally, but it sounds interesting. The Higgs boson... - Mother, I can't sleep. You should be in bed. - I'm having nightmares. Do you want to come sing a song? Did you do your homework? - I tried. Excuse me. Your son? Yes, that's Klaus. Why? Thank you. Don't mind me, I just need my library. This is your work? Something mathematical? Atrological? With stars? That's one way to put it. I'm trying to connect fields. It's something new. If you need any help, I have a few diplomas. That's kind, thank you. I'm looking forward to an exchange of knowledge between two intellectuals. As am I. Heinrich? Are you there? I've been speaking to Heinrich. And? - He worries about Klaus. He's a slow student. - Rome wasn't built in a day. Be quiet. From now on, the student should be in charge of his education. What? But I am his teacher? Make sure the student takes charge. Then you can focus on your other talents. Our student. And, how is the water? It's nice and cold. I'm glad to hear it. You seem to be having a healthy appetite. Two servings at dinner, and a lot of napkins. Do you always eat this much? - Am I eating too much? No, that's not it... but I have an idea about your debts. My debts? - You see, normally I teach Klaus. But since I have to all the housekeeping on my own... You could help us out if you could teach him something. You are an academic, right? It should be a piece of cake for you. I'm afraid I have a lot to do and little time. I will hold back during dinner. Are you alright? I'm fine. Where is your son? But what is he doing outside? Why is he not at the table? Hello, Klaus. No, please don't speak to him. He's being punished. He's such a slow student. Klaus, if you do better in school you can join us. Thank you, mother. My husband... he has no time for housekeeping and no time for school. I don't know what to do. Without an education, Klaus is lost. Please help him. only a few hours.. I... Please. Alright, I will. A little distraction won't hurt. Thank you very much. You are a good person. Eat up. The soup's still warm. Very warm. Good. I'll leave Klaus in your hands. Klaus? - Yes, father? Today this student will tutor you. - What? Why? Don't argue with me. During lunch we'll see if there's any progress. And don't forget, he needs to be a man of the world. And if he won't listen, there's a cane under the map. Am I clear? So you're Klaus? Hello, nice to meet you. Very well... let's get started then. The global economy What do you know about the global economy? that it's big. Micro credits? They're very small. Maybe I should just read you something. What do you think? And so Alan Greenspan succeeded Paul Volcker at the central bank. Any questions? WWhat color was his coat on his first day? That's an interesting question. What else did you do? Capitals. Good. Let's have a pop quiz. What's the capital of France? - Brussels. Moscow. Italy. No. What's the capital of France? - Crete, Italy. No. - Paris? No. Capital... Yes. What's the capital of the USA? - America. What's the capital of France? - Atlantis. Will you show them that I learned something? But you didn't learn anything. - Because you taught me nothing. Give me your hand. What are you doing? Very well, let's start with the capitals. - The capitals. Every civilized man should know them. What is the capital of Norway? Oslo. The capital of South Africa? Pretoria. The capital of North Korea? Pyongyang. Wait a monent., Something's wrong, dear student. What is the capital of Turkmenistan? Ashgabat. Very well. Well done, boy. Come here. You too, well done. Then I'll get back to work. - Oh no you don't. You've done great. Finally a real in-house teacher. In-house teacher? What do you want? - Joke night. Here's another good one. A salesman of vacuum cleaners goes to a farmer's wife and knocks over the trash can. "Madam, every crumb this vacuum cleaner won't remove... I will personally eat with a spoon," he says. Then grab your spoon, we have no electricity. He has to eat the garbage now? - Yes. Father is funny. - He is, isn't he? Here, too, the author uses te differences... between urban technology and rustic traduition. A great joke... that plays with the archaic dualism of inside and outside. Where does the I end? Where does the You begin? That's genious. That's top notch humor. Well, enough laughing for one day. Time for bed, Klaus. Goodnight. Goodnight. Wait. I have another one. A pig stands before a wall socket and asks "Dear friend, who put you in there?" You studied well today. Mama is proud of you. But you can always learn more. Right? Mother? - Yes? I'm hungry. Ask Heinrich. Heinrich, can I have something to eat? Fine achievements are rewarded. Give the boy some food. Heidegger writes: In the being of this Being..... ...we find the void of the Nothing. Mister student? What does 'this Being' mean? This Being, that's not so easy. In principle, it means everything there is... except itself of course. Everything? My mother? And father? And me? - Yes, you too, Klaus. Mister student? What does 'this Being' mean? How old are you? Eight. You look older. - I'm eight. Were you always taught here? - Always. You've never been to a regular school? It's too easy for me. I'm gifted. And one day I will be president. President? You have big plans for Klaus. - Yes, president. Isn't that aiming a little high? - What do you mean? Well, there's a lot of people who want to be president. I just thought... Maybe Klaus isn't there yet. That is very rude of you. And offensive. Listem, I... - You are deeply offending all of us. I didn't mean to be rude. You saw how Klaus learned the capitals? Capitals, yes... but that's not enough to be president. Klaus, show this gentleman you can do it. What is the capital of Nigeria? Mama... Mamachusetts? Excuse my wife,. She's a bit weak. What happened? - The stress of things. You don't know what it's like to be a woman. You have a point there. What is it like? - Sot so good. Difficult. And you know this? How? - I read a lot. What do you read? Einstein, physics, the quantum leap, how everything is relative. That sort of thing. Time, for instance. If you read a good book, time flies. When you're at the doctor's, time crawls. Excuse me. You know, son. This hurts me more than it does you. I know, father. When you grow up, perhaps you get to beat others. When will that be? One day, son. one day. How cruel. That's raising a child. But it was my responsibility? Then you should stay. Perhaps we should punish you. I'm sorry, mother. - It's alright, dear. I can't focus on my work here. Then why not leave? Do you love your mother? Klaus has to learn, or he will be lost. He's a winner, not a loser. Yes, Heinrich. Yes, I will.. You are superior to any man. I thank you. Who are you talking to? Heinrich. Who is that? Heinrich is something very beautiful. Better and greater than anything. I was very little when Heinrich came to me . He came from far... the leader of a highly developed civilization from outer space. From that moment on, he came to me every night. We were happy, we were close. It lasted quite some time. Then Heinrich fell ill. He came to love with me... together with his people. Se for yourself. If you're lucky, Heinrich will speak to you too. Try it. Come here. Don't be afraid. You're beautiful. So beautiful. Please try again with Klaus. Help him. And I will help you. Capital of the USA? Heidelberg? Capital of Greece? - Brussels? This is pointless. Isn't this pointless? Capital of Russia? Prague? Capital of France? New York? Paris? Correct. Capital of Russia? Moscow. Correct, Klaus. Capital of China? Mother, father. I think I know the capitals. Let's hear them. Afghanistan, Kabul. Egypt, Cairo. Andorra, Andorra. Angola, Luanda. Australia, Canberra. Azerbaijan, Baku. Algeria, Algiers. Georgia, Tbilisi. Greece, Athens. Singapore, Singapore... and Cyprus, Nicosia. Come here, my son. Sit down. I'm very proud of you. And I only have four sore fingers - You always have your fifth finger. Knowledge is the explosion of curiosity. Kownledge is the light in the darkness. Knowledge raises us from barbarians to enlightened people. Klaus, without a doubt, is on the right track. With discipline, outr professor has led our son... to the highway of success. Sometimes one has to adapt his principles to reality. Capital of Ethiopia? - Addis Abeba. Very well. - Soon you will be in the White House. Let's drink to that. To our professor. That's enough for today. Is it too fortissimo? - What? No. Are you alright? You look a little pale. I'm alright. We could do something else. Maybe play a little? Play? What is that? You don't know what playing is? You've never played? Is that playing? It is if you throw back the sponge. - Yes, but mother said... Klaus, pick up the sponge. Come on. Klaus, throw the sponge. I like playing.. That's enough for today. Can I stay up for a little longer? As you wish. goodbye. What happens when you cross a woman with an octopus? I don't know, but I bet it knits very well. What are you doing? Come on. There, that's better. Wonderful. You look fantastic. So happy. Come. Come. Mother, I don't want to cuddle. What is it? Are you ill? Do you have a fever? - No, I just don't want to cuddle. You're lying. And liars don't become president. What's the matter, klaus? We didn't study. We played.. Played? Heinrich. I need your advise. What is it? - Klaus is behaving odd. What do you want me to do? - Klaus is being manipulated, dummy. If that student goes on like this he'll take Klaus away from us. Do you want Klaus to go away? Do you want me to leave you? I don't want Klaus to go. We'll do whatever you say. - Get rid of that student. You're right. That student has to go. Am I interrupting? Yes, I... Do you want to write something in my book? Okay, just put it down there. Here? Is that your work? There's something missing here. The missing piece of the puzzle. What's missing? Hey... Can I sleep here tonight? The bed is too small. - Please, I have nightmares. Very well. - Thank you. Do you know what day it is tomorrow? Monday. - Tomorrow is my birthday. There will be a big party. Will you be there? I think so. - Great. I'm so nervous. It will be the best day of my life. Goodnight, Klaus. Goodnight, student. Happy birthday, Klaus. We have gathered here today, dear Klaus... to congratulate you on your birthday. Thank you, mother. This is a special moment for you too, dear professor. We will let you... enjoy your well-earned retirement. Without you, Klaus would not be where he is today. Your work is done, your debt has been paid. Good luck in your future. Retirement? Does he have to leave now? But, my work. I... I am not yet finished. You can't send me away like that? You and your work. It's time for a party. Do you have to leave now? I'm sorry, Klaus. - Come on, let's dance. But you can't leave yet. You too, mister student. Let's dance. No. I don't want to dance. Diploma The student Come on, mister student. Come on, let's dance. Tourn around, over and over. Please. Tourn around, and again. Turn around, faster. Faster. You too, mister student. Come on, let's dance. Why won't you dance? Don't be such a drag.

I was so close. I almost had him. - What? The formula. The formula for the... Let it go. Klaus, you're better. Good. Sit with me. Mother, I'm leaving. - What are you talking about? You don't say something like that to your mother. Farewell, mother. - You're staying here. My leg. Stay. Stay.
