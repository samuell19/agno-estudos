THESE PECULIAR DAYS FRIDAY Emma Watson, Emma Stone, and... Don't start, man. - Isabel. - Fuck off. Emma Watson, Emma Stone, and Isabel, on a sinking ship and you can save only one and go fuck her on a desert island. Pick one. Emma Watson. - Did you think it through? - Fuck Isabel, man. She's a good swimmer anyway. - And she never taught you? - Fuck off. What about Emma Stone? Who gives a fuck? Seriously? I've got one for you. King Kong, Godzilla, and... - Bryan Cranston? - Bryan Cranston, fuck yeah. King Kong, Godzilla, and Cranston, on a sinking ship Save only one, and I guess you could fuck them. Who's your pick? - That's optional, right? - Yeah, that's up to you. King Kong, man. I knew it, you like them hairy. No, I mean fuck, Cranston is just as hairy. Close it. Like this. There you go. They're running late. That's for the best. Get ready for the shit storm coming your way. Fuck, man. Why did you bring me? We could drive to Veracruz and get shit-faced. I don't want to get shit-faced, or drive to Veracruz. You're the one who fucked up. Seriously, man? You made your bed, now lie on it. I fucked up, alright? I hurt her real bad but, c'mon I hope my Polski forgives me. Isa! Who's that with Roco? No fuckin' clue, bro. Is that Beto? Nah, he's at the beach with the others. So? - Anything else? - I'm good. What's up, fags? So nice of you to join us, Román. Shit's going to hit the fan, but I've got your back. Who's that? Just a friend. Go say hi, Romántic. Did you bring any gifts? Yeah, I'll show you later. Why the fuck did you bring him? I had to, nobody invited him to the beach. Fuck you. Also, you know, his best friend's missing. Brush your teeth, fuckin' wallaby. What the fuck? We could just leave. Maybe we can find a place to stay nearby. No. It's fine. Are you sure? Not really, but we're already here. What's up, shorty? How's it going, big guy? You're finally here! - Hi, Ren. - Hello, Roco. - What's up? - Nothing much. - Let me help you. - But... - It's fine. What's up? - Hi there. C'mon, follow me. Go give Óscar a hand with the beer. Isa, I'm glad you're here. What's your deal, man? What? I just wanna talk to him. Here's the thing. My cousins have a house in Veracruz... we can take turns driving and be there tonight. They don't want us here. - With Román? - Sure. - He won't like it. - Leave that to me, you in? - Sure. - Fuck yeah. Don't stay here, Ren. - Hold on, Polski. - Fuck you. Listen. What the fuck are you doing here? - I wanted to see you. - Well, I didn't. What's wrong with you? - Why did you bring him? - It wasn't me, it was Rodrigo. I have nothing to do with him, Polski. Listen to me. Listen. I haven't see him since that day. I've been trying to tell you that. Please, just listen. Don't touch me. What the fuck do you want? Haven't you done enough? Fuck off, Román! Isa, open the door! - Isa, open up. - Isabel. Everybody calm the fuck down. Nothing against him, but I didn't invite Román. I mean, I'm glad you're here. But don't blame me for this shit show. I'd like to think we can be mature about it so we don't ruin the whole weekend. Román? Sure, I guess. That's it then. We're out of beds, though. Right, Roco? I hadn't thought about that. I could sleep in your truck, Rodrigo. It's fine. Thanks, Óscar. Román sleeps downstairs and that's it. You won't get cold Valentina brought extra blankets. We cool then? Can we calm the fuck down? Shall we do this? Excellent. Follow me. There's a cool greenhouse just around the corner. Everything the light touches, in my kingdom. Let me help you with that, Ren. - It's fine. - Are you sure? - For real? - For real. - I'll just put it here. - Leave it. So, this is your room. If you need anything, I'm next door. The view is insane. I gave you this room so you can enjoy it. - Check it out. - That's nice. You'll enjoy it. Let me know if you need anything else. This mattress is not great, mine is better, just saying. Ren? Ren? What's up? What's up with everyone? I know, they're so extra. One down? Any new messages? Nope, nothing on Facebook either. I asked my mom, but she doesn't know. Juan Pablo runs away, but he always come back. I don't know. He's usually gone for one or two days and Óscar knows where he is. It's been two weeks. Are you ready, ladies? Gentlemen? Text your parents, tell them you're safe and tell them to fuck off. If you're ready, let me have your phones. C'mon. Give it to me, Romántic. Hold on. Give it to me! Son of a bitch! Where's your boyfriend? Fuck you. You already have a head start, man! It's OK, I'll catch up. Give me your phone. Awesome. So, welcome to our first, and probably last Spiritual, Emotional, Sensorial Retreat. Let's leave our phones for the weekend. - Rodrigo... - Don't interrupt me. Do we really need all this summer camp crap? Don't knock 'til you rock it. I mean, I just don't see it. He has a dumb face and talks like Goofy's gay cousin. Also, he's a pig. C'mon, that's gross. Some of us like to fuck things up. I mean, if I'm being objective he does have a nice ass. Especially on Friday, when he wears those shorts. What about the white sweatpants? Goddamn. Those shouldn't be legal. We made out once. Before or after Román? It was during. We were in a fight, last year. I mean, nothing hardcore. That's gross, Isabel. - You're more grossed out by Román. - Both of them. At least pick... Imanol. - I mean... - I MEAN! I didn't fuck Roco, I didn't even consider it. I don't like picking somebody else's trash. - That's why I came here. - I knew it. Give me some of that. It is working? No, man. This shit is cold, fuck! - Why didn't it start? - I don't know. Fuckin' shit. Move. What? - Since when do you smoke? - Don't start. Let's just get naked or something. Or play a game. Why didn't you tell me anything? Damn with you! Why! You could have told me something else not foolishness! Are you ready? Too much? It's not even the finals. Lewandowski is playing, baby! Let me see. Maybe I won't look so brown with this. Don't start. My uncles and my cousins are here. My grandma too. Really? Don't worry, they're gonna love you. - Come here. - What? What are you doing, big guy? I couldn't sleep, you? You didn't let me sleep. Are you hungry? Give me some of that pasta. It's good. You never thought about studying this? Gastronomy? Cooking? Nope. Now that you're going to be a famous animator our simple careers are not worth your time. Name one famous animator. - Steve Jobs? - Dumbass. I don't know, man. There are no famous animators. That shit sounds boring. As long as I'm far away from you. Fuck you, I always knew you hated me. Fuck off, Romántic. You're still mad at me for dating Isabel, did you? Where did that come from? I've always thought so. I was just thinking about that. There's nothing to forgive. You guys belong together. We do? Of course not. But you had a good run. Yeah but, I always knew you liked her. I even helped you give her gifts and faggy shit like that. And then I just fucked her, I didn't care. You were not mad? Of course I was. Why didn't you do something? - What for? - I don't know. To blow off steam, beat the crap out of me curse me out. Whatever, man. C'mon, Huguito! No, listen, man. You didn't take anything from me. My life would've been the same. Who knows? She cares about you, maybe out of pity, she... Cut the crap, Román Trejo. You're missing the point it's like we went to completely different schools. Don't forget that. SATURDAY What's up with these? They've been there for ages. My family is tone deaf, I don't even know. Maybe they came with the house. Thank you. Does it stink, like usual? No, Román! Stop! That's even worse! Fuck off! I don't know. I don't feel like doing something. I want to do nothing. What about your dad? What do you think? So? I don't know. I have to do something or my parents will kill me. - Well, my dad will. - Fuck, really? I really don't want to do shit. I want to lie on the grass, go to the beach poop in the ocean. Gross. You know what I mean? You go down to the kitchen, open the fridge and you forget about what you were looking for. You know it was important. Well, it feels like that. All the time. Slow down. Remember that fancy wedding I told about you? One of the waiters gave them to me. You had to suck his dick, didn't you? Fuck off, man, I'm serious. What about them? It's a new species they've been growing in Chiapas. I haven't tried them yet. Isn't that a bit too hardcore for these guys? Nah, dude. I'll bring them down add some water or something. You should've brought some acid, bro. You can't compare them, motherfucker! This shit's organic. Alright then, fuck it. If I'm fucked, at least let's enjoy it. You could use somebody else's piss. My dad is nuts. He might even want to watch me pee. I can't picture you studying Economics. Play with my butt. Or play with other Economists' butts. - Fuck you, motherfucker! - Where's the fuckin'fire? - Hurry the fuck up! - Fuck you, you bald piece of shit! - Fuck your shitty car! - Fuckin' faggots! You know what's the problem with this country? We need to compromise, that could solve everything. Half the people are in a hurry, and the other half isn't. Either we all assume everyone's in a hurry or nobody is, and we calm the fuck down but we all do, you know? Once you're 18, you're already the person you're going to be for the rest of your life. We may change a bit, but starting from what we already are. That's why I don't worry about you changing. I'll always look at you the same way. I always knew this would be temporary. Don't say that. It's fine. I didn't want you to feel lonely after Román. I've never been lonely. Where's your mascara, Isa? It's in my bag, the blue one! There's a green one. It's turquoise! - So, the green one? - That one! I haven't known you for long but I can't take you off my mind. Your eyes remind me of the ocean... That was great. Did you keep that record? I don't know where it is. I don't want to sound like a freak but I remember the exact day when I gave it to you. It's not that I still think of nothing crazy or anything. It was just a very peculiar day. And I like to remember those peculiar days. Are you alright? Not really. But that's how it is. Juanpi. Sometime I miss you. A lot. I mean, not you. I just want somebody to... I'm just checking for news, nothing else. Don't worry, I'd do the same. I doubt it. Maybe he's hiding with his childhood friends. He still sees them. - I'm sorry, Isa. - Shut up. - Shut up, Óscar. - Please, forgive me, I didn't mean to. I'm sorry. Whatever. We thank our sponsor, Imanol Delgado for this experiment of catharsis and celebration. It's not just about ‘doing drugs.’ Don't be so basic, Piotrowska. It's about sensory alteration through organic substances. This is my gift to you. I care about you. I really do. Are you getting emotional, Rodrigo Soto? Fuck yeah I am. Román! Román! You don't know how to swim! I wanted to paint with my fingers but my friend wanted to eat the paint. He threw up all over my drawing. And the teacher yelled at me. “Why didn't you stop him?” He should've stopped on his own. I'm cold. When will this be over? When we're economically and emotionally independent. When we pay our taxes, form a family and our own concept of home. Everything will be alright. Of course. I'm not feeling it anymore. Have you seen Isabel? No. Are you cold? Have you seen Isabel? I already told you, no. Do you want to change? I want Isabel. I know. Do you really know? Or just pretend to know? Are you OK? How could I be OK? I'm going to be OK, as soon as I'm OK. C'mon, Óscar. None of this is OK. Does this look OK to you? Are you OK? I'm never OK. OK then. Polski! Polski! Polski. Come here. I saw some things, Polski. - That's nice, isn't it? - I saw so many things. I know, Intense. You haven't called me that in years. - Let's go. - Hey. Forgive me. Don't start, Román. Hello? Dad? I don't know, dad. Monday, I think. I'll turn my phone on. Dad, listen. Let me know as soon as you know something. How's his mom? What? Dad. Hello? Dad! I remember the last time we rode together. This was the last time I got to I felt calm with you, remember? I don't know what happened between us. I don't know why you hurt me so much. I don't understand you. I don't understand. What? Nothing. I'll bring you some clothes. Whatever happens next if you even want something to happen I'm sorry. I like being with you in silence. Isa! Isa! Let me go, Román! - Román, wait! - Let me go, you piece of shit. What are you listening to? Nothing. I can turn it off. Are you cold? Oski? Oski! What are you doing, Rom? Hold on, man. I want too feel close. What do you want? What do you want from me? I want to stop getting headaches every time you're near. I don't want your voice to hurt me. I want to feel you inside me. Your voice hurts me, Oski. Did you bring condoms? You didn't bring some? I didn't know if you forgive me. I know where Roco keeps them. There we go. Just the one. Seriously? Alright then. Mood killer. How can you sleep here? Hold it. There it is. Yeah, that'll work. - Are you alright? - Yeah. - I missed your hair. - Shut up. I'm sorry I fucked up. Don't worry, I fucked up too. I was hooked on you, I couldn't help it. What are you talking about? I don't know, you? I'm sorry I came so fast. It's fine, don't worry. I can't leave you like that. Just relax. - That's not necessary. - Shut up and enjoy it. I give better blowjobs than her anyway. Let's see about that. SUNDAY What time is it, Oski? What time is it, cholito? I like it when you call me cholito. - Don't start, what time is it? - I don't know. Fuck, it's fuckin' late! - Isa is going to wake up! - What the fuck? She'll wake up and start looking for me. Fuck, man, just stay. - I can't. - Why would you fuck things up? I don't know, cholito. I'm sorry. Seriously, what the fuck is going on? I don't know, Oski, I'm sorry. Stay. I can't, Isa is waking up. I don't want to hurt her, or you. I don't want to keep fucking things up. See you later. Go on. Juanpi called you the Magnificent Seven. We were always making fun of your bullshit. I knew Isabel was screwing Renata before I was with Román. I knew Roco was fucking the French teacher even before they posted that video. That was so hot, man. Did you know Valentina blows professor Morán every Thursday around 4 o'clock? Fuck, I didn't know that. You didn't give a fuck about Juanpi. Now you feel sorry for him wishing you were his friend. Bullshit! He didn't give a fuck about the Magnificent Seven! Maybe you don't do it on purpose but you took advantage of Isa feeling blue. - Fuck you! - I'm just being honest. Fuck your honesty. You wouldn't be dating if they were still together. Maybe not right now but, eventually, who knows? It's not like they were going to get married. Not if they fucked around every time they fought. - Not only when they fought. - What? They were just starting to date and... What? You fucked Isa back then, you bitch? No, not Isa. Fuck off, Ren. Seriously? It was just once. We had just started high school, so... Fuck. What did Isa say? She never found out, I think. He never told her. And I'm not planning on telling her. And if you say something, I'll cut your balls off. So aggressive. What are you doing, Oski? What? What are you doing? Nobody invited us. It will be a short visit. If they want us to leave, we'll just go. On one condition. You're in no position to ask for conditions. You just had to say: what? At least say hi to Román. - Why? - C'mon, dude! You didn't care about Rubén's party last week. But as soon as Román throws one at his place: “Please, Juanpi! Let's go!”. Don't even start. He has a girlfriend, man. I know. Don't you think I know? Right. Somebody had to do it. If you start to get intense, we're out of here. When do I ever get intense? Hello. Hi, Mom. Yes, all right, we're here. And what happened? They found Juan Pablo. Did he suffer? No, I think it was fast. We all expected that, right? It's fine. Why are you crying, Isabel? Oski. For real, I want to know. Calm down, Óscar. I'm calm, I'm fine. C'mon, Isabel. You dated Juan Pablo when you were just kids. You can't use this to play the tragic victim. “My ex died, OMG, look at my fascinating life!” Fuck you, Isabel, goddamn! Are you alright, Isa? It's OK, sweetie, calm down. What's wrong, Isabel? Nothing. What's wrong? Isabel? Just let me go! He wanted to die, didn't he? I don't know, Óscar. You do know. You knew him. He fucked up, all by himself. I need to go see him. I need to go. I don't even know why I'm here. Why am I wasting my time with you? Hold on. - How are you going? - I don't know. I'll walk to the tollbooth and then I don't know. You're not making any sense. Let's just go in the morning. What part of “I can't stay” don't you understand? I should've been there, looking for him. But I came here. Because he didn't want me to let you go. Just another of his bad decisions. I'll come with you. I wanna see him too. But wait. You're kind of drunk. Me too. And it's getting late. If we're walking, let's do it in the morning. - Why am I even here? - You can't stay away from me. And neither can I, no matter how hard I try. - Did you find it? - It wasn't in Isabel's bag. But it should be here. Screw you guys. Why did you keep them? Who gives back a pencil? Juanpi collected them though. That's so gross. I mean, he nibbled on them. They're covered in spit. We could clone him. We have his DNA. I'm looking but, I can't find a picture of him. He wasn't even on MySpace or something? Óscar says he used to blog, but he delete it. You're not even looking! You're just seeing pics of the girls at the beach. I am looking. Maybe they posted something about Juanpi. Maybe they don't know yet. I don't think they care. Crap. I have no idea what was the last thing I said to Juanpi. I bet it was something dumb. I said hi, or asked him for a pencil. I like to keep track of what I say to people. Of our last exchange. Like with my aunt. I told you about it. I asked her to pass the pork chops. It's dumb, but it soothes me. I don't want to repeat what happened with Luis. Last time I saw my brother I cussed him out. He was a piece of shit. He made my life miserable, I was very young. He was ten years older. And he was the worst. And I still told him to go fuck himself. And they found his body that same night. I know he didn't die thinking I hated him. But it still sucks, you know? I wish I had asked him to pass me a steak change the channel, something dumb like that. Not to go fuck himself. So, I don't want to think about it. And your teen drama has me hooked. What's up with that? I fucked with Óscar last night. Fuck yeah, tiger. You think you're ready? What for? Dying? I don't think so, there's so much I want to do. I know. I bet Juanpi wanted to do things. I don't know. Maybe he knew he was going to die. That's what I mean, I'm not ready. To die a virgin? I'm joking, Hugo. - C'mon, Hugo! - What? Nothing. It's not that easy. What are you doing? Comforting you. I don't want fuckin' be there. You heard Hugo's mom. The police hasn't released his body. There's nobody to mourn. I don't want to be close to you. You're worse that human shit. Human shit? Animal shit fertilizes the soil but human shit just stinks, and it's useless. Wanna know the truth? I don't want to be alone. Stop provoking it. You wanna fuck just because you're lonely? Among other things. What? You're not coming? Wipe that idiot smile off your face. I'm not doing you any favor. I don't want to be alone either. You want a beer? Polski? Was that the last time? At least the last one I remember. Every time I think about us being happy I think about that. Two months later I fucked Óscar in the third floor toilets. And I had already made out with Renata. But I was happy. I was so happy. I would've loved to stay close to Juanpi share with him some of our happiness. Why are you here? Get the fuck out! - You want some? - No, dumbass, get out. No, wait. - C'mon, Ren. - What? You wanna stay? Seriously? Don't worry, I'm not really in the mood I'm just curious. - Just get out. - Let him stay. No, please. I wonder what the others are doing. Did you bring any condoms? I didn't know if you would forgive me. You want me to go get some? - I bet Roco packed a bunch. - I don't know. Román, don't! - You son of a bitch. - I know. No, wait, Román! I'm so sorry, Polski. Be careful. Are you alright? Fuck, cholito. Look at this shit. - That's nothing. - Son of a bitch. I could school you, but I can't right now. Fuck off. What are you doing? Stop, Isa find them. I've tried to show them to her, but she doesn't care. Are you going to show them to me? If you let me take some more. But only if you pull a boneless there. Boneless over there? Didn't you just see me fall on my face? Alright! But you gotta be naked! I will. Throw me my hoodie so it won't hurt as much! Calm down, motherfucker. - Fuck off! - You don't know what I'm doing. You're going to like it. Roco, focus! How are you doing that? With my tongue, do you like it? What? Do you like it? I don't know. Don't stop. You taste like ass. I want to be with you. What? MONDAY We'll go eat something, change clothes - and go to Juan Pablo's? - Are we sure it's tonight? The police just released the body to his parents. What about everybody else at the beach? Are they going? I don't think they even know about it. That sucks. They could've been here, in the woods roasting marshmallows and eating carrots. We forgot the vegetables when we bought the beer. Let's go, Rodrigo! What now? Studying Economics, I guess. And then? Who knows? Whatever, man. What are you doing? What the fuck are you doing? I'm singing you a song. Fuck off, man. Let's just go. My phone is dead, I need to call my dad ask about the mass, the funeral, let's go. I guess it's not a good time. What are you going to say? You forgive me? You fucked Isabel last night and now we're going steady? You want me to meet your parents? Well, not right now. Eventually. I don't know. No, Rom No, Román. That's not how it works. You're right, it's not a good time. Road trip, motherfuckers! If you need to think about it, that's fine I just want to be there while you think. Before thinking about how much I hate you I need to go bury my best friend. Is that OK? Sounds like a good plan. for my friends THESE PECULIAR DAYS
