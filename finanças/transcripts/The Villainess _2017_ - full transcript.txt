Who the fuck? What the?! Who is it? Eh? You came alone? Crazy bitch! You bitch! Hands up! We'll shoot! Freeze! Stay right there! "THE VILLAINESS" Park and his organization, whom we've been tracking, were all eliminated by this woman. Look! Who's he? We're still identifying him, but fortunately, he was only after the meth. Meth? Which means he took them without knowing anything. So what's the relation between the girl and him? We're currently investigating. Secure the hard drive no matter what! If that leaks, it'll be a bloodbath! And that girl... She could be an asset. No? Sook-hee, wake up! Sook-hee! Come back! Hey, stop! Hey, rookie! Stop there! Is that the new recruit? She's got some spirit. You were just like her. - Untamable. - Hey! Go easy, okay? You'll get out in time! It's getting interesting, don't try to stop her. Take it easy! You can't get out anyway! Do something! Open the door! To be! Or not to be! That bitch is also questionable. Where's the exit?! I know! Let me come with you! This way, go through here! What is this place? Answer me! There's no time for that, you have to jump! What? Or you can die here. There she is! Stop! Sir. Chief's charisma is something else today. Was she fished out of the prison? She took out an entire gang by herself. The one who'll get one of us assigned to her? Even if she's good in the sack and comes with a promotion, I can't live with her. Comes with a promotion? Damn, look at you. Gonna get a promotion and be our boss? Think you're up to it? Well, I'm good enough to take on the two of you. Listen to this prick. A relationship that comes with a promotion? It's win-win. They don't hand out those assignments freely. There've been many who've died trying. She's coming to. She's cute. She really is. The plastic surgery went well. Maybe it was nice to begin with. Unidentified Korean-Chinese Assassin Commits Suicide As of now, you do not exist. But we can resurrect you, if you choose to join our family. I don't want to live, you should have killed me. Kill me! Kill you? You can't die. What about your family? Do you think your baby also wants to die? Live. Even if only for your baby. What do you want from me? To live a normal life. A normal life? Give us 10 years, then you'll earn a pension and your freedom for the rest of your life. First, take a personality test and figure out a vocation. You'll become a sleeper cell and carry out missions. Once more... Wow, it looks nice! Can I try? Is it weird? Is there anything you're good at? Do you plan on rotting here for good? Shit! Where's the exit?! Tell me, before I kill Every last one of you! Go! Miss! Take me with you! I know where the exit is! Show me! Follow me! Why is she using that lame accent? She's useless. And you too. With that pretty face, how about acting? You killed an innocent man, and even children, who barely lived! The scariest thing in the world is seeing a body drained of life by your hands. These hands! These stains that won't wash off! Even should I remove the flesh, they'd remain! Go away! Scent of blood... Yes, dip this hand. Wash it. Flowing water can filter anything in the world. River, won't you wash my hands, and cleanse my vile corpse? Eun-hye, I'll protect you. It's okay. Peekaboo! Here. Peekaboo! Nice! Good job. Stop! Stop it, you'll kill her! Kim-sun! - Fine! Alright! - Come on! You've seen blood, that's enough. You'll kill her. Yo, Yanbian. I heard you're good with a sword. With the baby born, let's spar. Why you little! What the hell? I'm so scared. Maybe she really wants a go. Kim-sun! Fuck her up too! Sook-hee's no joke. Can you handle her? Hyun-soo's the only viable option for her. - Shut it. - Sorry. Happy birthday! Happy birthday! Happy birthday, dear Eun-hye! Happy birthday! Thank you. You can't let your baby live a life like yours. This tattoo... you won't believe how much I wanted it. Now I've become someone like you. Can't you tell me, who killed your father? I'm gonna kill him myself, I swear. That's the only reason I've stayed alive. Sook-hee! Stay away! Please! Sook-hee! It's all my fault! Stay back! Please! Sook-hee! Sook-hee! I told you to stay back! My darling, I feel terrible. I wasn't the one who killed your dad. What do you mean? We were like brothers, I couldn't do it with my own hands. Check it out. Begin! Do you still want to live? Then kill the girl before she kills you. That's the only way for you to live. You expect me to believe that? Begin! You died for the first time. Consider yourself dead, now live for me. Pay up, that's $50 each. That stupid bitch, all her training's wasted. Where's my wallet? Caugh it up. What's this? Sook-hee's favorite color, food, sleeping habits! Come on! Give it back! Number of toilet visits. Look at this guy. Gunning for that promotion, eh? I hope you don't get killed on your first mission. Why did you say that? That's bad luck. We're kidding around, don't get your panties in a knot. Don't get pissy! You got a thing for her? No, it's all about the promotion. We're here. It's your first mission. If you succeed, you get out. Who's the target? When I receive orders, I assign them. And you kill. Tell me if you're not ready, others are itching to go. Sook-hee, don't ever come out. Is this what you want? Take it. Boss! You know the White Oval that has been stolen? White Oval? This is it. It's a secret. My baby's up? Sweetie, isn't it pretty? What is this? When you get married, this'll be my present to you. I'm so jealous! Fuck! Where did he hide it? I should've asked him before they killed him. Where could it be? Where... Let me think... I heard you recently scored a big one. Fucking bitch! Shut your fucking trap! If that was true, I wouldn't be in this hell! Why do you always ask for more money? Where are you off to? Sook-hee! Sook-hee! Sook-hee! You bitch! Stop! Come here! Goddamn bitch! Who sent you? How much did he pay you? I'll pay 5 times! No, 10 times! One! Two! First 5 to reach HQ win! Run faster! Sook-hee! You were gonna leave without a goodbye? I'll be discharged soon, so get settled. You'll see her if she doesn't die before you leave. When you get out, call me. So melodramatic. It's a dossier on your new identity. (Chae Yeon-soo) Memorize it as if your life is depended on it. What's this? It's still a home, a framed photo is a must. I'm so sorry. Eun-hye, are you okay? Were you scared? Are you moving in today? Yes. With the surge in rent, I looked everywhere, and ended up here... But I'm not saying it's a bad neighborhood. It's close to a mountain, fresh air, and some great people too. That's pretty. Who gave it for you? Sweetie, would you like a candy? Eun-hye, I told you not to accept things from strangers. It's an expensive candy. Doesn't contain much sugar. You can have it. Let's go. Sweetie, stay on this side. Over here. What is it? My home... I live here. Are you in #407? We're neighbors? Moving in on the same day too? Are you moving in without your husband? Are you divorced? Overseas business trip. Business trip? On moving day? That's not right! Then why are you alone? My wife passed away a few years ago. It's okay, you didn't do it on purpose. I'm sorry. Let's go inside. One moment! Me? Pizza? Yes. Yes? What are you doing? I paid for that. What for? Pizza tastes great, but it's not nutritious for the kids. So I was thinking of making boiled chicken, if you like chicken... Do you like chicken? Good, that wasn't too bad. We're almost friends. What is it? Chief, I need a background check. Background check? There's a man next door, something's off. Okay, I'll look into it. Jung Hyun-soo Chief, how was I? Doesn't it look like she's into me? She asked for your background check. She did what? It's because you came onto her too hard. This is fieldwork. But she's at my doorstep. Don't joke around with background check. Here. Why do you have this? Are you from Yanbian? She was Korean-Chinese. How did you know? Nothing. Since we're neighbors, can I get your name? Yeon-soo, Chae Yeon-soo. I'm a 'soo' too. Pardon? Hyun-soo, Jung Hyun-soo. Chae Yeon-soo, Jung Hyun-soo. You're Yeon-soo, I'm Hyun-soo! 2 neighborsoo! How's chicken soo-p for dinner? Jung Hyun-soo, 33-year old, works at Daesung Corp., Development team, a widower of 3 years. Cause of death? Robbery, murder. What? She was pregnant at the time. He took 3 years off and started working recently, he sold their home and moved there. Does this go to Hyehwa station? That's what it says. So it does. I left my wallet at home... Just hop on, I won't charge you! For free? I need to buy lunch later too... And take a bus back home. I should run home. You can't even borrow money at work? No, I'm a loner. Bye. - Say bye to mom. - Bye-bye, mom. Rock, paper, scissors! Hyun-soo. Did you wait for me? I like it. What? I like to wait. Do you... like plays? Wait, are you... asking me out on a date? But you're married, you really shouldn't. Actually, I'm in a play. You're an actress? No wonder, you're so pretty. I'm the lead. Mommy! My princess! How did you know I was coming? She said it was time for you to come home, she was right on. Mommy, is he your boyfriend? Cobalt. After finding out that you're alive, I couldn't do anything. You still haven't changed a bit. I can't get it out of my head, your acting. Was it bad? Not at all! It was good. Really good! It feels like I get to become a different person, when I'm up on stage. That tie suits you. Oh... Yeah? It was a gift from my wife. My husband has a similar cobalt necktie. I gave it to him. I love this color. I wanted to tie it myself on our wedding day. Alright, boss. I got work in Seoul, so I'll head over first. Good, take care. You won't stay for the wedding? You'll be in Seoul for your honeymoon. I'll head over first and set things up. Mister, look at that! Not gonna eat? Let's live a normal life. Yes? What? I understand. Something wrong? Chun-mo's been kidnapped, go back to the hotel. I'll come with you. It's our honeymoon. Listen to me and head back. Yes? Joong-sang told me not to tell you. We tracked your father's real killer, and he asked me to take care of it. But when I was taken hostage, he tried to rescue me... Where are they? Tell me! I had so much fun today. I know it's wrong, but for a second, I wished you weren't married. Mrs. Chae? Yes, ma'am? Eun-hye is asleep, I got a feast to prepare, I have to go home. I'm almost there, could you wait a bit? Okay. Sir, could you stop the cab? There's still a way to go. It'd be awkward if your babysitter saw us together again. Hyun-soo! Go ahead. I have something to tell you. To be honest, my husband passed away. I already knew. But how? You're an amazing actress, but a terrible liar. I'm sorry. No, I'm okay. Don't answer. I'm sorry, it's an urgent call. Yes? A colleague got into an accident, and is en route to the hospital. Hyun-soo. Could you sleep here just for tonight? Eun-hye will be alone. Don't worry, be safe. Sook-hee! Min-ju! Why are you here? Isn't it obvious? I got my first mission. Your Southern accent is gone. Of course. When I discharge, I'll be living in Seoul. Seoul must be treating you well. You got a man? You do, don't you? Tell me! Of course not. You can't fool me. Hey. Why's the mood so weird? This is all wrong. I'll undress you. Very good. Drinking isn't the only thing I came here for. Come here, baby. Let me feel you. I think I'm drunk. What are you doing? One second. Why? Washroom... Come on, hurry up. Continue. Take that off, finish undressing. Did you take my phone? I'll return it, let her go. You must've made a copy. Give it. Fucking bitch! Min-ju, are you alright? Get her to the ER! She lost too much blood! Flash drive. - Start hacking. - Yes, ma'am. We can't do it here. Go to the ER! Let's head back. Min-ju'll die! She'll die like this! And why's that?! You should've done your job properly. Yeon-soo, you okay? Let it all out. Choi Chun-mo who emerged during this op, is known as a mid-level boss for a contract killer organization, and controls over 5 mid-size subsidiaries. Using data from our hard drive, Choi became a major player, and his pawn Sook-hee was recruited to the agency? Isn't that fishy? Wait a minute, then she's been a double agent? We've put an agent to watch her, and there haven't been any issues. Choi is someone who eliminated her husband to reach his level. Enough about his back story, we need to catch his puppet master. We've received intel that they'll contact HIN. We'll move in then. Why don't we assign her? Did you make mom cry? I... didn't... I consoled her. What does that mean? Consoling is, when you cry, I say "don't cry." Can you console mommy? What do you mean? When mommy cries, you say, "don't cry, don't cry." You're up? Sit down, food's getting cold. I'm full, and sleepy. Did she bug you? She said, I should console you whenever you cry. Can I do that? The me that you know isn't the real me. That's what I wanted to tell you. What? I'm not the person you think you know. I'm a terrible person. But if you're okay with that, I want to be by your side. No. If you knew the real me, you'd run away. No matter who you are, what you're into, I will never leave your side. Are you saying you want to get married? If I get killed, Eun-hye will be all alone. I'll reserve the wedding hall and hire some guests. Pardon? Will you do it yourself? Endure it. When she reaches junior high, you'll live a normal life. Hyun-soo, we can get married. You see? I told you your parents would approve it. Whatever happens, let's trust each other. Yes, I'll do that. I'll trust you from here on. Whatever happens, I'll trust you. You promise? You look like you've seen a ghost. I heard you were working in Japan. Why are you here? I heard you got Min-ju killed. You should've done a better job. It'd have been nice to have her here. A bride shouldn't frown, put on a smile. Chief wants me to send her a selfie. Chief Speak of the devil, it's the chief. Yes, chief. Put Sook-hee on. For you. Yes? Get to the washroom right away. There are parts of PSG-1 in the toilet. Through the fan, adjacent building 4th floor. Snipe the man in sunglasses. Shoot him! That man, who is he? You do not question the target. Miss, the ceremony is about to begin. Sook-hee! Sook-hee! Wait! You'll die if you go in. He wouldn't have wanted this. Without him, I can't go on. Don't cry. It's a good day. How could our dearest Sook-hee make a mistake like this? Shut it. Wrap it up and get out. Did you bring me in for this? Take out the target that she missed. Doesn't she look familiar? I'm not sure... Anything unusual about her? Her guests were paid off. Hired guests? Boss, maybe it's her second marriage. Maybe for him too. Both sides used hired guests. You still haven't changed a bit. No. I've changed. Please trust me once more. I know one thing for certain. We cannot exist in the same space. So long as you're alive, I cannot live. Yeon-soo. I gotta take this. Do you recognize me? Who are you? You may not know me, but I know you very well. People will soon love you, just as I do. Could you leave me alone? Do I offend you? My husband will be back soon. Didn't you love someone more than current husband? You must know a lot about actress Chae Yeon-soo. Yes. And I wish to know more. After losing the love of her life, she chose the stage to forget him. But he comes back from death and onto the stage. If she has to kill him in order to live, what would you do? If... that's the case... it'd be the saddest thing in the world. I'm sorry. I've mistaken you for a woman I loved. I'll leave you now. She's taking it hard after that mission. Why'd she make a mistake like that? She was ordered to kill on her wedding day, who wouldn't make that mistake? Don't confuse yourself, your marriage is your mission. Who... was the target? What? You alright? I'm fine. Mister. I can't wear... a bra with this dress, did you know that? What did you see just now? I sure did. If you promise to stay with me, I'll forget about revenge, and live a normal life. Revenge? Isn't that over? The one who killed my dad was someone else. Who was it? You met your target. It was a coincidence. He was a fan of the play. A coincidence? Was failing the mission a coincidence too? Don't forget what you're living for. Once you forget that, you and your family will be wiped away. Are you threatening me? No, I'm advising you. What is it? From a fan. Your greatest fan... What is it? Where are you going? I'm a guest actress. And also your understudy. She was ordered to kill on her wedding day, who wouldn't make that mistake? Don't confuse yourself, your marriage is your mission. Who was the target? Your greatest fan... A woman is coming to kill you. Don't move! Not a single step, assholes! You see this? If I press this, we're all dead! Kim-sun was taken by the target, stay on Sook-hee. She could be unpredictable. Is the target her ex-husband? Don't dig any deeper! He must die for her to live. Trust me, Hyun-soo. I'm off to Yanbian. What are you doing here? My mother's ill. I better go and look after her. Take care of Eun-hye while I'm away. Call me if anything happens. I doubt anything will happen. Because you're always looking after me. Yeon-soo, I love you. Sook-hee. Remember her? Send this. I wanted you to kill him. Then, you'd have lived happily with your husband and child. Now you're all in danger. My husband Jung Hyun-soo. The agency's lapdog. How could you belittle me like that? I asked for your permission to fucking marry him! Watch your mouth. Hostage exchange at midnight, Dongjin complex rooftop Jung Hyun-soo How did it go? I'll report to you by tomorrow. Chief, I can't reach Sook-hee, is something wrong? She's sick, she's at the hospital. What's wrong? Is it bad? Take care of Eun-hye. Head back home. Daddy's here! Daddy! How's my baby? Did you miss me? Are you okay? Sir? Sook-hee, are you okay? Mister! I have to rescue my child. Okay, we need to move. I'll go fetch her. Just in case, take this with you. Eun-hye, wake up. Sweetie, please. Open your eyes. Baby... Eun-hye! Sook-hee... Who did this? Who? Tell me! So this is what you meant by wiping us away? You still only believe what you've seen. It wasn't us, don't you get it? No more lies! If it wasn't you, who else would do this?! Daddy, hurry! Is it pee-pee? Let's go! Eun-hye. It's okay. Are you scared? So how's our reputation in Yanbian? Did you really have to do this to Sook-hee? What else? Watch her get her revenge on her father's killer? She loved Lee Joong-sang. So he married her, and even went on a honeymoon. She should've died then, just as we had planned. Now we have to kill her daughter too. She's Lee Joong-sang's child. - Yes, boss. - Lee Joong-sang! Lee Joong-sang! Yes, I understand. - Yes, sir. - Lee Joong-sang! No, sir, it's nothing at all. Tell him! Eun-hye's his daughter! Okay. Sook-hee was already pregnant when she arrived at the agency. I understand. He said he'll spare you. Should I do it? Fine, I'll do it. Jesus, you're quick. Hold still. Alright. Let's play. Daddy! Daddy! Daddy... Goddamnit... Gun, gun. Gun! It's all ready. So you'll spare me? Daddy, get up! Daddy, please! Yes, I can see her. Why're you doing this to me? Tell me! Killing me won't change anything. But I wish you two had met under different circumstances. Look. Chief. Can we get married for real? Agent Jung, get your shit together! Sook-hee is a woman who could die at any moment. But I love her. Sook-hee... She can't live with blood on her hands forever. I didn't want you to end up like me. Cease fire! Go check it out. Boss, we're out of ammo! Mister. Even for a split second, did you ever love me? Nothing we can say now, will change anything. I need to hear it, from your mouth. Sook-hee... I... loved you. But for the crime of killing your father, I couldn't love you anymore. Is that what you wanted to hear? You want to believe that. You can choose to live on believing that. How could you do this to me? I have that privilege. Because I made you. Let me show you. What you made me into. Boss! Boss! Cops are on the way! - Hurry! - Yes, sir! Come on! Hurry! Get off! What is it? Get off now! Get the hell off! Boss, hurry! Hurry up! Boss isn't here yet! Boss, please hop on! Please! Boss! Boss, come quick! Are you alright? What the fuck?! Get rid of her! Bitch! Sook-hee... Why are you shaking? Pathetic. Don't be scared. Don't be scared. Hit me! Kill me! That's when... it really begins. The real pain. Like the day I killed you. DIRECTOR JUNG Byung-gil "THE VILLAINESS"
