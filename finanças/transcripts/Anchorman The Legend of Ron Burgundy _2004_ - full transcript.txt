There was a time, a time before cable, when the local anchorman reigned supreme, when people believed everything they heard on TV. This was an age when only men were allowed to read the news. And in San Diego, one anchorman was more man than the rest. His name was Ron Burgundy. He was like a god walking amongst mere mortals. He had a voice that could make a wolverine purr, and suits so fine they made Sinatra look like a hobo. In other words, Ron Burgundy was the balls. l look good. l mean, really good. Hey, everyone! Come and see how good l look! Ribs. l had ribs for lunch. That's why l'm doing this. How now brown cow? How now brown cow? How now brown cow? How are you? You look awfully nice tonight. Maybe don't wear a bra next time. No, l was talking to you. No, not her. l don't know her name. What is it? Lanolin? Lanolin? Like sheep's wool? Unique New York. l love scotch. l love scotch. Scotchy-scotch-scotch. Here it goes down. Down into my belly. The arsonist has oddly shaped feet. How much time? 30? 30 seconds? -You are on. -l'm on right now? l don't believe you. Ron! Oh, come on. Audrey. l look like hell. l got bags under my eyes. What's that? lf you were a man, l'd punch you right in the mouth. That's bush. Bush league. The Human Torch was denied a bank loan. You hear me? Audrey, look at me! l'm sorry. All right? l'm sorry. All right, we're on. Ready, Phil. We're on in five, four... When the clock struck 6:00, it meant one thing for Ron Burgundy and his news team: Go time. Channel 4 News, with five-time Emmy award-winning anchor Ron Burgundy. Champ Kind, sports. Brick Tamland, weather. And your reporter in the field, Brian Fantana. lt's Channel 4 News at 6:00. Good evening. l'm Ron Burgundy, and this is what's happening in your world tonight. A La Jolla man clings to life at a university hospital after being viciously attacked by a pack of wild dogs in an abandoned pool. Hey, everybody! Shut the hell up! Ron Burgundy's on! Authorities are still uncertain as to why the man was loitering... Ron Burgundy. Oh, my gosh! She said her first words! Right now it's 82 degrees in our fair city, and compare that to 48 degrees in the upper Northwest and 38 degrees in the Middle East. Off the coast of Tampa Bay yesterday, one lucky cameraman happened to catch an unusual aquatic daredevil. What you're about to see is a Channel 4 News exclusive. His name is Nutty the Squirrel, and he's three years old. How about that? That squirrel can water-ski. -Man, that's hilarious. -Yeah, that's good. For all of us here at News Center 4, l'm Ron Burgundy. You stay classy, San Diego. Listen up. The ratings just came in for last month. We are number one. We just grabbed every key demographic. -Super-duper, gang! -Yeah! Yeah! Super-duper! That's nice! Way to go! Neat-o, gang. -Yes! -Boy, Ed. That is good news. l gotta be honest. -Congrats, congrats. -That is good news! -All right! -Stick around. Make sure these guys don't party too much. -They don't really ever listen to me, Ed. -Just get it done. Ladies and gentlemen, can l please have your attention? l've just been handed an urgent and horrifying news story. l need all of you to stop what you're doing and listen. Cannonball! Yes, these fellas were a real news team. Burgundy, of course, was the foundation, the rock. But each member brought their own special something to the equation. People call me the Bri-Man. l'm the stylish one of the group. l know what you're asking yourself, and the answer is yes, l have a nickname for my penis. lt's called the Octagon. But l also nicknamed my testes. My left one is James Westfall, and my right one is Dr Kenneth Noisewater. You ladies play your cards right, you might get to meet the whole gang. Back booth there at Charlie Lancer's every Friday night. Champ here. l'm all about having fun. You know, get a couple of cocktails in me, start a fire in someone's kitchen. Maybe go to SeaWorld, take my pants off. Anyway, l've become kind of famous for my signature catchphrase, "Whammy!" As in, "Gene Tenace at the plate and whammy!" Whammy! l'm Brick Tamland. People seem to like me because l am polite and l'm rarely late. l like to eat ice cream, and l really enjoy a nice pair of slacks. Years later, a doctor will tell me that l have an lQ of 48 and am what some people call "mentally retarded." Hello! -Marco! -Polo! -Brian. -You having a good time? -l'm having a great time. -That makes two of us. You've gotta meet this girl. She used to be a Charger cheerleader, but she broke her pelvis. Sherri, meet Ron Burgundy. -Hey, Ron. -Hello. l've got a big story for you. And it's right here. Well, hello. You pointed to your boobies. Oh, my God, you did! -Ron Burgundy? -Yes? l have had a crush on you since l was a little girl. Let's go somewhere. l'm telling you, it don't get no better than this. We've been coming to the same party for 1 2 years, and in no way is that depressing. By the beard of Zeus! Excuse me. Ron, where you going? What, are you crazy? Ron! lf you're coming down the baseline, you gotta take home plate from me! So there l go, head first, boom! l've lost her. Hello. Hope l'm not disturbing you, but l saw you from across the party, and l don't usually do this, but l felt compelled to tell you something. You have an absolutely breathtaking heinie. l mean, that thing is good. l want to be friends with it. Well, you certainly know how to compliment a woman. Now, if you'll excuse me. Do you know who l am? No, l can't say that l do. l don't know how to put this, but l'm kind of a big deal. Really? People know me. l'm very happy for you. l'm very important. l have many leather-bound books, and my apartment smells of rich mahogany. l mean... That sounded stupid. No, no, that's very exciting. Listen, can l... Can l start over again? Sure. l wanna say something. l'm gonna put it out there. lf you like it, you can take it. lf you don't, send it right back. l wanna be on you. Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. l... l wanna be on you. Baxter! Papa's home. There he is. There's my little man. You're okay? Of course l met a lady tonight. This one was different. l have to be honest. Quite different. What? l'm lonely? l'm not lonely! l'm beloved by everyone in San Diego. Wow. You know how to cut to the core of me, Baxter. You're so wise. You're like a miniature Buddha covered in hair. Come again? You know l don't speak Spanish. ln English, please. You pooped in the refrigerator? And you ate a whole wheel of cheese? How'd you do that? l'm not even mad. That's amazing. l forgive you. What do you say we get you in your PJs and hit the hay? Bedtime. Okay, come on. Let's go. Come on. Oh, that was one crazy party. l am hung over. l woke up this morning in some Japanese family's rec room, and they would not stop screaming. Yeah, l ate a big, red candle. All right, guys. Let's focus up. Morning, everyone. Here are the stories we're going to be chasing today. lt looks like Ling Wong, the rare panda at the San Diego Zoo, is pregnant. This is a big one. This could be the big story of the summer. Network is gonna be wanting plenty of coverage. And speaking of network, word on the street is they're looking for a new anchor. -So, Ron... -Network? Are they here? A lot of you have been hearing the affiliates complaining about a lack of diversity on the news team. What in the hell's diversity? Well, l could be wrong, but l believe Diversity is an old, old wooden ship -that was used during the Civil War era. -That's right. l would be surprised if the affiliates were concerned about the lack of an old wooden ship, but nice try. Diversity means that times are changing, and with that in mind... -Ron, are you paying attention? -Nope. -This concerns all of us. -Okay. Keeping that in mind, l'd like to introduce the latest addition to the KVWN News Team, directly from WYPN in Asheville, North Carolina, Ms Veronica Corningstone. Hello. Hello, everyone. l just want you all to know that l look forward to contributing to this news station's already sterling reputation. l mean, come on, Ed! lt's bull crap! Don't get me wrong. l love the ladies. They rev my engine, but they don't belong in the newsroom! lt is anchorman, not anchorlady! And that is a scientific fact! l don't know what we're yelling about! -Ron, what do you think? -She... lt's terrible! She has beautiful eyes, and her hair smells like cinnamon! Loud noises! All right, everyone relax. She's not gonna take anyone's airtime. l read somewhere that their periods attract bears. Bears can smell the menstruation. Well, that's just great. You hear that, Ed? Bears. Now you're putting the whole station in jeopardy. l will say one thing for her, Ed, she does have a nice, big old behind. l'd like to put some barbecue sauce on that butt and just bite, bite, bite, bite, munch, munch, munch! Stop it! Oh, jeez. Look at the full-moon butt! Champ! Champ! Champ, Champ! Mr Harken, l was just wondering if you knew when my office would be ready. Well, that might take some time. For now, why don't you just grab a desk in the bullpen? You can use my office! Then afterwards maybe we can go to lunch! Lower your voice, Ron. All right. Thank you, Mr Harken. l'll go get my desk set up. She is a saucy mama! l mean, l would... Here we go again. Every station, it's the same. Women ask me how l put up with it. Well, the truth is, l don't really have a choice. This is definitely a man's world. But while they're laughing and grab-assing, l'm chasing down leads and practising my non-regional diction. Because the only way to win is to be the best. The very best. Touchy situation. l think the best thing to do with this Corningstone, to keep her in line, is bed her quick. That behind is driving me loco! l'm like a night wolf. Guys, take it easy. Just take it easy! -She's got feelings, too. -Oh, my God! Listen to Burgundy. He's gone soft on us, like some schoolboy bitch. You sound like a gay. Hey! Come on! lt's me, Papa Burgundy, all right? As far as l'm concerned, Corningstone's fair game. Let the games begin! There he is. There he is. l'm very aroused. What's this? Well, well, well. Ron Burgundy and the Channel 4 News Team. Hello, Wes Mantooth. Hello, Evening News Team. Nice clothes, gentlemen. l didn't know the Salvation Army was having a sale. Am l right? Look at these guys. Hey, where did you get those clothes? At the toilet store? What are you doing on our station's turf, Burgundy? You're about to get a serious beat-down. l will smash your face into a car windshield and then take your mother, Dorothy Mantooth, out for a nice seafood dinner and never call her again! Dorothy Mantooth is a saint! You understand me? -Dorothy Mantooth is a saint! -Hey. Leave the mothers out of this, all right? lt's unnecessary. Besides, l'm sure Wes here is just upset over finishing second in the ratings again. That's completely uncalled for, Burgundy. You know those rating systems are flawed. They don't take into account houses that have more than two television sets and other things of that nature. l guess l have to take you at your word, Number Two. You have a great day, fellas. We'll see you around the bend. Son of a bitch! Excusez-moi, Numéro Two. Hey, Burgundy. You know those sample audiences aren't big enough! Stop hiding behind those phoney numbers, Burgundy! l'm coming after you! l hate you, Ron Burgundy. l hate you! You can't say one word? Even the guy who can't think says something! You guys just stand there? Come on! Right, but l think my son is just going through a phase. l have no idea where he would have gotten a hold of German pornography. But you and l are mature adults. We've both seen our share of pornographic materials. Oh, you never have? Of course you haven't, how stupid of me. Neither have l. l was just speaking in generalities. l'll stop by the school a little later, Sister Margaret. Bye. Ed, she insisted on coming in. Mr Harken, sir, l will not have my first story at this news station be about a cat fashion show. Miss Corningstone, ma'am, you will do the stories to which you are assigned. Mr Harken, l am a damn good journalist, and this cat show thing is grade-A baloney. lt is not baloney. Now, go do your job, missy! lt is baloney! Hey, Ron, l'm gonna take a run at the new girl. Let the games begin. Champ, Champ, we're not really gonna actually do that. -We were just flapping our gums. -Oh, yeah. You kill me, Burgundy. Let me just grab this. Sorry about that. Whammy. -Champ? -Yeah. You're trying to touch my breasts, aren't you? What can l say? l like the way you're put together. What do you say we go out on a date? Have some chicken, maybe some sex. You know, see what happens? Let me get this over here. Sorry. There it is. l'll give this little cookie an hour before we're doing the no-pants dance. Time to musk up. Wow. lt never ceases to amaze me. What cologne you gonna go with? London Gentleman, or... Wait. No, no, no. Hold on. Blackbeard's Delight. No, she gets a special cologne. lt's called Sex Panther, by Odeon. lt's illegal in nine countries. Yep, it's made with bits of real panther. -So you know it's good. -lt's quite pungent. Oh, yeah. lt's a formidable scent. lt stings the nostrils. -ln a good way. -Yep. l'll be honest with you. That smells like pure gasoline. They've done studies, you know. 60% of the time, it works every time. -That doesn't make sense. -Well... Let's go see if we can make this little kitty purr. Hey, sweet cheeks. Got an invite l'd like to extend your way. My God. What is that smell? That's the smell of desire, milady. God, no, it smells like... Like a used diaper filled with lndian food. Excuse me. Desire smells like that to some people. What is that? Smells like a turd covered in burnt hair! lt smells like Bigfoot's dick! Oh, hell, that's rank! What's that smell? This is worse than the time the raccoon got in the copier. Yeah. lt's very distracting. -When we get to the pet shop... -Cough! Look over here. Excuse me, Veronica. Yes, what is it, Brick? l would like to extend to you an invitation to the pants party. Excuse me? The party. The pants... With the pants. Party with pants? Brick, are you saying that there's a party in your pants and l'm invited? That's it. Did Brian tell you to say this, Brick? No... Yes, he did. Okay. No, l don't want to go to a party in your pants. Very well. lan? Would you like to go to a party in my pants? No, Brick. All right. Let's go! All right, now... lt's all right! l'm all right! l'm telling you, she is a real ball-buster. A real ice queen. l just burned my tongue. The only way to bag a classy lady is to give her two tickets to the gun show and see if she likes the goods. One thousand one, one thousand two. -Mr Burgundy? -One thousand three. Helen said that you needed to see me? Miss Corningstone. l wasn't expecting company. Just doing my workout. Tuesday's arms and back. -You asked me to come by, sir. -Oh, did l? Yes. Oh, it's the deep burn! Oh, it's so deep. l can barely lift my right arm 'cause l did so many. l don't know if you heard me counting. l did over 1 ,000. You have your ubulus muscle that connects to the upper dorsinus. lt's boring, but it's part of my life. l'm just gonna grab this shirt, if you don't mind. Just watch out for the guns. They'll get you. You are pathetic. This has to be the feeblest pickup attempt that l have ever encountered. l expected it from the rest of them, Mr Burgundy, but not from you. Wait a minute! l... Pickup attempt? l'm offended. l have little time to get to the gym, so l have to sculpt my guns at the office. Stop calling your arms "guns." Look. My plan was to ask you if l could squire you about town as one professional helping another professional, because l know what it's like to be lonely in a new city. -Really? -Yes. But now l am too hurt. And shocked and offended and hurt. l could do that. -Really? -Well, yes. As a journalist, l should get to know the city that l'm covering. -But this is not a date. -No, of course not. -Strictly professional. -Wonderful. Great. So l pick you up... 8:00? 9:00. Downstairs? Mr Burgundy, you have a massive erection. Really? Yes, l do. l'm sorry, it's the... lt's the pleats. lt's actually an optical illusion. lt's the pattern on the pants. lt's not flattering in the crotchal region. l'm actually taking them back right now. Taking them back to the pants store. This is awkward. l will see you later. Yes. l'm taking a... Nothing to look at. Don't act like you're not impressed. Frame up two. -Let's go to Brian Fantana live... -Gimme a tighter one on two. ...with a Channel 4 News exclusive. Brian? Panda watch. The mood is tense. l have been on some serious, serious reports, but nothing like this. Ching... King is inside now. l tried to get an interview, but they said, "You can't. "He's a live bear. He will literally rip your face off." Hey! You're making me look stupid! Get out here! Panda jerk! Great story. Compelling and rich. That's gonna do it for all of us at Channel 4 News. You stay classy, San Diego. l'm Ron Burgundy? Damn it! Who typed a question mark on the teleprompter? For the last time, anything you put on that prompter, Burgundy will read. Oh, God, this is a mistake. This is a mistake. He's very cute. Very cute. No, he's not. He's hairy. There she is! Veronica! My little china doll. -l am full of it tonight. -Oh, silly. Hi. You look ravishing. lt truly is beauty and the beast. l might add a handsome beast at that. Are you ready for our rendezvous? -lt's not a date. -No, strictly professional. Doesn't mean we can't have fun. -Shall we? -Yes. San Diego. Drink it in. lt always goes down smooth. What a beautiful view, Mr Burgundy. l know. l love this city. lt's a... lt's a fact. lt's the greatest city in the history of mankind. Discovered by the Germans in 1 904. They named it San Diago, which of course, in German, means a whale's vagina. No, there's no way that's correct. l'm sorry. l was trying to impress you. l don't know what it means. l'll be honest. l don't think anyone knows what it means any more. Scholars maintain that the translation was lost hundreds of years ago. Doesn't it mean Saint Diego? No. No. No, that's what it means. -Really. -Well, agree to disagree. May l take your order? Yes, l am going to have three fingers of Glenlivet with a little bit of pepper, and some cheese. Very good. A Manhattan, and kick the vermouth in the side with a pair of steel-toed boots. -Certainly. -Thank you, Scott. Thank you. Wow. Quite a drink order. Well, when in Rome. Yes? Please, go on. Do as the Romans do? -lt's an old expression. -l've never heard of it. lt's wonderful, though. Mr Burgundy. -Tino! How are you? -So good to see you. You're looking fantastic. Tino, Veronica. Veronica. What a pretty girlfriend. -Drinks are on Tino tonight. -No, no, no. We're work associates. l work at the station. -l'm a journalist. -Oh, okay. This is a good guy. Tino's the finest club owner in the city. -My best friend, right? -Yes. Yes, we have a saying in my country about people like him. "The coyote of the desert "always likes to eat the heart of the young, "where the blood drips down to children for breakfast, lunch and dinner, "only the ribs will be broken in two." -Tino. -Okay. Well, Mr Burgundy, we will be honoured if you will play jazz flute for us. -l can't. -Please. You play jazz flute? l dabble. Would everyone love to hear Ron Burgundy play jazz flute? -Get it going, Ronnie! -Yes! Please. You, on stage now. Okay, l guess l can play a little ditty. -Honestly, l'm... -Come on. -Give him a hand. -l'm not prepared. Not at all. -Yeah! -This is a surprise, l'll tell you. Guys, East Harlem Shakedown, E-flat? Keep the cymbals splashy, and, Jay, let's take the bass line for a walk. Hold on. l'm not hearing it right. Hold on. -We got it now. lt's all right. -Fire up, Ronnie! Little Ham and Eggs coming at you. Hope you got your griddles. That's baby-making music, that's what that is. Let's go! Hey, Aqualung! Thank you. Thank you! -You were amazing. -Thank you. Where did you learn to play like that? Well, jazz flute has always been a small passion of mine. So what other passions do you have, Mr Burgundy? Well, l have one great passion that... That lives deep within my loins, like a flaming golden hawk. To one day become a network anchor. Well, believe it or not, we share the same dream. l too want to be a network anchor. God, you are so beautiful. We really should be going. l swore that l would never get involved with a co-worker. Wait. What if, just for tonight, we weren't co-workers? We were co-people? l don't... You be a woman. l'll be a man. That's all. You continue to surprise me, Mr Burgundy. l'm storming your castle on my steed, milady. Wait, stop. Stop talking like that. -l can't understand you. -Sorry. Take me to Pleasure Town! Oh, we're going there! l frigging love you! l frigging love you back! Look! The most glorious rainbow ever! Do me on it! Well done, sir. Tip of the cap to you as well, Miss Corningstone. l'm having very strong feelings for you, Mr Burgundy. But it's very important to me that l be viewed as a professional. Right. When in Rome. Yeah. That expression doesn't really apply to what l'm talking about. What l was saying. l still don't quite understand what it means. Oh, no. You'll find it. No, l was saying that, if we continue seeing each other, that we should keep it relatively quiet around the station. Absolutely, my wild love tigress. Tasteful discretion is the name of the game. Veronica Corningstone and l had sex, and now we are in love! Did l say that loud? Yeah, you pretty much yelled it. Well, l can't help it. lt's fantastic! -What's it like, Ron? -The intimate times? Outta sight, my man! No. The other thing. -Love. -Yeah. What is that? Well, it's tough to explain. -l think l was in love once. -Really, what was her name? l don't remember. That's not a good start, but keep going. She was Brazilian. Or Chinese, or something weird. l met her in the bathroom of a Kmart, and we made out for hours. Then we parted ways, never to see each other again. -l'm pretty sure that's not love. -Damn it! l love carpet. l love desk. Are you just looking at things in the office and saying you love them? l love lamp. Do you really love the lamp, or are you saying it because you saw it? l love lamp! l love lamp. You really want to know what love is? -Yeah. -Yes, tell us. More than anything in the world. Well, it's really quite simple. lt's kind of like... You guys have it, l think. l don't know, Ron. That sounds kind of crazy. Sounds like you have mental problems, man. -Yeah, you got mental problems, man. -Yeah, he really does. Man. -Wanna make a phone call. -Freshen this up. Oh, look out. Next up, it's Whiskerus Maximus. He's ready to do battle in the arena against the tiniest lion you've ever imagined. l'm getting some great stuff, Miss Corningstone. Shut up. l hate cats. Let's just do my sign-off and get out of here. lt was quite a show down here at the Pet Shack. Just for today, fashion curiosity did not kill the cat. l'm Veronica Corningstone for Channel 4 News. That was our newest reporter, Veronica Corningstone. She's really great. l'd also like to share with you that we are currently dating and that she is quite a handful in the bedroom. That's gonna do it for all of us here at 6:00. For the Channel 4 News Team, l'm Ron Burgundy. You stay classy, San Diego. All clear. l might be in trouble on that one. l can't believe that you said that we were dating on the air. That is good fondue. Don't you get it, Ron? l wanna be an anchor. That is never gonna happen if everyone in San Diego thinks that l'm your bimbo gal pal. l don't know what to say. l just... l got excited. l just wanted to shout it from on top of a mountain. But l didn't have a mountain. l had a newsroom and a camera. Look. l report the news. That's what l do. And today's top story, in Ron Burgundy's world, read something like this, l love Veronica Corningstone. Oh, Ron. This is nice, gang, sitting here. -Oh, yeah. -Brown bagging it. The team pancake breakfast is tomorrow morning at 9:00 instead of 8:00. Almost forgot. l won't be able to make it, fellas. Veronica and l are trying this new fad called jogging. l believe it's jogging or yogging. lt might be a soft "J." l'm not sure, but apparently you just run for an extended period of time. -lt's supposed to be wild. -So Ron's not coming? No, Ron's coming. lt's the pancake breakfast. We do it every month. l realise that. Sometimes you gotta look yourself in the mirror and say, "When in Rome." The bottom line is, you've been spending a lot of time with this lady. You're a member of the Channel 4 News Team. -That's a given. -We need you. Hell, l need you. l'm a mess without you. l miss you so damn much. l miss being with you. l miss being near you. l miss your laugh. l miss your scent. l miss your musk. When this all gets sorted out, l think you and me should get an apartment together. Just take it easy, Champ. Why don't you stop talking for a while? Maybe sit the next couple of plays out. You know what l mean? Yeah, l'm gonna quit saying things when they crop up in the old skull, huh? See what it's like when you're not here? You're our leader. Look what you're doing to the group. Champ's been a mess. Brick can't sleep at night. Here's the thing, l don't trust this chick. We need you around, and she is just using you. Everyone, just relax. All right? Believe me, if there's one thing Ron Burgundy knows, it's women. l don't know, Ron. Guess what? l do. l know that one day, Veronica and l are gonna get married on top of a mountain. And there's going to be flutes playing and trombones and flowers and garlands of fresh herbs. And we will dance till the sun rises. And then our children will form a family band. And we will tour the countryside, and you won't be invited! l'm telling you, this lady has really crawled into Ron's head. Good. Good one! Okay. l understand. You have a nice day, sir. Bye. l could come back later, Mr Harken. No, no, no. lt's just parent stuff. lt seems that our youngest, Chris, was on something called "acid" and was firing a bow and arrow into a crowd. -You know how kids are. -Right. Anyhoo, what can l do you for? Well, Mr Harken, l feel like l have proven myself as a journalist and that l deserve the opportunity to take on more challenging stories. Well, ask and you shall receive. Yes, this just came across my desk. Here is a story of a 1 03-year-old woman out in Chula Vista who claims to have a recipe for the world's greatest meatloaf. Now that's a hot lead. lt was very hard for Veronica. But she was a pro and hung tough. But soon, with a simple act of littering, everyone's life would change forever. Baxter, you are my little gentleman l'll take you to foggy London Town Because you are what My little gentleman This burrito is delicious, but it is filling. Antony and Cleopatra! Goddamn son of... What the hell, bro? Hello, neighbour. Did you just throw a burrito out your window? l believe l did. Are you high or something? Did you see what happened? l did. That was a terrific little spill. That's quite a raspberry. That's my chopper you just thrashed, Broseph. Easy, compadre. l'm your friend out here, all right? l want you to fix my chopper before l stomp your goofy ass! lf you want to throw down, fine. l've got Jack Johnson and Tom O'Leary waiting for you. You destroyed the only thing l love. All right? There it is. What do you love? l love poetry. And a glass of scotch. And, of course, my friend Baxter here. Well, guess what. Now this is happening. Excuse me. Excuse me. What are you doing? That's how l roll. Baxter! No! -Where the hell is he? -He'll be here. -l thought he was Mr Dependable. -lt's not like Ron. l'd put Brick on, but unless he's tracking a storm front, he's useless. -Excuse me, gentlemen. -Hello. Just want you to know if Ron does not show up, l am ready to go on. You and l have had this discussion a million times. There's never been a woman anchor. Mr Harken, this city needs its news. You're gonna deprive them of that because l have breasts? Exquisite breasts? l am gonna go on, and if you want to stop me, bring it on. Because l am good at three things, fighting, screwing and reading the news. l've already done one of those today, so what's the other one gonna be? Screwing? l will be in makeup. Jesus, she's terrifying! Fantana. -Ron, are you okay? -The man punted Baxter! Calm down. Breathe, Ron, breathe. -The man that loved the motorcycle! -What did the bad man do?

He wants me back. But l can't do this without my news team. l don't know, Ron. That was half a lifetime ago. We're different people now. When you left, the hurt was so deep. l don't know if l can go through that again. Think about what you're asking. ...man. Gentlemen, there was a time when you called me your lead anchor. Will you follow me again? l'm getting too old for this shit. To the news van! -To the news van! -Okay! Well, l'll be. Ron Burgundy. He's back!

Ron, l don't want to sound cruel, but... There's a network talent scout over there. This is a tough decision. So much to think about. Basically the biggest story of my career, launching me to a level l've never known before, or saving the woman l used to have familiar relations with. This is hard! l am in a pickle! Ron, l know it sounds harsh, but God does not want her to live. No. Hold on. lt's clear now. We go into the bear pit. Ron, don't. l immediately regret this decision. What are you doing? Why didn't you get help? These bears are massive! They looked a lot smaller from up there. Fan out. Let's go find Harken. Stay calm. lt's all right. l think it's all right, my sweet chinchilla. -Oh, Ron. -Yes, yes. ln case we die here today, there's something that you should know. That dirty trick with the teleprompter, it wasn't... Sweet Eli Whitney's nose! lt wasn't you, was it? lt was Wes Mantooth. -l should have known. -No, no. -No, l did it. -You bitch! You woke the bears. Why did you do that? There's somebody in the bear pit! lt took my impending death for me to realise how much l need you. Oh, Ron. Those bears are gonna hurt them! News team, let's hunt. News team! Bear fight! Come on. Come on! Damn! Hit them in the uvula! Hey, Ron! l'm riding a furry tractor! The bears have descended on the news team and it's not going well. Clearly, after today, l will no longer... Come on! Oh, God! lt's getting to be ri-goddamn-diculous! Oh, no. We woke up the mama. Oh, God! l don't wanna die. Ron! ! ! Baxter! Leave these people alone. They mean you no harm. We Bears are a proud race. They must pay for their intrusion. ln my travels l met one of your kind. His name was Katow-jo. We became friends. Katow-jo is my cousin. Go in peace. l will tell tales of your compassion. Fare thee well, Baxter. You shall always be friend of the bears. -Look! They're following their mother! -lt's instinct. Oh, Baxter!

But in order to properly retell it, l'm going to need some help from my co-anchor, Miss Veronica Corningstone. -High-pressure system... -No, no, no, no, Brick. -High-pressure system... -Go stand over there. Oh, Ron. Ron, there are literally thousands of men that l should be with instead, but l am 72% sure that l love you. Yes, redemption was sweet for Ron Burgundy. Yes! Ron! -As for the news team... -Stop it! Ron! Champ Kind went on to become a commentator for the NFL, but was later fired after being accused of sexual harassment by Terry Bradshaw. Excuse me. ls that Sex Panther you're wearing? Brian Fantana went on to have great success as the host of the hit reality TV show lntercourse lsland on the FOX Network. Anyone seen Brick? -Brick? -Don't! That tickles! No, that tickles me! Come on! Brick Tamland is married with 1 1 children and is one of the top political advisors to the Bush White House. l'm gonna get you! l'm gonna get you! Hey! ls she going to live with us?

Sweet grandmother's spatula! Hot pot of coffee! Uncle Jonathan's corncob pipe! l'm gonna shoot you with a BB gun when you're not looking. ln the back of the head. l'm sorry. You're not very bright. You know that, right? You're actually quite a dullard. Everyone here knows it. lf l'm a dullard, you're the dull... Can't think of anything to say, can you? Yes, l can. l can think of a lot of things to say. Like, you're a dirty bitch. Well, Ron, l'm gonna put poison... Oh, my God! l drank a lava lamp. lt wasn't lava. l ate a whole bunch of fibreglass insulation. lt wasn't cotton candy like that guy said. My stomach's itchy. l pooped a hammer. l pooped a tape recorder. l pooped a Cornish game hen. Nope. You do not take a tone with me, 'cause l will give you a rap right on the Jack Johnson! -Okay. -Yes. Now this is happening. What are you doing? What are you doing? What are you... Action. We'll go back to doing what l do best... l guess we'll go back to doing what l do best, show off. -When do we get started? -When do we get started? -That's my line. -When do we get started? You say, "Whenever you like." Whenever you like. Keep it rolling. This is good stuff. ...an area bank in a daring... Probably not the same one. Probably not the same guy. Brick, before l let you go, are you still having your celebrity golf tournament this summer? No, too many people died last year. So we're not gonna do... Sorry. Sorry. They named it San Diego. Which in German means a whale's vagina. This is the most ridiculous thing ever. Way to handle him. That was nice. lt sure is good to be number one. lt sure beats the hell out of number two. We are laughing! And we are very good friends. Good buddies sharing a special moment. Don't say anything, Ron. Just let it happen. We're laughing, enjoying our friendship. And someday we'll look back on this with much fondness. Yeah.
