A CLOD OF CLAY When we move a wide object across our face, we feel something cold touching our cheek. This is the air! Uncle Nichifor... Not bad, not bad! Please come back! But you really got them! Deacon Creanga, he is the crone of all cronies. - Your Holiness... - This cannot be anymore! I saved the tower of the holy church of the crows' impoliteness, Your Holiness. I had enough of you un words! Ileana get in the house! What are you doing here? Your eyes are just like a lizard's! I don't know what I'll do to you! Get in the house! Come on! Home! - There's a hole in here. - Big hole? - Big! Big! - That's enough! Where is the boy? Outside, where else? He cannot have enough playing. You are all playing in this house! Other children his age are long in the military school! What the little school in Pacurari is not good enough for him. He'll go where I say! He's just as good for the army as I am for deaconship. We'll see. The moon and the stars are the lights of the sky... You'll finish that manual, by the time the boy will be a general! - What are you putting on? - Ilang, ilang. Let's call him to the consistory! This cannot go on! - You said we're going to the photograph. - When did I say that? Yesterday, the day before... Rather than give a penny so people can see me spread on a tin foil, better buy with that a basket full of cheese or trout. - Father pays... - I know very well how your father will pay! A mouse, when e doesn't go in hole he'll tie a pan to his tail! - What is it, you little git? - It's not good all-too-pious Creanga! You are being called to the consistory... The theatre, the crows... Are you missing reverend! - Pull! - It stinks! - What's this? - Miranda. Miranda soap! And this? Dentaline. It cleans teeth! Miranda, dentaline, ilang ilang! This doesn't smell like a house for people! - Where's the cat? - I married her. - And this?! - And this. - Why? - You're saying... It stunk. - Balanica?! - Yes! Exactly her! Mother Evghenia, you really liked my long hair... This is for you. We baptize God's servant Ion and may he be cleaned of all his sins! The devil lies in the idiot's arse! Reverends! - Children have you ever seen a kitten? - We have! Yes! - Stefan, how many legs has a kitten? - Kitten has four legs. - Bravo! How many ears has a kitten? - A kitten has two years. - How many wings has kitten? - A kitten has no wings. What does a kitten eat, Pascu? A kitten eats: sparrows, milk, bread, meat, ham... Enough, you're making us all hungry with all the good food. Children, can the cat walk from the table to back of the room? Yeees! Then remember. Hands on the chest! The ones that can walk on their own from one place to another is called a being. "The ones that can walk on their own from one place to another is called a being." Ailenei, is the book a being? - The book is not a being, master teacher. - What, what, what? - It is not a being! - But didn't it go from the front... ...to the back of the class? Who knows? Why isn't the book a being? Stan! It is not because you threw it, master teacher. That's right! You see children, the book isn't a being... If you close it it's a thing, but if you open it... It talks to you. This you will understand later! - Have you ever seen a train? - Yeeees! - What does the train do? - Uuu! - Is the train a being? - Nooo... But isn't it going on it's own from one place to another? Vlad! - No! - Why? Dimitriu! The train does not go on its own, the mechanic drives it! Well done! That's how you should all do it! First think well and only then you may talk! Well done Dimitriu! You should come to me during the brake I'll give you a lollypop. - How is your mother? - My mother does shirts for me sir. Shut up you all! I don't want to hear a fly! What's the first person in this saying? Me sir, because I spoke. - And the second? - Yourself. - Why? - Because, I spoke to you. Ad the third? Who knows? I know master teacher! Mother, because we both talked about her. Well done! You ask me something now. How is your missis? All and nothing for I cannot say my god, and the word goes up in smoke! A story! A story! May god protect you all you dear boys! What are you thinking that I am bottomless sack of stories?! Even if one takes out of a sack of flower without putting back anything, will be gone in no time... There was once, an old man and an old woman... He was writing so well... With a mind like his to end up in madhouse?! The man is like a violin. Put a finger in one place it sounds a certain way, put a finger somewhere else sounds different! Today you're in a good mood for philosophy, Mr. Rubin. "Stars in the skies over the sea" "Burning horizons right to achieve." O lord, what a miracle! Tell me who wrote this? Mr. Eminescu! Now he is out. - It's the last place I looked for you! - What is it Enachescu, what's burning? It's burning, tomorrow we have to be before the commission for manuals. And you are wandering all over! I had enough looking for you in all godforsaken places. Zahei! Look at them how they sleep! Sister, wake up sister! - Kiss your hand brother! - Forget it, Zahei. Welcome! - Where's? - She left. - Where? - To her mother, she said She said she'll never come back ever! Oi, the place of a flower is on its branch! - Where was I? - To no deed without a pay. Good" The bastard the scoundrel, he was grinning at me sometimes and kept drinking. I am not one those that he thinks I am, I never jumped over the fence ever I my life. With me you're trying to harness your bulls?! Then you should know they'll be left without horns! Well, let me show you my way! We got out like bugs in the heat of the sun... Enough we got flogged by the cold winds all the winter through the cracked walls of the school. - You were telling a story? - Yes, "The goat with the three yeanlings". You know many of these? It's a saying: everyone for himself is a bread-tailor. - How many are they? Many... - You should write them down. Who would be interested in these peasantries? Anyone, everyone. Myself! Continue! Dumitriu, go on! Well then remember, child, what I'm telling you, if at the end he had a nose left to smell his way here... - They still didn't leave. - Now they leave. Please excuse me. - Come, up! - Good day! No! Ah! What a pain... Take it and beat it against this wall and you against that wall and you stay here in the house... When are the boys coming home What mum saying" Aaa... Stay here in the house! Food? An onion, a piece of garlic, a piece of cold cornbread of the shelf. It's enough for a young wife like yourself! Milk, cheese, butter, eggs, we could pinch them... take them to the market and make a few pennies... 'Cause the house became heavier with an extreme eater! 'Cause the house became heavier with an extreme eater! Tinca, look who's here! You're difficult to find. We have guests! Welcome to my kingdom, ambassador of darkness! Tell me what have they invented this time. - Here! - Read! My dear honorable, out of the reason of the highly ordinance number 1651 I have the honor to inform you that you are no longer to continue the works for deaconship, for ever until you can prove and give signs of better behavior. Oi, when you read you don't stutter. Yes, when I read I don't stutter. So I am stopped for ever until I behave properly. Run Vasilica! What did you do here? Looks like the cats didn't spare it. Take it! - How is that! - Just like that. - Tinca lay the table! - I don't know if I can stay for dinner. Bring the bag to the table, if you brought the food from home! All right... The head bump will stay forever until it heals! We'll see... Make way!.. You filled my house with paper. None of your business! Wherever I turn is all papers and rubbish. Who ever said that the unbeaten wife is like an un locked mill. I'll shut up! Everyone to the food! Hey meow, hey meow, have the food but only mine... Mushrooms! Or if you want wood ears. At least watch them... You stamped a whole stew in there. - Hey, boy hey! - Mr. Constantin! Hey, boy hey! Come here! Hey you're grown up now! So this is the military school! Constantin have you met Mr. Hulub, our friend? The water guy, Hulub. - If you haven't met, introduce each other. - Handsome you are... Hay, are you deaf?! I'll kick your arse... He's become some big shot, the wanker! Get in the house! You too! I've had enough of you over the head! Not a sound! Oh, shut up Gerila... Oh, shut up Gerila... Does what? He's fiddling through the garbage paper... He writes down in sweats all sorts of rubbish on paper... He didn't even touched the food! How can you teach an old horse to amble? Uncle... I'm giving up writing... - You are not giving up! - I'm struggling for a week for nothing! That's good, that's good nothing comes without struggle! Try wrinting same way you tell me stories. - It's easy to tell stories... - Or your pranks in the childhood. It's hard to write them! Uncle I never met in my life someone to tell stories the way you do. Believe me you have a gift! And it's not to little. It's hard to write. Look, I'd rather sit here, then start writing! - You are writer without knowing it. - No! I'm sweating all from dawn till dusk and just as Tinca said: I'm not scribbling a half of page... The soul has to be worked out, the way you work the land, if you want to harvest. - I don't know what to say? - I don't know what to say, come on! Come Uncle! Come on it's Thursday! Then the others said: Oh, shut up Gerila, our heads are spinning! Some devilish creature you are!... - I'm taking you tomorrow to Junimea. - Me? And do what in there with these peasantries? Excuse me for a moment. Uncle, what are you doing where're you going? I cannot my dear Mihai, look at my feet... They are all nice people, my place is not there?! I've seen Mr. Melnic, I read him and he said is all right. An idiot praises another idiot! What do you think Tinca, what I do is man's writing, or is it some foolish thing the turkeys will laugh at me. Talking to you or the cats it's all the same! Few days ago I read at the Junimea and everybody said is good. But I still can't believe it, how can it be good? An idiot, a boor like me to be able to write! - How do you do it? - With smoked ham. I know you can do that. Yes, in a manner of speaking, I have a little talent myself, don't I? Who told you this foolishness? Just about everyone wasting time in here, that's all they talk about. Talent up and talent down! - Tinca! - What? - If there's no smoke there's no fire! - So, what with that! - My god how proud I am! - If only your head would clear of smoke. - Tinca, mamaliga! - Watch out Ion, mamaliga! One, two, three, four... Vasiliu, where were you yesterday? - I was sick, master' teacher. - But what's wrong with you? - I have a twinge, master teacher. - Where? Here, when it hits can't even breathe. You should come to me, I'll give you something to heal. Come here I'll kiss the place'! Hey, what's with you? What joys are you bringing today? You haven't seen me, I never saw you. What I'm telling you is a secret. All right, all right, go ahead, I'll be right with you. Copy the exercise at page 30. You watch them! Hey, what are you doing gathering the crows around you? I have nothing to do with you... The ones out of deaconship must leave the school as well. - Is this what the moralistic laws are saying! - Do you know something! - The government has fallen. - The joy of all the fools! They send telegram from Bucharest. They sacked you for incompatible facts, incorrigible... Mr. Minster Tell. Are you all right? I... I'm so sorry! - Matches. - Here! - Are they damp? - No. - Lacme tobacco... - All out! - What do you have? - Husi tobacco. - It's musty. - Here's another one. - Broken corner. - Here's a sealed one. Ion... - What is it Ileana? - Is it hard? Pray Ion... Pray! Let's just pray the way we only know. Honorable Minster, having seen the communicate in the 155 monitor I was painfully surprised to find myself blamed by you too without being listened to and also expelled from the teaching corps... Without being judged as would the law of Public Instruction, demand... - Go away from there you little devils! - We're out! - I was saying... - We're out! - Matches! - Out! - Kissing hand boyar! - What's your name young fellow? - Nita Pribescu. - And where are you going? Take out a Lillie. There it is! I'll plant it back at the gate. - But, why didn't your father do it? - He's been ill for a long time. - And your mother? - Dead. - And you are the head of the family? - That's what they say. Come over here. Get in the slade. Why aren't you in school, Nita? We only go on Wednesdays and Fridays there are not enough rooms. - We also take turns for the shoes. - Which is the school? - That one! - I see it's big enough. It's big, but the mayor also stays in it. Boyar, if it catches and blooms, in may I'll bring a whole bunch. Come, come in! Hurry up! Hurry up or the child will catch a cold! - Excuse us, we are looking for the school. - This is it! Are you the inspector? Be quiet my dear, be quiet! Are you the inspector. - We are just looking for the school. - I was very busy... This is the school! - Who are you? - The mayor's wife. - And the teacher? - Also myself, I mean... I'm replacing him. I knew you were coming... My husband, has everything arranged at father Stere. This is Mr. Creanga, schoolmaster at the new college. I believe you heard of his manuals. - Where are the students? - Well, it's too cold! One more question: Did you move into the school or the school moved in? - Well, what's new? - I just come back from the cable. Your lordship's government is about to fall and we still have allot of things to settle. What have you got against Eminescu, Mr. Petrino? Nothing, what's to have? I just don't like his kind... The ones that never return the books to the library. So what's my fault? I got married when I was 14? I was a child and he was 30 years older than I was. I had enough of all this. I had enough! Poor mother, it was her dream. Yes, do you, understand a dream... To have her daughter married with a university professor. She was laundering dirty linen in their houses... - They are all gone! - They are not all gone! I have two grown up daughters! Don't you find it sensible that after I sacrificed my childhood for this marriage... You are terrible! You either separate... Or... I cannot take it anymore! As much as I wanted from life and as little I wish for now! You don't understand, you are mine only... And I am here, next to you! Yes, you are very close close, but unreachable! Come on, Tinca! Come put something on the table. Come, wake up! Meat rolls with buckwheat. As poor as I was yesterday and the day before and all my life, I have never ever been! - Tinca! - What? Bring the meat rolls! There is some light outside! "It seemed between the clouds a gate had nearly opened "... - It was! - It was, it was. My God how could you write such wanders! "and when I think of life it seems it slowly runs" "Being retold with someone else's mouth..." - What are they, meat rolls! - Have them! God forbids! - Tinca, the meat rolls! - Come on uncle tell me what's bothering you! Bothering me, bothering me! Here! I'll throw them to the cat you'll see! Here is the wire. They've sacked you! Yes! What shall I do? Dismissal?! The greatest poet of Romania?! To have Eminescu dismissed? And whom? Mr. minister Chitu! I am the minister, on Ticau and the Weeping Valley! Hold him, hold him uncle! Of all my sins. - Are you all right? - I'm all right. My poor bones they are all worn out. - I'll go get the rest of the books. - Go Mihai. Go so you can come back from somewhere. In the Creanga kingdom of the enlightened land of the eternal Ticau. - Tinca, the cats ate? - They have! - Then what the hell is wrong with them? - How should I know? In a few minutes there'll be a total eclipse sir. Here's the Radauti barrel... Barrels with gherkins!... Windows, windows! Old clothes, old clothes... I'd like to sell some books, Mr. Rubin. What a shame! Everybody sells books today, in this godforsaken town! Nobody buys them anymore. Such a shame! Extraordinary! Good God! Valeria! Mother! Valeria! Virginica! God forbids! In a house with 11 cats! It's passed midnight and he is still awake. Go on, jump in the bed! - Leave me, leave me! - Cut it out! - Ion leave the wall alone, Ion! - What's wrong? - The Universal Ondulation Theory... - Is that what you read last night? Any live organic being is a cluster of molecules, which forces converge... - You didn't understand! - I'm a little strong headed. Then take the "Conversations" and do one more reading. Tonight there is Conta visiting. Heavy night I had! At least we managed to wake up at noon the big boyars. - Like aristocrats! - You are one of them and you don't know? - Oh, my God, who said that? - Schopenhauer. Is this a friend of yours, for I might believe him! There are three kinds of aristocracy: of birth and rank, two: of money, not our case, and three of the spirit... What do you say about the last? My stupid mind says of the top of my head: the word spirit doesn't pair up with the word aristocrat. - Why? - It doesn't sound Romanian. - Maybe in German... - And also this friend of mine says that everyone of these aristocracies is surrounded by an army of coveters. You are starting to make sense. Coveter yes! It goes with aristocrat, but the word spirit still don't sound well. Wait Tinca will clear this for us. - Tinca! Tinca! - What do you want? Tinca, here before you there are two aristocrats. They got out of bed at noon, and are now going for a walk and they'll come back as hungry as a pack of wolves. So you better harness the horses to the carriage. Yes, yes, here I go take the cats have them shoed up. Oh God, this is beautiful! Where shall we go today? I say to Ciric over the hills. On a weather like this we better take the side roads. - Same way! - Same! - People will get suspicious. - Let them. All right but just today. Tomorrow you better walk on your own on Mrs. Micle's Street. - Ion - What Tinca? - Balanica gave birth! - How many? - Many, four! - Drown them! What are you saying! Is that a woman's job? You know I can't do it Tinca... Listen, let them live! If there's enough food for 11 there'll be enough for 15. Ion, Ion, off course that's what you've waited for! That's my only fortune, this herd of cats. That must be the culprit, Titu, they all look like him. Titu! Bravo Titu love them all, maybe love is good for something. Yes, yes, bravo Titu, bravo! As much as the devil's illness! To the drunkard even the devil brings a full cup! Here's broken 'course I fixed it! The man sanctifies the place! It's not a joke! Uncle! - Write a story. - You think that's what I need now? Uncle Nichifor... It's not a story one imagined. He is a man like all men that once lived... Ion, Ion wake up! Ion wake up! Ion you're talking in your sleep, wake up Ion! - Come on, wake up! - What? Wait! Tinca, you don't know It's in Cimpoiesti at Uncle Dediu's wedding ...A father-in-law King Tub was given by uncle Dediu 49 sheep all brown of one eye. Sisters the protopope said, why don't you behave in the monastery... Well then, honorable father they said with all the respect, this wool is itchy.. What can I tell you now?! Grown up men fooling around at midnight! Ion, I'm going to bed. Come on, tell me some more. And at once uncle Nichifor grabs the mares by the rein, and turns the wagon around, and takes it back to the glade. Here it is missus what a piece of God's heaven is in here! You'd want to live and never die. Hear the nightingales laughing at us. May you be struck by luck, you nightingales, but I do know you are in love! Missus, you know what I thought of by the fire? - What Nichifor? - After you fall asleep, Get one of the mares and go home get a good piece of axe... - And by the daylight I'll be right back. - Oh, my God, Nichifor... I don't want to sleep anymore I'll come and sit next to you all night. - But what's the truth with Manca? - That wolf over there missus. Things were looking pretty bad and she stayed very close to him. You better get a hold of yourself missus, stay calm where in there! I don't want to uncle Nichifor. She came in the grass next to him. One said one thing, the other another thing, after a while they both fell asleep. - Uncle, a story uncle. - A story - Go away devils, go away I need a bath. - But after your bath you tell us a story? Go away! You, cursed things! Hey devils, I'll brake your legs if I ever catch you again around here! Go home! You know, the butcher said yesterday he's cutting the credit. - Who, uncle Serafim? - Yes. So what shall I do! Ever since there are three mouths to feed the expenses are higher Ion. Tinca! Don't you say one thing about Mihai not one more word against him! You are treating me as if I'm... Of course, you paid for that picture. You were not cheap with money and whatever else! I am sorry! My terrible nature. That's how I am when I get mad! I'll take your picture too... Naked. Leave me alone! Who is it? Again? Well, I can't find Mr. Eminescu?! It's three days since I've been looking for him at the paper... Yesterday, today... It was you that said he's working in there? There, there. Give me that. He didn't turn up home either for three. - When does he have to be in court? - Tomorrow morning eight o'clock. - Bring my clothes Tinca. - Well, well, well... But the doctor said you shouldn't get out of the house for a week. Gentlemen it's all clear: it will be war! Here's the Courier! Fiery talks in the Romanian Parliament! Worried we were, God's servants Tinca and Ion and every night we waited for you with hot food on the table! Some from here, some the illness! What perfume?! Look at that! To Mr. Mihai Eminescu, poet. - Read. - I... my God, Ion. Let's see: "Reading your poem, my mother did not let me write to bachelors but I..." I'm having an urge to push it! "...my mother says I'm a stupid girl and I know nothing..." - What does it say in here, uncle? - But when I'll start to learn...! Ion cut it out! Laugh, uncle, laugh! An educated man putting up with the bushy-man over there. Tinca, open the window let the smoke out of the scent, I still believe in heaven without richness. - Aferim Mihai, let's see if you still have some. - There's that subpoena. What's your name? Mihai Eminescu. - How old are you? - 26. Have you ever been in court before, and for what? Never been in court. When did you start working as a librarian, at the Iasi Library? September 1, 1874. The present librarian, Mr. Dimitrie Petrino, to which you handed the library over, complained referring to the missing of several books out of the state's library. What do you have to say? Mr. Eminescu, can you hear me? What is it? Did you tell them? Have you defended yourself? Defend myself? A man like you harassed by a lowlife like Petrino! Why don't you complain against him? A piece of cloth for wounds. Two shirts, thick socks... You're lucky you don't have a boy the right age to go on the front. - But you don't either. - As a volunteer I'm afraid they'll keep him. - What's your name? - Elena Zafiridi. - Are they real? - Of course they are! - Well but there is a fortune in here madam. - Yes! And? I say, let's take them to the city hall and have them registered. We can't. - Write the moment you arrive, my boy. - Make sure you remember to send me money. - I'll send you no mater what. - I know you have. Zahei's tobacconist the salary, and the manuals... - Well... Look who's keeping my tab. - No, forget it, forget it... Come on, have a good trip and take care! I'm a little chilly. Must be the nervousness. - Go on Tinca, bring my coat. - What coat? - What do you mean, what coat I only have one. - My God Ion but your coat is in Plevna. You gave it away to the ladies society from Iasi - And left me naked! - Yes. Go Tinca for you'll get a right beating just by the book... - I brought them. - Then let's begin. - Only if you have all your brain at home. - There is and there isn't Enachescu. My boy volunteered and that's not easy. - Then let's leave it. - No, let's not leave it. Each with his war. - There are no mistakes. - Read, Read. From flax as well as hemp they make linen. From flax as well as hemp... From flax and hemp. - Which one is the best? - To hell with it! From flax as well as from hemp, or from... Don't you make faces Enachescu. The tong of one nation must be in the school book as clear as a mountain stream. A mountain stream? As clear as... Clear as the mountain stream... I cannot take this. Good bye! From flax and hemp... From flax and from hemp... I'm hungry Tinca and Mihai is late. He's probably over the Iloaia Bridge. Well, how can he be all the way there? Your son man, on the way to the front. I found the pig but, where's the sow? Yes Miss? Please there is an article about the theatre. - Yes, and? - Could you tell me who wrote it? - Wasn't it signed? - Mr. Goldstein? Over there, over there... A fat and ugly guy wrote it! Yes, but he said good things about me! - Are the actress Despineanu? - How do you know? - The lottery advert please. - Over there, sir, over there. - Did you write it by any chance? - No Miss. I tried once writing theatre articles but I got a whole bunch of letters, saying they're going to burn my house down. - The man who wrote this, maybe he is coming? - Maybe. - Hello, Mr. Director. - Good day. Mr. Eminescu, I have some business for you. The mayor, Mr. Pastia, was attacked in the Romanian Star, and I'd very much like you to, as a man of words, to write a few words in his defense. But I don't even know Mr. Pastia. I have no opinion, good, nor bad about this gentleman. Hear is my proposition. I write the article myself, but you'll have to sign it. I cannot accept my stile be by mistake associated with someone's - Who barely has any idea about writing. No! - Mr. Eminescu! I don't want anymore to be associated with anybody! And especially I don't want to assume a third hand lawyer's spelling mistakes! At the end of the day, don't forget, lam the director of the print shop and I'm not asking this for a free. Here is your salary, for half of month. - You have no shame! - This man is crazy! I shall give him the sack! You're making, out of quiet and honest men, people that don't understand what's going on around them. But who will understand yourself?! I'm sorry but the newspaper, is almost out. Mihai I'm sorry to tell you this but you're not doing the right thing. - Why? - What was wrong with that article? You know me for along time. I don't praise nor do I swear without a good reason. - Praise him over the top maybe he'll be ashamed. - The kiss-ass politics, let it to the kiss-ass. - What is it? - You have a subpoena. Tomorrow at 9. Your house is burning, Mr.! Who is it? Who is it? May god give you days to live, Ion my dear. May He give you a all his rich gifts, if you will behave like you are for some time now. If my mother would have beat me up with all of her thoughts And if she would have kicked me out of the house like a stranger, I still wouldn't have been as humiliated before her as I was when she spoke to me gently. Oh Lord, I'm sorry I'm ungrateful, but take e away from these documents! Doctor Mihailis Eminescu, graduate in many un-useful sciences Ex librarian when he robed his own library, ex school inspector at the girls' school, ex editor in chief of the stray cows notice. Ex! Ex! "If you speak, I pretend I don't hear, Don't say "no" and never praise you" "Dance the only way you want, Never booing, not applauds." What happened? Come... Come. Uncle Mihai! Uncle! It's a week since you've last been to the cabin. I heard you're leaving the newspaper, is it true? - It is. - We'll find something else. - I'm leaving Iasi as well. - Iasi?! I couldn't, Mr. poet... You see man is like a violin... Press a finger in one place, sounds one way. Press a finger in a different place sounds all different. Come on! It's true! - You gave him your jacket... - Don't mind me... - What have you solved with this? - Nothing... Come for nothing, go for nothing! All aboard! All aboard! Mihai, without you my sense in life disappears. Uncle this is just sweet talk, they cannot fit two men! What's with the silence? Tinca? What do you want? What do I want, hat do I want... I told you so the illness is coming back... It'll come back anyway 'cause there's a cure for it. - Tinca - What? - Bring Balanica. - What do you want with it? - I want to see her. - Here she is. That's Balanica? Well, Balanica, her daughter, the mother died long time ago. Died! How? You think anybody saw her the cat died of old age. - These are consuming and that's all! - She died! I know, your wife ran after her and you found her in the neighborhood. - Well they're both up in smoke now. - Tinca, don't be blasphemous! Our turn will come! What are you going to do Tinca when I'm gone? I'll get married. All my life I wanted a white wedding dress. So that word in the story it's all true... Which one of them Ion? That from now it's not too far to far away! Ion, Ion, I've made some beans and some smoked sausages, Ion, you want some? Ever since Mihai left nothing is too good for you. Don't forget about the trip tomorrow. Wide over wide and over wide she's all red cheeks. Over red cheeks, bandy Over bandy all clear Over all clear, yellowish and on top is bottom. - Guess what! - Ion, I told you your illness will turn you back. You know I have the barrel ready, if you feel it's coming... Oh my, I almost forgot... The students in Neamt, they want to visit at two, at 4 the girls from the Normal school. Ion, even at the St. Paraschieva's relics is less pilgrimage. Shut up you broken mill and bring the beans! The good thought enlightened you Ion. I was quite suspicious. Wrong way. Turn back. Get of gentlemen, please. - What's wrong with the uncle? Why is he upset? - I'll make him talk. Mr. Creanga, why don't you try my recipe and you'll be fat like a pig in no time? Doctor... In the mornings a steam of chicken soup with noodles wakes me up and meat rolls of smoked ham and. And I fill myself with two plates - of soup and a whole pan of meat rolls. - So I believe. After which I'm going for a walk and by Tiru's tavern there's nothing wrong with a whole grilled chicken, with garlic sauce, quail pastrami on a weak fire and a cornflower pie The one that gets spread from the hand to the mouth and from the mouth to the hand. A jug of wine, only just to settle by Bolta Rece where the Moldavian pies are waiting hot on the stove. Shut up! When I get back home and the table is all set the ever unsatisfied gut of a human being is asking for his right. Again? And after a good sleep, I'm going out and use your recipe as well. This one speaks a word with you and you're sore for a week afterwards. - Why Mr. Creanga? - What is it madam? Why did you leave? Where did you put it? Didn't you write in "Conversations": "I've seen this world without you is not empty." This is childish. I'll look it up, you know. - It's far away now... - What's wrong uncle, are you sick? No... I was thinking who I was, and where I am now! I left my village, in their world there is no place for me. I am left all alone with my stories... And they are saying in town they are not mine. Water, fire and the people's mouths, you cannot stop them! That's right madam, Everyone with it's own! Uncle, uncle... Were ready to go. Please to the carriages. Gentlemen! - Kissing hand boyar! - How are you, Nita Brehuescu? Well boyar you never came back. The lilac bloomed long time ago. - Where is the other boyar? - Far away Nita, all the way to Bucharest. - How is your father? - He's gone the poor soul'. - And these are your brothers? - Now I am really the head of the family! Wait a minute. - Here Nita. Take this! - What are you doing Mr. Creanga? - Kiss your hand boyar. - You should learn, you all, should go to school! Come... And what have you solved with that Mr. Creanga? Nothing. Nothing... - What is it uncle? Are you all right! - Yes, but I feel it coming! Filipas, turn around and take Mr. Creanga. Mrs. Veronica please come here Mrs. Veronica, please, there is space... Uncle Mihai, What's with the Bucharest so you forgot for good our pitiful Iasi? I've been waiting for you. Tinca prepared everything. In Iasi snows beautifully since last night there's enough for slades. Come brother Mihai, for without you I'm a stranger. Tinca, have you locked the gate? Yes! It's closed, it's open, who will cross our threshold? - Happy new year master teacher. - To your health! - Gold help you all! - And you, and you. - To your good health master teacher. - To yours children. Happy new year! May the lord give you all you wish for. - May you live long Mr. Creanga. - New Year! - Happy new year, Mr. Teacher. - New Year! New Year! The stupid man don't see the foot threshold until he hits the top one with the head! Where do you see a threshold Ion?! What are you doing here Uncle Nichifor? I came to take you! - Where to Uncle Nichifore? - To Humulesti, child. Come on! Master Teacher! Master Teacher! Well, I've been in this world a lump with two eyes, a piece of live clay in Humulesti... Not beautiful until 20, not quiet until 30 not even rich until 40. But as poor as this year, as last year and as ever in my life, I've never been before!
