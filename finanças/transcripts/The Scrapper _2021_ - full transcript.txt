MAN: In prison I saw my life clear for the first time. I remembered my old man and the things he told me about our family. [CRASHING] About the bond between Punjabis and Mexicans. How it all started over a hundred years ago during segregation, because we were all considered brown. [WHIRRING] Nobody talks about it anymore. But those ties are still strong. Thousands of Punjabis cross the U.S. Mexico border every year. And it's all controlled by the cartels. In exchange, the Punjabi bosses let them use their trucks to smuggle drugs all across the country. It can go down many ways. But the only thing that matters, is that the illegals and the drugs end up in the same place. Then the cartel gets its drugs. And the illegals... they're set free. As free as you can be anyway. [RATTLING] [CLICKING] [SPEAKING PUNJABI] He run. We catch. [GUNSHOTS] [SPEAKING PUNJABI] MAN: This generation. They want everything easy. It's a shame. [CLICKING] [BANGING] [TRAIN RATTLING] [CAR HONKING] Goddamn it. Room's clean? Locksmith wants 20 bucks to open it. [DRILLING] [BANGING] [GRINDING] [HINGE CREAKING] MAN: Worked my whole goddamn life. And I got nothing to show for it. Don't worry about it. I'll take the safe. Gonna sell the metal anyway. [ENGINE TURNING OVER] [ENGINE STARTS] MAN: My man, Jake. I heard that van before I saw it. Smelled it before I heard it. [CHUCKLING] What you got? Shit load. Not even a ton. Oh. I'll get it unloaded for you. Migs. Hey, you know your sister's around back. She's gonna want to see you. - Yeah. - [MAN LAUGHING] [GRINDING] WOMAN: Only way in is the undercarriage. If you don't know it's there, you never see it. My eyes are playing tricks on me. Hey, sis. We're done here, yes? Old habits die hard. JAKE: Just doing someone a favor, sis. WOMAN: You doing okay? How's JB? We're good. You've been out six months. How long are you gonna keep this up? Come back and work with me. It's not me. Not anymore. [TRAIN RATTLING] Hi! Something smells good. - Mmm-hmm. - What's the occasion? Dinner. But first. Maybe clean yourself up. Okay, JB? JB? Bud? [KNOCKING] JB? Okay. Come and get it. Where's JB? He's in his room. [DOOR SLAMMING] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [JEERING] MAN: Hey, listen... [INDISTINCT CHATTER] MAN: Whoa! Playing with knives is dangerous, little fool. [STUTTERING] It's a whittling tool, dummy. [STUTTERING] [BOTH LAUGHING] Retard. [LAUGHING] Wait! Wait, you assholes. Please. Please, man. Jake. Stop it. You, you might hurt him. Hey, I'm sorry man. We were just, we were just messing around. Get out of here. You okay, buddy? Yeah. I'm okay. My brother came. I just wanted to sit by the water. Come on. Finished. [CHUCKLING] Damn. Bad word. Sorry, big guy. JB: I know a secret. No secrets, remember? No secrets. I don't know. I just... thought... maybe... you won't love me when the baby comes. JAKE: Hey. Brothers love each other. No matter what. Good night. JB: [WHISPERING] Night, night. Good night. Mmm. I can't keep watch 24/7. I told you. Think I'll make a good dad? - Hmm. [LAUGHS] - Hey. I'm working two jobs and barely getting by. How am I going to watch a kid? I mean, you're barely working. I want us to move Upstate. Upstate? - JAKE: Yeah. - Okay, what are we supposed to do Upstate? Start a construction company. I had time to think. While you were in jail? That's why I need to get away. Because the longer I'm here... It's like a shadow, just... Just hanging over me. I can't raise a kid like that. I don't want to be, to him, what my father was to me. You never talk about your father. I don't know what he means to you. I never met your sister. You never talk about your life. You're my life. You, JB, and now the baby. [JB STRAINING] [JAKE LAUGHING] [CHEERING] Yes! Whoo! You got fat. [LAUGHING] That all you got? JB: Huh? Hey. Wait. No. No. - JB: Huh? - Okay. Okay. - [JB LAUGHS] - You win. You win. Let's go home. - JB: Mmm. - [JAKE LAUGHS] Are you working again today? Yeah, I am. That's great, Jake. Where? The yard. [MOUTHING] [THUNDER RUMBLING] MAN ON PHONE: We got your number. Leave a message. [CAR HONKING] [SPEAKING SPANISH] [DOG BARKS IN THE DISTANCE] [SPEAKING SPANISH] Argh. [DOGS BARKING] [TENSE MUSIC CONTINUES] [SPEAKING SPANISH] I'm only telling you this one more time. I want to talk to Oscar. And I'm telling you for the last time. Oscar isn't running things anymore. [GRUNTS] They've sent me here, to this shit hole city, to chase up every bad debt he ever let get out of hand. And I can't leave until that's what I've done. So, for the sake of both of us... [INHALES] Let's work together. [DOOR SLAMMING] WOMAN: Jake! Oh, yeah. [LAUGHS] Looks like he'd need protection. Who are you supposed to be? [JAKE GROANS] Well, Jake, my name is Frankie. [EXHALES] I'm the guy you should thank that you're still alive. I cleaned your goddamn money like I was asked. You took advantage of an old dying man. And that betrayal of trust. Well, that's... that's a violation. [TENSE MUSIC CONTINUES] I want the debt, paid in full, with interest. Or I'm going to burn this whole fucking place down. I don't have that kind of cash. You have a week. [CLICK] [BULLET DROPS] [SNORTS] FRANKIE: You look good on your knees. [BREATHING HEAVILY] [JAKE GRUNTS] [COUGHING] [BREATHING HEAVILY] What did you do? I asked Oscar to keep you safe in jail. The deal was I'd pay it off by cleaning money for them. But? WOMAN: But I skimmed a little off the top. Come on, Jake. Just like Dad. Dad is dead. Dad is dead! Oscar knew about it. He didn't care. He's our blood. How much do you owe? 100 grand, give or take. What were you thinking? I was thinking they were gonna cut you to pieces in there. Then, money was thin. This place was going under Uh. [EXHALES] [MOUTHING] I saw a chance to get back on our feet. And I took it. [EXHALES] Where we gonna get 100 grand? I don't know, baby brother. Finally. I'm starving! Mmm. [SIGHS DEEPLY] What happened? It's an accident at work. Are you in trouble? Please, tell me. That's our savings, Jake. We worked a long time for that. I know, Kitt. But... Emily... I thought we were your family now. [DOOR SLAMS] You shouldn't fight. It's not good for the baby. I know, buddy. I know. Why don't you go watch some TV? Before bed? Yeah, sure. Okay. [MAN SPEAKING PUNJABI] You Punjabis fascinate me. You bring our drugs across the border, but you don't sell 'em. You offer your own people new life in this country, only to enslave and abuse 'em. [SPEAKS HINDI] [SCOFFS] Tell me, Officer, where do you draw the line? The correct way to say it is Punjabi. [THUDS] [SPEAKS PUNJABI] Oscar. You allow us to bring our people across the border. We facilitate the trucks that run your drugs in. And now, we clean your money. It is, uh, a simple arrangement. We stay out of your business, beyond that. And we'd appreciate the same from you. Oh, you're doing a good job. I'll give you that. Unlike some of the associates of my uncle. [SPEAKS PUNJABI] Mmm... [SPEAKS SPANISH] I was just explaining here, to my nephew, the unique way you have moved money. I, uh, I understand that you auction off our money amongst your people. Yes. Our committee system is a centuries-old tradition based on trust. Oh, it's good. And completely off the grid. And, we're all about trust. [BIDS CONTINUE IN PUNJABI] So, stock the ammunition. [ALL CLAPPING] One million USD. We'll need more time than usual. [GRUNTS] You have a month. Well, then, to long life. [GLASSES CLINKING] God willing. [ALL CHUCKLING] Might as well open a bloody Western Union. Your anger is a weakness. It gives you away. [CLEARS THROAT] [SPEAKS HINDI] Ji, saab. [CELL PHONE VIBRATING] You remember Veer? He's got a proposition. I thought, what's the harm in putting it to you. What's in it? Money. Lots of money. Lots? Like, 100 grand? I didn't set this up, Jake, I swear. Maybe it's a godsend. Whose is it? - Whose money is it? - LINDA: Jake, this could clear the debt. That's all it is. There's nothing we can't have. He's already guaranteed, he can get you in easy, do the job quick, get out. And there are no guards. No cameras. Alarm is easy. But you'd be taking the risk. JD: Hey. Hey. Ready to do work out? Not today, okay? Yeah. I know that look. I don't like it. [MELANCHOLIC MUSIC CONTINUES] LEON: Good you're getting out of this shit world. Still in it. [CHUCKLES] Doesn't look like it, brother. May be a big rusty. Ditch it. We get caught, that's a weapon. It means armed robbery, not burglary. [CHANTS PRAYER IN PUNJABI] [SIREN WAILING] [SPEAKS PUNJABI] Protect and feed those in need. It's every Sikh's duty. Is that what you plan on doing with the money? My wife is dying, Mr. Jake. In Punjab. We have a son. My plan was to bring them here. Life did not agree. These men have my passport. They bring our people here with the promise, they're going to give them paper and employment. But you're forced to do illegal things. And if you refuse, they threaten our family back home. That's the only chance, that I see my wife alive. [THUDDING] [DOOR SLAMS SHUT] [ALARM KEYPAD BEEPING] [DOOR OPENS] - Alarm is off. - [GRUNTS] VEER: Why? Can't look like an inside job. [BOTH GRUNTING] [DRILLING] Get the bag. My passport, please. [TENSE MUSIC CONTINUES] [RESOUNDING GUNSHOT] [VEER EXCLAIMING IN PAIN] [GUN COCKING] [VEER WRITHES IN PAIN] [VEER COUGHING] [TENSE MUSIC CONTINUES] [BOTH GRUNTING] You know what happens to cop killers? [BREATHING HEAVILY] - [GUN COCKING] - [BULLET CLATTERING] [OBJECT CLATTERING] [GROANS] [VEER COUGHING] [BREATHING HEAVILY] Get it? Life did not agree. [BREATH TREMBLING] Please. [VEER GRUNTS] [RECEDING FOOTSTEPS] [BREATHING HEAVILY] LINDA: This is beyond me. And the cop? The younger brother. [SNIFFLES] Tell me he's dead. He's alive. Didn't see my face. And the only guy that can tie us to this, he's dead. We pay off the debt, burn those passports, and split the rest. You wanted a new life, right? Leave it. Leave it! [BREATH TREMBLING] [GLASS THUDS] How did the underworld get away? Perhaps you were distracted. This is unlike your brother. I will find him and kill him. We need to talk to the Mexicans. [CHUCKLING MIRTHLESSLY] And tell them what exactly, huh? I'll tell them, We need more time to work that much money, that's all, Raj. He might be working with them. A double-cross. Did you even think of that? Then... why'd he leave you alive? More importantly, why take the passports? [WAVES RIPPLING] [SPEAKS SPANISH] You doing okay, kid? - [INDISTINCT SHOUTING] - [GLASS BREAKING] I talk to your sister every once in a while. FRANKIE: Look who it is. Right on time. A drink? JAKE: The debt's paid. You leave my sister and the yard alone. We don't need your business anymore. You got a lot of sauce. I like that. You know, maybe you should, uh, you should come work for us. Like father, like son. I got other plans. [CHAIR CLATTERS] What makes you think you got a choice, cholo? [CANE THUMPS] Don't worry about him. He does not understand the history we share. Give my regards to your sister. Guess I'll be seeing your Dad soon. He was a good man. [SPEAKS SPANISH] See you soon. [CAR HONKS] JB's in the car. Wanna say bye? I wasn't there for him when he needed me. Hey. Just saying, you know. Godspeed, brother. Hey, you take care of her, all right? She takes care of me. Jake? Take the goddamn truck. KITT: [CHUCKLING] Jake. Water. JD: Guys, this is... Be careful, bud. Wow! Is this our new home? This is it, bud. There's a workshop out back plenty of space to work out, and room for the baby, when he's old enough. [KITT SIGHS] I was ten when I got that. My father took me to a fair at the temple sat me down and told me to be brave. Tell me about him. He started the scrapyard. Fixin' up trucks. He worked like a horse. And then he met a woman who agreed to marry him for papers. [Kitt] Your mother? She was Mexican. They decided to stay together and raise a family. Soon had three kids. Expenses grew and he started providing a new service, helping illegals send money back home to their families. You mean money laundering? Sure. If that's what you want to call it. What's wrong is wrong, Jake. [JAKE SIGHING] "Close to the world, but not of the world." That's what he used to say to me. Maybe you're right. It wasn't long before he got roped in with some real bad people. One night he just... never came home. You mean... Do you know who did it? No. After a while, it didn't matter. [DISTANT HOWLING] Saabji. [SPEAKS PUNJABI] Please. [SOBBING] [GUNSHOTS] Go deal with this. [INDISTINCT CONVERSATION] CASHIER: Like, it's gonna be $3.60. Hey, you, uh... You got a phone I could use? Yeah, it's... It's in the back. - Thanks. - Yeah. MAN ON PHONE: We got the number. Leave a message. You don't wanna know where I am, so, I'll just say this. I'm good. We're good. I was thinking maybe you want to come up here, spend some time with JB, get to know Kitt... It's just a thought. Anyway, I'll call again in a couple of weeks. See ya, sis. JAKE: Not too much though. JD: [GRUNTS] I'm okay. I know you are. Whoa there, big guy! - Whoa! - Huh? I got this. Mmm-hmm. There you go. JB's Work Shed. My... first... project for my nephew. [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] This is my home. I'm afraid this just couldn't wait. [CLICKS TONGUE] Stay with me, you pretty little thing. [SPEAKS PUNJABI] [KNIFE CLATTERS] FRANKIE: You wanna tell me why some two-bit, scrap collecting piece of shit paid me $100,000 of my own money? The money that you were supposed to clean? It seems we have a common problem. FRANKIE: Hmm. So let's fix it then. Who paid you this money? [PHONE RINGING] LINDA: Hello? OSCAR: Yeah, yeah, it's me. Not much time, child. The money you paid us. Where did that come from? [OSCAR SIGHING] Linda, you need to leave. Now! Oscar, we... We didn't... Now, child! That's it. Everyone... gone. [grunts] Thank you, Leon. You can go. Okay. You need to go. This is my place. [SIGHS] Yeah, well. It won't be a place without you to run it. Okay. Let's get out of here. No, Miss Linda. Let me do my part. Ah. [DOGS BARKING] - [GUN COCKING] - [DOGS WHINING] [CELL PHONE RINGING] FRANKIE: We got him. JAKE: You don't wanna know where I am, so I'll just say this. I'm good. We're good. I was thinking maybe you want to come up here, spend some time with JB, get to know Kitt... It's just a thought. Anyway, I'll call again in a couple of weeks. See ya, sis. FRANKIE: Play it again. [LEON GROANS] JAKE: You don't wanna know where I am, so I'll just say this. I'm good. We're good. I was thinking maybe you want to come up here, spend some time with JB, - get to know Kitt... - Yeah, we got a number. Find him. I can trace the number. FRANKIE: I'm gonna enjoy this. [GUNSHOT] JAKE: Push! Push! - I'm gonna head into town. - KITT: Mm. - You'll manage here? - Yeah. - Jake? - Yeah? You're gonna be a good dad. Thanks. [CAR DOOR SLAMS] [KNOCKING AT DOOR] We need to speak with Jake. What's this about? Sorry, where's his badge? This concerns Jake's wellbeing, ma'am. You'd be helping him by cooperating. I think you'd better come back when he's here. - [THUDS] - [RAJ GRUNTING] I know... - [RAJ GRUNTING] - [KITT GASPING] [GASPING] [BOTH GRUNTING] KITT: JB! JB! J... - Where's our money? - [SOBBING] JB! - Where's our money? - What? What are you doing there? Search the house! Where's our money? [BOTH GRUNTING] - [NAIL GUN CLICKING] - [RAJ SCREAMING] Kitt! Run! JB: No! [JB GRUNTING] Run! Go! [BOTH GRUNTING] [MAN SCREAMING] [GRUNTS] [JB SOBBING] He made me do a bad thing. And I'm sorry. RAJ: It's okay. Police. Just, just... Just put the gun down. [STAMMERS] Jake! - Jake! - I'll find Jake. [WHIMPERS] Jake. It's okay. Yeah. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. Jake will be here. [SHUSHES] It's okay. - [JB WHIMPERING] - It's okay. [GUN COCKING] - [GUNSHOT] - [JB GASPS] [JB WHIMPERING] [THUDS] [FIRES] [CHILDREN CHATTERING] [JAKE GRUNTING] [CLEANER 1 SCREAMING] CLEANER 2: Holy fuck! [AXE THUDS] [CLEANER 2 SCREAMING] JAKE: Where are they? I was just cleaning up the messes. Please. [GASPS] [JAKE GRUNTS] [SNIFFLES] KITT: Jake? [GASPS SOFTLY] FEMALE DOCTOR: Sir? Sir. [DISTORTED] She's in neurogenic shock. What exactly happened? She's pregnant. DOCTOR: I need hemo monitors, stat, BP every five minutes. [MACHINE BEEPING] [DOCTOR CLEARS THROAT] She's stable but we need to monitor her for a few days. The baby? The baby seems fine, thank God. About the police... I spoke to them, Doctor. I'm going straight to the precinct after this. Thank you. [FLY BUZZING] [CHAINSAW BUZZING] [BREATHING HEAVILY] [SIGHS] [FIRE CRACKLING] [CELL PHONE RINGING] [MAN SPEAKING HINDI] MAN: Hello? Jake? You're the cop? I'm his brother. Should have killed him when I had the chance. Mmm. Your family might feel the same. But you didn't. I won't make the same mistake again. Mmm. Really? It seems you still have a lot left to lose. The girl, your sister. I suggest you make your way back home with our money and everything else you took. We can find you anywhere. Hold on to the phone. We'll let you know where. I don't want anything to do with you. I don't want you anywhere near this baby. [MACHINE BEEPING] We're done. ...does. I'm sorry, Jake. LINDA: What do we do? [SHIP HONKING] JAKE: Two birds, one stone. [SONG PLAYING] [GRUNTS] [SPEAKS SPANISH] [CHOKING] You people never learn. [SPEAKING HINDI] Hmm. I pulled your fire. You're a disgrace. No, we work with the Mexicans too. But we don't go to bed with them. This is what you get when you mix blood. People like you and your brother. Don't worry. You'll be reunited soon. - [GUNSHOT FIRES] - [GRUNTS] [CONTINUES TO GRUNT IN PAIN] We've worked too hard for too long to get to where we are. [SPEAKS HINDI] That was for my leg. This is for my face. [GRUNTING] I'll finish what I started. - [COUGHS] - That girl of yours. [DISTANT GUNSHOTS] Listen to me. [DISTANT GUNSHOT] [GRUNTS] [SCREAMING] [COUGHING AND GRUNTING] [SCREAMING] [THUMPING] [COUGHS] My God. Oh, shit. Two birds... Remember? [GRUNTING] Bitch! Fuck you! Get the cop's gun. [INDISTINCT SHOUTING] They'll come for you. [SCOFFS] No. They won't. [GUNSHOT] [BODY THUMPS] [SIGHS] Put the gun back in the cop's hands. Doctor. Now. Frankie's dead. You know where to find me. This feels good. Was it worth it? No. Jake. LINDA: Jake! [SIRENS WAILING] Jake, wake up! Your people. They have no code. No honor. I was a fool to have trusted you. It's only business. [CHOKING] [DOGS BARKING IN THE DISTANCE] JAKE: One night we snuck into the corner of... All of a sudden, we had $500. It was like winning the lottery. [HAMMERING] We were just kids. What started as a need became a habit. I did a lot of shit I wish I could take back. But you can't. 'Cause no matter what you do, where you go, there you are. Maybe that's what my father meant. Close to the world but not of the world.
