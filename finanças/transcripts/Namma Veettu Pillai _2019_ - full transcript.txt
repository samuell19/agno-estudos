The thing is, he flooded the government with petitions Our defense is that we will open the wine shop after 12 noon Their counter defense is that, the liquor is available since 6 AM through backdoor Our defense is that, the bar and wine shop is shut at 10 PM Their counter defense is that, the liquors available in black market after 10 PM He also adds that, those who buys in black market, settles at schools late night and get drunk on top of all this things, The used cups are mixed with drinking water and makes it nasty Remember the Diwali offer banner? those who drinks above Rs. 1000 will be selected randomly and offered with Fridge, TV or Grinder He filmed a documentary about this and showed to Judge, with caption - A FILM BY ARUMPON - What should we do Uncle? - What were you doing till now? Just chill Client, the judgment is not to have wine shop in the city limits I'm suggesting to shift bar and wine shop outside the city limits All our customers will reach the spot by any means, got it? Thus, no case can stop our income! I don't run this shop for money, It's my pride to have a shop in the city - Pride? huh! - My nephew was earning through that bar! Running a Bar, Cattle feeding and owning a Marriage hall are all rich men's pride and they are trying to spoil that He has already spoiled your reputation Arumpon and Petition Paramu! Uncle, it's been five years and the ritual is incomplete Shall we complete the ritual ? I feel that's the reason for bad things happening to Tulasi If you feel so, let's offer prayer and complete rituals On top of it, - We will come to know.. - Who all will attend! Check with your uncles for their availability, let's finish it before the horse function. Let's not humiliate Tulasi in the name of rituals, check with her once I'm in, at least I'll be showered with gifts Dear son, for a change, we are going to have feast! - Only feast? - Off course Based on our petition, Court shuts down all the wine shops Sons! Why are you getting into such unnecessary things? Be careful guys, they are petty minded people - being righteous may.. - get us into trouble Brother, Fresh stock. - How is the sales of our Tulasi brand? - going well - You want some more - No, will take it next week - Bro, I came to your house and uncle was not there - That's good news, right? Bro, I want to talk about the ritual prayer - Yes Uncle? - What are you planning to do? Uncle, they should know what fear is. Hey, we all are related and this will create more trouble So don't complicate things, - but Uncle, - First let's try to compromise through his Uncle - was he angry? what you told him bro? - Nothing serious bro. Good one bro! - Hey, do you have CPR brand sesame oil? - No, we have only Tulasi brand sesame oil - Don't mention about that cheap product! Better shut down your store! The district collector has ordered, so better shut down the store! Again! Good one bro! Why would you do the rituals for her? I will attend for your sake sister, But won't be part of ceremony Why not brother? We are not responsible for your husband's wrongdoing and people will speak ill about us, Aunty, Veg-stew is superb! Brother's opinion is correct, We would have participated if it were your own daughter, Will you do it or not? - ok! - fine! Why didn't you consult with me first? Your mother discussed with her brothers first and then only came knocking my door You are mistaken uncle, I came to your house first, - You were not in home - Is it so? You are behaving exactly like your dad! At least he's stepping up for something, what about you? But, Why should your uncle participate in the ceremony? - They confirmed their participation - Is it so? I will attend, but will not participate - This is not fair - Your husband always put money over relationship! - Get lost! - You too! Your father's presence alone will grace the ceremony! His absence will be even more graceful! - What? - I'm at marriage hall, let's discuss about it. I would have thrashed him if he was not related to us. Bro, just chill, take it slow. I registered that squatter land with your help when you were the panchayat leader. That's the reason I'm having this conversation with you. Please warn your sons My son is innocent. It should be his cousin. I will look into it. I keep telling everyone that two grooms are competing for my daughter, in reality they are not even ready to participate. They will participate and one of them will marry Tulasi Don't worry, I won't leave them. I will prove my worth. Mass bro! However you try, you will fall short of your Father's height! It has become a habit for people to compare father and son. Yes dad, that comparison is pretty stupid. Bro, Just be cautious while going out - But I always take you with me - Not anymore! First we are going to elder uncle house and then to the younger uncle house. - Bro! - huh, the comic police! How are you bro? - I'm good, how is Video coverage... - Business going on? - It's alright uncle - Sit, what's up? What my father did maybe wrong, Please participate for the sake of your sister My mom will be happy if her brothers and her nephews participate in the function I had bought the gifts, all you have to do is participate in the function and offer blessings for my sister - Guys, support me - Dad, we owe aunt at least this much Also Tulasi deserves your blessing dad Fine, I will present the gift bought by you, But your mom shouldn't think about getting Tulasi married to one of my sons That's the deal, what do you say? I know that you wont accept Tulasi as your daughter-in-law, I already start searching groom for her Aren't we good enough? - Bro, PK and CK deserves more... - ...but not sure whether it's good - or bad - Kid, do you want to stay here - Nope, let's leave - Let's go home - This is the last stop Kid! It's a shame to make a future district collector to do household job HELLO! Hi Machi(friend), How are you? - Hey Collector, so when did you... - come from Chennai?

Don't spoil the marriage proposal! - Son-in-law - Uncle? Just imagine Maangani coming to our village as collector, - Let's raise our voice! - Till last breath! It'll be awesome! Wow!! Excellent Uncle! How about she signs the paper in the green ink? It will be in green colour It will be a proud moment Uncle! So make sure no one disturbs that goal! Uncle, everything will happen as per her destiny. - Lets think positive! - If not? Little Sharp tongue! go! Get lost! Ok, I will leave now and will come later... Uncle! Go and fetch your brother and his mom He's not allowing to take a sip! What's the matter bro? Did you call for us brother? - Hey, why did you bring everyone? - Just a precaution Are you rubbing shoulders in the name of social service? No Uncle, It's the school road and even the ladies finds it tough to cross on top they are supplying the liquors 24 hours for various occasions Is it so? - The black market price goes from Rs. 150 to.. - Rs. 250 - and all the dishes are... - pre-cooked and bad! - Dad - Will you please shut up! -Also they leave the bottles everywhere - lots of people getting hurt because of that Son, don't do this, you may invite trouble! Are you planning to enter Politics? We don't need to be in politics to stand up for issues, We are doing as little as possible for this society These questions about politics are actually keeping the good people away from the social issues Mass bro! Keep quiet Grandpa! Shut up! Guys, they will do anything to uphold their pride, be careful If they consider those things as pride, then we should be proud for what our brothers did! Why are you here? Tulasi, you go home! She's telling the truth! I'm directly benefited by shutting down the wine shop, so leave it brother Who will touch them when you are here? Don't ask me anything if something happens to them! Deal, don't ask us if anything happens to them! Yeah, deal!

Your love sizzles like water out of the sluice and fill me in jar! You are born for me! So, are you happy? Yes brother, happy. Did you notice that elder one neither came inside nor had food - yes, he left. - is it? What's the grievance? Kotravai, looks like good collection? Bro, you used to mock Maangani with names, But now your eyes are glued on her in front of whole world! What? Did Maangani came to the function? wow! I didn't see her wow! Enough bro, just be honest. It's unconditional love! - Unconditional huh? - Love! Love! Shut up, PubG maniac! It means, I love her even if she doesn't look at me or talk to me I just love everything she does, - I love her without any reason, if you scold her - then also he will love her How did you fall for her? When she went to Chennai for studies, I kept thinking about her but I keep doing my work and didn't disturb her - Not only talking, even thinking about her... - also called as LOVE! Good timing kid! This is too much my dear brother. Let's keep this as our little secret I won't bro! Great timing! when did you came bro? I'm here since the start - Is he loving me since 12th grade? - I think even before that He conceals his intention in front of everyone My dad clarified that my goal is to become the district collector I will become district collector and come to our village in Government Jeep Then skip it, He's an idiot to call it an unconditional love Unconditional love? You don't get distracted, your aim is to become district collector Hey, What is this? Avaram flower, good for health We mix this in Tea, keeps us away from diabetics, cancer Oh, I heard this before, Food is medicine, go traditional way, Don't fry, just boil, Your brother lectures this for hours, it's torture. Do you remember that you had short hair in 12th grade? My brother took rabbit's blood, soaked in white cloth and dried it,... ...then picked aloe Vera, mixed with coconut oil... for what? to make your hair strong and long You were delighted by the result, but now? You forgot everything? I remember now, I'm sorry dear. First, stop faking your accent - Are you here for donation for horse festival? - Yes sir, So, how much my elder uncle gave?

My dad is better than him, write Rs.25K Ok Sir.

I'm gonna kill you Don't disturb me! What's unconditional love? You told her? Well, it means I like you for no particular reasons Even if the whole world mocks you, - your uncle's watching you... - I know, but he isn't smart enough Even, If you fall for someone but realise I'm the better option, then also I will like you that's called unconditional love She looks like catla fish - Hey how are you? - I'm good thanks! - Bro - yes? - Maangani - what about her? - I want to get close - So? - Why don't you help me? - What? - I'm your brother, give respect - Ok bro, sorry! - Look there, start praying - I know. Acharya Devo Bava The issue is, this is agricultural land So he got stay order against selling it as commercial property Why are you staring at me? Looks like he sent this along with wine shop petition Unfortunately Judge noticed it now and gave stay order! Our defense is that, we claim that this is not used for farming for past 10 years But his counter defense is attacking my reputation in bar council and calls me fake He complained that I graduated through backdoor and made it personal Finally what I suggest is that, Book a suite in Le-meridian, I will brainstorm to file this case in high court - What I suggest is that, - Yes? - Just shut up! - You will end up in Jail! It's gonna be tough to sell plots The buyers are scared about the legal issues Uncle and on top, we got a stupid lawyer Greetings!

I will tell you a secret, don't get upset and you should never tell mom - Ok deal! - Uncle clearly told me that, He will never agree for the marriage proposal with his son How can I say this to mom, that's why I keep looking for options, ha ha ha ha ha Ha ha ha, he tried to pull my legs, but I escaped, ha ha ha - Great! super bro! - Yes, super bro! - Why bro? Bro, do you think mom heard us? Shall I go and ask her? Don't worry, she couldn't have heard She must have heard. - What do you think Grandpa? - She couldn't have heard. - What if she heard it? - rightly said!

Tulasi, ask your husband to finish the house soon, Let me know if he's running short of cash, I'll organise Tulasi, tomorrow we are going to my uncle's house for feast - Looks like he takes eating a serious business - Will you shut up kid? Tulasi, the engine sound is not good, I think it needs to be serviced Mom, take your son to a good doctor. Also add some salt in his food. We are all consuming chemicals in the name of salt Only the raw salt is good for health. So you take that Tulasi. Let's leave mom. - Bye Aunty - Bye Sister Every mother feels this pain right? Not all grooms are like this son, - He didn't even welcome you - He welcomed you, that's sufficient mom. Take good care of him Tulasi is there to take care of him Then, What did your brother in law told you? He said he will give money for the house construction. He will give money today and will take advantage tomorrow, Should I lose my respect and stand in the corner? or outside? - Why are you talking like this? - Then what are we here for? Should you build house on his money? I will organise Rs.5 Lakhs by selling some gold, you finish the construction Uncle, Already your situation is worse, people are already asking to refund for the land sales money!

Take this, Finish the work in 2 months for house warming ceremony So you married for the sake of your uncle? - So it's all planned? - No no, not like that. You guys asked 'May I come in?' and I said 'Ok Welcome' I like you a lot, but I hate your brother. - Why you don't like him? - Yes, ask him why? Tell me how to sort this out. Is it? They incurred few crores loss to my uncle, Ask them to meet my uncle and sort it out, now stop talking about brothers. Bad habit! Earlier, people used to visit and pay their respects, but today, the same guys are asking for the refund Either I should run away or sell this marriage hall to clear debts If you withdraw the case, It will be good for all That's not possible, please let us know what else we can do? What's in it for you? I will give you a share, so cooperate with me on this. Grandpa, were you hiding? hey, who asked you to come here? So, everybody is inside only! I told you clearly and you keep repeating the same mistake It was filed long back, but only recently we got the judgement. More than him, the buyers are suffering a lot! - It's all hard earned money son! - Yes, I heard you too got 2 plots in it. - Did you bought in Aunty name or someone else? - Shut up idiot.

First tell me who are all there in the call, then let me confirm Anybody can say anything, but why would you say that? Why dad? bye! What a performance!

Oh my magnetic eye beauty! If you are not inviting my brother for house warming, then let's not invite anyone You, me, your parents and your uncle are sufficient. It's all my hard earned money? Why shouldn't I celebrate it grand? Then invite my brothers as well, No, he's a bad omen for me. This house was incomplete for more than four years, your uncle didn't help at that time? Only when my brother wants to help, your uncle gave you money My uncle built this house for his sister, even you don't have any rights in this. - What? I will invite my brother - Yes, go ahead and do that, If he comes for the function, I will swear at him! Don't mention about your brothers again Won't you guys support me? - Hey, call your uncle. - Call him - Tell me son, - It's me, your brother! Tell me brother! Did you got any invite for Tulasi's house warming ceremony? - Arumpon is here, asking us to come - No brother, They don't want us to come He just want to insult Arumpon, He invited the entire neighbourhood except us! As if he has built a palace, I don't give a damn about this. Just leave it bro, If I want to go then need to apply leave with loss of pay, then need to spend on gift. So it's better this way! - Ok, inform our relatives not to attend the function then - Sure brother, will inform everyone Is Arumpon there? You didn't pay interest yet to Arunachalam? - I will pay after Housewarming ceremony - Fast guys, he keeps calling me. If we skip the function, then this will become routine. We shouldn't leave our rights Absolutely right! So, you want us to get humiliated there? Our relatives won't come, Let's go and offer our respects without anyone noticing Why should we do that in secret? No one will participate against your uncle's words Then let's take all our labours, they are always there for us - I'm also in - You will be leading us Grandpa! Great, Very good signs! - Take care of everyone one - Yes sure The labours are carrying the plates! Welcome Brother! - Welcome brother, mother - How are you ? Welcome grandpa, welcome all - You said you didn't invite them - I didn't, that shameless guy came on his own. I will take care of him Do whatever you want after I leave Uncle, where are you leaving? It's auspicious day and Pari agreed to pay advance for the marriage hall sales Tulasi, the house looks pleasant I was not expecting you brother, I didn't even have the courtesy of inviting you, and on top I asked you not to come, I don't need an invite for your house function, sister! Welcome all,welcome! - Tulasi, give them milk - I'm happy about the house. Son, don't do it. Such an auspicious day and don't want to see blood Brother, Let's have food. No, I'm already full with milk. Organise a feast and invite us, we will come. Grandpa, have some food please. No worries dear, take care. Please ignore my husband's behaviour. He may not like us, but we will never ignore him, Just be happy sister, bye. Nobody can win a person who is ready to lose. He's upset, you better leave fast. - Sorry bro, I coudn't come! - That's fine bro. - Why did you go there Grandpa? - Why Uncle? I told you not to go, what's the point in attending the function? Our survival is not based on your income, If you want to stay here, you better live by my rules! - Aunty, Grandpa is leaving us, - Let him leave, He likes Arumpon more than us, let him go - Grandpa, please forgive dad, stay back please - No way See how my Dad goes behind him, They both have planned this. - Wait until I send you away the same way! - Ha, you are my legacy! Brother! I never expected to buy your marriage hall! Take care! Best wishes! Good, alright! Count this and store it. - It will help in your marriage expense - Leave it Grandpa! What happened? Break-up? Grandpa! no issues with Maangani, but I doubt whether Uncle will agree. - Hello - Brother, Please don't tell anyone Your brother in law slapped your sister and she's unconscious now. - What? - True brother! - They took her to hospital - Which one? - Patient name Tulasi, what's the room number? - one second sir! - She's not here - Sorry bro, She's admitted in Janaki hospital - Tell me the truth! - I swear bro! What you did to Tulasi? Did you roam a lot? Congratulations, You will soon be an uncle! Brother, I just thought of calling you now, I only asked my guys to call him, - Oh is it! - I'm so happy Tulasi My blessings Your responsibility is doubled now! I told my Uncle and he told me this is not right time for baby Brother, what were you both discussing about? We were just discussing about the baby - So when are you going to get married - Hopefully soon. Congrats wish you the same! It took time to escape my father's fort You are already late! - Don't get irritated if a girl comes late - is it? - At the same time, don't make her wait, got it? - Yes sure! - You should like my arrogance - Ok, then, - You should convince your mother if she's not happy about me - OK - If we go for shopping, you shouldn't let me pay - Don't worry, I wouldn't let you go for shopping - You shouldn't complain about my lipstick - I wont Good, you shouldn't see the 'last seen' status and argue with me Ok, also won't ask anything even if you turn off 'last seen' - Correct! - Good lord!

What did I tell you? - Hey, will you agree for everything? - Yes, I will Don't worry, All the best for your exams! I believe you will pass the exams! If the marriage will distrub your vision, then I will wait. I want to become Collector, and then marry you We owe that much to Tulasi. She endured all this for us! I will buy it for you, - Aunty - Tulasi - Yes brother - What happened? - Nothing brother, I'm not feeling well - What happened? - What happened sister? - Nothing brother Then why are looking sad? I can't be happy like you, I had to laugh, cry, stare, sleep without any complaints, because I'm woman! We treat woman as god, tell me what happened? - Why is your face swollen? - Just mind your business brother! I just conceal everything and exist here, You warned me about this guy, but I ignored you! Just stop it, What the hell happened Aunty? - I mean... - Just tell us - Who are you guys? - We need three whiskey bottles - Why are you asking it here? - We bought from here several time, - The shop opens at 12 noon only, but they sell here - What's this Aunty? If I see you guys again, I will thrash you all. Hey, You cheapsters shouldn't show any pride! Let's get it from springhead! What's happenning here? Where's the stock aunty? What is this? Sir, Please spare the lady! She's pregnant, please spare her, Please Sir, spare her Dear, Please forgive me, Please give it to me My brother warned me for this only. Aren't you ashamed of this work? Aren't you ashamed of your birth! - Be careful, If you speak ill about my birth - Shut up! Do you think she got no one to look after? COME! I keep forgiving you but you are taking too much of advantage COME! It's 12:01 noon and why isn't the shop opened yet? Redecorating the shop! Can't you do that later? How dare you slap a pregnant lady? Hey, Stop it! I asked my sister to be patience but not at the cost of self respect - You humiliate everyone, shall I do the same now? - Hey, leave me alone! - Shall I? - Don't do it! I spare you for the sake of my sister So, What's your plan for revenge? I think he'll pass away before planning! Looks like Pilot car! huh, this guy! Why is he with gang? Welcome Pari bro, you came to console him? Please take your seat! - Why are you drinking? - Nothing This is the first time he's drinking in his life, so just imagine the pain! - Bad timing mate - Sorry bro! He's already humiliated by his brother in law, and you are provoking him, Not just humiliation, he has totally spoiled his reputation Why are you shouting at him? He's just brutally honest. Just don't piss me off, get out. - Why are you showing you anger at an innocent? - Who is innocent? Roaring lion! I came here with gang to thrash your brother in law. - Come let's go - Not needed, get lost Not needed? hey, Look here mate! Hey Your Uncle can't clear debts and wrote off all the wealth in my name and you are asking me to get lost? So, you came here to insult me? Just get out guys! Whom are you asking to leave?

Where is he? Brother, Pari's men came home searching for you They hit Anbu in the commotion, you stay alert All are with you only right? Take care of them. Is it still paining? Don't worry, the pain will reduce Uncle, one thug broke my head. You came here to see whether we are alive? Shut up, Do you have any idea how much trouble we are in? Get out! - Get out! - Dad! You carry on Your dad did the same thing and he died soon Brother, he's our younger one. He will also have the same fate! If you don't behave yourself, you will be gone soon I never crossed limits, I always consult with you all So you never disobeyed us? You always do the opposite! Is this how you respect us? Since the day her parents entered our house, we have issues and now she's the trouble maker I told your mother to leave her in orphanage, - Your mom never listened to us - Brother, please don't be harsh Son, you better leave, the whole village is waiting to see our family split What are you staring at? I will slap you! - Son, you are crossing your limits. - I don't think so? He's the one stands in front for all the festivals and ceremonies, Are you competing with me? You will never change! How can I compete with you Uncle? You are much ahead of us after my father's death I'm nobody, I couldn't even perform last rites for my father I believed that I will remember my father through you all But have you ever treated me fair atleast once? You won't even step into my house, I asked for a financial help, but he's collecting interest through third person I didn't feel offended, But now I realise that, you all were treating us like orphans and not relatives I like my uncles a lot, But, even they were not ready to accept marriage proposals You too, We never did anything without your knowledge But you did a lot without our knowledge, Including, stopping Tulasi's marriage. Had you agreed for the marriage, We wouldn't be running like this, You will never understand our pain, your father is still alive But, for me, I lost my father, and she lost everyone. I promised that I will take care of her, Do you want me to quit on her? Not only Tulasi, I would be doing the same for anyone here Are we there to only share happiness? Only our grandfather looked at us like relatives My mom is very cautious in our upbringing, and we try hard to live upto her expectation We don't expect your sympathy, but atleast don't add more pain to us We will be able to survive on our own There's no point in competing with you, You keep going in the front as usual, We will just happily follow you, However you insult us, We keep roaming around to earn your affection I'm sorry If I had insulted you Kid, I'm sorry. I will take care of this problem I will solve this issue on my own Don't cry, I really can't see you crying, Please don't lose hope Don't mind all this. I will also come with you Uncle Not this time my dear Kid. Brother, Arumpon is at our temple gates with his family - What are you telling? - True brother! Get ready guys, We will kill him today. Hey, you saved your brother in law... ...and entered our village without any fear? - You have spoiled my sister's life - I will kill you all now! Let's see who will save you. I beg you all, please don't beat him - Hey, Stop it guys- I wont spare anyone, Leave me guys They have surrendered themselves in front of our panchayat... Let him explain first Yes, proceed Let's listen to them first! What my brother in law did is stupidity I saved him so that no other life is lost I know the value of life I understand that family's pain Please tell us what we need to do for redemption Your brother in law didn't kill him This guy killed him He will surrender and confess to Police Your brother in law confessed for money My whole village will support that your brother in law is innocent So, you bring your brother in law outside I will chop him to pieces I will kill him We will live peacefully after seeing his blood Is it fair to have an eye for an eye? Look at her, she's pregnant Do you want her to face the same fate like your sister? I don't care about your daughter's life Ask me anything apart from my brother in law's life What do you mean? You want to settle this with money? Are you showcasing your richness? I want him only and nobody leaves until he come here. No one from your village can enter here, Let's wait for your brother in law I came here and kneel down in front of you doesn't mean that I 'm scared If I'm scared, I would be alone You have no idea If I stand up in this issue It wont take more than couple of minutes to thrash you all and walk away Hey, how dare you, They are the affected, so I didn't hit back Others don't have that advantage I'm not here for fight I know the pain of my sister and also can understand the pain of their family I have seen my mom in the same situation, I have experienced that kid's emotion I know the pain of widowed mother I have experienced all this things My mom always address me as saami(god) but she's the real god She faced all troubles and brought us up the only reason she's kneeling down in front of you all is, the respect we pay for the affected family Please understand that, How dare he can hit us! Don't you guys get it? I don't want to lose another life in the name of revenge No one have rights to kill and not necessarily a lost life is compensated with another life Mom, get up. Tulasi, get up. I know it's this is wrong time to ask this, But If you wish, I will marry you and accept your kids Brother! Not immediately, take your time Thank you. You are a big hearted. Why should I punish you for someone else's mistake His fate ended in this way His time has come, that's it. There's no point in holding grudges My husband and myself blessed this girl for happy life I can't spoil her life! I request our people to send them away with respect That's enough for me and my husband will truly rest in peace Sister - Oh my dear - Please get up Please get up You have lots of relatives in our village You are always welcome there. I will come and meet you often is it fine? Goodbye Son! You have raised above your father today! You are making me owe more - Uncle, it's Maangani's baby showering - What? I mean, Tulasi's baby showering, brother in law also coming in parole Thought of doing it big, need some money Can you please organise some funds through your friend? - Why ? I will give you son - I will pay back the interest promptly. - welcome son - Hello aunty It's our house function son, careful sister, - So Maangani, when will you become collector? - Soon bro. I will take you to a good doctor after marriage - Son in law - Yes Uncle? - No party? - No pocket! The kid is crying, will you shut up please! Shall we conclude? A FILM BY PANDIRAJ! I will share the womb to be your brother, all the time I will share the womb to protect you like a Mother, all the time
