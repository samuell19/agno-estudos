And so Kevin, this friendly cheerful young man we all knew and loved who found unimaginable resources of strength and courage on the field of battle I think all of us in this village have every reason to be proud of him. Time and again like the good shepherd he went back up the mountain to search among the shellfire and the bullets for those friends of his still lying wounded in the freezing snow. Greater love hath no man than this that a man lay down his life for his friend. For all of us, I'm sure, his spirit will live on. Verily, verily, I say unto you the hour is coming and now is when the dead shall hear the voice of the son of God and they that hear shall live. They that have done good unto the resurrection of life they that have done evil unto the resurrection of damnation. Denzil. Look here what we got. Can you help me? He's English. - Is it all over? - The war? War's been over seven weeks. Where you been all this time? I've been trying to find a way back. I thought we were still fighting. Poor lamb. I best give them another ring. Well, you can't stay here. What name was it, Deakin? Get someone over here to pick you up. Here. Eat that. - Ta... Ted? You're back then? It's me. The war is over, isn't it? They've not been having us on? Yeah. - I thought you were an Argy at first. I've got a lost soldier here. - Gave me a fright. Bloomin' Argies. - Yeah, English. You showed 'em though? - He thinks the war's still going on. Deserve a medal for what you all did. Coming over here and saving us like that. Heroes I reckon you are. All of you. Heroes. Seventy-three minutes. They'll come out at night for a lost soldier. You try getting them out here to clear up them minefields. Four sheep I've had blown to bits so far. Flaming war! Sooner it's all cleared up and back to normal the better. I couldn't help it, I got lost. We'd, we'd just brought someone from that platoon down. Johnny Fodden. He had a bad head wound. Then, then we went back up the ridge Then after that you don't remember anything? No, Corp, not for three days. How did you know it was three days? I was soaked. I'd eaten all me rations. I don't know. It's all a blank, you know. It felt like three. So what about this shack then? How do you think it come to be stashed full of army rations? I think... I think some of our spotters had been there. Cooling down fire. It looked like they'd, been discovered and run off. And you stayed there for seven weeks? - I didn't know what to do, Corp. I thought I'd stumbled behind enemy lines. You realise they surrendered six hours after you'd gone missing? No, sir. Did it never occur to you that it was all over? No, sir. - No guns, no sound, no smoke? So you thought we were still fighting? - I couldn't be sure. Didn't you notice any helicopters foot patrols out looking for you? We spent ten days looking for you, Private Deakin. I never saw anybody, sir. Neither did we. It's Johnny. Johnny Fodden Johnny Fodden. Where's that fucking medic? Christ. Johnny! Keep awake. I thought you were awake. You look like you've seen a ghost. What's it feel like to be a hero? Hero who came back from the dead. That's what they're calling you in the papers back home. Things'll never be the same again. - Mr Deakin? - Yes. Captain Sinclair, Army Welfare. My wife. - Mrs Deakin. Tuck in behind me, would you? We, we're not going outside then? We thought a big crowd of people might be rather trying for you under the circumstances. Lots of strangers pointing and asking questions. We've rustled up something a bit more intimate. More of a family occasion. I see. - It's, it's all all right, is it? - Of course, Mr Deakin. Just, just wondered like, you know, with us, ...being kept apart from everyone, you know. - Not at all. Your son's been very brave. I'll bring him in the moment they arrive. Do start. Or it'll get cold. - Thanks very much. - Aren't I going to be able to use me banner, dad? - I don't know, kid. - What they doing leaving us in here? - I don't know. Best do as the man says anyway. Private Deakin? - Yeah. - This way please. What are you going to do now? Is it true you deserted? - Did you desert, Kevin? - No. What happened in the inquiry? Did the army think you'd deserted? You'll all get a chance later. Kev! Kev! - Kev! - Get off! Alive Falklands battle hero given up for dead is back. While his parents grieved the latter day Lazarus wandered in the wilderness living on shellfish and worms. Kevin's father, forty-five-year old Mr Robert Deakin said yesterday it's a miracle. We still can't believe he's safe and well. Did you really eat worms, Kev? It said in the papers you ate worms. Don't believe all you read in the papers, I told you. Trust them to turn up. Smell a free drink for miles that lot. They're all right. They should have joined up like you. Make something of their lives instead of hanging about street corners all day. Bill two pints. - Good piss-up tonight? Aye haven't had a night like this since '66 World Cup. That's Mick Speight's sister, isn't it? Yeah. Didn't recognise her with her clothes on. Have you missed me? Of course I have. Kevin. A few souvenirs from the grave for you. Never realised it was such a big do. Well, it's not every day we lose someone in battle. Kevin where is Kevin? Kevin come on son. Let's have, let's have a shot of the hero. Go on. Come on, Kev. Come on, come on Kev. Come on get over here. Get round the back there. Round the back, that's right. - That's my girlfriend. - Don't get camera shy. Come on, look cheerful, Kevin. Give him a kiss. - We know all about you now, Kevin. - What have you been telling them? Did you kill any? Can't tell. You know, I was just giving cover fire. - So how come you were stretcher bearing then? I volunteered. Got bloody frozen just lying there. - Anyway, what you been doing? - Watching it every night. On tele, in pub. - Hey, we got rotten the night it finished, didn't we? - Yeah. I couldn't get over how young they all looked. Argies. It was pathetic. Just kids half of them, they've never they've never, never been out of their own village before, you know they've no stomach for fighting. It's tragic. Unaccustomed as I am to public. No, no, seriously, seriously lads. I'd just like to say how delighted we all are to have our Kevin back home with us safe and sound. Now, they say that absence makes the heart grow fonder, well ours did. And from the look of those two lovebirds over there I wouldn't be surprised if I was up here speech-making again in a couple of- Well, it's, you know it hasn't been an easy time for Carol and me the last few weeks. You know, all we had to cling onto was that, you know as long as there wasn't a body like, there was still a ray of hope, you know. Ten to one but there it was. And now, all our dreams have come true, our wildest dreams have come true. And I'm not only glad that Kevin's back, I'm proud. I'm proud of what he did, I'm proud of what he did for I'm proud, I'm proud of what he did for his country and this village. I don't know, well you couldn't have been more marvellous, thanks a lot. Thanks. Thank you very much. So let's have a tune: Rule Britannia. Britons never never never shall be slaves. Britons never never never shall be slaves. It's funny how they never teach you the rest of Rule Britannia. Yeah. There's loads more verses you know. Perhaps the rest are even dafter. - Aye, you're miles away, aren't you? - No. - You've not been listening to a word I say. - I have. I have, I'm just just taking it all in, you know... ...being back. Come on. After weeks of waiting an agonising few moments delay smiling looking remarkably fresh after their three and a half thousand mile flight. Across the Atlantic Ocean His Royal Highness the Colonel... joyful reunion they've been dreaming about for so long. For half an hour... welcoming back their loved ones. Some laughing some... all of them glad to be reunited after a... Must have lost my memory more than I thought. then into the main terminal for a champagne breakfast they'll never forget. When you back at work? Two weeks. What shall we do? We can do anything. - I'm alive. - Certainly deserve their medal celebration. There you are, love. I never thought I'd be bringing you up a cup of tea again. Paper's are here. The bastards! I told you I didn't like it. I don't believe it. Jesus! Bloody papers! Perhaps they wondered why you stayed so long. You want to try finding your way back across them mountains. Without a compass. Freezing cold weather. Six hours daylight a day. I did try a couple of times. I was walking around in circles. But you got back eventually. Me food ran out. It were either find my way back or stay in that filthy shack and die. - You know, I mean what is this, an interrogation? - No. You shouldn't have egged me on to go down there in the first place... ...then it would never have happened. - What? You, you kept saying how proud you were of me before I went. Well, I was when I knew you had to go, but I didn't make you go, did I how could I? I go like everybody wanted me to then when I come back and I'm not the same, they all start complaining. Everything I say gets twisted. Can't even go in a pub without it being some kind of orgy. Not much hope of that with you these days, is there? Kevin. It's just a mystery to us. What you did all that time. I kept alive. You don't have time for much else. It's impossible. I can't... describe it what it were like. What did me mum and dad do? You know, when I were dead. They were upset. Your mother were off work for four weeks, compassionate leave. They went to a medium, you know. A medium? What for? They wanted to know how you were getting on, I suppose. What about you? We were all upset. It was so sudden. And then you came back. Do you wish I hadn't? Course I don't. You didn't run, did you Kevin? You can tell me if you did, you know, I'm not going to freeze you out. I didn't run. That's all right then. That's all I wanted to hear. - All in the past now anyway? - Yeah. All right, Bill? All right lads? - There you are. - Not too bad, not too bad. Been watching the cricket? Yeah, shocking. Just going to play on the machine. Your round I think, kid. How come you never asked what happened to me? You lost your memory, didn't you? Yeah. Well then no point asking. What's it like? - What? - Losing your memory. I forget now. You bugger. - Hey, hey, hey, hey watch your language, I'll be telling your mum. Kevin, you're hurting me! What's wrong? This! I should've stayed down there. No. No! Do you believe in ghosts? Perhaps that's what I am. I mean... I died, didn't I? - Kevin, that's it? - Yeah. He wants to know if Johnny's all right. We don't know any Johnnys. Johnny Fodden. His parents wrote to us. Kevin helped him down on the stretcher he had a head wound. He's all right, tell him. He says he didn't want to go to war. It's right. He says he never thought he'd have to fight when he joined up. - Well, none of them did. - That's not Kevin. It's true. He didn't want to go, he told me. He says, but don't be ashamed of him though. He found his guts in the end. He's getting very faint. Don't go Kevin speak to me. - Kevin! - I'm sorry, love. He's gone, it's no good. I found that tape. That woman. - Who was she? - Woman in Manchester. Somebody at work told me about her. It were my idea, your dad didn't want to go. Only... I couldn't bear it not having anything definite. - Not knowing for sure. - Aye, well we weren't too certain after we'd seen her, were we? I mean, she weren't didn't know whether you were dead or alive. Just upset us more really. I still don't understand it to this day. It sounded so like you. But... how could she get through to you if you weren't dead? Got all her facts wrong. Kept talking about Bluff Cove but you weren't at Bluff Cove. What day did you see her? The first of August. The day you turned up at the farmhouse. That farmhouse wre in Bluff Cove. I told you there was something. So? Is that going to help us get back to normal? It's the future we should be thinking about. Getting back to normal. - He's to go back next week. - I know. You can't keep running away from things, you know. If you'd have come back sooner, we wouldn't have had to go through all this. Bob! Well. What were you thinking about all that time? Yeah, but you must have known you couldn't stay up there forever. You must have seen search parties out looking for you. - I mean, forty-eight days, didn't you? - And what war did you fight in? Kevin. You ought to try standing a few yards from a six inch shell when it goes off and see what it does to your memory. You should see what it does to your mates... arms and legs and bollocks hanging off. And you having to carry 'em and joke about it and pretend that they're all right. You should try it. What's going to happen to us, Kevin? I'll be back in November, it's not long. We can write. Yeah. You won't get lost again, will you? I'll try not to. - Kevin. - Chris. Army food not good enough for you now, Deakin? It's me bait. Very nice. You can go clean out the shithouse next. We're not doing this every day, Corp. Not now. No? Bit of glory gone to our heads, has it? It's knuckle down time now. Back to block jobs. Consider yourselves lucky you went down there. It's not everybody who'll be able to tell his grandchildren he was a hero back in '82. - Barracks square at ten. - Yes, Corp. Do you remember Georgie lying in the snow shouting I've lost my leg, I've lost my leg and Proven, Proven comes over and he says, no you haven't, old son, it's over there on that rock. Where have you been? On the phone talking to me girlfriend. - She wants to go to Marbella for honeymoon. - You what? Spick land? You may as well go to Argentina, you wanker. I want to go to Morecambe. What've you done? Shut up. Go back to fucking sleep. Switch on, lads. - Chimneys in summer. Got your medals all nice and shiny? Now it's back to work. Soldiers in peacetime are like chimneys in summer. - What do you do with them, Corporal Byker? - Sir. Deakin, pick your feet up We have to maintain their soldierly discipline while maintaining the spirit that they had down there. - We have to work them hard, Corporal. - Sir. I've told you before, Deakin, get your fucking knees up. Come on, get your fucking knees up! This is a high performance machine. - You have to drive it hard. - What do you think you're doing, fucking treading grapes? Pick your fucking feet up! Bonner, you twat. Odd speck of grit in the works. Eyes right, don't look at me, I'm not in uniform. - It'll flush it out on its own. - They like to be worked hard, sir. - Keep 'em fine tuned, we'll be ready for the next one. - Yes, sir. Well back to the mess accounts. The important things in life. - Pick your fucking feet up! - Corporal Byker So the city salutes the Falklands Task Force. As representatives of all the service men involved march past the Prime Minister, the Right Honourable Mrs Margaret Thatcher and the Lord Mayor, Sir Anthony John. Mrs Thatcher is looking as fresh as ever. Today wearing a black suit and white... looks up at the sky... Maggie. Are we on it? Look there's Deakin. - Where? - There. Sorry. It's a nurse off the Uganda. He's here all the time. Have you found it yet, Deakin? - What's that? - Your memory. Have you got a frog in your throat? Bloody hell, Slaven! It looks more like a worm. Pass the salt. Better ask Deakin about that. He's the, worm expert around here. What's your problem, Slaven? Actually, it couldn't be a worm, could it? It would've been eaten by now. If you've got something to say, say it. Otherwise, leave me alone. My problem, Deakin is that a bagshite like you who runs off for seven weeks and then gets allowed back in here. And you were brave, were you? Hiding behind rocks while people were lying with their heads shot open. Don't you say things like that to me, you fucking little tossjohn! Nine of our mates were being buried down there while you were fucking scoffing worms well out of it. It should've been you we were laying flags over, not them. - I'm gonna fucking brain you! - Lay off him, Slaven. - He gets what's coming to him. - I said lay off him! There was an inquiry. He was cleared. Now just let it go. You listen. You get out of here fast if you know what's good for you. Get this lot cleaned up. You never said you were coming. I thought I'd surprise you. You're drunk, Kevin. So much for getting married? No, it's not like that. Anyway, you not seem so keen. I can't not get on with my life while you're away. Evidently! It's not been the same since you came back. Me big mistake, weren't it that... coming back? You're in a world of your own half the time. And I've been confused, I'm... I'm not sure it could work anymore. You think I ran too? No, it's not what I think that matters. Now, if we were to get married and we stayed here I'd be tarred with the same brush and I don't think I could stand it. - We'll live somewhere else. - Where? In a barracks? I'll leave. And where, where would we live, what job could you get? Julie, you coming or what? What you waiting for? You, Kevin. Come on. You, like you were before this happened. Can I have a burger, please? I'm celebrating me return. Aren't you glad to see me this time? Or would you all have been a lot happier if I'd stayed dead? You could've had, you could've had your, your plaque on the church wall then. You'd have had your village hero your bit for the Falklands. That's all you were interested in, not me. Just an embarrassment, aren't I now? If I'm not a hero, then I must be a deserter well I'm neither. Bloody stupid pointless war. No-one's saying you're a deserter. Then why rip them pages out of that book like it hadn't never happened, like it never existed? Because it makes you all look ridiculous, that's why. Come on, Kevin. You don't know what happened down there, none of you. You were all here watching it watching it on on settees, on tele. Come on, let's get you back. - Sorry about this. - Don't apologise for me. You're a load of hypocrites! You've used me! Come on, love. What do you expect? They were laying the red carpet out for him three months ago, now he goes and does this. - Does what? Comes back? - You know what I mean. If he thought they were glad to see him one minute and turning their backs on him the next. There's something going on he's not telling us about. Just tells the whole damn village and shows us all up. Well, if you hadn't had pushed him into the army like you did. Yeah, I know, all my fault isn't it? Damn war! I hope they're happy now they've got their island back. He can knuckle down. Surrender! No. Surrender! Never. Surrender. Surrender. What's this? Where's Trevor these days? I don't play with him anymore. Why not? He says you ran. What did you say? I came home got a jar of me dad's Brylcreem took it to school next day and made him eat it. - Brylcreem? - Yeah. Why Brylcreem? Keep his tongue in place. Kev, when you go back, will you bring me some more empty cartridge cases? I'll think about it. The grounds of Buckingham Palace where this afternoon the stage for the final sitting of the Falklands Campaign as thousands of proud servicemen lined up to receive their South Atlantic medals. The medals specially struck for every man and woman who served in the Falklands Campaign will surely be amongst the most prized of military decorations. The Campaign, one of the most successful ever waged in modern history has already made its mark on the British people. And the soldiers, sailors and airmen march towards the Palace their families and other well-wishers went out in force to cheer them along. My medal! I'm going to celebrate this. I'm either going to shaft someone or shoot someone before tonight's out. Joke time, joke time. Argentinian goes into recruiting office wants to join up. Recruiting sergeant he says, how would you feel with twenty British marines bearing down on you with their bayonettes fixed and their eyes glaring? He says, I'd run like fuck. He says, Sign here, you're just what we need. Impression time, this week. We've got all these amazing little creatures we find grubbing about in some really disgusting things like grubbing about, we find this really timid little creature which scurries, scurries about from rock to rock called the Kevin Deakin. - Let's get the bastard. - Where is he, the bastard. Give the son-of-a-bitch a good shafting. - What's going on? - We've come for Deakin. No! We've a right to know what happened, Corporal. You know what happened. We know we followed you into that battle and he didnt, we want to know why. It's in the past. Forget it. You might have had your inquiry, we want ours now. - And what's that going to achieve? - We'd know. Once and for all. Ten minutes. But we do this properly. Well, well, well. - You should have stayed at home, Deakin. - What do you want? Are you going to tell us the truth this time? You bagshite! Raise your right hand. You're going to tell us everything. Repeat after me: I swear by the colours of my regiment I swear by the colours of my regiment to tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth so help me Jesus. so help me Jesus. Private Kevin, Robert Deakin. You're accused of deserting under fire during the advance on Stanley and bringing disgrace into your regiment. How do you plead? Guilty or not guilty? - Not guilty! There was an inquiry. - Just answer the questions. Where were you on the night of June the 13th, 1982? On the mountain in the advance. So how come, if you were advancing, you suddenly decided to fuck off in the opposite direction? It took our unit 48 hours to regroup after that battle. It was snowing, there was people all over the place. I wasn't the only one to get lost. I've told you, I lost my memory. Memory be bollocked! You went off cos you were shit scared. That's not true! So how come you were in this shack for 48 fucking days instead of returning to your unit? - You didn't lose your memory for that long. - I thought we were still fighting. All the more reason to go back. Fact is, Deakin you lost your bottle. You didn't know what to do. Where were you then? Shacked up with some farmer's wife? - No. All right, Deakin. Stand down. Call Private Hibbert. Where was you on the night of June the 13th? - In the advance on Stanley, sir! Did you, Private Hibbert, by any remote chance, happen to observe anyone down at the staging post running around like a scared rat no use to any fucker, least of all the wounded ...men he was supposed to be looking after? - Yes, sir, I did. Does that person, Private Hibbert, by any remote chance, happen to be in this courtroom? - Yes, sir, he is. - Could you point that person out? - Yes, sir! I could. There is the little underpanted runt. Didn't Private Deakin's behaviour strike you as odd considering there was a battle going on? Not really, sir. He's always been a cringing, cowardly little prick. Came as no surprise at all to discover he'd gone off on a seven week camping holiday. Thank you Private Hibbert. Any more witnesses? You saw him, Slaven. We were there. Hibbert was there. And he wasn't running round like a scared rat. He'd just saved Johnny Fodden's life if you remember. Johnny Fodden can't testify, he's lying in the hospital with half his brain missing. And he wouldn't even have half a brain if it hadn't been for Deakin. So how come he did a runner... if he was so brave? You were in that battle, Slaven, you know it's not that simple. - It could have happened to anybody. - It didn't though, did it? It happened to him. All right, Slaven, you've made your point. You've had your trial. Now let him go. We want a verdict. This isn't an SIB whitewash job in time for the big homecoming, Corporal. We want justice. Come on, Deakin, let's stop fucking about now, admit you did a runner. I never ran. - A shell landed, all hell broke loose, you saw you chance and took it. - That's not true. - Admit you ran. - I don't remember what happened. - Admit! It were like I'd gone through a curtain. Like a dream. Cut the poetry, Deakin, just tell us straight. I can't remember! We're gonna get you, Deakin. If not tonight some other time. I think you're going to have to tell them, Private Deakin. This isn't going to go away. We have to know now. Admit you were scared. No! Johnny! - I thought I saw Johnny. - Where? On the mountain. Just before the explosion. He was down at the staging post, you twat! I know. I thought he were he dead. I thought he was dead and come to get me. I thought that were it. I was scared. You bottled it all right, Deakin. You brought shit onto this regiment. It weren't like that. - Private Hibbert! - Sir? Take this deserter for a regimental bath. With pleasure, sir. Let's fix this fucking hero. I never said I was a hero. That were reporters. It could've happened to anybody. No! Open, swallow, swallow, swallow down you go. Scrub this filthy sod down. Brush. Get those brooms over here! Bastards! Bleach in the bath. Any kelp down there, Deakin? Any fish down there... you fucking little bastard? Right, that's enough! Get him out! Get him out! He'll be out before too long though, won't he? We're hoping so. He needs a lot of rest at the moment. He has been through a terrible ordeal. We want to do all we can now to help him make a complete recovery and ease him back into the outside world. There'll be no question of any stain on his character of course. And what'll happen to them that's been tormenting him? - An inquiry will be held, I can assure you. - Yeah? We're deeply sorry about what's happened to Kevin. Will that be a serious inquiry or the sort you gave him last summer? Times were very sensitive last summer. You should have had a proper investigation then if you suspected something. Give him a chance to clear his name in a proper court. You could have stopped all this happening. Why lie to everybody? Look we know he might not be a hero but just to wash your hands of him like this, he deserves better. Whether or not he's a hero doesn't really concern us. It never has. Whatever he did or didn't do that night on the mountain will always be something of a grey area but then let's face it, Mr Deakin, your son was never cut out to be a member of a regiment of this calibre in the first place. Was he? Here we are. Christ! What have they done to you? - Come on, Michael. - Leave me alone. You promised come on. It'll be all right. It'll be fine. Come on, I'll be with you. Okay. Were all these lads in the Falklands? In here. Listen, Kevin, we can help you, your mother and me. Never mind what other people think. You should, you should have said when you came home last. I couldn't carry on running away though, could I? Like you said. Well, it's me who's responsible. Got a lot of mending to do, haven't we? I knew what I were doing. Well, we got you back. That's all that matters to us. It were a trick miracle all right? Darling, why didn't you tell me you were coming? I got here as soon as possible. I thought it would be a bit of a surprise. A bit of a surprise! Darling, you look wonderful. That's funny, I was going to say the same about you. Can't think of anything to say. I've missed you so much. I know. It'll all come back gradually. Yes, there's plenty of time now. All the time in the world. I don't know about that, the war isn't over yet. It is for you, my darling. Douglas, please. Look, we'll talk about that later, shall we? God, haven't you had enough? Well darling, I'm still in the Air Force. And there's still a war on out in the Far East. All I want is just one last fling before it's all over. You make it all sound like a cricket match. Now, now. All right, Johnny? All right?
