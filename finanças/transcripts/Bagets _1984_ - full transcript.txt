Are we going to fool each other? Even back when our children were almost expelled, - We didn't hide anything from each other. - Oh, my goodness. Just take it, you can pay it in installment. Get it, so I can have some sales. That's already yours. Alright? I wonder why they called us. As usual, it's all about our uncontrollable brats again. Hey, Loyola, do you already have Loyola? Is that the memorial land for the dead? Yes, but I also have a land for the living right beside Loyola too. - You may now enter. - Oh, let's go, it's been a while. Let's go. Damn you, Mr. Domingo! - Alright! - [bell ringing] Run! Quick! Run! Hurry! No! I am not. But! I am giving you two choices. That! We'll pass your children. If! You will not enroll them here for their fourth year. And! If not, they'll fail, and be expelled too. Take! Your pick. Ladies. But, Mr. Domingo, it's hard to look for a school, who accepts transfer students. Especially that they are in their fourth year already. - That's right, sir, that's true. - Yes, indeed sir. That! Is not my problem anymore. - But-- - What a pain in the ass! Instead of feeling beautiful, you all make me feel ugly! And ever since you arrived here, you only brought problems to me. It's better when you were in Bacolod. Fix this already, you're so slow. Oh, my! Nancy! What the heck? Can you move faster? Put it all in the bag. [SPEAKING IN REGIONAL DIALECT] - Good morning, ma'am. - Oh my! They've been waiting for you at the set now. Our call time is at nine o'clock. Is he mad already? Oh, my-- - He might throw the script at me. - Most likely. Tell him, I'll follow quickly. - Is our service already here? - Yes. Alright, I'll follow. Just tell him I'll be there. - Okay, I'll be leaving now. - Okay. Who let him in? What if I was naked? Then he'll see? Didn't I tell you to lock the door? Oh, my goodness! Hello? Oh, it's Steve. Steve is on the phone. Hi, love. I've been waiting for your call. I understand. Yeah. Yes. I'll call you as soon as I get to the set. Can you kiss me? Even just here on the phone. [GIGGLING] I love you. You're the only one who ruined the tradition of your dad's family, Arnel. Imagine, from your great-great- great-great. From your great-great-great- great-great-grandfather. They all graduated from the same school. Oh, Arnel. I don't know why. But you simply always get me so upset. You are an embarrassment. You just wait... You just wait 'til I tell your daddy-- Oh, there you are, Ramon. Ramon, there's something I want to talk to you about. You know what your son just did? - Oh, my. We have to talk. - Not now, Ditas. - I'm late for my appointments. - But you don't understand, we have to talk. Okay? Not now, okay? See you tonight, take it easy. You sit here. And what do you suppose I should do with you now? Speak up! Say something! "Something." Felix. Don't you think I'm to blame, for what's happening to Alex? Oh, Virgie, what nonsense are you blurting? Because, I read yesterday. In a book by Sylvia McKinson. Parenting in the Twenty-First Century. McGraw-Hill Company, quote. Children of broken marriages will fully misbehave, as a way of showing their resentment and rebellion towards their parents. Unquote. It's all Rusty's fault, he wouldn't even visit his son. He is so busy with his mushrooms. And his cheap-looking Australian model. I don't know why. And he needs extra attention. Because he is the only child we had. You read too many books. Why don't you read cook books? So, that your dishes would improve. But, darling, I've tried. You know that. It's better that it happened, so you can stop your illusions. There is a public school out there, and it's free, why don't you bring him there? You're a social climber. Will you stop? Will you help me pay the rent of our house? We're three months delayed. I feel so ashamed to the owners of the apartment. - You're really slow. - Oh, my goodness! If I have money, I would have given it to you! You are really something. Go ahead and eat. There's food here. - We also have fried rice too. - Look at you. Karate is not in anymore. - Hey! What are you doing? - Aerobics is the thing. - You're watching already! - Aerobics! Hey! Our electric bill is so high. [PEOPLE CLAMORING] You're all unbelievable! I'm leaving this mess. What are you doing now? I'm really furious. Instead of eating... Hey, stop that. Maybe she has a shooting? That's impossible, I just phoned to her. - Yes, tomorrow. - Have you been waiting? Sorry, I'm late, traffic was so heavy. Don't be mad at me, darling. - I fetched my cousin here. - Yes, I'll do it tomorrow. This is Delia, my cousin. - She's a good mahjong player. - Hi! - Have a seat. - Sit down. - Of course, guaranteed. - Hey, do you know? Her child was expelled too, just like our children, but she managed to enroll him. What? Where? Really? Ah, yes ma'am, I will bring the contract tomorrow. - Where? - At the school of my mother. She was promoted as the prinicipal. Bring your children there. I'll back them up. - Mom. - What? [SPEAKING IN REGIONAL DIALECT] [SPEAKING IN REGIONAL DIALECT] [SPEAKING IN REGIONAL DIALECT] [SPEAKING IN REGIONAL DIALECT] So, how it's going to be? I'll see your children when the school opens. I hope that they will have a nice time here. - Okay? - "Wen!" What? I mean, when does the school open? On the 16th. Bro, this is my cousin. Tonton. - This is Adie. - Hey, Adie! - Arnel. - Dude. - That's Gilbert. - Hey. Did you know? He's breaking the record. He's been a fourth year for four years. He couldn't pass at all. The school pitied him, so they kicked him out. Thank you, that was a very wonderful introduction. By the way, it's vacation now, do you have any plans? None yet. Why? Do you guys want to go out of town? Want to go to Baguio? We have a house there. [MUSIC PLAYING] [LAUGHING] - Hey! Whoa! - Careful! - Go down! - Push! Push! - Faster, come on! - Push! - There! Come on. - Hey! Wait for me! Wow, dude! This is awesome. - Baguio! Alright! - Good morning, Mister Danny. Go down now. What are you doing? Why? What is it? House or church? That's a house, dude, my mom's house. Your mom's house? Where is your dad's house? Over there at the other mountain. That's too far, dude. - Wow, dude! Nice one! - Nice one, dude. - Nice one! - Nice one! We'll eat you alive. We'll roast you! Hey! - Fire! - Hey! Fire! Alright. My sunburn hurts. Nice one! [WHISTLING] Hey! Hi! By the way, I'm Arnel. - Nice-- Ouch! - Girls! You don't know those boys. - You? - That's ugly, let's go. - [SCREAMING] - Hi, girls! Loch Ness monster! We're very sorry! Miss, sorry. Give me that. - You're uncircumcised? - [SHUSHING] - I thought so! Hey! - Don't tell them! Stop! He's uncircumcised. Wait! Wait for me! [SCREAMING] [CAR REVVING] [SINGING] Hey! - I don't have money. - Again? - What for? - He wants to be circumcised! - [SHUSHING] - You're not yet circumcised? - Yes, dude! I saw it. - He's not yet cut? Don't say it out loud. - So, what? - Alright, I'll lend you, but hey, don't forget your debts. - Yeah, just put in my tab. - Don't mind it anymore, that's in now. Alright, dude, I got you! Hey, Topee! Topee! Stop! I said stop! Good thing I saw you. You came just in time. You know, Steve and I are going to live together. I'm going to stay in his house. I think this will be better for both us. At least, you'll have a chance to be independent. And for me, I'll be with Steve. Alright, bye. Topee, I really love him so much. I'll go crazy if I won't do it. Alright, bye again. Take care of your Aunt Nena, don't feed her too much. - Bye! - Okay, let's go! Bye! Be good. Hey! Prince Antonio! Where are you going? Inside, I'll take a rest. Aren't you even ashamed? You're ignoring me! Dad, I'm tired from our trip. Come here, help me and stop being so lazy. What's going on there? Your son here, he doesn't want to help me. Well, he shouldn't since he came home from his trip. Then he shouldn't! Alright, Tonton, get inside and rest. Oh, no, your back is wet. Go change your shirt. Hey, Gani! [SPEAKING IN REGIONAL DIALECT] [SPEAKING IN REGIONAL DIALECT] [SPEAKING IN REGIONAL DIALECT] Aunt Nena. When did mommy thought of doing this? Just now. Steve asked her over the phone. She said yes. Oh, my goodness! Hey, Topee! Don't underestimate your mom. What will you do if your mom is in love? You should be thankful that your mom is not like the other celebrities there. That they have to change partners every now and then. Your mommy chooses carefully. But once she finds the one. She is all out. Just like me. [GRUNTING] [screaming] [MUSIC PLAYING] Who among you is Gilber Gutierrez? I said, who among you? Come here now. Hey, would you accompany me? I said, get inside. Just a minute. Come here, don't be scared. Come with me, this will be quick. - That's just like a bite of an ant. - See? After this, your future will be brighter. - Come here. - Go ahead now. - Dude! - Go ahead. You? Do you want to be bitten by an ant? - No, I was bitten long ago. - Then get lost. Alright, son. Take off your pants. - Let's go outside first. - Alright. Doctor Olivia Ex-Delos Santos. There's no chicken sandwich available. They only have hotdog. What do you want, regular or jumbo? Vienna Sausage. [WHISTLING] Coconut. Wow, dude, this looks good. What? Sir, we'd like two coconuts. [WHISTLING] Ouch! Alright, dude! - The umbrella has been opened. - [CHUCKLING] - Gilbert. - What happened to you? Nothing, mom, I got sprained while playing basketball. - Brother! - [GROANING] - What happened, brother? - Nothing. - Hello. - Oh, there's Adie. Adie, come. Adie is my son from my first marriage. He has a pad, just beside there. Adie. Adie, this is Ivy. - Hi. - Hello. Imagine, son, she was my sister in our sorority. And we were close in college. She'll be our new neighbor. Good. Believe me, dude. She doesn't look like she's the same age with mom. Really? Dude, she doesn't look like a mom. She resembles Brook Shields. I'm in love, dude. - I think you're just dreaming. - Right! That's a nightmare, dude! Hey! Dude, show it now, it's all healed up, right? Alright, but only to you. - How about them? - Nevermind them. Hey, guys, he doesn't want to show his dick to you. - Let's see. - That's unacceptable. - Slowly. - Dude, I paid for that. - Wait, this will swell. - Show it. - I paid for that, dude! - Dude, it's for our gang. We'll count, alright? One. Two. Three. [GROANING] This will definitely swell. Arnel! Arnel, will you hurry up? Bye, mom. Don't you want to be driven to school? No need, mom. I'll go with Adie. Why? We have three cars here. And Murphy is there. Why don't you let him drive you to school? Mom, I get bored riding in that car with that old driver. Besides, I think our car would be out of place in my new school. - I gotta go, mom, bye. - Arnel. Arnel! What about your milk? Finish it for me. [MUSIC PLAYING] Hey, watch it. Whoa.

You know why, because? I could see from all your faces that you are all morons! And I like turning stupid coconuts into eggheads. And do you know how I do it? - Like this! - [SMACKS TABLE] If you think you can take it easy with Mrs. Greogoria Tampepe. Think twice. Three times. Four times. Or even five. So, if you think you can take it easy with modern math. Think twice. This will remind you of me forever. Class. Class. This is my name. Miss-- don't forget the ''Miss''. M-I-S-S.

I'm just with my maids. My husband is assigned in Jedah. And we don't have any kids yet. - Is Virgie busy now? - Yeah. She's finishing a book. I wanted to ask her help to do the interior here. Too bad. Lucky! Tonight the Rice God, Nakumbatso... Mommy, I'm finished. Draw another one, a nipa hut... Okay? Here, copy this. Where's my eraser? How does life start? The fertile egg will go to the uterus. And the seed of the man will meet the egg of the lady. The hooking of the seed of the man and the egg of the woman. Dude. You know, I'm really bored with our sex education here. It's all theories. Sometimes, I want to try the real thing. If you want to try it, not with that. - I know a place. - Where? - In a sauna bath. - Hey! What? We'll go to the sauna bath. We'll go to the sauna bath. [WHISPERING] [MUSIC PLAYING] Come in! What?

If I know, he doesn't like these kinds of productions. It's not like that, Nemia. But you know, how it is. He is in Sinagapore right now attending to the business. Aunt, what's your next production? The next one will be a big fantasy musical. - Really now? - Why don't you let him join? Your talent might get wasted, if you don't use it. That's right, Arnel, why don't you? It's going to do you good. I know it runs in your blood. Your mother is very talented, son. - Not really. - Let him join. - Hello. - WOMAN: Who's this?

Can you get my glasses in the car? It's in the compartment. [MUSIC PLAYING] Okay, class. Are you ready with your coconut shells? STUDENTS: Yes, ma'am!

Nothing, let's just play. Happy Valentines. Okay. If that's what you like, let's just play. I'm not going to put these to waste. Oh, come on. Yes, it's true. Are you kidding me? Why don't you believe me? What? - Rose, are you telling the truth? - Why? Tonton. This is the happiest Valentine gift in my life! - Tonton, what are you doing? - Oh, God. Tonton? Hey! Tonton! What is happening to you? Tonton, come back here. Tonton, quick! Quick, reach for my hands. Tonton, quick... [SCREAMING] [CAR ARRIVING] Hi! - How is my beautiful girl? - I missed you! Give me a hug. That's nice. Did you miss me? How is everything? What I don't understand is... What's stopping you from courting her? How can I beat his looks? I don't know about you, Gilbert. But if I were you, I'd try. You have nothing to lose, man. At least if you got rejected, you tried, right? Alright, on our Junior Senior Prom. - I'll try. - Really? - What is that? - Cheating? - Ma'am, that's not mine. - Get out. Out! Who else? Who else? Surrender now, surrender! - Hello, Ivy! - Hi! Hi, Adie! - Long time no see. Come in. - Yeah. I had to study for our exams. It would be difficult if I flunk. So, let's go out this weekend? - This weekend? - Yup. - I'm not sure about Jojo. - [MUSIC PLAYING] Jojo, this is Adie. He's the son of my sister in our sorority. Adie, this is my husband, Jojo. Yeah, I remember. Hi, how are you? What's wrong with that guy? Adie, don't tell me you expected, a woman like her, to fall in love with you. Why not? She doesn't treat me like a kid. Her husband is here, that's why she can't do anything. You're just imagining it, but it's not what is happening. Why are you acting like you know better? Wow! You bastard! You'll ask for advice, then you'll get mad? That's not advice, you're underestimating me. - Hey, take it easy. - Enough. - What the heck! - You're unbelievable. You're fighting over a trivial thing. - Calm down! - Crap! - Do you have a date for prom? - Yeah. Janice said yes. You? - I can't say. - Why? There's a lot of things going on. You? That's my problem. I can't ask Cristine. I might get dumped. It's annoying, isn't it? It's such a hassle, there's so many problems. Hey, that'd be nice. Imagine me attending a senior's prom again? I'll feel sixteen once more. [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] - [KNOCKING ON DOOR] - Mom! Dad! Hey! Mom! Richard! Jupiter! Come on, guys! Rudolph. Hey! Why are you so loud? It's dawn already. Go home. All of your housemates are deaf, Janice. Once they sleep, they don't care anymore! So, what now? I don't know. - Alright, dude. - That's right, dude Let's just drink this night away. - Right. Let's just get drunk. - Toast, dude! One more drink and I'll be a bottle. What? One more drink and you'll be a bottle? Dude. [GILBERT SHUSHING ADIE] You're weak in drinking sessions. Me? I can still drink. I'll just go to the bathroom. Dude, I'm number one when it comes to drinking. Oh my! Just a minute, Janice. Ouch! What are we doing, Arnel? Why are we passing by here? We might get noticed if we pass in front. I'll jump, okay? I'll go first. You'll follow, alright? Take care. - Hurry. - [CHUCKLING] - Slowly. - Oh no! - Ouch. - Hang on. Quick. - My turn. - Okay. [JANICE SCREAMING] [ARNEL SHUSHING] You can do it, Janice. - Arnel, what are we doing? - Wait a minute. Slowly. Oh, my! Mom! Hi! Who is she? If you think you can force my son to marry you, you better think twice. After all, he's supposed to take-over the family business. The more reason he is not allowed to marry anyone. - Hey! - Hold on! Why is your mother talking about a wedding? I don't know. Please just stop, she'll scold me. - Please? - Eissenhower! There's a lot of you here, but no one's here. - Lucrecia! - Cleo! - Arnel, talk! - I really don't know. - Please, she'll get mad at me. - Everyone, wake up! Please. Arnel, you better start doing some explaining. Where did you pick up this girl? From the prom, right? - You picked her up from the prom. - Wait a minute. You wrench. You really want to treat me like trash? Then, let's get dirty. Madame, let me tell you this. Let me say, that it was you son's idea, not mine! You annoying prick! You'll invite me here then let your mom insult me! From time to time, you use what's hanging between your legs. Oh my god! Did you hear that manner of speech, Arnel? That's what I've been trying to tell you all this time. Those kind of girls. This is awful! And she's supposed to carry our name? I will never allow it. Do you understand me? Now get up. Arnel, get up! When I'm talking to you, you better be standing up. Now, say something. Not, "something". Understand? - Yes, or no? - Maybe. Wait. Excuse me. Where is the way out here? - Where is the way? - You're still here? There! - Thank you! - Janice, wait. - I can explain everything. - Arnel, stay where you are, - and don't move! - Janice! Arnel! Now, you listen to me, and you listen good. I want you to make me a promise, you understand? You are never going to see that girl again. - What is it, madame? - You're so late! I don't need you anymore. Go back to sleep. Yes, madame! Good night, madame. How'd it feel? Escorting a lady like me? Almost like a real man. Almost? Why? Is there something missing to make you feel like a real man? [MUSIC PLAYING] You're sweet. - Let's race. One time only. - One time? - Tonton, will you stop? - They're annoying. You're just scared. So, come on! Dude, your car can't win against mine. That model is old compared to mine. - What? Can your car compete? - What now? - Don't worry, I can handle this. - Alright! Tonton, stop. Please? Please, pull it over. Tonton! Enough. - Will you stop, Tonton? - You're nothing against us! Tonton! [GROANING] - Tonton Atienza. - Excuse me, do you know where-- - Arnel, over here. - Thank you. You knock. [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Dr. Samonte, please proceed to the I.C.U. - Good morning, ma'am. - Good morning. Can we talk to Tonton? I'm sorry, but he doesn't want to accomodate visitors. Can you tell him that it's us. Even you guys. [MUSIC PLAYING] Can you tell me what this rose means? - Hey! - That rose? Actually, that's the symbol of my love for you. And everyday... It gets bigger. And my feelings for you gets bigger also. - Really? - Yeah! - Rose? - Yes? - Rose. - What? - Nice to kiss the rose, right? - Yeah. You want? I kissed that already. I want another Rose. Close your eyes first. - My eyes? - Yeah. - Sure, I'll close my eyes. - Then open your mouth. - Open my mouth? - Yeah. - Gee, that's great. - Alright. Here you go. - Kiss? - Kiss? - Yeah, just one kiss. - You wish! You're unbelievable. Just one is fine. I don't want to. What a life. I really don't want to kiss you. I'm so unlucky. Just one kiss and I can't have it. So, are you contented now? Once is enough, just once. She kissed me! Wait, you left the other side! Hey, sweetheart. - Knock-knock. - Who's there? I am... (Ako maba) I am stinky? (Ako maba who?) - See you're smelly. - [CHUCKLES] So lame. - You're so lame. - [BOTH CHUCKLING] Aunt Nena! Aunt Nena! Yes? What? Who meddled with my things? Me. She did. I didn't have anything to do. Then I saw your room, and it's a mess. So, I fixed it. I saw your socks underneath the bed, and your books-- That was the way I wanted it. Now, it'll be difficult for me to look for my things. You moved my things away, it'll be hard for me to find them. Damn it! Forgive me, now if there's something you can't find, you can ask me. I'll find it for you. - Don't you have a shooting today? - None. Actually, I have an offer from Brocka. But I don't think I like it. You rejected it? You? - Rejected an offer? - Yeah. Why? Because I just thought... First. All I thought about was my movie career. Second. It's just my love life I'm interested in. So, how about you now? So, I decided to spend more time with you. Mom, if I were you, I'd accept the offer from Brocka. Maybe this is your chance to win an award. Isn't this the chance you've been waiting for? Don't you think it's about time to... You know, to make-up from my short comings? Mom. That was before. And we can't do about that anymore. So, stop treating me like a child. Because I'm not a child anymore. Mom. You know, I love you. And I know you love me too. We both know that. So, stop treating me like a baby, just to show me that you love me. You're leaving? Yes. Rocky called, we'll meet in Rome. He proposed to me. What did you say? Of course, I said yes. Come on. What about us? Why are you acting like we'll never see each other? We'll always be friends no matter what. Just like that? Why? Isn't that the most wonderful? We'll be the best of friends. Forever. Come on, Topee. I made you a man remember? So, act like a man. You're not a kid anymore. - Dad, let me help you. - I can do this. Just get some rest. You might get sick again. Dad, I'm all better now. Let me help you. - Are you sure you're alright now? - Yes, I can do this. - You're sure about this? - Yes. - I really can do this. - Slowly. Oh, my! Dad, It's heavy! This is heavy, dad. Gani! You really are stubborn! How many times do I say, don't let your son work! And what if he got sick? Are you the one going to pay for the bill? - You are stubborn! - Stop it! - Mom, will you stop? - Your dad is not listening to me! - Let me go! - I inisisted to help dad. Will you stop, mom? You know, mom, ever since I got into that accident, I realized, I disrespected dad too much. Because you always let me slip from my mistakes. And I know that you are both afraid to lose me. I know that and I also know that... I almost died when I was born. Right? So, there, I used that to disrespect dad. But mom, dad is a good man. He's just not complaining, because he doesn't have a job. Because you're the one who is feeding us. To all of us. But mom, I think, it's too much. I know your graduation is important. But... Five, six, seven. But what can I do? I'm having trouble selling these already! And I have to pay for your toga. Pray hard that I may be able to sell all these products. So, that we can pay for your toga. What is your mommy complaining about? You see... Actually, dad... Come on. Just speak up and tell me. Well, it's about this girl. - What about this girl? - I like her a lot. But the thing is, I'm scared. She's not rich. I don't think mom will approve. It's not that I want to marry her or anything. It's just that, I like her a lot. And I was really worried about mom, so I was wondering if you could help me out. Why are you here? I just wanted to talk to you. Have you known this for a long time? I've known it for a while. You know, dad. I don't understand why. Why can't you provide for your family? Why? Are you and mommy fighting? Don't you love us anymore? You know what, dad? They've taught us in school. The father should be the one supporting his family. Aren't you our father? If what they are teaching in school is wrong, then I don't want to study anymore. Is that right? Speak up. - Yes. - Right? Am I right? Yes, you're correct. You are really correct. Wait a minute. I'm your father and you're just my son. - Why are you lecturing me? - Just kidding, dad. It's just that, we don't have money. - You want a massage? - You bastard. Mom. [SOBBING] Mom. - Mom, can I talk to you? - Later, Adie. - Just for a minute. - I have to finish this article. So, I can have an emotional catharsis. God. I can't take this. I can't detach my self from this issue. Something should be done about these refugees. Just the look in the eyes of the child. It pierces my heart. Oh, God. Bye. - Come home early, okay? - Bye. Sweetheart, can you bring home... - What do you want? - Peach walnut cake. - Peach walnut cake. - One whole. ♪ I'll wait for you ♪ Just one of your debts. And I'm the one to shoulder it. No. This is for you. - Really? - Yeah, this is for you. - Aren't you out of your mind? - No. Thank you. - We both have. - Hey, give me more. Give me more, I need to buy new clothes. And I'll have our bedroom renovated. - You'll have our house fixed? - Yes. Why? Don't you want our bedroom to look nice? I would like to start that mushroom plantation. [PARENTS CHATTERING] [PARENTS CHATTERING] - Please. - As if you don't like it. Hey, have some biscuits. [PEOPLE CHATTERING] You're annoying, I don't like it. Get real. Dude, think of it. Just two-- - What? - Hey! Dude, think of this, in the next two days... We'll gradute. Yeah! In the next school year, we'll be in college. Dude, have you thought what you're going to take up? Me? No! Maybe education. Education? There's no money there, right? - Maybe Mass Communications. - Mass Communications? There's also no money there, but it's alright. - You? - Me? I'll pursue my martial arts. You, Tonton? Me! Me! After graduation, I'll take a job. The one that will help everybody. Morning until night, just helping. Metro Aide. [CHUCKLING] Dude... I'll put up a disco. All the music will be Michael Jackson. Billy Jean. - Beat it! - [CHUCKLING] You? Tonton? You know, that guy. Doesn't plan about his life. That's right. You've been gone for a while. What happened to you? We thought you're mad at us. To you guys? No. - To myself? Yes. - Why? Why? Because of the things that happened to me. What happened to Rose. All that happened becasuse... I didn't care about myself. I wasn't thinking of what I'm doing. Dude, I think you're stoned. You look very serious. And why not? I should take what happened to Rose seriously. Some things happen in our lives... that we should take seriously. Like what will happen two days from now. We'll all graduate. But do we know what is the meaning of graduation? Yes, we know from high school, we're college now. That's all. But that's not it, dude. The meaning of graduation, is change. Changing ourselves. But I think, from what we're doing. We're too far from that. Dude. Have mercy on yourselves. Don't be like me. I'm not acting my age. Use your heads. Not the one down there, but the one up there. This is important. Dude, light it up. Do you have a match? Son of a-- What's wrong with you? - [GROANING] - [THUDDING] - Dude! Carry him! - Carry him! Dude, hurry up. - Lay him down. - Alright, put his head here. Slowly. Give me that! Dude. When graduation is coming, drama is filling one's life. Right? [METAL GATE CLANKING] - Excuse me, sir. - Yes? I just wanted to apologize about my behaviour, during the first time I met you. It's alright, I understand, little boy. Little boy? Young man. - Sir. - [MUSIC PLAYING] What is she doing here? Arnel, you promised me you won't see her again. Mom, I love her. Arnel, you're being disobedient now. Didn't you hear me? I said, I love her. - So? - So, stop treating her that way. Ditas. Can we talk for a while? Excuse us. Your son and I, had a long, nice chat. And for the first time... I began to understand things I never understood before. Ditas... Our son is not a kid anymore. Let him decide on his own. He's not going to get married anyway. - I had a long talk with my dad. - [PARENTS CHATTERING] I can do this. I'm courageous. Melissa, I love you. Gilbert? - Gilbert? - Hi! What are you doing here? Aren't you attending the graduation? I will. I will. - Then? - I have something to tell you. What's that? It's just... Nothing. I forgot. Sorry.

How did you know that I like you? It's really obvious from the way you look. Don't get too close, I'm feeling weak. I may not be able to graduate. - That's alright. - Wait. How about the other guy? Mon, our classmate? I thought you two are dating? - Mon? - Yeah. He's my cousin, didn't you know that? Then why did Ronnie tell me that he's your boyfriend? Ronnie? He's a friend of Ronnie.
