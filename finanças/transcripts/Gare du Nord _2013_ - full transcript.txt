Hi, I'm doing a survey for the Paris Transport Authority. Hello, how are you? I have about ten questions to ask for a survey. Hello, Madam. I'm doing a survey for the PTA, I could ask you on the escalator... No, not today. - Do you have a Navigo pass? - No. Oh, yes. Do you feel safe using the service? Yes, fairly. Would you know what to do if you were attacked? Yes, I would press the nearest alarm button. The alarm? - Right? - Yes, that's good. Just a few more questions. Do you work in Paris? - No. - Outside Paris? No, I don't work. OK. Are you retired? It's just for the questionnaire. I'm not working right now. Goodbye. You want me to get fired? Yeah, right. - Hello. - Hello. How are you? You came in yesterday. - The day before actually. - Yes, of course. I'm OK, but... as I told you, I'm having all this tiring treatment. Yes, I remember. Actually, I wanted to try on... There was a choker I liked... Yes. The dog collar. Here it is. - Is that what you call it? - Yes. - You want to try it? - Yes. It's very pretty. It catches a bit on my... It doesn't make any difference. I'm ugly. He's right. No, you're very beautiful. I'm pleased I found you again. I need your name and address or my questionnaire is worthless. Please. Mathilde Delauney. 38 Avenue Henri Barbusse... "Y". With an "A" and a "Y"? Avenue Barbusse, in Noisy le Sec. Telephone number? - Profession? - I teach History. - In a school? - At the university. - Oh, really? Which university? - Paris One. I'm doing sociology, at Paris Eight. - I'm doing my thesis here. - Here in the Gare du Nord? - A PhD thesis? - Yes, I do surveys to finance it. Can't you get a grant? I don't have connections. - It isn't about connections. - Isn't it? They must have changed it. Well... What's your thesis about? The station? The SNCF? No, it's not the SNCF. It's... When you're here, you're nowhere really, but at the same time, it's like a village square. And if this was a village, it would be the world. Look at Tan, he works mornings here in his uncle's shop, in the afternoons he sells Vietnamese artists' work online. He has degrees in political science and world economics. He's Iranian. I'd like to interview him, but Persians don't trust Arabs. I've heard crazy stories about him. - I bet he would talk to you. - Why? - I'm sure. - Anyway, I'm shy. You're too beautiful to be shy. - I can't go talk to him. - Yes, you can. No... People say he kidnaps missing girls from the station. OK, I have to be going now. When will you be coming again? This evening, but I'll be tired. What time? At five o'clock. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. See you at five? Where do you think you're going? Look at me! Excuse me, sir. Let go of her. Sir... - Calm down, please. sir. - Stay out of this. - It's personal. - Not when you pull her arm. Miss, do you wish to make a complaint? Are you sure? Don't be afraid. Off you go. - Fuck! - Calm down. - OK, OK. - Take it easy. - Take it easy. - Calm down, sir. I'm jealous too. It does drive you crazy. Ismael. Mathilde has come back. No, I was thinking. You need to ask for a grant for your thesis... OK, you tell me what I need. You should ask for a grant or a bursary. You thought of me? What does your tutor say? My tutor and I don't even agree on the title. He wants to call it: "Local Mobility, Global Immigration: new transport practices and representation at Gare du Nord." - It sounds crap. - What's your title? "Gare du Nord: Global Village Square". Not academic enough, is it? Not really, but it's nice. You think so? My tutor thinks I'm a waster. He doesn't believe in my thesis. I believe in it. But now I have to go. Because I need to... I need to save my energy a bit at the moment. Are you coming back tomorrow? No, I'll be coming back Wednesday afternoon. That's a long time. Do you have a mobile phone? I'll give you my number. You can call me and we'll keep in touch. - I'll write it for you. - No. Yes... If you want. Would you mind answering some questions for the PTA? Hello, madam. Will you answer a questionnaire? Hi. Would you mind answering a questionnaire for the PTA? We can do it on the escalator. Do you come here every day? OK. Do you have a Navigo Pass? - Hello. - Hello. You OK? Come on, I'll introduce you. What are you doing here? Keep walking. - Stop it! - Keep walking. - Leave me alone. - Don't hang around here. How's it going, guys? You all right? - Is that your girlfriend? - No, she's my sister. I don't want her hanging here. Women shouldn't hang out here. Why? Women are mostly rubbish. They should stop messing around and all that, they should work, get married and have kids. Are you going to marry your woman? My woman? I don't know. She keeps her eye on me. But if she doesn't catch me... What if she had another guy? - What? - If she had another guy? Impossible. It's all right for guys to mess around, but if girls do it, we kill them. OK. It's a deal. No, I don't like it. I've never been in here. It could be interesting. - Thank you, ma'am. Goodbye. - Bye. These are the darkest we stock. Haven't you got anything like this for black skin? The last time I asked, the lady said she had another. This is too light for my skin. Sales isn't my really area. Did you get some training? No, I'm still young, I'm 20. I got this job, but I haven't progressed. I'm more interested in working as a childcare assistant. I see. My three month trial period ends today. But they haven't told me yet if I can continue... Why don't you ask them? No, if I step out of line, it's over for me. That's what she said. You write it down? Yeah, but it's not really allowed. Because it's supposed to be recorded? Nobody is going to check up. She said all the businesses are closing down where she comes from, there's unemployment everywhere. She thought she'd stay there like her parents and grandparents, but all the industry and companies in the region closed down. She didn't expect it to be this tough. There. That's what's she said. My parents didn't expect it to be this tough either. Are you OK? You have to go? Is that it? It's tough now, but it'll be better once you're cured. Yes. Of course. - I’ll be back late tonight. - OK. Prison is a waste of time and money. Especially when you have a kid. You do one, two, three, four years, you don't know if your kid will still recognise you. That's not good, man. You get out and people have moved on, they're doing this and that. Do you think it's political? Kids doing time at 16 in the Gare du Nord, and then prison, wasting time and all that. - Do you think that is political? - Sure. Everybody can see that. Even the police can see that. It's true, life is tough. But you shouldn't blame kids for the things they do. They do those things to survive. We used to think: "What do I care?" And some people have accepted this life, they make easy money doing this or that, and it's become normal to them. But other kids only do it to survive. They have plans. Job interviews, for example. If they don't get the job, it does their head in. But the other guys have girls and money, and so they're watching TV and thinking: "I can be like them too." TV influences them. Television is the world. Everyone thinks that TV is the world. I think TV controls the world. Mother, now it's time to go pray for my health, Mathilde has come back... My friends... And you, my hands, don't tremble anymore And you, my arms, don't reach out Mathilde... Thank you. - He's sad. - He's not normally like this. I've brought you a Dictaphone. We'll need to buy some batteries. To finish the PTA survey, I got behind with my work. But your thesis is more important. I might end up like him waiting tables in here. No. He thinks the Gare du Nord is at the center of the world. It isn't the center of the world, it's the souk. And you'll never get him out of the souk. Stop it. You see everything as black. No, I see everything as an Arab. Now, madam, you'll have to clean up those marks. What? I didn't leave those marks. - I’m not your slave, madam. - I paid fifty cents. I thought it was you, I saw you in the metro. Do you remember me? I did a Master's in History. Yes, I think so. Where are you teaching now? No, I don't teach. I'm actually an estate agent. Real Estate. Eight years of college... Excuse me. My boss is on the Eurostar. I have to hurry. It was nice to see you. Let me give you my card. They don't have any batteries. Hey, you see that girl in pink over there? She's a former student of mine. I met her in the toilets. She did eight years at college and now she's an estate agent. You see? And she's not an Arab. Her guy is on the dole. I don't see the connection? I do. Have you interviewed that man selling sweets? - You come from China? - Nepal. - Where? - Nepal. - From Nepal? - Yes. Are you Buddhist? Muslim? You don't believe in God? I believe in work. Sir. That's 7 euros, 10 cents, please. 7 euros, 10 cents? I'll leave it, thanks. L got my papers in Japan. But not to come to France. That was just luck. I was in the army. You came straight from Japan to France? - Directly? - Yes. Because I got in trouble over there. You were in the Foreign Legion? I went to Calvi in Corsica, because I screwed up. Three years. For three years? - Hello, how are you? - Hello, Colonel. - Wow! You're a colonel? - Lieutenant colonel. He was a parachutist in the 2nd Regiment in Calvi. One euro 50. Thanks. - Thanks. Bye. - Bye. I have to go now too. Goodbye. I'm leaving now. I'll be back tomorrow at... At ten. Will you be here? - I don't know yet. - Oh, come on. Let's say ten o'clock by the sports shop. - Foot Locker? - Yes. OK? OK, see you tomorrow. Bye. - I miss my country. - You miss it? I work here, but I don't feel at home. Are you married to a French woman or a Nepali? Nepali. My wife wants my daughters to grow up here. But I don't see our future here. It's dangerous here. Do they speak Nepali? We speak to them in Nepali at home. It's important to have some roots. Of course. But I don't think the schools in Bobigny are better. - They go to school in Bobigny? - I live in Bobigny. Damn it. Give me the tickets. - Mum, you said. - Yeah, you promised. It's this one. Yes, it's here. I know, my darlings. I know. - I have to stay in Paris. - You promised. See what this does to them? When I come back, I'll make Gratin Dauphinois. - Come with us. - I'll be back tomorrow. - Come home with us. - I can't. - We never see you. - Hurry up. See you soon, sweetheart. Go inside, please. The doors are closing. Step back, madam. It's dangerous. - Can't I get on? It isn't moving. - Step back, please. - I have to get on with them. - Stand back, madam. Stand back. Hello? Yes, Madame Mercier. Fourth floor. No, there's no lift. I told you. OK, I'm on my way. Mathilde! You know those African braids? They sell like hot cakes. I can sell 100 for 100 euros. Normally they cost 300 euros. - You mean hair braids? - Yeah, exactly. - Do you want a drink? - Yes, please. I'd like a tea. Can I have a tea, please? You're going to break everything, it's the same every day. Wow, they're nice. They're expensive. What brand are they? They're called One Star. They cost 90 euros. You're a flashy dresser. No, I'm not. The only things I buy are jeans. I only buy Diesel. I buy them for 150 - 200 euros. I've spent a lot of money on jeans. But when I don't have any money, I have new suits at home. I have 1,300 euro suits, which I buy for 150, 200 euros. I can sell them for 400. You should save money so you can buy a house in Algeria. No, if I ever buy a house, I'll buy in France. You're Algerian, you should go home. - I'm not an Algerian. - You are. - You should buy a house there. - I was born here, I'm French. - It's better over there than here. - No, it's better here. I was brought up in the forest. I go back every year. I went a few times when I was a kid. I might go back one day to visit. When I reach forty, I'm moving back home. There's a time for everything, you have to make room for others. You see that man over there? Yeah. He came to me because he knows Venezuelans, people who bring in powder. 36,000 euros a kilo. I’m not interested. I prefer selling braids. I use to deal when I was a little thief. Before I had kids. But now... - Now you're clean. - Yeah. I don't have much time, I need to go now. OK. Will you wait while I take her? Goodbye. I'm pleased to have met you. Are you bored? Come down to RER Line 1 with me, I want to show you something. Are you seeing her? Are you crazy? She's my tutor. So I'll see you tomorrow? Arnaud? I have to go now. Can I see you again tomorrow? We don't have to go, if you don't want. No, it's just... I have ten minutes. Whatever you want. Is it Arnaud's parallel economy that interests you? He's a street vendor, but he thinks like a French shopkeeper. I love that. This is the RER Line 1 bedroom. Kids come here to make love. - They make love? - Yes. They say: "We fucked here!" "Easy guy with easy girl." You find that beautiful? Yeah, I do. "Easy guy with easy girl." We love each other but it doesn't count. But we love each other. - I’m off. - When are you coming back? - Tomorrow. - At two o'clock? Yes, at the Congolese place. At the Alyzé? Think of me. You too. Mr Saint Louis said it could be interesting for me to talk to you. - Are you at the University? - Yes, I’m a student. - I see. - And an activist. You see that? People hide in there. You see the hole at the back? - They hide in there? - Yes. - To cross the channel? - Yeah. They find a little ledge to stand on and hold on to. How do they manage it? They find a place to hold on. - And they manage to hold on? - Yes, they do. They support themselves on those two points. - And do they make it there alive? - Some. Some others came really early in the morning and climbed up there to take the Eurostar to England. Because the Eurostar is closed. But why early in the morning? Because the police don't get here until 6:30 or 7. Yes, that's why they put up these fences here. Those wires will electrocute you from a distance of 50 cm. - Without touching them? - Without touching the wires. They're so powerful, at less than 50 cm, you get electrocuted. OK. Another guy climbed on that bridge over there. - You see it? - Yeah. One guy got on that and jumped onto the roof of the train. He got cut in half. He died. Yes, he was one meter tall when we found him. Yes, I'm on my way now. I'll be there in one minute. I'd like to check my notes with your version. - Can I have your phone number? - OK. Your thesis is on the Gare du Nord? - Yes. - That's a cool idea. - What's your name? - Vincent. - Mine's Ismael. - OK, Ismael. - Hey, how's it going? - All right? Guess what we caught on the CCTV. You won't believe your eyes. A love scene with our student friend here. I’m sure it was him. - Hello. What's so funny? - We saw you. - What? - On our screens. The RER 1 bedroom is normally for kids. We saw you with that old lady. So everyone was watching me on the screens? And do you wank each other off too? Hey, take it easy! Whores and their johns are outside, not in the station. You're not even worth the ground she walks on! - She's a queen! - Enough! - You're a shit! - Enough! Go have your break. "L can't come. Sorry. Ismael." My daughter has run away. She's 17 years old. Do a lot of young girls come here? Yes, 18, 19 even 20 years old. And have there been any incidents recently with young girls? Yes, not long ago there was a young girl in here, she wanted to use the toilets but she wouldn't pay. I told her to pay but she didn't have any money. - She was a rough sleeper. - A what? A girl who sleeps rough, she was homeless. - Do you understand? - Yes. She was on the streets. And she didn't want to pay. - How was she dressed? - She was dressed normally. When was this? Not long ago. About two weeks ago. You've had no trouble since then? Yes, there were other times. There are Romanians who come and give me trouble. And is it often French girls? Yes, it's everybody. Foreigners, everybody. Hello? No, still nothing. I'm making some progress but not much. No, I'm staying here. Stop telling me what I should be doing. If the cops find her first, that will be even better. Yes. - Go and polish your sausage! - Yeah, polish it! Yeah, Ceausescu! Ceausescu! You're impotent! You can't come! I can't come? I'll get the police not the polish! This is crazy! This is my daughter. - Have you seen her? - No. What's your name? Can you give me your phone number? - Why? - Because he just insulted me. I'm in a dispute with him. You were a witness. Stop showing off. - They're filming "Hidden Camera". - Yeah, up there. Do you recognise him? He does "Hidden Camera". Hey. stop that! - Are you OK? - I'm OK. That guy is mental. - Do you have a key for the door? - Yes. The keys... Here they are. Help! He's crazy! He's crazy! Call the police! Stop that! Get out of here! Get out! Go away! - Get off me! - Let go of her! - Get out! - Call the police! Hurry LIP! Hello, Nadia? What's the number for the police? I can't find it. There's a special number. Where are the cops? Go on, get out! Stay with me! He'll be back. Ismael, if you're in the station, please help me! There's been a fight in the lingerie shop. I can't find it! Dial 17. No, there's special number for the station. - No. - Water. I don't have water! This isn't a café. - Water. - Go away! Ismael, we're in trouble here. Come and help me, please. Ismael... You were very brave. - Were you here from the beginning? - Yes, but I can't stay. I'll just take your details. Come inside, sir. Can I go? I saw what happened. I can tell you. - You saw it? - Yes. I really have to go. - I saw it. - Is it a joke? - No. - You do "Hidden Camera". No, I was just passing when I saw him, he went that way. - Just over there? - Yeah. Let's go. Come on, guys. He's back! Yes, open the door, if you want to slit my throat. Don't hurt her. Cuff him! This is great, Beckham! Lacy knickers, G-strings... Water! Water! Girlfriend away? Are they for Victoria? - I want a glass of water! - Sit down, sir. Come in, please. - Water! - We'll bring you some water. What's the name of the shop? - Intimes. - Pardon? - Intimes. - OK. Can I take your statement? I came here twice last week. We'll take your statement now. Do you remember? "Mauchon." "Sacha Mauchon." That's where I recognise you from, you do that show on the TV. - Can I get a photo with you? - My daughter has run away. We haven't heard from her for eight days. - How old is she? - Seventeen and a half. - Almost an adult. - So? What are you doing about it? Do you have any leads? What are you actually doing? Everyone says young girls disappear in the station. You can see what it's like in here. But that doesn't help me. We've passed it on to all police stations. But where is she on here? Where's her picture? Where is it? Have you found all those others? We'll do all we can to find your daughter. Is that her? Can I put one of mine up too? I see there's a space. Give it here. Shall we take your statement now? And then can I get a photo with you? Yeah. My boss came. He was angry. He said I have to be careful. I can't do everything at the same time. And they still haven't repaired the machines. - What machines? - The theft alarm. It doesn't work, so the boss says I have to watch carefully. He puts me under pressure. Look. This is my daughter. She's disappeared. Do you recognise her? She's a bit younger than you. You must have heard the stories about girls who disappear here, girls who have gone missing. Right? I prefer not to talk about it, because I'll get scared. Would it be possible to get a photo? Thanks. Thanks very much. Ismael, if you're in the station, please help me! There's been a fight in the lingerie shop. Ismael, we're in trouble here. Come and help me, please. Ismael. Mathilde! I read it, it's good. It's well written, it's powerful. And stylish, which is rare for a collective effort. I want to fight to win, not just to look cool in meetings. Yeah, but I'm not sure about winning. We gave a lot at the République/ Nation demo. We need a new kind of struggle now. Look. Train drivers and signalmen come in there. OK. That building with the corrugated iron roof is the signals building. And just below here, that's the command post. I see you've got to know a lot of people. Yeah, gradually. You have to gain their trust. Is it the CGT, Sud or Sudrail? My subject is the station. It's not the SNCF. - Is that your daughter? - Yeah. I see so many people here. - With a dog? - No. They always have dogs. I don't like it. She hasn't got a dog. I have a ticket for the 8:58, will it be OK? That's 10 Euros. - Hello. - Hi, I don't have a ticket, but I have to take this train. Not without a ticket. - I'm prepared to pay a fine. - I can't give you a fine. - When does it leave? - Which train? The client can't come tomorrow at eleven. I can't help you if you don't tell me. Thank you. See you tomorrow. Excuse me? Do you recognise her? - Is she your daughter? - Yes. I’m sorry. I wish I could help. Shut up! Hello, this is Mathilde. I’m on my way to the station, I don't know if you're there or not. In any case, I put batteries in the Dictaphone. He's not playing well. He's no good. - Then take another. - Yeah, take another. It's not difficult. He's too old. He's had his day, it's over. - There's almost nobody left. - What did you expect? - There aren't even any kids. - Is he a striker? It's too late, the die is cast. OK, see you tomorrow. Bye. See you tomorrow. A man just disappeared there. Disappeared? Really? - Didn't you see him? - No. Now you're seeing people disappear. I’m a ghost. That's why he hasn't come. That's why he hasn't come. - Come on, let's go. - OK. He used to hang here, he wants to talk about gangs. He won't wait for us. - Seriously, hurry it up. - I'm coming. What's his name? He's called Manu. He's by the Foot Locker. I must be crazy. I've fallen in love like a 15 year-old. Wait, let me tell you what happened. There was this weird guy who was drunk. He said: "Yeah, I've raped girls before." And then he started coming towards me. I said: "Get away from me!" I was so scared, and you weren't answering. Are you OK now? Excuse me, you're making me want to smoke. - You want one? - Thanks a lot. I couldn't help overhearing. That sounds terrible. - Yeah. - Where was it? Here. - In the station? - Yeah, Gare du Nord. - When? - Just now. And the cops? I went to them. They don't give a shit. - I don't like this station. - Me neither. - All the guys here are animals. - Yeah. Not all guys. - Most of them. - Around here anyway. I met a guy in Chatelet. - You did? - Yeah. He kept looking at me, so I said: "What's up?" He said: "You're beautiful." He asked my name. I said: 'Tamara" and we talked. I was in a hurry, so he asked for my number. I said: "Give me yours and we'll see." So I sent him a message, he called me back and we talked, then he called me every night. And then you went out with him. Yes, but I was only 17. He was 22. And he had a daughter and I didn't know. He wanted me to sleep with him. I wasn't ready but he wanted to do it, so I decided to call it all off. Are you in love with him? Yes. I mean, I don't know. I don't know if I'll take the train. I'm waiting for my sister, she's always late. Where are you going? Nowhere. I love traveling and filming animals. I'm looking for my daughter. She's the same age as you. Did she run away? Did she leave because you're nasty to her? We argued. And you? Do you always come here? Often, yes. Do you think you'll find her here? Don't forget about your daughter's character. With a girl, when you've seen something, you can believe it. When you've seen what? I've seen stuff. Things. Yeah, what things? I don't know you well enough to tell you, but if you want, we can try some things for your daughter. What things? Try to see her and feel her. You might be able to sense where she is. - Will you watch my bag? - Yeah. 5, 6. 7. 3. 9,10,11,12,13,14, 15,16,17,18,19,20. Well? She's with a dog. She hasn't got a dog. We never know what is around us. I won't tell you more because I'm scared. That's my sister calling me. - I work at the police station. - Really? Yes, there are lots of suicides here. There was one last week. - In the station? - No, in the Metro. I always try to put myself in the person's shoes, to understand why they did it, how they got to that point. Because they think about everything. They choose their station. There's a bend on the track down there, so the driver doesn't see them. The guy jumps. And gets all cut to pieces. It's just like somebody getting on a motorway bridge and jumping off. Except it's in the Metro. But you don't even see the sky before you die. I don't know what it's like to die, but I imagine the head... A quarter of second is a long time when a head comes off a body. Fifty cents, please, sir. I don't have 50 cents. You need to pay to come in. Yes, I understand, you need the money to make a living... No, it's not that. I’ll still be paid at the end of the month. Listen, madam. I have shares, I lend money to the state... Good for you, sir. I work in the toilets and that's enough for me. Thank you, sir. I went to school. You have to let it show a bit. People here want to bring you down. I told the manager once. When I'm here, my brain works at 30 percent. So when people bring me down, we've even. Because when I'm at 100 percent, I give out slaps. So it's better for me to be at 30 and for people to think I'm stupid. It went up a bit just now. I've just had a break, so it's gone up a bit. - Me too. - Really? Yes, because you're quick at repartee. The Gare du Nord is a very dangerous place. There are evil ghosts. What? Dead people in the crowds. Dead people? There are good ones, of course, but there are also evil ones. So you have to be very careful. People say they wear clogs on their feet. But here in Europe, with shoes, you can't hear them. "Sorry. I had no credit. I think about you all the time. Ismael." It says platform seven. It's here. I think that's her. Hello, madam. Police. Stop there, please. - What for? - You know very well what for. Where have you been? - Belgium. - You were in Belgium? OK. Let's go. They only realise at the end that they loved each other. Yes, it's a shame, sometimes we don't see things. It's like "Je l'aimais" by Gavalda. - Who? - Anna Gavalda. It's similar. - Yes, it's the same. - He misses his opportunity. Hello. Are you getting this one too? No. - Are you going to London? - Yes. You see that man over there. - There. - Yes. He forgot this, could you give it to him? It's too late, now. It's his Dictaphone, he's a sociologist. OK. I'll give it to him. I'll write a note for you to give to him. I used to have an apartment at the Carrefour de l'Odéon. I still go there. There's a butcher's shop on the Rue du Faubourg St Honoré. The "Boucherie Nivernaise". Do you know it? You must know it! It's close to St Philippe du Roule, just past the British Embassy. I'd never buy my meat on Rue du Faubourg St Honoré. I do, when I'm in Paris. It's good meat. - This is his number. - OK. - You'll give it to him? - Yes. I can't get through there now. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. It's great what we do. You're great. People see your face and laugh, it makes them feel good. It's important. But some days I don't feel like doing it. I don't want to do it. No. But you looked after your daughter. She's 17 and a half now. She's not a baby anymore. - Come on. - She lived with me, yes, but maybe I didn't listen to her. Do you know why she left? No, I don't know. She must have not felt at home. This is perfect, it's full of pigeons. Come on, cheer up. We'll have some fun. Look! That woman there. Goon Excuse me, madam. It's a survey for the SNCF. - How many assholes do you have? - What? You're sick! - Don't be embarrassed. - You're sick! You wanker! See? I’m not on form. - Yeah, you're not on form. - I told you. Let's go eat. - I’m pathetic. It's not funny. - No, you're not pathetic. I'll buy you dinner. It will do us good. Come on. I don't want to work. I'm staying here until I find her. Look, there's that guy. Look, this is my daughter. I'm American, I don't speak French. What? It's crazy. Do you feel inspired here? We could film in the station. It's good here. We have to die to together. OK. Let's go. I don't want to go to the Gare du Nord. Let's get off at St Lazare. No. Please. No. Come on. There's a boy who wants to make love with you, to have a threesome with me, no problem, just make love, OK? Are you sure? No, it's not OK. OK, if it's not OK... Right, I'll get going now, otherwise they will... OK, boss. What time on Monday? Monday? When will you be here? - What time will you be here? - Midday. I’ll come between midday and one o'clock. - What's your name? - Mario. OK, boss, see you Monday. Bye. Hi. How's it going? - Hi, how are you? - Good. We're almost ready. What will your name be? I have to change my name? Yes, for security reasons. We don't care about names. And does it have to be a French name? No, anything you like. From now on, call me Pierre. Pierre? Yes, on the phone, by email, in the street. I'll have a rent boy name: Mario. OK, Mario, if you get arrested... I'm not going to get arrested. You know they might arrest people. No, I can't get arrested here. Listen, the tactic is to keep the police talking as long as possible so the media have time to arrive and film us as we get arrested. No, I can't get arrested, Vincent. I can't let that happen. Not here in the station. If I get arrested here, it's over. Hello? Can you put the kids on? OK, listen, I'm going to be back a bit late. I don't know, an hour maybe. No, there are trains every hour. Gaspar... Oh, shit. Gaspar! Gaspar! Talk to Gaspar. Hello, Gaspar... "As you can see, I'm waiting. 1. for you to call me back, 2. for my client, who is late. I love you." Even if you do shout at me all the time. Do you have any change? No, I don't. Safe journey, madam. Good luck, madam. Thank you. I'll take it to the office. Let go, please. He's sweet. He's not my dog. He's adopted me. He follows me. He recognizes you from another life. Yeah, maybe. Sorry about your Dictaphone. I left it in Lille. I never found your sociologist friend on the Eurostar. I saw him over there just now. I couldn't speak to him because he was leaving. I'm stuck here waiting for a client. I'm waiting for my husband, we're meeting here at seven o'clock. You have lots of time. Yes, I have too much time. I’ll stroll around Paris, to make the most of it. Why's that? I'm having an operation tomorrow. My husband insisted on taking my suitcase and taking me to the clinic. I've been going alone for months, but now he suddenly cares. It was the same when I was pregnant. He's taking my suitcase to work with him, and now people will ask him questions. And that bugs me... I could have left here in a locker. That's husbands for you. And time as well. The same answers to the same questions. Loving someone you think is a fool. It's awful. Yes, but what is loving someone? - Hello. - Nice to meet you. - Hello. - Hello. - OK, shall we go? - Yes. ...at 13253. It's my last day. I'll be at the station around 4 o'clock. The operation is tomorrow. OK, bye. And, obviously, I have to carry the bribe. Eighty thousand euros. Can you believe it? Do you eat chocolate? So that's why you're so friendly. Yes, we're by the departures board. Where are you? I have a train at 13:19. Yes, I'm leaving straightaway. Mummy will be here in a minute. - I want to show you something. - Don't I get a kiss? Let go. Mummy! Let me carry you. "Stuck in traffic jam on motorway." Another half an hour! I'm not going to make it. Is it your dog'? Yes. It's funny, I've never really liked dogs. They don't interest me. Do you like working in security? I do this job so I can be with my dog. I never leave him. He's very jealous. I need to ask you a favour. Look at this. It's a photo of my daughter. She disappeared here. You must've seen her. Do you remember? No, I don't know. - What? - No. No what? You've seen her? When was it? - Yesterday. - Yesterday? Here? - Yeah. - I was here yesterday. I’m not sure. I remember the dog she had. But I don't remember her face. And did you talk to her? No, I don't talk. But the dog was a mongrel. - Very calm. - A mongrel. - What color? - Black. I have to go now. Come on, Fred. Can I give you this number, in case you see her. - Thanks. - You're welcome. But we do spend time together. I'm happy spending time with you. You have a child, you're married. You have a perfect life. I don't have a perfect life. You can't say someone has a perfect life just like that. I don't have a more perfect life than you. Plus a weekend away with you, and my work, which I love... Don't you love me more than your work? You said you needed to go away for a weekend. You needed to some air and sun. But look at you now. - We only had one whole day. - No, we had three days. No, we've had one full day in more than three months. You know it's not easy for me. So stop complaining about it. It's boring. - We should go soon. - Already? - Don't leave me. I feel useless. - Stop it. It's easy to put yourself down. Let's go. Leave three euros. You won't make it. What? You won't make your train. Yes, I will, it's Brussels. The second train on the list. Look: "16255", and it's 16210. I just bought it, they said I have half an hour. Yes, but by the time you get to the train... And 2nd class is at the far end of the platform. There will be a queue, someone might be in your seat... It's not looking good for you. Take the next one. You won't catch that one. I'm telling you, you won't make it. Do you work here? No, but I've taken that train. You won't make it. I'll try anyway because I don't think I can get a refund. You won't have time to get over there. Second class is at the far end. I'll try anyway because I won't get a refund. - What? - I won't get a refund now. No. It's 125 euros down the drain. OK, thanks. Straight down the drain. Thank you, sir. "Tu me fais réver!" "Tu me fais réver!" "Oh, jolie poupée, tu me fais réver" You're Bernard Menez. Right? Is this why you've been horrible to me? Is it the babysitter? And the children? What about the children? Do we hand them over like dirty laundry at the station? I hope you die. - Which phone company are you with? - Leave me alone. I work for a phone company and we've created a new tariff called "the good news tariff", and all negative conversations are free, which means if you get dumped or lose your job or a loved one, or you get stood up by a friend, you don't pay for anything negative. Do you think I'm not funny? Still looking for your daughter? SHOP CLOSED... FOREVER. AGATHA You're here already? Yes, I'm early. I'm trying to kill time. Even the night before my operation, he still has to work! And you're still here. Where is your client? My client? I don't know. He's not here yet. And do you think he's going to come? What's the matter? This job kills me. I just want to be with my children. I’m sorry. Start filming. They'll come out there and there. Look, I'll show you. Can you see the exit there? They'll come out of there too. Hands off the Health Service! We're not for sale! Hands off the Health Service! We're not for sale! Hands off the Health Service! We're not for sale! A train is about to enter the station on track 34. Please get back on the platform and off track 34. Get back on the platform. Service interrupted in both directions. Please await further announcements. Unbelievable. What a mess! I'll send it, for him to know it's true. You attention please, due to the presence of people on the tracks, all traffic at this station has been suspended. We will issue more information as soon as possible. It's a transformer or something which has blown. A transformer changes the current. It has to change 320 volts to 220 volts, that's not easy! Yes, when it works, it's fine... ls it terrorists? Shit, it's nurses and doctors. No, it's nurses. And when are we leaving? Nobody knows. THIS BOOK BELONGS TO: VA... This is unbelievable. Hello, François? Damn it. Hello? Yes! Hello? Hello, François? There's no signal. Shit! You can't stay there, madam. Slop! Your attention please. Police are clearing the tracks to enable services to be resumed. Thank you for your attention and your understanding. It's Mathilde. Can you see me? Come this way. Step aside, please. Police! OK, Alpha come with me, the rest keep looking. Don't move. - Until when? - I don't know, madam. - There are no trains at all? - None at all. I've got a cramp! I can't move! Can't you see? Sir! Let the lady through, she's in pain. I have a cramp. Excuse me... I was here first! Madam! I was in front of you! Madam, what do you want? I want my ticket from my pocket! I'm stuck in this position! Sit down, it will pass. - Can you get my phone? - No, I can't. She can't talk to you. She's unwell. OK. A man with a Russian accent. He'll meet you here tomorrow morning at nine. That's good news. Thank you. You attention please, due to the presence of people on the tracks, all traffic at this station has been suspended. I will be like this until tomorrow. Yes, it's written on the paper. You stuck too? My train isn't going anywhere. There's no point standing around until it does. I'm not panicking. I'm not panicking like you. Everyone should deal with their own problems. I'm not panicking like you. I'm not panicking like you. - Have you found your daughter? - Not yet. But I just found this. What is it? I wondered if it could be hers. Look. It says: 'This book belongs to: Va..." Her name is Vanessa. And the handwriting is similar. "Don't come, don't come... My dream to defend..." "Nostalgic. Confused... Distant." I just found it in the crowd under the timetables board. Perhaps she just lost it. - Maybe she's here. - Maybe. That's my book. I just lost it. "Promise at Dawn". No, it can't be. Look... Give it to him! I'm very fond of it. There was a woman here. She's gone now. I interviewed her for your thesis. I didn't record it because I didn't have the Dictaphone. - Joan has it. - Who? - Joan, my former student. - Oh, yes. And... it was the woman from the dry cleaners. Unlike me, she was beautiful... - You're beautiful too. - No, listen. She was covering for somebody. It wasn't her regular job. Listen to what she said: "My real job is in geriatric care. I'm an auxiliary nurse. I stopped because I wanted a change but I think I'll go back to it soon. At fourteen, I liked people who were about 60 years old. I’ve always been like this. I like looking after old people. I don't call it a job, I call it a vocation. I had an old lady. I did her shopping and cleaning. She had worked in a bank. She'd been a bank manager in Paris. She told me what she used to do. I've always liked old films and photos, and seeing how people lived and how they were dressed. I like anything which is old and antique. I like old stuff." You like the past? Not me. - The woman from the cleaners. - Yes. - Is she French? - Yes. French people love the past. Not all of them. For example, I love you. Let's go. But first, I'll take you to a room I know. Where I'll slowly take off your coat. I'll see your blouse underneath it. I’ll see your breasts. I'll be moved. I'll be waiting... I'll unfasten your skirt. You'll move a little and the skirt will fall down. I’ll see the top of your thighs, I'll touch you. I'll touch your bare legs. I’ll caress your hips. Then I'll return to your breasts, I'll cup them in my hands like two little sparrows. - I've got one! - Two thousand! - Three thousand! - Four! Ten thousand! Fifteen thousand! Sixteen thousand, end of story. - Seventeen thousand. - 17,500. Eighteen thousand! - Nineteen thousand! - Twenty thousand! Only one. I said one life for sale tonight. We were up to 20,000. Eighty thousand! - What? - Where did she come from? I'll buy a new life for 80,000. I want to change my life. We don't change lives. Eighty thousand. I'm selling a life. I take a death. But which one? You choose. Which one? The brunette? The blonde? The young girl? The old lady? - No, don't do it. - You'll lose everything! - Is that your dog? - Yes. Keep him on a lead. He's walking all over the place. You can go on the platform at four when the station opens. Sir, there's a place here. I don't speak French well. - Are you Italian? - Yes. I understand a little Italian. I had some major problems over there. I had to leave Holland. The factory closed. Everybody was out of work. Nobody could find a job. The psychiatrist gave me medication. They put a microchip in my brain. Because of that, I get cramps. And I get heart palpitations. The microchip is connected to the psychiatrist's office. That way, he can monitor all of my movements. Behind my eyes there are tiny cameras. That way the psychiatrist can see everything I see. I don't get a moment's peace. He controls me from inside. Nowadays, when I meet the psychiatrist in the street, I don't say hello. I don't say hello to him. Look at this girl. You can tell if a woman is loved. - That's right. - Call my husband and tell him. - Would you like a drink? - I'd like a coffee. A coffee, please. - Coffee? - Yes, please. - What about weekends? - Every other weekend. - Are your parents pleased for you? - I haven't seen them for years. - So how old are you? - Twenty. Twenty? OK, I've finished my shift. I'm tired now. I'm going now. Thanks for the coffee. Bye. You're welcome. Thank you. Joan, do you remember me? Yes, the sociologist. Mathilde gave you a Dictaphone for me. - Yes, it's at my house in Lille. - I really need to get it back. Because it has her voice on it. Can I come to Lille with you to get it? - Your Dictaphone? - Yes. You don't have a ticket. Mathilde died this morning. SUBTITLES: RED BEE MEDIA FRANCE / monQ
