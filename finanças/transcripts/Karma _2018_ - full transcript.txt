No, no, I can't... - You're having a bad dream. - We're not safe. - I can't sleep here. - You're safe. It's okay. No, I can't. You have to call Father Esposito. - Mom, lie down and relax. - We need to cleanse. - I can't. I can't. - Yes, you can. You have to call Father Esposito. - Mom, no. - We need a cleanse. - We need a cleanse. - Okay. Okay. But please, relax, relax. Okay. Okay. Here. [PILLS RATTLE] Here. Water. Relax. Okay? Promise. - You promise, Father... - Promise. I will call. - Okay? Relax. - Okay. [SIGHS] It's okay. This is all my fault. I understand he's your friend. - Kevin... - You don't owe me any favors. I get that. Just, please... my mom, she's sick. - Your decision. - Two hours. I can't move my mom. Please, I'm begging you. You have two hours. You don't want to do this. Adharma. Everything I did... - We're family. - ...it didn't work. It uses the people you love to make you suffer. How do I protect her? How do I stop this? I told you that you don't want to do this. There's only one way this ends. [VOICES WHISPERING INDISTINCTLY] How do you think this is going to end? You do what you have to. [CELL PHONE VIBRATES] [PHONE RINGING] Pick up. Ugh! [PHONE LINE TRILLING] [SIGHS] Hey, Carmen. How are you? No, it's Alicia. Is Carmen okay? No, not really. It's just... I think something is terribly wrong, and I know it sounds crazy, but I think we need to try anything we can right now. I'm so sorry to call so late. It's okay, Alicia. Tell me what you think is going on. I don't know. I've felt things. Manny has seen things. My mom was attacked by something. And I don't think my dad's death was an accident. Why didn't you say anything this afternoon? Because we thought we figured it out or solved it. I think we're in danger, or cursed by something. - Do you need me to come by? - Can you? Of course I can. When? Now? Okay, I'll get there as soon as I can. Thank you, Father. [SIGHS] What are you doing here? My mom. She's sick. You're making a huge mistake. [DOOR CREAKS] [MUSICAL STING] Adharma. [EXHALES] [OMINOUS MUSIC] ♪ ♪ [VENTILATOR HISSING AND BEEPING] ♪ ♪ [SIGHS] Hail Mary... full of grace. The Lord is with thee. Manny. [GRUNTS] Manny. Pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death. You keep making the wrong choices. I'm not going to make it easy. I'm not just going to kill myself. It doesn't matter. Kevin couldn't kill himself either. [COUGHS] [KNOCK ON DOOR] [EXHALES, SNIFFLES] Thanks, Father, for coming so late... Um... can I help you? Oh, are you okay? There's been an accident. [WHIMPERING AND PANTING SOFTLY] Your suffering has just begun. You should have listened to Alicia. But you just ran away. You came here to protect her? You dumb son of a bitch. Can I get you a phone, or...? Thank you, ma'am. Okay, I'll... I'll be right back. You're too late. You can't save her. You're too late, Manny. There's no point. [FRANK LAUGHS] [SIGHS] Oh. - Could you...? - Thank you. Thank you, ma'am. Um, actually, if you could just... [SHUSHES] Is this your husband? Yes. Like father, like son-in-law, I guess. Did you know my father? - Who are you? - Me? I'm just another poor bastard that had his life destroyed by your family. Sir, I need you to leave. Hmm. You know... my wife used to say, "Cancer ain't no death sentence, honey." But then I watched her body turn on her. We tried everything. Everything. Everything we could. It's strange that it never happens to bad people, though. I'm sorry about your wife, but my family's here. [SIGHS] Yeah, this feels good. This is... this is homey. We celebrated Christmas at our home this year. And then four months later... I didn't just lose my wife and a home. I lost everything. Everything. - I'm sorry about your loss... - And then people like your dad and your husband come in like... vultures. They are the bad people, the liars and the cheats. You know what I call it, that your dad's head was almost sawed off in my driveway? Justice. Your dad and your husband tried to kill me with their disregard. My husband is in the other room. Oh, is he? [CELL PHONE RINGS] Oh. Well, then I guess we don't need to talk to him on the phone, now, do we? Shit. [PHONE RESUMES RINGING] He must really want something from... from the other room. He's impatient. [SCREAMS] [PANTING] [MARKHAM GROANING] [GROANING AND PANTING] Mm. Mm-hmm. All these... all these... these things... all these... these bought... bought on the backs... of good people. Like me. Good people... like me. [CLICKING SOUNDS] Oh... Alicia? Oh, my God! Alicia! Who... who are you? [BOTH YELL] Mom, call the cops! No! - Get away from us! - Don't. [DOOR OPENS] Alicia! Alicia! You piece of shit. You're all the same. Look, man, I called the cops. Good. I was counting on that. Hopefully you invited that deputy, too, hmm? Mr. Markham, you don't want to do this. You remember my name. You... you remembered me? She has nothing to do with this. Please, I understand your pain. What Frank did is wrong... You know nothing about my pain. Look, put the knife down. Okay? Let her go and take me. Come on, take me. Believe me... you don't want to do this. I think... I think I do, though. I think I have to. No! [GASPS] [BREATHING HEAVILY] [GRUNTS] Wake up. Wake up. [GASPS] [BREATHING HEAVILY] [GASPS] Manny. It's okay. No, the cops are coming soon. You're going to be okay. It's okay, you're safe. You have to hang on, okay? It's gone. Are you okay? No. [LAUGHS] [KISSES] [POLICE SIRENS WAILING DISTANTLY] Oh, my God. Is everybody okay? Holy sh... Subtitles by explosiveskull
