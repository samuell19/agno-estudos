All right, want some chips? Want some chips? - Mate, do you want takeaway? - No, I... Bruv, I want wings, bruv, I don't want chips. I don't want what's in your box, bruv. - All right, get another one. - Hey. - I don't want you to have one, anyway. - Them chips are wet, bruv. Um, these chips are nice. - What the fuck are you doing? - What's all this? What's your problem, bro? Go speak to your auntie, Sam.

Apafa-what? Go back to fuckin' Africa, man. Is it... Stop foolin' about. You better upgrade them ankles! Go back to Africa. Only English around here, darlin'. I love your necklace. It was Nyagak's. Oh, is that your daughter? Mine's a real handful. You registered her yet? We should take a look at her, too. Perfectly normal. Those are pretty. These I've had since I was a little girl. Mm. These I gave to myself with a knife. When I found my family butchered. There are two tribes where I'm from. They're both killing each other. Depending on which one you belong to, you mark yourself. I marked myself with both. I survived by belonging nowhere. We lost her. When we crossed the sea. Hurry up! I think there's someone living there. Mm. Come. Come. I'm sorry. I lost track of time. You went outside? Wonderful. Wonderful! But maybe next time, we can use the table. All I can taste is the metal. You will get used to it. Hm! Mm, mm! Mm, mm, mm. We will thrive. I have seen jobs here. They give you a chance here. We can start a family. I am restless. My mother used to tell me a story. In our village, there was once an honorable but poor man who wanted a home of his own. He wanted it so badly, he began to steal from others. One day... he stole from an old man who lived by the river. He didn't know that this man was an apeth. A night witch. And so the thief could not know that when he built his home... the apeth, too, would live there. So, before long, the walls would whisper the spells of the apeth. From the shadows... the dead would come. The apeth would not stop... until he had consumed the man entirely. An apeth has arisen from the ocean. It has followed us here. It spoke to me. What did it say? We don't belong here. If we leave... and repay our debt... ...it would guide us back to her. To Nyagak. She's gone. My love, she's gone. - The sea took her. - You're not listening. - We survived. - If we missed something... English! - I will speak my mother's language. - Listen to what you are saying. - She lives! - She's dead! We have grieved enough. Enough. There is no witch. I had assured myself it was a dream. Perhaps I am... ...overwhelmed... imagining things that aren't there. But now I have looked into your eyes. You're a liar. Rial? ♪Hm, hm, hm ♪ Mama. Mama. Mama. Mama. Mama. Mama. - Mama. - Nya? Mama. Mama. Mama! ♪ Hm, hm ♪ Huh. You saw it. Bol. What are you doing? We have to destroy everything. It's cursed. - Everything we brought is cursed. - Bol, what are you doing? What are you doing? Leave it! Stop! No, that's my father's. We've been marked! What do you mean marked? What did you see? Wha... Bol? - Oh... Why? Don't! - Let... Don't leave me with nothing. Don't. He doesn't want to leave you. Perhaps if you spoke to him... Perhaps you think we're going mad. I think it's not healthy for you to be alone all the time. Dwelling with your thoughts. Tomorrow, we will find you something to do. Something in the community. Make friends, be good. - We are not like them. - We can be. You don't wonder what it tells me? You are right. Maybe you are mad. Frightening yourself with imaginary things in the dark. After all we've endured, after what we have seen... what men can do, you think it is bumps in the night that frighten me? You think I can be afraid of ghosts? It says I can get her back. And it says I should be afraid of you. This is our home. Oh... Help me. I'm cold. Help me, I... Help me. Help me. I can't breathe. Help me. - Help me. - I can't swim. I can't swim. I can't breathe! Mama? Mama? Mama? Mama? Mama. Nyagak? growling] This is my house. This is my house! Get out! Get out! Get out! Get out! Get out! This is my house! My house! Adam, uh... do you wanna get him some juice? So, Bol, what's goin' on? The house. The house. You havin' problems with the property? You wanna live somewhere else? Mm. Oh. Okay. - Yes? - Uh... Sure, yeah, we can look into that for you. But first, you have to tell me why. I mean, can you name me one of the problems? There are... vermin. Rats and bugs. They are making us sick. Rial is very ill. Has she seen a doctor? - Yes. - Good. He says... "Get out of the house." We have to move. Where? His house is bigger than mine. Bigger than mine, too. Uh... Look, mate, this is... this is gonna raise a lot of questions... Bol. I... They're gonna ask you why you're not adapting. - Adapting? - Adapting. We are adapting. I used to work in a bank, too, believe it not, back in the day, before they moved all the jobs... abroad. The point is, many of us, we end up in places we never thought we'd be. But I think... I think that's life trying to show you what kind of man you are. Do you know what I'm sayin'? I'm tryin' to work out what kind of man you are, Bol. I just need a new house. And we'll get you one. Right after the inquiry. - Inquiry? - Yeah. Look at the state of you. You're a mess. You don't look well, mate, you look ill. You don't smell good. You smell bad. You're not making any sense. It would have to be reported. And then... people, not me, but people are then gonna ask, "Why is he bitin' the hand that's feedin' him?" - We can live anywhere else. - There's rats everywhere. - Anywhere else. - Oh, right. So it's not about the rats. There's something... very wrong - in... - What is that? What is it? Tell me. Can't be that bad, you're laughin'. If you want me to make a fuss, mate, I will make a fuss. - Yes! - If you want me to do it, then I will. Yes! Bol. Hang on. Mama. Why don't you just leave? What? Why don't you just leave? We live here now. They're gonna kick you out anyway. I'm tryin' to help you. I'll give it a week. Must be big rats. Telling me that rats... did this? Come on, man. Well, I'm... I'm gonna have to report it now. Please. Please... No, I'm gonna have to. I'm gonna have to take photos. No, please. No. No. No! Let me fix it. We are not going back. Please. We are one of the good ones. Remember? We are not going back. Yep. All right then, mist... Mr. Majur, we will let you off with a warning this time. - Hang... hang on a minute. - Let me deal with it. Have you told them about the witch? You haven't told them? There's a great beast in this house. It followed us here. My husband's been chasing it all night with a hammer. It knows great magic. It's filling this house with ghosts. It torments my husband with visits from her. Nyagak. But my husband is a very stubborn man. He still believes he can deny it. You should put that into your report. We'd better write 'em up. They can kiss England goodbye. Dude, she was wearing her bedsheets. This is what they want. They like to see us crazy. Makes them feel like big men. They don't want to be reminded that it is them that are weak. How poor... and lazy... and bored they are. Rial. Now, sorry. - Sorry, sorry, sorry... - Rial. And you... You still idolize them. You beg them. And then you thank them for the unseasoned scraps they throw us. You eat them up. Let them send us back. But this is our home. We're going back. I'm leaving. With or without you. How quickly you forget everything we went through to get here. How quickly you forget our daugh... You are sick. This is our home. You are not going anywhere. This time, you talk to me. Where are you? Thief. Show yourself. Your life is not yours. You stole it. Repay what you owe. You are a beast. You are the beast. And I am the butcher. No matter where you go, I follow. You are mine now. What do you want? Your life for Nyagak. What? Take this knife and open your flesh. Your body for hers. Why don't you come for me yourself? You can't touch me. You can't touch me. You can't touch me. You can't hurt me. You're just a bag of tricks. Make yourself at home. Pictures can't hurt me. Why don't you sleep? No. No, no, stop! No, stop. Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Pictures can't hurt me. Pictures can't hurt me. Pictures, pictures, pictures can't hurt me. No! Rial! No. No, no. - Get off. - Come. - Get off me. - Come back. - Don't touch me! Stop! - Get back! - Stay in the house! - Get off me! Hey! Rial! Rial! Rial! Rial! Rial! Rial? Ohhhh! Oh! I know what you are. This is just a dream. Where is she? Who? My daughter. Who? Rial? Rial? Rial! Rial. Hey. Come. Come. It's okay. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. Rial? Rial. Rial. Look at me. Look. Look at me. We have to leave now. Now. We have to go. Come. Rial. Rial! Please, please, please, please. Rial. Please. Rial. Come. Come. Come. Rial, come. Come, come, come. Come. Hurry. Come, come, come. - Come, come forward. - We are going to make space. That's it. That's it now. - You have space for two more? - Too many. No. Two more! Two more! Two more! - Please! - Children only! Come, come, come. That's it. - No. Get off. - You have space! - No, no, no! You wait! - No, sir. No, sir. - Please! - Mama. That's it. Too many now. - We're full. We are full. - Please. - Wait. Wait! - Mama. I'm sorry. Now come... We have to go, sir. - I said children. You are not a child. - Wait... No! We have to go! We have to go! - No! - She... She's a child! She's a child! Please! Excuse me, excuse me, excuse me. Thank you. Nyagak! - Mama! - Nyagak! - Mama! Mama! - Nyagak! - Nyagak! - Sh, sh, sh. Mama! Mama! - Nyagak! - Mama! - Nyagak! Nyagak! - Mama! - Mama! - Nyagak! Mama! - Mama! Mama! - Sh, sh. Sh, sh. - It's fine. It's fine. It's fine. - Mama! Mama! Mama! Mama! - Nyagak! - Mama! Nyagak! Nyagak! You have no daughter. I'll protect you. Is she... Is she dead? Nyagak! Nyagak! Nyagak! No, let me go! Bol! Nyagak! Nyagak! I can bring her back. Sever his flesh. Give me his body... and I will give you what you want. Mama. Oh... This is what it wants. It will come for me now. Let me save her. I should have tried harder. I should have saved her. I see them, too. What do you see? I see her. All of them. From the boat, from home. And what does that make us? He's coming. He's coming. You must go. Go! You are mine. Aaaaah! I have to say goodbye now. I'm going home. Hello, Rial. Sorry to bother you. Uh, we work with Mark. May we come in? Come in. You seem well. Is there still a witch? Rial killed it. I think I might paint this room red. Hm. Are you completely mad? What about the rats? Perhaps I was being a little dramatic. Do you still see her? Nyagak? Your ghosts follow you. They never leave. They live with you. It's when I let them in, I could start to face myself. This is our home. We are happy here. They shouldn't be using a barbecue. And they shouldn't be doing that to the walls. All right, then. That'd be all. Right. Thank you, Mr. and Mrs. Majur.
