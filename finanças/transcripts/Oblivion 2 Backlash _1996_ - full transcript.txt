(spooky instrumental music) (engine roaring) (tense music) - I'm callin' you out, Stone. - C'mon, Marshall, we got better things to do. - It's a matter of respect, Miss Kitty. - Lights out, Marshal. (gun fire) (gasp) (gasping) (screams) - Nice catch. - Practice makes perfect. (groans painfully) I bring unfortunate tidings. You're father has met an untimely alleviation of existence. (wolves howl) - What? - He's dead. - How well did you know my father, Miss Chase? - He was a good man. You should've stood up for him in there. - One violent act leads to another, and then another in turn, and I won't be part of that cycle. - I'm wasting my time talking to you, cause you're not listening to me. (crashing) (evil laughing) - Stop it, get out! (cans clattering) - Oh, delicious. - So are you gonna take over being marshal now? - I don't want the top job. - So you're a quitter. - Look who's talking. - (scoffs)Look, I wasn't hired to do a job. - No, you just walked out on your father. (tense music) (deep growling) - You're gonna die, native. Ain't you afraid? - I fear nothing. (gurgling growl) (tense music) (growling) (groaning) (crowd yelling) (thudding) - Such a pain in the neck. (yelling) (whip cracking) (electric buzzing) (groaning) (laughing) - Howdy. (smacking) (gun fire) (gun fire echoing) (booming) - Doc. - I'm coming. I'm coming. I don't like this one bit. (clattering) How can I get any work done in here? - I am the only law this town has left. I have got to be here. I have to hold down the fort. - If I don't fix you up, you won't be holding down anything. (whip cracking) (electric buzzing) (agonized groaning) (whip snapping) - Stop it. Enough, that's enough. (laughing) - Don't get your knickers in a knot, princess. It'll all be over soon. - What's the problem, Miss Maddie? - Red Eyes kidnapped Miss Maddie. Now we're gettin' a posse together, and goin' after him to put an end to this thing once and for all. - [Crowd] Yeah. - So just you get the hell outta here, Zack. - And what about Maddie? - We'll send her back. We're not done with her. (thudding) - Shit. (whip snapping and buzzing) I'll sneak around this way. (tense music) (gun fire) (screaming) - Maddie. (loud roaring) (terrified screaming) (gun firing) (roaring) (screaming) (gun firing) (gun firing) (gun firing) Damn. (grunting) It's okay, it's okay. Was it your leg? - Yes, it's fine. - It's just a scratch. - Red Eye. (thudding) (claws snapping) (wet thudding) (screaming) (tense music) - To hell with it. (wet squishing) (painful screaming) (crashing) (roaring) (claws snapping) (screaming) (roaring) (claw snapping) (screaming) (wet ripping) (soaring instrumental music) (roaring) - It feels like it's got the weight of the world hanging on it. - You wear it well. (upbeat music) (spanish style music) (raucous laughter) (gasping) (pensive music) (door slamming) - I wouldn't do that if I were you. (spitting) (gun fire) (gasps) (thudding) - Those things'll kill ya. (whirring) (patrons laughing) - Who in the hell was that? - Lash. She's uh, she's the new owner. - I'll see you and I'll raise you 20. - 50. And another 50. (laughing) - C'mon Lash, you're tapped out. Another raise for me and you gotta fold. What's a night worth with you with you anyway, Lash, huh? You and me naked and horizontal and sweaty. Huh? (gun clicking) - You better watch your mouth, Crowley, or I'll put a window in your head. You never had the balls to make the move when Red Eye was around, though. (gun clicking) Five. - 500 sounds reasonable now, doesn't it boys? - Yes. - 5,000. - 5,000? What are you shitting me? - No, 5,000 me doing you. If you win. What's the matter Crowley, huh? Afraid? - I just can't cover 5,000 with what's here on the table, that's all. - What else you got? - I got me a mine. - A mine? (laughs) What kind of a mine, Crowley? - Derconium. Only the most valuable mineral in the galaxy. It eats energy systems for lunch. (thudding) - Call. - Royal flush, beat that. (laughing) - Oh shit! (pensive music) (heavy footsteps) (spurs clicking) - He looks nervous. - He's not nervous, Stell. He's focused. (horse whinny) - Zack. Miss Kitty and I have every confidence in you. (tense music) - Mr. Gaunt, can't say I'm happy to see you. - Smile Marshal, you wouldn't want to go out with a frown. (horse snorts) (sighs) - Wish me luck, fella. - I got 10 says he gets shot down. - Then you're on. (knocking) - Hello Marshal. You're right on time. So you ready for our date? - I tell you Lash, you have no idea how long I've been waitin for this moment. - Hold it. Maybe you weren't legit. - Oh hell, Lash, what are you trying to pull now? Are you tryin to welsh on our bet, or what? - I didn't see any proof of any derconium mine. Now I put myself up, you could've been lying. - I got the deed and the map. (paper crinkling) - There's no map here. - You're gonna love this. (zipping) I did the tattoo on myself. - Isn't that a little difficult to read? - Nothin a little romance couldn't enlarge. (chuckles) - Oh, aren't you clever. - Of course, just having the map wouldn't be enough, Lash. There's a lot of strange things been going on out at those mines, you know. Haven't you heard? The place is crawling with ghosts. (wet thud) - Give them my regards. (pained groaning) Bork. I'd like you to photocopy this. - Now how can I do that? - Improvise. - I know we got off on the wrong foot a little bit, Maddie. It's strange, you know? I am an empath. I sense how other people feel. I feel it. Just because I know how they feel, doesn't seem to make it any easier to communicate. You know? I've been out in the desert for the last five years, and by myself most of the time. I've been thinking a lot about how I should deal with people. (laughs) Or how I should deal with myself. I thought I had all the answers. But, well, I definitely knew that peace was the only way. You know? And here I am, marshal. And what am I supposed to do? Use violence to ensure peace? I know it's been difficult for you too, Maddie. You know, being a widow and all. There's a lot of creeps out there who would just leap at the chance of takin advantage of such a fine lady as yourself. But don't get me wrong, I got great respect for women like you. And like Miss Kitty, who managed to maintain their dignity and their womanliness in an hellhole like Oblivion. I want you to know, that I am here for you. As your marshal, as your friend, as, well, anything you damn well need me to be. - Zack, I haven't had sex in three years. - Is that earth years? (horse whinnying) - Wait a minute, wait a minute. I can't hear you all at the same time. Now, what did you hear? - What's going on, Buster? - Um, it just came in over the Ether. He was seen heading this way. He ship passed Rigel. And it's coming strait towards Oblivion. - Who's ship? Who is coming? - Sweeney. - Oh no. (grunts angrily) Not Sweeney. - I'm afraid so. - Oh damn. (lighthearted honky-tonk music) (patrons chattering) - Well, he's still not back. Think that means it's going well, Doc? - I think it's goin great. That's what I think. - Yeah, well you have to think that. You got money on it going great. - By the way, Stell. Stop by my shop tomorrow. Got some new backups I wanna try out for you. - My bionics? Doc, you know how I'd love not to be so dependent on them, especially with derconium around, but, last time you nearly killed me. - I got the bugs all worked out. Swear. - What's the matter, sweetheart? I got money. - And you've got breath that's curling the wallpaper, Long John. Get away from me. - Why should you care about the way I smell? You stupid whore. That's right. H-o-r, whore. - You're drunk. - Is that how we treat ladies at Miss Kitty's? - I don't see no ladies. - They're all ladies. Cause I say so. Is that alright with you? - Huh. - Huh? - Huh - Huh? (cracking) - Uh huh. - You're a regular around here, Long John. You should know that. - You're right, I should know that. That doesn't feel too bad. - I know what's good. (cracking) I know what you like. (cracking) I know what you like. Come right over here and take a nice catnap, and in the morning, things are just gonna seem purr-fect. C'mon, honey. Let's get you a drink. - Ahh, you haven't lost your touch, Miss Kitty. - Evenin' everybody. - Actually, Marshal, aren't you kind of without someone? Like your date? (sighs) - What am I doing wrong? Is it me? Is it him? What is it? - Zack's been alone a long time. It may be that he's just kinda rusty. - Buteo, good to see you. - How's things at Lash's? - Lash's? - Lash has taken over ownership of the cantina on the edge of the Badlands. Buteo here was kind enough to head out there and, - Subtly, of course. - See what's what. I hear gun running's her latest angle. - That turns out to be the least of our problems. - There's a problem with Lash and I didn't hear about it? How embarrassing. - It appears that we are going to be visited by, Sweeney. (surprised gasps) - [Patrons] Not Sweeney? - Who? - You've never heard of him? - He's the deadliest bounty hunter in the sector. - And they say he's 10 feet tall. - He's wider than a barn. - The strength of 10 men. - I heard 30. - They say he can kill a man just by lookin at him. - My kind of fellow. Who is he? - Sweeney's coming. - Not Sweeney. - You're afraid of him? - Afraid? No, but I may have a massive upsurge in business. Better check my coffin stock. (tense music) (electronic whirring) - You okay, Miss Kitty? - What do you want, Stell? - Just a drink. I'm on my way over to Doc's. I figured having a drink or two, or 12, it'd help me make it through his latest attempt at making my life better. But, uh, look, never mind. You look kinda busy. (bottle thudding) - I am. - Thanks. (mechanical whirring) (liquid pouring) You sure you're alright, Miss Kitty? Is there anything that I can do to help? I mean, after all, you know, I am deputy. To protect and serve, and, all that stuff. - I keep my own council. But, thank you. (mechanical whirring) - No problem. - So this whole rig tracks weather conditions. - Weather, seismic conditions, everything, for the whole region. - What's this dark mass comin in from the south? What's that supposed to be? (electronic beeps) - God damn insects. Ahh, Stell. - Doc. - Just in time. (mechanical whirring) - I'm not so sure about this. - Trust me, this won't hurt a bit. (mechanical whirring) - Doc. (laughing) (gasping) - It's entirely using pulleys, miniaturized counter weights, springs, cogs, duplicates the strength of your normal bionic arm. But it isn't energy dependent. (laughs) - Are you sure about this, Doc? - Well, let's try something simple. Here's a rock. Make a fist. (delighted Laughing) (rock cracking) (laughing) (strained mechanical whirring) - Doc. I can't un-clench my fist. - Try. - I am trying. (zapping) - Well try harder. (smashing) (surprised yell) - Doc, you. (loud rumbling) - What the hell is that? - A ship? A small one, from the sound of it. Powerful engine, though. - Zack, we have a visitor. (loud rumbling) - God damn it, Doc, put my old arm back on. (metallic screeching) (crowd yelling) (pensive instrumental music) - [Zack] Buteo, is this uh, - [Buteo] Sweeney's ship, yes. - Oh, Stell. Good to see you're not unarmed. (sighs) - Ahh, hello. Are you the local constable? - Well, I'm the marshal, yeah. My name's Zack Stone. This is my Deputy, Stell Bar. And this here's Buteo. - Yes, of course you are. And I'm. - Not Sweeney. - Oh, you've heard of me. How smashing for you. - You're Sweeney? The bounty hunter? - The very same. Now I was hoping we could repair to somewhere civilized. I'm absolutely parched. There's a matter of some urgency, which I would like to discuss with you, Marshal. Hello. Can I help you chaps? - So you're Sweeney? - Oh, you people love redundancy, don't you? Ah, Marshal, I do believe these men are endeavoring to provoke me. Do you tolerate such displays? - Well, from what I hear, the famous Sweeney can handle damn near anything himself. - I wouldn't say that. - Is it exaggeration? - No, it's profanity. And I chose not to use such words in front of a lady. And do grow up. - Okay boys, break it up. - We're just having fun. (laughing) - Marshal, if you would indulge me, sir. - Be my guest. - Here. (smacking) Right. Now, about that drink. - Uh yeah, the saloon's right this way. (cracking) (agonized groaning) - Thank you, my dear. And your name, again, is? - Miss Kitty. This is my place. - Saloon and cat house. How unoriginal. And yet, right. Bottoms up. (ding) - Mr. Sweeney, my name it Gaunt. I am the local dispenser of terminal festivities. - Oh, the funeral director. - It's an honor to meet you, sir. Imagine, the winner of the medal of honor from the Funeral Brotherhood, five years in a row. - I was younger then, Mr. Gaunt. Burning with ambition. It was back when the feds were running things. What a sorry lot, they were. So I've been cutting back recently. All the senseless violence, and the killing and the mayhem, the fun goes out of it after a while. - What a horrible thought. - No, I've just been trying to be more selective about taking on new business. - And what new business brings you to Oblivion, Sweeney? - You're straight forward, Marshal. I like a man after my own heart. Well, actually, not always. Once there was a man after my own heart, and I had to strangle him with his own intestines. (choking) - Your business. - Yes, of course. I've been hired by Galaxicorp. There's a woman they've been after for years now, with little success. And they were rather pleased when I chose to take on this assignment. I've traced her to this world. Thanks to a variety of leads. Some cooperative, and uh, some less so. - What is her name? - What does she look like? - That would be of little help, I'm afraid. She's had so many names and undergone so many changes of appearance, that descriptions of either would be useless. - What's she accused of doing? - Corporate spying. Sabotage. From all accounts, she's quite attractive in whatever her appearance happens to be. Cunning, ruthless, conniving, underhanded, double dealing. Truthfully, I don't know whether to capture her, or propose to her. (laughs) Do you know any women who fit this description? It could be. As I say, the appearance changes. Any idea where she is? - Sure do. You can be there inside a day or two. - She is a troubled woman. Who knows the forces that shape such a desperate creature. - You're not sorry for her? - I am sorry for the circumstances that created her. Do not judge Lash too harshly, Stell. Lest you judge yourself too. - He's a rather depressing chap to have around, isn't he? - Well, I'm not. - Would you like me to kill him for you? - No, no. - Sweeney, Buteo and I will assist you. - Yeah, as you wish. - We'll hit the cantina first. We ought to be able to find a lead on Lash there. Stell, Lash stops in town, I want her gift wrapped, and behind bars. Understand me? - You got it. - Let's ride. - Bye, bye. (yelling) - That's it, the Native Wall. - Are you sure? I thought it's supposed to be a couple miles south of here. - No, you idiot. That is the place. Now, men believe it it haunted with the ghosts of the ancient natives. (laughs) Women know better. - Ghosts? Can I maybe not have to go inside, then, huh? - Oh Bork. You'll stand guard, okay? (sighs) (upbeat instrumental music) - There they are. (tense music) (water dripping) - Oh yes. Yes. (gasps) Perfect. Power drained, a good sign. Oh, how thoughtful. (scratching) (animal chattering) Derconium, the mother lode, yes. Excuse me. (animal crying) (panting) Oh fantastic. Yes. (pensive music) Yes. Oh please. Oh baby. Let me just touch you. Oh. (pleasurable sigh) (pounding) (cracking) (gasping) (rumbling) Oh no. (rocks crashing) Damn. (coughing) Crowley, you son of a bitch. If you weren't dead, I'd kill you. (sighs) (panting) Bork. Bork! Bork. Bork. Bork, you brainless lummox. Where the hell are you? (sobbing) Bork. - Forgive me. (heavy thudding) (laughing) - Bork. Oh, Bork, Bork. Bless you, bless you. Just for this, I'll cut you in for one half, of one percent, that is net profit, of course. Bork? (rocks shifting) Oh, who are you? Oh look, just never mind. Do you think you could be so kind, as to get me out of here. (smacking) - [Bork] Lousy bushwhackers. - You know, if I didn't have this major aversion to killing, I could simply shoot him. - Your ethics do you credit. - Alright. - Stay away from me or else, (thudding) (groaning) - How did this happen? - Booby trap. - Yes, so I see. Uh, perhaps it wouldn't be terribly wise for me to come in there, in case there are more surprises. You'd better hold on while I see if I can find a rope. - Oh. - Take you out of there. - Oh, no, no, no, don't bother. Just take that. Alright, thank you. This is really awfully kind of you. (yelling) (thumping) - What the hell was that hand thing? - Well, it was worth a try. - Alright, old girl? - My clothes are a mess. Oh, but, you know, otherwise, I'm fine. Thank you for asking. - Look, this probably a terrible time to bring this up, but my name is Sweeney, and I'm afraid you're under arrest. - Oh, there must be some misunderstanding. - I'm afraid not. I'll take that whip, if you don't mind. (clicking) - Fine. - And ladies first. - May I at least get my flashlight? - Certainly, just don't try any monkey business. - Oh please. You've got me all wrong, Sweeney. This whole thing is terribly shocking. (zapping) (agonized groaning) (chuckling) (clicking) Now how did that get on? - Hello, Lash. Just give me a reason to shoot you. (sighs) (zapping) (Lash groaning) (tense music) - Now, that wasn't too terribly hard, was it? (slapping) - I didn't do it, I'm innocent. - Didn't do what, Lash? - Name it. - Murder. - Nope. - Assault and battery? - Uh uh. - Prostitution? (laughs) - No way. - Gun running. - Oh please. - Try espionage and sabotage. - Huh? Now wait a minute. Those I really didn't do. - You didn't commit those crimes. - I can't even spell those crimes, for heaven's sake. - What about the Native Wall, Lash? What were you doing there? - Oh, well I was sight seeing, Marshal. Or is that against the law too, huh? - She's lying. - I expect she is. At any rate, I'll be turning her over to the Galaxicorp and they will dispose of her accordingly. - The Galaxicorp? Marshal, please, you can't let him take me to Galaxicorp, Marshal. You know what, why? Because, Marshal, I'll do anything. - Lash. - Yes? - He's a legitimate representative of the Galaxicorp. Now you're wanted for crimes off this planet. I only have one choice, that's to allow them to extradite you. - Oh, no, no, no, no, Marshal, Marshal. Now, you have plenty of choices. - No, I only have one. And that's to follow the law. - Oh how noble of you. (metal jangling) - It's nothin personal. - The hell it isn't. - I've inputted the data, you do the paperwork, and then somehow I'll manage to tear myself away from your charming establishment. - Ah, no, no, no, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah nah. - Lash. - Yes? - Stick it. - Hey. Hey, this isn't over yet. Shit. - And you just left Bork lying there? - He was much to heavy to transport. - Oh yes, I guess he would be. Oh Zack, Doc wanted me to tell you that that magnetic storm set in. - Well, it looks like you're stuck here for a while, Sweeney. - [Sweeney] What in heaven's name have I done do deserve this, and what the hell am I supposed to do here? - Zack, I have to, oh. (soaring instrumental music) I see you have company. - Sweeney, this is. - A vision of loveliness. A gentle oasis breeze wafting across the desert of my soul. My name is Sweeney, the Sweeney. Perhaps you've heard of me? - I'd heard you were utterly ruthless. - Your name wouldn't be Ruth, would it? - Maddie. Maddie Chase. - Then I remain Ruth-less still. - You know, Miss Chase, I've seen so little of your town. And granted, there's nothing worth seeing, but then, I wouldn't mind seeing nothing with you. - I'd be delighted. Unless, of course, Zack, you wouldn't have any objection, would you? (thumping) - Why would I? You're a full grown woman. (ominous music) She's just doin that to make me jealous, you know. - Mmm, that's funny. It looked to me like she was doing it because she liked him. - That is correct. - Buster, I'd rescue Lash, but it's the kind of thing that needs thinking, and thinking makes my head hurt. Ouch. - So ah, what are you gonna do, Bork? What are you gonna do? It ain't gonna sit to well with her, you ah, sittin here on your ass. It won't, it won't sit well. (door creaking) (ominous music) (door slamming) - Red Eye. - Back from the dead. - Red Eye rots in hell. I am Jaggar, his brother. Where is Lash? (stammering) (stammering) - Let me, uh, go get you something to drink. (whimpering) - I hate him. I really hate him. I really, really hate him. I hate his guts. I'd like to squeeze his head until his brain oozed out through his nostrils. (honky-tonk music) (patrons laughing) - Well what does she think she's doin up there anyway? - Perhaps she's trying to force you into action. You think of her as a fragile widow, still in mourning, instead of a red-blooded woman with desires. - Zack, when it comes to relationships, you can't think about everything so much. I mean, hell, if we all walked around thinkin all the time, none of us would get involved with anyone. Huh, oh. I don't think that came out quite right. - Sometimes being impulsive is preferable. - Actions speak louder than words. (tense music) (breathing heavily) - Well what the hell did you do this girl? Get outta here. (smacking) - Oww. (patrons gasp) - I'm sorry, she started it. It's her fault. (hard smacking) Oww. (whacking) (yelling) - Miss Kitty. (thudding down the stairs) (groaning) - Are you okay? - He just, just roughed me up a bit. (sobbing) - Go get cleaned up. - Stell, take him over to Doc Valentine's, get him patched up, and then escort his butt out of town. - Never comin back here, I swear. - And it's a good thing too. - C'mon, c'mon, c'mon. - [Sweeney] Yes, good riddance. (hissing) - Zack, what are you gonna do? You're not gonna. - Arrest her? No. She's been too good to me an my father all my life, and my dad had special feelings for her. No, I'm not gonna arrest her, I'm just gonna have a talk with her. - Promise me, whatever is wrong, you'll straighten it out? Swear you will. - I swear. - So, this Marshal Stone captured Lash. - I think so. There was hitting, lot's of hitting. It's hard to remember. - And he is also the one responsible for Red Eye's death? - Uh, yes, uh, you have our sympathy, sir. - Red Eye deserved what he got. - Lash's capture, however, is a matter of inconvenience. Unless, can you lead me to the mine? - Only if we get Lash. Only if. - You are an incredible simpleton. - Thanks. - You're welcome. - It's none of your business, Zack. - I say it is. Now, Miss Kitty, I know things are eating you up inside, I can feel it. - Well you're gonna feel these if you don't get out of here. - Now, Miss Kitty, threatening a man of the law is a crime. Lucky for you, there's only friends here. Oh hell, I'll deal with this tomorrow. - Zack. Sweeney wants me. (tense music) - Sweeney wants you? - He doesn't want Lash, he wants me. - Oh boy. - All this happened years ago. Galaxicorp, they tried to set up a mining operation on Antos Four. They gutted the place. They tore down mountains, and woodlands, houses. They made a parking lot out of paradise. Now legally, it was above board, because, you know, a few palms got greased. But people lost their houses, their world. (sighs) So war was declared. - By whom? - By me. I was hot stuff in those days. Not the cool cat you see in front of you now. Well, let me tell you what happened. I infiltrated some of their systems, wrecked their computers. I even blew up some of their mining installations. Anything to make mining more trouble than it was worth. - Well, then what happened? - They torched it. The whole world. They torched it in retaliation for my activities, the whole thing's on my head. - My god, Miss Kitty. But how could you know that they would. - I should have. - Miss Kitty, you've got to come forward now. - I can't do that, Zack, they'll kill me. Well, you're the marshal. Arrest me. My life is in your hands. - Are you serious? - Yes. - Zack, what are you gonna do? Are you gonna keep quiet about it? - Well, if I do, then Lash has to pay for Miss Kitty's crimes. - Good riddance. - Maddie. - Zack, the woman has the morals of a night scorpion. I'd swap Miss Kitty for her any day. - Well, it's not that simple. - Yes, it is. You're just complicating things. (ominous music) - I, I think I'll come back later. - My apologies. Miss Maddie, you said you would be getting in my favorite blend of tea? - Oh yes, the Earl Black. I ah, keep it in the back room. The packaging frightens the customers. I'll be right back. - What's wrong, Marshal? You look like some of your best friends just died. Did they? - No. - Oh. - Mr. Gaunt, how do you advise someone when they have to make a difficult decision, they have two choices, and they don't like either one? - I tell them a third choice is always possible. - Really? - Yes, and that's when I bring out the mahogany caskets. It's pricier than pine or walnut, but it's worth it. - Thanks. - Anytime. - Ah. (sniffing) (sighing) - I'm eternally grateful. (sighing) - So there we were, on this obscure planet, me, the captain, and his first officer chap, and this charming woman named Blaze. This was the moment they actually chose to attack. Well. Excellent timing, Marshal. Good cup of Joe, by the way, too. I've filled out these forms as you requested. All that's required is your signature. - I'm afraid I can't release Lash to you, Sweeney. - I beg your pardon. - She's wanted for crimes on Oblivion. - Yes, but certainly these don't take precedent over her crimes against the Galaxicorp. - What happened Zack? - Nothing. Just can't have her, that's all. We have to try her on Oblivion. If she's found guilty, she'll serve her sentence. - Aww hell, Sweeney, why don't you just come on back in, I don't know, say ah. - A few years, maybe. - Yeah, a few years maybe. - Please understand, I do have a sense of humor. But right now, I'm not laughing. - I'm not joking Sweeney, you can't have her. - Why not? - Because he knows I didn't do it. Isn't that right, Marshal? That's gotta be it. Well, am I close? - Is she? Is this the woman I want, or not? - That's not the point. - Then what is? Is this about Miss Chase? - No. Yes. Aww, whatever. You wanna know what the point is, Sweeney? - It would be nice to think one is imminent, yes. - The point is, this is my town, not yours. I don't care if you are the galaxy's deadliest bounty hunter, or even the great god Culker, himself. I say she stays, and that's all that matters. You don't like it, I'm afraid we can step outside, and settle this like men. - Oh, wonderful. (thumping) - Whoa.

(roaring) (chanting in foreign language) No more Mr. Nice Guy. (hard whack) (cracking) (growling) Hand Lash over to me. - He will not be handing Lash over to anyone. (groans) (thuds) Except me. (panting) - Red Eye, I saw you die. - No, I am Jaggar. High Lord of the Okuda. Red Eye's smarter brother. I have business dealings with Lash. You will give her to me. - Not in this lifetime. - Right. - I will be taking her. - Don't help me. - I repeat, you will release her to me, or I will decimate this town. - And this will cause my ship to detonate, and it will take you, and me, and Lash, and this whole pathetic little town, and blow it to kingdom come. - You're bluffing. - Alright, you're all under arrest. (beeping) (guns clicking) (beeping) - You're all under arrest, please. - Each of us has a claim on Lash, Marshal. - It's up to you, Marshal. - Go with caution, Zack. - How about this, Marshal, we cut her in half, vertically? - Any other ideas? - No, that about does it. - You've been a big help. - I'll tell you what to do. Let Lash and Jaggar do their business. Sweeney doesn't want her anyhow. I'm the one you want, bounty hunter. - You? - The marshal was covering for me. A matter of honor. That's something you can understand. A gentleman of your breeding. - Yes, well of course. But you? - You want the saboteur in the matter of Antos Four. She who went by the name of Ariel Gwen Shauna? - You were she? - The very same. - Now, the people of this town have been real good to me. And the young man that I am proud to call my, my sincere friend, so there's no way I can be a coward. I challenge you, Sweeney, by the code of the League of Bounty Hunters, you and me. - You know our rules well, Ariel Gwen Shauna. - Call me Kitty. And catch me if you can. (chuckles) - You've made it too easy, my dear. (zapping) Ah, a hologram transmission. How terribly clever of you. So you have a head start on me. But nevertheless, I will catch you. - If you can. - This is marvelous, Marshal. I haven't had so much fun in years. - You aren't just going to fly after her in your ship? - Well that wouldn't be much bloody fun, would it? - Marshal, I believe you have someone I want. - You didn't really think you could keep me in this cell, did you Marshal? But let me just see if I've got this straight, huh? So, on the one hand, you were more than happy to turn me over to Sweeney. Even though I maintained my innocence. And on the other, you were more than happy to front for your precious Miss Kitty. Nothing personal, you said. Bullshit. - Once Zack knew the truth of the situation, he fought to prevent Sweeney from taking you. - Only to cover for her. - It's not exactly like your a pillar of the community, Lash. Hell, we could still bust your ass for kidnapping, gun running. - You see, I didn't have any choice. Red Eye, he forced me to do those things. - Attempted murder. - Why don't you call me when you have proof, you borg bitch. - No. - Lash. Before I set Stell loose on ya. - Oh, Marshal, Marshal. I just want you to know that I'm not gonna forget any of this. And when it comes time to settle the score between you and me, I promise you, it's going to be pretty damned personal. (spits) Have a nice day. (slap) - You're a woman of rare fire, Lash. - And you're a man of rare timing, Jaggar. The auction isn't for another two days. - I'm not concerned with the auction, I've come to steal the derconium from you, or offer you as sizable fortune for it. Depending upon what kind of person you turned out to be. - And what kind have you decided me to be? - I begin to understand what Red Eye saw in you. Of course, your skin is disgustingly smooth. But then, there is some exotic appeal to that. - Tell me, Jaggar, do all your kind share the remarkable, uh, stamina that Red Eye displayed? - No. - No? - Most of us exceed it. (gasps) - Really? - Yes. - Well, come on then. (electronic whirring) - "In a one on one, an observer must "be in attendance to make sure the capture "is clean and in accordance with local laws." League of Bounty Hunters, Rule five, section two, subheading nine. In other words, I'm coming with you. - I believe the wording says that an observer may be in attendance. - Well on this world, my world, it's a must. - Good for you. Lead the way. - Ho. (door creaking) (pensive music) - We really should be getting to the mine. - Yes, we really should. But I'm in no hurry. - Neither am I. I'm going to kill you after you've showed me the mine. - Oh, and I was going to kill you after I got the money. (laughs) - Just don't rub my scales the wrong way. - Oh, of course not. (sighing) (groaning) (birds calling) - Ah, bingo. (ethereal music) - Oh no, not again. (tense music) (horse clomping) - Whoa. How the hell'd you get here so fast? - I believe it's called horsemanship, dear fellow. (electronic beeping) - Oh, yes. Shall we? (water dripping) (metallic pinging) (air hissing) Ah hah, well, she's in there alright. And of course, this thing will be useless once we're inside. Derconium, you know? - Yeah, but maybe she set some sort of trap. - I know. Exhilarating, isn't it? Kitty? Here, Miss Kitty. Come out, come out, where ever you are. - Gotcha. Bastard. (grunting) - How's your light keep working in here? - Elementary my dear chap, I bought it in your town. Listen. (rattling) - Oh, one of Doc Valentine's hamster-powered, treadmill things. - Exactly. - How much you pay for that? 19.95? - 29.95. - Is it me, or does this ground feel weird? - Marshal, you are weird. (lighter flicking) - Shit. - You hear that? Sounds like a snake hissing. - Possibly Miss Kitty deflating. (lighter clicking) (hissing) - Somethin smells funny. - (sighs) Natural gas, perfectly normal. - Pretty dangerous business to me, Sweeney. - Not so long as it doesn't interact with a naked flame, you are perfectly safe, Marshal. Where's that good old cowboy spirit, eh? Let me tell you, Marshal, there was a time when men were men. (deep rumbling) (screams) - What the heck was that? (roaring) - Lovely, just lovely. - C'mon, give me your hand. - Whoa. (loud pounding) Pull, pull. - I am pulling, swim. (guttural growling) - I can't. (splashing) - Sweeney. (tense music) (fuse sizzling) (growling) - Something's eating me alive. (splashing) Pull you yokel - Sweeney, kick, kick. - Zack. (frantic splashing) - God, Sweeney. (labored groaning) (grunting) A hell of a time to go for a swim, Sweeney. - I expect you think that's funny. (flame roaring) (loud explosion) (cavern rumbling) (men yelling) (fire roaring) (splashing) (low growling) - Sweeney, get me out of here. You're right, there is something in there. It's big, it's really. - Of course there is, boy. Give me your hand. (frantic splashing) (stone rumbling) - Sweeney, oh my god, look. - Your hand. (grunting) - What the hell was that thing? - Zack? Zack. Get out of here. - Look what the cat dragged in. - C'mon, get out of here. - Pleased with your handiwork, my dear. - The place is gonna blow. C'mon. - Okay. I'm coming. (grunting) (rock creaking) (rock rumbling) - Your turn, go on through. - Give me your hand. Reach. (crashing) (screaming) Miss Kitty. (loud rumbling) No. - Justice has been served. C'mon, ducky. (tense music) (loud explosion) (mountain rumbling) (stone crashing) (loud roaring) (thunderous roaring) (rock cracking) - Not much further, my love, to the mother-lode of all mother-lodes. - And may we both get what we have coming to us. - Oh my god. (rumbling footsteps) - [Lash] Hurry. - [Jaggar] I'm hurrying. - [Lash] Let's get out of here. - Holy moley. C'mon you dumb mule. (yelling) (roaring) (booming footsteps) (terrified screams) - I will, of course, report her demise. Whether she met her end through being crushed, or digested, or well, whatever happened to her, she's most certainly gone. The case will be closed. If the Galaxicorp double check with you, I assume you will verify my account of the events. It's very difficult to collect a bounty when there's not much of a body left to identify. - Well god forbid, you should lose out on any of your reward, Sweeney. - After all, money's all that matters. - It's amazing how you manage to take such pleasant words as reward, and money, and make them sound distasteful. - They mourn the passing of Miss Kitty. - Oh, believe it or not, so do I. Then again, if I have to chose between mourning her wealthy, and mourning her impoverished, I'd be something of an utter twit to choose the later, now wouldn't I? Gentlemen. Ladies. Lady. You know, my dear, you could still come away with me. The choice is still yours, it's not too late. - Oh, I um, I hate to say this, Sweeney, but. - You hesitate. Then at least give me a farewell kiss. - She's with me. (soaring instrumental music) - I'm with him. - As you wish, my dear. Treat her well, Zack. If you don't, she might put a price on your head, and then I'd have to come by and collect it. (engines whirring) (bell ringing) - It may seem that the notion of Oblivion continuing in it's normal manner, would be impossible, for Miss Kitty, so much embodied all that we love and cherish about this great town of ours. She was a part of every aspect of our lives. But, my dear friends, that is what give us the strength to go on. Because Miss Kitty, in her way, will live on, in each and every one of us. If anyone would care to add a few words to my stirring eulogy, they may come forward now. My dear, how well did you know the deceased? - Better than anyone. (surprised gasps) - Tar-nation. - I don't believe it. - Culker moves in mysterious ways. - You were gone, I was there. I saw it, I felt it. - Oh, I died, Zack. At least, the Miss Kitty who lived in fear of her past. She died. - No, no, no, no, you're gonna have to do better than that, Miss Kitty. - Nine lives. - Sorry, Miss Kitty. For once, you're gonna have ta be honest with us. Even if we have to stand here all day and all night. - Free drinks for everyone at my place. - Alright. (laughing) C'mon, let's go. (cheering) - For the first time ever, I cancelled Bingo out of respect for a Thursday funeral, and look what happens. - I'm so sorry, Mr. Gaunt. - It's alright. You'll make it up to me. (spanish style music) - Nine lives, Miss Kitty? C'mon. - Sometimes you just have to take things on faith. - No, I wanna know. Was it a plan, or was it luck, when you sacrificed yourself for Sweeney and me? - Forget it, Zack. Miss Kitty loves her secrets, and she keeps her own counsel. - Women, I must admit I will never understand them. - Me neither. - Ah, sweet mystery. (uptempo instrumental music)
