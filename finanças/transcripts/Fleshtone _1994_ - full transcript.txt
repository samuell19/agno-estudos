drawings of famous murder cases I can like the woman they called the Black Dahlia here in LA in the forties they found a body in a vacant lot cut in half through the blood drained no I just couldn't get that picture out of my mind so just doing over and over again I know you mean looks like you're repulsed but fascinated at the same time exactly I did a whole series of paintings based on photos of murder victims it's pretty weird I don't think you're weird at all I think you're romantic you know it was fantastic who must have talked for hours about everything from suicides of serial murders oh that sounds romantic you know you just don't understand what a turn-on that kind of fantasy can be no and I'm an old-fashioned guy I like women I have sex with the beams same room with this yeah

exactly what to make of it but you may be dealing with a very disturbed person who finds you with her only link with reality and the woman that she describes as her best friend he abused suicide a prostitute may very well be herself if you burst her bubble it may very well be that she's planning her own suicide I really would advise you to back off from this whole thing as soon as possible you

famous black dahlia murder case and then later on she phoned me up and she asked me to change his painting I did it Nathan look like the Dahlia cut in half was all the blood drained down later on I
