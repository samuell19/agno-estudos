- So, uh, what did, what'd you do to get in here? - Don't fuckin' talk to me. No friends where we're goin'. - Okay. ♪ Happy birthday dear Layla ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ - Hip-hip! - Hurray! - Hip-hip! - Hurray! - Hi everyone. I'm going to tell you a riddle. - Okay. - Ooh. - He hoots but has no car. - Hmm. - He flies but has no plane. - Flies but has no plane? I know, is he a slacker? - He sleeps during the day, but he's no slacker. - Oh, I don't know. What could it be? I don't know. Do you know? - What can he be? - Oh, tell us. - It's an owl! - Oh, of course it's an owl. - Now you're too good for me? If I weren't chained down, I'd cut your fuckin' face off and feed it to you. - Wow. Lucky you're chained down then, huh? - Smart ass. I will fuck your eye holes till you die and cum in your brain. - Willem Peters? Willem Peters, identify yourself. - Yeah. Yeah, it's me. What the fuck? What the fuck? Don't shoot. Don't shoot. Who are you? - I'm with the Defense Health Agency. Mr. Peters, how would you like an alternative sentence? - I shouldn't have a sentence at all. - That's not my concern. There's a rehabilitation program that requires participants that meet a laundry list of standards to qualify, and you do. - Why? What qualifications do I need? - It's kind of like a job. You'll be observing and recording your observations. - What, observing what? - I'm not a liberty to say. - Was that mean? Don't I have the right to know before I make a decision? - You forfeited those rights when you decided to be a criminal. - I'm not a criminal. - Listen, you and I both know that a man like you won't last long in prison. My asking is more of a courtesy than a requirement. Sign here. - Oh Jesus. I thought I didn't have a choice. Here. You know, leaving a paper trail's not so secretive, huh? - I'll meet you there. - How long was I out? - I'm not at liberty to say. Well, where is it, whatever it is that I'm supposed to be looking at? - It's coming. Here's where you'll be doing your observations. It's a video journal, essentially. - Well, what do I say? - Anything and everything. What you see, how you feel. You'll need to do a minimum of 10 minutes per day. - Okay. - Okay, then. - So what? Wait. - Yes. - Well, I don't know. I mean, I feel like there should be more. I don't really understand. - I told you all that I was briefed upon. - This is all so strange. - Yes. - You don't know any more? I mean, shouldn't I have some kind of a- - Listen, make no mistake, you're still a criminal. Every movement will be watched. Our system will detect even the slightest change in the environment. You just don't have to worry about being some skinhead's bottom bitch in here. Please stand to the corner. - Wait, what? Well, who even are you? - You can call me Dalesky. - What the fuck? Yeah, this is so weird. Okay. Holy shit. Fuck, what did he say? Uh, okay, well, here I am. Wherever that is, um. You think they'd be a little more formal, but, uh, I don't even know who they are. Yeah, so I'm supposed to be studying something, which makes no sense. I'm not a scientist. But maybe they want the perspective of the everyman. I'm not really that either. The room is small and cold, both literally and, and figuratively. And yeah, they clearly wanna let me know that I'm still in prison. I don't know how long I'm gonna be here. I don't really want to be here. I don't deserve to be here. I'm sick. At any rate, I'll just keep telling myself that it's, it's better than prison, right? Okay. Fuck me. No? Huh. Okay, so this is my bedroom, huh? It's not much. Holy shit we actually get cable in here. - I know why you always say you're busy when I suggest going to your apartment. - Not bad. That's not bad. - Your other women go there. Dozens of them. I won't stand for that treatment any longer, you, you- - Oh yeah, like, I'd wanna watch nothing else. Come on. Hello there. I thought that must have been you. How you doing, Layla? - Good. - Good. Do you want me to come play with you? - Yeah. - Okay. Want me to set this up? Okay. Okay. Okay. Where are we up to? Where you wanna go from? - I just. - Oh, you wrote it all on? Okay, okay. Okay, let's do that. - No. There? Good. - When did you learn all that? So still nothing to see, to observe today. So really, this journal has become my only source of entertainment for my shift, except for the, in my room, there's this old TV. It has a bunch of channels. Most of them are just fuzzy. I really only get just two of them. One's a video feed of where the, uh, wherever it is, or whatever it is, is gonna be. And the other channel only plays, constantly plays back-to-back old movies. You know, those old black and white ones where the acting's considered really good, but all the men and women just sound exactly the same? Yeah, those ones. My wife really liked those movies. She just watched 'em alone. I wasn't interested. I suspect she really like the men in those movies. You know, she had a thing for that 1940s kind of old-timey manly charm. I guess she was hoping some of it might rub off on me. You know, I'm really don't think I'm gonna like having so much time to reflect on my thoughts. Oh fuck. Oh, oh, oh. Hey, hey. No, no. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Hey man, wait. Can you tell me what's going on? Hey, no, wait! Wait, please come back. Please come, come back. Wait, hey, hey! Can you please tell me what I'm doing here? Oh, so what? No food either? Ow. Well, I'm not gonna do a fuckin' journal. Okay. - Hello? - Yeah, she's gonna love this. Okay. Hello? - Hello. - Wanna come in? - Yeah. - Okay. Come on in. - Thank you. Hmm. You play? - Oh yeah. Yeah. What do you think, huh? This is it. - Yeah. It's- - Come on now, you, remember, you surprised me by wanting to come over so quickly. I didn't have any time to prepare. - Certainly is a bachelor pad. - Oh, what? Well, it was until now. - Oh. This is weird. - Is it weird? - Hi. - Hi. - Um. How, how do you know this song? - Oh, this like one of my favorite songs. - Really? - Yeah. - Me too. - Really? - Yeah. Um, so, uh, what do all the other women think? - What other women? - Other women you had. - I mean, um, you're the first I've ever taken home. - Huh, really? - To this place, yeah, really. - Oh, right. - It's an honor, really. - Oh, wow. Thank you. - You're welcome. You can, uh, you can, you can christen it as you please. - Hmm, oh, oh, oh. - Oh, okay, a twirl. - Thank you. - Where was that twirl all afternoon? - Oh. - So, uh, do you even own a vacuum? Because context suggests that you don't. - Well, like I said, I didn't have time to prepare. You're right. I don't own one. - Well, it's big enough for a family, should the need arise. - Sure. - Okay? - Whoa, yeah. You already want to go ahead and bring up the C-bomb, huh? - I didn't say anything about my cunt. - Heh, no, no, no. No, children. - Oh, I don't consider a children a four-letter word. - Well, sure, but kids is. Try the K-word then. - You want kids, right? You said you did. - Yeah, sure, Carrie, but can we not talk about it right now? - Why not? On our first date, you said you eventually wanted to start a family. - Yeah, sure, but can we not talk about it right now please? - Look, if I'm wasting my time with you, I'd like to know now. Can you turn that thing off, please? - Oh, fuck me. This is bullshit. Fuckin' why am I here observing in that there's nothing to fucking see? Why am I here observing? There's nothing to see. Ooh man, I'll bet prison's bad, but I'm gonna bet that it's not nearly as boring. At least they get to walk around and interact with other people. Walk around on a leash or whatever. I can't even see the sun. Trying to communicate yesterday with whoever it is that throws the food under my door. They didn't answer me or give me any food. And by food, you know what I mean, right? I mean an egg. I got a fuckin' egg once a day. Maybe twice a day. I don't know, that's the thing, I fuckin' lost track. Time's already so blended I couldn't tell you when that happened. I'm not sure if anyone watches these as I update 'em. You watching this? Okay. If so, hey, hey. Hey, scientists, military, cops. Wherever the fuck you are, the government? I don't know, Area 51? Wherever this is fuckin' beaming into, what the fuck am I doing here? - You have 10 seconds to move to the corner. - Hello. - Hi. What are you doing here? - Slow your approach. Okay. - How's your adjustment? - Yeah, I'm feeling a little better every day, but man, it's boring in here. - Well, prison. - So where is it? - It's coming. - Yeah, but when? - It's coming, I'm going to take your heart rate and ask you a few questions. Sit. - Was there any reason I should have or expect to have an unusual heart rate? Okay. - I'm going to ask a few questions and I need you to answer as quick as possible. No hesitation. First thing that comes to mind. - Sure. Kind of like word association. - No. If you don't answer in an adequate amount of time, you'll get a little shock. - Little sh- - Oh! Fuck that hurts! - You can't wait. Are you ready? - I guess. - What is your name? - Willem Peters. - Are you an American citizen? - Yes, I am. - Are you married? - Fuck, I don't know how to answer that question. - Answer it. Are you married? - Yes. I guess. - Do you have children? - Yes. - What is your favorite animal? - I don't know. - Favorite animal? - An owl. - Why is an owl your favorite animal? - It's not. I don't have one. It's just what came to mind. - Out of all the animals, why an owl? - Layla liked owls. - Why did she like owls? - I don't know. I never asked her. She probably thought they were cute. - I need to know. Why didn't you ever ask? - Well, what has this got to do with anything? - Okay, then. That's enough for today. - What? No, no, no, no. Wait a minute. What's going on? I've been here for like five days. - Please stand to the corner of the room. - You know, this whole shtick with you not answering any of my questions, it's getting pretty old. Why am I here, man? There's nothing here. - Until next time. - Oh, fuckin' hell. Oh. What was that? There's something in there. It's in the corner. He must have showed up in the night sometime when I was sleeping. It looks like someone who's, who's sick. Oh, at least there's something in there now, right? - Oh, the wrecker of my home. Are you mad? Yes. Good and mad. You get that way when somebody steals your wife. - Now, Marcel, whatever you think, you are mistaken. - Yeah, that sounds familiar. A typical wifely remark. - Oh, you beast, you! - Oh, now, no excitement. - What's the idea. - I love you. - He hasn't moved really from that back corner. Well, now he's starting to kinda make these small adjustments, sort of moves like he's trying to get comfortable or something. I assume he's fed in a similar fashion to me with food, just kinda pushed down at the door every couple hours, but I haven't seen it, haven't seen any of that. Yeah. Yeah. He doesn't seem to be giving off much heat. Like he's barely alive. Fuck me! - Hi everyone. It's Zoe. I am at the park with my family 'cause you know, there's nowhere else a single 17-year-old would rather be. So there's dad and Layla at the closest we have to a beach. And there is my mom looking absolutely stunning. But my God, why do you torture yourself with that shit? - It keeps me sharp. Maybe you should try some. - Sudoku is like the worst thing to come outta Japan since used panty vending machine, so. - What are you talking about? - Yeah, it's a thing. They have vending machines that literally like turn them out. - Hey, could you just keep an eye on your sister for a sec? I just, I gotta go. - Go where? - Bathroom. - Yeah, okay. Sure. - Oh, what the fuck? What the fuck? What the fuck, what? How can he see me? He's like, he's aware of wherever I am in fucking the room. Unless, unless this isn't a two-way mirror. This is just a sheet of tinted glass. Maybe they want him to see me. - What are you doing here? You promised not to follow me. - I told you, I cannot live without you. - You want me to call my husband? No, it is you I want. - Oh, go away. You are mad. - Yes, I am mad! - Hold on. How did you know? - It doesn't matter. I fell asleep while he was dressing. - Yes. - That's one method. Personally, I used to read a good book. - Frozen. - Frozen. - I'm out of cleansing cream. - Now, don't get me nervous again, Don. Your secretary must have ample. - What, now? - Oh! - Hey, what are you looking at? - Do you have to film this, huh? Or are you a teenager too? - Oh, come on. Why not? I'm still here, you know? - Okay. Gimme this. How do you like it? Huh? How do you like being watched? - Stop being so dramatic. - Can I please have the camera? - Sure sweetie. Here you go. - Oh, oh. - Sing a song. Okay. Which one? "Blue Baby". ♪ Blue baby, you've been walking around lately ♪ ♪ With a frown across your brow ♪ ♪ Blue baby, you think it's cold and rainy ♪ ♪ Never see you look so down ♪ ♪ Don't cry, don't be sad ♪ ♪ 'Cause I love you more than you know ♪ ♪ You're my crazy baby ♪ ♪ You're mine ♪ - Yay! - I don't know how, but I slept almost 18 hours yesterday and I'm still exhausted. I had another dream about Carrie and Layla in the park last night. Carrie looked beautiful. Fuck, she was beautiful. I didn't love her. I loved her girls, but not her. I definitely thought she was a great person, especially a great mom. But I don't know if she loved me. I think we were just together for our kids, yeah. But she's gone now, so that doesn't even matter. I was all the girls had. Fuck, maybe this is it. Maybe it's just a test, you know, just to see if, if we can coexist. You know, you started love, you become a family. And then what? You know, I heard this thing about this experiment that they did with a bunch of lab rats where they, they put 'em in this cage and they had two bottles of water in there, and one of 'em was just water, but the other one was like laced with drugs of some kind. And they found that they put a rat in the cage by itself and gradually the rat would start to, start to drink from the drug water. Like every time. And then gradually, it'd become addicted and it'd OD and it'd die, every time. But the rat that they put into the cage that had a bunch of other rats and toys and enough food, it never went for the drug water, it never needed to. You know, it was happy. It had all the other rats. It's crazy, but whenever I look up and, and I see him looking at me, I wonder how he feels. I don't know. Maybe I need to just embrace it, you know? We're both in the same situation. God. Fuck. I know. Maybe I'm just going crazy. - You have 10 seconds to move to the corner. - Oh shit. Okay, okay, okay. - Hello again. - So what are you doing here? 20 questions again, huh? So you're gonna tell me what the hell is up with him? Hey, can he see me? - Are you ready? - Yeah. - What is your name? - Willem Peters. - Do you have children? - Yeah. - Last time when I asked if you were married, you hesitated. Why? - Well, I don't know if you can be married to a dead person. - Are you of sound mind? - What? - Are you of sound mind? - Like do I think I'm normal? - Yes. - At this moment? Yes. - Why did you qualify your last respond with at this moment? - Because I think this place will make me crazy. - Why do you think this place will make you crazy? - Because he was always watching me. - Who is he? - Him! - Why did you refer to the subject as him? - Ow, fuck! - Why do you refer to the subject as him? - What, is he a lady? - Does referring to the subject as him make you feel closer to the subject? - What do you mean by closer? - Do you identify with the subject in any way? - Yes. - What ways? - We're both in prison. - Do you feel the subject doesn't belong here? - I don't belong here. - That's not my question. - Well, I don't know anything about him! So how can I answer that? - How is your relationship with your children? - Fine. - But you couldn't tell me why your youngest chose her favorite animal. - Yeah, maybe our relationship could have been better. - How could have your relationship been better? - Fuck. - How could've your relationship have been better? - No parent has a perfect relationship with their kids. - How is your relationship imperfect? - No, no, no. I don't wanna talk about that. - How is your relationship imperfect? How is your relationship imperfect? - Oh fuck. - We are at 10% capacity here, Willem. Now is not the time to play games. - What the fuck is this? What the does this have to do with what is happening here? - What is happening here? - I don't know. Look at him. Are you gaslighting me? - What do you mean by gaslight? - You're leading me to a predetermined conclusion. You're trying to make me say something. You want me to say something. - What do you think I want you to say? - You already know. - That's enough for today. - Oh, please, please don't. Can you tell me what, can he see me? Can he see me? Tell me that. Please. You gotta tell me something. - I'm not at liberty to say. Please stand to the corner of the room. - You got me? Yeah. How about now? Hey, where have you been? I missed you. Did you miss me? You know I can break you, right? You know, it's only the food that comes out in my door every day that saves you. All you guys, you and all your friends, you'd be fucked. Just pull you straight off there and break you. Whoa. Whoa, shit. Huh? Oh, don't wear out your shit, man. Don't fuck your rubber bands, wherever they are. Hey! Too slow. Oh, gimme eight, gimme eight, gimme eight. Gimme eight. Get up, fuck. Get up, get up. Shit. You know, I almost, I almost felt a sense of compassion from him. Like he wanted to comfort me. I wonder if he has a family. If he ever thinks about his life before he was brought here, captured here. Man, at least I have something to do. You know, I've got the old movies. I've got these journal observation. He's got none of that. Man, when I get outta here, what am I gonna even do? You know, get a job, or maybe I'll just live by myself. Just live quiet, you know, just simple. I don't know. I just don't know. I could try and make things right with Zoe. Should I be scared of you? Hey. - Hey. - Can you keep an eye on her? - Sure. - Come on, baby girl. Here you go. - Where are you going? - What, he's gonna make a phone call. I'll be like two minutes. - Okay. So we, just turn that thing off please. Can you please? Thank, thank you. - I know you know what he's doing. - Just don't. I'm done hearing about it. - You're done hearing about it? Maybe it's time to do something. - I've tried everything. What else can I do? - He's hurting himself. What are we gonna do when you're... - When I'm what? Dead? - I mean, yes. What are we gonna do? - I'm tired, Zoe. I don't know what I can do. I don't know. I don't know how to explain what it's like to just wake up and have no energy. Like every morning something is sucking the energy out of me, like I, like I didn't sleep at all. He'll step up. He always does. - He won't, mom. He's never been a dad to me. He can't have sole custody of her, when he's doing. I don't even know why you're still with him. - Stop it. Zoe, that's enough. I mean, why are you? - Mom? Mom? Mom? - Mom! Dad, come here now! - Fucking all of 'em! Ah! Next time you come through there, you fuck. No one has come in for him. No one, not once, no food. Nobody has done anything for him. He's sick. What are you doing? Huh? You just experimented on him and now you're just gonna wait and see how long it takes for him to die? Fuck, man. A regular person would've died by now. Probably a long time ago. I mean, how, it's already been like... What? - Fuck, no, no, no, no, no, no. This can't be. This has been a mistake. This looks like I've been here for the, for at least... Oh my. No way. Wait, wait, wait. No, no. No, this, this, there's no way. I've just made up too many marks on a bunch of days, or I've been so sleepy that I haven't, I haven't clocked that I've marked a particular day. That's what that is. That's what's happening there. That's what's happening there. Fuck. Why man? Why? Huh? Why? Why me? Why would you take a prisoner out of his sentence? Huh? What's in that for you? Just that make, I'm somehow like in, like disposable. Am I fucking disposable? Huh? Me, me! Am I disposable? Yeah. Yeah. Huh? Yeah. Oh fuck. Without a doubt, he's watching me. Yeah. Maybe even down the camera feed, huh? Yeah. Yeah. I don't know how, but now I can feel it. Like I can, I can fucking physically feel it. What? Huh? What? What do you want? Ah? What the fuck are you looking at!? Oh. - Mom, mom. Mom! Dad! - Whoa. What happened? - Just call an ambulance. - Uh, yeah. Yeah, I got it. Wait, wait. So there's your phone, there's your phone. - You calling? - Yeah, yeah. - Mom, mom, mom. - Yeah, hi, uh, it's my wife. She's uh... Eating her purse. - She's having a fucking seizure, dad! - We're in a park. - Mommy, mommy. Which park? Zoe, which park? - Hi. - Yeah, please hurry. - Mommy. - What's that in her mouth for? Get that out of her mouth! - Fucking stop, dad! Don't touch her! - It's okay, come here, it's okay. ♪ Blue baby ♪ ♪ Blue baby, how you feeling lately ♪ ♪ With a frown you look so down ♪ ♪ Don't sigh, don't look so glum ♪ ♪ 'Cause I love you more than I show ♪ ♪ Now my blue baby ♪ - Hey, Boxhead. Come here. Come here, come here, come here. Tell me he's not fuckin' looking straight at me. Come here. Did he go in here? Okay. Fuck, got this straight. I know what's going on. You fucking come into my room again, even in my fuckin' dreams. Be fuckin' ready for you next time. - Layla, no, no, no. Don't come in here right now, sweetie. - Daddy. - What did I just fuckin' say? Get out. - Hey, what are you doing? Okay, just go in here. What are you doing? Are you high again? - Oh fuck, it's just a little just to, just to take the edge off. - Take what edge? The being sober edge or being a shit father edge? You need to look after her. - I am. - I walk in and she's crying all by herself. That is not looking after her. - Well, what do you care? - That's it. - Zoe. What? - Where is it? - No, no. - Where is it? - Zoe. Zoe, no, no. Zoe, no. Come on. Ugh. No, no, no, no, Zoe. Zoe! - I need you to go to your room. Okay? - But I- - Just go now. We can go to. All right, just go right now, okay? - Zoe! Hey, Zoe! Why? It was in my room last night. It wasn't a dream, it was just no dream, I know it. Last time I felt this helpless... Why am I here? Why are you showing me videos of my life? Why are you showing me my, my empty apartment? Dalesky! Dalesky, get me the fuck outta here. I'm out! I'm out, I wanna go back to prison. I don't know how, but I think, I think it's feeding off of me. I don't know how, like how a plant feeds off sunshine, but it's absorbing me. Fuck, something's wrong. It's in my head. It's in fucking my dreams. Get me out of here. Dalesky! Dalesky! Hey! Oh fuck. Oh! - You have 10 seconds to move to the corner. - Stay down. Come to the table. I'm gonna take a mouth swab. Open. - It was real, wasn't it? Is that why you're wearing all this? Is it because it touched me? - I'm going to ask you a few questions. - Oh really? Now? - You know the drill. What is your name? - Willem. - What is your full name? - Willem Peters. - Are you married? - I don't know. - Are you of sound mind? - I don't know. - Are you a liar? - No. - Have you ever lied in your life? - Yes. - Does that not make you a liar? - That makes everyone a liar. - Have you ever lied in our previous sessions? - No. - Do you believe in God? - No. - Why don't you believe in God? - Because God wouldn't be letting this happen to me. - What's happened to you? - I... I don't know. - Are you a liar? - No. - Are you of sound mind? - I don't know. Yes. - Then how can you not tell me what's happened to you? - Because I don't believe it. - What's happened that you don't believe? - It came into my room. - How could that happen? - I don't fucking know! - Are you a liar? - Not more than anyone else. - Are you of sound mind? - I don't know. - What do you fear most? - Bill. - Bill Peters, your father? - My dad. Yes! - William Peters, also known as Bill, died at the age 56, school bus driver. Do you see yourself in your parents? Do you see yourself in your parents? - I am as different as can be from that piece of shit. - Are you of sound mind? - I don't know. - Are you a liar? - No more than anyone else. - When you tell me that subject left its cell, went into your room and then went back into its cell, how come subject is not what you fear the most? It's important that you answer my question. How come you fear a dead man more than the subject who, according to you, left its room and went into yours? - I don't know. - Are you a liar? - I can be. Anyone can be. - How is the relationship with your own father similar to that of your children? - No, no, no! You're leading me down that determined path again. - You need to address certain things in your past. I'm guiding you down a road that you built. Whether you like it or not is not the point. Do you believe you have free will? - What's the point of this, huh, torture? - Do you believe you have free will? - I don't know. Dalesky, please stop, please. Please stop. - That's it for today. Move to the corner of the room. Oh, please don't leave me here with this thing. - I'm sorry. - Oh, please, please! - I really am. - Dalesky, no, Dalesky! Please, please. You know that daddy loves you. I just wanna show you how much you mean to me. You know that daddy loves you. Zoe! Hey! Zoey! Oh. Fuck no. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Shit. - You need to quit. Mom isn't around anymore and you need to be an adult. - That was a lot of fucking money you just wasted. - I'm taking Layla and I'm going to the police. - No, you're not. You're too young. I can have the police arrest you for kidnapping. - Well, she can't be here with you. - Oh, fuck it. Hey! - Come on. Get out of here. Get under there. - Hey, hey honey. Hey, hey, hey. - Give her to me. - No, she's my daughter. - You're hurting her! - That's 'cause you're scaring her! Leave. - Layla, I'm coming back for you. Okay? I can't leave her here with you. I'm coming back with the police. - Get out. - I have everything on camera, dad. - Get out. Leave! Go, go! Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. No, no, this is not happening. - Police. Open up! This is the police. Come out slowly with your hands above your head. - Oh fuck. - Willem? - Come here. Come here. - Daddy, my owl. - I need you to hide. Oh fuck, okay, here. Here's your fucking owl, okay? I need you to hide in the closet, but don't come out. - He hoots but he's no car. - What? - He flies but he's no plane. - What? Okay baby, please, please, just keep real quiet. - Willem. Willem, we know you're in there. - God, no! What did you just fucking give me? What am I supposed to be doing? No! as you please. - Oh, well. - Twirl. Where was that twirl all afternoon? - Hi everyone, it's Zoe. I am at the park with my family 'cause you know there's nowhere else a single 17-year-old would rather be. So there's dad and Layla at the closest we have to a beach. - Every night the darkness seeps through my walls over and over and over and over.
