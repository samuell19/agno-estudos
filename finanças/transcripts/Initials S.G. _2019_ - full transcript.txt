This is a story about a man who lives his life in the background. But, despite this... he will never be forgotten. Cut! Sorry! I'm sorry, my bad. I think a fish swam up against my face, and it freaked me out a little. Let's do it again. Listen, you gotta be really still, otherwise the shot is useless, okay? Back to one, we're going again, quickly! -Nico! -How was it? A little cold, but okay. Cool... Hey... and the assistant who brought me to the set? Nina, or something. Tattoos, pink hair... She's 23... -23 years old. -What's that got to do with anything? So? Are you still doing porn? Every now and then, trying to get more acting-acting work though... Lemme buy you a beer. Brazil-Germany just started. Are you gonna go watch? -Wait, you don't know yet? -Know what? Germany already scored four! Shut the fuck up. It's like twenty minutes in. I'm serious! Check it on your phone. The game would go down as one of the most brutal beatings in World Cup history. Germany completely dismantled Brazil... scoring five goals in the first half... Each one easier and more shocking than the one before it. And, as lifelong rival footballing countries... the Argentines basked in the glory of the Brazilian defeat. But deep down, even though they didn't want to admit it... they were simply trying to distract themselves from their fear over Argentina's game the next day, in their own quest to reach the final. And they had to win. INCIALES Sergio Garces... How are you feeling? Fine... A little woozy. That's from the pain medication. You should get used to it. I'm just going to check on this cut. Don't move. It's really stuck... OK... It looks like it stopped bleeding. I'll have them come put a fresh bandage on you. How's your head? Do you remember what happened? Yeah. I was riding my bike and some idiot who wasn't paying attention... opened their door right in front of me. How long do you think I'm gonna look like this? Dunno, probably a few weeks. A few weeks? Shit. -Can I do anything to speed it up? -No, not really. -Are you sure? -No, I'm sorry. -I'm an actor, this isn't very good. -An actor, huh? Have you been in anything I might have seen? Well, I dunno. Maybe. I've had a lot of small roles in a lot of movies. A helmet! That's what you should've been wearing. It could've been much worse, you're very lucky. Sergio loved to fantasize about the pain and misfortune of the people he hated. At the moment... he was thinking about the person who opened the car door in his face. And how he hoped they got it worse than him. Maybe some broken bones... Maybe a concussion... So he would've hated to know that he was the only one that got hurt. And that the car wasn't even damaged. He truly got the worst of it. You piece of shit... Fuck... I can't believe it. Hello? -Hey, Sergio. How are you? -Good. I can't talk much, I'm driving right now. I'm calling about the appointment at the courthouse tomorrow at 11am. Fuck, it's tomorrow? Yes. Sorry, I forgot to call you earlier. Can you make it? -Yeah, sure... -Great, bye! Excuse me, your Honor. I think I know... what that paper is saying. But the police report is wrong, because I didn't throw that guy through the window. I mean, we were both fighting, and it kind of just happened. And besides, he tried to steal my friend's purse. I mean... So I did... what any citizen... What any citizen would do. And my face is like this from a bicycle accident yesterday... not from fighting or anything like that... Besides... Mr. Garces... You'll be on probation for six months, and you'll pay a $1000 fine. Stay out of trouble, and this will go off your record. I'm also requiring that you go to anger management counseling. The court will set it up for you. You must attend, or we'll meet again, and you go to jail. Do you get it? Yes. I get it. So wait, how many films in the festival are you in? Something like 16. But I have visible screen time only in eight. Sixteen? Yeah, but visible screen time only in eight. -All of them as an extra? -As a featured extra. What are you laughing about? -That might be a record. -It might. I'm gonna ask someone in the office to find out. Nice. Record breaking! So I'll hit the spa, and then head to the bar for the game. -What time you going? -No, I can't come until the 2nd half. I got stuck doing like three Q&A's I have to moderate... No. What the fuck! You're going to jinx us! Pancho! Jane is a film distributor, here from the States. Yeah, 16... 16? Visible screen time in eight, as an extra. -Featured extra. -Might be a record. They're checking. -That's true. -Wow, impressive. Wanna smoke? If you think that long about anything, you kinda have to do it. I want to, but I have a meeting, so... OK. In that case, it's either a great idea, or a horrible one. -Well, it's here if you want it. -Thanks. So are you guys watching the game later? It's a pretty big deal, huh? God, I'm so fucking nervous I think I'm gonna throw up. Yeah, sure. It's really close to here. You guys wanna get a drink? Actually I was gonna go to a spa. That sounds nice! My hotel... An amazing spa. -You're at the Intercontinental? -Yeah. Yeah, I heard about the spa there. Fede said it was insane. Yeah, let's all go there! Sure, why not? Yes? Smoke a little bit. -That's what I like to hear. -Thanks. My god! Impressive! Sorry, are you asking me? I do that sometimes. Congratulations. I'm sure you get a kick out of my shitty accent. "Argentines" No, not at all. I like your accent. It's very... 'Without breath', the Godard film. With Belmondo. "Breathless" Exactly. Did you see him? Sauna honey. I'll come in a bit. I still have some toxins to sweat out. OK. Sergio knew this type of woman all too well. In town on business, dying to start a romance with a local. But right now, he just wanted to be alone. He needed to focus on the game. And although Sergio had never told anyone, ever since he was a kid, he was convinced that he and the Argentina National team were somehow connected. When the team wins, Sergio believes that things go well for him. And when they lose, he does too. Argentina hadn't made it to a World Cup Final for 24 years. Twenty-four years waiting for another chance to win it all. And now, after an entire game of missed opportunities and overall poor play... They all had to wait a little longer. The game would be decided by penalty kicks. A brutal experience for any emotional spectator. "Holland is up first." "2, 1... here it goes..." "He blocked it!" "Let's go Argentina!" "Up next is Rodriguez for the 4th penalty." "If Argentina scores, they win the game." Yeah man, fuck her for Argentina! Lead the way. Hello? What's up man? I'm with the crew at that same bar from yesterday... I thought you'd like to know that your pink hair Nina is here... She's looking very single and sexy in her Messi jersey. And she asked about you. Oh shit, really? -Tic toc, man. Get your ass down here. -Thanks, man. I owe you one. You're gonna owe me a lot more if this pans out. For sure. See you. Everything okay? Yeah, I just got a last minute shoot tomorrow, super early. I gotta be there at 5 a.m. It sucks. Someone dropped out, so they called me. -What happened to your face? -Oh, man... I had an accident yesterday, with my bike. -Are you okay? -Yeah, you should see the bike. Nina? I forgot to text you. Some dude showed up, I think it was her boyfriend, and they left. You're a fucking asshole! Are you serious? -My bad, man. Lemme buy you a beer. -Make it a Scotch. Double. Neat. You got it. Waiter! Fuck me... Frenchie! Holy fuck, they told me about your face, but in person, dude.... It's worse... It's good to see you too. Man, I was hoping to get laid tonight but all these chicks are either with someone, or fucking ugly... Speaking of fucking, I need some work. Get me something. Get it yourself. Your face is a mess, what do you want me to do? Come on, man. Don't be like that. I dunno, some voice-over thing. Or that fake agent shit where you blur my face out. I've never asked you for shit. You wouldn't have a job if it wasn't for me. Even if I could, we don't even do the fake agent stuff any more. Wait, you know what? We've got a virtual reality thing and the guy they wanna use is a asshole. Please, hook me up. Look, I can't promise anything. I'll see what I can do. Cool... I'm gonna take off, this place is a freak show. I'm in my car, anyone need a ride? No, I'll walk, smoke a joint, look at the world. It's all good. Whiskey. Double. Neat. -I said Scotch. -I know. I asked for whiskey. Cheers. "I drink..." "In too strong a dose" "I see..." "Pink elephants" "And spiders on the shirt" "Of my tuxedo" "Bats on the ceiling" "In the living room" Because Argentina had a hard time against Holland... Even though they won the game, they weren't where they should be as a team... What is it? Don't you see it? It's coming. I don't see anything. Are you tripping? What's going on? I think he's tripping. Hello? Hi, I have an appointment with the psychologist. Which one? I dunno, the psychologist. We have more than one here. I don't know, I didn't make the appointment myself. -What's your name, sir? -Sergio Garces. You're here for Doctor Molina? Sure, yeah. I'm sorry, he left for the day. What do you mean he left? I have an appointment with him. Well, you didn't come on time. Something personal came up for him. So... What? I said you didn't come on time, and he had... I heard you, but what the fuck's going on? I'm not even ten minutes late. Your appointment was at 11, and it's 11:10 now. According to my watch, it's 11:07. Well, ours says 11:10, and we asked you to be here 15 minutes early. So that's almost 30 minutes late. No listen, no one told me to be 15 minutes early. It's on our website, sir. I didn't go to your fucking website, this appointment was made for me! Sir, please calm down, Dr. Molina isn't in. There is nothing I can do. You're going to have to schedule a new appointment. No, I can't believe this is happening to me. Listen... It took me over an hour to get over here. I'm here. Can't I just see someone else? I'm sorry sir, it doesn't work that way. Would you like the phone number, so you make another appointment? Or you can go to our website... I'm not going to your fucking website! Stop talking about the fucking website! And I don't want the fucking number! What I want is to see someone right now, goddammit! I came all the way here, I'm here now. So call him and tell him to come back because I'm only eight minutes late! I'm staying right fucking here, you hear me? Sir, I need you to leave, or I'm calling the police. I'm calling the cops. Frenchie, there's a shoot tomorrow. You'll have to wear a helmet with a camera. It's at noon, you free? Yes, I'm free. Thanks man. I'll see you tomorrow. Bye. Can you stop? The thing with your hand? This wasn't the first time Sergio followed someone who pissed him off. He once followed a guy who cut in front of him in line at the supermarket, And he threw a brick through his car window. He loved the way tailing someone made him feel. Like some kind of detective... Or even a spy. He was going to make sure this woman never pissed off anyone else again. But then he remembered... He was on probation. Frenchie! What's up? -Good. -Yeah? I have some coke! -What? -I have some coke! -You have coke? -Yes. Let's go. So? Did you fuck Jane the other night? Nah, I kinda dropped the ball on that. We were making out near her hotel, and Nico called me about a really hot PA from his set. Which one? -Nina. -The one with the tattoos? -Right. -She's really hot. Yeah. We were kind of flirting the other day on set. So... Nico calls saying he's with her, and that she asked about me. I went crazy, so I bailed. Nice, so? -When I got there she had already left. -That sucks! No shit. I was so fucking pissed. Well, she'll probably be here. -Who, Nina? -No, Jane. Anyway... She's not my type. Really. Just a sec! -Hi there. -Hi! -How are you? -Great! And you? Good, good. Fantastic. Be right back! I didn't know I was still here? No, that you were still here. You're here! I'm here, yes. Sadly. Sergio always had a hard time falling asleep next to women... that he slept with. It was strange. But it was true. He had never thought about it much. And I guess if you asked him he probably wouldn't even know what you were talking about. He liked to think of himself as a ladies man, as a lover. But the truth is he had never, not even once, been in love. He was a liar. And the biggest lies he ever told anyone were to himself. All of this was something he might tell his therapist. And his therapist might say... That it all stemmed from an insecurity of sorts. An inability to be at ease with the idea that he could be right for anyone. Or that anyone could be right for him. But he didn't have a therapist. He didn't believe in that type of thing. He believed you're supposed to bury your problems, deep down. Until one day, they bury you. Hello. Hello. I have to go. Do you wanna have sex before you go? Well if you're late already... But... Maybe later? Let me know if it's uncomfortable. -No, it's fine. -Yeah? Alright, you have to understand that what you see is what we'll see. Don't lift your head up, or turn to the side, or look up or nothing. You just gotta stare at the subject. Sounds easy, I just stare at the subject. Okay, let's go. Everyone ready? Yes, recording! Okay, let's try it. Look over here. Fleshdance, Scene #69, Take 1. Rolling and action! Alright, I'm finished here. No! You missed a spot! But I already did that one... No, here... What are you doing? Sergio, take off her clothes and start fucking her. -Hey, stop... -Hey man... What the hell is going on? What the fuck motherfucker?! What the hell? Are you fucking dying? No, I think it's a blood clot! Goddammit! Sergio, you missed your appointment? You're in big trouble. Call me. Shit! There's nothing there, dickhead. Get off the street! -Hey... -Hello. One Jim Beam please? -We ran out. -What do you mean? I have only Breeder's. Alright, give me that. How much? $1.50 -Hey, man! -Dude, tell me it isn't true? Don't even start. It's not funny at all. Do you hear me laughing? I vouched for you! I'm getting a lot of shit from a guy named Tracy, okay? Yeah, well I'm getting a lot of shit from a guy named Basta, so... No, no... You don't get it! You bled all over Courtney Andrews! You realize you fucked up big time, don't you? Man, fuck all that! He couldn't believe what was happening. How did things come to this point? Where did it all go wrong? He couldn't believe it had been 20 years since he'd gained fame in the porn scene. "Terminator" they called him, because of how he just killed pussy. I don't have AIDS, asshole! But that was a different time. Now all that was gone. Now he was out of work, and out of luck. Now, he was just a middle aged guy in Buenos Aires who wanted to be an actor. And all he had was a blood clot in his nose. Hold it! What floor? Third. What happened? I dunno, man. I'm in here just like you. Holy shit man, are we stuck? What the fuck? I don't know if I can handle this. Look, calm down. Chill. This elevator does this sometimes. Relax, it'll start up again. What if it doesn't? We're going to die in here. I'm claustrophobic, man. -Calm down. -I can't do this... Help! Someone help! Yo, man, chill the fuck out. What the fuck is wrong with you? Shut the fuck up, will you? So we can see if someone comes and we can call them. What the fuck else is going to happen today? Help! Somebody help! Calm down! Don't touch me, motherfucker. I'll kill you! Calm down! Let go of me... No... I say let's go and it means let's go... No, no, no... it's not like that. I just came to... say hi. The front door was open, but... Give me a hand please, for a second. Listen to me... It's hard to explain, but I just need your help, okay? Jane, please, help me! Jane! Please! Thanks... The elevator door! Fuck... Wait here! Be right back! He attacked me. The elevator got stuck with us inside. I don't know if he was high or something... But it was either me or him. Do you believe me? Is he dead? I don't know. I started... choking him. Until he passed out. His pulse... I've never checked a pulse before. I mean, I don't feel anything. But I might be doing it wrong. What are you doing? If he's dead, he won't feel a thing. I need a cigarette. Is that yours? Yours? No. I don't have that ringtone. Shit. Fuck, he's a drug dealer. It's dangerous. They'll never believe me. It's a long story. Trust me. We just need to get out of this area. We ditch the phone and then it's not our problem anymore. What are you talking about? No! I watch a lot of TV, Law & Order and stuff... Well, those shows are about cops and lawyers. If they didn't solve the crimes, or win cases, there would be no show. It has to be that way. Law & Disorder. Exactly, yeah. I know... Let's get a taxi. We go to my friend's house, we'll need a car and we can borrow his. And we could leave the phone in the taxi. I don't know... I'm not so sure, this is all... No, you're in this now. Like it or not, you're in it. You realize that? And now we have to find a way to get through this together. I'm sorry if you're uncomfortable, but it happened and you're here now. I mean, pray. Write something, sing a song. Do whatever it takes to get over it, but you can't leave me alone. It's just you and me now. No one else. I need you with me. Because in this World Cup Final, many do not have faith in the National team... Don't be nervous. It's going to be fine. Excuse me? The game. Argentina is going to win. They have to. Yeah. Let's hope so. But of the four Finals they've played, they've only won two... And in the other two they weren't so fortunate. We will see what kind of luck this National team has as the country remains paralyzed... Waiting nervously for this game, again against Germany... For the third time, another Final against the difficult German team. I got us something to eat. I'm not hungry, but I thought we should eat something. My friend's on his way with the keys. What a shit show. Thirty years I've waited for this game... This game. Be right back. Some would say that Argentina played their best game against Germany. That after forcing the game into extra time, almost reaching penalty shots, they deserved to win. But in the end... Germany found its victory goal. A marvelous Andre Shürrle cross that sailed so gracefully onto the chest, and then to the foot of Mario Götze in the 113th minute. Sergio felt guilty. He didn't wear his jersey... And he didn't go to the bar to watch the game. It was all his fault. Can you check who it is? The light blinds me when I drive at night. It's Pancho. What's he saying? Frenchie... I hope you're happy with yourself for jinxing the team. Where the fuck are you? Come buy us all beers. Asshole. You want me to answer him? Sure, why not? You can tell him that I killed a guy in an elevator and we're on our way to bury his body in a borrowed car. No, I was just kidding. Why 'Frenchie'? A while back... I kinda had a singing career. And I recorded an album of Serge Gainsbourg covers in Spanish. They started calling me that because they said that I wanted to be French. That's so cool. I love Serge Gainsbourg. Who doesn't? Yeah. It's there in the music thing... "Initials S.G." That's the one, yeah. Listen to the organ It plays for you That tune is terrible I hope you like it... It's quite beautiful, isn't it? It's the requiem For a moron I composed it especially for you In your sordid memory It's a pretty theme Don't you find the resemblance to yourself? Poor moron Here's the organ starting again You must learn that tune by heart So that you don't even hesitate On the requiem for a moron What's that face for? Don't you appreciate it? What is it exactly that you don't like? - Do you need help? - No. I'll do it. Yeah... This hole is also going to leave a mark. Wait... What? Are you serious? Another sleepless night next to a sleeping woman. Of course, this time it was for different reasons. In any case, he was still amazed that Jane stuck around. That she was willing to help him clean up his mess. But what he would never know was that she never truly intended to leave. The truth was that she had been waiting her whole life for a thrill like this. She had always romanticized the idea of a criminal couple. And she longed for that type of connection with someone. They say "misery loves company." But apparently, so does murder. -Hello. -Hi. Sorry to bother you. My name is Olga, I live with my boyfriend in 3C. We moved in recently, but... I'm really worried, I haven't seen him since yesterday morning. So I'm going around asking everyone in the building if they've seen him. His name is Samuel. Maybe... With this photo, you can tell if you've seen him. He hangs outside a lot. Maybe you ran into him yesterday? No... You sure? Take a look. No. I mean, his face looks familiar, but I'm sure I didn't see him yesterday. - Okay. - Sorry. It's okay... If you see him, please, like I said, I'm in 3C. You can just knock. Anytime, day or night. Okay, I will. Okay, I really appreciate it. For your time. I'm really sorry. It must be horrible. Thank you. -Nausea? -No... - Dizziness? - No. When you close your eyes, do you get dizzy? - No. - Okay. You're gonna be fine, you just need to get some rest. As for what was inside your nose, don't freak out, okay? It's going to sound a little strange, but... It was a leech. What do you mean a leech? A big one too. About... three inches. But, tell me... Have you been swimming lately, in any lakes or rivers? No. I don't think so. Yeah, I was in the river for a movie last week. That must be it then. It's actually not that uncommon. But it's out now, and everything looks normal. You'll take some antibiotics, in case there's any infection, but you're gonna be just fine. So we're almost done, only a couple more awards to go. But before that, we have a special award... Something we've never done before, but that we're really excited to do. In the film industry, and in festivals, extras are often overlooked... We know they're there and that's it. But the truth is that without them, without their passion for cinema... Our films would ultimately suffer. Or perhaps they wouldn't even get made. That's why when we found out that here, this year in our festival... there was an actor involved in 16 of the films exhibited this year we decided to do something. It gives me great pleasure to present this special acting award to my good friend, Sergio Garces. Let's hear it for him! Come on, Sergio! Thank you... Really, thank you. I wasn't expecting this. I want to... Sorry... Are you okay? A big round of applause for Sergio Garces! I saw him. He was there. Who? The guy... I saw him. Sitting there. I don't know if I can do that. I'm gonna lose it... Happy birthday to you... What time is your flight tomorrow? I gotta be at the airport in... Five hours. I hate morning flights. They're the worst. Look at that... You are the morning, I am the night. And what are your plans when you get back to New York? What about you? Well... Back to New York again. So... I don't think that's a good idea. I admit I went through hell for you, my love That time the wind took away... my love Whether it pleases you or not We dance the Javanaise We loved each other The length of one song In your opinion, what have we seen of love? Between us you had me fooled, my love Whether it pleases you or not We dance the Javanaise We loved each other The length of one song Without reason, Spring is dedicated to love I wanted to see that love in you, my love Whether it pleases you or not We dance the Javanaise We loved each other The length of one song Life is not worth living without love But you're the one who wanted it that way, my love Whether it pleases you or not We dance the Javanaise We loved each other The length of one song Thank you, it's really beautiful. No problem. How's it going? I mean... Did they find anything out? And the police don't help much... They told me that an adult male who doesn't come home to his girlfriend doesn't necessarily mean there's any crime. They even asked me if we had any relationship problems, or if there's a chance maybe he just left me. He would never just leave like that. Without saying anything. I had a brother who went missing... when I was a teenager. And he never showed up? He came back, after a few years. He was troubled. He had run away. But when he came back, he... He wasn't the same. We barely recognized him. Until he killed himself. How horrible. I don't know what to say. But you know... For me, it was really helpful to have people around me, who had been through the same thing. So... I want you to know that I'm here, okay? You don't have to go through this alone. That's very nice. Thank you. I apologize. I didn't mean to... No, it's me, I'm really tired and need to rest. It's been a rough week. Are you crying? I'm sorry. I'm really sorry for you. Please, calm down, really. Look at me... I came to your house and I make you deal with my bullshit. No, we're both going through a lot. It's understandable. It'll be okay. Calm down. Okay, it's over... -You need to leave. -I'm sorry. I don't care if you're sorry. Leave my fucking apartment! Get out! You sick fuck. Get out of my apartment, now! Go... Motherfucker. There was destruction following Argentina's 2nd place finish in the World Cup. At least 50 people injured, and 70 arrests. Including 15 injured police. It only took a small group of people out of the thousands who were there to put an end to the festivities. Incredible, you were able to cover everything. How crazy. Yeah, on camera you won't see anything. It's very simple... When we call action, the waiter starts from over there. The camera is going to come here, where the dialogue takes place. The ones on this side, please, do not look into the camera. I know you know, but I still have to say it. Don't do it, okay? We're going for a take... quiet. Let's get in position... Sound! Don't cry... Don't cry, don't make a scandal here. Listen, don't cry. Don't make a scandal. The truth is that Sergio wanted to kill himself because he was a romantic. He loved the idea of suicide. Like some sort of teenager infatuated with misery, and Morrissey. And with Shakespearian exits from the world. And in many ways he wanted, deep down, to be a lost and tormented soul driven to end it all. But he regretted it almost immediately. And just before losing consciousness... He imagined himself waking up in the hospital with only minor injuries. Maybe the gun could've malfunctioned. Or maybe he could've missed. These things happen, right? Why not? He wanted to be at home, lounging around in his underwear, like always. Smoking his French cigarettes, one after the other. He already missed the taste. He wanted to lay out on his couch... Feeling the cold leather on his skin... Doing nothing the whole day, as the world passed him by outside. But it was a real shame... because if he had stayed alive... he would've witnessed something really spectacular. The suicide of a Buenos Aires man was caught on video and has gone viral. He has been identified as Sergio Garces. Due to some bizarre details, many people wonder about his motives. Garces was working as an extra in a German film production in Buenos Aires... When he shot himself in the middle of an actual take. After it was learned that underneath his wardrobe, he was wearing the Argentina soccer jersey. Many concluded that he shot himself to try and sabotage the German production, because of Argentina's recent loss in the World Cup. In the aftermath of this tragic event, Garces has become somewhat of a National hero. Ironically, this would become the most majestic thing he had ever done on camera. In the end, Sergio was famous. Even though he wasn't alive to enjoy it. INITIALS SG
