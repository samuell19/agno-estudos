THE AX Shit! Shit! Asshole! This is my confession. This is my confession. After two and a half years... After tonight... I thought they'd all be as easy as the first. - Mr Birch? - Ja? That's me. My name is Bruno Davert. I can?t bear what I did tonight. There. I always was a husband, a father, a loyal employee. For your 15 years of loyalty to our firm, that is also your firm, please accept this modest gift, useful to note, at any moment, your creative ideas that have so helped our productivity. A digital Dictaphone. Sino-Japanese, even better than Japanese! 6 months later I was fired, with 600 others. Downsizing before relocation. Death to those who killed us! I'm not worried about you, Bruno. Your skills will soon get you a job. All that commotion! My lay-off check was 15 months? salary. I felt like a world champion. Over 2 years later, I still had no job. I'd almost paid off my car. I had a 10-year mortgage on my house, and a wife I loved, and still love. Listen... - Use a photo that's more... - More what? Sexier? More relaxed. I'm not relaxed there? Don?t blame me. As of now, I'll just send my resume and cover letter. I'm bad at selling myself... Watching crap again? Now we don?t have cable, TV sucks. Dad, you heard of Arcadia? I wrote them twice... No answer. Must be my photo! Is he relaxed? - He does the same job as I did. - Bruno... Watch, Dad! Arcadia's rolling in dough! People find paper boring... "But it's so complex..." This machine produces miles of paper all from recycled paper... He boasted of their new recycled paper, something I hadn't done years ago, before I was dumped by Kamer Papers! ...our chemical know-how made us a star stock market performer, because Arcadia... It's like you talking, dear. I'll zap him so you get his job. Zapping him won?t do it. I'm not the sole contender. How many are sexier, more athletic, smilier, more relaxed... Like that Mache... guy? Raymond Machefer! I'll bring him back to life! Yeah, Raymond Machefer. You know, we even eat paper. Ice-cream cones are made of it. I said to myself, this guy has your job. I had to find out how many qualified guys with sexy photos were ahead of me. I need a P.O. box number for my letterhead. I'm at the printer?s. I'll come pay you tomorrow. 89! Got something bigger? P.O. BOX INDUSTRIAL PAPERS P.O. BOX 8900? On the phone I said 89! We only have 120! The printer goofed. But it looks better. I need all the help I can get. Starting a business? Who are all those people? Collecting unemployment. New month starting. I phoned the mag "European Paperman" and ran a classified ad in French, English and German. I'll send you a postal order and the text. You'll have it by tomorrow. Thanks! A month later, I went back to the post office. Your two extra zeros got you answers! You're off to a great start! What's your thing? A poll. Wait! Who are you polling? People looking for work. You should have added two zeros! I felt so superior reading my competitors' secrets. I found out they were abysmally ignorant, and stank of vanity. Half said they cared about the stockholders! But they're the enemy. The stockholders! They get thousands fired from healthy businesses to get more for the greedy, open-mouthed beast. All those polished resumes reeked of conformism. But only 5 had degrees, careers and experience that seemed, if not better, at least as good as mine. Only 5! Lighting a fire now? I thought you'd gone out. Yes, I ran errands. Coming? I need the car. Where you headed? - It's Friday. - Can you wait...? No, but Jack's taking his son to a movie. - Doesn?t he work? - No. Like you, he needs a job. - He'll find one easily. - Why do you say that? - The way he shakes your hand. - So? He's an oily, smart-dresser. It's what they want. I don?t see him that way. A cold fish, ideal for a bank exec, for any business. Why do you say that? Just like that. He's kind and helpful. That's just what I'm saying. I'd grown hostile and anti-social. Marlene had found two small jobs. They paid peanuts. I stuck to my field. All the crap I'd taken made me one of the best. Once we had two cars, and hardly knew our clammy-handed neighbour. If I killed 1000 stockholders, I'd gain nothing. If I killed ten CEO's who'd fired 1000 employees, what'd I get? Nothing. They're my enemy, but not my problem. Those 5 resumes were my problem. Those 5, plus Machefer. - What are you up to? - Storing stuff Dad left me. - Can I help? - No need. Mom cut off the Web! I'm bored. Do your homework. - I've done it. - Go for a walk! It's raining! I wish I could talk to my dad. He had, as they say in the business world, a knack for this kind of thing. He'd fought in World War II, in the Tank Corps, and killed some enemies. But he's gone. Cigarettes and lung-cancer. Killed by nice guys who live by selling death, shaking with fear for their jobs. Good shot! Your turn. Come here! Come try a real gun! The first one lived quite close. He was Belgian. I thought it'd make things easier. I told Marlene I had a job interview. And checked out Henri Birch's home. Tank up with energy A dizzying idea came to me. A monthly gas-station hold-up would pay for the house, the car, the kids' education, and buy some steaks... Thanks, bye. Have a good trip, sir. Did people know that under those well-kept lawns the earth is shaking? No salary for a month, you panic. But no salary at all! Like me, he must wait for the mail-man. - Mr Birch? - Ja? That's me! - The paper engineer? - Yes, I'm Mr Birch. Why? Zapped, like on TV. That's what screwed me up. Need cash I'm cashing in - Well? - It went fine. - Where was it? - In Belgium. We have to move to Belgium? Worse things could happen... It's not done yet, but it went well, gave me confidence. We get all worked up, but in the end... That's what you need. What? Confidence. I'm confident! What's this resume? Nothing. A draft of a new one. I'll get you clean underwear. Edouard Rick, chemical engineer, has worked in the USA, Laid off 6 months ago. I'd hire him before I hired me. Coming? Or can I have the car? Where are you going? - It's my work day. - Of course. Sure. Give me a minute. I'm coming. Penny for your thoughts. I saw a guy selling all his possessions. Everything, even his mattress. We can, too. Wrong road! Today I'm a nurse, not a cashier. Sorry. What'll you do today? Sorry, I was in a cloud. You are more and more. - What'll you do today? - Nothing. What can I do? When should I drive you home? No need, Martin will. Who's he? My boss! You've met him twice. Nosferatu? Nosferatu the Vampire! Stop it! I'm driving. Nosferatu's in white. Hi, Martin! Hi, Mr Davert! I thought of my first zap. Would I be as lucky here? To be discreet, I parked by a house for sale. I decided to come back next morning, around mail time. What's all that? Sylvie's birthday gift. Perfects our English. Didn?t you pick up Mom? Dad! You got a fax. For an interview. They phoned, too! Wait here. We'll call you. I was in the land of the compulsory smile. But I'd forgotten how to smile. To be among these small fry wasn't a good sign. They didn't need my competence to make frozen-food labels. Mr Davert? Please come with me. You up there, if You exist, get me this job! Don?t do it for me: for Edouard Rick and the others, OK? Be seated. If it's for me... it should be there. It's watching me. Your resume's impressive. I'm a whiz at resumes. Your degrees, your career. How do you feel about food labels? Everything?s perfectible. You worked 15 years for a company, in a highly responsible position. What ended this? "Restructuring before relocation." The result: a 16% bonus for the stockholders... And 2 years unemployment for me. You owned shares... I sold them to cover my... And got a 16% bonus. What has unemployment taught you? The long term effects destroy the short term benefits. Where do you stand? Midway. Tech-innovations are limited here. Are you over-qualified? No... Who can do more, can do less. Could a woman fill this job? Sorry? Your job? The job to be filled. It requires certain qualities, which women don?t lack. But I'm no whiz about women. Are you as original in your work, as in your answers? I try to be. You know... I just read 2 manuals for interview success. They were so conformist. Are you a conformist, Miss? Mrs... Iris Thomson. Thanks for coming, Mr Davert. We'll examine your candidacy with great care. Is that all? Don?t you want to know what I can do, at what price? That's for the next interview, if it arises. Thanks for coming to see us. I said to myself: Lucky I didn't have the gun on me. For your next customer. Dad's coming, Mom! Leave me with him, kids. Not a chance! You can?t be so sure... Yes, I can! I'm on to their dirty tricks. - You'll get other chances... - You don?t understand! It's a disaster. I'll have to do it again. No, you have to keep at it. That's what I meant. I'll have to keep at it. If you're going on an interview... smile! Go inside. You'll catch cold. Leave her alone! Get out of our sight! You're sick. Leave us alone! You could be her father! You won?t get away with it! You're abusing of... Shame on you! - I'm not the person... - Listen! I'll call your wife! - I'm not... - You'll kill her father. What? Can?t we talk it over? Don?t move. There are doctors, I know some. Talking to them would relieve you! You came to threaten us, you creep! You'll destroy my daughter! I don?t care, I'll take this to the police! Hello... Police? There was a gunshot. I'm Edouard Rick. What is this? - Mr Rick? - Yes? None of us, specially me, understood what had happened. I decided I had to tell Marlene. Let her know I did it for her and the kids, prepare her for the police's arrival. Tonight or tomorrow. Dinner's ready, the kids are waiting. You OK? - Did it go well? - Horribly! I don?t understand why, it all went wrong. I'll wash and be right there. - Going out again? - No. Why? - I expect the police. - What? Dad, come watch! An engineer in paper got murdered! His wife, too. A guy killed them at their home, 90 miles from here. She's all dolled up today. Like she's hosting a fashion show! I used to see her when I rode my bike. Macaroni time! No TV while we eat! Mom, for once it's interesting! - Creep killed people. - They'll run it again and again! Let's watch now! - No TV at dinner... - Leave it on! Think it's a Mafia job? People kill over nothing now... Your dad's plate! These are immoral and insecure times. We're unprotected, we live in fear. - I saw an olive green car. - No, apple green. - Just like ours. - Ours is brown. - Brownish green. - No, greenish brown. That's what witnesses stated. It's an area of fine homes. One's for sale. What do you mean? Theirs! It's vacant now. Very funny! We could buy it. You're silly. The arrest of a suspect was confirmed by the DA's office. His name wasn't revealed. He's been questioned since 3 p.m. But it was leaked that he's Leon Ringer, a teacher and lover of Judy Rick, the victims' daughter. Eat, it'll get cold. The police drove Judy Rick to the DA's office to confront him. Miss Rick... When did you last see your dad? Little bitch! You had a crush on a teacher. He was so cute with his grey hair! Don?t bug me! ...I have high hopes that this tragedy for our city will soon be resolved. I couldn't let an innocent man be sentenced. I also couldn't say: I'll turn myself in. I had to tell my family now. But tell them what? It seems there are new developments... Mrs Ringer is coming out of the DA's office. Mrs Ringer, please! My husband isn't a murderer. He's in love. I told him he's free. I'm going to my parents' home, with my kids. - Was your marriage doomed? Eat, it'll get cold. Police are searching Leon Ringer's home for the murder weapon. - Look up there! - Top floor! - He's gonna jump! - Shit, it's the teacher! How horrible! Those shocking live images we just witnessed... A man just jumped... The cops got dumped on! Look at them! Turn off that TV! So there... I wasn't the killer after all. But if Mrs Rick hadn't been so dumb, it would've gone smoothly. I had to wind things up in a hurry. Staff reductions are cyclic. Soon there might be new candidates. Now only 3 resumes stood between me and Arcadia. Plus Machefer. Mr Etienne Barnet, please. The mail-man! Registered letter! Can I stop by later? Before 5 p.m., or tomorrow. - You his son? - No. Fine, bye. Shit! OK for Saturday: brunch and bridge! You're on! I'll leave at 4.30 p.m. Shit! What's he doing? Evening, sir. Is it for food or drinks? Food, just a snack. The special's ribs. It's great! That'll be fine... One special! And to drink? It's included. Their red's great. Then a glass of red. Just driving through? You could say that... Is there a cheap hotel here? Just a motel. Right, then straight. It's dreary. Modern: no human contact. Good. No human contact. You looking for work? - Does it show? - I can tell. I've been through it! Still am. I was lucky to find this for now. You work full-time here? Four days a week from 5 p.m. to midnight. I'm in paper. - Wallpaper? - No, specialised paper. 16 years with one outfit. Then dumped! I had to end our chat. To protect my mental health. That's your special. - Broke something? - It's fine. One more? On the house. - I'm driving. - We all gotta die! What side were you in? Stationary. Office supplies... Maybe we bought from you. No, our line was for aeronautics. These are criminal times. - Sorry? - I think a lot now. It's all you can do, as a waiter. Society is in an insane and novel phase. In ancient China, to save food, they abandoned babies in the mountains. Eskimos leave old men to die on an iceberg. But we dump people when they're most productive! That's what's novel. It's self-destruction. You're right. We maintain the elderly at a huge cost. If we let some die from summer heat, from fall despair, from winter cold or spring zest... We'd save the economy! Instead they dump us! It's driving you nuts, too. Sure! We'd do anything for a job! But you can?t fight turbo-capitalism! Seriously, what should we do? We should... A drop more red? Make human beings the center of everything. - But it's too late. - Waiter! Coming! Excuse me. - Leaving already? - Yes. It's a wasteland here. No jobs. For the motel, take a right. Good luck. He almost offered to put me up. We should link arms, not fight over the crumbs. While CEO's laugh... Or, worse, don?t even notice us. This is my confession... Before I end my life... To avoid the grief of my wife and kids. I can come back later. No. It's fine, do your work. Don?t drive doing this. Cops'll spot you! Talking into that gizmo helped me. No, you won't kill yourself or surrender to the police. To each his own. Well? I was backing... - I was advancing. - You saw me. And you saw me! Kill the music! He roared out! I'm sorry... You were littering. I had an accident. It calmed me down. When did it happen? 1 hour ago, in Rouvres, 25 miles back. Registration and license, please. Guy backed out at me. Here's the accident report. - Use the car for work? - To look for work. Get it fixed. Have a safe trip. Don?t litter to calm down. It's dangerous, too. Mr Davert! Marlene?s coming. Tom and I saw the movie. Thanks. I was away on business. It was a serial-killer movie. I shouldn?t have taken him. Time he knew. Tom, give it to that fellow. He's a ham! Excuse me. I had an accident. I'm waiting over there. - I went to the dentist?s... - Tuesdays and Thursdays. Friday and Saturday's the cinema. Has been for 11 months! I don?t have my head on straight. Hasn?t been on straight for a while. Stop it! What's all this? - And your interview? - What interview? You were gone 2 days. You had someone to see. - I saw him. - And? Let's drop it. You don?t discuss anything with me now. It's eating me up, if you knew! Me, too. I can?t take it anymore. I've had it. What am I supposed to do? We must do it together. The two of us. I have a plan. I'll find work, things? Il be like before. It'll be too late. We're growing apart. I love you, I want to save what we built over the years. Remember, we had a problem once? What problem? We saw someone and we solved it. It's not the same. Yes, it is. Think I'm cheating on you? - No. - Well? We need to get help. It's really urgent! Who is it? Fuck off! Who is it? We need a marriage counsellor. Who's the bastard? I'm sure we're worth saving. Say who it is! I'll take care of it! The problem's between us. Alright! I'll see whoever you want. Shit, helluva bang-up! Steering?s OK. Had it long? 4 years. I used to change every 2 years. What'll the tab be? 1400 Euros. I got 400 deductible, but I can?t... Times are tough, Mr Davert. - Hospital ejected my wife. - She was sick? No, worked there. X-ray technician. 11 years! Downsizing, restructuring, health costs... End result, we got screwed. Technicians find jobs. When? Where? Here's what we'll do. I'll do a 1600 Euros estimate for the insurance. And one for 1200 for you. - Very kind of you. - Gotta stick together. - I may be next. - You're the backbone here! We're 3. I'm the oldest, so I go first. - You're experienced. - But I cost the most. If I lose my job, I'll go upstairs and blow my brains out in front of the boss! Why not zap the other 2 guys? Out of foresight. Foresight! - You fight back! - I try to! When do I get my car? It's my only one. That's why business is so slow! Soon as I get an OK from the assessor. What if he wants to see it? He'd better not bug us! We can zap him, too! Out of foresight! All's fair! I'll call the assessor. Out of foresight! It's that door. - Thanks. - Have a nice day. Longus Quinlan. What is he, Irish? Scottish? Come in! Mr and Mrs Davert? Have a seat. Right... First, let's get rid of the basics. You've got a problem and want to solve it. My job isn?t to hand you a solution, but to help you find your own strengths, and your mutual expectations. We know what we want. You think you do. To recover what you had. Correct. Maybe that's not what both of you want. First, let's find that out. Mrs Davert... Why did you make this appointment? So I could talk to my husband. I thought Bruno wouldn?t be jobless for long, and it'd be a way for me to prove I was a worthy spouse and partner. But it went on... She complains! Money started getting short... If she knew what I do for her! And no clue as to who the bastard is! Sometimes he glares at me as if it was all my fault. Relax and listen to Marlene. What I need is a place to be happy, not a house, I don't mind if we have to sell ours. A place means, being with someone with whom you can talk and laugh. A man was affectionate to me. I responded. Sorry, I need... Left at the bottom of the stairs. Happens a lot. It's nerves. You're in terrible shape! You're nuts! What's with you? I was saying, thank God Bruno agreed to come here: I realised he cared for me. Thanks to you, I've talked to him. Speaking out, helps us to avoid becoming paranoid. Me, for instance. In this session I've wondered how you feel being counselled by a blackamoor. You probably wonder how I cope with all my wives. To the French, we're all polygamous. I only have one wife. I know how hard it is to build a lasting and sincere relationship. See you next week. Thank you. - What'll it be? - I'm expecting people. Isn?t that Raymond Machefer? Yes, it is. - You know him? - Vaguely. Nice guy. Great sense of humour. He once asked me if I was married. I said: yes. Did we get along? I said: yes. He said: divorce her while you're still on speaking terms! Rolf Krantz, under 45, jobless only 9 months, solid resume. Any opening will go to him. Krantz! Make your dreams come true Murderer! I understood you. Thank you. I'll come. That your bastard calling? - No, the police. - The police? - They've arrested Maxime. - Why him? - Caught in the act. - Doing what? Stealing! Sign there. The two boys came out with two bags of software. It's the store's 3rd robbery. We were watching it. They saw us, dropped the bags and ran. You didn?t catch them in the act. Sure it was them? Three officers recognised them. The boys confessed. Here's your son?s statement. The other boy's father is here. His kid's 18. He must come back tomorrow. It's his first offence. - We can?t be sure, sir. - I'm sure for Maxime. - Bruno, we're just trying... - I know that! It's a first for Maxime! Sir, we're not sure. Well, I am. I want to see my son. Here, fill in your employer's address. I'm looking for work. Put: "Unemployed". That entitles you to a public defender. - Relocation or downsizing? - Bit of both! - Happens more and more. - Not in your field. Crime's the only growing industry! I wonder why! You must convince Maxime to tell us everything. That's the way back to normal life. Mrs Davert! Open up! Is it the first time you've done it? Yes... Right. Listen, I don?t know your friend, or what he may say, but you tell the truth: it's the first and last time you'll do it. We'll get you out of here, son. I'll handle it. Come here! Does he have a stash? Does he? It's 3:20 a.m. At 6 a.m., the cops?ll search here. Your brother?ll go to jail! If you know anything, tell your dad. In that closet. My God! It's worth thousands. It's jail for sure! Get a garbage bag! There's more in the basement. Hurry! Close the trunk. Stay here, I'll go alone! The cops won?t come before 6 a.m. I'll be back. Tidy his room. Does software float? Garbage workers on strike My wife's sick! I'm due at the hospital! No one gets through! Have a heart! What if it was you? And they're dumb to boot! - Coffee's ready. - Can I have some? Sure. - No more milk. - Not to worry. - What'll we do? - Dump the coffee. - All of it? - Yes. Pretend you just woke up. Don?t open at once, say we're asleep upstairs. Chin up! - Is Mr Davert in? - Who is it? Police! - He's asleep. - Wake him up. I'll go wake them and get dressed. Make yourselves at home. You guard the door, you search the kitchen. Sorry, Mr Davert. DA's orders. Do your job. That's his room. Dominique, over there. The Republic v. Maxime Davert. The police may search our house. Let them. We've got nothing to hide, right? No? We do, Dad. It's serious. Your dad took care of everything. Cops came and found nothing. Sorry, Dad. I'll never do it again. Don?t worry, this'll be a breeze. OK, that's all over now. When you were laid off, did you feel anger, fear, resentment? Relief? Not relief, for sure. I liked my job. The rest, sure. Not right away, but later, yes. Why? Why what? Why anger, fear, resentment? What am I supposed to feel? I'm just trying to find out why anger, fear, bitterness? All the jobless feel that. All of them? You sure? What else could one feel? Don?t some people take it less dramatically? See it as a chance, like your wife, to face the situation with a positive attitude? Mr Quinlan... When we were fired, they sent us "social specialists", to encourage us to be creative and think positively about our problem. You sound like them. Because our message is the same. Your message and theirs is bullshit! I'm glad you're finally speaking out. Mr Davert... My message is: you're not your job. By taking my job away, they took my life away! My life! Ruining my whole family's lives. OK, work's not everything! But without it, what am I? How do I get by? My co-workers and I were like a tribe, working together, backing each other up. Getting laid off destroyed that tribe. We became enemies. - Enemies? - Worse, competitors. Every man for himself and no God! What does it mean to you... "Every man for himself?" I have to beat the competition, and can only count on myself. That's why I was distant and withdrawn. I'm sorry I was so cold with you. You're not alone, Bruno. You've got me. You know that. Can you give me a job? Can I help you? No, it's done. Have a nice day. Gabriel Blacher, please. A friend from the Kaiser-Packering Paper days. He's at work? He found a job? In labels? That's fabulous! Congratulate him for me. I'm thrilled for him! It'll work out. It's the police. It's about Maxime? - No, you. - Me? Leave it. - What's that? - Nothing. They've been waiting, they're acting weird. A drink for you? These gentlemen turned me down. Mr Davert? Detective Kesler, CID. Detective Zirner, of the German police. Please be seated. - You have a nice place. - My wife's work. Please be seated. Do you know a Henri Birch? No, I don?t. And Rolf Krantz? I don?t know that name either. You're currently jobless? Looking for a job. You've answered a lot of ads. Not a lot, but some. You met with Kendall-Cartons? Yes, I had an interview, but never heard back. Unless you're here to tell me! Birch and Krantz also met with Kendall-Cartons. - They saw many... - You knew Edouard Rick? - Sorry, no. - He, too, was in paper. What are you after? Paper's a vast industry! Birch and Krantz were murdered shortly after. Really? Murdered? Rick wasn?t interviewed by them. And he wasn?t murdered? Yes, he was. His wife, too. His wife, too? It looked like a sex crime, but we found a casing from the same gun. An SS officer's Luger... with an oddity! Old bullets that were made to save on copper. Any shot could backfire, which would be a blessing. Are you saying there's a psycho killing paper-execs? We don?t know if he's mad. Will you protect me? - We're understaffed for all of you. - Hire people! We'll never be enough. Look at these photos of the victims. Maybe you can help us. Not to worry... Hope I didn?t break anything. - Photos of corpses? - No. Faces can say more than names. They're the ones who... Sorry, I can?t handle this... - You don?t recognise them? - No. Anything odd happen at Kendall-Cartons? No. Typical interview. "Thanks, we'll be in touch." I know... My brother-in-law's jobless. He in paper? Metallurgy. Here. If you notice anything odd, call me. So I and my family are in danger? We always get them in the end. Got a lead? Is there a suspect? We're working on it! Bye, Madame. What did they want? Routine inquiry, do I know so-and-so. - And? - Well, I didn?t. I'm begging you, tell me the truth. What truth? They found the software? No. I swear it. - You sure? - I'm sure. I was so afraid. - I was so afraid. - Me, too. Really afraid. - Leaving, Dad? - Tell Mom I ran an errand. Polluter! Your business is booming! Here. - That's for me? - You're box 8900. Aren?t you glad? Here... Gift from the Post Office! You're a big hit! He's the only one. 40, many degrees, original. "I have a fine job, but want to work in Strasbourg." Creep! "My experience in the company..." "Of course, discretion..." "Contact my voice mail." No photo or address. This resume would charm any recruiter. They'll raid the competition before hiring a loser like me! I have to eliminate him before Machefer. I need a table Friday, for Patricia Stephane, CEO of industrial Papers. For 3 people. Can I have the table by the window? She has weak eyes and needs light. Thank you. See you Friday. Hello! You answered our ad in Papiers and Papers. We're interested, and wish to meet you as per your requests. Mrs Stephane, our CEO will attend the interview. I suggest next Friday at 1 p.m. at the Flanders Cafe on Cathedral Square. See you Friday, I hope. I'll miss my date. - Need a job? - No, a husband. - About time! - Asshole! Betty, please! Put that away. Dishwasher's on the blink. I'll buy a new one. I'll do it by hand. - What were you doing? - Putting them away. You OK? - How much? - 3.50. Can I help you, sir? Just looking around. Want to try one on? I'll come back with my wife. Let me see the cut. - You a 46? - If you say so. Which colour? First, let's see the cut. You can pick the colour with your wife. Come, sir. In here. Come along. Please, sir. I think I need one size up. A 48? Sure. It fits you fine. Almost perfect. Turn around. Not bad. And the trousers? If you'll allow me... Try to choose yourself. Gerard Hutchinson. I used to buy my clothes with my wife. But one day... I hope it never happens to you. I lost my job. A year later, she left me. This isn?t my real job. I'm a design engineer in paper chemistry. I lost my job 5 years ago. It's tough. I don?t wish it on you. Not my problem, I'm a bureaucrat. I had a lunch date in a restaurant for a job in paper. Just after I got there, a couple came in. I noticed them at once: a tight-assed CEO woman who was with... a scumbag flunky who probably scouts for her. She glanced at me, shook her head. They left without even bothering to come over and say... jackshit! We can take in the sides. That's fine. Perfect. We're on commission here. It's humiliation, but... After being jobless 5 years, you're a... How do you say in French? - A "has been". - Right, "has been". They can tell just by looking at you. Even beefing up my resume, it doesn?t fly. At the restaurant they left without even... This is a good job. Why go back to paper? This isn?t for me. Mind you, in paper as in other fields, they'll prefer someone who hasn?t been out of action long. 5 years... It rules you out. I must face it. You're right! Anyway... Talking to you helped me. You listen well. Better than a shrink. You'll laugh, but to top it all, a cop came to see me. Seems there's... some nut who's after me. - You'll be OK. - I feel pursued. Sorry, I'm a bit paranoid. Come back with your wife. - You have kids? - Yes, two. Me, too. Don?t see them now, they sided with their mom. Why be scowled at once a week? - Found a gem yet? - We're close. OK, see you later. Just us for dinner. He phoned. A good sign. - This what you want, Mom? - Perfect. I think Dad's on to something. That's what worries me. It may be another let-down. - Where are we? - At my place! Fuck, you been here before. Shit! I'm late. Doesn?t matter. What topic did you pick? "Can the end justify the means?" - What'd you say? - It never justifies the means. Except to keep your son out of jail! Leave him alone. Did you expand on it? I said: "Except in wartime." In fact, the choice of means is a luxury for the privileged few. Even in wartime. Anyway, "practice exams" are crap. - Philosophy, too? - Eat! Dad's rushed. Not here. Finish your meal! What are we celebrating? 20 hours of community service. Case closed. Thanks to Dad. Thanks, Dad. I hope from now on, things will look up, really look up. Any day now. Producing 700,000 tons a year, this machine set a new world record. You may not realise it, but this roll represents 100 miles of paper. That means 1500 miles per day. If you multiply... Come closer! ...by 365, it's over 3 million miles. What matters is that man is at the center of it. Here, automation is secondary to man. It's a German machine. My goal: to improve work conditions, while boosting productivity. For the thermodynamic paste, 50% is recycled products. But I've perfected a way of raising it to 80%... Wake up! Don?t move! Who are you? Did Dany send you? She won't get a cent, you'll pay! Mr Machefer... Why are you here? I don?t know any Dany. Sorry, I fell asleep. Why are you in my home? I was waiting for you. To talk to you. I admire you. You break in, then make fun of me! He admires me! I didn?t break in, it was open. Where? The door. In the living room. Let's go look. I'm no thief, they don?t doze off. I saw the light, knocked, walked round... Saw no one, it was open. Stay there! Careful. It's that one. It was open, so was the other. They're all open, sir. Damn cleaning woman! So, what do you want? Just to chat. I lost my job. What's it to me? My name?s Davert. An exec in paper, like you. - Where? - Kamer Papers. - Didn?t they merge? - Right. Then staff reduction, relocation. The whole gamut! Bastards! I saw your DVD in Papiers and Paper. They cut it! I look like a fool. You're a master in your field. I screw up my interviews. I've lost faith in myself. I came to ask for a few tips. You're my last hope. - Why not phone? - I'd look crazy. So I came over, let myself in, and fell asleep. You bushed? - What was your name? - Easy... Hand it over. Bruno Davert, 41 years old. Kamer Papers. Know what? Let's have a drink. I won?t say no. We'll relocate to the kitchen... closer to the vintage stuff. Those in favour, follow me. CEO's are creeps. Except mine at Arcadia. That's music to my ears. - Where'd they relocate? - Romania. Where guys work for 3 times less. - So they're right to fire us? - No, they're idiots. Once they've fucked up the economy, who'll they sell to? To the Romanians? The Czechs? The Slovaks? The Poles? What if you got fired? I head for the boardroom and mow them down! Won?t get you your job back. It'll feel good. Sit down. Know what? You had a close call. I've never offed anyone, but I was really tempted... Be careful... - Cognac or vodka? - Bit of both, sir. Together? No, sir. You... Quit calling me "sir". Call me "Ralf". Name's Raymond. I prefer Ralf. Here... smoke. No thanks. You know... my wife almost left me. Mine left with Jerome. Said I worked too hard. Been years since I talked paper. We talk profitability, overhead, cost price, margins, profits... They don?t give a fuck about paper. The problem is waste. On a global scale. We need to grapple with... ...recycling waste. That's a job for people like us! Save the planet, stop wrecking it for money. - Not thirsty? - Sure. Your idea is good. - Recycling? - No. I'll test it for you. It's a first for me. Stick with the cognac, it's awful. Why have more, sir? Don?t say "sir"! It's awful, but I like it. Alcohol coma! Don?t worry, I got no school tomorrow. Damn him! Shit! - What are you doing? - Rowing. - We looked all over. - Why? Someone called? We worried. You just left. I'm in lousy shape. I can hardly... Don?t overdo it. We care for you. I'm coming. He's started rowing again. A good sign. Maxime! Hurry. I'm waiting for a call. It's his first call from a girl! What do I care? - Don?t be all day! - Call you back! Dad needs the phone. Why are you all home? Midterm break. Five days already... Why don't they call? Where did I fuck up? You'll overdo it! Hutchinson, the striped suit... I bet he got the job. No, he's washed up. Arcadia may see him, but not hire him. He's through... Fuck it! Fabulous! Can I come too? Dad! Checked your e-mail? - No, why? - One came yesterday. - Arcadia? - I think so. What does it say? Call them at once. Why didn?t you tell me? I don?t read e-mails. Please contact us within 24 hrs. You put on weight. It won?t close. - No, you wash on the hot cycle! - No way! You set them on fire, like me! - Stop it! - You're sizzling! I can tell. Not in front of the kids. This'll calm you down. My pep's coming back! It's that detective. - Hello, Mr Davert. - Hello, detective. - On your way out? - Right. I'm a bit... Can it wait till tomorrow? Best get it over with. Leave us. Come with me. I haven?t told my wife and kids. I told my wife we need a house like yours. Hutchinson, you know him? No. Should I? Paper business. Don?t tell me he, too, was... He looks familiar. But not from paper... He'd lost that job. Worked in a men's clothing store. He hung himself. Hung himself? He left a note: "I'm quitting it all. What's the point?" Pretty obvious... no? You think it was he who...? We think so. I told you we always get them. You and your family can relax now. I wanted to reassure you. Good news, no? Sorry, but I'm not thrilled. Goodbye, then. How's the job-hunting? I've got a lead. Then, break a leg! Break a leg... Right... Break a leg. Are they gone? What did they want? What did they say? - Nothing. - Will they be back? No, they wanted to reassure us. Arcadia's paper research division invests in the future. For us at Arcadia, paper will be... the raw material of tomorrow. New strategies will change our technicians' lives. This machine turns out miles of paper. We'll be using 80% recycled paper to spare our trees... - What'll it be? - Glass of port.
