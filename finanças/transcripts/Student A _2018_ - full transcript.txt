THE TRUTH TO STUDENT "A" FALLING FROM SCHOOL ROOF ON OCTOBER 17, 2005 There was a bird that couldn't stop crying. "Why are you crying?" Fox asked the bird one day. "Because I've forgotten my name," replied the bird. Then Fox said, "I will call you 'A.'" Attention! The winner of the book report contest is… Lee Baek-hap. Come up. Go, prez! -Thank you. -Good job. Third place is Jang Mi-rae. Mi-rae? Come on up. Baek-hap will also get books. You'll get gift vouchers. Why clap? Grab a partner! -Where were you? -Here. One, two! Stretching is important to avoid injuries. One, two. One, two. One, two. Next! -What? -Look at her! She doesn't know? -Should we tell her? -How embarrassing! She just realized! Can I borrow your sweatshirt? What? Why ask me? -She's coming! -Look away. Go to the nurse's office. It'll be on the exam. Make sure you study. From 1498 to 1545. Starting from King Yeonsan to King Myeongjong of Joseon. There were significant wars and political changes then. Go on! Sit down. They formed groups and fought each other. They're called factions. Study hard and ask if you need help. Lunch time! Let's go! What's that? Wanna have lunch together? Let's go, Baek-hap. Aren't you coming? Let's eat together. -What's with her? -She's way too nice. Ah… I'm sorry. What's with her? Who cares? Why talk to her, prez? I heard her drunk dad went crazy, and the cops came last night. He's like a monster. LIBRARY HELPER, JANG MI-RAE The light refracts through the convex lens. If you focus on one spot, what happens? GRAND PRIZE 20 BOOKS SECOND PRIZE 10 BOOKS THIRD PRIZE GIFT VOUCHERS (20,000 WON) GIFT VOUCHER 10,000 WON WONDERER, DARK 666 WONDERER, YUELLEUAN WONDERER, HUI-NA MARCUS, WIZARD OF GELLION Dark! Be careful! When we attack, aim for his pendant. Don't save me! I can just die! YOU'VE RESCUED HUI-NA -What a shot! -What arrow was that? -Sir Dark rocks! -Dark made us win! I told you not to rescue me. We need you. We're members of the same guild. You used an item, didn't you? Yes. How did you know? You never buy items. Got an allowance? Good work. Thanks, bro. I thought Marcus would kill us. Let's get new items too! -I'm so happy we won! -Right! It's been ages! It's our first meeting in a month. Has it been that long? I guess you're right. -Can you stay logged on this long? -I'm home alone. I'm playing in secret. Mom hates me playing games. My mom too! That's why I have my earphones in. Dad's home, bitch. Come out and greet me. Where's the booze? I want the booze now! I warned you not to lock the door. Open up! Mi-rae! What were you doing in the dark? He got drunk again? You placed third on purpose, right? What are you always writing? It's just… a story I'm working on. Really? Is it for the literary contest? I'm writing a story, too. Wanna help each other write? Baek-hap! Lee Baek-hap! "I'm cursed. Everyone I like becomes sad," explained Fox. Then "A" said, "I'm cursed too. I can't fly." "What a lie!" said Fox. Suddenly, "A" spread her wings and jumped off the cliff. It's great! So "A" fell to her death? She's not dead yet. She fell, but I won't let her die. How can she survive if she fell from that high? Well… You really are weird. Wait! It's a compliment. I think you're unique. Sometimes, main characters die in movies or novels. There's probably a reason why, right? My story is different. No one gets hurt in my story. So how does the story end? I'm not sure. Then how about this? What's today's movie? It's Drumline. Okay. Got the video ready? -Yes. -Good. I'll check attendance later, so don't sneak off! -Yes, ma'am. -Yes, ma'am. -Let's go. -Not yet. -She's gone! -Let's go play! Let's go, too. DRUMLINE WONDERING WORLD ENDS IN 15 DAYS WONDERING WORLD 3D COMING SOON Bro? How can this happen? I know. Our guild will be gone soon. But there's still time left. Most members left after seeing the notice. Hi, Sir Dark. I guess this is goodbye. But… We can make a new guild in a different game. But it won't be Wondering World. I'll be going then. Hui-na? Thank you. You were the only friend who I could talk to. Look for a star there. That's where I am. Come find me whenever you want to talk. Check your names on the group work list I posted. Prez? -Yes! We're in the same group! -Which group are you in? Man, why are we in the same group? What's wrong with that? I'll make the sauce. Let's just follow the recipe. You make the soup base. You cut this. Go on! Hurry! Hey! Hurry up! You're so frustrating! Wanna take the pictures? But I'm not good at it. Just get our faces and the ingredients. That's all you did? What's taking so long? Don't take all day! How frustrating! Cut the food with me. No way! Mi-rae! Are you okay? It's because you grabbed me! I didn't do it on purpose! I swear. This should help. -Let's go treat it upstairs. -Okay. Sorry. I didn't mean to. It must sting. What if it leaves a scar? Oh, no. It's okay. Take this and put it on before it scars. Okay… Thanks. Did you write more of your story? I can't wait to hear what happens next in your story. When "A" opened her eyes, she was in someone's hands. Rough but warm hands. She looked up to see a man. "Are you okay?" said Fox as he ran over. "Don't be sad, 'A.'" It's good. I like that "A" is happier now. -Really? -Yes. Why bring the kids over? I'm sorry. Where did you rank in the midterms? First in my class and 19th in the school. That's not good enough! Please, dear. I'm sorry. Don't ever think about writing again. She'll get extra points if she wins the literary contest. Go to your room. Don't give her any crazy ideas! Where does 813 go? Korean novels. Are there books on drums here? -Drums? -Yes. I'm taking drum lessons. My tutor says I'm a natural. Wow! I practice on pads for now. That's cool. I'll show you. What do you think? You're amazing! I'll get the book. Hey, book club! What's that? I'm taking drum lessons. Really? Finally came to your senses, huh? Girls love drummers! Really? Come on. Hold still. You gotta dress the part. Stay still! How can you breathe like this? Loosen up, dude. There. See? Doesn't he look cool now? -I don't like it. -Girls will love it! -I just started playing. -How long have you played? -Two weeks. -It's a start. Welcome to band club. Tae-yang? You got into band club? That's cool! What do you play? The drums. Move! -He's my best friend, you know. -So? -Call me to talk to him. -Really? What's your number? I'm in the band now. Why's he talking to her? -Are they dating? -No way! That's great. What's with her? The doll's head is huge! What should I do? I'm up next. It's cute. Just hug it. -You're hugging it? -Why not? Bye! Thanks, bye! Wait up! Hui-na? I'm Dark. Surprised I'm a girl? I came because I need to talk. You don't mind, do you? A boy I like joined the band club. Then he'll be even more popular. I should give up, right? If he finds out I like him, he'll hate me. Is that for me? Give it to him? By the way… About boys… Boys? Think a boy would like this as a gift? Well… They seem to like whatever I give them. I see. Got a crush on someone? No! Of course not. -Who is it? Tell me! -I don't have a crush. How could I… You're a great person. So, who is it? Stop. I don't like anyone. -Say it or I'll tell everyone! -Stop it! You could use a haircut. -Tae-yang? -Yeah? Here. What? Thanks. I really like it. What do you write in there? Well… It's sad. So she dies at the end? I guess so. It's still good. You placed third last time, right? Yes. Why not enter the literary contest? But I'm not done writing it. I like it because it's not finished. Really? It's good the way it is. I went to Hongdae after school yesterday. Really? The band club went to a concert. It was incredible! I'll tell you more tomorrow. Let's go to Hongdae sometime. Bye! See you tomorrow. Have you been to Hongdae? Is it nice? It must be a cool place. Aren't you hot? Must be suffocating. That's good. Partner up with someone! -Let's be partners. -What? Hey, Baek-hap! What are you doing? You can find another partner. But you're my partner. I can partner with someone else! Quiet! Make your groups! How's your story coming along? I didn't write any more. Still, I entered the contest. -Why! -Huh? -Next move! -Yes, ma'am. You said you wouldn't enter the contest! But he said I should try. Who? Well… You don't have to help today. Only a few books came in. Really? Then you rest. I can do it myself. You cut your hair? Does it look weird? No, I like it. Really? I got a haircut. What? Because of what I said? Sort of. It suits you. Really? I gotta go somewhere near your place today. Can I walk you home? Unless you don't want me to. No, let's go together. Great! I'm all done. You'll tell me about Hongdae on the bus, right? Hongdae? Not today. I'll tell you next time. Take your seats now! Lee Baek-hap! Jang Mi-rae! How could you? Why would you submit the same story? This is a major problem! The contest committee is demanding answers. Fess up. Who copied whom? Must be Mi-rae. You won't talk? Come to the office. Both of you! So you wrote it? Yes. Then Baek-hap is lying? -Well… -Mi-rae. Know why scholars in the past kept orchids in their rooms? To grow their noble honor along with the precious plant. Noble honor, you know? Think of the orchids and be good. Understood? -You wasted it! -No, you did! You wrote it, didn't you? What are you doing? Dad… Are you out of your mind? You're stealing already? I'll teach you a lesson! Dad! I'm so sorry! I won't do it again! Get the hell out of my sight. Dad… Can I have just 1,000 won? What? For a gift? It's my birthday today. What gift! Having you was a mistake! Shut the door! "When will my tears stop flowing?" "It must be hard." "I'm sad because you're crying." As Fox cried along, "A" said, "I want to die." "I want to die too." Fox and "A" decided to die together. GUARDIAN OF THE LONELY FOREST You're alone, too. Time is running out for you. And me, too. REVIVE AND PLAY AGAIN END GAME WONDERING WORLD IS NO LONGER IN SERVICE I came to say goodbye. Thanks for everything. Take care. Stop! But you're… I'm Hui-na. You're a guy? So? Dark turned out to be a middle school girl. It's so hot. You want to die? I’m right, huh? Are you ready? What about the will? Decided recently, huh? Think of things to do. You can’t die right away anyway. How do you know? I’m going to die too. You’re still alive. Want me dead now? That’s low. Totally not like Dark. How old are you? I'm an adult! So watch it, kid. But you used to call me "sir." Why aren’t you at school? I don’t have to go. I’ll die soon anyway. Have you thought of things you want to do? If I die, it’s over. So why should I? Won’t you have regrets? If you go up there, there'll be no use in regretting. So let’s do everything we want with no regrets. Tell me what you want to do. Nothing. Wanna go to Hongdae? Hongdae? You wanted to go too. IF TWO CAN FINISH THE MEGA PIZZA, IT’S FREE! Why are we here? They only take orders for two or more. I couldn’t come here alone. It’s here! If you eat this within 20 minutes, it’s free. If you can’t, you’ll have to pay. Ready? Start! If we can’t finish, this costs a lot, right? Don’t worry. I have money. But free would be nice. Thanks for today. I’ve never done that before. Wait. I’m more thankful. I did one thing I couldn’t do by myself. There. Now... what do I do? Write your will to someone who’ll be sad when you die. No one will be sad. Wait here. It’s a gift. Write down things you want to do. If you can’t do something alone, I’ll help you. Well, actually... There’s one more thing I can’t do alone. Will you help? MY WILL THANKS, MOM, FOR THE STRAWBERRY You could’ve come by yourself. Who goes to the dentist alone? It’s scary! Wu-yeong? You're next. -Let’s go. -No way! Hold my hand, please? Hyun Jae-hui? Come in, please. -Go. -Right. Let go! Doctor... Please! Don’t... don’t kill me! Mom! That man is crying! It’s okay. It won’t hurt. He’s not crying. Don’t cry. You know I didn’t cry, right? Does it hurt? Totally! You have no idea! Just one more left. Did you write up your list? Yes, but... Why did you make me wear this? Just read this for me. Lee Tae-yang! Huh? Just read that. Lee Tae-yang! I’m... sorry. Sorry for what? For dating Baek-hap suddenly. I wanted to tell you first. Then why were you nice to me? I was? Why’d you stay and watch the movie with me? I'd already watched it before. I’m sorry. Why didn’t you say you liked Baek-hap? Why confuse me like that? Know how low that is? Sorry, I didn’t know. Did you even think of me as a friend? Yes. No. You never thought of me as a friend. If you did, you would’ve said that I wrote the story! It was all I had. I’m really sorry. If I die, will you be sad? Don’t die. If you’re gone, I’ll be really sad. That’s it. This is wrong. It’s fake. If you’re set on dying, talk to him for real. I'm hungry. -What? -She’s back? How can she come to school? She’s shameless. You really won’t tell the truth? What truth? About what? Look, Mi-rae. It doesn’t matter who wrote it now. What matters is that it’s been resolved. But it matters to me that I wrote it. Look at my orchids. See the flower buds? For them to bloom, things must be tougher than normal. Only then will the buds form and the flowers bloom. I’m the real writer. Why were you absent? -Well... -I understand. I’ll note them as sick days. Don’t worry. Let’s not cause a scene. Great timing. I was worried you wouldn’t come. Are you waiting for someone? Yes. There’s something I gotta do. It’s the last thing on my list. Ever had a friend who’d take your side no matter what? No. I had a friend like that. Must’ve been nice. There’s no one on my side. I’m sure there is. You just can’t see it. What do you know? The world is full of misunderstandings. Help me up. Wait! Come back! Hey! PLAGIARISM IN SCHOOL LITERARY CONTEST You did this? I didn’t say anything. Then who’d do this! Who else would make a fuss besides you! There’ll be a disciplinary hearing now. Let’s run for it! Weren’t you mad at me? Not really. Anything you want to do? I wanna watch a movie. Come out, come out, wherever you are. I found you! That's enough now. The rose of Sharon has bloomed. I just said that the flower bloomed. Why did you move? I’ll be right back. Yes. I remembered. Why’d you come out? I just came for fresh air. The movie was boring. I wish my dad were dead. My parents are divorced. Dad moved to Alaska, and Mom got remarried. No one cares about me. They won’t even notice when I’m gone. It’s a good thing. I don’t have to write a will. No one will be sad if I die. Go back to class now! Vice Principal Lee? Did you call their parents? No, I haven’t yet. What are you teaching here? We want to resolve this quickly. This is a serious problem. If you confess, we’ll let it go. You could both be suspended. It would remain on your records. Who copied whom? Mr. Lee? Please call their parents. They should come now. Sir? I... Guys! Holy cow! Big news! Baek-hap... Baek-hap confessed that she copied Mi-rae's story! -What? -Her parents are here too. Everyone knows about the issue we had here. It’s all been resolved, so let’s forget and move on. Our vice president, No-ran, will be president from now on, okay? -Yes, Mr. Kim! -Okay! That's great news! HAUNTED HOUSE One, two. One, two. Like getting your picture taken? Nope. I just want a cool picture for my funeral. What? Funeral portraits look so serious. I want mine to be special. She’s got some nerve! How can she sit there? She’s so weird. They broke up, right? I knew they would. -It was weird from the start. -Right. Watch this. Oops! Sorry. Why’d you put it there? Mr. Kim asked for a thorough cleaning. It’s your turn today. Do a good job. I’ll check on Monday! -Saw that? -Yes! Way to go! Let’s go! Come on! Class is starting! Who did this to Baek-hap? Mi-rae? Tell me who did this to her. Take your seats. Attention! Listen up. We're going to look at a poem by Kim So-wol called "On My Way." I'll read it out loud for you. "I miss you. Should I tell you?" Excuse me. I’m sorry! Back then... I’m so sorry. I won’t forgive you. I never will. But still... I’ll forget it. So you can forget it too. Take care. Let’s not meet again. Hey! That hairstyle doesn’t suit you! You were waiting for him? He was my best friend in high school. But... I bullied him. Because I was sick of being bullied. I’m done with my bucket list. I’ll get going. Take care. Can’t you see that? Why didn’t you clean it? You’ll get me in trouble! Go clean them. It’s your turn to clean. What? Who’s helping? What are you doing? Can’t you tell I’m punishing her? Why? Aren’t you mad? I was able to write it because she helped me. She just copied you! She probably didn’t do it on purpose. People can make mistakes. This will heal too. Get back inside! Didn’t you hear me? Go inside! What’s going on? What’s all this? Prez? What happened? It was Baek-hap’s turn to clean, but she... Who made this mess? Tell me who did this! What? Was it you? Well... Tell me! You did it! You did? Why? I did it, but... But what? You explain, prez! Someone saw her do it yesterday. Everyone inside now! Listen up. Well... Jang Mi-rae won the literary contest. She’ll enter the national contest as our school representative. Let's give her a hand! Come up, Mi-rae. I knew you could do it. Clean up! Hurry! Hurry! You come here. Know why scholars in the past kept orchids in their rooms? To grow their noble honor along with the orchids. Do you get what I’m saying? Watch it! Careful! Don’t raise up dust! Chalk dust is harmful to orchids! -Go over there! -Yes, sir. What are you doing? Careful! That plant is very fragile. Give it to me. I’ll water it. You can’t just water it! Give it to me. Wait! Don’t harm it! Mi-rae! -Isn’t that an orchid plant? -Mi-rae! Stop! The soil will fall out! Mi-rae! Come back! Go play in the yard! Move! Go play outside! -Tomorrow’s test will... -Mi-rae! Stop! Mi-rae! Mr. Kim! Where are you going? Mi-rae! Mi-rae! Stop! Mi-rae! No! Mi-rae! Freeze right there! Don’t move! Why’d you go up there? Stay there! Stay still! Don’t move! Mi-rae! No! Mi-rae? I didn’t know you liked it that much. You can have it! I’ll give it to you. You’ll really give it to me? Of course! Keep it! Now, get down here. Come down. You really don’t need it? No. I’ll let you keep it. Now, come down. I don’t need this either. No! Mi-rae... Mi-rae! Mi-rae! -Mi-rae! -Mi-rae! -Is she dead? -Mi-rae! Mi-rae! Are you okay? Are you hurt? She’s alive! I’m sorry. It’s okay as long as you’re not hurt. That’s mine. I came to say goodbye. What will you do now? I’m all prepared. I decided how I'm going to do it. Thanks for everything. Take care. Your will. You have to give it to me! You have to write it to me. It won’t be easy for me to accept it. I’m a good writer. The spelling and grammar must be perfect. And you have to write neatly. And... “Then when will we die?” “About 100 years later.” “That long?” When "A" asked this, Fox smiled and said, “There are many things I still want to do.” -Alaska? -Yes. I can see the northern lights there. Great! Will you meet your dad? I left him a message, but he still doesn’t care. Remember, I’ll only accept a perfect will. I won’t be writing it for a while. There’s a lot on my bucket list. Wait. This is for you. What’s this? A letter. Read it later. When will you be back? I may not come back. I might go to college there. The bus is here. -Take care. -Bye. “I want to see more of the world.” "A" watched Fox getting ready to leave and said, “I won’t cry anymore.” Fox looked at "A" and said, “You’ll be fine by yourself now.” Fox left, and "A" was alone again. She gained a name, but her friend was gone. She was sad again. “Though I’m sad, I won’t cry ever again.” "A" promised herself. WHEN YOU'RE SAD, IT'S OKAY TO CRY FROM HUI-NA You came? Look at this. “Miraculously, teenage girl ‘A’ fell on a tree and wasn’t injured.” “She said she flew for ten seconds before landing on the tree.” Did you really fly that day? I don’t remember. Hi! Why are you so late? You were just early again. Look at this. It’s my story. Middle school was fun, right? She ran so fast back then. My parents aren’t home tonight. Who wants to come over? Me! I’ll go, too. What about you? Sorry, I have to meet someone. What? With who? Well... -Tell us! -Who is it? A guy? -No way! -Really? It’s Hui-na!
