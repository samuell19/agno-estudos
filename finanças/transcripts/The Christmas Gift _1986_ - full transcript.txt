(horns honking) - [Santa] Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. (horns honking) - Oh, Mr. Billings. - Merry Christmas, Louella. - Mr. Renfield has been looking all over for you. It's urgent. He's in his lair and he's growling. - [Woman] Good morning Mr. Billings. - Merry Christmas Darlene. - [Man] Hi George. - Hiya, Chris. - He said not to stop at your office, but to go straight there. - Mr. Billings there you are. Do you know Mr. Renfield-- - Only six more shopping days till Christmas. - Mr. Billings. - I know, I know. - I found it, Ellie. - Mr. Billings, Mr. Renfield is, Mr. Renfield is-- - I know. - Oh. - The piano. The very last piece. - Mr. Billings, he is frantic to see you. - Alex is just gonna love this. Don't you think? - Of course she will. I think you'd better get to the lair before Renfield starts chewing the furniture. - Okay? - Mm-hm. - Now, we only have till the 31st to sow our seeds for profit, and from you I haven't heard one unusual, unique, or potentially profitable idea. - Well, I say put our money in the South, Mr. Renfield. - Right, on the coast, grab some of those islands. - Islands bring hurricanes, Edmunds. - The desert sunbelt. No money down, and the rest of your life to pay. - It's too hot. We'd lose our summer business. People, people. We're putting our money into year-round living. We're selling clean air, 24-hour security, trees, lots of trees. Shade, not beachfront sand, green lawns, golf courses, shade. Seasons. Spring, with its pretty little wildflowers, autumn, with the turning of the trees, and winter, with its snowy little wonderland. George. George, come in, come in, come in. You all know George Billings, our best and brightest architect. - [Man] Morning, George. - Sorry, I'm late, last-minute Christmas shopping. - George, you know about our company's relationship with Tompkins International. - Of course, they're our biggest client. - Yeah, and this year, it's bigger than ever. They've filled our stockings with the largest single tax-shelter investment that's ever come through this office. (everyone laughs) Geor, sit down, George. Come on, sit down. We have to spend the money by the 31st. You can see, we have some ideas in motion. - I certainly do, Mr. Renfield. Looking for some land, I'd say, suitable for development along the lines of what we did in Vermont last year. - Precisely. - Putting money in good, low-cost, but attractive land near a small, friendly, folksy town. But with easy access to a large city. - Right on the money. - Something on the order of the condo complex that I've been working on. With a golf course, tennis courts, skiing too. - [Woman] Oh, that's brilliant, I like that. - I am blessed with the foresight of our pioneer ancestors, who looked to the Rocky Mountains with the knowledge that there was but one direction to travel, west. (screen whirs) Colorado. And George Billings' latest recreational development, while it's still on the drawing board, is the answer to how Thomas Renfield is gonna pull this one off. And make millions for Tomkins International. And millions more for ourselves. (everyone chuckles) That'll be all for today. Leave the rest to George and me. - Well, good luck, George. - Thank you, Ms. Edmunds. - We're counting on you, George. - I'll do my best, sir. - Bigger and better than your ski lodge in Vermont last year. - I'll remember, Mr. Wiley. - Go get them, George. (door thuds) - So, what's this all about? - To begin with, you, George. - Me? - Ever since you lost your wife about a year ago, you've done nothing but throw yourself into your work. - It's been my way of dealing with it. - Of course, of course, of course. But now it's about a week till Christmas, that's the worst time of the year to deal with the loss of a loved one. I think you ought to take that little girl of yours and go on a vacation. - To Colorado? - Georgetown, Colorado. Tucked away in the hills, it's private, it's remote, less than an hour from Denver. - You want me to go there and survey the area. - [Renfield] Two days tops. - Just like Vermont last year? - Exactly the same, you go in as a tourist. - So as not to make anybody suspicious and drive the real estate prices up. - Walk around, take pictures, make sketches. - And call you. - And I'll make Georgetown a profit in our pocket by the 31st. - Then Alex and I can hit the slopes. - Oh, that's the spirit, George. I knew you'd see it my way. - Get this Christmas behind us. - Let's see, this is Friday. You leave Sunday. George, be a big raise waiting for you when you get back. - Thanks. - George, I'll be waiting for your call. (door creaks) (holiday music) (equipment clattering) (holiday music) (briefcase thuds) (holiday music) - Butter, where's the butter? We need butter. - [Child] Careful. - [Child] Butter, butter, butter. - Great, great, great. - [George] Hello, I'm home. - Hi, Daddy. Hi, Daddy. - Oh, hello, sweetheart. Hi, Helen. - Hello, Mr. Billings. - Sorry I'm late. - I know, work. - (laughs) These three have been cooking up a Christmas storm. - Ooh. I can smell it, I can see it. Hi, ladies. - Hi, Mr. Billings. - Hi, Mr. Billings. - Mm. Fantastic. (girls giggling) - We're planning Christmas week. The whole week. We'll go ice skating at the Rockefeller Plaza-- - Well, there may be a little change in plans. - We have to see the windows on Fifth Avenue. You and Mommy always took me to see Santa. I've already called for Chinese. Number five, number 18, number 36, and one order of steamed rice for you. - We'll talk about where we're going after dinner. - Raggedy Ann says, Merry Christmas. - Like I said, we have a change in plans. - Daddy, I don't wanna go away. - Alex, please. Mr. Renfield has asked me to go to Colorado. - All you ever do for Mr. Renfield is work. - He thinks it would be a good idea for us to go away together, have a Christmas vacation. I happen to agree with him. - But why? - Because I think it's a good idea for us to not be here this year. Now, we're leaving on Sunday. - Daddy, but my friends are here. - Well, you can make new friends in Colorado. And there's lots of snow. - Santa's here. - He's there too. Santa Claus is like Christmas itself. In spirit, in giving, he's everywhere. - How will Santa know we're in Colorado? - Well, you could write to him, tell him where you are. I've told you about the small town where I grew up. - Grainville, Nebraska. - It's probably a lot like the small town we'll be visiting. Christmastime in Grainville, there was lots of snow and open spaces. Every kid in town had a sled, every kid. On Christmas Eve, the whole town would gather at the town square. We'd hold hands, sing Christmas carols. It was wonderful. Alex, I'd give anything for both of us to have your mother back. And I'm as angry as you that we lost her. I know that I've given my life to my work this year and I'll make that up to you. - Promise? - Starting with this Christmas. Good night, darling. God bless you. - This Christmas, I'll have you all to myself. (dramatic music) - Hi, Merry Christmas.

Have you got your letter ready for Santa yet? - Not yet. - You better hurry, there's not much time left. - Hold on. This is a U.S. post office? - Yes, it is. - You're open for business? - Every year on Letter Day. - This is a letter. - (chuckles) Yes, but it is not a letter to Santa Claus. - I must be missing some, this is a U.S. Federal post office, and you're open for business, accepting mail. - Yeah, but only letters to Santa Claus. - Because it's Letter Day. - That's right. Um, now, if you don't mind, there are some people-- - I suppose the next thing you're gonna tell me, is this Letter Day of yours is a national holiday. - [Susan] Well, yes, it is our holiday. - [George] I have a letter that I want to mail. - But it is not to Santa Claus. Next, do you mind? Please. - Well as a matter of fact, I do mind, excuse me. I'm still at the head of this line. - Not for long. Look, if this letter is so important to you, I strongly suggest you march over there to that mail slot and deposit it. It will be picked up tomorrow and delivered to New York City in its own sweet time. This is Sunday. This is Letter Day. And we are not open to anyone like you. - [Child] Finally. - [Child] Come on. - [Child] Here you go, Ms. McMillan. - [Woman] There you go. - Hi, Matthew. - That looks pretty good, Howard, and your wings are straight (chuckles).

Together, we own the hotel. - Miss Sawyer, may we-- - Oh please, everybody calls me Hennie. - I already told them about lighting the tree tonight. - Oh, can Daddy and I help you with your tree? - Provided you've written your letter to Santa Claus. - I'll do that right now. - [Hennie] All right (laughs). - Just a minute. Upstairs, Room 210, follow me. - And tomorrow I'll fit you up in a shepherd's robe. - Uh, we won't be here for Christmas. - We're short on shepherds this year. All right, come on. Come on, get out of your costumes everybody, and don't forget we're gonna practice tomorrow. Three o'clock sharp. Come on, I gotta get you signed in. - You know, I get the distinct impression that just about everybody here in Georgetown believes in Santa Claus. - Oh, goodness, yes. Don't you, Mr. Billings? - George, please. - Well, George, tonight you're gonna find out why we believe. I'd best get out to the kitchen. Supper's at six o'clock. (gentle music) - Dear Santa. - Since you folks won't be staying till Christmas, Hank Huckle down at the service station said he'd be happy to take you to the airport. - That's very thoughtful, Bud, thanks. - Of course, if you were staying till Christmas-- - Your cab would have a brand-new motor. (Bud chuckles) - Well, secrets, Alex. You'll see at the tree lighting. (chair scraps) - I think what Bud is saying is that he's asked for a new motor from you-know-who. - A very tall order. (Bud humming) - [Bud] Oh, hi, Susan. - Oh Bud, I'm so sorry to hear about your cab. - It's all taken care of. - Aunt Hennie, can't we get Scruff back into the pageant? - The boy turned me down in no uncertain terms. Orders of his father. He's here (laughs) - Who's here? - A man. He's cute too. And he's a widower. Come on. - Aunt Hennie. - I insist, I insist. You two have got to meet. Susan McMillan, meet George Billings and his daughter, Alex. All the way from New York City. - Uh, we've already met. - I didn't know you'd been to New York City, Susan. Well, sit right down then. Get yourselves reacquainted. New York City, my. (both chuckling) - Uh. - That's my daughter, Alex. - Hello again. - I wrote my letter. - Good. Make sure you get it to the post office first thing in the morning. - I will. - You know, I'm afraid I wasn't your most hospitable welcome to Georgetown today. I would like to apologize. - There are long lines everywhere this time of year, especially in the post office. Especially on Letter Day. - Excuse me, Mr. Billings, oh, George, telephone. - Excuse me. - Mr. Renfield, I'll bet. - Alex, you know how he is. - Look, how about if I meet you two out by the tree? - Alex, why don't you go with Susan, and I'll meet you out there? - Well, that's a nice idea. - Susan, running the post office as you do, perhaps you know someone who can show Alex and I around Georgetown tomorrow. - Yeah, I'm sure I can arrange it. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Hello. - George. George, how are things going out west, George? - Fine, just fine, Mr. Renfield. You know, Georgetown is a picture postcard, just like you said it'd be. - Well, now that you've seen it, what do you think? - Well, it's a little early to say, Mr. Renfield. Uh, I got the pictures you wanted, but, you see, today when we arrived, it was Letter Day. The whole town was at the post office mailing letters to, uh, Santa Claus. - Santa Claus? - Everyone I've met believes in Santa Claus. It has to do with some legend. - Legend? - Well, I'll find out more tonight when we light the tree. - Tree? - [George] The town Christmas tree. Look, I'll call you tomorrow, Mr. Renfield. - George, no, no, I'll call you. I want the report tomorrow, George. Tomorrow. (phone clatters) (dramatic music) - Once again, good friends and neighbors-- - And a special greeting to our friends from New York. (crowd applauding) - We are gathered to honor the memory of our forefathers, and to recall the legend that has allowed Georgetown to grow and prosper. - 100 years ago, while crossing the Rockies, our forefathers were caught in a blizzard. It was the week before Christmas and they were stranded. - [Clara] The snow was so deep, they could not go forward and there was no way to turn back. They faced certain starvation. - Then, on Christmas Eve, a stranger appeared. A man with a long white beard, lost and alone in the mountains. - The stranger, near starvation, asked for food. But the people, nearing starvation themselves, said they had no food to give him. One little boy took pity on the stranger. - Yes, and that night, that little boy went through every wagon. He gathered up just a little bit of food, which he then took back to that stranger. - The stranger, for the little boy's charity and kindness, promised to reward him a hundred times over. And then, the stranger with the long white beard disappeared forever into the mountains. - [Hank] And on Christmas morning, every wagon was filled up with food, warm blankets and wonderful handmade toys for the kiddies. And there was a trail, it led up to a spring in a beautiful valley. - The little boy who had befriended the stranger knew who that man was. - [All] Santa Claus! - And tonight, we gather to honor that little boy's faith and his Christmas charity.

Just up near the top of that hill. That's where the legend began. And as the story goes, the legend is one day going to repeat itself. - How? - Well, it's just like the old man, the stranger with the long white beard. Another Christmas miracle is one day going to save the town. - What kind of miracle? - (chuckles) Well, legends are very careful not to reveal their secrets, Alex. (gentle music) Thanks. What kind of work do you do, George? - He's an architect. - Your all-around, everyday architect. - Condos, shopping centers and golf courses. Last year, a ski resort in Vermont. - Oh, I see. - But not here. You see, Mr. Renfield told Daddy to take a vacation because my mom died at Christmas last year. - I'm sorry. - So we thought it'd be best not to be home this Christmas. (light hearted music) What a beautiful valley. - It belongs to Jake Richards, or at least it did. (light hearted music) - [George] Whoa, girl. Whoa now. - So you're really gonna do it? - Well, uh, what other choice did I have, Susan? - Uh, George Billings and his daughter, Alex. This is Bob Truesdale, our mayor and banker. - Hi. - How do you do? - Nice to meet you. I saw you at the tree ceremony last night. Welcome to Georgetown. - How soon will Jake and the kids have to move? - As soon as the bank finds a buyer, Susan. - So, what brings you and your daughter to Georgetown, Mr. Billings? - Vacation mostly. - Well, if there's anything any of us can do to make your stay more pleasant, just let us know. - Come on, girl. (bells jingling) - Well, here we go, three cups of hot chocolate. One for you. - Thank you. - You're welcome. And one for you. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - All yours? - Yeah, I even manage to sell a few to the summer visitors. - You really have quite an eye for the landscape. - I think it happens when you're born and raised here. - Have you lived here all your life? - Just about. I did live in Denver for about 10 years. - What brought you home? - My dad died about two years ago. I came home to close and sell the house. - And you never went back? - Actually, I did go back. And I realized I just couldn't live that life anymore. So I came back to Georgetown, my house hadn't sold, and my father had been the postmaster. They offered me his job. So here I am. - At home and in love with the unspoiled land. - Yeah, as long as we can keep it that way. - You mean, as long as you can keep the banks from selling it. - Your business, according to Alex, is change, not mine. - Grainville, Nebraska, where I come from, is not on a map anymore because it wouldn't change. - That's your town. - Look, some people wanted to build a shopping center midway between Grainville and four other communities, and now my town is history. - Yes, but that is your history. - Uh, can we go on another sleigh ride? - Well, I think that's up to your father. - Well, I'm sure we'd love to, if there's time. - You're the one on the clock. - Come on, Alex. It's time for pageant practice. - Thanks for today, Susan. - Well, you're welcome. Listen, you get your daddy to say the word, and you can have another sleigh ride anytime. - Oh, thanks. - The hot chocolate was terrific. - Well, I'm glad you liked it. - We promised Aunt Hennie we wouldn't be late. - Uh, thanks for showing us around. - You're welcome. - I hear there's a dance in town tonight. - Yeah, that's what I hear. - I hope I see you there. - All right now, children, I want everybody to play like this is the night of the pageant. All right now. Suzie, you start. - And in that region, there were shepherds out in the field-- (children laughing) - Excuse me, Kathy. Here, here, boys, stop that pushing. Now, the next boy who pushes is going to be out of the pageant entirely. I know those beards tickle, but you have to get used to it. (children laughing) I don't see anything very funny. Go on, Suzie. Start again. - Kathy. - What? - Kathy. - Oh, yes, Kathy, go on. - And in that region, there were shepherds out in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night. And an angel of the Lord appeared to them, and they were filled with fear. And the angel said to them. - Do not be afraid. - Go on, Grover. We only have two more days, dear. Now go on, you can do it, go on. - For behold, I bring you good news. - For behold, I bring you news, good news. - Good. All right, children, that's all for today. (people chattering) Now quietly, please. Quietly, remember, you're in church. - [Child] Wait for me. - [Child] I wanna go too. - [Child] Hey wait. - [Child] Okay, let's go. - Oh, Alex. - Yes, Aunt Hennie. - Thank you for helping Grover. - Oh, I was an angel once, in nursery school. - Well, poor Grover. You know, he's so anxious to get his angel wings, but he's gonna need a little more help, I think. - He'll remember his lines. Bye, Aunt Hennie. (gentle music) (paper crackling) - I'll get Alex's present out by air express to Georgetown tonight, Mr. Billings. And a merry Christmas to you. I'll transfer you to Mr. Renfield. - [Thomas] George, we've been waiting for your call. - Mr. Renfield, I've done everything you asked me to do. - [Thomas] Let's have your report. - Well, Georgetown is everything and more of what you said it would be. Why, the countryside couldn't be more beautiful if you painted it. I've done the preliminary sketches for the potential of a large parcel of land that the bank is foreclosing on. - That's it! You've given me a great starting point. - Mr. Renfield, I'm not finished. There are other towns, Mr. Renfield. - I want Georgetown. - I want you to leave this town alone. - I'll have Georgetown. - [George] I said, there are other towns. - George, come off it. All these legends and Santa Claus are getting to you. It may be Christmas, but I'm not giving away Georgetown. In fact, I'm putting it under my tree. George, I want you to call a town meeting for tomorrow night. - Mr. Renfield, I'm an architect. It is my professional opinion-- - I didn't ask your opinion. I want you to set a meeting with the town for tomorrow night. - It is my recommendation that you leave Georgetown the way it is. - That's for me to decide, George. Your job's done there.

Why do you have to move? - My pa's losing his ranch. - Why? Wait! (door thuds) Wait. I just wanted to talk to you. Wait! Please. (upbeat music) (people chattering) - There you are. - Hi. - Where have you been? - Outside. We're all going sledding tomorrow. - Wonderful. - You wanna come with us? - Well, I might just like to do that. Listen, I'm gonna walk Susan home. Do you mind? - No. - I'll be right back. - Okay. - Bye. - Bye. - Goodbye. - Goodnight Alex. (Susan laughing) - Is this town always so friendly? - Well, we're not always on such good behavior. We've got our petty disagreements and real disappointments. Nobody wanted to see Jake Richards lose that ranch. You know, sometimes when I look at Bud's old cab, or I hear it sputter and clatter down the street, I think of this place, our town, my town. That which is old and good, that which thinks, perhaps, it'll go on forever. You know, a bunch of us are hoping to, uh, rebuild the grammar school, turn it into a summer theater. - [George] A theater? - Yeah. - I've never designed a theater. It might be fun. I guess a lot of fellas would have liked you to stay in Denver. - Well, there were some. Several. - Not a single one who followed you up here? - (laughs) No, not a one. - You sorry about that? - Sometimes. - I suppose if the right fella came along, you might follow him somewhere else, huh? - Well, he hasn't come along yet. - Back in Grainville, a fella walked a girl home, the whole town knew she was something special. - I remember him, George Billings. He always wanted to be an architect. Moved away to New York City. - Of course, in Grainville, if a girl let a fella walk her home, he was special too. (gentle music) (both chuckling) Guess there's still magic in walking a girl home. Good night, Ms. McMillan. - You know, it takes two to make magic. (gentle music) Good night, Mr. Billings. (gentle music) (door thuds) - To tell you the truth, it's like I was a little kid again, celebrating an old-fashioned Christmas, the kind I never dreamed I'd have again. - Are we staying here for Christmas? - Well, if that meets with your approval. - Will Santa know we're staying? - Well, you did write him a letter and tell him where we were, didn't you? - True. Did Susan ask you to stay too? - Susan said that she thought you'd like to stay. - Susan likes you. - You think so, huh? - (giggles) I do, a lot, I think. - Not as much as I like you. Good night, darling. - Daddy? - [George] Mm? - Could you ever be in love again? - I don't know. ♪ I didn't think it could happen again ♪ ♪ I'm just too old, set in my ways ♪ ♪ I was convinced I would always be lonely ♪ ♪ All of the rest of my days ♪ ♪ Maybe I gave up on romance ♪ ♪ In my longing to give up the pain ♪ ♪ I just didn't believe I would ever love again ♪ ♪ I was like one who had shut myself in ♪ ♪ Closed the windows and locked all the doors ♪ ♪ Afraid of the dark and the beat of my heart ♪ ♪ Yet knowing there had to be more ♪ ♪ Though it sounds like a great contradiction ♪ ♪ It's the easiest thing to explain ♪ ♪ You see, I was afraid I might never love again ♪ ♪ What does it take for a blind man to see ♪ ♪ When there's more there than just meets the eye ♪ ♪ What are the ways that the magic comes in ♪ ♪ That can turn a song into a sigh ♪ ♪ Sometimes I think that I'm dreaming ♪ ♪ Maybe I'm going insane ♪ ♪ Maybe it's just that I'm falling in love again ♪ Good night, sweetheart. - Good night, Daddy. - God bless you. (gentle music) (door thuds) (children chattering) (children laughing) - Got it? - I got it. Right here. - Right there. - You got it? - Yeah. - You on? - Yeah. - Yes. - Ready? (children laughing) Whoa! - Get on. - I've never been on a horse before. - Just grab my hand and swing up. - [Alex] Where will we go? - [Scruff] I'll tell you when we get there. (gentle music) - And so I told them Denver fellas, I don't care if you have to get it here by reindeer, we have to have it by Christmas Eve. - Howdy. - Howdy. - Howsy. - I also told them, as mayor of Georgetown, this is a civic emergency. (everyone laughs) - You see, every Christmas, Bud Sawyer asks Santa for socks or candy. Well, this year, we're certain he's asked for a new motor for that cab of his. - And you guys aim to be sure that Santa delivers. - And on time. - Sounds to me like Santa's got quite a few helpers around here. - Anything I can help you with? - Well, yeah, I'd like to borrow or rent a car. - What for? - Well, I'd like to go out to the Richards' Ranch. - All right, I'm, I just happen to be going out that way. You're welcome to come along. - Thanks. So, you work for Renfield. - How did you know? - I told Hank and the boys. I, uh, I talked to your boss on the phone this morning. He's a pretty persuasive man. - So he's buying the Richards' Ranch? - Well, isn't that why you came out to Georgetown, Mr. Billings? I think you better call me Bob. Looks like we're gonna be in business together. Doesn't it? (gentle music) - Aren't you gonna get down? - You have to help me. (gentle music) What is this place? - This is my hideout. No one knows about it. It used to be an old miner's cabin. - Down over there, that's where the legend comes from. - How'd you know that? - Susan, she took Daddy and I down there, in a sleigh. - You like her? - Oh, I do. So does my dad. - She's okay, I guess. Makes a big deal out of letters to Santa. You know what? That's all they are too, just letters. - I wrote him one. Didn't you? - Sure, a lot of good that'll do me. - I believe in Santa. - What for? - Because it's part of the spirit of Christmas and giving. - Come here for a minute. This is a hawk and it's my favorite. You take it. - But it's your favorite. - I got plenty more. - But you won't be coming here anymore. - I'll find other hideouts. - If I lived here, I'd have a hideout too. (gentle music) (engine rumbles) (car doors banging) - Jake, well I'll get right to the point. I got a buyer for the place. They want you out the day after Christmas. - Him, he the buyer? - More or less, he works for the man who bought it from back East. - Figures. Him and his kind are gonna change this valley for good. - Well, that's what his boss said. Yeah, they're gonna build condominiums and ski lodges, tennis courts, like that. - Well, I'm just as glad I won't be around to see it. - Jake, Jake, I'm gonna have to put the sold sign up. I'm sorry. - Jake, I had no idea my boss bought this place. - If he hadn't bought it, somebody else would have. - Listen, I came here to ask you to come to a town meeting tonight. I'd like to help you fight this thing. - You're wasting your time, mister. Besides, I wouldn't come to your meeting. I'm just glad to be out of my misery. - You worked your whole life to own this land. - It only took me two years to go belly up. That makes me one of the lucky ones. You ask the banker, he'll tell you. There's others all over this country, been in the land all their lives, just like their grandfathers and their great-grandfathers before them. Hell, man, I'm only losing land. They're losing family. (people chattering) (gentle music) - Truesdale. - Mr. Renfield. - Let's talk. - Right, let's talk. (gentle music) - Scruff said the hawk was his favorite. (paper rustling) See? - Well, this is very good. How old is he? - 11, 12 next month. - [George] You two learned a lot about each other, didn't you? - Yep. - Let's talk about your Christmas. - How can Grover's dad take away the ranch? - It's the law, Alex. - But Scruff loves his ranch. - The law is the law. If we didn't make the payments on our apartment in New York City, they'd do the same thing to us. We'd be out on the street. Listen, now tomorrow's Christmas Eve and I need to know a lot more about your Christmas list. - Oh, I did ask Santa for what I've always wanted, a dollhouse but I've changed my mind. - Changed your mind? Why? - Scruff. - Well, what's Scruff got to do with Christmas? - Everything. I want Scruff and his family to keep their ranch. That's the very best present Santa could give me. (dramatic music) - That's a pretty tall order. Mr. Renfield, you cannot buy this town, not these people. - Why? Because you say they believe in Santa Claus? - Well, yes, in part, but-- - I never knew you were such a sentimentalist, George. Sounds like you believe it too (scoffs). (gentle music) (people chattering) - Everybody, everybody. (Hank knocking) Hank, Tim, please. As mayor of Georgetown, I would like to introduce you to Thomas A. Renfield from New York City, who is going to speak to us tonight about the future of our town. Mr. Renfield. (crowd applauding) - Thank you, thank you, thank you. Mayor Truesdale, good citizens of Georgetown, Colorado. I've been reading in The Clear Creek Courant about the miracle of Christmas Eve. Now, as foreshadowed in that, that long ago, a new miracle has come to bring a new prosperity to Georgetown. Bringing with it a fresh new future, one of hope, happiness and ringing cash registers. - What Mr. Renfield is really saying is that he can-- - What I'm really saying is that George came out here and couldn't wait to call me with the good news. The countryside couldn't be more beautiful if you'd painted it, he said. - Now you're twisting the truth. - Then he got very excited when he told me about a beautiful and magnificent ranch, just outside your town, that was being foreclosed. Well, I couldn't wait to get on the phone with your banker, Mayor Truesdale. So now, because of my friend and business associate, George Billings, the paperwork has been set in motion for the Renfield Development Corporation to become the new miracle of Georgetown. And here is the check to prove it. - Just what kind of miracle do you and Mr. Billings expect to bring to Georgetown? - Prosperity. Prosperity! And lots of it! I'm too excited, I wanna show them this thing, come on. I have such faith in this project, if any of you have any doubts, I'll be willing to buy your establishments at a fair market value, keeping in mind that I could build my own town. - And what if we're not interested in selling? - What's your name? - My name is Susan McMillan. - Well, Susan, are you speaking for yourself or for these good people? - Well, I'm Bud Sawyer. Bud's Busy Bee Cab Company. I have a question. - Yes, Bud. - Do you believe in Santa Claus? - Oh, Bud, I'm sure there are many here tonight who believe that Santa Claus exists. I'm not here to take that away from you. But I am here to show you the miracle of your future. (paper crinkling) - Uh, Mr. Renfield. Mr. Renfield, the legend and the miracle of Georgetown have only to do with charity and giving, not with negotiations and contracts and buying and all that sort of thing. (crowd applauding) - Henrietta Sawyer, Bud Sawyer is my brother. I have my health, and I live very well in my old age, Mr. Renfield. I can't think of anything else I need. - Old age needs security, Ms. Sawyer. And the more people I can bring into your hotel, the more secure-- - If you wanna keep your hotel, Aunt Hennie, you gotta keep this man out of Georgetown. - George, I'm only here because of you. - Sir, sir, my name is Tim. I'm the town barber. - You brought this man here. - Susan. - You brought Alex here on a vacation? The only thing you ever intended was to steal our land. - What's that model got to do with us? Who thought that dumb thing up anyways? - You lied to me. - Alex, that's not true! I never wanted them to come here. You've gotta believe me. - Ask yourselves one question. If you do not change, 100 years from now, will there still be a Georgetown? (people chattering) - Our first condominium units and patio homes will be opening in six months. So from now on, you've got a new friendly neighbor just up the road, me. Merry Christmas. (people chattering) - You didn't mean to hurt us, I know that. - It didn't work out that way though, Bud. - What counts is that you believe. - Now, just because of what happened here tonight, don't you stop believing. - I just sold your town out, Aunt Hennie. - Oh. - You're fired. - We were coming here just for us. He promised me Christmas, not work. I want my mommy back (crying). - Shh. (engine rumbles) - Alex. - No. No. - Alex! I can explain this. - I think your Mr. Renfield did all the explaining we need. (dramatic music) - Merry Christmas. (dramatic music) Aunt Hennie, have you seen Alex? - Not since the meeting when she ran out. Somebody said she was crying her eyes out. - She must be around here someplace. - Well, she's probably with Susan. - She was with Susan, but I saw her run back here to the hotel. - Well, she's got to be someplace close by. Oh, by the way, a package came for you, from New York. - Alex! Alex? Alex! (wind whistling) (Alex crying out) (doorbell rings) (George knocking) - Is Alex here? - No, isn't she at the hotel? - No, she didn't go back. - Well, maybe she's at the Truesdales', some of those kids are in the pageant with her. - I don't think she would do that without telling me. - You're right. Let me get my coat. (door bangs) (wind whistling) (Alex crying out) - Yeah, well, thanks. (phone clatters) I've called every child in this town who knows her. No one has seen her. - I just don't understand how she could be lost in Georgetown. - Unless she's hiding. - It's starting to blow pretty good out there. - Wait a second, that's it, a hideout. Who's that kid? Uh, Scruff. - Scruff Richards. - Come on. - I'll put in a call to the sheriff. (dramatic music) (wind whistling) (engine rumbles) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (wind whistling) (George knocking) - It's you again. - I'm looking for my daughter, Jake. She ran away. I think Scruff can help me. - Scruff? - Well, she said something about a hideout. Now I know that Scruff can help. - Scruff, what do you know about a hideout? - If she's there, I know I can find her. (dramatic music) (wind whistling) (suspenseful music) (Alex cries out) (wind whistling) (wood clattering) (Alex screams) (roof clattering) (wind whistling) (dramatic music) - [Scruff] This way. Over here. - [Susan] Stay close to me now. Look, there's some footprints up here. - [George] Alex! - [Susan] Alex? - [George] Alex! - [Susan] Alex! - [George] Alex! - [Susan] Hold on to my hand, Judith. Stay with me. Alex! (wind whistling) - [George] Alex! (dramatic music) - [Susan] Alex! (dramatic music) - Alex! Alex. Are you all right? - [Alex] Oh, Daddy. - [George] Oh baby. - [Alex] Daddy (crying). - [George] Oh. Oh, Alex. Scruff knew where to find you. He and his dad helped me find you. Oh, Alex. It's all right, baby. It's all right. (people chattering) - Hank, bad news. - How bad? - I'm gonna tell you how bad. They can't locate an engine for Bud's car. - I don't believe it. - You're gonna believe it. We called as far as Detroit. They can't find an engine that old. Am I lying, Tim? - No, no. It's true. - This isn't bad news, this is the worst. - You better believe it. - I don't know what to do. - Wish you could see Bud downstairs. 'Twas the morning before Christmas and all through the house, he just can't stand this waiting. (Alex laughs) - Does Bud really believe in Santa? - Of course he does. - And do you believe in Santa Claus, Aunt Hennie? - Well, there have been times when I thought I heard the crack of that whip and the jingle of those bells. I'd hate to lose that. (person knocking) - Hiya, Scruff. I don't know if you know it, pal, you're the town hero today. - [Hennie] You sure are. Come on in, Scruff. (gentle music) (door thuds) - The doctor said I was very lucky. - I just came to say goodbye. - Where will you go? - My mom was waitressing in the next town to help pay some bills. Probably go get her and go down the road from there. - I asked Santa to let you keep your ranch. - So did I. I put it in my letter too. - My dad's sorry he ever told his boss about Georgetown. He got fired because of it. - I think I'll be going now. - If we both lived here, we could be best friends. I could learn to ride a horse (sighs). - Bye, Alex. Take care. - (sighs) You too, you too. (gentle music) (doorbell rings) - Me again. - Come on in. - [George] Thanks. (door thuds) - Coffee's hot. - Look, Susan, I, you're gonna think I'm crazy. I came here needing a new start for Alex and myself. I found a lot more than I expected. - You can say that again. - No, I don't mean about my work for Renfield. Look, this is a town where people care about each other, where they're willing to help each other out. Listen, what I'm trying to say is I'd like to find a way for Jake and his family to be able to keep their ranch. - How? - Oh, I don't know. But I do know that a year from now, Renfield will have this town surrounded, and if you don't sell out or start doing things his way, this place will end up just exactly like Grainville. - We have never been a town that had to fight for our existence. We're friends and neighbors, living here, most of us, all our lives, trusting and believing-- - In legends and miracles. - Yes, in legends and miracles. - Well, they're not gonna help us now. Now I've gotta stop this man. I've got to. And I'm going to tonight. - And an angel of the Lord appeared to them and they were filled with fear. And the angel said to them. - Be not afraid, for behold, I bring you good news of great joy. - Which will come to all the people. - Which will come to all the people, for to you is born this day in the city of David a savior, who is Christ the Lord. And this will be a sign to you, you will find a babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manager. - Let us go over to Bethlehem to see this thing that has happened, that the Lord has made known to us. - [Child] Where is he who has been born King of the Jews? We have seen his star in the east and have come to worship him. ♪ Oh little town of Bethlehem ♪ ♪ How still we see thee lie ♪ ♪ Above thy deep And dreamless sleep ♪ ♪ The silent stars go by ♪ ♪ Yet in thy dark streets shineth the everlasting light ♪ ♪ The hopes and fears of all the years ♪ ♪ Are met in thee tonight ♪ ♪ For Christ is born of Mary ♪ ♪ And gathered all above ♪ ♪ While mortals sleep the angels keep ♪ ♪ Their watch of wondering love ♪ ♪ Oh morning stars together ♪ ♪ Proclaim the holy birth ♪ ♪ And praises sing to God the king ♪ ♪ And peace to men on Earth ♪ ♪ Amen ♪ - Tonight, I've had a request, a request from George Billings, that he be allowed to speak to you. In fact, I think so much of what George Billings is about to say, I'm giving over my time this Christmas Eve to let you hear it. George. - Thank you, Reverend Ellsworth. (door clatters) (people chattering) - For those of you whom I haven't met, my name is George Billings. My daughter and I have been part of your town for only a few days. I wanted to speak to you tonight as someone who's lost something, more than once. A year ago this Christmas, my wife died. Last night, I lost my job. Almost lost my little girl. I once had a hometown too. It was a lot like your town. I went away, left, and when I returned, it was gone, deserted. A victim of Renfield's kind of progress. If Mr. Renfield moves in here, you're all gonna lose. Everything that Georgetown stands for, trusts and believes in will be gone. Now, I know some of you think that I'm to blame for all this happening in the first place. And I am at fault. I didn't come here as a tourist, bringing my daughter for a little vacation. I came to see what the pickings were. But then I started meeting the people of Georgetown. Aunt Hennie, Bud, Hank and Clara, Mayor Truesdale, a young woman named Susan McMillan, a fellow named Jake Richards. A hundred years of blessings have come and gone. And now Georgetown faces the kind of change that could destroy forever the way of life that you cherish. You've prided yourselves on making your lives a living example of Christmas, 365 days a year. Are you gonna give that up? I see Bob Truesdale there. I know he'd love to find a way to not have to sell the Richards' Ranch. I'm saying that Jake Richards is a neighbor and a friend. Last night in the snow, he and his son saved my daughter's life. Now there's got to be a way to help Jake and his family. And at the same time say no to Renfield Development Corporation. Tonight we have the chance to be like that small boy a century ago who found food enough to help a stranger. Now there's a way to help Jake and his family. If each of you were to go to Bob Truesdale at his bank and tell him you'll put up your home and your business as collateral to pay off what Jake owes, you can give the Richards family not just a second mortgage, but a second life. And I'm not asking any of you anything more than I'm asking myself. I've got some savings and I'll give everything that I can to be sure that Jake and his family get that second chance. That's all I've gotta say. Thank you. - Well, um, as soon as it starts running again, I'll put up the Busy Bee Cab Company. - And the hotel. - And the Huckle service station and grocery. That okay, Clara? - Of course, and the newspaper. - [Man] You can have the barbershop. - And my house and the bank. (congregation applauding) (gentle music) - Traditionally, we all go outside, light a candle and gather at the tree for a final hymn. Tonight, I propose we go to the Richards' home, light a candle and wish our neighbors a Merry Christmas and the happiest of New Year's. (gentle music) (congregation applauding) - Mr. Renfield, (paper tears) Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. - George, I was only kidding when I fired you. - Well, I'm not kidding. I may just stick around here. Goodbye, Mr. Renfield. (holiday music) (people chattering) - Jake, Scruff, Judith. Your neighbors are here with a very special gift for you this Christmas Eve. - The people of Georgetown want you and your family to stay, Jake. - As of this Christmas Eve, everything you owed at the bank has been paid off. - That's these people's gift to you. - I don't know what to say, uh. ♪ Silent night, holy night ♪ ♪ All is calm, all is bright ♪ ♪ Round yon virgin, mother and child ♪ ♪ Holy infant so tender and mild ♪ ♪ Sleep in heavenly peace, sleep in heavenly peace ♪ - Merry Christmas, friend. - [All] Merry Christmas Jake! - [All] Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. (paper rustling) - [Child] Oh, it's just what I wanted. - Oh, Daddy. - Oh, Alex (laughs) - It's beautiful. - Oh, I guess you got your letter in just in time. - Santa gave me twice what I wanted. - [George] I love you. - I love you. - Merry Christmas, Aunt Hennie. - Merry Christmas, George. - Would you look at this. - Look, flowers. - Flowers in the vase. - Look. - I asked for a new coat, hat, new shoes. - Well, as usual, I think I own more ties than anyone else in town. - I've got me a year's supply of Bay Rum. (horn honking) - Oh. - Hey, fellas, can you hear it? It's just what I asked for. See you later, fellas. (engine rumbles) - Don't look at me. I didn't have anything to do with it. - Not me. - Me neither. (engine rumbles) - George, Alex, come on. Hurry up, you're gonna miss it. (people cheering) (holiday music) (horn honking) - Bud, it's working, it's working! - Well, I guess I know what you asked Santa for for Christmas. - (laughing) No complaints (laughing). - I gave him the cap and the new glasses. (both laughing) - Any time you and Alex are ready to check out, the Busy Bee Cab Company is at your service. (bells jingling) (horse neighs) (bells jingling) - Well, I believe I promised somebody another sleigh ride. - Oh, boy. Oh, thank you. - Mm, Merry Christmas, Alex. - Merry Christmas. - You're welcome to come along too. - Well, Bud, I appreciate the offer for that ride, maybe Alex and I will stay for a while. - I knew it all the time. - Well, it's a long way from the big city. - But it's a little bit closer to home. (gentle music) - I already know my wish for next year. - Giddap. Giddap. Let's go. - [Man] Bye. - [Man] Merry Christmas. - [Man] Bye. (light hearted music) - Oh, boy. (horn honking) - Bye. - [Bud] Merry Christmas. (people chattering) - [Susan] Merry Christmas. - [Man] Bye. (horn honking) (light hearted music)
