Subtitles by explosiveskull Libby. Libby. Libby. You did amazing work. I knew I could count on you. Peace or terror! What a morning. Students, welcome to Course number 422, cap 23 Understanding Contemporary Warfare. I apologize for the hullabaloo you may have encountered entering the building but it was a one-off, I can assure you. As you may or may not be aware Professor Shimka, who was scheduled to teach this course suffered a heart attack some weeks back. In his stead, we are honored to have secured the services and talents of one of the most brilliant and innovative minds in American foreign policy today, Elizabeth Lamm. Elizabeth received her BA from Princeton and her Ph.D. from the University of Chicago. Fluent in French, Japanese, Pashtu.. Winter break, I'm getting the left hip replaced. End of the school year, the right one. Already, I've had both knees worked on. I have the best orthopedic guy, if you're ever in need. - Not yet, anyway. - Willa? Oh, how did it go? How crazy was it? Were arrests made? Campus cops handled it with aplomb a very pleasant surprise. Wouldn't you agree, Elizabeth? Yes, security was excellent. Gracious, my manners. Everything's moved so fast I forget you've only just arrived. Elizabeth, this is Dee. Elizabeth. Without Dee, the office would come to a grinding and very messy halt. Whatever you need, just let us know. Thank you. I will. Martin! There he is, my phantom roommate the international man of mystery. - Jordan. - Where you've been? Like, I know we've only known each other a short time, but I worry. It's my nature, right? I'm like my Jewish grandmother that way. Just, uh, just shoot me a text, or something. "Great seeing you too, Jordan." Thanks for givin' a shit. You're right, I could've fallen in a lake and drowned. - No one would ever have known. - Thank you. Hey, any time, roomie. And this is you. I'm afraid it's rather Spartan in terms of creature comforts. It's perfect, actually. Well, it may not be Foggy Bottom but welcome to academia. Once everyone gets to know you, Elizabeth I think you'll find we have a good bunch of folks here. Hearts are in the right place. It's fine. I'm used to it. Really. October 21st, 1805 Napoleon's Navy, under the command of Admiral Pierre de Villenueve is wiped out by the British Fleet under the command of Admiral Horatio Nelson. This engagement, known as the Battle of Trafalgar establishes Britain's dominance of the high seas for the century to come. Surprisingly, such a stinging defeat does little to deter Napoleon. If anything, his obsession with crossing the Channel only grows after Trafalgar. - Am I interrupting? - Not at all. Couple of housekeeping matters. Would you prefer using your own email for correspondence? Or I can set you up with a department address? Neither. I'm old school that way. - Really? - Really. - I prefer hard copies. - Okay. Can I have your cell number for the office? Don't have one. You don't have a cell phone? No, I don't. Home phone number. Sorry. Well, how do you communicate with the world? Slowly. It's all so close, isn't it? The pieces, the stars they are aligning. What a view you have here. Majestic. The entire compound is just breathtaking. Thank you. It's been in my family for generations. I don't really like the lake. Too many bugs, water's too cold, no sand. I know, right? Poor me. You're having doubts. By that definition, the US military uses WMDs every day and theoretically could be prosecuted by foreign governments if they were to adopt a similar law. For example, the N67 hand grenade is a fragmentation device with an explosive charge of 6.5 ounces. So, it qualifies as a WMD on two counts. Dannisha? When you say "Prosecuted by foreign governments" you mean prosecuted as war criminals. That exact definition, that wording I believe, is a matter for the courts to decide. Does a figure this polarizing earn the right to be given a platform like this just for her notoriety? Some will say yes, uh, some will say no. Some will say she shouldn't even be walking free. But you have to look to the GU administration for the real reason behind this. Money. - Oh, fuck. - What the fuck? Now, Martin, you show up now? Just leavin'. What, hold, we can go in my room. You don't have to... No, I'm out of here. Thanks. What was he doing in the dark like that? This is what I've been saying. I am concerned much of the analysis is unsubstantiated. Some will say it's all circumstantial. But that's nonsense. Do you think it's circumstantial? No, I do not. But wanting to believe something... Do you realize that Pearl Harbor to V-J Day was less than four years? A world at war, and we ended it.. ...just that quickly? This thing has been going on since the turn of the century. We have turned a side show into the main event. But the response has to be specific, surgical. I do think we need to take into account the reactions, both at home and abroad. Doesn't it bother you that the idea of American exceptionalism is an anachronism? Of course. We're a rudderless ship where just getting by is enough. And Los Angeles certainly showed how tenuous even that is. If Maleki's tire does not blow out if the CHP does not pull over if Maleki does not panic. If, if, if! An if prevented a catastrophe that would've made 9/11 look like a footnote. Now, I don't sleep well at night knowing that. We have to win this war. Total victory. Thanks for coming on such short notice. So you want all of these changed? Plus the mudroom and back door. I wanna add more locks there, too. A different key for each. Okay. You have a robbery? No. Not happy with your alarm system? No, it's fine. If you want cameras, I have a guy. No cameras. Thanks. I'll get to it. Sorry if I, uh, spooked you guys last night. - Is he... - No, Neal is gone. Hey, uh, if we want this roommate thing to work out we need to communicate a little bit better. - You know what I mean? - Uh, yeah. So if you have a problem with my bringing Neil back here... Uh, I don't, I don't have a problem with that. - Okay, so what is your problem? - I don't have a fucking.. I don't have a fucking problem. Look, Martin, we don't really know each other. I've got the sense you're one of those extremely gifted, self-motivated types. Your test scores, the Ivy League pedigree, the awards. Frankly a little intimidating, but I applaud all that, seriously. It's just the sneaking around that weirds me out a bit. Sneaking around? What the fuck does that mean? You just seem really unhappy. Maybe you should talk to someone. You know, if you want a new roommate you just go ahead and say it. That's not what I'm saying. Well, fuck it. Opt room for a single next semester. That's not what I'm saying. Hey, I get it, Jordan. It's what I'm saying. And the paper.. Is it good? Our circulation continues to dwindle. Last time I checked, uh, we had a grand total of 43,000 subscribers. The entire newsroom is comprised of an ever-dwindling 25, myself included. Dwindling being key word here. Can I help you? At least they didn't try to take a picture. So sorry, Mr. Lamm, just a couple of minutes and your table will be ready. Thank you very much. You were saying about the paper? Oh, th... tha... that's it, really. You know, sometimes I think that leaving the Post was the biggest mistake of my professional career. And then I remember I wasn't even given a choice in the matter. Daddy, I am so sorry if I had anything to do with you losing... That was not your fault. You know that. Even your mother has.. Does she know how I feel? She read your letters, yes. And she still refuses to see me. We were so proud of you. So proud of your accomplishments. Were. And now you're ashamed. We have to win this war. Total victory. Now, more than anyone you... have done more to prepare this country for this moment. So connect the dots that need to be connected. And if the stars need help aligning, do so. Talk to Adrian. The DI is with us on this. People wanna believe what you say. Use that gift. And if you see this through to its logical end your future, your legacy will be assured. You will have served your country honorably. Do you see it? Uh, found it. It's quite beautiful. Built in 1900 by the legendary J.D. McCarthy Safe and Lock Company out of Cincinnati. It's in excellent condition. The lock still works? You look awfully familiar. Have we met? No, I'm afraid not. Of course. Excuse me. I just wanna say thank you for your service to the country. You did what had to be done, and we're safer for it. Well, thank you. I'm glad you feel safe. Well, let's open this bad boy. Uh, a little help, please? Continuing our discussion of Clausewitz and war in 1832, he wrote "Kind-hearted people might, of course, think "there was some ingenious way to disarm or defeat the enemy "without too much bloodshed. "It might imagine this as the true goal of the art of war. "Pleasant as it sounds "it is a fallacy that must be exposed. "War is such a dangerous business "that mistakes that come from kindness are the very worst." Hey, Libby. It's good to see you. Adrian. - How late? - About three. Waiting for Amman to check in. I missed waking up to you this morning. Me, too. I guess I've become kind of used to it. Me, too. The Amman call. What you wanted to hear? No. What, the stars aren't aligning? Not funny. Did you tell Rachel? Nope. Are you waiting for the right moment? I don't think there is a right moment. She would like to see you. Thanks. As if on cue. Tonight. The paper trail has to be... Airtight. Commission-proof. This is not just any op, Adrian. I get it. We are way past cherry-picking evidence. Understood. Just think, we can end this thing once and for all. Hey, your boss wants it done, my boss wants it done. That's good enough for me. The intel has to be credible and actionable, especially on Vahdat. He is the key. I'll get you visas, travel itineraries, whatever we can provide. Now, put that pad away and get back over here. Can we talk... inside? No, not inside. Where, then? 'Cause I'm not leaving till we do. Follow me. Yeah? Hey, Martin, can I come in? Yeah. Hey. Yeah? Did you hear about Sunday? No, what about Sunday? Dr. Sipe is having a get-together at her house for faculty and department grad students. No, I didn't hear about that but, um, thanks for the heads-up. Do you think you'll go? Yeah, I do. I hate going to these things... alone. Would it be okay if we went together? Sure. Thank you. So what's with the no phone, no email kind of, but not really off the grid nonsense? Keeps it all very simple. I guess I should congratulate you on your appointment. Chief of staff to the President of the United States. How does it feel? It feels right. Well, I'm glad it all worked out for you. We're concerned about you, Libby. We've reached out several times. Reaching out in regard to the President's intent to run for re-election? And the silence is deafening. We need to make sure you're still part of our team. Are you, Libby, still part of our team? You flew all this way to hear me answer that question. I flew all this way to see you answer that question. I served faithfully. I did everything I was asked to do, everything. Back then. You don't.. - Does it ever give you... - No. A decision was made, an order was given. Period. Easy as that. Just the one thing. What happened to you and me, that did hurt. But, Libby, the understanding was you'd resign and we'd all say nice things about one another. Presidential medals of freedom and all that. I'm not asking you to be the centerpiece of the campaign. I'm just looking for a unified front. You may have detractors, but your overall favorable rating within the party is 70%. So when I do reach out and I hear nothing I take that as a "Fuck you." And being the trusting guy that I am I begin to think that maybe Libby's having second thoughts maybe Libby's thinking of airing the family's dirty laundry. I cannot overemphasize what a colossally dangerous idea that would be. Stop following me. I know you have people watching. I can assure you it's not coming from my office. How about your old buddies at Langley? Is that what's happening, Libby? Are you suspicious of everyone now? Like I said, tell your people to leave me alone. You're a very attractive woman, Libby. Sometimes the answer to a problem is a very simple explanation an obvious one. I'm here in good faith because of your service to the President and the country. Because Rachel still considers you a friend. I wouldn't be speaking here now if it was otherwise. So, I've been warned. Counseled. This memoir you threaten to write has Rachel worried. You're either with us or against us. It's as simple as that. Let's talk again... soon, okay? What now? - Mingle. - Beer first. And I'll join you if, uh, if that is okay. Jordan, I know I can be a first-class jerk. I don't want a single next semester you're a great roommate, and I think I can be a good one soon if that works for you. Does that mean I can join you for that beer? We're bonding. Then they removed the damaged cartilage and bone from the.. Now, here's my new word of the day, acetabulum. There's our new celebrity and resident. Elizabeth, so glad you made it. Let me make some introductions. I apologize for sounding like my parents but kids these days. No matter how incoherent, no matter how many typos they still expect an A. I'm talking about, about basic grammar middle school stuff. I don't know how the hell they expect an A when they can't even put a sentence together. For that matter, how the hell did they get into this university? I'm asking you. Washington in the summer? You can have it. The humidity, the mosquitos. Yuck. Oh, you get used to it. Enjoying the show? Ah, the glamorous Elizabeth Lamm. The architect of Total Victory and the Burke doctrine. Kill one of ours, we kill a thousand of yours. Ain't that the gist of it? Something like that, yeah. Hmm. Have you met her? Not yet. Introduce yourself. When the time's right. So how long are you here for? - The semester. - Hmm. And we'll see how it goes after that. Are you staying near campus or in the city with the action? Near campus. - Thank you. - Thank you. How about you? You doing the old meet-and-greet? Oh, yeah, a couple of "Hi, I'm Jordan Ritt. That's Ritt with two Ts. So thrilled to be taking your class." Excellent conversation, if I do say so myself. Congratulations on that. Yes, it is a fine art. Big homes in that area, though. It's a lot of house for one person. I like it. I like the space. Really? You don't find it too quiet, too lonely? Uh, no. Did you buy? - Rent. - Furnished? Almost. So what are you sleeping on? Did they, did they leave you a bed? Elizabeth, how often do you encounter protests these days? I mean, was Tuesday an anomaly or i... is it typical? Now, I promised Elizabeth there would be no grilling. No inquisition, not tonight. Willa, I'm just asking Elizabeth if every time she walks out into the world she has to deal with those haters. It's okay, Willa, really. I see it on campuses still. That's about it. I resigned my post four years ago. After that, I was a figure of controversy. Protests were common. People were upset. But as time went by, it receded and it was replaced by new controversies. Toynbee was right. History's just one damn thing after another. But some things are more damnable than... than others, aren't they, hm? What you did was unconscionable. Larry, not here. Willa, you should be ashamed. You bring this woman in? All you guys. Do you realize what we're legitimizing here? Larry, please. We are all aware that liquor brings out your unfulfilled penchant for theatrics. What the fuck does that even mean? It means you're stupid drunk. The only way I can stand to be around her. How many? Come on. You know the number. How many people? Based on the information that was available at the time... How many? There's always the unknown, the unkn... Say it!! Larry, drop this. Now. The Amman intel changes nothing. Two, maybe three of our guys, won't be there at least not during the window. Vahdat, what about Vahdat? Not confirmed. It changes nothing. But we stress that you're refutable. I mean, in and of itself, the evidence at hand is overwhelming. When we include the DI from intel, yes. But... But it's commission-proof, correct? Yes. Alright, good enough for me. I just want a moment alone with Elizabeth, please. There's one more thing. I've changed my mind. I'm recommending we now go with Directive 7-12. You were in agreement with the more conventional approach... It's a message that has to be sent. Libby, it's become clear to me that this is much bigger than Homs. We are sending a message to the world "Don't fuck with us anymore." The discussions with the DOD, they've all been about this... I, look, I've wrestled with it. I'm convinced the stars have aligned. I'm urging you to reconsider 7-10. The multiple drones... These people are like needles in a haystack. But to burn down the entire barn.. When the moment comes, you will know what to do. Good evening. Hey. The rabid release of energy in such an explosion creates a shockwave equivalent to several thousands pounds of pressure per square inch, enough to crush uh, brick houses and human lungs and most objects on earth. Thus, we see the increased incidents of leukemia and thyroid, lung, breast, and bone cancer... Excuse me, Luis, class, give me a minute, please. I'll be right back. What are you doing here? I told you, we were gonna finish our conversation. Now you're threatening me. I just want the answer to the question. Leave me alone. - Libby... - No! - No what? - No. I'm no longer on your fucking team! So we can't count on you. Count on me to tell the truth. What, then? Your memoir goes public and you're at peace? Why are you making this so hard on yourself? If you think you're in the wilderness now.. Sorry, everyone. I have to go. Class dismissed. We'll, we'll make it up. You say nothing and nothing changes. Put that down.. ...and move slowly away from the safe. Sit on the bed. Hands to your side, palms on the covers. You were following me. Can you not point the gun in my face? You are just a mother-fuckin' stalker. I would be within my right to shoot you dead here and now. No, I'm not that kind of stalker. Bullshit. I'm not, Dr. Lamm. You were in my class and at Dr. Sipe's. Yes, I'm a graduate student. Were you sent here? Is someone paying you? Nope. Then you have one chance to answer this question correctly. If I don't like what I hear I'm either gonna kill you or call the cops. You don't have a phone. Why are you here? I'll put it this way. Say I'm a Jew. I'm not. Say I am. Now, as a child I learned my grandparents they were murdered in Auschwitz. What do I do? I immerse myself in the subject. All the camps, attending horrors. I study hard, I... I excel. Full tuition, scholarships. Getting into, you know, prestigious universities both graduate and undergraduate. Now, at said graduate university.. ...my first class, on my first day.. ...I look up and see Dr. Mengele standing at the lectern. For Dr. Mengele's been given an honorary chair in the political science department and will be lecturing me. You have family there? What you committed was an atrocity.. ...a crime against humanity. I.. We believed we were making the world a safer place. - Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. - We believed we were protecti... Shut up! You're a fuckin' war criminal and you should be hung as such. What's your name? My what? Martin. Martin Salhi. Okay, Martin Salhi. You have your Mengele. You're staring into the abyss. Now what? Do you wanna kill me? Nah. No. I, um.. ...I just wanna understand how evil works. Evil? Yeah. I wanna know everything. I wa.. Does it wear silk or... or eat off fine china? Does it drink latte? How does it take the unthinkable and... and make it real, you know? Does it have remorse? You know, how... how does it keep going? I wanna know the big questions I wanna... I wanna know the details. I wanna know everything. I wanna, I just wanna understand everything. Sit back down. Please... Martin. Sit back down. Read it. You wanna understand? Read it. All of it. Start there. Mr. President, because time is of the essence I've asked my National Security Affairs advisor Elizabeth Lamm, to address the group. Elizabeth has taken all the intel. Phone intercept, satellite, imagery, signals intelligence, and human assets. And I think you will agree that her findings are definitive and convincing necessitating immediate and total action.. ...if she may. Smartest person in the room. You bet. Elizabeth, please. Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen. We are currently presented with a moment in time in which a single, decisive act could literally change the course of history. The evidence and opportunity is undeniable. Omar al-Abadi, ISIL. Kamal Lateef, Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. Sajad al Jubeir, Jabhat al-Nusra. Mohdar al-Hazmi, Hezbollah. Khalid Saadu, Jaysh al-Sham. And Dr. S.Q. Vahdat former head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran. And quite possibly, the most dangerous man in the world. Unbeknownst to one another, these six men five leaders of terrorist organizations and Dr. Vahdat a rogue agent dedicated to the proliferation of nuclear weapons technology will all be in the same city Homs, Syria, at the same time this very evening. Excuse me, Elizabeth. Where is Homs, exactly? Approximately 162 kilometers north of Damascus. - And that's... - That's about 100 miles. Got it. Thank you. Never did get the damn metric system. Our best estimate is a four-hour overlap between 10:00 p.m. and 2:00 a.m. local time in which these known enemies will be within the city of Homs, all targets of opportunity. A strike to the heart of Homs at this moment would cripple if not terminate the threat of terrorism this country has faced for nearly three decades at the cost of thousands of lives and trillions of dollars. It is approximately 7:05 p.m. local time giving us just under five hours to approve and execute the action. And what type of strike are you proposing? Well, we prepared three scenarios, in which... Um, Elizabeth? Excuse me. I'm... I'm gonna interrupt. Ladies and gentlemen.. ...if we act now we can defeat these primeval bastards once and for all. Now, Elizabeth is gonna walk us through some scenarios but I am convinced.. ...that our response should be total and absolute. Elizabeth, if you would continue, please. Thank you, Madam Vice President. What the vice president and her staff are advocating is unprecedented. Whatever short-term gain this action might achieve we would be opening Pandora's Box. We become the pariah. May I remind the Admiral that the 7-12 calls for a tactical weapon. Tactical nuclear weapon. It has been the stated policy of this nation never to be the first to use a nuclear device in any conflict. That has been a doctrine since the end of the World War II. He has a point, Rachel. If you were president at this moment would you be willing to personally authorize a nuclear strike that would kill countless innocent men, women and children? Yes. The whole point of a deterrent is that our enemies need to know we are prepared to use it. They need to understand, we will punish their fathers and mothers, husbands and wives and children. Everyone... they love and cherish will be held accountable. Now, it's a different century. It's a different world. This war on terror is unique in terms of who the enemy is.. ...and how to combat that enemy. And if there is any doubt about the stakes need I remind everyone at this table about Los Angeles? Madam Vice President, there is no credible evidence that Maleki had any connection to Vahdat's group. That's your opinion. Mine, that Vahdat and these gangsters are committed to detonating a nuclear device in an American city in the next 24 months. They don't have that capability. Not yet! Mr. President, our window of opportunity is under three hours and there is nothing that I have heard at this table that refutes Elizabeth's analysis and evidence. In one fell swoop we can win this war and end this worldwide scourge. Elizabeth? Yes, Mr. President? Do you agree with the vice president's recommendation regarding the 7-12? Of course I do, Mr. President. And you're confident these six men will be at this place at this time? I am. Especially Dr. Vahdat? Yes, Mr. President. You know.. ...after I won my third championship at Texas.. ...people just kept asking me "Coach, what's the secret to winning?" And I would always tell them, "Commitment." Total commitment. So... let's go win this thing. Whiplash in one-zero. Roger, Tango-45. Whiplash in one-zero. Whiplash Once the initial reports are in I'll address the nation. - Thank you, everyone. - Thank you, Mr. President. Yep. Libby. I knew I could count on you. "Nuclear bombs dropped in the base of falsified intelligence?" These have to be published immediately. These go to one person first. They read it, they publish. No, no, no, why wait? It's very important to me this person is the one who publishes my story. Who else knows? On the outside? Just you, Martin. Does it make you feel safe? No. We should go out the back. There are elements within the White House an intelligence committee who will use every resource at their disposal to make sure these never see the light of day. What? So you're saying that's who's outside right now? The basement. I've got a way out. Hold up here for a minute. I have nothing on me. Um.. I've got a student ID about 65 bucks, a credit card, and about 4.50 in change. Your phone. - Oh, shit. - Leave it here. Let's go. Should we go to the cops or, or FBI? I mean, everyone can't be involved, right? This way. Why? The trees complicate satellite and drone surveillance. Low-tech can beat high-tech. Looking at it from their end, this needs to be a limited op. Surgical. Exposure can't be risked. Questions can't be asked. A snatch-and-grab on these streets in this town would be a last resort. So, hide in plain sight? As best as we can. We'll need money. This trouble you're in, you can't tell me any more about it? No. What, for, like, my protection or something? Really? I'm trying to right a wrong. If it wasn't important, really important, I wouldn't be here. Shit, Martin. You realize how bizarre this is? Please? How much do you need? Four hundred dollars. Um, yes, I can get that. Thank you, Jordan, okay? T... thank you. Uh, could you also swing by the room and get my laptop? Yeah. Maybe grab a sweater? Yeah. Anything else while we're at it? That's it. Promise. I take it you need all this as soon as... Right now works best, actually. Whatever it is you're doing here.. ...I hope it works out okay. Be safe. How do you know to get in and out like this? I make it my business to know every exit of every building I step foot in. You never know when some dickhead with a gun might open up. I used to think I was just being paranoid. I gotta show you something. What we're seeing.. ...is it now? No, yesterday. This is this morning. We leave, they enter. Oh, shit. No, don't. Door's open. Hey, are you guys finished in here 'cause we reserved the room, so.. Yep. Can you give us a minute? Uh, yeah, absolutely. Take your time. Thanks. Any ideas? - Regarding? - Where to go. Where to hide until morning. Uh, yeah, I've got one. We're taking the story to your father, right? Yes. He runs a newspaper downstate. He's the editor, yes. - What if he won't print it? - He'll print it, Martin. Okay, but, like, what if he can't? Honestly, I've.. I've been thinking about just grabbing the backpack and running. Dumping the story. Just getting it out. You've had opportunity. What's been stopping you? Because it's your story and I respect that. Your father, what's he like? He's a good man. Honest... and caring. It's what you want a dad to be. Yours? He was all that. He was there the 19th of June.. ...visiting his mother and father. Dutiful son. This never ends. Do you believe in the hereafter? Heaven? No. I do. And I know I'm gonna have to answer for what I've done. Martin... maybe you should go. Either I get to Springfield tomorrow or I don't. But I have a chance, thanks to you. My father's dead. Well, my mother she may as well be. She never recovered. These pages are important to you? Well, they're important to me too. Dr. Lamm? Hello, Libby. Madam President. I apologize. I think the team got a little overzealous. And, gentlemen, if you will excuse me I'd like a moment alone with Elizabeth. Oh, come on, Adrian, it'll be fine. Gentlemen, please. Go. Libby, I hope my just being here will convince you that what I'm about to say is the truth and it comes from my heart. Despite all that's happened and all that's been said I still consider you a friend, a dear friend. You served me and this country brilliantly. A service that I believe deserves to be recognized and honored. I was at a party recently and somebody reminded me of the number. Do you remember the number, Madam President? Of course I do. A hundred and fifty. One hundred and fifty thousand people died in Homs that night. I will always remember that number. You know the story, Libby. General Sherman in the Civil War. Mayor of Atlanta pleads with him to save his city. And the general says to the mayor just before he torches it, "War is cruel." War is cruelty. We were at war and we did what needed to be done and our country is safer for it. The stars aligned. We slayed the dragon and we won. If there is any victory here it has fallen on us. Libby, I offered you the position of Secretary of State four years ago and I am offering it to you again. Madam President, respectfully.. ...we ginned up the evidence and 150,000 innocent people were vaporized. Okay, so help me understand it. You were fine with drone strikes. Five innocents here, ten innocents there. What's the humane number? A hundred? A thousand? Ten thousand? Where do you draw the line? That bomb was dropped on a lie. I just can't live with that anymore. Tell me about your manuscript. And the young man. He's a good-looking boy. How's he involved? He's not. Leave him be. And the cameras in your house. - What's that about? - None of your business. I think I'm beginning to understand your dilemma. My dilemma? Libby, you're this close to being charged with sedition and treason. You don't know if there's a copy. And the obvious move would be to grab Martin when you grabbed me. He might be on the other side of that wall this very moment. That's the obvious move. That's not the Rachel Burke I know. No? So, what's the other response, then? Follow the money. Follow the boy to see if he leads you to that copy. The obvious downside to that approach is the more time allowed the greater the opportunity for unfortunate mischief. I'm sure Adrian voiced that concern. You are a unique talent, Libby. Unfortunately.. ...I don't see a very happy ending for Martin Salhi in either scenario unless you tell me right now if there's a copy and where I can find it. And then, you and I can come to an understanding and you can just fade away. All I can tell you is what I know. There's the original. A dozen notepads of material written in longhand. There is not a single copy. No hard copy, nor electronic. Leave Martin be. He is an innocent. Please, Rachel. Do with me what you will.. ...but let him be. How could you do this? You had regret. You wanted out. I agreed to everything. Everything! But for you to go and write this betrayal? 'Cause that's exactly what it is. It is a betrayal. A betrayal for you. A reckoning for me. Madam President, you are needed. What is it? There is a problem, we should go. I had to try. I mean, I owe her that much. Alright. So, tell me about Salhi. Well, they lost him in Union Station. Thirty seconds of confusion is about all it took. - How is that even possible? - He's a smart kid. He found the tracker and stashed it along with his laptop in a bag on a bus headed to Des Moines. I know we thought the boy would lead us to other copies but leaving the backpack was a mistake. We did go back and check the security videos. Salhi purchased a bus ticket to Springfield and we have him boarding that bus. - Pull your team. - That would be a mistake. The operation is blown. The pads are in a backpack, which can be easily taken when the bus arrives. It'll look like a simple mugging. No. It's already light in the Midwest. No. It's too risky. No. Madam President, there are people that don't want that document made public, ever. Like yourself. There will be no second term. You will be disgraced. I will take my chances with the American people. They remember what it was like before Homs. They remember the fear. Impeachment, followed by conviction. - Oh, it's not gonna happen. - I don't think... Look, Adrian, you work for me now. - Is that clear? - Yes, ma'am. The agency can more than handle its own affairs. Commission-proof intel is the phrase I remember. - This is dangerous. - Oh, we'll weather it. Stop it. What should we do with the boy? Let him go. I mean, he's the messenger. And Libby? Take her home. It'll be her word against ours. The American people won't want to refight a war that's already won. Did Adrian fly in with you guys? No. He stayed in California. Dr. Lamm, when your feet touch that ground start walking and count to 20. Only then remove the hood. Understood? Yes. I'm... I'm Martin Salhi. I'm here to see Phillip Lamm. You can say it's regarding his daughter, Elizabeth. Let me try him. Hey, Blair, would you let Phil know that Martin.. Salhi. There's a Martin Salhi here to see him. He's on his way down. Martin! - What the fuck happened to you? - You have to leave. What? Hey, what.. Daddy. Oh, no. - Where is she? - On the phone with the FBI. Okay, Fred. Yes, she was. Thanks. Just keep me posted. You know, about everything. Okay, thanks. Get out. Just putting the period on the sentence. I said, get out. Of course, she was a dear friend. I'll make that clear in the statement. As of now, there are 23 confirmed dead. Among those, Elizabeth Lamm former National Security Affairs Advisor to then, Vice President Burke and her father, Phillip Lamm executive editor of the Springfield Register the site of the attack. We are learning the FBI now believes that the primary suspect, Martin Salhi acted alone and specifically targeted Dr. Lamm for her role in the controversial strike on Homs, Syria, four years ago. Mr. Salhi had family in Homs. Dr. Lamm, known as the architect of recent US policy in the war on terror advocated what came to be known as Total Victory. President Burke has been on the West Coast this week attending various fundraising events. She is in San Francisco this afternoon ...Adrian Little, the President's chief of staff issued this statement concerning the attack. Good afternoon, everyone. President Burke is both saddened and stunned as we all are, by this vicious act of terror and the death of our colleague and good friend, Elizabeth Lamm. Jordan Ritt? FBI. Look, Martin wasn't the easiest person in the world to get along with, for sure but this just makes no sense. If what you're asking is, do I think Martin was capable of blowing himself up, murdering dozens of people my answer is no. I don't believe that. This is my apartment. Nobody told you? Excellent conversation, if I do say so myself. - Congratulations on that. - Yes, it is a fine art. Subtitles by explosiveskull
