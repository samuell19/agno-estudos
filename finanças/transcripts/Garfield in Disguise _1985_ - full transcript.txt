This could be the worst night of your lives. ﻿I knew it. Let's not bother the man ﻿any longer, Odie. Stay-y-y-y-y! What I'm about to tell you has never been told to another living soul. [Thunder and lightning crash ] ﻿Catchy beginning. This island has a secret. A deep, dark secret it has held for 100 years. 100 years ago tonight, a ruthless band of pirates held up in this very house. [ Suspenseful music climbs ] They had looted many ships, and were pursued by government troops. They were heavily laden with their ill-gotten gains, they had to bury the treasure before making their escape. However, [ Thunder and lightning crash ] before they left this island on that stormy night, they signed a contract written in blood. They vowed to return for the treasure 100 years from Halloween night, at the stroke of midnight, even if it meant returning from the grave. [ Thunder and lightning crash ] [ Ticking ] [Thunder and lightning crash ] ﻿Do you believe this? Belie-ie-ie-ve it my friends! The pirates had a 10-year-old cabin boy. I was that boy. I was there. I never took the treasure because they would have found me. There's no escaping them. They know we're here. They know who we are ﻿Well, that made my mind up. ﻿Come on, Odie. Let's blow this joint. ﻿You wanna come, too? [ Ominous chord strikes ] [ Thunder and lightning crash ] - ﻿Uh, where'd he go? -[Panting] ﻿Oh well. Never mind. Let's get to the boat. [ Whimsical tune plays ] [gasp!] Rats! - ﻿There goes my boat. -[Whimper] ﻿Rats! - ﻿There goes my candy! -[Whimpering] ﻿My boat's gone. ﻿My candy's gone. ﻿Dead pirates are cornin' any minute. ﻿It's past my bedtime. ﻿I wanna go home. [ Whines ] [ Clock striking profoundly ] [ Pounding on door ] [ Squeaking ] ﻿It's midnight. Hah ﻿Just as I suspected. ﻿That old man was just - ﻿some kind of lunatic. - [Panting] [ Suspenseful music climbs ] [ Thunder and lightning crash [ Whimsical-suspenseful tune plays ] [ Crickets chirping ] [ Ominous music plays ] [ Gurgling ] ﻿Aaaaaaaaaaaaah [Barking] - Aah! Watch it! - [Barking] [gasp!] We gotta hide, Odie. - [Panting] - We haven't much time. ﻿We gotta find a good place to hide. ﻿Don't worry that [baritone] they know where we are. Both: Nyah nyah nyah nyah - Nyah nyah nyah - [Barking] ﻿Not there, dummy.

Arr! - [Barks sharply] ﻿I guess this story do have a happy ending, ﻿after all, matey. -[Barking] ﻿Let's be shovin' off for home now. [ Barking excitedly ] ﻿So the pirate ghosts got the treasure, ﻿and we got the candy, candy, candy, candy. [ Melancholy tune plays ] ﻿Odie, I'm about to do something ﻿that is totally out of character for me, but, ﻿seeing as how you saved my life ﻿about 18 zillion times tonight, ﻿I wanna give you something. ﻿Something of great personal worth. ﻿Something that represents a great personal sacrifice ﻿on my part. [ Profound sigh ] ﻿Here's your half of the candy. [ Barks, slurps, yips ] ﻿Yeah, I love ya. Now, get outta here. [Yipping ] ﻿What a night. ﻿Boy, am I wired. ﻿I think I'll see what's on TV.
