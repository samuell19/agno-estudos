[music playing] [hen crowing] [horse neighing] [chickens clucking] [music playing] It's all right, Selene. One day you'll fly over the water like it's nothing, I promise. You're looking very beautiful this morning, Beatrice Hamilton. How nice of you to say. Morning, Miss Amy. It is, isn't it? I swear, I don't know where you put it all! Did you sleep in today? No. I was just out walking. We get more like a Hamilton every day. Now, Emma. Shut your mouth, Emma. It's OK, Louis. She's just teasing. Did you lose another button? Bring it up to me later. I'll sew it back on for you. Mrs. Hamilton is asking for you. And what'll it be today? Lawn tennis, then a few hours of poetry reading? Don't forget that shirt. Why are you so nasty to the girl all the time? It's so hard to be the companion to a rich girl. I told you to shut your mouth. Eddie's one of us. You ought to think about things before letting that nastiness fly out of your mouth. Morning. There you are, Edith. Please sit down. So, what are you and Amy doing today? I haven't seen her yet this morning. Well please encourage her to get outside, won't you? Yes. BEATRICE: Can't be good to read all the time, can it? No. Did you ask to see me? Oh, my head is in the ground today, isn't it? We're expecting a distant cousin of mine and I am so distracted. Ida Glenshaw is her name. Poor dear. She has lost her parents. She has been living with two ancient great aunts, Jane and Clara. A rather dure pair, if I recall. And so I've agreed to help Ida find a suitable husband. After all, we'll have the most eligible bachelor staying right here with us for the Green's Cup, Mr. James Percy. He's from a very good family. A little gangly, if I recall. And then Frederick Arlington will be staying over with the Johnston's, so two exceptional bachelors. I would like you to join us for tea today. Me join you for tea? I would like you to make Ida feel welcome. I know if you made it your personal mission, then of course she would. Of course, if you think I could be helpful. Edith, you're never anything but. And perhaps you can persuade Ida not to let Mr. Percy's physical appearance keep her from considering him. The terrible truth is, she has no property and she is not getting any younger. And then it will be Amy's turn. Our little girl. And then you'll be gone. I will? Oh, Edith, dear, you're not going to want to stay here forever. But I never thought of leaving Evenswood. Where would I go? Well you mustn't worry. AMY: Whoever would want to marry me? I'm not good at anything. I blurt out embarrassing things at inappropriate moments. The art of flirtation is desperately lost on me. I can't ride or hunt or dance. I'm afraid, my dear friend, you are stuck with me for as long as you'll have me. Oh, Amy, you mustn't judge yourself by other people's standards. Your attributes are unique. But they're there for all of us to see. Do you think we'd get satisfied Mama's requirement for fresh air? EDITH: But we've just started. AMY: Yes, but Shakespeare waits for us. Can't we go back and read some more? You can read Juliet. Then you are desperate. We left Romeo waiting for her beneath her balcony. So you're coming to tea, at last? I'm so afraid I'm going to say something stupid. Ah, that's what tea is for, to say all the stupid things you've been saving up. What is your cousin Ida like? Ida. I barely remember her. Poor thing if she's to come all this way to find a suitable husband. [music playing] Hello, Ida. Welcome to Evenswood. Ida! Ida, darling! It's so lovely to have you here. You remember Amy? You must be so tired. You look lovely, though. Eddie, here's my shirt. I-- I can't do it right now, Louis. A guest has arrived and I'm expected for tea. You're having tea with the Hamiltons? BEATRICE: Please forgive my husband, Ida dear. He's becoming a contrarian in his dotage. HENRY: It is just I have a bee in my Bonnet about women riding sidesaddle. Well don't you think it's rather ironic that in our concern for the propriety of the ladies, we force ladies to risk their necks that they should ride astride like men? But the scandal! The hunt clubs would have us arrested for being a public disgrace. Well wonderful. A night in jail would do us all a world of good. Maybe we could discuss something a little less political. What? Perhaps our anticipated guest, Mr. James Percy. He doesn't ride sidesaddle, does he? I heard his heart has been broken. No gossip, child. The rumor is that James Percy fell in love with a girl, desperately. He was about to ask her to marry him when he found out his brother loved her too. Well he never said a word, not even when his brother asked him to stand for him at their wedding. This was years ago. He's never given his heart again. How tragic. It simply means he hasn't found the right person yet. Or on the other hand, maybe no one would have him. He was rather unattractive. Looks aren't that important. Isn't that right, Edith dear? What do you think of Mr. Percy's situation? I think you are right. A person's face can change over a lifetime, but the heart can stay true forever. It seems that Mr. Percy has a very pure and beautiful heart, one that would be worth winning. Well said, Edith dear! Edith, you're a romantic poet. EDITH: And that's the path down to the staples. In the summertime it's covered with most beautiful wildflowers. And, uh, over there's a path that leads up to the crags. If you'd allow me, I'd love to show it to you one day. How can I thank you? You've been so kind, Julie. Oh. I-- I just-- I want you to feel at home here. We all do. I mean the Hamiltons and I. And I see you've become quite comfortable with them. My aunts tell me you've been here since you were an infant. Mr. Hamilton saved you from an orphanage in Italy. Yes. They've been very kind to me. I love them as if they were my own family. Of course. A child in such dire circumstances could have ended up anywhere, but you landed here with all of this, and access to the best society. That's not-- I don't really socialize. I am just Amy's companion, that's all. Shall we continue? You don't think about marriage? Me? Well you can't be Amy's companion forever now, can you? I bet you have some deep secrets of your own, being the romantic poet that you are. Perhaps when we've become better friends you will share them with me. Excuse me. Hello, Edith. I'm going into the village for Mrs. Hamilton. I was wondering if you needed anything? Are you sure you're not going to escape a certain Ida Glenshaw? Oh, no sir. She's been very kind. She's so elegant. I'm sure Mr. Percy will be quite taken with her. Well, yes, as a matter of fact. You could get me a box of cigars, thank you. Mrs. Hamilton asked me not to buy you anymore, cigars. Yes, well never mind that. How-- how did Selene do this morning? He still won't jump the water. Well you-- you stay with him. Don't worry, you're secret's safe with me. You are incorrigible. Thank you. [music playing] May I? Sure. He likes you. He can be very selective about who he lets near him. [music playing] Thank you. Here's the shoe, sir. Twisted nearly in half, he did. If you don't mind, I'd like to keep it, sir. Sir? Oh. No I don't mind. No one will ever believe it. [music playing] Ah ha! Only two? Two. Edith, what-- what is it? You're-- you're-- you're-- you're positively, uh-- [piano music] Did I scare you? Yes! Louis, you shouldn't be here. Play Chopin. Don't you ever get tired of it? [piano music] You should have your own piano, Eddie. Pianos are expensive, Lewis. I know. AMY: Has it really been five years? I can't believe how much you've changed! You're so different! You've certainly changed, as well. The last time I saw you, you made me sit in that armchair until I finished reading all of "Oliver Twist" aloud. BEATRICE: Well I warn you, she hasn't changed nearly as much as you have. Well we're delighted that you can ride in the Green's Cup. Your invitation is an honor. And I believe I've just the horse to do you justice. HENRY: Well you don't think we invited you here for your company, do you? Oh, Henry! Though I must warn you, the locals don't take kindly to losing to out-of-towners. And we have years of tradition to uphold of absolutely wretched sportsmanship. Our Ida is quite the horse-fancier herself, but she's far too modest to announce that, aren't you, my dear? Perhaps she'll tell you if you join them for a picnic tomorrow. Might you do that, Mr. Percy? On one condition-- that you all call me James. James Percy. My, what a lovely name that is. Do people tell you that absolutely all the time? [music playing] HENRY: Not only-- it was-- it was my brother, John, who blazed the trails. He loved it up on the crags. So you must share his love for the outdoors, then. Well, no, no, not really. Far too many bugs and things. I-- I'm particularly fond of this sofa. Papa's adventures come in the form of endless letters to various publications. He's becoming quite legendary for his opinions. Oh. Not the brilliance of the mind. You just have a sheer abundance. Oh, you. Nasty girl. The clock persuaded to join your picnic. Oh, how did you? I can never get Edith to socialize. Well done, Mrs. Hamilton. That's very fortunate, you know, because Edith is the one who best knows the trails. Can't we persuade you to come with us? Well if anyone could you could, my darling. But no, I'm far too sensible to go walking uphill for no good reason. Oh, James. This is the friend that I've been telling you so much about, Edith Adelon. Well it's you. You've already met? Not only that, I'm already indebted to her. May I return this to you now, Miss Adelon? Oh, thank you. I see you're healing nicely. Thanks to your prompt attention. It's remarkable that someone who doesn't socialize should know so many people so intimately. Dear, the time is getting away from us. Shall we get going then? Louis, cook, we'll need you back as soon as you've set up. - Yes, ma'am - I can help you. No, sir. I'm fine. Besides, you'll be too busy helping the ladies over logs and raging brooks. Raging brooks is an oxymoron. Make sure Amy behaves, will you please? Goodbye. Thank you. Goodbye. Goodbye. Remember when we were young, Henry? I thought we still were. I understand you've been traveling abroad, James. Are the parties really as grand as they say? Do they last for days? I was there on business. I'm afraid the meetings did last for days. I can only report that I'm happy to be home. This-- this is my true love. True love? Does that mean you're giving up on the human race? It's far less complicated, anyway. If it were up to me, I'd live with nothing but my wits out in the wilderness. A feral animal! It's just like Thoreau. Have you read him too? - Yes. As a matter of fact, I just finished reading-- You wouldn't really want to give up your property, your horses, and all the beautiful things there are to own for nothing? But you can't think of it that way. It wouldn't be for nothing. He'd possess all the sky, from here to the horizon-- all the air and all the sounds that we don't even think of listening to. A person could have all the money in the world and couldn't buy any of that. So you're a naturalist at heart, Miss Adelon? That sounds far too grand for what I am. It's just all I know, unlike Ida, who can appreciate both the great outdoors as well as the pleasures of the city. I was at the summit once, and I came across a rare tagridia pavonia. By yourself? Were you terribly frightened? Tagridia pavonia is a flower. It's perfectly harmless. I think I'll take a little walk. Oh, let me come with you. I want to find a tiger flower too. So you do enjoy nature, Miss Glenshaw? Not in the manner of Miss Adelon. Though I do believe what might occur between a man and a woman and to be most natural, Mr. Percy. Oh! Oh, look at that! You've been here before and you never told me? Amy, if I told you everything you'd get bored with me. Ho, ho, never! Edith, I want to know everything you know. I want to know everything the whole world knows. Do you know that Mr. Percy doesn't mind discussing philosophy with me? Oh? I thought that men were genetically required to ramble on within the confines of athletics and the bloodlines of their animals. But he knows everything! So you've changed your opinion of him. Oh, he makes me see things in a whole new light. You'll see. Amy, be careful. Is Is that a tiger flower, Edith? [screaming] Edith! Amy! Here. Here, hold on. Hold on. I can't! You must. Oh, hold on! Amy! I'll try and pull you up. Please, Amy. - It hurts. - I know. Amy. Amy. Take hold of my arm. Take hold of my arm. Hold on tight. Help me! Here we go. Hold on. Hold on tight. I've got you. I've got you. Just take small steps. Is your arm hurt, Miss Adelon? My scarf! Miss Adelon, don't. Don't. It was my mother's. I'm afraid it's gone. We should get back. All right. Very slowly. You were supposed to look after her. Poor Amy. A dislocated shoulder is extremely painful. But it heals quickly once it slips back in. Oh, good. You girls are very lucky. You had no business climbing the crags. Thank you very much for coming so promptly, doctor. We appreciate it. It wasn't our Amy's fault. Oh it wasn't anybody's fault, Ida. Edith had been up there before. She knew how steep it was. No! She saved my life! She risked her own to do it. It was terrifying. I was slipping away, but Edith wouldn't let go. If you'd been there then you would have seen that. Now, now, now. Ida's just being protective, aren't you dear? The important thing is that you are both safe. Mm hm. I'm so sorry. Don't be, child. You saved our precious daughter. Henry, what can we do to thank her? Well I don't know-- yes I do. She can come to the ball. What? Mm hm. We'll-- we'll celebrate her heroism. What do you say? The Green's Cup ball? Yes! - Oh, no. - Why? No I-- I-- it would it would be a break with tradition. Oh, the devil take tradition! You'll be with us. Come on, what do you say? Do it. Say you will. James will be so pleased. I would interpret that as a yes, wouldn't you Beadie? - Yes I would, dear! - Excellent! Then that's settled. Come on. We'll leave her to have a little sleep. Come on girls. Come on. Come on. [ominous music playing] Lewis. Have you seen Miss Adelon? She's by the pond. Thank you. [music playing] I believe this is yours, Miss Adelon. You went back to get this for me? Thank you! You're welcome. [music playing] Whoa. [horse neighing] Quite the rider, Miss Adelon. May I? Oh! Well, I'm afraid riding is all I'm good at. I find that hard to believe. I should think there'd be a great many things you'd be good at, Miss Adelon. Everything else is such a struggle of etiquette and propriety. Out here it's instinct, not manners. I ride every morning for just a taste of that. And you can leave all matters of manners and propriety to others? I can be sure you're the only woman out riding hours before the ball. I'm afraid it was not the best idea for me to accept. Oh, but you must go. And you must promise to save a dance for me. Oh, no. Oh, no. But why? Have I said something to offend you? No. I can't dance. More modesty. Not a step? Not a step. Come and let me show you something. Dancing is just like riding. It's all instinct and little counting. You step forward on your right foot as I step back on my left, and we take six steps to make one revolution. And-- I can't. Close your eyes. Just hear a waltz. Two, three. Four, five, six. One, two, three. Six. [music playing] See? You're dancing. And I'm falling. Are you coming? Not just yet. Until this evening, Miss Adelon. Ball, is it? You mixing with the Hamiltons now, huh Eddie? Excuse me. Miss Adelon. Wouldn't you go if they asked? They wouldn't ask. BEATRICE: Henry, have you seen my-- can't seem to find my amethyst necklace. You know the one. The one Edith-- Argh! Are you ill? No, I'm not ill. I'm defeated. These trousers have shrunk. Shrunk? Yes. - Well. - No, don't. No. - That's what they do-- They've shrunk. No, they've shrunk. [interposing voices] I mean it's just-- no it's part. Just-- Um, are we doing the right thing, Henry? What do you mean? Do you think-- you know, we will be raising some eyebrows bringing Edith tonight. Oh no. Nonsense, Beadie. No, no. These are civilized people. Besides, they won't even notice Edith when I enter in the altogether. Oh this isn't safe. Funny woman. Come on. No, wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. Nice amethyst. You say there's more where this comes from? It's too bad your poor, sickly mother can't use the stuff anymore. Well she's old, like I said. She doesn't go out much. She'd rather have the money than the memories, huh? Something like that. With enough items of this quality, your old, sick mum could have a whole new life for herself. That's right. A new life. That's what she wants. EDITH: It's beautiful. I want you to be happy tonight, Edith, just like you've made everyone else-- even Ida, although she doesn't always show it. I don't think Ida likes me very much. Oh you mustn't say that. No, Ida's just a little high strung. You know, rather like a mother was before she got married. Oh, she'll come around. Especially now. Well I understand Mr. Frederick Arlington is quite anxious to meet her tonight. So if Mr. Percy isn't careful, he's going to have some competition for her attention. What's that face? I promise you, Ida adore you. And she's going to need your help more than ever, now. Do be patient with her. HENRY: Oh, Ida, how delightful you look. AMY: Pretty. Thank you. Oh, that's lovely. You look lovely, Miss Glenshaw. HENRY: Ah, Mrs. Hamilton! Oh. AMY: That is beautiful. [music playing] Edith! Edith, you look wonderful. Thank you. HENRY: Shall we go? Let us, then. [music playing] - Henry! - Arliss! How are you? - Beatrice! Arliss! Oh, you've outdone yourself again this year. Oh, so good of you to come! Oh, wild horse, etc, etc. You know. You're not nervous are you? No! Well maybe a little. It's a lot of pomp and circumstance, but actually rather few rules. Try to avoid food caught in here when you're shaking hands-- that sort of thing. Miss Glenshaw. You are Miss Glenshaw, aren't you? I'm Fredricka Arlington. I've heard so much about you. You do speak, don't you? Fredrick Arlington. What a lovely name. But you must hear that absolutely all the time. Welcome to my uncle's home. May I? Ida. I was going to introduce her to your nephew, but I see he's already quite beaten me to it. Yes. Uh, Henry? Yes, Arliss? Isn't that your girl? Which one? I--I--I suffer an embarrassment of riches tonight in that direction. Come on, let's go and gorge ourselves at our girls' expense. We'll see you later. [music playing] Oh, there's Edith! Come on. Dance with us. AMY: Yes! Come on, Edith. Just give me your hand. Ready? You two dance. They're rather lovely in the moonlight, aren't they? The gardens. Perhaps we should investigate them more closely, even though it is rather secluded. Should we join the others? What What would you think if I said no? I'm sure a woman of your breeding wouldn't want people to get the wrong impression. They might even think she was too eager. May I? So, Miss Adelon. I've barely had the chance to get to know you. Would you be so kind as to dance with me, Edith? I believe the next dance's supposed to be mine. Perhaps the one after that, my friend. See, it's just like riding. Not at all. Henry. Hello, Arliss. I'm ready for my apology. Your apology for what? For insulting me and my family in my own home. Oh, Arliss. You put on a lovely party. Perhaps you've been enjoying it a little too much. If it were up to me, Henry, I'd have you rejected from the club entirely. Now there's an interesting idea, since it was the Hamiltons that founded the silly thing in the first place. There, you see? You are behaving just like your brother. My brother? Improper. Inelegant, common, and mocking. Tradition is not silly, Henry. At least he had the decency to leave the country if he didn't respect-- John has been dead for over 20 years. Please don't speak ill of him. I need a word with her. You'll forgive me, won't you? What? Look at what you've done. What happened? Now you must listen to me. I can see what are doing, and it will come to no good. What did I do? Of course they're attracted to you. You're young and pretty and why wouldn't you try to entice them? Entice? I'm not blind, Edith. And I'm not being cruel to you. I'm merely saving you from a terrible mistake. Men like James and Fredrick-- they come from a world that you know nothing of. Not really. You see the dances and the refined manners, but not the reality. That you could never understand. What mistake? I don't understand. I want to help you. If you were to marry a man like James, you'd only fail him. In the end, you would embarrass him and this kind family that has taken you in. I would never harm any of them, Ida. You've ruined the ball with your mockery. Please don't raise your voice. And I have not ruined your, until now, perfectly pleasant party. The drama! Why else bring your help where she doesn't belong? You know, Arliss Edith is one of the most decent people I have ever known. And while you're rummaging in your bag of traditions, for God's sake try to find a little compassion. Do you believe me now? You're not one of us, Edith. And if you care about this family-- if you care about James Percy-- you'll stay away. Stay away from a world you'll never be a part of. Not really. There you are. You're not leaving, are you? It's late. No it isn't. Not terribly anyway. Well at least let me walk you out. I just want a few minutes without people. I don't know where to begin. Since we met, something's happened to me. I've lost all sense of what my life was. I have no coherent thoughts. Well, that's not true. I have one coherent thought. The same one over and over about you. No. Please don't do this. Please just listen. When I was young I fell desperately in love. When it ended, I was broken. I remained that way. And so I thought a man just gets one chance, just once in a lifetime. But it isn't true. Edith, you've proven to me that I can feel again. - You mustn't say these things-- - I must! - To me! - The words are choking me. If I don't tell you-- You can't! Not to me! Not to me. [music playing] IDA: Precious, isn't it? I believe our dear Amy is infatuated. Obviously James finds her too young to be suitable, but still I think you can see the point I was trying to make the other night. I wasn't trying to be cruel, you know. Thank you, Ida. We're friends after all. In fact, I have a peace offering to make. I persuaded Aunt Jane to allow you to go and live with them. They'll need someone to feed them and help them with the house. It isn't as grand as this, naturally, but at least it would solve a lot of your problem. And who knows-- a your situation-- you might even find a match for yourself. Someone who is more suitable. There you are! The elusive Edith. Are you joining us at last? Thank you, Frederick. Perhaps another time. Think about it, Edith dear. Transitions are always hard. But really, isn't it only fair to let Amy find her own companion now? [ominous music playing] [horse neighing] HENRY: Good morning, Arliss. Henry. You're not riding. That means the terms of the trials don't apply to your horses? One of the privileges of being president of the cup. Ah. Besides, my horses' bloodlines are older than your family's and mine. Indeed. No one questions their ability to qualify for the race. Perhaps the same principle could apply tomorrow. You wouldn't have to race. We just give you the cup anyway. I'll race, Henry. And you will convey our condolences to your Mr. Percy, won't you? For what reason? You haven't heard? No, what? - His stallion stepped in a hole and bowed a tendon. Oh. Oh, I'm-- I'm sorry to hear that. Yes, we hope he's not too terribly down in the mouth about it. - Oh no. I'm sure he'll be able to put it into perspective. After all, it's-- it's only a horse race! Henry, you remember how much my father revered the Green's Cup? - Indeed, I do. Yes. He was of the opinion that competition proved the metal of good breeding. Horse and man. Well he particularly loved and relished testing his theory against your father and your brother-- looked forward to it all year. So it's a pity you failed to produce a rider, Henry. Robbed me of something to look forward to with the same vigor. Edith! Edith, where are you? Edith! Could you come here please? Oh. What happened? Come here. Come with me. Sit down. Edith, I want you to help me. You know, Edith, I have lived my whole life here in the company of pompous morons like Arliss Johnson. And my whole life it has irritated me, and I refuse to believe it. But now I believe it. By God, do I believe it. And, you know, the worst, the most unforgivable thing that these people have done to me? What? They robbed me of my brother. Oh yeah. That's-- that's why he left, you know, because he couldn't stand the idiocy, the hypocrisy of this society-- all the Arliss Johnsons of this world. And you know, he thought I was one of them. And I was, but not now. Not anymore. For years I've-- I've--I've mouthed seditious ideas. But I have done nothing. Now there's something I want to do. And you-- you might-- you might think this is a little silly. I'd like us to win the Green's Cup, and I know Selene can do it. - Yes, he can! - Yes? Good. But I-- I think you might have a little trouble with him. He's a bit of a handful. No no no. I'm not going to ride the stupid animal. No, you have to ride him. I can't jump sidesaddle. Of course. No. Astride, you have to ride him astride. In fact, you could use my brother's saddle. It's probably still in his trunk. Women aren't allowed. Well that's the whole point. Why the hell aren't women allowed? Did you ever hear anything so stupid? Why'd you raise your eyebrows when I said hell? Last Sunday preacher said it 17 times. I counted. So? They won't let me. There are no written rules. Let me take care of them. Hm? Edith. Oh, Edith, please do it. Hm? We'll win. [music playing] Lewis? What are you doing? Nothing. What are you hiding? Show it to me. Please, Eddie. Let me see. You're stealing from the Hamiltons. What's happened to you? - Nothing! You're stealing! Stealing? Did the Hamiltons break their back day in and day out to earn Evenswood? They have of this because they were born to it. They don't even know we exist. That's not true. They're very good to us. Open your eyes. You think you're one of them but you're not their blood. You're not family. They don't care about you, Eddie-- not like I do. This should be yours. Stop it. I am not a thief, and neither are you. What are we going to do? Don't turn me in. Oh, Lewis, you know I would never. Promise me. I'll give you my word if you promise me you will never do this again, ever. Do you understand? Go on, then. You mustn't be in here. What were you doing in there? I was just returning the necklace Mrs. Hamilton let me wear to the ball. By the way, I received a letter from my aunt. You haven't forgotten them, have you? I fear rejection from you now would be almost cruel to the poor old things. Yes, I understand. BEATRICE: Are you sure, Edith? Are you absolutely positive? Yes. I can't imagine the house without you. I've--I've--I've just never pictured it. But you said yourself that one day I might move on. I have my own life. Yes, but not so soon! I mean, right after the Green's Cup? I--I never meant that. It's so generous of our Edith to help my unfortunate auntie. Yes. I just so hate change. I--I fear whatever it brings can't possibly make me happier than I am right now. But that's selfish. You are young. Change means something else to you. So, of course you want to go. Oh, Edith dear, what will we do without you? [music playing] Now, remember that Selene hasn't had a chance to see the course like the other horses. Now, the water jump in the toughest. Sir, I-- I think this is a mistake. Nonsense, you'll be fine. As long as you remember it's just like dancing. You can do it. Edith, I'm so excited for you. Good luck. Henry, are you sure about this? Don't you trust me, Mrs. Hamilton? Yes, but what if Edith makes a spectacle of herself? ARLISS: What is this idiocy? Hello, Arliss. Henry, you've gone too far this time. Are you mad? You should save your energy, Arliss. This girl can ride rings around you. This is not permitted. She's not even family. I read the rule book. It says nothing about-- There is no rule book, Henry. It is tradition. And this is not croquet. It's dangerous. She's riding astride, which is a disgrace. And I will not allow it. I will absolutely not allow it. You were afraid of Edith making a spectacle. Really, Arliss. No No. Absolutely not. Arliss! If anyone were listening, and I do believe that everyone is, it might seem as though you were afraid of losing to a woman. Yes. Oh, let her ride. What harm could it do? In fact, if she can't, I won't. Anyone else like to weigh in on this? Stay out of my way. Do you hear me? Her blood will be on your hands, Henry. This is not her place, and I'll make no sacrifices. Edith, keep your concentration. We are already proud of you. Good luck. Go to it. Ladies first. [music playing] Riders to your marks, get set [gunshot] [music playing] Is Edith all right? Thoughtful girl, she's easy to follow. She's dead last. [music playing] Come! Come on! A rider's gone down at the end of the grove. - Not our Edith! - No no no. She's closing in on them. They're coming to the double jump. IDA: The double jump? From Seems terribly inappropriate for a lady. How is our Edith doing now? She's-- oh, another rider's gone down. She's in sixth place. She crosses the meadow. Go Edith! - They're coming to the bridge! - And Edith? She's still in sixth place. Now comes the biggest test of all. The water jump. Selene's never jumped the water before. What did you say, father? I-- I What? I said, no, she's having a wonderful time. [dramatic music playing] She's done it! She's cleared the water! Selene's cleared the water! Where's Fredrick Arlington? Where are they now? Here they come! They're headed for home! She's closing in! [dramatic music playing] [cheering] Wonderful! Edith, you showed them! You showed them! Wonderful! You were wonderful. JAMES: Edith, I wanted to congratulate you after the race, but you were surrounded by everyone. And after the other night, I-- I feel I said some things I shouldn't have said. No. Please. I don't want you to take back what you said to me. I play your words over and over again inside my head. Why did you run away? You must understand that it isn't you. Everything you do, your words, your kindness-- But what is it? Something has made you unhappy. It's not my happiness I question. You and I are very different, James. Edith, that doesn't matter to me. It matters to me. I've accepted a new position, and I'll be leaving Evenswood. Are you coming to dinner? Or are you hibernating? This is-- this is a poem I-- I wrote to John when I was 10. He-- he took it to Italy with him. Look at all this stuff, Beadie. I was-- I was so angry with John for dying. I never looked through this before. Why am I such a stubborn old fool? So we can all tell you we love you, despite your being a stubborn old fool. Don't be long, dear. No. Oh, dear God. Oh. Oh! I thought you were going to join me for a sherry. I've changed my mind. That happens. [dramatic music playing] Miss Glenshaw. I think there's something you'll want to see. Pardon? It's Edith. She's asked for you. She took the path toward the garden. [dramatic music playing] The illusive Edith. Did you follow me here? Like your obedient dog. I've been listening to all your quiet little signals for me. My God, they're so subtle I almost had to read your mind, which is what you wanted, isn't it? Someone who knows you better than you know yourself. So, now I'm here with you, as you commanded. Alone. I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Arlington. I'm afraid you've misread whatever signals you think you might have heard. Did I? It was their subtlety that intrigued me. You could see I have no use for avert women. They bore me. I should be going. I-- [dramatic music playing] Please. I can offer you so much, if you'll let me. I can give you the sort of life you've never even imagined. Let me. - Please! Edith! Ah! Have you no respect? Can't you mind your own business? Go! Now! Are you hurt? No. You are trembling. Hold my arm. I was just surprised. You cut yourself. It's nothing. At least allow me to return the kindness you once showed me. Where is the boy? Are you deaf? I told you I need my horse! Now! Yes, sir. I'm doing my best, sir. Well that's not good enough! What is it? I'm not sure, sir. It's Mr. Arlington. - He'll be on his way. - Stay out of this! It's none of your business! - What has happened? Nothing. Mr. Arlington is no gentleman, sir. And Edith's been made to suffer his undignified behavior. What are you looking at? Go! - What have you done to her? - Nothing. What have you done to her? What difference does it make? She's just a servant. Call her what you will, she'll never be our kind. What did you do to Edith! What did you do to her! Nothing! Sir? Henry! Oh, Henry! [dramatic music playing] I was just remembering a gust of wind. That first moment. It was summer. You were so-- you were so young. If I'd been your father, I'd have shot me. You were wearing white and your hair was-- was tied back so politely. And then a little-- a little gust of wind suddenly did what I'd wanted to do since I first saw you. It just took-- it took a little strand of your hair and just caressed your face with it. And I knew then. That I'd love you forever. Oh! That's-- that's what I'll remember, Beadie. Beadie, I-- I have to ask you a favor. What? Something-- something has happened. I-- I have to talk to Edith alone. Edith? Please don't ask me to explain. You ask-- ask Edith to come in. Yes. Edith, please come. You rode magnificently today. It's in your-- in your blood, isn't that? Maybe it is. I don't know. Oh. I should have known. Know what? In my In my jacket there's a leather pouch. Get it. Get it. You know, when-- when I went to Italy to bury my brother, he left no-- no letter. You know, we hadn't-- we hadn't spoken in years. And there was no-- no evidence of-- of-- of his childhood. There was nothing to remind him of-- of Evenswood. All I found was this-- this abandoned infant who was the daughter of his maid. I was so taken by her sweetness. And everyday since then, I've been blessed by that same sweetness. To think I almost left you there. Oh. It's all right. That was long ago. You know, I-- I was so angry with my brother, that I-- I didn't-- I didn't go through his things. I robbed you, darling Edith. I robbed you. What do you mean? Open it. Open. Who is she? She's your mother. This is my mother? Yes. Yes. It's your mother. She died, though, in that same epidemic. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. You've done nothing wrong. You saved me. You raised me as your very own. I was just a stranger to your family. No no no. My brother John was your father. What? Yes. How could that be? They were married. They were married. It's all there. And there's more. Edith, I thank you from my soul. I beg you to be good to them because I-- I won't be here, you know, to help them. Oh, stop. You know I will always take care of them. I know. I know. Please forgive me, Edith. Please forgive me. Forgive you? For what? You were the only father I have ever loved. I love you too, Edith. I always have. [music playing] And today we lay to rest the mortal remains of Henry Otis Hamilton. His spirit, however, remains alive in all of us here today-- his loved ones, his loyal wife, Beatrice, Amy, and Edith, whom he loved for his own. From this day forward, for the rest of our own days on this earth, we will nourish his spirit, and keep it alive with our memories. AMY: What do we do now? I didn't know I'd feel scared. Promise you won't leave us, Edith. Promise you'll stay. EDITH: Yes, of course I'll stay. BEATRICE: Oh no, I couldn't bear any more change now. You know how I feel about change, Edith. It doesn't bode well when one is already perfectly happy. Right now I want to just hold on. Keep things exactly as they are. [music playing] JAMES: I can't imagine how I could have been blind to it all these weeks. Tonight I only beg your forgiveness, if this has hurt you, but at last my senses have returned to me. I see before me the woman I've always hoped for, and it is you. Yours in devotion, Henry. I had no idea papa was so romantic. He wrote that when he was very young. Would you indulge me with another? Of course. My dearest Beatrice. [piano music playing] I wish we were blood relations, so I could tell you anything I wanted and couldn't get mad and leave. Pretend we are blood relations. Then I have a secret to tell you. And I'll burst if I don't tell someone, though I suspect it won't make you entirely happy. Promise if it doesn't please you that you won't let it show. I'll try. Well I've known for a while and have wanted to announce it, but I don't know how. You don't have to. I know. Did James tell you? He didn't have to. It's clear, Amy. You're perfect for him, and of course I'll be happy if you and James marry. Marry James? Why would I want to marry James? I don't want to get married. Oh, Edith, you should see your face. Well then what? I'm going to go to college. It's all James and I talk about. He knows so much about the world! I can learn it too, he says. Why would that make me unhappy? Because I'm going to be leaving you. I remember once I promised you I never would, and now I'm going back on it. That part is going to make me very unhappy. And with papa gone too, the house will seem-- Edith, say something. I'm so proud of you. Will you help me tell mama? I don't want to upset her anymore. Can you convince her that it's not a terrible thing to be bookish? We'll tell her you're going to change the world just like your father would have wanted. I think she'll be very proud of that. But you have to promise to write every day. Would it be awfully irritating if I wrote twice a day? So, you're really going back to the city? Yes. Sometime tomorrow. I thought you might just head off to your beloved wilderness with nothing but the clothes on your back. Unfortunately we don't always get what we want in life. Well, I've made it my personal goal not to accept that philosophy. It's too bad we didn't get to know each other, really. We'll have to find another chance. Actually I think we know more than enough about each other. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to sound harsh. I think you did. Forgive me, then. I think you can't help yourself. I think your disappointments have turned your heart cold, and it is your cold, dead heart that says these things. My heart is neither dead nor cold-- it's just none of your business. But it's somebody else's, isn't it? Surely you haven't fallen for Amy's infatuation? She's just a child. You're embarrassing yourself. Edith. Of course. It's in your face. Edith, the pathetic orphan. What are you doing here? Mrs. Hamilton lost some jewelry, and-- And you think it's here? How dare you! We were told to look everywhere, that's all. I didn't mean to-- - Get out. Wait. Where have you looked so far? We just started, ma'am. Tomorrow we're to look top to bottom. [dramatic music playing] You found it? - Not yet, ma'am. - Look everywhere. Be thorough. We all are, ma'am. AMY: At least she decided to enjoy her character for virtue. It's happened again! Mother, what is it? That necklace that your father gave me as a wedding gift is gone. It happened last night. We're being robbed by someone who lives amongst us. Edith, dear, are you all right? You look a bit shaken. Excuse me. That was rather odd, wasn't it? Have you seen Lewis? Not today. [dramatic music playing] Where did you find them? In your bedroom, Edith. My bedroom? I'm sure there's a logical explanation for this. Of course, if you could just tell us what it is. I don't know. I don't know how they got there. You don't think I could've taken them, do you? Perhaps she forgot to return them the night of the ball. They did look beautiful around your neck. No I-- I-- I replaced them the next day. Remember Ida, you were there. You saw me coming out of the bedroom. Edith, dear, I don't know what you're talking about. I wish I did. Edith, say something. Why did you walk out so suddenly this morning? I thought I might have known who-- Of course you did. Who? I can't say. Well surely your loyalty cannot lie elsewhere after all this family has done for you. Please forgive me. I-- I gave my word. But why would this other suspect put the necklace in your room? BEATRICE: You have to tell me how this happened. I can't have a thief living in my own house. Edith. This is tormenting her, can't you see? There must be some explanation. Stop! Stop the wagon! Edith, let me help you. You don't have to explain anything to me. I couldn't begin to. I know you couldn't betray them. Edith, let me take you away from here. I could make you safe, and-- and if you let me, I might even make you happy again. You're being a true friend. Your kindness is far more than I deserve. Edith, this isn't the kindness of a friend you hear. I'm trying to tell you that I'm in love with you. Oh, James, I have nothing to give you. Nothing but your heart, which is more than I could ever hope for. Edith, come away with me. Had you said these words an hour ago, I could have told you that I have loved you from the moment that I saw you. But you can't take me away from the shame that goes with me now. Don't you see? It will follow me no matter where I go. Edith. I have nothing to give you. Perhaps she needed the money. Desperation pushes a person to do a foolish thing. Shut up, Ida! Children. - These are private quarters. - Here. Take it. It's poison to me. Why? You'll find one missing. I already sold it. See, I told you. So, you and Edith a were partners, stealing from poor Mrs. Hamilton. No. Eddie wouldn't steal! She tried to set me straight! You were there! You almost saw me yourself. I don't know what you're talking about. Yeah, you do. You were talking to Eddie right outside the Mrs.' room. She was returning something. Surely you can't believe him. A pathetic, common thief. Ida, you've dug your hole deep enough. I think you should consider a new home. You're no longer welcome in ours. You should have this too. It's burnt. Eddie tried to burn it. As I was running away, that reminded me that-- that Eddie's goodness would haunt me no matter where I went. Mother, what is it? Oh! Emma, please bring Edith. Edith, dear, uh, please sit down. How did you find that? We waited for you. Please leave us. I, John Otis Hamilton, do give and bequeath my entire estate to my only child, my daughter Edith Adelon Hamilton, who shall inherit Evenswood upon the 25th year of her birth. - Stop. Please. I never wanted you to see that. You tried to burn it? Why? This means that you and I-- mother, Edith is our own cousin! BEATRICE: Yes. You knew this? Don't you see? I already had everything I wanted. I had your love and your confidence. And I had my home with you, which is more than I could have ever dreamed of. And I thought that would change things. And you-- you said yourself that you didn't want anything to change, and neither did I. But now what difference does it make, because I've lost your confidence. No. Mother, tell her. No piece of paper-- My dear, my dear-- Make that go away. There's There's been a terrible misunderstanding. Ida deceived us. And I accused you unjustly, and I beg your forgiveness from the bottom of my heart. Take this. It's your inheritance. Only if you promise that it will change nothing. Only if you want it to. Welcome home, Edith! Edith! We really are blood sisters now! [music playing]
