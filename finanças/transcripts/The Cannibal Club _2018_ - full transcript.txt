THE CANNIBAL CLUB Am I interrupting? Of course not, boss. I was just resting. Do you need anything, sir? No. I just came to tell you that I'm going to Fortaleza. Work stuff. It's ok, take it easy. Rest. Shouldn't I put the stuff in the car? No. You do it on Monday when I come back to pick up Gilda. Is madam staying? Yes. She's staying. Gilda is allergic to work. Another thing... Come closer. I know it isn't your job, but Lucivaldo is coming with me, so I need you to watch the house. Do you know how to use it? I think so. As long as you don't kill my wife, it's alright. Was it good for you, my love? Are you asking me or him? There is only one "love". Yes. It was great. It's so good, dear. You're just saying that to please me. I even think we should open a restaurant. Only if you learn how to cook. No way. Then you would settle. On the contrary, it would be a spur. And it would keep you busy. It would what? Keep you busy. I don't need anything to keep me busy, dear. Or do you think I've nothing to do? - I didn't mean that. - And what did you mean? Do we need to argue about this? I expressed badly. I'm sorry. Ok, it's over. Look. I told him to be here at 23:30. One hour late. 43 minutes. Are you defending him? No dear. Not at all. I just think you could be less intolerant. He knows I can't stand tardiness. Hi, Mr. Otavio. Excuse me. I just wanted to let you know that I'm here. I heard. I was late looking for a place to eat. But everything was closed. What a pity. Would you like to have dinner with us, Lucivaldo? No, no way, Mrs. Gilda. Don't be silly. Grab a chair and sit. I don't want to bother. I better go. No, you better stay, Lucivaldo. I'm telling you to sit down. Are you deaf, Lucivaldo? Sit. She's kidding. Lucivaldo. Gilda is kidding. Go take your place. Ok. Excuse me. Good night, Lucivaldo. What? I was just kidding. Lucivaldo? Lucivaldo? I'm sorry, Mr. Otavio. My God, I didn't know it was you, sir, I was surprised... - Forgive me. - Ok. Ok. Ok! Here. You don't deserve it, but take it. Thank you, Mr. Otavio. Thank you. Thank you. You shouldn't have worried. - It looks great. - Really? Thank you, boss. From my heart. Three things, Lucivaldo. Pay attention. First: Today I fired Josimar. If he shows up here, shoot him. Second: if you arrive late again you will end up like him. I can't stand tardiness and that's it. Third... I don't allow my employees to entertain themselves in work hours. If I catch you again with this headphones I swear on my mother's grave... I will shove this shotgun entirely up your ass. Without spit. Did you hear me? Mr. Otavio, let me explain, this was the first time... Did you hear me? Yes or no? Yes, sir. Good. The good people of Fortaleza are scared. This is a fact. Our researh shows that 92% of those good citizens don't believe the state will solve the crime and violence. And 67% of them don't trust the police anymore. Hoc est, publicum target. This is our target audience. Citizens who are tired of not being able to come and go, to freely enjoy their goods, their acquisitions. Citizens who are feeling unsafe. Helpless. Under the constant threat of losing their lives or someone they love. Facing such a complex and delicate situation, who can ensure the peace and quietness that we deserve by right? - Our security guards? - Your security guards. Only a private security guard can assume this role. And it's in your company, OnTarget private security, where the good citizens will find the most well trained heroes in the market. 15:30 PM IN MY OFFICE. SUBJECT OF GREAT MATTER. Ask them to play the ad again. Mr. Otavio would like to see the ad again, please. And another thing... If you can't get the tractors out of there we destroy everything and build it again. No problem. What matters is to have the opening ceremony. If there are two openings, even better. Understood? Great. Great, Afranio. I knew that deep down you were a clever guy. Bye. Otavio, my dear. My congressman. Sit. Would you like something to drink? Scotch? No, no. Thank you. Fatima, send me two glasses of that 18 year old scotch. - Any news? - Everything's the same. - Gilda is doing well? - Yes, she's fine. Wonderful. - And how is Eleonora? - She is fine. Eleonora is a Saint. Never gives me a hard time. Are you and Gilda coming to Eleonora's birthday? Of course. Come in. Well, let's get to business. I called you here to discuss a delicate matter. About our Club. Speaking of which, what about our rendezvous? Next Wednesday? I didn't get any message. Yes, our rendezvous is on Wednesday at the same time. Only this time you'll receive the address half an hour before. May I know why the mystery? Otavio, my friend. I suspect that one of our mates is talking too much. Walking with the wrong ones. Speaking with those he shouldn't. I believe the bastard is conspiring with our enemies. Do you have a name? - Clovis. - Clovis? Yes, Clovis. I would never guess. - Are you sure? - My intuition never fails me. I'm in charge of Clovis's security. I know that. I want you to put one of my men to replace yours. At the party tomorrow? No. On the night of our rendezvous. Make up some excuse. He will never suspect you. Can I count on you? Of course you can. Perfect. Bravo! Well done! That's a good one. Was your trip nice? Nice? It was sensational. That's a real country. Civilized people, well mannered, clean. Totally different than here. First World countries are something else. I love First World countries. Much better than Third. Tell me about it. It's so depressing to come back. - Right, dear? - It's because everything works. It's not a mess like Brazil. Just to be able to go out unworried, to park your car anywhere, without fear or concern. - Without squeegee punks. - That's right. Without squeegee punks. I hate them. For me, they should all die. I don't know about you, but I need to fuck every day. At least once. Me too. Every day. Especially when my wife is out of town. Imagine if you still had your prostate, right Clovis? Madam? Madam, are you alright? Do you need anything? - Would you like me to call someone? - No, is not necessary dear. Thank you. - Are you sure? - Yes. You can go. - Good evening. - Good evening, ma'am. Where's Lucivaldo? - He left. - Long time ago. Where did he go? - He went that way. - Down there. - That way? - Right. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Good night. - What's the matter? - Nothing. - Nothing? - Yes, nothing. - Then why this buttface? - I have a headache. - You're lying. - Otavio, don't annoy me. And look forward. Gilda, we need to talk. No, my love. We don't need to talk. Yes we do, Gilda. Yes we do. You have to respect my authority. I'm your husband. Understand? You need to fix this mischievous behavior of yours. I won't stand for this kind of behavior anymore. I won't stand it. Gilda, my dear. Hi, Borges. To what do I owe this unexpected visit? I wanted to talk to you about last night. About last night? Yes. About last night. - Would you like something to drink? - No. - Water? Coffee? - No, it's ok. - Are you sure? - Yes. Ok. You can talk. I just wanted to let you know that I don't have any prejudice. I don't judge. From the bottom of my heart. I really think that we need to... Look for what fulfills us. What gives us... ... true pleasure. No matter what people will think or say. What matters is to be happy. I also wanted to tell you... You don't need to worry. I'll never tell anyone what I saw yesterday. I swear. Not even to Otavio. You can trust me. I will take this secret to the grave. Gilda, dear... I have no idea of what you are talking about. What? I should be asking you. I'm talking about the little house in the back. The warehouse. Warehouse? Yes. Yesterday at the party, in the back. The warehouse with all that rubbish, hat situation in the warehouse... Gilda... I want to confess you something. I'm not understanding anything that's happening here. But you are making me very curious. Please, go on, dear. You were saying that you don't have any prejudice. - That what matters is to be happy. - Yes. No matter what people will think. Right? Yes. I said that. Tell me. What exactly are you talking about? Is everything ok? Yes it is. Everything is fine. - Are you sure you don't want a drink? - No. I better not. I drank too much last night. I went over the top. - Actually I don't remember anything. - It happens. I drank too much scotch, I'm still a little confused. Feeling dizzy. I messed up the words. That's all. I came here to apologize for last night. Although I don't remember anything. Don't worry, Gilda. You don't need to apologize for anything. Everyone has the right to go over the top once and a while. It's part of human nature. Don't you agree? Yes, I do. I agree one hundred percent. So don't worry. And keep in mind that you are always welcome. Even completely drunk. Borges, you're the best. Well, I'm... I'm relieved. You've no idea how much. Rufino de Alencar 299, Centro. Do I look good? Are you gonna dinner with Do Carmo? - Why? - I don't feel like it. - Is Marinete here? - She has the day off. And what are you gonna eat, honey? I don't know, Otavio. I'm not hungry. Do you want me to bring you something? For breakfast? Move away, please. I'm leaving. Have fun. How many times are we gonna argue about this? About what? You going out to party while I stay home? You know that if I could I would take you, Gilda. - But I don't make the rules, dear. - Of course not. You only obey. If you're incapable of putting yourself in someone else's shoes... this conversation can't go any further. Put myself in someone else's shoes? - I can't believe you're saying this. - Yes, put yourself in someone's shoes. Be more comprehensive. Otavio. go away. You're making this worse. Don't complain later that I didn't want to talk. That I'm intolerant. - I tried. - Ok. Bye. Good evening, my dear friends. First, I would like to thank Abelardo... for lending us his wonderful restaurant so we can continue our gathering. As all of you may have noticed, our fellow Clovis is not among us tonight. And it seems that his absence will be for good. I just got the news... that our friend had a terrible accident. And unfortunately there is almost no chance to recover. However my friends, in spite of this dreadful incident and the pain that strikes us... We cannot let it ruin our celebration. And we must do it for Clovis. A man of cheerful and optimistic nature. Life goes on and one thing is certain... Our dear friend will be always alive in our minds and in our hearts. To Clovis. To Clovis. I would also like to take this moment in which we're moved and shaken by the loss of a beloved brother... to propose another toast. Let's toast to the loyalty that brings us together. We, distinctive men devoted to the highest values. As long as we stay loyal to each other and to our principles... we'll be eternally worthy of our protagonism in society. Protagonism, my friends... that demands us more attention and responsibility. Because our enemies... Those who want to destroy the values of family, faith and work. Those who want to make our country a land of poors, delinquents, pederasts and a filthy scum that should be smashed under our feet. They're capable of everything to bring us down. But we won't fall down. Never. Because we're many and we're strong. And as long as we stay together, loyal and true to our principles... nothing and no one will ever destroy us and our nation. To Brazil and to the Brazilian people! Jonas Edivandilson Nascimento da Silva, right? Yes, ma'am. I see on your r?sum? that you've worked as waiter, delivery boy, security, attendant, plumber, touristic guide and contractor assistant. Yes, ma'am. Very well. How long have you been unemployed? Two or three months. It hasn't been easy for anyone. - I see... - Times are hard. I understand. Well... Your rsum will be going to our system, ok? And if any opportunity comes up we'll contact you, ok? But there isn't any vacancy? Well, not for this... I mean, not for these jobs. - And what do you have? - Only for caretaker. Caretaker is fine for me. No problem. Do you have any experience as a caretaker? Yes, I do, ma'am. I do. Right... Just one second. - Are you from here, Jonas? - No, I'm from the countryside. - Do you have family here? - No, ma'am. - Any friends? - No. But I'm very sociable. Do you have any health problem? Take any medication? No. Nothing. Have you ever been in a serious accident? I fell off a motorcycle once, but nothing serious. Thank God. - Are you evangelical? - No, but I respect it. - Drug user? - No way. Never. Would be fine for you to live in the workplace? Yes, sure. I even prefer it. Ok, Jonas. So... Is it over? Here, yes. Now you must go to the next room. What is it over there? Clinical examination, pictures. Basic stuff. - What's your name? - Cec?lia. Was everything ok here? Did I get the job? - We'll contact you, Jonas. Good luck. - Thank you. - Where's Lucivaldo? - Good question. That scumbag disappeared. No sign of him. I had to replace him for that idiot in the back. - Has something happened to him? - I hope so. I hope he got ran over by a garbage truck and has been crushed into pieces. I'm sure he won't do anything against us. We had a very nice talk. You've no idea what Borges is capable of. He's capable of killing a poor bastard like Lucivaldo. Really? Then why did you go over there to talk to him? I don't know. Borges likes you a lot, Otavio. He likes me too. Less than you, but still. - And Clovis also. - What? Nothing. Anyway, what matters is that I made him believe that I don't remember anything. But you do? I think so. Lucivaldo and him were... ? Yes. - Through the ass? - Of course, Otavio. - Borges's ass? - It wasn't mine. Borges fucked in the ass. I could never imagine. Isn't that what you do in those rendezvous of yours? Fucking each other? - Gilda, respect me. - What? I'm no man who likes getting fucked. But since your boss does it, you're free to do it. Would you stop? I don't know why you get so upset, Otavio. I'm not, I just don't want to talk about ass. Neither mine, or Borges's, or anybody else's. See how upset you are? I'm not upset. I'm worried about our situation. What situation, Otavio? There's no situation, honey. - Everything is under control. - You think it is, Gilda. But it isn't. And you know why? Just because you saw Borges being fucked. Worse, you saw Borges being fucked by an employee. And he knows that you saw him. And he knows that you remember it. He knows that sooner or later you'd end up speaking. And do you know why he knows that, Gilda? Do you? Don't be paranoid, Otavio. Go get the door. It must be the new caretaker. - Jonas? - That's me. - Did you walk here? - From the bus stop to here. Yes. It's very far. You're crazy. The girl from HR just gave me a map, didn't say anything. I'm gonna talk serious with Cecilia. This is unacceptable. Don't worry about it. Mr. Otavio. I'm used to it. Poor guy is sunburned. Come in. I'll get you some water. Thank you. Excuse me. Pay attention, Ramirez. I want you to double your attention. Not double, triple. Quadruple. Yes, sir. - Do you understand? - I understand, sir. - Sure? - I understand, sir. You know why I'm asking you this, Ramirez? No, I don't, sir. - Know why? - I don't, sir. There's a gang burgling this area. An extremely dangerous gang. If you see any weird movement here, any movement at all, you shoot. - Open fire. - Yes, sir. - You get it? - Yes, sir. Shoot first and ask questions later. Yes, sir. The first one they kill is the security guy. No way this will happen, sir. No way. I trust you. You can trust me, sir. Do you need anything, Mr. Otavio? I'm sorry to wake you at this time, Jonas. But I do need. Do you know how to use it? - Yes, I do. - Great. I know this isn't part of your job. but I... I need you to be aware of any strange movement, any noise around here. There's a gang burgling this area, a very dangerous one. And our big eye friend might not handle it, you know? I understand. Tomorrow I'll get some backup. But tonight I need to count on you. Can I trust you? Yes. If you want I won't even sleep. I do want it, Jonas. Thank you. Don't mention, sir. Anything you need. Mrs. Gilda? Drop the weapon. You need to talk to him, Otavio. And tell him what, Gilda? Tell him what? Borges will never admit or change his mind. - So? - So we are screwed. And it's all your fault. For sticking your nose where you shouldn't. It's not like that. If he were so tough we wouldn't be alive having this conversation. fsBy the way, where were you when those guys got here? It doesn't matter now, Otavio. I have an idea. Listen. First, you call Borges asking for his help. To kill you? Is this a good time for jokes? I honestly don't think so. - I'm sorry. - Can I go on? You tell him that two guys entered the house and killed the security, the caretaker and me. And that you... That you managed to kill one and catch the other alive. And that you're gonna rip off his nails one by one until he confess who sent them here. Borges will never buy it, Gilda. He better will. Or do you have a better plan? Come on, Otavio. I'm listening. Ok. Let's say he believes. In my story or yours? Yours, Gilda. He'll be afraid of his guy saying something and will come here to kill him. And you. Perfect. But we kill the bastard first. This won't work out, Gilda. It's too complex. One must have cold blood for that. We're not murderers. If you want to stay alive, as I do, it has to work. - And after? - After what? After. Or do you think the police won't investigate his death? We blame it on Jonas. We can eat Jonas... and say that he ran away. It's a great idea. No one will ever suspect us. Never. I love you, Otavio. I love you, Gilda. Borges asked you to come up. To carry the body. Did I wake you? - No. I was already up. - Right. - Do you need anything? - Yes, I do. I need you to bury the bodies that we put in the car. I'm kidding. Leave the bodies there. I came to say that I'm leaving. To solve our situation. Tomorrow morning I'll be back with backup. Can you hold the fort? Yes. Great. Take good care of my wife. Ok? Let's switch. Turn over. No, stay there. There. Gilda... Gilda.
