It's the concert event of the decade, right? I mean, it's so much better than Lollapalooza. 'Cause they, okay, they got two stages, right? And there's, like, 30 bands. And they got all these tents with a bunch of cool stuff. Oh, sounds like a traveling Woodstock. Yeah, yeah. So, you know, uh, at Red Rocks, my girlfriend and I were selling beersicles in the parking lot. Yeah? Totally made enough to see both nights. Cool. Yeah. But, man, I got to tell you, Lenny Kravitz was just, he was the best last night. I mean, he only got to play 45 minutes because Bob Dylan made a special appearance with him. That's amazing. I know. Like, why would they bump Lenny, okay? Lenny, for some old guy who, like, can't even sing, right? Infidels. But, you know, Lenny came back on an encore. Thanks. They sang, "Rock, Rock, Rocking on Heaven's Door." Man, I'm telling you, Lenny, he's just, he's awesome. Oh, no. What, "Oh, no?" Hopefully, it's... I'll pull over up here. Damn carburetor. What's wrong? I just got to flush the intake manifold. Only take a second. There's a screwdriver in the trunk. Would you get it for me? Yeah, sure. Okay. You know, music today... is meaningless. It's made up by derivative retreads who wake up every morning, wishing they were Bob Dylan, John Lennon or Sly Stone. Or, in the case of Lenny Kravitz, all three. That fake.

She had this stupid vanity license plate that said "Flower Power." She was listening to some old, tired music and she tells me, "The first time I heard this song, we marched on the Capitol to protest the war in Vietnam." Yeah, well, my generation refused to bow down to the establishment. Your generation traded peace and love for corporate raiding and junk bonds. My generation brought the world equality and free love. Free love doubled the divorce rate. I can't handle this music. Hey, take it easy. Your generation raps over classic rock songs and calls it new.

Why does this keep happening? ♪ It's just not a part of the sound ♪ ♪ It's just the way that she moves ♪ ♪ That's got me so... damn mystified... ♪ Wasn't this guy in Menudo? You know, when they call it a "talent showcase" I assume maybe we're going to see some talent. I ain't drunk enough for this, man. Another round? You know, he has nice hair. Yeah. When we signed Poison, they went triple platinum and all they had was nice hair. Hey, yo, check it out. We're in the presence of royalty. God, hasn't he bought his own island yet? Oh, you didn't hear about his golden boy, Tyson Cruger? Mmm. Canceled the tour-- exhaustion. Nervous breakdown. Hey, Mike Carter. How you doing? Jack Schulman. I sent you Darcy King's demo. I get a lot of demos. You know, I'm her manager. She's up next. She's going to explode onto the scene. I swear it, man. You're going to hear it and you're going to kill to sign her. I'm sorry, man. My label's full up on girl acts, but, uh... Foley's label's looking. She writes her own stuff, man. It's insightful. It's brilliant. I'll see you later, eh, Carter? She's going to be a spokesperson for her generation. How you doing, Marty? How's the ulcer? I'm fine. Look, man, I'm, uh, sorry to hear what happened to Tyson Cruger. Oh, he just needed a little rest. Right. I heard he's finger-painting with his own feces. Look, I work very closely with my acts... but I'm not a baby-sitter. There's a million things that can go wrong. So, what do you think? He the next Latin crossover? Not tonight, Carter. I just thought that King Midas might want to share a little of the touch with a mere mortal, that's all. Come on, Marty, how do you do it? I mean, how do you always find the next big thing? Well, I just go with my gut. Right about now, I want y'all to give a big Mondo Club welcome to the young, talented, and the beautiful Miss Darcy King. Give it up, y'all. Sorry about that.

Bend the notes. ♪ It's not like it matters ♪ ♪ Not like you really care ♪ ♪ Not like it matters that I was always there... ♪ Yeah, yeah, that's fine, I guess but, baby, what you got to do is emote. You're not feeling the lyrics, all right? I got it, Jack, okay? Then why don't you do it, okay? You know, Dean, you still sound great. If you ever get the urge to cut another album, just let me know. Thanks, but no thanks. One ride is enough for me, partner. I'm embarrassing you? Yeah, you're embarrassing me... Marty, she's having enough trouble without this trailer trash in her face. We're never going to made deadline. Well, we have to. The label's pushing for a holiday release, and Trent is already greasing the wheels. Which holiday? Christmas or the 4th of July? Jack. What!? Can I have a word with you? Get this done. Hey, princess you look great. You always say I look great, Martin. That's because you always do. Hey, what's up, Marty? Um, can I talk to you outside? We're kind of busy making magic here, man. Yeah, well, um, it's important. All right. I'll just be a minute. We'll count the seconds. We are falling behind schedule. Yeah, I know, I know. And I think Dean's the problem. You know how these faded stars get, Marty. Always trying to weasel their way back in the spotlight, right? He's doing this as a personal favor for me. Yeah, okay, whatever. The point is, we sold 12 million units without Dean. I can't work with this guy! Well, you're not working with him. Darcy is. One word from me and she isn't. Do you understand?! Sitting out her contract will destroy her career. This is Martin. Yeah, Trent. Now? I'll be right there. Jack, I respect your relationship with Darcy and what you've done for her. Damn straight. But we are making an album here, and I think you realize the importance of finishing on time and on budget. Fine. I will give Dean one more week. Thank you. I'll be back this afternoon. Mmm-hmm-hmm. Open the door! Now, Darcy! You wanted to see me? Hey, Martin. Yeah. Great timing. Have a seat. I was listening to some demos. What do you think? What's that gut of yours say? Nothing. You see, if this is about the album... Well, how about this? They're called, uh, Glory Hole. It's neo-grunge out of Portland. Nope. Sorry. Um, listen, Trent, I know we're running behind but you know how Jack is. He has Darcy wrapped around his finger. Yeah, well, unwrap her. That's your job. I'm on it. Hey, how about this? Kind of an all-girl Smashing Pumpkins. ♪ You know you held me... ♪ ♪ It was you and me... ♪ All right, Martin. Looks like we have a winner. Hey, Martin... Look... I actually didn't call you over about the album. I'm afraid I got some bad news. It's about C.C. Carmen. He used to brag about doing a hundred through the canyons. I always knew he'd die in that car. If not that car, then something else. What? Wh-What do you mean? Well, somehow, I can pick the shooting stars. Platinum every time, but they all flame out. Hey, that's paranoid, man. Well, you have to admit, I'm the link. Dean, this isn't your fault. You did not put him behind that wheel, drunk. No, but I got him into this. And if I would have left him where I found him, he would still be alive. Do you realize how crazy that sounds? Do you realize that you and Darcy are the only ones left? Hey, guys, I'm home. Daddy! Daddy! My beautiful daughter. Oh, I missed you. Go finish your homework, Lauren. Oh, but Daddy just got home. That's okay. I'll be up in a minute. How was it? It was better than most. I went for a walk after. C.C. had such a beautiful voice. Why does this keep happening? It's not your fault, Martin. You can't live their lives for them. Maybe I pushed him too hard. You gave him a chance to live his dream. And where did that get him? Where did that get any of them? Don't answer it. It's Darcy. Martin, please. Hello. Martin, it's me. Jack's outside. Leave me alone! Okay, Darcy, calm down. He won't leave. I don't know what to do. Darcy, Darcy, listen to me. Lock yourself in the bathroom. I will be right there. Call the police. Martin... She's all yours, Marty. Don't talk to me, Jack. Marty... How did this happen? I finally told him-- I told Jack that I don't love him and I don't even want him as a manager anymore. And he just freaked out. He started hitting me and waving a gun and-and breaking things. I don't know what I'm going to do. He said he was going to kill me. Listen to me... that is not going to happen to you. I won't let it. You understand? Not to you, okay? Her boyfriend attacked her. Yeah, but she's okay, right? No, she's not. She's a mess. She is too vulnerable. She can't handle any of this. Trent, I'm pulling her out. We have to push the album back. You can't make that call. Advance orders are through the roof. She is a raw nerve. I don't think that she's going to make it. She's hot now, Martin. That girl could yodel into an answering machine and move ten million units. Get me that album. My clients are not just units, Trent. They are people... artists! Do you ever wonder what happens to them after the product gets shipped? Overdose, hmm? Assault and battery. Suicide. Mental breakdown. Car wreck. Trent, don't you see the pattern? Maybe the people that I've discovered aren't meant for this business, no matter how talented they are. This business can be cruel, Martin. And sometimes careers do end tragically. You don't believe, you watch Behind the Music. Now get me that album. You cannot use people up and then throw them away! Get me that album. I don't want Darcy to be another tombstone hanging on your wall. Come on, Martin, enough. We both know Darcy will do whatever you tell her to. You get me that album, or I'll find someone who will. ♪ Just thought you'd like to hear my thoughts ♪ ♪ On all that you do... ♪ What are we doing here, Marty? We're yodeling into an answering machine. ♪ On all that you do ♪ Never mind. ♪ Everyone's expectations... ♪ I'm sorry, I can't do this. Don't make me go back in there. Darcy, we are so close. I sold 12 million albums on my first try. What do you want me to do for an encore? Sell five million... and accept defeat gracefully. I had my whole life to write that album. I can't write another one in seven months. I don't care anymore. I don't feel it, Marty. I know you're tired. I know you need a break. When? After the album? After the publicity tour, the concerts? When? I can't take a break. Not now. I'm sorry. Please tell me what to do. I'll do whatever you say. I say, take a break. We'll shut it down. You just leave. What, I just walk away? The label will drop me. You're multi-platinum, Darcy. The label is not going to drop you. You just come back... whenever you think you're ready. What if I'm never ready? Well, then, I wish you a... very long life... okay? Okay? Okay? Come on. When you go, just go home, okay? Daddy's home. Daddy! Did you discover anyone today? Well, as a matter of fact there is this amazing new act. It's a family group. They've got a mother and a daughter and they are so beautiful and talented. Oh, Daddy. I've got a surprise for you. I did it, Sue. I pulled the plug. I sent Darcy home. What about the label? Screw the label. I... am... finished. I have a long list of chores for you during your retirement. Oh... it's probably Trent just, you know, calling to make it official. Hello. Hey, it's me. Guess who just showed up at the studio? Jack's out of jail, and he's in a foul mood. Where's Darcy? I already tried her place, but she didn't pick up. Well, she should be home. Listen, meet me there. Okay, I'm there. You're leaving? I'm so sorry, sweetie, but I'll be right back. This is the last time, I promise. Hello? Oh, good. You are there. Hey, Martin. What's going on? Jack is out of jail. Jack? He's already been by the studio. I can be at your house in about 20 minutes but I think you had better leave right away. Oh, God, Martin. I will take care of this, Darcy. Okay. Don't worry. Okay. Bye. Darcy! Martin! Are you okay? It happened so fast. Hey, hey, what's this? What's going on? You'll have to talk to the detective. Martin! Darcy, everything will be all right. Apparently, the girl mistook this guy for her ex-boyfriend. What happened here? You can't come in here. This is a crime scene. No! Dean! Help him. You got to help him. It's too late. It was an accident. This is... it was an accident. I'll take care of it. Don't worry about it. Be careful. It was an... I know, I know, I know. No. Morning, Daddy. Are you okay? I know what will cheer you up. My surprise. Ahh! No. Please, no. Oh, God, not her. Please, no. What do you think, Daddy? Will you discover me? Sure, honey. You have a rare gift. What's the matter? Oh, I seem to have lost my ring down the disposal and my hands are too big to fit in. Would you... reach in and get it for me? Sure. I don't feel it. Oh, it's in there. Dig deep.
