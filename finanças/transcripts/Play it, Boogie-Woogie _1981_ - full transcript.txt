It's a Mustang. Mustang, wow. What's your name? - Sachino. - Wow! Sachino Kobayashi. Boring, huh? How about you, mister? What? Your name. Mustang. Say, why did you pick me up? Maybe you're after something? What if I said I was? If you pay me, I don't mind. Aren't you still in high school? Yeah, but I barely go. Naughty girl. How much do you want? 1,000,000 yen. Don't make fun of an adult. I wouldn't even pay you 10 yen. Damn it! You idiot! So foolish. - What are you doing? - I'm touching you. Then don't touch me because it's creeping me out. What are you doing?! Stop! No! Hey, didn't he go a bit too far? Are you alright? Here. What's going on? Who is that man? I don't know. You don't know? Hey, get up. This makes it look like I did something. Hey! Oh. - Meow. - Huh? Welcome home. There was a phone call from your company earlier. You're really unbelievable. They say you haven't shown up to work at all. You put your brother in a difficult position. He suggested he'd turn over the CEO title to you. He's the one who pitted everyone against me. You should at least contact him. Since you get paid a lot for doing nothing. Is Sexually Transmitted Diseases Prevention Week over? You know, no matter how you look at it, you're a lucky guy. I would love to go back to work, but the company doesn't even exist any more. When you take a good hard look, you're pretty good looking. A bit rough around the edges, but... I can see why Keiko is attracted to you. I heard from Keiko, you haven't paid the 100,000 yen due two months ago. That's for the kid's education. Make sure you do what we agreed on. I'm sorry. I'm paying my portion. That's what we decided. If you're not going to pay, you're just a guest here. - Welcome home. - Good morning. - You know... - What? What is it? Never mind. Going running again? Yeah. I have to do it every night. That's what I decided. Hey, Teruo. Huh? I can lend you the amount you need. We can't avoid our responsibilities for the kid. It's okay. I'll pay. I'll figure it out. Hey! Don't touch that! Wow, you're drinking that quickly. Good, huh? My name is Goro. I'm Lune. What? Lune. Nice name, isn't it? Don't I look like a Lune? What are you talking about? You're probably more like Hanako or something. I'm actually Sachino. I hate it. It's so old fashioned. Sachino? That's a good name. Really? Yeah, a lot better than Lune. Shut up already! The "no" in Sachino is written with kanji. "Sachi" is written with hiragana and "no" is... like this... Stop it, it tickles. - Did you get it? - Yeah, yeah, I got it. Damn you! I have a handkerchief with me. What?! It's gone! My wallet is gone. It's the kind that has an address book and stuff. What? It wasn't on the road. It must be in the car. That car earlier. How much was in it? - 20,000 yen. - Really? That's a lot. About Materu... I have him staying with my sister. Isn't he a burden for you two as well? - Were you listening? - No. I hate kids. -Then it's fine. - Teruo hates kids too! We may not know which of us is the father, but he's still ours. I'll be good to him. Every day is a good day. Nothing bad happens! Isn't that right? Stop making a fool out of me. You're the one who came between Teruo and me. Don't talk about the past! Hello. What? Miyasato? A tracksuit? That's right, he lives here. Is something the matter? What happened? Yes, yes. I see. I'll be right there. I understand. As soon as possible. Thank you. Teruo is dead. He had a heart attack while running. He was found hanging over a fence. He died that way. Hey. Isn't there anything to eat in this house? Nothing but alcohol! Along with your sister... Why don't all three of us live here? How does that sound? Your relationship with Teruo is over now, so... The four of us, including Materu. Let's do that. How can someone eat at a time like this? Yokohama, huh? Kouhei Kobayashi Haruyo Kobayashi Sachino Kobayashi Excuse me! Hello? They were living together since July. The motivation for the crime was a complication in their love life. Next topic. Summer is essentially over. So, we picked up a few images that depict the end of summer. First, this is Zaimokuza Beach in Kamakura. With beautiful weather, people are enjoying the last days of summer vacation. What? Um... Is this Miss Sachino's home? Sachino? You must be her mother. Who are you collecting money for? Huh? What are you going to do to Sachino? I've ended it with my husband. So it doesn't matter how much he borrows. It's got nothing to do with me. You can't get money from me. - Simple as that. - I'm just here to bring Ms. Sachino's... My daughter's business has nothing to do with me. I'm not responsible for her. Are you a school teacher? No... Well, if she comes home... Please have her call me here. Our phone is dead. It may be a hassle, but here you go. Can I have a light? Thank you. Hey, what are you doing? Let's go. Where are we going? I'm going to work. A gyudon restaurant. I see... that's respectable. Hey, you! Do you plan on staying here? Can't I? What do you mean "Can't I?" How about school? I don't know. Suit yourself. Wait! Are you going home? I'll go home, but I'll come back. Huh? I'll need a change of clothes. You're just like a cat. So... um... Huh? I'm sorry, but... Oh! Here. I'll pay it back tomorrow. Okay. Welcome! Welcome! What can I get for you? What? To an extent, Teruo committed suicide. Maybe you killed him. Then you're an accomplice. Stop it. It was a suicide. The God of Death was calling him. That's why he went running every night. There's no mistaking it was an accident. He died as if our relationship... was at its peak. Um... what was your relationship anyway? What was Teruo doing in this place? Dear. He was like a friend. Like family... in the end... I don't understand! For conservative people like us... You! Maybe you two got rid of him? - Isn't that so? - No. I think... This is ridiculous. What shameless behavior. How did it come to this? It's simple. My company was selling imported goods... to the department store Teruo was working at. Small items. At that time, Keiko came to my company, to pitch an idea about an event targeting college girls at the department store. That's right. I went with Teruo and... met you... It was the Young American Event... that all three of us worked so hard on, wasn't it? It was like putting "Young" on anything just made it sell. What is "Young", anyway? I don't understand anything. Eventually, the two... meaning Teruo and Keiko, started coming here. We kind of started living together. We were supposed to be together, as one. Don't cry! I'm happy that the three of us lived here, but… What about your wife? Do you want to hear it in detail? Don't mention her at a time like this. Yes? What? Mustang? Yes. A girl is asking for the Mustang man. Mustang? Takeshi is it! It's all here. The money is all there, right? Thank you very much. Well, if you hadn't left your wallet, we wouldn't have been able to meet up like this. Why didn't you give this to my mom? Huh? Well, if I gave it to her, I figured your precious money would disappear. I see. Maybe you're actually a nice person. No. I need to thank you for something else. Hm? I wouldn't have met Goro if you hadn't thrown me out your car. Ah. That kid on the bike. I see. So that's how it is. What? You two won't work out anyway. It's none of your business. My house is right over there. Was the woman on the phone your wife? It's none of your business. That goes both ways. I'll give you a lift. - It's okay, I'll take the train. - The trains aren't very frequent. I can see that. That day we met was significant for me too. Someone close to me died that night. Thank you. Are you sure it's okay here? Yes, it's near here. It's pretty strange, when you think about it. For both of us. What? Autumn Hello! Oh, you brought her with you. Can I have something to drink? I'm working late tonight. Alright. So this is the girl I've been hearing about. What? Um... Don't get pregnant. Alright, I won't. When a kid ends up making a kid, it's the beginning of a tragedy. What are you talking about? He's a funny guy, right? And he used to be in a GS band. Their records didn't sell at all, and he was the songwriter! Shut up! They had several albums. You don't need to tell her such things. I'm Sachino. Thank you for taking care of Goro. Stop acting like my wife. - Give me whiskey. - Before work? It's fine. I can't be sober for a job like that. - Do you want to drink? - No. This? Say, Yacchan, is there someone who can work and take your place? Everyone else has exams coming up just like me. What? Are you quitting? Yes, after today. I'm in a bind. Hey, how about Sachino here? You've got to be kidding! I can't have her work in a place like this! Just listen to you talk. Acting like her husband now. Cut it out. What are you doing? I'm the owner! You fag! That's none of your business. It's my personal choice. I don't care if you're a fag. Alright? But this place has no customers! Why can't I read comics? At least I'm standing, right? You see... I'm just asking that you don't read things like this when a customer comes in. You can't be reading comics when taking orders as well. It's inappropriate. Shut up! I'm so busy and they put out a new issue everyday! Ouch! Hey! We can't run a business like this! Welcome. Come in. You're fired. Get out of here! I quit this queer place anyway! You've just ruined the broth, so you're not getting any pay for today. Understand? I don't want it, you creep! Damn it! You're very attentive for someone new. The boss tells me to be. She's supporting a good-for-nothing husband. Isn't that cute? This cute face has a husband? - Welcome. - Welcome. Hey! Hey! What the hell? Here. Huh? There you go. I'm home. Sounds like you're popular. Yeah? The boss said that you're meant for that kind of business. You have talent. If you're that good with men, you can do a lot more. It looks like you don't mind it either. What? I would like to buy a new bike. What are you doing? What do you mean "what?" Is it a problem? Do you know what I did today? I slept with an incredible woman who rode a Harley. I think she was using me. I got paid this much for it. See? Can you do that kind of thing? Do you want me to do it? You couldn't do it anyway. You pimp! Idiot! Hello? What? Mustang? Who the hell are you? Welcome. A Salty Dog. Oh? Okay, then. What's the matter? Welcome. Here you go. It's alright. You've become so sexy. I don't know what to do. He hasn't come back? It's just like I said. - Shall I make some? - Yes, please. - Boss, make it a light one. - Okay. - It looks like it won't stop raining. - Doesn't look like it. Why don't we go on a trip? Huh? Tomorrow. No, the day after tomorrow. Where to? Go buy some clothes with this. It'll make you feel better. - Cheers! - Yes! Cheers! I reserved a hotel for two nights. I have some errands to run. An off season resort in the mountains is pretty awesome. Say, do you think I could be a prostitute? Do you think I could do it? How would you feel about committing suicide with me? Double suicide? Die with you, mister? Me? Wow. Hey. There's a cliff up ahead. If I just drive straight, we'll fall and everything will be over. I've never done it before. So, do you want to? Okay, let's go! Go ahead! Alright! Stop! Stop it! Do you have juice? Aren't you going to answer? No need. I have it all planned out. I only do as I've planned. Huh? Tomorrow after breakfast, I'm leaving the hotel. I'll be back at exactly 6 pm. Can you wait for me? Sumire Piano Concert So, then... um... My responsibility as a lawyer is done. Thank you. Child support and alimony should be paid every month, as per the instructions earlier. Please don't forget, otherwise it will cause problems. And also, don't try to call or see Hanae. - I understand. - I believe that's about it. - Is that alright? - Yes, thank you. Yes. I'll be going now. Thank you. Hey! Is there anything else you want to say? Nothing. We haven't spoken in years, so it's all the same. I didn't need to get a lawyer, but I just wanted it squared away. Isn't Mari cute? That's why I had the lawyer come. Huh? I was afraid you would take her. Papa. This is the tape from today's Maiden's Prayer. - I had it recorded. - I see. Take it. Here! Papa, please look after it and listen to it all. Hey. Bye-bye! Hey, sir! Hey, hey, hey. - Are you alright, sir? - I'm okay! Watch out! I'm doing fine! I'm fine! Give me all of it! Shut up! Let me go, idiot! I'm sorry! The cassette! Give me the cassette! The cassette! Just put him down there. Cassette! Here. Is this it? Hey. Papa? Papa, good morning. I called like I should, right? Goodbye, papa. Papa? Papa? Papa? Huh? Hey. You guys haven't eaten, huh? Oh. Where the hell have you been? It's none of your business. Cute kitties. Welcome. Welcome. - It's so warm! - Welcome. Can you wipe for me? Alright. Hey, wait. - You're lucky! Lucky, lucky, lucky! - You've been polished clean! - Excuse me. - Great! You're buying tonight! She's really changed. Where's Yukie? - She's asleep. - I see. Oh, this has gone bad. She's been through some hard times too. She got married to her high school sweetheart, and then he died in a car accident. Is that for real? There's pickled onions. Ah, there it is. It's a true story. She had no place to go, so she ended up with me. And she's a little crazy. It's okay, you know. Huh? What is? With Yukie. Don't mind me. I mean it. I'd feel better that way too. Teruo... you... and me. I was too lucky. Two men for one woman. It should be the reverse now. One man and two women. Yukie is the other one. That would make you a lascivious woman. Offering your sister to me. Just to create your idea of a family. Would that help balance things out for you? Intellectual debauchery. That's right. You call that intellectual debauchery. That's a classy way to put it. Classy? What are you doing behind my back? You went to sign the divorce papers. Why is that? The girl that calls sometimes, Sachino. What's with her? Are you jealous? It's not like that at all. Welcome! Welcome. You're always alone. - Yeah, give me a whiskey. - Alright. - Do you want a bottle? - Yes. - Boss, boss! - Yes. Absolutely terrible. A complete disaster again. You know those predictions you sometimes make? Do one for tomorrow. - I can't. I don't get it right these days. - Don't be like that. - Come here, boss. - Okay, okay, I'm coming. We're waiting. We're going to get it right tomorrow. Here you go. Here's the bottle. Please look after things here. Just because we went on a trip once, it doesn't give you the right to follow me around. That was not my intention. Don't come here. Toilet. Is the jockey in black the favorite? For Papa He still has this stupid thing... What's with this music?! It's no good! I think it's fine. It's great! You don't understand music like this unless you're educated. You're either educated or you understand nothing. You can't even drink. Why did you come? What do you want from me? I'm in love. You liar. Then, why would I come here? I'm not your kid, playing the piano. I'm not a child. I'll come again. Be my guest. I won't come anymore. Be my guest. Thanks, boss. - Leaving already? - Yes. Oh, that cassette. Please throw it out for me. It's okay. Thank you for your visit! - What? She's not home yet? - Yeah. She left ages ago. I think she's with somebody. No way. She left alone. Thanks. What are you doing? What happened? Were you raped? Goro... Was it here? Have you called the police? They brought me here in a car... and told me they were going to call the cops, and I should inform them that I just got raped. Damn it. Who was it? I'll find them and beat them up for you! Tell me, who was it? Stop! How can you not tell me who they were? Tell me! They were in a car. They both had uniforms on. What kind of uniforms? School ones? I don't want to say. Two of them, huh? How filthy. Being raped by two of them... That's nasty! Couldn't you fight back? Like start screaming or something. You should have fought back, even if you got killed! What the hell are these things? I'll kill them! Hey, you guys! Did you come across anyone boasting about doing a woman? - No clue! - Don't fuck with me, punk! What are you doing?! I heard you got rid of her cats. Yeah. You love her that much? Not at all. If you didn't love her, you couldn't do all that. I was pissed. I was the one who got ridiculed. Hello. Nice place. Welcome. Please sit at the counter. What a nice bar. - Welcome. - Thanks. Let's get out of here. Hey, this is a nice bar. The girl is pretty too. Hey, what's the matter?! What's wrong with them? I'm sorry. I'll tell them off later. - Hey, come with me. - What is it? - Just come! - What are you doing? - Who are those guys you were with? - What? They did something terrible. Tell me! - Ouch, ouch! - Come on! We'll call the cops if you do something funny. What do you think you're doing, calling us at work? You're interrupting our business! Put that down. Hey, you, you should... Wait, you bastard! You bastard! Idiot! - You guys did it, didn't you? - What are you talking about?! Bastards! Stop it, please stop! Enough with that! You bastard! Damn bastard! Here! It's the cops! This is the police. Tell them that you were just assaulted! Hello? What's the matter? Please calm down. Hello? Hello? Hello? - Is that true? - Yeah. I wish I had chopped off their dicks as well! Like snip, snip. Idiot! That doesn't do me any good. I got revenge, but she keeps on complaining, you see. I hate it. - Thank you for getting your revenge. - What? You were only thinking about getting revenge for yourself, you weren't thinking about me. You called me filthy that time. That I should have fought back even if I got killed. Are you still upset about that? You're always thinking about yourself, and you don't care about me. There's no way it would've worked. And it's not. That's right. And that's fine. Cheers to me! Who are you calling, you whore? None of your business. It'll just be for a little while. That's fine. Another guest won't make a difference. We're just guests too. Hi, cutie pie. Huh? What is it? Don't touch the baby. Ahhh! Idiot! Idiot! What the fuck did you just say?! Welcome! Welcome! Let's play to the rhythm of the song and make sure you don't lose... to your friends or those sitting next to you. Keep on going and get those prizes. Today there's no limit, no bank day. We hope you take advantage of your golden arms, and be filled with luck today. Welcome! Welcome! Thank you! The miso soup goes well with toast. No, I don't want it. How about Sachino over there? I'm fine. I see. Here's the key. - See you later! - What's wrong? It's okay, it's okay. Stop crying. That's a good boy. What's the matter? Not very attentive are you, Sachino? I'm sorry. Hey! Welcome home. Hey. I don't want this. What? Why do we have to hide like this? But you have two wives. You know that's irrelevant. I guess... but I don't like it. Do you hate me? I like you, but I'm scared. Scared? Of me? That's ridiculous. I'm scared... but I love you. Let's end our relationship. It ended when Teruo died anyway. What do you want to do? I'm going back home. I'm going home too. That's right. Our mother isn't well either, so... Are you alright, sister? I guess there'll be one more sick person at home. I'll phone mother and tell her we're coming home tomorrow. That's what we're doing. What about the baby? I'll take him with me, of course. Whose baby is it? What good will it do to know that now? Hello? Mom? It's me, Yukie. Winter Sachino hasn't been back for a long time. I see. You came looking for her the other day too. Yes. I'm not anyone suspicious. What are you to Sachino? That guy... That bastard! So, you're the Mustang man. Damn you. You took Sachino, didn't you? Eh?! What? Don't pretend like you don't know! What did you do with my woman? Was she really all yours? - What? - She's not with me. Huh? She's not with you, right? Well, she's not with me. Is that true? Hey! Do you know anywhere else she could go? No clue. I've been looking everywhere. I thought she was with you. That would have been nice. But she ran away. From you too, huh? Those type of women are difficult. That idiot. Where could she be? She's a stray cat. I'll knock her out the next time I see her. Are you sure you could do that? What? Don't push yourself. Ouch, ouch. That hurts! Damn it, you're strong. What are you guys doing?! Ouch, ouch! Kill him! Kill him! Hey! Sir... Sir... Just leave the rest to us. Yamaguchi and I will take care of it. Alright? This is from Ohashi. You don't have to worry! - Please, take care. - Ah yes, thank you for everything. Is everything going well with Takasaki? Yes, it is. Come in. Shigeru is going. I'm leaving now. Hang in there! Yeah, thank you. Did you see it in the papers? It's quite serious and could take up to three months to recover. You're really the one who stabbed me. It sucks. I'm sorry. Who was better, that bike guy or me? Huh? At sex. Goro, right? He was looking for you like a crazy man. You should go to him. A kid deserves a kid. Right? Here, have some more. Good job! Goro, you've changed since that woman left you. - You're easier to hang out with. - You know, women... - Goro, one more? - You want it? Stop it. He's at his limit. I'm doing fine! - Alright, give me another. - Nice! Goro is a man! That's right! I'm invincible! Alright! Go for it! One, two! Impressive! Fool! I told you to stop. You shouldn't encourage him, he's only a kid. Maybe we overdid it. Hey, new guy, you wanna try? No, it's too good for you. Never mind. Who are you? A stray cat. I'm surprised you remembered this place. Where have you been? Salty dog. Meow! Woof! What are you up to now? I'm back. Your partner is back. Right? I'll never forgive you. What a liar. He's actually happy. Goro. I thought you were going to knock her out when she got back. Well, why don't you listen to this and think about it for a while?
