(running footsteps and panting) (monstrous screeching) (man yells) - What the hell's the rush? The opera doesn't start for another, what 15 minutes? Yeah, coulda had a couple more drinks back at Nero's. - Not to worry John, we'll stop around for a few on the way back, right? - Uh, yes. Thought you were in a rush. - How much longer can you put up with him? - I don't know daddy. (groaning and gasping) (screaming) (opera in foreign language) - What the hell are you looking at? - John. - Yes. - Please. You're embarrassing me. - Are you getting tired old boy? Come on. - Hey Paddy. Can I give you a ride? - No. I'm just going to take the bus. How did you know my name? - I know a lot about you. - No you don't. (thud) (panting heavily) (breathing heavy) Help me! Help me please. Please. Please. That man he's trying to hurt me. He's trying to kill me. Please help me. - Hey back off. (gunshots, screaming) (banging on door) - Come on Paddy. Make it easy on yourself. - Please. Please don't hurt me. - I'm not going to hurt you. They want you alive. (screams) (sirens) - You sure you want to marry this man Estelle? - George, she knows what she's doing. - Sometimes I wonder if I do. - Marry you? Why would I want to marry you? You mean nothing to me. - Hey, hey, hey That's enough of that. Right. That's enough of that. (thud) - Hey. (dull slap) - Shouldn't have done that. (thud) - Okay buddy. You'll be going with us. - Let go of me. - Yes you are. - I could buy you and sell you. - Are you hurt daddy? - No darling. I don't believe we've been introduced. I'm George Henderson. - Alex Stone. - My wife , Monica. My daughter, Estelle. I'm a research scientist at the Price Foundation. Look, if there's anything I can ever do for you, please don't hesitate to ask. - We really would like to thank you for your kindness and help. Are you sure there is nothing we can do for you? - We could have a light dinner. - I'd love to. (sirens wailing) - He better make it through this surgery. I'm too old to find another job. - Victor will be well taken care of. Since his father passed away, he's got more influence than the President of the United States. - Just like organized crime. (chuckles) - My father was offered a position at the Price Institute about six years ago. Coming here was a new start for all of us. And where are you from originally? - Let's not talk about me. I see you have other things on your mind. Like your fiancee. - How did you know he was my fiancee? - I'm psychic. - (laughs) I've... know John for a long time. We met whilst I was studying art in Paris. He was working for his father's firm in the city. But ever since daddy died and he inherited a small fortune, he's never been quite the same. What with his high rolling lifestyle and jet setting around Europe. We really have very little in common anymore. Tonight confirmed that. - You're a very special lady. You deserve better. You know nothing would give me greater pleasure than to be your knight in shining armor, but I fear in your current state of emotional vulnerability, such behavior would be... inappropriate. (giggles) Why are you laughing? - It's just that you... I don't know you just have a very funny way of saying things. - I'm a student of communication. I have another engagement. - Alex. - I really must leave. - Well that's fine. My chauffeur is waiting outside. (sirens wailing) - Dr. James is on his way. - Good. We'll go straight into the coronary unit. Connect the patient to an EKG monitor and commence oxygen therapy. Nurse, grab Victor Price's files from my office. Now, please. - We have to raise the foot of the bed. We have to stop hypertension. - Steven. - I'm here. I'm here. (techno music) - Get outta here. Gentlemen. You have my money? You know Victor and I are very pleased with your work. - So you should be. I'm good at what I do. - For your birthday. - Appreciate it. How about a blast for the road? - No that's strictly for people like you. See you pretty boy. - Thanks for the compliment. - Don't you dare let me die. - Everything's going according to schedule. We'll be operating soon. Don't worry. - Have the others been notified? - Yes they have and they've all agreed to come to a conference as soon as you've fully recovered. - New heart coming up. (techno music) - (gasping) (roars) - This is the police. Everyone remain where you are, and sit down on the floor. - Shut off the music. (music stops) (snarling) Everybody come out with your hands up. (snarling) Let's go in. (roars) - Oh God. Who could have done that? - Nothing human. (sirens wailing) (snarling) - Sebastian. No. (roars) Time for our departure. - This is no drug bust. What the hell? Am I dreaming? - You're not dreaming Pete. We're dealing with a nightmare. Vampires. (laughing) - Did you see the look on their pathetic faces? As they could no longer see us. - In your particular case I wish it were permanent. - Alex, I'd like to see that you're all safely here. But I must make you aware that the sun is soon to come up. (ominous music) (clanking) (heavy door closing) (heavy thud) (heavy thud) (heavy thud) (heavy thud) (heavy thud) (heavy thud) (heavy thud) (indistinct crowd chatter) - Victor. I'm sorry to disturb you, but they've arrived. - Good. - My father would be very proud today. For the initiations and accomplishments we have incurred. To further our control worldwide. (applause) In order for us to sustain control, we must aggressively continue our eternal life research, to a successful conclusion. So that every single one of you. All of you. Will be by my side for centuries to come. (applause) (creaking door opening) (exciting music) (hissing) (fleshy puncture) (bang) (roaring) - Good-bye. - [Woman] And that is our vampire hunter. - You're telling me this is real? - Absolutely. This is actual footage of Marshall Pope, he's the world's leading authority on vampires. He comes highly recommended by INTERPOL. - Why would a guy film himself killing vampires? - It becomes documented proof of his killings. - Must have one hell of an ego. - Well, we'll find out soon enough. He's on his way here. (twinkling) - It's really a bargain at $1,200. - Boo. - Alex. - I'd like to buy this painting. - A little sunshine in your life? - Yes. I could use it. - And, where would you like it delivered sir? - To my home. - Well, I'll see to it personally. - Will you have dinner with me this evening? - Is it a condition on the purchase? - Absolutely. - Well then I accept. - Very well. - Just let me grab my coat. Thank you. So your car or mine? - I don't drive. I took a cab. - Well in that case we'll take mine. (gasps) Let go of my purse. Don't. - Let go. - Alex. (gunshots) Alex. Oh my God. Help. He's been shot. - Are you hurt? - No. - I'd call the police if I were you, to make a report. (foreboding music) - Alex. Please. Wait. Listen it's all good and well that we made a police report, but I saw you get shot with my eyes. I know I did. - I must go. The night is drawing to a close. - But when will I see you again? - Please have the painting sent to my home. I'm sorry, still it must be this way. - Just like that? - I'm sorry. - (sighs) Alex. (country music) - Looks like my ex-husband. - He ever taken a bite out of you? - No, but you could give it your best shot. - Gloria. One of these days I think I'm going to take you up on that offer. - Yeah, sure. Promises. Promises. - (clears throat) Would you excuse us please? - Just when I was getting somewhere. - Pete, this is Marshall Pope. - How do you do? - Very nice meeting you. So you're a vampire killer huh? - That is true. I've been tracking and killing them for a long time. - How the hell did you ever get in that line of work? - I was made aware of them 10 years ago in New York. They attacked and killed my wife. - Marshall's not one of us. He used to be a button man for one of Germany's crime families. - Yeah, but I got jammed up with them. I got out with the German police, giving up all my connections. They gave me new face, name, place in the witness protection program here in the United States. - So how'd you end up with INTERPOL? - Well through the investigation of my wife's death, they realized they had a hit man they can put to use, as I had a personal vendetta to settle. - Okay. I really believe that we've had a run-in with them. We tried killing them. Couldn't. How do you do it? - I researched the bastards. Created special weapons to eliminate them. - I hope they're nuclear. - You've been following Alex? - Yes I have. I no longer trust his judgement. He's made himself a target, through his foolish involvement with this mortal woman. And if he keeps it up, he's going to expose us all. I've done some further checking into Estelle, and her father's involvement with the Price Foundation, where he works. It's owned by the Illuminati, which is headed by a man named Victor Price. They're a very powerful cartel. Strategically placed throughout the world. They control vast amounts of wealth, and governments. - If they're so powerful then why are they involved in a research foundation? - The Illuminati have been striving for immortality for years. Experimenting with cryogenics, memory transformation, cloning. But it's not working for them. And they're running out of time. - What about body parts? - Good question. They've recently abandoned AIDS-ridden Africa as a source for body parts, and have commenced random harvests on the streets of western countries. The body parts are keeping them alive, while they research into eternal life. They're determined to live forever. - What about Estelle? - I don't think she knows anything about Victor Price's involvement with the Illuminati. - Alex darling. We were just talking about you. - Yes. I know. - You've been spying on us. - Seems to be contagious Sebastian. Perhaps we should give the Illuminati the immortality they so desperately seek, and deserve. - Why deserve? - So they can live in the darkness. As we do. - Well that's enough of this. I'm feeling a little peckish, let's say we feed? - I have other things to do. (sighs) - Why can't I get you out of my mind? Did you see her? - I did. She's staying with her parents. - Did you give her the message? - I put it under their door. - Thank you. You're a good friend. - You have my total loyalty Alex. The other dismiss me, but you've always protected me. - And you me. (ominous music) - Well Josh is late again. - My mother would kill me if she knew I was out this late. - Yeah, this will make the third time this month I've been grounded. (roaring and screaming) - Mary? Jean? Where are you guys? (roaring) (clicking on keyboard) (door chime) (door chime) - Boo again. - Alex. Oh. Why do you continuously brush me aside? - I came here for Chris. I need your father's help. I can't go on as I am. - I don't understand. How can my father help? - Through research. I have a physical problem. - What kind of a problem? - I'm immortal. A vampire. - You can't be serious. - Unfortunately your eyes were not deceiving you the night I was shot. - Oh my God. - Meeting is you is like finding a part of myself that's been missing for many lifetimes. I want to hold and touch you, but I can't. And I know we have a future together, if only your father could find a way that I could live as a normal human being. - You want mortality. - Yes. - You would actually give up immortality to have a life with me? - Yes. - Kiss me. - I can't - Kiss me. - I can't - Kiss me. - I can't . I can't. I can't . I can't kiss you. In my current physical condition I can't have a relationship with a mortal without killing of affecting them. (ominous music) (camera clicking) (police radio chatter) - Hey I don't want the press here. Get them outta here now. Damn vultures. - You're not gonna like it, but this looks like our vampire cult. We better inform INTERPOL that we have a definite link between the recent killings in France and Germany. And by the way, pardon the pun, but we better stake this place out over the course of the next couple of nights. - Why? - Just like any other animal, they mark their territory. If they feel this a good hunting ground, then I'll be there when they decide to hunt. (birds chirping) - Estelle. You seem a bit preoccupied this morning. Something troubling you? - Yes there is. I just don't know how to explain it. - Well I'm certainly willing to listen. - Well as you know, there are some strange occurrences in science and... Oh what the hell. I'm madly in love with Alex. - Mmm. Well, from a scientific perspective, that's fantastic. What could possibly be wrong with that? - He's a vampire. - Ah. Is he now? Darling you're willing to call men a lot of things, but I'm reasonably sure Alex is not a vampire. - Oh yes he is. And he needs a cure. He needs your help. - (laughs) That's slightly preposterous . Even if he were a vampire, what could I possibly do to help him? - Well you have the knowledge and the tools. - You're serious, aren't you? Let me get this straight. Alex is a vampire and he wants me to cure him. - Yes. He is an immortal being, but he wants to become normal so that he can share his life with me. - Vampirism is real. My studies in longevity, have long confirmed that. Do you realize he could be the answer to my research into eternal life? You realize that? Of course I'll help you. - Daddy. Daddy. - Well done. - Thank you. Thank you. - Victor the shipment departs tomorrow at noon. - All the necessary preparations to move the drugs have been completed. - Well done Ricardo. - Are you sure you have enough firepower at the drop? - I know.I know. The shipment is worth a lot of money. - Steven. As always I'm depending on you. - I understand. - Why are you bringing me here in the middle of the night? - I got a job for you. - It'll cost you. - I think you're gonna like this one. It deals with a shipment of cocaine. - I'm with that. - We can't go on like this any more. Moving from city to city. Country to country. Always on the run from the authorities. This is no life for me. Or any of us. I don't want to live like this any more. - (laughs) You fool. Do you really think you have a choice? What do you want out of life anyway? We're all nomads on an immortal path. What do I want? This is what I want. I want to feel the warmth of the sun on my flesh. I want to see nature's beauty in the light of day. I want to swim in the ocean, run in the forest. I want to be a man. I want heirs, children who'll carry on for me after I'm gone. - You're being so foolish. - You've been lying to us. It's Estelle. - How dare you humiliate me. Get out. All of you. Now! - What, are they here? Patience. You've gotta have patience. They will show up eventually. - I guess we got about an hour before sun up, then we can go home. - And then you can go to sleep. (laughs) - There is enough powder here to last a lifetime. - Amigo, you keep playing with this stuff, it's going to be a short one. (sirens wailing) (gunshots) - Hands behind your head. - Move over. (gunshots) - You want a piece of this? - Be my guest. - You can't touch me. I know my rights. I'll press charges. - Oh yeah. Well here's one more charge for you to deal with. - (grunts) - $250 million. $250 million gone! And I want an answer and I want it now. - We can only guess is Brad's guards got under surveillance for some time. - You can only guess? Surely you would have known that. You should have checked and checked and rechecked again. And what about our police contacts? - I assure you this surveillance was not carried out through the usual contact. - Oh you assure me. Assure me what? Where the hell's Rex? - I saw Rex get shot. As for the rest of them I can only assume they were either arrested or killed. - You know what, shut up Ricardo. Steven, If they've been arrested, get them out. If they're dead have them buried. (hospital monitor beeping) - Do you think this is gonna help him? - Try not to worry Michael, huh? - Marshall I missed a great drug bust the other day because of these damn vampires. Now we can't just keep sitting here, night after night waiting for something that doesn't come. Well, if I were you I would lower my voice. Just take a good look. Get on the radio and alert the others. - Guys. Guys move in right now. Target is approaching. Shooters move in now. (snarling and growling) - Save us Sebastian. Get us out of here, like Alex would have done. - Transport us now. - You know I don't have the same power as Alex. We must leave and come back to fight again. - What are you giving him now? - A very strong sedative. I want to keep him calm and quiet. - Well done Henry. You can expect a nice little bonus attached to your paycheck. - Thank you. I really appreciate it. - Well looks like Dr. Henderson and his daughter Estelle have the keys to immortality in their hot little hands. - You're not suggesting that you want to become a vampire? - In the line of work we're in Simon it's not that much of a stretch. - By the way, we've located Rex. - They're moving him from the general hospital to St. John's mental institution. (buzzer) - I don't like it. I don't like being here. - Look, as long as you cooperate and tell me what I want to know I can keep you safe. - If I tell you everything I know, I'm a dead man. - (guffaws) You're such a dead man anyway. But, you do have one chance. - What do you mean? - We can provide you with a new identity and relocate you. - You're talking witness protection. - Yeah. - All right. I'll tell you everything I know. - Good evening Henry. - Good evening. - I'm here to check on your report. - Right this way Victor. - See Victor? Exactly as I said. - So this is how you spend my money. Dealing with vampires. - This is despicable, how dare you spy on us? - He's my employee. His loyalties belong to me. I wish I could say the same for you Dr.Henderson. Oh. Who and what is this little creature? - Don't speak to him as if he were some animal. He's a good loyal friend. And a decent human being. I wish I could say the same about you. - I want to know what's going on. And I want to know now. - You're right Victor. Perhaps we should explain. I've been experimenting on this young man. - You mean vampire. - Yes. But this vampire could be the key to your immortality. - Go ahead tell me more. - The subject, Alex, is definitely immortal. And he has an insatiable desire to lead a normal existence. - What a fool. I would give everything in the world to have what he has. - Perhaps you can. Let my father continue here and in exchange he will provide you with immortality, but only if Alex agrees. - Whether or not he agrees is irrelevant, he has no choice. But nevertheless I'm willing to allow you to continue your research and give you $10 million. If and only if he gives us what we want. - Alex was right. We have nothing but misery to look forward to. - Sylvia. How dare you imply that Alex was right. - Leave her alone Sebastian. She mourns her friend Jennifer. - I'm not responsible for her or Chris' death. Marshall Pope, who has killed others of our clan seeks to annihilate every one of us. We must stop him. - No sign of them yet. - Do you really think they're going to show? How the hell are they gonna find you? - Scent. Through the smell of my blood. Just like blood hounds, they have the uncanny ability to track down every victim they want. - But what makes you think they're going to come here tonight? - Revenge. We killed two of them. It's not in their nature to take any challenge lightly. They need to face me. - Well I think we're going to be ready for them. - I don't believe it. It's so simple (laughs). - If you run out of blood you could always use some of mine. - Michael that won't be necessary. There's enough of a supply here for at least three more weeks. - Not to worry. I have the answer to Alex's condition. - You've determined the cause? - Yes. Alex has a virus. This virus has mutated, driving him to consume whatever blood is in his body. Including his own. I have to find a way to eliminate the virus. (snarling) (speaking foreign language) (snarling and roaring) (speaking foreign language) (loud beeping) - He's in trouble. - Let's move. (gasping) (crashing) (roaring) - Hit the switch. - Hit the switch. - Now, we will make you feel, like you make us feel. (groaning in pain) (roaring and screaming) (sizzling) - Jesus. - So, have you made your decision? - No, I won't provide them immortality. - As vampires they will not have to feed on humans, they can survive on transfusions as you have. - Do you know who Victor Price and his people are George? - Alex, what are you talking about? - They are a worldwide cartel. They cause war, famine, and unrest for profit, In their quest for ultimate power. - If this is true, then why not take advantage of their power, by gaining control of it? - Perhaps we can. - With all due respect Alex, that can be very dangerous. Your powers have weakened. - George, can you momentarily regress the treatments for mortality? - Whatever you say. - Bring Victor and his people here. I'll give them what they want. - All right. - I gave you some very valuable information. When are you going to cut me loose? - INTERPOL are sending two men to transfer you. You're leaving the country. - Where am I going? - England. - Good. When? - They'll be here this afternoon. - I'm very very pleased. You've all cooperated with the amount of funds requested. - This promise of immortality had better happen Victor. - There is another issue to deal with. - And what might that be? - Obviously we're not going to conclude our deal with Estelle and her vampire. - There are a lot of witnesses. They could put us in jeopardy. - Larry? - It will all be handled when we get what we want. There will be no witnesses to worry about. - One we have successfully transformed, Steven will take care of any and all witnesses. - What about the janitor? Henry. He could be dangerous. (thud and moan) - Victor, I thought we had a deal. You can trust me, I wouldn't say a word. I wouldn't say a word. You wouldn't hurt me. (cracking) - Like I said, no witnesses. (laughing) - What do you want? - I've got your clothes. You're being discharged. - It's about time. - So I'm moving to England. Where am I going to live? - In the cemetery. - You guys ain't cops. - You just answered the $64,000 question. - Victor Price says hello. (gasping and moaning) - We're here to pick up Rex Harrington. - I don't know what you mean. He's already been released. - What the hell you talking about? Who picked him up? - Two of your guys. They took him out of here a couple of minutes ago. - You better call headquarters, let them know we lost our boy. - Well whoever they are, they just saved INTERPOL a lot of time and money. Good riddance. - Yes sir. Yes I know it's very embarrassing. Yes sir I will contact your office as soon as there is any information. They snatched him from right under our noses. How powerful can they be? - Well you think they'll ever catch him? - No he's brown bread man. He's gone. He's dead. We've been ordered to take part in the INTERPOL surveillance of Victor Price's operation. So, I believe we're going to have to be doing some bird watching. - How are you feeling Victor? - Wonderfully well. That was a delicious sleep. How are you and the others? - We are all feeling strong and rejuvenated. - We will live up to our promises . Once we're assured and confident that the procedure works. Obviously there will be other testing. - Oh I am sure that you will obtain your quest for immortality. However my father did say that it will be several hours before you actually see results. - Good, then let's go back to the mansion and wait. - What guarantees do we have that all this really will work? - You will achieve your immortality. Now I must get back to my father. - Not so fast sweetheart. You're coming with us. - Simon, you and the others take Estelle back to the mansion and on your way out have Steven come and see me. (knocking) - Haven't you got anything better to do than to scare the hell out of both of us? I mean it's bad enough that we called out on this damn surveillance and we gotta sit out here like a couple of stooges. - Look I don't like this any better than you do, but the commander's been riding our asses since they lost that little creep this afternoon. Now, tell me what you got. - Tell me what you got. All right. My men have been staking Victor Price's mansion out, when they saw him leave with 10 others. They tailed him back here, where we took over. They entered that building, the Price Foundation, where they've been ever since. - Come on. Get in. It's going to be a long night. - Ricardo I need you to take me back to the house. - Steven come here. I want you to finish off lover boy, Dr. Henderson, and that little creature. (laughs) - How do I kill this vampire? - A stake through the heart. - Okay. - It's time to go. - A stake through the heart, yeah. (whittling noise) - Hey. Hey there they are. But it looks like Victor Price is not one of them. - Okay you two follow them, we'll stay back here. - What are those buffoons up to? - I don't know. - Hey, what are you doing here? - Greetings from your daughter. She's doing very well over at Victor's mansion. How's our patient? I'm trying to wake him up, but he's in a very deep sleep. - Yeah, let's keep him that way. (grunting) (gunshot) - We better get in there. (screeching tires) - You all right? - Let's get Estelle. - We must hurry. I know the way to Victor's house. - There's something I want to show you. We have over 528 sites throughout the world that generate money for us. And money brings us power. And in our case, eternal life. And with money you can have anything you want. Any man you want. Estelle, why waste your time with Alex? - I love Alex. And with or without money, he's the only man for me. - Love, what is love? This is what I love and cherish. This is the most powerful love potion in the world. That's what love is to me. (sighs) (car engine) - Hey. Hey maybe we should go check it out. - No. We have orders. We sit tight. - Estelle you really should reconsider and join us in our journey to immortality. - Alex got away. - You fool. - Okay they're here. Let's go. - We have the arrest warrants. It's time to make our move. - Good. (running water) (thud) - Hey. What the hell are you doing? (splash) - We got company. - Obviously Steven failed to complete his duties. It's difficult to find good help now a days. I assume you want your money? - I want to destroy you for everything you represent. - Oh, we're not immortal? - Alex would not give you and your people eternal life amongst us. Knowing that you would eventually destroy all of mankind. - You promised me immortality. (gun hammer cocks) - And I kept my promise. I gave you immortality. - Put your weapons down and get your hands up. Now. - I think it's time for our departure. (laughs) - Here we go again. It's the magic hour. - Where in the hell are we? - Hell is a good description. - You promised us immortality. - I kept my promise. You have your immortality, here forever. (roaring) - Honey it's been over a year. I haven't gotten a ring. - I'm gonna make an honest woman out of you very soon. - Excuse me. We were wondering if we could interview you about the outcome of the Illuminati's trial? - Get lost. - The courts today cleared Estelle Henderson and her father of all charges. George Henderson will continue his scientific research into longevity. There's been no further word on the disappearance of the Illumintai. Nor the vast amounts of money they had deposited into banks around the world. It has been determined that the money vanished along the same time that Victor Price did along with his band of thieves and murderers. In the last year, it is this reporter's opinion that there has been a harmony amongst the people of the world as crime is at an all time low since the eradication of the Illuminati. Another point of interest, there have been no further sightings of vampires. And good riddance. - You know Pete. Regarding this immortality thing. I wonder what happened to the vampire we didn't kill. - I've just transferred $30 million into the Wright Institute of Advanced Learning. Of course the donation will remain anonymous. - Estelle you have done wonders with the Illuminati's money. - It's all going to go back. Where it should be. ♫ You came from the darkness of cold night. ♫ You turned your face from morbid shadow. ♫ You said I'm longing for the light. ♫ So I can be with you. ♫ I saw that look on your face. ♫ Sweeping me up in yon grace. ♫ The look in your eyes from another time and place. ♫ For we belong together and I will be forever ♫ Immortally yours I will be forever immortally yours. ♫ We belong together. ♫ I am yours. ♫ Immortally yours. ♫ Don't tell me this cannot ♫ Be love.
