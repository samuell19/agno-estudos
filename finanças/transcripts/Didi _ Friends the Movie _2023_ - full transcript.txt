Let us all play games together Singing, dancing side by side Joyous fun with each other Didi & Friends! Woke up today with a smile on my face Today is a happy day Good morning. Hi, everyone Let us all Hora Horey! Wow, look at all these books. Do you even have time to read all this? Nek Kura's one of the elders of Horey Town. Most of them were written by her. Nek Kura must be really smart, right? Of course. Hi, Pak Atan! You wanted to meet us, right? What is it? Do you want me to decorate anything? Any broken thing for me to fix? No. Nothing like that. Mayor, I think we can tell them now. Pak Atan told me... ...that the three of you would often help him... ...and are great at it. So, we are planning to..... All of us have agreed... ...to appoint the three of you to organise... ...this year's Horey Town Anniversary Concert... ...and Didi! You will lead the pack! Really, Pak Atan? Of course. Who else do I trust more... ...besides the three of you? Plus, I am... ...going to be the main star of the concert. Really, Pak Beruang? Congratulations! Yes! I want to announce it to everybody in town! How exciting! Are you seriously going... ...to let him be the main star? -Nek Kura! Yes, I may be old. But my ears are still able to differentiate... ...between a good singer and a bad one. He's been pleading us every year. Let's just give it to him this year. So, Didi? Jojo? Nana? Are you ready? -Don't worry, Pak Atan. I am more than ready! -That's great, Didi. Do this together, okay? By doing it together,... ...even the ordinary can be extraordinary. Alright. I will make sure... ...that it will be the most extraordinary... ...Hora Horey concert. Sitting there, alone and lonely No one to keep you company Pak Beruang, are you okay? I am fine. Just trying to practice my singing. You don't look okay, Pak Beruang. Aren't you happy to be the main star of the concert? Of course I am. I've waited a long time for this. It's just that..... Just what? -It's just that I feel... ...like I don't have the best singing voice. You can't say that, Pak Beruang. I want our concert to be perfect. Perfect? Oh, no. I have to do more practice! Will I make it in time? Have you noticed how enthusiastic Didi's getting? That's normal, Jojo. He's just a bit too excited. He probably just wants this to be the best concert ever. Both of us want that too, not just him! We have a big problem! Forgive us, Nek Kura,... ...for bothering you this early in the morning. I'm sure you are busy, right? Not that busy. I was just preparing the dishes for dinner. You're preparing for dinner in the morning? That's too early. I am a tortoise. I start early... ...because it will only be done at dinner time. Hi. -Pak Beruang. Are you okay? I am not. You sound so cute! How about you tell us. How did this happen? Yesterday, I ate a Haha fruit. I heard that... ...the Haha fruit can make you sound better. But after I ate it,... ...this is how I ended up sounding. Where did you hear that Haha fruit make your voice better? I told him that. -What? The other day, I read... ...about Haha fruit in Nek Kura's book. So, I... ...gave Pak Beruang the fruit. Let me see the book. I knew it. You misread the book. What do you mean? -The Haha fruit... ...only removes bad voice. No! I don't want to lose my voice! See, Didi? You shouldn't be willy-nilly. I was just trying to help Pak Beruang. May I ask where you're going? I'm getting the book of remedies over there. Wait. There are lots of herbs to be collected to treat him. There are eight... Just eight. That's not that much. ...hundred and sixty-four. What? 864? How long will that take, Nek? Is there any other way? There is. According to the legend written in the book..... Far across the Hora Forest,... ...there exists a magical cure that can heal all illnesses. The cure... ...is deep inside a cave on a floating island... ...filled with all kinds of obstacles and challenges. The island is called The Legenda Island. Yay, it's an island trip! Joni, Joni. -Yes, papa? Keep quiet. I am not in the mood. Isn't Legenda Island just a myth? Can we trust the book? Of course. I wrote it! Okay then. Let me be the one to go. I will help cure Pak Beruang's voice. Didi, are you serious? Look. It's far away! Nek Kura,... ...how can we go if it's a floating island? Fret not! We will take a flight on my airship! Pak Atan has an airship? E-I-E-I-O! Yes. My airship is no ordinary ship. It can fly! Aren't all airships supposed to fly? That's awesome! If that's the case, surely I can be... ...your co-pilot, Pak Atan. -Didi! Maybe it should just be me and Pak Beruang. Come on. Please, Pak Atan. Just as the co-pilot. Shipmate? Cooking staff? I don't think so. Don't you believe in me anymore? It's not that I don't believe you. But..... -You're going to mess things up. I know I appointed you as the leader,... ...but unfortunately,... ...you're also the reason we're in this situation now. I know you want to do your best. Maybe you're just not ready yet. I hope you'll learn from this mistake. It's okay, Didi. Let's just focus on concert preparations, okay? That's right. There's still a lot of things to do. Okay. Thank you, Pak Atan... ...for your willingness to help Pak Beruang. You're welcome. If I don't do it,... ...then who will? Right, Pak Beruang? Thank you. -Who said that? It was me. I thought it was a kitten. What are we waiting for? Let's get ready! Let's go! Didi, Nana, did you notice... ...that the map Nek Kura showed us... ...contained treasure! Do you think Pak Atan will bring it back too? Come on, Jojo. We're trying to help Pak Beruang. Why speak about treasures? But, it was unexpected, right? Legenda Island really does exist! I hope they will find the cure. Then, they can bring home the treasure too! Isn't that right, Didi? What's the matter, Didi? Are you upset that you can't go with Pak Atan? I know I did wrong. That is why I wanted to go get the cure. But... ...now I can't go with them. Even if Pak Beruang is cured,... ...I still have made it hard for everybody. Come on, Didi. It's fine. You don't have to resolve everything by yourself. That's true. They just don't want to put you in danger. It's not easy to go there. Okay, Jojo. Nana. See you tomorrow. ...that the map Nek Kura showed us... ...contained treasure! It was unexpected, right? Legenda Island really does exist! I know you want to do your best. Maybe you're just not ready yet. This heart of mine Has never known defeat I only need To be given a chance Why won't anybody trust me? I'm ready! I didn't intend to hold you back Not that I withhold your chance But this is just beyond your ken You are not ready yet. Just stay here. But I am prepared for this! I will prove it to everybody. I can do it! It's already destined No need to shed any tears I only need To be given An opportunity Believe me Now is the time Just believe and keep believing Until I achieve everything I'm now ready for anything I'm going to keep on running And I will just keep on proving Believe me, I will be back Just believe Just believe Just believe Just believe Just believe and keep believing Until I achieve everything I'm now ready for anything I will just keep on running And I will just keep on proving Believe me, I will be back And bring success with me Just believe Just believe Bringing success with me Bringing success with me! What ship is that? Are Pak Atan and Pak Beruang back already? Both of you saw the ship too? We did. Was it Pak Atan's ship? Where did the ship go? Nek Kura? Nek? Oh, Nek. What happened? Nek Kura! Are you okay? -I'm fine. We thought we saw Pak Atan's ship. That wasn't his ship. It was a pirate ship. Pirates? Yes. They came here to find the map to Legenda Island. What must we do, Nek? Will they come back? I am not sure. But Pak Atan and Pak Beruang might be in danger. Quickly. You need to inform the Mayor now! Okay! Didi, what's the matter? The Mayor's house is over there. There is no time for that. We have to help Pak Atan and Pak Beruang. You mean, you want to chase the airship? We can't fight pirates! That's dangerous, Didi. It's okay. If you won't do it, I can do it myself. Didi, wait! You're going to run all the way? If you insist on driving, at least do it carefully! Didi, Hora Forest is dense. It's dangerous. Don't drive too fast. Prof. Gogo is only lending us the car. Oh, no. I can't see it anymore! What is that? Get them! Turn around, Didi! Turn around! We're done for! Jojo, can't this car shoot anything? Of course not. Do you think this is a tank? Here. Ready, Nana? Sorry! Found it! What is this, Jojo? -It's a tracking device. In case we get separated. Come on, Jojo. Don't say things like that! A fallen tree! That was close. Where is Nana? Didi! Jojo! Help! Nana! Didi! Jojo! Didi, turn around! What must I do? Oh, no. We are done for! Which pirate is this? Jojo, use the tracker and find Nana. Okay. Move. Now! Come get me. Fire! Didi, I found Nana's location. Goodness, Didi. I think... ...Nana is in that Zee airship. It's Zed, Jojo. They're the same, Didi. Whether it's Zed or Zee. What to do now? Now, hold tight! Blink, take her to the cabin. Aye aye, Captain. Come with me. It's not safe here. Wait here, okay? Hold tight. Didi, up there! That's the ship that took Nana! I see it! Didi, be careful! I am so hungry. Why are we stopping, Pak Atan? Is the ship having problems? No. Look there. There are Alli Vera plants out there. I want to go get some. I want to replant it in my farm. Aren't we in a rush? I know. But the Alli Vera is a rare plant. This is the first time I found it. But..... Come on. It won't be long. Look after the ship, okay? I will bring back some fruits. You're hungry, right? Okay. Hurry up. Alli Vera. Gecko Vera. We're already in a rush and now I'm stuck with the ship. Who's there? Pak Atan? Wait. Hey, little one. Where are you? He's gone. Oh, no! Stop! Another rock. Ouch! There you are. Ouch! There is nowhere to run. What happened to you? Are you okay? Okay. Where am I? Captain. -What happened? We were attacked. By who? -Captain. Satria-Z's shipmates. Tell me,... ...where is Satria-Z headed with those Horey Town kids? Don't tell him. -Okay. No! Hip! Don't be scared. You're safe here. My name is Zee. I am the captain here. And you are? Nana. My friends..... Are they safe? We have sent our crew to locate them. Why is Torra after you? Torra? The gang that attacked you. They are part of a pirate crew led by Torra. Torra is the most feared treasure hunter in Muzika. Many have fallen victims. They were robbed, pillaged. Everything was destroyed. All maps and valuables have been seized by them. The Satria fleet's been trying to track him for a while now... ...but every time we were able to close in... ...he got away. Nek Kura said that... ...they are looking for a map to Legenda Island. Legenda Island? Isn't the island a myth? Blink, inform Commander Satria. Aye aye, Captain. -Zee. Aside from my friends, Pak Atan and Pak Beruang... ...are also in Legenda Island. Can you save them from Torra? We can try, but..... Captain, I have radioed the Commander. And? The Commander refused to deploy ships... ...to find an island that doesn't exist. He wants us to report back to HQ. -What? That's because we're Satria-Z. If it was Satria-M, he would have listened. What to do now, Captain? Let's return to..... -Wait! What if I can show you the way to Legenda Island? Here. It's done. Are you serious? Can we trust her, Captain? Are you sure this is the way to the mythical island? Yes. It was Nek Kura who drew the map. Alright. Let's go to Legenda Island. Aye aye, Captain. This time, Torra will not get away. Don't worry. We will rescue your friends. Come on. Let me introduce you to my crew. Captain Zee and the crew!

This is nothing. They were just joking around. Tok, please untie us too. Don't you want to know what they're cooking right now? It smells good. I think we're the dish. Really? How could they..... Come on. Let's go! Can we trust him? He seems odd. Do you want to go with him or end up as dinner? That was a great technique, right? It was. But they seem better. Do we have to do it again? Wait. What is this smell? -It's not me. Really? Can't you smell that? It smells like... ...pirates! I am looking for two kids from Horey Town. Where are they? It looks like you don't know who I am.

They're not in pursue of us anymore. Are they afraid of water? Of course not. They're just afraid of heights. Are you scared of heights? -We do! Good. Hold tight. This is all for show! The coast is clear. Thank you, Tok Chip. What did you do to get those pirates coming after you? It's a long story. Long? It's fine then. I'd rather not fall asleep in the middle of the river. Oh, no. What? -Nana is not on radar anymore. Give it to me. -We don't even know... ...our location right now. Tok Chip, do you know... ...which way is to Horey Town? How should I know? I don't go to that kind of place. You see, Didi? You kept rushing into things. You should think first. See? Where are we going now? -How is it my fault? You're the one who got us caught. What's with all the noise? All the fish are getting away! I don't know what's the problem with you two. But what I do know right now... ...is that I am hungry. Why don't you come with me? Let's go get some food. After that, we'll figure things out. Okay. Where are we going to eat, Tok? We're going to the most exciting place in Muzika. Enan? Erol? Can you hear me? Status report. Over. Enan? Erol? Satria-Z, Erol here. Captain. Erol? Yes. You guys are safe? Yes, we are. The Horey Town kids are also with us. Didi and Jojo are with you? Is that true? It's true. Jojo and I are safe. Hi, Nana! I am so relieved to hear from the both of you. I was so worried. Captain, we'll bring them in to the ship first. The team are headed to Legenda Island, right? Yes. We're heading there. How did you know? Didi and Jojo told us about it. So, where do we meet up, Captain? Let's meet in Skyway City. Over. Aye aye, Captain. Apparently, your captain... ...is not that smart. Good news.

Maybe it can help you on your journey. Didi, look! Tok, do you know this symbol? The ship that took our friend has the same symbol. But with a Zee. -It's a Zed. This? This symbol? This one? This symbol..... I forgot about it too. Don't worry. We can ask around. I can help. Let's make a move tomorrow. Really? You can help us find Nana? Yes. It's no problem.

What should we do? -Broken? That remote is not broken, Juju. It just doesn't know how to point upwards. Skyway City! I'm sure your friend... ...must be up there somewhere. For sure! But how do we go up there? We don't have a ship. Aren't those garbage drones? Wouldn't it smell? -Tok Ship smells worse. Okay. We're ready to take off now. Supplies are all replenished. Erol and Enan still haven't answered. Never mind, we'll move out first. We'll try again later. Sorry. Excuse me. Nana, hurry up. Captain Zee is taking off soon. Okay! Ready? Now. Wait for us, Nana. We will come for you! How long will this take, Tok? Come on. We'll be there soon. Let's just enjoy the view. Look. Is the remote okay? It's okay. -I'm fine. I am. Nobody asked? Over here, over here! Come on. We're close! Why is Nana's pin here? Where is she? Oh, no. Looks like the pirates who kidnapped Nana found the pin. Our efforts have been in vain. What are you doing over there? These kids. Yes! Finally, we've tracked Nina. You're Nina? Wow, you have such a thick mustache, Nina. Nina? Is she the girl with the pink ribbon... ...and has your height? Yes. That's right. She just left in a Satria ship. I didn't get to return the pin that she dropped. She just left? This is all for show! I'm so excited for this free concert ticket. But where is this Horey Town? Captain, there is nothing at..... -Pod, check this out. Captain, there is something here. It looks like..... Hey, what gives? -Where is Yana? Yana? Who's Yana? If you're going to lie, be more confident! Tell me quickly? Where did you hide Yana? Relax, Tok. Don't let the pirate escape! Who are you calling a pirate, hey pirate? Aren't you two..... -How dare you, pirate! You've kidnapped their buddy and now you want them too? You two, stay behind me. Let me teach them a lesson. Wait! Don't worry. The Captain can handle him. Nana! Hana? Where is Omar? Didi? Jojo? Didi! Jojo! Nana, are you okay? The pirates didn't harm you? Pirates? They are no pirates. They saved me. Sorry for attacking you just now. You know, I'm a spirited young man. Hold on. If Didi and Jojo are here,... ...where is Erol and Enan? Who are they? If you're not pirates, why do I smell the stink? Erol? Enan? Are you two okay? We're fine. But... ...I'm hungry. Torra ship! Torra is back! This one here is a legit pirate ship. Hip, accelerate! Attack! You..... Back for more? Blink, get them to the emergency ship. Now! Don't let the pirates get the map. But, what about you and the others? Will you be okay? Don't worry. I am here. That's enough. Go. Tok Chip. Let's go. Spy-Ken, find the map. Captain Zee. I heard that you were ordered to find me. I don't care much about that. But... ...I hate it most... ...when people dare to meddle with my plans! You shouldn't be hasty. Now you're stuck. Blink, take care. Don't worry. We'll meet again. Turn the ship around. We have to help them. Are you serious, Didi? We can't be reckless! That's right. Captain Zee told us to take the map and run. That's it? We're just leaving them? Didi, now is not the time to be a hero. Move. Let me do it. Captain, they have run away with the map. Where are the kids? Forget it, Torra. You will never get them. No. Go, go, go! Didi, just let go of the map! No. I can do it! Didi! Finally. No one can stop me now. Nana? Jojo? Nana! Jojo! I'm down here! Nana. Jojo. I only wanted to help Pak Beruang. If you guys won't go, I'll go... ...on my own. I'll do it myself! I know you want to do your best. Maybe you're just not ready yet. I never thought That things Would turn out this way All I wanted Was to be of service to all But oh well Is this how disappointment feels? Only now do I realise It's not easy for me to admit I can't do this alone I've only been dreaming I thought I knew everything But I just can't afford to lose My only true friends I only wanted to do the best for everybody. I didn't mean to trouble anybody. But I was wrong. I couldn't do all that. If only I'd listen to them,... ...none of this would've happened. Nana, Jojo,... ...forgive me. There is no one Who has never made A mistake Pick yourself up We will keep on Fighting Just believe We can still do this Don't be sad, my friend Don't cry Don't give up We have to believe There's still time You don't have to be alone No need to be alone Come what may We have to believe That we will still make it When we do it all together The two of you are always with me... ...even though I always rush into things... ...and always ignore what you tell me. Now he gets it! But you are still our friend. And this time, we will finish this together. Okay, Didi? -Thanks, Nana and Jojo. Alright. This time, we'll do it together! Didi and Friends!

Who dares disturb my slumber? I'm sleepy! Sleepy Mummy, Sleepy Mummy I need to slee..... Pak Beruang! Run! Didi? Nana? Jojo? Pak Atan! Pak Beruang! What are you doing here? What? There are pirates on the way here? Yes, Pak Atan. They're willing to do anything... ...to get their hands on the treasure! There's treasure here? But we're only looking for the cure,... ...not the treasure. That's right. Torra and his crew are ruthless, Pak Atan. We'd better hurry and get the cure... ...before they arrive. I don't exactly know what is in this cave. Whatever happens..... If we do it together, it will be easier, right? Okay. This time, let's do it together. Let's get the cure for Pak Beruang! Let's go! Okay. Everybody, follow me. Ant Queen! Okay. Hold on. Give me some time to solve this. I did it. Piece of cake. As long as I have time, I can figure it out! Jojo? I think we don't have much time this time around. Oh, no. What now? You can do it, Jojo. You can! But I can't think with all this going on! Don't worry! We believe in you! That's right. You can do it! Hurry it up, Jojo! -Be quiet, Pak Beruang! Okay. Calm down, Jojo. Breathe in. Breathe out. No more puzzles, please. You're awesome, Jojo! Is that the cure? You believe in me, right? Be careful. Yes! Thank you for making it so easy for me. Torra! -That's for Pak Beruang. Give it back! -Yes. Just take the treasure. Why must you seize the cure? That has nothing to do with you. Look! Do you think I'm a kitten? Pak Atan! Jojo! Catch! Where should I take this? Here! Here! Pak Beruang! Help! Help! I got it! I got it! Drink it quickly, Pak Beruang! Didi, no! Didi! You should've never interfered with my business. You think you're the only one? Zee! -What? Just Zee? How about me? Attack! Stop them! I'm not scared! This is all for show! Take this! You want another round? Charge! Hey, leaving so soon? Story's not over yet. I don't have time for all this nonsense! Give us back the cure. You better step aside before I..... Take this! You lost, Torra. You don't understand. Oh, no. Who is it now? Please don't hurt my father! Gitta. -Father? Please. We promise we'll leave. Forgive me, Gitta. I failed you. What happened? Not so long ago,... ...our village was hit by an outbreak. Many died because they didn't get treatment. And those still infected... ...were exiled to ensure that the disease won't spread. Gitta became one of the infected. We tried everything to heal Gitta. We went everywhere... ...to find help... ...but... ...nobody wanted to help. Nobody cared that we suffered.
