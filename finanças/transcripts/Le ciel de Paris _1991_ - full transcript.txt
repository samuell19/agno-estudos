TO FERNANDO Hey. You cheated. No! No! I hope it works out. Of course it will. It's not that simple. - It never is with her. - It's not that. - Because love is serious? - Exactly. Suzanne wants a man who truly loves her. - Why do you say that? - Because it's true, isn't it? Right? Hurry up, I'm in a rush. - What time is your date? - Now. It'll be fine, you'll see. - The last guy was married. - So what? I can't stand it. - You can't stand married men. - It's not that. I get nightmares. Every night I dream I'm escaping a tunnel by torchlight. Don't laugh, it's not funny. It really scares me. Listen? Think of other things, like your date. Yes. - I might write a song about my dream. - Sure, write a song. You're horrible! Marc! I knew it! You've made me miss my bus! - We have? How? - Run! You could still catch it. Shit. Clothilde's dramas make me laugh. Don't, it's not funny. She'll get over it. Have you cracked? Still think about him? Yes, but that's normal when you've loved someone. You? - You know me. - Oh, I do. They come and go. - Good night. - 'Night. Hi, Suzanne, my sweet. Hi, Théo. - Hello. - Sorry I'm late. The metro, eh? Yes, all delayed, plus it's raining. - Last-minute strikes. - Yes. You think the metro's running, then poof! Suddenly they stop and go on strike. - Be a darling. Coffee, please. - Coffee? Okay. I'm visiting your mother down south next weekend. - Did she tell you? - No. - Calls from the south are expensive. - I need sunshine. I don't know how you can stand Paris. Weren't you happy down there? I stay in sunny places as long as possible. Exactly. The longer you wait, the harder it is to leave. You forgot the towels. - Check the bottom. - And my swimming cap? Ah, I forgot it. I thought so. Those caps are hideous anyway. - You keep photos of me? - They're just in the bag. - That's a bad photo. - No, you look great. Let's go home. I'm tired. No, come on. You carry on. I'll wait for you here. Marc! Marc! - Are you cold? - No, I'm fine. What's your name? Lucien. - Sure you're all right? - Yes. I just fainted, that's all. I'll call a taxi. You shouldn't walk. Right? I'd better go. Do you come swimming often? No, not very regularly. I come to let steam off. Maybe give me your number in case I don't see you? If you like. I'll give you my work number. Just while I find something else. I'm currently living with my dad because he's unwell. Goodbye. You got his number. - What? - Nothing. Yeah, it's the guy from the pool's. - Shall we call him? - You call him. I will call him. - Are you busy? - No, come in. I have a favor to ask. Oh, coffee first. - Coffee? Tea? - Got any chicory? - No, that's disgusting. - Coffee, then. What's wrong with this? You're mixing jams? Yes, it tastes good. So how did it go? - I think I'm going crazy. - Why? I keep having those dreams. And your love life? Just fine. You spent the night together? Then what's the matter? Is Marc here? No, he's gone to work. My dreams are really scaring me. I get a ringing in my ears. Listen, you don't need to worry anymore. You've found a fiancé, you're writing nice songs, you're fine. Suzanne, can you take me to choir? I'm scared to go. What time is it? Ten to nine? What will I tell the boss? - Your house flooded. - She used that two days ago. - Metro strike? - She used that yesterday. - I can't steal her excuses. - No. Just say...? Say it was personal. Works every time. - Personal? - Yes, personal. It's gorgeous. It's the last one. - My treat. - Thank you. Quick as you can. He shouldn't be long. You'll like him. - Thanks. - Thank you. You have a gun? Yes, I bought it the other day. Don't worry, I won't use it. - Still having nightmares? - Yes. - Thanks. - Thank you. There he is. - In the red car? - Yes, what do you think? I can't really see. I'm off. All right? I'm giving them back. That's why you came? Isn't that what we'd agreed? Yes, but? Take them? Are you sure? Why not keep them and think about it, eh? I know it's silly, but you could keep them and see? You screamed at me to give them back, so I'm giving them back. Take them and that's that. Excuse me? Three of each. Three copies, please, Lionel. - Can't you? - I'll be right back. Identity services. Hello? I need an address for a phone number. Thirteen francs seventy-five per minute. What's the number? Forty-five, 74, 29, 50. Clément Leduc Printing House, 14 boulevard des Anciens Abattoirs. Thank you. LEDUC PRINTING HOUSE I was in the area so I thought I'd drop by. This is Marc, a friend from Paris. - Hello. - Hello, young man. That's my dad. - Is this his printing house? - Yes. How is Suzanne? Actually, we wanted to invite you out one night. She's fine, yeah, just fine. Does Saturday night work? All right. - Meet at the pool, eight o'clock? - See you Saturday. - Give me a minute. - See you inside. - It's nice to see you. - You okay? Yes, I'm fine. Coming inside? No, I don't have time. Do you need something? No, I just came to say hello. - Sure you don't need anything? - No. Call Mom and Dad. They worry. Here, in case you need it. I don't. Come on, don't be silly. Come over sometime. You never visit. - Promise you'll call me? - I promise. Take care of yourself. I was starting to worry. - Were you at the pool? - No, I saw my sister. To ask her for money again? - Why do you say that? - Because you always do. I don't ask her for anything. I saw Lucien this afternoon. - Who's that? - The guy from the pool. He suggested hanging out on Saturday? if you fancy, of course. We could go to Noctambules. That's what I was thinking. Do you know this place? No, I don't know Paris that well. What will you drink? I'll have a gin. - And you, Lucien? - I don't know. Try a noctambule, the house special. Oh, yes, I'll have one. Okay, a noctambule. Right, three noctambules. Yes, sir? - Three noctambules, please. - Sure. What do you think? It's nice. Next dance all together? No, I don't want to dance. Wow, you're grumpy tonight. Another dance? I'm going home. You're being a bore tonight. Good night, Lucien. Bye, Marc. I'll head home too. Will you take a taxi? No, I'll walk to the station. My train's in half an hour. - Goodbye. - Bye. Don't walk so fast, there's no hurry. - Are you insane? - No, I'm not insane. - Actually, I'm great. - You're drunk. Yeah? Come on, let's dance! Don't you want to dance? You're plastered. I'm not plastered, I'm just happy. Yeah? You're mistaking being drunk for being happy. - Come on, let's dance. - Leave me alone! I'm sorry. I don't know what came over me. No, it's my fault. I've had too much to drink. No, I'm not swimming. Come on, you always say that. - You two go, forget about me. - What if we stick to the sides? - Come on, we can't force her to. - Off you go. Where shall we go this summer? What about... Bulgaria? Maybe, there's the Black Sea. Try again. Sicily? No, that's too close. Try further up. She just wants to try the North Pole. The Arctic Sea? What now? I'm going home, time for bed. We could get a coffee? - Suzanne, home or coffee? - If I drink coffee, I'll fall asleep. No, coffee wakes you up. Come on, Suzanne. Come on, Suzanne. You two go on, I want to go home. We'll go home together. I'll hail a taxi. - You're not mad at me? - I am. Why can't it ever just be us two? I'm in love with you. Being in love takes two, Lucien. Exactly, there's three of us. Even down to two, you'd still be alone. Suzanne, I've got a taxi. Bye, Lucien. I'm exhausted. Don't you think Lucien...? What about him? - Nothing. - Go on, I'm listening. Do you think he's in love with me? Why? Are you in love with him? No, so I'm scared to hurt him. You're talking nonsense. I think we're good for him. He might leave the printers and move here. Isn't that good? Why do you say that? Because. That's what I think. What's the matter? Nothing, nothing. Are we swimming tomorrow? I can't, I'm seeing Clothilde. She's single again. Day after tomorrow? Does Lucien know? No, I'll call him. Don't, I'll do it. - Good night. - Good night. Shall we convert the first floor? To make your room bigger. You could move in properly. I'm not moving in here. No, but while you're here, you might as well be comfy. I'm not staying, Dad. I'm moving out. Where to? Paris. Paris? What for? When will you leave? Once I've found an apartment. Lucien! - No Suzanne? - She couldn't come today. Up in the sky fly away our sweet fiancés To tunes that are not easy to dance to How long does it take Swept along by the mistral For an airplane to up and fly the coop? Up in the sky fly away A pair of long-haul flights Kerosene turning their passage into smoke How long until the next stopover? I'll keep waiting Perched on my leatherette suitcase Up in the sky fly away our sweet fiancés Air hostess, please serve them some coffee Just before they get back on their horses Shattering our dreams on coral reefs Plenty of fish in the sea. It's a love song. They're always love songs. Are you cold? Want a jumper? No, I'm fine. Here. - Is this yours? I've never seen it. - Keep it. You're crazy. It brings back bad memories. But it'll keep you warm and won't remind you of anything. Take it. - Shall we grab a drink? - One last length. Are you okay? Yes, I'm fine. Did you and Suzanne argue? - Have you fallen out? - No, not at all. Suzanne and I aren't an item. We live together, but we're not together. I wanted to see you alone. I'd better go. Let's go somewhere else. Your place? Not possible. Your place? No, I don't really have a place. Do you live with someone? No. Well, yes. We share a place. Are you not from Paris? I live in the hotel there. Where are you from? The hotel there. Yes, but originally? A little village, you won't know it. I saw the light on, so I knocked. Marc is out. You can stay, if you like. - Want something to drink? - No, no. Here. The countries you dream of. Polar bears. I couldn't come swimming today. - Marc explained. - Explained what? - That you're not an item. - It's no secret. - You really want to leave? - Yes. Life doesn't feel real here, everything's done on autopilot. Will it be better elsewhere? It'll be different. Then leave. That's what I'll do. A farewell kiss. - Suzanne? - Yes? - I just got back. May I come in? - Sure. - What are you looking at? - Places I'd like to go. The North Pole? I like places with no people. What if it's full of people? Postcard sellers, or ice cream sellers? Something wrong? No. Go to bed, you look sleepy. You're right. Good night. Good night. Have you been here long? Quarter of an hour. I like it here. Yes, it's like a shelter. Clothilde, I have a favor to ask. - Do you want to sing? - No! My friend's looking for a studio apartment. Isn't your neighbor moving out? Yes, but he's long gone. He was renting cheaply, so it was quick. That's a shame. If you fancy singing, let me know. Will do. Right? Open your books, page 55. Three, four... I think this boy is here for you. Hello. I wanted to ask if you'd come with me... to look at apartments. - Bought any newspapers? - Newspapers? - For the classifieds. - Oh, yeah. No, not yet. I'll call you, then? Goodbye. You know, Suzanne... Nothing. He's nice, that boy. He's just a friend. You believe in friendship? Friendship lasts, love fades. Theories like that change day by day. Tomorrow, you'll say the opposite. Do you know the song "Sweetheart, Come Let Us See If The Rose"? I'm not that old. I should spank you for that. You should take care of that boy, he needs it. You can't force these things. - Ever been in love? - Yes. Then you know it's a nice feeling. - I thought you didn't like flowers. - Only because I sell them every day. - They're scentless. - Don't be silly. Give me a hand. I saw Lucien. - Where? - He came by the shop. - What for? - He wants to view apartments with us. He seemed strange. Did he mention me? No, not specifically. What was strange about him? I don't know. It's just a feeling I got. Don't want to tell me? What's the matter? I don't like you talking to yourself, you're holding things back. - You've lost your mind. - Okay, bye. LEDUC PRINTING HOUSE - We're closed. You are...? - I'm here for Lucien. - Wait here. - I've been before. I don't know you. Wait here. What do you want? Either talk or go away. I want to talk. Not here. My dad will be back. Come on, the house is next door. I'll just wash my hands. Fancy viewing an apartment with me? I saw an ad. I'll come with Suzanne. All right. We could get dinner afterwards. - You've always lived here? - Yes. Well, no... since I was eight. Where were you before? In Pont-à-Mousson. Where is that? In the east. It's a small town. And your mother, where's she? She's dead. - How long have you known Suzanne? - Three years. I met her in Bordeaux, on holiday. She was with a guy. Is she still with him? No, but she still loves him... I think. I'm off. See you tomorrow? I can't give you what you want. You know what I want? Lucky you. Marc, are you there? Are you crying? No, I washed my hair. - Are we going out? - No, I can't. Are you tired? Stay in. It's for the best. You won't go out, but you'll leave. We'll go out tomorrow. I've been thinking... if you leave, why not take the table in the back room? - The round table? No, keep it. - I'd like you to have it. I can't give you money, so take the table. - Why do you say that? - I know you haven't left yet. But when you do. Anyway, everything will need selling when I leave too. - Dad! - Take it. - It'll be too big to fit. - Then sell it. I don't like you talking like that. Here. This will fit. Screw your trinkets. You reek of death, talking like that. We all reek of death. Furniture is like a tomb. Haven't you understood that yet? - Perhaps we view life differently. - Perhaps. What do you think? A bit small, isn't it? You won't find much on your budget. It is pretty small... and noisy. I can find better, right? - You're not in a rush. - No. Come on, let's go. - Where to now? - Got your bathing suit? - Not on me. - Me either. Let's pop home and get them. We haven't been for ages. Coming? Suzanne? Come on. Wait here, I'll go. I got red for you and tartan for you. - What? Something wrong, Lucien? - It's fine. - Shall we go? - Yes. Suzanne, a guy keeps staring at you. You're popular. Where is he? Behind Lucien. You can't see him from there. He's handsome too. I'm sure he's your type. - What do you know about my type? - I know what I know. You don't know anything. I guess not then. Lucien, turn and you'll see him. - He's joking, there's no one. - Typical from him. You didn't look. At least look. What's up with you today? Are you just out to annoy everyone? Observatory - Port Royal. I think it's great, you moving to Paris. What do your parents think? His mother is dead. My dad's not very happy about it. He keeps asking me about you. You're an adult, do what you like. No, he just wants to know my friends. Don't expect me to be his mate. Seeing your dad once was enough. He looked at me like I was the devil. - What if we went to see him? - Without me. His dad's all alone. Why shouldn't he meet his friends? And once Lucien's left, he'll be all alone. I'm not sucking up to an old man so you can rent an apartment. It's your money, not his. So what? We'll go without you. That'd be nice. - Could we go on Monday? - Of course. Will you come? Okay. What will you drink? A mint water. Two mint waters, please. Thanks. Can we meet up tomorrow? - To do what? - To chat. I can't tomorrow. Monday, then? We're going to my dad's. Before that. Okay, café opposite the pool at five o'clock. Oh, I'm thirsty! What's the plan for Monday? I'll meet you off the train from Saint Lazare. Okay. - Shall we go? - Yes. What shall we take Lucien's dad? What do you mean? I don't know... flowers? A bottle of wine? - Bring flowers from the shop. - You're right. It'll be nice to see his dad. Have you met him? Like I said, I saw him once. - What's he like? - A dad. Hold on, Suzanne. That won't work. Hold it like this and turn it. See you tomorrow. Suzanne, Théo, be on time. Do you get it now? Ah, Suzanne, I'll be late tomorrow, don't worry. Take your time. Take the keys. It's easier. - Have a good evening. - You too. - Hey! - Oh, sorry! - Your boss is bonkers! - I think she's in love. I'm leaving. - Where are you going? - Canada. - When? - Next week. Who are these for? A friend. - See you tomorrow. - See you. Excuse me, may I borrow your card? Is it important? I'm in a hurry. It's pretty important. - Is it a Paris call? - Yes. Thank you. WAY TO PLATFORM - Has Marc called? - No. We said we'd meet by the station, but he isn't home either. May I use your phone? Why would he be? If he's held up, he'll join us later. I'd still like to call home. No, come to the house. You can call from there. Good evening, young lady. It's wonderful to meet you. Lucien's told me all about you. Here. Thank you. Sorry, has Marc called here? No, no one has called. May I give him a ring? I'm a bit worried, he should be with us. Of course. It's in the next room. Thank you. I don't understand. Something must've happened to him. It's not like him not to call. Maybe he's met friends. You know how it is. No, I don't. I don't see what you're saying. Maybe he's forgotten. Let me take your coat. How about we go to the table? Young lady, please make allowances for me. I'm no expert in the kitchen. My friend's an amazing pastry chef. Lucien? No, I'm fine, thanks. What area would you like to work in? I don't know. There must be things that interest you, a young girl your age. She said she doesn't know. No, nothing in particular. What about printing? Would you enjoy that? It's hard to say, I have no experience in it. - Did you enjoy that? - Yes, it's great. There aren't many left. Lucien will need new machines and computers. We should've already bought some. Dad, I never said I'd take over. He wants to leave. He's always wanted to leave. If he doesn't want the printers, you can't force him. Right, young lady, it's been lovely meeting you. - I hope to see you again soon. - Me too. - Lucien, see her out? - Yes, Dad. Was what I said okay? Have I upset him? No, don't worry. Actually, I think he likes you. He seems sad you're not taking over. That's nothing new. He was weird about you leaving. When it comes up, I don't know whether to shout, shut up or leave. - Shall we go? - Let's. I like this station. Sometimes I walk here just to see it. It's true, you love walking. A ticket to Paris, please. Five francs eighty. Thank you. You've met my dad. I can't stay in that house. But you're moving to Paris. - Won't you live with me? Marry me? - What are you on about? Don't you want kids? - You don't just decide like that. - Why? I want you to be my wife. I want us to find an apartment and have kids. You're insane. Maybe. Are you scared? No, I'm not scared. I think it's lovely, getting engaged in a station. It's a good start in life. Those kinds of marriages last. Love marriages never do. What you need is an heiress. - So you're saying no? - Enough, Lucien. I'm going. - Shall I walk you? - No, I'd rather be alone. Can you go a bit faster, please? Suzanne! What's wrong? I'm sick. I must have eaten something off at lunch. Was it nice? Why didn't you answer the phone? I felt too weak. Yes, it was nice. - What about his dad? - He's sweet. Have you taken any drugs? There's no point. I've had it before. It'll pass. Was he happy? - Yes, I think so. - Did he mention me? We thought you'd been held up. Will you sleep with me? Change in here otherwise you'll be ages. Tell me the rest. I took the train, you weren't there and Lucien was waiting at the other end. And then? Then we went to his house, his dad was expecting us. What did you eat? Roast pork. Classic. Budge over, that's my side. Hang on. I'm glad you came back. I was worried you'd sleep there. Don't we have indigestion meds? No, there's no point. I'll be fine. - Good night. - Good night. Should we stop seeing each other? I'm sorry, I wasn't myself. I think we should stop. What will Marc say if we stop? He can say what he likes. Can't we forget what happened? You can't just rewind like that. It'd be a shame to end things. Will you come swimming? I don't know. If you sink, I'll look for you. - Is Marc not here yet? - No. - Sorry about Monday. I got held up. - It's all right. - I thought you'd stopped swimming. - With me, she isn't scared. How's the move? Found somewhere? No. Can't he use Clothilde's apartment? - Who's Clothilde? - Our friend. She's going to Canada. She's leaving her apartment? We're seeing her tonight. We can ask. You're seeing her, I'm going out. Then go out. - I'm seeing a friend. - I told her you'd be there. Well, I won't be. Will you ask her? Yes, it should be fine. That's the best way to find apartments, knowing people who are leaving. I'm off. I'll call about the apartment. That's right, get lost. - Why did you do that? - Why not? Go and get him. Just tell him once and for all. What, are you a madam now? Lucien! I'm sorry. - Fancy a drink? - What do you want to tell me? - I'm gay. - Is that all? I'm in love with you. I've already told you, Marc, I can't give you what you want. What are you scared of? Me being gay? Scared I'll fuck you in the street? Do you think it's an illness? Is it abnormal to love someone? You're the abnormal one. Tell me you don't love me, and don't lie. - I don't love you. - Lies! Any desserts, ladies? - What'll you have? - Raspberries. Me too. Raspberries. - Coffee to follow? - Not for me, thanks. Yes, one. Thank you. That was really good. You liked it? I'm glad. When you leave France, farewells are a must. How are your dreams? Rough. Last night the plane crashed. - Won't you see a doctor? - It won't make a difference. Leaving is the only solution. You can visit anytime, you know. - Canada? - Yes! Thank you. Raspberries. Tell me, Clothilde? is anyone taking your apartment? I don't know. - Have you and Marc fallen out? - It's for a friend. I'll give you my landlord's number. - Who is this friend? - A guy we met at the pool. - A friend of Marc's? - Not specifically. He's my friend too. Are you in love? Why do you ask? - Any luck with the apartment? - Yes. Let's call him. You call him. I'll call him. Hello, Mr. Leduc? Good evening, it's Suzanne. Sorry to disturb you. Yes, I'm fine, thanks. And you? Yes, of course I'll come back. Is Lucien there? Does his dad fancy you? First the son, now the father. Hello, Lucien? Good news about the apartment. She'll call her landlord tomorrow and then she'll call me. But it should be fine. You should see it first. Okay, here's the address... It's 87 rue de Charenton in the 12th arrondissement. Yes, at two o'clock. Okay. Lucien? - When is Clothilde leaving? - Tomorrow. He hung up. I'm in love with Lucien. Did you tell him? Yes. What did he say? He scarpered. Fancy a drink? No. How is Clothilde doing? She says she wants to start over. Do you think that's possible? I don't know. Why, do you want to? Yes. What about you? I don't know. Are you mad at me? Why? About Lucien. Why would I be mad? - Never been here? - No. Come, let me show you. Can we go in at night? Of course. Lucien! - Is it far? - No, just up here. - What's wrong? - Nothing. Is it about yesterday? - Has he calmed down? - No one's happy about it. - Come on. - No. - Come on! - Let go of me! Damn it! Forget him. I can't see you anymore. No!
