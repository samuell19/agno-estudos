-‬Not very well‭.‬ Your boss is wounded‭.‬ Hard‭?‬ ‭-‬Enough‭.‬ We have to keep crawling‭, ‬and fast‭.‬ But I won't be able to drag him away alone‭.‬ Guys‭, ‬can I crawl up to you‭?‬ Hold on‭, ‬Mikola‭.‬ I once dragged a goat to the vet like that across the field‭.‬ She sighed heavily‭.‬ And you're no heavier than her‭.‬ I'm not a goat‭!‬ ‭-‬No‭? ‬Capricorn‭?‬ Easy easy‭...‬ What are you looking at‭?‬ All my life I wanted to have a son‭.‬ And God only gave me daughters‭.‬ I already have 4‭.‬ Varka‭, ‬Sonja‭, ‬Nadja and Oljenka‭.‬ Do you have a family‭?‬ Don't chatter‭, ‬arrested‭.‬ I'm going to get some rest‭,‬ so we move on‭.‬ And don't even try by accident to escape‭, ‬arrested‭.‬ What‭?‬ Boys‭!‬ Should I crawl up to you‭, ‬or not‭?‬ Boys‭!‬ ‭-‬No need‭!‬ The lieutenant started talking nonsense‭.‬ She's afraid she'll die soon‭.‬ Okay‭!‬ You're a fool‭.‬ You haven't seen real life‭.‬ They filled your head with nonsense‭.‬ You do not distinguish good from bad‭.‬ I understand everything better than you‭!‬ ‭-‬Really‭?‬ Then‭, ‬let's go‭!‬ Did you rest‭?‬ Vasjuk‭!‬ ‭-‬Ah‭!‬ Rest‭.‬ We'll wait until it gets dark‭.‬ Okay‭!‬ Aren't you sleeping‭?‬ And why aren't you in the party‭?‬ I am not politically savvy enough‭.‬ I'm not old enough‭.‬ How come you're not up to it with your higher education‭?‬ What difference does that make‭?‬ Sometimes higher education matters evaluate people correctly‭.‬ And‭, ‬please‭, ‬politruk‭,‬ stop questioning me‭.‬ Each of us has the right to decide whether to enter the pariah or not‭.‬ It's a matter of choice‭, ‬isn't it‭?‬ Of course it is‭.‬ Can we switch to‭ "‬you‭"?‬ If you insist‭, ‬we can try‭.‬ Still‭, ‬I wouldn't rush‭.‬ I would first liberate 5-6‭ ‬such villages from the Germans‭.‬ Yup‭.‬ ‭- ‬And then I would see what and how to proceed‭.‬ You do not believe me‭.‬ What's wrong with me‭, ‬Yevgeny Ilyich‭?‬ You know‭, ‬I‭ ...‬ I went to the front as a volunteer back in June‭ '‬41‭.‬ I got shot and exploded immediately accustomed‭.‬ Here in the mine explosion they knew how to be stronger‭.‬ But I can't get used to it to such silence‭.‬ Usually after silence nothing good follows‭.‬ You said yes yourself The Germans do not fight at night‭.‬ That's right‭.‬ But for most fighters‭, ‬this is their first night on the front line‭.‬ So that‭...‬ I think now is the right time to visit them‭, ‬Jefim Borisovic‭.‬ Here we go‭.‬ Let them remove the barbed wire and set checkpoint‭.‬ Tell them I'll check in person‭.‬ Let the others deal with the new recruits‭.‬ That would be all‭. ‬Execute the order‭.‬ Let me address‭,‬ comrade lieutenant colonel‭. - ‬I'm listening to you‭.‬ It was getting dark‭. ‬They could try to send people and ammunition to the commander in the village‭.‬ We will send them after the German attack‭.‬ I think he will attack soon‭.‬ Then they won't need help anymore‭.‬ ‭-‬If they don't need it‭,‬ we won't even send it‭.‬ Why do you‭, ‬Rjabin‭, ‬look at everything in black‭?‬ ‭- ‬I'm trying to figure out how you can do that‭.‬ We condemn those people there on certain death‭.‬ Don't be afraid‭, ‬Captain‭.‬ You wanted to ask why I'm sending them to certain death‭, ‬right‭?‬ Don't sleep‭, ‬comrades‭.‬ Don't sleep‭.‬ Here's what I think‭. ‬If not us reinforcements arrive‭, ‬comrade politruk‭,‬ will we perhaps endure again‭, ‬or this time we really won't last‭?‬ Help will be here soon‭.‬ They promised us from headquarters‭.‬ Comrades‭, ‬don't sleep‭.‬ Don't sleep‭.‬ Don't let the fighters relax‭,‬ Oganesjan‭.‬ Three days of marching‭, ‬plus one sleepless night‭.‬ People are exhausted‭.‬ ‭-‬I know‭.‬ Just don't fall asleep‭, ‬my dears‭.‬ Help just didn't arrive‭.‬ Vlasjuk‭!‬ Hey‭!‬ Mikola‭!‬ He fell asleep‭.‬ Now is the right time to go‭.‬ Listen‭, ‬junior lieutenant‭ ...‬ ‭- ‬I want everyone to follow the rules‭.‬ What‭?‬ You think I don't know how everyone curses me and spit after all this‭?‬ ‭"‬Bastard‭! ‬How can he‭?‬ There is no conscience‭. "‬ But everyone's conscience is different‭.‬ You asked me about family‭.‬ I have no one‭.‬ I am a former orphan‭.‬ I'm on my own skin felt like people like you‭,‬ conscientious‭, ‬trying to get rid of me as soon as the opportunity presents itself‭.‬ What‭, ‬you grew up and now it's all your fault‭?‬ ‭-‬Not‭.‬ The state took me‭, ‬fed me‭,‬ gave me an education‭,‬ and entrusted me to supervise how its laws are enforced‭.‬ To give punishment to everyone who deserves it‭.‬ And I really don't care what others think of me‭.‬ And donقÄôt you think you might be too much cruelly set up these new laws of yours‭?‬ Break everything over your knees‭.‬ You have all the power‭.‬ Who do you want to punish‭,‬ whom you pardon‭.‬ You knew you couldn't take flyers‭.‬ Why did you take them‭? ‬You broke the law‭.‬ ‭- ‬I'm just as devilish as I'm going to die‭.‬ Just to get my body covered someone else in the ditch‭.‬ The law is the same for everyone‭. -‬Then tell me‭,‬ by what law am I dragging you like this now‭?‬ Do I have to do that too‭?‬ The law‭, ‬the law‭!‬ If it was the law‭, ‬we would all be burning in hell‭.‬ And there‭, ‬there‭ ...‬ Only by the grace of God can we get out of there‭.‬ A‭, ‬Vanjatka‭ ...‬ I already thought I lost you‭.‬ Give it here‭.‬ ‭- ‬Then how are you‭, ‬brothers‭?‬ Everything is fine‭.‬ ‭-‬Sit down‭. ‬Sit down‭.‬ Everything is ready‭.‬ We will welcome the Germans as they should‭.‬ I see you're ready‭.‬ Just don't fall asleep‭, ‬brothers‭.‬ Soloviev‭! -‬Yes‭!‬ ‭- ‬What's up‭, ‬countryman‭? - ‬Don't sleep‭.‬ You got scared‭?‬ You betrayed the old man‭, ‬didn't you‭?‬ Ooo‭!‬ ‭-‬Stop it‭, ‬Karcev‭!‬ At the expense of tee need‭, ‬bastard‭.‬ Just try something similar again‭.‬ And who am I‭?‬ No one‭.‬ You were wrong‭, ‬Constantine‭.‬ That special would definitely find it those leaflets at the old man's‭.‬ Comrade senior lieutenant‭ ...‬ ‭-‬Yes‭!‬ How much longer will we live‭?‬ To tell you the truth‭?‬ I do not know‭.‬ I will surely live until the morning‭.‬ Can I tell you something then‭?‬ In Moscow‭, ‬it used to be in Marina Roshcha lived a hardened thief‭.‬ Kostya Vitalyov‭, ‬called Vitaly‭.‬ Everyone knew about him‭,‬ but there was no way they could catch him‭.‬ So last year in May‭,‬ not far from the cinema‭ "‬Uranus‭"‬ tried to steal a wallet once to a respectable citizen‭.‬ One of my schoolmates and I are they noticed it‭.‬ Olezik tried to stop him‭, ‬but Kostya‭, ‬as usual‭, ‬managed to escape‭.‬ And Oleg was found a week later with a knife stabbed in the body‭.‬ However‭, ‬he miraculously survived‭.‬ What do you think‭, ‬comrade senior lieutenant‭,‬ could your courier be that thief‭ ...‬ for which a federal warrant has been issued‭?‬ It's not that I don't have an order to withdraw‭.‬ Nor that it is practically impossible to keep village without help‭.‬ Than I will lose in vain manpower and technique‭.‬ And so I will weaken the battalion‭.‬ You will ask me what sense it makes for everyone die in Ovsjanjikovo‭?‬ I'll tell you‭.‬ I didn't cut your boyfriend‭.‬ A lot is attributed to us‭.‬ When in October‭ '‬41‭. ‬rumors started in Moscow that the Germans are in town‭,‬ we did a couple of goldsmiths‭.‬ Then the cops got on our necks‭.‬ Everyone ran away‭, ‬and where am I going‭?‬ I fly into the House of Culture‭ "‬Petoletka‭".‬ And there's a bunch of men‭.‬ Volunteers‭.‬ I ran into them‭.‬ He stole some guy's documents‭.‬ I'm looking‭...‬ Her name is the same as mine‭. ‬Kostik‭.‬ I hid the gold that I had‭, ‬and to the front‭.‬ I thought I would manage to escape along the way‭.‬ You don't have to trust me‭, ‬guys‭,‬ I've been fighting for four months now‭.‬ I like that‭, ‬comrade senior lieutenant‭.‬ At the expense of the bastard‭.‬ ‭- ‬Storage‭, ‬Basov‭.‬ At the expense of the bastard and done‭.‬ ‭-‬Storage‭!‬ Comrade senior lieutenant‭,‬ it should be sent to the expense‭!‬ Leave‭, ‬when I say‭!‬ I don't understand where we got that from‭.‬ What that‭?‬ ‭-‬So that‭: "‬At the expense‭ ... ‬At the expense‭ ..."‬ ‭"‬At expense‭."‬ You came up with a good word‭.‬ It's like talking about trees‭.‬ ‭- ‬Stepmother‭, ‬are you deaf‭?‬ It's a criminal‭, ‬a criminal‭.‬ I haven't always been‭, ‬Vanja‭, ‬either an accountant in a collective farm‭.‬ And what were you‭? ‬A‭? -‬Professor of philosophy at Leningrad University‭.‬ Well‭...‬ What's new with you‭?‬ Night of recognition‭.‬ Join us‭, ‬politruk‭.‬ What is your name‭?‬ Alexey‭.‬ Do you know‭, ‬Ljoإ‮!‬a‭ ...‬ how a small child smiles when does mom breastfeed him‭?‬ You take him slowly to the cradle‭.‬ And it just blinks its eyes and trying to say something‭.‬ And he's just looking at you‭.‬ And smile‭.‬ We Russians smile too little‭.‬ And those are the children‭.‬ They look at you‭, ‬fool and animal‭,‬ and laughed‭.‬ Just like that‭.‬ For no reason‭.‬ They don't even know who you are‭.‬ They don't care‭.‬ Did you do a good deed‭,‬ or killed someone‭.‬ That smile‭ ...‬ is like communion‭.‬ Like what‭?‬ As forgiveness of all sins‭, ‬son‭.‬ The Germans‭.‬ Tell us‭, ‬Stepmother‭.‬ What did you answer for in life‭?‬ You fled the revolution to the village‭.‬ And there they kept records of others things and destinies‭.‬ And your life‭, ‬as you said‭,‬ you shit‭.‬ What‭, ‬you're scared of the word‭ "‬expense‭"‬ and hid like a rat‭.‬ I love Russia‭.‬ I set out to defend her as soon as it was was necessary‭.‬ Not Russia‭, ‬but the Soviet Union‭.‬ ‭- ‬Let there be that Alliance‭.‬ Alliance‭ ...‬ How many years has this Alliance of yours existed‭?‬ Russia has not gone anywhere‭.‬ It's been here for 1000‭ ‬years‭, ‬and it will continue to be‭.‬ Why do we behave like this towards each other‭?‬ And I came to defend the homeland‭.‬ Everyone signed up‭, ‬including me‭.‬ And they send us a special officer department and his assistant‭. ‬And the food‭?‬ Nobody even thought to send it to us‭.‬ Although we haven't eaten in days‭.‬ We have to admit that The Germans are waging lordly wars‭.‬ They swallowed the whole thing Europe and they did not drown‭.‬ To start beating them‭,‬ we have to let them know that we can't just retreat‭,‬ him and to fight to the death if need be‭.‬ And you don't wonder where they are residents of this village‭?‬ They are gone‭.‬ They were killed far from the fighting‭.‬ Why the enemy treats us better than ourselves‭?‬ They were taken away with the threat of weapons to work for the Germans‭. -‬Stop‭!‬ Bass‭!‬ Come here‭.‬ And you‭, ‬Kostik‭, ‬pity him in vain‭.‬ ‭- ‬Vanya‭, ‬cut it out‭!‬ Bass‭!‬ I said‭...‬ I told you Vanja to stop‭.‬ ‭-‬Sorry‭.‬ I should have told you earlier‭.‬ Thats is it how is it‭.‬ ‭- ‬What do you want from me‭?‬ Come on‭, ‬I'll show you what they are did to our people‭.‬ Get up‭!‬ Come on‭.‬ Shit‭!‬ And lastly‭, ‬Captain‭.‬ Don't you really realize that if us The Germans win‭, ‬no one will stay alive‭.‬ There are about 200‭ ‬people here‭.‬ The whole village‭.‬ Oh my God‭...‬ Oh my God‭...‬ Oh my God‭...‬ Rest‭, ‬Lord‭, ‬souls of the dead‭ ...‬ Oh my God‭...‬ Oh my God‭...‬ God‭, ‬how many children are here‭ ...‬ Oh my God‭...‬ So‭ ...‬ What do we have here‭?‬ Forward‭.‬ Germans‭! ‬Germans‭!‬ ‭-‬Fire

trenches‭.‬ It's over‭.‬ Looks like we're done behind the line of fritters‭.‬ They almost didn't shoot at us‭.‬ Obviously they are not sure either who is where‭.‬ Go‭, ‬soldier‭. ‬Go while you're still alive‭.‬ What‭?‬ What are you talking about‭, ‬I'm under arrest‭.‬ ‭-‬Go away‭!‬ You atoned for your mistake‭.‬ I'll keep them‭.‬ The two of us had a great time‭.‬ And you fool didn't understand anything‭.‬ Get up‭!‬ Get up‭!‬ Come on‭!‬ Come on‭.‬ Guys‭, ‬guys‭!‬ I'm here‭!‬ Mikola‭! -‬Ah‭?‬ ‭-‬Help‭. - ‬Comrade Lieutenant‭ ...‬ Where's your ammunition‭?‬ ‭- ‬Spread out in the trenches‭.‬ Save the bombs and take over circular defense‭.‬ Submachine guns at the ends‭!‬ Bass‭. ‬Vanja‭ ...‬ Go through the ditch‭.‬ Look how many of us survived‭.‬ Send platoon commanders to me‭.‬ Come on‭!‬ Commander‭!‬ Don't forget about me‭.‬ I set the huts on fire‭.‬ That's not how we guys can go unnoticed‭.‬ I thought you were killed‭.‬ You won't wait for that‭, ‬Vanjatka‭.‬ Gavrjushkin‭, ‬Fokin‭!‬ Follow me‭!‬ Where is Machikhin‭? ‬Where is Somov‭?‬ ‭- ‬The philosopher is alive‭.‬ And I haven't seen a pioneer‭.‬ Spread out‭!‬ So‭ ...‬ What about machine guns‭?‬ Mr‭. ‬Officer‭, ‬are you ordering that are we going to attack‭?‬ Not‭.‬ Every part to those Russians‭.‬ We lost too many people‭.‬ There is nothing left of that village anyway‭.‬ Save the mortars and bury their trenches mine‭.‬ Execute the order‭.‬ Let me know when you're ready to fire‭.‬ ‭-‬I understand‭!‬ Stop‭!‬ Get up‭!‬ Yup‭!‬ Get up‭!‬ Don't shoot‭! ‬Don't shoot‭!‬ I have a pass‭!‬ Don't shoot‭! ‬Don't shoot‭!‬ I have

Eventually we will learn them though to kill each other‭.‬ Follow me‭!‬ Why hide your sin‭? ‬They broke us‭.‬ Everything went wrong‭.‬ And in my opinion‭,‬ the fascist plan failed‭.‬ Because Rikov fired up them with a machine gun‭,‬ and woke us with his cry‭.‬ ‭-‬Yes‭.‬ Why Rikov‭?‬ Maybe it was old‭.‬ ‭-‬Difficult‭.‬ If it weren't for that machine gun‭, ‬they would have cut it would us like cabbage‭, ‬comrade senior lieutenant‭.‬ Let the devil carry them and the cabbage‭.‬ What‭?‬ ‭- ‬Someone's coming‭.‬ A‭?‬ Look‭, ‬isn't that your countryman‭?‬ Come on‭, ‬come on‭, ‬come on‭ ...‬ ‭-‬Slowly‭.‬ Comrade senior lieutenant‭ ...‬ Let me speak‭.‬ The Germans are not planning an attack‭.‬ They decided to bury our trenches mines from mortars‭.‬ Repeat‭.‬ The signal to shell is a red rocket‭.‬ The battle fell silent‭.‬ We're late‭.‬ The battle did not end‭.‬ Only the attack stopped‭.‬ The real thing will only begin now‭.‬ Who are you listening to‭?‬ This eagle is halfway there hours admired the Germans‭.‬ I swear‭. ‬I heard when he was a German officer ordered the trenches to be razed to the ground‭.‬ I speak german‭.‬ If it is like that‭,‬ it will soon overwhelm us mines from mortars‭.‬ In half an hour‭, ‬if any of us survive‭,‬ he will no longer be able to fight‭.‬ So‭ ...‬ If we don't back down‭,‬ the freaks will break us without losing of one man‭.‬ The battalion commander ordered to occupy and defend Ovsjanjikovo‭.‬ If we withdraw‭, ‬we will turn a deaf ear order‭. - ‬Vanya‭, ‬how many of us are left‭?‬ 32‭.‬ We must not retreat‭, ‬Commander‭.‬ ‭- ‬That's right‭, ‬we can't‭.‬ But I am yours lives‭, ‬as well as their own‭,‬ ready to give only in a substitute for the lives of the freaks‭.‬ But to sacrifice my company in order to they made minced meat out of it‭,‬ I will not allow that‭.‬ Therefore‭, ‬the final decision will be mine‭.‬ Politruk Zorin‭!‬ ‭-‬Yes‭.‬ Sergeant Lavrov‭!‬ ‭-‬Yes‭.‬ Lead the rest of the company according to our lines‭.‬ Yes‭, ‬Basov‭, ‬Karcev‭ ...‬ We stay here to protect your withdrawal‭.‬ And let's see if Somov lied to us‭.‬ Let me stay too‭.‬ I would stay too‭, ‬Commander‭.‬ ‭-‬And I‭.‬ Me‭, ‬Basov and Karcev‭!‬ I order the others to withdraw‭.‬ Mr‭. ‬Officer‭, ‬they are mortars ready for action‭.‬ Okay‭.‬ Hurry up‭, ‬Jefim Borisovic‭.‬ I wish you all the best of luck‭,‬ comrade senior lieutenant‭.‬ Comrade senior lieutenant‭.‬ Look what this luftica has‭.‬ A‭?‬ He's good‭,‬ It really smells‭.‬ Mm‭?‬ It smokes nicely‭.‬ ‭-‬Cigarettes‭ ...‬ Commander‭.‬ ‭-‬Mm‭?‬ It's your turn‭.‬ First‭...‬ Thank you for staying with me‭, ‬brothers‭.‬ And secondly‭ ...‬ If Somov didn't lie‭,‬ this is our last battle‭.‬ No preference‭...‬ To win‭!‬ If I was lucky‭, ‬I would be in Sochi now‭.‬ For luck‭.‬ And to win‭.‬ And I don't regret anything‭.‬ I would love to hug my mother one more time‭.‬ I promised her I would be back‭.‬ Otherwise he will be angry‭.‬ To win‭.‬ He was a real kid‭.‬ Fire away‭!‬ Their mother‭ ...‬ Come on‭, ‬come on‭, ‬Semyonov‭. ‬Faster‭!‬ ‭- ‬Don't stop‭, ‬debts‭!‬ Don't stop‭!‬ Is that what we talked about‭?‬ Vanja‭!‬ I'm out of ammunition‭!‬ ‭-‬Ah‭?‬ Ammunition‭!‬ ‭- ‬I don't have any more‭!‬ Basov was killed‭!‬ I saw‭.‬ They will be coming at us again soon‭!‬ Ours have probably already arrived‭.‬ Shall we try too‭?‬ Let's try‭.‬ Come on‭!‬ You don't think I know what's going on in Ovsjanjikovo‭?‬ Comrade Lieutenant Colonel‭,‬ let me address‭. -‬Mm‭?‬ The company commander from Ovsjanjikovo is outside‭.‬ Calm down‭!‬ Comrade Lieutenant Colonel‭ ...‬ Tell me why you surrendered the village not carrying out my order‭?‬ I didn't turn him in‭.‬ They drove us out with mines‭.‬ And now listen to me carefully‭.‬ I'm giving you‭ ...‬ and your company‭ ...‬ last chance‭ ...‬ to redeem yourself with blood‭.‬ I order you to floor urgently expel the Germans and regain control over the village of Ovsjanjikovo‭.‬ Regain control of the village‭!‬ Understood‭?‬ It is now impossible to occupy the village‭.‬ People are exhausted to the limit‭!‬ You send them to certain senseless death‭.‬ Commander‭, ‬come with me‭.‬ Take a look at‭...‬ It's been getting ready for days‭, ‬from here the final great offensive‭.‬ We are entrusted with the task of giving all our strength we attract the opponent to ourselves It is as if the main blow will start from here‭.‬ The Germans must believe that the main one will blow to be right here‭.‬ That's why you're going‭,‬ and you will occupy Ovsjanjikovo‭.‬ You saved humanity‭.‬ Well done‭!‬ You have an advantage‭.‬ You were there‭. ‬You know every house‭.‬ And the most important thing‭. ‬Germans in general they don't expect you to come back‭.‬ That you can come back‭.‬ And you can do it‭.‬ The surprise factor is important‭.‬ But people are barely alive to me‭.‬ I also need 45s‭.‬ I'll fill your chat‭.‬ Take the 45s too‭.‬ But the village‭ ...‬ must be returned regardless of the price‭.‬ Is that clear‭?‬ I understand‭!‬ Let me walk away‭.‬ Go‭, ‬son‭.‬ ‭According to official data‭, ‬in battles near Rإ‮>‬evo 1942-1943‭. ‬years‭‬ ‭over a million died Soviet soldiers and officers‭.‬ ‭Rzhevska is considered to be a battle reversed the course of the war‭.‬ ‭The battle for Rzhev was very important strategic importance‭‬ ‭for the final breakdown fascist near Stalingrad‭.‬ ‭At the end of May 1943‭, ‬they were Germans stopped in the area near Rإ‮>‬evo‭,‬ ‭and the Red Army moved the front to 150-160‭ ‬kilometers from Moscow‭.‬ ‭The German army did not get that way‭‬ ‭expected gain for the battle of Stalingrad‭.‬
