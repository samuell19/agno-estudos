Lesbian Rape: Sweet Honey Juice aka 'Silencer Made of Glass' A Shishi Production Screenplay by Shirou Yumeno Editor: Masatsugi Sakai Toshihiro Seino April 1st... Clear weather. I have nothing to record. Cast: Rei Takagi Emi Sugimoto Kawaaya Mitsushima, Emi Ishikawa Susumu Maemura Kouichi Imaizumi Tomorrow is my birthday. Hey, honey, are you listening? Directed by Hisayasu Sato Ema Laboratory Honey, I'll report the results. If you add fluids A and B together, it doesn't result in an AB fluid. It creates a C fluid. Or we could call it 'fluid X'. An unknown substance is produced. That's common sense. Are you someone from Ema Laboratory? Yes. We provide the laboratory with test tubes and the like. I'm Yumisaka of Biimu. Nice to meet you. Please excuse me... I've just started working with Dr. Ema today. I'm Chitsuko Matsuda. The pleasure is all mine. Oh, so you're the doctor's favorite assistant. I've heard a lot about you - that you're beautiful and brilliant. I have an appointment but is the doctor here? Please wait. Show me! Honey... Today I saw Chitsuko Matsuda. I'm rather fond of her. She smells wonderful. Like a lizard. It's the smell of a lizard. How pretty! I'm sorry. Yumisaka told me to hand it to you for sure by the next day. When I asked what it was for... ...he said it's because he's much obliged to you. Even if it were a diamond, it's just a stone if it's late. I'm sorry. I'm on my period, so I get irritated easily. Let's go to the medical office and get your hand looked at. It's okay. I can do it by myself. I'm really sorry about this. Yes, it's Ako. I'm not home. Izumi is on a date right now. If you have business... Everyone's really busy. We're called 'The Self Resort Club'. I'm calling to invite you to join a members'only club. I'm having sex right now. Call back after the ejaculation. Did you like it? It wasn't specially made, but it was high quality glass. Thanks. It'll get dirty if I use it in the lab, so I have it on display at home. It's a test tube, so please use it a lot. If it gets dirty, I'll bring you another one. Then, every day would be my birthday. Will you listen to me talk about a dream I had? If it's interesting... I don't know whether or not a woman would find it interesting. If I don't have a listen first, I won't know. One day, I'm making a custom handgun with a transparent silencer. What's a silencer? It's a piece of equipment that lessens the noise made by a gun. Oh! I've seen that in a movie before. That's the kind of thing a killer would have, eh? That's not necessarily the case. That's what it's for, right? So then? I use the gun to go around committing rapes. The story about using a gun to rape was interesting... ...but it's impossible to pull off in reality. However... Matsuda! I have concert tickets. Wanna go? When is it? Today. I'm a little busy today... Sinopoli's conducting Mahler's 5th Symphony. Don't you think it's worth listening to? Is it inconvenient for you? My mother's coming from the country. - Where from? - Tosa. Well then, I can't say anything unreasonable. I'm sorry. Invite someone else. We were talking about throwing a welcome party for you but... ...let me know ahead of time when it will be convenient for you. Honey... I misjudged the dream about Mahler. Hello? Who is this? But I drank too much. I didn't think you would go out with me. Then why did you call me? I thought you might have been home. I wonder if it would have been best if I hadn't been home. That's not it, but... Hey. Didn't you have something to talk about? Well, just a little... It's about Kyoko, isn't it? Nah... Yumisaka, aren't you just together? Or are you really in love? You gave her a birthday present. No, that was because she's always helping me out in the lab. She's a serious person, who's never been romantically involved. She invited me to go to go a concert with her, but I refused. I wasn't in the mood for classical music. Plus, she's a little cold and hard to get close to. To me, you seem the same way. Even though I'm light heartedly hanging out with you like this? What's wrong? I got a feeling like we were being followed by someone. Excuse me. Would you like to go drink some tea with me? Do you like it up here? I like looking at the view from the roof top. I don't like it. Are you afraid of heights? That's not it, but... When I look down from a place like this... I always wonder what it would be like to jump off. You would die, wouldn't you? Yeah. Are you always contemplating suicide? I don't know, but I feel funny when I look down from places like this. I feel like I've seen a vision, like when I was inside my mother's womb. I was floating in the city. I know it's not possible, but it feels that way. A dream, right? No, it's different. I feel it. You don't feel anything from dreams. That's not true. That's why I think I really want a child. A child? If I become a mother, I'll understand the feelings of a child, right? Children ought to be conceived inside of test tubes. If you get married, your feelings will change. Married? After seeing the doctor and the students, don't you think men are good for nothings? They can't solve anything. They just think everything will be finished when they ejaculate. If I was stuck with one of them, I'd go insane! It's not right to say that. There are capable men and good for nothing women too. Stupid! That much is obvious. I'm talking about the issue of preference. Considering you're the doctor's favorite assistant, you're pretty dull. Do you like the doctor? I had a dream about you. You were screaming, "Help me!" Please don't have any dreams about me. What does this mean? Honey... You know, when I hit that girl? I felt ecstasy through my hand. Rape? Are you serious? It's not something I would say as a joke, is it? I don't think you could use a silencer, like you were talking about before, though. If that's the way you feel, I can do it. Eh? Who's the target? Chitsuko Matsuda. Show me your silencer. Noooo! Hello? It's Tsutsumiya. Yes? I watched. Huh? But that wasn't even really a rape. What are you talking about? Attack the 'lower mouth'. It's unlike you to talk like that. I thought I told you to rape Chitsuko. It's not something I can just do right away, after being told to do it. I don't have any confidence, so I was getting some practice... on the woman who always demands rebates when I do deliveries. So you're saying you were able to do it because you held a grudge? You need to stop shadowing me. Fine, when are you gonna do it? Do you think I'm your plaything? Calling me to this place... Not at all. There's no other place to do this sort of thing, right? If you don't at least do this, Chitsuko will figure out who you are. Not really. It's just that this is your taste, right? Mine? Never mind. Did you know there were murders in this area recently? Nope. I haven't heard anything like that. Are you sure you weren't just dreaming? Dreaming? Lately, I've figured it out. For you, dreams are reality. And so... And so? Dreams are the true reality. Very interesting. Not only do you do rape, you do psychological analysis too! Put this on your silencer and thrust it into Chitsuko. It's my blood. But that's as far as you take it. Please do it. Hey, do you think you would you ever donate sperm? Eh? Why? I can't say. No, I couldn't sell life. You call that snot like stuff life? Matsuda! Matsuda! Are you okay? Hang in there. Matsuda! It's okay. Where am I? My room. I was working late and I went on the roof and then there was this woman... And then I... It's okay now. You should lie down. I wonder why she was in a place like that... A lot of people go in and out, so you should be careful. I wonder if she was after me? No way... Stay over tonight. That would be for the best. Here. You said you wanted a child, didn't you? But you're not planning to get married, are you? Wanna raise a child together? An adopted child? Children can be made in test tubes. You're like me. I'm going home. Did it go smoothly after that? What? I've been thinking about you for a long time. I was wondering why you'd tell me to rape her, but then stop me in the middle. Did you figure something out? I just pretended to run at first. I followed the two of you after that. You like that girl, don't you? Indeed. Anyhow, stop using me as a love toy! Honey... Kill him! No! Let me go! No! Stop it! Nooo!! No! No! No! No! Stop! No! No! No! Please stop! No! Let me go! Please! You've turned into a real rapist, huh? Stop following me around. It's something I thought of. I have a request... What did you do? I drugged the juice, just enough so that you wouldn't fall asleep. What do you think you're doing? I'm just getting some. Why? As you said, I'm a lesbian. I have no interest in men. So it would be hard for me to have sex with you. But Chitsuko wants a child... You serious? Your wish will be granted, right? I figured you liked me when we were in the bath. You were acting as the man and treating me as the woman, right? That's probably it. If you understand, then isn't that good? Accept my feelings too. What you're after is purely pleasure. Having a child is about love. Even I have a right to love. Then will you be obedient to me? Take off your underwear and get on all fours on the bed. Hurry up and do it. Lower your hips more. Raise your butt. Won't you do it like I said? Hey, that's the only way to make Chitsuko nicer. Even if she gets pregnant, she won't necessarily get nicer. I don't agree at all. What the hell kind of a woman would give birth to a child conceived through rape? Then try raping me. You really want to fuck me, don't you? I'm the one you love. I know that. But I don't have any desire for men. Nor love, either? I don't know. Which is it that you feel for Chitsuko Matsuda? What I feel for Chitsuko is... Who are you? There's been another gun rape incident. This is a sketch of the object being used. The authorities are racking their brains. Now we have a report from the scene of the crime... It's due soon. It's my child! I won't let you give birth to it. I don't need you anymore. The End
