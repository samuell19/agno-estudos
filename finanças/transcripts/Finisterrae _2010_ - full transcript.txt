Follow me. Pay attention. Watch. It's a goat, It's being born. It's looking for its mother. And now? A birthday. They're celebrating the passing of time. And where are we now? It's a hospital. Come with me. Look. It's the end. I want to become a living being. I'm overcome with nausea. I'm tired of being a ghost. What about you? That's fair enough. But I don't know why. And how do we become living beings? We must find the door. We must consult the oracle of Garrel. Oracle of Garrel. The oracle told them that to start a new ephemeral earthly life, they have to walk the Santiago way until Fisterra. We'll leave tomorrow. We have to follow the wind. It's the only way I'm tired. Let's spend the night next to the river. Are you still going to the psychiatrist? And I'm still on medication I don't believe in doctors. The most important thing is food and sport. What do you want from me? Which is the way to Santiago? We've been lost for two days. That way! There are two paths. That way. There are two paths. Here and there. Hippie. Run. Do you remember how many lefts, and how many rights they were? Yes. Where have you been? I needed to... watch the sky. What's that? I don't want to worry you but it's been following us for a few days. But what is it? Something from the underworld? - A, B, C. - It's twenty past one. - D, E, F, G. - Twenty to four. - H, I, J, K. - Twenty five past eight. - L, M, N. - Twenty past five. - Half past twelve on the dot. - O, P, Q. - Twenty past four. - R, S.

What time does it start? Sorry Rachel, have you got the time? Rosa, Rosa, come here, come I've made cod balls. But. What's this? They had sung, I will have sung, you will have sung I feel terrible. What's the matter? I don't feel well I can still hear voices inside my head I need to sleep I know a cave near here. You'll be fine. Deer. What do you want? Will you let me listen to the stone? I can't see any stone. At least see it. Go back to your folks. Did you sleep well? I had nightmares. And you? Did you leave the cave last night? No I didn't I must have dreamt it. We're late. We've a long way to go until Fisterra. Let's go. No I've made friends I want to stay here for a couple of days. Forget about friends lf you come now, I'll do the little stick thing. Wait. Over there. Much better! Come on, let's go. Have you thought about what you'll turn into? No I want to turn into a reindeer that way I can be with my friends. Don't turn around. It's behind us. Who? The creature from the underworld. So what shall we do? Ignore it. Don't stop I've seen an eagle owl! An eagle owl? Yes, run Let's ask it. Hello, eagle owl. We're being followed by something from the underworld that's making it difficult for us to continue. Tell us what we can do. The eagle owl told them that they must emphasise the cracks and try and close the past with the help of fire and water. Thank you, eagle owl. Look at this. Do you think it'll stop following us? Charms hardly ever work. I want to go fishing tomorrow. Ok. I'll take the opportunity to go and see my friends. But you don't have any friends. Yes I have, the deer. The deer. You'll be all right here. Relax. Ghost. Creature from the underworld? Your brother killed my mother. The hippie? Yes. Look. Pleasure. I don't owe you anything any more. We went to play, not to die. Were there any fish in the river? Fourteen dwarves came. They stole all my fish and threw themselves into the river. You can see a video! What did you see? A piece of Catalan video art from the late eighties lt was very funny! But their clothes were terrible. By the way. Did they have 220V in the eighties? They even had 380V Santiago de Compostela. Is it closing? Don't worry. It's the softness of the cement. Turn it on. We're going to do something important. Last Stage, Fisterra. And now what? We have to find the place. What am I looking for? Look for a beach. There? Feel it. It's the beauty of the complex. It's the threshold. Look. The door. Let's go. No. Not now. And the ghost turned into a frog. The end.
