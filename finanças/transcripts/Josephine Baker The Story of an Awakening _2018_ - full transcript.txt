(♫ BAND PLAYS ♫) (♫♫) (♫ DRUMMING ♫) (♫ BAND PLAYS ♫) Parisians had never seen anything like it. It wasn't ballet or burlesque, it wasn't a tribal dance. It was the spirit of an era. It was about laughter, desire, freedom. In front of white audiences, Josephine played out her life. (♫ MUSIC CONTINUES AND FADES ♫) Because below the surface, emotions welled inside her. Memories of her childhood, the stinging pain of segregation. The plight of her people across the ocean. (APPLAUSE AND CHEERS) Josephine would have to wait 40 years before she could cast off this burden. I have a dream today! (CHEERING) Josephine Baker! Gone were the feathers, the sequins and glitter. It was in a fighters uniform that she celebrated this great moment of victory. I want you to know… …that this is the happiest day of my entire life. (CHEERING) She turned her fame into a weapon to fight injustice. This is the story of the first black star in history. (♫ SWING BAND PLAYS ♫) Dancing to survive, dancing to escape the harsh Missouri winter. These steps passed down since the days of slavery would stay with Josephine throughout her life. Josephine was seven when her mother sent her work for white families, a succession of mistresses who never treated her like a human being. Josephine gritted her teeth and hung on. Until that day she would never forget. VOICE OF JOSEPHINE: I let the dish water boil too long and the plates got broken. Mistress was so angry, that she pushed my hands into the boiling water. I screamed. I prayed to God, "Please let me die. I'm too miserable." Running away to survive, Josephine left St Louis at the age of 13 to join an all-black travelling vaudeville troupe. Her mother said, "If that's the life she's chosen, let her live it." Josephine Baker growing up in St Louis, Missouri was tough. It was not an easy place to be. Although coming out of the Civil War, St Louis was on the right side, it was a Union city, it was a very tough and very segregated pace. And black folks were kind of pushed in certain parts of the city, it was very poor, the opportunities were not great. There was of course a burgeoning black middle class, but Baker did not belong to that. And she endured a lot of tragedies, abuses, she married young, twice. And so, she was willing to take risks that others would not. Josephine aimed for the sky. And her journey took her to New York. The capital of music halls was slowly opening up to black America. The more adventurous white folk went slumming to black cabarets in Harlem. Josephine knew that this was the audience she had to win over. But wanting to please this new clientele, black producers only cast light-skinned chorus girls. "Too short, too skinny, too dark." Josephine didn't fit the bill. But she went ahead and got herself hired as a dresser. A few weeks later, she was on stage. To attract attention, Josephine played the clown from St Louis. She crossed her eyes, grimaced, flung her limbs about. Audiences roared with laughter. They came back every night, just to see her. JOSEPHINE: One night, a white woman was waiting to see me after the show. She was a producer recruiting for an all-black show in Paris, and she wanted to sign me up. (FOGHORN BLARES) Josephine knew that this was her big break. So, off she sailed. The day we left, I didn't see a thing. I stayed in my cabin the whole day. I was so afraid. Afraid of the ocean, afraid of Europe, afraid on the unknown. Sidney Bechet whispered to me, "Don't be scared. "You'll see. People in Paris don't care about our colour." And he was right. I was amazed to be treated as an equal by whites, and to be able to mingle with them. Everywhere, we were greeted with a smile. Now, that's what freedom is. Josephine instantly fell in love with Paris. Its narrow streets, cafe terraces, the constant clamour of honking horns. Lovers kissing in the street. Yet her dreams of Paris were already starting to slip away. The show's promoters were in a panic. La Revue Negre was too American, too prudish, when they had promised audiences African savagery. They had three days to come up with an idea to save the show. Everyone's eyes turned to Josephine. Of all the dancers, she was the funniest, the sexiest. And she certainly wasn't shy. She had to be the star. For one of the acts, she would dance bare-breasted. That was something Paris audiences would not forget. Critics, artists, high society. Everyone was there. For Josephine, it was a moment of truth. If she won them over, fame could be hers. The lights went down. The show was one. (♫ TRAD JAZZ PLAYS ♫) JOSEPHINE: Blinded by the blazing stage lights, possessed by some kind of devil, I improvised. I was spellbound by the music, driven wild by the theatre packed to the doors. Even my teeth and eyes burned with fever. With every leap, I seemed to touch the sky. And when I returned to earth, it felt like it was mine alone. Alternating between the clown and the seductress, the primitive and the American… …Josephine hit Paris like a bombshell. She broke new ground, embodying the audience's fantasies, taking them to new heights. (APPLAUSE) It was a smash hit. Two camps quickly formed. The old guard saw Josephine as poison, a symbol of decadence. For the modernists, she was the heroine of the much-needed artistic revival of Europe. (FIREWORKS EXPLODE) I collected press clippings. They were my first French lessons. "She brings the breath of the jungle, a primal strength and beauty "to the tired stages of Western civilisation." Better still, "She is the black Venus who haunted Baudelaire." But also on a more cruel note, "La Revue Negre is nothing more than "lamentable transatlantic exhibitionism that takes us back "to the ape in less time than we descended from it." In conservative circles, the success of La Revue Negre was alarming. This black American modernity was subversive, and French people would do better to visit the highly popular Colonial Exhibition. There at least, everyone was in their rightful place. Black Africans were in replica villages, while white men paraded through their conquered territory. The French Empire was here to stay. To reinforce the demonstration, almost naked young African men have to dive into a pond, to retrieve coins. Josephine was well aware that she also personified the savage. But she had her own way of interpreting this troubling role. She drew on her spectators' fantasies, appropriated them, remodelled them. Wearing a string of bananas around her waist, she turned the ultimate racist symbol into a phallic trophy that she gyrated before thrilled spectators. Artists and writers adored this dancer, who shocked conformists with such charm and wit. Simenon became her secretary and her lover. Poiret dressed her, Hemingway frequented her new show, Colette wrote letters to her, Calder sculpted her body, Van Dongen painted her, and Picasso called her "the Nefertiti of today." African art was extremely popular during that time, and the Surrealists were very appreciative of African art. For them, it was just the embodiment of art that was not impacted by Western influences. Blacks oftentimes represented that in its purest way, and Baker was right in the centre of it, and Josephine in her posing - deliberately posing in certain ways - also understood what she was embodying. She was a very clever woman in that sense. ♪ I don't know why ♪ ♪ I made you cry… ♪ Josephine adored the image artists had of her. She revelled in playing the African statue that all of a sudden, breaks into dance. ♪ ..I'll try to forgive and forget… ♪ Sophisticated and impulsive, her temperament fit perfectly with the Roaring '20s, a giddy time when living to excess became vital. Anything to forget loved ones who didn't come back from the War. Dancing, going naked, running wild. Imitating these savages who never had the strange idea of inventing a world war. (APPLAUSE AND CHEERS) JOSEPHINE: I was at a new hotel in the Rue des Batignolles, a charming white building. The chambermaid was white, the porter who delivered my breakfast, also white. They took care of my every need as I lounged on my white pillows, after all those years of working as a maid for whites. It was absolutely an overwhelming experience for her. France becomes a citadel, a refuge for African-Americans, and she's like, "Come, the water's warm here. "Leave that cold water over there, and come here where you will be "welcomed, you don't have to deal with these sorts of things." And so, it allows the French to have a certain idea, a puffed up sense of themselves with respect to race relations. That's mythic, but in Baker's mind, certainly in Baker's world and what she represented, it was very much true. (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) Her success was phenomenal. Josephine needed support, an ally. She met Pepito, an Italian adventurer who styled himself as Count Abatino. He was an inspired businessman and had an eye for opportunity. He became her manager and her lover. (DOVES FLAPPING) Pepito thought it was time for Josephine to target the female market. French women were looking for a model to aspire to in their struggle to break free of the past. Black, glamorous and defiant, Josephine projected an image of emancipation. He launched a line of beauty products, Bakerfix hair gel and Bakerskin darkening lotion. They were a hit. In Paris and beyond, fashionistas at the time went wild over anything with Josephine Baker's name on it. Even children had their own Josephine dolls. Josephine was unstoppable. She became a singer, performed at the opera, danced classical ballet and launched a career as an actress. That was Modernist freedom. You know, the woman, you know… …taking the city, taking to the street. Being in nightclubs, dancing naughtily and boldly, bursting into song! And then, she learned the nakedness was wonderful but she also became a fashion icon. And that, would change her hair-dos and they'd walk down the street with a leopard. All of these are signs of daring. The theatrics of free modernity. All of Europe wanted Josephine. She set out on a tour. For almost two years, she travelled from Germany to Romania, Sweden to Italy. Everywhere, crowds flocked to see this black dancer who defied the norms of old Europe. She received thousands of love letters and hundreds of marriage proposals. The infatuation was almost overwhelming. (CHEERING) JOSEPHINE: For the first time, I was scared by the crowds. Their curiosity, their affection, their enthusiasm. White folks' imagination sure is something when it comes to blacks. While some people smothered her with love, others didn't hide their contempt. In Vienna, church bells rang out to warn churchgoers to stay off the streets to avoid catching sight of this shameless black woman. Pamphlets circulated with the headline, "Let That Immoral Woman Be Punished As She Deserves." (♫ TRAD JAZZ PLAYS ♫) I had become a symbol of moral decadence, a threat to the people of Austria. If only they knew that this little negress prays every night, no matter how tired she is after the show. (LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE) I began to feel uneasy about being a curiosity, even if it was written in my contract to amuse people. It had to be at times, terrifying. Because she was always a spectacle. And she was also always under a kind of surveillance. Almost a kind of visual and cultural policing. "What's she going to do now? Is this winning "or is this in some way, maybe a little presumptuous, "a little degrading? Is this art? "Is she advancing art and the art of the race? "Or is she just playing, trivially?" She didn't want us to be thinking about the drama of what it meant to be the first international black star. I think she wanted us to see it as a divine comedy. Comedy to hide dramas, disappointments. Not one of the white men she had loved since coming to France had ever spoken of marriage. Josephine's love life mirrored the role she played in movies. It was fine to fool around with her, but marriage was out of the question. She responded in typical style. In song, with a big smile. (HORN BLOWS) Life in Europe wasn't perfect, but this was where Josephine created her destiny. Where she became a leading figure in the entertainment industry. Where she discovered the power of being a star. But after 11 years away, she had one desire. To settle the scores. To show Americans La Baker. JOSEPHINE: When the ocean liner pulled into the docks, I saw black folk waiting on the wharf. Had they come to see me? We disembarked. All the black folk crowded the gangway. I realised then that they were porters, chauffeurs, maids, waiting for their employers. I wanted to laugh at myself. At the hotel, things got worse. "A suite for Miss Baker?" The receptionist eyed me suspiciously. "There must be a mistake." My manager protested, but they just repeated, "Miss, there must be a mistake." That was it. Nothing could be done. In the eyes of the receptionist, I was just a negress. From one hotel to the next, the same frosty smile, the same shrug of the shoulders, the same outright refusal. Appalling. The demons of my childhood came back to me. I remembered the time my terrified mother woke us in the middle of the night. Outside, we heard screams coming closer. My brother thought it was a storm, but no, it was the whites. The words of our pastor echoed in my head. In a spine-chilling voice, he preached about the apocalypse. We saw huge flames leaping up from the river bank. People were running in every direction. It was as if the entire black community was fleeing, driven away like ants from an anthill. Someone shouted, "A white woman was raped!" I didn't understand the words, but I knew it was a catastrophe. Like the apocalypse. Josephine hoped that the success she achieved in Europe would protect her from racism. Far from it. After her opening on Broadway, scathing reviews consistently pointed to the colour of her skin. She thought she was coming back as a star of a major Broadway show, Ziegfeld Follies, and she assumed that she would triumph, with critics as well as with audiences. And when the show opened, the reviews were patronising to contemptuous. Basically, the tone was, "We're trying to be tolerant about it, "but who is this little negress? You know, who left some time ago "as a tiny little player in the theatre, "and then mysteriously achieved all this fame in Paris." And it appeared that American culture had to belittle and mock and even degrade her for what they decided to see as pretensions, not accomplishment. Bitter, humiliated, Josephine returned to Paris. (CHEERING) At the train station, Josephine kept up the act. She was pleased to be back in Paris, but her heart was heavy. Pepito had died suddenly while she was away. He had been by her side for 10 years. Her partner, her manager, her faithful friend. Without him, she would have to reinvent her life. "Darling," Colette said to me, "don't be forlorn." The French language has such sweet words, like the word "forlorn". So, I went to galas and cocktails. I was a patron here, cheer-woman there. That's when I met Jean Lion, a businessman. He was young and rich, women adored him. But he only had eyes for me. It was flattering. We got married. I became Madame Jean Lion. I had a French passport and I was expecting a baby. I no longer felt forlorn. Josephine had finally found her Prince Charming. At first, she loved the role of Madame Jean Lion, but she soon tired of it. She was a free woman, not a homebody. When she miscarried, she knew it wasn't the life for her. She divorced and returned to the stage. (CHEERING) But it was no longer enough. Josephine wanted to give her life a deeper meaning. She found it in the French Resistance fighting the Nazis. I asked for only one thing. To serve the country to which I am eternally grateful. France made me what I am, accepting me unconditionally. I was ready to give her my life. That war represents such a turn. And probably, the trip to America a few years before, where she had been attacked in so many political ways and had been addressed by many of the black leaders she met. She'd been asked, "What are you going to do about civil rights? "Are you?" She'd been challenged in a way that said, "Are you just a shallow, superficial self-absorbed entertainer "or is there more to you? "You owe a debt." In terms of her visit to America, that was put in largely racial terms but of course, civil rights linked up with anti-fascism, etc. When she went back to France, she had to start thinking about her role there, too. The war enabled Josephine to take a new step, to share in a common battle. She became a spy for the Free French Forces. She risked her life on many occasions. While on tour in hostile territories, she used her sheet music to conceal plans of German military installations written in invisible ink. It can help to be Josephine Baker. The customs officers asked for my papers. But all they wanted was autographs. I was able to pass on the plans without a hitch. (♫ SINGS ♫) Her popularity served as a cover. She always travelled with her so-called assistant, Jacques Abtey. And intelligence agent for the resistance. (♫ SINGS IN FRENCH ♫) Her undercover missions brought her out of herself. Behind the star was a fearless fighter. When American soldiers landed in Morocco in November 1942, Josephine was already there, working for the resistance. A symbol of the Franco-American alliance, she sang to the troops to boost their morale. (APPLAUSE) (♫ PIANO PLAYS ♫) From Morocco to Syria, Josephine performed for black and white Americans, Arabs and Europeans. She dreamed of a better, united world after the defeat of the Nazis. Bravo, seigneur! (APPLAUSE) Josephine was, in a way, she was turning her international audience from La Baker days into a kind of audience but a community, if you will. It was one of her early experiences, I think, with thinking about very diverse people as… As peoples she could bring into, she could by the power of her talent, her will, her vision, bring into a kind of community. (CHEERING) Josephine returned from the war in the spotlight, hailed as a heroine of France for her participation in The Resistance. Soon after marrying the orchestra conductor Jo Bouillon, she accepted an invitation to sing in the United States. She felt sure that after conquering the Nazis, her homeland would at last be able to confront its racist demons. But when she arrived in New York, she saw that nothing had changed. Just like before the war, hotels refused her a room. She and her white husband might offend Southern clients. So, I decided to leave. If a star like me was treated that way in New York, I hated to think what could happen down south. I made up my mind to look the beast in the eye. I planned my trip well. I wouldn't travel as Josephine Baker, the French star. I wanted to be a simple black American, an ordinary Miss Brown. I found the name amusing. Everywhere I went, there were two of everything. Two waiting lounges, two coffee shops, two rest rooms. I went into the coffee shop with a sign saying "white". As I passed the tables, everyone stared at me. "Two sandwiches, please," I asked. The waitress quickly handed me my sandwiches and took my money, as if trying to get rid of me. Then I went into the black folks coffee shop. I expected at least to see an approving smile, a knowing glance. Not a chance. All I got was scowling, disapproving faces. Some people even looked horrified. We cannot at all underestimate the risk that she did take doing that. There were a lot of people who wouldn't have done that. But the problem again is she's Josephine Baker. She's going into a segregated establishment, thumbing her nose at customs. Many social customs in certain parts of the South that have simply been accepted, as that is the way it's going to be, it's not going to change. And black folks know their place, and here she comes, giving them ideas about them out of their place. And then, she goes. All right? That's the problem. Was she going to stay and fight? Was she gonna deal with the aftermath of the repercussions of her actions? Therein lies the critique. For many African-Americans, when she crossed the colour line, she didn't cross back. She didn't take anyone with her. Um, and so, that was also a problem. It's not like Josephine Baker created an entourage on which she helped other acts along or did whatever. It was Josephine Baker and only Josephine Baker. On the one hand, there was fierce pride that she had made it. And on the other hand, there was a great deal of criticism because only she had made it. And so, she did not necessarily open doors. Josephine was deeply hurt by the criticism from the black community. After 20 years away, she had lost touch with the everyday life of African-Americans. Now, she knew that despite her ups and downs, her fame had shielded her from the brutality of segregation. It was time to use her privileges to fight for the rights of her people. Three years later, she returned to the States to perform in Florida. This time, she set her conditions before crossing the Atlantic. It was simple. I wouldn't sing anywhere my people were not accepted. I would only agree to come to the United States if black patrons were admitted to my shows. The producer of her show felt sure it was the right time to launch Josephine in the States, and agreed to all her conditions. Well, it seems that you do love me. I'll never let you down, ladies and gentlemen, sisters and brothers. Never! (CHEERING) Her contract stipulated that patrons were to be admitted, regardless of race, colour or creed. It was a historic event. For the first time in Miami, black people were admitted to grand hotels and exclusive cabarets. It was a triumph. People in the audience were in tears. Are you ready?

Josephine sang in St Louis, Los Angeles and many other cities. In Las Vegas, she publicly denounced the racist comments of a nightclub owner. She came out in support Willie McGee, a black man sentenced to death for the alleged rape of a white woman. Josephine could at last use her success to fight for her people. ♪ It brings back the sun, ♪ ♪ the music so tender ♪ ♪ It brings back the nights, ♪ ♪ tropical splendour… ♪ But an incident disrupted this honeymoon. One evening at the famous Stork Club in New York, where she was dining with friends, Josephine waited a long time to be served, a very long time. Until she understood that her meal would never come. It made her blood boil. She stormed out of the club, called the leading civil rights association, and made an official report of the incident. The next day, militants organised a picket line to block the entrance to the club. The affair blew up. Josephine had become a trouble-maker, was accused of Communist sympathies by FBI director, J Edgar Hoover. HOOVER: The experience of people in other lands, who suddenly found themselves… Josephine was declared an enemy of the United States. She left for Latin America, where she publicly condemned her country's racial policies. It was war. The FBI pressured Latin American countries, and one by one, her concerts were cancelled in Peru, Colombia, Cuba and Haiti. She was told she may never be allowed to return to the USA. She was devastated. JOSEPHINE: Whatever had we done. I had done my best during the War to fight the Nazis and their racist policies. But I saw the same attitude, just as insidious, just as ugly, in those who had opposed the Nazis. So, I went back to France. Since before the War, the place I felt most at home was at my chateau in Dordogne. During my travels around the world, I saw that people were mixing more and more. It seemed obvious that racial purity would gradually disappear. But I wanted it to happen through love, not hate. To prove that all the peoples of the world could live in harmony, Josephine adopted 12 children of different nationalities and raised them in her chateau. She called her family The Rainbow Tribe. And she was their prophetess. (♫ SINGS IN FRENCH ♫) The French had followed Josephine's adventures for over 30 years. They revered her as a dancer, a singer, an actress, and honoured her as a heroine of the Resistance. They even awarded her the Legion of Honour at her chateau, surrounded by her Rainbow Tribe. And yet, something was still missing. She yearned for the love of her native land, where she was still refused entry. But in America, times were changing. A young minister, Martin Luther King, had taken the lead of the Civil Rights Movement. In August 1963, he called on blacks and whites to march together in Washington to protest against segregation. Josephine had achieved what no black woman before her ever had, and King wanted her to be there. Bobby Kennedy intervened to lift her travel ban. At the march, Josephine was the only woman to make a speech. I want you know… …that this is the happiest day of my entire life. The results today of seeing you all together is a sight for sore eyes. You're together as salt and pepper, just as you should be. Just as I've always wanted you to be, and peoples of the world have always wanted to be. You are a united people at last. You are on the eve of complete victory. Continue on, you can't go wrong. The world is behind you. (APPLAUSE AND CHEERS) Josephine arrives at this major, major event that we now know was mostly organised by male civil rights leaders. The women who were involved kept being pushed a little to the side. That's a parentheses, but it matters. Josephine arrives, like an emissary from abroad. And that international aspect is not be belittled. And she is wearing… Miss Sex Symbol, the glamour object, she wearing the uniform of the Free French Army. And she didn't have to come. Just the fact that she flew across the Atlantic, not for her career, but to link generations of black achievement, of black entertainment, and of black struggle… …was absolutely thrilling. JOSEPHINE: Until The March On Washington, every time I went to the States, my stomach was in knots. For the first time, I returned to France with a sense of freedom. My struggle had been right. I went to Washington to pass on the torch to those who wanted to listen, so that they could have the same chances I had without having to run away. Now that my message had been heard, I could leave in peace. Fate had played a funny game on Josephine. She had taken the role of the first black star in history, but her battle against racism had been a lonely one. (APPLAUSE) Now, in her twilight years, her fight for justice resonated with a world finally ready for change. Her journey now belonged to history, and even made her laugh.
