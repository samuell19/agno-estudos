Based on a true story. In 1998 a restaurant in northern Iran is shut down because of health issues a familiar occurrence in those years. A bit later, three cooks from that restaurant were sent to prison for cooking non-livestock meat. This even made the headlines for a while, with articles being written about the use of human meat. It was said after several people disappeared, the police began to suspect the workers of this restaurant. FISH AND CAT Don't forget to ask for directions; Balaasar. It wasn't Balaasar; Give me that. Ask if they have any fish. Hi, I wanted to ask for directions... what's that smell? Phew! It's the smell of rancid meat from the restaurant. It's disgusting! How did you get here? We got lost! We need to get to this address. How did you pass the gate? The gate? Which gate? What road did you take? I told you, we made a wrong turn and got lost. Do you have an ID? What? Show me your ID. Why? How many of you in the car? Four. What time did you pass the gate? Sir, we didn't pass a gate. Show me your ID. Keep them awhile. Let's see they're up to. Was the gate down or did you guys pull it down? We didn't tear down a gate we just made a wrong turn, that's all! Where are you coming from? Tehran. Stop mentioning Tehran! OK Where are you headed? This address here It's clean! Do you want me to hold this for you? How many did you say you are? Four. Bring me their IDs too. Sir you're making a mistake. We didn't break anything, we just came here to ask you for this address. That's all! I need to check the trunk too. But we just... who are you anyway? Babak, Let them go, there's too many of them. It's risky. Do you have a place to stay out there? Yes! I mean no! We're going to rent a villa. All four of you together? What are you going to do for food? Hmm, we'll go to a restaurant. This is a restaurant. Here? Yes. Sure! We'll come here! This road is closed. You have to go back to where you missed a turn. Make a right and carry on for 20 kilometers. You'll see a sign saying “Chaman gol“. Continue on the winding road and you'll get there. We'll be waiting for you. Sure! Thanks! Make a turn, the road is closed. Are you ready? Start the car; I'm coming. We're out of gas. By the way, Mahmoud called last night. He wanted to speak with Hamid. What's that? What's that? It's classical music! Hamid gave it to me. His nephew recorded it for him Hamid said he wanted some music for the restaurant, and this is what he recorded for him. Do you want to listen? Did you know Hamid's nephew is dead? Dead? Turn it down! Turn it down! It's nice. Was that his only nephew? Yes, he's dead. So who gave this to him then? They speak to each other. They are somehow in touch. Talking to the dead is one thing, but the dead recording music for you is something else! Well, if they talk then perhaps he gives him music too! You don't think it strange that he talks to the dead? Ah! Babak! So that's why there is a constant noise in the background of this music! You're imagining things again! No! No! It feels like someone is constantly whispering something. Listen! What? Don't you hear it? No. Pay attention! Did you hear it? No. You're not listening carefully! Listen! You're imagining things again. And you're standing too close. I was saying; Mahmoud called last night. He wanted to speak with Hamid. He told me an interesting story. Do you want to hear it? Who is Mahmoud? Amir's friend. You met him last year. Oh, that tall guy. So, what did he say? He said Hamid's been shot four times so far and is still alive. During the war? I don't know, he said there are eight bullets in his body! That's a lot! Not only that, it's dangerous too! Eight bullets, shot four times, is that two bullets each time? If you average it out I guess. Six are from one incident. So that's why he never gets on a plane. Did you want to get on a plane? Yes. I tried so hard to get him on a plane once. He said he couldn't trust the city's metallic connections from up there! Apparently he once saw a play where the actress repeated these words, and you know how he likes convoluted words. So they stuck with him! He said he nearly got captured once during the war but escaped. Then he fell unconscious. When he wakes up lying in the yard of a house in a village, He sees his future wife looking at him! They get married, and then the twins are born He's told me this story at least ten times! We should do something about these traps. Someone keeps putting sticks in them. It's Asaadi the guard. Do you have any water with you? No. So what's in that? Does this look like there's water in it? You could have brought a bit of water with you. Be patient, we'll get there soon. I can't hear you. What? I didn't get that. Hold on, let me move a bit. Don't worry, we're fine I'll try to convince him to return. We'll see. But what can I say to him? Do you want me to tell him about the swimming pool. The costume-party? OK OK honey, bye! Dad... Mom.. These are the most significant names in my life. Always following me like a shadow. My dad always calls me. Kambiz! My dad always calls me: Kambiz..Kambiz. I can never get further than a hundred steps from him. That's our maximum distance. Kambiz! When he was a student he fell in love with a girl called Mahnaz, but he never dared tell her. Now every woman except mother reminds him of Mahnaz. Where were you? Look what I found! It's a woman's purse. I found it over there. Take a look at this picture. Don't you think this girl looks like Mahnaz? Who's Mahnaz? Mahnaz! My friend from the university. How would I know your university friend dad? My dad has repeated Mahnaz's story so often that we all know it by heart. But he prefers us to pretend that we don't know who Mahnaz is. This is an old game. I should go now. If you want to make a phone call, go by that tree, you'll get a good connection there. Dad, I won't be gone forever! OK! I was wondering if we could have a word before you left. About what? Do you have any problems? Problems? No! This is how all our arguments start, which always ends badly. I shout a bit, dad gives up, and I leave. He may retell some stories about Mahnaz too. I like them, but I don't care if I go with them. But you'll care once your mother finds out that you haven't gone with them. She said she will confiscate your mobile phone if she finds out you're not with them. But I won't stay without a phone. Kambiz, Your mother is sensitive about your university. I know. My dad thinks he once saved Mahnaz's life, when he was ten years old. He thinks they were neighbors then. He says she was about to be hit by a car and he saved her by moving quickly. He thinks she should have known then that he was in love with her. But I doubt this is a true story. Sometimes he says the car was a Fiat, other times he says it was a Nissan. Besides, when my clad was a student there were no Nissans around. Do you remember I once told you I went to a costume-party when I was ten? When I was 10? Yes. I remember something. Of course you do! I told you Mahnaz was seven, she fell as she got out of the car and was nearly run-over I saved her life. Yes. In one move. We saw each other ten years later by coincidence. We were going to the same university. She had become so pretty. But she didn't remember me at all! Could not remember at all that I had saved her life. Dad! Mina is not here. I know son. You said so before. I'm in love with Mina. She knows but I don't have the guts to tell her. I'm talking in general! Girls are forgetful. They forget so quickly. That's how their brains work. Does mom really want to go to the university? That's what she says! But I doubt if she can pass the entry exams I've got to go now. Don't forget what I told you! What did you say? Girls are forgetful, unlike men. Men pretend they've forgotten. But girls are really forgetful. Dad! I'm not going to see Mina again! And I can't take this from you and mom anymore. Who's talking about Mina? You! You're constantly talking about Mina! By talking about Mahnaz or mom! What has Mahnaz got to do with this? Mahnaz is over! Mina is over for me too! OK! I told you I'm not seeing Mina anymore! OK! OK! You want to go now? Yes. So take this purse with you, it might belong to one of your group. Once, instead of saying, “pass me that plate”, dad said, “pass me that Mahnaz”! I'm afraid he might gradually call everything “Mahnaz”! He may start saying Mahnaz, Mahnaz and Mahnaz, meaning Mahnaz, pass me that plate! He is forgetting everything. Dad, can you please go! OK, I will! Please leave now I'm afraid you might follow me. Excuse me! What are you doing? That's our bag! I didn't say it was mine! I just wanted to see what's inside it. Hi. You've got curly hair! I need to get some gas from you. Sorry, but we don't have any. I only need 5 liters. I'll pay you for it. It's not the money, we just don't have enough. You've got loads! 40 liters! Sorry but I am driving all the way to Tehran! Gas up in Anzali. You only need 20 to get there. Kambiz dear, don't wait, I will give this gentleman 5 liters to help him out. Now that you're so kind give us 20. Sir, I have none, I won't give you any! What do you have to say now? Is this water? Help yourself. It's warm. It seems like I upset you. Please leave. You've got an angry dad Kambiz! Please, leave us alone! You go on. I'll get some gas from your dad and leave. Do you have a cigarette? Did you pass a gate to get here? Do you see this? Make it clear. It seems overexposed I know, just make it clearer. Parvaneh! Have you touched my stuff? Don't start again! My lamp box is missing. I thought maybe you put it inside your tent. You left your kite there just like that. Maybe you left your box somewhere too. Well it's not here, what am I going to do? It's not my fault! Come on! Go see where you've put it! I can't. I'm busy. Busy with what? I'm looking for my CDs. Here? Not here, in the car. OK! Well if you find your CDs, look for my box too. I'll be over there Maryam! Thanks. Did you bring it? Yes. Thanks. Did you tell Shahrooz that you're leaving now? I will. It's Still early. As if Shahrooz will show a reaction! You should come too. What's this for? You'll find out later. And, this is for you! And, here you go too! Very funny Maryam! Be careful, this map is five years old. Don't get lost! OK Hello! Hi! Is this your kite? Yes. What model is it? Are you familiar with different models? I'm here with the Sharif University team. I have a fighter myself. It's a 14014 model P. P? As in: L M N O P? No, the number Pi. Do they come in pi numbers? Yes. The pi is their 2012 model. It has a lamp. Lamp? Yes, but I forgot to bring the lamps! I could have showed you otherwise. It's really big isn't it? What? I said it's really big isn't it? How strange! I've experienced this very exact moment before! What? Exactly what happened now! That you walk towards me with that lady and say what you just said! That happens to me a lot. No! I've seen this exact moment before! I think you were about to say something about that lady too? Yes! Really? Honestly! When you said lamp I wanted to say. That among us using kite lamps is forbidden. Why? We went to a friend's place in Atisaaz last year to fly our kites. Assal had a DELTA, one of those old ones with two straps behind them. An 1820. Yes. We flew our kites, they went up to 300 meters. Assal's string broke at that height and fell right on her face, over her right eye. The color of her eye changed after that night. We saw a lot of doctors but they couldn't do a thing. At first we felt that it's a terrible thing that has happened. But Assal herself was OK about it. She could see things others could not and this made her feel good! She became much quieter after that night. She kept staring at things. I think she saw people, trees, the sky, and everything else differently. P? As in: L M N O P? No, the number Pi. Later that clay I found out something else which was very strange. I learnt that Parviz's cousin was my sister's roommate. Right on the other side of the world. They were living in the same room in Toronto! Which means that as we were talking about kite models, they were probably drinking tea together. And maybe right as Parviz was saying “How amazing! I've experienced this very exact moment before!” my sister was talking to his cousin about her university courses. She would have had no idea that I had met Parviz before that event. Sometimes, this is how a story is completed. Things turn and turn and then come together at one point. Later I found out that as I was telling Parviz that lamps are forbidden among us, my sister had been telling Assal's story to his cousin. Assal had a DELTA, one of those old ones with two straps behind them. An 1820. Yes. We sent it up and its string broke at 300 meters. Assal ran to catch it. It had a chargeable lamp. But it fell right on her face, over her right eye. Assal knew more than the rest of us that day. And it was this feeling of hers that led me away, she had felt that something might happen that day. I left Iran a year later and never saw Assal again. One day I saw a picture of her and in it her eyes looked normal again. I don't know if the picture had been doctored or if it was real. I always wanted to know what she had been up to. That night the charger hit her hard in the face and the doctors couldn't do anything for her. How terrible! That's how it was. Is that where you camp? Yes. But many of us haven't arrived yet; They'll get here in the evening. Where did you buy this? Toronto, Canada. My sister lives there. Really? My cousin is studying there. What does she study? Physics. My sister studies physics too! Really? Yes I'm Pedram! Parviz! I'll come over tonight and bring my kite. Great! See you then! Is this double-stitched? Hi. Hi. Hi, Mina, how are you? Good. Yes, it's stable when it goes up. So it won't twist in the wind? Not at all. OK, will see you then. Sure. Bye. Bye Miss. Goodbye. Parviz! Mina! How are you? Good. You? So tell me, did you see a strange person around here? Strange? Strange. What do you mean by strange? A strange pregnant girl? Even if I did, how would I know if she's pregnant? Come on! Really pregnant! Aren't you clever! I like it! You surprise me! Really? Wait a second. Shahrooz! Can you come here a second? So! What's up? As if you don't know I don't! Parviz! Nothing! I saw a strange pregnant girl, and thought I should let. OK, I think you're messing with me! Look, I'll show you an even stranger case later; How is it going Shahrooz? Fine, how are you? She's a psycho! Isn't she? Your imagination is twisted. Listen Shahrooz, I think I left my lamps. Can you please bring them for me? Thanks! Sorry about that! I'm worried the wind. Shahrooz! Take this! I gave one to Maryam, I don't want. What's wrong! You scared me! Well you scared me! Shahrooz! What? Anything wrong? No! No! It's nothing. Thanks! She is worried about you. Wait, I want to sketch you. Is this good? What are you looking for? I need to find the storage tent. Why isn't anyone here? Most will arrive in the evening. What do you want from the tent? Why didn't he come himself? He couldn't, it's windy over there. Here! Are you clone? Is this me? The story I'm about to tell you seems like a fable, I know for sure that it's true. Maryam's grandmother and her grandmother's sister were living. Somewhere near the Iran-Iraq border. In those days, people stored drinking water in. Aha! There is a point to it. I sketch the time and distance of whatever is. They always told each other weird stories about these. Stories about fairies and sprites. Stories that seemed like dreams. For instance they said that in one of these cellars there is and if someone manages to swim towards it, she can pass. Do you want to leave? Yes Maryam, it's dangerous. Have you taken everything? Yes. Shall I check? Of course. Gently! Shahrooz? Where did you go? Shahrooz? Stop playing! Shahrooz! I know you're right here! Shahrooz! You're an idiot! You gave me a heart attack! One night her sister comes to Maryam's grandmother and. The two go into the cellar. They wait there until the light reappears. Why have they attached these to the trees? I think it's for the music tonight Woodstock-like! Parviz! Is this it? I said, is this it? Turn it around. What? Didn't hear you. I said turn it around! Wasn't there a backpack? This was the only one there. No! If I make a speech tonight will my voice be heard out. Never mind Shahrooz! Thanks, it's not this one, I'll. OK As soon as the light appears, the sister jumps into. Maryam's grandmother waits and waits but sees. She becomes scared and runs to get some help. Thanks! Well, I'll head off now! He said this wasn't his bag; I'll put it back. Do you want to know where I'll go? I'd rather you stayed. People came to look for her; A few men got into the water. The next day the city officials drained all the cellars. See that? So what? Do you know how far that is? Won't you give me your USB? Thanks! Will you be back by nightfall? Yes, I think so. You're joyful! Mr. Jolly! How come you suddenly left? And now! Why-are-you-so-very-alone? Is there someone else here too? Someone is missing. Maral. I don't know who that is. Your problem isn't that you don't know Maral. Your problem is your attitude. So who's Maral? What are you doing now? I want to attach a piece of wood to this rod. Maral arrived early this morning. She said she'd go find a restaurant to get. But she hasn't returned yet. Some people went to look for her but couldn't find her. Now they are wondering what's happened. That's it. About Maral! What do you want the wood for? I want a little piece of wood to attach to this rod! $0? So! What does Maral look like? ls she pretty? You're so I'll pretend I didn't hear that. Look at that cat. How cute. Yes I've seen it, it's cute. Come here kitty! Have an apple! What's that in her mouth? It looks like a human finger! Don't be stupid! It won't come. How do you know Jolly? She might! Now tell me, why did you arrive so late? My dad drove me! Your dad? Did he ask about me? Did you tell him. Yes, he asked I said you're here too. Bravo! You've become a real man! Why do you look so annoyed? I'm sure he hasn't left. He is around here. What do you mean? I mean he is checking on us. Checking on us? Can you stop making these silly looks! Oh so you see me? You're so predictable. Come on! You didn't even see my face, did you? I mean, he hasn't left I'm not too sure! I need to go check for myself. Go where? Don't worry, I want to have a little chat with Mina! Hi! I saw you earlier but didn't think you were with us. You're camping here too? Yes. Can you tell me what model your kite is? It's an old one. I'm assembling it. What's happened to your head? It's nothing. What's your name? Name? I need to note everyone's name and their kite model. Kambiz Mofidi. Thanks. What's your kite model number? Kambiz? Sorry! I said, what's your kite model number? I don't know the number! I'm not very professional. Sometimes I come here to be with my friends. I'm Parviz, if you need me. Got to go. Sure. He's the one who came with his dad. Wow! There are so many of them. Look at that one trying to make a call, you and your mess Babak! Shall I continue? Mahmoud said Hamid was shot by 8 bullets at 4 times. Six in one incident, you're left with two bullets. That makes a total of eight bullets. And? Well, Mahmoud said he was shot four times, not three! If you pay attention you'll realize Hamid lies a lot these. For example what he says about the twins. You're always looking for a reason to criticize Hamid. Mahmoud told the story about the bullets and he. They were in the middle of a shootout when the horse. He became unconscious. Wait a second. Where are you going? I need to do something. Don't stand there, go back into the woods. Let's go! Be careful. I think one of them saw me. You are too careless these days. You're a respectable man. But what have you done here? Babak, handle Mr. Assadi. The gate valve here needs a slight adjustment. It will only take a second. They only need to turn it off overnight to avoid. You! Where were you last night? I called you for an hour, came to your door and called I came all the way to your restaurant! There was smoke coming out of your chimney, why. I came to say that I am going to call the boss today. How far is it from here to the gate anyway? If you don't feel like walking or can't do it, it doesn't matter! I'll come myself to turn it off. It flooded everywhere last night! What a. Why should you keep the keys for the water. No! No! I've got to call the boss! He shall deal with all of us! Why have you put all these traps between the trees? Do you think it's legal? Is that how you find meat for the restaurant? If you don't find our thief, we'll complain about you too! What? Complain? What a mess! Now I owe you! Ridiculous! What's going on? What has it got to do with you? Has something happened? This place is so lawless! It's like I'm talking. Now you're asking me if something's happened? Bloody bastards... Parvaneh! Have you touched my stuff? Don't start again! My lamp box is missing. I thought maybe you put it inside your tent. You left your kite there just like that. Maybe you left your box somewhere too. Well it's not here, what am I going to do? It's not my fault. Come on! Go see where you've put it! - I can't. I'm busy. - Busy with what? I'm looking for my CDs. - Here? - Not here, in the car. OK! Well if you find your CDs, look for my box too. I'll be over there. Where are you going? Here. What's this? What the hell! You scared me! Sorry! I called but you didn't hear I needed to tell you something about the valve. What valve? Your camp's valve is connected to our place too. Water's been flooding everywhere; It needs to be fixed. And? And one of you has to come with me to fix it. It's your camp not ours! It's none of my business sir. You scared me; I don't even know what you're talking about! I'm sorry. I called but you didn't hear. It's an emergency. The gatekeeper has gone to call the boss. If he sees what's happened here, he'll kick us all out! I'm sorry but I don't know anything about this place I do. You just need to come with me a second so I can adjust the valve. Which valve? I don't know anything about it. And I don't know my way around here. It's up there; It serves your camp. It needs to be fixed otherwise there will be a flood everywhere. What am I supposed to do? You just need to come with me. This is your camp site not ours. It's not ours either! Go by yourself. I don't think it will matter I don't know anything about these sorts of things and can't help you. It's not possible. I know how to fix it myself; You just need to come with me. Sir, I don't understand what has happened here. Can you please explain it again? There has been a flood, and water is getting everywhere. $0? Well do you want to stay here or not? The boss will come and kick you all out! You just need to come with me. - Where is it? - It's near here, right over there. But I am no help to you! You just need to come with me; That's all. OK You go on. I will follow. Thanks. Where are you going? I don't know! I'll go with this guy for a minute and will come back. Didn't you say it was right here? It's just over there; Please come. We're almost there. Wait here a second, I'll be back. Excuse me, where did you go? Sir? Did you think I'd gone to the toilet? I brought you some water. I saw your hands were dirty. I thought you might want to wash them. Here. Pull your sleeves up so they don't get wet. Higher, higher. Pull up the other sleeve too. There you go. Between the fingers. That's it. Your skin is so dry. Do you know what this is? No. Disinfectant wipe, it's from Europe. Did I upset you? No. You didn't thank me; I thought maybe you got upset. Thank you very much. We're nearly there. The valve is right there. You go ahead, I'll tie my shoelace and follow you. Carry on, It's straight ahead. Where are you going? It's right here! Give me the key please. What key? The key for the lock I have no key! Didn't we talk about the key? Didn't that guy give you a key? Which guy? You didn't say anything! I'm such an idiot! I thought I mentioned the key! So why did you come with me then? Give me your knife. I might be able to use it. What would you say if I told you I made a mistake? I cut the gatekeeper's telephone cord! Let me go and see who has the keys! Don't you have a phone? It has no reception here, there is only the two of us. - You're leaving? - Yes, I am going to go find the keys! They might be with Parviz! - Is he with your group? - Who? This Parviz guy? Yes! You stay here; I'll go bring the keys! No we can fix it ourselves. But you saw that we couldn't. You stay here. I'll bring the keys I'll come with you if you leave. I enjoy walking with you. Are you upset with me? It was really necessary; Otherwise I wouldn't have dragged you here. Are you guys here for a particular reason? Yes. A gathering? It is a festival. And does this festival have a champion? I mean is anyone going to win? Yes. Not just one person. There is a competition. We fly kites. And then a team will win. It's a shame that this will be its last year! They say the world is ending tonight, haven't you heard? I saw your friends here last year. They had kites with lamps. The sky was full of light! It was beautiful I could see the lights for several nights. I even saw two lights in my closet once! I was not imagining it; I really saw them. I guess it happens sometimes. Shahrooz! Anything wrong? No, It's fine. I really want to come and see the kites tonight. I'm sure it will be amazing! That's Parviz, I'll ask him. Did you find the lamps? No, I came with this guy! Hi! How are you? Does this have a lamp? Yes. He is looking for the keys to the lid. What lid? The cover of a water valve; We use the same valve as your camp. This is not our camp. It's the university's campsite I mean where you're camping now. It's flooded everywhere and we need to fix it. There has been a thief going around too; We want to catch him. I saw the gatekeeper arguing with you a few minutes ago. So you saw for yourself! I don't have the keys but I'll try to call my friends to see who might have it. There is no reception here. Yes, no reception here. Mine works. Why isn't this one working? Did I disturb you at a bad moment? No, I'll ask around for you. It's windy here and I'm afraid My friend over there is unloading some stuff, I'll just go over and help him. If you wait a bit, I'll ask my friends to see who might have it. No problem! If you find it just give me a shout or give it to her. They are calling you. Are you sure? OK ls this it? I said, is this it? Turn it around. What? Didn't hear you I said turn it around! Wasn't there a backpack there? This was the only one there. No! A backpack? Never mind Shahrooz! Thanks, it's not this one, I'll come fetch it myself. Thanks! Ladan! What are you doing here? I thought I might find you here. How are you? What's happened to your head? It's nothing! When did you come back? Around 5 months ago. Are you still in school? Me? Yes, I'm still studying. You were always studying! You're going to be a mother! It's our son. When will he be born? Next month. I wanted to use the swing so he won't be scared of heights. We got married last year. Yes I found out. Who told you? Nobody told me. I found out on Facebook Facebook? But you're not on Facebook. lam. I am one of your friends too but not with my own name. With another name? Siavash. Siavash! You write interesting stuff Siavash! Siavash! Is Zohreh there too? Yes, she is. Does she act? Not really, she once passed a screen test. She went on set and asked for her chair to have her name on it! Have a what? Her name; Like those that are printed on the back of chairs. I see! She didn't want to appear from the third world!! And then? She was fired! Poor girl! What? What? What? Nothing. Why are you looking at me like that? No reason. Have I changed a lot? Yes, you've changed a lot. You've gotten old. Really? I'm joking! Silly! You haven't really changed but now there are two sides to you. One side has not changed at all, but the other has changed a lot. You finally got what you wanted! You became the youngest mother in the world! Yes. How long will you be here for? I'll leave before nightfall. I came here to see you guys, then Jean-Phillip will come to get me. How is he? He's well. What do you do there? I work in one of the best graphic design firms in Lyon. How cool! Yes. Why did you come here like this? You could have waited for the baby to be born there. I wanted him to be born here. Really? You do the opposite of what everyone else does! People tend to go abroad to give birth! Well, I've always been different! Ladan? Have you thought about names for your baby? Yes. What? I can't tell you. Why not? It's best not to say now. You'll find out later. How will I find out? I'll share his name and photos with Siavash on Faceook. You can ask him. OK Well, I should go now. Didn't you want to sit on the swing? It's pointless. I tested all the trees here before. They are all useless! I'll go to the other side. Ladan. Wait a second; I want to show you something. I still have all seven of these. How terrible! I wish I'd never given you the first one. Ladan sweetheart, can you look at me? We are seeing each other after three years! I am showing you something you gave me and you say such a terrible thing? What do you mean? What do you expect me to say? Do you want me to say I am delighted that you kept these? Thanks a lot! That's it. You have not changed at all! You're still the same. Just saying things to avoid talking to me. It was never like this. It was always like this. You always wanted to interpret my words the way you liked. Because they were not in your interest. Can you stop this? What difference does it make now? Even back then I couldn't understand you. Because even in those clays you were listening to the French guy. It was nice to see you. Bye! Can I take a picture of you? Why do you want my picture? I want it for Siavash. He's got no profile picture on Facebook. Hi! Hi! I saw you earlier but didn't think you were with us. You're camping here too? Yes. Can you tell me what model your kite is? It's an old one. I'm assembling it. What's happened to your head? It's nothing. What's your name? Name? I need to note everyone's name and their kite model. Kambiz Mofidi. Thanks. What's your kite model number? Sorry! I said, what's your kite model number? I don't know the number! I've had it for about two years. I'm not very professional. Sometimes I come here to be with my friends. I'm Parviz by the way, if you need me. Got to go. Sure! Parvaneh! Parvaneh! Have you touched my stuff? Don't start again! My lamp box is missing. I thought maybe you've put them inside the tent. You left your kite there just like that. You've probably left your box somewhere too. But it's not there now! What am I going to do? It's not my fault. Come on! Go see where you've put it! I can't. I'm busy. Busy with what? I'm looking for my CDs. Here? Not here, in the car. OK! Well if you find your CDs, look for my box too. I'll be there. Where are you going? Shall we tease her a little? No! Are you upset? Did you just ask him to come? And where was he standing? Next to that girl's car. Let me scare her a little! It's not nice! What? I wasn't talking to you, I was talking to Jamshid. Jamshid? Last night I dreamt that in the middle of this lake there was another planet in the sky! Jamshid flew here and there like superman. That's not like him at all. I've never seen him disappear for no reason or pass through a wall. He does bizarre things only in my dreams. Last night in my dream he was constantly flying, coming and going. Then suddenly he flew towards that planet and I lost sight of him. I was walking all alone by the lake. Everyone had suddenly disappeared. As I was walking I saw Jamshid standing beside a giant box of matches. By giant I mean it was 10 meters high. He had put a tall ladder next to the box and was guiding all the members of our camp into the box. When everyone was inside he pushed the ladder away into the water. Then he started to squeeze the box to make it smaller and smaller until it became the size of a real matchbox. He then came towards me and opened the box, took out one of the people who looked like a match and lit him. He held it near me and in an official manner I said, “You're so amazing!” There was a cigarette between my lips. I lit my cigarette with the flame but it kept getting taller as I smoked it! Jamshid says the interpretation of this dream is that I fancy him. You probably think I am crazy. No darling, that's not what I think. Wait a second. My third conversation with Nadia, 20th of December at 10 am. Please answer near this so that I can record you clearly, okay? What is his profession? Now or before? Now? Or before? Is he employed now? Yes! He is a messenger now. A messenger? What does that mean? Does he take messages to the other world? Do you want to make fun of me? No! I was being serious. I really didn't get it when you said “a messenger”! It is a job. I need to explain. OK What was his job before? Before? Nadia? Where did you go? I just wanted to see something, that girl Parvaneh! Your eyes are wandering! What is he saying? I used to be a journalist. Really? I had no idea! What is he saying? He used to be a journalist. OK! Ask him what happened to him? I have no desire to talk about it! Just assume that I had a political problem. Political? Why don't you repeat my questions to him? Because he can hear you himself. Doctors and their ideas about us! So why did he say “political”? He doesn't like to talk about his old job. Fair enough. Tell me about his current job. The messenger thing! He is a messenger, meaning he does stuff that are like miracles. For your information! To know you are not the only one who can check out other people. What do you really think about me? I don't understand! ls this about the same story you were telling me before? No! This was something between Jamshid and I. Look Nadia, if you want to help me then you should pay attention to me and not talk to Jamshid constantly, OK? Say OK! So you can avoid talking about that girl? I'm talking to you! OK sure, just stay here a minute. Wait a second Jamshid! I'm going to tell her, are you ok with that? Tell her what? About our relationship! What about our relationship, the fact that you've become a detective and are always suspicious of me? Am I a detective or you who are constantly moving around like one? I have a reason for that. Jamshid have you brought me to a place again where a terrible thing has happened before? No! Promise? I promise. Nadia! Come back! Go to her. Do you? Go now! Do you? Go.. Tell her the story of your mom.. For example, my mom told a story to my previous doctor. Early on when my mom and dad met, my mom used to go out to exercise each morning. She used to smoke back then. She was exercising to be able to quit smoking. One morning as she was leaving she craved a cigarette. She asks my dad to drop her the lighter.. He gets a little annoyed but throws her the lighter. But he doesn't do it carefully and the lighter falls in the garden and gets lost in the shrubs. She can't find it and so she stops smoking! But eight years later when my parents were separating. As she was coming out of the court she sees her lighter by her foot! You spoke way too fast, she didn't understand a word. Which lighter? Not another lighter similar to the first one, but that very exact lighter! My mom believed that it must be sign. She picked it up and started smoking again. Has something happened? Jamshid is sulking! Didn't you say Jamshid is 40 years old? But he gets angry if you wave at someone? He is 40, but he's in love with me! He doesn't say it but I know. So is that all a messenger does? Not all. Can you tell me more? OK but let's head this way, I'm worried we might get lost. Turn your head towards me so I can record your voice clearly. When stuff like this happens. People tend to think it's a miracle or a very rare event! But in fact it's just what messengers do. Jamshid wanted to get to know me that day. He picked up and kept that first lighter so that my mom would quit smoking. But eight years later, when my parents were separating. He knew my mom needed a cigarette more than anything else at that moment. So he drops that lighter for her to smoke! As simple as that! Didn't you tell me you knew Jamshid since you were eight? Now, the story of your mom, the lighter, etc.. Based on what I have gathered, you were only one-year-old back then. You told me you've known Jamshid since you were eight! It seems like you haven't even read my medical files! Let's go faster, I don't know why he moved so fast? Anything wrong? Jamshid is asking me to look at these.. What are you doing here? I had a strange dream last night! I had a dream about you.. You were lying over there. And there was a cat near you with something in its mouth. It had your decapitated finger in its mouth.. We wanted to catch her but couldn't.. One day we will.. Are you with the camp? What's with your voices! Why are you filming? You should leave too.. Jamshid! Did you know what these two were going to do? Go stand aside! These are your camp's neighbors.. They were in the middle of a shootout when the horse got startled and turned their wagon! He became unconscious. He woke up and saw his wife standing over him. How does a horse keep its balance? I told you! When a horse gets old... I see. So that's why it moves like that! You really didn't know? Here is another one of them. Don't you think they all look strange? How? You mean the way they dress? No, their characters. They are so calm, so quiet. You mean they don't look like thieves. What can I say? That's good. That one was not bad I didn't say she was. I think it's a quality. That's the boy who came with his dad. There are so many of them.. Look at that one trying to make a phone call. There is no reception here! It will be OK! You and your mess Babak! Shall I continue? Continue. Mahmoud said Hamid was shot by 8 bullets at 4 times. Six in one incident, you're left with two bullets. That makes a total of eight bullets. And? Well, Mahmoud said he was shot four times, not three! If you pay attention you'll realize Hamid lies a lot these days! For example what he says about the twins. Do you really trust what he says? You're always looking for a reason to criticize Hamid. Mahmoud told the story about the bullets and he doesn't lie! They were in the middle of a shootout when the horse got startled and turned their wagon! He became unconscious. Wait a second. Where are you going? I need to do something. Don't stand there, go back into the woods. Off you go! Let's go! Be careful! I think one of them saw me. You are too careless these days. You're a respectable man. But what have you done here? Babak, handle Mr. Assadi. The gate valve here needs a slight adjustment. It will only take a second. They only need to turn it off overnight to avoid this mess. You! Where were you last night? I called you for an hour, came to your door and called. I came all the way to your restaurant! Hi Hamid! Hi! Hamid? Is it true what Babak says about your nephew? What is he saying? Did he really record these CDs for you? Yes. I placed two on the TV. You can listen to them with that new headphone I'm heading out. Sorry! Did I scare you? Yes! I was listening to music. Well, sorry. Hello! Hello! Are you from that camp? Yes, we arrived this morning. It's really strange! Do I know you? I doubt it! You are from Tehran? Right? Yes. Have you ever shopped from that bookshop in Niavaran? Yes I have! That's it then, I've seen you there. I don't know. I don't remember you! My beard has grown maybe that's why! Really? Were you a bookseller there? A seller? No! I was just joking! I am your camp neighbor! My name is Hamid. Maral. Maral, what a beautiful name! Thanks. Can I sit down? Sure. I remember this festival since it began in '98 back then only amateurs used to come here.. Now it has changed. It has gotten much better. It's a more serious competition. Yes there have been competitions taking place here for a while now. You are not one of those who doesn't speak to strangers, are you? No, I'm a grown up now! That's good! What are you reading? The Red Notebook. Did you buy it from that bookshop in Niavaran? No. Just joking! I know! Am I interrupting you here? To be honest I was heading back to the camp I didn't tell the others that I was coming here, they might get worried! But it's still daylight. They fly the kites at night, right? Well, yes it's not dark yet! I remember last year, I saw the bright kites up in the sky. It was magnificent! I stared at them so much that for a few days I saw lights everywhere in the sky. It was amazing.. I was here last year too. Really? Yes. Great! We had a great time. But it was a bit cold and the story of the missing girl was terrible.. Missing? That's what they said! They were all rumors. Really? Yes. Nothing like that happened here! I always brush my teeth before I read a book! I'm serious! Why are you laughing? Really? Yes! It's a habit. Do you have a kite yourself? Yes, I've got a twin one! A twin? Great! I've named them the Fish and the Cat. Fish and Cat? Yes. Why? It's the title of my favorite song! The one I was listening to when you arrived. What a familiar name! I feel I might have heard it somewhere. Maybe my nephew sent it to me. Can I listen? You mean now? Yes only for a bit. OK Put these on. Thanks! Can you hear? No. Let me see. It's there I'll play it from the beginning! It's playing- We were listening to the music and I think Hamid also liked It. But just a moment later something happens. Without me seeing, Hamid reaches for a knife which was under his sleeve gets it out and as I close my eyes slaughts my neck with a sudden move cuts the vane and blood rushes out and pours by a tree. I try to stand but unable to do so warm blood still running and pouring over my body. My clothes are colored with red blood and more and more. I try to move my hand towards my neck while Hamid now gets up and carefully looks at me he sees how I suffer. My eyes staring at the sky and blood pouring out of my mouth and nose. I now die before I could see my favorite music band. All happened after Hamid takes out the knife out of his sleeve. ♪ Listen, it's really nothing. ♪ ♪ There is no way out of this. ♪ ♪ Listen, this shall also pass. ♪ ♪ And the wind shall blow its memory away. ♪ ♪ It dances, the last leaves fall from the tree. ♪ ♪ As fate packs and leaves this dark town. ♪ ♪ The glass bowl broke. ♪ ♪ We however, confused. ♪ ♪ The last fish also died. ♪ ♪ The last branch withered. ♪ ♪ The wind will carry us. ♪ ♪ It shall carry our memory. ♪ ♪ Water will dissolve us. ♪ ♪ The town shall embrace us. ♪ ♪ Listen, the night might say something. ♪ ♪ The darkness might have a secret. ♪ ♪ There may be a garden beyond here. ♪ ♪ There may be a city with a song. ♪ ♪ The last cat sits and jumps in the water at last. ♪ ♪ The last fish will shake and wake from its dream. ♪ ♪ The glass bowl broke. ♪ ♪ We however, confused ♪
