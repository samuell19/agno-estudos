And I done tried to call your phone like five times already and you ain't answering. So I figured I'd called Jenna's phone to get you to call me back. - Yeah, you know what man, I had cut my ringer off last night so I can get some rest, I was tired. I just forgot to cut my ringer back on this morning. - [Greg] Yeah, yeah, yeah man, whatever. Look, stop chasing Jenna around the house man and get in here so we can lock this thing down.

Okay. Well, we still on for tonight right? - Actually, that's why I stopped by, to let you know I wouldn't be able to make it to dinner either because of the presentation. - Come on, Jenna. It's the third time you done canceled on me this month. And plus, you've been working a lot lately. - I know, I know baby and I'm sorry. I just got a lot going on at work right now. But I'm gonna make it up to you, I promise. - Yeah, you gonna make it up to me. Look, how about you give me your schedule book? You let me go ahead and book us a date right now. - David, I am not giving you my schedule. Stop being ridiculous. Now, I told you I will make it up to you and I will. Okay? - Okay. - All right, I gotta get going but I'll see you later on tonight, okay. I love you. - I love you too.

What was that about? (Greg chuckling incredulously) - Oh man, Jenna was just telling us about your birthday gift, man. Why you ain't wear it to work? - Man, I was gonna wear it tonight man, but she canceled on me again. - Aw man, cut her some slack man. We work long hours all the time when we doing new campaigns. You know how that is. - Wait, how you know she work late? - Because she told us, man. Come on now, relax. But look, did I tell you about my new potential baby mama who just so happens to be an airline stewardess? - No. - Man, there's nothing like them flight benefits to raise a woman's sex appeal. (Greg chuckling) (cutlery clanging) - Didn't you get enough of doing all that in college, chasing up behind all them women? - Look, you've been my best friend since forever, so you should already know the answer to that question. (men chuckling) - You are a wild boy, man. (upbeat instrumental music) (restaurant guests chatting) - You know that old saying, great day at the office? Fellas, we had better than a great day at the office. I can't believe you guys actually pulled that off. And those commission checks. You're gonna be astronomical. Shalom. - Yeah, so drinks on you right? - Yeah, drinks on me man. - I mean, I know it's your birthday and all, but you still need tax write-offs. What kind of friends will we be if we didn't help a brother out? - I'm gonna be honest, this is way better than spending quality time at the Home Depot with the misses. She's got this eternal home improvement list. I swear, if she brings home one more paint swatch. (Tom sighing) I don't know, I may have to stage a ladder accident or something. (man chuckling) - No need to plan any bodily injury. - I'm just saying. - Look, my friend, I'll gladly come over and help your wife paint. (Tony chuckling) - Watch out, now. - Man, this guy, he's so smooth. Every time we go somewhere, he leaves with no less than two prospects. - Hey, I used to pull it like that back in the day. - [Man] Just like that? - You know what they say, wedding ring, makes women normally want you more. But I believe Shannon gave me one that actually repels all the women. Yeah. (cellphone vibrating) Hey man, what's up? (cellphone vibrating) - Hello? - Hey, I know you're probably still mad at me but I still wanted to call and apologize about earlier. - No, don't worry about it. - Come on, David. Don't be like that. I can't help that I have a lot going on at work right now. And I thought with all of the hard work you've been putting in at your job and all the success you've been having that you understand. Look, I promise, after the next couple of weeks things will slow down and I'll make it up to you, okay? (call waiting beeping) Oh babe, I gotta take this. I'll be working late tonight so we'll talk when I get home, okay? Love you, bye. - I love you too. (ended call beeping) (upbeat music) - What's up, bro? You good? - Yeah, I'm good. - Then take a drink, man. We've had a smashing day today at the office, man. - I'm really not in the mood for a drink. - All right, I'll meet you at Luckys in an hour. All right. - Hey, hey. - Fellas? - My God. - You truly are the man. (Greg chuckling) - You're silly, man. - Hey, you still betting a thousand? - Come on, man, you really gotta ask that? Look, thanks to that gorgeous young lady at the bar, my weekend plans have been thoroughly solidified. Now, if you fellas will excuse me, I gotta go. - Hey man, what's up? - Oh man, I gotta meet up with this date I picked up earlier. You know a gentleman never leaves his lady waiting. - Wow, wow, wait before you go, hold on. Just to confirm, drinks still on you, right? - Of course, man. - Good. - [Greg] Hey David, put it on our card man. I'll see you fellas tomorrow. - All right. - Have a great night, brother, later. Hey man, what's up? You ain't touched your drink since we got here. (ominous instrumental music) (door creaking) (door clicking) (footsteps creaking floor) (ominous instrumental music) - Jesus, you scared me. What are you still doing up so late? - [David] What am I still doing up? What you doing coming in here sneaking at 12 o' clock in the morning? Plus, you wasn't answering your phone. You had me worried sick about you. Where were you? - David, I told you I had to work late. - Jenna, where were you? And don't tell me you've been out working all this time? What's going on with you lately? - I cannot believe you're acting like this. Now, how many times have I had to endure you coming home at all hours of the night because you told me you were working late on some project? Did I ever make you feel like a criminal then? No, I didn't. If you told me you were working late, I took your work for it. And you wanna know why? It's because I actually trust you. Plus, you've never given me a reason not to. Now, Chelsea and I were at the office until about 10 p.m., running some errands, and then we went to go grab a bite to eat because we were starving. Because if you remember, I told you that I had to work through lunch. And of course I saw you blowing my phone up but David, I'm not about to pick up and argue in front of her. This project is stressful enough without me having to stroke your ego every time I tell you I have to work late. God. (Jenna sighing) (somber piano music) - Baby, I'm sorry. Look, let's head to the room and get some rest okay. - I'll be in in a minute. I gotta take a shower, it's been a long day. - But you normally shower in the morning. - Really, David? Like, come on. - You know what, don't worry about it. (somber piano music) (David sighing) Luckys.

Perfect. Perfect. - Oh, how was your birthday? - Let's just say I've had better. - Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. I hope today gets better for you. - I hope so. (paper rustling) You know what, speaking of that, this might be a little bit outside the workplace but can I ask you something? - Sure, is everything okay? - Yeah. You and Jenna are best friends, right? - Yes. (Lisa chuckling) - Has she been acting a little weird to you lately? - No, not that I've noticed. Why? (telephone ringing) - Just forget I asked.

It's nothing to be embarrassed about, Mr. Gamble. I see it all the time. You just gotta decide, one, do you really wanna know? And two, if something is going on, what are you gonna do after you know? - I just have to know, man. (file sliding on table) (paper rustling) - Are you sure you wanna go through with this? - Yeah.

Listen bro, when I tell you what this girl was about man, when I tell you the stuff that she was trying to do to me. - G, right now I ain't trying to hear all that, man, I just told you. - And seriously, man, you acting real uptight for a dude who just had a special lunch, man.

God, you know why I'm working late so I don't even know why you keep bringing it up. David, the project is almost over, so please stop making things so much harder than what they need to be. - I'm not the one that's making this hard, it's you. - Are you really okay? Greg said you haven't been yourself at work either. - Greg. - And Lisa said you left early today without no explanation. - So let me get this straight. So I leave work early one day and you get a whole report about me, but you can come and go as you please without telling me nothing? Do you see the hypocrisy in all this? - Wow. Wow. Wait, come here. I think you've had a little bit too much to drink. Come. Hey, hey, hey, hey. - What? What? What? - You are working yourself up over nothing, I promise you. Okay. Here, have a seat. Baby, come on. Have a seat. (Jenna sighing) Let me get you some water, 'cause I think it'll help make you feel better and then we can talk. Okay? - Yeah, whatever. - I'll be right back. (David sighing) (Jenna sighing) Hey, I don't think this is a good idea anymore. I mean, he knows something is going on and I'm starting to get worried. (somber piano music) (Jenna sighing) I know, I know. I think we need to tell him the truth. I know. Okay, you're right. You're right. (Jenna sighing) It'll all be over next week. Okay. All right, bye. (somber piano music) - Okay babe, I got you your water and an aspirin. It'll help make you feel better. (somber instrumental music) - No, I'm straight.

And we wanna also let you guys know we appreciate all of the hard work and ideas you guys have. Now, with that being said, if you guys have any ideas for me, please feel free to spit them out while I'm up here, all right. So look, the way we wanna attack this new campaign with Silverline Entertainment, we need to know specifically who we're targeting? We need to know what age group we're targeting? We wanna target them all the way from 18 to 35. We also need to know, do they have money, right? Are they affluent? We need to know, are they tech savvy? We also need to know, do they have sustainability? So when we go for this new campaign, we gonna go at this like... (door banging) - Wow. Really? - Nah, that's nothing. Look, he always gets his best ideas in the spur of the moment and has to flush them out immediately. - Tell me something new. - Look, that's why we pay him the big bucks right? So look, back to what I was saying. (ominous instrumental music) (David sighing) (phone audible ringing tone) - [James] Mr. Gamble, what can I do for you? - I need to talk to you, but not over the phone. Can we meet in person? - [James] Sure, what do you have in mind? - Meet me at Prime on Orchard Lake. - Okay. - Thank you. (ended call beeping) (ominous instrumental music) (somber piano music) (chair clanging into desk) (teaspoon clinking on cup) (chair creaking) - So what's the emergency? - I need something. - Really. - Can you refer someone to me for a job? - I can. The question is, is that really what you want, Mr. Gamble? - How do you know what I want? I haven't even told you yet. - I know what you want. I've been in this business a long time and I've seen that look that you have on a lot of other husbands, more than I can count. In my line of work, it's not my place to judge, but I wanna make sure and my clients know exactly what they are getting into. For one, things aren't always as bad as they seem. Sometimes problems can be solved with a simple conversation. And even if they can't, you gotta ask yourself, can you live with the consequences if you pursue the alternative? Some things can't be undone. (James sighing) Have you tried talking to your wife? - Yeah. She keeps lying to me and brushing me off. - I see. - And knowing the fact that those two were together is killing me, man. - Okay then. Tell me what you want me to do? - Tell you what I want? Do you know what I want, I just told you. - No, you didn't. I told you I already know what you want. But you gotta say it. If you want it, you gotta say it out loud 'cause then I want you to understand exactly what you are getting into. You see, once you make that call and you set the wheels in motion, there's no turning back, Mr. Gamble. This is not a game. - I want you to give me the contact of someone that can kill the man that's sleeping with my wife. - Okay then. (pen clicking) (pen clicking) - What's his name? - No names. When you call, just tell him I referred you. He'll direct you from there. This is the last time you and I will talk. Don't ever call me again, Mr. Gamble. If you do, there'll be consequences. Is that understood? - Understood. (ominous instrumental music) (chair creaking) (door clicking) (door clicking) (keys jingling) (ominous instrumental music) (David sighing) (keys clanging on table) (ominous instrumental music) (phone audible ringing tone) (David sighing) - [Operator] Call has been forwarded to an automatic voice message system.

(ominous instrumental music) - Hey, so I finalized the ad placements for the Jefferson Tate campaign, and the launch is set for the 15th. - Can't you see I'm busy, man. (Greg chuckling incredulously) - Man, you ain't doing anything. Look, I need to send me the revised draft over so I can get it to the printer. - Fine, I'll get that over to you within the next hour. Is there anything else you need? - Man what is it with you, huh? You storming out of meetings, acting all moody and stuff. What's up, you on your period or something? (Greg chuckling incredulously) Look, I only remember you acting all out of sorts like this one other time, in high school and that was over a female. You and Jenna good? - Don't worry about me and Jenna. You just worry about those endless stream of bad helpers that you got. - Dog, you got one more time to disrespect me man. (phone vibrating) - Hello? (Greg sighing) - [Hitman] Mr. Gamble, I've received your message. - Yeah, thanks for getting back to me. - [Hitman] Meet me in the back of the shopping center tonight at 10:00 p.m.. Blink your lights three times when you get there. I will come to you. - Okay. Sounds good. (ended call beeping) (phone clanging on table) - Who was that? You look like you've seen a ghost, you good? - Yeah. Yeah. (chair creaking) Just a call I was waiting on, man. Nothing to worry about. Look, I'm gonna step out the office for a while. I'm gonna get those files over to you within the next hour. So if you don't mind, I got a lot of work to do. So I'll talk to you later. (somber instrumental music) (knocking on window) - Unlock the door. (automatic locks clicking) (vehicle door clicking) (vehicle door banging) - I don't really know how this works, man. - It's simple. You want somebody dead and you're gonna pay me to do it. - Yeah, okay. - This is what's gonna happen, when you're ready to proceed, we will set up another meeting at which time you will give me a current photo of the mark, their address, and $20,000 in cash. After this exchange has been made, there will be no further contact, other than a text you will receive from me to confirm that the job has been completed. After that, you will never contact me again. If you decide that you do not wanna go through with it, this meeting will be the end of it. And I don't think I need to tell you not to share my information or speak of me to anyone. (ominous instrumental music) (dramatic thudding of heartbeat) - No, of course not. - Good, meeting adjourned. (vehicle door clicking) (vehicle door banging) (ominous rumbling music) (vehicle horn honking) (birds chirping) (knocking on door) - Come in. - Hello, beautiful. (Jenna chuckling) - What a pleasant surprise. - I got you flowers. - You brought me flowers. (Jenna chuckling) (plastic rustling) - Look, the reason why I'm here is to apologize for last night. And I know things haven't been right between us. I just wanna get things back on the right track. - I know, me too. And my project finally wraps up next week. - [David] Okay. - So I promise things will get back to normal, okay. - Good. Good. That's what I wanna hear, 'cause I miss my little (indistinct). - [Jenna] I miss you too. - Look, look, I was thinking, let me go ahead and plan a weekend getaway for us. - [Jenna] Okay. - We can leave Friday right after work. What you think? What's wrong, baby? (Jenna sighing) - Baby, I can't leave Friday. - [David] Why? - Well, I already made plans with Lisa and Chelsea to celebrate the completion of this project. - Come on, Jenna. Due to everything we've been going through the last few weeks. - I know. - Can't you reschedule that? - I mean, but that wouldn't be fair to them. We already had it planned. You're just coming up with this spur of the moment. - Spur of the moment. Jenna, I'm trying to save our marriage here but you keep on avoiding discussion and I'm getting tired of it. - Okay. All right. You're right, we do need to set some time aside to reconnect. - Yes. - So I'll talk to the girls and I'll see what I can figure out, okay. - Thank you. - Okay. - That's all I'm asking. I'm trying. - I know, baby, and we're gonna be fine. - Okay. - Just remember, after next week, back to normal. - Good. - Okay. - That's what I wanna hear. - Okay. Well look, baby, I know that you busy so I'm gonna let you get back to work. - Okay. - All right. I love you Mrs. Gamble. - And I love you. - I'm gonna see you later, okay. - Okay. - All right. - And thank you for my flowers. I love them. - Anything for you. (plastic rustling) (phone audible ringing tone) Hey Greg, so he just left here and now he wants to plan a trip for next week. This is not going the way we planned. I don't know how long I can keep lying to him. (somber instrumental music) (Jenna sighing) (door clicking) (door banging) (somber instrumental music) (boots crunching on gravel) (dramatic rumbling music) (knocking on vehicle window) (automatic locks clicking) (vehicle door clicking) (vehicle door banging) (David sighing) - I wanna move forward. (ominous instrumental music) - Did you bring the stuff? (envelope rustling) - The money, the photos and address is all there. (envelope rustling) (ominous instrumental music) So tell me, how do I know you not just gonna take my money and disappear? (envelope rustling) - You don't. Are you absolutely sure that this is what you want to do? This is your last chance to back out. (dramatic instrumental music) - I'm sure. - Okay. Remember what I said. Do not contact me and you will never discuss me with anyone. Believe that I know everything about you, David Lee Gamble. I will not hesitate to kill you if you break my rules. (dramatic instrumental music) Expect a text from me in 48 hours. (dramatic instrumental music) (vehicle door banging) (dramatic instrumental music) (fabric ruffling) (somber instrumental music) (paper rustling) (fabric ruffling) - [Jenna] Hey, my love, I know things have been rough but it will all make sense very soon, I promise. Let's talk tonight. Meet me at 5th Ave at 8:00 p.m.. Love always, Jen. - I guess this is when you finally tell me that you've been sleeping with my best friend. (David smirking) The joke's on you. Enjoy it while it lasts. (somber instrumental music) - Happy Friday (indistinct), my friend. So how things coming along with that new Blacksmith campaign? - Very good, my friend. - Okay, cool. Cool. - So look, I got Lisa creating some mock-ups for a few concepts I came up with last night. So hopefully they'll be available for us to go over by this afternoon. - Sounds good, okay. Okay. So how's everything going with the waitress of the new airline stewardess you've been messing around with? - Ah man, actually I think that airline stewardess might be wife material, man. (David chuckling) For real, man. She came through clutch for your boy, man, for this last-minute trip I needed to book this weekend. - Okay, okay. Where to? (Greg smirking) - Wouldn't you like to know? Nah, I'll tell you later on man. But I got a lot of work to do so I'm gonna check back in once I get the mock-ups, all right. - Sounds good. - All right, bro. - All right, buddy. (ominous instrumental music) Everything looks real good. We need to go ahead and push forward the pitch meeting for next week. - Cool. Cool. Hey man, we good? - I don't know, you tell me? - I mean, you been acting real weird lately man, and we've been really worried about you. - Well, maybe that's because it seems like you and my wife have been getting mighty cozy lately, and I'd be lying to you if I didn't admit I was feeling some kind of way about it all. - D, we've been best friends since college, man. Do you really think I'd do something to hurt you? - I would hope not. - Look, yes, me and Jenna have been talking, but that's only because she's worried about how you're dealing with her new work schedule, bro. - So why do you think my wife would talk to you, G? - Because I'm the only other person that knows you as well as she does. Come on, D. Look, this is all for the best man. Trust me, it'll make sense real soon. (ominous instrumental music) - Pretty soon it won't even matter. - And what the hell is that supposed to mean? - Don't worry about it. Look, I gotta get outta here. I gotta go meet my wife for dinner. (Greg sighing) - Really, man. (hour glass clanging) Have a nice date. (ominous instrumental music) (door clicking) (keys jingling) (door clicking) (briefcase thudding on floor) (shoes clicking on wooden floor) (somber instrumental music) You sure you ready to be tied down, dog? (indistinct) I'd have told you. Right, real life right. (Greg chuckling) (somber instrumental music) - I'll have some Perry now. (indistinct) (Jenna chuckling) (somber instrumental music) (glass shattering) (paper crumpling) (cupboard door clicking) (plastic rustling) (hangers clanging on pole) (David sighing) (light switch clicking) (ominous instrumental music) - I wanted to make sure I look good for you for when you tell me what you've been up to, my love. Then once you find out what happened to your little boyfriend, then maybe I'll take care of you myself. But we'll see. (David smirking) (ominous instrumental music) (upbeat instrumental music) - Hello, handsome. - Hello, yourself. All the excitement? - Follow me. (upbeat music) (Jenna chuckling) - Hold on, baby. - Wait, wait, wait, just follow me. Just follow me. Just follow me. - Okay. Okay. Now hold on, don't crash me into nothing. - You know I got you. - All right. - I got you. I got you. - What's going on? What you got going on here? - Babe, give me a minute. (Jenna chuckling) Keep following me. - Wow. Wow. - Surprise. - Surprise. (guests cheering) (guests laughing) (guests applauding) - Wow. - Happy birthday. - Happy birthday. - Surprise, baby. (Jenna chuckling) Greg and I have been planning this for you for weeks, okay, to celebrate your 40th birthday, and of course the closing of your big deal. - This is beautiful. - Because we did it after your birthday, we knew you would never suspect a thing. - You didn't even see this one coming, did you? - I didn't, man. - Happy birthday, brother. - Got you so good. - Thank you, appreciate it. - Yes. - So you had no inkling at all? - None, man. I actually thought you two was messing around. (people laughing) (Jenna clicking tongue) - This guy right here. - Wow, baby. - Let me talk to you. - Happy birthday. - Happy birthday. - Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. (Jenna chuckling) All right, love. (Jenna chuckling) - Okay, so I know how crazy I've been driving you with all the late nights and all the schedule changes, but you do see now, right? (Jenna chuckling) - I do, baby. This is awesome, wow. - Oh my God, between planning for this and the project at work, it's been crazy. I have no idea how I would've been able to pull it off without Greg. But we know you've been working so hard and we really wanted to make this special for you. - Thank you, babe. - Now, for my other gift. (paper rustling) - What's this, man? What we doing over here? (Jenna chuckling) What we doing? (upbeat music) Hawaii, baby? - Yeah, we leave tomorrow. I know how you always wanted to go there. And Greg got me the greatest hookup through his new little stewardess friend. (dramatic rumbling music) Can you believe it? (Jenna chuckling) Speaking of, where is he? He was supposed to be here at 7:45. Have you talked to him? (dramatic rumbling music) Babe, did you hear what I said? Have you talked to him? - Not since work earlier, baby. (dramatic rumbling music) - Okay, all right. Well call him and see where he is. Yeah, I'm gonna do that. - All right. (dramatic rumbling music) (dramatic thudding of heartbeat) (phone audible ringing tone) - Pick up. Pick up, man. (phone audible ringing tone) Pick up. - [Operator] Your call has been forwarded. (dramatic ominous music) - [Lisa] Cheers to the man of the hour. (Lisa chuckling) (David chuckling) Happy congratulations to you. - Thank you. Thank you. - Oh my God, you don't know how hard it's been to keep all this from you, especially when you started asking me if Jenna was acting weird. - Yes. - I should get an Oscar for that performance. (David chuckling) I mean, you've been cutting up these past few weeks. So you really thought she was cheating on you, huh? (David smirking) (David exclaiming) (relaxing instrumental music) Really? - Yes. Sure did. I damn sure didn't think they was throwing me a big surprise party like this. - Well, I mean, just make sure you give Greg his props for being a real MVP, you know. He pulled a lot of stops to get all of this together for you. He's good friends with Ulna, you know. - I didn't know that. Hey, excuse me for a minute. Let me give him a call to see where he is. - Okay, 'cause he's gonna be late for his own funeral. (relaxing instrumental music) (guests chatting) (ominous instrumental music) (phone audible ringing tone) (answering machine beeping) - [Operator] The number you have dialed is not-- (David groaning) (ominous instrumental music) (dramatic thudding of heartbeat) (phone audible ringing tone) - [Greg] Hey D, we got you good this time didn't we? - Y'all sure did, man. - Yeah. I swear, you were straight tripping man. I thought I was gonna have to put my paws on you at least about three times, man. No, but for real, hearing you now, man, makes it all worth it. - Hey, (David smirking incredulously) thanks a lot G, man, I owe you big time. - Yeah, you do. As a matter of fact, my bed-hopping stewardess came through clutch with them Hawaii tickets, didn't she? So you might have to apologize to her too. No, but I'm on my way man. Traffic got off the hook so I'll probably be there in about 30 minutes and you better have my drink ready when I get there. - Hey bro, just hurry up and get here. I got you, man. Hey G, thanks again, man. I love you, bro. - Still on your period I see, huh? (Greg chuckling) No, I'll see you in a minute bro. - See you in a few, man. (relaxing instrumental music) (guests chatting) - Excuse me, everybody, can I get your attention, please? David, Baby, can you come up here please? (David groaning) (Jenna sighing) First, I would like to thank you all for coming out to help celebrate the love of my life. Not only are we celebrating his 40th year of life, but we're also celebrating all of his hard work and dedication. And most of all, his ability to put up with me. (David laughing) (guests laughing) The past few weeks has been kind of rough for us because in addition to planning this, I had a big project at work that I was preparing for. So between the long hours at work and the secret meetings with Greg, planning this, I'm sure my baby thought I was having an affair. (David chuckling) (guests chuckling) But you had it together, didn't you, baby? (David exclaiming) Mhmm. (Jenna chuckling) Because I know that he knows that he is my one and only forever true love. (guests cooing) And I would never do anything to hurt him. (guests cooing) (David cooing) (guests cooing) Now, I wish I was doing this toast with his best friend by my side, but since he seems to be late per usual, I would like to invite you all to raise your glasses in salute to my husband, the David Lee Gamble. I love you, baby. - I love you too. - Cheers. - Thank you. - Cheers. - Cheers. (guests cheering) - Happy birthday. (Jenna chuckling) (upbeat music) - Thank you so much. - You welcome. You deserve it. - Thank you. - You do. - You put me through a lot. (Jenna laughing) (David chuckling) (phone vibrating) (upbeat music) (David groaning) (dramatic thudding of heartbeat) - Expect a text from me within 48 hours. - If you choose the alternative, some things can't be undone. (dramatic thudding of heartbeat) - We've been best friends since college, man. Do you really think I'd do something to hurt you? (ominous instrumental music) (dramatic thudding of heartbeat) - David? Babe? (David thudding on floor) (guests exclaiming) David! - Call the ambulance. - [Guest] Is he okay? - David! David, are you okay? David! (ominous instrumental music) David! David!
