Editorial Board of "Youth Flag" to Bessmertnyj We again draw your attention to the fact that you have diverted from the true the path of your work, which was visible in your first verse. Unfortunately you have not paid attention to our warnings. We are very sorry, but your poetry will not do. The Secretary. - Scoundrel! - Get the hell out of here! A day off. - Come with us for a walk! - Okay. Zoo - Let's go to the river. - Let's go look, me this way, and you that. I'll meet you back here. Gerasim didn't waste time. 4 Krivokolenny Lane, No. 8. Granya Bessmertnyj - Will you come? I'll wait for you. - Alright. - I've lost my hat. Let's go look. Where have you been? It's a big park, we missed one another. - So where have you been? - Natasha lost her hat, we were looking for it. - Come on, guys, Let's go look at the elephant. - Smoke? These are good - No, I've got my own. Gerasim waits for Natasha. - Alka, clear out! - And you, too. Get a move on! - My girl will be here soon. Get out. Home after a production meeting. At the appointed time. Natasha, our meetings and your opinion of me worries me... All that Sasha said about me is a lie. I think he would never have loved you, if your father were not his foreman. I'll wait for you today at the appointed time. Granya. - New love. It's a loose tie based of the organic desire of individuals of the opposite sexes. - That's a lie, that's not love, it's a dirty trick.

I'll talk to him. - I'm not suited for your love. - The woman I love today, cannot think differently than I do! - Get out! - What's happening? Yes, he's a scoundrel! And my daughter is a good girl! - Don't you dare come near me! - Oh Gerasim, how low you've sunk. - What do you care? Are you my husband? Or guardian? - Let's go, Natalia.
