(MultiCom Jingle) (slow, dramatic music) - Are you sure you didn't recognize anyone? - Hmm? - Well... We are going to Israel as the survivors of the Holocaust, so it's kind of like we come from the same place, you know? - There were a lot of concentration camps, Marcy. - I know. But wasn't Auschwitz one of the biggest? - One of the best. (solemn music) - Excuse me, folks, I'm Robert Clary. - Oh! - I hope that's not the funniest thing I've ever said. - Oh, no, I'm sorry. It's just that I recognized you from television. "Hogan's Heroes," right? - That's one of them. Thank you. - Joseph Rabin. My daughter, Marcy. - Hello. - Very nice to meet you both. I don't know if you're aware of it, but there will be computers in Jerusalem containing information on all the survivors of the Holocaust who are going to the World Gathering. Oh, I see you have your computer card already. - You're a survivor? - Yes, I am. And I'm going there to be part of a documentary on the gathering. - Oh, that's wonderful. Mr. Clary, I'm doing a magazine article on the World Gathering, and perhaps I could talk to you later? - I'd be very happy to. In the meantime, I think you should talk to Jim Henderson who's sitting at 14B. While he was a 20-year old American G.I., one of the first who liberated Buchenwald, where I was liberated. And like most of us here, he still has nightmares about what he saw. Should make a fascinating article. - Thank you. - You're quite welcome. Nice to have met you. See you later. - Bye bye. - What a marvelous angle. - Glad you came along, huh? - Glad? Do you know, I still can't believe it. - What? - Well, that you're here. All our lives, whenever Arthur or I would ask you about the war or the camps, you'd answer in grunts, if you answered at all. - So? - I know. Mom would always shoo us out of the room. "Don't ask your father to tell you horror stories. He's trying to forget." - Does that surprise you? - Well, what surprises me is that you let yourself get involved this time. Is it because we lost Mom? - Maybe. - Well, why else? - Maybe it's just time, Marcy, huh? Time to remember, like it or not. - Well, I have a plane full of interviews, starting with a Jim Henderson in 14B. See you in a little while. You gonna be okay? Okay. (mysterious music) (dog barking) (door closes) - Joseph! - Listen, everybody. Listen. The Nazis are going to blow up the ghetto in the morning. (everyone talking at once) We must get out! - I cannot leave! - Tonight! No, no, there's no time for talk. We have to get out, tonight! - Impossible, there are patrols everywhere! - The Jewish partisans will help us. Where's Leah? - With the rabbi. Her mother was too sick to come down. I'll get them. You see everybody's ready when I get back. Leah. - You! What kind of infant are you? - Rabbi- - You use these troubled times to defile a young woman. A child, Joseph. Who you've known all your life! - I love her. We love each other. We were going to ask you to marry us. - You expect me to ask God to cleanse your shame? Is that it? - Papa? No, please! Mama? (footsteps tudding) (solemn music) - Mr. Rabin? Mr. Rabin? Mr. Rabin. I'm Rose Becker. Am I disturbing you? - Oh, no, not at all, Miss Becker. - Call me Rose. Listen, I was talking to your daughter. What a lovely girl. She told me about your recent loss. Terrible. Oy, but my own Harry. Rest his soul. It's been almost two years now. But that's how life is. I mean, what are you gonna do? You have to go on, right? What's the choice? Your daughter told me you're a builder, upstate New York? - Middletown. - That's right near the Catskills! Harry and I used to go to Grossinger's on the Concord. Oh, he loved to dance. He was some dancer, my Harry. Ay. Do you like to dance? - No. - Look, it's no big thing. I mean, on a cold night, who needs a Fred Astaire, right? (both laughing) (airplane engine roaring) (woman speaking on intercom in foreign language) - [Woman On Intercom] Last call for Flight 37... - Okay, you open this one. Yeah. (woman speaking on intercom in foreign language) Yeah, you open this one? - [Woman On Intercom] Last call for flight 37 leaving from gate 12. - You come with me, miss. - Why? - Wait a minute. What are you picking on her for? - This way. - Think he knows Mom wasn't Jewish? (knocking on door) (man speaking foreign language) - This is her. Miss Rabin. Miss Rabin, Mr. Burkman. She had some books here and some pamphlets, and I think you might wanna look at it. - Anything here I should be concerned with, Miss Rabin? - I don't know. I don't even know what I'm doing in here. - Thank you, Aharon. (door closes) Sit down, Miss Rabin. - Is this really gonna take that long? - Have you read these? - Naturally. Have you? - What do you think of them? - I'm really not sure that's any of your business. - It is exactly my business, Miss Rabin. This book claims that the Holocaust never happened, that six million Jews, and millions of non-Jews, were not sorted out and exterminated by the Nazis. Anyone who would spread that poison is very much my business. - My father was in Auschwitz. - Yes, I know. Joseph Rabin. - How do you know that? - Let's see. You applied for press credentials, yes. Marcia Rabin, sometimes called Marcy, graduated Columbia University in New York, communications major. Have worked on feature news stories for magazines and newspapers the past three years. This is your first assignment abroad. One brother, Arthur Rabin, three years older, married, tax lawyer in Albany, New York. Any particular reason your brother and sister-in-law didn't join you and your father on this trip? - It just so happens that my sister-in-law's about to give birth any minute to their first child. Does say in there whether it'll be a boy or a girl? - Your mother, Mary Elizabeth Rabin, maiden name, Carmichael, died January... I'm sorry. You're a very attractive woman, Miss Rabin. Probably very intelligent, and your father was in Auschwitz. And I can give you at least two examples of women who had similar profiles when they blew up men, women and children in this country. I hope you enjoy your stay, miss. - Mr. Burkman. I read these things and brought them with me to expose their lies. Do I look like one of those crazies? - I have no problem with the way you look. (door closes) (gentle music) - Look! Look, everybody! Jerusalem! (gentle music) - Welcome to the Hilton. Welcome to the Hilton. Please, down there. - Where do we go? - Please down there. Please, down there. Please, there. - Hello. - Hello. Joseph and Marcy Rabin. - Rabin. As you know, the official ceremonies don't begin for another four days. Monday morning. You've got a full weekend. So if you'd like a guide or information on the tours, we'd be very happy to accommodate you. - Sam? Sam! Sam, it's you? Moisha! Moisha Djou. Sam. It is you! Moisha? Good God! Good God almighty. Moisha! He saved my life. This man, he actually saved my life. I'm only here because of him. - I was so ill, I could not move from the bunk, and he found food where there was no food, and... when I could not eat, he actually chewed the food and put it in my mouth. He gave me the heat from his body to keep me alive. (dramatic music) - See Dad, I told you people'd find each other. Maybe you will too. (gentle music) - You know what's funny? - Hmm? - I mean, everybody's Jewish. The tennis players, the bus drivers, the shoeshine boys, the cops. - And robbers. - How does it feel being kind of a majority for a change? - Less excuses, more responsibility. - Dad, you know on the plane the other day, when I was interviewing some of the survivors? - Yeah. - Well, they didn't hold back. They were willing to talk about everything that had happened to them. - So? - So, I've lived with you my entire life and I know more about Rose Becker's experiences than yours. And I'm not just talking about the camp, but things that happened before the war. Friends, family, neighbors. - They're all in vain. Marcy, I was 15 when the war started, just a kid. Kids played and went to school, grown-ups worked. What's there to tell? - I don't know. - Come on. - You're hopeless. (gentle music) (people chattering) (computer beeps) (tapping keyboard) - [Man] Jacob (indistinct), Jacob (indistinct). Does anyone know Jacob (indistinct)? Jacob (indistinct). Does anyone know Jacob (indistinct)? (people chattering) - Dad, look! Auschwitz. You wanna go? - When we go to Auschwitz, they separated my mother and me from my father and brother. My mother was too weak to work, so they sent her away. My father, I heard, died of typhus. But I never was able to find out about Johannes. (tapping keyboard) - Oh, my gosh, that's Woody! - Who? - Woodruff. He works for Newsweek. - Excuse me a sec. - Sure. - Hey! Hi! - Hello, Sunshine. I didn't know you wandered so far from home. - Yeah, when'd you get here? - Try 20 minutes ago. - Really. - Jetlagged, unwashed, and late. - You coming? - Where? - There's grapevine of a possible terrorist attack on the shindig. - What? - Security people here are having a press conference in about a minute and a half. - Well, let's go. Oh, wait a minute. I have to find somebody. Well, he'll be all right. - Who? - My dad. - Dad? - Mm-hmm. - He's a survivor? - Yes he is. (people speaking foreign language) - English, English. - Look, you've all been briefed enough about this. I've told you about the gathering, I've told you about all the security precautions we're taking. However, if you want to write about rumors... Then please identify them as rumors. We don't want to be accused of over-dramatizing for no reason. - Mr. Burkman, if they are rumors, can your office identify the source of such rumors? - The answer is no. Choose an enemy, we've got plenty. - Well, what precautions are you taking to forestall such a potential attack? - Those precautions now in place will be enlarged and extended. - Mr. Burkman, from your supposed enemy's point of view, wouldn't a terrorist attack against something as sympathetic as a reunion of holocaust survivors be counterproductive to their cause? - Perhaps in Hollywood, Ms. Rabin, not in the Middle East. After killing school children, and the massacre of athletes during the Munich Olympics, blowing up a few old survivors wouldn't bother them. The more repulsive their act, the more you will write about them, and that's really what they want, isn't it? - [Woman] How do you spell her name? - L-E-A-H, Leah. Leah Sculling. (tapping keyboard) Luds. - Luds you say? Would she be known by any other name? - I don't think so. (tapping keyboard) Does that mean she's dead? - No, it simply means that no information about her has been fed into the computers. Have you tried the camps? - I wouldn't know which one. I don't know if she was sent to a camp. Thank you. Ooh, would that computer know if anyone was asking for me, Joseph Rabin? - I'm not sure, let's try. (tapping keyboard) Also from Luds? - Yes. - I'm sorry, there's nothing. - Thank you. (people chattering) - Ms. Rabin. Please. I was patronizing when I answered your questions. - You were. - I'm sorry. I don't want it this way between us. - Why not? - Because I'd rather be your friend. Would you like a cup of coffee? - Would I be searched first? - Well, I must admit that's an interesting notion. (solemn music) - Where are you going? - You'll be safe here. I've contacted Jewish partisans. I'll come back for you. - You're going alone? - Faster and safer. Going on with older people and children... It's better this way. - Joseph! Take me with you! - Shh. - I won't be any trouble. - I don't know where or how long I'll have to run and hide. - I can help. - You can help here too. They're all very frightened. - Joseph! Come back to me, promise. - [Robert] I promise. I promise both of you. (gentle music) - Joseph? Joseph? - Hi. - What are you doing here by yourself? - Drinking. Sit down. - Where is your lovely daughter who thinks I'm so funny? - Marcy's working. - The gathering at Judana? Waiter. - You know, I saw you in the computer lines. Joseph, there are people here from 23 different countries. There must be some people who cannot come at all. - Because they're dead. - Are you looking for someone special? - Yes. - Is it someone from your family? A woman? I guess that's the story for most of us. - Not for me. Not yet. - What do you mean? - Just because her name's not in the computer doesn't mean she didn't survive. Someone might have seen her after we separated. One of those cattle cars in the camp, at some Nazi war factory. - Joseph, you can't just go around asking anybody here- - Why not? What else have I got to do? - You're a survivor. I would like to go with you if you don't mind. - Thanks, I can use all the help I can get. Let's try to find somebody who might've been arrested at the same time. They'd probably be sent to the same camp, no? - Sure. - When the Nazis destroyed the large ghetto, most of the survivors, both men and women, were sent to Kaiserwald. - Do you know what happened to them? - Well, Kaiserwald was not an extermination camp, at least not with gas chambers or ovens. I had another couple here earlier, the woman, I believe she was in Kaiserwald. Let's see. Yes, a woman named Sarah Villus. - Villus, do you know where I can find her? - She's here, right at the hotel. - Thank you. Ms. Villus? Joseph Rabin. - How do you do. - I'm Robert Clary. - My friend. - Nice to meet you. - Thank you for meeting us. Won't you sit down? Would you like something? - Oh, no thank you. - I'm trying to find out what happened to a woman who... Well, a young girl really, who was at Kaiserwald at the same time you were. A girl from Luds. - Ah, Luds, they came after us. I was from Bialystok. They destroyed our ghetto in August. - By any chance did you know a Leah Stoloff? - Last names we never... - Mm. - Leah? - Yes. - Leah... A young girl. 16, 17 maybe. - Yes, yes. - Slim, big eyes. - Yeah, that was her. You saw her. What is it? What happened? - She was pregnant. - The Germans found out? - Not while I was there. But I left a few weeks after she arrived. - But how did you... - Well, I kept a garden for the deputy commandant. When he was transferred to Berlin... Well, I was a pretty girl. He took me with him. That's the only reason I survived. - One army. Well, you were lucky. No secret about surviving, you had to be lucky. - Maybe the Germans didn't find out she was pregnant. - It was only a matter of time before she would begin to show. I am sorry. - No, no, thank you Ms. Villus. You've been very helpful, I appreciate it. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Mm. - Look, Joseph, at least you know she was alive after you saw her. You really don't know anything worse than that. - Dad, I wondered where you'd gone. David Brookman, this is my father. - Hello, Mr. Brookman. - And Mr. Clary. - Shalom. - Shalom. - I just have to tell him your name. He probably already knows what you had for breakfast. Big hot shot security person around these parts. - Oh, really? Is that like a part of Israeli intelligence? - I suppose it sounds more impressive that way. - Well then you would know. Is there an Israeli hall of records? A place where they would have archives of some kind? - Well, it depends what you're looking for. - What have you two been up to? - Your father has found out that a girl he knew in Poland before the war might still be alive. - Really? Who? - Well, a friend named Leah. Our families were neighbors. - Yeah, and so far, we know that she was in Kaiserwald, in September 1943. - David, do you think that maybe- - I could make a phone call. - Thank you. - Excuse me. - Thank you. - Well, wouldn't that be incredible if you actually found her? - Yes, it would. - Well, I'm gonna go see what secret agent double-O Burkman is up to. (solemn music) - Joseph, you knew the girl was pregnant. - Yes I did. How'd you make out? - Most women from Kaiserwald were transferred to Stutthof. Stutthof was liberated in April '45. The large majority of the survivors came here by ship through the British blockade. - What happened once they got here? - Sent to a Kibbutz, one of our farm cooperatives. - Yeah, but some organization must've kept a record of who is who and who goes where. - Yes, but it was a wild time. Accuracy was not a priority. - Yes, but there must be records. Where would they be? - Right here in Jerusalem. The department of immigration. I've written down the address. - Oh. Thank you. - Yeah, that's your next step. - If I'm gonna play detective, I better get cleaned up and look the part. Thank you. See you all later. - Good luck. - Au revoir. - Au revoir. Thank God for that. - What? - My father. He's been awfully down since my mother died and this is the first time I've seen him sort of perk up. - Good. Then I'll see you later. - Is that an order? - You know, if you could manage to stop being clever all the time, we might get to know one another. Shalom. (bells ringing) - [Woman] Shalom. - Shalom. (woman speaking foreign language) Do you speak English? - Yes. - Good, 'cause shalom's the only word I know in Hebrew. I'm looking for information on immigrants who came here after the war. - Yes sir. The '48 war, the '56 war, the '67 war, or the '73 war? - Before that. World war II, from the concentration camps. - Oh, that one. - Is going a way back, isn't it? Let me see. Anne, are you free? - Yes. - Ms. Lindelle should be able to help you. - Thank you. - [Anne] I'm sorry Mr. Rabin. There is no record of Leah Stoloff in any of our files. - Hmm. - Please, you must understand many used false names in case they were stopped by the British blockade. - No records of survivors from Stutthof? - Yes, but before Stutthof was liberated, dozens of sick, pregnant, starving prisoners were put on large rafts and abandoned far out in the Baltic. - Abandoned? - Mined, actually, with high explosives and timed fuses to destroy witnesses. Of course this doesn't mean that your friend was one of them. - Means I'll never find out what happened to her, doesn't it? - I'm sorry. - No, it's all right. I appreciate your trying, really. Thank you. (solemn music) (uplifting music) Leah. (people speaking foreign language) This is crazy! Let go of me. What's the matter with you? I know this woman. (speaking foreign language) I just want to talk to this woman. Will someone explain to these people? - Leah, please. - It's all right. - [Robert] Someone explain... (speaking foreign language) - He's a friend. - It's all right, Mr. Kunig. She just- - Leah. - It's all right. We were children in the war together. I just couldn't believe my eyes when I first saw him. I thought he was dead. - Please, I want her to rest for a moment. - Yes, Doctor. Come, Leah. My name is Saul Kunig. I'm Leah's husband. - Sorry if I upset her. Joseph Rabin. I'm here with a world gathering looking for family, friends who've disappeared during the war, and I suppose I was expecting, hoping to find someone so it was less of a shock for me, but Leah... Your wife had no warning. - It wasn't anyone's fault. Are you all right? - Yeah. - Are you in Israel with your family? - Just my daughter. My wife passed away about nine months ago. - Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sure when Leah's calmed down, she'd like to talk to you. Perhaps you and your daughter would come for dinner? - Be nice, sure. We're here in Jerusalem at the Hilton. - Good, good. Be seeing you. - Thank you. (soft jazz music) - Well, everything seemed to happen at exactly the same time. Like collision. I just finished high school, started my three year military service when the Yom Kippur war broke out. - So you never actually planned to stay in the service? - And at the same time, my parents divorced. My father went back to Austria. My mother remarried very quickly. Suddenly, it seemed I had no home but the Army. And the government offered me university education. Free. Never regretted it. - Well, that's important. Oh, what a night! Great little country you have here, Burkman. - Make yourself at home. (crowd applauding) - Well, hello, Mr. Henderson. - Hi there, little lady. How you doing? - Real good. David Burkman, this is Jim Henderson. - How do you do? - Nice to meet you. - We came in on the plane together. - Mirriam, and Ruth, I want you to meet my buddy Sid Goldstein. - How do you do? - How do you do? - See the size of him? What if I told you when I broke into Buchenwald, he looked like a stick of firewood. Nothing but ribs, elbows, and knees. - I've been hungry ever since. (all chuckling) - Well, nice seeing you folks. - Nice seeing you again. Bye bye. - Shalom. - [David] You are gonna put that into the article? - Of course. But it's not what you put in, it's what you leave out. - Well, nobody will know what you leave out. - I'll know. And see, that's what separates the good from the ordinary. - Of course, I'm sorry. - [Marcy] For what? - I think I was patronizing you again instead of appreciating you. I will not make the same mistake again. (upbeat music) (all singing in foreign language) (rhythmic clapping) (solemn music) - It's just tasting your view. - I don't like the idea of you leaving. - I'm not. - I don't mean tonight. I mean next week. - You planning on missing me. - Is there someone in America who's missing you now? - Friends. That's not what you mean, is it? - No. That's not what I mean. - If there were, do you really think I'd be here right now? - I've been trained not to take anything for granted. - That's not a bad idea. What about you? You aren't... You weren't born an hour before I showed up. - I'd never thought so. But now I'm not so sure. - That's so sweet. - It's also true. (gentle music) - Good morning, Ms. Rabin. - Good morning. - Late night? - Late. But I'm bright. How about you? - Good morning, Mr. Rabin. We hope we are not disturbing you. - No, no, of course not. This is Mr. and Ms. Kunig. - Hello. - My daughter Marcy. Please, sit down, join us. - Thank you, but I'm afraid I have a plane to catch. - Oh. Mrs. Kunig and I were children together in Poland. - What?! - Well, remember I was telling you I was looking for someone I knew before the war? Well, this is the little girl who was my neighbor. - I can't believe you'd forget to tell me a thing like that. Well, this is fabulous. You're Leah. - Yes. - And Mr. Kunig, her husband. - Shalom. - Your father surprised me. I'm afraid I acted very badly. - No, no. It was so sudden. And please sit down. - Well, one of the reasons we came here was so I could apologize. - Please, it's understandable. Won't you join us? - Thanks, but I'm leaving the country on government business for a few days, and Leah's taking me to the airport. And we thought we still have the weekend before the gathering ceremony starts. So perhaps Leah could show you, both of you, a little bit of Israel before that. - Well, that would be nice. - After I take Saul to the airport, I have an errand to run in Caesarea. It's on the sea. Very beautiful. I thought you'd like to see it. - Good, can we go like this? - Of course. Take a longer bathing suit in case you want to swim. - No, no I don't think I'll do that. - What do you mean? He loves to swim. Take your suit. - Okay. - I can't keep the plane waiting too long. - I'll pick you up in a half an hour? - Fine, thank you. Have a safe trip. - Thank you. - How could you forget such a thing? What's she like? - You'll find out in the car. - Would you mind if I don't go? - Yes I would. You must go. - Look, you two haven't seen each other for years. You probably have a million things to talk about. - Well, Marcy, that would be rude. - Dad- - Look Marcy, I don't ask you- - Dad! May I remind you that I'm supposed to be working here? - Yeah, we both keep forgetting. - Mm-hmm. - All right. - Good. - I'll get my bathing suit. (dramatic music) Does your husband go on these trips often? - Lately, yes. He's an economist. I don't need to tell you that the Israeli economy needs all the attention it can get. Saul told me about your wife. I'm sorry. You have a very pretty daughter. Are there any others? - Oh, I have an older son, Arthur. His wife's just about to have a baby. And you? - Saul had a family. A wife and three sons, all killed by the Nazis. When we first met at the Kibbutz, my health. And when we got married, it just never happened. - Leah. - I lost the baby. At Stutthof. - Sorry. - Joseph, why didn't you come back? - I did, Leah. (solemn music) I didn't find the partisans till the next night. But when I came back, it was too late. I tried to find you and my brother Aaron, and... What happened? - It was the morning after you left. It had been a long night. You didn't come back. The rabbi hadn't let us have a fire. He said it was too dangerous. Then we heard the motors. It was the Germans. The farmer had informed on us. They wanted us to come out. (shouting in foreign language) Brother Aaron said, "Let them come. Fight them." But the rabbi. He said there was no hope. Nothing to fight with. (speaking foreign language) (ominous music) And we had to give we women and children some chance to survive. (speaking foreign language) We surrendered, and came out to face the selection. The choosing. Who was to live. And who was to die. (ominous music) We didn't believe what we were seeing. They meant to kill these old people. Innocent children. (suspenseful music) (gunshot bangs) (speaking foreign language) They killed them all. (gunshots banging) The rabbi tried to save a little girl who had lost her mother. But it was hopeless. (gunshot bangs) It was too much for your brother Aaron. He went wild. It was a brave moment. (gunshot bangs) But just a moment. And then he was dead at their feet. I looked back at them, with rage. The rabbi. Your brother Aaron. And I felt ashamed. Ashamed I was alive. - It's not wrong, Leah. We all felt that way. Ashamed. It's all right now. It's all right now. (solemn music) Hey. - Oh. - Oh. Oh. (both laughing) Feeling better? Wanna go back? Neither do I. You know, I look at you now and I still see the wild blond hair, the hungry eyes and the skinny face. - I wish I had your eyesight. I see a beautiful day, a gorgeous beach, and why aren't we using it, huh? - Why not? (pleasant music) I can't take it. I am dripping. I have never been so hot in my life! Let's go for a nice cool cycle ride in the countryside. It's 120 degrees out there! I think I'm gonna faint. - Mm. - Well, obviously you're hysterical and I shall help to give you shock therapy. - Okay. (Marcy giggling) Not good enough for me. - It's a beginning. - Okay. (both laughing) - Sorry. (pleasant music) - I am too old. This'll look beautiful on you. (both laughing) Here, try this. Oh, that's gorgeous. Come on. - Would you like to take a shower before, after, or during? - Oh, you are depraved. Impossible to say. No, why don't you shower first? I really should call the hotel. Dad is probably wondering what happened to me. - Okay. - Thank you. Do you mind if I ask him to have dinner with us? - No, I'd like that. Give me a chance to talk to him. - Oh, about what? - The size of your dowry, of course. - That'll be the day. - Shalom. - Hello. - [Hotel Operator] Can I help you, please? - Joseph Rabin, please. Room 324. You better make sure he knows you're kidding about that. He's not so- - [Hotel Operator] I'm sorry, Mr. Rabin's not in. - He's not? Well, could you page him in the lobby please? - [Hotel Operator] Is this Ms. Rabin? - Yes, it is. - [Hotel Operator] I have a message from your father. - Oh, good, could you read it to me please? - [Hotel Operator] He says he's spending the night in Caesarea. Hello? Oh. Thank you. - [Hotel Operator] Good day, Ms. Rabin. - Well? Are we picking him up? No, he wasn't there. He's spending the night in Caesarea. - Well, then he must be having a good time. - With her? - Yes, I suppose. Why not? - Why not? Well, for one thing, she's married. - Well, if someone else told me you had just said that, I would not believe it. - Well, believe it. You've gotta admit the whole thing is a little bizarre. He runs into this woman he hasn't seen in 100 years or since they were teenagers, and all of a sudden he's- - All of a sudden what? Marcy, you don't know a damn thing about what's going on between them, if anything. - My father never wanted to talk about the Holocaust or anything that happened before the war. Not even to my mother. He never joined Jewish organizations or Israeli causes. Nothing like that. All of a sudden, my mother is dead a couple of months- - Okay that's enough. Marcy, stop it. - You should've seen him this morning when she showed up. He was all nervous and excited. You would've thought he was going to the junior prom. - Marcy, now listen to me. - That woman is the only reason he came here. I wonder how many times he thought of her when my mother was alive. - Marcy! Are you being jealous for your mother or yourself? - What the hell is that supposed to mean?! - You move back into his house after your mother dies. You worry about his health, you cook his meals- - He's my father, David. - Well then, treat him that way. It's his business, not yours. - Oh, is this the way you felt when your parents got divorced? - I was a kid. You're not. At least, I didn't think so. Where are you going? - Home to play with my dolls. Thank you for understanding, David. You've really been a big help. (gentle music) (waves lapping) - Thank you madam. Will there be anything else? - No thank you. Good night. (gentle music) (knocking on door) - Hey. Not bad. They gave me a room downstairs facing the street. Noisy. (dramatic music) (waves lapping) Good morning. - Morning. No razor, no comb. I never knew I could ever want anyone again. It's morning, Joseph. You're supposed to see clearly in the morning. - I see very clearly. I love you. (gentle music) - [Robert] Hello, Rose. - Hello! - Hi. - Hello, how are you? - Fine, thanks. - I'd like you to meet my friend, Mikael Vadnai. - Vadnai. - Vadnai. - Mikael! (speaking foreign language) - He only speaks Hungarian, no English. (speaking foreign language) But isn't that a smile, I ask you? (all chuckling) - Well, I'm glad to see you're having such a good time. - Why not? We're all running out of it, no? - What? - Time. - Oh. (birds chirping) - What a country. I came here old. Now I feel young. - Did you know that part of this city is 300 years BC? - Ah, looks like my first apartment in America. (Leah laughing) - Excuse me, are there any messages for Marcy Rabin in 702? - No, no, I'm sorry. - Thank you. - We'd better think about getting back. - Oh, do we have to? - Uh-huh. - Hey, will you come with me to the opening ceremonies tomorrow at... - Yad Vashem? - Yeah. - No. - Please, why not? - I can't, Joseph. I've been there once. Six million Jews. Six million nightmares. I just can't. - It will be different, now. We'll be together. Good memories as well as bad, hmm? - Not there. Not there. Besides, I should wait for some word from Saul. His schedule is unpredictable. (solemn music) You do understand, don't you? - Yeah, I understand. I understand that we're gonna be together. - Joseph, please. You are free. You are free to feel what you want. I'm not. Please don't fight me on that. Help me. - I won't fight you. But I won't help you. I love you. (gentle music) (knocking on door) Coming, coming. Hi Marcy, come on in. Boy, I'm starving. And I suppose you and what's his name have a date for supper. - No. What's his name is just what's his name again. - Mm. Sorry, honey. - So you having a good time with what's her name? - What is this? - She's somebody special, isn't she? She's very special, isn't she? - Hey... - She always has been. - What is this? - You will admit that you did come here hoping to find her. You will admit to that. - Well, I don't know that I have to admit to anything. - Were you in love with her? Excuse me. Were you in love with her? - Yes. During the war, she was 16, I was 17. That kind of love. - Well, what kind of love is it now? - I think you're getting rude, Marcy. Perhaps a little crude. - Were you in love with her when you married my mother? - Now that's just plain stupid. - Oh yeah, what's stupid about it? - Because I thought Leah was dead long before I met your mother. Marcy, it was 38 years ago. You weren't even born. - But it seems like only yesterday, isn't that how it... (Marcy gasps) - I'm sorry. I didn't mean that. Look, I'm sorry Marcy. I wish you could understand. I met Leah in another world. It's another life. We were two other people. - But you never loved Mom the same way you loved her. - The same way? There's no same way of loving somebody. Your mother and I loved each other very much in our own special way for 30 years. Nothing can change that. I didn't appreciate how much I loved her until she died. I thought you understood that. - Oh, Dad, I'm so sorry. I didn't mean it. I'm so sorry. I'm Sorry. (Marcy crying) - Everything will be all right. Everything's okay, hmm? Okay? - So what are you gonna do? - Hmm? - About Leah. - I don't know. I don't know. - Oh, will you forgive me? - If you get me something to eat. (both laughing) - Oh. (solemn music) When did this all start? - Well, in 1953, the government passed the law of Remembrance at Yad Vashem, under which all you see here was built in memory of the victims of the Holocaust. (solemn music) (singing in foreign language) (people laughing) (people chattering) - Hello, everybody. - Hello Marcy. - Hi. - Leah, I'm very happy to see you again. - Thank you. - I just had to come over here and tell you all that I think you're amazing. After that experience at the monument, I expected to see you all crying all over the place. - We already cried at the office. - Well, I'll see you later, huh? - She did that for you. - For both of us. (people mumbling) - Could I ask everybody to please move outside. Nothing to worry about, it's just a precautionary measure. - David, what is it? - It's all right, we're just paving the area for security reasons. - What happened? - It's a bomb scare. They get about a thousand a month. Mostly phonies. - You think you're finished running from bombs, but they don't let you forget. - No reason to panic. Please, remain calm and just leave the area as quickly as you can. - You get it from Burkman? - Yeah, right, that'll be the day. No, the word is a terrorist group slipped through the border last night. - Oh yeah? So that's what the bomb scare was about. - Ladies and gentlemen, there was the possibility of a terrorist problem here, but all precautions have been taken. If you'll all go into the press room until I have something to tell you, I'll be very... (reporters all talking at once) - Have you advised Washington about- - Wait, please! Wait, no questions. At least no answers, not now. The press room please, or I can't be responsible for your safety. (reporters all talking at once) Please! Please? (tense music) - Stay back. Stay back, please. (tires squealing) (klaxon wailing) (dramatic music) (explosionsbooming ) - Oh my god! - Marcy, wait. No, stay back! You can't go in there now, Marcy! Stay back! Not now! (solemn music) You wait here and I'll found out where they're taking him, okay? Marcy? - All right! - Okay. - So this is the Kibbutz I came to from Stutthof. My first job here, milking cows. Fortunately, only two. That building. The hospital. A converted barn, then. It's where I met Saul. - How old were you? - 20. - He was much older than you then, huh? - He was everything I had. He was my family. He was my father, my teacher, my best friend. He was safe. And after what I've been through, nothing seemed more important. My family was dead. You were dead. - But I'm not dead. I'm here and I won't be shushed away. I love you, Leah. You love me too, I know it. - It's true. But that is not the only thing that is important. - What's more important? - I'm married, to a good man. He's been good to me most of my life. We are not the only ones that feel. I'm sorry. - I'm not. - I'm grateful. Confused. Guilty, perhaps. Excited. But I'm not sorry. Not that. - Joseph! Joseph! We going back to the hotel, come on! - Ms. Rabin. You can see him now. - Are you really all right? - Better than I look, which isn't saying too much. You know, we have very good newspapers in Israel. Magazines, TV. Your American know-how could go a long way. - Even though I don't write or speak Hebrew? - Temporary technicality. By orthodox standards, I'm not even considered a Jew, because my mother wasn't. So my children wouldn't be considered Jewish. - If they happen to be my children too, they'll be Israeli. - Is it all right if I kiss? - I'll grit my teeth. - We who are the first generation, born after the darkness of the Holocaust, dedicate this pledge to you, our parents, who've suffered and survived, to our grandparents who perished in the flames, to our vanished brothers and sisters. Young Hanna, killed in the ghetto. Jacob, starved to death. Young Naomi, Yunkel, Tova. All dead in the gas chambers. More than one and a half million children so brutally murdered. On this day, we pledge to remember forever. And in their memory, we offer a silent prayer. (dramatic music) (solemn music) - Leah. I know, I'm sorry, Leah. I know. - You don't know. - Tell me. What is it? - I want to go home. Please let me go home. - What don't I know? - My baby. Our baby. I didn't lose her. I killed her. She was a girl. My baby girl. I killed her. I was afraid. Alone. All by myself. Having a baby. (solemn music) - It's finished, do you hear? The blitz brow is already asking when it was you had your time of the month. - Not all the women do every month. We're sick, hungry, we work hard. - My god, it's moving. - Just a little, no one can see. - Well how long, you fool? Sooner or later that belly is going to get you killed. - Frida, no. - Yes, you've got to get rid of it. - No. - Listen to me, you little fool. That baby is killing you. You cannot save it, but it can kill you. - I can't. - Then I'll do it for you. - I won't let you do it. I don't care what happens, but you have no right to. - Right? Oh, yes, I do. Every one of us has to try to live as long as we can. Most of us will die. But someone must live to tell how we died. Why we died. I would not deny your choice, little one. But there isn't any. What do you think will happen if the blitz brow catches you, hmm? Do you think they'll string you up and shoot you like a hero? They'll turn you over to the doctors. They don't get too many pregnant women for their experiments. I heard sometimes they wait till the mother is in labor, then just to see what happens, they hold her legs together. I know, I know. That's why I can't let you die for your baby. You must live for us. Don't you see? - There must've been pain. I don't remember. But I saw the baby. It was a little girl. They buried her under the barracks. All the years after, I blamed you for not coming back to me. It's not true, I didn't blame you. I loved you. But you were dead. (solemn music) - Now I'm alive. You still love me. - Still. Again, perhaps. I suppose some part of me will always love you. - Leah. - Listen, Joseph. I didn't try to find you or anyone else I knew from that time. I didn't put my name into the computers. I didn't plan to join the other survivors. I was ashamed of what I had done. - Oh, no, no. It was done to you. - It doesn't matter anymore. Now that I've told you. Now that I've been able to say it. - That's all part of yesterday. A nightmare. Our time is now. The other night? That was real. - It was beautiful. A gift we gave each other. (solemn music) I'd like to go home now. - Home? To Saul? I won't let you go, Leah. I'll wait here in Israel. I'll wait. - No. You will go home, like me. To who you are now, not who we were. To your work, to the promises of your children. To the friends of a lifetime you spent without me. That's good, Joseph. That's good. - Dad? Are you all right? - Sure. Fine. - Is she coming back? - No, I don't think so. I'll go back to the hotel. - Would you like me to come along? - No, it's all right. Thanks. - You know, after the war, I wouldn't go back to Vienna right away. Too soon. But I went to London. People were kind and generous, but you know, they still looked at us sideways. You know, concentration camp people are looked upon as freaks. - Yeah, same thing in the states. I used to tell them I was absent-minded. That's my telephone number. (all laughing) - They would say, "Were you in the Navy?" I'd say, "Yes, I was in the Navy." Who wants to argue with that? - Listen. It worked the other way, too. When I came back, people didn't believe I was in the camps. Because I didn't have a number on my arm like everybody else. I told them that not all the camps did it that way. - Some of us only got numbers on our prison shirts. - Rose, does Mikael there have a number? - You bet, and I got it. (all laughing) - Haven't you taught him any English yet? - Of course. Who's the most gorgeous creature you ever met in your whole life? - Rose. (all laughing) - And who are you crazy about? - [All] Rose. (all laughing) - That's all the English he has to know. (all laughing) (speaking foreign language) - Rose. (all laughing) - You I need like a hole in the head. (all laughing) - Hi. - Hi, Marcy. - Hi. Can I talk to you for a minute? - I'll be back. - Okay. - I called your room. Didn't expect to find you down here, but I'm glad I did. - Well, I'm glad too, Marce. Listen, sit down. Now, tomorrow's closing ceremonies, and that's it. Let's take an early plane out the next morning, huh? - David's asked me to stay with him. - Stay? - Well, it can't be more than that right now. We've only known each other for five days. - Hmm. - It would mean my living in Israel. And if things worked out, making my life here. - Mm. - "Mm." That's all I get is a nod? You don't have anything to say about this? - I don't think I have anything to say about it. What did you tell him? - Well, after all my schooling and all my training? And all the dues that I've paid in New York with TV people and editors? - So? - I know that they have things like that here, but for me it'd be like starting all over again. And then to try and learn a language just to get by. - Is that what you told him? - No, not yet. - Marce. You love him? (gentle music) - Yes. - You believe he loves you? - Yes. Yes, damn it. Help. - You think you'd ever meet anyone like him? You won't. Oh, you probably will, but you won't think so. - This is not the way I wanted. - Nothing's ever the way you want it. - Oh, Dad. I'm sorry. - Don't be. Not for me. I had your mother, you, and your brother. Sounds like a song. ♪ I had your mother ♪ ♪ You and your brother ♪ (both laughing) You know, the difference between us, Marce, is during the war, Leah and I had no choice. And now, with all the years and people in between, it's too bitter a choice. But you and David are starting off clean. If you do, you have that choice. - Mr. Rabin. Phone call from the United States. - Hello. Yes, speaking. Arthur! Fine! Yeah, she's right here. When? - What? - Oh, wonderful, honey, congratulations! - What?! - Helen's had a boy. - Oh, that's great! How is she? - D'you hear that? Fine. Both of 'em. I'm gonna see you all soon. Talk to Marcy. She's got some news for you too. Gee! - Hey, Arty! - I'm too young to be a grandfather. Hey, listen, everybody! I got great news. - What is it, what is it? - I just became a grandfather! (people shouting) - No, old grandpops here is bustin' out all over. In fact, listen. (people chattering) - How does it look like? - Just like me with a little mustache. (people chattering) - Can you hear him? (people chattering) (upbeat music) (singing in foreign language) (children singing in foreign language) - We who have survived men's hell on Earth, have gathered here for the first time. And perhaps because of the passing years, the last time. But not to be cheered or worshiped, but to look into each other's eyes and say, "Yes, I know you. I know where you were. I was there too. Yes." And as we know who was there, we also know who is not here tonight. More than six million of our Jewish brothers and sisters. And more. Five million more who were not Jewish. And this gathering is a call to all men and women on this Earth of ours not to run from the new darkness we see around us. To rise against hate and suspicion before they feed on our weaknesses. To extend a hand or take one that needs us. Because we are here for all men and women, our children are here for all children. And they have accepted this legacy for all children to come. Those of us here have come from many places. We have come to celebrate life. Our own, which was spared by the Almighty. - I've just become a grandfather. - And to pray for those whom he took in his wisdom. We may never again meet like this, but this moment will live as long as it is remembered. Remember it, dear friends and children. Nothing dies that is remembered.
