Tretyakov Sound recording system: Tagefon In the capitalist nations... ..factories and businesses are in crisis. To you, Komsomol of the West, on the front lines of the class struggle... ...we dedicate this film. Attention, this is Moscow speaking. We start with a Komsomol radio appeal to the entire Soviet Union. The workers of Moscow notify the party and government. Huge industrial plants have been put into operation. A ball bearing factory, the Stalin Automotive Plant and others. These are all in need of metal. Stalingrad is producing new batches of tractors. They're waiting for high quality metal from Magnitogorsk. "This is Lugansk speaking. We have two new types of steam engine. Our plant is set to go into serial production. Metal production has to be stepped up. To the workers from Magnitogorsk and Kuzba. Comrades, attack the coal. Extract ore, melt iron. The nation needs Soviet cars made of Soviet steel. Respond, Magnitogorsk. Magnitogorsk." On the Siberian steppes, where the nomads roam... ...and the wind bends the grass. 300 million tonnes. 300 million tonnes of high-grade ore... ...will be contributed to the socialist construction by Magnetic Mountain The ore will be transported to the blast furnaces of Magnitogorsk. Drilling brigades are at work on Magnetic Mountain. Off to the ore crushing plant. Steel drums break up the ore. A conveyor belt transports the granules to the blast furnace. For the melting of metal, coke is needed. The boiling crucibles go to the filling machine. The cast-iron bars, material for machine parts... ...are loaded onto wagons. "We will follow the road to socialism through industrialization at full throttle... ...and leave the perennial ‘Russian deprivation' behind us. We will become a nation of automobiles and tractors." -STALIN The construction of the world's first metallurgic giant takes place: The MAGNITOSTROY.

A second blast furnace will be constructed here. The Komsomol concreter brigade from Comrade Galyulin. In accordance with directives from the party and the government... ...the Komsomol of Magnitostroy set out to build a second blast furnace. Good morning. How are you? What did you do yesterday? Mr Gabrieli, the gas exhaust is ready. We're starting on the ventilation grille. Ishmakov's brigade has also finished its work. Yesterday they went through 250 tonnes. But will your brigade manage to finish by the day after tomorrow? We may be able to. -Okay. The bricklaying brigades of Ishmakov and Rostovtsev compete one another.

After being relieved of duty, Ishmakov instructs the young generation of workers. Well done. Push, push, push. Lower, lower, a little lower. Turn off the faucet. Hurry. Try riveting. Push harder. Alongside an iron construction, a wall of bricks rises up. the tool workshop They're making wind heaters... ...by means of which hot air will be blown into the blast furnace. At the Ural River... ...the enthusiastic and heroic workers of Magnitostroy... ...built a one-kilometre-long dike in only 150 days. The Ural reservoir supplies water for the cooling of the blast furnaces. The Komsomol has finished the blast furnace... ...and has once again accomplished a glorious and heroic deed. Two socialist giants are at work here in one and the same breath: Kuzbas for coal and Magnitogorsk for ore. Spare time is sacrificed for the extraction of coal. The mine workers of Prokopyevsk attack the coal strata. Wagons full of coal for Magnitogorsk are on the way. We extend our hands to the world's best transport workers: Kuzbas-Magnitogorsk. Now the coal has to be turned into coke. Where is the crane operator? Why has the work been interrupted? The crane operator is absent again, that's why nothing is happening. The crane operator isn't here. We won't make the deadline. Call Mitchuchin. He knows all about cranes. Call him yourself. He's at the battery unit. Have you seen the secretary? -He went that way. Mitchuchin. The crane operator isn't here. There's no one to operate the crane. Is there no replacement? -No, we haven't found anyone. Okay. The secretary of the Komsomol cell... ...takes the place of the crane operator. The coke is transported to the blast furnace. Not everything is ready yet to put the two furnaces into operation. The Komsomol decides on a nocturnal assault. With the city committee. Do your guys know about Tuesday? Okay, keep standing by. Did you inform the guys? “Yes, no problem. Hello? Komsomol City Committee. One moment. Did you arrange it? -Four cars are going to the site hut. Hello, the cars have already left. Alright. ATTACK! We will fight like devils. "Ural, Ural. town by the Magnetic Mountain Ural, Ural There's lots of iron there The party said: 'Give our country iron.' And the Komsomol responded... ‘We will!
