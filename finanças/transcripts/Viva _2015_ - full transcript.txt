(music plays) (lip-syncing) What's he staring at the whale for? We're grooming him to replace you Celeste. Celeste: I'd like to see him try. Who'd want to dance in this shit hole? It's because we're Cuban. We're born exhibitionists. That's why we make such fabulous whores. Man: Jesus! Sorry. Do me up. I'm on. Some proper men out there. I'm feeling lucky Jesus. Want to see something beautiful? Sure. Welcome to wonderland! (car horn honks) Woman: Jesus! Jesus: I'm doing Nita's hair. Fuck her! Come on give me your keys! I'm getting soaked! Finish me off. I don't want to be here with that whore. She's your granddaughter Nita. What's she want? Nothing. Nothing? She always wants something. Hi Jesus. Stranger. Granddad. Fuck you! Look at her shorts. They're about to disappear up her ass. I don't like seeing you with her. Jesus: I know Nita. Woman: I'm so wet. All down here. Look at that. Listen to me. I told your grandmother... that I'd look out for you. And your poor mother. Nita stop! Even your father. God rest them all. My father's not dead. Nita: Might as well be. I promised them. Did I or didn't I? I told them I'd look after you. I'm not going to sit here and watch her corrupt you. That all you're giving him? Is this your business? He did your hair didn't he? I'm short this week. Things are tight. Whore! You shouldn't put up with her. I need the money. Corrupt you! As if. What are you doing today? You going out? Why? I need the apartment. For who? Javier. Javier? The boxer? He's got prospects. His fists are going to take me to Miami. You'll see. Take him to your place. Half of Havana lives there. Even Nita lives there. Anyway, you're practically family. Jesus, I need to get fucked today. And in a bed for a change. For me? An hour. Two or three. I'm not walking the streets all day. You'll find something to do. I'm broke too. Please. (whistles) Jesus! Hey Don! Your arm? Ah some asshole. I've been fighting down the Malecon. People are crazy down there. How are you? Looking for tourists? Me? I'm looking for tourists. But it's dead today. Can't do nothing like this anyway. They'll think I'm crazy. They'll think you're drunk. I am. Fuck! I've got to go. They've got it in for me. Got any money? None. Same as ever. Pamela! Speak of the queer and he'll appear. - What? - Come on, Mama wants you. Me? Why? My lips are sealed. Pamela! Pamela! - Pamela what's going on? - I don't know. She'll tell you herself. - Celeste ran off with her wigs. - Shit! Pamela: Prepare yourself. It's war here. Woman: You want me to be second to her! Man: Who said that? Woman: Because I'm not a transvestite? I work just as hard! - I've been here longer. - You look down on me. I asked you to cover that's all! You hate me because I don't live as a woman? I don't hate you because you're not a transvestite... and I don't hate you because you dance like a spastic. I hate you because you're a fucking hog! And you're the dirtiest whore in Havana! Please! (all shouting) I'm warning you! Let me go! Fuck you bastards and rats! She could have busted my nose. She nasty. I paid good money for this nose. You only had to do a few shows. Why'd you ask a crazy? Like who? Someone else, someone normal. I don't take shit from anyone Mama. Jesus! My reserve wigs are inside. Can you do them? Sure. Excuse the mess. I had to check to see if Celeste took any dresses too. Did she? No. Just my long hair. I had such beautiful long hair. European. Expensive. Why'd she do it? Who knows? Crazy mulatto whore. And I trusted her. That's my problem. I trust people. What a mess. I hate short wigs. They make my neck look fat. Mama, I'll find some baby drags for you. Do you want me to? Mama? Want me to set up auditions? Do what you want Cindy. Tomorrow? Okay but no more crazy bitches. Would I bring you crazy bitches? Man: Hi. You're back. Sorry! Why? It's your place, right? I'm Javier. Yeah. I know. Cecilia here? She's washing her box. Is that him? Angel Guti√©rrez? Yes. Shit. I saw him fight once. When I was eight. He fought beautifully. I don't remember him much. He left. When I was three. I'd never have guessed you were his son. So good! Come on. Go! We're going down the Malecon. I heard. You got some money you can lend me? I'll pay you back. You never do. All those times I saved you at school. (indistinct chatter) (footsteps approaching) - Next victim? - Me! Wait chicken chops. Why are you here? I want to audition. Why do you want to do this? I don't know. It's strong. It's pretty. Right? I want something for myself Mama. I got nothing for myself. No one. No family. I need the money too. You survive by hairdressing? Yes. I might have to do other stuff too. I don't want to. I might have to. - This isn't a charity. - Yes I know. I can't help everyone. Make what you can from these. Thanks Mama. I'm promising nothing. And you still do my wigs. Okay? Sure. Who were you hoping to look like? Don't know. Rosita Fornes? You look more like Donatella Versace. I can fix my hair myself. That's the least of your problems. Have a name? Godzilla? - Viva. - Mama: Viva? Maybe? Why are you singing this old shit? Show us something. Magic! (up-tempo song plays) (lip-syncing) (quiet chattering) She's a mess. She didn't even tuck properly. They can see her cock from Cienfuegos. How do you think that went? Good. I wouldn't go that far. You were shit. It's not about mouthing the words. - I know. - No you don't. Not with these songs. You have to do them with feeling. They mean something. It was shit. Your wig. Keep it. My head's too big anyway. You're on again Saturday. Really? But practice. Practice, practice, practice. Show us something real. Otherwise we'll get someone else. (up-tempo song resumes) (lip-syncing) (song ends) (grunting) Nita find you? No. She said someone was looking for you. Who? Doing anything today? No. No what? I don't want you fucking in my apartment. Why? I don't like hanging round for hours waiting for you to finish. I thought we were friends? Yes. When it suits you. Fuck you. After all I've done for you stupid faggot! You're jealous. Of who? Of you? Fuck you. No one gives a fuck about you. Asshole. (up-tempo song plays in club) I need a husband. Tired of giving my ass to anyone. Talk to your sister. Anyone special out there? Him at the bar? Cindy: No, he's Cuban. I'm not interested. He's probably from out east and thinks we're real women. I am! I'm 125% real woman. Chicken... you want a look? I don't like looking at the audience. You've got to engage. Give yourself to people. Make them feel special. That's how you earn. It's your job. Go on. Help him with his wallet. Hold still sweetheart. Tuck it away. See? Gone. It's all make believe anyway. You don't have to go with him, just lead him on. Go on, prove yourself. - (song ends) - (audience cheers) Man: Please... Ladies and gentlemen. Show your appreciation for our latest discovery... Viva! (up-tempo song plays) (lip-syncing) Who the fuck do you think you are? - Let me go. - What d'you think you're doing? What do you think you're doing? I know what I'm doing. This how you get your kicks? Beating up faggots? Let me go! He's my son! I know him! I'm your father! Drink. You're shaking. Mama. Are we going on? Yes. There's people out there. - With who? - Cindy. Play something or we'll lose our crowd. You not recognize him? - I never met him. - No? Not since I was a kid. Your mouth's fucked. Cindy get on that stage or I'll fucking kill you. - Just trying to help. - You're rubber necking. Keep your hair on. Nasty. Okay? I'm sorry Mama. For him. I've dealt with meaner. He's a handsome bastard. Drunk too. The way I like them. No, no. Keep your mouth closed. It's cut. When did he disappear? When I was three. And nothing? No. We heard he was in prison. I could have guessed. Turn. He might have killed someone. - Oh? - He killed someone. Who? I don't know. In a brawl. We were told. I don't know him. I never knew him. Why's he back? - Jesus. - What does he want? Probably nothing. Some trouble. Men are crazy. My father was the same. Let me see. That'll hold. You got some glitter! Pretty? Curse of the fighting drag queen! Lazara. You see someone go into my place? I saw nothing. (clattering) (man coughing) (continues coughing) Fuck. Fuck. Is there any coffee? Some. Where? In the cupboard. Are you going to come show me? That wasn't so hard. You having any? Jesus: No. You frightened? I hit you hard. Should I say sorry? You don't recognize me? You're not like your photo. I'm old. Or older. What did you expect? I didn't expect anything. No? Did you wash it? It's okay. It will get infected if you don't clean it. I know. It doesn't look that bad. Last night? What was all that Viva shit? I've not been doing it long. That makes it okay? I don't know. I need the money. Really? Displaying yourself like that? People laughing at you? You won't be doing that anymore! Understand? How did you know I was there? One of your friends. Who? A fiery thing. She's sharp. She'd cut you. Cecilia? Does it matter? To us I suppose. To our new life. Sometimes... when you have rum in your veins, it feels like you can go anywhere. That's the pity. You look like your mother. Why are you here? For how long? I was born here. So was I. So I'm back. This is my home. You got any cigarettes? No. Shit. I should get dressed I suppose. You stay there. (indistinct chatter) He hasn't killed you yet? I'm going to the CDR to have him reported. Don't expect anyone to get their hair done with him there! You told him? Someone would have. - Who? - Fuck you Jesus! You wouldn't let us use the apartment. Tell me why. Mama: He said you can't. I don't care about him. Mama: Well I do. Jesus: Why? Mama: Jesus! Jesus: He won't know. I won't tell him. Please, Mama. - Mama! - I don't want problems. I can't afford to have any trouble. What trouble? I don't need a crazy drunk bringing trouble here! Sorry but business is business. What do I do now then? I can think of a few things. Cindy, shut up. I don't know. Maybe in a few weeks. I don't know. Please. No! I don't want you near the club. You can do my wigs at my house like before. I'd appreciate that. Besides he might go away. He might drink himself to death. Give it time. My father was a nasty bastard too. Jesus: Yeah? Till I hit him with a tire iron. He wasn't so nasty then. (music plays) Angel: You back? Where've you been? Fucking answer me! Nowhere. I gave your mother those records. They were being dumped. Imagine that? We should get along now. Or try to. Agreed? We'll be civil. You show some respect. You okay on the couch? Yes. Will you cut my hair? - What? - You cut hair don't you? Yes. Now? No. In a day or two. Not too short. Yes I know. I want to look respectable. Do something to impress people. I don't normally cut men's hair. Usually old women's'. Make me look like an old woman and I'll kick your ass. Do I look okay? You should shave. Fuck you! I want you with me. What? Tomorrow we'll go down to the boxing club. I want people to know I'm back. I'll get some work down there. Don't want us to starve together. (men shouting indistinctly) Asshole! What? He's swinging wide. He's wide open. He'll be slaughtered. Hey Nestor! You going to let him box like that? Like what? The kid's wide open. Who the fuck are you? You don't remember me? Should I? It's me Nestor, me! I can't see you with the light. Here I am. Fuck me! Back from the dead! Shit Angel. I'm home. Angel Gutierrez! Angel, you're the man! Nando. Look who's here. Coach! You look the same. That's fighting! You don't look the same. I'm so fucking fat. You know my son? Yes, I've seen him around. He's a good kid. I know. (Nestor and Angel continue chattering) - Angel. - What? I've got some regular clients. I do their hair. They're expecting me. Who? Some old women. I promised them. I can buy food on the way home. I don't want you staying out late. - Okay. - Alright then. (indistinct chattering) (music plays) (lip-syncing) I thought Lydia was dead. She retired... to Vinales. Christ! Where's Mama? Waxing her ass. What do I care? Her wigs are inside. They need fixing. She looked like a crack whore last night. You bitches just going to sit there clacking? What do you want? Tell me I'm beautiful. Still here? I've been waiting. I did your wigs. Very good. Thanks. He says it's okay. What? That I can perform. What changed his mind? He doesn't give a fuck about me. He's going away anyway. He has some woman in Santa Clara. Mama! We're going to be late! We've got to go. I know. Alright. We'll try you again on Saturday. One song. If there's any problem from him I'll kill both of you. There won't be. Why is everyone on this island addicted to fucking drama? (upbeat music plays) (lip-syncing) Angel: What's your secret? Javier: Both my hands are good. Cecilia: Javier I'm tired. Javier: Honey. I'm talking, I'm boxing. It's good you came down the club. You can train me. I got the Nationals coming up. I'm gonna win. You don't need me then. Then the Pan-Americans in Mexico. I nearly got there. Javier: Then leave and make money. Run away? Javier: Or what? Stay here and rot? I don't know where: Spain, America... - (interrupts) Javier. - I'm fucking talking here! Women, Angel? I gotta go. There's nothing to eat. Rice and beans. Angel: Prison food! Can't survive on that shit. I was someone like him once. Dumb and happy. Just a flickering moment. Boxing. Then everything fell apart. Then nothing. Then fucking nothing! (incoherent screaming) Angel: You gonna keep saying nothing? What? I'm an asshole? You not having coffee? It's the last of it anyway. No food left either. Did I break many? Sometimes I'm not so good on rum. I've been inside too long. I'm an animal! Where are you going? Do I have to tell you where I'm going now? Ask permission? Why doesn't he get a job? He's hoping to get something at the club. They promised him anything? I don't know. You think they want him hanging about? And pay him for the privilege? I'm short today. I'll give you food instead to keep you going. Thanks. Angel: Nestor, let me show him. Let me spar with him. You think I'm past it? (music plays) (lip-syncing) Dancing? I got us some food. Angel: I was down at the club. Feels like it's going to rain. - Shall we toughen you up? - No. Jesus! Jesus! Jesus! Calm fucking down! (music ends) This is my home! Do they even pay you? What? Are they going to pay you? (thunder rumbles) (car horn honks) These cigarettes are poison. You quiet still? No. Just not talking? Yes. OK. I'm doing my best, you know? All this is new to me. You not eating? You can't cook for shit. People still go up on the roof? Sometimes. Still the most beautiful slum in the world. As a kid, did you ever miss me? No. You were probably better off alone? I knew no different. Just you and your mother? Yes. She never meet anyone else? No man? No. Is that where your dancing comes from? From her. I guess. I have clients again today. Sure. (music plays) You been practicing? Sure. (song stops) Lydia! Get your bony ass out here! We have to practice. You can't rush beauty. You're the one with the father? I suppose. Nasty business. My own. I tried. But we embarrassed each other. Or I embarrassed him? Heaven knows why. He died alone... stupid fucker! - (song resumes) - Cindy: Lydia! Patience. Hey! Your father is fucking crazy. Shouting his mouth off. Demanding money. Cecilia: Leave him Javier. We had to distract the stupid bastard with rum. Fuck you! What? You heard me. (Cecilia shouting) No one wants shit like him around. You hear? Faggot! Walk! Don't you dare. (Angel coughing) You okay? Angel: I've been sick. This rum is rotten. My guts are rotten. They're assholes. You want to clean yourself? I've got no cigarettes. You need to go to bed. Is it hot? This... We used to dance to this. Her and me. I remember. What? Fuck them! Are we all going to drown? We'll be okay. I'm hot. My shoes. I'll take them off. Lift your legs. Jesus? (up-tempo music plays) Get many tips? Not bad. I'm not surprised. You were good. Improving. I almost believed you. He gone yet? No. I'm sorry. For what? I lied to you both. He doesn't know I'm here. Drive him crazy if he did. No Jesus. Can you still work in my house? He doesn't know about that either. What? I won't bother you anymore. How you going to survive? I did before. I'll be fine. Shitty room. Cheap. Sorry. Could I have forty? We agreed a price. I've been more than fair. We can meet again. You planning to do anything with your life? Don't know. You should. You're nice. I hope you stay like that. Mama: Jesus. Mama. Why are you here? To visit you. I've an interest in your welfare. You work for me. Worked. That's what I came to find out. There's still a job for you. He doesn't want to do that shit anymore. So what's he going to live on? Pure air? Or are you providing? This city does terrible things to the idle. So I let him go about parading his weakness? Excuse me? Sure... you think this is weakness? You think I don't fight my own fight? Because I fight my own fight. This is how I fight my fight, asshole! Now here's what I propose. Jesus comes to live at my place. He'll be free to do as he pleases. Perform, whatever. Out of sight out of mind, no? And you can happily drink yourself to death. You want to get your stuff? No. What? I don't want that. Mama: Okay. I did what I could. I tried. Stupid macho fucker! Okay? Yes. (dog barking) (instrumental music plays) She dances beautifully. Sweet with her hips. You like her? Of course. You never liked pussy? Never. Never ever? No. That's hard for me to understand. What do you see when you look at her? The same as you. I doubt that. Would you prefer if I was someone else? What? Someone straight? Stronger? Wouldn't it be easier? I don't know. Jesus. Woman: You want to dance old timer? I'm broke honey - no money. That's okay. I'm feeling generous. I'm feeling lonely. You danced well together. She's a hot thing. You could have brought her home. I could... but I would have woken up scratching. It's true. I could smell it off her. Papa. You don't believe me? No. I don't know. Comrade. Your leg now? No no no... it's fine. The crutch was a gift. It turns out clients love a sad story. Makes them feel like they're helping. Eases their conscience. Who knew? But I'm telling you. With this fucking crutch. I'll be in Barcelona by the end of the year. How are you? Want pizza? Of course I fucking do. I've got to go. Easy money walking. Hey, mister! Hey, hey! Welcome to Havana. (music plays) Angel: Have a drink. You got something you want to say? Maybe. Before I get too drunk. You? Don't know. You hardly ask about my mother. I was in jail when they told me she had died. Sad. I'm sorry. She used to talk about you. What did she say? That you were a lousy bastard. But that you weren't always a lousy bastard. I don't know. I used to beat her. I'm sorry. We loved each other. I did or maybe once. But then... I was fucking crazy. I felt sorry for her. And me? What was I? You were just there. Yes? This little small thing between us. Like a question. An open mouth. Then I left. I had to. Why? To give her some hope. When I was young, I thought I was these. My hands... and my bad skull. My hard bones. And when that ended... I was nothing then. No one. I killed someone. Yes. I know. Terrible. Jesus. I came home because... What? I came... There's a reason they let me out... I'm sick. That's what I wanted to say. What's wrong? My lungs. And under my arms. It's why I've come back. I'm done. You want to come walk with me this afternoon? Where? I don't know. Around. Sure. They gone to Mexico already? I guess. Javier in the Pan-Americans. Pan-American asshole! Ever think of leaving? Not really. You? Hardly thought of anything else. Never even been on a boat. We go? (loud clattering) Angel? (gasping) You okay? (coughing) What name? Angel Gutierrez. He has pneumonia. His lungs are weak. You knew that? Yes. There are tumors. We can only give him palliative care now. We'll keep him until his lungs dry out. Then you can have him back. How long does he have? It's hard to say but not long. Weeks rather than months. I'm sorry. (sobbing) He's settled. Comfortable anyway. Sit down. Thanks. You'll need to bring him food. Yes. That's important. He'll need his strength. Okay. Are you all he has? Yes. He's lucky. You're a good boy. Make sure he eats. Yes. They told me. I reckon he'll sleep the rest of today. Don't let him wallow in bed when he wakes. I'll help when he gets home. I can't pay you now but... Fucking hell! I don't want money. I know. None of us are savages yet. You have to eat. Cigarettes is all I want. You're not allowed. It doesn't make any difference now. Your cooking's better. Nita made it. I might have guessed. Help me. I have to go piss. I don't want to stay here if things get bad. What? If things got worse I'd rather be at home. Okay with you? Yes. Thanks. Hey. Give me a drink? - You okay? - Fine. Good. - I've got to go. - Wait. I'm pregnant. Isn't that stupid? I don't know. It's fucking ordinary. Seven weeks. Maybe eight. - What are you going to do? - Don't know. Keep it... get rid of it. I haven't told Nita yet. She knows anyway. She spent last week staring at my tits. Is Javier happy? Were you born stupid? Why? He doesn't want to know. He says I'm on my own. Asshole. I got to go. (indistinct chattering) Did they say when I'm getting out? The end of the week they think. They think! I don't fucking believe it. Here. You got me those? Yes. I got you those. Come on. You don't want one, right? - Everything okay? - What? We'll be alright? - At home? - Yes. It would be easier if... What? If I could go back to the club. No. It pays well. We could live. I'd rather starve. We'll be okay. (grunting) (distorted music plays) Are you drunk? (music plays normally) (lip-syncing) You like the fat one? She's good. - You avoiding me? - No. You robbed me. Who me? You're mad. Don't I treat you well? Let me go. You whores are all the same! (audience cheering) What are you going to do? I don't know. Sacrificing yourself won't help. I know that. My offer still stands. You can work for me when you want. Is that what you want? Only if he's happy. You still need his permission? It's not that. His blessing? And in the meantime you get devoured? It's none of my business... but I'll give you some advice. In the time you have left, be fully yourself. Otherwise you'll have nothing but regret. (coughing) Jesus: You ok? Quit fucking fussing. Where did the bruise come from? Nowhere. I'm tired. I'm going back performing. I decided. We need money. And it's not just that. I have no say? I don't think so. Explain it to me then. All my life I've been made to feel sorry for who I am. Like I should be ashamed or apologize. Weak. Effeminate. I don't know. Look. And then to just stand there... honest and strong. To sing out. I'd never felt that before. The music. That's all. I'm doing this for me. Well I... I don't want to see it. (door closes) There's coffee. You having any? (music playing) (lip-syncing) It feels like a full moon. Why, you having your period? No but there's an energy. We got trouble! Holy shit. - He's here. - Who? (audience cheers) Stay on the stage. If there's trouble, we'll be here. I'll be fine. No hiding. (music plays) Good luck. Man: ...our sensational new discovery... Viva! (lip-syncing) (song ends) (audience cheers) Viva. (Angel coughing harshly) Want to get a drink? No. I want to go home, I'm beat. Come on. You're in one piece. Just like ground beef, no? He's asleep. Thank you. Angel: On the night you were born, there was a carnival. Yeah? You were born easy. (labored breathing) I remember. I went out dancing all night, and got really drunk in Malecon. I felt like someone. Cecilia was here. Jesus: Yes. I saw her. She drank most of my rum. Look after her. Yes. She and the baby will need you. Let her come live here, after. Sure. You're a good boy. He's ready. Will I go with you? No. I'm good. Go home. Are you sure? Yes. (somber music plays) (lip-syncing) (audience cheers continue) (song ends)
