I hear a ringing echo Maybe the bells of San Marco Maybe the sweet tongue Of your love That calls me I hurry, hurry Dear ladies. Most excellent gentlemen. You will witness the searing love of a noble and beautiful Venetian lady for a proud young stranger, who has just arrived to our city. You will be made aware of the audacity and cunning she'll use to catch him. You'll see the happiness her yearning awakens and how another woman will fall in love with the same man, and how her love will be poisoned by the demons of jealousy. Through the happiness of the one and the unhappiness of the other, you'll realise the fatal power of a woman's love, and how easily we become slaves under love's sweet powers. Listen carefully and don't be shocked that matters usually not spoken of will be brought out into the open by our actors tonight. A word of advice. Remember that love is not all mind, not all heart, and not all... ...but all three of them together. Last piece of advice, but only for you, gentlemen. The ladies may exit. When you give yourself up to love, remember that women are not just for loving and owning, but that they are also lovers, maybe even more cunning, audacious and ardent than you... Beware. Oh dear... God bless this virtuous girl. Many thanks. Please, may I say two words? Apologies for my audaciousness. Your goodness gives me courage. At your service. I'm a nobleman who's come to study the beauty of this land, and to get to know Venice. I'm impressed by the place, but these wonderful, beautiful ladies have impressed me much more. And most of all has your mistress conquered my heart and made me her eternal slave. Please tell her that I'm hers. I beg of you, please commend me to her. I won't pass that on. Your love has to be patient. -I beg you with all my heart. -I'm pressed for time. Shall I tell you something, miss Veleria? Silly girl, that the swallows are here? Better than that, but I won't tell you since you called me "silly". Don't get angry, child. I don't know who said something about you in the street. What are you saying? About me? You're joking. -I won't say anything. -Who is he? -Who spoke to you? -A stranger. Dressed like a nobleman, in a silk jacket and with a rapier. -A young man with black hair? -Black and coiffed. -What did he say? -I didn't listen. -Have you forgotten everything? -I swear by this cross. -Only the last thing. -Say it. He said, "Commend me to the lady." -You're pulling my leg. -Your loss if you don't believe me. -What did you reply? -Nothing. Why so rude? If you meet him again curtsy and say: "My lady thanks you." Have you understood? Yes, my lady. -Nena, were you sleeping? -I was about to. I'm tired. Nena, I'm the fire that consumes me. -What fire? -My body is on fire. I'm dying. -Have you got a fever? -No, the fever's in my heart. We'll send for the doctor tomorrow. -Only one doctor can help me. -A real man. -Only one person. -A big, strong and beautiful man. Only one person. With the face of an angel and a small nose of gold. -He's arrived from Paradise. -All men are men. He's more beautiful than all men in Venice, in the East, in the world... That's because you like him and you've been a widow too long. Like him? He's my god, my happiness, my treasure... Let him come over if you pine for him so. He won't look at me under the veil. He thinks I'm old. And anyway he's in love with that Veleria next door. Is it that beautiful boy? What will you do with that cherub? -Don't you know? -What will you do? Put my arms around him and hold him tight, tight. -And then? -His mouth always ready for kisses. -Not so hard, you're choking me! -I die, I'm soaked with sweat. Dear God in heaven... If only the night would be over, so the morning would come. Morning... What will you do tomorrow? -I want that man. -But how? -With money and gifts. -And someone who can get him here. -With everything you'll tell him. -Try to sleep. If you want me to sleep, put your arms around me. I'll close my eyes and try to imagine that you're the little cherub. -Like this? -Yes, dear child. Do you believe it now? -Please do me a favour. -What? Hold me for a while, and then start swearing like a man. I don't know what to say. Say those dirty words men use to say. -What words? -The words they say at the brothel. Don't you know them? I'll say them if I don't fall asleep. But if I fall asleep I won't say anything at all. My sweet Nena. Please be a bit rude. The night when sweet madness Which invites us to dream The sky of Venice The stars of Venice Look down on us Night of love For the happy lovers The longing to kiss The longing to embrace END OF THE FIRST DAY SECOND DAY All the strange ideas my mistress have at night- I have to procure during the day to please her. I don't know what to do. It's difficult. To bring home the young man in secret. And it mustn't be done by a woman. I'll talk to Bernardo, the carrier. He's experienced, discreet and trusted in the household. Bernardo, what's the hurry? Where are you going? To the inn "Gallipoli" to fill this sack. Wait, I want to talk to you. No time for gossip. We can meet on Sunday. I need to talk now. You'll earn more from this than carrying your sack. It's better to earn money from pleasure than from work... I'll tell you a secret. Come! But you must keep the secret. This mustn't come out. I want you to do me a favour. Don't you know who I am? There's no one in Venice who's more like a priest taking confession. My mistress is in love with a young stranger, Julio. -He's staying at the "Peacock". -She needs some comforting. Bernardo, she's more crazy about him than anyone else. She can't sleep or eat. She just eats the odd egg and some nut cakes. That's love's strategy. First it spares no effort, then it wins the victories of pleasure... Do you know what she wants? Not exactly, but I can imagine... -Do you dare talk to him? -I'd dare talk to the Doge himself! I'm sure. I want you to take him to our house, without him knowing how he got there. If he wants, I'll take him there. Like smuggling goods. What will you tell him? That a lady expects him to come and... ...writes him a letter. Tell him that she wants him to sleep there. Do you what you'll get? Ten ducats. That's not too much for bringing such joy to a house. That's something else than pepper, cinnamon and sugar. You make me laugh. I've got nothing more to say to you. I won't do anything if you don't give me some coins to remind me of the favour I'll be doing you. I don't have any money, but take this ring until my lady pays you. -Take it, but be discreet. -I won't say a word. -I have to go back now. -Wait. Come here. What does he look like? It's a young man without beard. He wears make-up, has black hair, and wears silk. Very elegant. -I know that rascal! -Please talk to him today. I'll take care of it tonight and tell you. Just contact me. My lady is in love with the nobleman and sent me for him. There he is! -Good day, sister. -The same to you. -Have you talked to your mistress? -Yes. Please, give me her reply. She thanks you and sends her regards. What joy! Julio, you're lucky when a lady wants to meet you, her slave. You're not a slave. My body and her rapier are at her service. Let the rapier be. Might your mistress not deign to exchange ten words with her? Then I'd be truly happy. Do you want her husband to kill her? She's married. No, rather kill me than her. I just want to show her that I'm her slave. That's all. I'm sure my lady is content with that. She's very unassuming. I'm in debt to you and will reward you handsomely. -I'll find you a rich husband. -Thank you, sir! Please talk to your mistress about these matters. -My pleasure. -But how will you tell me? Come here at three o'clock. If my lady wants to talk to you, the door will be ajar. If not, please go away without saying anything. I don't know how I will ever be able to deserve your kindness. -I'll be here on time... -At three. Peace be with you. I've been to the "Peacock". I didn't find him. Then I went to the Rialto and San Marco. Didn't find him. The crows must have eaten him. If I wanted to punch him, I'd definitely have found him. O, happy house which hides my mistress. I'll praise you beyond measure alongside this renowned city when I become her lover. Is it him? Coiffed hair, the countenance of an idiot... The devil take it, it's him! My good man, what is the time? -The time? Around ten. -Many thanks. Please don't thank me. I'm here to do you a greater favour than tell you the time. I hope by God it will be to my advantage. Even though I carry a sack I can do this big a favour. -I don't want to be a priest. -No, come over here. I mean a favour worthy of a man of the world. I see. The biggest favour would be to show me a house where I could use my...powers of youth. Those are the ones I'm talking about. I'm talking about what even the birds seek. Please come over here to the side. -What are you telling me? -If you will just trust me, I will take you to paradise tonight. Oh, this face of an angel! This voice of an angel! I'm at your service with everything I own. I'll be your slave! Don't talk. I just want you. -Here I am. -I mean, this afternoon. No, at three I have an important task...with my companions. But before that, I'll go anywhere you like. If you're really looking for happiness, then go to your friends. Don't even look for the devil. -What do you want me to do? -To follow this man. -Where do you want me to go? -Paradise. To visit the holy virgin who is in love with you. -Do you want to know more? -How do I know it's not a trap? Wait, wait, wait... Wait... Look here, the Ghibelline coat of arms. Like yours. -When shall we meet? -Around three. -Should I trust you? -Don't doubt a man of honour. Good. I'm staying at "The Peacock". -I know that better than you. -Good, I'll wait for you there. I'll go and put "the machine" in order. That's funny... Yesterday, I was complaining about my lack of success in Venice. Today, I'm complaining about too much luck. This morning, the maid promised a meeting. Now, that carrier is promising me sweet pleasures. I am without any worries at all. If I don't go to this noble lady, it's shameful. If I don't go with the carrier, I'll be eternally dissatisfied. I'll stick to the carrier. Fact goes before words. One thing is uncertain, one certain. One I have to beg, the other asks me. I'll retire to the inn. A light meal is preferable, so that the warhorse doesn't droop when it's time for the tournament... -Good afternoon. -Good afternoon, Bernardo. -I always come with good news. -Like a true friend. What would you give me for something that will please you? Whatever you want. Apart from the payment, a pair of red socks. -Here's a ducat. Let's hear it. -It's all set up. -Have you spoken to him? -If I have? I've searched for him everywhere, like if he was a pretty girl. What did you say? That I would take him to a place where he could sleep. -What did he reply? -He didn't trust me and won't come. -What did you do then? -I told him who I was. -He'll come? -He'll come. I'll bring the prisoner here at three. I hope you'll take good care of him. Don't say more. -He's good-looking. -He's too beautiful for me. Give me something to drink. Expect me at three. Some dinner... -Whatever you want... -Anything else? Bernardo, my brother. Don't mention this to anyone. I wouldn't even confide in a close relative, if I had one here. Don't think about it. I'll forget everything. If I get some more money. I'll give you new money. Straight from the mint. I hope the little gondola rocks beautifully with you tonight... Fingers crossed. God bless you. It's three. He won't show up. -Were you clear in your message? -Very. Maybe something stopped him from coming. I bet some woman in love wants to sleep with him. Nonsense! My youth looking like an angel. A titbit that you don't find anywhere. And he's a stranger. You can enjoy sweet pleasures with him, and then he'll leave. You won't have to have him around all the time. He won't come. It's almost four. -You should have told him I like him. -I would if you had asked me. -You can't say no to such a youth. -I wouldn't know. Don't you see that you like what's beautiful and eat what's tasty? I understand that. -Some other woman has been luckier. -He'll come tomorrow. -Let's close the gate. -Let's wait a little longer. I'm telling you he won't come. Listen, it's late. Poor me! It's late. Let us go. I hear an echo pealing Maybe the bells of San Marco Maybe the sweet tongue of my love That calls me I hurry, hurry We're there. Jump ashore! I'll manage. -Whose is this beautiful palace? -Don't ask who the sun is. -I won't know more than you tell me. -Then follow me. Good afternoon, noble gentleman. And to our upright Bernardo as well. -We're going this way. -Go in there. This is God's abode. What a richly decorated house. -Didn't I say this was paradise? -Good people deserve this. Here, taste the candy. And drink some. I'm neither hungry or thirsty, but all right. Drink, drink, drink... Dear lady, the nobleman is here. -The most handsome man in the world. -I've already seen him. Should I put this veil on, so he won't see my face? It suits you wonderfully. Hurry up, so he won't be alone. Bernardo is still with him. -Now I'll leave you as a prisoner. -Where are you going? -To the kitchen. -Peace be with you. Bernardo has left. Do you hear that sweet voice? Yes. Now I'll go to him. Close the door and take care of Bernardo. Understood? You don't have to be anxious. The night when sweet madness Invites us to dream The sky of Venice The stars of Venice Are looking down at us The night of love For the happy lovers Good evening, noble master. And a good evening to you, my charming lady. Precious youth. I've longed so for you. I know no higher gift than to keep you prisoner. I owe you great thanks for receiving me as a servant. My virtues are all thanks to you, to your own kindness. My heart. Forgive me for bringing you here in a such a rude way. But the fire of my love consumes me. I burn like a flame. Your virtue and beauty are so great that whatever you do is kind. Please don't apologise. I give you my body and soul. From now on they'll be all yours, not mine. I receive them, precious. And please take mine. I'll take them, my mistress and goddess. I'll be consumed! -Love those who want to love -Kiss those who want to kiss -But in order to love -But in order to kiss You have to be two You have to be two I've just drank some. I don't want any more. Just this. For my love. For your love, I'd drink sulphur. Happy the father and mother who had such a son. They're happy, since they've done something that pleases you. Let me kiss you for those words. Your mouth is sweeter than my lips. -Let me help you with your clothes. -No, I won't allow that. Don't you know you're my sweet son? I'm pleased if you only like me half as much as I like you. My love for you has now awakened. It will grow so great that Venice will see me age. Now your happiness is complete, Angela. Now your love and hope is here. Madonna, now you're my hope, my mistress. I want to look at my son, so that he can't be taken from me. I want to hold him in my arms. My beloved. I thought you would bring me water to put out the fire in my breast, but you've brought firewood and coal to make it more ardent. I came to you a free man. Now, I'm a prisoner. More than chained to this sweet bosom. -You want to kiss my breasts? -I cannot put words on my desire. Tell me what you want. Now stop so I can bite your cheek. -Do you know what your heart said? -What did you ask? -If it was sweet. -Yes, it was sweet. Madonna, you have embraced me. Now let me embrace you. Let us embrace each other. The clock strikes. I thought she was going to wake up. Not a sound from them over there. I know what they're doing. They're putting the sheep in the pen. -What are you saying, you fool? -I'd do the same thing, -if only the mast was stayed. -Shame on you. Didn't you hear the long kisses? He's melting like a caramel in her mouth. I think the Good Lord has sent you to me so that everyone will be happy. The mistress, the youth, you and me are all happy. I go to mass every day and ask the Saviour to remember me. Hush, hush... Maybe he's listened to my prayers. Do you like me a little bit, sweet, darling child? I don't know how else to show it. If you want me to open my chest with this dagger... Tomorrow, you've forgotten my love. Tomorrow... Not even a hundred years after my death. I want you to swear on the Bible. Tell me truth about what I ask. This is where I swear. Do you have a mistress in Venice? A noble lady has taken a fancy to me, but I've never spoken to her. -Where does she live? -On San Barnaba, but I'm not sure. Listen to me. If I knew you touched another woman, I'd die of unhappiness. I want you by myself and give you all my happiness and joy. -I want you to swear. -I swear. And promise. I want all of your body for myself. The mouth, the eyes, the nose, the arms, the legs and everything else. If you only were a perfume bottle. Then I would always carry you between my breasts. You doubt my love. I don't know if it's possible to find someone like you, meant for sweet lovemaking. These eyes promise love, your face pleasure, your mouth sweetness. And your bosom is worth more than gold and silver. -Do you want me to kiss you? -Oh yes. -Are you tired? -Not at all. I'd never tire of what you like to do. -Put your arms around me. -But it's uncomfortable for you. There. I can do with you what I like. END OF THE SECOND DAY THIRD DAY There's no time to just lie here. Those two are still "stirring the polenta". -I'll call them. -Let them be a while longer. Did you hear? It's one o'clock. It's dawning. -It's later than I thought. -I'll call them. Knock slowly. Trust Bernardo. -Were you sleeping, my child? -Just a little bit. I've exhausted myself. Hey! You hardly seem to be there. -Who's that knocking? -Bernardo. It's time to go. Is it light already? You've hardly been here an hour. No excuses, we have to leave! I'll have a look. Dear God, it's already light! Don't worry, I'll soon be on my way. My lovely, beautiful, beloved child. My dearest. Since I've given you my life and my soul, I want you to take this gift for the sake of my love. I've always worn this golden chain between my breasts. Above all, you'll know that you belong to me forever. And that my love demands that you won't touch another woman. Please receive it with the same pure heart that gives it to you. As a payment for this, I only demand a small kiss. If I were to refuse a gift from you, I'd be acting like a dog. I'll take it since that's what you wish. I don't have to remind you of my love for you. Julio is yours, dead or alive. You wanted a kiss... I'm happy, but give me one in return. -Did you hear? -They're kissing again! -Be patient. -All right. -Is the gondola ready? -Yes. If I had been as ready, I would have sifted you like bran. Why so modest? One hears all the time about your feats. That's right. Quiet, here they come! Bernardo, I'm returning your prisoner in good health. Here he is. I'm handing him over to you. Are you now? He can't be that heavy. If he had wings, he'd fly. -Now you have to go. -As you wish. You think I'm taking him to Cyprus. Take good care of my love, Bernardo. I'll make sure the gondola doesn't rock. He takes care of himself. I leave my soul and bring my body. What else do you command? Just one thing. Remember Angela. I'll carry this chain like an eternal memory. Don't forget me. Be happy, and let me remain your faithful servant. Enough of that slobbering! You brought me to break her heart. What's her name? The power of the axe is in the handle... I'll tell you tomorrow. -I don't want to if you don't. -We're off. When love tarries We mourn When love approaches We mourn Love is an illness No doctor can cure Love who wants to love Kiss those who want to kiss But in order to love and kiss You have to be two When love tarries We mourn When love approaches We mourn Love is an illness No doctor can cure Will Julio come? Say it again, dear. Haven't you heard? At three. You should have encouraged him so he doesn't doubt. He said he would come, but I didn't know what to reply. -Good. What's the time? -Past two. -Let's go to the gate. -So soon? You know what they say. "Those with plenty of time can't wait." I don't want to sit there. I'll go back after a while. What do you think? I just want to know that he likes me. Then I'll tell him what to do. Let's go. Oh Venice... Benevolent towards strangers, accommodating towards youths... You've made women of such beauty and charm, that you've completely confused me. Fate is always fickle. Sometimes greedy, sometimes prodigal. It's difficult to satisfy one, two impossible. I don't know where to turn. But it's obvious that the fidelity I first promised, should be kept. I must concentrate on her who has given me her favours. Found me, embraced me, honoured and worshipped me. And now the other lady invites me just to talk! Julio, you've never been rude. Go and talk to her. Feign boredom and say goodbye, cut your ties, leave her... Don't let her stop you. But if she's more beautiful, what shall I do then? She can't be that charming and beautiful... I've decided to go there, and if I get the chance I'll stop her intentions. Then I'll concentrate on my goddess. This time's worse. Then it was safe, now it's dangerous. Without expectations, it proves fantastic. What's already planned will probably be very boring. Unless a particularly charming reception changes my mind. Here in the corner the maid showed me. I go in quickly to see if it's an ambush. How obvious it is when love and confidence is lacking. He doesn't trust me and comes armed. Arms are necessary for a young man, especially for a stranger. The one who never loves need not fear the enemy. If you're not my friend, you're my enemy. That's obvious. Tell me...why didn't you want to come yesterday evening? I was indisposed. It wasn't an opportune time to go out. What love! A little indisposition keeps him at home. That doesn't mean I'm not your slave. -I love you more than myself. -Why do you look at me like that? Your beauty and charm captured me the first time I saw you. -Where did you see me? -In the church, with the nuns. -Didn't you know I was married? -I only thought of your beauty. What do you have under the collar? Let me look. -It's only a small gold chain. -Let me have a look. You can take it if it pleases you. -This chain is from Venice. -I bought it here. My lady, do you know what it looks like? The one that Angela used to carry... -That's the one! -Maybe she sold it? -I understand perfectly... -If you want it, I'll give to you. This chain was a gift! You have come to a conclusion which I don't understand. -So your indisposition was a lie. -It was not! -You mustn't trick me! -Why are you upset? You mustn't make a fool of a poor woman. -I'm not worth less than Angela! -I don't understand... I didn't deserve this. Nothing doing. Angela had greater luck than I. -I'm sorry to have caused trouble. -You did right to come. God is telling me that you don't care and that I shouldn't think of you. -I don't know what to say. -You've gravely offended me. -I'll admit whatever you say. -You can keep Angela. On my honour as nobleman, I don't know Angela. I've never tolerated an offense, and I won't start now! I haven't offended your honour. But justice will be done. The guilty will be punished. -You decide the punishment. -You deserve to be exiled! -But I'm not from here... -You and Angela have killed me! -It seems like it... -The chain proves it. -I don't know what to say. -Leave! And tell Angela that she'll pay for this! I commend myself to your favour. Commend yourself at Angela's! Oh, the devil knows how she could recognise the chain. Oh dear... But the knot has been undone just as I wanted. Now I stand here with only one burden. Two is too much, even for Atlas or...some other athlete. END OF THIRD DAY FOURTH DAY I wish my master... a reasonably long life. Oh, Bernardo... Welcome, brother. What good tidings do you bring? It's time to think of the song from the day before yesterday. Oh. Do you come from your mistress and my lady? I don't know. Isn't it enough that it's because of the song? -You're very welcome... -You understood me. Perfectly. Come with me to someone who can stroke you better than Bernardo. Another man is with Master Julio. Poor me, I don't know what to do. I'm ashamed. What are you doing here? -Looking for a spoon to your soup? -Mind your own business. I won't have anything to do with a carrier. If you go over there, you'll find an accommodating person. Master Julio? -Please listen to me. -Sorry, I didn't recognise you. -What do you want with me? -Lady Veleria is so unhappy. She's crying and says that she's half-dead. You have to comfort her, otherwise she'll die of grief. Please come, dear Master Julio. For your own well-being, and hers. It pains me terribly that I'm unable to aid her in her anguish. What do you mean? Just a short while... Only you can make her well again. I don't want to. She's choleric and it will hurt her to see me. You must talk to her. She'll die if she doesn't make peace with you. Give me your hand, and I'll make peace with her in your name. She wants your hand. And then, if you want me to say it, for each nasty word to you, she wants to kiss you many times. -You want me to come? -Yes please, dear Master Julio. -At what time? -Same time as that unfortunate day. All right, you can expect me. And commend me to your lady until I come. Yes indeed... I'm once again on the road of misery. My opportunities come in pairs and create trouble for me. Just look at the maid and the carrier... I'll tell the carrier I won't follow him in the gondola unless he reveals the name of his mistress. He'll refuse. I'll take my leave of him and go to Veleria to "change the lining". What are you doing? Didn't you hear me whistling? Bernardo! Sorry, are you already back? -It's time to leave. -Good. Before we go, tell me the name of the lady and where she lives. I don't want to run around and pretend to look for her house. What's this nonsense? I don't know and wouldn't tell you if I did. If you won't tell me, I won't come along. Are you mad? Don't you know where I'm taking you? I know, but I want to know more. I see that the horse is tired since it's so obstinate. Tired? Or in heat. -It's sad when roses droop... -I've made up my mind. I understand. You'll wait until tomorrow. Tell your mistress that I won't come unless I learn her name. I'll tell her. And you will never know unless she wants it. Good. Go and talk to her. Don't think I'll wait until tomorrow. I'm going now. The plan succeeded. To Oria. Don't tarry, Julio. Time flies. What would you give if those steps were Master Julio? Do you know what I'd pay? As much as this ring on my finger. -Quiet, it's him. -If only you were a fortune-teller. I'd like you more than my sister. Yes, it's him. Please be quiet and listen. It's him, isn't it? -Master Julio? -Who's there? By coming so soon, I'm now in high favour with the lady. I'm pleased for you. I know what I have won. A body and a soul, which had been lost if you hadn't come. I only want your favours and to be your servant. No, you are my master. You caused me sorrow, since I wanted to be independent. From now on, I'll obey you in everything. Don't say that. I don't deserve it. My lady, now it's time for Julio to make peace with you. Master Julio, why were you so cruel? Cruel to you? Heavens, it was the opposite. I want to be very kind towards my goddess. That's all I dare hope for. If that's the case, I want you to be mine. And that you forgive me for angering you the other day. Forgive me if I have caused you anguish. Now I'm all yours to turn each sorrow into joy. What beautiful little words! Master Julio, they say it's foolish to speak like that out in the open. The winds have eyes and ears. Come inside, so I get the pleasure of seeing you in the light. My lady, do you want to make peace so soon? I can read this peace in your face, which bound me the first time I saw it. Oria, close the door and go to my husband. Tell him to stay quiet. If he asks for me, tell him I'm not well. I forbid him to come to me tonight to bore me. Oria will take care of everything, quickly and thoroughly. The Milanese The Milanese He's a funny one With rapier and plume And with his charming looks He thinks he easily captures The women The women Every beautiful girl Every other lonely widow Do you know something? The one who gets stuck in the bird trap like a small bird Yes, that's the Milanese Yes, that's the Milanese The Venetian lady is sweet The Venetian lady is cunning The Venetian lady is hot-headed The lover becomes his own prey And the lover becomes his own prey.
