Subtitles by explosiveskull (THEME MUSIC PLAYING) JOHN (V.O.): How did I see it, when nobody else did? I don't know. How did that guy invent the light bulb? Sometimes, it just comes to you. Whatever it was, I saw an untapped market... and, well... I tapped it. And it was all going so great. And then, of course, like everything else in my life... it all went to shit. Hm... Tide comes in... tide goes out. Look, I've done some shitty things in my life. But this... I don't think it's one of them. Well, let me back it up a bit, though. I'm a bookie, well, if you're from the IRS, I hang sheetrock. But, you know, if you're looking to put action... on a game, I'm your guy. The difference between me and a Las Vegas casino... is that in Vegas, you gotta pay before you bet. But with me, you bet on credit... which means there's a certain code of honor. And when people disrespect that code, well... sometimes I gotta make consequences for that shit. (DOG BARKS) - (DOG BARKS) - Oh... There you go. JOHN (V.O.): When two teams play each other... I have to set what's called the line. The line is this, how many points do I think... Team A will beat Team B by, so that the bet... is as fairly balanced as possible... and that's what I want, because I make my money off the vig. Now the vig is basically a tax on each bet... for services rendered. I assume the risk and ten percent is my reward. Now, this business model works assuming you get paid. (DOG GROWLING) Sometimes though, I have to improvise. (MUSIC PLAYING) This is my office. This is my secretary. - Hey-oh! - Hey, you! Thank you, Beaches. You mind backin' up these fine gentlemen for me, as well. - Guys! - Hey, all right! Tha' man. Here's your mail. JOHN (V.O.): In these envelopes, well, they're my cash flow... That's all of it? Well, not a lot of guys came through this week. Well, maybe if you were a little more cordial to people... Maybe if you go fuck yourself. Okay, maybe not. There you go. JOHN (V.O.): If I collect more envelopes than I hand out... then I had a good week. Snips, what's the good word? All right, Alphons. JOHN (V.O.): There are a few different types of gamblers. You have your average gambler, consistent guy bets every week. Your sparse gambler, calls every so often... when he gets the bug or maybe someone gives him a tip. Then you have your whale, he bets big. Always pays on time and if you keep him around long enough... you can make enough money on the vig to buy a new truck... in the off season. Another good week, Mickey. Tell me you're not giving all my hard-earned money... to these dirt bags. You kidding? The only reason I hang out with them... is because they're lousy poker players. JOHN (V.O.): For every whale... Steve, how'd you do last night? I got screwed. JOHN (V.O.): There's at least ten hard-luck cases. Look, Maryland's down by 12, they're getting ten. There's no time left on the clock. The scrubs are in. All they got to do is run out the clock, right? Hold the ball. Bench-warming cocksucker shoots a meaningless three ball. They lose by nine, backdoor cover... they fucked me! I'll tell you what, I'm gonna let you slide... on that bet last night. But next time you hit a backdoor cover on me... I don't want to see you coming in here and gloatin'... in front of everybody, all right? I would never. JOHN (V.O.): Look, I'll be honest, I don't mind the hard luck cases. What I can't put up with are the dirt bag motherfuckers... who don't pay up and walk around town... like they don't owe you money. Adam Kramer. Hey, what's going on? - How are you? - I'm great, how you doing? Good. New TV? Huh? Yeah, this is uh, brand-new for Mark Rigney... who said, "These suckers are flying off the shelves... "will you grab me one before they're all gone?" And I said, "You betcha, bud." So I bought this for Mark Rigney and he'll pay me back. - Need a hand? - Yeah. No, I'm good, I'm good. I got it, I got it. - Not a problem. - I appreciate that, thank you. - Thank you. - Wow. - I know. - What kind of TV is that? Uh, 55-inch, picture-in-picture, 1080i, LED. - Curved screen. - Curved screen. Huh, here, let me give you a hand. Okay, thanks. It's just that the door... - Can you wiggle it? There. - There you go. - Thanks. - All you gotta do is lean it. I know, so, just wiggle it... a bit. Oh, oh, careful. - All right, there you go. - Okay, thanks. - You got it? - Yeah. Tell Mark I said enjoy his new TV, huh? I'll have an envelope for you by the end of the week. I'll leave it at Joanne's. - All right, see ya', Kramer. - (ENGINE STARTS) (MUSIC PLAYING) JOHN (V.O.): When half the town owes you money... nobody's happy to see you. Well, guess what, motherfuckers? I ain't happy to see you either, but you got my money. I got mouths to feed. Oh, finally. Where you been? I got hung up. Here you go. Ah, thanks. Aw, god, they've got the onions in it... - What? - Onions, it's got onions. Oh, maybe I got yours, hang on. Aw, fuck me, man! Did you check before you left? You always gotta check, they fuck up. What do you want me to say, Dad? - You want me to take it back? - No, I'm starving, leave it. - You sure? - Yeah, I'm sure. Where are the groceries? I didn't have time. I'll get them tomorrow. Smokes? Here, take mine. - Only five in here. - Let me see. Four, make them last. I'm almost out of beer. Duly noted, anything else? Yeah, as a matter of fact, my TV is acting up. Oh, why don't I go out and get you one of those... new, curved screen ones, you want that? You asked, so I told you. I got to run. You just got here. Yeah, well it's almost an hour before tip off... and I got shit to do. How's the action? Sparse. How much money you still got out from football. A lot. I don't... I don't want to fucking hear it... because you didn't have to deal with the internet like I do. You offer something the internet can't, the human connection. Well, it's not like a lot of people are trying... to do right by me right now. Well, you've gotta convince them. Dad, if I go around breaking fingers... no one's gonna bet through me. You don't have to break fingers. You just gotta be more firm. - Okay, I got it. - You're too soft, you let peopl... I got it, thanks for the advice. - What are you going to do? - I apprec... Show your face around town... guilt people into paying you back? - Do you want your book back? - No. All right, then don't fucking worry about it. - God dang! - Jesus Christ. JOHN (V.O.): Some dads leave their son's a family business. My dad, he left me a book full of degenerate gamblers. This time of year, with no football... and basketball winding down. I become a little more... vulnerable. One big bet can be more costly than a fucking divorce. Let's see, I got Philly plus five, $194. Brooklyn minus seven. $200. Okay. Yup. Philly for ten. You mean a grand, right? Oh, you mean ten grand. Um, yeah. Hang on a second thing. JOHN (V.O.): I can't afford to lose my whale. I know I can take him over the long haul... but when funds are low and he wants to bet big... shit. Mick, you still there? Yeah, I can take five. No, Mick, you don't want to do that. You bet online, you gotta pay taxes on that shit. No, Mick, I know you always pay. Okay, alright, 10 grand on Philly. Good luck. (WHISTLES) He wants Philly. Fuck it, Cornwall never plays defense. Cornwall picks this game to start playing defense. How much you in for? - My Lexus. - SCOTTY: Damn. JOHN: I need income, Scotty. - How's your union card? - Up to date. Want to hang some sheet rock? Do I want to or will I? Petey, give me a beer. You know what, knock these guys up too, will ya'? Big spender. Cheers. - You don't want it? - Nope. - A free drink. - I know that. What's going on over there? He says he don't want it. What do you mean, he don't want it? He don't want the drink. Hey, John, what's the matter with you, take the drink. Thanks, but no thanks. You're embarrassing me in front of my friend, Zibs. Just take a drink. I don't want it. I know I owe you money, I'm gonna pay you. I don't see why you can't accept my drink. When you pay me and we're all square... then you can buy me a drink, how about that? I don't see what the difference two bucks makes, man. Andy, he doesn't want the drink. Hey, Scotty, shut the fuck up, I'm not talking to you. Hey, hey, guys, just calm it down, all right? I'll take it. No, you're not taking a drink, buy your own fucking drink. Take the drink. You bought a truck. Yeah, yeah, the old one was falling apart. It's a brand-new truck. Johnny, I'm a contractor. How am I supposed to work without a new truck? If I can't work, I can't pay you. And I got a good deal. What are you, my accountant? No, I just don't want your fucking drink. Fine. Fine. You know what, don't take my fucking drink. Whoa! Fuck. I'm leaving, I'm leaving, I know. I know. I know. You should have taken the fucking drink, douche bag. It was as simple as that. I was trying to be a nice guy. Fuck off! Zibs, I'm sorry, man, you all right? Aw, that guy is such a dick, I'm sorry, man. Yeah... shit. Listen, I wanted to talk to you about something, anyway. Um, I was wondering if maybe you could... uh, maybe not come in here for awhile. I get punched in the face... and you're kicking me out of the bar? No, it's just that I got a kid, you know... and everyone in town owes you money... and you know, everyone knows you come in here... and if they're avoiding you... then they ain't coming in here, you know. Fuck you, Petey. No, let me buy you a round, okay? JOHN: I don't want your fucking drinks, neither. That's ten grand. It's only money. Tide comes in, tide goes out. Is that Debbie Houston? Yeah, she works here. We messed around in high school. You know she married Hooper? Had a kid together. Just got divorced a little while back. Man, she used to party, man. Shit, looks like she still does. Is that John Zbikowski? And fucking Scotty? I haven't seen you since high school. Do you remember me, Debbie Houston? We fucked, you better. - Buy me a drink. - Fine. Wally, three whiskey shots, right here. So what are you two up to? You were really good at baseball, right? Yeah, I was okay. - Weren't you drafted? - Yup. What happened? I had this thing with my arm. No, to your face? Oh, I got punched. I can see that, why? Somebody owed me money. Somebody owed you money and you got punched in the face? Yep. I'd love to owe you money. Get in line. To owing you money. Time really did a number on us, didn't it? Would you still fuck me? - Hey. - Hey. Hey, you know if you have any coffee? Nope. Nope, you don't have any coffee... or nope, you don't know if you have any coffee? Nope, I don't know if we have any. All right, fair enough. Are you friends with my mom? We went to high school together. Oh. - You know where she is? - Work. She just leaves you by yourself? My grandmom comes over sometimes. Is this one of those times? Are you allowed to stay home by herself? I think so. - How old are you? - 12. That's a gray area. Can we call her? When she's at work I can only call her if it's an emergency. Just an emergency? Only if I'm bleeding. Shit, man. All right, look, okay, I'm gonna be honest with you. I have no idea if I told your mom that I was gonna watch... you or not, so what do you think we should do here? So what? You go to school? - Yep. - Good. Well, we're done for the summer. Oh right, yeah. What are you gonna do with yourself? I don't know. Might want to figure that out before school starts back up. Yeah, I play baseball. - At Dundalk? - Yep. You any good? I'm gonna play pro one day. Settin' the bar pretty high. (MUSIC PLAYING) Say hi to my friend real quick, okay? I'll be right back. Okay. Hey, if you see anyone pull up out here, you honk the horn, okay? Okay. (MUSIC CONTINUES) Thanks for breakfast. Hey, kid, do you want this TV? You sure you don't want this? You hold onto it for me. Think of it as hush money. What does that mean? It means you gotta promise not to tell anyone how we got this. Can you do that? Sure. Promise me you are not going to tell your friends. - I promise. - Okay, good. What should I tell my mom? Tell her I got a new one and gave you my old one. But this is a brand-new TV. Kid, do you want the TV or not? - I want it. - All right. Then figure something out, just don't tell her we stole it. I got a game tomorrow at 5:00, if you want to come. At Dundalk. Yep. Coach is gonna let me pitch. Hmm. You ever pitched before? Not in a real game. Yeah, I'll be there, later. BRIAN: See ya'. (ENGINE STARTING) (CRASHING) (ENGINE STARTING) JOHN (V.O.): Kids are basically hard-luck cases. They're on the take 24/7. You do something nice for them, like... give the kid a brand-new TV. Instead of a thank you... it's can you come to my baseball game? (COUGHING) Sometimes I think about what it would be like... to be free of hard-luck cases. To only have one mouth to feed. BOB: Did you get my smokes? Yeah, I got 'em. (SPECTATORS CHEERING) COACH: Look alive, outfield! Come on now. (SPECTATORS YELLING) MAN: Come on, Frankie, what are you doing out there? Pay attention! JOHN (V.O.): Parents, they see their kids with rose-colored glasses. They think they're much better than they actually are. Zibs? John Zbikowski? It's me, Matt Smith, Smitty? - From like forever ago? - Smitty, how are you? Wow, it really literally has been forever. What have you been up to? - You know, just getting along. - Oh, that's great, that's great. You used to play pro ball, didn't you? - Yep. - For the... - Atlanta. - Atlanta... oh, wow, that's amazing. You got a kid in the league? No, no kids. Yeah, I figured. I would have recognized your name from the roster sheet. Roster sheet? Yeah, we send out roster sheets to all the parents... got a list of all the kids' names. It's always fun to go through it, figure out, you know... which parents you know from school, catch up. Plus, I am the league commissioner this year, so... Really? Maybe we could do something about that scoreboard. Well, I am running for city council, so, uh... if I'm elected, maybe I could do something about that. If you still living in the city, you should vote for me. I don't vote. MATT: Really? Everyone should vote. - Okay, you convinced me. - Great! MATT: Oh, hey, honey, honey... come here, there's somebody I want you to meet! This... - Here you go. - Thank you. Is John Zbikowski, Zibs, best baseball player I ever saw. - Hello? - Hi. He got drafted into the pros. Whoa, that's fantastic! His dad was really something, he used to make you throw... what, like 100 pitches a day or something? JOHN: Something like that. Can you imagine me making Mikey throw 100 pitches a day. He would run away from home. - And call child services. - Yeah. Oh, I can still hear your dad yelling from the stands. - Put it in the glove! - Yeah. I never got who you're out here to see. Brian Houston. Debbie's boy. You remember Debbie from high school? Yeah, you know her? No, just, um, I recognize her name from the roster sheet. Well, enjoy the game. If you ever want to come out and give the boys... some pointers, that'd be great. I don't play baseball anymore. Right, well, we'll see you around the park. (SPECTATORS YELLING) I threw strikes in practice. I'm sure you did. That's probably my last shot at pitching. Eh, there's more to life than playing baseball. I was a pitcher. I got my name on the wall out there and look at me now. You're on the Wall of Fame? I want to be on that wall more than anything. I think you gotta throw strikes to get on that wall, kid. Hey, I can give you some pointers, you know... if you're interested. - Seriously? - Sure. Need a ride? Come on. - Thanks for the ride. - Yup. Hey, kid... you got one of them roster sheets? So you know all these players pretty well. Sure. All right, tomorrow, Eagle-Spartans, who wins? Eagles easily, Ryan Hosfeld is pitching. And the Spartans aren't very good? Not really. All right, how many runs you think they'll win by? Well, they played earlier this season and they won by four... but that was without Hosfeld on the mound. So maybe six or seven. - Yup. Why? - All right. Honey, where are you? Come give Mommy a kiss before she has to go to her other job. Why the fuck are you in my house? John came to see my game today. Give me a ride home. Yeah, okay, fine, I can't deal with this right now, I'm late. Go wash up for supper. What's going on here? What, it's like the kid said. Do I have to call the cops? No, why would you call the cops? Because you're an adult alone with a child... and somehow there's a new TV in my house. Well, I had an extra TV, yours was shit. Isn't that sweet? You know, the kid asked me to come see his game. I gave him a ride home, what's the big deal? That's so nice. Do you give all the kids rides home or just the cute ones? Oh, for Fuck's sake, no! I told him I'd help him pitch. Remember, I was good at baseball in high school. Look, if this is something else, I'm gonna find some dude... some big motherfucker to pin you down and fuck you... right in your ass, some dude with a giant cock. - We're clear? - Yeah, Christ... we're fucking clear, man. What are you guys talking about? Just some grown-up stuff, honey. JOHN (V.O.): How did that guy come up with the light bulb? I'm not sure, I'll bet he was walking around... in the dark looking for something. You know, probably came out of necessity. Hey, you remember Matt Smith. - You mean Smitty? - Yeah. Yeah, he's got his face on those election posters. He's running for... - City council. - Yeah. Yeah, so I see him over at Dundalk Field, right? And he's got this great job and this hot-ass wife. I don't know, man, I just fucking hate him for it. Yeah, fuck him. Anyway, I see all these parents there... and they're really into the games... and I noticed a lot of these parents... are parents who bet through me and I'm thinking... why not put some lines out? You're gonna take bets on little league games. Yeah, people are gonna settle up with me... because they're gonna want to put action on their kids' games. I don't know. It's like opening a horse track in our backyards. Yeah, but it feels just wrong. Scotty, just think about it for a second... what's the worst thing a person can do? Murder someone? Bet with their hearts. I got a whole stable of betters who will bet on their kids... regardless of what I set the lines at. Plus, the internet can't touch me. So you really think people are gonna want to bet... on little league baseball games? I got Boston plus five, $192. OKC plus three, $186. Okay. Hey, uh, you got a kid at Dundalk right now? Yeah, I've got that line, if you want it. Eagles are minus six. Yeah, Hosfeld's on the mound. Hey, I know it's high, man, but the kid can pitch. You want the Spartans? All right. Gotcha, Gordy, duly noted. JOHN (V.O.): Handicapping kids games ain't hard. Big kids beat up little kids. You find the team with the bigger kid on the mound... that's typically your favorite. If his dad is coaching, well... that's a good sign he can play, as well. And if his old man is watching every pitch... like it's game seven of the World Series... Come on, keep your shoulder in there, over the top! JOHN (V.O.): That's an even bigger indication... that the kid is practicing fundamentals at home. Fundamentals and mechanics, they're the great equalizers. Balance, rotation, arm angle, tempo, smooth first step. That shit can be taught and they can give you an advantage. It's usually that simple. Now some people will try to complicate things... find some deeper trends that they think can sway games. You know Richie Porter... now I heard that their family dog died last week... and he can't get over it. - Is that so? - Yeah. And their best players, the Santoro twins? I heard the parents are getting a divorce... and they just told them about it. JOHN (V.O.): It's usually because they don't understand the beautiful... simplicity and purity of baseball. Whoo-hoo! Christmas came early. A lot of guys came through this week to drop off envelopes. A bunch of them I haven't seen in months. Snips, what do you say, buddy? There you go. It's all there. Buy you a beer? No, I got to run. You got them Dundalk lines yet? Yeah, I'll take a beer. We don't tell beer, sir. Oh, well, uh, give me a Coke. Okay, one Coke coming right up. - Zibs. - Smitty. It's a pretty good turnout, wouldn't you say? - Most definitely. - It's funny... I don't recognize half the people here. I just ran into Adam Kramer. I didn't know the guy's got kids. He doesn't. (SPECTATORS CHEERING) You can look around this place... and tell who's got money on the game. Strike three! What the fuck, blue? Get your fucking glasses checked, you fucking asshole. How much does he have on the game? Nothing... just an asshole. Strike! So Andy Fox comes in to Jolyn's today, pays me, in full. Wow. I guess your face really taught his fist a lesson, huh? Here's the thing, though. Now he wants action on today's game. Sure he does, his boy is pitching. He didn't want to bet on his boy. He wants to bet on the other team. You told him to go fuck himself, right? No. I told him, "Duly noted, Andy." You crazy? He's gonna throw the game. I know that. Hey, yo, time. Come here, give me the ball, give me the ball. You're not listening. Give me the ball. (SPECTATORS YELLING) ANDY: Come on, little man, we all play on this team. You throw it like you're in control, you know, you got it? My biggest worry was parents throwing games. I gave Andy the rope, let him hang himself. Make an example out of him. (MUSIC PLAYING) JOHN (V.O.): In any new business venture... there's gonna be a couple bumps in the road... but in the end, the market has a way of correcting itself. Business was good, better than a few of my football seasons. Hello? Hey... I had to bring Stevie on, help me answer the phones. - Hey, Grundy, what's happening? - Of course, I got a line on it. No, I'm lousy, my fucking ear is like a piece of shit. Yeah, I got the lines. I'm looking at the Eagles minus three. - The over-under's 11. - Yeah, 11. You want the money line, it's minus $150? So the Eagles, for a nickel, right? Don't fucking take it then, I don't give a shit. Hey Grundy, don't be such a prick. JOHN (V.O.): Even had to buy an extra shoe box... to store all the money I was making. Strike three! What was that, man? Hey, relax! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey, Mike, Gordy, Gordy, Mike! Sit down, Gordy. There are children present, for Christ's sake. JOHN (V.O.): I had the whole town on board. Well, the whole town except for this fucking guy. That's it, great game today, okay, guys? Great dedication. Maybe we can all do a little base running. You're moving the hands in, Knights on three. - One, two, three. - Knights! Practice Tuesday, I want nobody sleeping in, that's you, 25. Russ, can I talk to you for a minute? What's up? I wanna talk to you about Brian. Yeah, good kid. Kind of hoping you'd let him take the bump again. Yeah, that's not gonna happen. Look, I've been working with him, okay? Look, as a coach, I feel a certain responsibility... to protect these kids against embarrassing themselves. Yeah, but the kid wants to pitch. Yeah, and I want to bang Pat Creadon's mom... okay, it's just not realistic. How much? How much would I pay? Dude, how much to let him pitch? Look, I know you're taking money on the games... and I don't want any part of nothing you're throwing. Hey, I heard what those people did to Andy Fox's truck, okay? It's on the level, I promise. Come on, just give me a number. - $500. - Fuck you. $450. - $150. - $400. $150 plus $15 for every inning the kid pitches. $20. All right. All right, we got the bears next week. He's got the bump. Thanks. See what you got. That was terrible. Your mechanics are shit. Who taught you how to throw a ball? All right, here's what I want you to do. I want you to take your lead elbow, you aim it at the plate. - Like this? - No, like that. There you go, all right? That's your pointer, you do everything else right... the ball is gonna go where that aims. Okay? Now this is important, look at me. First batter you face, I want you to throw it at him. You want me to hit a kid. - Naw, he'll get out of the way. - What if he doesn't? That's why you wear helmets. Look, this is your plate, okay? You own it. You brush that first kid back a little. You're gonna send a message to the rest of the team... not to get too close. Then you're gonna be inside their heads... and that's the most important part of pitching. More important than throwing? Let's just say "yes". Give me the ball. All right? Right there. That's how I want you to hold it, okay? That's your grip, all right? Your arm angle, it's kind of like you're throwing a football. - Like this? - There you go, that's right. When you follow through, flick it with your wrist. Isn't that a curveball? Yeah, man, it's your bread and butter. But I'm 12, I'm not supposed to throw curve balls. Who told you that? Everyone tells kids that, it'll mess up your arm. Oh, my god, all right, here's the harsh truth. You're never going to play professional baseball. Wait, look, here's the good news... neither is anyone else in this league. - Not even Ryan Hosfeld? - No, not even Ryan Hosfeld. You know, and another hard truth, next year you turn 13... they're gonna move you to the big field. Now you can barely get that ball over now. What do you think the odds are you get it over next year? - Not good? - That's right, not good. If you want to pitch, you gotta throw the curve, kid. I hold it like this? What are you doing, practicing sitting on the bench? - What was that about? - Nothing. Didn't look like nothing to me. That's Brett and Abe, they're on my team, they're dicks. You know what you gotta do, you gotta shut them up. No, I'm not worried about it. - What are you afraid of? - Getting my teeth kicked in? All right, first of all, they're your baby teeth. - But... - Okay? You're gonna get... a whole, new set of teeth, you're playing with house money. But these are my adult teeth. - Really? - Yeah. And I don't want to get punched in the face. Look at me, I got punched in the face, I'm fine. He's 12 years old, how hard can he hit? I don't want to find out and I don't want to get in trouble. You're not gonna get in trouble. Look, here's the things that grownups never tell you, okay? Right now, you're a minor. You can get into as much trouble as you want. When you turn 18, it all goes away. - Really? - Yeah, man. I mean, don't go burning houses down and shit... but fighting and stuff, it's forgivable. I don't know. Look at me. Punch his mouth open. - What? - Just hit him, man, lock him up. I'll break it up before he gets a shot in on you, okay? I don't know. Trust me, all right. They will know that messing with Brian Houston... comes with consequences. Go get 'em, man. You're not coming with me? What's it gonna look like if I walk over there... and watch you punch a 12 year old in the face? Oh. Now go, come on. Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait, come here. - What? - How are you going to punch him? I don't know. Let me see you throw a punch. That's not gonna work. Come on, get it, give it to me. Gotta use your waist, your hips... - My hips? - Legs, wham, like that. - Like... - Put your body into it. There you go, killer, come on. Come on! Knock him on his ass, buddy, go get him. Oh, shit! (LAUGHING) (TV BLARING) Ay-yo! Beaches, how you doing today? Just peachy. Give us a couple cold ones, fancy stuff, please. I'm pitching today. That's cool. Back the rest of these fine gentlemen up... for me as well, would ya? What, everybody's pitching today? BEACHES: Hey, hey, hey! Get your cold beer here! Hey, guys, this is Brian, kid's taking the bump today. - STEVE: Ah... - LARRY: How are ya', kid? That's Steve and Larry. - That's Snips. - Hi, Snips. Hey. He talks funny. Snips had a stroke a few years back. He's all there, he just can't communicate. What's a stroke? It's a brain thing, one day you're fine... the next, you're speaking with your hands. - (PHONE VIBRATES) - Can I have a stroke? Sure, you can. What's he doing? That's Alphons, he's taking bets on horses. You want to bet on a race? - Sure. - Alphons, throw me a book. All right, pick a horse. How do I do that? It's complicated, so just go with your favorite name for now. This one... Paid in Full. My kind of horse. Go ahead and tell Alphons, say... "I want 10 bucks on Paid in Full." - Cool? - Mm-hm. Ten bucks on Paid in Full, please. Alphons, kid's with me, he's good for it. SCOTTY (OVER VOICEMAIL): Yo, man, I'm at the site. Where you at? RACE ANNOUNCER (OVER TV): Just Kidding, Paid in Full... Paid in Full, Just Kidding, nose and nose, 100 yards to go. And Just Kidding wins it... - Oh, that was close. - We almost won. Yup... now you gotta pay Alphons, though. I don't have any money. You made a bet without any money. Now Alphons is gonna have to take you out back... and break your legs. I'll spot you the $10. Be tough for you to pitch with broken legs. Now you owe me 10 bucks. How you gonna pay me back, you got a job or something? No. You can owe me. Don't let me see you around town spending money, you got it? - You won't. - All right. - Cheers. - Cheers. One, two, three, break! Get out there, let's go! (ALL YELLING) JOHN (V.O.): You know what? Kid wasn't half bad. I'm not saying he's the second coming of Greg Maddux... or nothing, but he found his aim. Brushed some kids off the plate. (MUSIC PLAYING) (SPECTATORS CLAPPING) His mechanics... they weren't shit. He even used that curve ball we worked on. He went the full six innings, only gave up a handful of runs. Which is pretty damn good for a kid on the smaller side of 12. Would he have finished the game if his coach didn't have... a vested interest in leaving him in, who the hell knows. But he got the W... and maybe earned a little respect in the process. - Great game. - Yup. Kid pitched well, you were right. - Sure did. - Yup. So... It's, uh... good doing business with you. (MUSIC CONTINUES) - JOHN: Good stuff, buddy. - BRIAN: Yeah. - See you later. - See ya'. Good job, buddy. Mom, you should have seen me pitch! I did great. - We won! - That's so good, honey. Hey, hold on a second. What's up? You're a fucking asshole, that's what's up. What I do now. I don't want you hanging out with him. He's not your kid. Okay? He's my kid! Whoa, slow down, all right? I know that. - Do you? - Yeah. I hear you're taking bets on kids' games. Who told you that, man? A little birdie. Yeah, well, that little birdie's making shit up. You fucking lie to me and I will call the cops. All right, fine, I'm taking bets on games... but it's got nothing to do with your son. You expect me to believe that. Hey look, I got a lot of money out. I got a dad I gotta take care of, okay. But none of that shit's got anything to do with me and him. The last thing this boy needs is someone using him. I'm not using him. I know all the players by now. If I were using him, I wouldn't still be hanging around. Leave him alone, Mom! He's my friend. He's not your friend. I don't want you hanging around him. He is, too! (ENGINE STARTING) So she says she don't want me to hang out with the kid no more... after he pitched a great game. I thought I was at least in line for a thank you. What's wrong with you? You "no-showed" at work. I couldn't make it, you know, kid had a game. What are you gonna do, I was busy. You don't just "no-show". I went out of my way to get you that job. And I appreciate the heck out of it, pal... but my phone's been ringing off the hook, man. I had to bring on Stevie just to help answer calls. I'm sorry, dude. Come on, man, I'm sorry. Want a whiskey? Petey, line us up, buddy. - So'd you call her? - Who? After you slept with her, did you call her? No. So you never called her and you're hanging out... with her son and you have no idea why she's upset. You think it's about her? Man, you ain't never dated a woman with kids? No. You can't break up with the woman and still hang out... with the kid, it don't work that way. You've gotta break up with both. Come on, man. Remember Nicole Nvargia? Yeah. I stayed with her for two years... because I couldn't say goodbye to her kids. Those were good kids, though. So you're saying, if I want to hang out with a kid... Then you gotta hang out with the mom. Why don't you go sit at the bar? Because I want to sit at this table. Yeah, well, what are you drinking? A Bud, and look... I'm sorry. For what? Because I never called you... and I've been hanging out with your kid and you know... I know that maybe that's not acceptable. What are you talking about? I know you're pissed, because I never called you. Who told you that bullshit. That's not what's going on? Look, you're nice, but you're depressing as fuck. Then why'd you yell at me? 'Cause you're awful around kids. You told him he was going to have a stroke? No, I told him he could have a stroke. He got punched in the face. Well, kids get into fights, man. Not when they're with adults. You told him he could get into as much trouble... as he wants until he's 18. He told you that? I'm his mother. He tells me everything. I told him within reason. Was that before or after you told him... that he would never play pro baseball? That I was just being on the level with him, I mean... He's 12, he doesn't need you to be on the level with him. He's got his whole life to be disappointed. Let him have this. All right, look, I'm sorry. He said he wanted to get his name on the Wall of Fame... and... and I want to help him do that. You really think he could get his name on the wall? Maybe if he, if he pitches well... for the rest of the season then... maybe. He really pitched well? He did. Okay, fine, but none of this depressing shit. No problem. As long as you guys ain't robbin' houses or nothing. Of course. I'll get you your beer. JOHN (V.O.): Remember when I told you that everything... in my life eventually went to shit? Back him up, and give me a bottle of your finest. - Keep the change. - All right, sure. John. Never seen you in here before. You trying to drum up some votes? No, I came to see you. I want you to stop gambling on the boys baseball games. I have no idea what you're talking about. The other day, a man threw a beer bottle... through one of our umpires' windshields. Shouldn't have blown the call. John. Okay, look, things are a little out of control... but it sure as shit ain't my fault. Your problem is with these animals here in town, not me. Don't make me out to be the bad guy here. What are you going to do? Call the cops. They don't give a shit about gambling. Even if they did, half the Dundalk PD bets through me, so... I'll cancel the season. Can't imagine that's gonna help you get many votes. I know you're robbing houses. I have no idea what you're... I'm running for city office? I talk to people. They voice their concerns. The other day, I'm going door to door and somehow I ended... at Adam Kramer's, he tells me that his TV got stolen... and it's the only thing that they took. He thinks it's some kids from the area... and I think that's a plausible theory. Cops agree with it. Then I find out that the same model TV taken... from Adam Kramer's is at Debbie Houston's. And I know that she's working two jobs just to pay the bills. So there's no way she's buying a brand-new flat-screen TV. Everybody knows that Adam Kramer is a degenerate gambler... and then I hear from some people that he owed you a lot of money. I'm thinking that's a heck of a coincidence. One TV, two links to you. What do you think? I think you're thinking too much. Am I? Maybe I'll run it by Adam Kramer. Good luck running anything by Adam Kramer. But then I'll try Chief Taggart when I meet with him next week. See how many recent robbery victims bet through you. MATT: Thank you much. Hey, what's it going to take? - What? - What do you want? Campaign contribution. You want a cut, cash, what do you want? I want you to do the right thing. (ENGINE STARTING) (KNOCKING) What are you doing? Taking the TV, because you can't keep your mouth shut. What do you mean? I didn't tell anyone. Sure, you didn't. Just like you didn't tell your mommy everything. I didn't tell her about the TV or anyone else. - Oh, then how does everyone know? - I don't know. - Well, I didn't tell anyone. - Well, neither did I! Well then, how does your league commissioner know... that the TV we stole was in your house? I don't know. What are you gonna do with it? It doesn't matter. You need to learn that actions have consequences. What the hell is that? It's a TV, Dad, what does it look like? Well, is it hot? I can't have a hot TV in here. You want the TV or not? - What's the catch? - There's no catch. I got a guy after me, had to watch my back. You got anything on him? No, there's not a damn thing on him, he's clean. Every man's got something. Some guys, you just gotta look harder. Okay. You got any cables? Yeah, I don't know, try the back room. What the fuck do I know about cables? Jesus, this is a big son-of-a-bitch, look at that. And way thin. You kept all this shit? Yeah, what do you mean? Of course I kept it. - Why? - Why? Well, I don't know, I thought maybe someday... you'd like to have it, you know, give it to your kids. Yeah, well it doesn't exactly bring up happy memories, Dad. - Hey, I did my best. - JOHN: Yeah, well... (GASPS) Hey! You okay? Come on, sit down, whoa, whoa. And how long have you been smoking? I don't know, forever. Yup, well, this is how it happens. I know, I know. I would advise you to stop, but you already know that. How many times you want me to say, I know. I was looking at your previous doctor. I don't recognize a Dr. Mancini, he work in the area? - Souza County. - Souza County... hospital? Prison. This should help with the breathing. You're not far away from an oxygen tank if you're wondering. Thank you. Doc? What's this gonna cost me ballpark. I doubt Medicare covers this, so probably 200 bucks. - What, a month? - Three weeks or so. Jesus Christ, what's the point of having Medicare... if it doesn't cover this shit. How long I gotta keep refilling it for? On this medicine, I give him five years, if he's lucky. Thanks. Thank you. I mean, I thought he was dead. Oh, man. I'm a mess, man. It's like, just when I was getting even, this happens. And I got Smitty breathing down my neck. Maybe you should stop. Stop? Why? 'Cause... it's kind of shitty anyway. It's not my fault that people in his town act like savages. Okay? I'm not the one out there telling them... to set the place on fire. But you're handing them the matches. Oh, bullshit, somebody just fucking hates me. Nobody hates you. Circumstances have proven otherwise. You both had it coming. Your dad has been smoking as far back as I have memories... and I've got to say you haven't exactly been on the level. I get no support from you? Well, this is your support. You live life like everyone's in your way. Preventing you from getting to some level of happiness... that I ain't even quite sure is out there. No, people owe me money, okay? I gotta take care of my dad. That money solves real problems for me. You'll but you ticket in beds from guys who don't have lots of money, then they shouldn't bet. Well maybe you shouldn't be taken advantage of them. I just want people to show me the same respect... that I show them. Oh, like the respect you showed me by not showing up for work? You want me to keep going? You have more to say? Things are only unfair when they don't go your way. Aw, fuck you, Scotty. I'm just trying to help, man. Well, I don't want your fucking help. JOHN (V.O.): As much as I hate to admit it... maybe Scotty was right. (MUSIC PLAYING) Maybe I was feeling sorry for myself. You know, if things are gonna break my way... I needed to force the action. I mean, if you're gonna push my back up against the wall... then it's fight or flight, it's kill or be killed. It's bases loaded, bottom of the ninth... and I'll be damned if I'm gonna be blackmailed... by some bitch-ass motherfucker... who's trying to fuck it up for everybody else. (MUSIC CONTINUES) (HORN HONKING) What the fuck, dude!? Were you even paying attention, man? (ENGINE STARTING) One fucking job. What, are you still pissed about the TV? Fine... be mad at me, I don't give a shit. Why were you in Mr. Smith's house? - I was looking for something. - What? I don't know, anything. - Does he owe you money? - No. And you still broke into his house? Yeah, I did. If he doesn't owe you money, then doesn't it make it illegal? You know, I don't know what to say, okay? I don't know how he knows about this TV... and it's putting me in a very fucking bad place. Fuck! Some bullshit always happens. I get kicked in the face. You want to know why I never made it to the majors? You want to know why I'm not in the show? Because my dad got fucked up one night... and he got behind the wheel of a car and he killed someone. He just fucking ran 'em over. My mom split, I had to come home and give up my dream... just to help him with his fucking trial. And I don't have fucking shit! I'm sorry, that was depressing. I promised your mother I wasn't gonna be depressing. I know how he knows about the TV. What? He comes over to see my mom some nights. Matt Smith spends the night at your house. He doesn't spend the night. He comes over after I'm in bed and leaves... before I wake up in the morning. Yeah, but him and your mom, they're... - Yeah. - Are you sure about this? I know what it sounds like. Why didn't you tell me before? I figured if you knew... you wouldn't want to hang out anymore. Hey, hey, man, let's get something straight here, okay? I don't like your mom, like not even in the least bit. I mean, I'm sure she's a great mom to you and all... but me and her, there is nothing going on there. Me and you, we're friends, man. So you're not mad? No! This is fantastic, dude. - It is? - Yeah! Holy shit. (ALL YELLING) Pretty raucous crowd, huh? Yep. So that thing we talked about at the bar... no impact on you. You know, I had to bribe the kid's coach... to get him on the mound? What does that have to do with anything? You being the commissioner... I just figured you could get him on the mound. Why would I do that? Thought maybe you'd want to do him a favor. You know, seein's how you're fucking his mom, and all. It really is the least you could do. That is just blatantly not true. Hmm. What do you want? I just want you to do the right thing. Let's go, Brad. You got this, buddy. You got it, bub! Come on, now! Strike! Are you kidding me, ump? Down by his fucking ankles! Keep it consistent, let's go! What are you swinging at, Brad? Come on now, keep your head in there, what the fuck? Keep it consistent, let's go. (MUSIC PLAYING) (NO AUDIBLE DIALOGUE) How do you look at that pitch, huh? You want to play fucking Tee-ball again? No. Because I can get you a tee and a ball and we can go... hit off that, because you can't seem to hit a ball without it. Stop it, stop crying, you Sally, man up! I can't stop, you're yelling at me. You cost me 200 bucks. You're gonna make it up. I will, I promise. You're damn right, you will! Now get in the fucking car. What are you looking at? Mind your fucking business. (MUSIC STOPS) Hey, kid. Beaches, back the kid up for me, will you? BEACHES: All right. - What's up? - Can we talk? Sure. Maybe not in front of everyone. All right. What's up? - Can we stop? - Stop what? Betting on games. Aw, buddy, you were never bettin' on games, man. Yeah, but will you stop? - No. - Please? No, sorry, pal, it's not gonna happen. You have to stop. Why? What's gotten into you? It's not fun anymore. How is it not fun? You're actually playing well for the first time. I don't know. What then, you want to go back to the way it was before... where you're sitting on the bench... and everybody's calling you names? Is that what you want? BRIAN: No. I'm sorry, I'm just confused, what, like so... you have friends now and you're pitching well... you want to forget about the guy who got you there? Is that it? No. I taught you how to pitch. You think anyone else would have taken the time to do that? - I don't know. - I do, the answer is no. Your whole life and no one ever helped you pitch... and then I come along and I help you out and what... you're gonna take the other guy's side? Is this how you treat your friends? Huh? (MUSIC PLAYING) Hey, Mickey, I got the Dundalk lines. Yeah, Knights are even money. You want NBA also? All right, ten grand on the Knights. Yeah, Kid Houston looks good. Okay. I got you down for it, Mick. Ten G's. Duly noted, Mick. Hey. Look, I'm... Pitch a good game, huh? (SPECTATORS YELLING) - Zibs. - Adam. PLAYER: Outfield back up, good hitter! Smart money's on Houston, huh? Guess it depends on what you consider smart. Well, the number came in low, so I figure you'd dropped... the line by a few runs because you're thinking... Houston's bringing the goods. Plus, Nick Spada had a birthday party last night. It was a sleep over and half the Bears team was there. That so? Yeah, they were probably staying up really late... watching movies, getting real tired, so... Boy, he really hung that one over the plate. Hey, hey, playing catch. (SPECTATORS YELLING) (BOOING) Throw the curve, kid. They shouldn't have pitched him on such short notice. Hey, kid, kid... you thinking about doing any of the things we worked on? Fine, suit yourself. JOHN (V.O.): It was ugly, pretty much sold the other team... prime real estate on home plate. Didn't throw the curve ball once. Didn't do a damn thing we worked on. Stubborn, little shit. Couldn't have picked a worse game to stick it to me, either. I had more money on this one than the Super Bowl. And look, maybe I was wearing a pair of those... rose-colored glasses when I set the line. Maybe this kid never had it in the first place. Either way, it didn't look good. And the natives, they got restless. Lucky for me, Smitty caved and cancelled the whole season... before the game ended. (MEGAPHONE ALARM SOUNDING) Hey, hey, hey, hey! That's it, that's it, enough! Enough! JOHN (V.O.): And well, if nobody loses the game... and nobody loses a bet... we have ourselves a push and we can all walk away... with our heads held high and our wallets the same weight. No harm, no foul. You need a ride? Here. We're all square. (SOFT MUSIC PLAYING) (CAR HORNS HONKING) (CHURCH BELL TOLLS) (MUSIC CONTINUES) JOHN (V.O.): So, all said and done... looks like I made it out of this whole mess unscathed. I managed to collect most of my outstanding debts. Put a little extra scratch in my pocket and shit... walk away in better shape than before it all started. All said and done, it puts me in the black... which is all you can ever ask for. So yeah, there you go, that's my story. As for basketball lines, playoffs look predictable... this year, might have to jump the line on the favorites... a point or two, since it's top-heavy. You know, local gamblers like to play the favorites... so knowing that, I gotta protect myself... from all the action heading one way. Johnnie, let me help you with that. Get in the fucking house. Fuck. Come on, guys, what the fuck is this? Trying to throw games on us. Mickey. Yeah, play dumb like you didn't have that kid throw the game. How long have I known you guys? Huh? Why would I throw a fucking game? I can think of about 10,000 reasons. Stevie, how many bets have I let you slide on. Sorry, Johnny, it doesn't look so good. I got you a job, man. Johnny, you met my nephew, right? Yeah... fuck, ow! Shit. Whoo! God... I'm telling you, okay, look, the kid pitched bad... because he was mad at me, all right? Fucking kids, right? Fuck! God! Where'd you say the cash was? JOHN: Oh, come on, you made your point. Oh fuck. This makes us just about even. Even? Come on, Mick, they didn't even fucking finish the game. I don't think you lost shit, buddy. Johnny, you know, if we let you pull one over on us... we gotta let everybody do it. Oh, come on, guys, that's all the money I got. Here you go, dinner on us. Sorry, Johnny. Come on, man, just pee. Come on, man, pee. Daddy, is that Sparkle? - Why does that guy have our dog? - Ssh-ssh. Um, guys, just wait right here, please, okay? John? Hey Bill, what's up? Why do you have my dog, John? Is that your dog? Did you break into my house and steal my fucking kids' dog? What? No, man. Then why do you have my kids' dog? You broke into my house and took my kids' dog... because I owed you 500 bucks? You owe me $600 bucks, man. Do you have any idea of the crying that has been going on... in my house, for what, to get even with me? Well, I just... I mean... - Daddy! Daddy, are you okay? - Go back, girls, go back! - I'm okay. - Shit, man. - Fuck, man. - What'd you come at me for, man? I just wanted my fucking dog. Yeah, dude, take the dog, man. There... there. You know, I was gonna pay you... but I got laid off from my job. Times have been tough. I didn't know that. You know, I saw you the other day and you had on that... new watch and I was like... okay. - This... this... this watch? - Yeah. This $75 watch, here, man, you can have it. I didn't know... Hey, yeah, this is what they give you when they lay you off. As a way of saying thanks, like... "Hey, you don't have a job or a pension... "but here's a nice watch." I'm sorry, I didn't know that. Yeah, well... Hey, you don't have to pay me back, man. We're all good. You look like shit. Take care of yourself. Let's go, girls, come on, Sparkle, come on. - WALLY: Here you go. - Thanks. WALLY: Mm-hm... Hey man, are you sure you don't want something for your face? WALLY: Right on. Ain't Debbie working? Nah, she was, but she had to leave early. Oh. It was some emergency with her kid. What happened? Apparently, he broke into her ex-husband's house. - You know Hooper, right? - Yeah. Yeah, well, kid was still in there when his old man got home. Get this, Hooper sees him and beats the shit out of him. He told the cops he thought he was robbing the place... but if you ask me, Hooper did it to teach him a lesson. - Is he okay? - Get the fuck away from my house. - Wait, wait, I just wanna know... - I said get the fuck outta here! - Just hang on a second. - Leave. What? I want to know if he's all right. This is your fault. - My fault? - Yes. You know what? Maybe if you spent more time at his games... than with the fucking commissioner... we'd be talking about something else. Fuck, god... fucking... He's not your kid, okay? He is my kid! You think because you hung out with him for a couple of weeks... and taught him how to pitch that somehow he's your kid? He's not. You have no idea what it's like being a parent... to have to put food on the table and pay rent. Explain to him why his dad is a piece of shit. You know what? It's not my fault his Dad's... - a fucking piece of shit. - You used him. How the fuck did I use him? I told you about the gambling. Nobody gives a shit about your gambling! How the fuck am I using him? Because you were there when it was ballgames and pizza. Where were you when he needed you... when he was so upset that he broke into his dad's house? I have been there for that kid. My son doesn't need another man in his life letting him down... and I knew from the second I saw you sitting at my table... it was only a matter of time... before you would turn your back on him. - Jesus, what happened to you? - Nothing. Wh... what are you doing? Where's my shit? Where's my... where's my bat, Dad? What do you want that for? Hey, hey, look, why don't you take a deep breath... and just calm down for a second before you do something stupid. Huh? Will you hold the fuck on! Sit down for a second! I meant to do it! You meant to do what? I was drunk when I ran Bernie Gallagher over... but I meant to do it... he was having an affair with your mother. You're just telling me this shit now. Bernie and I drank at the same pub and the night I found out... I look at his fucking face across the bar... and I start going for him. Bernie starts running away and I'm chasing him. I think, "This is fucking crazy." So I tell myself, go outside, go outside, calm down. So I go outside and I'm sitting in my car... but I'm getting more and more upset. And then Bernie comes out of the bar. And you ran him over with your fucking car? Well, I didn't plan it! It boiled me over, I lost my shit. - And Mom? - She left. She... she kept her mouth shut during the whole trial process. Thank God, God bless her... because it could have been worse, I think. Maybe she felt bad for me, I don't know. A little guilty maybe. Anyway, she couldn't stay here, she left. You... Look, I spent 10 years in prison for doing something stupid. Now look at me, will you? Look at me. This is what getting even looks like. Get the fuck out of my way. Come on. (MUSIC PLAYING) JOHN (V.O.): Look, I know what you're thinking. I didn't think it was heading this way either... but here we are. And tell me, what would you do if you're in my shoes? Would you let it slide? Maybe you're a better person than I am. Come here. Do we know each other? - Why? - Why? Because you keep eye-fucking me from across the room. Went to high school together, I'm John Zbikowsky. I played baseball. Oh shit, Zibs, yeah. Sorry, man, I didn't recognize you, you look like shit. What happened? You all right? Fine, man. So what? You just came here... to catch up on old times or something. No. What's up, then, what's with the bat? You gotta ball game or something? Why are you looking at me like that, man? You got something... You got some business with me or something? We got a problem? I mean... You know my ex-wife or something? No, nope. Softball game. (BILLIARD BALLS CLACK) One too many beers, that's all. Yeah, well... fucking take care of yourself, dude, you look like shit. Hm. - (BASEBALL ORGAN PLAYS) - (CROWD CHEERING) What are you doing? I'm trying to be a "leaves-a-note" guy. Hm. Last time I was here, I didn't really do the right thing. Yeah, I know. I've read it after Mr. Mooney threw it on ground. And you let me carry on like this the whole time? Yeah, I guess so. I guess I just didn't care. What happened to you? I think I got what was coming to me. Yeah, me, too. I think maybe I gave you some bad advice... these past couple of weeks. You don't go breaking into houses, no matter what. Okay. Here, give that to your mom for the hospital bill. Okay. It's not a lot, but it's all I got at the moment. Want to know the real reason I quit playing baseball? You told me about your dad. No, that's not it. I wasn't good enough. I was getting knocked around in single A. Yeah, I could have worked hard and got better... but that shit with my dad happened... and it's just easier to quit. So I came home and I took over his book. My whole life, I've been taking the easy route... and I think maybe I used you as part of that easy route... and I apologize. - It's cool. - No, it's not cool. I'm sorry, friends don't do that to friends. I got to pitch, I got in a fight, I bet on horses. This is the best fucking summer of my life. Me, too. Never got your name on that wall, though. It's alright. So what are you going to do now? I don't know, probably take a job, I guess. You still gonna take bets? I say no now, but football season's gonna roll around... - I probably got to reassess. - Yeah. What are you gonna do with the rest of the summer? Don't know. Might want to figure that out before school starts back up. Next season, will you come see me pitch? Shit, yeah. (SOFT MUSIC PLAYING) Hey, we got a letter from a guy named Zibs.
