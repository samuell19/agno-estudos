Jules Verne wrote many books. He was able to transfer his soaring imagination to print. His predictions were bold. What he wrote was regarded as fantastic fiction but much of it has become fact. Flying machines, submarines, television, rockets. But not even his imagination could shrink the earth to the point it has now reached. He wrote a book called From the Earth to the Moon. And in Paris, that authentic genius Georges Méliès turned it into a movie, 35 millimeter just as you're looking at it now. It was, of course, fantasy. But as of now, no one has yet gone to the moon to see whether Méliès was right. Here is the actual film as Méliès' camera recorded it at the turn of the century. I suppose that since man began to walk upright he has been interested in space and speed. He has wondered increasingly about the planets he sees in the sky. The stretching fingertips of science have moved him higher and faster than man has ever moved before. One of Jules Verne's characters, a fanatic and a dreamer argues for the construction of a rocket to the moon. After reasoned discourse, the venture is launched. This is the first photographic dissolve. This is a do-it-yourself rocket. Rockets have changed. Photography has changed. Costumes have changed. But some things remain unchanged, even in imagination of Verne and Méliès. Jules Verne's rocket returns to the earth a minor planet, where fiction lags behind the fact. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, fire! There is, in this power of destruction also the promise of hope. A world of unlimited power and limitless hope. Man has devised a method of destroying most of humanity or of lifting it up to high plateaus of prosperity and progress never dreamed of by the boldest dreamers. You are now looking at the receding shape of this planet, Earth. This is how the earth looks from a camera in the rocket. Jules Verne wrote a book about going around the world in 80 days. He even predicted it could be done in 80 hours. Today it can be done in less than half that time. But each journey must have an end. Speed is got only when wisdom leads the way. The end of this journey whether to the high horizons of hope or the depths of destruction will be determined by the collective wisdom of the people who live on this shrinking planet. There was a time not so long ago when learned men thought that was flat. Around the World in 80 Days is the Jules Verne classic. And the world was already shrinking when it was written. And that was in 1872. Morning paper. Get your morning paper here. All about the bank robbery here. Get your morning paper. Paper, sir? Get your paper here. All about the bank robbery here. Get your morning paper here. Get your morning paper. Here you are. Paper, sir? Paper. - Good morning, sir. - Good morning, Thorndyke. - Hinshaw. - Yes, sir? Somebody's been tampering with my Telegraph. The pages are all crushed. Eh, yes, sir. One of the members borrowed it to read about the robbery. You mean it's been used? - Kindly remove it and send out for a fresh one. - At once, sir. I'm a patient man, Hinshaw, but don't trespass on my good feelings. Psst. Pilbeam! Did you hear that? - Some fellow stole that chap's paper. - The devil, you say! Word of honor. First time it's happened here to my knowledge, in 45 years. The club's going to the dogs. Next thing you know, all the members will be talking to each other! - Yes, it's the thin end of the wedge. - All daft. - Ice, me Lord? - Ice? Certainly not. What do I look like, a polar bear? Sorry, sir. Several of the members use it now and then. Learned it from some Yankee, I dare say. Those redskins over there drink anything. A dangerous customer I've always thought, sir. A man might catch a nasty chill on his liver. Or break a tooth. Remind me to speak to the House Committee about it. No, by gad! I'll write a letter to The Times. - Psst, Hinshaw, I say, Hinshaw. - Yes, Mr. Mockridge? Must we have that confounded animal around here stamping its feet? - Mind the horse! - Who does he think he is? - That bloke is balmy! - That bloke is a Yankee, I'll bet! There's a sight! Move over, sir! Move over! Move that confounded contraption! When I first placed you with Mr. Fogg a fortnight ago I warned you that he was an eccentric. An eccentric, Mr. Hesketh-Baggott? The man's a tyrant. A cold-hearted, implacable fiend. Must I remind you, Foster, that you are speaking of a member of the Reform Club? I don't care if he's a member of the Worshipful Company of Fishmongers. The man's mad! Actually, excessive sanity is not a necessary qualification - for that particular institution. - Believe me, sir, he's not human. You know how many valets he's had during the last six months? Certainly I do. I've supplied him with five of them myself. And are you aware that he tortured them with a refinement of cruelty which would have put Torquemada and the entire Spanish Inquisition to shame? He's a cold and methodical as those two watches he carries about with him. Come, come, come, come, Foster. You are abandoning yourself to rhetoric. Kindly remember that you have been rigorously trained as a gentleman's gentleman. A gentleman's gentleman is one thing, sir. - A whimpering, cringing, slave is another. - Foster. You are allowing your native imperturbability to be swept away by a spate of mounting hysteria. - You really must calm down. - I can't help it, sir. If you knew how ardently I have worked for Mr. Fogg, how enthusiastically I have endeavored to cater to his every whim. His bath water had to be exactly one foot, three and one-quarter inches. No less, no more. His morning toasted to be 83 degrees Fahrenheit. - No more, no less. - Extraordinary. How does one take the temperature of toast? Incidentally... Have you found out anything definite about him? I'm mean... Who he is, what he does? - Not the fainted indication, sir. Have you? - Alas, no. All I have discovered is entirely negative. He is not a professional man, and he isn't in trade. He has no family connections or background worth mentioning. He doesn't go in for hunting, or fishing, or wenching. Can not imagine how he ever got into the Reform Club! Perhaps your uncle, the Bishop might inquire for you there, sir. - He is a member, is he not? - One of the most distinguished, Foster. We are a very ancient family, you know. Now, I was just rather curious about our precious Mr. Fogg. I suppose he'll be hectoring me soon for someone to fill your place. And thank you for your cooperation, Foster. We must pray for guidance. You have a nice little position for a gentleman's gentleman, sir? - For you? - Yes, sir. Never doubt for one instant, Foster, the efficacy of prayer. What is your name? Passepartout. - Passepartout? - Yes, sir. I am from a very ancient family, sir. Obviously. You've led a rather speckled career, I see. Professor of gymnastics. - Yes, sir. Watch. - No demonstrations, please. Trapeze artist, fireman, chimney sweep. - Amazing. How did you come to England? - In a clothes basket, sir. I escaped. - From what? - Women, sir. A ladies' man, huh? Well, there are no women in this household. Now, my conditions are strict. My timetable never varies. When I say breakfast at 8:24, - I do not mean at 8:23 or at 8:25. - Yes, sir. - Do you have a watch? - Oh, yes, sir. It's probably wrong. Hmm. Very well. See that you behave yourself. Any tomfoolery and out you go. Oh, come on now, Ralph, don't be so secretive. - You're one of the governors of the bank. - Yes. Let's have some lurid details. Nothing to tell you. You've read the newspapers. Oh, they always exaggerate. Do you mean to say the thief actually got away with £55,000? He did, in brand new bank notes. Smote fill large denominations, £500 or £1,000 each. How did you know that? We didn't disclose that to the press. I assumed it. The £55,000 of small currency would have needed a handcart to transport it. Therefore, it must have been compact enough to stuff into one's pockets. You're right. The man's audacity staggers the imagination. Imagine sauntering up to the head cashier's table and pilfering a sum like that from under his very nose. Serves you right in a way. Surely you have some better hiding place for your funds than the cashier's nose? Your persiflage does not amuse. This has been totally unexpected blow to us. Unexpected, Mr. Ralph? Bankers must expect robbery much the same way that chickens expect hawks. It's an occupational hazard. My lead, I believe. By the way, what was the head cashier doing at the time? He's writing receipt for the three-shilling deposit. Oh, no... Go ahead and jeer, gentlement. We shall lay the culprit by the heels soon enough. We've notified detectives all over the world from Liverpool to Cairo. We've issued the descriptions throughout Europe and America. He won't get any far. I wouldn't underestimate him if I were you, Mr. Ralph. You're dealing with a rather exceptional person. Really? In what way? Only a cool and logical individual could have engineered such an exploit. Obviously a gentlemen, money can considerable presence of mind. You seem to know rather more about this affair than the police. Merely what one might deduce from the facts. Logically. Well, if you ask me, I'd say the odds were in favor of the thief. If he's such a resourceful chap, as Fogg says, he'll find plenty of places to hide. Oh, yes. The world's a pretty large affair, after all. It was 100 years ago, it's not any longer. A man can girdle the globe now in three months. Less than that, to be precise. In 80 days. You mean a complete tour all around the world in 80 days? I mean just that. - Eh, he's talking nonsense. - No, no, Fogg may have a point there. The Great Indian Peninsula Railway was opened only a fortnight ago. That shortens the trip considerably. I read about that in The Daily Telegraph. Oh, hang The Daily Telegraph. I say it's impossible. Nothing is impossible. When science finally conquers the air, it may be feasible to circle the globe in 80 hours. Oh, it's a beautiful dream, but I'm talking about this moment and I say there's nobody can go around the world in 80 days. And I agree. Well, even if one made ideal connections at every point there'd still be typhoons, shipwrecks, unforeseen delays. I include the unforeseen. You're pretty glib, Fogg, but I'd like to see you do it in 80 days. You're convinced that I could not? So much so that I'll wager £5,000 that you can't. Let me understand you clearly, Stuart. Are you formally challenging me to undertake a journey around the world in 80 days? I am, sir, and I'm prepared to back my conviction - by posting my check right here and now. - Very well, I accept. I say, this is absurd. The joke's gone far enough. An Englishman never jokes about a wager, sir. My gentlemen, I have on deposit at Barings Bank the sum of £20,000. And I'm willing to wager any or all of it upon the same contention. Namely, that I can complete a tour of the world in 80 days. That is to say, 1,920 hours or 115,200 minutes. Would anyone besides Stuart care to participate? I'm no gambler, but if you want to make foolhardy bets that you can't possibly win, I'm afraid I shall be forced to take you on. - So am I with you. - So am I. What about you, Ralph? My affiliation with the Bank of England naturally precludes my betting but as a member of this club, I might under very special circumstances. Then it's agreed? We all accept? - Yes. - Yes, sir. Very well. If I remember correctly, the boat train for Dover leaves London Bridge Station at 8:45 tonight. - I will be on it. - Tonight? Don't you need a couple of days to settle your affairs, - to make preparations? - No. I'm quite ready now. You engage to be back here in London, in the Reform Club on Saturday, September 21st at 8:45 p.m. Now, gentlemen, clubs, I believe, are still trumps. Shall we finish the game? - Yes, please? - Come to my bedroom at once. Yes, sir. - I called you twice. - I came as fast as possible, sir. You are not supposed to be home yet, sir. My usual routine is beside the point. We leaving for the Continent in 10 minutes. - Monsieur is going traveling? - Yes. Around the world. Then you will not be here for breakfast. Around the world? Exactly. Now reassemble your faculties and start packing. Si, señor. Which clothes does, monsieur, I mean, which trunks? None whatever. Just take two shirts and three pairs of hose for each of us. - But I have only one shirt, sir. - Then take that. We'll buy whatever else we need en route. Give me that red bag. Open it up. We'll need plenty of money. Whatever you do, never let this out of your sight. Monsieur can trust me. I will cherish it like a woman. Don't make love to it. Just watch it. Excuse me, sir. My cousin. Mademoiselle. Excuse me, sir. Is not my cousin. Oh! Thomas Cook and Son. Thomas Cook. Cook. - Cook. - Ah, Cook... Merci Mille fois, monsieur, et bon voyage. Mes homages, madame. Ah, you purchase the tickets. I'll be back in a moment. All right, sir. Entrez. Now, monsieur, train to Marseilles, steamer to Bombay via Suez, across India by train, and steamer again to Hong Kong. Only one drawback. With this route, you miss Bali and the women. But no, women of Bali cannot be described. - Please try. - Oh, no, no, monsieur. Words would fail me. In any case, in Yokohama, you will encounter the geisha girls, and those, monsieur, are not to be sneezed at. I shall remember. In Yokohama, I must not sneeze at geisha girl. Then, between San Francisco and New York, you will discover Indian maidens galore, statuesque, barbaric creatures. Hah, monsieur, what a crime you have only 80 days. However, first things first. Here are your tickets to Marseilles. Cancel those tickets, Passepartout. There are of no further use to us. - We cannot go by train. - Has something happened? A wreck? No, an avalanche has sealed the Montfort tunnel, and nothing can get through for a week. Then the road are blocked, too. How can we go on? I don't know. But I refuse to be daunted at this stage of the game. There must be another way. There has to be. But after all, we are not birds. We cannot fly across the mountains. That, monsieur, is not unfeasible, fantastic as it seems. Isn't she lovely? I have made 63 ascents, gentlemen, to an elevation over 1,000 meters. I've flown through the skies at a speed surpassing that of an eagle. Are you quite sure, sir, this is not just gallic braggadocio? Monsieur, you are now addressing the second most-celebrated balloonist in Europe. - And who is the first? - He is not available. He was buried last Tuesday. Tell me, sir, is this apparatus of yours for lease? If I operate it, yes. If you do, it's only for sale. - Passepartout, the bag. - Yes, sir. - We purchase your balloon, sir. - Thank you, sir. Passepartout! Passepartout! Come on, man. Now, it's really very simple. We empty out some sand, and we go up. Then we pull this, and with any luck, we come down. I imagine we've release some gas from the top of the balloon. Gas! Mr. Fogg, I forgot to turn off the gas in my room. No matter. It will continue to burn at your expense. Well, gentlemen, I think this calls for a restrained celebration. Guess what's become of the intrepid Mr. Fogg? - What? - He's drifting over the Alps in a balloon. - A balloon. - What's he doing in one of those? Don't ask me, but it's here in this paper. - I say, he never mentioned the word balloon. - Not very sporting, is it? Rather sly, if you ask me. I wouldn't have thought it of old Fogg. Oh, I don't know, seems quite resourceful to me. English ingenuity, never say die, all that sort of thing. Does it happen to mention over which Alps he's drifting? No. I assumed they were the ones in Switzerland. Use your globe, sir. Could be the Maritime Alps, in the south of France. In which case Fogg's not only on schedule, but ahead of it. We stand to lose £20,000. What was that you said about a celebration, Stuart? If nobody wants this newspaper, I'll just put it on the table. The southern perimeter of France, Passepartout. Often and with justification referred to in the guidebooks as the "Azure Coast". I think, the moment is propitious for our descent. Yes, sir. The gas valve's stuck, I think. Can you get up there? I'll try it, master. These people seem to be speaking some bizarre foreign tongue. - Do you understand them? - Yes, master. And ask the folk with how far we are from Marseilles, and what conveyance they have for us to proceed. Yes, sir. - Why aren't they speaking French? - Because we are in Spain, master. - Spain? - Yes, sir. It's a long trip to Marseilles. But by sea, in a fast boat, 10 hours. Where would we procure such a boat? There is one vessel here. The boat of Abdul Achmed of Tangiers. Where would we find this worthy? He sleeps by day. But at night, he's in the Cave of the Seven Winds. - You think that's the man we're looking for? - I think so, master. Excuse me, master. Good evening, sir. It is forbidden to approach his august personage. Perhaps you would transmit a message? I would like to engage his yacht for a quick trip to Marseilles. I will pay whatever he asks. The ship is yours, sir. Go where you wish without charge. However, my master is an aficionado of the bullfight. That is why he visits here, to see the festival of the bulls. I do not understand. He was most interested in your servant's display of capework. He would like to see more tomorrow at the bullfight. You mean he wants him to enter the ring? - But that will be a massacre! - Please, master. I'm not afraid. Let me try. Itoro! Ole! Ole! Ole! Ole! Ole! Ole! Ole! Ole! Ole! Ole! Ole! Ole! Don't push me. It's the first time I've seen a real bull. I don't want to fight. Look at the horns. It's not my size. Try to be nice to me. Try to be nice. Ole! Ole! Ole! Ole! Ole! Ole! Ole! Moo! Moo! Mmm! Ole! Ole! Ole! Ole! Ole! Ole! Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! Grrr! Ole! Ole! Ole! Grrr! Ole! Ole! Ole! Ole! Ole! Ole! Ole! Ole! My ship is yours. If you leave now, you will arrive in Marseilles in 10 hours. - The odds are 30-to-1, gentlemen. - £50 he doesn't. - What was that, Mr. Vermilyea? - I said, £50 he doesn't. And 150 he does. Why delude ourselves? Even if the odds do go down, we know that Fogg got from Marseilles to Brindisi in time to catch the Mongolia. Ah, but suppose he doesn't get to Suez in time? His whole itinerary's thrown out of schedule. He can't possibly get from Bombay to Calcutta in time for his connection. No, our money's as safe, gentlemen, as if it were in the Bank of England. Ups, sorry. A bulletin, gentlemen. A late bulletin. Mr. Phileas Fogg has arrived at Suez! Name, sir? - Name, sir? - Passepartout. - Thank you. - Here! Just a minute. Where's the gentleman who owns this passport, this Mr. Phileas Fogg? - My master is staying on board. - Indeed. Well, he'll have to report in person to the British Consulate to establish his identity. - Is that necessary? - Eh, not necessary, mandatory. It's mandatory. This is different, sir. Mr. Fogg is at lunch now, but I will give him your message. - Hello there. - Hello, señor. - Going sightseeing? Perhaps I can help. - I have to buy some clothing for Mr. Fogg. Well, I can show you an excellent place quite nearby. Oh, monsieur is very kind. You see, my master and I came away without our clothes. Then I take it you left London hastily? Lucky shoot. Forty-five minutes after he told me, - we are off around the world. - Around the world? Yes, sir. Around the world in 80 days. He says it's a wager. But confidentially, between you and me, I don't believe a word of it. Something else in the wind, eh? I understand he gave the officers of the Mongolia a bonus - to get the ship here ahead of time. - Oh, yes, sir. - He must be a very rich man. - Ooh, la la, you can't imagine how much money we carry with us all in brand-new bank notes. Well, I'm sure you can take good care of him. No doubt you've been with Mr. Fogg for years. Oh, no, sir. On the contrary. I entered his service only the day we left London. Indeed. So he turned up, did he? Yes, and I must say he gave every indication of being a thoroughly honest fellow. Or a very shrewd article. Here's the description of the robber I received from London. Yes. It tallies exactly. What do you propose to do? Notify London to send a warrant to Bombay, I company him there, and arrest him the moment he sets foot on British soil. Very enterprising of you, Fix. A nice ocean voyage at the expense of Scotland Yard? I beg your pardon, sir. I see my duty, and I do it. Thank you, sir. I beg pardon, gentlemen, we're expecting rather hot weather tomorrow, so I've arranged the menu accordingly: "Cold breast of chicken, potted meats and brawn," - "curried lamb and rice." - Hah, capital. Curry's the only dish for a chap in this filthy climate. Purifies the blood, tones up the system by luncheon... My lunch will remain the same, steward. Kindly adhere to my instructions. Of course, sir. But all that food on a hot day? Steward, my Thursday midday meal has always been and will always be hot soup, fried sole, roast beef and Yorkshire pudding, baked potatoes, suet pudding and treacle. Your deal, Bishop. Well, we meet again. Feeling the heat a bit, are you? How about a nice lemon squash or a beer? - It's good. - Steward! Bring two lemon squashes. Great stroke of luck we happen to be on the same ship, wasn't it. - And both going to Bombay. - Oh, yes. A strange coincidence. - Have you made this trip before? - Oh, yes, often. I, uh, I'm one of the agents for the steamship company. - Oh, you know India well? - My dear fellow, I doubt if there are five men who know it as I do. The mosques, the minarets, the elephants, the snakes. What about the women? Ha-ha, yes. The women. Superb. - In what ways superb? - Goddesses. Ravishing. But, uh, listen, this tour of your master's, what do you think his real purpose is? Perhaps it's only a secret diplomatic mission. I tell you, Mr. Fix. I really know nothing about it. Don't change the conversation. Tell me more about these Indian women. Well, now, let me see. Would you excuse me? I will be back in a minute. Bombay by dawn tomorrow, Mr. Fogg. Two days ahead of schedule. - That's a new record for the run. - A remarkable achievement, Captain, and one that deserves adequate recognition. - My compliments to you. - Thank you. And the chief engineer. Uh, as arranged. Now listen to me carefully. Here's the list of the gear we'll so need on our journey across Calcutta. While you're getting that, I'll deal with the passports and the tickets. The train leaves at 4:00. We'll meet at the railway station. Oui, monsieur. Mooo! Infidel! How dare you! That's a sacred animal! We've no warrant for this fellow's arrest. The whole thing is highly irregular, dash it all! But he's the culprit, I swear to you. Wait a moment. I have an idea. You issue the order for this arrest. - What? I couldn't do a thing like that! - Not even for a reward of £2,000? - Needless to say, I'd be willing to divide it. - £1,000? No, Mr. Fix. The matter involves London. And the London office alone can legally deliver the warrant. Once Fogg's outside British jurisdiction, I'll never get him. - Quite. Good heavens! 4:00. It's tea time. - Yes, I know. But this is a crisis. Crisis or no, nothing should interfere with tea. Devil take the man. Where could he be? Oh, chasing after some woman or other, I suppose. These foreigners, you know. Come on, man! Come on! Come on, man! Come on! - Thank you, master. - There will be no further fiddle-faddle. Yes, Fogg, There was a time when one could scarcely traveling in this part of the country without encountering corpses. Those infamous stranglers. What did you say the named that sect was? - Thuggee. - Thuggee. Uh-huh. Individual members are known as Thugs. They worship Kali, the goddess of death. They slay without discrimination. Any age, sex, color. How did you finally manage to stamp them out? Oh, we didn't. Not entirely. Our constabulary managed to diminish the number of murders, but we're forced to recognize the Thuggee still exists. Every few months we come across a few of the wretches at their ghastly rites. Strange we should stop hereabouts. Timetable makes no mention of a station in this vicinity. I have no idea. To tell you the truth, I haven't been on this line since they announced its completion. Hmm. - Excuse me, sir. What is the difficulty? - Difficulty? None whatever. This is the end of the line. - End of the line? - Yes. There's still 50 miles of track to be laid between here and Allahabad. But the London newspapers announced the opening of this railway throughout. It must have been The Daily Telegraph. Never have read that in The Times. The fact remains, sir, that you sold tickets from Bombay to Calcutta! That's fraud, sir. Fraud! I shall take this up with the Viceroy! The notice in our Bombay station is quite clearly posted as it is here: "Passengers must provide their own transportation" - "between Kholby and Allahabad." - All through the bush? I'm sorry if this inconveniences, gentlemen. It does indeed. I happen to be rejoining my brigade, the 10th Jubbulpore. My friend here stands to lose a considerable sum of money. Not at all. I made provision for precisely that sort of eventuality. Oh, come on, man, you couldn't possibly have foreseen this. No, but I did expect some such obstacle to arise en route. And I took the precaution of gaining two extra days while crossing the Arabian Sea. Now, a steamer leaves Calcutta at noon on the 25th for Hong Kong. Our only problem at the moment is to find some form of conveyance from here to Allahabad. Other than the oxcart, nothing can get through that jungle. - Hmm. What about an elephant? - Well, I do happen to know of one, but I doubt if the owner would part with her. - Why not? - She sleeps in the house, with the family. A pet. £1,000 for an elephant? It's outrageous! You've been diddled. Undoubtedly, but it's not often one needs an elephant in a hurry. - What is that? - Tiger. A royal Bengal tiger. They rarely attack an elephant. Oh, yes. - What the deuce are you doing? - Quiet, sir. - Is bad. - What is it? It's a religious procession of some sort. Rather sticky if they spot us. Hmm. I think we had better look into this. Shh! Kali, the goddess of love and death. Sahib, please! If they hear our voices, we will be slain. - Hmm. Suttee. - What do you mean by that? A human sacrifice, but a voluntary one. The lady you've just seen is to be burned on funeral pyre of her husband's. Scoundrels. You actually mean that unfortunate young woman is going to be burned alive? Oh, she's quite resigned to it. It's a matter of religious belief. This area's not under British jurisdiction. There's nothing we can do. Forgive me, sahib. But the lady does not wish to commit Suttee. - She is being forced. - What? Everyone knows of this affair. Her husband was a rajah and very influential. - The custom is that she must die with him. - Where is this wretched murder to take place? The pagoda of Pillaji. Two miles from here. What if we decided to save her? Good heaven, man, you can't interfere with native affairs. - Why not? - Err, this is done! My master does things other people do not, sir. You think you can rescue Aouda, sir? - Is that the lady's name? - Yes, sahib. Aouda. Very fine person. Very beautiful. Very. She was educated in England. That decides it. General, we place ourselves under your command. Right. Now, our first step is to reconnoiter. Now, uh... Follow me. Devilish! There are guards all about the temple. - I can't seem to find an opening. - And the Princess? - Inside. Surrounded by armed men. - What course would you suggest? Oh, simple. Outflank the beggars. - Now. Here's the temple. No, no, here. - Mm-hmm. Here's the funeral pyre. We create a distractionary action here, start a sortie here. - General, I have a plan. - Please! Then we infiltrate the guards from the rear. - Excellent. - Exactly. Only one problem. This plan can't possibly work with less than 75 men. So, speaking as a strategist, I should say our position here is untenable. Neverless, whatever the odds, I'm determined to abstract that young woman. Even though we're only four. Passepartout... Passepartout. Well, now where the devil is he? But... Aah! Aah! Aah! Hurry up! Come on! - Oh, gentlemen, you have rescued me! All of you. - This is no time to demonstrate your gratitude. Allow me to help you. "Speechless at the violation of a native temple" "and the abduction of an Indian Princess" "by Mr. Phileas Fogg, the authorities have arrested him." "An Indian Princess". Lucky dog! An absolute scandal, according to this. The whole peninsula's up in arms against. Wonder what she's like. A handsome creature, I'll be bound. Always thought old Fogg had a twinkle in his eye. Handsome or not, this business of barging about a native temple with one boots on is a very serious matter. Could have been, if Fogg hadn't posted bail and caught the next ship. I'm beginning to think our colleague's a good bit cleverer than we supposed. A devious type, I'd rather say. Let me see, if he's on the S.S. Rangoon, he must be halfway to Hong Kong by now. Somewhere here. - Uh... - Uh. So I did the only decent thing a man could do. - You mean... - Yes, I finessed my queen of hearts and forced Finch-Tattersall to sacrifice his ace. It was a tense moment, I can assure you. I wish you had seen Lord Dudley's expression. Poor fellow went dead white. Bit clean through his pipe stem. Heh. Oh, well. - But I'm afraid I've bored you. - How can you say that, Mr. Fogg? Oh, I don't think that in my entire life. That's the most enthralling story I've ever heard. Do you really mean that? - I'm most awfully pleased. - It's so... - It's so personal and yet dramatic. - That's exactly the way I feel about it! I had no idea you were so keen about whist. I adore it. There is a kind of precision about it. I've always admired men who are precise, who have a sense of order and discipline. - Fancy that. - Yes, for example. Well, I simply cannot abide a man who isn't punctual. It's extraordinary how well you put it. We have so little time in our brief mortal span. Oh, my dear Princess, I really must ask your forgiveness. - Why, whatever for? - It just dawned upon me I completely forgot to offer my condolences upon your bereavement. - What? - To extend my sympathy for your anguish at this time of grief. - But I don't feel any grief, Mr. Fogg. - None at all? You see, I was a wife in name only. I met the late rajah exactly once, at the age of seven, before my parents sent me to England for my education. And you never saw him again? Never. Would you care to hear about the time I drew a flush hand in diamonds? If you'd care to confide in me. Is Mr. Fogg always so proper, haughty and formal? Believe me, madame, I know nothing about him except that he lives by this. Have there been any women in his life? I assume that he must have had a mother, but I am not certain. Perhaps he has some secret sorrow, some love who jilted him. He has only one love, madame. Cards. Whist. He thinks of nothing but the whist, morning, noon, and night. Oh, very interesting. Yes, he's a cool article, Mr. Tally. A very unpredictable cove. Just when you think you've cornered him, he gives you the slip. - Got you puzzled, has he? - Yes, by jingo, he has. Look at this heathen young woman, for instance, this Mrs. Aouda. I know my man, Tally. And I tell you, she don't fit into the pattern. He was down here, you know, about an hour ago. - He was? - Mm. - What did he want? - Oh, this, that, and the other. He was quizzing me about steamships out of Hong Kong. - For where? - Yokohama. We're due at Hong Kong at noon tomorrow. And he sails on the S.S. Carnatic at 8:00 the following day. Ha-ha, that's what he thinks, but I'll nail him this time you can pledge your last farthing on that. You didn't do so well at Calcutta, according to you own stake. What could I do? I got him and his servant's bail set at £1,000 a piece. And he hands it over without batting a lash. If that blasted warrant had only arrived. Cheer up. You've got 20 hours to get him in Hong Kong before the Carnatic sails. Yes, sir, I'll lag the blighter there if I have to turn out the Governor to do it! A bulldog tenacity, Mr. Fix, that's the spirit that built an empire. "134 Lower Lascar Road, Victoria." We will now go in search of your uncle, Mr. Cominjee. 134 Lower Lascar Road, Victoria. Here, follow that rickshaw, chop-chop! Chop-chop! Here's a pretty kettle of fish. A man trying to run a business, and the door's locked. I wonder what... Ah! Uh, boss man here? Him back pretty soon? I should say the probabilities are strongly against it. - I beg your pardon. Where is Mr. Cominjee? - In Holland, I believe. He amassed a considerable fortune by means I shall not attempt to describe, and has retired to Amsterdam to raise tulips. He might at least have left a card on his door to that effect. The gentleman was quite illiterate, sir, and moreover, he was pressed for time. He retired 10 minutes before the constables arrived. Well, that alters things quite a bit. Obviously, the Princess cannot remain here alone, in Hong Kong. There would seem to be only one alternative. Oh, Mr. Fogg, I know what you're going to say, but please don't send me back to India. If you will excuse me, sir, I agree with the Princess. - You know, she has suffered very much. - Your fears are groundless. I have no intention of returning the Princess to India. She is our responsibility. - And will continue with us to Europe. - Yes, sir. I will escort her to the Royal Court Hotel and find accommodation for tonight. - You will buy the tickets. - Yes, sir. Three cabins on the Carnatic, sailing tomorrow morning for Yokohama. - And don't dilly-dally. - Oh, no dilly-dally. Here, you, follow that ostrich! Giddy-up! Giddy-up! Well, strike me, it's my old friend of the Rangoon. Oh, hello, sir. Excuse me one minute. Three cabins on the steamer Carnatic, please. Yes, sir. There's been a slight change in the schedule, sir. She sails tonight instead of in the morning as orginally planned. - I didn't know, but all the better. - Thank you. That will be all. Well, I... - I trust that you will be comfortable here. - Oh, yes, thank you. I'm sure I will. It's very kind of you to concern yourself about me. Oh, not at all. Since you are temporarily alone in the world, the least I can do is look after your welfare. I'm afraid I must have been a burden. Quite the reverse, I assure you. Your company has been most welcome. I only wish I could express my infinite gratitude. Please, you shouldn't do that sort of thing. Mr. Fogg, why must you be so British? - Madame, I am what I am. - No. You're kind and warm and generous. Ahem. Would you care to join me on the veranda? I understand they serve an outstanding lemon squash. If you wish. - I see you're leaving Hong Kong. - Correct, my friend. - And 12 hours ahead of time. - Well, now think of that. Nothing stops you and Mr. Fogg, does it? Oh, what name do you want on these tickets, sir? - Just copy these. - Thank You. Eh, look here, since we may not see each other again, why don't we have a little farewell drink together? Good idea. Nice and cozy, eh? Over here. Remember, we don't have very much time, sir. I have to get my tickets. Nonsense. We'll send a boy for them. Here, you. You know the Transpacific Guess Steamship Company in Canton Road? - Near post office? - Yes, yes. Send someone over there. Pick up tickets for Mr. Passepartout. - Passeport, too? - Yes. - Thank you, sir. - Well, old boy, what will it be? - A lemon squash. - Poppycock. I said that I'd buy you a drink, and I meant a man's drink. All right, anything you want, but not too strong, please. Eh, my friend and I will have a Hong Kong Snickersnee. - What is that? - It's indescribable. Liquid music. It warms the heart, fires the imagination, broadens the horizon. - What happened? - A local color. The sort of a show they put on for the tourists. Looks very real to me. They're just boisterous children. Ignore them. Now, look here, Passepartout. You've been square with me, and I intend to behave the same. Do you still think I'm an agent for those fellows at the Reform Club? - No, but I don't know what you are. - Then I'll tell you. I'm a professional detective. And I'm in pursuit of a very cunning, very slippery criminal. Who? Phileas Fogg, esquire of Saville Row, London. - What? My master? - The same. Then what do you want from me? Eh, time. Just help me delay him 24 hours till my warrant arrives. All I need is a little cooperation on your part. A little cooperation? Do you think I'd betray Mr. Fogg? I don't care how much money you offer me... All right, all right, you needn't get angry. I don't blame you, in a way. It shows you're a loyal and trustworthy chap, and I respect that. Here. Let's have a little libation on the altar of friendship. And you insult my master. I don't want to drink with you. Rot. You told me where you stood. And I say bravo to a man who sticks to his principles. Here. Confusion to the enemies of the Crown. I can't believe it. Ha. Honorable gentleman feeling better this morning? What are you doing here? Why is the hotel moving this way? What? Steamship, not hotel. You're on board the steamship Carnatic. Carnatic. Yes. We go Shanghai, then we go Yokohama. Oh! Finished? - Where is Mr. Fogg's cabin? - Oh, next door. Oh, but Mr. Fogg not on board. - What about the Princess? - Princess? No, no, no, you come alone. Police, they find ticket in your pocket. Carry you here. You sleep like baby. I betrayed my master. Everything is lost. What about my money? - They robbed me, too. - Oh, it is bad. You not like Yokohama. You not have money, Yokohama not like you. Oh, I betrayed my master. My good man, I realize the Carnatic couldn't wait. The point now is what other vessel can we get? Nothing that could make the voyage to Yokohama, sir. No steam packet, tug, or lighter? There must be something in a port this size. At the moment, not a thing. Ah, good morning, Mr. Fogg. - I'm afraid I don't, uh... - We traveled together aboard the Rangoon. - And my name is Fix. - Ah, yes, Mr. Fix. How do you do? I believe you know my manservant, do you not? Well, very slightly. Why? Has something happened to him? Yes, confound it, the fellow seems to have disappeared. - Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. He's a nice chap. - I think I shall have to inform the police. I shouldn't do that, if I were you. He'll turn up. - Uh, missed your boat, eh? - Yes. Oh, well, there'll be another along in a week. I shall not be here. - No? - Yokohama is my destination. - I shall get there if I have to swim. - Oh. Now we are on a direct course for Yokohama. The Carnatic is bound first for Shanghai. We may arrive in Yokohama the day after her. We're still in plenty of time to catch the General Grant for San Francisco. Very sporting of you to let me share your craft, Mr. Fogg. Oh, nonsense. Anything for a fellow Englishman. I trust your cousin in San Francisco will be better by the time we arrive. - Yes, sir. Poor old Marmaduke. - Thank you. Princess. - Fish, Fix? - Oh. Steady, Mr. Fix. Fujiyama ahead. We'll be in Yokohama by morning. Ah! There's the Carnatic. I imagine that steamship just behind her is the General Grant. Now the only thing missing is Passepartout. The police in Hong Kong said they put him on board. They also said he was penniless. So we may have one clue. The man is a jack-of-all-trades. He's told me a few of them. We might be able to find him by deduction. That is the new science employed by our British police, Mr. Fix. Really? I learn something useful every moment I'm with you, Mr. Fogg. Well, I hope you find your man. Two orchestra stalls, please. The Great Scott. Look. - Passepartout. - Ssst. Master! - Master, what genius to find me. - Merely logic. Now come along. The General Grant is preparing to sail, and we haven't a moment to lose. What a pity. Mr. Fogg has already organized his whist game. Princess, Mr. Fix is a detective. He thinks Mr. Fogg has robbed the Bank of England. Nothing escapes Mr. Fogg. - But... - Mr. Fix won't delay us. We're out of the British jurisdiction now. He's in America. Don't tell me about men. They're all alike. I wouldn't trust the best of them. Well, this here Phileas Fogg, I'm sure he's different. It takes a gallant, adventurous bloke to dash around the world like that. Oh, don't be so soppy. He's probably running away from some housemaid he ruined. Oh, you do have a horrid mind, Cora. I think he's terribly romantic. - They say he's so good-looking. - Oh, rot. I don't care if he's Venus, Adonis and Mercury both. He'll never do it in 80 days. - I bet you 10 Bob he don't. - I'll take that. Here's my money. - Where's yours? - Here it is. Oh! - What's up? - Call a Bobby! I've been robbed. The voice of all our citizens! - I ask you, who will you vote for? - Mandiboy! Mandiboy is our man! Please, Mr. Fogg, let me watch. - Is this a religious spectacle? - Some kind of an election, I would judge. Ah, perhaps they are creating a new president. Well, whatever it is, I suggest that we move over there. Bye! Bye! Bye-bye! Bye! Thank you, sir. Why don't you eat with a fork like everybody else? - Thank you. - You're welcome, sir. Thank you. It's good. For you. - It's good. - Here. Do you like it? - I'll eat it later. - Scrambled eggs. How many times did I have to tell you to stay out of here, you donkey? Come on. Louder, son. Looking for someone? Yes, a small, dark fellow. He wandered in here a few moments ago. Could be almost anybody. Sit down and describe him to me. - I'm afraid I can't. I'm in somewhat of a hurry. - Never be in a hurry. You'll miss the best parts in life. Madame, you don't understand. I'm looking for my man. So am I. Oh, Mr. Fogg, there's Passepartout. Passepartout, put down that chicken! Listen to me. Yes, master. This is a primitive country. We're gonna need some protection. I have this. No, nothing so medieval. A brace of pistols. - Pistols? - Nothing extravagant, mind you. - Oh, no, sir. - You have 47 minutes. - The train leaves on the hour. - I shall be there. I've told you before, do not spoil the natives. Yes, sir. You still in a hurry? I thought the English were calm, dreamy sort of people. Listen, you. Get out and stay out. If I ever catch you in here again, I'll cut you up in a thousand pieces. That won't be necessary, I assure you. I'm just leaving. Ah, an unexpected pleasure to meet you here, Mr. Fogg. Eh-eh, uh, did you have an enjoyable crossing? We didn't see much of you aboard ship, Mr. Fix. Yes, I was a victim of mal de mer, I'm sorry to say. Eh, you won't be lingering in this sort of a hubbub much longer I guess so. - Are you taking the transcontinental train? - Yes, Mr. Fix, the train next one. Are you? Yes. But how's your cousin, the one who was ill? Oh, yes, poor old lady. She didn't trust the doctors here. She's gone on to New York. I thought your cousin was a man. I distinctly remember the name Marmaduke. Angelica Marmaduke. He-he, oh, well, a lovely old lady. For a great smoke, try these, gentlemen. For a good government, vote for Lucius P. Mandiboy. - Thank you, no. I only smoke my own blend. - Oh, you do, do you? You don't want to befoul your lips with a plebeian cigar? No, it's just I'd prefer what my own tobacconist compounds for me. Well, sweet spirits of niter, aren't you the tender bud. Tell me, Percy, who are you voting for? Camerfield or Mandiboy? Neither. I happen to be a foreign visitor, therefore unconcerned about who triumphs for it. How do you ring-tailed sidewinder, if you don't raise my gorge, sir. Yessiree, Bob! I'll be a dad-blamed polecat if you aren't about as ornery specimen as ever I cut my eyes on. What kind of foreigner are you? Maybe a hoochie-coochie dancer? - Unhand that lady, sir. - Why don't you make me? - I will without further invitation. - Why, you dirty... - Oh! - Oh! Let us proceed. - Now what is the delay? - Indians. But they're peaceful Indians. You can tell that by the peace pipes they're smoking. Further down the line, they're not so friendly. Ah! Is the entire American population in the way of this train? Oh, these American trains, quite impossible. Yes, sir. I go, master. She'll never take the weight of this train. We better go back. What's all of fuss here, boys? Can't you fellows run a railroad without'n you stop every five minutes? Oh, that bridge won't hardly hold a locomotive, Colonel Proctor. Why, hang me for a sheep-stealing son of tarantula if you ain't a pack of yellow-bellied milksops. - Am I right, scout? - Oh, yes. Yes, sir, you're right. - No, I ain't chancing it, fellows. - Here, take a snort of this 40-rod. Back up your old teakettle there, and shoot her over at 30 miles an hour. Well... Let her roll! That's the spirit, partner. Bear down on that throttle. Now that's what I call a proper rate of speed. I'll be rattlesnake's uncle. Thought you'd run away, yellow-bellied lime juicer. - Hit a man with an iron bar, will you? - Spades are trumps, I believe. "Spades are trumps, I believe". Oh, my dear Algernon, really. - Be so good as to play. - "Be so good as to play". Gracious. Why don't you play a man's game? Poker, red dog, euchre. Want me to learn you how, Algy boy? or should I learn you how to fight fair? Would you pardon me? Sir, you are an insolent bully, and I demand satisfaction at once. Mind moving into the other car, please? It'll only be a minute or so. Now, don't miss, boys, and damage the woodwork. The company's liable take it out of my salary. Ready, or you want to holler uncle? I'm ready. We will count to six together, turn, and fire at will. - Now? - Now. One, two, three, four, five, six. Take this. Redskins! Thanks, partner. You may be a foreigner, but you're true-blue. Are you all right? I'm all right, but look what they've done to my coat. Hey, the train is running away! They must have got the engineer and the fireman. What do you suggest? Fort Kearney's just ahead. That's where the cavalry is. - But we'll pass right through at this rate. - Somebody's got to stop the train. Aah! One of us must get to Fort Kearney. I'll try. - Oh, poor Passepartout. Not a trace of him. - Everyone else seems to be accounted for. Well, there's no sign of your valet, sir. I'm afraid he's fallen into the hands of the Sioux. It's was a deliberate sacrifice to save the rest of us. - What will they do to him? - Well, the Sioux are pretty merciless. You've heard about their tortures. Colonel, we must send a rescue party at once. Excuse me, mister. I, uh... I know it sounds kind of heartless but we can't hold the train. That's a minor consideration. A man's life is at stake. Any of you men want to volunteer for a raid against the Sioux? - I will, sir! - I will! It's too warm. Master! Master. Don't be blue, folks. Everything is gonna be all right. There'll be a local through here tomorrow. That'll fit you into Omaha the day after. Yes, and lose 24 hours. If we miss our steamship in New York, how are we gonna get to Liverpool on time? I'm darned if I understand you city folks. Always rushing, rushing, rushing. Always thinking about the future. No wonder you have stomach trouble. It's all my fault, sir. You should have caught that train and let those Indians cook me. - Then everybody would have been happy. - No, Balderdash. What I always say is, it's an ill wind that blows no good. Ease off the halyards. Stabiling, man. Look, the train. The train broke down. Master, stop the wind, master. - Contain yourself, Passepartout. - To, to, to, to the left, master. Everything's under control. Those homemade American trains. Goodbye. Oh, well-played, Dennis. I must say you have a natural aptitude for the game. Perfected by four years of practice at Oxford, my dear fellow. I did nothing else. Cost my poor old governor well over £12,000. Worth every penny of it. Hello, Sir Wilmette. Haven't seen you in donkey's years. - Are you staying here at the club? - No. Oh, you're not. - Oh, but you have a house in town, no doubt? - No. - No, then you live in the country, do you? - No. - Uh-huh. Anywhere near London? - No. Hard luck. Good day. Here we are, gentlemen. From the British Consulate, New York. Well, things are looking up. "Phileas Fogg and party presented their passports" "at 2:30 Greenwich time this afternoon." What time did that steamship sail? Here, wait a minute, I have a schedule right here. Here we are. "City of Paris," No, that's yesterday's. Wait a minute. Now, "Cunard, the China. New York, Liverpool." Sail today, 9:00 a.m. Ha-ha, come on. He's missed it by five hours. And not another eastbound vessel for three days. I don't wish to crow, gentlemen, but I seems to feel the crisp crackle of £20,000. I think we better crack that bottle of champagne we've been saving. Right you are. But first, what about a bet or two on the side before this information leaks out? - Aye, we better get over to Mr. Lloyd's. - Yes. Come on. You wish so. Listen! They opened the telegram while I was there. Fogg missed the China. He can't possibly make it now. - Are you sure? - Positive. In that case I'll chance another couple of quid. Here, you take care of things while I slip round the course. Wait a minute. Put down an extra fiver after me. No, gentlemen, not a bit of activity all day. There are just no odds on Mr. Fogg. Well, how can that be? We could barely get in here last Thursday. Oh, yes, sir, very mysterious these things. - You never know from minute to minute. - Gentlemen. I have just received some rather disquieting information about Mr. Fogg. I think you already know Mr. Carmichael, the General Manager of Lloyd's. And this, as you may have guessed, is Inspector Hunter of Scotland Yard. - How do you do? - Yeah. I'm feel this will be very painful to hear, gentlemen. We've just received confirmation of something we've suspected for some time. The man who robbed the Bank of England, and your fellow clubman Phileas Fogg are one and the same. - Of all the ridiculous nonsense! - You don't really believe that. Balderdash. Have you any grounds for making such a charge? We have, sir. Some very striking facts. Coupled with behavior which strongly points to his guilty. - I don't believe it. - Neither do I. You've heard, I supposed, that Mr. Fogg and his party did not sail on the Cunard steamship China. - Yes, yes, well, what of it? - Read them that message, Mr. Carmichael. "At 6:00 a.m. today, our New York office reports" "that trading ship Henrietta departed New York" "with a cargo of cotton, linseed oil, and lumber." "Her three passengers were Mr. Phileas Fogg and party." And the Henrietta's destination, gentlemen, is Caracas, Venezuela. And we have no extradition treaty with Venezuela. - In other words, Mr. Fogg has bolted. - A member of the Reform Club. - My mind rejects the whole idea. - Of course. Surely there must be some explanation for all this. Perhaps so, gentlemen, but the only man who can make it is on the high seas at this moment, bound for Central America. Begging your pardon, sir, we're way off course for Venezuela. - Have you assumed command of this ship? - Why, no, no, sir. Captain, don't overlook the rest of our bargain. - What's that? - The rest of our bargain. Oh, by all means. Go below, tell the engineer I want full steam. - Full steam? - Full steam. As much as she'll take. You're burning her up too fast. You'll never make it. Just steer the ship, Captain. Don't speculate. What's happening? Why are we slowing down? Well, that's it. They just put the last teaspoon of coal in the old scow. It's all finished, Mr. Fogg. You still got a little breeze left, but I don't think it'll get you there in time. Only three more days to go. I still can't believe that Fogg robbed the Bank of England. No British gentleman, having done so, would have the effrontery to set foot in this club. Captain Speedy, I will be direct with you. How much will you accept for this vessel, cash in hand? - Why, this is exceptional... - £5,000? £5,000? What, this deck is made of Burmese teak. Let us dispense with the poetry, Captain. Passepartout, get the bag. Yes, sir. Will that be sufficient? - Oh, she's yours! - Done. Now, as the new owner, I wish to issue my first command. Pile everything that will burn into the stoke hole. The cargo first, of course, that linseed oil. Then the upper decks, masts, tables, chairs, windows, ladders, everything, including the lifeboats. - Is that clear? - The lifeboats? Lifeboats. You heard what the man said. Is that clear? Come on, men. Keep moving. Come on. Oh, no, not her. Not Henrietta! Not her. No! No! No! - The gauges are falling fast. - There's nothing more to burn. How are we faring, engineer? The pressure won't last more than an hour. - One hour? - That's right. Engine room. - Land ho! - Land ho! Yay! Yay! Hooray! Ooh, done, Mr. Fogg. I never exactly made a voyage like this before, - but I can't deny, we got here. - Thanks to you and your men, Captain. After I put you ashore, where do you want me to dock? Anywhere you wish. I have no further use for her, she's yours. Well, thanks for the ship, what's left of it. But, you know, could rebuild this ship... You rebuild her, Captain. I have more pressing matters. Thank you very much. Well, my friends, the end of our journey is near. Eight hours and 42 minutes of the allotted time remain. Our train will arrives at Paddington Station in London at 6:02 p.m., ensuring ample time to proceed to the Reform Club and settle the wager. - Phileas Fogg! Stop that man! - Don't delay, master. Come on. Come on, master. Come on. - What the devil is this? - Are you Phileas Fogg? Of course I am. Have you taken leave of your senses? - Then I arrest you in the Queen's name. - Arrest? On what charge? Of purloining £55,000 from the Bank of England on the 3rd of July. - It's not true. - Silence. You thought you were clever, Mr. Phileas Fogg. Thought you could outwit me, didn't you? Hold him. It's not true. - Take him too. - It's not true, sir. I can't understand it. A most shocking mistake. It's never happened in my career. It would seem, Mr. Fogg, that I owe you an apology. The most terrible thing has happened. The real culprit was apprehended in Brighton. Then I am no longer suspect? No, not in the least, sir, oh, but I would like to tell you that I've never had any personal animosity for you. Heh, on the contrary, you've always been a perfect gentleman and most generous. Heh, it's almost a pity that you're not the real robber. - Heh, you're so daring. - Mr. Fix... Now that you have successfully thwarted me and placed in my path the only obstacle for which I was unable to make provision. I feel I can tell you I have never really enjoyed your company very much. And furthermore, you play an abominable game of whist. Good day, sir. The wager is lost. Come. What a gloomy place. It's so melancholy, so joyless. Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Fogg. I didn't mean to criticize your taste. No, you're right. It is depressing. - Passepartout. - Yes, sir? Look at the clocks. Get in touch with Mr. McMonnies and have them put in order. Right away, this morning. No, not this morning, it's Sunday today. Tomorrow. And make up the spare bedroom for the Princess. - Light a fire, and see to her comforts. - Certainly, sir. And now, madame, if you'll excuse me, I'd like to spend the rest of the day alone. - Oh, Passepartout. - Yes, sir? Turn off the gas in your room. You needn't bother, Passepartout. I'll take this up to him. - He won't eat, madame. He is feeling very low. - Poor man. You know, his whole fortune, all that he risked, everything is lost. - What will become of you, Passepartout? - I can take care of myself. After all, I have a dozen professions, fireman, acrobat, traveling companion. You must eat something, Mr. Fogg. - No, thank you. - Please. You're angry with me, and justly. Good heaven, Princess. Why should I be angry with you? You might have won your wager but for me. You saved my life at the risk of your own, generously, impulsively. And I repaid you by delaying you, involving you needlessly. On the contrary, it is I who owe you an apology to having brought you here to England, penniless. But you must not concern yourself with me, Mr. Fogg. - Your own part... - My dear. Anything that has overtaken me is a direct result of my own folly. I refuse to deceive myself, and I don't like self-pity. Possibly things aren't as desperate as they seem. Well, to be candid, at the moment, they're not particularly promising. - Surely your friends could aid you. - I have no friends. - No relatives? - Not a soul. Then I truly feel for you. I know how tragic solitude can be when one has nobody with whom to share his grief. In my country, Mr. Fogg, it is said that misfortune if shared with another sympathetic spirit, can be borne with resignation. Mr. Fogg... Do you wish at once a kinswoman and a friend? I'm not sure that I interpret you correctly. Will you have me for your wife? Aouda, my darling. Passepartout. Yes, sir? Yes, master? I want you to go to Reverend Samuel Wilson, of Marylebone Parish at once. - Right away, sir. - Arrange for a wedding. - One wedding, sir. When? - Tomorrow. Will that be all right, my dear? - Yes, tomorrow. - Olé, sir! Passepartout. Yes, sir. Curtail the jubilation, if you please, and bring the Reverend Wilson with you. Yes, sir. - Yes? - A wedding. Come with me. - No, I don't think so. - Yes, quickly. It's an emergency. - I'll get my hat. - Quickly. Ahh! Saturday. It's Saturday. - And so many clocks. Couldn't there be just one? - Anything you suggest, my dear. - Master! Master. - How dare you bolt into a room in this fashion, sir? Where is your training? And remove your hat! It's not Sunday, it's Saturday. We have 10 minutes to left, master. What in the everlasting blazes are you jabbering about? It's Saturday! Look for yourself. It's Saturday. Fiddlesticks. The printers must have made an error. You have made the error. We will review your impudence at a later date, sir. In the meantime, allow me to disillusion you. I have kept detailed record of every single phase of our entire trip. We went around the world in 80 days, this is the 81st... It's Saturday. We went eastward around the world, always moving towards the sun. Great heavens! We've crossed the International Date Line. We've gained an entire day. This is it. - This is the 80th day. - It's Saturday. 8:34 and ten seconds. We have 10 minutes and 50 seconds left to get to the club. You wait here, my dear. Come, man, let's go! Cabbie. Cabbie, Reform Club. - Who? - Reform Club. Mind you, governor, it's none of my business, but do you two gents think you'll gonna get into the Reform Club dressed like that? - Drive on, man! - Very good, sir. Whoa! - What's the matter? What happened? - I'm sorry, sir. It's the hiccups, sir. I have them pretty bad, sir. I can't do a thing with them, sir. - Oh, blimey. - Oh, confound the man. It's all right, sir. I drive. - What's the matter with the beast? - It's no good, sir. He can't do it. He'd love to, but he can't, sir. He don't like orders from nobody but me, sir. - Come on, please. - It's no good, sir. He can't do it, sir. No, he won't do it, sir. The devil never sleeps, brethren. Even now as we stand here, he is hurrying some poor soul to his doom tempting him down the path of iniquity. And now, we shall take up the collection. Excuse me. Sir, would you like to contribute something to our cause? Madame, I don't think I have anything. Wait. There's something. A fiver? Oh, please, madame. I'm in a terrible hurry. It's a wager. A wager? Did you hear that, brethren? Our poor, benighted sinner is the very sort I've been telling you about. Don't do it, sir. Don't do it. Don't give in to the Prince of Darkness. Madame, I haven't the faintest intention of giving interfere. Have courage, my boy, to say no. Turn to Hymn 579, everyone, and lift up your voices to save our poorly beset brother. ♪ Have courage, my boy, to say no ♪ ♪ Have courage, my boy, to say no ♪ ♪ Have courage, my boy ♪ ♪ Have courage, my boy ♪ ♪ Have courage, my boy, to say no ♪ That's good! ♪ Have courage, my boy, to say no ♪ ♪ Have courage, my boy, to say no, say no ♪ Good heaven, Ralphs. Why wait any longer? - He's lost the wager. - Of course he has, 20 times over, once he missed transatlantic connection. Steady on, chaps. Play the game. Remember, we're all British gentlemen. - There are still 14 seconds to go. - My dear, Ralph, the man's not superhuman. What do you expect him to do? Pop down the chimney like Santa Claus? I haven't the least idea. I only know that Phileas Fogg is the most punctual man alive. Well, gentlemen, here I am. I trust that I've not kept you waiting. Hello, Fogg. - Hello, Fogg. - Hello, Fogg. - Hello, Fogg. - Great Caesar's ghost! A woman in the club! My dear, I must ask you to leave these precincts at once! - No woman has ever set foot in the club. - Why not? Because that could spell the end of the British Empire. This is the end.
