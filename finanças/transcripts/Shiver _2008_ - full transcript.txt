Easy, easy. Better? Ok then, get up. -Is it night aIready? -NearIy. Remember that we have to go to the doctor. Go on, get dressed. We're Iate. And put on the cream. Gecko, breakfast. Fuck man! Are you aIso bIind or what, you retard? Sorry. -Here. -Retard. What the fuck? You fucking freak. I'II show you. What's the matter, DracuIa? Does the Iight screw you up? Hey, hey! You want troubIes? I'm a bit crazy, motherfucker. Don't Iook at me or I'II kiII you. Do you know what I most hate of the night shift? What? The chicks man, what a difference with the day ones. They couId say the same about us. Yes, but I don't care about that. Look, if I'm given a choice, I'd rather a hot chick than a good chick. Shit, you're good at this, aren't you kid? I kiII monsters to forget that I'm one of them. Hey, some respect, monsters are cooI. I'm going to get change. Fuck you, man! What? No Iuck today? Take it easy, take it easy, I'm Ieaving. And have you noticed the canines, because it Iooks Iike, Iike IateIy they've been growing. A secondary symptom, nothing serious. Good. The bad thing is the test resuIts. The boy's not weII. But you said, that if I Iooked after him... JuIia, this is not the time to bIame oneseIf. But the truth is that the xerodema has progressed. Of course, it's in the initiaI phase, but if we don't manage to attack its deveIopment now, you know what that means: skin transpIants... BIindness, cancer... You smeII good Santi. Thank you, it's the protective cream. Ah! I stuck my foot in it. It stinks. WiII you come to LapIand with me? Of course. AIso, it's aIways night time there. And Father Christmas Iives there, you aIways teII me. Here it is. Don't Iet go of it. JuIia, have you thought about going to Iive somewhere eIse? I mean somewhere with Iess sun. To LapIand? No. WeII you shouId. And you don't need to go so far away. Right here, in the north, there are IittIe viIIages hidden in canyons and deep vaIIeys, with very few hours of Iight a day. Think about it JuIia. It's important. Santi, I won't be abIe to Iook after you aII of your Iife. Either you make an effort or... I can't do it on my own. -It's not easy for me. -And it's easy for me, right? I don't have a Iife, I don't have any friends, I don't have any girIfriends, I don't have shit! And what can I do, Santi. You teII me. Let's Ieave, mum. PIease Iet's Ieave. I can't Santi. I have a job... But Mum, you transIate books, you can do that from anywhere. I can't Iive Iike this. I can't. Let's go far away pIease mum. Far away. Are we nearIy there? We just Ieft. Santi, what are you doing! Santi! There's no sun here. WeII, I think it's here. The IandIord said that he'd be waiting for us. Uy, it's reaIIy Iate. I just stepped on a huge shit! It's caIIed a cow pat. WeII it smeIIs Iike shit. Santi, don't go too far. I don't know what I did with the keys... I thought that they were in my handbag, but I don't know. Santi! Santi, stay stiII, don't move, caIm down. Don't move! Get out of here! Hey! Damned dog... HeIIo, good afternoon. HeIIo, I'm JuIia. Dimas. It's been cIosed up for a whiIe. It smeIIs a bit of humidity. But everything works, eIectricity, water, phone. Everything. Look at the furniture! Are they antiques? They're oId. This way. WeII, there's the kitchen, the Iiving room is over there, and the bedrooms. And there? The Ioft, but I haven't had time to fix it up. It's fuII of junk. I can bring you bread and miIk in the mornings. You don't need to bother. It's no bother. I seII them in my shop. Thank you. I hope you're confortabIe. WeIcome home. Raspa! Again? Raspa! Raspa! What's up Raspa? Who's there? HeIIo, my name is Santi. HeIIo Santi. Very good kids. Sit over there, with Jonas, Iet's see if you can get him to work more. And now, open your books on page seventy five. The earth as an ecosystem. Hey man, your cap is cooI. Mine is shitty. Good morning. Good morning. You're a bit strange, aren't you? Me? No, I'm normaI. The other's are strange. Me too? WeII, I don't know. It's strange that you taIk to me, isn't it? Yes. WeII then. My name is Angela. I'm Santi. And now, what do I do, hey? Now, what the heII do I do? Fabian take it easy... No way! This is the third one. But no more. I swear to God that I'm going to take care of this. Fabian, carefuI with what you put in the forest, some day we're going to have a probIem. It's just another beast... Another beast? Another beast? Do you think that any beast can gut sheep Iike that? Fuck! And watch out what you taIk about around here. We're aII poachers here! AII of us! Is the forest dangerous? You aIways have to respect the forest. HeIIo, my name is Santi. I know. -How's that? -Because I know everything. WeII, I'm going that way. I know. See you Iater. HeIIo mum. Did you have a good day? Yes, very good. And you? I made Iots of friends. No one makes friends on the first day. I Iove you a Iot, mum. Santi! What? I've been in the viIIage today. They toId me that we have to be very carefuI with the forest. Some peopIe put snares and traps there... Mum, they say that to puII our Iegs. Because we're from away. That's why. Santi, this is not the city, and you'd better be carefuI. HeIIo? Anyone home? HeIIo? HeIIo? Good day. Good day. I brought your order, but since no one answered I came up. Santi heard noises in the Ioft and we thought it might be a rat. A rat? Or a woIf. I don't think woIves reaIIy Iike Iofts. It couId be a bird. Sometimes they get in. I couId bring you a cat. No, no cats. Thank you. It's because of Santi. He has aIergies. No, not to cats. WeII, just in case. We don't know. Put that back, Santi. No, don't worry. The peopIe who Iived here before Ieft them. WeII, if you don't want a cat I can bring you some poison or snares. Thank you. -See you Iater. -See you. How funny! What are you taIking about, you're a Iiar. And when I turned around, she was Iooking at me. Come on man, you don't even beIieve it yourseIf. Fuck, I'm teIIing you that it's true. But something Iike what? WeII... I don't know. 'Cause you're a shitty Iiar. Shit, I couIdn't see it properIy, ok? You couIdn't see it, my ass, you couIdn't see it. CouId it have been a woIf? No. Much worse than a woIf. I bet you don't have the baIIs to go to the forest to Iook for it. No, I'm not going. You're coming, the first one. So, anyone eIse? Eh? I'II go. Who's house? And who is Jonas? Right... the pIaystation. AII right... I'II expect you back for dinner. A kiss. Excuse me! Excuse me! Did you want anything? Sorry, my son toId me that he rented you the house. -You're Dimas' father? -Yes, madam. Excuse me, I have to go to the cemetery. They're for my wife. I'm sorry. And your husband? He's... a bit far away. This is not a good pIace to be aIone. It's better to be with someone. I haven't warned my mother, and then she worries. Wait. Do you want to break your Iegs? I bet you'd never seen one Iike this. Watch where you put your feet, wiII you. So, shaII we go back? Maybe it's not here, maybe it aIready went somewhere eIse. Are you sure about the way we're going? Stay cIose together. It's better not to make any noise. I'd go that way, there's more Iight and it's getting dark. Keep going guys. You're a pain, man, come on, keep going, Iet's go. So, shaII we go back? You just keep waIking. The thing is that I have to shit. Are you stupid or what? What do you think the forest is for? -What's up? -I don't know. I've seen something. In the end you'II reaIIy shit yourseIf. -What the fuck is that? -I'm outta here. -You're staying here. -Tito wait. -No, I'm Ieaving. -We have to stick together. No, Ieave me aIone. Let go of me! Tito, shit man. You're going to get it, asshoIe. Tito, Tito. Jonas? Jonas? Tito! Jonas! Jonas. Stop, Stop! Fuck! Santi... Mrs... Mrs, where are you going? Are you Santiago's mother? He can't be under sunIight. CaIm down, we aIready know. He has photophobia. Let go of me. -Who are you? -I'm inspector Cifuentes. What's happened to my son? I want to see him. Your son is fine. But there's a dead boy. Adead boy? I got Iost, and then... and then what? I saw... nothing, nothing. Nothing. -Are you sure? -Why do you insist? This boy couId have shot himseIf, I don't know, an accident. No, it wasn't an accident. Jonas' throat was ripped open. They ripped his throat open and then they Iicked his bIood. What's wrong? -Why...? -She's very upset. And Santi? Why is she Iooking at him Iike that? Leave it aIone, Mum. Leave it. Her son has died... nothing happened to Santi, it's hard for her. Don't take it personaIIy. We just wanted to show how we feeI. I know. Come on, I'II waIk you home. Shit, Iook on the good side, now you're the most famous guy in the viIIage. You're the typicaI mysterious foreigner, right? I don't know. I'd Iike to draw Iess attention to myseIf. Bah! Why? To be the same as the rest? Bah, shit man, chicks don't Iike that at aII. Maybe it wasn't a good idea to come here. Hey! What? What did you do to Jonas, hey? What are you taIking about, Ieave me the heII aIone I swear, I didn't do anything. If you bite me I'II beat you up you shithead See, I toId you, he's got fangs It was you, you vampire! Tito, you saw it. Shit man, pIease teII him. Tito can't have seen it because he ran away, didn't you, Tito? How wouId you know... My father toId me. Do you want me to caII him? Angela, don't listen to this guy, and you, watch out, we'II be watching you Thank you. They're a bit rough here. Yeah. -Who's your father? -A cop. -Inspector Cifuentes. -Ah... I don't think he Iikes me very much either. He's Iike that with everyone. WeII, except for me. Have you been here for Iong? AII of my Iife. Here. What is it? My home number and my mobiIe, but you'd better not caII my mobiIe 'cause there's no signaI. CaII me and we'II meet. Who was that girI? A friend. She's very pretty. I toId you that it wouId just take a second. I stiII don't understand why you want my son's DNA. Just a formaIity, we have to check every possibiIity Every possibiIity of what? Are you bIaming him too? My work is not to bIame. I do what I have to do. AII right, shaII we go? My daughter taIks a Iot about you. She says that you're a good kid. When you get out of high schooI tomorrow you wait for me, aII right? Are you going to caII me some day or what? Are you sure? Your father was at my house. I'm a suspect. And a big one. Don't you suspect me? Hey you, give it back! You guys are the worst! Hey, what's up, did you find it or what? Come on, we don't have aII day. Dickhead, the baII. It's here, I found it. No, Ieave that one. This one. I prefer mine Listen JuIia... sometimes my work isn't very pIeasant, and I have to do things that I don't Iike doing. Your son isn't... The saIiva sampIes that we found on the body don't match your son's. I mean that the DNA test is negative. I hope that this makes you feeI better. I've aIways feIt fine. I didn't think for a second that my son couId do something so horrifying. Right. I understand and... I... CouId I buy you a coffee? I don't drink coffee. WeII a tea. PIease. Hey you! If you don't bring the money for the baII tomorrow, -you're going to get it. -AsshoIe! Tea and coffee. Say hi if you see PaIoma. From you. My ex. She was his girIfriend but in the end she married me. Right. That's the bad thing about viIIages. In the end we aII know each other. I studied, I became a poIiceman, I made it to Inspector, and there you go, after one daughter and a divorce, I'm back. They caII it destiny don't they? I thought that I couId escape mine and Santi's. A new Iife in the countryside... WeII, you're stiII in time to... Thank you. I know that you want to be kind to me and aII that, but you don't have to. Just seeing how they Iooked at Santi at the cemetery, I know that everything wiII be Iike it aIways is. This is a speciaI case. Adead chiId and... in those circumstances. Don't worry. I'm used to it, I'm stronger than I Iook. What time is it? I'm Iate. I have to pick up Santi, and thank you for the tea. A pIeasure. What the heII are you doing? There's something there. There? Shit, back there! Let go of me! Where? Let go of me pIease. Let me go!

Guess who came to see us? Hey Santi! What's up man? You think I'm not tired, Oscar? -It's aIways the same. -I'm going to change, I swear. That's why I'm here. I want to Iook after you, and the boy. -WeII prove it, aII rigth? -AII right, aII right. -Inspector Cifuentes. -JuIia. Oscar, my husband. -Nice to meet you. -Nice to meet you. Is he awake? Two murders in a viIIage where nothing ever happens, and you've been there both times. You're making it difficuIt for me to beIieve in coincidences. -There was something eIse there. -Something? It was... ...Iike on top of Fabian, taIking in his ear. But then it turned around. Did you see his face? Its face and its mouth was fuII of bIood. But was he a man, an animaI, a ghost, what? I don't know, I aIready toId you, I don't remember. Fine. I don't need to know anything eIse. For now. Shit, you didn't Iose any time in getting into troubIe, did you? Mum, saw it. Just Iike I'm seeing you right now. I swear. Santi! Are you aII right? Son of a bitch! You'II see if I catch you! Losers... I'm not going to Iet this situation go any further. I'm going to the poIice tomorrow. Just Iike new. Are you worried? No. Great. Mum? Gecko? Erika HasseI. The daughter of the peopIe who Iived in the house before. It was her. I didn't recognized her at first, but then I saw the photograph and I remembered. She kiIIed him. Ah! What a coincidence, right? You didn't remember anything, and then suddenIy you remember that it was none other than a girI. AgirI that, as far as I know, went to Germany with her parents more than a year ago. I'm teIIing you it was her. She came into my room and took Gecko. Who are you trying to fooI Santi? Why wouId my son make up something Iike that? WeII, if I was invoIved in two murders, maybe I wouId aIso try to bIame someone eIse. What do I have to do for you to beIieve me? Mercedary Mothers... Santi, Santi it's me! What's the matter man? I came as soon as you caIIed me, but this is way out man. Take it easy, I'm here. Das ne-ue wiI-de Mad-chen. -Look, this is in EngIish. -You know EngIish? No, but Iook, Erika HasseI is on the same page as Victor de Aveyron, Kaspar Hauser and KamaIa and RamaIa. And who are they? WeII they're... wiId chiIdren. Kids brought up by themseIves, or even worse, by wiId creatures. I mean, with no contact with human beings. Von Mercedary Mothers of Charity. Look, here's a map of Africa. Africa... I bet she got Iost in the jungIe. Erika's parents Iiven in Africa? Were they missionaries or something Iike that? No idea. There are animaIs here, This Iooks Iike a documentary. Where is MoIIedo? MoIIedo? I don't know, somewhere around here. ChiId HeaIth Home of the Mercedaries of Charity. -What's that, a hospitaI? -I think it's a madhouse. Erika was in a madhouse? I toId you that it was aII right. And you think that they're going to Iet us in, just Iike that? Don't worry, I'II think of something. We shouId teII my father. I bet that he'd heIp. No, it wouId be useIess. No way he wouId beIieve us. WeII, they don't seem dangerous, as in dangerous... And now what? I have a pIan. Your friend is very strange. No man, no, trust him. Right, whatever you say. PIan B. That song... why does it ring a beII? Fuck, shut up! Get out! Get out. Get out, get out! But what are you doing here? I see you won't attend any reason. I bet you'II pay more attention to the poIice. We're in for it now. Damned Erika. And now what? We'II have to catch her ourseIves. Don't even think about it. That girI is a wiId beast, do you understand? Did you know Erika? She was the daughter of some German naturaIists that worked in Africa. She got Iost in the jungIe, and she grew up aIone with the beasts. What did I teII you. Some hunters captured her Iike an animaI, and took her to our mission. Her parents brought her here in case we couId do something for her. She tried to escape every day. She wanted to go back to the jungIe with her creatures. God knows that she never shouId have Ieft the jungIe. We gave her back to her parents, but I knew that we'd never get rid of her. Don't trust Erika. I did. Now it wouId be better if you Ieave and get away, get away from Erika HasseI. Mum! Erika HasseI. Where are you coming from? And him? What's he doing here? Leo came to pick me up at high schooI. At high schooI? Santi, why are you Iying to me? If you don't want to beIieve us... The onIy thing that I want is you to get out of here right now. No, they're not Ieaving. I'm not going to argue with you anymore. You guys, get out! And you, go to your room. Do what your mother says. I'm not taking orderns from a sIot machine junkie. Where are you going? Come back here! Who are you caIIing? Antonio. He's not there. It's impossibIe to get hoId of him. We don't need a poIiceman, I'II find him. On your own? HeIIo, excuse me, I was bringing you the juices. He's Dimas, the IandIord. Oscar, my husband. Stop wit that. Shit, Ieave the torch. What the heII are you recording man. And the others? The ones who died didn't know what they were up against, but we do. I don't. Great pIan. Sprays, aim at the eyes, it reaIIy fucks you up. Be carefuI because the forest is fuII of snares. We shouId have toId my father. FIares. The thing is, we Iight its face, and when its bIinded we fiIm it. What are you doing man? Are you stupid or what? We're going to run out of battery. The most important thing, is to stay together, we musn't separate. If we waIk together it wiII think that we're a pack. What are you doing? I'm not going to make it easy for it. CarefuI, stop. It's true, Fabian has fiIIed the pIace with traps. Angela, Angela. Angela! Don't worry, the girI is from here, she knows the Iand weII. I hope so. Look, see. They must be near. Angela, Angela. HeIp me! Angela! Are you all right? It hurts a Iot. I can't move Angela! Easy, AngeIa, we're getting there. Don't move. CarefuI, carefuI, carefuI. This Iicense pIate is German. My knee hurts a Iot, my knee hurts a Iot. I don't think they came this way. There's a road near here, we shouId keep going and then we'II see. I'II go in front, give me that. Look, the baII. This must be its Iair or something. I think I saw something. Look, Iook, Iook! What is it? They Iook Iike graves. They're the Germans' graves, I bet the kid kiIIed her parents and then buried them. On her own? How can a girI have done that on her own? Santi! Santi! Santi! Hey, watch where you aim. What the fuck! What was that? There it is! That was cIose. We're here! Run, run! Fuck, get it off me, get it off me, pIease, shit. Stop! Shit. Don't puII, don't puII. What's going on? Oh God, God! Santi don't move, aII right? CaIm down! Stop! Don't touch me, don't touch me!

No fucking way, the German's are dead and buried and near here. What are you saying? Ask Santi and AngeIa. They know as much as me. You had to come and screw it aII up. What are you saying? That you've screwed up our Iives! But what are you saying? We don't need you, you hear? Not you, not your friend and not the fucking German's! Mum... Santi... What have they done to you? CaIm down. Santi, Oscar, your father... is dead... Dimas is accusing you. What a son of a bitch! That's a Iie. He's the one who tried to kiII Leo. Leo is in a coma.

The german woman was a different woman. We're not used to women Iike that here. But what's going on? Let go! Let go! Enough! And the girI? What happened with her? My wife begged him not to kiII her, that she wouId take care of her. Poor girI, it's not her fauIt, she said. She thought that she couId get her to forget aII of that, but she didn't know how wiId she was. She ran away, to the forest, and I never saw her again. WeII, it seems Iike it's time for me to Ieave. They're going to kiII me at work. Maybe it's time for us aII to Ieave, right? Santi... No mum. Not yet.
