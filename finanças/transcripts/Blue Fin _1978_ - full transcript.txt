I have had the privilege of serving in her majesty's Royal Navy for a good many years. Our dear lady is quite a connoisseur of the culinary delights the Asians offer. And tuna, I must admit is one of our favourite. And it's thanks to people like you who courageously venture forth in your clippers that we are able to indulge ourselves. I mustn't keep you in suspense any longer. Already I can see some of the young ladies waxing impatient. So why don't we ask them to step up here onto the stage?
