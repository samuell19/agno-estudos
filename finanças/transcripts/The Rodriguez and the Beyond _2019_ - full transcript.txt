In Spain alone, there are about 928,305 people with the last name Rodríguez. It's the third most common last name. In Colombia, it's the most common. In Argentina and Venezuela, the second. And in Mexico and Peru, the fourth. There's a lot of us. Maybe this is why my family is so painfully ordinary. Very dysfunctional, but nice. Also, my I.Q. is unusually high. I could probably skip this year in school if I wanted to. I could probably start high-school even. Or as they call it in Mexico, la prepa. But only I know that. And now you do too. I'm going to the bathroom. I don't spend much time studying, but I always get an A. My mom started to notice. Sorry. But this story I'm going to tell you is not about me. It's about how wrong I was to think that my family was pathetic because it was so ordinary. Good morning. That's my dad. He's about to have a very complicated day. Wake up, honey. I left out the suit for the meeting with the Dutch! He used to work in banking. But one day he met these Dutch people that convinced him to change his life. So he bought a hardware store. Why did I get myself into this? I was fine at the bank. You hated that job. You'll be fine. You're just anxious. Breathe. The Dutch are visiting today to see how things are going. That used to be a money-pit until he started doing secret deals and now its profitable. You only have one mother. And mine is the best. She's a psychologist, and Mexican. She came on vacation and then stayed. If she hadn't fallen in love with my dad, she would've done something big. My older sister. She may look very posh and all, but she had a hippie phase. She only wanted a dog and a flute for Christmas. My parents don't know she has a salamander tattooed on her butt. I've seen it. Although it looks more like a lizard that was ran over by a car. My little sister. We thought she was autistic, but now she's just labeled special. She likes that bird more than dolls. And she likes money more than I like soccer. She's... strange. At this point in our story, I had no idea of what was to come. No one could've guessed. -Mom... -Yes? When will Grandma die? Gabriela, please! You should never ask those question. How old is she going to be, Dad? Seventy three, but don't tell her I said so. Who cares? She won't know. -Alejandra, yes, she will, OK? -OK. Mom, is Grandma crazy? -No. -Is it Alzheimer's or dementia? OK, kids, that's enough! Stop it, right now! Today's your grandma's birthday, OK? That's all there is to it! We're going to buy her some flowers. And we're going to play our happy song. So Dad can relax. -No, Mom, please! -Yes, we will! No, Mom, not again! Can I go on the front? Can I go on the front? Sure, come here! We're not here to play It won't make me crazy A living enigma... Let's go, Daddy! She understands me She sizes me up It turns on... Come on, Daddy! Flirts Then disappears And I don't know Where she goes, where she lives And everything's wrong And it's always the same But what do I know? I'm not a detective I have a terrible time My girl of smoke My girl of smoke Where's Grandma? Congratulations, Grandma! Alejandra! Alejandra! I'm Gaby, but it's fine. -Mom. -Son! -Congratulations! -Thank you so much! Go say hi. So handsome! -Congratulations, Grandma. -Alejandra, sorry. It's just that... Time flies by, I still see you as if you were her age. -Congratulations! -Don't bring me any flowers! Why don't you want me in your house? Cristina may have been a snob, but she has nothing on her! As a woman and as a person! Grandma, that's Mom. I'm that Cristina. The snobby Cristina. You give them to her. He looks just like his grandfather! And so smart too! Not like your dad. But don't tell him I said that. Dad, she's worse every day. She seems happy, and that's all that matters. -Oh! -What's wrong? My Rubik cube! Go get it, honey. -We'll wait in the car! -Hurry up, Nico! -Grandma, have you seen my Rubik Cube? -Looking for this? I took it so I could speak to you alone. Sit. Your grandfather gave it to me before he died. He left it for you. He said it was a secret. Why didn't you give it to me before? I was supposed to give it to you when you turned 15. But since my brain isn't getting any better, it's best if you keep it. Open it when you're 15. But not before, understood? Nico... Grandpa said you couldn't tell anyone about it. And that includes your parents. Yes. Hi, Boss! Did you hide all the cold cuts and wine at the neighbor's warehouse? Yes, but I had to give him a few things. Otherwise, he said he'd tell on us. That damn Paco. He's a terrible neighbor. -Boss... -Yes? Boss! I'm sorry to bother you. I'm so nervous, my mouth is dry. No, no, no, no, no. You aren't going to ruin this. How are you going to ruin it? We've been practicing for weeks. Just pretend like you know it all. With conviction. I'm here for you. -I'll cover for you-- -Rodrigo! Martín! Have a good Vatio day! Have a good Vatio day! Have a good Vatio day! He's asking how many brands we carry. Say whatever comes to your mind. Twelve. Say a phrase that ends in euros. I'm shitting my pants. Euros. Rodrigo, where's the wine and the cold cuts? We can't find them. Yes, of course, this way, please. What's up, Nico? I wanted you to come home-- No, Eduardo is staying home, he needs to study for a test. Yes, that's why I came, I thought we could study together. He's my best friend, and I'm good at math. That's true, I heard you're going for upper courses. If you're going to study, we don't mind. Right, sweetheart? Yes, go ahead. Nicolás! Tell your dad I also got a company car! You told him last week already. Nico, what's wrong? What's wrong? It's something serious. Very serious. What's that? It's called a VHS. My grandfather left me a message recorded in here. My dad still has an old video player. Hello, Nicolás. If you're watching this, that means you're turning 15 today. Congratulations. But today's not your birthday. And I'm not 15. Shut up and listen. I asked your grandmother to leave you this message. I have something important to tell you. It's a secret only you can know. I left something very special hidden in the garden It's buried near the tallest tree. Nicolás... listen well. You can't go looking for it. I left it there in case of an emergency. What type of emergency? I'm sure you're wondering, "what type of emergency?" One you can't even imagine. But once it happens, you'll know it. The coin I left you is very important. Keep it safe. It will only work once. I love you, Nicolás. Be happy. That's incredible! What coin? It came with the video. It must be a gift from my Grandpa. Swear to me we'll look for it together when we're 15. What's with you? Are you still watching Dora the Explorer? Follow me. Ale, can I eat last yogurt in here? No, it's Gabriela's. Are we playing against Moya at the Paddle tournament? -I'm going with Beatriz. -Beatriz? What about me, Bosco? Why can't I play with you? Ale, you can't even play that well. -You know I'm very competitive. -Sure. Also... -Your age. -Again with my age, Bosco? You weren't complaining before. -It's all about winning. -Winning, I see. And Beatriz is the best at that. Right? Beatriz is a flirty idiot that always wears a push-up bra so her little lemons look like actual breasts. Where's my yogurt? No, no. This was yours? Ale, why didn't you tell me? I told him, Gaby, I swear. Fine, I'll buy you an entire package next time. OK? Bosco. I have one word for you. Alopecia! Bosco, it was just a joke. Where are you going? She's just a girl. Bosco! Bosco! -What? -Where are you going? To Starbucks. Are you coming? I can't, I have to wait for my mom to show up. But if you give me just a moment-- No, I'm leaving. I'll come with you. Hey bud, do you have a shovel? A shovel? What do you need a shovel for, Nico? Alejandra, when my mom comes back, I'll tell her you just left. That you tried waiting for her. She's always late. She'll feel guilty. Bosco! Are you stupid? Sorry! How old were you when your grandfather died? I think I was seven. My grandmother always told us weird stories about Grandpa. So weird, they were hard to believe. Oh, no! Now we'll need a shovel. It's a box! Open it, Nico. Is it a weapon? No, no, no. It's the handle of an old fridge. Your grandfather played a prank on you. Wait. There's an old fridge in my basement, it's been there forever. And you know what? It's missing a handle. That's amazing! The handle fits! But your grandfather said it was only for emergencies. What if something bad happens when you open it? We'll find out soon enough. What's in it? Nothing. My grandfather must be laughing at me. What about the coin? It's probably a chocolate coin. At least it was fun. PLANET MAKTUB ARTEMIDIS GALAXY POPULATION 7.5 MILLION. THE LEGEND OF MAKTUB Get out! THE NEW PHOTOGRAPHIC SENSATION FIVE POSES. Hi, how are you? Hi. Sir, the alarm has been confirmed. The alarm? Are you sure? I assure you. The coordinates of Earth have been confirmed. Are you doctor Cristina Rodríguez? Yes, but if you need to be seen, you need to make an appointment. -Of course. You don't know me, right? -No. I'm... Pedro Solas. -I'm the Minister of Finance. -What did he do? Is this about the hardware store? What did my husband do? No, no, no, please. -I'll only take a minute of your time. -Oh. -Yes? -OK. You see, my brother-in-law is a doctor. He said you could help me. -Yes. What kind of problem do you have? -Hallucinations. -OK. -I've been seeing strange things lately. -It must be due to stress. -Yes, I'm sure that's it. -Will it go away? -Yes, they're usually temporary. There's one more thing, Doctor. No one can know I came to see you. -Of course. -Would you be able to see me after closing time? Yes. It would have to be after seven. -You don't know how much I appreciate it. -Please, it's my pleasure. Thank you, thank you. PLANET MAKTUB: MILITARY SPACE STATION Son... -How many countries are in Asia? -48. No, that can't be. Oh, yes, 47. That fits. They always forget about East Timor. I don't know why, it has a population of over a million people. Due to 2002 emigration Nico... Son... don't you get bored in class? Mom, please, don't start. I'm going to bed. -Hello. -Hello, Cristina, darling! Hi, Natalia. I'm going to the club tomorrow to play golf with some friends. That's so nice of you, Natalia! -Yes, I'd love to-- -Oh, I'm sorry, honey, but there's already four of us. I'd like to know if I can leave Edu at your place for a bit. -Oh. -He'll come with Brisila, my dog. By the way, Samuel is fixed, right? Brisila is in heat. Yes, she won't have a problem with Samuel, he's fixed. And Edu can come any time. Bye. Edu's mother is so annoying. His father is even worse. I hope that BMW blows up and I'm behind him to see it. Bosco, let me be your paddle partner. Ale, you're so insistent with this. But Beatriz is insufferable. She is, but she's the best at paddle. I don't get it. Bosco, is something going on with her? -Don't start, Ale, please. -"Don't start?" Answer my question first. It's not funny! Don't touch me. Answer me. You haven't answered yet. Let me go. Listen to me. -Is there something going on with her? -Don't start! Stop it! No, no! No! -Come, give me a kiss. -Listen to me. -I only like you. -I hope so, -because if you're lying-- -Don't start-- Why can't we--? Is he bothering you? No, no, no, no! He's-- Are you stupid, or what? You're an idiot! Calm down, Bosco, calm down. Do you think I'm stalking her? What's wrong with you? -Stop, stop. -She's my girlfriend! Don't you know what that means? -We're just discussing things! -Stop it! Don't you know what a girlfriend is? Of course not! With the way you look! -My parents! -Get out of here, asshole! Alejandra? Get inside. Now! What's going on here? Good evening. Sorry, he was trying to bother your daughter, but it's over. No, no, not at all. I was trying to help her, I thought he-- -Get the hell out of here! -Sorry. Bosco, good night. Good night. Sorry. Proceed. EARTH Alejandra! What? First of all, he's older than you. And now turns out he also doesn't respect you? -Bosco isn't usually like that. -Oh, not usually? What did Bosco do so that the neighbor had to help you? Nothing! He had a little bit to drink and he was acting stupid! -It wasn't a big deal! -Drunk? We've had enough of this! Oh, now you want us to be quiet? Wait, Rodrigo. There's an earthquake! There's an earthquake! Nicolás! Gaby! Nicolás! Gabriela! An earthquake! Oh, thank God, honey! Oh, no, Gabriela! Gaby! OK, it's over. It's over. It's over, right? It was really strong, right? It was probably a seven on the Richter scale. Let me turn on the T.V. and see what they said. -What? -What's wrong? Relax, I'm not going to hurt anyone. Who the hell are you? What are you doing here? You should ask that to your father. What are you saying? How did you get in? Call the police! This dog is going to rip your leg apart! Nice doggy. -Hello? Hello? Please-- -Come, come. Ma'am, please don't use that communicating device. Get out of my house right now or I'll cut you! Why don't we all calm down? -Call the police, honey! -I am! They're not answering! -Oh! -Boy! -Sorry. -I told you to call them, not throw it! Rodrigo, I didn't throw it. Sorry, I'm a little rusty at it. Let me try something else with the knives. GOD! You're like Tyrion in Game of Thrones! I don't know who that is, Nicolás. How do you know our names? Do me a favor. Come to the basement with me, it'll be easier to understand. -Follow me. -No. No, no, no. Let's go. Let's go. Stay calm, OK? Look, family. I'm here because of that fridge. It made this basement into a cosmic door to another dimension. Are you f--! Wait a minute, you Argentinian phony. I am no phony. And I'm not Argentinian either. -Where are you from then? -From another planet. Another planet? Listen... I don't know how you did that with the knives. But this is over, I'm calling the police! -Right now! -Yes. And if you try to stop me, I'll-- My wife will put you on a choke hold, OK? Relax, he'll be right back. Good evening, Rodrigo. Good evening. Dad, what happened? Honey? He just realized I'm not lying. Follow me. All of you. What's going on? -What the...? -Where are we? I'm... Now you understand? -What's going on? -What? What is this place? Welcome, Rodríguez family. I'm Pilar. Doctor Pilar. Wait a minute. If our house is this big, we should have it appraised again. Gabriela, this isn't your house. It's not even your planet. -What? -Planet? -Wait. But... -What? -What do you mean? -Where are we? You're in Maktub, planet Maktub. -Mom. Where? -Planet what? I'm sure you have lots of questions, but there's no time to answer them now. Please, follow agent J.J., OK? Where are you taking us? Please, don't be so distrustful. Everyone, follow me. Please, go with him. Ale, Ale! My God, Nico! -Gaby, look at that! -Which one? -Stay together. -Yes, yes. -So? -They're fine. Except for the dad. Are you still upset? I already apologized. Good evening. Let me tell you one thing. To be able to work here, I can't see or hear anything. If I see something strange, what do I do? I stay quiet. It's been 12 years, and not even my mother knows I work here. But I need to ask this. Why is there a family here, this late at night, and in pajamas? They're on a tour. -A tour? -Yes, they won a contest... from some cookies. A tour of a secret military installation, from buying cookies? -Yes. -Oh, no, no... -We're here. -What's going on? What's going on now? -It's not working. -Fix it then. Fix it! Come on. It's broken. What are we going to do now? Manuel will fix it. Where's Manuel? Above us. Call him. -What? -My throat is... Manuel! Manuel! -Manuel! -Stop, stop, stop! Listen. I'm coming! We're here. Enjoy your cookie tour. Follow me. Family. Family. EARTH-MAKTUB Sit down, please. Wherever you want, but quickly. We only have 15 minutes left. There are two similar worlds. One is Earth, where you live. The other one is Maktub, which is here. How do we not know of its existence? Exactly. The people at NASA must be blind. Fortunately, NASA still doesn't know of our existence. It's better for everyone that way. Once in a while, these worlds connect with each other. Through a bridge, wormholes, or cosmic doors. But it's imperative that no one goes from one world to the other. If more than 20 people go from one world to the other, a tragedy would occur, something that would completely, irreversibly, change the cosmic order. And this would happen. EARTH This! EARTH This! EARTH I'm sorry, Doctor. EARTH -That was crappy. -What? -It looked cheap. -Oh, yes. It would be a cosmic apocalypse. Take this with you. This is all very interesting, but... what are we doing here? Lights! PLANET MAKTUB OFFICIAL DOCUSERIES MARCH 28, 1953 I'm General Ernesto Carraqueño. I'm the Commander of the army of Maktub. This information is meant to accredit and document what happened in March of 1951. During that fateful year, wormholes started connecting Maktub with Planet Earth. And 223 inhabitants of planet Maktub managed to cross to Planet Earth, in search of a different life Which meant that soon enough, both worlds would cease to exist. In Maktub, we prepared for the worst. In a last-ditch attempt at survival, we sent our best agent, Jerónimo Rodríguez. -That's Grandpa! -That's my dad! No, no, no, this is insane! Miraculously, he managed to capture all the 223 Maktubians, narrowly avoiding a cosmic apocalypse. He came back as the biggest hero in the history of our planet, and was given an honor medal by our president. He was offered anything he wanted. But agent Rodríguez only asked for one thing. He wanted to remain in Earth. During his short stay over there, he had fallen in love with an inhabitant of Earth. -That's Grandma! -My mom! -That's Isabel! -My grandmother. In order to prevent sending the wrong message, we faked his death in a vehicular accident. In exchange, Agent Rodríguez promised to forget about planet Maktub, forever. However, we found out that Agent Rodríguez... betrayed us. The president! Are you the son of Agent Rodríguez? Yes. Take those glasses off. Yes, I look a lot more like my dad when I don't have them on. That looked like it hurt. Madame President, what was that slap about? Your father betrayed us. All of Maktub. What did Grandpa do? He left the cosmic door open in case he wanted to return. That wasn't part of our deal. It had very serious consequences. I agree, but that had nothing to do with us. True. Nicolás, would you like to tell your parents what you did? What did you do, Nicolás? In our garden. There was a box. I saw it, I swear. You're such a snitch. -Nico, what did you do? -What did you do, Nicolás? I found a box buried in the garden. -Yes? -There was a handle inside. So I put it on the fridge at the basement. I thought it would fit. Why are you always getting into trouble? -Nothing happened, Dad. -Nothing? Are you blind, or what, Nico? Look at where we are now! Nicolás, unbeknownst to him, opened a cosmic door at the basement of your house. And now we're in serious trouble. Wow, we would've never known if you didn't tell us. So now, all the inhabitants of Maktub finally realized that agent Rodríguez never died in an accident. And why is that so bad? Tell him, Doctor. Because of that door that stayed open, we've been stuck in 1951 ever since. Sixty years! Sixty years of falling behind! Oh, no, no! See your cellphone? It's small, right? It's an iPhone. Soldier. This is mine! And how could we fix all of this? We need to find the door your father opened here in Maktub that connects to the basement in your house, and then close both of them. -OK, OK. -Excuse me. Could I use the restroom? I really have to pee. Soldier, take him. Get back! Get back! Nobody moves, or I'll shoot! He's crazier than his dad! We're going back home, you can all forget about the Rodríguez family, -and we'll all be happy. -Dad? Dad! Rodrigo, please, honey! Calm down! Honey, don't tell me to calm down right now. Let's go back home, and that's it. -One... -What did you shoot me with? -...two... -You stupid short... ...three. My God! We need to tell your dad, but very calmly. Calmly, otherwise he'll get too stressed. -Especially coming from you, Nico! -Yes, I know. I'll go wake him up. -He's coming! -He's coming? Calm down, relax. Good morning, family. Good morning. Cristina, I don't remember what you cooked last night, but don't do it again. I had nightmares all night long. I woke up tired. What's wrong? Honey, have a seat, please. Come here. Honey, that nightmare wasn't a dream. It really happened. What? And one more thing. -Your daughter, Gaby-- -Dad, you won't believe it! We have powers! Gaby, disappear! Nico! Don't be so tactless! Look at Dad! I can't believe this! It's true, Dad! Gabby, go ahead, appear again! I don't feel like it. You're stupid! You're going to pay for this, Nicolás Rodríguez! I'm going to the bathroom. Nicolás! There you go again! You did the opposite of what I asked! Look at your dad now. He's in shock! In shock! Honey, calm down. Turn around, please. You're in shock. Take a deep breath in. -You're in shock. Take a deep breath. -It's four in the afternoon. Yes, but breathe in-- But I was supposed to meet the Dutch people this afternoon! What are you talking about, are you serious? Your daughter is invisible, Rodrigo! And Félix is living in our basement. -The Argentinian short guy? -Yes! And he wants to talk to us. -Calm down first. -Let's go! Relax, please! -Hello. -"Hello"? You drugged me. I want you out of my house. I'll call some construction workers to close in this basement. -So you, get out of here. -Look, Rodrigo. What part are you not understanding? Do you think a construction worker can close a cosmic door? I don't know! -Did you know my daughter is invisible? -He knows. Honey, sit. -Félix... -Yes. Can you explain to him the thing about the powers? Because of the cosmic door, some members of your family will have unusual abilities. Like your daughter now. That's great. You haven't even heard the best part. Just wait, it gets worse. If someone on Earth notices this, by orders of our President, we'll have to extradite you all to our planet. Did you hear what he said? We'll be extradited to his planet! No! No, no, no! I'll never allow that! It's of the utmost importance that no one suspects that another world exists. So you must always be very discreet. As soon as we find and close the door your dad left in our planet, everything will go back to normal. MAKTUB TERRESTRIAL CONTROL AGENCY Put those bracelets on, never take them off. They'll help you. It has four colors. White means everything's okay. If it turns green, someone is suspicious of you. If it turns blue, the damage is almost irreversible. And if it's red, say goodbye to Earth. This works just like the bracelets. -So you're always watching us? -Of course. We got the message. You need to learn how to use the rifle. Oh, no! I want no weapons in my home! -No, no! -Wait, Rodrigo. -Honey, let go of that. -No! -No, Rodrigo, please! -Look... -Where's my dad from? -What? My dad. Your father-in-law. Where is he from? From Mexico? -No. -What? He's not? He's from Earth! And yours is not from Earth! So I'll use this rifle. Show me how to use it. Honey, I don't want you handling that! What are you doing? Did you finish fighting? A guy named Rungen Zelig did this to me. He's a very dangerous fugitive, he's been on the run for over two years. He's capable of detecting wormholes like the one right here. Your dad jailed his uncle and killed his father. Nothing would bring him more pleasure than to kill you all, especially now that he knows that your father didn't die back then. OK. -You can keep it. -There. This is an X77 of the highest caliber. But you don't point it like your weapons. All you have to do is wish for it to shoot, with your minds. That old suitcase. Do you like it? I do, she doesn't. Look at this. A single beam will be enough to send that bastard back to my planet. By the way, if the bracelets start beeping, it means danger is near. But you'll protect us, right? Of course. I'll stay here until everything is over. -I'll be your guide. -OK, thanks. Did my mother know about this, by the way? She never said anything. She took the secret to her grave. -Isabel is alive. -What? We didn't know that. Why didn't you tell us? I have to let them now immediately. We need to bring her here! No, no. Here? My mom lives at an assisted living. She's fine. Don't you think they'll want to kill Rodríguez's wife? Besides, it's quite possible that she also has some type of ability. I'll call them. So if I think of someone, it'll just shoot itself? Cristina, you're a psychologist. You can control your thoughts. Breathe. The last thing I'd want is to shoot this gentleman. Don't think about it, don't. No! Oops! "Oops?" What? I'm sorry. I mean... I thought: "Cristina, don't think about it." But I thought about it, only out of curiosity. I swear! Let go of it, honey. Let go of it. Oh, my God! I eliminated him. No, you didn't eliminate him! You killed him, honey! Don't say that! Don't! No, no, no. They'll think we did it on purpose! They'll deport us! No, no, no, no! Let's call them. I'll call and explain everything. Oh, sure, of course. Go ahead, call them. -Yes. -What number are you going to call? 911? We don't even know how it works, honey! Careful, they're heavy. Could you bring them inside? I get paid to bring them outside, not inside. -Please. -I'm sorry, I'm in a hurry. Hi. Hello. I wanted to apologize about last night. Don't worry, it wasn't your fault. Your boyfriend is somewhat of a jerk. He had a little too much to drink, that's all. Got it. That's what my mother said about my father when he'd drink. Can I help you with the boxes? Yes, please. You know what? Don't worry, I'll take care of it. -I'll take them. -No, they're too heavy. Wow! See you later. Do you weight lift? It's my genes. I have Basque grandparents. -What's that? -Hold on, I need to talk to you guys. Dad, these boxes are for you. What? How can you carry all that? -They're not heavy. -Yes, they are. Are they really that heavy? He's going to think I'm a donkey and not a girl! Are you kidding me? You have powers now, and not me? -What about me? -I don't want them! You're just an ordinary earthling. And you're going to regret throwing flour at me! It's so unfair! Gaby, Gaby! Where are you going? I'm going to go see Félix. Don't you want to play with my lipstick? The one you like? -It's in my dresser, by the bathroom. -Fine! Gabriela, please! -Don't do that, honey! -Fine. What's going on? Félix is gone. -Where? -Why would he leave? I thought he was here to protect us. -Yes. -Your mother... What? She eliminated him. -What? -How? Yes. It was an accident. I shot him with his own weapon. What are we going to do now? -We have no idea. -But we do know one thing, it's important that we don't raise any suspicions. Now we know Gaby and Alejandra have powers. Why is that so bad? It's very bad! If anyone suspects or sees us doing strange things, they'll extradite us to their planet. -What? -Yes! -No. -Yes! These bracelets they gave us will help. If someone near us starts suspecting, it'll change colors. If it's white, it's fine. Green means someone is suspecting. Blue is very bad. -And red-- -Red means it's over. This thing does the same. -No. -They're watching us. I think it's best if we... if we all stay inside the house today. No way, I told Bosco I was going to play paddle with him. At the golf club? Shut up! This is all your fault! I also have to go to the store this afternoon. Besides, we need to go get my mother. -Grandma? -Grandma? But she's crazy. Alejandra! Grandma also has powers, we can't let people suspect her. Did Grandma know about this? No, no, no, Grandpa never told her. I mean, I don't think so. I'll go get your mother, and you go to the store. We'll come back right away. -You stay with your brother. -Why? Yes, Alejandra, or they'll extradite us from planet Earth if they want to! Understood? Understood? Fine! Good morning, Radio 75.4, your favorite radio... Everyone's talking about it, agent Rodríguez. Turns out he didn't die. AGENT RODRÍGUEZ DIDN'T DIE IN AN ACCIDENT! Boss. Good afternoon, Boss. Fresh fruit, the one you like. Boss. They didn't kill the bastard! Agent Rodríguez didn't die. He stayed on Earth. And he kept a door in his own home! What are we going to do? They must be going crazy trying to find the door connecting to his house. There's no time to lose. Tell him I need to talk to him. That wasn't our deal. Did I ask for your opinion? Go now, unless you don't value your life! Idiot! And tell him not to fail me. So the 1951 enigma has been solved. Agent Rodríguez caused it. History won't idolize him anymore. Vengeance is near, I can almost taste it. Where are we going? -Our house. -We thought you could stay with us for a few days. Who are you? It's Cristina. I see. Grandma, you're not crazy, right? Gabriela! Grandma, look what I can do. Don't you dare, Gabriela! I'll punish you for a whole month! A whole month, no... You're going to get it this time! That's it, you're punished! Teo, Teo! No, no, no, please. How could you do this to me? Those Dutch men came and you weren't here! I know, but I... OK, whatever. What did you do? What did you tell them? They spoke to me in English and I didn't understand. Oh, no, please, no! But... I, Teo Pineda, even though I failed English four years in a row, remembered a phrase that worked out for us. Which one? That your mom is sick. Very good. Yes, Teo! -That's great! -So, Boss. He was really affected by the news of your mother. What exactly did you tell him? -That your mom was sick. -No, no. In English. -That my mother died? -No, she's sick. No! Dead means she died! No, please! Why? Why? Why is the universe trying to drive me insane? -I can't! -Boss! -Boss! -What? -You're red! -Where? Your forehead, your ears... Boss... your butt. And here we go! Relax, I'll call an ambulance. Two? No... Wait a minute, wait. Eh, Teo, Teo, Teo, Teo... -You're not... -Of course. Do you think those Dutch guys would give a franchise to anyone? It's been years of training. And now I'm great at it. I'll shine whenever I want. Thank God! -Does that mean I will-- -Yes, one of these days. One of these days. I hope it lasts. Nico. I'm leaving and coming back before Mom and Dad come back. Keep it to yourself. Understood? -Oh, sure. -"Sure"? What? A 12 year old kid against the dangers of a cosmic door. -I must be going crazy. -Say whatever you want, but this is all your fault. Besides, Samuel is here to protect you. Wow! Are you kidding me? Even Samuel has powers now? What do we do now? Good luck. I'm leaving. What now? Hey. Edu. She's in heat. Thankfully, Samuel is fixed. Edu, it's best if you leave. Where? They left me alone and I don't have keys. Not again. How is he doing that? Code blue! Code blue! Control one! You see that ball? It's blue. And that's not good for me. It means you're scared. Félix, help them! Remember the times we wanted to have powers? See extraterrestrials? Be a superhero? All that is possible now, but you need to calm down. I don't know how, but you need to calm down. Close your eyes. Breathe in. Good, good. Oh, thank God! But that was close. -Great. -What's going on, Nico? That fridge in our basement. It's a door to another dimension. My grandpa... was from another planet. Yes. Doctor, this keeps changing colors. Gaby, are you stupid, or what? I'm not color-blind, sweetie, what's your problem? Don't you think I can see it? I'm sick and tired of your calls! Leave me alone, OK? Thank you. -Mom. -Wait a minute, honey. -Mom, Mom! -Stop it, Gabriela! OK, but Grandma is floating. I feel so light. Oh, I see. Here. Help me with the bags. Let's go home. Let's go. This way, hurry. She's gassy, I'm sorry. -Hi, Juan. -Hey, Alejandra! -Hi. -Are you going to play? I don't know. Have you seen Bosco? He was eliminated on the first round. He probably went to get a drink. With Beatriz. -Thanks. -No worries. Bye. So Beatriz was great at paddle? Ball? Throw it, please! Sorry! Bosco. Hi, Ale. -Hey. -Don't touch me. You're a bastard! It's not what it seems. Don't get so mad, girl. Calm down. -Calm down? -You know what? When you get so mad, you can see your vein right here. It looks awful on you. We don't know how this radio works. There's a rifle too, we can't use it. My mother killed Félix with it. Really? Your mom? Not on purpose. Nico, son, are you--? Edu, Edu, how are you? This is my new hobby. I collect radios. I had to tell him. What did you say? -Are you crazy? -It's OK, he can control his emotions. They're going to extradite us, Son! Oh, my God! I'm going crazy! -Don't you understand--? -Dad! What? You too? Yes! I start shining when I'm upset. Just your head? No! Oh, no! Son, please, I'm asking you, don't act on your own again! You see this? This is because of Edu, understood? Wait, sir. There you go, Mr. Rodríguez. Looks like you shine. I think that's great. Make two copies and leave one at the cabin, please. -J.J., where's the doctor? -What's going on? Apparently, there's a prisoner inside the Earth cell, he keeps screaming he's an agent. -Inside an Earth cell? -Yes. Let me go check on it. No, no, I'll do it. Don't tell the Doctor, she's already nervous as it is. It's probably a false alarm anyway. -Sure. -Peter. That's an order. Hello. I told my parents I'd stay home to watch my siblings and they got here before me. What's with that box? You always have it with you. You know? We've been neighbors for nine years, and it's the first time you ask me a question. -I play the saxophone. -You're a musician? It helps me express myself better than my own words. -Can I help you get up? -Yes, please. Try not to look, OK? There you go. -That's it. -That's it? Wow! Thanks. What am I doing with this bags? If I take them from you, you'll start levitating. How was the supermarket? Alejandra! Hi, Mom. Hi, Grandma. -Where's your sister? -Huh? Your sister! Upstairs. Oh, Edu! Hi, honey. Sweetheart, I think Edu should go home. I don't have keys and my parents won't come home for a while. How many grandchildren do I have? He's Nico's friend, Grandma. Hi. Edu! Nico, I think Edu should go home. What? Am I diseased? I have nowhere to go! Don't worry. Nicolás already told everything to Edu. What? -Nico, are you stupid, or what? -My God, Rodrigo! -You always screw up! -Calm down. I won't get upset. Apparently, I also have powers. You too, Dad? Yes, if I get upset, I start shining. -No! -Yes, it's kind of useless, to be honest. Mom, what are you doing with those bags? No, don't take--! -Grandma! -Grandma floats! -Oh, my! -Yes, Son? Yes, Grandma is part of the weird power club. Give her the bags. Here! Grab them. Mom, your bracelet is green! -Oh, yes. -Mine is too! The ball! Yes. But that's weird, everyone here is part of the family. It's Edu! It's OK, calm down. Grandma floats. It's fine. Hey, Edu. By the way, where's Samuel? WHY ALL THE INTEREST? AREN'T YOU...? CAN DOGS WALK ON CEILINGS? EVERYTHING'S POSSIBLE AROUND HERE, SWEETIE. AND YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL. Samuel? He's been screaming he's a special agent since he got here. Talk to the agency. I know you. Who are you? -Do you know him? -No. No, no, no. He's lying. Don't let him talk to anyone. And stop bothering me with these type of issues. Yes, agent. I'm Agent Félix, I swear! And I'm agent Rodríguez! Stop bothering me! Shut up! -Hi. -Hi, Bosco. Now is not a good time. I need to talk to Alejandra. Hi, little one. This is for you. See? Bosco always keeps his word. Let's go outside. Fruit yogurt. Ale, I swear, there's nothing going on between Beatriz and me. So what, you were inspecting her throat with your tongue? It wasn't like that. Besides, she was the one hitting on me. Ale, I swear, I didn't want to do it. Oh, so I'm blind now? Did I hallucinate that? A little bit of yogurt for this pretty car. Beatriz and I are only friends. Friends with benefits, right? Yes, but I won't do it again. Are you stupid, or what, Bosco? Don't ever call me again! Please, don't be like that. You'll call me soon enough, girl! Hey, Beatriz. Bosco. Want to go out for a drink? Yes, of course. I'll see you in a bit. Friends with benefits. You'll find out soon enough, Alejandra. -Close it. -Again? Why is it not working? Are you sure it worked that way? Yes, that's how Félix did it! What are you doing here? Nothing, Grandma, playing. This fridge brings back so many memories. Your grandpa and I always called it "desert," because it was always broken. Nico, come with me. Grab this. I'm sick of it. Take me there. Nico... you promised not to open it until you turned 15. Yes, but I... Calm down, I knew you'd do it. Give me that. By the way, your grandfather and I never understood why there was a slot in the back of the fridge. A slot? A slot. Well, I also have another one right here, in the back, that's useless to me. Edu, help me out! What happened? The slot! What? Help me move it. The coin I'm leaving you is very important. It'll only work once. -What now? -I don't know. Samuel, where are the kids? Cristina! Cristina! Rodrigo, where are they? What if they went to the other world? I'll kill my own son. I'll kill him. OK, OK. Let's tell them Edu will stay the night with us, and then we'll go back to look for them. Yes, you told me seven times already, honey. -Come on. -Yes, yes. -OK, yes. -Let's go. He's so, so... first he gets us in this mess, and now this? Where is he now? Where? Rodri... Don't get upset. How am I not going to get upset? -No. -No, no, no! They can't see me like this, no! They can't! Hi! Where's Edu? Edu is staying the night. -Sweetie. -Yes? Edu... needs to come home to study. Oh, but they already studied. All afternoon. Math. I thought you'd agree, so they went to the movies. With... Rodrigo. How could he leave, how? -Hey, Cristina! -Hey! Where's my favorite banker? Now Mr. Van Vatio? That stupid man. You know what? You know what? I love the way you look. I love that you always match. Red and white, ping and pong. My neighbors, so beautiful. Both of you. I love it. Edu is staying at Cris' house. I don't like it one bit. It's OK, honey. It's Saturday! Yes, Saturday! -Do you want his pajamas? -Oh, no, don't worry. -We have some for him. -I want him here early in the morning! Of course! No, you had to ruin it! If you want me to stay quiet, you need to give me half of your allowance for the next two weeks. You're evil. Tell your friend to watch out. Or I'll charge more. So start moving it, and go upstairs. They're looking for you. Now. When did they leave? Alejandra, like I said, we don't know! Look what the cat dragged in. Honey, welcome back! Where were you? Yes. Where the hell were you? Don't you realize we've been worried sick about you two? Explain yourself, right away! I'm going to my room. Let's go, Samuel. We went looking for Brisila. We went to the basement, and suddenly, we were at the other world. The other world. Oh, for crying out loud! The other world, Nico? So you just appeared there? -You didn't do anything first? -No. Look, Nico, you better not get us in trouble again! No, all I did was open the door to the basement, and suddenly we were away from the control room. I want you out in ten minutes. And don't do anything stupid, you've been too lazy lately. This place was more... It was a quiet place. I hope you didn't call attention to yourselves. Not at all. It was... an office. There were a bunch of... older ladies. But Edu and I hid so they wouldn't see us. What are you doing here? Where you spying on us? We didn't mean to scare you. How did you get in? There's no door over there. Did you spend the night there? No, we have an unusual... explanation. I don't know if you'll believe us. Look at their clothes. It's strange. Swear to me that no one recognized you. Are you the family of Agent Rodríguez? How do you know about that? It's all over the press! Look! AGENT RODRÍGUEZ AND HIS FAMILY... ALIVE ON EARTH? Everyone's talking about it. Besides, in school they taught us that agent Rodríguez died. This is so exciting! How did you leave Earth? Come on, tell us! If you are from the Rodríguez family, I'll give you so many kisses! Me too! I'll start with the little one. Come on, idiot. Tell them! No! -But... -No! Agent Rodríguez was his grandfather. I'm his neighbor and best friend. And I don't know how, we were ported back here. No one else will go into the basement! I don't want any more excitement, understood? Dad, Grandma is still floating and she's hit herself twice. Oh, God! It was wonderful. I fell in love eight times. You're late. Uncle Rungen, we shouldn't be seen here. I'm aware of it. Sit down. How are you? Can't you see? Pale. It's been a year and a half since I left my flat. Tell me the news. The government decided to forgive them if we manage to close the portal that connects to their house. That idiot president really decided to pardon them? What about the portal placed by that bastard? We're still looking for it, but haven't found it. The agent they sent somehow ended up in the Earth cell. -Which agent? -Félix. -The short guy. -Yes. They're alone. -Are they sending someone else? -No. I'm the only one that knows about it. Then it's time for our hit. You need to go. Don't you realize what you're asking me? It'll ruin my career, uncle. If they catch me, I'll spend my whole life in jail, uncle. I'm about to get married. -Next year-- -Silence! You were always the coward of the family. A chicken! Did you forget who killed my father? Your grandfather? I have plenty of plans for the President. She won't last too long. What do you want me to do if I go? Kill them? No. Worse than that. I want them extradited. If I have them here in Maktub, I can do with them whatever I want. Go, and don't fail me! J.J.! Remember, to be extradited, they need to arouse suspicion. And if something goes wrong, take care of Rodrigo, his son... Jeez, Uncle. Where's everyone? I asked a little privacy to talk to you. About what? Doctor, you know I've always looked up to you and admired you. J.J.! You better not try to propose to me. You know I'm in love with Félix. Just tell me one thing. Which side hurts most, the right or the left? What kind of question is that? -Félix? -Félix? Did it hurt? -But... -Sit down. What have you done? Go to sleep. Hush little baby... Again? No, it's not from the same! -Again? -Did Félix come back? Mom, don't grab that rifle, you already shot one. -I'll take Samuel outside. -Go ahead. Looks like there's no one here. Dear family! Who are you? -You're from the other world, right? -That's right. Yes, it's true. -Are you Félix's replacement? -Yes, yes. Let's have a seat over here. Thanks. I swear, what happened to Félix... was an accident. -You shot him? -Yes. How is he? We buried him yesterday. -What? Oh, no! -Yes. He was so little that... his body... fit in a shoebox. -Where's Gabriela? -Upstairs, with grandma Isabel. -Oh, your mother's not dead? -No. One question. -Are you from Mexico? -No. I'm from Maktub. And you are? I'm Edu, the neighbor. He's my friend. I had to tell him. Yes, but he's amazing at controlling his emotions. -Yes. -The alarms never go off. Yes, yes. Really? Show me how you do that. Impressive ability. What other strange superpowers did your family get? Oh, no! My daughter Gabriela can turn invisible anytime. My husband's head and butt turns red when he gets upset. Alejandra has the strength of a bull. And my mother-in-law can levitate. And Samuel, our dog, can climb walls. Yes, and I've got... nothing at all. That's enough questions, please. Let me ask you something. When will this be over? Actually, I have great news. The cosmic door in your basement will cease to exist at ten. In less than 10 minutes. -Finally! -Yes, please! -Yes! -Finally! Finally, honey! -Oh, my God! Thanks-- -Ma'am... Give me the weapon, I don't want to end up like Félix. Yes, of course. Finally, honey. Oh, one more thing. The bracelets. -The bracelets? -Really? We don't need them anymore. -Oh, of course! -Of course, here. -Yes, we don't need them. -Great! Nothing works in Maktub. Finally, honey! Yes, dear. Finally, it's over. -Who is it? -It's Pedro Solas. The Minister? Yes, please, Doctor, it's an emergency. I'll be right out, wait outside. I'll be right out. Doctor, I'm so sorry to bother you at home. I couldn't wait. -I'm doing terribly! -I see. I'm sorry, very sorry, but you can't come in right now. -Minister. -I'm very sorry... -Yes, he's the Minister. -Nice to meet you. I was just telling him he can't come in. -Why not? -Because we have a family emer-- A situation. -I can see you-- -No! He'll have a heatstroke out here. Would you like some water? Come in, please. Make yourself at home. Good morning. Yes, honey, remember Pedro? My patient. My client. Mom, Grandma is floating and won't fit in the bathroom. Gabriela! Hi. I'll do it myself. You're the Minister of Finance! You told her about me? I'm your biggest fan. I also want to be the Minister of Finance when I'm older. How does it feel to have people respect you and fear you? It's... nice. Let's go to the kitchen. We have things to talk about. So please, let me ask you for... some privacy. I'm sorry to bother you. It's no bother at all, sir! Make yourself at home, please. Yes, go ahead. No bother? What if he finds out about us? He won't find out. It'll all be over soon. Dad, the Minister of Finance is in our house. I think he's handsome. Gabriela, please don't go in the kitchen. Understood? Watch her. I'm going to take a shower. -I'll take care of it. -You're from the other world? That's right. I came to take over for Félix. -Hey, sweetie. -Yes? You can go invisible whenever you want, right? I really am sorry for coming unannounced, Doctor. But I'm feeling terrible. I feel like I can't breathe. It's an acute case of anxiety. But what do I do? I'm supposed to meet the President. I've been fighting all my life for this position. And now... Oh, no! No. I think I was caught. Everything OK? -I just saw your daughter. -Invisible? -Yes. -Typical. It's a textbook case. That's strange. -Let me get you a tranquilizer. -Yes, please. -Stay here, please. -Yes. -Right here, please. -Yes. -Don't leave. -Don't take too long. What's wrong with you? -Mom-- -No, this time, I'm going to punish you. Hey... When will this be over? -A few more seconds. -Finally! Mom. You have to understand, for me that man is like George Clooney for you. You won't get away with this. -It's always the same! -You're punished. Let's go! That bastard, J.J., betrayed us. How long have you been in that cell? The mother shot me by mistake as soon as I landed on Earth. I'm sorry. It's my fault, J.J. lied to me. He lied to all of us! We must go back to Earth. We need to find the door that Agent Rodríguez left behind. Otherwise, that family is lost. Let's tell the President. It's not the family's fault. J.J. changed the rules of the game. No, Félix, not the President! She said it clearly, if the light turned red, no matter what, -it would be the family's fault. -Doctor! I think we've found the door! And it was here, where supposedly the grandson of Agent Rodríguez, in the company of another boy, connected with Maktub. The wormhole, the door to planet Earth, connected to a girl's dressing room at Aladina University. We have two witnesses here. Tell us. What did they look like? What did they say? They were very small. Dressed in weird clothes. But very cute. -Yes, very cute. -They were very nice. Really. Could you hold it for me? Thanks. Alberto Peláez, here for Maktub T.V. I'm so stupid, of course! They built that university on top of Agent Rodriguez's old home! Hurry! Lock the university, don't let anyone else in! Run! Félix! Be careful. J.J. is dangerous. So am I. I need the coordinates for the university, now! Anything to declare? -Where's the door? -In the hallway, sir. -Honey, it's almost over. -Yes. -It's almost time. -Honey! What happened? -It's almost ten. -Yes, yes. Three, two, one... There! It's finally over! -Thank goodness! -It's over, Daddy! Why did I never have powers? Why am I always the last one to know what's happening in this house? Mom, let go of that vase. You don't need it. Why? Do you want to see me float like a balloon? You won't float anymore. Give me that. Oh, no, my mother! Yes? Take it! -Why? -I don't know! Gaby, disappear. You said I couldn't! Do it now! No! Will I still have mine? Hey, put me down! Oh, no! Why? Hi, we came to pick up Edu. I'm J.J., a friend of the family. Come in. Please, make yourselves at home. They're upstairs, but they'll come down soon. Have a seat. Edu! -Your parents are here! -My parents! What do we do? Pick everything up and go with them. Quickly! Run! I'll give the Minister a tranquilizer and make him leave. Who's that lady? Mom, that's my wife! Honey, don't do that to me! -Dad, Dad! -What happened now? -Boss! -Teo? -Boss! -Teo, what are you doing here? The Dutch are here! -When? -Now. They're parking. The big boss is here! -Stop bothering me! -Where were you? I've been calling you all morning! -Don't let them in, I'll come down. -OK. Teo, Teo! Why are you dressed in black? It's your mother's wake! I can't believe this. The Dutch! Why do they think it's a wake? Because they think Grandma died. They came to offer their condolences. They think I died? No, no, no, Mom. It was a mistake, Mom. Don't go downstairs, please! -Mom, please! -Dad! -What? -You can't go down like that! -Why not? -Because... Your... Oh, no, this is a mess! How was Edu? Was he a bother? Of course not, he was great. -Where's Rodrigo? -He's coming soon. I don't think those ten minutes were enough. -It hasn't happened yet. -Strange. Let it be clear, I'm not dead! And... My mother-in-law. Finally, nice to meet you, ma'am. Ma'am, that vase must be very heavy, here, I'll help you. Don't take that vase! She loves holding it! My grandma will start floating. -Hi! -Hi, sweetie! -How are you, Nicolás? -Hi. Ma'am, I don't want you to hurt yourself, let me take that vase. He killed his grandma. I really love my grandma. Kids. Grandma, let's go to the kitchen. Good morning. Oh, yes. Pedro is a friend of the family. Mom, Dad. Let's go home. Why the hurry? It's Sunday! Why don't you stay? We can play board games, or something else? Do we know each other? You look familiar. He hears that all the time. Yes. Yes, we have a lot to talk about, so bye, Edu! Bye, girl. -I'm-- -Come in. I don't like that man in the striped suit. Oh. Nicolás, honey, take your grandmother to the garden. It's nice outside. Fine. I'm doing terribly. -I think I'm doing worse. -Did you see her levitating? Yes! Did you see that too? No, but it's typical of your condition. Take this medication. No, that's not it. Take one of these. No, two. Let me get some water. Baby? I swear, I know that man. Maybe I'm wrong, but I heard them say... he's a Minister. -Minister? -Solas! Pedro Solas, the Minister of Finance! Really? -What is he doing here? -I don't know. But we're in conversations with them. If my boss only knew... -Mom, Dad, can we leave? -Shut up! Go in there, right away. Win him over, use Ricardo Laso's charm. Going. Yes? Hi, we came to see Rodrigo. -Come in, come in. -Oh, no, no, no. He said he was coming. Wait a minute, don't leave. Dad, those Dutch guys are here, you need to calm down. -I can't, honey. -Yes, you can. I don't get it, why do we still have powers? Let me call Teo's phone. Don't let them in! Don't! Sorry, sorry. -Yes, Alejandra? -Good morning. I'm so glad you speak English. Hi, I'm Teo, I work with Rodrigo. -Why are you in a black suit? -Don't you know? They think Isabel died. What? Alejandra said they can't come in. Tell them... that her dad is very sad, and he appreciates the visit. But it's best if we all leave. -You don't speak English. -No, no, no. Rodrigo! Your bosses are here! Gaby, honey, how am I doing? What if you calm down? What about now? This, red, like a monkey's butt. And that looks like a Christmas tree. You're a mess. You could be more than a minister. Ricardo, the Minister doesn't like being bothered -when he's here for-- -No, no. Cristina, my intention wasn't to bother the Minister. I just wanted to ask him if my secretary, at some point, could contact his department. We got to meet people at his department this year, -and I'd want to know if my secretary -No, no. -and... -Just one. Oh, is he mentally ill? That's enough. OK? There's someone here. Come. Félix! Are you OK? Do I look like I'm OK? My mother didn't mean to shoot you. It was an accident. J.J. said everything would end at ten. But everything's still the same. J.J. works for a very dangerous guy that hated your grandfather. He wants to destroy you. That's why he took our bracelets! Where's the rifle I brought? J.J. put it in the armoire. He has the key. Listen to me. The poor thing died. So should I call you, or wait for your secretary? Hi, Rodrigo! -What's with the hat? -I have a fever. It's nothing. -Could I use the restroom? -Of course. Go ahead. First door by the entrance. We'll talk later, Pedro. I don't understand. Who died? Excuse me? Died? Yes. Oh. If one more person says I'm dead, I'll throw this can at them! Oh! No, no, no, no. I'm sorry, sweetie, I didn't know. -Yes. -This is for Alejandra, from Bosco! Mariachis! Oh! You've got to be kidding me. Through dark tresses, heavenly one... A pair of deep brown eyes Heavenly one, smuggled Félix! Ay, ay, ay, ay... Félix! Félix! -J.J. -What happened to you? Did you touch a power line, or what? We know you work for Rungen Zelig. Rungen Zelig? You filthy snake! That beauty mark you have Heavenly one Next to your mouth Don't share it with anyone but me... I'm sure you're thinking this is it for us. Right? My dad shining. Above and below. To make matters worse, my grandmother was levitating. Everyone seemed shock by what they saw. They'd extradite us to Maktub! But suddenly, a miracle. This wasn't our end. I used to keep a firecracker, something given to me by another classmate. Félix's plan was for everyone to get out of the house. I had to cause a distraction outside. I promise, I didn't mean to throw it over there. My car! MY CAR! At least Eduardo's parents went out. Meanwhile, J.J. and Félix started fighting in our living room. We got lucky with the Dutch. The big boss had an itchy throat. He got scared with the explosion and choked on the pill. My sister, using her powers, got him out of the house. But suddenly, things got worse again. My sister got him out with a kiss. The fight continued in the kitchen. The reason you didn't see my little sister was because her mission was to become invisible and steal the keys to the armoire from J.J. Then, my mother gave the rifle to my father. But my mom made a mistake again, this time to poor Teo. Finally, my father found his courage and went to the basement to help. To prevent himself from making a mistake, he had a little help. The only one left was the Minister. But he had used so many tranquilizers, not even a flying cow would've surprised him. Hey! Hey! Hey! Help me, please! Please! Help me! Where are you going? Thank you for everything, Félix. Yes, Félix, thank you for everything. We're really going to miss you. You can keep my teddy bear. His name is Guzmán. I hope you take care of him. Promise?
