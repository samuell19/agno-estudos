[THEME MUSIC] What the fuck are you looking at? Son of a bitch. Don't fucking look at me. Yo. Yo, man. You're gonna be OK. All right? It's a new day. Come on. [SOBBING] Come on, pull it together, dog. All right. It'll be OK. What's up, dog, what're you having? Uh, just gimme a beer. Brand? Whatever you got on tap's fine. [SIGHS] Ain't that bad, is it? I'm just having a bad day. Yo, you see that guy down there? [WEEPING] That guy is having a bad day. Well then, I guess it's just a day for bad days. What's your story, dog? I'm actually thinking of quitting my job. Fucking A, do it. Screw those cheap bastards. You don't even know what I do. Doesn't matter. Get those assholes off your back once and for, you go to work for yourself. It's the only way to make a decent living in this town today. You thinks so? Absolutely. Walk out the door, slap that boss man across his fat face, you tell him to kiss your ass. Well, that might affect my severance package. You know what, dog? You look familiar. Yeah, have you seen the television show, &quot;The Search for Intelligent Life&quot;? [THEME MUSIC] Welcome to this week's edition of &quot;The Search for Intelligent Life.&quot; I'm your host, Max Harmon. Think for a moment, what would an encounter with alien visitors be like? The following testimonials from people just like you may give us a clue? Yeah, I was on my way back to my mother in law's house when I had to urinate real bad. It was late and I didn't see no other cars, so I parked on the side of the road here and started urinating in the grass over there. Then three of them came running across the field right at me. But turned out they was Shriners. They scared the hell out of me just the same. Excuse me, sir, but what would you do if UFOs landed on the White House lawn tomorrow? Look I don't know about that, but I do know that if I don't ever kick this coke habit, I'm never going to be strong enough to tell my wife that I'm cheating on her with my secretary or confess to arson fires on the south side. Is that thing on? Oh yeah, I was abducted. But you know, I didn't mind. I don't know what I would have done of Chuck Norris hadn't shown up. I was abducted and taken aboard a space vessel in the fall of 1988. I don't remember too much about it, but I have made arrangements to undergo a session of hypnosis in order to pull the memories from me. Hello. I'm Dr. Reynolds, and this is my associate, Dr. McGee. We're here today to place the subject, Francesca, into a state of hypnosis, in order that she can recall memories about an incident that occurred several years ago. And we've interviewed Francesca on several occasions before this session, and believe her to be honest in her claim that she was abducted by non-human entities. It appears the subject is sufficiently under, so let's begin. Francesca, I want you to go back in time. I want you to go back approximately seven years to the evening of September 18, 1988. Can you do that for me? Yes. On the evening of September 18, 1988, something extraordinary happened. It will come back to you very quickly. Do you remember? Yes. I want you to try to relive that experience. [MOANING] Bobby. Oh, Bobby. DR. REYNOLDS: No need to go on. Yes, Bobby! Yes! DR. REYNOLDS: Hey, hey. Uh, Francesca, Francesca, that's enough. It's OK. Listen, listen. We want to move ahead a couple days, to the 28th. OK, the 28th. You were with your boyfriend, walking home from the movies. OK. And then you and your boyfriend, James, had an argument and you were walking alone. OK. What happened next? Lights. Bright lights. All around me. How do you feel? I feel dizzy, and frightened. Hands grabbing me, I can't stand up, and I black out. DR. REYNOLDS: Do you remember waking up? On a table. Very scared. Strange people standing around me. Bright light. And they're holding things, like tools. Getting back to the 18th. [HEAVY BREATHING] That really wasn't necessary. Oh, Bobby. You were thinking the same thing. I most certainly was not. Oh, you've been looking for an opportunity like that ever since Shirley left you. Doctor, need I remind you this is a serious scientific experiment. I will not tolerate juvenile behavior. Listen, it was an honest mistake. It looks like an 18 in my notes Well, it's the 28th. Learn to write. Look at your notes, it looks like the 23rd. Oh. Frank! Frank! I can't believe that's shit, dog, I love that show. You're Al Manac, the reporter, huh? Investigative journalist. Like Geraldo and shit. Yeah, I guess, in some respects. Getting all beat up during interviews? Well, in that respect, yes. Now, let's join Al Manac, one of our star investigators, in the studio with a live report brought to you in alien vision. And I'm in the studio today with Rich Bowler. Bowler. Bowler. How you doing, Mr. bowler? Who claims to have actually photographed a UFO. So what can you tell us about the incident? Well, some friends of mine and myself went down to the state park for a picnic and I brought along my camera. And right in the middle of everything some really strange things started happening. Scared the [BLEEP] out of everybody. May we see the photos now? Hell yeah, I didn't come down here to wipe your [BLEEP] for you. OK. Gees. Here's Sylvester and Martha and Pretty Boy Larry. We were all having a pretty good time till Larry nearly ruined the day with his flatulence. I don't know what that boy was eating, but it damn near cleared out the park. Here's the homeless guy that Sylvester knifed in the gut. [BLEEP] I mean, he's a lot of fun and all, Sylvester, but he ain't too bright. We all covered for him though. Here's Bigfoot. We just caught a glimpse of him running through the trees. They should have named him big ass though. Just look at that thing, will you? Ass the size of my kitchen. Kind of reminds me of a girl I beat the [BLEEP] out of. Uh, I've been looking at these photographs Mr. Bowler, and I don't see anything resembling a UFO. I gotta build up to it, you [BLEEP]. You don't want your viewers to die of shock, do you? I can't just throw this evidence on them without some sort of [BLEEP] build up. Think of the lawsuits, you ignorant ass. Of course, of course, of course, you're right. Anyway, here's Elvis, the smoothest, coolest, singing [BLEEP] that ever walked on this [BLEEP] planet. Everybody thought he was dead, but I found him living high off the hog up in the birch tree talking to the [BLEEP] birdies. And now the evidence you've all been waiting for, an actual photo of an alien craft full of those little [BLEEP] space men just waiting to hop out and screw us all over. Where is it? It's behind the trees. Behind the trees? How are we supposed to see if it's behind the trees? Who do you think you're talking to you [BLEEP] yo-yo? I don't know, I ought to break your damn neck for that. [BLEEP] you're thinking of calling me a liar and-- COMMANDER LYLE (ON RADIO): Houston, Houston we have a problem. Houston, are you reading me? MISSION CONTROL (ON RADIO): We read you, Commander Hacker. What is your problem? COMMANDER LYLE (ON RADIO): This is Lyle. Commander Hacker was just out-- he's doing his-- he's outside the shuttle doing today's space walk. He's trying to-- oh, god. Oh, god. MISSION CONTROL (ON RADIO): Commander Lyle, stay calm and tell us what is happening. COMMANDER LYLE (ON RADIO): Commander Hacker, he was out doing a space walk and- and a ship hit him. It was a big ship, real big. Oh, god. MISSION CONTROL (ON RADIO): Commander Lyle, stay calm. Did you say a ship? COMMANDER LYLE (ON RADIO): A ship, yeah, a UFO man, a damn flying saucer. It flew by real close and Hacker's space suit must have got caught on the ship's antenna. He's gone, man. I can't believe it. Commander Schultz and Rodriguez are out there too just shaking their heads. They can't believe it either. Oh, man. MISSION CONTROL (ON RADIO): Hold on, Commander Lyle. We're bringing in someone to advise. Oh, and while we've got you Lyle, we have some bad news. COMMANDER LYLE (ON RADIO): What? MISSION CONTROL (ON RADIO): Your car was stolen last night. COMMANDER LYLE (ON RADIO): Oh, man. What else could go wrong? I can't believe it, I cannot believe it. Oh, man. So you investigate like alien dudes and space ships and shit? That's one way to put it. Damn dude, that's cool. Yo, this dude knows about space guys and flying sauces and crap. That's another way to put it. That's a bunch of bullshit. I was in the war, goddammit. Yo, what's up with that new chick reporter, man? What's her name, the one they brought on this season? Christy Carmichael. The network thought we needed to add something to boost the ratings, so the producers came up with a couple of things. So then when I was 11 years old my mother put me in the Little Miss West Dundee contest and I won first runner up. I knew from that moment that I was destined to have a career in show business. PRODUCER: OK, um, Christy, we're ready. Did you get the close up already? PRODUCER: Uh, yeah, got it. OK, OK. PRODUCER: OK, and three, two-- Hello, I'm Christy Carmichael and I'm standing here today with George Ogden of Ogden Sky &quot;Obstervasen--&quot; oh darn, I screwed it up. PRODUCER: Cut. Three, two-- Hello, I'm Christy Carmichael and I'm standing here today with George Ogden of Ogden Sky Systems, Observation Systems. Oh, this is hard, and I'm not even blonde anymore. Hi, I'm Christy and I'm standing here today with George Olson of Ogden Sky-- PRODUCER: It's Ogden. His name is Ogden. Oh, shoot. I'm so sorry Mr Olson. PRODUCER: Ogden! Sometimes I get really excited about my work and my heart just beats so fast it gets hard to concentrate. I see what you mean. PRODUCER: Christy, I have an idea. [THEME MUSIC] Hi, I'm Christy, and you are? I'm George, George Ogden. And what is that you do, Mr Ogden? I own Ogden Sky Observation Systems. And what is it that you observe? Well, what we do is make sky scanning software that can be used in conjunction with-- Ooh, that sounds technical. You must be very smart. Oh, well I don't know about that. Isn't it true that you recently went through a devastating divorce? What? All right, I want to know one thing, you've got to be straight with me. Yeah, what's that? You news guys smoke a lot of weed, right? What? I'm just fucking with you, dog. Do you? I can't speak for everybody in the industry, but as for myself, absolutely not. Come on, what about Peter Jennings? Well, he might. All right, look, is this shit for real? I mean, like this show you're on, is it serious? Well, the producers take it seriously. I take it seriously. But I have to admit there are a few people on the show that think a little differently. After the break we will answer the age old question, what do alien visitors do with all that livestock genitalia. So don't go away, we'll be right back you stupid, gullible fucks. PRODUCER: OK, so we'll just edit that last part out, shall we? Hey, whatever. It's your show. Can I get some mouthwash? Just saying those words makes me feel like I've been sucking someone's ass. Good one, man. Hey, hey, you're fucking fired. And now it's time for this week's celebrity alien report. Uh yeah listen, I don't know what you want from my life really, but I'm a very busy man. I've got things going on, I'm working on my tour and stuff, so I really don't have time to be interviewed about aliens. Not that I don't believe in aliens, because I do believe in aliens, I just don't have time to talk about it right now. Aliens are a very big part of my life, as a matter of fact. I have many friends in Los Angeles that are of the alien race. There's many different species of aliens, but I don't want to get into it because it's all too confusing. I mean, there's the ones with six fingers, there's the ones with three heads, there's the tall skinny ones, the short, fat ones. Everybody knows this. There's Michael Jackson. So I mean, there's really, there's all different breeds, you know. Hello, my name is Dr. EG Nog. I study the UFO phenomenon full time, and it was I who developed the three levels of encounters listed here. Encounter type 1, sighting a UFO. Encounter type 2, physical evidence left behind by a UFO, and the third type, contact with alien being from a UFO. My original list actually consisted of 10 levels of encounters, but the scientific community only adopted the first three. Now this has been a sore spot with me ever since, because as you can see, the levels of encounters become increasingly more specific as you go along. Why would they want encounter type 1, a simple sighting, when they could have encounter type five, which is gently rubbing an alien's flesh? And why should, why should physical evidence be so important when they could have encounter type six, where an alien walks up to you very nicely, but then smashes you over the head with a board. Huh? And finally the clincher, encounter type 3, contact with alien beings, face to face meeting. Big deal. It can't hold a candle to encounter type nine, where aliens move into your neighborhood and they play the stereo so loud that nobody can get any sleep. Oh, my. I'm sorry. Look, write your congressman. Tell them you want all the facts. Hell, I'm Al Manac. I'm here at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, also known as NASA. I'm here with Brian Johnson, who's the new project leader for the new Mars Rover program. Hello, Brian. Hey. Uh Brian, I just got to ask. You seem kind of young to be in such a position of power. Yeah, but I won the contest, so here I am. What contest? You didn't see it? It's the show on Fox last spring, &quot;Who Wants to be a Project Leader.&quot; That's where I've seen you? That was for NASA? Yeah. I was also on a show called &quot;Who Wants to be a Criminal,&quot; but I lost that one. Good thing too, because the guy who won is doing 10 years in San Quentin. OK, so you have no idea what we're talking about here. None whatsoever. But I am signed up to do a show next summer called &quot;Who Wants to Make Love to Madonna.&quot; And the odds are pretty good, because there's supposed to be 150 winners. I am just wasting my time here. Pretty much, but I did find this video in a drawer. It's pretty crazy, you might want to check it out. Yeah. [VCR NOISES] COMPUTER: Malfunction. Malfunction. Malfunction. This is Patrolman Midok, is anyone receiving this signal? COMPUTER: Malfunction. This is patrolman Midok, I have an emergency situation, please respond. COMPUTER: Malfunction. I'm piloting a Max II class control shop. COMPUTER: Malfunction. Computer, would you shut up, please? This is Patrolman Midok. Is anyone receiving this signal? This is Patrolman Midok, anyone out there, please respond. Ah, hello? Yes, hello. Hello, this is Patrolman Midok. Are you receiving my signal? Hello? Yes, hello. This is Patrolman Midok. Can you respond? Hello? [LOUD SCREECHING] Ah! Yes, hello? Hey, where are you going? This is Patrolman Midok! Ah, forget it. Hello. Hello? Hello. Hello. Oh, yes. Do you acquire assistance? Are you talking to me? Uh, yes. To whom am I speaking? Finally. This is Patrolman Midok, piloting a Max II class patrol vehicle. During a random patrol of the outer border my vessel came under attack by the Cartilage people of Urass. Now, I took a direct hit. I have computer malfunctions, and my navigation unit is down. Oh, man. And to whom am I speaking? Oh, I'm Ozzy Jaloppy. And what is it that you do? I'm a night duty person, emergency navigational control. Well, that's what I need. I'm sending out a locator pulse. Can you locate me? I sure think, Patrolman Midol. Midok. Mi- dok. Sorry, Patrolman Midok. And which band is your locator pulse on? 27b. Really? You know, that's my apartment number. Wow. I'm not reading anything, Patrolman Midok. Is your pulse rate set for distances this far? I didn't know I could adjust it. I've never had to use it before. Oh, yes. Well see, they're very distant specific. How do I adjust the pulse? Your Max II emergency manual will give you instructions for the adjustment. Emergency manual? I've got that thing packed away in the cargo hold. Oh, I love cargo holds. My uncle used to keep me one. What are you carrying? Not much, a few containers of urite minerals and a shipment of Hipherion cave rats. I'm in a hurry. My grandfather was bit by a Hipherion cave rat. He died in two weeks. They're poisonous. Oh, wait a minute. Maybe I can access your technical manual from technical support. What's your ship's code name. I'm not supposed to give out that information. Well then, as mother always used to tell me, I can't help you. All right. Code name Muffin. Don't say a word. Accessing. You're in uh, section 19, right? Correct. You're piloting a Max II patrol ship, right? Correct. Code name Muffin? Correct. Got it. Now, your L beam should be set at five and 1/2 and your vector should be hovering at .002. It's on that setting now. What? Stand by. Oh, OK. Here you are. Sorry about that, I was looking at the wrong meter. Is there anyone else there I could speak to? That's a negative, sir, a skeleton crew here. Everyone is at Colonel Conway's promotion party. I'm heading there in a few minutes. I'm bringing the vegetable dip. COMPUTER: Take me to your leader. Oh, I've got your coordinates here. Are you listening? Hanging on every word. OK, can you hear me OK? Yes, your signal is fine. I'd better boost up the signal, I think. All right, go ahead, you little bastard. COMPUTER: Report to bridge. [NO AUDIO] Uh, hello? Hello? Hey, you cut the audio. Hey stupid, you cut the audio. There is no sound. [HIGH PITCHED SCREECHING] Ah! Where you going? Hey! Well, can you believe this? COMPUTER: Emergency. High levels of radiation. Sorry about that, Patrolman Midok. I was catching some wicked feedback and I had to get myself another ice tea. Now you listen to me. Now you cut off all the audio signals and I didn't hear a word you said. I just got a sensor alert, and I've got a ship out there with the exact same dimensions as the cargo ship that attacked me earlier. Now you get things together down there, and you get me home. What was that? Urass! The Cartilage people from Urass! Yes sir, maybe I just point to your position on a star chart. You can do that? Oh, yes sir. Would you like me to do that? Why not. OK. OK, I punch it up here. You should have it on your monitor in a few seconds. OK, do you see it now? No, I don't see it. All right, wait a minute, now I have something. This is not the star chart. Now what you should be seeing now is System Four. Do you see System Four? No, no I don't. I must be feeding you the wrong signal. What do you see? I've been from one side of this galaxy to the other, and I can honestly say that I've never seen anything like this. Can you describe it? No. I've stopped all video transmissions, so if you're still getting something it's coming from a nearby planet. Hey, I've got to get up for a second. I've got to get some more ice tea, OK. [COUGHING] COMPUTER: High levels of radiation. We are under attack. [ALARM BLARING] Hey Ozzy, Ozzy! Hey, I've got a ship right on my tail. Are you with me? It is confirmed. It is the Cartilage vessel that attacked me before. It's signaling me, telling me to-- not sure what they're telling me, but it doesn't sound friendly. [NON-ENGLISH] Something has just exited the enemy's ship. It's headed in my general direction. I'm not sure what it is. It's kind of phallic shaped. [NON ENGLISH SPEECH CONTINUES OVER MONITOR] Oh, my. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] [FIRE CRACKLES] [EXPLOSIONS] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] Damn dude, that sounds freaky. Yeah, unfortunately that film was burned by Los Angeles gang members. But with my luck, probably would have turned out to be a fake anyway. Yo, you see this dude? [SOBBING] He had two heart attacks this morning, all right. That, my friend is bad luck. What about me, huh? You think it's easy for me working this bar all day then go out and sell joints out of my car all night? Shit. I just said that out loud, didn't I? Yeah. I was shot three fucking times. I don't think anybody heard you. Anyway, what I'm saying is everybody strikes out a few times, bro. You know, you just gotta keep swinging, because one of these days, you're going to hit a home run. Think so? Hell, I don't know. I heard that shit on Oprah last week. But if I was a space dude with issues that's the show I want to be on. Have you ever wondered about the size of our galaxy? No? Well, it's big. And here to help us understand just how big is noted professor of agriculture, Robert Foster. PRODUCER: Cut. Is this shit right? Let's say you have a pickle. Now this pickle represents our solar system and the seeds inside the pickle represent the heavenly bodies in our solar system. Now, if all solar systems can be represented by a pickle about this size and our pickle was in a warehouse in Clarksdale, Mississippi, then the nearest star with a possible solar system would be located in a water treatment plant just outside of Memphis, Tennessee. This means our Milky Way galaxy would require a pickle patch as large as the United States. And we even stretch into Canada, just short of where my brother had his car accident. Now in this area there are literally billions of pickles. How likely is it that our pickle is the only pickle that contains a seed with life? You see, it is far more likely that we live in a pickle patch with life teeming inside a great many pickles. [THEME MUSIC] MISSION CONTROL (ON RADIO): Commander Lyle, are you with us? COMMANDER LYLE (ON RADIO): Where you guys been? It came back. The ship came back. It go Rodriquez. It also knocked Schultz away from the shuttle and snapped his line. He's just floating out there, man. He's like, he's trying to swim back to the ship. It ain't helping him, though. Man, he's looking stupid out there. MISSION CONTROL (ON RADIO): Commander Lyle, Professor Karl Grubbles is on his way to the control room. He is an expert on sunspot activity. COMMANDER LYLE (ON RADIO): Sunspot activity? What's he going to do? I ain't got sunspots, man. I got UFOs. MISSION CONTROL (ON RADIO): He studies UFOs in his spare time. COMMANDER LYLE (ON RADIO): Well, get him in there, man. Oh, god. MISSION CONTROL (ON RADIO): Commander Lyle. COMMANDER LYLE (ON RADIO): Yeah? MISSION CONTROL (ON RADIO): We've just then been informed that Professor Grubbles is stock in the elevator. COMMANDER LYLE (ON RADIO): Oh, man! I can't believe it! I, I cannot believe it. What are you people doing down there? Yo man, I'm listening to your words, but I ain't hearing what you're saying, all right? Because if there's all this evidence, how come the government don't know about it? The government does know about it. The government has the biggest stockpile of evidence in existence, besides Crispin Glover. That's not a fair comparison, because the odds are that Crispin Glover actually is from another planet. Yeah, I'll buy that. [ALARM BLARING] This is truly an important day for all the UFO seekers around the globe. [BUGLE CALL IN THE DISTANCE] I'm at, uh, I can't give that location out, but I'm at a secret military base that has been assigned the task of gathering information from every reported encounter with alien visitors. This operation has been active for over 30 years and is planet wide. Overseeing the operation is Major Marion Marco. I just have to ask, Major Marco, why the sudden need to get this information here gathered out to the people? Times are changing, son. I can remember a time when alien snot balls kept pretty much to themselves, only the occasional abduction or cattle mutilation to worry about. But in the last five years, alien abductions are up nearly 70%. Instead of staying up in the sky where they belong, these booger munchers are trying to penetrate, manipulate our basic way of life. I'm not having it. I'm going to make available to you some of the most mucous moving film footage you've ever been exposed to in your short, meaningless life. The film is of an aircraft taking off from a mountaintop in Siberia in 1948. You can see one of them spit sucking aliens real good. I've had a film analyst tell me he's carrying a set of horse testicles. But just between you and me I'd say it looks more like pig testicles, but who am I to argue with experts? HANS MORRISON: The first thing we do is examine the film stock to make sure that it was available in the time that they claim that the film was shot, which in this case was 1948, I believe. The film stock was quite available at that time. So we don't suspect foul play. And oh, Phillip! Phillip, come and look at this. Look at this, look at these testicles. They're massive. Phillip, could you-- are they-- are there any more of those Girl Scout Cookies left? Oh, yes. OK. No, no, the Thin Mints, the Thin Mints if you have the Thin Mints. Thank you. OK, now in this shot we-- no Thin Mints? I'll tell you son, once you've seen that film footage you'll want to wrap your own guts around a stick, but that's just the beginning of what I've got to show you. Well Major, what are you and the rest of the military prepared to do if these aliens turn out to be hostile? Oh, we know they're hostile all right, or at the very least extremely sarcastic. Well, aren't you worried that our technology may not be a match for them if they have a full fledged invasion against us? Cowards like you are the reasons I go to bars and start fights. I've got another film I'll make available to you that will make you want to rip out your own kneecaps with pride. It's a prime example of human beings rising to the occasion when adversity flashes its swollen privates. It shows a small Christmas get together in 1974 that was nearly destroyed by an alien invasion. [EXPLOSION IN THE DISTANCE] [MUSIC - &quot;GOOD KING WENCESLAS&quot;] [ALARMS BLARING] Are you developing any kind of defensive measures? You want to know in an honest to goodness attack do we have firepower powerful enough to grab the aliens by their scruffy little necks and rub their ugly faces in their own vomit. Well, yes. The answer to your question is no, we don't have anything that will do that, but we are working on something that will be just as embarrassing. Do you mind if I ask you what all the excitement is around here? I'm not sure, but I am sure I have a piece of evidence that will slit your nipples. HANS MORRISON: Now, when we get a film like this we always assume that it is a fake until something proves us otherwise. This film was shot in the late 1950s, I believe. And uh, I've seen several like this. Oh, Phillip! Phillip look. Look, Phillip look. We went from large testicles to no testicles. That's funny, no? No testicles. Hey, what's up, dog? Hey, man. I need the usual. [LAUGHING] Yeah, I love this guy, always hooks me up with a nice fat sack of this beautiful, kind bud. Hey man, this ain't the usual. Does this smell right, man? How would I know. I need the usual stuff, man. Man, what is this, man? I need the usual man, the good shit. That is the usual plus. Oh, yeah that's what I love about this guy, man. He always hooks you up good. The time has come again for this week's celebrity alien report. Have you ever tried having sex with one? Forget about it. They got many different areas. You don't even want to find out where they belong. It's scary. Leave me alone, I got to go. I'm out of here. The light just came up over these hills. We thought it was a helicopter at first, but it wasn't very loud, just a low humming sound. Yeah, helicopters are usually louder. It wasn't that loud at all, so-- Why do you always have to do that? Do what? Every time I'm telling a story you just jump in. Oh, I'm sorry. Just shut up for a minute and then you can tell your side. Sorry. This is where the light came lower. It looked like it was blocking the road. You could tell it couldn't have been too big either. I mean, the trees are pretty close together down-- sorry. We drive down this road about half a dozen times each year, so I remember exactly when it happened. It was the night Mitch proposed to me. She said no. We just parked the car and watched for about 10 minutes. Why do you have to tell people that? Is it anybody's business? Sorry. You're a real prick, you know that. Ah, shit! I'm waiting in the car. Ah! COMMANDER LYLE (ON RADIO): Houston! Come in, Houston. Houston, for god's sake, come in! MISSION CONTROL 2 (ON RADIO): This is Houston. Go ahead, Commander Hacker. COMMANDER LYLE (ON RADIO): This is Lyle! I already told you. What the hell is going on down there? I told you an hour ago, Hacker is gone. Rodriquez is gone. And they just came back for Schultz. MISSION CONTROL 2 (ON RADIO): Uh, sorry Commander Lyle, nobody told me anything. We just had our shift change. COMMANDER LYLE (ON RADIO): Oh, man! What is wrong with you people down there? They're going to come after me next. Where is Professor Grubbles? MISSION CONTROL 2 (ON RADIO): Uh, Professor Grubbles was found dead in the elevator not 20 minutes ago. COMMANDER LYLE (ON RADIO): Oh, man! MISSION CONTROL 2 (ON RADIO): Uh, Commander Lyle, did you hear about your car? Yeah, I can't believe it. MISSION CONTROL 2 (ON RADIO): They think it was your fiance. Someone says they saw her drive off in it with another guy. COMMANDER LYLE (ON RADIO): Good god! This is the single worst day I have ever had. Oh, man. This is unbelievable. Excuse me. Are your restrooms in the back? Straight back, end of the hall. Thank you. Don't mention it. And there are no video cameras in the heating vents. What? Nothing. Hey, have you ever done a story on Roswell? Roswell, New Mexico? Yeah, you know where that space ship crashed like in 1947. You ever been there? Sort of. God, nobody's going to believe this is New Mexico. Now wasn't that fantastic? And now this. [URINATING] Oh, we're ready? All right. See, me and Ralph was fishing at this lake when a small craft, about the size of my mobile home, came up over them tree tops over there. This beam of light flashed out of it. It was really something to see. Then real sudden like these two spaceman-- and I knew that's what they was, they was spacemen-- they came running up and they grabbed Ralph. They dragged him off into that clearing. Then that light hit them again and they was gone. Tell you what, man, they startled me so bad I almost left. I stuck with it, caught me a few more fish. Nothing worth keeping really. So I was packing up, getting ready to go when I heard this loud clap of thunder. Looked up, I saw Ralph falling through them trees, hitting every branch all the way down. He had a bad cut on his cheek and his wrist was broke. He was shook up, but overall in pretty good shape. We ate at Manny's. Me and Ralph was hunting squirrels in this general area when we heard this great rush of air. And we looked up, saw that ship. It was the same one we ran into before. A white flash of light came out of it. Ralph just started running from the Jeep. These two space guys appeared right in front of him and wrestled him to the ground. Then that light hit them again and they was gone. Tell you what, it scared me so bad I had to sit right down and have me a beer right there on the spot. I got pretty lucky after that, though. Caught me six more squirrels. Then I heard this funny little ringing sound. I wasn't quite sure what it was at first. It just turned out to be somebody's pet cat had a little bell on its collar, so I shot it too. Then I heard that thunder clap again, and Ralph hit the ground. He had a concussion, dislocated shoulder. Nothing too serious. So we pitched camp and ate a few of the squirrels. In a moment of confusion Ralph ate the cat. Something was nibbling on my butt. Me and Ralph was on this weekend hiking trip you know, throwing rocks at campers and whatnot. We saw that same ship come up over them bluffs over there. Ralph just started cussing and heading off down the path when this big space guy appeared in front of him and clotheslined him right there at the bottom of the hill. Took him down real quick. Then that light hit them again and they was gone. I was pretty used to it by now, so I just built me a little cooking fire and broke out the Spam. I'd ate me about a can and a half spam when I heard that clap of thunder. So I looked up and around to see where Ralph would hit the ground at. Saw him coming down those bluffs over there. His jaw and legs was broke, and I was pretty sure he had some internal injuries. So I finished up my other can of spam and took him straight to the emergency room. He pulled through though, he's a real trooper. I don't know what's gotten into him lately, though. He just don't want to seem to do anything. Guys might want to be careful, you're standing in poison oak, there. My first sexual experience, I was 12 years old, Shawnee Pines Youth Camp. Ruth Ann was 14. Vacuum cleaner was brand new. What the hell are you talking about? What? Oh, shit. I was shot three fucking times. Excuse me, um, I don't want to alarm anyone, but there's a guy laying in the hall. You might want to call 911. I mean, he's not even breathing. Oh, thanks. [LAUGHING] Yeah, right. Yep, this is where we keep him, Mr. Manac, down here in the deepest, darkest pit of this facility. We have to, otherwise he'd insight a riot with his wild stories. Yeah, this guy is crazy as a-- What? Crazy as-- Yeah, he's crazy as a-- uh. Is he dangerous? Dangerous? This guy wants to know if he's dangerous. You want to know if he's dangerous? Yeah. No, not really. He's just crazy as shit. I mean, you know, he's really crazy. Yeah, he talks a lot of crazy shit. Crazy shit, but I guess you already knew that or else you wouldn't be here. Well, my boss wants the story right from his lips. Oh, you'll get a story all right. Yeah, a crazy story. Crazy. Crazy man, this is crazy shit. Can we just go down now? Is that all right? Absolutely. Rodney, you got a visitor. Get the hell out of here, man. [LAUGHING] Get that damn light out of my face, man. Don't be like that, Rodney. This guy came a long way to see you. [LAUGHING] Come on, we even brought you something to wear. Get out of here with that shit, you honky, dick-bellied, peckerwood. Is that thing necessary? No, but it's a lot of fun. Let-- let me go. Let me go. Calm down, Rodney, god. This reporter just wants to ask you a few questions. Reporter? Why didn't you say so? So you are a reporter? From where? I'm Al Manac from the television show &quot;The Search for Intelligent Life.&quot; Oh, oh, man. That show sucks. Yeah, it does. But I really want to hear your story from your own lips in your own words. What do I get? You get to be on the show. I told you, that show sucks. How about a pack of cigarettes? Deal. What do you want to know, white boy? I want to hear your story. OK, I was hitching a ride across Mississippi and some aliens attacked me, but I got away. That's it? What the fuck, did you think you were going to turn it into a musical? That's what happened. Easy, Rodney. Did he say you were going to be on the show? No. Then shut the fuck up, cracker. So what do these aliens look like? Hard to explain. They were quite horrible. I can draw them if the Dukes of Hazzard here will let me out of this damn thing. Last time I did that you punched me in the nuts. And you deserved it too, honky. I can draw in with my teeth. There's no end to a black man's talents. Give me some paper, white boy. Hello. Hello. You're that guy from the alien show. Yeah, I'm afraid so. You do a good job. I do? But the show blows. I'm Elania Hoffman. Al Manac. You're with that program. &quot;Nation View News.&quot; How's that going for you? Well, it beats running around looking for flying dinner plates, I'll tell you that. No offense. Of course. Your show is just entertainment, barely. &quot;Nation View News&quot; investigates contemporary moral issues with hard hitting investigative journalism and a rigorous zeal for fact finding. That's quite a pitch. God, who am I kidding? That's a super sized load of bullshit. Look, I'm just a working girl trying to advance in my field. I do what I have to do in a male dominated industry. But if I have to sleep with one more executive just to get a decent pay raise I'm going to shoot some limp dicked bastard. Does anyone work in here or what? Yeah, he's in the back. I think some guy might have died back there. Good. So why don't you tell your producers that you want to stop chasing these fictional stories and do something with real bite? You've got to grow up some time. What about women's issues? Do you have an opinion on that? Well, there was this one time. This is a really unusual situation for me. I've never interviewed like this before. I can't seem to find my questions. But regarding life in outer space-- Shut up. [CROWD CHEERING] Do you know who we are? Who are we, girls? CROWD: Women for Worlds United. Women for Worlds United. That's right. And we didn't come down here to be interrogated by no man! I thought you asked me down here. Shut up! [CROWD CHEERING] Do you want to know what Women for Worlds United thinks about contact with alien visitors? Women for Worlds United thinks there will be no contact as long as that dim-witted warmongering males of this planet are in positions of power. And you? Are you asking me? Shut up! [CROWD CHEERING] But-- Shut up. Tear him up, sister. [CROWD CHEERING] Any self-respecting alien with any wisdom whatsoever would look down on this planet and say, this sucks. [CROWD CHEERING] Any clear thinking alien with an ounce of intelligence would behold our planet and wonder how have these mindless human males survived this long. [CROWD CHEERING] Any destiny minded alien with any hope for the future of the universe should come down here right now and blast you men into little charred fragments! [CROWD CHEERING] Thanks for your time, I got to run. If you can't take the heat, get back in the kitchen where you kept us so long, you bastard! [CROWD CHEERING] Damn, that's a good story. I thought you might like that one. Well, I don't have time to wait. I have to give a blow job in an hour. I need some extra vacation days. If you ever get tired of watching the skies, why don't you come on over to &quot;Nation View News.&quot; We keep track of the world so you won't have to. God, I hate my life. Jesus. Hey, honey, what are you doing tonight? Yo, she just deck that dude? Yep. Weird. So can I get your another? No, no it's OK. Hey, is that guy OK back there? Oh, Marty? Yeah he's usually only dead for a few seconds. He'll be back. OK. So listen, I been thinking. I'm good with people, right? I ask good questions, right? Sure, yeah. All right now, listen. I believe in this alien shit, dog, all right. So why don't I try to do what you're doing? You're just what the show needs. Hell yeah, dog, I knew it. Yeah, all right. So you can put in a good word for me, right? As many words as you need. Fuckin' A, dude. Yes. All right. So tell me about the people you work with. Oh, do I have to? Albert. Can I have a word with you? Actually Larry, I'm working on this midget transvestite crop circle thing and I really don't have the time, I've got to go. Oh, nonsense. It will only take a minute. Albert, I'd like you to meet Dick Skyward. Mr. Skyward. Oh, please call me Dick. I'm sure I will. Larry, what's this all about? Albert, have a seat. Albert, Dick is a new employee. He's also a psychic. I think he might be able to help out on your investigations. Whoa, whoa Larry. No offense to you, but I've always worked alone and I just don't believe in psychics. Horse crap. I've seen Dick in action. He's the real deal. And I asked around and I was repeatedly told that if I wanted results I would only be happy with Dick Skyward. I can read a person's thoughts, given enough time and money. And that's why he needs to be out there with you, so he can tell if people are telling the truth or lying to your face immediately. If someone is lying to you then I'll know it, and then bam. Bam? Bam. What the hell is &quot;bam?&quot; Well, it's you know, &quot;bam,&quot; they're lying. And then what, we don't let them on the show? What? Of course we do. I mean, if I took all the liars off this show I'd have nothing but an hour of Max Harmon. Ooh. Hello, and welcome to the &quot;Max Harmon Hour.&quot; I'm your host, Max Harmon. Today I'm going to share with you one of my favorite hobbies, the ancient art of origami. Now origami is a lot of fun and a great stress reliever. Today I'm going to show you a quick example that you can try at home. Now you take an 8 1/2 by 11 sheet of paper. There are all kinds of animals that you can make with origami. You can make an elephant, a horse, a kumquat, but today I'm going to share with you one of my favorites. [PAPER RUSTLING] The bird. Actually, I may have something there, maybe for Showtime. I just don't see the point. Albert, I'm going to level with you. The quality of your work is slipping, slipping. Your material is suffering. I'm the only one who cares about the damn material. Yes. Yes what? Yes. I want you to take Dick out in the field with you. Show him the ropes. Take Dick in hand. I don't want to. I do want you to. -No. -Yes. No. Yes. Wait, I'm sensing something. What is it? Tension. Eh? Did I tell You he's amazing. That'll be $50. Are you a believer now, Albert? Oh, yeah. I believe. I believe I'll leave. Albert. I will have my way on this one. Now you're angry. Damn boy, you're going to clean me out. Excuse me, Max. Al, I'm glad you ran into me. What is this shit that you're giving me to air? I'm really not in the mood, Max. Oh, oh, oh, you're not, huh? Well, let me tell you the kind of mood that I'm in when I have to air some of the segments. I feel like I'm out there in the breeze, swinging like a monkey's nut sack. I don't know if it's going to work or it's going to be a complete disappointment like last night's hooker. You should write children's book. Shut the fuck up. I know you have some, some little bit of control over these stories. What are you working on now? Actually, I'm working on this midget transvestite who found some crop circles down south. That's pretty good. I like that. Let's go with it. You're Max Harmon. Now let's visit the UFO Research Laboratory in Houston, Texas. Golly, what fun. Welcome, my name is Electric Sammy, director of the UFO Research Laboratory. Our job here is to collect physical evidence left behind by alien visitation. This jacket was worn by a man who was abducted and actually taken aboard an alien ship in March of 1984. Fascinating. This wallet was found in a heavily forested area in Indiana. You can see the slight burn marks on the one side here. We feel the owner was incinerated by alien weapons of some kind. And to show just how clever these non-human intelligence can be, they removed all identification. This is a tape recorder that actually captured the sounds of an alien craft landing in a wheat field in southern Ohio earlier this year. The tape, however, was never found. We feel there may have been some alien intervention there as well. I am in hell. Is this hell? Is that what this is? I just want to know where I am, that's all, because-- no, this definitely hell. I got to tell you, dude, this has been the most interesting day I've had since I got my nipples pierced, only with less itching. I honestly don't know what to say about that. Hey man, I'm going to use the can before I start my shift. Sure thing. Watch out for Marty back there. Is he dead again? All right, it's five o'clock, dude. Time for me to hit the streets. You got a card or something? Yeah, sure. All right, I'm going to call you, dude. Me and you, we're going to be a hell of a team, dog. Hell is the word for it. You rock, bro. Thank you for the coffee, Colonel Fleeton. Not at all. Are you nervous? A little. I haven't talked about this before. We don't go live very often. I'm a little nervous, but I think I'll be OK. PRODUCER: OK, we're set to go live for a &quot;Search for Intelligent Life Special Report&quot;&quot; in five, four, three, two-- [THEME MUSIC] Colonel Fleeton, may I call you Timothy? That's fine. Or do you prefer just Tim? No, no, Timothy. OK. I didn't know since Timothy sounds a little feminine. So Timothy, you are a former officer for our Air Force, not our Air Force, but you know, the United States Air Force. Yes, I served from 1965 until 1980. Wow, that's so cool. My mom always said that Air Force guys made great lovers because they really knew how to use the stick between their legs. Do you think that is true? I can't say. So Colonel Fleeton, you say that on numerous occasions while flying around or whatever, you saw some of those-- what do you call them-- UFO things. Yes I was witness to several strange occurrences that I made full reports of. Later, the government classified those documents and they have until this very date-- This is really good coffee. Did you make it? No. Oh darn, I spilled. It's OK, I can keep going. Let me just get this off. So Colonel Fleeton, what do you think these objects are? Well, my breast guess is that they're foreign in nature. Oh, did I spill on that too? Let me just slip this off. Please continue. Well um, when I questioned my supervisors, I received a reprimand that nearly killed my career. It went on-- PRODUCER: Cut. OK, we're out. What the hell? That's it? Thank you for your time, Colonel Fleeton. Thank god. Oh, It's cold in here. Thank you, Christy for that wonderful report. Ah, now, let's check in with Al Manac live in the field. Al-- [GUNSHOT] MAX HARMON: Al? [GUNSHOT] MAX HARMON: Al? MISSION CONTROL (ON RADIO): Commander Lyle, are you reading me? COMMANDER LYLE (ON RADIO): (WHISPERING) Shh. Be quiet, they're back. MISSION CONTROL (ON RADIO): Say again, Commander Lyle, say again. COMMANDER LYLE (ON RADIO): (WHISPERING) I said be quiet, be quiet. They're right outside. Stop transmitting. MISSION CONTROL (ON RADIO): You're coming in very faint, Commander Lyle. COMMANDER LYLE (ON RADIO): Shh, shh, shh, shh. Stop transmitting, they're listening for me. MISSION CONTROL (ON RADIO): Say again, Commander Lyle, say again. COMMANDER LYLE (ON RADIO): Oh, god! Here they come. Oh, you really did it now, you jackasses. I can't believe it. Yeah, here they come. There's Hacker's helmet. Oh, god! What a day! What a day! Oh! Sorry. I got a swollen prostate. No problem. The hell it ain't! Look, I know who you are, and I got something to tell you. Hey listen, I had long day. I got to get out of here. I got to go back to my office. I've been abducted by aliens. I see. They're mean-ass bastards. Well, there have been reports. And now I'm going to tell you all about it. Don't feel you have to if it's private. I never told anyone, but I'm going to tell you now because you're the one who will believe me. I am. You are. It all started in a public toilet in Grand Central Station. Oh, god. The grey bastards ambushed me in the third stall. Not the green ones, they grey ones. They're the mean ones. They implanted this right in my ass cheek. I would have never known it was there, but Brian noticed when we was-- well, what do you think? You may have something here. You think so? You think it's a beacon so that they can call me back for more tests? Ah, the dirty bastards, I knew it. [SOBBING] Do you mind if I keep this? It's yours. [SOBBING] [GASPING] I'll be, I'll be back in a minute. I'm having some chest pains. MISSION CONTROL (ON RADIO): Commander Lyle, Commander Lyle, are you there? We have Dr. Nathan Gombe on his way over. He's the world's foremost authority on North American wildlife. Commander Lyle, are you reading us? You look very familiar. Ah, shit. What I say? [HUMMING] Good god, no! [MUSIC PLAYING] What have I done to you?
