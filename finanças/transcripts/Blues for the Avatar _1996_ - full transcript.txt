[upbeat music] - My sister and I have never been close, and that's gone on for a long time. I think it started, or what I remember, when it started was when I was about 10. It was summertime, it was very hot, humid in New Jersey, and my sister was four years older than me. She was 14, she had a new boyfriend or something like that, and she was suddenly screaming at my father. I was downstairs near the front door of the house and she was saying, "I hate it here. "I hate this house. "I hate you, I hate you mom and dad. " I hate you, wanna get outta here." And she just ran up the stairs and then my father was down at the base of the stairs and he yelled at her to come back down here. So she came down and I was behind my father so I saw her eyes as if they were coming right at me, and they were just like inflamed. I thought they were gonna pop out of her head or something. And she started to fight my father. I couldn't believe it. I'd never seen this before, very little physical violence in my family. But she went at his face with her fingernails like clawing and my father like grabbed her and they were suddenly like wrestling. I was terrorized. And he was on the ground and was like spanking her or something, and he had this kind of sick smile on his face. It's really not even something I like to remember much less talk about. And she then like escaped out the door of the front house, she ran out and he ran after her which was wild because we never did that kind of stuff. We were like a good Presbyterian family in a suburb, and nobody has problems in suburbs, and our problem was now going out the house. And he dragged her back in, physically dragged her back in, and then when she went screaming up the stairs and locked herself in her room. And I started to cry, and my dad, he had that smile on again and he said, "What are you crying about?" And I felt really ashamed [sighs] and so I stopped crying which was kind of like the beginning of sort of faking you know, life, and we got in a car like we were scheduled to do, me and my dad, and we went grocery shopping. And when I got out of the car, it was like the first time I felt like you kinda have to walk around with a veneer. - Well, Dennis called collect again today. I bet those phone bills are gonna be expensive this month. And I'm getting a little, I don't know, agitated about it, maybe just a little bit all the collect phone calls. She's kinda making a mess downstairs too. I'm having a hard time keeping up. Having a hard time kinda trying walk around her clothes and get around her stuff and an awful lot of Coke cans laying around. If she could just clean up her own Coke cans, that would be fine. Of course that doesn't bug me as much as those ashtrays. Well, maybe you can help me clean up a little bit today 'cause I've got an awful lot of laundry to do, and I know I'm gonna have to work. I know you have to work too, but I can't stand living in this mess, it's driving me crazy. [exercise equipment creaking] - You know, show her where the Coke cans go or something. You know, it's not tough. She just kinda got dropped into this situation too and maybe she's not used to having kids around. I don't know I think it's just bugging you more than it really should. It's not that bad. [sighs] [banging] What the hell, what the hell. What's wrong with this thing? Hey, Mary. - Oh, good morning. - TV, something wrong with the TV? What's going on? Is the remote not working or something? Whoever watched that last night. What the heck's wrong with it? - I think it's just been fine. - Well, it's not going on. Something's wrong with it. Come on, come on. I wanna watch some TV. Oh, man, what's going on with it? I mean it was working last night. Is there anything wrong with it? - [Mary] Oh, I unplugged it. - Unplugged it? Why did we unplug the TV? - Well, I thought it was best to unplug it. - Why, why unplug the TV? - Well, I read this report recently that they've been discovering a high rate of cancer in people who are exposed to electrical appliances, and I just thought it would be best if it was unplugged. - Oh. [sighs] - So, I got tattoos. I know what you're thinking. You're thinking, "Oh, is he dirty? "Is he a criminal? "A gangster, a biker, a punker?" I'll tell you what I am. I'm free. I am a free human being. This is my body, these are my tattoos, and I am free to do what I want with myself. You know it's this freedom thing. It's this ability to take life and do what you want that makes me kinda transcend above all you sitting there thinking that if you get this tattoo, what's your mom gonna think, what's my daddy gonna think, what's my boyfriend or girlfriend gonna think? You know I can remember back when I was a small child, and maybe you all can remember back when you were small children, and you reached into that box of Cracker Jacks. I ask you, "What was the best prize you could get "in a Cracker Jack box?" It was the tattoos, of course. Why, why when you were a child, was the best thing you can get those tattoos? What happened when you got older? What happened to that dream of getting a tattoo? Where did it go? For me I am reliving that dream, and I will probably continue to relive that dream. That childhood, that child inside of me, that freedom, that ability to do what I want will always remain in me. And when I fill that goal, I will probably do something else. Now I'm not saying to just go out there and get yourself a tattoo and you're gonna be free because see there's a lot of ways to do this and you have to do it right. You know it's not about getting drunk and going to the nearest tattoo parlor and getting a tattoo that you're gonna hate because it's the only thing you're gonna have forever. You are permanently married to this tattoo. You're not taking this off. You're not divorcing it. It's with you forever. You need to find yourself a good artist. You need to track him down. You need to save your money, and you need to do it and not worry about how much it costs because a good tattoo can have no price. It is art, it is you, it is your body. And make sure, more importantly, that you're gonna like the tattoo [laughs], that you're gonna become older and you're gonna look at that tattoo and go, "You know I still enjoy that tattoo." Get something with a meaning. For instance, a lot of people might think, "Gee Eric, what did your mom say about that tattoo?" And you know what I told her? I said, "Mom, you see this tattoo here? "This is a tribal piece. "You know what this tattoo means to me, mom? "You know what this tattoo symbolizes? "This tattoo is about a native American Indian fisherman "out in the water, who found out from the gods "that his family was in trouble, his mom, his family, "his wife was in danger. "And you know what he did? "He summoned up the gods, he called on the great "orca killer whale to take him home to save his family." [scraping] - [Man] Jane. - [Jane] Hey. - [Man] Hey. - [Jane] So. - [Man] I was wondering where you were. - I've been thinking about it and decided-- - [Man] Thinking about what? - About us, and I have decided that it's not working-- - It's not working? - No, it's not working for me, and I think I want-- - What do you mean? - I mean it isn't working for me and I want you to move out as soon as possible. - How can you say that? - After the other night, how could you say that? - We're getting along great. - Oh, yeah. - I can't believe it. - Yeah, we're getting along great because this is my place, I give you a job, I pay for everything. - Wait a minute, because you have been telling me you haven't been able to talk to a man like you've been able to talk to me-- - Up to a point. - Like you haven't felt the closeness that you've been able to feel that we've had. That's been there from the beginning. What are you talking about that it's not working out? - Right, exactly, in the beginning. - In the beginning, yeah, and now and always. - What about issues of responsibility and you taking responsibility when I try to talk to you about that. - I am taking responsibility, I just put up this barn. Look at this barn, you've got the barn you use. - I paid for all the materials. I provide you with everything. - I've worked my labor here, that's worth something - Yeah, you did, and I appreciate that. - Yeah, and how about all these special times that we've been having together? How about all these walks that we've been taking? - Yeah, what about them lately? What about lately? - Lately we've been doing that. - Oh. - What? I can't believe it, something's going on with you. - The minute something comes up about responsibility, you're not there, you're just not there. - I am there. - You wiggle out of it. - I've taken care of your daughter when you're not here. - She's 14 years old. - Yeah, and she trusts me. - Well maybe I don't, maybe I don't. - For what? - Because you've been taking advantage of me. - That's so weird. Where's this coming from? And I think I know. - Oh, yeah, so what do you think you know? Since you're not listening to me explain why I wanna do this, what do you think you know? - Well, I think there's something else going on for you. - Like what, like my life? - That's what I'd like to know. - My life is going on and you're turning it upside down. I'm tired of taking care of you. I feel like you're being opportunist-- - You're not taking care of me. This is a joint venture here. - Oh right, I had everything when you moved in eight months ago, it's no joint venture. You just kinda wiggled into my life and yeah, you pitch in here, you pitch in there, but when it comes to really making plans together who has to pull it all off? Who has to take action, who has the money, who has the land? - What do you mean? I'm sharing on this too. - You're like someone I could pay someone $7 an hour for the same thing and as far as our personal connection, it's just gone to shit. There's nothing there anymore and you know it, and I think there's something going on with you. - You can't say that, you can't say there's nothing there. - Yeah, I can say whatever I need to say. - No, well, I can't hear it then. I can't believe it then, that you can say that there's nothing between us. How can you say that, Jane? - There's a lot between us, and it doesn't feel right anymore. - You know there's a lot, look at me, you know that. - Well, it doesn't feel right. - How can you say that? That's the thing I don't understand. - Because, every day I think when is this guy gonna like find some direction, but he doesn't. He hangs out in my barn and hammers a few nails. - I have a direction. - Yeah, what is it besides living off me? Anyway, I'm done with it and I have a right to-- - I like being with you, Jane. I mean that feels like a direction to me. - No, it's not enough to get your direction from a relationship. - Can that be enough for me, that's okay. - Well, it's not enough for me. I need to be with someone who's got his own life and who can stand by me and we do things together because he's an individual with his own-- - I'm standing by you. I'm standing by you, I'm standing by your daughter. I'm filling this place. - But every time I don't totally stroke your ego for every little thing you do for me, you freak out, you get mad, I'm sick of it. You should have your own trip that I'm not responsible for. I'm tired of being responsible for whether you feel good or feel bad, whether you're happy or sad whether you have work to do or nothing. I can't handle it, my life was together. - Well, you don't have to be responsible for that. You don't have to be responsible for that. - Oh, yeah, and you give me this big reaction every time I ask for something a little different or when I have a need that's different from what you think of on your own, you freak out. - No, I'm very flexible, I am very flexible. - I think you're deluding yourself. - I think you're wrong. - Look, I know exactly what I'm saying. I've thought about it a lot. It's over, because you've been working on the barn, you've done a good job and everything, I'm gonna give you two weeks in the gypsy wagon, but I want you to stay out of my house and leave me alone. No more coming in at night, no more bugging me. Just leave me alone. [slamming shovel] Watch it. - Just a second, just a second. Let me just say that's fine, that's fine, that's fine, alright? The gypsy wagon is fine. - [Jane] Yeah, two weeks you can handle it. You're a big guy, grow up. - Don't give me that bullshit, alright. - [Jane] It's not bullshit. - I'll stay for two weeks, thank you. - [Jane] You're welcome. [slams shovel] [birds chirping] - I was about four or five living in the country with my parents, and an event happened that totally shook my world apart. I saw my father hit my mother and knock her down and we left him within five minutes. He was on his knees crying, and we left and we in to stay with my grandmother. I remember that day as if it were today. I'll never forget it, and I hated him for that. I hated him for making us leave our house and for hurting my mother and just what it felt like to watch him do that. He eventually asked my mother to bring us back, the family, I had a sister, and we all went back home and he went up to Alaska to do some fishing, and while he was up in Alaska, he didn't send any money home. He was gone for a number of months, and my mother was not working, and it was in a time when women really weren't working much. So she used to take us around from neighbor to neighbor at suppertime hoping they would invite us in for dinner because we didn't have any food. These events had a very strong impact on my life. I grew to despise men for a long time and especially my father and what kind of trouble they caused women and children. I was also growing up as a Catholic and that whole environment was a male-dominated environment and I just felt like god really blew it when I was born a girl because the men and boys they had the world by the tail, I thought. I really wanted to be a boy. I wouldn't have to fear men and I would be able to be an altar boy, I would be able to do so many of the things I couldn't do as a girl. I grew up and dealt with this through many years of therapy of many of these things and really it took me a long time. I'm in my late 30s now until I started coming to grips with my father and who he was and why he did this. I swore that I would never put myself in that type of situation that my mother was in and I never have. I have worked hard since I was in high school. I am actually now retired. I have never had an intimate relationship with a man. My partner today is a woman, and that's the kind of life I have led and chosen to lead probably because of some of those experiences as a child, and watching what my father did. I've never confronted him about this as an adult, but I like him a little more now and I'm not really sure why except he seemed to mellow somewhat. He actually had a heart attack a couple years ago and almost died and it seemed to change him a little bit into being more of a compassionate, kind human being. And I would like to talk to him and say some of these things to him and how he affected me as a child and how that has affected me today, but I probably never will. I just can't imagine how different my life would have been if he had been a little more compassionate and not so aggressive and not so mean and scary. I will never forget one time driving the hay truck and backing up and he was yelling at me, and my sister was in the passenger seat, and I just couldn't deal with it anymore. The truck was still in gear, it was still rolling away. I opened the door, got out of the truck, started walking across the field as it was driving by itself with a load of hay across the field, and he was screaming at me, and I don't even remember why. [knocking] - [Man] Sylvia? - [Voiceover] Come in, hi, come in. - [Man] Hi. - [Voiceover] How are you? - [Man] Okay. - Good to see you. How have you been? - [Man] Well, okay, I guess, but always interested in knowing more. - Okay, well I've been picking up that you're about ready to hear some past life work. - [Man] Really? - Why you came here, what you came to do, what it's all about. So let's get with it. Okay, you wanna start right in? - [Man] Lay it on me. - Okay, give me a minute and just relax. - Yeah, me too, relax. - You just relax. You don't have to do any work. - [Man] Okay. - Umm. In the journey of the soul, each lifetime is a medicine path, and each soul cycle is a medicine completion. You are in the seven part of a complete cycle. A complete cycle is a nine. Imagine this as nine years is a complete cycle, a soul's time that could be 9,000 lifetimes, so just imagine nine years is a complete soul cycle. You are in year seven. Now seven year is a time of culmination, a time of bringing in to understanding because essentially what we're doing here is raising it all, taking all the pain, all the confusion, raising it to wisdom. What this cycle, this particular cycle has been about is to experience the powerlessness, the whole human condition, and what powerless means. - Do you have any waxed paper? - What? - Any waxed paper? I'd just like a piece of waxed paper, please. - [Woman Long Hair] Sure. - Thanks. [paper rustling] I think your baby is an avatar. - [Woman Long Hair] A what? - [Man] Amatar? - An avatar. - [Man] An avatar. - Well, an avatar is a blessed being that has been sent from heaven to lead us into spiritual wellbeing, one of those blessed beings that's sent to us from the heavens to help us with spiritual enlightenment. I do, I do think that she's an avatar. - And how you gonna tell she's an avatar? - Well, that's what's amazing is I've come up with this way to test that I'm sure she is, and that's why I asked for the waxed paper, because if she is, I'm convinced that she'll glow from behind this waxed paper. - [Man] Mm-hmm. - Yes, let's try it. - Okay. - Baby. [paper rustling] - Here, you hold that end and then let's put it right in front of her. - [Woman Long Hair] Do you see anything? - I think kind of, kind of there's, yes, I see it up there. You can see right by her head. - [Woman Long Hair] Oh, I definitely see it. I definitely see it, don't you? - [Man] Yeah, she's an avatar. - [Woman Long Hair] Yes, she is, you're an avatar. [spiritual drum music] [birds chirping] - These are a little small. This weather we've been having, I took it early. It's not a good harvest. - Yeah, it was better last year. - Yeah, we'll be okay. A lot of braids have really good stems on them. So I wanna let you know that I decided to split up with Cheyenne. - You mean do it? - Yeah. - Are you okay? - Yeah, yeah, it was my decision. It just wasn't working very well for me. How do you feel about that? - Well if you feel that it was the right thing to do, then I think it will be fine. - He's been around for a while. - Yeah, I like him a lot but, I grew pretty close to him but... - You could probably tell I was getting kind of obsessed with the situation. - Yeah, I could sense something there that wasn't really right. - Well, I made him a deal that, just to be fair, 'cause he's worked on the barn so much, that he could stay in the gypsy wagon for a couple of weeks, but that I wanted him to not come in the house so when I'm not around, I just wanna be sure he doesn't try to get in through you and so you don't feel put on the spot, just let him handle it. - Okay. - We'll be okay. We'll get someone else to finish the barn and now we'll just go on like we've been doing for so many years anyway, right? - Yeah. - So I'd been dating this woman for about 2 1/2 years in college, and the first six months were fabulous and everything else was just sort of downhill. It had become one of those on-again off-again relationships. This was like right at the very end. This was actually turned out to be our last date. We'd gone out to this Chinese restaurant 'cause it was her favorite thing to do, and I'd actually dressed up that night, which I never do. I had to put on this nice sweater my mom had just bought for me. And so we go to the restaurant and, of course, we start to fight again. And it was just like the whole night just started bad from the beginning. So we just left and she hadn't eaten anything. She had brought her food with her in the styrofoam bag and we just get back into my car and we're heading home, we're still fighting. At one point, she even made me pull over the car, she got out, she left. I had to follow her for a couple blocks, get her back in the car so I could at least take her home. And we pulled back into her driveway. We were still fighting, and at this point she gets out of the car and just heads right into the house. So now I know what I'm supposed to do is to follow her into the house to finish the fight, because we had had fight about that before, how we were supposed to fight, right. I'm supposed to stick to her until the fight's over. And so I'm thinking what can I do to really piss her off? So I just rolled down my window and I go, "So am I supposed to follow you in now or what?" So she's like 20 feet away. She turns around and just gives me this gleam, kind of like... I knew I was in trouble. She starts walking at me, food like this. I go for my windshield, my window, and I miss it, right. And I grab it again and I'm racing to get this thing up and she just takes the food and bash, all over me, all over the inside of my car. I never got my car cleaned after that. And so I start the car, I start backing up, and she grabs my sweater, she's yanking at my sweater. She's just tearing at it. And she goes, "Kyle, would you like to come in?" And she's just pulling me and pulling me and pulling me. And so I backed up into the street. She's still holding on. I'd backed up about 20 feet, and there's this huge hill that I'm gonna go powering up. I had this Chevy Mailbu, a V8, a power car, right, and so I thought it would be polite to say I'm pulling away now or something so I say, "I'm leaving." I step on the gas, just go ripping up this hill, and she did let go. I was ready to drag her at that point. I was pretty shaken up. I go home and my mom and my sister, they're having coffee at the table, and I tell them the whole story. And they just say to me, "You don't know how lucky you are "you don't have scars on your face right now." This woman and I we didn't talk really for about six months after that. Finally I saw her at her wedding, and she could actually talk to me again, but that was my worst breakup. [cards swooshing] [clicking] - It looks like your major theme this week is around trust and having to trust situations in which you have to open your heart, and feel protected in doing that but it seems as if you have some emotional issues around this. So this is the card of trust. And in life, as you can see, it has a fluid motion to it. It's not something that's rock solid or stable and we have to go with the flow in life and in relationships. We can't always have everything the way we want. It looks as if there's a woman who is a earth sign, a virgo, taurus, or a capricorn, who is someone that you are mistrustful of, and it's looking as if you need to realign yourself with this and understand what your relationship with this person is all about. - In 1954, I was in the ninth grade. There wasn't anybody smarter than I was or any of us, and we got a new PE teacher. He was a Korean War veteran, Marine Corps drill instructor who decided, I think, to take an easier job teaching. His name was Jack Crouse and he scared the wits out of us, all of us. He'd walk into a room and people would be quiet. You would quit goofing off, and we all had the same PE teacher, so we had to get Crouse and it was, I mean scary stuff. One look from him and you'd stop whatever you're doing. And we knew that he'd been in the war and was yelling like Jack Webb did in the movie the D.I. And what he did, I was doing my Walter Brennan imitation one day, which was sort of like walking like an old man all hunched over, and he spotted me doing this and walked over and he said, "I suppose you think that's so goddamn funny." I said, "What?" He said, "There are people that can't help "walking like that." So I didn't think anything about it. There was an assembly there that afternoon and because I was an almighty letterman I got to stand in front of the assembled groups and direct traffic. That was part of the benefits of getting a letter in baseball. So I was standing out there, so I did it again, thinking it was awfully funny that I could do Walter Brennan. And he caught me again doing it. The next day in PE he brought me up in front of the entire class and said, "Don here is gonna imitate somebody for you, "a person with cerebral palsy. "Come on out, Don, and do it." So I thought he was kidding, you know, but he wasn't. He made me come out there and do that, and I've never done the imitation since, so I'm not gonna do it now. Secondly, Crouse took the heaviest kid in the ninth grade, Lee Dalton, and we had a thing in PE where you'd have some poor guy on the floor with his knees up and you would come roaring for him, put your hands on his knees, and the guy on the floor would push you over. So he asked for volunteers and, of course, nobody volunteered, so he said, "Christianson, you're on the floor." And Johnny Christianson wasn't more than like five feet one. He put him on the floor and he said, "I need a demonstration tumbling guy here. "Dalton." So he got Dalton who is at least six feet four, and about 250 really loose pounds, and sent him over. Nobody thought anybody would make it. Dalton did a fairly decent job. He didn't crush Christianson on the floor. The point of it is is that Dalton made it, Christianson made it, and we all made it after that. I thought it was kinda neat. I made it myself. I never forget old Crouse. I went up to his house one day afterwards, and we were like older kids. He looked out his curtain like this at us. It was dark, and I still got scared. And I shouldn't be afraid when you're that old. Actually he's a good friend of ours now. In contrast to Evelyn Burton, an English teacher I had who told me that I was not even college material, that I should probably get a job learning how to weld. That was my advice as a senior. Told me I couldn't take Lit 4. These are the kinda things that stick with you, when you're going to a 35th reunion in two weeks. So I dropped out of Comp English, English for College, didn't get to take Lit 4, didn't get to study Chaucer, but I got to take a class called Family Life which taught me how to feed babies and cook. I went in the army, got out, went back to college, went into English 101, and managed to get an A. So I thought this is my golden opportunity, to go back with my grade thing, it was 4.5 or an A in English, I hadn't gotten that many good grades ever in high school, to show Mrs. Burton that she was wrong and that I was right. And I went back to Everett and found out that she had died about three weeks earlier. So I'm still waiting to show her that thing. Maybe she knows I got the A, I don't know. It isn't that important now. But I'll show you the last thing, a watch my mother gave me. It says, "Mom to Don 1958". It still works. It's approximately 4:25, and it's the only watch I've ever had. I'll never forget Jack Crouse though. I think he's still alive. I know Mrs. Burton's dead and I'll be dead someday and I'll probably see her then and I'll tell her I got an A in English. How do you like that? [squeaking] [footsteps rustling] - Okay, look, I've had it. You get up tomorrow morning. Don't wait for her to get up. Go out to that camper, don't even bother knocking. Don't wait for her to come to the door. Rip that door open if you have to. Drag her out of there, throw her and her shit in the car and drive to that ferry. Don't stop along the way where she can get out, and don't leave until you see her go away into the distance on that ferry. I've had it, this is it. - Oh, that is so typical, so typical. All week I have been trying to tell you, help me deal with this, help me get through it. But no, you wait until you're all the way back to work and now I have to deal with it myself. You're telling me deal with it, get rid of her, put her in the car, right. You take her, you put her in the car, you do it. You handle it. I have other things to do. So you see you saw the paper I brought in. Did you get a chance to look at it? - Oh, hey, thanks for bringing that. That was nice of you. Yeah, I started reading that front section, that really good article on the travel section. - Did you look though the homes and real estate section at all? - No, I haven't gotten to that part yet. - Well, it has places for rent you know in Seattle you can look in there and it'll tell you apartments and houses and such and then you can call the number and find out how much they are and if it's the area that you like, you've done that before, haven't you? - Well, I'm just kinda waiting on Dennis for that. - But he's not gonna be here for a while. - Oh, I'm sure he's gonna call soon though. - Yeah, but he's not gonna be here for a while. - Well, you know there's really no hurry and I think I'll just wait 'til he calls and we can talk a little bit about it then. - Well, maybe we could kinda figure out kinda what place you wanna get. Have you kinda thought about what kinda place? Apartment? - You know Dennis is so particular that I just really kinda wait, you know, and there's really no hurry. - Maybe a little house? - Um, I don't even know what we can afford really. - Well, maybe I could kinda help you get some kind of an idea. - Well, you know I just kinda feel like we should just give it a little time and I'd like to just feel what it's like over in this neighborhood and then wait 'til I hear from Dennis and take it from there. - Well, he's kinda gotta be in the city sort of, isn't he? Maybe you should think about being somewhere in the city closer to downtown maybe or maybe close to the ferry so you could walk on and off the ferry? In case you wanted to come out here it would be a lot easier. - Yeah, well, you know we really didn't even talk about it and I just don't wanna rush it right now. I'm really comfortable here and it's just been so great. You've let me move in here and it's so cozy and it's given me a little time for myself even. And then when Dennis calls we'll just put it together and figure out what we wanna do. - Well, you know sometimes you have to put a deposit down or put a wait on something, sometimes you gotta wait, if some stuff isn't available like 'til the first, maybe we should kinda start looking sort of, maybe just kinda take a look. Maybe you want to go to Seattle and check out Seattle. - Hmm, I really don't like to ride the ferry too much and [sighs] I'm just real comfortable here right now until Dennis shows up and then we can drive around together. - You don't like to ride the ferry? I could drive you around. We could go out to Tacoma. That's not too bad of a drive. - Hmm. - I'll take you in my convertible. We could go for a ride in the convertible. You might like that, it might be fun just for the day. - Well, [sighs] the garden's coming up here, I've got a lot of things I just feel like doing now and really there's no hurry. I've been told there's places that come up all the time and it'll just work out. - Well, I think you really need to start to figure out a direction which way you really wanna go. I'd be happy to help you whatever it takes. - Well, you've been great, I know and-- - Well, no, I'm happy to help you more. - I don't want you to have to do anything more. I can just hang out here, things are fine, and then when Dennis shows up, we'll get it together and then we'll figure out where we wanna live. I won't cost you very much. I can eat from the garden. It's doing really well this year, so it doesn't cost much for me to be here. - But that could still be a couple months down the road. - No, I'm convinced that Dennis is gonna give me a call. - Hi. - Hi. - How's it going? - It's going okay. - I need some help with the baby inside. - All right. - Now. - Okay. - One day I was wandering in my vicinity, and I found an artificial leg completely dressed in shoe, stocking, and I thought what an interesting find it would be to take back to my house and put up as a fence post on top of a fence post as found art. [clears throat] A while passed, and sitting in the backyard one day I heard someone clear their voice and I looked up to see a Monterey County Sheriff, full dressed policeman pointing at my garden. In the garden, I had six-foot pot plants growing just beyond the vision of the artificial leg, and he was stammering and I got up to see what he was talking about, all the time tasting adrenalin and he was pointing at, I thought my garden, but actually he was pointing at the artificial leg, saying, "Where did I get it?" Well, I explained where I'd gotten it, and he said, "Well, that's my mother's leg." And as he explained to me, his mother died of cancer and some kids, I guess, had gotten into her house, she had been a neighbor of mine, which I didn't know, and they'd strewn her stuff all over the back alley and that's when I found the leg. My first reaction was, "Oh, god, what have I done?" I said, "Well, I'll get it for you." So I turned from the policeman and said, "Just let me get it." All the while I'm walking toward this artificial leg that's sticking straight up in the air, and I'm convinced that at any moment I'm going to be in jail because within his field of vision are these beautiful marijuana plants. So anyway I reached the leg, my heart pounding, and I'm retrieving the leg, walking with it hand in hand and I hand it to him and he thanks me for it, and proceeds to get in his car and drives off with this artificial leg. After that, I immediately pulled up all the plants and I'm not sure if I could flush them or what I did with them. It was a very tense moment in my life. Another story occurred. When I was in high school or just out of high school, I decided to have a party to celebrate it, and about 60, 65 people came to this party, and everybody was having a good time, patio, inside, fire inside, barbeque outside. Everybody was milling around and at one point I turned around and my mother, who was a very heavy drinker, wished to appear and mingle with all of my friends completely naked. I looked at her and obviously she wanted a fight over this. She wanted me to pick her up and take her to her bedroom. I declined and left my party and went to a different party which I then proceeded to have a wonderful time. [ethereal music] - Tasha. - Mm-hmm. - I like that ring. - Oh, thanks, my mom gave it to me. - Really? - Yeah. - Birthday? - Christmas. - Nice. - Well, thanks. [sighing] - Um, has your mom said anything recently about me? - Well, what do you mean? - I don't know, you know, whatever. - Not really. - She talks to you though about stuff though? I mean like you guys seem pretty close. - Yeah, we talk a lot. - Hmm. [sighs] She was out late. - [Tasha] Yeah, I came in at like 11 and I didn't hear her. I went right to bed because I was tired and so I woke up this morning and she was here so... - Oh, good, so she was home. I wanna show you something in a minute. Have you ever seen that before? - [Tasha] No. - She gave me that when we first met, when we kinda saw each other like we'd seen each other forever, you know, and it was kind of like our relationship. I mean this was like, I don't know how to explain it to you, but anyways I woke up last night and the crystal had fallen out of this thing. [sighs] I just knew. [tinkling] I just need to tell you this, I don't know. Maybe somehow you'll understand or something. I guess I've never been that great with women. But the funny thing about it is, I feel like I can't live without a woman. I don't know what it is. I feel like I don't have enough. Well, anyway, when I met your mother, it was in London, and I had just come in from New York, I had terrible jetlag at Heathrow and I was so lonely. I was just so lonely and this whole trip was to, I don't know, because I've always been searching for god too and I just had this kind of message that I was supposed to be in Jerusalem for Christmas. So I sold everything I had. I was living right here in this town, and I sold my car, everything, to get to this Israel for Christmas. So I landed in London, I'd just seen my parents and that just makes me feel lonelier than ever and so it's like with parents it's like I'd just spend the whole time just feeling lonelier and lonelier. I just wanted to meet somebody. So I got off at the airport and sure enough, I put on my backpack and there's this American woman and we're talking. It was your mother. I couldn't believe it, she said, "You wanna share a hotel room together? "It'll save us money." And I said, "Sure." I don't know, it was like when we got into the bedroom, it's kind of a dingy hotel in some Iranian district, or Indian, there's all these Indians all in these cheap hotels in London, well, anyways, we're in this room, this small room, a single bed, and I felt like a little boy. She just kind of undressed me, slowly, and I mean we hadn't even kissed yet. [laughs] I don't even think I knew her name. This instant, it was like a feeling I'd never had before, I just felt so safe all of a sudden, like it's gonna be okay. Like I'm not gonna die or something. I don't know. I just got all, I mean because it was so safe. I don't know, it's like with other women it had always been so in a hurry, hurry the hell, you know just get going, and like let's see what you got there, buddy. And there wasn't any of that at all. [peaceful music] [birds chirping] [laughing] Marriage, two children. Rich and famous. Oh, god, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex, sex. [sighs] Dumps men fast. Long life, that's good. Meet her now, yes. - She was gonna leave yesterday. She was gonna leave the day before. She's still here, I have had it. Tomorrow morning, you're gonna get up, pack those bags, put her in the car, and drive to the ferry, and don't stop and let her out anywhere. Get her on that ferry, she's out of life. I've had it. It's getting between us, it's messing things up, it's gotta happen tomorrow. - She's got to leave. I just can't take it anymore. [jazz blues music] [car revving] [seagulls calling] [water rippling] - So I'm kind of like in the middle of this story right now. It's been really hard to know when to make a change, knowing that at some point I had to leave basically something that I was very much committed to and very much I'd given basically over nine years of my life to, and yet knowing psychically and spiritually that I just had to give up that to do something different in my life and so I most recently have resigned from publishing, a job that has been pretty much my entire life and I for the past couple years kept thinking, I've got to move on, I've got to move on, because I was giving so much to bringing other people's work out into the world and yet I knew somehow that the silence within me would either be a time for me basically be not silent anymore within myself. And yet I couldn't do it because I just couldn't do it, and I kept thinking the time would come and so a few months ago, I helped put in this film festival here in town and then the next day after that, actually a couple days after that, I had dinner with some friends and basically spent the whole night crying. That's kind of when things, it was like, okay, it's time for me, I know I gotta make this change because I'm starting to cry and I'm the sort of person I don't cry a lot. I spent that night after they left alone and then got up really early in the morning and went swimming and it was like I was swimming and I'm crying and I'm thinking I gotta go. I just gotta leave this situation. Even though I love what I'm doing, there's something in me that I've gotta break from that. And yet I still couldn't do it, and so it's like you never know when the time is and I kept thinking somebody could help me with this, and yet I knew the decision had to come down to myself. Finally after another period of a lot of crying on the beach and then Roger coming home and I'm just crying and Roger saying, "Look, you just listen to yourself, it's okay." And yet I'm so like frightened of what the future's gonna bring, I don't have anything like this is what's gonna happen in my life. It's just like I know I've gotta make some break. So I just fell asleep and Roger was holding me and I was crying and finally I just got up at six in the morning and went in and wrote a resignation and left it on the the desk, and split, and went into the pool and went swimming. It was really amazing. It was like the first time I had noticed, I swore I had never seen these roses before. It was like all of a sudden I was feeling more like just alive. I was seeing things. So I went swimming and it was great and I went home and I packed my bags and I took off and I went to this old dock and I went swimming for the rest of the day and then took off to the ocean and drank a bottle of champagne and got smashed and felt like this is it, I've made the right decision. So I don't know what's gonna happen. I mean it's really kind of... They really would like me to stay at the press and yet I feel like I just gotta take a chance. I don't know how I'm gonna support myself. I don't know what's gonna come but it's time so I did it. And I'm kind of still in the middle of my story. [birds chirping] - So I don't know, I guess that was like the beginning of being scared of my sister, really scared. I saw her like, I don't know, just really evil or something. I didn't realize at that time why she was so justified in being like she was. So we didn't talk much. So actually fast-forwarding up to now, I haven't spoken with her for a couple years, and today's a very special day 'cause she wrote me. So this is the letter. "Dear Cheyenne. "I hope I can get through this. "I feel relieved just to have begun this letter "but still don't know what to say "or how to say it "and writing is something so difficult for me anyway "so I guess we've both been angry at each other "for different reasons, but equally important reasons. "And resolution is always difficult but especially "with separation, not just manifest "in our disparate opinions and needs "but in actual physical distance. "I was so touched by the earrings you sent me." I sent her a birthday gift. "I have them out and have looked at them daily "and thought of you, intending to write, "and guilt that I haven't, "but I am now. "Can we just drop this and go on from here?
