( silence ) TESTING, TESTING. ONE, TWO, THREE. TESTOSTERONE, TESTICULAR CANCER, "TESS OF THE D'URBERVILLES." Man OKAY, WE'RE SET. PARTY MONSTER, TAKE ONE. Man # GOOD, SO WHY DON'T YOU START AT THE VERY BEGINNING? A VERY GOOD PLACE TO START, IF YOU SAY SO. I THINK IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO BEGIN WITH A BANG, DON'T YOU? LET THEM KNOW SOMETHING HORRIBLE'S GOING TO HAPPEN AND THEN, POOF... WE'RE SUDDENLY ELSEWHERE. MICHAEL ALIG'S BLOOD FEAST PARTY. JUST A QUIET NIGHT OUT WITH A FEW FRIENDS. ( laughs ) THAT'S MICHAEL, EXHIBIT A, KING OF THE CLUB KIDS. WHAT A MESS. HE USED TO BE SUCH A SWEET KID. MICHAEL, I HATE YOU FOR MAKING ME SAY SERIOUS THINGS, SO I WILL ONLY SAY THIS ONCE. YOU'VE GONE TOO FAR WITH THE DRUGS. HAVE YOU LOOKED IN THE MIRROR LATELY? EXHIBIT B, MOI, THE YOUNGER PRETTIER ONE. I WAS GOING TO WRITE THE GREAT AMERICAN NOVEL. BUT INSTEAD, I FOUND MYSELF PLAYING THE SIDEKICK IN A SICK AND TWISTED BUDDY MOVIE. JAMES, ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE NOT THE ONE THAT'S A MESS HERE? ( laughs ) James OKAY, GUILTY AS CHARGED. BUT THINGS WERE ABOUT TO GET A WHOLE LOT MESSIER. SO COME WITH ME NOW ON THE LAST NIGHT OF MY LIFE, THE NIGHT OF MY OVERDOSE. YOO-HOO, ANYBODY HOME? THERE YOU ARE. - YOU LOOK AWFUL. - SO DO YOU. SO, HOW'S THE NOVEL COMING? WELL, I'VE DONE ANOTHER PAGE. BUT NOW I THINK I MIGHT HAVE WRITER'S BLOCK. TWO PAGES IN FIVE YEARS? Michael COME. WE'LL TAKE OUR TEA IN THE BEDROOM. SO... NOTICE ANYTHING DIFFERENT? THE FLIES? NO, SERIOUSLY, JAMES. ANYTHING OR ANYONE MISSING? LIKE A DRUG DEALER THAT USED TO LIVE HERE? WELL, DARLING, THAT COULD BE ANYONE. CAN I BUY A VOWEL? THINK. ( snorting ) I KNOW, ANGEL. WHERE IS ANGEL ANYWAY? - I KILLED HIM. - OF COURSE YOU DID, DARLING. OH, HOW I HATE HEROIN. NEW SHOES? OH, THEY'RE ANGEL'S. HE WAS WEARING THEM AT THE TIME. OF COURSE HE WAS, DARLING. AND THAT'S BLOOD ON THE TOE, RIGHT? I DIDN'T MEAN TO. IT WAS SELF-DEFENSE. JAMES? JAMES? JAMES? OH, TYPICAL JAMES. TIRED OLD DRUG ADDICT. CAN'T EVEN STAY AWAKE FOR YOUR OWN MOVIE. NOT THAT IT'S YOUR MOVIE. YOU THINK IT'S YOURS, BUT IT'S REALLY MINE. ALL MINE. ( harp playing ) HI, I'M MICHAEL. I GREW UP IN THE MIDWEST. USUAL STORY, FELT DIFFERENT, REALLY DIDN'T FIT IN. BUT I WASN'T GOING TO TURN THE OTHER CHEEK. NO SIREE. I STARTED SELLING CANDY IN SCHOOL, JACKED UP THE PRICES SEVERAL HUNDRED PERCENT. THIS IS MY MICHAEL. HE WAS ALWAYS MAKING MONEY. HE JUST-- HE HAD A KNACK FOR IT. MY LITTLE CANDY MAN. Michael LET'S SEE, WHAT ELSE? OH, ONCE WHEN I WAS , MY SUNDAY SCHOOL TEACHER TOOK ME BACK TO HIS HOUSE. HE TAUGHT ME HOW TO FRENCH KISS, AMONG OTHER THINGS. HE REALLY TOOK MY BOY UNDER HIS WING. VERY NICE MAN. HIS MOTHER CAUGHT US IN THE BASEMENT AND SHE SCREAMED, "I TOLD YOU NOT TO BRING THEM HERE!" AND HE SAID, "DON'T, YOU'LL FRIGHTEN HIM AWAY." ONE NIGHT MICHAEL GAVE ME A GOOD NIGHT KISS THAT A LITTLE BOY SHOULD NOT GIVE HIS MOTHER. I THOUGHT EVERYONE KISSED LIKE THAT. SO LIKE ANY SMALL TOWN BOY I HAD BIG-TIME PLANS. SO IT SHOULD COME AS NO SURPRISE THAT I ENDED UP IN NEW YORK CITY. ONE DAY I REALIZED I DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE TO GET UP IN THE MORNING AND GO TO WORK. I DIDN'T WANT TO BE LIKE ALL THE DREARIES AND NORMALS. I WANTED TO CREATE MY OWN WORLD, A WORLD FULL OF COLOR, WHERE EVERYONE COULD PLAY-- ONE BIG PARTY THAT NEVER ENDS. NO, NO, NO! FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, NO. WE ARE NOT GOING TO START WITH MICHAEL ALIG'S PATHETIC CHILDHOOD-- "I WAS MOLESTED." ( mock crying ) I HAD A HARD TIME GROWING UP, TOO. - ( toilet flushing ) - AND I DREAMT OF BIGGER AND BETTER THINGS. AND I MOVED TO NEW YORK CITY BEFORE HE DID. I, I, I WAS THE ORIGINAL CLUB KID. SO, NOW THAT THAT'S SORTED... A FEW SIMPLE RULES OF NEW YORK NIGHTLIFE IN THE EARLY 's ? NEW YORK, NEW YORK ? ? NEW YORK, NEW YORK... ? James RULE NUMBER ONE PERCEPTION IS REALITY. SO WHEN YOU'RE GOING NIGHTCLUBBING, NEVER MERELY ARRIVE, ALWAYS MAKE AN ENTRANCE. ( horn honks ) RULE NUMBER TWO MAKE SURE YOUR OUTFIT WORKS IN BLACK AND WHITE AND THAT IT'S A CONVERSATION PIECE, EVEN IF YOU ARE THE ONE DOING THE TALKING. IT'S BLOOD FEAST FOR JUNE BRIDES. GET ME TO THE CHURCH ON TIME. ? YOU'LL BE FAMOUS... ? OKAY, RULE NUMBER THREE WATCH OUT FOR PUSHY, OBNOXIOUS LITTLE BUSBOYS WHO DON'T KNOW THEIR PLACE IN THE SCHEME OF THINGS. HI, I'M MICHAEL ALIG. WELL, I'LL ALERT THE MEDIA. GOTTA DASH. James OH, IF ONLY I HAD TOSSED HIM ASIDE. BUT I'VE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO RESIST MINISTERING TO LIFE'S LOSERS. - YOU'RE LATE. - I KNOW. I REALLY SHOULDN'T HAVE COME AT ALL. THAT'S MY DOUGHNUT. WELL, I DIDN'T EXPECT TO BE DINING AT THE FOUR SEASONS. - WHAT DO YOU DO? - I DON'T DO. I JUST AM. EXTREMELY RICH. ANYWAY, IF I'M TO STAY IN THIS ROACH MOTEL A MOMENT LONGER WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO TAKE THINGS UP A NOTCH. - I DON'T DO DRUGS. - NOR DO I. DID YOU SEE THAT? IT JUST FLEW RIGHT UP MY NOSE! - MY MOTHER SAYS DRUGS ARE FOR LOSERS. - SHE'S SO RIGHT. KETAMINE HYDROCHLORIDE, A.K.A. SPECIAL K, IS MAINLY USED BY VETS AS AN ANIMAL TRANQUILIZER. WHEN TAKEN BY HUMANS IT WORKS AS A DISSOCIATIVE DRUG SELECTIVELY REDUCING EXCITATION OF THE CENTRAL MAMMALIAN NEURONS BY N METHYL ASPIRATE. IN OTHER WORDS, IT FUCKS YOU UP! I WANT YOU TO TEACH ME HOW TO BE FABULOUS. ( scoffs ) WE HAVE NOTHING IN COMMON. WAIT! WE BOTH BITE OUR NAILS. PLEASE, DON'T GO. I DON'T HAVE ANY FRIENDS. I JUST GOT HERE. I JUST GOT OFF THE BUS. "THE ROAD OF EXCESS LEADS TO THE PALACE OF WISDOM." BLAKE, WILLIAM. THAT'S REALLY ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW. THAT AND "DON'T DREAM IT, BE IT." "ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW." IT'S MY FAVORITE. AND WILL YOU SIGN MY COPY OF "SLATED"? YOU LOOK SO GOOD IN IT. FLATTERY WILL GET YOU EVERYWHERE. James IT'S ALL ABOUT PHOTO PLACEMENT. SO IF YOU'RE IN A GROUP OF THREE, ALWAYS, ALWAYS, ALWAYS MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE THE ONE STANDING ON THE RIGHT. THAT WAY WHEN THEY PRINT THE PICTURE, YOU'LL BE THE ONE ON THE LEFT AND THE CAPTION WILL READ "JAMES ST. JAMES AND BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, WERE SEEN, OKAY? OKAY, RULES OF PRESS NUMBER ONE NO PUBLICITY IS BAD PUBLICITY. NUMBER TWO ONCE SOMETHING IS PRINTED, IT AUTOMATICALLY BECOMES TRUE, SO NUMBER THREE NEVER, EVER DISH ANYONE IN PRINT. NEVER BE SEEN DRINKING ANYTHING OTHER THAN CHAMPAGNE AND NEVER TAKE HEROIN. NEVER WEAR WHITE AFTER LABOR DAY AND OH, AVOID THAT ONE LIKE THE PLAGUE. MORE! MORE! OKAY. OKAY. THE ART OF WORKING A ROOM UPON MAKING YOUR GRAND ENTRANCE, TAKE YOUR PARTNER BY THE HAND AND CIRCLE AROUND THE ROOM, SMILE AND SAY HELLO TO EVERYONE IN THE ROOM, EVEN IF YOU DON'T KNOW THEM. ESPECIALLY IF YOU DON'T KNOW THEM. - HI! HI! - HI! HI! I'M SO GLAD YOU CAME. - I KNOW YOU. - HE'S FABULOUS. GO ONCE AROUND THE ROOM IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS. GO CLOCKWISE TO MY ANTI-CLOCKWISE. TELL ALL THE PEOPLE HOW YOU'VE LOST YOUR FRIEND AND HOW DESPERATE YOU ARE TO FIND THEM. WHERE CAN MY FRIEND BE? NOW, SUDDENLY WE BUMP INTO EACH OTHER AND SCREAM WITH UNCONTAINED JOY. ( both screaming ) GOOD, NOW LINK ARMS AND ROUND WE GO ONCE MORE TELLING ALL OUR NEWFOUND FRIENDS HOW WE'VE FOUND EACH OTHER. - WE FOUND EACH OTHER. - DON'T WORRY, I FOUND HIM. THEN LEAVE. THE WHOLE THING SHOULD TAKE AN HOUR. MINUTES TOPS. DO THAT ONCE A NIGHT FOR THREE MONTHS AND YOU'LL BE THE TOAST OF THE TOWN. HEAVENS, IS THAT THE TIME? MY SANSKRIT CLASS. WAIT, WAIT! I DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY AND AREN'T YOU GOING TO TEACH ME HOW TO THROW A PARTY? HOW ABOUT LEARNING TO CRAWL BEFORE YOU WALK? TOODLES! James BUT MICHAEL WASN'T INTERESTED IN LEARNING TO CRAWL OR WALK. JUST RUN, RUN, RUN. ( techno music playing ) I WENT TO HIS FIRST PARTY. UNFORTUNATELY. THERE IS NO ONE HERE. CHRISTINA'S HERE. ? FIRST I'M GOING TO WHIP YOU ? ? THEN I'M GOING TO EAT YOU... ? SHE'S FABULOUS. ALL I COULD THINK ABOUT WAS HOW I WAS GOING TO BE RUINED LOOK, JAMES, THIS IS GOING TO BE MORE THAN A CLUB. IT'LL BE-- IT'LL BE LIKE OUR HOME. FOR EVERYONE WHO FELT LIKE A FREAK, EVERYONE WHO'S EVER BEAT ON OR SPAT ON IN HIGH SCHOOL, FOR EVERYONE WHO FELT DIFFERENT. IT'LL BE LIKE THE FACTORY AND I'LL BE THE NEXT ANDY WARHOL. EARTH TO YOU, ANDY WARHOL IS STILL ALIVE AND WELL. IN FACT, I JUST REMEMBERED I'M SUPPOSED TO MEET HIM. WAIT, DON'T GO! DO YOU WANT A COCKTAIL? HERE. - I HAVE DRINK TICKETS. - DRINK TICKETS? ( laughs ) YOU OBVIOUSLY COULDN'T EVEN ORGANIZE A GLASS OF WATER. - OH YEAH? - YEAH. ( gasping ) ( laughing ) James YOU CRAZY FUCK! THAT WAS QUITE A STUNT... FLOODING MY BASEMENT. ( giggling ) I'M SORRY. WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME WHAT YOU INTEND TO DO ABOUT IT? YOU NEED ME TO PROMOTE THIS PLACE. I COULD MAKE IT FABULOUS. NOT IF TONIGHT'S ANYTHING TO GO BY. IT'S NOT ME THAT'S TIRED, IT'S YOUR CLUB. NO ONE WANTS TO COME HERE. Man IT'S A STATEMENT. THE DAMAGE DONE TO THE CLUB WILL BE REIMBURSED FROM YOUR EARNINGS FROM THIS PARTY AND THE NEXT TWO PARTIES THAT YOU THROW. WOW! A JOB. - YOU WON'T REGRET THIS. - WE'LL SEE. I LOVE THE EYE-PATCH, BY THE WAY. IT'S VERY "PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN." ARR! HE LOST IT. WHATEVER. YOU SHOULD COME TO MY HOUSE. I'LL COOK FOR YOU. YOU'LL LOVE MY MEATLOAF. YOUR ASSISTANT CAN COME, TOO. OH, I'M SORRY. MY HUSBAND IS A VERY BUSY MAN. BESIDES, WE DON'T SOCIALIZE WITH THE EMPLOYEES. YOU'LL LOVE ME. I PROMISE. Michael HEY, CHRISTINA, I'VE DECIDED TO MAKE YOU MY FIRST SUPERSTAR. ( giggling ) COME TO MY PARTY. COME TO MY PARTY. HERE, COME TO MY PARTY. COME TO MY PARTY. COME TO MY PARTY. COME TO MY PARTY. OH, DUDE, THANK YOU SO MUCH. YOU CAN BE MY BOYFRIEND. OH, ACTUALLY, I'M-- I'M NOT GAY. I'M ACTUALLY HERE WITH A COUPLE OF BABES, SO-- LET'S TALK AFTER A COUPLE OF COCKTAILS. DRINK TICKET? OH, THANKS, DUDE. ? YOU ARE MY DISCO PLAYING ON THE RADIO ? ? YOU ARE MY DISCO... ? I HAVE TONS OF THEM. ? PLAYING ON THE RADIO, YOU ARE MY DISCO ? ? OH, YOU ARE MY DISCO ? ?

BUT JAMES, YOU HAVE TO COME. YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND. HOW CAN I BE YOUR BEST FRIEND WHEN I DON'T EVEN LIKE YOU? HAVE YOU MET KEOKI? WELL, ALOHA. HOW ABOUT A LEI? ( laughing ) I'VE ALWAYS HAD A SOFT SPOT FOR HAWAIIAN PUNCH. HIS NAME IS KEOKI AND HE'S MY NEW BOYFRIEND. - MMM. - TOODLES. TOODLES? COME ON. WAIT, IT SAYS HERE THAT I'M THE MC. TAXI! SO, WHAT DO YOU DO? I'M A BAGGAGE HANDLER, THANK YOU, - AT KENNEDY AIRPORT. - WELL, NOT ANYMORE. FROM NOW ON YOU'RE SUPERSTAR DJ KEOKI. REALLY? - COOL. WOW. - TAXI. YOU KNOW, I NEVER THOUGHT I'D BE RIDING A CAB THROUGH THE BRONX WITH A GUY. YOU KNOW, I FIGURE COME TO THE CLUB AND TELL A COUPLE OF GIRLS NO, NOT TONIGHT. BUT I NEVER THOUGHT I'D BE-- YOU KNOW...

LIKE A RECORD, BABY, RIGHT ROUND, ROUND, ROUND ? ? YOU SPIN ME RIGHT ROUND, BABY, RIGHT ROUND ? ? LIKE A RECORD, BABY, RIGHT ROUND, ROUND ? ? I WANT YOUR LOVE... ? Keoki WHOA! - ( both laughing ) - ( cat meowing ) Keoki WHAT WAS THAT? IT'S A KITTY. IT'S OUR LOVE CHILD. WE'LL CALL HIM SKRINKLE. James AS YOU DRY YOUR EYES, LET ME JUST SAY THIS ABOUT THAT. SKRINKLE WAS JUST THE BEGINNING. SKRINKLE BEGAT SKRODDLE, AND SKRINKLE AND SKRODDLE WERE THE LEGO BLOCKS OF A STRANGE NEW WORLD HE WAS BUILDING FOR US ALL. YOU WERE EITHER A SKRINK OR A SKROD. I WAS A SKRINK-LA DA IF I WAS GOOD. OR A STUPID SKROD LOVER IF I WAS BAD. SOMEHOW HIS DOPEY LANGUAGE CAUGHT ON. LIKE HIS STUPID PARTIES. ( drum roll ) THE WINNERS OF MICHAEL ALIG'S FIRST KING AND QUEEN OF DOWNTOWN CONTEST... CHRISTINA SUPERSTAR AND KEOKI THE IT BOY. CONGRATULATIONS. ? THEY ONLY WANT YOU WHEN YOU'RE ? ? WHEN YOU'RE YOU'RE NO FUN ? ? THEY TAKE A POLAROID AND LET YOU GO... ? James HE WAS TROUBLE ALL RIGHT. MICHAEL WAS OUT FOR REVENGE. THAT'S WHAT I LIKED ABOUT HIM. ( whimpering ) ( laughing ) MICHAEL WAS GROWING ON ME, LIKE A FUNGUS. HOW ELSE TO EXPLAIN HOW HE GOT ME TO HAUL MY ASS ABOVE th STREET TO HIS SIXTH FLOOR WALK-UP IN THE BRONX ONE CHRISTMAS EVE? THE NORTH POLE. I'VE MADE IT ACROSS THE FROZEN TUNDRA. MY FAITHFUL HUSKIES PERISHED IN THE BLIZZARD WAY BACK. I HAD TO EAT THEM. ( James laughing ) KEOKI, WOULD YOU BE A LAMB AND RUB MY EXTREMITIES? I FEAR THEY'RE FROSTBITTEN. JAMES, I WANT YOU TO BE ON YOUR BEST BEHAVIOR BECAUSE TONIGHT I'VE INVITED A VERY IMPORTANT SURPRISE GUEST. LET ME GUESS, CHRISTINA. AND SHE'S GOING TO CHOP US ALL UP AND SERVE US AS FONDUE. I KNOW WHAT PIECE I WANT. KEOKI, COULD YOU CARVE THE TURKEY? YOU KNOW I CAN'T BEAR TO. DARLING, HALF THE FUN OF EATING MEAT IS HACKING IT UP. - ( door buzzing ) - JAMES, CAN YOU GET THAT? Radio ? Think of all the fun I've missed... ? HELLO. YEAH, RIGHT THERE IS FINE. ? Next year I could be just as good ? ? If you'd check off my Christmas list... ? MICHAEL. ? SANTA BABY... ? HA! MERRY CHRISTMAS, KID. OH, PETER, THANK YOU. THANK YOU, PETER. ( giggles ) IT'S SO... BIG. ( clock ticking ) KEOKI, WILL YOU PUT SOME MUSIC ON? YES. JAMES, THERE'S CHAMPAGNE ON ICE IN THE FRIDGE. IT'S SUCH A SHAME YOUR WIFE COULDN'T COME. BECAUSE I'VE BEEN THINKING, I'VE DECIDED IT'S TIME FOR ME TO START THROWING MY OWN WEEKLY PARTY AT LIMELIGHT ON THE MAIN DANCE FLOOR. YOUR PARTIES BARELY BREAK EVEN. I HAVE TO LET ALL THESE PEOPLE IN FOR FREE. I HAVE TO GIVE THEM FREE DRINKS. MICHAEL, I DON'T MAKE ANY MONEY OFF OF YOU. PETER, WILL YOU STOP BEING SUCH A NEGATIVE NANCY? PEOPLE WON'T BE SEEN DEAD IN YOUR CLUB. I'M JUST STARTING TO GET A BUZZ GOING. ( Michael continues talking ) "O, WOULD THAT I WERE A GLOVE UPON THAT HAND..." - HUH? - "O, SPEAK AGAIN BRIGHT ANGEL." YO, MAN, I'M WITH MICHAEL. MY ONLY LOVE SPRUNG FROM MY ONLY HATE. MAN, I CAN'T FIND A RECORD TO PLAY AND I KNOW IT'S A SPECIAL NIGHT FOR MICHAEL. YOU'RE RIGHT. IT IS. ... GIANT ANIMAL COSTUMES LIKE ICY THE POLAR BEAR AND CLARA THE CAREFREE CHICKEN. AND TO MAKE THINGS REALLY SIZZLE, WE'LL HAVE A HOT BODY CONTEST. KEOKI WILL BE THE DJ, OF COURSE. IF YOU ARE GOING TO BE A SUPERSTAR DJ THERE ARE THREE SIMPLE RULES YOU NEED TO REMEMBER. NUMBER ONE YOU CAN ALWAYS RELY ON THE STUDIO COMPILATION SET. THEY'RE PRE-MIXED, THEY LAST FOR HOURS. AND NUMBER TWO MADONNA ALWAYS WORKS. AND NUMBER THREE WHEN ALL ELSE FAILS, PLAY TECHNO. IT'S NON-DESCRIPT, NON-RECOGNIZABLE AND EVERYONE WILL THINK THAT YOU ARE SO CUTTING EDGE. OH, I LOVE THIS RECORD. IT'S SO... DISCO . ( snorting ) YOU PATHETIC, DRUG-ADDICT LOSERS! MICHAEL, I AM NOT ADDICTED TO DRUGS, I'M ADDICTED TO GLAMOUR. Michael YOU, JAMES CLERK, YOU SHOULD BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELF. HOW DARE YOU USE MY REAL NAME. AND MICHAEL, YOUR CHAMPAGNE-- CORRECTION, YOUR SPARKLING WINE, TASTES LIKE PISS. ( laughs ) SO WHERE WAS I? OH YEAH. SO WE'LL PUT JAMES IN A CAGE AND HANG A SIGN OVER IT THAT SAYS "DO NOT FEED THE DRUG CHILD." IT'LL TRANSFORM LIMELIGHT AND NEW YORK NIGHTLIFE FOREVER. IT'LL BE MORE OUTRAGEOUS THAN ANYTHING BEFORE IT. NEW STARS, NO RULES, ANYTHING GOES. EVERYONE WILL WANT TO COME. MICHAEL, AREN'T YOU LISTENING TO ANYTHING I'M SAYING? YES SIREE, BUT THIS WILL WORK. ( unzips pants ) ( urinating ) ( sighs ) I'D STAKE MY LIFE ON IT. - Peter YOU'RE CRAZY. - ( disco music plays ) AH, JAMES, KEOKI. JUST IN TIME TO TOAST TO... DISCO . Peter TO DISCO . ? CALLERS AS THOUGH THEY WERE CHRISTMAS EVE ? ? DISAPPOINTED BUT I DON'T KNOW WHY ? ? SHE GAVE ME LAUGHTER AND HOPE ? ? AND A SOCK IN THE EYE ? ? IN MY YOUNG LIFE AND I KNOW SOMETHING NOW ? ? I'VE NEVER TRIED TO CREATE A WOW ? ? WOWS ARE FEW, FRUSTRATION MORE COMMON... ? ( laughing ) James MY SOUR GRAPES WERE HIS SWEET WINE. DON'T ASK ME HOW, BUT IT CLICKED. ( dance music playing ) SUDDENLY THE HATEFUL LITTLE TURD WAS THE KING OF THE CLUB KIDS. I HAD TO ADAPT OR DIE. BEHIND ME, THE CHOICE OF THE NEW GENERATION-- WEIRD CLOTHES, WILD MAKE-UP AND NO PARTICULAR SEXUAL PREFERENCE. CLUB KIDS OR CLUB BRATS? YOU DECIDE. THEY HOLD ILLEGAL OUTLAW PARTIES IN SUBWAYS AND THEY TAKE ECSTASY, A DRUG KNOWN TO CAUSE BRAIN DAMAGE IN RATS. THE ROAD OF EXCESS LEADS TO A PALACE OF... FABULOUSNESS. I'M ELKE, MICHAEL'S MOM, AND I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THAT ANYONE CAN BE A CLUB KID. - IT'S ECSTASY. - ( crowd cheers ) ( changes channel ) - I WAS WATCHING THAT. - FAGGOT. ? TELL ME, TELL ME ? ? TELL ME, TELL ME, TELL ME, TELL ME ? ? TELL ME, TELL ME, TELL ME, TELL ME... ? - ALL ABOARD. - ( cheering ) HOW DO YOU LIKE MY U.F.O.? ( laughing ) OH, DEAR GOD, NO. MICHAEL! ( engine revving ) MICHAEL, I HAVE TO TALK TO YOU. NOT NOW, WE HAVE TO GO BEFORE THE POLICE GET HERE. - GET IN. - BUT, MICHAEL! Michael I'M FINE. HELLO. WHAT'S YOUR NAME? - I'M ANGEL. - WELL, WHERE'S YOUR WINGS? - MICHAEL! - HUH? CAN YOU HELP US GET THIS DOOR CLOSED? YOU HAVE TO DO IT FROM THE OUTSIDE. BUT IF I DO THAT I WON'T BE ABLE TO COME. IF YOU DO THIS NOW, YOU'LL BE ONE OF US. NEXT TIME I'LL MAKE YOU V.I.P.-- VERY VERY IMPORTANT PERSON. - MICHAEL! - COME ON NOW. BE AN ANGEL. - MICHAEL, YOU'RE OUT OF YOUR MIND. - OH PLEASE. - PARTY IN THE TRUCK. - ( cheering ) ( sirens wailing ) ALL RIGHT, COME ON. ( Christina giggling ) LET'S GO, SWEETIE. YOU'RE A BIG GIRL. GET UP. ALL RIGHT. ( dance music playing ) James MICHAEL, I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU BOUGHT ALL THIS CRAP. Michael OH, JAMES, DON'T BE JEALOUS. I'VE GOT A LUXURY CONDO AND YOU DON'T. ALL RIGHT, EVERYONE, IT'S MY BIRTHDAY. TIME TO PAY ATTENTION TO ME. - HAPPY BIRTHDAY. - THANK YOU. - HAPPY BIRTHDAY, BABY. - OH, KEOKI, HOW NICE OF YOU TO SHOW UP AFTER WHAT, FOUR OR FIVE DAYS? YOU'RE FUCKED UP, AREN'T YOU? EVERYONE, THIS IS FREEZ. HE USED TO BE A HAT-MAKER, NOW HE'S A DRUG DEALER. EVERYONE SAY HELLO. MICHAEL, PLEASE. HA! FUCKING JUNKIE. OH, IS THAT FOR ME? HOW LOVELY. TAKE IT, YOU LITTLE FUCK! ( record scratches, music stops ) HEY, DON'T TOUCH MY RECORDS, MAN. YOUR RECORDS? DON'T MAKE ME LAUGH. YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO PLAY. YOU'RE NOT A SUPERSTAR DJ, YOU'RE A PIECE OF SHIT DJ AND EVERYBODY KNOWS IT. WELL, CONGRATULATIONS ON GETTING OUT OF THE VERY DANGEROUS WORLD OF HABERDASHERY. OH, DRUGS ARE JUST A SIDELINE. PROFITABLE, THOUGH. MAY I SAMPLE YOUR WARES? ( thunder cracks ) ( music box playing ) MICHAEL, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? SKRINKLE AND I JUST DID ALL YOUR COCAINE. YOU DID WHAT? I FIGURED IF YOU WERE GOING TO RUIN OUR RELATIONSHIP BY DOING DRUGS I SHOULD SEE WHAT ALL THE FUSS IS ABOUT. GREAT, SO NOW WE HAVE TWO DRUG ADDICTS IN THE FAMILY? AND SKRINKLE MAKES THREE. DO YOU HAVE ANY MORE? WHAT DO YOU MEAN, "ANY MORE"? MORE AS IN MORE, MORON. WHAT PART DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND, DUH-FACE? FUCK YOU. I'M OUT OF HERE. YOU'RE JUST MAD 'CAUSE I DID ALL YOUR STUFF AND I DIDN'T EVEN LIKE IT. IF YOU WALK OUT THAT DOOR I'M GOING TO KILL MYSELF. ( door slams ) ? TURN AROUND ? ? EVERY NOW AND THEN I GET A LITTLE BIT LONELY ? ? AND YOU'RE NEVER COMING ROUND ? ? TURN AROUND ? ? EVERY NOW AND THEN I GET A LITTLE... ? WAKE UP, MICHAEL. YOU CAME. ? EVERY NOW AND THEN I GET A LITTLE... ? THESE SUICIDE ATTEMPTS HAVE GOT TO STOP. WE ALL KNOW THAT YOU'RE FAR TOO SELFISH TO EVER HURT YOURSELF. JAMES, HOLD ME, PLEASE. I FEEL COLD INSIDE. ? EVERY NOW AND THEN I FALL APART ? ? TURN AROUND, BRIGHT EYES... ? OKAY, JUST THIS ONCE. I JUST WANT TO BE LOVED. THERE ISN'T ENOUGH LOVE IN THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD TO SATISFY YOU. WELL, KEOKI'S ALL I NEED. I KNOW WHAT YOU NEED-- A NICE HOT CUP OF HOT CHOCOLATE. CAN YOU PUT SOME ECSTASY IN MINE? WHAT? SINCE WHEN ARE YOU INTO DRUGS? ECSTASY ISN'T A DRUG, SILLY. IT'S NOT EVEN A LISTED SUBSTANCE. IT'S JUST MEDICATION FOR MY RAPID-CYCLING BIPOLAR DISORDER. PEOPLE SAY WE'RE SUPERFICIAL. WE ARE. PROFOUNDLY SO. WE'RE TWO PEAS IN A POD, YOU AND I, JAMES. PITY THE POD. YOU'RE THE YODA TO MY LUKE. EXCUSE ME. YOU ARE THE PAULA ABDUL TO MY JANET JACKSON. THAT'S GOOD, RIGHT? DID I EVER TELL YOU ABOUT MY FIRST BOYFRIEND IN JUNIOR HIGH? I THINK YOU'RE ABOUT TO. CUE THE MUSIC. ( soft piano plays ) WHEN I WAS WE WERE INSEPARABLE, HIM AND I. SO THAT WE WOULD NEVER HAVE TO BE APART WE CAME UP WITH THIS PLAN THAT HE'D KIDNAP ME AND MY BODY WOULD NEVER EVER BE FOUND. WE SPENT DAYS PRACTICING TO SEE HOW LONG I COULD SPEND IN CONFINED SPACES. ON THE DAY BEFORE THE KIDNAPPING HIS FATHER FOUND US WRESTLING. AFTER THAT, HE NEVER TALKED TO ME AGAIN. I CALLED HIM LAST NIGHT, AFTER KEOKI LEFT. HE'S MARRIED NOW, WITH KIDS. HE WOULDN'T EVEN COME TO THE PHONE. HIS WIFE HUNG UP ON ME. I REALLY THINK YOU SHOULD MOVE IN WITH ME, JAMES. I'M JUST LIKE A BALLOON, UNLESS SOMEONE HOLDS MY STRING... I'LL FLOAT AWAY. GOOD, IT'S SETTLED THEN. WE'LL GO GET YOUR STUFF LATER TODAY. ( cuckoo chiming ) ( Michael whistling ) Michael OUR MAGAZINE'S ON THE STANDS TODAY. CAN YOU BELIEVE IT? OUR OWN MAGAZINE. I'VE ALREADY SEEN IT. AND THERE'S A PROBLEM, A BIG PROBLEM. I'VE BEEN CUT OFF. "JAMES ST. JAMES HEADS UP WHITE SLAVE RING. SELLS -YEAR-OLD BOYS ON AVENUE B. EXCLUSIVE BY MICHAEL ALIG." WHY, MICHAEL, WHY? COME ON, SKRINK, I THINK IT'S FUNNY. ( scoffs ) MY FATHER DOES NOT SHARE YOUR SENSE OF HUMOR. I DIDN'T KNOW HE WAS A "PROJECT X" READER. YES YOU DID, BECAUSE YOU SENT HIM A LIFETIME SUBSCRIPTION. AND NOW I'VE BEEN CUT OFF WITHOUT A PENNY. SO NO MORE TRUST FUND AND NO MORE GAULTIER AND NO MORE FUCKING COMMES DES GARCONS, MICHAEL. WELL, AT LEAST YOU HAVE A FATHER. MICHAEL, FOR ONCE, THIS IS NOT ABOUT YOU. LOOK, JAMES, I'M SORRY. I'LL TALK TO YOUR FATHER. I PROMISE. LOOK... WHY DON'T WE MAKE A PACT, OKAY? THAT WHENEVER YOU'RE DOWN, I'LL HELP YOU, AND WHENEVER I'M DOWN, YOU'LL HELP ME. IT'S KIND OF LIKE A SEESAW. EXCEPT NEITHER ONE OF US CAN GET OFF. ( laughs ) ? I-I-I-I-I need ? ? I need you ? ? I-I-I-I-I-I Need... ? COME ON. COME ON. ? I-I-I need, I need you ? ? Two of hearts ? ? Two hearts that beat as one ? - ? Two of hearts ? - ? I need you, I need you ? ? Two of hearts ? ? Two hearts that beat as one ? ? Two of hearts, come on, come on ? ? I-I-I-I-I need ? ? I need you ? ? I-I-I-I-I need ? ? I-I-I-I-I need ? ? I need, I need ? ? I need you. ? WHAT'S FOR DINNER, JAMES? I'M STARVED. I FINISHED THE MOST MARVELOUS SENTENCE TODAY. THAT'S GREAT. WHAT'S FOR DINNER? I'VE BEEN WORKING ON IT FOR TWO WHOLE WEEKS. THE RHYTHM, THE SYNTAX, THE DISSONANCE, THE DIPHTHONGS-- IT'S PERFECT. ( clears throat ) "LAST NIGHT I DREAMT OF GLOCCA MORRA... AGAIN." IT'S REALLY A SHAME YOU CAN'T PUBLISH A SENTENCE. I'M CONVINCED IT WOULD BE A BESTSELLER. ( bell ringing ) ( James humming ) ( sizzling ) LIGHTLY TOASTED ANIMAL TRANQUILIZER EXPERTLY PREPARED BY YOUR SOUS CHEF. - DID KEOKI CALL? - NO. HE PROMISED HE'D CALL. WE'LL SEE HIM NEXT WEEK IN DALLAS, IF HE BOTHERS TO SHOW UP. ( laughs ) YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU NEED A NEW PROJECT, SOMETHING TO KEEP YOU BUSY. I KNOW, WHY NOT CREATE A NEW SUPERSTAR? A SUPERSTAR DRUG DEALER. THEY'D BE INSTANTLY POPULAR BECAUSE DRUG DEALERS CAN AFFORD THE BEST OUTFITS AND EVERYBODY LOVES DRUGS. THEY WOULD GIVE YOU ALL THE DRUGS YOU WANTED FOR FREE. AND IF THEY DIDN'T, I'D JUST THEM RIGHT OUT OF THE CLUB. - DON'T SPILL IT. - MICHAEL, YOU'RE SUCH AN ADDICT. - ( phone ringing ) - THAT'LL BE KEOKI. HELLO. NO. JAMES, NO DIPPING INTO THE COOKING SHERRY! YEAH. OH, OKAY. YES, YES, THANK YOU. BYE. WAS THAT KEOKI? WHAT DID HE SAY? DID HE ASK ABOUT ME? IS SOMETHING WRONG? IT WASN'T KEOKI. IT WAS THE POLICE.

COME ON, LET ME DO YOUR MAKE-UP. WE'RE GOING TO BE LATE. LATE? HOW COULD YOU EVEN THINK ABOUT GOING OUT? I'VE BEEN PLANNING THIS PARTY FOR MONTHS. - CHRISTINA HAD NO RIGHT TO GO AND DIE ON US. - YOU GHOUL. OH PLEASE, THE BEST SUPERSTAR IS A DEAD SUPERSTAR. - STOP IT. I MEAN IT! - ( Freez screams ) MY FUCKING BUTT IS ON FIRE! ( laughs ) COME ON. LET ME DO YOUR FACE. WE'RE GOING TO BE LATE. HI. WELCOME TO CHICKEN BUN. MAY I TAKE YOUR ORDER, PLEASE? YES, I'D LIKE CHEESEBURGERS AND FRENCH FRIES, PLEASE. ( hitting keys ) WILL THAT BE TO STAY OR TO GO? TO STAY. WILL THERE BE ANYTHING TO DRINK WITH THAT? HOW ABOUT ONE OF YOUR THICK AND CREAMY MILKSHAKES? MY NAME'S RODNEY. YOU CAN CALL ME ROD FOR SHORT. HELLO, ROD. ( cheering ) DINNER'S SERVED. DON'T BE SHY. OH, I'M SORRY. CHRISTINA'S DEAD! RA LA DIDDLE DOO! ? YOU GOT TO WALK ? ? WALK ? ? WALK YOUR ASS DOWN THE RUNWAY, JETWAY ? ? WALK, WALK ? ? MODELING IS AN UGLY BUSINESS... ?

( weak laughter ) CLUB KIDS, SO WHAT DO YOU ACTUALLY DO? WE DON'T DO, WE JUST ARE. BUT WHAT ABOUT WORK? IT TAKES A LOT OF WORK TO LOOK THAT RIDICULOUS. WELL, MY WINGED VALKYRIE... - HOW DO YOU SUPPORT YOURSELF? - WELL I-- CAN'T YOU GUESS? HE'S A DRUG DEALER. - ( audience gasps ) - ( Michael laughs ) - NO, BUT SERIOUSLY? - IT'S ALL JUST INNOCENT FUN. THEY'RE NOT HURTING ANYONE. LET THE CHILDREN PLAY. WE'RE PARTYING WITH THE CLUB KIDS, FAMOUS BECAUSE THEY'RE FABULOUS. THAT'S SO COOL. Man AND WE'RE CLEAR. - MICHAEL, WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN? - IN JAIL. NO, MY BABY BEHIND BARS? ME AND RODNEY HIJACKED AND CRASHED A CAB. - ANGEL BAILED ME OUT. - ANGEL? ACTUALLY, ANGEL BAILED YOU OUT. ME? YEAH, I TOLD THE POLICE I WAS YOU. OH, JAMES, IT'S JUST ALL IN FUN. AND AFTER I TOLD THEM THAT YOU HAD AIDS THEY GAVE ME MY OWN ROOM WITH A VCR AND ICE CREAM. ( laughing ) MICHAEL, I DON'T EVEN LIKE YOU. I HAVE NEVER LIKED YOU. Man WE'RE BACK IN FIVE, FOUR, - THREE. - ( theme music plays ) SO, JUST WHAT IS A CLUB KID? IT'S ALL ABOUT SELF-EXPRESSION. IF YOU FEEL LIKE A TROLL, THEN YOU SHOULD LOOK LIKE A TROLL. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT YOU LOOK LIKE. I MEAN, IF YOU HAVE A HUNCHBACK JUST THROW A LITTLE GLITTER ON IT, HONEY, AND GO DANCING. - AND YOU ARE? - HE'S A TROLL. TROLL ST. TROLL. I AM JAMES ST.
