What was that noise? - The blacksmith's squealing pig. A pig cannot squeal that loudly. Hooray! Albert is born! Yippee! He can already talk and wiggle both ears! Hey! Albert? Yay! You can already walk! You are so clever! Hey, come and see! - What is it? - Look what he can do! Oh, what a clever boy! And big. - Yeah. 21, 22... He's growing with every step he takes. That's my boy! What was that? And he's just grown! Again! My! He's so strong and clever. Soon he'll be able to do everything himself. What's that? It's Mommy's big strong boy! And clever. Let me have a look. Can you believe it? I think he's grown again! Of all the nuisances in the world, boys are definitely the worst! Dear citizens, I am deeply saddened to inform you... ...that Kelly Town is now a town without a statue. This statue was the pride of the town... ...a memorial to our amazing hot-air balloon captain Leopoldus. Since the boy was responsible for ruining the statue... ...the boy must supply us with a new one. He's only a little boy. By the way, his name is Albert. Yeah, he can do that when he grows up. You are so sweet! Well, in that case, it's settled then. I can only wish that Albert... ...could get us a real hot-air balloon captain... ...to once again make Kelly Town proud, rich and famous. Oh, do you remember that, honey? Of course. Amazing how fast he grew. And started school... ...with his best friend Egon, the little rascal! Yeah! But Albert was never friends with Palle, was he? Oh, no! Oops! The shoemaker's pear tree! Here comes trouble! That shoemaker's as bitter as his pears are sweet! Ooh! Look at those two boys! They are totally inseparable. Yeah, they must be the best friends in the world. - Pirates' club! - Hot-air balloon club! - Pirates' club! - Hot-air balloon club! - Pirates' club! - Hot-air balloon club! Pirates' club! It was always a hot-air balloon club. But we don't have a hot-air balloon! We don't have a pirate ship either or cannons! And you need those! Otherwise you're not a real pirate! But what sort of club should we have, then? We can just have a scoundrel club. Scoundrels don't need cannons. What's a scoundrel? It's a bandit! And what do they do? They smoke cigars and drink. Then I don't wanna be part of that club. I'd be grounded forever. OK, but what, then? Maybe we could kidnap somebody. Great idea, Egon! That's exactly what scoundrels do! Maybe we can catch girls and stick them in the basement. Do we have to kiss them? Ew! Are you completely insane? Real scoundrels can't stand girls! There's Judith. Let's take her. Are you crazy? What about her mother? - We'll scare her away! I wouldn't dare do that. What if she screams? - We will flee! That is what scoundrels do. Come on! - Attack! Attack! Look, Mom. I go to school with them. The funny-looking one with the glasses is Albert. Don't talk about other people like that. Remember, beauty comes from the inside. I heard that! Just you hang on! Aren't they funny, Mom? You're right. They look very funny. But also really rather dirty. But can I stay and play with them? Ah, certainly not! They probably have fleas. You seem to always cause trouble. Didn't you also ruin the statue, little one? Come along, Judith. See you later! Did you hear that? She called me "little one" and patted me on the head. I told you, we should have formed a pirates' club instead, Albert. No one would call you "little one" then. People in this town don't like me because of the statue. I know how we're gonna change that, Egon! Come on! Nah, nah, ne, nah, nah! Then I said... Attention, attention! Everybody, listen up! Gather round! People of Kelly Town, I'm all grown up now... ...and I wanna make up for my awful mistake. By "mistake", I mean when I knocked the statue down. Yeah. It's about time. Ta-da! Well, I never! Wait. I think those might be my underwear. And they're my boots! And now! Egon, start the engine. Now for the icing on the cake! - That cheeky rascal! - At last! Kelly Town has a statue with a great big hot-air balloon! What? That's my belt! I'm gonna get you, Albert! They were my underwear! Naughty boy! - Albert? - Yes? What were you thinking? Do you call this correcting your mistake? Dear friends, people of Kelly Town... ...that was just a small taster. You mean there's more? Not only will you get a statue, no! Kelly Town needs a real hot-air balloon captain. So I'm going out into the world! Yeah! And when I return... Ah, don't tell me! I'll no longer be Albert. I will be Balloon Captain Albert, Kelly Town's home-grown hero! That's our big strong boy! He is so, so smart and clever! Of all the nutcases that ever lived in this town... ...Albert is definitely the nuttiest. I thought we were buddies. Of course we're buddies. What are you talking about? But you're leaving me. Such nonsense! You're coming with me. - No way! I'm only coming if we can be pirates. But... but I can't leave without you, Egon. You are my best friend. Well, you'll have to because I'm staying here... ...and that's that! - Well? - Hi, Palle. So, you wanna be the captain of a hot-air balloon? You've always been full of hot air! Hey! You're just one of those small goofy guys... ...with a cotton ball for brains! So, listen, you little squirt, I rule this town... ...and in this town I make the rules up... ...I rule that you are ruled out! - Give me. And if you don't like it, then tough! Did you get that? I don't want any trouble, especially from you. Are you being dumb or just cheeky? Just dumb. Ah, so you are just cheeky. Now I'm gonna show you how we deal with belt thieves like you. You won't be captain of a hot-air balloon any time soon! And if you try to run, you'll get what's coming to you. Darn! Why does some big bully... ...always make life difficult for us little ones? It's not fair. There's a boy in your hen house, sir, and he's up to no good. Well, I never! How dare the little rascal! - Egon! - Come on! I'll show him! He'll regret this! I'll teach you not to let my chickens out. Those chickens cost good money. Always up for one heck of a big surprise! What? So that's what you think, you long lazy beanpole! I'm not that easily fooled! Come on! - Watch the hairdo, man. In the whole wide world, there's nothing worse than boys! Wrong! Broccoli's far worse! When I am done with you, buddy... ...then I will build a fence twice as tall around my garden... ...so none of you cheeky boys can get anywhere... ...near my pears and chickens, you hear me? When you and I return in a hot-air balloon, buddy... ...then we will fly right over that tall fence. Right, Egon? Don't you ever listen to what I'm saying to you, Albert? I don't wanna go, OK? Yeah, yeah, but I thought... Best ever! Don't you want a pancake? You know your mom makes the best ones in the world. I'm not hungry. What? Well, you always love your pancakes. - What's the matter, honey? - Nothing. Albert, did something happen with Egon? Did you have an argument? More than an argument. Albert, you are the world's smartest boy. You understand that others can have a different opinion to yours. Everybody disagrees sometimes. But he won't go out into the world with me. Maybe he's afraid of the unknown. He just needs time to think about it. Just wait a few years. Then he'll probably wanna come along. I can't wait that long. Good night. I'm going to bed. Yeah, he has a bright future, our big strong boy. I gotta think of something. Egon has to come with me. Got it! Eew! Yuck! It really stinks of rotten fish. I wish it smelled more like candy. But I have to get Egon to come with me... ...and now I have a way. What? So... Thought you could trick Palle... ...and slip out of town without your punishment? Well, you can forget all about flying in a hot-air balloon. Why do you always have to ruin everything? Just because it's lots of fun! Is it because you're jealous? Jealous? Me? Of a little squirt? Ha! I may be smaller than you... ...but I'm not the one getting my ears pulled by the shoemaker. How about I teach you a little lesson, small fry? Wanna take a shot? Wait a... - Mamma! - Yeah! I've got you now! Oh, no! Come back here! I'm gonna get you! And when I do, you better watch out... ...cos you're gonna really get what's coming to you! Every summer Every boy's tummy Is filled with lots of yummy Yes! And a very good morning to you! Will you pinch me, Albert? I think I'm dreaming. - At your service, sir! What have you done, Albert? Where am I? - You are on an adventure... What were you thinking? I said I didn't wanna go! - Yeah, but I just thought... ...you'd wanna come anyway. - You kidnapped me! You don't kidnap your best friend! Pirates do! And you get to wear my best bandana. Here. So, what's the plan? I already told you. We're going to look for a hot-air balloon. How about we look for pirates' treasure? Then we can buy a hot-air balloon! - No, we gotta steal it. People with hot-air balloons don't wanna sell them. It's totally obvious. No! The barrel's leaking! We're sinking! Quick! Let's scoop it out! Alright. Now, listen carefully. We have to go rob this diamond. And, fellas, if you don't remember the plan... ...we will definitely end up in prison! OK, so I will yell and make a big fuss. And then the bald man will run after me... ...because he will think that I'm gonna steal his diamond. Correct! Folks that's got incredibly large diamonds... ...tends to get incredibly nervous... ...and thinks everybody else wants to steal them. But, what about me? Oh, for goodness' sake! What you gotta do, Einstein... ...is sneak into that tent and steal the diamond! But why do I end up with the most dangerous stuff? Why can't you just steal it yourself? Because I'm taking care of the big dangerous watchdog. You total numbskull! And besides, my muscular physique... ...means I'm too big to crawl through the bars... ...of a display case. What now? - I'm too big as well! We all are! That's probably because you two spend so much time... ...stuffing your faces! OK, I'll give you 20 Dollars. Each. But even if you gave us 500 Dollars each... ...we'd still be too big. What is a poor man supposed to do? I'm surrounded by fools! Who is that? Goodness! Quickly, you lazy nitwits! Catch those two little guys! They can crawl through the bars! - I'll get 'em, boss. I got 'em! Help! I can't swim! Help! I can't either! - Oh, you let 'em get away! Help! Must I do everything myself? Hold this. Hello? - Quiet! I'm thinking here. Gotta find me another two kids. But we're right here. A wise and clever little guy! And you have come to help the big and strong Rapollo! Are you a pirate? No, but I am a different sort of a pirate. Like a pirate that robs people on the road and not on the sea. No, no, silly. Silly boy! I am a pickpocket. The world's greatest pickpocket, in fact. Oh, boy, what's going on here? Eugh, you stink! Oh, you stink of rotten fish! Yeah. Our ship was a barrel for herring. We've gone out into the world to become pirates. That is exactly the kind of fella I'm searching for! We're OK! We're... We're not OK. Could you teach us how to steal a pirate's treasure? I can teach you how to steal the world's biggest diamond. It's actually my own diamond. But a nasty man with a striped shirt stole it from me. Well, if he stole it from you... ...then Egon and I will help you steal it back. - We need money. Can we get some? - Yeah! Massive amounts of money. But hold on. What do two little guys like you need masses of money for? We need to buy a hot-air balloon. A hot-air balloon! Of course! All smart boys need a hot-air balloon! But we'd better hurry to the market... ...which happens to be where the diamond is. But hold on. It's also a pretty good place to buy a hot-air balloon. What now? Come on, you lazy anim... Oops. I'm thirsty. And I'm bursting to go! Be quiet, you numbskulls! You have to wait till we get to the market! When we get to the market, we're gonna get... ...the world's very best pancakes. Not true! My mom's are the best in the world! That reminds me. I didn't get to say goodbye to my mom and dad. That's your fault, Albert. - My fault? If I hadn't helped you, you would have never left! - Left or right? - Helped me? Tubbe, do you remember that time... ...I helped you to steal the sultan's dentures... ...out of his mouth? Yeah. He was sound asleep, snoring. And he had no idea that it was us. He gave us a reward when we returned them to him! You and me, we're a really smart bunch of guys! Stealing dentures for adventures! You are both cheats. Were you planning to trick us with the diamond too? Kid, you better believe... We'd never do that. No. We're honorable pickpockets. We only steal from all the rich folks. Yeah, and give to the poor. I think I've even heard about us. Whoa! Get a move on, you old fleabag! At this rate, it'll take a least a week to get to the market. I'm already sick of listening to you two nincompoops! Giddy up! What is it now, you stubborn beast? Let's keep those hooves of yours moving! Hey! Well, well! What have we got here? A hard-working goat farmer in need of assistance. Oh, sure do. Things aren't going so good today. Let me give you a hand. I happen to know quite a bit about goats. For example, you wanna get your goat to market? You gotta pull it in the opposite direction. They're stubborn like mules, these goats. Whoa, boy, there you go. Amazing! Well, how can I thank you, sir? Will you please accept a humble coin? Such goodwill is rare nowadays. Oh... oh... I've lost my wallet. All my money. I must have dropped it somewhere. What am I gonna do? What am I gonna tell 'em at home? Oh, I'm ruined! Oh, don't be silly. Don't mention it. You can give me something when you sell your goat. It just so happens I'm on my way to the market myself. It's gotta be around here someplace. Hey, throw these little earnings in the chest. You took his wallet. I didn't take it. I found it. - No, you did not! - Yes, I found it. In his pocket. Yeah, right! The great Rapollo steals from the rich and gives to the poor! He's just a crook and he's gonna try and trick us too. He's just a swindler. That's what swindlers do. You're too suspicious. Let's get to the market. It's just amazing! Look over there! Wow! Hey, look at that guy. That guy needs someone to tie his shoelaces for him! Oh, finally, we're here. We'll camp here tonight and I will take care of the donkey. A bucket of hay in front! A bucket of water from the spout! That's an empty bucket behind, but what comes out? - OK, no more nonsense. - Right. Let's all go see the market. No, no, no, no, no! We all have to go to bed! We've got a very busy day tomorrow! Looks like you're already wearing your pajamas! Hey! Oh, you'd like that, wouldn't you? You can sleep under there with the rest of 'em! Get out! Seriously? - Good night, Egon. - Night-night. Hey, wake up, Egon! We have to go see the market. No, no. You need to see the plan. This here is the diamond. This here is us. And this is the watchdog. That's not a dog! A dog doesn't have a trunk! What? It's the police! They're coming this way! Then we're outta here! Here, hold that! I don't feel like talking to the police, right now. Ah, you're not so brave now... Cheeky brat! You don't wanna see my bad side! How about hiding in this chest instead? I think you can just about fit. I guess I'm gonna have to. And don't forget to let me out again. If you forget... - Yeah! - It's no more Mr. Nice Guy. You have to be quiet. The police are coming. - Hello, sir. - Hi. It's the police. Say, you're not doing anything illegal in here, are you? Say, where are you boys from? - From home. Don't be cheeky! Are you alone in that wagon? No. I don't see anyone else. Who else is in here? - The parrot! - No more Mr. Nice Guy! What's in the chest? Oh, it's full of fat men. - Very funny. - But you did ask. You are just two insolent vagabonds! Come on. We got more important things to do. We are on the lookout for dangerous criminals! So you have been informed! - They gone? - Yes. Then let me out! No, you'll have to wait. We're gonna look at the market first. Come on, Albert! Wait! Come back here, you little squirts! When I get hold of you, I'm gonna... Why did you lock the chest? Because Rapollo wouldn't let us see the market. Maybe some "me" time will do him some good. 200 Dollars? You can't mean that! It's worth at least 500 Dollars! It's my best and fattest goat. Hang on! There's the goat farmer Rapollo took the money from. Come on, Egon. That animal is so emaciated... ...you should have carried it here in your arms! 200 Dollars is all you're getting. 200 Dollars? You'll ruin me! Me and the wife, we have given this goat everything. It's been feeding on beets, potatoes and cabbage. Eew! 200 Dollars and not a cent more! If that skinny animal has had anything to eat... ...it can only have been a diet of dried prunes. It's rotten inside! That poor goat farmer's getting tricked again. 300 Dollars then? Shh! OK, then. That's a deal. I'm a generous man. I suppose it's not a bad goat, really. Actually, it's a nice animal for that price. 300 Dollars for pure-bred goat as fat as a hippopotamus? Yeah, what a swindler! We gotta do something. Got it! Hi, there! I would like to buy that goat! Ha! Excuse me, sir... ...are you selling this goat or are you not selling this goat? Get out of here, boy! Just get lost now. You hear me? - What's your best price? Give me that. I don't deal with kids. I thought you were a big businessman. You can't handle a little boy? OK, then. Why don't we say 600 Dollars? You won't have any money. Kids never do, I'm telling you. 600 Dollars? For a goat so small and skinny? I'd have to roll it home in a wheelbarrow. I'll give you 200 Dollars. Sorry. Excuse me. Oh, well, let's pretend you have some money. You can have it for 500 Dollars. Eugh! It's leaking! 200 Dollars. Not a cent more. That boy was not born yesterday! He deserves to get the goat! Yes, indeed! You can have it for 200 Dollars but I want my money now. In cash. Of course! Here it is! Here you go. Hang on. I was only joking. Yeah. Now, get lost and leave me to my business. No, wait. Give the kid the goat. A trade is a trade. Yes! Hand over the animal to the boy! We don't want any cheating. Sure I will! I am an honest businessman! Pesky kid! There you go. Here's your goat and your cash. But I did use 200 Dollars. Well, then I'm up 100 Dollars and I got my goat back! Oh, how can I thank you? You saved my life! My wife would have been furious... ...if I'd have come home with so little money. Oh, thank you so much! Albert, we need to look around the market. But the farmer got his goat back and made a profit. Yeah, yeah. You did good, Albert, but come on. So, you thought you could get one over on the great Rapollo? Did you now? Oh! And Tubbe and Gnalle too, eh? We just wanted to see the market. Yeah, but that's done now. How about stealing that diamond? Yeah. Let's get going. That diamond won't steal itself. Oh, you guys are some clever kids, huh? And now let's go and get our hands on that... I mean, my diamond. Get 'em while they're hot! Come on, folks! Well, it's almost coffee time. Wow! Look at that! I've always wanted to go see that. Oh, can we go see that now? Not now. You'll have to wait. Shh! Come on. Ladies and gentlemen, roll on up! Don't be shy! Yes, the rumors are true! Right here, in this very tent... ...you can see the world's biggest and most expensive diamond! You will not believe your eyes! Now listen up... What are you... You go and cause a distraction. I'll deal with the dog. And you guys... Just wait till I give the signal, OK, guys? You get it? Wait till I give the signal. That's right, folks. Understood? Come on. Step on up and witness... ...the most amazing, the most fantastic spectacle... ...of the whole universe! Amaze your friends! Tell them that you were the first to witness this natural spectacle. - Can you hear any signal? - No. I want my money back! That diamond is just a fake! It's a swindle! We're not paying to see a piece of colored glass! I also want my money back! Right now! There, there, my good people. Calm down. The diamond is genuine. I assure you. And no one's being hoodwinked. My good man, I can assure you... ...it is a misunderstanding. Wait! There's the signal! Come on! Where the heck in the wide world have you been? We're in the middle of a diamond heist. I can't keep this dog off me much longer! Hurry! Get under the tent! Whoa! Let's sort this out. Wow! - Police! Let's go! - Excuse me, ma'am. There ain't no diamond in the world can compete, I assure you. - What is going on here? - He's a cheat! - How so, ma'am? - Nobody here... Wow! I have put everything I own into this. We better take a look. Officer, I'm very sorry... - That dog is under arrest. - You can't just arrest a dog! You're not allowed to bite a police office in the b..t! Let's see the diamond. Oh, yeah. - ...where you can witness... - Quickly! The most amazing diamond for free. No! The diamond! My whole life's work ruined! So, there is no diamond, you cheat. And people paid a lot of money for that. It's fraud! You are under arrest! - The diamond was stolen. - Stolen, you say? But that's theft! Theft! Call the police! I think I saw the culprits. It was two boys. Any distinguishing characteristics? Yes. They look cheeky. Then we know who that is! Whomever can catch these hooligans... ...I'm gonna give them a generous award! We will take care of this! Leave it in the hands of the police! - We made it! - Yes, but what if somebody saw us? You're always so cautious! You can't even see the police without getting into a state! Talking about the police... After them! - What did I just say? - Split up! Quick! I'll take stripy shirt, you take his cheeky friend. I'm going this way, you're going that! Got it! Holy molies! Hello. Hi. What's up? Good day. What do you say here? How about "hi"? - Hi. - I'm Jumilla. This is my grandmother, Tahira. - What's up, dude? She wants to be a true American. That's why she talks that way. What's your name? - Egon. Jumilla means "beautiful." Just so you know. Yes, that's plain to see. - What does "Egon" mean? - I think it just means "Egon." Or... ..."a good one" and I'm a pirate. You're funny! If you're a pirate, then I'm a teacher. And my grandma is a supermodel. - World-class supermodel! Well, actually she's a psychic. A psychic? Then I have something I'd like to ask her. Something about my friend Albert and I. My grandma needs something personal from both of you. Nice pair of pants you have there. These are my pajama pants. Holy cow, Egon! This is totally awesome! But I don't have anything from Albert. Oh, no way, man! So not cool. Hang on. Way to go, Egon. Now good. Give me a glimpse of what it sees. Crystal ball, let me see. Show me what the future will be. Ah, I don't believe it. Mom, Dad... You don't have to be sad. The ball shows everything randomly. Your mom and dad are probably not sad anymore. Grandma, show us what will happen right now. You have to live in the present, even if you can see the future. That's what my grandma always says. Give me a glimpse of what it sees and make it snappy... ...or you'll end up a disco ball. Are you certain? But did he get the diamond? Yeah, yeah. Definitely. I saw that kid take off with the diamond. My diamond! The little fools! Think I wanna do a deal with them? I knew it! They're all crooks! Now, let's catch a little chicken brain. I cannot wait for my precious diamond. Rapollo has always been bad news. Such a b..d! Is that the boy who was buying the goat? That's Albert. He's on his way to Rapollo with the diamond. Hurry! We gotta stop him! And give that Rapollo a good kick in the b..t from me, OK? Here you go and now you can give us our reward. No! Stop! Reward? Oh, bless. The reward is we're gonna be best friends again. Got it? Reward! I told you, Albert. He's just a crook. Run! Get after them, you nitwits! Got you! You nitwits! You nitwits! You nitwits! We've fixed 'em real good. We're a couple of smart guys, alright. Funny those boys thought we'd share with them. To think they thought that it was my diamond! Well, it is now! They've nothing between their ears. They might be even dumber than you, Tubbe. Yeah, that's saying a lot! Oh, the poor diamond owner. Now, he has neither hair, nor a diamond! Now, let's go and celebrate. He ain't going anywhere. It's all my fault. I should have listened to Egon. I told them that Rapollo was a crook! But Albert never listens! But I think he's sorta cool. You don't know what he's like. He gave the money back to the farmer. That was good of him. Yeah. But he will always only do what he wants to do. An egotist. What does he wanna do? He wants to be a hot-air balloon captain. - That's a very good idea... - But he'll never be one now. Not while those crooks have him. We have to rescue him. I don't know. Come on! He's your best friend. Yeah. But how can we? We really showed that little carrot top who's boss. Yeah, his playing-smart days are definitely over. Yeah, all done. - What have they done to Albert? - We have to find out. Come on. Albert? Albert, where are you? - In here. Inside the sack. Egon, I'm so happy to see you! Sorry. Hey, no problem. I told you that Rapollo was a crook. Never mind that. Let's get out of here. Rapollo will be back any second now. You are an egotist! Did your mom or dad never teach you to listen? You may be of the opinion that I don't listen, Egon... ...but you can leave my mom and dad out of this! Gee, that Rapollo should have boxed your ears anyway! You don't use them for anything. That is not true! I use them to wiggle. Watch. That's not a bad skill for a hot-air balloon captain. Come on, guys. Can't you just be buddies? You're impossible, Albert. Hey, hang on a second. Albert, let's get a move on. Yeah, yeah, I'm coming. Come on! Keep up! Are you, like, a normal girl? No, I'm a fairground girl. Do you want me to show you around? I know all the good places. We'd love that, but I would like to have a little chat with Egon first. I'm sorry that I didn't listen. Don't be silly. It's nothing. That's how real scoundrels are! - And sorry I'm so Egon-tistic. But you're still my best friend. Come on, girls. Let's get moving! - Here you go. - Thank you. Come inside, little ladies and gents. Watch the lady from Hamburg sawn in half! Only 1 Dollar! A world sensation! Imagine seeing a lady cut in two pieces! Children aren't allowed to look. It's way too scary. Isn't there a back way? Of course. Sneak behind a tent... ...and crawl under. - Awesome! I'll stay here and eat gingerbread with Jumilla. I'm not a big fan of real blood. OK, I'll be back in a second. It's all happening here today, the greatest show on Earth! Roll up, roll up, ladies and gentlemen. Prepare to be amazed! Please welcome on stage the lovely lady from Hamburg! Shoot! I can't see anything. And now, ladies and gentlemen... ...the lady will crawl into this empty box! This lovely lady will place her lovely legs outside the box... ...for all to see! Mind your head! And now you'll see me with this saw. And I will saw this lady in half! Oh, my goodness. Crooks! We've been cheated! Yeah! We want our money back. What a scam! She wasn't even sawn in two! But people are being tricked. Wow. A real hot-air balloon! Yeah, and the captain is my grandpa. He can see everything from up there. It's disappeared. We can ask my grandma to look in her crystal ball... ...and see where it's heading. Come on! Yeah! We really are a couple of smart guys. And we caught that pesky boy. And got a hold of the diamond. Now, we just need our reward. Oh! That boy stinks of fish even more than he did before! Why me? What has the great Rapollo done to deserve this? So what about our reward? Reward? You brainless fool! Flying fish at starboard! Find that boy before he blabs to the police! Then we can talk about a reward! But if he blabs to the police... ...we'll go straight back to prison again. We definitely don't want that to happen. So, go get 'em then! What are you waiting for? Eeny, meeny, Halloweeny. Wow! The picture is disappearing. Concentrate! This is so random! It's not working! This cheap junk! Oh, no. I completely forgot. Rapollo has the diamond. And it's all my fault. The situation has escalated. I gotta get hold of that diamond... ...and give it to its rightful owner right now. We get that diamond. True scoundrel buddies always help each other out. - Yeah, definitely. - Thanks for your help, Tahira. And don't forget to give Rapollo a knuckle sandwich! The coast is clear. Come on. You hold the parrot, Egon. I'll take the key. You make sure Rapollo doesn't wake up, Jumilla. Help! Daylight robbery! - Yeah. - Give it me! Holy smoke! Rapollo will be furious! He'll be even more furious... ...when he discovers that this is gone. Awesome! Let's get out of here. My diamond! Darn. We were doing so well. Well, what have we here? Two small insolent little vagabonds! - No, we're not! - Oh, you're not? Then you couldn't have stolen a diamond. No idea what you're talking about. Then you wouldn't mind if we look in your pockets, kid. Certainly not, sir. Wait. I can't check your pockets if your hands are in 'em. Oh, right. I'll check the other little thief! - That tickles! - Whoops! Well, lookie here. Yeah! Whoops, right? This is not your diamond, is it? You little crooks! It's not what you think. Albert and Egon are innocent. They were on their way to the bald man to give him his diamond. Yeah, sure. Everyone knows that criminals... ...return to the scene of the crime. We're onto you, little girl. Your grandmother's the psychic. She pretends to tell people the truth. Your grandmother's full of lies! I'm sure you are too. Beat it or I'll arrest you as well! - You go on home, Jumilla. - OK. But I will be back. I just got an idea. Now, you're coming with us. Oh, someone please take pity on this poor man! My diamond! My life's work! Now, move it, you little punks. Sir, these two little boys have something to say to you. OK, then. What do you want? It's nothing. You wouldn't believe us anyhow. Adults always stick together. Then the police must step in again! As usual! - Yeah! We have caught the diamond thieves. They don't look like much, but they're dangerous. When we caught them, they lied and tried to escape! That's not true. We wanted to return the diamond. Honest. That's right. We didn't do anything wrong. We did help to steal it, but we thought... It's not for you to think. It's for us to know. Do you confess? - But that's not what I said. - Here is the evidence. We found it on them. My diamond! My dia-mond! Don't say that we only catch those without lights on their bikes! What are we gonna do, Albert? I don't know. I really miss my mom and dad. I'll never see them again. I just wish we were back home in Kelly Town. Yeah, but nobody likes me there anyway. That's not true. Your mom and dad do. Well, that doesn't count. It's the parents' job to like their kids. And Jumilla. She's gone too. But she said that she'd be back. Yeah, we can only hope. Oh, no. I thought it was only a dream. Hey, Albert, wait till you hear what I dreamt about. Darn! It wasn't a dream. So, are you ready for your punishment? But we told you! It wasn't our fault! We were tricked by some real robbers! Yeah, Tubbe, Gnalle and Rapollo! What would it take for you to believe us? I don't know. Maybe if an angel floats down and confirms your explanation. And that's not very likely now, is it? Oh, my! It is an angel. - Jumilla! - Hi, guys! Didn't I say I'd come back? Say hi to my grandpa. You're the hot-air balloonist from Kelly Town? Why, yes, actually. How did you know? I recognized you from the statue. Well, I will be darned! They put up a statue of me in Kelly Town? Not anymore. Well, that doesn't matter. I've come here to help two innocent boys. Everything they say is true! I see things from my hot-air balloon. Things that other people cannot see. What kind of things would those be? Well, yeah, and I can guarantee you that the real crooks... ...are Rapollo, Gnalle and Tubbe. Albert thought the diamond belonged to Rapollo. He's really sorry about it. He wanted to give the diamond back to the rightful owner. I just wanted to make some money so I could buy a hot-air balloon... ...and fly home to Kelly Town as a hot-air balloon captain. That is my biggest wish. You don't say? But first we should teach that Rapollo... ...and the other two crooks a lesson. Yeah! And I know exactly how to do that. What? Now, keep your eyes peeled for those kids. I've got to get to them before they get any bright ideas. Gotcha, you two little numbskulls! You thought you could get away with it! You got another thing coming! Thought you could get away! Hand over my diamond. Here you go then. Nobody gets away with taking the great Rapollo's stolen goods! Ah, I've been planning this little heist... ...for way too long. I'm the one tricking you, not the other way around. Yeah. It's us tricking you, not the other way around. There's no doubt about it. We're real sly tricksters us three, eh? Funny how you fell for all my tall tales. How dumb can you be? But now the diamond is finally mine. And nobody can take it from me. I think we'll be the judge of that. In the name of the law, I hereby arrest you. I think these... Do you really think so? You there, you're really gonna get it! Yeah! The time has come for you kids or my name is not Rapollo. Gnalle, Tubbe, get this mutt off of me! Coming! Good boy! Oh, no! No! Wait! You got the wrong guy! Long live Leopoldus. Long live the police. And long live the clever little kids! Put me down! I'm getting seasick! I'm getting seasick! Oh, please, let us down. Don't worry. It's a special place for you guys. You two nitwits! You're gonna regret this! Nitwits! Nitwits! You're gonna regret this! There's something I want to ask you, Albert. Would you been interested in an almost-new hot-air balloon? Sure would! You see, I have dreamt about becoming more grounded... ...so I can spend more time with my girls. And I'll teach you how to fly. Do you really mean it? You'll make the perfect... ...new hot-air balloon captain of Kelly Town. Yippee! I can't believe that someone would give a hot-air balloon away. I definitely didn't count on that. No. It's not something that happens every day... ...and it comes with a pirate's spyglass. Egon, would you like to be the pirate captain of my ship? Yeah, I'd like that very much. - Then we have a deal. - Thank you so much! Albert, I think that a hot-air balloon... ...is perfect for a modern pirate. We could use a fairground princess. Wanna come with us, Jumilla? Why, thank you. I'm flattered to be asked by boys who normally hate girls. We don't hate fairground girls, right, Egon? But I really have to stay here... ...and help my grandma and my grandpa. But that's alright. Now that you have a hot-air balloon... ...you can just come visit me. You're right! Fly high, fellas! Remember to go over the mountain tops! Watch out for the pointy bits! Don't forget to visit me! You can count on that! You know what? Jumilla would make a great balloon pirate. Yeah. Maybe not all girls are annoying. What do you think? It will be so nice to get back to Kelly Town. Yeah, I'd love some of my mom's pancakes. Wouldn't you? - Yeah, with some pears. Someone's a bit nosy, right, Grandma? I see into the future, darn it. It is my job, girlfriend. Hey, look! Albert's mom and dad and Egon's parents. They're all happy again. Look! Everybody gets to go in the hot-air balloon. Look at those high flyers. My goodness! Look at that big bully! He looks like he's gonna hit Albert. Oh, no, no. He is just kidding. There they go! Off on an adventure! It's hungry work!
