YESSIREE, MR. LOREN, WHEN THE STAGE ROLLS IN I'M GONNA BE ONE OF THE BIGGEST LANDHOLDERS IN THIS PART OF THE COUNTRY. MY PARTNERS COMIN' IN TO HELP ME RUN CATTLE, TOO. WE'RE GONNA SHOW THIS TOWN WHAT A BIG RANCH LOOKS LIKE. I HOPE YOU'RE LUCKIER THAN I AM, FUZZY. DON'T WORRY, I'LL LEND YOU A HERD TILL YOU'RE ON YOUR FEET. HOW'S YOUR WIFE, MR. MURRAY? SHE'S AILIN' PRETTY BAD, FUZZY, AND THE DOC CAN'T GET HERE FOR A WEEK. BUT HE'S SENDIN' SOME MEDICINE IN ON THE STAGE. WELL, THAT'LL HELP HER. SAY, I HEARD YOU STRUCK IT RICH UP ON LAW'S CREEK. I WISH I COULD FIND ME A GOLD MINE. I HOPE IT'S A RICH STRIKE -- I'M EXPECTING THE ASSAYER'S REPORT ON THIS MAIL. IF IT'S WHAT I THINK IT IS, EVERYTHING WILL BE ALL RIGHT WITH ME. I GOT AN IMPORTANT LETTER COMIN' IN, TOO -- IT'S ABOUT MY LAND DEAL. TOO BAD WE ONLY GET MAIL JUST TWICE A MONTH. SEEMS LIKE EVERYBODY IN TOWN'S DEPENDING ON THIS MAIL. HERE SHE COMES, NOW! WHERE DID IT HAPPEN THIS TIME? IN THAT WOODED SPOT ON THE UPPER FLATS ROAD. JOE THREW DOWN THE STRONG BOX JUST BEFORE THEY GOT HIM. THEN YOU GOT THE MAIL THROUGH? NOPE, THEY DIDN'T STOP FOR THE BOX. THE THREE OF'EM MADE ME THROW DOWN THE BAG. WHY, THEM DIRTY LOWDOWN POLECATS -- I'D LIKE TO GET MY HANDS ON 'EM! ED, TAKE CARE OF JOE. HIT YOU HARD, TOO, LOREN? YES. I HAD HOPES OF GETTIN' WORD FROM MY BROTHER. THIS THING WILL ABOUT FINISH ME. SOMETHING WRONG, FUZZY? SURE IS, MR. WRIGHT. THE STAGE WAS HELD UP AGAIN AND THEM BANDITS KILLED JOE HAWKINS. DID THE DRIVER SAVE THE MAIL? NO, THOSE COYOTES GOT EVERYTHING. SOMETHING'S GOTTA BE DONE TO STOP THESE HOLDUPS. IT'S HURTING TOO MANY PEOPLE. I'LL SAY IT IS, AND I'M ONE OF 'EM! TALK TO ME, FUZZ -- YOU JUST DON'T LOOK RIGHT! I'M ALL RIGHT. YOU'RE ALL RIGHT? I GUESS IT MUST BE THE NEW PANTS. AREN'T YOU GLAD TO SEE ME? I AM, I AM -- WHAT ABOUT THAT RANCH OF YOURS? COME ON, YOU CAN SHOW ME THE SPREAD. BILLY, I AIN'T GOT NO LAND NOW. THINGS HAVE BEEN HAPPENING AROUND HERE. WHAT DO YOU MEAN? I EXPECTED MY PAPERS ON THAT STAGE, AND IT GOT ROBBED. WHERE'S THE SHERIFF? SEEMS LIKE ANYTIME THESE THINGS HAPPEN, HE'S OUT OF TOWN. ANYWAY, HE COULDN'T CATCH A FLY IN A BUCKET. IF HE HAD BEEN ON THE JOB, THIS WOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED TO MY LAND DEAL. THEY WENT RIGHT PAST THE STRONG BOX AND GRABBED THE MAIL. GRABBED THE MAIL? DOESN'T SEEM LIKE ANY ORDINARY HOLDUP. USUALLY THEY GRAB THE GOLD AND LEAVE THE MAIL ALONE. NOT THE BREED WE GOT AROUND HERE. EVERYBODY IN TOWN WAS WAITING FOR THAT MAIL! I'D LIKE TO GET MY HANDS ON -- NO USE STANDIN' THERE YELLIN' ABOUT IT -- WHERE'D IT HAPPEN? ON THE UPPER FLATS ROAD. COME ON, MAYBE WE CAN PICK UP THEIR TRAIL. WHO'S THAT STRANGER WITH FUZZY? I DON'T KNOW. MUST BE THE PARTNER HE WAS WAITING FOR. THIS LOOKS LIKE THE SPOT WHERE IT HAPPENED. YEAH. LOOKS LIKE THEY TURNED OFF THIS WAY. WHAT'S OVER IN THAT DIRECTION? NOTHING BUT AN OLD MINING CAMP. WE'LL HAVE A LOOK. THAT'S FUNNY -- THAT CABIN'S BEEN DESERTED FOR YEARS. NOT NOW. ( gunshots ) HEY, WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO? FLUSH 'EM OUT. SUITS ME. WE'VE GOTTA MAKE A BREAK FOR IT! BURN THAT STUFF! ALL RIGHT... LET'S GET AFTER 'EM! WAIT A MINUTE -- LET 'EM GO. I WANT TO SEE WHAT'S IN THAT CABIN. HA! WE OUTSMARTED 'EM THIS TIME! YOU MEAN THIS MAIL SACK DID. BILLY, SEE IF YOU CAN FIND MY LETTER. SUPPOSE YOU WERE A BANDIT -- WHAT WOULD YOU GO AFTER? GOLD, SILVER, JEWELS. THAT'S WHAT MAKES THIS HOLDUP SO DIFFERENT. SOMEBODY WANTED THESE LETTERS BAD ENOUGH TO KILL A GUARD. IT WEREN'T THE VALUABLES THEY WERE AFTER, IT WAS INFORMATION. THIS IS JUST WHAT I MEAN. THIS MAN WAS PRETTY HARD HIT -- "DEAR MR. WRIGHT, "I HOPE THIS REACHES YOU IN TIME "TO GET YOU OUT OF YOUR TROUBLE." I SAW HIM THIS MORNING AND HE LOOKED AWFUL WORRIED. I'M SORRY YOU DIDN'T RECEIVE WORD FROM THE BANK, GEORGE. I'D BE GLAD TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE MORE TIME. THANKS, BUT THAT WOULD ONLY ADD TO THE BURDEN. I'D LIKE YOU TO TAKE OVER NOW -- IT'LL EASE MY MIND. IT SEEMS A SHAME TO LOSE THE HOTEL, DAD. MR. HAYDEN'S WILLING TO WAIT. WHAT'S THE USE? I WANT TO SETTLE THE MATTER RIGHT NOW. THEN I CAN START OVER. ALL RIGHT, IF YOU INSIST. WHAT ARE WE STOPPING HERE FOR? LET'S GO BACK AND TRY TO GET THE DROP ON 'EM. WE CAN'T AFFORD TO LET 'EM FIND THAT EVIDENCE. LET'S GO. DOES IT SAY ANYTHING ABOUT A CHECK IN THERE? YEAH. "ENCLOSED IS THE WELLS FARGO CHECK. "THIS LOAN IS COVERED "BY THE NOTE YOU FORWARDED TO OUR BANK." AIN'T NOTHIN' IN IT. OF COURSE NOT -- WHAT DID YOU EXPECT? WHOEVER'S GOT THE CHECK CAN'T CASH IT -- BUT THEY COULD KEEP IT AND CLOSE DOWN ON WRIGHT, COULDN'T THEY? YOU'VE FIGURED IT OUT -- EXCEPT SOMEBODY IN TOWN BEAT YOU TO IT. ANY IDEA WHO IT COULD BE? IT'S AS PLAIN AS THE NOSE ON YOUR FACE -- THOSE STAGECOACH ROBBERS. I DON'T THINK SO. YOU DON'T? NOPE. THEN WHO IS IT? THAT'S WHAT I'M GONNA HAVE TO FIND OUT. THAT'S WHERE YOU NEED ME -- I'M A FERRET WHEN IT COMES TO FINDING OUT THINGS. "I'LL NEVER FORGET THE SWEETNESS OF YOUR KISSES, "AND THE LOVE IN YOUR EYES "THE NIGHT WE WERE TOGETHER UNDER THE STARS. "I WAS SO CHOKED UP, "I DIDN'T SAY WHAT I WANTED TO ALL THE WEEKS WE WERE TOGETHER. "WILL YOU MARRY ME? "I'LL MEET EVERY STAGE WAITING FOR YOUR ANSWER. "PLEASE, JANE, SAY YES. "I HOPE I HAVEN'T BEEN TOO BOLD..." TSK TSK, FUZZ -- SHAME ON YOU. I-I DIDN'T MEAN TO READ THIS, IT'S JANE RICE... I GOTTA GET IT TO HER SOME WAY. I CAN'T HAVE HER BELIEVIN' SHE'S BEEN JILTED. WAIT A MINUTE, WE CAN'T TIP OUR HAND UNTIL WE WORK THIS THING OUT. DO YOU KNOW A MAN BY THE NAME OF LOREN? YEAH, YEAH... HAS HE BEEN JILTED, TOO? NO, OF COURSE NOT, HE'S GOT FOUR CHILDREN. HE'S BEEN PRETTY HARD HIT. "DEAR BROTHER PAUL, "HANNAH AND ME ARE SORRY ABOUT THE LOSS OF YOUR CATTLE. "WE SCRAPED TOGETHER $200 AND ENCLOSE IT. "HOPING ALL WILL BE ALL RIGHT. YOUR BROTHER, HARRY." DON'T TELL THE CHILDREN, PAUL. LET THEM THINK THE MONEY IS COMING ON THE NEXT STAGE. BUT THAT AIN'T FOR TWO WEEKS. MEANTIME, HOW ARE WE GONNA EAT? WE'LL MANAGE SOMEHOW -- YOU'LL SEE. I JUST AIN'T GOT WORDS TO EXPRESS MY OPINION OF A SIDEWINDER WHO WOULD STEAL $200 OUT OF A MAN'S LETTER. THANKS, FUZZ. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? I'M GONNA MAKE IT LOOK LIKE ALL THEM LETTERS ARE BURNED UP, JUST IN CASE THOSE OUTLAWS COME SNOOPIN' AROUND. NOW YOU'RE USING YOUR HEAD FOR SOMETHING ELSE BESIDES GROWING WHISKERS. CAN WE GET TO YOUR CABIN WITHOUT BEING SEEN? SURE CAN. GOOD. WE GOTTA FIND A PLACE TO HIDE THESE LETTERS. I GOT JUST THE SPOT. LEND ME YOUR KNIFE. HURRY UP. OKAY. THERE AIN'T NOTHIN' WRONG HERE. LET'S GET OUT OF HERE. ONLY ONE THING WRONG -- THE BOSS AIN'T GONNA LIKE YOU KILLING THAT GUARD. DON'T TRY TO PIN THAT KILLING ONTO ME! I SEEN YOU PICK HIM OFF. HOLD IT, YOU TWO! WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER. WHAT'S HE TRYING TO HANG THAT KILLING ON ME FOR? THERE AIN'T GONNA BE NO ACCUSIN' ONE ANOTHER, OR SOMEBODY'S GETTIN' THEIR TRAP SHUT WITH LEAD. COME ON, THROW WHAT YOU GOT ON THE TABLE. THE BOSS WILL WANT THIS. WASN'T MUCH IN THAT FARGO BOX THIS TIME. YEAH, BUT THIS HAUL'S GIVIN' US SOME NICE DEALS THE BOSS'LL BE ABLE TO GRAB. WHAT'S THE IDEA OF STOPPING HERE? YOU SEE THIS PLACE? YEAH, IT'S BIG ENOUGH. THIS IS WHERE WE'LL MEET IF WE EVER GET SEPARATED. YOU KIDDIN'? FROM NOW ON, I'M GONNA STICK SO CLOSE TO YOU THEY'LL THINK WE'RE TWINS. DON'T WISH THAT ON ME. LET'S DROP BY YOUR CABIN AND HIDE THIS STUFF. WE'LL GO BY MURRAY'S AFTERWARDS. COME ON. HERE'S MURRAY'S LETTER -- WE'LL DROP IT IN THE MAILBOX ON THE WAY INTO TOWN. HEY, BILLY -- COME HERE! I WONDER HOW COME MURRAY GETS A LETTER WHEN EVERYBODY KNOWS ALL THE MAIL'S BEEN STOLEN. THE COUNTY ASSAYER'S OFFICE IN MAINVILLE. THIS LETTER'S BEEN OPENED AND RESEALED -- LOOK AT THAT. I'LL BETCHA THOSE OUTLAWS DELIVERED IT. I WONDER WHY? IF THERE WAS ANY VALUE, THEY WOULD HAVE KEPT IT. YOU HIT THE NAIL RIGHT ON THE HEAD -- IF IT'S VALUABLE, THEY KEEP IT -- NO VALUE, THEY DELIVER IT. MAYBE MURRAY CAN CLEAR IT UP -- COME ON. HELLO, FUZZY. I WANT YOU TO MEET BILLY CARSON. GLAD TO KNOW YOU. HOWDY. SIT DOWN. TOO BAD ABOUT THAT STAGE HOLDUP. YES, I WAS EXPECTING SOMETHING FROM DR. NORTON. I WAS ALSO HOPING TO GET SOME GOOD NEWS FROM THE ASSAYER. WELL, MAYBE THIS IS IT. IT WAS IN THE MAILBOX. HOW DID IT GET THERE? WHOEVER HELD UP THE STAGE MUST HAVE DELIVERED IT. WHAT'S THE MATTER? IS IT BAD NEWS? YES. I THOUGHT I STRUCK IT RICH, AND I SENT SOME SAMPLES IN TO BE ASSAYED. BUT IT'S NOTHING BUT LOW-GRADE ORE. KEEP DIGGING -- MAYBE YOU LOST THE VEIN. IT'S NO USE. I'LL SEE IF MR. HAYDEN WILL TAKE THE CLAIM OFF MY HANDS FOR THE LAND VALUE. IT'LL GIVE ME ANOTHER GRUBSTAKE. I WOULDN'T BE IN A HURRY, MR. MURRAY. MIND IF I HAVE A LOOK AT THAT? GO AHEAD. I'VE NEVER SEEN AN ASSAYER'S REPORT WRITTEN -- THEY ALWAYS COME IN A PRINTED FORM. THAT'S RIGHT, JIM. IF YOU CAN HOLD ON... I'D SAY HOLD. FUZZ, LET HIM HAVE THE MEDICINE. OH YEAH, I FORGOT. WHERE'D YOU GET THAT? YOU CAN BANK ON IT WE DIDN'T HOLD ANY STAGECOACH UP TO GET IT. I'M MIGHTY GRATEFUL -- MY WIFE WAS DEPENDING ON THIS. YOU CAN BE A LOT OF HELP, MR. MURRAY, BY KEEPING THIS QUIET. YEAH, WE'RE GOING INTO TOWN TO FIND OUT WHAT WE CAN. WE'RE BANKIN' ON YOU. YOU CAN DEPEND ON ME, BOYS. BYE BYE. GOODBYE. WHO ARE THE GENTS PLAYING POKER, FUZZ? I'LL BET A HUNDRED. I'LL CALL IT AND RAISE YOU A HUNDRED. GENTS IS RIGHT. THE ONE WITH THE KNIFE IS CAINE, THE OTHER TWO ARE GIBBS AND GORDON. NEVER WORKED A DAY IN THEIR LIFE, THE ORNERY HOUNDS. I'LL RAISE YOU ANOTHER HUNDRED. NEVER WORKED A DAY? THEY SEEM TO HAVE A LOT OF MONEY. HOW DO YOU ACCOUNT FOR THAT? YOU DON'T, AND YOU DON'T DARE ASK 'EM, EITHER. DON'T TANGLE WITH 'EM -- LEAVE 'EM STRICTLY ALONE. WHADDYA GOT? BEATS ME. ( loudly slurping ) WHAT'S THAT YOU'RE EATING, FUZZ? SOUNDS GOOD. PARCHED CORN. SURE MAKES THIS SOUP TASTE GOOD. DID YOU SAY PARCHED CORN? YEP. BETTER HAVE ANOTHER LOOK. HEY! HEY! WHAT HAVE I BEEN EATING?! MEXICAN JUMPING BEANS. NOW ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN, FUZZ. OH, TARNATION! DON'T DO THAT! DRINKING WATER'LL REALLY MAKE 'EM HOP! HERE THEY GO! HERE THEY GO! HEY! WHAT ARE YOU JUMPING ABOUT?! I-I-I -- MEXICAN JUMPING BEANS! IF YOU DON'T QUIT, I'LL GIVE YOU SOMETHING TO JUMP ABOUT!! COME OVER HERE, FUZZY! OH, BOY... I'M GLAD THAT'S OVER. I WOULDN'T BE SO SURE ABOUT THAT. YOU'RE GONNA BE JUMPIN' FROM NOW ON! THEY MULTIPLY -- ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU DRINK WATER. OH... WHERE YOU GOIN', MISS JANE? WHAT'S HAPPENED? WE'RE MOVING INTO A CABIN ON TWIN OAKS ROAD. WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOUR HOTEL? DON'T YOU LIKE THE SERVICE? MR. HAYDEN'S THE NEW OWNER. YOU MEAN YOU DON'T OWN THIS PLACE NO MORE? NO, FUZZY, I'M AFRAID NOT. LET ME HELP YOU, MISS JANE. NO THANK YOU, MR. CAINE. WHY YOU ALWAYS TURNING ME DOWN? TO BE PERFECTLY HONEST, I DON'T LIKE YOU. I WISH YOU WOULDN'T BOTHER ME ANYMORE. GIVE YOURSELF HALF A CHANCE -- I'M NOT BAD COMPANY AFTER YOU KNOW ME. SEEMS YOU DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THE LADY -- SHE ASKED YOU NOT TO BOTHER HER ANYMORE. Sheriff: HOLD IT! WHAT'S GOING ON? NO MORE ROUGH STUFF -- I'M RUNNING THIS PLACE NOW! MISS JANE, MEET MY PAL, BILLY CARSON. HOW DO YOU DO? AND JANE'S FATHER, GEORGE WRIGHT. WE'VE GOT A LOT IN COMMON, SIR. GLAD TO KNOW YOU. MR. HAYDEN, I WANT YOU TO MEET MY PARTNER, TOO. BILLY CARSON, FRANK HAYDEN. MR. HAYDEN'S THE MOST IMPORTANT CITIZEN IN TOWN. HE OWNS THE BANK. ALWAYS PAYS TO KNOW A BANKER. Sheriff: I'VE BEEN OUT TRAILING THOSE BANDITS. LOOK WHAT I FOUND IN THE OLD SHACK NEAR STONY CREEK. ALL THE LETTERS WERE BURNED. THEY OUGHTA BE SHOT FOR DESTROYING PEOPLE'S PROPERTY! THERE'S A MURDER CHARGE AGAINST 'EM NOW. WE'VE GOT TO PUT A STOP TO THIS. Sheriff: I'M DOING MY BEST. IT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE GOOD ENOUGH -- FOLKS ARE BEING RUINED! MR. HAYDEN, YOU COULD HELP BY NOT CLAMPING DOWN ON THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN ROBBED. WELL, I'D LIKE TO, BUT BUSINESS IS BUSINESS. GOOD LUCK, FRANK. I'LL NEED IT. I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT RUNNING HOTELS. IF YOU NEED ANY HELP, GEORGE, LET ME KNOW. SHERIFF, LET'S SEE IF WE CAN MAKE PLANS TO STOP ALL THIS. MR. WRIGHT, MIND IF I ASK YOU A FEW QUESTIONS? I GUESS NOT. WHAT CAUSED YOU TO SELL OUT? I COULDN'T CARRY ON ANYMORE. I DON'T BLAME FRANK -- IT WAS A JUST DEBT. I SUPPOSE YOU'RE RIGHT. YOU KNOW, HAYDEN'S GATHERED IN QUITE A BIT OF PROPERTY LATELY. HAS IT OCCURRED TO YOU THAT HE MIGHT BE MIXED UP IN THIS? IF YOU'RE THINKING ALONG THOSE LINES, YOU'RE WRONG -- FRANK'S MY FRIEND. IT WAS JUST AN IDEA. FUZZ, LET'S HELP YOUR FRIENDS OUT TO THEIR CABIN. IN THE MORNING, WE'LL DO A LITTLE SCOUTING AROUND. I'M KIND OF SUSPICIOUS OF THAT FRIEND OF FUZZY'S. YOU MAY HAVE SOMETHING -- HE DON'T LOOK RIGHT TO ME. ANY OF YOU MEN EVER SEEN HIM BEFORE? KEEP AN EYE ON HIM. THAT'S JUST WHAT I INTEND TO DO. I'LL CALL YOU MEN WHEN I NEED YOU. ( all snickering ) YOU DID A SWELL JOB, BOYS. THE HOTEL IS OURS, AND I'M PRETTY SURE WE'LL GET LOREN'S RANCH. AND MURRAY'S CLAIM OUT OF THIS HAUL. YEAH... YOU KNOW, I LIKE GETTING MY HANDS ON THAT GOLD MINE, BUT I DON'T LIKE YOUR KILLING THAT GUARD. WHEN IT COMES TO MURDER, I WANT NO PART OF IT. YEAH? WELL, WE'RE COUNTING YOU IN. I JUST TOLD THE BOYS, WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER, AND THAT GOES FOR YOU, TOO. PHILLIPS DIDN'T COME THROUGH LAST WEEK. MAYBE I'D BETTER PAY HIM A VISIT. DON'T GET ROUGH. FUZZ, YOU HANG OUT IN THE SALOON. I'LL KEEP MY EYE ON CAINE. YOU MISSED LAST WEEK'S PAYMENT. WHAT ABOUT IT? I CAN'T AFFORD TO GIVE YOU ANY MONEY NOW. I'M ABOUT TO GO OUT OF BUSINESS. MAYBE I OUGHT TO PAY A LITTLE VISIT TO THE SHERIFF. NO, NO -- NOT THAT. WAIT A FEW DAYS, I'LL GIVE YOU SOME MONEY. SEE THAT YOU DO. Hayden: WOULDN'T BE SMART TO BLEED HIM. I'M FOR GETTING ALL WE CAN. LET PHILLIPS GET SOME NEW STOCK IN HIS STORE, THEN WE'LL GET ALL THE MORE. NOW I KNOW WHO'S WHO AROUND HERE. YOU'RE A DIRTY BUNCH OF BLACKMAILERS! I DON'T CARE WHAT HAPPENS TO ME -- I'M GOIN' TO THE SHERIFF! I SAW IT ALL, BOYS -- IT WAS A PLAIN CASE OF SELF DEFENSE. WHADDYA MEAN, I WAS STANDING -- WHAT'D YOU SAY, MR. HAYDEN? I SAID IT WAS A PLAIN CASE OF SELF-DEFENSE. YEAH, A PLAIN CASE OF SELF-DEFENSE... FOR SOMEBODY. ALL RIGHT, BOYS, BREAK IT UP. GIBBS, GO CALL THE SHERIFF. WHAT HAPPENED, FUZZ? PHILLIPS CALLED HAYDEN A BLACKMAILER, AND CAINE SHOT HIM IN THE BACK. IN THE BACK?! WHERE DID PHILLIPS LIVE? HE USED TO LIVE IN THE BACK OF HIS STORE. KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN AND YOUR MOUTH SHUT. I'M GONNA HAVE A LOOK IN PHILLIPS' ROOM. GIVE US A COUPLE OF DRINKS. Hayden: GET OVER TO PHILLIPS' STORE AND SEE WHAT YOU CAN FIND. HEY, WHERE YOU GOIN'?! NOBODY LEAVES HERE TILL I SAY SO! I SAW IT ALL -- PLAIN CASE OF SELF-DEFENSE. MAYBE SO, BUT I DON'T LIKE WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON AROUND HERE. YOU'RE IN QUITE A HURRY TO GET OUT OF HERE. THEM JUMPIN' BEANS. WHAT?! WHERE'S THAT FRIEND OF YOURS, FUZZY? WHO? WELL, UH... HE WAS AROUND HERE A MINUTE AGO. MAYBE HE'S OUTSIDE -- I'LL GO GET HIM FOR YA! Sheriff: WE'LL HAVE TO HAVE A CORONER'S JURY, AND YOU MEN WILL HAVE TO TESTIFY. Hayden: THAT'S THE THING TO DO, SHERIFF. FIND ANYTHING? I'LL SAY I DID -- SOMEBODY WAS IN THERE. HE BAGGED ME WITH A CURTAIN SO I DIDN'T SEE HIM, BUT I'VE GOT A PRETTY GOOD IDEA WHO IT WAS. I JUST ABOUT HAD HIM WHEN FUZZY SMACKED INTO ME. ONLY MAN HE'D WANT TO HELP WOULD BE THAT STRANGER. DO YOU THINK HE'S A LAWMAN SENT HERE BY THE STAGE COMPANY? WELL, WHOEVER HE IS, WE'RE ONTO HIM. THE SHERIFF BELIEVES THAT PHILLIPS WENT FOR HIS GUN, BUT HE WANTS TO ASK YOU SOME QUESTIONS -- COME ON. GOOD THING YOU KEPT YOUR MOUTH CLOSED IN THE SALOON, FUZZ. HOW COULD I DO ANYTHING ELSE AFTER YOU KICKED ME IN THE SHINS? DID YOU FIND ANYTHING IN PHILLIPS' STORE? SURE DID -- THIS. I WANT TO HAVE A TALK WITH SOME OF YOUR FRIENDS. THAT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME. YOU SAY THAT PHILLIPS WAS SHOT IN THE BACK, YET THERE WAS FOUR MEN IN THAT ROOM THAT SAYS HE WAS SHOT IN SELF-DEFENSE. NO JURY WOULD BELIEVE YOU, FUZZY, WHEN ONE OF THE MEN IS AN UPRIGHT CITIZEN LIKE FRANK HAYDEN. PHILLIPS CALLED HIM A BLACKMAILER. HE MUST HAVE HAD A REASON. MAYBE YOU CAN TELL ME WHAT IT IS. MAYBE I CAN. I CAN'T BELIEVE IT! AL PHILLIPS AN ESCAPED CONVICT?! SO PHILLIPS WAS OUR MAN. LOOKS LIKE THESE ROBBERIES ARE STOPPED NOW. YOU'RE WRONG THERE, SHERIFF -- IT'S A SMARTER MAN THAN PHILLIPS. CAN'T YOU SEE WHY PHILLIPS ACCUSED HAYDEN? ARE YOU IMPLYING THAT FRANK HAYDEN HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH THESE ROBBERIES? THAT'S WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE TO ME. THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE! MR. HAYDEN HAS HELPED EVERYBODY IN TOWN. JUST LIKE HE'S HELPED YOUR FATHER AND A LOT OF OTHER HARD-PRESSED PEOPLE. BY TAKING EVERYTHING FROM 'EM -- HE SURE IS A KIND-HEARTED MAN. YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO GET THESE, AREN'T YOU, SHERIFF? CERTAINLY. HAVE YOU RECEIVED ANY SINCE THE HOLDUPS? NO. HAYDEN HAS. I WOULDN'T BE ACCUSING HIM OF THINGS YOU CAN'T PROVE. HE'S A GENEROUS MAN -- HE PAID FOR THE JAIL. HAS HE EVER BEEN IN IT? CERTAINLY NOT! I'M AFRAID YOU BOYS ARE WRONG. OF COURSE THEY ARE! YOU KNOW SO MUCH? MAYBE WE SHOULD BE INVESTIGATING YOU! I'M AFRAID YOU MADE A BAD MOVE, TIPPIN' YOUR HAND TO THE SHERIFF. NO, I DIDN'T. I STILL THINK HAYDEN WANTS TO TAKE OVER THIS TOWN. IF WHAT YOU SAY IS TRUE AND THE SHERIFF TIPS OFF HAYDEN, YOU'RE LIABLE TO BE DODGING HOT LEAD! SO LONG AS I KEEP DODGING. WE COULD LICK THE WHOLE BUNCH OF 'EM! YEAH, IF THEY DON'T SHOOT BILLY IN THE BACK. IF THEY DO, WE'LL KNOW THE SHERIFF'S IN WITH HAYDEN AND THE REST OF 'EM. HA! NO, I MEAN, WELL... THAT WOULDN'T BE A GOOD WAY TO GET EVIDENCE, WOULD IT? I THINK THE SHERIFF IS HONEST ENOUGH. HE WANTS MORE PROOF, AND THAT'S WHAT HE'LL GET. FUZZ, I WANT YOU TO THROW A SCARE INTO THOSE THREE FELLAS THAT HANG AROUND THE SALOON. AND BE SURE YOU WATCH WHERE THEY GO. YOU COMIN'? NOT THIS TIME. I AIN'T GONNA GO STICKING MY NECK OUT ALONE, NOT FOR YOU OR ANYBODY ELSE, NOT EVEN THE U.S.ARMY! I'M STAYIN' RIGHT HERE! I WILL NOT GO ALONE!! HOW DO YOU SUPPOSE THIS GOT HERE? THIS IS MURRAY'S LETTER! Caine: LOOK WHAT I FOUND NAILED TO THE DOOR OF THE SHACK. I THOUGHT THE MAIL WAS ALL BURNED. WE THOUGHT IT WAS. THE SHERIFF SAID -- I KNOW WHAT HE SAID. THIS WAS TO THROW A SCARE INTO YOU. I LOST 'EM, BILLY. THEY'RE INSIDE. EVERYTHING'S WORKING OUT PERFECTLY. I SAW CAINE HAND THAT LETTER TO HAYDEN. WHERE YOU GOING? TO GET 'EM! WE GOTTA HAVE MORE PROOF THAN THAT! WELL, LET'S GO GET IT! YOU GOTTA STOP HANDING OUT THOSE LETTERS. AW, NOW, BILLY -- I KNOW YOU WANT TO HELP YOUR FRIENDS -- WE WILL WHEN THE TIME'S RIGHT. WHEN WE GET MORE PROOF? THAT'S IT. I'M GOING OUT TO YOUR CABIN -- I'LL MEET YOU HERE LATER. YEAH --THE SHERIFF MADE A SLIP. FROM WHAT HE SAID, I GATHER IT'S FUZZY'S PARTNER. WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR? LET'S PICK HIM OFF. THEY MIGHT EXPECT THAT. NO, THERE'S A BETTER WAY OF HANDLING HIM. BUT IF THEY GOT ONE LETTER, THEY GOT 'EM ALL! I WAS WONDERING WHEN YOU'D FIGURE THAT OUT. IMAGINE IF THEY WERE CAUGHT WITH THAT MAIL. WE COULD KILL 'EM ON SIGHT! LET THE SHERIFF DO IT -- HONEST JOHN LAW ALREADY SUSPECTS CARSON. YEAH, THAT'LL KEEP US CLEAN OUT OF IT. ALL RIGHT, BOYS, GET GOIN'. DID YOU SEE WHAT I SAW? YEAH, LOOKS LIKE WE'RE GONNA GET A BREAK. HELLO, MISS JANE. HELLO, FUZZY. WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? I JUST DROPPED BY FOR A GLASS OF WATER -- IT'S MIGHTY HOT OUTSIDE. IT SURE IS. HOW YOU BEEN? OH, WE'RE GETTING ALONG. HOW ABOUT A NICE COLD GLASS OF MILK? THAT'D BE FINE. I'LL GET IT FOR YOU. THANKS, MISS JANE. YOU'RE WELCOME. MIGHTY SOOTHIN'. EVEN BEFORE YOU DRINK IT? YOU KNOW, LOVE MAKES PEOPLE ACT MIGHT FUNNY, DON'T IT? JUST PINING AWAY, WAITING TO HEAR FROM YOUR SWEETHEART. WHY, FUZZY! ARE YOU IN LOVE? WHO, ME? I AIN'T GOT NO USE FOR WOMEN, I MEAN, I -- AW, SHUCKS. NOBODY'D LOOK AT ME. I'M LOOKING AT YOU, AND I THINK YOU'RE GRAND. STOP JOSHIN' ME, MISS JANE. WHAT DO YOU HEAR FROM THAT BOY THAT LEFT TOWN A WHILE BACK? OH, YOU MEAN GARY? THAT'S HIM. DID YOU EVER GET A LETTER FROM HIM? NO, I HAVEN'T. DON'T WORRY -- YOU WILL. WELL, I GOTTA BE GOIN'. BYE, NOW. OH, THANKS FOR THE REFRESHMENTS. HE GAVE THE LETTER TO JANE WRIGHT. THAT'S EVIDENCE. LET'S GET IT, THEN WE'LL PICK HIM OFF. WHAT DO YOU WANT? WE SAW ONE OF THE BANDITS COME IN HERE. THAT WAS NO BANDIT -- THAT WAS FUZZY. DID HE GIVE YOU THIS? NO! I FOUND IT ON THE TABLE. THAT'S WHAT YOU SAY. I'LL THANK YOU TO RETURN MY PROPERTY. ASK THE SHERIFF FOR IT. HE WAS HEADIN' FOR HIS CABIN -- THE MAIL SACK MUST BE THERE. GIVE THIS TO THE SHERIFF AND BRING HIM TO FUZZY'S CABIN. ALL RIGHT, MISTER, REACH! DID YOU HEAR A SHOT? YEAH. CAME FROM OVER THAT HILL. FUZZY'S CABIN IS OVER THERE! I'M ARRESTING YOU FOR STAGECOACH ROBBERY AND MURDER. HANG ONTO HIM! I'M SORRY, SHERIFF, I TRIPPED. YOU JUST TRIPPED YOURSELF RIGHT INTO JAIL. AND FOR LIFE, IF YOU DON'T HANG. YOU AND YOUR PAL TRYING TO PUT THE BLAME ON HAYDEN -- SMART, WASN'T YOU? GIVING THAT LETTER TO JANE WRIGHT WAS A MISTAKE. WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU? SOMEBODY CONKED ME! I'LL BET YOU HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH THAT. HONESTLY, I DIDN'T. I'M TAKING YOU TO JAIL. HANG ONTO HIM WHILE I COLLECT THIS MAIL. HEY, WAIT A MINUTE. HOW YOU GONNA SHOOT ME WHEN YOUR GUN AIN'T LOADED? YOU CAN'T HOLD ME! WHAT DO YOU THINK I'M DOING? LOCK HIM UP -- THAT'S ONE OF THE STAGECOACH ROBBERS. WE'RE GOING OVER AND HAVE A TALK WITH MR. HAYDEN. ALL RIGHT, GET IN THERE. AW, LOOK, I DIDN'T KNOW THAT STUFF WAS IN MY CABIN! OH, NO? GET IN THERE!!! ALL RIGHT, GET UP! ( whistling ) THERE HE IS! COME OUT OF THERE, CARSON, WITH YOUR HANDS UP! WHAT IN THE BLAZES ARE YOU DOING HERE?! I PUT YOU IN JAIL! THE JAIL'S GOT A HOLE IN IT. A HOLE?! YEAH, THE DOOR. TAKE HIM IN, AND THIS TIME, SEE HE DON'T GET AWAY! CARSON MUST BE AROUND HERE SOMEWHERES, WE'LL SCOUR THESE HILLS. LET'S GO! Billy: ALL RIGHT, STICK 'EM UP! TIE HIM UP -- GET THAT ROPE. I'LL FEEL BETTER WHEN CARSON'S CAPTURED. I HOPE THEY KILL HIM -- I DON'T LIKE LOOSE ENDS. WHATEVER HAPPENS, WE'RE ALL SET FOR A GETAWAY. WE'D BETTER FIND ANOTHER TOWN TO MILK. PLENTY OF MONEY IN SILVER CITY. AND THE STAGES DON'T RUN TOO OFTEN. * ( barrelhouse piano ) * HEY! ARE YOU THE TWO COYOTES THAT SAID I WASN'T A DEAD SHOT? SEE THE BOTTLE OVER THERE? WELL, WATCH THIS. HEY, I THOUGHT YOU WERE IN JAIL. THE SHERIFF AIN'T GOT NOTHIN' ON ME. HE'S OUT CHASIN' CARSON. HOPE HE CATCHES HIM,TOO. WHAT'S ALL THE SHOOTING ABOUT? THESE COYOTES DON'T BELIEVE THAT I'M "DEAD SHOT" JONES, AND I'M PROVIN' IT TO 'EM. SEE THE CANDLE IN THAT BOTTLE OVER THERE? WELL, WATCH THIS. HA HA HA! HA HA HA! YOU COULDN'T HIT THE SIDE OF A BARN. THIS MONEY HERE SAYS THAT I CAN OUTSHOOT ANYBODY IN THE PLACE. LOOKS LIKE EASY MONEY. I'LL TAKE HIM ON -- FIFTY DOLLARS A SHOT. I'LL HOLD THE STAKES. I'LL SHOOT FIRST. HA HA! HEY... YOU CAN'T WIN EVERY TIME -- I'LL BET YOU ANOTHER FIFTY. YOU'RE ON. ( gunshots ) SURROUND THE PLACE! HOW DID YOU GET OUT OF JAIL? SO YOU LIED -- WHAT IS THIS, A TRICK? ( explosion ) Sheriff: HOLD IT! THE SHERIFF'S GOT HIM! GET AROUND FRONT. TAKE CARE OF THESE TWO, SHERIFF. GET UP ON YOUR FEET! I FOUND ENOUGH EVIDENCE IN THAT SAFE TO HANG YOU, HAYDEN. YOU CAN'T PIN A MURDER RAP ON ME -- HE DID THE KILLINGS. NOW, WAIT A MINUTE -- IF I DON'T MISS MY GUESS, YOU'LL ALL SWING! BART, LOCK 'EM UP! JUST A MINUTE. GO AHEAD. THESE ARE THE PAPERS THAT BILLY GAVE ME OUTSIDE. HERE'S THE CHECK YOU'VE BEEN EXPECTING, GEORGE. I GOT A LITTLE WORRIED, BILLY -- I THOUGHT YOUR PLAN WASN'T GOING TO WORK.
