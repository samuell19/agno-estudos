Mum... What are you doing? - What are you doing? - Drafting an invoice. Come. - Mum? - Hmm... - Come. - What do you want? Come here for a second. Mum, when you come, can you bring me a snack? - Honey, I'm busy. - Mum! Mom, do it because you love me. What? Do it because you love me. I can't hear you! Just come! Have you taken out the garbage? Mom, can you come for a minute? Do you see how she is? - Leave her alone, she's working. - But I need her to come for a second. - She will, she will in a bit. - But she's taking forever. Mom... Come! Geez, finally! Young lady, have you taken the garbage out yet? Yup. I did. Don't lie to me, missy. I'll torture you. Ouch, stop it! I took it out. Boy, I'm feeling so lazy. Hey you, you haven't taken it out yet! - Yep, I don't think she took it out. - Okay, okay! I'll do it in a bit... The garbage is still there, it was more of a rhetorical question really. Why didn't you take it out before you started to watch movies, Ade? 'Cuz I'll take it out in a second. When will that be exactly? - Ready? Done? - Out! Can I use your lip-gloss? - The... - The pink one? Yup. It's right there. Where can I stand? For what? To put on the lip-gloss! Now, let's go with... 1, 2, 3, 4... - We'll have to put another one here. - Yes, we have to move... Let's bring that one over here! Do we bring these chairs down or do we take them out? - Yeah, we'll have to... - Do we need these ones? Yes, those are also part of the... So let's... let's bring them all down right now or not? Let's put them here and we'll see how to make it happen. Do you want it a bit lower than... no, no. No, right? No. Okay we need... two more. Good... I need another couple of little roses here. This works here because... the purple needs to... To be highlighted otherwise it gets lost. Some little petals? 'Cuz that flower is really beautiful. All right. The problem isn't not to have sex but to have bad sex. Bad sex. That would indeed be a problem. That is indeed a problem. - Man, that's super sad, isn't it? - Tough... Really really tough. - What would be worse? - About what? Not having sex for seventy years... or having bad sex for seventy years? I'd rather have bad sex. Instead of not getting any? - Yes. - Totally. Actually yes, definitely. Yeah, I'd rather... Or you'd prefer nothing, I mean, to end up with nothing. I'm not sure, because both options are kind of sad. But have you seen the sex toys... for men? Are there sex toys for men? Have you ever gone to a sex shop? That's the question. - Never. I haven't. - I have. - Take me with you next time! - We can all go together. - There are many toys for men. Many. - And what kind of toys are there? There's one that's like a little egg... and it comes with a kind of rubber. - And you guys put it on. - Dude, Ade is a bit sick, right? - There are things made for you. - Have you bought that or something? Well, no 'cuz I don't have where to put the rubber on, man. - Well, this is all new new for me! - Listen, there are all sorts of things. Trust me. There are some creams to prevent you from coming too soon... - There are flavoured creams. - There are others to make you come quickly I actually had heard a bit about the cream. - The cream to last forever, dude? - It's really more like a spray that you put... - Can I bum a cigarette? - Sure. You sure know where to put it on. On the tip. - On the tip? On the little head? - On the little head. - Hey, are we seriously having this conversation? - Serious stuff, right? - I need a smoke for that. - It's not transcendental to talk about sex. - No, it's not. Actually, there’s still a huge taboo about it, right? I mean, there are people who don't like going to a sex shop. - I think it's the most normal thing in the world. - There are glass dildos. I don't think it's wrong to go to one and hang out there. No big deal. It’s cool to try different things. - We have to go, Antonio. - We have to go? Fuck dude. Let's go then. - You don't wanna share with me? - I don’t want to share with anyone. You've reached the voicemail system. Charges will apply as of now. Record your message after the beep. When you have finished hang up or press 1 for more options. Ade please call us. We're in the car looking for Cata's new address, because your dad can't find the piece of paper with the address, and you're not picking up... Please pick up, call us back or something. Okay, bye. Shoot, I forgot to tell her that your cell phone is dead. Don't worry. If she calls she'll figure it out. Here... I thought we had taken out the coffee. What? That I thought we had taken out the coffee, but we didn't. Hey, why don't you make five arepas in case we want more. - I mean, let's finish the package. - Okay, take it out. Let's finish the package and we'll all have some... - The other one? - Yeah, the last one. Is this water ready? We have to wait for it to boil. Okay, we'll have big chunks of tomatoes with onions. Yeah? That doesn't matter. What matters is the love you put into it. - What did you say? - Are you having black coffee, auntie? No, I think I'd better pass. Or maybe with a bit of milk? If there's any. If not, no worries. I dunno if we bought milk. - I don't drink a lot of black coffee? - - I want one. - Would you like tea? - There's tea. - Herbal tea? - I want a black coffee. Maybe a tea...yeah, thank you. You want what? I want a black coffee, with a bit of milk maybe. But did you buy milk? Did my dad get milk? Maybe not. Just black tea is ok, don't worry about it. Here, let's start washing some of these. Yeah, 'cuz I remember that you drink coffee, right? Yeah, but as I'm gonna be on the road in a bit... better if I don't. - There's no milk? Isn't that milk? - Oh, yeah! - Here, where should we put this? Put it there. - There is whole milk. - This is bad. - Yeah, what's wrong with it? - Just the coffee then. - Yep, it's expired. Here, auntie. - Put it there and I'll wash it. - No auntie, you're not washing dishes now! - I'll rinse a few things here, don't worry. - No, no, no. Leave it. - Go sit down instead. Wash your hands. - No, but... - Everything is under control. - But, we’re doing fine, aren’t we? “We’re doing fine…” No, No, leave it! - I’ll wash this plate and that’s it. - What happened, what did you do? It's just that this is the one I was using. Just one more and I promise I'll go sit and be a good girl. - Yes, auntie, be a good girl! - Argh, why is this not... It's okay, don't tell me. No worries. I mean, after, after the... You don't have to tell me. I dunno. It's 'cuz everything, I know. I know, I can tell by looking at you... I mean, it's not written on your face but... But there's something there. I like someone else, as well... That's another thing, I like someone else. I'm not sure if that's why... or if that's what makes me want to move and make a decision right now. I don't even know if I'm gonna be with this other person, it's not... I think this has been there... I think this has been there before all this, hasn't it? Yeah, it's been in there for a long time! A long time. A long time. Of course, I'm scared... Yeah, but, I mean, it won't be the first time you separate, so... I wonder, is this the best guy I'll meet in my life? The one who'll treat me the best? ...Am I going to lose him? But have you've done anything... I'm sure you have... To make it work again, or are you more like ... just there kind of waiting to see what happens? - Yeah... I mean, the thing is that now I also have a person stuck right here in my head all the time, so... So I don't want to... no... I don't feel like... like saving the relationship, no. Well, but it's not that he has done much, right? - Yeah... - He’s kind of just stayed there... - No, he... of course he tries. - But have you guys talked about it? Of course we've talked about it. But you haven't told him? Yeah, I've told him that I feel... it's obvious that the relationship is not well and we're both wondering 'do we stay together or do we split up'? We're both thinking about it... Of course I haven't told him that I'm attracted to someone else! - No, that would be... - This is crazy. Obviously... Fran? Yes? - Can you help me? - Yep, I'll be right there. - Yep? - Look! - Nice, I like it! - It..it..I'll tuck it in, obviously. Sure, but I like it, I like it a lot. But take a good look! I'm looking at it, and I like it. That's why I tell you I like it. Why, does something worry you? Well, because... yes, a little. What is it? Let me see. I think it's cute. You look beautiful. - Don't you think it's a bit... see-through? I think it’s see-through. And I like that a lot. All right then. - What’s this? - What? - Is this normal? - What? This, that it crumples here like this. Can he drive now? Yep, he can drive now. Oh, Francisco. No. We're kind of tipsy. - On with the croutons! - With the French croutons! Let’s do the crouton thing! Hey, you guys, seriously… Let’s do the crouton thing with a margarita! - C’mon, let’s behave like adults. - Are you gonna make margaritas now? - No, I mean Margarita, the chip brand.. - Lets behave like adults for a bit. Man, that 'margarita talk' made me think ‘wow, let’s switch to margaritas’ Yes, I also thought we were moving on to tequila! Let's go to Las Margaritas! What are Las Margaritas? Some lady friends of yours? They're these flowers that promise to love you... - A flower that Fran really liked. - A motel just outside of Cali! - The house of some of his aunts… - Las Margaritas was this place… It’s a flower that Fran loved. - Yeah, right… - Cheers, Fran! What are Las Margaritas? Probably some brothel run by some floozies, by some friends of yours from Tuluá… - Some of his nieces. - We’re not brothel-type of guys. No? So more whore house in the Pance river types, then? - We’re more five-star hotel-types. - Yeah, right… But ok, Las Margaritas does sound just like a total brothel. I’d open a brothel called Las Margaritas. It would be a resounding success. What? You would open a whorehouse and call it Las Margaritas? And who would manage it? The owner! - Welcome! -Don't be so trashy! You'll have to open it in a small town in Cundinamarca. I don't see it being a hit in Bogotá, Francisco. - Right, but it'd totally work in Pance. - Anything you open there works. - In Pance everything flourishes. - In Pance La guana would be a hit. - Are there any brothels in Pance? - There must be more than one, I think. - Hey, we haven't been! - Dunno, I know The Stone. - What stone? - Pance's big stone. And what happens there? You “get nailed” on the stone? - Well, you sun tan on it. - Wow, that sounded rough. The myth says, “I ‘gave’ myself down at Pance’s Stone.” No, but that's not a brothel! I didn't "give" myself to anyone at the Pance Stone. You didn't? Nah, I'm a refined person. For me, it has to be an apartment. For me, it has to be the Tayrona beach. You need a beach, the sand, the silica. No, can you imagine me at the Tayrona Beach, in a crappy tent rented for $15,000 pesos? Shame on you darling. And then you complain 'cuz your little girl is making the wrong choice. I mean, seriously! I'm an apartment kinda girl, and the dude has to be the owner! Okay girls. Don't! Look, that's the solution. We found it. Daddy, don't! Argh, I can't find any of my clothes. Would you like some? A little bit. Ha, almost half of it. - Didn't you want some? - Nope. - I've had like four this morning. - I can imagine. - That's pretty normal, isn't it? - Well... - Four? Well... not four, maybe 2. - Mom, I need to ask you a favour. - Yes. It's just that Cata needs to talk to me, and well... She wrote me asking if I could go over to her place for a little bit, not too long. You already know the answer to that. You cannot do it by chat? As if you guys never ever use chat. C'mon, this is serious, she's actually sad. Tell her to come over. She can joins us for lunch. - No... - Why not? Well, because, she wants to be with me, just the two of us... - You can be alone in... - In your bedroom. I know, in my room, but what I mean is that... I dunno, she said she's feeling really sad and wants to talk alone... With me... She wants to talk alone? Let her speak to herself, sounds good to me. Stop bugging me! So at her place you'll talk in her room anyway... If you want we can go nearby, like just to the mall or something. No Ade. You're grounded and you won't go out. - But I’m telling you, I need… - She can come here. Can I speak? You're speaking. Great. Thank you. - Yours. - Let's see what it says.? Devote a moment to rearrange the furniture in your home. Try to seize this moment and don't ruin it by expecting praise. Today you woke up with a great... with a strong tendency for premature careless and revolutionary decisions. Try to balance your day with some protective silence that will stop you from making big mistakes. You need to practice a sport and keep a balanced and detoxifying diet. Do not miss work needlessly. If you're not in a good mood, try to take a couple of days off. You can solve this problem without losing either money or the position you've achieved. New friendships are just around the corner. - Watch out! - C'mon. What do you think it means? - I mean... - Can I have a smoke? Yeah, of course. The battery ran out! Argh, it was super cute. Here. I'll have a smoke too. Hey, we have to cut back, we're smoking a lot again, you know? Especially you. Like when we become old old ladies... Hey, it's a really beautiful day, right? - What? - About what? Nothing. - I really like hanging out like this. - Yeah, it's really fun. - Isn't it? - Yes, super fun. - Why are you being so weird? - What? - Why are you being so weird? When? - Just now. - Not at all. Why? No... It's just that I kind of saw a text message that you just got on your cell. - Excuse me? - Yep. - So, what about it? - Well, I dunno... Maybe I'm just crazy. Don't you get texts from many people? Don't you? Well, yeah, from my girlfriends. I dunno. - Ah, so you also have a lot of girlfriends. - Yep. And this friend of yours... I dunno' ...don't wanna sound like I'm jealous or anything like that... But... I dunno, I thought it was funny... What did you think was funny? A text from one of your girlfriends. Why? I dunno. Dude, it's normal. We all send texts, right? Yep... You send messages? Don't you? I'm sure you do, right? Right, but who is she, can I know? - What? - Who is she? A friend. What happened? Nothing. Nothing happened. Nothing... So where were you then? ...if nothing happened. Around. Around? Do you think that's an answer? Well, I dunno... ask her. No, I'm asking you. No, ask her, she's the one who knows all the answers. But, where were you? No, you're the one who knows all the answers. Oh yes, me? So tell me then! Yes, you! Answer your father's question. No. I'm not gonna answer anything. Why won't you answer? Why? Well, because I don't feel like it. So what? Didn't you send me to my room as soon as I got in? 'Cuz that's all you care about, right? Just to send me to my room. - Go to your room. - No. - Go Adela please. - What for? Go. We'll talk later. Didn't you wanna talk to me? So tell me then. But I don't wanna talk to you right now. Ah, so it's just your opinion what counts. And hers. You guys are allowed to talk. You can express your things, your problems and stuff. But I cannot say anything. 'Cuz you never say anything in this house. We never let you talk. You've never ever said what you think. Never, ever. No, I'm not the one playing the victim here. I'm sorry. You're the victim here. Okay. That's it. That's it. - You know what mom? - Adelaida, go to... Adelaida. Can I speak? No! Can I speak? You know what? No, you cannot speak. You cannot speak. He told you to go to your room, did he not? You cannot speak. No more talking, or chatting... That's it. It's done. Adelaida go. Go and we'll talk tomorrow. - I feel very sorry for you mom. - Adelaida, please! Adelaida! I feel very sorry for you... with that sad face... that bored face. I'm sorry we're not the beautiful family that you imagined for your life. What a drag to have to see that face of frustration that you have every day. Of tiredness. I'm sorry my dad is the way he is. I'm sorry I'm the way I am. I'm sorry that your life doesn't work. Okay, that's it please! Adelaida, look at me! Look at me! Now you're gonna explain the world to us...and tell us the history of humanity. Wow! I'm not gonna explain the world. I'm just saying that I feel sorry for your face full of frustration all the time. - Your face of anger towards the world. - You've said it. Are you done now? Ok, enough, please? I understood it, I heard it, I got it. Ok, enough, please. Enough. That's it. Adelaida! Why don't you go to your room instead! Adelaida, go to your room. Go now. Please go, ok? Fuck this. Fuck this. Why do I have to go? I'm not gonna go. I'm not gonna go. Fuck this. Why do I have to go if I'm telling my mom... Go to your room right now Adelaida. Off you go. Off you go, I don't wanna see you here anymore. Go and we'll talk tomorrow. Go. What if I don't wanna talk tomorrow? We' ll see. You guys can talk. I won't. I love you. This is gross! Here, Ade. It's hot. Hold it from the top and I'll open it for you. From the top 'cuz it's hot. - Feeling any better? - It's super hot. - It was boiling. - Did you put on cinnamon? Anise, for the little tummy. It's boiling. Wanna cuddle with me? Of course, my sweetheart. Oops, your cell phone just fell. Leave it there. Pass me a cushion. - Hey, what fell? - Pass me that cushion. What? Something fell in the kitchen, right? I heard a noise. No. That's weird. Heal, heal. Frog's little bum. If it doesn't heal today it will heal tomorrow. So you don't remember that you used to run then? No. - Would you like to run again? - No. All blushed and sweaty... Nope. - My little baby. My little baby. - I can't have anymore. My little baby. I'm done, I don't want any more ice cream. Can we change them up? - Change them up? - I don't want any more. - Ah, you want to eat mine? - Yes. - Eat this one... Nope. - Please! - I don't like it. C'mon! Do it for your daughter's well-being. - Just leave it there. - No, 'cuz that's bad. So eat it then. Plus, you said 'I wanna sit here and have my ice cream in peace'. All right. Don't eat it then. I'll just have the cream, ok? We can give it to that dog. Dogs don't eat ice cream, do they? Sure they do. Don't they? Of course they do. They taste the milk. Sweet? Cold? Yep, they eat it. Did you see? We even got you flowers. I just saw the pasta! You walked in with your eyes closed... Right, I thought that the present was the pasta... And the cake, of course. No, we didn't get any cake 'cuz, you know... Okay, I dunno what it is But... it smells like... It smells like something. Like cookies or something. We got muffins from a bakery... where they sell sugar-less muffins. You made muffins? No, we bought them. For real. They sell them without any any any sugar at all. And with... quinoa... oatmeal... almond dough. So they don't taste like anything but... they taste pretty good. The other day, we ordered a cake - For a wedding? - With oatmeal dough. Yes. With oatmeal dough and passion fruit cream, yummy. And low fat... Yep, I actually tried... A passion fruit muffin but... I couldn't find any. Coz' I know you really like passion fruit. You are a Begonia bulb, that almost looks like a rose, a Tahitian star where the fruits taste like Bora Bora. Where everything yummy is made by you, from veggies to tiramisu. Tonight is a starry night... - You're the best thing in my life - You're my happiness. You are my happiness. You're the best thing in my life. Tonight is a starry night. It's a starry night. And it is your night. Aw, happy birthday! - Thank you my love! - Now you have to make a wish... Blow the candle. I love you. What? I couldn't hear you... - I love you. - Come, my love! - Can we sing it again? -Here we go, one... - But while I blow the...? - Yes, that's right. One, two, three... How does it start? You are a Begonia bulb, that almost looks like a rose, a Tahitian star where the fruits taste like Bora Bora. Where everything yummy is made by you, from veggies to tiramisu. Today your life lengthens... You are my happiness! You are my happiness! The heart is a muscle structure. Let's imagine that it's a... a small house all made of muscle. And this house is divided into four internal chambers or rooms. Namely the auricles and the ventricles, right? So what happens? The main wall inside this little house is... Which is also made out of muscle, has increased size. Okay? So, as it has increased size, that house... that wall... Makes the space available for blood to flow inside the heart, smaller. There's less space. I mean, not as much blood will be able to accommodate in that ventricle. Which is that small room. And then, on a given moment the blood flow won't be adequate and it won't be enough... So then the person collapses, and it leads to a sudden death which is what happened in Lena's case. Normally, well it happens when... When it's associated to exercising or to a situation where the body demands or requires more blood. And in Lena's case it happened while she was asleep. But... Well, it generally occurs just like this... In a very sudden manner, right? That, that muscle, that volume that increased inside doesn't allow for the blood to flow adequately inside the heart. Hi. Thanks. You don't want any more? Yes, but in a little while. She had always wanted to... No, she didn't do... like... Architecture? Architecture. Right. Architecture. And she makes plans and stuff. And... and... - Draws plans. - Plan? Plans? 'Cuz "that" plan is like... "genre plans", right? - Like drawing plans. - Yes, drawing plans. 'Cuz making plans, that's different. So, she made all the plans... - She drew the plans. - Drew the plans for our house, and... - In France or here? - Yeah, in France. And why did you move to Colombia? - Why make that change? - 'Cuz... 'cuz... Because she wanted to learn to speak more Spanish. And to do the BAC here. Why, because the training for the BAC is better in this school? Yeah, it's like more... That's right, the round shapes are more... We have to do things with more, like they're more... they're easier... More sensual, like you were saying. Exactly. More sensual, and more subtle... The hug, or... the kiss. What happened? I broke a glass. How? It slipped from my hand. There's a shard there. Hello... Adelaida... - Adelaida! - What! - Adelaida, where are you? - What! Where are you? Where would I be? Adelaida? What do you want? - Open the door. - What for? - We need to talk. -About what? About your friend Jerónimo. Open the door. What do you wanna talk about? I wanna know why your friend is coming in the afternoons when I'm not in. Because he has permission to come in. - Permission? - Yeah. He doesn't have my permission. Open up. - Yep, I let him in. - Open the door! - Why are you getting in this late? - Open up! - Open the door right now! - Answer me! I've had enough of this, Adelaida, open the door. I'm tired, exhausted, I can't take it anymore, open up... Poor you. Do you have permission to come home this late? Open up. - Why don't you answer me? - Open the door! - Why don't you tell me truth? - Open the door right now! - What's happening with you? - About what? Neither Jerónimo or anyone else is allowed in. When I'm not here, If I don't authorize it, nobody comes in. - Why? Just 'cuz you say so? - Because I say so! - Why? - And you won't close this door again. - I don't want you to close it again. - Well, I'm gonna close it. You will not close it again, and that's it! I'm not talking to you anymore. I don't wanna hear any more. Well, you're not talking, you're yelling. You want some? Nope. What do you say? Should we do a cross or little squares? - A cross, just as they are. - Right? Yeah, in a cross. - Auntie? - Yeah... Do you believe in God? Yes... of course... Yes, I believe there's a superior being. Why? Well, because I look around me and everything is so perfect that there must be something superior that moves it. I wouldn't know how to describe it... But sure there's something that binds all things together in the universe, and moves us all. But... Did you decide to believe in God? Well, I haven't asked myself that question... But since I was born... Well I think it's also because of the influence of my family upbringing but throughout the years, well, maybe I believe in a different way, but I still believe in that energy. Maybe not in the way I was taught at home. To pray and pass rosaries or beads, or... Adore an image. But I do believe that there's... It's necessary to have something that's superior to us, a spirituality that can help us... Help us to let go a little bit of all this, right? - To let go of life? - Of the material world... Of how tough reality is... Yeah... I know that's not easy for you. Or maybe you have a different understanding of things. Do you... do you pray? Hmm... Not much... So in which way do you maybe connect with something superior... or you don't believe it's necessary? My mom gave a Buddha... Well, to my dad and I... Okay... I see. - Yours. - Mine? Yeah, but it's a bit hot. So eat it with your thingy. Eat it with this. Okay. - Thank you very much. - Eat it while it's hot. - But is it this way? - No, this way. - This is... - Thank you very much. Wow, it has an incredible taste. We can start producing it and selling it! Producing it? No. We'll have an ice cream factory. - Here's yours. - What, I have two? - This is yours. - Thank you. - For me? - Oh, Fran got a bitten one... - He got a bitten one. - You got the strawberry one. I like the strawberry one a lot. This one is ... this one is mine. Hey, I spilled some... I need you to clean me. This one is really good. I have... some napkins. Please clean me up or else I'll get scolded because my clothes got dirty. What about me, Kala? You'll have to clean me up a little bit too. - Oh, great, thank you. - Thank you very much. Hey, you guys have sleeves! Yeah, I rolled them up 'cuz I was a little bit hot. Look, Fran rolled them too. Yours are really long, look... Wow, that's nice. Mine are long 'cuz I'm cold and cannot take them off. - That's ok there, right? - Yep. I could have... I'll do that one... These ones are shiny. Yeah. I like it better when they shine. More than the matte finish. Although matte is cool too. - But 'cuz of the black. -Yep. Okay, we're done with this one. You know what's the thing? They take a long time to dry. Especially that green. Let me paint one of them. - Better to do these ones now, no?. - Yes. Hello... Ade? Adelaida? Adelaida? Adelaida? Adelaida? Hi... Do you remember how you got here? Yeah. You could barely walk. Can you imagine the risk being out and about like that? Argh, now you're gonna lecture me, dad? No. No, I no longer have strength to lecture you. You never have strength for anything. It makes me really sad to see you like that, really sad. Okay, get outta here. - That's the worst, this plan of yours. - Okay. Yeah, go, get outta here. Go lecture someone else. Are you mad at me? Do you forgive me?
