They're moving away...the filthy bastards! Will they be recaptured? Can't do much before daylight. - A pipe? - Thanks, corporal. Until then... we've got the best spot. So you still refuse to talk? You were friendly with the convicts Vautrin and Calvi... You're sure to know something about their escape.. So talk! Speak up! Ball and chain for these men from tomorrow...and 20 days in solitary. Take them away! This is a nice mess...gentlemen... congratulations!... It's one thing for Calvi to escape... but Vautrin... Vautrin, the most dangerous hoodlum of our time! You let him get away! There were circumstances... Circumstances!...I am the one responsible for this penal colony... in the eyes of His Majesty... A penal colony that is meant to be escape-proof!... Who was in charge of the watch? You'll be waiting somewhat longer for your promotion to captain. You'll be under close arrest from tomorrow. Lieutenant Serbin, take 40 men... Search the farms, barns and churches... Mr de Niron... alert the police stations right away in La Rochelle, Cognac and Jonzac. Unlikely they'd tell you about their stash! They probably fooled you. There are two things I don't like, Calvi... That I have to do all the work... and people?s opinions. You've nothing to fear from me... I stopped to rest and I did not know of your presence... Besides...I'm alone... and I'm not armed... and I'm a priest... Who are you? Father Don Carlos Herrera... He DID come to take a rest. I've never killed! It's not a murderer I need... it's a man! Scram! Go and find us some fresh horses. We need to sleep in Poitiers tonight. Reverend...we'll need to stop for a while... We have to repair the rear axle... if we're going to get through on these damn roads! "Ad augusta per augusta" my friend. To a noble destiny by narrow paths... Hurry...it still feels like prison here. We got through to here... The hard part's done. But I'm in the greatest hurry of any abbot in France! At your command, Reverend! Woe to he who transgresses! What can I offer you, Reverend? Anjou?...Loire?...Muscadet? Bring me...a glass of water. I'm from a monastery where alcohol is unknown. Very well, Reverend. There you are, Reverend Thank you, my child. Miss!... But that's much too much, sir! That's it. Where does it go through there, my child? To the river, Reverend... This is a very poetic place to drown yourself, sir! That's my business, Reverend... I can't see how you can assume that... This, my child... Your tears and this piece of paper... No need to read it to know that it's a goodbye... A symbol of youth...to write to those you leave. You still deny it? But I've nothing to deny. Be on your way, Reverend. Your comfort is useless to me. I don't believe in God. I'm an atheist. I'm from Spain, sir. We don't believe in atheists down there. Tell me why you want to die... Do you have an incurable illness? Yes, Father...poverty! A diamond knows not its value. Confide your troubles in me, my son. It is a love affair gone wrong? What can grieve you... at your age? Dishonour, Father. I fled Paris...deeply in debt. I owe 15,000 francs to a moneylender. 15,000 isn't enough to drown yourself over. That's not all... Before the payment date... I lost my head and did something wrong... I forged my brother-in-law's signature... And as he was unable to pay... he was thrown into prison. I've no choice but to die. You have too much heart and not enough brains... Fate is only worth what we judge it to be... To you rate yours at 15,000 francs? I'm inclined to pay you more. -YOU...Father? - Yes, me... I'll give you proof. I think it'll hold together 'til Poitiers. You can rest assured, sir... Look... There are 30,000 crowns here... Tonight at Poitiers, I'll give you what will free your brother.... and give you back the will to live. You'd do that for me? Later this evening... Why would you do it? Because I'm interested in you... As fate would have it...I met you on the verge of suicide... Because you moved me... We can leave, Reverend... Go on ahead and wait for me! I was talking to people here... Calvi let himself be caught. May God forgive him. A few minutes walking doesn't bother you? Come on...I want to talk to you... privately. Believe me...in my experience, you've been very unwise... Only those who make the laws get around them... not those who have to obey them. The small fry are to serve... not to be served. I understand that too well, Father. We've been chatting a long time without introducing ourselves... I'm Abbot Carlos de Herrera, honorary canon at Toledo Cathedral... ...on a mission for His Majesty. My titles are more obscure, Mr Abbot... My mother is of noble birth... I might have been a marquis. My unlucky star didn't want it... My name's Lucien Chardon. And you suffer from it, right? -You're ambitious? -To die from it... Better to live... Would you like to succeed? I can take you very far down the way to power. I saved your life... Consent to be mine. I'll make your fortune. Once again...Why? Because I'm alone... One of the most dreadful sorts of solitude... That of the soul... Whether he's a convict or a leper... infamous or sick... Man has only one thought... ...to find an accomplice or companion to his destiny. Would you be that? What a strange priest you are! Do not be fooled by appearances... You've been hunted out of Paris? You be back there in your coach within 6 months... ...with your marquis arms engraved on the doors. Obey...and you'll be as great you were small... I shall plan, you will execute... And Paris will belong to us! Success has a secret that I don't know. That's is the secret of success... ...straight to the point and quick about it!... I don't have as steady a hand as you. I don't want you to hold the gun... I want you to be the bullet! Father...I'm yours! Off we go! Servants of the Marquis de Rubempr?... Servants of the Marquis de Rubempr?...... Your lordship! Thank you my friend. Lucien? I didn't want to let you leave without a more personal goodbye.. How do you want me? Mad as you are... I'm afraid your father would guess the reason for your absence. The duke doesn't think much of me. But his daughter loves you. I love you, Lucien. Don't take offence at my father's distrust... Think about how far you've come in 6 months... You came as Lucien Chardon and here you are... Lucien de Rubempr?... A marquis and now received in our house... ''Received'' ? You mean "tolerated". Come now... don't be so down... I bear one of the great names of France... Before agreeing to let me change it... my father would require guarantees... He acts as a father... So act as a lover!... If you love me... Do you have any doubt? No, because I want to live. I know I'm not as pretty as a lot of other women... but I also know what I'm worth. Let ambition make you love me... ...and I'll bring you to loving me for love! I love you Clotilde! Don't make me too happy... ...lest I have too much regret someday. - Good night! -You're leaving so early this evening... Is Madame de S?risy so impatient? Don't be cruel... My life is suspended until I see you again... I'm going home... I'll see you tomorrow. A handsome guy... masked for the opera ball! He's come to steal us away! Lucien ! Lucien Chardon ! It's you! Our Lucien!... I told you he was in Paris. Lover! Isn't he handsome...well-dressed! CHEERS FOR LUClEN CHARDON ! Gentlemen...please excuse me! Very happy... to see you in Paris again... Mr Chardon... You seem to be right back in the saddle... Congratulations! You did very well in the provinces? Not everyone takes advantage of Parisians' gullibility! You're getting rather testy Monsieur Chardon... Monsieur de Rastignac, call me by my name... I am Marquis de Rubempr?... under a royal decree... I HAD heard that. You're welcome to repeat it. So...Long live the king!... Monsieur de Rubempr?. He knows how to choose his gentlemen. ''De Rubempr?'' ? Little Lucien Chardon has finally got to use his ancestors. His noble line is far older than yours... Madame Marquise d'Empire! Wait 'til the gold on your crest is dry before judging others! What impertinence! What a pity I didn't get a chance to slap him! This Chardon is making his mark... and somebody's sponsoring him. Should he trip up... I'll crush him! You? You'll lose you place in paradise. And you're wasting your time! You're not at the Hotel Grandlieu? I'm on my way. I came here because... I was feeling sad. Clotilde doesn't love you anymore? She leans on her father... What's he got against you? You're a marquis! A marquis without land. If I become a landowner... I get the hand of his daughter! Which would cost... 600,000 francs. We'll have to find someone who's got it! Lucien! Do you know who I just left? The charming Madame de S?risy... She's waiting for you in her dressing-room. That's all I have to say. Thanks, old man! Ah, Madame de S?risy ! Very good!... She loves you, she can be useful... Off you go, my son! I took you to be a trustworthy boy, Lucien... When Diane saw you... I refused to believe it! I'm hoping my eyes didn't deceive me... Standing there in your finery? Is this in our honour? Apparently not! Sit down! Have you already forgotten about Mademoiselle de Grandlieu? By the way...how's your affair going? Has the duke succumbed to your charms? Somewhat slowly, madame. He'll come 'round! Clotilde loves you. When one has the heart of a place... the walls tumble down. You'll soon be Monsieur Clotilde de Grandlieu. No fear about that! You're cruel!... No...jealous! I have to leave you... You're already running away? I'm really forced to... Tomorrow I have to go hunting... It's going to be a long day. Go on then...you're a scoundrel! Could I see you the day after tomorrow? There'll be gaming tables... Isn't it the man who's supposed to ask such things? Yes...but none of us are perfect...are we? My dear...you really are badly in love with that boy! Do you mean I don't love him enough? You love him too much... and too obviously! Hearts only burn well in uncertainty. Mine burns enough for two! My angel! Esther, my darling! It really is you, Lucien! I was so afraid you wouldn't be able to come! So afraid! I've been watching for your signal since I arrived... For several minutes my whole life was on hold. My angel! We can't stay here... 20 people have recognized me already. I've had to smile... defend myself...lie... ...losing the minutes I was keeping for you! We'll have to separate. Already? We can meet again at your place. So what have I got to complain about? See you later! Monsieur de Rastignac? What do you want with me? To speak to you as a friend... Not a friendship I'd like... Monsieur Masked One! You don't know my voice? How about my face? Vautrin? So you're out of prison? Yes...Just to recommend a friend of mine to you! Who are you talking about? The Marquis de Rubempr?... I would like you to like him, Mr Rastignac... I like those who please me. Make him one who pleases you! Otherwise?... I haven't forgotten how you reached your place in the world! Monsieur de Rubempr? will be one of my friends. Monsieur MARQUIS de Rubempr?! I stress the difference... it cost me a lot. Goodbye. Mademoiselle, I'm confused ... Pardon me! How could I have been so clumsy? Don't worry... it doesn't matter at all! Mademoiselle.... Here... I tore the dress of the prettiest woman at the ball! I feel it will take me a lifetime to make amends... I'd much rather forgive you right now!...Goodbye sir! But, mademoiselle......... That's a dress that could cost you dearly, Baron! Why?... Do you know that beauty? Nothing special about it... That's the beautiful Esther... You'll find her at 15 Rue de Langlade... Knock on the door with a gold piece! -A whore? -Courtesan, Baron!... An unscrupulous one. I am rich... and she is beautiful!... That's not the first pretty woman you've looked at! No...but it's the first one that looked at me, Rastignac... Goodbye, Nucingen. Hey...that was 15 Rue de Langlade wasn't it? Thanks my friend... Angel...you're so clumsy! Right now, a badly-tied tie is hardly relevant! So...my true love... what are you going to do about it? I want you to be as handsome as possible... Even if it's only the night and me who sees you... Remember that pride is a sin! I'm proud of being yours! I wonder if a joy like mine is not a challenge to the heavens. Six months of happiness... what have I done to deserve it? Happiness and deserts are two lords who often go to war with each other. Until tomorrow my love. I'll be counting the hours that separate us. The hours, days, your worldly life... Madame de S?risy the renowned beauty... Clotilde de Grandlieu and several others. You envy them? I pity them...because it's me that you love! Until tomorrow... Until tomorrow. Here you are Angel... here they are! Who are you? The Abbot Don Carlos Herrera. I see that he spoke to you about me... Young people have no secrets from their lovers. He loves you...is that right? He told me so. My happiness depends on believing it. A shared love...one hears? Pointless question, Father... For six months we've only lived for each other. All very well...but... does he know what you are? What I was...yes. He also knows that I've become a new and decent woman for him. I've no doubt about that... but love is a fragile sentiment. I don't accept that, Father... nothing can separate the two of us! Nothing! Even if he was to kill himself? Why should he kill himself? He's happy. Why is he happy? I put on the road to fortune... And I on the road to happiness! Somebody else might feel that way... Not him! He's ambitious... as you well know. If that success eludes him... and he is finished... It's not your love that will save him. Come on now... Tears have never fixed anything... We must learn to bow to the inevitable, my child... Let's say Lucien loves you and you love him... But concede that I have rights over him... My life is nothing without him... If you take him...you're taking me. Who said anything about taking you two? I'm only asking for his social life... his future... The rest is yours! But I have to be obeyed... in his own best interests.. Do you accept that? Tell me what to do! I'll obey because I care for him. Very good my child... Now you're listening to reason. Youth! You like music, Reverend? Enough not to have it abused in my presence! Went out at 9 o'clock... He's gone to the Spanish Embassy. He was accompanied to the door by the 1st Councillor... ...who seemed to hold him in high esteem... Your impression? There's been mistake... It's certainly Carlos Herrera. It's Vautrin ! He managed to fool the Spanish Embassy... he doesn't fool me. I'll send him back to the dungeons. Back already, Lucien? I was thinking of you on the Champs-Elys?es... I have to speak to you. I know... So?... I'm listening. It is so difficult for you to admit that you're returning from Esther's? Had the bird flown the nest? What? You know? You saw us at the Opera!... Where is she? Where I put her... This woman was something between us that should never have existed... a lie and a secret! When I open up the salons of Grandlieu to you... ...it's not so you can go wallowing in the gutter! bring her back to me...I love her... Do you want that I should die?... No...I want you alive... ...in the life you have to have. And what if I should choose a different one for myself? I see that you need the truth... I war you.. it'll hit you like a ton of bricks... We have debts of 60,000 francs... And I'm not talking about the 600,000 needed for you to marry Clotilde... That's not all...come... You see that man there? He's the most stubborn of mules... Monsieur de Granville... state prosecutor... The police? So he knows? They suspect... This imbecile could smell the convict dressed as a priest. We're done for! No... If you obey me like you need to obey me! Don't look back any more... or your fortune and our salvation are gone. And Esther? I'll tell you where she is... You'll see her this evening... She risks nothing because you love her. Thank you...I'll do as you say. Hey...coachman! Please... You're welcome to share my cab! It'll save you from having to pay for another one to follow me! -Monsieur... -Monsieur Abbot...Up you go... Besides...we're going the same way... Coachman...to the Palais de Justice! You overwhelm me with reports about Abbot Carlos Herrera... in whom you make out that you recognise Vautrin. I'm not interested in your hunches... I want evidence! Unmask him... or leave me alone! It's not easy, sir... It is very hard. You're paid to be harder... Come in! Agent Contenson is asking to see you. That's one of my men! He's on this case... he must have news! Have him come in. Anything new? Our man? He's here. You brought him in? Bravo! I didn't bring him in... he came himself... And what does he want? Monsieur the Abbot Don Carlos Herrera, Honorary Canon of Toledo Cathedral. and envoy to His Majesty Ferdinand VII... king of Spain... ...solicits the favour of an interview with the Prosecutor General. Very well... Leave him alone with me. You have indicated a desire to see me, Monsieur Abbot... How can I be of service? Monsieur Prosecutor, I'm here to set my soul at rest... ...and you are seriously jeopardizing that. Me?...Please explain yourself. Due to your surrounding my humble person with so much attention... you risk making me commit the sin of Pride... I would be extremely sorry! But I don't understand... What do you want to talk about? This bodyguard you have following me... A man who would be most useful doing general duties... There are so many criminals... Perfect... My only concern has been the protection of your person. But if that doesn't suit you... I have a guardian angel Monsieur Prosecutor... Very well... The chief detective will receive the necessary orders tonight. I was starting to think the police suspected me of something! Nothing surprising in that by the way... It's quite easy to claim you're sent by the Court... Still...take a look at my credentials... I'd feel happier... These are my personal papers. That abbot's a long time in the confessional. Sure is. That prosecutor could get a confession out of a pile of rocks. Thank you for your kindness Monsieur Prosecutor. The least I could do, Monsieur Abbot... 'Pax Domine sit semper nobiscum.' Fresh water! Fresh water! Who wants fresh water? You can see I'm busy. 80, 90... Is that all? It's a real diamond... It's worth 10 times that. So it'll be 10 times easier to pay me...get out! Hullo my boy! Hullo Asia! The others are upstairs... Don't I even get a 'hullo'? Good to see you, Boss... You working for me? Yes, Europe... The good and the bad... I don't like doing everything... Hullo Paccart... What's new? Silky has just finished his time... He's claiming his money... 7,000 francs He's claiming or asking? He'll be paid in two weeks. Sit down. I've found you a job. You'll enter the service of Madame Esther Van Gobseck... Funny name...funny idea... Who's going to look after the shop? Providence... I'm fine with it. You'll a cook over there... - And me? - Chamber maid. - You'll listen at keyholes. -And me? Her coachman. In the neighbourhood they say she's a foreigner without much money. Just enough to live. I'd say she's a miser. That's it. She'll stay at home during the day. Nights...she'll go out in a carriage. Her doctor recommends moonlight. That's right! Nobody visits her except Lucien de Rubempr?... To take her for a walk... or whatever...eh? That's all. Asia will pass on my orders, if necessary... -And be good servants. -Goodbye, Boss. -On Mademoiselle Esther's orders?... -And on mine. What's going on in that head of yours? I don't have a cent to my name. I need 600,000 francs. Good grief! You won't find that on the doorstep! Any ideas? Just one...but a good one. -Baron Nucingen's in love with the kid... -''Nucingen'' ? -You're talking millions! -A real piggy bank ... So? So he'll be the fish. Esther will be the hook. Lucien will eat the result. You go to a lot of trouble for that boy, Jacques... A lot. He reminds me of my unfulfilled ambitions, my squandered youth... I feel he can give me a fresh start... Basically you're a good guy Jacques... A good guy who's been in prison. Florine, you play wonderfully... Herr Schubert is definitely talented! Herr Schubert may have talent... but not our beloved Florine. Go and join your handsome Lucien... Don't make fun of me, Diane... He's so young and handsome! Haven't you had any other lover? ''Any other''?... Don't be rude! That's not something you ask a lady. Now go... -Can you follow suit? -No... -Thanks... Eight points and three honours. I'm out... The gods of whist are against me... Take my place, Rastignac... You clean up! Our friend Lucien follows the proverb... ''Unlucky in cards...'' Your deal. Did you know it's full of thieves at your place? Did they take something of yours? Your presence...your smile... It's unbearable! I have to put up with more than that! Every woman here is in love with you! You saw how Madame Espard was looking at you!? Forget it!... I've certainly forgotten it. You're just saying that to reassure me... You find forgetting too easy! About anything... except you! You are divine... YOU are a demon!... I'm lost before I start... Mademoiselle Clotilde de Grandlieu...! Off you go... Don't keep her waiting! She looks like she's drowning... and looking for something to grab onto. I adore you! -Hullo, Clotilde. -Hullo, my dear. Oh...I have to leave you... see you soon. I'm late, Lucien... Tell me that you've been worried... I certainly have... You are all I worry about! -Have you spoken to your father? -Yes... Unfortunately others have spoken to him, too... Have I been well-trampled into the mud? There was talk of 100,000 francs in debts... ...and that you risk going to prison. Ridiculous slander! Who said that? -Madame d'Espard... -''Madame d'Espard''? You can see how she's looking at us... What have you done to that woman? She hates you... Since I stopped loving her... A gentleman doesn't talk about such things! You can get our confidence back... Buy the Rubempr? lands... and forget all the others! Clotilde de Grandlieu's husband shouldn't have enemies. Monsieur de Rastignac! Hop in please...I have things to discuss with you... What do you want with me? How is dear Baron Nucingen getting along? How long have you been interested in HIM? And I could ask you...how long have you been interested in HIS WIFE? The baron is in a bad way... He doesn't sleep...he doesn't eat... he's neglecting his affairs. In short...he's in love. -You can guess all the rest. -All of it! I can even guess that fat fool will find the beautiful Esther. He'd pay a fortune to find where she's hidden. But we can hope for the best, my friend... Hope for the best. -Anyway...where can I drop you? -My place. Coachman...7 Rue d'Artois! Good morning... I was told I'd find a certain Madame de Saint-Est?ve here. That's me, Baron. So you know me? I know all the rich of Paris... That's my business. So...it seems you may be interested in our pretty girl...Esther? Where is she? Monsieur de Rastignac assured me... Calm down!... Between what Rastignac told you and what I can tell you... ...there is a gap, dear old chap! A gap of 50,000 francs... Now let's see how you jump over it... You want money? Of course! I want my money... The money I loaned towards securing your passion... -YOU loaned her 50,000? -No, no, no... 25,000... 25 of 50...of course. You'd understand that... being a banker. Alright...50,000. I'll give you a note on my bank. Don't forget the silverware... while you are at it. What silverware?... I have to pay for silverware!? It was needed... by the beautiful one... I sold it to her. The heart of a 20 year old can be a little bit mischievous! It likes to show off! How much including the silver? 80,000, in round figures... I am too great a lady to be bothered with small change... And when I hand over 80,000... I'll get to see her? Not yet... - Because of the curtains... - What curtains?! Hers... Curtains she chose herself... They're beautiful! You'll see! Add 20,000... and she's in your arms! But that makes 100,000 all up... It's robbery! Will she love me, at least? You aren't good-looking...you're a bit fat... you're a bit of a goose... ...but you're rich enough to buy some semblance of love. Thank you, pet... if you'll just follow me... There... But where is she? He'll tell you, Baron... Who are you? Your confidant... ...and coachman to the one of interest to you, sir. Are you going to show her to me?! This very night... -''This very night''? -This very night... Here... That's for you my boy... Thank you, Baron... ...but I already make a decent living. You're an honest man... Congratulations! I get 1,000 francs a year... it's a good job... I'd be happy to risk losing it to make you happy... ...but it'd take 50 years to make up for it. If you work it out... Work out what? 50 years at 1,000 francs a year... ...makes 50,000 francs. You'd understand, Baron... 50,000 francs! This is a swindle! I've already been relieved of 100,000 francs for a girl... That's dear enough!... You'd be the better judge of that, Baron. And what if your mistress refuses to receive me? Mademoiselle is much too honest not to recognise your merits, sir. Tonight could be a beautiful night... if you were willing to trust me, sir. Tonight? So be it...I'll pay! Where will I see her? At midnight...at a place called "Three Ways" in the Fausses-Reposes woods. You'll soon see if I'm lying, Baron. Give me a pen. - Mademoiselle? - Is that Lucien? Lucien won't be coming this evening. Why not? Has something happened to him? Yes, an order... The advice I gave him... A trial separation seemed necessary to me. And he accepted it? With difficulty... you'll be glad to hear... He even said nasty things to me... ...though flattering for you. What harm are you planning for us now? Why would I want to harm him? You're mistaken... I love him as much as you do. lmpossible!... I'd give my life for him! The beautiful affair that makes life worth living!... Better to show him how intelligent you are...and make him happy. I am his happiness... and he's mine!... That's all we ask for. You really are all woman... You don't see further than your bed... That will help him to a great career. I decided he'd be my masterpiece. And if that should lead to my death? It's astonishing...the mania women have about wanting to die! It'd be easier than living without him. Be reasonable. He needs both of us. -Lucien is in a most serious situation! -Really?! Would you like to help me save him? What a question! So just sign these papers. IOUs? What's it all about? That you owe 150,000 francs to Baron de Paccart... To my coachman? I've made you coachman a baron. So, sign!... Sign!... Paccart must obtain a judgment against you... -But who's going to pay? -Love! That love that has inspired Baron de Nucingen. Nucingen?...who's that? -Eh!? - Who's that? The least noble, but the richest gentleman in Paris. I don't know the man at all. That won't deter him. But you'll get acquainted in 2 or 3 days... -He dreams of ruining himself for you... -What? I won't do it! You have to! It's the only way of saving Lucien from prison... I'll save him. I was thinking that my darling had a fatal illness... It's essential he knows nothing about this. It would be the same as shooting him in the head. Good night. -What's the time, Georges ? -Midnight, sir. But I don't see anybody. A midnight rendezvous... deep in the woods!... I must be completely mad! Maybe she'll never come. You shouldn't linger around here. Shut up! I see that you have trusted me, Baron! If you'd like to follow me Baron... And what do see there, Baron? Oh, my God! She's wonderful! Let me go to her! -Are you joking, Baron? -Of course not! I want to talk to her! -That's not possible, Baron -How dare you! In the best interests of yourself, Baron... Mademoiselle would not allow a stranger to pounce on her. -It needs time... -''TIME'' ! You thief! You promised me... that this would be a beautiful night. Haven't you been able to see the woman you love, Baron? You can't catch butterflies by firing a pistol. If you could be patient for three days... ...you'll be received in a bedroom. -In HER bedroom? -In 3 days. You'll receive a confirmation note. Three days... Through here...Baron, sir... Gosh!...Nice apartment!... Your mistress has better lodgings than my wife! Every jewel has to have its case... Everything here is chosen to serve the beauty of Mademoiselle... The marbles...the silver... the curtains... -I know! I know!...You're telling me! Where's your mistress? Has she been told about me? At length, Baron. More than once... But she doesn't want to listen... But I highlighted your merits... your fortune... I'm the biggest banker in Paris! ''The biggest'', yes... That's what upsets her... She doesn't like big and fat... In the end, she's let me decide ...if you might please her or not. So... What have you decided? You see me hesitating... If I make a mistake...I lose my job... A job worth 1000 francs a year... It would take me 10 years to match it... So you too!? You're all thieves! This is blackmail! I refuse to pay... That's a pity... There's the door that'll bring you within a hair's breadth of happiness. So be it...10,000 you said. 20 000, Baron... 10,000 for my job... 10,000 for my conscience. You rogue! The Baron de Nucingen! Mademoiselle...you see before you the happiest of men approaching you! Yet most miserable... because he sees you crying... Don't let my tears upset you... They're not because of you... neither can you make them go... You are unhappy, though? Allow me a place in your life... I'll make you the most envied woman in Paris! Come... Come and sit next to me! There... I love you, Esther. Can one be in love with something one buys? I only pay your debts... Do you have others? I'll pay them, too! All I ask is one thing... let me be close to you. Sounds like fun, Baron... but I think you're jumping the gun! Should you get to crumple my dress after just 5 minutes of wooing? Let's drink to your health... Everything in good time! You are charming my child! Your ''child''? I'd like to be...but then you must love me like a father! Though not really like a father! Come on now... drink...drink up! Come and sit next to me! Soon... To the loves of Baron de Nucingen! Yes, old girl...I'm nervous! I'm gambling everything on this. The cards are marked... and your opponents are blind! Fortunately! Tomorrow you'll go to the bank to cash the Baron's note. If our girl knows how to play her role... Lucien will marry Clotilde. I'll send an announcement to that idiot agent Contenson. - So...? -All going well, boss... Grandpa is in Mademoiselle's bedroom... Love made him so stupid... I took him for 20,000. He's got so much... He'll hardly notice it. This time I've got you! I've got you!... You terror of a girl!... What a nasty man... who won't drink my health!... I feel... I feel... I feel sick... Don't leave me... my treasure... Don't leave me... my little heart-throb... Easy...easy now... Rest for a while... close your eyes... You've got all night ahead of you! You go and keep him amused. Is that how we hang onto a good catch that pays our debts? Shut up! You are not good at doing this... and you're too full of yourself... We find a millionaire... and you turn up your nose... Get out! Through here, gentlemen... What's this about? Are you Esther Gobseck? -Yes...but... -Officer Dherville... ...bailiff of the Paris court... ...acting on a judgement obtained against you... ...by Baron Paccart... to whom you owe 150,000 francs. I'm here to seize your furniture. My furniture? Do you recognize these documents? Is that not your signature ? Yes, but... Are you able to pay? No... Get to it!... Following complaint be Baron Paccart... I'm arresting you for default of payment... What are you people doing here? They're here to seize the furniture... and throw her in the debtor's prison! Please save her, Baron! What...even more debts? Show me the details. Yes... That seems to be in order... Do you know who I am? Do you wish to pay it perhaps ? 150,000 francs. One could argue... the devil...!... It's either paid... or justice takes its course... Mademoiselle... This man is going to let you go to prison for 150,000 francs! Take my savings! Shut up you little slut! I know where 20,000 francs of your savings come from! I'll pay. -We only accept payment in cash... -That's right... I am Baron de Nucingen! Well...that changes everything! Your signature will suffice, Baron! Thank you, Baron! Everybody out!... Through here, gentlemen! Here we go, my treasure! Cheer up... You've been extravagant... Like all pretty women... Go away! You can't mean it! You've already cost me more than 300 000 francs! Be reasonable, my treasure! Let me go, I say! Let you go...let you go!... I've been doing that for 4 days! Now I'm going to get what I paid for! You brute! You whore! Filthy thief! Isn't that it?... I cough up 320,000 francs in return for a slap? Well...that's not on! You'll soon be getting a bit of news from Baron Nucingen! Good work, my child! Congratulations! If that oaf gets too angry... Lucien is lost! He'll go straight to prison. It was beyond me... I couldn't... I couldn't... I'll never be able to... Phooey!... So this great love has only served to speed up his demise! Bravo! I love Lucien and you're asking me to love somebody else... Show me the woman who would submit to that! Probably none.... Too bad...But he's young enough to endure a few years in prison... No...not him! I couldn't bear it! So? His life or death simply depend on a gesture from you, Esther! Tell me what I have to do... I shall have to find the strength not to defend myself from him. Write a nice not to the baron... he'll come back.... He's the sort that easily forgets a slap. That will be the end of my love. You deserve to be happy... but life is cruel, my pet. I ask you one last effort for 300,000 francs. After that...you can slap every baron on the planet. Cheer up!... We've got 320,000 francs!... Half your marquis estate... Where did the money come from? What you don't know won't hurt you. Yes? Excuse me Marquis... there's a man wishing to see you. Does he have a name? He said that was irrelevant... But he insists. -Damn him...I'm in a hurry. -No...show him in. If he hides his name, he may have something of interest. You want something? Yes, Marquis... 100,000 francs. That's a lot of money. And on what basis, may I ask? On the basis of discretion. I presume it's yours you're selling...you sneak? Only to connoisseurs, Marquis! I wonder at which key hole our dear abbot has his ear... but it doesn't really matter. Let's talk business... You're counting on marrying Mademoiselle de Grandlieu... ...once you come up with 600,000 francs... Miscalculation. - You'll need 100,000 more. - Otherwise?... Otherwise I talk. I tell the duke what I know... ...and I know sufficient... ...to put him right off any marquis of your type. There are two possibilities... ...either you know nothing and I give you nothing... ...or you know something... and if I give you money... you blackmail me forever. The young often speak without thinking... So think about it, Marquis... I'll walk down the stairs slowly... You may decide to call me back before I reach the street door. Certainly not! In that case...you're lost... Monsieur de Rubempr?. -Well? -You heard him? This man will betray us! No...I don't think so. Why give away information he still hopes to sell? We have to get ahead of him. Get over to Grandlieu's and make your request as soon as tonight ... Madame de S?risy is expecting me at the opera. You can join her later... And when can I see Esther again? Why do I have to be separated from her? Where is she? That girl doesn't matter to me just now... When the fire's in the castle... you don't worry about the stables. -Well? -I'm sorry...no one is here. -What!?...What do you mean? -There's no one here. Are you mad? I repeat...sir... there is nobody here. There is nobody here to receive the Marquis de Rubempr?. Lucien? Lucien! -Clotilde!...what's going on? -Come with me! My father gave orders that you aren't to be admitted. Why? A policeman came to talk to him. Contenson! He spoke very badly about you... He said your money comes from your mistress's bedroom activities... The wretch! And you father believed it? As for me...I believe in you... I know you're a decent man! Clear yourself of these slanders... I beg of you! -You'll do it...won't you? -I swear My father wants me to leave Paris for a few days... I'll obey...but not before I've seen you again. Be at the entrance to Fontainebleau forest tomorrow morning at 8... at the Belecroix crossroads... You know it? But now you must leave... Go quickly! -'Til tomorrow, Clotilde! -'Til tomorrow! Esther... Esther, my treasure... look at me... -Why are you so mean? -Me?...Mean?... Come now!...I'm taking care of you... Because of indigestion... one shouldn't court a woman right after a meal. Aren't I kind to you?... I've paid all your debts... Don't I wear your livery? We are the perfect couple. The whore and the thief... fit very well together. I've been waiting for you for half an hour... I had things to do. You're rather uncouth this evening... Punctuality is not only the courtesy of kings... What are you up to... are you crazy? But you wrote me to come back... With 300,000 francs. Where is it? If I get it for you... ...what would you do for me in return? -You know what I'm talking about? -Yes. So...fair exchange? Yes I'll send instructions to my cashier. I have just one word to say to you... -Goodbye! -'Goodbye''? I'm leaving you to your new conquest. Congratulations!... He's what you need. You don't deserve anything else!... You're nothing but a whore! -Lucien!...quiet down... -You can't deny it! I saw him look at you... I saw you smile! Am I lying? Do you belong to him? Lucien...you're destroying things for yourself!... I'm totally destroyed anyway! Esther...my treasure! You're crying? -Why? -It's nothing. Come on!... let's get out of here... Go on...give us a smile!... Who's upsetting you? If it's a woman... she'll be dying of jealousy... If it's a man...I'll throw so much wealth in between you... that you'll forget him. I don't want to forget him. That would be like losing him again. Ah! That'll be my cashier... You've finally learned how to talk to women, Baron! Shut up you slut! -Thank you for that... -At your service, sir. This way, sir... See you again soon... I hope! Esther...this money is yours! I kept my word! It's a deal, then... In 10 minutes... come into my bedroom... Allow me this last delay... it's to make myself beautiful. Come in... What do you want? Softly...softly... Your marquis is here... He wants to see you. I know what it's like in love... But be quick! Why have you come? I wanted to see you. Tell me that I've been wrong... that I've been unjust...cruel... Tell me that it isn't true. It isn't true! Esther! Now you must go. Don't ask me any questions. Tomorrow, I'll be free... and nothing will be able to touch me. Go, my angel...go! Until tomorrow, my love! Yes... Tomorrow... Esther ? Esther ! Help! Look... What is it? Dead! ''Dead''? My 300,000 francs! Where are my... Where are my 300,000 francs? My money's been stolen... My money's been stolen! My money's been stolen! Thief!...Murder! Softly, Baron... we don't want a scandal! Calm down... you need to stop and think! I want my money! This could go badly for us. Let me go...you witch! I want my money!... I have to get my 300 000 francs back! Calm down!... we'll get you back your money. Time to scram! My 300,000 francs! Save yourself... we're all done for! The police are here. Why? -What happened? The kid killed herself... I wasn't expecting that. Save yourself...there's a body... they'll get you! Paccart and Europe have run off like rats! The scum! Open in the name of the king! Don't move or I'll shoot! Forgive them Lord... for they know not what they do. Thanks for stopping... What would you expect? I have company... let's not stay here. I swear to be nothing but your wife... I'm more prepared to believe YOU than my father... He has sworn to me that you're a dishonest man. You're a better person than I am, Clotilde... Maybe I love you more when you don't love ME. But now I must go back! Never fear! What's the matter? You must be Lucien Chardon? -Yes...Why? -I'm arresting you in the name of the king! Open the window a bit... it's stuffy in here.... Yes? Here already, Monsieur Camusot ? Something came... Leave us please, Am?lie... ...something extraordinary! Really? I'm in a lather of excitement. This Vautrin-Rubempr? affair will make our fortune... I'm lucky to have been in charge... -Guess what turned up? -Tell me. Madame Maufrigneuse has asked me to come to her place this morning... He's interested in our methods. -Do you know who she is? -A duchess. Beside the point...Importantly, she's a friend of Madame de S?risy... Do you know who Madame de S?risy is? A countess. You don't understand anything. Madame de S?risy is a cousin of the Attorney General!... who's responsible for my promotion. Understand now? Better yet, dear husband... I'm finding out about you. A taste for intrigue may come late, but is no less for that. You can work twice as hard. I do believe I will, my dear... I really do. -Excuse me, madame... -Just a moment, Am?lie... Monsieur de Granville... Don't expect anything from the duchess!... ...and test the wind carefully... ...with intelligence and tact... I'd hate to finish up still a magistrate's wife. Rest assured my dear... The opportunity is too good. -What is it? -A coach is waiting for you Madame... The Countess d'Espard has sent it... She wants you to drop everything and come over to her place. Madame d'Espard?! Hurry!... My linen jacket, my gray dress! Madame d'Espard is the intimate friend of the Minister of Justice. Quick...hurry up! This time... the Camusot fortune IS made! In here, sir... Ah, it's you! -As you requested, Madame... -Come closer Monsieur Camusot... It's regarding a small matter. An order was made to arrest Monsieur de Rubempr?... You were in charge of that matter? Yes, Madame... He must be the victim of a misunderstanding... I guarantee his innocence... He should be released within 24 hours. But...Madame...! I am faithful to those who serve me...Monsieur Camusot... I think you'd make a charming Counsellor to the Court... What do you think about that? Goodness gracious! Madame... That is also the opinion of Madame de S?risy... The Attorney General would soon come around to our views. He likes magistrates who are quick thinkers. -Au revoir, Monsieur Camusot. -My respects, Madame. Camusot ! What are you doing here? I've just come from Madame d'Espard, the friend of the Minister of Justice. She used to be... If you send de Rubempr? to prison or the gallows... you'll become Counsellor to the Court... and I'll be able to have the gas installed at our place. Now we're between two lines of fire... The Minister of Justice on one side... and the Attorney General on the other! The A.G. wants to save him? That was what was made clear to me! My goodness... what are you going to do? My duty...a desperate solution... but the only one left to me. So which way does your duty take you? You have about as much spirit pile of bricks! Leave me alone my dear... and good night! Magistrate Camusot awaits you for questioning. Father!... YOU...in the hands of justice! It's sacrilege! The errors of men are temporary. Have no fear! At least bless me Father! Go now!...do not be afraid... God will recognize his own. -Here's the accused. -Perfect! Come forward! You have been arrested... on charges of fraud with respect to Baron Nucingen... and concerning the murder of Mademoiselle Esther Gobseck. First question... Who...are...you?! The Abbot Carlos Herrera, sir... Honorary Canon of Toledo and secret envoy to Ferdinand VII. At least, that is what you claim to be! It is always possible to get false papers. I suppose one has to accept the opinion of a magistrate. No sarcastic remarks, thank you! I have reason to believe you are Jacques Collin... known as Vautrin...a convict who escaped from Rochefort. Well? Me, Magistrate? A convict!? May God forgive you for such a mistake! Stop grieving, we'll get Lucien out of this mess... He's got enough connections to get out! Him!...in prison! Oh God...I'm so miserable! We need to know what happened to our letters... I've written to him in the past... You've been writing to him. Clotilde would have, too. Pretty scandalous if the police sniff them out. What is it? A woman who insists on seeing you... She has news of Monsieur de Rubempr?... Show her in. Very well, madame. Have you been with him? Have you seen him? Who are you, anyhow? A friend...a casual acquaintance. This business may end badly both for him and for you... Meaning?... Meaning!?...meaning... ...the police will search his papers... That may be inconvenient... particularly for a duchess! Monsieur Camusot's interrogation could have him charged... Something must be done... or he'll be up in the criminal court! ''The criminal court'' ? Dear God! There's not a minute to lose!... Pull yourself together, madame! Why did you try to run away when Contenson turned up? An innocent man doesn't fear the police. Proof... So explain how come you were found in the residence of a courtesan! Well?... Strange place for an abbot! Why should that be?... There was a soul to be saved. Come in! I found a witness... He knew this man previously. Thank you Inspector. -Baron de Rastignac. -Come in, sir. How can I help you, Magistrate. Do you know this man? Certainly... Clerk...make note! Who is he? The Abbot Carlos Herrera... there's no doubt about it! How are you my dear Abbot? -Do you need me anymore? -No, you may go. This is unconscionable. I insist that this is the convict Vautrin! I give you my word on that! So what am I supposed to do about it?! You're Chief of Security... maybe you can be a witness. Then I demand the "brand test". Go ahead! Did you hear that? Do what's required. Remove your coat and take off your shirt! Do you understand? Not at all sir... Please forgive me... I'm accustomed to monastery rules... not those of prison... Every convict is branded on entering the prison... These scars are indelible... Drawing blood to the skin makes them appear... So we'll see. Do it! This is the final humiliation. Might I say, Magistrate... that you have a strange method of treating diplomatic envoys. There...look...that's the mark! I can't make out anything in that mass of scars... The scars have nothing to do with a prison brand. Where do they come from? I took the word of God to the Indians of North America... They whipped me until I bled. You looked for a scar... I have the glory and the regret to have had several to show you. Are you satisfied? Reverend...I face the facts... and I apologize. The police reports were wrong about you... To err is human. You will be free tomorrow... We'll fix the dismissal of the charges... and to prepare your discharge. I hope you won't hold too much against me! Your mission is to punish... mine is to forgive. I leave the task to God of judging the judge. Ladies... Tell the prosecutor we're here... and make be quick about it! Why have I been arrested?... What am I supposed to have done? Monsieur de Rubempr?, you are here under two charges... ...of theft and of murder... -Me?! of one Esther Gobseck... your mistress. Dead? Esther is dead? Poisoned. As there is no reason to consider suicide... we are obliged to regard it as murder... and to find the culprit. Police officer Contenson... who had been watching you... has seen you enter this woman's home... around the time of the murder. The same evening, you had a violent argument with her at the Opera. She was in the company of Baron de Nucingen... who was widely known to be keeping her. So...extract yourself from all that if you are able. You must be mad!... Me!...do anything at all to Esther?! Why? I was in love with her! She was all I loved. One can very well kill for love... You wouldn't be the first. You've been living in grand style these last months...Monsieur de Rubempr?! No doubt your expenses... exhausted the generosity of Mademoiselle Esther... Her change of heart was not to your liking. So... What are you saying!? You're lying! Where have you been getting all your money? You don't have any personal fortune. Well? See who it is! Where do you think you're going? I had to see you right away! I've just come from Poitiers where I arrested Esther's coachman. Who ordered that? The Attorney General... Monsieur de Granville. Oh? Well...good...So? I've retrieved Baron de Nucingen's 300,000 francs... and also found this letter... Read it. It proves the innocence of Monsieur de Rubempr?...absolutely. [Esther's suicide note to Lucien] You may go, Contenson. Monsieur... I owe you an apology... i thought you were guilty.. and you were only a victim...read it. Forgive me, my love... And I dared to accuse her! It was undoubtedly a fashionable error! The other one did everything... Did you read it? He's the guilty one! -The abbot Herrera ? ''Abbot''?...come off it!... Do abbots murder? He's no more than a runaway convict... What are you saying? Wait there a moment!... Write! Write it down...you idiot! Then you assert that the abbot Carlos Herrera... Is none other than the convict Vautrin... who escaped from Rochefort prison? I'm giving him up to you... because Esther must be revenged! Then you can do nothing? Nothing...absolutely nothing my dear cousin. Camusot is totally in charge of this affair... All we can do is rely on his intelligence. But Lucien is innocent! Such an attractive boy in prison... there's no justice anymore! When I think of some petty constable reading our letters! I gave orders accordingly... I hope they've been carried out. Yes? -Monsieur Camusot wants to see you. -Show him in. My apologies sir... -I'm disturbing you... -Not at all my friend! Where are we up to in our affair? Victory, sir... Victory in every respect. I have just exposed the most famous criminal of our time! Here is the statement signed by Rubempr?. Vautrin is ours! You're right, madame... De Rubempr? isn't guilty of either theft or murder... ...but he has confessed to a crime even bigger than those. Which crime? He acknowledged that an escapee was his mentor and companion. In this account his innocence is no help. Vautrin will face the criminal court... and de Rubempr? will be shown to have been the friend of this man. Isn't that so, Monsieur Camusot? Never!...I'd rather die than see that man!... shown to be a convict's friend. I shall make myself heard by His Majesty! The king hasn't the slightest power over the most stupid of magistrates... That's the greatness of our liberal institutions... For Monsieur Camusot it's just a matter of conscience. So you'll just have to try to fall in with Monsieur Camusot's conscience. Your masterpiece my friend! Well done! I hope the prosecutor doesn't commit the folly... of parting with such a clever magistrate as yourself! Am I to understand that here is where I shall spend my life? You suddenly catch on very quickly... Why did you leave it so late? Show me this stupid document... Is this your only proof? The only one. The only copy. -Perfect! -Stop...you haven't the right! I protest...I order you... Oh, you... You've assaulted a magistrate! Other magistrates would have loved it! It's a crime against justice!... I shall complain!... Come...come...take it easy! These cries are not worthy of a Counsellor to the Court! ''Counsellor to the Court!...'' As soon as a position becomes vacant of course. Madame...really!... Anything new, ladies? I think everything's worked out for the best. The abbot Carlos Herrera has been the victim of a judicial error. Monsieur Camusot has fixed it with his usual finesse. I congratulate you in resisting outside influence... and only obeyed your own good sense! You will be a great magistrate. There's nothing to stop me seeing Lucien now! Of course!... Bring him into my office. Camusot...help him. Monsieur...you are a criminal. You escaped our justice... but will not escape that of God! You will receive your punishment and I pity you...it will be terrible! Prison? Hell!... de Rubempr? is dead. Lucien? Dead?...It can't be true! How? Who killed him? You did... He hanged himself in his cell because his mistress was dead... and her death was all your fault. Might I get some gesture of pity from you? You'll see it... We'll take you to him... Thanks for thinking of it. Would you excuse me please, Duchess... but it looks as though the Countess is getting her colour back! You're right... L?ontine, my dear... Lucien...my poor love! You may go...thanks! Cry your eyes out!...it's the best way of washing your grief away. Well? She won't die from grief. She looks pretty when she's suffering. Any news about our letters? The searches have yielded nothing. They've probably been hidden... A tough character, this Vautrin... With these letters signed by L?ontine, Clotilde et Diane... he's more powerful locked in his cell than you and the police. If ever those wretched letters ceased to be a secret... There's nothing like the wind of scandal to ruffle the hair of kings... You can take him. Let's not beat about the bush... you have a trump card... You have letters from three of the grand dames of the kingdom... Cards on the table... what do you want in exchange? Nothing...Monsieur Attorney General... I'd been counting on the letters as my ultimate defence... but now there's nothing to defend. Your freedom perhaps? What good would that do me? You'll have those letters within the hour... Do what you want with me. What gave you the idea I'm generous? No matter...For 20 years, I've seen another side to the world... it's lower depths...it's cellars... Because I despised it, I thought that it was right, for those smart enough, to take from it... But no...Above all of us, there is still something... -Providence... -Yes. Providence has come down on me in one fell swoop. But even in prison...I can be free. You are a free man. You might even make a useful man... if you show the inclination. The throne is trembling on its foundations. It's better to have at its service the abilities of an adventurer... than the conscience of an imbecile. You'll find out that doing good is not as easy as doing evil... and if you are willing to be put in the service of His majesty... the liberty which I grant in his name...is yours. On your way, Monsieur. Subtitles by FatPlank [RLB] for KG
