(gentle music) - I was born in 1928, the youngest of seven. My mom and dad came from eastern Europe to Manchester, England at the turn of the century. My mother was a very passionate Zionist. I remember chatting with my mom about things going on in Palestine, always nice things, always children, summer, bronzed, always carefully. And one day, I was introduced to a religious Zionist. He was a movement called the Bnei Akiva. They communicated to us. I had a magnificent dream of a paradise awaiting us, if only we would leave this background of Manchester to the new future of the home Israel, of Palestine, where we were going to build Utopia. So I would daydream, thinking of myself out there in Galilee or somewhere, a rifle over my shoulder pushing a plow, thinking as I stare at sunsets on yonder horizon, I was determined to get there. And then a small miracle fell into my lap. I actually got a scholarship to go to Palestine. In November 1947, I found myself at the railway station in Manchester bidding farewell to a lovely family, a most lovely family. Sitting on the train and hearing the most exciting sounds that a young fellow can ever hear, and that's the puff, puff, puff of the train leaving the station into the unknown, but the unknown was so exciting. I never could have imagined as that young boy of 17 where that unknown was going to take me over the next four decades, that I would not only witness but also participate in some of the greatest events not just of Israel's history but which also impacted the world's history as well. (dramatic music) (explosion booming) At the end of 1947, the ground in Jerusalem was beginning to shake as the United Nations was about to pass a resolution, a partition of the country, between a Jewish state and an Arab state. What had began as demonstrations and riots within weeks after my arrival became the actual bloodiness of the War of Independence. It was in this atmosphere that the students of that group to which I belonged volunteered and we became kind of a diggers brigade. We were digging fortifications because the impending prospect was that five Arab regular armies were going to invade us. May the 14th, 1948, midnight on that Friday the they bid us, the Jew, to leave the territorial waters of Palestine. My bucket brigade, some 25 of us on a location overlooking a cargo. Among our group was a fellow called Leopold Mahler, a violinist, grandfather of the composer Gustav Mahler. He had been leader of the violin section of the Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra. World War II, Final Solution, Auschwitz, that's where he ended up. And there he played, he went to the Auschwitz Orchestra. This is where he would also keep his violin, in the death camp. And wherever he went, he took his violin. Everything that he says, it was expressive of melancholy. We, our group were very, very sensitive about Mahler's fingers. Where we were, we had no field intelligence, we had no telephone, we had no radio, we had no idea what was happening. And now, commander to protect Mahler and his fingers. Told him, try and get away to get into town. Bring back information what's happening. There we were in the trenches, some with rifles, some without rifles, waiting for the attack, for the anchor in the midst of all this. Out of the blackness of the sky suddenly appears Mahler. He brought some news. And he says, Ben-Gurion did declare independence. The state is coming into being at midnight. And the British have known all the union Jacks, they've left the country. Mahler, what's the name of our state? Mahler looks with a blank stare. And he says, I don't know, I didn't think to ask. What do you mean, you don't know? So somebody says, you know what? I bet it's gonna be called Yehuda, Judea. King David's kingdom was called Judea. Nah, said another, it'll be called, Zion, Zion, Zionist, so I said maybe they'll call it Israel, Israel. Whatever, who cares, let's drink a (speaking in a foreign language) to our new state. (upbeat music) And we went into town, that's where we found out the name of this place is called Israel. There were tons of people all over the place celebrating. They saw Mahler's violin, so they urged him to take it out. It was almost celestial, and he began first of all to play a very slow motion (speaking in a foreign language). And then gradually, the rhythm began to pick up until everyone, prances into a whole dance, this (speaking in a foreign language). And for the first time, I saw a smile on his face and a glitter in his eye. (gentle music) Returning to Kibbutz Lavi with a wife on the upper suburbia of the Jewish community in London to still the tents and the shacks and the mud and the stones and the locks of Lavi, it didn't last very long. And a year later, we moved to Jerusalem. I'd always enjoyed writing, I'd always enjoyed editing. In 1955 I got a job editing a rather obscure magazine published on behalf of the Jewish Agency. I was lucky to get this job, but it paid in pigeons. I was moon lighting, with whatever other work I could get in translation and composition. And this brought me into the orbit of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. John DeMair was the foreign minister and he had embarked upon a very ambitious program of leap frogging over our immediate Arab neighbors to start the ties of friendship with the African emerging states. And I was moon lighting writing in this propaganda material word into Africa. The head of the department in the foreign ministry, a guy called Eddie Affi, and one day, this must have been about 1958, I got a phone call from him. And he said to me, Yehuda, would you like to come in and join us? And the foreign minister, I said sure I would. Came a day and it was in 1963 when Eddie Affi was appointed as Bureau Chief of the then prime minister, Levi Ashford. You need to come, we need you here in the prime minister's bureau for English speech, writing, note taking, and English correspondence. And that's how I began working in the prime minister's office. (upbeat music) Eshkol was a most affable man, very easygoing boss. He was utterly accessible, he loved Yiddishisms. The first speech I ever wrote for him I put in the words, and yes, we shall be a light unto the nations. And Eshkol, he could peer at you over his spectacles. And when he did that, you knew something was coming, he says. - [Levi Eshkol] Younger man, let's first be a light unto ourselves and then, we'll bother about being a light unto the nations. - I was escorting to his car one day. A policeman called Lui Yankala. He was always the one who opened the prime minister's door. And so Yankala opens the door of the car and Levi Eshkol, prime minister says to him. - [Levi Eshkol] Lui Yankala, how am I doing as your prime minister today? And Mr. Frieden, are you satisfied? - [Lui Yanakal] No, I'm not, my taxes are far too high. You have to bring down, I'm being robbed. - [Levi Eshkol] Yankala, we have to buy weapons for our army to deter our enemies, and that cost a lot of money. And we have to build homes for our refugee immigrants, schools for our children, hospitals for our sick, and factories for employment. And while we develop the economy, the quicker I'll be able to bring your taxes down. So be patient, Yankala, be patient. - Yankala looked at him with a look which says, maybe you will, maybe you won't. And then, he saluted and he closed the door. And I'm standing there, I'm only, what other prime minister in the world asks a question like that of a police officer? And then listen to what he has to say and then answer him, explain to him what he's trying to do. That was not only the nature of the man, it was the nature of our society at the time. One day, a group of about 10, 12 leaders of the various Jewish federations and the United States come to visit him, one of them says to Eshkol, "Mr. Prime Minister, you expect us American Jews "to know every new kibbutz, every new moshav. "But what do Israelis know about us American Jews?" And then he turned to me and he said, "When was the last time, young man, you were in America?" And I looked, I said, "I've never been." "Ah-ha," said the gentleman to the prime minister. "You see, you have a member of your own staff "who doesn't even know what American Jews look like." To which Eshkol said, "So why don't you invite him?" To which he said, "I shall." Now it so happened that that very morning I had put on the prime minister's desk a letter for his signature addressed to the former president Harry Truman. And this letter had been requested by the Hebrew University in Jerusalem who were about to establish what they called an Institute for the Study of Peace. And they wanted it to be named after Harry Truman. And as he signed it, he asked this group, "Will Independence, Missouri be a part of the story "arranging for Yehuda here?" To which the leader of the group said, "Sure, we can do that." Eshkol then said to me, "In that case, Yehuda, "I want you to present this letter personally "to President Truman." - [Levi Eshkol] Mr. President, I cannot think of a better choice than you to bear the name of this important institution. The state of Israel will forever be grateful to you for your moral and courageous decision to assert the power and the prestige of the United States in your support of Israel's founding in 1949. - And I said, they came. I found myself in Independence, Missouri, ringing the doorbell of a Victorian style house. A maid opened the door, took me into a lounge which was full of memorabilia of his whole political life including clearly from his days in the oval office. And there was a piano there. And on the piano was sheet music. And I know a bit about music, so I began studying the notes. It was called the Missouri Waltz. (piano music) - [Harry Truman] I don't give a damn about that waltz, young man, but I can't say that out loud in public because it's the state song of Missouri. - I turn around and there in the doorway is President Harry Truman. He'd already read the letter. The maid had given it to him. - [Harry Truman] Very kind of Prime Minister Eshkol to send you personally to deliver his letter, and kinder still to give me such credit for your nation's independence. But the man he really ought to be thanking is Eddie Jacobson, not me. Dear old Eddie, best friend a man could ever have. We went through some tough times together, World War I and then our haberdashery store, Truman and Jacobson, went bust during the Depression. There was never a sharp word between Eddie and me until one day some time in March '48 he came barging into my Oval Office unannounced. He said he wanted to talk to me about Palestine. Eddie's Zionist friends had been badgering me nonstop, some of them in a very disrespectful way. They wanted me to engage America to stop Arabic tax on the Jews in Palestine, keep the British from destroying the Arabs, deploy American soldiers to do this, that, and the other. The fate of the Jewish victims of Hitlerism was a matter of deep personal concern to me. Hitler's war against the Jews was not just a Jewish problem, it was an American problem. I had been seized of the issue from the day I became president. And now things had reached a point where I wanted to let the whole Palestine petition matter run its course in the United Nations. That's where it belonged. I issued instructions that I didn't wanna see any more Zionist spokesmen so I put off seeing Dr. Chaim Weizmann. He had come to the states especially to see me and Eddie was insistent that I see him right away. Because of that, we had words. I had a statue of Andrew Jackson in my Oval Office. Jackson is my lifelong hero. When Eddie confronted me that day, he waved to the statue and said, "Your hero is Andrew Jackson, I have a hero, too. "He's the greatest Jew alive. "I'm talking about Chaim Weizmann. "He's an old man and he's traveled thousands of miles "to see you and now you're putting him off. "This isn't like you, Harry." And I remember looking back at Eddie standing there and my saying to him, "You bald headed SOB. "You win, I'll see him." Dr. Weizmann and I talked for about an hour. He was a man of remarkable achievements and personality. He put it to me that the choice for his people was between statehood and extermination. It was then I assured him that I would support Jewish statehood. - And with that, I told him that I'm about to go home to my son's bar mitzveh and he instructed his maid to bring me out his two volume memoirs. And he dedicated one volume to me and I said, "Since it's my son's bar mitzveh, "would you mind dedicating the other one to my son?" And he said, "Sure," and then as he escorted me to his door, he said, "Now, how did Eddie used to say congratulations? "Mazel something?" I said, "Tov," he said, "Yeah, that's right, mazel tov." And he shook my hand. (gentle music) Levi Eshkol was a pioneer already in the 1920s in the Jordan Valley, he was a member of the very first kibbutz that was ever established called Deganya. And irrigation became his thing. As he entered into government service, he oversaw the construction of the national water carrier which remains to this day the spine of all our water supplies throughout the country. And if you're looking for the origin origins of the Six Day War that broke out in 1967 that begins with the fact that the Syrians up in the north on the Golan Heights were striving to divert the headwaters of the river Jordan which were the main waters of Pilai of the national water carrier. So if the Syrians were going to succeed, then the country would dry up. (rhythmic drumming) - [Narrator] Trouble and death in the Middle East, a ground and air battle heavily damages Tiberius on the Israeli-Syrian border. Israeli Premier Levi Eshkol inspects the ruins. The fighting erupted quickly when Syrians allegedly fired on Israeli farmers operating tractors. Israel used tanks, mortars, and aircraft to counter attack. Premier Eshkol said, "Friendly foreign powers "will understand the situation." - Nasir then joined Syria in support of this, I can only describe it as the initial act of war. And I can still remember Independence Day of 1967. There was a parade of the Israel Defense Forces taking the prime minister Levi Eshkol. And by his side was his chief of staff, Lieutenant General Yitzhak Rabin. Rabin was handed a note and then he handed the note to Eshkol and that note said that Nasir had just blockaded the straits of Tehran, the maritime route to a certain city Eilat. (dramatic music) Abdul Nasir began to mobilize the whole of the Arab world. Then the rhetoric began to escalate. And what began as threats against Israel ended up with the capital, throw the Jews into the sea. President Johnson is telling us restraint, do not fire the first shot. I am going to put together an International Flotilla that is going to make its way through the straits of Tehran and thereby break the Egyptian blockade. And all the time, Eshkol was restraining his military, insisting that we have to give America a chance to do what Lyndon Johnson said he's going to try and do. But then I remember telling him that we don't have the time. That they are going to attack any minute. And a week went by and two weeks went by and Lyndon Johnson simply couldn't deliver. And the mood in the country became totally demoralized. (gentle music) (speaking in a foreign language) I was in there, when Eshkol's chief diplomatic advisor came in to say that we received a message from President Johnson that we should show self restraint and the Russians have sent us a message that we should beware of firing the first shot. And the prime minister's military secretary added that the Egyptians have introduced poison gas equipment into the Sinai. And we have no gas masks in the country. Well then Eshkol said that our foreign minister Abba Eban is shortly to meet with President Johnson in the White House so I want to speak to him immediately. Now, the relationship between Prime Minister Eshkol and Foreign Minister Eban was not one of total mutual admiration. I remember Eshkol once saying, "Abba Eban never knows to make the right decision, "only the right speech." (Levi speaking in a foreign language) - [Levi Eshkol] Blood will spill like water. (Levi speaking in a foreign language) I must speak to the learned fool. - [Operator] I have Eban on the line, prime minister. - [Levi Eshkol] You hear me, Eban? I'm telling you to remind the president what he promised me, that the United States would stand by us if we were threatened. Tell him this is about to happen with poison gas, too. The question is Israel's existence. (dramatic music) - Abba Eban called on the prime minister at his office and as he walks in, Eshkol says to him, his eyes bright with a beaming smile. (speaking in a foreign language) We have to make a thanksgiving benediction. - [Levi Eshkol] This morning, our air force caught the whole of Egypt's air force by surprise and destroyed practically all of it on the ground. We've taken complete control of the skies and the Gaza Strip and now we're moving deep into Sinai. The Syrian, Iraqi, and Jordanian air forces have tried firing back but we're in the process of destroying them as well. (Abba speaking in a foreign language) - [Abba Eban] Thank God, tell me the Jordanian attack, how serious is it? - [Levi Eshkol] So far just artillery exchanges, mainly in Jerusalem with a few skirmishes around Mount Scopus. I've sent word to King Hussein for the UN and the Americans that if Jordan stays out of the war, we won't touch them. (alarms sounding) - Begin had an enormous sense of Jewish history and now quoting him, well he said to me, he said, "I took myself into a coma and I thought to myself, "this is the opportunity to be able to get back "all our treasures lost to the Jordanians "in the old city in 1948." And he was joined by another minister of labor, Yigal Allon. And he found in Yigal Allon, he found a kindred spirit. And there standing in a room, the two of them sharing the reflections about this great historic opportunity to retrieve the old city. And Eshkol spies him through the half open door and he says. - [Levi Eshkol] No, tell me what you two are hatching. - [Yigal Allon] Jerusalem, Begin and I want the old city of Jerusalem. (Levi speaking in a foreign language) - [Levi Eshkol] That is an interesting idea. (dramatic music) - The Jordanians are pounding away. Jerusalem streets are empty. And then shells begin to fall around the general area of the Knesset. Everybody's ordered into the shelters. One of the lower floors of the Knesset serves as a shelter and there, you've got members of Parliament and you have got senior officials all sitting there on benches and you've got clocks and you've got cleaning women and you've everybody all huddled, bundled together, scores of them in this shelter. And then enters Ben-Gurion from one side and in comes Begin from the other side and they move towards each other and they embrace and there are cheers galore as they see these two old oppositionists, I can tell you that there have been such a moment of unity in the history of the Jewish state as at that moment, as when Menachem was being showed. And then the Six Day War. And Begin all the time was thinking old city, old city. How do we capture them, we have to capture the old city. And Begin runs out and there here comes the prime minister and takes him to a corner and asks for the immediate meeting of a cabinet. And Eshkol agrees and Begin makes a pitch supported by Elon for the immediate occupation of the old city. One person who's not there is minister of defense Dayan. He's out in the field somewhere. And so Eshkol speaks on his behalf. - [Levi Eshkol] Dayan has serious reservations about this. He believes that entering into the old city will involve house to house fighting and that could be costly and there's a chance it will cause damage to the holy places of the other faiths and that will bring the whole world crashing down on our heads. Dayan thinks it would be sufficient simply to surround the old city. It would then fall to us like a ripe fruit. - [Menachem Begin] I disagree, unless and until Jewish feet are deep inside the old city and on the temple mount, Jerusalem will remain forever divided. We have to occupy it physically. - [Simcha Dinitz] Gentlemen, the Jordanian army is all but smashed and our own army's at the city's gates. Our soldiers are almost in sight of the western wall. How can we tell not to reach it? We have in our hands a gift of history. Future generations will never forgive us if we do not seize it. - [Levi Eshkol] Order, please, I've made a decision. In view of the situation created in Jerusalem by King Hussein's refusal to heed our warnings, an opportunity has been created to capture the old city. If it comes to it, I overrule Dayan. - In the meantime, a brigade of the parachuters had been ordered from the south where they had been engaged to come to Jerusalem. Begin was staying at the King David Hotel and couldn't sleep and he kept the radio on all the time. And at the four o'clock broadcast, he heard the news that the Security Council was about to pass a ceasefire resolution. Begin immediately phoned the prime minister. - [Menachem Begin] Forgive me for disturbing your sleep, prime minister, we have no time left. I propose the army be ordered to enter the old city forthwith before it's too late. - Eshkol authorized Begin to contact Vayan to obtain his approval and it was decided that at seven o'clock the following morning there'd be an emergency meeting of the cabinet for the immediate entry into the old city. (dramatic music) The parachute brigade found serious opposition but nothing like the intensity that they had feared from the Jordanian legion who were good fighters. And within a few hours came what in the Israeli folklore is a declaration that has entered the pantheon of Israeli triumph. Those were the words communicated over the radios by Colonel Motegol, the commander of the parachuter's brigade. (speaking in a foreign language) The temple mount is in our hands. (dramatic music) (speaking in a foreign language) - But I'd been instructed meantime to fly to the United Nations to be at hand for Abba Eban, who was then addressing the security council. But I wouldn't leave without first of all seeing the west wall. I knew the chief army spokesman in Jerusalem and through his good offices and military deep took me through the lion's gate. And inside was pandemonium, soldiers of every stripe and of every rank were rushing through the alley ways to see the west wall, just to touch it. And I was privileged to look at it. I couldn't get anywhere near it before I flew off to the UN. (dramatic music) And here it must be stressed, this was the first time since the destruction of the temple in the year 70 AD that one of its major constructions that we made was back in the hands of the Jewish people. (gentle music) Would the old city have been a priority within the confines of the Battle of Jerusalem had it not been for Begin? It was this sense of history and mission, the mission that it inspired and he spelled it out in the cabinet meeting. (gentle music) Well, it was only the historian looking back who saw Levi Eshkol in the perspective of the extraordinary war leader that he really was. As the countdowns began, certain major generals were publicly accusing Eshkol of procrastination, if timidity, of indecisiveness and simply lacking the guts to make the decision to do what was necessary to do. He withstood all these pressures until the exact moment when he knew it was time to go. And by his side was a very important chief of staff, Yitzhak Rabin. And so if you take all this together, the war was more successful than anybody had anticipated. Even in six days, we had the whole if Sinai, we had the whole of the Gaza Strip, we had the whole of the West Bank, we had the whole of the Golan Heights. Levi Eshkol with his Yiddish wit of his, he was going around everywhere doing this. So somebody asked him, "What does this V stand for?" You would expect him to say like, V for victory. And he said, "This is a V." (speaking in a foreign language) How do we get out of all of this? Suddenly we're in charge of larger populations and mass territories. (gentle music) Immediately after the defeat of the Arabs, the Soviet Union began replenishing the Arab arsenals. Those who were in the inner circle here in Israel knew a horrendous truth, that we had virtually exhausted ourselves and having accomplished in a matter of six days this extraordinary victory. We won the Six Day War with French aircraft, particularly standing in Melage. In those days, France was our major supplier. But on the very eve of the war, French President Charles de Gaulle slapped an arms embargo on us. So when the war ended, we had no spare parts. And this is the context in which the prime minister Levi Eshkol decided he must speak to President Johnson. Back in Washington, President Johnson also decided it's time he had a word with Levi Eshkol. And it was at the president's suggestion that instead of meeting in Washington, he invited Levi Eshkol to his ranch in Texas. I get a phone call from Jerusalem to New York instructing me to drop whatever I was doing and put yourself totally at the prime minister's disposal for the course of his visit to the states which began in New York. (speaking in a foreign language) - Should I try to talk Hebrew to you? English. - Mr. Prime Minister, are you seeking military aid from the United States at this time, sir? Are you seeking additional aircraft, Phantom jets as it has been reported, sir? - I wouldn't like to discuss details until after I meet the president and go there. - We flew into San Antonio, Texas. There the president was waiting with virtually the whole of the Jewish community of San Antonio. And then we transferred into the president's private, executive jet. And then we flew to his ranch. When we descended from plane, there was a big car driven by the foreman of the ranch. Lots of howdies as we were introduced to him and so on. And the president said, "I'll take over the wheel now." This beefy guy, he goes charging into his acres. And the acres were vast. So we were bumping around, we came into one pasture. There was a whole herd of cows there. And the president went charging right into them and they scattered, except one. - [Lyndon Johnson] That's Daisy, she's as pig headed as a Texas senator cowlick. (Levi speaking in a foreign language) - [Levi Eshkol] What is the gentile talking about? - [Lyndon Johnson] This is my old homestead, Mr. Prime Minister. This hill country is where my mammy and pappy brought me up. Most of my neighbors are my old playmates. I've known them all my life. - [Levi Eshkol] Very nice, very nice. - Then we came to a cow shed. And we stop at the cow shed and out jumps the president and Eshkol behind him and here you've got this six foot plus Texan. Every stride, muscular authority and our little Levi trying to keep up with his Hamburg hat. So the president and the prime minister walked into the cow shed. There was this cow, she'd just calved. All slivery and leathery, much like feet next to its mom. And something amazing happened. He, Eshkol was an old Kibbutz. It worked in the cow shed as well. So he crouched down to feel the muscles of this calf and the president crouched down with him and they were doing it with intense exchange, discussion between them. And that coalesced a relationship even more. Now we come to the next day when the talks began. The talks took place in the president's den. There were deep leather furniture and over stuffed cushions where you just sat down and then you went down and down and down. The president on a rocking chair up there, up, up, up. And in order to communicate with him you had to sit at the very edge of the couch. I can just see Eshkol now and his team. And the talks began. - [Levi Eshkol] The heart of my mission is how to create peace in the Middle East at a time when the Syrian and Egyptian armies are being rebuilt at a menacing rate under Soviet guidance so fast that the Arab leaders are contemplating renewed war. In a word, Mr. President, we presently do not have the minimum means to defend ourselves. - [Lyndon Johnson] So what are you asking for exactly? Spell it out. - [Levi Eshkol] I'm asking for your F4 Phantom jets. Without those Phantoms, we will be deprived of our minimum security. We need 50 Phantoms as rapidly as possible. - [Lyndon Johnson] 50? - [Levi Eshkol] Within two years, our Arab neighbors will have 900 to 1,000 aircraft. So it's an either or situation. Either the United States provides us with the arms we need or you leave us to our fate. If I leave here empty handed, the Arabs will know that it was not only the French who said no to us, but the Americans, too. Mr. President, Israel is pleading for your help. - [Lyndon Johnson] Planes won't radically change your realities. The big problem is how two and a half million Jews can live in a sea of Arabs. - Then Dean Rusk, his secretary of state spoke, and the essence of his remarks were, however many aircraft we supply, you're never going to be able to catch up to the Arabs and what the Russians are supplying to them. - [Dean Rusk] What kind of Israel do you want the Arabs to live with? What kind of Israel do you want the American people to support? Surely the answer to those questions is not to be found in military hardware. - [Levi Eshkol] These are difficult remarks you're making, Mr. Secretary. All I can say to you now is that our victory blocked the Soviet Union from taking over the Middle East and that surely is an American interest. As for the kind of Israel the Arabs can live with and the American people can support, the only answer I can give you is an Israel whose map will be different from the one on the eve of the Six Day War. - [Dean Rusk] How different? - But Dean Rusk again began pressing this point, the president scribbled a note to him. Dean, go slow on this thing. How do I know? Because when the meeting broke up that note was still on the table and I slipped it into my pocket and I got it to this day. Those words, Dean, go slow on this thing, echoed a sentiment within the president himself. That he was not going to accept blankly the advice of his advisors on the subject. There was something inside him that was whispering that we have to help in some way. - [Lyndon Johnson] I have absolutely no argument with you, Mr. Prime Minister, as to your peace aim and a need to keep Israel secure. And it seems to me that the most useful thing that can be done is for America to reach an agreement with the Soviets to avoid an arms race while at the same time trying to get some kind of peace process going. (Levi speaking in a foreign language) - [Lyndon Johnson] What was that, Mr. Prime Minister? - [Levi Eshkol] Nothing, just a sigh. If only we could get the peace process going. - [Lyndon Johnson] The chances might be slim, but time must be given to try. - [Levi Eshkol] Mr. President, how much time? I would love somebody in the world here in this room to tell me how I can get a peace process going with the Arabs. But instead of peace, we're faced with an Arab rearmament that again threatens our very existence. Mr. President, the state of Israel is the last chance for the Jewish people but I know of only one address to acquire the tools we need to defend ourselves and that address is you. - Eshkol had caught the president's inner ear. And the president came back with a draft of a written statement. The bottom line of it meant, you could see this in Eshkol's eyes, yes, we've understood you, we understand your predicament, and we are going to consider favorably the supply of the F-4 Phantom aircraft. And I can still see Levi Eshkol's face as he rose and the president rose and they shook hands warmly and Eshkol say to him, "Thank you, Mr. President, thank you." And indeed, it was a historic turning point. (dramatic music) Levi Eshkol summoned Lieutenant General Yitzhak Rabin, chief of staff of Israel's defense forces and a hero of the Six Day War to report to him on what had happened in his conversations with the president. - [Levi Eshkol] If the president is true to his word, there could be a new relationship between us and the Americans. It might even be the start of a de facto strategic alliance. - [Yitzhak Rabin] This is why, when I retire from the army, my ambition is to be appointed Israel's next ambassador to Washington. - [Levi Eshkol] You, ambassador? Are you telling me that you're ready to stand around at cocktail parties, sit through boring banquets, and play all those dreary diplomatic games diplomats have to play? Believe me, Yitzhak, you're no diplomat. - He knew who he was talking to because Rabin had no small talk. If he had a sense of humor at all, he rarely showed it. He was shy to a fault. If somebody would say to him, how are you, he was capable of clamping up and considering that an unacceptable intrusion into his privacy. - [Yitzhak Rabin] The reason I want Washington is because strengthening our links with the United States is gonna be our biggest political challenge in the years ahead. Here is an area where I can make a contribution. - [Levi Eshkol] I'll have to think about it and of course, I'll need to discuss this with Abba Eban. As foreign minister, he'll have to approve the appointment. - [Yitzhak Rabin] Oh, I'm sure he'll have reservations. He's not one of my greatest fans and the feeling is mutual. - Abba Eban invited Rabin for a conversation on the subject. And Rabin later told me that the conversation with Abba Eban is invariably a soliloquy where he does the talking and you do the listening. But nevertheless, he got the appointment. I was sitting at my desk with the counselors in New York. I was responsible for political information and dealing with the media when my telephone rings and there is a deep, baritone. (speaking in a foreign language) And here is now this voice asking me to join him in Washington because he said that some embarrassment over the telephone because speaking Hebrew, not his English, left much to be desired. So there I found myself in Washington at the embassy and I asked him, knowing that he'd just arrived, what do you plan to do? What are your goals here in Washington? He stood up, walked to the window, hands in his pockets. Stared out of the window. And talking to space, not to me, said. - [Yitzhak Rabin] My objectives in Washington are one, to ensure that Israel is provided with her defense requirements. Two, coordinate the policies of the United States and of Israel in preparation for possible peace moves. Three, securing American financial support to cover our arms purchases and buttress our economy. And four, ensuring that America employs its deterrent strength to prevent direct Soviet military intervention against Israel in the even of war. - This was a mind that was so analytical, so structured that you would put before him what would seem to be a complexity of issues. And he'd very soon cut right to the bone and say, well, it boils down to this, A, B, C, D, E. I remember he asked me to prepare a talking paper. This essentially was my job, talking papers. And so there I was on that first day, trying to transpose his cryptic Hebrew into a simple English. So by the time I finished, he'd gone home and he'd left instructions I should deliver it to his home. He was in the middle of dinner with two guests who were old pals of Rabin for the night. And that was the first time I set eyes in there, Rabin, strikingly attractive woman. It was all very jolly. And she loved Rabin as well, she was part of this, what they call the (speaking in a foreign language), this crowd, and after the cold formal experience I'd had with him a few hours beforehand in the embassy, this was astonishing. He was a totally different person. I realized I was in the presence of a special breed, the (speaking in a foreign language). The born of the soil of Israel, the lives totally dedicated to the defense of Israel. Teasers, calling each other by the most ridiculous nicknames. All of them had an aversion to collars and ties. And I realized then that this is the one arena in which Rabin can totally relax and be himself. It was literally a very few months after Rabin assumed office as ambassador that he gave instructions to lower the flag over the embassy door to half mast and open the memorial book for visitors to express their condolences at the passing of Prime Minister Levi Eshkol, from a sudden heart attack. Back in Tel Aviv, the central committee of the Mapai Labor Party met to vote for Levi Eshkol's successor. In those days, there were no primaries. The decisions of who would serve as what were made in smoke-filled rooms by the leaders of the various parties. And this is how Golda Meir was chosen as the next prime minister. When a few hundred hands rise all together in support of the motion, she looked around her first wondering who they were voting for. She realized it was her and she put her hands over her face, half bent and she began to cry. And she was later to tell me in one of those very intimate moments, Golda, why did you cry? And she said, "I suddenly realized "the life and death burden of responsibility "that were being thrust on my shoulders." - Mrs. Meir, may I just ask you how you feel today? Just right now, how do you feel? - I feel terrible because I know that I'm may be called upon, of course, parliament decides, take upon myself a very awful responsibility. I'll try with my colleagues in the cabinet to do the best we can. - Thank you very much indeed. (gentle music) - In the Washington scene, Rabin was very, very quickly recognized as not the normal, run of the mill diplomat. The politicalites, actually was curious about him because they knew he had the direct line to the decision makers and Jews, some on the very highest level. After it came to the attention of the senior echelons of the Nixon administration, some extraordinary things happened. On one occasion, Rabin was invited by Dr. Henry Kissinger, who was president Nixon's head of the National Security Council to the White House. Kissinger said to Rabin that President Nixon would like to meet you and shake you by the hand. And there in the room was President Nixon and he says to him, "I know these are difficult times. "I appreciate the problems you're facing "and I understand that you have to safeguard "your national interests. "And I would just like to shake you by the hand "and it's been a pleasure meeting you." And that was it. Eban was livid. Eban complained that Rabin has got no notion of diplomacy in the sense that he recognizes no hierarchy. Rabin is true behaved in a fashion as if he was sharing ministerial responsibility and Golda was not disabusing him of this and neither was Nixon. Because at a previous meeting between Golda and Nixon, they had agreed that the communications between them would be direct facilitated through Kissinger and Rabin and Eban didn't like it. I think Rabin overdid it with respect to Abba Eban. Abba Eban was a patriot, was a man of high culture, he was a scholar of oriental studies. He was an excellent foreign minister as a spokesman of Israel and as a voice of Israel, he was adored by the Jewish communities abroad. He was admired by governments. However, through the earthy, nitty gritty, pan-generation, fighting generation of Israel leadership, he was a square peg in a round hole. - To blockade, after all, is to attempt strangulation and sovereign states are entitled not to have their trade strangled. To understand how the state of Israel felt, one merely has to look around this table and imagine a foreign power, for example, forcibly closing New York or Montreal or Boston or Marseille or Tulum or Copenhagen or Rio or Tokyo or Bombay Harbor. How would your governments react? What would you do? How long, how long would you wait? - He did have a vocabulary that could be rather verbose at times. There was a satire parody of him addressing these United Nations general assembly and there were all the delegates with English dictionaries quickly turning over the pages, trying to find out the words, what the meanings were. But I learned from him a lot. (gentle music) (upbeat music) Rabin's tour of duty as ambassador was remarkable. He had gained entry to every senior level in Washington, DC. He had a reputation second to none and in December of 1972, Newsweek had declared him to be the ambassador of the year. Why did it do so? We were a small embassy. In Washington, 22 NR, a ramshackled building really. But thanks to Rabin, it had enormous prestige. It's like Rabin had returned from Washington in the early part of 1973, having concluded his tour of duty as ambassador. I had returned some six months before that and became Golda Meir's head of the foreign media bureau. While I was in Washington, Golda had promised me a job in the cabinet. And we met, Rabin and I over coffee in a downtown cafe in Jerusalem one day. And he spoke very britly of the fact that she wasn't keeping her promise. It had virtually nothing to do. - [Yitzhak Rabin] Three times, three different party big shots have promised me a cabinet position but nothing has come of any one of them. It seems that if I want to go into politics, I'll have to do it the hard way, doing my own campaigning and not relying on Golda Meir's promises. (gentle music) - Golda Meir exuded a sense of warmth on the one hand and also the classic Jewish grandmother of keeping a very watchful eye on you. Time and again she would reiterate the famous phrase that all Jews are responsible for each other. Her whole life was an expression of it. She was born in Kiev in 1898 and to the family Mabovitch. Her family moved to the United States in the early part of the 20th century. Ended up in Milwaukee of all places. She married very young, a man called Morris Meyerson. From my understanding, he was a sign painter by profession but his whole inner being was that of a poet. He was a lover of the arts. He was happy in Milwaukee, going to constant art galleries and moving in the circles of high culture. And all the time she in Milwaukee was going to these passionate Zionist meetings until the day came in the early 1920s and she's saying, we're going to erets, to the land of Israel. To do what, literally to drain swamps. And to go to kibbutz. And the kibbutz that she chose was an isolated place in the middle of swamps called Merhavia. And she loved it and he hated it. And so while Golda thrived in the rustic, simple life of a pioneer, all that Morris could do was to look at his blistered hands and say to himself, what am I doing here? Golda regretfully said, all right, we'll leave. And she tore herself away from the kibbutz life. She would write lyrical in later years about how the kibbutz of the 1920s were the happiest years of her life. And so they moved to Tel Aviv. Subsequently, they separated. She threw herself, she thrust herself into the political work of the Labor Party. There was Golda Meir rubbing shoulders with the top leadership led by David Ben-Gurion. As one of the very first tasks as she entered into leadership of the Zionist movement was in 1938. In order to deal with the ever expanding flow of refugees from Germany, President Roosevelt convened the World Conference in Arielle, France to decide upon allocating the numbers that each country would accept. And it is one of the badges of shame of human history that with all the high folluting diplomatic vernacular, nobody accepted any of the Jewish refugees. And who was there as an observer on behalf of the Jewish community then in Israel was Golda Meir. On the very eve of independence, desperate situation, Ben-Gurion dispatched to Golda Meir on a very unusual mission to dress herself up as an Arab woman to cross the lines to go to Jordan's capital Amman to meet with the king of Jordan, Abdullah and to negotiate with him that in this war that was impeding with the other Arab states that he should stay out of it. And through Tritel, she received a fair listening from King Abdullah, but when it came to the crunch, he joined in the war. Very few people thought that we were going to survive. It was one thing to declare independence. It's another thing to defend that independence. I mean, how would they have the means to do so? Some of the first things that Ben-Gurion did was to call in Golda and say, Golda, for God's sake, get on a plane and go to America as fast as you can and collect money, we have no money to buy weapons. And so Golda went to America. And she brought back some unbelievable sum like a few million dollars. She was a natural person to ask to go off to countries far and wide. And she developed into an orator in English. She developed a style which was one, simple. But because it was simple it was all the more compelling. She became the face of Israel to hundreds and hundreds of thousands of Jews across the world, not least in the United States. - Israel was created, not for the purpose of winning wars. Israel was created to safeguard the life of the entire Jewish people. Israel was created so that every Jew knows that he can come home when he has to or when he wants to. (audience applauding) And Israel was created for the one purpose that is the greatest of all, and that is the in gathering of our people. (audience applauding) - She proved herself time and again as a person who could bite the bullet and she was a person who could devote us. There were some situations that would have broken lesser people. During her watch, with her declarative insistence for all the world to hear, I will not negotiate with terrorists. Children were being held hostage at a school that had been captured by the terrorists in northern Israel. She wouldn't negotiate with them. There was a time of aircraft, a Belgian aircraft that was hijacked and landed in Ben-Gurion. And she wouldn't negotiate with them. She believed with all her heart that the moment you start surrendering to terrorists, there's no end to it. (dramatic music) In September 1973, there was a trickle of Jews from the Soviet Union that were low down. It was very difficult to get out. The only exit they had was from Russia to Vienna. Then in Vienna there was an old castle called Chennault and that we had rented as a way station, a transit point for such Jews. And there was this day in September when the train, the Russian train, at the very border of Austria was hijacked. (speaking in a foreign language) Hostages were taken and the ultimatum that was given to the Austrian government was, close the Chennault transit camp. Bruno Kreisky, chancellor of Austria, a Jew capitulated on the spot, closed down Chennault, gave the terrorists safe passage to the Vienna airport and off they flew to Libya. Now Golda Meir heard this just before she was about to board a plane to Strasburg where she had been invited to address the council of Europe. Now, protocol required that Golda Meir read from a written speech and it was my task to write the speech. And to my astonishment, disappointment, even horror, Golda invited to the podium carrying her speech, and then in an almost theatrical fashion faces the speech to one side and says. - You will forgive me if I break from protocol and speak in an impromptu fashion. I say this in light of what has occurred in Austria during the last few days. Since the Arab terrorists have failed in their ghastly efforts to wreak havoc in Israel, they have increasingly taken their atrocities against Israel and Jewish targets into Europe. European governments have no alternative but to decide what they're going to do. To each one that upholds the rule of law, I suggest there is only but one answer. No deals with terrorists. What happened in Vienna is that a democratic government came to an agreement with terrorists. In doing so, it brought shame upon itself. Oh, what a victory for terrorism this is. (gentle music) (audience applauding) - They gave her tremendous applause and in the course of it, she slipped a note to her chief aide to the effect that she wants to fly from here to Vienna to confront Bruno Kreisky on the spot. (gentle music) And Bruno Kreisky received her. To the best of my recollection, when she was ushered into the room, he stood up but he didn't shake her hand. Now when you receive a guest, an important guest, you invite cup of tea, a cup of coffee, something, nothing. And she began on a very reasonable note, expressing disappointment. - [Golda Meir] You and I have known each other for a long time and I know that as a Jew, you have never displayed any interest in a Jewish state. - [Bruno Kreisky] That is correct, I have never made any secret of my belief that Zionism is not the solution to whatever problems the Jewish people might face. - [Golda Meir] Which is all the more reason why we are grateful to your government for all that it has done to enable thousands of Jews to transit through Austria from the Soviet Union to Israel. - [Bruno Kreisky] But the Chennault transit camp has been a problem for us for a long time. It has always been an obvious terrorist target. - [Golda Meir] Herr Kreisky, if you close down Chennault, it will never end. Wherever Jews gather in Europe for transit to Israel, they will be held to ransom by terrorist. - [Bruno Kreisky] Mrs. Meir, it is Austria's humanitarian duty to aid refugees from whatever country they come from. But not when it puts Austria at risk. I shall never be responsible for any bloodshed on the soil of Austria. - [Golda Meir] You have opened the door to terrorism, herr chancellor. You have brought renewed shame on Austria. I have just come from the council of Europe. They condemn your act almost to a man. Only the Arab world proclaims you their hero. - [Bruno Kreisky] Well, there is nothing I can do about that. You and I belong to two different worlds. - [Golda Meir] Indeed, we do, Mr. Kreisky. You and I belong to two very, very different worlds. - [Yehuda] Then she got up. And he said to her, "Well, the press is waiting in the next room. "They expect us to give a joint press conference. "So would you like to follow me?" She said, "No, I don't want to stand with you "in a press conference, I'm going home." (dramatic music) We flew back home that night. We arrived in the early hours of the morning and there was the Israel media, a pack of them waiting for us, asking what actually happened and she said. - [Golda Meir] I can sum it all up by telling you he didn't even offer me a glass of water. - Then she huddled with her defense minister, Moshe Dayan. And then she heard for the first time that the Egyptians and the Syrians were mobilizing. (dramatic music) Part of the agreement was that the area on both sides adjacent to the canal would be a separate zone in which no weaponry would be allowed. The ink had not yet dried when the Egyptians with the Soviet advisors pushed forward a vast number of their SAM missiles into this zone of their side of the canal. Which meant that they now had control of the skies for about 10 miles on our side of the canal. And this is precisely what they wanted. That is to create a strategic situation whereby if at any time they wanted to cross the canal and then the fence against us, they would have cleared the skies of Israeli aircraft. This is what happened on Yom Kippur. And our military intelligence has got it all wrong. (audience applauding) Abu Basir, the acknowledged the leader of the Arab world dies. And his successor is Anwar el-Sadat. He was not on our intelligence radar screen. Suddenly, we began to see on our television this tall, gaunt, seemingly humanless man who had a pension for extravagant uniforms. Part of the failure of our military intelligence was this perception that we had of the man and this perception was reinforced by year after year he was threatening to crush the Zionist enemy. And I recall conversations among us senior folk almost laughing at him because every year passed, nothing happened. (upbeat music) But all the time, clearly he was building up his forces. We didn't have great respect for the Egyptian forces. Didn't have great respect for the Syrian forces. But then, we were still in the euphoria of the victory of the Six Day War. This conceit expressed itself in arming both the Egyptian and the Syrian line with a nominal number of young soldiers in the regular army. We had hardly any reserves, we were cocky. (suspenseful music) Instantly, around the country, the mid morning prayers of Yom Kippur reached a certain climax. The recitation of that dirge, who shall live and who shall die. And in the midst of that in the synagogue where I was at the chief warden mounts the podium and bangs his hand and makes an announcement. "Will all those who are members of the military reserves "please leave immediately and directly to your units. "Take with you your uniforms and your weapons." (alarm sounding) And the siren went and there were military chiefs and command cars back and forth. When I say that we were taken by surprise, I can verily say to this day that the nightmare of every defense minister of Israel and every chief of staff of Israel is a recollection of the Yom Kippur move, taken by surprise. (suspenseful music) (speaking in a foreign language) The carnage of those initial few days as a couple hundred tanks were facing a couple of thousand enemy tanks on both fronts, the Egyptians across the canal in force, the Syrians had occupied much of the Golan Heights and now were beginning to descend from the Golan Heights into the road leading to Jaifa. (speaking in a foreign language) This was the most perilous moment in the history of Israel. When Golda Meir prime minister and Moshe Dayan defense minister, they viewed the scene, there was fear if not despair. We now enter the seventh, eighth day of the war as Succoth, the Festival of Tabernacles. Massive armored battles were taking place in Sinai. The Syrian front was beginning to galvanize. Syrian soldiers began to throw away their equipment, their uniforms, and we were now well on the road to Damascus. It was at this point that Golda Meir said she wanted to visit the Syrian front. There we looked out on what had been the battlefield of a couple of days earlier by troops who had finally stopped the Syrian troops, the carnage, the stench of death, the whole deal a terrible, terrible battle was there in front of us in a valley that came to be dubbed the Veil of Tears. The bodies were still lying there. That's what Golda wanted to see with her own eyes. And there, there was a soilistic scene of this old woman who knew absolutely nothing about warfare suddenly becoming a war leader. As she observed the scene, her face became terribly cracky. And then she turned and she saw an amazing sight. It was the Festival of Succoth. About 30 yards away was a troop carrier with a hatch of palm leaves. In other words, it was a mobile Succoth. And standing in that strange Succoth, about a dozen men wearing trechols, praying their backs to her. And she said, "Today, I want to speak to those men." So we approached, they didn't see her, and she just stood there watching. Suddenly they stand up and they freeze. And she greets them. (speaking in a foreign language) And she starts asking who they are. They were reservists, so she found herself speaking to an accountant, to a few lawyers, to a few falafel vendors. Ours was a citizen army and she asked them about the battle, about the casualties. - [Golda Meir] Now is there anyone who would like to ask me something? - [Soldier] I have a question. My father was killed in the war of '48 and we won. My uncle was killed in the war of '56 and we won. My brother lost an arm in the '67 war and we won. Last week, I lost my best friend up here and we're going to win. But is all the sacrifice worthwhile, Golda? What's the use of our sacrifice if we can't win the peace? - [Golda Meir] I weep for your loss just as I grieve for all our dead. And I must tell you, were our sacrifices for ourselves alone then perhaps you would be right. But if our sacrifices are for the sake of the whole Jewish people, then I believe with all my heart that any price is worthwhile. Let me tell you a story. In 1948, I arrived in Moscow as Israel's first ambassador to the Soviet Union. The state of Israel was brand new. Stalinism was at its height. Stalin had proclaimed war against Judaism. He declared Zionism a crime. The first Sabbath after I presented my credentials, my embassy staff joined me for services at the Moscow Great Synagogue. It was practically empty but the news of our arrival in Moscow spread quickly so that when we went a second time, close to 50,000 people were waiting for us, old people and teenagers, even men in officer uniforms of the red army. Despite all of the official threats to stay away from us, Jews had come to demonstrate their kinship with us. Inside the synagogue, people surged around me, stretching out their hands, crying. (speaking in a foreign language) Welcome, Golda. (speaking in a foreign language) Golda, a long life to you. And all I could say over and over again was. (speaking in a foreign language) I thank you for remaining Jews. And some cried back to me. (speaking in a foreign language) We thank the state of Israel. And that is when I knew for sure that our sacrifices are not in vain. - After they returned to the military headquarters in Tel Aviv, Moshe Dayan said to Golda words to the effect that we can't go on like this. - [Moshe Dayan] What we saw from the Golan Heights confirms my fears that still these are going to continue for an extended period and the attrition is enormous. Unless our stores are speedily replenished, we won't be left with sufficient arms to defend ourselves. - [Golda Meir] Are you saying that we'll ultimately have to surrender to the Syrians and the Egyptians for lack of arms? - [Moshe Dayan] What I'm saying is that if our stores are not replenished at a much faster rate, we may well have to pull back to shore for more defensible lines, particularly in Sinai. - [Golda Meir] Moshe, one way or another, I will get you your weapons. Your job is to bring us to victory. Mine is to give you the means to do so. - And Golda said, I have no choice. But we have to persuade Kissinger who is secretary of state and Nixon who is president that they must replenish equipment immediately and if necessary, I'll go myself. And then she said, get me Simcha, which is Simcha Dinitz, who is now our ambassador in Washington. And it was in the middle of the night in Washington and Golda said to him, Simcha, you've got to wake up Kissinger now and tell him that to persuade the president to replenish aircraft, tanks, cannon, whatever. And Dinitz woke up Kissinger. And there began an extraordinary exchange between Kissinger and Richard Nixon was sitting in Key Biscayne, Florida trying to escape Washington because of the Watergate scandal. And we have the record of the telephone exchanges in which you hear Nixon's voice. And you know that man's been drinking. His language is slurred. But nevertheless, his mind remained sharp. They came to a decision, Nixon was the very first to articulate it, that it's simply not a matter between Israel and the Arabs. It's a matter between the United States and the Soviet Union and therefore we can't let Israel go under. And therefore, very quickly, the idea began to gel and the decision was made to mount a massive airlift of equipment to Israel. It was Nixon who said, "Use our Galaxies." And they began landing at Ben-Gurion airport in the course of an hour, nonstop. The Galaxy is the largest cargo aircraft in the world. You can put tanks in there, you can put fighter aircraft in there. And the president at one point says, "What the hell, if we're sending five, let's send 50." And then more than 50. Without a refusal, truly, and not a single European government would give them permission to refuel on their territory. Not a single woman of her perils in the socialist international would agree to any of these American planes landing on their territory for refueling purposes. So eventually, they refueled in the Azores, which really belongs to Portugal but there was an American base there. She considered herself and the Labor Zionist Movement to be part of this grand fraternity of international socialism, not communism, God forbid. But social democrats. She was perplexed to the extent that her most fervent beliefs had been shaken, if not shattered. And that apparently was a breaking point. She picked up the phone to the chairman of the socialist international, Willy Brandt, the chancellor of Germany and she said to him, "Willy, I would like you "to convene an urgent meeting," which he did and it was held in London. Golda made a speech, which in a few sentence paraphrase, friends, we're at the stage of utter desperation. What would have happened if President Nixon had said, I'm sorry, but I have nowhere to land the planes to refuel therefore we can't help you. And that question lay hovering in the air in the hall and the chairman, chancellor Brandt said, "Is there anybody who would like to respond?" Silence. And Golda looked straight ahead and a voice behind her whispered into her ear, "Not one of them "will say a thing because they're all choking on Arab oil." (suspenseful music) - I'm here to discuss with friends the impact of recent events. And the possibilities for joined efforts towards peace. - And Kissinger began a shuttle. Beginning between Jerusalem, this was his first shuttle to bring about separation forces between Israel along the Suez Canal area. And then Damascus, Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Damascus and back again to bring about a separation forces along the Golan Heights. - This is a beginning for a real and lasting peace with all our neighbors and all our borders. And this is a day that we hope that Syrian mothers, Israeli mothers, Syrian young wives, Israeli young wives, children on both sides of the border can go to sleep at night without terror, dreams of who knows. If their dear one is alive today, will he be alive again on the next day. Mr. Secretary, this is really to a very great extent your day. - And very central to the shuttle back and forth was a prisoner exchange. And when he, Kissinger came back to report to Golda that he has completed the agreement on prisoner exchange, Golda showed Kissinger, a token, a very small, kosher blue and white. Israeli prisoners of war in the Egyptian jail. This was a gift that they had sent her. There were moments, moments, no more at this stage of the game where Jew was speaking to Jew. Kissinger and Golda, that was one such moment. Kissinger knew exactly what the tollage was. And he fully appreciated the depth, the Jewish depth of that little item which was a message from our prisoners of war in Egypt to Golda, we are strong, we're okay. And I was there when the very first contact was made in kilometer 101 between the head of the Israeli military intelligence and the head of the Egyptian military intelligence under the United Nations offices. The two principals facing each other and they shake each other's hand. And that handshake was beginning of what matured into an actual peace process. After the 101 Agreement was signed, Nahum Goldmann soon after the Kinesset and his leader in opposition castigated prime minister Golda Meir. - [Henry Kissinger] The question every household in Israel is asking is why was it that between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur you did not mobilize the reserves and move our army forward? What prevented you, madame prime minister, from taking this most elementary of precautionary measures? Why don't you just come out and openly admit to the nation that you made a mistake? - [Yehuda] Golda pretended that she was immersed in her papers sitting at the government bench whilst Rabin was speaking, but every now and again she would look up with utter contempt. - [Yitzhak Rabin] Mrs. Meir, you know full well that a government which fails in a matter so fateful to the life of a nation inevitably loses the trust of the people. So I ask you, by what moral authority do you stay in office have to be responsible for such a misfortune? I am compelled to say to you not as a politician, not as a party member, but as a father and a grandfather that I cannot depend on your government to ensure the future of my children and grandchildren. So with all the respect and the regard I hold for you, I have to say to you, please go now, right now. Go to the president and hand him your resignation. - Rabin, he was speaking for lots of people, for lots of people in Israel. Shortly after that came new elections. And Golda won the election, albeit by a much smaller majority than before. But gradually, the release of soldiers began and the more soldiers that were coming home to their normal jobs, the more the whispering began. The whispering became a grumbling and the grumbling became accusations. Now one man mounted a demonstration in front of the prime minister's office. He just stood there, he was a reservist. And then another reservist stood next to him and then another and then another until the one became 20, then 50, then hundreds just standing there demonstrating against Golda Meir in front of the prime minister's office. And these demonstrators spread to other cities as well. Eventually an inquiry commission was established. It was called the Agranat commission with chief justice Agranat, who was the president of our supreme court. And since its mandate, which had been established by the government related only to the military aspects of the war, the political edge, the Golda Meirs, the Dayans and company, they remained untouched. And this created a surge of anger among our people which reached such a pitch, such a crescendo. There were such demonstrations. Golda resigned, and with her resignation, the whole government resigned. Seeing in retrospect, yes, Yom Kippur began as utter disaster and ended with destroying virtually the enemy forces. Now if you look at Golda through the prism as another war began and how it ended and what political processes that then transpired, the consequence of the war put her script into proper proportion within the totality of that period of history, then I have to say that Golda, yes, looms larger, the pantheon of Israel's great prime ministers. Golda, she set out of office with enormous dignity. She didn't just go in to retirement, that was not Golda. She took up the cordials of one of the greatest humanitarian movements of contemporary Jewish history, namely the struggle for the freedom of Jews in the Soviet Union that want to leave and they wanted to leave in their masses, the Let My People Go movement. I believe the last occasion when the whole of the Jewish people came together in utter consensus and support of another Jewish community that was locked behind the iron wall. And one of the reasons were because they were inspired by Golda Meir. - [Golda Meir] Today, no one hears these two words together, Jewish refugee, there's no Jew in the world that needs to be a refugee. There's no Jew in the world that needs to feel that he is homeless. With tens of thousands of Jews in a year and a half from Russia be out and going anywhere else? What gives a strength to these young men and women? What is it that gives these young people the courage, the audacity to struggle for their right? And their right, they say in one single sentence, we are Jews, there is a Jewish state. We want to be part of our people and part of our country. It is as simple as all that. - [Yehuda] What is her legacy? Her legacy is what she articulated to these soldiers looking at the Veil of Tears, that for the Jewish people, any sacrifice is worthwhile. - [Golda Meir] If a Jew dares to dream a dream, believe him that this may come true. For 2,000 years, our people, the classic refugees of the world, those who are always candidates to be massacred, to be discriminated against, to be second and third and 10th class citizens in all parts of the world, despite that, our people for 2,000 years in exile had the courage to dream a big dream. One day, we will come back to the land from which we were driven twice before. We will there established again our sovereignty. We will work, we will work with our hands to create everything in that country. We will live at peace with our neighbors and at peace with the entire world. (dramatic music)
