It was here to the left of the church. Weird, isn't it? Doesn't it look funny? Not a bit like English, is it? Look, darlings. There's a funny old church. Do you see? Well, there you are. Thank you for the lift. Well, Dolwyn? - One moment. Yes? With reference to what you've just told me, that village is in my circuit. Don't do more harm than you can help. I thought you'd finished preaching for today. Good evening. I take it that's Welsh. Whatever it is, it's no good to me. "Who is this John the Baptist?" Said Salome to Herod. "I want the head of John the Baptist," said Salome. I say it in English for the benefit of our guests. John the Baptist! Hallelujah! Amen. Hallelujah! Hymn number 65. Hello. Ah. Why aren't you in with this lot? - I told my mother I'd got a cold. At chapel time I was off to the woods. - With your fiddle? Very nice. Don't you approve of the Welsh Sunday? It's as dead as what I'm sitting on. Don't forget your music. - Oh. Are you the visitor? - Yes, I'm from London. London? Oh! They tell me your trunk come last night, Mr...? Davis. - Davis? A Welshman? I've been out of Wales for 20 years. I'm a cosmopolitan. - Oh, dear me! Are we up on business? I'm going to see Lady Dolwyn in the morning. Oh? Uh-uh! The best sermon since Easter Sunday. He was in good voice, no doubt about it. Diction they call it. - Nos da, Idris. - Nos da, sir. Lovely with Lady Dolwyn there too, I was thinking. Now the other cow's not well now. - There's a pity. I am sorry. Good night, Will. - Good night, Nonna. Don't go breaking your neck now, not on a Sunday. Sale by auction on Saturday. Do you like the trimmings on my hat? - Oh, it's better, isn't it? Not yet, but his trunk came last night. I'll tell her. He wants you to go for a walk. My mother wouldn't like it. - Well, don't tell her. First prize in the dog show. - Come on, Gruffyd. Did Sep tell you about our Eisteddfod for next March. No, my neck's no better. The good weather is bad for it. Soprano, I think. - Good night, Auntie Maggie. Yes, yes, indeed. Look at Margaret. Pretty! All these years and I've never been inside. I'm so glad we came. Lady Dolwyn and Miss Margaret, what a keen pleasure it is for all of us to have you back in our little circle. Thank you. And how is little John? Very well, my lady. Thank you for remembering. How was Rome this spring, Lady Dolwyn? Beautiful. - All them antiquities! Good evening, my lady. - Good evening. Such a charming sermon, Jabbez. I wish I could have understood. - Oh, thank you, my lady. Excuse me, my lady. - It is an extraordinary language. Home, Jabbez, of course. - Goodbye. Ah, a visitor. I will make one guess who it is. Mr Davis, I've no doubt. Oh, the door locked in your face. I am sorry but I'm shut up all day Sunday, you see. The gentleman's bag, now. Brysio, brysio! I am sorry to have kept you waiting but the calls of the Sabbath, you know. Come in, come in. Welcome to Dolwyn. Quick, boy, quick. He doesn't seem to like it here much. Oh, funny boy, but with these orphans you never know. But he mentioned his mother. - Ah, that would be his foster mother. A widow. Lost her own baby and to lighten her darkness took two boys, orphans, and has brought them up very creditable, the poor foster mother, with her only the chapel caretaker. There's some pickled onions, if you don't mind that. And I've a local cheese for you, not too bad. Is it edible? - Oh, I don't think so. Somebody at the door for me, she said in the Welsh. Good evening. I've been to Liverpool twice. Pleasure trip. A change from here. These country places are so... so delapid, are they not? But fancy you being Welsh. Where was you from? Far from here? 300 yards. - Yards? Bunant Farm. - You lived there? I slept in the straw in the outhouses. Did you never hear the scandal? Oh, yes, my auntie did tell me once. Oh, I won't tell anybody. Tell them all. Tell them I was the 12-year-old tramp who was caught in this chapel stealing the collection money and chased out by the other boys. They threw stones after me. They laughed at me. And here I am back. - On business? On business. Pleasure, too. You never know. Oh, now you're making fun of a country bumpkin. Sit down and tell me all about the other country bumpkins. Oh, I couldn't, not on a Sunday. Good night. You're talking more rubbish than the Tower of Babel. Hear, hear! Let us capitulate the argument. - Hear, hear! The preacher tonight gave expression to a belief in predestination. He did nothing of the...! - Nos da. - Nos da. Are you better, Dafydd? Yes, thank you, Mam. - That is a blessing. Now, for your headache. Oh, now, Mam. I'm doing all right. Oh. Lovely sermon, Dafydd. My eyes was fit to make a tear for that poor John the Baptist. And then I thought, "Silly woman. "He has been sitting up in heaven since long before you came to earth. "So cheer up." Mr Jabbez Jones is a preacher from the heart. Oh, Mam. You mean Jabbez coachman? You and your mister. He's not much better than our lot. Oh, but he is, Dafydd. He's nearer to God than us. Well, here we are. Supper now. Now... I wonder what your brother will be doing now in that great big city. How much difference in the time between us and Liverpool? None at all. - None? You're thinking of America, Mam. - Oh, fancy that! Makes me feel a bit better. Gareth! What's the...? Sut mae, Mam? We're all right now, Mam. Quiet! Now, this Salome, was she a bad thing? Dancing in front of people? Well, it's not too terrible. It was a habit. - High spirits, you see. But taking a man's head and serving it up on a dish like it was a bit of dinner, there's no sense in that. She didn't fancy him, perhaps. Now, the doctrine of predestination... Hide your beers! Salome! Now you can tell us. Did Mr Rogers who put you behind his counter find that you was not sharp enough for the city ways? I... ran away. - From Liverpool? Mam, you've got no idea what they are like, those big places. In Liverpool they got houses with seven windows, one on top of the other. Seven? I would be afraid for them to fall on top of me when I wasn't looking. And fog all day long and nothing green, Mam. Not a flower, only in women's hats, and them false. And all the people strangers to each other. No! If I was not to know who everybody was, I would have to go up and ask them. Well, Mam, in Liverpool you'd be tired by the end of the day, I can tell you. But what finished me was the trams. Trams? Dear me! What's trams? - The latest thing. Up and down they go, making terrible noise, stopping in the street and then starting and more terrible noise... Women are they? Oh, surely not. Well, I see the trams and the houses and all the flowers false and the people pushing and... well, here I am, home in Dolwyn. Well! Can I go to Liverpool in his place? - No, you would get into bad ways. Oh, Mam! - Say grace, Dafydd. Nos da. Nos da, John. Spio, Mr Jones! - Bore da. - Bore da. Mind the step! - Bore da, Mam. Mind the step! - Bore da, Mam. Hi. How can I get driven to Dolwyn Hall? But it's down on that next corner, sir. I know, but I still want to be driven. If you're too tired to walk, I got a wheelbarrow. I said to myself, "I'd rather Dolwyn," so home I come. Well... I missed you terrible, Gareth, with my leg. Eira next door did come in to help but it's not the same. Only have a rest today. Start work tomorrow, isn't it? I'll go upstairs with my leg. Hello. Drive me to Dolwyn Hall, will you? I know it's on the corner. Oh, but it would never do for you to land up at the Hall on your feet. What would they think? No, I will take you nice and stately, like a hearse, never you fear. Fancy you being that bad boy from Bunant Farm. I remember it well. Please do take it to heart that none of us bear you no grudge. That's uncommonly good of you. Come on, Myfanwy. Dolwyn Hall. Oh, dear! "Your ladyship, "we fear that our three previous communications have escaped your..." They haven't escaped my ladyship's attention at all. I always feel they're harmless once you run them through the middle. It's very silly of me. Oh, what does Colin say? "My love..." - Ah. "Just off to the club with Grant. "Belgravia looks much the same." "Just off to the club" all crossed out because he realised he'd just said it. "In haste, your affec. Fiance." He writes a good letter. I don't love him. I know. But you find a whole month here intolerably dull. Oh, I like it. Would you like me to stay so as they see the conveyance? No, thank you. - Right. Well, if it isn't...! - The name is Mr Davis. Yes, sir. Mr Davis. - Oh, yes. Lady Dolwyn. - Oh, how do you do? My niece, Miss Winter. - How do you do? You're going to talk business. I'll go for my walk. Good. Such a lovely day. Do sit down. Oh, thank you. Now... Mr Davis, let us come to the point. I don't feel happy about this proposition. Did Lord Lancashire mention in his letter the figure we're prepared to pay you? That's the trouble. I can't afford to refuse. - Exactly. Now, this is my plan, Lady Dolwyn. "To all Dolwyn leaseholders..." Oh, it seems so unkind on a day like this. Oh, dear. - Sut mae, Gareth. - Sut mae, Huw. Excuse me. I have never spoke to you... I have never spoken to you. But I have seen you many a time... ...on this very place when you have took your walk. When you have taken your walk. Again. Excuse me. Mrs Richards! It was a question of acquainting you with our plans and we felt that the best way of telling you my news would be to gather you here quite informally. Now... I'll be brief. Lord Lancashire is president of the Cambrian Water Company, formed to supply the towns of Lancashire with the water which they need. Seven years ago he acquired for this purpose Lake Dyrdi and Lake Menwyn, the plan being to convey the water from the one to the other by means of tunnels through the Nant Gwyn mountain. The water to be first transferred to the tunnels via a landmark which has been familiar to you for the six years it has taken to complete it, the Dyrdi dam. A month ago, however, it was discovered that the core of the mountain, which had been put down as limestone, was granite, an insuperable barrier. The only way out is to bring the water down as soon as possible via the Dolwyn valley. That is, to turn the Dolwyn valley into another lake. Well, that is the position. Lady Dolwyn has shown herself cooperative in a fine cause. It only remains for the lesser leaseholders, your good selves, to part with your leases. Oh, for a fair sum, of course. Erm...? He says, "Where are we going to live?" Oh, I was coming to that. Lord Lancashire is also chairman of the Hagton Building Society. Hagton being a suburb of Liverpool where he is erecting a square mile of houses to accommodate the workers in the new cotton mill. He says, "Who runs the cotton mill?" Oh, Lord Lancashire. He's overworking himself, poor fellow. And our proposition is accommodation on the estate and employment in the mill. Now, what could be fairer than that? Is there no other way of transferring the water? Er, none. Not even through the Horseshoe Glen? That was discussed but would prove ruinously expensive to his Lordship. Any other questions. But there are 19 inhabitants who are not leaseholders who rent their cottages week by week. And who do not have to be consulted. - What's going to happen to them? Well, it's a free country. They can do as they like. We shall do everything we can to accommodate them on the estate. I shall be very happy tomorrow to call on you each personally to arrange terms. Thank you. Thank you. Do ring for more coffee and biscuits. - Lady Dolwyn, may I say one word? Oh, do. There are two ways of telling the truth. Nobody knows that better than a man who wears his collar back to front. And Mr Davis has offered you money, homes and work. That is true. But it is also true, my friends, that your consent is being sought for the village of Dolwyn to be drowned. You are free to choose. The drowning will be fulfilled by the waters crawling with the feet of 1,000 serpents down the road you have just walked, under the doors, into the houses. In at the windows, up the stairs, over the roofs, over the nests of birds into the chimneys, over the chimneys. Dolwyn will be drowned. A handful of insanitary dwellings will by a miracle of science become useful... To you. To me and to a million human beings. How are the roses, Sep? Oh, they'll be just about right for the flower show, Gareth. Un, dau, tri, pedwar... It's very quiet in Dolwyn tonight, Gareth. It was all them people going to the Hall. - That's right. Mam, fancy this Mr Davis being that boy that broke into chapel that time. I know, poor lad. I had to feel sorry for him. I'm all the more glad now he's done so well in the world. All credit to him. Any news from the shop? Hynant Farm called in to say that a calf come into the world this morning and next year they're building a new chimney. Next year? As soon as that? We'll wait for Dafydd for supper, eh? Nobody else you saw? No. Shall I read you a passage? - That's a good boy. "The Lord is my shepherd," shall we have? Like they say in the English. Bad news? No, Mam, good. We are leaving! Leaving? - We are going to live in Liverpool. Liverpool? Liverpool? - That's right. They're going to flood Dolwyn to send water to Lancashire. What about them at the Hall? Well, they will have to move and go back to London for good. London? - And, Mam, we are going to Liverpool. Are you all right, Mam? I don't seem to take in the news. Oh, but, Mam, I have told you. We are going to have shop windows and... and carriages passing, bursting with money. And do you know what will be three miles out by tram? A racecourse. In Dolwyn? - No, Mam. In Hagton suburb in Liverpool. How far is that? - 100 miles. Oh. That's a terrible long way from home. I never been over the edge of that mountain. Shall I look after supper, Mam? No. A man cooking? I never heard of such a thing. She has not took it in. Don't say no more. You was going to read, Gareth. That's right. "The Lord is my shepherd..." Like the Exodus we'll be, in the Old Testament. Mam! - Oh, Sep. We have found it in the encyclopaedia. But we would be moving after the event, wouldn't we? No, Sep, the flower show's in September. We'll be drowned by then and living in Liverpool. Suburb. Hagton suburb. Suburb? Suburb? But you have been to Liverpool and time and time again you have told me that you like it. Yes, but then I always had Dolwyn to come back to. Are you telling me, Dorcas Griffiths, that you've never been so much at home in Liverpool as you made out? Well, I wasn't. Aren't I sly? You see, when I'm in Liverpool I feel countrified. And when I'm in Dolwyn I feel citified. And I'm in my element feeling citified so better I stay in Dolwyn, isn't it? Dorcas! - Coming. Mary Jane! - What is it? We're all going to be deported to England! I know. Are you all right, Mam? Thank you very much. - Not at all. Good morning. I don't want to hurry anybody, but time is short. Why don't you put your name to the paper? There's only this old stiff neck left and he'll sign if you will. ? 600. The palm of my hand is itching for that money. Then sign, man, sign! Oh! - Ah! The inside of my head, too much going on in there. Go away, all of you! Ladies in a public house. For shame! You know what they got in them Liverpool houses? Things that you turn and water comes out. Taps. - Taps, you see? Yes, taps is lovely things. They toil not, neither do they spin. I've been sitting here for 22 years. Yes, and what you want is to be sitting here for another 22 years? With the roof falling on you? - Solid as rock! Who was it was gnashing of his teeth last Tuesday because of that new leak and saying the whole place wants throwing away? That was in the course of conversation, not meant to be used against me now. You ought to be up in that London parliament with that young Lloyd George, that's what you ought. Excuse me, your ladyship. - Yes? It's my mother. - Your mother? The chapel caretaker. - Yes, I know she is. Ask her into the hall. I shan't be a minute. Do you know what I would like? - What? To stay here and have the? 600. Toss up. Heads we sign. But they're all sovereigns. Think of 600 of them. Heads. That's done the trick. - That's right. Next spring we was to hold an eisteddfod in Dolwyn. Let's drink to it, shall we? They got the spring in Liverpool. We can have the eisteddfod in their Hagton suburb. With all them taps running. Sit down, won't you? Thank you. There. Now, what can I do for...? Of course, you've never been here before, have you? It's lovely. Like a railway station, isn't it? Though I've never been in one myself. So much going on. I know what you mean. Is it about your son? All last night I thought, "Lady Dolwyn is the one who will stop it. "For the name of the place. Dolwyn is her own name. "And she will not let it go." I'll try to explain. My husband left me in financial difficulties. I'm sorry. I do not understand them words. Oh, I beg your pardon. I'm very poor. Poor? But I thought the rich was always the rich, that is ladies and gentlemen like you, same as the poor is the poor, that is people like me. I'm afraid it isn't quite as simple as that. You see, I'm deeply in debt. You mean, there are things that are not paid for? I'm afraid so. And so a lot of water has to come to Dolwyn that got no business to be here? Yes. Well! Well, I... I'm afraid I have some letters to finish. If there was... - Yes? Excuse me, the English comes to me slow. If we could build a wall round Dolwyn, would that be the thing? How do you mean? - The water would flow past the wall and, indeed, without the dust of the village street it would taste all the better in Lancashire. What is that? - My sovereigns. I would be very pleased to start the collection for the wall with the 15 in there. I'm afraid it would need a higher wall than that. Oh. Excuse me. - Yes? Isn't Lancashire by the sea? - Yes. Well, why cannot the Lancashire English make do with the water on the doorstep? I'm afraid drinking salt water would kill even the English in the end. But salt is good for you, isn't it? Oh. But wouldn't you like a nice new home? You'd have your boys and your furniture. Why, nothing would be changed. Oh, but everything would be changed. In Liverpool you would not find your own river by your front door. And if you did, the stones would not look the same. You would not find a poor old church on the hill. Or the well next to the milestone. Or the chapel face to face with a bakehouse, both having the same place in your esteem. Not anywhere else. And that old sun, if he was to see me from anywhere only from behind these hills, he would not know me, would he? And the birds would not sing the same. I never been there but I do know the fowls of the air in Liverpool is a pretty poor lot. The Dolwyn cows and sheep, they are of the family, too. No, there'll be never anything to make up for all of that. By the end of a year my heart would break. I'm sorry. Everything has been arranged. Well, thank you. I'm sorry. Good morning, your ladyship. Open the gate, will you? Give me a hand. - All right. I can't get in or out of my own house. Oh, it looks terrible without it. Put it back till the last minute. All right. Oh. - Thank you. Where is your mam? - She wouldn't come. Oh. Amen. Sir! Sir? - Yes, Merri? One thing I could not say to Lady Dolwyn that day, with her not so proper Welsh. Tell me, Merri. - Sir... It is my little child. - Which one, Merri? Oh, not these two that I adopted, but my own that the Lord took from me. Well... that boy has lain under that chapel wall for 20 years, no trouble, feeling that little tree growing over him, loving him there. It is a thing to make people smile, I know. But you see, sir, his father was drowned in the sea, and I cannot bear to think that this time tomorrow he will be like his poor father was. I would be a boastful man, Merri, if I thought I could help, except with a dozen words of the old Welsh. Amen. Thank you, sir. The sofa across there, that's right. Hm, it's not going to look too bad. Oh, and one or two chairs over there. Where are you going, dear? - To the village. I want some gloves for the journey tomorrow. I lost one ages ago. - What's the matter? I know you don't mean it, Auntie, but it does seem so heartless. Heartless? Giving the dance tonight, the last night of Dolwyn. But that's just the reason I am giving it, because the surrounding gentry would be offended if I didn't. Oh, how very rude and so unlike her! I don't mind. She's very young. A workhouse. We are sitting drinking beer in a workhouse. A workhouse? You with? 600 under your elbow! I'm easing my mind into this. Don't pick on me. Everybody else who has signed has repented with me, except you three vultures. Hark to their jubilations! Caradoc Roberts, are you going to have babes and sucklings teaching you things? Up, boys, up. The young like anything new, the more spick and span the better. That's right, Jab, because they're spick and span theirselves. Well, I'm not. I was once, but not now. Perhaps we will not find Liverpool so bad as she is painted. You hate it, Huw. Have you never heard what they say of us Welsh? That we cry easy but we dry easy, too. Come on. It will go to waste if we don't have it. Oh, Gareth, it's our journey tomorrow. I am sorry for my leg. Oh, I beg your pardon. I know it's an awkward time but have you any gloves? I'm afraid I don't speak Welsh. We have not got nothing in stock good enough to offer. Thank you. We have not got nothing good enough, not even grammar! Is something broken, Gareth? No. If you want to go to the Hall, Gareth, you can. The Hall? But the party's for the gentry. No, no, I mean to help your brother with the top hats and all that. It's going to be flooded, you know? - Oh, really? Yes, isn't it a pity? It's going to be flooded. - So you told me. Oh, I do hope they're beginning to enjoy themselves. Can you dance? I never tried. Tomorrow? - I go to London. And I go the other way. We will not think about it, not tonight. Not tonight. You get some sleep, Mam. - I'm all right, Gareth. That's him, when he was at sea. Birth certificate. Mam! Co-operative store's receipts, 15 years ago. Out of date, Gareth. Who was loan Gronant, Mam? - My grandfather. Why, Gareth? - Which was Sir William Dolwyn? Oh, he was the owner of these parts in the olden days. Mam, to who do you pay the rent for this house? Rent? Oh, we haven't paid any rent since long before my time. We've been lucky that way. But why have you not paid any rent? Well, I suppose the Hall started letting us off out of kindness for us being such a poor lot. I never thought about it. It says here that your grandfather saved Sir William's life from a runaway horse. That's right. - But it says here... Mam, can I travel in my best suit? - Shh. As a token of gratitude, he... Yes, Gareth? He presents to loan Gronant and any direct descendant in perp... perpetuity the half acre of ground known as Tyravon Cottage, Dolwyn. What is perpetuity, Gareth? Forever, Mam. Forever? It means that this house is your property. It's got a seal and witnesses and everything. You're not going to try and stop me getting to Liverpool? It says that this house cannot be sold without your consent. Perhaps it is too old-fashioned for now. The town hall will soon tell me that first thing in the morning. More round, more round. Straight into the van. Hurry up, will you? We have to be out of here by 11 o'clock. Go on, tell him. What are you, a practical joker? No, sir, the solicitor for the town hall, sir, and I'm sorry to say, sir, that that is a watertight legal document. And do you know the English for watertight? No water. Is anything the matter? - No. Terrible muddle for you, Mr Davis. Bore da, Mr Davis. Terrible day for Dolwyn. - Terrible day! Oh, I am sorry. Do you think she'll give in, Mr Davis? Terrible muddle for you! Bore da, Merri! Oh, bore da. "Dolwyn a hitch. "This afternoon's submerging ceremony by Lord Lancashire "is unavoidably postponed." Here it is, look. None of us took much notice of her, to tell you the truth. Only don't put that down in your paper. Congratulations. Oh, thank you, sir. Oh, but it isn't harvest festival. That will not be for another two months. It's wonderful to think after a life of toil you can now retire in comfort. Oh. I've got years of toil in front of me before my comfort. You'd be surprised. I'm going to give you a shock. - Yes, sir? Would you like? 100? - No, thank you. ? 500? - No, thank you. I see. Well, how much do you want? You see, I do not like the idea of a lot of money. You don't like the idea? It would turn my head. Nobody wants to see a grown woman with her head turned, do they? ? 500, the idea! I might go and buy one of them ostrich feathers and parade up and down Dolwyn. That would never do. Excuse me, sir. You must excuse me. I have an appointment at the dam. Have you ever seen over the dam? - Oh, no, sir. Oh, but you must. Lady Dolwyn and I are driving up this afternoon. We'll call for you. - Oh, thank you, sir. With Lady Dolwyn? A great honour. Good afternoon, sir. It's fascinating. - Explain to the ladies, will you? Yes, sir. Now, this is the master valve. The simple movement of turning this handle is sufficient to unlock no less than 20 flood valves. As well as these four down here. - Really? And all of them, when opened to their full diameter, would have been sufficient to flood the valley, the water being forced down by the immense weight of Lake Dyrdi which is pressing hundreds of tons against this wall. Don't frighten the ladies, Watkins. How do they know the wall will not crack? Oh, not much fear of that. If it did, there's an automatic alarm here that would soon tell the whole valley. Lord Lancashire has forgotten nothing. - Evidently. When the time comes, this wheel will release... Tell the ladies how much this delay is costing Lord Lancashire. Watkins? Not Myfanwy Edwards' boy that married loan Watkins? That's right. - Oh, I know your face so well. In a curious way, I'm glad it's over. I hated the idea. It is not over, Lady Dolwyn. - Isn't it? Not if I have to bring Lord Lancashire down here himself. All the same, what one could have done with the money. Ah, well. What one could do with the money. The sick children, sick grown-ups even. - What do you mean? Well, by preventing them from selling she's depriving them of medical care that might patch up a broken life. Aren't there any? - No. No paralysis? - No. No consumptive? Gruffyd Farm had a cough once but it's been gone some time. Is there anybody with anything wrong with them? Ann Jane's got heart trouble. Ah. Would you say that she was in need of expert medical attention? How old is she? - 102. Oh! On his knees, Mr Davis was to her, in the chapel. And she took the bunch of flowers and hit him on the head with it. That is gospel truth, and another thing... His Lordship's language was not fit to repeat, not even in a public house. I come out with something without thinking and there it is in the headline. Oh, I am upset. I mean, Davis, you wrote me you'd got the whole thing as snug as a bug in a rug and here am I having to come down and deal with this woman myself. Oh! And riddled with rheumatism. I mean to say, you gave me to understand that you were submerging a bunch of condemned outhouses. I'd no idea it was a village. I mean, live and let live. Had I known, I'd have settled upon that alternative and got the water round by that... whatcha-ma-call-it... glen. Expensive but better that than this rumpus. We mustn't give up hope. I beg your pardon, my lord. Give up hope? Flooding a village? Anyone would think you'd got a grudge against it. May I see your newspaper, my lord? Grand day. - Lovely! Ah! Lovely big man! What language do I talk to her? Hindustani? - She speaks perfect English, my lord. Bah! Mam is expecting his lordship. Very windy. Door's banging. Now, look here... - Make yourself comfortable, will you? Homemade. No, thank you. I'm not hungry. Now... - About this confounded... Sugar and milk? - Milk, no sugar. Your taste for tea has a resemblance to that of my boys. It is identical. - I say, you speak pretty good English. Oh, no. But you know what it is with us Welsh. The best we have in the shop we put in the window, isn't it? There is your tea. - Now, look here... I call these my Lord Lancashire cups. We all go them free at the coming-of-age. And on the other side is the Queen. You don't seem to realise who I am. I am Lord Lancashire. Oh, yes, they told me you would be calling. Make yourself at home. You will have had a cup of tea with her, no doubt. The Queen? I did once, as a matter of fact. Goodness, what an honour! Nobody else there? - Well, yes, as a matter of fact. How many? Couple of thousand. - Oh. Now, look here... Oh! Have you hurt yourself? - Oh, this confounded rheumatism. I am sorry. Has it been with you long? Two years. It's driving me crazy. In the shoulder? That is where Caradoc Dolwyn Arms had it for a year. He had it? He got rid of it? That's right. Well, what cured him? I did. - You did? How? Oh, just a trick, I suppose. If you would like me... Excuse me. I shall have to hurt you for a minute. - Yes, yes. Hm... Oh! It's a fight. Do you think we ought to separate them? Nice clean place you've got here. Clean enough, perhaps, my son was saying, not to need any more water than it got already. Oh. How big is your property? - Oh, just this room and up the stairs. How long have you been living in it? - 200 years. Have you got a nice property? - It's not bad. Much of it? - 3,000 acres. Dear me. But you can get fond of a big place, too, can't you? That's true. There we are. It's... It's gone! The pain's gone! - Nice, isn't it? But it's been there for two years. It will come back in three or four weeks for a bit. Will you come and treat me again? Oh, well, I have got my work. I'll drive over if I may, as soon as I feel a twinge. With pleasure. Now, if you will excuse me. - Oh, certainly. He-he! It's gone, it's gone! I am glad. - It's gone! Would it be convenient if I call within a month? Yes, certainly. Morning or afternoon. - The afternoon would be best. Oh, sir, you have not called to see me? Oh, what an honour! Oh! I am grateful to you. Good afternoon. I am going to have the water sent down through the Horseshoe Glen. You've made a fool of me, but you've made a bigger fool of yourself. Home. - Yes, my lord. Oh, no! No, no! Go on, don't be shy! I'll give you some nasty medicine for this! Everybody's acting very childish tonight. More than childish. Infantile. Salome! Come on! Now are you glad we came down? - I'm the night watchman, don't forget. I hope she'll be all right without us. Who? - The dam. She'll look after herself. She's big enough. Come on! These three days, always we will have them. Three days we've stolen. Because by now these trees would have been under water. Shadows. Shadows of hedges. Doors swinging gently on their hinges. But no noise, because it's water. Shadows of people, walking under the water. You and me, looking for each other. Don't. Merri! Merri, Merri, Merri! Speech! Speech! Speech! It's the automatic alarm. The dam! Quick, man, get them out! That way! Come on, Mam! - Hurry! You go and help the children. This way! Mam! Mam! No sign of any water. No, not a sound. False alarm. Let's go back. No, we can't be sure yet. Oh, don't you think we might be moving back? Not yet. Have you seen her? - No. Oh! Mrs Thomas, have you seen Mam? - No, Gareth. She must be with the lot that come up the Nant field. No, Gareth, I was with them. What a night! Mam! Who's that? What are you trying to do? - Settle an account with the village. I thought at first water... - You gave that false alarm! But it's going to be fire. Put that can down. - Get out! Put it down! - You dare to give me orders! You or any of 'em! I am going to remind you of something, you and your miserable Dolwyn. Years and years ago, a thief, a 12-year-old thief, you turned him out, remember? You threw stones after him. You laughed at him, remember? You've all forgotten, haven't you? Well, I haven't. That woman thought this village was hers. Well, she made the mistake of her life because she'd forgotten one thing. Money. Money can buy anything, my friend. And I've got it. This village is mine. And I can do what I like with it. Put that can down. You laughed at me as well, didn't you? Aren't you the one that calls himself her son? The one who doesn't know who his real mother was, or his father? If you say that again, you will be sorry. You're not fit to lick my boots, neither you nor her. Say one word about her, I'll kill you. But I'm going to pay you both to clean my boots because you're the scum of the earth. Both of you. Yes, she as well. Scum! Scum! Scum! I warned you. Scum! Scum! Scum! Scum! Say something. Say something! Brandy, brandy! I didn't mean to do it, Mam. - Do what, Gareth? I didn't mean to do it. We must fetch a doctor. - It's no good, Mam. His heart's stopped. I killed him. We must fetch a doctor. He's dead, Mam! I killed him, I killed him! Don't say such a thing, Gareth. Them things do not happen, not in such parts of the world as Dolwyn. We must fetch a doc... Oh! Thou shalt not kill. - Mam... You're not going to give me up to the police for me to be hanged? No, I cannot be strong enough to do that. But they will come down and find... They must not find it. But how can we keep it from them? - We must... What's in your mind, Mam? Perhaps, God helping me, I can keep it from them. Those others up on the hill, they would shed a tear for Dolwyn, I know, but if they knew why I was doing it, they would give me a pardon. Now with this terrible thing come upon us, which I cannot properly take in yet, a lot comes clear to me, Gareth, all of a sudden. Perhaps it is a punishment from the Lord for me turning proud and glorying in my worldly goods, stirring up hatred in Dolwyn. Go to the others and do not say nothing. But what are you going to do? - Do as I tell you, Gareth. Do you think I would leave you? Do not make it the more hard for me to do what I got to do. Go up to the others. But will you be safe? - I will, Gareth. I will see you up there. Ohh! Hey! Hurry! My Gareth! Oh! Look! - What is it? What's the matter? - What is it? John Henry! The big girder must have held it back for a time.
