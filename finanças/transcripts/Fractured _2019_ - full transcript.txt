It's crazy! What do you want me to say? I'm trying here, Jo! Just... You tell me what you need me to say. The fact that you don't know what to say, that's the problem. You know what it is? They just never liked me. No, that's not true. Really, 'cause your Dad's sitting there offering me wine as if he didn't know. And your Mom's just sittin' on the other side of the table shootin' me dirty looks. Maybe she was upset because the turkey was getting cold, Ray. What do I got to do with the turkey? It took so long for you to get us there. I was driving 55. I drove the speed limit. Is that the problem, Jo? I am a safe driver. Okay. Look, why don't we just go home and do Thanksgiving all over again, all right? Just the three of us. Our way. We could get pizza. Peri loves pizza. And then we can be thankful for each other. Yeah? We need to stop kidding ourselves, Ray. We're just... ...broken. We have been for a long time. I don't know why you would say that. I would talk to you about it if we ever actually talked, but we don't. That's not fair. I work, and sometimes I just like to... think. But you don't fight for anything anymore. You used to. What about us? Who do you want me to be? I want you to be yourself. The guy that I married six years ago. The guy that I used to laugh with and... and... and dream with and... I'm still that guy, Jo. I'm in a patch, and I admit it, but I love you, okay? And maybe I should just say it more often, 'cause I love you... Ray! Jesus. - It's not working. - Okay. It broke, Mommy, and the songs won't play. Let me see it, baby. Probably the batteries. Right, Daddy? Yeah. Probably the batteries. You brought extras, right? I told you. I left them on the... the counter. Daddy will get you some more batteries, all right, sweetie? Hey, I have an idea. Let's play I Spy. - Blech. - Blech? - What do you mean, "blech"? - Why don't we sing a song? - Let's start with one obvious one. - Let's sing a song. - "Shake It Off." - I Spy... Hm. That's a good one too, but I'm thinking more "Sing a Rainbow." Okay. - Maybe it's gotten a little babyish, Ray. - One, two... ♪ Red and yellow ♪ ♪ And pink and green ♪ ♪ Orange and purple and blue ♪ ♪ I can sing a rainbow ♪ ♪ Sing a rainbow ♪ - ♪ Sing a rainbow for you ♪ - ♪ Listen with your eyes ♪ ♪ Listen with your ears ♪ ♪ And sing everything you see ♪ ♪ I can sing a rainbow ♪ ♪ Sing a rainbow ♪ ♪ Sing a rainbow with me ♪ Daddy? Yeah? I gotta go potty. What, right now? - I gotta go. - Can you hold it? No. Okay, I'll pull over at the next rest stop, and then we'll... tinkle. Okay? Maybe they'll have batteries. Mommy, come on! I have to go! All right, baby. Lean forward. Remember, we don't touch anything that we don't have to in there. Can you get me a Coke, please? - Yeah. - I don't know why, but I'm parched. And can I get a four-pack of AA batteries, please? And two of these, please. Okay. No plastic. Okay, just... just the coffee and the Coke and the... Thank you. Did you get batteries? They didn't have any. Mommy, my compact! Where is it? I don't know, why are you asking me, Per? Because it's gone! What... Did you check on the seat under your bum? Yes, it's not there. - I had it in the ladies' room, remember? - You check your pocket? In the ladies' room? Okay. Well, I will go check in the ladies' room. But if I find it in there, you don't get to touch it until we get home, okay? Okay. Will you check in the back, under the seats? Yeah. Daddy, check the seats. Come on. Up, up, up. Here we go. I got ya. All right. Right, just stay right there. Peri, where is the... It's a pigsty back here. Where am I even meant to begin, you know? God damn it! Daddy. I just... This shi... This is gonna stain. You know? What if I wanted to resell this car? Can't even do that. I guess this is just the cherry on the cake, this is. Come on... Peri, there's no sign of the thing. Daddy. Daddy! - Daddy! - What? What? Peri, don't move. All right, don't be scared. Just stay right there. Hey! Dog! Go on! Hey! Go on. Go on. Go on, move. No, no, Peri, not you. J-Just stay there. Peri, don't move. Don't move. Don't move, okay? Go on! Go on, get! Don't move. Peri, stop. Don't move. It's gonna be okay. I'm just gonna scare him. No! No! Sorry, Mr. Monroe. She's gone. They're both gone. Ray? Uh, Ray? Ray? Ray? Ray! Ray! Ray! Ray! Ray! Ray! Ray! Ray! My baby! Ray! Ray! Daddy. Peri? Baby? Baby? Oh, my... Oh, my God. Baby? Baby? Baby? - Joanne, don't move her. - She's okay. She's okay. She's okay. Put her down. She's okay. She's okay. There you go. I'm right here. I'm right here. You hurt? I don't think so. Okay. Well, there doesn't seem to be any scratches or bruises. Ray, she needs a doctor. I know what I'm doin'. - Ray... - I'm gonna pick you up, all right? - Ow! - Hold on. What is it? What is it? - My arm, Daddy. It hurts. - This arm? I think it's broken. Let's try again. Nice and slow. Don't hurt me, Daddy. I would never hurt you, sweetie. I would never hurt you. Gentle, Daddy. - Gentle, Ray. - Okay. It's all right. Up we go. Here we go. Daddy's got you. Here we go. Yeah, here we go. Here we are. Here we go. Shh. It's okay. I'm calling 911. - Don't bother. I'll drive. - Ray... I saw a hospital sign a few miles back. By the time that ambulance gets here, we'd have gotten her to help. Are you sure? Joanne, I got this. We're gonna stay awake until we get to the hospital. Daddy's gonna get us there real fast. Okay? Move. Hurry, Ray, hurry. Nearly there. Oh, come on, come on, come on. Oh! Ray. Hurry. Ray? Ray. Ray! Okay. There it is! There it is. There it is. Okay. Daddy's got us. - Almost there. - We're there. All right, right. I'll go get a wheelchair. Nah, I'm gonna carry her. Okay, sweetie. I'll go get us checked in. All right? I won't be long, sweetie. Okay. We've been waiting for hours. What's taking so long? I understand. - He's in pain. - I apologize. I'm gonna find someone for you here, right... Ray. This is gonna take a sec. You should take a seat, make her more comfortable. She's really hurting. I know. I'll take care of it. Okay. So it doesn't matter that the address has changed, That's okay? All right. Excuse me. I need a doctor. There's been an accident. - Do you mind? - Take a seat. We'll be with you shortly. - Hang on, it's my daughter. - No! - We think she broke her arm. - Sir, take a seat, and I assure you... - She's in a lot of pain! - ...we'll get you checked in as soon as possible. - Take a seat. - I just need to see someone. Enough. Sit down. Wait your turn. Please. I'm sure it won't be long. I heard her, Ray. Mm-hmm. Just stay calm. I'll be calm when a doctor sees our daughter. It's okay. Shh, shh, shh. Daddy's gonna take care of us. What do you want me to do? You want me to kick down the doors - and drag a doctor out here? - Yes. That I'd like to see. Do something. Do something, Ray. Sir? How can I help you, sir? Yeah, I really need to see that doctor, right now. I understand. But as I told you before, sir, there are other patients ahead of you. Can you just squeeze us in? She's sick. She doesn't know what's going on. - Did you sign in? - What? It moves a lot faster if you sign in. Y-You told me to sit down. Mr. Fellows? Dale Fellows. Hi, Dale. How are you feeling today? He has a sharp pain in his stomach. Bit of paperwork first, and we'll get him admitted. Would you happen to know what Dale's blood type is? B positive. Another one. Maybe 15 years old. B positive. Let Dr. Berthram know. Dr. Berthram... Dr. Berthram... Please go back to your seat, sir. I'll let you know when a doctor becomes available. - We're on the list now. - Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. She's sleeping. Okay. Here, hold this. It's so hot in here. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to... bite your head off earlier. It's okay. Uh... We're gonna be fine. Thank you. For what? For getting us here so fast. I just did what needed to be done. - Well, you missed your calling. - Yeah? Driving NASCAR. Ah, man, I missed that. Missed what? Just... laughing with you. Mm... You okay? My head is just... mm, like, throbbing. I mean, you're probably dehydrated. I can fix that. There you go. - Thank you. - Who are they? They are the ones who fight and don't give up, keeping our families safe. Sons, husbands, fathers. Our heroes. Monroe. Ray Monroe. Yeah, go on. Can I see your driver's license and insurance card? - All this information is correct? - Yeah. Your occupation? I work at Craft Home Improvement. He's the assistant manager for the kitchen and bathroom design center. Has Peri had any prior surgeries? Allergies? Yes. She reacts to penicillin. Her skin breaks out in a rash. Any history of mental illness in the family? No. Drugs? Alcoholism? I'm a recovering alcoholic. How long is this going to take? Just a couple of minutes. Your insurance records show a prior dependent, Abby Monroe. My first wife is deceased. And this happened...? Eight years ago. Why is this relevant? There's just an overlap in your plan that your PPO never fixed. Were you at the same employer then? No. I was self-employed and, um... - Listen... - And you're married? - Yeah. Yeah. - Of course, yeah. - How many years? - Six. Honestly, how long is this gonna take? We're almost finished. Would you like Peri listed for organ donation? No. Can I convince you to reconsider? The number of children on the transplant list is... Not now, please. What is your daughter's blood type? Your blood types? O, I think. That's all right. We can crossmatch later if necessary. - Why would that be necessary? - Last one. The state requires me to ask if everything is safe in the household. - Really? - Ray... With these types of injuries, sir, I am mandated by law. Okay, but this was an accident at a construction site. Ray... Yes, we're safe. Our household... - is safe. - Mommy? All right, then. We're done. I'll get a nurse to take you back. Oh. My arm, it still hurts. - What? - I know, sweetheart. Sir, it looks like we don't take your type of medical insurance here. - Ray... - I'm sorry. If you call your provider, they can give you a list of qualified... A list? I don't need a list. I need a doctor. This hospital's admission policy requires proof of coverage. Whatever it takes, I'll cover it. Okay? You do take cash here? You got an ATM? You take cash? I will have to check. Excuse me. This is insane. I can't believe this, can you? She's sitting there going... "Your shoe size?" Mommy? - He doesn't have... - Did you find my compact? We didn't, sweetheart, but I'm gonna buy you another one soon. Everything's fine, Mr. Monroe. - You're good to go. - Fantastic. Nurse Anne will get you situated. Okay. - Hi, is this Peri? - Yes. - We'll get you taken care of right away. - Yes, another one. - Come on, baby. - Sit in the wheelchair for me? A walk-in. Six-year-old female, unknown blood type. Let Dr. Berthram know. Kirkbride serves three counties, so it can get quite busy. And EMS just brought in a couple of head traumas - so it's backed us up a bit. - Yeah, I saw that. What happened? A couple of teenagers. Head-on collision. It was a drunk driver. That's horrible. They all right? As I understand it, it's touch-and-go. Do you have to do that? He's in a lot of pain. I just need to know where he's hurting, okay? Okay, sweetheart. There you are. Okay. Doctor will be right in. Hey, baby. Hey, just keep that arm in your lap, lay back on the pillow. - Won't be long. - Better not be... or I'm gonna break somebody's arm. Not mine, I hope. Hi. I'm Dr. Berthram. Hi. - You must be... - Peri. - Peri. - I'm sorry, I didn't mean to... No, no, no, it's quite all right. Sometimes I've gotta crack a few heads myself around here to get anything done. So, Perry Mason, what can we do for ya? Monroe. Peri Monroe. Oh! Yes. I see it now. Yes. Peri. And that's P-E-R-I? It's short for Periwinkle. Isn't that sweet? It's my mommy's favorite shell. Okay, sweetheart. Let's let the nice doctor do his job. It's all right, I'm not that nice. So... what's the story, young lady? I fell. Oh, dear. Yeah. Well, sooner or later, everybody does. Right, Dad? So, Peri, I'm gonna see how that arm is doing, and if anything hurts, anything at all, I want you to let me know. Deal? - Deal. - Okay. Where did this happen? - It's a gas station a few miles from here. - We're on our way to Minneapolis. Visiting Grandma and Grandpa for Thanksgiving, I bet. Uh-huh. - All right, so you were at a gas station? - Yup. Yeah, off Route 20. I know. I'm sorry. Uh, there was a dog, and it scared her. A dog? Uh, it was just an accident. You didn't say anything about a dog. Did that hurt when I touched here? - Yeah, I know, sweetie. That's an ouchie. - Uh, it doesn't matter, she just fell. And I nearly had you, didn't I? So, sweetheart, when you fell, did you hit your head, Peri? You did? You know, you are a real trooper. You think it's broken? I think the swelling is consistent with a fracture along the distal radius, but we'll get an... we'll get an X-ray to confirm that. - She need a cast? - We're going to put her in... You're a brave girl. Yeah. I don't think they're gonna have to amputate. - Yeah. - I'll tell you one thing. In a few weeks, this arm is gonna be as good as new. Now, look at my shoulder. Peri, look at my shoulder. That's right. My shoulder. That's right. Uh-huh. Most beautiful eyes I've ever seen. Now, Peri, Nurse Anne is gonna come and give you some medicine for the pain. I gotta talk to Mommy and Daddy here for a minute. Um... ibuprofen. Check vitals please. Uh, this way, guys. Okay, baby. I'm concerned about a possible head injury. There's no reason for alarm. It's just I'm not seeing the pupil dilation that I like. Since you're traveling, I'd like to do a CAT scan just to rule out anything internal. But she seems fine. And I would agree with you, but on the off chance that it's bleeding around the brain, what we would call a subdural hematoma, now that can be quite serious. A head injury like that could lead to confusion, seizures, even the possibility of slipping into a coma. We've... We've heard enough. Do it. Yeah, but you need to know... it is a costly procedure. I would do anything for my family, so you do what you have to do. Make sure she's okay. That's a wise choice. You know, that's a pretty nasty little scrape you have yourself. - Should I take a look? - It's nothin'. I'm a tough guy. Okay, well, give me a minute to get things in motion for Peri. Yeah. She's all right, isn't she? Yeah. Yeah, you heard him. It's nothing. It's just a precaution. It's better to be safe, right? We'll be fine. We will, Ray. We'll be fine. Wow. Look... look at that. This goes over your head right here. You're being so brave. We're almost done, and we get to go home soon. He's going down to the lower level for an appendectomy. It looks like you're feeling better. Hey, maybe we should get a motel like the old days and pick up the drive tomorrow. That's the best idea I've heard all day. My head is killing me. Maybe they have a hot tub. Hello, Peri. Nurse Anne and I got this for you for being the number one patient of the day. Oh! Ah, look at that. Thank you. That's so sweet. No problem. - I hope you feel better. - I'm Bruce. And I'm gonna take you downstairs so we can take a little peek inside that little noggin of yours. Okay? - Okay. - Okay. You know, you must have made quite an impression on Dr. Berthram. He does not crack a smile for just anybody. Yeah, she's a real charmer. Dad here must have to keep a shotgun handy to chase off all the boys, am I right? All right, keep your arms and legs inside the vehicle. Mm-hmm. So, this is a... a more restricted part of the hospital. I can only take one visitor down with a patient to the lower level. - Okay. - Sorry about that. Hey, you go. You sure? Yeah, I'll be fine. Okay. Hey. I'm gonna wait right here for you when you get out. Actually, you might want to wait out front. Yeah, scans can take a while, especially if they're backed up. Okay, then. I'll book that motel. Daddy, can I have a pizza? Yeah. - With extra cheese. - Extra cheese. Yeah. I love you, Daddy. I love you, sweetheart. You did good. Okay. Okay, okay. We'll see you in a few. Yeah. Yeah. Next year, we fly. How about next year, we stay home? Daddy! Next time, we fly. Hey, buddy, you all right? You were talkin' in your sleep. Well, suppose somebody came along and offered you a million dollars for your life. Would you take it? John, don't even talk like that. Do you mean I'll be... dead? No, I'm fine. Well, not me. I wouldn't take it. Your life is worth more than a million dollars, so don't bet it on getting around in a car in order to save a couple of minutes. The gamble isn't worth it. The stakes are too high for what you can possibly get out of it. - It still hurts. - Excuse me. I think my baby has an infection or something. He won't stop crying. Okay, how long has that been going on for? A couple of days. Okay, um, well, I'm gonna get you to sign this form. If you'll just take a seat, sir. Thank you. How may I help you? Do you know how much longer it's gonna be? Sir, I'm gonna need a little more information than that. My daughter, Peri Monroe, she went for a CAT scan with my wife. Okay, so she checked in before? Yeah. All right, morning shift would have taken care of that. I don't have the imaging schedule, but it can take a little while. Yeah. They told me that, I just... You know, I know my kid. She's gonna be hungry I just wanna check on her. As I said, sir, I don't have that information here. It's been hours. And if you just take a seat, I'm sure she'll be out shortly. Cardiology, 54-12. Cardiology. I'd like to speak with Dr. Berthram. Dr. Berthram has left for the day. But he was helping us. I understand, but he would have passed his cases to the other doctor on duty. I can have the nurse's station pass along a message to the on-duty, - All right? - Yeah. If you'll just give me a moment. - Oh, no! - Truck! I lived it again and again, like in slow motion... We're gonna hit it! It's enough to drive you nuts, isn't it? Sorry? The wait. I've seen you sitting over there. My husband went in at 6:00 a.m. Melanoma. Pretty simple procedure. Now it's almost dinnertime. Hurry up and wait. Hurry up and pay. Sometimes they hope we all just die in the meantime. Uh, what are you in for? Nothing. Call a doctor for Tommy. Call an ambulance. Excuse me. What's that? It's... Hi, how may I help you? My daughter? Oh, right, yes. I did leave word, sir, but I haven't heard back yet. Can you check again now, please? Okay, what was her name again? Peri Monroe. Monroe. M-U-N? No, M-O-N-R-O-E. Okay, I have several Monroes here, but I'm not seeing a Peri Monroe. Could she be under another name? I signed in. I signed in on the clipboard, right? It's right... It's right here. Yeah, but that gets thrown out at the end of each shift. It would all be in the system by now, but I'm not seeing a "Peri Monroe." That's crazy 'cause we were admitted. You know, you asked us for all this information. Yes, but the patient's file is always under the patient's name, and I'm not seeing a "Peri Monroe." She is a patient. She's a patient of Dr. Berthram's. - Yeah, he saw her. - Dr. Berthram has left for the evening. Yeah, I know that! You told me that! Sir, there's no need... to raise your voice. Check again. When we came in, in late morning, we did all this, and then they took her down to the CAT scan. Okay, maybe they put it under your insurance number. Can I get your card? You wouldn't take my insurance. You said that I could pay cash. - Cash? - Yeah, all worked out. The woman who admitted us, she asked. They said it was fine. I've just never heard it being done that way before. Yeah, I don't care about that because I don't make the rules. All right? Let's ask her. Let's ask the woman that checked us in. She's already gone. Then let's ask the ER, all right? Because there was a nurse named Anne, there was an orderly, his name was Bruce. There's been a full shift rotation. I just want to see my wife and daughter, and they're back there. Unless I can identify you with a patient, I... It's been a long day, and I just need you to call down to where they do the CAT scans and see if there's a woman and a six-year-old kid still there, and whether they're waiting, or if they want to come home. Can you do that, please? You're... You're bleeding. Hi, this is the main desk. Oh, hi, Tim. You better stop, or I'll make you live up to that. Um, anyway, I'm just calling about a little girl. She came up for a scan. Late morning. I know, I know, but can you check for me, please? You're bad. Bye. I'm sorry, sir, there hasn't been a scan since nine o'clock this morning, and it was for a 62-year-old woman's hip. So what are you telling me? I'm sorry, they're not here. What? What? You lost my family? Maybe you're at the wrong hospital. I've been sitting there all day. Maybe they left before you got here. Why would they do that? Why would they do that? - We came together. - I'm sorry, sir. Sir! They're not here. Would you please excuse me so I can deal with the gentleman behind you? - What are you saying? - Hi, how may I help you? My wife's been sitting over there for two hours. It's just going to be a little bit longer. Uh, excuse me, sir! You can't go back there! Drew, that man, he shouldn't be back there. Call security. What the hell? Do you mind? - I'm so sorry, I'm just looking for... - Hey! - You're not supposed to be back here. - Okay. Okay. Okay. - Hey! Hey! - All right. Enough. - Drew, what's going on? - This guy just rushed in from up front. Just... uh, my family's back here. The receptionist, she wouldn't... I don't give a shit, pal. Just calm down. What is going on here? I'm just looking for my wife and daughter. Joanne and Peri Monroe. Are they patients here? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. My daughter is. That's what I'm trying to explain. All right, all right, let's all just take it easy. Okay? I'm Dr. Lucado. And you? Me, I'm Ray Monroe. Okay, Ray... why don't you tell me what all this fuss is about. Well, we came in earlier, and my daughter saw Dr. Berthram, he... - She had a potentially fractured arm. - Okay, was she released? No, no, no. She... He was worried about a head injury. He took her to the CAT scan. Joanne went with her. - That's the last time I saw her. - This was when? Hours ago. - Monroe? - M... M-O-N-R-O-E. What a day, huh? Got the whole day in front of me here, and I'm not finding any Monroe. Well, that's insane 'cause, you know, we were here. We were right... right there. - All right... - So was she. So was she. She... She knows me. She helped us. Ask her! Ask her! Okay. Just calm down. Anne, can I see you for a second? - Yes? - Have you seen this man before? Yes. - He was here on my earlier shift. - See? He was treated for a head injury. A head injury? That's not true. I see. Why are you lying? That is a pretty nasty contusion you have there. You're lying. - Ray, I need you to calm down. - Just leave me alone. - Ray, calm down. - Stop calling me "Ray." You don't even know me. What have you done to my family? - Where's my wife, huh? - Calm down! Where'd you take my family? - Calm down! - Get off me! - Calm down! - Droperidol. Five milligrams. Get off me! - Hold him still. - Calm down! Hold him still. Ah! Settle down! We cannot have you disrupting this hospital. Hold him in four. I'll call upstairs. Oh, God. Yeah. - Hey. Hey. - Hold tight. - Get up on there. - Get off me. Get off. Yeah, you gonna keep swinging? Give me your hand. Give me your hand! Please, please. You don't need them. - You gonna behave yourself? - Yeah. It's okay. I'm sorry. It's just... Just a little confused, is all. Wipe your eyes with this. You're gonna be locked up in here until the doctor can figure out what you need, okay? Lay down, let the sedative do its work. Yeah, sure. No... Come on, wake up. Wake up. Wake up! Where is it? Come on! Where is it? All right. Hey. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Come on. Okay. Come on. Three, two, one... Oh, my God! Call security! Hey! Hey. You remember me? You remember my daughter, Peri Monroe? Your dad must have to keep a shotgun handy to chase off all the boys, am I right? Hey! Hey! You! Oh! Hey! Oh! Hey! Oh, shit. Whoa! Get out of the way! Get out of the way! Fuck! Ah! - Hey, Jeff. Jeff? - Fuck. Did you get him? Yeah, Frank, he got away. All right, what do you want me to do? Let reception know in case he thinks he's comin' back. Holy shit. Oh, God. Ah! We had a noise complaint. Two white males in a vacant lot. Looks like they may be getting high... - Hey! Stop! - Oh, Jesus. What the fuck? Help me! They've taken my family! They just took 'em, just took my family. They won't let me see them. Step back. Calm down. Then they gave me this shot and this drug, and they kind of knocked me out. - Relax. - Maybe they gave the same thing to my wife, 'cause I don't know what's happening. - I don't know what happened. - Calm down! - I... I'm calm. I'm calm. - What are you talkin' about? She's... My daughter's in there, and she's only six. Is this a custody thing? No. We came here to get help, and now they're saying that she didn't... That she she never came here. All right? They've done something. They've done something, and they're trying to cover it up. What happened to your hand? This? They locked me in a room. I had to break out. - All right. Can I see some ID, please? - Yeah. Here. Here. That's them. That's them. That's my wife. That's... That's my daughter. We were... It was Thanksgiving. We were just going home, and we stopped at this gas station, and she falls over, she hurts herself, and that's why we came here. That's why I know they're still in there. Okay. What are their names? Joanne and Peri Monroe. And I'm... I'm Ray. Okay. - You're gonna help me? - All right. Why don't we go inside and see if we can sort this out? - Would you please? - Okay. Come on. Hey, it's the front desk. Send somebody over here now. It's him. Hey, we just dropped off that OD. Yes, what can I do for you? Okay, so, now we have this man here who says that you all are holding his family against their will. - You stay away from me. - That's ridiculous. That's the guy. That's the one that put me in the room, and he held me against my will. - You know this guy? - Yeah. All right, well, he's saying that you roughed him up - and that you injected him with drugs. - Yep. No, he was in earlier and acting a fool, so the on-call doc gave him a sedative. - That's what happened. - You're a liar. I'm not lying. Why aren't you arresting his ass? Calm down. Let us handle this. Now, where did you last see your wife and daughter? It was in the emergency ward, it was ward nine. It was just through those doors. I can't believe you guys are buying into this bullshit. I mean, he's a fuckin' head case! Look at him. Want to take us to ward nine... Jeff? Today, please. Now, your chest X-rays show a slight infiltration in the right lower front lobe of your lungs... Doctor. Now do you want to tell me where my wife and daughter are? - They should've locked you up! - We'll handle this. He slipped out. Can you answer this man's question? He says that his wife and daughter are missing in the hospital. The answer is, I don't know. According to our nursing staff, Mr. Monroe came in alone, - wishing to be seen for a head injury. - Peri was admitted. Where's her file? Where's her file? Can we take this to my office, please? Gotta be a record somewhere, right? For patients admitted. I wasn't on call then. Sometimes files get misplaced or they get filed under the wrong name. Maybe it wasn't entered into the system. These things happen. You're full of shit. You should call that Dr. Berthram, all right? He sent Peri to get the CAT scan, and that was the last time I saw him. Call... Dr. Berthram. This is ridiculous. Where's Dr. Berthram? He went off call. He's probably at home. Well, if he can sort this out, it's probably worth giving him a call, right? Right? Call Gabe. Where do you do the CAT scans? Um... our imaging lab's on the third floor. Okay. Take us up there please. Take them up to three. Hang on. The CAT scans are downstairs. - No, our imaging lab's on the third floor. - No, no, no. No, I saw them get in an elevator and go down. He's obviously confused. Our lab is on three. Can you take us up there, please? This computer keeps a log of usage. There's date, time, and duration. You can see this machine was used at 9:07 a.m. for a duration lasting exactly 29 minutes. And that was the last time. Can you see this clearly, Mr. Monroe? Yeah, it doesn't prove anything. It proves no one had a scan at the time you say your daughter was here. - Makes sense. - Excuse me. You can see this, right? Yeah, she wasn't here, because they never brought her here. She didn't have a CAT scan. They just took her somewhere else. Where? I don't know. And why? I don't know. You're the detective, you figure it out. I just know that there's something wrong with this place. Dr. Berthram, who was attending this morning, will be here shortly. Good. Maybe he can clear all this up. Oh, I certainly hope so. - And there you go. - Thanks. - What's your name, baby? - Anne. Hmm. So, Anne... double shifts? Single gal's gotta make a living. Yes, she does. You ever sleep? What time you get off tonight? Okay, well, this is him. Ray Monroe. Found this in the trash out front. It's the morning sign-in list. Here's my name. There's my name. Ray, it's... it's your name. - I signed in for Peri. - No, you signed in for yourself. What's going on, Aaron? Anne said something about missing patients. - You know me, right? Remember? - All right, back off. All right? You saw my little girl, all right? You... You treated her arm. You... You... - Do you remember this man? - Tell 'em! Tell them, please! I do. He was here earlier today. - Yes! Yes! - All right. And what were the circumstances? We have been all through this... I'm talking to Dr. Berthram. - What were the circumstances? - Uh... He was, um... He was a walk-in, and one of our doctors, Bruce Volk, um, he examined him. He told Anne that he had been in a car accident. Uh... Uh... His behavior seemed rather... erratic. Dr. Volk asked me to take a look. So I suggested maybe doing a head CT, which he refused. He insisted on going back out to the lobby to wait for his wife. - Wh... What was her name? - Abby. Abby was her name. Thought you said your wife's name was Joanne. - It is. - Then who's Abby? She's my first wife. Where's Abby now? She's dead. She died. She had nothing to do with Joanne and Peri. Joanne and Peri? Who he claims is his current wife and child. This is real. This is Joanne, and this is Peri. Periwinkle. You remember? Because that's Joanne's favorite shell. And that's my family, and I love them. What does your first wife have to do - with any of this? - Nothin'. You got Abby's name from the insurance information, right? And you're just using it against me to make me look crazy, when, in reality, you've kidnapped my family, and you've done something to 'em. All right, enough. Enough. Okay, there's a simple enough way to confirm or deny any of this guy's bullshit. Right there. This is today's waiting room feed. What time did you say you came in with your family? Late morning. So, we'll start at 9:00 a.m. Work our way forward from there until we see you. Stop. Stop. Go back. Okay, this is me coming in, and Joanne was carrying Peri behind me. All right, there I am. Right. This is where she said wait. Um, I went back to the seating area. What are those? Those little glitches? It's an older system. Records 30 seconds out of every minute, so there's gonna be gaps. That's pretty convenient. - Well, where's your family? - They're right there. Just... Can you... They're under the camera. You can't see where they're sitting 'cause of the ch
