CTB FILM COMPANY ROSSIYA 1 TV CHANNEL WITH THE SUPPORT FROM THE RUSSIAN CINEMA FUND THIS FILM IS BASED ON THE EVENTS OF THE 1985, SALYUT-7 RESCUE MISSION Welding in silence feels strange. I like the sound of it. Sheekh-sheekh-sheekh... You do a good impression of it. That's a nice weld. Yes, but molten metal is spilling out on the other side. Can you see it? Yes, I can see it. I'll take a couple of historic photos. Svetlana, smile for posterity. You look great. Guys, time to get back inside. You're 4 hours and 10 minutes into the EVA. - Any word from Zarya? - We'll have signal in two minutes. Alright, we're wrapping up. I wonder, if people ever have to leave Earth, would they be able to live in space? To procreate, raise their children, sustain themselves, fall in love? Make love in outer space... They might conduct such an experiment someday. Why not? They'll invent a simulator to train cosmonauts for... love. Cosmonaut Ivanov spends a record amount of time in the simulator, - setting a new space record. - Stop it, guys. Comrade cosmonauts, stop fantasizing. You're doing a welding job on a space station, remember? Zarya, we already finished. Return to the station. Do you have much oxygen left? Enough for 15 more minutes. That was awkward. I thought you couldn't hear us. So did I, but I'm glad cosmonaut Lazareva got an opportunity to personally present a new idea to management. We accept it for consideration. Training starts next year. Comrades, the first female spacewalker is joking and talking about love. I'd applaud cosmonaut Lazareva. The entire MCC is applauding her. - Ouch! - What happened? Svetlana, don't move. - What happened? - My glove got punctured. - Don't move your hand. - I'm trying not to. A welding burr went right through the glove and got embedded in it. - Check the pressure. - It's dropping. Stay very still. - Vladimir, can you cut the burr off? - I'm on it. - What's the pressure? - 0.7 atm. It's alright. Give me your hand. Now, walk with me. Imagine we're strolling down Arbat Street. We're passing the House of Books, across from the restaurant Praga. Now we turn into the boulevard. Svetlana, talk to me. I'm talking to you... - Vladimir, you have two minutes. - That's enough time. What's the Latin name for 'silver' used in the periodic table? - What? - What's Latin for 'silver'? - Argentum. - And for 'quicksilver'? - Hydrargyrum. - Right. I always get them confused. - I can't see you. Where are you? - Just around the corner. Are we going to the cinema? Of course we are. We're almost there. Today they're showing The Autumn Marathon. - Are you getting in? - Yes, we are. - Do you like The Autumn Marathon? - I like... The Autumn... That's the spirit. After you, dear. Atta girl. What's the pressure? Are you getting in? Lazareva? Fyodorov? Do you read me? Copy! Guys, are you inside yet? What's the matter? SALYUT-7 I can't use any laws of physics to describe it. Vladimir, think about the absurdity of the situation. Cosmonaut Lazareva nearly died because you saw a light that obscured your conscious function. If I put that in the report it would severely undermine your career as a cosmonaut. What if I saw angels? How's that for an answer? You're joking, right? If I was joking you'd be laughing. BANNED FROM FLYING When you flew over the Soviet Union, did you think about Olya and me? Uh-uh. Every time? Every time. Really? Sixteen times a day? More often than that. I didn't think of you only when I flew over Madagascar. What did you think about when you flew over Madagascar? I wondered what would happen if I land there from space. The locals would probably see me falling out of the sky, find me, and make me their king. I'd tell them stories about space, about stars, about the Universe, and a little bit about what my life was like in the USSR. What was your life like in the USSR? Tell me. I love you. I want you to get back to normal life on Earth. I'm trying to. How did that happen? Vladimir, here on Earth objects fall down. - Let's go inside. - I feel so embarrassed... The signal disappeared. I get an error! The telemetry system is down. - So are the temperature sensors! - And the radio electronics! And the batteries! I can see it, all systems shut down. Keep calm. Reload the system. LOG OF SALYUT-7 - Here's the last data we received, sir. - Thank you. - How long has it been? - Three hours and six minutes. Come, let's have a meeting. Valery, here are some photos from the telescope. Can't tell if it's Salyut or not. - What if the U.S. shot it down? - Yeah right... What about their SDI, the 'Star Wars'? Are you calling the MoD? No, cancelling tomorrow's BBQ... Operator, put me through to the Ministry of Defense. The Soviet Union has lost control of its orbital space station. Salyut-7 is now an uncontrollable space object weighing 20 tons. According to specialists, the station will soon start rapidly descending. Right now it's impossible to tell where Salyut-7 is going to crash. When and where this Soviet space station will fall from space to Earth? There's a good chance this space station will crash in the United States, and it could happen anytime. Experts are saying the station could fall on any city. If the station falls in a populated area, multiple casualties are inevitable. We hope the Soviets take care of the problem by themselves, but in case they can't do it in time, we're working on a solution of our own. Comrade Shubin, please explain how, in the midst of the Cold War, can we lose the key strategic facility in space? We're working to determine what happened. Does that mean you don't know what should be done? We do. We have to go there and see. So when are you going? The station will be in orbit for three more months. We have time. - No, we don't have time. - What's the rush? We have information, that NASA scheduled to launch the Challenger on the 30th. That's 22 days from now. Have a look. This is our space station, Salyut-7. Weight 20 tons, size 15x6 meters. Now, this is the U.S. Shuttle Challenger. Its cargo bay size is 15x6 meters, payload capacity 20 tons. What a coincidence, right? Here's another fun coincidence. The new member of the Challenger crew is our French comrade Patric de Bonnel. He went to Salyut-7 together with Vladimir Fyodorov. They're still friends, de Bonnel even mails him chestnuts and stinky cheese. Patric knows Salyut-7 as well as our guys do. If the Americans seize our station, would that be seen as an invasion? Yes, and we would have to retaliate. Valery, you do understand that we can't let the Americans intercept Salyut-7. If you don't send someone there, we'll be forced to shoot it down. But the debris from the explosion would destoy all satellites currently in orbit, that would set us back at least for 10 years. Nobody has ever docked to an uncontrolled object in orbit. We can rush it. Get the crew ready. Fifteen years ago today, the first space station Salyut-1 was launched into orbit. Its newest modification Salyut-7 successfully operates in low Earth orbit. It's work continues as planned in automatic mode as it's currently uninhabited. All systems are operated remotely from the Mission Control Center. The station is rotating on two axis, at about one degree per second. - How do you dock with it? - Fyodorov would do it. Only Lazovoy, Fyodorov and Plakhov have ever done manual docking. Astakhov's had lots of training. Let's stop guessing, put them in the simulator, and get them trying to dock with a rotating station. You're right. Valery, call in Fyodorov. Fyodorov's been banned from space travel by the medics. We'll try others. - The fish aren't biting today. - They probably went into hibernation. Let's have a drink so we don't go into hibernation as well. Great idea. Victor! Comrade Alyokhin! You're urgently required to report for duty! Coming! - Well, I guess that's a wrap. - What's the urgency, I wonder. I probably passed the medical. Put away your fishing rod, please. You didn't tell me about the medical. What's there to talk about? I pass it every time, but they always place me on a backup crew. - Come on, you thought I'd envy you? - That too, to be honest. Are you kidding me? You thought I'd feel bad if they chose you and not me? You think I need your pity? You're not even a real cosmonaut. You've never done a spacewalk. You're just an engineer in a spacesuit. Cheers. - Hi, Victor. - Hello. - How far along is your wife? - Thirty-one weeks and three days. - No, four days. - Four... Four days, yes. - So, you'll be a dad soon. - Yes. Victor, we put you on the crew. Thank you. We want you to go to Salyut-7. - I'm ready. - This won't be a routine visit. - Something happened? - Yes, Victor. We lost contact with the station. The reason is unknown. You built it, so you know it better than anyone else. - Who's the commander? - Who would you rather fly with? With Fyodorov. Gene, you need to move in slowly, match the station's rotation and dock with the port... Valera, if I dock, you are buying me a bottle of cognac. - If you dock I'll buy you a whole case. - That's a deal. Docking... Damn it... - Gene, don't rush. - Let's try again. Here's a micromodel of the station's rotation. In order to dock, the ship has to match the rotation precisely. Theoretically it's possible, but not in practice, I'm afraid. Come on, come on. If we remove one seat, the ship can carry more fuel, water, and food. Every ounce counts. Less crew, need less food, water, and oxygen. And there'll be fewer victims in case of failure. Guys, it's impossible. Can't be done, Valery. No chance. Imagine you want to park a car in the garage. Here's your car. The garage gate is here, but then it moves here, and so on. Be gentle. Imagine you're dealing with a woman. Valery, I've never dealt with a woman rotating on all axis. I don't think anybody can do it. Who's the next commander we can try? I've run out of commanders. We gave everyone a try. Hey, Vladimir. - Hey there, Valery. - How's it going? - Fine. How are you? - Not too bad, I guess. Have you heard about our struggle selecting a crew to go to Salyut? About the docking issue? Yes, I've heard about it. Do you think it's even possible? - Is it rotating fast? - Yes. More than a degree per second, on all axis. Valery, you're a pilot. You know the answer. Alright, it was good to see you. I'm off to teach the new generation. Vladimir... What if I asked you to go there? Things are very complicated. Works for me. Your medical is tomorrow morning. I'll just replace a light bulb and fly back to you. Can't they send somebody else to replace a light bulb? I'm the best engineer there is, you know that. They wouldn't send the best engineer just for that. - Sweetheart... - You're hiding something from me. What do you think I’m hiding? That something happened there. Something serious. And that everyone else refused to go, except for you. Remind me, what should pregnant women avoid? Stress. - And you are? - Stressing. So you should stop stressing. Please calm down. Here, take these with you. - To space? - Yes. - I'm not going on a skiing trip... - Don't argue with me! Yes, ma'am. Two warm hats. Come here... Can we have the menu please? - Gorbachev is introducing prohibition. - I know. Just a splash for me please. What's the occasion? Victor and I are flying to Baikonur tomorrow. Are you kidding me? - Going to space in a week. - But you're decommissioned. Things happen. They can't manage without me. The mission involves manual docking. I'll be alright. Don't worry. Screw you! Nina... Tell me, what's so good about your goddamned space that you love it more than your wife and daughter? The Soyuz spacecraft is ready for launch. Transfer to onboard power supply. Copy that. Third stage umbilical mast retracted. Copy that. Ignition sequence start. Run one. Purge. Run two. Safety valves closed. Vents closed. Engines on. Core stage umbilical mast retracted. - Start. - Ignition. Preliminary. Intermediate. Main. Liftoff. Look at it go. Beautiful. Thirty seconds. Altitude is stable. Oscillations? Oscillations persist. The going is rough but sturdy. Yaw, pitch and roll within norm. Launch vehicle control system parameters within norm. Launch escape tower jettisoned. First stage jettisoned. Side booster engines shut down. Side booster engines jettisoned. Spacecraft attitude is stable. Pamirs, what's that thing dangling in front of you? Zarya, it's the Olympic Bear my daughter gave me. - A talisman? - Zero gravity indicator. A good luck charm... Nose cone jettisoned. Main stage jettisoned. Main engine shut down. Third stage jettisoned. Well, guys, you're in orbit. Congratulations. Congratulations, Zarya. Today, at 7 a.m. Moscow time, the Soyuz T-13 spacecraft went into orbit... Daddy's in the sky. The crew will dock with the Salyut-7 orbital complex, and carry out planned research and experiments for the benefit of the world and all the Soviet people. In other news, Khabarovsk Komsomol... - I can't see it yet. - It's still in the Earth's shadow. It'll be on your right, at 90 degrees pitch and about 10 degrees yaw. Understood. Still no... There it is. I see it. Can you turn the ship so we can have a look at it? I'm taking aim. There's our beauty. We see it too. Go for it, guys. We're 1,600 meters away, it'll take us 5 minutes. Approach it to the distance of 200 meters and cut the engine. Copy that. - Time to drop the speed? - Not yet. Reducing lateral velocity now, at a rate of two meters per second. Zarya, can you see it? Yes. Its pitch rotation rate is about 1.5 degrees per second. That's above our estimate. Can you see the solar arrays facing different directions? Yes, we can see that. - What do you think? - Can't tell yet. Any ideas? - We'll need photos... for analysis. - We're taking them. Pamirs, be frugal with the fuel. You only have three docking attempts. Understood, Zarya. - We also need fuel to get back. - Well, God be with you. Pamirs, proceed with the docking. Let's go. - Going for the rendezvous. - Extending the docking probe. Distance to port is 32 meters. Attempting to dock. Pull away or we'll crash! No contact. - Pull away! Pull away! - I'm on it, calm down. - Did you bump into it hard? - No, at very low speed. Pamirs, you're about to go into radio shadow. Get some rest while we have a think here. Stand by. - Copy that. - Standing by. We'll do a fly-around inspection. If the last 11 meters we move at 35 cm per second, that'll be exactly a quarter of a turn, and we should be able to catch the port. - What are you doing? - Aiming. Getting the right speed. It was your idea, wasn't it? - We don't have the go ahead. - That's fine. We'll just rehearse. You heard the instructions. - Let's do a fly-around inspection. - Sure, fine. The station's rotation about its long axis is stable. The proposed docking speed is 15 cm per second. That's not enough for the ship to match the station's rotation. Let's try to match the rotation. Find our range, so to speak. Check the readiness of the docking system. Victor, this is just a rehearsal. Plus, we'll look at the station up close. Their speed should be increased three times, not reduced. At least to 35 cm per second. - System ready? - System ready for docking. Let's go for it. Distance 110 meters, moving at 34 cm per second. Now at 35 cm per second. At such speed, if they fail to dock they'll crash into the station. At 35... We'll lose the ship. We have to abort the mission, damn it. This is dangerous. I know, Victor, but right now every centimeter counts. A bit off to the right, left, up or down and we'll fail... Understand? - We're risking. - Easy, easy, easy... Come on, sweetheart, give me a kiss. Slow down, we're about to crash! We have contact. We have mechanical capture. Let's begin latching. Victor? We can relax now. Why waste time flying around? You're a crazy psycho. But we docked. I refuse to continue this mission with you. Victor, do you have a choice? Valery, we have radio contact. Pamirs, do you read me? Zarya, this is Pamir 1. I read you loud and clear. - How are you feeling? - Excellent. Pamirs, listen, we had a discussion here, and... Do you have the picture yet? Not yet. We docked. Excuse me? The Soyuz T13 spacecraft successfully docked with the Salyut-7 space station. Latching is complete. This is spacecraft commander Pamir 1 reporting. I'll be damned... We're ready to test for pressure leaks and transfer to the station. Do you read me clear, Zarya? Over. You guys are incredible... We didn't have to worry. You should change your shirt. Congratulations, Pamirs. You've done great. But from now on, let's work as a team. - Yes, sir. Understood. - Prepare to transfer to the station. We're in the airlock. All good here. Ready to enter the station. I open the hatch? - Valery... - Wait, guys. Victor, do you know how Americans say 'wait'? Wait up, bro! - Pamirs, come in. - Zarya, we read you clear. Over. Pamir 2 enters the station. Pamir 1 stays back. Zarya, why can't I go? - Can't do. Pamir 2 enters alone. - Guys, we're going in together. Vladimir, if something happens to you, Victor won't manage to dump the station into the ocean. This is a necessary precaution we must take. Yes, sir. Close the hatch, Vladimir. Do it. Guys, if things go wrong with me, dump me into the Indian Ocean. I've always wanted to go there. Coconuts, bananas... - Save coconuts for later. - Yes, sir. - Open the porthole a crack. - Opening. Pamir 2, what's the pressure? 670 mm. It's hissing a little. Pressure's dropping. I'll open it a bit more. 550 mm and dropping. - Valery? - What? - It's critical. Don't proceed. - Proceed? Copy that. - Close it! Close the hatch! - Victor... - Victor! - Pamir 2! Zarya, I couldn't hear you from the pressure change. Pamir 2? - Victor, where are you now? - This is Pamir 2. I'm inside the station. The pressure is equalized, but there's ice everywhere. - Meaning? How come? - Are you sure it's ice, Victor? It's really cold in here. What are the readings on the meters? - The pressure gauge reads 530. - I see. Try turning on the light. Talk to me. Did you turn on the light? Pamir 1, Vladimir, come in. It's freezing cold in here, brothers. - Are you inside the station? - Yes, I am. - First impressions? - There's snow everywhere. You're joking... What kind of snow? Just regular snow. Up to a centimeter thick. Guys, check inside the panels. There's ice inside. The station is one giant freezer. But where could the ice come from? I think the water tank blew up. What's the temperature like? No idea. The electronic thermometer is useless. Spit on something. - Did it freeze? - Yes, it froze. Did you spit on the window? He spat at me, but missed. Pamirs, return to the ship and get some rest. You haven't slept in 24 hours. Yes, sir. Home sweet home. "Welcome". Did you write that? No, Svetlana did. Well, comrades, any thoughts? - There's nothing to think about. - The station is basically scrap metal. They can try to recover it if there's time. To thaw out the station, they would need at least two days. When the ice melts, the equipment will all be wet. So they'll have to dry it out. And then what? Check all the electronics? Alyokhin knows the equipment like the back of his hand. - They have a 10-day food supply. - Great, 10 days should be enough. They won't last 10 days. They'll be working in a freezing temperature. They can always get warm in the ship... The hatches will be open to allow oxygen to enter the station. Given the temperature difference, the ship will cool down very quickly. They won't last a week. No Russian man is afraid of the cold. - Valery, you're Russian. - And? Imagine we lock you in a shed in freezing winter, and gave you frozen food. How long would you last? A day? Five days? Pamirs, come in. Zarya, we read you clear, over. Good morning. We had a discussion and concluded that we should dump the station into the ocean and bring you back. Zarya, since we're already here, give us at least two days. Two days won't be enough, and the risk is too high. Valery, hear me out. If you were here in our spot, would you just come back to Earth? - "Two days". - Valery? Pamirs, here's the deal. You have five days. If by day six, we don't have a solution, you dump the station and fly back home. Yes, sir. Understood. Over and out. This week, as it was announced, the Russians sent a special rescue mission to save the dead space station. - Do you have airflow? - Yes. I'm breathing fresh mountain air. The U.S. specialists say there is a little chance they will succeed. Crazy cold... Because it demands a level of technology far higher than the world has so far achieved. Natasha, have a look. With every orbit the temperature inside the ship drops 0.2°C. I want all the news reports to mention that our cosmonauts are going well. The experts say the operation is likely to fail. I'll see to it. This means, the astronauts will lose their lives. - I doubt Americans will be convinced. - So, we need to be extra convincing. The orbit of the station covers the entire U.S. territory. It's possible that the Soviet station has weapons on board, perhaps even nuclear. If the collision occurs, the consequences could be compared to the damage done in Hiroshima. It might look like this... Comrade General, the Americans are about to launch the Challenger. With an empty cargo bay. Zarya, we'll connect the batteries directly to the solar panels, and re-orient the station towards the Sun. That way we can charge the batteries and heat up the station. The station's volume is 80 cubic meters. So, 40 watts per cubic meter, that's 3.2 kilowatts. We'll get half of that, at most. It'll take at least a day to get the temperature up to 3°C, and it won't get warmer than 5°C, unfortunately. That's like Sochi in winter. Not too bad. Commencing re-orientation. Too far. Turn left! Victor, I'm not driving a car here! Left relative to what? To the Sun, of course! And slow down a bit. - Stop! Brake! - Done. It's working. Feel it. It's warming up. Well done, engineer... In a spacesuit. Holy crap... That's pretty. It's cold. Let's try something. That's more effective. Don't let any water get inside the ship and short the equipment. We're on it. I'm the striker, Victor's the goalkeeper. We'll blow all the water to service module, then collect it. I wish we had a few helpers and plenty of rags. I'm afraid we can't grant your wish. How about some music to boost our mood? You'll have music in a minute. As for rags, just rip up some clothes, there should be overalls, lab coats etc. Vladimir, how much water is in there? Valery, how should I put it... Obscenely much. I see. Here's some music for you. - Can we listen to something else? - Come on, we were just kidding. - Now that's we're talking. - That's much better. - Vladimir? - Yes? - Let's test the ventilation. - OK. I think it's dry in there. Uh-oh... Victor, close the hatch! Now! Close the hatch! Goddamnit... Pamirs, did you collect the water? Almost all of it, but we're running out of rags. We even used some of our own clothes. Is it warm inside the ship? Warmer than inside the station. It's bearable. Check your temperature often, and take vitamins. Alright, will do. Careful, don't get sunburned. - What's your temperature? - Normal, 36.6°C. - What's yours? - Same. Victor, have a dig in that pile of bags above the couch. I wonder what's in there. - Very funny. - Go ahead, open it. How did you smuggle it in? With my experience going to space, I could smuggle a donkey. I'll be damned... Well? Let's have a drink to get warm? - What about the prohibition? - We're not on Earth, so we're exempt. But this is the USSR territory. I can't see any cops flying outside the window. I can't see any, either. Let's have another drink then. Vladimir, is there more than two of us here? A cockroach... The first one in space. So I'm not hallucinating from CO2 poisoning. What do we do with it? I'd squash it if I was on Earth. Let's not kill our compatriot. Want to have a drink with us, compatriot? Tell me, what are we fighting for? Why are we risking the guys' lives? It's just a huge 20-ton chunk of metal. It's the reputation of the Soviet cosmonautics. Yeah... Vladimir Komarov... Yuri Dobrovolsky... Viktor Patsayev... Vladislav Volkov... I think about them every day. And every time I think about what we could've done to bring them back. - That's reputation. - We couldn't have saved them. Knowing that, doesn't help me. What should I do now? I'm not there. I can't see what they see. I can only hear their voices. For about 20 minutes every hour and a half, through static. You could make the right decision. Bring them back now. Is that the right decision? They're our best men. What they're doing now is their true calling. It's an honor for them, to uphold their country's honor. The station isn't just a 20-ton chunk of metal. - Pamirs, come in. - Zarya, we read you clear. Over. How's it going? We're drying components of electric circuits. Is there much water left? Yes, seeping through the crevices. We're collecting it drop by drop. - Pamirs, did you get any rest? - Yes... Yes, we did. Go back to the ship and sleep. You can't work without rest, guys. No time for rest, Valery. There's too much to do. We should keep dealing with the water situation. That's an order. - Alright. We'll just check the circuits... - Guys, how did CSKA do last night? How did CSKA do what? Ah... we'll find out the score and tell you. - Valery... - Later. Valery, they both have high temperature. They need antibiotic shots. And hot tea. And rest in the warm ship for at least 24 hours. Darling, they're almost done. After they check the circuits they'll have their hot tea, rest, warmth... - Do you understand what I'm saying? - Yes, I do. Catch. We're about to connect a battery block to the solar panels for charging. - We have contact. - Are we re-orienting? The sun sensor has to find the Sun to position the solar arrays. Can you hear the gears turning? Can't hear anything. Too bad the stereo is dead... Everything is functional inside. We should take a spacewalk to see if something's wrong on the outside. Pamir 1, prepare to perform EVA during our next comm session. The outer hatch is open. Spacesuit pressure is normal. Great. I'm outside now. The photo of the station shows slight deformation of the sun sensor. Inspect it first. Understood. Moving toward it. - Keep left of the central solar array. - Understood. Keeping left of it. Everything looks very familiar. - Same Earth, same Sun? - Yes, they're still there. The arrays are looking pretty worn out. Like sails after a world cruise. Cosmic dust damage is normal. Keep moving toward the sensor. Understood. Moving on. The surface of the hull is corroded. Our lady's aging. Too early for that. Are you above the control module? Yes, moving to the work module. - Can you see the sensor? - Not yet, moving toward it. - Spacesuit pressure? - Normal. - Zarya, this is it. - Found it? Yes. I think this is the culprit. Victor, you were right. About the sensor? Yes. The sun sensor housing is bent and pressed against the hull. What could've happened? - Any marks on the hull? - You bet. I wish you could see it. There's a dent three fingers wide in front of the sensor. An asteroid? What else could it have been? Looks like a fender bender. Can you unscrew the housing? I'm afraid I can't. The screw nuts are pressed inward. Can you knock it off with a hammer? I doubt it's possible. The metal is too thick. Tell the techs to re-create this on the mockup of the station. Will do. Alright, guys. We know the cause of the problem. Now we need to think of the solution. Go back inside. Since I'm already here, I'd rather continue the inspection. I have plenty of oxygen left. No point going back and forth. Have a think and let's discuss the solution at the next comm session. Do you copy? Over. Pamir, do you read me? Zarya, this is Pamir 1. Over. Victor, do you read Zarya? Victor, talk to me, over. Pamir 2, this is Pamir 1. Do you read me? Over. Victor? Pamir 2? Victor! Zarya, there's smoke inside the station! Victor! Victor! Zarya, there's fire inside the ship! Victor, put the spacesuit on! You'll burn! Victor, undock the ship! Close the hatch and jettison the ship! Do it or the station will catch fire! Hold the fort, buddy. Hold the fort, buddy. Victor! Victor! I can see you. Come in. - Why aren't you sleeping? - The question is, why aren't you in bed. Pamirs, come in. Do you read me? This is Zarya. Over. Pamirs, come in. Vladimir, Victor, do you read me? Valery, the station's still in the radio shadow. Well, comrades, it's time we make a decision. - Let's wait for the next comm session. - It's been eight hours. Because of you we didn't have time to prepare, so now we'll wait as long as we need to. Got it? It was your decision to have them stay at the station instead of bringing them back. You killed them. Stop it! I'll make sure you're held accountable for this. I don't care about your title, Hero of the Soviet Union. Twice Hero. I'll take the responsibility, if need be. Yes, you will. CNN is broadcasting the launch of the U.S. space shuttle. Should I put it on the big screen? How's this launch different from the ones we've seen? Take your seats and wait for the signal. Victor, how are you feeling? The Americans launched their shuttle. You look very tanned, Victor. Yes, we're checking. Apogee 52,555 km, perigee 25,554 km. The inside temperature is 0°C. - The temperature of the... - Zarya, this is Pamir 1. Over. - Zarya! - Pamirs, come in. - This is Pamir 1. - Pamirs are on the line! Pamirs, talk to us! - Hi, Vladimir! - Hi, Valery. What happened? It's been nine hours. We had a fire inside the ship. Victor depressurized it. We're inside the station. - Is Victor alright? - He's burned. - Is he conscious? - Yes, but he inhaled a lot of smoke. - Can you get inside the ship? - Can do. I'm worried about Victor. Vladimir, give Pamir 2, two capsules of MP24 and one BK12, every six hours. Understood. Valery, here's what I see... The oxygen supply station burned down. My guess is that the cartridge ignited. The ventilation system is out of order. Almost no air in here. Is anything working at all? I'm checking now. The CPU is dead. No reaction to commands. - Has the wiring melted? - Everything in here has melted. I'm afraid we won't be able to dump the station into the ocean now. We have no control of the ship. Understood. We'll think of the way to bring you back to Earth. We can't let the Americans seize control of our station. Of course we can't. We know what they want. We can't let our latest technology fall into the hands of the Americans. So, we should shoot Salyut down before they get there. Comrades, are you aware that our cosmonauts are still there? What can you do about that? Give me three hours. - Did you open the control unit? - I did. It's all melted inside. That's bad. Disconnect everything before the batteries get drained. I'm on it. - You hear that? - Hear what? Did you hear the sound of docking? Victor, what are you talking about? We have to open the hatch. It's the shuttle. Victor, what the... The American ship. I saw it! They'll take us back to Earth! Victor, are you crazy? They can't dock with us! They did. Victor, no! There's nothing out there! Don't open the hatch! Get away! I heard the sound of docking. You imagined it! You're hallucinating from lack of oxygen and from the painkillers! Let go of me, bastard! I don't care if you want to die, but I want to live! On Earth! You hear me?! - Let go of the handle! Don't open it! - Get away from me! - There's no one there! - Get away! You just imagined it. It happens. I also once thought I saw angels... where there were no angels. Remember you brought chestnuts to my party? Yeah. What's so special about them? I don't get it. They taste like potatoes. I don't get it, either. Technically, manual undocking is possible. The explosive bolts are activated mechanically, without electronics. When do they start descend? Their perigee altitude is 180 km. In four orbits they will enter the atmosphere and start to fall rapidly. How long will it take? 67 hours and 40 minutes, with an error of 20 minutes. Where will they land? Approximately in this area. - "Approximately" in the Indian Ocean? - That's all we can calculate. - Valery, they might not make it. - Why? They used up most of the oxygen to restore the atmosphere in the station. There are 5 oxygen tanks left, each one lasts 4 hours, that's 20 hours. Plus large air mixture tanks, worth 40 hours, Plus 8 hours worth in gas masks. That's 68 hours total. Meaning, 34 hours per person. How much air will they need? Twice as much, but that's all they have... "That's all they have" and...? Get thinking! Tell Pamirs to look everywhere! Check every empty tank! Every breath, every molecule of oxygen counts! Valery, we checked everything. We can only bring back one person, and with no guarantee, given the shortage of oxygen. - There's enough for one person. - Say that again? They have 8 ampules of Omnopon. It slows breathing rate and oxygen consumption. We can bring back one of them. Who gets to live? A captain is always the last to abandon ship. That's the rule. They need to undock the Soyuz at 17:34:40. You should talk to them now so they have time to prepare. I'll talk to them from my office. Vladimir, Victor, do you read me? Zarya, this is Pamir 1. We read you clear. How's Victor? He's conscious. Can he hear us? No, he can't. Time is the essence, so I'll be brief. You have very little oxygen left. Enough for only one of you to make it back to Earth. You hear me? I hear you. Put all the oxygen in the ship and undock Victor at 17:34:40, sharp. Understood? Understood. Will do. He'll land in the Indian Ocean. A cruiser ship is on its way there. - How did CSKA do the other night? - They beat Spartak 2-1. That's good. Well, see you later. Vladimir... Forgive me. What did you think about when you flew over Madagascar? I wondered what would happen if I land there from space. The locals would probably see me falling out of the sky, find me, and make me their king. I'd tell them stories about space, about stars, about the Universe, and a little bit about what my life was like in the USSR. What was your life like in the USSR? Tell me. I had my daughter, my wife, football, and the building of communism. Yeah, sounds really boring. Compared to the view of the African continent from space. But I love my life. Nina? - Hey. - Hey. Hi, there. Did something happen? You have to talk to him. Excuse me. - Hello, Nina. - Hello. - There's a problem, so... - I know. When can we talk? They're on the line. Come with me. Pamirs? - Guys, do you read me? - Yes, Zarya. Over. Vladimir, Nina is here. She wants to talk to you. - Nina, can you hear me? - Yes, I can hear you. Thank you for this. - How's Olya? - She's here, wants to talk to you. Hi, Daddy. Where are you? - Hi, honey. - Daddy, where are you? - I'm very far away. - In the sky? - That's right, in the sky. - Are you coming back soon? - I have to finish something here first. - Alright, we'll be waiting for you. Vladimir. Can you hear me? I love you. I love you too, very much. Come back for me. It's hard enough to breathe here. Why smoke? Victor, it's time to undock. You're going home. Give yourself a shot of Omnopon every 8 hours. This way, you'll stretch the oxygen supply. You know how to undock manually, right? You'll land in the Indian Ocean, just like you wanted. Why can't we both go? Not enough oxygen for the two of us. I'm not going alone. Don't talk nonsense. Your wife's about to give birth. - I'm not going alone. - That's an order. We're wasting time. Listen, we should go outside and smash the damned sensor housing. The batteries will charge and we'll have electricity. With a working oxygen regenerator, we can wait for a rescue ship. We just have to break the housing... - With what, a sledgehammer? - We should at least try! Do you realize that, if we fail to break it, neither of us will survive? We'll tap into the emergency oxygen supply! - I realize that. - So fly home. If I return alone, how will I explain it to my child? How will I explain it to your daughter? Don't grasp the railing too tightly, or your hands will hurt afterwards. How do you know I'm grasping it tightly? Because on my first spacewalk I was doing just that, and my hands hurt afterwards. - Comfortable enough? - Yes, great. Just like on Earth. Victor, I'm spinning a bit. Secure me on that side too. - Better now? - Yes, thanks. Victor, have a closer look. Did I at least loosen it up? Looks same as before. We're about to enter the Earth's shadow. It'll get very cold. Game over, Victor. Game over. Do we go back inside or stay here? Have you ever wondered why cosmonauts always have daughters? I have. That's true. No matter how masculine we are, it's always girls. Well, yeah. Maybe that's because girls are cool. No doubt about that. I wonder how my Lilia is doing right now. Maybe she's already in labor. If I could only see my baby at least once. No, Victor, once isn't enough. You're right. Once isn't enough. We're going to shoot the station down. We did everything we could. And so did you. My dad used to drive a logging truck. In cold weather, chains would break. The lower the temperature, the more brittle metals become. If the sensor housing cools down to 100°C, we might be able to shatter it. Let's give it a try. We have time before the sunrise. Agreed. Come on... Come on! - Vladimir, it's over. - No it's not! Come on! Guys, can you hear me? We have the picture. What are you doing out there? Zarya, this is Pamir 1. Reading you clear. We're repairing the station. Actually, no... I think we just did. Two Soviet cosmonauts revived the Salyut-7 space station. Experts agree that the Soviet cosmonauts have done the impossible. The station is back to life and can now continue to receive signals. According to official reports, the station is due to receive a cargo ship carrying equipment. Once again, the Russians proved their heroism to the world. This is a great victory for global space science. Pamirs, come in. Talk to me. How's Lilia? She's doing fine. You have a daughter. Congratulations. You're a real cosmonaut now. DEDICATED TO ALL THE HEROES OF SPACE EXPLORATION Everything's neat and tidy, Vladimir? - Are we in the frame? - Yes, great. Can you exhale for me? Great, the condensation isn't visible. Now, I need you to take your hats off for a minute or so. Because we can't show you wearing hats in there. Alright, guys. If you have something to say, we're ready.
