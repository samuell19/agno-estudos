The mother of the calf Have you seen her children? I have seen them I have seen where she is On top of the Vellimalai hills Does she graze From the streams of Kattachira She drinks water The grains of some stranger Did you eat, dear cow? Did you eat? He plants seeds in fields during the day and smokes at night. Mark my words. Tomorrow, there won't be anything left in the field. Like father, like son! No good! I know what needs to be done. If it enters my field again, I will crack its head open! Mohanan hawks a loogie! It will be better if you go inside than sit here. The boar might snatch you away! Switch off the lights and go to sleep. Oh, come on, Mom! Leave me alone! The house is yet to be built. Look at her attitude. Mohana, get fish when you return! Okay. - He is beating me! - Wait! Come here. Son, this is him. It's his last resort. What? But how should we decide that he is the one? Mohana, come. Looks like sludge will be coming from here. What are you saying, Na ray an a? Don't be stupid! The bridge was fine last night. There was no rain at night either. - Then how did this fall? - That's right! Then, how did it fall? - It was shoved down! - By whom? Him! Who else! - That's also a probability! - Yes! What? Did you see him do it? Don't blabber! My bridge has been ruined, Karthyayani! - Mother, did you see our bridge? - What is this? This did not start out of the blue! What if he ends up killing me? Will you stand and stare just like this? Just calm down, Mohana! There's a road connecting your house. Why do you want to take this route? You take the road! Govind, since when did such roads begin to appear? Mohana, there is no doubt that the road's been shoved down! Exactly! Here comes Ravi! He only did it. He is the one who cheated on my child. - He looks innocent! - What? What the hell is he looking at? Looks like it has been shoved down! That's what Mohanan is also saying. The bridge has been wobbling for the past few days. It's such an old bridge. It might have collapsed on its own. Do one thing, put it back in its place. I don't have a problem. By the way, your dog was barking a lot yesterday. Aren't you aware of it? The wild boar showed up last night. - Really? - It barks at the very smell of boars. - Then? - Then what? It entered Vishwam's field and razed all the banana trees. WELCOME GOVIND SALOON Ravi! The grays are increasing… so will the rate! Go ahead! Hey! What if I go white from head to toe? Shirt… mundu… everything! It pooped again! Everything is ruined! The damn cock! Get lost! Do you think you can just walk in and ruin everything? All of them should be slain! Puppumma, will your highness please emerge? Scoop this shit, goddammit! Your shameless bird has got the platform stinking. Then do one thing. From tomorrow, request the bird to shit in the field. It might not affect you as you are also unclean. From now on, I will bathe the cock with soap every morning and evening, apply sandalwood, and then, I will perch it on the platform. You can have company! I scoop the shit, and he just swallows the egg. And then all the blame's on me! Just bugger off, you filthy bird! Are you not eating eggs laid by these hens twice a day? - You aren't that innocent either! - Yeah, right! You think only your hen lays eggs in this panchayat! I can buy eggs from the shop if I want! You just sit there and judge my hygiene and the bird's hygiene like Palattu Koman. Open your eyes and look! Mohanan built a house! He goes to work, looks after his family, and has built a house now! But there are leakage issues in our house. I just have one vessel left to put under the leaking roof! Nonsense! - Suresh… - I can't come to your home and make parotta, Ratheesh! Ask them to get it from the shop. What kind of caterer are you if you can't make 500 parottas? Alright, then. Come tomorrow. - Ten. - How much? - Ten? - Ten! Devi, we need to attend the meeting this evening. - How much did you buy? - Eight liters! Did Rama come recently? No, kid, she is still in Dubai. Really? Tell her I inquired about her. - For sure! - She bought three liters. Take it! Take it all! - Raju. - Yes. The new doctor will arrive in a week. Really? Cow shed renovation. Modernization of mini dairy unit. Holistic development of agriculture. The fund for all these schemes has been allocated. The individual schemes include plantations facing acute wild boar infestation. For two people, electric fencing has been allocated. Thaayathangadi Chandran and Ambaayithottil Pradeep are the beneficiaries. So, no fences for those who walk upon soil! What a scam! President, two fields are facing regular wild boar infestations, and those belong to Kaaneri Kittettan and Vishwettan. It would be great if you could consider them. I know, Ratheesh! In the first phase… The scheme is being allocated to those who face the damages on a large scale. We will consider them in the next phase. - Can't you talk, Father? - What's the use? According to the renovation of the uninhabitable house scheme, the individual who has received funds for fixing and repair is Puthiyavalappil Na ray an an. Oh, God! We got it! President, what's the basis of selection? When will all of us receive it? Wonderful! The scale of individual grievances is employed to make the list that decides fund allocation. What grievances? Na ray an an gets money for house beautification, but the ones who are actually facing problems aren't getting help. - What is this woman fussing about? - She is always like that! Shouldn't women get preference, President? You do know that according to the chronology of preference, she does not have any mental or physical issues. Instead, marks go to the financially poor or transgenders. If not, then the person has to be a widow. The only other probability is… For unmarried mothers. Pushpa is unmarried. But… Ravi is not her child, right? But why do we have to bear the consequences and live under a roof without drenching in rain? This is not the first time that my request has been thwarted to squeeze your people. Ravi does not have any problems. Isn't he sitting idle inside the house? Should he get grades for not working? Do you not get a three-rupee incentive for a liter of milk - from the panchayat? - Correct. - Isn't all that enough? - That's not out of your pockets, right? Don't talk big! To heck with this meeting and all the people! The legion sought by the Pazhassi Army… Were the warriors and soldiers who reigned over Maloor! Respected great heads of the Maloor district, it's your hair that I shaved off, right? Not your skulls, right? Then why do you morons behave as though nothing happened? Don't you guys ever react? When poor people request something out of sheer destitution, you come wearing the name of God himself creating trouble, you scumbag Na ray an a? If you drown the petty money that those sinners have given you for a house renovation, I will stab into your skull. Isn't it because of your wrong activities? His throat should be slit. At least this bastard will stop barking. What is the problem? - Do you not hear his rant? - What? Yes, but what's the point of getting hyper? Go inside! - Or else kill me with that knife! - Oh, God! First, the girl should be kicked! God knows why she gifted this to her father. Mic and speaker! Isn't he telling facts? According to me, Govind is the only one in this village with some common sense. Such a gossip monger! No eggs? There's chicken poop. Do you want me to boil it for you? You didn't forget that! Here it goes, the huge tusker! Tusker in the temple! Here it goes, the huge tusker! Tusker in the temple! What's up, Pramod? Sasi told me something. What was it? We need to deliver our work agenda directly to the common people through social media. Will it work? Everyone's doing it now. I didn't hear it. Let's heave together! There is a new trend of posting public meetings online. We can use the internet to tell what we want. We can also use the mic. If need be, we can also meet people directly. What exactly should we convey? Tell me that, Sasi. Member! - You are here?! - I am here. The vehicle does not need light! So… Why is nothing shining here, member? Leader, I have come up with a nice idea. Really? Renovating a house. Despite deserving benefit, the panchayat has snubbed the case. It's in my ward. As per a leader's duty, the party intervenes and renovates the house. Leader Kuyyali sponsored Equitable Jana Seva Scheme. If the plan works, we can continue the scheme with the distribution of mango and coconut saplings. Jana Seva Party's popular interventions! Beyond the upcoming elections, I see the political growth of the leader through this. Impressive! It's a good hold! We will tame many with this trap! KANHILERI U. P. SCHOOL MATTANNUR EDUCATIONAL SUB DISTRICT KANHILERI Group! Attention! Okay! Hands up! Everybody! Hands down! Okay, athletes! Those who have taken part in the events must raise their hands, okay? 100-meter race? I am a part of it, sir. 200-meter race? Okay! Long jump! Sir, I am in it. - Ravi, coming to play, right? - See you in the evening. Next… shot put! Sir! - Coach! - Why won't you pick up the calls? Did you call me? - Did your number change? - Now, don't begin with your games. Come, let's drink some lime water. What is the program here, coach? Trying to finish off a job. Right when I begin enjoying my idle time at the Sports Council, I get sent to these assessment camps and selections. The school meets are beginning. I have also been assigned four to five schools. Training. When I learned about this school, I have been trying to call you ever since, but you never pick up! What is the use of training on these rough grounds, coach? Some people made history running through these forests and hills. The ground is not necessary. Isn't this where Maloor Express took shape? Did you forget that? Captain! It wasn't sweet enough. - How much? - 34 Get down. The stop is here. Come, let's sit with the kids for some time. No, coach. I have some work. Alright, then. Dear people, countrymen, and my dear friends! The 29th Annual Celebrations of the Kanjileri Cultural Center is happening this Sunday at 5:00 p.m. at Kanjileri Government LP School ground! Dear people, in the leadership of LSF… Pushpa! Pushpa, just come here! Is Ravi not here? No, he went to the Society. Oh, I forgot that. They deliver milk to the Society every morning and evening. - Oh! Member! - Yes. Where are you running off to, Pushpa? - Stay there! - I will bring tea. No need! So, the party is introducing a new program in the name of the Equitable Jana Seva Scheme. The idea is to provide impartial services to all people. We plan to include house renovations, agriculture, and such in the first phase. He brought my attention to your case. So, I thought we could introduce the scheme from this house. But then, this is not like a panchayat scheme, right, member? If we see a pothole in our way, we might fill it up. For that, we don't have to wait for the orders from the PWD, right? Correct. - Member! - Yes. Find out what is comfortable for them, and do the needful. Okay. Pushpa, shall we leave? - Alright, then! - Okay. Sasi, it's not like we thought. There is some serious work. I will inform Ravi when I meet him. I am leaving. - Sasi. - Yes. - We should not give them time to think. - Okay. - Finish the work as soon as possible. - Deal. - Behold the army! - Behold the army! - Behold Kuyyali's army! - Behold Kuyyali's army! - Behold the army! - Behold the army! - Behold Kuyyali's army! - Behold Kuyyali's army! - Military, this is military! - Military, this is military! - Kuyyali's military! - Kuyyali's military! Lead us! - Lead us bravely! - Lead us bravely! - Lead us bravely! - Lead us bravely! Careful! Don't fall. Get down carefully. The Chenda group can move forward. Ravi, milk is required here today, right? Give that! Here! Pushpa, as we agreed, we are beginning the program. Just ask the supervisor for all your requirements. Don't hesitate. So then, let's begin this at an auspicious time. Dear people, we are at the cusp of a historic moment. A safe house is everybody's right. But what about an uninhabitable house? It's just a building! Through our beloved leader Kuyyali's Equitable Jana Seva Scheme, we are renovating this Korothu House. We can all be proud that we are all a part of the JSP Party's noble cause. For reaping the benefits of the very first move of the scheme with open hands, Korothu Pushpa and Ravi are going to be part of the legacy. Listen, they had come yesterday. They have included us in some party scheme and are renovating our house as part of it. JSP VOLUNTEER SERVICE IS HUMANITY JSP VOLUNTEER SERVICE IS HUMANITY The log is from Korothu House It is God's elephant So, pull it Thus says, Kuyyali! The lad of Korothu House Watches helplessly Dig it like a pit elephant Thus says, Kuyyali! A swarm of wasps Buzzes in front of the eyes, oh God! Thorns strewn upon the ground Pierces the feet, oh God! Is the sting hurting the house Or the human hearts in the house? Oh God, are you tongue-tied? What is this house that rises? Anybody and everybody drag in They run, they leave They droop, they lean Is this the Korothu House? Hey, there is a snake out there! They run, they leave They droop, they lean Is this the Kuyyali House? Those who cut the plantain tree When the house is burning Cry crocodile tears When somebody's mother goes mad Come! Such a good scene to watch! Those who gather to watch it are shameless Some men think it is shade When roots grow under their ass, oh God! From the roots rises the house That becomes a mad house Is it your assistant in this mad house Oh, Lord Parasheenikadavu Muthappa? It's the big meal Through the edge, corner, top, pillar Cowshed, courtyard, cooking hearth! It is a house of mayhem Those who come, those who go Eat to the fullest Kind of public house The Kuyyali House has risen! Where anybody drags in They run, they leave They droop, they lean This is Jana Seva House The house that scowls, the house that runs The house that jumps They run, they leave They droop, they lean This is the sponsored house Wake up! Come on. Wake up. Come here. Open the cement sack quickly! Open it up! Quick! No application. No marks. There was no wait. Dear people, this is a scheme. This will be history in the making. Let this plaque be a remembrance of that legacy. If there is help needed, one should feel confident enough to ask for it when he sees this plaque. Let this grow beyond this courtyard and this village! Due to unavoidable circumstances, our leader could not be here today. In the name of the leader and the party, to all who have assembled here, the public, the party workers, and all the people, I extend my gratitude! Without wasting any more time, with everyone's permission, I'd like to unveil the plaque. LEADER KUYYALI SPONSORED KOROTHU HOUSE EQUITABLE JANA SEVA SCHEME JANA SEVA PARTY (JSP) MALOOR GRAMA PANCHAYAT, WARD-13, AD 2022 "Leader Kuyyali sponsored… Korothu House!" JANA SEVA PARTY SERVICE IS HUMANITY He was there! Can't men get down from the back? Why rub and squeeze this way! AGAINST CORRUPTION AND PRICE RISE LSF NATIONWIDE AGITATION EXPLANATORY CONFERENCE JANUARY 19 EVENING 6:00 P.M. KANHILERY YUVATHARA BUS STOP So, now… You can start your next program. Must have already started. And that too how! If you were to be tamed, will you be allowed to sit here? Now, why should I keep this alone? He wouldn't be able to say I came empty-handed now. I don't need the woman or the dowry. The business is over. That doesn't mean I can't speak up for myself and have a lawyer say this! If you don't want me, I also don't want you! There is a bangle missing. I don't need it if you have saved it for the next visit. YUVATHARA BUS STOP Father! Hope you are doing well. I have given the thing to her. Now, nothing will stop you. If you both, father and daughter, begin to strut around… You rotten oldie, I will ram a knife into your gut! Did you hear me? Stop there! What is it, bro? Let's go. What is he up to? Legally, everything is over. The divorce happened last week. In that rage, he seems to be threatening us on his way out. Finally, everything is sorted. My daughter is saved. What is it, Ravi? Nothing. Just that the insurance papers haven't arrived. It's not ready yet. Will be done tomorrow. The cow is not doing well. That's why milk is less. Will the new doctor come anytime soon? I was told that he will take charge this week. - Do you have money? - I have money for tea. Color bulbs, festoons, and cinematic dance… It does look colorful! Member, the entire village has turned up! I see! Switch on ten color bulbs, and they will all gather like moths! Do they not sleep? If we decide, this can happen! Adi. The club should be locked! To hell with their art and culture! Dear people… long ago, a few of us created Kanjileri Art and Cultural Club as an excuse to gather around the board! It later grew into the art and culture of the village itself. Today, when I look back, I find that my political career and the club are of the same age. Oh, no! My goodness! It's raining! Come here! Come inside! - Get up on the stage! - Come here. Come here! Quick! Come! All those standing there, get on the stage instead of getting wet! Master, looks like the event is washed away. - It's raining, but I don't see the clouds. - Rains don't need clouds anymore! Your gaze is like that of a dainty firefly Does the stunning lightning Have that glow? The drop of affection That your eyes drizzle Does heavy rains have that urgency? How many miles did I surge Searching for your horizon Yet today, you stand At the door of the clouds You are that star The bird of agony Can it reach you one day? You, the nest of comfort At the peak of the forest tree The clouds line up as blue peacocks With myriad rainbow-colored feathers The romance fills up And scatters everywhere Yet, out of the blue The radiance of night arrives The waves too line up as blue peacocks With myriad colored feathers of water The romance fills up And scatters everywhere Yet, this is the loneliest Of loneliest rains! Dear people… A message to all of you. Kanjileri Arts and Cultural Club extend heartwarming wishes! Let it pour! Let the rain pour! Let it pour well! But hope that it doesn't become a flood! Last summer, the village on the hillside faced a scarcity of drinking water. It was too hot! What was the reason? Those who were supposed to protect this village plunder the hills and destroy the forests! Do we need the politics of a tree feller? You need to make a decision. The other day, there was an amusing incident in the village. These people rebuilt a house. And to promote it, they also erected a plaque in the courtyard of the house. And they have shamelessly written on the plaque, "Sponsored by Leader Kuyyali, Korothu House." LEADER KUYYALI Only if the foundation is strong will the house be strong. Politics doesn't include pouring fertilizer on a banana tree. It will be good if these people learn that. It is being argued that this house has been given to a non-partisan family. What is non-partisan? Someone without a job, or any contribution in the matters, and is characterless. There lives a young man in that house! He has no shame! He is like a feeble cobra in perennial flow. He swims wherever it takes him… Oh, no! The speech was at its peak. Is there no generator? Oh, yes! It's there! Ajaya, switch on the generator! Correct. Comrade! Korothu House! He is that characterless fellow! Oh, he was here! History has been recreated at the state-level running race! He is the pride of our village, Maloor's dear son, Ravi Maloor! Maloor Express! Here! Look at him compete with a jeep! Here he comes arousing the soil of this Earth! LEADER KUYYALI SPONSORED KOROTHU HOUSE The person you are calling is not answering. Please call again later. The person you are calling... - What is it doing? - Mom, take it to the sides. - It will kick you! - Careful! Come there! Here! This is the house. "Leader Kuyyali sponsored Korothu House." Are you going to fry the fish? Yeah! Looks like five to six kilos. Must be for the cat. Mom, it will destroy all the plantain. Take it away. Get some water. Why is the cock alone? Let me look at it. Must be sitting to fight! Isn't this the Korothu House? What is he looking at? Is this the Korothu House or not? Can't you talk? Puppumma? - Who is it? - Who are you? Sister? - No, I am the aunt! - Really? Did anyone call about a cow that is sick? - Are you the doctor? - Yes. Usually, we have women doctors coming. Why? Does the cow in this house not allow men doctors to touch its body? - What, doctor?! - Well… Tie the cow in the cowshed to the tree in the courtyard. We got to treat it, right? My God! Don't you have any work? No, he fell from a bike, and since then, he's been at home. Oh! Despite the accident, if youngsters don't go to work… Then the family will be ruined. In our area, a man climbed a coconut tree. He fell and broke his spine. He belonged to a good family who owned 40 acres of land. They sold their entire land for his treatment. Neither was his disease cured nor was their land saved! But because the public is kind-hearted, they survive with the help of donations. By the way, tell someone to hold the leash and horns of the cow. - Will fix this now. - And the legs as well. Come! - Looks like she is not a troublemaker. - No! Poor thing! The face looks weak, doctor. That's because I came on a scooter. Otherwise, it will have a good face. It's infected! Shit! If you cover her with turmeric, - how else will the cow behave? - You hold it! You have to be careful about wounds, and make sure the cow's tongue does not touch the wound. If a fly comes and bites it, it will be infected. So, when they reproduce, the cow tends to die without eating and drinking. See, the worms have laid eggs. They haven't started multiplying. This needs to be cleaned often. I will come often to clean it up. Poor thing! By the way, why is it written "By Kuyyali" on that plaque? Is it some disaster relief? When I stepped in, I read what was written there. Are this house and the property allocated by any central government scheme? Are you able to pay it back? How would you do it? You sit at home without any job, right? The cow was the only comfort, and that has also been infected, right? - Oh, God! - Oh! Now, there is no use frequently coming to clean up either. Oh, no! Dear Lord! Come over here. - Ready! - Come on! Let's bowl! Come on. Watch out! Got it! Play well. Awesome bowling. Hey, don't swing it, just block! What are you looking at? Hey, single! - Mankading? - What's that? Just go get the ball! If you are up to your usual tantrums, just leave! Buzz off! - Out! - Out! - Out! - Out! Out! If you play dirty, I will break your jaw! How is this a wicket? As per the rule, this is out! Bullshit! How can this be a wicket if he didn't even throw the ball? Don't get angry. Take your bat and just buzz off. What will you do if I get angry? Tell me! You'll blow me off?! - Get lost! - Hey! Hey! - You, Ravi! - Hey! You! Sponsored Ravi! Don't you dare! Sponsored-by-someone Ravi! You sit and eat what your aunt gives you to fatten up, Sponsored Ravi. Sponsored Ravi! First, go and do some job, and then come and be the referee! Good for nothing, tries to mess with me! Get lost, Sponsored Ravi! You imbecile! You sponsored-by-someone Ravi! Let go of me! Sponsored Ravi! Don't you dare! Let go of me! Sponsored Ravi! Sponsored-by-someone Ravi! I am boiling with rage it seems! Get lost, you sponsored Ravi! Children! Pushpa, you are not coming to Theyyam?! I have to go. I'll come soon. Make it fast! - Will this work anytime soon? - It will glow when switched on. Theyyam is going, alright? Dileep, just move aside. Let everyone see it. Here you are. Where have you been? Plowing the cricket field? You don't do anything on your own. Nobody should come to help either. How can you live like this without talking and mingling with people? You don't like anybody. All you do is just sit here! Dinner is ready. Eat it if you want. I will come after the function. Sponsored by… Sponsored by… What is this, a memorial? No! This is sponsored by Kuyyali! Sponsored by… Sponsored by… Sponsored by… Sponsored by… Sponsored by… Sponsored by… Sponsored by… Sponsored by… Sponsored by… Is this some kind of party office? Imagine his luck! He got such a good house! Hey, Ravi! Ravi! Shouldn't we go to theyyam, son? I came to call you. I came... Come out! Hey, little nuisance! You and your son took out the survey pole of that poisonous creature! You dog! You were here! Don't sleep at twilight! If Krishnan were here, theyyam would have danced in this courtyard. Long ago, mine and Krishnan's plantain stem lamps would run through roadsides. But now, look how colorful the roads are! Give me a kiss! Come. We will go for theyyam. Come, Ravi! Will you be able to see all of this if you sit at home? PUNGOTTU KAVU TEMPLE Make way! Move! Drop 10 for 50, 50 for 250. Drop the money! Drop money! Sweep money out! Anybody can play! Anybody! Yes! I'll give it! - 250! Give 250! - Give it to me. Here you go. Careful! - Look who's here! - Govindan seems to be in good form. Make way! Move! Give it to me! Give 750! Hey! How can you just leave like that? Drop some money and leave. I am bored with the game. Take your hands off me. There is one other game you don't know. How dare you lay your hands on me! Take your hands off me! Hey! Catch him! Catch him! Let go of me! Hey! Let go of me! Let go of me! Let go of me! Let go of me! Move away! Hey! Hey! Move! Move! Just stop it! Hey! I said, move! You!

And now, when the meat met dust, you decided to show up! You dogs! Don't you dare! The man was at the theyyam ground yesterday. He set out with a knife when he heard the dog barking. Must have come to sit and guard. What should we do? What should we do now? Can we do anything now? All of you, tell us! If we do something, won't it be unlawful? Then, who is supposed to do something? Forest department and the agricultural department? Then there is panchayat! Should I even start talking about panchayat? All these fences are being built for whom? The ones with large acres of land? We can organize a mourning rally in the name of Kuttan's demise. Move aside instead of standing there like a pole. We will mark our protest. Right, member? Correct. Something like this should never happen again here. Leader, they destroyed our plaque! What?! This is a golden opportunity. Do not act in haste. Make a clean blow. It will catch fire. Will turn into a wildfire! Member, you wait and watch. It will now start growing from shambles. Dear, this is Balan. Pavithran is his brother-in-law. Rajeev is his son. We had been to the house. We discussed all the matters. When Rajeev gets leaves, we will all come to your house. Right, master? Will you be at home? Or else, we will have to come to the Society to see you. Right, bro? He will come next month, dear! We can see then! - She would also like that. - We will come, then. Go! Nandana! Speed! Come on! Harish! Quick! Run quickly! Come on! When they show dedication, I feel embarrassed. It is not the children's fault. Parents are the problem. When we guide them to their peaks, they come up with a different plan. All the parents, Council, and Association together. It is all a waste. Go! - Master! - Yes. Please ask everything and let us know soon. Sure! Right, bro? Let's go? - I'll be right back. - I will check on them. - I'll be back. - It's good. Father! What is it? You know about Muchoor Temple, right? Of course. We receive blessings without even praying there. - Do you want to go there? - But will you go there? I will stand outside! I will take you if you want to go! Father, you can stand outside. What is the use of getting blessed without wanting it, right? I lived my life as per your wishes until now. I know you've always had my welfare at heart, but my wishes are what's best for me! Have a seat. What is Ravi's problem now? What problem are you talking about? I have been calling you for two days. Why aren't you answering my calls? If one falls in the water, it won't feel like land, I suppose! What? You will not understand all that! Nobody will understand. If you want me to understand, say it out loud! There is nothing to be said. What do you want me to say? - I don't have anything to say! - What are you running from? This is not new. It was the same in the past as well. When I decided to leave everything and come with you, what did you do? When running isn't possible, one will be forced to flee! I was a failure then… And now as well. Your father left just now! He also looks at me with disdain. - What is it, Ratheesh? - I had kept the keys here. They are missing. Where are they? I can't find them. Found them. I found them. Carry on! Do you have a problem accepting a divorcee? Oh, no! Hey! Don't hit them! Stop it! Burn it!

You coward stinkard! Go! Go and organize a protest, and get the plaque rebuilt! Even if they decide to replace your father's name with the party name, you must not delay it. - If you conspire, beware! - If you conspire, beware! - Standstill! - Standstill! - We will bring Maloor to a standstill! - We will bring Maloor to a standstill! - They who sacrificed the country. - They who sacrificed the country. - LSF's stinkards! - LSF's stinkards! - Stinkards!

Come in. Come closer! Come on. That way! That way! Sir, this is Ravi of Korothu House. Go, speak to sir! Sir! Did you run here? You could've informed me. I would've sent a vehicle. That is okay, sir. Why was I summoned? Why are you in a hurry? What work do you have? Nothing like that, sir. What? Nothing like that?! You look fat. You picked a fight at the temple ground! Do you assault kids just because you don't have a job? Go and stand there! Move! Sir! - Where are you from? - Sir, he is from the house near Kanjileri School where that plaque was destroyed. That's nice! The whole village is burning due to that thing in your house that was destroyed. And here you are. So, wouldn't he know who destroyed it? Were you present there? Tell me! Who destroyed it? Open your mouth and speak up! I destroyed the plaque, sir! If I see something that I don't like in my own compound, can I not throw it away? If it were in your compound, wouldn't you do it? It was me who smashed it into pieces. Now what? Will you put me in jail? Go ahead! Have a seat! Sit! The party people renovated your house because you agreed to it, right? That is not how it is! They did it without my permission. And then they made a plaque and wrote that my house is sponsored by them. Whose sponsorship was it? My house and I rest under nobody's sponsorship. It was me who destroyed it! Do one thing. Sit outside for some time. I will call you. Sir. The plaque… Was destroyed… By the ruling party itself! That is what you will tell the village people. If that's how it goes, then so be it! Send him home… After a couple of hours. Okay! Alright, then! Ravi! If a dog that licks anything comes to lick the mortar, it shall be handled by the big pestle! Those who are brave enough only to come out in the dark will do good to remember this! The boars entered the fields because there was no fence around them. What is the use of talking about hills, rain, and wood? If a fence is needed, a fence should be built. The fund that can build fences for ten poor people is allocated to the large acre lands of the rich men. And then, when they are questioned about rice, they talk about pulses. But we cannot turn a blind eye towards the public. With this renovated house as witness… I give my word to all of you. For the ten farmers who were abandoned by the panchayat, as part of the Equitable Jana Seva Scheme, we will build fences! Kittan is a martyr. FAREWELL TO KANERI KITTAN The martyr of the indifference shown by the ruling party towards poor farmers! Let us observe a minute of silence for the farmers of this soil. So… let us disperse as we take part in mourning with the family. Ravi… Now this has become a matter of pride for the party. If anyone dares to touch it again… We will slash the person's hand. From now on… Keep an eye on the plaque. Okay? - Sasi! - Yes! - Take care of that. - Sure! LEADER KUYYALI SPONSORED KOROTHU HOUSE EQUITABLE JANA SEVA SCHEME JANA SEVA PARTY (JSP) Instead of sitting here like this, can't you just go there? It's the house of the dead! People will gossip! Now, when will I cook rice, and when will we get to eat? Just move, you old hag! Raging up like that! Did you think I was dead here? What did you call me? You should just shut up! Do you have any understanding of right and wrong? Don't you see these dogs messing with our home? What's wrong with you? Shut your mouth! You just want everything for free, right? When did I get anything for free? I worked hard to get you to this state. Yes! That's what you think! Roam around telling this. And then climb atop coconut trees and tell the rest of the people! Then people will say that the man of the house is good for nothing. Right? Isn't that what you want? - What are you doing? - Get away! Don't you dare climb on it! I don't think I will be able to walk, coach. My leg refuses to move. If the legs stop functioning… The mind will be dead, coach! Neither can I face people… Nor can I sit at home. I am getting restless doing nothing, coach! If somebody looks at my face and asks me a question… I feel like running out of there. I can't even walk! There are a few matters regarding the state royalty of these geologists. - I have set the ball rolling. - Okay. It'll take some time. - Advocate. - Yes. Our agreement should be strong. No matter what, the environmentalists will meddle with random demands. Law has value only when there is transgression. That is right! Leader Kuyyali sponsored… Farmer Seva Scheme! So, now… Our Jana Seva Scheme enters the next phase. KERALA GOVERNMENT RURAL DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT The south of the Purali Mountains, 4138 hectares of hillside interspersed with sloppy and plain terrains as its geography… There are no landslides, floods, or storms. Almost 8000 farmers, out of which, around 7000 have land of their own. Our investment is upon them. KANERI KITTAN It is here that crops should be sown! We will farm in their soil, with their water, with their hard work. From now on, the Anjarakandi river and all the water streams will flow for us. The entire world is reaping profits from agriculture, but in reality, all the farmers are starving! Pokkan… What is the problem faced by the farmers of Maloor? Is its solution as trivial as building fences around ten farmlands? - Is it true, member? - Well… While farming, nature can lead to issues. After farming, the sale is also a significant issue. The farmers of Maloor need to be concerned only about farming. The seeds, harvest, and sale… I will take care of all of that. All of you, just ensure a maximum harvest. - What do you say, Janetta? - Yes! - Yes? - Yes! - Advocate… - Yes? Just read out the agreement of our Farmer Seva Scheme. Okay. Ravi… He is a big shot. He has a party of his own. Lots of money! What were you thinking when you destroyed the plaque? But who is not known here? This man named Kuyyali… Was just a timber dealer once. To me, he is still that same businessman! Ravi! You… Are amazing! It was that deadly accident that ruined everything. My career was finished. My woman also left. By the way, why were your so mad at me? You don't have a job. And on top of that, you're behind a beautiful woman! I thought something illicit was going on between you two. Deceit! I don't like it! Deceit! I don't like it! Hey, let's go. Shut your mouth. Let's drink, and then leave. From here on, Maloor will wake up… To our plaques. The Kuyyalis will now exist… Between the farmers and the sale. That thing killed your father. Hack and bury it! LEADER KUYYALI SPONSORED KOROTHU HOUSE EQUITABLE JANA SEVA SCHEME JANA SEVA PARTY (JSP) Smile for me. Who are you today, Korothu Ravi? To the home and homeland An overburden? Whose Earth is this, you fool? Like a tree Whose head and legs are on fire? Your insides burn Burn and fume The burning pyre flares up Upon your hollow trunk You are the wood, the forest, the spring The bow, the arrow The hunter, and the hunted! Korothu Ravi You rat in the hole Can't you see the serpent Raising its hood? Pick up the hoe Plow the field Sweep the inners, sweep the outdoors Clean it all up! Through the belly of stranger hill He who rises! The heat is soaring, it is blistering The land is burning In the downtrodden fields Those who reap lies Fire is blazing through the eyes The core is boiling Above hills that be the water A string of rain clouds The flora upon the wet Earth valley A land of greenery Where flourish Fishes, turtles, hogs, and birds Beings, fellow earthlings, humans Bodies, and wings, and all creatures That have been hacked apart Land, ocean, living beings together That have been consumed in greed Hot blood streams form And form and form and form… The blood of ancestors Blood of the Earth, rotten blood! This is a clarion call Dear citizens of our land Nature, climate, the welfare state, MSPs Floor prices, banana Havana, jibes, and bribes So many of these wolves In sheep's clothing Shameless crooked wild pigs Traitors! None of them will be Allowed to trespass upon here Dear citizens… I, Kuyyali, declare this to all of you, the thousands who are sitting in front of me today as witnesses, I talk for them and the entire country. Every fence erected by Jana Seva Party, every plaque sponsored by Jana Seva Party will each be for a soldier! A proud patriotic soldier ready to protect his motherland. Therefore, I speak with conviction. This land or its people who gain nothing from this… The pseudo-revolutionary figures need to be thrown out, for which, every priceless vote of yours need to be marked upon the symbol of the water pumping wheel, so that the brave and bold warriors of the Equitable Jana Seva Party emerge victorious! This is my request! You are the… Dear bird that breathes fire The memory that wakes up the soul The bird ready to take off The memory that flashes in madness The source of new wings The home of stormy memories In the rain, in heat In the madness of the crumbling hills Know they should The castles they build are lies Know they should, the words they scream On the streets are lies The wisdom of nature Is the only truth -This bogus wax humanity be gone -Go! Get lost! Dusk and night have gone The sun-child has come Bathed in mud In the puddles of water When his face appears Water reverberates in mirth As the deluge and clouds vanish The winds of the south come riding The summer chariot of plowing bulls As the seedlings are planted The wind winnows its way In scorching sun Awakening sweaty nostalgia Dusk and night have gone The sun-child has come Bathed in mud In the puddles of water When his face appears Water reverberates in mirth As the deluge and clouds vanish The winds of the south come riding The summer chariot of plowing bulls As the seedlings are planted The wind winnows its way In scorching sun Awakening sweaty nostalgia Amazing! Jersey-clad farmer! Farming is also an athletic practice. I figured that this outfit does not fit me at all. But when I wear this, I feel confident. I am trying to revive that old sportsman spirit. When you couldn't run, you tied a plow and ran. If we don't have schemes of our own, others will make us part of their schemes, master! Good, Ravi! Run… Dive… Climb… Fly… Run… Dive… Climb… Fly… LEADER KUYYALI SPONSORED KOROTHU HOUSE LSF LOCAL COMMITTEE OFFICE We have done all that we could. Now, it all boils down to where the people gather. First, you fostered it. And then, you only destroyed it. First, he sowed it, and then, he himself broke it into pieces. And then, it turned to rot. Its stink rests with us, and he walks away with the manure! Tomorrow, when we wake up from bed, will we have to walk through the line he draws for us? The rod meant to support the tree is growing way too much, master! Get going! LEADER KUYYALI SPONSORED KOROTHU HOUSE - Dump it! - That's enough! We can stick it near the party office wall. You! You asshole, I will kill you if you cheat me! I grew this bounty without eating or drinking. Don't you dare try to steal it from me! - With whose permission did you fill... - What are you up to? In the name of this damn scheme, these sons of bitches filled my farmland! How dare you manhandle an old gentleman! Did you fill his land, member? VOTE FOR LEADER KUYYALI When we're trying something for the upliftment of the poor… Don't be scared. Stand with us. What kind of talk is this? Is this the change that you are talking about? What is farmland? A place for us to farm! Shouldn't we see it as it is? - Right, Kelu? - Yes! But there are some advantages if we convert wet spaces into dry lands. Some rearrangements might have been done to this end. Don't misconstrue it as a landfill. Pokkan has told me that there is no use in paddy cultivation. How will the party gain from this? The suffering farmers should reap profits. Make a better life! Is measuring lands and installing survey stones part of your Farmers Seva Scheme? Ravi… As per the mutual understanding between the parties, things are done as per the farming contract drawn! Isn't it enough to see if help is being given to those in need? Really, Janetta? Is it enough to just get some help? Is it the decree that none of you should open your mouth? No way. We never asked for such a landfill. The farming is done without proper analysis of the soil or rain. What seeds have you sown in the fields in the name of this intercropping? What fertilizers are being unloaded here? Which company does it belong to? In Vishwettan's land, gunpowder-like fertilizers were unloaded. The workers working there had scabies and swelling. Does your house have any leakage, Ravi? We can consider that as well. You didn't have any complaints when we built your house. Why do you have complaints when others are getting help? Let them also get some help. Plaques will all start to crumble, leader! You are the one who demolishes during the night, right? Go ahead! Destroy it! But when it sees light, it will grow! It possesses life! It will grow in your courtyard as well. Leader… I don't need your scheme or your help. I will decide what needs to be grown on my farm! Come, Ravi. This is definitely Maloor's agricultural revolution. Farming is not just a hunger mitigation scheme. From now on, wealth should reach the hands of the farmers as well. If you can agree to all of this, then why should only you enjoy everything? VOTE FOR LEADER KUYYALI The lazy one has begun his games, member? - Member! - Yes? What are our programs for tomorrow? People shall gather at the junction. After which, the procession will begin from the junction towards the Maloor ground. There, the final encore! The procession is fine. But the finale… VOTE FOR LSF CANDIDATES LSF LEADER LEADER KUYYALI SPONSORED KOROTHU HOUSE The cheer that died down when I raised my hand… Should lap your hearts as waves. This is the cheer of happiness. This is the cheer of change. The cheer of development. What is development? A thirsty human being who cannot find even a drop of water is lectured about planting trees in hope of rain! Is this the development we are looking at? Development is a human rights issue. Development is the call of a hungry stomach. Love is the language of development. Love is development. To build homes for destitute women… To build fences for poor men… And to gather wood for the kitchens of poor mothers during monsoons. What is the fund? If water is required, it should be provided. Be it in a tanker or a bunker. For poverty, money is the cure. Kittettan who had to surrender in front of an animal in his own land… Is a reminder to all of us. A life has perished in these people's reign! The government… Is proving to be a death knell! The answer to bad mouth is wound! The legion sought by the Pazhassi Army Were the warriors and soldiers of Maloor LEADER KUYYALI SPONSORED KOROTHU HOUSE When you are in front of the voting machine, you should tear them apart with your index finger. Who the hell are you, son of a bitch?! How dare you make such a fuss! You leech off from our party and dared to touch our plaque! I will beat the shit... Hey! You! Move aside! Ravi! Beat them and drive these pigs out of our home! Get out! Run! Leave my compound right now! Everyone! Or I will break your skulls! This is my soil! I will lay myself here, and if the need be, I will plow here and then cover myself in it! Who dares to question me? Hey! You are amassing by doling out freebies and building fences. If you dare invade my land in that arrogance, I will dig your grave! And then I will install this plaque on top of it! What are we, your slaves? To beg for freebies? Look! It is on top of your struggles and poverty that he is raising his black market. And then he stands upon the corpse of Kittettan, killed by the wild boar, with his trash Jana Seva schemes! All these mountains are being drilled, the forest is cleared, and fields are filled. Do we need the mercy of such dirty money, Janetta? The attempt to invade the soul or soil of Maloor… Look! It must end right here! I am the one who renovated this house, so I know very well how to occupy it as well. - Move! - Where should we go, leader? Isn't this his compound? Isn't this his house? Aren't we the ones who should leave this place? - Leader, election code of conduct... - What code of conduct? After availing my freebies, if he starts to throw his weight around, I will burn him and his house! You won't do shit! If you are speaking about a few beams and poles you propped upon the house, then I will gather it all together and first burn you in it! Get out of my soil! Our soil belongs to us! Our house belongs to us! Our fields belong to us! Our country belongs to us! Our soil belongs to us! Our soil belongs to us! Our house belongs to us! Our house belongs to us! Our fields belong to us! Our country belongs to us! Our country belongs to us!
