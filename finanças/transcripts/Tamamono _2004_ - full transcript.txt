Lunch Box Look what you did. Because of you I can't deliver the mail on time. Aiko, are you done? Do you need a ride home? No? Are you sure? Okay. See you later. Aiko, let me take you home. It's no big deal. Get in. Come on. You want to suck me off again? Suck it, please. I have my fly open for you. See? I have a hard-on. You know I really like you, Aiko. I really, really do. Strike. Go for a strike. I was very disturbed by what you did. It was very inconvenient for the clients. Do you have something against the postal service? Did you enjoy knocking over my bike? You got me in trouble. Why me? Is it something personal? Why did you do it? You knocked over my bike, didn't you? Who did it then? There was nobody there but you. I want an apology. Are you going home? How about having a drink with me? You owe me a drink for the trouble with the bike. Come on. Buy me a drink. I didn't know that you can't hold a drink. Are you okay? Let's go for a drink. - Good idea. - Your treat, right? - I don't have any money, fool. - Me neither. - No money on me. - What will we do then? - I'll think of something. - You're such a moron. - I feel like a beer. - Me too. Why are we so poor? Hey. Ouch. Yoshio has some money. Alright. - Did you know? - Know what? Those homing pigeons. - What? Do they still exist? - Sure. What's left of them. - In the age of cellular phones? - That's what I want to talk about. Cell phone radio waves interfere with homing pigeons' instincts. - Is that true? - Sure it's true. - Yoshio, do you have a girlfriend? - What? Why? - Do you? - No, I don't. Why? Just curious. Do you know dove cookies? - Do you start from the head or the tail? - I don't really care. Some people can't eat them. - Why not? - They're pigeon lovers. Homing pigeon owners. It's me. What are you wearing? What is it, Aiko? Is this a dance? What's this? You're so good. Aiko. I've got to go. Mom will be furious. Stay there. I really have to go now. Don't move. Bye. Hey. Thank you. - So you have a girlfriend. - What? Home made lunch. No, no. It's my mom. She gets mad if I don't accept it. Really? Here. Have a bite. Is it good? You'll do anything I say, won't you? Aiko? Are you off already? Why so early? What's that? Aiko, you're a great cook. This is so delicious. You don't have to make me lunch everyday. I appreciate it, but it's so much trouble washing the box and stuff. So no more lunch. All the guys eat out. I'm embarrassed to be the only one eating at the office. I appreciate you making it, but I don't want it anymore. Stop. You're so heavy. What's this? What's this for? Keep it. I don't want it. I mean it. I really don't want to take your money. Okay. I will pay you back, though. The truth is that I could use it. - Are you still working? - Yeah. Sort of. What are you doing? You shouldn't do that. You can touch my legs. You're crazy. Touch me. Lick me. Eat me. What are these? What's this? Why do you have all these containers? Didn't I tell you I don't want you to make me lunch? Stop making me lunch everyday. You're driving me crazy. I have to go. Don't cling on to me. Let me go. Enough is enough. Aiko. I have told you before, haven't I? I don't want your lunch box. And don't show up at my work like that either. We should break up. Yes, we should. I'm in love with another girl. You should meet someone your own age. I'm a slacker. Hanging around with me won't do you any good. Let's break up. Are you listening to me? I didn't mean to hurt you, but I've given it a lot of thought. I'm sorry. Strike. Go for a strike. - Where are we going? - You're meeting my parents. - What? - Let's get married. I've already told them about us. I really like you, Aiko. You're a good girl. Honestly, you are. You're terrible. Ready? Here's your coffee. It was my husband's fault. He's such an idiot. There's something wrong with him. He can't control himself. No matter how many times he gets caught with women. I'm really sorry. Could you leave him alone, please? No more 'love hotels' Oh, you are such a reasonable person. Thank you for meeting me. I'll pay. Don't you have anything smaller? I have the exact money. 120 yen. Thank you very much. 350 yen, please. 1000, thank you. 650 for your change. Could you stand in line, please? Go to the end of the line, please. Don't give me any trouble. Hey. Stop. Stop her. She's robbed the store. Somebody stop her. Give me the money back. If I had known our affair would ruin your career... But I think you'll be alright wherever you go. I really think you're a good girl. You'll be fine. Take care of yourself. To you marriage. Knock back some alcohol and celebrate. - Why am I the only one with a pitcher? - Because you're stupid. - Let's drink to Yoshio's happy marriage. - To Yoshio. Hello? It's me, Yoshio. Remember me? Aiko, listen. I'm going to get married. I can't see you anymore. Can I come and see you for the last time? It's been a long time. Did you cook all this? It hurts. This is the last time. I can never see you again. Aiko. Aiko. Strike. Go for a strike. Strike. Go for a strike. Strike. Go for a strike. Strike. Go for a strike. Strike. Go for a strike. Strike. Go for a strike. - Do you need a hand? - No, I'm fine. I'm starving.
