If this is a life-threatening emergency, please call 911. Otherwise, stay on the line and someone will be with you shortly. This is your only chance to say what you wanna say. Is this Alexandra Nelson? Yeah, who's this? I'm a paramedic with Cumberland County Medic One. I'm here with Margaret Nelson. Okay. I'm afraid she's had a major stroke and you're the first name in her phone's address book. I haven't talked to her in, like, six years, so... She's likely to pass away in the next few hours, so, if you wanna see her, you'll want to... I can't do this. Hey. Hi. Yeah, I think you might have my mom over there. I don't know. She... She might already be, uh... dead. Margaret Nelson. Yeah, I can hold. I'm so annoyed. You're always up my ass. Can we just get through today without a blow-up? If you can stop barking orders at me... - I didn't want to get strand... - "Oh, we're gonna get stranded "because we're running out of gas. "We're gonna die on the road 'cause we're running out of gas." You don't have to be so nasty all the time. You don't have to be such a stupid bitch. Yeah. Oh. Okay, yeah. Thank you. You okay? None of your business. What are you doing here? This is my home. What are you doing here? - Jenny's room is next door. - Come on. Wait, you're a cop now? County Deputy, actually, and, uh, yeah, I'm kinda doing my job right now. I guess that makes sense. Power-hungry bully who enjoys making people feel small, hitting, punching... You know what? I just got here. - Do we need to do this right now? - I'm sorry. Wait, no, I'm not sorry, Travis, 'cause I'm not scared of you anymore. What do you want me to do? Okay? The neighbors called in a prowler. Does it look like I'm fucking prowling? This is my house. Okay, well, they don't know that. And you haven't been here in, I don't know, how many years and you just show up? Oh, that's cute. You've been counting. Just... Maybe you won't have any neighbors calling in a cat burglar if you came home every once in a while. Why would I come home, Travis? So I could bear witness to the "rags to riches" rise of Travis Kinney from a knife-hit novice to police chief? - Why are you so angry? - Why do you care? - You look like hell. - Gee, thanks. Maybe you should just get some sleep, you know, before you... - I was sleeping and then you... - More sleep. Your mom's probably already cremated by now anyway. Wait. Cremated? What? What are you talking about? Who made that call? I don't know. Her doctor? She doesn't have a say in what happens to her own body? That's on the doctor who was in the room when she died. So, take it up with him. She actually had a family plot she inherited, like, a hundred years ago. She never stopped talking about it. But I guess that's something I would know as the person she gave birth to. Uh-huh, well, she probably changed her mind. I mean, you did kind of disown yourself from everybody. Despite how you might see things, Travis, nobody owns me. And although she did take your side when you knocked the fuck out of me, I highly doubt that she spent her final days on the porch, chugging back beers and discussing her wishes with you. What do you want from me? Okay? Doctor had to have been there to hear. Are you going to get out of my way, or do I have to solve a fucking riddle? You know... the funeral home closes soon anyway, so it's probably already done by now. Pick up the ashes tomorrow. Travis, shut up and get out of my way. You're still like a cat, huh? Scratch you too much, you bite? You're still like an asshole. Ain't nothing but shit comes out. You know, we had some good times, all right? You're right. We most certainly did. And you could be so sweet. But those times you took me to Victoria will not make up for the time that you shoved me into the wall, the time that you took advantage of my little sister who was a fucking child! Okay! Yeah. - Sorry for your loss. - Fuck you! Hey. Uh, my mom was cremated here today. I know you guys are closed, but can you let me in? - Nah, it's closed. - Yeah, okay, but I've been driving for, like, 14 hours. Sorry. It's closed. I just need two minutes. We don't work here. You're not supposed to be back here anyway. - Dude, please! - Miss Alexandra? - Who are you? - Curtis Lee. You used to babysit me. - Dude, don't tell her... - Curty, can you let me in? Uh, I don't wanna be rude, but, like, can you go? Okay, seriously, what's going on here? - What's in your truck? - Trash. Yeah, it looked like a dead body. I don't know how else to explain it to you. It's trash, okay? - I don't believe you. - Calm down. Why are you so angry? - Miss Alexandra... - You need to stop calling me that, Curty. - Please. - What are you guys doing? Shit! Calm down. Calm down. - Did you fucking kill her? - No, man, I just choked her out. Get her in the truck. That fucking UFC shit works, man. You piece of shit! Fuck you! You're gonna pull a muscle. You still cry at lightning storms, Curty? Yeah, go ahead. She'll behave. Won't you? How can I misbehave when you have that totem of insecurity pointed at me? I'm secure. I'm sure every man who shot his wife or girlfriend said that right before pulling the trigger. Well, I can't apologize for every time that's happened in world history. And I'm not about to get into a gun control debate with another terrified libtard. Listen, I know that today is not normal. What's not normal about it? Men asserting dominance over my body... insulting me verbally and physically. But I haven't been catcalled today, so you might be right. I am trying to be civil here. Can we be civil? You had that pointed at me a minute ago. You need to figure out how to calm down. Maybe you should stop giving me reasons not to be calm. Why are you so angry? Gee, you wonder why? So what is it that you think that you've stumbled onto here? I grew up in this area. We're still the number one meth county in the country, right? Maybe you've been out of town, but you are in way over your head, girl. Yeah? Uh-huh, listen. There were scarier meth guys in my high school. And frankly, you remind me of the teacher who liked to put his hand down my shirt. And much like him, I'm sure you don't want any extra attention for your misdeeds. So I'm gonna get the fuck out of here... You're cute, but you clearly don't... All right. I can't let you leave yet. Unless you want to give me a ride. - You're not going anywhere. - Or what? You're gonna kill me? You're not a fucking killer, dude. Stupid girl. I fucking told you to... You fucking bitch! Bitch! Fuck! Oh, God damn it! What are you doing? - Who are you? - I asked you first. We process organs and tissue here. How about you put the gun down? How about you keep your hands up? There's no need for all this. That's what the last guy said... right before he choked me unconscious. Wait, don't touch that! You'll contaminate it. What the fuck is this? A cadaver. You said you process organs and tissues? Yes, a form of organ donation. Did you touch her? Did you put you fucking hands on her? That's necessary when processing a cadaver. - My mother. - Excuse me? This isn't a cadaver. This is my fucking mom! Technically, your mother ceased to exist when she passed away. This is really just a bundle of meat, so... You're really gonna mansplain my dead mother to me right now? I suppose not. I thought she was supposed to be cremated. Let me go. Get off me! - Back off. - Shit! - Help! - Put that down. Or else what? They don't let you two have guns, do they? - Did you know my mom was in there? - What? The woman who bought you an Xbox game every year for your birthday. She liked you, Curty. Maybe rethink your employment situation. Hi. I have a gun. Well, I don't. - Do you have a cell phone? - Sorry, not on me. - Who doesn't have a cell phone? - Uh, you? Are you okay? I mean, the blood and stuff. I'm not the one bleeding. Oh. Okay. - I'm just trying to survive here. - Me, too. So I don't want to get involved in whatever it is you got going on here. Which way is it to town? - Don't follow me. - Well, I kinda have to. You just said you don't wanna get involved. Home's that way, and this baby's gonna get cold. So, if any of those boys from the farm back there are coming after you, we'll just have to deal with that as it comes. - Wait, you know those guys? - I do. How? I do their housekeeping. - Are you gonna tell them where I am? - Probably not. - Why? - I just clean their buildings. I don't go beyond my job description. I didn't chase down shoplifters when I worked at Walmart either. And with these guys, I'd rather not get more involved than I already am. Have you considered other employment? The job market doesn't really allow me to be choosy. I got priorities here. Right. You don't have to walk so fast. You know those guys you work for? One of them lost a lot of blood, and they probably want to talk to me about that. So, yes, I do have to walk this fast. What? You want to find a phone and call the cops? Yeah, they have my mom back there. What? They kidnapped your mother? They didn't kidnap her exactly. They have... They have her body and... Oh, they got her for that. Shit. Yeah. But listen... Calling the cops, that won't work how you think. I don't know a lot about how these guys work, but what I do know, they got all kinds of people on the payroll. If the person answering 911 isn't in on it, the cop they send out will be. And there you go. So did you get there before or after they, um, you know... Before. Sort of cut up the guy that was gonna do the cutting. So, I guess I'll be cleaning up your mess today. Probably. Sorry. Girl, I used to clean motels. I've smelled smells that don't even have names. So you know these guys, if you were me, what would you do? I'd get into town, find the nearest phone, walk right past that phone, get in my car and drive as far the fuck away from here as fast as I could and never come back. Yeah. This is literally a choice between staying alive or getting dead. These guys don't fuck around. They didn't seem so tough. Yeah, the guys you saw were the local yokels. It's usually just a couple of dickheads doing the day-to-day stuff. They set this whole deal up like a chessboard with different pieces in a pecking order. Now, I don't play chess, but I know the pawn's the weakest. Saw the bishop once before though and he came across as a guy you don't wanna come at. You won't get anywhere if you try these guys again. Just go on out. You got any kids? No. Boyfriend, husband? Wife? No. No. You got your whole life laid out at your feet. Just go someplace other than here. Keep your head down and try to be happy. Happy? What's that like? I know, right? For me? It's him right here. He's my thing. My thing that keeps me from the brink. One day, his father showed up, said he was gonna take him away from me, and I'd never see him again. He recorded phone calls. Where I lost my cool. Said things I shouldn't have said. And he used that to convince CPS that I was an unfit mother. So I packed up everything I could in the car and left. Drove halfway across the country... 'cause he's my thing. The only thing. Without him, what's happy? Beats me. I've never really been happy. And last night, I was convinced nothing ever would truly make me happy. I was ready to quit. And I know those feelings don't just go away if you don't end up... pulling it off. I'm glad you didn't pull it off. Thanks. Me and my mom hadn't been on speaking terms for a while, so I never really considered what would happen if she wasn't around until... she wasn't. I still don't know if I have the words for the feeling, but I know if that feeling wasn't there, then I'd be sitting there, right back to where I was last night before I got the call. Going really hard at pulling it off. Okay, so this is your thing? Yeah. Right now my mom is my thing. Just like that cute little dude is yours. Yeah. Hold on a second. Here. Blood is not your color. I'd offer you a ride, but, you know. Yeah, I know. So just go down there, take a right and you'll hit Hedwards Road and you follow that down to the pits. I know the area. I smoked Escobar levels of weed there in high school. Yeah, I feel like I got to say it. Get in your car and drive away. Forget about all of this and just go. Oh, hey, hey. Hey. Hey. Hey, it's me. It's me. All right? Just take it easy. You want this? Here. Got your keys in there, too, so you can thank me for not letting tweakers take your phone and your car. Yeah, can I get those back? First, why do you have a fucking gun? Self-defense? Why do you have one? Because I'm supposed to have one. Wait, wait, wait. What are you doing? I'm calling the cops. - Look, I am the cops... - Don't fucking touch me. You don't need to call any more cops. I'm calling all the cops. - I don't trust you. - Look, I get it, okay? We haven't seen each other in years. We didn't end on a particularly awesome note. I get it. All right? It's just... - Are you okay? - Do I look okay? - Just calm down. - Calm fucking down? Do not start with me on that shit. Sorry. Sorry. Chopping up bodies out past the mill and... - That's crazy. What? - Some guy has my mom. And I got this gun actually... I can't understand when you're like this, okay? How much I care about you understanding... should be pretty clear based off the fact that I am calling different cops. Can you just give me the gun? Can you just call this in to one of your buddies, who's, like, a non-corrupt... whatever you call a non-corrupt cop. - A good cop. - A good cop. - I'm a good cop. - I've never believed anything less in my life. And even if I fucking did, you couldn't handle all this shit on your own, Travis. So can you please just call this in as a favor to me? For being the world's shittiest boyfriend or whatever? Okay. Fine. Whatever. - Where again? - Out on Echo Lake. It's past the mill by the gorge. There's a big farm. They are chopping up bodies, I don't know what for. Okay. Okay. It's all called in. They're on their way. Now can you please... just give me the gun? Why? Do I need to show you my permit or something? - No, it's just that... - What, Travis? We've learned shooting together. I did also go to basic training. I know... And you had to get kicked out for doing drugs. What, do you think I'm gonna cheat on you with a gun - or something? - Come on. Come on, what? Half the black eyes you gave me... were because you thought I was fucking the neighbor, - the mailman... - Ancient fucking history. Jesus. It's like yesterday for me, you know. I have to relive your bullshit... - every single day. - I wasn't that bad. Every time I see a girl in public who looked scared of her boyfriend... You don't need to do this. Every time I see a TV show about rape... Okay, I get it. Every time I wake up in the morning and my shoulder hurts from when you threw me down the stairs. Okay, how many times... do I have to say I'm sorry for all that? You could start with one. Okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Okay, But... just give me the gun. All right? 'Cause when they get here... and they see you holding it, it's not gonna look good. Okay. You happy? All cops shoot white people for no reason. Believe it or not, I don't want them to kill you. Why would they? You told them I'm not a threat, right? Right? You're in on it. You're fucking in on it. You don't just know them. You're part of this. That's... that's crazy. What? What? No, No, I'm not crazy. - You can't say I'm crazy anymore. - You're wrong. You're wrong. - Back the fuck up. - Whoa, whoa. Okay. Do you see a vest? No. That's because I came here trusting you. We don't need to do this. What do we need to do, Travis? Get me all disarmed and safe for your body snatcher buddies. That's who you called, right? - You haven't changed a bit... - Just grow the fuck up. And by that, you mean, accept my fate is dictated by some dude who thinks he has authority over me? What then? What do I need to do... to get you to be reasonable? Nothing. Just give me my fucking keys. Your mom is dead from natural causes, okay? I had nothing to do with it. But you got here real fast... and I... Look, I didn't even think you would come. And, you know, it's gonna sound crass. Okay? But a dead body's a dead body and there are people that would pay really good money for the organs and everything. All the stuff. Okay. We have a good thing going. You're fucking kidding me. But only if we keep it quiet... Okay? If there's any exposure... they'll leave. Okay? They'll leave and they'll take all of their money, and everyone here loses... including you. What is it that you think I have to lose? How about your life? They will take your life... if you fuck with their thing. They can't have my mom. It's non-negotiable. They already have her. I'm trying to help you. - You always said that. - What? You always said you were trying to help me. You always said what? Even though you know what you heard me say. You always say "what," to throw me off. You always said "what," like that word was a weapon. You were never trying to help me, were you? Just calm down. Stop fucking saying that! They told me to try and get you to listen to reason. And if you wouldn't listen to reason, I'm not making you do anything. - This is your last chance. - I'll shoot you. I swear to God, I'll fucking shoot you. No, you won't. - You can't. - No, Travis, please. Please don't do this to me. Don't make me do this. Just put it down. Just... trust me. No, I don't trust you. You're a fucking snake. I always told you your temper is gonna get you killed. You're a cunt. I am sorry to have to break this news, but after tonight, we'll no longer need your services. I figured as much. We're not worried about security with you. You've been quiet about all this since you got here. And, well, you know that we know your background. Yeah. We'll furnish you with a more-than-fair severance for all your hard work and discretion. Plenty to keep you afloat for a bit while you figure out your next gig. Look, you all have treated me well, probably pay me more than you should. But I knew this wasn't a forever deal. Didn't have any aspirations of heading up the janitorial department and all. Of course. I don't want to be insulting here, but, uh, I have to remind you that ears will stay open around here, so just... I know, I get it. How long do you think you'll be until you're finished? A lot of mess here. I don't know. An hour or two, maybe. Let's make it one, please. There's only about 70 grand here. Go, go. Go away. Go. Hey, I had a couple of questions about the restroom. - Okay? - I haven't had to do that room yet, you know, like, do it. Well, we'll just have to consider burning this place down. Do whatever. I'm just telling you, with all this grout, the nooks and crannies probably can't get fully cleaned of DNA or whatever. Right? I just want my mom's body. Can I do that? Can I just get her and go? Do not make me shoot you. I don't want to shoot you. I don't want to do this. Whoa! Whoa! Okay. I'm really not in the fucking mood. Drop your weapons now. Dude, this is not the time to think of a fucking workaround. All your buddies are out of commission in there. Take your weapons, toss them. I said, I'm not in the mood. Okay. Dude! No, no, no, no! Hey. It's safe now. You should probably get out of here. This is Jenny, you know what to do. Jenny, listen. I'm sorry. Okay? I'm really sorry. I'm sorry I left you. I went away and I never came back and I just left you here like... I really thought it would have been worse to stay around. Well, where I went was way fucking worse. You know how I get about everything... obsessive about working out, dating the wrong people, drugs, alcohol, self-mutilation... Thought I gave each one of those things good, hard dedication for years. Honestly, I don't know how I'm still alive. I'm really sorry for telling you this in a stupid voice recording. I really, really wish I could see you just one more time, just once, but I can't... Because Mom's dead, Jenny. She's dead and I had to put her in a place so nobody would find her. I don't even know how to explain it. It's just awful. So don't try to find her because this is just really fucked up, okay? It's so fucked up. But I'm gonna go... I'm gonna go for good. I'm gonna leave and I'm not gonna come back. I'm so sorry, Jenny. I'm so sorry. We could have marched up here in tap shoes. Oh, you shouldn't have left the engine running on the truck with a GPS tracker stuck in it. Good news for you is that your mother's body is pretty much worthless to us now, so she'll stay intact. Without cold storage too long, not a high-dollar cadaver to begin with. Bad news... you and your little operation ruined a very lucrative business that's been running out of that property. Now I have to build back up from scratch. But I know that murdering you right now is the number one way to keep us from finding out where your crew is. The other guys? Yeah, the other guys with our petty cash. There are no other guys. Come on. What? You don't think a woman is capable of doing all this? Does the thought hurt your fragile little ego? Uncomfortable memories from when I beat your ass? Cut it out. Anything you can do, I can do bleeding. You may not care for your life, but what about the people you love? What about, uh, your sister? I haven't seen her in years. More bad news. We have people tracking her down right now tonight. - That's not necessary. - I think it is very necessary until we get you straightened out. Just let me bury my fucking mom, okay? What if a mountain lion digs her up? Or some kid out working on a wilderness merit badge, stumbles on the grave, then what? They aren't gonna find you. You don't need to bring my sister into this. You can either tell me what I want to know now or you can tell me what I want to know after I show you some cell phone pictures of what your sister looks like without an ear. I'm here all alone. There is no one else here. Jesus! Well, how do I verify that? How am I supposed to prove to you that something doesn't exist? I am the best person to negotiate with. Trust me. I guarantee you some of my co-workers... will not be nearly as diplomatic. You call all this shit diplomatic? You're a piece of shit! These two... These two are majorly pieces of shit. Frankly, everyone that I've met today is a total piece of shit! You know, they call me when they need help. I'm not here to hurt. I am here to help. So help me help you, help me understand why are you so angry? I'm angry? My life has been nothing but dudes flying off the handle at the slightest threat to their perceived masculinity. Some guy standing here threatening mutilation to me and my sister. And he wants to know why I'm so fucking angry. I asked. I remember when I was a little kid, my mom... she started setting me up on these stupid play dates with the boy across the street. He was an idiot. He'd, like, jump up and down and wave his hands over my face trying to get my attention. And all I wanted to do was play with my Legos. I remember the shadow from his hand on my face 'cause it would block out the sun. And my world got a little darker. The older I got, the more boys showed up... Waving their hands trying to get my attention, you know... Blocking out the sun. Then I got older, and the fingers on those hands started to curl, clench and restrain and hold me down... And my world got a lot darker. It got to the point where there was no light at all because all I could fucking see was fists blocking out the sun. And you... another man with your fists. You wanna know why I'm so fucking angry? You got me. I'll assume I rudely underestimated your prowess. You got me. Fierce kill. Could you do me a favor and toss me the med kit out of the back of that truck? I'd show you the wound. But you just murdered two of my guys, and I don't think you have a very high opinion of me right now. I promise not to pull a fast one. I'm just bleeding here. Drop that right fucking now. I'm gonna count to one and then I'm going to shoot you. Whatever else you got, lose it. I will fire at you, dude. I don't doubt it. How many more people get to shoot him tonight? I'm sure we can find some eager volunteers. There was a day when I was young and spry. And I wouldn't have mentioned this. I would have tried to find an opening to disarm and disable you. That day is not today. You're smarter than I thought. Also, don't care anymore. I'm a tired old man. Still a man... A man who tried to shoot me. - We're not all bad, you know. - You know, men keep telling me that today, usually right after they've threatened me with a firearm. You did get me, though. I just want to give my mom the peace that she deserves. The peace that you guys didn't want to let her have. - What about the theft? - The money? That money doesn't even cover the shit that you've put me through today. I don't have it and I don't even care about it. I mean, okay. So you're gonna tell me where my sister is or what? I have no idea where your sister is. That's not how things work. Yeah, I don't believe you. You know how Al-Qaeda works? Terrorist groups, splinter cells. It's a great system. You could stick hot needles in my eyes for days at a time, you'll never get a location 'cause I don't know it. I report to rooks. They report to the king. King calls the plays... I have no idea where any rooks are right now or where the king is. Fuck. If it's any consolation. I'd tell you if I knew. A true fucking gentleman. I know I'm not really in a position to make deals. But can you promise me a bullet right here? Honor among... warriors, whatever. I'm a dead man, either way. I'm not the only one that knows about the GPS tracker. Ah, blood loss doesn't do me. They'll make it slow and painful. You know, as an example to others. Boo-fucking-hoo. I am not looking for sympathy. Do we have a deal or what? Here I thought you were an honorable girl. Woman. I'm a woman. Right. One bullet to the head. But I'm not your murder mommy. Do it yourself, dude. Hey, you need some help? No. - Car trouble? - Nope. I'm good. Thank you. Hey, I've got some tools in my car. I can take a look for you. No, dude. I'm good. Are you sure? I know a thing or two. Dude, you need to back off. Wow. I was just trying to talk to you. I don't want to date you. I don't want to talk to you. I don't want to fuck you. I have a boyfriend. I have a husband. I have a girlfriend. I have a wife. I have an yeast infection. Whatever it is that I need to say to get you to go away right now is what's happening with me. I'm a nice guy, you know. Uh-huh. Bitch. He was a dream today. - He is a dream, right? - Mmm-hmm. Best thing in my life. - He had three BMs. - Good. Yeah, and I could have sworn he was laughing. Okay. Hey, do you know your schedule for next week yet? - I'll have to get back to you on that. - No worries. - Thank you. - Oh, thanks. All righty. - See ya. - Bye. We're closed. Sorry. Um... I'm looking for my sister. She works here. Her name is Jenny Nelson. - I don't know. - It's serious. She works at one of these stands doing whatever it is you guys do. Look, I don't know a Jenny. Okay, I don't know her. And doing whatever it is we do? I get this shit all the time from soccer moms and churchies and other hypocrites. This is a job, okay? You think me showing some side boob is less honorable than restocking shelves at the dollar store? Fuck off. Do I have to call the cops? I take getting called a whore when I'm open, but we're closed. Oh, that's Sapphire. I didn't know her real name. Well, do you know a phone number, address? Maybe where she might be? Her social media is Sapphire Barista. Okay, cool. Thank you. Hey, do you want a coffee? You look really tired. Is Sapphire here? Sapphire, is she here or what? Why? Who are you? Her sister. Girl, you look fucked up. She's in the back with Matty. Cool. Jenny. Is your phone even on? Who are you? - Alex? - We really gotta go. Come on. - What? - Who is this? Why are you here? You can't just show up out of nowhere. I'll explain in the car. You really have to go. Who the fuck are you? I'm not talking to you, asshole. Why are you so angry? Because I've been dealing with dickheads like you all day. Fuck? Jenny, come on. Let's go. Get the fuck out of here, bitch. You need to back the fuck up. Now. Easy. You know how to use that thing? Alex, what the fuck are you doing? It's a matter of life and death, Jenny. You can be mad, but be mad in the car. You're not getting out of here with any teeth in your head. You fucked up big time, girlie. Oh, put your dick away, dude. No one cares. - What are you doing? - Come on. Have fun with that. Got to keep the crackheads out. Do they have guns? What the fuck are you doing? You are such a... Do they have guns or not? I don't know. They're not a gang or anything. They're just some fucking guys. And this is Matty's dad's place. He's gonna tear it down. So, no? I mean, I never see any here. Okay, okay, okay. Why are you here? I haven't seen you in years. And you just show up waving a gun around. Jenny, it's complicated. It's complicated. Okay? It's Mom and she... Yo, bitch. Get out here. Mom? Hold on. Matty. This is my sister, okay? Clearly, she's had a rough day. Can we just get out of here? Something's going on with our mom. Fuck your mom. Fuck you and especially fuck your sister. Excuse me? Get that girl out here right fucking now. Or what? Come out and get your beating. Fucking scared. Got something else to put in my fucking face? You got ten seconds. - Ten... - What are you doing? - Nine... - No, no. Eight, seven... Six, five... four, three... two, one... We need to call 911, now. No, we don't. Why? What happened, Alex? What the fuck is all this? What happened? Where's Mom? What is that? Jenny, get in the car. Come on. What the fuck? Jenny, come on. What did you do? What did you do to her? I didn't do anything, Jenny. She died of a stroke last night. We cannot be here. We have to go. She wasn't even sick. I talked to her last week. Stop fighting. Why did you hate her? We can have this conversation in the car. Imagine your own daughter won't even talk to you for years. Jenny, please. You killed her. I was a bad daughter, Jenny. I was really bad to say. But Mom was a really good person. Her intentions were good. And I know that every single day women will take the word of a man over the word of a woman. Even if that woman is their daughter. I didn't know that then, but I know it now. It will eat at my soul for the rest of my life that I couldn't tell her that before she died. But it's gonna be the end of my life and the end of yours if we don't get out of here right now. I don't fucking care. Do you even understand what I'm feeling right now? Especially after what just happened. So what? You're just gonna sit here until they come and kill us? 'Cause all those guys in there with the guns. That's not the whole team. Fuck it. I'm not gonna let you die alone like Mom. Fine. Now what? I don't know. Now we should call the cops. A cop was the first person I had to... ...kill tonight. You killed a cop? He was drawing on me. Jenny, I didn't want to, even though I had every reason to, especially after what he did to you... Wait. Travis? He's dead? Hello. Miss Nelson. Who are you? I write the checks, and right now I'm writing checks to more men who will hopefully solve the problems you created for me today. There's always more men. You don't have a play here other than running, and I have a lot of eyes. I applaud your skill, though, or should I say luck? But the luck will run out. We can find you wherever you go. You and your little operation ruined a very lucrative business that has been running out of that property. Now we will have to relocate. Should I let it play on, Mr. Check Writer? Or do you get the point? You have what you wanted. Your mother, sister. And now you have collateral. I have a lot of bodies and two girls threatening my business. How about we sit down and talk before this gets worse? Why the hell would I want to sit down with you? Who else is there? Do the math. Okay, fine. But I want this to be a grown-up conversation without a bunch of children in grown-up costumes waving guns in my face. Can you do that? Are you the one man I meet today who can talk to me like I'm an actual human being? Scout's honor. Although I'd recommend against any new gadget, please. One call and we'll have a manhunt on for the killer of a county deputy... Woman hunt. Semantics and political correctness, is that what we're doing now? Just tell me when and where, dude. You have an address now. Condolences for your mother. See you tomorrow afternoon. I'm full. Don't. I have to. You have no idea what you're walking into. No. No, I don't. But he's the guy. Like 'the' guy Why don't we just fuck off? Go to Europe for something? With what money, Jenny? If we ghost, he can get to us if he wants to. Like, we're in a grace period right now, so if we leave, he's gonna have the cops come after us for, like, ten or 20 fucking murders. You realize this is my only option, right? Our. Our option. You didn't do anything. You had nothing to do with this. You're not meeting him alone. Yes, I am. If he decides to chop my head off, I want you to take the audio file and send it to everyone. Anderson Cooper, the newspaper, whatever. And I want you to camp out in the most public place you can and hope that the least shitty cop shows up. If he's gonna kill us, the least that we can do is make his life really difficult. Fuck. Fuck. Jenny? I know. No, you don't. Look, I'm not gonna pretend that Mom didn't hurt me and piss me off. 'Cause she did. Like, Mom and I both took Travis's side at one point or another. I didn't wanna sleep with him. - He got me drunk. - I know. I know. He fucking raped you. He raped me, too. And I'm so, so sorry that I brought him into our lives. Okay? I was stubborn, mostly because part of me thought that I deserved what he did to me. I cursed and prayed until the moment she died. Because life fucking sucks. Yeah. And pride sucks, too. I've been too proud to give anyone a second chance, especially myself. Alex... it's not your fault. I wish we had more time. We will. - We might... - Hey... I love you. I haven't heard that from you in... I don't even know how many years. It didn't even hurt to say it. You don't have to do this. Look, I'm sorry for everything, okay? - Five o'clock, that's the cut-off time. - Alex... Get in. Get out. He's in there. Over here. You're much less intimidating in person. That's exactly what a not intimidated guy would say. Go ahead and have a seat. Definitely not intimidated. Now, you've seen the sausage making of organ transplants laid bare. Organ transplants for, uh, rich people. You have this much disdain for companies that offer more exclusive versions of cars, or shoes? Are you really equating body parts to shoes? - I figured you could relate. - 'Cause all women just love them some shoes. All right, we'll skip the banter. What do you want? I want you to stop... all of it, pack it all up. And leave. I'm a... big fan of cost-benefit analysis. Seeing if something's worth the hassle, even if it's a failure. I figured this meeting wouldn't cost me much. Extra day, little moving around of pieces. Maybe I wouldn't have to totally reboot this thing. Save myself some money. Well, a lot of money if we're being frank. That's what I thought you're after, money, or... safe passage out of the country or something. Maintaining discretion, there's always... an amount or price. Wanting me to stop... Uh, maybe this was a waste of time. I, uh... ...don't see much benefit here. I'll be, uh... fine taking this hit. - I assure you... - I'm telling you that you have a choice. A choice to be better... - Figured I'd be the first person to tell you... - Choice? You don't give out the choices, missy, I do. Can you at least leave my sister alone? - She wasn't involved in this. - She's very involved. She's involved, not vetted, and somebody whose trustworthiness, well... - We just don't know about. - Don't you have enough money? What do you get out of this anyway? I don't think you're my financial advisor, so I'm not gonna take your advice on how much money I have or need, all right? I have worked too hard to just stop. Can we just get this over with? You're trying to paint me as a monster, in charge of an army of monsters doing monstrous things. You think the same of someone who collects aluminum cans to recycle? That stuff is junk. It'll just rot away in a landfill anyway. When people die and they don't donate their organs, hair, skin, retina, where does that stuff go? It goes into a human landfill. We are putting that stuff to good use. We are saving lives, giving people the ability to walk or to see, to live a few extra years, yeah! It's for people who can afford it, but that's the world, honey. You remind me of my daughter. So confident... in the idea she knows everything about things of which she knows nothing. And when things don't work out, she pouts and cries. This is why I don't hire women. Women are... They're too emotional. They make mistakes. I don't think I made mistakes today. Today, you got lucky. You really think I'm stupid enough to let something like that happen again? I don't know, maybe ask your daughter. You don't know anything about me, my daughter, or anything else. I raised my girl to be three times the girl you are. I teach her, I protect her, I make sure she doesn't... run around with the wrong guys. Wouldn't want her making her own boyfriend decisions, would you? You of all people should know that girls date the wrong guys all the time and what they're after. Oh, so, you're like the gatekeeper of her vagina? - Oh! Don't you dare talk about her... - Her pussy? Her pussy that you feel the ownership of. - Oh, you're pathetic! - No, you're pathetic! What kinda man treats his daughter like livestock? - That's not honorable. - Oh, you don't know shit about honor. You're a life-long loser. You're sitting there all self-satisfied, even though you're one second away from being body parts on my shelf and zeroes on my ledger. Would you sell your daughter's body parts if she got a little lippy? Sell her genitals if they were tainted by an unapproved man? Shut the fuck up! Stop acting like you know how I run my family! I'm so sick of people like you. You think you know things. You don't know shit! My family, this whole thing, I built it from the ground up. It starts and ends with me, you hear that, you pathetic whore? - Me! - Oh, look, now who's angry. Oh, you wanna know what makes me angry, hmm? Bitches like you who poke and prod! - You won't leave shit alone! - I know dads like you. I know the shit that you do to your daughters. You manipulate them. You groom them. You brainwash them to think you know better than they do. You make them second-guess their life choices, their self-worth - and then you touch them. - Oh, don't you dare imply I touch my daughter! Nothing like sex with random dudes get the taste of daddy issues out of your mouth. Say one more word... I fuckin' dare you! I will beat you till you shit out of your bones! Women are too emotional. Here we go. You can walk away... you can walk away right now! You can get another job, another life. You have that choice. But you need to make it right now! All right. It's okay... Are we free? Like you ever had to ask. Alex. Stay here. Good morning, Ms. Nelson. It's just me here today. May I open the trunk? Now, you can look at this as a token, as an incentive to keep quiet... - or as a signing bonus. - For what? Excusing the man we allowed to think was in charge. You shut down a chessboard. Not the chessboard. You kinda made mince meat out of a whole bunch of guys we thought were good at their jobs. So, I've been sent to offer you a position. - And we hardly ever offer positions to women. - No, thanks. Look, we know that you know things. And we also know you're gonna keep quiet, because all of those murders, they can't all be self-defense, right? These last few months, you've been allowed to exist. That wasn't even guaranteed. Management sees you as a non-issue right now. But turning down this offer may result in somebody way up the totem pole changing their mind, and a whole bunch of guys might come through here to clean up what's been reclassified as "too risky." Good. Bye. You forgot your cash. That's your cash. I don't want it. That cash doesn't even put a dent in our slush fund. Keep it. Buy yourself something nice. Maybe upgrade to a place that doesn't have four wheels, one of which is flat. We know where you are at all times. There's really no reason to rough it like this. Good luck! Do we have to go? Not if we don't want to. I'm reading one of the old books in here. It's about World War II. There was this dude... who was a total fuck-up. Got discharged and they told him to go kick rocks. But he signed back up and they let him in. I guess, 'cause they needed people real bad for the war. And he lied his way into becoming the official hangman for the US military. You know it's "hanged" and not "hung"? Anyways, this dude, he hanged, like, 100 people and was super proud of it. He bragged all over the place. He loved hanging people. Isn't that fucked up? Who makes out their career, like, who sits there as a kid and says, "I wanna be a murderer when I grow up." - What happened to him? - Huh? The war ended. The hangman? What did he do? He was setting up some lights on a military base... and electrocuted himself. Sometimes I wonder about who our dads were... or are. Maybe one of them is a sick bastard who wants to be a hangman. Or, like, is the guy who does the lethal injections at prisons. I mean, it's not likely, but... I still do wonder who they are sometimes, what their story is... you know? Who cares?
