Hungary, 16th Century Countess Elizabeth Bathory Nadasdy, ...this Royal High Tribunal, presided over by... ...His Honor Theodosius Serviensis Szyulo... ...and Governor Gyorgy Thurzo, ...finds you guilty of sorcery, ...vampirism, and devil worship. You are sentenced to be confined to your own chambers... ...and remain in said forever. Until death sets you free. Your servants Ilona Joo and Dorottya Szentes... ...shall be tortured... ...and burned. Your cousin, Mozes Otvos, shall be hanged. Your remaining Confederates, ...Darvula, Barsony, and Thorko, shall be beheaded. You bastards! I will return from the ashes, ...and I will turn your world into a hell of blood and death! She's a monster! She has consumed human blood. She's a cannibal. She has given herself over to the devil. Maidens, young men, and children... ...have been tortured and sacrificed to satisfy her... ...and her evil followers. Waldemar Daninsky, the Polish nobleman. Has served her faithfully. He bears the mark of the pentagram. She manipulated him with satanic powers... ...and used him for diabolical purposes. Waldemar Daninsky, ...this High Tribunal finds you guilty of numerous heinous crimes. On nights of the full moon, taking the form of a giant wolf, ...you have devoured hundreds of innocent victims. For all this, your face shall be covered with the mask of shame... ...and your dark heart pierced with the holy cross... ...made of wrought silver from the chalice of Mallenza. At last my spirit will be at peace. Let the sentence be carried out! May our most merciful God have pity on your souls. Erika's back from Munich next week. Soon, Transylvania, the Carpathians, and a world of mystery! It'll be an exciting adventure, just like jumping back in time. You guys are nuts! Why go there when all the fun is here in Rome? You'll be wasting your vacations! Your friends gone mad! No one believes in ghosts and all that. Remember what happened the other day? She had a few drinks and started babbling... ...about Black Masses, witchcraft, invoking the devil... ...and that Romanian countess. Or was it Polish? Hungarian, Renato, Hungarian. Whatever. It's all the same. She said she contacted her in a séance. It's all wild. She was drunk. We should out her some slack. Shut up, you idiots! We're scientists! We've spent many years engaged in serious research. Erika is free to think whatever she wants. Scientists? You're too beautiful for something so dull. Come on, cuties! Stop playing at intellectualism. When it comes to having a good time, you're no different from the rest of us! Always talking of anthropology, parapsychology, ...and all that other stuff. What's the matter? Tossed into the pool? Can you believe this woman? You know, Renato, they can go to hell! Fuck off! Stupid! This medallion once belonged to Countess Elizabeth Bathory. It is the most valuable piece in the collection. Professor, the legend says that if the blood of a maiden... ...is spilled over her ashes and invokes the Tarot... Yes, I know, I know. Elizabeth Bathory will come back to life. As you know, Karen, Barbara, and I have researched old libraries, ...ruined castles, ancient monasteries, ...manuscripts, documents... You were my best students. I'm proud of your dedication. You in particular. You are the soul of that work. We have found Bathory's tomb... ...and that of Theodosius, her loyal servant. And that of Waldemar Daninsky, the lycanthrope. You have found them? You're telling me now? You should have written to me! I wanted to tell you personally. So where are they? Somewhere in the Carpathian Mountains, ...buried at Castle Cséjthe... ...in the region of Makavega. We're going there. Let's go. Yoyo! Think of the money I'll give you! You know I am a generous man. Yes, but stealing from the dead... especially these... They're no different than the others. They've been buried hundreds of years. They are only bones and dust. But stealing from the dead! We're not stealing. I'm outraged! I am a benefactor. My wish is to rescue these objects... ...and donate them to the Budapest Museum... ...so they are not lost in these tombs. Tonight, my friend, we are providing a great service to culture. I have worked for many years to confirm this location. Culture, Budapest Museum... You say something, Yoyo? No, sir. Just saying a prayer my mother taught me. You villagers are still superstitious! Ah, the ignorance! My best wishes for success. I only regret I can't go with you. Professor, let me take the medallion. Erika, we are not Charlatans. We are scientists! For years I've had a proud association with the University of Munich. I won't let you betray that... ...with superstition and black magic! Listen, Mr. Verez. Did you see that light? A lost soul for sure! Again with the ghost stories. I didn't see anything. Nothing. Is that clear? At last! "Here lies Waldemar Daninsky." "The holy silver granted peace to his spirit." "Let no one disturb his rest," "...or great punishment shall befall they who mar his tomb." Mr. Verez, we still have time. Let's get out of here now! Nonsense, Yoyo, old friend! Let's get to work. We have to move the stone. I have taken up Satanism and black magic. I have made contact with Elizabeth's tormented spirit. She calls to me, imploring me. Erika, have you lost your mind? Karen and Barbara will go with me. Their blood will serve the supreme ritual of resurrection. We will enter a world without death or pain. A world... of infinite power. I will never give you the medallion! Poor dear, you're a cripple. Elche! Elche! Come quick! Don't bother, Professor. She can't hear you. Why not? She lies dead in the hallway floor. I wasted no time in killing her. Now it's just the two of us... and no one knows I'm here. Elizabeth... ...at last I shall answer your call. At last, I shall free you from the torture of centuries... ...milady. Do you see him? A silver cross piercing his heart! God help us! A piece of incalculable value. Don't do it! Don't touch it! It's a deal, then. Payment in dollars. Here's your money. Well, the car's all yours. You sure it won't leave us stranded? It's a 20-year-old Opel. I know all about it. I've taken good care of it. The body is old, but the engine runs good. Besides, you won't find another one like it. They're carrying money. You know what to do. And they're gorgeous. We'll have a little fun besides. We'll take the shortcut and reach the crossroads ahead of them. Ladies. I don't want to meddle in your affairs... - He's trying to ruin our vacation! - Be quiet. Barbara! If you want to visit the Carpathian Mountains, ...go somewhere else. But don't go to Makavega and the castle ruins. Horrible things happen there. At night, strange lights lure unsuspecting visitors to their doom. It's a hideout for monsters and vampires. Not long ago, two madmen dared enter... ...and were never heard from again. I can tell you stories that will make you cringe. It's the Devil's tramping grounds. The inside of the ruins buzzes as if they were standing over hell itself. Some perspective! The roads are treacherous. No one uses them anymore. You might not make it. And I'd advise you not to go through the Moraba area. You may find bandits, ...killers, and robbers. Listen to me. Don't go. Thanks for the advice, but don't worry, we'll be just fine. - Here's the oar keys. - Thank you. Goodbye. We'll spend the night in Kisiloba. We're in for a long trip. Good bye. Some trip this has been. We'll never get there. That man was right. These roads can only lead to hell. Cut the complaining! We knew this wasn't a trip to the Trevi Fountain. O Rome, how far you are! The dough first! Then, anything else of value, and maybe a little pleasure. Don't worry. We'll more than make up for the inconvenience. Come on, honey. Calm down, beautiful. If you're good, I won't hurt you. The dough! Easy! Easy! Stop fighting! Pig! I want to go back! I can't take it! I can't take it! This is terrible! Well, I think it's done for. Now what? How will we make it back? I'll figure something out. First we'll visit the castle. That's what we came for. Then I'll decide what to do next. Let's go! Let's go! Come on. This is the grave of Waldemar Daninsky... ...the werewolf! The graves of Elizabeth Bathory and Otvos can't be far. At the end of this gallery there's a crypt. Erika, what are we going to do? Find the other graves. Come along. The handle is made of silver. It could come in handy. At last, Elizabeth... At last I will free you from your prison of centuries. I'm sorry about your friends accident. Fortunately, she will be well soon. Such a fall! I don't understand how she didn't get killed. I'm sorry I startled her. I thought that... Well, your clothing and appearance... ...to tell the truth, it's unsettling. Bad luck, to be sure, ...but we appreciate your hospitality, Mr. Burko. I wish I could offer something better, but this castle is all I have. As for food, there's only the hunt. Even so, it's been a nice couple of days, we assure you. - Thank you. - We'll leave when shes feeling better. Are we very far from civilization? Walking back to Gradizca with her... Across Slaughter Canyon are two villages, ...Bahavasta and Makavega. The roads can be tricky and dangerous, but I will be your guide. Drink this tea. Mircalla prepares it with local herbs. It will calm your nerves and help you to sleep. - Mircalla, how is she? - She's sleeping quietly. Drink your tea. I wrote that book for the University of Munich. It's the main reason for our visit. Did you find anything? - Yes. - No! I mean, nothing of interest. Well... only rats and bats. I suggest you avoid the ruins. Some places are about to fall apart, and it could be dangerous. Don't worry. We'll be careful. Wolves! There's quite a few around here. Sandor. I don't like this place. Only crazy folks like us would dare to be here. Full moon tonight. Some joke! Look, Kinga, ...Yula must have the tobacco by midnight. This is the shortest route, and this isn't bad shelter. You heard what they told us at Bahavasta. You don't really believe that stuff. Werewolves, ghosts... If anyone does show up, my old friend here can handle them. Those are fairy stories for the kids. Have a drink. Hey, maybe we could have some fun, huh? What if we're late? Yula is waiting. Of course we'll get there. But another half hour won't matter much. Erika, where are we? In the castle that time forgot. It frightens me... suffocates me... terrifies me! And that man, with those ancient clothes... ...he's either lying or crazy. He's neither, Barbara. What do you mean? It's clear, he acts medieval because he is medieval. You can't be serious. He only lied about one thing. His name is not Janos Burko. His name is... If you say that name, I'll think you've lost your mind. Have you not noticed his shield? It bears a rampant wolf, a cross, and the moon. Don't you remember what that means? But... But it's not possible! His grave is where we found those two bodies. He killed the men who attacked us. He needs to keep us alive. None of this is real. It's all a bad dream. Stop the nonsense! Our host is Waldemar Daninsky, the werewolf. And the ill-fated man bearing the sign of the pentagon on his chest... ...will only be set free of his curse... ...if a woman loves him enough to give her life as a ransom for his, ...piercing his heart with sacred silver under the full moon. One of us could liberate him. It's a long shot... but we are his only hope. He will not hurt us. This is a silver handle. We could make bullets. If something happens. I'll be ready. A werewolf! But it can't be! Werewolves do not exist! They do not exist. Waldemar. Karen is the chosen one. She will love you, ...and with her sacrifice, your spirit will find everlasting peace. I have read it in the stars. Look out for Erika. Waldemar. Her soul is as dark as night. She's completely evil. I know she's wicked... ...but she is so beautiful. Elizabeth, the great day is near. Soon it will be the second full moon. We will have the astral convergence we need for the ritual. And you will return. Our power will be infinite! The whole world will bow to us! We will rule over life and death! Everything is being accomplished. Soon Waldemar will find everlasting peace. Mircalla was accused of sorcery and sentenced to bum at the stake. Her body was already on fire when a storm quenched the flames. She was banished forever from town. I found her not long after that. It's an incredible story in this day and age. Sometimes I think it's all a dream. And that I'll wake up any minute now. I'm worried about Erika and Barbara. They hardly talk to me. I rarely see them anymore. We were so close before. Now it's like I hardly know them. When you leave here, everything will be as it was before. Waldemar, I won't have the courage to leave you. You pitiful ones who are about to die. Pray for the soul of the wretched Waldemar... ...wanderer from another world. My God. I saw how the cross was pulled from his heart, ...ending the slumber of centuries. He awoke to a wretched existence. I knew then I had to help him. I've been with him ever since. We took refuge in this castle in the mountains... ...waiting... You love him. You do love him, don't you? He loves you and you alone. And you must set him free. Mircalla. I don't think I can. I'm afraid I won't have the courage. Your love will give you strength. Your destiny will not be swayed. What about Erika and Barbara? Where could they be? What could have happened to them? Maybe they're dead. Perhaps. And that would be best. But if he returns, use the cross. It will protect you. You cannot let them near you. Erika. I need Waldemar to serve me again. We need his destructive force, his hunger for death, ...his invulnerability. Until the night of the great rite. I will not attain my full power. Only then will our master Satan hear my call. And then the empire of shadows will dominate the earth. But until then. The werewolf must be under my command. What shall I do? You will find him and place your mark upon him. You now belong to the shadows. And you have the power. But first, bring me his loyal Mircalla. She will be useful also. Be careful and make no mistakes... ...because if you do. Waldemar will surely destroy you. Karen, Mircalla has disappeared. I've searched the house, and I can't find her. I fear the worst. Waldemar, look. A piece of silk. It's from Erika's nightgown. In Bahavasta, in Makavega, in Buckovina... ...throughout the entire region... ...all they talk about are the murders committed by the werewolf. People are terrified. Many die drained of blood, nary a drop in their bodies. There are vampires. The dead arise from their graves, and people become ill. The authorities don't have a clue what to do, and panic grows. There's only one solution... Garlic! Tons of garlic, till it comes spilling out of their arses! How stupid you are, Creatus! All you think about is food. I don't even know why I keep you around. Garlic? Garlic! That's not enough, damn it! What about these vampires? Has anyone seen them? They say they are women. Rumor has it one of them is Countess Elizabeth Bathory. Look, preacher, sometimes you go too far. You know nothing, you fool. Listen to what my grandfather used to say. A ten-minute sermon moves the heart. Fifteen minutes moves the soul. More than fifteen minutes only moves your ass! If I don't stop you, you'll keep on going. I'm doing my job. Hold on, hold on. You didn't think you were a real preacher. You're just a crummy thief like me. As soon as that sweet couple goes to bed and gets cozy. We'll wipe the house clean. Tomorrow we'll be far away with our pockets full. Poor souls. To come to this end! I know it's horrible, ...but only by driving a stake through their hearts... ...and cleaving their heads from their bodies... ...can we prevent them returning from the dead. Yes, I know, I know. I'm sure the Countess and those monsters will return. When night falls, go to your room. Keep the silver cross close at hand. Waldemar, let's track them back to their crypts... ...and do what we can to destroy them. Only with the full moon will I have enough power... ...to face that demon. From now on you will serve me. Your master will soon be my slave! That monster almost made it. I never thought she could overtake me. Waldemar, we can't waste any more time. We must go to the ruins. If we don't, many a wretched soul... ...will share the fate of Erika and Barbara. We shall go. They have gone elsewhere. But where? This place is full of crypts and old tombs. Let's get out of here. We have to find them. - What if they come back? - I don't think so. They left Otvos behind to scare us. But they will not return. They have to find themselves a new lair. Waldemar... Waldemar, there's still a chance they'll be back. Let's wait until sunrise, please. Very well. We will wait. Come on! Whoa. - This is the place, no doubt. - What a place! Come on. Let's bring down the last casket and get out of here. Some job this is! Stealing coffins from the old cemetery and then bringing them here. Yes, but we've made plenty of money. We can now be independent. We can set up our funeral parlor and quit working for that old miser. The woman who hired us touched me. And cold shivers went up my spine. Her hand was cold as marble... like she was... ...like she was dead! Yes, but she paid us with gold coins... ...the good old kind. Forget the rest and let's go. It's all been useless! We'll keep on searching. We'll find her refuge. Karen, time is running out. Soon the moon will be full. Elizabeth Bathory will reach her full power... ...and the forces of evil will be set free. And when that happens, you must be far away from here. I know what I must do... and I will do it. I'm tired... drowsy... ...but I cannot surrender. I must remain awake. You will be mine at the next full moon, ...and Waldemar will again be my slave. Karen, come nightfall you must stay in your room. You will stay close to the cross at all times. Regardless what happens or what you hear, you must not come out. I will keep watch at all times. Those monsters will return. I should never have let you stay. Never. This is the Moraba area. It's possible the Countess has taken refuge somewhere in here. There are many crypts and abandoned tombs. We'll explore it. We have very little time left. Very well. Waldemar. Master, help me. My Master, help me. Thuistem, help me also. Send 99 black cats. I order you to do it because you are the supreme master of all cats. I saw you were asleep. I didn't mean to wake you. Karen, you didn't leave your room? Don't worry, it was morning. I had a horrible nightmare. Time ran out. Tonight will be the full moon. I will become a bloodthirsty monster. Countess Bathory will attack. You will be alone, completely alone. Your only defense is the cross. Don't be afraid, Waldemar. No one will hurt me. I will bar your windows and your doors. I will place white pine crosses on all of them. I'll go now and get the things I need. I'll be back soon. While I'm gone, go back to your room and look yourself in. I'll do as you wish. In the afternoon, I'll go into the forest. I don't want to be here when it happens. That monster! How could I have missed it? Her lair is here in the castle! And Karen... Karen! You shall obey me. You were once my slave and shall be my slave again. Obey! Obey! Accursed one!
