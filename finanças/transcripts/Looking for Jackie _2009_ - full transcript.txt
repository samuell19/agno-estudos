Now! Get her! Look out! - Brother. - I'm here. Don't worry. Cut! Director, what did you think? It was good, yeah? We set up the next scene? - Sure. - Okay. All right, everyone. Everyone. - How was it? - Great, nice work! - Oh, good. - Take a break. Good work, everyone. - Oh, master. - What's this? - You take this. - No, I couldn't. Take it! Go on, go on, go on. - Thanks. - Bye, everyone. - Thank you all. - Thanks, Mr. Chan. Thank you, everyone. Thank you, Mr. Chan. - Good-bye, Mr. Chan. - Thank you very much, everyone. You're welcome, Mr. Chan. That wasn't bad. A few things could've been better. Okay. Here's the next scene. All right, we're shooting the next scene now. Where's that disciple? All right, we're shooting Jackie's disciple scene. Where's Jackie's disciple? I was in the middle of doing a form, when suddenly, this guy grabs me and he says, "You have exactly the kind of talent I have been after. Now you must become my disciple." We're about to shoot Jackie choosing a disciple. Where's the kid we picked yesterday? Who's the kid we picked to play the disciple? - Me. - Me. I want the kid we picked yesterday. Who's playing Mr. Chan's disciple? Hey, you don't have to push, you know. Wake up! Grandma, I was dreaming about Jackie Chan. Give me a minute, and I'll finish it. Ah, my dear boy. You're already awake. So now it's time to get up. Here. It's your last day of classes today, then come the report cards, and then you start high school, finally. How can you still be so out of it? I'm still tired. Soon you'll turn 16, and yet, you still sleep like a baby. Hurry up! You can do the rest yourself. Granny, porridge is so boring. Your other Gran says porridge is good for your health. Hey, Granny. Do I really have to go stay with her this year? You need a bit of discipline. Perhaps she can stop you failing Chinese. Beijing. It's too cold! Like it or not, you're going. Besides, she already bought your ticket. I don't care. I'm not going. You hear? I won't go! I won't! My name is Zhang Yi-Shan. I was born in Beijing. When I turned ten, I came to live with my dad's mum, out here in the beautiful island nation of Indonesia. Now I'm in my final year at an overseas Chinese junior high. Okay. Show them your new moves, teacher. All right. As your reward for training hard, I'll give you a demonstration. Yi Shan, out here. Me? Come on. Well, then. You learn fast. Yes. My ear, my ear! You have to go and see Mr. Jin. I hear, in History, you're not doing so well. So go on, see Mr. Jin. "There is a branch of stream in front of my house. "I follow the stream into the city to train every die. "Day after die. "And my single biggest wash is to saw Jackie Chan on my way in." See? He can't even get that one. "Saw", not "see." "Saw." What are you doing? You're making fun of me? You know who I am? No. A disciple of Jackie Chan. Now, you say sorry. - No. - Apologise. Fight! Hello, Mr. Jin. Get to class. The essay your classmates read out had a lot of errors in it. Zhang Yi, how do I put this to you? For this topic, you're only getting a C. The work you handed in is rubbish. As your teacher, I'm embarrassed. Your writing is coarse, full of errors, and it wanders. Do you say it wonders? I said, it wanders. The writing in your essay does not express any meaning at all. Zhang Yi, this isn't China, yet you must learn your own language. Well, it's just, I don't see why. Well, I just want to be like Jackie Chan, eternally admired. I just don't get it. So what if I fail a few language tests? I only got a few characters wrong. So what if Mr. Jin wants to hold me back, and all the kids don't let up on me? Just wait. One day, I'll meet Jackie Chan, learn some real kung fu, and come back and show them. Zhang Yi. Mr. Thirteen. - Mr. Thirteen, Mr. Thirteen. - Why are you calling me that? Because thirteen isn't enough to pass. You're failing. - Say that again. - Mr. Thirteen. Zhang Yi, you starting a fight? Get back here. Stop him! Everybody on him! Let's see you show off now. I wasn't showing off at all. Anyway, I heard that Jackie Chan got beat up a lot. And that makes this all right? Every day, Jackie Chan this, Jackie Chan that, and yet, you can't pass a single test in Chinese? Well, I've decided. I'll learn kung fu from Jackie Chan first, and then Chinese. It's all my fault. I'm just not smart. Your mother and father, they're so busy working with this or that, they're hardly ever home, so it's all up to me. And since you won't go to Beijing, what can we do? I guess your mom will have to refund the ticket again. What's this? Granny, Jackie Chan is shooting a movie in Beijing! I checked the internet for information on his lineage, and learned about his background with the Yuan-Jia crew. That's it. First I'll have to get into the Yuan-Jia crew, then I'll go to Beijing, and look for him there. Please open your bags for customs inspection. And remember, say no to counterfeiting and piracy. Also, comply with IPR laws. Please, enjoy your time in China. Thank you. Hey, you didn't say where you were going. Oh, right. I almost forgot. I want to go here. - I can't look at that. - Huh? All distractions are illegal. Just tell me. Uh, Qing... Qing Shi... Qing Shi Temple. No such place. Qingshi Monastry. That must be what you mean. Monastry? - That's right. - Okay. Then, let's go there. It's really far. In the country. That's okay. All right. If that's what you want. You know, dear, when Zhang isn't here, you miss him to death. But when he is, you teach him to death. He's still only a child. You shouldn't be so strict. Give the kid a break. Am I that bad? All I ask is that each day he run for an hour, paint for two, practice piano for three, and study for four. It keeps him out of trouble. - What's wrong with that? - What's wrong with that? He likes playing sport, yes, but he's no good with his head. How will he succeed like that? - Yeah. How? - I'll go and get the phone. Hello? - In laws. Hello. - Ah, Mrs. Shan. Is Yi-Shan there now? Pardon? Yi Shan's in Beijing? - Let me speak! - Is he here alone? Mrs. Shan, how are you? I'm good. Has Yi-Shan arrived yet? But I thought he wasn't coming to Beijing this year. But he isn't there? How can that be? If he was coming, he should've landed this morning, and be here by now. Hey. How come you're here? It's just, if you're here because you want to pray, I'm sorry, you'll have to come back tomorrow. If you're here to look around, 20 yuan. But I'm not here for either one. Why are you here? Hey, can I ask you something? Here. This picture's taken here, right? This is Tanzhe temple. This is Qingshi monastery. - There's a big difference. - Let me come and see. Go away. Let me just have a look. I just want a look. Listen, jerk, you're not allowed. There are rules, you know. And I think that you have no respect, nor any manners. You should ask me if you're allowed in. You can't come in. Let me in. I just want to go in. Okay. Now you really can't come in because you're useless. - Says who? - Hey! Master, he's trying to go in without asking. No, I'm not. She's lying. Now, you listen, kid. You're not here to pray or look around. Why are you here? Well, I'm here to see Jackie Chan. Listen, son. Lousy kung fu can be improved. However, a lousy person can't improve anything. And a boy your age needs to learn some manners. If Jackie Chan was here, he wouldn't take you in. Li Xia, come inside. Master says it's cold out here. You can stay inside. Master says to give you some bedding. Hey, how come you're making faces like that? It isn't becoming. And you're quite pretty, especially your eyes. Don't talk about my eyes. Why can't I say you have nice eyes? You're just not allowed. Okay? - Nice eyes, nice eyes. - Stop it. - You can't talk about my eyes. - Nice eyes, nice eyes. All right. Hey, but your teeth. - My teeth? - Have a roll. You rat! You little jerk. Hey, that tickles! Have some more. Go on. - Let go. - You let go. - You go first. - No, you first. I'm not letting go. Then I won't let go. Tired yet? You think I'm scared? You letting go or not? We'll both let go. Fine. One. Two. Three. Let go. Can I ask something? I suppose. Today, when I came here, you were coming back. You weren't watching the main gate. Were you goofing off? That's none of your concern. Well, let's say I go tell your master. Where does she stay? I'll go tell her that you weren't watching the gate. Abbot. Hey! I had a question about the scriptures I wanted to ask you about. Yes, I've explained it to him so now it's okay. Li Xia, you should be going to bed. So, what were you doing this afternoon? You want to know? Then come with me to the mountain in the morning. But I'll freeze to death. Weren't you looking for Jackie Chan? You know, if you come, you won't regret it. Is he going to be there? Come on, let's go. Hurry! Or we'll be too late. Go. Move it. Freeze! Stay where you are. Don't move. Hey, kid. What are you doing here? You're one of Jackie Chan's brothers. Yuan. Yuan somebody. I saw you on Jackie Chan's lineage. A photo was there. He's your brother. I really want to meet him. Do you know where he is? Where's the director? Why is this kid without makeup? Is he here to work, or chase stars? I can't work like this. You okay? Your master stays in the temple. I mean, she wouldn't come out. - Yeah, so? - So how about, while you stay here, I'll watch the front gate. Can you do that? Yeah, it's easy. In exchange, I want you to do something for me. I want you to help me ask Mr. Juan where I can find Jackie Chan. Straighten up. Eyes ahead. Head up. Okay. Okay. That's a wrap. Change costumes. Nice work, everyone. Get some lunch. - Change costumes. - Master Juan! Hey, hold up! Wait a second. Are you all right? Here, let me help you. Oh, thank you. What is it? Would you take a photo with me? - Sure, no problem. - Oh, thanks. By the way, you were very good today. Was I? You jerk, you're being lazy again. It's you who's lazy. You think I'm going to have visitors in this weather? Why are you dressed like that? Well, because it's freezing. Huh? Hey, well. So, what happened? I got his picture. That's great. Well, what did he say? Where's Jackie Chan? What did he say? I forgot. I was nervous. Huh? Would you stop crying? It's all right. Really, it is. I really let you down. All day, you kept a watch for me. And I forgot the one thing I had to do. Well, it's no big deal. I can just keep looking. I'll find him eventually, a smart guy like me. Well, that's how I stumbled into a Taoist monastery. It wasn't until I was about to leave that I found out Li Xia was an opera student. She was there for the winter to experience temple life herself. And the priest who seemed really tough at first turned out actually to be quite kind. She was also Li Xia's aunt. They were very nice to me, and asked me to stay. But I couldn't, as I had more important business at hand: To find Jackie Chan. - Hey. - Move along. Get your ticket. Come on. There you are. There's one at 5:30, right? - Yes. - One ticket. Thanks. Hey, I just want to get in here for a minute. I'll be fast. Thanks. - I want to go here. - Where's that? This temple, here. We have a lot of tourist spots. Which is it? This one. Here. Tanzhe temple. Do you want first class or coach? Can't go wrong this time. I'll take one... My wallet. Smokes, sunflower seeds, gum. - Hey! - Oh, you want some smokes, kid? No. No. Too young to smoke. Okay. How about some gum? One yuan. No, thank you. I'm fine. Only one yuan. Lost your wallet, huh? What did you say? There's an alleyway behind the station. One hour. Wait for me there. Smokes, sunflower seeds. Smokes, sunflower seeds, gum. Too many customers. So many, couldn't get away. You going to help me or not? Let's go. You know that I won't be able to get you the money in your wallet, but I can get your ID and bank card. Why are you helping? Because you're a handsome kid. Huh? Hey. Can you get my stuff back, or can't you? If not, I'm leaving. If you don't trust me, you can go. I don't mind. Judging by your looks, I doubt you can help me. I'm going. Sister Rong. Hey, give me back my wallet! You hungry? Eat something. Come on. What? You worried that I'm going to hurt you? Tell me your name. Shan. How old are you? Sixteen. You know that bad kid who took your wallet? What are you doing, coming in without knocking? Hong. You're back early. Oh, look at this. Doesn't he look like little Shan? Hey, why did you hit her? Let me go! Hong, don't, he's just a kid. Let him go. Give me that. Hey, what are you doing? What's this? Hey, little bastard, I hear you're one of Jackie Chan's disciples. Jackie Chan, the huge star. He's rich, this kid. Is that you, Yi-Shan? Who is it? Now, you listen. Listen good. I want two hundred thousand. What are you saying? If you call the police, he's a gonner. Ah, what do you mean? - I give up. - Enough. Okay, get up. You all right? I'm fine. Listen, a cop can't rely on just fancy footwork. You also have to use your head. Don't worry, captain, we'll keep practicing. Go ahead. Listen good. Take the two hundred thousand and put it inside the garbage can in front of the canteen at the train station, or the kid gets it. Listening to that, I'd say he's not a professional. I'd say he'll be easy to catch. We'll just go down and play it by ear. Get me some plain clothes. Okay. And take care of her. Thank you. Stop struggling. You won't be able to escape. I'm not. The chair leg's broken. Please, don't... Don't hate me. This is because of my brother. He's like you. About the same age. You're just so similar. When I saw you at the station, I was reminded of him. Then go find him. Last month, he and Hong were hitching a ride, and he fell onto the tracks. The truth is, I wanted you around. Just to have a meal, like he used to. Have you got a picture? That's Corky. He was your age. Everything I did was for him. Can you forgive me? I think it would be nice to have a sister like you. I don't have any brothers or sisters, so I'm always pushed around. Which is why I'm here in Beijing. I want to learn from Jackie Chan. And so then I'm going to beat all of them up. Did you stop to think that being able to beat up everyone doesn't mean anything? I've been waiting. Who the hell are you? Where do you think you're going? Run, brother Hong. Run! Brother Hong. How did you get hurt? Out of my way. Idiot! Get my things. Brother Hong, what happened? What do you think? The cops. Get your things, we have to go. Hurry. Where is he? You betrayed me. No, Hong. I did it for us. Let's turn ourselves in. Stop it. Stop hitting him. Stop it. Stop it. - Sister Rong. - It's okay. Watch where you're going. You watch where you're going. Go on, get out of here. I'm trying to work here. Whatever. I need to find a cop. What's that? I'm with the police. What do you need? You're a cop, huh? Well, I'm a hostage. What? You think I'm joking? Hey! Hang on a minute. Police. Don't move. And that's how Sister Rong was arrested. But I really felt bad for her, so I asked the police to be lenient on her, maybe even let her go. Hey, officer, could you let the lady go free? She didn't do anything wrong. She's had it hard. Please let her go. That's none of your concern. I'm sending you home shortly. But I can't go home just yet. I need Jackie Chan to teach me kung fu. Kung fu, huh? That's right. I'm in Beijing to find Jackie Chan so he can teach me kung fu. And after that, I'll set things right. You wait. I'll be right back to take you home. Hey, what are you doing? Hey! I told you to wait back there. - I'm not going home. - Why is that? Why? Because my grandmother's always bossing me around. You're a child. Someone has to look after you. I'm not going. Yes, you are. Move it! I'm not going back. I have to find Jackie Chan. Stop dreaming. Even if you find him, he's not going to care. So you say. I don't believe it. Hey! What's wrong with you? Here we are. Look, you can stay, but just for one night, at my place. And your grandparents can come and get you tomorrow. Come in. Bathroom's there. There's no lock, so make sure you knock first. You get the couch. This is just for tonight. Keep your hands off this, it's mine. Others in the kitchen. You should change, you stink. Everything off. What? But then I'll be naked. What's the problem? I've seen naked juvenile delinquents before. Here. I'm not wearing women's clothes. That's enough. They're my husband's, put them on. So, what's the trouble with you and your grandmother? She's so controlling. I have to run an hour every day, paint for two hours, practice piano for three, and the worst, study for four hours! International movie star Jackie Chan is collecting clothes and blankets for young disaster victims. Tomorrow, the star Jackie Chan will be holding a benefit, and all proceeds will be going towards purchasing blankets and bedding. And say you find him, you do know that it's all fake, none of it's real? Movie martial arts, none of it has any real use. Hey, you're wrong. All Jackie Chan's kung fu is real. I saw it on TV. And they said that most actors use doubles in their movies. They said that Jackie Chan doesn't. His is real. That's why he's got all those scars. Huh! And in real life, if he came across a real crook on the street, it'd all be useless. You don't know what you're talking about. Master Jackie Chan has taken out plenty of armed bad guys. And you? Have you ever caught any bad guys? If you're so great, why aren't you out there catching bad guys? I bet you can't catch anyone, you're all talk. Now, you just shut your mouth right this minute. I was catching criminals when you were still in diapers. Oh, yeah, you've caught lots of criminals. Don't you mean you've been pushing around kids like me? Beast woman. Say it again. Go on. Say that again. Beast woman. Hey. Huh? Escaped? Yes, I'll be right there. Hey. I just heard Hong got away. I have to go now. You stay here and look after yourself. I'll be right back. I want to find you here. Awesome. She's finally gone. Now I can finally get out of here and go and find Jackie. But my clothes are still soaking wet in the washing machine. Awesome. Where are we exactly? Oh, I know. - Young man. - Hey! Excuse me, how do we find this place here? Let me see. What's this place here? Well, that's what we're asking. It's this word. My daughter wrote it down, and I don't recognise it. - This word? - Yes. Just tell us what it says. Well, it might... I see. You're just a kid. Where did you get this? This uniform is someone else's. How old are you, then? Sixteen. I mean, I'm 18. Didn't they say that policemen these days must have graduated from college? That's right. Hey, kid, what's going on? Excuse me, may I be of assistance? - Ah, this is Jiahan street. - It's Jiahan street. You go straight up there and turn right. Then turn right. - Thank you. - Thank you. You, young man. Go home and study. Hey! I have a name, and it's not "Hey". Yeah, right. So when will Jackie be arriving? Uh, why? I wanna see him, so that I can be one of his disciples. Are you really a cop? Stay right there. I said, stay where you are. You okay? Hey, anybody! Help! Somebody, help! Anybody! Help! Jackie! Hurry up, quick! Be careful. Thank you. Miss. Slowly. - Straight to surgery. - Be careful. Hang in there. You've got to hang in there. Miss, please, take it easy. You have to save her. Please. I'm begging. - Calm down. - Please, save her. - We're trying. - Hang in there. Please. Please, don't die. How is she, doctor? This is our chief. - Ah, yes. - Hello, there. Doctor. Is she gonna be okay? This is the one who brought her in, isn't it? - Yes. - My, he looks so young. Enough babbling. Is she gonna be okay? You got her here just in time. It was touch and go, but she's now stabilised. Can she go home now? In time she can, but she received severe head trauma, and two broken ribs. So we need to keep her here for observation. - Well, I need to see her. - Hang on a minute. Wow, he's so worried. Tomorrow, okay? Right now, she needs to rest. Undisturbed. But come visit her tomorrow. Hey! Where are you going? I couldn't believe that after everything I went through, all the effort, that I let the one chance I had of seeing him slip by. But I don't regret any of it. The way I see it, I saved a different hero. That night, a police cruiser took me home. At night, Beijing is truly beautiful, but I hardly noticed. All I could think about was the lady officer lying in hospital. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Movie Show. I'm Jing-wei. In movie news today, China film group's new studio is now completed. A party has been thrown at the premises, attended by industry leaders: Jackie Chan, also John Woo, Chen Kai Ge. All are very excited. Yu Yang, Wang Xiao Tang, John Woo, Jackie Chan, Chen Kai Ge, and other celebrities conducted the opening ceremony. And what a ceremony it was, the opening of the new digital production studio. Grandad, what's that place? Where is it? Hello. How may I help you today? We're here to see Jackie Chan. He's here, isn't he? How is it you know he's here? We saw it on TV last night. Yes. Then I guess it's no longer a secret. He arrived yesterday, and all of a sudden, the whole world seems to know he's here. - So he really is here? - Hey. So we can meet him, right? Well, how do we get in? - Which way? - Where do we buy tickets? I'm sorry, but tourists aren't allowed in. But how about just my grandson? I think one boy wouldn't be any trouble. Except there's a great many grandsons who want to meet Jackie Chan. And if they all came in, what a mess that would cause. Hey, why don't you let me talk, okay? Okay, let me tell you something. Now, you like the movies right? Yes, well, I have an idea. Let's see. Beijing Studio. They choose extras out front. You need to mix in with those extras, then once you're in, they usually bring you over here. - Really? - Yeah. I used to be an extra. It's how I got here. And now I meet movie stars every day. - No way. - Yeah, of course I do. Look at this. Right here. - That's Jackie Chan. - Is it? Of course it is. I let him in yesterday, shook his hand. That one's John Woo there. He's a big shot. A big shot. Hey. And who are they over there? Ah, yes. Those girls over there are actresses in a movie. That's Yao Di on the left. She's very pretty. And the one on the right is Bai Bing. And her skin is very white. And the others, well, I couldn't quite see. They're shooting a movie called The Red Chamber. That's directed by Li Yao Hong. I know her. They've wrapped for the day, which means, they've finished. And they have to take the cast, all right, because this place is huge, yeah? So do they have, like, fight scenes with Jackie Chan? What are you talking about? In that story, there's no fighting. Your grandmother's right. You see, there's no fighting in The Red Chamber. Well, that's right. Now, if you studied, then you'd know that story. Really, it's like you know nothing at all. If you go to meet Jackie Chan one day, I don't think he'd be very impressed. You need to start studying. Can't you stop for one second? You're so irritating. I already said, I have a mouth of my own, I can ask, I have legs, I can walk. Would you just stop hounding me, already? - I just wanna... - Hey, stop that now. How dare you speak to your grandmother like that? Show some respect, young man. Hey. What did I just say? Truth is, I felt really bad about that. I knew that was no way to talk to my grandmother. I just couldn't help it. I had to follow my heart, and it was already at the place the security guard was talking about, at the studio where I would get my chance. My chance to finally meet my master. Jackie Chan. Filming for a new picture starts today. Extras, 60 yuan each. Signing up is over here. Okay, over here. We need extras for our film starting today, and we're offering 80 yuan. We're about to start shooting a scene with Jackie Chan. Where are the kids we chose yesterday? Okay, you and you. You and you. Come on. Let's go. Raise up the stand. Hurry up. Come on, come on. Okay, now where are the props? And you there, why aren't you finished yet? Come on. You extras over here, quickly. Wardrobe, are the disciples' clothes ready yet? We need them now. Get to it. Okay, we're about to start. Director, we're ready to go. Lift your head up higher. Disciples. Where are the disciples? I need them here. Now. Okay. Go. Break a leg. Okay. Right. Okay. Places. - Rolling. - One. Two. Three. - How was that? - Fine, fine. Next shot. She needs to run away, and then call Jackie. Then I want his leg in the wide. - That's it. - Got it. And then those kids. Hey, you guys. Keep acting dead, just like you are now. Huh? Act dead? How do I meet Jackie Chan if I'm dead? Quiet. Okay. Little Geng. Cut. That kid was moving around. Hey, what's wrong with you? You just ruined a really long take. What's wrong with you? Didn't you hear? You're dead, so just lay there. But I want to see Jackie Chan. Are you kidding me with this? We're trying to make a film here. - You better not do that again. - He wants to see Jackie Chan. What? You get another kid and we'll shoot the back of his head. Hey. When's Jackie Chan arriving? This is a film set, not a premiere. If you really want to see him, then you can. When the movie comes out. Okay. He's done. Pay him and get him out. - Let's go. - Huh? Oh, my. It's so big. Beijing studios. Ma'am? This is the VIP area. Extras aren't allowed. I am sorry, but I'm looking for the ladies' room. I can't find it. Could you not let me in? No, I can't do that. In here is just for the big stars. I'd get fired if I let you in. I'm just an old lady. How could a little old lady cause any trouble? I must quickly get back to filming. Surely it's no trouble. Oh. Hello, there. Are you okay? Oh, I was just looking. Never mind. Excuse me. Oh. Of course. Actually, young man. You wouldn't know where I could find Jackie Chan? And you're looking for him because? Well, it's nothing important. Really, it's just my grandson. You see, he wants to meet Mr. Chan. He came all the way from Indonesia just so he could meet Mr. Chan. And, well, what could I do? And you dressed up like this to go find him? Ridiculous, isn't it? He... It's just, he grew up away from us, and his parents are always too busy. And I try, but he thinks I'm too controlling. And I want to be able to communicate with him. But you see, we're generations apart, and he never wants to speak to me. And I... And I feel that I owe him something, I just... I want to help him with something. I want him to be happy. Then he might talk to me. And then I realised the answer. If he met his hero, maybe that would make him happy. I feel like a fool now. Why does he want to meet Jackie Chan? Well, I'm afraid I don't exactly know. Hey, lady. You said you wanted the toilet, now, come on. Wait. It's okay. You can use my rest room. It's right here. - But Mr. Chan... - Thank you, it's fine. You haven't finished the story about your grandson. Ah, yes. I'm begging you, please. I came all the way here to meet Jackie Chan, just one time. I'm always pushed around at my school. I really want to become one of his disciples. Just ask the director, I just want to see him once. I'm sorry, I can't. It's out of my hands. Here's your money, okay? Go home, okay? I'm sorry, I really am. Out of the way. Hey, you're still here. It's freezing. Aren't you cold? Yeah. I'm waiting for Jackie Chan. You think he'll see you? - Course he will. - Why? Well, why wouldn't he? I've got this poster. I'll just hold it up, like this. And if he sees, he'll come right over. All right, all right. There's always kids out here. My advice? Go home, all right? Hey, listen to me. Go away. He isn't going to see you, all right? You should be going home to study, it's late. Be good. Go home. Are you the kid looking for Mr. Chan? Uh-huh. Let's go, get in. Huh? - You okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. Ah, you're here. Master Chan. My name is Zhang Yi-Shan. I want to become your disciple. Many others want to as well. So why is it you want to be a disciple? Well, it's like this: I'm failing my classes at school. All my classes like History and Culture Studies. My classmates make fun of me and laugh. And one of them pushed me. I hit him, and they attacked me. I came to Beijing especially to meet you and become a disciple so I can learn kung fu, then I'll be able to go back and get revenge on all of them. You've been my idol ever since I was little. I wanted to meet you. Listen, you've got it all wrong. They're my disciples, I taught them kung fu, but not to fight or harm others. You said before that you were failing classes. Tell me, do you know where your hometown is? Respect the old, cherish the young. Your grandmother came to me. Did you know that? And how have you treated her? A person needs spirit and integrity. You are the future of China. You have to study hard, or your classmates will never respect you. I say to you, today, I won't take you as a disciple. But I promise that if you pass your classes and come and find me, I will see you. I know you'll do it. I believe in you. Why hasn't he come back yet? All right, have patience. It's been hours since they called. Why isn't he back yet? Ah, there he is. See? Grandma! Grandpa! Master Chan brought me back. Really? Wonderful. - Hello, again. - Master Chan. - Hello. - Hello, hello. Mission accomplished. Well, goodbye. - See you again. - Master Chan, Would you take a picture with me? Sure. Hey. With my camera. I'll send it once you pass your classes. That is Jackie Chan's lineage. Although, I'd like to know what... About the lineage of our family. What was your grandmother like? Ah. You should have known a long time ago. Yeah! Congratulations on reaching high school. See, now that I've become one of Jackie Chan's disciples, you're all too scared to mess with me. Zhang Yi-Shan, we never wanted to bully you. It's just, your Chinese scores were so low, and you refused to admit it, so we thought we'd teach you a lesson. And now that you've scored 80, we're happy to offer congratulations. Yeah. But I think you're all just scared I'll use my kung fu and beat you all up. No way. I'm not joking. I'll give Master Chan a call right now. - Oh, yeah. - Okay. There's no one there. I can't hear Jackie Chan. Be quiet. Master Chan? It's Zhang Yi-Shan. I scored 80 in my Chinese class. I still can't hear any Jackie Chan. Come on, let's go. He's so full of it.
