Based on the novel Olivia by Olivia Love has always been the key matter of my life... May the Gods grant me not to have profaned such a pure and cherished memory OLIVIA Olivia. That's an English name, of course. It doesn't mean much. - What is your name? - Victoire. There's a name! I couldn't be called Victoire. You need the stomach for it! In Miss Julie's office is a statue with wings called Victoire. - You know our headmistresses? - My mother does. She met them long ago. Oh, long ago... Years before. Before the tragedy. I also knew them in those days. All that I can say, is that they were quite different then. Settle down, Bayard! Come on! Hello, Victoire! It was all laughs, races, kind words and sweet gestures. They were as joyous as their pupils. Never a reproach. Not one! And when they cried, my dear, they shed tears of joy. Who would believe it now? Now is now. Hello, Ms. Dealey. How was your trip? - Fine, Miss. - My name is Frau Riesener. I will teach you German and the piano. Victoire had some errands to run. We asked her to pick you up on her way. - Did she recognize you easily? - She did. Wait for me! I hope the poor woman did not exhaust you with her nonsense! Oh no, Miss. Here she comes! When the class is over, Mimi is all smiles again. As for you, Georgie, you're always lost in a dream! Cécile, what is on your mind? This lace, Miss, what is it? - Chantilly. - Like the cream? Just as fluffy. Anna, you have the fire of Ireland in your eyes today. You'll break another plate later! Olivia! - You'll catch a cold! - No. There was frost in the forest earlier. Hello, Olivia. How you've grown, my child! Do you remember me? I'm Julie. No, you were a baby back then. And when we visited England, you were... Hardly 6 or 7. - I've forgotten. - You've forgotten your age? I'd brought you a book. Sophie's Misfortunes. I still have it. - I hope you'll like it here. - Oh, yes, Miss. - Are you so sure? - Yes, Miss. In a week she'll be on Miss Julie's side. I'll hold you to that. Georgie? What do you think? I'm Salomon. Mimi! Go show your new friend her room. Go on! Olivia will want to clean up after her journey. Good evening. Good evening, Miss. I'll prepare a fine assignment for tomorrow. Good evening, Miss. She leaves? For Paris. To see ministers and scholars. She's not a professor. Just wait until she hands you back your homework. Olivia, you will be staying opposite the ladies. I will see you at dinner. - Who is it? - The Italian teacher. - We call her Signorina. - She's a child. She's with Miss Julie. Here. The place is all yours. How lovely! My first room of my own! Anyone else, Pacha would be jealous. The pupils and teachers live above. - Lucky you. - Is that so, Pacha? He'll only answer when he knows you better. What are you doing here? In or out. Where are your manners? Mimi, why don't you let Ms. Dealey settle in? Olivia, Miss Cara will see you after dinner. It's a great honor she is doing for you. Give Miss Gertrude more cream. - She didn't eat her fish. - I'm fine. Quiet! I am here to educate your stomach. It is important. Perhaps more so than the rest. Victoire, please! This is my class, Signorina Baietto. You teach Italian, but let me remind you you know the difference between garlic-rubbed bread and actual cuisine. The new girl did justice to my meal. I'm pleased. Give Miss Dubois the rest. Her appetite is a sight to behold. - The arithmetic teacher. - Miss Dubois. The typical French name! Believe me, I cannot sleep on an empty stomach. - Good night, Miss Dubois. - Yes. Olivia and I are invited by Miss Cara. - Will she read the Bible? - Why! Whatever for? In England, we read it every night. This is a friendly invitation. Olivia will pour the coffee. I cannot even be a proper hostess. I used to like serving others. I can't anymore. - Do not hold it against me. - Oh, Miss Cara! You will host me. It will be lovely. Oh yes! Oh yes! That shawl slipped again... Thank you, Mimi. You have nurse's hands. Heavens! My migraine is back again! Oh, it's dreadful. Can I not spend one evening in peace? Shall we leave you? It's out of the question! I'm so happy to have you. Go on, spoil me, I'll forget all about it. But I'm afraid it won't be pleasant for you, my dears. Mimi... make me a hot cologne pad. It's on the mantelpiece. I wish I had your migraine instead of you. My dear child... I think it's getting better. If Olivia would give me some air, I would be fully cured. It is merely vapors now. Mimi, let's show the album to Olivia. And take the box of pralines on the table, as a reward for you both. Look, Olivia: life at our school, since its beginning. Here I am that first year, right after our holidays in Savoy. We had 10 pupils. Julie and I taught the classes. What a look! I would have liked to see you in that long dress! It's a crinoline. It suited me well. All the frills were lined with black velvet. - There's Signorina. - She's so skinny! She'd just arrived. She didn't eat every day, then. She was lucky to meet Julie. Do you recognize me, under my big Italian straw hat? I was already ill. And Frau Riesener beside you. She arrived a year after Signorina. And who is she? That's Laura. Laura Thompson. The minister's daughter? She was here last year. Will she come back? - I don't know. - Here she is again. You like her so much? I don't know. - I like her gaze. - I found her downright ugly. Without any grace or elegance. Intelligent, yes, of course. She took after her father. And Miss Julie? I haven't seen her. It's one of her whims. She hates photographs. She dislikes recollections of the past. That shawl slipped again. Good night, my darlings. You are both angels. I hope you were not too bored. It was a lovely evening! Wasn't it? I've never had so much fun at school before! - I am sure we will be friends. - Of course, Miss Cara. Go to bed. It's late. Julie hasn't come home. I am alone. I am always alone. Good night. - You, perhaps, will sleep. - Good night. - Miss Cara never liked Laura. - Why not? Laura, you see, was Miss Julie's favorite. - Good night. - Good night. - Is that you, Julie? - Yes, it's me. Here we are at home. Quiet! Why! You don't belong here. It's the older girls' study. - What is it? - The astrolabe. It shows the motions of the stars. The Princesse de Clèves. You can take it back to your room, you know. Really? Miss Julie says reading is healthy. She trusts us. We've never lost a book. Here comes Olga. A Russian. Her parents are nihilists. Her mother threw a bomb. They had to flee. Olivia, this is Olga. - And Cécile? - You won't see her often. - She studies in her room? - With her mirror. - And her dresses. - Shall we go outside? - To the forest? - Of course! How lovely! - One can just come in and out? - During recess. I'm used to walking in line. "In line"? How dreadful! - We are not soldiers. - Hey! Wait for us! How grand. Such fine weather! This morning, Miss Cara wanted to teach her class. - She couldn't. - Her migraine. She broke into tears. Poor thing. Her voice is so sweet. Maybe so. But don't you find Miss Julie so beautiful? I haven't looked at her much yet. She intimidates me. - She teases. - She's witty. Olivia, let me pick you a rose. Olivia, are you smart? I don't know. -And in school? - It depends. She's certainly smart. Olivia, Miss Julie's rose garden is right here. Flowers bloom until fall. In winter, roses are sent from Nice. Frau Riesener says the scent exhausts Miss Cara. Come on! Let's run in the forest! Pacha! Pacha! Victoire! - Well, Victoire. - What? What is for lunch today? Everyday the same question! Beef daube. - "Beef daube"? - Yes. That's swell. There's only one thing you care about: eating. Of course not, silly. But if you knew what I ate in those schools, you'd understand my stomach. It's ruined, poor thing. Ruined by their pittance. "Empty stomachs have no ears." But you have eyes! Yet you see nothing. Heavens, what am I to see? Girls learning 2 and 2 makes 4? Or the others, who have no interest in maths? And rightly so. And Frau Riesener? What about her? She teaches German. I don't know German. What kind of school is divided into two sides? Yes, I've heard them. Between the Julists and the Carists. What do you think? Me? Dreadful neologisms. No need to speak Latin to impress me. Miss Julie is patient, but still, it can't go on any longer. Miss Cara is nervous and ill. She has an excuse! - Her illness is Frau Riesener. - She's so devoted to her. "Devoted"? That's a good one. - What are you munching on? - Nothing. Some dough. To wait until lunch. I feel faint. Victoire, I think Miss Cara will be in condition to come down today. No need to bring her food up to her room. - Did you sleep well? - Did I sleep well? I didn't shut an eye. You came home late. Then I heard a door creaking all night. Signorina! - Yes, Miss? - Have all the hinges greased today. Check that the doors are closed. Yes, Miss. Certainly. Cara. No, Julie. I can't eat it. Just a little. It's excellent. Healthy people are dreadful. Here's what I need: boiled chicken and greens. - I hate it. - It's blancmange! - Help yourself. - Cara, have some. Leave me. I'm not hungry. Would you like to go for a walk then? - In the valley? - Yes. I'm afraid it is too cold for Miss Cara to go out. The air is damp with last night's rain. Olivia, you're not listening. Where are you? Signorina, what is Miss Cara's ailment? No one knows. - What do you think? - I don't think. - And the doctor? - Nothing. He suggested sleeping pills. Miss Julie says: "Doctors say it's nothing." But I see it torments her nonetheless. - I think... -Yes? She is well, when she wishes to be. She does it on purpose. And then... - There's Frau Riesener. - Why? She spurs her on. And I know why. Enough chitchat. It will be fast with you. You know your French and Latin grammar well. I'd forgotten! There's a reading tonight. Che piacere! Put on your evening dress, Olivia. Are you not sewing anything? Lazy girl! I came empty-handed so I could listen. I don't like to sew. How can one not like needlework? Here, look at mine. How deft you are, Signorina. And how vain... - Tonight... - Miss Baietto! Miss Cara needs you for her tea. She told me earlier she would not need it. She needs it now. Go, my child. It's so wonderful when she reads. I am certain you will like it. Tonight I shall read passages from Racine's Andromache. Before that, I have a few questions. Can one of you tell me who Andromache was? Let's see... I cannot believe you are all so ignorant. Andromache was Hector's wife. Good. What is Orestes' father's name? Agamemnon. Good. Who was Pyrrhus? Achilles' son. And Hermione? I don't know. I've never heard of her. You'll hear about her tonight. And I hope you will never forget. You answered well. Sit here, beside me. Hermione is the daughter of Helen and Menelaus. At the court of her fiancé Pyrrhus, she notices he starts to favor his captive Andromache. Then Orestes arrives. Are you so sure of your bet? She just doesn't know Miss Cara well enough yet. The king orders him to take Pyrrhus, Andromache's son, hostage. This passage starts with Andromache begging Hermione to talk to Pyrrhus and obtain the pardon of Astyanax. "Why do you flee, Madame? "Is it not a fair sight to your eyes "to see Hector's wife weeping at your feet? "I do not come with jealous tears "To claim a heart charmed by your art "By cruel hands, alas! I saw pierced "The only one whom my eyes sought "My flame long ago by Hector was lit "In his grave it is now buried "Yet my son remains "You will one day learn, Madame "How far our love for a son goes "But you will not learn, or so I hope "The mortal trouble it throws us into "When of all the goods surrounding us "He is the sole that remains "And yet his life is in peril "Alas! When tired of ten years of misery "The Trojans threatened your mother "I begged my Hector to show her mercy "You can beg Pyrrhus as I begged him "Why fear the child who outlived him? "Let me hide him on a secret island "Be assured that in his mother's care "My son will learn only to weep" Hermione. "I know your sorrows, but my duty "My father, impose silence upon me" - Good night, Miss. - Good night, dears. Olivia! Would you stay? I'd like to speak with you. Did you see that? She was walking as if in a dream. I've won my bet. I always knew she'd be a Julist. I won! I won! So what? "So what"? Be quiet. You always forget Miss Cara has an uneasy sleep. Do you want some lemonade? Do not drink so fast. You seem upset, my child. It's... It's Andromache. Well, well! Would you betray Shakespeare for our Racine? How unexpected. It's also because it was you. I do love Racine. I think... that I understood everything. Probably not on a first read. But that is fine, Olivia. One can be, must be charmed by the verses before grasping the characters. Enough about Racine. Tell me about you. Me? That's hardly interesting. Your mother told me you were unhappy with Miss Tock. It's true. I was unhappy. Yet it is a protestant school, like ours. Oh no, Miss. I felt like a freak, a black sheep, an outcast. - Are you not exaggerating? - It was even worse. Why? Tell me, Olivia. They only spoke of temptations, traps, abysses opening before us. A lie, even a careless one, meant moral and spiritual death. No good deeds, good sentiments or sacrifices could save us, save the Grace of the Eternal. I could hardly count on it, coming from a family of free spirits. When I compare my lovely room here to the dormitory, I now understand all that I missed before. It was no place to learn and to live. I see. It's so different here. Yes. Everything will be fine. Our Lord is much less demanding than Miss Tock's. - Go to bed, now. - Good night, Miss. Good night, Olivia. Good night, Olivia. I had a dream last night. A dreadful dream. We were in Africa. In Black Africa, with cannibals, in a religious school lead by a missionary. He had a family likeness with Frau Riesener. - And we were starving. - And you ate the missionary. Victoire, listen! I was raised religiously. Well, how is the new English girl doing? Olivia? She's very focused. She works with passion and enthusiasm! - Especially in literature! - Sure. Miss Julie did all she could to charm her. I understand her. Let me tell you, mathematics isn't worth a dime. Weekly essay Is Chimène a perverted girl, as the Academy claimed, in her feelings for the Cid? Something's on your nose. We don't have geography! - Look at this blue area. - It's the sea. With fabulous plants, fish like flowers and naked plungers. - "Naked"? - Be quiet! Listen. She's handing back our work today. Now come and see! How many pages did you write? - 6. - That's short! I wrote 8. Laura always wrote 14 or 15 pages! You're very gifted, Mimi. Singing, dancing, sewing dresses. Bravo, Mimi. She's less bright when it comes to cube roots. Excuse me. It's true, cube roots are useless in life. It's poetry. And my gift for impressions. In 71, my children, during the siege, we ate rat, rat fricassee. But with onions. You had to be hungry! I had a good stomach then! Mimi! Miss Dubois is a fine woman. And you are a monkey. The antics and laughs of a monkey are devoid of any kindness. Come, girls. I'm handing back your essays. Georgie, you're off topic. You were supposed to analyze Chimène's feelings, not Rodrigue's. He isn't the main subject. Mimi? You were not inspired. Antics don't make for good literature. Gertrude? You did all the adequate research. It's very good. You are a respectful girl. And you, Olga, very disrespectful. Chimène is nothing like the Anna Karenina you speak of. Cécile. Cécile! You focused on Chimène's dress and forgot her personality! Nina, you understood her feelings. Ah, Olivia! There's something there. But it's too weak. You'll have to expand. I'll take you to Paris, one day. She was harsh, today. Oh yes. And with you too. Victoire! Make an apricot souffle. The new girls have never tasted it! It's long to make! I'll send the little ones to whip the egg-whites. Come in. Oh, it's you? What is it? I've come to check on you, Miss. You've been well brought-up. Do you need anything? I see you so seldom, I'm not used to these kind gestures. It's all right. I am merely an ill woman, aren't I? Come near me. You don't like me, my child. What is it? Was I not kind? Oh, yes, Miss. You were very kind. I'm very grateful. Go away! Go back from whence you came! Go away! Go away, now! Well, my little English girls, did you like the schnitzels? - Oh yes, Miss. - You don't look so sure. - They like boiled beef. - What do they know? - And you, Olivia? - It was delicious. Well, well! Do we finally have a gourmet among us? Approving is not enough. One must judge. Do you not have some critique to provide? Anything to suggest? - I think... - How about that! Press on her nose and milk comes out! Hush, Victoire! Go on, Olivia. There was perhaps too much lemon. Congratulations, you refined palate! You deserve to be encouraged! You shall sit here. - Adèle! - I don't agree. What? The lemon enhances the flavor. You don't know anything. The girl was right. - I'm sorry, Miss. - She did it on purpose. It was an accident. The doctor said: "No sudden emotions"! I'm sorry. You're not sorry at all. You laugh. You and Miss Baietto hired her. No one ever listens to me. - They all want to upset me. - Come, Cara. No one cares. They'd let me starve to death. I cannot eat this meat. You'll make me ill. - Look. Here's your chicken. - It's too late. I couldn't eat a bite, now. Oh, Cara, please! I'll take you to Paris after your Italian lesson. Always remember the poor city of Strasbourg, symbol of death and defeat in a city brimming with life. It is not much next to the Tames. But look well as it flaunts its beauty. Have a look, Olivia. Nothing is solid in The Embarkation for Cythera. Watteau was ill. Just a play of lights and colors. But look! Little pagan that you are. Could you recognize the presence of the divine? You saw the lady I saluted, with the plumes? I will tell you about her. Here, have a seat. Two chocolates with frangipane cakes. Yes, Miss. In one week, she saw her husband and three children die of diphtheria. Oh, poor thing! A few months later, she married her husband's best friend. - Unbelievable! - Do not stare! Yes. There is always comfort in live, Olivia. - Miss Julie! - Oh, my dear Béatrice. - How are you? - Well, very well. Yes, I see. - No, that's not it. - What else? Oh, I don't know. Life is just... It's marvelous, Béatrice. Life is marvelous. That is the phrase that befits your age. Don't keep him waiting. Go on. - Goodbye, Miss Julie. - Goodbye. Who is she? A former pupil. She wouldn't eat anything. She was letting herself die, to her parents' despair. I cured her. I would spend hours with her. I held her hand and listened to her talk. It took a lot of patience. - My patience was rewarded. - I wish I were ill. Dear, foolish, girl. Not now. Your essay was better. I am glad. You're not gifted for long developments. But why should you be? Your mind is sharp like a bird's beak. Hurry, we'll miss the train. Come sit here. Victoire! Victoire! Where is she? - Victoire isn't here? - No, I'm not here. - Victoire... - What is it? Toast?? No... Yes, surely. But that's not it. Laura has arrived. Yes. She stopped by. The only one who ever made me believe in mathematics. Don't we have enough trouble as it is? With Laura? Such a bright and generous girl? It's not her. It's not the rod's fault it attracts lightning. Victoire, you are a good cook, but sometimes, I don't follow. As long as the prodigal child is here. Miss Julie asks that you make croque-monsieurs for lunch. Laura loves them. And what is this? Thank you. And what does Miss Cara say? I don't know. I haven't seen her. Laura will be delighted. She's insane. Olivia! Olivia! Oh! She's here. Why didn't you answer? One shouldn't enter without being invited to. We'd never have found you! Hurry downstairs, Miss Julie wants you. Come in. Come in, Olivia. Come in. Here is Laura. You've heard of her. She wants to meet you. Hello, Olivia. Hello, Laura. - Do you like it here? - Oh, yes. - How was your trip? - Excellent. And how was the sea? I see you already have fascinating things to talk about. I'll leave you a moment. You'll see, Olivia. No one can manage to hate Laura. No one. Why did she say that? I don't know. You're as intimidated as I. I think so. Every letter I received mentioned you. You're all anyone talks about. - Isn't it annoying? - It's intriguing! You're not disappointed? I don't think so. Let's go out. The forest was beautiful, in the days. "O lake! Silent rocks! "Caves! Dark forest! "You whom time spares or can forever restore "Keep of this night "Keep, fair nature, "The unfading memory!" Signorina! Cécile. I dislike your new hairdo. - I'm sorry. - You are shocked, perhaps? The English call it "a personal remark." Making an allusion to the person they speak with is to them an indiscretion or worse, an offense. We pretend not to hear. And yet, Cécile, these are the salt of conversation. Is it not better to speak of your hairdo than of Pascal's Pensées? - Certainly. Then let me tell you what I think. Your beauty justifies the care you put into it. Neglecting all the rest. But still, you must do it with intelligence. As a future duchess... For you have the intention of marrying an English duke. Naturally. Then remember that your beauty spares you the trouble of looking pretty. Does anyone else want to marry a duke? You? Yes, me! I'd love to. Well, well! I'm not surprised. Alas, I fear this wish will not come true. Do you have another, to replace it? That is the other. My 1st wish is to be loved by a great man, a poet, an artist. But it's not for me either... I'm not so sure. - Good night, girls. - Good night, Miss. The only thing I want, is that he be very unhappy when I meet him. - Good night. - Good night. Laura, I'll give you back the Shelley poems you lent me. Come in. I don't know where I put them. Laura, do you love her? Who? Shelley? No, Miss Julie. Strange question! I owe her everything. My father is so busy. She showed me what is most beautiful in life. Yes, but tell me, Laura. Does your heart beat when you see her? Does it stop when your hands touch? Does your throat close up when you speak to her? Really, Olivia, I feel none of that at all. Then what? There's nothing else. I love her is all. Good night. No one here likes me. I am alone, ill and desperate. A subject of mockery. Come, Cara. I love you. I want to see you well and happy again. How can I be, when everyone here turns from me? How can you say that? It's your fault, do you hear? You're unfair. I do everything I can to take your troubles away. Yes, you're perfect, I know. I don't need your perfection. And you know it! I want to die. I wish I were dead. Cara, I would give up my life for yours. Your life, maybe, but not your dear friends. Those you love and who love you. You steal all my affection. They start to love me, and then they draw away. What a wild imagination. I was counting on Olivia. But she loves you. You! Always you! Laura is back and it's the same. Laura! Olivia! Must you have them all? It's killing me! It's killing me! And it's your fault. My poor Laura. In this house, it is easier to have an appetite than a head or a heart. Now come. Come, my darling. I want to sleep. A dreamless sleep. You will sleep. I'll get your chloral from the cabinet. Why is everyone so mean to me? Do not torture yourself, my dear. Enough, now. I am a little girl. A very little girl. You'll spoil your eyes. What are you reading so late? - The Lake. - To learn it by heart? I wanted to hear the sound of your voice. "Stay thy flight, O time! "And happy hours "Tread by slowly "Let us savor the swift pleasures "Of our fairest days" There. Now get some rest. Shut your eyes. Come now, Olivia! You're too passionate, my dear. Good night. Miss Cara is sound asleep. She doesn't need her chloral. Don't worry about her, Miss Julie. Plus, you're here. - Right? - Thank you. What a shame you cannot celebrate Christmas with us! It will be sad without you. Your father is so selfish! No. I may as well tell you two: my father didn't call me. Then why are you leaving? It is better that I leave. Miss Cara is unwell. My presence upsets her. It'd be better for Miss Julie, I believe. Laura! I baked some brioche. I forgot to give it to you. Thank you, Victoire. Good bye, my dear. Safe trip. Laura, when will I see you again? When school ends, we will see each other often! Do you not see we're friends for life? Well! - What are you doing? - Nothing. Watching her go. My little Laura... Then come. I have one or two brioches left. No thank you. I'm not hungry. How about that! The world is upside down! Signorina! Signorina! At first, Miss Cara was convinced that Miss Julie cared about Laura only because of her intelligence. But this time it was different. - Laura was right to leave. - Yes. But it won't be of much help, because now, there's you. Come tell us the story of Paolo and Francesca da Rimini. Come in! Olivia? - May I? - Come in, my darling. I was thinking about Laura. I was feeling alone without her. I'm glad you've come. But I have a lot to do. Take a book and sit down. I love you. I love you. I love you. Oh, it's heavy! O Christmas Tree O Christmas Tree How lovely are your branches So many revelations tonight! Here is what sweet Gertrude dreams to be: a Marie Stuart! You see how easy it is to be happy. - For children, yes. - For us too. Do you think so? Olivia, how lovely you look! Who are you? A Parsi woman. Mother brought the costume back from India. Cécile, you are superb. The waltz! Come, Cara. Let us open the ball. Well, what are you waiting for? Do you not like this waltz? You look superb in that dress! Did you design it? Yes. I thought about it a lot. Do you not feel well? Have her sit down. Our beautiful Cécile... America is the queen of the ball. Lafayette got it right. Turn around, let us see you. Well, Olivia! Are you jealous of her beauty? You will never be beautiful per Se, and yet... Lovely eyes, a lovely mouth, a lovely body. Grace, Olivia, is sometimes preferable. But if I wanted to kiss you, how would I go past all these veils? Let me tell you a secret. I will come tonight. I will bring you candy. What is it, Olivia? What's wrong? Do you know what it's like to be in love? - Yes, I know. - Tell me about it. - How is it? - No. It's too terrible to tell, and too delightful to contemplate. Come now. Let us dance. - Why are you not dancing, Mimi? - To stay with you. But if you'd like... You're so light. Frau Riesener would scold me. My condition won't allow it. - Victoire! - Yes. Oh, dearest Victoire... Congratulations. Your Yule log was superb. - There's not a crumb left. - Naturally, it was so good. -Are you not coming up? - As a cook? No thank you. - Is everything OK? - Fine. Miss Cara seems calm. Thank you, Victoire. -And Frau Riesener? - Her? She went to bed. Listen, it's the final galopade! Everything will be fine, Victoire. It's Christmas Eve! Born is the divine child... Naturally. But the child was still nailed to a cross. I waltzed all night long! 11 p.m.! It's over, children. Off to bed! Olivia! Olivia! - What time is it? - 2 p.m. I was not to wake you and to bring you lunch. But hurry up. Miss Julie is waiting to hand you back your essay. Here. You won't be surprised to know it's not good. You haven't worked a lot lately, Olivia. You have been granted many gifts and true grace. It would be a shame to waste it in illusions. Yes. Do you hear? Illusions. I hurt you last night, and I'm sorry. If you cannot understand it, I cannot explain it to you. But there's one thing you must know: I try my best to do what's right. Right for you and for me. I like you, my dear. More than you think. Shall I serve tea here? Of course. As usual. Miss Julie is in her office. It may be more pleasant. Do you think so? What are you doing? You were asleep! Why do you come here to sleep? Answer me! But I assure you, Miss... Then you too. You, in whom I put so much hope! You betray me and abandon me too! What would your mother say if she saw you with unkempt hair, a wrinkled dress and fiery eyes? She turns you all into this: vicious girls! Have you no shame, Olivia? Well? What is it, Cara? "What is it"? But don't you see? One of your pets, your darling victims. Leave her! - Go away, Olivia. - Why? She's yours, isn't she? I know everything. You go to them at night in their rooms: Cécile, Baietto and now this one! - Enough, Cara. - Yes. Yes, I know. I know. What you don't know, you fool, is that I'm leaving. Miss Julie is leaving. Miss Julie is leaving. Finally! Victor Hugo wrote this in the 2nd part of his life. You will learn that, except in arithmetic, the second half is not like the first. He had ruined many things, as we do. He'd gone into voluntary exile. He thought he was old. Nothing could be done. "How memory is akin to remorse! "How everything leads back to tears! "How cold, Death, I feel thy touch "Dark bolt of humanity's door!" Girls, please. I must... Well, it's better that you hear it from me. I'm leaving the school. - Oh, Miss! -Yes. I received an offer from abroad that I cannot turn down. Miss Cara and I have decided to part. But nothing will change here. It's just an absence. An absence, and you are so young. But I, Miss... I'll never forget you. Never. "Never." Of course. "Never," such a small word... So short. You will see. Signorina, calm down. - She'll take you. - She's not gone. - Calm down. - That's not it. - Then what is it? - I don't know. She's right. I too feel very cold, all of a sudden. They've come to sign the separation agreement. Worse than a divorce. Come on! Back to work. It's not a pretty sight. Miss Julie is agreeing to everything. She was the one with the capital to start with. She won't get any of it back. Trust Frau Riesener on it. She's pushing Miss Cara. She knows what she wants. Let me tell you, Miss Dubois: when she'll be in charge here, I'll go work somewhere else. - Naturally, you have a job. - And you? Mathematics isn't a job. You can't eat numbers. "I wished to hear it from you. "Now nothing more. Goodbye, forever. "Forever! "Sir! Do you feel within yourself "how cruel a word for a lover to say?" Come sit here, Olivia. "In a month "In a year How shall we suffer, my Lord "That the seas keep us apart? "The day would begin and it would cease "Without Titus ever seeing Berenice? "Without that I should see Titus?" You're going out, Miss? It's not that I want to. But there are obligations I cannot escape. When one leaves forever, one must bid farewell to old friends. I won't be back late. Her migraine hasn't improved in 3 days. - I don't care. - Oh! You're heartless. What are hearts for? Why be so mean, Olivia? It'll only spoil your appetite. It'll make you bitter. Baietto! Baietto! I'm exhausted. I looked after Miss Cara the whole night. I need you to give her her tranquilizers tonight. No. I'll do it, if you like... Come. I'll show you the dose and then get some rest. Give it to her after dinner, around 9 p.m., and then leave her. Fine. I don't have the strength. God, I am so weary. I'm so tired. Everything's been ruined. My purest affections, my most secret thoughts. Now, I must bid farewell to all that I love. Even you, Olivia. Even you. - No! No! - Let me go. - No... - Let me go... Please. Quick! Get Signorina, Frau Riesener. Quick, run! Something has happened to Cara. It was after midnight. How do you know? When I heard her car, Sir, I checked the time. How did you know it was her car? Right after, Miss Julie came in. Really? What for? I had been ill. She came to see if I needed anything. - She didn't say anything? - No. Just "How are you?" She left you, and then called you. How much time had passed? About 2 minutes. No. She was very calm that morning. She had complained of her migraine but felt better that evening. So much so that I told her not to take her medicine. She told me I was right and that she'd set it by her bed in case she had trouble falling asleep. I was exhausted and gave instructions to Miss Dubois, then went to bed. Calm? No, Sir. She was agitated, nervous. She didn't say anything? No. She complained about her migraine. Is that all? Go on, speak. No. She said something else: "I regret doing it." - "Doing" what? - I haven't the faintest idea. How much sleeping pills did you give her? The dose Frau Riesener prescribed. - You'd swear on it? - Oh yes, I swear. I swear I gave her the dose prescribed by the doctor. A dose she took a 100 times. It couldn't hurt her. Do you recognize the bottle? - Yes. - Yes. - Where was it kept? - In a locked cabinet. I'd given Miss Dubois the key. - What did you do with it? - I left it on the cabinet. - There are 3 doses left. - There ought to be 4. I always write it down. When I showed it to Miss Dubois, there were 5. Frau Riesener, there were 4. - I am certain. - 5! What do you have to say? It's not true. I don't know, maybe. Maybe there were 5. I'm bad with numbers. But I swear I gave the exact dose Frau Riesener had indicated. The result: she's dead. Your pledges won't change a thing. Death by accident. Caused by the absorption of an overdose of chloral. Is that all? That's it? What else? Everyone respects these ladies. "Woe to he by whom the offense comes." It is better this way. Maybe Miss Cara went to the cabinet. So Miss Julie says. I believe the opposite. Had she wanted to kill herself she'd have left a long letter. Or she'd made it so we'd find her before it was too late. Come now, Miss Dubois. Miss Dubois, please... Settle down. Don't get in such a state. I'm a fool, I'm such a fool. No. You're too kind. It's the same thing. Here... They're leaving. Why did Miss Cara say: "I regret doing it"? Chi lo sa? But, I thank the Heavens for not providing the remedy. Oh no, Signorina. You're much too wise for that. Perhaps. Indeed. - What is it? - Let me stay too. Leave me. - Miss, let me stay. - No! I'll stay in the next room. She was my friend! The only person whom I ever loved. And I can't spend the night alone with her? Tomorrow... Tonight I want to be with her. Alone. For the last time. Go away! Go away! Miss Julie! "Mine eye is dim with sorrow. "And all my members are as a shadow. "My days are past. "My purposes are broken, even the thoughts of my heart. "If I wait, "the grave is mine house "I have made my bed in the darkness. "I have said to corruption: 'Thou art my father" "and to the worms: 'Thou art my mother and my sister.' "And where is now my hope? "As for my hope, who shall see it? "They shall go down to the bars of the pit "when our rest together is in the dust." My God... What is it? Who's there? Is it you, Olivia? Why are you here? Come, speak! Get up. My God, you're freezing, my dear. Come. Come warm up. Don't be scared, my dear. It's nothing dreadful. Look how pretty she is. My heart aches. Come. Do you feel better now? Yes. Come quick. Come here. Lift your head. How long were you out there in the cold? Since last night. I wanted to do something for you. My poor... Poor child. Do you feel better, Olivia? Yes. You've regained some color. Go back to your room, now. Listen, Olivia... you may like to know that last night, you saved my life. When I stumbled upon you, I was heading for the cabinet. Signorina hid the key. She doesn't know I have another. - And now? - "Now," no. No. Don't be scared. No. I know one cannot kill oneself without killing many other things around. I've already done enough harm. Trust me, Olivia. What I want above all is not to harm you. Go to bed, now. Don't go to the funeral. Stay in bed. Wrap yourself up in my blanket. You mustn't catch a cold. Go on, dear. Miss Cara is gone. Miss Julie is leaving. I'll never get over it. It's your turn, Gertrude. She gave me a book that she signed. She opened Miss Cara's will. Everything goes to Frau Riesener. And Miss Julie? She's ruined. She'd given Miss Cara everything. Riesener won the game. I've lost everything. Poverina. It's your turn, Olivia. She looks so sad in her big chair. Be strong, Olivia. 2 or 3 years isn't long. You will see. Not for you, who will be with her in Canada. But for me... Don't make a scene, Olivia. Don't, please. I don't intend to make a scene. I've struggled my whole life. But I've always come out on top, and proudly so. And now I wonder, if loosing would not have been best for everyone. You, Olivia, you'll never be a winner. But if you are defeated, when you'll be defeated... What was I saying? I have a migraine. Goodbye. Do you hear? Goodbye! Olivia! I've prepared something for you. A book, I believe. Where did I put it? I don't know. Here. Take this instead. And now go. Tell the next one to come in. Your trunk is packed. I leave tomorrow. And Miss Julie? - Going to Paris. - She'll come back at night? No, she'll stay over the weekend with friends. - You don't need anything? - No. - Good night, Olivia. - Good night. Everyone's leaving. It's better this way. When the school reopens, no one will come back. No. No one. And later, Olivia, well, in a while, you'll see you'll remember us with fondness. -All of us. - I hope so, Victoire. That's how I see it. Although I may be wrong. Here! She said to give you this. You'd forgotten it. Hup! THE END
