GLENN [VOICEOVER]: Theexact location of my island wouldn't mean much to you, so let's just say, it's one of thousands of tiny chunks of land that dot the Pacific. Unfortunately, theisland's not a coral atoll with white, sandy beaches. No, it's the tip of an ancient volcano; steep cliffs, tropicalforests-- what the travel brochures would call exotic. Not a bad place to livethought, as if I had any choice. Sometimes, the interior of my island makes me think of Florida gone wild. I remember, as a kid in Sarasota, trying to clean the oil off seagulls. That was a long time ago, back when everybody was preaching aboutcleaning up the environment. I'm glad that's all over. Florida was a nice enough place to grow up, but man, I would have lovedto have a few of these hills to climb. And caves-- my island's got so many lava tubes running through it, I'll never be able to explore them all. Just about every cave I'veexplored on this island was inhabited at one time or another, mostly by the Polynesians, I guess, a couple thousand years ago. [sighs] Wish I'd learn more about archaeology. Oh, I can figure out exactly howold some of these things are. No, couldn't have been that long ago. It's hard to imagine a timewhen mankind's greatest technological achievementwas molding a hunk of clay with his hands. Well, hello there. Came by to watch me work, huh? OK. I wonder what you're thinking. You know, the experts all said,you weren't thinking anything. But you're still around, aren't you? And where are they about now? Well, make yourself at home, my friend. Let me show you what a couplemillion years of evolution could do for you. If you're lucky, maybe someday, you'll be able to punch the buttonsand make it all work. The electronic age-- that'swhen it all really started. Before then, the only way information could be recorded and storedaway was in books, printing. Now, look at us. Electronic memory cubes. We've stored all of the printed data found in the world's largestlibraries, millions of volumes on a single crystal the size of a match head. Yeah, it's all right here. Not just the libraries, but thephotographs, sound recordings. Films, newsreels, televisionbroadcasts, speeches, wars. Every documented momentin the history of mankind, it's all stored hereforever on, on those crazy, little, synthetic crystals. [electronic light noises] When I think about it, themost incredible job of all must've been indexing this time capsule. Aw, man, you ingenious creature. Setting up those handfulof laser disks-- you know, I remember in school, searching for hours through the card catalogue to locate a few dozen lousy microfilms. Now, look, I couldn't find anyone of several billion items in moments. Just let the old laser index command the computers in microseconds. Now, scan every crystal face, sort it all out, make it all seem to happen again. Of all the millions of categories stored here, there's more information onwars than any other subject. Why not? Humanity is war. Try to find a time periodwhen mankind was at peace. It's fascinating to watch. They believed-- they actuallybelieved that killing off the enemy, dying for their countries could-- could somehow bringpeace into their lives.

As primitive as it all looks here, there were quite a few technicalachievements in the first World War-- submarines, poison gas, liquid fire, armored personnel carriers. [electrical charging noises] But 23 short years made a hell of a difference. The bombers, battleships,anti-aircraft missiles, anti-personnel minefields. World War II must've almost seemed like the war of technology. And then the greatesttechnological achievement of them all-- atomic warfare. It must have seemed unbelievable, back then, the thought that one singlebomb could annihilate 200,000 people in seconds. No wonder people began thinking that Armageddon would be nuclear holocaust. [explosions] [electronic static] Ah, technology in the '60s. Electronics, music, bringing acouple hundred thousand people together for a day or two. HOST [ON TV]: The only Edgar Kelly Band!

[cheering on tv] [electronic static] [whirring sounds] GLENN [VOICEOVER]: And then thewar of the '60s and the '70s. Longest war of all. [explosion] [machine gun fire] They were just kids, kidslearning new tactics, search and destroy, free fire zones,supported by the finest technological weaponry. [explosion] It's hard to believe in 12years of such advanced warfare, only 2 million dead. It's even harder to believe how the world could forget those uncountedmillions who died inside. Ha. It seems so logical. All this way through the orderly computer. People never could buy the ideaof history repeating itself, not really. With nuclear technology so real and common, how could they help butoverlook the laughable threat of Nazi-ism? [gun shots] My father probably would'vebelieve that this happened during World War II, 1945, instead of 1986, the year of the great war. One few people evenrealized was being fought, the ultimate war of technology. [coughing] [coughing] The simple execution of a handful of international dignitaries,world leaders, and alike. One very small atrocity in the overall battle. But it was also the move that nearly destroyed the aggressor's plans. Some of the battle fieldsweren't so unpleasant. [wind instrument playing] Ahmid, would you find out of Major Chin Lee has arrived here? Why don't you join me? You can see better over here. I was just trying tofigure out how to do that without appearing too forward? [laughing] Thank you. Mhm. My name's Liz Bennett. Glenn Manning. Hi Glenn. Hi. Unbelievable, isn't it? You know, I tried to do that at a party once, but uh, mm, well, I'd neverseen the real thing before. I think you could do with a little less bump, and a little more grind. You've got to practice muscle control. Oh. Why don't I give you alesson a little later tonight? You're going to teach me belly dancing? Mm, muscle control. Mr. Manning, your bus withMajor Lee and the other delegates has not yet arrived. All right. Thank you, Ahmid. Now, bring the ladyanother drink, would you? Well, uh, when do I get my lesson? GLENN: Later. There's something else I've got to do first. Excuse me. And this is the only place theycould have come through, huh? That's right, sir. But I wouldn't worry about the delay. As VIP, they probably took aside tour of the barricades along the line. Any chance of my goinginside and tracking them down? No, sir. If anything was wrong, theair patrol would report it. Maybe you're right. I'll wait back at the hotel. [engine roaring] GLENN [VOICEOVER]:Manning, just another one of the troops in the great war-- a war where you couldn't always becertain who the enemy was. [electronic whirring noise] Well, my dear Mr. Norris,of all the stupidities, irresponsibilities, andincompetent decisions that have been made by your operative here, have placed us in a very embarrassing situation. Well, Norris, is there any reason I shouldn't have you replaced immediately? And this, this, uh, agent, locked up? Now, wait a minute. There was something there. Norris, I will not listen to any more of his ridiculous excuses. That story has been proven false. MAJOR LEE: The bus was delayed. Major Lee? The bus was delayed by a flat tire. I had no payments to make. This meeting is adjourned. And Norris, I'll expect a fullfile on Manning this afternoon. Then maybe we can reach some decision. Might be a good idea tokeep him on ice for a while. Now, damn it Al, I didn't make it up. The bus was empty. There wasn't anyone within a mile of it. Shut up, Manning. I don't give a damn if you found a bomb in the middle of Time's Square. You screwed up. All right. I know I should've waitedbefore going inside the zone. But something happened in there, and they're trying to cover it up. And 37 international highpowers say it was a flat tire. Look, Manning, you screwed upfive years ago when you took that Russian out of Yugoslavia. But this time, you've createdan international incident. That's not bad for 20 years. What the hell am I going to do with you? What about the Lucifer problem? Lucifer? What's that? It may be nothing. But three of our planes have vanished somewhat mysteriously, all offthe coast of South America. They're going to check into it. He is qualified for surveillance flights. [airplane engine taking off] PILOT: Mayday, mayday, [choppy radio dialogue] AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER: Air borne to the tower. Uh, you're breaking up. Could you repeat? PILOT: Mayday, mayday. [inaudible]. Mayday. AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER: [inaudible], and you're still breaking up. I'm trying to get a fix on you. PILOT: Mayday. AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER:812, why don't you eject? [signal cutting out] AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER: 812, eject! Eject! [explosion] MAN IN THE DISTANCE: You said move. [inaudible]. [chatter in distance] [dog barking] [barking] [growling] [barking] [barking] Mr. Manning? Yeah, that's better. Now, just relax, eh? Just relax. Oh, there's nothing to worry about. Just a bump on the head and a twisted ankle. You'll be as good as new in a couple of days. Where? You're in the Pensacola Naval Hospital. I'm Dr. Bernard Vogel. You were brought in lastnight by a naval rescue team. A bit delirious from the bump on your head, but I'd say you'll survive. Now, hop into your chair, andwe'll take you to your room. Is there a phone in my room? I've got to call my office. Your office has already been notified. Someone is flying down fromWashington this afternoon. How about a guided tour as we go along, eh? This facility is one of the best. A great amount of highly specialized research is done here, as well as treatment. And in here is one of the mostmodern research laboratories in the world. And down there, the pediatric research for-- Doctor, I tell you, I'm really turned on by all this technical expertise that's available for the bump on my head and my ankle, but uh, no offense, can we save it for later? Um, of course. Take Mr. Manning to his room. ADMIN [ON OVERHEAD]: Mr. Kostowski, [inaudible] line one. [electronic static] [electronic beeping sounds] ADMIN [ON OVERHEAD]: Emergency room. Dr. O'Brien. Glenn? Julie. Come on in. Is Al with you? No, he's still tied up inthat Middle East problem. But he told me to tell you to take it easy for a few days andnot to give the doctors and nurses too much trouble. Julie, I've got to talk to Al. I saw something very strange after I crashed. But I was supposed to get the report and bring it back with me. OK. It's going to be hard to believe. JULIE: Mhm. I'm ready. What would you think of Nazisoldiers and native slaves, for starters? [coughing] Uh, Mr. Manning? I didn't mean to eavesdrop,but I'm glad I overheard. I should've explained this morning that in your delirious state, you kept talking about the Nazis. Miss Simmons brought yourmedical file with her. And you were, you were capturedby the Germans during the war? Yeah. It was my first mission. I blew it. I think what happened wasuh, in your delirium, the bump on your head, and all, you kepthaving nightmares about being captured by the Nazis again. That sort of thing fits. And [inaudible]. You were on a mission in the Yucatan last year. Yeah, I guess you're right. Well, I guess my report isn't going to be that exciting, after all. Would you please excuse us, doctor? Top secret and all that, you know? Uh, of course. Um, I'll look in on you a little later, eh? All right. GLENN [RECORDING]: Are you readyfor another dull, routine, run of the mill report? Obviously, Vogel's drug didnot block Mr. Manning's memory of what he saw on the surface. It'll be an interesting challenge to get the Chin Lee information. But we will accomplish our purpose. [electronic beeping sounds] [alarm beeping] Huh? Oh. [panting] Oh. Ah! [tv noises] [alarm beeping] Oh. Grab her! Stay back, or so help me, I'll use this! Just stay back. Strap her! Ah! Just stay back. OK. OK, OK. DR. VOGEL: Mr. Manning, Mr.Manning, are you all right? Are you all right? Mr. manning! Yeah, I'm fine. DR. VOGEL: We'll take a minute to get the key. Be careful! Your visitor is dangerously deranged. Don't worry. I won't cause any trouble. [panting] Here. Why don't you give me that, huh? Never. I'm not going to let them put one of those monsters inside of me. Come on. Give it to me. No!. See the bed? Take that bed and move it against the door. Bed? You heard me, the bed. Now, quickly. [gasp] Ah. Ah. Ah! [gasp] You dirty, rotten Nazi! You're just like the rest of them. Well, I don't know about the rest of them, but I'm a patient here. I've been in here a couple days. Uh-- you're the pilot? I-- I saw the crash. [inaudible]. What, you were near the island? Don't you know? We're on the island. Well, that's impossible. This is Pensacola. No. What did you mean about the others being Nazis? That's what they are. You mean with swastikas, like that? The guards wear uniforms and everything, just like in World War II. Well, what about the natives? They're prisoners too. They treat them just like slaves. Like slaves? I'm glad you have her under control. Take her back to her room. No. Ah! I'm terribly sorry this had to happen. That poor girl, she belongsin the psychiatric ward. I hope it wasn't too upsetting. No, no, no. I've been in worse situations. Of course. But um, I think just in case, give Mr. Manning a sedative, eh? And now, I'd better see to that poor girl, eh? Good night. Ah! ADMIN [ON OVERHEAD]: Marshall, radiology. Nurse Warsaw, radiology. Intern to nursing station. Intern to nursing station. Oh, excuse me. [electronic beeping noises] [grunt] [bell chime] April? April. April, come on. Wake up. Wake up, April. Wake up. April, come on. Wake up. April, wake up. It's you. Come on, get up. It's you. We were both right about the Nazis. [inaudible] The diagnosis of the situationis correct, Mr. Manning. You cannot get out. However, I assure you,you have not seen enough. Do be my guest. I promise you that you will be most impressed. Guards? Bring Mr. Manning in here so that we can instruct him on exactlyhow this process takes place. [glass breaking] Don't let them get away! Ah! [alarm ringing] Get them! Get them! APRIL: Hit the first button. Ah! Look, if we can get to thesurface, we can get some help. Welcome to the new world, Mr. Manning. Don't be in such a hurry to get away. Allow me to introduce myself. I am Obershoya Gerhardt Frog. This is my assistant, Frau Bruener. And of course, you know here, Dr. Vogel. You have destroyedvaluable equipment, Manning. It will take us weeks to put it back in shape, before we can completethe cloning of Miss Adams. You will have sufficient time here, Doctor, to deal with Miss Adams and withour super agent, Mr. Manning. Ah, he is a fine working specimen, isn't he? So you see, Mr. Manning, theFourth Reich is a reality. And through cloning, we arebuilding a new master race. That's what little, old me stumbled into? [laughing] No, Mr. Manning. You didn't stumble into anything. You were pushed. Haven't you wondered aboutMiss Simmon's visits? Not really. I figured she was one of your people when I realized I wasn't at Pensacola. She was the one who suggested you be given the Lucifer assignment. I wish you girls wouldhave been there to see it. Glen destroyed some of their most valuable equipment. Look, girls, I know that he can really help us. But Greta, I have to knowthat you and the girls are 100% behind us. Absolutely, 100%. You and Chin Lee had business together. We need to know what that was. Well, with all your superscience, that should be easy. Why don't you try truth serum? We tried that when we first brought you here. But you and I both know you wereprogrammed with false report. We can't get past that. Adams? Take her. Now, little lady, you tellus what we want to know. Really, Miss Adams. It would be wise to cooperate. Once Kraus gets started,it's difficult to persuade him to ease off. Ah. Ah. You went in Manning's room, and he foolishly tried to rescue you. Obviously, you two talked. What did he say? Nothing. I-- we were running. We didn't have to-- he didn't say anything. He didn't mention the name, Chin Lee? Who? You know who. You're lying. Ah! Chin Lee had only one partof the information we want. And you think I've got the other part, huh? Well, sorry. Chin Lee never got a chanceto tell me what he was into. You boys moved in with thebus switch before I did. I do not believe you! You will give us the information we want! Yeah, send two men in hereto take Mr. Manning to Vogel, and have Ralph Bruener bring Miss Adams to join us in the infirmary. Ya, immediately! We will get the information we want. I told you! I don't know anything! We were trying to escape! He didn't tell me anything. I'm sorry. You shouldn't have become angry. I understand. You're afraid. No harm will come to you. In fact, if you will only cooperate, your stay here could become quite pleasant. You make me sick. I'd rather be dead. You may well wish for death by the time they're finished with you. Take her to Probe. He knows what to do with her. Aren't you coming? I'll come in a moment. Adams couldn't have gotten to Manning some of the others knowing. I'll stay and find out whoelse was in on the plot. Yeah. Now, who else must be punished? Very soon, our futiledream will become a reality. Too bad the old boy isn't around to see it. You underestimate theindestructible superiority of the true Aryan. You're kidding? No, I'm not joking. [hitler recordings] Ah, good. Now, I think we have the keyto unlock Manning's memory. Bring her inside. Well, that's impossible. He'll be in his 80s by now. That's impossible. You Americans. You will never-- Yes, you, Greta. You have caused the most trouble. Vogel. You, man, check the halls. Ah! [inaudible]. [inaudible]. [gun shot] Oh. Oh! Ah. Don't just stand there. Sound the alarm! We have the building surrounded. Any attempt to escape is futile. Looks like we may have tooshoot our way out of here. Hope you know how to use this. Come out with your hands up, and your life will be spared, Manning. I will give you 30 seconds. Think of the fraulein, if not on yourself. 30 seconds! Don't you worry about me. Now, I know how to use this. I want you men to attackthe infirmary at my order. But Dr. Vogel may still be alive. To hell with Vogel. I want Manning. Your time is up, Manning. Try and take him alive. [door knock] [door knock] Greta. We got infirmary. OK. On my signal, open fire. We'll scatter Faub's forces now. [gun shots] Sounds like the cavalry to the rescue. We have to smash our way out of here. Smash out? Well, can you uh, handle a tank? A tank? Yes, uh, Faub has this private war souvenir on the other side of the camp. OK. [inaudible] [gun shots] Ah! Climb on the barracks. Here. We're going to make a run forit to the end of the camp. You'll never make it. They'll spot you from the towers. Well, that's the chance I'll have to take. They're going to make astand in the staff building. Some of you girls go on thebarracks right behind us. I saw April and someoneinside the infirmary doorway. Well, keep that staffbilling under heavy fire. It's their only chance. Klaus, take some men, get around behind them. Yeah. [speaking german] [gun shots] [explosion] Oh, my god. It's April. I see her. [machine gun fire] Damn it! Where is that fool, Kraus? Why doesn't he stop them? Ah. [inaudible] You've set up a barricade. [gun fire] Moshmann, Meuller, you come with me. We'll bring up the half track and crush them, one way or another. Moshmann, you maintain the position here. Don't do anything to draw their fire. One shot into this petrol,and you'll be cinders. Come on, let's go. You drive. [engine running] [explosion] SOLDIER: Ah! [explosion] Ah. Damn it, Kraus! Are we to be defeated by ahandful of simpering females? Manning crashed through therear gates with your tank. They're going to get to the explosives. [glass breaking] It's our only chance. Then do it now! [explosions] [gun shots] Ah. [explosion] SOLDIER: Ah. [german soldiers speaking] Hold your positions! I'll get the explosives andput a stop to all of this! [explosions] LADY: Ah. [gun shots] All right, girls, come on. [gun shot] SOLDIER: Ah! [explosions] [tank engine roaring] [choking noises] Ah! Kraus! [gun fire] Ah! SOLDIER: Ah! [explosion] SOLDIER: Ah! [gun fire] SOLDIER: Ah! Ah! SOLDIER: Ah! [gun fire] SOLDIER: Ah! Ah. [explosion] Ah! Ah! [explosion] [grunting] [gasp] Thank god it's you. If I had run into any more Nazis, I would have run out places to put them. All right. Gather up the rest of thewomen, and meet us by the tank. Just bought us a ticket out of this place. [inaudible] [grunting] SOLDIER: Ah! [flames burning] Move along, [inaudible]. You're behaving just fine. MAN [OLD, CROAKEY VOICE]: Ithink that's fine, [inaudible], Robert. It is time [inaudible] I meet face to face. Bring him to my chamber. Shall we go? Wait a minute. Here, take this. Stop anybody from trying to get in. -Right. -All right. [electronic laser-like sounds] GLENN [VOICEOVER]: That's impossible. He'd be in his 80s by now. FAUB [VOICEOVER]: You underestimate the indestructablesuperiority of the two Aryans. Greetings, [inaudible]. You are to be congratulated. You have won the battle. But unfortunately, foryou, you have lost the war. Come forward, and let's meet, face to face. On the surface, you have destroyed the camp and inflicted many casualties. But let me assure you that this is the only a temporary inconvenience. The Fourth Reichcontinues to move forward. As for you, Flaubert, you area disgrace to your uniform. Your bungling is unforgivable! You no longer of any use to the Reich. [high-pitched laser sound] [gasp] [gun shot] Sir Manning. We were first with the V2,first with our superior weapons of war. We are the master race. [gun shots] I suggest you save your strengthfor someone more your equal. [high pitched electronic echo] My god, you do look like me. All right, stay back. Ah. [struggling noises] Ah! Ah. [fighting noises] Ah! Get out. Get back. [grunting & punching] [electrocution noises] Stop. Get over by him. Will you stop fooling around? We've got to finish this job and get out of here. How do I know which one is you? I'm the real one. [electronic pulse noises] Will you listen to me? I'm the real one! Well, so I found out. I didn't shoot at you. When I saw the laser pointed at you, I knew they wouldn't destroy a clone. [gun shot] So you're the one. Do you realize what you have done? Stay back! Years of work, millions of dollars, destroyed! And along with it, your dreamsof tomorrow of the world, huh? We already have enough control to succeed. Key leaders throughout theworld have been replaced. Nothing will stop us. There will be a warless takeover by my clones. Not now? I have opened the sea gate. GLENN: You're insane. What you think doesn't really matter. [german]. [electronic pulsing noises] [waves crashing] [electronic pulsing noises] Oh, what about him? He's had it. Come on. We've got to get off thisisland, before it goes. GLENN [VOICEOVER]: Thedestruction of the island is only the beginning. [electronic whirring noises] Ladies and gentlemen, it has just been confirmed. The island has been destroyed completely. GLENN [VOICEOVER]: Thetechnology of war developed past the point of no return. Mankind now mass produced human beings, clones, duplicates, living beings. Therefore, it is our duty to carry on. We hold the future of mankind in our hands. GLENN [VOICEOVER]: Carryingout orders without questions, destroying the opposition. Exact human duplicates, without humanity. [electronic noises] Well, it's all here. The rise and fall of mankind. Some day, maybe 100 years fromnow, 10,000 years from now, some explorers from another planet will discover this time capsule, and-- ah, but I can't wait around. [sighs] I've got my island to explore. [birds chirping]
