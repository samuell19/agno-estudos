Can't you just be normal like everyone else? Why would I? You're my brother and you love me. Why should I be like everyone else? Not like everyone else. Just more relaxed and less dark and aggressive. - Dark and aggressive? - Yeah. You are dark sometimes. - Everyone has a little darkness in them. - No, they don't. - Yes, they do. - No. - Yes. - I don't. Yes, you do, you're just too boring to know it. You know what your problem is? You don't like anyone. You don't like people. Johan, I am a person. How can I not like myself? No really, how can one not like oneself? Want some? Why not? - Why not? - I don't have any money. - You can borrow. - No. - You can borrow! - No. - Do you want one? - No. - Why not? - I just don't want it. What's going on with the light? Hey, asshole! Stop pointing Hey! Carl wants to see you upstairs! Me? Why? Now! - You're Emil? - Yes. It's nice to meet you. How long have you been with us? I'm not exactly sure, about 5-7 years. - 5-7? That's a lot. - Yes. That's a long time. - And you're happy and satisfied? - I'm okay, yeah. That's good. Where do you see yourself in let's just say 5-7 years? I don't know working here, maybe? Children? Uhm, I don't know. Maybe. - So you do have a girlfriend? - Yes. - Is she beautiful? - What? Is your girlfriend beautiful? Yes, she's very beautiful. 'Cause you're not very good-looking yourself. Or are you? Do you think you're a good-looking boy? Okay. So you want to work here for the next 5-7 years - and have a child with a beautiful girl and be happy and content. Can I write that? - Write? - Hm? "Emil wants to work here in the factory for at least 5-7 years more. He wants a child with a beautiful girl, and more than anything - - he wants to be happy and content." "... happy and content." How does that sound? Good? Are you a thief, Emil? No, I'm not. Then why does this report state you're a thief? I don't know. I don't know anything about a report. Then read it. It says three things. First, that your name is Emil. Secondly, that you're a thief. And thirdly, that you've worked hard for us for 5-7 years - and want a child with a beautiful girl and want to be a happy and content boy. Can I go now? Homebrew. Did we forget something in the report? Did we? Hand me the report. Peter. Thank you, Peter. Post scriptum. "I steal chemicals from the factory I work in. I brew toxic liquor and sell it to my co-workers." Plus... "I'm a murderer." Is this some sort of joke? You didn't know? One of my best employees is dying in the hospital as we speak. Because of your brew. Is that a joke? Do you think I'm joking? You're not going to drink with me? One little drink won't kill you. But the whole bottle might. Are you awake? I want you, Emil. I want you, too. I want to eat you. Would you like me to eat you? Yes. - Say 'yes, please'. - Yes, please. Would you like to eat me? Yes. I want to eat you. I want to be loved and fucked. I love you. I'm yours. I will love and fuck you all day - every day for the rest of your life. Do you love me? Yes. Thank you. Don't. I'm sleeping. Good night. I said good night. Hey. Stop. Stop it. Come on, stop. I hate you! Calm down! I hate you! Calm down! She was mine! Emil. Emil? Emil? Emil... Hey... hey! Emil! Emil, come on... Come on! Emil! I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry... I'm sorry... Emil! What's up? I'd like to buy a bottle. I'm going to tell you a story. Okay? So listen up. It's about a man, who worked here years ago, and his dog. It's a true story, and it happened right here. Probably before you were born. So this man had a dog. His wife hated dogs. She hated all animals, but with this dog... ...it was different because it was special. It followed him everywhere. They walked together through the quarry and the forest to the factory. On this particular day... ...the man was to do tunnel work, so he said to the dog: "Stay here." "Stay." The dog sat down, and it stayed. "Good dog," the man said. "Good dog." And he went underground. What the dog didn't know was that, on that day, the tunnel collapsed. Many workers died, among them its owner. The dog sat there and waited. But nothing happened. The man didn't come back up. The other workers tried to make the dog go home, but it wouldn't. It became aggressive. So they left it there. And there it sat. It didn't eat anything or drink anything. And after a few days it lied down and a few days later it stopped breathing. My father told me that story. I don't know... ...what to make of it. How about you? No. Sometimes I don't quite know... ...what's right. I don't always understand... Kinda like with this story. Do you understand? - Get lost. And stay away. - But Daniel, I work... Emil! ...within the hour, or I'll find another supplier. Emil. Are you sleeping? I'll randomly shuffle this pile. You get to decide if I shuffle with more or fewer cards. Okay. - So more or fewer cards? - More. - Like this? - Uh... yes. A few more. - Can I pick just one card? - Like this? - Yes, like that. - You can have whatever you want. - Are we done? You decide. - Okay, then we're done. So the police throw each group of people into each their cell - - so that there won't be any trouble. - How did you do that? - I'm not exactly sure. - It's great. - Thanks. It's magic. I want to show you one that I think you'll really like. Okay? - Yes. - Sure? Yes. - You'd better put these on. - Is it dangerous? Could be. Careful... - What now? - Shh. Starring
