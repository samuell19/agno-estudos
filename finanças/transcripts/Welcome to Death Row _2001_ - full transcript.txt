(dramatic music) (opera music) - We're on location tonight in the NWA Ruthless Studios here to talk to NWA and Eazy E, probably the most controversial rap group in Los Angeles. - At that time, all the rappers were claiming their home towns. South Bronx, you know, wherever they may be, New York, Queens, whatever the case may be. We were from Compton! - Coming up in the ghetto, period, builds character to me. You know what I'm saying? It definitely can build character if you use it in a positive way. - We're seeing regular homies from the neighborhood that was just putting down real street raps. It made us feel like we could do it. - Something really special was coming out of that neighborhood. It was a fresh, really volatile time in music. I liken it to Elvis Presley when rock and roll started to when the Beatles came. It was something really special coming out of there. - After a while, Michael Jackson didn't work. People didn't believe the hype. We didn't care. We didn't care. They didn't feel it with all the trying to be shy nonsense. People ain't checking for that no more. Rap made it gritty. - I think we're successful because we tell it like it is and that's what people wanna hear because they're sick of hearing about fairy tales and stuff like that. - NWA to me was like anti-establishment. - They was bringing South Central to the forefront and what was happening, and drugs, and the whole shine. They was fitting another element of society that nobody else had touched on. - They talked about being gangsters. Gangsta Gangsta was a big hit. Fuck Tha Police was a big hit. - It's not what you know, it's what you can prove. - When I went and got NWA albums, I bought them as a fan. - You'd just see an all-star cast of people. Eazy being the mastermind, Cube being the rhyme writer, Dre laying down the tracks, the producer, and then you have Ren who played supporting cast. And that just made up one of the great groups of hip-hop. - We don't tell you what to do and won't tell you what not to do. You got your own freedom of choice. - [Doug] Eazy represented, you know, the hardcore little gangster on the corner. - They try to hold us back because this record has cursing on it. Said something, oh you talking about raping somebody and everything. - People were selling cocaine, making a lot of money, and he was the first person that actually came out and admitted it and boasted about it on a record. - That's bullshit. (laughter) - Eazy E turned out to have some business savvy. - Eazy was a local crack slinger. Made him some money, and because I was one of the few guys he knew in the studio, he wanted to get with me and get in the studio. He was not intended to be a rapper. He was gonna be a financier. Dre was producing for Alonzo of Kru-Cut Records and the Wreckin' Crew. Dre started getting in the trouble. He was going to jail for warrants on a regular basis. I'm digging in my pocket to get him out. So I got to the point when I got tired of it, and Alzono didn't get him out of jail. Eazy got him out of jail. When Eric got him out of jail, they cut a deal that Dre would do some tracks for Eric in my studio. And they hooked up and was boys ever since then. - [Eazy] You put the dot on your target and then blow the shit out the motherfucker. No joke. - Eazy knew it was like a joke to him. It was like (makes giggling noises), but he got so far into it, it was like, okay, I am this. I'm walking to the Carson Mall, I look up in the HQ which is a sporting goods store and a gun store, and these guys are being semi-automatic weapons to go on tour with! I'm like, shit! What kind of tour are you guys going on? Vietnam or what? - They were selling out the back of cars and they were making money and they were going to the top one way or another. - We used to ride around in Eazy's jeep all day and sell records to what they call swap meets out here. I used to make people buy records. - [Man] How'd you make them buy it? - With a gun. - Eazy paid Lonzo to introduce him to Jerry Heller. - Jerry Heller was basically Dr. Dre and Eric Wright's manager and label head. - Ruthless started from Eazy-E. Eazy-E knew that Dre was a dope producer. He did the Straight Outta Compton album. He did Eazy Does It. He did Michel'le's album. He did the DOC's album. - Dr. Dre was one of these guys that could take this raw street sound, and turn it into the kind of magic that would hit a wide audience of kids. - They had a method that clearly was heard and felt by young people. - All over the country, they had pockets of young brothers who sold dope and had to carry nine millimeter pistols, who had a wad of money that could relate. - Every kid wants something that's sort of forbidden. Certainly this type of imagery was. In fact, they couldn't even hear it on their regular radio station. - They sold over 1,000,000 albums. And we have to understand that with rap music, past 500,000, 600,000 albums, you go outside the black community. - They had little while kids out there that grew up in pop's country club. They wasn't having it. They wanted to hear NWA. - It became clear that there weren't just 10,000 kids listening to this. There was hundreds of thousands in each city. - People sat back and seeing an album that sold 1,000,000 units. It never played on radio. And I had to question myself, how does this happen? How did this happen? What went on here? - Now, when it starts making real money, and it starts looking like some success is gonna come about, that's when the shit starts. Eazy and Jerry wasn't paying Dr. Dre enough money. - At that time, I was owed money but they wasn't paying it. You know what I'm saying? I think they were trying to starve me out. As hard as you work for your money, there's at least two or three people out there working just as hard to get it from you. - I was there when Dre told me he would sell his soul to the devil for 1,000,000 bucks. And I swear right now, devil gotta have a receipt for his ass. - Suge Knight was always around. He was around in the days of NWA. I just never noticed who he was. - Suge was just a big kid. He was really, at that time, totally nobody. - Suge Knight was a body guard, body guarding Bobby Brown. - Being a body guard is probably one of the best music schools, music industry schools that you could go to, because you're gonna learn everything about the business. - I was out there looking and learning. And I seen the different people complain. I seen artists. I seen people trying to be artists. I seen people talk about songs, and I'm just listening. I'm hearing it all. - He was an aggressive person that cleared the way for me to go in and do what I had to do. You know, by any means necessary. - Suge was a leader and he was a winner. He's smart. He kinda remind me of a a hip-hop Dick Griffey. - In the 1980s, Solar was probably the most successful black-owned record label in America. Dick Griffey, who was the founder of the company, was one of those men. He had the rare ability, I think, to identify talent in people. - What I'm interested in is, is really, teaching young people how to be in business for themselves. - Suge first came to see Dick because he was managing a young guy named Mario Johnson, PK Chocolate, who had written a number of songs on a Vanilla Ice album. - I did all of his songs at his kitchen table at his house. Me and Quake would do tracks and I would go to his house and write and give him songs, and he would learn them. - He had got some credit on the album, but they hadn't paid him. They wouldn't return his phonecalls. - I couldn't get in contact with them, but the record wasn't doing anything at that time, and when the video hit BET is when the record start taking off. - The thing happened so fast and it blew up so quick, the first thing they wanted to do is tell me look, we'll give you a couple dollars. You know, let bygones be bygones. I was like, I wasn't going for it. - Suge came to me at the Palm restaurant. First, he just had down and said hello. He was kinda nice, you know. It kinda scared us 'cause he was really intimidating. He had six or seven guys with him that looked like a football team. - We already knew where he was staying because I was supposed to be hearing some tracks that he was doing, but for some reason, they wanted me to just come by myself. You know what I'm saying? And Suge was like, why they just want you to go by yourself? They already tried to beat you out of money. They done beat you out of songs. I'm going with you. - They whole attitude probably was look, we was gon' go in there and tell them, we gon' do it like this and give him a check, and he gon' shut up. I had a different program when we met. - One day I went to my hotel room and he was in there, and he was with several people. Then he let me know what he wanted, and he wanted to get some points off of the record Ice Ice Baby. - I'm like, look, you can't give me nothing. It's what I'ma give you because you didn't get the rights to put it out there because I haven't got paid and my client haven't got paid. - I remember watching Prime Time Live, the interview with Vanilla Ice. - Suge took me out on the balcony, started talking to me personally. He had me look over the edge, show me how high I was up there. - [Suge] You scared? - I needed to wear a diaper on that day. He didn't, first of all, hang me off from any balcony or any of this stuff. The story's been blown out of proportion, and I wanna clarify right now that Suge and I have no bad feelings or anything towards each other. - We had to sue BMI and Winkle to recover that money. - And it was more than a year in the settlement of that law suit, that Chocolate finally got paid. Doesn't mean he didn't get hung over the balcony. But if he did, it didn't make him go pay. - You can look at it like, like I was an investor in Death Row Records with no return on my money. - Suge said, well, you know, I've got some other clients who also have written songs and produced records, and they haven't been paid either. - He shows up on my doorstep with these two guys called DOC and Dre. DOC was the storyteller. The D-O-C was the guy that came up with those great stories. He was probably the single most influential person in gangsta rap. - Dre basically made Ruthless Records. I mean, he did the music, he was the one who knew how to work with the artists, and it must've been him and Eazy's company together. And then when Eazy met Jerry, Jerry came in and x'd Dre out, and said Eric, I'll give you a little bit more money. We'll just use Dre basically as a slave. - They had the worst contracts I've ever seen in the history of the record business. Contracts that Ruthless and Jerry Heller had with NWA and Dre, I guess if I said draconian, that would be a kind word. - In the process of having a number of conversations with DOC and Dre, the question came up about how can we be assured that we're gonna get paid in the future? Dick said look, Dre, if you can make records the way you make records, I'll show you how to start a company. You won't have to worry about people paying you. You'll have a company that you own and control. I suggested that, why don't you guys go and talk to Eazy and see if you can make a deal while Dre continues to produce Eazy for Ruthless. He continues to produce NWA and the other acts. - I was consulting for Ruthless for Eazy-E working through Jerry Heller. One day, Dre came with Suge to my office in Hollywood and simply said they had left Ruthless, were starting their own company called Death Row Records. - It didn't go down the way it was supposed to, and so Eazy had to be persuaded to make some moves and make things happen. According to court papers, Suge and friends basically came in and told Eric and Jerry Heller Dre was leaving and they couldn't stop him, and that this was not just legal, it was physical. It was personal. The stories that Eric told was that they came in with baseball bats, threatened gun-- - And the threat of his life in telling him that he would kill his mother and they were holding me hostage. And those kinds of duress got him to sign releases for Dr. Dre. - I wasn't there. I wasn't in the room, but when Eazy-E said in the papers that me and the chairman of Sony, Tommy Mottola, was in the room with bats and pipes, he's obviously a liar. - There's no question that we have substantial documentary evidence of the conspiracy here. - Eric Wright, Eazy-E filed a RICO lawsuit against them. It was the first time RICO had been used in the music business. RICO's a racketeering lawsuit. It's the thing that they use to get the mafia, and they can't get the mafia leaders on anything else. - Eazy-E's lawsuit contended that there was money laundering, extortion, threats, and violent intimidation. Not only was it charged against Suge and Death Row for stealing what was their top producer, Dr. Dre, it was a charge against Sony Music. From day one, this label was born amidst a controversy that involved violence. - The initial understanding was that DOC and Dre and Dick and Suge would be partners in this company. - Each one of our artists that started with us at the beginning, I got a lot of love for and they always will be a part of the family, on the strength that they took that chance. It's not like that, it's, we had a name out there. It's not like we had a lot of money to give them. The money I gave came out my pocket. - Back then, Suge was like Berry behind the scenes and helpful and quiet. Humble, non-visible. He didn't like cameras. He was invisible. The invisible man. - His role was to handle the day to day business dealing with the artists, dealing with distributors and record companies and what have you. My job was to go in here and push these buttons and make the records happen. - Everybody was following Dre, because people knew that Dre was the man. Like, everything that he touched was like, gold or platinum or better. - That's why everyone wanted to work with him. He was actually the most bankable person at that time pretty much in the industry, from the R&B/rap standpoint. - Everybody was taking direction from Dre as far as he knows what he's doing. He's just finished doing NWA album that's double and triple platinum, so you have to have confidence in what you see. You watch this man make money. - Warren G was my best friend and Nate Dogg was my best friend. So we formed 8213 and Warren G was a DJ, I was a rapper, and Nate Dogg would sing the hooks. We didn't have drums machines back then. All we had was wreckers and turntables and a microphone. When Warren G called me on the three-way like, Snoop, I got Dre on the phone, cuz. He liked the tape. He wanna work with us, cuz. He wanna work with us. Like, nigga, stop lying. And he said, hello. I said, who this? He said it's Dre. He said man, that shit was dope, man. I wanna get with you. Come to the studio Monday. - At that time, it was a dream just to be in the same room with Dr. Dre, you know? Dr. Dre wants us to come to the studio where he is. I'd jog up there if I didn't have a car. - I wanted to appreciate the game and to accept everything that was offered to me and learn, and just be a student at the time. - They were housed in my building, so they didn't have a lot of expenses. You have to understand that the greatest expense in making a record is the studio time. I didn't have a lot of knowledge about the rap or hip-hop scenario, so I kinda let them do their own thing. - Some nights we used to stay up there all night. We didn't leave until like five, six in the morning. I mean, they had a special vibe up there. You just wanted to be there. Even if you wasn't working on a song, you just wanted to be there because it had that atmosphere. It was just was the spot to be at. It was right in the middle of Hollywood and, you know, it was just a place to be for us. And we was young, and we never really had been out of the neighborhood. And was getting a chance to see it all in bright lights. And this was the same studio that Shalamar, Lakeside, The Whispers, Babyface, The Deal. All of them recorded their albums in this same studio. - On a business level and on a day to day basis, it was merely existing. Seemed like they were trying to find somebody to put some money into it, or somebody to help them out. - Money was hard to come by back then, because it wasn't no structure. It was not label. Suge Knight did all he could do at the time, as far as you know, going in his pocket, his bank account, to get us money. Dre didn't really have no money. He was leaving NWA. (piano playing) (hip-hop music) - Dick had made a deal with Suge, DOC, and Dre to sell him a recording studio that he owned. That was gonna be something that they would own separate from the Death Row label because they wanted to have something that they own. Suge came along and said he had found somebody to help them finance the purchase of the studio. - It's always been a subjecting speculation where they got their original funding. And the FBI's continuing to look into this. - There are so many things you hear about this situation. I tell you this, Mike Harris was firmly planted in the middle of it. - On the news, they used to call Mike the Godfather. - Tonight, the story of a man who tried to murder his best friend at the same time he was attempting to win his way into Beverley Hills' acceptance. - [Voiceover] This is Michael Harris, a man drug agents describe as a major cocaine trafficker. At the young age of 26, he had already made millions of dollars. These are his roots, the streets of South Central, Los Angeles, where he started pushing dope on street corners, and hung with the blood street gang called the Bounty Hunters. In the drug world, he is known as Harry-O. - Mike Harris was a known entity in our community. He was this guy bigger than life, because Mike Harris was in jail doing things. - Prior to his incarceration, he was very visible. He had started doing numerous things in the community. - [Voiceover] Harris built an organization that distributed cocaine in California, Arizona, Texas, Michigan, Illinois, Iowa, Indiana, Missouri, Louisiana, Florida, and New York. Investigators say he dealt so much cocaine, major Colombian drug kingpins like Mario Villabona were obliged to deal directly with Harris. But like a mob godfather, Harris sought to legitimize his illicit fortune and gain Beverley Hills' respectability. - Mike Harris had a wonderful background in entertainment. I think he was the first African-American ever to produce a broadway show that was a smash and it gave Denzel Washington his start. - Checkmate was the name of the play. The play opened on Broadway. Many of us African-Americans have been on Broadway, on the screen, out front singing and dancing, but very few of us had been there as producers. - I thought he was an entrepreneur in New York. Had no idea that he was in jail. - The first time I met Michael, it was a drug case involving Bo Bennett, Mario Villabona. That trial went and resulted in a number of convictions that went to trial in a federal court, and after that case, Michael, I believe contacted David Kenner to have him represent him on his appeal. - David Kenner was a long-time Los Angeles criminal attorney, and by the late 80s, he had become part of a fraternity of top flight attorneys that handled a lot of federal cases. A lot of big drug cases downtown. In the course of his legal work, he became Michael Harris' attorney. I think if you look at clients of his over time, David has a habit of getting very close to his clients and getting very involved in his clients' lives. Perhaps more so than would be wise for a lawyer. - David just, you now, fell in love with Michael. And they became friends. He was a friend to us. I looked at him like family. I was out in LA by myself, and he took me in, you know. Him and his family, we'd go out to eat. I mean, we would like, do everything together. - He became someone who was a confidant, a friend of Michael Harris' and also involved in business with Michael Harris. - I think that he's a lawyer who had a lot of money and he represented people who had a lot of money and it would not be unusual to me for somebody who represented people with money to say, I wanna invest. Everybody wants to be in the music business, and the years that I've worked, I've gotten tapes and offers from everyone from politicians, to businessmen who wanna be in the entertainment business. - They started talking. Mike said you got Dr. Dre, and Suge said yeah, he a producer. Mike said, well, we need to meet. And Suge said well, I got a couple of cases. I can't get in to visit you. So Mike said no, I got this attorney. He's bad. He can get you in here. - David Kenner brought Suge Knight to see Michael at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Downtown, Los Angeles. They set down their basic business plan that they would start a company called Godfather Entertainment, and one division of it would be Death Row Records. - One day, I see these two people walk in a building who I'd never seen before, and one was David Kenner, and the other was Lydia Harris. - In the summer of 1991, Kenner started coming around. There was a lot of buzz about this company, a lot of expectations that it could be a successful company, and David was one of the people around at the time making a play to be Suge's partner and to take care of business for Suge, to handle business for Suge. - Couple days after Mrs. Harris and David Kenner came in, things actually changed drastically. Immediately, the studio gets carpeted, things start getting fixed. I'm starting to get presented with money to find apartments for the artists that didn't have any apartments, didn't have any money. I'm also given allowance for them. - I saw a few little upgrades in the studio. Some chairs, some speakers. - And I was also told we'll be getting collect calls and to accept them, and to find Suge where he was and connect them. - We were assigned by them to build an awareness for Godfather Entertainment, and to kick off their first vehicle, which is Death Row Records to the industry. - Norman Winter and his infinite wisdom said let's take the boys into Beverley Hills. Let's stick it in everybody's face. So, off to Chasen's. - [MC] Let me see you put your hands together and say, oh yeah! - [Crowd] Oh yeah! - [MC] Let me see somebody get Dre, Suge, DOC a round of applause. Death Row Records is gonna be the record company of the 2000s. - We was thinking about putting in melody tactics at the entrance. - Everyone gets served with subpoenas as an invitation. - "You are hereby ordered to appear before "the honorable Dr. Dre and the officers "of GF Entertainment, "as a guest of the court to witness the springing "of Death Row records." - Put your hands together. Come on, y'all, make some noise. - We invited virtually every major record company executive in Los Angeles and New York, and it was so big that we originally planned on spending around $20, $25,000. It turned out to be 35 or 50. - They had enough money at the time behind them and for somebody to come out of nowhere to have a party at Chasen's on Grammy night which is reserved generally for all the white people. It's also a place that would never be associated with rap music in anyway unless it was simply co-sponsored by a white group. - The mark we're going after, we're mainly for the people. I mean, for us the West Coast has a lot of talent around that guys, we don't have the opportunity, don't have the chance to prove theirself. So of course, GF Entertainment goes with the studio and the films, we giving all the youngsters an opportunity from all the neighborhoods. Basically, we haven't forgotten where we came from. - I personally interviewed all of the players that were there. - GF Entertainment is a multimedia company. We have Death Row Records. We have a movie production unit, concerts. We're gonna be doing pay-per-view concerts, and all kinds of exciting things. - In the beginning, they was giving Mike his props, and they was recognizing that there was another entity that helped this be one major powwow. - When it came to David Kenner, he toasted the man who made it all responsible, Harry-O. - The label started with Dr. Dre, who was gonna do his own thing, and with a lot of help from Suge Knight and Harry-O and a number of people, we got it all together. - And that's on tape, and the FBI confiscated that from me under very rude circumstances. - When Death Row was in the soul offices, we pretty much gave over to the one floor. There were a lot of young, folks hanging out, but it wasn't what it become. - Unfortunately, there was a lot of tension. An element showed up that my people were not accustomed to. Dre had invited these guys over to the studio. When Suge came, these guys were using the phone. So he told them, hey man, get off the phone. So, the guy said to Suge, hey man, we were invited up here by Dre. Dre told us that we could use this phone. An argument ensued. Suge went down to the car and got a gun. And hey, beat these guys up in the studio. He shot through the wall to scare them. The hole is in the wall over there. The cops came and dug the bullet out. - [Voiceover] George and Lynwood Stanley later sued Knight. He agreed on a $1,000,000 settlement, but only paid a third of it. - Deep Cover. - Deep Cover. - Deep Cover was a critical success. - It was the introduction of Dre as a solo artist. ("Deep Cover" by Dr. Dre) It was the introduction of Dre as a mentor to other artists. In this case, Snoop Doggy Dogg. - By Snoop blowing up on Deep Cover, I looked at that like we were all blowing up, 'cause I always knew we did music together and I always had confidence in our music that it would sell, and that it would sell worldwide. And after the way it blew up with Snoop, it pumped me up like, man, I can't wait 'til it's my turn, 'cause they really do love what we doing. - That single was so significant, because it shows these two different worlds that Dre was leaving, and where he's going to. - Dr. Dre wanted to make a statement that he was a solo artist, that he was a good artist on his own, and a good producer. The thing back then was, we gon' try to come up. That's all Dre used to talk about was coming up, coming up. And The Chronic was what was supposed to set it off. - What I'm doing right now is... I'll be putting out a solo album soon. - Everybody put their all into The Chronic album because we seen that, not only was this gonna build the record company that we want because this was the first album off the record company we want. This will build all of our careers. - When we vibe, it's straight whatever Dre want. It's Dre. Dre, whatever you want. You want this concept, Dre? You want this? You want this? It's all about Dre. It's all about Compton and Dre. Dre, Dre, Dre. Boom. - You had Snoop Dogg, who just brought a whole nother style to rap music. - He has a voice where he could rap over beats and just rip a beat to pieces. - A lot of that shit was on the spot, spontaneous. Right there. We just putting the weed together like this, breaking it down, put it in a zig-zag. Once we twist that shit up and blaze, if it's a crime, we gon keep it in this... On the low down, motherfucking throw it out and come with some new shit. - First of all, you had so many hungry, starving individuals that wanted to be superstars who put they talent together, and it came out to be a classic. - The camaraderie in them early days over there, man. All them cats used to show up to the studio... - They were poor as hell, but they still were a family. They still had fun. - [Dre] Yeah! Chronic, baby! - So, it wasn't like we had money to hang with our friends or anything like that, so we just hung together. And we created a masterpiece. - Check it out! - I think it was a lot of collaboration on The Chronic album as far as names like Daz, Kurupt, Snoop, Warren G, DOC, RBX and myself, Rage, Jewell. - We were all starvin'. All starvin'. Dre included. We'll be up there eating Popeye's chicken five days a week. - I gotta go warm the joint. We had weed, the best weed. That's why we made The Chronic because we had the chronic. - I mean, sometimes we was just in there drinking or elevating our minds to another level. Dre'll be like, working with the beats at the time and he'll come up with something, and depending on who was in the studio at that particular time. - It was people waiting all over the world for that album, for Dre's album to drop. - The Chronic was finished. We had originally thought we were gonna be able to distribute the record with Sony. - This would've been the first time in history that young guys would've actually had the opportunity to have a distribution deal, what they call a P&D deal, through a major and get all the money. - Sony refused to distribute The Chronic. - Sony, because of their fearfulness of some of the crazy things going on around Death Row and their wariness of the contractual status of Dr. Dre, didn't wanna get that deal done. - Part of their fears in dealing with rap bands is that some of these gangsta rappers might turn out to be real gangsters. Indeed, many of them are. Any number of these guys go to jail every year. It's like the first thing that, you know, they go platinum and then they go to jail. - Dick and I then negotiated a deal with BMG to put out the record. They heard the lyrics, and they said, we're not gonna put the record out. Everybody got afraid of putting out any kind of rap records with explicit lyrics that talked about killing cops and stuff. - It wasn't nobody out there with us. It was a time when we shopping a deal, we had an album done. - John McClane, Jr. came along. When he heard the record, he went crazy. He said, Griff, Griff, you gotta give me this. You gotta give me this record. - John said, I love the record, why don't you let me take it to Interscope? - An opportunity appeared for a young aggressive label to distribute Death Row, and two established industry people to deal with, Jimmy Iovine, who was a superstar producer of rock records, and Ted Fields who had been a movie producer and produced some hit music. They had some rather controversial acts of their own. In rock, Nine Inch Nails. They signed Tupac Shakur, the other hottest rapper in the business. - Interscope was out of business. They were getting ready to close the doors. Warners, Atlantic was dropping a deal and Ted Fields was tired of pouring his personal money in there. So, here comes Dick Griffey with The Chronic. - Dick and I went and met with Jimmy Iovine and we met with David Cohen, and we played them The Chronic and they said they were interested in making a deal. - So, these guys told me, said, look, Dick, we're gonna advance you $200,000. - Well, the mean time, what was going on is there was no more money. There was no cash flow. - Friday, no money. Saturday, no money. Sunday, no money. Monday, no money. Tuesday, they advanced $100,000 for which we had to sign as a loan. By Wednesday, Suge and Dre were up and Interscope. Jimmy Iovine got a hold of Dre. Said, see, Dre? They doing it to you again, Dre. These guys are taking advantage of you. - They then got in touch directly with Suge and said, you know, Griffey was here. He won't make us a deal, but you give us a record, we'll give you $1,000,000. The man, once again, had done the old divide and conquer. - There's really a lot of prejudice in the business, and people think it's so much black and white, but a lot of it is young and old. - Most of our young people don't really know what's available for them out there, so that's how they get taken advantage of. - Older guys, only thing they wanna do is sit you down and say, look, okay, Suge, you say you're a young entrepreneur, this what we gon' do. Give me all the stuff you got. Give me your tapes, give me your masters, give me your groups, and I'ma go over there and make you a deal. - Suge didn't know contracts. He didn't know manufacturing. He didn't know publishing. - But you know, my opinion was look, I ain't no punk. You don't gotta talk for us. We gon' go in there and speak for ourselves. Instead of getting a dollar, we want five. And our masters, and our own shit. - What they ended up with, is going over the Interscope and getting one of those regular slave deals. They took the kids away from the nest too soon. - Interscope clearly saw the money. And this is the record business. And I think they were smart enough to see that whoever this guy Suge Knight was, and knowing the track record of this producer, Dr. Dre, and you had the legal mind of Dave Kenner there, they've got all tools in place. Everything that we need is right here. We don't really have to do anything. All we have to do is fund these guys and do what we do, which is promote records, market records, and advertise records. - Jimmy Iovine had to go pay off Ruthless, Eazy, Jerry Heller, and have The Chronic distributed through Priority Records. - Eazy was getting on Dre's Chronic record like 50 cents a copy, maybe 25 cents. Then he had Dre Day. He talking shit about me, but every time Dre Day sell a record, I get 25 cent a copy. - After they signed the agreement, I think they realized they needed to leave, and they did. All of a sudden, they disappeared. - Suge cut off all ties with the people he was dealing with in the beginning, and we got a whole new office and a whole new crew. - That really became kind of the rupture in the relationship between Dick and Suge and DOC and Dre. The Chronic goes out and sells 5,000,000 copies, generates $50 million, and saved Interscope, made Interscope. - We invented something that wasn't out there. So it was fresh, and everybody wanted it. From the East Coast to the West Coast, period. - [Doug] You couldn't turn on MTV without seeing Dr. Dre. - First time I performed songs for The Chronic was with Dr. Dre, and we did like, a small, little concert in Compton. Man, motherfuckers were singing every word of the songs. It made me feel like, damn, this is my life right here. - To me, it wasn't like, okay, Dre is advocating everybody smoking weed. He wasn't saying that. He was saying, my album is dope. Do you understand what I'm saying? My album is dope. Buy it. - It was a good record. I know a lot of cats is pissed off behind those records right now, 'cause they say they haven't been paid, or they didn't get credit for it. I liked it. I mean, it was out... I was surprised by it. I was happy with it. In fact, I still play it from time to time. I don't like listening to his voice on this shit, but I still listen to it. - If you understand what was going on in the street at that time or even now, word of mouth is everything, and Death Row became really hip on the street. Every young, black entertainer wanted to be a part of it. So there was no problem in finding talent at all. There was an understanding at Death Row that they weren't getting at the major companies. - One of the things about these major labels, they'll never understand street music. They'll never understand stuff that starts right there in the neighborhoods. They'll never understand it. Never will, never will, never will. That's why you'll always have some young entrepreneurs who will come along, who really understand how to do that, and make a killing. - No matter how they is. If you see me out somewhere, I don't care who he is. I'm finna come over there, hear your hook, talk to you, how you doing? Whatever, you ain't gotta speak to me, I ain't gon' do no, let's do lunch. I ain't with all that (laughs). I be like wassup, I'm still from the ghetto. - It was a very, very good time for young kids looking for a break. There was an opportunity there. There were people that understood them, understood what they were about. Kids just come in and run auditions right off the street. - Basically the same thing Motown did. They took the mindset, the spirit, the dreams, the hopes and wishes and thoughts of the people of the time period, and they set it to music. - If anybody would really stop for a moment to analyse what really happened at Death Row, it's really a miracle. You have a company, a small company, run by a young, black entrepreneur, and he releases five or six LPs and all of them went, at least, I think, double platinum. Now, it's a known fact that our industry, if you're working for a major and your release 10 LPs, and you have three to four hit records out of the ten that you release, you're considered a genius. - I think the most important thing in my situation is that I wasn't coached. I think if a person's coached about the business, they're gonna continue to make the same mistakes the other entrepreneurs were making all along. - The appeal of Death Row and everybody wanting to join Death Row Records at the time, was the fact that Suge Knight was a black man with a lot of power, and he was a fearsome individual. That's the type of person you want on your team. - Suge Knight is an intimidating individual. When he enters the room, you notice him. You can't help it. I think that he would be considered a handsome man, huge man. - Suge's tremendous size intimidated people. When you got a 300-pound guy saying something, it means a lot more than if you had Mickey Rooney saying it. Suge was bright enough to use his size, much like Don King uses his hair. - The hype got so big that everybody started fearing it. - I have friends here at Sony and one of them calls and said, gee, you know, we really wanna get a track. You do me a favor and can you go talk to Suge? I say, I'll go talk to him. And so I went over to see Suge. I said Suge, what is it you doing? You got people out here that are afraid to talk to you. Suge became somewhat like a folk hero after a while. These stories that's developed a life of their own. You got Suge doing everything from throwing people off of a 30-storey building to putting rocks and beers in them, cement. - They put bad names on people and tried to drag their name through dirt. But now, as the individual, you got to do what you got to do to get paid. - He was a very brilliant businessman. Whatever his tactics might have been, whoever he had to step on to get there, his main objective was to just get there at any cost. - There's a genius which is a part of him, and you know what they say about geniuses. They aren't far from being insane. - Suge Knight pretty much blew his cover by appearing on the cover of magazines, because now you're no longer a figure behind the scenes. Now, you're a celebrity. You're making yourself a celebrity. - When Snoop's album comes out, this is the most anticipated rap album in history. - Doggystyle was, we're through with The Chronic. It's all about you, Snoop. You're the hottest thing coming out the West Coast in a long time, and Dre gon' produce it. And when Dre produce an album from top to bottom, you can't lose. - [Voiceover] Tell us what we should expect on the new album. - Gangsta shit. You know what I'm saying. Smooth gangsta shit. - We're here at Tower Records in Marina del Rey where this is really this hottest album on the shelves right now. - [Voiceover] Since the album was released a midnight last night at this store, they've already sold 130 CDs and about 100 cassettes. It could be the hottest album ever. Get it before it's gone. - Nobody had ever, in the modern era, had their very first album go number one. A triple platinum album is $30 million to the record label. It's more than $45 million on the retail level. Death Row became the core of Interscope which became the core of Warner Bros' music money-making machine. - After the Snoop album came out, it was all gravy, 'cause man, Death Row was flying high then. It was just so much money floating around Death Row for anything. I remember I used to keep thousands, I used to run through thousands of dollars a day. They're making $100 million a year. They can buy anything they want. They can buy anybody they want. That made it all very, very serious business. - Rappers didn't give gangsta rap its name. The music industry gave gangsta rap its name. They said, this music has cussing in it. They're calling women bitches, so that's gangsta rap because it comes from the gangs and the gangsters. - Gangsta rap isn't something that was just born and invented in a quote, unquote ghetto. It's something that you see on the American movies. The blowification of Al Capone and Lucky Luciano, and that's kind of glamorous in any American's eyes, I think. - It really puts the truth of society out in front of America, and America, not used to that, is obviously gonna be shocked about it. - Suppose they just started rapping about the 6:00 news? Would it be gangsta rap? - Gangsta rap is like the movies, too. Drama sells. - I take it for what it is. It's a record. It's a CD. It's a tape, you know. And I'm not gonna live my life by it, and other people shouldn't either. It's entertainment. - No black man should get on the front of a magazine with a 12-inch cigar in front of two Rolls Royces, wearing what could be considered gang colors in America. That sends a bad message. That's negative. - Publicity when it was negative played a role also, because it was part of this role that Suge Knight had chosen for the company. I mean, these kids were not gangsters, quote, real gangsters. Many people that were not, as a matter of fact, gang members like it has been portrayed in the press, there were people around that were. - When you got brothers that, you know, perpetrating gang violence or gang affiliation, making it cool, it's a problem. That could be a problem. - It wasn't just Death Row perpetuating the violence. I think it was the media. I mean, let's face it. The coverage was just awesome. All of a sudden, Death Row and gangsta rap was the reason that every youngster in America was going bad. - [Crowd] No gangsta rap! - Lyrics that promote rape, murder, racism, drug abuse, and violence... - Die. Die. Die, pig. Die. - Time Warner's Music Division promotes music that celebrates the rape, torture, and murder of women. - C. Delores Tucker is a political activist that embodies herself in matters of African-American decency questions. In the beginning, we was trying to protect America from the threat of gangsta rap. - You will see words that you can't even repeat in a locker room. - But by that point, the cat was out of the bag, and there's very little that she could've done. - Doggy style. Do it from the back. - She involved herself in Time Warner politics along with a odd political bedfellow for her, who was William Bennett. - The moral obtuseness of Time Warner, we do not understand why they don't get it. - These are right-wing conservatives. Both of them. They are would-be sensors. Both were attacking Time Warner along with Dole. - A line has been crossed. Not just of taste, but of human dignity and decency. - Now you've got a presidential candidate accusing Time Warner of debasing a nation, for handing Death Row product. - The mainstreaming of deviancy must come to an end. - Now, I think we do have problems with the social fabric of this country right now. I do have trouble believing that it is caused by song lyrics or movies. - Time Warner was also doing Ice T. They got T off the label, but they were stuck with Death Row and the numbers were huge. They didn't know what to do with it. They'd just put $120 million into it. They're getting all that money out and then some. They can't be seen by any of their artists to give into political pressure whatsoever. If you do that, they'd never get another act again, and no self-respecting manager would ever side with a label who they thought could be pressured for content. - We, African-American women particularly, are tired of being called hoes, bitches, and sluts by our children who are paid to do this by Time Warner. - She came out with an idea that she reportedly pitched to Fuchs that what if she started a label, a positive rap label, and got Suge to distribute Death Row product through her, with her as the watchdog of the lyrical content to make sure that the messages were positive. Michael Fuchs, reportedly desperate to try and figure out a solution to this, apparently listened to her. She got Fuchs to guarantee $80 million if she could pull this off. - Interscope was not about to let Death Row go without a fight. Suge Knight also protected those artists lyrically. Made sure that everyone was allowed to say whatever the hell they wanted to say. - Whatever happens, we're gonna stand up tall and be more successful. Only thing anybody doing is making us stronger and better. - No way he was gonna let C. Delores Tucker decide the lyrical content of a Snoop Doggy Dogg album. That wasn't gonna happen. But, they apparently thought it was. Michael Fuchs reportedly flew to Los Angeles in a Time Warner jet to Dionne Warwick's house where C. Delores Tucker sitting there waiting for Suge to come over to cut a deal that would make a tame Death Row Records. - What she really wanted was a record company or to have more involvement in that business. I mean, it is a very lucrative business. She had the wherewithal to see where this rap situation was going, how it had the nation really sort of unnerved. She was just trying to parlay it into something for herself or she had been promised it would be something for herself. - Never. Never have I discussed $80 million with them about any kind of business deal. - The story goes that they waited five hours, Michael Fuchs, C. Delores Tucker, at Dionne Warwick's house that Suge never showed up. Suge went right back to Interscope and said, do you know what these guys just tried to pull? So Interscope then promptly sued Time Warner, and promptly sued C. Delores Tucker for interfering with their contractual relationship. - [Voiceover] Time Warner has decided to get out of the gangsta rap business by selling its 50% share of Interscope Records back to that company. - Made the right decision, the morally responsible decision, we think, and we believe that either action, divesting themselves of Interscope at some financial loss, they have set a standard for the entire entertainment industry. - I commend them for it. I think they're gonna be good corporate citizens. - Death Row Records was at the center of controversies and if the Republicans would've had their way, would have brought down a president. That's how big the controversy got. - The origins of Death Row, starting with David Kenner, Michael Harris, and Suge Knight, didn't seem out of the ordinary until all the information started unfolding, because David Kenner, nobody knew who he was. - David Kenner became the principal business attorney for the label, as well as the criminal attorney for many people at the label. - Los Angeles police announced that 21-year-old Calvin Broadus, better known as rap star Snoop Doggy Dogg had turned himself in to police on Friday, along with two other young, black men all accompanied by an attorney, in connection with the murder on August 25th of a man named Phillip Woldermariam in what police believe was a gang-related shooting. - It never should have gone to trial. The alleged victim in this case had a gun, he was reaching to his waistband to pull that gun out at the time, Snoop's bodyguard fired the shot. And that's what we said from the beginning. The testimony makes it clear. This is a case of self defense. - The D.A., he was a pain in the ass. He just tried to do everything in the world to make me seem like the most negative gang-bangingest, criminal-minded motherfucker he could just imagine. He tried to paint a picture of me that just wasn't happening. It was crazy knowing that he was, that's what his job was, to do was to get me locked up for life. I just wanna say fuck you, bitch. - Dave Kenner was the guy who legally made Suge secure. One of the benefits Suge Knight gave to people to join Death Row was to say that I have a legal team, people who have a lot of experience in the criminal arena that can help you. Whereas in the past, coming from a black community, you go into a white justice system where all the cards are stacked against you. Here, for the first time in most of their lives, they were given a lawyer who was very capable, and an investigator on top of it. And the results spoke for themselves most of the time. They got to see instances where they were acquitted in cases in which normally, they would have been convicted. In the rap industry, the problems happen at one or two in the morning, so it's not a nine to five job. David was the rare lawyer who would be available to clients at that hour. - Of the $70 or $80 million that Interscope paid them between 1995 and 1997, about $13 million of that went to the law office of David Kenner or to David Kenner. Certainly, this company was his bread and butter for some time. - What's your name again? - David Kenner, K-E-N-N-E-R. - I was quite surprised because you expect a music business attorney, but he wasn't. He was a criminal attorney. - He had entertain attorney qualitites. He's flamboyant. He's sharp. And he's kinda mafia-ish. His whole persona. - After a while, David might have got so caught up in his lifestyle that he might become somewhat confused, because the thing is that, David really was supposed to be working on getting Mike out. - David was handling Michael's appeal. David was involved very much in Lydia's life. He was friends with Lydia. This was a person who was very trustworthy to him. - When I talk, man, Mike is making a ton of money, and then, you see Dave Kenner there. So, you say if Dave is there, then Mike is there. And then the story starts lashing, and then you know that they got a war going on. - It was rumors that Suge was over there trying to get a deal at Interscope, but when he would go down to visit Mike, him and Kenner would say it wasn't true, but Mike said hey, what's this here in the newspaper? And Suge would say, oh, you know how the newspaper print up articles. So, Mike said, well, they not just gon' print up anything, so he start asking David, what's going on? Then David came and said Suge did this behind my back. - And that started to cause Michael concern about what exactly was going on. He started to get word that Suge was telling people, oh, Michael Harris is nobody. He's not my partner. And the word on the street was, Michael Harris was really pissed off with Suge. It's on. - He wanted to get all the credit, which Mike don't trip to credit. The world thinks that Suge did this on his own. - Mike's in jail, but he's got a wife. He's got a kid. He's got family out here. He's got people he's taking care of. So, you know, his reaction, if he stunned, that he's kinda mad about it. How you gon' punk me? - The phone was never blocked because it always had cats calling from the pen. Harry-O wasn't the only one. But after a while, I even remember, and I think it was because of Harry that they then blocked the phone where it couldn't take no more calls. - David Kenner started off to play these guys against each other. Once the riff between Suge and Mike happened, Dave Kenner had to pledge allegiance one way or the other. - Throughout this time, even if Suge was denying his partnership with Michael, denying that Michael had any role in the company, David would be going up to visit Michael and saying, oh no, everything's okay. There's no problem. Everything's fine. We're gonna get this taken care of. - It reminds me of the Brutus and Caesar. At some point, Michael gets a hold of the incorporation paperwork of Death Row Records, and realizes that Suge and David Kenner had set up a different company of Death Row Records that was independent of this GF Entertainment Michael had a hand in, and I think Michael began to suspect that things were not so kosher with their partnership. - He the one told Dave, hey, look at this man, that guy Suge, I like him. Go talk to him. Okay, a record company? Okay, I give you this amount of money. You tell him to do this, okay? Then him and Suge talk, and Suge going to visit him. Suge, check this out. Put it down like this, man. Put it down like that. Dave, you do this part. Keep him out of jail. You make sure keep him out of jail. That's how Suge got all the probation stuff. Dave fighting like he crazy to keep him out of jail, because Mike telling him to. Keep him out of jail. But guess what? Soon the money come in. Who? Harry-O? They turned into Scooby Doo in him. Who? Who's that? - Mike said, where's the money? And they said, it's gonna be 60 to 90 days before we see a warranty check. So those 60 and 90 days turn into a year. I went over and met with Dave at Cohorn and he said, well, you know, what if they don't pay you? And I told him, I'm not threatening you, but I'ma go on national TV and tell what really happened. - Everybody knew Harry-O wasn't no joke. Everybody knew Harry-O had chips. All you gotta do is be no joke and have chips, and you can get somebody handled. - [Lydia] As for Michael, typed up a letter. - Michael put his concerns on paper in the form of a lawsuit that could have been filed, that was never filed, laying out his grievances as to how he had been a founding partner in Death Row Records and had been denied his fair share of the proceeds. That lawsuit was shown to Interscope, and Interscope did a fairly generous settlement to make it go away before they ever got filed. - That next day, I got a call. They told me that Mike was in a wheelchair. His mouth was twisted. He couldn't even walk. He couldn't even use his hands. He couldn't do nothing. I said, what happened? And that's when the doctor said he had Guillain-Barré. And I asked Mike. I said, well that, can I give you anything? - I started thinking, least to myself that Suge was getting hisself caught up into too many situations that were unhealthy. He had created an image that was working for him, and sometimes image merged with reality, I'm not sure that as time went on, that Suge didn't draw the line between when it was the image and when it was reality. - Suge wasn't a gangster. Suge came from a family. His mother and father were still together. He was a college football player. - I feel I got a whole, whole lot of street credibility and street smarts, and at the same time, I graduated from college. I hit the books, and I put both of them together. - He ran that company like it was his gang. That's his family. He might not love us, but he made us think he did. - A lot of what followed, in part, had to do with trying to establish Death Row as a label with the most street credibility and we're really doing gangsta rap and we're keeping it real. We're keeping it legitimate. And so when you guys get out the joint, you can come get a job with me. That sorta thing. - I ain't never had a job before in my life until I started working for Suge. In and out of jail, you know what I'm saying. Did a little bit of everything. - Yeah, a lot of them cats that was up there were fresh out the penitentiary with their penitentiary mentality. It was like working at a prison with no guns, no knives, no nothing. You just had to be in there on your own and handle it. How many companies do you know can have some crips and bloods up there? Crips and blods. At first, I was totally with Death Row's concept, because it was about time we had a brother out there that wasn't taking no shit from these companies that wasn't paying their money. So I was totally with it. It was when the nonsense got too out of hand. - We had a system of that kind of thing, sorta like a demerit system for artists and so on, and for some of the office workers. - Say something wrong, you get a smack. If you come late, you get smacked. You do this, you get smacked. That sounds to me, to me, it was like pimps and hoes. - I just knew how after a while, Suge was unapproachable. You couldn't really talk to him no more. I just, I just knew it. There was no more talking to this guy. This guy is the fucking man. That company was by no ways, forms, or fashion Hollywood. You know how white folks like to do. They like to scream at each other, I'm gonna get my lawyer on you! But the new brothers wasn't doing it like that. They was coming through doors, coming through windows, and the whole nine on people. - You know, these rappers are from the street. They're not used to nothing else. So, you have to deal with them in the street mentality. - I heard somebody once describe them as all thinking they were in a Godfather movie. - Suge was famous for applying the old mafia tactics. He would instill fear in everybody. That guy just walks in, he walks into a room, he has no idea we're in the middle of a meeting. He wants a record deal. He walks in and he says he know how to rap. Suge says okay, rap. If we don't like what you do, we're gonna kick your ass. He said maybe three words and they just lit his ass up. - I've seen people get beat up. I've seen people get that door locked on them. The infamous door lockings. They take you in a room and touch you up and down. - I wasn't the only lady that got beat up. I was the only lady beat up and he held down. Suge grabbed me by my feet and everything went haywire. This girl cold-cocked me. Loosened up my teeth and I had two black eyes. David Kenner stood up and watched. Somebody else video-taped it, and I kicked Suge in his nuts and I got the hell up outta there. I have not laid eyes on Suge since that day. He won't lay eyes on me 'til he see this. - All that drama that people knew that was happening right there at Death Row on that 12th floor. This is at the building right down here at the UCLA on Willshire. It never leaked over to the Interscope's side. You see the Interscope. Interscope looks nice, woody thing say Interscope Records. They'd get in at a reception. Death Row is just a door. It was just a mahogany colored door with a camera. - DOC and RBX both had problems with Suge. They seen what type of person he was on the inside. Not to say nothing bad or not to say nothing good about him, but they seen the type of person he was. And through the grace of God and good attorneys, they were able to leave. Everybody else was forced in a chokehold after that. - Tupac Shakur was not before his time, but one of a kind of his time and era. He was a movie star, but for him to be doing street stuff gave him sort of a Marlon Brando edge. The outlaw, who was living life in some romantic or just Hemingway world where you lived out your art. - He had that almost uncontrollable, defiant attitude. - I got a big mouth. Can't help it. I talk from my heart. I'm real. Whatever comes, comes. But my controversy problem. And it's not my fault. I'm trying to find my way in the world. I'm trying to be somebody instead of just making money off everybody. - Tupac's gift was the ability to take somebody else's pain and story and translate it. - We as rappers bought that violence. We bought the violence that we see on the street and put it in our records. Put it in our records for years. And after three, four years, people finally starting to see it because all the statistics that's going on in the streets. If we stop talking about it, then they wouldn't take statistics. And when they stop taking statistics, then we be killing each other in the street and these white people wouldn't care no more. - He would definitely give you something to think about. - I know some of y'all white folks and some of y'all black folks don't appreciate what we talking bout, but this is the only way we got to make money. And if you don't let me make my money on the streets, I guarantee, I will make my money on the streets. - A lot of people say the same things or have said the same things as Pac. But Tupac made it believable. - At first, I always thought he was this crazy, arrogant little idiot, but I didn't really know how deep he was. - We have to be honest about the tools that we use to survive, and why is a black life any more recoupable than a white life? We know that they don't put the same security in the ghetto that they do in the white neighborhoods. - What I saw in Tupac was someone who had a desire to be successful, and he only had two or three avenues. One was rapping, one was acting, and the other was going into the movement that his family came out of. - [Ton] His mother was a Black Panther. All of the anger, frustration, and everything that she was dealing with and what was going on with her, at that time in her life, was feeding right into him. When Tupac was a kid, for punishment, she would make him read the New York Times cover to cover. And at the end of the day, he would be quizzed on everything he read out of the paper. Tupac, well aware of what his mother had gone through, brought that into the 90s because nothing had changed in the 60s to the 90s as far as he saw with his race of people. - I don't know how to be responsible for what every black male did. I don't know. Yes, I am gonna say that I'm a thug. That's because I came from the gutter, and I'm still here. I'm not saying I'm a thug 'cause I wanna rob you or rape people and thing. I'm a businessman. I mean, you know I'm a businessman because you find me at my place in some business. - Tupac was a star at Interscope, and Interscope had their hands full with him. He was in jail and in trouble. - He just had got beat up by the police. He had a lawsuit going at them that he won, and he was getting just harassed for anything. I mean, they just start throwing him on a nose as the bad guy of rap when he really wasn't that person. - I appreciate the present you have given me, for giving me a fair trail and a fair shot a justice. I thank you from the bottom of my heart for just destroying everything I worked for for the past 22 years. And a Happy New Year to you too. - Tupac was in the news everyday. I mean, you can't buy that kind of publicity. It's unfortunate the kinds of media coverage that they got, but it added to sales. - People didn't know Pac had like 15 cases in different states in America. We would go do a show, Pac would go straight to court soon as we get off the airplane. - Don't block my way and don't hit my lawyer. - Great artists are almost always out of step with what's going on in society because they see the world differently and they act differently. - The last situation he got into, Interscope kinda like, left him for dead. They wasn't really fucking with Pac like that. - [Voiceover] Shakur and another man were accused of sexually assaulting and sodomizing a 21-year-old woman in their hotel room last year. - It's not a crime for me to be with any girl I wanna be with. It's the crime for that girl to turn that into a rape charge. It was her who sodomized me. It wasn't me who went down in a dance club and ate her out. It was her at a dance club who had oral sex with me. She should be charged. Not me. - Last night, just after midnight, At 723 7th Avenue, that's between 48th and 49th Street, our rap star Tupac Shakur and three members of his group were robbed and shot. - The word on the streets is that it was a warning to Tupac. Who's it coming from? - [Voiceover] In a bizarre twist of events, rap singer Tupac Shakur checked himself out of Bellevue Hospital late Wednesday night after the 23-year-old was shot five times early that same morning in side the lobby of a Times Square recoding studio. - [Voiceover] Shakur had appeared in court today but had little to say about being shot. - [Voiceover] After three days of deliberations, the jury has finally decided the fate of rapper Tupac Shakur: guilty on three counts of sexual abuse. He now faces one and a half to four and a half years in prison. - The main evidence for the incarceration of Mr. Shakur was from City Hall. Mr. Giuliani himself. - Being 23, being black, and last name being Shakur in America, he never had a chance. - Tupac was in jail, and he wanted out of jail, and he wanted out of jail badly. No one, including Interscope, was putting up any bail money to get him out. And his bill was set at $1,400,000. - A lot of people on the East Coast, a lot of people in New York City dissed him hard, man. They dissed him on the radio. No one went to go visit him except for a few people. - And he wanted to be number one again. So where else do you go but to where the other number one people are? Death Row Records had been trying to get Tupac for some time. - If you got Suge Knight dangling in front of you freedom, freedom, money, power, respect, and can get you out of jail, obviously you're gonna go for it. You got a scared young man, first time behind bars, he's supposed to be back there for four years. - Pac promised him in return. You get me outta here, I'll put Death Row on the map. My first CD'll sell 6,000,000 copies. - And I don't think it's a coincidence that Suge wanted him on Death Row Records so badly, because even though Snoop was a huge star, he didn't have what Tupac had. That kind of icon presence like a James Dean, or Elvis. - Now, I heard that he had Pac sign a contract on toilet paper (laughs). I don't know how true it is, but I know when Pac came back, he was ready. - Tupac got out September of '95. He went to Death Row Records the day he got off the plane, and they laid down their first track for All Eyez On Me in 15 minutes. - This albums is more celebratory of life. Upbeat, energetic, fun, I think, but it's also harsher, in terms of the language because I didn't, I've been in jail for 11 1/2 months. - Tupac brought the feeling of I was nothin', now I'm somethin', and I wanted everybody else to be something too. If I could do it, you can do it. - He stirred up the whole group there. He got them all going, and all working. He made sure that every artist at Death Row had some part of this double CD. It was his way of saying, look, I'm part of the family, and I want you on my album, which he did not have to do. - I remember doing a session with him and it seemed like he was just running around having fun, you know, having a good time. But the man was done. We though that he didn't even write them. We thought he came with his lyrics already, but no, he wrote them that day. And that's how sharp he was, man. - You had people around the studio saying, man, we gotta get like Pac. Pac just go in there and kick 'em in, kick 'em out. Kick 'em in, kick 'em out. And that's all they'd talk about. And exactly what they're doing. - He made the level of competition, which is a good thing. He brought that level up. Any of the artists will tell you that what Tupac put into them was this business of work ethic, where you can do more if you just work at it. When Tupac came, it's like, Suge wasn't worried about nobody else. Not Snoop, nobody at the time. Nobody. - By the time that Tupac got out of jail, Sean Puffy Combs was about to become I would say the East Coast version of Suge Knight with Bad Boy Records. His first big artist was the Notorious B.I.G. - This bullshit about the East Coast and the West Coast started when we went out to New York to do the Source Awards, and Mr. Knight went on stage and he's in New York City, and we all know Puff is from New York City. - Any artist out there wanna be an artist and wanna stay at star, won't have to worry about an executive producer trying to be all in the videos, all on the records, dancing, come to Death Row. (crowd booing) - I mean, the whole crowd started booing and then I thought to myself like, why would you do that? - The East Coast don't love Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg? (crowd cheering) The East Coast ain't got no love for Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg? And Death Row? Y'all don't love us? Y'all don't love us? Well, let me be known then! We know y'all East Coast. We know where we at. (crowd booing) East Coast (mic tunes out). - I'm the executive producer that that comment was made about a little bit earlier. But check this out, contrary to what other people may feel, I would like to say that I'm very proud of Dr. Dre of Death Row and Suge Knight for their accomplishments. And all this East and West thing need to stop. - It was so personal. Puffy was a good friend of mine. - There's enough room in this business for two young black males who are entrepreneurs to exist, I mean. Can you imagine if Al Bell and Berry Gordy were fighting or if the Temptations had beef with the Four Tops? I mean, it sounds fucking retarded when you think about it. The Four Tops got beef with the Temptations. Marvin Gaye and Smokey Robinson were fighting at the Grammy Awards last night. I mean, think about it for a second. - A lot of people in the West Coast felt that we have always had love for the East Coast. They come here and break their records. They come here and play at the clubs. They come do in-stores. We do the whole nine with them East Coast cats. And we go out there, and we don't get that same love. - I remember New York DJs at parties refusing to play West Coast records. They country, they're bammers, they wear jheri curls, they can't rhyme. They're wack. It's not danceable. - It was the media that blew it up. You're seeing certain things that somebody said highlighted in magazines about the West Coast and vice versa and it just, it just boiled over from there. - All these people talking about a East Coast/West Coast war, they like Judas was to Jesus. They only here to cause confusion. - It made rap music look bad. It made rap music look like it's just another part of the dope gang. - Controversy is what Death Row started living off of, instead of talent. - If this was chess, we'd be yelling checkmate three motherfucking years ago, 'cause we been beat these motherfuckers. - Then the disrespect just started getting worse and worse between the West Coast and the East Coast. - Overthrow the government y'all got right now which is Bad Boy and Nas and all that bullshit, and we will bring a new government here that will feed every person in New York. - And then you had Tupac and Big situation, flaming in even more. - [Tupac] I possess his soul. Him and Puffy. They know that I was the truest nigga involved with Biggie's success. I was the biggest help. I was the truest. I don't write his rhyme, but you know how much you borrowed from me. He know how I used to stop my shows and let him touch the shelf. Let him blow up and do his whole show in the middle of my show. How I used to buy him shit and give him shit, and never asked for it back. How I used to share. How I used to share my experiences in the game and my lessons and my rules and my knowledge on the game with him. He owe me more. He owe me more than to turn his head and act like he didn't know niggas was about to blow my fucking head off. He knew. But for me to know, three weeks ago this happened, and then three weeks later, your album's coming out and you are fucking don in your album. But you don't know how shot me in your fucking hometown? This nigga is from your neighborhood and I gotta find out by myself and I don't even call myself a don, just a capo from the Westside. And I'm on the Eastside in jail and I know who touched me and I know everything that happened. - Tupac was wrong in blaming whoever the individual figures were who actually had something to do with it in New York, and making it into this whole New York City thing, then this East Coast/West Coast thing. And I think he definitely had someone in his ear, probably Suge, exacerbating it. It sells records. It continues to get media attention, which sells more records. - Tupac had claimed to have gone out with Biggie's wife, Faith Evans. This was a great humiliation reportedly for Biggie. It was all over. - We were in Manhattan shooting a video. Biggie Smalls had gotten on the radio station and Biggie said that I cannot believe that New York is allowing Tupac and the Dogg Pound to shoot a video in our city right in the heart of Times Square. The words out of Biggie's mouth was, "Tupac and the Dogg Pound," and it wasn't. It was Snoop and the Dogg Pound. Tupac was not with us. Snoop, at the time, was having his hair braided. All of the artists was in the trailer, then all of a sudden, gunfire. Someone shot into the trailer. They weren't shooting in there to say get out. They were shooting in there to kill someone. - There was a shift in Tupac Shakur's lyrical content. He at first was more political, then at some point, he became more street. It was West Coast versus East Coast. The person at Riker's Island was very reflective and he's gonna change his life and everything. This new person was like, fuck New York, fuck the East Coast. Suge is the man. He takes care of me. He's flashing money in front of the MTV cameras. It was like, wow, his jet going high. - One of the songs was a song called Hit 'Em Up. It talked about killing the Bad Boy camp. Different artists. It was a lot of threats. I go, Pac, did you hear what you said? He was like, yeah, nigga, I wrote it. Okay, um. We're gonna need some more security and you need to start wearing a vest. - Any time you have this synergy between two or more people and they make things happen, when you start breaking that up, things are never the same again. - When you think about Dr. Dre, here's a cat who's always had some sort of big brother or father figure around him. Earlier on, it was Alonzo Williams. Then it was Eazy-E, Jerry Heller. Then it becomes Suge Knight. And so, Dre was one of those cats who always needed guidance from someone else because Dre is really an artistic person. He's an artist. He's a true artist. - Seem like after a while, somebody was pulling his strings. Like, Dre had to answer to somebody. - [Voiceover] Who do you think that was? - We all know who that was. - The King, i.e. Suge Knight felt the need to have the court around him, and I don't think Dre felt comfortable with that. - I've got all these people around me. How many of them do I really need? - Tupac and Dr. Dre was fine from the beginning. Everything was great. I mean, you didn't see any problems. From the time that I worked there in '95 up until early '96, Dr. Dre had been in the studio twice. Pac took offense to that. - He wasn't producing shit. Other niggas was producing the beats I put on my album. Other niggas was doing the beats, and Dre was getting the credit. - Daz and all the other little producers and Assassin, all the ones we have, they did the tracks. Dre wasn't doing the tracks and Dre didn't write the lyrics. - Suge basically took on the role for Tupac that he had taken on for Dre. And I don't think it's a coincidence at a certain point, Tupac started becoming a mouthpiece for Suge and started dissing Dre. - He is a dope producer, but he ain't worked in years. I'm out here in the street, you know what I mean, whooping niggas' ass, starting wars and shit, putting it down, dropping albums, doing my shit, and this nigga taking three years to do one song. - I'm seeing the change like right after we finished Murder Was the Case and we moved into Can Am Studios, start working on the Dogg Food album. I just seen that he wasn't as inspired and it was like, it was too many thugs and niggas up there that didn't have nothing to do with nothing. - It was mostly just the way the studio was. And that's where I have to spend most of my time. - It was not a work atmosphere no more. It became fun and games and the success had kicked in, and we were stars. And motherfuckers just loved being around us, and bringing bullshit around us. And Dre wasn't for that. - I just didn't like some of the things that were going on. There was nothing being done to stop it. - Dre and I used to work in an environment where he can create, and everybody's on a creative atmosphere and it's not about what's going on in the hood, how many niggas you shot, and how much shit you done did. He don't want that. - Suge took over the company. It was no mystery to nobody. I don't think Dre wanted to be a yes man for somebody, so he wanted his own situation again. So he bailed out. - He says wait, I want out of this world. I want to form Aftermath, where I'm not part of Death Row anymore. I wanna be beyond that. I wanna be with my family. I wanna live. - When Dr. Dre left Death Row Records, that was the biggest shock to me. 'Cause I was real confused at how you start a label and you leave the label. I always figured if you had a problem with somebody on your label, you make them leave the label and you go on with what you're doing. I guess that was the way of learning it wasn't all his label. - Dre's departure wasn't a loss for me. If you have a multi-million dollar company maybe worth a billion dollars or so, and you own it 100% and don't have a partner, then you don't have to give him nothing but his walking papers. That's great. - Dre made Death Row Records. You know what I'm saying? And this is absurd that he's gone from one situation to another situation where he feels like he's being under-compensated. - To give up 50% of your label and move on elsewhere from a dangerous situation which Death Row Records was becoming and we now find out that it is, was a smart move for him. (record scratches) - September 7th, we were just leaving the fight. Tupac, Mike Tyson, friends, we're at the fight. And we go backstage to leave the building. Immediately after coming from backstage, one of Suge's homeboys came up and whispered into Tupac's ear. Pac took off running. There was a gentleman standing with a MGM security guard by a pillar as Tupac was approaching him. Now when I think about it, the guy was standing there waiting. Then Pac ran up on him, and the fight broke out. Orlando Anderson and a couple of Suge's homeboys had gotten into a fight at the Lakewood Mall in California back in April of '96 over a Death Row chain because there was a bounty on the Death Row chains. The same person that had gotten into altercation with Orlando Anderson in the mall whispered into Tupac's ear and it caused this fight. They were beating Orlando Anderson up on the ground. Tupac, Suge, and the rest of the entourage, they were pretty much bragging about what had happened. We get back to the Luxor Hotel. We go up to Tupac's room. He changed clothes, come back downstairs. We're all just standing around. All the women are coming out, everybody's ready to go over to 662, the after party. So Tupac turns to me and says, no, don't ride with us. He hands me the keys and says, you go drive your little homies because we're going to the club, gonna be partying and you're gonna drive us. So I said okay. Pac and Suge get into the BMW. We get back onto the Las Vegas strip. Suge's the lead car. I'm the car right behind him, and then, there's just cars all behind us. So we turn right off of Las Vegas Boulevard onto Flamingo to go down to 662. As we approach the next stoplight, which is Koval on Flamingo, there is a car coming down the open lane that is next to myself and the BMW. As the car's approaching, I turn and I look to my right, and I see the car. It's a white Cadillac. It kinda had moved over, and I would say closer to the BMW probably about that close and an arm just comes out and just starts firing. - I heard the shots being fired. Pac stood up to try to get into the backseat to get out the way of the shots. That's how he got shot in his hip, which hit one of the bones and travelled and hit his lung. I grabbed him and said get down, and covered him. When I pulled him down, that's when I got shot in my head. I said, you hit? He said I'm hit. So I'm driving like a madman to a hospital and the first thing he said laughingly, jokingly, loudly, is I need a hospital? You the one shot in the head. (sirens wailing) - Coming up next on the 10:00 news. His lyrics, his life reflected a gangsta lifestyle. Tonight, Bay Area rapper Tupac Shakur is dead of gunshot wounds. - All over the media, all over the news, all over the radio. - [Voiceover] Hundreds line the streets outside the Nation of Islam school to pay their respects to the slain rapper. - The first things I started hearing were rumors that Suge had had Tupac shot because Tupac was thinking of leaving the industry, and I started to laugh when I heard that. I said, you know, the problem with this is why would someone like Suge have the shooter shoot across the car so that the bullets would hit him? - There are so many different layers to the story and it's so tragic. Tupac Shakur is one of those kids who was really one of the great creative forces of our agents. He wasn't just a rapper. He was a kid who was really insightful. - He had said I didn't wanna go to Vegas anyway. He almost didn't even come. That day was gonna happen. It was the destiny of his life. He had the thought of not going, but he went because destiny was to die that next day. - And it's just a shame that another brother gets lost as a victim of his music. - If you have any street sense knowledge about yourself, you knew that company was gon' come crashing down feds first. - People let the fame go to their heads and their egos took over, and the next thing you know it wasn't nowhere to go but down. - Coming up, will the founder of one of rap music's most successful record labels be doing time for a probation violation? Last year, he pled no contest at two counts of assault, standing from a 1992 attack on two aspiring rappers in a Hollywood recording studio and this is a man who has eight different convictions. - And Your Honor, I ask you, how many bites at the probation apple does this defendant get? - I think it is very clear that Mr. Knight delivers a kick with his right foot. - That man made a choice to ignore his conscience. And it's only him that can reconcile that and can change it. We can't. We can just move on, give our contribution to the music industry, and hope that nothing like this ever happens again. - He was an active participant in this assault, and I do find a violation of probation. I also keep in mind, I think the way he left the scene evidenced a consciousness of guilt. I think he had been involved in assault, and the way he left the scene causes me to believe that he knew exactly what it was he was doing, what he was involved in. Your prior record indicates one of violence. You are a danger to the community. Your prior performance on probation was not satisfactory. You committed other crimes while you were on probation. You are not a suitable candidate for probation, in other words, and therefore, probation is denied. - I don't think anybody here has any question that if we were dealing with somebody other than Mr. Knight, what we saw in that video tape, first of all, would not be sufficient to constitute a probation violation, and secondly and most importantly, even if somebody thought it was, it's certainly not the kind of violation and the kind of activity that warrants a nine-year sentence. - How can Suge be in jail? How can one of the most powerful people in the record business, not black people, one of the most powerful people in the record business be in jail for something as silly as stopping a fight or even kicking somebody? - In my opinion, this is a miscarriage of justice. - You got this lawyer, this attorney, this guy who's pretty brilliant, so you know that this isn't a regular attorney. He's got some pull somewhere because he's got somebody from the DA's office involved in this thing, and you're saying to yourself, if all these people were involved, all these powerful people, what kind of situation did he set Suge up in? I mean, Dave Kenner was a big man in our business, on all levels, and you have to ask yourself, did the money get to him? Did the power get to him? You gotta ask yourself, was Suge thinking about this? Is he sitting in jail saying, is this guy really on my side? - Suge Knight was and is Death Row, and for me, without Suge Knight, there is so Death Row. - If Suge has grasped all that has happened to him, I think that he can come out and again, start up Death Row Records and start a record company that would be more viable than ever. - They will be legends no matter what happens, but if that had continued to go on, no telling what kind of influence they may have had on the inner city youth in America. When you have guys that have the ears of not only black America, but white America also, you can call some shots. Anybody can sell 4,000,000 records? 5,000,000 records? Anybody can sell out concerts around the world? Whatever they put their name and faces on will sell. Whatever they endorse, will be backed up 100%. - The Death Row Records story told the tale of three major record labels, almost brought one of them down, rattled another to its core, and set the framework for a whole new way of doing business in the music business. This was a story that wasn't just about a bunch of guys from Compton, it was a story that affected the whole music business and ultimately, the business world. - It's about empowerment. It's about greed. It's about ego. It's about sex. It's about violence. It's about fame. It's about failure. I mean, you don't get any more American than that. - The legacy that Death Row Records has left is both positive and negative. I think the positive legacy was that if you have talent, if you're prepared to work, you can create a business and it can be successful. People always say, remember how Suge started his company from nothing? We can do that. We're gonna hear this music forever. It's gonna forever mark an era in American culture and American history. - Now, the sad part about this whole thing is that Jimmy Iovine and Ted Fields sold Interscope for $400 million. I still have the articles. Wall Street Journal. It says, "Warners "Ups Its Stake in Rap Music." So what they were buying was Death Row. They paid $400 million for it. So Jimmy Iovine and Ted Fields got $400 million. Tupac's dead, and Suge's in jail. - Who's in jail? Mike Harris, Suge Knight. Where's the money? Who controls the money? (laughing) What happened to the power that all these black folks controlled? - Death Row is the named party in scores of lawsuits over its financial management and mismanagement with the federal investigation. They're looking into Suge's dealing in Las Vegas. They're looking into his dealings with Michael Harris. - Michael has an attempted murder charge over his head and a drug case over his head. If the government offered Michael an opportunity to get out of jail to testify against David Kenner or Suge Knight or Andre Young or someone else, there's a good chance that Michael could take it. - Suge, I would imagine, in the minds of white corporate American record business had to be stopped. He had to be stopped. - When we start taking the money that we make in the streets, however we do it, if it's hustling bottles, selling bottle tops, selling a bag of weed on the corner, however we do it, when we do it, and we start realizing, you know what, let me find something legal to do, that's when it becomes a problem. They don't want us legal. They rather we, 'cause they feel like, you selling dope, you ain't gon' never really get rich, unless you the man sitting next to the goddamn man. It'll be hard to dig up and find who started what with what kind of legal money, but they wouldn't wanna do that. If they were to take Death Row right now from Suge Knight, what about Atlantic Group? What about Interscope Records? They made more money than Death Row did off of Death Row. If Death Row's founded by drug money and Death Row made money, Interscope made money, Atlantic Group made money, you take everybody record company. You don't take just the black man's. (hip-hop music)
