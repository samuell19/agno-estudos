Come on, Littles. Let's put your coat on. It's cold out there. Let's cover up your little ears. OK, baby, let's go. To me, she is Little. That's the nickname that I call her. Come on, Little. There you go, baby. Off we go. I love it. I would never change it. Never. Just the word little connotes something that's not scary. It connotes a puppy, or a baby, or, you know, a tiny lap dog. So for Little, I think it has demystified some of the pit bull mystique of the tenacious dog that latches on to something and never lets go. Stay, Littles. Her body has scars all over it. Most people don't see that though, especially if she has on one of her coats. They just think she's an old little dog. And, for a lot of people, that's as far as I want to take it. You know, there are a lot of people that I wouldn't tell about her history because they might see her and they would have no idea. Sometimes I just don't want her to have that negative attention. I don't know how she survived or why she survived, but she did. CROWD: NFL, sack Vick. NFL, sack Vick. NFL, sack Vick. MALE REPORTER (VOICEOVER): NFL star Michael Vick has agreed to plead guilty to federal dog fighter charges and a deal that could spell the end of his NFL career. I take full responsibility for my actions. Dog fighting is a terrible thing and I didn't reject it. MALE REPORTER (VOICEOVER): Investigators say some of the losing dogs died in the pit, or were later put to death by drowning, hanging, or electrocution. In several searches of Vick's property, authorities have recovered more than 50 pit bulls. They've also discovered the graves of 7 pit bulls. FEMALE REPORTER (VOICEOVER): Officers found treadmills, whips, chains, injectable drugs, one of the biggest and most elaborate dog fighting compounds they've ever seen. MALE REPORTER (VOICEOVER): PETA says there's no choice but to destroy 53 of the 66 dogs taken from Michael Vick's home, now in federal custody. DAPHNA: These dogs are deadly machines to other animals. They've been programmed to kill. They can't even be housed in the same kennel at the shelter. We have absolutely no doubt that the most humane option for them is to be released from the world that treated them as if they were garbage from the moment they were born. REBECCA HUSS: So why is animal law important? Normally, it's a death sentence if a dog is seized from dog fighting property. This case was different because, for years, animal rescue and advocacy organizations had been telling governmental authorities these dogs don't have to die. One of the things that we have to deal with as lawyers and lawyers to be is that we know that, under the law, animals are considered personal property. Most of the time, people don't even hear about dog fighting cases. Because of the status of one defendant in particular, the general public started asking the government why do you have to kill these dogs. The judge in this case said that he had gotten 3,000 emails about this case. His administrative assistant was taking 200 calls a day. The title I was given by the court was guardian backslash special master. The federal courts have the ability to appoint a special master to make recommendations to the court. I thought it was a great idea to put guardian in the title, because we often think of guardians as guardians for children, or guardians for people who don't have capacity to make decisions on their own. No matter what decisions I made, I knew there'd be criticism. If all the dogs could be saved, there'd be people saying I shouldn't have. If I had to recommend euthanizations of any dogs, I know that I would have gotten criticism for that as well. Two dogs exhibited behavior or we had known history that was of public safety concern. The first dog, Merrill, had shown reactivity to people. The second dog, Lucas, had a known history of being a grand champion fighter. The decision with Merrill and Lucas was whether they would either be euthanized or whether they'd be at sanctuary for life. There was a substantial number of dogs ready for a foster care environment. Then there were dogs that would not walk through doors because they would pancake. They'd essentially put themselves as low to the ground as possible. They may have some fear issues, but certainly were dogs that weren't ready to necessarily go out into the wide world right away. The dogs that were dog reactive I knew might be more likely to be in an sanctuary environment for life. We didn't know whether I would have to make a recommendation to euthanize dogs because we did not know whether rescue organizations would step up and offer to take the dogs. For some rescue organizations, the goal is to bring a dog in, provide the dog the necessary support and training, and get the dog out to an appropriate placement so they can bring another dog in. DONNA REYNOLDS: BAD RAP is in the Oakland hills. It's a small rescue facility. And we have a half acre dedicated to the dogs. This has become a halfway house where the dogs can come and decompress. Some of them come from cruelty cases, for example, dog fighting cases. It's a peaceful place, quiet, sunlight. It offers them the opportunity to finally rest. Many of them have never had the opportunity to enjoy being a dog. Our hope was to help people fall in love with the dogs that we were falling in love with. The dogs that we were falling in love with had big, fat heads and big, huge smiles and short hair. And many people call them pit bulls. They have different looks, different sizes. The one thing they have in common is there is a lot of stigma attached to them. But those of us that love them find them to be quite wonderful as family companions. Good. Down. Good. Good, girl. The Vick case came out in the news. And the first thing that crossed my mind was they're going to kill all the dogs. And we thought, my God, we can't let this happen. Come on, baby girl. NICOLE RATTAY: BAD RAP and the ASPCA had done their evaluations of the dogs. Come on, let's go. Come on. NICOLE RATTAY: There were 13 dogs that needed to be transported from Virginia to the west coast. Dogs always been treated as evidence in these situations, but they're live evidence. You know, they can't be warehoused. We researched a few plans about how we might get the dogs back. And we settled on renting an RV. TIM RACER: Nicole and Steve put that cross country RV on their credit card instead of our credit card, because it would've maxed us out. At the time, yeah, we were down there. Going to pick up some doggies. TIM RACER: But we knew we had to do it. This case was so important. It just had to be done. NICOLE RATTAY: We didn't know these dogs. We didn't know how they would react to being crated in the RV, how they would react to each other. We didn't know any of that. I mean, the whole thing was kind of an unknown. There were two routes from Virginia to the west coast. We ended up opting for the more southern route, so we could avoid places that had laws against pit bull type dogs. We certainly didn't want to get stopped and questioned. At a rest stop in Arkansas, there was a gentleman who was doing landscaping maintenance. I'd seen him watching us. And he came over and he said you really need to get out of here with the dogs. 10 miles down the road, they'll take 'em from you. So, apparently, we were close to somewhere that had breed specific legislation. And pit bull type dogs, apparently, were restricted in some way or completely illegal. So we finished what we were doing and got back on the road. STEVE: One of our travellers loves the sun. NICOLE RATTAY: We were thrilled, but we were exhausted. We were ready to be home. Tim and Donna had prepared their house and made room for all the crates. Each dog got out, got a quick walk, and then into their living room to await the next step. It's just a crazy feeling, to think, my God, what are we doing. We have Vick's dogs in our living room and they're evidence in a federal dog fighting case. And I can't even tell my neighbors what's going on. I really had no intention of getting into pit bull rescue. It was not in my life plan. I'm an artist, you know. I want to make beauty in the world. And 15 years ago, this dog came crashing into our world. I met her at the Berkeley Animal Care Services, and she was going to be euthanized because they were very full. And I took one look at her and I felt uneasy, because I didn't understand this pit bull mythology. She wagged the tip of her tail very slowly and gave me this sweet submissive gesture. And I just felt sorry for her. And so I said we'll try to get her a home. How hard can it be, right? She's beautiful, she's young. There's gotta be some sucker out there. Trying to find her a home was really a trick. What we ended up doing was hearing every myth and misconception that people held about the breed. And I started to get angry. I thought, you know what, this is a lovely animal and you're telling me terrible things about her. And, you know, it's not true. As time went on, we recognized there was a huge need for helping people overcome the misconceptions that were condemning dogs like her to death. I fell in love with her. She asked me to step outside of myself and to be more compassionate. I'm going to tear up because I hate that I was never... that I was... there was a point in my life when I wasn't compassionate towards these animals. And she asked me to be honest with who she was. And so she changed me. That's a good girl. OK. After about six months, we said that's it. We're going to keep this one. A, because we can't find her a home. And, B, we have fallen in love with this creature and she has... she has changed her life. And we said, OK, lead the way, Sally. You can lead the way. She completely changed my career path by being the inspiration for my first carving. When people typically think of a carousel animal, they think of a horse. Sally's built like a horse. She's just this gorgeous little beast. BAD RAP is my seven day a week job, and then the carving is whenever I can fit it in. It's easy to forget about all the problems and all the crap going on in the world if I'm tooling away at a dog head. It all goes away. That these drugs from Michael Vick's bad news kennels could be rescued and become some families devoted pet represents a dramatic change in dog fighting cases. DONNA REYNOLDS: It's the first time federal authorities have allowed a full scale rescue effort of fighting dogs. Normally, these dogs are put to death. REPORTER: Johnny seems like a lover, not a fighter. He's super cute, so I'm sure, with being on the program and everything tonight, your phone's going to be ringing off the hook. DONNA REYNOLDS: Johnny was one of the more well-adjusted dogs coming out of the case. He was kind of naughty. He was full of himself. He had caveman manners. I mean, he had no manners. He was a little bit of a handful. We had to look at the foster homes that were available to see what we thought they could handle. And somehow, it all came together. Some really great people raised their hands. Where are we going, Johnny? I met Johnny one day after I got here from a road trip from Virginia. We gonna go to the park? I had an opening in the house here. Because we only foster one at a time. What I liked about Chris is he has a real sense of humor. And I thought, well, this little Johnny dog can be a little bit naughty. And I bet, Chris, you're going to enjoy that and you're going to have fun with that. It's not going to frustrate you. Oh, that's a good boy. Give me a kiss, one more kiss. Yes, you're a good boy. I was asked a couple months prior to hold the spot. I wasn't told why, but I was just to hold a spot. And then about a week out is when I found out that these dogs were coming here and that spot was being held for one of them. So I had no idea what was coming our way. Was I going to get a scarred up old dog? Or was I going to get a dog that looked like somebody from the World of Wrestling Association that you see on TV? You have pictures in your mind and you're thinking I'm going to get Lou-Ferrigno-looking dog here. And, hm. You met Johnny and he's this little squirt that looks like a cow. And you're like really? I mean, completely the opposite of what you would think. Here you go, buddy. He's just so cute, in a funky little way. I mean, he's a funky little dog. He really is. Can you sit? Thank you, good boy. Every foster takes a lot of time and every foster's a challenge. We had no plans on keeping him. We were just going to give him the best possible skills we could to help him along his way. He was a bit scrambled. We don't know what he experienced, but I did know for a fact how much stress he was suffering. You could see it. It was obvious. Running water, of course, sent him scrambling. I have no idea, but maybe he had never encountered running water. Pots and pans, the garbage truck, stairs, he had his little demons. The first day Johnny and I took a walk, he didn't know whether to go left, right, forward, backward. He just tied me up in the leash. I've been attached to a lot of fosters before, but I let 'em go, because there was always the next one that needed a foster home. It's pretty hard to give all of this of yourself to a little animal and hand him off. I mean it's pretty tough. It was my time to keep one, and it was Johnny. And he was going to stay. Good boy. REBECCA HUSS: Some of these dogs were not ready to go into a foster home based environment. So the day I received the Best Friends application was a great day, because I knew I was probably going to be able to make a recommendation that would save all or almost all of these dogs. There's very few organizations in the country that have been established as long as Best Friends Animal Society, that have the physical capacity that Best Friends Animal Society has, the support from the public, from an economic standpoint, the Best Friends Animal Society has, and the expertise to take on dogs with special needs. But even Best Friends had to really put forward a significant amount of effort to take on 22 dogs at once. For any organization, bringing on that many dogs is a big commitment. The traditional historic relationship to dogs and fight busts was simply to regard them as damaged goods to kill them. This is something that we had to do. What's up, little mail man. FRANCIS BATTISTA: It was the right thing to do. When you look at it from the point of view of the needs of the animals, we were the ones who could care for these animals. We'd been advocating for their survival. We'd been advocating for them to be given a chance. If we are advocates for their lives and advocates for them to be given a chance and to be related to as individuals, how could we not step forward and give them that chance if we were the only ones who could? Come on, handsome. Come on, handsome man. REBECCA HUSS: This is the type of dog Best Friends Animal Society takes on all the time. They really do take on the hardest cases. MICHELLE WEAVER: Based on the assessments, Best Friends took the 22 dogs that had the most challenges. We ended up taking the dogs that needed us the most. When the dogs first arrived, it was a little chaotic. Probably half of them were just very shut down, very nervous about everything. They were unsure about us. Some of the dogs were almost the opposite. They were excited, and nervous, and maybe a little anxious. We were seeing who was reactive towards other dogs through the fences. The best that we could hope for was that we could show the general public that you don't have to be afraid of the dogs just because of the situation that they came from. FRANCIS BATTISTA: Best Friends is a national animal welfare organization. No kill has always been our mission and are call, to end shelter killing. So a sanctuary, as we see it, is intended for animals that are not immediately available or ready for adoption, so that might need some help or rehabilitation. The animals that come to Best Friends, if needed, can stay here and have a quality life for their entire lives. But, really, our intention is to find them good homes. We started the sanctuary in 1984. There were about 20 founders. We were looking for a way of life that was meaningful. And kindness to animals was a fundamental component of where we were coming from. We had been doing animal rescue over the years. And it was always our dream to have a sanctuary. So I always had my eye for somewhere that we might be able to do what we wanted to do. I was traveling through this area, driving up the canyon here. I was absolutely blown away. It's one of these locations where you kind of have the sense of the creation of the planet. The place has that level of primalness to it. It's so monumental. The landscape is so spectacular, that it just puts you in perspective on who and what we are, how integrated we are with it all, but how infinitesimally small we are. When we started, it was just a few of us out here shoveling sand, literally. I think we always had this idea that we were going to change the world. We certainly felt the world needed changing. Whether or not we were going to change it or not, I don't know. MICHELLE WEAVER: We don't know what each of the dogs went through at Michael Vick's compound. When Cherry first arrived, he was really scared. If you tried to put him on a leash, he would pancake, which is basically just get as low as possible. You could interpret it a couple of ways. He's being somewhat submissive, trying to tell you, hey, I'm not a threat to you, trying to protect himself, trying to make himself really small, so that, you know, maybe you won't notice him as much. Come on, Cherry. It was kind of heartbreaking because he just seemed so scared of everything. Working with shy dogs can take a lot of time. You really have to figure out how to help them change their perceptions. They're afraid. Their emotional response to seeing a new person is fear. It's OK, buddy, come here. I would sit with him quietly, just for him to realize it's OK, we're just going to be in the same room together. Because that allows them to start getting to know that people are safe. You're not going to do scary things. There was a day that we were sitting in the room together. Come on, Cherry. And he finally made the decision that it was OK. He was going to come over and sit next to me, and it was OK for me to pet him. That's huge when you're working with a dog like Cherry. He was able to make the decision on his own. And then he decided it was OK to let me touch him, and that maybe it was actually even kind of nice. Hi. It was a big moment for him, and a big moment for me. Those are the moments that it's like, oh, my gosh, I just want to jump up and down for joy, but, of course, that would scare him, so I just had to be excited inside that he was actually finally coming up to me. Come on, Cherry. Come on. Once we got Cherry to the point where he was asking for a little bit of attention and handling, our job was to help him go to that next step. Come on, Cherry. And start taking him out of that space that was comfortable for him. You can do it. Good boy. But we knew that it was going to have to be in baby steps. Come on, Cherry, you can do it. Yay. Yay, good job. Just because they get comfortable there, they don't know that this new thing is safe. They don't know that the trail is safe. They don't know what a car is maybe. So we just kind of have to start from where he was at and just hope. Our hope was that he could really come out of his shell, at least enough to function in a regular home environment. You're doing good, Cherry. JOHN GARCIA: We knew that we would essentially be responsible for these dogs for the rest of their lives. But at the same time, we wanted to animals to be given a second chance when coming from a fighting background. And the only way to do that is to lead by example. We weren't really sure how long we would be taking care of some of these guys or how long it would take to get them into homes. Good girl. Personally, I always try to look at the positive aspects of things. But there is that lingering kind of doubt in the back of your head of, you know, is this possible. Come on. Handsome Dan, I think, was named because he was just so handsome. He's definitely got that look to him. He's kind of like that Brad Pitt of dogs, you know? It doesn't matter even if he's having a bad hair day, he's still just gorgeous. He definitely fits the profile that a lot of people would imagine if they were imagining a pit bull from a dog fighting ring. His behavior, though, is completely opposite for the most part. Come say hi. Come say hi. Come here, bro. That poor kid probably had zero interactions that were positive with any humans. He would put himself into the corner and literally push his face into the corner so he was trying to disappear. What are we doing, Handsome? There's that old school misconception of the dog will do what I tell him to do because they're a dog and I'm a human. Simply doesn't work that way. They have to trust us and we have to trust them. Hey, buddy. In the beginning, he wouldn't come near me. He wouldn't look at me, he wouldn't do anything. He was literally so shy and shut down that I felt bad even going into his run. My new worst case scenario, he would live at the sanctuary, which, in my opinion, is not a bad thing. He really liked it here. Good boy, Handsome. Look at you. But, obviously, best case scenario, everybody goes into a great home and has the love and attention that they truly deserve. Hi, Cherry. Are we going to go for a ride? Hi. You do kind of have to take a leap of faith when working with dogs like Cherry. Because you don't really know how far you can help them get. And you do have to pay really close attention or you're going to miss those very subtle moments when they've made progress. Good job. Most people look for these big moments where, wow, that was a breakthrough. And you have to look for those little, wow, he took a couple of extra steps with me today. That's amazing. As we were getting to know the Michael Vick dogs, we were noticing that a lot of the dogs seemed really interested in the other dogs. And we find that a lot of with shy dogs. They gravitate to other dogs. They don't really gravitate to people. They don't know how to have a relationship with us yet. With Cherry, he actually seemed very interested in meeting other dogs. We decided to introduce him to another one of the Vick dogs, Willy, who seemed like he was interested in meeting other dogs. Oh, there's a tail wag. There's a tail wag. When we went to introduce them, Cherry wanted to sniff his ear. Good boy, Cherry. Good boy. That's OK, I got 'em. I got 'em. I got 'em. I got 'em, don't worry. MICHELLE WEAVER: Luckily, no one was injured and we had to rethink who we were going to introduce Cherry too. I think that's probably enough for the day. Cherry didn't seem like he wanted to get in a fight or lunge back at Willy, so we still pretty good that we could introduce him to other dogs. And it gave us more information about Willy. One of the other dogs that we thought might like the company of other dogs was Handsome Dan, so we decided to introduce him to Cherry and see what happened. What do you think about that dog? And they almost immediately started playing. Good boy, Cherry. Good boy. MICHELLE WEAVER: And really acting like a normal dog, which was pretty incredible because both were fearful. Look at you. He loved dogs. He was very social. Once we discovered that about him, it helped us to give him more experiences and give him a better quality of life. He was so afraid of so many things, and here is something that he really enjoyed. And it really opened up his world. Cherry, down. MICHELLE WEAVER: It was encouraging to see a little bit of their potential. OK, come on. MICHELLE WEAVER: To watch them actually relax and have fun. Play easy, Cherry. MICHELLE WEAVER: I'm sure some people thought we were crazy, but if a dog can get along well with other dogs, it really increases their chances of going home. TIM RACER: I think everybody has their favorite breed, but I think so many people love the fat heads because they're just this wonderful blend of the active working dog and the couch potato, the best of both worlds. DONNA REYNOLDS: The history of pit bulls is the history of America. They were brought over to the United States from the UK, along with people's prized possessions. They showed up frequently in advertising. The earliest advertisements included illustrations of pit bulls. They showed up in Hollywood. MAN (VOICEOVER): Canine society is all agog and atwitter this afternoon as Major Curr of the Doggy Currs entertains a tea. DONNA REYNOLDS: The famous example being "Little Rascals" and "Our Gang." In the early 1900s, they were considered the family dog. They were the dogs that were very friendly and would protect children and kept around as family dogs. The dogs that were looked at as the bad dogs through the years change. In the mid 1900s, we had the German Sheppard, but the German Sheppard went through a complete rehabilitation of image when Rin-Tin-Tin became a hero dog. Then it became the Doberman. MAN (VOICEOVER): In spite of everything to dislodge him, he'll hang on like grim death. DR. FRANK MCMILLAN: Then it change to the Rottweiler. Then it became the pit bull. When pit bulls bite, they bite, and they bite, and they continue to bite. MAN (VOICEOVER): Part macho status symbol, part bodyguard, part weapon. When you walking with a pit bull, you know, you like a king. Everybody going to move out your way. DR. FRANK MCMILLAN: The media jumped on this pit bull thing. And, unfortunately, it's kind of stuck, so they're looked at as the best dog of the day. Obviously, many people embrace these dogs as family companions. There are also many people who have exploited them, hurt them, abused them. As long as the dogs are matched equal weight, I can see why there was anything cruel about it. Will this dog fight one day? Uh, probably will, yeah, mhm. TIM RACER: Some of the dog fighters want to say, oh, they love it. Well, they've been manipulated into this. If you don't cut it as a fighting dog, then they kill you. So it's a no win situation. The last 150 years, dog fighter have been trying to undo tens of thousands of years of mother nature saying, no, these dogs are pack animals that cooperate. They'd rather do something different. They'd rather chase a Frisbee. They'd rather go for a walk or swim than do what dog fighters made them do. SUSAN WEIDEL: Dogs are so special because they are such great companions really. They're always happy to see you when you come home, no matter how bad you feel or how good you feel. They are not very demanding in terms of their companionship. And, you know, life just happens with dogs. And they go wherever they want and they take you along with them. I like the world of dogs. It's an interesting place to be. What do we see out there? When Little Red first came to Best Friends, I decided I would sponsor her. And when I sent in a check, they sent me this picture. Even though I had never met her in person, I just felt like she needed somebody. Little Red came with a trainer from Best Friends. And the trainer stayed with us for three days. And on the last day, she left and drove away. Little Red looked down the road and I think for the first time understood that her trainer was not coming back. She spent over three years in sanctuary and she had people who loved her and animals who provided her with comfort and play. And I think she liked her life there. I didn't know how she would come to accept this as her home. Little would be too nervous to come inside the house. She just couldn't make the walk up the steps and across the threshold. I would have to carry her into the house. She didn't have a problem going out. She had a problem coming in. I had just finished reading a book about the Vick case. And one of the things that struck me was the way that the out sheds were set up. This building was painted black and all the windows were blacked out. There was a set of steps that led up, and that's where the fighting pit was. So I think that going up any steps and crossing a strange threshold was, for Little, a reminder of being thrown into the pit. Every day, I would wonder what should I do. And at the end of the day, I would always think to myself you should do nothing and just give her more time. There you go, good girl. I have a vet who does acupuncture and she comes to your house to do it. Oh, that feels good, doesn't it? Little would sleep curled up in a tight ball. She would fold in on herself as tight as she could get. And you could just tell she carried a lot of stress in her body. As the treatment went on, Little started to unwind. She was literally unspooling herself. She actually seemed to lengthen. It was, I think, the first time that she had ever really fully been able to relax in my home. MICHELLE WEAVER: There was an application, someone interested in Cherry. And they wanted to know if he was ready to be adopted. So Paul and Melissa came out for a visit. They brought their dog, Madison. Hi, Cherry. MICHELLE WEAVER: You just have to, at some point, accept that this is where we're at, and this is who you are, and that's OK. Hi, bud. How're you doing? MICHELLE WEAVER: And then, from there, you really have to look for that home that is also going to accept them for who they are. When we first got there, I ended up going in first to meet Cherry. Here you go, buddy. He was completely shut down, didn't want anything to do with me. He's such a handsome little guy. MICHELLE WEAVER: I guess the question for me was are they going to be OK with giving Cherry the time he needs to trust them. And are they going to be patient enough to give him enough time so that they can actually see who he really is? That's a good boy. Al right, buddy. We'll let you relax a little. We sat down with him we just pet him. We just let him know that we were safe, we weren't going to hurt him. And, I mean, that lasted for three hours. MICHELLE WEAVER: Paul and Melissa were amazing. They sat in there for a really long time. All he ever needed was a couch. Just being quiet, letting him get to know them a little bit. We arranged for the transport and it was really hard for me to load him up, to say goodbye. OK, we're going to come up here. Cherry, you're being ridiculous. Hey, hey. I was super happy for him to get into a home, but it meant I wasn't going to get to spend time with him anymore. Yup, you're OK. That is the hard part of my job is that I know I can't take them all home. And if I can't take them, I don't want to hold them back from that. Good boy. Nope, you have to stay in. Oh, no. Back you go, Cherry, no. You know, it was really bittersweet. I just really had to say goodbye and have a lot of faith that Paul and Melissa were going to give him an incredible life. WOMAN (ON PHONE): The bill will be heard in the house health community. We have leadership, both in the Senate and in the speaker on the house side. So there's a very strong interest in animal issues. This would get rid of the stigma of dangerous on all fight bust dogs in the state of Delaware. WOMAN (ON PHONE): That's right. There are 13 states that deem victims of cruelty seized in fight busts as dangerous or vicious. That basically means that they aren't adopted out. I am a lawyer and a lobbyist. What I do is draft bills to get rid of the stigma on fight bust dogs, or to get rid of breed discrimination. Breed discriminatory laws and ordinances really started taking hold in the '80s. MAN (VOICEOVER): Across the country, 50 communities in 14 states have attempted to ban pit bulls or enact vicious dog laws. WOMAN (VOICEOVER): Since 1982, at least a dozen people, including seven children, have been killed by pit bulls. In the 250 some odd fatal dog attacks from 2000 to 2009, breed could only be determined in 17% of the cases. Most of the dogs were isolated. They were abused or neglected. Some were starving. A lot is in the control of the owner. Breed discrimination actually is panic policy making. Some officials will decide that all the dogs of this breed are evil and they need to be exterminated. And so they will round them up and kill them. MAN (VOICEOVER): What Denver calls the city animal shelter some pet lovers called death row. Denver first banned pit bulls in 1989, making Denver, along with Cincinnati and Miami, one of three major cities to prohibit the breed. There are some bad dogs of any breed, but there are a lot of wonderful dogs of every breed that can be wonderful pets. There's so much breed discrimination in the United States right now. And in America, every responsible citizen should be allowed to own and love any breed of dog they choose. It's that simple. Every kid grows up dreaming of playing in professional baseball. Never thought in a million years half the stuff that I've accomplished that I would ever do, but I've thrown a no hitter and a perfect game. MAN (VOICEOVER): The 18th perfect game in major league history, 27 batters, no hits, no walks, no errors. JAMIE BUEHRLE: It's kind of a joke between a lot of baseball wives that people often think our life is rainbows and butterflies every day, and my biggest worry is where I'm going to get my nails done. And I'm not going to deny that we've had perks, but he's gone for 162 games a season. And then you add spring training to it. It's very lonely and very hard. We have three Vizslas and one pit bull. And Slater's very laid back. Everyone says he's the laziest dog they've ever seen. You'll usually find him out in the sun lounging around. MARK BUEHRLE: For the stereotype that pit bull dogs get, he's completely the opposite. So he's an awesome dog and an awesome family dog. A played for Chicago White Sox for 11 years, and then I signed with the Miami Marlins. JAMIE BUEHRLE: I was aware that Miami had breed discriminatory laws. It wasn't an option to do anything but find a place that we could all go. We were able to live, luckily, outside of Miami Dade. It was about a 40 minute commute. MARK BUEHRLE: We found a town that allowed Slater to be there, then it was an easy decision. We went into the off season, obviously, thinking that we were going to be with Miami again the following year. MARK BUEHRLE: Got a call that I got traded. And I'm like where are you trading me to and he said Toronto. JAMIE BUEHRLE: Find the ball. Fetch it up. At first, our heads were spinning, thinking a different country, what just happened. We thought we were going to be in Miami. We had bought a house. Where's the ball? Get the ball. It started resonating with me that Toronto has a ban. Slater. JAMIE BUEHRLE: And it's actually the entire province of Ontario that has the ban, so there was no easy solution or short commute. We had several friends that offered to keep Slater for us during the season. But when we adopted Slater, we made a commitment. He was a part of our family. And you just don't leave a part of your family behind. We just had to sit down and decide what we were going to do. And the ultimate decision was for them to stay at home with Slater. We try to go not more than two weeks, whether they come up here to Toronto or her and the kids fly to a city on the road wherever we're going to be at. I have a family. I have kids, I have a wife. I have dogs at home. That's who I am. And when I come here and sit in the apartment, just chilling out by myself, it gets tougher every day. What are you guys doing today? CHILD (ON PHONE): Today, we're going to go roller skating. You are? That sounds like a lot of fun. JAMIE BUEHRLE: It really bothers Mark a lot. There's a lot of times that he'll call and we're just eating dinner in he's sad that he's there by himself. We faced a lot of criticism that we decided to speak out and say that we were not going to get rid of Slater. We weren't going to leave him. We were going to stay apart. Many people thought that I'm choosing my dog over what's best for my children and them being with their father. But we truly believe that we're teaching our children compassion and that animals are not a convenience. When you adopt an animal, it's for its entire life. It's so hard when you look at your dog every day and see how sweet they are and you see how great they are with your children and everybody that comes in our house, and you think someone is telling me no because they think that this dog is a dangerous dog and they've never met him. That is nothing but ignorance and discrimination. It's nothing short of that. REPORTER (VOICEOVER): Suspended NFL star Michael Vick is out of prison. The former quarterback to the Atlanta Falcons was let out of Leavenworth before dawn Wednesday to begin home confinement in Virginia. FEMALE REPORTER (VOICEOVER): Commissioner Roger Goodell suspended Vick indefinitely back in August of 2007, but he said he would review Vick's status once the prison sentence was complete. You're listening to Richard Hunter. We're talking about the Michael Vick case. REPORTER (VOICEOVER): Michael Vick has been conditionally reinstated by NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell. I don't like being lied to, like anybody else, but we have to go forward. We have to move forward. REPORTER (VOICEOVER): The former Atlanta Falcons quarterback can immediately take part in preseason practices, workouts, and meetings, if he can find a team that will sign him. What I like best about my work is talking to people. I like communicating with them and I like being able to share my perspective and information that I've gathered. I covered the Michael Vick story on my radio show for the better part of two years. It was amazing how much people did not know about this case. The media is partially to blame for that. Anybody who would be involved in this type of thing is deplorable. Anybody who would be involved in this type of thing is a liability to our society. Did they talk about the dog fighting? Sure. Do they talk about his football career? Yes. But did they talk about the USDA report outlined by eyewitness accounts when Michael Vick took his children's dogs away from them, and threw them into the pit to kill them, and laughed as it happened? No. Most people don't know he executed his family's pets for his own amusement. With the number of dogs involved, with whole facilities built for it, and then you put on top of it that it is one of the most well-known professional athletes in the country, after reading the entire USDA report, I couldn't believe Michael Vick ever had time to play football. I can vividly remember show after show, day after day, covering the horrific facts of this story. I don't think I had ever had a lower of opinion of humanity than I did by that point. REPORTER (VOICEOVER): Micheal Vick has landed with the Eagles. Vick's agent, Joel Siegel, confirmed on Thursday that a deal has been made. I'm excited about the opportunity. Our country is a country of second chances and I paid my debt to society. RICHARD HUNTER: As I covered the story, I began to wonder what had happened to the dogs. I had Michelle Besmehn, from Best Friends, on my radio show to give an update on how the dogs were doing. And at the end of the interview, off the air, I said I would like to be considered, if any of these dogs ever do come available for adoption. Come on, Mel. RICHARD HUNTER: A number of months later, they contacted me. And they said we think we have the first few dogs potentially available for adoption. When I went to Best Friends sanctuary to get Mel, I was not prepared for how particularly healing that was going to be for me as a person. The first thing I was struck with was I didn't even have to say Michael Vick. I didn't even have to talk about that guy because nobody there cares about him. Good job, Mel. Put your silhouette over there. RICHARD HUNTER: When I first minute Mel, he trembled. It wasn't until we took our first car ride later on that afternoon that Mel really kind of came out of his shell. Mel loves car rides. If you're going to say it, you better spell it unless you are intending to get in the car and ride right then. He seems to understand that there is something magical about being in the car where he feels safe. There's a barrier, even if it's just glass, in between him and whatever's on the other side of the car door. The first weeks and months that Mel was in our home were big revelations. Any new situation he's in, it's almost like you can see the wheels turning in his mind, you know. Am I safe? Is this OK? I've never heard Mel bark. The only way that I know Mel can speak is sometimes, when he's sleeping next to me, he will dream and make some noises in his sleep. That's the only time he's ever made a noise. Otherwise, he's completely silent. Good boy, Mel. I had always had it in my mind that I would like to have a conversation with Michael Vick. A couple of years ago, I was living in Dallas. And it came to my attention that he was going to be making a series of public appearances. I had so much in my mind that was not said by the rest of the media that I work in. I went to the location where he was presented a key to the city of Dallas. I would like to personally present to Micheal Vick the key to the city of Dallas, Texas. RICHARD HUNTER: I had been given permission by the organizers to be there as an invited member of the media. They said stand right here. He's going to exit the stage. He will walk by. That is your opportunity to ask him to speak with you. Hey, Mike, Richard Hunter, 1190 AM radio. Back up. Excuse me, back up, back up. RICHARD HUNTER: He saw the newspaper article from the LA Times that I was holding up, the picture of Mel, the headline, understanding that I was one of the people that had adopted one of his dogs. He looked me in the eye. And in that candid moment, he was completely unprepared for the fact that we would be coming eye to eye. Nothing there. Not two questions, Mike? Nothing, man. How many times I'm going to tell you. I'm going to ask you more time. Get the fuck out my face. RICHARD HUNTER: He continued to walk right by me. You said you were worried about the dogs, Mike. Now's your chance to talk. RICHARD HUNTER: A key to the city of Dallas says that we're trusting you with the security of the city. It's a symbolic honour. I responded to the city council that it was going to cost a fortune now to go around and have all the locks changed because one of the members of Dallas City Council had given our house key to a convicted felon. The man who confronted Michael Vick after Vick got a key to the city of Dallas was given his own special case. Richard Hunter was honored over the weekend with the East Lake Pet Orphanage's John LaBella Award. One fellow counsel person, Angela Hunt, spoke out publicly about it. And much to her credit, couple of weeks later, surprised Mel with his own figurative key to the city of Dallas that was a giant dog biscuit baked into the shape of a key. We've spent a lot of time asking ourselves over and over again what the hell is wrong with people. And tonight, you guys have given us a chance to see what's right about people. I really appreciate this, thank you. Come on in, buddy. Come on. Come on, Mel. Good boy. Good boy. Come on. People say to me, well, do you hate Michael Vick. Is this just a vendetta? No, because he doesn't really understand what I'm talking about. That's the sadness of it. Come on, Mel. Let's go, buddy. The people I'm really talking to are everybody else around him, the society that's around him. MAN (ON RADIO): Folks, the NFL is a business. And I can guarantee you that if the public made a big enough stake with their dollars, the outcome with this thing would have been a whole lot different. The problem is that there's still a demand to consume the Michael Vick product from the fan. There's often times where I say on this show, you know, athletes should get a second chance. But, I guess, without knowing whether he's been rehabbed... well, I mean, it kind of concerns me. And I think because people get so caught up in the sports fandom, they think that somehow he's entitled to go back and reclaim that NFL program. REPORTER (VOICEOVER): Vick is back with footwear manufacturer, Nike, more than two years after Nike cut its ties to Vick due to his involvement with a dog fighting ring. Vick has gone from NFL superstar, to disgraced outcast, to one of the highest paid players in the league, worth $100 million. RICHARD HUNTER: As tough as it is for me to talk about Vick, it's something that's very important for me to do. I like to point out to anyone that wants to say that it's time for Michael Vick and all of us to just move on, that Mel hasn't completely moved on yet. Good job. I wasn't there to protect Mel when this happened to him, but I'm here now. And I have a platform to talk about it. And I'm going to continue to talk about it for as long as Michael Vick and I are both sharing space on the planet. Good boy. Hello. Hi. MARK STOUTZENBERGER (VOICEOVER): We never thought twice about taking a dog from a fighting situation. It was good to finally meet you. We had a lot of experience, at the time, working with dogs from tough backgrounds. And the amount of experience that we had being around fearful dogs, we really hadn't experienced anything to that degree. Handsome Dan was just so scared. HEATHER GUTSHALL: He didn't need to trust us, and he was trying. That was pretty amazing, given how shutdown and fearful he was. I was definitely surprised to see how quickly he warmed up to Heather and Mark. MARK STOUTZENBERGER: He's a really good dog. JOHN GARCIA: It's just a really gratifying feeling to see him say, hey, you know, these people are cool and I want to be part of your family. We tend to sometimes think that once an animal gets placed into a home, that it's happily ever after. In reality, it's just another section of his life. And there is going to be a lot of hurdles. I'm gonna miss you, man. It is just the start to another adventure. HEATHER GUTSHALL: When Dan first arrived, he had never been in the home before. That was a steep learning curve for him. He had to be carried downstairs. He had to be carried from room to room. But that very quickly progressed to feeling safe in certain rooms of the home. You know, a lot of stress for him, and our fearful dog will stay fearful if never challenged. So he did find the spaces that he'd try to isolate and we would kind of close off those rooms and just gently start to have him integrate with the family. MARK STOUTZENBERGER: In the house, there was a lot of things that he had to get used to. He was afraid of regular noises that you'd never think why is he afraid of a dishwasher running. Stupid us. He's afraid of it because he's never heard it before. So it's terrifying to him to hear sounds that he never heard. HEATHER GUTSHALL: I wasn't even able to read in bed, which was something I enjoyed doing. I would place him up in the bed and he would get... get cozied in for the night. But even the turning of newspaper pages would just terrify him. There were times when I wondered was pushing him going to do more harm than good and are we going to have the strength and the forethought to just say, OK, we've pushed him far enough. And here's where he's going to be and we'll just keep him happy in that place. CRIS COHEN: Johnny's been my dog going on seven years. He's a stellar little dog. He really it. He doesn't have bad days. Johnny, come. Pit bulls are definitely clowns in little dog suits. Are you ready? Go get it. Go bring that Kong. Go on. Go find your Kong. They have a zest for life. They enjoy fun and antics. They are very animated dogs. Good boy. Once you can get the cloud of stress off of them, they start to show you who they are. Good boy. Sit up. OK. And once you find out who this dog is, what their personality traits are, who they are, you can kind of have fun with them. Johnny has probably developed over 30 tricks throughout the years we've been working together. Hi-ho. Good boy. CRIS COHEN: He knows everything from sit, roll over. Right turn. Johnny, left turn. CRIS COHEN: He can turn left. He can turn right. Sweet. Good boy. CRIS COHEN: If Johnny read and wrote English, his head would be triple the size of what it is now. Who is this, Donna? This is Johnny Justice. Johnny Justice, I have such a crush on. CRIS COHEN: He's been on cover books and magazines. Gund made a copy of Johnny that you can actually buy in the stores. I still find it humbling. I mean, we're just regular folks with a dog and crazy little background. He's really a gentle little dog that is the happiest in life when he's with people. OK, mister, come on. Come on. Good work. Good boy. Come on, buddy. Johnny is a therapy dog. The Family House is an organization that works in conjunction with the children's hospital. And if you are outside of the area and your child needs treatment, they put the families up for free, give them a place to stay. So we go in there and just kind of visit, have fun. Oh, hey, guys, how are you? Hi, good. How are you? Good. Would you like to meet Johnny? Yes. We are nothing but a giant distraction. Therapy animals do many things. But the governing thing is they all must be very stable, highly trained animals. Some dogs are good with adults, some dogs are good with kids. When you work with dogs, you go with their strengths and you support 'em. And Johnny's just this little kid magnet. He's just good with kids. Everybody likes him, you know? Hi. We all know Johnny came out of Virginia. So people from the south, of course, are always NASCAR fans. Johnny, start your engine. Start it up. Rev the engine. Give it gas. Rev that engine. That's kind of cool. Stick 'em up. Bang. OK, good boy. Hey, guys, how are you? Kiss the doggy. You want to meet Johnny? If you've ever seen somebody who isn't feeling well and is in a strange place away from their home, and you come in with a little dog and it brightens their day, gets them to smile and giggle. Right turn. They ground you. We're a team. There is a camaraderie between us. It's a pretty special bond. There it is. Johnny brings a lot of love and joy to our house. OK, go to your house. Go on. He's my dog. Can't get between a boy and his dog. Today, 9,000 animals are dying in shelters every day. That's about 3 and 1/2, 4 million a year. PETA said that nice families don't go into shelters looking for pit bulls. Our experience has been that nice families do go into shelters looking for pit bulls. We see them all the time in our pet adoption centers in Los Angeles. Most pit bull type dogs that you encounter in a shelter have never had anything to do with dog fighting or a dog fighting ring. So many pit bulls and pit bulls mixes are dying in disproportionate numbers in shelters. And it's really a tragedy. It's unfortunate. It's a big, sweet dog and they cut his ears to make him look tough. Public perception of these dogs is often negative. And there's nothing negative about these dogs. You're a big mutt, aren't you? Yes, you are. One of our initiatives is aimed at redeeming the image of pit bulls. In recent years, especially subsequent to the work that's been done my Best Friends and others, there's really a nationwide groundswell in support of pit bull type dogs. So we're not alone on this. Now, the work is really engaged with shelters and rescue organizations around the country to help, perhaps, change some of the perceptions about these dogs. We say forward, left leg goes forward. Forward. When I first met a pit bull, I said, oh, you know, I've been told there's something wrong with this animal. Now see if you can get a look from your dog. Give them the look command while we're moving. And stop. Good. I didn't understand what it was, but there was a lot of baggage and mythology attached. And so I was skeptical. What's going on with this animal? Why's everybody so afraid of it? There are numerous myths that abound regarding pit bull terriers, that they're not good with cats, that they're bad children, that they have more pounds per square inch of bite pressure than any other dog, that they don't feel pain. One is that their jaws lock. Physiologically, they are no different than any other breed of dog. In fact, American pit bull terriers test better than golden retrievers and border collies in some of the American temperament testing studies. DONNA REYNOLDS: Even animal welfare people can fall for the myths. If you have to euthanize hundreds of pit bulls in your shelter, it's easier to believe that there's something wrong with them and to go home and sleep than to say, well, maybe some of them can be helped. Because then you have to change everything you do. LEDY VANKAVAGE: There are a lot of shelters that don't allow them to be adopted out. They just kill any dog they automatically deem as a pit bull terrier, which is inherently unfair. TIM RACER: You make the victim the problem. They come into somebody's home, the people don't do right by him. The pit bull ends up bearing the brunt of it, ends up in the shelter, and then, oh, gosh, well, these dogs are in the shelter. They must be problematic. It's ironic, but a specific breed fills up the shelter more than any other breed and they're the ones getting the least help. Well, they're just dogs and we just treat them as dogs. We're going to be OK. PAUL FIACCONE: We always thought it was going to be a lifelong journey for a charity. But we also didn't think he would come this far. He really feels our house is a safe place. He loves to go out in the backyard and sun himself. Be loves to run around, hop around, chase Madison around the backyard. He kind of enjoys just being a normal dog back there, I guess. When we first adopted Walker, he was kid. And he spent probably the first three weeks here soaking wet because Cherry just cleaned him all the time. He was just so happy to have this little kitten in his life. And it really, for whatever reason, boosted his confidence. It really brought him out of his shell even more. It's almost like he adopted Walker. He brought him in and kind of showed him the ropes a little bit, you know? We had a baby 18 months ago. Look. Yay. His name is Nova Lino. Give that to Cherry. Good boy. Good job. Cherry constantly licks him, his face, his hands, his feet. Pig. And a cow. That started from when we first Novi home. Look at the cow go. Car says beep beep. Beep, beep, beep. PAUL FIACCONE: It's just been wonderful to watch them just having a great time playing with each other. Just like any other dog, we take precautions as parents to ensure that everybody is safe, not just the baby, but the dogs too. Babies like to grab and pull, so we're always right there to ensure safety on all accounts. Prior to Novi, we do not need feed our dogs from the table or give them table scraps. This is where Novi, I think, is a bad influence on the dogs, and vice versa. MELISSA FIACCONE: So you think this is funny, huh? PAUL FIACCONE: Through Novi, the dogs have learned that he can be a good source of handouts of free food. And Novi also learned that, hey, it's fun to see these guys. He'll throw food down. When he gets tired of something, he likes to feed the dogs. MELISSA FIACCONE: Are you all done? PAUL FIACCONE: When they hear all done, they come running. It's like a call for them that, hey, here comes the food. Let's get there. And they come sprinting as fast as they can so they have first dibs on the good stuff. MELISSA FIACCONE: Most of time, Cherry is normal. And that was really all we wanted for him. We wanted him to be comfortable in this house, wanted him to greet people at the door. We wanted him to run around the backyard. The dogs are given a second chance. All of the dogs, not just Cherry, have taken this opportunity to really show the world that why shouldn't we have the chance. We're no different than any other dog. And Cherry has really become this heartbeat of our family. He's just such an amazing soul. He's just the easiest going guy who just wants to be loved. And he didn't want any bad to come out of him. It breaks my heart to think that somebody would hurt him because he's so innocent. And he's such a great dog. I just can't imagine our family without him. There's so many days where you come home from a long day at work and he's there greeting you with a big smile. You just start thinking to yourself what he went through and he can put a smile on his face. And it's... you know, it just makes... it makes your bad day just melt away. It's kind of hard to even compare. A duck, that's right. Good job. He has had a dramatic impact on our lives. PAUL FIACCONE: It's just been an amazing experience with him. He lived in the toy cupboard or on the nursery floor, and no one thought... after having him in our home for as long as we have, Dan's normal is not the same normal as it is for the average dog. Dan is never a dog that's going to be able to go on walks. He's ways too fearful for that. He's fearful of noises outside of our fence, the leash itself. But in the safety of our fence, Dan has found his normal. It's about the security that having a barrier provides. So Dan gets nervous when you take it outside because imagine if you spent the beginning part of your life having no security, what that's going to do to your state of mind. It must be awful. Want to get dressed? Come here. Oh. Oh, yes. And even the jackets. A fearful dog, those jackets, it makes them feel like they've got something around them. And it gives them more confidence because of it. People may think, oh, that's silly, you put clothes on your dog, but it's like a baby that needs to be swaddled. They want that security. MATT STOUTZENBERGER: How about this hat? - That's fancy. - Oh, yeah, that one. HEATHER GUTSHALL: Is Dan going to help dress the baby? No. HEATHER GUTSHALL: Aw. Ask him if that's the write one. Is that the right one? HEATHER GUTSHALL: Dan is scared of lots of things. But if Josephine does those things, he's not afraid of them. It's kind of that buffer that he needs. Heather babies Dan quite a bit. He's also got his very own special what she calls the pope mobile, which, like, really, we're going to buy this weird contraption that has three wheels. It's basically like a stroller for a dog. But it allows us to go places with Dan. Once you get beyond the fact that it looks a little silly, he loves it, you know? He can be in it and he's in an enclosed environment, so he's happy. He can go for a walk in the pope mobile. The pope mobile. It takes time, and patience, and a lot of love. And that's, I feel like, what Dan's got here. But he's given us so much more back, that it's been worth every second of it. Come on, bud. Yeah, there you go. The peninsula is a little place at a park near our house that I've been working on Dan for a few years. It's a small wooded trail with water on either side. He'll walk out with me and we'll sit there for few minutes at the end and then walk back. Everyone has a dog, or a cat, or an animal in their lives that they know will be the one for them. Dan is my one. And the trust that Dan has given me is not something that I would have ever expected from a dog like Dan. They have been so much more forgiving of our species than we could have ever been of theirs. It's amazing to see. FRANCIS BATTISTA: Not all of dogs rescued from Michael Vick are in adoptive homes. Seven of the dogs are still here at the sanctuary. We're talking about 22 dogs from a very specific, and particular, and extraordinary situation. But they are individuals and they should be treated as individuals. Three of the dogs are still too fearful of new places and people to go home at this point. But that may change. We're still working to help them overcome those fears. (DOG BARKING) FRANCIS BATTISTA: Some dogs of that group are very dog aggressive. They're in special care here. And it's unlikely that they're ever going to be adoptable. MICHELLE WEAVER: Both Tug and Willy don't like other dogs. They can't really interact with them. Dogs really know the difference between other dogs and people. A dog can have a great relationship with a person and not enjoy the company of other dogs. Willy not only doesn't want to interact with other dogs... come here, sweetie... but he tends to be really selective about the people he wants to be around. He seems to do best when we limit how many people interact with him. Good boy. FRANCIS BATTISTA: We knew that we weren't going to be able to totally transform all of them. And they will have good lives and they're enriched by caregivers and by animals here at the sanctuary. PAUL LINDLEY: You want your ball? Is that a yes? Denzel has been through a lot of trauma in his life. And sometimes it's hard for him to trust people. But when he finally breaks through that barrier of trust and likes a person, it's for life. Oh, I love you, Denzel. You're the best dog in the world. FRANCIS BATTISTA: Sadly, a couple of the dogs had passed away. Lucas was Michael Vick's champion and was ordered by the court not to be adopted because he had street value because of his championship lineage. The thing about fighting dogs is that the fighters use their affection. They're loyalty, their devotion to people to get them to do whatever they want them to do. They're fighting for that person. They're fighting for that relationship. And that's what showed through in Lucas, this tremendous, loyalty, love, affection, sweetness. He was an unbelievably sweet dog. His scarred face just made it all the more poignant and sad, like an old boxer. DR. FRANK MCMILLAN: Merill was the one that we actually saw something from. She didn't bite anybody, but she made the effort. At least it showed us that she had that in her if she was put under any kind of threatening situations. TIERNEY SAIN: Merill was court ordered to stay here for the rest of her life, so she'll be here forever. She has an awesome life. She's a joy to come into every day because she has the best smile. And she's always happy. And she's always ready to love on you. TAZ CHRISTENSEN: We actually sometimes call her momma Merrill because she teaches other dogs appropriate dog behavior. She's just an absolute love and a pleasure to be around every day. PAUL LINDLEY: Come on, Denzel. For the most part, they were frightened. They were unsocialized. They needed help and they needed training. But they were so responsive to the kindness, and care, and love, and affection that they came out of this as heroes. Yeah, oh, I know. I know. I've had Little for 2 and 1/2 years now. Little enjoys her life very much. She has a companion in Jewels, another pit bull that I adopted. They love to play. Little is shy. And she's nervous about people until she understands that they won't hurt her. Jewels thinks no one will ever hurt her. She is just a sunny, sunny dog. And it's been really good for Little. It's helped Little to be more unguarded with her affection. Little has overcome so many of her fears. Come on, Littles. Let's go, babies. She was terrified to walk through the door. Now she does it effortlessly. She knows that she's not going somewhere where she will be hurt. It's a safe place. The common kind of parlance of people who talk about fight dogs is, well, you can never really rehabilitate them. Yeah, you're just shining. You're just shining. She did not have to be rehabilitated. She needed to recover. Yeah, my sweet pea. My little sweet pea. FRANCIS BATTISTA: The Michael Vick dogs changed forever the way people regard dogs taken from fight rings. Now, rather than it being standard procedure for these animals simple to be killed, these dogs really broke ground. And, really, they are the champions of this whole story. Their legacy is that animals are individuals. Dogs are individuals. These dogs should be treated as individuals and given a chance. It would have been nice if it never happened, but it did happen. And these dogs have been such tremendous ambassadors for their breed. We've been talking with John Garcia. He's an amazing dog trained from Best Friends Animal Society. A few years after this case, there was a large multi state dog bust... eight states, 29 crime scenes. Unlike previous busts, because of what happened in the Michael Vick case, not all of them, but some of them were able to go out to rescue organizations. In April 2008, the Human Society of the United States changed their policies on the treatment of dogs on fighting property. Now the Humane Society of the United States is a rescue partner of ours. Sit. Good girl. They just delivered seven dogs from a huge dog fighting case, which was wonderful. PETA, to this day, is staying the course. They still believe all those dogs should have been destroyed, and all future ones should be destroyed. They've been programmed to kill other animals, period. They can't even be housed in the same kennel at the shelter. TIM RACER: You know, people want to say, oh, these are fighting dogs. And I want to say, no, these are family dogs. Just because somebody else wanted to do a despicable thing with these animals does not make them a fighting dog. And when you give them food and water, shelter, basic training, like any dog should have, then there you've got a family dog. DONNA REYNOLDS: Our adopters don't call them the Vick dogs anymore. For Johnny, now, he's Cris' dog. He's their family dog. Johnny is just a funny, lovable little guy. He is what he was meant to be when he was born into the world as a pup. They, I think, taught us even more than we thought we knew. They said, come on, let's get on with life. We can do this. For a large percentage of the dogs in this case, they actually are more than just family members. They are therapy dogs. They are agility dogs. They're, essentially, doing more than the average dog in society does. Working with charity and the other Vick dogs reminded me why I do this kind of work. Sometimes it is really challenging, sometimes it's overwhelming. It wasn't easy. I mean, we worked around the clock. Oh, are you giving me a grin? What a good girl. It could be stressful at times. It can be heartbreaking at times, but it's so worth it. It matters. It matters to that dog. And it matters to other dogs. I didn't realize how big of an impact it would be on so many people and other animals. FRANCIS BATTISTA: When we started the sanctuary, our vision of things, our aspiration, our North Star was kindness, kindness to animals, kindness to each other. There's an artificial distance between ourselves and the animals. We pride ourselves and give ourselves a special place because we make all of these things, and we talk, and we write, and all that sort of stuff. But when you get to know the animals, you see the richness of their lives, the depth of they're feeling and their intelligence, the grounding that they provide for us, the length that they give us to nature. It's not that they are distant at all. These are our brother and sister creatures. The lives of all of these animals have intrinsic value. They're not ours to dispose of or to discard. There is no small life or insignificant life that doesn't matter. If Best friends stands for anything, it's a testament to following that dream and doing what you know to be the right thing to do. You know, you may not change the world, but you'll certainly have a good time trying. SUSAN WEIDEL: Micheal Vick tried to make these dogs mean, particularly Little Red. And he was not successful. She's never been a mean dog. She's a dog who was traumatized. There's nothing in the world that she did to deserve the cruel treatment she had. I've seen the adjustments she's made, and it's taken her time. But she deserved that time. Sometimes I see when she's sleeping that she's dreaming. And her dreams aren't always good dreams. There are times when I can tell she's distressed. And when that happens, I wake up and bring her back to reality. Just reassure her that she's safe, that she never has to be afraid again. No one will ever, ever hurt this dog ever again. And I think she believes that now. I want her to have the best life possible. I want her days to be filled with the things that make her happy. And I think that they are. She loves her home. She loves her life. Let's go, Littles. This is where she was meant to be. She knows that she's home. (MUSIC PLAYING)
