The Cat has Nine Lives Why did you come? A cow pissing in a tub is ribbusting but also disgusting So... ls that bad? Tell me... What should I tell you? I don't know. About your work. My work... Successful, stress, but that belongs together. Stefan? Someone told his wife about his cheating on her. I can't tell Katharina that I'm divorced as of yesterday. Divorce or honesty is out of the question. It makes things worse. Stefan is not the first man... with these problems. No. I don't want any solution. I'm tired. France is tired, she said. Beauty always makes me sad. Pretty here... Would you close it? No, leave it open. I could use some help. No Go ahead, up here. I'm tired. Where's the furniture? The furniture is still on the way. No furniture, I'm tired, I wanted to take a nap. Without further ado. This is a French bed. Are you coming? Coming. Oh shit... she said. Lovely - oh how lovely. That's nice. Real French. Black and White. Tired? Yes. Going to enjoy an hour's... Oh, here you can have... Oh, you have it Anne, wake up. No, I don't want to. That's tragic, right? Do you... really love him? Would you marry him? I can't talk about it. Divorce is no solution, neither is marriage. "H" - Haaa - H-o-l-y As in Holy Saint George! Try again. You can say it. Of course you can. Long live the horse. - Cheers- Thanks for the horse. Thank you. Why not? Let's drink to a horse. I never before toasted to a horse. It's lovely here. It's lovely here. Take a look at that. Beauty always makes me sad. When I died last time... For some people life is easy, for others it's hard. For you life is heavy, so you said. One could take everything much easier. No need to be extreme... and still do what you do, whole heartedly. Do you love Katharina or not? Yes Right? - Yes, of course- Why don't you speak up? I also love my wife. You can't do that! I love Katharina and I also love my wife. And you love Gabriele, Circe and may be, me too. May be, you too. Stop spoiling the evening. Let me talk to Stefan. Go on, it's very interesting. Right Stefan? Tell me, maybe, me too. Yes, maybe you too. It's too easy. I have another suggestion. I have one. What, tell me I have one Tell me No. You tell yours first. Tell yours first. Yours first Go We could take a good long walk to the Isar. No! That's stupid No? Well then, tell yours. Milk? Papa, had you been listening? What do you mean. What was I talking about? I don't remember What was I talking about? Don't be cheeky. ...That I can expect 1500 marks to start with, and provided I do the job properly and that I suit you I'd like a raise to 1700 marks. Not wanting to be a cheeseparer, I agree to a starting salary of 1500 a month. And if you are as good a head secretary as you hope I think we can meet your otherwishes too. Your last job was as a freelance journalist. Nobody gave you orders. I'd like to know why you are leaving a profession, which I imagine to be very interesting to go in for something which requires regular hours and office humdrum. I'd rather not go into why I want to quit freelance journalism. Let's just assume I'm not making much headway at present You'll start... if you let me know you are willing, and I'd like you to let me know soon, you can start work on the first of the month after next I wanted to try it out. What? See if I could get that job just like that. Just for personal self-assurance, to boost my ego Just for being charming? I'm pretty sure. I think it's mainly due to the impression you made. No way of really knowing what I am capable of. This first impression does it. I felt very appreciated, getting that job right off. Him saying, I am choosing YOU and agreeing to the pay I asked for. I can't concentrate seeing you like that. Bosh, she said. Better? The world could be restored, if I sat there. That's an idea. His rightous place. There's nothing we can do, our eroticism is patriarchal Somehow I think I need some re-inforcement. You're too overpowering. You women. That's quite evident. Why did you say I should be sensible? What does being sensible mean? Just sensible. That you consider what you want and then acting accordingly. Not skipping the line, staying on course. But to stay on course one has to be sure. Sure. But the choice can be easier by sticking to a line beforehand, if possible. Now the problem is how to act. You can't act any old way, Some things are mutually exclusive Because you are incapable of acting any old way I should be too I do what I like. Not with me. Then I won't do anything with you And not with my friends. Just because I smile at you today and give you a flower do I have to do it every day? Of course. You're crazy. I don't want to. That's what makes is treason. You are crazy. There is no other way. A medieval way. I expect a person to keep to the style initially shown to me, voluntarily. I have my own psychology, definite functions of the feeling, definite devotions determined in childhood. No playing around as you please I won't be pinned down. Nothing is ever final. Tomorrow is another day Why should I be responsible tomorrow for this walk? You're responsible anyway. You treat me like a capitalist because I like you, and that's it. Capitalism isn't only politics. What's your idea of me? Because your vanity is hurt. You think I am not searching. That's not searching. Circling around is not searching. May be I can only live in a circle. Why does that bother you? Yes, but how much longer? So what? That's my problem. You simply state that I couldn't live in this atmosphere. You won't even allow that I need a certain atmosphere because it's not yours. That is fascism. You won't let me be myself. Why? In the long run it's not viable. Not for you, but for me. For most people it isn't. I am not most people. I have to live the way I am. Try not to hurt your friends. I don't hurt you more than you hurt me. You think it's always the others. You hurt other people too. But why do we hurt each other? You know everything You ought to know, tell me why. I don't want to dace with Sascha anymore. It makes me sick. You go. Don't go away. Do you love me? How's it going? What? How's it going? Awful. There he is. We'll go and plant them. Long live liberty. I am Prometheus. Now fire. Lovely and warm. Now some vodka. Take a seat. Where are your Russian records? Wait a minute, vodka first. What's this little thing? A grass A type of grass growing on the Polish-Russian border. It's called Zubrowska. The vodka's called that too. And then... Say "long live France" Pardon? "Nastrovje" "nastrovje" Now the record you asked for Is that genuine? Sure. The record and the vodka What a flavour That's a synchronisation Careful, all automatic Shall we dance? That's a real small vodka You're not fair. You're playing a game with Sascha. Alright. No games. There you are at last. I dreamt of you. Let me sit beside you. I'll be very quiet. Tell me. What is it? I'll tell you everything. Do you love me? I love you more than myself, I love you so much, more than words can tell. My love, may I ask you, do you love me? I think I do, but I am not sure. Am I beautiful? I don't want to look at you. I want you to come. I'm always supposed to say you are beautiful. I can hardly look at you, you are so beautiful. Am I beautiful? Don't you love me? I don't know yet I'll wait for you Here I am And now? Please don't Don't you want to? Perhaps Always perhaps I don't know. What are you doing here like a heap of misery? You wanted me to do what I did. Here take the stuff and put everything in the car. Get up! What's wrong? I've lost my ear-rings. Go and find them. Go. Stop making such a face. I have a splitting headache Haven't you? Yes, I have. And a fungus Like some? Later Why did you accept my declaration of war last night? I wasn't prepared to make war against you. It wasn't a war. But it became one. Whenever I see your face I immediately feel like I want to hurt you. You shouldn't show your weak spot. I think one should to the one you love it is the only way to find out if you are loved. You have to be able to surrender yourself. Bye now. Be good. Don't make too much of a mess Bye honey, I'll call you. Why should a machine that flies need to drive formiles first? I think it's a very human problem. No more noise blanket above towns, no more runways. No more disturbance by airplane noise. No more need to distroy forests to build airports No need to cover nature in a flood of concrete. Actually, it's a sort of developmental defect. You invest money not knowing you can finance further. Do you realize the conclusions you should draw from all that? What conclusions? Don't you have to face alternatives? For example to go to America rather, than face a political fight here. I can't understand, if a state invests that much money why not finishing the project? Why let it fall apart, and then emigrate... Better planning is needed for sure. Giving here, stopping there, going on again... clarification about the meaning of subsidies... You can't just go away. I don't understand. If you are really interested in Gabriele, why not write for magazines? Gabriele is interesting as a person. I think other topics are more interesting. Sure. Right now it's she keeping me busy. What do you want to know? Who do you like singing for and what are your favorit songs? Chansons? Pop? It depends, if it's commercially successful, And then the public will like it. My young composers love my voice, finally... I found fullfilement. That means a lot for me, of course. Professional fullfilment is happiness for you? ...is privat fullfilment as well. Are you not married due to your profession? I can't fit in a 100% with another person and that's what living together requires. My profession is everything for me. Even trying to be with someone is nerve-racking, then it busts out, we quarrel, and all... I pay the price. Being angry makes you ugly, being ugly you can't work, go broke, be unhappy. Laughing is important. Not being serious all the time. Look at those pictures: What a grave beauty. I'm never supposed to laugh... well, because of the dog. One can't always be serious. I like friends I can fool around with, laugh with, go dancing, tell jokes, like... Oh, I know a couple good ones One really can't always be serious. Right. Nothing but all that marvelous talk. Tell me... What kind of man could you fall for? An extraordinary one. He must be extraordinary... don't laugh... I've always thought... if Jesus had loved women, I'd have liked to love him. Strange, isn't it? Are you beautiful? I hate that question. Of course not. I am not beautiful, absolutely not. Oh, I don't know So, no comment. Funny, all the complements I get, people saying, how beautiful she is. Specifically, how do you affect women? Women hate me right off. Almost always. It's usually hate at first sight. Then, when they see I am different, laugh and act natural, they like me. So glad you made it. A drink first, or work? Straight to work. Like something? Not just now. You are a writer? I have my... Two possibilities, either we stress the rhythm, like this, or the average listener might find it easier, going commercial, something like this. Like that. It sinks in right away. Whatever. As a musician I prefer the other. I'll come back to it later. To emphasize is essential: The cat has NINE lives. What about the cat has nine LIVES, people only one. The cat has NINE Lives. How does that sound? Can I join in? Yes, join in. The end is essential: "not getting annoyed..." Pause... "even if fire breaks out" you'll get the point over through the pause. Exactly. "...but when they caress me..." "I'm the worlds sweetest, most charming creature". "...Enjoy, enjoy every moment, "...not getting annoyed, even if fire breaks out." It sounds a bit like cabaret. Must we enjoy? We must enjoy, enjoy every moment. To enjoy is not being hectic, that could easily be drawn out. Oh, it's a bit too low. - Too low? I'll have to think about it. Here it needs a bridge, and I'm not sure about... Hey, I have an idea, what if we just use drums. Not bad. I wasn't intending much melody anyway. The rhythm must go on with your accompaniment. Sly and sexy... I was thinking... not tragically, sly and sexy. It's better... Please! Okay "she doesn't get worked up and snarl..." "and when her tomcat slinks to other cats..." "she doesn't get worked up and snarl." "I too I am a cat, I spit and I scratch to have my way. "But when they caress me, spoil me, flatter me, "I am the worlds sweetest, most charming creature." She's a star already. We're getting where we didn't want to go, a star is made, We cook something up and then sell it hot. For 3 weeks, 3 months she's a star, then she's dropped. That's why I wonder, if we should do this story. I told her she's got a hit, Now I've got to know her as a person. She told me all sorts of things, trusting me, now I feel like a traitor. Like having abused her confidence. She may have her doubts about me. But we'll do that article... well, if you... How are you going to tackle the story. I don't quite see... A pop comedy, the love they sing of... ...the love of dance etc... teens in rebellion against tradition and the establishment... I still don't quite see it. Half historical summary, half star sociology, half tear-jerker. As soon as we do this, well, we're helping this stuff to succes. I always aproach things through my feelings. I haven't got the manual skills, the scientific know-how to get something going. Well, maybe you haven't got your confidence from studying things, but rather from the human angles, for instance from marriage, it doesn't have to be a formal marriage, but maybe a relation that gives you security, a certain help? Perhaps. What do you mean by insisting that I need a partner? What is it you are saying? I thought I was plain enough? Just fill in the person's names, it doesn't have to be a... like I said... whether it's called marriage is of secondary importance, I wouldn't mind marrying you, but not necessarily, there are a bunch of other possibilities. I am quite sure to resolve your problems this way. What if I don't love you? Assumed, we knew what it means, to be in love at the age of 30. Teenagers might know what it means for sure, but even they get over it. As long as I try to change things, by pitching in with all my energy to find something new, you never know what it might be, I cannot make this decision, I have to say "no". What do you do? What do you mean? You must do something. Yes, I know, but... come. I am not interested in any kind of career. I am not playing the game. I'd sooner croak. I'm working only I work enough to pay my phone and the rent for my flat. But for nothing more I can do something different every day. "I too am a cat, I spit and I scratch, if things don't go my way. But when they caressing, spoiling and flattering me... Those are the two things... Yes, that's it! I hope I get it. Come listen. One more time? Listen first. Let's go listen. More input on "sweetest". It'd be too quick. You can do it. Speak slower So all the students at once went on strike of course, perfectly normal... That isn't a game forme. Now I am always scared. In Paris I got a - what do you call it? - a bruise on my head, and now I am scared. There are things one must do. Right? What's your name? Marianne. Are you a student? No. Why? Most of them are students, or at least were once. What difference does it make? Why are you demonstrating in Germany? Being here I join the demonstration. Isn't it quite normal? Sure, it's normal but... Do you know what it is about? Sure. To create a world revolution. Usually, you can't remember that far back, but I know I have memories of a dark room, a red comforter on a bed without sheets, I could draw it. In there I started to examine myself, to play with myself. One of the grown-ups came in, dragging me out, beating me... That's probably what caused me to see and do these things without inhibitions only much later. ...and... I'd probably realized much sooner that auto-eroticism makes you more independent of your partner. I'd call that the other extreme. A child that is told it can masturbate freely, I would say the damage done is as great as... the confusion that it causes is as great as the effect of repressive upbringing. If these things are totally integrated into life and children are taught that way, the chances of happiness are greater. Freer and happier. Now a real horse 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 - now guess, Katharina. I don't know. Give a number. Four Look Lovely Another one? - 7 - All Saint George. I love the horse. What about Circe? Circe is a wonderful, strange women. Can you introduce me to your Circe? No. Not yet. She is travelling. She has lots of money. Is she married? No. Sometimes. Nobody knows. She's a nymphomaniac, a mythomaniac, a cleptomaniac, she does whatever she likes. She can even blow up the Eiffel Tower, if she wants to. She is a real woman. This is a surprise. Come in. What are you up to? Keeping busy. Working. I worked on a story all night long. Like to hear it? It's a childhood memory. On our farm we used to play "ride the pig" Sometimes we just grabbed the tail. Staying on longest was winning. Sometimes I only got real dirty. I imagined Katharina protecting lovers. Is Katharine altruistic? The Indians do what they have learnt. We do what we have learnt. Few people can do more than what they have learnt. We can only imagine what already exists. Not-marriage does not exist. Nor does an alternative to marriage. What business do you have with Katharina? None. We are friends. But Stefan and Katharina came to see you? Yes. I was sick. But what did you do? Katharina brought me a bunch of irises. And Stefan sat at my bedside. And then? What, and then? I want to know more. What do you want from Stefan? We have lots of fun together. Stefan ought to dream that all women have vaginas on their foreheads, then he could run round the world, going bang, bang, bang... In my fathers garden the Duke of Marlborough lies dead If he were a poor man, nobody would loose sleep over it. But now the Beauty stands at the window, bewailing his fate. I want to die. Like the thread from the reel time is unwound keeps my love and my sorrow You promised to be true forevermore Vengeance is sure to come, do not leave me, my love. Like the thread from the reel, time is unwound, keeps my love and my sorrow. That was a decision. "Gabriele is the mirror of society"...too pathetique. What is it, that makes "a star"? What have you found out? And I have been thinking about you. You are an Electra. A bird. Stupid creature. And now? What's wrong now? I want an apple. Now! Buy me an apple. Is that enough? Take me for a walk. Anything else? I am so sad. A plane. I know another Manfred. "Yes", she said, and threw him out of the window. I am so sad. Do you love me? Yes or no? You are always sad. You know... it's a long story. Having been waiting so long for a women like Anne, when the time finally comes, you are only very tired. Close your eyes. Quick. Your eyes closed? Look. For me? - Yes for you. Your precious stone and a heart. His face is a bit crooked. His hair starts lower on the left. When he turns up his collar he looks like Chopin. I can define happiness only negatively. I have to visualize the results of a decision to know what I don't want. True. But in reference to marriage, I can define it only positively. I am not supposed to see it negativly. Perhaps... though we should be careful of, is a reformation of happiness, a false love of beginnings. END
