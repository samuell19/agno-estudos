I was not an actress. When it came to movies, I was a dancer. I didn't have any way for them to know whether I could really act. But they realized there was enough there for them as a human being, to draw out. And I'm grateful because I suppose the way I am is what has brought me so much good fortune, you know? From the Motion Picture Capital of the world, the Academy of Motion Picture arts and sciences, 26th annual Academy awards. And now, over to you live in Los Angeles. Should I read it? Should I read it? I don't think I will. Ladies and gentlemen in New York city, Miss. Audrey Hepburn in Roman Holiday. It's too much. I want to say thank you to everybody who in these past months and years have helped, guided and given me so much. I'm truly, truly grateful. I'm terribly happy. Today the name of Audrey Hepburn flashes from theater marquees. From the covers of national magazines, from column upon column of newspaper rave notices. For everybody is talking about her sensational star debut in Paramount's Roman Holiday. Audrey Hepburn was not like any other actor or actress out there. She just had magnetism. People loved her. She was a newcomer that was so strong and so impressive. You became world famous over one night after having made Roman holiday. I think that many of the girls here would like to be a star like you. Have you any advice to give to them? The only advice I can give is that, they must make sure they want to be it enough because as it's so often said, hard work is never so hard when it is done with love. Audrey's look with something brand new. There were the girl next door types like Doris Day, and then the sex bombs like Marilyn Monroe. There were wonderful female stars at the time, but there was nothing quite like her. She created this type of woman that really didn't exist. That was her. Audrey is an icon for people from all over the world. Her image, her style and the way of life. That's her great beauty. People love her and know her because of her lovely face or her smile. But there was a real Audrey that people don't know. She's not only an icon on print. Audrey's life was so much more than that. There's a lovely phrase in Arthur Rubinstein's book. Many years ago, when he had a very, very difficult beginning to his life. He had to decide whether to reject life or to love it. And he said, I just decided to love it unconditionally. And I believe that. Audrey's parents met in the Dutch Indies. Audrey's father was a diplomat. And Audrey's mother, the Baroness at Heemstra was there because her father was a governor. Audrey Hepburn never mentioned it really, but in her family, there was this Dutch nobility. My grandfather, Joseph Ruston Hepburn was an aspiring aristocrat. There's a typical twenties formal portrait shot of him. Showing him just as he was. Always very well groomed a small moustache, slick black hair and nice suit. He was an aspiring aristocrat whose background was very fuzzy. He made up some sort of lineage that would have made him a distant heir of The King of scotland. He thought highly of himself and nothing really materialized. When they lived in the Dutch Indies, he felt that Marxists, communists were going to take over. So they moved back to Belgium. And that's when my mother was born in 1929. Audrey's father quickly embraced the Belgium fascist party, the rexist. And he was also vehemently anti-semitic. Audrey's parents went to Nazi Germany, and cheered on the marches. They were very impressed by the rejuvenation of the German nation, under Nazi rule. And Audrey's mother, even penned a few articles for magazines really praising the Nazi regime. That was 1935, which is exactly when Audrey's father abandoned his family and moved to England where he became an active member of the black shirts. The British fascist party. When the war broke out, she was in a boarding school in the UK. Not that far away from London, where her father lived. He did have visitation rights, which he never used. And so she was by herself, and other children on weekends were seeing their parents and she ended up spending her summers with workers that her mother found. Her mother felt that it would be safer for her to be in the Netherlands because they thought that England might be carpet bombed. Her father actually took her to the airport. This is the last time that she saw him. So that was September of 1939. She flew on the last plane that left the UK and then into Amsterdam. She changed her name, her first name. She was Adar. And not Audrey, in order to not arouse suspicion that she might be English. I was 10 when the war broke out. This was in September and in May the Germans marched in to Holland. The first few months, we didn't know quite what had happened. Had we known the first six months of the war that we were going to be occupied for five years, we might have all shot ourselves. We thought it'll be over next week. Holland was one of the worst because we were occupied by the SS. Not by just the military. Everybody sort of just clammed up and went underground and you couldn't speak freely. And you weren't allowed to listen to radios and we grew up that way. Knowing that we were all prisoners. There came a moment when we had to live in the cellar because parts of our house kept being shot away. We were sleeping on mattresses and sitting there waiting for the shooting to stop. My uncles were taken from their homes and shot. One brother was sent to Germany. The other one was always hidden. My uncles were the first hostages to be shot in Holland. And it was actually the turning point because from that day on an underground was formed. She was asked to take messages for the resistance in her shoes. And it was the city telegram at the time, the safest on a bike, put a kid on the bike, put a message in the insole of their shoes and it's quick and nobody's gonna stop kids. She performed for the Dutch resistance, not just to raise monies, but also to entertain people and get their minds off the horrors that they were living through. Ever since I was a little girl in Holland I wanted to be a ballet dancer. That was my dream. As a child already. Ballet, ballet, ballet is what I love most. They would do plays and little musical operettas and trying to stay discrete and not bring the attention of the invading soldiers. At the end of the performances, nobody clapped their hands. They just smile in the dark. Dancing was the lifeline throughout the war. It helped to keep her from looking at where she was. There's that sense of dance as a way to take flight. Dance was a way for her to escape. I was terribly slim during the war because little by little, there was practically nothing to eat. All children started to suffer from malnutrition. No provisions made, with no food in the shops. And that last winter, I mean, nothing grows in the winter. You can keep carrots and potatoes. for just so long and some turnips but we were running out of those. And that was really very, very hard. She survived the Dutch famine on bread made of tulips. And when they liberated her, she was living in her basement in the Netherlands and the first UNICEF agents that had been assembled to provide aid to women and children after the war, they literally pulled her out of the famine. She would always talk about how they arrived and they handed her chocolate bar. And like that was her turning point. When we were liberated. It was so exciting and that's when life started again. All the things you've never had, never seen, never eaten and never worn started to come back again. That was such a stimulus. As soon as I could, I wanted desperately to become a dancer and I got a scholarship in the Rambert ballet school in London. I didn't have a dime and she took me in, I lived in her house in a room and ate meals in her kitchen when she was out on tour with her company. And I had months and months of training in her school. But because of the war and interruption and malnutrition, now I didn't get a really solid couple of years of training until I went to the Rambert school. It was late and I didn't have anywhere near the technique that girls my age had. She talked to Marie Rambert and Marie said, all of those complications are gonna add up to taking away some percentage of chance of you to become a prima ballerina. And of course she was devastated. But she had no choice to sort of cry over herself. She had to keep moving. I had no money, and I had to get job and I did get one for the musicals. I plunged into show business in London. It was the best cure. I was in a chorus, in a big chorus room with all the other girls rehearsing and dancing and doing twice nightly's and from then on, That was my life. Who wants a ciggy? - Hello sweetie? - I was a dancer and that's really what I wanted to do always. I never wanted to become an actress or never dared to think in those terms. Ooh really Alfred. I became an actress because I have to earn a living. And I started doing little bits in movies, to get the extra buck. I watched every move you make. I was in the South of France doing a French movie Monte-Carlo baby. And by chance, we were doing a scene in the hotel De Paris And she was there with her husband. And she said, in very few words, would I like to play Gigi on Broadway. final curtain on the big new hit, Gigi. And Audrey Hepburn, the young continental beauty who's Broadway's latest star takes... It was my break, but I have two very big breaks in the same month. William Wyler came to England looking for an unknown. He really ordered a lot of tests made and I was one of them. And that's the test that won me the part and started a lovely career for me. I was 12 years old when I saw Roman holiday. And it was a revelation. I was a tomboy as were most of my friends resisting the transition to lady-hood. And you know all the... Nowadays I guess then too, all these girls wanted to be princesses. I never wanted to be a princess. So that was Audrey Hepburn, sort of abdicating her princess-ship. And it was just so exciting. Gregory Peck and Audrey Herpburn were a kind of unbeatable combination. She's an Explorer, she's an adventurer. She cuts her hair, which is already a huge emancipation. She gets rid of the heavy burden of the crown and the hair. She's on the back of a motorcycle with Gregory Peck. And it's just the ultimate expression of self willed liberation. She's active. She's not waiting for the guy to come. She goes back and forth from ugly duckling to Swan and from Swan to ugly duckling. So these are the sort of fairytale roles that she plays and incarnates just magnificently. I'm going to that corner there and turn. You must stay in the car and drive away. She really hadn't been training as an actress but she'd been training to perform. She had to draw on her own sad and difficult real life experiences. So that we feel closer to her, more familiar. Out of nowhere, this star was born in that movie. When something like that happens to you, with all the paraphernalia that comes with it. Everybody wanted to interview you and I was working and burning the candle at both ends. I was so new to it all. I said yes to everything and I was in a play and doing interviews and television. It was only four years before that come out of Holland and a long German occupation where we hadn't been able to keep up at all with pictures. And I was way behind. And there's so much I wasn't aware of. So let alone think of me or future, or I didn't know it was going to lead even to another movie. I received this extraordinary Oscar, so early. And I really didn't know what hit me. Once I did Roman Holiday, the offers came in from Willy Wyler again, from Fred Zimmermann, from Billy Wilder. Audrey was probably one of the last movie stars from the golden age of Hollywood. What you got with all of those movies stars at that period. They were very much like the characters that they played. That was the point. She was given birth to her stardom by the studio system, that sort of the last great moment of classical cinema. Audrey was under contract in the 50's and the 60's when she did a number of pictures at Fort paramount, including "War and Peace" and "Sabrina" which was her first picture with Wilder. The very first day she came on the set, she was prepared. She knew her lines. I did not have to squeeze it out of her. Everybody fell in love with her. I included. She wasn't a Hollywood bombshell that I think so much of the actresses around that time were. And suddenly she came and she was like a lion, her beautiful, big almond eyes, her black Raven hair. And I think for Hubert, that was something actually he really worked towards was accentuating the fact that she had this incredible graceful line in her body. That was not typical of what was out there at that point. And in a way it became quite ground breaking. Hubert and Audrey met in this very room that we're in. This is the grand salon. Hubert thought he was meeting Catherine Hepburn. And so it was a really surprising visit for him because he was totally taken aback. He said, but you're not not who I expected. And here was this absolute petite, fragile, very beautiful, very fine featured little curteous girl. And I think he was not completely enthralled at the beginning. But then she came and she told him she wanted him to do the costumes for her film Sabrina. He was very reluctant, but over dinner, she sort of charmed him and convinced him. And the next day they started collaborating for that film. And it became a love affair. I think between the two of them. I went away. Fashion came into my life when I had my very, very first haute couture dress made by Hubert de Givenchy for a picture called Sabirna And I must say I wasn't disappointed. The beauty of it was extraordinary and the way it was made. And I've always had a love for pretty things, pretty clothes. I think what Hubert loved about Audrey was she was almost like the girl next door She was quite sophisticated actually. I think she was quite well read. She was a dancer. She knew how to move. They completely understood each other. In so many ways I think it was a complete surprise to him to, to dress someone like her. She's incredibly petite, tiny, tiny frame, but somehow he made her through the clothes through the line that he drew on her body it just looks statuesque. Hubert and I are very much alike. We love the same things, and we're hurt by the same things. I think we're both sensitive. There's a wonderful French word, dépouille, which means without ornament. With everything stripped away. There's a purity about his clothes, but always with a sense of humor. Hurbert would do something terribly simple. But there'll be just that one little bow or little rose or something that will give it a little, as I say, a sense of humor, a little fun. Audrey and Givenchy invented a style. Audrey's style. When an artist meets another artist, the best things come out and they were like that. When you actually see still shots of her, she knows how to hold herself in the clothes. And I think she was showing her personality through the clothes and the fact that they had this incredible connection made that so much more unique, particularly at that time, because I think it was a very rare thing. There were almost no Hollywood actresses that had this intimate relationship with a designer back in the 50s'. And so they really pioneered something. My greatest anguish was always, who would I be good enough in the scene? Would I be able to do the job? I would dress but to do a good job and to know the scene well, and if the director afterwards said Print it. That was lovely Audrey. That's all I wanted. That she was called an artist of love. I think it's totally fitting. She was learning love firsthand. I think part of it is she had lacked love as a child. Her mother was harsh and uncomplimentary. She made her feel ugly. I think. So there was that complex she had. And yet it didn't embitter her or sidetrack her, or make her defensive. Instead, she kept opening up. And Sabrina of course, she's just young and passionate that she's a teenager and teenagers are always going to die for love. But she really is. She really sets about it. She's the one who admits love. It's like she's brave enough to risk rejection and open her heart before the man does. And it's because the men are cynical. Or they don't believe in love. And she's the one that kind of awakens them. David, would you like to kiss me? - Would I? - Yes. A nice steady kiss. She was clearly seeking love everywhere she went in all of her films and in her life too, I think. Hello, I am Audrey Hepburn. Ondine is a very beautiful love story in which Mel Ferrer and I appear together. Mel plays the Knight errant and I play a water sprite and it's a very gay part. Greg peck and my father were best friends. And when Greg comes back from Rome, he says you have to meet this girl. I just did this film with. And they meet and the rest is history. I think they found each other and they adored each other. And were very happy. They were both very lovable people. My father was a brilliant educator, spoke five languages, had also a semi European background. And they were very similar in many ways. They were both very strong people. They consulted with each other on everything and he collaborated with her and this is what they talked about over dinner. What do you think of the script? This is what I'm thinking. for this next outfit for this next movie. This is the camera man. What about the music? How do you feel about this and that? Mel was a good actor. And he attached himself to projects and got them made because he was a producer in his own right. He was really a kind and caring person. And he loved her deeply. They were pretty business smart in terms of how her brand needed to be or the kind of career choices that she needed to make. There were scenes in funny face that I remember. I loved doing because they went to music and having originally been a dancer not a good one, but I was a dancer and I love all the musical numbers. I was Very apprehensive about doing that pitch. I do remember the first time I met Fred Astaire and that was on set. I knew how good I should be to dance with Fred Astaire. I knew I wasn't. I had a very slender kind of technique and I wasn't a great technician at all. And to be cast opposite him was terribly exciting, but I was very apprehensive. In many of her roles. She could come across as a frivolous girl, but she really finds the sort of gravity in those roles. In Funny face the away she dances and she completely deconstructs what dance is about. This is the lightness that she brings. All right, go. Move, move She obviously was gifted on so many levels. Her incredible abilities to perform for the camera, be a princess or a librarian and becoming a supermodel. My grandfather was Richard Avedon and funny face was loosely based on his first marriage to Doe Avedon. My grandfather was photographing those who perform with their emotions. Audrey was the ultimate beauty, both internally and externally. She was obviously such a gift to the camera that he was astonished. And when you look at the photographs my grandfather took of Audrey, I think you'd definitely get a sense of what kind of person she was. And perhaps that's why she was this devastating gift because she gave so much, and there was so much range, whether that be in a stream of sorrow and romance and desire, or just absolutely elated with wonder, She loved Richard Avedon because she and Avedon were on the same wavelength. So he didn't have to tell her what to do. She knew what to do. She was made of so many different dimensions and experiences in life from the suffering she endured to the joy she's still experienced in life and the artistry she maintained. If you actually go through the archive and you look at what has been the most important dresses that people recognize so much of it is the work Hubert did with her. The dress from Funny face was one of the most iconic fashion movie moments of that era. He created something so timeless, but so Iconic. And if I actually think back to myself, when I first saw Audrey Hepburn movies, I fell in love with her and the way she looked in those movies. And of course the breakfast at Tiffany's dress is one of the most iconic dresses of all time. That moment, when she steps out of the taxi at the beginning of the film, she's got every symbol of Paris with her in a way. She has a croissant in her hand, pearls her hair in an up do, And this incredible black silhouette, just so refined and so elegant. It became a symbol of the ultimate black dress. And she became an icon from that. Everyone is now thinking no one had any singularity or eccentricity or individuality, bullshit. Was there anyone who had more of that than Audrey Hepburn. I don't even wanna own anything until I can find a place where me and things go together. It was a real performance. She captured that kind of crazy, the sane girl that Truman Capote wrote about. She personified it very brilliantly and she wasn't really like that. But she nailed it. It's one of her best performances. In fact, I think it's the most iconic photo of her. It still is Holly Golightly. It seems to be used most often to define her. What sort of a girl is she? She is a, what they call in America these days a kook. How does that mean? It's spelt with a k I believe. Which is a dizzy gay type of girl. Anything like you? I'm not quite that way. No. Truman Capote actually thought that she was too elegant. And he wanted someone who looked like they could be a woman of the night and not someone who was elegant and graceful and truly stood out as the class in the room. As opposed to the arm piece. She takes a story which is meant for Marilyn Monroe and elevates it out of the typecasting and transforms that part into what it became. She really also like gave this Holly Golightly character, completely different texture. She was a call girl like basically. Any gentleman with the slightest cheek will give a girl a $50 bill for the powder room. And Audrey gave her this depth. I'm not Holly. I'm not Lula mae either I don't know who I am. I'm like cat here. We're a couple of no name slabs. We belong to nobody, and nobody belongs to us. We don't even belong to each other. Moon River was perfect song written for Audrey Hepburn. ♪ Waiting round the bend ♪ She sang very beautifully, but she did not have a large range. It has this melancholic feeling to it. But it's hopeful at the end of the rainbow, you're going to get there. After the screening, they're sitting with the studio head and one of them says, Oh, and by the way, that bloody song Moon River has to go. And she jumped out of the chair and said over my dead body, because she knew that that song had legs and she could feel and she know what she's invested into the performance. This is what went down in history as one of the most famous moment of breakfast at Tiffany's. So she had a sense of what was important what wasn't maybe a greater sense than some producers. She was a lioness. She was not handed this. She's been described as the iron fist and the velvet glove. And you have to understand she came from that strong Victorian background. Then the ballet, all those years of training, it's arduous hard, hard physical and mental work. And so she needed that strength and that culture and that background to survive in the world of Hollywood, where you have to fight for everything that you believe in. She had to fight was Givenchy to sublimate the little black dress and take everything that wasn't bolted on off of it, whether it was a bow or whatever, because she understood also the medium and the camera and what it sees and what is necessary. What's not necessary. She wasn't just an actress. She was a movie star. You don't think of her as a complex actress, but there's something deeply complex about her. I love you but I'm not just Lula Mae anymore. In Breakfast at Tiffany's, she was this incredible incandescent figure. She meant so much more than just beautiful, stylish. She meant to curiosity. Did you ever read it? It's absolutely marvelous. Self-determination she's discussed as a fashion icon, but that's a narrow definition of what she is because she exceeds that. She's not like all the stars you felt in some way, she had more freedom. You didn't feel like she was a slave of the studio system at all. That probably more than anything is what makes her great. I think more than almost any star I can think of. And this is saying something that you can't take your eyes off of her when she's in the room. My dream was to become a ballet dancer and it really stayed it for many, many years. I wanted to be a dancer more than anything in the world. But this career has brought me so much happiness and good fortune. It means so much to me. People loved her. Being around her was like traveling with a rock star being nice to you. The first time I met Audrey, I didn't know that she was one the biggest movie stars in the world. She was this really nice lady who came to our house. Audrey, She was so normal. So like any other person, you forget she was a movie star. My son Giovanni was six year old. I remember him asking me mommy, but it's true then Audrey she's a movie star. And I say, yes, she is a movie star and very famous. And he was disappointed he said, why does she not live like a movie star? Why she live like that? Because the way of Audrey living was the most simple you can imagine. The two times that I escorted her at the Oscars, she presented best actor and best picture. And no matter how early we left, we were always late. And just because of traffic and would have to get out walk walk the last two blocks with people in the crowd screaming. That's Audrey Hepburn. At that time, all the late night talk shows would like to book her. And the King of late night was Johnny Carson. Most celebrities were petrified of going on Johnny Carson because he was the King and he could make or break their career. But Johnny Carson was so intimidated by Audrey Hepburn. He could barely talk. What? You think That we should hold hands, while we talk about my husband? She was the only person he was afraid of because she was such a big star. I'm still understanding the level of fame. And it's a unique kind of fame that in my opinion, so few people have achieved and maintained. She had like, obviously the strength of character that was so appealing and you couldn't just help, but fall in love with her. But she also had this incredible vulnerability. The affection that I gained by success, if you like, and by the pictures I made, has always continued and made me very happy. Success is also very much in the eyes of the observer. It's not that I get up every morning and look in the mirror and say, well, what a success I am. It's just me. I'm not your ideal person to be a performer. You can be shy and be a dancer much better than you can be an actress. I've always gone to see my rushes because I've felt I should because I thought maybe there's something I can still correct. And if I've been successful, the audience, the people see something that I don't see. Good afternoon, professor Higgins, are you quite well? What has always helped me a great deal are the clothes. Would you care for some tea? How kind of you to let me come. It was often an enormous help to know that you look the part. How do you do? Walking down those stairs for the first time beautifully dressed in My fair Lady. The rest wasn't so tough anymore. Miss Doolittle You look beautiful. Thank you Colonel Pickering. I'm terribly self conscious about myself and clothes always give me a great deal of self-confidence. Not bad at all. I think she really was insecure and she fought to kind of project a perfectly curated image of herself because of it. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder and this is something I can't see. I see the problems when I get up in the morning to do my best to look well. I would have liked to not have been so tall. I'd like to have had smaller feet. I'd like to have had more figure. I'd like to have a smaller nose. I'd like to been blonde and I'd like to change everything. This is a very interesting moment in her life where she's very fragile in many ways. And it's weeks before the release of my fair lady. And she was accused of stealing the part from Julie Andrews. Cause she had held the part on Broadway. When they shot the movie, it was extremely physically difficult. She took all those singing classes and then she was told that she would be dubbed. ♪ You'll be sorry but your tears will be too light ♪ The studio, worried that her voice compared to Julie Andrews voice would be a step down. Just you wait Henry Higgins, just you wait. So they had Marni Nixon do the singing of the role. Jack Warner made fun of her when she complained about it saying that even the dog Rintintin was dubbed. She felt that for the first time, the press was going to turn on her and that created this anxiety and added insecurity. She felt that something was starting to weigh on her. She was a huge star, but there was this deep wound. My parents divorce when I was six. It certainly stayed with me for the rest of my life. My father leaving us left me insecure, for life perhaps. She adored her father. There's one photo of my mother with her father. The photo is just a candid shot, probably taken by her mother, but you can tell how much she adored him. And then he disappeared one day. My mother explained very sweetly that he'd gone away on a trip. She didn't think he was coming back. I thought my mother was never going to stop crying. She'd sob through the nights, I would hear her sobbing in the next room. And I would just try and be with her. I missed him terribly from the day he disappeared. As a child, you can't quite understand. That sense of helplessness. The strangeness of it too. Not really understanding and just knowing daddy's gone away. That was the first big blow I had as a child. It was one of the traumas that a left very deep mark on me. She really felt throughout her whole life, the lack of her father. And I know that's something that she really struggled with that wasn't really fixed through her amorous relationships at all. There were many difficult times with the partners that she did have. The question of whether Audrey was looking for a father figure in her relations has been discussed. And Mel Ferrer sort of guided her career in the way that's almost print like. She and Mel had a long, fairly happy marriage, but they sort of drifted apart. They were happy and lived the life of Riley for the first decade or longer of their relationship. I have wonderful memories of the two of them, she in a house dress. And he's a very elegant candlelight and then dancing to record player, but they lived and worked together everyday for those 17 years. And my father was a very demanding and difficult man. And I think that also played a role in slowly eroding the relationship. She had a great career, but I think her private life wasn't that lucky. There's a sense that anxiety and the insecurities that she had plenty of actually came from those insolvable questions and the departure. Audrey expressed her desire to see her father to Mel ferrer in 1964, after 25 years of total absence. Curiosity took over. I wanted to know where he was, whether he was still alive and through the Red Cross, I found where my father lived which was an Island. She had not seen her father since that day of 1939 before World War Il a few days before the war broke out. And then she was this huge star reunited with a total stranger who had abandoned her in this nondescript place, accompanied by her husband who was drifting away from her. And when she met with her father, she never asked for answers and that she could not demand anything from him. When she was telling me the story, she was crying, she said he was so cold. He did not receive her. And she said that really hurt her. That kind of emotional state and the realization that whatever she'd expected, he would not give her. In spite of everything, Audrey decided to forgive him. And that there was no point in trying to right the wrongs or trying to have him admit to what he'd done. There is a sense of her insecurities that translated into her relations with men. And the fear of being of being abandoned, certainly was something that she went through in her relationships. No two people are ever perfect. If there's enough friendship and love, you overcome it or whatever. But obviously when a marriage doesn't work anymore then everything becomes destructive. Audrey was not very happy with men. That's all. I'm going to California next week to talk further about it - With or without your wife? - I'll go without. She's not ready to do anything like that. Audry divorced Mel in '68, but the marriage was already over. My father spent the rest of his life regretting having lost that relationship. That was the relationship of his life and the woman of his life. No doubt about it. I hung on in there as long as I could. For the child's sake, is why we hang on. Also out of respect for the marriage and for love of the person that you certainly once loved. You always hope that if you love somebody enough that everything will be right and things will come together again, but it isn't always true. I wanted to be a mother. Ever since I was a child, I loved babies, and when I was grown up I was going to have lots of babies. I think that has been a conducting theme in my life. It's what's made my decisions always. And because I wanted it so much and wanted to enjoy very much, and not rip myself away from all the time, I started withdrawing. They'd made 'Wait until dark' when Sean had reached the age of six and he had to go to school, but no longer travel with me. And I was just missing him. The studio did want me to either have me wear dark glasses or have a scar near an eye. Be blind in some way. Which worried me terribly. I'd call home and he'd have a fever. And he was so far away and I missed him terribly. I longed for this child. And it just made me too unhappy. So I, more or less quit movies down to stay home. Once she had had her family, She had kind of reached her Apex. she really didn't want that life. She really wanted to be with her family. She just wanted to live in an anonymous life. Unheard of really. She turned her back on Hollywood and movies for 10 years and 10 important years. I cannot think of many people in Hollywood who gave up a career, let alone her career. She was sitting in it. She saw it. She was the first actress to get a million dollars together with Elizabeth Taylor and the red carpets being rolled out and the parts being offered and she stops it. It may have been near the peak of her career when she said I'm choosing to put family over another great role, which she was offered when she was always at the top of anyone's list of leading ladies. But because of the difficult life she led as an adolescent and as a teenager, family came first over anything else. I don't want to be made to sound virtuous. It was a very knowing, and if you like selfish decision, it's what made me happy. It was to stay home with my children. It was not a sacrifice because I thought I should take care of my children. The feeling of family is terribly important. I think it's essential. I learned as a child that it's terribly important for a child to have a father. Having my father cut off, or cut himself off, I was desperate. If I could have just seen him regularly, I would have felt he loved me and I would have had a father. and I tried desperately to avoid it for my children. You become very insecure about affection, and terribly grateful for it and you have an enormous desire to give it. I think she had to kind of prove to herself that unconditional love was possible. I think she was just chasing that her in her whole life. In 1969, the common friend of Andrea and Audrey invited them on a cruise. And then they met and they decided to get married. At the beginning of the marriage, she was so pleased to be the wife of a doctor. I remember Audrey helping Andrea to prepare the dose of lithium for the patient. She was so passionate about that. In 1970 Luca was born and we moved to Rome where she lived until '83 or '84. Audrey and Andrea. They have a very strong bond, even if they were so different from each other so different, but the bond was very strong in between the two of them. I knew Andrea Dotti, he was one of the Italian friend when Andrea married Audrey we became immediately friend. Audrey was my neighbor when they lived in Rome in early 70's and my mother was a great friend of Audrey's. She loved Rome. She had an unpretentious house there filled with flowers and she loved being in Rome and Rome loved her. There were many areas where we could meet. It could be the vegetable shop, the butcher. She just put a pair of pants and tee shirt and she would go shopping as everybody else. It was 1972 and we rent a very simple house in a place named Bulgari. There were a little house on the beach and we shared one of this house with Audrey. Audrey was married with Andrea and little Luca was with them. Sean came to visit from time to time. She adore her two children. She really was in love with them and she loved Andrea. Audrey was so happy. But Andrea had a very destructive part of himself, he was a person with a complicated personality. In a way he was the serious doctor. He was very professional. He was a psychiatric. He was really good. And in other end, he was the typical Roman, a young man. He was committing a lot of adultery and he was photographed with over 200 different women. By this one, Italian paparazzi. It was devastating, totally devastating. And Audrey was suffering a lot. She told me I suffered so much. But surely know the doctors never take care of their own families and least of all themselves. They're great with their patients, but they don't want to take care of their family. Your heart just breaks, that's all. Men are human beings with all the frailties women have. Perhaps they are more vulnerable than women. I think you can hurt a man so easily. You cannot judge, you cannot point fingers, you cannot put anybody in a mould. You just got to be lucky enough to find somebody who you can satisfy, and then who pleases you, if you're lucky. I met Andrea. When I visited in Rome, Audrey was under bed rest with Luca. At that time the doctor said, just go to bed early in your pregnancy. So we said like, come on, we'll go out to a club. So he took me clubbing in Rome, which I didn't think was the greatest idea. You should see the pictures from Audrey. In that time, she lost a little bit of light in her eyes. I really couldn't understand why such a sweet lady like her had to find herself with a man that wouldn't deserve her, wouldn't understand her. She wanted to do her best to become a acquainted with the people in Rome. And the people in Rome they have a mentality very different of Audrey. Very, very different to her. They were gossiping, they were superficial. So it was difficult for her to understand. When my second son was born and I was at that time living in Rome, I could take him nowhere, not to a park, not down the street, not put him on a terrace without paparazzi. She is very private. And also she was very very angry with the press. Like people climbing trees and photograph. Everybody wanted to have a picture of her. They didn't even give her freedom in her own house. Audrey's life was affected by people that like wanted to steal her privacy. And this is something nobody can bear. It's not something you wish for your family to have your private life always in front page. I was with Audrey, we went to do shopping and a woman from the public approached me and said is that Audrey Hepburn? And I was about to say yes then I saw Audrey she became pale. And she stared at me saying no, no, no. Off course I said, no, no she's not Audrey Hepburn. She just looked like her. Now she was almost shaking and she said thanks God. You're no idea what can happen. I mean, she was terrified. I think her life was difficult, in her marriage. And I felt that she didn't really wanna act too much anymore. And so I was thrilled that I had her for this picture. When she stepped in front of the camera, she was the ultimate professional. And then when I said cut, she became Audrey with the cigarettes. She was rather nervous. She smoked a lot, very sweet but anxious, fragile. I knew the marriage was a problem. And that she wasn't at her happiest with that marriage at all. She was persuaded to go on with this marriage especially because they have Luca and he wanted to succeed in the marriage. But the in the end it was impossible. I was told that Audrey's getting another divorce and it didn't surprise me. She struggled with the idea of a perfect family, a perfect housewife's life, very simple things that make life easy. I don't think she had that. Everything she had to little bit fight for. Having a miscarriage is heart-rendig. Certainly one of the most traumatic experiences I had. But so is divorce. It's probably one of the worst experiences a human being can go through. I think when you have problems and so forth, you can sense a loneliness, because it is you that has to get it done or you that has to make the decision. We all have an innate loneliness, because finally when the chips are down you are alone. You know, my dad said about my grandmother, that the best kept secret about Audrey was that she was sad. Not really. It really makes me sad to think about, like I think she, I really think she just wanted love and to be loved and, I think she got, I did think she got that in her life, but I think she didn't get it from a lot of people. For the for the woman who was the most loved in the world to have such a lack of love is so sad. There was peace and there is quietness just call them. She could take a very positive energy and she could be at home. And just with the nature and very away from Hollywood, the problems with paparazzi. The name of La Paisible means in French quietness La Paisible was very beautiful house, old farm, totally restored in a beautiful residence. Built in the 18th century in Switzerland, In '84 Luca who went to boarding school at which point she left Rome and moved permanently to Switzerland. After a full life of working ever since she could remember, it's a welcome thing to be able to get away and be in a restful and peaceful place. It was such a charming, beautiful house. It was the house of her dream. She told me, I want just to be relaxed and to be quiet. That's why she turned off so many proposition for movie. She was not the star that people gawked at. If she walked down the street in New York city, people would go crazy. But in Switzerland she was just another person. I only have one life, which is me, my family, my children. I personally do very little publicity as such so that I can have a real life, a private one if you like, but just an everyday ordinary life. Our family started living in La Pausible since the very beginning of their relation with Audrey. My mother was the private cook of Audrey and they cooked a lot together. My parents were close to her because we lived all together. My father was the private gardener, Audrey and my father was totally devoted to the garden. And she was so proud to be able to cook her own vegetables, coming from the gardens. I love that house. I love the garden, the fruit trees and everything grows there and I have my dogs. I don't know anything much about gardening, but I love to mess around in the garden. I find it very pleasant, very relaxing, a good therapy. I look back with enormous happiness on my career. But there's a time for everything. And I think at this point in my life you can't beat it. I'm a very lucky girl. I've been often through hell, but I've always always come out at the other end. Either somebody helped me, or something happened. Robbie's a living example of that. Robert was the companion of Merle Oberon And when Merle died, she left all the possession to Robert. So Robert decide to put all the jewelry of Merle in auction for charity. And at this auction, Robert and Audrey met. We were both very, very unhappy and we did talk about our unhappiness. I was in one of the worst periods at the end of my marriage. So we both cried into our beers. He's very loving, he's a very affectionate man. I can trust him, I trust his love. I never fear that I'm losing it. He reassures me in every way. They were never married but I really think that they had that love for each other, just truly for who they were. Robert was what Audrey needed. Kindness, companion, presence, and safety. It's curious, we found each other both with our Dutch heritage, but it's given something very special to our relationship. It adds to the intimacy of our loving each other and of our friendship. We like the same things, and we like the same life. We love a quiet life, we love the country, we love our dogs. And everything we do together is such fun. We're very happy together. My mother had told me Audrey she was so happy and she explained to my family how I met a fantastic men and she was wondering about what my sister will think to have a new man imagine. So she she asked my mother, what do you think is not a problem? They loved to stay at my mother's house. There was a wing added for my grandmother and that was called Audrey's suite. They would come down and sit in their kitchen and have coffee and talk about menus. And who do you want to invite for dinner. And always a lot of love there. She was very, very happy and she wanted to have a peaceful moment of her life. Her cousin was the Dutch console to Macau and he'd invited her to come and join this beautiful concert that he would put together for UNICEF. She said, why don't you say a few words about children, about your experience in the war, which she did in front of the full room. And after she spoke, it turns out the head of UNICEF, Jim Grant, was in the audience and he approached us. How would you feel about being a full time ambassador for UNICEF. I had looked forward to a period finally after all the traveling that I've done, since I was a child to one day be able to retire there and take care of my garden and the dogs and everything I love, that's my idea of heaven, but I'm moving around the world once again, but I'm happy to do it because for the children I'd go to the moon. I have known UNICEF all my life and it's a marvelous happening for me that they're allowing me to do this. She was happy to support. She was proud and happy. She was offering her noteriety to a good cause. I think all the love that she showed to children and to mothers around the world, I think it was a way of healing for herself too. She did live through the war and it is because she knew not just the hunger of the body, but the hunger of the soul that she was able to connect to these children. The first thing I remember after our liberation in Holland was the Red Cross and UNICEF coming in and filling all the empty buildings that they could find. With food and clothing and medication. I was suffering from a rather high degree of malnutrition when the war ended. So God knows, I know the value of food. I think my whole life has been formed by those memories. As a child. I knew about this side of life, so much suffering and so much poverty. Those images have never, never left me. But I think perhaps the most important thing, which I carried through life of that particular period was as things got worse, there's something marvelous about humanity is under circumstances like that, you need each other more. And if this career has left me with something very special, it's the fact that it's left me with this voice, this curiosity, people have still to see me to talk to me, which I can use for the good of children. - Where do I go? - You can go back here. Go back here. What I really am as a messenger if you like for UNICEF. There's so much involved apart from seeing and meeting the media and talking to people and in general, it's advocacy for the needs of a child. And there's so many children. So there's lots to do. Audrey took very seriously the commitment. And before any mission, she studied the situation. She studied politically and she got very involved with all the social problem and against their will to be peaceful. She started to be involved in this very stressing mission. At the end of the war, she saw a society and a promise that we would never do this again. And that we were putting safeguards to prevent that. And now she's propelled 35 years later and finds herself in a camp in Somalia. In September of 1992, I was in Somalia reporting for the associated press about the famine that was gripping the country. Audrey was visiting programs that UNICEF was involved in for malnourished children. In a place like Somalia, you could see that there really was not enough food to help. And I think she was very upset that there was so much death. Then she realized the vastity, the tragedy of what we've seen. In a sense you are marked from that and you want to go back and back and back again. In a way is a sort of addiction? I knew that she was roiling in anxieties and things. She wanted to relieve pain but she couldn't. She was mad at the fact that this was being allowed in the 20th century, after the deprivations that she lived through because of a World War. We're not in a world war. And there's no reason for children who be hungry anywhere. To see small children just die in front of your eyes because they're starving. It's just is so totally unacceptable. And I'm filled with a rage at ourselves. I don't believe in collective guilt, but I do believe in collective responsibility. I think from the moment that you've been in the field, so to speak, from the minute you've seen a child gasping for air. And in his last moments, you rush home and do what you can about it. I'm Audrey Hepburn. This is an urgent appeal for the children of... She was an altruist woman. And she believed that the base of everything is to educate children and to take care of them. And she gave so much devotion to children. I would go to many countries and we would meet between and she would want to know, what did you see in Mali? What did you see in Somalia? So she always wanted to know what's going on. She wanted to go to Bangladesh because she said that everybody is giving up on Bangladesh because they have the flood every year during monsoon and the landslides. So she said, those are the people I'd like to go and support. She was trying everything to involve important people to their cause. She showed up once in front of the US Congress asking for an additional funding for a particular emergency and got the $60 million in one hour from them. That showed how extraordinarily powerful she still was. She used her name for something good. If everybody did that, the world would be a little bit better. She was selfless she didn't stop. She just wanted to go on and complete her mission. Robert used to tell me, I wish they would give some time for her between this and that UNICEF would say, I think it'll be good if you went to Sudan. So she wanted to go. And I was concerned too. And I would ask her sometimes, she said, no, no, no, I'm tough. I can take it. I'll go. So she went, she would say, sometimes I even feel whether it's doing any good. I would tell her the same thing as a photo journalist. Sometimes I wonder if anything is happening from my photographs. But then each time she went and did a promotional thing, UNICEF always said they got more than a million dollars because of her appearance in any of the talk shows or TV shows. So that's what made her happy. She joined UNICEF and five years later, UNICEF had doubled in size. And I don't think this had happened before since the war. Dignity and love is what we always talked about, I think she struggled to find love. And I think that's probably the reason why she is so emphasizes on love. With all the sufferings that she went through. She missed a part of that kind of love that she expected and she wanted. And that's why I think she wants to share that with the children. She would always say, I love you. And she will never hold back. She was so compassionate about children who are suffering. She truly loved humanity. Humanitarian means human welfare and responding to human suffering. That's finally what politics should be. I think perhaps with time, instead of there being a politicalization of humanitarian aid, there'll be a humanization of politics. I dreamed the day that it would be all one. We cannot afford to give up. We have the resources we have the time and we must have the love to take care of these millions of children. Well, I understood that something was going on one week in particular because Audrey had a walk in the garden and my father was working in the garden and he ask Audrey when are you going to come again to help me? And she said I will help you, but never as I helped you before. I will help you but differently. When we were in Somalia together, we were taking pills for malaria and they make me sick. So I said to Audrey, I think I going to give up this Laurium because I'm sick. And she said, I'm thinking myself, I have a lot of pain in my stomach. And I think it is the pill of malaria. I give up also. But it was not the malaria pills that they gave her all this pain in the stomach there. She definitely knew something was wrong and she never talked about it. And she kept it to herself. For UNICEF, I went to Sarajevo to cover a mission on this city was sieged. And I was there two months without no contact with anybody because we are in the siege. And after two months, I got hold of a telephone line. So I call her house and, and Giovanna answered. And I say, Giovanna give me Madam. And Giovanna say, Mara Senora is not here. You don't know is all over on all the press, she's very sick as she is in Los Angeles. I said no. I no idea. Giovanna kept crying. And I was frozen. So I called Robert and he says, she has a cancer and say, she's on chemo. She said, no, no chemo. So when you say no chemo, I knew the situation was really bad. My mother was invited to fly with her to Switzerland if she chose to. But my mother said no, I'll say goodbye to you here. I want to see you leaving with a smile on your face. Between the two of them. She knew it was a... They would not be seeing each other again. Nobody thought it was something so bad and so fast. She was very peaceful. And usually you are afraid, but she wasn't. She was very sick. And she asked me how I felt. She had something in her heart. Otherwise you don't react like this in the last moments of your life. She was in her bedroom and we were all standing around her. I gave her last kiss. And this was the last time I saw her, yes. My mother died January 20th, 1993 at 8:00 PM. I was the one that the nurse had left all of the knowhow on how to take care of the pain medication and change her dressings. I would sit in the wicker chair next to her bed in the last few weeks of her life. And I would sit there and sort of doze off. And then she'd wake up in the middle of the night. And we talked about those things that mattered to her. I think she always felt throughout her life that she had shortcomings. She felt that the mistake is to sit there and forever hold a grudge one way or the other. She had to make peace with life because she didn't have a choice. She often said that it was a fortune not to have a choice to have to move forward. As a child, I was taught, it was bad manners to draw attention to yourself, and never ever to make a spectacle of yourself. I then went on to make a rather nice living doing just that. Audrey Hepburn was most certainly revolutionary. The legacy of artistry. The legacy of joy, She came from so much intensity. She definitely stood for something timeless that I don't think will ever get old. And even today, I think she's still inspiring. She's an utter icon. She's everywhere all the time. And so in a way, part of her is still here. Her legacy is still here. She most certainly took trauma and transmuted it into love. A lot of people don't receive love and they grow into being, really unhappy and spiteful. But I think she was so much better at loving because of it now and loving those people who really need it. The love she did not get, she transformed into a greater sense of giving and of love. And this is, I guess, why is she so loved to this day. She's gone through difficult moments, but her humanity and her way of being grateful to her life. She wanted to share that with others and She found the way. She said at one point that the 1992 Christmas was the best Christmas she ever had because she said that she was sure that we loved her. She was a person who was able to love. She loved very much Robert and she loved her children of course. And by the end of her life, she loved herself. At the end of her life, she described people in the room. That these were the people on the other side that were gonna take her from here. She said you cannot see them but they're sitting right there and they're waiting for me. Perhaps the most important thing which I carried through life is that whatever I've suffered has helped me make later on. And when I love, I love unconditionally.
