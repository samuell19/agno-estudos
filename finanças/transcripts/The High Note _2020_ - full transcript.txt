Jack, there hasn't been a new Grace Davis record in a decade, and the fans want one. - Okay. - We need one. Let me tell you something... I've been managing Grace longer than you've probably been alive. So you think she should do new material? - Yeah. - Okay. Guess what. Don't nobody give a shit about new material. Okay? That last album she did, it didn't do as well as she had hoped. Matter of fact, those was not Grace Davis numbers, and you know it. That was a reality check, people letting us know it's time to move on. - To a Vegas residency? - Yeah. Don't nobody want to go to no Yankee Doodle Springsteen concert and hear him play that Wrecking Ball folksy bullshit. Actually, that was an incredibly poignant album, and it did extremely well.

Hanky's been playing this drum track for 20 years, and it still sounds as tight as it did on the day you recorded it. - Richard. - R-Dawg. Did you redo this with a synth? It's actually called cross synthesis, which I invented, which takes one synth and cancels the other out when they play at the same time. Sounds dope. That doesn't make any sense. - Yeah, it does. - It does. You've heard of cross synthesis, right? No, but it don't matter. - You the producer. - Yeah. You took out the backup singers?

How do you, um... How do you know how to do all of this stuff? I grew up around music and musicians and people talking about music. My dad worked in radio, and my mom was a singer. And then I went to school for composing, and then immediately after, I started, um, producing. If you could point to any time in my life, good or bad, I could tell you who I was listening to and how I got through it. And if I had the opportunity to work with an artist like you and create something that could maybe make somebody or anybody feel a little bit less alone, then I want to be a part of that.

Um, I'm gonna need you to fight the urge to get really mad at me right now. Okay. I mean, what's going on? Um, well, there's been a little change of plans. First of all... I'm not a producer. - What? - I mean, I am, but I'm not a real one. I'm a personal assistant. I'm just... I'm an assistant to a big-time singer who is having a big party tonight, and her whole label is gonna be there and a lot of other music people, and you're gonna sing for them. That's gr...

I trusted you, and I have never trusted an assistant like that before. Do not tell Gail. But you were very good at your job. And you worked harder than... anyone else ever has, and you loved it, and... which is... And you love my music. And I appreciate that. Well, thank you for coming all the way here to tell me that. Maggie, that's not why I came here. I came here to tell you that the work you did on the live album was very good. - Really? - Yes. I would have filled in the audience track a little bit more, and I think you overmixed - in some places. - Okay. But you made me sound... ...like me. Me. I haven't heard her in a long time.
