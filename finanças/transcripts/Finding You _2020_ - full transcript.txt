Please let me get in. Finley Sinclair? Yes! Is that you? Yeah. How'd it go? So much for prayers. Oh, honey. You can still audition one more time in the fall. Come here. I know. You might need to think about a plan B. Maybe what you need is a change of scenery. Maybe I can try that Semester Abroad program that Alex did. I'd like to welcome you on this flight to Dublin, Ireland. It will take us approximately six hours and ten minutes of flight time... Hey, there's an extra seat in first class if you want it. It's a long flight to Ireland. - Yes, please. - Come on. Have fun. - Magazine. - Yeah, thank you. Sir, your friend needs to put her seat belt on. Yeah, thanks. As much as I'd love a beautiful girl drooling on my shoulder, you better buckle up. I'm... I'm so sorry. Um... And don't worry, your snoring is cute. I'm so sorry. I don't... I didn't even think I would fall asleep. It's not something I... - Beckett Rush? - Geez. I've gotten this far without being bothered, all right. Look, if you keep quiet, I'll give you an autograph or something when we land. Just, no body parts, I stopped doing that a while ago. - Oh. - Flight attendant probably thought she was making your year seating you next to me. We can do a selfie or something, just when we land. All right. I don't want to attract any attention right now. I really don't want anything from you. Somebody's grumpy when they wake up. No, but arrogance makes me grumpy. Some people mistake confidence for arrogance. I'm pretty sure it's just arrogance. I know your type. So, since you know my name, I think it's only fair that I know yours. Finley Sinclair. And what brings you to Ireland, Finley Sinclair? A Semester Abroad program at my college. My brother did this a few years ago, and he loved it. Changed his whole life. Maybe it'll work for me. Hmm. So you have issues? Life can be tough outside of the celebrity bubble. You know, in the real world. - A bit of advice for you. - Hmm? You might wanna brush up on your people skills if you're gonna make it in a small Irish town. Oh! And are you an expert on small towns in Ireland? Yeah, I am, actually. We've shot three Dawn of the Dragon movies there. About to shoot number four. Touch√©. I sit corrected. You know, you look really beautiful when you admit that you're wrong. Yeah, I didn't like that article either. Ba-bye! Bye! Whoa! You any good on that thing? Not good enough. But I'm going to be practicing a lot while I'm here, and working on a new audition piece. Sounds boring, but suit yourself. Who knows, maybe we'll run into each other in a pub somewhere, Spindly? It's Finley, and I seriously doubt that. Well, I hope you find what you're looking for and maybe even a little bit of fun, while you're at it. Welcome to Ireland, Felicity Sinclair. It's... Peace out. Have a nice trip. Bye, bye. Okay, never mind. Oh, my gosh, it's Beckett. Oh, my gosh. - Will you sign this for me? - All right, okay, one at a time. Finley! Hey you. Oh! You look exactly like your picture. - Emma? - We're sisters for four months. Okay, it's nice to meet you, too. I heard Beckett Rush is at the airport. His new movie is like the biggest thing that has ever happened in Carlingford. Do you like him? You know, a little too cocky for me. I love him. Fact! Hello, Finley! - Hi! - It is so good to have you. We just loved your brother. He was one of the family. And now you are, too. The good news is that we inherited a bed and breakfast three months ago. Sean has retired from the army, and we're running it together. We're still trying to figure it all out. Come on, everyone, let's get going before we get into the second hour in the car park. I'll get your luggage. Thank you, I can get this at least. Take this. This town might be a wee bit small for a New York girl, but we'll get you out to show you the rest of the country soon. I can't wait to see it all. The old castles, the Cliffs of Moher. My brother used to talk about that place all the time. - We'll take you all over. - That would be amazing. Here we are. Emma, go show Finley to her room. I'll give you the full tour later. There's a trampoline around the back. If you jump high enough, you can see into the next-door neighbor's bathroom. Don't worry, all the guests are at the other side of the house. You can play your violin up here anytime. No one will hear ya. This is my room. Mom thought that you'd like your own one. But yours has the best views. My nan used to live in it. She actually died there. I wouldn't be scared about that. Obviously, I'm around the corner if you ever wanna talk, do nails, sister things Leave her alone, Emma. Finley needs some rest. She has her orientation in the morning. Out! Good morning, Finley. - Hey, did you sleep well? - All right. So, we're just busy serving the guests. Pour yourself some tea. Sean'll cook you some eggs. Coming right up! I need to get my hair to behave. Emma, you mustn't go out there! I don't want you disturbing the guests. Last time, I found her chatting on for half an hour with one of the guests about her earthworm collection. I have a passion for biology. They don't need to hear about earthworm droppings at breakfast. Go around. Why do you always have to... Always go clockwise! That's our new system! Never mind. This is getting cold. And we can't afford any bad reviews. We can't go out there wearing cranberry juice. What would our guests think of that? Love, I hate to ask. But would you mind taking this to the gentleman in the corner? All you have to do is set the plate down on the table, smile, and walk away. Yeah, of course. You? Good morning to you as well. You didn't spit in my food, did you? - What are you doing here? - What does it look like? - I'm a guest. - In one of these rooms? Yeah, that's usually how it works. Are you stalking me? - No! - I thought you might be. I didn't buy that whole "I'm not interested" bit. I'm staying here, too. - What, the Callahans are your host family? - Yeah. - Oh. Shouldn't you be at some boujee hotel with your harem? What are you talking about? This is boujee. It's posh. The cooking's great. And the service is even better. Usually. I have to go to orientation, so enjoy. Well, I'll be staying here for the next few months while we film. So, no sneaking up - into my room, young lady. - Ooh. Don't worry. I'm not supposed to bother the guests. Even if they bother me. What do you have against me? I am trying to stay focused... and I just don't think you're gonna help with that. - And how would you know? - I see the news. Well, maybe things aren't always as they seem. I know your type. I'll see you later, Frankey. Hmm. It's Finley, but good try. Um... Why is Beckett Rush in the dining room? What? No. No, that's definitely him. You can't tell anyone. Beckett... Becket Rush is in my house. I'd never even heard of him till yesterday. Of course, you didn't. You're such a dad. He's only like, the biggest movie star in the world. She's got posters of him in her room. Ah, that's why I recognized him. Nora, dear. Do you have any jam for the scones? Yes, sure, love. Just made it fresh yesterday. Ah. Brilliant. Cheers. Your daughter has lost her mind. This is exactly why I didn't want to tell her. Now not a word. We have promised him to keep it quiet. The whole town is gonna find out. Well, it's not gonna be because of us. We are going to give him a place away from the press. If they find out, the B&B could be at risk. We can't afford a bad review from an international celebrity right when we're starting out. Oh, shite! I heard the Heart Slayer is staying at your B&B? See, the whole town knows, and I can't say a word. Don't worry, Irish small towns are good at keeping secrets. The people here won't let it out. Yeah, and if they do, my parents'll lose their entire life savings, and I'll end up in an orphanage. Your mom is going to be washing his sheets. How insane is that? Not the first thing that came to my mind, but yes. Hey, maybe Beckett will ask you to the dance. Right. The hottest guy in the whole world is gonna break up with Taylor Risdale. Look me in the eye and say, "Hey, Emma, will you go out with me?" No one has ever even asked me to it. Bull. What's this dance? It's the big town festival that happens every autumn. It's where all of our parents fell in love. It's disgusting. It's amazing. The whole town comes out for it. Outside, under the lights. - It's so romantic. - Or depressing. Guys are already starting to ask. Well, maybe this is your year. Yeah, maybe. Any lads you fancy yet? It's just my first day. Maybe Beckett will ask you. I think he prefers his snooty celebrity soirees. Not really my type. Dragons! To the bottom lines. Archers, at the ready! Oriana! My love! Come with me, I'll protect you. My bow! Stay close. Hurry up, keep going. If you save me, my father might finally accept our love, my one true knight. Duck! More dragons. We have to go, now! I am Steele Markov, son of Talagorn. May this arrow be true, and find the heart of this beast. Cut! Okay, guys, back to one. How was that? Did you feel it? Yeah. Sure. Beck. Beck. Beck. Beck. Beck. Beck. How are you, man? Okay yeah, everything good? - Yeah. - What the bloody hell was that? Huh? I just thought I'd try something a little more subtle, you know? Subtle? Can you amp it up, man? - I can amp it up. - Great. Okay, good. Because, if not, my friend, I am afraid, we're going to have to kill off your character. I am joking. I no serious. I make a joke, used to feel. Okay, he can do it, guys. He's okay. Let's go. He can do it, I think. Back to one! Take 17. You okay? - Yeah. - All right, good. Hey, listen, I heard the studio is considering a trilogy of Steele Markov spin-off movies for you and Taylor. So, you'll finally be getting paid what you're worth, plus back end. So, you know, just give him what he wants. - Yeah. - Yeah. Don't screw this up. Okay, just give me some space. Okay. Yes, whatever you need. Of course. I'm here for you. All right. Thanks. So one more like that, please. Do it again. - It's just me. - Oh, come in, Nora. Finley, I'm sorry, but we can't take you to the Cliffs of Moher this weekend. Sean has to fix a heater and re-tile a bathroom, so I have to do the hosting while he's working. Oh, that's... yeah, that's okay. But I got you a bike down at the shops today. So, you can use that to get around town at least. Thank you. Yeah. No. You know, we... I have plenty of time - to see the rest of the country. - Aye, plenty. Listen, I was, um... cleaning up in here a few weeks ago, getting the place ready for you. And I found this under the dresser. It's Alex's journal from when he was here. I didn't pry, or look or anything, but maybe just a little. Enough to see it's got all his drawings and writings. It's old-fashioned like. Yeah, he was like that. I was gonna send it to your mum, but... then I just thought I'd give it to you. I... I wouldn't want it to get lost in the post. Thank you, Nora. This is... amazing. He was always working on those drawings. Now you can see all the things he loved here. Yeah, he was so at peace, you know, when he... when he came back, and... he was just an amazing brother. He was. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to bring up sad memories. It's okay. Are you done yet? I don't like dead bodies near my feet. Yeah, are there more crosses like this around here? Yeah, like everywhere. Oh. Oh, come on, Finley. I think something just touched me. Yeah. I've got to get practicing anyway. Good. Let's go. Run! It's no bother. Oh, sorry about that. Have a good day. Come on, Finley. Okay. Nora? You can just come in. What are you doing here? You're pretty good on that thing, you know. You heard me? Yeah, you play like your personality. And how is that? Beautiful, but a bit stiff. What are you doing up here anyway? - I'm about to ask you a favor. - I'm about to say no. And I'm about to ignore that. I need some help running my lines, - like somebody to work off with. - No. How can you say no to this face? Huh? Oh, well, I am up-to-date on all of my shots and immune to everything. - Come on, Frankie. - It's Finley. No wonder you don't remember your lines. Look... Things have been tough on set. and my scenes aren't going well. Um... I'm in my head, and I need something new to break me out of it. Yeah, I... I know all about that. Cool drawing. Do you do this? No. Hey, I did not say you could come in. Why? Are all your deepest, darkest secrets in there? No, this is my brother's from when he spent time here. I just... I can't get this cross out of my mind. I mean, why would he write my name at the bottom of this? Have you seen this anywhere? Yeah, there's crosses like that all over the place. No. I need to find this one. So why don't you just text him and ask him where it is? He's... dead. Oh! Wow. I'm sorry. I didn't... I didn't know. What happened? I don't really talk about it. Especially not with Steele Markov, the heart slayer. Well, I'd like to think I'm a little bit more than that. If you ever wanna talk, I'm here. Seriously. Well, not here in this room, exactly. 'Cause I'm not allowed in. We could talk downstairs or wherever you want. Okay, let's go. Where? Run your lines. Really? 'Cause we don't have to. Come on, before I change my mind. Oriana, we must find a way. Don't give up on us. My father is the king. He won't allow anything to interfere with his conquest. He's going to marry me off to the Prince of Moor. He'll kill you if you get in the way. Well, I'd rather die loving you than live without you. My heart can't handle living a lie. Come on. - I'm sorry. - Okay. - It's so bad. - Okay! Okay, okay, okay. Just give me a minute here. I got to find it. Right. Okay... Oriana, we must find a way. Don't give up on us. I'm doing it to protect you. My father is the king. He won't let anyone interfere with his conquest. I'll find a way. They're going to marry me off to the Prince of Moor. If you get in the way, they'll kill you. I'd rather die loving you than live without you. My heart can't handle living a lie. How was that? Um... that was... that was great. Uh, not stiff at all that time. I need to... I really... I need to go to bed. I have class tomorrow, so... Oh, that sounds amazing. Yeah, you should try it sometime. I wish I could. I mean, I'd love to go to college. Yeah, well... Hey, thanks for this. Seriously, you were great. Yeah, any time. Night, Francine. As part of your Irish studies class, you must complete a service project in order to see this country from a different perspective. So, each one of you will be adopting a senior citizen from one of the nearby nursing homes. You will spend at least 20 hours with your new friend, and you will do what you can to serve them during this time. At the end of the semester, you will be expected to turn in an essay outlining what you have learned from this experience. So, thank you so much for coming down to help. You'll find her right through here. Okay, thanks so much. - Hello, Mrs. Sweeney. - Get out. Oh, I'm Finely Sinclair. I don't care if you're the Blessed Virgin Mary. Get out! Um... Uh, I was actually... I'm here from the college. I was assigned to you. I'm just... I don't need schoolgirls pestering me. I'll give you three seconds to remove yourself. One, two, three. Nurse! Um... Nurse! - Nurse! - No, it's okay. - I'll... - What's going on here? I have an intruder. Don't you remember our conversation, Cathleen? What about? Me eating more prunes? The one about you being civil to people who come to visit you. I don't need any visitors. I didn't last year or the year before, and I don't today. You know what? I'm sure I can get reassigned. It was... I'm sorry. It was really nice to meet you. But can't you just give me some other old person? Please, I mean, she's a crazy witch. If I reassign you, I'm then gonna have to make allowances for all the other students. And I'm not gonna deal with that. But she doesn't want me or anyone else there. Please. The staff wouldn't have assigned her a student if she didn't need it. Isn't there just a food bank or an orphanage or just anything else? This is the assignment. If you choose not to do it, you won't pass your Irish studies class. I need to get a good grade on this. Then you'll have to go make broomsticks with the witch. Cheers. Hello again, Mrs. Sweeney. I think we got off to a bad start the other day. How... How many times do I have to tell you to leave this bloody room? Oh, I can't do that, Mrs. Sweeney. But we're gonna be friends. I did bring Pride and Prejudice. I don't like Jane Austen. It's too bad. And I don't want to spend all that remains of my life with the likes of yourself. Okay, you know what? I tried to get out of this, but I can't. I was really hoping for a sweet old granny, but I got stuck with you. So, now I have to do this to get a good grade, so I can be good enough to get into this music school. I have one last chance to audition in three months. So, we're gonna be friends, whether you like it or not! - Have you finished? - Uh-hmm. If this is what young people have come to, then the whole world is doomed. I'm calling the nurse. - Nurse! - Okay. Well, I'm not leaving. Nurse! "It is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of good fortune must be in want of a wife." - Nurse Where's the nurse? - "However..." - Nurse! - What's all this noise? She won't leave. She's invading my privacy. I want to remove her at once! Did you enter without her permission? Yeah. Yes. And did you refuse to leave when Mrs. Sweeney asked you to do so? Yes. Good on you, young one. Cathleen, you can shout all you like, but Finley's welcome to stay. Bye, ladies. If it's any consolation, this went much better in my head. Hmm. "It is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good fortune must..." She calm down? Yeah, she fell asleep. I have to check on a resident. Do me a favor and pop this into her top drawer. Cathleen always tells me to throw her post away, but I know she just digs these letters out of the bin and saves them. No idea what it's about. Hey, how was the nursing home? Well, that bitter old lady, Mrs. Sweeney, really hates me. They've assigned you Cathleen Sweeney? Uh-hmm. Who is this lady? I wanna meet her. I bet you I could make her smile. Not a chance. Gather round! Fresh scones! Damn it! When are you going to learn? Try a scone, guys. Thanks, love. Brilliant, Mr. Callahan. Finally, something we can agree on. How's the movie going? - I know Emma wants to know. - Dad! Well, it wasn't going well until I started running lines with Finley. Now the director can't stop complimenting me. He says Steele Markov has come alive. Oh. Do you think we could run my other lines, tonight, maybe? I really need to get to my violin composition at some point. Well, I can work around your schedule. I mean, if you want to come to set after class or... Or we could work here? Uh, there's nothing special about what I did. Anyone could have done it. - Thank you, Nora. - Hey, do you think we can go to the Cliffs of Moher this weekend? I am so sorry, honey. I feel terrible. These scrapbookers are here all weekend. - We can't leave. - It's okay. Well, I could take you. Uh, no, I'll just go with them when they can. All right. Let me know if you change your mind. - Tom. - Taken. - Francis. - Taken. - Shaun. - Taken. - Why? - He has a micro scooter. - Does he? - Yes. I can see the look in the eyes when young ladies are thinking about the festival. I hear the fellas are starting to ask. Molly runs the pub. - Oh, hi! Finley. - Hey, it's where I met me husband. A magical night. See, it's like everyone. Hey. I've been asked a couple of times. - Of course you have. - You'll be there, Emma? I mean, I know it's been difficult for you in the past. I mean, it was so sad, seeing you alone last year, but... I mean, I can help you out, if you want. But, I just got cast in the new Beckett Rush film, I just have to run on set and shoot some things with Beckett and Taylor. But I'll see you guys around. Get away from my shop, you old drunk. - Come on. - Relax, Aileen. - Run. - I was gonna buy a book. Have you got any of those romantic novels for sale? - Get out of here. Go. - All right. I'll leave. But I won't come back here buy me books here anymore. You're scaring my customers. Well, good afternoon, young ladies. Any chance of the price of a pint for a local struggling musician, who places his art above all else? Look, I would, Seamus. But I only have 1.47 and a lollipop. Well, it's a start. Seamus, go sleep it off in the back of the pub. You're right, Molly. Thanks, but no thanks. Ladies! Got to take care of me best customer, and tonight's musical entertainment. He's been napping here in the streets for years. He's got a little cottage up the road, but he rarely makes it back there at night. What can you do? It's his life. He'd rather buy fiddles than pay the bills. I better help him. Good luck! A convertible in Ireland? Yeah. I want to be ready for the three days a year it doesn't rain. - What are you doing? - I was actually looking for that cross. Oh, you're not gonna find it here. - How do you know? - 'Cause I already checked. Oh. Okay. But listen, I'm a little worried about you hanging out in graveyards like this. It's pretty creepy. So, I'm gonna offer you a deal. - Not interested. - Just hear me out, okay. You help me with my lines, and I'll be your personal tour guide. Show you all the sights of Ireland. Huh? Come on. It'll help sweet Mrs. Callahan feel less guilty that she can't take you around. Totally harmless. - Trust me. - No, I don't. No, no, no, no. I'm merely a humble tour guide. And for a limited time only, I'm gonna offer you a free tour. Just to make sure you know you're getting the better end of the deal. So, come on. Let's go. I'm taking you to the Cliffs of Moher. I can't. We can't go now. Don't you have a photo shoot to do? No. I told them I had to help my boring friend learn how to have some fun. Come on, Finley. Take a risk. You never know if you're gonna have tomorrow. Okay. Here we are, at the Cliffs of Moher. And what's that? This is my disguise, young lady. Pretty inconspicuous, don't you think? Breathtaking cliffs ahead, and you're taking picture of grass, come on. Well, there's not that much of it in Brooklyn. Is that Beckett Rush? I was hoping for just one day without this. Can we please get a selfie? Johnny, don't you worry about that nasty rash you have. I still love you. - What is she saying? - Oh Franny, my dear. Don't you think we ought to get married? It's only right after you gave me those twins at the ripe young age of 16. I'm an unwed mother? I'm a diseased baby daddy. What do you want from me? Come on, I think we should leave it. Okay, come on. Let's go. Okay, they're gone. You can let go of my hand now. You were holding on to me. Okay? Whatever. That was close. Thanks a lot for protecting me. No problem. So, what's the big deal with these cliffs anyway? Just you wait. Come on, hurry up, hurry up. Come on. Come on, come on. See. Now this... this is Ireland. Huh? It's wild. It's amazing, it's... - Beautiful. - I know. All right, come on. There's better views up ahead. Come on. Come on, come on, come on. Can I ask you a personal question? Do you even really like being a movie star? I mean, who wouldn't, right? It's not what I asked. What was it like going to high school? It's... grueling, and fun and weird, all at once. That sounds amazing. Oh, yeah. No, I mean it. You're lucky. Well, didn't you go to school on set? Usually, it was just me. Sometimes, a few other child actors and a tutor. But no prom. No graduation. No embarrassing gym class. Do you regret missing out on that? I regret a lot of things. I bet those birds don't regret anything, though? They're just... free. I don't know, I guess sometimes I just miss blending in, being normal, you know. There's the real Beckett. Rolling, quiet, no moving around, turn over Three, two, one. Action! Wow! I'll have someone tell him you're here. Oriana, it is not yet wise to reveal your magical powers. Indeed. I will keep the men until the time is right. Just like our love. Cut! Oh! Taylor, Beckett, really great. You are marvelous, my dear. Finley! Hey, what are you doing here? Did you sneak onto set? I mean, I'm not going to tell anybody. No. Beckett invited me. I wonder what my girl Taylor will have to say about that. Finley! Hey! - Hey! - You made it! So, what do you think? It's amazing. - Yeah. - Hey babe, who's this? Finley, this is Taylor. Uh, she's here to help me out. Kind of like an acting coach. So... How kind! Um, so, what other actors have you worked with before? I actually haven't worked with any other actors before. This is my first time on set, but it seems pretty cool. She's a real natural though. Interesting. We should probably go run the lines for the next scene. Come on, Finley, this way. It's a real honor to meet you, Taylor. The pleasure is all mine. Come on, this side. Tired from working on set all day? Me, no! I am perfectly fine 'cause I did nothing. Well, that's what usually happens on a movie set. Nobody does anything. Oh! Uh, is this one of your girlfriends? Yeah. No, it's... - Beckett! - My manager. They got me staying here tonight. My hotel suite won't be ready until tomorrow. Oh, hello, and you are? Hey, Finley Sinclair. I'm Beckett's father, Montgomery. Oh! It's so nice to meet you. It is an absolute pleasure to meet you. Did you get those scripts I over-nighted? Yeah, the first two Dawn of the Dragon spin-offs? You read them? Not yet. I've been kind of busy. Yeah, the studio is really, really, in love with what you're doing on set. So, they made an official offer. It's strong. Five movies over seven years. Oh! I don't know though. Don't you think it's time to maybe branch out a little? To what? We're building an empire here. To something that shows what I can really do. I want to do something more than just sword fighting and... outrunning fireballs. Oh, but you're so good at it. That's what the fans wanna see. Right? Isn't that right? You have a very small window to capitalize on this. Yeah, I'll think about it, for sure. Right now, we gotta cash in on these sequels. So, hurry up and read those scripts. All right. Let's do it. - Yeah, I will. - Yeah. Do they come out and get your bags here or... No. Don't worry, I've got it, Dad. Okay, great. So sorry to bore you with all of that. I want to hear all about you. Where are you from? - Uh, New York. - New York? The Big Apple. Good morning, Mrs. Sweeney. And how are we today? I brought a Twilight book. Who are you? Belinda did warn me that you might pretend to be senile. I don't want the sun. Oh, that explains it. The vampires have gotten to you, too. You'll really like this book. I'll decide what I like. "It was 75 degrees in Phoenix. The sky a perfect cloudless blue. I was wearing my favorite shirt, sleeveless..." It's cold. I want to go inside. You know, Mrs. Sweeney, um... Who's Fiona Doyle? What? That's none of your business. Oh, yeah. I just... I thought that maybe I could help you find the right address. I have the right address. - Then why... - I don't want to discuss it. Okay. You've been snooping in my drawers. Uh... What's up, ladies? Groovy day, don't you think, man? Convincing. Do you need directions to Woodstock? Whoa, sister! Give peace a chance. Mrs. Sweeney, this is Beckett Rush. He's an actor in Dragon movies. Mrs. Sweeney, it's very lovely to meet you. I've heard a lot about you. Yes! I've seen you on television. You're in love with the princess. Um, hey, I brought you some treats because I know they're not giving you the good stuff here. Although I know it's nothing like your cooking. You're probably a wiz in the kitchen. Baking is my specialty. Sugar and spice, my kinda lady. You really can't turn it off, can you? There's nothing wrong with spreading a little cheer. Come on, make love, not war. Tell me, when did you start acting? I was seven years old. My father got me into it. - No! - Do you ever do any acting? Oh, yes. What was your first role? At school, I played the white rabbit. The white rabbit. You look kinda like the white rabbit. You're funny. You're a twit. Thank you so much. All right, thanks for letting me stop by, guys. Okay. Peace out. Peace. He's a fine young man. He's a total player. Don't tell me, I don't know what I'm talking about. He's a good boy. I can spot a bad one a mile away. Now, carry on reading your book. "In the Olympic Peninsula of Northwest Washington state..." Thank God we've kept Beckett hidden from them so far. Hey Do you know much about Mrs. Sweeney? I don't like to say things if I've got nothing nice to say. Well, she's not that bad. No, she's not bad. She's terrible. So then, who's Fiona Doyle? Her sister. Oh. Mrs. Sweeney really wants to get in touch with her. What happened there? I heard Cathleen Sweeney stole her own sister's fianc√©. I mean, who would do such a thing? I'm saying no more. Then, she left him, a few years after they get married. He was heartbroken. They say he drank himself to death not long after. That's it. I'm saying no more. But if Mrs. Sweeney is the man stealer, then why is she the one that's so bitter? Just getting what she deserved, I guess. It's your friendly Irish tour guide. Hey! Let's take this out of your hands. Let's actually be really careful with that. We don't really need it because I have got the rest of the week off, and it's time for your next tour. We're about to have ourselves some real Irish fun. It's not a good idea for me to be going out to one of your exclusive nightclubs or whatever it is you do. And who says that I'm into nightclubs? Uh, every tabloid in the supermarket checkout line. Well, don't believe everything you read. Beckett, I really have to practice. Hey, as your tour guide, it's my job to make sure you don't spend all of your time in Ireland cooped up in this room. It's what you find outside of this place that's gonna help you write your try-out song. It's a composition. Whatever. God, you are so uptight. No I'm not. Oh yeah, you kind of are. Fine. Where are we going? You will see, milady. Come on, let's go. I'm not even dressed! No, you are perfect just the way you are. Come on, let's go. We're gonna be late. Wait. This is my favorite place in all of Ireland. This is exactly what I was afraid of. Just trust me. Oh! Good golly, Mrs. Molly! I've missed you! If it isn't me favorite fella! - Finley! - Hi, Molly. Give everybody a round on me! Drinks are on me! Cole, you stand guard at the door. Make sure no reporters get in here. Beckett Rush rules! No pictures! These guys are great. Where's Seamus? He's already had a few pints. Looks like it's time to wake him up then. Come on. You could learn a thing or two from this guy. What am I gonna learn from him? He's like, homeless, and... You'll see. Don't worry. Seamus! Oh Molly, let me just crash here tonight, will you? Oh, you can crash with me any time. Oh, it's you, boy. What do you want? Well, what do you think I want? I want you to get this party started! I brought this American girl here to show her some real Irish fun. We can do that. Whoo! He's great. Thank you, boys. I'm told we've got a fine young fiddler player here in the audience tonight. Can you go up and give us a tune, please. No. I don't play fiddle. I play the violin. Oh, fiddle, faddle, fuddle, whatever you call it, it doesn't matter. Come on up here and join us, lass. Oh, come on, go up there. - Come on. - Come on, girl! We won't bite ya! Come on. Give her a round of applause, everybody. I'm going to kill you. Yeah. That's fine. Just after you play. Now, repeat after me. Now, you're in a pub in Ireland, not in an orchestra. Enjoy yourself. Doesn't matter what your fingers or the notes are. It's how you play them, right. Play them with your heart. Play it like you feel it. If you feel it, they will. Do you love that instrument? - Yeah. - Then show them you love it, and then you'll have them wrapped around your finger. All right. Here we go, boys. That's it. All right. Hey! Well done! Well done, dear! Great stuff. Great stuff. Oh, you did great. I hope you'll come and join us again next week. There's a fiddler in there, and we need to let her out. You know the name, show what's inside in you. - What's your name? - Finley Sinclair. Finley. Now that means "fair warrior". No wonder you were brave enough to come on stage with us. Well, that's pretty interesting. What's my name mean, Seamus? Beckett, it means, uh, bee cottage or bee hive. Means you're probably descended from a long line of irritating pests. And wow! That was absolutely amazing. I've never heard anything like it. He plays with everything he's got. Not bad for a homeless old drunk, huh? I stand corrected. Wow, you are really beautiful when you admit that I'm right. - Did you plan this? - No, not at all. Okay. Maybe a little. Thank you. That was sweet. Sneaky, but still sweet. Finley Sinclair, you're actually not so bad when you decide to have some fun. You're not so bad yourself. - But we can't get involved. - No, definitely not. I couldn't possibly be a good guy. And I'm trying to be a good girl. And we don't even like each other. We're just too different. It would never work. It'd be impossible. Wow! Thank you. That was actually a lot of fun. But, um, we should probably keep tonight between you and me. I don't want you to get dragged into the public eye. Of course, probably just another meaningless kiss - for you anyway, so... - No, it... It wasn't. Trust me. I don't. Goodnight, fair warrior. Goodnight, bee cottage. Get in here. I saw that! What is going on with you two? You can't say anything to anyone. You kissed him? You did? You kissed him. I can't even barely still talk to him, and you kissed him. - My sister kissed Beckett. - Shh! Definitely keep this from my parents. It's rather obvious. You two have been all googly eyed for each other the last few weeks. But I'll keep it classified. Especially from Mom. What planet do you think I live on? A blind man could see that coming. Really, it's probably nothing. I mean, I don't even think he meant anything by it. Either way, this can't get out. If it does, there's no way he's still staying with us. And I don't want any late-night shenanigans. Your mother would have my hide. Would you look at that? They look good together. Finley, I'm warning you. I'll go to work if you don't have the money. You really showed him this time, still that dragon won't be back in any hurt. Oh, you can say that again, Arthur. Well, Steele, our dragon seems to have struck a deal with them whereby they are... What? Arthur, what? Spit it out! This place is super cool, one of my favorite spots. You gotta go under for good luck. Quick. Okay, so this is called the 'Miracle Pride'. - You had fun today? - Yes. So, what do you think about letting your tour guide take you on a date? Seems harmless enough. Well, it was either this or fish and chips at the pub, so. Wow, this is so much better. How did you do all of this? Well, I had a little bit of help from some friends. My lady. Hello. - Hi! - There you go. Thank you so much, Ciara. You are very welcome. - Have a good night. - Thank you, Ciara. See you guys. Well, bon app√©tit. You have to try this, okay. Just come here, come here. Trust me. All right. Make sure you're in there. Good? Yeah are you sure you know what you're doing? Don't worry about it. I grew up on these things, okay. Um, yeah, I... the problem is, I'm just... I don't really like heights. Heights? Here I come. It's not so bad, is it? - Yes, it is. - We're flying, Finley, come on. Oh, he's so good at this. I wonder why. Legs up, leg's up. Let it spin. There you go, you did it. Just don't look down. See. Okay. I got you. I got you. See, that wasn't so bad now, was it? No, it was fun. So, what do you want to do if you ever stopped acting? It's a waste of time to even think about it. It's not really an option for me. Well, what if it were? Maybe go to college, study history. I just want to live a normal life for once. Wouldn't you miss all your dragons? My love, you're injured. It's only a flesh wound from a dragon's claw. It will heal. I cannot say the same for your father's castle. You have defended it valiantly. I believe in you. I believe in us. I will fight for your love until the end of time. Cut! Print! Moving on! Taylor, very special. Thank you, my darling, you my frame. You are so money. Fantastic. How did you do it? You're 100% animal, 0% vegetable. Gorgeous. It's delicious. You taste of victory. I need a little sparkling water, please. I felt that, Beck. Thanks, Tay. You did great too. Very strong performance, son. Thanks, Dad. They were crying at the monitor. Seriously. Does that feel good? Yeah, it felt great. It should. Yeah, everyone's very impressed with your work. You have a lot of leverage right now. You should really sign those contracts. I guess. Hey, you're trending. Have you seen the article? No, I was busy. With your assistant? No. Just busy. Uh-hmm. Here it is. "Beckett Rush was spotted in Dublin. The heartthrob spent the evening with two models at the exclusive Emerald Lounge until Taylor Risdale showed up, discovered the tryst, and a cat fight broke out. R 'n R is officially on the rocks." Yeah, and my name is officially trashed again. Your movie sales spiked five percent. You should be thanking me. So, you know, things with the hippie guy are going interesting. Oh, and I'm still taking violin lessons from Seamus. Of course, he calls it the fiddle. Oh, next time you come, bring the fiddle. I'd like to hear if you're any good. Yeah, I will. Um... Mrs. Sweeney, I heard about what happened between you and your sister. No, stay out of my business. Well... I mean, you are just the grumpiest woman I have ever met in my entire life. I know something, you know, made you that way, right! And what they said you did is, well, it's pretty shady but... No, no. You know what, none of this makes sense. I know that you care about Fiona, so I'm gonna help you, no matter what. I don't want your help. Leave me alone. What? I'm dying. What? Cancer. I've only awhile to live. Why didn't you say anything? - Hey! - You're late. I know. But I just, I came from Mrs. Sweeney and... Let's just run the lines, okay. Please. Okay. Well, well, well, how is my son's lovely assistant doing? Um, I'm more of an acting partner. Oh, I used to be an actor. I mean, things have changed a lot since then. I think it's so kind how you sacrificed so much for Beckett's career. He was a natural. I mean, he needed to be in LA to make his dream a reality. I don't ever remember saying I wanted to be an actor. You did. "Dad, I want to be in movies" is exactly what you said. I was six years old. I also said I wanted to be an astronaut and a giraffe. Excuse me, Beckett, they're ready for you on set. I'll be right back, okay. Actually, I need to leave too. I could really use your help on this scene after we shoot. I need to do something for Mrs. Sweeney. Beck, we need you on set. Yeah. Sorry. Finley. Hey! You seem like a really nice girl. And I just don't want you to get your hopes up. This kind of thing happens all the time. What do you mean by that? I just suggest you keep things very professional with Beckett. He's with Taylor. Is he, that... I just... it doesn't really seem like he is. No, they'll be back together again very soon. Oh, okay. So, you manipulate his career and his love life? His love life is his career. So, if you really care about him... don't get in the way. - Seamus! Seamus, wake up. - Hey! No broom. No broom. Huh? Finley? What are you doing here? I need you to tell me where Fiona Doyle lives. What are you doing with those bickering old ladies? I need to help Mrs. Sweeney. Why? - No one else ever has. - I know, I know. And that's what I don't understand. Why does everyone hate her so much? Cathleen Sweeney. Cathleen was an absolute stunner. She was the best-looking girl in the town. And it was no surprise that she was able to lure Charles Sweeney away from her sweet little sister. When he died shortly after Cathleen had left him, the whole town blamed her and she had not a friend left. She was shunned by everybody, even by her own family. Now, no one wants the opinion of an old fiddle player. Between you and I, I think there was more going on. It just didn't add up, you know what I mean. Here, show me your map. Oh, I hate these things. Sorry. Look, she lives in a little farm just outside of town. Now it's a hell of a bicycle ride up the hill, but you never know, we might be able to figure something out. What time does Connor come by to pick up the empty kegs? He said he'd be here half an hour ago. He should be here any minute. Thanks. Have you come for the pig? Uh, no. Hi, I'm Finley Sinclair. I'm a friend of your sister's. I don't have a sister. Please wait. Cathleen's dying of bone cancer. She doesn't have much time. She got what was coming to her. Did she make you come here? No. She has no idea that I'm here. Cathleen ceased to be my sister the moment she went after that man. So now, good day to you. So, what? She's got only a few weeks left to live? I just... I don't know what to do. Now, Miss Sweeney won't talk, and Fiona won't listen. So, I'm stuck. Our latest post just reached a million likes. I forgave you. You know, it reminds me of that picture we took in Paris when we were 15. - Yeah. - Yeah. Hey Beckett, Taylor, they're ready for you on set. Thanks. Look, Finley, can we just talk later? Yeah, of course, yeah. Hey, look at all these articles about us. Beckett rushes back to Risdale. R 'n R returns. Beckett begs for Taylor to come back, and she does. This is very good for us. Finley! Finley, I called you like a hundred times. I'm trying to talk to you. I'm busy. Running. What? So, you just run away when things get hard? Not exactly a warrior. I thought it wasn't safe for you to be out here - without a disguise. - I'll be fine. Hey! We need to talk. - Please. - About what? You and Taylor hanging all over each other on social media? I told you it's not what it looks like. Okay, just trust me. Are you and Taylor together or not? - Hey! - Can we please have a picture? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. - Thank you. - All right. - Did everybody get one? - Bye, thank you, bye. Thank you, guys, see ya. Finley! Finley. Finely. I'm trying to work through all of this, okay. But this is bigger than just me. My life isn't always my own. I mean, my father, he has an entire team of people organizing my public life. You just don't understand, okay. I have no control. It doesn't answer my question. Are you and Taylor together or not? Our first film together didn't do so well. The studio was about to lose a lot of money. And then, my dad came up with this brilliant idea of a stormy relationship between Taylor and I. It started with a lot of truth. But then... my dad just started making things up. And before I knew it, I had this whole other persona. The worst part of it is, it worked. It saved the film. So, it is all fake. I can't be with a guy who has this entire made-up life. And I told you I can't do anything about that right now. I've always wanted to ask a girl to a dance. And this weekend, there's the St. Finian's festival. And I would love it if you would come with me. In public? Yeah. No disguises? No disguises needed, although I am pretty good at them. But this time, it would just be me and you. Okay. Here, let me get a picture. Okay. I'm good. Okay. And... smile. Emma! ‚ô™ When I woke up As I was all alone ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Hey-yah, hey-yah, hey ‚ô™ ‚ô™ With a broken heart And a ticket home ‚ô™ Look, Emma and Orla. ‚ô™ And I ask you now ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Oh, what would you do ‚ô™ Are you sure? What are we doing standing here? Let's go dance, come on. Come on, let's dance. ‚ô™ I've been All over this world ‚ô™ ‚ô™ Boys I ain't never seen Nothin' like a Galway girl ‚ô™ Okay. Now folks, we're very fortunate here tonight to have with us a lovely American girl who's a very fine violin player. But I have seen her develop over the last few months into becoming a great Irish fiddler. Finley, come up here and give them something to dance to. Come on. Get up here. Let's go for it. Two, three, four. Orla, come on. What a surprise to see you here without Taylor. Yeah, you know, I couldn't believe my luck when Finley said yes. She's pretty talented, wouldn't you agree? Yeah. Indeed. Yeah, you know what. You'll have to excuse me. I'm going to ask this young lady for a dance. May I have this dance? Yes, she says yes. Come on. Thank you, Seamus. They can hear your heart now. You better go back to your fella. I can see he's getting a bit lonely. - You wanna dance? - Do you wanna dance? Ma'am, can I have this dance? Can I have this dance? Wow, now that was a different girl up there. Well, thanks to a certain Irish tour guide. No, no, thanks to an old Irish busker who was the best teacher she could ever ask for. So, how is your Irish prom going? Perfect, but there's one thing I haven't done yet. What's that? Kiss a beautiful fiddler under a starry Irish night. Well, too bad, I played the violin. Close enough. Um... about four years ago after my brother got back he was helping at this refugee center in the Middle East and, uh... I guess he was just... at the wrong place at the wrong time. Oh. I'm so sorry. Alex had this peace about him though. He was so alive. I know it's probably a stupid idea, but, uh... I don't know, I thought if I could come here and see what he saw I could find what he had. Sorry I didn't mean to drop all of this on the dragon slayer. Hey, I'd like to think I'm a little bit more than that by now. Yeah, you are. Hey, you guys want to know where Beckett Rush is staying? Yeah, sure. Oh, no! - That's him. - That's him. He's coming. Beckett, who is this girl? Beckett? Is that your new girl? - What does Taylor think of this? - Get out of here. Are you sure you wouldn't like some tea? With blackberry scones. Or biscuits. That's very kind of you, but I think I lost my appetite. Taylor Risdale is in my house. Do you think maybe we should give them some privacy? Never! I've got to see this. It's ridiculous. You'd think they'd have enough pictures of me already. Right? This is a mess! What the hell were you thinking? What do you mean? We just went out for a night. What is so wrong with that? I'm trying to save his career before he pisses it away! I'm trying to have a life before you piss that away! All right, I think it's time to go to bed. Long day. Emma, Orla. Tea is here if you want it. Good night. All right. This is how I'm going to spin it, okay? Beckett Rush crashes a small Irish festival or whatever the hell it is. You have one too many drinks. You make girls' dreams come true by giving them kisses. That'll keep you wild, kind, and still with Taylor. The fans will eat that up. How can you do this to him? That's not who he is! And how long have you known him? You need to be quiet, and step away from things you know nothing about. Beckett, she doesn't know you the way that I do. - He's just try... - Finley. That's enough, okay? Son, you're the envy of the world. Why wouldn't you want that? He just does this to please you. Can't you see that? He just wants to have a normal life. - Maybe go to college. - Finley, just... just stop! You know what, maybe Taylor's right. Maybe you're never gonna understand! You're just his puppet. You don't even have the balls to stand up for who you really are. Hey, don't worry. Okay. She just can't understand our life. It's for the best. Will you guys just leave me alone right now? I'm telling you, I'm warning yous right now, get out of here. The lot of ya. - Thanks so much, Nora. - Well played, Nora. I really wish I didn't have to leave you guys. But you're never gonna have any peace with me staying here, so. We'll miss you. But you know you can come back and be my sous-chef anytime. Oh, Sean, I got you something. No more burnt hands, huh! I love them. Thanks, buddy. - Nora! - Oh, sweetheart! I'm gonna miss you, guys. Beckett, let's take a walk. I'm sorry, I'm working. I don't care. Come with me. Now. Ciara, Shenae, Logan, everyone down there, everyone in post and marketing in LA. All these people are your friends who work on the movie, they're here because of you. They depend on you. Your movies sell, which provides for their families. If you're not gonna do this for you or for me, at least do it for them. And Taylor. You've grown up together. You've been through a lot. She's the only person on this planet who truly understands what you've been through. It's just not like you to betray people. I'm so sorry. It's fine, no. It's fine. - It doesn't matter. - It doesn't matter. It's fine. It's fine. - Hello! - Finley, it's me, Seamus. Oh, hey, what's up? Can you come down to the pub as soon as you can, please? Uh... Yeah, sure. Hey, guys. Ah, there you are, Finley. So what's up? Give him a chance. Thank you, Seamus. Hey! Sorry about all that. I just didn't think you'd come if I called. I've been thinking about you. Your audition's next week. Yeah. Look, uh... I'm sorry about the other night. I screwed up. Please, just give me a little bit more time, and I'll figure all this out. If you wanna live this double life, I can't be a part of either one. Look, it's harder than it looks, okay. I'm just trying to protect you. I don't want you to expose yourself to the media, have your name dragged through the mud like that? - Do you want that? - Yes. If that's what it takes to be real. It's not just about me, okay! I have a lot of people depending on me, and I don't wanna let them down. Yeah. You know, Taylor was right. No. I don't know what I was thinking that this could work. But we can, okay. Come on. We can. You just gotta trust me. I tried. I mean, you're probably the first girl to ever break up with Beckett Rush. So why am I crying so much? You see, Finley, life rarely works out the way we plan it. You've got to learn to play the sorrow as well as the joy. They are linked, like day and night. You can't have one without the other. Give it a go. Very good. Good. Beautiful. Beckett's told me you broke it off. Are you suffering? - You saw him? - Uh-hmm. Make love, not war. Love, Beckett. Yeah. My little troubles seem petty compared to yours. I asked you. I want to know. He's a good boy. Yeah. It's hard to change. Mrs. Sweeney... what really happened between you and your sister all those years ago? I took my sister's fella. No, don't give me that. There has to be more to it. People would tell ya otherwise. Well... being here in Ireland has taught me to look deeper. Things aren't always as they seem. My father was a gambler. He'd bet on anything, horses, politics... the weather. Eventually, we were about to lose our house. It would've killed my mother. She... it had been in her family for generations. So, my father made a deal with Mr. Sweeney which had a very high price. Our family name meant something then. Charles Sweeney had money, but he had no social standing. My little sister didn't have many suitors. So how did you end up with Charles Sweeney? When Charles Sweeney drank, he got angry. He was violent. I had an eye for these things. He was clever. He left bruises where you couldn't see. So you took her place? You were protecting her, and she never knew. She thought I took him for the money. My sister was blinded with young love. How did Charles Sweeney die? People said I killed him. Did you? If wishes were bullets. Why didn't you just start over? When no one wants to hear, it's better to hide hide and be angry. Well, didn't I wear my anger like a grand fur coat! It all was for nothing. Wasted years! In the end, it's a choice, and I made the wrong one. - Hey. - Hey. I need a favor. So, you called me first? No. I tried everyone else. Last resort. Okay, what's up? Mrs. Sweeney told me the whole story. I have to get to Fiona's. Where are... Did you try riding up there in this rain? Maybe. Perfect day for a convertible. All right, I'll be there. Hey, we really need to talk to you. It's important. I have nothing to say to you. She's just trying to help, okay. Please, hear her out. Thank you. We just wanted to let you know that Cathleen isn't expected to live much longer. We've talked about the past some, her regrets. How could you steal a man away from your own sister? She tried to explain herself in the letters. Did you ever even read them? Why would I? Miss Doyle, your sister married Charles to protect you. He was physically abusive. How am I supposed to believe all this? Cathleen begged your father to drop the arrangement. But he was in too much debt, and Charles was too dangerous to cross. It was so humiliating. I'm really sorry about that. But your sister has been shunned for decades for trying to help you, and you won't even open - the letters that she... - Finley. Look, Miss Doyle... your sister's dying wish is that she would have your forgiveness. Please, just... come and see her. I think you two should be on your way now. - Hey! - Hey. Come in. What's up? Nothing. How are ya? Pretty tired. Yeah. So... are you seriously thinking about not signing that contract? I don't know yet. Beck. look, we... are in this together. You and me, we've... we're linked. Always have been. What you do impacts me. Please don't do this. After everything we've been through. We need this. Yeah. So, what are we supposed to do? Just sacrifice our whole lives? I don't know. It doesn't make any sense to me. So few understand this life that we made. Does she really know you the way I do? Think about it. I'll be in my room, if you wanna talk. Hey, Tay. Yeah? Would you ride your bike in the pouring rain just to help an old lady? Of course. But I wouldn't need to. Just hire a driver. I leave for New York tomorrow. It's crazy to think that this one audition is gonna decide the direction of my life. Yeah. If you'd got in the first time... you wouldn't be bugging me now. Yeah. I guess that's true. I'm glad you botched it. Mrs. Sweeney, I'm so sorry... that I couldn't get your sister to come. I really tried. I did everything that I could, but she just... she wouldn't listen. I trust you did. With everything that you did for your father and your sister, you are the bravest person I've ever met. You obviously haven't met many people. Just shut up. You wouldn't have said that a few months ago. Yeah, well... I guess Ireland is just full of surprises. Fact. Bye, sweetheart. Wind in your sails. Can I have a word? I'm not signing that contract. Here's the deal. I'll do one more film in the next six months. And I don't care how much money I make. I'm not doing this for me or for you. I'm doing this for the cast and crew so they can prepare for life after Steele Markov. That's my offer. Take it or leave it. As your manager... I have to warn you that this is the most asinine thing you've ever done. I don't need a manager right now. I need a father. So you think it's good enough? You are ready for your audition. Thank you, Seamus, for everything. Now go and make them stuck up music professors tap their feet. I will. That's okay, I'll get it. Emma, you take that. Here's some soda bread to bring to your mom. We would have made more, but we've been so busy. Nonstop calls from people wanting to stay in Beckett's room. Imagine that. Hello! Oh, hey. What's up? Did her sister ever come? So she's all alone? I have to go back. Did you forget something? What's wrong? I need to be somewhere else. Are you sure, Finley? Yeah. Am I too late? No. You're just in time. Cathleen, your sister's here. Cath. Fi. Oh, my God, Fiona. We're old. Yeah. Where's...? Finley, come and sit with us. Fi. We're okay now. Oh, my! So, you're back in town. Still driving this ridiculous convertible, I see. Yeah, I'm all ready for the next sunny day... in two months. I went to that cemetery. I told you I'd find it. Thank you, Beckett. Sorry it took me so long. I had to search everyone within a hundred miles of here. I guess I was wrong. Maybe I can trust you. Well, you still look gorgeous when you admit that you're wrong. So, what did you find? Well, four years ago, my brother drew this picture for this moment when I needed it most. I couldn't see it then, but... I was never alone. Well, sometimes things aren't always as they seem. So... I didn't sign the contract. What? I'm going to do one more movie just to help everybody out, but then next fall, I'm going to college. Well, girls' hearts will be shattered all over the world. Well, there's only one girl's heart that I care about. No more double-life either. Tomorrow, a story's going to hit social media, telling the world that Taylor and I are done. Finally! I'm happy about it because there's a fair warrior I wanna try and win back. I finished the last few weeks of my exchange program and went home. Where is it? I told the conservatory about Mrs. Sweeney, and they allowed me to audition after the deadline, one final time. I was accepted. Beckett visited. And of course, we crashed my old high school's prom. That summer, I went back to Ireland And helped Beckett with his lines on his last Dragon film. Beckett began college in New York. He's trying to be a normal guy, but he still needs his disguises. And, in autumn, at the conservatory, I played the violin. Or fiddle, as Seamus would say.
