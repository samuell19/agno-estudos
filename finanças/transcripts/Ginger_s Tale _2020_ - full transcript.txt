Follow me! *Sound* Let's run to the castle! Hurry! Hurry up! Nice flame! Yes.. ...the flame is nice! Maybe somebody is alive in there? It is time to put it out. There is nobody there! The Queen has been living alone for ages. Who would ever want to live with someone like her? Remember... something happened to her. She became greedy, cruel. She turned into a nasty shrew! All her servants left her! Not all! They say someone stayed with her. She is alone! Who would ever want to be with someone like her? No, she's got somebody! His name is- Who cares about- Look! Meow! Meow! Meow! A kitten! Up there! Oh dear! It is done for! Meow! Meow! Meow! Stop! Ouch! Hey! Where are you going?! You will burn to death! We need the firemen! Where are- our rescuers? Firemen!

What a brave girl! Atta girl! Brave and stupid - she could have burnt to death! She could have, nevertheless... she saved a life! I was scared to death! Ah!

When you get older - I'll take you on a team of... rescuers! Get the ladder to the castle! Pump it, pump it! A rescuer? She must stay home! Home? What the... home! The gal is like a fire! Not fire - Ginger! *LAUGHTER* Ginger... Look, here comes - your fill-belly again! Because we make a perfect couple! Look, he is a picture- of a cat! *Shrieck* Ooh! *Laughter* Well, Potter, looks like.. You're destined to carry her in your arms forever. Ahem- Guys! What are you building? What is this house?

He is a craftsman like we all are! Hurt Potter’s feelings for no reason! Potter will show his worth! He has already shown himself! He promised to finish the fountain - and never finished it! Why promise then? Why would anyone want to finish the fountain? He is doing it for everyone! So that? It looks nice! How does he know what "nice" is? Judging by his pots? He will finish it! Potter is a craftsman! When he buys a new pottery wheel, he will wrap it up. Wrap it up! Where will he get the money? He owes HALF THE TOWN! He owes us too, but we believe in him! He will pay everything back. Oh "yeah", he "will"... His great-granddad built our fountain when he was his age, and your Potter can only spout pots! Let’s go. There is no use in squabbling… Geez... Have we got anything to eat? Yeap... A good piece of cheese will set our mind at ease! *Laughter* You betcha! I always have something to eat! Did you cook it yourself? Grandpa did. I don’t keep house. Not in my style. Eh-h... *squeals* Huh? Hey, calm down, goofball! Shall we get it out? Maybe we shouldn’t? Maybe it’ll get out on its own? It’s shrieking so loud... What are you waiting for? We must save her! Let’s get the firemen. They’ll get it out. It’ll scream itself hoarse by the time they are here! Can’t you hear it’s suffering? Ouch! What’s going on?! Oo-o-o-o-uch! Where is it coming from? From above! Oh! Here's my precious! GINGER! Geez, goddamn it! Let's go home, my sweet little piggy... Goddamn this fountain! Again! Why did you get the pig into the fountain?! There you go - just look at it! She ruined the fountain! Ginger is just a trouble-maker... Who will hold responsibility for it? Is the pig alright? The pig is, but you aren’t! You’ve ruined half the town! Leave her in the well! Why did she even fret about that pig? But it’s alive! Where are you running now, goddamn you! Stop, stop immediately! Quickly, go after it! It is just useless! Time to go. Ginger... Everyone must do their bit of work. What do you do? You only make things worse. But I do – I rescue. You don’t rescue anybody, you ruin everything! How many times have you tried to ruin the fountain? Hm-m... Five? How many?! Fiv… fifteen… And how many times I told you… You should have given me a job in your team! You promised! Well… promised… e-erm… But I can’t! You are too young! Well, my birthday soon is in three days! Agrh! Do you really think the fountain should be finished? I think, yes… Yes! I think it’s good as it is... No. Look… There should be a figure, petals, and more. Can you see? It’s supposed to be much higher! And the water is to run from the top over the petals so that it looks like seamless waterfall! Then the structure will be more solemn. It’s a fountain after all... ...and not a chamber pot. Your great-granddad is said to make it out of red clay. I guess it is special. Do you believe in me? I do. You got this! With solemn waterfalls! We just have to find some red clay. There is no red clay. These are just stories told by your granddad, Archivist. GINGER! What have you done again?! Grandpa!.. I have to go… Ag-h-h! Ouch! Where was I heading? I’m going senile... Oh! Ginger! Stop right there! I will lock you at home with that fat cat of yours! And will never let you out! I solemnly swear that I’ll do it! *Murmuring* What? I can’t hear you! Gyah! *Heavy breath* My flap is broken! It’s your problem! Have you found the flintstone? No... What is stopping you? OOOPS... You’re so very strong and smart. Or have I misjudged you? I am not lucky, that’s it! I am not lucky, because you are an oaf! I will find it for you! I just need more time... Time?! Look at me! I am running out of time! Oh... Arcs! Of course! I have been looking for it for eight years! I will find it! You know, Your Majesty, I will do everything… for you… The elevator, shower, sewers! I even synthesized the dog fire! But it doesn’t make money! Why do I need the fire that can’t make money? Did you think of it? I know how to find the flintstone! I don’t have to dive! I’ll devise a new system! System... Ааааааh! Ааааh! Find the flintstone! Before somebody else finds it... Why are you so blue? Money! You need money again? That’s not a problem! Of course we will help you! How much? I don’t… don’t want to borrow… *laughter* …money from you! I am here to pay you back! I have paid everyone back! Everyone! And now it’s time to turn money back to you! Here is what I owe you! Thank you my friends! Grandpa! Open the door right now! Never! You are grounded! It is not fair! You cannot do this to me! Watch me do it! You are my granddaughter and I am responsible for you and your actions! You could never understand me! I was rescuing a pig! And I am rescuing the town! That’s it! Today you’re staying at home! You’ve found it! Yes, I have! You’ve found red clay! Sure! And also red, yellow, green! I found everything! I am being serious – how did you manage to pay back? Ok, ok! Jokes aside… I found treasure! Treasure? Pirate’s treasure! Do you know that pirates used to navigate our river? What do you mean? Very slowly... On rafts! *Laughter* Potter! Stop joking! It’s not funny! Come on, smile! It is funny! Don’t want to tell me – then don’t! Wait! Ginger! Oh well... You always calculate everything… But you’ve miscalculated my granddaughter. You messed with her head. What do you mean? That’s what I mean. The girl is from a decent family but she runs around saving everyone she can lay her eyes on. You promised to recruit her as a rescuer! And you raised her! I don't know how to raise children. She should be gentler. She is a girl after all. And this Potter… Potter… I never invited him. I don’t need any pots. Do you remember his great-granddad? He was a real craftsman! Look at the fountain he made! Ha! You lost. Again! *Laughter* Trickster! You distracted me! I will never play with you again! *Giggle* And… Here! Here comes… Faster! Your Majesty! System OOOPS-88. It shows everyone and everywhere! Why do you name everything OOOPS? Is it a desease? It is an abbreviation. OOOPS means Advanced Spyglass System. Model 88. High-precision mechanism! Coated glasses! I can’t see anything. Maybe your eyesight has deteriorated? Can’t see those who are right under your nose... Moron! My eyesight is fine! Why do you think somebody has already found the flintstone and we might see smoke or fire above the town? These gizmos of yours aren’t working! You are mistaken, Your Majesty. All my gizmos work perfectly well. I should call you not OOOPS… But PUFF! Because that is what your inventions are. It… It’ll take years to dig it up! How I…! O-ouch! It’s getting on my…! What do I need clay for when I’ve got… money? I’ll buy a kiln! Haaa-haaa-haaaa! And a new pottery wheel! Aha!.. Now I see. There are two of you! *Coughs* Now, now… Now… Your Majesty! OOOPS... do you think I’ve got another life? Why? Because you are of no use in this life! The flintstone! Quickly! Go there! Sulphur dioxide, methane... The peasants are burning manure! OOOPS, it is the smell of money! My money... Universal Mobile System «OOOPS-103»! The latest development! The horse speed and power! Innovative suspension! Tires made of high carbon rubber! Triple springs two for each arm! Shock absorbers, adjustment system for- Turn to the smoke! To the left! But the road… To the smoke, I said! It’s a delicate mechanism… I… Faster! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! Ouch! The tyres… have burst! A fractu-u-ure in the… spring! Suspension… a-ah! Don’t touch the catapu… Aaaaaah! OOOPS! Why are you never near when I ne-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-d… To-o-o-o, to-o-o-o-o la-a-a-ate! Your Majesty... It’s dirty! Ha-ha... You look gorgeous! Am I a joke to you? It’s just silver. It isn’t enough! I need the flintstone! I found another one... Give it to me! These are for you... I got you some flowers! Put them in the vase. I want to apologize for the mess... I broke… Ginger, wait, wait a second. Let me… I have to… finish. Sorry. You’re inspired, I will not distract you, finish it. Wo-o-aw… Look at that! Are they new? You really found red clay! Here! *Giggle* Awesome! Is it a new pot design? It’s a fountain... Of course, a fountain it is! It looks beautiful. A real decoration of the town... A decoration? Em-m... All your works have something in common. Of course! Who wouldn’t recognize a pot! But my granddad always surprised everyone. No matter what he made, people admired it. When he finished the fountain, everyone just stood there the whole day looking at patterns. And what am I?! I will never be able to make anything beautiful! I believe in you, Potter! I believe in you! You… You... I am a pot craftsman. You just look at Pricker ‘s suits! Shoe ‘s shoes! Hatter’s hats! And I...! Are you jealous? Yes! I am! Of their talent and skills. I’ve got talanted friends, but their friend is a loser! We’re leaving you alone. Leaving! Doesn’t matter. They will envy me really soon. All of them. OOOPS... do you know why you are OOOPS? Huh… why, Your Majesty? Because you are an awful rattle-brained person! In other words – an idiot! But that’s not OOOPS. That is OOOPS. That is you. What if… like this? If we appeal to logic - smoke is a proof that somebody used the silver dog. One more strike with the flintstone and there will be fire! Where we have fire – there we have a fire! We will see it for sure! Nobody stops after the silver dog. It is possible after the copper dog… As I told you… If you had- Shut up, OOOPS! Where are we supposed to see this fire?! Ah! A fire! Quickly! Follow me! Let’s go! A fire! Hey! Where is the fire? Look, something is burning... Where is the fire? Nowhere! What is on fire? Nothing! Mind your own business! The Potter’s house is on fire! It is my business too! Ginger! For Christ’s sake! What are you doing?! Horse! Barrel! The fountain! You are being too nice to her! We should tie her up! A-ah! Buckets, hooks! Follow me! Let's go-o! Ouch! What is wrong? Where are you taking me?.. The fire is there! What’s got… Into you?! It’s tyranny! You have no right! You have all left, haven’t you? And me? Have you locked me up again? No way! I will not stay here! By no means! That’s it! The house is gone. Poor Potter... Damn… The longer you go the less you have to do! Neither home, nor job. Pots don't burn. Stop it already! The chap is in distress. What happened here? Potter’s got a little trouble. Just a teeny-tiny one... Oh dear... No kidding… Come and stay at my place until you’ve got something of your own. Why your place? Let him stay with me. Don’t even argue! He is coming with me. Let’s go. Just stop it! All of you! Potter may stay with all of us in turns. Well, Let’s go. It’s getting colder. As for the house… we’ll build it. You’ll start your business again. It isn’t exactly rocket science. Huh! Where is Potter? Your Potter is just fine! He left with his friends. You should go too. We’ve got good friends. There are no good people! There are plenty! And Potter is the best! What makes him the best? Has he got any money? Wealth? Glory? Power? He doesn’t need any of those. Ehe-he... Everyone does. Potter and the Queen alike. It’s not true! I don’t know about the Queen, but Potter lives for people! He works for their sake and even wants to finish the fountain! It is glory that he wants! And money. Lots of glory and lots of money! It is not true! He as well as all people in this town want the same thing! They’re all hungry for wealth and power! All our townsfolk are remarkable! They are sincere and unselfish! Come to my birthday in three days and see for yourself! I’ll be happy to see you! What a stupid girl... Or course you may stay at Ginger’s house, but Archivist will never let you in. He will let you in. But he won’t let you out in one piece. By the way, Ginger’s birthday is coming! I am going to make her a hat. The most beautiful hat! With a feather! And I am going to make her red boots. Because she is Ginger! As for me I’ll make her a fire-fighter jacket. And then we’ll dance polka! Ha-ha! Because of the hat with a feather? Don’t be ridiculous? She'll tap dance with me! In the red boots! The fire-fighting jacket…. That is the real thing! So the first dance will be mine. Rescuer’s tango! No! Ginger… she is my… She and I… Because I…her… On her birthday, she will waltz. With me. Is it clear? How are you? Are you fine? I am. I am going to stay overnight at Hatter’s. How about you? I am fine to-o-o-o! Grandpa! Muah! Muah-muah-muah! Dear grandpa! Tell me: how do I arrange a perfect party for my guests? I want to do everything on my own. Guests? You want to have a party all by yourself?! I do! Yes, of course! So that everyone is… *laughter* Well… The formula is easy! Tidy up the house, decorate it, make some cakes, invite musicians… "Housekeeping", the sixth shelf, the seventh book on the left! A-ah!.. How beautiful! Grandpa, let’s first decorate it and then tidy it up? Knock it off, Ginger! Time to go to bed! I’ll do it myself! On my own! Sit. I just have to put some oil and light them up! Why are you lightening them? Now? When am I supposed to light them if not at night? Ginger! Not Ginger, Sunshine! - Lots of sunshine! Phew... You’re just in time! Ginger, can I take the horse? Of course… I… Me… And now time for cleaning! Ginger! Go to bed! Many people underestimate the role of a hat in an outfit. But they’re all wrong. It is not just a head-dress. Your head-dress determines thoughts in your head. Just calm down and take a seat! I’ll make a hat for Ginger and she’ll be a real hero in it. You think so? Absolutely! The head-dress determines the person. If you wear a bucket hat, you won’t stop drooling. A shady hat makes you look romantic. If you wear a top hat… everyone can see you’ve got money! *Laughter* This hat is for fun. A masquerade. To make people laugh. Whoa-a-ah! What was it? I have no idea. But it is very funny. OOOPS, my dear OOOPS... you’re so inventive… You’re an outstanding scientist! You’re practically a genius! You’re the greatest mind in my whole kingdom. Why can’t you steal the flintstone!? I’ve never learnt to steal... Then go and learn! If you want to stay in the castle. Wait up! I wanted to tell you that you’re the best musicians in this town! And the only ones! *Giggle* That is why you’re the best. Please, come to my birthday party. As musicians. And as guests. When is it? The evening after tomorrow. Everyone will be there. Feast, jokes, laughter, ginger lights! And you will play? Deal? Okey-dockey~ Please, without lights! You’re just enough! I am mature now and I have steadied down. You sort them out and let’s get them to the market tomorrow, okay? Uh-huh… And a day after tomorrow we’re going to Ginger’s! Look at the present I’m making for her. What do you think? Are they beautiful? Meh… They are just boots. You don’t say so! Footwear is the most important part in a person! Shoes determine whether you follow the way you’ve chosen. What if your boots don’t fit you properly? You won’t reach your destination! If shoes are a perfect fit the sky is the limit! I mean – the road. I think Ginger will love them! What are you going to give her? A po- Yes! A pot! Of course a pot! What else can I make? You are all so pompous! One has made loads of hats, another - a pile of shoes! What is…? What has got into you? Nothing has got into me... Very well then. Don’t throw the shoes! Be gentle with them, with love. What? Who is there? Let’s not be lazy! You should not just play but dazzle everyone with your talent and virtuosity! Uh... Talent is exactly what we’ve got. So! What’s this noise? It’s Ginger again! What on earth is this? …Unleash the dogs now! Y-your Majesty! Careful… Up! Your Majesty! Where is the flintstone? It's right here! Are you jocking on old lady? I don’t find it amusing... I will annihilate you! Do you want... that the whole town... find out about the flinstone? Anyone can see the flintstone! If anyone lays their hands on it... I must have the flintstone tomorrow! Can’t you see, I have no time or money left... On the plus side, you’ve got a perfect ear for music! No… no… no! All wrong! Let’s start again… …On the count of two! What does it mean? I have no idea… Let’s start from the beginning! Are they torturing a cat!? So! Where is your dog fire? There's is! No! Are you crazy!? Yes! You can’t! We will burn alive! Your Majesty, this… This fire burns through rock as if it were paper! You can turn it on only if the tanks are connected to the system! Which system? Unified Redistributive System! OOOPS-66! I use the town utility services to control water, air and fire distribution all over the castle and even the town from my workshop. For example. Look here, Your Majesty! I connect the tank with compressed air to the system. Hmm! Rewire... and now townsfolk have got not water... but puff in their taps! Air! *Laughter* And now, the town fountain may... What about the tanks? Of course! They are full of fire! But it can’t make money... I can’t find another use for them. I will. Everyone will be happy. *Laughter* If anybody survives. My friends! You all know me! And you love me! I am inviting all of you to my birthday party tomorrow! There will be lots of yummy cakes! Ginger! Your dough seems to be running away! O-ops... Clothing is like our second skin. I would even say – the first. Nice clothing makes people beautiful. Comfortable clothing makes people happy! It’s coming out nicely. How do you think – will Ginger like it? I don’t know. How can I know what she might like? I don’t understand… Why does she have to like everything you make? Who are you talking about? And who are you talking about? If you are good at everything you do then you think you may treat me this way? What are you talking about? Just as Ginger is our friend, so you are! No, I am not… I am different! Listen. Stop yelling at me! Or else I might get hurt! I’m already doing it! Getting Why don’t I get peeved at you? Why hurt? I might not just get peeved, but become really mad! I am already doing it! Forget it. I've lost my temper. Um. That’s okay. More so as it isn’t my best piece of work... How do I zoom it in? Where is the flintstone? Do you even realize that without it I am doomed? My life is running out! Look at all that! That is the girl of stupid Potter! Now they are in possession of the flintstone. And soon the whole town will know about that! Rascals, swindlers, scallwags! They will pass the flintstone around! They all used to be my servants! Pathetic meanlowlife! How I hate them all! Get lost! I’ll do everything myself! Without any help! The more so as now I have the invitation. Well, I’ll do everything myself as well. You’re lucky, you are… …ginger, everyone loves you. No one is expecting anything from you. You’re just a cat. But I am a genius! Unappreciated by others, especially the Queen! But wait, I’ll prove it to her! Where are the pies? Here you are, Granny! Nice to see you’ve made it! I’ll introduce you to everyone! I don’t want to be introduced to anybody! Look, here are our wonderful friends! This is Shoe, here is Hatter and this one is Pricker! There is nothing they can’t do! Has Potter arrived yet? We haven’t seen him. He’ll come. He will… Where are you going? Granny, let me introduce you to my Grandpa! I am not a granny at all! And I don’t need your Grandpa! Where is your Potter? He will come no matter what! These are the dwellers of our town. Widely different but as I told you, sincere and selfless people Look at their happy and smiling faces! Have you seen Potter? So where is your “best of them all”? I’m sure he is on his way! Potter is so kind… And strong… He and I… Here he is! Ginger! Happy Birthday! Hello! I want to wish you on your birthday to be always... Waltz! On the count of two… Ginger! Look! Novelty of the season… Hats with feathers! Neither rain nor ado will destroy your hairdo! A beautiful boot for a beautiful foot! Made of leather – to withstand all weather! These dresses are the best, from now till the rest... U-u-h… So crafters? Shoe, why are you so silent? Can you make boots like these? Yours shoes don’t even come close to these! Just look at the hats! Look Hatter! Can you imagine what thoughts come to mind when you wear a hat like this? Great ones! Not to be compared with those that come up under this hollow top hat! And the dresses.. Pricker! Look here! Velvet, crêpe de Chine, silk, brocade! That’s a job well done, but by someone other than you! What do you say? These were made by real craftsmen! As for you, You are good for nothing! Who is that? Don’t you recognize him? No… Was that Potter? I haven’t recognized him. Where did he get all that? Ginger! I want you to take off these lousy shoddies and put on truly beautiful pieces of work! That is exactly what I am wearing! And you… you... Erm… What’s with this masquerade? I don’t get it! Where are my troopers? These are dumb mannequins! Well… What “well”? Where are my brave warriors and heroes?! They’ve... ...turned into morons! Models! I’ll make scarecrows out of you! What’s got into you? Why are you yelling at them? They walked the runways nicely! Now they will run nicely! Then crawl nicely! Double time ma-a-a-a-arch! Time to go Come, come! Everything has turned into madness! As always. Ruined the party. Potter put on a barbed show with presents! Nothing is ever right when Ginger is around! Keep going. Let’s get out of here Haven’t even tried any pies Haven’t enjoyed the music Maybe he was joking? Potter and sense of humour? Have you seen his pots? What did you say? You think it is a masquerade? Let’s see what you’ll say about the final touch then! Why did he treat us like that? Something is wrong with Potter. I'm telling you. Hear-hear! "When you wear a hat like this..." And look at what he got! Ridiculous rubbish! "My shoes... ...don't even come close to those." Where did he get... ...all that? He has always been a loser! What's the meaning of all that? This... ...is magic! Huh? Who is that? A clown, maybe. Potter invited him... ...to entertain the guests. It is full of ancient wisdom, you can never find in book! Mysteries and incantations, spooky mojos, tons of spells! Blessing, love and suffering, it can give you anything! It affects your innermost, it can make your brain burst! Magic does it all! Ma-a-agic! White and black! And even green! Magic can do anything! Magic! Ma-a-agic! Red and blue! Yellow with dotty flecks! Magic can do anything! Magic can do anything! No peace during the day nor at night! I am not a clown! I am the greatest Magician... ...and Spell-weaver! As for Potter. He is bewitched! By who? It doesn't matter! What really matters is that if the curse isn't lifted, he might die! That explains a lot. That explains everything! How do we break the spell? Only I can do it! But! YOU must get into his house! Incognito... Then you must hide... How do we have to get in? Incognito, i.e. unnoticed. That's very important. You must get in, wait until Potter falls asleep... ...and take the flintstone off his neck. Flintstone! You must bring it to me. And I will break the spell and free Potter! Oh... What do you mean by "get in"? Let alone incognito! Here! Oh well! OOOPS 207 Universal Perforating System! It... It is magic!.. It is science! Here! Why? What for? Because it is the best present anyone has ever given to you! Why did you hurt your friends? Did you want to humiliate them? But why? They've got nothing to do with it? I wanted to show you That I am the best! The best because the things you can't make you can buy with money? What's wrong with that? I can buy their shop... and sell it together with them! But I'm not doing it! Do you see that red lever? Is there an easier way to take the flintstone from Potter? No, there is not. Can you see the red lever there? So? That is OOOPS 208! Self-Sufficient Tunneling Operation! The machine will take you there on its own. After you take the flintstone from Potter, get back in... ...and pull this lever down and the machine will... ...take you back. That's it! I'll be waiting for you ...here. Did you get it? We got it! What's this wheel? A-ah! I told you not to touch anything else! I would say he is a clown after all! Hey! A-heey! Guys! Are you alive? Are you there? Are you with me? Oh... How embarrassing. Seems like I am a clown. Not a funny one. Poor guys... To hell with the shop! I can buy the whole market! What is wrong with you? Nothing! I am perfectly well! You’ve changed! And what’s wrong with that? On the contrary – it’s great! Take the tree! I don’t need your money tree! I needed you. But now… What «but now»? Now… you’re not as you used to be! As I used to be?! What did I use to be? Down trodden loser, is that who you need? Have forgotten how others mocked me? How they reproached me for not being able to finish the fountain! And now I can buy it! I can buy a fountain that will immortalize me in this town! You’re proud of what you can buy not of what you can create? You’re proud of not yourself but of the money that you haven’t even earned! You should start all over! Find red clay! What are you talking about! Forget these fairytales! It doesn’t exist! Doesn’t! Do you understand? It doesn’t exist! Doesn’t exist?! Doesn't...? She is no match for you… You gave her such… wonderful presents! And she couldn’t appreciate them. Presents like these can only be appreciated by the Queen. I keep telling her… Don't tell her! Tell the Queen! You are so rich... Why don’t you become a King? You could do people a lot of good and make them happy! A King... Why not? You’ve got money. Now you can get the power! You’ll be able to help everyone! I thought... Yeah, you thought a lot of things. That you had friends and a girl… You should go to the Queen! That’s where true happiness is! Yours! I am a good for nothing inventor. I am ballast… A waste of space! I am vacuum! Don’t make a mountain out of a molehill, OOOPS. You just had bad luck! Your Majesty! You are beautiful! I know. A bride should be beauty-ful. A bride? Are you… getting married? Ah! A woman would do whatever it takes to find happiness! Who is your chosen one? Ha-ha-ha! Potter. You know him. Potter? Ahem... Aah… Of course! He’s got the flintstone! Well then, I’ll arrange a festive- I don’t want any feasts! Devise me bright colourful water so that it glows. And fill the fountain with it. I’ll have a water extravaganza at my wedding! Let the whole town enjoy and be happy! ...For the last time. That was the final straw! She's ruined the fountain! We must capture her and lock her up! Get her! The fountain?! It can't go on like this! Come with us! Ha! She's running to Potter's! No, we shouldn't go backward. Keep going ahead! Where ahead? Are we near his house yet? Then we must stop! We will stop when we are supposed to! I'm telling you, turn it around! I'll turn YOU around now! It'll stop when it has to! Shoe, stop wheezing! And don't breathe like this! And stop yanking at it! The clown told us not to touch anything in here! I'm not touching anything! You are! No, I am not! Sit tight then! I am! And stop wheezing in my ear! What are you doing here? I didn't invite you! How did you get here? What's going on Potter? What's the matter with you? You are a crafter! You must work! You must finish the fountain! Others should be proud of you! They all will be proud of me! I am working! And you're getting in the way! Working? But your wheel is clean and the kiln is cold! Don't touch it! A dog! A real dog! Where did you come from, little chap? It isn't real! It's a special dog! For work! Didn't you want me to work? Give it to me! You're scaring it! It's trembling! Why is it wearing a collar? It doesn't let it breathe properly. What have you done! You are not welcome here! Why are you always ruining everything?! Why can't you mind your own business? Who allowed you to touch my flintstone?! You know what? This dog was just as useless as you are! Make yourself scarce with that lousy dog! We've had just enough! Why did you destroy the fountain? There is nothing sacred for you! These are all just jokes to you! Why are you even listening to her? Let's throw her out of the town! Hear-hear! Get out of the town! Stop destroying it! Off you go! Go away! The Queen! Are you the Potter? Yeeaah... Your Majesty. Drop the formalities. Call me Filaura. Potter! There's something important I'd like to discuss with you. I heard you wanted to become the king right? Yees... Yes. Absolutely. Ha-ha-ha! I say "yes"! You really are the worthiest of the worthiest! The day of our wedding will be announced later. I'll be waiting for you in the castle, honey. Did all of you hear that?! I'm marrying the Queen! You've destroyed the fountain! You will never be a rescuer. Never ever! I'm supposed to be saving people from elementsnoy from you. This place has become so off-putting. Some strange animals come up from nowhere! *Screams* Small dogs like this grow into monsters! Not just monsters. There is a fire-dragon under the town! They say, it lives under the ground and it's going to eat us all soon. They say, buildings have already started collapsing! What a wonderful day! OOOPS! Is everything ready for the wedding? Yes. What about blazing water for the celebration? 200 barrels. Does it shine? Glows... Let’s discuss the plan of the ceremony again. First, we go over the bridge, then – into the tower. There Potter takes the crown and sits on the throne. And the most important part - as soon as you see that Potter has the crown you demolish the bridge, lock the doors- and shutters in the castle! Remember? And only after that you let your blazing water into the town! The feast begins! Into all pipes! All of them! Under the tower and into the town fountain! Got that? Why do I have to demolish the bridge? It’s my whim! I’m going to burn bridges behind me! Stop asking stupid questions! I want to be left alone with my fiance! That’s how I want it! Nobody can get in the way! How we leave later, I’ll decide it later… And no questions! As you wish... Your Majesty. You should eat something... Go and take a walk... Well... Maybe read something. Maybe you want me to read to you? As we used to do, do you... remember? Ginger! Ginger... How's she? Do you read…? No. I used to read it to her when she was little. «The Tale of the Red Clay». You keep reading fairy-tales... A game of chess? What? Do you remember how to play? I do. I saw Potter. He went to the Queen to ask for her hand in marriage. He is a big shot now. Soon he’ll be the king! Ginger!? What’s wrong, my dear girl? What are you doing, my sweetie? We don't need these pots! It is a fact! Nobody needs them! Calm down! I am calm! I am terribly calm! Forget about the pots... And about hat Potter… The king – no big deal! I have already forgotten about him! Flint... Stone? The flintstone is temptation itself. Temptation? It’s nearly gone... Uh… First comes the copper dog - it's a source of copper coins. It rids the master of the need as long as he can stop. Copper dog... The silver dog will block the sky with smoke and in vile envy shall be drowned the miserable flintstone’s master, unless- he summons the dog setting everything ablaze! Ablaze? Everything? The dog! He’ll be devoured by insatiable greed for gold... Another problem! He’ll feed on money! Otherwise, he’s dead at once. He’s going to die! …Are you going? Finish reading! The last flintstone’s secret… Another secret? Fire dogs! They’ll burn everything down! The secret!... What is it?! That's it. Entries in the book break off... Listen! The flintstone! I know that legend! Well, I used to know... My memory is failing me… Try to remember! What else might happen? What is the secret? I can’t remember... I read it when I was young… Where did you read it? In the library? In the square by the new fountain. I was holding the third page... I remember splashes going my way... Wind... Splashes... The page was all wet and it got destroyed. But I managed to read it! Let’s go to the fountain! You will remember! The fire will purify everything! This town with its stupid vassals and back-scratchers who left me alone! And the flintstone will be mine! So, here does this hose go?.. Ah, here! Who is that Potter? Moron! Lousy, good-for-nothing looser! He thinks he can be a king! *Laughter* So he gets in the tower, takes the crown and that’s when he faces his death! A king! For a minute. His last minute! That’s it! You’re done for! You’ll perish in the flame, Your Majesty! King Potter! No one will ever heard anything about this third-rater! Brighter than the sun will this show be! The World will turn to dust instantly! Those who betrayed me! Who left me all alone! Will fall down at my feet as ash! Submissively! May they all go down in flames! This moment will be priceless! I’ll repay them all with interest! The fire of my vengeance- Will kno-o-o-ock on every do-o-o-or! Ginger! She did it again! She’s a catastrophe, not a girl! What happened to the water? Well, she couldn’t possibly drink it all! You can never know with her! We must throw her out of the town! And say goodbye to her! Well hello my future king! Hello… Fi... la... I mean, Your… fi... Fijesty… I mean, jesty… urm… I could listen to this forever… Come in, My dearest. You may go, OOOPS! But maybe... OOOPS, you are no longer needed here! That Ginger is nothing but trouble! What's going on here? Her granddad is here… Where is he? Over there! Think! But I can't! There were splashes! Splashes?.. You’ll get your splashes! What are you doing?... I’ve just remembered! And forgot… Again… Allow me to help you with that… Let’s straighten it here and here. Oh my darling... Thank you, Your Majesty. Soon you’ll be the Majesty too. And together we will rule this town! May she be happy. And I’ll disappear. I am not the flintstone! I am just… just… OOOPS! There is just one ritual left. It is an ancient coronation ceremony. The future king must take the crown himself! My darling. Go and take your crown. And leave the flintstone here! I’ll keep it for you. …How do you… You can’t go through this ritual having any objects related to fire! Don’t worry, you’ll get it back… My king! Right after the ritual.. Why do you want to kill him!? Youuu?! Kill him?! Ha-ha… Potter… she’s luring you into a death trap! My darling, look at this ridiculous… ...blind jealousy! Let’s go back Apparently, she… to the town, to our friends. By taking you to the place… …where nobody appreciates you. The Queen wants to kill you! I want everyone to know... You must not enter the tower! You shouldn’t take her crown! What a wonderful person Potter is! He doesn’t have to be a king for that! The world works in such a way that only power can give …Potter what he longs for. It’s not true! Only when you become the king… She is tricking you! ...you get respect and appreciation of your shining talents. Tricking! Do you hear?! Why do you believe her? It is not like that! Don’t believe her! Don’t believe me, Potter. Don’t. You do the math. Remember, my darling, who you used to be. And imagine who you will become! Pot-te-e-e-er! That’s a li-i-i-ie! I just want everyone to admire you! Ginger... Get out of here, now! When I become the king, I’ll take care with you. I told you – everyone cares for wealth and power! Granny… You don't believe me... You don’t! I don’t understand what’s… What’s going on? No one understands anything at all here! Come on, think! I can’t remember! Trouble is brewing! Try to remember! What’s going to happen? Why is our Fireman fussing around? We must save ourselves! I remembered! What? Otherwise, why is he so worried?! I remembered how to play dominoes! He isn’t worried… He is panicking! That’s it! Dead-end! We are doomed, doomed! A-ah, it is locked! Filaury! What have you done!? What is so special about that clumsy girl? Everyone’s turned their backs on her. The throne is yours! You wanted it so much! You will have everything! Everything! Just give me the flintstone! Okay, okay... run towards your death! You may both burn alive! And let the whole town burn down! Fire! What’s going on! Run for your lives! Aaah, don’t know! The buildings are burning! A-a-ah it hurts! Help! Get out of here! Hurry! To purify… To purge oneself from… Clean... No... Yes...! No! No! No-o-o! How very romantic Your Majesty! To get burnt with love. Ha-ha-ha-ha… That’s it! …The end! Come on! Yo-heave-ho! Come on! That’s it! …We’ve run out of water! Get the car to the river… Hurry! What did we do to deserve it? Ow! Oh my…! Everything! Everything will burn down! Everything is on fire! We’ll be left out in the streets! Ouuuh, somebody help! Aaaah…! And the castle is burning! Ginger… breathe! Hold on… … hold onto me! Rusty, how did you get here? I’ll help you! Fire behind you! We’re all going to die! I can’t breathe. Get out of at all here! Where? The fire is everywhere! Come here! Closer! Oh! Look, who is there?! Ginger? Is that Ginger? What is she doing there?! That’s her for sure! She’s saving somebody… Saving? Us? Ginger wants to save us! Ginger? She’s saving us!

Don’t you recognize them? What wedding? We don’t have our tailcoats! Aaah! Nor our heads! Nor invitations... I remembered! I remembered! I remembered the mystery of the flintstone! You may resist its temptation only if you completely deny envy and greed! But only a pure soul is capable of that! Well, why are you so confused… Go find your new friends! That’s what was written on the third sheet... I told you - you can raised children! We don’t need it any more! What are you going to do without your fire? You are my fire!
