(birds chirping) (footsteps tapping) (tense music) - [Man] I don't have to see the fear in their eyes. I can feel them cringing. I can feel them shrinking from my face, my one and only, old, unfortunate face. What they never see is the beauty behind my eyes. They only see the (mumbles)... (pleasant music) (rattling) (rattling) I've had the nerve to fall in love a thousand times, and every day, somehow it always makes me feel subversive. (water splashing) were I not so far beyond mere ugliness, I might wish to be handsome, handsome guys can get away with murder. (birds chirping) (pedestrians chattering) (footsteps tapping) Mine is the face that spoils a sunny day. Luckily I don't need a tan. She's late. (cheerful music) (footsteps tapping) (doors clattering) (engine revving) If only they knew me. If only they knew the love that I contain, it could be theirs, for but a single word of kindness. A love that would astound them all, that would overwhelm them from the dandruff of their darling scalps to the blisters of their burning feet. If only they knew me, they would love me. But they don't know me, they don't. So screw 'em! (hinges creaking) (eerily pensive music) - Good morning Dr. Heckyl! - Good morning Miss Pertbottom. - Good morning Dr. Heckyl. - Oh, good morning Miss Nietkiester. (chuckling) - You have nothing to fear! Acutickling is totally safe! Now acupuncture and acupressure are fine as far as they go, but how far can one go with needles and thumbs? Acutickling, uses the body's own vibrations, to reach the vary marrow of the body's bones! - That sounds like fun! - Not it doesn't. - Morning, Henry, you look peaked! - Yeah, I think it's the beginning of a splitting headache, you know? - oh? Now here, we'll fix that! - Hmm, eh... (chuckling) - Yeah, yeah it's better already, (mumbles)-- - You see, you see? - Yeah... - That looked like fun! - No it didn't. - Please wait in my office. (footsteps tapping) - I'm Mrs. Fritz L. Pitzle, I have an appointment? - Oh yes Mrs. Pitzle, if you'll just have a seat on the couch, Dr. Hinkle will be with you in a moment.. - Thank you. (footsteps tapping) - Good morning Dr. Heckyl. - Good morning Miss Finebum. Um, I don't suppose you've got any mail for me this morning have you please? - oh, I don't know about that. Here's your Clearasil bill, and this month's Magic Mirror. (chuckling) You really should get more rest, doctor. - Yes I should, a long one. (thumping) - Miss Finebum! Have I not asked you again and again not to wear those provocative skirts in the office? I mean do we really need a preview of the Straights of Gibraltar? - Are you making a subtle pass at me, doctor? - Looking down your decolletage, I can see all of your vital statistics! - I'll thank you to keep your eyes to yourself! (giggling) - when'd you get those, (spits) feet? Uh you can wait in my office, Mr. Cooger, I won't be a minute. - Aw, I sure thank you. - So what, Mrs. van Crystal, the pucker will pass and the pounds will peel off like a puff of smoke! Ah good morning Dr. Heckyl! Oh you look terrible. Oh wait 'til you hear the news! - Oh, I don't listen to the news. - Then if you insist I'll tell you! Come into my office. (chuckling) (laughing) - This is it already? - Are you kidding? Today is T-day. - T-day? - T-day, test day. Today is the day that I am finally at last testing, Dr. Vince Hinkle's (rubbery creaking) Instant Diet Paste. - You've tested it and it's, it's safe? - Are you kidding? One whole drop you could give a baby. Two whole drops unfortunately would kill a horse. - You tested it on a horse? - What do I need horses, I feel it in my bones! - You tested it on yourself? - Listen, echo, one tiny drop on the tongue, and 300 million wild proteins attach themselves to every cell, and immediately devour all offending particles, which means, fat. - But if you haven't tested it, how do you know it's safe? - Would I lie to myself? - Well I guess your patients are no concern of mine. Besides this is my last day on the planet. - Oh? You're going someplace else? - Vince, I've decided to kill myself. (baths bubbling) - Heckyl, suicide, don't waste your time. Death is a big nothing. All right now Mrs. Razorback it's your turn! (rubbery creaking) Uh-hmm. Now let's see... (cork popping) oh, ah! Ah! Hmm. - Dr. Hinckle. - Mrs. Pitzle. - I had an appointment. - I know. - I'm ready. - Right. Some day we'll be able to inject it, once we get the impurities out. (rubbery creaking) (mumbles), hmm? Now don't worry Mrs. Pitzle, the pucker will pass. Trust me, hmm? - Now then, did you take my advice? - Oh yes sir I did. All week long I walked in counter-clockwise semicircles instead of my usual clockwise semicircles, and by Thursday my tilt was totally corrected. - You are a, a very very good patient. These feet are looking a lot better now. - Well then, let me sign you up for our new Seville, with a $15,000 rebate on your signature! - Car? I haven't needed a car since I gave up drag racing! (chuckling) - Everybody needs a car. - What for, to pick up women? - Pickup women! (chuckling) - I pick up women, and they look at this face, huh? - Our insurance plan covers everything. - Yeah? Well I'm afraid the transplant will have to wait until we find a donor with two right feet. (footsteps thumping) (mumbling) Yes. - Huh? - Yes, it's wonderful! Congratulations, yes congratulations! - Thanks doc! - Uh, could I have the next patient, please? (pleasant music) - A miracle, it's a god damned miracle! Oh how can I ever thank you, doctor? - Uh, we'll think of something, but in the meantime pay to Miss Finebum the bill. - Who is this person? - Well, don't you recognize Mrs. Fritz L. Pitzle? - I had an appointment. - These are pretty flat feet, Mr. Tuck. - That's Druck, Lieutenant Mack Druck. - I see. (device beeping) Yes I think we can fix these. First of all I'm gonna give you a shot, of xylophome, it will help suppress the pain I'm gonna have to put you through. - I don't feel pain, I'm a cop. - Good, good. 'Cause right now I'm gonna rack your feet. Here's a bullet to bite. - To Il Topo this is a gum drop! (crunching) (gulping) (gun firing) (ricochet whistling) Told you I didn't feel pain, watch. (mechanism grinding) (clicking) (sizzling) (chuckling) - oh yes, (crackling) that's very interesting. - Look at this one. (chuckling) You know, you sure don't look like a doctor. You look more like a monster from outer space. - You know something Lieutenant? (moist cracking) I really am impressed with the depths of your insensitivity. - Thank you. It goes with the job. - To tell you the truth, you're not missing much. (crackling) If you're interested in the truth. - I'm only interested in guilt. (cracking) - oh excuse me I seem to have got carried away. (chattering) (spring reverberating) (tools thumping) will you excuse me please? - I don't feel a thing. (chattering) (mumbling) - Uh, that would be Dr. Heckyl, if you'll just have a seat, he'll be right with you. (eerie furtive music) (mumbling) - [Heckyl] God! - Now really, I want to... Ah, there you are, Mrs. Fran van Crisco, you look like you lost a whole person, heh, (chuckles)? (motor whirring) - Isn't it ugly? - [Heckyl] The other one, please. - I think all feet are ugly. I think feet are the ugliest form of human existence. You know I think feet are even uglier than warts. Don't you? (liquid gurgling) (lips smacking) - oh yes normally I would agree with you, but there are exceptions that make the whole thing, worthwhile. Now we'll just turn you around. (chair whirring) (screaming) (gasping) - I'm so sorry! - It's all right I'm used to it. - It's just I wasn't expecting you, you're, uh, I mean you remind me of someone I've seen somewhere. - I guess everybody's a type, huh? I don't see anything wrong with these feet. These feet are perfection. (pleasant music) - I think I'm getting a bunion. - Which one? Oh god at last a foot I could love. A foot I could eat... - Both. I know, you look just like that old, uh, I mean, you look like a man I see every morning at the bus stop. - Oh uh, shall we see if it's anything to worry about? Now then, this one's, not gonna hurt so, don't worry about anything just, relax, okay? (clicking) (motor buzzing) why does she come here to torment me? I just like to watch her get on the bus every morning. I didn't want to know her name, or her address, or anything. Did you give your address to Miss Finebum? Well, it's all over now, you can open up your eyes. (tender music) (chair whirring) oh gods... Those eyes. - [Patient] My mother always said, wash your feet twice a day, and see your podiatrist twice a year. - Your mother was a, a wonderful woman. Now, you take these feet home, these little tootsies, and you look after them, they deserve it, and then you ask Miss Finebum for an appointment with me tomorrow afternoon, all right? - So soon? - oh, you can never be, too soon. - Oh. I've decided to trust you. My feet are in your hands. - My heart is in your feet. - Are you the man at the bus stop? - Uh, the bus stop? (tense music) oh well um, you mean the buh, the bus stop outside here? Um, well yes I think I have seen you there sometimes when I'm, when I'm on my way to work. - So we're old friends. But, is this where you get on or where you get off? - Oh this is where I get off. (chair whirring) (footsteps tapping) (thumping) Miss Finebum? I don't want any more appointments this evening. (thumping) - No one is waiting Dr. Heckyl. (ominously pensive music) - Yeah well that figures. Oh and Miss Finebum? Don't bother locking up tonight, I shall be working late. - [Finebum] Goodnight Dr. Heckyl. - Goodnight Miss Finebum. (button thumping) Goodbye, Miss Finebum. (suspenseful music) (metallic clacking) Goodbye, oh ugly, piece of shit. (dramatic music) - Heckyl you wouldn't believe my diet paste is a big hit! What are you, cutting your throat? - I'm just shaving, c-congratulations. - Congratulations are nothing, this will be bigger than mahjong! Your shaving, with scissors? - I do keep them sharp. - Would you believe I gave Mrs. Fran van Crisco one drop of my paste and she shed 64 pounds in eight minutes? - Matter cannot be destroyed Mr. Hinkle, it's gonna go somewhere. - Well probably there was a little diarrhea. - Just, one drop you say? - Yes any more than that you would reduce yourself past the point of death. In fact, I believe that if you took enough, the vital proteins would eat up every cell and you would completely disappear, pft! - Without a trace? - well maybe a trace, maybe a kidney, who knows? As a matter of fact I'm, very much afraid that one of my ladies will go a little crazy, she'll break into my office, and, and help herself and... - would you like me to look after the paste, in case your ladies break in here and, and then, try and take it, would you? - That's what I wanted to ask you! I knew there was, oh, thank you Heckyl, thank you. Heckyl, this is my big break! - Goodbye Hinkle. - Uh, goodnight, Dr. Heckyl. (tense music) - what are you waiting for Heckyl? This is your big break, this is your chance to disappear. This is your chance to erase the ugliness, forever. (suspenseful music) Nothing to offend the undertaker. Except maybe a little diarrhea. (sighing) Go on Heckyl, why are you stalling? (suspenseful music) (gulping) (dramatic music) (rubbery creaking) (suspenseful dramatic music) (mumbles), disappear, disappear! I didn't disappear. I didn't die. My luck's still holding. I didn't die. My luck's still holding. (rubbery creaking) (bones cracking) (scrubbing) - The temperature in downtown San Texico is being withheld by order of the police. Otherwise it looks like a drizzle, clearing in time for the outbreak of (mumbles) breakfast, down at Francis X. President park. Turning to the lighter side of the news, here is (mumbles) Suicide Show! - [Host] Good evening all of you (mumbles) outsiders out there, we have oodles of news for you tonight! Among many mass suicides, eight ugly loners jumped from the Francis X. Patriot bridge today! Unfortunately, all survived! Better luck though than nine unattractive spinsters in Winston, Salem, who linked (mumbles) right elbows, and-- (crickets chirping) - Goodnight Wendy. Goodnight Abigail. Goodnight Rosemary. (chain rattling) (bird hooting) Goodnight Spot, my only friend. (snoring) (eerie music) (glass shattering) (snorting) (eerie dramatic music) (animalistic snorting) (panting) (grunting) (groaning) oh! (crickets chirping) (loon hooting) (mysterious music) My god, I'm beautiful! (clicking) (chair creaking) (laughing) (loon hooting) (telephone clattering) (telephone ringing) - [Hinkle] who the hell is this at four o'clock in the morning? (telephone clunking) - No I'll surprise him! I, I haven't got a... I have got a new, voice. (mumbling) (shouting in foreign language) (thumping) (tense music) (thumping) (suspenseful music) (glass shattering) (crickets chirping) (shouting in foreign language) - [Man] Hey shut up, it's three o'clock in the morning! - I., la la, oh la, la la, la la, la la, ooh... (dog barking) (hinges creaking) - Shh! (tense music) (suspenseful music) (gasping) - I'm sorry about that Mrs. Quivel, I was just getting rid of some useless shoes. - Who are you? - oh I forgot, we haven't been introduced, have we? I'm Dr. Heckyl's young cousin from merry old England. - Cousin? - Yes, we don't look very alike, do we? (chuckles) Some people say we haven't got the same relatives. - Would you like for me to, fill a cup of coffee, Mr... Uh... - Are you sure it's just a cup of coffee you want to fix me Mrs. Quivel? (scuffling) (grunting) (beads rattling) oh sex baby! - (gasps) oh! (clattering) (grunting) oh wow! (mumbling) oh, my! - [Henkyl] (mumbles), oh are you... - oh (mumbles)! (lips smacking) oh help me (mumbles) evil! - (mumbles) so long! - Help! - I would have picked a more - oh! - Attractive younger woman, - oh, oh! - but I can't wait any longer, now is the time baby! - Oh no, oh mamma this had better be a dream, or (mumbling)! What did you say? - oh don't worry about what I said! (mumbles) baby, concentrate on love! - Love is a word, love is a wild dove! - (grunts) well then tell me you love me, just tell me you love me! - Love me! - oh I love you! - Love me! - Tell me you love me! - I love you! - Mmmm... (panting) (crickets chirping) That's better. For a moment I thought you were going to go on pretending that you, you didn't love me. - Speaking of love, my husband gets home around five a.m.. - Your husband... who but old Bull? (chuckling) when he sees my beautiful face, he's going to drop dead with envy. - When he sees that face of yours he's gonna step on it like an itty bitty frog. Squish! (ominous music) - A frog? Are you equating my face to a frog, Mrs. Quivel? - No. - Frogs are ugly, Mrs. Quivel. Are you suggesting that I am ugly? - No... - with a nose only good enough, to rub in the corns and bunions of my tormentors? (clattering) - No, (mumbles)... Let go of my foot! - Are you suggesting, that my face, is less handsome, than your foot, Mrs. Quivel? Because if you are, you might just as well go up in smoke, dear lady! (electricity zapping) (screaming) (dramatic music) She's dead. And I'm still a virgin (sniffs)! (furtive music) (crickets chirping) (loons hooting) (hinges creaking) Farewell Mrs. Quival, you silly old tramp. Your fatal misfortune was missing my love. (debris scuffling) (patting) (crickets chirping) (whistling) (snoring) - [Man] You ought to take a look in here, see what I can find today. I found a vacuum cleaner. That vacuum cleaner never worked! Well, maybe we ought to get it (mumbles), (mumbles) get it fixed, yeah, why not maybe we'll find some money in there? I love garbage, look at that garbage, smell that garbage! Garbage is my life. You know how they empty garbage in Japan? (metallic clattering) No how do they empty garbage in Japan? (metallic thudding) I asked 'ya 'cause I thought you knew. Don't keep asking me (mumbles)! Ah! (grunting) (metallic thudding) Hats always fit. (eerie music) Good morning! (tense music) - Yes it is! Indeed. (pleasant music) (footsteps tapping) (doorbell jingling) (door thudding) (feet scuffling) (water splashing) - oh! - Ha ha ha! (bus rumbling) (brakes hissing) (door thudding) (footsteps tapping) (chattering) (motor revving) - oh, ooh! Oh sir (mumbles)! You! - You want to sit here! (bus rumbling) (passengers chattering) (lips smacking) (patting) (brakes hissing) (engine revving) (footsteps tapping) (bus rumbling) (tense music) (brakes hissing) (engine revving) - [Announcer] Hi there America, I'm Jake Rabbit, inviting you to hop into Bunny Burrito for a delicious Bunny Burger, Bunny Melt, Bunny Thermidor, Cocoa Bunny, and this week's special, old fashioned, scrumptious, Hare pie! Hi there America, I'm Jake Rabbit, inviting you to hop into Bunny Burrito for a delicious... (birds chirping) - Can I get you another one? It'd help you forget her. - Maybe she's worth remembering. - The trouble with memories is you can't touch 'em. - Hi there America, - That's right. - I'm Jake Rabbit... - Since you're not a memory does that mean that I can touch you? - That depends on my mood. - Why don't you test your mood on me tonight? - Oh my I don't even know your name! - What's in a name? All names are hype. - Is your name Hype? - [Announcer] Hi there America, I'm Jake Rabbit... - Sure. - My name's Debra Kate, pleased to meet you. (twanging) - 6:30. - All right. - The corner of Sixth and Main. - See you then Mr. Hype. - I'll see you cold and (mumbles), cheeky bitch. (footsteps tapping) Good morning Mrs. (mumbles). Oh, good morning Talltale! (smacking) - oh! (chattering) (telephone ringing) - No I'm sorry, doctor's not due in yet. Okay. - Miss Finebum, did you send out my statements? Miss Dimcrinze swears that she hasn't had one in two months! - Mm, we've turned her over for collection. - How's the mail this morning, Finebum? - [Hoo] what in god's name is that? - The mail? What office were you looking for? Dr. Hoo! - You smell like, potting chem. - This office. - [Acutickler] That perfume must have been a terrific bargain. What is it, war surplus? - Did you have an appointment? - [Hinkle] Hoo, I want you should see something! - Do I need an appointment? - Did you get a whiff of Miss Finebum this morning? - Well, (chuckles), exceptions have been made. - Tell me do you think I'm, an exceptionally good looking fellow? - (sighs) what? (chuckling) - (sighs) I won't tease you anymore, Finebum. I'm Dr. Heckyl's cousin, I'm taking over his practice, he's been taken suddenly ill. In fact you could say the old frog is crouching at the threshold of Death's back door. (foreboding music) - [Hinkle] Look on these ladies Hoo, what do you see that they have in common? - They're all, underweight, and need a good tickle! (giggling) (smacking) - I want to introduce, y-y-you to them! This is Mrs. Fritz L. Pitzle, formerly 296 pounds! And this is Mrs. Fran van Crisco, 268 pounds only yesterday! And Mrs. Vilmarble, 301, and Mrs. Whitespry, 294, (giggling) and of course Mrs. Murphy, 302. (laughing) Eh, eh, eh... - I'll see my first patient. (tense music) - who in the hell is that person? - Who is that guy? - Dr. Heckyl's cousin, he's taking over the practice. He says-- - Cousin? - Taking over the practice? - Cousin? - Is he a doctor? - Don't know, he says that Dr. Heckyl is-- - what is his name, this cousin? - But did he say he's a doctor? - He didn't say. He didn't say, but he said... (tense music) He said Dr. Heckyl is dying. - Playing cops and robbers again, Lieutenant? (whirring) (gun clicking) - who are you? - I'm Hype, Mr. Hype, I'm Heckyl's cousin. I'm standing in for him while he's sick. Oh I see you have a, an in-growing nail. - Are you a podiatrist? (creaking) (spring reverberating) - No, I'm just an enthusiastic amateur. Do you know I must tell you Druck these are the ugliest feet I've ever seen in my life. - How'd you know my name? - I saw your picture on a dart board. (motor whirring) - what's the matter with Heckyl? - Who cares? (grinding) well, these feet are gonna have to come off. - Go ahead. Just where did you study medicine, Dr. Hype? - That's Mr. Hype. I didn't, I just picked it up. - I know what you mean, them schools are full of shit. - Right, anything that's important that I should know, will come from in here. (patting) - Right, right. (chuckling) Are you really serious about cutting off my feet Hype? - Sure, why not? - Don't try to snow me Hype. This is no casual amputation! You want to cut off my feet so I can't follow 'ya! - Why should I worry about you following me, hmm? (smacking) (spring reverberating) with feet like that, and you couldn't follow me out of bed! - You making a perverted proposal to me mister? - Me? Me make a pass at a cop? Me make a pass at a god damn ugly fat little cop? A god damned ugly, fat sot, male cop? Jesus Christ, that is it! I have had it! (clattering) (thumping) (spring reverberating) I've been stinking, filthy, fuck off for 30 bloody years! I think I've paid my bloody dues! (cart clattering) - Crazy son of a bitch. (tense music) (slamming) (chattering) - Miss Finebum! Cancel my appointments for the rest of the day, will you? (door slamming) (suspenseful music) - who is that man? - You don't know? - No! - Well I guess I'd better find out. - What time is Coral Coreen's appointment with me? - [Finebum] 3:30. - Well don't cancel that one, will you? Huh? (sighing) (chuckling) (Hype laughing) And good morning to you, Lushtush! (slapping) - ooh! (clattering) (glass breaking) - [Man] How you like this one baby? - How come we always have to get the same kind of car? - Well I need it (door thumping) for my work. - I hate it! - Hey bimbo, this thing is a rip-off! - I can only give you $50 off! - I still hate it! (tires screeching) (crashing) - Now this, is a car! - Why should I believe you? - Ah, good question sir, you shouldn't believe me, you should believe instead the name and tradition of this great mark! That belief's what faith's all about! - You are a horrid, plastic person. How much do you want for this pile of metallic (mumbles)? - It's marked down, $29,999.99, but uh... - I knew it would be cheap. I'd like to take it for a spin. - Why certainly sir, I'd be delighted to take you any place you'd care to go! - Not with you dimwit, I've got to be alone with this car, as with a woman, to get the feel of it! - Alone? - Look, you were recommended to me by your podiatrist, and my cousin Dr. Henry Heckyl. He's as honest as he is ugly. - Oh, cousin, well sure. - Actually I'm only a figment of Heckyl's imagination. - Well any cousin of Dr. Heckyl's is a cousin of mine. - He's a horny toad, all he does is think about (engine revving) picking up women. (gears rattling) So long sucker. (engine revving) (energetic rock music) (engine revving) All right, all right, all right, this is life (chuckles)! This is where it all (mumbles)! Doctor doctor, (mumbles)! Oh yes (chuckling)! Well my name's, Hype! (engine revving) (tires screeching) (laughing) (tires screeching) (laughing) (engine revving) ooh fuck! (birds chirping) (car rumbling) (engine revving) (horn honking) (footsteps tapping) Hi there Miss Coreen. Or should I call you Coral? - Who are you? - You wouldn't by any chance be on your way to your appointment with your podiatrist, would you? If so I shall be pleased to give you a lift! - How would you know that? - Don't you remember me? I followed you to work today. (tense music) on the bus. You managed to give me the slip before I could catch you, but you won't get away this time, will you? (scuffling) (gasping) (laughing) - Miss uh... - oh Mr. Flynn! - Ah... - I'm sorry! - Are you all right? You seem frightened. - No, I'm all right. It's nothing. - Who is that man? - I think he's Death. - Death? (metallic clicking) He's getting out. I think you'd better come with me. (tense music) (police radio chattering) In fact I think you could do a bit more. (door thudding) - You shouldn't go to all this trouble. - oh it's no trouble at all. Matter of fact... - Can it be that he is handsomer than me? (grunting) (tires screeching) (motor rattling) This can't have happened to me! I'll kill her! (tires screeching) She's my dream of love! I'll kill him! (tires screeching) I'm a dreamer myself! I'll kill them together! (motor rattling) (tires screeching) we were (mumbles) for each other! Eh, well then I'll kill myself. (eerie unsteady music) (tires screeching) (suspenseful music) (dramatic music) - I dropped my bag! (motor revving) (pleasant music) - [Hype] She smiled at me. She wants to be, with me, to touch me, and to love me, but I won't let her love me, because only Coral's good enough to love me. Good enough to be loved, by me. Oh, but in the meantime I guess I could be a good sport and let this lady have me. (furtive music) (footsteps tapping) Hello there. - This your car? - Yes, it's one of them. - I nearly dented your grill with my buttocks, didn't I? It's lovely, isn't it, nearly as good looking as its driver. - Well that's like comparing emeralds and rubies, isn't it? - I like both kinds. - Would you care for a lift? - My car or yours? (door clattering) what a quaint place. A bit too obvious for my taste. - Yes it is, a little bit obvious, isn't it? But on the other hand you see it's always lacked a certain, woman's touch. - I see you're (mumbles) classics. (mumbles) isn't it? - Long may it ripple. - Oh, is this it? - Yes this is it. (comical furtive music) (squishing) - will there be anything special? - (sighs) I want you to remember that you're not working now. You're falling in love, all right? - Gotcha, I only ask 'cause I feel very giving. - I am very touched. Well perhaps there is something a little special. - Go on, I'm (mumbles), (chuckles). - I want you to be, absolutely honest. - I don't think I've ever tried that. - You can do absolutely anything you want to if you put your mind to it. - It's not your mind that does the love you know, is it? - Well perhaps you're shy? - Yeah, with somebody watching. - Who? Oh well (chuckles)! (thumping) old spot. This is Spot, say hello, Spot. Say hello. Uh, I'm so sorry, I didn't quite catch your name. (giggling) - My name's Liza Rowne, what's yours? Oh it's Spot, isn't it (giggles)? - [Hype] Tell me, who is the most beautiful person in this room, Liza? - Well it's (mumbles) Spot! (lips smacking) - oh, not you stupid, had it been you I wouldn't have asked you, would I, hmm? - Oh, I see. Well let me think. Oh I know, the most beautiful person in this room, is Spot! - No! I'm just a rug to be walked on, Mr. Hyde wants you to tell the truth! He wants you to tell him that he's the most beautiful person in the room, if that's the truth, and if it's not the truth, then I'm just a, a greasy frog, a slimy greasy frog with one red eye, and one green eye! And ears like knuckles, and a nose like an over-ripe, half-eaten dirty carrot, go on tell me that! - Huh? - What are you thinking? - You're the John, what do you want me to think? - I want you to think what you, really think. You do think don't you? Look into these eyes. My eyes, (mumbles)... - Right. - Are they both, blue, both of them? Both, beautifully blue, sharp, clear? Aquamarine, beautiful blue? (eerie tense music) - oh they are blue and beautiful for a fact. But it's no good looking too deep, is it? - What do you see? I said what do you see? What do you see, in my eyes... - Can't quite make it out, it's something... Something tacky. (dramatic music) (eerie growling) (screaming) (birds chirping) - what happened? Oh Hype, don't give a sack of shit. - Hey look at this, what do ya got? I found 30 cents, we split it! Of course we split it, we split everything, don't we? 15 for you and 15 for me. Yeah we split everything but the cigars. It's 'cause I don't smoke! Smoke if you like the taste of orange peels, they're not bad. (rustling) (mumbling) - Hello Druck, (mumbling) looking for something? (metal squeaking) - I don't know. (comically pensive music) Am I? - [Hype] No you're not. - [Mack] why don't I just puree your thoughts? (laughing) - In all sincerity, the customer drove out of here in a near new, two-user, (mumbles) convertible and has not, I repeat not come back! - Gee we're just real sorry about that sir, but, testimony of a used car dealer is inadmissible. (engine revving) Ain't that right Dummy? - Yeah! (car rumbling) - officer. This man obviously can't walk a straight line, will you arrest him please? (patting) - oh, not again! (thudding) - No more sup-hose! - Mr. Hype's office? - No more Maalox. (sighing) - And no more (mumbles). - Good morning to you, Miss Biggybottom! Oh so elegant! So slim, so, so delicious. (tense music) - He knows Beebeebuns. - He knows everyone. - And nobody seems to know him. - Okay, okay, uh, no, put, put the tray on the top of the trolley, there, and uh, the orchids, dump those on the top of that speaker over there. And uh... - Listen, friend, I am, uh, uh d-doctor - Hinkle (laughs)! - too... - Come in I've got some news for you! Okay, come on flunkies, you can leave it here I'll arrange it all myself. - You got news for me... - Come on come on come on! - Is it about Heckyl? - oh forget Heckyl! Now, you remember that blonde you used to talk to me about? - Eh the blonde, the girl from Heckyl's dreams? - Right right right! Now, she is coming here, this afternoon for an appointment. - Dr. Heckyl's dream girl is coming here and you're excited? - Yes of course I'm excited after 13 years, who wouldn't be? Look, I got, I've got champagne, I've got chocolates, I've got caviar, I've got balloons, I've got music, I've got flowers! The only thing I haven't got is experience. Tell me Hinkle, you a fairly good looking fellow, what is a sure fired way of getting into a girl's pants? - Become a presser (chuckles). (chuckling) - Always the same old Hinkle, eh... - Look, (stammers) who are you? - Still don't know? - All I know is that you're planning to seduce Dr. Heckyl's dream girl, and you don't even tell me how he is sick. I went to his house today over lunch, and I found bupkis! - Keep away from that house. (tense music) - what have you done, to me friend Heckyl? - I ate him. (tense music) (screaming) (mysterious unsteady music) (squishing) (crackling) (screaming) (wooden crackling) (crashing) (screaming) - I'm fat! I'm fat! I'm fat (sobs)! (sobbing) - oh Henry! (crying) (women whimpering) - (sighs) oh well, what the hell. (thumping) (tense music) (porcelain shattering) - oh god! (mumbles) fat, relapse? Next it will be me! Oh god I'm not coming back! No! No I won't go! (soft clattering) (snoring) (unsteady eerie music) (growling) (snarling) (knocking) - Mr. Hype? (ripping) (knocking) (door clattering) (dramatic music) Mr. Hype? Dr. Heckyl! - Heckyl! - Heykyl! - Uh, hi ya fellas. (grunting) - oh, Miss Coreen's outside! - Where'd you come from? - Oh uh, a vulture brought me. I was in the bathroom. - Uh eh eh where is Mr. Hype? - He's left. - Well he didn't get past me! - Everything gets past you Finebum! - Oh shut up Hoo! - He left from the bathroom. - That's impossible, Heckyl! - The only way out through the bathroom is through the toilet! - And he said you were deathly ill! - Who? - Your cousin! - Oh he was no cousin of mine. - No cousin? Were you sick? - Oh Hinkle, was I sick. - Well then, we'd better let you see your first patient now, but we'll talk on this later! Right Hoo? - I really, can't get that involved! Finebum, send in my next victim! (mumbling) (tender music) (mumbling) - Hello Dr. Heckyl! Lots of excitement around here to-- oh, what have you done to your office? Hmm? - Do you like it? - It's beautiful. - Yes I thought it would uh, make my patients feel a little more comfortable. - Aw, I feel very comfortable with you. Now that the ice so to speak is broken. - Oh. Would you uh, uh, would oh would you uh-um, (thumping) would you like some caviar? Would you care for a bonbon? - I was almost assaulted today. A real creep, I mean a weirdo! - Yeah well I guess it takes all kinds, yes? - Not this kind. He followed me on the bus, and he leered. He grabbed an old lady's seat, and he even tried to pick me up! He knew all about me. I think he was Death, or somebody. He had these terrible eyes. You know I think he really wanted to kill me! - Oh! Oh would you, would you like a, a glass of... (glass ringing) (glass shattering) - Can I tell you something doc? You're terrific. - Uh was he uh, a really good looking guy? - Who? - The one with the (tender music) frightening eyes? - Oh him, who cares? - Oh, but would you like, a chocolate covered cherry? - Oh thanks. He was physically attractive as far as that goes. But he acts as if he owned the world. - Beautiful people are always forgiven, always given everything. You're a beautiful person, you should know that. - Can I tell you a secret doc? Beauty's boring. I mean I'm only skin deep. You're beautiful inside. - Yeah but for my kind of beauty there's no cure. Shall I tell you how I got like this? I'll tell you anyway. Nobody really knows, all they know is that, when my mother was carrying me she was sniffing glue. When she was nursing me she was sniffing glue. The day I was born she was sniffing glue. So now every time I have a glass of milk, I taste glue. Every time I lick a stamp or an envelope, I'm suddenly back at my mother's bosom. But who would nurse me now? - I would, if I was a nurse. (eerie suspenseful music) (crickets chirping) (door clattering) (hinges creaking) - Heckyl, you're a sanctimonious schmuck. (fog horn blowing) (dog howling) (suspenseful music) (cash register ringing) (plodding music) (paper rustling) (fog horn blowing) You know what you've got to do. Drop dead. Now turn around, and go back to Hinkle's office, and get the paste bottle out of the waste basket. (tense music) Not for a million. (fog horn blowing) (dog howling) (crickets chirping) (fog horn blowing) (suspenseful music) Excuse me miss. Um, but Mr. Hype has asked me to tell you that while you were expecting him for, our little meeting now, he's not going to be able to make it. Uh, ooh which is probably just as well for you because otherwise he probably could have murdered you! He could have murdered you! (fog horn blowing) I could have taken her to a movie, to a Chinese restaurant, to a waterbed motel. (dog howling) (tense music) The one thing that can get me there, is in Hinkle's waste basket. Get it now, now! (tense music) (panting) where's the paste? Oh... No paste here. Oh oh, oh... oh, oh... Don't be a fool! Where's the paste? (crickets chirping) (mysterious music) (tense music) (garbage rustling) (loon hooting) (dog howling) I'll never find it. Dig deeper, creep! I can't find it! Into the bin, goblin, find that paste or I'll twist your precious (mumbles) little neck till the skull pops out of the skin! (hinges creaking) (metallic clattering) (hinges creaking) (metallic clattering) - I'll bet I find a really good hat this time! Oh jeez some people got no respect for garbage! And the boss don't want no more bodies out at the dump! Why should he care, it's all garbage, ain't it? (chuckling) That just shows you don't know shit from garbage. Garbage stinks, feet stink. (metallic clattering) (loon hooting) - I found it! (hinges creaking) (metallic thudding) - what'd you see? You wouldn't believe me if I told you. Try me, like hell I will. Sergeant Fleacollar? - Hello! - I want to report a monster in my garbage! How soon can you get here? - Right away! - Good! (siren howling) A monster? You saw the monster? (tires screeching) I said you wouldn't believe me, and you're right I don't, it's crazy! Hi guys, what took you so long? (police radio chattering) (doors thudding) - what's this about a monster? - As monster's go, this one is a particularly unappealing, bile-green. When I spotted him, he was ingesting a half-eaten carrot. My carrot I might add! If you move sharp you can still catch him, right here! In the garbage! - In the garbage! (crickets chirping) (police radio chattering) - [Both] No monster! - No monster. - There he is! (unsteady dramatic music) And he's stealing my garbage! - Get the monster! This is officer Gurnisht Hilfn, there's a, bile-green garbage eating monster on the loose. Repeat, monster on the loose! (crickets chirping) (eerie suspenseful music) (thumping) (hinges creaking) (clattering) (glass shattering) (window clacking) (glass crunching) (metallic clattering) (clothes rustling) (grunting) - oh, aw, (mumbles), mmm... Uh, uh, uh... (nervous giggling) Better, stay there, stay there, don't move! Stay right there! (gasping) (door thudding) - Don't worry, I wouldn't hurt a fly! Uh don't uh call uh, uh, uh, the police! (footsteps scuffling) - Ah, oh, oh... (telephone ringing) Ah, oh, (grunting)... - what the hell do you think you're doing with that man? Why that's inhuman! - Eh, (coughs), (inmate screaming) may I ask you just one question? - Yes my poor mistreated man, go ahead and ask me your question. - What kind of car are you now driving? - My mistake. - I'm with you! - Whack him! (bell ringing) - ow! (scuffling) (clacking) - Ah! Hello? (inmates screaming) Hello? Eh this, San Texaco Police, this is Sergeant Fleacollar speaking. - Allo, this is Pizelle Puree, do you remember me? - You don't think that I remember every broad that I-- - Forget the cracks eh? I want to report a monster from out of in space. - A monster (chuckles)? Are you uh, bragging or complaining? - Don't laugh at me copper, it just came out of my closet. - I'll take it. - Huh? - This is Lieutenant Druck. - He came down on top of my bed next to my body, can you imagine? (grunting) - Did he have one red eye, one green eye, hair like it was taken off of a Halloween mask and a nose like a half-eaten carrot? - Yes, he is now under my bed, (eerie gurgling) making disgusting noises. - That's no monster, that's my podiatrist. - Don't let me in into your habit mister, I am trapped in my water closet. - Just hang loose lady, huh? He wouldn't hurt a fly, we'll be there in a couple of hours. (telephone clattering) - Silly bastard. He didn't even get my address. (lid clattering) (peppy music) - It's all right madam, I'm beautiful again. - Who are you? How did you get in? And where is the monster? - How many questions am I supposed to answer, hmm? The last time I saw the monster, he was flying across the moon. Why don't we talk about ourselves? - Us? You mean, this nightmare might become a romance? Are you trying to make me crazy in my head? - You, are beautiful. - I'm at home, in my bedroom, you are a total stranger, and the police is on its way. - That will take three hours. You are gorgeous. - Uh, but I don't know you. Where do you come from? - Oh, I madam, am a doctor. Dr. Heckyl. People like me, I can't tell why because I'm as ugly, as a blind horse. - Hmm, you may be dangerous, but you're not so ugly honey! (lips smacking) (sighing) - That's the first time I've ever kissed a girl. - I bet you say that to all the girls. - No, girls are frightened of me. They run away from me. - Well, I'm not running. - No. But you trod on my new foot, and you know, as for all those other girls, they, they see something tacky in my eyes. - Let me see! What, kind of a thing are you? - Thing? Thing? What kind of a thing am I? (mumbling) Now look at this nose, look at these dimples! - But I (mumbles)! - How can you say that? Let me show you my (threads popping) (mumbles) body! - No! No, oh, no! (gasping) Let me go (gasps)! - You ask the mirror on the wall, who is the grooviest of them all? - Please let me go! - You come to bed with me, and you show me what I have been missing in bed for the last years! (gasping) - oh, all right, okay! (suspenseful music) (sighing) (gasping) - Liar! (thudding) (squeaking) (peppy music) Any woman who really appreciates my attractiveness, that woman will live. (crickets chirping) (footsteps tapping) (metallic clattering) (tense music) For god's sake Hype, (ominous music) stay away from Coral! (clacking) (feverish music) (crickets chirping) (footsteps tapping) (mumbling) (clattering) (grunting) (mumbling) - [Man] You may call me Harry. If I may call you Coral. - [Coral] You can call me anytime you want. - [Man] Gabreel's file, my dear. Proceed. - [Coral] (mumbles) so dry. - [Man] I'll fetch a fresh champagne. - [Coral] oh don't turn on the lights! (man singing) (bottles clinking) ♪ If I could be, whatever I wanted to be ♪ ♪ I think I'd like to be (mumbles) a tree ♪ ♪ If I could be, whatever I wanted to be ♪ ♪ I think I ♪ (pottery breaking) (shards clattering) - ooh uh! (mysterious music) Hmm. (Hype singing) (door clattering) (hinges creaking) (mysterious music) (coat rustling) (cork popping) You, and the night, and champagne. (thumping) To hell with the champagne, I'll take you. (bed creaking) - oh, Herringbone! (giggling) (gasping) oh you mad (mumbles)... - [Hype] Herringbone? Herringbone? Herringbone Flynn, I'm sick of Herringbone Flynn! Herringbone Flynn isn't in! - Who is it? - who is this? Who am I? I'm Mr. Hype, your doctor and friend and now, your lover! - Hmm... No! No, oh! (screaming) (switch clicking) Dr. Heckyl! (tense music) - Miss Coreen! - Oh I can explain everything! - Well explain it to the police. They'll be here any minute. - Dr. Heckyl, what are you doing in my arms? You're supposed to be looking after my feet. - Might as well get another bottle of champagne! (tender music) - Aren't you afraid of me? - Why, do you want me to be afraid of you? - Oh no no no no (chuckles)! - Well doc, we're gonna have to start calling you Speedy Gonzales! - Speedy Gonzales! - There is a simple explanation! - Simple? - Oh it was simple, he hit me over the head with a flower pot and then, made love to my, faithful employee. - Book him for insinuation of affection, assault with a flower pot, and murder. - Murder? - Murder! - (gasps) You may look like a monster Henry, but you make love like a man. - Oh gee thanks. - Take him, take him away! - Oh, (mumbles), oh, shit! You got the wrong guy, it's a, it's a, it's a bum rap! - [Coral] oh! - [Fleacollar] You did say first degree? - [Gurnisht] we got him cold, the evidence and the witnesses are right over there! (distant shouting) - [Heckyl] But can I make a phone call please? (telephone ringing) (grunting) - Thanks. Uh, hello? Uh, what do you mean it's a long story? - I've only got one dime. Would you come and bail me out of here? - I haven't got any money. - Get the money from Hoo, Hoo's got money. Uh and then, and then come and get me out of here would you? - Look, boychick, I haven't got a car. And even if I did have a car I couldn't drive it because I can't drive! Besides, all my patients are going fat and skinny and skinny and fat, then fat and skinny, I'm surrounded by embarrassments. - You get the car from Hoo, Hoo's got a car and, make him drive you down here. Uh and please come and, come and bail me out of here! - I'll think about it. Goodbye. - Who is that? - What do you care? (telephone clattering) (eerie tense music) (crackling) (animalistic whining) (metallic clanking) (metallic clanking) (whip snapping) (groaning) (footsteps tapping) (eerie pleasant music) - Hiya! (weapons whooshing) (grunting) I'm Bad William! You free to stay, as long as you don't step on my shadow, which is bigger, than you! (distant screaming) You sure is one ugly little mother, isn't you? If you's a bug I'd step on you, but I'd be afraid what might come out, (chuckling)! (sniffing) - All right, I have some money, this is my mad money. This certainly is mad! - All right kids, there'll be no more volunteer inmates! - Hey excuse me Commandant, we are here to bail out a particular Dr. Heckyl, our partner. - You couldn't bail him out with a stomach pump! - You don't just bail somebody out for murder! - He didn't say anything about murder. (chuckling) (distant screaming) - Anybody step or fall on my shadow is a dead mother, that's for sure! (Heckyl snarling) (eerie music) (grunting) Hey bro, can you teach me how to do that? - My pleasure. (cork popping) (inmate howling) (rubbery creaking) (grunting) (chuckling) - Listen Lieutenant we all know that Heckyl couldn't even murder his own worst enemy! - Gimme his name and address. - Who, Heckyl's? - His worst enemy. - This is ridiculous, let's just talk to him and get to the bottom of all this fiddle-faddle. - why not? - Maybe you're right I'll go get him. But he's not going anywhere! (elastic twanging) (cartoonish thumping) (crunching) - Ah! (spring reverberating) (rubbery thumping) Iranian asshole! (inmates shouting) - Hype, where's Dr. Heckyl? - He hit me on the head and took my place. - What were you doing in there? - I was minding my own business. - Just what is your business, mister? - I dabble in podiatry. - I would be a bit surprised. - Look Lieutenant are you charging me with anything? - No you sneaky bastard. Get him out of here! - If you insist! (keys clattering) - Ready, aim, fire! (machine gun firing) (groaning) (metallic slamming) (eerie music) (eerie gibbering) (pleasant music) - Hot, damn! It's me! (crickets chirping) (traffic rumbling) (hinges creaking) (footsteps tapping) (sniffing) - My dear Hinkle, since you came here to pick up Heckyl and you found Hype, does that lead you to any deep, significant conclusions? - [Hinkle] You would like, maybe a lift sir? - Yeah, providing you can drop me at Coral's, certainly. (engine revving) (van rumbling) (clacking) (metallic sliding) (metallic sliding) (thudding) (engine revving) (tires screeching) (door thumping) (crickets chirping) (motor humming) - Now listen Hype, I know you were Dr. Heckyl once, and for all I know you might be Dr. Heckyl again, but what I want to know is how did you do it? - Why don't you shut up Hinkle, you fat old fool? I don't think you know what you've discovered but you could be the greatest doctor of all time. - Well I uh... what? - You know that wild protein of yours? - Yeah. - When it attaches itself to everybodys' cell, it removes all offending attributes. - Meaning, fat. - Meaning, whatever your subconscious wants to tell you it means. It leaves only what the patient sees as perfection, his own perfection. - Ah, then you are Dr. Heckyl's idea of himself as a good looking fellow. - Exactly. (tires screeching) (eerie music) No... (grunting) (moist crackling) (grunting) (crickets chirping) (tense music) (tiger growling) (exotic birds singing) (engine rattling) - [Mack] Surround the van and move in when I give the word. - Everything (mumbles). (tiger snarling) (crickets chirping) (comically amusing music) - Now I've seen everything. - You mean this stuff? Turns you into that nice looking chap? (cork popping) - No no no, no no no! - No don't do it, don't do (rubbery creaking) it, you mustn't do that! (crickets chirping) (exotic birds singing) oh it's too late. - (sighs) Is is, too late... - Too late for what? - I can't stay and see this happen to you. - Hmm? - Me too. (doors clattering) (curiously tense music) (tiger growling) (exotic birds singing) - what's the matter? - Hoo, you are too impulsive! That's what's the matter. - When that diet paste changes you into your favorite image, it rules that image, with your subconscious, rebellious, infantile, mirror mentality. Alter ego. - Well it turns your head inside out. - It fulfills all your dreams and turns you into the kind of person, you've always hated most of all, whose powers you've, secretly coveted. The monster I became has, has no compassion. - Take him. - Take him. - He will kill, anybody who doesn't fall in love with him. - Well, eventually we could fix that, uh, but now eh... - what the-- (scuffling) - Rar! (dramatic music) (Hoo laughing) (groaning) (laughing) (grunting) (gibbering) (suspenseful music) (eerie music) (whimpering) (panting) (animal growling) (exotic birds singing) (mysterious music) (snarling) - [All] Miss Finebum! - Miss Finebum! - It is Miss Finebum. (tense music) - (sighs) well, not exactly. But who are we to split hairs (chuckles)? Oh (sighs)! Oh (laughs)! Love it, love (mumbles)! (tense music) How did you know? When I didn't? Oh... (exotic birds singing) (mysterious music) - oh, oh no, - Give me the paste! - oh, oh no, it's mine! - Give it to me! - I created it! No, no, not, not, not for a million! - That's evidence, arrest - No! - That man! - No! Let go of my arm, Druck, he stole the paste already! Heckyl, quit! - It's gotta be, destroyed! (dramatic music) (slide whistle descending) (spring reverberating) (rattling) - Uh, my paste! I've got to get my paste, he threw it in that big bird cage! (crickets chirping) (exotic birds singing) - well go get him! (comical clanking) - well go get him! (tiger snarling) - (pants) oh my, my future my, my fortune! My life! - Aha! Breaking in are we? - oh no don't shoot Captain, I was just trying to go inside to recover the evidence. (grunting) (gun firing) - Got get 'em, tiger! - oh, thanks. (chuckling) (metallic clattering) - Uh-ah... - No! (tiger growling) Be a nice pussy cat! Ah, (whimpering), oh wait a minute! No, please, (mumbles), please, oh, dear, ah! No, (grunts)... (growling) - He got away! - what? - He got away! - who? - Shut up! (crickets chirping) what? (metallic clanking) (Hinkle panting) - I found it! I, I fff, I found it, found it! - Yeah it's gone. - Ah, ah! (tiger growling) (tiger snarling) (tense music) - I'll take that. That. Finebum! - Right here Mr. Hype! - Get the guns! (suspenseful music) Chain them up! (clanking) - I'm with you! - I know, and I'm with you. - Because I'm perfect? The ultimate seductress? - Because we are as one, invincible! (mumbling) Invincible! - Let's face it, we're probably immortal! - Why don't you shoot each other and find out? (mumbling) - You get in my way again, smoothbrain, and you'll wish your mother had strangled you at birth! - She tried! (air hissing) - You are brilliant! Let's take a police car! - Oh! (lips smacking) I want to drive! (door clattering) (gasping) (door thudding) Try one on for size! - Hats always fit, my dear! (giggling) (spitting) (engine revving) - I'll terminate that bastard! (crunching) Tonight! (crunching) (exotic birds singing) Follow me. - [Gurnisht] Follow me! (handcuffs clacking) (tiger growling) (exotic birds singing) (crickets chirping) - what do you think? - I think you're a good looking hunk of man. - And I think you're a delicious tomato. - You're fantastically handsome! - Hmm... You are the most beautiful woman in the world. - You, are a Greek, god! - You're Helen of Troy! (sighing) Park here! (sighing) (switch clicking) - That was the first time for me. - I think that was the first time for anyone. Do you want to go again? - Do you think you can? - Oh you are cute. (sighing) - oh, you are, nice... - You are adorable... (sighing) - You are, (sighs), irresistible! (sighing) (gasping) (moaning) (applauding) (eerie music) (door thudding) - All right, move it! - Yeah, yeah. - Surround Unit one! - okay! Move it! Surround Unit one! (panting) (mumbling) (sighing) (mumbling) - Go on, you big stiff! (moaning) (eerie music) (crowd chattering) wha, ah (gasps)! (screaming) Heckyl, you! Ach (groans)! I'm kissing, Heckyl! You changed back, you're Dr. Heckyl! And I again must be, Dr. Hoo! (clicking) (laughing) (sobbing) (sad music) (screaming) - Look! (gasping) Ee-yew! (chattering) - Uh-huh, tickled to death. (suspenseful music) (crickets chirping) - Here it's, you she wants. (eerie suspenseful music) (knocking) - who is it? - It's only me, Dr. Heckyl. (suspenseful music) (latch clicking) - oh, doctor! (sighs) I thought you were that horrible Mr. Hype! - For a second I was. - oh... I didn't know you were a policeman. - Oh I'm, I'm not. - Oh... (door thumping) (tender music) Did anyone ever tell you, you have terrific eyes? - No... - [Coral] That's because nobody's ever really looked in 'em. - Somebody once told me though, that there was something tacky behind them. - No, no. Something, hometown, laid back, a, good time Mr. Mellow in there. - Oh you don't have the light on me, it doesn't kid me. I know I'm a hideous monster and a fool in love. But you know, I used to sit at the bus stop just to see you climb on the bus. It was love at first sight. And I've come here to say goodbye before I give myself up. - Don't give yourself up! Stay with me, I'll hide you! I mean I'm a liberated person Henry, I don't think you're ugly at all! When I look in your eyes I see that big, beautiful heart. - Oh, it's not me you see, it's the other guy the other evil, good looking guy! The guy that tried to pick you up from a stolen car and, and and and took the seat from the old lady on the bus and killed two women and, and made love to you last night, that's, that's what, that's what you see. - Oh stop jabbering and kiss me! (dramatic music) - This is the big, beautiful image you saw in the heart of the monster. (ominous music) This is too ironic to bear. You would love me when I'm a sweating, pimple bush, but now my life is complete you will cringe and spurn me. - Don't touch me! - It's a violation of the truth of nature, it's a violation of my own, inner truth. You have invalidated yourself. You give me one good reason why I should not kill you? - 'Cause you love me! - wrong! It's Heckyl that loves you, why not me? And (mumbles) being given a free pass we have a whole, new world of lust in front of us! You didn't mind the last time did you? - I didn't know you last time! - You'd rather make love to a stranger in the night than, a good looking fellow like me? (smacking) (tense music) Now you know the truth. I'm two monsters for the price of one. I can't let you love me, 'cause Mr. Hype's gonna come back and this time he's gonna kill you. - Oh, you lovely man, I understand it now. This is the last time we have together. - Absolutely. - But you deserve to have your dream come true. - Oh, you sound just like, just like Judy Garland. (tender music) - (mumbles) will come true. This minute, now, before he comes back. (snarling) - oh yes, (sighs)... (panting) My god (mumbles) can this be you... (poignant music) (hinge creaking) (gun clicking) Now's the time to rid the world of the ugliness of Dr. Heckyl, the evil (mumbles) die. - What about the goodness of Dr. Heckyl?
