The Goya Murders Laura Paterna. 32 years old. Partner in a law firm. Her wedding was in two months. That's one less divorcee at least. Who found her? The housekeeper. She gave a statement. Did you smell bleach right away? Yes. No trace of footprints or fingerprints. Santos hasn't found anything. Right? Nothing. Honey, I won't have time to pick the kids up. Can you do it? Yes, yes... Shall we take this too? Yes, it might serve as evidence... I'll call you later. Where's Laura? What happened? She's my fiancee. You won't tell me where she is... Excuse me. Are you a family member? I'm her fiancé. What the hell's going on? Thanks. The bedroom setting might suggest a crime of passion. It's not. Why so certain? Male-on-female crime isn't so subtle. The guys usually stab women, hurl them into walls, smash their heads in with hammers. Usually in the kitchen. You'd be surprised how often you find blood in the extractor fan. Carmen, I'm not a rookie. Good for you. What did the fiancé say? That he was at home. Alibi of the century... He said they had planned a date. But he was tired after work, so he stayed home. You were satisfied with that? If we're going to be partners, can you be more polite? I just remembered... I fired the maid and I've got nothing for dinner. Tetrodotoxin. Keep it simple, Ricardo. It's a neurotoxin. So it's quite rare, right? Luckily, since it's so nasty. It causes slow-acting paralysis while you're still conscious. You feel every moment of it, till you feel nothing at all. Go puke outside, Eva. Or better yet, just go home. She's the new girl. To the station and to the job. Don't mind her. Good day, your Honour. Inspector Eva González, Judge Octavio Marcos. You know Ricardo Morón. All right. What do we know? The victim's a 32-year-old woman. She was poisoned with... Tetrodotoxin. That's it. A somewhat rare neurotoxin. Time of death is estimated between 1 and 5 AM. No forced entry. A pro did this. None of the neighbours heard a thing. The toxin was injected here. Death then occurred 10-30 minutes later. The dress was put on with ease while the paralysis came into effect. Any longer, rigor mortis would make this impossible. She died in the position she was found in, as proven by the lividity that can be seen here. Staging a murder scene is typical of cold, methodical killers. They took time preparing for this. It might be a crime of passion. She was engaged. Maybe an ex-boyfriend... Crimes of passion aren't sophisticated. This is more complex. Very well. Good day. Good day. Don't undermine me in front of the forensic and the judge. Is this how it's going to be? It's illegal to smoke in cars. Come on, move it... I don't recognize the dress. It's not hers. It's too extravagant. Thank you. Was your daughter experiencing any conflict? At work, perhaps? No. She got on well with everyone. She entered the firm four months ago. She was so happy. She has a good character. She had... All her life, she was surrounded by friends. Always... She was an angel. Previous relationships? Only two ex-boyfriends. She only had stable relationships. She never had problems. Her wedding was in two months, right? Right. She was happy. The last two days, we've been planning her honeymoon. What do you think of her fiancé? Julio is a good boy. But? He didn't seem good enough for her. But tell me, what father doesn't think this? I need you to come with me to your daughter's home to see if anything's missing. Anything that grabs your attention, OK? You can reach me here. I'm sorry for your loss. Thank you, Inspector. My condolences. Carretero just called. Her ex-boyfriends' alibis are solid. I've got a meeting. I hope you'll be quick. I've told you everything I know. Or not. Excuse me? If you were really at home, could you tell me what you watched on TV? Right now, I don't remember. The news? A movie? I told you, I wasn't well. I think I went to bed. You "think" you did? Or did you "actually" go to bed? What is this? What about dinner? What do you "think" you ate? Listen... I'm asking you, don't treat me like a criminal. Let me remind you, my fiancee has just been murdered. Did you use your computer? No. I just spent hours on one at work. What about your mobile? What are you... We checked your devices. You weren't home... Can you listen? Why are you lying to me? Where were you? At dinner. With who? With a lady friend. Here's an email with the reservation. Call them, they'll confirm. You're such a nice guy. González... The restaurant's closed. I'll try again later. "Lady friend". That son-of-a... Watch it! Are you crazy? Look where you're driving! Can you slow down? Is it even legal to check devices? How did you do that? I don't believe this. He seemed quite upset to me. Of course he did. A yuppie social climber who's lost his golden goose. I feel so bad for him... Aren't you being a bit cruel? You don't even know him. You know what they say about not trusting first impressions? That's a lie. You've got no idea what's on my plate. The press won't stop. I need something. We're still questioning. Not enough. The politicians are on my ass. We can't just make up suspects. I'm asking you to tell me more. Why the rush? Without a motive or a suspect, I can't get to work. This isn't a normal crime. Nobody benefited from her death. Happy now? Good. How are things with Eva? Better? She's green, but she's doing her best. What are your weekend plans? What's it to you? We could rent out a hotel room and play Ludo, if you'd like. I prefer Snakes and Ladders. I've got a family meal to attend. Sounds exciting. But I can ditch it, if you like. Give it a try. I'll be waiting with the dice. They're calling me... Then let them call... Yes, Lourdes? Yes. No, sweetheart. When I left this morning, I wrote on the board that I'd be starting at 9 AM tomorrow. You take them to school, not me. Then what's the point of writing things down? That's what I wonder. All the tyrants embrace each other as brothers. Flashing the people their shameless bald spots. Mobs of beggars, two hundred students. Kick off the rebellion, it's the '60s. And there she is. There she is. La Puerta de Alcalá. And there she is, there she is, watching time pass by. La Puerta de Alcalá. I look right at her and became lost in her eyes. Her arches watch over me, her shadow stays by my side I don't try to hide away, nobody can fool her. All of life passes before her gaze. Look at her, look at her, look at her, look at her. La Puerta de Alcalá. Look at her, look at her, look at her, look at her. La Puerta de Alcalá... Hey, partner! Hey! One sparkling water, please. Make her a double, Oti. You'll need more than that. Sure thing. There. I'll get you another. Hey, it's my birthday. Won't you wish me happy returns? "Many happy returns", Eva. Everyone told me you were weird. Oh no... No, no, no! Shit! My husband's going to kill me. I said I'd be home two hours ago. If you'd rather sleep in a cell, you only have to ask. What? You really are a maniac. I'm going. I'm going. I need to get up early. We've got a dead body to deal with... How are Madrid's most beautiful officers? I'm fucking great, Mateíto. But I'm going now. Let me show you why. Just a second, where is it... Look! They're cute, right? They look just like you. What are their names? This one is Lucas, the baby. And this is Alex, the big one. Look how cute they are. Did I ever ask to see photos of your kids? You people are all the fucking same... You're taking this bad cop role very seriously. Want to go somewhere? Who? Me and you? Yeah. You're always saying we should go out. No, you're always saying that. You. I knew I'd find you here. But I never know where to find you. Well, as of now, it looks like that will change. What happened to you? Nothing. A minor 4x4 accident. Are you on disability leave? Not exactly. But who'd want a cripple in a war zone? Let's go. They don't know what to do with me. It could be worse. They could make you a sports reporter. No! I'd rather go to Syria. What do you know about that murdered rich girl? What rich girl? "What rich girl?" Come on... You're not that good with your tongue. A couple more nights with me and you'll tell me everything. Her wedding was in two months' time. She had also been promoted to partner in her law firm. She was on top of the world. Do you think the fiancé did it? How did she die? I didn't tell you, OK? Tetrodotoxin. Pufferfish venom. Look it up. You'll see how gruesome it is. And her name? Come on, I only know the initials. Eva'? Carmen, there's been another murder. I'm leaving now. Call Santos from the forensics team. I've got five minutes. If you're good, it'll be four... Two teeth are missing. He had been to the dentist. Not having a fun day, is he? Germán de Castro, 69. Retired. No family. Since retiring, he's been dealing in art. Live-in housekeeper? No chance. The maid found him at 8 AM. Did Santos say when the crime took place? No, but in all likelihood, it was early morning. Don Germán didn't have many friends. He would spend his days at auction houses. He'd send me to take a look over there and negotiate for pieces he wanted to buy. Did he mention anything out of the ordinary? Any conflicts with anyone? No, not recently. Although a few years ago, I don't know how many, somebody tried to break in. He always talked about it. Did he report it? Yes, but nobody was arrested. From what he told me, nobody saw or heard anything. At that time, he had just purchased a Goya print from an auction in Madrid. He was convinced somebody wanted to steal it. Who wanted to steal it? Ernesto Fraile. This is what he said, not me. Whenever a work by Goya was up for auction, the two of them would clash, with bids reaching indecent sums. Who's Ernesto Fraile? Another collector. An elderly man, like him. They'd go to all the auctions. Sometimes in Madrid, sometimes in London or Brussels. They both loved the Spanish Masters of the 17th and 18th centuries. And now, if you'll excuse me... This is giving me tachycardia. Please excuse me. Is anything missing? Let's go. These are Goya's Caprichos. We may be dealing with a serial killer who recreates scenes from these prints. They match almost perfectly. Same postures, same clothing, same positioning. Both victims lived in Salamanca district, close to Calle Goya, with similar social circles, related more or less to the art world. They were attacked in the early hours while they were asleep and defenseless. With the same poison. Laura's parents confirmed that she had a Capricho that is now missing. And Germán de Castro's art dealer also claims that a Capricho is missing. Typical trophy hunting for a serial killer. Here, it says that Goya made 80 Caprichos. Go visit the Plate Printing Institute. See if there's a link between the owners. As always, I expect prudence and discretion, OK? These crimes attract attention. We all need to keep our mouths shut. And I do mean all of us. Fine. Eva, step outside. Yes, Commissioner. There's no family meal now. I've made other plans. Anyone else? 770,000. 790,000. 810,000. Any further bids? Keep an eye on Mendieta. Very well, sold for 810,000 euros! Thank you for attending, ladies and gentlemen. We'll see you at next month's auction. Thank you very much. Thank you, Nam. A wonderful acquisition. One of this year's best pieces. You know how we adore Juan Gris around the house. Congratulations. How are you, Don Ernesto? Believe me, he's happy now. Glad to see you, Mister Fraile. Goodbye. Ciao, Nan“! Shall we be going? Come along. Ernesto Fraile? We'd like to speak with you. My husband is ill. He can barely speak. And we need to go. We'll just be a moment. I've been told that Germán de Castro would butt heads with your husband at auction. I don't know. Oh, you don't? Back then, my husband was in full control of his mental faculties, and didn't need my help here. You know that thieves attempted to enter Germán de Castro's home after buying a Capricho that your husband also bid for? If that's the case, I don't see why we'd know about it. We already own two Capricho prints, as well as Los desastres and El sueño. So you won't admit the rivalry? All collectors always want more. My husband wants... He wanted the world's greatest art collection. In that sense, they're all the same. You know de Castro was murdered? Yes, I read his obituary in the paper. I still don't see what this has to do with us. I'll kill Germán... Where is he? Ernesto, don't say such things. You see how he is. Sorry, we need to be going. If you remember anything about Germán de Castro's enemies, please call us. Of course. Please excuse us. Good day. Let's go. That bastard... Good day. What a bimbo. Sorry for the wait. Eduardo Gil. Copperplate researcher. Carmen Cobos. Police inspector. This is Inspector Eva González. Tell me, how can I help you? We want to know who owns a Goya Capricho. Did I say something funny? No, of course not. It's complicated. Allow me to explain... I expect you know that Goya created the Caprichos series as a condemnation of Spain. And he was also losing his hearing. He felt isolated, both literally and metaphorically. His affair with the Duchess of Alba? That's right. In 1803, amidst a complex political and personal situation, he gifted these 80 plates to the king for a stipend for his son. Right... So, these plates could have made infinite copies. Not infinite, no. But the first was made in 1799. There were more. And the last? 1970. Since then, it's prohibited to make more copies. But of course, there will always be fakes. So it's pretty much impossible to know who owns one. We know of a few famous people and families who have them. But between inheritances and auctions, it's impossible for me, or anyone, to write up a list of owners for you. Believe me, I'm sorry. May I know why the police are interested in this? No, you can't. But we're grateful for the help. A pleasure. If I can provide more information... Thanks. It'd be a pleasure. We've got nothing. I might know someone who can help. Alberto lectures in Fine Art. He knows Goya's works well... All right, sweetheart. So, what's there to know? Goya was a Francophile. He wanted to create a satire on society's vices. Bit of a weak lead, isn't it? Come on, eat up. Do they really need to be here? Yes. Fine. So how are we supposed to find out who owns a print? You could look into collectors? OK. The first victim had a Capricho. So did the second. Take a look at this. This article features people who own Goya prints. The autonomic president. We should check where other celebs live. The larger collections are owned by rich individuals. Investors aren't interested in the art. They sell when an artist gets popular. There are two kinds of collectors. Those who hide the art, then this lot, who don't need an excuse to show off the goods. People just love to brag. Hundreds of people own Caprichos. Many copies were made. So? Where do we start? Art attracts lots of people. Such as? Insurers, architects... Family and friends. So it could be anybody. At least we have a lead. You're such an optimist, Eva. Right, I'm off. Later. Well, your partner is charming. I know. What will you do? Find an apartment? I'll stay with my brother. Don't you want to stay here? Here in bed? With you? You know what I mean. I like not having a home. Maybe somebody should offer me one. Otherwise, you might disappear. Like you always do. At this time, he was already going deaf. I just love it. But it's very violent. It's an impressive collection. My husband and I are collectors. He loves Goya. Where did you get them? In London. There was an auction at Sotheby's. Are any of them original prints? Some are. They cost us a fortune. Madam President, we'll need to increase security. No, please. That's all I need. The populists will attack me for using public funds before the elections. No way. Think this over. All right, Julián. Do what you want, but discreetly. Keep the press away from here. Thank you. Cobos, González. Let's go. Excuse me... Aren't you a bit young for a sub-inspector? No. The victims share many commonalities. There's also the location, since all the events occurred within this one district. Their homes are here, and here. Circle theory suggests this area is important to the killer. Both of the victims owned Caprichos, now missing. Identifying all the owners would be impossible, but we've located a few here. A district full of collectors and antique stores. 35 in Salamanca district alone. Carmen? Have them watched. No. "No" What? We don't have the resources. We could watch 1O people, tops. So only the autonomic president deserves our resources? Carmen, I think he's right. That's just fucking great. What do we do then? I'll go call a fortune teller... Our job isn't to find potential victims. It's to find the killer. Understand? Get to work. Let's go over what happened... Adrián, call me. Just a bit more, OK, sweetie? All right? Just a little. How about it? Come on. Look, it's just a little. What the hell are we meant to do if we can't talk to the owners? What about renovations for luxury apartments? OK, if you won't eat... Let's break it down. Tomorrow, we check the surveillance footage... Can you please get him to stop? Excuse me? Volkswagen Transporter. Stop! Go back. We might get the license plate. Where was it? Parked out front. You can see it from the hotel's CCTV next to Germán de Castro's house. License plate? No. Just the colour and make. White Transporter. One guy got out, but you only see his height and build. Let's see where this leads us. I'll tell you where... As we already know, the murders occurred here and here. The person we're after operates in this area. The night of de Castro's murder, this van was parked outside his home around the same time. Excuse me? Yes? This isn't much to go on. You know who's calling the shots? González and me. We see a man with a broad build, average height, with a hoodie and bag. Look out for vans like this in the early hours of the morning, OK? What's so funny, Reyes? That's a popular model. Even my brother-in-law has one. Then tell him to come in for questioning. I know it's a shitty job, but there's no other way. Get going- It's a needle in a haystack. Yes? You know I don't agree with this. If he strikes while we're looking for... What do you suggest? No idea. But this is a waste of resources. You heard the commissioner. Don't you worry about him. I'll talk to him. So, you'll actually do something. Excuse me? It's always me patrolling every night. Why aren't you coming with? Don't you trust your husband? Don't disrespect me again. You know your problem? You've got lots of priorities. I've only got one. What is it, Reyes? Your patrol ends at 7. It's only 3. No, it ends now. I say so, Inspector. Finally... I thought you were dead. Since you're here, let's make the most of things. I'll be waiting. Bye. Report Carmen Cobos ♪2374/85040 The killer injects victims with tetrodotoxin, a neurotoxin that provokes... I wonder if anyone can see all the fun we're having. If they can, they might as well enjoy it. Listen... Sorry for vanishing these past few days. How's the case going? Not well then? It's not shocking, a killer targeting the rich. I hate those sorts of people too. People who think they can do whatever they like and nothing bad will happen. Eva, what do you want? In all probability, this man has experienced a lot of rejection and frustration throughout his life. According to psychologists, this is a person who is convinced the world around him is mediocre. This person is an elitist with lofty ambitions who can't find any success. This is what drives this tremendous violence against the privileged of society. Such as the upper classes of a city like Madrid? Exactly, the upper classes. The killer is attacking people who he believes act with impunity, like Goya did with his Caprichos, where he condemns human errors and vices. How did you come to these conclusions? This information came via my sources, sources I am not going to disclose. Do serial killers follow a pattern? Son of a bitch... The press will be down our throats, and it's your fault, so don't fuck with me! You know what happens with mistakes before elections? There are consequences. Nobody messes with my kids' future. Not even you. Call Eva. Tell her to come in. Come in. Come in, Eva. Carmen's taking time off. The case is yours. Get to work. Get to work! I'm really sorry about this. I'll keep you informed, OK? Carmen, please... Shut up. You hear me? Shut. Up. Son of a bitch! Eva? I might be going crazy, but I think I've found him. Principe de Vergara, 8. I think that's on the list of owners. It's him. Tell me if you'll help. Please leave a message after the tone. Eva, tell me you got the damn message! He's escaping! I'm right behind him! Call me! No, no, no... Shit! Come on! Come on, come on... Police! Turn off the engine, you son of a... I might be going crazy, but I think I've found him. The van was outside Principe de Vergara, 8. He's trying to run, Eva. It's him. Tell me if you'll help. Eva, tell me if you got... What? I need to go. Can you take the kids to nursery? Call me back! Fuck... This is González. An incident has been reported at Principe de Vergara, 8. Thanks. Police! Open the door! Police! What is it? Did you hear anything? It stinks of bleach, doesn't it? Who lives here? A woman. She lives alone. But the doorman has her key. Get out! The lock wasn't broken. It seems like the same MO. Who called it in? Cobos. What do you mean? You two are being a real pain in the ass. You were very lucky. Some bruising to your back and a sprained neck. Can I get some painkillers? Only paracetamol. Got anything stronger? I can only prescribe paracetamol because of your pregnancy. Why the hell did you get out the car? Don't you realise he could've killed you? I want you back on the case. If you didn't, you'd be a fucking idiot. Monica Luna. She owned an art and antiques store. She lived alone? She had four Caprichos, a couple Desastres, and other works. Did you see the license plate? Only part of it. All right. And this? ...about these crimes? This is what makes the Goya Killer so unique. Somebody is shining a spotlight on the art world: gallery owners, collectors, auction agents... Can you explain this? I've got no damn idea. I haven't seen him since. Carmen Cobos. All right... Ever suffered from a serious illness? Are you married? What's that got to do with anything? The number of sexual partners can indicate... Sorry, I'm not answering that question. As you wish. Do you smoke? No. Do you drink? No again. Have you been pregnant before? Seven years ago. Did you come to term? It was stillborn. Anything else? My secretary will call to book the intervention. Thanks. You're welcome. I'm sorry. I'm not proud of what I did... Shut up. You almost ruined my life. I'm back on the job, so I won't blow your brains out. Please, calm down. Calm down? This job is all I've got. And you still fucking used me... Commissioner, Adrián Iglesias. Pleasure to meet you. Wine? What have you been able to find regarding the Goya Murders? According to sources closely linked to the investigation, a suspect has been identified. The net is closing itself. An arrest could be made in the next few hours. From what we've seen, everyone is hanging on this case. This will allow us to change tactics. Now, we're going to start talking to the press. Sonia, the press packs. These outline what you can say, and what you cannot say. All right, Carmen? Excuse me. Yes'? Commissioner. I'm calling on behalf of the autonomic president. There's been a break-in. Please send officers. All right. The president's had a break-in. Carmen, Eva, to work. Thank you for coming, but please understand that we've just been through quite a complicated ordeal. Madam President, could it have been the Goya Killer? The only reason I'm physically unharmed and my belongings are safe is because our nation's security forces are among the best in Europe. I'll leave this to them. Will this affect your electoral campaign? We weren't able to catch them. How did they get in? The front door is intact, right? They used a service door. It wasn't guarded? Not then. Fucking hell... Luckily, the alarm system caught them. We were alerted, so we came right away. We found the president immobilized in a chair. Her hands and feet were tied, and she was gagged. The assailant, or assailants, were already gone. Who else was with you? Inspector, I'm Officer Miranda. This is Officer Barroso. We need to talk to the autonomic president. Tell her press secretary. That's not necessary. The commissioner insisted on taking a statement. Do you have to smoke here too? Both of them said the alarm tripped at the same time, at 5:42 AM. That seems quick. How did they have enough time to tie up the president? It doesn't add up. They said they didn't see any suspicious vehicles or persons. "Assailant or assailants"... They both said that several times. Nothing was caught on camera, except the agents entering the house. And this doesn't fit the killer's MO. And they contacted the press before us. Madam President, could it have been the Goya Murderer'? The only reason I'm physically unharmed and my belongings are safe is because our nation's security forces are among the best in Europe. I'll leave this to them. Will this affect your electoral campaign? This incident will bolster my commitment to the police, so they can access the best methods and resources during my next term. If the voters elect me, of course. There's no way. Whatever you're thinking... It was them. The president and the commissioner cut a deal to make a statement. Look, the MO doesn't fit, and neither does the time frame. Nothing was caught on camera. He's behind this. Before accusing him, we'll need proof. We'll leak the police report to the press. Are we 100% sure? About what? We can't pretend there won't be consequences. If you're scared, we can't do anything. I've got two kids. My husband doesn't earn much. You always hide behind your family, Eva. You should've become a housewife. It's so easy for you. You've got nothing to lose. Let's go over the plan, all right? You need to be careful. Follow it to the letter, OK? The plate... Can you hold this? First, it's covered with varnish. Then, an etching is made using a burin or a dry-point. Varnish is used for parts that need correcting. Once the image is completed, it's dipped in acid. Then it's removed and cleaned, ink is applied, then it's ready to be pressed. Did you make these? Before, I used to be an artist. But that was a long time ago. You haven't come to view my workshop. I saw you in a photo inside the president's home. Are you friends? I don't believe Alicia Márquez has any real friends. You didn't answer my question. We are. I've had many dealings with her. Besides this, people solicit me to value their works of art. To give them an idea of buying and selling prices. So Alicia Márquez is a client of yours. You could say that. I thought auction houses had their own experts. They do. But in this country, a lot of artwork is kept hidden away. Collectors don't declare their best works. Exactly. They'd need to pay a lot of taxes. The art isn't declared, but it moves. I hope this stays between us. Yes? I'm on my way... Sorry, I need to get going. Such a shame. I'll see you out. Come back whenever. Wait, play that back. It's a match. We've also got a partial license plate. Request ID from Traffic. It'll take a couple days. Excuse me... Carmen, are you all right? Need anything? I'll be gone a few days. Pass on any new developments, OK? Sure. I want your help. Of course. Anything. I need a suspect. We've got no leads and no time. If you help find the guy we're after, you'll land the exclusive. Thanks. I'll email you. All right. Adrián, this is all I can tell you: White Transformer van partial license: M 7... K. Slim man with beard, face hidden under hooded top. It's all right... There, there... The print guy said many collectors don't declare their artworks. To avoid paying tax, right? Artwork changes hands, but discreetly. Daddy will be here soon. It's all right... I bought them this. I liked this one. They'll need to share it. Thanks. Honey, I'm home... Hey. Sweetheart... Cowboy! Put your rucksack on. Alex, it's time for school... Come on, time for school. Now the other arm... What is it, Santos? OK, thanks... We've found the van. We need to get going, honey. We found fingerprints on the wheel and bodywork. And the bad news? The bodywork prints are probably from a botched attempt to scrap it. The wheel prints aren't on file. How many people? For now, just one. And we found a hair on the headrest. Give me the keys. What for? The keys, Santos. They're inside. Fuck's sake... Come on... In 200 metres, turn right... Eva? Ernesto Fraile's address was one of the last destinations. Let's go. Thanks. Have you seen this vehicle around here? I don't know anything about vans. Has anybody come in to do building work? Many people come and go in this house. Why not ask the staff? Of course. Thank you. Not at all. Good day. Good day. Do you remember seeing a white van belonging to someone doing work in the house? There was... a painter. He remembers a painter. Brown hair and beard. Does he remember a name? I've got no idea. Thanks. Adrián, Fraile's Wife found a business invoice: "Mafer Painting. OK, thanks. Did you find the owner? He died three years ago. Boss, look what we've found. Mafer. Operates in Madrid. Professional painting. Iván Santaolalla. Nobody knows... Nobody knows what art is. There's no way to objectify it, to validate it, or quantify it. This is an artist's greatest pitfall. In a society dominated by nepotism... ...and obsessed with money, an artist's work is transformed into a consumer product for the elites, into an empty frame that's only used as a mirror to reflect the power of the persons that own it. I've spent many years trapped in a labyrinth of failure. But this is not what art is... Carmen, call me. It's urgent. Failure is a fiction. I've spent many years trapped in a labyrinth of failure. I've managed to infiltrate their homes. I live off their breadcrumbs, but I only paint... He graduated from Bellas Artes in 2005. He had a few expositions the following year. Between 2008 and 2012, he gave culture classes in Daganzo. But no artistic career since then. He must have found another job to get by. Another frustrated artist. I live off their breadcrumbs, but I only paint what I want to paint. I think I'm gonna cry... The sole purpose of art is to elevate the soul. Come in. We've got the address. Let's go. Nothing. Get this door open. We don't have a warrant. Are you for real? Yes. What the fuck... Come on. Adrián. I saw your missed call. I'll try again later. Many crimes are attributed to him, including breaking into the home of Alicia Márquez. We now join Commissioner Vargas to discuss developments in this case. Good day, Commissioner. Good day. What can you tell us? We now have a suspect who is linked to the art world who fits our investigation profile. We've now put out a search warrant for him. Do you have the photo... This is the man we're after. So, you wanted to see me? How could you leak that? You're such an ass. I don't need to explain myself. He could only run or attack. Now we've shown his face, he can only run away... You haven't got a damn clue! It's easier to catch a killer when they're on the run! You don't give a shit! You don't give a damn if there are more victims. You only care about making an arrest before the elections and getting your fucking medal! Look at me. Have the balls to look at me. The presidential break-in... It was all you. Tell me I'm wrong. Tell me. Look, Carmen... If you even think about filling someone's head with your craziness, I will fuck up your life with a single call. I'll ruin your life. So think! The warrant has come through! Police! Hands up! Police! The roof? Clear! Police! A couple more nights with me, you'll tell me everything. Tetrodotoxin. It causes slow-acting paralysis while you're still conscious. Monica Luna. She owned an art and antiques store. Larger collections are owned by the rich. They cost a fortune. At the time, he had just purchased a Goya print from auction. They were attacked in the early hours while asleep and defenseless. With the same poison. A few years ago, I don't know how many, somebody broke in. All collectors always want more. 1970. Since then, it's prohibited to make more copies. Laura Paterna, 32. Partner in a law firm. She got on with everyone. People adjacent to the art world. People solicit me to value their art, for an estimate of buying and selling prices. It's an impressive collection. An auction at Sotheby's. A district full of collectors and antique stores. When they clashed, the bids reached indecent sums. They'd pay a lot of taxes. They're not declared, but they move. POLICE STATION I Iván, Ivan... Santa... Santaolalla... We're done here. Come on... One, three, five... One, three, five... All right... Belonging to: Eduardo Gil. Eva... I'm going to Eduardo's. Bring back-up. Iván and Eduardo were in cahoots. Get here with back-up... Bring in the stretcher. Right away. Go home. There's nothing we can do. I'll be right back. What is it, Eva? Sir, I need to go to Brussels. I'm pretty sure Eduardo Gil is there. Let Interpol do their job. This picture will be auctioned: the Julio Romero de Torres Carmen sent before she died. It belonged to a victim, but when we searched Gil's place, the painting was gone. If he turns up to the auction, we can prove it was him. None of the families reported the theft of any artworks except the Caprichos. Because those artworks hadn't been declared. Eduardo Gil knew he could steal them. Sir... I've been waiting a long time for this painting. Now it's finally up for auction in Brussels. Do we want to catch him or not?
