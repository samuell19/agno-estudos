THE DEMON The producer would like to thank professor Ernesto De Martino of the University of Cagliari whose funding made possible our ethnological studies in the south of Italy. This film is based on a recent and tragic true story. The rites, the spells and the demonic possessions you will see are scientifically verifiable and are a fact of life in Italy, just as they are anywhere else in the world. This is the story of Purificazione, a girl possessed by magic. A story that transpired during our time in Lucania. Wake up, Vincenzo! Wake up, boys! Lui, France! Time to get up! Purificazione! Hey, Pur?! Puri! Wake up, Puri! Get ready to go! Pur?! Pur?! What little shame she has. How dare she come to the church! Blood of Christ. Demon. A curse upon this man. A curse that he will never forget me. Blood of my body. Until the grave. A curse that he will never forget me. Good dog. I'll be back soon. Here, take this. Anto. - Good morning. - Good morning. Good morning. Sit, Antonio. Anto, why have you come here? To check on the hope chest of your fiancee? Do you not trust us? Oh I have no doubt that her hope chest will be lovely. As will be my fiancee. And as will be everything associated with her, if it pleases our Lord. I happened to be in the neighbourhood, and I thought I would stop in to pay my respects, And to see how you and your daughters are. About the ceremony, it's all decided. All the arrangements are taken care of. Just like they should be. I've already settled the accounts, and don't owe anyone. Neither God nor man. To God always, Antonio. We are always indebted to Him. You are right. But aside from Him, one must owe no one. And soon He will be the one who who must give something to me: Many healthy and honourable children. You would like to have many children, eh, Anto? Undoubtedly! And I've already figured out all of their names. But I cannot tell them to you. Because once spoken the names lose their charm and are lost. But only if they are spoken. - Mother. - God bless you, Antonio. Goodbye. What do you want? You already know what I want. It's been months since we've spoken. Why do you shy away whenever you see me? I've never said anything to you. What do you want of me? Did I ever pursue you? Did I promise anything to you? Leave me be, Pur?. It would be better if you didn't come around here any more. I said that I didn't want to see you again. You've never pursued me, but I am pursuing you. I want you. I have chosen you. Why don't you want me? Because I love another woman. And I am going to marry her. No! Why don't you want me? Tell me! Tell me you're scared of me! You must say it! Why don't you be quiet? Leave me be! No! You must tell me! Why you are scared? - You must tell me! - I told you to leave me be! I know what you're thinking, you're scared! But it's pointless of you to leave! I will be always be there with you! I will never leave you! Leave me be! I will marry with a woman, not with a beast! I want healthy children, not a dog that shouts at night! Damnned be the day I ever met you! If you do not want to see me again, and if you want me to let you alone you must do something for me. What? What do you want? Drink of this wine with me. You would honour me if you did. Imagine I'm not who I am, and you would not fear me, and you would not hate me. I will drink first. Take it. While you drink say: ?so that you rest?. ?So that you rest? those are the words of the dead. It does not matter: ?so that you rest?. - Say it. - You have already said it. That should do. With that wine you have drunk my blood! You have drunk my body and my substance! I have bewitched you! Now you will love me whether you want to or not! Have no fear! But if you do fear, all the worse! You will go to ruin! Misfortune will befall you! You will die! I have bewitched you! You will die! I want you. I revere you like blood. But you are a traitor. And I will ensnare you. We will be one through blood. I want you. I worship you. I love you and I revere you like blood. But you are? You haven't been sleeping. You haven't been sleeping. I knew it! That's enough! Stop it! Don't beat her! You're going to kill her! Stop it, father! Stop beating me! Vincenzo! Calm down! Stop it! Stop it! You're going to kill her! That's enough! Leave her alone! Vincenzo! I know it, I know what horrible things you've done! A death curse! That's the evil you've done! Leave her alone! You are going to kill her! Vincenzo, that's enough! That's enough! That's enough! Calm down! She is our daughter, she would never do such a thing! Let me go. Praised be God. Godfather, have I any other unions? You have none. - Godmother, am I tied to another? - You have nothing to hide. - You may wed, children. - You may unite. The candle is going out of the fiancee's side. It brings misfortune. Blood of Christ. Demon. A curse on him. A curse that that he will never forget me. A curse until the grave. Hey, stop that! Let me be! Let go of my staff! Help! Antonio! Antonio! Open up! Antonio! What are you doing? Don't you see that they're getting married? Let's go, Pur?, let's go, away with you! Please, Pur?, go away! Antonio! Pur?, go away! Away from here! What are you thinking, Puri? Stop it already! It's too late! In the four corners of this room There are seated four saints. May the four saints Bless this daughter of mine. May the four saints protect my son. No, my children, you may not enter yet. Only we the aged are allowed, we must prepare your wedding bed. With this scythe Cut short Death's legs. With this scythe Cut short the sorrowful voice. With this scythe under the bed You will protect them from demons. Here are the grapes that have soaked up all the evil that there is in this room. Here are the grapes that have soaked up all the discord. Here are the grapes purged of their juices that we arrange in the form of the cross. Dry, sweet, sweet grapes. You shall be the bait for bad thoughts. If they want to enter here, you will poison them. In the name of the Father, and of the Son and of the the Holy Spirit. Amen. The salt. Now the children may enter. Let's call them. You may enter, children. Stand guard here tonight. Don't move from here. - Arrivederci. - Goodbye. Good night. As this is born, so too will be born the first son. As this is born, so too must be born the first son! So must the first son be born! Look! Stop! Stop! Keep quiet. Be quiet. I know you. Pur?. Pur?. You are Salvatore. You have been ill. I know it. You have already cured yourself. Yes, I have cured myself. I am well. What are you doing? I am here watching the water. You like the water? I crossed to the east and came here in order to see the torrent. I crossed the same way, but I am feeling better now. I used to spend day and night here, without seeing anybody. Completely alone, nobody wanted me. A day spent here and no one could find me. Even if they looked for me. But I do not know if they looked for me. I'm late, Salvatore. They're waiting for me at the house. Goodbye, Salvatore. I am glad to have spoken with you, Pur?. And to have helped you feel better. Arrivederci, Pur?. Arrivederci, Salvatore. Ciao, Pur?! You've spent all morning away. You're still not thinking straight! You went to the torrent and you're still bewitched. I'm late because I was with Salvatore Collura. He was sick but he's feeling much better now. What are you saying! Salvatore Collura is seriously ill. Only today the priest brought him the holy oils. Pur?, Pur?, come back! Pur?! What are you doing here? Tell me, doctor. Tell me. How? How could this be? It can't be! He was fine when I saw him this morning! Crazy person! Crazy person! What do you mean this morning? He died this morning! What did you see? It can't be so, I saw him myself! In the torrent, he was playing by the water! He looked healthy and happy! The water, the water. Salvatore died requesting water. ?Mother, thirst, thirst, thirst? he said. She made him die. His soul went to look for water in the torrent and she wouldn't let to him drink! Quiet! Be quiet! What are you doing? A little respect for the dead! At least you, doctor! Let go, Father Tomaso. You shouldn't touch her. She will cut you. She will cut you! That girl has taken a demon inside her. There's a demon within her. Sorceress, more than sorceress! Sorceress! Sorceress! Sorceress! They see what I see. Walk with me. They see. come on. We leave our sins in the stones. Now confess. We shall shout out our sins. I robbed the hen of Rosaria. One had brooded in my hen house, in amongst my animals. It was a very beautiful hen. I robbed it. I have been a widower for 10 years. My daughter is 16 years old. I have thought of her as a woman. At night I entered her bedroom to see her sleeping naked in her bed. I have blasphemed against all the saints! Even against the name of Jesus! Father, forgive me! I threw my stepson out of the house, and told him not to return. I let him die of hunger. Father, forgive me! I have spoken with a demon! Virgin Mary, forgive me! I am damned! Damned! Damned! Kiss the Virgin! The Virgin who saves you from the demon! Kiss her! Kiss the Virgin! Uncle Giuseppe! Uncle Giuseppe! In the name of God, say something! - Uncle Giuseppe! - Uncle Giuseppe! You must have mercy on we, the sinful! Say something! Friends of Christ. What do you want? You must cure our daughter, Uncle Giuseppe! Only you can do it! She has been with a demon. The people flee from her. You must tell us whether she is bewitched or not. I will help you straight away. Have faith. Fix your eyes on the Sun and repeat with me: - Good morning, Sainted Sun. - Good morning, Sainted Sun. - At the feet of Our Father. - At the feet of Our Father. - You wash the anguish from our hearts. - You wash the anguish from our hearts. - The suffering from our minds. - The suffering from our minds. - Good morning, friend Sun. - Good morning, friend Sun. - Through the Saviour. - Through the Saviour. - Does the pain and suffering leave me. - Does the pain and suffering leave me. The Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. By the first Sunday that comes to pass I wish to stop my evil ways. By the first Sunday that comes to pass I wish to stop my evil ways. Take this, and turn back, daughter. To leave your evil ways behind. I will tell you the name of the demon who lives inside of you. It will be written on this paper. Clear your mind. Now breathe deeply. Harder! Harder still! You're not breathing hard enough, daughter. You have evil spirits in you and they guard themselves fiercely. You won't let me see them. I will have to think of something else. Stand straight up. Pious Saint Monica. Tearful Saint Monica, as you see the love of your son, so you see the love of Pur?. Now I see you in the mirror. Now blow hard, daughter. Now get on your knees, here on the lamb skin. Get down on your hands and knees. Thus. Now I will commune with the spirits in your shoulder. And now I will put this ring on your finger, You must allow your spirit and willpower to leave you. And the spirit that possesses you will do the same. Ant?, if you can't help me, I'll never be able to cure myself. People keep persecuting me. Ant?, why you don't you want me? I am yours! Ant?, hug me. Take my hands, like you did before. Never come here again. All the evil you want to do to me I will return upon you a thousandfold! I will make you cry! Do not show your face near my house, near my wife or near our bed! Do not dirty my house with your feet! Understood? Keep your distance from here! Keep your distance! Stop! Leave me be! I order to you, whoever that you are, oh, impure spirit, and to all your companions who live with you in this creature of God, that you say your name to me and the day in which you left hell. Along With any signal that will bind you to my will, a minister, although unworthy of God. No! No! Who are you? Who are you? I demand you tell me. I exorcise you, unholy spirit. And I order to you, squads of ghosts and legions of demons, that you separate, in the name of our lord Jesus Christ, from this creature of God. No! No! Touch her forehead to the ground. Leave her. Don't touch her. You will leave the body of this girl. It is useless to hide, impure spirit. Salt of the body of this woman. I order you to tell me who you are. - Are you Asmodeus? - Are you Leviathan? - No. - Are you Balaam? - No. - Are you Behemoth? - No! - Are you Isacaron? - No! - Are you Astaroth? - No! Daughter, my daughter? Kiss the cross of Christ. - No, no! - Yes, you will kiss the cross of your Lord. Never. - Yes, you will kiss it, revolting beast. - No, never! Leave this daughter of God. She belongs to him, to Him! - I want her, she is mine! - No, you will not have her. This girl is ours, is God's. Leave her, leave her, impure beast! - I hate you! I hate you! - All the better. You are nothing, worthless, you're powerless against me! I know that, but I hold the force of the cross to thwart you. I will not back down! Stop! Stop it! No, not? With clouds indicating an approaching storm, the farmers go on foot to Pork Pie because the only ancient magic they are able to draw upon is the rain falling across the sown fields. One: God, maintainer of the world. Two: the Sun and the Moon. Three: the patriarchs Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. Four: the four gospellers, Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, who sang the gospel in front of Christ. And you, ugly and dark cloud, why have you come? No. You stop near that area of darkness, where the rooster doesn't sing and the horse hooves don't tread. Go! Begone! Ugly cloud! Away with you, cloud! Go! Away from here, dark cloud! Get away already! Black cloud! Go! Begone! Low, low, low! Low, low, low! Low, low, low, low! Low, low, low, low! Low, ugly, low cloud! Go away, begone! Away with you! Ugly cloud! It is Passover, and you sit low in the sky, and if you rise you become smoke. Smoke. Smoke in the mountain. Low cloud! Smoke in the mountain! Go from here! It is Passover! Become smoke! Go away! Low dark cloud! Become smoke! The witch there, in that tree! The witch! She is the one that says that prevents it from rising! She is the one that brings the storm! She is the one that bewitches us! And she has cast a spell, as she put a spell on me! Let's go, don't let her escape! She's bewitched our houses! The witch! The witch! The witch! The witch! Holy Virgin Have mercy on us! What you have done, whore? Let's burn the witch! Burn her! Burn the witch! Burn her! Look! The smoke has turned black! It's her guilt! The witch! The witch! Look, look over here. Shoot it. Anyone who tries to leave this house will pay! Get away from her! This house is bewitched! No one must speak of Pur? again. So that nobody will bring harm to themselves. They must hide the act, bury it completely. As a shame of which they all must fear. Get to work, get to work! What are you looking at? Hurry! They'll see, help me. Carefully. If you hear anybody coming, don't move. They don't have to know that you are here. Understand, we're doing this for you. I swear. I'm sure she's still there. Open it, Vincenzo! Open it! What do you want? What do you want? Where is your daughter? You know where: in Potenza, with my family. - And she will never return here. - No, you do not speak the truth. You have hidden her here, under the earth. We have seen her. - You're all mad. - Then we will take a look at your hen house. We are going to open up the hen house. If you get any closer I'll kill you. Go back to your houses! We're going! Pur?! Pur?! Pur?! Pur?! Go try it yourself. Pur?! Antonio! There she is! Let's get her! Leave her alone, Leave her alone! Leave her alone! Pur?, Pur?! Leave her alone! Pur?! - Ant?. - Stop it! Stop it! You cannot stay here! If you stay here there will always be someone scared of you. You are dead to me. Leave! Beast! Leave! Get out of here! Go away already! Santa cross mine, she moves away of this house the witchcraft. With this holy crucifix, I purge this house of witchcraft. With this holy crucifix, I purge this house of witchcraft. With this holy crucifix, I purge this house of witchcraft.craft. She is definitely the girl from Bolsini. Luca recognizes her. She says that she is. The one that practices witchcraft, and speaks with spirits. She seems calm. She is a woman like any other. Why did we not remain with her? Poor girl. You should not keep her here in the convent, Mother Superior. Why not? If that girl is stricken, we must help her. How can we accomplish that? It cannot be done in a sacred place. In a fit of rage she'll break everything, spit on the images, and say certain things? Reverend Mother, you won't understand what she says. What you know you, Sister Chiara? But she is right. I was born in the field, near this area. And I have seen many like her, Mother. Yes, those creatures, when they become possessed by Satan they have the strength of ten bulls. And anything what smells of religion infuriates them. I order that this girl remain here with us. And this afternoon we will all give a rosary prayer for her health. I put her under your care, Sister ?ngela. She's your responsibility. Reverend Mother, come here. Reverend Mother. She's been walking about the tree from which Matthew hanged himself. With an air of certainty, as though she knows it. And now she speaks to it. She knows it. She knows it? Sister ?ngela, do not speak rubbish! How would that poor girl know one tree from another? Why did you want to touch that tree? What did you see there? What did you notice? It is not to be touched. Do you understand? Why not? There is nothing there. The dead do not return. You must regain your strength. You should not be doing these sorts of things, if you want to be healed. If you want to get back to normal. Do you understand? You need only say--do you know what to say? I will teach you. In the name of the Father, the Son and of the Holy Spirit. Help! They could lock you up. In an asylum. Do you realize that? If you want to stay here, you have to change. I want to help you, but you must promise to me that you will obey me completely. Do you want to stay here? - I don't know. - Come here. Come on, over here. You must learn to fear the sounds you are hearing, the voices that are speaking to you. It is all a diabolical phantasm. A force that seeks to bring you down. Do you understand? No! You don't know! You don't know! You don't know! It is all abomination. The things you see, the words you say. As is everything that you told me about that man that you loved, and the spell that you cast upon him. I am greater than you, more powerful than the other nuns, more powerful than everyone! I know what I feel, what I speak and what I see. And you don't. Always praying. And even though you marry, you don't know how to love someone. But I do! And that man, who is like you, He will be mine, I will remain with him. I will mold him to my will! Because I can, and you can do nothing! You Old monster! - No! - Ant?! - Blood? - It's only a dream, Ant?. It's only a dream. It doesn't come off. It's all over my body. It's a spell! She came to me in a dream, and where she touched me blood began to flow. A curse has been put upon me. It is a spell. A spell? - Do you notice anything? - No. You can't see it. The blood is disappearing and leaving those spots. Your whole body will be covered in spots, and soon the spots will open up. Is it really a spell? You said it, and if you said it, it must be true. Uncle Giuseppe, you have to save me! I cannot give you salvation or peace. I don't want to die! I must find her! I must find her if I want peace! - To Pur?! Really? - Don't speak her name. It's pointless to look for her. She hasn't left. She's still here. She left here, left! No. she is still in the air, in the water that you drink. She hasn't left. She is here, alive and present. To free yourself you have to burn the witch. On the night of the bonfire, the witches must burn. In this way you will free the air. You must take a consecrated log. And it must be from an old and withered tree. One at which the witch has visited, in which she has left her sign, giving the branches the form of crosses, hands and serpents. The older the log, The farther the poisoned air will go. To the bonfire with the witches! Burn them! The witches are in the air! To the bonfire! There will be salvation! The witches burn! Burn! Burn! Burn! Burn! Burn! Burn! Burn the air! Burn the air! Burn! Burn! Burn! Burn! The fire has won! The air has been cured! Burn the air! Burn the air! Tell me it was you who changed my life. Tell me and I'll be yours. Yes, it's true! It's true! Tell me you're a witch and they were right about you. Yes, I'm a witch! I control your life, your destiny! Find them and I will give back them to you! In the name of Christ, I release you forever! Born between lions and bears, and I sang the siren's song I am in this world as though I don't belong.
