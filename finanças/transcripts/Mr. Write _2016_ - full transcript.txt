NARRATOR: Love-- everlasting, all conquering, omnipresent, and paradoxically elusive. It was the promise of love that woke her from slumber each day. The sky was a canvas of cloudless blue. The sun warmed the fields like a sea of gold. The day of Alexandrine's wedding had arrived. The day she had been dreading. Alexandrine peered out the window as Jeffrey's horse came alongside. She threw the door open. Alexandrine nervously fidgeted with the lace on her dress. Her heart sank, because the carriage drew ever closer to the church. It would not be long now. Suddenly, the hypnotic rhythm of the coach horses was broken by a rapid gallop. A rider was approaching. It was Jeffrey. Ah. Excuse me. I'm fine. Thank you. NARRATOR: Jeffrey reached for Alexandrine. She held out her hand. Their fingers brushed. So I got home, and Tim's left this gigantic bouquet of balloons on my doorstep to celebrate our three-month anniversary. That's so sweet. Yeah, until they started popping at 2:00 a.m. We went out to dinner the other night. He kneeled down to tie his shoe lace and I blurted out, I think we're moving too fast. DORI: Ouch! I know. I really think you ought to break things off with Tim if you're not ready to make a commitment. I'm not big on relationships, but you're hardly one to talk. What? You got engaged after four months. It takes me that long to decide if I want to buy a pair of shoes. Yeah, but that's because I met the perfect guy. Say hello to Prince Charming for me. I love them. PHILIP (ON PHONE): Which one? I sent one bouquet to your office, and I sent one to your home. Oh, well, in that case, I love you. I was actually thinking about the color scheme for the flowers at our wedding. I love the fact that you're as excited about this wedding as I am. Oh, it's not the wedding I'm excited about. It's the girl I get to spend the rest of my life with. MAN (ON LOUDSPEAKER): Junior editors, to the board room. All right, I gotta go. I'm being summoned to a staff meeting. I'll see you tonight at dinner? PHILIP (ON PHONE): Yeah, Marcel's at 7:00. I love you. PHILIP (ON PHONE): I love you too. We are waiting on fact checkers to confirm the migration of the monarch butterfly. OK. Next-- untitled Michael Rothchild. Where are we on this? Last I heard he was having trouble with the second act. He said he would deliver something within two weeks. That was six months ago. I hate to say it, but I think he's washed up. OK. Have legal draw up a termination notice. Let's work on getting the advance back. Are you kidding me? Michael Rothchild is a master of his craft. His books are epic, but personal, but beautiful, but honest. Not to mention, he is one of the best sellers for this company. Was a best seller. Now he is a liability to our balance sheet. Well, his works are enduring because they come straight from the heart. I mean, every single one of them is dedicated to the love of his life, Sophie. I know I'm just a junior editor, but I would take one Michael Rothchild over 100 Gloria Ketridges. OK. He's yours. Excuse me? Michael Rothchild-- you believe so strongly about him, you got it. You're the lead editor. You have 30 days to deliver. OK, next item of business. I've got to put an end to this. Hi. Can I help you? I'm Dori Johnson. I'm from Lovespring Press. I'm going to be taking over as lead editor on your novel. What happened to Risi? Risi got pulled onto some other projects. Welcome aboard. Sorry about the mess. The maid comes on-- actually, I don't when she comes. I-- I just wanted to say what an honor it is to work with you. I mean, the way that you craft your characters, the way you tell a story-- Thank you. It's gratifying to know that I can touch someone's heart with the language of mine. Have a seat. Can I get you a drink, or-- DORI: Just water, please. MICHAEL: OK. So how is this um-- this book coming along? MICHAEL: Beautiful. Well, can I see what you've got? Well, it is bad luck to show unfinished work. (NERVOUSLY) Yeah. I understand. But, you know, I am-- I am gonna have to see it in order to edit it. You know, your hair is like the finest silk. (NERVOUSLY) I'm engaged. Well, things change. (HESITANTLY) Mr. Rothchild-- Oh, please. Call me Michael. I'm a professional, so-- I'm here to just do a job. So why don't you just give me what you've written, and I'll be on my way. Fine. Here you go. You haven't written a word in over a year? Honestly, I stopped trying a long time ago. Is there even a Sophie? Of course there is. Sophie? Hey, you. Got kisses for me? Oh, thank you. Sophie is your dog? Yeah, she's the love of my life. I fought really hard for this opportunity because I respected you. Don't judge an artist by his art. No, never again. Thank you for your time. I think that went well. Do you know any good places to break up with somebody? You were right. I can't keep stringing Tim along. I'm sorry. I'm gonna do it at lunch today. I hate this part. Well, it's probably going to go better than my meeting did. What do you mean? Did you get in touch with Michael? Let's just say, don't meet your heroes. What happened? He's a pig. I can't work with him. So I'll just tell Zev that I was wrong, and he can terminate the agreement. Dori, you can't do that. Why not? You went out on a limb for this guy. You put your neck on the line to give him a second chance. If you back out now, Zev will never let you be lead editor again. So, what am I supposed to do? Go back to Michael. Finish the book. Even if I wanted to do that, I didn't exactly leave things on the best of terms. So fix them. I came here because I wanted to apologize. Accepted. Wait! Can I come in? You cleaned up. Yeah. Turns out the maid comes on Tuesdays. Look, I think we got off on the wrong foot yesterday. No. I think that was a pretty accurate foot. I think that you are an incredibly talented writer, and it would be an honor to work with you. I'll just stick with Risi. That's not gonna be possible. MICHAEL: And why's that? Because Risi's working on other projects. I will call Zev and he'll move some things around for me. OK? Risi doesn't want to work with you. What? She says you're washed up. They have lattes in the city. Tim, we need to talk. Well, that is what people do on dates. I think you're a great guy. I just feel like we're in different places right now, but I know you'll meet somebody great, and I really do wish you the best. So I think it's time we go our separate ways. No. I can't write an entire book in 30 days. Well, if you don't deliver, they're going to send lawyers to collect the advance. And considering how many books you've published recently, I can assume you don't have it. No. I've never worked with another editor-- Well, I've never been lead editor before, so that is a first for the both of us. OK. We'll work out of my house. You can work there. I write in the office. OK. And I write on a typewriter, so you're gonna have to scan the pages into a program. OK? Well-- it's only 30 days. 30 days. Mm. See, I knew you were getting cold feet. Three months in-- right on schedule. What are you talking about? Well, your last boyfriend, Gary. How long were you together? That's just a coincidence. Oh, coincidence. OK. And the guy before that? All that proves is that I shouldn't have told you about my dating history. Pamela, there is no question that we have a great time together. We-- we like the same things-- the same music. We're both into old movies. Which reminds me, there is this black and white movie festival I would love for us to go-- But, Tim, it's not you. It's me. I know. I know. See, you-- you get scared the moment things start to get real, and then you run. I do not. Then give me three dates. You give me three dates to prove that this relationship is worth holding onto. Three dates is not going to change anything. Well then, you got nothing to lose. That is unless you're scared you won't be able to let me go. All right. You're on. Three dates. But after that, we're breaking up. Let the games begin. Michael is a great writer. He's just a nice, unreprehensible person. It sounds like. And this is so great for my career, but I'm never gonna see you. Dori? DORI: Yes? Can you at least maybe try your food before dinner is over? I'm sorry. It's just that the-- the wedding-- it's coinciding with the book's due date, and I've got all these preparations, and I don't know when I'm going to be able to get to it all. Hey. We are both getting married. I can take care of it. I can't ask you to do that. You're not. I'm volunteering. You go focus on what you need to do. When you're done-- I mean, I'm sure you're going to need a vacation-- we'll have our honeymoon. The timing works out perfectly. How is it that you always know the most perfect things to say? I think your romance novels are finally starting to rub off on me. You don't think we're rushing things? I mean, we've only known each other for six months. You know, I knew on our second date I wanted to propose. When it's right, you just know. Thank you for reminding me that there are still great guys out there. And thank you for ordering that chicken Parmesan. I am going to take it home with me tonight. Oh, yeah. That's good. Hey, everything's going to be fine. All right. So, you got Michael to work with you? You must have really poured on the charm. Yeah. That or the threat of bankruptcy. Well, it has been hard watching him can go down this road. He had real talent once. Well, he still does. It's just buried. Well, hopefully not too deep. He's been blocked for a long time. Good luck. Oh! Just the man I was looking for. So-- Can I help you? What is this? Just trying to liven up this polar ice cap that you call a home. Well, don't get too comfortable. You are here to work. - Yeah. Don't worry. I plan on it. Is this your family? Yeah. It's my mom, and that's my fiance, Philip. What's he do? A picture frame model? He is a contract attorney. And I couldn't ask for a better person. He's a real catch. Oh, yeah. That sweater is a real lady killer. How come you don't have any family photos up or anything? Something just to give this place, like, a personal touch? Because I don't spend my days looking at things from the past. I go out. I live my life. I don't disappear in books and fantasize about someone else's. I don't fantasize about another person's life. I'm very happy with my own. Well, that's because you've concocted your own fantasy out of knickknacks and stories and Philip von Sweaterton. How could you say that? You don't know anything about me. Well, you have toys, pictures of you parents, you love romance novels, and you're perpetually happy. I think I have a pretty good idea. Being miserable does not make you deep. No. But being deep often makes you miserable. Do lines like this actually work on women in the clubs? The shallow ones. The picture can stay. All the other garbage has to go. What? Excuse me? My house-- my rules. Hi, Tim. Hey. You ready for our first date? Look, this is very sweet of you and all, but you kind of caught me off guard at lunch, and-- Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa. You're not going to welch out on our bet now, are you? I just don't want you to waste your time. So you're free tonight? Sure. TIM (ON PHONE): Great. So then I will pick you up at 6 o'clock. OK. (WHISPERING) That's perfect. Michael, we can't use any of this. What do you mean? It's rote. It's cliche. And I think this is a line from a-- a pop song. Yeah. Oh, it's-- it's a great album. Yeah, well, you're gonna have to do better. It's no good. I stuck my neck out for you, and I promised to have a great book. How's that my problem? Lastly, I am not your social secretary, but while you were working you got calls from Jennifer, Hannah, and Kaylie. Kaylie Canter or Kaylie Demarcier? You know more than one Kaylie? Just because you don't get out much, doesn't mean I don't. These girls that you go out with-- do you even have feelings for any of them? Of course. I love them all. How could you possibly love all of them? Look. Love is chemical. It's temporary reactions-- endorphins in the brain. When they're present, you're in love. When they're not, it's kind of like what we have. If you think like this, how could you possibly write love stories? The same way you write about alien invasions, monsters under the bed, time travel. You make it up. Yeah, but I've always been taught that you write what you know. Well, if teachers could write, they'd be writers. Well, Michael, you better put your social life on hold, because you've got some re-writing to do. My neck-- my rules. I never thought that I would be homesick for my tiny cubicle next to the kitchen. Why don't you work from the office and have him work from home? Because he works on the typewriter, and I need to be there when the pages are done. Well, he can't scan and send them to you? Hm-mm. He does not have a scanner. What? Does he not know what year this is? Believe me, the technical hurdles are the least of my issues. I just don't know how we're going to be done with this book in time. I'm losing sleep. I'm gaining weight. That is exactly why we are hiring a wedding planner-- to take the pressure off you so you can focus on the job. I just-- I hate the idea of putting my wedding into the hands of a complete stranger. Honey, this is what she does. I'm told she's the best. Come on. Philip-- PHILIP: Hey, Robin. So good to see you again. You must be Dori. Oh, Hello. Hi. Look at you. You are going to be a vision-- slender figure, model cheekbones, sparkling eyes. Oh, they sparkle much more when I'm not so tired. Well, that's what I'm here for. What is that perfume you're wearing? Oh, it's Inclination. Do you like it? I love it. Well, I understand we've got a wedding to plan for in less than three weeks. (LAUGHTER) Yes, it's a bit of a short engagement. Please, the timeline doesn't scare me. See? And I think on top of the short notice, we're a bit concerned that if we're not doing the planning it's not gonna feel like our wedding. Yeah, and it's not that I-- we don't trust your taste-- It's my job to give you that day. You've already done so much. Let me sweat the details. That way, you can just relax and enjoy your day with this handsome, handsome man. Are you sure that you're OK with this? Because if you're not comfortable, we don't have to do it. I think this is exactly what we need. Who is she to tell me what's good and what isn't? I'll be the judge of my own work. PAMELA: What is it? TIM: Romantic picnic in the rain. Best seat in the house. If you really knew me, you'd know I-- I don't do romance. That's because you've never had it done right. No, I just don't have that romantic side most women have. You're an editor for a romance novel publisher. I worked at a restaurant in college, and I can't cook either. Although, clearly you can. This looks delicious. Mushrooms stuffed with cream cheese, Parmesan, and crab meat. Oh. Is something wrong? I'm allergic to shellfish. Oh, I guess that means the lobster ravioli is out to. Why are you going to all this trouble to keep dating? You-- you're real. For better or worse, you tell it like it is. You know, a lot of people they-- they want you to tell them what they want to hear. Whereas you tell people what they need to hear. That kind of honesty is a rare trait. And I think I could use some of that in my life. Careful what you wish for. I, on the other hand, I am optimistic and loyal, and I will always be there for you. And frankly, I think you could use some of that in your life. Oh-- What are you doing? Well, our date's not over yet, and I'd rather not end it with a trip to the emergency room. I'm ordering pizza. Hi. Where have you been? I went to a party last night. Yeah. Why didn't you let yourself in? I always leave the door unlocked. Do you really think it's wise to be partying all night when we're working on a deadline? In recent conditions, I think it's more than wise. I think it's absolutely necessary. Wait, is that lipstick on your cheek? When you gonna grow up? It is amazing how much you're starting to sound like my mother. What are you doing? I'm just gonna have a quick eight-hour nap and then-- then we'll get back to work. And what am I supposed to do for the next eight hours? Keep editing. I'm finished. He's gonna fire me. What do you have so far? Nothing. We have three weeks to go, and we have no book. Maybe you can ask for an extension. Yeah, maybe, because what we have now is garbage. It's terrible. How's the book coming along? Great. I'm getting some great stuff out of Michael. Glad to hear it. Michael was a very popular author before he took a break. We don't want to disappoint the fans. Well, it's going to be worth the wait, let me tell you. Excellent. Keep up the good work. What do you think he's going to say when he finds out? Well, I didn't really get that far. Congratulations. Now you're in even deeper. That bad, huh? The talent is there. I can see it. He's just-- he is not motivated. Maybe it's time to turn up the heat a little bit. What do you mean? Writers are like children. You have to be gentle and supportive and nurture their creativity. But every once in a while, you need to show them who's boss. Get creative. I had a writer once three weeks late with the printer on hold and pre-orders waiting to be shipped. I was desperate. So what did you do? I stole her car so she couldn't leave her apartment. You're certifiable. That is for the courts to decide. Anyway, the point is sometimes you need to take extreme measures to get what you need. DORI: I hope you had a good nap. What are you doing? I thought you might like some breakfast. Well, what are you doing now? I thought we were finished for today. We're not progressing fast enough, so I thought, you know, I should just spend more time here. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Yeah, I don't think so. Well, until this book is done, I'm going to be here from the moment you wake up until the moment you go to sleep at night. MICHAEL: No it's not imposing at all, because it's not-- not happening. OK? So you can just take your groceries and go have your breakfast on the picnic table. Michael, do you want to get rid of me? I'm listening. We are tied together until this book is done. But once you turn it in, you get paid. I get married. We go our separate ways, and then we never have to see each other ever again. Promise? With all of my heart. (SINGING) It should come as no surprise that the fire burns my eyes and the pain is overwhelming. Yeah. And now I'm standing in this, stepping fire abyss. The rock beneath my feet is melting. Like putty in my hands, but the more I can stand, the more that I can take it. I'm watching the storm come across the land. I will hold my ground and break it. But star, just remember that nothing is set in stone. I have nothing but life in front of my hands. When did she send it? No, I didn't get it. I am pretty sure that I would remember five pieces of cake. I'm looking for anything that I can stress eat these days. I would definitely go with the lemon cake with the raspberry filling. (SINGING) Your a setting sun. But the race is run. I saw that. (SINGING) The fox has won. When your whole world comes undone, just remember you mold the shape of things to come. When you believe that you're the setting sun, that the race is run, that the fox has won, then your whole world-- Hi, I'm Valeria. Is Michael ready for our date? He changed his mind. But he said my hair was like the fines silk. (SINGING) When you believe that you're the setting sun, that the race is won, that the fox has won. Yeah, we're just finishing up. Yeah, I miss you too. If you're done with your personal call, can we get back to work? You were saying something before wasn't working? Yes. Why would she leave him? Because the tornado's coming. Maybe it's not this scene. I mean, the whole thing kind of feels fake. Yeah, because it is. I'm writing a romance novel about frontier settlers. Yeah, but your other books-- they had real emotion. They had heart. Well, maybe your expectations about love are off. Haven't you ever had feelings for someone that were so strong that if you lost them you just-- you couldn't go on? I've had them. Then write it. All right. I got to go meet Philip. Yeah. Good night. Good night. I got that. Thank you. Magic night-- are sure about this? I am sure we're gonna have a great time. After you. Here-- and then there-- there'll be room for dancing over here. - Yeah. Yeah. And we can actually put the cake table over there as well. That's perfect. And then the band can set up right here. And then the dancing-- Dori, so good to see you again so soon. Oh, Robin, she was just catching up on our progress. Come take a look. Thank you so much for-- for meeting us so late. No worries. I actually have some tablecloth swatches in the back I want to show you. I'll-- I'll be right back. All right. So how's the book coming? The due date is two weeks away, and we're nowhere near done. Well, I'm sure that you're going to pull it together. You are amazingly resourceful, and that's just one of the many reasons why I love you. Thank you. I needed to hear that. Oh, by the way, my parents are flying in from London next week. It's just a quick stopover, but they want to have dinner with us. You want them to meet me like this? Well, it's either then or on our wedding day. Yeah, just with how hard I'm working, they're just going to think that you're marrying a lunatic. Well, you won't have to worry about working once we're married But I-- well, I like my job. I want to keep working. I didn't mean that. Of-- of course you're gonna keep working. I just meant, you know, after we have a family. Here they are. I'm sorry. I'm fine. I've never seen anything like that. I mean, that bird went right for your head. I know. For some reason birds have never really liked me. And our next date we are going to the black and white movie festival, because I know how you like movies. Ah, you know, one day our kids-- they are going to laugh about this. Our what? Well, you know, it's just that things haven't gone quite according to plan, and-- You said our kids? Well yeah, it's-- it was a joke. I don't-- I don't know if I want kids with you. I-- I don't know if I want kids at all. You are reading into this just way too much, really. Tim, I can't do this. You can't do what? I think you're a nice guy, but I know where this is going. I-- I don't want to hurt you. You know, I-- I think you're the one who doesn't want to get hurt. I think you're afraid of getting hurt, so you are coming up with any excuse you can just to, you know-- to call this whole thing off. You know, the problem is you can't have the highs without the lows. If you-- if you spend your whole life trying to avoid the pain, then you will never have a chance at real happiness. Dori! Hi. How's the Michael Rothchild novel coming along? Good. Great, because there's a ton of internet buzz. (HESITANTLY) Already? Yeah, we need to ride this wave-- nurture his fanbase. DORI: Sure. ZEV: I'm going to organize a reading at one of the local bookstores. We're still working on this. I don't think it's ready for the public just yet. No, no. Just a few pages from his first book. It was a huge breakout. He'll sign some autographs, talk about the new book. It'll be very casual. Absolutely. OK. I'll email you the details. - OK. OK? Great stuff. Come on! - No. Uh-uh. Not happening. We'll be in and out in just a few hours, tops. Nope. I hate those things. I stand up there signing autographs like an idiot. It's-- it's just a few pages from your first book. It's no big deal. No. I especially don't want to read old work. You know, if this goes well, we can ask Zev for an extension. This is a-- a chance to take some of the pressure off. Things were a lot easier when people had forgotten about me. Thank you. A little help, please. Oh, of course. Thank you. You'd think I'd be better at juggling after all these marriages. I figured Tim would do something like this. And you can put the flowers down anywhere. I'll take them back to my office. Oh, these flowers aren't for you, honey. They're for me from future husband number five. Oh. These are for you. Zev wants them done by the end of the day. Toodles. Are you nervous about the reading? No. No. I know how to read. Can you at least pretend to be the guy on the back of the book today? I know that you are repulsed by people that like your work. You're right. I guess sometimes it's just easier for me to be the jerk than to let my guard down. I guess I played the role so long I-- ah, sometimes I forget who the real me is. And then you came along and found him. Are you finished? Good enough. ZEV: Good afternoon, and welcome to a reading from one of romances foremost authors, Michael Rothchild. Michael will honor us with a reading from one of his earlier works, followed by a short Q&amp;A. Then Michael will be signing copies of his books. So without further ado, Michael Rothchild. Thank you. Why don't we jump right in? "Her lips were moist with the sweet kiss of morning dew. The fire had reduced to a cold pile of ash, but her pulse quickened when she remembered Quentin was returning that day. Victoria went to the kitchen and began her morning routine, but she found it impossible to concentrate. She longed for his strong embrace, his powerful kiss, and his sweet smell of-- the sweet smell of-- of--" garbage. How can you people read this garbage? I mean, is this what you think love is? Two people so connected that they would endure danger and all odds just to be together. I think you're going to find more realistic story lines over in sci-fi section. So these are just some of the complex themes that Michael will be dealing with in his new book. Isn't that right, Michael? Yeah, you know, love is never a straight line. It takes many forms. You know, a visionary like Michael helps us see that in the end, it really can move mountains. So we are going to take a bit of a break, and Michael will be right back. OK? Thank you. What was that? I can't be a part of this lie anymore. What are you talking about? These people crowd into sad little bookstores to read tales of epic romance and selfless devotion that doesn't exist in the real world. It's a fantasy, Michael. Not to them it isn't. And not to you either. You have this idealized sense of what a relationship is. And I don't think it's even about the person. You're in love with love. I am not a fool. I know the difference between fantasy and reality. Do you? Because when you talk about it, it's like it's coming from your heart. When you talk about it sounds like you actually believe true love exists. Yes! OK, yes! I believe. And look, I know that the world can be a really ugly place, and the odds of a relationships surviving are almost nothing. But I also know that there is love in this world. Now, I see it every day in the faces of elderly couples, in the eyes of young people meeting each other for the first time. Now, I see it, because I choose to see it. So if you would just open your eyes to the possibility that there might be something else out there, who knows what you'll find. You-- you rewrote chapter 1? Yeah. Couldn't sleep last night. This is really good. I mean, it's loaded with typos, but this is-- this is amazing. Well, I reread it and realized something was missing. I guess sometimes you have to open your eyes and take another look. You never know what you might find. So what's next? Are you going to reread chapter 2? Chapter 3. Way ahead of you. You got some catching up to do. (SINGING) The reason I tore up that note, was that I didn't know that I felt alone. Hi. I called in an order for take out. (SINGING) The feelings that I keep on hold open up a door I've been leaning on. I rewrote the letter so it would flow better than the first attempt I made. And all this time, I stayed-- Trade you. (SINGING) I stayed inside the lines. But life goes by while I wait for the right time. OK, change the Colonel's name to Bennington. Do a spell check on the final chapter. Format the footer, and, go with the mixed chrysanthemums for your centerpiece. (SINGING) I never have expected to change my point of view into us romancing. Does this work with the timeline? This scene here? Let's see. Yeah, I-- I think that works there. Robin got us the grand ballroom at the Westicott for that? What we save on that alone is going to cover a really good portion of her fee. Philip, I can't wait to meet your parents tomorrow. Marcel's at 7:00. And I was thinking for the rest of the evening-- (SINGING) --time I stay inside the lines. The lines-- PHILIP (ON PHONE): Dori, are you there? Yeah, yeah, I'm here. You were-- you were saying something about the out-of-town guests. Hey, Pamela. Tim. These are for you. Oh, that's so sweet. But you didn't have to get me anything. Well it's actually-- it's not a gift. It's just some books, you know, that you left in my apartment. Oh, right. Anyways I wanted to say that-- that you were right. You know, clearly this-- this isn't working. I probably should have let you break up with me the first time. Yeah. You know, at the end of the day, I think we are just-- we're just in different places. So-- hey, good luck. That's it? I hope we can still be friends. Dori? DORI: Yeah? I may have to go out for a bit. The ribbon on my typewriter ran out. Oh, yeah, can you pick up a butter churn and some stage coach grease while you're out? Very funny. You know, this typewriter's important to me. It was a gift from an ex. She's actually the one who encouraged me to start writing. Really? This is like, an actual living, breathing ex? Yes. Believe or not. I've had past relationships. What happened? You know, we were young and too in love to realize it wouldn't last forever. At least the typewriter survived. Do you ever think about joining the digital age? Yeah, yeah I have, but-- I don't know. The typewriter just feels more real to me. It's tangible. I mean, you can't just throw something down and erase it with the swipe of a mouse. It's-- it's paper and ink. When you type something, it's a commitment. I mean, you can shred it or burn it, but it's always going to be out there. It's a part of you, so you got to believe in those words. They have to say, this is what I stand for. I know it's crazy. No one seems to get why it matters, but it's important to me. Well, you can get the butter churn on your next trip, because I stocked up for you. Get to work. All right. He's amazing. I'm so lucky to be with him. Philip? Michael. I mean, this is just the beginning. We've got, like, so many great ideas. I don't want to get ahead of myself, but I-- I wonder if we can collaborate on his next book after the wedding. To Philip? To Philip. Yes, to Philip. I know Michael can come across a little rough. I mean, some of his first books are my favorites, but this new stuff it just has depth I've never felt before. Better not let your fiance hear you talking like that. Yeah, well, my relationship with him is purely professional. If you say so. Change in subject. I can't believe Tim finally gave up. I know. Just like that. Don't tell me that you've changed your mind. Not at all. I mean, it was nice to have someone who was completely convinced that I was the one, but this is right. Oh, in that case, congratulations on a successful breakup. Thanks. You know, it's just a story. It's wonderful. The words that every writer longs to hear, but never believes. I'm done for the day. Are you hungry? No, I never meant to get into romance novels. What did you want to do? Believe it or not, I actually started out as a horror writer. Yeah, but how did you make that jump? A story's a story. It's just in how you tell it. And every good story has all the elements-- adventure, romance, heartbreak, redemption. Why did you stop writing for so long? I guess it all started to feel a little too made up. They don't sound made up. Well, I did always have a flair for the grand gesture. The what? The moment, the selfless declaration of love usually accompanied by a room full of flowers or a band outside of the window. Yes, incredibly cheesy, but generally effective. That's because people want to believe in love. It's the idea. It's the promise. The idea that true love could be standing right in front of you, and you don't even know it. Which is why I'm-- I'm so lucky to have found Philip. I mean, we've only been together for six months. It's been a bit of a whirlwind, but he's amazing. I mean, he's my best friend, and I can count on him to be there and he can count on me. What day is it today? The 3rd. Oh my! Oh, no, no, no! What's wrong? Yeah, I was supposed to meet Philip's parents about an hour and a half ago. We'll talk. I'm so sorry. Don't give me that look. (SARCASTICALLY) Thank you for coming. I forgot. Yeah, my parents-- we had a lovely time. I am so sorry. I told them that you got in a fender bender on your way here. Then, of course, they wanted to come see you and make sure you're OK. And I told them that they would miss their plane. If there is any way that I can make this up to-- I've-- I've got an early meeting tomorrow, so I better get home and get to bed. All right. RISI: I flew to Rio and he stayed in Cabo. Talk about a jet-setting lifestyle. Anyway, he turned out to be a bit of a creep. But it was fun while it lasted. Oh, black-and-white film festival. You gonna go? (SADLY) No. OK. Hey, Dori, I've been cooped up all day. You want to get out for a bit? DORI: That's a great idea. Great. Yeah, we can go for a walk, get out to a little ice cream stand I like. DORI: Yeah, I miss you too. I won't be much longer. I'm counting the days. Yeah, I saw the wedding announcement. You looked so handsome in that picture. I think I'm going to be working late tonight. TIM (ON RECORDING): This is Tim. Leave a message. Hi, it's Pamela. I-- you said that we could still be friends, so I'm wondering if we could have a friendly dinner. Call me. I have great news. Oh, what is it? Well, let me rephrase that. I have great news for me. An old flame's in town, and I have a date. Oh, OK. I guess I could-- I could just stay here and just work late. Dori, why don't you take the night off? We're on schedule. The book's going great. OK. Just go out to dinner. You can surprise your fiance, Wendell. It's Philip. Whatever. Yeah, just the two of you guys go. You've earned a night away from my charms, huh? Yeah, but remember, tomorrow we have to review the arc of the third act. Yeah, did I mention she's only in town tonight? And Zev wants to see a revised ending to chapter 22. Dori, good night. OK. Oh, but wait! Have a good time. Well, are you going to invite me in or not? Can you believe they made that book into a movie? My stuff is way classier than that. I'm just not into it. All right. Dori! DORI: Hi, honey. What you doing here? Well, that's not a very warm welcome. You better get used to this. Till death do us part. Can I come in? Of course. I-- I-- I thought that you were working tonight. DORI: Well, Michael has a date, so I have the night off. OK. You don't have plans, do you? No. Well, good, because I thought it's been a while since we've been to Manzano. Oh, sure. Let-- let me go get changed. Well, what's the rush? I mean, I haven't seen you all week. I'm so hungry. I want to get to the restaurant. Well, don't I get a kiss first? How about a real kiss, please? Philip? Why do you smell like Inclination? Dori-- With our wedding planner? I better not find out that she's been billing us for those hours. It was one little kiss, OK? Can we please talk about this? Oh, by all means, I would love to hear your explanation. We were just working on the wedding arrangements and it happened. OK? I stopped immediately. I felt terrible. It's just that I-- I don't ever get to see you anymore and I-- I miss you. Well, you better get used to it, because you're never going to see me again. You don't mean that. Dori, we're getting married in a week and a half. I promise it meant nothing. Is that supposed to make me feel better? No. Dori? I think I overreacted a little. Things were going just fine. I guess I just needed a little space, but I think you're a great guy, so I'm officially un-breaking up with you. No. Are we going to do this every time? I like you, Pamela. But I want to be with someone who wants to be with me. I-- I want to be with you. Things were just moving a little fast. I was just joking about the kids. Really. I know nothing's for certain, but if we were going to do with this, I need to believe that we have a chance at a future. I just don't think there's a chance with you. Good-bye Pamela. Wait! You said three dates. We've only had two. Are you saying you want me to take you on another date? No. I'm taking you out. Come on. I already gave you three pieces. Dori! What-- what are you doing here? (SADLY) The wedding's off. My friends used to say that he was too good to be true. I just never thought about it literally. I mean he always said the right thing. He looked the right way. I guess he was too good to be true. I'm really sorry. Maybe he's right. Maybe this is partially my fault, because I have been spending all my time here consumed with this job. Wait. Hold on. Look, take my word for it coming as a guy who probably used that excuse himself. So then what do I do? Do I take him back? Do we-- do we break up? I don't know. Well, if this was a scene in one of your books, how would you write it? If it was a scene from one of my books, the right guy would probably be somebody else. Dori, you deserve better. Oh, I don't know. I get so caught up in the fantasy of what I think a relationship is. You were right. I'm in love with love. No, I can't. I can't. Michael, I don't want to-- I don't know what I'm doing. I think I'm falling for you. Michael. Wait. This whole thing sounds familiar. Yeah, this is a line from-- this is a line from one of your books. Oh my-- I'm such an idiot! I can't believe that I almost fell for that. Fell for-- what do you-- Dori, this-- this isn't an act. You have no idea how hard this is for me knowing that you're going to marry somebody else. Please, you're just adding insult to injury right now. Dori, wait! PAMELA: Black and white. You do have it? Oh, yes. Ship it. I don't care how much it costs. It's for a very special guy and a very special night. OK. Thank you. Dori? PAMELA: Knock, knock. You got a minute to talk about the last round of edits? Is there something wrong? Well, you missed several typos, highlighted misspelled words that were spelled correctly, and replaced every instance of the word "love" with "trash." Is there a problem? Pamela, when was the first time you fell in love? Roger Lauren. Sophomore year in college. What happened? I fell in love with Roger, and then he fell in love with my roommate a week after that. I was five the first time I fell in love. He was so dashing, so regal, so virtuous-- Prince Fuzzlebottom. From the cartoon? I feel like I have been chasing that ideal ever since an impression made on me at five is still controlling my adult love life. It's time to grow up. I would have thought a month with Michael would have cleared up any illusions you might have had. No. Michael was the worst. Because he made me believe. What's that noise? I don't know. What's going on? Beats me. Looks like someone went to a lot of trouble to make a grand gesture. Philip? I love you, Dori. I don't ever want to lose you. Well, it's a little late for that. Dori, will you please still marry me? (WHISPERING) What are you doing? Growing up. Yes. Michael? Rebecca? Hi. It's been a while. You look good. You too. So-- it's a little awkward. Why's that? I-- if I recall, we didn't end things on the best of terms. Well, we went out for a month and half, and then you stopped acknowledging my existence. So I do remember correctly. Rebecca, I want to apologize. For what? For anything that I did while we were together-- and anything I didn't do, for that matter. Well, there goes that plan. What? For the past year I've had a speech prepared in case I ever ran into you again. But you kind of took the wind out of my sails. I was that bad? Yes. But eventually, I realized I learned a lot from you. And I'm with someone who's really good to me now. I'm really glad to hear that. It's really good to see you, even if it's reminded me of what a jerk I'd been. It's good to see you. We're gonna have the main table right here, right by this giant window. Sweetheart, the grounds look amazing. It's beautiful. We'll put the stage right here, and we'll have the band and the dance floor and-- Not now. I'm on a roll. PHILIP: Michael Rothchild. Michael Rothchild. Michael Rothchild. I do not know how we're going to fit all this stuff into my place after we get married. Well, don't worry. I'm not taking all of it. Wow. You look like you stepped out of a bridal magazine. This is really happening. It's not too late. You don't have to go through with this if you still have doubts about Philip. No. No. I-- I'm just not so sure about me. WOMAN (ON TV): What are you thinking about now? MAN (ON TV): The path I was taking. WOMAN (ON TV): What about it? PAMELA: Ta-da! This is quite the setup. We missed the black-and-white movie festival, so I ordered the best projector I could find, had it rush delivered, rented "Farewell to Arms." I thought you didn't do romance. I'm opening myself to a few new things. Pamela, this-- this is really nice. But-- Let's take it a little bit at a time-- see where it goes. Maybe one day, down a very long and uncertain road, our kids will laugh about this? Or maybe we can make something up. WOMAN (ON TV): I'd be very glad to have you kiss me now, if you don't mind. TIM: This is the best part. We're here! I don't actually have to wear this. Do I? My brother told me to protect you from all the eligible bachelors tonight. You ready? We're ditching her inside the club, right? Stop it. She's my future sister-in-law. When does her flight leaving again? TRUDY: Dori! Dori! Found them. Dori, come on! Hey! It's me, Valeria. We-- we met at Michael Rothchild's. Oh, yeah. Right. Don't tell me. You and-- you and Michael are getting hitched? What? No! We work together. We-- we used to work together. We don't anymore. Oh I-- I thought that explained it. Explained what? He doesn't call. He doesn't return my texts. Really? I talked to some friends, and they say they haven't seen him at the clubs or parties. The way he's been acting, I thought maybe he'd fallen in love. Anyways, congratulations to you in the future mister. I'm sure he's an absolute dream. Dori, are you coming? Yeah. I gave use strict instructions not to leave me alone with Trudy. Good to see you. How's it coming? Almost done. Thank you so much for letting us use your house to get ready. Thank you for not making me wear a hideous bridesmaids dresses. And you look beautiful. You know that Tim offered to drive my parents to the church? You've got a really good one there. You're smart to hang on to him. Being in an actual relationship is kind of nice. I'm starting to get what you see in it. Dori? There's someone at the door for you. Wow! Look at you. You look like a princess. What's up? I just thought I'd stop by and bring you your wedding present. Thank you. But you didn't have to come all the way just for that. Ah, nonsense. I wanted to wish you luck in person. Ah, by the way-- that fiance of yours. Hubba-hubba. Thank you. I'm just sorry that you're not going to be there. Oh, trust me, honey. I am bad luck for weddings. By the way, nice job on the Michael Rothchild book. Thank you. He is a remarkable talent. Yeah, he-- he can be. We were very close back in the day. He and Sophie actually came to my third wedding. He brought his dog as his plus one? Not his dog, honey. His wife, Sophie, when they were still together, that is. I didn't know that he was married. Well, they weren't just married. She was the love of his life. High school sweethearts, they went through college together. He-- he never said anything about that. Well, I'm not surprised. She broke his heart when she left him. I never thought he'd get over her and start writing again. PHILIP: Hey, how are you? You look so beautiful. Thank you so much for coming. Welcome. He, mate. - Hey. - What's going on? - Big day. Man, I thought it would never get here. Oh, yeah. Here we are. - Good luck. Thank you. All right. Hey. Smile. It's supposed to be your wedding day. How's that? Work on it. Come in. The guests are starting to arrive. Oh, thank you. I know we don't know each other very well, but I just wanted to tell you how grateful I am that you made me a bridesmaid. Oh, of course. I mean, you're-- you're Philip's sister. Well, not have after today. In a little while I'm going to be your sister. Ah, sisters! Sisters. Hey, we'll see you soon. DORI: OK. Thanks very much, everyone. Tuesday at the latest. Yeah. MICHAEL: Hey, Zev. Here it is. Well, I'll be darned. I wasn't sure if you had it in you. I think you're going to like it. Well, if it's anything like the stuff that I've already read, we've got a bestseller on our hands. It's good to have you back. Thanks. Hey, I want you to know, Dori was instrumental in making this book happen. Yeah, I know. We're promoting her to senior editor. Good. Well, I guess I better get going. And, do me a favor. Just tell Dori-- just tell her thanks. Soon as she gets back. Oh, she's gone for two weeks. I thought you knew. No. What for? Her honeymoon. Ceremony's today. She's still marrying that guy? Maybe in a few minutes. Where is it? That's private information, Michael. You know I can't give that out. Right, right, right. So if you'll excuse me, I'm late for an appointment at the church on First Street. ZEV: Hey, hey, hey! I'll bring it back. Ready? Michael! What are you doing here? All right, you better get inside. I need to talk to you. Don't marry Philip. Why not? Because I love you. I'm not the characters that I write about. I don't know if I can give you a happily ever after. But you make me want to try. I don't want happily ever after. I want you. How are we gonna get out of here? We have a church full of people waiting for a wedding. Does this work? Yeah, that'll do. Give this to Zev. Mm-hm. You got this. Go! Thanks. Dori? Hi. Bye! Wait! My shoe. My shoe. You want to just drive away? I told you I had a flair for the grand gesture. Why didn't you tell me Sophie was your wife? I wasn't ready to let her go. I am now. What time is it? I don't know. It's like, a quarter till. OK. What? Philip-- What? What? Excuse me-- wait, Dori! Wait, wait, wait. Where do you think you're going? I have a date. We're getting married. Come back inside. You can't leave everybody-- all these guests here. I already paid for this wedding. Take it up with the wedding planner. Oh! I guess sometimes you have to open your eyes and take another look. Who knows what you'll find. (SINGING) The reason I tore up that note, was that I didn't know that I felt alone. The feelings that I keep on hold, open up a door I been leaning on. I rewrote the letter so it would flow better than the first attempt I made. And all this time, I've stayed inside the lines. But life goes by, while I wait for the right time. The tingles that I get off you, when you walk into the room make me feel like dancing. I never have expected to change my point of view into us romancing. And all this time, I stayed inside the lines. But life goes by, while I wait for the right time.
