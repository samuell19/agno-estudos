A grade 7 student was found without underwear and the uniform was pulled up in one of the banana plantation at Tigaon, Camarines Sur. Also found beside the remains... We can no longer watch good shows right, Mom? Yes, you're right. The 15-year old student was on her way home... Mom, I'll go ahead. - Sure, take good care of yourself. - I will. I'll go ahead, Mom! Here it is, thank you. Can you do it? Okay. Mom, why are you outside? How come you don't have a boyfriend yet? Mom, it's not an issue to me. I don't have time for those things. And I still have a lot of things to do in life. Like what? I want to provide for you, send Dad to a good hospital, I want to work abroad, so that I could earn a lot of money and lift you up from poverty. You know what, my dear? You're the only one we're relying on. I truly hope that you can lift us from poverty. Don't worry, Mom, it will come. Isn't my daughter the best? Next time, play the billiards properly. - When we're drinking, don't cheat! - Bro, wait. Hi, fair lady! Leave me alone. - Hold on a second. - Don't touch me! - Don't I look good? - Her skin is so fair. - Bro, you can start courting her. - Touch her. - You are all so disrespectful! - Hey, hey, wait! - She's a girl. Stop disrespecting her! - You, stay out of this! This is none of your business! - Hurry, man! - What now, huh? - Hurry, bro! - Bro, wait for me! Miss, are you okay? Are you going home? I'll accompany you home. I have a tricycle. Thanks so much, ma'am. Here. Have some snacks. I feel so embarassed. I should be the one treating you, since you saved me from those disrespectful scumbags! It's okay. Next time, you can treat me out. - Thanks. - It's nothing. Even if I see other girls being disrespected, I will still do the same. You usually go out from work this late? Yes, because I am the one incharge of our area. Okay, if I ever pass by, I'll accompany you home. Who knows, you might encounter those scumbags again. - Have some. - I'm good. I'm okay with this. The fight got really intense, right? I forgot to introduce myself. My name is Ben. Margo. It's okay. Just finish eating. Do you still want anything else? No, it's okay. I'm good with this. It's nice here. I'm a regular customer here. Yes, sometimes, I also pass by here. You shoud try their bread. And their custard as well, it's delicious. Where should I bring you? You didn't even ask if I will be doing something today. Then, after your market duty. I'll pick you up. Okay, then. - Go get inside now. - Right. - Okay, good night. - Good night. - Go ahead. - You go inside first. No, you go first. Sure, I'll go ahead. - Good night. Bye. - Okay, good night. I love you, bye. Mom. What will you get from Ben? He is just a tricycle driver. How about your dreams? Why didn't you choose your rich suitor? He has a car. Mom, I like Ben. And even if he is my boyfriend, it doesn't mean he will be my husband. It is not yet part of my plans. Besides, there are a lot of things that can happen. I am just reminding you. Your future depends on it. It will be better, if you will stop it. Before something unpredictable happens. I'm glad I am early. The trip is not so good. Dude, I heard you and your girlfriend have been together for a long time. When is the wedding? It's not yet on our plans, bro. Besides, you know the situation, right? Living is very hard. And one more thing, I am still supporting my sibling's education, so that they can finish their studies. You're a good man, dude. But I heard that someone rich guy is courting your girlfriend. He even has a car. Think about it, dude. Your girlfriend might change her mind. I don't think so, dude. - Margo! - Hey, Jayson! Where are you going? Where you heading? Are you on your way home? You want me to accompany you home? I apologize, Jayson. I already have someone to accompany me. Margo! What is he doing here when he knows you have a boyfriend already? Margo, I'll just go ahead. - Bye. - Okay, I apologize again, Jayson. When will he ever stop courting you? What are you talking about, Ben? It's so embarrasing. - Come on. - Hey? Let's go! Why do smell alcohol? Are you drunk? Will you slow down? You're drunk. Just a moment. We'll just talk. What are you saying? This is no longer the way to our house. Take me home. - This won't take long. - Ben! Ben, I'm begging you, please take me home. Ben, please! Where are we? What are we doing here? It's so dark! Where are we? This is not our place. What are we going to do here? What are we going to talk about? Why here? You love me, right? Prove it. What are you saying, Ben? You're drunk. I love you so much. - Ben, you're drunk. - I will do everything for you. - Ben, what are you doing? - Prove your love to me. Ben, what is this? - Ben! Stop! - Prove it. - You love me, right? - Please stop. Stop! Stop. Please, stop. Just a minute. You're late. - Mom. - What happened to you? There was a lot of vegetable delivery in the market, so I took advantage. - I'm going to sleep now, I feel sick. - Okay, go ahead. - You love me, right? - Stop. Prove to me you love me. Ben, stop. I'm sorry, Margo is not feeling well. - My dear! - Friend, what happened to you? Are you okay? Do you want me to bring you to the clinic? - Aunt Pina? - Go ahead. Let's go, friend. We'll be back soon. I'm sorry. Congratulations! You're pregnant. How come you don't have a boyfriend yet? Mom, it's not an issue to me. I don't have time for those things. And I still have a lot of things to do in life. I want to provide for you, send Dad to a good hospital, I want to work abroad, so that I could earn a lot of money and lift you up from poverty. Margo! Margo! Margo, Margo! Just a minute. Margo, I'm begging you, please forgive me. I just did it because I love you so much. - Margo, I don't want to loose you. - I'm pregnant! And I want you to know that I'm not happy. I'm not prepared yet. I still have a lot of obligations to my family. Margo! Mom! Dad! - You're early. - Yes. - Hey? - I will tell you something. - Your son seems to be so happy. - What is it? What is it? Mom, Dad, you will have a grandchild already! What? A family of your own? Who's going to help us? Who's going to send your siblings to school? Wait, just calm down. Mom, hold on. I will not take you for granted. I will still help you. I won't abandon you. Whatever! Dad, we have to talk to Margo's parents now, because Margo is not yet ready to have a baby. She doesn't like to have the baby. She wants to abort our baby. What? That can't be! I won't let her abort my grandchild. She must fear God. And I will not let her. - Mom? - Okay, I'll do what I have to. Tomorrow, we'll go there. - Don't worry. - Yes, Dad. Sir, madam, we're here so we can talk about our kids. Maybe Margo already told you that we will be having our grandchild? Margo! Margo! Are they telling the truth? Are you pregnant? Answer me. Yes. By the power vested upon me by the Republic of the Philippines, I am blessing your marriage, from now on and by the witnesseses this day. Now, you are married to the law of the people and in the eyes of the Lord. A round of applause for them. Congratulations! You may now kiss the bride. Ben, don't. I can still remember what you did to me. I'm not ready yet. Margo, that was a long time ago. And besides, we are already married. Maybe, you should forget about it. - Let's start again. - No. I still can't forget that. Buboy! Look how sweaty you are! You keep on playing. Don't you have assignments to do? Take a bath now. Do your assignments as well. Come on. Margo! - Margo! - Mom? - What is it, Mom? - Tintin is having a very high fever. What? - What now? - She's so hot. Come on, give her to me. Mom, I'll bring her to the hospital. Watch Buboy for me. You're still not done with that? We had so much laundry. Anyway, I visited Barry. He knows someone who can help us work abroad... in Saudi. I was just thinking, Margo, that the kids are growing up. Our expenses are also getting higher. So, I think that it is time to start applying to work abroad. And where do you think you can get the money to be used there? I'm sure, you'll be spending so much before you get hired. I'm thinking of asking help from Dad. Maybe I can talk to him to pawn the tricycle. Then, if I get the job, on my first salary, I will get it back. Are you sure about that? Let's just try. We have nothing to loose, anyway. Let me. Come on, help me. Dad... Yes, Ben. What is it? Dad, I want to tell you something. I am planning to apply abroad, in Saudi. Saudi? Yes, because you know, I want to help you, and for us to have a better life. Buboy is already studying, and our expenses are getting heavier as well. You know, that's a nice idea, but I have a question. Where will you get the money you will spend for the application? Dad, if it's okay with you... maybe we can pawn the tricycle. But, Dad, on my first salary, I promise, I will get it back. What if you won't get it back? No, Dad, on my first salary, I will get it back. Because my salary there would be higher. Not to brag, Dad. So, I will be able to pay it quickly. Okay. It's just that this is how we earn. This is where we rely on to pay for your sister's school expenses. But, Dad, I promise you, I won't disappoint. First salary, Dad. So what do you say? Okay. Sure. You know, we rely our lives here. But of course, if it's for your family and our family's good... Are you sure, Dad? Is it okay with you? What else can I do? Just don't forget that you have to get the money back, okay? Yes. Yes. I will ask for an advance if needed so, I can get it back. Thanks so much, Dad! Sure. Come on, help me. - Sure. - There's a rug there, get it. Twenty five thousand pesos is needed for the processing fee of your papers. If you can give the money sooner, I'm sure I can squeeze you in to the ones who'd be flying next month. Thanks, Mr. Kanor. So, see you next week? You have to bring all your documents you need. Yes. Let's just meet here again. Sure. I'll complete them as soon as possible. - Okay, see you next week. - Yes. Barry, I'll go ahead. - Alright. - Thanks again, Mr. Kanor. Barry, I think this is it. Attorney... Ben, this thirty thousand pesos. Don't forget every month, the interest is ten thousand pesos. Okay, I promise you. Just one month, I'll return your money. So, you can ask again next time. Yes, so I can ask again. - Attorney, thanks so much. - Okay. Mr. Kanor, I apologize, the traffic was bad. - I thought you changed your mind already. - No, no, here are the documents. They're all complete. How about the money, do you have it? Oh, yes. It's complete as well. - Good. - Good, right? Good, okay then, I won't stay long because I am meeting somebody. I'll see you again next week for your ticket and Visa for Saudi. Sure, we will meet again here? Yes, here. I'll go ahead. I am in a hurry. Are your papers complete? Yes, I organized them all. Tomorrow, I will be meeting Mr. Kanor, to get my Visa and passport. So, this is really it. Ben, I hope that this will be the start. Don't let us down, okay? Yes, of course, this is all for you. - Okay, I'll just finish this. - Do you need help? No, it's okay. I just have to sign here. Okay, you can do it. I will just cook. Excuse me, sir. Your coffee, sir. Can I have a candy? - Candy? - Five pesos only. May I ask a question? Do you know someone named Barry who lives around here? Yes, Barry. That's his house. But he left the other day. He went to his province. - Went home to the province? - Yes. How about a guy named Kanor? Do you know him? Kanor? That is his house. But he left last week as well. Maybe he is hiding, seems like he victimized another applicant again. - Thanks. - Alright. Ben, what happened? They ran away with the money. What? They ran away with the money. We were scammed. How did that happen? I thought that your friend knows this man? I don't know. I gave too much of my trust. Ben, go to the police station and file a complaint. I don't know what to do. How did this happened? I am so stupid. I trusted them! We can't let this go. Go to the police. You cannot let this go. Are you drunk? It's too early to get drunk. Where have you been? What? You're acting weird. How was your appointment? - Oh, this is— - We were scammed. What? What did you say? They ran away with our money. We were scammed, Dad. Dad, sorry. Why? How did that happen? I don't know. We needed that. What will happen to us? You knew that the tricycle was our only source of earning, right? What are we going to do? Dad? Dad? Dad! Dad! Mom! Mom! Dad is— Dad, what's wrong? Mom, something's happening to Dad! Dad! Call an ambulance! Hurry! Ask for help! - Dad! - Len, faster! I'm sorry, we did everything we can. The patient did not survive. That's not true! This cannot be true! Brother! Dad is gone. Brother. Dad! Where are you going again? Do we have food? I'm hungry. We have rice, I'll just buy you dish, sir! Drunk again. Hey! You bastard, my father died because of you! Ben, I'm sorry, I was just in a tight situation. I lost in gambling. If I won't pay, they will kill me. I will kill you! You animal! Kanor? Kanor? What have you done? Kanor! Sir, do you have a detainee named Ben Santiago? Yes... - Sir, please accompany her. - Let's go, ma'am. Thank you, sir. Santiago, you have a visitor. Ben. What did you do? I didn't mean to. I was just shocked. I didn't mean to. Even so. You shouldn't have done it. We will be having a bigger problem. I might not be able to take this, Ben. You knew that we have so many problems, yet you added another one. What do we do now? Miss, though you have a lawyer, your husband won't be able to get away with this, because he himself was the one who admitted the crime, and there were a lot of witnesseses around. I think you should talk to the family of the victim. They might pull out the case, or lessen the sentence of your husband. Are you related to Mr. Kanor? Yes, I'm his wife. Why? I'm Ben's wife. The one who accidentally killed your husband. Yet you still have the decency to come here! What do you need? I'm here to plead for you to pull out the case first? Why? Can you bring my husband's life back? Or you can just pay me instead. 300,000 pesos. If you don't have it now, or anything left to offer, just let your husband rot in jail. Go away and leave! I'm sorry. I am really sorry, Ben. I already asked our relatives, friends, and the people we know but I can't find someone who can help us with your case. Just let me stay here. Don't worry. I will be able to get out of here, in God's mercy. Just take care of the kids. No, you cannot go with me. I have a meeting. Next time, okay? Hon, I'll go ahead. Don't wait for me. I might come home late because of the traffic. - Sure. - Bye. Bye. - Bye! What about my kiss? - Kiss Papa. - Whoa, bye. - Say bye to Papa. - Bye-bye. - Bye. Tell Papa to come home early, come on. - Come home early. - I will. Your slippers are broken. Come on, let's fix it inside. Okay, here's your toy. Please hold it. Okay, careful. Sir, do I have a visitor? None. Thank you. What do you want to order? Anything, you decide. Waiter! I want to order two coffee, and two cassava cakes. So... How are you? How's your life? I have two kids already. And my husband is in jail. That's why I am working so hard to support my family. You, how are you? Do you already have family? Yes, two kids as well. Your coffee. Thank you. Thank you. Why is your husband in jail? What did he do? He killed the illegal recruiter who ran away with our money. He was shocked because his dad died because of that. That's it. You, why are you here? Me? Nothing. I just visited a relative here. And I will buy some things for our business. Try it, it's delicious. Yeah, it does look delicious. Waiter. I want to order one box of cassava cake. - One box? - Okay. One box. It seems like you're visiting a party. No. That is for you. Bring it to your kids. Jayson, no, please don't bother. That's no problem at all. Anyway, it's not often, right? Just give it to the kids, okay? Thank you so much. Come on, try it. It's delicious. Margo, here's my calling card. If you have a problem or if you need anything, just let me know. Okay. Thanks for this. Thanks for the cassava cake as well. - Take care. - Good night. Margo! Margo! Mom? We rushed Tintin to the hospital. Her fever is not getting low. - She is having a convulsion. - Faye, please take in charge here. - I'm sorry. - Tintin is in the hospital. - The tricycle is waiting. - Let's go, Mom. Ma'am, the total amount is 1,200 pesos. Can you please choose the important ones? I only have 500 pesos here. I'll just go back for the others. Yes, sure. I am really sorry, Margo, but you know that we are not earning much in the store. You still have advance last month, amounting to 3,000 pesos. I can only lend you five hundred pesos. Please, I'm begging you. Please add a little more. You can get it from my next salary. I just need it badly. My daughter is in the hospital. I need money to buy her medicine. The truth is... your salary is not enough to cover up your debts. But then, I will make it one thousand pesos. But I will be deducting all of it on your next salary, okay? - Doctor. - Hello. How's my daughter's condition? Her condition is not good. I think there is a complication. She has pleghm. So, there is a secondary bacterial infection. She is having a hard time breathing. That is a sign of her comvulsion, a very high fever. So, our impression is, the patient is having a broncho-pneumonia. So, we have to act fast. And we have to observe her. What do we need to do, doctor? She has to be confined, so the medicine could be administered easily. We will induce through the dextrose. So, she can recover easily. And then, we will do a chest x-ray to identify other complications. - Alright. Thanks, doctor. - Alright. Be strong. What are we going to do now? I can't even find a way to buy her medicine. What are we going to do? God has mercy, my dear. We will get through this. - Friend! Friend! - Yes? How's your daughter? She is still in the hospital. I don't know where I can get the money to settle the bills. Even the money for the medicine is short. Friend, I have some spare money. Don't worry as soon as we get our salary, I will lend you money. Friend, thank you so much. I promise, I will surely pay you. Don't mention it. I know friend that it is still short. Why don't we call that rich guy who likes you? He might lend you some money. It's for Tintin, right? Here, let's call him. Call him. Go on. - Are you sure? - Yes, it's for your daughter. Go on. For Tintin. You need money, right? Go ahead, call him. I'll go work again. Hello! Who's this? Hello, Jayson. It's Margo. Margo, how are you? Why did you call? Because I have a problem. I don't know who else to ask for help. What is your problem? My daughter is in the hospital. I really don't know where to ask for help. You are the last one I thought who can help. You might want to help me. No problem, Margo. Okay, don't worry. I'll go there. I will go to your place. Yes, thank you, thank you very much. Jayson, I will pay you, I promise! It's okay. Don't mind it. What's more important is that you would be able to pay the hospital bills. Yes. Thank you so much! Okay, bye. Friend! Friend! For you. It's Jayson. Hello? Jayson, how are you? Why did you call? Nothing, just wanted to ask if you're okay. How about Tintin? How is she? She's okay. She is recovering. Thank you very much. No worries, I told you, right? Whatever you need. I will go the city tomorrow. I wanted to invite for dinner. If you're free. No, you don't have to. You'll be spending again. I told you, don't mind it. I'll pick you up, okay? After your work. See you tomorrow. Okay, sure. See you tomorrow, bye. Okay. Bye. Who are you talking to? Why does it seems to be very important? It's the supplier. There is a problem with our orders. What did they say? It's not too much of a problem. I can manage it. I will just go to the city tomorrow to fix it. Come on, let's go inside. Jayson, this is not the way to my house. Jayson, where are we going? Please bring me home. It will just take a while, Margo. We will just talk. Margo... I love you. I will not let you down. Even your kids. Jayson, you have a wife. I, too, am married. This is not right. Just bring me home. Kosa, somebody told me... that your wife is having an affair. Are you telling the truth? Kosa, if you are lying to me, you will regret it! Kosa, it's true. Because one of our kosa's wife is living just near your house. And one more thing, the suitor is rich. He is even using a car when he visits your house. If you are telling the truth... when I get out of here, they will regret it. Friend. Friend! Why are you so sad? I have seen that for quite long now. Nothing, I was just thinking. I have a lot of problems at home. Oh, because I thought you were thinking about Jayson. You are so naughty. You keep on saying ''Jayson''. I told you, it's nothing. Stop pushing it. But to be honest... I really am just thinking on how I can have a better life. Friend, you know what? My friend's friend left yesterday. She went abroad because I heard there is a document holder to the UK. There is no required qualifications but we need money. What do you think? Let's try it. Friend, where are we going to get the money? I can't even pay for my daughter and Dad's medicine. It's hard for me to look for money. I have too many debts. I have an idea. Why not ask and borrow again from Jayson? He really likes you, right? I'm pretty sure, he will not turn his back on you. I can help you organize your papers and go to London. But how much do we need to prepare? And how about our lodging when we arrive there? Well, 260,000 pesos for the total payment. You will pay for the ticket and embassy. We will out your documents. But for now, you'll just pay half of the total amount, okay? Then you will bring the other half and pay there in London. How about our lodging and jobs there when we arrive? When you arrive in London, you will look for your own job. Because I will just enter you in as tourists. But I know someone there where you can stay until you find a job. I need the money in one week. And when we arrange the documents properly, you can leave the country within a month. Friend, we will be needing a large amount after all. We might not carry it. Promise me, if you ever get there first, help fund me so that I can go there as well, okay? Friend, I myself am not sure about it either. I'm not even sure if Jayson will even lend me money. There's too much tension. Jayson, you animal! You bastard! Who is that girl? Who are you? Why are you with my husband? You flirty animal! Please don't make a scene here. I'll kill you! Jayson, you animal! Friend, have you talked to Jayson? Did you tell him about aboad? No, friend. Something happened. What? His wife came at the restaurant and made a scene. I was so embarassed! What? That's embarassing! Didn't know you had the guts. So, what? Was it like Famas acting? Stop it, okay? - It seems our abroad is impossible. - Well... Let's just keep this, come on. Hello? Margo... how are you? I apologize, I didn't know my wife will come. She followed me. It's okay, Jayson. I understand. I have something to tell you. What is it? Jayson... I know I'll be asking too much... I know that I owe you so much already but, I really need a big amount. I am planning to work abroad, in the UK. How much money do you need so you can go? 260,000 Pesos. That's all in, including the ticket. That is really a big amount. You might be scammed again? I don't think so. Because my friend knows him. And the first payment is just half of the total. Then the other half will be collected when we arrived there. Don't worry, Jayson. I will be paying you everything, if I find a job there. Okay, I will be going to the city the day after tomorrow. So, I can accompany you to your agent. Okay, sure. Thank you very much, Jayson. Thank you so much. Alright. How are you? I thought you will not come back. One week had passed. Do you have the money with you? So, I can start processing your documents. Do you have the pictures? - Yes. - Yes, we have it here. - And the pictures as well. - Just make sure that you wil bring your show money. James will get the money from you when you arrive in the UK, okay? - Here is the payment. - Thank you. We will be able to go, friend. I want to tell everyone of you that sooner, I will be able to give a better life. I will be able to buy medicine for Dad and this is also for Tintin whenever she's sick. I will be able to buy you new things for your schooling. Mom, do you have a new job? I applied to... Abroad, in the UK. They said, I can earn a lot there. I can send you what you need. You are going to leave us? Dad is not here, yet you will leave us? It is just temporary, my child. This is all for you. And if I did my job well there I will bring you there, we will live there. You will study there. How about Daddy? I will save money. So, I can pay for his case and let your dad free. Where will you get the money? Jayson lent me the money. Then I will pay him, after I get a job there. Mom, this is it. I will fulfill my dreams for you. To give you a better life. But you know, I am feeling nervous. What happened to Ben might happened to you as well. I don't think so. Our agent is very nice and I will be leaving with Faye if ever. Margo Santiago. Congratulations! You'll be leaving next week. Finally, friend, we will now fulfill my dreams. Our dreams. Hello, Jayson? I just wanted to tell you that our Visa has been approved. We will be leaving next week. Thank you so much for all your help. Don't worry, I will not forget my promise to you. I will pay you. Thank you very much again. What are you doing here? I thought you have forgotten about me. I was just busy working and to our kids. To our kids? Or to that other man? Ben, I came here not to fight with you. I am here to let you know... that I will leave for abroad. I will be leaving tomorrow to the UK. Who will take care of the kids? Mom will take good care of them. We need this, Ben. So, we could have a chance at a better life. So, we can support our kids. Their schooling. I need this so I can save for your case. Where did you get the money? From Jayson. Is he your other man? Ben, he is just a friend. He's nice. He was also the one who helped us when Tintin was sick. So, we can buy medicine for her. He is also the reason why I can leave. I am in debt to him. Ben, you have to understand and trust me. If I leave, my depth of gratitude to him will lessen. I can pay him for my debts. Right? I can't do this without you. Margo, I love you so much. I love you too, Ben. Mom, please don't leave us! Please stay beside us. Don't worry, my child, I will be back soon. - Mom. - Be good. I will miss you. Stay strong. - It's okay. - Take care of yourselves here, Mom. - You too. - Tin. Just stay strong. - Take care of the kids, Mom. - Yes. Take care. Just pray. Take care. Stay strong. Say goodbye. Let's not look like we're sad. Mom will be sad as well. Let's smile, let's smile. Your mom is leaving. We're okay. The travel time is very long. So, cold. Come on. Get inside. So, welcome to my humble abode. This is the kitchen. There are two rooms upstairs. So, come in. So, this is your room. It's not that big but it's very comfortable here. Thank you. Atty. Pacheco asked me to let you stay here in my house until the time you find a job. For the meantime, you can stay here. There's a double deck in one of the rooms upstairs. Both of you can fit in. But once you find a job, you will have to pay me the rent. 250 Pounds per week. That includes water, electricity, and gas. But the food is held by you. We only share the kitchen, toilet, and the shower. - But we have to keep it clean. - Yes. And one more thing, if someone asks how you were able to come here, - tell them you are students, okay? - Yes. - Students. - But why? Because those who have a tourist Visa are not allowed to work here. But if it ever comes to their knowledge, you will be deported. So, you have to be careful. Okay. Thank you, sister. Thank you, sir. - Friend. Friend! - What? I am so sleepy but I can't sleep. I feel so excited. Finally, we can now fulfill our dreams. I am hoping so, friend. I hope we can fulfill them all. Go to sleep. Let's go to sleep. We will be starting tomorrow. - Okay, good night. - Good night. Come in. - Hello. - Good afternoon, Ms. Nedy. They are the ones looking for a job. Margo and Faye. Okay, alright. Go the HR so you can start tomorrow. Alright, tomorrow. - Okay. - See you tomorrow. - Alright. - Thank you. - Bye. - Thanks, again. Excuse me? Where is the HR Department? Do you have an appointment? - Appointment? - Okay. We wait. Don't worry, it's just through that, take a lift, turn right and you'll see her office. - Thank you, thank you. - What did she say? Just there. Let's find someone to ask again. - Where is the HR? - Are you Filipinos? Where are you going? To Ms. Nedy's office but we didn't understand the receptionist. Maybe she's wrong because she said you left then right. No, it's lift not left. But it's lift, it's an elevator. - Oh! - Anyway, you go staight ahead. When you go straight, you take a lift. The elevator, on the first floor, you turn right. You will see the sign there, head house keeper. There is the office. - Alright. Thank you. - Okay. - Thank you. - Thank you, sir. What the hell? I don't have any idea. That the elevator is the lift. Friend, you are so beautiful. The uniforms fits you well. How about me? Of course. It's perfect. - Hello. - Hello. - How are you? Are you good? - Yes. You know, the personnel manager here is my friend. That's why I can get employees here working without papers. But of course, not permanent. Just part time. Casual. You will be working the whole afternoon, and you'll get paid. So, it's good. But if somebody asks you, tell them you've been here for long. Refrain from talking about your status here. You know, it might spark some jealousy. So be careful. Yes. Thank you so much for all your help, Ms. Nedy. No, don't mention it. Just be good, work harder, so you won't get any attention. I hope your papers will be okay, and organized. What can we do to have good documents? - So, we can get a permanent Visa? - Yes, right. The best way is to marry a British man. Now, you can also marry a Filipino as long as he has a permanent Visa. That is the easiest way, since they can bring you here. Another thing is if you have an employer who will sponsor you. Or a student Visa. But that is expensive because you'll be paying your tuition every year. That is a huge amount. So, the best way, since you are yet married, is to get married here. It's really hard to get a permanent Visa, isn't it? Indeed. But many are still lucky. Of course, some are not so lucky. They've been here for 20 years yet they are still not a resident. But don't worry. In time, you will be okay. Just be patient. Thank you, Ms. Nedy. It's okay. Friend, it's so expensive here. It seems to be taking all our earnings. Friend, we don't have any choice. Even we go home now, we will not have anything to eat there. If we will not eat now, we will starve. So, let's just eat expensive now. Next time, we'll just eat more in our staff canteen. Alright. You're right. - Come on. - I'm hungry. Faye, hurry, change your clothes. The immigration officers are there. They are looking for illegals. Margo, hurry! Change your clothes. There are immigration officers downstairs. All the chamber maids here have their legal documents. They're all valid to work. Otherwise, they won't be working here because I do check their papers. Anyway, we got Donna here. They're just here to check your papers. Which door is that? Who's supposed to be cleaning this floor? Actually, the chamber maids are suppose to clean this floor. She's got an emergency, so she has to go home. But she has valid documents, I can assure you that. If you want to check it out, you can come back tomorrow by all means. - Can we check this room? - Yes, feel free to check it. What are you doing there? Come here. Come out. Sit down. Don't be afraid. The immigration officers already left. You know, you have to be strong here. Things like these really happen sometimes. So, you can go home now. I will just be doing the tasks left for you to do. Stop worrying, okay? Come back here tomorrow. Your job today is still paid. Okay? That's enough. It's alright. If you want, you can go to the canteen - you can eat before you go home. - Yes. Alright. You change clothes before you go home. Thank you, Miss Nedy. Don't mention it. It's okay. Friend, what are you doing there? Friend, I'm glad you arrived. I've stayed here for like an hour already. I was so afraid of the immigration officers. They might follow us, ask where we live and catch us. Friend, we are just hiding from our job, because we are not allowed to work. But to live here, it is still okay. Our Visa is still effective for two months. You're right, friend, I forgot. What else can we do? I don't like what we are doing. We kept on hiding. We are earning much but we are like rats. I don't like this anymore. Friend, what else can we do, but to accept our status right now? This is the reality that we have. So, if I were you, if you found someone and he asks for marriage, accept it. Besides, you are single. As for me, I can't. I am married in our country. Let's go, it's very cold outside. Hello, what's your name? Hello, sir, my name is Faye. If you can. Please, the loo, it needs a proper clean please. The loo? Yes, sir. Loose? I wonder where I can find that loose? Loose? There's no one in here. What is it? Hey, Faye. - Good afternoon, Ms. Nedy. - Do you have a problem? I apologize to have disturbed you. The manager is asking something I don't understand. He is pointing at it, but I don't understand. He is talking about a loose? Loose? Yes, loose. - Wait, I'll just call the manager. - Okay. Hello, Mr. Dugan. It's Nedy. Yes. One of my chambermaid is here. She said you're asking her something about a loose? Yes. Oh, right. Okay. Oh, that's okay. Alright. Okay, thank you. Bye-bye! Toilet. Loo, meaning you have to clean the toilet. - Oh! So, that's what he's talking about. - Sometimes we call the toilet as the loo. But the loo is the toilet. He says you have to clean it. Alright. I'll also tell Margo that the loo is the toilet. - That's right. - So, she will also know. Because someone might also tell her that and she wouldn't know it as well. - So, it's not loose? - No, it's loo. - Okay. I'll go ahead, Miss Nedy. - Sure, okay. - Are you okay now? Go on. - Okay, bye-bye. We can go here, or there? Hello, can I help you? - Friend, you talk to her. - Oh, you are Filipinos? Yes, we are just new here. So, we don't know where we are going yet. Where are you going, young ladies? No, I'm no longer a maiden, I am married and have two kids. Faye here is a not yet married. I will introduce someone to you. - Hey! - He is my niece, he is nice. Really? Let me meet him. If you want, we can meet at High Park. - Sure. - Is 6:00 PM okay with you? Yes, our work ends at 5:30 PM. Okay, then, see you later. I will introduce you to my nephew. He is really kind. - Okay. Alright! - He will be a great catch for you. Okay, we will come. Oh, come here. Listen to me, I have a friend who is looking for a cleaner. For past 50 per hours, so that's eight hours for 36 pounds. The salary is greater there. And aside from that, they are accepting those without papers. And you'll be working inside the house so it's safer. But they only need one. So, you two should decide who will be working there. It's okay, Miss Nedy, thank you very much. Friend, you go first because your family is bigger than mine. If ever there will be an opening again, let me get in, okay? Yes, of course. Thank you, friend, thank you so much. Miss Nedy, thank you. It's okay. Don't mention it. I apologize, Nido didn't make it to the High Park. You know, that man, always busy. Working and working. But he will be arriving soon. So, we can also eat. You might be hungry already. It's okay. No worries. There is Nido. Nido, this is Margo and Faye. - My nephew. - Hello, Nido. You know what? My nephew is very hardworking. He can help you work part time. Do you have a national insurance? Yes, we do. Nido, it's good, isn't it? Help them look for a part time job. Talk to your manager. I'm doing good with my job, don't bother. I don't have enough time anymore. But Faye, she is interested. That's it then. Help Faye instead. Nido, can you talk to your manager so you can accompany her tomorrow? Alright. - Okay then, let's eat. - Alright. - Rice you like? - Alright, you go ahead. Thank you. Don't be shy here, just eat, feel at home. Just go on. Sometimes I'll bring you to some Filipino parties here. So, you can meet lots of Filipinos here. Thank you. See that? Faye is not yet married. She also has legal papers. So, if you will be together, don't let her go. Marry her at once. Aunt, we are not so sure if they really have legal papers. But she is beautiful, I agree. - She looks nice as well. - Fix yourself then. It is important for you to have legal documents. So, move a little faster. You might loose her. Hello? Hello? Mom? How are you? How's Dad? - The kids? - Margo! How are you? Don't worry. The kids are doing great. We are taking care of them properly. But your dad is getting weaker and weaker. It seems that his condition is getting worse. Mom, don't worry, I will send you money. So, we can buy the right medicine for Dad. I'm close to getting a better job. Mom, is Tintin and Buboy still awake? Can I talk to them? Yes, of course, hold on. Talk to them now. Come here, kids, talk to your mom. Hello, Mama? Buboy? Buboy, how are you? Are you looking after your sister? I love you all so much. Don't worry, my child, the shirts and toys you asked, I will be sending them soon. Here's Tintin. Tin? Tin, my dear! Are you studying hard? Tintin, this is Mommy. My child, always eat well, okay? So you won't get sick. I love you so much. I miss you so much. Hello? Hello? Hello, Mom. I have to go. Tintin doesn't like to talk to me. Just take care of yourselves. Okay, okay, Margo. Take care. I love you. Ben, I want to apologize if I wrote this just now. I'm doing a lot of things here, I barely have some time to rest. Don't worry, we will get through this. I am saving for our future. And of course, for your bail so you can temporarily be released. We will have money to pay the lawyer incase we file for counter-affidavit. I am hoping that someday, our family will be whole again. Just trust me, Ben, and don't lose faith in me. I love you. And you're still the one I choose to be with. I miss you so much and our kids. Margo. I already talk to my friend—Juliet. I gave her your number. She will call you to accompany you to your new workplace. Don't let me down, okay? Just be good there. Miss Nedy, don't worry, I will do good. Promise, I will do my job properly. Thank you very much. Just be good there. It'll all be fine. Yes. Anyway, Miss Nedy. I will be applying for a new job. After my schedule here, it's an office cleaning job. Just two hours, and... Can I use the national insurance you lent us and the name as well? Possibly, because the owner is no longer here. She went outside the UK. And if your employer will be good to you, it will be okay. But you have to be careful, okay? - Alright. - Okay. - Thank you. - Sure, okay. Are you Juliet? I'm Margo. Alright, just be here early tomorrow. Congratulations. Take care. That's it. I am hired. - Wow, you are really good. - Thank you. - I told you. - Friend, thank you. Wow, you're so hardworking. I brought you food. - Come on, eat. - Okay, thank you. Friend, what are we going to do? Our Visa has already expired. What else can we do, but to be extra careful. How about you? Isn't Nido your boyfriend already? Why don't you tell him your status? He might be able to help you. Friend, if he helps me, it means we will get married. I'm not yet ready. Well, only you will be able to tell. It's up to you. Anyway, there will be a party on Saturday. To Alma's place, where I am working. Come, join me. Party on Saturday? Okay. I'll come. Why did you hesitate? I don't have work on that day anyway. I'll go sleep. Hello! I thought both of you will never stop talking. Yes, thanks to that. Anyway, I would like to introduce you to Faye and Margo. They work with me in the hotel. - Good evening. - Hi. Hi, it's nice meeting you both. Good evening. I hope Miss Nedy here is looking out for you in the hotel. Yes, yes, very much, thank you. You seem happy there. Anyway, here's my friend Michael. He's a talkative one. - Hi, how are you? - Hello. - We're okay. - What do you do? Work in the hotel? - Yes. - Do you enjoy it? - Yes. Yes. - Where are you from? - Philippines. - Philippines? I love the Philippines. I've been there so many times. I've heard a lot of nice things about it. It's a good place to relax, and have fun. Friend, I think you and Michael can be together. Aside from him being British, he has a house here and he is single. Could be, but he is really old. Never mind. - Hi! - Hello! You know what, my friend was raided and caught yesterday. The immigration came. Really? Why was it raided? You know, jealousy. If no one will tell, the immigration won't come. How unfortunate for your friend. Right. She is supporting and helping her family in the Philippines. Me, I was able to get a husband here, though I'm old. At least, I can go home. I can help my three children. It's really hard to hide, you always get nervous. We should double our care, or else eveything will be put into nothing. We will go back to being hungry. How about our family? Besides, I don't want to go back to the market. I'm good here. I will tell Nido that I don't have legal documents, and ask him to marry me. But we will not live together. Do you think he'll do it? I can't say, friend. But if I were you, I'll give it a shot. If ever you tell him that you don't have legal documents, he might also catch me. Don't worry. Leave it to me. I'll tell him that we just met here. When I arrived, that's the time we met, right? Okay. It's up to you. We can do this. Love, you know that I really love you, right? When I first saw you, I already fell in love with you. Thank you for telling me that you don't have legal documents. But... I want you to know that I don't have legal documents as well. Is that why you courted me because you thought I have legal papers? Is that also the reason why your aunt was very nice to me? No, it's not like that. But at first, that is really one of the reasons. But believe me. Now, I love you so much. Okay, then. What now? I thought we are legal. As in you have legal papers. I thought I will be legal here, unfortunately we're both illegal. If ever, both of us will be deported back to our country. How unfortunate! What are we going to do now? Let's just do the same. Just work and work harder. So, we can save enough. So, if ever we get caught... - We will have money for our future. - That could work. I am always ready. Nido, you're always joking around. Just a moment, wait. - Is that clean? - Yes, of course. Hey, are you sure it's clean? - The one who ate that might be sick. - Taste it. It looks delicious. Delicious? - I told you so. - Here's another one. Go eat it. Close all doors, call all the cleaners. - Hurry, let's go! - What the—? Faster, here, here. - Where? - Faster. Straight, go straight. Run, faster! To the left, left! In here. You guys can come out now. They're no longer here. Are you okay? Thank you, sir. It's a good thing that you told us earlier. No worries, I let you hide there so they won't easily see you. Faye, I know that your papers are fake. Nido is just close to me. Because his father is a friend in the Philippines. Thank you. Does it always happen here? It depends, sometimes they do random checking. Friend, what are we going to do? Is it always going to be like this? We don't have peace of mind. We keep on hiding and hiding, we're like rats. In the Philippines, though we lack money, we didn't have to hide. What are we going to do now, friend? I don't know. If I were Faye, I will definitely marry Michael. He is not that old. Besides, she'll just have to wait for two years. She'll just wait for her residency, then she can get a divorce. The guy's crazy in love with her. He's always asking about your friend. Oh, Alma. It's not obvious that you're a gossiper. No, I'm not. But, yeah, I will tell her your advice. Friend, if I were you... Should I marry Michael so I can get legal papers? Friend, that is a decision for you to make. But if you think about it, there is a divorce, right? You can always do that, if things didn't work out. But, friend, I am already in love with Nido. But I don't have any choice because we are in the same situation. We are on the same condition. Oh, my. My bestfriend is already in love. Will that be a true wedding? Yes, we will get married, but if I am done fixing my papers we will get a divorce. We can be together after that. We can get married. It seems to be unclear to me. What if you have a baby? What if he gets you pregnant? Maybe... I will just be careful. Then the decision is on you. If ever you pushed through with the marriage, you can forget about me. You know, I can't take seeing you with someone else. You know that I love you so much. Nido! Nido. How are you? I'm still sad up until now. I still can't believe that Faye will be marrying a British, so that she could get a Visa. Don't you know what happened to Faye? Nido, she was deported. Her marriage didn't push through, because she was caught by the police. - Michael? - No, no, no. Faye! Don't worry, I'll be coming for you. Faye, don't worry. Faye! Is that so? Where is she now? She's back in the Philippines. I didn't know. So, Nido, I'll go ahead. I have to work. - Take care. - You too. Thank you, Margo. That's him, that's the man who stole my purse. Sir, did you take that lady's purse? I don't know what you are talking about. Did you take that lady's purse? No, I don't know what you are saying. I have to go. Sir, you need to stay until we clarify this. Why are you in such a hurry, sir? - I'm sorry but I really have to go. - Sir, we need to search you. Do you have any weapons or drugs on you? No. How long have you been in the UK? Three years. Do you have the legal right to remain in UK? Do you have any legal documentations you can show us? A passport? - My passport? - Can I see your passport, sir? Sorry, but I need to go. Sir, show me your passport. Your Visa is expired, therefore, you are illegally remaining the in UK. I'm arresting you on suspicion of staying illigally in the UK. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you do or say will be later reprimanded in court. - Sir, can you please take a seat? - Please, I need to go. Sir, can you take a seat please? - I need to go home please. - Sir, you're not going anywhere. Can you just take a seat and calm down, please? - Sir, would you take a seat please? - Excuse me! I'm sorry, my grandma, she got dementia. She always leaves her purse. - She forgot. - That's okay, ma'am. But we still need to arrest this man for illegal stay. - Please help me. - Sir, calm down. I need to go home first. You can't go home. - Sir. - Please, no. - Margo. - Sir, come with us. Margo, help me. Margo. Margo— No, wait. Margo, help me! Hello? Margo... Mom? Mom? Mom? Hello. Your father already left us. It's time for you to know the truth. I am from a poor family. I started working at a very young age in a resort. So, we can survive. One of our guests is Nigel. Because he was so drunk... he raped me. And he got me pregnant. I didn't want to tell anyone, even your dad. I wanted us to separate, so that I'll just go away. But he still discovered the secret, yet treated you as his own. Margo, your father loves you so much. I'm sorry, Margo. I'm sorry, my child. Alma, come here please. Yes, Mrs. Donaldson? Have a seat. Alma, what happened to Margo? I saw her crying this morning. Mrs. Donaldson, she told me her father died. Now, she doesn't know how she can go home because of her Visa status. She also told me that the father who died is not her real father. Her true father is a British man who raped her mother before. That's terrible. No wonder she does look like a Fil-Am, or something. What does she know about her dad? What she only knews is the name of his father, which is Nigel. Is there something wrong, darling? Actually, yes. What is it? It's about our new cleaner—Margo. I saw her crying this morning. Oh, why did she cry? I talked to Alma about it. She told me that... she just found out that her father who died recently is not actually her real dad. So, who's her real father then? She also said that her mom was raped by a British guy. And got pregnant years ago. So, does she know who he is? Both her father and her mom kept this a secret from her the whole time through. You know... The only thing she knows about him is that he's British and his name is Nigel. So, what do you think we should do? I pity her. I think we should help her. You see people can do something bad, and take advantage of her situation and get away with it. Oh, we can't have that. Let me talk to with her in the morning, and see what we can do to help her. If his father is actually a British citizen, then she shouldn't be at that situation at all. No, she shouldn't. Let me talk to her tommorrow, and see how far we can proceed with this. We're sorry to hear about your bad situation. Please, accept our condolences. Thank you, sir. Thank you, ma'am. I gather, your mother was a victim of rape. And the rapist was a British citizen, is that right? Yes, sir. But I'm not really sure. I only heard from my mother after my father passed away. Where are you from, originally? I'm from Manila, sir. Born and raised. But my parents, they're from Puerto Galera. What's your mother's name? Melissa, sir. Hi, sir, how are you? Are you staying good? Well, so far, so good. Can you arrange some sailing for us tomorrow? Certainly, sir. I can do that for you. Alright, but we're a bit tired, so we're gonna head to our rooms and take some rest. - Okay, sir. See you tomorrow. - Bye, thanks. Sir, excuse me, where should I put this? Put it inside their room. Sure. Sir, if you need anything, just give me a shout. Hey, can you send us two bottles please? Careful. Wait! - Give me a massage. - Sir, no. Sir, please don't sir, sir, sir! Please don't! What have you done? Forgive me. Melissa? That is for you. They gave this for settlement. Let's not bring this to the police. Don't worry, I won't let anyone know. I'll keep it a secret. How are you, Thomas? It's been a long time. It's been a while, yeah, I'm good. So, what is this so important meeting that can't wait? Well, it's very important as it goes, Nigel. Remember that incident that we had in the Philippines, many years ago, when we're having our antics? Well, something has actually come of that. That's a long time ago. We agreed that we would never discuss this again. I didn't forget it, Nigel. I have never said anything to anybody. But now, we have to. Because the woman got pregnant and you have a daughter. That's ridiculous! Don't be absurd! Where did you get this information? Your daughter's here... working illegally. - With no papers. - How can you be so sure? I'm not sure, that's why I've come. Why do you need me? And what's in it for you? Let's just have a drink and forget about it. Nigel, she's under my care and I'm representing your daughter. Oh, come on, do you know the implications to me and my family? That's why I'm here, we are friends. And I want this to go away. I can't do this, it'll be commiting to a crime. You have no choice, can't you see this? As your friend and her barrister, I advise you, strongly, to cooperate with me. And? If you don't, then I'll take it privately. And I'm sure you don't want to go to court. I've got something to ask you. Yes? And I want you to treat this strictly confidential. Of course, yeah. A rape crime committed 32 years ago in the Philippines. Can the victim still sue the perpetrator? Alright. Well let us have a look, okay? According to the Revised Penal Code, under Article 90, in a relation to Article 89, after the lapse of 20 years, from the time the crime was committed, the offended party can no longer sue. So, the answer is no. And how about here in the UK? Is there a statue of limitations? Can the victim still sue? Okay. According here... Okay, let's check. Here it is. Under section 15-A, of Rule of 110 of the revised rules of criminal procedure, the criminal action shall be instituted in the court of the municipality... or territory where the offense was committed or where it's essential ingresses occurred. Meaning, no. Because of territorial jurisdiction. - And— - UK lacks jurisdiction over crime. If the victim got pregnant, can the child get an inheritance? Well, the law in the UK no longer makes any distinction, between legitimate and illegitimate children for inheritance purposes. And the answer is yes. But, if the father executed a will before he dies, then inheritance will be based on the will. If you excluded the child from the will, then... the child cannot inherit anything, unless he or she has a valid ground to contest the will. Can the child inherit a title? Well, as I said... Legitimate children have equal rights. And so, yes, but can be always disputed under act of settlement under European Court of human rights. Hi, Thomas. I agreed to do the test. Please sit down. This folder has a DNA result that you have been waiting for. This proves that Lord Nigel is your father. This is for you. Very glad we can help you. - Are you happy? - Yes, sir. Thanks. Margo, what happened? How's the result? It's positive. Nigel is my father. Wow, Margo, you're so lucky. Your father is a Lord, so now, you are Lady Margo. Wow! You are now Lady Margo. Don't forget me and Alma, okay? You're both so funny. I don't even know what to say when we meet. It is very simple. When you see your dad, you tell him... ''Dad, I'm very happy to see you.'' Then hug him, that's it. I hope it would be that easy. Hi, have you been here long? No, we've only been here a few minutes or so. Here's the report that I said I'll let you have. Margo, this is your father— Lord Nigel. Nigel, this is your daughter—Margo. Hi, Margo, I'm very pleased to meet you. I'm truly sorry for what happened to your mother. I was young, stupid, and drunk. I'm very sorry. If there's anything you need, just give me a call. Here's the deal. I will file her application for British citizenship. And the DNA sample that we took from you will go to prove that she is your daughter. I have no objection on that. But please, can you do it quietly? I don't want the media to get a hold of this. There will be a scandal. I hope you understand. Of course. Margo, like I said, if you need money, do not hesitate to ask me. So, where do you live? In Walthamstow, I'm renting a room. And where's your family? In the Philippines. Are you married? Do you have children? I have two children. One boy and one girl. How old are they? Buboy is ten years old and Tintin is eight years old. They are grown up. So, they must be very sad that you're here. Where is their father? Or how is he? Their father is in jail. He killed the man that took away our money. He's a con man. That's very sad. So, who's looking after your children? My mother. So, please tell your mother, I'm truly sorry for what happened. And I would like to meet her in person one day, and apologize to her personally. And I have something here for you. Just take this in your pocket and... Take it. I advise you, take this. Thank you. Thank you, sir. Don't mention it. - Thank you. - No, thank you. What is this, Nigel? Is it true? Let me explain, Charlotte. It happened long before I met you. - So, it's true then? - Yes, it's true. This is not happening. - Not now. - Let me take care of it, okay? You better be. Our friends, relatives keep on calling. And our phone never stops from ringing. You better sort this out. Dad, what is the deal about this child of yours? Who is she? Where is she from? Yeah, Dad, how come you never said anything about her before? Jennifer, David, it happened a long, long time ago. I just found out a few days ago that I had a daughter. Listen, I'm sorry, but I'm tired. And I just want to be left alone now. It's been a long day. We'll talk about this tomorrow. Thank you, Thomas, you're a good friend. Please tell Margo, ''Thanks,'' as well. I won't be able to see her for awhile to keep her away from the press. Also, could you get her to send me an email? I need her details about her family for my own personal record. Thanks again. Margo, please sit down. I have a good news for you. I received the letter from the home office. Your application from British citizenship is successful. Congratulations! Thank you so much, ma'am. Thank you. You can now travel in and out of the country whenever you like. You can work anywhere you want. And when you're settled, you can bring your family here. - Are you happy with that? - Thank you so much, ma'am. Thank you very much for all your help. Don't mention it. It's fine. - Thank you. - Are you happy with that? - Yes, so much. - Ma'am Liz? Phone call from Lord Nigel's office. I shall now start reading Nigel's last will and testament.
