I, Kate, take thee David to be my wedded husband, to have and to hold from this day forward, for better, for worse, for rich or for poor, in sickness and in health, to love and to cherish 'til death do us part. I, David, take you Kate to be my wife, to have and to hold from this day forward, for better, for worse, for rich or for poor, in sickness, in health to love and to cherish 'til death do us part according to God's holy ordinance and I pledge my faith and I pledge myself to you. I love you, Kate, I do. - Hey, I'm gonna go run and get us some ice, okay? Okay. Apparently this place has no ice. Jeez babe, it's freezing in here. Goodnight, love you babe. Love you too. Babe, your body is freezing. You are no longer allowed to touch the AC unit. Dave, can you get my phone? Hello? Hey beautiful, it's your husband. I still love saying that. Hey look, when I got up you weren't there so I just ran out to the store to grab some things. You want anything? Like something to drink or maybe some whipped cream for later? Hello? Hello? Kate, are you there? - Dave, there's someone in our room. There's what? I can't hear you. - Dave, there's someone in our room. Yeah, I'll see you in a few. - Dave, no! Love you too. You have reached a number that has been disconnected or is no longer in service. - Kate? Where are you going? Thought you were up. Good morning, beautiful. - Morning. - How'd you sleep? - I slept fine. - Pretty active sleeper, you know that? I still can't believe you're my wife. - I know. It all went by so fast. - Yeah, I think I may need a little reminder of last night. - Oh yeah? - Oh yeah. Kate, what's wrong? - Nothing, I thought I saw a spider. - A spider? Well it's a good thing you married a big, strong man like me. Spiders are scared of all these muscles. You're such a dork. - But you love me. - I do. - You're so beautiful, Kate. I can't wait to start a family with you. - I hope I'll make a good mom. - You'll make a wonderful mother. - I love you. - I love you too. We need to get gas. You want anything? I think the crib should go here. No, it'll look so much better over by the window. I just feel like it's more feng shui. I read it in a Dad book, I don't know. Come on, babe, you're reading Dad books? Of course. Aw. Yeah, well, I mean-- That's so sweet. Little Derek's gonna be here soon. Derek? We're gonna name him after your grandpa? I mean it's kind of a silly name for a baby but. Babe, I'm so happy. Me too. I love you. - I love you too. I love you, Little Derek. Little Derek sounds wrong. Little Derek does sound totally... Come here. - I'm fine. - Honey. - I just need to take a bath. - Kate. I'm here when you need to talk. - Oh my God, David! Oh my God, David! - What's wrong? - David! - Morning, babe. - Hey. How was your run? - It was alright. Except my back is like killing me. I'll bet. What are you making us? - You know, a little sausage, eggs. - Smells good. - A bun in the oven. Still can't believe I'm gonna have my own little man. - Or girl. - Right. Sausage is gonna burn. Kate, Kate! - Oh my God, no. - Let's go to the bathroom. Oh my God. I know it doesn't feel like it but we're gonna get through this. - Get through this? I just lost my baby, David. How do we get through that? - Kate. - I'm not having this conversation tonight. - You're not the only one that lost a child, you know that? - David? I'm sorry. I should've given this to you sooner. I had it framed after our first ultrasound. - I'm so sorry, Kate. I'm sorry too. - What was that? I don't know. - David, what is it? - It's just a bird. I'm gonna see if I can go help it. - Is it okay? David, stop! David, wait! No. - I gotta take a shower. - Aw. David? - Can I borrow some sugar? Kate, what's out there? - David! - Whoa! - There's someone outside, David! - What do you mean someone is out there? - I saw someone in the shed. - Okay, I'll look. Kate, no one's out there. Probably just tired. - I know what I saw, David. David, I know what I saw. David, there's someone out there. - Kate, please. Let's just go to bed and we'll talk about it in the morning. - Oh my God! David. - Can I borrow some sugar? - It's fine, it's fine. Go away, stop messing with us! - Can I borrow some sugar? - Go away! Just go away, man! Quit fucking with us. That was him. - Just some punk teenager. - We should call the cops, David. We should call the cops. Let's go to bed. Why is he here? - It's just some punk kid trying to mess with us. He's gone, let's go to bed, I'm exhausted. Come on, it's fine. I'm gonna go brush my teeth. I'll meet you in bed. - I keep thinking it was a bad dream. I just don't understand. I'm sorry. It's just that I wanted to be a mom so bad. I know I'm not the only one who lost our baby. I'm so sorry, David. - We're gonna be okay. Come here. I'm here for you. - Me too, babe. I love you. Can I borrow some sugar? - What does he want? David, maybe don't open it. No! David, I threw that away. Let's get inside. Let's go. - Can I borrow some sugar? - David, I'm calling the cops. - Now get the fuck out of here! - All I need is some sugar. Could you please? - Shit. - What? - I must've left my phone in the car. - It's fine, we'll just use mine. Did you use my phone? - No. Wait, what are you doing? - You stay here. What's taking so long? - Stay inside! What? - Just stay inside. - Hurry! What happened? What happened? What's wrong, what's wrong? What's the matter? Lock the doors, I'm going to check the breaker. - David? David? David? ¶ It's times like these ¶ - Kate? - David, David, David! - Kate, what are you doing outside? Get in here! Come inside, what are you doing? - No, no, there's someone in there. There's someone in there. - I was just in there, there's nobody in there. - No, no, there's another person, I saw him. Oh my God, David, we have to leave, we have to leave. There's someone else in there. There's two of them, I saw him. - Kate, I was just in there. - No, no, no, I saw him, I saw him, he's in there. - Hey, breathe, breathe, breathe! - There's someone else. - Come here, hey, hey, look at me, look at me, look at me, breathe, it's okay, alright? - We have to leave. We have to leave now, please. We have to leave. - Okay, okay, we'll go get the keys and we'll go. Alright, let's just go get the keys and go. It's okay. Can I borrow some sugar? Can I borrow some sugar? Gimme some sugar! - I'm going to hunt! A fact! I know you're there. - Shh, shh, shh, shh. Get in, get in! Just get in here. Just get in here. Shh. Everything is going to be okay. I'm gonna get our key, I'll be right back. Don't leave. - We're gonna get out of here. - David, wait, David, don't leave, don't leave. - Shh, shh. - Don't leave. David, wait, David. - Let's go. I got the key, let's go. - Come on. - Oh my God. Go, go, hurry! What's going on? - Fuck! - Oh my God, David. - Stay here, I'll go ask for help, stay here. Please, please help us. Somebody broke into our house. I think they're trying to kill us. Can you please call 911? Do you have a phone? - Are you okay? - We're fine, but can you please call 911? Somebody broke into our house, can you please call 911? - Can you tell me about it? - Look, somebody broke in and I think they're trying to kill us. Can you please just call the police? - I can do that. - Please, thank you. - I can do that. - Thank you. Oh God, thank you. Tonight's been crazy. You have no idea. Kate? Kate, look out! Run, Kate, run! Run! I need help, please, please. Help! Somebody! No! - No! - Help, help. Help me! Help, somebody! Help! No! Help me! Help! - Aw, are you ready, my dear? I brought you flowers.
