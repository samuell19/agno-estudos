Hey guys. Hey, Anderson, you know the rules. Last one in does the paperwork. That was me until you came in. If I'd have known that I'd have called in sick. You come late, you get leftovers. You come early, you get love handles. Hey! You better watch it, Anderson. That comes pretty close to libel here, you know. You mean slander. Libel's when they print it in the paper. Yeah, well I can still sue. Yeah, you'd have to prove she's lying. Is that what they teach you in night school, Cavanaugh? Hey it's law school, Mancuso, law school. Law school. That's right, and at least I'm trying to improve myself. Okay. So I see here in the paper that, uh... Oh, hey, hey, they're putting her case before the grand jury. Who's that? Oh, uh, that would be, the Garcia case, page 2 column four, "District Attorney Van Horn put forth new evidence..." Don't you forget anything? No. Cavanaugh, one week with my progressive memory techniques and I guarantee that you'll not forget anything. Hey, I got the tickets to the game tonight, Sonics and the Blazers, you wanna go? Okay, we can get dinner first. I don't think so. Hey. Hello, Kris. What, are you avoiding me? I don't feel like talking right now. Why not? You got a big mouth, Cavanaugh. Is that what this is about? I'm sorry. I didn't... I didn't mean to. What was I? Hmm? A big joke in the locker room? No, no, no, they... They guessed and I... You know, I had to... I had to try to put them off. Oh, you tried to put them off, so you told them that I like to dress up as a nun and tie you up with my rosary beads. Oh, that's very funny. Well, I had to say something. I'm sorry. I'm... Look, I'm sorry. It won't happen again. You bet it won't. Homicide. Hey, we got officers in pursuit of suspects from last Saturday's New Liberty Bank robbery. Ah, File number 00757483. Three gunmen killed a security guard, execution style. Eyewitness descriptions are as follows. You know the routine, people. By the book, no surprises, you work as a team. I don't want any dead heroes. Let's do it. Whoo! Oh, come on! Come on! Hurry! Okay, you go around that way. Okay, I'm on my way. Let's do it! All right, I want four teams, two in front, two in back. I want shooters on the roof up there and up there. You see something you sing out. No one fires without my say so. Foreman, you and Anderson follow the K-9. Mancuso and I are gonna take the waterfront. Hey, call the marine squad and get them to send some police folks. I want paramedics standing by. (Come on! TIN) Get back. Anderson, come in, it's Cavanaugh. What's... Anderson, come in. What's your 10-20? Drop your weapon! Hey. Anderson, what the hell were you doing? The book says stay with your partner. Yeah, well the book doesn't cover everything, okay? What are you talking about? What the ♪♪♪♪ is that supposed to mean? Oh, don't tell me. You had another vision. God damn it, Kris. Listen, you should have waited for back up. Leave it alone. She could have been killed, Abe. Get out of here! Don't sweat it, Kris. Hi. Hey. What happened to him? Lead poisoning. What happened to you? Oh, I'm having a bad hair day. Oh... Yeah, so I heard. Because of me there's a cop in the intensive care. Hey, Kris, the only stiffs in my fridge are bad guys. Go easy on yourself. Yeah, but you know, I can't keep jeopardizing my partners because I think I know more than they do, you know? Look, the way I see it, if it wasn't for you that guy's wife would be a widow right now. Yeah, maybe. Maybe you need to slow down. Have you been sleeping? That tape that you gave me, it's enough to put anyone under. What is that stuff? Works for me! So, you going with me tonight or are you in mourning? Oh, Barbara, you know, I... I don't know if I really wanna go. I'm not gonna know any of these people... Come on. Put on your best dress and let's go out tonight. Come on, it'll do you some good. Yeah, you're right. Okay. Um, I'll be ready at 8:00. Fine. Pick you up at 9:00. I'll see you later. Fine... Pick me up... Hey, Anderson. Hey, Anderson, are you alone in here? Will you get lost, Cavanaugh? See this? I've, uh... I've been chewing on it all day. I, uh... Oh, come on, give me a break. I'm getting a cramp here. Come on. Whoa! Now, listen to me. It's over between us. What we did was a mistake and it will never happen again. Now, I don't want you calling me. I don't want to see you outside of the station house. You know, you're a two-faced, story-telling pinhead and we are not romantically involved, you got that? Pinhead? Why did you have to tell everybody? I didn't. Look, I didn't tell. Besides, what do you think this place is? Fort Knox? Hi, come on in. It's okay. That reminds me actually. The Loot wants to see you in his office ASAP. Okay. Get out of here. There's a reason why we have procedures, detective. When lives are on the line the last thing we can afford is recklessness. Yes, I know, but I really... Just listen. Now, I don't know why it seemed like you were the only one that knew what was going on out there and I don't really care. But in the future, I want your leads to come through normal channels. Is that clear, Anderson? Yes, sir. You will be doing us no good if your instincts put you in the line of fire. You endangered your own life and the lives of your fellow officers. Fortunately, Officer Daggart is expected to make full recovery. But if you need a refresher course in standard operating procedure, I'd be happy to ship your butt back to the Academy for six months. That won't be necessary, sir. All right, that's what I wanted to hear. Now get the hell outta here. Anderson! Sir? I'm putting you in for a commendation. Oh, thank you, sir. Oh, these shoes are killing me. I can't remember the last time that I wore them. Well, you look fabulous. Really? And there are men everywhere. Oh, great. Just what I need, more men. Oh, loosen up for Christ's sake. I know what you need. Thanks. Drink up. Cheers. Cheers. Hello there. Hello yourself. I'll escort you to the gallery. Thank you. So what do I say to these people? "Hi, my name is Kris. I killed two people today." Well, it's the little things that make you special. Oh, look, it's the guest of honor. She certainly draws a crowd. Soon to be the honorable Senator if the polls are correct. It's terrible how money and power attract people. Unfortunately, I'm one of them. Barbara, darling. Hello. Gotta go. Hmm. Feel like you're being watched? I feel like I'm being hypnotized. Really? Mmm-hmm. Mmm, maybe you are. What do you think? Well, I don't know anything about art, okay? Mmm. But I know what I like. Mmm-hmm. And... This ain't it? Nope. I'm sorry. Kris Anderson. David Mander. Nice to meet you. Same to you. So, what do you do? I'm an artist. Well, this... This isn't one of yours, is it? Oh... No. No, I do very intimate art. Only one person would ever see it. Really? Yeah. What do you do? I'm a... I'm a cop. Oh. I'm sorry. Did that make you uncomfortable? No. No, I'm sorry. I just get... I do get uncomfortable around cops, even when I haven't done anything wrong I start feeling guilty. Oh. I'm the same way around beautiful women. What do you think that says about my character? I don't know. We could get together a little later, if you know what I mean. Excuse me. It's nice meeting you. You, too. Excuse me. Bye-bye. My, oh, my. Who is that? That was David Mander, the Senator's husband. Oh... Too bad all the good ones are taken. I know. Oh, it looks like another happy couple. I feel like I'm watching a soap opera. Oh... You know, Barbara, I'm really tired. It's... It's been a hell of a day. Do you mind if I go home? No, but I'm staying. Okay. Well, you have a good time. Thanks. Here. May I? Hmm, for you. A memory. Bye. I'll see you later. See you tomorrow. Have fun. So what'd you do last night? You just don't get it, do you? Yeah, I get it. You got what you wanted, now you're finished with me, and you get a commendation and I get the boot. I don't know, I... You know, I thought we had something. Yeah, well... Whatever it was I managed to get over it. Thankfully. Oh, so that's it. So we just pretend like it never happened, like you and me never happened? I think that that's best, don't you? Well... Well, I don't know, maybe I'm an idiot, but, what is it? Was it just me, or don't you ever wanna settle down and make a family and have somebody be there when you get home at night? You know, if I want that, I'll get a dog. I know you better than that, Kris. Yeah, I know where this is going, Cavanaugh, and you can just forget it, because I'm... I'm not interested in you. Hey, look it, how can I forget it? You're my partner, you're part of my life and you know, whenever I think about you, I think of you... naked and... Oh, ♪♪♪♪♪, do you wanna make me sick here or something? No. No. Don't be sick. Cavanaugh, what's up? Cavanaugh, you and Anderson get over to 1237, Anchor Street. Okay. We gotta go. We'll pick this up later. Uh... I don't think so. Hurry it up, Cavanaugh. Sure, I just gotta get your coffee, honey. Oh, hey, Anderson, check this out. Dispatch says this is the Janice Reynolds that's running for Senator. Name, please. Detective Anderson. Ooh, wait, wait. I'm getting a vision. It wasn't robbery. Okay, I'm finished over here. Yeah, I'm done. Cavanaugh... Stay behind the lines, all right? The husband's David Mander. He found the body. Mr. Mander, did you call 911? Mr. Mander? Oh, yeah. I did. You got some blood on your shirt there. What? Uh, it... It's hers. How's your head? Is it all right? Fine, thank you. Oh, I've cut myself worse than that shaving. Listen, you wanna... You wanna tell us what happened? Yeah, uh... I drove... I drove Sarah to school. What time? I got back uh, around 9:00, I guess, and um... Janice's car was still in the driveway. She was supposed to be at a breakfast fundraiser and I came in and I... I found... And he must've been hiding behind the door because he hit me before I could get a good look at him and we fought. I hit my head. I fell. When I woke up, that's when I, uh... I called the police. Is there anything missing from your house? I don't know, I haven't looked. Where's your housekeeper? Maria. Today uh... Today is her day off. Is Sarah your kid? Oh, I wish. Uh, her father was. Janice's first husband. You often drive her to school yourself? Yeah, every chance I get. Can anyone at the school verify that you were there? Uh, Jan... Uh, Sarah can. Anyone else? I better call my attorney, huh? That might not be such a bad idea. Please. Cavanaugh. This morning? Yeah, it's been busy. It's my third call today. Did you get the DA's office? Some place, huh? Mmm-hmm. You notice anything? What? The knives. It's a set, Anderson. It's a set of seven. Three are missing. What do you got? There's something in here. Over here. Hmm... I don't know. Maybe... You know, maybe... Maybe the jaw shouldn't be so square. This is crazy. I'd love to try and get a warrant on this. "Uh, yep. Yeah, Your Honor. My partner had this vision and..." - What? Well... - Cavanaugh? Yeah. If you're not too busy, you wanna bring me up to speed here? The security company never received the call. Mander claims there was an intruder in the house. There was no sign of forced entry. The witness only said there was somebody in the house. I can't keep the DA waiting all day. Yeah, if there's a camera rolling you can be sure Van Horn's on the case. Well, he's in the interrogation room now and I gotta give him something fast. If you've got a theory, I wanna hear it. I've got a theory. He did it. But he's got an alibi. The school confirmed that Mander was there. Hey, he could have been there in plenty of time to... No way! The M.E.'s preliminary report shows... Well, what do you care? I want this case, Lieutenant. Hey! Here, take a look at this. Gentlemen, this is Detective Anderson. She will be in charge of the investigation. Aaron Wingate for the defense. I'm very pleased to make your acquaintance, detective. I've heard of you, Mr. Wingate. I'll take that as a compliment. Mr. Mander, I'd like to remind you, you're under oath and that we are recording this on videotape. Oh, I... I have nothing to hide. For the record, my client reserves all of his rights. Mr. Mander, to the best of your knowledge, has your wife ever received any threats? No. Janice would've told me. What is the value of your wife's estate? I have no idea. Janice handled all that. It's about 40 million, I believe. What do you do for a living? I'm an artist. Do people buy this art? Money isn't the point, sir. In other words, you were one of your wife's worthy causes. You don't have to answer that. Your wife's 45. How old are you? 29. Describe your relationship. I didn't kill my wife. No problems at all? I did not kill my wife. Were you and your wife together last night? Yes, we had an argument at a gallery opening. Really? What about? I didn't like the company she was keeping. One last question, Mr. Mander. Have you decided how you're going to spend all that money? Everything goes to Sarah in trust. I get to live in the house and $75,000 a year for the rest of my life, unless I remarry. So unless there's anything else, I would like to go. Uh, the little girl's here. I guess, uh, nobody's told her. I don't believe it. You send men with guns to school. Lovely. May I go, gentlemen? Gentlemen... Lady... A real pleasure. Aaron Wingate. He's been busting my balls for 10 years now. Mander must really be worried if he can afford his fees. Hello, sweetie. Daddy, what's wrong? Nothing. Did Mommy say something to make you upset? Hi, you Sarah? Hi. Yep. I'm Kris. That's a cute doll. Um, you know, there may be an empty office if you'd like to... Great. Thank you. Okay. Come on, sweetie. Yeah. This way. Yeah, go ahead. Thank you. You're not eating. What's the matter? Uh, I'm not very hungry. You look like hell. Thank you. Is this case keeping you up at night? Well, it's uh... It's funny you should ask, but I... I had a dream about that. Well, actually, uh, about the prime suspect. Who, Mander? How was he? Oh, God. Well, I guess you do in your dreams what you won't let yourself do while you're awake. You know, I didn't know you were a psychiatrist. I thought you just cut up stiffs. The problem is, they're never stiff when they're breathing. Barbara. - How's your paperwork? - Peter, where's lunch? Blood on the jacket is hers. We also found some synthetic hair, like... a wig. There were matching traces on the body, too. What about prints? Clean, like someone meant it. Just let me... Let me just get something straight here. Are we ignoring this because it's obvious? The guy planted it to back up his ♪♪♪♪♪ story. Okay. Okay. So we still have to assume there's some connection between the killer and the victim, right? Yeah. The lady was running for office. She was rubbing noses with everybody in town. She have a little black book, Abie? Oh, yeah. I read it. What do you want to know? I hear she has a sister. She does, a well-known fashion designer. You got the address? Uh... 1449 Wilcox Avenue apartment 10-G. Okay, so Cavanaugh and I will start there. You guys do the background on Mander. I wanna know who and what he was before he became Mr. Janice Reynolds. Hey. Thank you. You seem kinda jumpy. What, are you picking up spooky pictures again? So... So when did this all start happening to you? It started when I was a kid, okay? Oh... Oh. I bet you figured out what your Christmas presents were before you opened them, huh? Yeah, well, it started as a nightmare and then when my parents died in the car wreck I realized it was more than a dream, okay? I'm sorry. Yeah, forget it, Cavanaugh. I'm... I'm sorry. I didn't mean to make fun of you, you know. You should just forget it. Hey, look, you know, no matter what I think, you're the one the lieutenant picked to head up this case. Yep. Well, I... You know, I just wanna say that I'm... Mmm-hmm. You know, I accept the fact that you're the boss. Yep. I'm the boss. I know you're the boss, I just said you're the boss. Mmm-hmm. So... So here. What's this? It's a peace offering. Just open it. You know, this is embarrassing. It's a beeper. Yeah. How romantic. Hi, could we speak to Ms. Reynolds, please? Ms. Reynolds. Nice place, huh? Mmm-hmm! You must be the police. Uh-huh. Do come in. Thank you. I'm Detective Anderson and this is Detective Cavanaugh. Aaron Wingate called and said I should expect you. Please, won't you sit down? Thank you. I can guess why you're here. Um, may I offer you some tea? Uh... No, thank you. Now, how may I help you? Um, we're trying to get information about your sister, Ms. Reynolds. I wish there were some insight I could give you, but the truth is we saw each other so rarely. We didn't get along. Oh... Well, um... What can you tell us about David Mander? I don't suspect him, if that's what you mean. David is a kind and gentle man. I don't believe he's capable of killing anybody. How did they get along? In public they were the perfect couple, but privately it was another matter. She was cheating on him. The only reason I knew was because David would bring Sarah over here. He didn't want her to see them bickering. Well, it happened so often, I finally gave him a key to the apartment. You understand, I think the world of David. I hope I haven't said anything that would get him into any kind of trouble. No. Um... I have a picture here I'd like you to take a look at. Do you recognize this man? No. I don't think so. It was nice to have met you both. I'm sorry I couldn't be of more help. Thank you. Um, if you think of anything, would you call me at the precinct? Of course. Great. Thanks. Okay. Well, we'll let ourselves out. Fine. Thank you. Bye-bye, Ms. Reynolds. Goodbye. So what do you say now? Was he jealous enough to stab her to death? It still doesn't wash. Why would he do it now? If she'd been cheating on him all this time, what made him snap last night? No, I still think there's a third person involved. Yeah, so Mander hired some guy to do his dirty work, he's still guilty. Yeah, maybe. Maybe not. Radio call, 4-Bravo-12. Anderson. Go ahead. Mander wants to see you and the Captain wants to see Cavanaugh right away. Got a problem there? No, no. I guess it doesn't look so good, huh? A man in mourning taking a dip. You wanted to see me, Mr. Mander. David, please. All right. David. Come on inside. Don't worry, it's safe. We keep the knives in the kitchen. Does Aaron Wingate know you're talking to me? No. There are a couple of things missing from the house. I didn't get a chance to look the place over till today. Janice had a gun in her bedroom. It's gone. A handgun? Yeah. Registered in her name? I believe. Anything else? Yeah. A couple of my shirts and a watch of mine and a ring, and a bottle of cologne. I'd just bought a new bottle. It was on my dresser. I think that's all. You know, there's something I haven't been able to quite figure out. What's that? Well, given what we know about your relationship with your wife, why didn't you just leave her? The first time that Janice cheated on me, I told her I wanted a divorce. She promised me that it would never happen again, and she lied. And then the second time and... Anyway, she told me that I would lose Sarah if I left her, which is true. And she also thought that a divorce would be bad publicity for her. So I kept my mouth shut and I played the happy husband. That was the deal we made. And I took her money. What does that make me? I'm not here to judge you, Mr. Mander. I'm just trying to do my job. Please do it, Miss Anderson. I have one more question. Were you cheating on her? No. Thank you. I won't take up any more of your time. Bye-bye. Janice used her appointment book as uh, sort of a scorecard. It's pretty obvious to see which, uh, entries were business and which weren't. She rated her lovers on a Richter scale. She seems to have cleaned up her act when she decided to run for uh... office. That was about six months ago. Well, the housekeeper saw them fighting plenty, but she never saw him hit her. She's quite loyal to this Mander guy. She'll probably give you an ulcer if you try to put her on the stand. What about a girlfriend? What was Mander doing with himself while his wife was playing around on him? Apparently, staying at home with the kid. There is no evidence that he was having an affair. I told you I want this guy's hide on a hook. You sound like you're not working with me here. I'm only looking for the truth. I don't give a damn about the truth. I care about the law. Well, that fact is, I can't find any motive for him to kill his wife. Hell, his attorney had more reason than he did. Which puts us right back where we started. Which isn't good enough. Look, we're always open to any suggestions you might have. I want this case wrapped up. And if you can't do it, I'll turn it over to the state investigator's office. God, do I hate that ass♪♪♪♪. You know, I wish I had something on him. December 19, Van Horn, Room 412, on the Richter scale, 2.6. Ah, yes! Hey, Anderson, what's going on? I checked our logs and 911. Nobody made any call. There was no call. Well, then what's going on? I had a vision. Well, then what's going on? I had a vision. She's dead. Oh,. Get back. What? What? What are you doing? What, are you out of your mind? You want to fill me in here? Oh, ♪♪♪♪♪♪. How is he? I gotta call this in. It's all clear. Hey, The Loot is gonna ask you how you knew. You better think of something. What? Ow! What do you got? Nothing. There's something in here. Got it. Ah! God. D.M. You are really starting to scare me. David Mander's prints are all over the knife. And the blood on the shirt is definitely hers. All right. Now we're talking. What else? Well, she had tissue under her fingernails, as if she scratched her attacker. And we found some of those same synthetic blonde hairs, just like with Janice Reynolds. A few on the shirt, too. I've heard enough. Let's pick this guy up. Uh, wait a minute. Don't you think this is all a bit too obvious? What's obvious is that we got there just after he killed her. I mean, there he is, he's standing there, he's soaked in blood. She's ripped the shirt off during the struggle. And then he hears the gunshots blowing in the doors downstairs and he just takes the shirt and he hides it in the one place he thinks we're not gonna look. But why? Why wouldn't he just take it with him? What's with you, lady? Can't you read the evidence? His prints were on the murder weapon. There's no motive. Why would he kill Caroline Reynolds? They were best friends. Uh, we just spoke to her lawyers. Caroline left 20 mil, not a penny in trust. Half goes to her niece and uh, guess where the other half goes. I've heard enough. Pick him up! Come on. You might as well admit it, Anderson, your visions are wrong about this guy. You know, something's jamming your signals. Yeah, we'll see about that, okay? Don't listen to him, Kris. You just keep following your instincts. They've never failed you before. Thanks. Let's go. Barbara, get me DNA on those tissue samples you found under her fingernails, okay? I'll try. Okay. Come on. I'm coming already! All right. David Mander. Sir? You're under arrest for the murder of Janice Reynolds Mander and Caroline Reynolds. Up against the car, please. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You are entitled to an attorney. If you cannot afford one, the State will provide one for you. Do you understand? It's okay, Sarah. Kris will take care of you, sweetie. Come with me. Hi, honey. You remember me? What's gonna happen to my dad? He's gonna be fine. They just need to talk to him for a little while. So, if you come with me, maybe we can get an ice cream cone, huh? How does that sound? Watch your head. Okay? You get in the back. That's such a good girl. Don't worry. You'll be fine. Will the court all rise? All right, Mr. Wingate. How does your client plead? Not guilty, Your Honor. Your Honor, may I ask why the press has been excluded from these proceedings? Well, the press is right outside the courtroom, Mr. Van Horn, and I'm sure there'll be plenty of time for you to get on camera. Now, can we discuss bail? Your Honor, in light of the charges, we ask the defendant be held without bail. Thank you. That's your cue, Mr. Wingate. Your Honor, my client has extensive ties to the community. He poses no flight risk. He also has a young child who depends upon him entirely. We ask that he be released on his own recognizance. Why, I hardly think that's appropriate. How does a million dollars sound to you? Excessive, Your Honor. All right. Bail is set at $750,000. I'll have you out in an hour. You really expect to find a match? DNA smears are rare. We better. Or David Mander is going away for a long time. Here we go. Here we go. "Robert Guy, also known as Robert Tower,." "Robert Parnell, Robert Eller Robert Reynolds." Registered sex offender. At least we know for sure it's him. Yeah, she's right. DNA don't lie. Gotta go. Hey, you know, the only reason why we're able to cross match this stuff is because in Florida they started taking DNA smears on violent sex offenders and death row prisoners, you know, just in case they had to prove culpability after the fact. I wonder why Caroline Reynolds didn't recognize her own brother. Well, maybe she was trying to protect him. Where the hell is he? You know. Well, wherever he is, he's a one-man crime wave. What about David Mander? Let him go. All right, I want this out in an hour tops. We gotta catch this bastard. Okay, well, what do we tell the press? The only thing you tell them is that Mander's out on bail, you got that? I don't want Reynolds knowing we're onto him. Got it. I'm not even gonna ask. Robert? You're kidding me. Janice went to great lengths to hide the fact that he even existed. Yeah, and we can't figure out what it is he's after. Here. Well, with Robert, anything is possible. Caroline said he was out of his mind. Well, maybe. Maybe he's just one smart son of a bitch. What do you mean? The name Robert Reynolds doesn't appear anywhere in Janice Reynolds' will. Of course not. She didn't want him to have anything. Well, exactly. But in this state, if you want to cut a blood relative out of your will, you have to exclude him by name. Now, she must have been so afraid that somebody would find out about this guy that accidentally she just cut him back in line. Yeah, but everything goes to Sarah. The last knife. Get the boys. Pick up the kid. I'll meet you at the house. All right. From now on, Sarah is under 24-hour surveillance. Kris has the night shift, Abe. You're relieved. Believe me I won't be relieved till I get home and take a nice, long crap. Hi. Look, Daddy, there's Kris. What? So it is. Stir that up for me, would you, honey? Hi, there. Hi. Everything okay? Yeah. Just want to get things back to normal... Sort of. Yeah, I guess you didn't spend a lot of time being woken up in the middle of the night dealing with bad dreams, huh? Well, it's better than thinking about myself. My chops are burning. Come on in. You sure? Yeah, come on in. Honey, look who's here. Okay. You remember Miss Anderson. It's Kris. Kris. Hi. Hi. And this is Maria. Hello. Hello. How are you? Good. Well, whatever's cooking smells delicious. Lamb chops. Sarah's favorite. Right, honey? Oh. And I'm making the dressing. And Sarah's making the dressing. May I? Mmm. It's very good. Thank you. So if you need me, I'll be outside. No, no, no. Somebody's got to, uh, chop the scallions. Oh, no, no. Really. I'm a disaster in the kitchen. Come on. Here you go. I never cook. That's okay. Righty or lefty? Uh, right... Righty. There you go. Start chopping. Here? Right there on the end. Very fine. Oh, God. You know, this feels like the first peaceful moment that I've had in... Well, in years. Really? Yeah, it's nice. Better go check up on Sarah. Excuse me. Okay. Buenas noches Maria. Ah, si. Buenas noches, senorita. I miss her. I want Mommy back. Just go to sleep, honey, okay? Sweet dreams, baby. Hello. It must be hard. Oh, you get used to it. No, you don't. Oh, um, Sarah asked me to give this to you. Oh. Sweet. What's the matter? Where did you get that music? This? A music store. It was playing, I liked it. Ow! What? My gun. Oh. What? He had... What? He had a gun. Who? I saw him shoot you. Me? It was just a dream. Oh. Oh, ♪♪♪♪. I forgot about Mancuso. There you go. Thank you. Goodbye. Cavanaugh. Hey. What are you doing here? There's been a schedule change and it's my shift. You look like you had a rough night. Yeah, well, I'll see you later. Very nice. Stretch up. Arms demi-bras. Nice. Lift with real tall stretch-ups. Arms to second. Hold. Arms down to bras-bas. Lift that weight a second. Very nice. Now, demi-plie and lift and demi-plie and lift. Nice. And bras-bas. A demi-bras. Sarah, think about what you're doing. Much better. Very good. And continue. Very good. Elbows up. Great. Chin. Chin. Very nice. Feet out. Good. Kind of reminds you when you were young, doesn't it? Up. Up. When I was young I ate chocolate donuts and watched Dobie Gillis. Oh. Up. Now, let's practice the positions we tried earlier this morning. Hey, Anderson, you in there? Oh, will you get lost, Cavanaugh? What are you doing in here? Look, uh, no matter how much you want to avoid me, we still got a job to do. Yeah. Do I need this? Do I really need this? Okay, okay. Just listen. I've been thinking about this shirt. You know, the one you found in the fireplace. Yeah? So? Well, it was put there to frame Mander. That's the whole point of it, right? So, I've been asking myself, why would he do that? Why would he put it there, since there's no way the police were ever gonna find it? Unless... Unless they have someone like me. Right? I'm being used, aren't I? But I... I'm sorry, Officer, we can't allow you to go in there. The girls are dressing. Is there another way out of there? No. No, she'll be fine. I'll watch her. Okay. Hello? Hi. It's me. I was still thinking about last night. I thought you were coming over. David, I can't. This is a major conflict for me. What we did last night. Well, I'm supposed to be protecting you. What are you saying, Kris? You don't want to see me anymore? No. What I'm saying is, we can't be together now. Maybe after, when all this is over. Do you understand? Yeah. Of course. Is there anything else? Is there something wrong? No. I just have to take care of something. Hey. Hey. Okay, so, where's the fire? What do you mean? Well, on the phone, you sounded like it was some big emergency. Yeah. I... I needed to speak to you. Can I get a coffee? Oh. Sure. I thought you were out watching over lover boy. You know, Reynolds knows about me. He's been setting me up all along. What do you mean? David's cologne. It was on everything. The bodies. His shirt. That's why I picked him up everywhere I looked. You know, it's a bit like giving a false scent to a bloodhound. And I realized, to make his plan work, he'd have to have me meet David Mander in the flesh. Wouldn't he? And he'd have to know about the other side of me. The emotional side, my visions. That music you gave me was the strongest connection, wasn't it? How could you? It was an awful lot of money. Kris! - Thanks again, Patricia. - Thanks, Patricia. We'll see you next week. There she is. Hi, Sarah. Hi. Hi. Your daddy wanted me to come and get you. He's waiting for you at home. Okay. That's all right, ma'am. I'll take it from here. My, uh... My partner's just out on another call. Well, all right. Okay. Great. Come on. Good night, Sarah. Good night, Officer. Good night. That was great! Mr. Mander, can you come with me, please? Sure. I want to ask you a few questions. Who's his back-up? You have a lot of explaining to do. She was working with Reynolds. Can you prove that? Not yet. You're in a world of trouble, Detective. Abe is dead. What? A patrol found him in his car over by the Dunhill School. The little girl's missing. You disobeyed orders. You obstructed justice. Look at me, ♪♪♪damn it. Look at me! Your law enforcement career is over, little lady. You're gonna be paying for this screw-up the rest of your worthless life. That's enough. If you have anything else to say to my people, talk to me. I'll say it to your captain. That is your right, sir. But this is my jurisdiction, and while you're here, you don't ♪♪♪♪ until I say squat. Now, I want to talk to my detective alone. Sorry. Yeah. Call off the surveillance on Mander's house. I want those cops on the street looking for Reynolds. Okay. You really screwed this up. Everything we have on Reynolds came through you. Now any lawyer worth his retainer can blow holes in his case like that. I want you to go home. You are suspended pending an internal affairs investigation. You are to have no further contact with David Mander as long as you remain a police officer. Don't even speak to him. Am I understood? Yes, sir. Now give me your weapon and your shield. Come on. What are you doing here? Well, uh, I called. And I tried to call and the... I unplugged the phone. I didn't want to speak to anybody. Uh, look, I'm going over to Barbara's to see if there's anything there that might help us, like... You know, I mean, I don't even know why I care anymore. I mean, Reynolds is probably halfway to Mexico by now. But, hey... Do you really believe that? I don't know what to believe anymore. I just... feel so useless sitting here, not doing anything, I... You've never been useless. Tom... Just, uh, don't tell me what you're gonna do. Okay. Well, I better get out of here. Guess who, Magoo. How ya doin', Sarah? Good. Good. Come on, let's go upstairs. We have to be kinda quiet. Okay? Open up. Open up. Creak. Very good. Are we trying to scare someone? Shh... Okay. Come on. Let's be really sneaky. Shh! You're right. Daddy! Oh. How's my girl? Good. Good. Sweetie, I need you to have supper up here tonight, okay? Can I eat with Maria? Maria had to go. So you eat up here. Be a good girl. Have a bath. And after that I'll come up and you can read to me, okay? Okay. That's better. We'll see you in a little bit. Bye, sweetie. You're late, Robert. I know, David. Traffic was really, really bad and it wasn't as easy as you said it was gonna be. I had to go through a damn cop to get her out of the that school. There's cops all over the place, in case you didn't notice. What's going on, David? Nothing we can't handle. Call Barbara, okay? Leave a message. Say, "Done. Taking the girl to the cabin." "Done. Taking the girl to the cabin." Cavanaugh! Listen to this. Done. Taking the girl to the cabin. All right, all right, help me out here. You remember that property list we got from Mander? 19945, Lakeside Drive, parcel A7411. You're a genius, man. Subdivided 1922. What are you doing? You had to kill the cop, didn't you, Robert? Well, I didn't think you'd mind, David. Here you go. Take that. Take the gun. Put your hands on it. Okay. I had to kill the housekeeper too. Janice was right. You are a psychotic little child molester, aren't you? Don't say that. What are you gonna do about it, Robert, huh? I don't think you'll do anything. You're too chicken ♪♪♪♪ to do anything, aren't you, you ♪♪♪♪ idiot? David? That's great. Thank you. Those are blanks. Why'd you do that, David? Did you think I would have given you real bullets, Robert? No. That's silly. Now these, on the other hand... Cavanaugh, I'm on my way to Mander's house. I think he's been shot. David, what happened? He hit me with the gun. We fought and it went off. He hid Sarah upstairs. She's okay, thank God. He put her in the bedroom and he came looking for me. He was going to kill me, Kris. What? What? I... I have to call this in. I did already. They'll know. So... So, I'll go get Sarah and... It's locked. He's got the key. Okay. Got it. Be careful. (EAKING) Sarah. Sarah, let's go. It's Kris. Come on. Huh? Myra. Come on. Oh. Now, I need you to be a very quiet little girl and stay where I put you, okay? No. No. Okay. Okay. Now, don't come out no matter you hear. All right? Okay. Be very quiet. Okay. Good girl. In you go. Bye-bye. Bye. Shh... That was silly. That was silly. Do you remember when we met, Kris? You remember when we first met? Well, I thought you were so sweet, Kris. So beautiful and so sweet. See, I've grown very fond of you, Kris. I'll miss you. Do you know that that power of yours is absolutely extraordinary? Tell me, did you get a vision of what's happening right now? No. But I saw you getting shot. Yeah, I remember that. That's why I had Robert shoot me with blanks, of course. I thought that that was very clever. All I have to do now, is make it look like Robert killed you and Sarah and then tried to kill me. But I guess that you would know all that already. But there's something that I'll bet that you don't know that I'd like to show you right now. Wait right here. I owe you a lot, Kris. I want to share this with you. Take a look. Look at this. You're gonna like this. Hmm? You remember this, don't you? It's beautiful, isn't it? Watch this. Huh? You don't remember this part. Watch. Watch. Surprise. Huh? I can't thank you enough for taking care of Barbara for me. She was very, very greedy and very possessive. You like Sarah? I'm very fond of her. I'm gonna go get her now. Where's the key? Read my mind. Sarah? Honey? It's Daddy. It's safe. Open up. Okay? Sweetie? Open the ♪♪♪damn door, Sarah! Honey? Sarah, darling. Honey? Sarah? Sweetie? Sarah? Where's Sarah? I seem to be the only one enjoying this. Wrong, ♪♪♪hole. Cavanaugh, you okay? Huh? Yeah? I don't know. Here. Get this off of me. Sarah. Okay. We have to go now. There's a good girl. There's a good girl. Everything's going to be okay, Sarah. You guys all right? Here you go. Go with George. There you go. Go with him, honey. Okay. All right. Pete, get inside. Watch your step.
