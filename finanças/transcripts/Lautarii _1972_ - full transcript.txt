MOLDOVA FILM THE FIDDLERS TOMA! TOMA! Toma! Toma! Toma! Toma! Cursed shrew! Sly fox! Tomorrow they will sell the gypsies. The bailiff read... the list. The list is long, I saw it with my own eyes. We are all registered there. They won't sell you. Well why? Won't you give them permission? Let's get out of here, both of us! When? You know, Leanca, if necessary, I'll even kill a man for you! You? Yes, me. Leanco! Leanco.. Leanco...What's the matter with you? Nothing... Leave me.. Look how good it looks... I don't want your bite to dissapear.. You have wolf teeth. What am I, an icon ? You always kiss me! Icon? Does it hurt you? No. Now you too will have my mark, until you die. Toma! What did you do with my dream? Why did you ruin my dream, bro? You see such a dream once every ten years! Come here, cur. Give me the whip. That's because you interrupted my dream. Kiss. What did you do, bro? Damn you! Untie the crap, he is choking! Brothers! What is it? What , what, what! Motherfuckers! Come on, Sile! Look at them! They are chasing us..., brothers. The candle! Give me a candle, dammit! Toma Alistar's band. Toma Alistar, who owes the state 30 golden coins for this year and 30 golden coins for the next year. Our superior is right, this is not so much. If we had... In Hotin, did you sing at the fair? On food and drink, daddy... That's it? That's it. Did you sing at Mihaileni at the funeral? For some food and feed for this hack. Your mother's food, you rogues! And did you sing at Muscalu's tavern? On bruises and bumps! They used the knives! The pockets inside out! Take off the belts ! Those rags, too, quickly! So.. Good people...near the deceased.. It's a great sin.. Stir! Take the dead man's violin with you! We take out about three parties on it. You are right, yes, sir! Toma Alistar worked wonders with this violin. He was driving the world crazy with it. ...forgive us our sins as we forgive.. Don't hesitate! Who steals from the dead, Stir, boy, at night dreams phantoms and gets wet! Your mother's cross! That's how you mock me! You laugh, damned you! Leave him! Why do you hit him? Stop it! Why are you staring? Take off your shirt if not, I'll take off your soul! It's over with Toma Alistar's gang! It is finished! Listen, Dragomir, spread out like partridges! If I'll catch you again with the unpaid taxes.. your bones will rot in the dungeons of the gendarmerie! This is what I'm telling you, Lieutenant Ermurati! Long live Lieutenant Ermurati! To Calarasi! Holy shit, don't get in my way again! I wish I'll see you crucified! I can not do this anymore! You will be able to, Dinga. Fuck the violin! I'm running away and you won't catch me! Where to, Dinga? That's our destiny. You are a man with a stamp on your forehead, Dinga. We are all sealed like cattle, with red iron! And this is worse than any curse. Look! Our dear money! Look at them, whole and unharmed! Thank you, dad. Thank you! Sile! This is yours! Come on, Dinga, don't be such a jerk! Get used with it! Whoever got into this "dance", in this "dance" he will perish! I'm telling you. You are wrong, Alistar! You will mess it up to the end. As I collect the money, I broke up with you. I will buy some land, do you hear? At least a little piece of land will be mine! Do you think so? I think so! Hands! Look at your hands! They are not able to hold either the horns of the plow or the rifle! On our foreheads we have a divine mark. I have known this for a long time. Look at your hands. Look at them. Toma! Toma! Open the door, Tomita! Is that how you obey me? All right! Don't be afraid! I won't hit you.. Give it to me! I'm going to send him to the blacksmith, to make axes, knives and earrings.. The world will look for him and he will have money. Get dressed! In vain, brother Toma. It will be done his will. No matter what, it's written on his forehead, I see! The seal of fate, the zodiac! I don't see any sign. Good luck. His name is also Toma. Do you hear? Toma Alistar. By the way, like you. He will inherit your violin and overcome you. And he will raise above us. And he will sing wonderfully. I'm seeing it! Yes... Maybe you are the "God's horn", Iancu. But as a prophet, you are worthless. Let's go, Toma. That's pretty much the story. Go, don't be afraid! Come on, he doesn't bite anymore! This is no longer a wolf! Let him! You scare the child for nothing. Let him strengthen his character. To go through life like a sword! Wedding in this weather, Pane Velko? Well, his navel is freezing! The wedding is good in any weather, Iancule! How much do you pay us, Velko? A golden coin for everyone, Desko. Only one? What, isn't that enough? And how much do you give to Toma Alistar? Heh, heh, heh! Who are you messing with, you bastard? With Pan Alistar? However, how much? That's enough for you! Only to Pan Alistar we give five golden coins because he is "obermusikant" in all the mountains. Pane Velko, you can't put a price on music, women and mountains because you are committing a great sin! That's right, that's right! Not even Franz Joseph has enough money to buy music. Music is a lady too classy to pay! It's expensive! Don't torment me, go up, I'll pay as much as you want! Look, the little wolf! Slow down, kids. Who called you here? We came to see your wolf. But this one doesn't want to see you. Get out of here! Get out! What do you want from me? Give us the wolf! What? You don't want this one? Beee. Let me go! Leave me alone! Let me go! Why are you holding my feet? Let me go! I'll show you! Will you give us the wolf or not? Let me get out of here and you'll pay for this! If you don't give us the wolf, we'll take you out so everyone can laugh at you! A boy with braids... Okay, damn you, I'll give up! Go on, take your little wolf! Free him! I'll show you! Now you will see! Wait till I catch you! You'll see what I'm going to do to you! Toma! Toma! Sit down. All you do is play! Your father, Toma Alistar, is dead. Even Desko who was riding the bear died. And I was about to.. Stay with me. You will stay with me as long as you want. Snow fell on us. I was coming from the wedding, with buns in my bag... for you. Where to? Thank you. Come on Nice. Who is the leader of the band? I, Toma Alistar. Tell me the names of the others.. Iancu Baba. Everyone knows him by his nickname. "Trumpet of God". Have you heard of him? What a trumpeter, your highness! Ciupe."Blue Heart" Plays at the weddings and parties. If you need us.. Dardaila. How? Dardaila. Dardaila and how? Only Dardaila. But what did they call your father? I do not know. I didn't have one. He abandoned us when we were small. "Lepadatu" (The abandoned one), that's how we write. Lepadatu, yes, sir! The name? This is Costache Mutu (mute). He's mute for good, your Highness! Good luck to him. The tzar excepted him from the taxes! Exactly. You? Me? Yes, yes, you! baron von Kerkeli (Cherchelit=drunk) Siementhal... How? Sandu Calimara (Inkpot), from here in Capresti! "Votre Excellence"(Your Excellency)! I sang it all over Europe! and Europe was crying! Forgive him, your Highness.. Shut up! Danke schon, bite schon...(Thank you, please) Take care and remember what I tell you. The wandering fiddler cannot marry the daughter of a good man or a nobleman, Maybe... maybe.. because some like those are a mockery of God and people! and not even in the cemetery they won't be buried near the other people, but at the edges. And at confession they will be the last and also they will be the last when the sins will be absolved. We humbly bind ourselves to pay the taxes every year because the one that will refuse to pay it, will be consumed by the fire of Hell... People, people! People, people! The greatest wonder in the world! The young and cheerful violinist torment the bloody wolf! People, people! There was no greater miracle in the world! There is a fierce beast in the cage! Those who don't believe, put their finger in the wolf's mouth! People, people! There was no greater miracle in the world! The violinist Toma Alistar, has no fear of death! Citizens and fellow citizens! Come, children and adults! Farewell performance! Only once, here at your place! The farewell performance will start in just a few moments! Do not breathe loudly around the beast! Guard! Danger of death! Honey, do you think this is a wolf? This is a dirty bitch! Leave my top hat! Citizens and fellow citizens! Let's start! People! Take care! Bravo! That's right, boy! Nice! We conquered them. We have them in our pocket, boy! Please honor us. Beat it! Long live the violinists! Magnificent! Charming! Adorable! Come on, come on, come on! Come on! Brothers! This man doesn't look at the money when he pays! (is very generous) Here we eat and drink heartily! No gendarme has come here since the time of Alexander Macedon. At the mill of Negostin... Between Larga and Hotin Thieves come to drink wine mixed with rosemary! Thieves come to drink wine mixed with rosemary! They come on their runaway horses, virgin girls robbers. Between Larga and Hotin At the mill of Negostin... Smell of death! Gheorghe Negostin! Hey, Gheorghe Negostin! Such a feast! It smells like baking! Fresh bread! Yes! We have eaten heartily. Gheorghe! Gheorghe Negostin! So, you are lautari. Isn't it obvious? Yes! It can be seen from afar. Have you come to plunder the forest? It wouldn't be your forest! Mine? Mine, man? And whose band is this? Alistar's, Captain! Are you tricking me? Hey, my captain! You don't know us, do you? Are you in trouble with the law! What do we have with the law? It is for those who wrote it! But here in the den of wolves , only those with a shadow in their soul come. And who are you? You look amazing.. Radu Negostin, the death of the boyards, the sleeplessness of the gendarmes. Wow! Excuse me! Do you like me? We like you, daddy, are you still asking? Radu Negostin? Don't I look alike? Boy, you became grey! The salt got into my hair and skin! And where is Gheorghe? They took him in the salt mine in my place. I ran. I ran, uncle Toma, from the bottom of hell. And you, his brother, became a miller in his place. He, a hostage and you the miller. Yes...miller. But this mill grinds bones of boyads and gendarmes and red flour flows, Toma Alistar. Laugh brothers, they must not think we were scared. Why are you so yellow, from hunger or fear? The poor lautari were scared. The mill is this way, where did you go? We have ground wheat. There is fire, there is water, glory to God! Aye! Brothers, I say it's about time to clear off. Where are you going, fiddlers? Come in! Maybe there is a hole in the mill and we could clear off. The flour smells of plowed land. Of fields. I raise money. I will buy some land or maybe I'll become a miller. Only miller. You don't need money if you have pistols near your belly.. Brothers... I saw them. Radu, tomorrow morning at Vadul negru. And if they are cunning? Ten lives for one of ours. That's right. Tomorrow morning we'll go to meet Gheorghe. The authorithies ask for three people in exchange. The sin is mine. I'll go. Are you going, Hramine? I'm going, the two of us with Anafura. Lord, forgive your servants, Lord. In the name of the Father, of the Son of the Holy Spirit, amen. God's creatures! Don't be upset, my angels! It's like you've come down from heaven, only your wings are missing! Sing to me today all night and all day for as long as I have left to live! Sing to me until I'll get tired of it! You stole the chalice from a holy church! You plundered the house of God! Not at all! I borrowed this from Father Mihaila! What, we put the gun in his stomach? As he saw us, he gave it to us! Tell to the mute this thing! Our archimandrite speaks so well! Damn fiddler! I'm fine with God and with the devil, too! That's what we are, bishop! God's devils! I'll surreder tomorrow morning in exchange for my brother, Gheorghe. Why don't you eat? Eat. Who do you leave me to? Even I'll be crucified, I'll come down from the cross to you. Do you hear me? Radu, where are you from, ma? Green leaf, three lemons, Radu, where do you come from? I come from the fight, brother With the mallet attached to the back I did justice to all of the boyards. These guys go to death like to a wedding. Order the battle preparation. On order, captain. Company, listen to my order. Load the gun! Why did you stop? The bullets don't reach here! After me, fiddlers! Three to the head, three to the feet! I take them all by the armpits, I lifted them all up! I threw them from the shore! in the water of the Prut they drowned... Listen, Gheorghe, at the first suspicious movement, you will get a bullet in the nape! You understand? Brother Alistar! Buy candles and pray for the salvation of our souls! Play again! Basil, is that him? Yes, sir. Are you sure? You're not mistaken? Sure. Good. I would order fire and I'd finish all these robbers. We gave our word of honor. Honor... Honor is a very relative thing, Captain. I order you, drop the guns! Louder, fiddlers! Look, Gheorghe, pay attention! Beat it, "opinca" (the name of the peasant's shoe)! Brother! After all, I still run away! Take care of you, brother! Don't give up! Not even dead, brother! Brothers, do you know how long a human life lasts? You do not know. There it is! That much. Receive, Lord, and protect your servants Ramin, Anafora, Radu Negostin. Toma! No one is answering! 1,2,3... 1,2,3... So...some peasants.. Kiss your hand, boyar. Long live, sir. Do you like it? Very beautiful.. Of course we like it.. He sings so beautifully, sir Well, your time has gone. Now it's different music! There in Europe, in Paris, the greatest, the... true music is made! Boyar, take a better look here. You don't remember me, do you? Look at me! No, master, I see you for the first time. Boyar, when you were little, who played drums and whistles for you? When the great boyar sent you to study in France! Well, it wasn't you who asked him with tears in your eyes to let me go too, to be happier among strangers? Now I remember...like through a fog! Are you Toma Alistar? It's me, boyar! It's him! Papa cared about you! You've aged a bit... Yes...boyar! Our needs, like the spring rains.. I understand, I understand.. Lead the people to the kitchen, to eat something, to warm up... If the servants like it, all they have to do is sing to them. Are you satisfied? Long live us, boyar.. Kissing.. I came up with something else. Well, please, please, but faster. Boyars, poverty with luster. We don't even have any money left. Your father, the great boyar, gave me this white paper for dark days. The great boyar said that in the most difficult hour of my life I should come to him or to his descendants to exchange this paper for a hundred yellow coins That's what the great boyar said. May it be easy for the peasant. Let me see. Where did so much money come from? What am I, monser thief? The boyar left me a will, with the tongue of death. Let no one touch them, not even the descendants. I have never heard or read such a thing. The Cernea boyar could not lie! So I'm lying? I did not say such a thing. Naughties! Hagibek! Maybe not now! Maybe another time. Another time. Good. What are you doing, boyar? Are you breaking your father's oath? This is a damn thing! So that you can sleep peacefully at night and without false illusions! Do you hear, Monsieur? Leave! Get out of here! Go and dig the land! Go and graze the pigs! Go and cut the salt (in the salt mines)! Your time has passed and it will never return!! Toma! Toma the Antichrist! He stole Leanca, boyar! The light of our eyes! Saint Elijah would shake him with all the forks of the earth! Thomas the antichrist, the violinist... Stop! I don't understand anything! You pretend that I don't understand anything.. Sir! I can't hear anything! The thief stole it from me! Our ornament is gone! Decoration-undecoration, but she went willingly! He charmed her with his damn violin! Dry his hands! It drove her out of her mind! Okay, ma, and what do you want from me now? Shall I bring it to you? On our knees, we beg you, nobles, give us two horses...from the chosen ones. To bring the Antichrists back! May my eyes burst, boyar! We bring them, immediately we bring them! Give us horses, consul, so that we will remember you even after death! Give them horses, my Vascule, because they've all gone crazy and we'll go out of our minds with them! Ptiu, that's for defending you! Can you do it like an owl? Like an owl? Yes. Why are you spitting on me? Don't be touched by the bad destiny. That if he turns a blind eye to you, it's very sad. This time I will put a spell on you so that no black spirit will bind you. Red cup of love and luck Cup of passion and luck. Faithful spirits, listen to me He who comes with hate pretends to be scum Listen to me spirits, get up, get up, get up... fire and flames, for the enemies of Toma Alistar The stomach would broke and their tongues would dry out.. His eyes would glaze over, his bones would become mushy.. Cast a spell, Leanco, to fulfill our desire To arrive in the mountains to the house of Iancu Baba lautaru, dad's friend Cuckoo! I told you, freshmen! Well, and? We missed our cousin and fell right here.. Look, we found each other.. You didn't expect it! Neither us! That's right.. This is because God is big but the earth is small. What do you want from us? What do we want? Nothing. What do you need a gypsy? Get yourself a Moldovan girl! Come on! Tetjia, you will die of stupidity at the tent door. Let's go. Tetjia, I'll give you a silver penny, just tell them you lost track of us, all right? Do you have a silver penny? You don't believe me? Tetjia, leave him! I would see you on the nose dead, Your blood should flow from your nose and mouth.. The fire would burn piece by piece! Bade Toma, come on! They released the dogs and they will tear us apart! Come on! PART TWO Saints Peter and Michael opened a tavern in heaven Come on, come on, the wine is sweet, whoever drinks it never leaves. God it's bigger Sade is riding a barrel Come on, come on, the wine is sweet whoever drinks it never leaves. Even St. Paraschiva blows her snot, she's drunk, Come on, come on, the wine is sweet whoever drinks it never leaves. And the forty saints walked with a barrel in their teeth.. Come on, come on, the wine is sweet, whoever drinks it never leaves... Pul, pull!, don't mourn The will of the parents, the will of God. Begin, Vladica. How many? Twenty. Stop it. End it. You will remember this runaway for the rest of your life. World, world, sister world.. World, world, sister world.. The world is so, a passing thing.. One is born, another dies. World, world, sister world.. He who is born suffers he who dies rots, World, world, sister world.. Then I would get fed up when they will fix the nails on my coffin. World, world, sister world.. When they will put me in the grave and you will no longer be on earth'.. World, world, sister world.. When I hear this music, I want to quit everything. I no longer know who I am or where I am. Come on, Alistaras, play one song like this wild cherry jam. Sometimes sweet, then bitter, so the boyar enjoy it. Welcome, kir Andriadis. Old Costache sang for Pushkin the poet, in General Orlov's house. And for those boys who were called "Decemberists" (who had the courage to fight against the tsar). it was like fire! Why are His Majesty's hussars sad? Your hussars, better said aunt, than the Tsar's. Mine and the gracious emperor's. The hussars of his majesty, the Tyrant! Isn't it too bold? The monarch as well as the autocracy are in continuous perfection. The monarchy can therefore confer... The monarchy cannot give anything! It can only take away. Yes.. Have your lordships ever heard the beating of drums at the time of execution? "Catharsis", as my ancestors, the Hellenes, used to say. Catharsis. Words cost nothing. Drink, brother. Excellency! What? Excellency! Come on, say it! Let him see the world! And let the world see him! What's wrong with you, hussar? No, it's not a whim! Maybe it's the best thing you do in life. Well, I don't hold anyone by force! Kiss his hand! Kiss his hand, I say! Have a good trip, little Alistar! Alecsei, dear, good way! Hussars remain hussars, either in Vienna or in Budapest! Have a good trip! Hurry up! The weather is getting worse! Come on, black devil! Come on, Satan! Leanca! Toma! Leanca! Good morning. She is Annelisa, she is my daughter. You must become friends. Please.. Are these for me? What about the slippers? Where are my slippers? What, do you want me to walk with bare feet? Slippers, is your name "slippers"? Slippers, do you understand? The slippers! SLIPPERS! Understand? "Slippers" There are beautiful slippers in Vienna. The slippers! Helmuth, you scare me, what is this? You are wrong all the time. I'm tired of your anemic violin. One more time! Here you go! All right, practice! My good friend, Alexei Vaturin, our guest brought us a young musician from Bessarabia.. which, according to him, is able to amaze, even shake the world. Do you read the notes? He doesn't know German. Nothing. Take a seat. I hope to give you a pleasant surprise this evening. Come over! Come over! I present to you my good friend, Alexei Vaturin, our guest from Saint Petersburg. Ardent and impulsive nature. Please, Mr. "Slippers", please! Charles B?riot, Concerto no. 7 for violin and orchestra. Candles! There you are, dear lady! Gas lighting! The fruits of progress! Congratulations! Mr. Sekendorf will ask you to come closer. Admirably! Superb! Welcome, young man, pass, pass! Great, young man! Live... long! May you live too! Hello. The papers please. Thank you. Pleasant trip. You're home, pigeon. Welcome. Bassarabia.. Brother...take me with you I am not afraid of wars. I make wars. I am also a hussar. I am not afraid of death. Don't say! Know that I'm not afraid! Nonsense! You were born for greater things! Walk around the world, brother. Walk around the world and sing, brother! And sing for me too! Igor! Let's go! Toma, Toma has come! Look at Toma! Which Toma? Hello, uncle Preda! Too bad you weren't with me! What are you doing, devils? Look at the "mademoiselle"-s. Wait, are you mad? These are from far away. This is for you, uncle Preda! Hold on, Nuta. Take it to dad. Must I take it? This is for you, aunt Doichita. Oh, what a beautiful scarf! Where is Leanca? Give it back to him. Aunt Doichita, where is Leanca? Leanca where is it? Leanca! Leanca! Where is she? Leanca is married. To whom? To a serious man! Hungarian gypsy! Man with gold in his pocket and mind in his head! Why should we have given you such an precious girl? She didn't want to. She cried! Sit down, Toma. You have not been with us for a long time. Go. Go to your folks. Buy a plow and a horse and become a man. Gypsy and Modovan blood cannot mix. That's what God wants! Leave! Go to your folks. Good luck, Mr. Moses. I'm listening, father. I am very attentive ("only eyes and ears"). I will pray for God's mercy and heavenly help but in worldly affairs you are stronger, Mr. Levi Moses. Search everywhere! Send message until the end of the world! You have people who can ask even the dead! You can do what God himself cannot do, so they say. Find Leanca! Young man, God can do many things but does few ! Levi Moses can do few things, but he will try. That costs money. A lot of money. Mr Moses, I am a dead man without Leanca. Take this money. I'll give you all I have. And I will pay you until the end of my life, just find her for me. Good day, mr. Levi Moses! Sodom, Gomorrah and the 10 commandments! Master Toma Alistar! Hanka! Rachel! Solomon! Oh, my God! Levi Moses is sleeping. Pinch me! Levi Moses dreams! You thought I moved to heaven, angels! That Toma Alistar is finished, have you? You were dead and resurrected How many times until today? Well, why are you standing? Run to work! Run, run to work. Work ennobles man. Hanka, bring something to drink! And don't forget some olives. Go, go. Mr. Alistar, we are very pleased to see you. Thank you, ma'am. When the gendarmes brought you my violin, you thought I was dead, Levi. Oh, dear! The clients like you don't die without paying the debt! We know well who we are dealing with. Duty? Levi, I have no money again. At this time, nobody has money, except those who have. Violin! Well done, Moses. This is the expensive wire. From Vienna. I'm sorry. Very expensive. Levi... About Leanca... nothing? You don't want to resign yourself, Toma Alistar. 100 lives are not enough to find a grain of sand at the bottom of the sea. Have you thought this? Here, for 20 years, or even more, you and I have done everything, everything a mortal man can do. God does not want to help us. Maybe it will help us in the end? Thank you very much, "mamzelle" Hanka. "Mamzelle"(Mademoiselle=miss) Do you hear how sweet Toma is telling you? "Mamzelle" Soon I will invite you to sing at her wedding. Gladly. But will you come and sing at my wedding? If you would be so kind as to call me... Gladly.. From Saint Petersburg, from the Great knyaz... We sang at Krestovskij village The boyars around me were wailing and shouting: " Well done" The Great knyaz approached me. He tapped me on the shoulder and gave it to me... You pay the taxes for two years and you get your share. You give the rest to the spies, to look for Leanca... look for her. Do you hear that, Levi? That's enough? That's enough. Brother Toma.. with the money you spent on the search, you could have build three houses and you could have bought another stud of Arabian horses. If I die and don't find Leanca... you must know that I lived in vain, mr. Moses. Doesn't get upset... but didn't I send spies and letters to Sechesvar (Sighisoara) and Buda? I looked for her in the whole Hungarian plain and across Nistru to Krim and Krakow, in Poland. And to the Serbs, on the banks of the Danube, I spread a rumor. But you.. Until the hour of death I will look for her. Don't worry! If I will gain other money, I'll give them all to you. Only find Leanca, dead or alive. Track her down. The autumn of your life is coming, Alistar. It's time to reap the rewards. White money for dark days. Levi! Man lives for a bird. It is a great luck to see her. It is even greater luck to have it in the palm of your hand. I, Levi, had this bird right in the palm of my hand. and when I was about to catch it, right then... at that moment... they stole it from me. Life, life, tied with a thread... The thread broke. Life went to hell. What are you murmuring? Leave me alone! Master... yes? And me? Here you go? But I don't see the beard! I pay you! Shave me. As you want. And money is money, and money is in power. and without money you don't do anything.. Scary beasts. Look, the leeches... Money is money, and money is in power. and without money you don't do anything.. They feed on human blood, you gypsy.. Woe is me! Mr. Toma, are you ill? Maybe we put leeches! Solomon, I'm completely fed up with leeches! This is Surila, my joy. Surila, sing something for Badea Toma. Badea Toma can be hear how brave Soila is. Well, what do you say? Bravo. Well done, Soila. Well done! Don't forget for the rest of your life that Toma Alistar himself told you "Bravo, Soila! This one will live 10 times longer than us. Damn it! We want to leave until morning. At parties and drunkenness. God forbid. As dawn broke, we'll leave for Moghilau. Don't go drinking! Carry on. Toma! Here you go. The other one. This is the last money. Give them here! Get your paws. For 20 years in a row, Toma Alistar strained for your pleasure. You squeezed all the strenght out of him, vampires! You hide his money, you broke your father's oath. God, what I'm seeing! Take it! Give it to your lover, from me. Put back the drawer. Sit down. So talk, boyar. How are the French people doing in France? The French? Well, well... they're doing very well. Very good. Salamalekum.. Did you call me, sir? No... I mean yes. Master! What happened? Hands up! Up! Turn arround! Go near him. I'll go... Move! Faster! I'll send you to heaven, servant! So...don't you move..God forbid! if not, your brains will fly and the fire will consume you! I would strongly advise you not to move I am gentle as a lamb with honest people. Turn your eyes, if not I'm moving them for you! Leave them to God! Dragomir! Let's run, Dragomir! Damn you! Dragomir, run, Dragomir! Nobody moves! Back! Back! Do not approach! Water! Stop! Stop, for God's sake! Cheers, Mr. Moses! Good luck and peace, Manaila. Come on, come on, daddy's bitch! Master Toma, don't feel sorry for the watch, God gives and God takes away. Jupan Moses, when my sinners will appear, one kick in the ass for both of them! Tell them to reach me at the bridge of Movilau! You'll kick them in the ass.. because I can only have damage from this job. Farewell and respect, Mr. Moses. "Arivoar" demoiselle Busea. Why do you want to torture me? And alone? I feel compelled. I'm sick of this stuff. Of them, of you.. Come on, let it go! I'm squeezing your soul. I told you before. How do you think? If you say, I'll set you free. Come on, bleat like a lamb. Tell me! There were only two of us. The one who died and me. Du as you like even kill me, but this is the truth and I have told it to you before. Seraphim! Maybe you "unscrew" him ! You, the moldavians understand each other better. For a violinist there is nothing in the world more expensive than his hands. Not even his eyes. He see with his eyes. But he feels the string with the finger. Let it go, Seraphim! Aye, sir! From now on, boy, you definitely don't sing anymore. You can be sure of it! I say everything! Dragomir died. I am here. There was no one else. Only me. Only me and the one who is dead... Kill me, but I'm not guilty of anything! I am not guilty, on my cross no, I'm not guilty! There is not, there is not, there is not on this earth proud Jewish flower like the Moldavian hora! Green leaf of basil, dance more lively the "hora" Girls' basil, boys' love! Break the hora in the middle to enter the girl! Easy, easy, with the girl next to him! Good day, Toma Alistar. I'm Maria Manole, your cousin. You haven't forgotten me, Toma? From here on the Raducean magura. You went far away for a long time and you deviated from your people.. Long live, "coana" Maria. Uncle Vasile's last wish was to convince you to return home. he said he will give you his stable and his flock, so that you don't wander about anymore. Up there, it's always raining with sadness. Uncle Vasile, cousin, leaves the mountain to you to rule it. To me? The mountain? To tie it to the cart, to drag it around the world, with me! Beautiful, coana Marie, beautiful! Thank you! A dwarf approached me last night in a dream and he told me: Bend over, Toma Alistar" And I bent down. And the dwarf says to me again: Bend again, Toma Alistar. Bend again. And I bent down again. And the dwarf relentlessly shouted at me: More! More!! Bend over! Bend over, Toma Alistar! And I bent down again. And he shouted again: Lower! Lower! Lower, Toma Alistar, bend down! And I, helpless, keep bending down. I keep bending over.. and when I thought he would let me get up to see the world around me for once he shouted to me again: "Bend down! Bend down, Toma Alistar!" "More, more, lower!" Lower! And I bend, I bend, I bend... and enter the ground. and all around me is black, black...and black. My little fishes.. Nice hunt.. only it rarely happen... Bad sign. What a bad sign, Toma? It's been a long time since I had so much money as this autumn and winter. I feel them all from afar, like the beast. Only Dragomir and Velcu, you did not smell their flight. Their business. I won't hold you either. Beat it! What's the matter with you, Toma? I don't know. I'm cold. Look, Toma, this is your share of money, a lot of money. That's money, huh? I have been paid in other ways in my life. With something like that. Did you see it? Maybe from an emperor. Bullshit! Dinca, after I'm gone, put it on you. Maybe you won't forget to light a candle for my soul, I also taught you some of my secrets. This is our gang's taxes paid for two years. The document is written in my name, Dinca. I give it to you. Show the paper and say that you are Toma Alistar. Thank you.(Kiss your hand) It has no date. You put it on when you want, you know? I understand, of course! Well, did he give him the documents? What, are you making him our boss, "daddy"? What, is he smarter than us? Yes, "dad". He is smarter. Are you smarter than me? These ones will take all of our money. We show them the record that the taxes are paid. It doesn't work. It doesn't have a date. Come on, let's hide the instruments! Where do we hide your violinist face? Daddy, take out that candle so we can save the pennies, we worked a lot on them. I'm tired of your nonsense. What? Will I be your clown for the rest of my life? Save us one more time, Toma! Do this courtesy. Do this comedy again, please, Toma! Please Toma! Bring the candle! But a new one. Is it somebody alive around here? Look beyond! Yes, sir! Which one of you is the ferryman? The ferryman comes in the afternoon. Yes.. Sopron, where are you lost? We, also are waiting for him to come. Mountain meets mountain, let alone man meets man! (Even if rarely, the mountains can meet one with another, a man with another is more probable) You are from Toma Alistar's gang! It was of Toma Alistar, he died, poor one! I know all your tricks!! Well, this Toma of yours has died dozens of times! Come on, boy, you really don't remember me? In the steppes of Bugeac, one year ago! Well, I'm...Lieutenant Ermurati! You forgot me. Then also you got rid of me with the death trick! But it doesn't matter. It's the end! Now you'll see.. He is very strong.. See, I said.. Sopron, you were right.. He's really dead. Damn you! You did it. You're great, dad! You deserve a beer, father! Get up!! Get up, Toma! "Dad"! Toma! "Dad"! Toma, Toma, my dear! The beech leaf told me... Why aren't the bells ringing...we paid you! and we will pay more if necessary! The priest is not coming! It's not a custom! You are the mockery of God and people, your soul is black with sins! If you pay, I'll go! Toma, your violin fell from your hand... Teacher... and there is also a violinist lying there... That one? He "sang" with 3 pistols and a dagger Great bandit.. He cut the boyars and drink their blood! Radu Negostin, the thief of the Don! Radu Negostin. I say it's all right, isn't it, teacher? Thieves and violinists..a beautiful pair! Lord, free your servant Toma.. Shut up, teacher! His eternal memory.. His eternal memory.. His eternal memory.. Wake up! The Hungarian satra (group of gypsies) has arrived! Rotten rich gypsies! Post from Krakow! My school, it smells like a bargain, a bargain! Fuck you all.. People, people!!! Waltz from "Viana", "Italian canzani"... and the march of Turkish firefighters! Ceardas and Casaciok. We are wonderful! People, people!! here at the inn "Three pistols"! With God's help, we cure people of nausea and hypochondria! We have songs that help with food preparation and wine drinking! He is in love with you! Let me guess for you, kid! May God give you luck.. Leave it for later!...you are so beautiful Well, let me tell you what you will have in your life, what you will think... Yes Manaila, where did you get this slag? I gave it three "kreutzer". Half parrot, half marshal, may those who see you die of shame.... People, People!! People! People, people! Toma Alistar and his band will speak with the violin! People! Songs of passion for your lordships! Doina of Toma Alistaru. Don't be sorry for a golden coin because Toma Alistar is the greatest violinist. Kiss your hand.. Dear guests.. Don't mourn a golden coin for Toma Alistar, because he is the greatest violinist! Where is Toma Alistar? I am Toma Alistar. Are you Toma Alistar? I would whip him a few times. Why? You think that there is only one Toma Alistar in the whole world, right?! Yes. But have you seen him at least once? If you don't believe me, listen. Maybe you know something about him! Why are you crying? I don't cry. Who are you? Leanca. It's not true, you're grey and old! Take this bird. I give it to you! Take it! Come on, go!
