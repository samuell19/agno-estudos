My bank gave me your name, Mr Anderson Neil Swayze from Montreal Grains and fodder - Sit down - Thank you Are you here on business? I might buy a few acres in the area - A cigar? - Thank you New blood is always welcome Mostly young There isn't much left here with the Confederates As a Canadian, I will not take sides Only business interests me I envy you for being neutral Buy cotton from the Confederates for weapons And buy us the weapons for their cotton A risky activity It makes war pleasant and profitable I have a list of properties that are available My employee will show you around them I'll go take a look myself first Where can I find a room? A room or a good table? A good table I recommend Widow Bishop to you Real feather beds, soap and water News of the war They must have caught up with the prisoners Prisoners? Seven officers escaped from Plattsburg Six are still on the loose Lipscomb, close the chest! And the seventh? Our guys killed him 10 bullets in the body 10 balls Follow me Sherman walks on Savannah We're not stopping Sherman My son is in his army Savannah is going to pay off like Atlanta Instead of the general, I would destroy everything They will see Who is this very categorical man? Recruiting Officer Foster He is staying with the widow Bishop Lipscomb, at work! We rush to this news while the outcome of the war is certain I guess Captain Foster has a lot of men with him Only 4, but Lionel acts as if he is leading a regiment I come on behalf of Mr Anderson Everyone comes from him Come in I'll tell Mrs Bishop Captain Bishop Medal of Honor Gettysburg My husband Sorry You're welcome Emmanuel informed me of your coming You want a room, Mr Neil Swayze I didn't mean to stare at you, but I had been told about Widow Bishop I expected an older lady The war makes young widows Sorry Let's talk about the bedroom Do you have one free? Many This way Are you staying long? I do not know I come from Montreal on business It's $ 150 a night and $ 10 a week Meals included According to Mr Anderson, your table is famous Mr Anderson is advertising He has a mortgage on the house We thought it was empty We're playing war Through the windows? This is where the Confederates captured Olga She lives next door Olga Gertz The door next to it We were going to save her Very well Sit down, soldiers Are you staying the week? It will depend Mom prefers weekly clients You are Mrs Bishop's son Is that a Derringer? Are you not a soldier? No, I am Canadian My father smoked the same Mine too My dad killed more Southerners than yours What is your name? Neil Swayze My father was called after me: Larry Are you going to tell mom? I do not know I should? It doesn't scare me, but I don't like pissing him off In fact, you are afraid Soldiers! How about you let me wash it off quietly? See you soon You and Foster have big bedrooms He's here for the week He's a veteran He only has one hand Business is more flourishing in Montreal than here We always manage to find money Even in St Alban You won't be doing business There are hardly any cows or horses left More horses? Twenty-four in all and for all 31, plus the Harvey's mare which is full My son is the authority in St Alban He knows everything Trading with the Southerners must pay off It's fairly fair We sell them what we buy from you Not for me Except to our guests Please excuse me I have mail Mrs Bishop, could I hire your son? I will need a guide tomorrow to show me the properties Can I, mom? You have school - I'll find someone for you - Thank you I think Mr Dansig would take more mash Captain, look! Hello I'd like her to take care of my coat What do you mean? Don't take it the wrong way It's because I'm not very good at sewing This is the right road She walks along the railroad Where does the bridge road lead? Also at the border It is used little She is a little dented I need to wake up Let's do some rodeo! It was one of the best farms in Vermont They left after the death of their two sons in Gettysburg Nobody lives there anymore? Let's take a look There is nothing sadder than an abandoned house It will soon be said that she is haunted - Are we far from town? - 3 km Are you interested? Perhaps I have a weakness for haunted houses Montreal, Canada Monday, October 12, 1864 The main road comes from the border and crosses St Alban It is the only way to and from the city Impossible to condemn this road 15 km from the city, there is a secondary road which joins the border to the east It is a little longer and more rugged but rarely borrowed For us, it's perfect I show you This road crosses the river by this bridge The river is too deep and too rough If we destroy this bridge, our retirement is assured to Canada The farm that I found on this road 15 km from the bridge is isolated Ideal for hiding our troops Our attacking forces will cross the border here and hide in the farm In 5 minutes, they will be in town St Alban has a lot of guns? They will have to be located before the attack Take care of yourself! Rest Sorry to interrupt Your volunteers are downstairs, ready to fight You're welcome I'm almost done One group will take the steeple, and the other the roof of the school Here and there Thus, we will control the place This is your mission, Mr Duprey Captain, you'll cut the telegraph lines and you will storm the Commercial Bank I take care of the National Bank Robinson, the State Bank Here, across the street I've always dreamed of burning a bank Except the money We will burn more than their banks The smell of war will sicken them Then they will understand how important our homes are Can I intervene? Of course We all have reasons to Some more than others But keep in mind that it is not guerrilla warfare We will plunder the city, but like an act of war It's the Confederate army in uniform who will attack more than 1000 km from the front After St Alban, we will strike again Our goal is to force the enemy to scatter his troops to help General Lee Can we burn everything? Of course Destroy the city But first, this city will have to be stripped of the smallest dollar To buy arms from the English Everything is ready? We attack next Saturday, the 17th, at noon Some of the officers, Dwyer, Ramsey, Robinson, will be going to St Alban this week The others will arrive on Friday Perfect I return to the consulate See the volunteers I can talk to you? I go down I do not have a mission You are too risky for me I have already told you I know I was wrong I would like to have behaved differently, but I have the right to come I languished in this prison like the others Don't stop me from doing it The is not the question Understand me I am from the South like the others I know I was wrong It will not happen again You have my word I will think about it I will let you know Thank you 5th Georgia Regiment, right? Corporal Fred Dean Company C Nice to see you again Or were you imprisoned? ASpringfield We escaped recently Do you remember me? I was with you in Gettysburg Of course Henry Latimer, right? Old friends Sit down You know our goal Attack the Yankees wallet We're going to burn this town down It's time Let's go It's going to be hard to slip us into St Alban Even more to get by We will have to make choices You will be in civilian clothes until the attack You know what to expect if you are arrested: the firing squad Very well Dean Latimer Go through there Come on, please Read this "I am a Canadian citizen I was born in Montreal" It's hard to take you for a Yankee The other side I could learn Yankee if you want We do not have time Next Sorry, but I'm from Kentucky Next Wednesday October 14 Sherman, at the gates of Savannah, wants to destroy the city How was Montreal? Cold Lipscomb is at your disposal Mrs Bishop is looking after me The war will soon end The price of land is increasing I will come on Saturday 3 days is a long time I can't before At Saturday noon It's better than being in Montreal Keeps a cool head I know what I'm doing It will burn well With this money, the colonel may be able to pay our arrears For time spent in prison: over $ 500 So what? I like money for what I can buy Save your eyes for Saturday We can combine war and fun, right? Not at my house A good Yankee is a dead Yankee These trophies, collected by our men in Vermont, will be auctioned in St Alban Saturday evening, October 17, 1864 Do you still think about pleasure? Let's go Whenever you doubt, look at this poster No need to remind me You're not the only one There is another who thinks of pleasure Don't worry about the major 40 arpents of cotton torn up and his house set on fire He hates them more than us Perhaps I intend to make sure he doesn't change his mind This is our hotel Let's stop Okay I never miss a deal and here is a promising cart - Do you have brooms? - Of course Show your rotisseries It's a promotion $ 250 - You wish? - A salt and a pepper shaker I will see Sorry, we don't have any more You have to leave No hawking on the square It's not fair They seem pretty honest It's unfair, they work Many laws are How about a pension next to yours? - Please tidy up - It's not very friendly You just have to go to another city They are not criminals Let them go door-to-door Wait a minute, sheriff Katy, leave this question to lawyers Can a citizen not ask a question? Is there no law against door-to-door? Of course not You must be right Stay away from stores Thank you so much It was nice of you No shopping for me today Keep working without upsetting the sheriff Thank you He will hardly notice us We must not let it down but throw it away with force! It's okay, put out the fire It works We will see that tomorrow As we will not see each other again, let's recap 8 men with me 12 rounds of ammunition 6 bombs each Everyone in uniform Be near the station at 11:50 am Wait for the signal to cut the telegraph lines 2 squads with me In position to the north A squad 100 meters from the square When you open fire, we'll get the horses out When the bells ring noon, Keating, Robinson, and I will be coming to the square I'll shoot for the signal Questions? Who takes care of the houses in the square? - We won't have time - We'll take it Sherman makes no exceptions Houses, soldiers, civilians everything is good Kill civilians would delay us It didn't bother the Yankees to kill my wife I know, but we have to get over it St Alban is just the start Do you have reasons to be against kill civilians? Do you have a reason for asking this? Is there an order not to kill Yankees? No Saturday 17th October We had trouble convincing the Reverend He was afraid that selling dances does not transform St Alban into Sodom It's a nerdy Where did you learn this word? - From Wrinkles Pagent - No I am the culprit We were chatting and I used that word I wanted to say - Old game - Yes, old game Who were you talking about? No more gossip It will be necessary to earn money with the drinks, the dances and the auction Wrinkles' dad wants a Southerner sword I would like one too I have no memories of killing Southerners Katy, if you'll excuse me With Delphine, we hope you will buy our dances He called you by your first name You too Don't compare an acquaintance to a lifelong friend Lionel, don't be cheesy They never grow up They still love the parades Soldiers The major arrives Go forward and return to the farm I take care of others Trader! Do you have any tobacco? Only utensils Hold! Take a cigar Thank you Are you staying long? No, we're leaving for Plattsburg on Monday morning Good cigar Let him suffocate you! Where are you going? No need to fight They leave on Monday - We can take care of them - Come back! This is not what will scare us Go away It's an order You have a visitor Mom is decorating the hall for the ball I'm busy at the moment Okay You are Canadian? File - Why are you here? - He had to Keating is missing What do you mean? I looked for it everywhere He drank?

Exact Are you out of cigars? Do you have one left? I was just asking Robinson is watching the south You better go back We are waiting for you You can't miss Keating Be a friend and subscribe to this channel Mr Swayze, this is Lieutenant Sidney Sorry for this afternoon I was a bit abrupt You don't have to apologize I really had a date It couldn't wait Are you waiting for someone? No, I admired your decoration - Is that your job? - In part It was the one I admired It would appear very rustic in Montreal On the contrary, very refined Have you always lived in Montreal? Not always Or? In places you don't know And that I will never know You never wanted to leave here? Often But the roots are too deep They tear off easily Ask the soldiers They are experts Atlanta, Chattanooga Savannah It is unfair It's difficult when you're neutral to understand this war Imagine someone from the South whose house was burnt down by General Sherman and his devastated family How would you explain this war to him? What were they expecting? To the good manners of the South? They would destroy us if they could What if they burned St Alban? Would you understand them? Will you forgive them? I waited for you We had an appointment on Monday, right?

I do not know My sermon will deal with My sermon will deal with a subject which is very dear to us A subject dear to all patriots The rebellion It is good to remember than our Holy Bible has a lot to say on this subject Chapter 15 of the Book of Samuel: "The rebellion "is equivalent to witchcraft" Chapter 17 of Proverbs: "The evil man seeks only rebellion" Mr Lincoln told us not long ago only for free men there is no hesitation between the ballot boxes or the balls Can we doubt which side is the Lord? We are right and with His help our legions must make the Rebels bite the dust Satan himself will have to make room in his domain to welcome these lost souls You Yankee vermin! Who wants to try? Who? Tell your friend the devil to welcome you No one God bless you This man must be a Southerner Anyone know him? Was he here all alone? He was at the hotel with a friend Let's take it out Well done, Brother Swayze If there is anything I can do You are a hero like my father, aren't you? Yeah, Larry Did you see how he shot? God guided your hand The officers are there Come on, corporal Sorry for Keating We tried to stop him I know Staying here doing nothing is not much help I made a mistake taking her It was too risky Is that delaying us?

It is made for that You have been wonderful Major, there is a troop on the other side of the hill Mr Ramsey, tell the men to get in the saddle Two platoons 6 km away Let's bar their way These carts will not suffice I was talking about a human barrier Two armed men can keep them at bay So we can get to the bridge Drop One more thing Remember what you said when we left Henderson "Did we dig this tunnel for nothing?" And what you said to Keating "We have to get out of this St Alban is just the start" They're coming! Captain Foster Take them to the other end of the square and hold them back Do not move He wants to block the road with us I gave you an order It's like in Atlanta or in Chattanooga Stay where you are All Captain, I'll go near your wagon If these people don't move, take Foster and kill him!
