prettier sight than three little gals who've gone wrong gone right. well they traded their button-up shoes for slogging boots and their fancy wines for sorghum molasses fat vat and bulldog gravy they crossed the muddy prairie to help him stake his claim and josh gave him a brand new home and a new adopted name two faded lilacs one soil dove are building them a new life with a man in the land they love them three city thistles turned into rat nice prairie sunflowers reckon it takes a wildcat woman to tame a wilderness. the daughters of joshua cave the daughters of joshua cave well ... there

prison i've forgotten plus which you forgot that i'm having a talk with mayor bagley this temporary sheriff has gone on too long we'll get out them bearskins next week all right if we can see it knows for dinner wouldn't hurt none if we used to smell some huckleberry pie when we get back either huh goodbye well we tried chances are they won't see me when i go in town well if it was me i wouldn't go yes you would matt cobley wasn't interested in you just this land change from times past don't may well the way his invitation was made i think it's best i accept do you want us to come with you sure we'll go no i don't think so i'll handle him where the warning marshall you keep your death side of this and he'll have you jog to death six miles out of town no territorial prison is gonna hold me i'll be back for you too see what i mean why you flat fungal you've been in this tin box nearly a week you broke out of nothing but runny mouth ever since josh arrested you and if he ain't the main just excuse for a law man this side of the picture let's go dutton the mistake that made you sheriff i'm gonna put right put that in your book you ever hear the likes of that yeah well you're right about one thing wearing this badge is a mistake it is just temporary you sound like a mayor it's been temporary for six months you heard didn't you the sheriff wheeler was seen down tombstone a while back yeah i heard if he's not seen up here in grand forks mighty soon grand forks is going to have to elect a new permanent sheriff you know who that'll be i'm no law man huh well that was a long time ago i'm a rancher i have been a rancher for 26 years got a homestead that needs brewing up on for a loser and grand fork spreads a couple more miles east that homestead is going to be in the town limits now instead of being a struggling rancher you're going to be a very wealthy land no sir if you just took matt cobby's offer to buy you out you could be a pretty rich temporary sheriff right now i'll take nothing from that oily mouth walloper before martha died he agreed that land was going to be a working ranch and that's what it's going to be not part of a town something i can leave the girls look at that yeah because you don't have the brains god gave a gopher will you stop yelling at me stop yelling at you you're lucky i don't ram this boom handle up your nose oh look what you did to my garden what's going on here well i almost got trampled and she's all worried about her stupid garden i could have been killed you still could be miss high and mighty light fingers will you two hush but did you see what she did to my garden did you hear what she just called me do you know how long it is i did not come home to referee another one of your squabbles i came home to eat my dinner it isn't ready well it's 12 o'clock noon well maybe milk the cow well i needed milk for the biscuits there wasn't anything yeah so feather head started to milk the cow while it was nursing its calves how was i supposed to know how was i supposed to know ain't no way a body would ever know you two wasn't really blood sisters i want my dinner now forget the biscuits cream chicken on biscuits without biscuits cream chicken on biscuits without the biscuits where is mei mei your sister she's not here all right let's have it now she went into grand forks what for well see matt cobley matt cobley but what will josh think i hate to say that but young ladies of my day had better sense businesses of course danish girls will raise with a greater sense of propriety you told me that before miss essay simple put you should not be seen with him in public after him romeo and you the way he did and then to find out the real reason ah hello man we'll wait a few minutes to order mrs cargo thanks for coming how could i refuse how you look as lovely as ever don't push it man it's taking everything i've got to keep from scratching your eyes out i always did like a lady with restrained fire did you really well just think if josh had found his real daughters i'd never met you how did you find out by hiring the best private detectives in st louis that money could buy owning josh's land will be more than worth the cost i'm sure it could be so is the expense of the lawyer i've retained you've been busy the lawyer too the homestead claims josh filed under your and your sister's names they're invalid adopted daughters but with or without questionable reputations are ineligible you've really been busy i've been trying to sort you through out tell me now were you the one josh got out of glenville prison or the pickpocket which do you think may i get you some more no thank you i'm not thirsty exposing your identities would cost josh's land that would keep him from paying off his debts here in grand forks proud man that he is he'd probably kill himself trying yes he probably would his place would be opened again for homesteading and i'd be forced to use other means of acquiring it now on the other hand we could keep our secret i could pay him enough to clear up what he owes plus a little to start over somewhere else and you three could get back to saint louis i mean this this really isn't a lie for you is it you go along with me or not me he's going to lose that land and it'll be up to you to decide whether or not he'll have anything to show for the years he's put into it hello josh you'll forgive me if i don't stand i thought the cave family had finished with you no i'm a very determined man and persuasive how persuasive enough to convince me we should reconsider his offer i'll be in touch with you later now wait a minute here josh this isn't the time of place maybe you better start thinking about moving to california out of these cold wyoming winters that homestead will be taking over my dead body and i'll take a ringtail vial there'll be another dead body before mine that's what we figured out yeah that's what we figured may come storm in a few minutes ago i couldn't get a word out of her she wouldn't even look at me where is she inside the house there was aidan charity i could see they needed space to talk so i just let them be it's bad huh could be depends on how much is rubbed off on them these past few months well how much can all this really mean to them anyway no matter how you look at it josh they're just three city girls from st louis and all the pretending in the world ain't gonna change that my daughter there are three girls you got in st louis when you couldn't find your real daughters it isn't like we didn't expect to go back to st louis eventually it's really just a matter of time i guess when's been decided for it matt cobley said either way you lose the homestead clay sort of makes our staying here kind of senseless well i guess i wasn't as smart as i thought i was when i filed that claim selling this land to him will at least give you something yes and whatever it is you'd all have a share of it no no it is yours and uncle bitter roots well some things you just can't fight no my homestead claim the government land office says is no good like that them ready to call it quits and go back to st louis well that's something else you bet it is now you listen to me josh there's no sense you keep your peace miss until i finished you know this land means a lot to me for a lot of reasons most of them you know about evidently you don't know how much you all mean to me well if you don't it's too bad i i just won't spell it out for you thanks to matt cobley government land office might decide i have no legal claim to this place i just might lose it but i'm not going to lose you you're staying right here in this valley if possible but wherever with me and me i'll just stay put until i get back where are you going we're in blazes do you think so duncan what the w doing in my room well wait just a minute i asked your question where do you think you're going what are you doing in my room huh where's matt comey is he going out josh i've got a matter i want to discuss with him he's in his room or is he going out he's in his room where is it it's number six josh i know you have reason to be angry with open up cobbly it's josh cave as he told me you're in there i want to talk to you we've got something to settle and we're going to settle it once and for all you murdered him no joshua cave you've known him as long as you've lived in grand forks he's lived in this valley longer than this town has been here he's serving as your sheriff during the present absence of ben wheeler now is your judgment so bad that you could have picked a a murderer to protect yourselves and your families i think not just as i think you will deny the charge of premeditated murder i know that your verdict will vindicate my belief as it will vindicate your friends fortunately for the sake of justice i don't share your personal acquaintanceship with the accused one of the advantages of being a circuit judge new to the territory as such i'm able to look at the evidence from an unclouded point of view that evidence clearly points to a definite threat of death made in the presence of several townspeople present in this courtroom it even includes the somewhat grudging testimony of mrs cargo a close friend of the accused who told of sheriff cabe's anger just prior to the killing then there's the testimony of clel tonkins who heard a cry and some scuffling coming from the murder room located just next to his and finally the testimony of the man who saw the actual death struggle gentlemen you have a duty despite your personal feelings and strictly in light of the testimony to return your verdict and i remind you bias has no place in a court of law that flag stands for he will be vindicated gentleman of the jury have you reached a verdict we have your honor how do you find we find joshua cave guilty of murder in the first degree prisoner will rise you've been found guilty by a jury of your peers murder is a foul deed it is even more foul when committed by one sworn to uphold the law your crime touches all of us so dedicated i hereby send you to be taken to the territorial prison there in 30 days time to be hanged by the neck until you are dead taking things like this you keep that bedroom may honey this was martha's wedding ring would you hold that oh josh now the appeal to the governor for a new trial is automatic sure is that'll postpone the hanging indefinitely don't use that word all right i won't you promise not to worry but you're innocent i know and we'll prove it somehow but that god-forsaken hellhole they call the territorial prison that's no place for a manual age josh what essie cargo what do you mean a man of my age are you trying to add josh be near dark before we get there as it is now he is not going to hang thinking about dutton a man josh sent to territorial prison last week he swore he did josh you sure won't get a better chance at it hey any word from that lawyer fellow picker he got a letter from the territorial government is there going to be a new trial not without new evidence but there is hope let me tell you what jim piguet said will you listen to someone who's been there once they get you behind bars they don't want to let you go they're not gonna keep josh behind bars for long he's gonna hang in less than three weeks don't say that it's true i just hold up there he ain't hanged yet and there's something else come on tell him missy jim pickett is going to try to get the governor to commute the death sentence to life we know in a week or so life in prison oh no poor josh you call that something now wait a minute listen to me can't you see that that if his sentences what do you call that community commuted it'll give us time to work for his release well what if the governor refuses yeah he won't he won't damn it he won't he can't he promised that's a new trial if we got some new evidence what new evidence is there i mean are you going to be able to get the people who hurt josh threatened to heal codley to say they didn't hear it or or that clel tonkins to say he didn't hear what he heard from from room at essie's or the drummer to say he didn't see what he saw there is no new evidence there will be there has to be and there will be there will be darling i swear josh ain't gonna hang no he won't hang cause we're gonna break him out of that prison oh charlie now you back up that wagon there peter won't leave her you heard what she said yes i heard what she said and she knows that's impossible she's going to wait for jim picken to do what he can aren't your charity and we are going to put our trust in prayers to the lord but trust and prayers to the lord is what essie said charity there's just no way we could do it will you listen to me i have been in and out of more prisons than you two have even heard of and i'm telling you we can do it and for putting trust and prayers to the lord i agree but like an old boxer friend of mine used to say in a fight prayers help if you got a good right cross okay seven dollars ready make it ten i'm sorry bitty seven dollars but i can buy it back certainly yes you see i keep it for 90 days and then i sell it for whatever i can get for it so i almost forgot this uh uncle bitterroot asked me to pick it up hmm tell me mate how are you folks getting around oh not easily mr collier but we'll make it of course you will love now let's see that will come to uh 4 35 all together but don't worry i'll keep it in the book thank you you're welcome there you are bye bye bye bye oh could i have the fourth shot mr collins portia ready thank you gotta be very tough on you girls being out there all alone well uncle bitterroot is

drops of this lad and a glass of water will help you to sleep tonight shader it's been almost impossible to sleep since papa went to prison i understand a real shame that you three girls are bearing up most admirably i think you're truly remarkable you're a source of great joy to josh i know you are thank you dr reed oh this ought to be enough flinny how's it going almost finished you know we got to figure out a way to get uncle bitterroot out of here when the time comes well why don't we just give him two or three of these london cookies so sleep for hours there'll be plenty left for josh to give the prison guys you would have let me eat that well you've been working hard enough what do you good i oughta bring you take it easy you'll make the cake for it oh is that where you put the derringer in my little little angel food cake honey good good which loaf of bread did you put the all right hi uncle bitterroad you look tired yeah how about how about a cookie what a smell aroma smell just hear bread ain't nothing else in the world smells like it you make my kind heavy bread you know josh likes light bread this here's real soft bread you can just get it there in the gravy and soft it up like you're supposed to without it coming apart in here tarnishing a file come back here you what have you three been up to what a thimble-headed idea did you think you could get that file past those guards in that bread uncle better wrote don't you uncle bitter root me why did it found out that i had you by the script you forgot to take the bullets out bullets out of what boy he can sure hold a grudge it's only been a week you guys let us out of a site for a minute you know i'm telling you i'm getting sick and tired of uh taking a bath with a rope tight around my ankle and him outside the door holding the other end hasn't been that bad it has almost irish just on my way to see you well we come in for supplies i have some news from one of my new borders about what about josh no about the drummer who said he saw josh and matt copley fighting or body he has been arrested down in sweetwater what for i don't know but it's worth looking into after all one of the key witnesses against josh has been arrested it sure is i should be back from sweetwater about friday so we're putting an awful lot of hope in a mighty slim chance that drummers being arrested will mean anything yeah well don't tell me this is a waste of time the waste isn't only not doing more yeah like what well like wait a minute i don't want to hear i want your solemn word that you won't set foot off this land except for fire flood or tornado till i get back do you understand whatever you say uncle bitter ate it on it's all in promise i'll go get a root me what in the world could we do don't forget we want your word bye uncle peter i don't know about this i really don't name me a better way to get inside the territorial prison well so we get inside what makes you think it'll do josh any good experience honey but what if it doesn't work what if we get killed i've got a worse thought what if we get away with it i know you look all right you look fine come on come all right now you youngsters don't get itchy come on up against the coach let me see all your hands threw it in the box can't do that young feller dad blame it i can't do that because i care no box get some valuables

thing was to get inside the prison isn't that what you said that's what i said then we figure out a way to get josh out right right and you tell me my idea won't work i won't tell you that it might i won't tell you that it might okay it might but if we try i'm gonna be the one to do it oh no if we try i'll be the one frankly you couldn't carry it off what do you mean i couldn't carry it off well it's gonna take a certain a-clad and you simply don't have a clat are you insulting me oh now sister would i insult you twelve to the road gang twelve returned well the royal gang well returned you don't have a problem with these wretches stealing any of your supplies in here hardly miss hopewell tightly run ship a warden as you will see fascinating truly fascinating as you could call it that i suppose no i was referring more to the reading my article will hold for our newspaper subscribers that's a rather strange profession for a young woman feature writing well not if you're the only child of a newspaper publisher who always wanted a son you actually walk unarmed around the prisoners i explain this hope well there are definite deterrents to their making trouble that man with the rifle there he's a crack marksman anyone who comes within six feet of us is in danger of being summarily shot what are those uh gatling guns automatic fire to mow men down like wheat you see miss hopewell insurrections are planned let me show you something the cage they never know when for how long or which ones to be held there but the first sign of trouble whoever is behind those bars will be shot pretty difficult to plan an uprising under those conditions wouldn't you say yes i would also say that um it seems an impossibility that any of these men could ever escape from here i would say the same thing an interesting point warden mannering would you say that the gallows are a deterrent to is hopeful it's a known fact the prisoners who climbed those steps do not repeat their crimes well something that strikes me warden mannering is the overriding feeling of hopelessness here it's not by accident i assure you ms hope well that was the intent of the army when they used this place to hold indian hostiles yet deep in the breast of the most lost soul there must be a glimmer of hope and that's as it should be oh one of the many suppliers of food for the prison suppliers contracted by the territorial prison authority they're all alike the scurviest lot in the world my manifest check it let me unload and get out of here bureaucratic systems i guarantee you what's written here is not what's been paid for there's a story for you put it over there by the kitchen yeah this piece of paper is their license to steal no inspectors no guarantee what the quality is no telling what the kickback is you know i came for a story on the territorial prison but i'm beginning to wonder if it shouldn't be on yourself you're such an interesting man warden mannering i mean oh miss hopewell what's the matter i seem to have gotten something in my eye ah well here let me help you tilt your head back that's why i look up there oh you've gotten it well i couldn't find anything oh yes but you've gotten it thank you it's fine well mannering if my editor agrees um may i assume that it would be all right for me to return for another visit with you i know the power of the press ms hope will well i uh had no intention of staying here indefinitely i do have plans beyond my present station well well well um yes by all means dear lady come back any time you choose josh cape yeah i'm supposed to tell you your appeal's been denied you hang on schedule in six days i hear right old man they're actually gonna hang you well then they just fix it so i don't have to kill you at least he knows we're here and we're gonna do something not something what i worked out i don't know it's awful risky well so is josh's hanging anyway have either of you got a better idea i sure haven't look a little doctrine of that manifest a trip to that farm we passed on the way back and we're on our way to getting josh out on our way with an awful long way to go it'll work wow i've seen prison locked before but that there's a phyllis stuff i ever see where do you people come from well my daddy come from back missouri way and with my mom she come from thank you very much the manifest woman give me the manifest i swear one of these days one of you people are gonna bring a plague into this place well it looks to me like the plague might be just the thing to bring it to where it's livable what are you gaping at it's that long since you've seen a woman what's written here has been changed what like you didn't know well it wasn't done by me i can't cipher all i know is is that my daddy told me to deliver you six crazy chickens talk chickens every crate that's just what i've done if you don't believe me you can ride around there and count them for yourself how many were contracted for how many were what oh what difference does it make everybody has to make his somewhere down the line i suppose unload them over there yeah well i'm gonna need some help you you you give her a hand hold on there now just a minute that's just what they give me a hand i asked for help i don't know how long they've been in here but they ain't refreshing their memory slips sliding up next to me no thank you now you just pay attention to me i'll take him and a few of them other sunset types all right you three get to it get these crates unloaded already you grilled up too much you know where it is just be ready governor if you commit my sentence to hangings and forward eh that's why you got to get picked for work on the road gang before then self recovery i hardly recognized you you remember me don't you your sister used to bring me my meals in grand forks jail well oh josh here give me particulars to the escape won't you josh he's not there i see he's not there it's two days now only two more believe it or not i can add two i know how many days are left there's still time to try something else like what if you're sitting there with some genius idea let's have it come on let's hear your brilliant thoughts aydah i know we're running out of time and i know i insist that we do it my way hey go ahead say it it's all my fault that josh is going to hang oh come on we didn't mean it like that of course not i'm scared it's gonna be okay girls anybody home somebody answer me like as if there was somebody to answer hey there me charity i still don't know if they try something as soon as my back was turned 49 right up for why not a week ago when jim pickett could still do something about it will you listen to me there still may be times oh not the way that governor lolly gagged around

right for a man your age i'll show you what age has got to do with trying to save a friend's life listen even if you do get to the prison in time without official word from the governor to the contrary the warden will have no choice but to hang josh there is no way to get to the governor on time let alone get into prison you say that's the way it's gotta be i accept it then you gotta accept

though or it might have been the sight of those two little lovelies we had out there a little lovely what do you thought well just before we quit wagon ran off with two of the looks of this young girls i've seen a long time and one of them twisted her ankle an old doc pierce here was asked to have a look at it and what could you do squat it down like this she put her foot right there and she raised her skirt all the way up to her knee and then i gave her a pretty little ankle and a number one examination i even touched it then what happened then what happened yeah we got back in their wagon and went home i need funny peters guard ma'am i'm ready to leave now you can open the gate that certainly was a long day but a fruitful one uh the gate please open it warden manon is such a fascinating man don't you think my story is going to make hope well we're mannering it's so good to see you again your willingness to let me do a story on you has boosted my stock on the paper at least a hundred points when the territorial governor heard of the idea and reacted so favorably well you can imagine my editor's attitude toward me territorial governor oh yes he and my editor would function in cheyenne i must say it was a pleasant surprise to find your name so regarded so high up really don't you agree indeed i do oh i'm glad to me you're speaking out on those issues more correctly show your depth of character and your integrity than any words of mine i couldn't think of a better way to dramatize evil what you think i'd turn the cage let's go oh wait on your feet where's josh i sat on your feet i want to see the warden shut your mouth and do what you're told that's one of his daughters warden josh cade's escape guard bring that prisoner here did i hear someone say josh cabers escaped i will find him you understand i assure you of that believe me they won't he's a long way from here by now well you're going to stay here until they do i am my dear young lady aiding and abetting the escape of a prisoner is a felony now hold on there she's going to stand trial you're absolutely right warden uncle bitter root and i'll see to it myself she does this here bad says she's my prisoner you two can't make a fool of me that's all you're concerned about seems to me the way you ought to look at is that you don't have to hang an innocent man it's terrible to think you would have hanged josh knowing he didn't murder that man the court said he did kill him the judge said to hang him well uncle bitter would almost kill this horse and himself to get here to tell you that the real murderer confessed my orders were to hang him on the 27th that's tomorrow now unless the governor changes those orders when my men bring him back he'll and to hang i was going to write an important article on you good afternoon mr collins any news from josh not a word uh that's strange after better in a week of his escaping i hear tell that warden manor and fella is still looking for him no well old josh will turn up when a time comes root oh gosh ah sure is dragging on and off a long time isn't it you mean dragging on josh what you think he'd have got in touch with somebody by now wouldn't you yeah you'd have thought that right enough yeah well i suppose all we can do is wait and hope here's you ain't gonna hide no more josh josh well what? jim pickett just got
