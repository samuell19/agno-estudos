[dog barking] WHERE'S HE AT? SHOOTING BILLIARD POOL OVER AT TIMBERLINE BAR. DID YOU ROUND UP A COMMITTEE? [horse neighing] COME ON, BOYS! MOOSE MATLOCK'S HERE AND THE TAR'S BUBBLING. WHO'S MOOSE AFTER THIS TIME? HEY! WHO'S MOOSE AFTER? BANJO HACKETT. BANJO'S BACK IN TOWN? HE'S GOT A DEAD LETTER HERE. MOOSE CLAIMS THAT BANJO ROOKED HIM INTO BUYING SOME SURPLUS ARMY MULES, AND NOT ONE OF THEM WAS WORTH A DANG. MEN WOULD THINK THAT. DO YOU KNOW SOMETHING DIFFERENT? EVERYBODY KNOWS BANJO'S HONEST ENOUGH AS HORSE TRADERS GO, AND A FINE FIGURE OF A MAN. WHAT I HEARD WAS THAT MOOSE CAME HOME EARLY FROM HIS KNIGHTS OF COLUMBUS MEETING AND HE FOUND THE BACK WINDOW OPEN. YOU DON'T MEAN TO SAY-- AND THE CURTAINS FLUTTERING. OH ME, OH MY. AND HIS PRETTY WIFE WAS ALL SMILES. OOH. HERE IT IS. LOOKS LIKE IT'S STILL MY SHOT, JUDGE. UNLESS MY GUESS IS WRONG, THAT HORSE IS AS BLIND AS A NOONDAY OWL. SPARES HIM DISTRACTIONS. EXCUSE ME, JUDGE. I HATE TO BRING UP UNGENTLEMANLY CONDUCT, HACKETT, BUT BRINGING IN A BLIND HORSE MAKES A MOCKERY OF FAIR PLAY. NO RULE AGAINST IT, JUDGE. IT FLOUTS GOOD SPORTSMANSHIP. (Banjo) WHO'S SPORTIN'? [horse neighing] WHOA, WHOA THERE! THAT HORSE IS STONE DEAF, TOO! AIN'T THAT MIRACULOUS? JUST LIKE HE WAS BORN FOR THE JOB. NOW LOOK HERE, HACKETT, IF I HAD A DEVIOUS MIND, I MIGHT SUSPECT YOU WERE TRYING TO UNLOAD THAT MISERABLE CREATURE ON ME. JUDGE, HOW CAN YOU SAY SUCH A THING? WHOA, THERE, TAXI, WHOA. YOU KNOW, I GOT HIM OFF A TAXIDERMIST UP IN IDAHO. COULDN'T TRAIN HIM NOT TO BLINK. DON'T TRIFLE WITH ME! STILL, I MIGHT BE PERSUADED TO TAKE THAT MISERABLE PLUG OFF YOUR HANDS AS--AS A PERSONAL FAVOR. HOW MUCH? $100 EVEN. FOR A BLIND HORSE? NONSENSE! NOT A PENNY OVER $50. MIGHT COME DOWN TO $90. THERE'S A LETTER HERE FOR BANJO HACKETT. THANK YOU, MA'AM. YOU'RE WELCOME. $60 AND THAT'S FINAL. LET'S FORGET THE WHOLE THING. WELL, MAYBE, UH, $65. [sniffs] WHAT'S THAT I'M SMELLING? WELL, I KNOW YOU'RE ON A GOVERNMENT SALARY. $75 IS MY ROCK BOTTOM. ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT! DONE. NOW LET'S SHAKE ON IT. THEY TARRIN' THE STREETS? NOW YOU GET DOWN OFF MY HORSE. TAR? BANJO HACKETT, WE WANT YOU! YOU BLIND... [horse neighing] RIDE, BANJO, RIDE. HEAD HIM OFF AT THE DRUGSTORE! STOP HIM! THAT'S MY HORSE! NOBODY HARM THAT HORSE! [sighs] 1 AND 2 AND OUT WITH THE BAD AIR, IN WITH THE GOOD. AND 1 AND 2 AND OUT WITH THE BAD AIR, IN WITH THE GOOD. AND 1 AND 2 AND OUT WITH THE BAD AIR, IN WITH THE GOOD. AND 1 AND 2 AND OUT WITH THE BAD AIR, IN WITH THE GOOD. AND 1 AND 2 AND OUT WITH THE BAD AIR. AND 1 AND 2 AND OUT WITH THE BAD AIR, IN WITH THE GOOD. AND 1 AND 2... HEY, WHAT'RE YOU DOING? HEY, LEMME GO! LEMME GO! DAG-NABBIT! (Mister Creed) COMPANY, HALT! (Jubal) HEY, CUT IT OUT. LEMME GO! CAN'T YOU SEE I'M A POOR LITTLE ORPHAN BOY? I WAS ONE, TOO. AND I'M GONNA TEACH YOU A SECRET, KID. (Mister Creed) STAND FAST! LEARN HOW TO TAKE IT UNTIL YOU'RE BIG ENOUGH TO DISH IT OUT. YOU DIRTY SKUNK! YOU STINK! (Mister Creed) THAT WILL DO. THAT WILL DO! I'M OBLIGED TO YOU, SIR. IF THERE'S A BOUNTY ON HIM, MAKE IT PAYABLE TO SAMUEL IVORY. THERE'S A SAM IVORY WHO'S FAMOUS AS A MANHUNTER AND PISTOLEER. WOULD YOU BY CHANCE BE ONE AND THE SAME? NOTHING ABOUT ME IS BY CHANCE. WELL? WHAT HAVE YOU TO SAY? LOOK AT ME! YOU REFUSE TO LEARN. WELL, MY LITTLE MAN, YOU WILL! (Mister Creed) ALL RIGHT, YOU BOYS. COME ALONG. FOLLOW ME. CATHERINE! IT'S ME. YES? SHE BUSY WITH A FITTING OR SOMETHING? WHO MIGHT YOU BE? I'M BANJO, CATHERINE'S BROTHER. OH, DEAR. THE ONE SHE WROTE ALL THOSE LETTERS TO IN CARE OF GENERAL DELIVERY. SHE SAID SHE WAS AILING, BUT THAT WAS A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO. BET SHE'S UP TO SNUFF BY NOW THOUGH, AIN'T SHE? I'M AFRAID NOT. I... PLEASE ACCEPT MY CONDOLENCES. NO. THAT--THAT SHOULDN'T BE. SHE WAS MY ONLY SISTER. WHAT A PITY YOU WEREN'T HERE. STILL, YOU'LL BE HAPPY TO KNOW THERE WAS A GOOD TURNOUT WHEN SHE WAS PUT TO REST. IT WAS DONE SIMPLY, OF COURSE, WITHOUT YOUR USUAL COSTLY FRILLS. FOLKS UNDERSTOOD. THE POOR THING. SHE HAD ALL THOSE DEBTS. I'LL SQUARE 'EM. NO. THERE'S NO NEED. THE SHERIFF'S AUCTION WAS A WEEK AGO LAST THURSDAY. EVERYTHING WENT, OF COURSE. WHAT ABOUT HER BOY, MY NEPHEW? POOR JUBAL. REALLY, THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE WE COULD DO. SAY, FROM THE SMELL OF THAT BARBERSHOP TONIC, I'D SAY YOU AIM TO HIRE ONE OF OUR BUGGIES TO DO SOME SPARKING, HUH? ALL I WANT IS AN ANSWER. SURE, WHAT'S THE QUESTION? WHERE'S DIDO'S LAMENT? WHERE'S WHAT? (Pegram) IN THE NAME OF GOD, MISTER. THE TRUTH. HEY HO! OH, WILEY, YOU IN THERE? WILEY? GET OUT HERE AND TEND TO BUSINESS! WHO DONE THIS, WILEY? STRANGER. MEAN EYES, SMELLING OF BAY RUM TONIC. LOOKS WORSE THAN IT IS. WHERE DO YOU KEEP YOUR MEDICINES? OVER THERE. BANJO, YOU REMEMBER THAT LITTLE CHESTNUT MARE, THE ONE YOU GIVE JUBAL HIS LAST BIRTHDAY? DIDO'S LAMENT. YEAH, I WAS MEANING TO ASK YOU ABOUT HER. YEAH, THAT'S WHAT THAT STRANGER WAS ASKING ABOUT, TOO. HE MUST HAVE FOUND OUT I BOUGHT HER AT THE AUCTION. GOT HER PASTURED OUT SOMEWHERE? UH-UH. SOLD HER THE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY. SAY, WHAT'VE WE GOT HERE? "CENTAUR BRAND CORDIAL INVIGORANT." THAT OUGHT TO DO THE TRICK. BANJO, I USE THAT FOR HORSE LINIMENT. SAYS RIGHT THERE, "GREAT REMEDY FOR MAN OR BEAST, INTERNAL OR EXTERNAL." [moans] I RECKON YOU, UH, TOLD HIM WHO BOUGHT JUBAL'S MARE OFF OF YOU. HE HAD THAT PITCHFORK! WHAT'S IT TO ME ANYWAY, BANJO? I TOLD HIM IT'S ICHABOD, THE TRAVELING TINKER AND KNIFE SHARPENER, JUST PASSING THROUGH TOWN. WHICH WAY WAS HE TRAVELING? SOUTH. BANJO, IS THERE SOMETHING SPECIAL ABOUT THAT HORSE? YEP. BUT THERE AIN'T BUT ONE OTHER PERSON IN THE WHOLE WORLD, EXCEPT ME, WHO KNOWS THE SECRET WHY. [crickets chirping] I'VE COME TO SEE WHOEVER'S IN CHARGE OF THIS PLACE. (Mister Creed) WHAT? A LIE! GO FETCH HIM, SON. (Mister Creed) THIS IS A MOCKERY. [child crying] (child) NO. [thudding] [child crying] (child) NO, NO, NO. JUBAL! YOU'RE INTRUDING, SIR. IF YOU'LL BE GOOD ENOUGH TO STEP OUT-- THAT'S YOUR LAST WHACK. [bell ringing] JEREMY, ESCORT MASTER BANCROFT DOWNSTAIRS WHERE HE MAY REFLECT ON THE ERROR OF HIS WAYS. "I MUST BE THEIR SCOURGE AND MINISTER," AS SHAKESPEARE SAID, "CRUEL ONLY TO BE KIND." THAT DON'T MAKE SENSE. TODAY'S UNRULY AND DISRESPECTFUL BOY, IF NOT PUT STRAIGHT, BECOMES TOMORROW'S MISCREANT. AND SOON WE'LL HAVE SPAWNED A GENERATION OF CROOKS, BRAGGARTS-- I'M THE UNCLE OF JUBAL WINTER AND I'VE COME FOR HIM. JUBAL WINTER, YOU SAY. OUR NEWEST. I REGRET TO SAY THE LAD'S MAKING A PAINFUL ADJUSTMENT. I WAS AFRAID OF THAT. NOW YOU GET HIM, AND WE'LL BE ON OUR WAY. AH, IF ONLY IT WERE THAT EASY. I'M HIS NEAREST LIVING RELATIVE AND I WANT HIM. NOW WHERE'S THE KNOT IN THAT ROPE? THE CHILD'S BEEN PLACED IN MY CUSTODY. I CAN'T JUST TURN HIM OVER TO YOU WITHOUT OBSERVING THE LEGAL NICETIES. YOU MEAN SEE A JUDGE? AFTER ALL, WE MUST BE SATISFIED YOU'RE A FIT GUARDIAN. BY THE WAY, WHAT'S YOUR TRADE OR CALLING? I'M A HORSE TRADER. OH, DEAR, DEAR. I'VE HEARD THAT ATTITUDE BEFORE. BUT I AIN'T NEVER BEEN CRUEL ONLY TO BE KIND TO MY ANIMALS. AND I WON'T EVER BE TO THAT BOY! BESIDES, IT DON'T CHANGE THE FACTS, WHICH IS KITH BELONGS WITH KIN. NEVERTHELESS, THERE'S NOTHING TO BE DONE TONIGHT. NOW I SUGGEST YOU COME BY TOMORROW-- NOT HARDLY. SEE HERE! I MUST WARN YOU, I'M A PUBLIC SERVANT. WHERE'VE YOU GOT HIM? UNDER LOCK AND KEY! TODAY THE IMPENITENT LITTLE SNIPJACK TRIED TO RUN AWAY! WELL, TONIGHT HE'S GONNA MAKE IT! NO! NO! UNHAND ME! HELP! TAKE ME TO JUBAL. I'LL HAVE THE LAW ON YOU! HELP! COME BACK. COME OVER HERE. GET ME DOWN! COME HERE! (Mister Creed) COME BACK HERE! AIN'T YOU GOT NOTHING TO SAY TO YOUR UNCLE BANJO? YOU WANNA SEE MY RAT BITES? (Jubal) THIS IS THE HOUSE WHERE MOM AND ME USED TO LIVE. DON'T LOOK LIKE ANYBODY'S MOVED IN. (Banjo) THEN THIS AIN'T BURGLARY, STRICTLY SPEAKING. (Jubal) PUSH ME THROUGH. (Banjo) EASY DOES IT. (Jubal) I'LL ONLY BE A MINUTE. [thunder rumbling] SEE? I KNEW THEY WOULDN'T FIND THIS WHEN THEY CAME AND TOOK MOMMA'S FURNITURE AWAY. IT'S MY "POSSIBLES" BAG. I GOT THE IDEA FROM YOURS. WELL, THE IMPORTANT THING IS YOU GOT THEM PAPERS I GAVE YOU ALONG WITH DIDO'S LAMENT? SURE, HERE. AND MY GOLD NUGGET, AND MY GENUINE EAGLE CLAW THAT YOU GAVE ME TO PROTECT ME FROM BAD MEDICINE. WELL, YOU GOT ANYTHING USEFUL LIKE A CLEAN SHIRT? NO. BUT THERE'S THIS THAT'S MINE... BECAUSE IT BELONGED TO DADDY. [thunder rumbling] GUESS NOBODY WANTED MOMMA'S... WEATHER'S CHANGING. IT'S CLOUDING UP TO RAIN. I TAKE THAT TO MEAN GOD IS FEELING SORRY, TOO. CRYING FOR CATHERINE LIKE ME AND YOU WOULD, IF IT WAS MANLY. I AIN'T CRYING. NOBODY SAID YOU WAS. COME ON, LET'S GO. GOING WHERE? TO GET YOUR MARE BACK BEFORE SHE DROPS THAT FOAL SHE'S CARRYING. GOT YOU A RIDING OUTFIT. NOW SEE IF THIS FITS. YOU HANDLE THAT TOOL LIKE YOU DONE BLACKSMITHING BEFORE. AIN'T NOTHING MUCH ABOUT HORSES I CAN'T HANDLE. SMITHING AND DOCTORING, BREAKING FOR SADDLE OR HARNESS. THE THING I DO BEST IS TRADE. DOWNRIGHT SHAME. YOU HAVEN'T SEEN A FRIEND OF MINE PASS BY HERE, HAVE YOU? ICHABOD THE TINKER? YESTERDAY MORNING. HEADING FOR THE PLUMAS HORSE FAIR OVER AT CASCADE. YOU'RE THE SECOND TO ASK THAT. YEAH? WHO'S THE FIRST? THE SAM IVORY. (Banjo) YOU GOTTA LEARN ALL THERE IS TO KNOW ABOUT YOUR ANIMALS. WHAT'S THAT? TAKE SOLOMON AND SHEBA HERE. THE FINEST SET OF WHEEL TEAM. WHY DO YOU GIVE THEM ALL NAMES? 'CAUSE A NAME HELPS YOU KEEP IN MIND THAT HORSES GOT JUST AS MUCH DIFFERENCE IN TEMPERAMENT AS PEOPLE. SOME OF THEM SWEET AND KINDLY LIKE OLD SOLOMON HERE. AND THEN YOU GOT SOME MEAN BUGGERS. WHOA, THERE, CHOCTAW. SETTLE HIM DOWN AND I'M GONNA SELL HIM TO CALVIN BOST. HE'S THE MAYOR OVER IN SONOMA. HE'S ALWAYS LOOKING FOR A SHOWY ANIMAL TO RIDE IN PARADES. YUP, FROM NOW ON YOUR LIFE'LL BE TALL GRASS FROM ONE FOURTH OF JULY TO THE OTHER. WON'T IT, OLD BOY? WHAT'S THIS ONE'S NAME? THAT'S SHOESTRING. HE'S SORTA GOTCH-EARED. YEAH, FULL OF TICKS WHEN I TOOK HIM IN, IN A TRADE. STILL A JIM-DANDY POSSE HORSE. WHAT'S A POSSE HORSE? FOR CHASING OUTLAWS. HE'LL RUN ALL DAY AND ALL NIGHT AND FRY YOUR BACON THE NEXT MORNING. THIS IS LADY BUG. ABOUT THE FINEST LITTLE SADDLE MARE I THINK I EVER SEEN. CAN I RIDE HER TOMORROW? NO, I DON'T THINK SO. FETCH ME A HANDFUL OF SALT, WILL YOU? WELL, WHY CAN'T I RIDE HER? THESE AIN'T PLEASURE PETS, BOY, THEY'RE MERCHANDISE. SAME AS A TIN OF PEACHES ON A GROCER'S SHELF. EXCEPTING THEY TAKE A LOT MORE LOOKING AFTER. NOW THAT'S A KEEN OBSERVATION. THE SALT! UNCLE BANJO? HUH? THINK WE COULD GO AND LIVE WITH THE CHEYENNE INDIANS LIKE YOU DID WHEN YOU RAN AWAY FROM HOME? WE WOULDN'T BE WELCOME AT THEIR CAMPFIRES. WHY NOT? THEY SING A SONG THAT GOES: "TAKE AWAY THE WHITE MAN SEND BACK THE BUFFALO" OH. [animal howling] WHERE WILL WE GO AND LIVE? JUBAL? HMM? YOU KNOW, YOU'RE A WINTER, NOT A HACKETT. IT MIGHT BE THAT YOUR DADDY'S FOLKS MIGHT HAVE FIRST CLAIM ON YOU AND WANT YOU TO COME LIVE WITH THEM. NO. MY DADDY WAS AN ORPHAN, TOO. OH. SO I GUESS IT'S JUST YOU AND ME. ROLL OVER AND GO TO SLEEP. WE'RE LEAVING FOR WATERLOO FIRST THING IN THE MORNING. AND STOP SCRATCHING THEM RAT BITES. [horse neighs] (Elmore) STOP SHORT OF THAT GUN, FRIEND. THE BEST OF GOOD EVENING'S TO YOU, HORSE TRADER. HOW ABOUT DOING SOME BUSINESS? THE STORE'S CLOSED.

EXCEPT IF I WAS YOU, I'D USE ME A RUNNING IRON ON THEM BRANDS. WELL, THAT'S THOUGHTFUL OF YOU. NOBODY CAN SAY US MINTO BROTHERS GOT A MEAN BONE. WE'RE JUST LAWLESS COUNTRY BOYS. FUN-LOVING AND FULL OF GINGER. [laughs] YOU KNOW, I ALWAYS WANTED ME AN INDIAN PAINT PONY. CAREFUL, ELMORE! COME HERE, SUGAR. HIS NAME IS CHOCTAW. WATCH IT! HE'S A MEAN BOOGER. [horse neighing] COME ON, LUKE. YOU DRIVE A HARD BARGAIN.

UNCLE BANJO? YOU DON'T PAY THEM NO MIND. THERE'S THAT SORT IN EVERY TOWN. NOW WHAT WAS THAT YOU WAS ASKING? WHO WON THE TINKER'S MARE? WHO GIVES A TINKER'S DAMN? I THINK THEY WANT TO FIGHT. DRINK YOUR MILK AND PAY THEM NO ATTENTION. IT'S MERELY THE BRAYING OF BALAAM'S ASS. WHAT DID YOU CALL US? UNCLE BANJO, I THINK THEY'RE GONNA MAKE YOU FIGHT. [horse neighing] IT USED TO BE I HAD A SHORT FUSE AND WAS EASILY PROVOKED. BUT THAT WAS BEFORE I LEARNED FORBEARANCE IS THE MANLIEST VIRTUE. I'M GONNA WRITE THAT DOWN. 'COURSE, NOBODY BUT A FOOL WOULD MISTAKE THAT FOR COWARDICE. YOU CALLING ME AND VIRGIL FOOLS? WE THINK YOU'RE NOTHING BUT A MULEY COW WEARING BOOTS. WELL, PUT IT ANOTHER WAY.

YOU'RE GONNA REALLY LIKE MOLLIE. SHE'S AS TRUE AS WILLIAM TELL'S ARROW. I DON'T FEEL VERY GOOD. YEAH, YOU'LL FEEL A LOT BETTER WITH A PLATE OF HOT SUPPER IN YOU. LOOK WHO'S JUST IN TIME TO HELP WITH THE MILKING. MOLLIE, MEET JUBAL. JUBAL, IT'S MY PLEASURE. AIN'T SHE A CRACKERJACK? SHE DON'T ASK WOMAN QUESTIONS LIKE WHAT, HOW COME, WHEN. THAT'S A MIGHTY CLAMMY HAND. [birds chirping] PRUNE WHIP. WHAT'D YOU SAY? SPEAK UP. HE SAID "PRUNE WHIP." PRUNE WHIP? WHERE'D YOU GET ANY PRUNE WHIP? LADY JANE GREY. [cow mooing] IS THAT WHAT YOU BEEN TRYIN' TO TELL ME, THAT YOU HAD TOO MUCH PRUNE WHIP? NOD, IF IT'S TOO MUCH PRUNE WHIP. (Banjo) TOO MUCH PRUNE WHIP. AHA, WHAT HE NEEDS IS SOME JALAP AND ROOT POWDER. BANJO, HE DOESN'T NEED ONE OF YOUR INDIAN REMEDIES. HE NEEDS YOU TO HOLD HIS HEAD. BOY LIKES YOU ALREADY. (Mollie) WHY NOT? WE'VE BEEN THROUGH THE WARS TOGETHER. [chuckling] YOU KNOW, MOLLIE, I'M UP A BOX CANYON. IT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME. [laughs] I'M SORRY. YOU'VE SUDDENLY GOT A CHILD ON YOUR HANDS AND YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT'S NEXT. THAT'S RIGHT. AND WHAT AM I GONNA DO WITH HIM? DO WHAT ANY FATHER WOULD. MOLLIE, YOU KNOW ME. I KNOW. YOU'RE NOT PERFECT. WHO IS? MOLLIE, WHAT THE BOY NEEDS IS A PROPER BRINGIN' UP. (Banjo) YOU KNOW, CLEAN LAUNDRY, REGULAR HABITS-- THAT'S IMPORTANT, BUT NOT MOST IMPORTANT. SQUARE VALUES, THAT'S WHAT HE NEEDS, SQUARE VALUES. WELL, MAYBE YOU'LL HAVE TO SET HIM AN EXAMPLE. IT'S A LITTLE LATE FOR ME TO CHANGE. OH. YOU MAY BE SURPRISED. LOVE DOES WORK MIRACLES. MOLLIE, I'D LIKE TO DO RIGHT BY THE BOY, BUT NOT AT THE PRICE OF LOSING MY FREEDOM. ENJOY YOURSELF. OH, COME ON. NOW, DON'T BE LIKE THAT. LIKE WHAT? YOU KNOW. SWEET PLUMS IN YOUR MOUTH AND CHOKEBERRIES IN YOUR HEART. LOOK, I KNOW I'M SELFISH. THAT'S JUST THE WAY I AM. [laughing] HERE'S THIS FRIEND OF MINE, OH-CUM-GACHE, HE'S THE CHIEF SHAMAN OF THE CHEYENNE INDIANS. OH, NOT HIM AGAIN. OH-CUM-GACHE TOLD ME, HE SAID, "WHEN GREAT SPIRIT PREPARES A FEAST, "MAN SHOULD GORGE HIMSELF ON ROAST BUFFALO." [grunts] I THINK GOD HAS DIFFERENT IDEAS FOR YOU. HMM. AND THE ENTRAILS AND THE RIBS... I THINK HE MEANS FOR JUBAL TO TEACH YOU SQUARE VALUES. CLEAN DOWN TO THE BONE. AND REGULAR HABITS. AND SUCKS OUT THE MARROW. BANJO, STOP IT. [sighs] AND WHEN HE'S FINISHED, HE LICKS HIS FINGERS CLEAN. BANJO, WOULD YOU STOP IT? I WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU PLAN TO DO ABOUT JUBAL'S FUTURE. PUT IT OFF TILL MORNIN'. [giggling] (Jubal) UNCLE BANJO? UNCLE BANJO? GO BACK TO SLEEP. UNCLE BANJO? HE'S THIRSTY OR SOMETHING. WELL, GO FIND OUT. YOU'RE THIRSTY OR SOMETHING? WHY DO PEOPLE CALL YOU BANJO, IF YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO PLAY ONE? WELL, IT'S SHORT FOR BENJAMIN JOSEPH. SHUT THOSE EYES. I LOVE YOU. I DO. 'COURSE YOU DO. MEN DON'T SPEAK OUT THEIR FEELINGS. WHY? WELL, IT JUST AIN'T SEEMLY.

I THOUGHT THAT WAS PAYMENT FOR ME SAVIN' YOUR LIFE. WELL, WHATEVER. THE POINT IS, THAT STALLION'S BLOOD GOES CLEAR BACK TO THE DARLEY ARABIAN. WHAT'S ALL THAT BREEDIN' COME TO? ONE FOAL. ONE TO CARRY ON THE LINE. AND I MEAN TO HAVE IT. IS THAT WHY YOU GOT SAM IVORY ON THE MARE'S TRAIL? STOMPIN' EVERYBODY IN HIS WAY? SAM TAKES CARE TO STAY JUST INSIDE THE LAW. I'M SORRY, TIP, BUT I GAVE THAT MARE TO MY NEPHEW, AND I'M GONNA GET HER BACK FOR HIM. WELL, FINE, FINE. HE CAN HAVE THE MARE, JUST SO YOU SELL ME THE FOAL. NAH, FROM THE BEGINNING, I MEANT FOR HIM TO HAVE THAT COLT TO GROW UP WITH. BUT THINGS HAVE CHANGED. HE'S AN ORPHAN. THINK WHAT MY MONEY CAN BRING HIM. SCHOOLIN', POSITION, THE START IN LIFE YOU AND ME NEVER HAD. THAT THERE'S THE EAGLE FEATHER. $10,000 IF YOU BRING BACK THAT MARE. WELL, SAM, WAS I TALKING LOUD ENOUGH OR DO I HAVE TO REPEAT MYSELF? OUR DEAL WAS FOR $5,000. ONLY $5,000? (Conaker) WELL, YOU AIN'T NO ORPHAN. NOW I SUGGEST YOU BOTH GET ON THAT MEDICINE MAN'S TRAIL, 'CAUSE THE FIRST ONE WHO BRINGS ME THAT MARE-- NOW HOLD ON, CONACHER. ...COLLECTS THE JACKPOT! YOU AIN'T CUTTING ANYBODY ELSE IN ON MY DEAL. WHAT'S WRONG WITH A LITTLE HEALTHY COMPETITION? IT'S WHAT MAKES AMERICA PROSPER. MONEY CALLS THE TUNE, HUH? [exhales] 'COURSE, THERE'S NO LAW THAT SAYS THE COMPETITION HAS TO STAY HEALTHY. JUST ONE THING. I WANT THAT MARE BEFORE SHE FOALS, OTHERWISE, THERE AIN'T NO DEAL. WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE? HE'S AFRAID SOMEBODY MIGHT TRY KEEPING THE REAL COLT AND FOBBIN' OFF A RINGER. A SHREWD TRADER MIGHT. WELL, GENTLEMEN. HOO, YOU REALLY CUT THE WOLF LOOSE. [laughing] DIDO ISN'T ANYWHERE IN TOWN. COME ON, WHY NOT TRY YOUR LUCK WITH THE RIFLES? AND THEN LATER WE'LL CHECK ABOUT DR. SWAYNE, THIS MEDICINE MAN. [gun firing] [gun cocking] [gunshot] IT'S IN THE HEART THAT COUNTS. [gun cocking] [gunshot] SEEN YOUR MARE AROUND, [gunshot] POOR LITTLE ORPHAN BOY? AND WHAT'S IT TO YOU, MISTER? [gunshots] I ASKED YOU A QUESTION. IF I HAD, I WOULDN'T TELL YOU. ARE YOU TRYING TO FRIGHTEN US? TAKE THIS FOR GOSPEL, KID, I MEAN TO HAVE THAT COLT. [gunshot] COME ON, JUBAL. NOW WOMEN AND CHILDREN HAVE NOTHING TO FEAR FROM SAMUEL IVORY. ON THE OTHER HAND, I HAVE NO SUCH COMPASSION FOR COYOTES, CONVICTS, AND HORSE TRADERS. [gun firing] [crowd cheering] ELMORE, I AIN'T SURE THIS IS THE SMARTEST THING WE EVER DONE. OH, WITH ALL THAT'S GOIN' ON NOBODY'S GONNA NOTICE A LITTLE MORE WHEN WE ROB THE MERCHANTS BANK. [horses neighing] IF I'D HAD ANY SENSE, I'D HAVE GONE PLEASURE FISHING UNTIL AFTER THIS FOOLISHNESS WAS OVER. WHAT'D YOU FIND OUT? NOTHING, ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. NONE OF THEM MEDICINE MEN EVER HEARD OF A DR. JETHRO SWAYNE. NOW, DON'T THAT STRIKE YOU AS KIND OF PECULIAR? HACKETT, YOU'RE IN THE NEXT HEAT. NOW WHEEL 'EM UP TO THE LINE. HEY, WILEY, ARE YOU SURE YOU DON'T WANT TO BUY THIS TEAM RIGHT NOW? 'CAUSE AFTER THEY WIN THE PRICE GOES UP. IT'LL COME DOWN AGAIN JUST LIKE THE OLD MAID'S HOPES. NUMBER 10. WHO'S NEXT? NUMBER 10. THESE BELGIANS DO START KIND OF SLOW BUT FINISH FAST, SO I RECKON A DOLLAR BET ON THEM WILL COME BACK LIKE BREAD ON THE WATER. I BELIEVE I'LL JUST GET A BET. (Banjo) COME ON, SOLOMON! HA! HOA! WHAT'S THE ODDS, RUDOLPH? EVEN. NUMBER 9 FOR $1. (Rudolph) YOU'VE GOT IT. THERE'S OCHINEE. HOWDY, OCHINEE. OH, JUBAL. (Jubal) OCHINEE MEANS "ONE EYE" IN THE CHEYENNE TONGUE. ME AND UNCLE BANJO ARE THE ONLY ONES IN THE WHOLE WORLD THAT CALL HIM THAT INSTEAD OF JACK O'SPADES. OCHINEE'S AN IMPROVEMENT. THE NAME HE WAS BORN WITH IS ALBERT T. MUSGROVE. [laughing] YOU ARE BANJO'S NEPHEW. HOWDY, SHERIFF TADLOCK. HOWDY, JUBAL. HOWDY, SHERIFF. THERE'S THE MINTO BROTHERS. HOWDY, LUKE. HOWDY, ELMORE. HOWDY, LUKE. HOWDY, ELMORE. ALL RIGHT, HOIST THEM PAWS, ELMORE. I'M LUKE, HE'S ELMORE. WELL, THESE BARRELS ARE LAW AND ORDER, AND THEY'RE PUTTING YOU UNDER ARREST FOR STAGECOACH ROBBERY AND ANY OTHER FELONIES THAT MAY COME TO LIGHT. [gun firing] [cheering] [horses neighing] COME ON, HOA! UP THERE. HIYA! GO, BANJO! HIYA! [crowd cheering] COME ON, BANJO! GIDDY-UP, BANJO! (man) COME ON, BANJO! GO! GO! [yelling] HIYA! [crowd cheering] LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, YOU'RE LOOKIN' AT THE FINEST CHAMPION BELGIAN TEAM ON THE MARKET TODAY. AND I WILL NOT LET THESE SPECIAL ANIMALS GO FOR ONE PENNY LESS THAN $300, AMERICAN CASH! [crowd cheering] HOW'S THIS FOR A DANDY SPREAD? OWNIN' THIS RESTAURANT SURE BEATS WORKING ON THE CENTRAL PACIFIC, DON'T IT? WHAT'S IN THIS STUFF? THAT'S THE ONE QUESTION YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO ASK. JUST PITCH IN. AND IF YOU CAN SWING A HEALTHY BELCH AFTERWARDS, YOU'LL SEE A MIGHTY HAPPY COOK BACK IN THE KITCHEN. PASS ME THE BUG JUICE. [dog barking] THERE HE IS AGAIN. I'D FIGURED HIM FOR A PICKY EATER. YOU'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT HIM. HE SCARES JUBAL. NO, HE DON'T. WHAT I WANT TO KNOW IS WHY DOES HE KEEP BIRD-DOGGING US INSTEAD OF LOOKING FOR DIDO HIMSELF? MAYBE IT'S BECAUSE YOU KNOW YOUR MARE BY SIGHT AND HE DON'T. WHICH PUTS AN IDEA IN MY HEAD. MOLLIE'S READY. GET OUT THERE AND DO YOUR STUFF. (Jubal) UNCLE BANJO! UNCLE BANJO! UNCLE BANJO! UNCLE BANJO! WHAT'S YOUR HURRY, MISTER? I'VE GOT TO TELL UNCLE BANJO. DON'T YOU KNOW BETTER THAN TO INTERRUPT HIM WHEN HE'S TRYING TO CLINCH A SALE? (Jubal) BUT I SAW DIDO'S LAMENT. I KNOW IT WAS MY HORSE. I SAW THIS FELLA SNEAKIN' HIM INTO THE ACE HIGH LIVERY BARN. WHERE'D YOU SAY? (Jubal) THE ACE HIGH LIVERY BARN. SHHH. [laughing] (Jubal) UNCLE BANJO! KEEP YOUR VOICE DOWN. I GOT ME A LADY HERE WHO'S NOT GOING TO BE IN A FAMILY WAY MUCH LONGER. YEAH, I WANT HER. HOW MUCH? NOT NOW. NOT NOW, MISTER. COME ON, $100. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT YOU DO. YOU COME BACK AFTER THE FOAL GETS HERE, AND I'LL BE ABLE TO DICKER WITH YOU. YOU TAKE IT OR YOU LEAVE IT. ALL RIGHT, MISTER. ANYTHING YOU SAY SHE'S WORTH. YOUR LIFE. WILL YOU QUIT STALLING AND SHOW ME THIS GREAT POSSE HORSE? JUST WHETTIN' YOUR APPETITE. I KNOW. FOR THAT BACON HE'S SUPPOSED TO FRY ME. I--I BEEN TRYING TO TRAIN HIM TO BREW YOUR COFFEE, TOO, BUT HE AIN'T MASTERED THAT YET. HELP, HORSE THIEF! SOMEBODY HELP! [gun firing] [horse neighing] ALL RIGHT, HANDS UP! IT'S A TRICK! YOU SNOOKERED ME. WHAT HAPPENED? I WOULDN'T SELL HIM THAT HORSE, SHERIFF. HE STOLE IT FROM ME, AND YOU CAUGHT HIM RED-HANDED. HACKETT! ALL RIGHT, THAT AIN'T HELPING YOUR CASE ANY. LET'S GO. [laughing] MR. CONACHER-- ALL'S FAIR, IVORY. [laughing] THAT'S THE FIRST RULE OF THE GAME! IT WORKED LIKE AN OLD OWL-CLAW CHARM, DIDN'T IT? THANKS TO TEAMWORK. YOU KNOW TRULY, A MAN'S GREATEST RICHES ARE HIS FRIENDS. WELL, YOU'RE GONNA NEED ALL YOU GOT WHEN SAM IVORY GETS OUT OF JAIL A-SNORTIN' FIRE. SHOOT, BY THAT TIME WE'LL HAVE DIDO'S LAMENT AND BE LONG GONE. WELL, YOU SURE GOT IN THE FIRST LICK! WHAT'S YOUR NEXT MOVE? WELL, THAT'S FOR ME TO KNOW. COME ON, LIJAH, LET'S TAKE A WALK. HE'S IN A BIT OF A HUMOR. (Lijah) WHAT'S SO PECULIAR ABOUT THEM OTHER MEDICINE MEN NEVER HEARING OF YOUR JETHRO SWAYNE? ME, I KNOW EVERY HORSE TRADER FROM TURKEY HILL TO SILVERADO. COULD BE THEY WERE LYING TO PROTECT ONE OF THEIR OWN. MEDICINE MEN AIN'T THAT TIGHT. NO MORE THAN LIKELY HE'S ONE OF THEM QUACKS THAT CHANGES HIS NAME AS OFTEN AS HIS SOCKS. AND IF THAT'S THE CASE-- IF THAT'S THE CASE, HE COULD BE HERE IN TOWN RIGHT NOW. COME TO THINK, I ONCE BOUGHT A NOSTRUM CALLED SWAYNE'S STOMACH BITTERS AND DROPSY CURE. BANJO, YOU AIN'T NEVER GONNA LEARN TO STOP THROWIN' YOUR MONEY AWAY. IT WAS YOUR CHRISTMAS PRESENT. [dog barking] [people chattering] PROFESSOR? YOU'RE IN THE WRONG TENT. I AM NOT PROFESSOR KILMER THE ELECTRICAL BELT CHARLATAN. I HAPPEN TO BE COLONEL NOAH, UH-- BIGELOW. YES, YES, YOUR SUDDEN APPEARANCE THREW ME INTO CONFUSION. DR. MUNYON'S VERMIFUGE. THE PRODUCT OF AN EX-COLLEAGUE. DON'T BEING COLLEAGUES MAKE YOU A DOCTOR? SEE, I WAS LOOKIN' FOR ONE TO GIVE ME A PRESCRIPTION FOR TONIC. I GOT A QUEASY STOMACH. SIR, ALL MODESTY ASIDE, I DO HAPPEN TO BE A PRACTITIONER OF THE HEALING ARTS. A--A HUMBLE DISCIPLE OF AESCULAPIUS, AS IT WERE. AND PERCHANCE, SIR, I HAPPEN TO HAVE JUST ONE TRIAL BOTTLE OF, UH, SACHEM'S ANODYNE SYRUP, WHICH FOR THE MODEST PRICE OF-- NO, NO. THAT'S TOO SWEET. I'M LOOKING FOR SOMETHING LIKE, UH, STOMACH BITTERS. SORRY, NOT IN MY LINE. HOW ABOUT A DROPSY CURE? [glass shattering] BUTTERFINGERS. YOU KNOW, IT'S FUNNY. A FELLOW WHO LOOKED JUST LIKE YOU SOLD ME OSGOOD'S EXPECTORANT. OR WAS IT DR. SWAYNE'S STOMACH BITTERS? YOU GET OUT OF HERE. EXCEPT, HE WASN'T SPORTIN' A BEARD. WHAT DO YOU WANT? DR. JETHRO SWAYNE. D-DR. JETH-- OH, MY HEART, MY HEART. MY HEART! OH, MY PILLS, MY PILLS. PLEASE, PLEASE. MY PILLS. [guns fires] HELP, HELP, PLEASE! NOW I WANT TO KNOW WHAT YOU'VE DONE WITH THAT LIGHT BAY MARE YOU WON OFF THE TINKER. NOTHING, NOTHING. I PROMISE YOU, NOTHING! PLEASE, PLEASE, DON'T HURT ME. I WANNA KNOW WHAT YOU'VE DONE WITH HER. NOTHING, I... I SOLD THE HORSE. COULD I HELP IT IF THAT FOOL WOMAN OFFERED ME A TIDY PROFIT? WHAT FOOL WOMAN? [gasping] FLORA F-FOLSOM. THANK YOU. IT'S DIDO. WE'VE FOUND HER. GETTING' HER BACK'S GONNA BE THE PROBLEM, BECAUSE DEALIN' WITH A WIDOW LADY CALLS FOR NIMBLENESS. LUCKILY, THAT'S MY SPECIALTY. RUN ALONG, NOW, MY PRETTY. OFF TO THE BARN WITH YOU. BEG YOUR PARDON, MA'AM, WOULD YOU BE THE MISTRESS OF THE HOUSE? PUT IT ANOTHER WAY, DO I HAVE THE HONOR OF SPEAKIN' TO MISS FLORA FOLSOM DOBBS? MISSIS. I AM MISSIS TO THE LATE ABNER MERIVALE DOBBS. WELL, THAT'S A PITY. NO. WE MUST BE PHILOSOPHICAL. I GAVE ABNER THE HAPPIEST 4 AND A HALF MONTHS OF HIS LIFE, AND ABNER GAVE ME... BUT WHAT ARE WORLDLY GOODS? NOTHIN', COMPARED TO A GLAD HEART AND THE SMILE OF A CHILD. (Flora) AH, YES. A GLAD HEART. THOUGH I MUST CONFESS MINE, IN WIDOWHOOD, OFTEN NEEDS CHEERING. THAT'S ONLY HUMAN. PRAY, WHAT BRINGS YOU CALLING? LOVE FOR THE BOY. (Banjo) AND YOU HAVE IT IN YOUR POWER TO MEND HIS BROKEN DREAMS. (Flora) OH, MERCY. WHY DON'T WE TALK ABOUT THIS OUT OF THE SUN? AND YOU SAY THE CHILD'S PET WAS SOLD AT AUCTION? I WOULD HAVE RODE HER AWAY TO THE HILLS FIRST, ONLY THEY CLAPPED ME IN THE ORPHANAGE. AND HUNTIN' FOR HER HAS LED US TO YOUR DOORSTEP. OH. TRUE OR NOT, THAT STORY PLUCKS THE VERY HEARTSTRINGS. IT WOULD PLAY TO PACKED HOUSES IN ANY THEATER IN THE COUNTRY. YOU'LL DO BUSINESS? OH, ALAS, NO. THAT SPLENDIFEROUS ANIMAL PLAYS A VERY IMPORTANT ROLE IN MY FUTURE PLANS. (Banjo) JUBAL, GOD DON'T ALWAYS PROVIDE A HAPPY ENDIN'. NOW YOU BLOW YOUR NOSE AND DON'T CRY. [crying] NOW I'LL NEVER SEE DIDO AGAIN. NOW, NOW, NOW, NOW. NONE OF THAT. NONE OF THAT. NOW, COME ON. NOW YOU BUCK UP. TAKE IT LIKE A LITTLE SOLDIER. LITTLE BOY, WHY DON'T YOU RUN DOWN TO THE COOK AND ASK HIM FOR SOME OF MY DIVINITY FUDGE? BUT, UNCLE BANJO, YOU PROMISED! AND CHEW IT SLOWLY! [whispering] WHEN THEY SAY NO IS WHEN THE REAL TRADER BEGINS. YOU SAID YOU GOT FUTURE PLANS FOR THE BOY'S MARE? I DID? OH, YES. SHE'S PART OF MY TRIUMPHANT RETURN TO THE THEATER. I SHALL PLAY MAZEPPA IN PINK TIGHTS, RIDING A LIVE HORSE. [laughing] WHAT A CRACKERJACK OF AN IDEA. TURNIN' IT INTO A COMEDY. MAZEPPA IS HIGH DRAMA. WELL, NOT ASTRIDE A BROWN MARE. WHAT MAZEPPA RIDES IS A FIERY BLACK STALLION, NOTHIN' LESS. STALLIONS ARE FRACTIOUS. NOT EASILY KEPT IN HAND. WELL, SUPPOSIN' I COULD FIND YOU ONE THAT'S FIERY AND GENTLE BOTH. AND DARK AS THE DEVIL'S STOVEPIPE. WOULD YOU TRADE ME THE MARE? WELL, SHE'S HAVING THAT NUISANCE OF A BABY. I'D BE GIVING YOU 2 FOR 1, WOULDN'T I? OF COURSE. $50 A BOOT AND AN EXTRA BONUS, I'LL TRAIN THE STALLION FOR THE JOB. I THINK I'LL SLEEP ON IT. "BETTER STRIKE WHILE THE IRON'S HOT." THAT'S WHAT THE POET SAYS. PERHAPS, I COULD FORGET ABOUT THE DRAMA AND GO BACK TO SINGING ON MY BLUE VELVET TRAPEZE. ZWEIG'S OPERA HOUSE UP IN TILLAMOOK, OREGON? OH, WHAT A MEMORY YOU HAVE. ONCE SEEN, NEVER FORGOTTEN. [laughs] ♪ MY SWEETHEART'S THE MAN IN THE MOON ♪ ♪ I AM GOING TO MARRY HIM SOON ♪ ♪ IT WOULD GIVE ME SUCH BLISS ♪ ♪ JUST TO GIVE HIM ONE KISS ♪ ♪ BUT I KNOW THAT A DOZEN ♪ ♪ I NEVER WOULD MISS ♪ WHAT DO YOU SAY? THE STALLION FOR JUBAL'S MARE? YOU HAVE HONEST EYES. AS THE DAY IS LONG. BUT YOU DRIVE SUCH A HARD BARGAIN. PROFESSIONAL PRIDE. I BELIEVE WE CAN DO BUSINESS, BUT NOT WITH YOUR HAT ON. FETCH ME THE BOOTBLACK, IN THE TRUNK OVER THERE. THEN GET ME A NOSEBAG FULL OF OATS, AND WE'LL PUT A DOLLOP OF BAR WHISKEY IN IT. THAT'LL PUT FIRE IN HIS EYES. WHAT IF IT COMES OFF? (Banjo) IT WON'T. HOW DO YOU KNOW? SPIFFY'S RAIN RESISTANT BOOTBLACK. COST A FEW PENNIES MORE, BUT IT'S THE BEST ON THE MARKET. IT'LL COME OFF SOMETIME. YOU ARE QUIBBLESOME TONIGHT. HE'S A BRUTE. HE'S MAGNIFICENT! PRANCE, BLACK BEAUTY, PRANCE! NOW THAT'S WHAT YOU CALL PRIDE OF OWNERSHIP. WELL, UNDERNEATH, HE AIN'T PITCH BLACK. NONE OF GOD'S CREATURES IS. SHE REMEMBERS ME, SEE? OH, I BET YOU THOUGHT WE'D NEVER FIND YOU, BUT WE DID. WELL, SHE WON'T BE LONG. UNCLE BANJO. (Banjo) WELL, SHE'S ALMOST READY NOW. WE BETTER GET HER BACK TO THE ACE HIGH BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE. UNCLE BANJO! BANJO? YEAH, WILL. I'VE GOT A WARRANT HERE. GUESS WHOSE NAME'S ON IT? AND ANOTHER ONE FOR THE BOY. (Banjo) THIS IS ONE OF THE FINER JAILS, AS FAR AS JAILS GO. SOMEBODY CARED ENOUGH ABOUT ITS SMELL TO SCRUB IT DOWN WITH PINELYPTUS SANITARY COMPOUND. ONE OF 'EM, ELKO, WAS TOPS THOUGH FOR COMFORT AND HOT FOOD. YOU NEVER SET YOUR TOOTH IN KIDNEY PIE LIKE THE ONE THEY BRING OVER FROM THE NEW BOSTON CAFE. IT'S ON THE CORNER OF THIRD STREET AND LANDERS AVENUE. HEY, HORSE TRADER! DON'T YOUR WORD-BOX NEVER GET EMPTY? THERE'S LOW TYPES IN EVERY JAIL. YOU KNOW, I'M AWFUL HUNGRY. (Banjo) HOW CAN YOU STILL BE HUNGRY AFTER ALL THOSE HOT TAMALES YOU HAD FOR BREAKFAST? HEY, LAWMAN, YOU KNOW I'M HERE ON A FRAME-UP. WHEN ARE YOU GONNA TURN ME LOOSE? THAT'S UP TO A JUDGE AND JURY. ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO, BANJO, JUBAL, TOO. WHAT DID TIP CONACHER SAY WHEN YOU GAVE HIM MY MESSAGE? LET JUSTICE BE DONE. (Banjo) YOU KNOW, WILL, JUST A THOUGHT, BUT THE SHERIFF OVER IN WATERLOO MIGHT LIKE TO ASK OLD IVORY SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT THE MURDER OF ICHABOD THE TINKER. [dog barking] (Sheriff) READY WHEN YOU ARE, JUDGE. WELL, NOW, HACKETT, IT SEEMS YOU'VE GOT SOMETHIN' TO ANSWER FOR. IS THAT ALL THIS IS? JUDGE, LOOK IN STALL NUMBER 7 OVER AT THE ACE HIGH LIVERY FOR THAT SPECIAL LITTLE ITEM OF YOURS. NO, THAT'S NOT ALL THIS IS. THE COMPLAINT ON HAND CHARGES YOU WITH CHILD STEALIN'. WITH WHAT? THE COURT'S ALREADY HEARD SOME EYEBROW-RAISING TESTIMONY. AH, JUDGE, YOU'RE NOT GONNA GIVE JUBAL BACK TO THAT SCARECROW, ARE YOU? I HAVE THE LAW ON MY SIDE! WHY DON'T YOU 2 BOYS ARGUE IT OUT? I'LL BE LISTENING. WHILE YOU RECKON, JUDGE, I'VE GOT SOME THINGS TO DO. I'LL BE BACK LATER. THERE HE GOES. I SEE THE SHERIFF HEADED FOR THE TELEGRAPH OFFICE. HEY, UH, MR. IVORY. YOU REALLY KILL SOME TINKER? SHUT YOUR MOUTH, BOY. LUKE FORGETS HIS ETIQUETTE 'CAUSE HE NEVER HAD NONE. I WAS JUST THINKIN' HOW FUN IT'D BE IF US 3 WENT DOWN TO FOLSOM PRISON TOGETHER. WRONG! US 3 ARE GOING TO BUST OUT OF HERE... TONIGHT. I WOULD RESPECTFULLY REMIND YOUR HONOR THAT THE COURT HAS ALREADY DECLARED THE BOY AN ORPHAN AND PLACED HIM IN MY CUSTODY IN LOCO PARENTIS. 9 IN THE SIDE POCKET. (Banjo) THAT'S JUST A MOUTHFUL OF JIMSONWEED. NATURE'S FIRST LAW IS BLOOD BELONGS WITH BLOOD. AND JUBAL'S MINE. IT'S THAT SIMPLE. HE'S MINE AND YOU STOLE HIM. IT'S THAT CRIMINAL. HOMER, I THOUGHT A 5:00 GAME MEANT 5:00. JUDGE... YOUR HONOR! BE RIGHT WITH YOU, TIP, AS SOON AS I DISPENSE JUSTICE. YOUR HONOR, YOU'RE A KINDLY MAN WITH AN UPSTANDIN' CHARACTER. NOW, WHICH WOULD YOU RATHER SEE IN A GYPSY'S CRYSTAL BALL? THIS BOY GROWIN' UP TO MEASLY MANHOOD IN THAT PESTHOLE ORPHANAGE? (Mister Creed) WHAT? A LIE! A FOUL CANARD! OR WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE HIM IN GOOD CLOTHES, IN A GOOD SCHOOL, WITH SONS OF THE FINEST FAMILIES? (Mister Creed) HOW? YOU ARE NOTHING BUT AN ITINERANT HORSE TRADER OF LESS THAN SAVORY REPUTATION. WELL, IT'S POSSIBLE. THE DREAM OF EVERY AMERICAN BOY CAN COME TRUE, (Banjo) THANKS TO THAT MAN STANDIN' THERE IN HIS LONDON-MADE BOOTS, TIP CONACHER. YOU DIDN'T FIND THE HORSE. INDEED I DID AND SHE'S SAFE AND SOUND. WOULD YOU TELL THE JUDGE WHAT YOU PROMISED TO PAY FOR THAT LITTLE COLT? $10,000. NO! YOU CAN'T! YOU GAVE DIDO'S COLT TO ME. IT'S MINE TO GROW UP WITH. HE WOULDN'T DARE USE THAT TONE OF VOICE WITH ME. JUBAL, HORSES ARE MERCHANDISE, JUST LIKE-- WELL, MY COLT AIN'T TINNED PEACHES! PLEASE, YOU PROMISED! SIT DOWN, SON, I KNOW I PROMISED, BUT YOUR FUTURE'S MORE IMPORTANT THAN A PROMISE. AND THE PRICE TAG ON IT IS THAT COLT. SHAME ON THE LOT OF YOU. AND YOU MOST OF ALL, BANJO HACKETT! THERE'S OTHER COLTS. THAT'S NOT THE POINT. THE POINT IS, YOU'RE BETRAYING HIS TRUST. MOLLIE, SELLIN' THAT COLT CAN BUY HIM ADVANTAGES. ADVANTAGES? FOR GOD'S SAKE, BANJO, DON'T MAKE HIM JOIN THAT ARMY. WHAT HE NEEDS TO LEARN NOW ARE THE REAL VALUES IN LIFE, LIKE HONESTY AND KINDNESS AND JUSTICE. [knocking] (Conaker) YOU GOT A RUNAWAY BUGGY, HOMER. TIME TO GET THE REINS BACK IN HAND. OH, YES. THE ISSUE AT HAND IS WHAT'S BEST FOR THE BOY. GROWIN' UP IN AN ORPHANAGE, OR ROAMIN' OVER CREATION WITH HACKETT, OR ATTENDING SOME FANCY BOARDING SCHOOL. IT'S THE DECISION OF THIS COURT... NUMBER 3. EVERY BOY'S DREAM COME TRUE: BOARDING SCHOOL! [laughing] WORTHY OF SOLOMON. THEREFORE, HACKETT, THE CHARGES AGAINST YOU ARE DISMISSED, ON YOUR PROMISE TO CONDUCT YOUR HORSE TRADIN' IN A REASONABLE MANNER, AND I THINK YOU'RE SHREWD ENOUGH TO KNOW WHAT I MEAN BY THAT. ANYTHING YOU SAY, JUDGE. THIS IS A MOCKERY! AS FOR YOU, YOUR PETITION FOR CUSTODY OF JUBAL WINTER IS DENIED. AND YOU ARE FINED, UH, $75, COURT COSTS. THAT'S THE RIGHT FIGURE. YOU, SIR, HAVEN'T HEARD THE LAST OF SILAS CREED. THIS COURT'S ADJOURNED. NOW, HACKETT, YOU GO AND GET ME MY BLIND HORSE. COME ON. I AIN'T GOIN' NOWHERE WITH YOU. JUBAL, THE WORLD DON'T ALWAYS MARCH TO YOUR TUNE. JUBAL, COME ON HOME WITH ME. AND YOU COME, TOO, AFTER YOU'VE DONE SOME THINKING. JUST LET ME KNOW WHEN AND WHERE THE MARE'S DUE. I'LL HAVE A BANK DRAFT IN MY POCKET. HOMER? MISTER, WHEN I GROW UP, I'M GONNA ROB YOUR TRAINS. HOMER, CALL. (Elmore) I CAN'T STAND MY SINNIN' NO MORE! (Luke) NO! NO, ELMORE! DON'T DO IT! (Ivory) DEPUTY! DEPUTY! COME QUICK. (Elmore) OH, HEAR ME, SWEET JESUS. THE BLACK SHEEP IS COMING HOME TO THE FOLD. (Luke) HURRY UP, DEPUTY! CUT HIM DOWN, CUT HIM DOWN! [grunts] [crickets chirping] IT'LL BE BEFORE MORNING. (Lijah) WHAT ABOUT TIP CONACHER? [horse neighing] WILL YOU FETCH HIM OUT HERE FOR ME? YOU'RE BOUND AND DETERMINED TO SELL HIM THAT COLT, AIN'T YA? IT'S FOR THE GOOD OF THE BOY. YEAH, YOU JUST KEEP SAYING IT AND MAYBE IT'LL BE TRUE. IS THAT HOW YOUR THINKIN' GOES? I DESPAIR FOR THE BOTH OF YOU. TELL MOLLIE TO SEND JUBAL OUT HERE. WHY DON'T YOU TELL HER YOURSELF? HAVE YOU SAID YOUR PRAYERS? YOU SOUND LIKE MISTER CREED. HEY, AREN'T YOU SUPPOSED TO RATTLE BEFORE YOU BITE? YOU'RE GONNA GO TO SLEEP LIKE THAT? MAYBE YOU WERE THINKING THAT YOU'D GO OUT AND HELP YOUR UNCLE BANJO? NO! HONEY, LISTEN, YOUR UNCLE'S GOT HIS FAULTS, LORD KNOWS, BUT YOU HAVE TO LEARN TO BALANCE THEM OFF AGAINST HIS GOOD POINTS. HE'S HONEST, IN HIS OWN WAY. HE'S NOT AFRAID TO STAND UP FOR WHAT HE THINKS IS RIGHT, AND HE KNOWS HOW TO ENJOY THE SIMPLE PLEASURES OF JUST BEING ALIVE. WELL, HE'S NOTHIN' BUT A 2-BIT, SLICKERIN' BACHELOR HORSE TRADER. WELL, I'LL GIVE YOU BACHELOR. IF YOU THINK HE'S SO PERFECT, WHY DON'T YOU MARRY HIM? BECAUSE-- HOW'S DIDO GETTING ALONG? WON'T BE LONG. THE BOY? I'D LEAVE HIM ALONE. I DON'T THINK SO. MOLLIE, I WANT HIM TO BE THERE WHEN THE COLT'S BORN. (Mollie) HE'LL BE THERE IF HE WANTS TO BE THERE. HE'S COMIN' NOW. COME WITH ME. (Jubal) OH, GO AHEAD. SLING ME AROUND. I WON'T BE NOTHIN' BUT DEAD WEIGHT, 'CAUSE I DON'T CARE! BAKE A CAKE, OR OTHERWISE KEEP YOURSELF BUSY. BAKE A CAKE? [cat meowing] [door opening] THEY TOLD ME OVER AT THE DEPOT THAT YOU WAS WAITING FOR ME. WELL, YEAH. JUST THOUGHT I'D, UH, TEST THE SEAT. WELL, IT'S JUST AS PERFECT AS AN EXPERT CAN MAKE IT. SAY, HOW'D YOU GET IN HERE ANYHOW? JUST SAID, "OPEN SESAME." [laughs] JUST WHERE IS IT YOU SAID BANJO'S HOLDING THAT MARE OF MINE? OUT AT MOLLIE'S DAIRY. YOU'D BETTER GET OFF OF THAT THING BEFORE YOU RUIN-- THEY HAD ME COVERED. NOW YOU GOT WHAT YOU WANTED. DON'T POINT THOSE THINGS IN MY DIRECTION. ME, I WANT THIS. [groaning] (Conaker) IVORY, ARE YOU GOING TO LET THEM GET-- SHUT UP, RICH MAN! THERE'S SOMETHING I GOT TO SAY TO YOU, CONACHER. IT'S YOUR FAULT, YOURS AND HACKETT'S, I'M IN HANGING TROUBLE. NOW, BEFORE I CUT OUT FOR MEXICO, I'M GOING TO SQUARE ACCOUNTS. YOU LISTENING? I AM GOING TO GET THAT PRECIOUS COLT OF YOURS. YEAH. (Ivory) AND I AM GOING TO FEED HIM TO THE WOLVES. (Conaker) NO! NOW, IVORY, YOU-- TOMORROW, LOOK FOR THE BONES! [gun firing] (Conaker) HELP! FIRE! (Elmore) HEY, IVORY DON'T NEED OUR HELP GETTING' HIS REVENGE. LET'S MAKE FOR THE COUNTY LINE, OLD BUDDY. HELP! FIRE! FIRE! YOU CAN MAKE ME WATCH BUT YOU CAN'T MAKE ME GIVE A HOOT. WELL, WE'LL SEE. WON'T BE LONG NOW. I SAW A DOG HAVE PUPPIES ONCE. (Banjo) WHOA, DIDO. EASY, LADY. IT WASN'T NOTHIN' MUCH. [Dido grunting] (Banjo) WHOA, WHOA, NOW. YOU KNOW, MOLLIE SURE DIDN'T LIKE IT WHEN YOU TOLD HER TO GO BAKE A CAKE. THAT STUFF AIN'T IMPORTANT RIGHT NOW, JUST KEEP SHUT. (Banjo) ANY MINUTE NOW. THERE. THERE, IT'S STARTIN'. THIS FOAL'S MORE PRECIOUS THAN MOST. THE ONLY SURVIVIN' GET OF THE CHAMPION, SAMARKAND. YEAH, I KNOW. I READ THEM PAPERS YOU GAVE ME ALONG WITH DIDO. THEY TRACE HIS LINE CLEAR BACK TO THE DARLEY ARABIAN. YOU KNOW, YOU AND ME ARE LUCKY IF WE CAN REMEMBER OUR GRANDFATHER'S FACE, OR HIS FATHER'S NAME. BUT THE BLOOD OF FINE HORSES RUNS BACK THROUGH MAN'S HISTORY. THE SPANIARDS, THE DESERT CHIEF OF ARABY, OLD HANNIBAL'S ARMY, ALEXANDER THE GREAT. BUCEPHALUS WAS THE HORSE HE RODE, JUST LIKE YOU'RE GONNA RIDE THIS ONE, OR-- SHOULDN'T YOU HELP HER? NO, SHE'S DOIN' FINE. SHE KNOWS. ALL MOTHER THINGS JUST KNOW. THERE, SEE? A LITTLE PAIN, A LITTLE BLOOD, AND THE WONDER OF IT. THE PURE WONDER OF IT. (Banjo) COME ON, LET'S CLEAN HER OFF. [horse approaching] WILL YOU LOOKEE, HERE? A STAR, JUST LIKE HIS DADDY. THAT'S A SURE SIGN OF GLORY AND GOOD FORTUNE. YEAH? FOR WHO? I'M GONNA IGNORE THAT. I'M GONNA GO CALL MOLLIE OUT. [foal neighing] [Ivory yells] [sighs] UNCLE BANJO. [exclaims in horror] I DIDN'T KILL HIM, NOT YET. OH, NO. NOT UNTIL HE SEES WHAT I'M GOING TO DO TO THAT COLT. NO, DON'T, PLEASE! I NEVER BEGGED. BUT WHY? IT'S PRECIOUS AND IT'S ONLY BEEN BORN! LEARN THIS, KID. EVERYTHING ALIVE IS BUZZARD MEAT. YOU, ME, AND THAT COLT. WHEN AND HOW MAKES NO DIFFERENCE. YES, IT DOES. IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE! DON'T! YOU CAN'T! [grunting] [chickens clucking] [cows mooing] [grunting] [pigs squealing] [Dido neighing] YEAH, GET HIM. GO! BAKE A CAKE. PUT SOME COFFEE ON. SMILE AND KEEP OUT OF THE WAY. BANJO HACKETT, YOU ARE AN EXASPERATION, AND I AM NO CRACKERJACK. [scuffling] [gun firing] BACK OFF! DO IT OR I'LL SHOOT. BUT I'M A BETTIN' MAN. YOU HEARD ME! I'M BETTING YOU HAVEN'T GOT TIME ENOUGH TO LEVER ANOTHER CARTRIDGE. [gun cocking] [gun firing] [crying] [cock crowing] (Banjo) THERE GOES THE SAM IVORY. MOLLIE, IF I HAD IT IN ME TO SETTLE DOWN AND PICK UP WITH A GOOD WOMAN-- WE'VE HAD SOME GOOD TIMES, HAVEN'T WE? THEY'RE NOT OVER. NO, I HOPE NOT, WITH SOME CHANGES. LIKE WHAT? THERE'S A CHILD IN THE TEEPEE, RIGHT? I WISH-- NO, YOU DON'T. YOU'RE A FREE SPIRIT, BANJO, AND THAT'S NOT TO BE CHANGED. [horse approaching] SHERIFF TELLS ME YOU ALMOST LOST YOUR SHOP LAST NIGHT. YEAH, JUST ABOUT DID. YOU KNOW, THE ONLY GOOD THING TO COME OUT OF THIS WHOLE THING WAS THAT MR. TIP CONACHER GOT SUCH A SCARE THAT HE QUIT TOWN AND WENT BACK TO RUNNIN' HIS RAILROAD. WELL, HALLELUJAH. DON'T START REJOICING TOO SOON. HE SAID HE'D COME BACK AFTER THAT COLT AS SOON AS HE'S OLD ENOUGH TO WEAN AND WITH A PRICE YOU COULDN'T REFUSE. I'M GONNA GO TALK WITH JUBAL. WELL, NOW THAT YOU'RE ON THAT SUBJECT, WHAT'RE YOU GONNA DO ABOUT HIM ANYHOW? I DON'T KNOW. WELL, YOU JUST CAN'T THROW HIM BACK IN THE WATER LIKE SOME UNDERSIZED TROUT. YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO KEEP HIM. NOW HOW CAN I DO THAT? THE BOY NEEDS PROPER BRINGIN' UP AND REGULAR-- HABITS AND SQUARE VIRTUES. YEAH. OH, BANJO, WHAT'S THE GOOD OF ALL THAT IF THERE'S NO HEART IN IT. THE KID COULD TAKE JUST ABOUT ANYTHING EXCEPT NOBODY WANTING HIM. DID I SAY I DIDN'T WANT HIM? WELL, NOW, JUST WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM? HIS NAME'S WONDER AND I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU DO WITH HIM. HE'S YOURS. LIKE THE CHEYENNE SAY, "UNTIL THE STONES MELT." WHAT GOOD'S THAT IF YOU'RE GONNA-- YOU AND ME ARE STICKING TOGETHER, SON, AGAINST WHATEVER THE FUTURE MAY BRING. WHY? BECAUSE I LOVE YOU. (Jubal) WELL, WHAT ABOUT WONDER? WHAT ABOUT HIM? WELL, HE'S TOO LITTLE TO GO WITH US. I MEAN, OVER THOSE MOUNTAINS AND ROUGH PLACES. WELL, WE CAN LEAVE HIM AND DIDO UP AT THE ACE HIGH LIVERY.
