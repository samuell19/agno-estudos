(GENTLE MUSIC) Subtitles by explosiveskull NARRATOR: Here in lovely Marmlikon, Mr. Moll has lived his whole life long. He works up at the factory high on the hill for all to see, where all the best of this and that is blended into chocolate. (MAJESTIC MUSIC) Far and wide, Wise's chocolates are found. In far-off China, they're quite renowned. Moll and his family you're bound to meet at number seven Garden Street. It seems that all's still hushed and calm, but will it stay that way for long? The children doze in the morning sun, their dreams of cotton candy spun. Next door, it's all a cacophony, as Papa snores in symphony. (SOFT SNORING) (ALARM CLOCK RINGS) Responsible Willy likes the clank of pennies in his piggy bank. He's saving up to buy a bike, not like Fritz, that rowdy tyke. Evi loves her dog of plush. If only it could really ruff. (DOG BARKING) High up from his attic seat, Fritz is scanning 'cross the street. Where should he aim his arrow and bow? The garden gnome! The perfect goal. Now Mama wants to get to cooking, But it seems that something's not quite working. 'Cause all that's dripping from the sink is just the tiniest little plink. (PLAYFUL MUSIC) (SOFT CHUCKLING) Our gallant Moll, not one to shrink, crawls 'neath the sink and gets to work. But where has all the water gone? Moll grabs his drill and forges on. He nearly knocks his house to bits. Will he decide to call it quits? (EXPLOSION BOOMS) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) But our tale is only getting started. I'll go get Fritz! NARRATOR: It isn't one for the faint-hearted. Where kids are the ones who save the day. EVI: Fritz, breakfast! NARRATOR: And grownups act like babes at play. (GROANING) (YELLING) MR. GRIMM: Oh! Oh, Mr. Grimm! Help me, I've been shot! That's assault on an officer! (GROANS) I've been shot! It's a scandal! The guilty parties must be taken - into custody at once! - Hold on. I'll get you down. (YELLING) (GROANING) Oopsie. Are you hurt? Aha! The Corpus delicti! Or should I say: the criminal's weapon. Do you have any idea who fired this, Mr. Moll? - No idea. - No idea? Nope. I've been working the whole time. Our water's out. I've been looking for the leak in the pipes. Look. We can't get a single drop. Oh! Oh! Sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to, I... (GROANING) I didn't meant to. - Yoo-hoo, water's on! - Yes, yes, I know. - Hello, Mr. Grimm. - Hello. You do know that you need a permit to mess around with the water pipes, right? I didn't know that. I'm really sorry. I'll let it slide this time. But only because I have important things to do. Just wait until I find that whippersnapper. Oh! (PLAYFUL MUSIC) It wasn't my fault. I wasn't even aiming for him. So then? At the neighbor's dog. That's not true! Besides it's only made of rubber. It's still dangerous. You can't shoot animals. I didn't shoot an animal! I shot Mr. Grimm. Yes! That's even worse! What'll happen if he finds out? You'll go to jail! He's never found anything out, ever! That's bad logic, Fritz. Now now, you can argue all you want, but if you don't get a move on, you'll be late for school, and you'll be late for work. Better get to it! (GROANING) (PLAYFUL MUSIC) Alright, gentlemen. Let's talk. I'll get right to the point. Marmot sales are lagging. That's to say: Our chocolate's not bringing in enough dough. Sure it's a tough market. And it's a global market. But, as Conrad Wise would say: "There are no problems, only opportunities in disguise." Now then: How do we increase our efficiency? What can we do? What should we do? What will we do? You've got the floor. Yes, Moll? You don't have to raise your hand. We're not in school. I think people don't like, our chocolate anymore because we don't put as much effort into it these days as we used to in the old days. I see. Yes, but I have an idea for how to make our marmots the best in the world again. First of all, we'll up the milk chocolate by 24%. And then we'll add two more millimeters of white chocolate around the ears. We'll add some scrumptious strawberry flavor to the nose. And a little smidge of lemon to the tail. And that's the new chocolate marmot from Wise's Chocolates! The best the world has ever seen. Aha. (SNIFFING) It's a nice idea, Moll. Mmm. But no. Yes, but I haven't told you everything yet. It's too much work. We need to be more efficient, - not more expensive. - But in time, - when people notice that... - There's no time! I want results, and I want 'em now. So, new strategy. We don't make better chocolate marmots, we make more chocolate marmots. Voila. Quantity over quality. Our new goal: 10,000 marmots ready by Monday. We already got an order from Shanghai. In China. 10,000 by Monday? But! That's impossible. Impossible imschmossible. You've just got to run the machine faster. But then the chocolate won't be mixed long enough, and... You think they're gonna care in China? Listen. I'm gonna tell you something. These days, you can sell anyone anything. As long as there's a lot of it. Capeesh? What is it? Go on. Get to work. (OMINOUS MUSIC) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (CREAKING) (BEEPING) WORKER: Oh! It's so fast! 10,000 marmots by Monday. How will we manage? We've got to manage. We've got to. (GENTLE MUSIC) FRITZ: I'm always the one who gets in trouble. WILLY: 'Cause you're always the one - doing something stupid. - Uh-uh. Guys! Look at this! Wow. Colossal Houndini, the Flying Pooch. Oh, how sweet. Look who we have here. Whaddaya want? Whaddaya think? Empty your bags. Empty our bags? Okay. Are you nuts? Cut that out. What's up with you? Waiting on an invitation? Forget it. Excuse me? Ow! Are you insane? (GRUNTING) (OMINOUS MUSIC) - No! - Chewing gum, - marbles, Band-Aids. - Let me down! Let me down! Boring! Ah! A Swiss Army knife, cool! Give him his knife back! It was a Christmas present! How sweet. I'm getting the sniffles already. Do something! Something like what? - Give me my knife! - You're so mean! And you're bigger than us. Why don't you just leave us alone? We didn't do anything to you. No, don't! Let go of me! You'll pay for this! You'll pay 100 times over! No, don't! Help me! (LAUGHING) No, help me! (GROUP APPLAUDING) This is Conrad Wise, the founder of our famous chocolate factory. He brought it into the modern era and made it the world's best. He wasn't just a great businessman, he was a great man. Industrious, rigorous, and fair. Today, his company ships chocolate marmots around the world. From Tanzania and Tajikistan to Mongolia and even China, as we see here. Today, Conrad Wise is an old man and has no more contact with society. He still owns the company, but Mr. Schlock now runs it for him. - Hey, that's our dad! - That's right. Ha! I must be seeing things. And where have you been? Uh, in the dumpster. In the dumpster? Yeah, but it's not our fault! We were mugged! By those two over there! What? That's such a nasty lie! They mugged us! Not us them. That's not how it was! (JACKIE SOBS) Jackie. Don't cry. I'm sure it's all a misunderstanding. You nasty liar! That's enough, Fritz! First, you come late, then you blame other kids for it, and now you want to hit Jackie. That behavior is unacceptable. It's just unacceptable. (SOMBER MUSIC) EVI: So? What does it say? Whaddaya think? That our parents have to go to school and listen to Miss Stern complain about us again. It's not fair. I think we should just throw this letter away. Are you nuts? That'll just make everything worse. Got a better idea? I think we should talk to Mom and Dad. Explain it to them. They'll never believe us. No one ever does! - Even if they do believe us: Jackie and Johnny will get in trouble, and then they'll get us back for it double. Gimme that. Yeah! (PLAYFUL MUSIC) Yeah! (SIGHING) (CHUCKLING) Hm? Oh. MRS. MOLL: Ta-da-da-da! Oh! Huh, whaddaya think? What? About my new beachwear? I bought it special for Bad Zurzach. (CHUCKLES) What? Bad Zurzach? Yes, the wellness retreat with the ladies' group. Did you forget? Oh! No, no, no, no. No worries. (GIGGLES) Yes, and what are you going to do this weekend? Can we go to the circus? To see Colossal Houndini! The Flying Pooch. He's a sensation! Can we go, Daddy? Please? Ah, alright. To celebrate our Saturday together, we'll all go to the circus. To see the Flying Pooch. Thank you, Daddy! (UPBEAT MUSIC) (CHUCKLING) (PHONE RINGS) Moll, quality control. How's it going, Moll? Uh, yes. Stellar. Listen up. I heard you're going to the circus on Saturday. Yes. Why? Excellent. Idea: Wanna take my kids with you? - What, I mean, why? - Yeah, my wife's going to Bad Zurzach on that wellness blah, blah, blah. Yes, yes, mine too. And I've got a meeting Saturday afternoon. Super important. Can't be moved. It's about the future of the company. So: You, my kids, circus. Got it? No, I wanted to, I mean. Okay, I guess I can ask my kids. (CHUCKLES) Good one. Ask your kids. Listen, Moll. I thought about your marmot plans again. Not a bad idea. Oh, yeah? Really? MR. SCHLOCK: Yeah. Once we finish up the Shanghai job, I'll talk to Mr. Wise about it. Okay? - Mr. Wise himself? - That's what I said. He listens to me. I think this could be your big chance, Moll. Just imagine it: A raise, a bigger office, maybe even one with windows. Whaddaya think, huh? That sounds amazing. Thanks, Mr. Schlock. Great. I'll bring my kids by your place around noon on Saturday. See you then. (DIAL TONE BEEPS) Not on your life! What? Why not? - 'Cause they're dirty rats! - Hey! Watch your mouth. But it's true. They're so mean to us! Yesterday, they mugged us and put me in a dumpster. A dumpster? Well, I can hardly believe that. - But it's true! - I don't know, Fritz. Did you provoke them? Not a chance! I'm just saying. You're no angel, Fritz. And there are two sides to every fight. I'm not going to the circus with those rats. I'd rather move to Australia. We go to the circus together or not at all. D'ya hear me? Fritz! (DOOR SLAMMING) (SIGHS) EVI: Fritz, please. FRITZ: It's out of the question. But you heard what Dad said. Either we go together or not at all. Then not at all! You're so mean. And selfish! I mean, Do you seriously think Dad is doing this 'cause he wants to? What? Taking Jackie and Johnny to the circus. I bet his boss is making him. That's right. And if we don't help Dad now he'll lose his job. And then we won't have any more money and we can't go on vacation. That's silly. Fritz, please. It's only for two hours. Please. All right! But I'm not saying a word to them. Thank you, Fritz. You're the best brother in the whole world. Thank you, thank you, thank you! (BIRDS CHIRPING) Now then I packed savory pastries for lunch in the blue bin. The sauce is in the yellow one. No, orange. 'Cause yesterday's beef is in the yellow one. You can warm it up for dinner. And for dessert, you've got apple cake. But careful now! 'Cause Willy's allergic. (HORN HONKS) Oh! They're here! WOMAN: Wo-hoo, hello! Woo-oo! (WOMEN CHEERING) Yeah, I'm coming! so the orange is? I've got to run, darling. - You'll be alright alone? - Oh yes, yes. I could do it blindfolded. (CHEERING) - Have a nice time! - Bye, bye. - Bye! - Bye, Mom! - Bye! - Bye! WILLY: Bye! Moll, what's up. How are ya? Hi, Mr. Schlock. Hi, Mr. Moll. Ah! Hi Jackie, Hi Johnny. How are you? I'm so excited for the circus. Uh-huh, so are we. So gimme a call if anything comes up. Don't let these two get outta hand, okay? Always show 'em who's boss. And you two do as Moll says, okay? Yes, Daddy. Alright. Have fun. I will, Mr. Schlock. So (CHUCKLES) this is gonna be a great day, right? I'm so excited for the circus. (YELLING) (UPBEAT MUSIC) Yay! Come over here, kids! Daddy, Daddy, I really wanna see the Flying Pooch. Yes, yes, the Flying Pooch. Kids, should we get some cotton candy first? KIDS: Yeah! ANNOUNCER: Attention, attention! Would Mr. Moll please come to the ticket booth? I repeat! Mr. Moll, please proceed to the ticket booth immediately. Wait here, kids. I'll be right back, huh? (OMINOUS MUSIC) Oh, now I'm really scared. For me? - Yeah. - Thank you. Hello? Mr. Moll? It's Klutz. You need to come in right away. The machine isn't running. (SOMBER MUSIC) (SIGHING) Just turn it on again! Yes, I tried, but nothing happens! I think one of the gears is sticking. What should I do now? Did you restabilize the pressure in the flow valve? Flow valve? Klutz, don't touch a thing. Stay right there. Eh I'll call you back. Okay. Got it. Klutz out. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) - For you. - Ah! Lands alive! MAN: More play, less talk. What is it? Uh, it's Moll from quality control. We've got a problem. With the kids? No, no, in the factory. The machine isn't running. Klutz just called me. So, take care of it. But I'm at the circus with your kids... Listen, Moll, what part of important meeting didn't you understand? - I know, but... - No buts! The production line's gotta get moving ASAP! If we don't wrap up the Chinese order on Monday, I'll hold you personally responsible. Goodbye. Listen up, kids. Here are your tickets. Go on in and I'll be right there. What? But why? Where are you going? I have to run to the factory. But Dad, the show's about to start! I won't be long. Here some money for cotton candy. But share, okay? - Okay. - I'm off. I'll take that. Hey give that back! Chill out, buddy. (OMINOUS MUSIC) (GIGGLING) Hey, you! (SNORING) Huh? Hello? Mr. Moll! - Finally. - Klutz, what did you do? Nothing! Not a thing! It just won't work anymore. (BEEPING) Ah! Ah! There. There's something blocking the gears. That's not good. We've got to sound the alarm! We've got to, uh no! - What? - Have you lost your mind? The alarm is to be used in emergencies only! Yes, but isn't this an emergency? Yes, I know, I know. I have an idea. (MAJESTIC MUSIC) Mr. Moll? Hello? Mr. Moll? (BUBBLING) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) Here! I've got it! Here, got it. A hazelnut? How did that get into the gears? It doesn't matter! We need to turn the machine back on. Okay. Understood. Now go! We lost too much time. We'll never be able to finish the order for China. Then we've just got to run the machines even faster. I don't think this is a good idea. I really don't. It'll be fine. We just have to make sure the pressure in sector B doesn't get too high. And if it does, just switch the offset lever in the chocolate vat and connect flow valve B into the cooling unit in sector A. Got it? Yeah, sure. Okay. I've got to get back to my kids. Have a nice weekend. Oh. See you, Mr. Moll. (CROWD LAUGHING) Want some? (CROWD LAUGHING) Look up there! It's a flying zebra! What? Where? TOGETHER: Huh? (LAUGHING) D'you got a screw loose? Let's go, Johnny! Fritz! Hey, outta my way! Hold it right there! We've got to help him! I said from the start that this wasn't a good idea. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Just come on already! Come on, hurry up! (JOHNNY GROANS) Oh. (MISCHIEVOUS MUSIC) - Hurry up! - Fritz? Fritz! Fritz? Hmm. Fritz! (BARKING) (WHIMPERING) Colossal! Did they lock you up? You poor baby. You want out, don't you? What are you whining about, ya dumb mutt? Our show's about to start. (CHUCKLES) I mean, sweet little doggie. Good Colossal. Look, Papa Rasputin has treats for you. He's a little nervous. For his show. (OMINOUS MUSIC) (ALARM RINGS) PREFORMER: Better hurry, guys. - Come on. - Where is he? I'm sure he's hiding here somewhere. Yeah, but where? - Where is he now? - How should I know? - What do we do now? - What do you think? We find him! Look over there behind the suitcases. He's gotta be around here somewhere. Yeah! BOTH: Huh? There! Now we got him. (GRUNTING) Ugh! Fritz! I know you're in there! Fritz! Ladies and gentlemen, children of all ages, come one, come all to Circus Pompinelli! (CROWD APPLAUDS) Prepare to be amazed by an afternoon filled with fun, excitement, and spectacular feats! Jackie? - Full of magic and mystery! - You okay, Jackie? What are you doing here? - My sister. - Get out of here, you rascal! Out! In you go. POMPINELLI: And now, it's time for our main attraction! The Flying Pooch! Colossal Houndini! Huh? You stupid mutt! Get back here right now! POMPINELLI: But enough talk! It's time to see the flying wonder for yourselves! He's not here. - Let's count down together! - Hey! POMPINELLI: One, two, three! No, don't! (CROWD GASPS) (JACKIES SCREAMS) (CROWD GASPS) (CHICKENS CLUCK) Help me! Have you all gone crazy, you idiots! - I'll get you for this! - Goodness gracious, child. Huh? You're all a bunch of idiots. - Are you okay? - You'll regret this. Oh, yeah, you will! What were you thinking? - Help me! - Fritz! Did you see? Wasn't it awesome? Have you lost your mind? And where's Evi? Huh? I thought she was with you? I thought she was with you. Evi! I don't think Rasputin is nice to Colossal. Poor doggie. He's a real sweetheart. He wants to come home with me. Yeah, but he can't. Now take him back. - No! - Evi! Do it! (SIREN BLARES) I think we should have this conversation somewhere else. EVI: Colossal, hurry! Is the show over? Yes well, it was canceled. Just imagine: Someone shot a little girl out of the cannon! A girl? Yes! This never happened in the old days. Let's start over: This boy stole your cotton candy and hid it in the cannon. Uh, no. It was him who hid in the cannon. Koller, stay on track. I'm investigating. Jackie, what's wrong? Where are the others? Aha Mr. Moll. You know this girl? Write that down. Of course. She's Jackie Schlock. What happened here? An as-yet-unknown assailant stole this girl's cotton candy and then shot her through the tent with the help of a cannon. But in the process, and this is a key detail, he lost this shoe. So! Now I want you to think. Do you know this boy? Have you seen him before? Do you know his name? Take your time. Take all the time you need. No. I have no idea. I've never seen him before. Help! Mr. Pompinelli! Mr. Pompinelli! Something horrible has happened. Colossal is gone! Disappeared. I think he was kidnapped. - What? - Yeah. This is all I have left of him. Colossal. - Colossal. - Oh, lands alive! We're ruined! Hold on, hold on, hold on. Who's this Colossal? Hm? (WHIMSICAL MUSIC) Can't you just let it go? We should negotiate. Maybe then they'll leave us alone. You can't negotiate with rats. You have to demand respect to get it. Or to get a real beating! Willy, you're such a wimp. I'm not a wimp. I'm a realist. JACKIES: It was so nice of you to pick us up. I don't know what we would have done if you hadn't come! (WATER SPLASHES) (GASPING) Fritz! (GASPING) Ugh. But I thought it was Jackie! Uh-huh, so you can dump a bucket of water on Jackie's head, huh? I was only... And you can shoot her out of a cannon at the circus? It was all in self-defense! Self-defense? Bah. You should be grateful she didn't rat you out to the police. What? And now you're going to apologize. Not a chance. Oh, yes you will. No! Fritz, I'll tell you one last time. You apologize right now, or you're grounded for two weeks! But that's not fair! Fine. Three weeks. What? Four weeks. - But... - Five weeks. Okay, whatever. - I'm sorry. - What? I wanna hear it. I'm sorry I shot you out of the cannon It's okay. No big deal. I'm sure you didn't do it to be mean. Okay. Now shake hands. Now then, that wasn't so bad. It feels good to be friends again, right? - (BARKING) - Eh? Um. Ah! (SIRENS BLARING) What's that dog doing here? Attention! This is an important announcement from the police. Colossal Houndini the Flying Pooch, star of Circus Pompinelli, has been kidnapped! Information resulting in the kidnapper's capture will be rewarded with 2,500 gold coins, as well as 10 kilos of cotton candy. Attention, attention! This is an important announcement from the police. Colossal Houndini the Flying Pooch... 10 kilos of cotton candy. Don't worry, Colossal. You're safe with us. But Evi that's not okay. You can't just take any dog you want. That's what I said from the start. But they're really mean to him at the circus. I saw it! The mean old trainer keeps him locked in a cage. Right, Colossal? Okay listen to me. We have to take the dog back. You heard it: The police are looking for him. (WHIMPERING) Come. Give him to me, please. Stay strong, Colossal. I'll come visit you soon. (WHIMPERING) (SOMBER MUSIC) Shouldn't we come along? Just in case? Hands off! You just want the reward. What? That's a nasty lie! That's enough, Fritz. No one is getting a reward. I'm taking the dog back, and you, you guys clean up this mess. Understood? Yeah, Mr. Moll. (BARKING) (GASPING) We have some unfinished business. Grab him! (GROWLING) (CACKLING) As head of this investigation, I can assure the residents of Marmlikon that we will use all of the resources that are available to us to bring the kidnapped dog to safety as quickly as possible and to bring the guilty parties to judgment swiftly and judiciously. (CROWD APPLAUDS) Thank you. Thank you, ladies and gentleman. Thank you for your support in these difficult times. The next show will begin in just a few moments! Yoo-hoo, Mr. Moll! Hello! Hello, Miss Stern. Did you hear the Flying Pooch was kidnapped? Yes, truly terrible. What kind of horrible person would do such a thing? Yes. (DOG BARKING) - (COUGHING) - Are you okay? Yes, yes. Just a little cold. - Nothing serious. - Ah! But what I wanted to ask you, Mr. Moll, did you get my letter? Your letter? Yes, the letter I wrote you. Thank you. Thank you for the letter. Very nice letter. Uh, nice? I mean, I don't know. I thought we should talk about... Yes, we should. We really should! But not now. Right now is a bad time. I mean, I don't feel so good right now. (DOG BARKS) (COUGHING) See you later! Maybe next time Ms. Stern. - Goodbye! - Goodbye. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) Ah! Yes, yes you poor pooch. I'm sorry too, but this is the way it has to be. (WHIMPERING) Oh. Oh! Oh no. (WHIMPERING) MAN: Better hurry, guys! (BARKING) So what should your punishment be, you cotton candy thief? We could make him eat his own shoes. That's boring. I have a much better idea. We'll let you go. Under the condition that you and your stupid brother get that dog back. - What? - But why? And then we can collect the reward! Nice work, genius. You won't get your paws on Colossal. So, Fritz? Whaddaya say? Have we got a deal? Not on your life! So then I guess I have to go to the police and tell Officer Grimm who it is who's shooting poor little girls out of cannons at the circus. And stealing dogs. Huh? No! What is it? Fine then. I'll do it. Nice. Johnny, untie them. Just the two boys. The girl stays here. As a hostage. (LAUGHING) (BARKING) Huh? Well, lookie here. Just you wait. Ouch! You wanna bite me now? That's just going too far. (BARKING) Shoot. Are you sure you wouldn't rather go to the police? Shh! Alright, friend. Dogs who don't listen learn their lessons. I'll show you how we shut up a mutt who bites his master! (BARKING) (LAUGHING) (KNOCKING) - Rasputin? - What now? FRITZ: The maestro wants to see you. Not now. He says it's urgent. Ugh. Wait here. Oh, I can't believe this. Stupid mutt. (GROANS) Are you really sure this is a good idea? Got a better one? Here, take him. Come on, let's go. I said right from the start... The maestro wants to see to me, huh? FRITZ: Colossal, come! You, hey! Come back! (GROANING) (YELLS) (SCREAMING) (BARKING) (LAUGHING) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (GROANS) Yes! RASPUTIN: Ah, I've been hit! That really hurts! I'll get you kids! (EXOTIC MUSIC) (GASPING) (CROWD GASPS) (CROWD APPLAUDS) Bravo! (OMINOUS MUSIC) - (YELLING) - What are you doing here? I'm sorry, I... Psst. - Tada! - Ooh! - (CROWD APPLAUDING) - Take a bow! (LAUGHS) Thank you! (CROWD LAUGHS) Take a bow! (LAUGHS) (CROWD APPLAUDS) (CROWD LAUGHS) WOMAN: Mr. Moll? Phone for you. Hi, it's Moll. Mr. Moll? It wasn't such a good idea to let the machine run so fast. It wasn't a good idea at all. It's making really funny noises. Did you connect flow valve B to the cooling unit in sector A like I said? Yes. I mean I think so. I don't know. And what about the offset lever? Oh, the offset button. No, No, Klutz! Not the button. The lever, the lever! Lever, lever! The lever! Bottom left! Ah, there! Ah, now. Thank goodness. Well done, Klutz. Thanks, Mr. Moll. - You're the best. - Yes, yes, yes. I know. I know, I know. WOMAN: Make your phone calls at home! (SIGHING) (THUMPING) (OMINOUS MUSIC) (ROARING) (SCREAMING) chocolate bunny. No, don't! Don't! Stop! That's mine! Stop it! Leave that alone. (GASPING) Just look at that. Sweet little doggie, little sweet pooch. Give it here. First, Evi. First, the dog. Both at once. (DOG WHIMPERS) (DRAMATIC MUSIC) That's right, come to me, sweet thing. Bye, losers. Snooze you later. Thanks a billion. (DOG WHIMPERS) Colossal. (SOMBER MUSIC) MR. GRIMM: Let's go over this again. First the dog was gone. Then he was back. And then he was kidnapped again by two kids. Is that right? No, no, no. They were no kids. They were monsters! I tried to stop them, but they shot an arrow at me! You mean this thing? Aha! The Corpus delicti. I've seen this arrow before. Koller! It looks like we're dealing with a serial offender! (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Well, well, the same, exact weapon. If we put together a profile, what does it tell us about the person who did this? Who could've kidnapped the dog? Moll's kids. We rescued him. They were harassing him pretty bad. So can we get our reward now? 2,500 gold coins. And 10 kilos of cotton candy. (OMINOUS MUSIC) Yoo-hoo! Mr. Moll! Mr. Moll. You were so funny at the circus earlier. I didn't know you were in it! Yeah, neither did I. Anyway, what I wanted to tell you about the letter... Yes, your letter. - I think another time might... - I'm really worried. - Oh, I'm worried too. - About your kids, Mr. Moll. Why? What's going on with my kids? Yes, but that's what I wrote you in my letter? Holy smokes. What happened here? What's wrong? And where are Jackie and Johnny? They're taking Colossal back. What? But I just took him back the circus. Yes, but then Fritz and Willy had to go and get him back. What? You got the dog back? Yeah, but only because Jackie made us! 'Cause of that stupid reward. And because of the cannon and the police and 'cause Rasputin is mean to animals. And 'cause they're dirty rats! Now Fritz, I've had enough of that. What's the meaning of these accusations? Why don't you ever believe us? Because it's hard to believe you three. You didn't even show me the letter your teacher gave to you. If you want people to believe you, you have to stop pointing fingers at other people, or else! Or else what? I'm always the one who gets in trouble. whether I did anything wrong or not! Fritz, you get back here right now! Did you hear me? Fritz! (GROANS) Evi? Willy? (PHONE RINGS) What's gone wrong this time? Yes? Moll! Hellolilo! I wanted to see if everything was running smoothly. Ah, yes, everything is great. Did you find what I packed for lunch? MR. MOLL: Uh, yes, well I... Listen, I forgot to tell you in the freezer, I've got a homemade ice cream cake. Don't eat it! It's for tomorrow. We'll enjoy it together when I'm back, okay? And, are you having a nice time? Yes, I am. I really am. INSTRUCTOR: Excellent, and again! WOMEN: Woo! MRS. MOLL: Bye-bye! (DIAL TONE BEEPS) What are you doing? Can't you see I'm packing? But where do you even wanna go? Australia. Anywhere but here. Can you give this to Dad? But Fritz, you can't go just like that. You're still just a kid. When I grow up, I'll come back for you. You'll have to hold out until then. Okay? Hold on a minute. This is for you. But what about your new bicycle? You need the money more now. Thank you, Willy. (SOMBER MUSIC) Fritz? Please come out now, Fritz. Fritz? He's not here anymore. He went to Australia. (WHIMSICAL MUSIC) Ah, Mr. Grimm? Mr. Moll. You're under arrest. And your kids, too for dog-napping. (GASPING) But, Mr. Grimm I need to find my son. Please. That's out of the question. The game is up, Mr. Moll. But you're not allowed to arrest us! We're just kids! Well, well. I'm still in charge of deciding what's allowed and what isn't. EVI: You should be arresting Rasputin instead! He's an animal abuser! MR. GRIMM: Koller! Take that as evidence! Oh, but. Ugh. MR. GRIMM: So Fritz ran off just like that? And you expect me to believe that? Yes, it was all 'cause of Jackie and Johnny! They only wanted the reward money. Well, well. And is that why you shot the girl from the cannon? No! That happened earlier! Jackie wanted to beat Fritz up, because they stole our money and wouldn't give us any cotton candy. So you stole cotton candy, too? BOTH: No! I mean, yes, but it was our money! MR. GRIMM: Money, what money? BOTH: Dad, stick up for us already! Please, Mr. Grimm, I'm sure we can talk about this. They didn't mean any harm. They're just kids. Let me clear this up with them. You'll do no such thing. Slowly but surely, I'm starting to get the impression that you're incapable of raising your own children! How I raise my children is none of your business. Have you lost your mind? That's evidence. Evidence? Don't make me laugh, you, you, you, you provincial patroller! Koller! Lock him up! What, but... I want you to lock him up! And the kids as well! - No daddy, no! - No, please, no! You can't do this! I'm innocent! EVI: You can't arrest us. We're just kids! I'm sorry, but an order's an order. Colossal! Where are you going with him? KOLLER: We've got to bring him back to Rasputin. But you can't do that! Rasputin is so mean to him. MR. GRIMM: Koller! I'm very sorry. Oh no! (DOG BARKING) (SOBBING) This is for you. For me? WILLY: From Fritz. Dear Dad, If you're reading this, I'm already far away. I'm going to Australia to become a shark scientist. It's better for everyone. Sharks are dangerous animals but they're fair. Not like you. Farewell, Fritz. Am I really so unfair? You never listen to us. But that's not true. I was only trying. Alright. Now tell me what happened. And I'll listen. Without any interruptions? Without any interruptions. I promise. Well, so first off, they tied Fritz to a pole 'cause they wanted his Swiss army knife. Then they put me in a dumpster, but Miss Stern didn't believe me and that's why she wrote a letter, and the letter fell in the drain and we didn't know what to do. and then we had to give the dog to Jackie so she'd let Evi go, and then Jackie took the dog to the police, and then the police came to our house. (CROWD APPLAUDS) And to honor these brave souls who helped me catch the dog-nappers, I hereby present the Marmlikon Award of Service. Bravo! Well done, well done! And where's our reward, huh? Reward? 2,500 coins in gold! (CROWD APPLAUDS) WILLY: then Jackie took the dog to the police, and then the police came to our house and that's why we're here now. (SIGHS DEEPLY) My oh my my. So, what do we do now? (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (SCREAMING) (WOMAN SCREAMS) (WHIMPERING) (SCREAMING) Please stop! Please, please just stop! (WORKERS SCREAMING) (KLUTZ SCREAMS) (KLUTZ SCREAMS) (ALARM BLARES) (SCREAMING) MAN: Oh my! BOTH: What was that? The factory. Klutz must've sounded the alarm. What? Let us out of here! - Hello? - Alarm! Hello! - The factory is in danger! - Let us out of here, please! It's an emergency! (CROWD MURMURING) (OMINOUS MUSIC) Ooh. What is it this time? Alarm? The factory's alarm! (CROWD YELLS) - Please Mr. Grimm! - Mr. Grimm! - Open it, hurry! - Please hurry! This will never do. - I have to get to the factory! - Colossal! (DOG BARKING) Emergency rescue? Police? - Fire department? - Look, there's the key! Go on, bring it to us! Good boy! Yes! Colossal, that's it! Yeah! Take it! Yeah, bravo! - Come! - Hello! - Hurry. - Hello! Mr. Grimm, it's an emergency! Please! It's a matter of life and death! BOTH: Dad, Dad! Ah! Over here, too! Hurry, hurry! Kids! Hurry on home. I have to save the factory. We're not going home. We're coming with you. What? Someone has to look out for you! That's right! (CROWD SCREAMS) That way! Hurry, get in! Let's go! Oh-ho-ho-ho! Hey, look, get that! - Gather around! - Get in! Hurry! REPORTER: Did you get that? Hey! Where do you think you're going? - You're arrested! - Bye. MR. GRIMM: My car! Stop! Stop right there! - Stop right this instant! - D'you get it? Are you getting this? You stinking mutt. I'll turn you into hamburger! Uh. Uh, uh, I mean, uh. Sweet doggie. (CHUCKLES) Woof, woof, woof! Hey! Hey, what are you doing? Don't you see? The dog is gone. If there's no doggie, there's no reward! Take those off! Johnny! We have to get that dog! Let's go! Hey! That's my bike! - Full speed ahead! - Stop right now. Stop right there! In the name of the law! Koller! After them! (DRAMATIC MUSIC) Full speed! (SIGHING) (ALARM BLARING) WILLY: You've gotta drive faster! It won't go faster! Watch out! - The curve! - Yeah! It's okay. Fritz! - It's Fritz! - Where? There! Pull over, pull over! Hurry! Fritz! Hurry, get in. - Not on your life! - Fritz, please. I'm sorry. Really. Yeah right. Just like that? Come on now, Fritz. I believe you. I know I made a mess of things. I should've listened to you. I never should've made you go to the circus with those, with those... With those? With those rats. (CHUCKLING) Are you finished schmoozing already? We have to save the factory. Come on, Dad! - We've gotta go. - Yes, yes, yes. (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (UPBEAT MUSIC) (WOMEN CHEER) ♪ Oh, Chiquita ♪ REPORTER: Alarm in Marmlikon! The residents are fearful. There's total chaos as sirens howl across the city. Dark smoke is rising from the factory. Has there been an accident? An attack? A coup? What are all these people doing here? My husband! - It's still unclear... - My children! What's really going on here. But one thing's for sure: We're living in dramatic times here in Marmlikon. Holy mother Mary! (WOMEN SCREAMING) (WORKERS SCREAMING) Klutz! (YELLING) Alright, kids. I'll be back, okay? Understood! What are you doing? Fritz! (SCREAMING) Faster, you lazy bones! Move it! I am! Klutz! Klutz! Mr. Moll, finally. We have to turn off the machine! It won't turn off! (GROANING) (SCREAMING) (GASPING) Ah, the main breaker. What about the main breaker? We can't get to it anymore. It's much too dangerous. The machine is spitting out hazelnuts. Then we have to shut down the nut chute. KLUTZ: We can't get to that either. Yes! From up top! From up top? (SPUTTERING) Klutz! You man the controls! No. No! The red button! No. No. Oh, come on. I'll do it, Dad. Yes, but Fritz I don't think that's a good idea! Whoa! Other direction, Fritz, other direction! Other direction! I got it! Whoa, too high! Sorry, Dad! (SCREAMING) Whoa, Fritz! What are you doing? Fritz, stop, whoa! Fritz! Hey, what's Dad doing up there? I don't know. Alright! I've had enough. Give me that dumb dog! - No! - For the last time! You won't lay a hand on this dog! D'ya hear me? And don't even think about hurting my sister! Go on! Finish him already! (GRUNTS) Huh? Go on, get him! Run, Evi! - Run away! - Colossal! Don't move! (GRUNTING) Fritz, help me! Fritz, help me. The yellow button! (EVI SCREAMS) No, no! The other yellow button. (JACKIE SCREAMS) (JACKIE YELLS) (BARKING) Colossal, come back! (JACKIE YELLS) (GROANS) Fritz! Please hurry. I can't hold on! (SCREAMS) Oh, oh, oh! Fritz! (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (OMINOUS MUSIC) Mr. Wise! (LAUGHING) (GRUNTING) (GROANING) (CHUCKLING) (MACHINE GROANS) (LAUGHING) Down, bring me down! (DRAMATIC MUSIC) (MACHINE GROANS) (PANTING) Yeah! Dad! Ah, Fritz! You did such a great job. I'm so proud of you. Moll! What's going on? Why isn't the machine running? Well, because it's broken. Isn't it obvious? Broken? Don't be ridiculous. Production must be resumed at all costs. Stop! Stop. That's a very dangerous thing to do. Pah, you scaredy-cat. It's just a little smoke. (MACHINE ROARS) No, it's not. What're you doing? The machine is running fine. No, it's not. It is, Mr. Moll. No. Yes. No! Yes! Yes. Oh. You're a real stick in the mud! MR. WISE: Schlock! Mr. Wise. What a coincidence. I was just coming to see you. What's going on here? Well. Who are you? Moll, quality control. Moll, never heard of you. I developed the revised recipe so our marmots will be the best in the world again. Why? Since when aren't our marmots the best in the world? Uh, well. (SPITS) That's disgusting. Yes, yes, you see? That's just what I told Mr. Moll. It's just shameful! It's always quantity over quality. But he never listens to me. - Is that true? - No, no! Of course not. It's just the opposite. I mean, just look at this, I suggested upping the amount of milk chocolate by 24%. And then I was thinking we should add two more millimeters of white chocolate around the ears. Then we'll add some scrumptious strawberry flavor to the nose and a little smidge of lemon to the tail. A little smidge of lemon. How ridiculous. That's a pretty good idea. Yes, yes, that's just what I said to Mr. Moll. You know it's it's actually like this, you could say the whole idea was mine. Right from the start. But Mr. Moll just expanded on it. On my orders, obviously. Mr. Schlock. Yes? You're fired. But. (SCREAMING) There, now that's taken care of. Bravo, Mr. Wise. You did a great job. And now for you. I need a new overseer. A man of caliber. Are you interested? (GASPING) That would be marvelous. Thank you, Mr. Wise. Well, you did just save my factory. Yeah. But only thanks to my kids. (CHUCKLING) (GENTLE MUSIC) (LAUGHING) Wham, wham, wham. Until he couldn't do it any more. Yeah, and then Jackie couldn't get up any... (GASPING) (WOMEN YELLING) Fritz, Evi, Willy, sweetie. Is everything okay? What happened? Nothing, nothing. Just a little alarm at the factory. I was so worried about you! Dad saved the whole factory! And we helped him! And Dad is the new boss. Oh, really? My heroes. (WOMEN APPLAUDING) (SIGHS) Come on, let's go. Oh. My hero. I said, drive, you saggy sock. Don't brake. Drive! Yeah. WOMEN: Yoo-hoo! Stop! Koller! Turn around. Follow that van! We need to get that dog back. Arrest them! (GROANS) You know what? Arrest them yourself. Wha? Wait, hey, stop right there! KOLLER: Bye, bye! NARRATOR: Officer Grimm is left dumbfounded. It seems his friends have all absconded. Perhaps he's finally learned his lesson: The Molls weren't deserving of his aggression. Colossal went home with the Molls that day, For even the maestro was forced to say, "This dog has got some spark in him. "A cannon is much too dark and grim." Rasputin never did reform, but at least now, he's all alone. The circus folk all hate his guts. They left him there without much fuss. (RASPUTIN WAILS) Here joy and happiness abound. And Mama loves the little hound. Now that our pooch has earned some fame, he needs a new, more fitting name. Day in, day out, Colossal eats, huge heaping plates of potato chips. He chews them up and licks his lips. That's why his brand new name is... KIDS: Chips! NARRATOR: Mr. Moll just gives a smile and rests his weary legs awhile. And now, once more, tranquility reigns, at least until Fritz strikes again. (UPBEAT MUSIC) Subtitles by explosiveskull (SINGING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE) (SOMBER MUSIC)
