Every city has its own midnight diners. Every midnight diner has its own stories. As dusk falls on this city and the people are on their way home, yet my day has just begun. Excuse me, what's the WiFi passcode? There's none. We can't put up a wechat moment post then. The entrance. WiFi signal is good there. It's crazy to eat on the entrance. Some are returning customers living in the neighborhood, while the others are young people passing by. Excuse me, menu please. "Set meal of the day: 40 yuan beer: 15 yuan liqueur: 10 yuan/shot," "three rounds per person” stir-fried shrimps with longjing tea leaves. Guys, what would you like? What would you like? Shrimps. The customers' expressions enable me to make an educated guess about what they'd like to eat. I'll probably work overtime everyday this month. I won't even have time to sleep. No more beautiful skin. These kiddies work in the advertising industry. How come you call us kiddies? You have pretty good hearing. As the years go by, many people passing by eventually chose to stay and become our regular customers. Is this for the customer that always drinks longjing tea? 35 yuan. Hang on a minute. That's enough. I'll wait for you tonight. Chef's cooking is so good. It'll be awesome to dine here every midnight. How about we finish work a little earlier for a change? By the way, I can't travel back to kunshan tonight. Will need to stay at your place again. No problem. You can stay at my place too. That's fine. I'll stay overnight at fan's place. I've left a lot of clothes there. Don't get us wrong. She'll sleep in my room, I'll sleep in the living room. I didn't get you wrong. I always thought you are all sisters! Sisters, exactly. Would you like to join us, uncle zhong? Lian, you're here. Would you like me to start cooking? No hurry. Let's start with some liqueur to clear my palette. Drinking too much with empty stomach is not good for your body. Though you're a man, you don't look manly at all. Way too girlish. How about if I introduce to you a real macho guy to train you up? Sounds good. As long as he's not an alcoholic like you. Wow, this girl has some guts. I like you. Wait a minute. Let's be wechat friends? Horrible mom, sneaked out on me for a drink. Horrible kid, never stop nagging after me. Give me a break, don't you know you are drinking way too much? Getting drunk is better than getting beaten. You're crazier than any women at your age. What are you staring at? Eat if you want to. Fine. Go home as soon as we finish this. Stop drinking. How does my son look? Though he's not some kind of super talent, he is big and strong. Full of muscles. Mom, I'm over 30 years old, stop hitting me on my head. Then hurry up eating. Chef, sorry for the trouble. Watch your step. Focus on your walking! Alright. I almost vomited. Mixing water into the liqueur has been a little secret between lian and I for a long time. Tattletale. Yuan was always bullied at primary school. Luckily, he had a classmate called hu who stood by him no matter what. Hu became a professional boxer and introduced yuan to be his sparring partner. Fall down. Fall down right now! Hu has recently lost a few important bouts. His anxiety has built up. What the heck are you doing? In recent trainings he seems to have lost control. Why were you not this tough during the bout? If you have guts, take a training session with me. That's it for today. Yuan, are you alright? You've done well recently. I'd like you to set you up with a friendly match arranged by a club. Why are you all standing? Keep training. Hu is done for the day. Not yours. Move it! Sorry about today's training. It's okay. I knew you were anxious. I got knocked out on round three! It was just a bad day. I'm not sure if I can still keep competing after this failure. I'll be your sparring partner as long as you need. I'll stand by your side too. Hungry? A little bit. Thank you. Thanks. Yuan. Yes? Have you ever dreamed about doing a real fight? Aren't we doing real fights everyday? I mean the real ring, and fight with a real boxer. Sure, I am fighting a real fighter every day. I'm not joking with you. Amateur boxers like me are literally nothing comparing to professional boxers like you. Where there's a will there's a way. Whose sparring partner will you be after I retire? Muhammad Ali once said, we got to keep going no matter what hardship we encounter. He needs to be your role modal are you mentioning Ali and I in the same breath? Did Ali use a helmet like this? I'm already very satisfied to be your sparring partner. I mean it. Come on. Yuan, I'll figure out a way for you. Thank you, uncle zhong. Come on. I'll be your sparring partner starting from tomorrow. Come on. One two one two one two one two Uncle, smoking will harm your body. Uncle, is that where you live? That's his diner, which is not opened yet. Do you sell sweet lotus root? No. I mean no fresh lotus root in stock. I'll buy some now. Come over when school finishes and I'll make you some. Okay. This is beautiful. How does it taste? It's the second-best sweet lotus root I've ever had. Who made the best one? My dad. Your dad? Yes, but he's gone forever. Chef, how's my helmet going? Right, here you go. Nice job on fixing it. Does it hurt? No. Your nose is all messed up and you still says it does not hurt. Dory, it is not polite. I'm sorry. Was my acting good? Not really. Good. Thank you, chef, for making her sweet lotus root. We got to go. You're welcome. Let me give you a hand. Here. - Thank you. - That's alright. No worries. Thank you, chef. You're welcome. Thank you. I can take over from here. Thank you. Chef, sorry about my mom got drunk last night and caused you trouble. Have you ever thought that she might not be drunk at all? Not drunk? She was drunk enough to be carried home. Didn't you get a chance to eat some stir-fried clams every time you came for her? That's true. You know my favorite dish was stir-fried clams. My daily dish. But now due to diet control I only get to eat it every time I come looking for mom here. Chef, as a matter of fact, stir-fried clams had saved our lives once. The year when yuan graduated from primary school, his father's factory was closed down. Yuan and his mom were left behind by his father who later went back to Hong Kong. Only by then, lian was told that this man was already married. All the sudden she was caught off-guard by dreadful rumors in this small town. For the first time in her life, lian truly experienced a situation that forced her into a dead end. Mom, I'm hungry. Mom. I'm hungry. Don't burn yourself. After yuan was at the diner lian slipped and fell over in the market. Horrible mom. Sorry. Horrible mom, I warned you about not drinking too much. I fell over by accident. By accident? Have you been drinking? Shut it, stop your endless nagging. I won't be a filial son if you keep doing this. I work from dawn to night and put all my efforts in just to save up for your new hat. This is a helmet, not a hat. Can you please don't... Actually being hospitalized wasn't too bad as they detected your mom's spinal issue early. This could be a good way on encouraging her to quit drinking. All this happened because she wanted to buy me a new helmet. My old one is still pretty good though. Yuan, your mom loves you dearly. This new helmet is indeed better than that old one. I had no previous experience repairing a boxing helmet, so it's not as strong. Uncle zhong, I really appreciate your help. Today's on me. You don't have to. - I insist. - You don't. I meant it. I insist. Chef. Here you are. Let me take a look. Chef, morning. Moon, your shift is over? Come back with dory this afternoon. I'll cook her some sweet lotus roots. Okay. Chef. Please pass this on to her for me. This is a bit inappropriate. Alright. He Asked me to pass this on to you. Mom, isn't this beautiful? - Chef. - Uncle yuan, isn't this beautiful? It is. Dory, hurry up eating, I have a night shift to go to. This is the prettiest sweet lotus roots I've ever seen. I feel like saving it. Don't worry, take it home if you can't finish it today. I'll make you an even prettier one next time. Okay. It's on the house this time. Thank you, chef. You're welcome. Let's go. Let me help you. Here. All good. Chef, bye. Take care. Let me. It's alright, I can help. I'll be fine. Yuan. Yuan. She asked me to pass this on to you. What's this? I'm sorry. This is literally the first time ever in my life to listen to symphony. I thought you liked it since you were little? Didn't you play violin when you were young? Did 1? You told me on wechat you love symphony just like I do. Wechat? Wasn't that you? I don't even know your wechat. Look, you've discussed many music chapters with me. Horrible mom. Horrible mom! She's stepped over the line. She pretended to be me and asked moon out. Moon had to ask the hospital for a leave, rushed home, put dory to bed, and hurriedly caught up with me for some kind of symphony. Yet I fell asleep during the symphony. Why the heck did I fall asleep? Would you still have this date without your mom's little trick? But she never considered what my feelings were. Then let me ask you, have you ever considered her feelings? You will understand her efforts in the future. I heard from hu that you have an upcoming match next month. Your opponent is a three-time provincial champion. Train hard. Never underestimate your opponent. Clinch him. Clinch him. Let go. Wear him out. Defense. One. Two. The steps. - Mind the steps. - Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. Are you ok? Yuan, hold on. You got to hold on. Stay strong. You must hold on. Hold on, yuan. He is drained now. Find your chance and go all out. Stand up. Great job. Yuan! Get up! - We won! - We won! We won, yuan. - We won, we won! - Yuan, we won. - You won. - You won! Every kind of food has its origin, so do people. Your origin forms your life's basic foundation. And becomes your very first aspiration. Moreover, it directs your future direction. From now on, I will protect you, and take care of dory with you. This is a brand-new helmet from my mom, never been used. Now I'll give it to you. Can I teach you boxing? Okay. Come on. One two one two show me a champion pose. Some customer walked in by coincidence. Some were introduced by their friends. Yet there was one customer who led herself in relying purely on smell. The rice here smells delicious. Chef, I'd like a grilled eel over rice. Alright, won't be long. - Thank you. - Girl, did you smell what chef was cooking even before walking in here? I actually smelled it from three blocks away. This girl is probably doing advertising-related career like you three, because she loves to exaggerate the truth. Uncle zhong. You guys don't believe me? Let me show you. You ate noodles with soybean paste. You ate scrambled eggs with tomatoes. This must be noodles with preserved vegetables and pork. You could even tell from an empty bowl!? Such a sensitive nose. Of course. My living depends on it. Here's your grilled eel over rice. Enjoy. So, may I ask what kind of job do you do? Le Nez the breast? Uncle zhong, save your dirty talks please. Le Nez which agency do you work for? Don't you know the slogan of our brand? Your body pose looks way too stiff and unnatural. Let me. Xiao Mei is a flavorist of an international aromatherapy company. Relax. The brand is called le Nez, which means “the nose” in French. She has been promoted in recent years and become the marketing director. Here. Relax. Got the shot. Let's call it a day. In fact, everyone has their own smell. Relying on my nose, I can even tell their age. Seriously? Why'd I lie to you? For instance, he's just turned 25, because he smells like milk. You are literally wet behind the ears. I don't smell any milk on me. Actually you are missing a real man's smell. You are missing a real woman's smell. How about me? You are covered in 7 different smells. All mixed up. You don't even know what you truly like, do you? That's right, she has decidophobia. Everyone needs to find a smell that's right for them. Leave me your numbers, I'll find you something. A manly smell exists in men's thirties, or men's forties. However, after their fifties... Why do you give me that look? What's wrong with me? I smell hair oil and nicotine. You consume too much spring onion and garlic. This old man's smell is irritating. Brother, I got to go. Uncle zhong, no wonder you wear a hat every day. You are trying not to pollute the air. And being environmentally friendly. This kiddy talks non sense. I wear a hat because this is the classic old school gentleman style. What's old school gentleman style? Shanghai gentlemen back in the 20s and 30s. Speed up. Speed up again. Don't be lazy. Keep accelerating. Two more hours running. Speed up. Good. Keep accelerating. Accelerating with your full strength. Faster! Yell it out. Louder. I'm so tired. What if someone just loves the plump you? The reason xiao Mei tries so hard to lose weight is because by the end of this month someone will come to Shanghai to meet her. Tai was a senior student in xiao Mei's university. All girls were obsessed with him, so was xiao Mei. However, there are always pretty girls chasing after him. Xiao Mei could only be on the sideline. Sign it for me. We'll be graduating soon, can you please sign on my basketball as something to remember? After graduation, everyone drifted apart and eventually lost contact. Until recently, xiao Mei got to know that tai becomes a director of the Paris head office of xiao Mei's company. By the end of this month, he will attend a conference in Shanghai. This is your destiny. Yes. You got to take this chance to make up for the regrets. In fact, I don't ask for more but to show him my best look. It's the best way to make the dream of my youth worthwhile. Well said. We will exercise with you. We? How weak you are. Fan! You can do it. Get up. Keep fighting. Lean to the left. 15-degree angle. Lean to the right 15-degree angle. Ten. Eleven. Twelve. Thirteen. Fourteen. Fifteen. Great. Next movement, ready, go. Xiao Mei did not come to the diner in the following few weeks. All the regulars are looking forward to hear about what is happening between xiao Mei and tai. Chef. Xiao Mei. I'd like a meal combo. Buns. Today is actually the last day of tai's stay in Shanghai. They met at his hotel. Xiao Mei, you've done a great job. Did you really read them? Of course I did. After I saw your name, I read all of your proposals. So good. You are still the capable little bun from back in those uni years. I called you little bun because you had little fat cute cheeks like buns in the past. Not sure why but everybody thought I should've been together or dated with those girls. Yet, the girl I liked was you. I loved your personality, natural and graceful yet very innocent little bun. Did I scare you? It was my fault that I neither was brave enough nor knew how to tell you about it. Xiao Mei, how have you been? Do you have a boyfriend? No. How about you, tai? Are you married? I put all the efforts into work after graduation and felt days were quite enriched. However, after spending long enough time on work, I've noticed something's missing. Men normally bear heavier loads on shoulders. Based on traditions you'll marry after succeeding in career. Fortunately, I met her, Julia. She made me feel like I needed a partner on this foreign land. I always thought of you at first after being together with her. However, the longer I spent time with her the more I realized that: The right place the right time the right person Xiao Mei, why did you leave without telling me? Take care. Even the most common dish has its unique taste. If you only focus on the commonplace in you, you might miss the uniqueness in your life. You promised me before that you'd keep your temper. According to the public health regulations it's prohibited to feed stray dogs. Dogs that are fed here are no strays. I have to go. I've spent half a lifetime in this city. But the only person that shares my memory of the past is alon. He's an orphan. Growing up in my family, he's been like my little brother. Poor kid. Alon never knows his parents. He's now leaving with you to fight the war. You need to look after him. And come home safe, both of you. Ma'am, here's the receipt. Okay. You can check it. Thank you. It's okay. Whose stuff is this? Move them right away. Mine. They're mine. I'm really sorry. I don't have enough space, so. This is a sidewalk. You're blocking the way for pedestrians. I don't have extra space for them. It may be inappropriate to put them here. But it's only temporary. Move them or pay a fine! Are you deaf? You think the uniform makes you the authority? You're cr az y! Put them away! - You're nuts! - Alon, you promised me you'd keep your temper. But you never did. Don't let me see you ever again. Since that day alon hasn't dropped by once. But I know it isn't because he's angry at me. Alon, be careful! Time leaves its marks on everyone, some on the face, some in the heart. Excuse me. Are you still open? It's cold outside. Come on in first. Come on. Have a seat. This diner has served many customers with lots of stories. But the most memorable to me is always the first customer here, and the first story. Here. Have a hot cuppa. What would you like to eat? Wontons. Then you might need to wait a while. No problem. They taste like what my mom made. You were born in Shanghai? Yeah. But I immigrated to Canada when I was a kid. What brings you back to Shanghai? Found it hard to adapt to the new environment. And my parents died. Is it enough? Yes. Chef, actually I don't have enough money to pay for this. It's okay. I made them as my breakfast anyway. Not to mention the diner was supposed to close by now. Does it mean I can come here after it's closed next time? Anytime. Listen to me, dude. You're a musician so you have to drink alcohol. - That's right. - If you stay sober, it'd be hard for you to find your inspiration. Indeed. Where do I find thee the one who knows me? Fill it up. There you go. That's really impressive. What brought you here? I got my salary today. Wontons? Yes. Same. There's my hidden affection in the corner of solitude there's my lost dream in the rhythm of your song in a world of aphasia in my rackety heart there's you walking into my confusion in a daze with your tearful eyes it's so much like fate we meet on a destined night among the mist destined to get close destined to get high, destined to say goodbye It's a recurrent glioma at a place where it's basically impossible to remove it. Chef. What's the matter, snow? This is a poster of my first single. I want to give it to you. Thank you. Keep it as a souvenir. I'll find a place to put it up. Chef, from now on I may not be able to come here often. Chef, thank you. The wontons you make are exactly like my mom's. Every time I have them it feels like I am home again. So wontons today? You're there with me when I fumble for my dreams when I blunder about in the reality immersed in the warmth of songs and tears in the howling winds we tighten our grip what a pity we can't finish our trip could you please walk me to the other end of the rainbow bridge leave behind the sadness do blossom for me conquer the waves ahead in the darkness when we part travel onward with the beam of light you cast upon me But not long before snow's first single was released... After snow departed this life, shin, every anniversary of when they first met, would come to the diner for a bowl of wontons. You'll meet many people in a lifetime. But not everyone can be your soulmate. The real soulmate are usually those who would stay with you late at night just for a bowl of wontons. Many customers, as time goes by, never come back again. But some that have been away for a long time, at an unexpected moment, would show up before your eyes. May I ask what would you like? The same... Omelet. One moment. How does it taste? This omelet. Slightly bitter, and a bit sweet. How's it? Authentic, isn't it? It's been a long time since I have a taste of home. I knew you'd like it. I found it here the other day when I picked up a guest. Tang song was a taxi driver. He and sisi were both from hunan. They were working in the same city, but tang song drove mostly at night. So they usually came here at a time when he got off work and she was just about to start her day at work for their breakfast. Do you have to do the part-time after that? Yeah. I'm worried that I can't make it there on time. Call me when you finish. I'll go pick you up. But you need to get some sleep. I'm fine. I can take a nap in the car if I'm tired. Don't worry. Eat more. Have some with me. Yummy. Sisi dreamed to become a model. While she was looking for opportunities, she worked part-time at a big company as a receptionist. Fitting commercial work dress rehearsal offer offer you a drink Drink morning, Mr. zhang. Thanks. See you later. What? You arrived? Sorry. Wait a minute. I'm on my way. I need three rolls of invoices. You used them all up in such a short time? You are burning candle on both ends! Pass me a yogurt. I don't want to wear it. Put it on. Leave me alone. Don't move. I don't like it. Don't press too hard. - It's uncomfortable. - Don't move. Does it really look good? I just don't like the words on it. I don't like Shanghai. It looks fine. You must be hungry. Want to go to the diner for an omelet? Nope. I have an audition tomorrow. This is my dinner. No way. You need to have proper meals. I need to go to a fitting tomorrow. Have to keep slim to look good in those clothes. Let me interview you first. Look to your right. To your left. You're beautiful enough, but too skinny. You should have more food. Don't stay starved. Feels so good to walk here. Yeah. You see that building? It's the biggest model agency in Shanghai. I hope one day I will be able to work there. No more receptionist job. There are so many skyscrapers here. They make me feel dizzy. Everything's different from that in our hometown. Only the moon is the same. The moon can be seen everywhere. But such a wonderful scene at night can only be seen in Shanghai. Here's the night scenery you love. We didn't have a chance to do this. Tonight is your night. Enjoy. How do you like it? Spectacular. There are too many people here and heavy traffic. And it's always noisy. It's attractive, a much bigger city than our hometown. And there are more opportunities. I need to learn english well. I won't bow to this city. Every day I drive strangers around here again and again. I don't want to be like them who can never jump out of this loop. In five to six years I'll make enough money for building a big house in our hometown. And I'll start to live my own life. I won't be like others, either. I'm going to carve out a successful career in this city. Sir, excuse me. I have my girlfriend here. - You... - Please. To sinan mansions. Sure. It's okay. I'm fine with it. My name is zhang sisi. I'm from hunan posture pa... sture po... sture how is my posture dress rehearsal commercial work miss? Sir, that'll be 43 yuan. Oh, sorry. Jin is my surname. I'm sisi, learning to be a model. I knew you're cut out for it the moment I saw you. Here's your change. You have great potential. - I think... - Please get off. Mr. Jin... Our company has been cooperating with a live-stream platform. It'd be a good opportunity for beginners. I think you... What's wrong with you? He didn't even finish. He's a pervert. Ignore him. Why? I've heard of this company. It's one of the leading talent agencies. He's apparently drunk. Can you believe a drunkard? I've been driving all kinds of people. There are a lot of frauds like him. It's useless. Throw it away. And again, being famous isn't as easy as you think. You mean I'm not qualified. No. I mean what we have now is good enough. First give me your bag. Your bag. Take off your coat. Take off your cardigan. And sit here. Sit right here. You're going to look at this camera and speak through the Mike here. Here's the script on the table. And a hair dryer. Use it to blow your hair while talking naturally to the viewers. Hi everyone, I'm sisi. It's nice to meet you all here. I come from hunan. Being a model has been my dream, though people around me always think it as unrealistic. Yeah, I miss my family too, especially during new year. I wish I could go home but every new year is the busiest time for me. I have a lot of work to do. I think I'll go back home once I get a better life or become more mature. I don't want my family to worry about me. Tang song, I broke the record! My first live streaming broke their record! I'm thrilled! If I sign the contract with them, I can receive training abroad. I'll be taught singing and dancing by world-class performers, which will help broaden the space for my development. Broader space? So this city is not big enough now. You're going abroad. Why can't we just stay down-to-earth to make some money and go back to our hometown to live a normal life? I've told you a thousand times. I don't want to go back there and live like a nobody. It'll be a life wasted! Countless people dream to become a celebrity, but how many of them can really make it? You're betting your future on something uncertain. Talking about life wasted. At least there's a possibility of a different life. You're different now. I am! I'm more driven to make my dream come true. Your dream? Tell me what your dream actually is. Live-streaming your personal life, leering at the camera, entertaining your audience, asking them for gifts, is that your dream? It's bullshit. Are you out of your mind? What you're doing now, if known by your neighbors and relatives back home, would make your folks embarrassed. What about you? You've been here for years driving a taxi with no ambitions at all. If your family know about it, they will be the one feeling embarrassed. Leave me alone! Slow down. Watch your step. Why did you drink so much? Not much. Just a bit too fast. Get him upstairs. Have a seat please. I need water. Have some tea. Thank you. So you're sisi. Thank you for taking my husband home. Not at all. He's been talking about you a lot, about how you work hard. Don't give up, kid. Thank you, Mrs. Jin. I won't give up. I'll try to live up to Mr. Jin's expectations. I see you love omelets. Have you heard of the waffle house index? It's an informal way to Gauge the effect after a disaster. To be specific, no matter what has happened, as long as the waffle house is still open, the community is safe. What I want to say is we have a “diner index” here. Whenever you pass by this Lane, if you see the lights on in this diner, it means you can come in to have some night snack or a drink. You can tell yourself that it is not the end of the world. Since it's not the end of the world, you can always move on. Now, stop drinking. Have a cup of tea. Remember waffle house index waffle house index If you think it's okay, we'll leave by the end of this month to start a two-year training. It may sound a bit like gambling. But I bet you'll win. What's the matter? You cut your hair. I was out of line the other day. I shouldn't have said that. I apologize. Is that all you want to say? Got it. Bye. Let me finish. We've grown up together, and come to Shanghai together. What are we working so hard for? Isn't it for us to stay happy together? You're right. I don't have ambition to achieve much in the future. But from now on, I'll work harder and harder for you. I'll do everything I can to make you happy. Sisi, Will you marry me? I don't want you to do things you don't like just for me. That's not what I mean. All I want is that we can be like what we were before, staying together, having fun together, talking to each other, driving around together. I want to live a quiet and peaceful life with you. Is it wrong? There's nothing wrong with that. We came here and both found it beautiful. In your eyes there's only the moon above this city. But what attracts me is this entire city. Maybe someday in the future We'll be able to appreciate the same landscape. But as for now, this ring is Not for us. Zhang sisi! You can make it! Slightly bitter, and a bit sweet. I added some bitter melon, in this omelet. Whatever you do it's always bitter at the beginning. But if you hold on with confidence and persistence, through the bitterness, you'll taste the sweetness. When will this winding road home come to an end when can I find the reason for not staying why do I find guilt long-lasting why did I not try at least for whom am I waiting here to whom shall I reveal my loneliness did you think of today when we had a tearful parting would you hold me tight someday when I see you again At the end of the night you walk toward me in the bottom of my heart I have the same feeling tonight is a start of a brand new tomorrow good night, you say, letting me know it's never too late to love At the end of the night you walk toward me good night, you say, letting me know it's never too late to love We were ordered to catch stray cats and dogs. I worried that it would get caught, so I took it home. I didn't know it was pregnant with three puppies. I guess they've wanted to come home. Hey, xiao Mei. Your advertisement has covered all the major platforms today. Sisi is on the cover! Did you see that? Yeah. I saw it. See you tonight. One by one, please. Be patient. These are all fresh-caught clams today. Give me a bag please. Give her a plastic bag. She wants a bag. You're just sitting there listening to music! Unbelievable! One! One two two! Turn. One two one! One two one! One two how do you like the Shanghai opera we watched tonight? It's good. Really good. So would you like to go to the diner? But I'm not properly dressed. Why? You don't like it? I haven't made a dress of this style in a long time. So I got a little rusty. But it came out pretty. Of course it's pretty. It's so beautiful that I might feel shy in front of everybody. Let's go then. My face is not a rag please. A clam for you. Okay. Thank you. Let me help you. Thanks. Every city has its own midnight diner. Every midnight diner has its own stories. You may wonder what kind of customers would go to a midnight diner. Once you come here, you'd find the answer. What's the spirit of a dance band? Symmetry! Mid... Night dine... Er Welcomes you!
