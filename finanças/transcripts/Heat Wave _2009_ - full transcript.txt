Have you ever been crazy in love? l mean crazy to the point of losing all control? A love that makes no sense. A love where all the odds are against you. The more you struggle against it, the deeper you sink. And you know that it's not right... that it's ridiculous. And you tell yourself it has to stop. But you don't want it to stop. Because... ...it's that good! HEAT WAVE No, I don't think Mrs. CIoutierwiII be in today. I can transfer you to someone eIse. No, I don't think she'II be in, because... Gis?Ie? What are you doing here? Just ask the judge for community service. - We'II postpone the hearing. - Why? - You can't do it today. - Try teIIing her that. Her hearing has onIy been postponed twice aIready. She's not even 16... Raped twice. Two abortions. If I were her, I'd be smashing in windows, too. Yes? HeIIo. Laurent wiII be the one going to court with you today. You'II see. He's the best. My condoIences, Mrs. CIoutier. I'II be back to check in after the service. Gis?Ie... After the service, you're going home. It'II be OK. Security, checkout 3. What's wrong? Code 2. I know my codes. Put that down there, OK? Yannick? -You're shopIifting again? - Yeah. The judge gave me a few weeks. No... I'm working at a weIfare centre. I've reaIized how important it is to heIp others. Right. ExactIy. HeIping... is important. That was reaIIy nice, what you just did. If you hadn't been there, I... I don't know what you'd caII it... I'd caII it a professionaI faiIure. Are you Iiving around here now? No. I'm stiII across the river, in L?vis. Quebec City by day, L?vis by night. Back and forth on the ferry. Care for some fish sticks? You toId me once that you Iiked fish. Bad timing. I have a date with a saIad. But you paid for them. I'm not doing that again. Happy to hear it. My hands are frozen, fuck! Take them. Later. Later. Shit. 1200 degrees CeIsius for two and a haIf hours. Any bones that are Ieft over are ground up. Oh yeah? Sorry. I got Iost. HeIIo, Aunt Marjo. HeIIo, twins. You couIdn't caII us by our reaI names for once? It isn't easy, Iosing yourfather. - Hi, Mom. - Hi. Two days of an open casket, I think that's more than enough mourning. That's your anger speaking. That must be it. No hugs for your sister? It'II be aII right. Come with me. You know, compared to Aunt Marjo, Mom seems pretty heartIess. Come on. I'd Iove at a cigarette right now... We shouId go to the cottage. We'II scatter his ashes over the Iake. That's what he wanted. I don't want the urn at the house. My condoIences, Mrs. CIoutier. Everybody at the bank Iiked working with Fred. He was a modeI empIoyee. Thank you. Fred had a... safety deposit box. He did? What for? You'II have to come by and empty it. Right. Pardon me. OId habits die hard. Don't worry. Everything's there. I went to your office. They toId me about your husband. Rotten Iuck, eh? Everything's there. It's not what you think. Let me think what I want to think when I want to think it, OK? You stoIe from me! Do you know what it's Iike to be stoIen from? Do you? Here. - Let's give this a try. -Yes. It's CoIombian. It's reaIIy something. You think I'm crying because he's dead, right? I'm crying because I don't feeI sad. OK. I Iooked after him. I fed him. I washed him. Up untiI the very end. And then guess what he toId me just before he died? PersonaIIy, I wouIdn't ask you that-- but if it makes you happy... He toId me there was anotherwoman in his Iife... ...and it had been going on for years. I'm so... Where were you? What? Are you aII right? I didn't think you'd come by today. I mean, so quickIy. This way. 9-8-7-5... Had I known you were coming, I wouId've invited you out to eat. Here. If you're interested in grabbing a bite after, I know a IittIe pIace. ''Last night was ourfirst night together. And the loveliest. ''l know we should stop, but l don't have the strength. ''But l realize how much this would hurt your wife... ''l love you. l'll love you forever, ''Your Wild Goose.'' Fred Iiked to hunt. I'm more of a fisherman myseIf. If you're interested, maybe one of these days, I couId take you to an incredibIe spot. My IittIe comer of paradise. I don't know why I picked you up tonight. Must be my compuIsive side. Yeah, it's got to be compuIsive. Hey, if you'd rather not, we don't have to. No, no! No, Iet's do this. Let's do this. AII right. So where do we start? I have to taIk to you! Who's she? You Ieft them in the door. She's my aunt. Whoa! Your aunt's not joining in, is she? - Listen, St?phane... - It's J?r?mie. It's not that hard! Go get some heIp. You're both sick! No! Don't go! Out of the way, goddammit! Don't go, J?r?mie! Jesus Christ! I don't want to keep your father at my pIace. This couIdn't wait? Keep him untiI we take his ashes to the Iake. No, I don't want him either. PIease. - No way! - Take him. - I don't want to. - Take him! No! I was his mistress! Hello, you've reached Fred and... Gis?le, that's right. We can't take your call. Please leave us a message. - Mrs. CIoutier? -Yes. We're here for the bed. Ah, yes. Come in. Gis?Ie? I brought you some Iasagna. HeIIo? Anybody home? Gis?Ie? I brought you a big dish of Iasagna. Are you here? Wait, Gis?Ie! Wait! Don't do anything you might regret. What're you on about? You want the gun? Aren't you the one who Iikes hunting and fishing so much? Sure I do. Come with me, then. I have Iots of stuff for you. Thanks for the Iasagna. It's Iike he's stiII here. I'm doing what I can to make him disappear. You shouId go out. Get a change of scenery. You aIways Iook after everyone eIse, but never yourseIf. You shouId get some exercise. Right. Exercise. Do I Iook that bad? He was so proud of his trophies. - Do you want them? - What for? WeII, I'II keep that one. I was with him when he won it. Did Fred teII you about his affair? What did you say? He toId me. Didn't he ever confide in you out there? No. We never taIked about things Iike that. What did you taIk about then? Ducks. MostIy ducks. Do me a favour. Get rid of these cIothes for me, OK? He didn't teII me who she was, but if I everfind out... You know what? I think I wiII take the gun after aII. I don't know. Oh no, my watch... Yes? HeIIo! A IittIe surprised, yes. The fact you've caIIed me here. You want to meet up? Sure. What time? Yes. Yes. You coming? We're setting our bottIes off in the park. No, we're working here. Are you going to rob a bank or something? You Iook Iike a twit, with your bib! He's going to see a girl. So the king is in Iove! With a tie? She'II think you're a twit. Jehovah's witness. Office party. Twit. - Brother-in-Iaw. - No, it's nice. Anyway, you've never had any taste. Just Iisten to Mr. Extreme Makeover here. Come outside and I'II give you an ''Extreme Makeover" ! Hey, guys! This is the one! It Iooks Iike... a tie! Who's the Iucky girI? Not another messed-up bimbo Iike Naomie? Watch out. He'II sIash himseIf again. It's none of your business. A girI who Iikes ties is either stuck up or messed up. - So teII us! Who is she? - Here! - This just came in, my dear sir. -Yeah! CooI! Suits! So messed up or stuck up? This is a cosy IittIe pIace! It is. And there wiII be Iess gossip. Where were we? You were saying she Ieft with everything. Everything! The house, the Winnebago... Shared assets. StoIen assets. Your hair Iooks nice. Thanks. I'm trying a new Iook. Do you stiII go up to your cottage? - The cottage is mine. - OK. But we haven't seen you at your cottage for a whiIe. WeII, with Fred sick, vacations weren't a huge priority. She whined in court about keeping the rowboat. She's scared of water, for Christ's sake! Sorry! I apoIogize. No, no! You shouId've put it on your Ieft. I aIways put my gIass on my Ieft. White underwearwith white. CoIours with coIours. I aIways sIeep on the Ieft side, with my gIass of water on the night tabIe, on the Ieft. I have Iots of IittIe hang-ups Iike that. Thank you for asking me here. It's good to get out. Change perspectives. Gis?Ie? I know that Fred's body isn't even coId yet. I don't want to take advantage of the situation. But... I wiII, just a IittIe, to... -Are you serious? -Yes. WeII... I... I don't want to mix... my work and my private Iife. The office is one thing. And my private Iife is another. We can take aII the time in the worId, if you'd Iike. AII the time in the worId. What's he doing? Let's go see. Guys! Check this out, guys! She's not bad. AIittIe oId for him, no? I wouIdn't pass her up. Hi. Hi. What are you doing here? I wanted to surprise you. These are aII for you! They must've cost a bundIe. Yeah. They're gorgeous. Listen... You know, the first time we met was at the hospitaI two years ago. - OK? -Yes. I don't remember everything we said when I went to see you at your office, but... every time I Ieft, aII I couId think of was you. Me? You. Gis?Ie... I sIit my wrists for a girI, but... I was thinking of you. We can't teII anybody. Even if we wanted to, nobody wouId beIieve us. Weird, eh? But why are you dressed Iike that? I put on this fancy suit. CooI, eh? But why did you steaI my husband's suit? I didn't steaI your husband's suit. It's from the weIfare centre. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter! I have a dead guy's cIothes on! Doesn't matter? But... Gis?Ie! I'm wearing your husband! It matters! You're Iaughing at me. No! - Laugh away! - I'm not Iaughing at you. Like when you were crying because you weren't sad? No, Yannick. Wait! - Wait! - Bye! Mrs. CIoutier. Yeah... Mrs. CIoutier. What are you doing? - I'm caIIing for the horse. - Dipshit! I tried my key. It's not working. The Iock was changed months ago. I thought I'd go for a beer. Want to come? I haven't seen you in ages. Come on! You steaIing driver's Iicenses now? - Put that down. - Who's she? Don't even think about squatting here. I don't know where eIse to go! Sofa! FiII up your bag and then come see me. Is Yannick here? -Yannick? - Yannick M?nard. Oh, M?nard! No, not this morning. Do you know if he'II be in Iater? M?nard and scheduIes, weII... Do you know where I can reach him? Are you his mother? TeII him I dropped by. Yeah, teII him I dropped by. What do I say to him? TeII him that my watch... TeII him I'm ridicuIous. CompIeteIy ridicuIous. Gis?Ie? - HeIIo! - HeIIo. Is everything aII right? Is your offer to go fishing stiII open? More than ever. - When? - Now? -You mean...? - Now. I don't know if I can get away. Now. I'II see what I can do. There. A dry fly. That shouId do, for today. - It's hairy, eh? - I'm so happy! That's the way I am. I have to say what I feeI. Time goes way too fast not to. So I'II just say it: I feeI happy! This reaIIy is a nice corner of paradise. It's nice to be outdoors. And nice to be in nice company. That's a Iot of''nice''! No need to be so poIite. OK. - HoId on a second! - Yes? I'm not very- - No, you'II see. - My styIe is-- - It's simpIe. - OK. Ten to 10:00. - Ten past 2:00. - OK. Ten to 10:00, ten past 2:00. OK? Got it? Go ahead and cast. - Super! OK! Thanks. - Go ahead. OK. Ten to 10:00, ten past 2:00. Do you want to Iisten to the radio? If it's too windy on your side, we can turn the air-conditioning on. I can't apoIogize enough. Ten to ten, ten past two. I think I caught you somewhere around noon! I'm sorry! Caesar saIad and prosciutto and meIon for Madame. GriIIed sandwich for Monsieur. I've been wondering: Are you twins by any chance? Are you a waiter by any chance? Enjoy your meaI. CouIdn't think of anything sexier to say? Like what? ''Yes, I'm a twin. And I aIways wear the same coIours as my sister''? StiII sIeeping around? StiII sIeeping in yourflanneIs? I've got a new boyfriend. The bIind guy is history? - It's over. - Is he seeing someone eIse? I'm going out with a scuIptor from Madagascar. Is he the one doing your hair? There's no taIking to you today. Maybe I have better things to do than take time off to shop forfumiture for my mom with my sister who decided I had to take time off to shop forfumiture for my mom with my sister. We have to surprise her! We have to Iook after her. Find stuff for her to do. We're her caregivers now, Louis. I found out a few things... One thing, actuaIIy. I'm Iistening. I'II teII you, but you have to promise me you won't cry. Go ahead. It's about Dad and Aunt Marjo. Oh, that! You didn't know? You mean, you did? One day when I wasn't supposed to be at home... I was. You knew? You knew, and you never toId me? That's not what twins do. Twins don't do that. I never suspected for a second that you knew. So we're not identicaI, and we don't have ESP. We're pretty shitty at this twin thing. Aunt Marjo just has to teII Mom now, that's aII. I'm not sure how she'II take it. She'II kiII her. After that, she'II take it just fine. Wait. I have to show you something. Are you teIIing me... ourfather is in a vacuum cIeaner bag? There were bits of Dad everywhere. On the furniture, on the rug, in the pIants! Are you teIIing me ourfather is in a vacuum cIeaner bag? Yes. And he's not aIone. There are coffee grounds... IittIe pieces of KIeenex, dust bunnies... You didn't change the bag before you vacuumed him up? No. I wasn't thinking straight. I can't stand to keep it at my pIace anymore. Last night, I thought I heard breathing noises. Coming from the bag. We'II take out aII the other stuff. We'II buy a new um. It aII has to be ready for the cottage. Did you know you need a permit to scatter ashes in a pubIic pIace? I couId so smoke right now. Mom? Mom! -Are you aII right? -Yes. Why? We heard sounds. Sounds? What sounds? Funny sounds. WeII, fancy that. Sounds. She Iooks awfuI. WeII... She is a widow. - Louisette, we're waiting for you! - Coming! Don't try to fix your hair! You'II just make it worse. I knew I had better things to do than take time off to shop forfumiture for my mom with my sister who decided I had to take time off to shop forfumiture for my mom with my sister! to shop forfumiture for my mom with my sister! HeIIo. Oh, it's you. Yes. No, I'm fine. Yes. Where are you? Urn sizes are two Iitres, a Iitre and a haIf, one Iitre, three-quarters of a Iitre, which is very popuIar, and a quarter of a Iitre, for smaIIer-sized peopIe. Did yourfather Ieave a Iot of ashes? Enough to fiII a vacuum cIeaner bag. One Iitre! That'II be perfect. Did you know they incinerate at 1200 degrees CeIsius for two and a haIf hours? Any bones that are Ieft over are ground up. Are you Iooking for an urn that bIends in with your d?cor? Or do you prefer something that stands out? WeII, was your father a styIish man? Not at aII! Not Dad! We make house caIIs, too. Don't you think he's cute? - What are you doing? - I'm shopping. We come across as a coupIe of schmucks! Yannick! Yannick! Your cottage is so awesome! No, no. I can't. I can't! I can't date a former cIient. I can't! That's just not done. They'II think it started when you were underage. I don't want to end up on the six o'cIock news! And I'm twice your age. And when I say ''twice''... I'm cheating a bit. So... Get in the car. I'II drive you to L?vis. Come on! Where's your mother, Louisette? I came to show her the thank-you cards for your father. They're stiII warm. I chose the picture of him at the cottage. The one where he's actuaIIy smiIing. And... I printed a few too many. But you can have them as keepsakes. The ''thank you'' is aII in goId, and inside-- What? No, I haven't toId her yet. No! Twice in one week was aIready a record. But twice in one day... I never noticed how beautifuI your eyes are. Liar. Once in your office you said: ''Why do you IittIe troubIemakers aIways have the nicest eyes?'' I said that? I'm going to end up on the news. - For two? -Yes. Sit wherever you Iike. I'II be back with the menus. Damn, you're beautifuI. You're not so bad yourseIf. Hey... next Friday is my birthday. How oId wiII you be? 21? 22? 20. You'II come. Sure, I'II check my caIendar. No. You'II come. It's an aII day and aII night thing. Are you going to have anything to eat? Not coming in? You know, the oIder you get, the more attention you need. You need tenderness. You need a speciaI touch. Everyone wiII understand that you needed a young Iover... ...with more energy. Come inside! I Iove you. And I have for a Iong time. Can't he hear the racket he's making? I'II go teII him. You'II stay right here. I'II introduce myseIf. No! He aIready knows you. It's Laurent. Laurent? From your office? Anyone home? Go hide. Quick! Fuck. Hi! You finaIIy decided to come back to the cottage? Yeah. I think it's been a good three years now. And I think you've been working on yours for 20! The oIder things get, the more attention they need. They need a speciaI touch. I use my days off to fix up the pIace. I use mine to reIax. -Are you aIone? - Yes, why? Fred didn't happen to Ieave a 5/8'' driII bit Iying around? I'm putting in the braces for the oars on my new boat... My screws are aII 5/8''. I was sure I bought 3/4'' screws, but when I opened the box, I saw they gave me 5/8'' screws instead. My driII onIy has 1/8'', 3/8'', 3/4'', 1/4'', 1/2''... But no 5/8''. I have to put the wood in tonight. I aIready appIied the gIue. Pine gIue. It's made from pine... Sawdust with reaIIy strong gIue. Sorry, you'II have to forgive me. I'm starting to get chiIIy. And don't teII me about aII the different kinds of heaters. In my opinion, the best heaterfor a woman is a man's arm. Where are you going exactIy? - Can I heIp you? - No, I'm fine. Make yourseIf right at home. A5/8''. You have a IittIe cIeaning up to do. WeII... The onIy thing Ieft for a man to do on a Saturday night... is watch a Iate movie. I'II have to put Emmanuelle 12 on again. Right, because ''Gis?Ie 52'' is on herway to bed. You're breaking my heart. Just use some pine gIue. What's that? Laurent! Hi. What's he doing in your bedroom? - It's not what you think. - ReaIIy? What shouId I think? Think what you Iike. The office is one thing. Private Iife is another. Don't want to mix them, eh? I won't forget this, goddammit. - You did that on purpose! - I didn't! You did! HoId on... are you ashamed of me? When I saw you at the grocery store, I knew your husband had just died. I went Iooking for you everywhere because I wanted to make you feeI better. The timing is aII wrong. When wiII it be right? Laurent! You know as weII as I do some cIients become dependent on us. You don't take them them up to your cottage! And certainIy not up to your bedroom! - Have there been others before him? - What are you impIying? Do you know what you're doing? He tried to kiII himseIf at 17! For Iove! That kid is stiII vuInerabIe. - What kind of game is this? - He's an aduIt! Your Iogic is impeccabIe. So every time one of our girIs turns 18, I'II jump her bones. Cut it out! Hey, Yannick! You forget to get undressed before you took a shower? We have to taIk to you about something. You're acting aII weird. Can't this wait? I'm soaking wet. It can't wait. No. No. It can't wait. See... We know things that nobody... Stuff. Spit it out! What things and stuff? Go ahead. You teII him. Why do I have to be the one to taIk to him? Because it's you. I aIways do these things. Why me? Because. Because you can. I'm not interested. Go after him. Yannick! We're friends, right? Fucking idiots! Why don't you guys go after him? Maybe you couId consider earIy retirement. My job is my Iife. CIearly. You even take it with you to the cottage. Ourfriend M?nard... is just another screwed-up kid who needs attention. EmotionaI probIems. Don't we aII have some? Substance abuse. OnIy a IittIe. KIeptomania. That's stiII a big probIem. After he gets your attention, in about two or three weeks, he'II dump you. Like the things he steaIs to make Iife more interesting. You want to ignore the facts, eh? Mind you, you've aIways tumed a bIind eye to things. What does that mean? Nothing. But if the M?nard kid comes up just once more, you're out of here. I'm coming to find a new skirt. I want to be pretty for your birthday. What do you want for a gift? For you to find somewhere eIse to hang. Where are your skirts? Back there. Way back there. Take Charest BouIevard to Parc des Laurentides and head to Chibougamau. So funny. Hey, Naomie! Keep an eye on the pIace for an hour and a haIf. ExceIIent vaIue. Code two! It's no big deaI. He tried to steaI a guitar. He asked for you. Don't you work with juveniIes? I'II take care of it. Thank you. I'II vouch for him. I didn't know who to caII. That's my sociaI worker. She must be working on somebody's case. I hope it's not mine. I haven't had my hearing yet. Mrs. CIoutier? It's Yannick's girIfriend! Yannick's girIfriend is here! Yannick, come here! It's your party! Not again! We're aIready aII sticky! Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you... Wow!Aflute! He'II Iove it! It's not a... - Do I know you? - I'm Naomie. You're so young. I'm onIy a year younger than he is. Don't take it personaIIy, but... I reaIIy don't get what he sees in you. I'II try not to take it personaIIy. To get him back, shouId I draw some wrinkIes on my face? He tried to kiII himseIf for me. That's fucking huge! I'm not sure he'd do that for you. You came! Fuck! I'm happy you're here! You're wearing the dress! I don't even know how to pIay. Is something wrong? - Oh heIIo, Mrs. CIoutier. - Mrs. M?nard. Gis?Ie! Mom? Oh, wow! The two women of my Iife! CooI. You're both so beautifuI! Is he in troubIe again? - Gis?Ie! - Yannick... You need to teII me right now what you've done to Mrs. CIoutier. What's going on? Gis?Ie! Here. It's freshIy stoIen. Go, man. Yannick is head over heeIs in Iove with Mrs. CIoutier. - HeIIo. - HeIIo. Wow! You Iook nice. Thank you. I miss Dad. There's not one picture of the two of you in here. Where were you? I was busy making a Iiving. Busy waiting for yourfather who was never around. Busy heIping young deIinquents out of hot water, so they couId go right back in. I meant tonight. Where were you? At Marjo's. That's good. Because she's Iooking for you, too. She wants to go with you tomorrow. To the cottage. For the ashes. Right. I Iike the Iamp. Things are Iooking a Iot younger around here. You weren't Iooking for me to teII me that. How oId is he? What? I found these the other day. Do what you want. But nobody's going to hurt my mother. Not even you. Marjo... I have to taIk to you. I'm Iistening. Have you ever been crazy in Iove? I mean crazy to the point of Iosing aII controI? AIove that makes no sense. AIove where aII the odds are against you. The more you struggIe against it, the deeper you sink. And you know that it's not right... that it's ridicuIous. And you teII yourseIf it has to stop. But you don't want it to stop. Because... ...it's that good! And you feeI guiIty. Do you have anything to drink? Sure, there's... a bit of scotch and a bit of whisky. Both. I'II have both. OK. Hey, Iook at that! The twins are here! I'm so, so happy to see you! - HeIIo! - Hi, Aunt Marjo! - I brought the ashes. - The what? Dad's ashes. No, that's meatIoaf. Why did you bring up Dad right away? I didn't. I was taIking about his ashes. We brought food. I'm making rice, with coconut miIk and pork in cassava Ieaves. It's a dish from Madagascar. Yes, I'm back with the scuIptor. The meatIoaf is his way of asking forforgiveness. Did you have a fight with these? There was this strange gust of wind out of nowhere. Like it was trying to teII you something? Yeah, Iike that. I don't know what it wanted. Maybe it was teIIing you that you have something to say to someone. I'm not sure. So... What we're going to do is put the sieve here, Iike this. I'm going to grab you Iike this. And when I turn you over, we're going to push together, you and me, OK? What are you doing? You startIed me! - Who were you taIking to, Louis? - Dad. He's in the bag. Don't teII Mom! There was an accident and I had to vacuum him up. I'm not crazy enough to teII your mother that. Right. Me neither. Come heIp us! I'II just wash my hands first. Antoine Lewis? He... ...seIIs hunting products. He came to the funeraI parIour. Th?r?se Robichaud? We're not doing the bios of everyone he ever knew, are we? Sorry. Here I am. AII inside? On such a IoveIy day? CouId I have a toweI, Gis?Ie? Never mind. I know where they are. Nice boxers. Who's that? Aformer cIient. What is one of yourformer cIients doing at our cottage? He has a Iot of probIems. He... He has no respect... for boundaries. That's it. No respect for boundaries. And... WeII, it's a form of... a kind of... a type of... How can I put it? Yes, it's... a kind of rejection of sociaI pressures. That's it. It's rejection. So... I guess... You must be the twins? You're the twin sister and... You're the twin brother. He catches on quick. And you're Marjo, her sister. Those are Dad's cIothes! Sure, you can caII me Dad if you want to. I'm sorry, Mom, but... how does ''Mr. Rejection'' want us to caII him? Dad. Gis?Ie, don't you have something you want to teII them? We stiII don't know what he's doing here. And don't you have something to say to Mom? I need time. You've had enough time. Right.
