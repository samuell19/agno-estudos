(tape clicking) (upbeat music) (hand slapping) (melancholy music) - You know, every stripper needs a great nickname. I thought about calling myself Starlight, 'cause just like you, I came here with stars in my eyes. - Starlight? - And I thought about Miss Moonlight because I have such a great ass. (hand slapping) And you know what? I could still go with that. - So why Goldie then? - My dog, he's the only family member I have that hasn't been in jail. Goldie was my good luck charm. Always kept out of trouble. - Your whole family's in jail? - Dad's a lifer. And my mom just got busted for selling pharmaceuticals to my thief sister and now they're sharing a cell. - Sorry to hear that. - I'm not, that's three less people I don't shop for come Christmas. How about you? Family out here? - Daddy died in a fire. Momma gets her kicks putting herself in harm's way, booze, drugs, whatever else. Didn't feel like keeping her company in hell, so I came out here. - Linda, we're trying to come up with a good nickname for Megan. - Keep it short, keep it sweet, like me. - I was thinking about calling myself the Lioness. - Um, I was thinking more along the lines of Bambi. - Bambi, like the deer? - Girl, you ain't no lioness. - I can be whatever I wanna be. - Why Lioness? - Because they eat snakes and shit, and they're sexy and powerful. - Lighten up there, sunshine, you're a sweetheart, you can work that innocence like it's a magical power. You're not a lioness. How about Bunny? - Bunny? - How about Sweetling? That was my last boyfriend's pet name for me. - Sweetling? Sounds like something I would eat with chicken and dumplings. - Okay, let me think about it. Dallas Star. You're from Texas, right? - No, I'm from Transylvania. - Then how about Count Breastula? - I've come to the conclusion that I hate people, not just Goldie or anyone else specifically, just anyone that isn't me. These types of conversations are one of those reasons why. You know what, I think I'm just going to go with Megan. - Using your real name is bad luck in this business? I remember this girl's grandpa tracked her down and shot up the place. - Yeah, well there's no one out there looking for me. - Always better to use a fake name. I heard that there's this stripper, she goes from club to club, stays there a little bit, robs the place. No one knows who the hell she is. - [Child] Can you help me? - [Linda] Yeah, let's see, what's going on here? - [Child] I need you to help me with the maths. - [Linda] Okay, all right, so let's look at this, three, eight, so what's our answer? - Eight. - [Linda] Yeah, good job. - [Child] Got 100%. - Hey, how's life? - Life is a bucket of shit with a barbed wire handle. - Easy, what's wrong? - Got a term insurance policy just in case, you know, something happens to me my kid's covered. - Nice. - He'll get a quarter of a million if I die within the next 10 years. - [Goldie] Cool. - I may be more of a help to him dead than alive. - Are you sure nothing else is wrong? - [Linda] I'm fine. - Okay, no worries. - I borrowed money from Anna. - You didn't? - I didn't have enough to pay for the attorneys, ended up losing my son anyway. - How much? - Too much. - You'll get it together. - Do we have any envelopes around here? - Um, check upstairs, I think I have some in my closet. - [Linda] Thanks. (dramatic music) (zipper opening) (notes rustling) (zipper closing) - Sometimes when you witness somebody doing wrong, it's best not to take the high road. When you're in the jungle you have to let a snake be a snake. (zipper closing) - [Female] Leave me alone. - [Male] What do you mean just leave you alone? - [Female] I don't wanna talk to you. - [Male] What you talking about? - [Female] I don't care anymore. I work, I work, I vacuum, I dry, I clean the windows. - [Male] You work on nothing, you work on your hair that's what you work on. - [Female] I don't care about that. (pulsing music) (gun clicking) - [Female] I don't know. (gun banging) (fire crackling) (gun clicking) - Megan? - Jesus, don't you knock? - Gino's downstairs waiting. - I'll walk over to the club. - Are you serious? - Yeah, I've got an errand to run. - Gino can take you. - I'll be fine. - You know what happens if you're late? (notes rustling) (cellphone ringing) - Mr. Kavanagh? I understand. Yeah, of course. It's not going to happen again. You will have the money tonight I promise you. Again I apologize. (cellphone slamming) (sighs) (cellphone ringing) Gino? - Yeah, just dropped them off. - [Anna] Is everybody here? - [Gino] Everyone except Megan. - Looks like someone has been stealing money from the till. - No way. - Do you have any idea who it might be? - Could be anyone. - Anyone? - I don't know. Girls come, girls go. - If it were Goldie, would you tell me? - Yeah, she wouldn't do that. - I see. - You don't think... - I have someone else in mind. - [Megan] Shit. - You're late. - I'm sorry. - [Anna] That you are. - This is Anna, our boss, probably didn't notice the danger alligator woman sign outside the club door. I'm sorry, I just lost track of time. - Where were you? - Out running errands. - Where? The swamps? You're tracking dirt onto my floor. - Oops. - You've been late a lot lately. - Just today. - And yesterday, and the day before. - Won't happen again. - You're just saying that to tickle my earlobes. - I'm not. - Remember, Megan, people who break the rules are the first to find out why there are rules. - There are nights that will change everything. Nights that tell you that the devil is going to get his money's worth. - I don't have to tell you that business is down. - [Megan] But another 10% per day? - Dance more, work harder. - [Megan] It's not fair. - Fair? I think you might need a little attitude adjustment. - No, I don't, I'm just tired of smelling your farts. - [Goldie] Megan? - Goldie, do you want to tell Megan how I lost my finger? - She's new, she doesn't know any better. - When I was in Basra, the militia came into the village and made everybody sit in the dirt face first. They attacked us with clubs and knives. They beat and cut my people to death. They found my mother holding me in her arms. They told her to bite off my finger. If she didn't do it, they'd kill us. Mom didn't hesitate. So you see when it comes to listening to a disgruntled dancer complain about what's fair, well, yeah. - I'm just saying. - You don't want life to be fair. I want bitches that want to get more than their fair share. So you either going to sit here and feel sorry for yourself or you're going to get out there and shake that ass. Do that to someone who's actually gonna give you money. (slow erotic music) - I had high hopes of opening a chain of nail salons. I wanted to be able to go back home and tell everybody, see, I told you so. Stripping wasn't a part of the plan, at least not at first. (birds squawking) Yes, I'm out sneaking in a cigarette like a damn 13 year old because the boss lady doesn't allow it. Fuck her. Let's go see what these bitches are up to. (zipper opening) - Looks like two grand is missing. - Do you think someone stole it? - I don't think, I know. - It wasn't me. - Who was it then? - I don't know. - Playing dumb with me isn't smart. - Okay, but everyone who works here is really sketch so. - You know when I look into your eyes in the right light, they seem black. - I've never lied to you. - All you strippers lie like an Oriental rug. - I don't. - You're a single mom stripping at night. Your little boy needs things. - I've never... - Desperate girls do desperate things. - I'm not desperate, and I'm not a damn thief. - You need extra money to send to your son, right? - Yeah. - Then what a coincidence, I have a job for you. (zipper opening) (notes rustling) (zipper closing) Don't fuck it up. - [Megan] Goldie! - What is it, I only have 20 minutes. - Did you see and Linda talking? - Yeah, I see that every night since we all work here. - No, but did you notice anything suspicious about them? - Nope, they're their usual Girl Scout selves. - Well I don't trust them. They were talking about us, about me. - What were they talking about? - Money. - And? - They think one of us is a thief. - [Goldie] What did they say? - I don't know, I didn't catch it all. My hearing's gone out because being by that bass all damn night, but it was something about someone stealing money. - Did you steal any money? - No. - Oh, then you have nothing to worry about. And as your mentor, watch your mouth around Anna. She's like one of those Satanic goats. She wears heels to hide her hoofs. - [Megan] Well I don't trust any of them. - Trust me, not everyone's out to get you, country girl. - As you can see, strippers are a mysterious and ancient peoples prone to lying and subterfuge. Sensitive and poetic souls like me, we don't belong here. (moaning) (slow instrumental music) - I love your hairy chest. Do you ever think about taking a razor and making designs? - No. - Would you mind if I try? - What kind of design would you make? - I don't know, a dollar sign. - Not a heart? - Give me a razor and I'll give it a try. - You know what I'm thinking? - I never know what's going on in that head of yours. - I'm thinking we should make this permanent. - Gino. - You love me, don't you? - Let's just say you're my favorite dish on the menu. - So I'm better than the pie? (laughing) Gosh, your hair is just, it's like something straight out of a shampoo ad. - Stop. - I mean, I'm not saying we should get married. We don't have to get married, just, you know, we'd be together permanently. - I like my freedom. - Why can't we have our freedom together? - Just doesn't work that way. - It can work any way if we want it to. We can get out of here, we can disappear. - I don't want to disappear. It's like those sinkholes we get when it rains. I read that centuries ago, this whole area was covered by glaciers that left ice deep inside the earth. And eventually that ice melted and ate away at the sandstone and created these deep caverns. So when it rains hard, really, really hard, the ground will just collapse. And if you're standing in the wrong place you'll fall so deep down that no one will ever find you ever. - What you trying to say? - I'm saying that if you don't have money, you die in a sinkhole. - I have money. I'm not gonna say how much. I came into some cash. - How much money can you save by working at the club? - Let's just say I came into some money. - Really? - Yeah. So how much would it take, how much would it take to give you your freedom? - Let me think about it. - Shh, Linda's in there talking to Anna. - [Goldie] So? - So, something's up, I told you so. - She's probably just collecting her pay for the week, since she wasn't here last night. - No, I'm only catching snippets of it. But Anna's giving Linda extra just to run some money. - [Goldie] What? - Yes, something about the courier being held up? I don't know, Anna's giving Linda extra cash though just to deliver some money bags. That's not fair. - She's got seniority. - Whatever. (intense music) (door clicking) - [Gino] Linda, you wanna give me a hand over here? - Yeah, coming. (door clicking) - Don't do that. - Do what, what's that? - Come on. (high-paced music) - Slow down. That's the number one rule of the jungle, you have to know what these reptiles are going to do before they do it, like sticking their neck out for you so you don't have to. - [Gino] Something wrong? - It's gone. - What's gone? - I laid it right here not even a minute ago. - You're not making any sense. - Tonight's deposit, somebody took it. - [Gino] I've gotta tell Anna. - Don't. - Okay, well where is it? - I'll find it. (fast-paced music) - What are you doing? (screaming) - [Megan] What is going on? - I'll tell you back at the house. Come on. (moaning) - You see this smile, this is manager of the year smile, because you know when your boss gives you this smile shit's about to hit the fan. - No, I don't know. - You stole from me. - You told me to go deposit it. - Okay, where is it? - I don't have it. - Why are you doing this? - Doing what? - Pissing me off. - [Linda] Please don't. (crying) - You know, if I cut your eye out, it's going to hurt you more than me, right. - She took it from me. - Who? - Goldie, I laid it down for not even a moment and she must've ran off with it. - Listen, you'd better start telling the truth or I'm going to kill you with my bare fucking hands. - I am telling you the truth, I swear. That's why I'm out here looking for it. - I believe you. (knife swiping) (moans) Consider this a preview of what will happen to you if you don't find the fucking money. (crying) She claims Goldie stole it, you know what to do. Get your ass up. Up! Fix the problem. Go! (seagulls squawking) - Goldie! - Just keep running. - [Megan] Where are we going? - To find buried treasure. - The old me would have felt like a mark following a femme fatale in one of those old film noirs my grandfather used to watch. I felt like that a lot of the times in my life like watching my whole life play out in expressionistic black and white, doomed to a bad ending. Are you going to tell me why we're running? And here did that come from? - Guess. - You didn't? - I know I shouldn't have, but I couldn't help it. I mean, how much could it be anyway? She should make the same money we do. - Jesus, really, I swear every time I'm with you I feel like a criminal, now I really am one. - Oh stop. - You know what, I've gotta pee. - We don't have that much far to go. - Well I can't hold it anymore. (seagulls squawking) (cellphone bleeping) - Fuck off, bitch. - You never answer my calls. You know, when you run off into the woods you're supposed to leave a trail of breadcrumbs. - Goldie? - [Linda] I can't say this is a surprise. I always knew you two were sketch. - Ease up, Linda. There's enough money here for all of us. - [Linda] Oh, spare me, you're such a fake. - I stole for all of us. - [Linda] Of course you did. - Just give her the money, okay? - I am not even going to count to three. - Be cool, Linda. - You know, I had it real good around there until you two came around. Can't say it's been my pleasure. (groaning) - [Megan] Go. (coughing) (seagulls squawking) (door banging) (sighing) - You're really willing to turn your life upside down just for a few dollars? - Good point, but I have this impulse control problem. Tonight an opportunity presented itself. I'm only human. - You know, it looks like more than just a week's pay. - Maybe it's all ones. (zipper opening) Holy shit. (elastic band cracking) There must be five grand here. - [Megan] What was Linda doing with that kind of money? - [Goldie] The night receipts for the club, I don't know. - There's no way we bring in that much. - $35,000, 50 maybe. - [Megan] I got a bad feeling about this. - Me too. - [Megan] Well return it. - Do you really think Anna's just gonna forgive us for stealing? - No, not even on a good day. - There's no turning back. Pack your bags, we'll catch a bus, and get the hell out of here. - Oh wait, I haven't done anything wrong. - If you're so certain, stay. You know, maybe Anna will even forgive you for stealing. Personally, I wouldn't take that chance. (intense music) (zipper opening) (doors clicking) (zipper opening) (zipper closing) (door banging) (sinister drum music) Megan? Megan? (door slamming) Gino. - What have you done, Goldie? - I know, I screwed up. - You don't get it. These aren't the type of people that you mess with. - Anna, she's all bark. - It goes far deeper than Anna. Haven't you ever wondered about the nightly deposits? They're not protecting what little bit of cash the club makes every night. - Oh my God. - Large amounts are brought in every morning to go out with the nightly deposits. You understand? - What should I do? - Anna wants that money back. Turn it in, she might let you live. But that's the least of your problems. The deposit is late, Kavanagh knows. - We're packing, Megan and me. If we have to run we might as well keep the money. - We can run away together, because I'm the one that's been stealing the money. - You? - I did it for us. You know, if we combine what I have, and what you just stole... - How much? - Tip of the iceberg? - Holy shit. - So now let's go and... - Disappear? - If you don't come with me, I'm going to die. - Let me grab my bag. (gun fires) - No, wait. (Goldie crying) - Don't, they'll catch you. - We're gonna be so great together. - We already are. (Goldie crying) - Why? - I thought... - He was going to help us. - Sorry. - Sorry? That's all you have to say? (Goldie sobbing) (hand slapping) - Okay, okay, okay, get it together. Grab your bags. (seagulls squawking) Why did you have to go and kill him, Megan? Shit. - I thought he was there to kill us. - Where the hell did you get the gun? You think you know your roommate better than that. - I never said I didn't own a gun. - Yeah, and you never said you did. Way to screw up my life? - Your life, what about mine? This was all your fault, you know. So much for the nail salon. - Now everyone is out to kill us. - Maybe we should split the money, you know, in case one of us gets caught. - It's safe where it is. - If we're splitting it anyway, what's the difference? - If there's no difference, then there's no reason not to leave it alone. - [Anna] What happened? - Gino. - [Anna] I told you that working for me is either sink or swim. You're sinking more than swimming. - I know where they're going. - [Anna] Show me, Kavanagh's on his way, we can't let them leave with that money. - Kavanagh? (door clicking) - [Anna] Shit. - Looks like money's more powerful than love. (feet padding on carpet) - [Anna] They're gone. - Now what? - They don't have a car, so there's only one way off the island. (door banging) - Feels like somebody's watching us. (intense music) - I don't see anybody. - I've spent my whole life being watched, I know the feeling. Come here. - [Goldie] What the hell? (intense music) - I didn't realize how far the bus station was from the condo? - We shouldn't be more than a couple miles from the bus station. Megan? (leaves crunching) (water splashing) (bat banging) (moaning) - I bet you didn't even realize how stupid this was. - Megan's out, we can split it the both of us. - Split it? Oh no, I'm not spending the rest of my life looking over my shoulder. - Linda, we're all fish swimming in the same dirty water. We can get out, both of us, disappear. - No thanks. And I'll be sure to let Anna know who to thank for all the trouble. (knife thudding) (moaning) - Why? - I don't like loose ends. (knife thudding) (moaning) And as for you... (door clicking) Mr. Kavanagh, yes, the money's ready for pickup. (phone banging) (door squeaking) (intense music) (door clicking) (door clicking) (moaning) (banging) (coughing) A backstabber can never be trusted. - We can work this out. - You see this smile, this is my crazy lady smile. And you know what crazy ladies do when they get pissed? - They shit themselves. - They do that. (slapping) (crying) - You know, I always thought you were a little underage to be such an old witch. - Your poker face sucks. - Take the money, you'll never see me again. - But I won't be able to sleep a wink until I see you covered in blood. - You crazy bitch. - My psychiatrist didn't diagnose me as crazy, but I reckon he was wrong. - No. (thudding) (gun banging) Megan, we can work this out. Split the money, you have your down payment for the salon. I took you in when no one else would. I got you a job at the club. - I saw this animal show once about this lioness who had enough of the pecking order. - Show a little appreciation here. - She got tired of all the males eating first, and leaving the females to fight for the scraps. (gun bangs) So she takes the pride by surprise, kills all the males and females one by one. (bag rustling) (crickets chirping) (door clicking) I felt the jungle wind stroke my hair, another strip club was opening up in a town over. I could smell the potential. Smell the money. Smell the fresh meat, like a lioness. (upbeat music)
