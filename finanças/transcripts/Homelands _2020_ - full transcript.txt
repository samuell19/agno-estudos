Nothing Is Here Yet, But A Form Can Already Match It Homelands Last year, around February, we had an incident up in the mountain. Some mountaineers came, from Skopje, two mountaineering clubs. And they set off, there was a storm. They didn’t listen to us: the visibility was really low, just a few feet. It was snowing the entire day, a meter of snow fell in just one hour. They weren’t really well-equipped, from what I could tell. I was just here when they first arrived. They headed up to the church. And on their way back from the church two of them got lost. So instead of coming back to the ski center they got stuck somewhere behind the mountain. Their club didn’t provide this information on time so they weren’t reported as missing until after two hours, give or take. We first started looking for them by the phone and we found out, through our army’s transmitter that they were stuck somewhere at the steep part of the mountain in the direction of Macedonia, Skopje, of Bitola in fact. For a while, they were answering the phone, the girl did. This guy who works for the rescue team went down to look for them. But because of the storm, the fog, he was unable to get them. So he went to the other side, and then he found them. But the girl was already... she already froze to death. Then he found the guy, he started shaking him but he was already hallucinating from the cold. When the rescuer tried to reach him, the guy pushed him, slipped and fell. And the hardest part was the next day when this young man’s father came Aleksandar was his name I think He says: “Is my son dead?” – “Yes, he is” I say. Then he asks me: “Are you sure?” Here, I remember, in 1947, there were partisans in the village. Actually, the soldiers were in the village and the partisans would come from outside and attack the army here. In ’47 there was army in this village, and the people from the mountain used to come, hit them, the army, and go back to the mountains. That was in 1946-’47. Here, at the foot of the mountain the army would attack with machine guns and then the partisans would come down and attack... Our army, all around the mountain, had the machine guns but the guys from the mountain used to come kill the army and go back again. Antartes, you know. The illegal warriors. In ’47-’48 there was illegal movement across the mountains. There was army here so the soldiers fought the partisans in the mountains... Then the army went to the mountains and finish the illegals. From ’47 to ’48 this was. Some of the accused ones were taken away and killed. Who did that? - I don’t know exactly who... He says he doesn’t remember who did that but some kind of army was coming here, took some of our men and just killed them. But he doesn’t remember who they were. It was war then... It was war. Mixed things. I refuse, I refuse, I refuse To let the others hold the reigns I refuse to let them do whatever they want I refuse to drown in the fog I refuse to let them do whatever they want I refuse to drown in the fog I refuse, I refuse, I refuse To let you be, while I'm not When you dictate my life With my earth and my water When you dictate my life With my earth and my water I refuse, I refuse, I refuse To see that the road is always closed for me I refuse to have my opinion silenced To wait in vain for the right time I refuse to have my opinion silenced To wait in vain for the right time I refuse, I refuse, I refuse To let the others hold the reigns I refuse to let them do whatever they want I refuse to drown in the fog I refuse to let them do whatever they want I refuse to drown in the fog I refuse, I refuse, I refuse To let you be, while I'm not When you dictate my life With my earth and my water When you dictate my life With my earth and my water I refuse, I refuse, I refuse To see that the road is always closed for me I refuse to have my opinion silenced To wait in vain for the right time I refuse to have my opinion silenced To wait in vain for the right time I refuse, I refuse, I refuse To let the others hold the reigns I refuse to let them do whatever they want I refuse to drown in the fog I refuse to let them do whatever they want I refuse to drown in the fog! You’re hungry, aren’t you... Over there too... Good job! Eat this too, here... Eat it... Oh, you rascal! Here... Here, this too... Go on! We are going to prepare 20 apples... ... to fill the pan. I’ll do it slowly so you can catch up, we don’t want them to turn brown... With apples, you need to be quick. And then... we’ll fill the pan and add sugar and cinnamon and cloves, to make them smell nice... And then we’ll put them in the stove. Not an oven, but a stove. The traditional way... And whoever tries them, will come back for more... Straighten the wheel! Straighten it! A bit to the left! Left! Turn left, left! Go on, go on! Straighten it! Straighten it! TO COMRADE TITO ZEMUN FOR LIFE The change of weather comes with the wind there is this precise moment as the summer reaches its end when something in the air changes sometimes I think you can get this feeling only in the places you call home the change of seasons is seen as unavoidable if only it were like that with social systems too after the summer leaves remain on the ground after the change of social systems ruins remain ruins our world will become so hot it’s always going to be summer the scorching, killing summer I imagine our world disappearing I wish I could say slowly but not really and so I think that in a little while we are all going to disappear in the fire of the sun now this wind that announces the fall gently bends the grass it sprouts from the walls foundation backyard of a house there’s a tree around and the secret life of plants goes on a woman who used to live here became the most important woman to me ruins there were people and there was war someone was killed someone escaped people left and the houses collapsed from sorrow ruins are monuments built by the nature the patrimony of communists who used to live here sometimes I think that the war against nature is somehow also a reckoning with communism the trees actually live the communism they understand the equal distribution of resources and goods through their roots they know that they will grow and live together as a forest if everyone has what they need not if one branches out so that it suffocates the others trees and forests know that resources have to be nourished and shared justly they know the thrill and the beauty but also the perfect peace dead soldiers wounded in German offensives are the proof dead youth whose bed is now forest moss lives interrupted and unburied in human rites the forest took them all in they merged with it blended with the moss the trees the grass and now as these beeches and oaks stand tall somewhere in their leaves dead partisans are rustling trees hid my grandmother when it was rough and when her father was killed when she fought for a better world and for capitalists to drop dead trees hid many other women like her they flutter for them and sing keep them cool when it’s hot hide them from the stalking eyes tell them stories with their hidden tongue about the beauty of the equal distribution of goods all this today that’s revenge against trees because they know about communism I sat on a clearing in the forest and the forest talked to me about her about her father’s death and how she said she was leaving to be a refugee in socialism whatever happened to her afterwards we always wondered she looked like you except for that silly board she had a real gun which she used to hunt grouses for the wounded before falling asleep she would say that our roots make the best pillow and we would laugh at her charming lies she used to sing lullabies to me she caressed my cheek when I was little she taught me Greek she learned that from us, the forest said if she misses a note we drop an acorn on the ground and she sings it right that’s why she sang so lovely to you you sing lovely too and really you look like her except for that silly board I left the forest and I was thinking how the female line of continuity of history and politics is passed through lullabies take this woman remembered still by these ruins and this forest she fought for something for emancipation, for socialism and then in a socialist country she spent her lifetime in patriarchy and in this patriarchy she sang combat songs to me taught me a foreign language and the beauty of the collective that is how the song passed along the female line of combat that’s how the fighting spirit of women circulates the matter circulates through nature, basic laws of physics so you can’t have ideology or politics without guts the lines on a woman’s face are born out of desire for justice I seem like a young woman and the superficial eye never sees that I am made of old women a perfectly arranged collage of old women makes up my skin, organs and spirit they made me I owe them everything I am without them I would never even consider rebellion I wouldn’t know the language of the forest or the emotion of the ruins I would have been more fearful and more scared of life and so here I’m learning to snowboard in a ski center made upon ruins of my grandmother’s house I feel the wind in my hair I soak in the air of my grandmother’s childhood and her revolutionary years as the chill bites and freezes my eyes the mountain the ruins and I talk and dance together it’s a dance of memory and strength a dance with the fight in its steps a dance that reminds us of the women who fought right here and now behind that hill a river of women is gathering still out of reach of the human eye snow falcons that you can’t see yet who, as falcons do, will soon come soaring down against all the world’s injustice it’s right there the river of women that’s just about to flow through the mountains riding a snowboard and not giving a fuck the river of women is taking over the world powerful and terrifying, unstoppable, destructive she is coming down the slope and behind them forests are rising up snow falcons on boards carrying everything on their way the last judgment by the women and the nature poetic justice taking its shape wiping capitalism off the face of the earth no more unpaid home labor derelict hospitals and unnecessary deaths destroyed rivers and burned down forests or eternal desire for profit before them the senseless capital accumulators are trembling all of them who calmly sent so many people into the ground who took pleasure in other man’s hunger seized the power uncontrollably all of them the women, and I with them, we just smile it’s a smile of sweet revenge and poetic justice justice that is coming helmed by the women and the forest and behind them the masses of the hungry, the sad, the dispossessed, the rugged and now let the world’s injustice tremble let the poetic justice sing!
