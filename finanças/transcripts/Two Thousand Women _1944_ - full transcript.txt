"You have been listening to dance music by Coriano and his Pampas Serenaders. Here is Coriano." "Good night, everybody. Me and the boys'll be with you again Saturday." "This is the BBC Home and Forces Programme. Here is the news and this is John Snagge reading it." "The latest news about the fighting in France was given..." Est-ce que Paris est tombe? Pas encore, ils sont a 20km. "To the west, new German forces have attacked south of Rouen." "Motorised armoured columns have begun to pour over the bridgeheads of Louviers, Andelys and Vernon... ...towards Poissy and Evreux." Encore une? Nous I'avons prise en train de faire des signaux a un avion ennemi. "The communique went on to say..." Alors, qu'avez-vous a dire? Excusez-moi. Mon Francais n'est pas tres bon - I'm English. English? Vous entendez? Elle dit qu'elle est anglaise. Why do so many of you dress as nuns? So many? I'm a novice from the Convent of St Antoine at Montard. That's 100km away. We're evacuating south on a train it's been held up. Where is this train? In the forest, about 6km away. They're repairing the track. What were you doing at the top of St Clous hill? The children were hungry. Some of us went to find food. Show me your papers. Mother Superior has all our papers. I have heard 20 such stories in the past few days. I'm telling you the truth. What part of England are you from? London. Hmm... Donnez-moi cette lampe! If you don't believe me, send someone to the railway. If there was anything wrong it would be reported here. You were signalling to the enemy. I was trying to find out where I was. A German plane was passing overhead and there happens to be an ammunition dump 100 metres away! But you wouldn't know that! This torch was made in Austria. If I can find you a priest, I will do so. Enlevez-la! Halt! Abtreten! Comme vous voulez, Mon capitaine, allez-y. Wer ist das Madchen? Warum ist sie hier? Goodbye, Fraulein. Goodbye. Hello. Hello. You for the internment camp? Yes. Pass right down the car, then. Plenty of room here. Did they arrest you during a musical comedy?! No, they're from a French army stores; my clothes are being cleaned. My name's Freda Thompson, what's yours? Rosemary Brown. We haven't met before, have we? No, I don't think so. Your face strikes a chord. Do I exist? Unfortunately! Bridie Johnson - known to males in Paris as Bubbles. Married, divorced, married and divorced again. Did I miss one? I'd like to strangle you. Ignore us. We shared, for six months, a bug-ridden dump. I would have gladly poisoned her! Imagine having to listen to the uncensored version of her love life. For six months I've listened to her talk like the muck she wrote. Her smack at my career. Subsister on a rag - some career! I place that above a twice-nightly stripper in a third-rate music hall. Forget her. What did you do? Me? Nothing, really. You must have done something. If she doesn't want to tell us, it's her affair. We're ready now, my man. Come along, chaps. Surely this is not the conveyance? I'm afraid it is, Muriel. Oh! I shall write to the Red Cross about this. Remember, Celeste, the key goes to Monsieur Leclerc. 0ui, madame. No tears, Celeste. I cannot help it, madame. Nonsense. Goodbye, Celeste. Well, goodbye, Celeste. Thank you for all you've done for us. Merci, Dubois. Je suis desolee que nous devions nous quitter ainsi. Look after her, Celeste. Clare, please. Oh, good afternoon. Are you going to Marneville, too? Yes. You'd better sit down before we turn a corner. Thank you. Sit here, Clare. Have you got the rugs? Yes. Muriel Manningford, Clare Meredith. Freda Thompson, Bridie Johnson and Rosemary Brown. We're all British, I take it? Mrs Johnson has a British passport. Amounts to the same thing. It gets her to the same place. It's a comfort to be with countryfolk. We were confined indoors. If only we'd taken my brother's... Don't chatter so, Clare! We were in a delightful little cell, 10ft under the ground. Dreadful! There was life there. I think we brought some with us! You poor things, but Marneville is quite a pleasant little spa. We went there to take the waters. You'll get bread with them this time "Tickets for Red Cross parcels for internees in blocks C and D... ...will be issued in the office at four o'clock today." Hello there! Welcome to Holloway. What's it like? Sheets? Yeah. Heating? No. Food? Stinks! Enough! Leave your luggage and follow me. See you later. "Internees can obtain blue cards on Wednesday between 10 and 11." Ansicht, bitte. Heil Hitler! Heil Hitler. Unteroffizier mit funf Internierten zur Stelle! Na endlich ich warte schon 'Ne Ewigkeit. You will be accommodated in block C. You will share rooms with others. This is limited to two per room. Manningford, Muriel. Answer, please! If we must sleep two in a room I'll share with Miss Meredith. The location of rooms is my business. I am not used to being spoken to so. Arrange that we share a room or I shall tell the Commandant... ...that a man your age and physique is better suited to the battlefield. Not sitting in an office making insulting remarks to women and... > Enough! Room 72, second floor. Miss Manningford and Miss Meredith. Thank you. Brown, Rosemary. Yes. Thompson, Freda. Yes. Hello. You will share room 68, floor two. I was afraid I'd get landed with Little Love Hungry. Johnson, Bridie! Could I have a room to myself? Internees may only occupy rooms on their own in exceptional cases. My case is exceptional - I talk in my sleep. I can't help it. Lots of people talk in their sleep. I'm thinking of the girl I'd have to share with. If I were alone... The rat's about to enter the trap after the oldest cheese in the world Well, is it really as bad as that? Of course, in some cases it might be. Oh, that's odd! It so happens that room 66 on floor two is vacant. That has a single bed, it's true... Thank you, Sergeant. That's the way the world goes round. Frau Holweg! Fuhren Sie sie in ihre Quartiere! Jawohl, Herr Wachtmeister. Follow me, please. Was starren Sie mich denn an? Haben Sie nichts anderes zu tun? Welcome, ladies, to the only British colony not inhabited by man. Come on. Miss King. Yes, Frau Holweg? These women are to be with you. Miss King is group leader of the women on floor two. Come with us. I'm Eleanor Hadfield. I live on your floor. You must be dying for tea. Have you got any? I exchanged a pair of corsets for a quarter. We can't rob you like that! Oh, but we shall be neighbours. I will leave you in your group leader's hands. Any complaints should be made to me. She's a beast. I've told her about calling me group leader! It's so German. I'm sector warden. We've one per floor, elected by the women. Freda Thompson, Rosemary Brown, this is your room. I'll be back for a chinwag. To think I had a crush on a girl like that at school. Has your room got two beds in it? Yes. So's mine. Something's odd about you. In what way? A girl imprisoned for six months passes a mirror without a glance. I daren't. Aha! Hot water? No water. Still, we can't expect everything. Pity! It's a nice bathroom. Like having a car with no petrol. Hello, the bill of charges is still here - The Grand, 200 francs a day. Shall we ring for our baggage? Needn't bother. Hello. I yelled to you out the window. Maud Wright, room 69. Freda Thompson, Rosemary Brown. Mind if I sit? Think you'll like it here? We might. That's what they all say at first. Here, have a fag end. Come on, Nellie, what're you doing? Afternoon. What's that in aid of? Getting you a bath. Mrs Burtshaw kept a tearoom. Nellie was a children's nurse. We have to leg it up from the kitchen - four flights. No joke. It's very good of you. Don't mention it. Lucy Wilson, straight from finishing school. Damn shame, stuck here! Good afternoon, I'm Mrs Cornelia Hope Latimer from room 76. Lady's maid to a countess. You'd think she's a countess. Trouble is we're not all out of the same drawer. I kept a girls' hostel. Before that I was at the Casino de Paris, one of the Six English Rosebuds - until the bloom wore off. The people one has to put up with! Things would be better for a little social distinction. What about her cousin, the general?! Annette married an Englishman in the wine trade who drank his stock. Misses the men, being French, but, oh, her clothes! Tearing me to pieces, Maud? No. This is Freda and Rosemary. Do you want some clothes? No, thanks, mine will be here soon. I can lend you some. You can't stick in this! Oh, let me fetch some. Oh, I wish you wouldn't! You don't seem to care a cuss what you look like or what happens to you Come on, before it gets cold. We bath tandem here. Two at once? It's cold for those who come last. The animals go in two by two? Twenty to one bath sometimes. I won't bother just now. Don't be shy. You've got to muck in. Hot water's like caviar. We pinch it from the Commandant's boiler. What's bothering you? Never undressed in front of others? No... I'd rather bath on my own. Wouldn't we all? You'll offend them if you back out now. Strip and become a popular figure. Somebody talking about me? Pleacher's gift to art! My next "innocence". She talks like she writes - cheap. I hear there's a bath. In the queue. Whoever's first. Oh, no, we're not competing with pros. Everything's organised. A bath! It's wonderful what can be done when we pull together. We've been told there's tea going. It's the team spirit... We've been told there's tea going. Bath? We had one before we left. If everyone applies themselves. We've done miracles in the time we've been here - ...we've started a gymnasium class, folk dancing, dressmaking. Spout it again, Towser! We have French, Spanish, Russian, German classes. We have a choir. Tea's up, but no sugar. No milk, either. Tea's all they ever think about. And men. I've almost forgotten them. They wear trousers, I remember that. Imagine a very large harem with the sultan away on holiday - that's us. From one week's end to... From one week's end to the next, not counting that rat... ...not a single man is allowed in. That'll give you an idea of our state of mind and the conversation! Not that it bothers me - I've seen enough of men to last me a lifetime. Who the devil was that? Monsieur Boper, hotel proprietor. Nasty little quisling. He has permission to wander to see we don't make a mess. Into the bath before it gets cold. 0thers are waiting. Okay. Here you are, take this. I bring thee towels and precious soap for the ablutions of the flesh. I begs next! I'll fetch your tea in. I'll be glad when there's none left. More time is wasted drinking it, making it and talking about it than on anything else. Wasting time is an occupation here. I consider that a demoralising attitude. They're bathing practically in public! I hope they won't ask us to do so. I should most certainly refuse. If we can't bath alone, what's left? Tea? Compare this with your last camp - 4, 000 in a barracks meant for 100... ...nowhere to exercise, nowhere to wash, packed together like sardines. Here, at least we have a little space and privacy. You did say "privacy"? Mmm. Come on, next customer, please. It's a different proposition here. There's no reason why we shouldn't become the happiest little community What's that?! I don't know, but I have a vague suspicion. That happens every day. The lady on top is the Honourable Mrs Primrose Ogilvy of Leicester. The one underneath ain't so 'igh class - Mrs Woodbury, widow of a wholesale butcher. They're up! Woodbury's attacking! Mrs Ogilvy's off her guard! They're down. What are they fighting about? Something in the dustbin. They're up again! Stop it at once! There you have it, life as the cannibals live it - Marneville. Have you finished? You can't have washed it properly! I've done all that was expected of me. She's right there, two spits and a dab - that's her day's work done. Here it comes. Keep it low, whatever you do. "The Russians are still resisting the German onslaught with tenacity and skill. It's true..." Golly, this is news! I thought something had happened when they stopped the Russian class. I had a Russian friend in Biarritz... Oh, shut your trap. Someone sends us a radio and all you do is cackle. "...to have made much progress." You will all come with me to the Kommandant's office at once! Some dirty skunk spilled the beans. What happened? We didn't give much away. We don't know who left it. I'd love to know who's Poison Ivy. Me, too. You realise that "Poison Ivy" must be one of a dozen people. How do you mean? Only 12 of us knew about it. You make it sound like a crime novel did the butler do it, did... Well, somebody did it. You send shivers down my spine. Maud... Come here. Can you and Freda come up to Mrs Latimer's room for a minute? What for? I don't want to talk here. Just you and Freda. 0kay. Freda! Yes? What is it? I want you upstairs for a minute. What's all the hoo-ha? Somebody stole the tea? Mrs Burtshaw and I thought you might be interested to know who informed on you about the radio set. You know who did it? We think so. Nellie will tell you. Must I? There's nothing to be afraid of. Out with it, lass! Well, I was scrubbing out the office and I saw the filing cabinet open. With our records in. I thought I'd look to see mine. I came across Rosemary Brown's record. Nellie speaks German. Where's all this leading to? It said she was arrested as a fifth columnist. Dressed as a nun. What? Give her a club foot and glasses! Those are the facts. Facts! I never heard anything so plain stinking in all my life! Come on, Maud. If one word of that yarn gets out, I'll wipe the floor with you! Well, of all the ingratitudes! I suppose there's nothing in it. You, too, Brutus? Just like you English pigs! You receive my hospitality! I'll pay for them after the war. You will pay me now! Taking my... Here. You're in this. Rosemary... Yes? We've heard something you ought to know about. They say you were arrested as a fifth columnist. Who told you this? The Skinner girl says she saw it in the records. It's true. I was arrested by French soldiers when we were evacuated. I was finding food for children. Were you dressed as a nun? I am a novice. Strewth! Couldn't you have told us? I was waiting for my clothes to come The Germans never sent them. Then I thought it'd embarrass you. I didn't want you behaving differently. I wouldn't behave differently if you were Joan of Arc. It's a pity it's turned out this way They're saying you're the informer. You don't believe that? Don't be a fool! What about Maud? Of course not. Tell her. Come here, both of you. What do you make of that? Why the devil didn't I guess? Bridie might just be making an appointment to meet him. Mata Hari worked at night. We shouldn't condemn her on evidence like that. We should give her the benefit of the doubt. I'd like to kick her in the teeth. Miss Meredith, your wool. Oh, thank you so much, dear. My trick, I think. Dummy. Then he put his arms around me and whispered, "I love you." What did you say? I asked when we'd get married. Practical, if dampening. He was married and offered alternatives - three months later went back to his wife. Six! I fought for my honour outside a bungalow at Harpenden. Lake Como to Harpenden! I've heard enough sordid stories. Nothing sordid about it - I won. What's the point? He was good-looking, I was innocent. I've never been in company where the conversation was so low. Surely there's some other subject. Anybody got the exact time? Three minutes to ten. I've got a headache. Can I have the kitchen keys to get aspirins from the cupboard? Put them back in my room. I'm going to bed soon. There's a key to the back door. Is there? The grounds are dark at ten when the torchlight crews change over. Verdammte Schweinerei! An die Geschutze! An die Posten! Was stehen Sie herum, Feldwebel? I wonder if they're our planes. Wouldn't crack at their own planes! Our boys going to Italy. I wish them luck. I'm going to bed. Me, too. We will join you. Good night. Good night. Just think, seven or eight RAF boys a few miles away up there. And here are we. Such a life! Good night, everybody. Good night. The poor boys. The guns must have hit them. It sounds as if they were going round and round, trying to find a place to settle. It's so dark they don't realise how close to the ground they are. It'd be very simple to let them know that, Clare. Very simple indeed. What are you going to do? Undo the blackout. We shall get into terrible trouble, Muriel. They're British aviators! I know...! It's the least we can do. Licht ausloschen! Sofort! Sehen Sie, dass das Licht verschwindet. Who is responsible for this? I am. And I. It was deliberate. This will be reported. What are your names? You'll find them on the door outside. Where did you put the spare? In my sponge bag in the left-hand drawer. Oh, yes. There. You know, Muriel, I feel we've struck a blow for England tonight. In our own small way. ♪ "Beside the Seaside" What wouldn't I do for a glass of foaming beer - pre-war stuff. I'll join you, Sergeant. An elementary sense of humour! How did you find me? How could I miss you? Whistling a taxi?! Was I whistling? Bloodhounds are out. After our blood. Come on! Hah, barbed wire. Where are we? How should I know?! The question is, are we inside or outside this lot? Even-money chance, ain't it? Funny, hearing the all-clear for your own air raid. The others all baled out. No chance of picking 'em up? No. I only got on to you because you were whistling. Where'd that light come from? Here, look at this. Looks like a spa of some kind. Blimey! Join the RAF and fly on your stomach! Down! What does that look like to you? Hotel, chateau, workhouse...? A brewery?! That's not funny! We'd best hide there while those searchlights are on the job. Where does the next lap take us to? Takes me up that fire escape and leaves you here. I'm not subject to discipline now - I'm a hunted animal. Then go to earth for a bit, till I get back. Come on, lend a hand here. If it is a brewery, I'll tap out "B" for Bass on the ironwork. Er... Pardonnez-moi, mademoiselle... Er... Je suis un homme Du RAF. Voulez-vous donner moi I'abri, s'il vous plait? You're all right, aren't you? Eh? Not wounded or anything? No, this is just one of those moments I... Let me get my bearings. I baled out, you know. It's a bit shattering, this... all at once. I mean... a girl like you sitting up in bed... ...calmly, talking English perfect English ...acting as if RAF men dropped in from the skies every night. How did you expect me to act? I don't know. Do you mind if I sit? You might have screamed. Why? Well, it isn't what a girl expects when she switches on the light. The searchlights are scouring for us. Us? There's a sergeant down below. I know it's a deuce of a thing to ask, but I suppose we couldn't... Of course you can. We can? We'll be gone at the crack of dawn, and... I'm not very good at thanking people. Please don't try. What will your husband have to say to this? I haven't a husband. I haven't a husband. Hm? That's my friend's bed. I see. Lucky you speak English. My French is terrible. So is mine. What? I'm English, too. This is France? Yes. Occupied France? Yes. You're English? Yes. Aren't you interned? I am. Good evening. You did get our signal, then. I'm so glad. Eh? We knew you were in trouble and opened the blackout. Miss Manningford and Miss Meredith. How did you manage to come straight here? Where are the others? It's only me and Pilot 0fficer Moore How foolish of the others not to follow. Where am I? Marneville Internment Camp for British women. Come on now, nark it! I do not tell lies, young man! I suppose it is surprising. This is a women's internment camp. No men? Of course not. Well... good night, ladies. Where are you going? I can't stay - I'm married! It's an enclosed camp - none of us can get away. They're strict about that. That's not likely... What did you do with your parachute? I buried it. Suppose that dog sniffs it out? I know that nice doggie quite well he wouldn't sniff anything out. Your friend will have to take care of himself. But you'll be safe here. You're not suggesting we have a man here all night! My dear Clare, it's our duty. The young man shall sleep in your bed. You shall share mine. What will my wife say?! She'll say I baled out on purpose! We certainly shan't tell. Let's see. If we turn out the lights we can undress in the dark everything will be proper. I do hope we're doing the right thing. Young man, if you have matches, kindly place them on the mantel shelf. We often talk about where we'd most like to land if we had to bale out. I always imagined a room rather like this... with a girl rather like you. Good night, Maud. Good night. Shut the door! It's real! Maud Wright and Freda Thompson. Pilot Officer James Moore - he's baled out. I thought he dropped in for darts! Miss Brown explained a few things. Explain a few to us. He baled out. I climbed up the fire escape. Just happened to pick this room? By luck. There's a wireless operator, too. Where? Outside. Shouldn't we fetch him? Yes... perhaps it might. I don't know how to thank you girls. We'll have the address later! Watch out for the searchlights. Where can they spend the night? Or where can't they? I'm glad you're all here. What do you want? Margaret's in a state - a man peeped through her curtains. We were having a private talk. You know how some of the guards are. I told her to report it to Frau Holweg. What?! Where is she? Downstairs. You've got to do something for us. Head Margaret off. Hold them up as long as you can! I don't see why... You will. Buzz along, old girl. I can't see that fool sergeant anywhere. Maybe your sergeant peeped into Margaret's room. Margaret? A local amenity. Did you see her? No. Must have been him. Sort of thing he would do! We must stop this spreading. This place could give the African drum system a ten-minute start! The stairs, Maud - if you see Holweg, whistle. We'll take a room apiece. If their hair's down and their teeth are in - there's a man in the room! Good Lord! ...What the butler saw! Rosemary! First time a coconut. He's here. Put that light out! I won't keep you. Your pal's with us Oh, is he? This thing must be kept quiet. We'll sort it out in the morning. Holweg's on the prowl, so lie doggo! Oh, dear, what a calamity. After 53 years - this! She's coming up. We found him. I'll tell you in the morning. Fasten the room, dear. Dead to the world. Not surprised! He's good-looking, or isn't he? Maybe it's from being cooped up for a year. He has got a nice forehead. Hmm... Well, maybe we better leave him there and get to bed. Would undoing his collar help him breathe easier? Shouldn't think so, but you can try if you like. Has he got hair on his chest? Oh, for goodness' sake, Freda! Where are you sleeping? I'll share your bed, it'll look better. Stop mucking about and get into bed. Let's go straight to sleep and get up early to work this out. All right. We shall only jaw if we don't. I suppose so. You don't think that bed's too short for him? He must be at least six feet. Good night, Rosemary. Good night, Freda. Good night, girls. Five feet eleven and three quarters. Coming to the gym class, Freda? I'm going to Rosemary's Latin class. Has she started a Latin class? First lesson this morning. Physical jerks would do you more good than a dead language. Hurry, Maud, time for gym class. I'm going to Rosemary's Latin class. You? Latin? Yeah, me, Latin! All clear. Quick! Tell me again about the camp boundaries. There must be a weak spot. The orchard walls are high. There's barbed wire on top - electrified. Then there's the outer perimeter. I have a plan of escape that I was keeping to myself. I'll divulge it if it's of any use. What is it? You know the Commandant's offices? Well, my plan was to sneak up at night... ...plunge a knife in the sentry's back, make my way to the front door, slit the guard's throat... ...creep to the private gate - there's a guard there... And cut out his entrails?! It involves spilling a little blood. Anybody else got suggestions? I hesitate to mention it, but you came down in that apparatus... ...couldn't you inflate it again and, er... Our best chance is on Saturday we've got a concert then and the guard is always relaxed. Has anybody got a map of the place? I have. I'll bet! It's home-made. Go and fetch it, Ruddy Mary! I don't think that was called for! She doesn't mean it. I'll keep an eye on the door. Who the hell's this? Monsieur Boper - the proprietor. He's with the Germans. Shall I take care of him? Good morning. I did not expect you here, although I presumed one of you was in the camp. Why? A flying glove was found outside the wall of the inner perimeter... ...marked with the initials DLK. He's trying to bluff his way out! DLK are the initials of one of our chaps. Why tell us this? If nobody else will start on him, I will! The Germans are organising parties to search the entire camp. I think you would do better to listen to me instead. If you're trying to intimidate us, I remind you that we are British! And I, madame, am French. If I could be certain that not a word of this goes beyond this room... ...it is possible that something might be done. You're not proposing to help us? It's a trick! It's not a question of whether you can trust me, but if I can trust you I must be certain of that. What have we got to lose? Clare! She's right - what have we to lose? If you help us, you can rely on us not to say a word. Very well, I will trust you. If they can get to the thermal baths... ...it is a risk, of course... ...there is an attic there where I do not think they will be found. I will draw a plan for you. I work for my country, but this is the biggest sacrifice I have made. It is the place where I have stored my wines. Wines? Yes, but you must promise on your oath not to touch a single bottle of it. Only on that condition do I tell you. We promise. Take them by the kitchen staircase. By the covered way - the hall of the baths. You follow the rest? I think so. Here is the key. You must hurry now. Thank you. Il n'y a pas de quoi, Monsieur. Just a minute! If this thing works out, we shan't forget you. But if you're double-crossing us... Mademoiselle, several women have escaped from here. Someone must have helped. Someone also left you a radio. Think it over. Well, I'll be damned! Which way is the emergency exit? Follow me. Teresa has the kitchen keys. We can't go any other way. Towser didn't take her handbag to gym class. Her keys must be in her room. I'll watch the hall. I'll come with you. My heart's going jump, jump, jump! Got it? It's probably in this locked drawer. She can't have taken the key. Try this. That's it. Here we are. What's this? What does it matter? Can you read German? Look. What is it? It's a Nazi Party card. It says Teresa Resinger is a member of the Nazi Party. " Attention! Internees in blocks A, B, C, D and E... ...will proceed at once to the main lounge." "I will repeat that." Too late. The place is surrounded. Quiet, please! Will everybody seat themselves as quickly as possible, please. "Blocks A, B, C, D and E will remain vacant until further word is received from this office." "That is all." What are you doing here? We have orders to search the place. Why are you not in the lounge? I sprained my ankle last night on the kitchen stairs. Who are you looking for? The crew of a British bomber baled out over here last night. You don't think I'd conceal a British airman here? I am not accusing you. I was called out on duty last night I had no chance to explain. Yes, yes, but surely it isn't necessary to search here... Entschuldigung, Herr Feldwebel. Ich wusste nicht, dass Sie hier sind Well, I hope you find him, Sergeant. Good morning. Machen Sie, dass Sie weiterkommen! Zu Befehl. Lock that door. Who was that? Just a German soldier. You have a way with German sergeants. What did he mean, he was called out on duty last night? He was bringing me tea. You don't imagine I'd have anything to do with a German, do you? Then why accept tea from him? I like tea, and he happens to be in charge of the stores. You have been assembled here... ...because it is believed that some British airmen... ...may have concealed themselves in this camp. You will remain here until the search is over. Do you understand? Nobody is to leave until the order is given! These precautions are for your own protection. What is it? Airmen. There's two of the airmen there. They've rumbled. What are we going to do? Two of the airmen are at the back. We must stop this reaching Teresa. Tell them she's a Nazi agent. Stop the story - Teresa's an agent Who is? Teresa. Teresa's a Nazi. Stop that story - Teresa's a Nazi. Teresa's a Nazi spy! Stop the story! Teresa is a German agent - mustn't let her know about the airmen. What's happened? Someone's fainted. "Attention, please! All internees from blocks A, B, C, D and E may now leave the lounges." Inside, quickly, we'll hang about outside and keep the mob at bay. I could be happy here. You'll be safe here. For how long? Women can't keep their mouths shut. You may be surprised. I'll be back tonight with food. Will you be coming from the back? Along the covered walk - to dodge the searchlights. Will you be passing that little summerhouse? Why? Er, confidentially, I shall be waiting for you. You're staying here! Quarter to ten? You'll be caught in the lights! I'll dodge them. I'll be back with the food. Quarter to, in the summerhouse. Make it ham sandwiches! That girl's face gets on my nerves. I've seen her before somewhere. Everything about her - her eyes, her face, her neck, her shape... Must you? I'm concentrating on the parts I'm likely to remember. Well, don't! What if somebody talks? We must warn everybody to shut up! The boys don't think we can do it. We can have a damn good try. Passion Fruit, wanting to know where the men are? There's another. Another what? I've got one, too. For the love of Mike! Where? In my room. Why didn't you tell us? How'd he manage to land with you? Radio location! We can't leave him opposite Teresa. We should get him to the others. When Rosemary takes the food. I'll meet him at the fire escape. All right. Why has Rosemary got all the luck? Three live men in the camp and all I get is a reflection in a mirror! Just fancy, if I was home I'd be on the sofa with my feet up. Your wife allows that? With my feet down, smoking, working through the News of the World. If it isn't Sunday? The middle page lasts me the week. "0ld Man, 90, Elopes With Girl 17." "Solicitor Strangles Showgirl." "Solicitor Strangles... ...Showgirl" Mary Maugham, singer and dancer, London Hippodrome, 1938! What are you drivelling about?! Your girlfriend - Mary Maugham! Don't be an idiot! I'm not kidding! She got mixed up with a married man who tried to poison his wife. The missus and I had words she said the girl knew he was married, I said she didn't. I went for a glass of bitter and missed me Sunday dinner! Chamberlain flew to Munich to knock it off the front page. It can't be her. The fella did seven years, she went into a convent. That sinks it. She isn't a nun. No, no, you're wrong, Alec. Photographs in the papers always look the same. I saw her on the stage! I remember her song. How did it go? ♪ You're delightful, you're delicious, you're divine ♪ You're exotic, you're exciting, you're like wine ♪ La-di, da-da, la-didah, di-Dada d-a-a-a! It sounds awful. Eh? ...Oh. It's time I pushed off. You ask her. Yes? And if it isn't true, I get a sock on the jaw. If it is true you get a sock on the jaw! You're mad. Am I? There's another of your men here. "DLK". Dave! Where on earth's he been? One of the girls hid him. I'll bring him later. Well, I'll be damned! Old Dave! Well, things certainly happen around here! Not always pleasantly. They brought me closer to you. You're lovely. Don't talk like that. You're delightful. You're exotic, you're exciting, you're divine. Know the rest? So it's true, then? What's true? That song - Alec told me. I don't know what you mean. The convent part fooled me. How long were you there? I haven't told you anything! Have you taken the vows? No. Anything else? You still love him? No. Will you go back to the convent? No. Yes. 0ne day you'll meet somebody and regret it. I shouldn't meet anyone else. I could almost climb the convent wall The searchlights will be off in a second. It's time we moved. You know best. Somebody in the grounds. A guard? I couldn't tell. I see. In England you'll tell your friends about this. You'll make me a nun. Do you prefer London or the country? It'll go down well in the mess. I prefer the country. A success at parties! I know just the spot in Dorset. You can tell your wife. What would be the point? She knows it already. Don't you take anything seriously? Sergeant Hentzner. Who's he? One of the guards. Good Lord! He's friendly with the girl hiding David. Like that, is it? Which room? First room past mine. Quick! Let me in. Schwein! Dave? Dave, where are you? Where the hell's that switch? Is he all right? He's dead. He's dead. Shut up! There's no need to go into a spin. It's our job, we're paid for it, however inadequately. I'd have chosen a better spot, Dave! He nearly got me! He can't be found here. He won't. Answer yes, as if you'd been asleep Yes, I'm all right. What do you want? We heard a row going on. Perhaps it was on the next floor. No, it sounded nearer than that. What will you do? He'll be safe with us. Switch the lights out. Look slippy, Dave. Dave, I know what you're thinking... I guess I've been dumb. I'd only spoken to him. I swear! Oh, yeah. Can't stand here arguing. I must see you again... You can't go like this! Shut up! I don't care who he is, I don't! Better try and quieten her down. Dave! Two extra lodgers. 0ne alive and one dead. What have you been up to? Dave was hiding in the camp. Got in an argument with Marmaduke here. Why have that swine here?! Can't leave him lying about in the grounds. Can't you bury him? Under the searchlights? The boy's looking pale. How long do we keep him? We make a break for it on Saturday. He won't last that long. My aunt died in Aberdeen. She wanted to be buried in West Bromwich but missed the train connection. I'm not staying here till then! Sit down. You'll stay and like it! We're not messing up our escape because of a dead Jerry. Life's tough, ain't it, mate? Hm, a regular dummy hand this time! Reminds me of a dream I had. I was playing bridge with Crippen, Henry VIII and Lady Godiva. Every time I said "pass", Henry VIII bit Lady Godiva in the ear! Count me out! Shall I take your hand, too? "I'd be obliged if you would." Ooh, better count him out the next round. He's cheating. Don't let this get under your skin, Dave. He's only a stiff. Oh, drunk as well, eh? Where did you get this? It's an old dress. I'm making something for the concert I have a message for the others. Listen, and do not interrupt. That's a one-minute blackout to get the boys away. What worries me is cutting the outside loudspeakers to make it sound as if the concert's over. We need an act to keep the Commandant in his seat for the next 20 minutes. What about Lucy? She only knows two songs. I've just seen Monsieur Boper. The Germans are in a stew! Sergeant Hentzner has disappeared, the Gestapo's been called in. Should we put the escape off? We can't. Will the Commandant turn up? Monsieur Boper says yes. He says if the boys do get away he'll meet them at the crossroads. It's up to us. All we need is an act. It's got to be sensational. The officers must stay to the end. I don't know if this is proper, but we could persuade Bridie... ...to divest herself of her clothes, as she did on the Paris stage. Mrs Hadfield! Well, I don't know! Striptease! No man leaves before the last veil drops. I refuse to be a party to it! It is for patriotic reasons. You're in the minority, dear. Where is Bridie? I haven't seen her. Probably in her room. I'll handle her. The whole thing's revolting! Bridie. What do you want? The escape - we need an act that'll keep the Nazis glued in their seats. Your take-off will do nicely. I won't do it. Don't be silly. I don't care if he doesn't escape. You need a kick in the pants! What can that fellow mean to you? How can you know? I've a rough idea - hectic night, six aspirins and here's to the next! I'll go mad if I don't see him again I've heard that before. Here, if you promise to trot out the old torso tonight... ...I'll take you to your boyfriend. What do you say? I don't know. You will. I'll come back for you tonight. A disgrace! Taking advantage of us! They always pick on the innocent ones. What happened? They're taking Miss Manningford and Miss Meredith away. They're taking Miss Manningford. Where? To a camp in Germany.

Goodbye. ♪ For they are jolly good fellows ♪ For they are jolly good fellows For they are jolly good fellows ♪ And so say all of us ♪ Is the Commandant here? No, he always makes a late entrance. Everything okay, Maud? Yeah, okay. Only open the door to three knocks. Must you go now? Yes. Why? You can't stop me. It's hell talking to you in front of other fellas. When this is over, come back with me. No. A cottage in Dorset? Must I answer? Yes. No. I thought about it last night - you'll escape and I'll be left rotting here. War may go on for years. Does it matter how long? Yes. Anything can happen. And we've only known each other a few days. You're mad now. Maybe. I didn't want you to ask me all these questions. You insisted.

As if we haven't enough troubles! Is the escape off? No. I'll go and talk to the boys. You wait here. Hey, Dave. Yeah? Come here just a second. What is it? I know what you think of Bridie. But I want you to see her again. She was with that German - she isn't fit to breathe the same air as you. Is that so? You'll listen and you'll believe me! If 17 judges pronounced you innocent, I wouldn't believe them. Take it easy. I wouldn't be seen dead in hell with you. You're rotten to the bottom of your dirty little soul. That's the right goodbye. But the wrong moment! She is filling the last act in the bill. She's holding those Nazis while you get away! This was bound to happen with women! I'll fetch her back. No, write her a note. Tell her you've just heard what a sacrifice she's making. She'll believe it? A woman in love believes anything. Tell her hate is akin to love - ...as you've told her you hate her, it means you very nearly love her! Here. Come on, Dave, I'll help you out. 0kay. We're on in five minutes, Teresa, hurry up. I've never written such a pack of lies! Blame it on me. If it does the trick, that's all that matters. Lock the door. Snap out of it, sweetheart, here's your fairy godmother. I told him you were doing your act. He asked me to give you this. I hate him. The same way that he hates you. I thought you understood men. You're due on in ten minutes, better get changed. Want any help? No! No, I'll be all right. I'll be down. Leave me alone. Okay. What do you want? I wrote that note. What do you mean? It's no use, I know what you are. What are you doing? You're not leaving here. Have you gone mad? You're not leaving until the boys get away. Have you a light, please? Ja. Thank you so much. It's a lovely night, don't you think? Annette's working on the chauffeur. We can't go on without Teresa. What's gone wrong? Towser hasn't turned up. We'll be terrible without her. You'll be terrible anyway! I've got the boys' food.
