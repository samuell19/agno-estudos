In war, a week is a whole life condensed. There's no tricks, no masks. There's excitement, ecstasy. There's fear, moral commitment, empathy. But without denying the essence of life: Everything's random and fleeting. And that's very attractive. If there's one thing that surprises me about war is that it's decided by adults but fought by kids. BOOM! When I'm in Afghanistan, I'm always surprised by the youth of the soldiers. You can tell they don't know the price. They don't realize the price they'll pay. I decided to start Dying To Tell with them, with the image of these young soldiers, because I didn't realize either the high price I'd pay for this work. Call it work, vocation, it's a way of life, a profession. "We go to war in search of adventures, but we come back with a suitcase full of bodies." Pérez-Reverte wrote it and I think it stands true. I didn't know the price I'd pay in my daily life, in my everyday life. I didn't know how much of me would die. How much dies in all of us to be able to tell the story. DYING TO TELL The border with Turkey was closed, so we resorted to smugglers. Arms, people smugglers. We had a fixer, the person supposedly in charge of our security. But we didn't receive that protection. From start to finish we moved around in a van with the fixer's friends. That didn't bode too well. We lasted two days, it could have been less. The last images of Ángel Sastre, Antonio Pampliega and José Manuel López. They entered Syria on the 10th from Turkey, and were last seen in Aleppo. Their latest reports... Sastre is the one I know less. But I've worked a lot with Antonio. And López and I... We studied photography together. DISAPPEARED IN SYRIA I'm worried and pissed. We'll get in line to chastise them when they get them out. They went in when things were already very complicated. The kidnapping of Antonio and López was tougher for me than those of any other colleagues, because I remember them taking me out of Aleppo when I was hurt. So you feel helpless, not being able to pay back the help they gave me. And not being able to do something so they could get out. When I found out they'd kidnapped Antonio, López, and Sastre, I got mad at them. Because we'd already talked, I'd talked with Antonio a few weeks earlier, he said he was going to Syria and I said he was crazy. "Don't go, it's suicidal." You know what happened to James Foley, what happened to other colleagues. These people are on the hunt, they're targeting us. My intention was being embedded with the White Helmets, and follow these teams of rescuers in the hell that is Aleppo. These people go from bomb site to bomb site to look for bodies and survivors among the rubble. While we were there they decapitated Chinese and Norwegian journalists. IS WINS NEW ENEMIES A pregnant German woman who said goodbye to her husband at the border and must have had the child there. There's 26 journalists still inside. I thought I'd be killed or sold, it's what they were telling me. I was kidnapped ten months. Diarrheas are common, anything related to a lack of hygiene. Spots, rashes, blemishes. There were advanced security cameras. Infrared cameras and all. You have 160 square feet, you do what you can. You write. Exercise was forbidden. You move in a cross, in a circle. I blocked any thoughts of my family so I wouldn't lose heart. My parents supported me, they knew I would always get out, I was a professional. And I failed them. That... That makes me feel very guilty. No piece of news is worth the pain I caused my family. I see my work as solving an equation. On one side is the risk I'm taking, and on the other my results. If I maximize my results, minimizing risks, it's a job better done. Taking risks is not my job. In the field you have seconds, not hours, to decide which way to go and how. And sometimes the desire, the impulse to get there as quick as possible makes you take big risks, but sometimes it's just luck. If this is your profession, you have to know really well what you want and where you're going. You know the risks you're taking, and when you go somewhere you know these things. At least I do. Even taking the most responsible decisions, you might die. It's a war zone. And bombs don't ask who's responsible, if you're a child or an adult. We were at a hotel called Spinghar. It's the name of a mountain range near Jalalabad, a city in the east of Afghanistan. And there was the opportunity, from Jalalabad, for a certain group of journalists to go to Kabul. Julio Fuentes and I said we weren't going to go to Kabul because what we were finding for our chronicles in Jalalabad was fantastic. But, and Julio never explained this to me, the same night plans were made for that convoy that was going from Jalalabad to Kabul he changed his mind and the next day he said, "Pepe", that's what he often called me, "I'm going to Kabul." We said goodbye. I clearly remember what he was wearing. Then they told us the convoy had been shot down. The survivors arrive, and Julio Fuentes was nowhere to be seen. Have you seen the guys from El Mundo? No, only seen you and your partner. I think they've gone through, but we haven't seen them. - All you guys from TV3 are okay? - Yeah, yeah. We came back when we saw the drivers come without the journalists. They were shouting in Pashto to get out of there immediately because they had seen with their own eyes how the journalists they had been driving were shot. Julio was my husband. So the paper called me that morning saying something had happened. And to go to the paper. We couldn't reach Julio. And we knew something had happened on that road. We were in Kabul in one of the few available rooms at a hotel. We got a mattress and put it in our room, expecting Julio. But the hours went by and Julio didn't come. Rumors started to surface about the killing of journalists, and slowly anxiety took over. A LEGEND All the journalists there said, "We have to agree not to say, not to mention the word 'death' until we can confirm it's Julio Fuentes who has died." Very early the next morning, a convoy of Mujahideen went out and then came back. When they came back there were sirens, the Afghan chaos, crowds, and as soon as I saw Julio, the coffin that said "Fuentes, Spain", I called Mónica to tell her. And then, obviously, all the grief, sorrow, and drama settled in. Sadly, we have to confirm the death of the special correspondent of El Mundo to the war in Afghanistan, Julio Fuentes. Julio's car was the first in line, and they were ambushed. Ambushed by Afghans who tried to rob them. I imagine they resisted, there was a shooting, and they all died, We were all in a state of shock. During conflicts you never think it'll be someone you know. He'd been everywhere. How could he fall in Afghanistan? I'd been with him in many other places. In other conflicts. And, suddenly, you feel orphaned. You're the survivor. "Why him and not me?" Sensibly, whoever picked up the bodies took them to the Pakistani border, and that's where we brought him home from. I had a personal relationship with Mónica. She was like a daughter to me. I went with her to the border, which was... It was sinister. His bloodied clothes were on the ground. They'd cut off one of his fingers to tear off his ring. Mónica was remarkable, she was so young. She was given a parcel and a jacket, which was obviously Julio's. Before going on that trip, the last coffee he had at the paper was with me, and he was very nervous. He didn't want to go, he was sick. Julio was tired. Everybody has their limit. Some people are lucky enough to quit at the right moment, and others aren't. Julio Fuentes used to say that the current job would be his last, but always unconvincingly. Throughout our journey, we've always felt the temptation of saying, "I'm done, that's it, I'm retiring." But immediately afterwards, when a new opportunity arises to cover something, we all feel butterflies in the stomach, wanting to go as soon as possible. Julio was like that. And I doubt that when he said, "This is my last reporting job", he really meant it. I've always liked covering international conflicts. And I've always tried to lick my wounds as best as possible. My emotional wounds, the infamous PTSD. But I won't give it up. Because this is our life, our career. And giving up now... I still haven't lived through something that makes me decide that. We had a house in Cantabria we'd built the year before. Where Julio wanted to retire one day to write books. It was very important to us. A house which I remembered because he would draw it for me on napkins in Bosnia. He was obsessed with drawing his house at Potes. I was sick and tired of it. What I didn't know is that, a few years later, we'd scatter his ashes there. He was partially deaf. He was injured during a war, he became deaf from an exploding shell. Some conversations were surreal because he didn't hear you. He'd respond to something else, and you'd say, "Julio, what are you talking about?" Julio was funny, his deafness made him seem mean, he was always going "What?" But no, he was really nice and endearing. He was a good guy, a fighter. He fought to get the news with true bravery. A year after his death I had the chance to go to Afghanistan. I spoke with the judge in charge of his case in Kabul. He said, "I promise we'll find him, them, and we'll kill them in your name." I said, "It's not about killing them. It's about them not killing others." ARRESTED BAND LEADER Death penalty doesn't solve a thing. There comes a time when your work is your most important weapon. If you're seeing so many people die or get hurt, it's not strange for it to happen to you or a friend. It would be strange if it didn't. I lost one person. I know families that have lost 14 members. Before a trip there's always a lot of noise. Lots of planning, visas, equipment, so many things. But once at the airport, once in the plane, you always feel you're in a parallel reality to other people's. Wars usually start in summer and everybody is going on holiday while you go with a camera, a bulletproof vest, and everything is really strange. Making decisions during a war isn't the same as making them at home. When you decide to cross a border, enter a country or follow a story, making decisions is always like tossing a coin and waiting to see where it lands. I remember Somalia, constantly making decisions. "Should we go to Bakaara market or not? Should we go to the front or not?" That's a constant stress. Anything can happen at any moment. There's a free for all of misfortunes. MOGADISHU AIRPORT The beginning of every trip, every decision, takes me back to my family. Above all my mother, because of the pain I can inflict on her. On someone who loves me unconditionally, like her. Losing a child is the most traumatic experience. And this is something selfish, this vocation. Well, we were in the Ancient Town of Aleppo with a group of the Syrian Free Army which was trying to attack a sniper post of Al-Assad's army. And once we supposed we were close to the sniper post, they were going to throw hand grenades. One of the fighters took a grenade and instead of throwing it, he kept it. I don't know exactly what happened. And he was blown to pieces. When I got up and saw I'd been hit by the shrapnel, all I could think about were my kids and the fact that I'd be fucking them up if I didn't get out of there. When it happened I thought... I can't quite understand how Roberto is still alive. Luckily. The shrapnel didn't... It didn't severe any arteries. He was so lucky. Because we had problems to get a ambulance there. Of course, the Spanish embassy... Sometimes they don't want to intervene. If it weren't for the comradeship of some people... ...he wouldn't be alive to tell it. CAMERAMAN ROBERTO FRAILE INJURED IN SYRIA I was bedridden for a month, a month and a half, and I knew the first thing I had to do was return to Syria, experience a similar experience, and see if I could stand it or not. At home, my family didn't say a word, not even my mother, They all knew I'd go back. If someone deserves a prize, one of those war correspondent prizes, it's not us but our families. They've had to suffer it 24/7. They think we're permanently endangered, not only when we're stopped at gun point at a check point, and those ten seconds are the only critical moment of the day. From home they experience it... It's a bad experience. Knowing your son is, I don't know, in Aleppo, where 20 barrel bombs and scuds fall every day and there are shots being fired, and you see 300 deaths in the news. You know your son isn't the 301st because the picture is his. But until you see that... I've been lucky in my life in the sense that those who've loved me have done so in the most beautiful and radical way possible, wanting me to be free. They wanted me to be free. Even though that has meant, for my parents, for my brother, for my friends, of course for my wife, the possibility of receiving a call saying, "David won't be coming back." You have to understand that's a possibility. It's not just a figure of speech. Obviously my family has suffered a lot. Regarding my partners, there's been all sorts. Although I've broken up relationships because when they said, "Why don't we retire and do gardening?", I'd think, "Between retiring and doing gardening or having the whole world at my doorstep..." I can't live with someone who doesn't understand my work. Leaving your family at home is one of the hardest things to do. For many years I've missed my kids' childhood, daily contact with them, everyday life. Sometimes you only see them every few months. And at that age they change. They change almost hourly. I hope my kids have an example of a certain way of life. I want to teach them that everybody is important, whether they're Spanish or Syrian. And that... you shouldn't stop going to Syria because it's dangerous. Because you're Spanish. And you have a family and your bubble is the most important thing. I want them to know their father thinks there's a series of values, giving voice to Syrians, for example, and that he's willing to go there even if it's harder. Javier Espinosa, correspondent for El Mundo, and the freelance photographer Ricardo García Vilanova were kidnapped September 16th in the north of Syria trying to leave the country at the Turkish border. I was preparing a trip into Syria with a visa from Damascus, when I found out he'd been kidnapped. That was a shock. Going through that process and seeing your colleague had been kidnapped, JAVIER ESPINOSA KIDNAPPED BY AL QAEDA RELATED GROUPS When Javier disappeared and we lost touch with him for days, we began to worry more every day. I was in constant contact with Mónica because she took charge of the situation immediately. I'm Mónica Prieto, and I'm Javier Espinosa's partner. We've taken in fleeing civilians, we've defended your liberty as our own. Javier and Ricardo aren't your enemies. Please honor the revolution they protected, and set them free. Thank you. The family spokesman and the paper's director say the kidnappers haven't asked for anything, and that both men were doing fine a month ago. I still remember the day Tony, Javier's father, called me to ask me to be their spokesman. I realized it would be tough on me too, it was a hard choice, but I couldn't say no. What the kidnappers of over 30 journalists, 18 of them foreigners, have achieved, is that covering the news from Syria becomes increasingly impossible. I set up a strategy that turned out really well. It wasn't an obvious choice. I asked Mónica not to tell me what I couldn't say. Things happened that were a bit odd or even painful. Colleagues who demanded, "You have to tell me." "I'm also a friend of Monica and Javier." "You think only you know things?" My reaction was, "Please, you can take this whole experience, I wish it were you instead of me. So you could really know how a situation like this wears you down." THEY HAVEN'T ASKED FOR ANYTHING KIDNAPPING NOBLE AND BRAVE JOURNALISM SOMEONE HAS TO TELL IT When Christmas came, things were awful. And, also, I needed... I couldn't sit down to Christmas dinner without speaking to Mónica, to Javier's parents, and to Ricardo's parents. 100 DAYS KIDNAPPED BY AL QAEDA One of my last memories as a director was the sad Christmas Eve we were missing Javier. We had the feeling maybe he'd call that day. It didn't happen then, it was later. But when he was freed, it was a wonderful day. I went with Mónica to pick up his kids, we all went to the airport and the hug between Mónica, Javier, and the kids was one of those moments of complete happiness. She had started a new life with Javier, and it was a bit like the triumph of life over misfortune. I'm so happy to see all four of you here! JOURNALISM COMES HOME Obviously, when you become a parent your views change completely. In a positive way. I always tell the same anecdote. When I came back from being kidnapped, all they did... Because Mónica did a great job there with the kids, all they said was, "Let's play guards and prisoners." So we started playing prison, as if it were the most fun thing in the world! It was great because it meant coming back to reality. To the tangible, and not your made-up stories. So, if we have to find a way for journalists not to have traumas, let them have kids and face playing ball, making breakfast, and forget about their obsessive stories. Mónica, as well as being a great journalist, is a very brave woman. After the murder of Julio Fuentes, that personal tragedy for her, she ended up marrying another journalist, Javier, and is still a strong woman, and that's extremely brave. I have great fondness for Mónica. She's a brave woman. During Javier's kidnapping she said, "I can't be devastated, I've got two kids. That's the important thing. With their father gone, I have to be their mother and father, I can't crack." That's pure strength. The most frightening thing about a war... Or what I was taught about wars is that you should fear large crowds. You should avoid crowds. They always say that. Against one man you can reason, against two you can fight. Against a thousand you can't do anything. You could get lynched, I've seen it. I've lived in large cities, in Kolkata, in Buenos Aires. And now I need to live in nature. It's hard for me to face crowds, I feel anxious. They awaken that state of alert which I now associate with trauma and pain. Joseph Kony was a madman who kidnapped boys to turn them into soldiers and girls into sexual slaves just because. There was no basis for it, not religious, not political. For me, Kony is the perfect example of the absurdity of war. When I arrived in Sudan in 2009, after five years of following Kony around Africa, I see that the Sudanese soldiers who should be doing something to defend civilians against Kony, spent their time smoking joints. It was a party, a nonsensical party. So the local youth, enthusiastically but recklessly, got hold of weapons. They were called the Arrow Boys. They used bows and arrows. They grabbed their grandparent's weapons and went out to hunt Joseph Kony and his men. War is very nocturnal. The darkness, the fear. Especially in Africa, where there's no light. I associate the night with fear, with Africa. With Kony. I feel very helpless now when I go out at night. I guess that's why. And because at night we're really alone. It's the moment I feel most like a child. When all the ghosts come to visit. Fear is necessary. Without it, we'd die the first day at a conflict zone. It's a fear you must learn to control and to ration. You have to learn to live with it. So you can go about your daily work in a war. I feel the fear at night. When you go to bed, when you're resting. It's like a jackhammer hitting your head, which starts to hurt, and you don't know why, but it's fear. The Palestine called me Eric "Majnun", "Crazy Eric". Because I wasn't afraid. And that isn't good either. Because fear is what helps you know if you have to take the next step. Being afraid is human and makes you cautious. And since I was never afraid, that posed a problem. The best security weapon in Afghanistan was going unnoticed. Being like any Afghan. And I've always had fear in the back of my mind. The fear of a possible... A possible raping. I've lived in Egypt, and there I suffered daily sexual aggressions. The daily occurrence doesn't make it less important nor do you get used to it. Anyway, it's something you can't control. Never. When it happens, it happens, and, well... You do your best, obviously, but... I always say I'm a scaredy-cat. I'm not brave. I've never been brave. But I think fear is necessary. Even more, I try to know... When I work with someone, I make sure they're afraid. Fear is a defense mechanism that tells you, "You shouldn't be here". And if it doesn't work, there's something deeply wrong. Nobody should reach that point. In the year 1993-94, Miguel told me he was the eldest brother and did I need him? I said I didn't. So he took his bike and his typewriter and left. That was his start in life's journey. At that time I was covering the Balkan war for Spanish television. And there came up this character, there's no other way to put it, who had arrived by bike from Barcelona. He told us his story. He was a lawyer who was very interested in seeing the events in the former Yugoslavia, so he went over there. He didn't really know what to do, so I told him, "Listen, one way of seeing the conflict is as a journalist. You can stay here reporting and explaining things." This is so my mom can see Sarajevo isn't dangerous. That's the Holiday Inn. That's a UN tank. My friend Chenga. And Sabina. When his holidays were over he got on his bike and went back to Barcelona. And 15 days later or so, a month tops, he was back. And he started to learn. He was a journalist starting off in the war with credentials from a motorcycle magazine. He was the first one to cross mount Igman on his bike, and all of us at the press center cheered. He worked as an APTN producer, in charge of transporting equipment to the more complex zones, into Sarajevo through mount Igman. Not only did he get in, he also got out the same way, and back in. People couldn't believe it. Italian bastard! - Sorry? - Italian bastard. One day, the cameraman for AP was sick and they asked, "Can you operate a camera?" He said, "No problem." He ran to the Reuters guy, "How the fuck do I do it?" He didn't say "fuck", Miguel never swore. They taught him to operate it, and a guy who didn't know how to operate a camera became a fantastic cameraman. He learned to operate the camera in '95, '94 in Sarajevo. And he became an indispensable journalist. He was a born cameraman, he did pure documentary work, showing the facts with all his passion and with all the rawness of war's violence. He arrived without a thing. No food, no money, nothing. Whenever he got food, he'd share it with those in need. He was great person, one of the best I've known. The image from Miguel I'll never forget is the train station at Pristina. The trains that reminded us what had happened with the deportation of Jews and other minorities during World War II. Serbs were already starting the ethnic cleansing, and he was the only one who had these images. He very deservedly received the most prestigious award for freelance cameramen. Sarajevo was his peak moment, where he saw what war was. And what he could do. But Africa gripped his heart. Rwanda was very emotional for him. Miguel, like many journalists, realized there are so many stories in Africa: War, genocide, famine. And that, for whatever reason, Africa doesn't get as much attention as other places. Those people didn't have a voice. Miguel was very tired when he left for Sierra Leone. The last time I spoke with him I said, "Sierra Leone scares me. Be careful. If you get killed, you won't eat." The Monday before his death, he died on a Wednesday, that Monday we had dinner together at a Freetown restaurant. Gervasio Sánchez, Javier Espinosa, Miguel and myself. We saw each other in Sierra Leone two days before he was killed, we went to the same... We went to the crossing where he was killed. And we found dozens of UN soldier's bodies. They were just bones by then. With UN uniforms, scattered throughout the jungle. There were 100 to 200 bodies. And he systematically picked up all the IDs from the bodies we found. It was a human impulse, so the families of the dead knew where they had been killed. Two days later, 200 meters from there, he was killed. JOURNALIST MIGUEL GIL KILLED IN A REBEL AMBUSH IN SIERRA LEONE Of everything I've lived through, the worst was identifying the body of a friend, of a colleague, knowing it was a miracle you weren't with him when it happened. He'd invited me to come with him, and I said no because I had other work to do. Knowing that if I had gone with him, maybe he'd be the one identifying me. You have to act as family, to make sure they treated the bodies of the two dead journalists with the dignity they deserved. That day I didn't feel like a journalist, or like Miguel's friend, I felt I was his closest relative. Around six or seven months later Gervasio told me, "Today I've dreamt about Miguel alive." All those months he'd been dreaming about Miguel at the morgue. Miguel was very brave and his perspective was always that of the people. There's a picture Santi Lyon took of him in Kosovo, where you see a militiaman and Miguel behind him, camera in hand. Always a person's perspective. When I see that picture, I think about all correspondents throughout history who have risked their lives, who have shed their lives in many cases. And it's a symbol of the power of journalism. Miguel is a good example for young journalists who want to do things. It's very easy, just go ahead and do it. It's turning. There it is. It's scary, isn't it? - Can you see it? - Perfectly. You can see it perfectly. Don't you see it? Oh, yeah, it's a big one. This one's big. It's armed. It's a missile launcher. That's why it's so scary. GAZA STRIP 2014 In 2014, havoc is wreaked upon Gaza once again. It's absurd, meaningless, against civilians. Once again, like in 2006, 2008, 2010. Against people who are already displaced, who are forced to live behind walls, and on top of that are being bombed. People who suffer a blockade. Illegal, inhumane and shameful. At Al Shifa hospital, which in war under-performs because there's a lack of electricity, of medicines, there are doctors who are the heroes of this story. The hospital starts to fill up with children, with old people, with amputees. Maria was at home with her mother and her sisters when an shell came through the window and killed all of them except Maria. There was also Jair Al Magari a dumb-deaf person who didn't hear the helicopter which launched the missile, so he didn't run and the shrapnel tore off... both his arms and legs. He was very tall, he was a basketball player. When he went into surgery there was very little left of him. Half of him. Rada was left paralyzed by a missile from head to toe. When I went into that room all I could do was cry. Seeing such a beautiful child... Who could only speak with her eyes. I had to leave because it wasn't fair for her to see me cry. Seeing me cry would be like looking into a terrible mirror. The anguish of imagining myself in a body you can't move, except for your eyes. Nobody deserves that. For some fucking land. What you hope for, recording these people, is that the world reacts. And puts an end to all the nonsense. Those people come back with me to Madrid. I have to cut and edit the images. They're in my computers, in my hard drives. They're in my heart, of course. And in my soul. And, well, sometimes they come back to haunt me. And they sadden and depress me. So I try not to think about it. Manuel Varela de Seijas, known as Manu Brabo, could be freed in the next few hours. I'm good, I'm fine. I'm doing great. I'm in good health, and happy, they're giving me my passport. Everything seems to go ahead, I'm fine. There's still a friend in Asturias who calls me the hostage when she sees me. Everybody knows you. It's awkward and it changes... Even at the football stadium they were wearing t-shirts with my name. All of that makes you think, "What the fuck did I do except fuck up big time?" All I did was fuck up. What's all this about?" Yesterday I was online and... And I can't believe what I saw. I don't know how to thank people or when I'll fucking deserve all of this. I had to learn to manage the person I'd become in those 44 days, which had nothing to do with who I was. There was a huge imbalance there. You feel like a Martian when you're out with friends. They're normal, I've known them forever. And... And it's really hard having a normal conversation about whatever, about my football team. About women. What happens is you start drifting and there comes a time when you feel completely apart. People don't always understand. Girlfriends leave you because they don't understand it. Friends... A lot of people do appreciate what you do and think you're brave, but sometimes I feel very lonely. When I come back I feel lonely. You need company. And friends, when you come back, say, "Tell me how it went." It's a rhetorical question, they don't really care. And you have no words to tell how it went. You're just back, you have no words. When the words come, a few weeks later, maybe a month, nobody cares what you say. I came back from my first war, my first serious war, the Iraq invasion, in 2003, and I looked at people with hubris and saying, "Haven't you heard what's happened? Haven't you read me? How can your lives go on exactly the same?" It's not easy putting up with us. And mainly we're not simple and easy... Anything but simple. We're not easy to live with between wars. That's why there are so many divorces and separations in our profession. I've been married four times. When you've just got back, you're in a limbo and you need to adjust. Readjust to normal life. Go to the supermarket, get on the underground. That's hard to do the following day. There's a psychological concept called threshold of excitement. It's the amount of impulses your brain needs to... react. Obviously, during a conflict that threshold goes really high. And then you come home and you have to live down there. So you think, "How do I do this?" That's why there's a common phenomenon that only those who've lived it understand. People think, "How can they have such a hard time here?" It happens because it takes a long time to reconnect with simple things. And some people never manage to do it. You have to decompress. You can't get home like... And say, "Hi, honey." No, because they'd freak out. I mean... We can't force that on them on top of our job and the fear. You can't force your brainfuck on the people you love. We're already forcing so much on them. We disguise it as passion. "It's my passion. I have to do it." But we're forcing something really tough on them. In 2012 I returned to Afghanistan to report on bomb-disposal officers. And when I got in that armored vehicle, on a mission looking for three new explosives, I suddenly felt I was dying, I couldn't breathe. I thought I'd die right there. I started calling out for help, but the people who were there didn't understand it. I took off my vest, I put down the cameras, I took off my glasses, the anti-fragmentation glasses, my helmet, and I couldn't breathe. I ended pushing everybody, I hit the door, they let me out, I threw myself on the ground and I started breathing. I later understood it had been a panic attack. Other people's pain and tragedies had added up, it was like a glass that had filled up and overflowed. I didn't see it coming. It exploded without warning. Back in Madrid I couldn't go to a restaurant, I couldn't get on a plane, I couldn't get in a closed car. Everything had to be open, I had to feel the wind, see the light. My head created antibodies against closed spaces. Some days living here is very hard. Some days I'd rather not live any longer. Leave everything. I can't go back there or be here. Some days I'd rather... I wasn't alive. They asked for our clothing sizes. We already had some, but more like pajamas. So when they brought tracksuits and sneakers we knew we would be moving. They took some pictures of us. The problem was we didn't know where we were going. That's when we felt moving was imminent. Up to then, even in the car, I thought I was done for. But when they take off the blindfold and you see how things will pan out, I started crying. I was in cuffs, surrounded by ten armed guys, but I thought I was out. Then you get into an Armed Forces plane and everything changes. There were doctors, psychologists, there was ham. We cut our hair off with some scissors, we hadn't cut it off in a year. Or shaved. From the plane I looked for my mom, she was the one that worried me most, but she was a champ. I'm very proud of my parents, they rose to the occasion and proved to be unthinkably strong. I'm in treatment, but trying not to have it affect my life, what I want to do. I'm doing it as best as I can, and medicated, obviously. We're here, seeing people in the middle of the bombings and shootings trying to cross the river, desperate, after coming from the other front we were at. Sometimes you think you're okay, but you come home and you wake up all nervous. With panic attacks. Sharp pain in the chest. Palpitations, tachycardia. We're in the middle of a shooting. We've been cornered unexpectedly by the Islamic State, this area was safe a few minutes ago. We're trapped between snipers. There's dangerous shelling, and they're returning from the river. You can't leave this job Scot-free, you can't just go home with your experiences and that's it. There's an emotional price to pay. You can't sleep at night. Or you wake up screaming, or dreaming with constant repetitions of a scene, like a football match replay. But it's a death match. Your hair falls. After a while you realize that's the small print in the contract. You'll live through shit and take it. And this will have an effect on whatever. Nightmares, trembling, personal relationships. If we don't talk about it among us, among the people in the know, who are you going to talk with? With Paco, the greengrocer? A Canadian psychiatrist or psychologist did some research only on English speaking journalists, and concluded that 25% of war correspondents have PTSD. The Afghan Public Protection Force is in charge now of road safety in this stretch of road. I returned to Spain in October 2014, because I was tired of being in Afghanistan. And I was diagnosed with a depression. It was as if all the exhaustion I'd built up during the almost eight years I spent there revealed itself at once. I was worn out. I felt... Exhausted, as if I'd been run over by a truck. In the year '94 or '95, also in Liberia... After really tough experiences of human nature, the immense terror and violence of war, my wife and I decided to have a kid. She couldn't conceive, and after the whole year of treatments, maybe two weeks later, three weeks, my wife got pregnant. What I've learned after all this time is that all of it will always live with me. And... What makes no sense is me going somewhere to do my job because I want those people to have the chance of a normal life, while I refuse to have that normal life when I go back home. Sure, there's trauma. You must understand that your experience in these situations has a price and has effects. But, most of all, the effect is like... It's like a glass filling up with drops and ends up overflowing. You don't know why. Most times you just have to remember you need help. Someone has to remind you that maybe there's a price to pay for what you've gone through. Journalists often don't allow themselves that. We feel it's obscene to talk about our pain with what we've seen of other's pain. That's why we refuse to recognize our pain and we consider it bullshit. But it's real pain. And there's no small pain. Pain is like a gas. No matter how small, it'll take up all available space. It's that simple. If I lose an arm, you can see it. But if I'm losing my soul... help me get it back. That's a hookah they've given me. It's quite big as you can see. And we have to light it now. Although bonding always happens, Iraq was special for Spanish correspondents, we spent many months there. We shared so many moments. We'd seen death, blood, injured children. When we got together we just wanted to try and forget. It was hard, but we tried. In fact we also tried to have fun. - Did you make it? - Yeah. In between one press conference and the next. Without those breaks, it would be impossible for a journalist to cover a conflict like that. One, two... We always helped each other, we exchanged information. And that, throughout those months, created a very special relationship. With José Couso as well, of course. We've spent the day working. And we haven't been able to sleep. We've been to a press conference this afternoon, we've gone back to the hotel, we've prepared. Jon's live connection. We've fixed the equipment, cleaned it. And now, after this broadcast, we'll go get some sleep because we really need it. José, you're an old hand at this, how's the spirit? We're fine, yeah, although we've had some scares. Yesterday we didn't sleep, they've been bombing Baghdad non-stop for eight days. At least 30 missiles have fallen in the last two minutes. All official buildings we can see from here have been hit. From here we can feel the explosions, they're shaking the hotel. I don't know if you can hear the noise, that's happening barely 300 meters from us. Some people left, a producer left. Jon decided to stay but José only had to stay if he wanted. I remember José saying, "We have to stay, Carlos. We have to be here to tell what happens, we can't leave. Without witnesses, this will be even worse than if we stay here bearing witness to the crimes, the deaths, to whatever happens in this war." Everything was going reasonably well. The offensive on Baghdad would begin on the following day, I called them and said, "I don't want you to go out on the street because from tomorrow the city is no longer under control." The safest place was the Hotel Palestine, a Baghdad hotel that stood out clearly on the horizon. And the authorities all knew that the international press was holed up at the hotel. From dawn there were already two tanks on a bridge over the river Tigris. Tanks we recorded all that morning. From the balconies of the hotel. They turned their turrets and fired against the hotel. We thought it was just an explosion, but they started shouting in the corridor. We opened the door and saw something had happened in Reuters' room. Fucking bastards! Taras Protsyuk was lying on the floor, alive but unconscious, next to a torn up window. Paul, his colleague from Reuters had a bloodied face. He was asking for help. I must confess I felt helpless. I didn't know what to do. I hadn't done first aid training, and I should have. Until an hour and a half later I didn't find out that Couso was injured. Stay awake, okay? I ran towards José on all fours, crawling, because I thought a second shell could hit. I poured water over him to clean off the blood and see his wounds, and see if there was something apart from his torn-off leg. Don't worry, we're here. He said, "Why did the tank shoot at us? Where are you taking me? What's happening? Are they recording this or not? Don't let my family see this, my kids." An unknown Iraqi gentleman to whom I'll be eternally grateful, offered his car, an old Soviet Lada, and we managed to put José inside. I told him it had to be like in the movies. He couldn't fall asleep and should talk all the time so he'd arrive at the hospital wide awake. They got in a car and rushed out of there. We immediately got together, all the journalists, absolutely overwhelmed. Then we left for the hospital. It was a long and dramatic wait at the hospital. They'd amputated his leg almost at the hip. He'd lost a lot of blood, he was very pale. And he seemed to be dying. The doctors said he could come out of it if he survived the first hour, the first, critical, 24 hours. He'd lost a lot of blood, the hospital was barely equipped. And I think elsewhere he would have probably survived. Yesterday I opened the news saying it was a very sad day. Journalist Julio Anguita Parrado had died. If I may, today is even sadder for all of us who work here. José Couso, a member of this channel's news team in Baghdad has died. I didn't want to cry during the news. I didn't want to cry, I wanted to tell what had happened, and to tell it absolutely in control. So people could realize what had happened. The Americans have killed him. They fired against the hotel where the press stays. He was injured and didn't survive surgery. By his side, the face of our news team in Baghdad, Jon Sistiaga. Jon, how are you? Well, we're devastated. Like you, I guess, and like all of our colleagues reporting from here, from Baghdad. I remember that during that week no one was ever alone. We didn't want to be alone. Most of all we tried to help Jon Sistiaga, José's partner, so he wouldn't have to find himself alone going through the sad event over and over again. I'm certain the comradery we've felt these past couple of days has increased even more. I'm here broadcasting live, but as you know, my good friend Carlos Hernández from Antena 3 was willing to do it for me, I have him by my side just in case I couldn't stand it. I clearly remember the moment Àngels Barceló from Telecinco let me speak. Introducing me as a journalist from a competing channel. But that day there was no competition, we wanted to tell what had happened. It was a huge blow. First, because Julio Anguita had died the day before. It was too soon. And second, because it was an attack against the hotel. That's an attack against an international convention that states that journalists, civilians, and humanitarians should not be attacked. José Couso's death was the biggest shock, the most moving, the most painful thing that has happened to me personally. Friendship-wise, not professionally. His death was doubly painful. Because we had lost him, but mainly because we already knew then he had been murdered. Either the American Government or its Army had decided to silence the international press working from Baghdad. What hurt the most was that my Government said, "Everybody knows war correspondents assume risks." I believe we didn't deserve that response. No to war! No to war! José Couso's death was a collective trauma. Not only for journalists, but for the whole of Spanish society, he represented all the victims. All the victims of a war people knew was an illegal and unfair war. I'll always feel the weight of José's death as his boss. It'll be with me all my life. José coming back alive was more important than all the work they could do. Much more important. It's not worth it. It's not worth losing a colleague for all the information we've produced. José Couso wasn't reckless or suicidal. He wasn't after fame or money. And because he was responsible, both personally and professionally, he wanted to be there to show it with his camera, to become our eyes. Today he's also our heart. COUSO, WE'VE ALL BEEN HIT It's tough. What's tough for people like us is compiling a calendar that doesn't have your brothers' birthdays on it, or your closest friends'. It's a calendar with your dead friends. I feel that honoring those who have lost their lives doing this job is absolutely necessary. So we can at least feel comfortable in this profession, in which it's increasingly harder for your eyes to be society's eyes. We have a job which is very useful for society. Which can or should be able to help avoid. History repeating itself, unfortunately. And it's our best weapon, we should hold on to it. We're useful, we serve a purpose. I think it's worthwhile taking risks to tell what's happening in the world. The world wouldn't progress otherwise. If right now we eliminate from our brains all the pictures, videos and information received about events beyond our neighborhood or our city, the world wouldn't be the same. Many pay with their lives, or with their health or whatever, but that's part and parcel of the job. If I were 20 years old right now, and not 61, I'd study journalism again, I'd do it exactly the same. I think it's a profession with a very promising future. But it's up to us. Telling other people's stories is one of the oldest professions. Information, talking about other people, is essential to our understanding of each other. We not only cross bridges, we build bridges, not walls. Being a correspondent allows you to witness History first hand. That's why I became a reporter, I'm fascinated by History. I'm fascinated by witnessing it, not studying it in books. And because, in this line of work, you see so many disasters and catastrophes that you understand your privilege. I always tell my kids the same thing, "Opening the tap and getting water isn't normal. What's normal is the opposite. Turning a switch on and having light isn't normal. It's the opposite. You're privileged." I do think it's worthwhile. Very much so. And it's worthwhile... For the conversations. When those people do you the honor, when you have the privilege of having them tell you part of their experience, when they decide... When you're given that privilege, it's almost mystical. It's full of truth and... Honesty. And when that happens, it justifies almost everything else. Because... It links with all the questions I have and that keep me watchful in this world. Who are you? Who am I? Why do you do what you do? Why am I here? If I didn't feel the victims' pain, I wouldn't go back to those places. The day I don't feel that pain inside, that shock inside, I won't go. I haven't lost anything somewhere terrible things happen. In fact, the only way I can transmit things honestly, powerfully, without flaws, is feeling that pain. Terence said, "I'm human. And I think nothing human is alien to me." After having had the privilege of interviewing and listening to people I admire, I'm very grateful for everybody's generosity. I hope this helps the youth that dreams of going to a war, and who experience it with the same naivety I did, are aware of things. They should do it. Each of us has a road to follow. We have to follow it and pay the price without complaining about the cost, because it's what we want to do and choose to do. But they should be aware there's a price to pay. High or low, but there's a price. Turning 45 has been a blow for me. I can't continue with my work. And I'll miss it, I miss it. Because I don't have another plan. I don't have the kids I wanted or... I haven't found a passion as great. DISPLACED GULU CAMP UGANDA 2010 War also shows us people's best side. Human nature's best side. Grandparents helping their grandchildren, neighbors helping each other, aid workers. In an armed conflict you also see people's best side. That's what keeps hope alive. Those moments at the Gulu refugee camp with kids playing, making up instruments with plastics. Kids who've had to leave everything because of war, because of Joseph Kony. But they play. Somehow they're happy and able, among the horror, of disengaging and keep on believing, and keep on playing. Being witness to that for me is also a privilege. It's an inspiration. If they can play.
