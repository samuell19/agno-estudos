Disapprove of it if you wish but I have come to get my bride. I'm entirely serious. Well then, have a good day. HARSH SEA Based on the novel by August Gailit. Screenwriter and director: Arvo Kruusement. Cinematographer: Jüri Sillart. Art director: Tõnu Virve. Composer: Veljo Tormis. Starring: Featuring: How did you think about wooing me? - Your letter. I sure got things off my chest at the fair. I also greeted you with another letter. When you replied, things were clear. I was also only sending you greetings. - Nothing more was needed. "Sending many greetings to Matt Ruhve, thinking about him. Katrina." There was a lot of warmth and reverence in your letter. Much is said but words die on the spot. However, I remembered yours instantly. So much so that I took a boat and came to get you. Perhaps you're tired? - Not yet, really. You might be. Maybe I should take a rest as well. Matt Ruhve, master of Ruhv farm. Have you come on business? - Yes, of course. I got myself a bride from afar, and now matters need to be taken care of. The bride is waiting in the antechamber to be invited in. Katrina! Matt Ruhve has been so clever as to have got himself such a lovely bride. Yes, indeed. I was not expecting that. And we would like to have the wedding soon as well. Yes, of course, of course. Matt Ruhve, master of Ruhv farm, and... Katrina Leet. Katrina Leet. Matt Ruhve and Katrina Leet wish to join in marriage. And if anyone objects or wants to be heard, they have three weeks to do so. Katrina, Epp Loona will keep quiet about the origin of all this borrowed glory. No, Matt Ruhve asked for it, I stick together with the men for a reason. Women should not engage in the more complicated game. Many children but you aren't married. - There surely have been suitors. The road from Tuultenina farm's been smoothed by many feet. Thank God. Due to my character, things always go wrong. Consistently and infinitely. I have prepared for weddings 6 times, and although it has unfortunately not worked out, some things, however, still remain. In chests in the barn, in beds in the house. Six children - that's quite something. However, I've loved them all, truly loved them, mightily loved them with another deep love like a warm gust of wind. I could only break down and ask for help and mercy from my dear Lord. May there be catch. I sent you new nets for catching eels, flounders, Baltic herrings. Catch should've been abundant. The first strong storm mashed the new nets, even took the remains to the sea. Sure, take new nets to the sea, and go to bed with a woman yourself. 15, write it down. - How do you plan to pay your debts? We discussed with the village but didn't find a good solution. - Beautiful words. I will send you new nets. You can pay the old and new costs with your catch. No, we don't want that. We've learned enough lessons, we stick to what suits us best. You rascals! You don't want to adapt to circumstances, oppose all innovations. Wow. You used stones on the bottom or had fisherman's luck? - This time lucky. There you go, a tenner. Another tenner for him. Very good, let's put it here. Wait a second. Take it. As a souvenir. Let it still stay here. You don't want to accept my present? - No. - Why? Even now, you are wearing the jacket and hat I gave you. Should Toora Jookus regard these her own, she'd better take them back. Halt! You impudent person. Providing me no joy. In Sunderland or Hull, I could've been thinking about happy times on an island. It's a shame. A shame. I invited people over for the evening. Come as well, bring someone. Put it on. Or what will your young wife think when she sees the jacket and hat here? Why, yes. On this special day, I would like to say something to Toora Jookus. First, we are very happy and grateful because we've sold our catch and it has eased our troubles a bit. Because winter seal hunting may fail, and then it'll be only income this year because we don't know wheter well boat will return in autumn. What for? Yes, indeed, what for? Toora Jookus has many ships, errands. Why should she come here? The port should be better. Why don't you build a port? A port? - Yes. For shorter travel time, for even more tourists? Too many are already arriving. - Progress. Progress must be everywhere. - It will be. Some already have a radio at home, and it makes noise all day long, talking about killings, cheating, wars, heads of state being toppled. Added to that some music and dance, and then more impropriety and crimes. The world is doing its dirty laundry in your living room. Where you are searching for peace in your mind and prayers. Life does not get any happier or easier. It has only brought anxiety. Sowing new desires, flaming up unfilled wishes. It also happens that our men already go to the mainland to get a bride. Men's business is a separate matter, our women should stay away from that. Let's raise another glass, guys. As it is an especially happy day for us, I shall raise my 4th glass and thank Toora Jookus, captain of the well boat, mate, crew, and all. There. I also used to stroke my dress fabric before my wedding to Matt Ruhve. I wonder how could you despise Matt Ruhve? Maybe I was really being a bit silly. Wedding beer was brewing, he came on a horse to take me and my dowry home. "Dear Epp, there's no getting away," he said with great grace, proud and self-conscious, and whipped the horse. I couldn't take it any more then. Blood rushed to my head and I shouted, "Stop it right there!" "I am no horse to bridle and bring home from the meadow." "Stop!" And I jumped off the carriage. I took all my belongings and brought them back to the barn. And off he went, as did all other unsuitable ones in a row. Fog is gone, it is broad daylight. Why do you have a light on? This is Katrina, wife of Matt Ruhve. - Katrina will get married soon. Quick marriage, quick end. What did she say? - Oh, nothing. Granny Lööne is so old that she mumbles double Dutch. Don't take her seriously. Quick marriage, quick end. God help me, what does that mean? Look at lovely little Katrina! She has skirts, bodices, laces, headscarves. Nobody can beat Katrina. You've got yourself a rich wife, Matt Ruhve. We envy you and we tell that to you straight in your face. We never knew there'd be such a thing. Yes, indeed, got myself a rich wife, who would've guessed. I haven't even seen all that's been put to her chests and boxes. You will have the whole day today for that. Matt Ruhve must be all smiles and gratefully squeeze his bride's hand. Now Matt Ruhve gives his bride a hug. What a fiery man he is. - And strong. He's crazy, ripping the shirt apart! Katrina resists. Shakes with fear, tries to escape. Katrina turns pale with fear. That won't do, Matt Ruhve is strong, his grip is so harsh. Katrina cannot resist any longer, no more, the poor woman gets tired. Yes, she truly can't resist any more. She falls in Matt Ruhve's arms now. - Yes. Katrina. It must be a tough day for you. I wish I could comfort you somehow but I don't know how. We've this stupid tradition of locking the couple in the barn for a day. Can't help it. Honour your status and honour your husband. Look at all this splendour, the crowd and how they've all dressed up. Women like stacks of hay with so many fancy skirts around their loins, and heaps of shining brooches, pins and beads on the chest. Something mad and extraordinary. - But you can't see it, you are blind. I see with my heart, and you see far when you look with your heart. Hitting means a horrid insult, Matt Ruhve, you should know that! I will sue you! - Already today? - Can be today! Alright, have some more fun, Toomas Andla and me are hurrying to the court. That's so impudent what Toomas Andla said about the bride. Although Katrina's not from here, she works hard, people should keep quiet. Including you, Toomas Andla. - I'm going to the court! You're at a house where a wedding is held, behave yourself, also around the bride. Grab the oars! Grab them yourself. Stubborn ones, you can surely go to the sea but I tell you, Matt Ruhve and Toomas Andla, argument must be settled where it started. Home laundry is not washed elsewhere. You weren't very clever with getting me to be your bride. You'd have found a more suitable one from the island. My Ruhve would now be with his friends and be stricken dumb with joy. You got into nothing but trouble with choosing me. Maybe I'd better leave. It's absolutely dreadful and funny how a woman goes so deep to your heart that love turns into a worry. It's tingling and hurting here. Something mad and extraordinary. My Ruhve. You smell of the sea and birches. The birches that decorated our wedding boat. Hold me, hold me close. More, more! Why are their cries so heartbreaking? The swans took the souls of the drowned ones away. And this wailing is for comforting the folks whose kith and kin have been taken by the sea. When they return in spring, they take the souls of those who died in winter with them. And each swan brings someone? I guess so. And those family members who recognise the swan and can respond, will get the perished one to return home. This is mere folk tale. - Of course. But sometimes this will also do. No, not yet. Today is a miserable day as well. Let's wait some more. Look at where you are. Don't you know where you have to be at this hour? Hey, you. Hey, why did you not come to the church? I've been praying enough this year, and singing mightily with women and children. These tiny sins should have been redeemed a long time ago. Seal hunting is about to start now. We'll be dealing with the sea, wanting to be scrupulously impartial, as it's unknown whether praying to God will not anger Old Harry. But who can tell which one of them is mightier at sea? When winds'll suddenly turn and break the ice field into a raging glacier flow, who did this then? Who should we pray to? Who? Who... Yes, indeed, who? Well! Now! To my young wife Katrina. Well done, Päärn. I knew you'd be a great seal hunter. Ice is singing. - Does this mean storm is coming? Wind has turned. Sammi, Reks, Noa, get back, get back! Guns and skins to the yawl, hurry up! Let's go. Nothing, Katrina? Still nothing? What, then? Well, what every man desires to see happen to their young wife. It might be early for that. - Don't laugh! It's not early at all. We've been married for a long time but nothing is seen that would promise happier days in the future. Happier days? The same happens, day in, day out, all life long. Even laughing is a sin. - The sea never laughs. Even God never laughs, he's always grimly serious. Why should a man laugh? - Sure! The sea is your God. - Can't help it. We're like specks in this incessant disquiet and movement, like rocks, polished smoother and, in the end, thrown to the shore along with filth.. Yet, someone needs to remain behind of everyone - otherwise, this'd be it. Maybe it's time to ask my son Iisak Loona to come and live here. Then, Katrina would remain farm mistress, should something happen to me at the sea. Nothing more to be said. There's nothing to be done. I want to stay here for all my life. Plough your field, tend animals, wait patiently for your return from the sea. Just stop staring at me with such gaze. This pierces into my heart. Tell me at least once you love me. You're looking for food supplies here as well, then? - Yes. I've looked into village barns and storerooms several times. Nothing. Just emptiness and troubles everywhere. A ship was sailing quiet waters across a big, big sea. All was quiet, still aboard, all men abashed, nothing more. A sailor had been summoned too early by death to the fore. Look at the lovely Epp Loona. She has managed to prepare real joy for us. - Yes. Nothing to be said, she must be forgiven her numeous sins. Neither his cross nor his grave covered in flowers is in sight. If only the wind would stop. - True. If only milder weather arrived, men could make their way back. There is less and less food every day, soon, we might be in trouble. Swans are singing a grieving song, long-tailed ducks hoot sadly along. Swans are singing a grieving song, long-tailed ducks hoot sadly along. Why do people go to the sea when it's so dangerous? Men have been at sea for 3 weeks but nobody hurries to their rescue. They may have perished already. Why are planes, icebreakers not called for help? You just sit sadly here. Indeed, it is already late. Night fell so quickly, I might get lost in the forest. It was lovely here, Epp Loona. Thank you for coffee and hospitality. I am honoured and grateful to have been invited. Lööne? - Old Lööne, who else. Can you see my future? I don't see a thing, I'm old and blind. Tell me, what did the words "quick marriage, quick end" mean? Go home! Faster, Päärn, throw it! - I can't. - You sure can, throw it! Get away from the boat! Save the yawl! - Oh Lord! Oops. Has Katrina fallen ill? - Not really. Better days are ahead for me. I'm alone in my distress. If only Matt Ruhve got home quicker. Yes, all are at sea, and there's lack and troubles in every home. Katrina's storerooms only have food in abundance. - And you will now take it? Of course, no exceptions. Katrina should know all her reserves are community's. As are the buildings, fields and animals. Yours aren't bony and feeble at all like in other stables and sheds. I gathered hay all summer and autumn, even dead grass, leaves under the snow. Others can do it, too. I'm not saying anything bad about you, you're a careful, hard-working woman. You've childishly been thinking more about yourself and your husband than the village. I'm sorry, Katrina. I did what our tradition and law say. Katrina. Don't sob. We might still get out of it alive. - You think? Definitely, we can't die here. What happened? - We found seal hunters on ice, guys took them to forecastle. This is Päärn. This is Toomas Andla. Eero Kuigo. God forbid, why, this is Matt Ruhve! We got out of it alive... We did. We did! Down the topsail! Damn it! Wear! - Wear. Is it evening again? Damned storm won't even let us eat. Will we perish? - Will we? - Definitely. Iisak Loona will probably get Matt Ruhve's farm, so you can stay with us and not be afraid of anything. I'm not at all afraid. - Really, you're not afraid? Right, no need to be afraid, you're expecting a child with the master's rights. I'm sorry, I didn't think about that. - I won't stay here. Perhaps it's easier here with us? - Nothing keeps me here any longer. Perhaps you hate us? I hate the sea. This capricious and harsh sea that took my husband and might take some others as well. Not for myself but for the one I'm pregnant with. Translated by Liina Kivimäe Subtitles: Mardisupp OÜ
