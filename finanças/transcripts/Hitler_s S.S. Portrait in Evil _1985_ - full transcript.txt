(Dramatic Music) apart from hitler rome is worth a whole bunch of them put together (chanting) so hoffman i think we may proceed. the child is to be christened johannes verner is that correct? no, just hans hans verner sorry i'm sure you appreciate this is a solemn occasion and nonetheless so because of the troubled times in which we now live station master albrecht hoffman you as a proud servant of the state railroad no less than your wife girder and your sons carl and helmut are gathered here today goodbye pastor thank you why did you contradict the pastor i didn't i told him it was hansen not your hands what's wrong with that i noticed you didn't contradict him when he called you station master what's that supposed to mean well it obviously means that that promotion the railroad's been promising you all these years has finally been granted by god or someone close to them if that's the kind of nonsense they teach you in university you might just as well have stayed here and been unemployed like carl if we're going to stand around here all night we're going to freeze to death yeah why don't you folks go home carl and i are going for a drink echo you bet by hans and don't forget the man in there says you have a great future and he should know it's his profession does this mean you two are going to be out all night i know unless we get very lucky new there somewhere i'll tell you here hey walter what what kind of circus have you got back there tonight a nazi circus i thought you like that kind my brother does he thinks of the wave of the future yeah well come on what happened at the meeting are you a member now or what helmet how long are you back for uh just a weekend i have to be back in munich on tuesday hello carl the last time i saw you was when helmet took me to that football match wasn't it ah the only game we lost all season what are you doing here i thought you were training to be a teacher no no no mitzi has now decided to become a singer which means that instead of just punishing children she can punish everybody that's always been the secret of helmut's child the fact that he doesn't have any you've noticed that too huh where do you do your singing wherever they'll let me do you know that please just off the bat sir i'm starting there next week fraulein templar are these fellows paying for your time or what no uncle walter you are that's what i thought you tomorrow oh incidentally how's the new brother oh he's fine and we don't need any more jokes about good tunes on old violins either don't be silly i think it's marvelous oh yeah just what we need six million unemployed and a new baby uncle walter what's happened to the lousy beer do we have to wait forever for it all right sonny if you ordered it it'll be there listen you little poison dwarf why don't you go home before somebody steps on you hey fellas this dump's full of stinking socialists or commies i don't know all pigs smell the same to me let's get out of here come on now buy a drink somewhere respectable hey guess we didn't have to pay for our drinks good evening gentlemen i'm afraid we don't appear to have a table at the moment well that's all right we want the bar this restaurant has no bar here my snap would you be kind enough to ask that young man his companion to join me for a drink how are you sit down sit down ah this must be your brother carl of whom you always spoke so well oh yes every time i tried to praise helmuth's academic talents he would say no here professor i would much rather be able to play football like my brother and is that what you have now become a footballer not exactly no ah uh what will you gentlemen have to drink ah beer rubies here meister please two beers here prophecy so how are you finding life at the university well munich's certainly an improvement on this place but i don't know as things are i sometimes wonder if being at the university isn't just a bit irrelevant but in three years yes in three years i can be an assistant professor helping to prepare other students for jobs that don't exist you don't believe in the acquisition of knowledge for its own sake not when we have six million unemployed roaming the streets now if you're looking for a practical solution i uh i must admit that uh the academic life does have a certain uh aspect of irrelevance uh how about you now that you are no longer a footballer what are you up to i'm an unemployed motor mechanic i know it it's very difficult for young people today to know what to do i must confess that i am rather happy that i'm no longer young myself speaking of solutions carl has been thinking of joining the nazis do i take it you disapprove well don't you it's not the party i would have chosen for myself but that can hardly deter carl you are his brother i should think you'd find your opinion much more relevant i just don't think they'll deliver what carl seems to think they're promising they may call themselves national socialists but if they ever get to power you can be sure you'll never see anything that even remotely resembles socialism makes you so sure of that oh i don't doubt your stormtrooper friend rome has dreams along those lines but hitler certainly doesn't i never did i'm afraid he may have a point there but i can certainly understand why you would find their uh promises new order in all this chaos very appealing you can oh yes but i must warn you you may find the price for all this good order and discipline a rather high one well i got that the nazis have better soup kitchens than all the others and these days that should be reason enough for joy good to see you helmut thank you carl good luck thank you very much why don't you have to embarrass me like that for embarrassment well he's jewish isn't he so what well that you don't go asking people like that what they think about joining the nazis i don't see why not don't tell me you don't have the courage of your convictions look if you're gonna start apologizing for things you haven't even done yet you may not be quite what the nazis are looking for anyway oh yeah but it may interest you to know that i'm not just thinking about joining them i already did i signed up this cunning little afternoon well that's fabulous now if anybody gives me any trouble i can just set my little brother the stormtrooper and don't count on it i got you all i'm gonna have scrapes as it is you drag me into don't you mean whatever listen i don't like this dump let's go hey just a minute yes you didn't you hear me say heil hitler that is not a greeting with which i am familiar is that right well you soon will be maybe you should start practicing on then hitler let's hear it don't i know you yes of course i do you're that jew professor from the academy aren't you my name is ludwig rosenberg and yes i am don't you know better than to address a man from the essay without first removing your hat now pick it up and we'll start again shall we why don't you do it yourself go on there pick it up oh oh thank you thank you very much it's all right know how i'm done i hope not you'll hardly be able to indulge in that kind of gesture if you decide to join the party well thanks again night my brother the stormtrooper eh yeah you weren't exactly a spectator yourself on the contrary that's exactly what i was and that's exactly what i'll be the next time you start something forget it come on let's go see if we can find anything open well i can see you've got a great future with the nazis huh first day in the party you start out by beating three of them up one hey oh you're too much for me have you tried the schleicher yet it's about time you had a couple of decent scars to show don't you think they're just a little bit old-fashioned hell no the girls love them that's enough do i know you what's your name hoffman helmut hoffman you could be good but you're vulnerable be careful with that left arm without balance you're always holding are you at the university what subject classics you do better to take a serious interest in fencing just a minute yes be here at eight o'clock tomorrow we'll see if we can make anything of you who's that bizarre character you don't know him that's reinhard heydrich personal assistant to heinrich himmler in the ss oh yes those people yes they tell me if you ever need a friend he'll sell you one so why should you worry he wants to make a fencing master of you knows maybe you'll end up at the olympics meanwhile he may do better to drum up some votes for uncle adolf i understand you may be needing it stop it carl what's the matter with you nothing i just got a job that's all i thought you already had a job driving for those sap no no that's just part time i don't get paid for it this is for money i'll be working as a mechanic down at the bus garage are you going to be in for supper tonight i'm sorry after the meeting not another fight with us red front people no no it's a proper election meeting they said that rome's going to be speaking i don't like that man he looks just like a pig huh i'll tell him you said sir taking yours on down to munich now i'm driving beagler he lives here oh yeah lucky lutz will be going down to hanover i'll probably be up all night here they come never mind i should tell him to keep his ss clowns out of your way damn it all man they're only ever supposed to be the fuhrer's personal bodyguard now they're ordering everybody about even me you know what it's hardly a real soldier amongst them however when hitler becomes chancellor there'll be some radical changes in that department too very radical your driver may be prettier than mine but uh doesn't seem to know much about motor cars yours doesn't look too bad either maybe i'll borrow it one day huh is fear please is hmm hello hello where's hollywood where he's in munich says he won't be back till christmas what are you drinking uh nothing for me you know the rules all right give me one of those creme de mont yes a creme de mont it's only colored water but they'll still charge you an arm and a leg for it that's all right i just got a job doing what beating up old ladies uh no no that's just in my spare time so what do you hear from helmut well not much only seem to hear from him when he wants something yes i've noticed well i liked your song only one i just got here what have you been up to in that lantern's outfit of yours i'm sure we had an election meeting you seem to be having elections every three months yesterday well this one could be important why is that your people planning a little push if they don't get enough of a little push i don't know you better ask hitler he never talks to me about that kind of thing oh hell there's steiner i'm sorry i'll have to go he's the owner wants me to meet someone who needs a singer for a place he's opening next year says it's something really exclusive you just imagine can't you thanks for coming by and uh say hello to helmut if you get a chance wake up carl the foreman's watching you what do you think it's gonna hold up well what it needs is the crankshaft for grinding yeah i can't see them forking out any money for that just make sure the bearings are all right and then we'll increase the oil pressure a bit go on listen when i took you on you said that you'd be willing to join the union that's right right you never told me you were the nazis well you never asked i'm right that's true enough don't you think it's a bit of a contradiction i mean being with the nazis and wanting to join the union i don't see why we both want the same things come on don't tell me you're one of those people who actually believes that the nazi brand of socialism has got anything to do with the brotherhood of mana or something why not because the fact is if your friend hitler ever got what he was after there wouldn't be any trade union socialist and otherwise that's nonsense it was not going to do anything to hurt the unions i like you carl once more you're a pretty good mechanic but you don't know a damn thing about politics never mind it turns out you don't have to fight about it now anyway will we have you heard been on the radio all this morning heard what for god said the elections you dummy the nazis lost 2 million votes and 34 seats in the reichstag 34. that's right that's 34 notes is about to go warm the back side somewhere else you're improving but not as much as you should tell me have you had any more thoughts about coming to work with us yes that's for the party the ss is the party or very soon will be has anyone told that to rome or his essay stormtroopers yeah they're just the foot soldiers of the movement make no mistake it's the ss that will be in control yes but apart from anything else i still have two years at the university left two years before you become what exactly some impoverished teacher of literature probably is but frankly i don't believe in the parties of allah believe didn't i care what you believe i want your intelligence not your belief you can forget about teutonic knights and germanic destiny leave that to people like himmler i'm talking about an organization that's going to control not only the party but every aspect of the state itself now tell me the truth wouldn't you like to be part of something like that well it sounds fine but i mean the party has yet to get to power and judging by the last election results that could be some time and besides i understand they're running short of funds is that a fact are you attending any lectures of vital importance tomorrow then i suggest you join me for a trip to the roar you're not lacking intelligence hoffman you're lacking information thank you kurt von schroeder controls the biggest bank in cologne the one on the right's fogler united steel the other one's bertker he manufactures baby food nice combination that's emil kierdorff he'll be celebrating his 85th birthday next week that's if he makes it up the stairs meanwhile he owns enough coal fields to keep europe warm through the next ice age our chancellor von schleicher says germany is on the road to recovery pretty won't be there to see it well how long do you think his government could last two months maybe three and then why then according to our revered constitution president hindenburg will confer the title of chancellor on someone else and ask him to form a government yes but who who indeed hindenburg will of course listen to these distinguished gentlemen after all they own the country why shouldn't they have a voice in running it here to decide who's going to be the next chancellor they already know who's going to be the next chance that's simply the price they're haggling over they think they're getting a lap dog for their money a mongrel that can be house trained but surely they'll be demanding some kind of price for their support obedient workers docile trade unions plenty of profits nothing he wasn't planning to give them already of course they'll expect to hear a lot less inflammatory talk of a second revolution from rome and his essay friends in fact they'll be expecting to hear a lot less from rome altogether do you think that's too high a price to pay well who needs revolutionaries when the revolution's already been achieved exactly hey what on earth were you thinking of it's much too old for him rubbish he understands it perfectly don't you father you should be wearing your comb why'd you think i bought it yeah oh no this no you can't do it like that you have to undo it first you'll give it to me all right no no leave it oh but it makes me look like a anyway it's too expensive everything you bought they're much too expensive you must have used your whole allowance now don't worry i'm gonna be earning some money you won't have to support me anymore you're not thinking of leaving the university i already have i turned in my books a week ago you're not going back but you're still going to teach you're still going to be a teacher aren't you no but listen i'll be earning more than i would after 10 years as a teacher 10 years are you going to be some director of a bank or something all right maybe not quite that much right away but it'll certainly be more than i get from teaching and i'll finally be doing something doing exactly what i'm going to work for a man called heydrich he's in munich and he's setting up or a heydrich you talking about the ss yes i thought you didn't believe in all that overheated nazi philosophy well of course not it's primitive rubbish but listen all that ideological nonsense those lunatics keep spouting is neither here nor there they'll probably be told to drop it when the party gets into power anyhow what now you admit we're gonna get into power sure you'll win but then you are going to be faced with actually running a highly complex modern state and those crazy idealists like your friend rome wouldn't even begin to know how it'll take practical young professionals to run this country some somebody with common sense people like you i suppose that's right people like me do you really believe all of that but of course i do why shouldn't i i don't know helmut sometimes i think you just believe whatever happens to be convenient for you at the moment oh come on hey is is in honor of our new chancellor hitler if i gave away free drinks every time we got a new chancellor i would have been broke a long time ago yeah sure you can probably remember when bismarck was chancellor yes i can then they didn't have songs to honor pimps then either the horse vessel well you're talking about horse vessel was killing a fight against the communists back in 30. i don't care if he was killed by a trooper performing monkeys he was still a pimp then all the same so what if he was in his spare time we've all got to make a living haven't we i don't see why you have a real talent for making friends don't you never mind if he makes jokes like that in the future you can probably have him shot anyway it's time i picked up mitzi from that glorified brothel did you ever look her up like i told you yeah just the ones she didn't seem very pleased with you why but for one thing she never seems to hear from you unless you're in town what's the point of hearing from me when i'm not in town i don't know you do take her a bit for granted though don't you oh you think so do you come on girls are always getting upset about something she'll be all right you want to come with me what floor to hold your hand cheer up the fuhrer says this thing will last for a thousand years i'll see you tomorrow what's that are they afraid they'll lose you no it's just a bit of nonsense i suppose it's supposed to make us feel as if we really belong what do you think will happen now well like i told you hitler will wait for hindenburg if you're going to berlin i don't suppose you'll be back here that much well maybe not not for a while what would have happened if i'd been pregnant last year but you weren't but suppose i had been well you seemed more upset that you weren't pregnant not now anymore aha so a young hoffman is off on his travels again man hello what are you doing here i just came to say goodbye to dr lieberwicz well he's leaving the country no no things haven't quite come to that yet no he's giving some lectures in hamburg all the same it certainly looks as though we're in for some bad times again doesn't it you mean the official attitude toward the jews i mean the official attitude towards everybody certainly can't imagine that the jews will be singled out for preferential treatment well i think you'll find that the anti-semitic aspect of all this will blow over sooner than you think yes that's what a surprising number of my jewish friends keep saying i wish i could share their optimism so um you're off to munich again eh uh berlin i've taken a job i'm going to work for the security department of uss yes yes you're leaving the university to enter the ss but why helmut why you do you remember that piece from goethe you used to quoted us something about making decisions you must the hammer or the anvil be that's it that's the one well i finally decided the people like us hoffman's have been the anvil long enough maybe it's time we started doing some of the hammering yes mind you if gert had spent much time in the blacksmith shop he might have noticed that the hammer tends to wear out much sooner than the anvil i'm sorry i've disappointed you haven't i just tried to do your hammering with a little discretion won't you helmet so what's happening who the hell are you what do you think's happening we're celebrating may day workers of the world unite parkmon reporting from headquarters transportation section you're late we have to send for another driver i haven't read the standard fjord to hanover last night we just got back that's right who are you rudolph language secretary you've got it wrong little man as from today this union is suspended and this is government property so go celebrate your labor day somewhere else i'll take them he needs an ambulance scrotum oh yes let's see come here come here come here will you ask him if i can have another drink because i don't think he can hear me in fact i think he's deaf are you deaf huh i think you'd better leave why is that it's all right heinz i know him i'll take care of it why don't you get us a cab oh we're gonna go someplace else another drink oh god shall we go you know what we did today why don't you tell us about it in the cab i don't want to tell you about it because because i forget that's why but i do think that we should have another drink i certainly do think yes speaking who is it helmet who do you think well how should i know it isn't as if you called every day anyway they simply said berlin and announced the obersten fewers if it were a message from god oh i see our switchboard people tend to be a bit military in their manner i suppose that's what they're paid for anyway listen i'm coming home this evening we could have dinner i see the aubergine is visiting the provinces so i get to have dinner yes all right listen carl's here i think he wants to speak to you carl what's he doing there he got a bit drunk last night i'd let him tell you about it himself all right put him on uh isn't this uh back my eyes office anymore no two doors down thanks and who are you half man assistant to heydrich another one he's got so many special assistants no one ever knows what they're all doing uh nobody except heinrich you mean exactly come on carl what have you been up to now never mind that now listen you're the one who's supposed to know everything the hell ordered that action against the unions yesterday uh i'm sorry to disappoint you but this happens to be one of the times when i evidently don't know everything i'll tell you what i'll talk to you about it tonight i'll give you a call when i get in okay bye i forgot to introduce myself becca attached to set dietrich's headquarters leap standard ah one of the fewest personal bodyguards well if i ever need anybody's shot i'll know who to come to aren't they always happy to be of service there you are where have you been there's mrs lunder in the front room she wants to talk to you here where have you been all night she says that you were at some union office where her husband got hurt or something why didn't you tell me because i just got in but what happened what's it all about nothing the union's been suspended we took over the offices that's all but why why did you do that because it's full of bolsheviks that's why communists if you like mr lungner is the communist well how should i know what he is did she say anything about me did she say how he is she doesn't know yet doctors say he's got a broken spine the police came last night they say it was an accident i'm sure they're right but we could said we should speak to you first first before lodging a formal complaint against the sa against those members of the sa responsible for mr langner's injuries you saw what happened you could be a witness my husband always speaks very well of carl i'm sure he'd be the first to help us if it were possible apparently not i'll request my section leader's report if there's something in it you ought to know i'll tell you about it that's presumably the same report the police based their opinion on right damn it carl if you don't stop pursuing this thing you're gonna talk yourself straight into a concentration camp do me a favor mitty tell him will you tell him what what i've just been trying to get into his thick head i think he's trying to tell you that the business of throwing elderly trade unionists downstairs is too important to subject the discussion amongst the rank and file of the essay and whose side are you on anyway listen as things stand longer is still entitled to a pension you start stirring things up and they'll probably decide he doesn't even qualify for that your name will stink and he'll starve is that what you want listen it wasn't just some isolated little event you know it happened all over the country and it was ordered by the parties yeah in that case maybe it's high time we had the second revolution there isn't going to be any second garbage collection sooner you realize it the better for you yes why is that because if rome doesn't stop talking about taking over the army and antagonizing the entire establishment there's gonna be one hell of an explosion and when the smoke clears you'll have disappeared you know who's gonna get rid of him the ss rome has been hitler's personal friend longer than any of them hitler doesn't have any personal friends oh come on drink up this place is too expensive for us to be wasting the good wine remember the first night we were here the night i told rosenberg that you were thinking of joining the party when was he amused he wasn't offended if that's what you mean i suppose you know they kicked him out of his job last week what how do you know who told you my landlady's cleaning woman works for what the hell does it matter who told me you talk as if it was some kind of big surprise to you all right i'm sorry it wasn't a surprise i just thought he might have had the sense to retire before it happened you'd have found that less embarrassing would you get this man i'll see you outside i trust the hair stream fiora found everything satisfactory to you oh why yes of course excuse me yeah well he found it adequate look i can keep the change anyone would think i kicked rosenberg out myself well i think your ss people can take on the sa you really think your roman is bulletproof yes that's marvelous news we'll be with you for breakfast come in oh hoffman you won't be getting my sleep tonight you have to be in munich by seven o'clock tomorrow morning yes sir anything else sir tell me is it still your opinion that the essay have become nothing more than the party's garbage collectors so you think alfiero has neglected and betrayed his old comrades do you don't you sir i was beginning too often i must confess i was beginning to but that's all going to change now we're meeting with hitler tomorrow rome and all general officers of the sa this time it'll be the army and those damn politicians that'll be dancing to our tune for a change all right hoffman i'll let you know where to pick me up just a minute you know you should be an officer by now probably would be if you weren't always so damn provocative you stand easier langer business for instance demanding to see your section leaders report did you imagine that would do you any good no sir i thought it might do mr langner some good and did it all right never mind come in do you think that the army finally believes that rome is about to move against them no i don't think they really believe it but i'm sure they'll be very happy to have been persuaded of it and having been persuaded of this clear and present danger will they tolerate whatever measures we may think necessarily well if they've already agreed to cooperate presumably they'll tolerate anything that appears to be in their interest yes that's what i think too tell me hoffman is it your intellect or your relatively humble position that causes you to agree with me on this occasion perhaps both perhaps you mean perhaps we ought to promote you in order to really find out so go on get out stand by in your office this could be a long night well my friend things are finally beginning to happen i've just been told to take two companies at the leap standards down to munich the furious personal bodyguard i thought he was in the rhineland yeah he's meeting with rome with the rest of that essay scum in the morning all of them and rome's hometown of the lake the entire leadership oh um remember asking me about ever wanting anyone shot well maybe now's the time if you've got anyone in mine thanks if i happen to think of anyone i'll send you a telegram if i'm going to be stuck here all night i'm going to need cigarettes no no no no i'll get them if anyone wants me i'll be about 20 minutes yes i'm sorry i was asleep listen this car there yeah no what are you talking about well it has been known hasn't it i'm sorry to disappoint you but he doesn't make a habit of staying here any more than you do all right all right but listen this is important have you seen him at all yes i saw him this afternoon he said he was going to munich tomorrow driving bigger yes i suppose so why see if you can find him don't call the neighbors tell him yourself tell him to report sick tomorrow do whatever he wants but stay home what's going on what's happening i can't talk now just tell him and tell him to keep his mouth shut i'll try and call tomorrow oh oh i so i'm i have a message for you what's your name my name what the devil do you mean my name i'm groping fury beagle get out you're under shake him arrest what about then can i leave him there put him in with the others tell these people who i am they know who you are but i haven't done anything what have i done what have you done what have you done you're a traitor all traitors you're going to be shot all of you shot yep good now we can finally get moving inform your duty officers that all further instructions will now qualify as direct orders from the fiora himself bring me gildish clelson eric ministry of transport see to him personally then report back to me i shall need you again later klaus numbers involved with rome 2. not that i know i know but now we have the opportunity we might just as well be thorough get me keller and heidemann ready hey damn it's a hell where did you idiots learn to shoot chancellor has condemned you to death sentence to be carried out immediately but dietrich you're my friend the fuhrer would never do this i can't believe he would do this believe whatever you like what about rome fiora is a man of great sentiment he may decide to pardon him ready hey lovely fiona hi hitler hitler indeed pure theater what pity we couldn't provide him with a better audience hoffman speaking i thought you were going to call me back we haven't heard from carl since someone says the sa has been disbanded or something do you know what's going on uh no i don't but i'll certainly try and find out should i call you later no don't call me i'll call you at home okay yeah goodbye don't worry if i know carl he's probably decided to stay on in munich and get good and drunk cheer up another 24 hours and our little house will be in splendid order the situation in munich has been resolved the fuhrer is still vacillating about rome but the others have all been dealt with no problem with the uh rank and file were you expecting any well they'll grumble a bit but when it comes to the point they'll do what they're told everything in order yes sir good good the fiora has just got back from munich i'm on my way to the chancellery now do you have any thoughts just the question of rome sir yes well one naturally admires the fuhrer sense of loyalty but i'm afraid the full support of the army won't be forthcoming unless rome is properly disposed of yes that's guring's view too but i think the fiora feels that losing rome might upset the balance within the party well then perhaps the fuhrer should be reminded that the balance within the party is whatever the fuhrer chooses as for rome well as our young friend here once observed who needs revolutionaries when the revolution has already been achieved did he now incidentally if the furore were to be persuaded of the necessity of eliminating rome who would you suggest as a reliable person to make the arrangements how about i care like camp commandant oh yes of course what am i thinking of i'm sorry the last few days have been very trying iker miker i care of this prison i have to tell you that this really is most irregular irregular bit damn it's a direct order rome arrested and dismissed you have forfeited your life the furore will give you one more chance to draw your conclusions you have 10 minutes excuse me but what am i to do about this prisoner he does not appear in my report what's the charge that is the problem he has not been charged but i believe he struck an ss officer did he did he indeed i'll let you know what about that other prisoner why don't you send it to icaru maybe he can teach in some manners hello hoffman you fancy singing horse wrestle dear so what time is your train back 7 20 won't they even tell you how long they're going to keep him there i told you they don't have specific sentences at what they're pleased to call re-education you get out when they decide you're ready for it but why can't i go and see him that man you worked for heydrich he could get him out couldn't he if he really wanted to i already told you i'll talk to him it isn't exactly easy it's mitzi she's picked up hans at the kindergarten it's really been a tremendous help to me you don't seem to realize it's gonna be bad enough telling heydrich where carl is never mind asking him to do something about it i didn't know you'd be coming i just took the day off to come and tell him about carl i have to go back in an hour or two would you like some coffee no thank you isn't there anything you can do i don't know why the both of you have to keep going oh not me i didn't put him there in the first place did i you hungry and listen to fellow peterson may be a degenerate but he's got a good nose for food like it is genuine black bread straight from the officer's mess don't worry i don't have to do any favors that you wouldn't approve of all right nice out wait a minute there's a man dead here we decided to stay in this place bring him up around corner in the morning i was wondering if i could um raise the subject of your brother in dhaka i'm a little bit surprised you didn't bring up the matter sooner or did you perhaps suppose we might remain unaware of the situation well the fact is the fact is that by security people have already looked into it they tell me that your brother is relatively harmless given the right direction he could even be of some use to us unfortunately a release from dachau is solely at the discretion of the commandant nevertheless nevertheless surely an official request from this office issues orders not begging letters anyhow i have no intention of having my personal requests on file with an ambitious dwarf like is that perfectly clear yes sir on the other hand if it amuses you to see ike yourself you can give him my regards if you like i imagine he'll be interested to listen to what you have to say i'm sure he's quite aware that his name is on our files as well and if he should let you have him make sure that your brother learns to behave himself or you might find that you're running short of friends yourself so reinhardt tristan eugene heydrich sends his regard say funny i almost thought he didn't like me do you think i'm being too sensitive here so hoffman we haven't really had time to get acquainted have we never mind perhaps you'll come back and see us again sign this what is it it confirms that you've been well treated that you won't discuss this place with anyone after your release i'll hit that did you want to eat i'm going back to berlin i just came by to let carl know that i spoke to the people from the garage it seems we have some influence there we all right the ss if you prefer anyway they say you can start there again next week do you think that's what he wants what else can he do i don't know but you might have asked him first you don't understand they're going to be watching him now if he doesn't settle down and stay out of trouble they could send him straight back to dhaka they who's they helmut you mean your people don't you you mean the ss look i don't like some of the things that have been happening any more than you do but the only way you're going to change anything is from the inside you're not going to change anything from the inside on the country they're changing you where do you think carl would be now if it weren't for my position in berlin one day you'll wake up and find out you're no different from the rest of them and meanwhile you won't have changed a thing oh really and how is it you know so much about it have you added political science to your other accomplishments no i just know because i used to be in love with you you don't have to worry about carl making any trouble i don't know what they did to him in that place but he won't even speak to anyone all he wants to do is play with hunts well anyway tell him about the job good luck so uh may i come in yes of course of course come in by all means i welcome i know it's not quite up to the standard of my old villa the longstrasser but as you probably know your people i mean the uh the authorities decided that it was too good for me and so they confiscated it i'm told that they're going to auction off the contents in order to pay for their uh expenses yes i know i managed to buy back a few of your books most of the best stuff had already gone i'm afraid but elective affinities i wonder what goethe would have to say now well anyway i just thought you might like to have them nice you you're very kind to think of it very kind indeed i'm most grateful the fact is i only really seem to feel like reading newspapers these days uh even your uh national socialist one well i suppose i should oh may i offer you a cup of coffee i've become very good at making coffee no i really must go well uh thank you for the visit it's always good to see old friends why don't you just i mean have you thought of emigrating where would i go i don't know england america what would i do there teach of course i'm afraid the study of german literature is not going to be a very popular pursuit in the near future don't you agree besides it's rather late in life to learn a new language anyway i'm much too german i would probably get homesick the latest reports from paris indicate that the life of ernst von roth third secretary of the german embassy there who was shot two days ago by the jewish student gruntspan is still hanging in the balance rights minister dr joseph goebbels said today why didn't you tell me you were coming is anything wrong no no no i just got a couple of days leave would you rather i stayed in berlin hello hans you've been promoted how do you know that can't you see he's right though i didn't have to do anything very clever for it it happened sooner or later anyway can i see your gun no not now oh go on let me see it hans if you want to go to your meeting it's time to go and wash your face in a minute no now so what's been happening you tell me you're the one who always hears everything first well how's carl goes to work and comes home he never talks never tells anyone what he's thinking well at least he managed to stay out of trouble did you hear the radio today about our man at the embassy yes and that poisoned dwarf goebbels is playing it up for all it's worth isn't he do you think there'll be trouble well i don't know but if i had any jewish friends i'd certainly advise them to stay home for the next few days hans can't wait to join the hitler youth ah well you won't like that will you i don't know perhaps it'll be better than him being unhappy because all of his friends are in it and he isn't have you seen anything of missy huh nothing at all she's got a job working at a club in munich you know oh yeah so they tell me well come on carl there must be some news in this hole rudolf longner finally died yesterday if you think that qualifies as news who's rural of london he was the foreman at the bus garage the job in the wheelchair yeah what was the matter with it he had a broken back having a broken back isn't good for you i want to make a statement what at least tommy knight yes concerning the death of rudolph longnecker of what address buckmonstrasse 27 logna backmastrasser isn't that the fellow used to work at the baskaras didn't he just die a couple of days ago yes of injuries caused by members of the sa in may 1933 just a minute now what's your name tough one carl hoffman that's it yes hoffman what are you talking about that case was closed years ago my statement's going to reopen it listen son i already know your name but i can just as easily forget it i've learned to forget a lot of things these last few years why don't you do the same and go on home i just want you to take my statement now listen any statements i take here go straight to the gestapo they won't like your story they won't like you either do you really want to end up in dakao schumacher come here and witness a statement well huffman how are you my old friend fine no tell me when do we last see each other anyway i don't know march that's right just after we went into austria wasn't it yeah it's a funny thing you know germany gets bigger all the time and yet the world itself seems to get smaller is that a thought of your own or are you quoting from a book i should have read no no ah the fact is i had a call from a friend in stuttgart this morning uh fritz ritter maybe you know written is with the gestapo isn't it well as far as stuttgart's concerned you could say he is a gestalter anyway guess who's being interrogated right there in his office your brother carl you know a character your brother isn't he what's he supposed to have done now you didn't know well he's been making rather nasty allegations about something that supposed to have happened way back in 33. tell you the truth all right i think fritz will just soon drop the whole thing but um i mean after all what's the point of sending young carol back to dachau trouble is um princess got a bit of a problem there well surely he's free to do whatever he wants yes of course but that's not the problem now his problem is uh rather similar to yours what you might call a family matter see fritz has this brother in laura wants to join the ss and i i think he'd be a real asset but the point is he can't produce that aerial family tree they make so much fuss about at least not one that goes right back to 1800 it's not his fault of course but uh there are some distinctly non-aryan uh skeletons in this particular cupboard which makes membership of vss quite out of the question well you want me to talk to heidrik about it no no no no that wouldn't be a good idea at all no but um on the other hand you do have access to uh idle brands department don't you they deal in those genealogical certificates i bet you could get fritz a really nice one couldn't you let me think about it uh i uh i told fritz i'd call him right back well it could save a lot of wear and tear on your brother too it's going to take time i'm sure fritz can wait for a week or two ah stood guard double seven double one please hello frets becca here listen um that problem you were telling me about yes yeah i just talked to him it's all settled yeah so now you can just uh drop that hoffman thing can't you i see it's already on your books what listen um he must be just about due for military service around there anyway yeah right well why don't you just give him to the army a little early exactly why deprive the country of another soldier who knows we may be needing people like that before long fine thanks fritz you know if you and i really cooperate there's probably no end to what we could achieve when i am a golden day oh will make us young this is thank you we hope you enjoyed our entertainment ladies and gentlemen that's all we have for you tonight oh one thing i almost forgot someone asked me a request would i sing the polish national anthem anyone know it you know well no matter it'll be obsolete by christmas anyway like the jews where have you been what happened to you you know i know i called helmet in berlin after girl told me you've been arrested is it awful it's better than doc huh sit down how long are you here for do you want a drink ah sure i'll have a beer please well we're just outside of town i have to be back in barracks tomorrow night brandy this is carl a friend from stuttgart hello now we really know there's going to be a war there's an idiot from the armed services entertainment department over there next thing we know we'll all be in warsaw making jokes about the polish navy did he offer you a job what do the nazis want me for they have enough clowns of their own and hitler thanks and i heard you saying well yes what did you think you know what i think oh why don't you two nauseating lovebirds go home go to bed do it for the fatherland leave me to adjust my machias in peace i'll go and get my coat good night putsy see you tomorrow thanks nice and hit loop maybe there won't be a war after all i'm not until tomorrow anyway tell me hoffman have you been doing anything reprehensible recently not that i'm aware of well if you had you'd certainly be aware of it wouldn't you but our people in berlin persist in having doubts about you they seem to feel you lack a certain this dedication just your manner all the same is best to keep it in mind poland take a good look in a few days it will have ceased to exist the fury's already given the final orders however in the interests of world opinion it will be a good thing if the poles are shown to be guilty of extreme provocation we have therefore arranged for a number of incidents there in gladwelds for instance on the night before the outbreak of war our radio station will be attacked and captured by a detachment of poles they will broadcast some inflammatory propaganda and then retreat back again across the border also at least it will appear i take it these marauding poles will in fact be people of our own 150 ss offices in polish uniform and are too capable of broadcasting in polish of course 150 isn't there a danger that some of them will eventually talk no not at all now in order for these incidents to have credibility these poles of ours must suffer a few casualties that's where you come in providing suitable bodies is gestapo muller's responsibility however mueller tends to be a bit crude i don't want the entire area littered with a bunch of dead clowns i want corpses that look like polish soldiers you will therefore select seven suitable candidates and deliver them to where would the selection take place you're familiar with black how are you hey john beg to report prisoners ready for inspection sir really steve this is just to keep the goods on ice so to speak until we get them the gliders we'll provide them with some convincing bullet holes when the show opens thank you hello hoffman keller tells me the tanks are only have you heard of anything oh by the way fritz sends his regards three twitter i'll get started my friends let go his brother-in-law has just been objected to the officer school in branchwork amen congratulations hoffman i just heard from muller he said that the goods that you delivered are just the thing i notice here though that you selected only one political prisoner all the rest were from the habitual criminal category is that some kind of indication of your political sympathy or is it simply that you think that criminals make much likelier-looking polls you have been listening to the ever-popular man later in the program we shall be playing you some selections excuse me later in the programme with what's up have you seen carl hoffmann oh no i thought i was too late i've got to tell you can't think of anything else to be coming back for can you hey come on often the poles are waiting for you let's don't worry now as our panzers roll onto warsaw poland must pay dearly for her continual and unprovoked aggression against germany which culminated in the cowardly attack on our radio station in glyphics shortly before the outbreak of hostilities in countless towns and villages our boys are greeted as well-known liberators from the polish regime that has consistently persecuted the german-speaking population for those struck and backs people yes this section has been extremely thorough is he submitting reliable figures yes admirably so we estimate that of all the so-called upper classes in poland only three percent remain to be dealt with did you get by the boots from shredders yet oh i did these chargers closed they took them away what do you mean they took him away he's not jewish is he well don't look at me i have nothing to do with what happens here in stuttgart and anyway if you're talking about the schroeder i remember the one that used to be a socialist i guess he just couldn't keep his mouth shut the old fool should know better do you really believe that billy i don't believe anything what has it to do with belief nothing i'm talking about reality god in heaven you're talking about one silly old man if you had any idea what they are doing to tens of thousands of people believe that why don't you why don't i what go on why don't i what resign you don't understand anything nothing if you're writing to carl you better give it to me she keeps thinking kyle will be coming home soon but from the way our traffic's moving east the railroad people reckon will be starting on the russians any day now what do you think what yes probably who knows so you're finally back eh i don't know how you do it do you manage to fiddle more leave than anyone in the ss so tell me what illicit pleasures have you been pursuing this time huh well speaking of pleasures a similar scent for you yet no what for well naturally is reassigning a lot of hydrax assistance do you mean to say you didn't know you see that's what happens when you spend all your time on leave you don't even know what's happening in your own department what heidrick's leaving for prague he's just been made rights protector of bohemia nice title eh it's very grand what does it mean well i suppose it means that checks are going to get a good kicking and if heidrick isn't taking you with him you better help him has a job for you or you'll find yourself fighting russians heydrich seems to think quite well of you in fact you could almost describe him as your guardian angel we shall obviously have to find something worthy of your talents very good i'll let you know by the way this brother of yours has he been behaving himself i take it he must have been sir i believe they've made him an officer oh and now i have a wonderful surprise for you we bring you an enormous expense all the way from hollywood california america's darling shirley tempah oh i'm so sorry last monday the furu declared war on america so surely can't come it wasn't monday it was tuesday we have our own darling from berlin the wonderful mitzi templar when i am oh my oh expecting someone else i never knew what cold was hello you come here often no use my telling you to go home to bed this time is it what a perfect time for me to go sightseeing i'm told this village is an absolute gem of soviet architecture better hurry the truck will be here for us at midnight drive so hoffman you've lost your guardian angel eh this is griffin phil dr bess currently attached to the foreign office he's interested in the measures taken concerning the murder of reinhard heydrich i shall be appointing you to keep him informed yes sir what is the situation present it's a matter that hasn't previously been my department sir nevertheless it is now and i presume you have at least kept yourself informed as i understand it some ten thousand persons have been arrested and a further one thousand two hundred executed in addition the village of lititze in which the assassins were believed to have taken refuge has been liquidated and the inhabitants it was the inhabitants i was referring to sir uh why don't you close that door the bombers will be here soon enough without you showing them the way what's that freight doing on siding five eastbound rerouted from frankfurt but hanover will commandeered the loco there's no way we get it shifted before daylight there are people in there aren't there yes i know jews from holland look don't worry about it where they're going they're in no hurry see you in the morning you hope the berlin train is just pulling in now it's about time too uh listen uh do you know anything about that freight on siding five yes it's ready to roll as soon as the burning train clears the line good they fix the tracks all but the down line for frankfurt working on it now it's been quite a night eh doesn't it just oh thanks you took your time the way you people are running the trains it's a wonder i'm here at all my relief will be hidden you want to wait we can walk down to the house together fine i'll get some coffee the damn train took 12 hours i'll see you in the hall yes this resettlement can you tell me where they're going to send me don't worry you'll like it next jewish what took them so long getting round to you no system is quite perfect i suppose rosenberg eh rosenberg you taught my brother gerhard gerhard oh yes very intelligent boy he was killed at smolensk sorry so now you're reporting for resettlement don't you know what resettlement means yes you're ill unfit to travel go home disappear if anybody asks you show them this take it next on your own headband come on with that shortcut my brother carl's at starring grad in spite of the enemies suicidal attempts to react to this believed city the iron will of the german soldier in the streets of stalingrad is once again justifying our viewers unshakable faith in the unswerving loyalty of these people who are those people partisans partisans well why don't you ask them come in so you're one of the boys has been suspendedly trying to leave our people in uh stalingrad eh yes well i can't understand is why they should detach you from your regiment at the present time and post you to us would it be because of your political opinions i think it probably has more to do with the fact that my regiment no longer exists hmm let's hope you find your time with us more profitable i'll see you in the most later we make quite a tradition out of celebrating new year's eve oh gentleman it is nearly midnight and before we usher in the new year i would like to suggest we observe a minute of silence to honor those comrades that have fallen just a moment sir we're doing this all wrong you remember sir you're supposed to change uniforms with the newest officer in the mask mustn't break with tradition all right all right what am i going to say well the colonel is about to request a minute of silence for all of our comrades that have fallen in battle this last year that's a good idea very good but as you know our fuhrer the greatest general of all time has been kind enough to take over the conduct of this war himself and if his performance at stalingrad is anything to go by perhaps we should add a couple of minutes for the poor idiots to be slaughtered next year as well i'm serious i'm serious that's three minutes of our time right three minutes just think if we were being asked to observe a minute for all the people that we've slaughtered and our friends in the ss have slaughtered i spend the rest of our lives in total silence i want this man transferred to a punishment battalion yes sir but i don't think that's all together justified i want it done by morning chance nine months ago they're happy to leave me for dead these days something like this practically quality is a one it's sending me back to the front it's your unfold i should cut it off why aren't you seeing me again in all right yeah don't be so sure they'll probably prop you up in a tank good luck but another truth they won't be seeing me again in a hurry either oh meyer meyer in 1940 hermann goering said if the british ever bombed berlin you can call me meyer make way for the degenerate please hal hitler i don't know where you find your nerve doesn't take much nerve to play the fool being a messenger boy that takes nerve otto wants me to carry an envelope to his underground friends and flutters down here's to comedy and all its practitioners and who might they be hard hitler don't look now but i think we're being ignored how do you do i have just heard that carl has not returned to his unit do you think he's hurt no damn fool is deserted i don't know where the hell he thinks he can go but if he should get in touch with you turn for god's sake to steer clear of balloon i'll let you know if i hear anything why wasn't i introduced oh she's just a family friend from stuttgart not your type at all and who's the old fairy with her he's a comedian quite funny but they tell me his jokes tend to be a bit political oh he's harmless just likes to sail a bit close to the wind hello that's what i like about you you greet me as if you're expecting somebody else i want you in a shelter i hate them it's like waiting to die sorry what time is it day six what does it matter you don't have to go anywhere anyway do you i'm not today anyway i gotta keep moving it's the only way to survive but how can you live that's not the problem i even have rationed documents to feed an army travel documents to transport one but helmut says they're looking for them they've been doing that for nearly a year you're surprised how much of the scarf the second country i've seen in the last few months but if you're listed as a deserter and they get you military police can only discover that if they hold you long enough to check back with somebody else otherwise if your papers are good if you don't let your face get too familiar then they believe you're in transit because your papers say so yeah let's eat we'll talk about it later brow line templar well labor yes what is it is it important i'm just getting dressed no no i'm sorry i was just listening to the radio they say there's going to be an important announcement i thought you might want to listen oh yes thank you i'll do that we now bring you an important announcement from the rights minister of information dr joseph goebbels men and women of germany shortly before noon today thursday the 20th of july a group of despicable traitors made an attempt on the life of our fuhrer adolf hitler by placing an explosive device in his front line headquarters the chief perpetrator of this treacherous act the country stolfenberg i can now tell you that because of what i can only describe as divine you idiot why now why today well i wanted it to be sooner but the trains aren't running on time anymore you know what's happening on there i can imagine they're arresting everyone on site it's gonna be the night of the long nights all over again do you have any travel papers i'm supposed to be in transit to munich and that's where you better go now no i want him to stay here you can't they've already arrested your comedian friend that's impossible but he's got nothing to do with all this it makes no difference he's on the list they'll get the name of every soul he's ever known that means they'll be coming here you better sleep somewhere else tonight both of you he's right trouble is every time you're right homewood everything gets worse but he wouldn't tell him anything he wouldn't talk everybody talks how can you say you don't know any names you know your name not you all right let's start again your name my name is gerhart this gentleman's name is becca and this man is hoffman now let's see what other names we remember shall we or perhaps you prefer to tell us some more jokes why don't you see what you can do i'm afraid our friend just retired from the entertainment business maybe he just didn't know any more jokes so if you're looking for the hoffman's they're not here anymore they were in there both of them what about the boy boy oh no he wasn't there then hunts went to berlin long before that berlin the volkswagen boxster you know the new defense force they've said yes yes i know are you sure he said berlin yes hans tomizer himself said he was going to defend berlin to the last round or something i think there were some brothers too uh my name is hoffman i understand someone is looking for me are you sure ah what the hell are you doing here you must be out of your mind did you know that hans was in the volkswagen that he's here in berlin yes he's in the barracks of dawn he's 13 years old do you think i don't know that some of the boys out there are even younger what the hell can you do you can get him out you can get him out and you can get him the hell out of berlin you bring my friend the hop stream if you're a large schnapps and how carl how do you imagine that i can punch you in that house oh sir that's how you have people shot tortured beaten to death but you can't make a 13-year-old boy disappear i've never done those things no no nobody we've had other people doing it for us now you're going to get hands on yourself look those kids will probably never even leave the barracks in any way how much longer can all this last you've been saying that for 12 years don't worry carl it won't last what did you say when they crippled longer what you said when your people murdered the last of the opposition don't worry carl it can't last i'm going to change things from the inside right it's probably what you told rosenberg isn't it don't worry professor nothing lasts forever but we were wrong helmet they're all dead all of them and we might as well be too and it is going to last forever all right carl i'll go and get him i don't know what good it'll do but if that's what you want does he know about his parents yet an air raid two weeks ago both of them do you know what someone said to me today enjoy the war the peace is going to be terrible did you see mitzy she all right she should have left berlin long ago she had some weird idea that you want to stay where you'd be able to find me i'll meet you there both of you you and hunts all right but for god's sake be careful those lunatics out there are shooting deserters on sight you better let me go first hello hunt hello now listen i only have a few minutes you see that corner over there do you think you can get away to meet me there after dark i don't know they say we're going to the front tonight yes i know that's why i want to get you out of here you want me to run away no no now listen you'll be coming with me we can go home don't you want to go home but i can't i'm a soldier we're going to defend berlin the owner of our people shut up you idiot what are you a parrot i'm sorry hans but it's all gone there is nothing left to defend you're going to dessert too aren't you stop talking about deserting don't you understand anything it's all over you'll be getting killed for nothing you pig i hate you you're a traitor just like carl you're all traitors alright hans leave it now we'll go home and go home together give me my rifle going back to your friends i'm sorry it seems we taught our little brother too well perhaps you're right perhaps this thing really does last forever but what are you going to do well they say the imperial guard is supposed to die with the emperor though i think you'll find my source will just crawl back into the woodwork you'd be surprised how many new identity papers will be showing and everyone beyond reproach you say hello to mexico identity papers don't i know you
