The tent is blowing away. No! Anne? Anne? Is anybody home? Peter? Otto? Edith? Margot? Anne! Where is everybody? I'm getting scared! Good grief! I don't think we can open the museum under these circumstances. What do you mean? These people have been standing in the rain since 5 a.m. We cannot give in! Give in? To who, the Nazis? We have another five minutes to go. Let's move the diary to Anne's room, it'll look authentic there. Are you coming, or what? Looks natural here. Well, of course. She feels back home now. "She"? - The diary. I call her a "she", after Anne. June 12, 1942. Dear Kitty, I hope I'll be able to confide everything to you, as I have never been able to confide in anyone... Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Happy birthday, dear Anne Happy birthday to you What are you waiting for, Anne? Open your presents. Slowly. - Oh, Mont Blanc! I miss skiing. - We all miss skiing. 4711! I don't believe it! Don't exaggerate, Anne. Anne, stop it! Wow. That's so lovely. Oh, Father, it's lovely. Don't thank me, it was Mother. - Mother? Mother! - Shh. Keep your voices down. All right, now carry on, but quieter. Take the gifts into your room. Margot, Anne, go on. Margot, can I ask you something? - Yes. Do you keep a diary? - That's none of your business. Margot, the truth, now. - Sometimes. Sometimes? Then why is it such a big secret? It's not a secret at all, it's just private. And... when you write... Yes, when I write... - Who do you actually write to? What do you mean? To myself, of course. Like talking to yourself? - Yes, I suppose it's like that. Except in writing. You don't have to write to yourself. You could write to Queen Wilhelmina, or your beloved goddess, Venus. Too pompous. I prefer to think of my diary as a girl. A best friend. Someone gentle, refined, a good listener. I'm thinking she'll have Hanneli Goslar's radiant face, but not as naughty as her. And Jacque van Maarsen's slim figure, and her deep blue eyes. Veronica Lake's hair, and Ava Gardner's lips. But she will also have my spark, my smile, my wisdom, and, of course, my sense of humor. I will write my diary to this girl of mystery and her name will be Kitty. What do you think, Margot? Kitty? Hm... I like it. Why did you choose that name? I just felt like it. That's what I wanted to be called when I was little. Who are all these people? - Movie stars Anne admired. I don't know any of them. Of course you don't, darling. They were stars long before I was born. That's hard to imagine. You always seem so old, like from before the Bible. Why stop there? The Stone Age. I'm an ape from the Stone Age, remember? All right then, the Stone Age. Anne! Anne! - Annie! Anne! We know you're up there! We saw the lights go on. Come on down. The war's over! Aren't you sick of hiding? How long are you gonna stay up there? 80 years? 100? Anne! Annie! Anne? Anne, I'm here. Come down, Anne, I'm waiting for you. Why are you hiding? No one can see you, you're my imaginary friend. Who is that? Is he a boy from class? Of course. - Who is it? I don't remember you telling me about him. That's Sam... Sam Salomon. He's madly in love with me. Come down, Anne. He's a tough guy, but he's a brat. Tough, eh? Well, he's certainly good-looking. Yes. But you'll see, Father will chase him away in a minute. Sam? What are you doing here in the middle of the night? Don't you have a home? It's dangerous to be out this late. If I were you, I'd go see him right away. Even now, in the middle of the night. Well, you know, he's not the only one. What's that supposed to mean? Up until a year ago, everyone was in love with me. Everyone? - Of course. Everyone. All the boys in class. Well, maybe not everyone. But let's see. Rob Cohen was in love with me since first grade. But I can't stand him, he's a baby. A hypocrite, a liar, and a crybaby. Herman Koopman is just as rude as Rob. He's still in love with me, but he flirts with all the girls, which drives me crazy. Why? I can't stand not being exclusive. Say, Anne, you wanna go with me to the movies tonight? Albert is very intelligent, but he's not mature enough for me. Sam Salomon, I've covered him, haven't I? Sallie Springer likes to spread rumors about how he's already done it. Done what? You know, done it with the girls, gone all the way. As if! And Maurice Coster is wrapped around my little finger. It was all so wonderful, but then everything changed. The Nazis came to power in Germany, and they took over most of Europe and marked us Jews as the villains. They told everyone we were to blame for all the world's problems: disease, hunger, poverty, you name it. Then, the restrictions. First it was the swimming pools. After that it was... everywhere. We were banned from concert halls, shops, sporting events, parks, hospitals, universities! And then they imposed a curfew. We weren't allowed to leave the house between sunset and sunrise. We thought life couldn't get any worse. That's when the children started disappearing. They'd send a letter ordering Jewish kids to report to the nearest police station the next day. It said something about a work camp for children, but we never saw them again. Sallie Springer? - Absent. Maurice Coster? Absent. Herman Koopman? Absent. Anne, I don't understand. Why did they pick on the Jews? What's their issue with Jews? Why the Jews? Why not? For all of human history, people have always found a minority to blame for the bad things that happen to them. The Gypsies here in Europe. The Armenians in Turkey. The Namibians in Africa. The Apaches in Mexico. Should I go on? No! No, I get it. Anne, am I Jewish? No. - Why not? Because I made you up. You only exist in my imagination, and since you're in there and I don't want you to be Jewish. Period. What does it mean to be Jewish, anyway? It means making a decision. - That's it? Making a decision that you are taking on the Jews' destiny, and their history. Well, then, I don't care what you say. I've made my decision. I'm Jewish! Who are you talking to, Anne? No one, I'm just writing my diary. We're ready to start. Come on. You know, of all the restrictions, the worst is not being allowed to go to the movies. Who's that? That's an actor, his name is Clark Gable, and you wish you could marry him. That is correct. We have to leave tomorrow. We are not giving her up. We're not ready, let's wait a few days. Absolutely not. God have mercy on those children. Not a single one of them has come home. Not one! Stop the film and tell them to start packing. Anne, what is it? I heard Mother and Father talking. A letter came, this is it. It's the order, it's time to report to the police station. Time for who? Is it you? Me. Maybe Margot. What difference does it make? We're leaving tonight. - Where to? I have no idea. They were talking about a hiding place. Anne... What about me? - What about you? Well... What will happen to me after you're gone? Gone? - Gone from the house, I mean. Are you kidding me? Even if Father says we can only take one thing each, I'll choose the diary. Anne, here is a sack for you. Please pack your most important belongings. Then dress in as many layers as you can. We're leaving. Where are we going, Mother? - Oh, darling, you will know very soon. First thing in the morning. Shouldn't you take something useful? We're going to a hideout. What could be more useful there than my memories? Morty, I think this might be the last time I'll ever see you. Father didn't tell us where we were going. I feared the worst about our hiding place. What if it was an underground hovel where we'd spend years without daylight? Or a monastery, where Margot and I would be sheltered and never see our parents again? So, imagine my surprise when our long walk ended, and we arrived at Father's office, where Miep and Bep, Father's most loyal workers, were waiting for us. Bep, I'm so happy you're here. It was a small factory manufacturing stabilizer for jam. Now, of all times, when the country is at war, you need your jam to set in no time at all! You won't be hiding right here in Father's office. Come with me. Wow, Daddy, what is this place? - Shh. This secret apartment is going to be, from now on, our hiding place. Now this room here will be our room. I mean, Mother, and myself, and Margot. Up there is gonna be the living room, and the van Daan's family room. The van Daans? Are they coming too? Yes, of course. It's important to save any lives we're able to. You are a lucky young girl, Anne. The only one with her own room! All persons located inside the Anne Frank house must surrender immediately! We do not wish to resort to violence, but any damage inflicted on Anne Frank's diary will be construed as an attack on national security! Come on, boys. Go, go, go. - Check upstairs. Look under there. - This room is clear. My God, Madame. You really got the nerve, hiding all this. Check under there. Clear. I think this is a false alarm. I can't see anything. - We have to be sure. Keep looking, boys. Excuse me, can you see me? Excuse me? Can you see me? Am I real? Oh, you're real, for sure. You are real. Do you know where I can file a missing person complaint? Sounds to me like you need the police. There's no way I'm talking to German police. Nope. Just forget it. I get it. In that case, I'll direct you to the non-German police. Can I see some ID, sir? Get in the truck. Come on. POLICE Excuse me, where can I file a missing persons complaint? I told you, wait in line. - What line? What's your name? - Ava. Did you also come here to file a missing persons complaint? Missing? Yes, my grandmother misses me. Wow. How do you do it? My father, he's a sail maker. You're next. What can I do for you in the middle of the night, young lady? I wanted to ask about my friend. - What about her? She's disappeared. I want to know where she is. What is your friend's name? Anne. - Anne. Does she have a last name? Yes. Anne Frank. - Aha. Anne Frank. How long exactly has she been missing, that Anne Frank of yours? I got up this morning and... Got up where? - At home. And where is home? - 263 Prinsengracht. You mean the Anne Frank House? Of course, who else? I looked for Anne all over the house and she wasn't there. People keep coming into the house, nosing around her stuff, looking at her diary... No respect for privacy! But she's nowhere to be seen. Oh... And it's not just Anne. Her father, Otto, and her mother, and her sister, they're all gone. Aha. I see. And what did you say your name was? Kitty. - Kitty? Do you have a last name? Just Kitty. Anne's Kitty. - Aha... All right. Follow me, please, Ms. Kitty. Now listen to that, Sergeant Platt. This young lady here, named Kitty, is looking for her missing friend, Anne Frank. What's so strange about that? You know how many girls here are named after Anne Frank? You see that, Kitty? And that? And that? All that is Anne Frank. All that... All what? - Everything you see. That's the Anne Frank Bridge. And over there is the Anne Frank School. And you see the big lights? Tell her, Ms. Platt. What are the big lights? Of course, sir. That's Anne Frank Hospital. And that's the Anne Frank Theater, of course. It was just renovated last year. Are you pulling my leg? It kind of sounds like what Anne's mother says about God: that he's everywhere. Anne Frank really is everywhere, and she gives hope to all people. And she also... I guess she is a bit like God, yes, in some ways. Yes? Yes. Aha. Aha-aha. What a coincidence. It seems that we just stepped outside with the person you're looking for. Hey. Hey! Hey! - Young lady! Stop! I know you've got the diary! - Stop right now! I'm shooting! I will shoot now! In the air! I'm shooting! In the air! Hey, Peter. Hey, Dirk. Hey, Sandra. Looks like you guys had a good day at the office. Damn good day, Peter. You're not Peter, I know Peter. Okay, I'm not Peter. Who are you? I'm Kitty. And I know you. You're that sneaky little thief from Anne's house. Oh yeah? - Sure, I saw you working. Japanese wallets. Expensive taste. I like that. Anyway, I'm looking for Anne. Which Anne? - Anne Frank. You're Kitty, and you're looking for Anne Frank? Well, isn't that nice. Hey, Dirk, Sandra! Come over here, you gotta hear this. Meet Kitty, she's looking for Anne Frank. Have you seen her? - Sure we've seen her. Everything is Anne Frank around here. Anne Frank Bridge... Stop it! I've heard it all before. Anne Frank Bridge, Anne Frank School, Anne Frank Theater... Boring. Kitty... - What? It's like you stepped right out of Anne Frank's life. With those clothes, you could be some kind of... Can I have a go? On the ice-skates. Sure. Take Sandra's. She's about your size. Listen, babe, if you push it here, it's for the ice. If you push it back, it's for the road. Shadows and lights Will lead me to the blue again I'm longing, so longing for them To lead me to you again Peter, bring me the diary. What? - My sack. The sack with my stuff. Been so long, so long They long to cry I'm in my room Asking why Take me home. Where is home? - Anne's home. Please, Peter. Please, take me home. You mean, Anne Frank House? The museum? When does it open? - At 8 a.m., in six minutes. Blue again My longing, my longing Are you cold? - What? Do you feel any pain? What does that mean, "feel pain"? Excuse me. I have a girl with a high fever here. She's delirious, clear the way. Dearest Kitty, Today, Mr. and Mrs... Anne! - Just a second, Mother! Anne, what's taking you so long? Everybody's been waiting for hours! Come downstairs. Why don't you go down? - I can't stand her! Your mother? Mother too, of course, but she's not my biggest headache right now. I told you, it's Auguste van Daan. Or "Madame," as I call her. She just sits around on her fat derrière feeling sorry for herself all day long. You should've seen them when they arrived... The minute they walked in, I took one look at what they'd chosen to bring into hiding, and I realized what kind of things are important to these people. If I have to die here, I shall die like a gentleman. Peter, come down immediately! I can't, I'm dying. Peter never comes down. He's always up there in the attic, "dying"! Could be a heart attack, it could be lumbago or cancer, you never know what he's dying of. He just continues to die. And "Madame", covered with her fur coat, she thinks she's on stage all the time. Hermann, I tell you, I shall die of malnutrition in here. My days are numbered. If I have to die, I shall die as a lady. But Anne, maybe Madame really is hungry. Oh please, we're all hungry. - I know, but... I mean, she is really hungry, and hunger can mess with people's minds and make them do crazy things you could never imagine. Oh yeah, such as? Well, if things really get bad, she could sell all of you to the Nazis for a single potato. So what are you saying? - That you have no choice. You have to give her more food. Anne, you're talking to yourself again. Everyone's waiting. Ah. - Ooh. Now that Her Majesty's arrived, may we at last begin? Go ahead, Mr. Hermann. Just don't gobble up all the food at once. Anne! - What? Peter, come down, please! Why do you bother? He's probably dying up there. Anne, please. - Anne, what? What? Go on, tell me, I'm waiting. The food's getting cold, I'm spoiled, I talk to myself in my room like a two-year-old? What? Dear girl, this food is hardly worth fighting over. I, for one, have no intention of touching the cabbage. So you may divide up my portion. Peter, come down, please! I can't, I'm dying. But why, Madame? I was just about to offer you my portion. Cabbage gives me gas. That is true. - What's true? Cabbage gives her gas like you cannot imagine. I tell you, I wake up at 4 a.m. every night, thinking it's a Luftwaffe bombardment. But no... Exactly. And gas could alert the enemy. If someone on the street were to hear your farts, well, we'd all be dead! Listen to you with all your petty grievances while there's a war raging out there. It's that cat again. He'll get us all turned in. Margot, go upstairs and ask Peter to come down. I'll go. - No, Anne. Margot, you go. Anne, dear, is it true that you have all sorts of characters whom you talk to when you're alone in your room, feeling sad? How did you know? - I know you better than anyone. Do you remember, in the good old days, how we used to go to the opera and the theater? I'm talking about the shows that were really unusual and full of imagination, like... "Tales of Hoffmann" or the "Wizard of Oz" movie with all those colors. Exactly. All those fantastical stories. Perhaps you could use those characters in your head, make them fight your war somehow? These fantasies and your beautiful imagination will help more than any medicine could. Hop on! Yeeha! Kitty? Kitty? Kitty, I know you're in here. Can you hear me? Keep your voice down! Kitty, come out of the diary. Come to me, I'm waiting. This is no place for you. They'll hunt you down like an animal. They don't understand who you are. Come to me, you know where. - Hey. This is a Holocaust museum. Behave yourself, young man. I'll wait for you, Kitty! Come find me. We've met before, haven't we, Peter? Yes. - Remind me. Burglary. A year ago. Anton's corner shop. I stole some milk from a morning delivery. Do you believe in ghosts, Peter? - No. Then why do you come here to talk to Kitty's ghost? The girl is posing as the Anne Frank friend. She's no ghost. She's for real, she is Anne's imaginary friend. Oh yeah, sure, for real. As if! You've got a nerve. Are you in love with her? I sure am. Head over heels. Peter, don't be a smart-ass. That girl is a true danger to the biggest spiritual treasure this country has produced since Rembrandt. And if you are the person who leads me to this so-called "Kitty", you'll go down with her. Dear Kitty... Anne, Albert Dussel has arrived. Please, welcome him nicely. I can't be nice. I'm not going to pretend. Why does he have to be in my room? Because there's no other place. We've talked about it, my dear. For every person we welcome into our hiding place there's a good chance we are saving a life. If we could, we'd let another 20 people in. But what about my privacy? You'll have your time alone, I promise. Don't believe him, Anne. This new fellow is a real danger. Why do you say that? He's a dentist, for God's sake. - So? So dentists are a bunch of sadists. They make their money hurting little children. But they also use laughing gas and pain medicine. Maybe this man will take away all my pain and fears with his magic gas. Ugh. Dream on. Anne, allow me to introduce Mr. Dussel. He is a physician, and he will share this room with you. Now, if you'll excuse me. It must be a bit of a shock, I imagine. You know, Mr. Dussel, there's a fair chance this is where you'll spend the rest of your life. Now, close your eyes. Excuse me? - You heard me. Close your eyes. Imagine you're in a hotel. A magnificent hotel called Hotel Kitty. Why Kitty? Because it's my hotel and that's what I'm naming it. Hey, you're not closing your eyes. It's a small hotel. More of a sanatorium, really. It's in the Swiss Alps, surrounded by trees and glistening lakes, a place fit for royalty. A very quiet place. - Yes. Nightly rate? Free. Menu: fat-free, completely. All the meals are extremely low-calorie. How low? As low as possible. Breakfast is served at 8 a.m., before the employees arrive. Lunch is at exactly 1:30, dinner is at 7:30. What happens in between meals? Study time. - What do we study? Anything we want. Now remember, Mr. Dussel, this is the most important rule in the hotel: you must not talk, or walk loudly or flush the toilet between breakfast and afternoon tea, which is at five o'clock. What happens at five o'clock? That's when the employees downstairs go home. Apart from the three collaborators thanks to whom we are here. What if someone breaks the rule and cries out in agony? Very simple. We all die. There's only one voice that's allowed to be heard. The radio. In other news: British Foreign Secretary, Anthony Eden, vehemently denied today's report of the transfer of prisoners and citizens by the Germans to forced labor camps in the East. East? - It's a figure of speech. East. It has become evident that all those children who were supposedly recruited to work camps are not at camps at all, nor are they working. They are taken "East". This "East" sounds like the scariest place on earth. It must mean Poland. They say the Germans have built labor camps all over Poland. Some say there are extermination camps, too. Extermination camps? Whatever does that mean? They separate men from women, children from adults. Whoever is too weak or too old to work, they kill. - But those are just rumors. No one's really come back and confirmed that. That's exactly it. No one ever comes back. Good morning, everyone. Please turn to page... Drink this, darling. It will calm you. Everything is all right. Here, drink this. - What is it? Cod fish oil. A very rare find! It will relax you. No, please. Just leave me alone. Look what I've got. - What? Brewer's yeast. I can't believe I found it! It's the best natural anxiety killer ever. Take some. Oh, Daddy, I don't want that evil doctor sleeping next to me. He's not a doctor, he's just a dentist. My poor Anne, Albert is not to blame, he is just a messenger from the world outside bringing us news. Exactly, darling. And the news he brings is only gossip. There's no proof of it. Think about all that is good. Think about how fortunate you are to be here, safe, with all those terrible things going on outside. Let us all try to think about positive things. Such as? Think how many countries have fallen to the Allies since we've been here. Just a little longer, and they'll reach Holland. I heard that the British War Commission has suggested flooding Amsterdam with snow melt from the canals to drive the enemy out by the sea. I can't stand her! Which one is it today, Madame, or your mother? My mother! Whenever I feel bad, she says other people are worse off. She can't hug me, or feel any empathy, nothing! I can't understand why Father married her. He probably fell in love with her. Why else do people get married? I assure you he never loved her. - Of course he did! Otherwise he wouldn't have had children with her. But you know, grown-ups always stop loving each other after a few years and a few kids. They just can't keep their love going for so long. All grown-ups fall in love once in their lifetime. Oh! And the more the love is desperate, the more they increase the chances of getting hurt and eventually being dumped. Now, once they're dumped, the one who saves them from the bends is the one they marry, but it's certainly not the one they love. It's pathetic, but it's common knowledge. So why worry yourself about it? Because... because if what Albert says is true, if we're going to be separated, I want to go with Father, not Mother. Kitty? I know you're here, and I know I'm not some lunatic who imagined you like that delusional cop thinks. Listen to me. It took me a while, but I figured it out. As long as you're here in the house, with the diary, you're invisible. When you leave the house, with the diary, you come to life! You're real. Except it doesn't last if you get too far from the diary. Remember, the diary is your heart. It's your pulse, your life. And if it's not near you, you just vanish. I mean... you die. Give me a sign that you understand what I've said. Kitty, what's the matter with you? Are you crazy? Come back to the house, now. Come down with your hands up immediately. Kitty, run! Run now! Up there! Hey... Huh? Anne Frank School, Anne Frank Hospital, Anne Frank Theater, Anne Frank Bridge. Madame! Madame van Daan! Hey! What are you doing here? Girl, do your parents know you're sitting under a bridge at 3 a.m.? Or did they send you out to sell drugs to tourists? Here you go, honey, go buy yourself a hot dog, it'll do you good. I repeat, young girl, bright red, curly hair, clothing inappropriate for time and place. Define "clothing inappropriate for time and place". What are you, an idiot? I did define it. Picture Halloween, and someone dressed up as Anne Frank's best friend circa 1940. That means nothing to me. Take out your cell phone, Google "girls' clothing 1940", then add red curls onto whatever you see. All my life I had a little light Little light Light inside A little light, little light Burning, burning, burning bright Burning, burning, burning bright Ooh. One moment. Listen, babe, I don't care where you lifted these bracelets from, but you know they're worth a lot more than these clothes, right? How much more? Around a thousand times more? I don't care, it'll serve her right. Huh? - Madame! Can you imagine she was hiding it for all those years? Anne Frank Bridge. Anne Frank Theater. Anne Frank School. Anne Frank School! Shh! Dear Kitty... I'm not going down today. There's nothing left anyway. There's always something to survive on. Not anymore. Yesterday, there was a raid on the black market. What's that? Is that where you buy spoiled food? No, silly, not at all. The black market is where you buy food secretly, beyond what the Nazis ration. Everyone buys what they can afford. It's an illegal market. At first, Mr. Kleiman went there every day, carrying a doctor's bag with a false bottom. Remember the day we celebrated Hermann's birthday? Yeah. Kleiman somehow smuggled a whole cow, butchered into quarters. Oh. Ooh! Those were the days. - Yeah. To think that was only six months ago. Yes... And now it seems like 50 years. 100 years. An eternity. Anne? - What? Why do you think you made me such an ugly redhead? Excuse me? You heard me. Why did you make me an ugly redhead? Do you know any Jews with red hair? What nonsense. Where did you come up with that? You're the most beautiful girl ever! You're lying. You made me ugly so you could feel confident around me. Like a popular girl who surrounds herself with unpopular losers! I wanna get out of here! Out where? - Out to life! Kitty, I'm so confused. I mean... I made you up. You only exist inside my head, you can't get out of here. Not unless you really, really want me to. Let's say to go and bring you some medicine. Or to find out if those children who get on the trains going East ever come back. Stop, stop it now. No more talk about the East. Think about it! That's why you made me an ugly redhead so no one would suspect me. Look at me now, Anne, and see me walk right out of here. Wow. It's like the movies up here. I know. Maybe your favorite stars can be in the movie. What do you see in all those stars? They're so far away. I see hope in them. And I have my army of stars. They fight for me. Why did you come up here? I... I was hoping you could track someone for me. I mean, in this amazing reflection you have here. Someone? Someone I lost. Who, a friend? Well, it's complicated. She's more of an imaginary friend. It doesn't matter. Is Mouschi male or female? - Male. He looks more like a pregnant female. See. This is the male sex organ. He doesn't have testicles, because the vet fixed him. It's funny to say "male sex organ". How else would I say it? - I don't know. There are other names for it. - Other names? What other names? - I don't know. I'm not blushing, am I? - No, of course not. So, Anne... What will you do after this great victory? I'll be a famous author in Paris. How about you? I'll be one hell of a gangster. Every so often I'll rob a bank so I can go on gambling. I think I have to go now. Anne... Yes? I was thinking... Do you think you might want to come up here tomorrow? I mean, in an arranged sort of way. Are you asking me out on a date, on my birthday? I don't know. You can call it whatever you want. Anne! - What? It's your sister. - What about her? I think you should go see her. Why? - Now, please. It can't be. - What? Are you jealous of me? You, of me? Because of Peter? I don't believe it. I am jealous of you, yes. But... not because of that. Not because of Peter? - No. I'm jealous of you for being able to express your emotions the way you do. I'm jealous of the way you can be angry and get annoyed at Mother. And lose your temper at her. And dare to love Father more. And cry when you're scared. And escape from this place into your imaginary world whenever you want, and not care what anyone thinks about you. I'm jealous that you don't have this role that I have. What role? - The role of "the perfect one". I just can't take it anymore. Excuse me, Miss? - Yes? Look, there's a problem here. What sort of problem, exactly? Well, it says here... In fact, it says so in some of the other copies I found on the shelf, in all of them, actually. Yes? What does it say? There are all sorts of asterisks next to things Anne wrote about Edith, her mother. Here, for example, it says: "Version 2 was removed from the first diary by Otto Frank." Yes, and? Well, what nonsense is this? Anne's father never read her diary. Of course not. He didn't even know Anne was writing a diary, but when he came back from the camps and heard that the girls had died... The girls died? What girls? You know, when he heard that Anne and Margot had died at Bergen-Belsen. What's wrong, my little girl? Are you trying to say that... that Otto was the only one... to survive the war? What exactly happened to all the others? I mean, how did they... What grade did you say you were in? Wait! Here, take this. It's Otto Frank's book. You'll find everything you need to know about what happened to Anne. But read it only after you've finished reading the diary. Anne Frank Bridge, Anne Frank School, Anne Frank Theater. Anne Frank Theater. Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you Happy birthday, dear Anne Happy birthday to you I want you to have this. Wear it tonight so you can feel like a real lady. Just like you deserve, on this special day. It's our date, remember. Let's go up to the attic. Can I borrow your flashlight? My flashlight? Yeah, sure. Dear Kitty... What do you see, Peter? I see the Allied Forces, they're coming to liberate us. And you? What do you see? I see angels, Peter. Do you think you'll love me just the same when we get out of here? That depends. - On what? On how my heart adjusts to freedom. Anne? Peter? What are you doing up there? The broadcast is starting. Red Army Forces have successfully broken through the German blockade, crushing their defense lines and inflicting hundreds of thousands of casualties. Calm down, please! Surely you don't want to be caught now! That marks the beginning of the end of the war. More than a million Russian soldiers gave their lives at Leningrad, and a million more of the city's residents. One third of its civilian population died of starvation. But tonight, as we greet the new year 1944, the battle moves from occupied Europe straight to the heart of Germany... Wow. Oww. For the Netherlands, and to all other victims of German aggression... You slept for so long. How long? - Two days. No, I mean, how long have we been here? More than two years. Would you like me to leave? - Why do you ask? I thought you might want to write. - Oh... Yes, that's nice of you. Thank you, Albert. You have a fever. - No, I don't. It's the hunger. - No, it's the realization. What realization? That this is not going anywhere. It would've been better not to hide at all. Better to die than to nurture the hope that something good might happen. You're afraid of what comes after. No, I'm not. Because if worst comes to worst, I'll see the after world from the Greek mythology. A pure paradise, surrounded by five magnificent rivers. And Peter? - What about him? Doesn't he offer some sort of hope? No. I was just hungry for friendship. I needed someone to listen to me, but I can't really fall in love with Peter. You don't really think that. - What I think is, if people are basically good and kind but use their powers to make bombs and planes to destroy each other, then what good is all this? And what chance do I have of surviving anyway? Ultimately, deep inside, I believe that human beings are good in their hearts. Liar! Anne never said that! Oh yeah? And how would you know? I was there! Oh, you were, were you? Yes, actually. I was in the room when she said that. And her words were: "It's amazing that after everything we've been through, all the human evil, I still believe that deep inside human beings are good." - Wow. Don't touch me, you evil man! - You go, girl. It's her! She's the girl who stole the diary! Lock the doors! Yay, yay! Hey, Kitty! Hey, Kitty! Come on, now! Go! Come on, Kitty. Follow me, quick. They're all over the place. How did you find me? I realized you were following some sort of plan you were mumbling about when we first met. Anne Frank Bridge, Anne Frank School. Next was the theater, right? - Exactly. There's been a change of plans. Kitty! Hey. Hey, guys. Kitty! Kitty, how are you? - Hey, Ava! I'm so happy to see you again. What are you doing here? - Hiding. Hiding? From who? - From the police. What is it? - A zeppelin. A zeppelin? - Yeah, like a big balloon. My father is making it, so we can fly away in case of trouble. Omar! Come back to the building, it's dangerous outside. Who are all these people? - Refugees. And what does it mean? It means they managed to run away from war zones and their homelands. Tell her, Ava. We didn't even know there was a war going on. One lovely morning, soldiers invaded our village. After two hours, the village was burning. We run, and run, to the open sea. There was a storm. My father, the sailmaker, saved us from drowning. Then we landed, seeking shelter. In Spain? No. Italy? No. Switzerland? No. France? No. Belgium? No. Then we came here, we were sure we will get shelter here. They never got it. - Why? Because, this country decided that it's safe to send them back home. Ava, dinner is ready! Peter? - What? Why didn't you tell me that... Anne died? Not only Anne, but everybody in the house, except her father. I tried, but you wouldn't listen. It seems everybody knows who Anne is... was, but no one talks about what happened to Anne. She died. - How did she die? How were they caught in the Secret Annex? Who framed them? What happened after she was caught? Does it matter? - It matters to me. And I'm going to find out. Are you coming or not? "Anne was happy when she sat down on the train to Westerbork Camp. It was an ordinary passenger train, full of travelers on their way home or on holiday." "After two years in hiding, it was the first time Anne had seen sunlight, heard birds chirping, seen landscapes changing, and a soft sunset." "Anne was happy, until she slowly began to understand that this train was not taking her to freedom, but to what would become a horrible nightmare." "Westerbork was a hard-working camp with terrible conditions." "But still, Anne's spirit was high, because we all had hope that freedom is just around the corner." "At last, Anne had some beautiful moments with her mother at the Westerbork camp. A friendship blossomed between Anne, and Margot, and Edith, and for the first time in her life, Anne was filled with love for her mother." "The West was liberated, and it was a matter of weeks or days until Anne and the camp would be set free. We just had to survive a little longer, stay out of the train transports to the East. But we were unlucky. We were transported on the very last train, ever, to leave this camp. Those who survived that train, survived the war. From here on out, there was no more suffering. What happened from this point onward, to the next camp, was no longer connected to life as you know it." Peter, can you read this, please? It's just too much for me. "The last train to the East pulled away from the platform horribly slowly. It was a cattle car, with only narrow slits instead of windows. We were lucky to stand behind the cracks in the wood, as we were probably the last people who could still breathe some fresh air." At least I know that while she was on the train, Anne had her beautiful imagination to fight her fears with. Anne believed in the Ancient Greeks' version of the afterlife, the Underworld, which is surrounded by five huge rivers that must be crossed by ferry. At the entrance of each river there was a station, more and more people, departing from their lives, were boarding the ferry. According to the Greek mythology, before facing the god of the Underworld, they had to depart from all their belongings, and only then, Hades, the god of the Underworld, would decide who stays forever and who still has a chance in the next river. And that's where it ended? This time, the only people left heading toward the very last river in the Underworld were Anne and Margot. Do you know who that is? Of course, it's Hanneli. Anne's best friend. When Anne and her sister got to the camp, they were no longer suffering. They were just waiting for the end. Once they left Mother and Father, they had no hope left. We met next to the fence. Anne still had that mischievous spark in her eyes, but it faded every day, faded and faded. One day, Anne came and told me that Margot, her sister, was gone. The next day, Anne didn't come. She... She was gone. My dearest Anne... Kitty, wait! Miss, the site is closing now, it's six o'clock. I'll have to ask you to leave, please. Kitty, we have to go. But if I leave here, it's the end for me. No! It's the diary that gives you life, not this stone. Anne's life ended here, but her dreams came true. She became the youngest famous writer ever. And you're here to keep telling her story. The good parts and the bad parts. Families Bau, Bari, Yakita, Yawundi, Yakubu, Zakuti. Please pack all your belongings. We will be back tomorrow morning to take you to the airport to complete the deportation procedure to take you back to your home countries. We are keen to avoid any form of violence, it is just a legal procedure. I repeat the names of the families. Families Bau, Bari, Yakita, Yawundi, Yakubu... Hi. Kitty! Did they call your family name? - Yes, they did. Don't worry, Ava, we will never let you go. I think I have an idea. Do we have spray paint in the building? What do you think? Hello. Oh... Hello! Hello? My name is Kitty. I am Anne Frank's imaginary friend and... I am the person who stole the sacred diary written by Anne. If you do not stop the deportations of refugees, I will drop this diary into the burning barrel below. Anne did not write this diary so that you could worship her. Or name bridges and schools, and theaters and train stations after her. No. The pages themselves are not important. What is important, is the message passed down to the tens of millions of children who read this diary: "Do everything you can to save one single soul from harm. Just one soul. One soul of a child is worth a lifetime." And that... That is why I shall burn this diary, unless all of these people are granted shelter and the guarantee that they may stay in this country as free people. For as long as they wish. I may look brave, but I'm scared. There's still time, you know. I can take you and the diary to Anne Frank House, where you will live forever with your powers of invisibility. No, it's too late for that. I'm not worried at all. I can feel it in the depth of my being. Feel what? That now you've completed your journey, you will have your own life. You don't need the diary anymore. Do you really believe that? Kitty, I love you. I'm not going anywhere without you. Kitty, can you hear me? Kitty, are you there? It's been decided that these buses, which were supposed to take the deported families to the airport, will now take them to their new homes in The Hague. But first, we need to have the diary in our possession. Don't do it, it might be a trick. I've seen things before. The diary will be handed over to my friend Ava. She will be the keeper of the diary until the very last person in this shelter will be granted a new home in this country. I trust a lot has changed since Anne's days, and no one will dare to harm Ava, not even for the sake of the precious diary the entire world is looking for. Kitty, stay calm. Of course no one will harm Ava. Start sending people out. Trust me, Kitty, no one will touch this diary until the very last family is registered. You are my hero, Kitty, and I will love you forever. What happened to the girl? - What girl? The girl who stole the diary. - Oh... She vanished. I feel so cold. I'm freezing. That's a good sign, my love. Do you think three hours without the diary is enough to know? I think it's forever now. Kitty? Kitty! Kitty! Kitty! Kitty! My heart, it knows A loving soul It's hard So hard Letting go I try, I try Painting the sky With heavy wings Colors they sing to the wind The wind The wind passes me by My nights, my days Float by like waves My heart, it drains But my mind, it sings I try, I try Painting the sky With heavy wings Colors they sing to the wind The wind The wind passes me by My heart, it knows A loving soul It's hard So hard Letting go I try, I try Painting the sky With heavy wings Colors they sing to the wind The wind The wind passes me by I try, I try Painting the sky With heavy wings Colors they sing to the wind The wind The wind passes me by
