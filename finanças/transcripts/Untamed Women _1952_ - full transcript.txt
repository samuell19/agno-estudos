(dramatic music) - [Man] Our greatest problem was to remove this clot pressing up against his brain. The pressure was so great that it caused almost a total blackout of his memory cells. - Certainly not like the usual amnesia case. - Nor battle shock or fatigue. That clot was produced by some terrific blow or tremendous explosion which could burst a blood vessel. (light clicks off) Anyone reading his case history would say he belongs in a psychopathic ward. A lot of wild hallucinations, garbled words. Not a bit of sense from the day they picked him up till we operated. And after that, he lapsed into a state of complete unconsciousness. - What about the operation itself? - Surgically successful, but as to the result on his mind, we don't know that yet. That's why I asked you here today, Professor. If the experiment we try with a new serum works, he may be able to bridge that mental gap and tell us the whole story. - Mm-hmm. - As an archeologist, you should be able to tell us whether his story is fact or fancy. As a matter of fact, Washington is quite anxious for a decision on that point, too. Well, I think they should be ready for us about now, Professor Warren. - Well, tell me, Dr. Loring, what happens if the new serum doesn't work? - Well, that's one of the unpredictables in this case. He may never recover. - I have everything ready, Doctor. - Good. Steve? How do you feel? I asked Professor Warren to be here. - I hope you don't mind, Captain. - Do you still want to take a chance and go through with it? 10 CCs. - Yes, Doctor. - Keep your fingers crossed, Professor. If he talks, it'll be the first time since the operation. Steve, listen to me carefully. Relax, and don't be frightened. I want you to start counting. Start counting backward from 100. It's all right, Steve. Let's try it together. 100. - 100. - 99. - 99. - 98. - 98. 97. 96. 95. - Steve. Remember Lucy, Steve? - Lucy. - Yes, Lucy. Steve, start from the day you took off on the mission. - The mission? (fan whirring) We got a call for a one-bomber scout mission the morning of May 3rd. With her four motors rolling, Lucy bounced along over the Pacific like a ballet dancer. It was about three hours later that we saw it. A nice fat enemy cruiser right below us. They began spitting up all the hot lead they had, but Lucy danced right through it. While Benny, our bombardier, was getting ready to drop our calling card. - Boy, oh, boy! This is the prettiest sight I've seen since I left Brooklyn. Little old eggs, do your stuff. (bombs whizzing) - [Steve] Those eggs were a pretty sight going down and despite the heavy flak, we put them right in their living room. Right then that flak caught up with us and Henderson, my copilot, was badly hit. Lucy's number two and three engines were knocked out. When one and number four stopped reading, I knew she was dying fast and we'd have to ditch. Pilot to crew, pilot to crew, lighten the ship, prepare to ditch. Pilot to radio, pilot to radio. - Radio to pilot. - Make an SOS and keep going till we hit the water. - Yes, sir. - Pilot to navigator, pilot to navigator. - Navigator to pilot. - Get your compass ready, Andy, we're gonna need it. Get up here with a first aid kit. Henderson's been hit. - Right, Steve, I'm on my way. - Pilot to bombardier, pilot to bombardier. Blow up your water wings, kid, it's gonna be awful wet outside. - A situation that could only happen to me. I personally sink an enemy cruiser and now I have to swim home in order to tell about it. I can't swim. (thrilling music) - That's all, here it comes! (thrilling music) (thunder rumbling) - [Steve] That night a storm hit us. For a while it was really rough. About all we could do was hang on and try to ride it out. We lost our compass and most of our equipment. Sometime during that night, we lost the other boat. We never saw it again. Ed kept the emergency transmitter going on the chance that help might be somewhere out there in the night. I sent up a flare, but it was no use. Henderson was getting weaker from shock and exposure and there was little we could do for him. The storm continued into the next night and that night we lost Henderson. It was grim irony that he died and was buried at sea just as the storm ended and the morning dawned, bright and clear. We kept going in what Andy thought was the right direction. We never gave up grinding out our signals on the radio. Then time just stopped for us. For day after day, we just sat there staying alive and being thankful to the headquarters Joe who invented those little boxes of edibles known as emergency rations. It was Benny who first saw the island ahead. - Hey, look, fellas! A mirage! (dramatic music) - [Steve] It was no mirage. We grabbed the paddles and used every ounce of strength we had left. (dramatic music) When we hit the beach, I knew just how Columbus must've felt. It was land. We were alive. It was great to be using our legs once more and we were soon on our way inland. (birds chirping) We would have welcomed the sight of any human being, but if there was anyone on that island, we didn't see them then. (birds chirping) - Ah, home! Just like the bleachers at Ebbets Field. - Son, you don't know what comfort is till you've wrapped your body around a stack of soft, new mown hay. - All right, all right, so sue me. So it's like a slab of concrete. You mad we're living? - When we get home, I'll just introduce you to some of that soft, new mown hay. - There's no place like this chartered on my flight map. Where do you think we landed, Steve? - We landed, that's all that counts. - It might be enemy territory. - It might be. - But, Steve-- - It took us eight days of drifting to get here, Ed. We're lucky to be alive. Now, there's no place else to go. And I'm glad of it. Relax, kid. Worrying's not gonna help it any, but a little sleep will. After all, none of us had any real sleep for over a week. - Ah! - Hey, Benny, why are you sleeping way over there? - I always sleep with my head to the north and my feet to the south. - Why? - Oh, I don't know. I guess it's my magnetic personality. - Well, how do you know with is north and which is south? - By the way I sleep, ya jerk. (tense music) Hey! (tense music) - Don't be a fool. (tense music) - Well, back again. - Back again? - In the guardhouse. - Yeah, with 10 gals outside as guards. - Oh! Fellas, there's a time and a place for everything. There I was, dreaming very nicely about life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. Well, who sent for them dolls? - I don't get it, Steve. Why did you let them bring us here? - Let's play it their way. We got plenty of good hold cards. Did you notice when Ed drew his gun, they didn't even see it? I got a hunch they never saw a gun before in their lives. - Hey, maybe all those broads have is a lotta bounce and no brains, huh? - Stevie, boy, for sure we live in a cockeyed world, but there's nobody in it who hasn't heard of a gun before. - Well, it's my hunch that no one on this island knows there's another world. Everything about them was primitive. Their weapons, clothes. And not a sign of a man anywhere. - You know, you'd think that would be a point in our favor. But we had to get lost on an island where a dame figures a male citizen is only meant to be clubbed into hors d'oeuvres. Ah! - I'd say time forgot all about this place. - But, Steve, them gals are about the most un-ancient looking specimens I ever did see. And they're not natives. - Well, I know anthropologists and archeology is not my racket. But I'd say those girls we saw today don't belong in this age. The island itself, look at the strange rock formation of this cave. Looks like somebody took a lot of hot lead and poured it all over and let it run wild till it cooled and hardened. - I never saw women like those before. Except for pictures in a history book. - They're in the vein as wild as any critter I ever trapped back in Arkansas. Compared to these, they'd eat out of your hand. - Yeah, well the little opportunity I had to see what was happening, I got the impression those names weren't fussy. They'd eat your hand just as soon as eat out of it. (drums beating) - Where do you think we are, Andy? - I don't know, Captain. This little spot's one place they missed on our flight map. And we're way off any shipping lanes. - Fine navigator you are. We drift for eight days in the middle of the ocean, every night you make conversation with the stars, look where it got us. - I had to choose those stars cold, son. Not much you can do without a sextant. And our compass went overboard the second day out. - Ah, not only your compass went overboard, but your non compos mentis fell in, too. - If we ever do get free, it could be the 4th of July for all the good those signal flares in the boat will do us. And if we're that far off course, our little radio hasn't enough range to get us through to anybody anyway. - Those girls will be coming back pretty soon. Our only chance is to make them understand who are, that we're friends, not enemies. - That'll take a heap of convincing. Right now, they're probably lighting a fire under a pot so they can have us for supper. - You know, maybe these dolls have other ideas about us. And if it's what I'm hoping, don't tell me. Let me be surprised. (drums beating nearby) (woman claps) - Thou hath done well to make the strange men captives. They came from the sea as the hairy men once did. Ye were young then and cannot remember, but the hairy men killed our fathers, mothers and brothers and we alone are all that are left of our people. This time we will not be driven from our lands. These men will not escape. They must be killed. - Nay! - Yay! (all speaking) - The ways of men are strange to us, O Sandra, our priestess and protector. But this we know: Without men, our clan will perish. - Ye hath taught us that the wise laws of our ancestors command a fair trial for all. - [Women] Trial! - Those laws shall be upheld. They shall be tried. Bring in the prisoners. (dramatic music) (drum beating) - Here we are, South Sea Island, wild women, dancing girls! You know what? - What? - When we get back, the guys won't believe us. - If we get back. (drum beating) - We sure didn't have nothing like this back home at the farm. (drum beating) (Sandra claps) - Now, if we can only make ourselves understood. - Bring the captives. - Is there such a thing like a mirage, but when you think you're hearing things instead of seeing 'em? I could have sworn that dame spoke English! - [Sandra] Bring the captives here. - There, she said it again! Please, doll. That's being antisocial. - [Sandra] Who are ye? - Ye? How do you like that? With a college education, too. - Hold it, Benny. We're a bomber crew with United States Air Force. - These be words without meaning. From what land come ye? - [Steve] The United States. - United States? Is this the name of a land? - Ask her if she's ever heard of Brooklyn. - He means he's surprised you've never heard of the United States. - Thy tongue is strange. It speaketh much like our own, yet thy words I do not understand. Thou hath said thou art a bomber crew. Means this warriors? - Well, not exactly. We call ourselves soldiers. - Soldiers, warriors, they be the same. They attack, kill, and slave and exile the people. - That's not quite how it goes. Our job's to free the people. Sometimes we have to kill so the world may live in peace. - Then why dost thou come here bearded, like our enemy? - We're not your enemies. We've been drifting all over the ocean for days. We came here by accident. - That salt water ain't much good for shaving, ma'am. - Why hast thou come to our island? - I've been trying to tell you. Our plane got all shot up. We were forced down, had to ditch. - Plain? A plain is a broad open land. - [Steve] An airplane. - A plain in the air? Oh, what foolishness is this? - Look, sweetheart, we fly a bomber. It's called an airplane. We go up and down. Like this. (imitates plane roaring) (women laughing) See? - The man has lost his senses. - I told you we were in trouble. - Thou saith thou can fly like a bird? - In an airplane. - If this be not a trick, then show us. Fly now, the sky is open to you. (women chattering) - Oh, fine. Thanks. - They fly! They fly, but they do not fly. Thy falseness condemns thee and by thy known words, ye be warriors who kill. Take them back to the caves and we shall sit in judgment. And bind their hands. (birds chirping) It is written in the laws of thy ancestors that all who are enemies shall be destroyed. - We must remember, O Sandra, that without men, we shall be the last of our clan. - They have not moved to harm us. - All this is true, O Sandra. - What wouldst thou have us do? - Have them as mates, in marriage. - They be only four and ye are many. How, then, shall they be mated? - By lot. Have a stone for each of us placed in a bowl. All shall be white stones but four, which shall be black. The four who pick the black stones shall mate with the men. (women chattering) - When the others return, we shall decide their fate. - It was real nice while it lasted. - A predicament I am unable to comprehend. Four warm, tenderhearted characters like us and they give us the treatment as if we owed 'em back alimony. - You should have let us use our guns back there, before they jumped us and tied us up. - All right, so they tied us up. Maybe I was wrong. But I can't see myself shooting one of those girls just for tying my hands. - Didn't your mother ever teach you to be kind to women, son? - Say, did any of you guys take a good look at that altar the head dame was standing on? I saw one like it at the Metropolitan Museum. The pagans used to use it. They spread their victims on it and cut their hearts out. - Ah, come off it, buster, you been reading too many comic books. - No, it's true. - The kid's right. That was a sacrificial altar outside. - I ain't no hero and I don't wanna die. But what do you do with a bunch of hens who've all slipped their wigs? Give you that yea, thou, thine double-talk. Sound like a stock company playing one night stands of Shakespeare! - Hold it. There's somebody outside. - Join the others, I'll guard the caves. (dramatic music) - Sorry, Ed, I guess I picked the wrong time to go soft. You were right. - Thy lives will be safe if ye do as I pronounce. - Then why the knife? - It is to cut thy bonds. (knife thuds) Use it, but hasten before the others return. - Sure, use it. Then they put four others in our backs and tell their descendants they knocked off prisoners of war trying to escape. It's an old trick. - That's a chance we'll have to take. We'll have to trust you. - Time becomes thine enemy. We must hasten. - Thanks. - I'll see if the road be clear. - My crack about no guns still goes, except in case of emergency. - What's the matter, Steve? Your heart come out of the deep freeze and start to melt? Couple of minutes ago, you could have killed her. - Yeah, and a couple of minutes ago, I might've killed her. But as long as I rank to command as here I do, I still give the orders. - Yeah, you guys pick a great time to start acting like a couple of umpires calling the play wrong against the Dodgers. - I'm sorry, Steve, I acted like a jerk. - It's all right, kid, forget it. - Here comes Her Highness. - Follow me, quickly. - Let's go. (dramatic music) - Here lies the trail to the bottom of the cliff. Beyond the valley lies your safety. The gods of the sky speed thee. - Wait. - I cannot travel with ye further. - You can tell us who you are. - We are descendants of the Druids. - But the Druids have been a dead race for over 2,000 years. They used to come from England, didn't they? - That is true. But when the Roman invaders ravished our homeland, those of our ancestors who were not slain fled to the far corners of the Earth. So came our forefathers here. - And you? - I am Sandra, priestess of the Sun God. - But the men of your island, what happened to them? - Well, if that don't beat all. - You know, I'm still of the opinion that when they were giving out brains, that then was around the corner somewhere, making a phone call. - I don't know, if it wasn't happening to us I wouldn't believe it. But it is and I still don't know what to think. - I think the whole setup was too simple. - We've no choice, Ed. All right, boys, let's get the landing gear up and take off. (dramatic music) (animals roaring nearby) - Do you see what I do? - Well, what do you know? Right in the middle of nowhere! A circus! Or am I being facetious? - Those things starts chasing you, it won't be any circus. I've seen those things in zoology books, but I never thought I'd see one in this age. - What do you make of 'em, Steve? - Looks like a zoo. About a hundred million years ago. Come on, let's get outta here. (animals grunting) (dramatic music) (tense music) - Hold it back! They're coming after us! (mammoth roaring) (guns firing) (mammoth roaring) (suspenseful music) Let's go! (suspenseful music) Let's get outta here. Come on! (suspenseful music) - Scared? - Scared? If those tusks had been any closer, I'd have been skewered. (Steve laughs) - Our friend, the High Priestess. "May the gods of the sky speed thee." Oh, they sped us right into a prehistoric world. - If we gotta play tag with anymore of these things, I'm for heading back to them gals with the spears. At least with them we got a fighting chance. - Our only chance is to keep on the move, try to stay alive until we can find a way outta here. If we go back there, we're liable to end up with a spear in our back. - Baby, the vacation is over. I think you're gonna have to work no matter which direction we go. (dramatic music) (creature growling) - Hold it, Andy. Let's not look for trouble. He doesn't see us. - Right. - Might as well be throwing spitballs at those schmoes for all the good bullets'll do. - Running par for the course. Everywhere prehistoric animals that should've died millions of years ago. And didn't. - Forget it. He's minding his own business, let's mind ours. Come on. (dramatic music) - Oh! (creature growling) (dramatic music) - Okay, let's take 10. - Ah! - Boys, I been holding out on you. - (laughs) Well! - Thought I'd save it for an emergency. - Ah. - Maybe a smoke'll help us forget what a big juicy steak tastes like. - Yeah! With French fries! - And mushrooms on it. - And a big ice cold beef steak tomato. - And cucumbers. - Right now I could make a meal out of just cucumbers. - Is food the only thing you guys can think of at a time like this? - Well, you know what that Frenchman said about the seven pleasures of life, don't you? - Rabelais. - Yeah, that was him. Well, eating was one of 'em. And you know, too bad those dames weren't a little tamer. I forget what number in the category they came under. - You always look like you're a long way from home, kid. - Well, aren't we? - Oh, I don't mean here, now. You got that I wanna run, but I'm scared to look written all over you. Even when you were assigned to our crew as a replacement, I could see it. You enlist? - Yeah. - A dame? - Yeah. My mother. - So a lot of guys try running away from a lot of things. Parents can be a problem, too. - You ever live your life with someone always telling you how to live it? Well, you're lucky. That was my mother. "Be careful, Ed, you'll catch cold." "Go to sleep early, Ed, you need your sleep." "Don't read too late tonight, Ed. "It's bad for your eyes. "That girl's not good enough for you, Ed. "That girl's selfish." - Let him go, Andy. Maybe it won't eat him up so much now that he's got his guts untwisted. Just took him a little longer to grow up, that's all. Means it'll take him a little longer to work things out. (dramatic music) - We ever get back, Captain, you oughta buy yourself a couch and rent an office on Park Avenue. You could make yourself a lot of that green stuff, crystal balling the brains of the sturgeon and caviar crowd. (dramatic music) (suspenseful music) - Hey, Steve! Steve, help! (suspenseful music) Steve, help! Steve, Steve! Help! - Get him out! It's a flesh-eating plant! (suspenseful music) - I had a neat looking dish try that on me once. First time out with her, too. Cracked three of my ribs and almost broke my arm. So I made the first pass, but did I know she was a female wrestler? - You all right, kid? - He's okay. Just had the wind knocked out of him. - We've got to find our way outta here. We can't fight the unknown. At least we know what the odds are back there. And this time, if our goddess friend gives us any trouble, we'll use our guns. - You know, this snake pit could get to grow on you. In about 40 or 50 million years. (dramatic music) - Hold it! Easy does it, boys. (animals screeching) (dramatic music) (creature growling nearby) (thrilling music) - Shoo! (stammering) Nice animal! Be good! Go away, play with mama, papa! Goodbye! (thrilling music) Steve, Andy! Help me! Go away, animal, leave me alone! Help! Ooh! Hey! Steve, Andy, help! (creature growling) (guns firing) (creature growling) - Come on, let's get outta here! (suspenseful music) - Follow me, up this way. (creature growling) (thrilling music) - Aim for his eyes. (guns firing) (thrilling music) (guns firing) (thrilling music) (dramatic music) (woman laughing) - Oh, no! Please! Hey Steve, look what found us! Oh, keep making with that ointment routine, Cleo, baby. My body's still aching and racked with pain. - Drink this. Thy lips are parched and dry. 'Tis only water. 'Twill not harm thee. (birds chirping) - Thanks. How'd we get here? - We heard the sound of thunder atop the cliffs and saw thee below, in battle with the monster. - Thunder? Thunder? Oh, you mean these. - We rolled great stones down from the cliffs and slew the monster. But I thought ye were also slain. - Steve. We got them to show us where they stashed the boat. Everything was still in it. Rations, candy bars, soap, and a razor. And brother, will I feel about 10 years younger when I shave off this fur piece. - I tell you, this kid Cleo could work at the saltwater baths anytime. Baby, where'd you learn to give rubdowns like that? - This strange tongued one speaketh in riddles. - Riddles or not, honey, you're just my cup of tea. Hey, Steve, how about splitting up the stuff, huh? There's a pool back there. We can take a bath, shave, and then crack open a few cans of rations and throw the girls a little party, USA style. - I will bathe thee. - And I will bring thee food. - And I will soothe thy wounds. - And I will-- - I'm willing, whatever you say, my sweet. - All right, you gooney birds, knock it off. You're big boys now. - It ever occur to you guys that this whole setup may be a frame? - They could've left us in that jam we were in, son. - Well... I'm still not convinced. - Wouldst not have us as thy friends? We do not wish harm brought to thee. - Well, that's cheerful news. How about selling the idea to that High Priestess? - Ye should not have tried to escape from the cave. It was certain death to enter the Valley of the Monsters. - Escape? Baby doll, we didn't try to escape. - Sandra told us what you did. - And what did she tell you? - That ye broke thy bonds and overcame her. But Sandra has forgiven thee and our council has ruled ye friends. - Well, now that's downright decent of them. - Sandra! - Sandra! - The strangers are well? - Yea. - Yea. - It seemeth ye have found them friends indeed. - Yes, we know them as true friends. - Then must I hold speech with them. - Yeah, and we would hold speech with you, too. - Thou art brave warriors. - Brave warriors, fine. Why the double-cross? - The meaning of thy speech puzzles me. - Why the fix? The frame, the phony steer? - Why did you deliberately lead us into the valley where you knew we'd be killed? - I was wrong. I ask thee to forgive me. This isle has been sacred to the Druids since they fled here for shelter. Through the years, we have fought and died to keep it so. In the past, many have been cast upon our shores, as thee, and were put to death. - [Steve] Why? - We do not know who comes masked as hairy men. Four summers ago, they came from the sea. They burned our village, killed our fathers and brothers, and carried our sisters away as captives. We were far off in the temple, high in the mountains. As High Priestess, I was schooling the young among our daughters in the wisdom of our ancestors so they would be prepared for the vows of marriage. Now we are the last of our tribe. We have not but caves for a home. - So you thought when we were washed up on the shore that we were these hairy men. - You know, ma'am, that's exactly what we were out doing when we got shot down, fighting a bunch of guys like your hairy men characters. 'Course, we were flying a little too high to tell whether they had toupees on their faces or not. - Hey Buster, let's not go through that flying like a bird routine with her again. - Thou art ruled as friends, free to roam as thy please. The caves in which you were held prisoner shall be thy home. One thing. Thy word. Ye shall not hold speech with my sisters. - We understand. (birds chirping) - Some bet she wants to give us. Just when that Cleo and me were getting to understand each other! - You know, that Sandra gal has just about as pretty a fuselage as any four-motor job I ever did see. - Yeah, well, don't get caught in the backwash of her props, chum. It'll blow you sky-high. Besides, I thought you were getting along real good with that Tennus doll. - Ed, is there any way of souping up that radio? - Well, I can work on it. Why? - Oh, just a crazy idea. May be some islands around here. May be inhabited. Might give it a try. - Yeah, maybe they'll send a landing party over and pick us up as prisoners of war and we'll spend the rest of our days in some concentration camp eating rice and raw fish. - Well, that's a chance we gotta take. Meantime, stay away from those girls. Now, come on, let's clean up and get organized. - (sighs) How Steve can let such talent go to waste, I'll never know. - Guess we'll just have to eat these candy bars ourselves. (gentle music) - Any luck? - I don't know. - Oh, what good are they? It's like being in a phone booth without a nickel. I think when you ditch, the Air Force never wants to hear from you again. That's why they give you those things. Well! (gentle music) (women laughing) Hey, what happened? You dolls get a pass to go off limits? - We wish to see thee. - But Sandra, what'll she say? - Oh, we will return before she discovers we're missing. It's her hour of prayer. - As far as we're concerned, doll puss, you're in friendly territory. Come on. I'll give you candy bar and tell you all about the Brooklyn Dodgers. (gentle music) - Dost not my presence please thee? - You shouldn't have come here. - But I would see thee again, Ed. (radio transmitter whirring) It is a strange bird that sings like that. - It's a radio transmitter. Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot. Our worlds are centuries apart. - But why dost thou make it sing? - I'm trying to send words through the air, to let others know where we are. - I do not understand. We be friends, yet we be not. Ye wish to go away? - Well, it's funny, now that you mention it, I don't know. I don't know what I have to go back to. If we get picked up, I'll get back into action. Maybe next time I will have had it. - Thy speech confuseth me. - You know something? Sometimes it confuseth me, too. - Go on, take a bite. It'll give you strength, energy! Lots of muscles! What am I saying? - Mm! 'Tis sweeter than all honey. - You not only overwhelm my Supply Sergeant with joy, but you fill my heart with cheer, too. Eat, enjoy yourself. - Thou art truly my friend. - Sweetheart, I'm one of the friendliest citizens that ever set foot on this island of paradise. And when you're finished with your dessert, I think I should explain to you exactly what Webster had in mind when he put the word friendship in the dictionary. (woman laughs) (gentle music) - 'Course, alongside the food we had back home at the farm, this GI stuff is just poison. - Poison? - Oh, just a word honey, just a word. We ain't had too many casualties from the stuff. You look like you got a good, strong constitution. Honey, you ever milk a cow? - Milk a cow? - Sure. Look. Now, take all my fingers here. That's right. Now, pull on 'em real gentle like. That's the way. It's right simple, see? - No. - Oh, it ain't for real, honey, I was just giving you the general idea. You catch on real fast. You'd love it back in Arkansas. - Arkansas? - Yeah, Arkansas. Probably getting ready for the fall planting around now, while the ground is soft and the sun is warm. - Speaketh more of this Arkansas. - We only have about 30 acres, but that's like a whole world. You're good to the land, it's good to you. 'Course, you never know when you'll get a hot summer and she'll burn up on you. And sometimes frost'll freeze the crops in the ground before they ever get born. But you start in all over again because that little piece of ground is your whole life. It's where you were born and where you'll probably die. (tense music) (gentle music) - [Steve] Myra. - Didst frighten thee? - Does Sandra know you're here? (chuckles) Then why'd you come? You know we gave her our word. (gentle music) - Thou art nice. - Oh look, honey, we've had enough trouble. I'm just a human guy. Now, let's don't have any more. (gentle music) Here, take it. It's yours, now go. (gentle music) (Steve laughs) It won't hurt you, but your hanging around here will. (gentle music) - Ye hath broken thy word. Ye told me ye were men of honor and I had trusted ye! - It was we who went against thy word. - No, we're the ones. It wasn't their fault. (tense music) (hairy men shout) (women screaming) - Sandra! Sandra! The hairy men! The hairy men are coming and are killing our sisters! - Your spears, girls! - Wait! We have weapons. Come on, boys, let's go! (thrilling music) (women screaming) (guns firing) (dramatic music) They're gone. - Thy magic thunder has driven them away. Now that ye are here, we need no longer fear the hairy men. - Well, that's real great, but it's not very good generalship. Now, why don't you take those kids up to the temple just in case? All right, we gotta get out of here. Girls, go with Sandra up to the temple. Benny, Ed, Andy, head for the caves and cover them. Hurry! (Steve sighs) - The last one. Now, if I was back home with all that corn silk... 'Course, I'm not back home. We save it or pass it around now? - Now or later, what's the difference? - Oh, boy, it's so quiet out there you can hear the birds think. - Well, it won't be for long. Those jokers will be coming back. Ed, stand guard. Shoot anything with hair on it that moves. You guys know we're only good as long as our ammunition holds out, don't you? - I hope those dolls made the temple okay. - A couple of bright sayings to their sun gods might help. - What are you doing here? You're supposed to be with the girls. - My sisters are safe. - All right, they're safe! You don't have to get yourself killed telling us. - The hairy men have fled. Thy thunder drove them from our land. - Are you crazy? They may be out of this world, but they're smart enough to know that there's only four of us against a lot of them. How long do you think we can hold out? - I do not understand. - He means we go bang, bang a few times and then-- - But thy thunder. - The rainstorm is just about over, sweetheart. - Now, you get back up to that temple where you'll be safe. - I came to give thee this. It is a symbol of tribe leadership. Such powers belong to the brave, the strong. It is no longer wise for a woman to rule the tribe. - Sandra, there isn't much time. In a little while none of us may be left to rule anything except a grave. As long as they don't know where the temple is, you and the girls are safe. But if they ever get their hands on you, you're through. Can't you see you've got to go now? If we pull outta this, we'll meet you there. - We shall await thee. - Want to know something? I changed my mind about that dish. There's a dame that's a real lady. (tense music) (Sandra screams) - Come on! (tense music) Hurry, find the girls! (dramatic music) - I go to join my ancestors now. They are waiting for me in the land of thy gods. Remove the emblem from around my neck. The symbol of tribe leadership. It shall be thine. (dramatic music) (volcano rumbling) (dramatic music) (gun fires) (thrilling music) (gun fires) (thrilling music) (gun fires) (thrilling music) (gun fires) - Behind you, Ed! (gun fires) (thrilling music) (guns firing) (thrilling music) (guns firing) (thrilling music) - You all right? - Yeah, I guess so. That was mighty close. - Where's Ed? How did it happen? - In the back. With a spear. - Same as Sandra. How much ammunition you guys got left? - Ah, I'm just about out. Why? - Forget it. Go down to the beach, get in the rubber boat and shove off. You'll make it. - Let me ask you why, Steve? - I owe Sandra and the girls something. She gave me this when she died. - Ah, I've had enough of those boats. I'll stick with you and those dolls. - Well, somebody has got to go along and keep Benny outta trouble with those dolls. - Okay, let's go. (tense music) (volcano rumbling) (tense music) (hairy men grunting) (Myrna screaming) (hairy men talking in foreign language) - Help me! Help me! (screams) (gun fires) - Get him, Andy! (gun fires) What are you doing here? - I came searching for thee to lead thee to the temple. My sisters pray to their gods. (volcano rumbling) And the gods have answered! But where is Sandra? - Dead. Now, you'd better lead us to that temple. (tense music) - Come, I will take you to the Great Mountain. (tense music) (volcano blasts) My sisters! My sisters! (cries) (stones rumbling) - We'll get through here. Let's go. - Where to? - Down at the beach, the rubber raft. Come on. (tense music) (volcano blasting) (stones crashing) (thrilling music) - I'll go get her! (thrilling music) - Andy! (volcano blasting) (thrilling music) (volcano blasting) (stones crashing) (volcano rumbling) (stones crashing) (volcano rumbling) (creatures growling) (volcano rumbling) (creature roaring) (volcano rumbling) (waves lapping) (plane roaring) Myra. Sandra. - He'll be all right. Well, Professor, what do you think? - I don't know. - There wasn't a trace of the island left when the plane sighted him. Yet a Naval vessel a thousand miles from the area reported that its instruments had recorded several violent explosions right in the vicinity where Steve was finally picked up. - The sea hides many worlds beneath its surface. Some of them are still actively volcanic. - Then, er, how do you account for this, Professor? It was found clenched in Steve's hand when they took him off the boat. - That's amazing. Priceless! An alloy that hasn't been used by man since... Not since the days of the Druids. (dramatic music)
