What are you doing? Hurry up! - I'm limping as fast as I can! - Why? What happened? I slipped last night while puking. - But the sea was so calm. - Sure, I'm the one who rocked the boat. So, you've decided to piss me off? Not for much longer, I'm stopping here. What a drama queen. I said I can't walk! It's not my fault, I'm sure it's getting infected. You're giving me the "infected" routine, tough guy? You want to see my ankle, Doctor? Fine, let's check it out. You're such a... I'm getting seasick out here too. There's nothing wrong, it's not even swollen! Maybe it's swollen inside, you can't see it. You just want to be right. It's rotten, you're screwed now. - Happy? - Why do you say that? You're so mean, you know that freaks me out. Come on, I'll find you a nice place to die in. Asshole! I'm not moving until you get Gérard on the phone. Why bother calling from here? We're broke! If he's not waiting in Paris, I'm not going. We can show up whenever we want, it's no problem. Well, I don't trust Gérard. Why go back to Paris, anyway? We had work in Athens. Yeah, which was your favorite? Cleaning out toilets or playing music dressed as shepherds? - We made ends meet. - Denis, we can do better than that. I'm a musician, and we have to eat. I won't argue. I'm staying here until you've called Gérard. Fine. Watch our stuff and be careful, got it? Duh, of course! Yeah. François! If you see a pharmacy, get me some anti-inflammatory! Yeah, if I see a morgue, I'll send you a friendly team, I promise! This sucks, damn it. I bet you didn't find him. You bet I did. Did you talk to him? Did you have any coins? Yes, we did talk a bit. What'd he say? That he's waiting for us. What else could he say? You're acting weird, I don't like it. I'm just tired. Let's go. You're tired, but weird. I'm sure Gérard said something. If he did, I'd tell you. What do you take me for? We've got a long trip ahead, pal, enough already. We won't finish a single movie, obviously Having a shared, sliced life Soothed by the whirring air-con Sleeping in a shabby hotel Hanging out in gay spots, seeing their bodies entwine Seeing their hearts bleed out Yes, bleed out I'll go there one day I'm a cat one day, a rat another See if the heart of the city beats within you You'll take me with you Take me there One day, I'll have New York at the tips of my fingers We'll play there, you'll see The clubs are dark, but they're not cold They're not cold, if you believe it And I do believe it! The paint puddles on the wall sometimes are The color of the sounds you're drinking And, it's so big that we'll soon forget That nowhere is my home Not yours or ours One day, I'll go there I'm a cat one day, a rat another See if the heart of the city beats within you And you'll take me with you, Take me there Touching this, and touching that See if the heart of the city beats within me And you'll take me with you Take me there Can't he close the window? - He's car sick. - Yeah, but it's raining. - It's best he gets some air. - You guys are crazy! Rain's pouring into my car, you know? That doesn't matter, he's sick! Get out! You wanted air? You're better off outside. But we're almost there. Exactly, it's not far. Enough already, get out! Don't freak out over a few raindrops! Unbelievable! The seat's a real bathtub now! Do you think I'm stupid? A bathtub? Let's get out, this is bullshit. What did you say? I wasn't talking to you, jerk! This jerk's gonna smack you! - Stop, let's go. - Just a sec! Touch me and I'll bash your head on the dashboard! Just drop it. Scram before I get angry! Why were you so aggressive? He wasn't wrong, you know? What do you mean, "he wasn't wrong?" You're pissing me off, always getting sick. He was driving so fast and you were smoking. You always have an excuse. "He was smoking." This is unbelievable, now it's all my fault. It's not mine! He could have dropped us off, now we have to walk in the rain. You're the reason we're on this trip, anyway. I didn't force you to follow me, pal. Right, I see. Don't worry, I'll stop bothering you now. Live your life, I'll live mine. That's best for everyone. So long, and sorry for being too sick for you. I can handle things on my own. Go get yourself a new friend in a gym! Well, are you done? Come on, you'll catch your death. Be grateful. Number 41, this is it. Check out this doorbell. What do you want? - Hello, sir. We're looking for Gérard. - There's no Gérard here, go away. What was that? I don't know. This is 41, he's just confused. Attack, Panzer! Let's get out of here. We're Gérard's friends, we just want to see him! He doesn't live here. We moved in six months ago, the place was a dump. Leave us alone! It wasn't just a dump, it was disgusting! People like him should get their heads examined! Shut up! Denis! If I hadn't lied, you'd still be in Marseille. If you were easygoing, I wouldn't have to do this to you. You couldn't stand the heat! You even got heatstroke in a nightclub! You're better here, aren't you? Aren't you? I don't know why you're sulking. We have another address for Gérard, we'll find him tomorrow, it's fine. That's it, you won't talk to me? You're a real pain, you know? Can I just ask you two questions? One: how will we eat? Two: where are we sleeping? - At the hotel, period. - With 40 bucks, period? There are plenty of great hotels in Paris for 40 bucks. I've told you, I don't want any games here, got it? If he's a cop, we're screwed. It's obvious he's just a poor bastard. - No, he's not. - I've checked all the other hotels. This is the last time. When you're done, take your ass home. Always so helpful. I'm not Mother Teresa! - Pay him, honey. - How much? That much. Well, do you want the room or not? Yeah. Show me the money, you gotta pay up front. Breakfast is eight bucks a day, up front. We'll pass on breakfast. Second floor, room seven. First, it's hookers, now, it's queers. Denis! Come on, we're tired. Let's go. What are you doing? I'm shaving. Nice mirror, I can't see a thing. I'll end up mutilating my mustache. Third door on the right, there's a shower and mirror. You like to live dangerously, I don't. I survived Greek meat, but I'm not immortal. Why did you wash your hair? We're not going anywhere. I am. I called a girl I know, she's a bit depressed. If you don't mind, I'd like to see her, it might help her. She's a model. Right, more model than depressed. - Does it bother you? - No. Given the bed's size, it actually works out. What will you do? I don't know, just roam around. This room isn't bad. Yeah... It makes you want to go out. Come on, I'm bored. SOLDAT LABOUREUR PEARS What are you doing? Going to see how it smells outside. Mr Louis! I have something to tell you, but I don't dare. But I'd rather be honest with you. I'm hungry. Got anything to eat? You haven't had dinner? I have, but English airplanes have terrible food. You live in London? No. I worked there for six months on an album with a British band. Did you compose anything? Yeah. Well, I mostly made arrangements. That's great. Which hotel are you staying at? I'm not at a hotel. I'm staying at my friends' place. They picked me up from the airport. I'm super happy to see you again. I'll finish this later. You won't keep playing? No, it's getting late. I'm getting some earthly vibes. You play really well. - If I had money, I'd give you some. - Thanks. - Do you like Irish music? - I love it, it's my favorite. Have another beer! No thanks, I'm not done sucking on my shirt yet! Did you know this kind of pub existed in Paris? No! I didn't think it existed anywhere! - You're not singing. - I am, in my head. A lot! What? You have to go, my fiance's arriving. He works in a nightclub and they close at four o'clock. Hurry up. What are you talking about? Did you know he'd be coming? Yeah, why? Right, well... I hope I didn't get anything dirty. - All good? - Yes. - Alright, see ya. - See ya. - Wait, move over a bit. - Okay. - Watch out, my arm! - Sorry. It's okay. Shit, I'm sorry. Well, I didn't think you would... - Move over, hon. - I didn't stay with her. That's annoying. Yeah, sorry. I really am. François, this is Katrina, she plays the flute. Hello. This is a problem, I don't know where to sleep. Yeah, this is pretty annoying. What about your place? Where I'm staying, it's not possible. There must be a solution. Yes, I think the solution is... I leave. But we didn't have time to do anything! Maybe next time. We'll meet again if our karma lets us. Yeah, if it's up to karma, it's fine. Goodbye, my little elf. Johnny, whoops! Johnny, Johnny... You'll never grow up. Apart from having a screw loose, what's she like to screw? Very classy... I didn't have time to find out. Damn you. For once, I didn't have to make any threats. - You hate me? - No, I'm just upset. Why didn't you stay? She kicked me out. Before or after? - After. - Some are always lucky. Maybe she's not wrong. Apart from her ass, I'm not interested. Don't complain, that's already pretty good. Sometimes, I wonder... So, what happened? - It'll just bore you. - No, go on. I'm annoyed now anyway, can't sleep. That's weird, it's a bar. Looks like a fake address. Stop being so negative all the time. We're looking for a musician friend and end up at a bar. He can have friends at this bar, it's not against the law. Excuse me, sir. - Sir, please. - I'm busy. Could you answer when I talk to you? Let me go! What do you want? I'm looking for Gérard, he gave me this address. I don't know anything. People come and go here. - Go see Mr Christian. - Where is he? Not in my pocket. He'll be here tomorrow night. See? We'll find him, don't worry. Sure, we can eat tomorrow evening! - Go on, they're about to go in. - It's not crowded enough. I'm not sure more people are coming. We'll see. At least Athens was dry. Here, we're drowning. Go on, people are going inside. - Wait, where's the cup? - Come on, Denis! - You've got to be kidding! - Maybe you have it. I never had it, it's in your stuff. - Keep looking! - It's not here. You took it. Seriously? Great, just look my guitar! Just look at this! - Look! - You're getting my medicine wet! Okay, I found it. Next time, hold it in your hand. There's someone there, look. - There's no point. - Why not? Because she's hot, leave her alone. Exactly! She's probably rich too. Denis! - Hello. - Hi. Sorry, I won't lie, we need money for food. - If you don't mind... - Yes, of course. - No! Keep your money! - Why? Take some. No, I played badly, it's raining, this sucks. No, it was nice, I assure you. You guys are funny. Do you have the time? Sorry, we have nothing. Alright... Well, I guess I've been stood up. - See you. - Bye. Are you nuts? You're saying we can only hit on ugly ones? It's not that, you just have to work faster. We've got five bucks for a hotel and food. We're screwed. We don't have to pay for food. - Did you see the price? - We're not paying, so relax. Exactly! That's daylight robbery. Just listen to this guy... So, to be good guys, we have to eat dog food? - You're hardcore. - Sure, joke around, it's free. Stay with the cart, I'll get the ham. Wait, I'm coming too! You're likely to pick Parma ham! A bag? Hey, look, diapers. What about the hotel? The owner knows us now, it's fine. Wait, I'm not going back right away. Can you take my guitar? You're not coming to eat with me? I'm not hungry, I'll go for a walk. Take it to the hotel, be a pal. You could have said so! We'd have grabbed just one piece of ham. What a waste. - At what time does the movie end? - In 20 minutes. Thanks, sir. Waiting for your friend? Well? Didn't you watch the end of the movie? No, it sucks. Anyway, I was hungry. Is your friend waiting for you? No. - Have you two been begging for long? - Yeah. It's our first time in front of a cinema. We should plan better. Yes, I noticed. What's your name? Mathilde. Sir? Could I have my key, please? Sure. Could I have my 40 francs, please? My friend will pay when he comes in. Then, your friend will get the key. Wait for him here. - Are you kidding? - Do I look like it? No. What do you do, other than beg? I just finished an album with a British band. Really? No, that's not true. My pal and I were in Athens. We went to Ibiza in summer, Provence to pick olives... We followed the hot weather, see? But now, we'll get real jobs. Damn it. - Problem? - It's Frédéric. My date. I must have gotten the screening time wrong. I gotta go. Too bad. Yeah, it's a shame. See you. See you. We can go have dessert together. He wants to watch the movie. He has no idea. - Alright. Want to share? - Sure. Damn it, I ruined it. Would you rather have the dough or the apple filling? I'll just have that bit. Your clothes are soaked. Aren't you cold? No. I'm used to it. Thirty seconds. Your friend still isn't here. I'm giving your room away. - You can't do that! - Room seven. No way! Our stuff's in there! They won't touch your stuff. Will you cut it out with that ham? This isn't the Salvation Army! Sorry, I'm out of coffee. I've only got tea left. That's fine, better than nothing. - Is it drying? - Slowly. - Sugar? - Does it taste better with sugar? Not really. Are these yours? Yes, they're my dance shoes since I started ballet. When I get depressed, I count them. It's stupid, I know... I don't think it is. What gets me depressed is having nothing to count. Put the robe on, your t-shirt's wet too. - Want me to turn around? - Yes, please. Too small? No, it's good, nicely fitted. - Stupid teapot. - Wait, I'll do it. How are you holding it? It's so hot. I do it like everyone else, I burn myself. That hurt, didn't it? - No, I'm fine. - It's all red. - I'm fine. - I'll go get something... No, I'm fine. What are you doing here? I'm sleeping. - What time is it? - Why are you sleeping here? I have no money and he wouldn't give me the key. What the hell? He wouldn't even let me sleep on the bench. My whole body hurts, it's like I was interrogated by the Gestapo. Did you sleep okay? Well, yeah. That was harsh! Couldn't you give credit? - Yeah, but I didn't. - The key, please. I'm here to do my job, not to save some bums. If you're unhappy, I couldn't care less. - Why not let him sleep on the bench? - It's fine. What do you take me for? You think I like seeing this wreck camp in the lobby? Is this a Hilton? We're not fancy enough for this shithole? Right, this conversation's over. Take your trash and get out. - Let's go. - You jerk! You rented out my room while I was working again. What the hell do you care? - Give me my money back. - Where do you think you are? I do what I want. Don't like it? Climb back up your tree! A monkey trying to fuck me over... - Take that back! - You'll see what I'll take back! Are you crazy? You're insane! Stop, it's none of our business. Get out or I'll shove a bullet up your ass! Are you sure we won't annoy your cousins? No, it's no problem, we have plenty of space. But we don't know them, we might not get along. Everyone gets along with my cousins. - I'll sit in front, or I'll get sick. - Yes, please. Looks like the seat belt's stuck. You won't need one with me. Do you know you're in the death seat? Go! - Is the music bothering you? - That's not the issue. If it's not on full blast, I fall asleep. It's fine, leave it on. I'm getting off! Let's get out of here. Where to? Come on. Denis, you okay? Need some help? Fuck off, I can do it alone! Shit! Hello. Are you squatting here? My cousins make food for these people. Hello. Come on in, it's this way. If you want, I'll get you some tomorrow night. Sit down, I'll go find my cousin. What's it like to see ET in real life? You asshole. Come on, man. Hi. No! They were nice to me. Can you help them? We will help them, Joseph, we will. I'm going to sleep now. Sure, Joseph, go and sleep a bit. - No thanks, I only drink decaf. - You'll drink this hot coffee! Or we won't see you behind your mustache, little man. You'll be fine here, you're already part of the family. Is this it? No, the ceiling fell, this is a passageway. - Passageway to what? - The other side. We had to do this because the staircase collapsed. - I see. - There's no way I'm going on that. Come on! I can't, I'm afraid of heights. You've got to be kidding! Okay, hold on to my belt, close your eyes. Let's go. - No! - Come on! See? It's fine. How will I go shopping on my own? - They'll sleep above your room. - Hello. What's wrong? Is the poor guy blind? No, the poor guy's a chicken. There, this is it. There's light, that's good. Yeah, we connected to a bus shelter in the street. As for water, go to the courtyard. What's this? Those here before you would steal from shops. They were arrested. - Bye. - Thanks. Don't give me that look, we're not going to stay here. We'll go see the bar guy about Gérard, and this will all be over. Why can't you just admit it? Gérard totally screwed you over! He doesn't give a shit about us. So, stop pretending to believe him! What do you mean? I do believe him, and so do you! I'm a good musician. If not, you wouldn't be helping me. Yes or no? For now, do what I'm doing. Just relax and trust me. Are you crazy? I'm not lying on that thing and catching malaria. We better find a way to get money quick. - Let's talk about this later. - No, let's talk about it now! I'm hungry, but I won't steal anymore. It's too early to go beg at the cinema. Not the cinema, we'll go beg in the subway. At least we'll be dry. Come on. You're a real pain in the ass. We stand here and wait for people, it's perfect. Yeah, perfect. Denis, you fell asleep. Shit. Just tell them we were here first. Forget it, let's go. There's no point. Are you nuts? Let's find another spot, since we're here now. Come on. What's your problem? Are you crazy? This is my spot, you know. Well, we were here first, you know. This is still my spot. You must be new. You can't just play anywhere. And why not? There are rules. If you don't know them, you'll learn. Are you threatening me? Fine, we'll look for another spot. I'm not threatening you, I don't care. I'm just trying to help you. Stay here if you want. Keep your spot, and drop dead. It sucks here, anyway. - Come on, let's go. - I know a great spot. Sure, we can go that way too. - I give up, my fingers are frozen. - Stop exaggerating! In ten minutes, I'll have to amputate! Wait, the fan stopped. I'm sure this is a good spot. Maybe for storing frozen meat, but not for begging. Fine, let's go to Gérard's bar, then. - Can't you go without me? - See? You don't believe him. That's not it. I have something important to do. - The model? - No, not the model. - You won't tell me. - That's right. - Excuse me, sir? - Yeah? My friend and I came by, we're Gérard's friends. You said-- Oh, yeah. Go see Mr Christian in the cellar. - The cellar? - You know, the bathroom. The 'cellar' is under the stairs. Half a pint! No, you're not in the wrong bathroom. I'm the one who messed-up. That's okay. Tonight, it's Mrs Ugly. This old hag sure isn't a turn-on. Sure, she is. Well, to each his own. - You're here to get laid again? - Handsome Christian. Don't leave your shit here, I don't want to get in trouble because of you. Hey, beat it! What do you want? Nothing. I came here on a whim, but I'm no longer in the mood. - Go on. - Sorry, Christian. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight! Come down, two, three... Five, six, seven, eight... And one! Three, four... Six, seven... One, two, three, four... Instead of taking classes, you should teach. You're really good. When you're a dancer, you have to take classes your whole life. I can't talk for long. I've only got five minutes to get changed. Too bad. I gotta go. Come with me, if you want. Since you're busy right now, we could meet up tonight. No, tonight's not possible. Just a sec. You look so pretty. Are you seeing a guy tonight? No. Mathilde, it's very simple. If you don't want to see me anymore, just say so. I'm just sad. It's even simpler than that. I'm going to New York for a year to work with an American teacher. It's not the best time to start a relationship. Excuse me. It would be a shame. I really have to go now. Go ahead. If I were staying, things would be different. Sure, but you're leaving. That's life. Yeah, as always. Mathilde! - Who's there? - What's going on? Am I bothering you? On the contrary, we missed you. Hi, how are you? Sorry. - Do you have five minutes? - Not really. Why? What's wrong? Nothing, just the usual. I got dumped again. I won't bore you with my shit. I'll just go to bed. Wait, I'm coming. It's not much, but it does help. Hold on. Denis? What? Do you have anything for a stomach ache? Why? What's the matter? I had a bottle of kirsch, now my stomach's burning. You're such a pain! I'll go see what I've got. Denis, I think I'll go to bed. It'll just take five minutes. No, I'm exhausted. I have to get up early. - Unbelievable. I must be cursed. - Are you leaving because of me? No. Your syrup worked, he's stopped coughing. - Good to hear. - See ya. Here. Don't chew it, let it melt. Sorry, I didn't mean to ruin your night. Well, you did anyway. So, want to talk about it? What's the story this time? Remember the cinema chick? You don't wait around, do you? Sometimes, I really hate you. François? Wake up, we're going to be late. Get up, I made you some cocoa. Can't you take that off? You're scaring me. I was cold last night. Don't want an ear infection. I saw a guy who had a myringotomy, he was clawing at his mom's hands. What the hell is this? Cocoa and water. They're out of milk. - It's horrible. - But it's warm. - What time is it? - It's already 4:20. "Already?" What do you have to do at 4:20 a.m.? The subway's open. That way, we'll get the best spot. You wake me up for that? You're out of your mind! I'm not going to the subway anymore. - What do we do, then? - Play music. Did you go to Gérard's bar? What? I did, but that Mr Christian guy wasn't there. - He'll be there today. - No, he won't! You're crazy, don't go! That cellar is needle heaven! Why do you want to see Gérard? He told us that if we came to Paris, he'd find us jobs. Really? You can stop looking for him. He was forced to leave France. - For his work? - You could put it that way. Why? Did he get into trouble? It doesn't say "Information" on my forehead, you know? Thanks anyway. But if you're looking for a job... I might have something. Depends. What is it? Nothing too bad. Just transporting stuff... for people who can't travel as easily as you can. I'll have to see. Come and see, then. And eight, and two, three, four, five, six, eight, and up! Two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, and down. Two, three, four, bend. Two, four, hold position. Why'd you come back? I'll come by until you forbid me. I'm leaving in two days. Mathilde, that's in the future... The present is important too. You drive me up the wall. Just leave. See? You just had to say it. Now, it's clear. See ya. And one, two, three, four, and repeat. François! I don't want to stop seeing you. What would you like? Just a slice of pâté, please. - Very little. It's for a baby. - This much? No, half. You just want it to roll a cigarette! - That's 7.80. - Excuse me? - It's 7.80. - For that? You can keep it! Bunch of thieves! Denis! What's going on? What the hell's this? Work. What kind of work? Transporting six suitcases full of clothes. Seems dodgy to me. Who hooked you up with this? Mr Christian, the guy from the bar. Are you insane? Can't you tell he's a gangster? You said you didn't see him yesterday. - Well... just briefly. - "Briefly", sure. Anyway, nothing proves this is illegal. Can you explain why you're tearing off the labels, then? I don't know, pal. Maybe the guy sells cut-labels. Sure, that's probably it. What have you gotten us into? Did he mention Gérard? - Gérard's not in Paris anymore. - See? I was right! Yeah, you were right and I was wrong. - Let's finish this work now. - I'm not falling for it. - Care to tell me what your plan is? - Sure. I'll borrow your guitar and beg on my own. Right. You only know three chords, you poor thing. That's all I need. - Be careful with my guitar. - What do you take me for? Walk in the shade I'M AN UNEMPLOYED CHEMIST WITH THREE KIDS, HELP ME! I punched a punk That never forgot how to be ugly And an intellectual, - Nouvel- - Obs kind of guy When Bob slaughtered the pinball machine We didn't have a single penny left I thought about it and said to myself It is true that I am as thick As an SNCF sandwich And tomorrow I could stumble upon A guy that'll rip my head off If he finishes me off And I just die right on the bar If Death buys me a drink with a nasty grin Before it carries me up there To see if the bars up there are crowded I'll say to Death You're getting on my nerves You don't belong in my world Get outta here, you're no friend of mine Get out, you stink... Go walk in the shade - What's your problem? - Shut up. - I didn't do anything! - Shut up! Be careful! No playing here, it's our spot. Nice guitar. No, please, it's not mine. Now listen, the next time we see you in the subway, we'll be smashing your head, not your guitar. Got it? I forgot to say goodbye. Shit, shit, shit. Come on, not that! I can't get it without a prescription. It's my friend, Mr Mustache! Go sit down, I'll get you some food. - I'm not hungry. - I'll have none of that! Sit down now or I'll hit you with my ladle! - Hi. - Hi. Here, look. What's that, on your face? Nothing, I just tried to open a glass door without my hands. - Aren't you hungry? - Yes. Eat, then! When I stare at this beef stew, I think of the dead animal in it. Have a drink, it'll help. I can't, I'm on antibiotics for my busted lip. - Want a joint? - No, thanks. I don't touch that stuff. Although, at this point... The other day, it was raining. See what it's like when it's dry? I really need to go now. No! Too bad! Can I please walk you to the subway? I don't know... I'll have to think about it. Okay, I thought about it. It's a yes. Could you pass me the joint? Come on, please. What's wrong? Nothing, just this in my pocket. - Jean- - René gave it to me. Careful, you'll get sick if you're not used to it. That's bullshit. The others didn't affect me. With your skills, you can work any time you want. We left for a long time, so I don't have any contacts anymore. We have friends in the business, we can introduce you. That'd be great. We're recording right now. I'll give you the address. Come by and we'll talk. Okay. I'm finishing a job now, I'll come by when I'm done. Works for me. Your friend's not feeling well, he says he's not waterproof anymore. - "Not waterproof?" - I don't know what's wrong. François, is that you? Yes, it's me. Are you okay? I'm really cold. You'll be okay. - Did you close the door? - Yeah, why? I was attacked by some foxes earlier. - That's normal, it's the season. - Really? You can go if you want. He'll be like this for a while. - You sure? - It's hard to talk, my teeth are growing. If you need anything, let me know. Okay, try to go to sleep for a bit. - No, I'm worried it'll start snowing. - If it does, I'll wake you up. - You promise? - Of course. - You're staying with me? - Yes. If the foxes come back, I have some pills in my bag, you can have some. Don't worry, the foxes know me. Keep your pills for next time. Okay. François, are you mad at me? Of course not, little dude. It's okay. Just look at you. Well? Feeling any better? Yeah. I feel weird, but better. What made you want to smoke that thing? I don't know, I was depressed. We gotta find work, I'm not going into the subway again. You're finally coming 'round! I have work, but you don't want it. Transporting stolen coats? Don't count on me. - I'm not getting into organized crime. - I won't mention it again. Fine. It's super crowded now. Exactly! Come on! But we'll get spotted! You could at least wait for me! - It would have been faster by subway. - It's full of cops. Speaking of subways, what did you do with my guitar? Nothing. I just put it away under some stuff. - "Under some stuff?" - At the squatter's place. I need to take a break. - No, we're almost there. - I don't care, I don't want a hernia. Okay, you rested. Can we go now? What? I just sat down! We're being followed. - Are you serious? - Don't turn around. Just go. Go on. I told you! Walk normally, you idiot! Honestly, this guy... - There. - What are you doing? - We've arrived. - Exactly, so don't stop! - Why not? - We're being followed. No one's following us. I said that to make you hurry up. You're a real bastard. I wish I were strong enough to beat you up. Come on, man. I'll go find the guy, okay? Come on. Are you sure we weren't being followed? Come on in, gentlemen. Put that over there. - Hello, ma'am. - Hello, gentlemen. This place is a mess. - Why didn't you do the dishes? - Because I'm down in the dumps. That's a load of crap! You're a disgusting slob. Stop being so mean. You're gonna make me cry again, you asshole! Quit your nonsense. Can't you see I'm working? Fine. I'll go see Kiki. Excuse me, gentlemen, my nerves are shot right now. My dog has an infection on his head. - We understand. - Now, then. - Are these the last suitcases? - Yes, that's all of them. Okay, I'll go get the money. You two look alright, I want to trust you. What do you mean? Mr Christian told you about the watches, right? - What watches? - These. Selling these is a piece of cake! Real Swiss watches. Since you two are nice, I want to help you. What do we have to do? Take these for free, sell them, and you keep part of the cash. No, thanks, we're not interested. The little guy's always talking. What do you think? We work together so we'll have to talk about it. No, thanks. Take your time. I'll go get your money. See what we've gotten ourselves into? Maybe these watches aren't such a bad idea. You're insane. Can't you see this guy's a dealer? Just look at all those car radios. Well? Have you thought about it? For now, we'll still think about the watches. Wait a sec, that's not what was agreed. - What do you mean? - Didn't Christian tell you? The full price was only if you take the watches. If not, it's just half. We never agreed to that! We want our money. - Then, take the watches! - See? Because of your shit. You're going to pay us! Or I'll break everything in here! Forget it, kid, drop it. - It's fine, just forget it. - Your friend's much more reasonable. - Give us the dough, hurry. - Half or take the watches. You want me to shove you through the glass? Is that what you want? Stop shouting, you'll kill him! He's got diabetes! Let him go, he's an old man! - Calm down. - You're a lucky bastard! Give me that, piece of shit. Come on. Please excuse us. Kiki baby, be quiet or you'll hurt your head again. You should still think about the watches, okay? - You're here. - Hello. Who's that? Oh, it's you. I see you're busy. I'll leave you to it. - Marie- - Gabrielle, are you in here? - You're not? - Who is it? - It's Denis. Is this a bad time? - No, I'm washing my hair. Okay, I'll come by later. No, come in, you can hold my jugs. - Should I try again? - Yeah. But this time, aim for my head. I must have looked real dumb with that joint. It probably wasn't fresh. Since I didn't smoke any tonight... I was thinking we could have another go at sex. I can't hear a word you're saying. I said my room's busy, I don't know where to sleep. You don't know where to sleep? More like with whom. - A bit of both, really. - Right. I have a solution, but I'm not sure if you'll agree. For now, just dry my back. Instead of standing up, I could dry you on the bed. Just saying... I have two surprises for you. - One to drink, and one to say. - What is it? - Got any glasses? - No, just bowls. - Just a sec. - Hey, there! What's the surprise you have to tell me? I'm not leaving. I'm not going to New York. - It didn't work out with your teacher? - It did, I just don't want to go. But this trip was important to you. Well, I changed my mind. I won't die if I don't work with him, you know? Can you open it? And this won't be a problem for your career, you're sure? We'll see. Go on, open it. Mathilde, why did you change your mind? You don't catch on quick, do you? Yes, I do catch on quick. That's what bothers me. It bothers you? You don't want me to stay with you? I don't want you to ruin your life for me. That's my business, François. I can ruin my life for whoever I want. Don't say that. That's bullshit. No guy is worth doing that for. - Not one. - I think one guy is. Do you know where Denis and I were tonight? We were selling stolen coats to a conman. Do you know what we call a musician, who's a musical genius, sure, who's forced to do that to eat? We call that a loser. In six months, you'll see you ditched everything for a loser. You'll look at me with contempt in your eyes. I don't want to see that in your eyes. I love you, François. Don't you get that? I've never wanted to be with someone like this before. Don't you think it's worth taking the risks? Anyway, it's up to me to decide. Listen, Mathilde, I'll have plenty of girls in my life. Don't do it for me, I'm not worth it. I think I got it now. Seeing me leave makes you happy, so I'll leave the champagne. So you can celebrate. François, take me to the hospital. I've burst my lungs. - Sorry to bother you. - It's fine, we're done. What are you talking about? We were just chatting, but I must have gotten too excited. I felt something rip in my lungs. Don't start, it's not the time. No, I'm serious. I think I'm about to faint. You've been "dying" for the seven years I've known you! Forget it, okay? Okay, fine. Fine, forget it. - Marie- - Gabrielle can help me walk. You've got to be kidding me! Shall I come? - It's fine, François is here. - Of course he is! - Well? - Hemorrhaging and a weak heart. Get the operating room ready. - Doctor, is it my turn yet? - One second. - I was here before this man! - Alright, take him in. Holy cow! It's getting worse and worse. It's like someone's scraping my lung with a stick. So, you're back again. What's wrong this time? I feel anxious. My legs hurt. - There's nothing wrong with you. - Yes, there is! Are you sulking? - I said I'm anxious. - You're fine! Fine, sulk if you want. That's not true! I'm feeling very weak! This isn't a hotel, ma'am! Aren't you nice? I might be leaving feet first, and you're here moping. Very nice! You're exhausting. I can't breathe, I can't walk! I'm telling you, I'm sick! Listen, I want to have a better memory of you than this, so go find Mathilde and let me die here alone. Cut it out, you're annoying me. Yeah, I'll cut it out. Excuse me for dying while you're making out. Will you stop being such a pain in the ass? Enough! Let me go, damn it! Alright, fine! Leave him alone, he's my best friend! He's the one annoying me! And that nutcase needs to lie down! They say it's the muscle, but I'm not so sure. If they work at night, they can't be very smart. I stole the x-ray to show it to someone else. What do you think? There's a dark spot on the right. Where? It might not be mine, I grabbed the first one I saw. You asleep? No. Still sulking? No, I'm alright. Mathilde left because of me, sorry. No, she left because of me. Let's just get some sleep. It'll be better tomorrow. It sure can't get worse. I can walk on my own, you know? Put me down, damn it! Let me go! Why won't he give us our papers back? - He's checking. - There's nothing to check! - Did you do something bad before we met? - No. Apart from singing at the Humanity Festival once. You should probably get new ones. What the hell did you do to them? Pants, pocket, washing machine. There's the result. Yeah. They didn't give me my guitar back. No, wait, François! I buried it in the squatter's place. "Buried?" It was busted, I didn't want you to yell at me. What do you mean, "busted?" I was attacked by some guys in the subway. There were 15 of them, so they got me. You're a lucky bastard! Yesterday, I'd have smashed your head in for that. But today, I don't care, so whatever. Good thing I waited, then. - I'll pay you back for it-- - Really? With what? I'll find a way. May I remind you, you refuse to go to the subway or sell the watches. Don't bring that up again. You convinced with the squat and coats, but not the watches. Ma'am? They're Swiss, you interested? Sir, Swiss watches? Swiss watches, sir. Swiss watches. Are you interested? You sure? Ma'am, have a look. Just a look, it'll cost you nothing. You could be helping me! You're better at this, you can have mine. - But this was your idea! - I'll explain later. A new crowd's coming in. A new guitar costs 150 of those, so you better get to work. I'll meet you at the hallway of death. No, François, not there! Pull up. Turn right. Turn, parallel. I'm looking for Mathilde. - Can't you see we're working? - I'm looking for Mathilde. She's at Roissy. Her flight leaves in half an hour. - Thanks! - Okay, let's resume. Arms, second position. Pull. I'm borrowing your bike, I'll give it back tonight. I'm not stealing it, I'll bring it back! Don't be a dick! Sir, you interested? It's 200 bucks. I was going to keep it, but you can have it for 150 bucks. It's good-- Shit! It's no longer for sale! My husband didn't do anything, he's got diabetes! But he's going through all our stuff! He's going to make a mess! - Let us do our job, ma'am. - Your job is shit! Messing up the homes of honest people! Turn that radio down, it's too loud! Hell no, I won't turn it down! I don't see why I can't listen to my opera as loud as I want! It's not fair, we've never hurt anyone! That's 15 car radios. Those are ours, we saved up for them! You saved up for 60 pairs of sugar tongs too? That must be why he's got diabetes! That's mine! It's our wedding present from my mother! Cut the crap already! It's surgery equipment. So what? My husband likes DIY! Take all this away. If you take him away, I'll blow this place up! Will you shut the hell up? Don't worry, Kiki. They're just a bunch of assholes. Those two little fags must have ratted you out! Oh, no... What are you doing here? You didn't leave? What I said yesterday was a lie. You're the only one I love. I didn't want you to make a mistake. I figured that. You were right. I've thought about it all day. I'm leaving tonight. Being right sucks. Go on, hurry. A year isn't that long, you know? See you later, then. See you. François! Let's go, the cops are after us! Cops? Wait for me! You're crazy, you threw the watches away! How will we pay him back once he's out of jail? We better stay away from him, he thinks we ratted him out. The guitar lesson wasn't enough? - So, it was you? - Just leave it. You want another lesson? I don't get it. We're going to get killed. Come on! Give it to me. This way, on the right! I don't hear them anymore. - Don't stand there. - Wait... Look out, Denis! - You okay? - I'm fine. EXIT EXIT I think we didn't understand each other. Look out, François! Watch out! - You got him! - Denis! Shit, that really hurts! - Denis... - It hurts. - Let me see-- - No, don't move me. I'd rather not look, it freaks me out. - It's fine, I'll take you to the hospital. - No, I can't move. Stupid, isn't it? It's like The Boy Who Cried Wolf. I cried "wolf" so many times, no one believes I'm dying now. Cut the crap. I need you. What would I do without you? That's nice of you. In the end, you do like me. Oh, shit! As dumb as you are, why would I stick with you if I didn't like you? So, I have to be dying for you to be nice to me. Isn't that nice? You're such an asshole! "An asshole?" If I hadn't done that, they'd still be beating us up! Don't you know what you just did to me? You'd rather have me die for real? You bastard! - If you do that again, I swear-- - It was partly true, look! What a bastard. A real bastard. We better hide in a neighborhood where we can be forgotten. Where should we go? I might have a plan, I don't know. We'll see. Tell me your plan, damn it! I can't explain it to you yet. I hate it when you can't explain, it freaks me out. You're hogging all the newspapers. No, I'm not. Yes, you are. I've only got the sports page. Come on, let's go, it's daytime. It was a great idea to cross the Atlantic on a banana boat, I love the smell. - I'll have to incinerate my clothes. - You never stop grumbling. We're going to Manhattan, isn't that amazing? Yeah. New York is eight million people, like 150 dance classes, 3000 heart attacks a year. Yeah, so what? You're 80 times more likely to get a heart attack than to find Mathilde, that's what. Here, nothing's impossible. I can feel it. - That's what I'm worried about. - Did I force you to come? - No. - Well, then? I still have a question. It's just a tiny detail, but how will we eat? There are lots of beggars here, you know? With the shit you pulled in Paris, we can't get deported back. You could at least answer! We're here because of you. Look, it's not complicated. Here's your dollar. And your banana, pal. There you go. See ya, and walk in the shade! Fine, I'm better off. I should have done this long ago to stay out of trouble. - Hello? - Hello? Yes. I'm a friend of Prosper. - He gave me your phone number. - You're in New York? - Yes. I don't have the address. - That trick doesn't work on me anymore. Right... On the 47th. Okay, see you in a bit. Sure, no answer. Holy cow! What's the matter now? Nothing, leave me alone. How do you say "acute appendicitis" here? I don't need your help. Just tell me how to translate it, I can handle things on my own. You won't be able to pronounce it. Come on.
