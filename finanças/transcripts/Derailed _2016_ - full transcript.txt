You always said it's plastic surgery. It's true! Every girl on TV did it. Open it. Give me my T-shirts. - I want it. - Okay go ahead. Only 8? Isn't it cool? It's too short! You know it's winter now. Why'd you pull it out? Wow, jackpot. We can sleep in a warm place tonight! It's not working. Oh! Enough! That's fucking disgusting. They're here. Hello. Wow, Honda! Key. Money. Let me just kick it first. Don't worry, I'll be here. Give me the key. We're not gonna run away! Key, please. Bye, bye. What the fuck! Mother fuckers! Fuck! You think you're gonna be fine?

I feel disgusting. I wanted to sleep under a soft blanket. Let's just eat first. We did jobs only to get kicked without being paid. How about a hooker scam? - Then we can make money. - They don't. - We need to settle bills. - Min-kyung. Didn't you tell me that you were rejected? Who would do that to you? Look who's talking! How about me? What the heck are you talking about? Or where we sleep? In a sauna? Still you can't. Let's do it for the last time. Why? Are you scared? No. That is not the reason. You're so pathetic. What shall we do then? How could you not say anything? Are you okay if Min-kyung goes to a motel with other guys? But it's not like anything's gonna happen. Dude, you need to grow up. Are you going to live like that forever? More soup please. Wait! Hey, wait! You jerk! I need exercise. It's fucking hard. Give a call to girls. Excuse me. Angelina Jelly, right? And I am terminator. It's nice to meet you. Get in the car. I'm not. You are not what? You are not what? Then what are you doing here? I know you are the one. It's okay. Get in the car. Well, I'm just gonna go home. Hey, watch out. You can't just go like this. I drove all the way here with cash for you. Or do you want to eat something first? Let's just go to a motel. Get in the car then! DERAILED Come on in. Take a seat. Well, there's nothing to drink... I'm gonna take a shower first. No, you don't need to. Come here for a second. Come here. Why? Just wanted to talk. Come on. About what? You gotta listen first if you wanted to know. What's the hurry? Drink this. You must be hot, right? Why? Just curious. You are so grumpy. There's something that I wanted to talk to you. Why don't you stop doing this? How about making some money with me? She told me to call you after she gets to the motel. When was it? Just before I called you. Then why didn't she send the room number yet? I'm not a bad guy. I run a karaoke bar. I try to help girls like you who have nowhere to stay. By giving a job and place to stay. Listen. I think you are really attractive. If we are together, we could make good money. You can make money having fun like you did with your friends. Hey, a man and a girl just got a room, right? What? I know they did! I saw them. Answer the question! W...Why? She's his girlfriend! Even a teenager! Forget it. Call the police. What is the name of this motel? Find out the name! I'll send them to jail. Answer me! Quickly! It's way better than what you're doing now, isn't it? I'm not interested. Just let me take a shower. Wait. Why do you want a shower? Think about it. Do you want to live like this forever? Ga-young! What the... - Are you okay? - Yeah... Are you okay? Hey! Come here. You little bastards. I can give you a lesson. Where are you going? Come here. What are you guys? Where did you learn this shit... Mother fucker. Get out and start the car! Shit! I'm still shivering. Ga-young, why did you go there? He was such a monster. And why didn't you answer the phone? I tried to go to the bathroom to call you. But he kept talking to me. About what? He owns a karaoke bar. He said I'm attractive. What? Was it a job interview? But we got this car. So we can get a room when we sell it. Yeah, we can stay warm this winter. Let's buy an electric mattress, a washing machine... and a rice cooker! Are you happy? Huh? Why are you being a jerk to her? Hey, we got a fucking card too! Let's go get some steak! - Korean beef! - Yeah! This BMW is so fucking comfortable. Hey, just don't do that. Don't do that. They close at 2am. Let's eat first, okay? I'm hungry too. But I want seafood. Like pasta. Min-kyung, pasta is not seafood. And gluten makes you fat! Shit! Let's just eat first? I want to eat! We gotta take care of the car first. We can't keep driving around. We can't sell it that quickly. I'm gonna die from hunger before then. It can be done soon. See? Check this out. Shit... Look at this. Car model? BMW 5 Registration card? Of course not. Three thousand dollars? Are you kidding me? Okay. Okay for what? They're here. Hey, Jin-il. Guys, run! Run! Shit! Why? Why? Just run! Ga-young Choi. Ga-young! Ga-young! You guys all are here. - Jin-il Jeon! - Run! Hurry! Pick up the key. Run! Little bastards. It's okay, okay. Ga-young! Jin-il! Where are you? Little bastards. I've been missing you so much. Come on out! Jin-il. You seemed so grown up. And Ga-young is such a big girl now. Where are you? It's been ages since we saw each other. Fucking come out to hear how I enjoyed prison! What? What! Mind your own business! What the hell are you doing? What are you fucking watching? Sorry. Stop it! Fuck! Come out. Jin-il! Enough, stop it! Ga-young! Gel the fuck off of me. Run and hide from me forever bitches! What happened? What the hell are they? How do you know? No big deal. You looked scared as shit. I wasn't, you bitch. You were the fastest. I thought you were sprinting. No, that was to cover you! Who were they? Let's go get some pasta. I checked the card payment history. I've been checking so far. They paid at some place named Gung-karaoke? Come and pick me up. No, they took my wallet and everything. Just come fucking ASAP. Okay. Hey, thank you. I'll pay you when my boys come. And give me a cigarette. I saw you smoking there. Just give me one. Damn skinny...hard to suck. Lighter. This is not pasta. There are noodles in the soup. We should have gotten steak first, and then we wouldn't have lost the BMW. Learn how to use chopsticks first. You useless idiot, who can't even use chopsticks? Ask for more side dish. Some more side dish and soup, please! Gung-karaoke? Can I know the exact address? The parking lot? Okay, I got it. - You know the paid parking lot. - Yeah. Go there. Jesus, these kids are really... Shit, hurt. Twelve what? Twelve forty-five. My nephew and his friends stole my card and were using it. Oh, they looked like college kids? It must be the kids in room 6. They left before you came. How long? About an hour ago? We got another report. Mr. Hong's pork stew? Do you know where it is? You little bitch. Gi-deok, come over. You get in. Shit! Get up. Get up, mother fucker. Stand up! Come here. Come here. Come here, mother fucker. Jin-il! Go...Run away! Hey, you! Come here. Hey, stop recording! My little spoiled nephew. You stole your uncle's car and money? Only to drink and hang out with girls? How could you do this if you think about your father? You ungrateful little bastard. Get in the car. Hey, get in the car. Stealing money of his own uncle's? Kids are so spoiled these days. You little bastards have lost your minds. What the hell are these shits. So many cellphones. Stolen ID cards. He turned off his phone. Check his ID at the online used car market and write it down. Boss, his parents are really dead. And this little asshole went to jail for theft. And that girl? She has a single mom and step dad. Got it. Go stand at the counter. Yes. And order something to eat. I'm hungry. Okay. - Which one is hers? - Here. Hey, stop crying and come here. Call your mom. You lost my car! Call her. It's pointless. She wouldn't help. Do it or we will beat your boyfriend. It's me. Ga-young... She hung up. Try again. Come on. Fine! Let the police arrest me then! Hey, give it to me. - I'm not gonna call you again. - Give it! Hello, hello? You must be Ga-young's mom. Well, I don't know where to start... Your daughter has been hanging out with some bad boys, and just happened to steal my car. I'm the owner of the car. What? Ma'am, hold on and let me finish... How do you expect me to handle this? She's under-aged and stole my...hello? She just hung up. What a fucked-up family. You got the CCTV recording, right? Give me that. Your friends had the car ready, do you see? And I can see Jin-il there. Do you see how clear it is? Do you know how cold these days are in jail? 10% of interest plus 5% of my fee comes to 23,100 dollars in total. You'll pay back 150 everyday, for 154 days. If you don't pay on time, the 'legal' interest will be 39% per year. Remember it's legally correct. If you understand, print your name and sign here. We need this memorandum, as you don't have any collateral. You are a risk for fleeing. Until the debtor pays off to creditor, the debtor is obligated to work at the creditor's bar. The debtor stays in the designated place. Sign here. Good? Are you both satisfied? Okay then. Deal done. You can go now. Your girlfriend is paying for you. So be good to her, asshole. And make sure to marry her later. Got it? If I get you the money, Will she be free? You little bastard. Am I holding her hostage? It's just she pays me back by doing actual work. Get me the money, then I'll let her go. Don't even think about being a hero. Don't bother calling the cops. It's all legitimate. Good? Well. It's the last night for you two Enjoy your time alone. I should pay you back first with that money? Then what, should I just walk around without a car? That is fucking stupid. Have you ever paid back on time? Dude, I'm really in trouble. Look at your face, bitch. And tell me for who I spent personal debt. Why are you giving me this all of sudden? Wait a little more. The president revised the national policy in a day. Why are you bullshitting me? It was you who decided to invest money. What are you talking about? You talked me into it. You lured me to invest, didn't you? Do you really think that I've done it by myself? Fucking asshole? That's why I'm doing this shit here. Those kids aren't any older than my daughter. I'm fucking humiliated to live like this. Keep quiet, asshole. Take a shot. Go. I'm okay. Ga-young... 20,000 dollars? It's nothing. One week is more than enough. I promised you didn't I? I'll protect you. Jin-il! What happened to your face? Where is Ga-young? Jin-il, where is Ga-young? What happened to her? Hurry, hurry! Hurry. Be a good girl. Boss, do you want a ride? It's all packed. Just go. - We'll see you later, boss. - Okay. Hey kid! What time is it? It's 8:13 13? Let me see. Hey! Give it back! There's a thief! Give it back! You are slower than me? I was hit by a bat. Let's take a nap and meet up with Mr. Jang later. No more good night sleeps from now on. We're gonna rob cars, public bathrooms, jewelery shops, you name it. Where are we gonna sleep? Let's go to Yongsan Station. How about a sauna? We don't have money for that. - Put your clothes where they belong. - Look who's talking. Give it. Can't you wash before you eat? That's disgusting. Come and join. You must be hungry. Did you clean the room? Yes, I did. Okay, Ga-young. You can use that room from now. You are different from others here. But the door has to be locked when you sleep, okay? We didn't do this kind of business before. That story again? Boring! Well, anyway. The boss owned several big karaoke places in town last year. I'm tired. I'm going to bed. What? I need to call Mr. Jang. It's Jin-il. Let's meet up today. What happened to your face? Control your temper. Five? Do you have a cousin? What? A guy keeps looking for you. Did you tell him about me? No, why would I do that to my business partner? Here. He seemed a little bit odd, who is he? He is a fucking asshole. You can't enter here. Pretty girls are all here! Hey, you can't be here. Hook me up with her. - Who? - That girl is exactly my type. Okay. Ga-young. Come here. Really? He won't come back. He will. Who? Is somebody coming? No. For her, advance booking is required. I'll match you up with another girl and free beer. - Does anyone want to go with him? - I will! - Good. - Hey, handsome, let's go. Do you party hard? Sure I do. I'm the best in this bar. She is such a party animal. Wow...You really came back. Huh? Here, 860 dollars. Wow, look at you! Count them and give me a receipt. Is your body okay? Can you walk around? Right. I'll write it down here. I'll record. Say that you received 860 on December 16th. On December 16th, what's your name again? Do it again. And it's Jim-il Jeon. Jin-il Jeon paid back 860 dollars on December 16th. But, he still owes 23100 after 860 is deducted. 22240 dollars left. Which is fucking a lot, right? I want to see Ga-young. Go wait on room 2. I'll send her there. Don't be stupid. If you try to run away, You're gonna start all over again. We can offer all kinds of liquor for 150 bucks. 50 bucks for a blowjob, you'll get a special for an additional 100. You told me that 200 covers everything, didn't you? How is that possible when the booze costs 150? That little bastard really came back? I told the bastard not to work. Did you work? Did you work? Drink with guys? Where did you sleep? At a dormitory. Where at? I don't know. They drove me there. Hey. Did you see her? How's she doing? What a real man? Huh? He is such a young romantic. Cool! Hey, Bong-gil. What? Let's hit the karaoke bar. Those two are just drivers and touts. The fat bastard is alone at the bar. Let's take him down, and run away with Ga-young. My daughter is still at home? Dad is home. My little angel is home! You're back. My daughter. - When is your test? - Did you miss daddy? Next week. Hey, dad's here. Didn't you miss me? I did. - Right, me too. - Be prepared for the test. Okay. Why don't you eat this apple? An apple a day is good for you. - If you eat, I'll give you some money. - How much? Twenty. Thirty. Okay, here, thirty. There you are. Thirty bucks. - Oops, 10 has just popped out - Yay! You are spoiling her. What the hell is this? You said this apartment is safe! I told you not to trust Won-sick, the little con man. What are you gonna do? Look at me! You know I'm shy, just let me through. I told you! Look at me when I talk to you. See? I'm looking at you, now let me take a leak. Do you want me to tell your daughter that you blew everything? So we can't pay for her lessons? Do you really want that? Hey You better watch your mouth, lady. What is wrong with you? I'm talking to you now. So what the hell are you gonna do? Gi-doek, hold on a sec. Seriously. Seriously! Hey, put me down! Why are you so noisy? Why are you so whiny? Hey, open the door! Okay, yeah? Made a meeting plan? Okay, good. Leave Sung-sup at the dorm, you can be alone. I'm leaving now. Okay. Oh, there they are. Is this the car? You are the one who took the stolen BMW, right? Hey, come here. Take him. Come here, little bastard. Mother fucker. Fuck! Fucking assholes. Get in! You little mother fucker. Hey! Hey! Put yourself together. Hey, hey! Where is my car? What the fuck are you smiling at? Where is my car? I don't know. Could be in China or Vietnam. You little brat. Put that off. Hey, stop beating him. What are you gonna do? Go to police? Or pay us back for the car? Twenty grand is the price for the car. Bring the money then we're all good. Thirty, idiot, including the medical bill and compensation. Do you have money? No. Are you kidding me? Let me handle this one. Fucking assholes. What? Okay, okay. Enough. Let me deal with it. Your Audi must be jacked, right? We'll keep that until you come back with the money. I said I don't have money. No money, huh? Bring me the contract of your apartment and your ID. Then I'll help you make money. I know that Audi only costs 4 or 5 grand. Your stamp, registrations for resident and car, Power of attorney and driving license They will make your debt 5 grand less. Okay? Are you happy? I won't drive a jacked car. We are gonna sell it. I'll do that. Let me ask you a question. Where are the kids that stole your BMW? How do you know them? Why do you want to know that? You are together? Here, 3700. Give me a receipt. Hey! Hey! Look at this! Unbelievable. Have you even stabbed a man? Huh? What a stupid asshole. What the hell are you bothering me for so much! Stop! Stop it! I'll work for you, asshole! I'll do the prostitution too! Jin-il! Jin-il. I'm okay, I'm okay. Don't do this anymore. Jin-il! Look at me. Look at me please. Hey, hey. Son of a bitch. Lift your head. Jin-il... There are people who can't sleep well these days. They are the owners of cellphone stores. Bricks, side kicks and many methods were used by the thieves. Four males broke into the cellphone store. They used blocks of pavement to break the window. Hey, dude! Why? I got a lot this time. How much can you give me in cash? Did you see the news? That is us! Yeah, in that area! What are you talking about? I know you deal with China in cash. Forget it. I'm not selling them to you. I've got 150. When is the money ready? Don't screw up this time. I know. But do we really have to do this? What? Ga-young told us that she can work. And I'm also scared too. Let's just wait and see. She is not going anywhere. Min-kyung, if you were in the same situation, I would do the same for you. Shit. Yes! Good job, guys. You work so hard in this weather. Is this it? Let me check the products first. Show me the money first. Money? What money? Do you have any money? Money? - I didn't bring any. - Of course. What the fuck is this? It's fucking heavy. What the! Are you fucking kidding me? He got a jack knife. Hey, Jin-il. You cheated me? Huh? Brought a knife? Hey, you! Do you have something like this? Wait... Do you have something like this? This is fucking ridiculous. What the fuck is wrong with him? Shit... Fuckers, hey! Dude! Dude! Hey! Bong-gil, are you okay? I'm fucked. - Are you okay, Bong-gil? - Help me. Are you okay? Bong-gil... Let me see. Please be quiet. It's not a big deal. Four stitches will be enough. What are we supposed to do? Min-kyung. It's all your fault. You'll be okay with him dying as long as Ga-young is fine. Let her just work there. Shit! Seriously. How could you. Don't take him anymore. Do it on your own. You are such a dictator. Please keep your voice down. Fuck! You can't even deal with kids by yourself. Whining and begging this busy guy to come help you? You are so pathetic. You were scared too. So you couldn't take them to your bar. What are you talking about? It only took three punches to knock him down. He looked almost dead. Be careful, don't get involved with this freak. He has a criminal record for murder. He made kids who ran away from home prostitutes, steal, sell drugs, and then beat them up. And one of the kids got killed. No wonder a boy who worked for him called the police. He's such a multitasker. How could he get released so early for murder? What can't money do? His family is fucking rich. He got freed on a technicality appeal. That rich asshole doesn't have 30 grand? Ask him to kill me too. I don't want to live as your friend, so embarrassing. What the... Is he acting like a gangster or what? Hey! Come on. Drop the cigarette, asshole. Did you bring them? Give it to me. Check this out. So, are you in touch with the kid who stole your car? Why? What do you want? I just need to see him. Are you gonna beat him for snitching on you? No. Then what? It's none of your business. Do you know where he is? Ha, what an asshole. Okay, if you tell me why, I'll give you the info. Well, he turned me into the police to take my girl. And I had to go to jail. Jail? For what? Killed. It was just unlucky. Really? Good job. - Are they alright? - Yeah. I don't know where he is. I let him go after I got your ID. Would you like to keep in touch, if you were him? Pay back on time. Spending others' money could get you killed. It's okay. Sometimes you get stabbed when you become real man. Honey. Let's ditch Jin-il. Don't say things like that. How can we live without him? We'll die from hunger. They said here. Are you the one who got stabbed? Are you his girlfriend? Yes. Show me your ID card. I don't have one yet. You ran away from home, right? His name is Bong-gil Seon and he's been arrested twice. Tell me the truth. Who'd you get in a fight with? It wasn't a fight. They stabbed when they were mugging me. Stop lying. It's not lying! They attacked me! I am the victim. Hey, hey! What's wrong? You can't treat me like this because I ran away from home. You know Jin-il, right? What? Who? The one who paid for your hospital bill. Look at this. It's you, right? And your girlfriend. Here, Jin-il and Ga-young. We know them very well. Look who is stealing this car. His bag, the same one as Jin-il's, isn't it? The car and the store are only 50m apart. Only within 5 minutes. Where is he? Hey, Jin-il. What happened to your face? Give me 20 grand. Please give me 20 grand first. Uncle! What the hell is wrong with your head? What kind money did I owe? I raise you, fed you, even taught you fixing cars. You ran away and now ask me for money? I need that money! I can't leave without it. Why do you need money? Did you get in trouble again? You should be punished then. Why would I have to give you money? I'll give up the rest of the money. I will not ask my father's left in his will. We are even if you give me 20 grand. I'll give you my signature, and a voice recording. Let's talk later when I'm finished. You gotta give it to me before the bank closes. Go into the office and stop making a scene. We are at Sang-am interchange. And heading toward the World Cup stadium. Where are you going? Don't get too close. Heading straight to Han-gang Park. Why did you give the documents? Are you really giving him money? Why? You think it's waste of money? No...I... Just asking. World Cup stadium intersection. Well, if you're not happy with this, you don't need to work for me. I guess I just made a slip of the tongue. Do you feel sorry to me? Yeah. Say you're sorry. I'm sorry. Say "I apologize. I won't do that again." I apologize. I won't do that again. Jesus, you really did that? The car stopped and a guy's getting out. What are we gonna do? Grab him. Hey, Jin-il. Unbelievable. I gave him my contact just in case. He really reports his own nephew? And you, too. You learned skills from your uncle only to steal a car? Take this. Detective Jang, I'll tell you everything. So please do me a favor. What is i? You know Ga-young. She is caught in a karaoke bar. Please get her out. Shut up! The bar holds underage girls and forces them to be prostitutes. I'll tell you everything other than... the cases on the CCTV. How did you meet Jin-il? At a juvenile center. You met him there first. And after you guys left. I got out of there first, and I went back on the day he got released. Why? When I was there I got bullied a lot. He stopped the bullies. You're back. Hey, dude! Jin-il! Sit down. Why the fuck are you here? They didn't do anything! You didn't even know that I steal cars, right? I didn't know that. Are you guys trying to make up a story in front of us? Shut up! Take him to interrogation room. Yes, sir. What the hell are you talking about? We can't invade another jurisdiction for that case. They're only employing minors. And prostitution. It's hard to raid them on the spot. If you really want to do it, just make a call to the department in charge. So why? Are you that desperate for the incentives? Shut up, to be honest, he played a big role in our promotion. And you were transferred to Seoul thanks to him. That was an old story. Where is your humanity? Imagine if he was your kid. I can't understand. How could you be here? I really don't understand you. Are you out of your fucking mind? Why did you open the door for strangers? Stay in the room, okay? I will. Get the fuck out of my place. Why are you so upset? I'm just trying to ask about Jin-il's whereabouts. I said I don't know. How dare you come to my place? Gel the fuck out! Okay, okay. I'm going. I got your document and registration paper. I'll give you the Audi if you don't try to get revenge for this. What the fuck! Okay, so just get the fuck out And don't come back here again. Hey, let's go. If you bug me again, I'll come back. Just get out. Stop it! If Jin-il contacts you please tell me. I'll give you a Mercedes in return. Ha...what an asshole. And you are so useless. Can't you even handle those kids. I've got his statements. He made a full confession about what he did in this territory. - Hey, Sung-il. - Yeah? Did you get his statement about the stabbing? Yes, I did. Guys, it's not over yet. Answer the phone when I call you. Okay. Send them to a youth shelter. Yes, sir. Ga-young will be released today. When she is out, listen to her. Jin-il... What are you gonna do for a living? I'm worrying about you guys. What a beautiful friendship! Be a good kid at the shelter! It's only 500, not 800. Why? The card's surpassed its limit. Shit! Does it make sense that he's forcing a girl to prostitute these days? There must be something behind it. It's director's orders. And does he really believe what this little bastard confessed? He is not a kind of dude that would lie for his girl. He even went to jail to protect his girlfriend. What? Then I'll buy it for you. My little angel. Okay. I'll call you later. Okay. Good evening! You got some girls here? Well, we have ladies in their 30s. Come on, we heard that you have young ones. We don't have any girls for that. Okay, fine. Let's just drink without any girls. How much is it? Okay. I'm sending him in. Get ready. Let him go. Jin-il. Can you do this? Yeah. When you go in, the undercovers will do everything else. You just ask him for Ga-young, understand? Okay. I'm gonna be late. No, I didn't drink that much. There you are. Here, 500 bucks. What is this money for? I want to see Ga-young. Who? Who's Ga-young? Are you kidding me? What did you say? Call her, now. He looks like a cop. Just go to bed. Mother fucker. Where is Ga-young? Where is she? Do you know Sung-hun? He is also looking for her. Who is Ga-young? Get off of me! Fuck! Mother fucker! Shit! You mother fucker! Shit! Why are you coming alone? She is not there. What? I think he's hiding girls from us. What are you talking about? He smelled that we were cops. Hey! Fuck! Hey! Shit. Stop there! Stop there! Hey! Jin-il! Hey! Shit. - Is he the owner? - Yes, he is. Sneaky pig. What did you do to tip off that idiot? I didn't do anything. - What is he doing? - Don't move. - What the... - What an asshole. You did a good job today. A bunch of cops just tried to raid us. Don't come to the bar, Just hold her for a few days. I'm just gonna send her to Jin-il. Seriously, she's so much trouble... Okay, I gotta go. Ji-eun! My angel! Going to school? Is it your new car? Yes. Let me give you some money. Here you are, thirty bucks! What's the magic word? Thank you. Good girl, listen to your teacher. Study hard! I love you! You're welcome... Hello. Dad... It's me, Jin-il. Hey...hey! What are you doing now? I got your daughter. What? Are you fucking crazy? Where are you? Do you fucking remember Ga-young now? Let her go. You...if you fucking touch my daughter, I will kill you, son of bitch. Cover your ears. Do you want me to make your little girl a woman? You son of bitch! I'm hanging up, asshole. No, hold on a second. I'll take her to you... Where...do you wanna meet us? Send her alone. When she is free and calls this number then your daughter will be free. Hey, don't touch my daughter. I'll let Ga-young go. That is what you want, right? Jin-il! Why? What happened to Ji-eun? I'll give you an hour. What happened? Tell me something! Shut up! Tell me what happened to her? What happened to our daughter? What happened? Why? Hey, tell me! Hello. You told me that you want to meet Jin-il? You want him? I'll give you an address. When you get there call me. Okay?
