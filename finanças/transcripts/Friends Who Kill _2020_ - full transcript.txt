(energetic cheerful theme music) (slow dramatic music) (gentle slow music) (trophies clattering) (suspenseful slow music) (wine trickling) (suspenseful slow music) (screaming) (hockey stick thumps) (slow gentle music) (birds chirping) (coffee trickling) (pot clanking) - Lacey, let's get a move on. (yawns) Come on lazy bones, we're gonna be late. Since when do you drink coffee? - Oh kids are just growing up so much faster these days. (pot clatters) Ready? - (slurps) What about breakfast? That is not breakfast. - I need you to sign my math test. - What happened? - I got a 61. - I can see that. Why did you get a 61? - Okay fine, I'll just get dad to sign it. (sighs) - I know things have been a little bit rough the last few months, but that doesn't mean you can let it affect your grades. - It's one bad test, mom. - It's one bad math test. Didn't I just sign your English exam last week? - (sighs) It's not a big deal. - It is a big deal, honey, you're applying to colleges and you want to get a scholarship? - Well I didn't have time to study last weekend. - I see. - Mom, I only get to see dad once every two weeks. I'm sorry that I don't wanna study the whole time. - [Mom] Lacey. - I'm gonna be late. - We're gonna discuss this tonight. - Sure. - Ah, not so fast. Breakfast. - Oh wow mom, this is too much. (gentle cheerful music) - [Mom] Okay, you have everything you need? - Backpack, banana, I think I'm ready for whatever the day throws at me. - Straight home after school, okay? I should be home by 3:00. - Which means 8:00. - Hey, have a good day, okay? I love you more than anything. - See you at 8:00. (sighs) (car engine humming) (distant people chatting) - Hey. What cha doing? Mom's home cooking. What's this? - It's for my blog. - Oh, you're still doing that? - Yes, I'm still doing that. You have your newspaper and I have-- - You post pictures of bananas on the Internet. - Hey it's been picking up since my-- - Since your dad left? Fine, so you blogged your banana. (laughs) But, how'd it go with your tests? - Uh, well my dad signed history and my mom signed math. - So neither of them know how you're actually doing. - Well neither of them actually care, so. - Hey, why don't we hang out this weekend? Bake some cookies, study a little. - You don't have to study. - But I do need cookies. - Mm. - And I can help you get caught up. - Yeah, I'm kind of a lost cause. - Hey, watch what you say about my friend, Lacey. She just had a couple bad tests. I'm sure Mr. Boleyn will give you extra credit if you ask. - Yay, homework. - Hey this is me, Harper, best friend since kindergarten, co-survivor of the attempt to dye your hair red in eighth grade, let me help you with this. - Fine. - Okay, so after school, oh my, I'm so sorry, I didn't see you. - I noticed. - I didn't mean to-- - Don't worry about it. You can make it up to me by telling me how to get to Mrs. Waldron's homeroom? - Trust me, you don't wanna go there. - No, but I'm supposed to. (laughs) - She's my homeroom too, so I'll just, you can come with me. - [Harper] Are you new here? - Yeah, I just transferred from West Hills, Cassie Larson. - Lacey, this is Harper. - So what brings you to North Haven? - Uh, I'm here because of my truant officer. (laughs) I'm joking, my mom got a new job. - A new job, my mom got one of those. - Oh, has it ruined your life too? - No. Sort of? (laughs) Uh, my parents just got a divorce. - A divorce, my mom just got one of those. - Sorry to hear that. - So was I, especially when I found out it meant I was getting a new high school right in the middle of senior year. - Oh, yeah I guess you win. - Lucky. (laughs) - North Side's not so bad. You'll like it here. - It's too late. I already decided not to. (laughing) Relax Annie Camden, I'm just giving you a hard time. - Um, was that a 7th Heaven reference? - Guilty, I am a huge nerd. - Oh my gosh, I was blogging about it last week, wasn't I, Harper? - Yeah, you love your 90's TV. - Oh my gosh, me too. (laughing) (bell rings) - Oh uh, we should get to class. Um, I'll see you at lunch? - Mmhmm. - Kay. - She seems sweet. Do we like her? - Harper? We've been friends since kindergarten. - But? - No, no but. - But if there was a but? - She can be a little-- - Sweet. - (laughs) It's just, it's been rough since the divorce and she just tries to make everything better. - And you just wanna be ticked off. - For a while. - (laughs) I think you and I are gonna get along. (laughs) - [Hope] Come on, pick up. - [Recorded Voice] You've reached David Carter, please leave a message. - David, it's Hope. We need to talk about Lacey, please call me back. Sorry Nina. - Everything okay? - Lacey's failing math. - She's still having a hard time, huh? - Honestly, I don't know. I'm worried about her. I feel like ever since the divorce, she's just been completely shutting me out. - Well what about David? - He's checked out. I don't know what they're doing during their weekends together, but it's not math homework. (laughs) I just hope I haven't screwed things up forever. - She'll bounce back. - Yeah. - Hope, you're a good mom and she's a good kid. Just give her time. - Thanks. So are we all set for the Mitchel deposition? - Is that today? Whoa, it was a joke. We're all set up in the main conference room. - (laughs) Sorry, I'm a little on edge. I feel like I haven't slept in weeks. - Look, I know you've been out of the game a while and this is a tough case to try to pick up where you left off-- - No, no, no, I'm fine. I can handle this. - I know you can. You did a great job with witness prep. (gentle slow music) - I knew it was coming. My parents were fighting all the time. When they started talking finally, I knew what they were talking about. - Least you had some kind of warning. My parents never really fought. They just kind of quit talking and one day I came home and my dad didn't. - I'm sorry. - (laughs) You know what? I actually hate those words. I'm sorry. Like everyone says it like it's so much better if they feel bad. Your dad left us, I'm sorry. - (laughs) We blew up your life and now you never get to see us anymore. I'm sorry. - Everything sucks now. I'm sorry. - So sorry. - I'm sorry about that. - So, so sorry about that. (laughs) - Hey. I was looking for you. - Well Cassie and I have the same schedule so just came to lunch together. (laughs) - Sorry. (laughing) - Um, okay, I have to stay a few minutes after school to help Mr. Carr with the newspaper. Do you wanna just meet in the newspaper office at 3:30? - Uh, Cassie's actually giving me a ride home. - Oh, okay. So just meet you at your house? - Oh, you're coming too? - What? - To Lacey's. - I invited Cassie over. - I thought we were gonna study. - We have all weekend. - I know but-- - Lacey was just going to give me the lay of the land since I'm new here. You don't mind, do you? - Of course not. - So, Lacey tells me you guys have been friends for a really long time. - Basically forever. (laughs) - That's great. When my parents got divorced, I found out who my real friends were. Some people just didn't wanna hear me out. - Well Harper is a great listener. - Well it's nice to have somebody who'll just listen without trying to fix things. - Meaning? - Nothing, just-- - Divorce just sucks. (laughs) Harper, you don't really get it. And sometimes cheering up and studying and looking on the bright side, it just makes things worse. - I know it feels that way, Lacey, but you can't just wallow-- - Sometimes people need to wallow for a little while. - And you can't make everything better. - Well, when you're done wallowing, let me know so we can study. - Harper, Harper. Harper, come on. - Did I say something? - No, no, it's just, we've just been having tension. - Really? - Harper doesn't really get it. I mean I've been writing about it on my blog actually. I don't know. It's been an issue for a while. - I had no idea. - Thank you gentlemen, we'll be in touch. - Correct me if I'm wrong, but that was a complete disaster. - This is me not correcting you. - I'm sorry, I should have spent more time on the jurisdictional issues. - Hope, it's not your fault. He ignored everything we talked about in witness prep and talked himself right out of summary judgment. Idiot. You know what this means? - We're going to trial. - But the good news is, is we are about to get way ahead on our billable hours. I'll get the takeout menus. It's gonna be a long night. - Hey, you ready? - Yeah, I was just looking for Harper. - Oh, well I'm sure she's fine. Come on, let's get outta here. Come on, let me take you home. (laughs) (distant people chatting) (car rumbles) You know what? We should just skip school tomorrow. - Um, no, my mom would kill me if I did that. - Oh, you don't know until you try. - Uh no, trust me, I know. (laughs) - Oh come on, just one class. (doorknob rattles) - Oh, of course she isn't home yet. I got a 61 on my math test and she totally freaked out. (door rattles) - 61 isn't that bad. It's more than half. See, math. - (laughs) Yeah, you should try telling that to my mom. - It's just a test. She'll be okay. Parents are resilient. (phone rings) - Speaking of. Hey mom. - Hey sweetheart. It looks like I'm gonna be stuck here for a little while longer. So why don't you order pizza for dinner and I'll be home as soon as I can. - I would, but I still think I have some pizza left over last night when you called and said the exact same thing. - I'm sorry, Lacey, things just got a little crazy, but I promise they're gonna settle down soon. How was your bio test? - I don't know. I get my grades back tomorrow. (laughing) - Are you with Harper? - No, Cassie. - Who's Cassie? - [Lacey] Yeah, she's new. I'm just showing her around. - Lace, I gotta go, okay? I'll see you soon. I love you. - Love you too. - Coming. - Let me guess, she's going to be late. - Wow, you are so good at this. - I have some experience. (laughing) So Lacey, I have to ask you a really important question. Did I hear you say you have pizza? - (laughs) Come on. (clicking keyboard) (chair clattering) - Hey, I can't find Wagner versus Robinson in my notes. Where'd you pull that from? - Oh, it's a federal case, third district. - That is explains it. What's up? - Oh, Lacy's waiting for me, and I promised her I'd be home hours ago. - We're in the middle of developing a trial strategy. - I know, I'm gonna work on it from home. Nina, Lacy needs me right now. I have to go. - No, I understand, I understand. But I need your brief tonight. - You'll have it tonight, I promise. - Okay, get outta here. - Thank you. - It's just always the same. You know, Mom's at work. Dad has a date every weekend. I swear if I light myself on fire, they wouldn't even notice. - (laughs) It's definitely worth a shot. (Lacy laughs) Actually, you know, that's not a bad idea. - What? - Light a fire, nothing big. (Lacy laughs) (suspenseful music) Just enough to get their attention. - Yeah, right (laughs). (match flicks) - You were reheating pizza, when you accidentally left the pizza box on the stove. You were so busy studying that you didn't even notice, and then. (Cassie laughs) You should see your face right now. - You're insane. - Oh come on, I was totally kidding (laughs). (door thuds) - [Hope] Honey, I'm home. - Wow, eight on the dot. - Oh, I'm sorry sweetheart (smooches). - [Lacy] Mm-hm. - Hey there. - Hi, Mrs. Carter, I'm Cassie. Thanks for having me over. - You're Lacy's new friend. - Yes, I just transferred in. - Oh, in the middle of the year. - Or her parents got a divorce. - Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Well, it is getting a little late. - Oh, I know, but Lacy and I were just about to start studying. We have this English quiz tomorrow, and we went over the material at my old school but now there's this new book, so I thought we could help each other out. - Well I'm very happy to see you're making an effort with school. - [Lacy] Mm-hm. - Why don't you guys study up in your room? And just don't make it too late. - Okay, thanks Mom, come on. - Thanks, Mrs. Carter. - No problem. What is it? - Nothing, you're just exactly how Lacy described you. She's very lucky. (soft instrumental music) - [Lacy] Okay, so we're not actually going to study. - I don't know anything about English except how to speak it (laughs). - (laughs) Yeah, well it worked. My mom thinks you're a hero. - Really? - [Lacy] Are you kidding? She never lets anyone hang out on a school night, except for Harper sometimes. - Yeah, well. - What? - Nothing, I just, I kinda got a weird vibe from Harper today. - A weird vibe. - I don't know, I just, I don't really trust her. - Oh, really? - You know what? It's probably nothing. - Wait one sec. - What are you doing (laughs)? (shutter clicks) - Oh, just a blog posting about new friends. - Oh, please don't, my hair looks so bad today and you got a chance to straighten yours. - Are you kidding? You look great. - Ew, ew, ew ew no (laughs). Let's try again after I'm finished unpacking and I can actually condition this mess. - You're crazy. - So I've been told. (Lacy laughs) - [Lacy] Oh, I had so much fun. - Me too, it's so nice making a new friend so quickly. See you tomorrow? - Yeah, see ya. - [Cassie] See ya (laughs). (ominous music) - She seems nice. - Yeah, oh she's great. - How did studying go? - (yawns) Oh, it was fine. - And where's Harper? - I don't know. - Everything okay? - Yeah, Mom, everything's fine. Now, I can make new friends, you know. - No, I never said you couldn't. Are you sure everything's okay? - Everything's fine, I'm just, I'm tired, I just wanna get to bed. - Okay, have a good sleep. - Mm. - I love you. - I love you too. (phone dings) (ominous music) - Hey. - Hey. - Can I sit? What's going on? - Just over here, not wallowing, like some kinda monster. - Harper, I know things have been tense between us, but I really don't want them to be. - I don't either. - Great, so we cool? - Well, I'm cool. You're kinda lame. (Lacy laughs) - [Lacy] So what about tonight? - What about it? - Little bit of baking, a little bit of studying. I got my bio test back, 62. - So a little baking and a lot of studying. - (laughs) So, after school? - What's happening after school? - Nothing, just Harper and I are gonna study. - Oh, perfect, do you mind if I crash? I am completely lost. - Sure, Harper's a great teacher. She can catch both of us up. - The more the merrier. - Awesome. - Where you going? - I have to finish the final proof for the newspaper so I can get it to the printer by Monday. - Okay, well, see you later? - See ya. - Am I getting a vibe that Harper doesn't like me very much? - No, no, she doesn't like anyone as much as she likes being editor of the paper. Yeah, she, she won a student journalism award last year for an investigation on the school board. So, she's kind of a big deal (laughs). - Impressive, so do you mind if I sleep over at your house tonight? My mom is getting the new place painted and it reeks. - Yeah, I don't think she's gonna go for a sleepover, especially when she sees this. - Ooh, so just don't show her. - Yeah. - She has to sign it. The teachers here are big on parental involvement and communication, which is ironic seeing as I have neither. - You said this wasn't your first bad test? - Bio, English, math. - Hope Carter, your mom is still using your dad's name? - Yeah, why? - Just making sure. Do you mind if I borrow a pen? - No, here. (pouch zips) - All righty. - Wait, you can't do that. - Are you sure, because I just did. - Wait, how did you do that? - Oh, my guidance counselor says I have a real future in fraud and forgery (laughs). Just tell her the test was fine. - But she's gonna know the truth when she sees my report card. - That's not until the end of the quarter. You will be caught up by then. - Yeah, I guess. - So I will grab my sleeping bag after school and meet you over at your house. - 'Kay. - [Cassie] See ya. - See ya. - [Nina] Hey. - [Hope] Hey. - How's it going? - Good, I think I found a precedent we can use to get the accountant's testimony excluded. It's a little obscure, but, what? - Tom came down to your office last night, and he noticed that you weren't there. It's not a big deal. I covered for you. I told him that I sent you to the law school library to do some research, but. - But I was working from home. You got my brief, right? - Yes, and it was great, but Tom's old school. He wants to see butts in seats. - But Nina, you know my situation. - I get it, Hope, I do. But I can't keep covering for you. - No, of course not. What should I do? - I don't know, but I'd make sure the next time he comes down to your office, you're there. - Okay. (somber music) - So I was thinking we'd bake chocolate chip for studying math, peanut butter for bio, and chocolate peanut butter for English. - Oh, that's a lot of cookies. - But maybe not enough. - We completely neglected the oatmeal category. (doorknob rattles) - Oh, it's open. Mom? (door clicks) Mom. Mom? - [Cassie] Hey guys. (suspenseful music) - Cassie, what are you doing here? - I was hoping to be done by the time you guys got here, but you said you wanted cookies, so-- - So you broke into Lacy's house? - Didn't break into her house. Lacy showed me where the key was hidden, so I blew off last period and I came here to surprise you. Surprise (laughs). You don't mind, do you Lace? - Well, who minds freshly baked cookies? Mm, yum. - So now let's try it with ran. I ran the race. Is that transitive or intransitive? - Uh, transit? - You got it. What about, while she listened to music, she ran? - Intransitive. - (laughs) And insanely boring. - I know it's kinda dry but it's gonna be on the test. - Oh, I think I'm gonna have the flu that day. - You were the one who wanted to study with us. - Hey, I need to get my grades up. - Okay, Willow Rosenberg, don't go dark on me. Let's plow on. - Hm, okay, let's do one more so that we're sure we've got it. She dances a waltz. - Okay, so English is hard (laughs). - (laughs) I think you really got it. - So, what's next? - Probably history. We can save STEM for tomorrow. - Ah, actually I have to call my mom really quick. Do you mind if I use your room? - Yeah, yeah sure. - Where's your mom? - Well, it's eight, so she'll probably be home soon. - She's still working a lot, huh? Don't worry, I'm not gonna try to fix it. (Lacy laughs) You know you're always welcome at our house, Lacy. My mom likes you better than she likes me. - Your mom doesn't like anyone better than she likes you. - Okay, but it's close. Come for dinner next week? - Yeah. - We should get back to it. - Okay, but can we just go into the living room, because I need a change of scenery. - I'll go get our stuff. - Okay. (suspenseful music) (door creaks) - Harper, hi, what are you doing in here? - I'm sorry, Hope, I thought, um. - Is everything okay? - Yeah, fine, I shouldn't be in here. I'm so sorry. - Okay. (ominous music) - Hey, where were you? - Oh I was, nothing. Where's Cassie? - Right here. - I didn't see you in Lacy's room. - My mom didn't pick up, so I had to use the bathroom, is that okay? - Let's just get back to studying. - Sweetheart, how was your day? - Ah, you? - Nah (laughs), what are you girls studying? - Harper got us through English. And now we're on to history. - Transitive and intransitive verbs. - Thanks Harper, how did your bio test go? - I got a 96. - [Hope] What? - Yeah. - That's amazing! - (laughs) Thanks. - You are really turning things around. I guess all that tutoring really is paying off. - Yeah, I guess. - Have you girls had dinner? - Not yet. - Oh, I'll order something. Chinese? - Oh, yeah! - I'm really proud of you, honey. - Thanks, Mom. (footsteps) - Well, that went well. Maybe next time try for an 85, you don't wanna raise suspicion. (phone rings) - That's my Mom. I'll be right back. - All right, well. What next? Civil War or... - 96? I saw your test Lacy. What are you doing? - I'm trying to get my Mom off my back? - By lying to her. You think she wants to hear your score when she signs your test? - She's not gonna sign it. - What do you mean? - Nothing. Just, don't worry about it. Okay? - Lacy, is Cassie putting you up to this? - What? No. No. Can we just study? - Yeah, and an order of Spring Rolls. Great, thanks. - Hey, I saw you called. - Hey, yeah. Yesterday. - Yeah, I was busy. - Well, I think that your daughter takes precedents over your girlfriend. - I was busy with work. - Yeah, I joined the club, David. - Okay, look. Are we gonna talk about Lacy finally or are we gonna argue on the phone all night? - Look, David. I'm worried about our daughter, okay? Her grades are slipping, she barely talks to me anymore. She's making new friends. - Okay. Hang on, sorry. She's making new friends? That's a problem now? - No, but-- - Well, look. She told me that she was struggling a little bit in history, but she was pulling it up. I signed her test. - What, history? - [David] Yeah. - David, I just signed three tests for her other classes in the last two weeks. - Oh, okay. You know what, I'll talk to her. - Okay. Well I mean, she is trying. She's studying with Harper right now and she did really well on her bio test yesterday. - Well great, so what's the problem? - The problem is I didn't know any of that yesterday when you didn't call me back. - Yeah, or maybe the problem Hope is that you are overreacting again. - I am not overreacting. - Hope, you've been overreacting ever since-- - Since what? Since I found out you were sleeping with your secretary? - You know what, this conversation is over. I'll talk to Lacy on the weekend. - David? Great. (door closes) (spooky music) - [Lacy] I'm getting my grades up anyway. So what's the difference? - [Harper] I don't like the way you act around her, Lacy. It's like you have nothing to lose. - [Lacy] What does that mean? - [Harper] I don't think she's a good influence on you. - Okay, I'm back. Let's buckle down. Intransitive Phrasal Verb. - Okay, so. Let's start with Gettysburg. - So, how is the studying going? - It's fine. - Better than fine. Harper really knows her stuff. - Well, she takes after her sister. How is dinner like in NDSU? - Good. She is coming home this summer for her internship. - Tell her we have to hang out, because I want to hear all about college. - I will. (laughs) - Cassie, how was your first week at your new school? - It's been great, way better than expected. I feel so lucky to have met Lacy and Harper. At my old school, girls just like to tear each other down - Well, that's great. - Yeah, I feel really lucky. It's nice having help getting caught up on all my classes and it's nice having somebody to talk to about the divorce. Especially someone who understands. My parents got divorced around the same time you did and for the same reason. I remember I was so angry when I found out my Dad cheated on my Mom. - Wait, what? - Yeah, my Dad cheated too. - Mom? - Honey, we can discuss this later. - No, we can discuss this right now. - We didn't wanna say anything, we didn't wanna make this any harder for you. - You didn't know? Lacy, I'm so sorry. Harper, you didn't tell me that she didn't know. - What? - Yeah, you told me you were digging around to find out what happened so you could help, but you didn't tell me. - I never said anything. - You knew? - Lacy, I swear I didn't. - Honey. - Lacy. Wait, I'm so sorry. - Hope, I swear I never said anything. I would never. - Harper, is that what you were doing upstairs? Snooping around? - No, I thought I heard something. - You know what, it's getting late. I think it's time you went home. - But I didn't do anything. - We can discuss this later. - I hate them. I can't believe he cheated and they didn't tell me. How long what this going on? - Harper didn't say. I really don't know Lacy. She didn't tell me. - And she was looking into their divorce? - Don't be too hard on her. It's like you said. She's a journalist at heart. She cares more about the story than she does her friends. - And she told you and not me. - I think she must have been trying to show off, to try and get me to like her. I guess. I'm so sorry, Lacy. - I just can't believe it there's no one in my life I can trust. - You can trust me. - Thanks Cassie. I don't know what I would have done if you weren't here. - Hey, what are friends for? - Thanks. - So he denied our continuance. - But he granted our motion to exclude the accountants affidavit. Great work on that. - Yeah, for what it's worth. - It's worth a lot. Look, we're going to trial in two weeks. I'm coordinating the expert witnesses. I want you to drive to an opening. - Okay. I've been thinking about a ''David vs. Goliath'' angle. Big bank goes after a small business man. - Yes, it's perfect. If we get the jury to focus on-- Who's that in your office? - My ex-husband. - You really shouldn't make personal appointments during business hours. - Oh, he doesn't have an appointment. Excuse me. Hey. - I know we've had our problems, Hope. But I never thought you would deliberately hurt our daughter to get back at me. - Nice to see you too, David. - I don't want to play these games. I'm not messing around here. - Hey. Keep your voice down. - I will not keep my voice down. - Hey. You were in my office, with my boss listening. - Okay. - If you want me to lose my job, keep doing what you're doing. But if you don't wanna see your child support payments double because I'm unemployed, I suggest you shut up and listen to me. Now, I'm not the one who told Lacy about the affair. One of her friends did. - Who? How would they know? - It doesn't matter. - Well, now she's not talking to me Hope. She texted to say she's not coming again next weekend. She won't return my calls. - She's not talking to me either. She didn't say a word to me all weekend. - Well, you could have given me a heads-up. - And you could have answered your phone. I called you four times. It's not exactly the kind of news you'd text. - So what do we do now? - I think we sit Lacy down and explain everything. - Yeah, sure. 'Cuz, yeah, it's fine for you. You weren't the one, yeah. When? - Tomorrow. - Yeah, I'll come over after work. - Great, I'll be home at eight. - Well, who's taking care of Lacy? - She's 17 years old, David. She can look after herself for a few hours. - Well, I don't like the idea of her being alone at home for hours on end. - I don't like it either, but I'm not the one who left. - I'll see you tomorrow. - Hey, I tried to call you all weekend but you didn't answer. - Yeah, you didn't take the hint? - Lacy, please. Listen to me. I never told Cassie your Dad cheated on your Mom. I didn't know he cheated, how could I? - Cassie said you asked. - Asked who? - People at his office, people here at school. So now apparently everyone knows. Thanks for that. - How would everyone at school know anything to do with your Dad? That makes no sense. - Oh, and my Mom told me that she found you looking through her closet. What's wrong with you, Harper? - Lacy, none of this is true. - So my Mom is a liar now. - No. I was in her room because I thought I heard something. I think Cassie was in there. - Okay, so. What you're saying Harper, is that Cassie moved here met me, dug into my parents divorce, found out that he cheated and told me, all within 48 hours. How would she do that? - I don't know, Lacy. But I know it wasn't from me. - Cassie was right. - What? - She said you'd act all innocent. - I am innocent. - Lacy, you have to believe me. - Look, I'm sorry Harper. I really don't know what to believe right now. - Hey. - Why does Mr. Burg make us dissect fetal pigs? Why can't we just cut up frogs like normal teenagers? - Yeah. - Hey, what's with you? You've been quite all afternoon. - Nothing. Just some... Maybe I should talk to Harper. - So you can tell her off? Yeah, you should definitely do that. - No, so I can hear her out. - Why? - Because maybe it was just a misunderstanding. - Lacy, I already told you what happened. Are you saying that you don't believe me? - No. She's been my best friend since kindergarten. So. I don't know. - Well, sometimes when you don't know it's okay to let other people know for you and I know that Harper isn't the friend that you thought she was. - I guess. - Come on, I'll get you a caramel-chino. - Yummy. (laughs) (car engine starting) (soft dramatic music) - Hey Mr. Car, it's Harper. I'm so sorry to bother you but I'm at the printer with the newspaper and my login just doesn't seem to be working. It says I need administrative access. I would come back but I have to be home in 10 minutes to babysit so my Mum can go to work. Can I just use your login and I promise to forget it as soon as I-- Thank you. Yeah, I'm ready. J-T-Car? Is that all lowercase? Okay. And-- Mr. Car, ''123456'' is not a password. I'll help you change it tomorrow. Okay. All right, thanks. (soft dramatic music) (door knocks) - Lacy? (door opens) Hey, sweetheart. How was your day? Lacy. You are this close to inheriting my old flip phone. - How was your day? - It was fine. - Okay, I'm happy to hear that. (gentle music) I need you to call your father. - Why? - Because he came by my office today and said you weren't going to see him this weekend? - Yeah, 'cause I don't want to see him this weekend. - Lacy, I know you're upset. - And you're not? He cheated on you. - Of course, I'm upset. I'm furious. And I'm heartbroken. And I'm even more furious and heartbroken because I wanted to protect you from being furious and heartbroken. So, yes, I'm upset. But he's still your father. And you need to talk to him. Okay? Will you call him tomorrow? Are you hungry? - I ate dinner already. - Have you done your homework? Lacy, I scheduled meetings with all your teachers. - Why? - Because your father told me you're failing History on top of everything else. You lied to me. - I didn't lie to you, I just didn't tell you. - Either way, I'm meeting with your teachers. I want to know how you're really doing. - Mom. - It's not up for discussion. I love you too much to let you keep sliding. - I told you I'm doing better. - And if your teachers tell me the same thing, you have nothing to worry about. If you need help with anything, let me know. Okay? I'll be in the kitchen. Hey, I love you. - Love you too. (knocking) - Hi. - Harper, I don't think Lacy is up for talking right now. - Actually, I'm here to talk to you. (door bangs) First of all, I just want to say I'm so sorry for what happened on Friday. But I swear to you, I had nothing to do with it. - Then why did Cassie say you did? - I don't know. But that's not the only thing she's lying about. - What's this? - This is Cassie's student record. - Harper, how did you get this? - Please, just listen. You see here? - West Hills High, like she said. (gentle music) - Right, like she said. I called the school today, and they have no record of anyone by Cassie's name ever attending West Hills. - Maybe they lost her file when she transferred. - They also said they have no record of anyone transferring to Haven High since the beginning of the year. I also called her elementary middle school district. They have no record of her either. - So what are you saying, Harper? - I don't think Cassie is who she says she is. - Isn't it more likely that there's a reasonable explanation? Like maybe Cassie changed her name after the divorce and they have her old name in their files. - I thought about that. But what if Cassie is-- - Listen, Harper, I'm very impressed by your journalistic instincts here. But if you and Cassie are having issues, I suggest you work it out between yourselves. - Hope, please. Something isn't right here. Just promise me you'll be careful with Cassie. I'm telling you, there's something wrong with her. I don't trust her, and neither should you. (suspenseful music) (car engine revs) (car whirring) (car whirring) (doors bang) (women laughing) (door bangs) (clicks) (suspenseful music) (clattering) (clicks) (clicks) (phone clicks) (phone clicks) (dramatic music) - Hey, so, your opening statement. - You have notes. - Just one, it's kind of big. You're brilliant. (chcukling) - What? - It's perfect. The whole part about how Mr. Davis built his business to support the community, it makes me think that we should countersue. - Thank you. (chuckling) - And I'm not the only one who thinks so. - Who thinks we should countersue? - That you're doing a great job. The partners want to meet with you this afternoon to discuss trial strategy. - But Nina, you're first chair. - As first chair, I told them they should hear what you have to say. - (chuckling) Thank you. - Well, thanks to you, we might actually win this thing. So I'll see you at the main boardroom at 3:30? - I'll be there. - [Nina] You'd better. (grunts) - What are you looking for? That cute guy from Bio? - (chuckles) No. No, I'm just looking for Harper. I haven't seen her all day. Have you? - (sighs) No. Not that I've been looking for her. Oh, there she is. What is she doing? - [Cassie] Just go talk to her. - [Lacy] Think I should? - Well, you're not gonna give up until you do. And if it means that I don't have to hear about it for the next four months, then... - Be right back. - I'll be here. - Harper? Harper. (knocks) Harper! Harper. Someone call 911! Harper! (dramatic music) Help! - Hey, ready? - Oh, yikes, yeah, I didn't realize. - Okay, well, come on, we don't want to keep them waiting. - No. (phone buzzing) Hope Carter. What, sweetheart, slow down, please. Okay, what happened? Okay, I'll be right there. I'll be right there. (phone clunks) - What's up? - It's my daughter. There's been an accident. - Is she okay? - I don't know, I think so, but it's her best friend. I-- - Okay, but we have a meeting with the partners. You can't just leave. - I'm so sorry, Nina. Partners will have to understand. - No, they won't. Look, I stuck my neck out getting you this meeting. You can't just blow it off. - Nina, I'm sorry, my daughter needs me. I have to go. - [Nina] Hope. (siren wailing) - Lacy! - Mom. (crying) - Oh, honey. (suspenseful music) What happened? - I don't know, I found her in her car and she had... - Are you okay? - Mom, they don't know if she's gonna make it. - (sighs) Where are her parents? - They're talking to a doctor but can we stay? - Yeah. - Till they come back? - Yes, yes, of course. (sighing) I'm so glad you're okay. - Finally, where have you guys been? Sweetheart, are you all right? My God, I've been trying to call you guys all night. - I was at the hospital. - David, what are you doing here? - We're supposed to meet here. Remember? - (sighing) Right. I completely forgot. - You forgot. Well, there was an attack at our daughter's school. I couldn't find you, and then I come home to find the police waiting. - The police? - Mrs. Carter. Miss Carter. I'm Detective Lee from the North Haven P.D. (tense music) I'd like to ask you a few questions about Harper Evans. - What kind of questions? - Why don't we sit down? Lacy, can you tell me about what happened? - I don't know what happened. - I understand you were the one who found Harper in her car. - I thought she was just sitting in there so I went over, I knocked on her window, but she didn't hear me. And then, when I went to open the door-- - Harper was a friend of yours? - We've been friends since we were kids. - I spoke to some of the other students at your school. They said you and Harper hadn't been speaking recently. - I was... We were in a fight. But it was-- - What was the fight about? - What does this have to do with anything? - Teenagers fight. Emotions can run a bit high. - Detective, can I speak to you outside for a minute? (door bangs) Detective, I hope you're not suggesting what it sounds like you're suggesting. - What am I suggesting? - I'm allowing you to interview my daughter to assist in your investigation. If she's a suspect, I am shutting this down right now. - Mrs. Carter, I'm simply trying to find out what happened. - By implicating my daughter? - Is she implicated? The students at the school say she and Harper had a close relationship. They had a fight. Lacy was angry-- - You don't need to finish that sentence. We're done here. - If we're done here, maybe we can continue this down at the station. - I'm an attorney, Detective. We're not going down at the station unless you have a warrant. If all you have is the fact that two teenagers stop speaking, I think we both know there's not going to be any warrant. (gentle music) Good night. - If you change your mind... - You're with homicide? (tense music) This isn't a murder. - Not yet. Given Miss Evans' condition, it might be by the morning. Good night. (door bangs) - Where's the detective? - He had to go, Lacy. But from now on, I don't want you talking to the police unless I'm there, okay? - Why? - Lace, trust your mom on this one, okay? - Honey, why don't you get ready for bed. You must be exhausted. - Yeah. - Okay. - 'Night, sweetheart. - 'Night. Mom, do you mind if I sleep in your room tonight? - Yeah, of course, honey. - 'Night. - [Dad] 'Night. - What's going on? (sighs) - They're just rattling cages. - Okay. I mean you don't think there's any way that she could've-- - No, of course not. - Yeah, (sighs) I guess a few bad grades isn't such a big deal. - Yeah. I just keep thinking, what if it had been her? (sniffs) - It wasn't. - But it could have been. - Hope, look, it's okay. She's, she's safe. No one's trying to hurt her. - Yeah. - It's fine. She's fine. - I can feel you watching me. - No, no, no, I'm not watching you. (laughs) Okay, I'm watching you. Are you sure you're okay? Are you hungry? - Not since you made me a sandwich five minutes ago. - (chuckles) Right. I know I'm helicoptering. - No, it's okay. I don't mind. - Any update on Harper? - I spoke to her mom this morning. No change. I said I'd go over this afternoon so she can pick Kevin up from school. - Okay, I'll take you. - Don't you have to be at work? - No, I told 'em I was working from home all week. - How did that go? - Don't worry about my job, okay? You've got enough on your plate. (knocking at the front door) (sighs) - [Cassie] Lacy, you home? (door rattling) - [Hope] Cassie, hi. - Mrs. Carter, I noticed Lacy wasn't in school today so I just wanted to come and check up on her. - That's nice of you, but she's sleeping right now. - Oh that's okay, I can wait for her-- - She's actually at her dad's. But I'll tell her you stopped by. - Thank you. I'll be thinking of her. - All right, thanks for coming. - Bye. - Bye. (door clicks shut) Honey, what's going on? - I just don't wanna see her right now. She was with me when I found Harper and she just disappeared. I had to get a ride to the hospital with Lindsey Sherman. - Well maybe she just didn't want to get in the way. - No, I don't think that's what this is. She was really mean to Harper. I don't know, I guess I just, I feel kind of guilty, like if I wasn't ignoring her, maybe none of this would've happened. - Hey, hey, hey, you can't think like that. Okay, none of this is your fault. You had nothing to do with this. (bell notification ringing) What? - (laughing) It's Harper. She opened her eyes. - (sighs) Oh, thank God. - Her mom says she's not talking yet, but he doctors think that she might in a day or two. - Oh. Oh, that's amazing. I told you everything's gonna be okay. (laughs) (slow suspenseful music) (birds chirping) (distant people chatting) (machines beeping) (clipboard clatters) - Hi Harper. (door thumps shut) I hear you're getting better. I'll admit, I'm surprised. I honestly didn't think you had that much fight in you. You can hear me, can't you? (cord clatters) Good. I want you to hear this. Lacy is my friend now and if you think that you're going to take her back, (laughs) you're dead wrong. (dramatic slow music) - Cassie. - Lacy, hey. - What are you doing here? - I didn't know you were gonna be here, but I just came to check up on Harper. - It's funny, you didn't care how she was feeling yesterday. - [Cassie] What do you mean? - You took off, Cassie. - Lacy, no, I ran to get help. I was trying to find the school nurse, but by the time I got back, you two were gone and I didn't know what hospital you were at. - Sorry, I didn't know you were looking for help. - I know Harper and I have had our differences, but-- - Oh, um, I'm happy that you're here. (laughs) - So, did you hear anything? Do they know what happened? - Uh no, no there was no camera in the parking lot and no one saw what happened. So I think the police are just waiting for Harper to wake up and see if she saw anything. - It's scary to think there's someone out there who could do something like this. To attack Harper and put her in her car like that. - What do you mean? - It just seems so messed up, like they wanted somebody to find her. - No, no, I mean, what do you mean, put her in her car? How do you know where Harper was attacked? - No, I don't, I (laughs) I guess I just assumed, you know, with her injuries and stuff. I'm gonna hit the vending machine. You want anything? - No, no I'm good, thanks. - I'll be right back. - Okay. (distant people chatting) (intercom calling) (drawer rattling) (soft suspenseful music) (sighs) Oh, 5,000,000. Okay. (sighs) (soft suspenseful music) (people chatting) Police are asking for help in finding South Hampton student, Jennifer Smith who vanished from her home on the day your step-mother was murdered. (slow suspenseful music) - [Detective] We have her on the security footage fleeing the hospital. - I think I scared her when I asked her how she knew about the attack. - So where is she now? - Well, we checked the address she gave to the school. The woman living there said she'd never seen her, but she did have a daughter named-- - Cassie Larson. - She died several years ago. Jennifer must have been using her identity. Lacy, did she tell you anything that might help us find her? Where she was staying, who she was with? - She said her mom and her moved here. But we never went to her place. She always wanted to come here. - What about her car? - Gray, four doors, I don't know, I didn't pay attention to it. - Did she tell you why she was at the hospital? - She said she was there to visit Harper. You think she was there to finish what she started? - What about you, Mrs. Carter? Did she say anything to you that might help us find her? - Honestly, I've been so wrapped up in my work lately, I wasn't paying attention. So what happens now? - Well, we think she's probably headed out of the state. We've got patrols on the lookout on all the major highways. - What about Harper? - We've got an officer posted outside her door. She's safe. - And what about Lacy? Is she safe? - She never gave you an indication she wanted to hurt you, did she, Lacy? - No. - Well, my guess is, she's 200 miles from here by now, but if you'd like an officer to stay at the house-- - That shouldn't be necessary. My husband's on his way over now. My ex-husband. - Well, if you hear from her, contact me immediately. We should be able to triangulate her position from the cell phone towers. - I guess this was more than just a disagreement amongst friends, huh? - Yeah, I guess it was. Thank you for your cooperation. Mrs. Carter, Lacy. (gentle slow music) (door thumps shut_ - Are you okay? - I just can't believe I let her into our house. I believed her. - Hey, I did too. (phone ringing) It's your father. David. - [David] Hey, I'm on my way. You guys all right? - Yeah, yeah, we're fine, the police just left. - Any sign of her? - No, they actually think that she's probably on her way out of the state right now. - Well thank God. I hope we never see her again. - (sighs) Oh yeah, me too. - Okay, I'm on my way. (sighs) (slow gentle music) How's she doing? - Um, she's all right. - Yeah? - You know, she's pretty shaken up, but she's handling things incredibly well. I don't know if you noticed, but we have an amazing daughter. - I noticed. Well at least we did one thing right. (coffee pot clatters) (door thumps) Amaretto, you remembered. - Well we were married for 18 years. - 18 good years. (Amaretto tinkling) - 17 of them were good. - Look Hope, I don't think I've ever told you how sorry I am, all right? I wish I could take it all back. - I wish you could too. (soft thumping footsteps) (gentle slow music) - What's taking her so long? - She's a teen aged girl. You should try getting her out the door for school in the mornings. - Oh, I miss getting her out of the door for school in the morning and I miss seeing her when she came home from school too. - She misses you too. - Yeah. - Lacy! (gasps) (dramatic music) - Shh shh. - [Hope] Lacy. - I'll be right down. - That means 10 minutes. - Good girl. - Cassie. - Come on, Lacy. You know the truth. Call me Jen. - What do you want? - What do you mean what do I want? I came back for you. Couldn't just leave you behind. - What are you talking about? - I'm talking about taking your life back. From your parents who don't care about you, your friends who don't understand you. I understand you, Lacy, only me. - Cassie-- - Jen. - Jen, just put the knife down, okay? We can get you help. - (chuckles) I don't need help. I'm free. You can be free too. I can help you. I've done it before. - Done what? - Not everything I told you was a lie, Lacy. I've been more honest with you than I have anyone in my whole life. I felt I owed it to you since you'd been so honest with me. - What do you mean? - Your blog. That's how I found you. That's how I knew you'd know what I'd been through. See, when I told you my dad cheated, that was the truth. He found someone younger, prettier, sweeter. (laughs) Sweeter to him, maybe. She convinced him to leave my mom. She took her husband, took her home, she took everything. Almost everything. She let my mom take her own life. Once my mom was out of the way, there was only one thing standing in between her and the perfect life that she had planned. - You. - She threw me out of the house, convinced my dad they could start a whole life together without me. Well, turns out it's pretty hard to do that when you're dead. - You killed her? - He decided that he didn't want me. He didn't want my mom. So I decided he wouldn't have anyone. - I'm sorry. - We don't do sorry, remember? I knew when I found out that your dad cheated on your mom that I'd have to help you teach him the same lesson that I taught mine. - What are you talking about? - I'm going to take away everything. You can come with me. Or. (shrieking) - Mom! (slow dramatic music) - Lacy? - Honey? (rattling door) - Lacy! (knocking) (grunting) (screaming) Call the police. Lacy! (grunting) (dramatic music) (knife clatters) (screaming) (clattering bag) (grunting) (thumping door) (sighs) (grunting) (door rattling) (grunts) (thumps door) Lacy! Sweetheart, sweetheart, are you okay? Come on. (dramatic music) (body thumps) (slow dramatic music) (grunts) - Yes, I need the police. We have an intruder. Oh my God. I'm gonna need an ambulance right away to 1210 Chestnut Avenue. (screaming) (slow dramatic music) (shrieking) (grunting) (slow dramatic music) (labored breathing) Lacy? (slow dramatic music) (switch clicks) Lacy? Lacy? (door thumps) (slow dramatic music) (water trickling) (slow dramatic music) Lacy. Lacy? Lacy? (slow dramatic music) (shrieking) (grunting) - She deserves someone who cares about her. She deserves somebody who won't leave her. - No! (screams) (glass shatters) (labored breathing) (slow dramatic music) - Mom, - Honey. - Mom. - Honey. (muffled talking) Are you okay? - [Lacy] Where's dad? - He's in your room. (running footsteps) Oh David. Honey, call for help. (shrieks) - Ambulance is out front. Where is she? - Down the hall in my bedroom. - Dad. (slow dramatic music) (cheerful music) (camera clicking) (laughs) - [Hope] You look beautiful. - (laughing) How many pictures do you need, mom? - Well it's not everyday your daughter graduates from high school. You're beautiful. - Love you. (knocking on door) Hm. Well if it isn't our very own valedictorian. - Stop. - Hi. - Hi. (laughing) - Wait, wait. - Yay! You look so good. - [Harper] Thank you, so do you. - [Lacy] Thanks. (talking over one another. - And the photos. (laughing) Harper. (laughing) So smart. - [Lacy] Okay, mom. - Okay, okay you're right, we should get going. - I want that. - Okay. Well you shoulda done better on your tests. - [Lacy] Oh! (laughs) - [Hope] David. - [Lacy] Dad. (laughing) - Sweetheart. Gosh, look at you. - Mmhmm, I did it. (sighs) - I thought we were meeting at the ceremony. - Yeah, I thought that maybe we could go as, I don't know, a family? If it's okay with you guys. - I think that would be nice. - Yeah, okay. - All right, let's do it. - Come on. (laughs) - How's the job? - It's good. - Yeah? - Yeah, I'm working half time for the summer so I can spend more time with Lacy before she's off to college. - Oh that's great. - (sighs) Girls, one more. Aw. Lace, let me get one of you and your dad. - Actually, could we get all three of us? Harper? - Yeah, of course. - [Hope] Thanks Harper. - Okay, ready? - Come here, ma. (laughing) - [Harper] Ready guys? Smile. Cute. (gentle cheerful music) (slow dramatic music) (distant people chatting) - Sorry. Maybe you could show me around. It's my first day. (slow dramatic music)
