The latest confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Belgium: 1,384 new cases today. A total of 15,348 infections have been confirmed throughout the country. Of the 1,384 new patients, 912 are in Flanders, 137 in Brussels... This cat's not taking the lockdown very seriously! Come on. Lockdown for everyone. Ready? Ready. 183 recorded deaths in the last 24 hours. The threshold of 1000 deaths has now been reached. I should leave my mask on. You never know. I should take my cap off. Yeah. I'm not taking my top off. No way! 10 centimetres to your right, Fabio. To my right? 5 centimetres to your left. Careful, because in Italy this is 20 centimetres! People are required to stay at home and avoid contact with anyone other than close family. [ERASMUS HOSPITAL, BRUSSELS 7 DAYS INTO LOCKDOWN] Are you OK, sir? Are you OK? Yes, I'm fine. We’re waiting for a porter to come and get you now. Will I be put in isolation? Yes, you're in the COVID-19 unit. Can my family visit me? No. Visits aren’t allowed. None? No visits. The patients we see coming in here have difficulty breathing they feel like they're drowning in their own phlegm they shiver constantly, they hurt all over, and their lungs feel like they’re burning. And we don't know how to relieve them we give them treatments but we're still not sure they work. Hello sir, how are you? I'm OK. Could be better. This is a specialised unit so you’re not allowed to leave the room. You can take your mask off when no one’s around, but you must wear it if a nurse comes in to treat you. OK? Tomorrow, we’ll explain your test results, to get you home as soon as possible. That’s what everybody wants. That’s what everybody wants. Yes. Good night. Hang in there. Thank you. You’re welcome. It’s up to you. You can wait here or ring the bell… I don’t know if she’ll come out right away. It depends on what they say. That’s fine. She has her phone in case she rings. Right. Thank you very much! You’re welcome. Patients aren’t allowed any visitors, they’re only allowed to phone their families. So they feel very alone. And when we enter the room, we’re not family, we’re nurses so that’s one barrier, and then all the gear creates a second barrier. So she says to me… What did she say? She wakes up and says to me: "It’ll never work with that big butt of yours". Normally, we’d wear it front-ways with some tape, but we’re actually well protected here so… Don’t you have any normal gowns left? No. Because prices have shot up around the world. The price of gowns? The price of gowns. So we have to make do with these for now. We ordered some but they never arrived. We don’t know where they are. At least we’re protected. At least we’re protected, well yeah. We wear uncomfortable face shields, a so-called mask, a cotton gown, and we tape up our wrists. So we get very hot when treating patients. But what worries me the most is the contact we have with the patients. Patients see us arrive wearing a gown, gloves and a face shield. It must be traumatising for them too. As carers we have to protect ourselves. But patients who are sick in bed and weak see nurses arrive wearing these space suits. It’s tough for them too. How are you? I’m feeling a bit better. You're feeling a bit better? Be brave. You’re doing really well. Camille, can you get me a sheet and two bed pads? Let’s change everything. A sheet and two bed pads? Yes. Madame, your gown. There you go. Is that OK? Breakfast is on its way. Now I’ve lost the end. It’s all a bit complicated, isn’t it! I don’t look like a nurse, I look like a butcher. A fat butcher. Wow, I can’t breathe under all of this. We used to have much thicker aprons but now that we’ve run out of gear, we have to wear this which is very thin and tears very easily so to protect ourselves we wear these butcher’s aprons too. This is Europe after all. We live in a country with highly sophisticated and world-renowned hospitals. Yet here we are without any equipment. As health care workers we didn’t feel safe. They’d already squeezed the health system but this is too much because they squeezed the system without providing any backup. So, not only are we left to face a huge health crisis without any equipment the government has no idea how to run anything. Let’s find something. Ah, that’s a good one. The job of a coronavirus ICU consultant is actually quite monothematic. At first it was: “how can we oxygenate this patient’s blood?" because, as you know, our bodies can’t survive without oxygen. And the whole world was saying that it’s a lung disease, it affects the lungs. In the most severe cases, the patient is put to sleep, a tube is inserted into the airways and the machine – the artificial respirator as we call it – forces air and oxygen into the patient’s lungs. Are they here? We think he still has a good chance and that we should try this because we’re not sure he’ll make it otherwise. So, really, hang in there. Yes. Here, Fabio. Yes? Is my ear covered? Yes. It’s very thin. Yes, I know but with gloves on you can’t feel anything. It looks good, really DIY. What did you say? It looks a bit DIY. Let me take my gloves off. It’s like a sauna! We’ll give him a cannula, like a femoral ECMO, into the left subclavian rather than the jugular that way it’ll go in straight, in the vessel’s direction, without the curvature you have in the... The idea is to have the least pressure possible to avoid... 14, you see. It’s only just functioning with the machine. Ready, Zoé? Yes. We’ll have to check if the machine is OK for here. Wait another 5 minutes. Seriously, the French are always so slow. Quick, I need gauze, please. As soon as we’ve inserted the cannula, we’ll administer a heparin bolus. All OK? After a while we noticed that some of these patients were developing complications in other organs. It’s a disease that can affect the entire body. Jérôme! Operating theatre in half an hour. OK. Operating theatre in half an hour. And we can stop the heparin now. OK. I’d like a stretcher though. We’ve gone to get one already and some oxygen for the ECHO. If the machine were to play up now, he’d die instantly. Nothing enters the thorax, nothing. Do we have to go get the bed? No, they’ll bring it. They’ve put a tiny bit… Ask the anaesthetist to bring the table. The anaesthetist is here. Because there’s no lung left, and he has a PAO2 ratio of 67. There’s nothing in his lungs, nothing. The second week was a nightmare because none of our patients were doing well, no one was getting better. We had the impression that more and more patients were arriving, all with the same thing. No one was doing well. As a doctor, this inability to find solutions to these patients’ medical problems was very hard. There’s a problem in terms of the pressure. What’s going on? The pressure, where’s the pressure? I’ve cut it, it’s done. I’m ready. What was really unusual was seeing so many seriously ill people all with the same virus arrive at the hospital all at once and within a very short period of time. Meryem. Yes. Oh! How are you? I don’t know if you’ve heard but we’re going to be neighbours again. That’s what I heard. Unfortunately, you’re the last team that’s still open… Exactly. And cores were created. Absolutely, you’ve got it. So it’s true that it would be good... All the technical nurses were sent here. Yes. You know, boosted with 3 weeks’ worth of experience. That’s it, exactly. Hey, it’s not much but it’s a start! We had to open special COVID-19 units in a hurry. We opened the first COVID-19 unit on the 7th floor. Then a second COVID-19 unit was opened. Then, with the influx of patients and an increase in the number of recorded cases we had to deal with an influx of ER patients so we opened a third COVID-19 unit and finally a fourth one. It’s very tricky because things can change from hour to hour. We’re doing the move today. Basically, we’ll be moving the unit as it is down to the fourth floor. So we’re moving towards something more positive: the rehabilitation of patients coming out of ICU. There probably won’t be tons of them, we’re expecting that, but there will be some. Maybe this will just help send a message of hope that we’ll be helping these people recover rather than die. So I think it’s a great project. Let Maggie De Block release the money. Give us some money for this. Shame on her! I am angry, we are angry! It’s shameful! Shameful! Where are the millions they promised us? Where is the equipment? Where is it? No, I’m angry! OK, so you’re angry, but think of the patients, OK? Yes. Well yes. We can talk but… Express yourself by all means, but… Anyway. Careful, careful. So here, these patients are end-of-life, end-of-life, and end-of-life. Three end-of-life patients. Three-end-of-life patients, here, here and there. Good morning. It’s fine, I can get through. All good? Yes. Thank you. What floor? Four. Who are you taking? [inaudible name] Yes. And where’s he going? I don’t know. It’s a race. Well, there’s work to be done. You have to be coordinated, organised, combine forces, but I don’t see myself as a soldier. It’s completely different. Soldiers go to war and kill people, we’re here to look after them. You don’t have to be a soldier to be organised. So you’re not at war like Macron? Not at all. No, not at all. Sure, we’re experiencing a health crisis, but we’re not at war. This has to stop. Got to see things for what they really are. "We are at war", it’s ridiculous. We’re inside. There we go. Can you see? Yes. The thing she has on her head measures her state of consciousness. They’re just stickers, it’s nothing. The catheter in her nose is to feed her, and the tube in her mouth helps her breathe. She seems tired. She has lines. Her face is really… she seems tired. She’s spent several days lying face-down which leaves marks on the face. All that is normal, well… normal. Yes, yes. OK. It looks like she’s been working hard. She kind of has been. She’s fighting a huge battle, so it’s not surprising she looks tired. We’re going to leave her on her back today. We lay her on her front to help the lungs but we don’t need to do that now. So things are a bit better. I can’t say we’re out of the woods yet, but we’re slightly more optimistic. Let me show you the photos we’ve put up. Look. Ah that’s good, there’s one of everybody, that’s great. We put everything we were sent up. Oh that’s good. Honestly, thank you so very much. That will make her happy when she wakes up again. Yes, absolutely. Honestly, thank you so much for everything. We’re doing all we can, you know that. I know, I know, we can see that. We can see that. I didn’t realise how generous human beings could be. To have such empathy and kindness, but also… from a professional. I imagine it’s very hard for them too. They know full well that at that moment they are the only link. So they have to look strong to help us keep going. We washed a patient’s body after they’d died and… we had to close this horrible white body bag. That’s when you realise the patient has been here alone, has died alone, will be buried alone and we’ve just closed a plastic bag. That’s really hard. To be honest it’s… Anyway! People who are convinced this coronavirus is not fatal say: "yes, but the patient died of something else". But, thankfully, diabetics don’t die from one day to the next. People with high blood pressure don’t die from one day to the next. 30 to 40 % of the patients we have in intensive care, for flu too, have other illnesses. You might suffer from a chronic illness, but it won’t kill you overnight. So I really don’t understand why people try to downplay an illness that has completely changed the way we live. Not just for doctors but the population as a whole. No other illness would have done that. What are we being called out on? COVID-19. COVID-19? Yes. Deterioration of a COVID-19 patient on the 4th floor, Peterbos. Peterbos? We are heading to Peterbos, can you confirm the building number, please? Number five, building number five. OK, roger. It’s this one. This one. OK, fine. Now, take the first right. I think it’s here. It’s here, right? Oxygen, guys. Yes, I got it. Hi, what floor? 11th floor. 11th? 11th, first door on the right. Is it the 14th? No, there is no 14th, it’s labelled 11, I think. Anyway, there are only 5 doors. Yes? Yes? Did you call for an ambulance? No. OK, fine. This is the 11th floor. Where? Here, right here. Ah there we go. The doctor will go in with the nurse. We’ll wait outside. Is he alone at home? Is he in lockdown alone? Yes. How long for? Ever since he got back from the hospital. How many days? Must be a week by now. A week. Did they test him here? Yes, they told him he was positive and to stay home. He can’t stay home like this. It’s not ideal. It’s impossible. As soon as he doesn’t feel well, he needs to be cared for and treated. But if they’re overwhelmed at the hospital, is it worth putting him in an ambulance that has had COVID-19 or going if they won’t have time to look after him? The doctor’s calling the hospital to see. That’s it. Are we going to the hospital? We’re going to the hospital. I was here two weeks ago with a Critical Care Ambulance for something else and there were loads of people in the park. I said: We’ll be back to collect COVID-19 patients. And here we are. 1, 2, 3, that’s it. Lift. Saturation level is 92, plus a good curve. Let’s add some. How much oxygen do you want? Two litres. Aurélie, 2 litres of oxygen. It’s not disastrous but... We won’t be able to visit him or anything? If Bracob is like our hospital, then no. Normally, no. You’ll just have to see over the next few days. I don’t want to give you any false reassurances or alarm you unnecessarily so, you’ll see in the next few days. But have you already seen cases like my father’s? Ah, a lot people who like him… Who later don’t need oxygen anymore? Yes, they get back to normal. But some cases can be more complicated. There are risk factors, things like that but... anyway. It's OK, so... In any case, thank you. Hang in there. Goodbye. Do you like this? Yes, I do! You don’t mind it? No, on the contrary. Heading back to base now. We were in Peterbos two weeks ago in a Critical Care Ambulance there were loads of people, it felt more like a holiday than a lockdown. But if you see it from the point of view of people who’ve been in lockdown 24/7 for over a month who have no balcony, no garden and no other way of getting 5 minutes of fresh air well, yes, I do understand why they’re outside. But if you look at what’s going on, they must realise that people are sadly dying. Yes, but it’s not the same, you and me realise that because we’re here, we see them die every day. When we’re on call we think: we can’t save them, they can’t be brought back because it’s too late. The average person with no means, who lives in a 40-square-metre apartment with 3 or 4 kids, they can’t get outside. They have no choice but to go to the park to let their kids breathe a bit, so it’s complicated. Yes, but that’s what we’re saying. Our government has no credibility in terms of the general population of this country. All they care about is the well-being of a small minority, and that’s the problem. Yesterday, I went to drop the baby off at Saint-Pierre, what was happening? There we were, the cops were there but everybody was crowded onto the pavements. 200 people crammed onto the pavements, but what can you do? We’ve just come from Saint-Pierre, same thing. There we go. No one wearing a mask or any protection loads of people around, everybody there together and… If one person is sick, they will infect another 200 people. And of those 200 people, I doubt any have gained immunity so that means even more transmissions. And these people won’t have symptoms for another two weeks. Yes, the numbers look good now but later on… Maybe even longer. Yeah, they'll go out and infect other people. That’s what’s difficult for people to understand: that today’s actions have consequences for later. Well, yes. Have you had to tell friends off? Oh yes, every day. And family members, too. Because they just don’t realise. They phone us, they encourage us, the general public encourages us by clapping for us every day it’s all very well but it’s annoying. "I really felt the humanity that you put into your work despite the fatigue and the stress of this pandemic. So I will clap for you tonight, and every other night." There. That was a short message I received and wanted to pass on to you because it’s important too. I’d never stop anyone from clapping, it’s really nice, it’s great, plus it gives the district a great atmosphere. My children love it because they clap for Mum. But I’m no hero. Well… I do my job, I try to do my job well, but that doesn’t make us heroes. Basically, why now? Why now and not before? We’ve always cared for people. I’ve cared for lots of couples who couldn’t have children, but later went on to have them. My colleagues have cared for grandmothers, grandfathers, fathers, sons, children and… why now? Because we’re caring for exactly the same people, except they have a virus that came from God knows where. But otherwise we’ve always worked like this. And now it’s: "oh yeah, nurses exist". Camilla? Can you go see the lady and check that the Babyphone works? Camilla, can you hear me? No. Hello. No. Oh yes, here. Hello. Can you hear me now? Yes. There we go. Can you hear me? I can hear you loud and clear. One-two-one-two. Bitata hulwa. Yeah, great. We can hear you really well. We can hear really well. Bitata hulwa, what does that mean? You shouldn’t know that. No, it’s nothing mean. It means sweet potato. Camilla, the cameraman just asked [me:] what does Bitata hulwa mean? Sweet potato, sugary potato. Who is sweet potato, you or Meryem? Both of us. We’re a couple of giant sweet potatoes. She’s unbelievable! So it works. Camilla? Oh no... Madame? Yes? Are you doing OK? Sorry? Are you doing OK? Yes. Isn’t this walkie-talkie great? See you later then. Erasmus Hospital really is quite multicultural, quite cosmopolitan. I’m of Moroccan heritage, I speak some Moroccan. My colleague is Congolese, she speaks some Lingala. I have an Italian colleague, we try to speak to her in Italian. This mix of cultures is very rewarding. Whether it’s nurses, doctors, or the technical team, Erasmus Hospital employees all mix together. Do you want to double-bag it or are you OK? Can you find me one? Yes, I’ll find you some. Otherwise here. Hold on, let me put some gloves on. Put it down. Will you help me carry the second of these two yellow bags down? Thanks Agathe. Put it down here. I have four trolleys. Isn’t this room dangerous? Yes, like this it is. Aren’t you afraid? I have no choice. You see, I have no choice. What do you mean you have no choice? Why don’t I have a choice? I have no choice. I have to work. Hello Mohamed, how are you? Yes. All fine? Right, I’m going to eat. You want to join me? Sure. Let’s see what we have left. Since COVID-19 started the hospital has been giving us food. So we eat fish every day. Ev-er-y-day! I don’t eat meat, you see. I’m kind of vegetarian but I eat fish. Well, we eat fish every day. I like it but... it’s not Mama’s couscous. Madame, no, no, no, no. Back we go, come on. Let’s get back to your room. Come on. Let’s get you some tea. What do you say to that? Come on. Sit down. Let me bring you some tea, alright? No sugar, perfect! Can you put your gloves on? Would you mind giving it to her? Thank you Fara. It’s for the lady who’s right next door. Perfect. Is there any cutlery for me? Looks like we've run out. Haven’t you eaten yet? I’ve not had time. Oh, oh, oh. Look who’s here. Bernadette. Did you drink your tea? Was it good? Or was there not enough sugar? There, back to your room. Well done. No, we just want you to wait in your room for a short while, until all your results come back. And then we’ll tell you when you can go home. Are you alright? Where are you going? I’ll stand by the door so she doesn’t escape. My colleague will give her some drops to calm her down. That’ll give me time to get dressed at least. Thank you. I’ll come with you. You’re in bed, great! We just want to check that everything's OK before sending you home. There we go. Let’s warm it up again. I’ve ended up eating alone. You see, I’m going to eat alone. Everybody else has already eaten. So, it’s fish for the tenth time. She wanted to escape. What? Through the window. Who found her? Her neighbour rang. Oh boy, lucky she’s all there. Who found her? Her neighbour. Both legs? It’s lucky her neighbour was… otherwise… They wanted to isolate her, but let’s leave the neighbour with her. COVID-19 began, we’re all in a health crisis, we all know that there was a beginning but there's no end in sight. You might be determined, you might be here, you might try to cope, but at some point, the teams will get tired stress is exhausting, the fact that we’re always in the hospital is not easy. That’s really it, it’s the uncertainty that weighs on us all. We don’t know where we’re headed and that’s hard. The work we do involves patients dying but most do pull through. So we’re more used to winning. The difficulty here is that there are a lot of defeats and failures, in that we’re not seeing patients improve. And that’s very frustrating for the team. No stress. Trust us. You are not alone, even if your family is far. There are a lot of us around you here. We’re not always in the room with you but we’re just behind that door. Squeeze my hand if you understand. Squeeze my hand. He’s not squeezing my hand. He’s not doing it. He did it earlier. Squeeze. Ah, there. Ah! That’s it. That’s it. 22 days. -22 days on the ventilator. -Yes. How long since he last saw her? Since he got here? 29th March. That’ll be a wonderful moment. Sure. His wife doesn’t know he’s been extubated? She kind of asked me… I had to say yes. OK, she knows. So it won’t be a surprise. No, I wanted to… but anyway. That’s fine. I couldn’t lie to her and say no. I understand. My colleague Sabina. Don’t worry, she looks a bit scary! She’s courageous. She’s entering the room. Mr [xxxx]. No panic. She can see you, wave to her. We’ve just taken his tube out. She says that her and the kids think about him all the time. Her and your children think about you all the time, OK? Alright? While I was in the coma, I had a lot of nightmares. Always about death. Everybody around me was dead. People I didn’t know. I was the only one fighting. I can see myself fighting. Always. Death, death and me fighting. In different contexts and different places. Once in a cold country. Another time in Spain. But I was always fighting death. And I was always surrounded by lots of dead people. Lots of people who had died. I was afraid to fall asleep. Afraid of falling asleep, back into my nightmares. I didn’t want to. I didn’t want to. Because, of course, dreams feel real. I couldn’t take it anymore. Have you seen the film Saw? That’s kind of what it feels like. You wake up in a place you don’t know and it feels like you’re being tortured. If, on top of that, there is no one you know there, no one you recognise you are suffering alone with these people you don’t know. That’s terrible. I don’t know if that contributes to a patient's death or mortality, but it has major psychological consequences and sometimes impacts our ability to treat them during their time in intensive care. And even in hospital, a lot of patients who go upstairs or who are hospitalised with less severe forms but who are isolated from the whole world with no contact with their families sure you can speak on the phone, that can also have a major impact on their desire to fight. Hi kids. Hi kids. They can’t hear me! Wait, we’ll speak again. Hi kids! Hello darlings! It’s Mum. How are you, darlings? Adam, how are you? Yes? What’s he doing? He’s working. Hello sweetheart, how are you? I’ve disturbed them, poor things. Mum! Mum! Hello sweetheart. Mum can see you, but you can’t see me. Are they looking into the camera? Yes. She can see us but you can’t see her. See you later, darlings. Who’s looking after them right now? The eldest, my 13-year-old is looking after them. I cook the day before, put it in the fridge and my daughter reheats the food or when my husband has time, he comes home at midday to feed them. They’ve been alone in the house for two months. We leave them very early in the morning and come back late at night. We have three cameras. Do you call them often? Three times a day: when I get to work, at midday and in the evening before heading home. Is it hard not seeing them so often? Does it weigh on you? Very much. Very, very much because I’m a very possessive mother. I love to look after my children. I am very close to them. And the fact they see me less, weighs on them too. Yesterday my 10-year-old had a bit of a tantrum, not out of jealously, but saying: "Mum, we exist too. It’s not all about work." So I want to finish things here and spend a few days with them, try to reconnect. It’s complicated. Hello! Goodbye! Goodbye. Goodbye! Thank you for everything! Let’s hope we don’t see you again! Saving lives is the reason we do our job, despite everything. When a patient comes to visit us afterwards, when they’re back on their feet, and says: Doctor, I lived thanks to you, thanks to the team, and I’m doing really well, I’m doing this. For us, that’s the greatest encouragement to keep doing what we do. It’s a relief. Yes, I can imagine. Were you conscious throughout? Yes. I kept my head even if I was disoriented at times. Here we are, number 705, with a window. Wonderful. Sold! Here we are. But I won’t stay till Christmas. Well I hope not, for your sake! A sink and a toilet, what luxury! There you have to use a bedpan. I must admit, it’s not something I would recommend to anyone. Let’s just say it’s an experience. What are you thinking when you move floors? That you were lucky? Yes. Because that’s not the case for everyone. I spoke to the nursing staff in intensive care. In the unit I was in there were 27 patients. Of those 27, two were talking because they were still able to, the other 25 were intubated. Of those two, I’ve made it, I’ve moved up here and will probably be able to go home in a few days. I’ve managed the impossible. To experience it from the outside, is one thing. But when you are directly impacted, in the flesh, and all you hear is the number of cases, the number of deaths, and all that. Wow, and you’re telling yourself that you’re next in line. The morning they told me I was to be intubated and induced into coma for a fortnight, wow. I didn’t get the chance to say goodbye to my family. When I came here to do the test at the entrance, we simply said goodbye and I’ll tell you whatever depending on the test result. I didn’t see anybody again. So if things had gone wrong, that’s where it would have been left. Yes, hello, Maryse Degand, senior nurse from COVID A. I’m calling because I have symptoms. I have a sore throat, a cough and I lost my sense of taste this morning. That’s it. I don’t have much of a temperature. OK. So I have to go through admissions. Yes. OK. Externally then. OK, fine, thank you. Right, I have to do a nasal swab. Listen, I figured it was bound to happen at some point. Hello Mohamed. How are you? Fine, and you? When do you think you’ll get the results? In two days. Do you have any symptoms? Yes. Let’s go. Hang in there, don’t move your head back, I know it’s hard. I know it’s hard. This gives us the best chance of success. Yes, I understand, I understand. Eight, nine, ten, that’s it, I’m removing it now. Hang in there. Are you OK? Yes. I realise it’s not pleasant, really not. It’s got to be done right otherwise there’s no point. The aim is to… I know, I know. That looked hard. Honestly, I wasn’t expecting that. I didn’t expect it to take so long. Oh my, we’ve come out the other side now. Let's see in two days. Yes. You see, I’m coughing quite a bit. Sounds bad. But it’s a loose cough, a COVID-19 cough is usually dry. It’s true, a COVID-19 cough is dry. Yes. I have a loose cough so it can’t be COVID-19. Look, I’ve just changed and I’m drenched again. 35°2. It’s just that I didn’t do it properly, but I think it’s because I’m irritated. I’m sure I’ve got sinusitis. You’re in total denial. I’m sorry to have to leave you like this, guys, but I’ll get better soon. Might be us next. Yes. Here you go, I made them in the last couple of days. I tried them on so wash them at 60°. Yes, I'll do that. Kisses! Hang in there. Take care. You too. Meryem. I’m off now, darling. In any case, we’ll keep in touch. Rest up. Kisses. Yes, kisses. Oh I’m being silly now. Anyway. I’m emotional about leaving. Of course. I'm being silly. At first, I was very scared, coming out of the COVID-19 units. I’d say to myself, I hope I don’t give it to my husband or my children. But I am extremely cautious. So I tell myself that I’m very cautious here. I’ll probably go to a supermarket, pick up a bag of crisps and get COVID-19 that way. All in all, I’ve done everything I can to protect myself. And that’s it, it’s fate if anything happens, there’s nothing else I can do. Put your gloves on. I’ll speak to him first. Yes. It’ll be OK. You want me to call a psychologist? Hi, this is Meryem from COVID E. We have a patient who has tested positive for COVID-19 and his son has just called to tell him his wife has died. Give me your hand. The news I have to tell you is not good. OK? This is not easy. And I understand your situation. We’re here and I’m going to pass your son over. That way you can talk to him too. OK? 82 years old. Yes. Take the telephone, you can speak in here. Hello. He wanted to tell him. He insisted over the phone. Yes. Yes. Listen, that's it. But I’d like to call the son first, and see with him, and then go see the gentleman. As soon as possible. I can’t kiss you, but I give you a big hug. OK? I’m holding you very tight. OK? Everything OK, Kaouthar? Your son said she was really fine. OK? OK. I’ll be right back. You alright? That was really hard. It was really hard because this gentleman will never see his wife again. And for us it was hard because we come from different backgrounds, different cultures, different religions. But whatever the religion or culture, you don’t die alone. So he almost felt, well, he said: I've abandoned my wife. Honestly, it was incredibly sad. And it’s situations like these that are problematic with this COVID-19 thing. Good evening, it’s Fabio Taccone from Erasmus Hospital. I’m calling you back because, as my colleague explained earlier today, the situation is pretty bad. Despite all the treatments we’re giving him, we can see his condition is getting worse. None of his organs are functioning anymore. It’s not just the lungs, but the kidneys, the liver and his blood pressure is getting harder and harder to control. So there is a good chance that he will die. So I’m contacting you because, despite the hospital being closed, in such situations, well… we can of course allow family members to sit with the patient. So if you would like to do that, perhaps you should come to the hospital now because, the way I see things going, I’m not sure how long your husband can hold on for. You can come with your son, of course. OK. See you soon. Goodbye. Yes, good evening, it’s Fabio Taccone from ICU. It will be the gentleman’s wife and son, and she asked me to have the priest come because I think she realises the hour is near. Are they here? In the small lounge. Should I join them in there? Yes, if that’s OK with you? Sure. Go ahead. Good evening. I’m the doctor on duty tonight. I know your husband well because I was here from the very beginning. Unfortunately the situation has become complicated over the last 48 hours. As I told you on the phone. Since getting his infection at the hospital because he’s been on a ventilator for almost a month now. We’ve been giving him drugs to keep him alive. But no matter what we do he’s gradually getting worse. That’s why I called you: his condition is deteriorating so rapidly that I think he will die tonight. When the family comes in to the hospital and they see their loved one a month after they’ve been hospitalised on the day we announce they are going to die... It’s hard, because you mustn’t only explain what’s going on you also have to explain in what state they'll find them in and… It's a bit of a shock when you enter the room. The situation was such that I didn’t want the gentleman to die alone, without his family. So I asked them to come in now. Are you going to stick around a bit longer? Yes. Yes? That’s good. So motivated, I’m happy. It was one of the most difficult things to accept on a human level. We had a long meeting at the beginning because some hospitals, not just in Belgium but in other countries too, after coronavirus hit, they closed them and refused to allow families to visit even after the patient had died. Because, obviously, whoever lives with someone who has the coronavirus will probably also have it, so they can’t be allowed into the hospital because of the risk of them bringing the virus with them. And we looked at each other in the eye and said to ourselves, we can’t do that. It’s inhumane. Plus this is the Free University of Brussels, with its open-mindedness and all that, we couldn’t allow these patients to remain alone in their suffering and prevent their families from seeing their loved ones in their dying moments. Do you think we can go in? I’m here. Would you like me to come in, is that better? We don't want you to stop the breathing aid. So he can go naturally. If he has to go. Because... we believe in life. You know, medicine is medicine. And the end of a life is the end of a life. The end of a person’s life can happen in various ways and if you'd like it to happen as naturally as possible then we’ll try to make sure it happens as naturally as possible. That’s no problem. We know you did your job and did everything you could. Now it is time for the expression of our faith. All we ask is for you not to turn the machines off. No problem. Thank you very much. It’s as if we were doing this with a Muslim, you see, who accepts the fact that it’s time. I don’t know how it’s going to work, if I’m not here, you tell them that the funeral is in three days. Right. Any other questions? No. It’s fine. Finished, finished, finished. Bedtime. Good night! Are they going to film you as you sleep? Yes, with infrared. Wearing your pyjamas? No. My gold bathrobe. Hello? Hi Maryse, it’s Robin the cameraman. How are you? Yes, I’m fine, and you? I’m calling to get some news. First, to see if you’ve had your test results. Yes, absolutely. The very same day, that evening, I got a phone call to say I was in fact positive. So it wasn’t sinusitis. No, not at all, it was COVID-19. I feel very tired. I get myalgia, pain in my muscles and as soon as I get up, well… I’m out of breath, my heart races. But if it goes on like this... At the same time, I’m in good hands. At worst, if it should deteriorate, I know what I have to do. I’ll take good care of myself and when I’m myself again, I’ll have to go back to get this done because we’re not finished yet. We’ve still got some way to go. My mother always says that as a child of God, death is a gain. God gives and God takes away. We know where Dad is now. We now have only two COVID-19 patients left in this last intensive care unit which was the first to open and will be the last to close. So these are the last two patients. One patient who will be moving back up this week and a last one who is on a ventilator and in a slightly more serious condition. But he’s the last one. So this whole unit, that is dedicated to treating COVID-19 patients, has slowly emptied out because, thankfully, the last patients who arrived here have all gone up to the recovery floor after having recovered from the illness. Even patients who were so sick they needed ventilators we managed to get them off these machines and move them upstairs. So even the most serious cases. We are seeing the end of the epidemic. Some were here a long time but we managed to treat all their complications. We had a series of patients who made good and fast progress. It was very important for the team. Because as I was saying, at the beginning, the first two weeks were terrible: no one was doing well. After a while, we saw these people gradually improve. So… let me show you a video I was sent that really made me laugh. Franco, watch out, you’re being filmed. I’m immortalising the moment. You want us to applaud you? First steps! That’s great, Franco. Wonderful! I watched it and it really makes me laugh. It’s the music from Rocky. Wonderful! That to the virus! Wonderful. Ah yeah, it’s wonderful. I saw that video, it was emotional but funny too, because he was returning home. Over two and a half, three weeks, he went from ICU to hospital, to another hospital, then rehab and home. Incredible. It's in these moments that you tell yourself that, on balance, we don’t do such a bad job. Girls, have you got a minute for a photo? To mark the closing of the department. I had to lead a team I didn't know. I had to provide care, I hadn't provided in twelve years. I had to look for new structures. That made me rediscover a potential, I had forgotten. Come, Christelle, let’s take a photo to mark the last day of the Covid E department. The nurses diagnose, they know which treatment to give, they know why and they know how. Being a nurse is more then a vocation, it's a profession. I can't stress that enough. Because a lot of people still believe we voluntarilly sacrifice ourselves. But no, it's our job. Stand over there, against the light. You’ve got to squeeze in. Squeeze in! Is anyone still here? Ready? Say cheese. Say Covid E goodbye. I’m going to miss you all. Are you still looking forward to returning to your normal duties? Off course. I think we are all looking foreward to going back to normal.
