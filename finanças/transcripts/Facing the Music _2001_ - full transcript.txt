I'll take a number of shots, so in case we get people blinking and so on. Ready, one, two, three. - Oh I didn't consult with you, I just wrote down yes. - Oh, of course, yes. - Yes. - Well, he's a yes isn't he? Definitely. - Oh, incredible. - Oh yes, he's fantastic. - Yeah. - We'd like to admit the following applicants to the B-A-B Mas degree, Kenny Alexis, Khoo Joanne, Lim Katherine, Orzarski Anna. - I just think the timing is appalling, but I think striking I mean God, we're a community of academics, if we can't think of something more dignified to do than a strike then I'm I mean I think we should all just give up and I think the business of striking on salaries anyway is terribly tacky. And again we're a community of scholars one hopes and we're here not because we expect to be paid well, but because we love what we do. - My friends think I'm mad to pursue a career in academia. They all say I could be making so much money elsewhere. That's one of the reason I'm so keen to take action and you know I hate to play that kind of youth card, but I just want to know whether some people realise just how difficult it is these days, it was brought up in the meeting the other week to countenance this career and the whole joint will just fall to bits because no one will want to work here with what we're facing. - Nonsense. - Well... - We love our discipline, that's why we work here... Yeah, that doesn't pay the rent in this town... We love our discipline. I'm sorry, on an associate lecturer's wage, you can barely afford you know it doesn't matter. Anyway that's why I'm here and that's why what we're fighting for is absolutely just. - Fundamentally you need to understand that the argument is with both the university management and the federal government. It is not an either or situation and it may be that if the federal government funded universities properly management would not have any difficulty in paying our salary climb because it is not a huge salary climb. - One of the most important things to consider is the students coming to university whether their gates are closed on that first day I think is an extraordinarily bad message to give to them. I... - I think it's a good message. Yes, it's the real world. We still want them here. They learn what their universities really go through. - I know there are a lot of staff who feel that way. It is a comment that should have been made weeks ago. - I just want to also register total support for Virginia's stand on this and this is the first time I've come to a union meeting, I have to confess. I came because I felt so horrified by the psychological damage that we may be causing to young people who are coming into this university for the first time, not kids who are in unis or who are already a bit savvy with the way in which universities operate, I think we're shooting ourselves in the foot and I think we're sending the wrong signs out into the community via these students. - I hate this characterization of undergraduate as scared little bunnies. - Yes. - That's absurd. I'm going to take a vote at this point, that in view of there being no further progress on the legitimate industrial claims of the members that a 24-hour strike be called next Monday, those in favor please raise your hand. Those against. That is carried. - What are you going to do, you're going to come in on Monday? - I shall be here. - Yes, well I will too. And you know I'll cross the picket line if I have to. ♪ Thereafter when I come to hold ♪ Here. Two and no just get the notes down. Three, one, two. - All of the main entrances are picketed, kindly turn around. - There's a strike today, kindly listen to what I say before you go inside, you're crossing a picket line, could you listen to what I say? There's a strike today, right by the general staff, if you cross this picket line you're letting down the union and letting yourselves down. - It's not all clear to me what it's all about really. This is a picket line mate. This is a picket line man. - Boo hoo, slash his tire. - Yeah. - The university is closed today. - Oh, all of it? - Yep. - Yay. - Yay. - Marvelous players, it's almost inconceivable that they can play so well together at this point because the tempo is so slow. To D major, you see a change of mood, you get that all through the late Beethoven quartets, these fantastic changes of mood. There's been a lot of pickets across the main campus, down at Mas road, I just got a call down they're going well down there. They weren't originally. - I'm Anne Boyd, professor of music in this department. I am a composer and that might influence the way in which I teach what is essentially a history of western music. Western artists are by their very nature subversive. They don't like theoretical constraints. As soon as there is something which stretches the imagination then the western artist will make an assault on the body of practice and try and see new patterns in the way in which things relate to each other and composers are no different from artists I suggest in all mediums than one might think of, hence this dynamic tradition, this tradition, which is subject to change. This doesn't happen in China. It does happen in the western world. It doesn't make one culture any better than the other. It simply makes them different and it's the difference that we're going to try and understand. Now mostly what artists do is a flop because theory evolves from successful practice and I think the practice has already preceded the theory. - This is the first variation. Second one. And there was one moment when Pachelbel just decided not to use this progression at all. It was right near the end, so the piece began and end, oh sorry, began and ended with a very beautiful melody over two planes of this space and that's called the aria or the air or the melody. - Now that's the scale that Beethoven uses in the beginning of his quarter, but it has a very nasty interval in it, on the fourth degree, it has this interval. And that the diabolus in musica, the devil in music, the tri tone a very dissonant out of tune sounding note. - The bad news I'm afraid is going to be compounded. We're going to end with a deficit of about 1.2 million and I don't think there's any possibility of us reducing that substantially let alone to nil in a year or even two or three years, but we've got to try and do something about it, because if it's simply added to next year by the same about, the faculty will have to go out of business in about three or four years. We've passed the days where it's like a credit card and that's I'm afraid there was a bit of culture like that it didn't matter if there was a deficit, because it was only on paper and it will be forgotten at the end of the year. - I don't really think it's true that the faculty has lived with a credit card mentality and was just spending out big. Since I've been here, the faculty has made constant efforts to live within its budget and has cut back consistently. There is a systemic fault in the way we are funded. I am pessimistic because I don't think we're going to get out of this spiral. - The quality has gone down. It's not a matter of blaming us. The money is not there to provide the quality that we should be providing, we know it, why do we go on with this rhetoric that we're the biggest, the best and so on? Because we've been trapped into it. We should be acknowledging that the quality is no longer there. - Everyone is aware that we need more money, but the one thing no one should feel is that there's some money in a Swiss bank account which fat man has access to. We are just going to have to do what we can with the money we've got. - There is no light at the end of the tunnel for the faculty and no magic wand that's going to come from the government. I'm anticipating a $40,000 deficit for the end of this year, which I think Chris will agree is pretty close to accurate. We have a $30,000 deficit which we incurred last year which is a carry forward so we're looking at a total deficit this year of about $70,000. I mean I think we've got to try and both raise some more money and we've got to try to save some money. - So it brings that 54 down to 45. - Okay, if we do that the 700, 800 there, I do those couple of tutes and we ask Ellen to do another set of tutes, that saves another couple of hundred dollars there. - Yes okay. - So we've saved $2,000 approximately $2,000 on that. - Okay, saved down there. This year we were given 39 and the year before we were given 46, right? By the time we pay for the photocopier, the postage, the stationary, tune the pianos once, it's all gone. So we can't even afford to tune our pianos. - Yeah, but what do I do? Do I say to staff okay you've each got five reams of paper, make do with this, I mean we can't run courses without batteries for the year, you know for the videos, batteries for the cameras, you know new strings for the violino right, all this stuff we cannot do the course without this kind of backup and where are the funds going to come from? I just don't know. Going through a lot of trouble in here? - Well I don't know what we can pull the plug on here. - Oh no, I can't, I can't see anything there that we can pull the plug on. - It's clear, you can say to the students look we've got a crisis, we can't do this... We can't. - The fact that the tenacity with which you try to hold on to every aspect of the department as it was I really do and many times I'm supporting you, but I do think every now and then in these you know when times are so difficult and strained by so many things, we must give a bit and this is an obvious area to give. It's a joke, a music department with no choir. - It's not a joke. - We can't do it. - It is a joke. - I mean it's unfortunate... - It is. - But there are so many other important things, you can't say that these choirs. - It's stretched every year our resources are reduced, we have to do more things I mean something has to go. - But you can't change anything unless you fight for what you believe in and I think too often we give in, we accept the status the new status quo, we accept too much. We're not fighting enough. - We all think that it's a failing that we don't have a choir, but we can't kill ourselves. Because if we just go on doing that, then everybody is going to get sick and the whole thing is gonna fall apart. - All I can see is a downgrade in the quality of the department and it's very, very hard to work, it's hard to do work, so hard for a department that's losing all its bits and pieces. Yeah it's terribly demoralising that we... The whole university is demoralised. - But seriously I dispute I really seriously dispute that the quality of this department has diminished. On the contrary, I think academically this department is shining. Oh hello Carly it's Anne Boyd calling. Oh not bad, Carly right to the point, I'm professor of music at the University of Sydney and we're in a situation at the moment where we're having to try and find some help outside the institution in financing parts of our curriculum and I'm turning to Commonwealth Bank's very first port of call in the hope that you might be able to sponsor some instrumental scholarships through the department. And I mean that Commonwealth Bank might like the idea of being associated with the music department. I mean we're a pretty good music department if I say so myself and the students who actually get these scholarships are really quite outstanding youngsters in many cases and I would have thought that could reflect very nicely in the bank's profile, Commonwealth Bank Music Scholars sort of has a nice ring to it I thought, yes, but you obviously the wrong person so I should put that all in writing should I to Brian? We would be prepared to negotiate an exclusive relationship with you. This would clearly have some suitable advantages in attracting vocal publicity to the bank, the bank. Quality music has always survived on quality patronage. It's this reason that the Commonwealth Bank is the first organization we are approaching. They should like that I mean the Commonwealth Bank is Australia's first bank, they should like that. - What we're proposing is a symbolic action that we will not cooperate with the university on its plan to celebrate its birthday and also indicating that we would have a stop work meeting organised for Thursday the 25th of March. - Is there any other business? I'll declare the meeting closed and the next meeting will be announced to you, thank you. Well-attended meeting wasn't it? - Sorry? - Quite well-attended meeting. I got into such trouble last time for turning up and talking against the strike because I hadn't been to many of the meetings... Oh, you were one of those. Yeah, yeah I better start coming so I'm backed if we strike again. - Our lease you know? - Yes. - 65,000 next year with a three year business degree from UTS you know in a bank. - Yes, yes, yes, yes. - She's already on 40 something on top of all the privileges, which means that they get shares, the reduced mortgage. - But that's fine because she's chosen to go in that direction, I've chosen... - No, I know but... - This is my temple... - At the same time... - This is my holy sanctum to me. - Yeah, I know but why should you I know I know. It's a religion, it's a spiritual calling. But it shouldn't be like this this days, you kind of expect young people to really to supervise a lot of things? - I mean if the church had said that... - Why would you want to be professor of economics here on 80,000 when you can be on 250,000 in a bank? - I can't strike Anisha I'm sorry, because I still regard teaching as a privilege, a calling and a privilege. - I haven't been able to do this section. I'm still working through it inside, but I want I want this to be more of a choral and I want this to be kind of be building up to it and a kind of a what Tavener does in Hymn to the Mother of God with the two choirs just I think at the distance of a couple of crotchets of a minimum doing exactly the same thing that kind of. - Mm-hmm, using an antigonal relationship between two groups, two singing groups? - Yeah. - Though hidden at times by the clouds of Adam's curse, you can actually do that with voices coming in one after the other after the other maybe even break down out of metrical texture all together at that point in the score and write that proportionately, do you know what I mean by that? - Yeah. - Hmm, that could be very magical. Your art, you've got the oboe though, but oh God, Keren just imagine that having the oboe and a solo voice... - Doing that... - Intertwined doing this almost as a playing song at the beginning and end of a composition. How magic would that be? Mixed with anticipation distance requires space to fill it. What is so fascinating about Monteverdi's music is that he stands right on the cusp of two periods and composers who do this are always the most interesting. Beethoven was one of the most interesting because he stood on the cusp of the classical and the romantic periods. In my view this is Bach getting very angry and Bach was a very stubborn old fellow in lots of ways I mean to the point where in one dispute with an employer, he was actually imprisoned for several months because he would not give ground on an issue and in this case one feels the voice of Bach protesting against the oppression of the individual. Okay order has come up again. Order is restored, order. Oh, it needs to be done, shit. B flat, major key already. - You've done very well there, if we cut that back by 30,000. - Yeah. - To the detriment of our students and our casual teachers who are very upset. - You mean the following stages? - The following stages yes. - Because of having so few lessons. - Well they're now they are in fact teaching the students as much as they did and now not getting paid for it because they will not see their standards go down and they will not see their students suffer. - Lessons, so they're giving more lessons than they're actually paying them for are they? Yes, a lot of them. Isn't that wonderful? - Yes it is Anne, but it's not fair. - F major. And the only reason F major can sound like that is because of the keys that went before it. Still hasn't gone home I see, I'm glad to see it. Great, a rehearsal in progress. Yes well Mr. Stravinsky and Keren's innocent. No, it came up my goodness they're rehearsing A Soldier's Tale, I know it's not the Soldier's Tale, there you are. - I haven't heard it before. - You don't know the Soldier's Tale? Ah well you have a treat in store. You've created a piece that has a family relationship to the Soldier's Tale, be very proud. That's another hangup with 20th century music. Everybody has this hangover for romanticism, everyone thinks you've got to write original music all the time. Nonsense, nonsense, utter nonsense. What you have to write is good music and music that works. I mean any of you try to write a piece like the Rite of Spring you won't be able to and in lecture you'd probably write a much better piece if you simply start from nowhere and not have any model whatsoever. Don't be afraid of models, it's the way you learn. It's the way you learn language from your mothers to start with you have to follow. You have to begin from somewhere. What matters is whether you do it well and that's what you're in this department to learn and you won't learn it just by writing music either. You'll learn it by going to lectures in philosophy, by learning history, by learning languages, because all these things works in ways that in some respect parallel music the way in which music works or relate to the way in which music works. I can't compose music all the time, I'd like to, but I can't do it, I can't support a child and send it give her the education I want, can't do it, all I can say is there is a huge reward at the end of it, which is the day you write your first piece that you know it doesn't matter what anybody else knows, it doesn't matter what anybody else says that you know is halfway decent is just a fantastic feeling, the best feeling there is in the world and it's even better if you have the people like it as well. But you know I mean it's only really you that knows whether or not you've done the job well. You might only ever do it once, you don't do it all the time. Now hang on, all our sorrow, let's just hear all our sorrow because we've got of life or of mirth yes. Is it a thing, perhaps if you're singing that note did you actually might have been singing that note? And so that's possibly how Organum began. This was fine provided it was a perfect fit not that dreadful tri tone that you all sang so beautifully. I don't know how to simplify it. Oh, I've done that great. Ah, Commonwealth Bank. It looks like a statement. Hmm. Ah, that's a pro formal letter. Thank you for your latent attention of eminent relationship to scholarships in connection with the matter of music degree, we appreciate you giving the bank the opportunity to participate in this project. As I hope you'll understand we receive many requests from a wide range of causes and as much as we would like to it is not possible to help on this occasion. We wish to congratulate your department on the important work that it is performing and our best wishes for its continuing success. Ah, that's a letter that gives nothing away at any level. And maybe I've gone about it in the wrong way and I'd just really appreciate some advice into whether it's worth trying again or trying a different way I could even possibly come and see Brian at some stage to get some advice on this sort of aspect. He did yes. Thank you, that's most informative, would you have any suggestion as to you know sort of other I mean well firstly is there any use as it were getting on a waiting list of some sort, I mean putting an application out there for long-term possible long-term consideration? Hm. I mean the other side of this is Fiona frankly if the universities don't succeed in getting support from the corporate sector an investment in the education of our young people quite frankly a lot of us will be out of business in a relatively short space of time. If they get shorter, then you build up intensity and you move to the point where you fuse you cross over from one texture into the other texture. - What comes down am I going to pay claim forms for people or not on your behalf if that's the worry. - We can't knowingly if we're over budget. - No. - And we can't do it. - So in Josquin's day he is by taking this I think he's probably I mean the subject of it making a point, a political point. - This whole document was presented. Calm down Winsome, try to calm down before you say it. - Oh, I'm just I've just been teaching all day since eight o'clock. So have I Winsome, all day without a break and I went to a meeting at lunch time, which was very stressful, you know you're not the only person that's overloaded in this department and I'm sick of you acting as though you are. Ah, that's a bit much. Ah, I've got three students coming at that time, now where the hell did this heads meeting come from that suddenly appeared in the computer and hasn't been there before? It was to have been on this date, that was crossed out because this now conflicts with the half day forum for the head of departments and dean's half day forum, but I mean how can I teach if I don't have time in which to teach, I've got to go to meetings. I can't go on teaching 20 hours a week. I'm not sick yet, but I could get sick I could easily get very sick. - I'm teaching more than 20 hours a week too. - We've taken up the slack again and again and again and now we've reached a stage where nobody can take up anymore slack and people are getting sick and falling down and also you know I think it actually starts to affect the agility in the department and it affects the extent to which we can care for our students and all those sorts of things. If we cut back our formal sort of teaching. - What we need, we need more staff members. - But we're not going to get more staff members until we got more students. I mean the question is... - We can't go on doing it, we can't going on doing this and if we don't agree on it, all that's going to happen is we're gonna have more and more in the department of some people saying I'm doing far too much and other people aren't doing enough when in fact what's happening people are just making decisions about I think perfectly reasonable sane decisions about what is a reasonable load and saying I'm not gonna take this year after year because I don't want to fall down with a stroke or a heart attack or cancer or whatever, it's not worth it. We should all be doing this. - I mean in terms of composers we'll have to just not admit, I mean our numbers it's a very very tricky situation Allan. We have to not admit composers into the the PhD for several years, we don't have to I mean as we do that the department gets smaller and smaller and smaller. There just ain't the dough around because we have been having these cuts year after year after year and every time now we have another cut it means we have to shut another course. We give you fewer tutorials, you get fewer instrumental lessons. I mean what kind of world is this? Every time you shut now I'm a professor of music and I'm fortunately I take that responsibility in some ways very very seriously because the idea of a professor is you're an advocate for your discipline, primarily you're an advocate for your discipline, you also carry huge responsibilities. Every time I have to cut something in this department, I know that I'm closing a door of knowledge in your faces and in my view you don't close doors to knowledge in the face of young people. You open as many as possible and invite them to walk through as many as they feel comfortable in some of they don't feel comfortable even, because it's terribly important. What are we going to do? - Well the... - I mean seriously are we going to allow this decline to go on happening we all know about it without doing something about it? - I don't know. - What can we do? - I come to you with a recommendation that we act on the motions that were put to the meeting last week that we pursue an industrial campaign that gets the university to see reason. - We're getting nowhere with management and sometimes we have to just do those hard things. It'd be much better if we didn't have to do them, but we're being forced into doing them and I think we need to remember that. - Yeah, I'd just like to draw attention to the larger picture. We have a vice chancellor who wrote in The Gazette quite recently, which goes out I believe to 160,000 people that it has to be admitted and I quote, I hope my memory is accurate, "It has to be admitted that higher education "in this country is in decline." What we're fighting for is not our salaries. I couldn't fight for just my I just can't do it, but I can fight for higher education. That's really what we're doing. We're fighting against the decline of higher education, for which this government to its eternal shame has just brought in a surplus budget without giving another cent to higher education and insisting that we carry on with a 1% cut across another three years. I'm the head of the department. I have been for most of my life. I am sick of running a deficit budget. This will be 10 years in which I have been asked to trim the budget in my department. I am now cutting quality out of the curriculum. I care about my students. I cannot continue to do it. This is what we are trying to resist. I totally support this proposition. - Say what you said before. - Stuff. - I like what you said before. - What was it, what was that, what was I saying? About how you're the head of department and the cuts and all that kind of stuff. - Right then, it's not working, I can't get it to work. It's not working, it's not working. - Isn't it? - No. - Well, gonna put a mic. - It might be out of batteries. All right men, we're turning off now, we're gonna deliver the demands. What do we want? - Job security. When do we want it? - Now. - What do we want? - Job security. - When do we want it? - Now. - What do we want? - Quality. - When do we want it? - Right now. - What do we want? - Quality. - When do we want it? - Now. - What do we want? - Quality. - When do we want it? - Now. - What do we want? - Job security. - When do we want it? - Now. - In light of this lack of progress, this meeting endorses the following industrial action. Firstly, a half day strike from midnight to midday on Wednesday, 2nd of June with picket lines to be established. - I'm the general manager of the security service and I can assure that it gets to, that they get to if you're satisfied with that. - Have you deputised to accept these... - I'm not a part of the executive management, no I'm not. - Would you mind if I went in and presented these to the personal assistant? - Yeah, I'll ask if the personal assistant can come out and take - The head of security has been duly authorised to accept the motions passed at the meeting of the National Tertiary Education Union. - I just tried to see if Dame Leonie was there and see if she knows that the university is dead, closed off, the university, the university that we knew is now dead, I wonder if she'd like to know that. She's not there to hear it anyway. She'd only have to come and look at the staff of her own university. I can't believe it. I never ever believed I would be in university on a day in which the vice chancellor shut his door to negotiation with his own staff. I can't believe that. We have always been a collegian institution. It's heartbreaking. I find it I'm right shocked. Soon as I saw that door, I must admit the image of Martin Luther came into my head. - But it's part of the union. I don't think he wants to know quite honestly. - But that's it, that's his staff. - Yes, Anne, yes. Well I'm afraid I'm not in the least shocked, no it's just the way. - Well it's hardly collegial. - I agree it's hardly collegial, yes hardly yes, but no I think any gang of students and staff or whatever seen you know gathering together at the corner of the quad and nobody wants to know. I know I don't think that anyone will be I'm not in the least surprised at all. - Well I mean the vice chancellor spoke to the students, has spoken to the students, but he won't speak to his own staff? Anyway, I can't believe it, I'm too upset. I've got to go and have a cup of coffee. I really feel upset. - I heard... - Stressed. - I didn't hear you speak, but a number of people said you spoke very well and were very proud of you. - Oh, well thanks, Chris I only said what I believed and people in that room were feeling, that's all. - Mm, yes, still they said you said means a lot. - Well it seems obvious. - Yes. - Yeah, well thanks anyway. We've got to win this one. It's war now, I mean it's out and out war. I mean we've got to win. Hi mate, did you know the university is on half day strike till 12 o'clock? - Eh? - The university's on a half day strike till 12 o' clock. - Is it? - Yeah. Do you belong to the union? You can't drive across now, you're actually driving across a picket line an official picket line so you'd be sort of strike breaking. - Oh okay. - If you'd like to turn your truck around, there's a turning circle just in there. - Yeah. - Thanks. Yep, I think you can just turn around just around there. Yeah. G'day, did you know the university's on a half day strike today? - No, not at all. - No? - Not at all. - Well it is, so if you drive across here you'd actually be strike breaking, you'd be driving across an official picket line. - Yeah. - Would you like to go up there till 12 noon? Okay, I'll come back. - Thank you my dear, okay if you want to turn the car around just on that turning circle there, bless you thanks a lot pinhead. Hey that's three cars and a truck. - Yes. - Yo. You've basically got... I'm getting into this. - You've got the charisma, haven't you? - I don't think so. We want them to bring the rights back, taking away the rights that students and everyone have a decent and well-funded public education system and it's this bullshit that we can't take anymore. - Students united will never be defeated. The universities are thought banks. They're knowledge banks. They're where knowledge in our communities reside. If they have to be protected, they have to be preserved, we have the opportunity to go on extending that knowledge. With the kind of staff cuts that are hitting universities, with the kind of degradation of academic life that is going on where we have no time anymore to do research because we care enough about you kids to want to put you first and to go on teaching you, there is no way we can go on protecting, preserving and extending knowledge and as we enter the 21st century the human race is going to be confronted with the kind of problems that we never had to deal with before. We need to be as clever as possible. This movement has gotta get the message. Bring universities back to the top of the funding priorities. E minor. But we know that they're in the key of E flat, okay here it is, nice big heroic settled key, but this point which I call the liberation of the human spirit is an E minor. Listen to that just about as remote from E flat as a key can possibly be. There's E flat and then E minor. Here that shift upwards by a semitone, that sweet moving from that heroic steady God-like key of E flat into E minor, the key of the spirit and so the spirit flies free at this point. Now this is profoundly symbolic in Beethoven's life. Unlike Haydn or Mozart before him, he had a different view of the artist in society. He didn't believe the artist was of the servant class. On the contrary, he believed that the artist was the most important member of society and far, far greater than the so-called ruling aristocrats of his own time. There's a lovely story about Beethoven and Goethe. The two of them were walking along and coming towards were a group of aristocrats. Goethe being the courteous gentleman he was stepped aside and doffed his hat in a way that was becoming of a gentleman. Beethoven however charged through the middle of them, hair flying and of course you know the ladies the rude, crude ugly impulsive horrible, rude, vulgar man and he joined up with Goethe afterwards and Goethe was a bit taken aback, he said, also Beethoven used to spit whenever he had the, anywhere he felt like it, he just used to spit. He probably spat as well, but we can add as an elaboration to the story. Goethe said, "Why did you do that?" And he said, "Because it is they who should give way to us." - This ceremony has been arranged in order to confer degrees upon and award diplomas and certificates to those who have fulfilled all the functions... Dear Lionie, on Wednesday last I knocked on your door on the off chance of being able to share with you directly my sense of despair in the present circumstances of higher education. - With honours class two, division one, Lara Jane Bodsley Smith. - Leonie, I have been cutting my department's budget now for nearly 10 years, I'm presently carrying a 20-hour-a-week teaching load which is unsustainable and every day I'm filled with further despair by some new tale of a beloved and esteemed colleague who has simply had enough and is quitting university. - With the BA past degree, Mervin James Adams. The collegiality is so completely eroded it seems to me that we no longer have an university in any terms that I can understand or relate to. - The degree of Master of Arts with merit, Jane Marie Cole. - I believe the flash point is very near. It distresses me to find myself so much at odds with people I once regarded and in many cases still regard in such high esteem as academic colleagues. I cannot any longer accept the downgrading of this university without voicing my protest in every possible way, okay. - I've got a lecture to give on Beethoven's Ninth tomorrow about the brotherhood of man. I just don't think it's worth doing. Anyway the next day I fell foul of Bettina and she had a go at me and reduced me to tears. It stings still. I didn't leave, I bloody felt like leaving. I better go, my colleagues will start getting mad with me for being late and they'll have a reason. I take some. Anyway, offered to resign as head of department to Bettina because she accused me of not staying in touch in a responsible way with what was happening, so I offered to resign and she didn't accept my resignation. I wanted to leave then. I knew at that stage I couldn't leave, because it would have been gutless apart from anything else. I wasn't going to give my colleagues the satisfaction of seeing that I'm broken down under that sort of pressure. I did break down and anyway the day went on and it was I can show you the agenda was about things like fundraising, it was obvious the vice chancellor said one or two things more which made sense in terms of might have been able to understand where he's coming from, which is his view and it's not an unreasonable one is that you do all you can to influence government policy when it's in its formation, but once it's policy and once it's legislated you have a responsibility to work to operate within it. I can see that's a fair point of view, but when you feel that policy is wrong, what do you do, you know it's a real moral dilemma. It's a terrible dilemma. - Is there an agenda? - Yup, it's all circulated. It was done on Wednesday. But right in our diction class this morning... - I don't care when the write was done on Wednesday Winsome, that's all I said. - I'm leaving. - Okay, so am I. Sorry, but that's bad. And I'm going to have you'll have my resignation as well as head of department. I can't go on, I just can't go on without support from my colleagues. No, I'm the one who does all the apologizing around here. I'm not gonna do it anymore. Just this time I need a bit of understanding and support from my colleagues as well. There needs to be some sort of respect and even sympathy for the job of being the head of a department in a time like this. Anyway, I don't know what I'll do. Probably nothing for the time being. I'll just let things settle down and try and get myself up and running again. I do know that I've got to start writing some music. If I don't write some music I'll burst. Okay now so what are we trying to write here, what is it? - A kyrie, I didn't put the words in I was so disgusted with it. I decided to use the pange lingua having listened to just kind of... - See. - Pange lingua mass. - Yeah, eight octaves, Karen why are you, which people wouldn't use octave, only occasionally an octave justified and only when you need colour. What about? Instead of because as soon as you do that you've resolved it. Finish, but if you do then that note has to do something. And then you actually start on a discord instead of. Do what you've written. - Okay. - Palestrina's written music like this. If you can't say something original, if you can't say something a bit different then just leave it to him, there's no point in regurgitating. And also what is kyrie doing? What is it, what is it in the service? What is it doing? - It's the very beginning and it's pleading for mercy. - It's being in the presence of God, for God's sake. I mean it's magical. It's divine. It's got to do that. It comes from out there. I mean be like Beethoven, be electrical, because that's what music is about, connecting to spiritual energy, let it happen. I mean this is not being in the presence of God. When Palestrina it brought him, sorry I bloody just about gave you a heart attack, but seriously you've got to get into this from that kind of energy that sort of spiritual energy. You are it's a magical opening to a magical ritual. I mean bringing us into the presence of God. Sorry. Well that's what you should be doing. So clean slate, start again and let the magic happen and if it doesn't, then don't be a composer, go away, do something else. There's so many people walking around this Earth trying to be composers and they can't bloody write music. They shouldn't be doing it. Don't be one of them, you've got a lot of talent. You can do it. Anyway, sorry, do you want a cup of tea? Dear, what do you want just green or normal tea? - Just black please. - That ordinary English tea. - Ordinary English tea, no sugar. - Okay okay. - Oh I love that. Fantastic, one two. Yeah, there's more. Done. One, two. One, two, three. So. My dear moder into one two today. Lovely, that's much better, lovely. - Yeah, so it's also more romantic and more spiritual. - Yes, it can be even more expansive, it can be even more expansive still. - You see and that also... - And this is... Solves the downs really. A metaphor for eternity, for eternal life you know so absolutely marvelous, yeah that's much better, sounds good. And that time that tempo it really, really worked. And those dynamics really, really worked. I mean get rid of those triple Fs, I mean they're shocking. They should not be there. I'm sorry about that. It should in fact be a decrescendo after moder, but there is an absolutely break or should be at the end of bar 265, that's one of the points which there needs to be a. You do a crescendo and then do a diminuendo and come off together. One and. - So you wouldn't consider being acting head then for next year. - Oh. I mean there are certain things that I would quite happily do, but I can't use the computer I mean. We'd find a way around that I mean Chris or Michelle can come in and download your messages for you. - And I wouldn't go to meetings and I'm telling you now I wouldn't go to meetings. - Well I think the department can survive if we don't go to meetings, I mean I'll go to faculty board meetings and that sort of thing I don't mind doing that, but basically Winsome I just need some time I think to get over the trauma I've been through in recent months in terms of the shock I've had of realizing that as a manager I mean I think I'm bad news for the department. - I just I have to think about it. - Well I don't know Winsome I mean I. Well I feel I mean I... - I've got to tell Bettina in a few months time if I'm gonna be batting with her again next year and I really want to say no. Not only my health will take it to be honest and I really have got to prioritise composing again. I mean you know I love this department and I love what we represent as a group of people you know that and I know that you do too. - I do. - To a fault we have this both of this thing to a fault. I found 10 days this year in which I've been able to compose. - Mm. Oh dear. I don't think there's a really good way out of this actually. Your tone was stunning, thank you very much. - Thank you. - That's wonderful. Thank you. - Thank you. - Thanks so much. - Thank you. And I'm not going to make myself available as the head of department next year and the way I'm feeling at the moment about the culture of the university, I would really like never to make myself available as head of the department again, because I just don't feel I can cope with the economic rationalist philosophy on which we are now within we are now expected to operate. I thought about this and I now feel that for the rest of my life I want to make an absolute priority of my composing, that composition is the thing that I really, really want to do as a first priority. I don't wish to resign as an academic. I enjoy my teaching tremendously in fact probably more so now than I did as a younger person. Now but then this brings us back, that's my personal decision, this brings us back to the business of the department and it seems to me and I've thought about all of you and your own priorities and so on and I realise that in a sense this is putting us all in the lurch, but it's a lurch I'm afraid we're going to have to embrace. - It's sort of difficult to deal with this with it coming out of the blue the way it has because I think everybody's probably got plans and commitments that were predicated on the assumption that you were going to continue, which is I mean basically the indication it's always been that you did want to continue. So I think we need time to think this out and I think probably we need to talk amongst ourselves a little bit outside of the context of a meeting and particularly the people who are affected. I don't particularly want to have a really public discussion about this. I don't feel ready to. I mean I've known about it for five minutes and I've just spent two weeks making all sorts of commitments. - Ah there's no B in it. - It's an A minor chord isn't it? - No A, just a A. - No it's A minor. - Without the B. - Mm. I'm not sure about that last, I like absolutely everything is wonderful until that last chord anyway move on we'll come back to it at the end. Oh good girl do your thing. - This is a pentatonic collection you see in the context of C sharp minor and there you get the first characteristic Bartok dissonance the so-called black and white contrast that he uses so much in his music. This is the only little bit of you get, this prismatic colour if you like, the colour that comes through the mode. I've just written a piece that uses that technique. It's a wonderful technique to explore, because there's so many colours to find within individual modes. And if you think E minor, here's the E minor chord it's not really very far to shift that to C sharp minor is it? Sorry, got the repeat. Tricky, isn't it? - I just don't even know where, I don't even know where to begin to address this Chris. - No. - I mean I don't even know how to make a case for special needs, the discrepancy is now so great. - Yes. I don't, I... - I mean do we get our knickers in a twist at this stage or do we just take a long deep breath and calm down and say it all get worked out, it will work out again next year? I think in terms of... I mean what does one do at this stage? I think in terms of sanity one has to do that. - So there goes MIDI techniques, there goes Australian music, there goes computer music. - Yes, all computer music courses have to go. - There goes oh here here, an obligatory course, 18th century harmony and counterpoint. There goes human mood, well we've accepted that's gone anyway. - Yes yes. - Introduction to electronic music gone. - Stravinsky goes. - These events, I already put the page on notice. I'm softening the blow and saying we're gonna try and offer that every second year because I cannot cut that out of our curriculum. - It's gonna be very popular I think. - We'll have to go to a two-year curriculum. I mean that's not irrational. We'll have to go to a two-year curriculum. I think that's been on the cards for some time. But one can say that it's a rational decision yes, we go to a two-year curriculum, one can say that with a nice happy smile on one's face. What does that mean? It means that the class size is double and what does that mean? It means the quality of teaching goes down. - Yes, that's right. - I mean you know here we go again, but it gets worse every year doesn't it? Introduction to Stravinsky gone, Music Publishing gone. Orchestration. - Orchestration. - Gone. - And that's a compulsory course. That's a compulsory course it has to remain again, that's a core course. - As is 20th Century Harmony, but that is under the dean's guideline that no tutor may give a discreet unit then 20th Century Harmony would have to go as well because the chairman does that all by himself. So that's not a one... - So that's gone. - Yes. - But that's also core. - We cannot offer... - That's also core. - Yep. - Is that core? - Yes it is, yes it's Composition 2. - Yes, Composition 2, that's right. - All keyboard goes. That's all done by casual staff. - Yeah, God. - Don't worry, that's why it's important to fight. - We've got a legal obligation... - What we can't do Allan and this is what I've been through in my mind with a sense of nausea many times over the last five days when I've had to think about these matters what I can't do in conscience is go back to the faculty and ask for more. - Yes you can. - I don't know where the money came from last year considering that faculty hadn't got any. - We went into deficit and we had been asked to address our deficit as a faculty and we have to repay and it's costed over several years, there will be a lot of pain involved very few replacement posts will be made. We have to repay it to the university within a limited number of years. We need to be entrepreneurial now, go out and find money to support from the outside community to support part-time teaching. We were told that as heads. I can't do it, I've already put my cards on the table in that regard, I'm not an entrepreneurial person. I cannot go out and ask for funds. I'm just incapable I can't do it. - What is very very important in a crisis situation is to remember the decisions we made in our wisdom when we were not in a crisis situation and when we were not the crisis situation it was very clear to us that people were overworked and if people were overworked they were going to get sick and they were going to be inefficient. We may have to make more radical cuts to our syllabus than we want to, we simply cannot teach a syllabus that we can't teach. - I feel obliged to teach all the things I taught as many things as I taught in the first semester and to do the marking that I do and build it in into the structure of my life because it is my life and I am quite prepared to do it for the salary I get and I'm not going to do less because three or four of you decide that that's too many courses. I'm not doing less. It's going to stay. I think that addresses an important question of principle. - I mean we have already decided that the questions of teaching load is something that we were going to take as a group and it simply won't work Winsome if you say that you're not going to take any notice that might be arrived at by the DBM. - No I'm an individual I do not operate as a group. I do not have group opinion, I do not share group opinions in this country I still believe that you can a single voice can operate that you are entitled to an opinion and you're entitled to work the way you want to work. - I only think... - I don't regard my teaching load as a problem. I think my teaching load is sustainable. In crisis times I'm more than willing to continue with my teaching load and carry the head ship load undeterred. That's my choice as an individual and I've made it. I've agreed to stay head of department for one more year and I'm willing to carry a normal teaching load plus the head ship duties without complaint. - If in this situation, both Anne and Winsome go against what I would construe as the advice of the DBM then indeed I suppose they have an individual right to do that. I think it should be understood that it is against the advice of us as a group, whatever that might mean and that they should also realise that there can be no equity considerations arising from that particular decision to land themselves with what we really as jointed consider is too much work. - You are obliged to fill in on the front of cover your name, your given names, your student number and your seat number.
