(engine revving) (gun firing) (lively music) (lively music continues) (ominous music) (laid-back music) - Now, that's everything I know about this girl. Can I have my passport? I've got a plane to catch in a couple of hours. - Your Lordship. - You are Pekoe Rayne? You shared a room with Juliet Blake? I regret, mademoiselle, the matter of identifying the body. Your passport, please. - I gave him mine already. Go ahead. - Sinclair. Lord Sinclair. We are honored. Did you know the deceased? - No, why should I? - She was a British subject. - There are 50 million of us. - Then what do you want with me? My knowledge of English is what you put on a cue ball. Spin, you know. - The questions are necessary, gentlemen. They are part of my job. - Well then, why don't you do your job, pal, and find out why she drowned. - Why does anybody drown? Water enters the lungs. - Yes, it's quite simple. You can do it without even a lesson. - One hairpiece, one wristwatch, one beach bag found near the sign warning swimmers that part of the beach was unsafe. And the body of a girl. Death by drowning. These are the simple facts. - The wristwatch isn't waterproof. Why would she go swimming wearing it? - Yeah! Answer that question for His Lordship. - Perhaps she was distraught. - Distraught? Did you ever hear of a dame distraught enough to go swimming with her hairpiece on? - These are busy times and I am badly overworked. If you wish to make an issue of this, let me assure you these incidents are not uncommon. - Incidents? - The body of some poor unfortunate is found in our beautiful bay, meant for pleasure rather than death. The lungs full of salt water. No marks, no bruises. A simple casualty of the undertow. - Just one moment, Inspector. I'm beginning to wonder if there's not another casualty here, something in the line of a proper police investigation. - I do my best under the circumstances. - What circumstances is that? - You must understand, gentlemen, that I am hopelessly understaffed and this is the holiday season. - I gotcha. So this girl we go fish out of the water ends up nothing more than shark bait, huh? What did you call it a minute ago, an "incident"? I tell you something, if this was some Maharani or Maharaja or somebody like that, you'd have your police cars driving all over the water looking for evidence and suspects, you- - You have positively identified the body? - It's Julie. - Thank you. You may all go. You may go. - Our passports? - In due course. - When is that due gonna be coursed, sir? - There is the inquest to be held. - When? - Oh, a day, two days, a week. - Lucky I talk police. What he's saying is when he's good and ready. - These things take time. - What are you gonna do about Julie? - Nothing. He's gonna take Julie's file and stick it in the bottom of some drawer somewhere. Nothing. - He can't do that! You've gotta find out how she died. - She went into the water. Death by drowning. Perhaps an accident, most likely suicide. - Julie would never do that. Never! Why, she... He doesn't even care! I mean, nobody cares. - Come on. - It's as if she never existed. - Keep my passport handy. 'Cause if you think that's an ugly picture, wait till you see what I look like when I see you again. (mellow music) - Well, what do you think? - What do I think? I think it is very difficult to appear stupid. - An excellent performance. You appeared just callous enough to stir them into action. - I am most grateful to you, Judge Fulton. - Oh, nonsense. Small return for all the help you've given me in the past. What do you think of them? - Most acute. - You seem puzzled. - Why this charade? They're your friends, aren't they? - Of course they are. - Why don't you just ask them to help me? - Because it's the last thing they'd do. The mere thought of being involved in a good cause and they'd be off like a pair of greyhounds. You wouldn't see their tails for dust. - Alive. Julie was always so alive. It just doesn't seem possible. - Do you think it was an accident? Her drowning? - Julie? Never. She was a 500-meter champion before she ever became a dancer. - Are you a dancer, too? - Yes. - You work here with Julie? - Yes. A grotty little club called La Reve. If you really want a laugh, I'm one of the Quinn Travis Go-Go Girls. - What was Julie like? - She was a nice kid, full of life. - Boyfriends? - Julie was very choosy. You had to be rich to rate with her. - There's nothing so wrong with that, is there? - I love it, I love it. - That makes her sound awful. She never did anything really wrong. It's only that... Julie Blake wasn't just a name, two words that add up to nothing. I mean, people aren't just flies that you squash and flick off your wrist. It's more than that. I mean, somebody's got to sit up and say "Julie Blake was here." Nobody's got a right to dismiss her life that way. I feel so helpless. I don't want Julie to just end up in a police file, buried and forgotten. I don't know what to do. - Daniel, how would you like to make sure Inspector Blanchard never forgets Julie or us? - You mean dig a little bit, right? - Yes, stir a few things up. Throw the cat in amongst the pigeons. - Nicely put. - But why should you two want to help? - Because we'd like to shove it in the face of this inspector a little bit. - I suppose you could put it that way. Come on, I'll take you home. - Oh no, I've got a rehearsal. Our fearless leader's called one for this afternoon. - I'll tell you what. Why don't you spend the day with His Majesty the Prince here and I'll go square it with, uh, what's the name? - Quinn Travis. - Quinn Travis, right. I'll see you later. Toodle-oo. See you later. - Mind the step. (energetic music) - Move it, move it, move it, move it, move it. Now sharp. Good. (energetic music continues) And stretch. Sharp. Up, down. Up, down. - Hi! - Sharper, sharper! (energetic music continues) (energetic music continues) - [Danny] Koestler? What's his first name? Lanning Koestler. (suspenseful music) - There you are. All of a sudden, the gay exciting life of a traveling trouper begins to tarnish at the edges. - You seem to know how to take care of yourself. - So did Julie. (suspenseful music) (Pekoe gasping) (suspenseful music) (engine revving) (tires squealing) - Would you believe he got away? - Oh! - Who was he? - Never seen him before. - What was he after? - I think there's a picture missing. - What is it? - It's Julie's trophy book. Some people collect autographs. She collected pictures of her boyfriends. - You have any idea whose picture is missing? Someone from the past or someone new? - I don't know. She must have seen him, though, because she missed rehearsal yesterday and she didn't come back here last night. - Have you any idea where she went? - None at all. She rented a car, is that any help? - Well, it could be. Let's try the rent-a-car agencies. - Isn't your friend supposed to meet us here? - What else are friends for except to desert you in the hour of need? - It seems impossible to believe that she died for no reason. - Well, it should be obvious now that someone thought there was reason enough. - Then you are convinced it was no accident? - Murder never is. - Julie Blake. - That's it. You any idea who checked her out? - Oui, monsieur. I did myself. - Oh, when? - You are a good friend of hers? - Yes. - Yes, I am. Why? - She forgot to pick up the balance of her deposit. - Balance? - Of course, we had to take out for the other expenses. For the flat tire and the bent wheel she left behind. - That's Julie all right. - And we had to send out a truck to pick up the car. - Where? (ominous music) All right, thank you. (mellow music) How's your French? - Non, non. - Is that it? - Oui, oui. - You wait here. Bonjour, monsieur. (clearing throat) Bonjour. (Brett speaking French) (mechanic speaking French) Julie was here all right. He saw her take a side road 100 yards on. - And he remembered her? - Remembered her? He can't forget her. She reversed into his petrol pump. (lively music) (suspenseful music) (birds singing) Anybody home? Tarzan must be out. And Jane must be shopping too. - They're all stuffed! (bird singing stops) - For one horrible moment, I thought I was going deaf. You have quite a collection of birds. - Mr. Koestler is known internationally as an ornithologist. - I have a similar reputation myself. I was rather under the impression that we were expected. - Mr. Koestler's in conference at the moment. He said nothing to me. - Then we shall wait. While you announce us. - Certainly, Lord Sinclair. Matthew Crane. I am Mr. Koestler's executive assistant. If you and the young lady would care to make yourselves comfortable. (phone buzzing) Forgive me, I must answer that. The lounge is just through the arch. - "Koestler" ring a bell? - No. It was pretty clever of you find out his name that way. Slick operator, aren't you? - It's a talent I acquired. - Hey, what's this "Lord" bit? - It's a talent I inherited. - Crane here. - The two that just arrived. - You're sure? All right, don't worry. Just keep out of sight until I get rid of them. - Lanning Koestler. Do you recognize him? I suppose it's hardly surprising. Despite the fact he is a very a large international financier, he's one of those people who likes his corporations public but his life very private. - Too private, I'm afraid. Welcome to the Koestler monastery. - [Brett] Thank you. - I'm sorry for barging in like this. The door was open and- - Oh, don't be silly. It's marvelous to have visitors. - You've got a lovely place, Mrs. Koestler. - Lisa. And you? - Pekoe Rayne. And this is Lord- - Sinclair. Brett Sinclair. - Very nice to meet you. - Lord Sinclair? Really? - I'm sorry, Lord Sinclair. Mr. Koestler is very busy and cannot see you. - It'll only take a few moments, and I have come all the way up here. - It's quite out of the question, I'm afraid. - Call him. I'm sure he can manage two minutes. - He's in conference and left orders not to be disturbed. - Get him, Matthew. Tell Lanning I want him down here immediately. (tense music) - This is what I'm offering. 1/3 cash, 2/3 in notes redeemed at any time. - What about my offer, cash for those subsidiaries? All I'm asking for is a handshake agreement. - Now, look, if it's all the same to you, I'd like to have it down on paper so I can show these people in Texas. - Remember that deal we put together back in Houston? That was Dallas, six years ago next week. - Houston. Don't fool with my photographic memory. - Mr. Koestler, I'm sorry to interrupt, sir. - I thought I told you I wanted no interruptions. - You have visitors, sir. - Visitors? - Your wife said it'd only take a few minutes. I'm sure you can dismiss them very quickly. - Come on, Daniel. We need the break anyway. - Right, yeah. When are you gonna be in London again? - I don't know, you know? I fly here, I fly there. - When Lanning said it was a mountain retreat, I had no idea how cut off from the world this place would be. - Thank you. - Please, sit down. - [Danny] Who was the first one that stuffed these birds? - I'm not sure about that. Well, here I am. - How did you- - What, young lady? - Manage to find a place like this? - I'd be more interested in how you found this place. - Now, Lanning, there's no need to pose as some ogre ready to devour our visitors. Can I introduce Miss Pekoe? - Hi. I'm Danny Wilde, and you're very cute. You're cute yourself. - Cut it out. - What did you say? I didn't hear you. - I said I didn't catch your name. - Oh, I see. Thank you. My name is Danny Wilde, what's yours? - Sinclair. Brett Sinclair. - Good for you. - Lord Brett Sinclair. - Lord Brett Sinclair! Well, double good for him. Now, what am I supposed to do, curtsy? - It certainly wouldn't be out of place with the rest of your behavior. - That's one up on you, Danny boy. - Well, you're in good company, I can see that. Will you excuse me? - Now, Lord Sinclair, let's come to the purpose of your visit. I wonder whether we could have a few moments alone together. It is rather private. - Excuse. They wanna be alone. How do you know he's a Lord? Really, have you seen his papers or his pedigree? Have you seen where he came from? - All right, what brings you here? - Julie Blake. - So she sent you? I might have known. - Why don't you tell me, then? Then we'll both know. - You came up here uninvited and I'm quite busy. Let's not play games. - I'm not playing games, Mr. Koestler. - Lisa? Lisa? If you wanna talk about Julie, talk in front of my wife. - [Lisa] What is it, darling? - Lord Sinclair has something to tell us about Julie Blake. - Then you both know her? - She knows I had an affair with Julie three years ago. - Then forgive me, what was she doing here three years after the event? - Trying to blackmail me. Just like you are, I suppose. But you see, my wife knows everything, so there's no point to your visit. - How's this for a point? Julie Blake is dead. (glass shattering) (ominous music) - I got Koestler hooked on a deal now and we're all right for the next few- - That's him? - What? - That's him! - What, there? What do you mean, it's him? Who is he? - The man I told you about, the man in my room. That was him and that's the car. - Are you absolutely sure? - Absolutely. - This must be the place. - I'm sorry. Truly sorry. How'd it happen? - She drowned. - How terrible. - Is that why you came here? To tell us about the girl? - No, we don't know the circumstances. I thought you could help us trace her movements during those last few hours. - I'm afraid we can't help you any further. Last time we saw her, she was alive. What, what happened afterwards, I. - Is there anything else? - At the moment, no. - Then you must excuse me. - (Danny knocking) Hello, it's us again. Finished with your private business? - Yes, thank you, Mr. Wilde. Pekoe, we should be leaving. Mrs. Koestler, Mr. Koestler. Goodbye. - Excuse me for a minute. Wait a minute. (whistling) Wait a minute. Hey! I wanna talk to you. Don't go so fast. - You are about as subtle as a 15 shilling hairpiece. How did you get here? - Pekoe will have to fill you in. Goodbye. It was so nice to see you. Visit us again on Wednesday. Thank you. Call that number in London. - What number? - You know the number. London, number, call it, dumdum. Oh, Crane. - About your call to Texas. There's a five or six-hour delay. - Oh, there is, huh? Well, what do you suggest I do? - You may as well stay the night. You'll find everything you need in the bedroom upstairs, next to the study. - Wonderful. Thanks a lot. See you later. Bye. Call me when that call comes. So long. - I can't believe it. I'm shocked. It's beyond all comprehension. - Aren't you rather overacting a little bit, my darling? - She was here, in this very room. You saw her. A beautiful child. - She was trying to blackmail us. - She was so vital, so alive. - There was so much at stake. - She's dead now. A terrible thing, Lanning. But you must realize the danger she represented. The whole Koestler empire would have crashed at the breath of a scandal. - You killed her, and you don't seem to care. What kind of people are you? - Show him, Matthew. (ominous music) - Houston. You met him in Houston. It was Dallas! Make one more mistake like that, my friend, and you'll end up in the bay like Julie Blake did. (ominous music) - Time to go meet Danny. If we're not back by 12:30, you drive to the garage and call Inspector Blanchard. And you stay there. Okay? (suspenseful music) (suspenseful music continues) - Come on in. Come on in, Your Lordship. (suspenseful music continues) (Brett gasping) You're always late. Always. - What do you mean, late? - Late, late, late. - Why didn't you open the front door? - I told Pekoe you were supposed to come to the side door, the back door, not the front. - The back door? I've never come through a servants' entrance in my life. I don't see why I should start now. Listen, did you dig anything up about Koestler? - Yes, there's a room there full of their secrets. And I found out something else. - What's that? - He likes birds. I had a cousin who gave his mother for her birthday a very exotic bird, spoke five different languages. A couple of days later, he gets worried, he calls his mother and he says, "Well, listen, Ma, did you get my present?" And she said- - Delicious. - Wait a minute. "Delicious?" He says. "But Ma, that was a genuine South African cockamamie bird and it spoke five different languages!" And she said- - "Then he should have said something." Now I'm going to go. - You know, if this... It's, uh, it's locked. - How do we get in, then? - Well, with ingenuity, craftsmanship, and logic. - You stole the key? - Right. (suspenseful music) Well, well, well. It looks like a Do-It-Yourself Empire Building kit. - I prefer a Rembrandt on the wall myself. - Excuse me, what are we supposed to be looking for? What is it? - Daniel, you are a high-finance expert, right? - That's me. I love the word. - And you also love figures? - Right. What kind of figures are we- - Feast your eyes on those. - Right. Let's see. ♪ On top of Old Smokey ♪ (printer whirring) Hey! How do like that? - Like what? - A stock I bought about three weeks ago went up four points. - Oh, well, I tell you, Daniel, I'd like it even more if I'd bought some. Why is it everything you tell me to buy just drops four points? - Get a better broker. - What have we got here? A people's index. Names, photographs, dates, places, presumably when and where they met. Even what the weather was like. Let's see what the Ws bring forth. Wilburs, Arnold. Wickley. Wilde, Daniel. '64. Couldn't be your age, could it? No. Place, Dallas. - Dallas? - The weather was fine. - Wait a minute, wait a minute. - Occupation. - Wait a minute! Dallas? I was right, he was wrong. It wasn't Houston, it was Dallas. I was right. Is there any chance of getting in on this conversation? - Yeah, listen, Koestler is supposed to have this photographic memory, right? - Right. - Yeah, right. Well, if he's got a photographic memory, how come he can't remember the difference between Dallas and Houston, huh? - You tell me. - I tell you something, I'm putting two and two together. - And what are you coming up with? - I'll tell you what. Why don't you go snoop around and see what you can find? I'm gonna go back to these books. I think we're coming up with something, pal. Ugh, what a lousy picture. - I thought it was quite good, actually. That's strange, they leave their ledgers open, but lock up their glasses. (suspenseful music) - Transfers of stockholdings flow from one majority ownership to another. It started one year ago, very secret. Koestler's holdings being liquidated and moved to a neutral corporation. And then they're forming a new holding company. - Those figures tell us something? - Well, it's the kind of a plan I would put into motion if I were gonna retire. - Or die. - Koestler? - Come and look at the Late Show. - [Daniel] Hey, what's that all about? - [Brett] It's not just an ordinary home movie. The one and only Lanning Koestler. - [Danny] Yeah, that's who it is. Koestler. - Look at these cassettes. Hands, walking, gestures, golf, eyes, smile. You know what this is all about? - Tell me. - My dear Daniel, this is a complete cassette course in how to be Lanning Koestler. - Got it. Well, he fooled me. - Yeah, but he didn't fool an old bedmate. - Julie Blake. - That's right. She found out that this one is not the real Lanning Koestler. So she got a quick lesson in drowning. - Hmm. Well, I hate to walk out on a movie, but. - I think we better. - I can't wait to tell this Inspector Blanchard what we've found. - Yes, it'll take the smile off his smug face. (phone ringing) - It could be for me, you know. - Self-denial is healthy. (suspenseful music) - Listen, if you like bird stories, you're gonna love this one. - Who is it down there? - Nobody here but us birds. - There you are, Mr. Wilde. - Yeah, right. - I was looking for you in your room. Your call to Texas has just come through. - Wonderful! Is there any place up here I can take it? - Er, well, yes, in the study. - Good. We'll take it in the study. Let's not waste electricity. (suspenseful music) Okay, then it's a deal, is it? Right, and I have the authority to sign all the contracts? Okay, fine. Yes, it'll be two corporations, a million apiece. Talk to you on Thursday, eight o'clock. Right, your time. Bye. Matthew, it's all set. - This calls for a celebration. Contracts are all ready. - Okay. (suspenseful music) (footsteps approaching) - Brett? Brett, is that you? - Where's Sinclair? Where? One false move from you and you're both dead, you understand? (suspenseful music) - Come on. I don't think Danny's gonna be able to stall Crane on the case this much- What's the matter? (suspenseful music) You got something in your eye? Let me have a look. I think I've got a clean handkerchief. Oops. (ominous music) Yes, well. I suppose it's quite a nice evening for a walk, hmm? - These corporations are worth a lot more than two million. - Then why are you selling them at such a bargain? - I need the cash to maneuver. Without my personal attention, the entire Koestler empire would collapse overnight. - Here's to everybody getting what they deserve, right? (suspenseful music) - In there. (suspenseful music continues) - What are you looking for? - The rest of the car, so we can drive out of here. See? It's a carburetor. - Oh, I have plans for that two million cash. Another deal, strike quickly, get out fast. That's what keeps me alive. - The best advice I ever heard. - What's going on? - You can stop the act now. - What do you mean? I think Mr. Wilde knows. - Knows what? - You're a phony and the real Koestler's dead, huh? Excuse me, but who are you? - Morgan Alcott, a rather inferior actor. - Well, I don't think you were so bad. - With one remarkable talent. - Yes, for looking exactly like your dear departed husband. What did he die of? Kisses? - It was a natural death, in his sleep. You can't imagine how unprepared we were. If it had got out, we wouldn't have had time to- - Time, that's it. You needed time, didn't you, to be able to transfer his stocks to corporations that you controlled. - You understand! - Sure I understand. I'm a businessman. Perhaps we could, in some way? - Don't be ridiculous. - There's no harm in exploring the situation. - Right. - Exactly what would you want to come in with us? - What's the going price for this actor? - A million dollars and a new identity. - Oh, well, that's not a bad contract for such a short engagement. - What? - Oh, didn't you tell him what a short engagement it was gonna be? Well, don't you see they can't keep any loose ends floating around? They're going to really have to prove that Koestler is dead. - That's just about enough, Mr. Wilde. - What does he mean? - Well, what I mean is the rest of the world thinks that Koestler is alive, right? Now, I had a look at your books, sweetheart, and none of these transactions are gonna work unless you can prove and come up with a body. - That's enough. - Right? Now, they're gonna need a body that looks like Koestler, right? Well, you look like Koestler. I think they're gonna star you in a funeral. (Crane groaning) (suspenseful music) - Hello, Noddy. Have you had enough sleep? I'll tell you what we could do. Leave word with the hall porter for a late call and a cup of tea. - Help me up, will you, Your Lordship? Oh, my head. That driver, if I ever get a hold of him I'll- - Yeah? - What are we gonna do now, pal? - How do you feel about three-handed bridge? - Well, I only see two of us. - You remember Pekoe? - There are three of us. Pekoe, how are you? Imagine that. What have we got here? Look at that, look at that! We've got a lot of oil, rags, and we got gasoline. A lot of gasoline, enough to blow up a tank. We could even build one. - You're planning a Molotov cocktail? - Right. - No bottle. - Well, that's all right. We'll take these cans and we'll take these rags and stuff 'em in, right? In the gasoline, a lot of 'em. Then we'll take a long fuse and then we'll light it. - And blow ourselves up. - That's it. - See, Pekoe? I told you not to worry. Daniel always thinks of a way out of everywhere. - How far will you two go? - We can't just close our eyes and hope they'll go away, can we? - Maybe Danny Wilde may be right. How will you account for Koestler's disappearance if you don't produce a body? - How can I explain to you there's nothing to worry about? - Have you two planned to kill me all along? - Of course not! - You must learn to trust us. As we trust you. If you really don't believe us, take the car key and go out those doors and drive away from us. And your million dollars. (suspenseful music) - It's a trick. It's some kind of trick. - Come on, Matthew, it's getting late. Some of us must get some rest. (suspenseful music) (Danny whistling) - You got some marshmallows? No? - I guess I could slip out and get some. - Shame. (suspenseful music) - Oh, I'm mortified. - Never mind, Daniel, you get X for effort. - Well, that's all right, you know... I did it! - Come with me, quickly. - Beautiful, beautiful, Daniel. I love that short upper jab. - Get in the car. - Here's the key. - Poor Morgan Alcott. Not a bad actor, but he was so predicable. - Yes, well, that would seem to take care of three dangerous witnesses. - Not to mention one no-longer-necessary husband. Did you fix the door locks? - Everything. They're on their way down now. - Good. Make sure they go all the way down. (suspenseful music) (engine revving) (tires squealing) - First day out of driving school? - Guess what? - I don't have to. Somebody fixed the brakes. - Right. (suspenseful music) (tires squealing) - Sloppy, sloppy. - What do you mean? That was a perfect four-wheel drift. (suspenseful music) How would you stop something like this? (Danny and Brett exhaling) - I don't suppose- - What? - Oh. Let's get out of here. They really fixed us good, didn't they? (suspenseful music) Okay, everyone. (lively music) (crowd cheering) - Bravo, bravo. Come here. - Here, shampoo for you all. - I'm sorry, I have a party. - You forgot to return for your passports. And my thanks. - My pleasure. Here, have a drink. Why don't you give this to His Lordship? Your Majesty, the commissioner wants you. - Lord Sinclair, if there's anything I can do. - Can you do the Chicken? - Chicken? - Forget it. I'll keep these. (lively music) (mellow music) - Here, let me help you. Let's see what you got here. Oh, isn't that nice? It looks like somebody. You're an artist. - No! Am I? - Now, let's see. Here, let me help you with this. I'll take this, you take that, okay? No, I'll take this and you take, no, as a matter of fact. No, I tell you what, let me have the easel back. You take the purse, and. Here, you can take this right back, (woman groaning) (suspenseful music) - You're wanted on the phone. Your wife's in the maternity hospital. Congratulations! (suspenseful music) (suspenseful music continues) (siren blaring) - [Announcer] We regret to announce a two-hour delay in the departure of flight 951. - What can I do for two hours? Can you tell me that, Your Lordship? - I'll tell you what I'm going to do. I'm going back to the bar. But if you had any class, you would charter a flight. - If I could find a flight that I could charter, I would do that. (officer speaking French) What is he talking about? What did he say? - I think he's telling you that even if you could charter a flight, you wouldn't be leaving on it, Daniel. - Why wouldn't I be leaving? What are you talking about? - Why would someone shoot a young girl like that? - Now, how would I know? That's for the police to figure out. It's not my problem. - Oh, indeed it is your problem. I think that bullet was meant for you. - Nobody's got a right holding me, including these police. - They're not holding you. They're merely requesting you not to leave the country. - Well, I've got a right to leave this country any time I want, right? - Legally, right. - Right. - However, I have given my personal assurance that you won't. - What? - Only until they complete the investigation. - Shouldn't take more than six months. - Very funny. Very, very funny. - You can't come up with gems every time, Daniel. - Look, there must have been 20 or 30 other passengers on that tarmac. Why didn't the police hold them? - Well, apparently, they were at a good distance from you and the girl. - Oh, naturally. So that automatically makes me the target, I suppose? - You seem more likely than a 22-year-old art student. - She could have had a jealous lover. - With a telescopic sight and flippers? - He's right, you know. It was all planned too professionally. - Do you think it meant was for me? - I don't know. You've both been somewhat active along this coast from time to time. - Well, excuse me, Judge, but whose fault is that? - Uh, something may interest you. - [Danny] What's that? - If you'll forgive the translation. It says "People are wondering whether the shot that hit Mademoiselle Devigne was in fact intended for the playboy du jet set Danny Wilde, pictured above at the Monte Carlo rally." - Nice picture. - You know, Michelle Devigne is really rather attractive. Why do you always look so furtive? (someone knocking) - Hi. Oh, nurse, I've been looking all over for you. (Danny speaking French) In the hallway. I think a patient, le patient. I thought she'd never leave. How are you? - I'm okay. - I got you some flowers. - Thank you. I've been reading about you. - How's your shoulder? - A bit sore. - Well, it could have been worse. It could have been a lot more serious. - Danny Wilde. I find that hard to believe. - Why is that hard to believe? - I've heard about your exploits. Is that the right word? - I don't know if they're exploits. - Was someone really trying to kill you? - Everybody seems to think so, yeah. And you, what do you think? - Well, I'll tell ya, kiddo. It's either me or you. - Me? You must be joking. I'm nobody. Who'd want to shoot me? - So, for his own safety, we must send him away. My Great Uncle Charles runs a safari club in the wilds of Tanzania. It's really quite comfortable. - You believe that bullet was meant for him. - Well, he was a good 18 feet clear of anyone else. No professional sniper makes a six-yard mistake. - If you discount the girl. - You don't? - "Mademoiselle Devigne, who lives with her uncle, one of Monte Carlo's more exclusive jewelers, had been voted the most talented student at the Valeuris Art Centre before her sudden decision to continue her studies in London." - Milord, pray, what is the implication? - "Sudden." "Before her sudden." Why sudden? - Why not? People leave suddenly. Daniel, for instance. - Hmm. Danny doesn't deal in gold. - Are you suggesting that girl is involved in gold trafficking? - I have no evidence to suggest anything, but her uncle is Maurice Devigne, the custom jeweler who specializes in plaques, medals, and gold coins. He was involved in a most interesting case, a clever twisting of the law. Ah! Here, you're taller than I am. A-G, please. - I suppose you're going to tell me what you're talking about. - Devigne sold a gold Napoleon 100-franc piece which turned out to be counterfeit. - I suppose these are your special "declared innocent but guilty and got away with it" files. - Exactly. In Devigne's case, he testified... Now wait a minute, just let's see what he did testify. Yes, here we are. He testified that as he himself was not too sure about the coin, he charged only the market value of the gold itself. - That's not illegal. No. - But selling unauthorized gold is. - Well, of course. But not in the form of coins. - Counterfeit or otherwise? - That's the twist. - Well, what's in the file about the girl? - The girl? Oh, nothing. I know nothing at all about the girl. - There really isn't much to know. I sketch, do clay modeling, a little engraving. Jill of all trades, mistress of none. I lead a very uneventful life, Mr. Wilde. - Oh, I don't know. I think being an artist would be an exciting life. Think of all the beautiful things in the world to see. And you're very good. - And you're putting me on. - No, I'm not. It was a very good ink portrait. - What ink portrait? - The one I saw at the airport. Water? - Thank you. I'd really much rather talk about you. You're far more interesting. Are the things I hear about you true? - Don't believe everything you hear or read. Now, who was the guy? - Who was who? - Look, the guy. The one in the sketchbook, the one with the goatee beard. - Ever seen a gold Napoleon? - No, but I knew someday you would show me one. - Beautiful, isn't it? It's counterfeit. - Really? Valueless to a collector, but literally worth its weight in gold. - Which is why hundreds of them periodically turn up in Paris, Rome, Geneva, and Beirut. - Yes, it sounds like a wonderful way of unloading stolen bullion. - Precisely. Devigne has neither the courage nor the capacity to be involved in that, but he might be used. - As a funnel. As a funnel for something so big, that they'd even kill to keep it going. - It's worthwhile exploring. In which case, the key would be. - Monsieur Devigne. - Uncle! - Oh, Michelle. I just heard. I came as soon as- - Careful! - What happened? Is it serious? - No, nothing. I'm all right. - Hi. - [Michelle] This is Mr. Wilde. My uncle, Mr. Devigne. - Enchante. I was just keeping her company until you arrived. Goodbye. - Why, why did you run away? Why? - I trusted in you. I believed you. - You went to the foundry? - Of course I did. - If you had come to me, I would have explained. - Explained what? That those molds I was making for you of the Napoleon coin weren't for bronze replicas? - Michelle, look at my hands. I can no longer do this work myself. I had to ask you to make those molds. - You still have the shop. - No. It isn't mine any more. Not even that. - Why not? What have you done with it? - I had no choice. A syndicate came, offered to take over. - Syndicate? Uncle, what on earth are you involved in? - I cannot tell you. Please, please don't ask me any more questions, if you don't want me to rot for the rest of my life in jail. - You lied to me! You said you'd learned your lesson the first time you were arrested! I saw the kind of lesson you learned. Gold! You were minting gold coins, not bronze! Don't lie to me again, Uncle, I saw it! - And someone saw you. Don't you understand? They saw you run from the foundry. Saw you buy an air ticket. - Who? - They panicked, thought you would cause trouble. They had to stop you. - So it was me. The bullet was meant for me. - They tried to kill her, Pullicino. They tried to kill my niece. - What a terrible thing. I was away, you know that. They will be adequately punished, believe me. - If anyone so much as touches her again, Pullicino- - Dear Devigne, I know exactly how you feel. l-I'm horrified. - Did you really think that she would talk? About what? All she knows is that I am involved. She does not know you even exist. - We will try and keep it that way, eh, Devigne? You came to promise she will make no more foolish moves, am I not right? - Of course. - Excellent, excellent. You'll keep your side of the bargain, Pullicino keeps his. The girl keeps her mouth shut and stays in one place. Now, you go back to your shop in comfort, eh, knowing all will be well. Goodbye, goodbye. - Papa! Papa, look at me. - So, you arranged to have the girl killed, eh? What kind of primitive animal are you? - Somebody had to make a decision. - So you did? A blind, panicked decision that's made her the center of interest for every policeman and pressman on the Riviera. - That's not true, not any more. - We're moving two and a half billion dollars of gold through that old man. I give you a solemn warning, Vernier, if what you did jeopardizes our operation, your family can start lighting candles for you. - I did a jump! I just did a jump! - Isn't that something, eh? How high did you jump, my little cowgirl? - Ooh, high. And I'm going to do it again. Watch me. - I'm watching, I'm watching, Cara. - The police aren't interested in the girl any more. They think the shot was meant for someone else. - Mr. Danny Wilde? I also read the papers, Vernier. They must do more than think it was him. They have to be sure. - Give them more evidence, eh? What do you suggest? - Remove any doubt. - So suddenly, I stop and I ask myself, what do I care if this girl is acting strange? Who am I, Sherlock Holmes? I'm Danny Wilde, with my own problems in London. So after lunch, which I'm gonna let you buy me, it's gonna be up, up and away, even if I have to charter a plane on my own. - Have you finished? - Yeah, completely. - Well, if the judge's theory is correct, the bullet could have been meant for the girl after all. - I've got news for you, my lord. I don't care if that bullet was marked "his" or "hers". - I admire your gallantry. - Furthermore, Judge Fulton can take his assurances and- - Un Americano. - Oui, monsieur? - Americano. What do you want to drink? - Oh, yeah. A lemonade. - A lemonade? - Yes. - That girl really did something to you. - That girl didn't do anything to me. - Maybe you weren't her type. - How does a mind like yours get so decadent? - It's hereditary. You know, if she lives with her uncle and her uncle is part of this Napoleon racket, then they're also mixed up with some less than lovable characters. People with nasty little habits like picking off other people at airports. - Bully for them. Merci. - Cheers. If you can say cheers with a thing like that. - Do you wanna test this and see if it's poisoned? (tires squealing) So it's the girl they're after, huh? - I promise you, you'll be very happy in Tanzania, Daniel. Oh, it's a little primitive, I'll admit, but my uncle, the Viscount Chesterfield, is an excellent host. Who knows? He may actually help you catch a wildebeest. Wilde. - Yeah, I get it. Nobody's gonna aim his dirty car at me and get away with it. You want me out of this country, you're gonna have to deport me. - There is a plane leaving for London in half an hour. - Have a nice trip. - I suggest you have something to eat. You know, there's open-faced sandwiches- - Hey, wait a minute, you know what I think I'm gonna try to do? I'm gonna trace that car. - Oh, that should be easy. There can't be more than 2,000 in the south of France. - This one's got a busted fender. - That does limit the field to, oh, a thousand. Tanzania. - You keep saying "Tanzania". I'm not going to Tanzania. I'm gonna stay here and find that car. - I wish you'd make up your mind. One minute you want to go, the next minute you want to stay and chase untraceable cars. He was probably trying to ambush you in the first place. - What are you so worried about me for? - Well, perhaps I'd rather hate you alive than dead. - Well, I wish you'd make up your mind. At the airport you tell me that it's me they're after. When we get to the cafe, you tell me it's the girl they're after. Now they're after me again. Make up your mind. - They're gunning for both of you. Would you send somebody up for Mr. Wilde's bag? - What do you mean both of us? I just said hello to the girl. We're not Bonnie and Clyde, you know. I don't understand you. I don't understand you. - "The British and Americans, two people separated by a common language." - See what I mean? I don't understand you. - That's a quote from another Wilde. - You wanna do me a favor? - Hm? - Don't do me any more favors. - In that case, who's gonna pay for lunch? - I didn't have any lunch, you had lunch. - But you ordered it. - What're you talking- - We'll settle the argument. We'll toss for it. - All right, toss. - Call. - Heads. - Oh, heads! Aren't you lucky? You win. - Hey, wait a minute! That's the guy! That's the guy. - That's Napoleon III. - Yeah, but that's the guy in the sketch, Michelle's sketchbook. You know, the sketch she made. That's the guy she made the sketch of. - [Fulton] A most interesting speculation. - She's just a young aspiring artist working for her uncle sketching coins, that's all. - One casts coins. These casts are then reduced on an engraving machine and made into a steel die, which in turn punches out the coins. - Did you just make that up? - Pearls before swine. May I? - Of course. And good luck. - Toodle-oo. - Now where are you going? - Prospecting. (mellow music) - Bonjour, monsieur. - Guten Tag. We are interested in your coins. - Ah, coins. And what sort of coins have you in mind, monsieur? - The best. We are interested only in the best. Mein late father, General von Graumann, would always say, "Less than the best is not best enough." It does not translate well. The coins, bitte. - We have a varied selection. From these superb gold ones, several in almost mint condition, to some extremely rare silver specimens. And we ourselves mint a very fine bronze reproduction of the popular 100-franc gold Napoleon III. - Like this one, ja? - Yes, a particularly fine specimen. - Ja, but we ask ourselves, it is genuine or is it counterfeit? - Pardon, monsieur? - We understand that there are many good copies around. - There are indeed. You are quite correct, monsieur. - We von Graumanns always try to be correct. My father general would say, "Any Dummkopf can be incorrect, but not to be a Dummkopf is more correct." (laughing) Is good, ja? It's even better in German. Now, you will tell me the correctness of this coin? - It will be a personal opinion only. - Exactly what we wish. - Yes, the work is good, but it is a copy. It is not genuine. - So, so. But the value? - It is a counterfeit piece. - Jawohl, but the metal is not counterfeit, it is genuine. - Well, in that case. - Ja, in that case? - Well, it weighs an ounce. The market value of the gold alone is a little bit more than $35. - We prefer to speak in Deutschmarks. - I will have to check the currency conversion table. - Or even better, in Reichmarks? - Reichmarks? - Or to be more precise, Reich gold. - I'm afraid I do not understand, monsieur. - Herr Devigne, I am in your trade. Like you, I represent big interests. - I see. - Good. So we will continue this discussion in your office. It will afford more privacy. Aboard? - Please. Gesundheit. (clock chiming) Wunderschern, wunderschern. - Yes, we do have some very beautiful pieces. - I, too, have something very beautiful, Herr Devigne. It is a steel chest my father raised from the depths of the Walchensee in Bavaria. It was part of the famous Reichbank gold convoy that Adolf Hitler tried to move to Switzerland. - Yes, I suppose it has a certain curiosity value. - Ah, but what is the value of the gold that is still inside that chest, I ask myself? Zweiundzwanzig solid gold ingots. (bell ringing) - Excuse me, monsieur. - Bitte. (suspenseful music) Working on today's gold quotations, allowing 10%- - I am sorry, monsieur. I cannot help you further in the matter. - I was instructed you were the person to contact. - Well, I don't know who could have told you that, monsieur. - In our trade, we do not disclose names, Herr Devigne. - Of course. But the simple fact is that we do not buy gold in bulk, whatever its source, Herr Graumann. - Von Graumann. I will contact you again in, say, 24 hours. - I'm sorry. It will just be a waste of time. - Mein father general always said "It's never a waste of time, if some of the time has not been wasted." Witty man, my father, huh? Auf Wiedersehen. (suspenseful music) - All right, you're this girl, right? You see or hear something that you shouldn't, so you want out. - A large warehouse, a factory. Some place that's been out of business until recently. Yes, yes, of course I'll wait. - So that's what you do. But somebody doesn't want you out, so they try to stop you. A near miss. - Yes? Splendid! Who is the actual owner of the company? - Now here you are lying in the hospital, afraid for your life, and you clam up. Why? - Oh, he does, does he? Tell me, where is this place? Could you let me have the address? - Why doesn't she just go to the police and spill everything she knows? - I don't know. - I'll tell you why. She's got an uncle that she loves very much that's in it up to his gold Napoleons, that's why. - Yes, yes, I'm ready. - Now here's the switch. All of a sudden she gets too hot to handle, so they gotta take the heat off. - I'm most grateful. - So they take it off and they put the heat on me. Meanwhile the fuzz is busy with me, they're up in the mountains making these gold Nappies, huh? It's probably in a stone quarry, or a warehouse. - How about an abandoned foundry that's suddenly sprung to life? - Abandoned. Yeah, not a bad idea. - It's up in the Haute Province. (lively music) (lively music continues) (lively music continues) (suspenseful music) (suspenseful music continues) (suspenseful music continues) (water running) (Danny whistling) (coins clanking) - All right. Finish for the night. (phone ringing) Yes? D'accord. - That was the main gate. Devigne just drove through. - What are you doing here? - Something came up. It could be something big. There was a man in the shop, Herr von Graumann. He says he has got his hands on the Walchensee gold, all the ingots the Nazis hid. - What? - It could be a fortune, Pullicino. He just came to me with a proposition. If it is true- - What were you doing with him, huh? Huh? - Who? - Sinclair! - I don't know any Sinclair! - Don't lie to me! I saw him drive away from your shop. - The only one who came in was von Graumann with his proposition. - I can imagine the proposition. He's Danny Wilde's friend. I followed him. I know! - Let him go. What's on your mind, old man? - Nothing. Nothing, I am telling you. A man came, he has a German accent, he offers this deal. - You have betrayed us, old man. - No, no. (dramatic music) - Devigne! He's dead. - So is our control over that girl. We better get to the hospital and silence her for good. Come. - Hey! (gun firing) (pipes clanging) (lively music) (tires squealing) - Run him down. (suspenseful music) (gun firing) There's no more time. We must head for the hospital and get that girl. (suspenseful music) (tires squealing) (engine revving) (tires squealing) (tires squealing) Wait here, watch his car. - Visiting hours are over! - Yes, I know, but this is very urgent. - No one has been up through here. Visiting hours are finished. - Yes, yes, of course. Now, if I may I see Michelle? - Certainly. - I don't wish to upset her by mentioning that I'm coming. - No, of course not. - Danny! - Shh, shh! - What are you doing here? - Ssh! Come on. - No, tell me. - Shh! I'll explain everything later. - Vernier! The fire escape! (suspenseful music) - Put your hands up. Just put your hands up. - Bertrand! - Now where, wait a minute! (suspenseful music) - Are you sure, Commandant? I see. Yes, very well, Commandant. I'll tell him immediately. I apologize for the trouble. - May I ask you something? What are you apologizing about, huh? What is it? - Oh, wine! Where's Michelle? - She'll be down in a minute, she said. - Any luck? - All bad. - Oh, wish I hadn't asked. - The police have been to the foundry, but the birds had flown. No body, no truck, no packing cases, no coins. So the police commandant is sending an escort here to make sure the American troublemaker is on the next plane. - [Brett] Bon voyage. - Well, I told you what I saw. - Oh, I believe you. I know this Pullicino. He's been implicated in every major theft in Europe. I've wanted to see him behind bars for years, but he cannot be convicted without positive proof. - What about the shipping manifesto, the one you lifted from the foundry? Six crates of bronze coins, destination Genoa. It's perfectly legitimate. - Oh, come in, my dear. Go and sit down. Have a cup of coffee. - Thank you. - Wasn't there anything else? Anything? Some tangible evidence? - Hey, wait a minute. What about this coin? I clipped it from one of the packs. - Hm. It's exactly what their manifest states. A replica of the Napoleon in bronze. - There were others, in gold. I was there. I saw them minting gold coins. - From the Napoleon molds you made for your uncle. - I didn't know. I didn't know about Pullicino. The only reason I went to the airport was to get away. - So it was you they were trying to kill. - Yes. But it was my uncle they destroyed. If it hadn't been for them, he would've- - Yes, I know, my dear, but there's no proof that they were doing anything illegal. - Daniel. - Hm? - When you got there, were the crates already packed? - Almost packed, yes. - Perhaps they sandwiched the gold between layers of bronze. - "Perhaps" is not a legal term. If you stop them and find nothing wrong, you're in trouble. - We're always in trouble. I think we oughta check that out, kiddo. - Before you go off half-cocked, Daniel, they've got a half hour start. - So? - Well, after Monte Carlo, there are two roads they can take into Italy. The lower coast road or the new autostrada. - Fine. We got two cars, right? You take the lower and I'll take the outer. - Ooh, there's a song there somewhere. - I'm going with you. - You're not going any- (door buzzing) - The gendarmerie, your escort. Now go out the back way. - Wait a minute. I'm not taking any wounded girl in my red Ferrari. - If you don't take me with you, I'll scream. - It's not a bad idea anyway. Because if you are stopped, at least she can corroborate your story. (door buzzing) - I'm coming. (suspenseful music) - Hello, Mayfair? Hello, come in, please. Hello? - Yes, Bronx, I read you. - It's not Daniel, it's Michelle. Have you seen any trucks? - Not yet. Where are you? - Eze. Outside of Eze. - We're just outside Eze. - Eze? You're three miles behind me. You remember that little white number that spilt your lemonade? - Yeah, sure, what about it? Ask him that. - He says "Sure, what about it?" - It's been tailing me for the last three miles. - That's Sinclair's car up ahead. - Well, we can be sure Mr. Wilde is covering the other route. Don't lose him. - Hello, Bronx, are you reading me? - Yeah, we're reading. - I'm here. - [Brett] I'm stuck between the border gendarmerie and the lemonade spillers. How about you? - We're in sunny Italy. - The van just passed through customs about six cars ahead of me. You better cover my road and keep tabs. - Get in his car. Keep his mouth shut. (tires squealing) (border guard shouting in French) - I don't suppose you'll believe me if I told you that the van that just passed through was carrying $2 million worth of gold? - I'm sorry, sir, but you must use the other lane. - All right, well, I'll tell you the truth. My grandmother's 100 years old today. (speaking French) She's flying to Rome to have a little dolce vita before she finally passes on. But if I'm not there to help her off the plane, she may fall, break a leg, and miss the whole thing. (border guard speaking French) (Brett speaking French) (car horn honking) - There's the slip road. - Cute. (tires squealing) (horn honking) - Now, look, I was just telling this young lady that- (Danny groaning) Wait. Put me down. Thanks. Ow! (tires squealing) Next! - You big- - I've something to tell you. Put me down! - Here, put my friends down! - Put him- - That's better. All you have to do is be reasonable, Daniel. - You should have asked me. Hey, Peter Pan, come here. I want to talk to you. I just thought of something. - You see, Daniel? When I punch them, they stay down. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Right, come on. (engine starting) (horns honking) - Sunday driver! - I just had a horrible thought. - Really? What? - Yeah. We'd better be right about this smuggling or we're gonna be in trouble. - Look, I'm telling you. I know those coins are gold. (Brett whistling) Could I ask you something? What do you know about Italian jails? - Nothing, but I prefer French cooking anyway. - After them. (tires squealing) (horns honking) (suspenseful music) - Is that them? - That's them. Oh, His Lordship's gonna love this. (tires squealing) (horns honking) (gun firing) (horns honking) (suspenseful music) (gun firing) Hold on, now. (guard shouting in Italian) (siren blaring) - Get the driver. - All right, pal, what's going on? - Daniel, there's something you ought to know. - Arrest them! - What are you talking about? Let go! Now look, I've been shot at. People have aimed cars at me. They've been trying to hit me in the- (tires squealing) Now look, I wanna- - Arrest them! Arrest them! - They're hijackers, they stole this camion! - Who owns this machine? - Who are you? - Chief of Police. - He owns this machine, that guy right there. And those two guys behind him, they've been shooting at us all along the autostrada. - Yes, of course we did. They were stealing my camion. I've a right to protect my cargo. - He's a gold smuggler. - Daniel. - What? - Daniel, Daniel, please take notice of me. - How dare you! I will sue you for defamation of character. - Go ahead. - What about this gold smuggling? - No gold! Bronze copies of the Napoleon coin! Gold? - Gold. - Bronze. - I'm telling you they're gold. - Bronze! - They are thieves of the worst kind! I demand you put them under arrest! - Please do not tell me what to do, monsieur. - Now look, feel the difference. This is gold and this is bronze. - They've been dipped. - What did I tell you? - Daniel, I apologize. What else can I say, except I'm not used to handling coins. They make holes in one's pockets. - I've a legitimate shipment of bronze coins. - Right. Tell them, both of you. - [Brett and Michelle] Gold! Gold. - Here you are, sir. Examine that, please. - Arrest these men. - Oh, do you know my friend? This is Pullicino. - You'll forgive me if I don't shake hands. - Oh, you sure hit hard. - Not really, just about 10 Napoleons worth. (upbeat music) - Merci. Which one of you is Lord Brett Sinclair? - I am, yes. - If you believe that you'll believe anything. - A message from Judge Fulton. - Telephone him back and tell him we don't need any. - Apparently, it is he who needs you. Au revoir, monsieur. - What is it? - The good judge has been arrested. - What for? - For interfering with the police in the course of their duties. - Well, that'll teach him. What do you think we oughta do? - I suppose we could bail him out. - Yeah, we could. Tell you what, why don't you think about it? Michelle and I are gonna have dinner. - Yes. I have the money! - Come on, I'll tell you what we'll do. - Daniel! - What? - The dinner money. - Oh, here comes a car. Smiles. Bonjour! Ah, you... How about a little ride, pal? What do you say, huh? It's not my fault! (suspenseful music)
