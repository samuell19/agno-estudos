Hey, you're lookin' good. - Nice suit. - Thanks. What are you, uh, doin'? Well, I thought you might like me to pack your things for you. I appreciate that. It will save me at least some money. I'm gonna miss you, you know that? Yeah, and you'll find another champion. You've a nose for it, so.. No. There’ll never be another you. Hey, Rick, tell us you're gonna fight Denard again, huh? Uh, no, but I got a better one for you. (male #1) ’What’s the matter, he too tough for you?’ (male #2) 'It's good to see some familiar faces out there. 'Normally, I drag you all away from your desks' 'to give you some good news.' Unfortunately, that is not the case today. Today we are losing someone who has done more for the sport of kickboxing than anyone I know. ’A person who has overcome many obstacles’ both personal and professional. A fighter in every sense of the word. A true champion. It is with a mixture of sorrow and joy that I formally announce the retirement from competition 'of Rick Quinn.' What do you think Denard’s reaction’s gonna be, heh? I don't care. I'm going to kill that son of a bitch. I'm going to fucking kill him! What the hell is goin' on here? He owes me the fight! He owes me the belt! Rick! You piece of shit. What do you want, Denard? Why don't you get off my property? It says back there you sold it. Oh, you can read. Listen. You owe me the belt, Quinn. You owe me one last fight. I don't owe you anything. If you want the belt, go beat the number three contender if you can. No, I'm going to beat you, motherfucker. You shut your foul mouth. You hit the road. Look, I don't need this shit. Don't turn your back on me! [gunshot] Stop it! Get out of here! Get out! We're going to have that last fight. You better believe it. Are you alright? You scared the hell outta me. [instrumental music] [laughing] So, did you hear the one about the Irish kickboxer, eh? He kicked himself to death. [laughs] Enjoy yourselves. 'We'll be back with you in a short while.' I believe you just made yourself a killing on the last one, major. Eh? Oh, splendid. This is a private party, pal. Sure, I've got an invitation right here. - Take a walk, asshole. - Hey, no problem. (male #3) 'Ladies and gentlemen.' Ladies and gentlemen, the fourth bout of this evening will shortly be taking place. Lay your bets now. Even money on The Prince. 2-1 on Sayan. We are gonna lose about 150 grand if The Prince wins. I can handle that. You bet you can. Ladies and gentlemen, here they come. The Prince and Sayan. Give them a big hand. [applause] 'Here they come.' Okay, boys, the rules are, have no mercy.. Why don't you make a bet, Angelica? What for? Perhaps you'll win. Is that going to make me feel better? Oh, yeah. I doubt it. [crowd cheering] Okay, boys, when you hear the bell, come out fightin'. [bell dings] [audience cheering] Yes! Yeah, yeah! Yeah! [bell dings] - Back! - Ah! I said get back! Go! - Move! Go! - Ah! One, two, three four, five, six seven.. ...eight nine ten! Out! [audience cheering] Oh, Dominique. Please? He deserves nothing. [dramatic music] [gunshot] What about this fellow, Rick Quinn? He's in his prime. The odds will be too short. Hmm. Yeah. But what if, Rog.. ...what if we change the format a little? Say.. ...four fights. Knockout competition. Winner stays in the ring. That's not a bad idea. Each time he gets hurt, the odds go up. We can make a crock of money. Serious money, Rog. Serious money. A little novelty to keep the punters’ interest. Set up a meeting. (male #4) 'Hey, uh, Roger.' Hi. I'm the voice on the telephone. Roger. Glad to meet you. This is my wife, Carol. It's a pleasure. Please come this way. I'd like to introduce you to my half-brother Dominique Le Braque. Rick Quinn. It's a unique pleasure. - This is my wife, Carol. - How do you do? And this is, uh, Mrs. Le Braque. Please come this way. 'Take a seat.' - Champagne? - No, thanks. We don’t drink. - You're still in training? - No, not exactly. L'chaim to our mutual benefit. Which is what? I like that. I like that in a man. Decisiveness. It makes for a good warrior. 'Don't you agree?' Now, the offer is simple. I will pay you $50,000 for one evening. Two hours' work. And now, you are gonna ask me what is the nature of this work. Roger. Dominique conducts private fight nights for the elite. Bouts are strictly confidential and-- I'm a little confused here. I thought I told you I no longer fight professionally. It's not professional, it's private. Fighting for money’s professional, gentlemen. Sorry, you're wasting your time and mine. Shall we go? Whoa, whoa. What are you doin'? - Seventy-five. - Thanks, but no, thanks. - One hundred thousand dollars. - What, are you deaf or what? Hey, we're gonna sit down, we're gonna have a drink we're gonna eat some cashew nut and shrimp, man. - Who the hell is this? - We can negotiate. - Get him out of my way. - Tony, back off. We'll meet again, Mr. Quinn. Did I tell you your hair looks lovely? I forget. I just came to say goodbye. Whoa! Maybe I should take a picture. This is it. Quinn and wife leave. - Hi, Carol. - Hi. We're gonna miss you. Yeah, I’m sure like a hole in the head. I'll tell you one thing though. Kickboxing's gonna miss you. God help us if Denard becomes the champ he's gonna run this game to the ground. Uh.. Carol, could I talk to Rick alone for a moment? - Sure. - Thanks. What's up? Prince has disappeared. That means the third LA-based fighter in the last couple of months. That's not all. We got a call from a buddy in Thailand. He said seven of his best fighters just recently retired came out to Atlanta on a two-way ticket they never made it home. You know anything about this? No. You know, there was a guy named, uh Le Braque, got a hold of me. He wanted me for a private bout. Big money. Nah, that’s different. He runs his gambling gigs. You know, it's invitation only. This is completely different. These guys have disappeared, Rick. I hear there's big money in Germany. Maybe they're there. - Some gypsy's game. - Yeah, maybe. - Can I have the keys, honey? - Yeah. - Can you get that? - Sure. - Okay. - I'll just be five minutes. - Okay? - Keep in touch. If I don't see you again, have a good trip, okay? Well, we’ll give you a call when we’re settled in and then you can visit. Jesus, spare us, honey. Oh, well, thanks a lot. You really know how to make a guy feel good, huh? [explosion] [intense music] Carol! Carol! 'Somebody, help!' Somebody, help me! No! No! [sobbing] [baby crying] (man on TV) 'Hallelujah!' Hallelujah! Hallelujah! Jesus is Lord. Jesus is the only king. 'This is the only book. This is the only truth.' 'Throw all other books away.' 'You sinners. You sinners out there' 'you better go down on your knees and pray' 'and say, "Oh, Lord, Lord, forgive me.."' Hey! You want me to have your things thrown out the back? (man on TV) 'When the devil gets hold of you' 'and grabs you by the throat' 'and throws you into the eternal flame..' Reporter was around here askin’ for ya. Guy by the name of, uh.. ...W-Willard. Talkative son of a bitch. What'd you tell him? Yeah, yeah. I've never seen you before. I don't know who you are. My baby. I’ll tell ya, it was a baby girl. - The-- - Hey. Hey, hey. Hey, hey. That's over with, that's done with. Look at me. Huh? You gotta start living again. You understand that? No, you, you don't understand. It was a baby girl. The coroner told me it was a baby girl. He killed her! Would you just get out of my life, huh? Yeah. You got it. Hi, gorgeous. Got 50 bucks for a quick hand job? - Get out! - Whoa! Oh! [cat meows] [laughing] Where is he? I know you fucking know. Take your fucking hands off me. - Where? - Okay, Jesus Christ, let go. I'm all ears. Where? He's not fighting anymore. I don't know why you want him. He’s so far gone and he’s helpless. He's telling people I killed his wife. And I’m going to shut his mouth for him, forever. Willard was right. You look like shit. I was wondering when you were gonna show. You've been doing a lot of talking about me, Quinn. And I don't like it. You put that bomb in my car, Denard. I know you did it. Am I supposed to take you seriously? Yeah, but this was serious. - Thanks. - Hey, what the hell, man? [dramatic music] Let’s get outta here. Come on, come on. Denard! [glass shatters] [grunting] [siren wailing] (male #5) ’Quinn? You got bail, boy.’ Dominique asked me to pick you up. Paid your bail. Just wants to talk to you. You don't say much, do you? [snorts] ’Get out the car.’ Get out. I thought you said he wanted to see me. I'll tell him you declined. Maybe that's not such a good idea. He paid my bail. I don't like having debts. Okay. Have it your way. [dramatic music] (male #6) This contract, this contract means nothin', man. I’ll tell you what I want, alright? I want you to cut down on the back end come up with some better percentage otherwise we're gonna get into some serious bad mood. (Dominique) Ah, Angelica. Mr. Quinn, do come and join us. If you gentlemen will come into my property study, finalize all the details. I-I hate all that stuff. Mr. Quinn. I hope you're not, uh, offended by my...charity. All depends on what you mean by charity. [chuckles] I guess so. What would you like to drink? Scotch, rocks. (Dominique) 'Angelica, please.' 'Sit down, Mr. Quinn. Sit, sit.' Better still, before we start why don't you disrobe and jump in the pool? [scoffs] Now? Frankly, Mr. Quinn, you smell. Angelica, why don't you go upstairs and find Mr. Quinn something clean to wear for after his swim? Then we can all enjoy a little luncheon and discuss your current predicament. You're crazy, you know that? I do believe I am. Enjoy yourself, Mr. Quinn. You’re gonna make me a lotta money, Mr. Quinn. And I am gonna make you a rich man.. ...if you're as good as I hear you are. [splash] (Rick) ’So, where do these fights take place?’ (Dominique) 'Oh, different venues.' ’We had one in the desert a couple months back.’ 'Very exciting.' 'Chilly but quite unique.' 'Unfortunately, I have to be rather discreet about..' '...where and when.' ’The gambling laws in the state are archaic, to say the least.’ Perhaps you should slow down on that chardonnay. You only have one week to get back in shape. Look, Mr. Le Braque. I'll fight for you, but don't tell me how to behave, okay? You are in my house. I can always go back to my hotel. Look, don't worry about me. I'll be ready. - Who's my opponent? - I'm not sure yet. There will be four fights. If you win the first, you'll be in the second. If you win that, you'll be in the third. If you win that, you'll be in the final. It's a knockout competition. You'll get 10,000 for each fight. So, if you stay on your feet you could do quite well for yourself. Stop pickin' at your food. Eat it! Excuse me. Excuse me. - 'Where are you going?' - I have a slight headache. She's a beautiful woman, don't you think? (Rick) 'Yes.' I found her in the gutter like I found you. But then I like to take things that are ugly and turn them into things of beauty. I love boxing. 'There's nothing that gives me a greater thrill' 'than to see grown men trying to kill each other.' You must make yourself comfortable here, Mr. Quinn. There is a training area at the bottom of the garden which I'm sure you'll find very useful. Now, if you'll excuse me I have a horse running in the sixth at Hollywood Park. 'A vital thing, Mr. Quinn.' Whatever happens between us is totally confidential. Betray my trust and even I can turn extremely ugly. [heavy breathing] Not bad. Not bad. How you feeling? - Oh, could be worse, I guess. - Yeah. You've met Tony before, haven't you? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yes. Dominique thought you might like some company. Two of you workout together, alright? - Sure. - Yeah, you bet. You, uh, you boys have some fun now, alright. Pow-pow. Okay, Mr. World Champion.. ...let's see what you got, huh? [grunts] [chuckles] I'm really impressed. Come on. [grunts] You wouldn't last a half a round with a fairy never mind the boys you goin’ up against. Tomorrow mornin’ on the terrace. Before breakfast. Yeah. [dramatic music] I'm sorry-- I didn't see you standing there. We should start this over again. I brought you some dinner. 'Dominique asked me to apologize.' 'Uh, he had to go out.' ’If there is anything else you need’ 'the intercom is over there.' - 'You just press it and, um..' - Okay. - Goodnight. - Wait. 'These, uh, fights..' '...what's in it for Dominique?' What's in it? Oh, I don't know. It satisfies his morbid curiosity with destruction, I guess. No, it's, it's just business. Um, his gambling clients pay him half a million dollar membership fee. That's serious money. So is the fighting, Mr. Quinn. You should never have come here. - I should never have let you. - 'Wait.' (Tony) Come on. Pick up the pace. Work up a sweat. Hey. Hey! Come on, work up a sweat. Hey, hey, ballerina boy. Come on. Yeah, surprise, surprise. Uppercuts. That's it. Not bad, not bad. Well done, buddy. [grunts] I think that, uh, might be considered a foul. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. Well, that's the kind of fightin' you're gonna be doin'. - Isn't that right? - So you better get used to it. [groans] You're gonna die. And I'm gonna do the killin'. [groaning] You're all nuts. Every one of you. How do you open this thing, guys? You don't, not unless Mr. Le Braque or Roger says so. I wanna do some road work, come on. Too bad. Jesus Christ. (Rick) 'Where's your husband?' - He's not here. - I wanna go for a run. The goon with the shotgun says he's gotta wait for an okay 'before he opens up the damn gate.' That's correct. Dominique's not here. - He won’t be back till Friday. - Well, where is he? He's in Europe on business. Anything else? 'Yeah, why don't you tell the guy?' [chuckles] They don't listen to me. You'll just have to wait until Roger gets back from wherever he is. What is this? Am I some sort of prisoner here? Yes. Just like me. Christ. Oh, he's rich. There was a time when I thought that was all that mattered. But he's so rich that if I ever leave him he'll find me, no matter where I am and bring me back. Sounds like you've tried it before. That woman you were with in the restaurant the first time I met you she your wife? Yeah, she was. - You don't mind me asking? - She's dead. - She was murdered. - Oh. How? It, uh, really doesn't matter, does it? You really loved her. Yeah. Why do you say that? I don't know. Do you blame yourself for her death? You should learn to be kind to yourself, Mr. Quinn. Like you? Hmm? Oh, I don't punish myself for what I am or what I thought I should’ve been. You do. What about that shit you shove up your nose and the drink? It keeps me sane. Call for downstairs. Kiss me. Kiss me. Jesus Christ. Kiss me. Kiss me. Again. Again. [dramatic music] (Roger) 'I beg your pardon?' Angelica, Dominique is on the phone for you in the study. Go! 'Don't shit where you eat.' 'You're his guest here.' Enjoy your dinner, huh? [door opens] This is crazy. I must apologize for my behavior at dinner. You must go away. Don't fight. I can’t tell you why.. ...but you must leave. Dominique's coming back soon. Good shot. Archery is one of the few sports shared by East and West. I think because of its purity. Like stick fighting, sword fighting, and kickboxing. I believe you and Angelica got on rather well while I was away. That's nice. If you touch her I'll fry your balls and broil your dick, Rick. That's a joke, I think. Now, when you fight tomorrow.. ...make it look bad in the third. Make it look as though you won't last the fourth. Then when you win the fourth I'll give you a $20,000 bonus. - Deal? - I'll do my best. You'll do better than your best. You'll amaze yourself. And you'll amaze me. [inhales] Hmm. [instrumental music] [laughs] I'm just gonna have a last word with your boyfriend. [laughs] Just kidding. Thank you, ladies and gentleman. Now, a big hand for our four sluts from San Diego! Oh! Beauty! Lovely! Lovely! [indistinct chatter] Rick, I wish you luck. But if anything out of the, uh, ordinary should happen, uh roll with the punches, as they say. - What? - Whatever. Five minutes. Where are the other fighters? [exhales] Well, we keep 'em all locked up in case they run away. Some of them get real scared. Is he my second? I’m the fuckin’ referee, asshole. [laughs] [laughs] [indistinct chatter] - Did you tell him? - Don't be a fool. He won't fight if he knows. Anyway, I can't wait to see the look on his face Go tell some stupid jokes. Start the betting. Tell me the truth. Did you fuck him? No. What did the ninja say to the kickboxer? Sayonara, Yaki-Taki Laki-Saki. [laughs] What did the kickboxer say back to the ninja? Go fuck yourself, too, asshole! [laughs] Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to the grandest most spectacular of all our fights. The ex-middleweight champion of the world, Mr. Rick Quinn who fights some knockout competition in the middleweight division. Here they come, ladies and gentlemen. Mr. Rick Quinn. What are the guns for? Don't worry about it. They're with us. Don't upset me, please. If Quinn wins, we got all 200, huh? I know, I know, I know. Wait until the last fight. [bell dings] [audience cheering] [dramatic music] [audience cheering] [grunting] [grunting] [grunting] [grunting] Knock him down! Hoorah! One, two, three four, five'' six, seven, eight, nine, ten. [audience cheering] [gunshot] To the death, Mr. Quinn. You’re out of your fuckin’ mind! You’re out of your fuckin’ mind! Get ready for the next fight, Rick. (male #3) The next fighter up against the champ is the Russian. Ex-KGB assassin Trokovsky. You get 2-1 on him, 7-10 on Quinn. Place your bets, ladies and gentlemen. [audience cheering] Ah, there he is the Russian KGB assassin, Trokovsky! I won't do it. - I won't fight. - 'You wanna bet, Rick?' (male #7) 'You'll do it, baby. You'll do it good.' (male #3) 'Come on, Rick! Come on, you big donkey.' [audience cheering] Hey! Wait! (male #8) 'Boo! Boo!' 'Stand up! Boo!' One, two, three four, five. 'Here, sniff this if you wanna live.' Come on, take a hit, take a hit! - 'Come on, Rick, come on!' - Eight. Nine. Come on, come on up! Stand up! Fight on. [grunting] One, two, three four, five, six seven, eight, nine.. ...ten, dead! Ha! [gunshot] [audience cheering] [grunting] Remember, win this, you get your bonus. [no audio] [intense music] Dominique, it's enough now. - Fuck him. - You bet your ass. He’ll bleed like a pig. Yeah! Welcome to hell, buddy. [dramatic music] Carol! (Roger) 'Come on, man, you there?' [knock on door] 'Open up.' [knock on door] Ooh, ooh. Not feeling too good today, are we? Thought you might like to know your friend Denard is up next. I wonder if he's as tough as you, huh? Your bonus is included. Take it. You tell your piece of shit brother I don't want his blood money. Now, get the fuck outta here. Don't be a damn fool. Take it. Now, get outta here before I kill you. One thing.. ...you can talk about what happened but you don't have any proof. And if you do talk.. ...well, we'll hunt you down we’ll cut out your fuckin’ heart and we’ll make you eat it. [crash] [dramatic music] Are you crazy? What are you doin’ here? He thinks I'm with my shrink. I had to talk to you. (Angelica) ’So, what are you gonna do?’ (Rick) I'm leaving town tomorrow at 3:00. - I'm going East. - Where? New York? No, Thailand. You could go with me... if you want. He'll kill us both. You don't wanna spend the rest of your life running. I better go. (Willard) Are you sure you're not hallucinating, man? Does this look like I'm hallucinating to you? I'm sorry. What do you want me to do? Get your detective buddies to bust ’em. Look, if this guy is as crazy as you say he is your ass is on the line, too, you know. I'm leaving town today. You just let them know. Denard is next on their list. Denard? Man, I gotta see this. Yeah, they’ll take him right to the fight. They'll have all the proof they need. On second thought, why don't you tell your cop buddies to bust ’em after Denard’s got a hole in his head? That way, we’ll lose two scumbags in one go. You still got a soft spot for him, huh? He killed my wife, man. [grunting] (Denard) 'Hey!' 'Come on!' Looking good, Denard. What the fuck do you want? Oh. Good morning to you too. Look, why don’t you give me a couple minutes? I have something that may interest you. Go screw yourself. Do something intelligent for a change, okay? 'Okay.' I mean, if you don't wanna hear what Rick Quinn said about you and a guy named Le Braque, what can I do, right? Hey, hold on. I'll be one minute. I won't hold my breath. You're fighting for Le Braque, right? That's supposed to be a fucking secret. Well, the fucking secret's out of the bag. Now, I don't know if Rick is crazy or what but he told me just been in a fight with La Braque and he looks like he’s gone ten rounds with you. He wouldn’t last one round with me. That's not the point. According to Rick if you lose at Le Braque’s, you die. Bullshit! He won four fights in one night. Each one of his opponent's got a bullet in the back of the head. I've met the guy. He's straight up. He offered me a deal. 50 grand next week. I kick ass! Yeah, where? I don’t know. I don’t care. They’ll pick me up in a limo. I do the job. What's wrong with this guy? What’s he on, acid, crack? What? He's so freaked out, he's gonna leave town. You know, what you should do? Run a story on him. Champ lost his mind. I just wish it was him I was up against. - Maybe you're right. - Of course, I'm right. - Get the fuck out now! - Hey, what the hell is this? Wham-bam-thank-you-ma'am? Can I use the phone, please? Make it quick. Yello! Is Dominique Le Braque there? [knock on door] Yeah? Who is it? (Angelica) 'It's me.' I read your columns. You're very knowledgeable about the sport. [phone ringing] I like to know what’s goin’ on. Yeah. Excuse me. Yup. Lay me 300,000 on number 4. Now, what exactly did you wanna talk to me about? Oh, for starters, how ’bout Rick Quinn? Well.. ...he took a very nasty blow to the head at my last party. [laughing] Is that what you call it? Can I quote you on that? You're a very stupid asshole, Mr. Willard. [chuckles] Can I quote you on that, too, huh? Sure. [whispers] Dom, we have a major problem. [indistinct whispering] - She still there? - Yeah, you bet. [indistinct whispering] I would’ve killed you if you hadn’t, Roger. Yeah. You'll have to excuse me, Mr. Willard. I have some personal business to attend to. I've gotta go too. Maybe we can continue this later. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. You stay here until I get back. We have some serious talking to do. I don't think so. I think-- Who cares what you think, Mr. Willard? Hey, hey, hey, what's this? This? This is a Colt Python, .357 magnum. Jesus Christ. Look, man, this is kidnapping. - I could have your ass sued. - Sit down. Look, my editor knows I'm here. You're in big trouble, man. Oh, shut up. [Angelica moaning] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [moaning] [dramatic music] [moaning] [Angelica screams] Why, Angelica? Why? Why? Why? Oh, God. I give you everything your heart desires.. ...and this is how you repay me. Mr. Quinn.. ...what did I say to you, Mr. Quinn? (Angelica) ’Dominique, please?’ I said I would fry your balls and broil your dick. Didn't I say that, Rick? Didn't I? [Rick grunting] Stop, you sadistic son of a bitch. [grunting] Tell Roger to bring Angelica. [humming] [instrumental music] [knock on door] Angie. Why do you always wanna hurt Dominique, huh? Now, close the box and come with me. Dom wants you. Come on. - 'Roger?' - 'Hmm.' (Dominique) 'Give me your gun.' Now.. ...you wanna stop it, you do it. You put him out of his misery. Come on. [sobs] No, Dominique, no. Come on, honey, show some mercy. For God's sake, help the poor guy. You can do it, honey. Go on. Be tender. Pull the trigger. Do it for his sake. [dramatic music] [crying] I can't, I can't do it. [sighs] Hurt him. - No. No. - Come on. When you’re quite ready, tell me and it’ll stop. [Rick grunting] - Stop it! - Alright. Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright.. [Rick breathing heavily] You're ready? [sobs] This is just a game to you, isn't it? You know I won't do it. You know I can't. I have faith in you. No, Dominique, I can't play this game of yours. I'm not in it. Maybe if you grew up a little, you'd understand. I didn’t bring you here to gimme a lecture. I want you to kill this person. 'Do it!' [gunshot] Christ! What the fuck do you think you're doing? You think I won't do it? I'll blow you head off, Dominique. - As true as God, I will. - Jesus Christ, no. - Just gimme the gun, honey. - Gimme the word, boss. Put it down. Put it away, you stupid shit. Huh? That’s my wife you’re pointing that gun at, ya dumb fuck. Huh? Sorry, Mr. Le Braque. You say sorry to her. Sorry, Mrs. Le Braque. When are you gonna stop all this? How far do you think you can take it? You know your baby. He never knows when to stop. Now, give me the gun, honey. I should just.. Then why don't you? [sniffles] Because I love you.. ...and I hate you. 'You're my..' '...my angel..' ...my devil. You're my everything, Dominique. I just wanted you to know that. I know that. Give me the gun, sweetie. [Dominique sighs] Whoo. [laughing] You're crazier than I am, you know that? [laughing] Go upstairs. - Whoo. - Are you gonna kill him? Oh, God, I.. I don't know. What do you think I should do with him? I don't know. He's a fighter, let him fight. One day he'll lose. [dramatic music] Yeah. One day he'll lose. You are a smart girl. She's a smart girl, right? She’s smart, but she’s crazy. [laughing] Oh, baby, I-I-I-I just gotta tell you, you know. It’s, it’s just that I’m.. ...I'm still angry with you. Bitch! Now, get upstairs! You always gotta do that? Yes! Yes! Yes, I do! And don’t ever, never, ever point a gun at me again! Now, get upstairs! Dom, Dom, don't do this to yourself. Roger, I mean, did you hear that? Who-who-who the hell does she think she's talking to? I told you, it's all the drugs and the drink. It's driving her crazy. [sighs] I don't know what to do anymore. I have given her everything she, she ever wanted. I mean, what more must I do? It’s women. They all like that. - They can't get enough. - Yeah. That's what makes them good gamblers. Yeah, you bet. I-I never thought of that before. Let this piece of meat hang. Yeow! Ooh-ooh. Come. Come, come, come. [grunts] [dramatic music] Willard. Willard. Willard! [Rick grunting] Oh, shit. [groans] You wanna get me down from here? You got the license plate number of that bus? [groaning] (Dominique) Oh, God. My neck, Tony. She tensed me up. (Tony) 'Yeah, you're knotted, boss.' Mm. What am I gonna do, Roger? (Roger)) 'I think maybe we should close operations for a while.' If that idiot reporter had spoken to anyone we woulda heard about it long ago. Two Thai cops arrived in town yesterday asking questions. Thai cops? [scoffs] Stop worrying. You know Mr. Jensen was heard talking at his club. So? So, I had to get our friends in SoHo to take care of him. Oh, dear. That’s a pity. He was a class punter. I just think we should all take a trip. One of those casino cruises. Let things settle down for a while. I think it'd be really nice if you and Angelica spent a little bit of time alone together. You know, patch things up. Yeah. Maybe you're right. Set it up for after the Denard fight. And get that Dr. Feel Good to take a look at Ricky. - I want him fixed up. - What for? He's going up against Denard. [laughing] Yeah. Put the word out to the punters. The grunge fight of the decade. They'll love it. And what if he wins? [sighs] Either way, he's dead. [moans] [moans] (male #9) ’Okay, doc. This is him.’ (Willard) It's about time you got us out of here. - Shut up. - Who the hell is he? (male #9) 'I said shut up.' Look, if something happens to him it's your ass, you understand? Yeah, yeah, yeah. How is he? He's is in a pretty bad way. Yeah, well, if he was alright, you wouldn't be here now. No, I think he's got fractured ribs. I need to do X-rays. Well, uh.. ...we don't have that kind of thing here. Just give him what ya got. Okay. Give him those. Think he'll be ready in four days' time. Well, he'll go three, maybe four rounds. Magic. (Rick) 'Who-who is that? Ugh.' (Willard) 'I don't know. Some quack.' 'I think they still want you alive' but I got a bad feeling you're going back in the ring again. Quinn, the boss wants to see you. Now! - What about me? - What about you? Don't I get a chance to see him, too, huh? Don't you ever shut up? [kisses] [dramatic music] How are you feeling, Mr. Quinn? There are two things I want to tell you. Tomorrow night you're fighting Denard 'to the death.' 'If you win, you can take that trip to Thailand.' But if you ever so much as look at my wife again.. '...I will hunt you down. and I will kill you.' 'That's number one.' Number two? Denard had nothing to do with your wife's death. That I can promise you. I want you to wear that tomorrow and I want you looking good. You can go now. [sniffing] [grunting] Get him outta here. Well? I fight Denard tomorrow night. Rick, you're in no shape to fight Denard. [scoffs] [sighs] I was wrong about him, about Denard. What do you mean? It was Le Braque that killed my wife. Le Braque? Why? I.. ...turned them down wouldn't accept his blood money. [sighs] He's really crazy. Say anything about me? - No. - Rick. I'm gonna die, right? I think we're both gonna die. [dramatic music] I have some news for you, Mr. Denard. You're fighting Quinn tonight. - Really? - Yeah, really. Just made me a very happy man. I'm going to kill that son of a bitch. Well, you bet your ass you're gonna kill him. Promise me one thing. When you get outta here alive you go get the cops and you come back for me, okay? It's a deal. How do I look? Like a man who's going to a funeral. Just make sure it's not your own. - Okay, Quinn. Let’s go. - Good luck, partner. Who do you really think's gonna win? You are. You're gonna go out there and you're gonna whoop him. And you're gonna do it for me and you. - Now go do it, okay? - Okay. [dramatic music] [crowd cheering] [grunting in distance] [grunting] [crowd cheering] Quinn, am I glad to see you. Good evening, Mr. Quinn. I was just telling Mr. Le Braque what you told Willard. And what did I tell Willard? You know, you lose, you die. [grunting] Now this has got to be your first one, right, Denard? [grunting] [grunting] [bell dings] Break! Corner! What are these guys for? They're here to make sure we don't run away. What do you mean? You don't want to fight? I don't wanna die. Do you? He's joking, right? What do you care? You're gonna win, right? Of course, I'm going to win. So? What are you worried about? (male #10) 'Kill him!' [grunting] One, two.. [crowd cheering] It's over. It's all over. 'Finish!' Take a good look at this, Denard. [gunshot] A rose by any other name, Denard. You sick motherfucker. That's not the deal we had! I'm out! I think you're in. [dramatic music] (male #3) All that blood.. ...looks like a bloody abattoir. Bleh! [laughing] Well, some of you have made a lot of money, haven't you? ’Ha! Did you make enough pennies here?’ Perhaps you gentleman should go and change now. (male #3) 'What did the referee say..' - One thing, Le Braque. - Yes? One day you're gonna die.. ...and when you get to hell I'll be there. - I look forward to it. - Me too. [indistinct chatter] (Roger) 'Okay, boys, let's go.' - I owe you an apology. - For what? Because I know you had nothing to do with my wife's death. It was Le Braque. I'm still going to win. One of us is gonna die tonight. If I win.. ...I'm gonna kill Le Braque. If I lose, you gotta promise me you’ll rip his heart out. Is it a deal? - This is it. - I’m getting outta here alive. Me too. Well, one of your boys is a liar. No more bets, please, ladies and gentlemen. No more bets! Now I hand you over to your referee. The handsome the elegant the truly irreplaceable.. He's also a magician 'cause he makes people disappear! Tony! Everybody, hands! [crowd cheering] Approach. Come on. Okay, boys, no time for small talk. And, you.. ...I told you I was gonna kill ya and I'm a man of words. Okay, boys. Let’s do it. Let’s fall in love. Time to touch and come out dancing. [audience cheering] (male #3) Come on, boys! To the death! Remember? [laughs] [dramatic music] [bell dings] Come on, Denard, let's see some grunge! Let’s crack a skull or two, you.. [laughing] 'Screw him, Denard!' [grunting] [audience cheering] [grunting] Bam, bam, bam! [grunting] Get back! One, two 'three, four' five, six 'seven, eight..' (male #3) Stand up! Stand up! Come on! Fight him! [grunting] [laughing] [audience cheering] [grunting] (Tony) 'Back off!' 'One, two' three, four five, six seven, eight.. On your feet. [grunting] [audience cheering] (Tony) 'One, two' 'three, four' 'five, six' 'seven, eight' nine, ten! 'You're mine, sweetheart!' [crowd cheering] [chanting] Down! Down! Down! Down! Down! Down! Down! Down! [dramatic music] [cocks gun] [gunshot] Jesus Christ, you're doing it again. (Angelica) Tell your men to put their guns down. Do it. This is the limit, Dom. The fuckin’ limit! [dramatic music] Don't do this, baby. Give me an excuse. Anything. (Roger) Angelica, what are you tryin’ to do? Roger, do as she says. Do it, boys. Put the guns down. Go stand against the back wall. Do it! Move! Move! 'This is fuckin' sick.' Take the van, Rick. Go! Come on. Come on. Come on. Shit. Shit. [Rick groans] I've got only one thing to say to you people. Fuck y'all. You are sick. - Angelica. - Go! Just go! Come on, let's go. Come on. Come on, Rick. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. I think we should go home now. What are we going to do now? He'll kill her. I gotta go back. I'm with you. Let's do it. - What are you gonna do-- - Shut up! - What are you gonna do-- - Shut up! Now.. ...this is serious. Now I'm killing you. Dom, I want a decision. I want it now! Alright! Burn everything! Shred everything! Get rid of it! That's what you want! It’s too loose, man. It’s fallin’ apart. The clients, your gamblers they think you’re a fuckin’ joke. In ten minutes, we are outta here. I got a jet at the airport. And damn you, you bitch! Do you know.. ...do you know what you have done to me? You've killed me! [dramatic music] [grunting] God, Dominique, no! [Dominique grunts] Don’t do it! You can start again. [Dominique grunts] - No, Dominique! - Bitch! [grunting] - Agh! - No! [Dominique grunting] No, Dominique! [Dominique groaning] [grunts] - 'No, Dominique!' - 'Fuck you!' - 'Stop it, Dominique!' - 'Why..' [indistinct shouting] [gunshot] [man screams] [cocks gun] [footsteps] [gunshot] [intense music] Well, well, well. 'Mr. Denard.' I think you’re trespassin’. [grunting] [Angelica and Dominique screaming] - You're part of this, bitch! - No! I can't.. You come back here. [Angelica screaming] No, Dominique! No, stop, Dominique! [indistinct shouting] [both scream] [Dominique grunting] [Dominique screams] [Angelica coughing] [Dominique grunts] [Dominique gasps] [Dominique grunts] [grunting] [panting] [crying] [bones cracking] [Angelica coughing] [dramatic music] [Angelica coughing] - Did you kill him? - Yeah. [gasps] You really should pay more attention to detail. Goodnight and goodbye. [grunts] Thanks, buddy. (Willard) 'Denard.' Where's Rick? He's alive. I beat the shit out of him.. ...but he's alive. [mellow music] (Rick) I wanted to bring her flowers, but I thought maybe that wasn't such a good idea. I came to tell her I was leaving. Getting out of LA. Going somewhere, anywhere. I was gonna have to start my life over again and I wanted her to come with me but I didn’t know how to say it. Finally, I just asked. She leaned across and kissed me and said yes.
