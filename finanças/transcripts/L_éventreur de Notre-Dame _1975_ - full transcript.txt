(organ music) (whip cracking) (groaning) (shouting) (screaming) (clanking) (indistinct chatter) (shouting) (groaning) No! (gulping) You’re a monster. The devil has possessed you. (grunting) No! (shouting) (groaning) My sweet, my darling, I love you. Let my love unite our souls. (groaning) Don’t resist. Open your heart to me. (groaning) (groaning continues) (shouting) (groaning) (laughing, applause) (indistinct chatter) (soft music) (music stopping) Okay, Charlie, hold everything for the front page, will you? Got that? Good. -How’s my favorite boss? -Fine, Anna. -Here’s the mail. -Ah, thank you. How did you like the performance last night? I am a great actress. -You’re a what? -I’ve got talent. Talent? What matters to me is the box office tape. Oh, in that case, you should be very happy because we had a hell of a crowd. -Excuse me. -Okay, come on in. -Good morning, Raymond. -Hello, Vogel. -Good morning, young lady. -Morning, sir. Here’s the story you wanted for the next issue -of your magazine. -That’s fine. Very interesting, the torture chambers of the Inquisition. Huh, it’s got punch. The storyline is not so hot, but all of the details are absolutely authentic and some of them are quite extraordinary. My dear Vogel, your humility as a writer is very touching, but you know as well as I do that our readers eat up those sadomasochistic stories of yours. Oh, I don’t invent anything. It’s all based on real-life experience, not my personal experience. Really? You’re a man of science, Mr. Vogel. We must know evil to be able to fight it. They tell me you used to be a priest once. Some people will say anything. Tell me, Vogel, my friend, are you an unfrocked priest or not? What difference does it make? Well, it’s an interesting angle. We could publish a serial: Memoirs of an Unfrocked Priest. We could try it. I’ll let you know. Anyway, I’ll drop in soon. -All right. -Goodbye. A pleasure. Goodbye, Mr. Vogel. Goodbye, Miss Anna. Hmm... (laughing) He really is a weirdy. He scares the pants off me. Don’t be silly, he’s perfectly harmless. It’s nothing but a literary pose. How about a nice little kiss? (moaning) I’m going to scare you, yeah. We’ll organize a real Black Mass. -Really? -Really. -We’ll conjure up the devil. -My god. (moaning) That’s right, we’re going to be needing a girl for the sacrificial victim. How exciting. Mrs. Cartier will be the celebrant. And I’ll go and find a victim at the Beelzebub Club. -Not coming to my place? -Not now. Bad boy, you’re so cruel. (moaning) (organ music) -Oh, please. -No, not here. Yeah, come to my place. Oh, come on. Oh, come on, please. Huh? (giggling) (owl hooting) (clicking) (indistinct chatter) Ah, Rose! Hello. Hello. -You’re late. -Oh, I’ve got news for you. -What is it? -We’ve got to find a sacrifice victim for Saturday. Why do we need somebody else? It’s for a real Black Mass. -How about the crypt? -Oh, the crypt is a good idea. Marina will be there, maybe we can talk her into it. Okay. Speed up and come on. Be right with you. (funky music) -Hi! -Hi! This Black Mass... -How are you? -Hi, Ray. What the hell is a Black Mass anyway? -Hi, honey. Hi! -Oh, well, it’s a lot of fun and all that, you know. You go through the motions of a Black Mass. There’s lots of millionaires, it ends in a gangbang. -Rich girls too? -Plenty. There’s something for every taste, and they are all rich. You can count on making a bundle. Oh, and what exactly am I supposed to do? Oh! Nothing special. Just make it. Only make it with who? Anybody? -You could always try Raymond. -Aw! If you prefer, you can get yourself a girl. There’s no shortage of naked women. (laughing) -Coming? -Uh... I wouldn’t miss it for anything. Okay, then it’s settled. To us. Cheers! (music stopping) (birds chirping) (organ and guitar music) (barking) "Apartments for rent." (music stopping) -Uh, how do you do? -Yes, sir? Do you have an apartment available? Yes, sir, I do. An apartment overlooking the street? Yes, I think so, sir. Thank you. In that case, I’ll take it. Very well, sir. -Your name, please? -Mathis Daniel. Mathis Daniel. (soft music) (sighing) Ooh, I’m worn out. Typical. You’re always tired. Too lazy even to hang up your things. It’s resting that keeps me young. How can you live in a mess like this? Anyhow, that way I can find everything. Very funny. (guitar music) Can I give you a hand? (chuckles) Here, catch. Oopla. Now what? (giggling) -Let’s make love. -Why not? (laughing) -Let’s rehearse for Saturday. -The Black Mass, yes. Our own show. So, how will we do it? Ooh, tell me, Anna. You’ll be the young lover. I’ll be the shy virgin. You’ll wear a long, black cloak. I’ll be carrying a concealed dagger to protect my virtue, so watch out. You’re going to need more than a dagger. Prove it. I surrender. And I’ll take my dagger and caress you very gently. Stroke you with it gently, just enough not to break the skin. And when you are trembling with excitement, I’ll kill you! (laughing) (music stopping) I could use a drink. I’ll join you. Oh, hell, another customer. Good evening. I hope I’m not too late to be served. That’s all right, sir. What’ll you have? -Scotch. -Right away. Any particular brand? Uh, no. Buy me a drink? If you like. Take what you want. Marina, another Scotch. What are you doing out so late? I can’t stand crowded places. It’s sad to be alone. Everything is sad. This place, was it a church once? Who cares what it was? Yes, who cares? Here’s to churches. Look, would you mind coming with me? -Where to? -My place. Gonna be nice to me? Yes, very nice to you. Do you live nearby? Nearby. Let’s go, there’s no time to lose. I’ll just slip into my clothes. (howling) (organ music) Quite a place you’ve got here. It serves my purpose. -Come on. -Hey, what’s the big hurry? Ah, yes. Make yourself at home. (sighing) (music stopping) (speaking Latin) (soft moaning) (clears throat) Where did you go? -Where were you? -I was praying. I pray before anything I do. I have a private chapel. Chapel? Yes, I have a chapel in my house. What’s strange about that? Oh? Nothing, I guess. Only you don’t usually find them in places I go. I’m not surprised, you’re a whore. Hey, go easy. I bet you don’t find many honest, God-fearing men among the customers you associate with. That’s not true. One of my customers once took me to a mass. So piety is not dead yet? It’s not what you think. It was a Black Mass. A Black Mass? Yes, it was an exciting evening. How many times have you been? Not often, a couple of times. It’s a pretty weird experience. Where was it? In Paris, in some cave or other. -Give me the address. -I don’t remember. Now come on. Don’t keep a lady waiting. So you’re in a hurry. No, but if you want me to stay, we ought to talk a little business. Ouch. I’ll pay. If you like, I’ll stay with you until tomorrow. I do like. Yes, you’ve got to stay here. What are you doing? Take off your clothes. Take off your clothes! You hear? Take off your clothes. Who took you to the Black Mass? -Tell me. -Just friends, that’s all. Yes, friends, friends. -What friends? -Some of my friends who come to the discotheque. The discotheque. Which? You know it, it’s the one in a cave. Yes, their names, their names. -There’s Raymond. -Raymond. Who else? -Anna. -Anna. Who else? -And Paulie. -Who else? I want all the names. Stop it, you’re hurting me! You’ve got to tell me the names! I want to know all the names! Tell me! Tell me. I’ve got to know. (guitar music) (music stopping) You must kiss this cross. Kiss this cross. Kiss it if you want to save your soul. Repeat after me: I am possessed by the devil. Repeat after me: I am possessed by the devil. You are possessed by the devil! I know you are. -I’m going to exorcise you. -You’re crazy. All right, it’s true, I’m possessed by the devil. Confess that the devil is ruling you in heart, mind, and body. In heart, mind, and body, confess, child, confess to Heaven. -Confess. -I confess that the devil rules me in heart, mind, and body. Swear it! Yes. That’s good. Now repeat: Humbly, I accept the punishment for my greatest offense and my wicked transgressions. -Repeat it. -Please! Go on! Repent. Repent! (gasping) (speaking Latin) Amen. Your excoriation will now begin. (gasping) (moaning) Ah. (whimpering) (singing in Latin) (clanking) (clanking continues) (gasping) I will save you. (singing in Latin) You are possessed by the devil. You are an instrument of hellfire, of damnation, and the wages of sin is death. I am all too familiar with sin. I used to be a priest formerly. I was expelled from the priesthood. Those idiots thought I was too severe. They were wrong! My heart was pure and just, and--and intransigent in dealing with sin. I fought with sin, I fought with vice. That’s why I will exorcise you and tear the devil out of your heart. You’re going to die, but your soul will mount to the joys of paradise. Out, Satan. (gasping) (music starting) (speaking Latin) (squawking) (pattering) (music stopping) Good evening. Good evening, Your Lordship. Your guests are awaiting you. Thank you. (moody music) -Good evening. -Happy to see you. Please step in the salon. Oh, my friends, I’m so glad you could come. -How nice of you to ask us. -This is a pleasure. -Good evening, Count. -Good evening. Good evening. Oh, I was wondering if you would make it. We wouldn’t have missed this for anything. Hello! Oh, you look wonderful. Hello, how are you? Oh, this will be a great evening. -Yes. -Yeah. Come, Satan. (drum music) (heavy breathing) The Black Mass has begun. Come, mighty, all-powerful king of darkness. Pray, accept the sacrifice we humbly offer. Your chosen one is awaiting you. Your faithful offer her to you as a sign of their devotion. (owl hooting) (organ music) Admit the devil into your hearts, your minds, your bodies. Come, Abaddon. Come, oh, father of lies. (speaking Latin) (shouting) (whip cracking, shouting) Spirit of Hell, enter into us. Oh, Satan, fill us with your evil power. You will bring the sweetness to sin. You, our master, help us to tread the path of luxury and vice. Oh, Prince of Hades, come, our beloved lord. We pay you homage. We are your slaves. We worship you more than the moon and more than the fires of the sun. Satan! Accept the sacrifice that we offer you, and may her blood flow free into the ritual vessel. (speaking Latin) Priestess of the devil, I raise up this dagger that is now the instrument of your design. Come to me, Prince of Hell, and give me the strength to accomplish your sacrifice. Accept your chosen one. Accept your bride whose blood shall flow in honor of your might. Satan, we worship you. No. (screaming) (music stopping) My dear friends, I’m delighted to present Marina, our victim, who played her part to perfection. (applause) And this is the dagger. Mm-hm. And, now... ...for the second stage. (moody music) (moaning, laughing) Oh, baby, you really know how to do it. (groaning) Ah! (groaning) (groaning) (indistinct chatter) (laughing) (groaning) (grunting) Hey, Louise, she’s very nice. (groaning) Enjoy yourself. Let the pleasure reign. Come on. Let’s see some action. Mmm. Oh, babe. (groaning) (indistinct chatter) (laughing) Hey. Hey! Ooh. (groaning) (groaning) (groaning) (music stopping) (engine puttering) (humming) So, how did you enjoy yourself? Just a nice party, nothing special. Nothing special? You were making it with just about anything in sight. Aw. Oof. Well, it’s the only way to have fun or it’s a bore. Don’t be angry, darling. You’re the man I’m in love with. Yes, I know that, only I find it hard to understand. Oh well, I guess it’s just our difference in age. Oh, but that’s no reason to be jealous. I don’t like feeling ridiculous. Aww. You sometimes get the funniest ideas. You’re a fine-looking man. Your jealousy is flattering, as a matter of fact. It’s not jealousy. It’s simply that I don’t like those people. That’s the last time we go to one of those parties. Aww. (door opening quietly) (grunting and struggling) (gasping) -David, help! -I’ll save your soul. Who are you? You are an instrument of the Devil. You’re in danger of Hell. I will save you. -I’ll exorcise you. -No! -Let me go! -You must pay for your sins. -You must be crazy! -But you aren’t going to die in a state of grace. I shall purify your soul. Repent, my child! Repent, and you will be saved. (gasping) (breathing shakily) (grunting) (breathing shakily) Out, Satan! There. In nomine Patris! Et Filii! (breathing heavily) (knife clicking) (dreadful music) (indistinct whispering) (dreadful music) -Good morning. -Good morning, inspector. I’m all through here. -What a mess! -You’ve done your work, but my work’s just beginning, -I’m afraid. -Who is that young man with you? He’s my new assistant, only, if you ask me-- Oh. Find anything interesting, doctor? Doesn’t have the appearance of the usual sex crime. So, we are not dealing with a sex maniac. -How ’bout the weapon? -A thin-bladed knife, blade about seven inches long. Disemboweled the woman, stabbed the husband. -A real massacre! -A sadist. It could be, but maybe a vendetta. Or a nut! Well, in my opinion, it was neither one nor the other. Something here strikes me as very interesting. The form of the wounds and the depth of the incisions, everything seems to point to the exorcism ritual of the early Inquisition. So you believe that our assassin is Torquemada? Could be a Torquemada of the present day. According to the theories of Flange and Obermeier, our technological age leads to a return to superstition. Oh, now, please, Malou, cut out the flights of imagination and concentrate on conducting this investigation properly. Well, inspector, one of our men spotted somebody, a suspicious character hangin’ around. My friend, your grand inquisitor is probably nothing but a cheap sneak thief who got in a panic. Is this the guy? Yes, inspector. Your name? They call me Meathead. Take off your cap. -No, I won’t. -I said take it off! You pay the hospital if I get pneumonia. Okay, so what’s your name? Meathead. I want your real name. (indistinct foreign name) But for convenience, they call me Meathead. -So what’s your story? -Nothing. You were hanging around that hotel there, what for? Who, me? -I was fermenting. -What? Don’t you talk English? I was sleeping off a hangover! Look, we didn’t get you in here because of that, but because you were carrying a knife. Oh! A tiny little knife for peeling bananas. Look, we know you’ve got a record. They seem to like pulling me in, but I never harm nobody in my life. I’m an angel with a deadly face, that’s all. Just the finger of fate. (sighing) Well, Meathead, fate’s really got you this time. All right, then, angel, you’re gonna be our guest once more. You’re going to try and explain just how you didn’t murder the Cartiers, you get me? -Take him away. -Let’s go. It’s monotonous. Pardon me, inspector, but do you really believe that that man’s the criminal? Now, listen, you college theorists would think I’m making a mistake in holding Mr. Meathead, but I’ve got to hold somebody, innocent or guilty, so that I’ll be left in peace to find the real criminal. (easygoing music) (moaning) (groaning) (gasping) Oh. (deranged music) Anybody home? Doesn’t look like it. (deranged music) You there, Rose? We’re in the bathtub. Let’s get comfortable. (giggling) (deranged music) (laughing) Hi, fellas. Hi there, Rose. -Hello. -Hi! Don’t mind us. -Make yourselves at home. -Oh! (deranged music) (giggling) What brings you here? We came to get Raymond. He’s not here. He’s with the police. It’s not important, anyway, I’m busy now. (deranged music) (moaning) (deranged music) (moaning and giggling) No. (deranged music) Why don’t you take off your robe? (indistinct speaking) Your name? Raymond Franval. Occupation? I am the Director of Venus Publications and of the Dagger and Garter Weekly. Ah, a purveyor of culture. Are you one of my readers, perhaps? No. I hardly have the time to even read the sport page in the Figaro. Ah, yes, well, I see what you mean. My magazine wouldn’t exactly be up your street. Mr. Franval, I called you in here in the hope you could give me some details or some sidelights on the Cartiers. The Cartiers, I see them around occasionally. They’re nice people, plenty of money. You’ll never see them again. They’ve been murdered. (gasping) Your magazine’s grapevine doesn’t seem to be working as it should. That’s enough, Malou. We found one of your visiting cards in the pocket of Mr. Cartier. As a journalist, do you have any idea about a possible culprit? Enemies? Acquaintances? Or something interesting from your angle of Dagger and Garter? Nothing at all. They were merely nice folks. Incidentally, they were rich, only they didn’t have money to burn, -far from it. -Yes, yes, I understand. Mr. Franval, I take it you have no objections, then, -to, uh, identifying the bodies? -Huh! Well, I find it unpleasant, but if you insist, I will. Call Durand. Durand. Take this gentleman along to the morgue. -Follow me, please. -Right. May I ask exactly how the Cartier’s were killed? They were murdered with a dagger, just like in the stories you publish. That’s interesting, maybe I can use it. We like authenticity, good-bye. I’m ready. Well, Malou, what do you think of him for our culprit? No comment. (muffled screaming) Mm, Maria Teresa. Hm. My darling, why are you angry with me? (Maria sighing) -Why? Why? -Do you really want to know? I love you! Maria. Because you’re a vicious old sadist, -a homosexual. -Yes, it’s true. -A degenerate. -Oh, yes! -A dirty pig! -It’s true. -A shit eater, a swine! -Yes, oh, yes. -I disgust you. -No! Let me go. Come here. On your knees. (moaning) Undress me. Oh, mm. (moaning) Take off your clothes. (groaning) (moaning) Maria. Get undressed. (moaning and breathing heavily) Oh, look at that. Oh, yeah. (breathing heavily) You’re a filthy old lecher. You are as disgusting as a leper’s sores. (moaning) I hate you! I abhor you! Oh, Maria. You make me vomit! Ah! (moaning) All right, stand up. -Get on the bed... -Maria. ...you old imp. Oh, Maria. -Oh, darling. -You filth! (breathing heavily) (moaning) (rooster crowing) (suspicious music) (moaning) Yes, oh, Maria! Oh, Maria, that’s-- Yes, yes, Maria. (moaning and grunting) -You dirty lecher! -Maria! -You old pervert! -Yes, more, oh. Travesty! Rapist! (indistinct speaking) (moaning and grunting) (somber music) (gasping) Don’t be scared. Don’t be afraid, countess. I’ve come to save your soul. You are a sinner! I’m going to help you expiate your sins. Stand up! Who are you? What do you want? Put your head down. Put it down! (screaming) (grunting) Ego te absolvo de peccatis tuis in nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti. Amen. (door closing) (upbeat music) So, you have a hunch the police suspect you? -That’s about it. -Ha. They must be out of their minds! Even a cop could tell you’re not a murderer. You can say that again. Anyway, I suspect the murderer is probably one of our crowd. You could be right, and I don’t wanna be the next victim. -That’s all we needed, huh. -Our murderer doesn’t only -kill women. -Say he wants equal numbers of men and women. I heard that sex maniacs like that often have method in their madness. No, I think you’re wrong. He’s a woman hater. So they think I did those killings to provide authentic material for my magazine. After all, if I really had committed those murders, it wouldn’t be for that sort of reason. Well, I mean, I’d rather rape Raquel Welch or pull a hold-up, for example. No, no, I can’t believe that the police really think that I did it, only they’re absolutely convinced that I played a part in it somewhere or other. They think I lead a bad life. -They’re not far off. -Maybe! (laughing) Anyhow, what do you expect? A cop could never understand -our way of life. -I guess not, Rose. Yet, I think they’re getting near the truth. The motive behind these murders has got something to do with our quest for excitement in the domain of black magic. (laidback music) Excuse me, I thought Raymond was here. Well, come in anyway. Thank you. I came to bring him my new manuscript. It’s supposed to go in next week’s number. I’d be very glad if you would read it. -Fine, I’d like to. -It’s a true story. Yes, I’ll read it! I shall be honored to have your opinion as to its merits. It’s a story of unhappiness. You promise you’ll read it? I already said so. Thank you. What for? The darkness of Mary Anna’s room was pierced by only a faint light. On the other side of the street, somebody moved a curtain. The man’s tormented, haggard face looked out. His eyes expressed his hopeless longing for her, but his heart denied him the courage to speak. But his vigil was not in vain. Mary Anna came into her room. She was not alone this time. Her partner in fleshly lusts was with her. The two girls clasped each other, and began to undress. Their gleaming bodies were exposed. Hands clasped, mouths met in forbidden kisses. The man decided to free Mary Anna of the demon that possessed her... (thumping) ...to save her soul at any cost. He had the power to save her. (knocking) He opened the door of his apartment and directed his feet toward her dwelling. Ah! Mr. Vogel! -Good evening. -But why are, -why are you here? -I have to speak to you. Oh, all right. (screaming) (lively music) (whimpering) Anna. -Mm-hm. -Anna! (shakily breathing) (grunting) (moaning) -Anna. Anna. -No. No! Let me go! -Anna! -Let me go! Oh! Don’t be afraid. I don’t want to kill you. I don’t want to kill you! (Vogel sobbing) You’re possessed by the Devil. Possessed by the Devil. -No! No! -You are possessed by the Devil. You’re possessed by the Devil! -No! -I will exorcise you. I will free you. You must repent! Anna, I’ll save you. Anna, I’ll save you. (screaming and grunting) Anna! Anna! (screaming) I love you. I love you. You’re possessed by the Devil, but I love you. I love you, Anna. Love you. No, stay down! (crying) Ego te absolvo de peccatis tuis... ...in nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti. Amen. (energetic music) That’s funny. What is? Anna’s not back yet. Maybe she’s out with Fred. (doorbell ringing) -There she is. -Open it. (energetic music) Hello! -Hello, Rose! -Marina, Fred. -Hi, there! -What’s this in aid of? We’ve come to pick up Anna. But Anna’s not here. We thought she was out with you! That’s very strange. We had a date to go to the movies together. -Yes, that’s strange. -That’s just what I said to Ray. Well, I suppose she wants to be alone. That doesn’t sound like her. No, it doesn’t really. I hope nothing’s happened to her. (energetic music) (muffled music) (moaning) (breathing heavily) (muffled music) (breathing heavily) (muffled music) (phone ringing) Oh, for God’s sake! Hello? Anna! Where are you? Where are you, honey? You what? You’re with a friend, well, what friend? Answer me! She hung up. So, what? Well, she always has had rather peculiar ways. Only recently, she’s gotten worse. (typewriter clacking) Inspector, the technical services Interpol sent our data into the computer, and it came up with a few names. Among them, I selected Vogel, Paul, a Czechoslovak. His real name is Paul Rosik. He’s an unfrocked priest escaped from an asylum. He’s a writer, and the German police want him for offenses against minors. He could be our man. My dear Malou, you are the limit. Perhaps this poor Vogel is crazy, but that doesn’t prove that he’s the man we’re after. Even though he happens to live in the apartment right across the street from those girls who are friends of Franval, -the magazine publisher? -So Vogel lives opposite, so what? Well, if that’s not enough, go ahead and call me an idiot, but I’d like a little talk with Franval and his friends. -They’re all yours. -You’re in for a shock. -I’d better see what he’s up to. -Okay, I’ll hold the fort. Malou? (typewriter clacking) (yawning) Mm. Mm. Oh. Mm. Hmph! Hm. Raymond! -Raymond, wake up. -What do you want? Anna isn’t back yet. I’m beginning to get worried. Well, she did phone after all. She’s old enough to know what she’s doing. I know. I know. Maybe I’m being stupid, but it’s just not like her. This is the first time she’s stayed away for an entire night! Well, what of it? I’m scared, that’s all. I’ve got a nasty feeling something’s happened to her. You think so? (doorbell ringing) Police. -Good morning. -The police? -Good morning, inspector. -Sorry for disturbing you. What can we do for you gentlemen? This is Inspector Tanner and his assistant. Ah. Did you know that a certain Paul Vogel has rented an apartment just opposite yours? No, why should we? Did you also know that for the last two days, nobody seems to have seen him around anywhere? He has done a vanishing act. That’s a coincidence. Uh, Anna, a friend who lives here with me, has vanished as well. If I can give you a word of advice, I’d cut out all of this nonsense of yours with black masses. Already four of your group have died. You might even be the next. Mm. Nomine Patris, et Filii, et Spiritus Sancti. Amen. Oremus. (singing prayer in Latin) (Anna groaning) My darling, Anna, I absolve you of your sins. I absolve you! (tense music) Anna! (screaming) (tense music) (grunting and slapping) (spitting) (tense music) (screaming) (tense music) (inaudible) (tense music) Rose, come here! What is it? This is one of Paul Vogel’s manuscripts. -Where did you find it? -Right here. He talks about torture, flagellation, crucifying a girl, exorcising the Devil, read it! He talks of disemboweling, washing away sins with blood, and purification with a knife. -Well, what is it? -I want to talk to you. What about? That last story of yours. Did it impress you? Yes, very much. Extremely sadomasochistic. But nevertheless, it had the ring of authentic experience. What are you implying? That you know a lot too much about these murders for a man who is innocent! You mean that I-- You don’t understand. She’s very upset about the disappearance of Anna. You mean Anna’s disappeared? You know she’s disappeared! If you suspect me, then go to the police. My conscience is clear. What about yours? Are your consciences as clear as they should be? Our black masses, perhaps. Black masses? What do you mean? That’s right, if you’re interested, we’re holding one later tonight in the cloister of the Templars. It would give us great pleasure if you attend, Mr. Vogel. I’ll come. Yes. I’ll come! (clattering) (rattling) Ah! (groaning) (grunting) (eerie music) (easygoing jazz music) (whipping) (easygoing jazz music) (music stops) Ah. Inspector! Inspector! You took a terrible chance, you might have been murdered. You college boys never make mistakes like ordinary cops. Oh, but this mistake really hurts. I’ve been looking for you because they’re holding another black mass. (easygoing jazz music) (manic distorted music) There goes the murderer. -He just killed Rose! -Get in. (urgent music) (car speeding away) (urgent music) (sirens wailing) (car speeding) (siren wailing) (urgent music) We’ve got to hurry. Come, Anna! (urgent music) (screaming) (car approaching) -Hold it, Vogel! -Anna! Anna! No! Let me go! Or I’ll kill her. I delivered them from evil. I freed them from the power of the Devil. I don’t want to hurt this girl! I love her! I’ll save her soul by my prayers. I’ll purify her of her sins! Don’t you understand? I am the sword of the Lord. I am the sword of the Lord! You must let me go. Let us go! -Give yourself up. -Go away, or I’ll kill her. Don’t make me. You mustn’t! (gun firing) (screaming) Anna! You’ve got to admit, inspector, that we police college graduates get the right idea sometimes. Mm-hm, well, uh, these egg-head cops, I’m not convinced. Maybe you are an exception. Good work, Malou. (car starting) (upbeat music)
