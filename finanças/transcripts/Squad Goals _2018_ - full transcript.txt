--== McEphie ==-- Oh, my God! I'm so scared. Prof, what's taking so long? You haven't done anything! We've been waiting for hours. Where are our children? What has happened to them? -Let's call the police. -Everyone please calm down. I'm sure your children are safe. Safe? Do you realize it's 3:00 in the morning? Where are our children? Hello! Mom! Hello? What? Chief! I think there's no signal here. There it is! Mom, hello! We're here at-- Damn it, Chief. You're out of credits. What? Give me that. Jeez! My phone credits are gone. Sir, can I maybe call my dad? I just said I'm out of phone credits. Damn this precinct for not reimbursing our calls. Well, you'll just keep calling your girlfriends! Sir, is it our fault? Sir, it's 4:20 a.m. Can you let us out now? You asked for it. Why can't you be like your friend there? He's quiet. This is pointless. Tom said they were doing a project for your subject. Is that true? I didn't even know Channing is working on a project. Sir, where's my son? Our sons won't graduate on time because of your project! Mr. Destino, your sons won't be graduating. You'll have to wait until summer. What? What's up, guys? This is your boy, Young D. This is Sexy Music Dance Floor. I have a new dance cover I hope you'll like it. Like, comment, share. Right now! Music, please. This is my son, Benj. He's going to be an engineer like me. Hi, Benj. Pleased to meet you. Excuse me, son. I'll just show Mr. Corpuz the model. What? Excuse me. So... My head's cut off here. I apologize, sir. It is his fault. I'm really sorry, sir. This is for my monument, right? I'm truly sorry. I'm very disappointed. I gave you another chance and look what you're doing. I mean... I guess the deal is off. Hold on, sir. It really was my fault. Would you please give my dad a second chance? I'm very sorry. You better thank your son, Engineer Destino. Anyway, I'm giving you another chance. But you better make it good. Thank you, Mr. Tiny. Benjamin, I'm not done with you. Shouldn't you be in class today? Yes, Dad. And since when did you learn to read backwards? Hans! Hans! Mom. There is food. Now you better get ready for school. Do I really have to go? Yeah. I don't want to go back to Germany just yet. So you have to finish up school this year. You'll have to stay here a little longer. -Okay. -Okay. And... Please use a deodorant. You know how hot it gets here in the Philippines. Not like in Germany. You don't have to take a shower during winter time. Okay? I don't smell, though. -Of course you do. I've got to go. -Yeah, okay. And please, next time you watch porn, close the door. I wasn't watching porn, it's for musical reference. Hi, babe! Babe! You're so gross. What's that? Is that what you're wearing to school? Babe, ball is life. -Aren't you coming to class? -Are you? Don't you get it? You know, we're always in the public's eye all the time. We have to look good for the paparazzi. There's surely a lot of them. Let's just eat. Is this it? You know what, you complain too much! Just enjoy the food. Do I look like a goat to you? Come on. I'm starving! Wait! Wait. I'll take a picture of it first. Hey, Am-boy. You're going? Yeah, man. I'm running late for school. And I'm Australian. Isn't Australia in America anyway? Hey, kid! This is the last stop. Pay up. Hurry up! I know all your tricks. Hey! Get back here! You're good looking. Finally! Thanks! I'll wash my youngest's bottoms with this. I'm running late. -This is for washing up. -I need to go! Go do it there! Let go! Thank you! Thank you! You're really nice. But, Grandpa, this is mine. I'll take a bath now, son. -Thank you. -Sure thing, Grandpa. Fill it up again. Great, there's water. I'll go first. Okay, Grandma. Go ahead. Thank you! No problem! I guess everyone's finished, yes? Perhaps you'll let me have my turn because I'm late. Jeez. I'm off to school without a shower again. There are many branches of Sociology. History, Anthropology, and Behavioral Economics. But in this class, we will discuss the Basics of Sociology in-- Like I was saying, in this class we'll be discussing Social Science 1. My name is Professor Mandy Daluyong. This Prof must be crazy. But you can all call me Sir Mandy if you'd like. Now that I have your attention, please introduce yourselves. Get to know each other. I'm Benjamin Destino. I'm an Engineering student. I love reading novels. I'm also good at playing board games. I know how to dance. My name is Thomas Florida, Jr., aka Tom. Fourth year HRM student, varsity team captain and three-time MVP. Nathaniel Dimatulac. You can call me Nat for short, but not for long. Fourth year HRM student. Jersey number 23 in varsity, but number one in your hearts. And, I'm also in the Dean's List, so, girls, are you into smart guys? Never mind my looks, I'm totally yummy. Johan Sebastian Kaiser. Conservatory. Chad Paddington. "Pads" for short. Mass Communication senior. Born and raised in Australia, and a working student. Okay. Now that I know you all, let's start the class. Sociology 1 is the study of human behavior. But I will not be teaching you this. Rather, the best teacher in life... Which is? Sir, do you mean God? Is that right? Mister? What's your name again? Nat! Of That's My Tomboy Tondo! You're funny. Why? Mr. Nat? As in "Natalie"? Does anyone have something else to say? You know, I've handled worse than this class before. So I won't be intimidated by your antics. Prior to this, I was teaching gang members, gangsters, delinquents at the Boys' Town Academy. So, Mr. Dimatulac, you should try harder. You got served. Back to what I was saying! In this class... I will not teach you. Experience will become your teacher. There are three aspects that I want you all to learn in my class. It will help you in your growth as responsible individuals. Sir, what is your grading system? Nerd. You know, I'm glad that you asked, Mr. Destino. This is not a traditional class. You won't have prelims, midterms, and finals. I'm not finished. Just because you won't have written exams doesn't mean you shouldn't take this class seriously. You know. So, instead, I will give you a special project. Wait. You'll choose between three themes. Society, Family, and Love. You need to submit a documented study of a social experiment of one of the three themes that I mentioned. You get to decide how to go about it in your pace. Which means you can submit early and not have to come to class anymore. Class is over! Class is over! Class is over! Okay. Remember... This is your only shot. If you submit a mediocre project... Now, we'll split up into groups. Each group has five members. Sir, should we count off? Nerd! All right. The four of you who were late, you're group number one. Mr. Destino, since you're so active, join them. -Hey! The prof is talking to you. -Sir! Here's my payment. Benjamin, what is this? I thought you were studying. Dad, classes just started. There you go again with your dancing! As long as you're under my roof, you'll do as I say and be an engineer. Don't you want this? Don't you want to take over Destino Builders? You're wasting time on this. Dad, I'm sorry. Quit your dancing. It won't do you any good. Mom, wait! Don't throw this away, please. This is the biggest EDM festival in the country and I'm planning to be a part of it. Son, please clean your room. Do you have a pet rat or snake in here? Mom, we live in the city. I'm just kidding. The point is, clean the room. -Yeah, okay. -Besides, why do you bother with that local fest? You're just wasting your time. Once we go back, you can set a bigger scene in Europe. Yeah, I know. It's just practice, anyway. Just practice. Anyway, how's school? Actually, it was all right. There were a couple of rascals in my class, but they were funny. Try not to get too attached. You won't be with them for long. Yeah. -I know. -Okay? Tom. Yes, Pa. Killer instinct, clutch, "head in the game." I got that covered. I'm a three-time MVP, remember? Fine, you got it. But focus on your studies first. You might be playing even during tests. You won't be a star player forever. You've got to have a Plan B. It can't be, "Ball is life," always. I'm just concerned about your future, son. I don't want you to end up like-- He won't end up like you. He's my son, too. Besides, if he can't play basketball anymore, he can be an actor or a model like his mom. Not like someone we know. Let's meet for the Project. Where did you get my number? You gave it to me bro. Why? Tyler, there are no toys here. Wow. That's two Tagalog words. You're improving. Are you smoking in here again? Your sister, Salve, is pregnant. You really don't care about your family, do you? Tomorrow, you need to contribute to this house. Wake up, sleepyhead, and get to work. I'll be waiting for your share tomorrow. Let's go, Tyler. Coach! Nat's not here yet. Can we wait for him? Don't get this rookie in yet. Why don't you be the coach, then? It's his problem he's not here. Young D? Cool name. Girls. He's totally savage. Rumor has it, he's studying here now. Really? We better get acquainted so we can see whether he's really good. Sir, Tom and I just got back from the game. If you think you'll pass this subject by just coasting around, you guys are wrong. Next time, make sure you come in before me. Or else, you'll be marked as absent. So, are we done? We're here now. Let's just meet. We're not all here. Sleepyhead is missing. I know where Pads works. Are you close? Is he your new best friend? Jealous? I went with Kate the other day for her food blog. I did her layout and I saw Pads there. That's probably where he is since he doesn't have friends. Should we go to him? Okay. Let's go fetch Pads. All right, let's go with Queen Mother. -Come on! -Let's get going. I got stuck, wait up. Let's go! How much longer are we waiting for him? -Okay, I'll go get him. -Wait! Can't you see he's busy with a girl? I thought his shift is over. Maybe he's doing overtime. Should we just cancel? Hey, nerd. Is your dad looking for you already? Do you want us to call him? One more. You know what, instead of quarreling, let's just grab some drinks while waiting for Pads. Game? Just two rounds. I still have a class. We still have classes, too. Don't worry, I'll take care of you. We're all friends here. We won't let you get drunk. Waiter? Can you get us one bucket? And one iced tea for my friend here. The one with the cute umbrella. Is Pads going to take long? Let's play beer pong. -Game? -I'll have to pass. You're a party-pooper, Destino. Come on! Come on! Okay. You guys against us. -All right! -Game! -Who's going to start? -You wish! Ladies first! Go ahead, take your shot! Here's to our future! It's hard. Bro. Can we stop for a bit? I feel like throwing up. Weak. Hey, German boy! You want me to throw up on you? Hey, Nat. Will you please? Don't throw up in here. This is my dad's car. All right, guys, we're near. Wait, I feel like going to the bathroom. What? Altogether? Hold it! You were taking so long. It's your fault Nat's drunk. What happened? He's needs to throw up. So, do you guys have anything to say for yourselves? Drinking during class hours? Until now, I still smell like sizzling pork. That was congee, sir-- I mean "ma'am." I'm sorry. That's beside the point. I don't care if it was steak! You guys are in deep trouble. Dean Lustre, we're really sorry. We're taking responsibility. Please forgive us. You had to play the leader. You're confusing! I'm trying to get us out of trouble. Why are you mad at me? -Why are we mad? -What? You know what? Why don't you guys just go get a room? What did you say? Hey, cut him some slack. He helped us out when we got drunk. And you! You had to confess we were drunk. He's funny, isn't he? Go on, laugh. You'll never set foot on this campus again. You guys are suspended indefinitely. -You shouldn't have thrown up on her. -It's your fault! I had too much congee. You asked for beer pong, but you can't handle it. I said sorry. Hi, Dean, you called for me? Is this a bad time? I can always come back. Thank God you're here, Mr. Daluyong. You guys are suspended and that's final. Dean? Why are they suspended? They were caught drinking during class hours. And they even threw up on me. But Dean, we wouldn't have left the campus if Mr. Daluyong hadn't told us to go. You have the nerve to pin the blame on Mandy! Can I call you "Mandy"? Is this true, Mandy? Yes, they were late. You see, so it's still your fault. Do you have anything else to say, Mr. Dimatulac? No, ma'am. Shut your mouth. Dean, I have a suggestion if that's okay. Okay, I'm listening. Dean, I'm not denying my past as a gang member. In fact, I was sent to Boys' Town Academy. But, Dean, these boys won't learn anything if we just suspend them. When I was at the Boys' Town Academy, our punishment was extra work until we learned our lesson. You know, Mandy, I see the value in that. I have a plan. Babe! I've been looking all over for you. We're supposed to be the couple of the night. Why are you wearing that? Babe, Dean made us wear this as punishment. I can explain. Babe. Oh, hey, the captain's looking dapper. Like a hold-dapper. Jerk. -I'm so sorry. -It's okay! Though I think your shoes are also full. Let's go. GO FOR IT! SNOB - GO FOR IT! I think I need to do this. Bro, she's my girlfriend. Chill, bro, it's just a photo. Excuse me. Yes, you are my boyfriend, but you don't look the part. Babe. Come on! You were supposed to be my date but I couldn't reach you. Can't I be busy at work? Look at my suit. I look nice, right? Why should I look at your suit? You look like a fool. Do I look like a fool? Look at me. Young D. So the rumors are true. Guess it's time to leave. Benj just owned it. Did you see that? Young D, he was dancing on the dance floor. Stupid. That was just Destino. Don't call me stupid. He was right there. Are you blind? Whatever. What? You guys saw him, right? He was awesome! Look at this. Look at the finishing. You need to master this. Isn't it? This one, too. Per block, per inch. -Yes. -Isn't it? This is not an easy job. You need to be hands on. You always have to stick with me. Besides... -Benjamin! -Dad? Are you listening? You need to do better with your studies. We never know, maybe tomorrow we don't have projects anymore. You must graduate soon. Yes, dad. Sorry. -Do you understand? -Yes. Make sure I can rely on you. -Okay? -Yes, dad. My gosh! How much longer until we finish? Lord, take me now. Son, I want to buy you a hoodie. Do you prefer plain or stripes? Plain. I'm not quite sure about the quality here. It's not like in Germany which has high standards. Yeah, I know, Mom. Remember I kinda grew up there, right? Right. Son, I signed up on Facebook. Accept my friend request, would you? Nope. Bad idea. Why so? I can't quite follow what your cousins are saying, so at least you can explain it to me. For example, "IMHO." What does that mean? "In my humble opinion." I see. All I know are "LOL" and "BRB." What about "AFK"? What is that? Is that lewd? "Away from keyboard." Last one, what about... "IDGAF"? "I don't give a f--" Mom? Can we go home now? Please, I'm tired. You came with me, but you're grumpy with me. I should have just gone to CrossFit. Well, you sort of forced me to come with you. Deal with it. Fine. Let's go. Dinner with babe and the family! We're back together! -Smile for me! -Okay. You don't seem happy. I am smiling. Get used to it. We'll be just like this in the future. Okay. I'll just go find my aunt. Babe, can you stay here? Why? Let's go to my room. Let's do Redflix and chill. You... All right. I'll be right back. -Okay. -So people won't notice. Dad! What are you doing there? Your Aunt Dolly didn't bring enough food. -Are you full? -No. Have some. Your cooking is better. Son, can you check the score on Switter? Sure, Dad. Dad, your Ginebra lost to my San Miguel. I knew they shouldn't have let that Caguioa play. Where's Nat? Weren't you with him? Whatever, man. I gotta go to work soon. -Waste of time. -Let's go! Take a seat. Kate's here to help us with that social experiment project. Her blog gets a lot of traffic. Her bag's full of stuff, too. Laptop, phone, toothbrush, complete with toothpaste. She's got a shop, too. You're really funny. There you go again, with your underhanded schemes. Give me one. Okay, wait. What are we going to do? I have no idea. Too bad. Hey, Destino! Who are you trying to fool with your mask, being Young D and all? So, you're Young D. He's Young D. What does the "D" stand for? Douche? Daddy's Girl? Maybe D... So you are Young D! Look, you've got so many haters. One nasty comment and everyone follows suit. Come on. Are you really Young D? Tell me. He is! Okay! Anyway, I have an idea. What? Why don't we throw a party in the library? Library? You'll get us into trouble. You're going to mess up my Dean's List streak. Right. Never mind that. Think of something else. Great, you're losing your spine again. Okay, guys. Let's not do that. Let's go with whatever's comfortable for everyone. Just because you're a party boy foreigner. What's your problem with me? If I had my way, I would have left all of you. What's taking you so long? Don't you dare act so brave when you're so sensitive. All you do is talk. You don't scare me with your Young D gimmick. Dancing's all you know. -Just dancing? -That's right. -Okay, let's go. -Sure. My God, can't you guys stop bickering like a couple? Look, I want to pass this subject, too. But at least I'm not being a little bitch about it. You really have to fight in front of my baby girl? "Baby girl"? That's what I like about you. You're positive in every single situation. I will pass this test, guys. 'Cause if we don't, I'll be a slave to Connor forever. Wait up. All right, plug that. Okay, ready? Are you done with the homework? See you. Are you barbarians? Can you be quiet in the library? Don't you know who I am? In case you still don't know who I am, I am the librarian. Conan The Librarian. I'm the eagle that watches this nest of learning. I'll be watching you. Yes! Why are you dancing? Quiet! Hey! Get down from there! Stop! I'm telling you, stop that! Quiet! Hey! What are you doing? It's not my birthday yet. Put me down! The theme of our social experiment is about Herd Mentality. Which states that, if one or two people start doing something, chances are many others will do the same. Right. Very well said, Mr. Destino. But before you show the class... I'd like to introduce and invite our special panel for group discussions. We are so dead. This is not good. Guys. You're right about herd mentality. But because of your execution, where you performed this experiment, which led to the destruction of school property, I have no choice but to fail you. Sir, we're sorry. You know, you guys have it easy. You almost got suspended, again. But because I spoke to the Dean, all you have to do is help with fixing the library. Okay? Excuse me. Let's do this again tomorrow, okay? My way's here, so I'll see you guys. You know what? Nobody believes in your mask gimmick anymore. Are you mad at me? Did I do something wrong to you, Leigh? How did you know my name? Are you a stalker? No. Aren't you the cheer captain? That's you, isn't it? I'm not a stalker. But you are. Why were you watching me? Excuse me, I wasn't watching you. I just happened to pass by. This is my usual route home. Besides, you were so noisy. It's late. So, why do you care about me? Come on, I'll walk you home. Wow. I'm impressed. Good going. What are you so cross about? I'll walk you home. -Let's go out together. -I don't want you to. I challenge you to battle! What do you say? I have a better idea. Wait. LML? LML. Leigh My Love. Cheesy. That's what I was saying. Let's team up for this talent show. I was impressed by your dancing, that's why... We'll win for sure. You're such a flirt. Fine. On one condition. I'll choose the song. But before all that, I have to get your number. You might change your mind. You've got a lot of nerve. 39554321212. If you don't call me, I won't answer you. You need to pass. Good. Okay, just keep going. -Tom. -Coach? Let's talk. What's the matter, coach? How do I put this... I heard about your academic evaluation. So I have to suspend you for the rest of the season. I'm suspended for the rest of the season? Yes. You're a waste of talent, kid. But you realize you're not allowed to fail, right? So, I'm sorry. Take a break for a while. Relay the news to Dimatulac, okay? Yes, coach. Keep it up next time. Babe. I'm sorry, Tom. What are you doing? I heard everything, Tom. About SocSci 1 and you being kicked out of the varsity team. You have to understand it was just an accident, Sofia. Fix your life, Tom. What are you doing? That's what you get for hanging out with-- Don't drag Nat into this. This is my own problem. No. Since you started hanging out with your crew, you stopped having time for me. Are we still on the same page? Maybe-- You know what, Sofia? Your problem is you always care about what other people think. What about what I like? Do you ever think about that? You're so difficult. I don't get you anymore. You're making a scene, Tom. Please don't humiliate me. I'm leaving. And don't try to follow me. So, you don't want this anymore? If you don't, neither do I. Fine! We are over. Guess what, guys. I got promoted! -Wow, Daddy! You're amazing. -No way. No way, man. Are you serious? Yup. That's not all. I also got a salary increase and a car plan. Nice, man! Pack your bags for tomorrow, we're going to Baguio! You like it there, right? It snows there. Okay. Let's eat. Pads. Stay behind and look after the house. We'll just be gone for the weekend. Right, Pads. Anyway, let's eat. Here, Pads. Have some. You need to eat -because we're going to Baguio. -No, it's okay. I'm not hungry. He says he's not hungry. Excuse me. Did you pay for that? Hey, good boy. If you don't want any, it's okay. And of course, Tom paid for that. Me? Wait. I thought we're talking about our class cards. I'll take care of that, Benj. I can do your diploma, too. If you like. Diploma? If our company goes bankrupt, will you edit that, too? Destino, don't be a baby. Everyone's having a hard time. Real talk. How are you going to pay for your tuition? I had some money saved from odd jobs last summer. As for the extension... I'm with sleepyhead here. Whatever goes! It's worse to be scared of-- Wow! This place is crawling with girls! Let me check Tinder. I might get lucky. Speaking of a match. Easy swipe to the left. "Easy swipe to the left." You're funny, aren't you? Do you have a hit? Not one. Excuse me, guys. I got a match. Sorry, man. -Let me in on that. -Jeez. Classic Pads. Let's drink. Cheers! I'm single! I'm single now! I'm single now, bros! I am single. -You're making me cry, Tom. -Hey, it's fine! Hi. I'm Autumn. What? Awkward. My friends just egged me on to introduce myself to you. -So sorry. -Oh, no. It's cool. Hans! Hi. I saw you earlier while I was playing my set, but you kind of looked weirded out by the place. Wow. You're kind of direct but yes. My style's more laid-back. You know, old soul. Hipster. I get it, you're a hipster. That was pretty offensive. I've got to get back to my friends. It was nice to meet you. Oh, wait. Can I get your number? -My number? -Yeah, your number. Sorry. It was just a dare. Okay. If you want, I have a gig coming up. Just check IG for where and when. You play? A little. Here's my IG. Just check that. Okay. Awesome. I have to go. Okay. What's up, lover boy? You're lucky you met someone! My wingman's gotten drunk. Look at you. How can I possibly be your wingman, when you won't approach any of the girls? Come on, let's just dance. Just a dance. Which part of "I don't want to dance with you" can't you understand? Hey, man! She doesn't want to dance with you. Come on, what's your problem? I just asked your friend to dance. Don't you know me? I don't care who you are. They don't want to. Why are you forcing it? Come on. Come on, man. She said no. Leave her alone. Mind your own business, bro. It's okay, Hans. We're fine. We're leaving. -Move! -Don't touch me! Dude, Hans seems to be tangled up with something. Let's go. Hey, wake up. Hey! Hey! What do you want, bro? -Wrong choice. -What are you talking about? You'll be first blood, boy. What do you say? Hey! Is that your best shot? You're a show off. One punch, man. We're not even done yet! Sir, these guys started it. They didn't do anything. They were just trying to help because these guys were being rude to us. You're nothing. Weakling. Especially you. Don't you dare go out. Why, man? -Kiss my-- -Nat, just shut up. Hans, you didn't have to do that. But thank you. Those guys were being total d-bags. It was nothing. I'm just happy you're okay. I have to go. Shut up. Where's the fight? I'm here. I'm ready. Where are they? Are you okay? That punch landed square on your face. Here, I will give you a chance to punch me. It's nothing, man. You know, he's just a loser. He should have picked a guy his own size. I'll fight him. Aren't you tired of getting beaten up? Do you want me to beat you up again? These guys never learn. Overkill! There's so many of them! Run! Hurry! Hurry, hurry! Let's go here. Let's go! Wait, wait! I'll drive! Ouch! Hurry! Guys. Ice cream? -There we go. -There, that's delicious. Give me some of that. -Here. -That's mine. -This is mine. -Here, grab one. Thank you. Do you have a straw? This is almost soupy. Thanks, bro. No, man, I should be thanking you. Especially Benj and Pads. You guys hit hard. Real hard. You don't run out of things to say. You know, we're a crew. Whatever happens, we've got each other's backs. Right, Benj? Guys, wait. Hold on. Hello? Yeah. Oh, really? Thanks! Send me the details. I'll see you there. Who was that? Was that Autumn? No. It was the Bikini Bottom Festival people. They saw me in the club earlier tonight and... Guess what? They want me to play a set at the biggest EDM fest in the country. Solid. Congratulations, bro. Bring on the drinks. Congrats, bro. Congrats, man. Dirty! Delicious! I agree to be your partner. Why? You're getting all giddy. By the way, son, how are your studies? I'm doing good, Pa. How about your work? It's okay. I'm back to driving Uber. Praise the Lord! That's why our finances are pretty smooth. The important thing is honest work. Son, how are your grades? Are you still part of the Dean's List? That's the thing. Here, Dad. Wow. How impressive! Say again? It's so clean, forming a straight line like this. Straight A's all the way. Son, you shouldn't stress yourself out too much. You can get enough rest and still get A minus or B plus. We'd be okay with it. But keep it up, son. Go ahead, have some food. All right, but I have somewhere to be. I'll just take a quick shower before the water runs out. Just use perfume. Save water. You're here. I thought you were gonna flake on me. What? Me? No. I'm a man of my word. And I really like you. I mean music. I like your music. Yeah. Me too. You really like me too? Wait. Chill for a bit. You're sweating like crazy even though it's cold in here. Kim? -What are you doing here? -Channing? Oh, my God. -It's been ages. How are you? -I'm good, I'm good. Why are you here again? My cousins are by the music area, so I was just looking around. My friends are over there. Let me introduce you to them. -Yeah, okay. -Sweet. Let's go. -Can I have one? -Yeah, go ahead. Wait. You get girls and I don't? Dude, I'm all for that plan but... No one's bringing a girl. We'll find girls there. Hey, American boy's bringing someone over. What's up, guys. This is Kimberly... my friend. Channing, I'm your girl. Remember? Yeah, that's what I meant. Hi, Kim! Nice to meet you. I'm Nat. This is Benj. This is Tom. And this is Hans. And we are... The Not-So-Good-Looking! What? So what now? Are you in, Pads? Where? Tom's birthday. Yeah, dude. We're going out. Game? I'm game. Can I come? Sorry, girl. But it's BNO. What? Boys Night Out. -Sorry, Kim. Maybe next time. -Okay. One wave. Like this, okay? One, two, three. Go! Cheers. Don't! Give me some money! Hurry up! Give it to me. What's going on? Miss? Miss? Miss, you're still gonna dance. Miss, we still have one thousand pesos. Hey, Miss? Where did she go? That's what I'm talking about! Yes! Hey. -What's up, bro? -Why not? They're offering Social Science again this semester. It's true. Mr. Daluyong failed many students. Not just us. They opened SocSci 1 so the Octoberians can catch up. Hey, handsome, you're missing some requirements. Sorry. My reg form, and my money. Is this all? This won't do. Just come back when you've completed the requirements. Next in line, please. Next person's up. Requirements? Wait. What do you mean "requirements"? What's missing? Give me a moment. This one's pushy. Come back when you have all the requirements. You are disrupting the line. All right, so you're not clueless... Look, we're all wearing an ID. Don't you have one? ID? It's just an ID, okay? I'll bring it back tomorrow. Just let me pay now. Please. Go, then. Feel free to leave but you're not yet enrolled. Hey. Miss, what's your name? -Ana. -Ana, I really have to enroll right now. My job is starting soon. And I have no choice but to get this right now. So, please. Okay, I'll bring it back tomorrow. I'll give you the money now, it'll be okay. Is this okay? It isn't. It really won't do. You know I'm just doing my job also. This is for enrollment. This is for school. Half of the school has this anyway. Doesn't matter. But an ID is required, which you don't have now. We can't process incomplete requirements. I'm gonna give you the money now and bring it tomorrow-- -Doesn't even matter. -You're being a nag! Security! What are you talking about? It's just money. Guard! -I'll give you an ID tomorrow! -Guard, he's being a nuisance. -Sir, let's go outside. -Take care of that. I have no choice. I have to enroll in this school. Next in line! -Ma'am? -Yes? You should come with us, Ma'am. Why do I have to? I don't have anything to do with it. I wasn't getting involved. Please, I don't like it there. -You know, you're annoying. -It's just an ID. -I've been coming here for three days. -You are so persistent. I'll bring the money tomorrow. -I shouldn't even be here! -I don't see what your problem is. -I keep telling you you don't have an ID. -You started this. Okay. We wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for you. What happened anyway? This one was making a scene at the registrar earlier. He thinks he's some hotshot. Calm down. One at a time. Pretty boy here was so annoying. I apologize. He is missing some requirements that's why I cannot process his enrollment. Are you finished? Or are you gonna keep going? Why do you keep speaking in English? Don't you speak Tagalog? Okay, let's sort this out. Since you're the one who needs extra credits, what I want you to do is to teach Pads how to speak Tagalog. Do that. And you, Pads... You can go ahead and enroll. Sir? What do we have to do to pass your subject? The usual. Go to class, listen in class, don't sleep in class. And don't bring down the library shelves, destroying school property. Sir, what do we need for that family project? Well, I can't be the one to pass your subjects for you. You know what, guys. Be grateful. Many failed the subject, that's why it's being made available again. Thank you, sir. You speak Tagalog now? Long story. All right, guys. I'm gonna see all of your former classmates in SocSci 2. See you later, repeaters! Lover boy. What's up, lover boy? You're good at speaking Tagalog now. So what's our plan with the project? Where do we do Family Day? And are we serving food? Can we pull this off? Dude, this is the food. Kikiam! Sofia, forgive me. You got dragged into this. And... sorry I couldn't spend time with you. It's okay. I've moved on. Moved on? Wait. That was fast. Can we perhaps talk it over? Sofia, I want you back. Sorry, Tom. But I already told you I've moved on. Sofia, please? Tom, our parents are here. Please don't embarrass me. Hurry! What's your problem? You're already hurting me. Calm down. This is just a game. You smell like alcohol. No, I don't. Why do you care? Hey, you two. Stop acting like kids. -Mind your own business. -Hey! She may look like a-- Foxy... She is a loving wife. Dean, I enrolled my son at this school because it's supposed to be progressive. And this? This is elementary stuff in Europe. Mrs. Kaiser, we were all just invited here by your son and his friends. This is their project with Mandy-- I mean, Sir Mandy. Which subject is that? Social Science 1. Social Science 1? -He got the highest mark on that course. -Yes, he did. Wait, I remember receiving a class card that says Benj has already passed that course. And I remember Tom gave me one, too. Destino? Yes, sir? Is this true? The thing is... You know, I expected more from you. Family Day is over. Mandy. Sir Mandy, let's talk about it in my office. Thomas, come on. -We'll talk at home. -Benjamin! You're adding to my problems. Our company's rocky and you're not being any help. Excuse me, what's happening? The boys got caught faking their grades on their class cards. Ma'am, excuse me. That isn't like me at all. I'm sorry, man. It was my idea to fake the class cards. It wasn't yours entirely. We agreed to it. What a hassle. Sofia also told her dad that I broke my leg. I got a double black eye. Triple, because... I'm grounded. So... Bikini Bottom Fest is tomorrow night, guys. What's it going to be? Still in? Aren't you grounded? Grounded. But whatever. So, who's game? You're something else, Hans. You don't let anything stop you. I mean, come on. The way I see it, we go or not, we're already in so much trouble. I mean... if any of you guys are having second thoughts... It's all right. I can just go on my own. But... it would just be so much more fun if the crew came with me. I'm game. -Okay, I'm in too. -Me too. Pads? So, let me get this clear. Are you going to sneak out? Man, are we going to keep Hans hanging? That's what I like about you, Benjamin Destino. You're our hero. Aren't you coming? When did I ever say no to you? I'm all in. Where was this? -Let's go dance. -Yeah. Nitpicky! Flowers? Thank you. You're pretty. Is that for your blog, again? So what if it is? Okay, I'll try it. It's your turn. No! Hi! Go away! Fine. Gosh. You did amazing. -So proud of you. -Thank you! -That was awesome. -Thank you! Babe, I'm sorry, for whatever I did. I was hoping we could work things out. Thomas. It's my fault also. I felt too attached to my image. Sorry, Tom. But that can't happen. Why? Is it because of this a-hole? I'm better than him. Besides, you have a better future with me. Bro, Sofia said no. Just get away from here. What are you talking about? Jordan and I are very close. He isn't the one who replaced you. So you really have replaced me. Bro, stop. You don't have to worry about me. Because I'm gay as F. What? You're gay? Yes. But we all shower together in the locker room. Also, you saw-- Never mind. Sofia. So you replaced me. With whom? With Yassi. Yassi? She's just a freshman. And, Sofia, she's a girl. Yes, Tom. I like girls, too. Happy now? I suggest you go home. You're drunk. Let's go! Ana, are you okay? Why are you here? I'm just getting some air. Go back to Kim. She might get lost. Kim? She managed to reach the Philippines on her own. You expect she can't go back to Manila by herself? Pads, what are you on? What's this? Why did you bring me here if you're with your ex? Are you jealous? Geez, no. Suit yourself. Go away! That's in English so leave me alone. See you later. Kate. Where's Nat? Over there. Talking to someone. Here's five hundred pesos. I don't owe you anything anymore. Bro, thank you. I love you, bro. Wait. Give me that. Read it again lest you forget I already paid my debt. James. Read! Five hundred pesos. James. Read. You know what. I'll go ahead. You might get shot for being on drugs. I will wait for them, bro. Good luck. There he is. What? Are you okay? Where have you been? Did you miss me? I paid my debt to James. Bro, come with us. Don't try to refuse so we won't have a problem. What did I do to you? Where are you taking me? -Hey! -Don't interfere. He didn't do anything! Wait. Don't interfere. This is a police operation. I saw your friend pay a drug pusher. Wait. I just paid a debt. I didn't know he sold drugs. Come on, officer. Maybe we can just talk about this. Are you paying us off too? Arrest them, too. I don't want to go! Boss, I wasn't doing anything wrong. Chief, let us out. Chief, we had nothing to do with it. Please have pity. This is all my fault. I shouldn't have brought you guys. It's not your fault. We all wanted to come. My dad will kill me. Chief, please. Chief, let us out. Chief. What are you doing here? You prick. This is your fault. Tom. Stop fighting! What? Are you on his side? -You're getting on my nerves, too. -Tom, we're on the same team. Nothing will happen even if we beat him up. Damn it! Sofia was right. My life got out of control when I met you guys. Shut up, bro. You're drunk. My mom was right. I shouldn't have gotten attached. Hell, I didn't even want to be friends with you guys. I don't get you. Out of the five of us, you're doing well the most. You always get what you want. What about us? The hell is your problem? I should punch you right now. Wait. Wait! At least the troubles are pouring in all at once. It's one less mouth to feed when I'm gone at least. Positive thinking at a time like this. You have a point. I'm sure my mother is disappointed. Disappointed. We're basically dead at this point. We got in way over our heads. Goodbye, Deutschland. Dude, your mom spoiled you way too much to be mad at you. In Australia, my family can't even stand me. And now I'm stuck. I'm stuck with my brother forever. You know, the truth is, I'm really grateful for everything that's happened. It's all worth it. If not for you guys, I'd be nothing but a robot. Like my dad who's got nothing but business plans on his head. You're all such bad influences. Ouch. But we're good. Sir, can you just let us out? Hey. Are you all right? Chief, he's foaming in the mouth. What's up with that? Chief, let me out. Get out of the way! Damn, this kid's overdosed. What did you take? I can't remember, sir. What are you doing here? You're paid up. Who are you with? -You don't know them? -No, sir. Sir, let me out of here. There are people after me. You need to help me. I promise I'll start fresh. I'll change my life and quit my odd jobs. Okay, let me handle it. I'll help you. I'll arrest those masters as long as you assist us. Yes, I will help you. I'm sorry. I really am to blame for all this. No. No, it was me. I invited them all to come. This is exactly what I warned you about. That's what you get for hanging out with these clowns. Wait. Be careful about what you say. I'll beat you up. You started it! Dad. Enough. Okay? You don't have to drag their families into this. I know what I did was wrong. We were wrong to not listen to you. But we are all meant to make mistakes. If you must blame someone, blame me. The other families can deal with their own. So, please, Dad. You're talking back at me in front of these people. I forbid you to go out with your so-called friends. Let's go. You'll hear from my attorney to clear this out. Let's go! Son, are you all right? You weren't like that before. What the hell is wrong with you? I don't understand what's gotten into you. Did I do anything wrong? All I want is for us to go back to Germany and live our lives just like before. Mom. I'll let the issue with the ticket pass. The cost of that isn't a joking matter. But what is it this time? I don't want to go back to Germany anymore. What? You keep telling me that you want to live the life that we used to live there. What life? We don't have a life there anymore. Stop living in the past. Dad left us. Look. I don't know why I have been acting out recently. But maybe it's because I'm scared. Scared that I'm going to fall in love with the people. Scared that I'm gonna fall in love with the place. I'm just confused as to why you don't like it here. I mean, after all, you come from here. Right? I'm sorry, son. I thought you wanted to go back. I want to stay here, but... I guess I was trying to convince myself otherwise by projecting it to you. You don't have to say anything. It's my turn. That was a foul move. Dad, I finally beat you. You're already amazing. Dad, you know, I finally get what you're saying. Which one? About having a fallback. Since I broke my leg, it took a long time for me to be able to play again. Sofia and I broke up, too. I felt so... helpless. I didn't have a safety net for times when I would fall. Now you know. Start weaving the net that can catch you. You'll fall and fail many times. Prepare your safety net. You'll get back up faster if you're prepared. -Hey, ugly! -Horseface! What is that? -What is that? -Nothing. Let me see. You're going to get in trouble with Mom, Nat. What now? Should I start packing your bags? You know, I know someone from a gang in case you want to earn a couple of bucks. I'm worried and you have the nerve to joke around. I'm sure it'll be fine. Tell Mom. I know I really need to find a job. This is embarrassing for Mom and Dad. Here's my advice. There's a time and place to be serious. It's not all laughs. I'll do better next time. I promise. Leigh, sorry. I have to tell you something. I'm not joining the talent show anymore. After what happened at Bikini Bottom, Dad has become doubly strict. Nothing I can do about it. I knew it. Tom was right for calling you a coward. Benj, where is Young D? If you're going to be a coward, I'm not. I'll join the talent show by myself! Suit yourself. Leigh, please. Leigh? Leigh! Channing, where are you going? Brother... I'm sorry. I just can't take this anymore. You treat me like I'm not even family. I know you just kept me around because you needed help around the house. I didn't ask for you to take me in. Am I right? I offered you to stay here so that you can grow up as a responsible young man. I'm sorry if I have been hard on you. But... We are family. And if you still want to leave, then I won't stop you. Just promise me we can still keep in touch. Actually, is it okay if I stay here? I mean, if you don't mind? No, Channing. We are family. This is your house, too. This is our house. I got you, bro. Hey, guys, have you seen Channing? I was supposed to meet him here. I'm here! Excuse me, guys. I'll just talk to Kim. -Are we good? -Yeah. So, what's up, hon? Kimberly. You have to stop calling me that. It's been three years since we broke up. And, you know, I have moved on. I'm sorry. So, I moved all the way here for nothing? I came here to start a new life with you. I'm sorry, Kim, but... Three years ago, I would have killed to be with you. But... Things have changed. It's nice here in the Philippines but... I'm sure you'll find someone who deserves you more than I do. I hope so. You've really changed, Channing. But I'm happy for you. Now that you mentioned it, I think that I can finally admit to myself that I was just in love with our memory. And that's exactly what it is. Just a memory. Bros, you need to come with me. Leigh's majorly pissed at me. I need to see her at the competition. Please? All right, I'm coming. But, Benj, aren't you going to get in trouble with your dad again? Why are you here? This isn't even our mix. Didn't you tell me to follow my heart? That's what I'm doing. Just go with your instincts, and trust me. Are you guys excited? All right, guys. This is the moment we've all been waiting for. I have the results here in my hand, the winner of the talent search competition. Are you guys excited? All right. Ready! And with an average score of 99.9, the winner of the talent search competition this year is none other than Benj and Leigh! Let's give them a round of applause. Give it to them. Give it now. Congratulations! Thank you! Thank you so much for joining. Thank you. Thank you so much. Excuse me. -Hi. -Hey. Sofia, sorry. I just don't want to lose the friendship we've built since we were kids. I've come to terms with the way we are now. I'll man up this time. It's okay, Tom. Just stay out of trouble, okay. You will always be my first love. Pads. Don't start with me. You can't fool me. You keep waving at that Kim. Isn't she going home yet? Ana, shush. No other woman shall possess my heart. Only you. I'll chop wood for you and fill water buckets. You must be a trap. 'Cause I fell for you. Hey, you are so corny! But you make it work. Wait! What about Kim? Let her be. She's a big girl. I introduced her to someone else. Are you still mad? This is for you. Do I have to share this with Kim? You have it all to yourself. Even my heart. You are enough. Enough! You're so cheeky. Kate! What happened? You're making my head spin. Kate, there's something I want to tell you. Just blurt it out or I'm walking out. Wait! Wait! Can I get out of your friend zone? What? I like you. There, I said it. I've liked you for a long time. I've been wanting to tell you. But nobody ever takes me seriously so I was afraid you'd just laugh at me. This is the first time I've felt this way because I'm usually timid. But I knew I'd regret not telling you how I feel. So now, I mustered all the courage to ask if... you'd like... to be my girlfriend. I already knew. Really? So are we official? No way! I just agreed to be courted. You're in such a hurry. Don't you like me? After everything I told you. Did you hear me say that I don't? -You seem mad. -No, I'm fine with that. Like what Albert Einstein used to say, "Work with what you have." Here. Listen to this. I know... Hey... Just shut up, Hans! You were never good with words anyway. Yeah! Look at that! Solid! Look, it's as big as you. Benjamin Destino! Dad, let me explain. Dad, this is what I love doing. I'm sorry I hid it from you, but I promise I'll still be an engineer for you. You did well. I was looking for you in your room and saw the poster. I came straight here. I'm sorry I dragged your dreams down. I didn't want you to end up like me. What do you mean, Dad? I'm sorry if I pressured you. I just got so stressed about my projects. Just because we won, doesn't mean we should slack off. For sure. But I'm truly grateful, Leigh. Because... you called me out when I was being a coward. You pushed me to fight for what I love. And most of all, you trusted me. Even when I lost faith in myself. You're really amazing. You just lack some grit. What becomes of Young D? Well... As for Young D, I'll come clean. I'm Benjamin Destino. But I'll keep the channel. I won't let go of my 200,300 subscribers. I think that went down to 200,299 subscribers. Wow. How did you know? You were stalking me! No, I actually unfollowed. Your channel's corny now. It's lost its mystique. I think it's more fun to be one of your haters. And do you know what I do to people I hate? What? The suspense is killing me. This is beyond me. Sir? Why did you make us stay behind? Guys. I have something to tell you. You guys passed with flying colors. Yeah, all right! Thank you. Thank you. We didn't fail! Here comes the always-late Thomas Florida, Jr. -You're by yourself? -Can't be helped. I've got to be hashtag "single-forever" for now. Don't worry, Tom. I'll hook you up. Is that so? Pads, such a flirt. All right, now we're all here. Let's have a "groufie."
