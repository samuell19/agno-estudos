So I just flew in from detroit and landed here in l.A. And oh, my gosh, this is real. I can't believe it. I'm so excited to see what I can do. Oh, my god! Oh, my god! Wow. Walking into this place reminds me of home, It reminds me that I'm ready to get the game on And to start baking. Oh. Hi, bakers, welcome to "holiday baking championship." Alright, you made it, It's all about to begin... The mouth-watering, Seasonal sweets, the fun, the stress, And it's all going to be worth it Because one of you will walk out of here With $25,000, A chance to be featured on the food network kitchen app, And the title of holiday baking champion. Let's get to baking already, let's go. - Yeah! - Yeah! For your first preheat of the season, We're going to kick things off with a kind of dessert That people are embracing like crazy at home... Quick bread. Okay. To be honest, I'm not thrilled. I don't really do too many breads all that often. I'm a cake guy, so I'm definitely Outside of my comfort zone already. And since this is a championship, We don't want the kind of old-school quick breads That impress your neighbors. No, we want festive. We want decorative... Quick bread wreaths. - Ooh! - Ooh! Alright. Now take a look around the kitchen. There are 12 mini wreaths And they're hung all around. Now, when time starts, you're going to grab one To discover what flavor quick bread you got to bake. Now, bakers, trust me when I tell you Doing well in the preheat has never Been more important than today. Oh. In a first-ever in the holiday baking championship, The least successful baker will be leaving us After the preheat. - Oh. - Wow. Your place in this competition Is on the line right away. Okay, we're giving you two hours To create a festively decorated quick bread wreath And your baking time starts... Now. All-spice. Okay. Chocolate orange. My name is aubrey shaffner. I'm an executive pastry chef from baltimore, maryland. For me, holiday traditions are very busy. We celebrate hanukkah on my mom's side. We celebrate christmas on my dad's side. And my birthday is christmas eve. So if that wasn't an eventful 24 hours To you people, I don't know what is. So I got chocolate orange, So I'm going to actually do three chocolates, Blonde roasted, dark chocolate, And white chocolate all combined. Today I'm making a triple-chocolate Orange quick bread wreath. A quick bread is a bread that's usually leavened Through a quicker leavener, Which is like baking soda or baking powder Rather than long proofed By like some kind of fresh yeast or instant yeast. I mix my first batter By starting with my blonde chocolate. I want this to be really orange focused. Once I have all of those mixed together, I start on my second batter. So I make a dark chocolate quick bread batter. I'm definitely going to use a molded pan. And I'm thinking right now I'm going to do a couple minis. I feel like at the holidays you want something That's like people can pick up. They don't have to do a lot of cutting. I just put my two different batters in a piping bag And I swirl them together right into the pan. My name is jon buatti. I'm 16 years old from auburn, new hampshire, And I own my own bakery out of manchester, new hampshire. Big jon, what flavor did you get? I got citrus ginger. Feel good about it? Uh, I've been hot and cold. I didn't like it at first. It's coming around on it and I'm not liking it too much. You got to him them everywhere with ginger. I love a good moscow mule. Around the holidays, I like to make them With some tennessee honey, splash of cranberry, A little bit of lemon, and of course, the ginger beer. A couple more and then we're good. I'm making a ginger quick bread with candied ginger, Candied lemon, candied orange, and some dried cranberries. Let's go, baby. I'm gonna need way more spice in these. My biggest concern for the bake Is really making sure that the flavors Are going to pull through. This is going to be interesting. I've never tried this method before. You got to get in the oven. An hour and 15 minutes left, bakers. Man, oh, man, The time goes fast, doesn't it? Ho ho ho, everyone. I am the santa from atlanta. I'm jeff gray. I'm from atlanta, georgia, And I live there with my husband and my corgi. You want to come with me in the suitcase And try out the desserts? I worked for 33 years in the advertising industry And about a year ago I gave it all up to become a home baker. I got into baking just, you know, over the years, You know, watching my grandmothers, Watching my mother bake. She didn't bake a whole lot, But she always baked at the holidays. And once they passed, I was keeping, You know, family recipes alive at the holidays. All this new equipment. Fun. Right now it's kind of a hobby. And winning would give me the confidence Probably to grow it and take it in other directions. I got a cranberry orange quick bread... Two of my favorite flavors. Not worked with them together. I'm making an orange and cranberry quick bread With candied oranges and orange glaze. Jonathan, I used that bag of cranberries. I think there's still more in there. I'm going to put whole cranberries Inside the quick bread for a quick pop of sour With the sweet orange. I'm working with these pans here, So I'm hoping to make them a little more of an elegant Round wreath with these little starbursts. Alright. And then decoration on top. Hopefully use some bay leaves for the green And some other things I need to find out about. And I hope this turns out. Nothing ventured, nothing gained. Hi, lashonda. Hello. How are you? You're so beautiful. Aw, you know, I was going to say the same thing about you. Oh, well, thank you! My name is lashonda sanford, I am from newport news, virginia, And I own scratch bakery. Pears? Who want to make with pears? Who wants to do this? This is awful. The flavor I get is spiced pear, And I automatically think ginger and pear. I am making a spiced pear quick bread With a ginger cinnamon reduction. I'm going to put them on to the platter. I'm going to arrange them in a circle of a wreath. This could be super spicy. I don't know. I don't make things with ginger. I want a piece of pear in every bite So the judges can taste pear flavor Bursting through when they bite it. I'm taking like five crystallized ginger Because I don't want them to say, "I cannot taste the ginger." Going in, baby! All we can do is pray. Can I borrow the nutmeg real quick? No! Please? Thank you. I'll bring it right back. Hey. What's up, guys? Welcome to my kitchen. My name is jamaal. I am from atlanta, georgia. I'm a pastry chef and single and ready to jingle. So lame. Let's give it a taste. Ah, that's rude. Here, first one's for you. Got a winner. Being from the south, my baking style Is definitely all about comfort. All you need is just a little bit of butter and maybe A couple of pieces of bacon. And, you know, You got a delicious start to whatever you're doing. What do you have for ginger, boss? Just the crystallized and the... yeah. Alright, well, I have ground ginger if you need it. Okay, cool If I win the holiday baking championship, It just might get me a boyfriend because they say The best way to a man's heart is through his stomach. Ginger citrus. My flavor that I pulled is ginger citrus, Which I'm immediately excited about just because That's two of my favorite flavors. And they work so well together. I'm making a blood orange ginger quick bread with a blood orange Ginger glaze and a little bit of candied orange peel And fresh ginger. What am I going to do with this? I'm using just a pinch of salt just to balance All the sweetness that's going on in the quick bread. I don't want to use too much salt just because I don't want it to turn into a savory pastry. I use a little bit of dried ginger just to drive The ginger flavor home and just a little bit of nutmeg Just because it's not the holidays without nutmeg. Smells good. Not in the oven at all, anywhere near it. I'm jonathan peregrino. I am a pastry chef from detroit, michigan. Calm down. You got this. I am actually new into the food industry. About two years ago I decided to leave corporate america After 15 years and I really just wanted to follow the dream And the passion. Sure, that looks good. I got cranberry and orange, So I'm making a buttermilk dried cranberry and blood orange Quick bread, a little bit different And add a little bit of blood orange puree. I'm also adding orange zest to the batter To add additional orange flavor. I then mix my wet ingredients and my dry ingredients. Okay, this looks a little weird. This looks a lot drier than it should. A lot of the quick bread batters that I've done, Typically they're very light and almost are runny. My batter is looking more like a biscuit than a quick bread. This does not look right. This does not look right. A little more cream. Throw another egg in there. Oh, gosh, this looks not right. Oh, lord, I'm just hoping it sets. Hopefully it's not going to be a dry. Yeah, that's my question is whether or not They are going to come out dry. Please do your job. I'm freaking out. Aaah! One hour left, bakers. Show us your festive side with these quick bread wreaths. I don't know about that. My batter is not looking like how it should, and I am worried. Whew, doggie! And remember, bakers, one of you's Going to receive an advantage And somebody also is going to receive a goodbye. This is a little bit more biscuit-y, But I think the flavor tastes really good right now. And I think I can add more flavor in the decoration. Megan, you okay, baby? I'm good, girl. How are you? Whoo! I'm alright, girl. I don't even know. That's right. Back of the room, right? Come on, girl, we got this. I'm megan rountree, I'm from keller, texas, And I own legacy cakes. Let's get creative. I got chocolate orange quick bread. So I'm going to do a chocolate-based quick bread With some orange zest in there, Some candied oranges and then some extra chocolate chips, So it's good and chocolate. The chocolate chips give you a good punch of chocolate, The candied oranges... - Alright. ...They kind of have like a gummy texture, So it changes up the texture within the bread. And then the orange zest is just like true natural orange flavor. And that's exactly what I want. Hey, jeffrey, am I older than you? Yes. Thanks a lot, pal. Hey, but I'm right behind you. My name is eva roberts. I'm from spokane, washington, And I own a bakery called just american desserts, Which I have been the proprietor for 35 years. I'm 61 years old. However, I feel like I'm still 25 in my mind. So it's really weird. I feel like I'm the same age As some of these people, but I realize I'm old enough to be their mother. Ugh! Get these babies peeled. I have spiced pear. So I'm making a spiced pear quick bread With a spiced fondant icing And then do a holly berry design on the top. Everything's better with a little port, right? I decide, first of all, to poach pears in port To get some flavors, that mulling spice flavors So that they're cooked enough and I can chop them up And add them to my batter. Don't want to overbeat this. The problem with the quick breads. My inspiration for this spicy pear quick bread Comes from all the cream puff wreaths I make During the holiday time at the bakery And with my grandchildren. They're the apple of my eye. Let's get this show on the road here. What is it again, lasandra? Lashondra? Is that your name? Me? Yeah. no. My name's julianna. I'm not lashondra. Sorry, my bad! My bad! I was like "what was that?" My name is lorenzo delgado. And I am 23 years old And I work as a pastry chef in miami beach, florida. So I got maple pecan. Girl, god is on my side, Because I feel super comfortable with those ingredients. Using a lot. I'm making a pecan quick bread base With a maple glaze on top With some chocolate drizzle and candied pecans. I'm using the square pan because do I want to be Like everybody else and just grab another circle pan? I want to make it a new innovative wreath. Into the oven. Oh, peeler out here? Oh. That's better. Aw. Wasted so much time. My name is kess eshun, I'm 40 years old. I'm a pastry chef and I live in frisco, texas. That is pretty good. Yes. That's supposed to be a christmas tree, right? It's really good. I'm married and I have three boys And I came over to the united states To go to the university for computer science. And I hated it. But my parents were like, "you can go to culinary school." So I drove to the culinary school one day And I enrolled in culinary school. And here I am, a pastry chef. I'm here to prove to my kids That you should follow your dreams. And to my parents, I never gave up. And look at me now, I'm here competing on a baking championship. That's good enough. I get apple cinnamon, So I'm going to make apple cinnamon quick bread And apple butter cinnamon cream cheese frosting. Oh, good. The first thing that came to my mind Was my delicious banana quick bread, Which I can make in my sleep. So I was like, "okay, instead of banana, I can caramelize apples and, you know, add the cinnamon And make the same quick bread, and hopefully it works." I want to get this in the oven really fast. Whew! As my pan cake is baking, I started working on my cheese cheese frosting. We going to make it amazing. I decided to add apple butter And cinnamon to my cream cheese frosting. I wanted to make sure there's a little bit of cinnamon And a little bit of apple. Ooh, double yolk! It's good luck, right? My name is kristina stephenson, And I'm a pastry chef in spokane, washington. Pecans. I get maple pecan. So I am going to make a pecan quick bread With a maple cream cheese swirl, A maple whiskey glaze, and a pecan crumble. Oh, you know what I forgot to add? I forgot the leavening. I combine my dry ingredients and my wet ingredients And then I folded in the toasted pecans. And then I set it aside so I can make my cream cheese filling. Let's get that softening. So that I can swirl it into the batter. Alright. Into the oven. Bakers, 45 minutes left. Quick bread wreaths to stay in this competition. Julianna. Julianna, you just stole my thunder And ran in front of the camera. Sorry! Such a camera hog. Everybody, julianna wants to be on tv. How'd you know? Jesse's really good looking. He's really cute but I'm married so I can't do that. No. My name is julianna from champaign, illinois. I work in health care industry as a product manager And baking is my hobby. So I'm going to make a banana bread But with applesauce and a lot of cinnamon. So I get apple cinnamon, which I love. I am going to make an apple cinnamon quick bread Stuffed with apple vanilla caramel Topped with apple cinnamon buttercream. This is a quick bread, so it's just going To mix everything in there. This looks a little shy. Hope for the best. 350. In we go. Now that the quick bread is in the oven, I decide to start on my caramel. Sugar. Okay, let's go, sugar. Let's go. Well, the sugar was sticking to the sides of the pot And it was not melting on the side. So I have sugar melting. It's not going too well. Hopefully it'll come back to life. I have no clue what is happening at this point. My sugar is not... oh! You know what, no, I'm not going to do this. I cannot serve crystallized caramel or burnt caramel To the judges at all. Man, I feel stupid. 30 minutes left, bakers, quick bread wreaths. Someone's going home. Come on. So I'm trying to make this caramel And nothing is going my way. I don't want to redo you. You know what? No, I'm not going to do this. There's going to be an elimination on this challenge, And it definitely scares me. Man, I feel stupid. So I decide to get a sauce pan, Which has more surface area which will melt more evenly. I heat up the cream, which has vanilla and cinnamon in it. It's looking good now. I'm liking this. I add my butter and then I use an immersion blender To blend it a little bit to make it smooth and soft. I'm happy with this. I'm a mess right now. So my cranberry orange quick bread looks a little bit dry. It is definitely lighter and fluffier than A biscuit would normally be. So I think I'm going to be okay. And I think adding the glaze on top Is going to help soften the outside of it. I'm making a blood orange glaze. So I mix it to a very thin consistency So it comes off of the mini quick breads. Trying to make sure to see these little imprints of the rose. The inspiration behind my wreath is around the holidays, I'll try to find like a bouquet, especially a bouquet of roses Just to give to my mom when I come to see her. You got some big ones over there, aubrey. I know. I know. Mine look tiny compared to yours. This is the holiday. Go big or go home. That's what all the girls say. Now it's time to decorate and assemble. Okay, so what am I going to do for decoration? When I was in middle school, We lived in virginia near colonial williamsburg, And the homes would be decorated With magnolia leaves and fresh fruit. So my first thought is to try to recreate one of those wreaths In baked goods. Making a glaze to go on top of this And using a little bit of an orange liqueur That I put into the bread. So hopefully it'll bring another kick to it. I arranged my quick breads in a circular pattern. I'm going to use candied oranges, Whole cranberries and bay leaves in part of my decoration. Now comes the fun part. Let's get a glaze a-going. Once I'm ready to start decorating, I get my chocolate orange quick bread leaves Out of the pan and then I'm going to dip them So that the orange glaze can start setting up. There we go! Cute, cute, cute. In order to add another dimension to my wreath, I want to add in some chocolate ornaments So I melt some red chocolate and I use a sphere mold. So perfect. It smells good over here. Yeah. Thanks! So to make my maple pecan quick bread looks like a wreath I'm going to make a pecan streusel That I'm going to color green To get that color and festivity in there. So I combine oats, flour, brown sugar and some toasted pecans, A pinch of salt and some green full color. Wrap it up in plastic wrap and I throw it In the blast chiller to chill So that it'll be hard enough for me to be able to grate. What are you? Bourbon whiskey! I grab the whiskey and I come back And I make a really quick glaze, Dip them into the glaze, And then I proceed to dip them into the crumble And they come out just like I was hoping for. Ooh, what is that? It is a streusel topping. That is so cute. Thank you. This one's for you, nancy. For my wreath, I'm making a cinnamon whiskey glaze. After I finish with the syrup, I start working on my tuiles. You know what, nancy is going to see this And she's going to say it has no color. So I got to add some food color. I realized that there's no cutouts of leaves, So I literally had to make my own with acetate. And then I just started smearing on that tuile batter, And then baked it in the oven until I got some color. Pretty good. A bit of whiskey. So I go over, I grab some whiskey and I grab A little bit of ginger syrup throw that in my buttercream. A bit more whiskey never hurt. Ooh! A good splashing. Alright, bakers, 5 minutes left. Can't go home today. Ooh! I'm going to add a little bit of apple butter and water And make an apple cinnamon syrup with it. Just going to brush it and let it soak in a little bit. It will infuse my cake to prevent it from drying up. And I place it on my cake board and start frosting. Oh, I'm shaking. I'm shaking. Whew! Julianna, what's going on over there? That looks delicious. It's a lot of caramel. I'm trying to control it. That's a lot of caramel. But I'm not sure if it'll work. My decorating plan is to take all the quick breads Laid out in a circle, coat the whole wreath all around. My hands are shaking. And then place some flowers on top. Okay, that's more like a wreath. Look at that. Ain't that beautiful? I'm going winter wonderland for this year. I get my cookie cutters, I get a snowflake, I get a snowman, and I just start cutting those Out of my modeling chocolate and I just start painting away, Trying to spray a little bit of silver dust on there To give it sort of a sparkly glowy effect. Jon, what's up with the bowl? I am trying to make sure that it's a nice, clean center In the middle of my wreath, just like that. Let's go. 45 seconds. In my last minute, I realize I have no proper color. I had to put something on this plate, So I throw the coating chocolate in the bag And I pipe probably the worst bow I've ever made. 10 seconds left. Hurry up! Time's up! - Whoo! Nice job, guys. Oh, my god. So judges, for this preheat challenge, Our bakers had two hours To create a festively decorated quick bread wreath. Let's bring in lorenzo. - Alright. - Oh! What up? - What's up? Way to make an entrance. Okay! Of course, remember our judges, nancy fuller, Duff goldman, and welcome, carla hall. Tell us about what you decided to make. Okay, so luckily I got maple pecan. So I have a pecan quick bread with a maple glaze icing With a little bit of cinnamon whiskey, nancy. Ooh! I got you, girl. And then I got some vanilla tuiles With some candied pecans. As you can see, I went for a nontraditional type of wreath. I went for the square pans. On the actual tray itself, It's supposed to be a door with a little christmas wreath on it. I love it. I love that you thought it through you. You have sold me on the square wreath. I'm doing a square wreath this year. When we sell the square wreath, it's because of you. Yes. Definitely getting maple. Yeah? Yeah. Really nice. I did get the pecan. Okay. I did get the maple. Yes. But I didn't get enough of it! I knew it was coming. I knew it was coming. Okay. Alright, lorenzo. Thank you, man. Awesome. Thank you guys. - Thank you. - Bye! Hey, lashonda. Oh, my god, You're actually here in the flesh. I was thinking there was going to be like Little stand up dolls, but it's really you. So what flavor did you get? Spiced pear. What I've made for you today was a spiced pear quick bread With a spiced ginger cinnamon reduction glaze With some fondant decoration and some sliced pears And some powdered sugar on top. So you have these, like, beautiful cakes with the glaze, Like, dripping down and they're like really organic. And then you have bright red fondant And bright green fondant. I could hear nancy say "color." - Thank you. - Yes, absolutely. I mean, the color is important, but you want to, like, Blend those together like that, Kind of like make a little more sense. Okay. I just can't say enough about the flavor. And the spice is so well balanced. I actually love the raw pear. I find the cake to be a little sweet, But because of the raw pear, It actually resets your palate to go back in. Lashonda, great stuff. Thank you so much. Thank you. Hey, guys. Hi, jeff! Santa's here! Yes, that's right, I was dubbed this morning santa of atlanta, So I guess that's my new nickname. Santa of atlanta. I love that. Well, I got cranberry orange. So it's an orange cranberry quick bread And it's got whole cranberries and orange zest, Orange juice inside, a little bit of orange liqueur, Topped with candied orange peel, A little bit of buttercream and a drizzle of a glaze That has some orange liqueur in it as well. Mmm! I think it's very festive. I'm thinking it's a little more thanksgiving Than it is christmas. Okay. I like this a lot more Than I thought I was going to. Oh, that's great. I like the orange. I really like that chew on there. I think your cake, it's not quite as like Just tender as I wanted. Okay. But your flavors are really great. The cranberry orange flavor overall really works. And the cranberries that are inside give you That a little bit of bright. Alright. Thank you, jeffrey. -Thank you. -Thank you. -Thank you. Kristina, hey. Hi! It's really you guys. I pulled the maple pecan, So I have made a pecan quick bread with a maple cream cheese Filling, a maple whiskey glaze, And then I have a pecan streusel. One of the things I love about christmas Is all the wreaths and the trees. And I think looking at yours, It just feels like really kind of woodsy. Yeah. The yellow kind of like wakes you up a little bit, Though, like. It's not my favorite bow I've ever made. It's a bow? Yeah. It's a pop of color! Damn, nancy! It's an accent. I'm sorry. They love me because I tell it like it is. Yes. I kind of expected that reaction from you. I think that the bow looks like a flying animal went by And pbht, and kept going. Like I went the forest theme. Oh, dear. It's time to taste. You have wonderful, wonderful pecan flavor. Thank you. Well, I get the maple in the glaze, If you're only eating the top of the cake. I actually love how it's baked. I just wish... maybe you needed a simple syrup. The sides and how crunchy they are are great. You just needed to introduce something moist. Alright, kristina, thank you. Thank you so much. - Thank you! - Thank you very much. Hi, jonathan. Hey, judges. - Hi, jonathan! - Oh, my god. Oh! Ohhh! I got cranberry and orange. So what I made for you today is a dried cranberry And blood orange buttermilk quick bread. I think that the green is a little vibrant. It doesn't say holiday to me. Right now you have some circular roses That are the start of a wreath. But then now you have to decorate it. Jonathan, honey, I think we need to change the recipe Because I think that it's way too dense. All of the flavors that you promised, the candied orange, The blood orange, the cranberries, I got. What did this look like when you were putting it in the pan? It was a little thicker than I'm used to seeing. I had tried to lighten up a little bit with a little bit Extra of the milk and just another egg. Ooh, the other egg. Might have been the egg. The other egg. - Alright, jonathan, thanks. - Thanks. Thanks, jonathan. The texture was way too dense. It was way too thick. Very bready. - Yeah, it was really bready. - This is the first time In a holiday baking championship That someone's going to be eliminated in the preheat. So if I get sent home because of this, I'm going to be super disappointed. Judges, holiday decorated quick bread wreaths. Hey, guys. Hi, jamaal! So I got citrus ginger, so this is a ginger And blood orange quick bread. So there's a ginger and orange glaze on top And candied ginger and orange peel. It reads like a plate of cookies to me, Though, and it doesn't say wreath. I'm getting the citrus, I'm getting the blood orange. There's something missing. I need a punch of flavor. I think it's salt. Did you put salt in? I did it, just like a quarter teaspoon. A quarter teaspoon? Probably could have used a little bit more. What is really nice is that I'm definitely getting ginger. I'm definitely getting the citrus. Alright, jamaal, thanks, man. Thank you guys so much. - Thank you. - Thank you! Hi, eva. Hello. I love your hair. It's warm in here, and I thought I'm just going to be dripping. The tall jon and he goes, "well, I have some extra bandanas," So I'm going to go back to spokane Eventually looking really hip. Yes. This is a new look for eva. You're welcome. Spiced pear is the flavor that I received. So this is a spiced pear quick bread with poached pears That I poached in port With a spiced fondant glaze on the top. I think it reads wreath, you know? Definitely like this is a wreath made of baked goods, But I think it says wreath. Mmm! Mmm! Oh. I know. - Oh-ho! - Oh-ho! I think I want to take you home. Ooh, wow! Whoo-hoo! It is absolutely divine. Thank you. I want a little more spice in the cake, But the pear carries so much flavor. I would say, because the cake is so tender, I would have thinned out that fondant a little bit. Okay. But this is... I'm excited about you. Well, thank you. Hope I don't disappoint. Eva, thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you. Hi, my name is aubrey, I'm from baltimore. Nice. Yes. Yeah, baltimore! Whoo! I got chocolate and orange. So we have a swirled chocolate batter With a blonde chocolate and orange batter That are mixed together. And then I finished off with a white chocolate glaze. Zhuzh'd it up with some orange liqueur for you, nancy, And then finished it off with some really nice Candied garnishes to kind of bring in that festive spirit. Uh, these look delicious. The drippy-ness of it, All the stuff that's on top. Unfortunately, It just looks like a circle of delicious things, Not necessarily a wreath. I love all the textures. Thank you. But I find it to be dry. I mean, it really is dry. I mean, I can actually crumble it. I got a little orange, but I-I-I... I was disappointed Because I wanted it to be really good. You and me both. Alright, aubrey, thank you. Thank you so much. - Thank you very much. - Thank you. - Hi, julianna. - Hi! So I had the apple cinnamon, I was lucky, I love apple cinnamon, so I have apple cinnamon Quick bread filled with cinnamon vanilla caramel And I have a cinnamon apple buttercream. Can't wait. I don't want to touch these roses. They're so beautiful. But I will. Are you a cake decorator? I'm a home baker. Are you really? I am. So this is home baking. You know, I tell you, Like making organic shapes with buttercream I find to be incredibly difficult. It's really impressive. -Mmm. -Mmm. -Mmm. Crunchy. It's okay? - Oh! - Wow. Well, it's one of the best bites I've had today. Okay! It was really delicious, the caramel that you did, That bitter note was really great inside. I got apple, I wanted more cinnamon. Okay, next time. I'll make sure you get some cinnamon. Nice job. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Off you go. Okay. Beat it. Bye, judges! Hey, jon. Nice to meet you guys. My flavor that I got was citrus and ginger. So what I have in front of you today is a ginger muffin Quick bread with candied ginger, dried cranberries, Candied lemon and candied orange as well, with a whiskey Ginger buttercream. You're talking my language, honey, thank you. It's kind of like a kentucky mule in my buttercream, So I'm pretty excited with how that came about. I can't wait! I like the fact that It really looks like snow. Like when I was first looking at it, I was like, This just feels like colder and like a little more wintry. Dude. You got a dude. No, I'm from tennessee, but I don't drink. But the buttercream is really... Nancy should be really happy. I got a little twirl. Whew! Ha! Whew! Perfect. You got to stay warm out in new England. I think the ginger comes through beautifully. Thank god. I'm not sure I'm getting the citrus. I agree with carla. I'm definitely getting ginger. I got no citrus. It could be because There's like a shot and a half of whiskey in there. I could stand a little more myself. Shocker. Alright, jon. Thank you, man. Thank you, judges. Appreciate it. Thank you, jon. It was a lot of bourbon. But I think if you had had the citrus to balance that, It wouldn't have been so whiskey forward. You know, it it had the citrus. Alright, so judges, out with the old-school banana bread And with these quick bread wreaths. Let's bring in megan. - Hi, megan! Hi! So I got chocolate orange, And so I made a chocolate-based quick bread With a little bit of candied oranges on the inside, Some orange zest and then an orange glaze going on the top. I really just wanted to kind of bring The holiday wreath to life. I love dimension, So trying to get a couple of layers in there, A little bit more chocolate with some chocolate pinecones, Some chocolate ornaments, And then just kind of ribbons and candy canes And things that you would typically find on a wreath. Well, I think it's the best wreath we've seen thus far. Oh, good! And I'm delighted to know that those ornaments are chocolate. What's going on inside here? A little bit of chocolate chips, candied oranges, And then some orange zest as well. I just think these are great. It's nice to sort of have This cake that's like kind of chocolate flavor. And then every once in a while, chocolate. You know what I mean? You get like a bigger Sort of chocolate flavor, And the orange is really nice. Thank you very much. If I'm having chocolate, I want some friends. Orange is a really great friend to chocolate. The thing that makes this so delicious and the crumb So moist, the candied orange peel, The chocolate chips, and that beautiful batter, And it is really fantastic. And then you get the crunches on the outside. - Thank you very much. - You're very welcome. - Thank you, megan. - Nice job, megan. - Hey, kess. - Hi. - Hi! - How are you doing? I got apple cinnamon, So you have the apple cinnamon quick bread with cream cheese Infused with cinnamon and apple butter. I think it's lovely. I think it absolutely epitomizes a wreath, Gets extremely holiday, and I can't wait to taste it. It tastes good. Does it taste good? That, I know. "that, I know!" Can't really wait now. Enjoy. Mmm! Oh. Duff, talk to me. Mmm! Everybody just "mmm!" Everybody said, "mmm!" Man, the inside is just like a cloud, you know, Got the cinnamon, I'm tasting apple, But I'm really tasting cinnamon. This is a nice little cake. Thumbs up. Thank you so much. And it is so well balanced. Your spices, your cinnamon, Your apple, everything is perfectly balanced. We don't get that a lot. So well, you just keep it up, girlfriend. You get the apple, you get the cinnamon. The cream cheese that you wanted to give us is fantastic. Well done. Alright, kess. Thank you so much. -Thank you. -Nice job. -Thank you. This is delicious. Delicious. This is delicious. Bakers, as you see, We've done a little bit of redecorating. This is the naughty or nice list. We're going to be tracking your status. The naughtiest of the bunch will be at the very bottom. Now, the naughty or nice list That's going to be hanging around all season. And it's going to remind you basically where you stand. Your quick bread wreaths really put us In the holiday spirit. eh. But only one of you will be opening the door To the advantage. And that baker is... Kess! Oh, my god! For real? Yes, kess, for real. You won the advantage, you won the preheat. Wow! So I bet you wonder what you've earned. Yes. I'll tell you about that in a minute. I did let you know earlier that you really needed To perform in this preheat Because the least successful baker Is going to be going home now. There are two bakers that struggled in this challenge. And they ended up in the bottom. Jon and... Jonathan. Jon and jonathan, will you guys please step forward? Good luck, man. Alright, guys, when I show you the naughty or nice list, If your name is in red, That means you're going to be leaving us. You guys ready? Yeah. Okay. Alright, guys, when I show you the naughty or nice list, If your name is in red, That means you're gonna be leaving us. Jonathan. Sorry, man. I'm so sorry, man. Unfortunately, your time with us was short. It was also definitely sweet. But now is the time to say goodbye. You did a good job, man. We all have bad days. And it's still been a wonderful experience. But I guess I'm really just disappointed That I wasn't able to show everybody Who I am as a baker, and what I can really do. Brr! It's really getting cold in here, bakers, Don't you think? It really of makes you realize how important a winter hat is This time of year. I mean, because if you were all wearing hats, You wouldn't be getting snow in your hair, right, kess? Yeah. Which is the inspiration for the main heat. You're gonna have 2 1/2 hours to create winter hat cakes. Now, when time starts, you're each gonna claim a hat To use as inspiration for your cake. Oh, and kess, as the winner of the pre-heat That green w next to your name, That gives you the first choice of a winter hat To inspire your cake. So, kess, come on up. Choose a hat. Kess runs right up, and picks the christmas tree hat. And that's the hat I had my eye on. Kess, why did you choose that one? 'cause I like the color and texture. I want to scream. Alright, bakers, 2 1/2 hours, winter hot cakes. And sadly, another one of you is gonna be leaving This cozy kitchen today. So, make sure it isn't you, alright? Okay. Your baking time starts... Now. I want the chicken. I got this little striped knit guy. I love the amount of detail that's in the knit, So I'm hoping that I have enough time To do that, as well, with some piping. I love everything about the holidays. And it just means family time. You like it? I am married, with two kids, and I have another one on the way. I want this bad enough that I came out here Seven months pregnant...... So I am ready to bring it home. My daughter is really into earmuffs in the wintertime. So, headgear is something that I'm familiar with. So, I am gonna do a cinnamon swirl cake With a cookie dough filling. So, it's going to end up tasting like a snickerdoodle. To make it look like a hat, I'm going to end up using five layers That I can try to carve into a dome shape. And then, I need to make my brown sugar swirl. We always have a snickerdoodle cake Around the holidays, And I think that it's definitely a winning flavor. Let's swirl these guys together. The pressure to stay on top of my game Is definitely real, with the naughty or nice list, Because it is quite obvious where you're standing. Right. Let's go to the oven. Look at megan. Going in first again, megan. Nobody cares. The hat I got was a reindeer hat. I love hats like that. My hat looks like two little antlers, and little elf ears. Get that flour out of there. Come on, baby, let's go. You're officially on the show. Oh, my gosh. Let me sit down. I am married to a wonderful man named diedrich sanford. We've been married for 23 years now, And we have three children, and I am a grandma. My baking style is that old-fashioned home-cooking Pound cake-eating bacon. Today, I'm gonna make a double chocolate cake With a chocolate whipped ganache As my filling, with chopped pretzels. And I'm going with a milk chocolate frosting, too. Because my hat is brown, So, I thought, "let's bring chocolate inside and outside." Most people use boiling water. I use coffee in mine. This is my secret potion to my cake. I feel like this is gonna make the chocolate really shine. All cakes in. - Jeffrey, how are we doing? - Doing great. How are you doing? - Doing great. I see a beautiful blue hat here. Why did you pick that one? I love the cool colors. It reminds me of the winter season. I'm making a white chocolate peppermint cake With a white chocolate buttercream. I want to convey the feeling Of why you would put that hat on. I was in alaska a few years ago, and to see the glaciers there, One of the highlights of my life. The ice is so bright white that it's actually blue. So, that's why I'm using this blue color palette. I want to have a little bit of a wow factor When we cut into the cake. So, I color one of the layers blue. Ooh, that's bright blue. So, the hat I chose was a red hat with, Like, fluffy inside. So, I'm gonna do a toasted coconut cake for the fur. And then, I'm gonna do a cranberry filling with coconut And cream cheese coconut icing. This in there. Now that my cake is in the oven, And I start moving on to the cranberry filling. I toss that in the pot with some sugar, Some lemon juice, And I just mix those until they get to a nice consistency. I've never paired coconut and cranberries before, But I feel like the tartiness of the cranberries And coconut rich flavor, I feel like it'll mesh well together. So, I had the advantage to pick the first hat. My eyes just caught the green christmas tree, With the christmas colors. So, I'm making a bourbon butter pecan coconut cake With a bourbon-infused swiss meringue buttercream. To make the shape of the hat, I'm going to bake the cake three layers, and carve it. Now, they're beautiful. The judges wanted a lot of spices, So I'm gonna put a lot. I'm gonna do a cardamom cake with some pear filling. And I'm gonna have a buttercream that's honey flavored. Coming out well. I'm excited. This is stella, 5 years old. And this is porro, just 5 months old. And we live in champaign, illinois. I moved to champaign, illinois, about two years ago, When my husband started medical school. And I knew that, coming from a big city... Seattle... there would be less activities To be participating in. So, I wanted to keep myself busy. So, I gifted myself a blast chiller. I always took this baking as a hobby. But if I really do win this, I feel like I could be... It could be more than a hobby. It could be something that I go into. So, I really hope I win. I placed exactly in the middle, So I'm not naughty or nice. I'm, like, average, really. I don't want to be average. Right in the middle. Nobody touches my cake. So, when it came to the pear filling, I start by chopping up the pears. I put it on the stove. I put my spices, Which was cinnamon, some cardamom. I, personally, love yuzu. Yuzu has more, like, a floral flavor, To go along with the spices. It'll be so good. So, I picked the hat that I thought was, Like, the most cool to look at. It's a pretty intricate hat, so I'm gonna try to go ahead And capture some of those colors. I'm gonna do a cranberry almond cake With a cranberry compote in the middle, And a simple vanilla buttercream. My hat has antlers, And it's a huge design element of the hat. So, to replicate this, I decide to make some shortbread cookie. No matter what you do, make it look like an antler. - Hey, kristina. - Hello. You got the turkey hat? I did. And I'm very excited about it. Did you want to get the turkey hat? Oh, yeah. I definitely think I have The most difficult hat to recreate, But I think mine is the most fun. So, what are we making today? Huckleberry muffins. That's right. My fondest holiday memory Is probably baking with my children. I get very busy around the holidays, just, with work. And so, I've made a deal with santa that he will put All of the special gifts into a ginormous santa bag. And he will leave it for the kids, So that they can't open any presents without me. I just found out... Mom's on the show! My daughter, one day, wants to be on The "kids baking championship," So I think she's gonna be pretty stoked That mom's got a little foot in the door for her, there. I need to get these pans prepared. My plan for this is to use cake For my turkey legs and turkey wings. Then, I'm going to use fondant to make the santa hat. Alright. Cream, baby. Cream. So, I have decided to make a vanilla cake With a black pepper cardamom pastry cream, A salted caramel and a roasted apple filling, And then, a sort of caramel swiss buttercream. To make my apple filling, I sprinkle on some pectin, throw in some cubed butter. I got this beautiful snowflake hat. And I was totally taken back to the coldest place I've ever lived, which was utah. I felt what - 20 feels like. So I was like, "I need something to warm me up." So, I thought of hot cocoa. I'm making a peppermint hot chocolate cake With layers of devil's food cake, Chocolate ganache, marshmallow fluff, Candied peppermint, and cocoa nibs. So, to make this look like a hat, I'm gonna take regular white fondant, Lay that over my buttercream cake, And then finish it with some black and silver snowflakes. Alrighty. I got the trapper hat. It reminds me of my favorite, favorite movie, "christmas vacation," where you have cousin eddie. I'm making my standard delicious, moist, Wonderful chocolate fudge cake. It's made of unsweetened chocolate, brown sugar, Sour cream. There you have it. While my cakes are baking in the oven, I am making my buttercreams. The chocolate buttercream is gonna be The filling for my cake, and also my fur. My filling is basically chocolate and butter. It's a very, very rich, almost fudgie type of frosting. Beautiful. Can I just steal a squeeze, real quick? I'll bring it back. Can I steal a squeeze? For my marscapone frosting, I'm hoping that the color combination Is gonna be enough to stay "holiday." That's the red I was looking for earlier. As I'm working away on my marzipan frosting, I realize I smell something a little off. Oh, no. And I'm like, "oh, my goodness. My cookies." Santa don't like no burn cookies. I'm definitely a lot stressed out, So, try to make it work. 90 minutes to go. Winter had cakes, So, I burned my cookies. I'm freaking out a little bit. But I've got a little bit of extra dough. So I'm gonna try to get this all assembled, Bake off a couple more, and assemble my cake, And pull it off in the end. Alright. Be blessed. Cake day, baby. Kess, miss cool calm and collected, is at the top. Makes sense. And then, you've got me at the bottom, Mr. Poor time management. Not surprised. So, we're getting ready for The "holiday baking championship," here, Prepping up our recipes. Got my best little helper right here, Mr. Stark. Hogging up my textbook, though, So, gonna have to figure that out. Oh. No, he's still out. People don't usually think I'm a baker when they see me. I'm a pretty tall guy. I'm about 6'4". I've got this big, ugly thing on my face. But don't let it fool you. I can still throw down in the kitchen. I am engaged. Back in February, I proposed to my best friend. So, I've got a wedding to plan, And $25,000 would definitely help us, As far as that goes. We've got a little bit of clove. Today, I'm gonna be making a vanilla spice cake With cinnamon whiskey simple syrup, With a cream cheese filling, and cinnamon buttercream icing. After my cakes are in the oven, and baking, I start getting going on that buttercream. Jon, what's up, man? How we doing? We doing okay? Yeah. I'm planning my next... My next move. Why did you choose this hat? 'cause that's a hat I would wear at home. I love the hand-knitted hats. My fiance's mother loves to knit, So she makes me one every year. That's awesome. So, yeah, that's my inspiration. Behind this, is my soon to be mother-in-law. Which is a very smart... Very smart... This one's for you, susan. You have a very, very smart son-in-law. So, the inspiration for my fake flavors Is peppermint hot chocolate. While my ganache is finishing up, I start my marshmallow fluff, Because you can't have hot chocolate without marshmallow. They told me my cakes were too dry, And I will not have that happen again. I'm going to soak my cake with my mint liquor syrup. I really want to bring those holiday flavors in there, So I have my chocolate ganache and chocolate cake... Like the cocoa... My marshmallow fluff to go on top, And then a little bit of peppermint accented. This is not how this works. Just let this naturally do its thing. After finishing this cranberry filling, I start working on that cream cheese frosting. I wanted to make sure that my flavor components Correlated with the colors of the actual hat itself. So, I've been baking for seven years, now. Everywhere I work, I have always been the youngest one in there. And all the 28-year-olds, the 30-year-olds, They just look at you like you don't really know anything. But in reality, I do know a lot. I'm gonna go to the freezer. The sheetcake is done, so I'm filling, stacking, Filling, stacking. And then, you close it on top. Ooh. Wow. - How does it smell for you? Oh. Oh, my gosh. I would just eat it like that. It's my favorite cake. It is? - Yeah. - Really? And I have some pear filling. I think I'm gonna cook it a little longer. So, for the buttercream, I decide to do a honey bourbon buttercream, Which goes really well with cardamom. Go, but I buttercream, go. I've got to hurry up. I have a lot of piping to do. And then, I pipe buttercream around the edges of the cake, And I fill the middle with the pear filling. I think this is enough. Behind you. I'm making a cranberry compote for my cake Because it's one of my favorite flavors of the season, And I think it is really nicely with almond. Fresh cranberries, a little bit of sugar, and orange juice. So, essentially, it's cooking those cranberries Down into a jam, So that I can make a filling for my cake. There's gonna be a nice pop tart cranberry compote there To balance out some of the sweetness of the cake. That's is as good as that's gonna get today. So, with the cranberry compote, I'm going to put that between the layers of the cake. So, in addition to the swiss buttercream, There's gonna be a nice pop of tart cranberry compote, there. Making it happen. I'm making it happen, you know? Ooh. Smell that peppermint. Trying to match the colors of the hat itself Is very challenging. It's very muted blues, and greys. I want to match them as much as possible. That's gonna do. There's a white layer on the bottom. Then, I put a layer of buttercream, The blue layer, and some white chocolate chips. I'm a huge white chocolate fan. Growing up, at easter, I always had a white chocolate bunny in my basket. Plus, it's a little burst of, you know, extra white chocolate. Most people are going into sculpted cakes. I have never sculpted a cake. I weigh my options, and decide I'm going to go with The traditional round cake, piped with a design That is going to be inspired by my hat, But not sculpted. We're good. I pull out my cakes. Then, I'm gonna make My black pepper-cardamom pastry cream. Alright, let's get this pastry cream started. Oh, you're thickening. Perfect. Good, good, good, good, good. Black pepper is one of my favorite ingredients. My style is to pull in some savory aspects into my desserts. My biggest concern for this challenge Is making sure that I can get all the flavors into the cake And still have time to decorate. Put a little bit of the caramel on all the layers, And then, I alternate where I've got the pastry come on one layer And the apple filling on the next. Oh. Lovely. Yeah, baby. That's what I'm talking about. Once everything's chilled, and it's all cooled down, I level them, and then stack them With the chocolate buttercream. You can do it. What's really challenging with the trapper hat Is going to be carving the shape. Make this look like a hatch. Oh, my goodness gracious. Eva, how are we doing, over there? We're doing good. What are we doing? What are we in the process of? We are making a trapper hat. A trapper hat. A trapper hat. Okay. It has the earflaps, you know, like elmer fudd would wear. Yeah. We wear those in canada, eva. That's where I'm from, originally. Eh? Yeah. Eh. That's right. I got some good-looking cakes Coming out of my oven. And I'm really happy about it. My cakes are done. My buttercream is done. I'm taking some advice from duff this time, And I'm hitting this with a little bit of simple sirup My cake is gonna be filled with a cream cheese buttercream, And then topped with a cinnamon buttercream on the outside. Alright, bakers, winter hot cakes. And this is to stick around. Let's make some filling. I'm going to get started on my cookie dough filling. This is not a real cookie dough. This is an icing that we have made to taste Exactly like cookie dough, with no egg moves. So soft and fluffy. Oh, yeah. Cinnamon. Okay. - Hey, megan? - Yes? Want to hear a great joke? Oh, boy. Do I. Alright. So, two hats are hanging out in the hat rack. And one looks at the other and says, "you stick around, I'm going to go on ahead." Oh. That's a good. That was a good one. My cake filling is going to be A whipped ganache. I take heavy cream, And I take my melted chocolate chips, and I whisk it together. Once I get my whipped ganache together, I end up folding some chopped pretzels, 'cause I'm thinking I want to add A little bit of salty into my sweet. And I think it's gonna be a good crunch. Oh, oh. Yeah, baby. My cakes are out of the oven. I'm feeling great. Just got to get them assembled. I put the whipped ganache pretzel filling On every layer of my cake. And on the outside, I have the milk chocolate frosting. Come on, cake hold on. My cake is still in the oven. And so, I start working on my Bourbon-infused swiss meringue buttercream. I'm against the clock. I have to get my cake baked and cooled, so I can ice it. Otherwise, I'm not gonna get anything to show the judges. After some time, I just checked the cake. I took it out. I've got to put this in the blast chiller. If the cake is not cool, the buttercream is gonna melt. Bakers, may I have your attention, please. Oh, crap. I forgot about this part. Well, we're still getting to know all of you. So, for this twist, it would be really helpful If you could embroider your name onto your winter hate cake, Like this. No. Okay. Please make sure it has an embroidered look. And also, make sure that it's clearly readable. Thanks, jesse. This cake is still hot. I took it out of the blast chiller, And it was still hot. I've got to do this. So, I just put it on the cake board. Oh, gosh, this is melting. I put the second cake on top. It's moving 'cause the bottom filling is melting. Now, I have very little time left, And I have to start carving and put into buttercream on. I'm a little freaked out right now. This is not good. 30 minutes left, bakers. Winter hat cakes. I've got to say it... Hats off to you bakers. Oh! I get it. Ha ha. Someone's got jokes. How are you feeling, kess? How's you cake going? No good. What's going on over there? It's just melting. Getting a little big. I've never really sculpted a cake That was kind of in a dome form. But I feel like I would be able to just trim a little bit off The top, just to give it that round dome that it needs. So, right now, I'm trying to make the pompoms for my cake, And I just made it out of extra leftover cake Mixed with some icing, to make, like, a cake ball. And now, I'm rolling it in toasted coconuts, To give it that color. And I want to pipe that little knitted texture on the hat. And I want to make sure that those little flaps Are just flapping away on the end of the board. Okay. I just have extra icing. So I'll just use this For this twist, I have extra icing, So I'm just gonna pipe my name on this cake. Boom. So, in order to create the sort of knitted, Quilted look into this hat, I'm just gonna be hand-piping in small, intricate lines, That sort of quilted pattern going throughout the whole cake. In order to embroider my hat, I'm just gonna simply pipe j-o-n Right on the front in buttercream. Jon, what the heck? What's up? I said "what the heck?" That looks amazing. It's what I do, man. My dome is too hot, so I'm not even gonna work with it. I'm gonna go with what I have. My plan to make my cake look like a hat Is to use buttercream, and make it look like a sweater texture. Lashonda, how are we doing? We're making it. We are hurriedly piping, I see. Yep. You gonna make it on time? I think so. On a scale of 1 to 10, how stressed would you say you are? 200. 200. To make the chocolate for my antlers, All I do is melt chocolate, And I just pipe it in a bag. Fridge. I also roll out some gum paste for my little ears, Because it's the one thing that I think is gonna hold up, And not melt, and not fall apart. I don't want to do this anymore. I don't want to do this anymore. To incorporate my name, I run and get the fondant. I roll it out. And I take a marker that's edible, And I write my name, shonda, on the plaque. I'm thinking, "it's simple." But I'm thinking "I've met the challenge." Oh, don't break on me. Come on. Oh, you little pooper. Don't do that. Don't do that. To decorate my cake, I'm going to put green fondant on first, And start brushing some luster dust on my green fondant, And pray that it looks like plaid. The worst thing that anybody can ever say when you do a cake Is "what's that supposed to be?" Then, I will take chocolate buttercream, And attempt to make fur. You know, I've seen better looking for in my day. Alright, little guy, red at the time. My plan to decorate this Is to individually pipe with buttercream, In order to get that stitching detail. So, every single inch of this cake is hand-piped. Let's figure out how to embroider a name. My plan here is to, hopefully, Make it kind of look like the knit hats That have some leather patchwork on there. So, I'm going to cut out fondant letters. And then, I'm going to go back, and add some stitching details, So that it looks like somebody's actually stitched Some leather letters onto the hand. Yes. How am I gonna do this? I have to get these legs and wings on. So, we're going cake-pop style With this buttercream and this cake, To make the legs... the little kickers... and the wings. I've got my gloved hands. I grab some buttercream, and I grab the cake, And I start rolling into the shape I want, And I adhere it to the cake. Kristina, you've got 6 minutes and 48 seconds To make that turkey hat cake. Just gobble, gobble. Pray for me. I think it looks like that hat. That's just me, though. I don't think we have the warm and fuzzies right now. It's kind of like a christmas tree, right? That's cool. Do not forget the "embroider your name" twist. How is my name going on this thing? Oh, yeah. Okay. I look like grinch on this cake... no joke. Julianna isn't a grinch. I'm gonna pass out. Well, at least I got "kess" there. I need a christmas miracle. That is a crazy topper. But okay. It looks like a hat, at least. You've got 90 seconds left. Pipe like the wind, jeffrey. I'm trying. No time to do the tassels. This might be my swan song, here. Ah! What are you dancing to, lashonda? I'm waiting on my chocolate. What music's playing in your mind? Jingle bells. You better pull that cake out soon, lashonda. We got 20 seconds left. Go, lashonda! Be quiet, jeff. 10 seconds, bakers. 3... 2... 1. Time is up. Alright. Alright, so, judges, our bakers had 2 1/2 hours To make winter hat cakes. And they had to embroider their name on it. Alright, judges, we're gonna bring in lorenzo. Oh, boy. Guess who? Had to be a little extra. Great match. Thank you. Lorenzo, tell us about your cake. So, it's a toasted coconut cake and a cranberry filling With a toasted coconut cream cheese icing. And then. I piped my name on there, On the side, as best as I could. I mean, I think the name doesn't look like it was Knitted on there. But, you know, everything else is so fabulous. Here's to you, lorenzo. I'm not tasting enough coconut, lorenzo. Really? Wow. But the good news... It's amazing! Thank you. Thank you, nancy. I love coconut. Its' an earthy flavor. It's sweet, not very acidic. And the cranberries are really brightening it up, And making it delicious. Alright, lorenzo, thanks again. Awesome. Thank you. Bye. Guys. - Bye. - Okay, let's bring in kess. - Alright. What's up with that? I don't want to get closer to it. Of course, you won the advantage. You had the first choice of the hat. You chose this one. So, it is that bourbon, butter pecan coconut cake With bourbon-infused swiss meringue buttercream. Ooh. I know. It is amazing, for sure. You know, kess, from far away, It's actually pretty spot on. It's a tenner cake. You just need to be 10 or more feet away. Let's just eat it. Yeah. Look at the inside. Whoa. Hello. Oh. This is the best cake I've ever eaten. The cake is so soft that that coconut Is just kind of floating around in there, On this cloud of butter pecan deliciousness. It is delicious. Alright, kess, this is why they say "do not judge a book by its cover." That cake tastes delicious. Thank you so much. - I want to eat the whole thing. - I know. Me, too. Hey, julianna. Tell us about your hat. I have a cardamom cake inside Filled with spiced pear. Instead of lemon, I decided to go a little bit Floral flavor with it, So I put a little bit of yuzu in it. And it has honey bourbon, and my name, julie, on it. It's short for "julianna." I think you have captured the winter home. I love your pompoms. I think they're great. But I wanted it to look knitted, And it doesn't. It just... I don't know. It feels to me like you decorated the cake, And then, you just sort of put your name on. I happen to love cardamom, And it goes so well with the spiced pears. And the ganache with the buttercream. What? So good. And not too sweet. Alright, julianna. Thank you. Thank you. Bye. It was delicious inside, and not cute on the outside. But she... she did replicate the hat. Kind of. Judges, winter hat cakes with embroidered names. Hey, jeff. - The santa from atlanta. Santa from atlanta. Alright, jeff, tell us about your hat. I made a white chocolate peppermint cake. Ooh. An then, a white chocolate buttercream. And then, there's some white chocolate chips In between the layers, as well. I like your name, because it does look Like the knitting on the cap. If you had put your batter in a bowl, then turned it out, Then, you would have more like the shape of a hat. I've never done that before. And today, I just didn't think was the day to... - Try it? - Exactly. Oh, man. What does that taste like? Like a winning cake. Like the tin of christmas bark that you usually get. This is really good. It's really... it's peppermint-y Without, like, burning my nose out. Your cake is really moist. I dig it. Thank you. If somebody came to your house, and you gave them this cake, They're coming back. And they feel loved. - Thank you. - Truly. Alright. Thank you, jeff. Thank you. Hey. Megan. Tell us about your hat. It's a snickerdoodle cake. So, it's a cinnamon brown sugar swirled white cake, And then, it's a layer of cookie dough filling. And then, on the outside, We have just a vanilla american buttercream. My embroidered name, I took some fondant. And I went back, and I added, like, Some little stitching details. It looks like a knit cap... I hat that jesse would wear if it had a big pompom. Even with you name on it, megan, I would wear it. Oh. Oh. Wow. Oh. It just... you know what I need to give you? A snickerdude! My entire mouth is engaged, and it's so great. You've really given us, like, that essence of snickerdoodle. It's that warm cinnamon. It's real buttery. This is great. - Thank you. Alright, megan, look, if I were you, I'd get out of here right now. Thank you very much. I've come back. Hey, aubrey. So, tell us about your hat. We have a peppermint hot chocolate theme going on. I made a layered devil's food cake with chocolate ganache, Marshmallow fluff, cocoa nibs, and peppermint. I like the presentation. I get the hat. I get the slouch, a little bit. Your name looks great. The blue is bleeding a little bit. But your name reads so well from afar. Usually, when a cake falls apart like this, It usually means it's gonna be really good. Or really dry. It is not dry. Fuller and the crunch of the peppermint... Right on. You got peppermint? I did. It's in the bottom layer. I didn't get any peppermint. I wanted more peppermint. You know, I got really excited about hot chocolate And peppermint, you know? So, yeah, I think... And I think, yeah, More of the crunch. More, like, little peppermint pieces. Alright. Alright, aubrey. Great job. Thank you. Well, hopefully till next time. Thank you. Alright, jamaal. Talk to us about your hat. Yeah, so, today, I made for you guys A cranberry almond cake with a vanilla swiss buttercream And a meyer lemon butter cookie antler on top. And I think I'm on the beach. But then, I realized I was at The "holiday baking championship." And I didn't see any correlation to the hat, And the cake, and the challenge. Your fine piping of your name is pretty fine. It looks so tender. This crumb looks beautiful. The cake itself is delicious. It's tender. It's got a nice almond flavor. The texture of your cookie, the sandiness, is really great. Thank you. Alright, jamaal. Thank you. Thank you, guys. - Thanks, jamaal. - Thank you. Your mouth is bright blue now. Your tongue is bright. Eva. Welcome back. Hi, everybody. That headband is working. It's working for me? Oh, good. I got the trapper hat. I did a sour cream fudge cake on the inside With a chocolate butter frosting. And then, I did just some chocolate buttercream. Tried to make the fur. Tell us about your embroidery. So, I just did it in white. I only have three letters, which was really easy. I love the buttons. I love all of the little details on the back. It was really well thought out. And the plaid looks great. - Thank you. - Sour cream fudge cake. So rich. Really chocolaty. Really moist. I feel like you can dial down the sugar. A little sweet. I think it's a little on the sweet side. Well, I love chocolate. And the sour cream, I think, Takes away from the sweetness. So, it really wasn't... Too sweet. Alright. Thank you, eva. Thank you, eva. - Bye. Alright, kristina, tell us about your hat. I made a vanilla cake with a black pepper And cardamom pastry cream, And a salted caramel and a roasted apple filling. And then, I made a salted caramel swiss buttercream. I decided to turn the lights into my name. So, now, my name is in lights. Ta-da. If I was in this competition, and I saw that hat, That's the one I would have picked. It's probably the hardest one to do. You've got a turkey hat. Your cake looks like a raw chicken. I would like to see it baked. Okay. But I love that your name is in the lights. I can't really read it. What does it say? So, my name is kristina, But a lot of times, my friends call me "k-tina." It's funny, how, like, in get all these cakes Where people had to do their names, All of a sudden, everybody's got really short nicknames. Have you noticed that? Really bright, crisp apples. Your cake is almost... Almost underbaked. Almost. It's a little floury, a little bland. The filling was nicely spiced. But I think duff is right. I think it's slightly underbaked. Alright, k-tina, thank you. - Thank you. - Thank you. Thank you. Yeah, it definitely looks like a raw chicken. Judges, charming winter hat cakes to keep out the chill. Hi, lashonda. Tell us about your cake. I call it "the best chocolate cake you ever ate." Has a little whipped ganache in the center, With chopped pretzels, With the milk chocolate frosting on the outside. So, if you look at my hat, there's little antlers and ears. And so, I was trying to do both. The reindeer hat and your cake are very similar. Thank you, nancy. Well, except your antlers melted, And your ears aren't big enough. I kind of thought those were eyes. Sorry. I put my name on there as best I could, With a little patch of fondant and a little handwritten sign That says "shonda." It looks like it's, like, some gaff tape. You just wrote your name with a marker, and stuck it on. I could do that. Ooh, look at the inside. That whipped chocolate ganache, It's really chocolaty, but it's clean. And there's a nice salt in there, too. I was looking forward to the pretzel, Because I wanted that crunch. I think, what happened here, all your pretzels dissolved. But they left their salt behind. I taste the coffee. And the coffee is great with chocolate, Because it intensifies the cocoa. Alright. Lashonda, thank you. Thank you guys. - Thank you. - Thank you. Big jon. Alright, man. And tell us about your hat. Today, for you, I have a vanilla spice cake With a cinnamon whiskey simple syrup. The filling, I want with a cream cheese buttercream. And then, the outside is frosted in a cinnamon buttercream. It looks like a hat. That's what we're going for. The hat you chose is, like, really kind of fuzzy and warm. And, like, your cake is kind of fuzzy and warm, too. Like, I feel like you really captured that sort of, like, Just the coziness. You know, I love that you're not shy with the cinnamon. You know, you promised us cinnamon, and it's in there. I like a lot. The other thing I love... I love cream cheese. Is there nutmeg in here? A little bit of nutmeg in the batter. Yeah. I think, maybe, get rid of the nutmeg. 86 nutmeg. In the preheat, you were in the bottom. Yeah. And this is a really nice comeback. - Appreciate it. - Okay. Okay. - Okay. Great comeback, jon. Thanks, man. Thank you so much, judges. Appreciate it. - Thanks, jon. - Thank you. Man, we have good bakers. Good bakers. Bakers, hats off to you. You made a really strong showing with your winter hat cakes. And two cakes topped the rest. Lorenzo. Congrats, boy. Your cake looked exactly like your hat. Thank you. And the coconut cranberry cream cheese frosting combination... That was delicious. Megan, your cake emulated your hat successfully. And your embroidery was so well thought out. Thank you. And bakers, by the way, megan also received The first ever "snickerdude" from carla in history. However... Only one baker's cake was the most captivating today. And that baker is... ...Megan. Congratulations, You and lorenzo. You're both gonna be back next week. Awesome. There were a few other bakers that did well enough To keep their spot warm for next week. Jon. Aubrey. Seriously? Eva. Kess. Julianna. Jeff. And jamaal. Of course, that leaves lashonda and kristina. Please step forward. Lashonda, your reindeer hat cake Had broken antlers and a funky nametag That didn't remotely look like embroidery. And the pretzels inside, they disintegrated. Kristina, the judges really struggled to read your name On your turkey hat cake, which resembled a raw chicken. And the undercooked theme, that continued on the inside, Which was underbaked. Second elimination of the day. This one is twice as hard to see somebody go. But unfortunately, that's how this thing works. Kristina, I am so sorry, Please say your goodbyes, and exit the kitchen. Thank you. Bye, guys. Good luck. Awesome job, kristina. I'm disappointed to go home within the first week. But I did have a good time. Kristina, I loved your cake. Thank you. I definitely agree that it looks like a raw chicken. But unfortunately, this bird is done. Welcome back, bakers. Next week, the bakers have to make holiday sweets With nuts and seeds. You put your foot in this. I know what that means. Give this wheel a spin. Now, you're holiday-ing up dessert. Bring holiday spice, dried fruit, or holiday spirit. This might be my last bake.
