The Diary of Jonathan Harker. Third of May 1885. At last, my long journey is drawing to its close. What the eventual end will be, I cannot foresee. But whatever may happen, I can rest secure that I will have done all in my power to achieve success. The last lap of my journey from the village of Klausenburg proved to be more difficult than I had anticipated due to the reluctance on the part of the coach driver to take me all the way. However, as there was no other transport available, I was forced to travel the last few kilometers on foot before arriving at Castle Dracula. The castle appeared innocuous enough in the warm afternoon sun, and all seemed normal but for one thing. There were no birds singing. As I crossed the wooden bridge and entered the gateway, it suddenly seemed to become much colder due, no doubt, to the icy waters of the mountain torrent I had just crossed. However, I deemed myself lucky to have secured this post and did not intend to falter in my purpose.” I'm sorry. I didn't hear you come in. My name is Jonathan Harker. I'm the new librarian. You will help me, won't you? Say you will, please! -How can I help you? -Get me away from here. -But why? -He is keeping me prisoner. Who is? Count Dracula? I'm afraid I don't understand. Oh, please. Please help me to escape! Mr. Harker, I am glad that you have arrived safely. Count Dracula? I am Dracula. And I welcome you to my house. I must apologise for not being here to greet you personally but I trust you've found everything you needed. Thank you, sir. It was most thoughtful. It was the least I could do after such a journey. Yes, it is a long journey. And tiring for you, no doubt. Permit me to show you to your room. Thank you, sir. No, please, allow me. Unfortunately, my housekeeper is away at the moment. -A family bereavement. You understand? -Yes, of course. However, I think you will find that everything has been prepared for your comfort. How soon may I start work, sir? As soon as you wish. There are a large number of volumes to be indexed. Is there anything else you require, Mr. Harker? No, I don't think so. You've been very kind. On the contrary, it is entirely my privilege. I consider myself fortunate to have found such a distinguished scholar to act as my librarian. I like quiet and seclusion. This house, I think, offers that. Then we are both satisfied. An admirable arrangement. Oh, there is just one more thing, Mr. Harker. I have to go out and I will not be back until after sundown tomorrow. Until then, please look upon this house as your own. -Good night, Mr. Harker. -Good night, sir. As I shall be away for so long, I think it's better that you should have the key of the library, Mr. Harker. Thank you. You will find the library to the left of the hall. -May 1? -Yes, certainly. - Your wife? - No, my fiancée. You are a very fortunate man, Mr. Harker. May I ask her name? Lucy. Lucy Holmwood. -Charming, charming. -You are very Kind. Good night. Sleep well, Mr. Harker. At last I have met Count Dracula. He accepts me as a man who has agreed to work among his books, as I intended. It only remains for me now to await the daylight hours when, with God's help, I will forever end this man's reign of terror. -Mr. Harker, you will help me? -If it's at all possible. But tell me why is Count Dracula keeping you prisoner? - I cannot tell you that. -But if I am to help you, I must know. I'm sorry, it's not possible. You make it very difficult for me. After all, I am a guest here. If I'm to help you I must have a reason. A reason. You ask for a reason! Is it not reason enough that he keeps me locked up in this house, holds me against my will? You can have no idea what an evil man he is! Or what terrible things he does! I could not, dare not try to leave on my own. He would find me again, I know. But with you to help me, I would have a chance. You must help me! You must! You're my only hope! You must! I'll help you, I promise. Oh! Please don't distress yourself. Thank you. Thank you. I have become a victim of Dracula and the woman in his power. It may be that I am doomed to be one of them. If that is so, I can only pray that whoever finds my body will possess the knowledge to do what is necessary to release my soul. I have lost a day. Soon it will be dark. While my senses are still my own, I must do what I set out to do. I must find the resting place of Dracula and, there, end his existence forever. Soon it will be sundown and they will walk again. I do not have much time. -Good day, sir. -Good day. -May I have a brandy, please? -Certainly, sir. - Travelling far? - Not much farther, I hope. -Is it possible to have a meal? -Yes, Sir. Inga! Only a simple one, I'm afraid, sir. -Your change, sir. -Thank you. We don't get many travellers in these parts. Not that stop, anyway. You had one a few days ago, I believe. A Mr. Harker. -Harker, sir? -Yes. He's a friend of mine. -He wrote to me from this address. -Not here, sir. I remember the gentleman. He gave me a letter to post. Hold your tongue, girl! Was this the letter? -I'm not sure. -Perhaps you remember the name. Dr. Van Helsing. I'm not sure. Go and prepare a meal for this gentleman. At once. Do you hear me? What are you afraid of? I don't understand you. -Why all these garlic flowers? And over the window? And up here? They're not for decoration, are they? - I don't know what you're talking about. - I think you do. And I think you know something about my friend. He came here with a purpose, to help you. We haven't asked for any help. You need it all the same. Look, sir, you're a stranger here in Klausenburg. Some things are best left alone, such as interfering in things which are beyond our powers. Please don't misunderstand me. This is more than a superstition. I know. The danger is very real. If the investigation that Mr. Harker and I are engaged upon is successful not only you, but the whole world will benefit. Castle Dracula is somewhere here in Klausenburg. Will you tell me how I get there? You ordered a meal, sir. As an innkeeper, it is my duty to serve you. When you have eaten, I ask you to go and leave us in peace. Your meal will be ready in a minute, sir, if you'd like to take a seat. Thank you. This was found at the crossroads near that place. He told me to burn it. But your friend was such a nice gentleman, I couldn't. Harker? Harker! Harker! Harker! I'm sorry, Mr. Holmwood, but I really can not tell you anything more about how he died. Can not or will not? Whichever you wish. Dr. Van Helsing, I am not at all satisfied. You suddenly appear and tell us that Jonathan Harker is dead. Yet you will not tell us where or how he died. - I find it extremely suspicious. -Arthur! -You have the death certificate. -Yes. Signed by you. When did he die, Doctor? -10 days ago, Mrs. Holmwood. -10 days ago! -Where was he buried? -He was cremated. -By whose authority? -His own. As his friend and colleague, he told me some time ago that he would wish it. You must know that Jonathan was going to marry my sister Lucy. Surely you could have written. I felt it would have been less of a shock if I came and told her personally. I would rather you didn't see my sister. My wife and I will tell her. Very well. I'm sorry. Will you please express my sympathy to Miss Lucy? If she wishes to get in touch with me, I am at her service. Oh, Gerda, Dr. Van Helsing is leaving. Will you show him to the door? Yes, sir. Good day. Sir. Why all this secrecy? Why wouldn't he tell us? Darling, Dr. Van Helsing is a very eminent man. Whatever his motives, you can be sure he had a good reason for them. In any case, we can't help poor Jonathan now. Lucy is the one we must think of. Is she well enough to be told? It will be a terrible blow for her. -She must know sometime. We won't disturb her afternoon rest. We'll see how she is this evening. Jonathan will be home soon, I know it. Then I'll get better, you'll see. I won't be a trouble to Dr. Seward or any of you. Lucy, you're no trouble to anyone. Now rest, get some sleep. You've got to get some colour back into those cheeks. -Good night, Lucy. -Good night, Mina. Good night, Arthur. - Sleep well. - I'll try. Research on vampires. Certain basic facts established. One, light. The vampire allergic to light. Never ventures forth in the daytime. Sunlight, fatal. Repeat, fatal. Would destroy them. Two, garlic. Vampires repelled by odour of garlic. Memo. Check final arrangements with Harker before he leaves for Klausenburg. Three, the crucifix. Symbolising the power of good over evil. The power of the crucifix in these cases... Come in. -You rang, sir? -Oh, yes. I want this letter delivered first thing in the morning. -Will you see to that? -Yes. -Thank you. -Thank you, sir. Anything the matter? What is it? To tell you the truth, when I was outside, I thought I heard you talking to someone. Of course you did. I was talking to myself. You won't forget that letter, will you? No, sir. Yes. The power of the crucifix in these cases is two-fold. It protects the normal human being, but reveals the vampire or victim of this vile contagion when in advanced stages. Established that victims consciously detest being dominated by vampirism but are unable to relinquish the practice, similar to addiction to drugs. Ultimately, death results from loss of blood. But, unlike normal death, no peace manifests itself for they enter into the fearful state of the undead. Since the death of Jonathan Harker, Count Dracula, the propagator of this unspeakable evil, has disappeared. He must be found and destroyed. -She seems so much weaker, Doctor. -It's a puzzling case, Mrs. Holmwood. The symptoms are those of anaemia and I'm treating her for this. It can be a slow process, of course. I had hoped for more encouraging signs by now. - Please may I see Auntie Lucy? -Not today, Tania. -Is she very ill? -I'm afraid so. -Do you know what's wrong with her? -Of course I do. Then why don't you make her better? Tania. Tania! How many times have I told you not to go bothering Mrs. Holmwood? -I'm sorry, ma'am. -That's all right, Gerda. -A child's logic can be most disconcerting. -Yes. Would you like a second opinion, Mrs. Holmwood? Thank you, Doctor. I'll think about it. Well, carry on with the medicine and diet I've prescribed -and plenty of fresh air. -Yes, Doctor, I will. - Good day to you. - Good day. Come in. Mrs. Holmwood, how very good of you to come. -Please, will you sit down? -Thank you. You mentioned in your letter some things of Jonathan's. Yes, I have them ready. I would have brought them myself, but... Oh, I do understand. But you must appreciate Mr. Holmwood was very upset. Of course. I only wish I could have been more helpful. How did Miss Lucy take the news? We haven't told her yet. Oh, she's ill, very ill. I'm sorry to hear that. May I ask what's the matter with her? It was all so sudden. It happened about 10 days ago. Our family doctor says it's anaemia. But I'm very unhappy about it. Oh, I have nothing against Dr Seward, please don't think that, but... -He did say I could have a second opinion. -I'd like to see her at once. -Oh! I'd be so grateful. -If you'll excuse me. Lucy, I've brought someone to see you. Dr Van Helsing. He's a friend of Jonathan's. Miss Lucy. What lovely flowers. Jonathan's dead, isn't he? -It's true, isn't it? -I'm sorry. - Did Arthur tell you? - Nobody told me. I just knew. -Is that why Dr Helsing is here? -Partly. Dr Helsing is a specialist. He's come to help you. Jonathan has told me so many things about you. -Well, nice things, I hope. -Very nice. Now, let's see. Mmm-hmm. And here. Now don't you worry, we'll soon have you well again. Goodbye, Doctor. I'm sorry you had a wasted journey, about Jonathan, I mean. It wasn't wasted, I promise you. Good day, Miss Lucy. How could she have known of Jonathan's death? -A premonition. It's not uncommon. -But she took it so calmly, it worries me. I'm afraid there are more urgent things to worry about. Those marks on her neck, when did they first appear? I noticed them first shortly after she became ill. I asked her about them. She said she thought she had been stung. Well, it is quite possible, of course. Dr Seward said she must have plenty of fresh air. Her windows are open all the time. Between the hours of sunset and sunrise, all the windows in her room, with the possible exception of a small fanlight for ventilation, must be kept shut. -Oh, but Dr Seward said... -Mrs. Holmwood, you called me in for a second opinion. If I am to help your sister-in-law, there are certain things you must do to help me, however unorthodox they may appear. -Yes, I know, but... -Madam... If you love Miss Lucy, be guided by me, I beg you. I'll do anything to make her well again. Now, you must get some garlic flowers, as many as you can. Place them by her windows, and her door and by her bedside. They may be taken out during the day, but under no circumstances, even if the patient implores you, must they be removed at night. I cannot impress upon you strongly enough how important it is that you obey my instructions. Do exactly as I say and we may be able to save her. If you don't, she will die. I'll be here in the morning. Heavens, child! What is it? Oh, Gerda. These flowers, I can't stand them! They do smell strongly, but Mrs Holmwood said... I don't care what she said! Please, take them away! Please! Well... Oh, please, Gerda, they stifle me. All right, miss, I'll take them out. And the windows, you'll open the windows? Yes, Miss Lucy, if that's what you want. I'll come back for the rest. There was nothing I could do to save her. Doctor Van... Mrs Holmwood, did you do as I told you? She did. And you have seen the result. -But, Arthur... -Please, sir. Excuse me, sir. It was all my fault. She could not breathe. She looked so ill. She begged me to open the windows and throw away all the plants. Oh, I know you told me not to, ma'am, but... Gerda, what time was this? It was about midnight. - 1 heard a noise... - All right, Gerda. -You may go now. -Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. Oh, I am so sorry, sir. Whatever happened, all I know is that you have brought us nothing but grief. First Jonathan, and now Lucy. Whoever you are and whatever your motives, please go and leave us in peace. Mr Holmwood, when I told you about Jonathan, I thought it better for your peace of mind to spare the details of the dreadful circumstances in which he died. But the tragic death of your sister is so closely linked with Jonathan's that I think you should now know the truth. I can't expect you to believe me, but you will, I know, believe Jonathan. Here are his last words. His diary. When you have read it, you will understand. Well, what is it, Gerda? It's a policeman, sir. He's got Tania with him. Tania? -Show him in, Gerda. -Very good, sir. -Good evening, ma'am. Good evening, sir. -What is it, officer? I found this little girl, here. She was very distressed indeed. -Tell them what you told me. -I don't want to. Oh... Tania! There's no need to be frightened. Now, come on over here, sit with me, and tell me all about it. Oh. Now, you don't want Mr Holmwood to think you're a crybaby, do you? You're a big girl now. Now, come on. Tell me what happened. Well, I was out by myself, and she came up to me. And she said, Hello, Tania, shall we go for a little walk? And I said yes. And we went for a walk. Then someone came along, and she ran away and left me and I was lost. Who was she? Who did you see? Come on. Tell me. Who was she? Aunt Lucy. I heard you call me, Aunt Lucy. -Yes, dear. Come along. You're cold. Where are we going? For a little walk. I know somewhere nice and quiet where we can play. Is it much further, Aunt Lucy? I'm so tired. We're nearly there, my darling. Lucy! Arthur, dear brother! Lucy! Dear Arthur, why didn't you come sooner? Come, let me kiss you. Put this on. -Please, I want to go home. -And so you shall. I'll just go and fetch Mr Holmwood and then we can all go home together. -Not Aunt Lucy. -No, not Aunt Lucy. Now you sit here. Be a good girl. There. You look like a teddy bear now. Will you wear this pretty thing? There. Isn't that lovely? -Now, you promise not to run away? -I promise. Good. Now, look, if you watch over there, you'll see the sun come up. Keep warm. You understand now? -But why Lucy? -Because of Jonathan. You read my note in his diary about the woman he found at Klausenburg. This is Dracula's revenge. -Lucy is to replace that woman. -Oh, no! I've watched her tomb each night since she was interred three days ago. Tonight she ventured out for the first time. Holmwood, I know your one wish is that Lucy should rest in peace. I promise to fulfil that wish. But, first, if I have your consent, she can lead us to Dracula. How can you suggest such a thing? That she should be possessed by this evil for another second? And what about Gerda's child out there, and the others she will defile? Oh, no, I couldn't! I couldn't! Of course. Will you take that child home and then meet me back here in about an hour's time? It's all right. It's nearly dawn, she won't leave the coffin again. Is there no other way? But it's horrible! Please try and understand. This is not Lucy, the sister you loved. It's only a shell. Possessed and corrupted by the evil of Dracula! To liberate her soul and give it eternal peace, we must destroy that shell for all time! Believe me, there is no other way. -Drink this. -Oh, I'm all right now. -Drink it. -Thanks. There's so much in Jonathan's diary I don't understand. Can Dracula really be as old as it says here? We believe it's possible. Vampires are known to have gone on from century to century. Records show that Count Dracula could be 500 or 600 years old. Another thing. I always understood that, if there were such things, they could change themselves into bats or wolves. That's a common fallacy. Holmwood, the study of these creatures has been my life's work. I've carried out research with some of the greatest authorities in Europe. And yet, we've only just scratched the surface. You see, a great deal is known about the vampire bat. But details of these re-animated bodies of the dead, the undead, as we call them, are so obscure, that many biologists will not believe they exist. Of course, you are shocked and bewildered. How can you expect to understand in so short a time? But you've read and experienced enough to know that this unholy cult must be wiped out. I hope perhaps that you will help me. -I'll do anything you say. Thank you. Of course, we do know certain things. You witnessed one a little while ago. And we also know that during the day the vampire must rest in his native soil. Now. When I went to Castle Dracula, a hearse came tearing through the gates. In that hearse was a coffin. I believe it contained Dracula and a bed of his own earth. To get here, that hearse would have to come via the frontier at Ingstadt. They'll have a record there of where it was going. We need that address. Will you come with me to Ingstadt? How long will it take? I must let Mina know. With any luck, we should be back by tomorrow morning. I'm afraid that is quite out of the question, sir. Against regulations. All we want to know is where the coffin was going. I can't give away information without proper authority. This is a matter of great urgency! I am a doctor. I'm sorry, sir. There's a young lad with a message for you. Personal, he said. He wouldn't give it to me. All right, Gerda, I'll see him. -Yes? -You Mrs Holmwood? -lam. -Got a message for you. You're to go to 49 Frederickstrasse right away, he says. And you're not to tell anyone. Who says? Arthur Holmwood, he calls himself. Said you'd know him. But that's impossible. My husband has gone to Ingstadt. Not if he gave me this message, he hasn't. And he gave me this message. Good night. You've got to have permission from the Ministry in writing. I have my orders and I must obey them. It is laid down in the government regulations that under no circumstances... Under no circumstances may an unauthorised person be permitted to examine. Of course, in the case of an emergency, we do sometimes make an exception. And seeing this gentleman is a doctor... -When did you say it was, sir? -December 1. December 1. Klausenburg to Karlstadt. Let me see. Here it is. One hearse, one coffin. J. Marx, 49 Frederickstrasse, Karlstadt. Arthur? Arthur? Are you sure I can't get you anything to eat, sir? No, thank you, Gerda. We haven't time. But I would like a word with Mrs Holmwood before we go. -Will you go up and see if she's awake yet? -Yes, Sir. Are you ready? -She's not there, sir. -Not there? No, sir. Good morning. Mina, you gave me quite a fright. Where have you been at this hour of the morning? It was such a lovely day, I got up early and went for a walk in the garden. I didn't expect you back so soon. -I'm afraid I've to go out again. -Oh. When will you be back? I can't say for sure. Mina, you look pale. Are you all right? Arthur, darling, don't fuss. I feel perfectly well. Goodbye, darling. Perhaps you'd better let me lead the way, I know these steps, they can be dangerous. We don't want to have an accident, do we? No, we don't. You know, an old man came here once to see his dear departed and he fell down these stairs. It was quite amusing. He came to pay his last respects and he remained to share them. Oh, quite amusing. Where are we? Where are we? Where are we? It's around the back, somewhere. It's been here so long it's bound to be at the back, isn't it? Come on, this way, gentlemen. You follow me. I know where it was. This way. There's an extraordinary thing! It was there. I know it was, because I saw it only yesterday. I really don't understand who could have moved it. The driver of the hearse might've lied to the Frontier Official about where he was going. Yes, but that fellow at the morgue wasn't lying. He was really surprised when he saw the coffin wasn't there. He must have had it sometime. I think he's still somewhere here in Karilstadt. But where? This is a big town. There are not many places he can hide, don't forget. There is that, of course. What are you two being so mysterious about over there? We'll be with you in a moment, my darling. There is an old neglected graveyard about three miles from here. Somewhere in this area. St Joseph's. Just one moment. Mina, my dear, don't think I'm being silly, but I'd feel much happier, if during my absence, you would wear this for me. Please don't ask me why, but just wear it for my sake. -Arthur, I... -Please, Mina. You said Lucy would lead us to Dracula. Why didn't I listen to you? This would never have happened. You mustn't blame yourself for that, but you must have the courage to let Mina lead us now. We'll give her every protection we can. Tonight we'll watch the windows of her room. They face two sides of the house, don't they? Yes. I know I ask a great deal of you, but you mustn't weaken now. We have it within our power to rid the world of this evil. And, with God's help, we'll succeed. Mina's safe now, but we must keep watch again tonight. You'd better get some rest. -What about you? -I'll be all right in there, if I may. Right. -I'll get you a rug from our room. -Thank you. Mina! Just sit still like that for a minute. Thank you. -Will she be all right? I think so. Let me see your arm. Steady. Are you all right? Yes. Yes, it's very good. Now, you'll need plenty of fluid. Tea, coffee or, better still, wine. Go down and have some now, there's a good fellow. Don't worry, Gerda and I will take care of her. Just bathe her forehead, will you, Gerda? With eau de cologne or something. Yes, sir. -How is she now? -She's reacted very well. Thank God! How did he get in? We watched the house all night. Your theory must be wrong. He can change into something else. He must be able to. How else could he have got in? I wish I knew. -Madam is sleeping now, sir. -She mustn't be left. I'll go up to her. I'd like to. You stay and rest, and have some wine. I'm sure you need both. -Gerda, will you fetch another bottle? -Oh, sir, I don't like to. You know what happened last time when I disobeyed Mrs Holmwood's orders. What do you mean? Well, sir, Madam told me the other day that I must, on no account, go down to the cellar. Holmwood! Holmwood! Holmwood! Gerda, what happened? You said I was to come back to Madam, so I came up here. -And he looked like the devil! -Gerda! Now, what happened? He came in here and he picked Madam up like she was a baby! Calm yourself, Gerda. Calm yourself. There's only one place he can make for now. His home. It's a coach driver. He's been dead about half an hour. You think Dracula killed that coachman? Of course he did. Without a coach he'd never get home before sunrise. He'd be dead. -But even if he does get home... -He'd hide in the castle vaults for years. -We'd lose him there. -And Mina? Oh! Hey! Halt! It's getting light. Whoa! Look!
