Nine. Ten Eleven. Twelve. Thirteen. Who's that? What strange figures are these? Two strangers appeared from the forest. They look like ghosts. THE DAWNS HERE ARE QUIET Part Two A MINOR LOCAL FIGHT Sixteen, Comrade Sergeant. So I see. Go to Ossyanina. Tell her to get our troops into good positions. Send Brichkina over. Crawl, Comrade Interpreter. From now on we live on our bellies. Comrade Sergeant. Cheer up, Brichkina. - You remember the way to go back? - Yes. - The swamps are the worst. - Yes, I know. Wait, Lisaveta, don't hurry. The tracks are narrow, don't come off it. - I'll make it. - Take a short rest on the island. Report to Kiryanova that there's been a change of situation. Our force won't be enough to cope with it. You better leave your weapon here. Don't forget to take your marsh pole. - On your way, Lisaveta! - Shall I leave my ammunition too? You were right to fall back to here. Pretty nasty business, girls... pretty nasty. So we've counted sixteen... They'll be here in around three hours, as near as I can judge. I sent Brichkina back to the base. We can expect them come here only by the evening. If we get dragged into a fight, we won't be able to hold out. There's no position we could hold them, for they have 16 machine guns. So we just sit and watch them walk through? We've got to stop them coming along the crest and force them to go around. Around Lake Legonte. Only how? Poor Brichkina, I sent her on an empty stomach. May I observe the Germans? I haven't seen them yet. Well, go, if you came to your senses. Draw me their position. - Take care not to get noticed! - I'll be very careful! We have to continue! No, the Germans are not looking for a fight. They're taking hidden paths to keep out of the enemy's way. They're trying to sneak up on their objective without being seen. Maybe we should let them see us and pretend we haven't seen them? Then they may decide to take the Lake Legonte route, and that's a twenty four hour hike. So who can I let them see? Myself and the four of you? They'll reconnoiter and find out there's only five of us. They'll just surround us and finish off all five with their pig-stickers. Go ahead, Rita. Comrade Sergeant, what if they run into the woodcutters? What woodcutters? Where? The forests are empty, there's a war on. Women do the woodcutting nowadays. You're right, girls. That's a brainstorm! We'll put on a big act, and I know exactly the place to do it. Move it, girls, we don't have much time. Here come the others! - Wait, let me carry you. - Nonsense, I can manage. You still have that fever. They're coming, Comrade Sergeant. - The water's cold. - Lift your skirt up higher. That's not a regular order. Forget military talk for a while. The Germans have interpreters, too. You treat me like I'm a kid... Want a little more medicine? Don't sit on those cold rocks. Hurry, girls, get going! We still have some organizing to do. Where did you get this kerchief? I tore Liza's shawl in two. It was a great idea with Lisa's scarf. - A shame to tear it. - We'll get her another one. My lingerie came handy. All she thinks about is showing off. Shameless! Cover up now because you'll be with me. Well, let's begin, girls. Try to make a lot of smoke. Make a lot of noise breaking branches. Only don't stick out too much. Just keep appearing and disappearing. Only don't overdo it. - Praskovya! - What? - Take the axe! - I already did! Give me a hand! All right then! And one, and again! Here we go! The fire won't catch. It must be damp. Mine's burning fine! Once more. All together now! It won't move. Once more! More! - Watch out! - There she goes! Lop off the branches, quick! Praskovya, follow me! Masha, have you peeled the potatoes? I can hardly feel my fingers. Watch out! Hey, girls! Come and give me a hand! There she goes! They called from the center, the truck will be here. - Look, what's there? - Do we have a connection? - Possibly. Hey, girls! Be careful, will you? Take cover behind the trees, not the bushes. You can push over this one yourselves. Komelkova, follow me. Here, Galka. Anyuta, give me that axe! Go get your own axe. This one's mine and I'm using it. Girls, bring some dry wood! Hey, girls, lend a hand! Perhaps they're gone. Who can tell? Maybe they are. They know their business, or they wouldn't be on one of those missions. - Shura, help me! - Wait. Hold it! I see. Come on, push hard! Timber! It seems to be working. A patrol. They made a decision. They'll cross and our whole operation goes sky high. If they find out they've been seen, they'll need only five fingers to count us, and then it's the end. Well... I'll take care of these two. And while the rest come after me with their machine guns, you'll perhaps manage to find a hideout. You, Komelkova, go back with the others. I'll cover you. Raya! Vera! Come in the water! Halt! Come back! Apple trees and pears were in blossom On the river hung the morning mist. Young Katyusha stepped up on the high bank Of the river steep bank in the midst. Young Katyusha stepped up on the high bank Of the river steep bank in the midst. On the bank Katyusha started singing Of a proud gray eagle of the steppe, Of the one... Where're you, Vanyusha? Come on, girls, come and swim! - Coming, Zhenya! - Coming! Wait for us! What is this? Who's going to work? I'll give you a bathing! Don't worry, the work won't run away! The work can wait. Watch out! Timber! Zhenya, don't cut yourself on the rocks! I'll teach you, lazy good-for- nothings! You work first, then you go bathing! Take my position. If anything, cover me. Lop off those branches! Vanyusha, where're you? Zhenya, that water must be freezing. Why are you lolling about there? It wouldn't hurt you, either. I'm coming out. Coming for a dip, girls? I'm on my way! They phoned from the mill. The trucks are coming. So get dressed. What's the idea? Let's get out of here, Komelkova. Are you afraid of taking a swim, Vanyusha? Vanya! I can't take any more of this. I'm going to start shooting. No, Sonya, you mustn't. What are you doing? I'll fix you... Ivan lvanovich, the trucks are here. Waiting for you. Hurry! Enough of playing with fire! Get dressed. Get her warm. Easy, easy... They're leaving, Zhenya. Leaving. We sure fooled them, didn't we? Well, Eugenia, you certainly made me take a bath. - She didn't mean to. - What? She didn't mean to. Oh, I burned a hole in my skirt. Look, girls. Don't worry. We'll issue you a new one. It's over now. You sure sent them around the lake, there's no other way for them to go. Only if Brichkina manages to make it, of course. She'll make it, she's a smart kid. All right, girls, how about a little shot to celebrate it? Let's drink to Brichkina's fast legs. And to your bright heads. The worst is over now. When we get back, I'll see you all get a citation. And Zhenya a decoration. Definitely. She earned it. At present may I express my gratitude? Our lives belong to the Soviet Union! Smell that? Their German habits give them away. They feel like having coffee. What makes you think that? I feel the smoke. So they're settled down to eat. Only are all sixteen there? We'll have to count them, Margarita. If you hear any shooting, pick up the girls and head to the east as far as the canal. Make your report about the Germans there, but I guess that Lisaveta should be at our base now. - Is that quite clear? - No. What about you? Cut it out, Ossyanina. We're not on a picnic party. - Now what do you answer? - Quite clear, Comrade Sergeant! We shall sing together later, Lisaveta. When we've accomplished our mission, then we'll sing. Help! Pull me out! Zhenya, Were you really afraid? Not really, maybe only later. I'd have been really scared without you close by. You know what they say: Company in distress makes trouble less. They haven't left, they're camping. We must move our position. Thank God those Germans don't have a professional hunter with them. - Why? - I smelled you out long ago. Did you bring my tobacco pouch? Sorry, Fedot Yefgrafovich, I forgot. Never mind. I've got some rough stuff in here. Thanks for remembering my bag at least. That pouch was a present. It's a shame. - Where are you going? - I think I know where it is. Wait! Come back here! Sit down. We should've changed her boots for her, they make too much noise, because they're two sizes too large. The main thing now is not to let them find us. Organize things in your sacks so they won't make any noise. Well, anyway Lisa Brichkina should have arrived by now. As soon as the reinforcements are sent after them I'm going to get you all behind the rocks. Why? So that you wouldn't listen to foul language when the hand to hand fighting starts. - We can stand it. - Don't butt in! I want you all to take cover now and keep your eyes peeled. And no sneezing! No coughing either! Sound travels a long way here. Is that Gourvitch calling? No, it must be a bird. Komelkova, follow me. The others stay here. Follow me. The Germans? Keep quiet. Not neat... Not neat... That's why she had time to scream. He thought he was knifing a man. He didn't get the heart at the first stroke. This is all my fault. Lie here a while, dear Sonya. Cut it out, Komelkova. Get your breath back. They're right here. Close to us. There're two of them. They're going to come this way and go along the crest. Position yourself behind that rock. When they get level with this tree here, you make some noise. Not too early, nor too late. Don't start shooting or you'll draw the others. Now go on! Good work, Komelkova. I'm very obliged to you. Go away. Oh God! This is so horrible! They have broken every decent human law. And because of that, they're below any kind of decent consideration. Want to wash a little? I know. You've got to get used to it. You've got to dry up your heart. I've known men who are real strong, and even they... Until you make your mind think a different way... Think you can find the others? Go then. Bring the rest to Sonya... Say goodbye to her. Save that till later! She was an all A's student. Both at school and at university. Yes... She read poetry. What's important, she could have children. And grandchildren, too. Then the line wouldn't have been broken. And they broke it with a knife... Put them on. Why did you have to do that? Because the gunner is barefoot. And war's not a game. We have to think of the living. That's the only law in war. Put them on. That's an order. I can't. How can you? I... I shall write to my parents about it. Stop lying! You don't have parents, and never had. You're a foundling. Stop telling us tales. Don't be so mean. If we start behaving like that, we'll turn into wild animals like the Germans. Here. Fire short bursts. Otherwise it'll jam. - I know. - Only short bursts. All right now. We'll hide everything we don't need here. We'll take all the guns. Spread out! Forward! Fire! To the right! Quicker! Come here! They're pulling out. Are you hurt? No, a piece of rock, that's all. Thank you, Junior Sergeant, for that one second you gave me. For that second I should supply you with vodka all your life. - We got out of this by some miracle. - I bring luck. Luck... Lucky I saw them first. Stay back here. We treat her like a human being, and she... A Komsomol member! Every shot we fire counts here. Comrade Sergeant, are you a Party member? Then you must preside over our Komsomol meeting. And what's on the agenda? The shameful conduct in action of a card holder. Cowardice. So you want criticism? You want Comrade Chetvertak to be reprimanded, with the minutes taken? And the Germans to put their resolution on it? Right? Not right. So in my capacity as a Senior Sergeant and as a Communist, I suspend all meetings till further notice. As far as cowardice is concerned, I didn't see any. You can only see cowardice in the second battle. It was only confusion, for lack of experience. Am I right, Gunner Chetvertak? Now stop crying, and blow your nose. Ossyanina, go forward a little and watch the forest. The rest of you grab something to eat and get as much rest as you can. Have a chunk of bread, girl. - Here, eat this. - Thanks. Why do you think they broke off the contact? Any opinion? You don't know? I don't know, either. Yet we've got to understand the enemy. War doesn't mean shooting better than the others. It means thinking better. You'd better get some rest. I can't, Rita. I must look for them. I'm exhausted, but I've got to. Who you'll be taking with you? You're a good soldier, Ossyanina, only you don't know regulations. And... what do Regulations say? A commander is not just a military leader. He got to be a teacher as well. No, don't do it. You better take Zhenya. Of course, it would be better. But a person should never lose her self-respect. Follow me at a fair distance. Just take your guns and ammunition. If you hear shooting, or two duck quacks, take cover and wait for us to get back. If we don't return, you retreat, and go under cover to our previous positions eastward. - Say, how old are you? - Want the truth? Seventeen. So you told a lie when you volunteered? And I lied that the krauts killed my family. That's a good one. But I must have had parents once, haven't I? They named you at the orphanage? - Our manager thought of it. - Chetvertak. New penny. Nice name. - You really like it? - Good things come in small packages. This is horrible. They finished them off. Their own people... In the back of the head... They were finishing off the wounded. And that's the whole story, girls. They are beasts, only on two legs and with two arms. They're beasts inside. Fascists, in one word. So this is their rule, to finish off the wounded. Let's bear this in mind. Eleven left. This is a trifle for us then! Less than 3 for each of us. Let's go, in the same order. Chetvertak, follow me. Keep still! As if you weren't here! Hey! Take care! There should be someone. Oh, damn it! Where do they hide? Mummy! Don't let him out of your sight! First group, move in from the back! The rest follow me! For our Soviet Motherland! Hurray! Let's go, Rita. Let's go. There're only two of them. No, Zhenya, we must obey orders. Surround them, men! Kill the dirty fascists! Follow me! Forward! Kill the fascist swine! You do as you like. I'll go in by myself. Gunner Komelkova, we're not playing at cops and robbers. This is war! For Motherland! For Stalin! Forward! You hear that? He's trying to lead them away from us and Galka. Forward! He promised to be back by tomorrow. How about some more tea? There are six of them. They'll make it all right. How clear the nights are... Clear, but cold. We're pretty far north. I only hope the girls won't catch cold. How did it happen, Lisaveta? I was in a hurry. - Fedot Yefgrafovich! - Fedot Yefgrafovich! Comrade Sergeant! - Fedot Yefgrafovich, it's us! - We're over here! My one and only Fedot Yefgrafovich! You're alive! Oh, dear! You're here at last! There, there, girls! What is it? Did you have anything to eat? Did you manage to get some sleep? We didn't feel like it, Comrade Sergeant. You can forget about Comrade Sergeant, little sisters. I'm your brother now. Just call me Fedot, or plain Fedya, like my mother called me. I know it's a pretty ordinary name, but I got no other. We buried Galka. Our comrades died the death of heroes. Galka Chetvertak fell in action. And Lisa Brichkina has been drowned in the marsh. With Sonya, that makes three that we've lost. That's how it is. On the other hand, we've kept the Germans circling for 24 hours already. So I propose we drink to our three sisters. That we drink to their glory! Why haven't you executed my orders? What orders? I ordered you to pull back eastward. So we did. - Yes, I see... - We picked up all the equipment. Thank you for the equipment. Now listen to some more orders. You will first eat, then collect your things and march eastward. There won't be any help coming. And the Germans are coming this way. So we can't afford to waste time. And you, Fedot? It'll be my turn to try and gain 24 hours. Those three girls who'll never return, I'll remember them till my last day. Lost something, Fedya? Now I'm without a grenade. I've lost the detonator. A grenade without a detonator is just an iron rock. A snowball would be more effective. Never mind, Fedot, we'll beat them off. We'll handle them, Comrade Sergeant. You're going to pull out of here on the double! I give you 3 minutes! We are not pulling out! For that insubordination... I'll send you to Court Martial! What are you doing to me, girls? We're all very worried, too, Comrade Major. More than forty eight hours. Not a thing, no news. No, he didn't send anybody here. I said he sent no one! Yes, I think I know the route. Yes, I'll come right over. Comrade Combatants! The enemy, with plenty of firepower, is coming this way. We're uncovered on the right as well as on the left. And we have no help on the way. Therefore I order all combatants, including myself, to hold the front. Hold on. Even when you've nothing left to hold with, hold on. There's no room for Germans here! Because behind us is Russia. Or to state it simple, our motherland. It's a great life, fellahs, Soldiering's a song, When the Sergeant likes you, Nothing can go wrong. Don't start shooting until the krauts are in the water. And until then you only breathe once in a while, so the birds go on singing. Got it. Here, but for shooting over the river, use the rifle, save the machine gun. When they begin to attack, you're going to have plenty of use for it. - Got it. - Wait. Now keep an eye out. So they don't try to outflank us. - Right! - Get going! Comrade Sergeant! Hurry! It's Rita! Here she is. - What was it? - A grenade. Water... water... - Right away. - No! Some rags! Underwear! Hurry up! - No, silk's no use. We need flax. - There isn't any. Thank you, Zhenya. The Germans... Where are the Germans? Go... go! - Will you cover us? - Yeah. It's all right... It's all right, Rita. The shells didn't go in deep. You'll pull through. Go... go help her. Zhenya is all alone there. Hey, what's the big hurry? She's leading them off. She's making them follow her. Leave me. Go! Surround them! Follow me! As he was saying: Will you belong to me? So my life be Passion and fire. A smile so charming, Your eyes' fascination Promise forever A bliss of desire. Now he was happy, Now burst in tears, Now he was happy, Now burst in tears! No, he did not love... To me, poor heart, So he was saying... Bastards! Come and get me, dirty fascists! To me, poor heart, So he was saying, Though he didn't, No, he did not love... He did not! I ran out of ammunition. Love! He promised! That's interesting. Don't let her get away! Hey you! That's for Rita! And Galka! And Sonya! And Lisa! Here! This way! As he was saying: You're a bright star, Lighting forever A dark, somber soul! You have inspired... - She is there! - My heart... with a hope! Come here! Come on, come here! You're afraid? Bastards! Did she die instantly? Yes, instantly. She could have hidden, but she wouldn't. Where are the Germans? They're gone. I guess, they went for explosives. But they couldn't beat us! Do you understand? They couldn't beat us. Does it hurt? It hurts me a lot more here. I have finished you off... All five of you. And what for? A dozen lousy fritzes! You're not to blame. It's all understandable. It's war. While the war goes on, it is undersandable. And when peace comes? How am I going to explain it? What can I answer when they ask us: How come you men couldn't save our mothers from the bullets? Don't say that. We fought for our country. Don't torture yourself. You just lie here. I want to take a look around. There's only two bullets left in it. But it'll be a comfort to have it. Wait. Come closer. Remember how I found those two Germans in the forest? I was going over to the town to see my mother. She has my little boy, Igor. He's three. My mother is very sick. Don't worry, Rita. I got it. Thank you. I'll go take a look and be right back. We'll return to the base tonight. Kiss me. You need a shave... Go. Cover me with branches, and go. And be sure to make it back to the base. We'll go back together. What have you done, my dear girl? What have you done? Hande hoch! Everybody down! Everybody down! Everybody down! Alles! Alles! To the corner! Alles! To the corner! To the corner! Hande hoch! Hande hoch! Conquerors! Are you? Victors! Are you? A bunch of girls! I had just five girls with me! Five girls! And you couldn't get through! You couldn't! And you're going to die here! All of you! I'll personally kill each of you! And afterwards they can try me! Let them try me! This is Moscow. Here's a communique from the Soviet Information Bureau. During the day of June 3rd, no major engagement took place on the front. However, some minor local fights occurred in certain sectors. And another night Fell on the sleepy mountains. In the bonfire smoke The eyes of the campers glow. The wind has died down With the last song's words. Maybe it went somewhere Looking for you, though. What if all of them Happened to come here, To this great place, Where the glaciers are heard. Many a friend I meet, Traveling here and there. But why is it so That you I meet not? I'll go on searching, Hopeful and willing, Even if it'll take me ages Following you. I'll go on searching, Because I have a feeling That in a faraway country I shall find you! - You like it? - A lot! By the way, those ghosts are still here. They looked at me as if we entered their dominion. They must be looking for treasures. I'll go and ask them directly what are they doing here. I'll go with you. Let's make them flee. Right! Because this is our territory. They do not let us camp wild! That's it, dad. Very good, Igor.
