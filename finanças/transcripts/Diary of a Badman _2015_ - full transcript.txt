- Sometimes in my own crazy way, I see myself as a super hero, fighting crime. It's not easy being a woman in the force, a black woman. I was born and raised in Jamaica, and life was hard as hell. Poor was an understatement. We ain't had no water. Psh, I had to walk miles just to fetch water on my head and carry it back home. We used to sleep five to a bed, went around with no shoes. I was raised by my grandfather, while my moms was in the States, makin' ends meet. My grandfather was everything to me, always tryin' to help the boys and girls to be better. He used to say, if he had enough money, he would put all the kids through school and encourage them to come back and build the community. That's why I'm so career-driven and ambitious. - Why these stakeouts gotta be so long? I gotta take a shit! - Well, look man, go around the corner and do what you gotta do. - Around the corner, you see where we at? - You ain't gonna do it here. - Shit, well, gon' open this door, you gon' cover me, like a good partner's supposed to do. - Jackie girl, I am sick and tired of these low-end, undercover jobs. This shit don't make no damn sense. - Girl, you know we got two things against us, our complexion, and we don't have dicks. - Okay, what I'm sayin' is, I need just a chance. And I will show and prove. - Trust me, I know. - You already know the truth. - Trust me, if anybody knows, I know. All right? - Sheesh, make no damn sense. I know one thing, my feet, my dogs are barking. - Girl! - My pinky toe is barkin'! - Girl. I can't be doing this, I cannot deal. - Hey, ladies, how's it going? - What you two white boys up to? - I wanna show my nephew, here, a good time and mix it up a little. Some miscegenation. ♪ Ebony and ivory ♪ Miscgena, what? Baby you're usin' too many big words. You gonna give us a ride, or what? - Man, sure. Get in. - Ooh, real hookers. I'll bet. - You're gonna have a night to remember, for your 21st birthday. Thanks, uncle. - You ladies are beautiful! I always wanted to fuck a black bitch. - Well, we're some real wild black bitches. - Uh-huh. - We'll make sure you remember this night. - So, how much you wanted to spend? - What are you offering? - 60 for a blowjob, 150 to fuck, and 200 for a hotel room. - Ah, all right. - I wanna fuck you both in the ass, once he's done. In the ass?! - Are you fuckin' crazy? I ain't letting you stick shit in my booty hole, honey. - I give you more! - It's gonna be extra. $200. Each. Do you got condoms? - Of course! - Money, first. - Mm-hm, come on. - Okay. Thank you. NYPD, motherfuckers! - Are you serious? - Mm-hm. - Fuck! - I needed that. - You know, it's a good thing our unit's gettin' moved to narcotics. Mm-hm. It's about damn time. Maybe we could start gettin' some high profile cases. - Yeah. I just wish that we had a different sergeant, instead of Pikowsky. - Right? He's such a asshole. - Hey, Simone? - Hm. - My family, we're havin' a family reunion, this weekend, and I was thinkin' maybe you'd wanna come and meet my parents. - I'd rather not. I'm sorry. I can't have no distractions, right now. - What? - What? You know I'm not where I need to be, in my career. - You know, most women, they just happy bein' on the force. But you, you gotta be some damn Wonder Woman, or somethin'. - Oh, that's easy for you to say, right? The perks of havin' a damn penis. I don't know. Just to tryna be with somebody that you work with, things get all complicated and, listen, I can't. - I understand. I get it. - Look, here goes Lieutenant Freeman. Hey Lieutenant! - What can I do for you two ladies? - I've been followin' that Bailey case. - And, Williams? - The department is havin' a difficult time bringin' him down, I'm just sayin', you give me a shot, I can get the job done. - While I appreciate your enthusiasm, we brought in a veteran, to get the results we needed. - Lieutenant, we lost four officers already. - This time, it doesn't work, maybe you should try a different approach. - A different approach? - Like a female's approach? Plus, we was born and raised in Jamaica, man! - Being born and raised in Jamaica does not qualify you for this job. - I was raised in Water House. And it's notorious for gangstas. I know, and I understand, their mentality and lifestyle, trust me. - I'll keep a mental note. Do not get excited. Like I said, we have a guy in there. - Understood. - All right ladies, you know what to do. - We got this, man! - As soon as you step out, we'll get a quick mic check. - Go get 'em, girls! - Testin', testin', one, two. My mic sounds nice, check one. My mic sounds nice, check two. - Damn, girls, that sounded kinda good! - For real? No. - You sure y'all not crack heads, for real? - Shut up! - Shut up, assholes! - Hey, make sure y'all put on y'all crack head clothes, before y'all go out there. - Hey baby. You got some of that goodness? - No, we don't know you ladies, man. - You can get to know me, honey. - So, he said he don't know you, get the fuck outta here! - Come on! I just want a little bit.

So, what brings you over here? - Business. - Business? - Yes, business, I'm a businessman, and that's always a priority. - You wanna do business with me? - I don't think it's possible for us to do business. Do you? Now, here's the situation, here. Let's call them new employees. They're spillin' their business onto my territory. - Let him cooler, man. I can handle this. - Da fuck did this nigga say?

And I feel like a lion enter this bombar clad, ya understand? Sometime, my cubs, them get hungry. And if I'm a goat, I fill with territory, for eat. Ya understand? - Yeah. It is a jungle, out there. And, sometimes, you have hunters with rifles and guns shooting wild animals, for sport. You know, I like watchin' those wildlife documentaries. Does my heart good, every time I seen a lion's cub killed. - Man, go take some of the soldiers over there, and go clean up them bombar clad. - Hurry, sev man.

Man, these guys watch way too much TV. - Hey, these guys are ruthless. It's our job to bring them down. Winston Bailey. Also known as Buckey. He's the leader. This guy's notorious for treating his opposition like cattle. He grew up in a farm, Portland, Jamaica, cuttin' up meat means nothin', to this guy. - Great. The Jamaican butcher. - Before the U.S., he was based outta London, which is where he started his criminal organization. He's educated, very intelligent. Do not be fooled by his valiant nature. Clifton, Kevin Davis. These guys are tight, first cousins. These guys are extremely violent. They take pleasure in killing. They're known as Rusty and Bones.

But this is what the map looked like millions of years ago, before continental drift. Akinti, Asset, come to the front and show the class your presentation. - The Olmec's original name is Nuvan, from Nuva, which is a country in Africa. They were called Olmec's by their childrens, the Aztecs. - The word Olmec means people of the rubber land. The Nuvan's were called Olmec's because, when they walked over, from Africa to America, they brought along with them rubber trees, and planted them in America. - Rubber trees can also be found in Central and South America. But, mainly in Brazil, along the Amazon valley. Rubber trees can also be found in African countries. - The natives called the rubber trees kaushu, which also means eating bread, because it has fluid, oozing out from the tree's bark. The natives collected the fluid, to make many rubber items. When the Europeans came over, they saw the natives playing a game like basketball, with a bouncing ball, made of rubber. - That was very good, girls. Hi, Mr. Bailey! - Glad to see all of you. - Hey, Mr. Bailey. - All right. Hi, Mr. Bailey. - Hey. Come in, all, come in. - Guess what, Mr. Bailey? I scored 100, on my math test. - 100 %?

That's why them call you Buckey? - Yeah, that's my younger brother. But, I look up to him. You must be a good woman, for him to bring you here. - It's about time you give me some grand children, Winston. - Yeah, and some baby cousins. - They used to call him young guard, with that ear. My boy's a natural leader. He used to gather all the youths and tell 'em they have to push for liberation. - That's still the plan. Liberation. Yuri. How the academy go? - Three more weeks, and I am done. - Make a difference, man. Make a difference. - Yes, uncle. My goal is to become the police commissioner. - Ambitious. Is he one to make a bro like Eric Ganero? We need more black police in a fewer community. - I was having a debate in class and, riding and marching doesn't solve anything. We need to place ourselves in positions of power. - Correct, Kya. Don't just become a lion. You have to step up the ladder. You see, Marcus Garvey opened up windows we can never close. - I love this discussion, it's quite interesting. I just never think that black people would wanna see more black cops. Especially not the criminal, them. - White police know of our stand. And freed, are we. Me's among the advocator, and believe in education. But they can't just wanna educate for the sake of being educated. You have to have an African mind. Or they say that's a educated fool. Marcus Garvey, Elijah Muhammad, Noble Drew Ali, Malcolm X. All great leader. Say we have to do somethin' for ourself, in our community. - Yeah, power to the people! I love when you come around, uncle. - We have to stop make them separate we. Start them off, separation, divide and conquer, that them live off of. And any all them lose, let them fish fry. Trust me, man.

And I never reach fussin'. Last time I deal with the men. - Yeah, that's right, you son of a bitch. This will be your last deal. Hey. I don't have a good feeling about this, at all. - What do you mean? This is like clockwork, we do it like this, all the time. We go in, through the front, you meet me around back, after the deal is done, okay? No problem. - I don't know. I don't know. It just feels different, this time. - Pedro. - Let me come in with you, as backup. - Pedro. - Sarge. Looks like our guest have arrived. - Gimme this. - Oh, this is lovely. Lola, Lola.

Come in, come do business, yeah, man. - Winston, you know I don't like to meet new people. Are you a cop? - Police. Carry on with the business, man. New people, bring big problems. Legal problems. - I say she good, man. - So, she's not a cop? So, then, I can check to see if she has a wire, right? - How's about you ignore me, man? All along the way, the businessman. - I know you. I do business with you, and the other two guys, that's it. - Same thing, what did I tell you? - I don't know her. - You know what? It's all right. Me can proves me not have no wire. - You don't have to do that. - It's all right, listen, me want you forget this deal. I owe our bread and butter. Me can even take my shirt off, if you want. - Okay.

Do you fuckin' understand me? - Yes, sir. - Okay. She's all right. - Of course, man, we tell you that, already, man? - Hey, have to be careful. This is a very dangerous business, we are in. - Where did you put the wire? - Downtown. - The fuck is downtown? - Near her vagina. I knew you was a lezzie. - So, did the carpet match the curtains? - Shut the hell up, Jerry! - Great. Real creative, guys. Totally uncomfortable, right, but who gives a fuck, right? - Boys. Come in, Munchie. - Very funny, very funny. America, huh? She's a beautiful country, huh? Yes, it is. - You are in a heap of shit! Are you fuckin' outta your mind? - All right, you are fucked up. What the fuck was that? Have you lost you're fuckin' mind? What the fuck were you thinkin'? I knew this was a fuckin' mistake, from the fuckin' start. What the fuck was that? - I have a good reason. - A good fuckin' reason? What fuckin' good possible reason, could you fuckin' have? - Well, if you calm down and listen, I can fucking tell you-- - Calm down? - Yes. - I am fuckin' calm! - Really? - You don't wanna see me fuckin' pissed! - He has the bigger deal on the fuckin' table! - A bigger deal? - Yes. He said this is huge. And it's takin' place with an extremely important person. That's the only reason why I held back. So we can get the bigger fish. Listen. - Listen to what? - This is big. Look. You need to trust me. - You're kiddin' me, right? What, are you gonna start fuckin' cryin'? Good. Is that what you do for Buckey? 'Trust me, Buckey.' This is fuckin' bullshit. You want some? - I'm good. Next time you pull a move like that, I'll see to it, you go back to your uniform and you'll walk in the street of some shitty fuckin' neighborhood, understood? - Understood. - Any idea who the connection is? - No, but he said something about cutting out the middle man. Some shit like that. - Don't pull that shit again. You let me know what's goin' on, so I have somethin' to tell Freeman. - Wait, what are you gonna tell Lieutenant Freeman? - I don't know. Make up something. You can be brought up in trudges, for pullin' that shit. Your wire musta malfunctioned. Where it was located, on your body. Hey, this shit's not funny. We're way too close to bustin' this motherfucker, to stop now, fuck him. That should work. - Make that money. - I'm losin' money. What y'all doin', out there? Yo, have we met? - No, wrong person, that my girl. - Nah. You look mad familiar. - Yeah? That's everybody, I'm a twin, right? - It was my turn. - Nice. All right.

I gonna handle this. - Hey, Munchie, come down to that bar. - I was gonna pick up something, for Vienna. - No, I want you to come, now. - Can I just check you in a few? - Come now! - That's not what I think. Can't blame me for that. Right. - I'm gonna call you, I'm gonna call you later. Yeah, I'm gonna, yeah, I'm gonna call you. - Hey, babe, what's up? Hey.
