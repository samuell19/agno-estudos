Dan: I want you to quit your post, Jake. I want you to take over Metro for me. Superintendent rank. Jake: What do I know about Metro? If I've been out of downtown a half dozen times the last five years, it's a lot. Metro overlaps Boston, same police power. Come on Dan, there must be a dozen captains begging for that spot. Last time I checked I wasn't one of them. What's the problem? There's a knot of corruption in that department so thick I need a knife to cut it with. A clean, sharp knife. We're talking about deep-seated extensive corruption, Jake, the kind that takes a rookie and presses him into believing if you wanna be one of the guys, this is the only way to go. That's why I want you on the inside. Bust it up. Any names in Metro I can use? I'll need someone. A choirboy. You're gonna have to find him for yourself. How about surveillance? Wire taps? Backup? Extremely low profile, no budget. No outside agencies. Thanks a lot, Dan. (drilling) (crashing) (hissing) (drilling) (hissing) (humming) Hey! Looking good, Barry! Thanks. So, where's George Washington gonna put that ax, huh? Over there? Huh? (chuckles) Yeah. - (laughs) - Are you gonna take the car? Oh, the car... I'd like to bury that car. Take the wagon honey. I wanna check out a couple more trade-ins on my way to work. Mary: Putting that on the market? If I can't get my price I'll work it out. Right. (dogs barking) (birds chirping) Get rid of it for me, will ya, Frankie? Thanks a lot, babe. Burn it, trash it, bury it, I don't care what you do just as long as it looks good on the insurance. Wanna get rid of your car, huh? Yeah. We'll take care of it tonight, no sweat. But you're better off leaving these in the ignition. Park the pig outside in your usual space, Doogie and I will swing by and give it the deep six. But you're gonna owe me one. No problem, Frankie. What are friends for? Name it. Well I, uh... I already got something in mind. There's this video depot Doogie and I got cased out. Medford video depot. It's ripe for the slaughter. Frankie, I'm one of your biggest fans. But I think you're way out of your league on this depot. They got a high tech alarm system. It's impossible. Nah, I got an alarm man. It's the real thing. Benny Brown. The best in town. Hey that rhymes! Maybe we ought to make an ad for this guy, what do you think? Doogie, would you just shut up? An alarm man? Well... that's a horse of a different color. But I gotta run it by Jimmy. Anything this big in Medford, I got run it by Jimmy first. An alarm man? You got an alarm man and you're gonna waste him heisting cameras? Come on! What are you talking about waste him, huh? Hey Jimmy you just passed the video store, stop the car. That's small potatoes. You really got an alarm man, this could be hot! What are you doin'? Come on guys, what's goin' on? Hey guys, huh? What are you stoppin' here for? That's my bank. Frankie: The Depositor's Trust? Jimmy: If I'm lyin', I'm dyin'! Frankie: (laughs) I get it. A bank job, right? What are you talkin' about, huh? It's nuts! There's millions in the vault. That place ought to be a piece of cake for a real pro. Tin can. Hey guys, a video store's one thing. We been doing that kinda heist for years. But a bank? What's the matter, Frankie? Afraid of the cops? (laughter) (phone rings) (chatter) (police scanners) Metro, Clemente, talk to me! Third and Mason, Third and Mason, I can spring a canine and a cruiser, but I gotta have 'em back by 11:00, DUI's up and down the parkway. Metro, Clemente, talk to me! Jimmy! How's my boy? Hey Jerry. Just checking in. I'm excited about today's little talk. Real excited. That's a big 10-4 but now's not exactly the time, know what I mean, huh? (knocking) I gotta go. Quinn. Spell me, will ya Frank? Yeah, sure thing Captain. - (knocking) - Come in. Come on, Gerry. Come on in. Have a seat. I've gotten word the mob's running drugs direct into Logan on single engine prop planes. You hear anything? No, sir. Narcotics is not my chain though. Yeah, I know, I know. Well, if this running drugs into the airport is true, my bet is someone in the division's on the take. Nothing makes my skin crawl more than the stink of a dirty cop. Hmm, understandable. Gerry, I'm the new boy in town. I'm gonna need all the help I can get on this. So, you hear anything about the division being compromised, I expect you to come straight to me, okay? Of course! Of course. Well, I gotta be getting back, sir, I'm on watch. Well, go! Go. Thank you. Forgive me, Captain Clemente, for I have sinned. Sir? Here we are still on our honeymoon, and I'm asking you to break Omertà for me. That's the second code of silence! Is that an Italian joke, sir? No Ger, it's a cop joke. Huh. Not a funny one. I'll let you know if I hear anything. Good. I expect you to. Oh, no! No, not again! Where's my car? Where's my Caddy? Did you guys see anybody? Hey, Lieutenant! Lieutenant! Get Hawkins from theft. - Get him up here right now! - What's the problem? The problem? The problem is they stole my car right out of the squad lot. Oh, that's a real shame, Captain. Why don't you call the motor pool? Oh, you're a real comedian. Everybody's a comedian. What are you guys laughing at, huh? Clemente. What a piece of work! Dollars to donuts, he just had that old rust bucket of his pinched right off the lot. (laughter) What makes you say that, Lieutenant? Well, you know Gerry. Do I? (revving engine) (splashing) If I knew you guys had this much fun on the job, Frankie, I would have become a cop myself. - Get outta here! - (laughter) In this game, making each shot is important. Setting up for the next shot is what it takes to win. Your wife was very attractive. Great pool player, rest her soul. Speaking of which, I never knew you were enrolled at the Jesuit Seminary, Lieutenant. That was a long time ago, sir. Jake. What do they say? Give me the boy until he's seven, and I'll show you the man? Something like that. Yes. Father killed in action. Brother on the beat, in Quincy. A regular second generation Boston cop. Third. Third? Whew! You got me beat by one! So Paul... what do you know about Captain Clemente that I don't? That depends on what you know, sir. What I know? Omertà from a Jesuit? Silence among thieves, even if the thieves are cops? Mea culpa, padre. I think I can trust you, Paul. So here's what I know. I've been doing a little nosing around. Rumor has it that Clemente is a legend in his own time. Pulling patrol heists, TVs, refrigerators, washer-dryers. Presents for his wife, his kid. Probably some other officers involved. But who's gonna talk about that, huh? Omertà? You know a lot about him then, sir. I know I hate everything that he stands for, ever since I put on a badge. Why don't you take him down then? I can't take him down because I haven't got anything hard against him. Except what? Beating his electric meter? I heard that one. But when it was tipped he busted up his box and said burglars broke into it. So the choirboy can sing, if he hears the right tune. Gerry's dirty as sin. He's the highest ranking man in my department. And it burns me I haven't got anything hard against him. This whole part of town is compromised, not just by OC, but by cops pulling their own scams with or without the mob. He's the worst part of that breed. If I can bring him down, it's gonna make an example. Are you with me? Or does being a cop mean nothing to you? That's what it comes down to, nothing less than that. People trust cops. They ought to trust cops. Anything gets in the way of that trust, I'm gonna smash. Now once again, are you with me, Lieutenant? I'm with you, sir, yes. Good. Now. What do you know about Gerry that I don't? There's this girl. What girl? Kelly Sherwood. Gerry's mistress, going on at least three years. She works bails in Revere. I've seen his car parked outside her house plenty of times. - On duty? - Most of the time. And what's so important that it can't wait another hour? Call of duty, baby. Well just as long as it's not the call of the wild. Better not be going out on me, or home to Mary. (Gerry sighs) Know what the problem with you is? Hmm? You have no respect for the law. (Kelly laughs) Oh, and you do? You bet. Gotta go. Oh come on baby, stay! - Baby... - Kelly: Come on! (screeching tires) Busting into a bank with cops, I mean that'd be history, it'd be a first. So what's the problem, Benny? You're the problem, Captain. You and the two sergeants here. I mean how do I know that this isn't a setup? That wouldn't fly, Benny me boy! It's entrapment. Entrapment nothin', I'm talkin' about gettin' whacked. No. Cops or no cops, an alarm man is always lookin' over his shoulder after the job. Lone outsider brought in to help the tight local boys. And the local boys being cops, well I figure the odds of me being hit are about even money. Not that we'd do that, Benny. Yeah. Besides, any bank job it's risky enough. Risky? This place is a tin can! There's millions just waiting. I've been prayin' for years for someone like you to come along. Let me tell ya how a guy like me lives long enough to be a guy like me. You stay as far away as possible from cops. Sounds like you gotta learn to trust cops, Benny. Cops like us could be your best friends. Why should I trust you? Because, Benny, there are two kinds of cops. There are honest cops, and there are smart cops, and even the honest cops don't talk. It's a perfect little world out there, Benny. Okay. Let's just say that I do trust ya. (laughs) I mean I'm not so sure that I can still take this bank down. Here's my proposal. Just check the joint out, and then you make your decision. If it ain't everything Jimmy says, you can jump off the wagon, no harm no foul. Ah, you're a smart guy, Gerry, just like they say. (sighs) Okay, Captain, so when can I see this here tin can? Jimmy: Tonight. It's popcorn, a piece of cake. Absolutely unbelievable! Benny's in, even splits. - It's an old box. - All right. Hell of a lot of telephone wires in there with alarm but nothin' electrical! How soon before you can make it? Can you get me in an hour a shot, say three times a week? - Yeah. - A month. Two at the most to beat the alarm. Another week to build a bypass box so we can control it. But, I need an inside man. I need a blaster. Come on, Benny! Another guy to split the take? Yeah, well I need someone to blow that vault. We don't beat the vault, we get nothin'. Look, I'm tight with a demo man, Vince Brogan. He's a pro. A pro that'll watch your back against us cops, huh Benny? You're reading my mind. Sure okay, maybe one of my own will make me feel a little more comfortable. But I do need a blaster, that's no lie. No Brogan, no Benny. Welcome aboard, Benny. (laughs) If I'm lyin' I'm dyin'! We're going scuba fishing off the boat tomorrow. You and Quinn? He says he's never done it before, and he wants to build up his retirement skills. (laughs) You and Quinn! That's something I never figured. Especially now. You think he's on to the bank? Ah, come on! Don't even fool, don't even go in that area. Quinn in a scuba suit! (laughs) Like a beached whale! That's a picture! I'm about to wet my pants! I gotta hit the head. Hey Scarzi, what do you say? Hey, Ger! Hey, Mr. Scarzi! Got the same show this week. What happened, Nick? Sinatra cancelled again? Sinatra? Very funny. (Gerry laughs) Look, I need some help. You got a second? For an old friend and choirboy? Yeah. Sit down. Thank you. What's up? Well I got some trouble, you know? There's these two guys, dealers, pals of mine. They got pinched by Metro over at Wellington. They're connected, you know? Yeah. Well, Ferrano wants 'em cut loose. (laughs) Nick! I mean listen, this is his turf, we're tight and all that happy horse manure over there, but even he knows I can't erase a drug bust! I just want you to talk to the arresting officer. He's an undercover guy. Bobby Kellogg, you know, just get him to stretch things so that these two guys can get off. Say that the bust was illegal. Just talk to him, okay? (distant sirens) Hey Kellogg, you got a second? Captain? What's the occasion? Ah, you gotta help me out on something here, Bobby. Yeah, sure, what? That bust you made down on Wellington yesterday. Oldham and Willette? Did you get 'em clean? Yeah. Clean as a cat's tongue. Big haul, too. - Yeah? - Yeah. So who wants to know? Lawyers? Eh, a friend of a friend. Owns a nightclub down on Route 1. Real connected. Anyway, he wanted me to pass it on to you, that there's a lot of real money to be made here. With the right kind of truth. I spoke to Kellogg, like I said. Wasn't too subtle, but he got the hint. No. What do you want from me? This is no good. I got guys to account to if those two guys go down. Gerry: If they go down, they go down. It happens, okay? They're small fry, don't worry about it. Kellogg's a square, he won't bite. Scarzi: Can't you talk to him again? No way! What the hell's the matter with you man? Come on! Stop giving me this grief! Leave me alone, I'm gonna go fishing. Jake: Ah, last time I was on a boat, I don't even remember. I ought to enjoy life more. (laughs) That's right. That's what it's for! Hmm, right, right. Maybe I'll get me a boat. There you go. How much does this run you, Gerry? (Gerry whistles) Well, you know what they say about a boat. I don't know, Jake, what do they say about a boat? It's a hole in the water you throw money into. (Gerry chuckles) What's the sense of having money if you don't spend it, right? Except if you don't have it! And that's a horse of a different color. Yeah, I tell ya, this baby keeps me skimpin' all the way around. Boston cops. To Boston cops. We always get our man. Oh, those are the Mounties, Jake. My mistake! What do Boston cops get, Gerry? Twenty-two thousand dollars a year (laughs). Good one! To Boston cops. The best cops in the world. Best in the world. And the outside lock to the optical shop is easy. I picked it last night when I was on patrol. Gerry: Went in, looked around. It was beautiful. The loft's got a dual set of heavy-duty sockets for grinding lenses, which is right near the wall to the bank. Now, that's perfect because there's plenty enough juice to handle the drills to get us through the wall into the crawl space, over the vault. The vault. I don't know. Vince? It's an old baby with metal rods crisscrossing the top, should make it easier on us, but nothing's a cinch. We'll drill a couple of holes, smash through with sledgehammers. That doesn't work, we use dynamite. (laughs) Dynamite, huh? - Yeah. - What are you, nuts? No. Somebody's gonna hear us. We'll use a couple of sandbags to muffle the sound. Yeah, sure. Listen, I'd like three nights in there over a long weekend. You know? Short hits in and out, it's worth it to clean all the boxes. Like some satin sheets while you're at it? Three nights. Shouldn't be difficult. Memorial Day weekend. (suspense music) Got the name of a pal Gerry hangs with. Hunting, fishing, families go out together. Everybody knows they're friends, but it could go deeper. The guy's a sergeant over in Medford. Jimmy Donnelly? You know the name? Why don't you give it to me? I just heard rumors, Jake! I'm not gonna trash a cop on a rumor, not to you or anybody! It's probably a dead end anyway. Clemente and Donnelly are pulling penny ante stuff together, fat chance of proving it. Omertà. Right. Cops don't rat on cops. Even Jesuit cops! Sorry, sorry. (ticking) (beep) Gentlemen, Memorial Day weekend, that tin can's ours. Ha-ha! Party time! Hey Doogie. Doogie, please. We're outta here. Now Vince and I'll sneak back from Florida on the 23rd. An out of state alibi ain't gonna hurt. I mean the Feds, they know my rep. I'm gonna be taking a lot of heat for sure. So remember, business as usual the whole Memorial Day weekend, all right? Okay. Gerry, I'm gonna be with your wife. Yeah, I'm workin'. The more people you see the better. Set things up. Work and play. I'll go bowling. And you better call Kelly, Gerry. Before this gets out of hand... Now, remember, five years from now, when the statute of limitations runs out this isn't gonna mean anything. But for now, this is the circle. Nobody gets caught, unless somebody talks. That won't happen. No way, boss. Don't look at us, we're not gonna cross a bunch of cops! (laughs) And live to talk about it! Get out! Whoa, whoa. We stick together or we fall apart. (snapping/clapping) Understood? I'm gonna meet some of the guys, okay? Nothing important. I don't like being left alone, Gerry. Oh baby, come on. Come on. Give me a kiss, come on. There you go, see. (Kelly laughs) (kissing) Man: (over radio) Two to one clear. Check. Three to one, set. Like buttah, like buttah! (car door slamming) (lock turns) Bring it home, bring it home. (whispering) Two to one, two to one, all clear. Go, go, go, go, go, go! Come on! Let's go! (drilling) (drilling) (drilling) (crashing) One to two, one to two. Go ahead. Popcorn. Yeah! (swooshing) Ready! (drilling) (smashing) Benny: Forget about it! This ain't working Benny! Okay, I'm gonna have to blow it. Vinny. This is gonna do it, right, Vin? Gerry, relax. Move, move! (explosion) (rumbling) One to two, one to two, come in. Two to one, all clear. Popcorn! (sizzling) (cheering) (crashing) (rumbling) (shouting) Let's go boys, let's do this! (hissing) Talk to me, Frankie, how's it going? Come on down. Whoa! Hello there, lass! Come on, baby! Give it to me now! (banging) Come on! Let me do the lock. (clunk) Yo! Whoa! Oh, no! No! (screams in frustration) What? What? Look at it! Jimmy's off, there's nothin', next to nothin' in here! Let me see, shut up! Read 'em and weep. 60 bundles, 1000 on a band, numbers don't lie, pal! Lousy $10,000 each! Oh, yeah. Jimmy says there's gonna be millions. Sure, yeah. Cops! You're supposed to know something! I thought you were smart, Gerry! Hey! - Man 1: No, no. - Man 2: Gerry. Gerry! Come on! Come on! Okay, all right. (yelling) Now listen, there's still plenty of boxes here. We'll just dump 'em! Let's just keep going! Yeah? You're wastin' your time! Shut up! (arguing) Quiet! Quiet! Jimmy! Jimmy: Two to one, come in. Let's move. It's gettin' light. Jimmy: We'll come back tonight. No way. - Benny! - Yeah, sure. I should have-- (slamming) (sigh) We going back for the rest of the boxes, Benny? You guys can do what you want. You think there's anything there, that's fine. I'm not taking the risk. Let's just divvy up, each stash his own, and we'll call it quits, all right? Vince: Hey, look at this! There's over $100,000 here. Yeah! And this. Whoa! - Whoa! - The boxes! I knew it was in the boxes! Wait a second, wait a second! This is real good stuff! Vince! Nice! Vince: Look at this, look! How many boxes are left? Eight, 900 more! We're going back. (clanging) Come on, how much? Close to a million cash! - Yes! - Jimmy! (laughter) But it's nothing compared to this. These pink diamonds here alone are worth $2 million. Get outta here! Pop the gems out, melt down the gold, another million, two easy, huh? Rest of the boxes, eight million, $10 million. Vince, I've never seen such big stuff in one place, huh? With what, maybe 300 more boxes to go? Who knows? Where the hell did all this come from? Who cares? It's ours now, huh? If it's the mob's, they'll care. Yeah, right. Enough of them live in this town, Winters, Ferraro... This could be theirs laundered into gems. I'll check it out with Ferraro. Either way, a hit this big in his turf, he's gonna want a cut. I figure at least $1 million easy. A million, what are you nuts? I hate cuttin' those bastards in! Well, it's either that or we get our legs cut off. Benny, if anything's fenced you make tribute right off the top. Yeah, I'll take care of it. But I gotta get down to Florida tonight and salt my alibi. So you give my share of the cash part to Vince. Everybody's responsible for his own cash splits. You burn it, you bury it in the basement, whatever. Yeah, I got it, I got it. What are we gonna do with all this jewelry in the meantime, huh? I mean this here, this is the haul, huh? So? What's it gonna be? I'll look after it! Oh, Doogie, just forget it. Forget about it. (laughter) What's it gonna be, Ger? You take care of the stones, Benny. After all, you're gonna be the one who's gonna be fencin' 'em, right? After all, if you can't trust the alarm man, who can you trust? (laughs) This is a switch, huh? (laughter) Sure. Okay, I'll hold all the gems. Vince, you get tomorrow's beauties down to me in Miami. Look, as I sell them off, I'll keep in touch with Frank. Everybody get's their share. Okay? When we get the cash, we'll mix it in with the rest of the haul. And remember, no spending, no flashing until the heat's off. Even if we have to wait the whole five years of the statute, we lay low. And then, bingo. (crashing) (laughter) With what we got last night, I bet we got 20, maybe $25 million! Twenty-five! Oh, my God! (laughs) Oh, mother of pearl! Shut up, Doogie. Shut up. Twenty-five million dollars! This is bigger than Brink's! Brink's, that was a lousy 1.2 me boy. Twenty-five mil! that's twice as much as the great train robbery! And that, gentlemen, makes it the biggest job of all time! All: Yeah! (screaming in celebration) Thank you, Benny! (police sirens) (reporters' chatter) All right, let me through! Let me through! No comment! Let him through! Back away now! Everything's okay! Back off! - Jake: Ted! - Mother of God! Jake: You got that right! Manager said that they wiped the vault and the boxes clean. Could be millions. Local yokel time. Gosh, Ted! I wonder what happened here? The roof fall in, you think? Hall Phillips, Federal Bureau. Jack Burton. I'm Captain Davis, Medford Police. Oh, Jake Quinn. Superintendent Metro District Commission. We overlap Medford on this. So what do we got? Well what we have so far, are no clues and big problems. The gang spent the whole weekend here and they wiped it clean. All three nights? That took guts. They must have figured they couldn't get hit. Any noise on patrol? Nah. No alarm, nothin'. Who was the walking man? We'll get to that. First we want a soup to nuts forensic in this vault. Every loose piece gets bagged. What about the bill wrappers and serial numbers? Get 'em. Put 'em over the wire ASAP. (phone ringing) Who was on patrol, Teddy? Last night? Jimmy Donnelly. Look, somebody drops a dime that the cops did the Depositor's Trust. We don't go off half-cocked. Who knows how deep it runs? Meaning you checked me out first. Meaning I followed procedure and ran an official profile on you. Sit down. Who said it was cops? Nick Scarzi, local OC. He's just testing the waters with this tidbit and wants us to pony up $500 grand before he'll tell us what else he knows. Scarzi? First off, he's not mob. He's an errand boy. A nightclub owner. Strictly small time. You'd actually pay him 500 large ones? Money's not an issue if Scarzi's gonna give us the Depositor's Trust. Did Scarzi tell you that Jimmy Donnelly, the walking man in Medford that night, is pals with a certain somebody? Like I told ya, Scarzi's not gonna play ball with us until we do a deal with him. That certain somebody I followed up elsewhere. Gerry Clemente. (phone rings) - Yeah? - Gerry. Nick Scarzi. They're after me. - Who? - The mob! That's who! What are you talkin' about? Scarzi: 'Cause I know about you and Jimmy. Come on, Jimmy's been talkin' for years about his bank, doin' the bank. They want their dough! You know it's theirs! I don't know anything about any bank. Come on, man. They know! You know something? They got photographs, they got folders, they got stuff on your life. They got a whole profile. A profile. Scarzi: They put a hood over my head, they took me for a ride. I thought I was finished. I thought I was gonzo! They got an ice pick. They cut me real bad. (sigh) I wasn't involved, Nick. Scarzi: They just call me tomorrow at noon, at my place. I'll call you. - (sighs) - (knocking) Captain Gerald Clemente? Yeah, that's right. Hal Phillips, Federal Bureau of Investigation. This is my partner, Jack Burton. We're here in connection with the burglary of the Depositor's Trust in Medford over the Memorial Day weekend. Like to ask you a couple of questions about it, if that's all right. Yeah, sure, sure. Come on in, guys. (children giggling) (door squeaking) Can I get you guys some coffee? Something to drink? Some soda? No, thanks. Captain Clemente, the law requires that we tell you that you're a suspect in the burglary. On what grounds? We're not at liberty to say. Oh, should I be talking to a lawyer? (laughs) We can't advise you on that. That's strictly your own decision. I didn't have anything to do with this, guys. You're not under arrest, and no arrest is anticipated. We'd just like to ask you a couple questions. Sure, shoot. Can you account for your whereabouts Memorial Day weekend? (sighs) MDC Friday night shift into Saturday morning... slept back here and worked on my boat down at the marina. That's it. We'd like it in a little more detail. Okay. Well, look. Can I keep this between us? You know, off the record? Go ahead. But don't waltz us around. That weekend, like most weekends, I spent with a friend, you know what I mean? The FBI? Maybe a grand jury? Gerry, what do you expect me to say? I don't know the exact times that you were here those nights! How do I know you didn't do that bank job? 'Cause I'm tellin' ya I didn't, that's why. Now listen. Just tell them that I was here. And that I stayed until the morning. Okay? You think I'm looking forward to having this out in the open, huh? I had to tell the FBI the truth. As nasty as it is. Well, thanks a lot! Baby, come on. You're my legit alibi! Anything else would be suspicious. By the way, Mary's gonna love hearing about this. Oh, now it's poor Mary, huh? Gerry, how's the divorce coming along? Baby, this is not the time! It's never the right time. Hey, come on now. Come on. Do this for me, okay? Okay, baby? - Say yes. - Yes. Give me a kiss. Big kiss. Big kiss. Want a beer? No. Confidential sources believe the vault may have contained millions of dollars in mob money, which would make it the largest bank robbery in history. Gerry! Get in here, quick! According to authorized sources... - What's up, babe? - ...the immediate suspicion has focused on a police officer. Look! It's your house! A captain on the Metropolitan Police Force with reputed connections to underworld figures... That's my house, creep! Who the hell needs a name? Find out who did this I'm gonna kill him! I didn't see who ran me off the road, Dad! Yeah. They came up from behind! I don't know, maybe it was an accident! That was no damn accident! Look, whoever is leaking these lies about me has got the mob convinced that I took their cash. Or didn't make tribute! Well, what's tribute? Forget about that, okay? - Here, keep this on. - Ow! Tight! - Tell me, Gerry. - What? Don't give me "What?". Everybody in this town knows "what"! - The bank! - Mary! Don't lie to me, Gerry. Tell me! What's it gonna take? What is it gonna take to get the truth? One of us getting killed? Mary, Mary, Mary, Mary. Come here baby, come here. Come here, come here. That's it. That's it. I swear to God I didn't have anything to do with that bank job. I'm a cop. And the mob's after my kid for no reason. (glass breaking) (Mary screams) Get down! Hey! Hey! (gun cock click) Come on! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Come on, come on. - Hey! Hey! - Mary: Gerry, no! - Come on I'll take one of you-- - No, stop! Please! Get inside! - Get inside! - Mary: Stop! Please, please! (sirens) (honking) I wanna go after the Feds, Jake. Uh-huh, that's right. They come to my neighborhood, they come to my house, they bother my family. I'm a police captain, for crying out loud and they do this! Oh, yeah, my wife, she can't even go out in the neighborhood anymore, Jake! The mob tried to kill my kid! Yeah, and they're buying into this setup real good. What can I do to help, Gerry? Anything. Name it! (sighs) Well, naturally, I came to you first, to see if I could straighten things out. Jake, I swear to God, I'm completely innocent on this thing. You gotta help me. Okay. Look, you got 40 days vacation coming. I want you to take it, for your sake. You need the break. As far as the department goes, I think it better if the Feds just think I'm standin' still. Don't stand still. Get into it. Go after them for harassment. There's nothin' to go after them with! You need proof to press harassment, not just leak some rumors! Take a 40 day fast, Gerry. It's for the best! Look, I'm on your side here. Right now, it looks like I'm the only one. Trust me! (spraying) Oh. Mastermind of Depositor's Trust finally pays me a visit. I didn't mastermind anything, Mr. Ferrara. Mr. Ferrara. Don't go too far with the dog and pony show, Gerry. Doesn't suit you. I tell you it wasn't my idea. That's what you'd like everybody to think, even your partners. I work like that. It's a good thing to keep in the background, still pull the strings. That's a smart thing. What's not so smart, is you not paying me tribute. Excuse me? Not for nothin', but my alarm man paid off from Florida. I haven't seen a dime, Gerry. Why? I don't know, I... I have to get in touch with my man. I'm not in contact with him. That's not so smart. Should keep a tighter rein on your people. Somebody could get hurt. I'm givin' it to you straight. I know what's bothering you. You got a lot more out of the bank than you expected and had your boys worried. You've been thinkin' maybe some of it belonged to me. Did cross my mind, yes. (clears throat) Relax. It was a clean score. None of it was mine. Just want my cut, you'll have nothing to worry about. What about Nick Scarzi, huh? He tells me that you're threatening to put an ice pick in his head unless I pay him off. Scarzi's nothing. My boys tell me the only ones giving him a hard time are the Feds. Scarzi's disappeared? I thought he was supposed to be under your wing? We never did a deal with him. Scarzi's a loose cannon. If he's squeezing Clemente, he's doin' it on his own. Dammit. Listen. (phone ringing) I'm as frustrated by this case as you are, Phillips. Believe me. Let me clue you. Washington's not gonna wanna be at the table if the grand jury comes up craps. Once this case goes south, you'll be packing up this show in a week! Tell me something I don't know. Look, I don't know about you guys, But I've been takin' some serious heat. I'm still on parole. Feds are watching every move. The way things are now, I can't even get to the jewels! Did you pay tribute to Ferrara? Oh, yeah, a lot of laughs. It's suicide to try to move anything right now. It's just too hot! Yeah? Well it's gonna get a hell of a lot hotter if we don't see ours soon. All it takes, Frank, is just one little thing, a ring, a watch, to fall in the wrong hands. And bang! We're nailed. Look, you can't be too careful moving it. Now look, just as soon as the Feds are off my back, I'll get down to some business. I promise. You promise, huh? Benny, I got somethin' I wanna show you. (sniffing) This is an interesting piece, isn't it? It's just somethin' I picked up. (clicking) What do you think, Benny? Come on Gerry, come on! I don't deserve this! I think he gets the point, Frankie. (snap) That's it? That's all the FBI has on the good Captain? It's not much. What have you got on him? Departmental misconduct with an on duty affair. That's it. Jake: I'm looking for bigger things. Payoffs, kickbacks, bribery. But no other cops have come forward yet to corroborate the kind of stuff I need. What you need for what, Jake? To bust Clemente down and take his bars. That's the only way I'm gonna put him and the rest of his gang in jail for the Depositor's Trust. How does that follow? I've got Gerry thinking I'm the only one he can trust. On that score, I wanna keep him spinning so fast he doesn't know where I'm coming from. Here's the tactic. I sucker him in close, get some cops to break omertà. then put pressure on Gerry until he cracks. According to the Feds, there had to be four to five guys including Clemente, inside the bank. Smart guys, and moreover, tight. Gerry's the pin, the glue that holds them together. I wanna keep the heat on him. I bust him down, I loosen the glue, I loosen the glue, I get the gang. Gerry, I hate to keep harping on this, but Commissioner Kirkland still wants you in for a polygraph on the Depositor's Trust. Kirkland? That suit? You're on the line, you should be able to hold him off. Gerry, the man's all over me! All right Jake... I'll do it. But it's a no-win deal. I don't trust those things. I'm going in there involuntarily, so they can't hold it against me. You have to sign this. You can get an attorney, if you want one. Attorney? You sound like the Feds! Gimme a break! Give me a break. You want an attorney? You can have one. That's all. I'm just trying to help you out! (police sirens in the distance) This is on for tomorrow! How am I gonna get an attorney? What's that gonna look like? This is nuts. If they've got enough evidence, why not the hell just indict me? Answer me that, huh? I can't. Look, look, look! Take the test. It'll clear the air! What's the problem? The problem is, that I expected a lot more support from the department. The problem, Jake, is that I expected a lot more from you, okay? I do what I can, Gerry. Here. (heavy breathing) Gerry, I'm telling you that somebody is watching my house! Will you stop it Kelly, this is ridiculous. I'm a cop, this is what I do for a living. I would know all this. Here, see? Nothin'. - Gerry, I'm scared! - Gerry: No need. Gerry, I'm not lying! Why would I lie? Maybe because you miss me, baby. Did you ever think of that? - (Kelly sighs) - There's my baby. Well, maybe just a little. That's my girl. That's my baby. You know, maybe I haven't seen as much of you as I've wanted to since this leave. Well, that's easily remedied. Oh, baby! Oh! Gerry! Look! Cops! Hey! Hey, come here! (squealing tires) Come on! Come here! Come here, ya dirt bag! (dog barking in the distance) (car door open) (engine revving) (tires screeching) Come on, come on! Come on! That's it! (tires screeching) (honking) (tires screeching) Here we go! (tires screeching) Dammit! I'm off duty, man! I don't need you guys comin' around here! - Hey! What's the problem? - Gerry: What's the problem? You know what the problem is! I was just investigating an accident! Well, stay off my back or I'll give you something to investigate! Get outta here. - Okay. - Get the hell outta here! (engine revving) (tires screeching) You got nothin' on me! Nothin'! What do you got? You know Bobby Kellogg? Sure, I pensioned him out of narcotics a couple of months ago. Why? I'm on to something hot. Rumor is Gerry tried to bribe him off a drug bust just before that. Kellogg didn't go for it. Jake: Rumor according to who? A narcotics cop. No way he'll come forward. I got Kellogg tracked, he doesn't wanna come in. He's up and down, Jake. I don't know what kinda witness he's gonna make. Our only witness. He won't talk to me about anything. I danced around what we wanted to know, he wouldn't bite. Said he'd only talk to you. In secret, and off the record. Set it up. Any place, anywhere. You got the word, Gerry could get the word. I wanna move on this now. Move how? Whatever Kellogg gives us, I'll slip into the polygraph. That ought to get Gerry hoppin'. Gerry: That wasn't a lie detector test, that was an inquisition! Something's wrong here, Jake! What do you mean? Gerry: I mean that wasn't the regular polygraph guy. That was a fed, I could feel it, I could hear it the way he was talking. I mean it's probably all taped and that's illegal. Jake: It would be. Gerry: Yeah. Yeah. Well, listen, I don't like this whole thing. You should be behind me, instead of draggin' me over here. I am behind you, but you gotta remember, Commissioner Kirkland's behind me with a cattle prod. Cops are under investigation and he wants the truth! The truth? The truth is that I'm being set up with a bogus lie detector test. The truth is that I'm being spied on in my own house at four o'clock in the morning, from guys from my own department. Your department, Jake. What do you mean by that? (sighs) I mean, whose side are you on, huh? I'm on your side, Gerry, but I've got pressure on me. Lots of it. I'll bet. Let's get outta here. (tires squealing) Bobby Kellogg, how ya doin'? Cut to the chase, Quinn, what do you want? I want you to give me Clemente. Clemente's not mine to give. What do I know? You know about the Wellington Circle bust. Clemente tried to bribe you, didn't he? He offered you money, you refused. Dealers went down. Clemente told Scarzi-- Well you know so damn much, what do you need me for? I wanna bring him up on charges. I wanna take away his bars. And I need your testimony to do that. Without you, I've got nothing on him. Then you got nothin'. Gerry's dirty, Bobby. He stinks to hell. And that makes guys like you and me stink too. Good cops. Even good cops don't rat on cops, man. He shouldn't be on the streets. He shouldn't be wearing a badge. It's not right, you know it's not right! Right? What's right anymore, man? He's a cop! No he's not. Nothing like you were. He's nothing like you ever were. Help me bring him down. Let's bring him down together. I need you! If you don't do this-- (squealing tires) Bobby? Gerry: One year down, four to go. You know something', Gerry? Between your boat and this cabin you're leasing up here, it's good to see you cut loose a little man. You got a little uptight, you know? Move your foot, pal. Well, if push comes to shove there stretch, I could trace all of this legit. Not like those jewels. (laughs) Might as well wear signs around your neck that says "buy drugs here". What are you looking at? Especially you. Do wonders for a cheap suit, you know that? (laughs) Dress for success, Cap'n. Just part of doing business! Hey, you know something? Jimmy's in the real estate business right now, that's right. Starting next month, I'm gonna move into a play pad right next door to him. You know, we shouldn't be scrambling for any kind of money. I can't believe that ferret faced Benny, still nickel and diming us on the fenced jewels. (snorting) (heavy breathing) Oh no, Jimmy. No, man! Come on! Not in here, not in my house! Not where I live! Come on, it's just a little hit! Let me tell you somethin', smart guys don't use this crap! Frankie uses, it's not a big deal. Frank's your new idol now, is he, huh? It's not like that. I can handle it. Come on Jimmy, man. Nobody can handle it! You either quit, or you die. Kellogg's hiding out. I can't find him to set up another meeting. Probably couldn't turn him if you did. More time passes, the harder it's gonna get for us to nail Gerry on anything except seeing his mistress on duty. He's probably gonna blow cover. It's time we made our play. Gerry: A hearing of my fitness for duty? Violation of departmental rules and reg-- What is this? Just what it says. I haven't heard anything for months from the Depositor's Trust job. This has nothing to do with the bank job. Well, I can see that! Dereliction of duty, my competence to serve as an officer? We have a unique situation here. We don't quite know how to handle it. Full hearing scheduled for September. You seem to be handling it pretty well. Jake: I'm sorry. (sigh) Sorry doesn't wash. Not anymore. It's out in the open now. What? It's you against me, isn't it? That's what it's been all along. (sneers) (door closes) Lieutenant Brill, in your deposition, you've affirmed seeing Captain Clemente's watch commander's car parked outside Miss Sherwood's home on several different occasions while he was on duty. During the course of one single week in April, five separate times. - Is that correct? - Yes, that's correct. In response to our question concerning Captain Clemente's whereabouts during Memorial Day weekend 1980 both on and off duty, his response was, and I have an indication that this was a "Just between me and you" type admission, that he spent 90% of his time meaning both on and off duty, with a friend. Kelly Sherwood. So, Miss Sherwood, you would have this hearing believe, that at no time during your four-year acquaintance with Captain Clemente, did he ever visit you at home, except on official business, while he was on duty? That's right. I mean when he was there, it was only business. (low volume chatter) You got nothin', Quinn. This is a joke! This is a 30-day slap on the wrist, And I'm gonna look good walkin'. Walkin' straight to hell. Huh-uh, walking right into your job pa-- Hey! Gerry, come on, come on. (cheers) (whistles) I'm sweatin' out a hearing while everybody's getting nice, chummy. So you guys playin' it fast and loose, are ya? Out here all alone, huh? Spending too much money, are ya? Me and Benny we got what, 25 G's a piece into this place? That's chicken feed to what's comin', when I start moving the stones. I got that song and dance comin' out of my ears, Benny. Come on, I'm dishin' out! Gerry: I thought it was supposed to be $20 million divided by six G's comin'. I sure as hell ain't got anywhere near my end comin'. I wonder if everybody's getting a fair shake. That's all. I wonder that a lot. I'm doing the best I can, I swear it! If I'm lyin' I'm dyin'. (laughs) That's for sure, Benny me boy. That's for sure. What's so funny? Hey. Lighten up pal. Oh, I get it. Hey, to me that's not funny! Cops! Whatever was I thinkin' to go into business with cops! Money, pal. Money. Hey! Hey! I'm gonna tell you somethin', you guys stink! - Hey! - Hey! (crowd cheering) Bobby. I hope this isn't just social. I'm comin' in clean. Good! What changed your mind? I thought long and hard about what you said. Clemente's not a cop, man. He's rotten. And if I don't turn him in, that makes everything that I stood for as a cop, everything that I went through, mean nothin'! And I can't live with that. Let's bring him down. Two days after the arrest of all the men who led... on possession, Captain Clemente here approached me in the rear parking lot of the station. He said that he had this guy who wanted to know about the arrest. He said that... Captain Clemente stated that there was a lot of money to be made here. A lot of money to be made? Yeah. Now would you please relate the remainder of your conversation with Captain Clemente? Huh... Captain Clemente said that all this guy wanted me to do was tell the truth about the bust, you know, that... Meaning that I should come up with some kind of illegality to get him off. No further questions. Mr. Kellogg, is it not true, that when you were separated from Metro Police in May of this year, it was for Delayed Stress Syndrome? Kellogg: Yeah. Yes. Gerry's Lawyer: And based on your understanding, what does Delayed Stress Syndrome mean, in lay terms? It means that uh... It means that I've been under stress lately. It means that, you know, that I'm kinda depressed sometimes. Nervous and paranoid. As a result of my undercover activities. And during this time when you were a member of the Metro Police during your undercover activities, did this condition ever affect your judgment? Leave that man alone! - Jake: Leave him alone! - Superintendent! Sir! Bobby Kellogg was a good cop! A damn good cop! Like most cops! You are out of order! That piece of garbage! Guard! Take him outta here! (yelling) (chatter) You may resume your testimony. Yeah. Uh, you know, I'd just like to say somethin' here that my personal condition at that time had nothin' to do with what I remember about Captain Clemente making an approach on me. I mean I remember that day absolutely clearly. Dan: Captain Clemente, based on the findings and recommendations of the hearing officer, it has been determined that you are guilty of misconduct and abuse of office, as charged. As a result, it is my decision that you be demoted. Two ranks, to sergeant. Two ranks? That's extreme, sir. No one's ever been dropped two. I'm gonna appeal. That's your right. Dismissed, Sergeant. Gerry: You've fallen, Jimmy boy. Look at you, you're going off the deep end! Jimmy: Hey! I've been hearing things, Jimmy boy. Using on duty? Dealing drugs? What? What? Gotta spend money to make money. You're gonna get hit, man. Who? Who's gonna hit me? Just don't give up the bank! Jimmy: The bank. The bank! First, I'm not gettin' near it. And second, I don't care anymore about the bank! I got my own bank! I got a snow bank. A snow bank! Yeah, I like that. That's funny, huh? A snow bank! You can ski see up that sucker. You see? Woo! Ski right up that sucker! It's a snow bank! You're fried, man. God, I don't know what's worse, you flashin' coin or dealin' drugs! What do you want me to do, huh? What do you expect? We haven't seen a dime. Not a dime worth a penny! Nothin'! Nothin' but excuses! That's it! (yells in frustration) Hey, hey! What? Why? - How's business, Benny? Huh? - Gerry! - Shut up! - (gun cock click) You hear that, huh? I want my cut Benny, and I want it now! - Now! - Put the gun down, please! Anything, anything you want! Shut up! I can't get you your whole share, you know I can't get that much! I'll take the jewels. I'll take them. I'll take the gold straight up, uncut. Benny: Looks it's still gonna take time to get it, huh? You know, I don't carry that much with me! (shouting) Come on! Put the gun down. Put the gun down. I'll get you whatever you want. (gun cock click) (plastic rustling) I don't know what you said to Benny, but it did the trick. Just a taste, pal. I'm outta here. - Carl: It's junk, Gerry. - What? I'm sorry to tell you, but it's pure junk! Hey! Don't give me that, Carl! I know that piece! You may think you recognize it. That's 'cause it used to be good at some point. I can't get you a cent for this. What are you-- I'm tellin' ya, a real expert's picked this clean. (sighs) I know just the expert. (sirens) (crowd chatters) Commissioner Kirkland called me, what do you got? Follow up on a missing person, sir. Benny Brown. His wife called it in. We found this blasting equipment in the trunk. FBI's on their way and they're gonna wanna look it over. This have something to do with the Depositor's Trust? Is that case still open? Damn right it's open. Charlie, run everything you've got on a Benny Brown. That stuff that Benny laid on me was garbage, okay? Gerry, that's what I'm tryin' to tell you man! Benny's gone! - What? - Jimmy: Disappeared! He got out on bail for this grass bust. He had a court date, but he didn't show. He's vanished! He's got a lot of enemies, not just us. Think somebody hit him? Huh? Who? Frank? I don't know, man. But let's put it this way. I think we can forget about getting any more shares off of Benny, you know? (slams phone) Damn! Damn! (office chatter) (phone ringing) (crash) (screaming) You all right, Sergeant? (groaning) I don't think so. I think I busted a rib. Well, you can go to the hospital if you want. (coughs) Freak accident? I half figured him pulling a number like that. Ten to one sick leave and pension. At least it'll be at a sergeant's rate. You must be happy. I'll only feel really happy, Captain, when I nail him on the bank job. Sick leave agrees with ya. You're looking good. Doogie: Hey Ger! You hear my theory on Benny Brown? He's layin' out flat on the beach in Tahiti, And next year, when the statute's up, it's the resurrection of Benny Brown. (sigh) Benny better stay dead if he knows what's good for him. Doing business with the IRA, are we Jimmy, huh? Just branchin' out a little. Yeah. (gun cock click) I don't believe this. We spent over four years layin' low on that bank job. We've got less than 9 months to go and you guys wanna deal guns on top of drugs. You wanna go and blow it all! Well damn you, Jimmy Boy! What are you, my mother? (phone rings) Yeah? Lay it on me. What? That's the deal, man. Listen to me, that's the deal! You don't back out! You blow this Jimmy, I swear to God! I swear to God! If I have to, I'll come down there myself, you understand? Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I'll move south. You know what's going south? Do you know what's going south? I'll tell you what's going south. My money is what's going south! You get it? Now you tell me! Jimmy: All I gotta do is I gotta go down there and I gotta find out what's goin' on! Man: Yeah? I'll tell you what's going on. They're trying to screw us! They found another source for their drugs. And you blew it Jimmy! You blew it! You're an idiot! Jake: Yeah? You're gonna love this! Mississippi State Police just nailed Jimmy Donnelly for drugs! Medford Sergeant Donnelly? - One and the same! - Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Just gets better! Feds are onto him for crossing state lines with illegal firearms. Gift from God. With the right squeeze, he could cough up Gerry and the bank. Keep me on top of this. And one more thing. Benny Brown. That alarm man who disappeared? Yeah. Turns out he was owners in that bar of his with a retired Metro sergeant, Frank Moran. Hypertension discharge. Guy's really on the edge. Check him out. If we can link Frank to Gerry, that could get us the bank. Just a minute. Gerry? Yeah. It's Frank Morran, he's going crazy over something. When's this gonna be over? You said you'd quit! Yeah? Tell me. Damn! I knew this was gonna happen! Frank: I'm out Gerry! See? I'm outta pile. Jimmy nailed me good on this one. That's my money that got burned on that Mississippi deal. That's mine! And he owed me big! Gerry: Well listen Frank, Jimmy's out on bail. He'll be back and we'll work it out. Oh yeah, right. Sure, we're gonna work it out, huh? He's your friend, isn't he? How come you're always takin' up with him, huh? You know somethin'? I should never have moved in across the street here. What an idiot I am! I'm payin' him rent, and he owes me money! Should never, never have had anything to do with that idiot! Hey! Sweetheart, I want you to get upstairs. Go. Upstairs. Outta here. We're talkin' business, do you understand me? Do you understand me? Sherry: Yeah. Look Frankie, I'm tellin' you what I'm gonna tell Jimmy. Now whichever way this case works out for either one of you guys, don't give up the bank. You understand what I'm saying to you? We've got less than eight months and we're home free. Oh, right, the bank. Let me tell you somethin'. The Feds get their hooks into Jimmy, he's gonna take us all down. We gotta take him out. Nobody takes anybody out. He deals us, he's dead. We stick together or we fall apart. Okay. Okay. - (office noises) - (chatter) Well, Jimmy Donnelly's a real hard case. The good sergeant's not talking about the bank. We got a local snitch that connects him and the drugs to an ex-cop here in town. Used to be one of your men. - Who? - Frank Moran. Jimmy: Said I'd get you your money, Frank. Jimmy. It's already been two months, huh? Make nice, Frankie! You promised Gerry you'd make nice! - You want me to make nice, huh? - Yeah. (slap) Hey, hey! Don't you talk when I'm doin' business, - you understand me? - Jimmy: Hey! You understand me? (Sherry laughs) Back off. Hey, you two wanna fight, take it next door, huh? And what's this Gerry business? Gerry says you're gonna give the Feds the bank. He says you're gonna deal us. Jimmy: Gerry says. Gerry's a loser. He's still got his bank pile buried out in his backyard like it's gonna grow a money tree. - Really? - Yeah. Well let's just forget him, huh? Now, I want my dough. I mean it. Do not push me. You'll get your money. Sherry: You'll get it, Frankie! - Okay. - Sherry: You're so smart. You wanna play games, don't ya sweetie? Yeah. Huh? You wanna play games? Okay, we're gonna play some games. (gun cock click) (Sherry gasps) Frank! Back off. Knock it off! Frank. Hey, what's this huh? Come on. I said you'd get your money, huh? Just need some time. Just some time. Okay? Okay, Jimmy. Come on, sweet cheeks. Get outta here. (- giggles) You got two days, Jimmy. (ticking clock) Jimmy: Hey Gerry, Frank's going off the deep end and fast. He's got some people real mad at him, you know ? Drug people. Word's out something's gonna be done about it. Well people say that all the time. It don't mean anything, Jimmy. Yeah, well. I just thought you ought to know. Fair enough, listen I gotta go. I gotta get outta here. Hey, Gerry. We haven't seen each other like pals, you know, in a long time. What do you say you come by tonight, huh? - Tonight? - Yeah. I don't think so. Come on, what? Is it Mary? Yeah. She's got me on a short leash, you know. Well, come by after she's asleep. Say, midnight. Midnight? It's a little late for a civilian to be leavin' his wife. Asleep or not. Come on, we can talk. We can go out and have a couple of beers. It'd be like old times, huh? What do you say? Gerry, listen. Listen to me. Just huh... call me first. Around 11:30. Okay? Yeah, Jimmy. I'll call you. I'll call you, all right? Yeah. Yeah, Jimmy. Well, you sure as hell better have it, pal. (snorting) Right. I said I'm comin and I'm comin! I'll see you in a minute, pal. (snorting) Jimmy said he's gonna get me all bread tonight, huh? (snorting) He better not be lyin'. Yeah. (clock ticking) (dog barking in the distance) Hey Jimmy, I'm com in' up! It's payout time! Come on, pal (laughs). Yes, sir, it's payoff ti-- (gasps) - (gunshot) - (groans) (gun cock click) (gunshot) (gun cock click) (gunshot) (groans) (dog barks in the distance) (Frank groans) (sparks) (drilling) (explosion) - (sparks) - (crash) - (crashing) - (groaning) Frank? (Frank groans) Oh, my God! Frank! Gimme my gun! Gimme my gun! Sherry: Please! Someone's been shot! - Operator: How bad? - He's dying! Operator: Address? 17 Pleasant Street. Hurry please! - Frank! - Frank: Huh? Frank, it's all right! It's gonna be all right, I called the police. Huh? - Yeah, I called the police! - Frank: What? - It's gonna be all right! - Frank: You called the cops? Yeah. What are you, are you outta your mind? Called the cops. Eight more months. Eight more months. Cop: Police! Come on! Don't get crazy! Cop: Comin' up! Go, go, go! Let's go, let's go. (police radio chatter) (phone keyboard tapping) (phone rings) Quiet! Jimmy! Jimmy, is that you? (dial tone) (ticking) (phone rings) Hello? Hello? Mr. Clemente? This is Nurse Hankins at Surgeon's Hospital. We have a patient here who's made an urgent request to see you. I'm here to see a patient, Frank Moran. Mr. Clemente? Mm-hmm. I spoke with you. I'm sorry, but you can only see him for 10 minutes. Room 142. (groaning) Frank, Frank! What happened here? Gerry, you scared the hell outta me. What the hell happened to-- Oh, man, they told me it was gunshot wounds. Gunshot wounds nothin'. Come on, sit, come on. I got shot through in two loads. - What? - Frank: Yeah. Easy, easy, there you go. If I wouldn't have been so loaded myself, I'd be dead right now. They had to pinch an artery right here. Oh, man. Damn Jimmy. - Jimmy did this? - Frank: Yeah! Yeah. Jimmy tried to stroke me! He tried to take me out last night! Why? Frank: Drugs. Money. Million reasons in that fried out brain of his, none of which makes any sense! (coughs) Sherry... Sherry called the cops, Gerry. Oh, this is bad, man. - This is bad. - Frank: You're telling me? You know, they got Jimmy on that Mississippi deal. And Quinn's got him for attempted murder, dead their rights. Quinn, Quinn, Quinn. Yeah, Quinn. Quinn was right on it, like he knew somethin' was gonna pop. Jimmy's gonna give up the Depositor's Trust. He's gonna bargain the shooting and the drug bust and we're both gonna go down, man! You're damn right. Soon as I can get up I'm outta here like, (coughs) like a shot! Jimmy's gonna sell us down the tubes! - Hey, easy! - (Frank coughs violently) Take it easy, it'll be all right. No, no it's okay! There, there. Hey man, what's this? A wire? You're wearing a wire? (groans) You gave the bank to Quinn. Jimmy tried to kill me, man. He's your pal. He was your pal! You set me up, man! I'm not gonna let you guys sandbag me. No way! I'm not goin' down! I'm not goin' down for you! I'm not goin' down for nobody! I'm gettin' off for everything. (gun cock click) Go ahead. Let the cards fall where they may. (gun cock click) (Frank coughs) (spits) You go to hell! Yeah? See you there! Freeze! Okay, all right. Easy, easy. Easy! You're under arrest, Gerry, For the burglary of the Depositor's Trust Bank. What are you kiddin' me? You got no proof. Frank's a co-conspirator! It ain't gonna stick, Jake. You have the right to remain silent, you have the right to an attorney-- Let it rest, will ya? I know it by heart. I'm a cop remember? You wore a badge, Gerry. You were never a cop. (jail doors clanging shut) Jake: His fate remains unknown.
