- What do you think? - You look great. - See you at lunch? - I got meetings all day today. - But you promised. - You know how busy work gets for me this time of the month. - You've been so busy lately, we hardly have any time together. - Well, I'll make it up to you, I promise. - You're lucky you have a job you love so much. - No, I'm lucky I have a woman that loves me so much. How do I look? - You look great, as always. - I do, don't I? - Have a seat. As you know, the company's been having financial difficulties lately... - Are you firing me? - No, I'm not firing you. - Thank god, for a second here I thought you were firing me, you know, with all the rumors and my marriage in two weeks and I was just a little afraid here, but I'm glad you're not. - Rachel. - Oh, I'm sorry, am I rambling? My husband says that I ramble a lot. - Rachel. - Future, future husband says that I ramble a lot, especially when I'm nervous. But, actually the word that he uses is Kiddish. Sorry. - I'm gonna have to let you go. What? But you just said that you're not firing me. - Yes, I'm not firing you. It's a layoff. - A layoff? But I've been with this company since high school... - Do you think I want this? This is hard for me, too. - But six months ago you said that if I'd agree to a pay cut, my job would be saved. Was that a scam? - Things changed. - This is all I know. - Rachel, it's not what it looks like. - Of course it's what it looks like. - People make mistakes all the time. ♪ When it seems you've lost all hope ♪ - Everyone deserves a second chance. ♪ Be strong - The good book says love is patient, love forgives. ♪ My love ♪ With faith and time - I can forgive. Hi. - Rachel. - Have you eaten? - What? - Have you eaten? - No. - Okay, well I'll freshen up and make you something to eat. - I'm not hungry. - I'll make your favorite. ♪ Let me walk with you - Rachel, Rachel, Rachel. ♪ Don't walk alone - We need to talk about this. ♪ Let me walk with you - We can't pretend that nothing's happened. - What did I do? - It's not you, it's me. - Okay, well, I forgive you. - It's not that simple. Just, we need space, okay? To think things through. - But I forgive you. Don't leave me. - For goodness sakes, Rachel. Don't make this more difficult than it needs to be. ♪ I will wait for you ♪ Give me strength to carry on - Damn salespeople. Oh, my gosh, Rachel. - Please record your message. - Hey there, I know you said you need some space, but I'm still at Grammy's and I just, I miss you. - Rachel? - No lights. - Let's go out today, it's a beautiful day. Let's go out and do something. - What's the point. - All right, that's it. - What are you doing? - Enough of this pity party. - I'll pity party all I want. You don't understand. - Yes, I do understand. Peter dumped you, now life isn't worth living, right? - That hurts. - You do not have to settle. - I'm not settling. - Tell me, just tell me you did not notice the signs. You didn't even the beady eyes, his conceitedness. Aw, oh. He's not good enough for you. He's not good enough for you and you're beautiful and you're intelligent and you've got everything going for you, and you know what? I can't offer you a man, but I have something that I've been wanting to give to you that I can help you with, so that you can get back on your feet and start over. - Grammy, I don't know when I can pay you back. - It's not a loan. - I don't wanna take your money. What if you have an emergency. - I have savings and I have investments. I don't have emergencies to worry about. You just. - Well, as you can see, you've cashed out your savings, your investments and you've even taken out equity on your home. - I did not sign these. - Is this your signature? - Yes. - But you didn't sign anything... - She just told you! - Simba! - I'm so sorry. - Get me the cleaning lady now. Oh, my precious Simba. I know just... Why are you just standing there? No! Start with my desk, start with my desk! Ah, no! Cleaning lady. - It's Nadine. - Be careful with those files. - This does not make sense. - That's absolutely ridiculous. - How could this have happened? - A good man once said, the deceiver always finds those who allow themselves to be deceived. - Pardon? - She must talking through some sort of wireless device. - Oh, I hate those things. But she does talk funny. - In the last few months you've been somewhere, given your personal information. Checks or checks somewhere. - She's talking to us. - Your mail has probably been diverted and your identity stolen, or it could be fraud by someone you know, someone close to you, someone you really trust. - Stop it, you're frightening her. - I can help you. - No, thank you. We'll have the bank sort this out. She's just a cleaning lady. - Okay, yes. Simba's okay. Simba's okay. Simba's okay. Simba's okay. Now, in the past few months, have you given your social security card or any other identification cards to anyone? - No. - How about your checkbook? Have you given your checks to anyone or perhaps written a check someplace unusual? - No. - How did you know? - You know what I would like to know, how you could let this happen? - Well, I understand your frustration, I do, but your signature is your responsibility and the bank can't be held responsible for the fraud. - Do you know how long I've been banking here? - And we appreciate your business. We're going to open a full investigation. The whole process should take 45 days. In the meantime, I suggest you go home, retrace your steps, and call me if you think of anything. - This is ridiculous. - Thanks for coming in. - I really can't think of anything. - Maybe you bought something new? - Groceries, same stores. - Well, you must have done something different. Maybe in the past six months or a year? - Unless. - Unless what? - Oh, my goodness. - Grammy? What are you doing? What's happening? Grammy, you're scaring me. What are you looking for? - Jacob Hudson. - Who? - My investment advisor. - Perfect, you've just made the best decision of your whole life. - I believe I have. - You think he's responsible? - Hey, how did the interview go? - Awful, I don't have any skills. - Oh, don't say that. - Well, it's obviously true. - No, it isn't, you just haven't found what you've been looking for. - All right. - Want some tea? - No, thanks. Got your letters. - Oh great honey, please put 'em on the table. Any luck with Jacob? - No. - Well, he should've called back by now, it's been over a week. Maybe we should go to his office. - No. - Why not? Grammy? What is it that you're not telling me? - I've never been to his office. - What? - I've always met him in a restaurant. - That's not right. You should go to the cops. - No. He's always returned my calls, always, and I'd like to give him the benefit of the doubt. Maybe he's sick, maybe he's on vacation. - Well, have you tried Lisa? Maybe she knows. - Lisa passed away earlier this year. - Oh, my, God. - She was in perfect health. Suddenly, completely unexpected. - Gosh, okay I really don't like the sound of that. Grammy, we need to go to the cops if he doesn't call back tomorrow. - Okay. Okay. - I'm gonna take a bath. - All right, honey. - Hey, by the way, what are you doing? Grammy? - Miss Cooper, you need to go home and rest. Come one, there's nothing more you can do for her this moment anyway. Come on. Come on, let's go. All right, come on, let's go. It's okay. - As I said, the process takes 45 days. - Well, we don't have 45 days. Her house will be foreclosed in 30 days if we don't... - Look, I can't divulge that kind of information without your grandmother present. - Well, she had a heart attack yesterday, she's in a coma. - Oh, well I'm sorry to hear that, but if you have power of attorney. - Well, I don't. I mean, I don't know. - Well, without power of attorney, I can't give you any information. - You don't understand, she's gonna lose her home. - Well, if you really suspect her investment advisor I suggest you report him to the police or the securities commission. Thanks for coming in. - Naomi, what's going on? - He cheated on me after 20 years, with a younger woman! - Cheated on my sister? Don't worry, I'll get that sucker back, if it's the last thing I do, sis. - You promise? - I promise! Guarantee. You pick the time, I'll take care of it. - Tonight! - I'll get this sucker back tonight. - You were right, it was someone she trusted. It was an investment advisor. - What does she know, she talks funny. Let the bank sort this out. - Listen, I was wrong, okay? I'm sorry. I've been everywhere. The bank, the SEC, the police, no one can help. - And this is my problem because? - My grandmother had a heart attack. She's in a coma, she's gonna lose her home in 30 days if I don't make a payment. You said you could help. - So you want me to help you? - I wanna get the sucker back. - You wanna do what? - Con the con. - Outside. Have you lost your mind? - On the contrary, I've never been more serious in my entire life. - First of all, you can't get the sucker back. - Yes, I can. - Technically speaking you're the sucker because you and your Grammy were conned. - Well, I'm about to con the con, thus being unconned. - There's no such thing. - Well now there is. He's the sucker, he's gonna get suckered. - Do you have any idea what it takes to pull a con? - No, but you obviously know a thing or two. - What the hell? - I'm gonna pay you. Whenever we get the money. 5% of everything we make. - 10%. - Okay. - But 5% operational cost. - Okay. - And another 5%. - Another 5%? - Finders fee, we need a crew. - That's a total of 20%. - Okay. - Fine, 20%. - I know someone. Sam, what are you doing here? - Nice to see you, too. - Carlos. - Hi. - Hi. - Aren't you gonna introduce us? - No. - Your brother's bluff. - Is he the scam guru? - Secrets are my favorite. - Where's Carlos? - In the shower. Hi, I'm Sam. I'm an actor. - Aspiring. - She's mean. - Rachel. - I was just thinking of giving you a call. - Oh. - Oh? - Yeah, okay, sure. You wait here, I'll be right back. - Oh, okay. - Yeah, yeah. Listen, a friend of mine has an acting gig. I told him about you and he wants to meet you. The auditions are going on as we speak. - I don't believe you. I think you're trying to get rid of me. - Fine, that's your loss, but don't ever say I wasn't supportive of your acting career. - I swear, if this is one of your sick jokes I'll get you back. - Do you want it or not? - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Tell Carlos I had to dash, okay? - You owe me. - Yeah. - I see you already met. - Who the hell is she, and where is Sammy? - He had to leave. We need to talk. - Take a seat. - Give me the spam folder. Sit tight. - You must never tell this to anyone. - I swear. - Once we start there's no going back. - This Jacob guy will be very convincing. - You can't trust him with anything he says. Always appear vulnerable. - He will try to manipulate you. Are you sure you're ready for this? - Yes. - Good, it's time to setup the game to pull off the con. - Like what? - We need a bait. - Thelma. - Yeah, just like your Grammy, Thelma will attend a few of those seminars to meet Jacob. - Why? - Jacob will seem to be in control and think Thelma's another victim. Most importantly, he must think meeting you is purely coincidental. And once Thelma confirms we have the right Jacob. - She will setup an appointment to meet him at a restaurant where she will pretend to need his services. - Okay, then what? - You posing as an aloft desperate millionaire, you'll meet him and make him fall in love with you. - Guys, falling in love is organic, you can't just fall in love with... - And make him donate money to you. - Oh yeah, that's easy. I could just pull a gun and say hey, your money or your life. I'm no expert here, but this is the dumbest plan I've ever. Great plan. - Carlos will create a profile for you and your charitable foundation. - I don't have a charitable foundation. - We need to go. Tomorrow's another day. Come on. - What are we looking for? - Your mansion. - Sorry, I thought you just said my mansion. - Yup, this is it. - Are you crazy? That's $10,000 per month. How are we gonna pay for that? - You have a credit card, right? - Yeah. No, don't even think about it. - Do you want to save your Grammy's house or not? - Yes, but I'm not gonna give you my credit card. - It's only for a month. I have taken the liberty of creating your online profile and your investment portfolio showing millions of dollars. - Wow. You can do that? - He can do a whole lot of things. - Now, you can't give him any money. - Or sign anything. - Be on your guard at all times. - Without being obvious, of course. - And remember, you always have to have the upper hand. - Yes, you have to be in control of the relationship. Always stay two steps ahead of the game. - Okay. - What? - Grammy, I wish you could hear me. I know you wouldn't approve, but I've tried everything else. This is the only way. You know, you drive a nice car for a cleaning lady. You're good at this. - Thanks, I used to sing in the choir as a kid you know? - Oh no, I meant the scam thing. So, you and Carlos have a thing, huh? - Mind your business. - Well, if you ask me, he's a hunk. - Here are the rules. - The rules? - Yes, you never touch a black woman's man if she has one. You definitely don't touch her money. And for the love of God, you never, ever, ever touch a black woman's weave. Her hair extensions. - Wait, that's not yours? - Focus on the plan. - What if I'm not his type. - You're definitely his type. - How can you know for sure? - The deceiver is constantly on the prowl for the next victim. The greedy or the gullible. - Well I'm not greedy. - I know that. - You're not a very nice person, are you? - Oh, he's here. - Are you sure? - Yeah. It's time. - I don't think I can do this. - To achieve anything good in life there's always the element of danger. - Yeah, but what if something goes wrong. What is Ray Ray doesn't show up? You said that he can be unreliable? - Not all the time. - Reassuring. - Something to drink while you wait for your guest? - I will a glass of your 1974 please. - Excellent choice, Ms. Livingston. - Thank you. - Waiter, I'm ready to order a drink now, may I see a menu please? - Of course. - Thank you very much. - What is it? $1,000,000? No, no, no, no, no, my, no, the foundation is a separate entity for my estate. How can you lose another million dollars in less than a month? - Jacob? Jacob? - Oh, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. I'm just kinda lost in thought here. - You know, back in the day, I was quite something myself. - I'm certain you were. - What about you? - Me? No, no, no, I've never been much of a looker. - Oh, you're so modest, but I was talking about your drink. - Um, you know what, I will have whatever you're having. - Waiter. Two Shirley Temple's please. - Right away. - No, no, what I need is a new portfolio manager. - Oh, one sec. Oh, my goodness. Oh, dear. - I'm so sorry, I'm so clumsy when I'm angry. - No, that's okay. Listen, I do worse things. - You're very kind. - Sorry, is everything okay? - Yes, no. My charity just lost a million. - Um, a million dollars? - Two months ago it was 400,000, now it's a million. How can you lose 1.4 million dollars in less than three months? - 1.4 million dollars. - Oh, I'm sorry, I don't even know you and I'm bothering you with my problems. - No, no, no, no, actually I am an investment advisor. - You don't look like an investment advisor. - What do investment advisors look like? - Old, boring. Definitely not this good looking. - You think I'm good looking? - What I mean to say was that... - No, no, no, no, I appreciate that. Thank you, and I couldn't help but notice you as well. - You don't have to be nice. - No, it's absolutely impossible not to notice a beautiful woman, especially when she's sitting right next to you. Seems like somebody wants you pretty badly. - Yeah, oh no, I'm sorry, I mean, I just, - Sure. - I need to take that. Excuse me. What is it? - You have to leave. - Wait way? - Ray Ray got the date of his bosses arrival mixed up. - To that. - Mm hm. - He has to go. Jacob has to see you drive off with the limo. - Sorry, one second. Uh, is everything okay? - But the plan is working. If I leave now it's gonna be ruined. - Get your butt out right now or Ray Ray leaves without you. - Oh no. - That um... - You know, I'm gonna step out for one, I just have to make. - Well, except that, - a quick call. - Yes but I need you to see, - is it, now, oh my goodness. - No I need you to see this now. - Thelma I will be right back. - Just tell me now, tell me your curious. - Absolutely. Order me a soup please. - It'll only take a second. - Thank you. - I say we go ahead with the plan and move into the mansion. - Really, then what? - Right, set up and then give him a call. Slowly head up. Beautiful, love it, love it. All righty baby let's go, let's do it. Oh, I love this. Got it. ♪ Find you now ♪ Oh, ho, ho ♪ My team will - Remember good cop, bad cop, and a whole lot of crazy. - It's show time. - Mr. Hudson, I'm afraid I have to ask you to leave. - It's nice to meet you. - It's Nadine, Miss Livingston's personal assistant. - Well, Nadine, Miss Livingston's personal assistant, I have an appointment today. - That's impossible. I book all her appointments and you are not on the schedule. Neither have I ever heard of you before. - Ah, well, she called me. You see, I'm an investment advisor and... - Miss Livingstone has an investment advisor already. It's that she never does anything, what I meant to say was... - You know what, this time she did. - She would've told me. - Might have slipped her mind. You know, these things happen. Miss Livingston. - Mr. Hudson. - This man claims you booked an appointment with him. - I did, simply forgot to mention it to you. - But Harold is your investment advisor. - He's been wasting way too much of my money lately. - Mr. Hudson must come with great recommendations. - Please come to my office. - Miss Livingston, the lawyers will be here any moment. - I've seen them twice already. - You have to sign the updated will. - It can wait. - You can't keep putting this off. - Well, you know what, if it makes you feel better. Give this to them so they can review it while they wait. Thanks Nadine. Want a glass? - Oh, no, thank you. - Miss Livingston, you shouldn't. - It seems like everyone knows what's better for me. Nadine here thinks that I shouldn't drink. What do you think? Should I? - I think you're a grown woman, make your own decisions. Besides I think a little drink each day is quite good for the heart. - You hear that Nadine? I like 'em already. Want a glass? - No, thank you. - Very well then. I'll drink alone. Have a seat. - Oh, thank you. - So, investment advisor, huh? - Yes, I represent various individuals and funds. Managing everything from original investments to... - Are you sure you don't want a glass? - Yeah, I'm sure. - Very well, I'll have one for your heart too. So tell me, what can you do for me? - Well, as your investment advisor what I'd like to do is help you navigate the financial terrain of the world, all the while avoiding pitfalls like the one you recently found yourself in. Meanwhile I'll be securing and growing your original investment at the same time. - Hm, impressive. - I have to say, you seem pretty young. I'm gonna go ahead, early 20's. - You should know never to ask a lady her age, Mr. Hudson. - Apologies, I do know better than that. Now, roughly estimating, what would you say your net worth is? - I would say around... - Miss Livingston, don't. - It's okay, Nadine. He could be my new financial advisor. - Well, personally I'd love the opportunity to represent Miss Livingston. - You hear that? He'd love to. Mr. Hudson... - Oh, please, you can call me Jacob. - Jacob, I like that. - What I would like to do for you is create an investment plan so you don't have to worry about things like stocks, unexpected expenditures, retirement, even a rainy day. - Rainy days? You hear that, Nadine, rainy day. - Miss Livingston, remember what the doctor said. - Damn the doctor. - Miss Livingston. - I'm tired of people telling what I can and cannot do. - You shouldn't have that drink. You need to rest. - No, what I need is a man. - Miss Livingston. - Oh, Nadine, stop being so uptight. - Mr. Hudson, you have to come back some other time. - You know, Nadine, you could do with a man, too. - Carlos, please come for Mr. Hudson. She's usually not like this. She's had a very rough week. - Oh, no, no, no, I understand. - And in the future, Mr. Hudson, you'll have to book all appointments through me. - Of course. - Bye Jacob. I was so nervous. - You did great. The game is on. The next step, you make him fall in love with you. - Okay, I'm fine. - Hello? - Miss Livingston, it's Jacob. - Jacob? - I hope I'm not calling at a bad time. I was a little worried about yesterday, I wanted to give you a call and make sure you're okay. - Well you're either a guardian angel or just looking for an excuse to make a call. - You got me, it's both. I'm seeing a client a little later on in your neighborhood, I was wondering if maybe I could stop by. - Sure. - Miss Livingston. - You got me roses. - I hope you approve. - Aren't they beautiful. - They're just flowers. - I should apologize. - No, no, no, no, there's no apology necessary. - Well, if you're going to be my new investment advisor I'd like to get to know you better. - How about I take you out to lunch? - Sounds fair. - Oh, do remember to trim the ends off those before you put them in water. Thank you so much. There you go. Take a seat. Okay, something to drink. What do we got? We will take a bottle of the De Mornay '02 please. Thank you. So, Rachel the reason I asked you here is I want to explain a little more about what it is I do and kinda make you a little more comfortable with it. You know, it's dealing with money so people start to get a little nervous. Some for you? - No. - No, just for me then. That's great, thank you. There's another place I like to go, it's nothing fancy, but it really helps me relax. Would you like to go? - Sure. - Great. - I can't dance. - Anyone can dance. If you can walk, you can dance. Welcome to Step and Two. - Vlad is a little eccentric, but he is the best. - Jacket, sir. Now, he will be your matador, you will be his cape. You will seduce him and all you need to do is one step at a time. Ready? Arm out, go out there and just roll into me. Very simple, ready and go. One more time. - Sorry. - Just roll out, one foot at a time. - You go there a lot, huh? - Well, yeah, sometimes. - You know, I have to say, this was a really excellent, excellent choice. - Well, it is one of my favorite places. - Is that right? - Yeah. - Shoot, I forgot my keys inside. Wait here, okay? Wait right here. - Rachel? Rachel, wow, you look great. Come here. Wow, you look, I got your message. - That was ages ago. - Well, you know me, Mr. Busypants. What I meant was I'm here now. I went to Grammy's, no one was there. So, I came here to check out this place. You always raved about it, so. - Why? - To give us a second chance. - I can't talk to you right now. - I can make it up to you. - I don't wanna talk to you. - Is there a problem here? - And who are you? - My fiancee. - What? - What? - Can you take me home? - Yeah. - Rachel, Rachel! - I'm so sorry for getting you involved. - I'm not. Tomorrow I'm gonna take you somewhere really special to me. - Okay. - Here you go, you got that? All right. Hey, good to see you again. Here you go, you got that? Ooh, careful. - Jacob? - Hey, George, how are you doing? - How are ya? Good. - Hey, how's Emma feeling these days? - Oh much better, thanks for asking. Listen, I need to thank you for that great investment guidance you gave me. You were right, the growth has been phenomenal. - Well, you don't have to thank me. That's my job, right? - Ah, thank you, you're a good man Jacob. A good man. - George, please. - You're a good man. He's a good man, he's one of the good guys. - It's embarrassing. I wish he wouldn't do that. Here you go. - He's a good man. - Would you stop it? - A good man. - Get lost. - One of the good guys. - They're just such sweethearts, you know? They just have you know, a lot of stories. Hey, take care, okay? - It's true. You're wonderful. - Oh. You know, it's really important to me that I come and I do this, but because of my schedule I can only come once a month. - Well I think that it's great that you try. - Do you wanna come with me on my next visit? - I'd love to. - Great. I just have more stop to make, I promise it's really quick. - Okay. - There should be a check in there somewhere. - Got it. 100,000? - Yeah, I know it's not much, but I like to help out where I can. You know, helping the unfortunate, that's my way of showing appreciation for the good fortune that I've had. Growing up in the foster homes the um... - You grew up in a foster home? - I don't really wanna talk about it. - Come here. Well, thank you for the wonderful morning. - Tonight's gonna be spectacular. You look beautiful. - You don't look too bad yourself. - I hope you like the opera. - The opera? - Nadine would you be a dear and put these in some water for Miss Livingston? Thank you so much. - Thank you, Nadine. - This is our special night. - It is? - It has been two weeks, three days, 10 hours, 45 minutes and 38.3 seconds since we first met. - You're so sweet. - The performance is absolutely breathtaking. It's a really classic... - You should answer it. - I'll just turn it off. - No, no, you should take it. Could be an emergency. - Hello? - It's all gone. Ah, it's all gone, Jacob! - Who is this? - Oh, my God, I shoulda listened to you. Five million! - Alan. - What do I tell my wife? - We can fix this. - I'm gonna kill myself. - No, no, Alan, no. I'm on my way. - I'm gonna kill myself right now, Jacob. - I'm on my way, right now. Oh, God, I'm so sorry. I promise I will make this up to you tomorrow night. I promise. - It's okay, don't worry. It's okay. - What happened? - Jacob had an emergency. - Emergency? - Yah, one of his clients called. Apparently another financial advisor gave him the wrong advice. He lost all of his money. He was about to kill himself. - Don't tell me you bought the load of crap? - Crap? - The client is an accomplice. It's all a part of the con. - Don't you ever wonder if we made a mistake? - A mistake? - Yeah, what if we don't have the right guy. - Of course we have the right guy. - Well, I mean, he hasn't done anything crazy, you know, or try to steal my money. - You don't have any money. - Well, he doesn't know that. He's been a gentleman everywhere we've been. Everybody was so nice to him. Everybody loves him. Oh wait, you're gonna tell me that that's a part of the con, too. - Yes, of course. - Well, Grammy did say that he's wonderful. - You're supposed to make him fall for you, not the other way around. - I'm not falling for him. Just some of us happen to have a conscience. - What's that supposed to mean? - I thought you were going out with Jacob tonight. - Emergency. Remember what he is. - Hi. - You know, I don't think she likes me very much. - I wouldn't worry about it. How were things with Alan last night? - He's um, he's gonna be okay. And I am taking you somewhere special. - The opera? - It's a surprise. Take a step. One more. Open your eyes. There we go. Suddenly got a little nippy out there, didn't it? - Still can't believe you cooked all that by yourself. - I love cooking. You know when I retire, I think I'm gonna own a restaurant. - So, my charity event is in two weeks from now. - That's excellent. - Yeah, and I was thinking maybe you could become my new portfolio manager. My investment advisor. - I can't. - Why not? - You know when I first met you I'll admit that that was all that I wanted, but now there's a conflict of interest. I, I want more. - You do? - Yeah, and because of this, I can't be your investment advisor. - Why not? - This is gonna sound crazy, but I've fallen in love with you. - Really? - Is that a bad thing? - No. - I wanna be with you every passing second. You know, I wish tonight would never end. No, no, I don't wanna rush you. - Rush me? - I wanna do this properly. - This is proper. Shoot. - I got it, I got it, I got it. Do you want me to come in? - No. - Okay, I hope you'll feel better. I'll stop by tonight. - Rachel! - Go away! - Rachel, Rachel! - Go away! - Rachel. - What happened, did he hurt you? - I can't do this anymore. - Oh my goodness, you slept with him. - Grammy, I can't do this without you. I need you. - Like I said, Mr. Hudson, no visitors. - Rachel. - Hey. - Nadine's not here. - Can we talk? - Now is not a good time. - Listen, I'm sorry I bailed on you guys, I... What's going on? - It's over. - Hey, I know I messed up, but I just needed a moment to clear my head, to think about everything. - No more. - Don't you ever had a weak moment? That's what I just had. Just a weak moment. I can do this. Everything that you guys tell me to do, I will do it. - I can't. - We can. As professionals. - We're not professionals. - Listen, what I'm trying to say is that we can do this. - We are not professionals. - Fine, I get it, I'm not a professional, but just... - No, I'm a computer programmer. - Nadine's an immigrant lawyer trying to get in the system so she can practice. - You're not scam gurus? - We've never done this before. - Carlos we need to, oh. - Nadine. - She can't just take off and show up anytime she wants. - You conniving sly... - Excuse you. - She knows. - You can't play with people's lives. - Rachel, it's not what it seems. - I trusted you. - Why, I never asked you to. You believed what you wanted to. - It's called faith. - Faith? It's called copping out. - I wouldn't expect that you understand you vindictive, conceited, self serving woman. - Nadine's been through a lot. You two have more in common than you think. - I have nothing in common with you two. - Sure, play the victim. The truth was thrown at you all this while, but you chose to ignore it. - The truth? You wanna talk about the truth? Love stares at you at every moment, but you just choose to ignore it. - This isn't about me, it's about you. - What is wrong with you? What are you so afraid of? - Me, afraid? Have you ever stopped to wonder why you keep falling for the wrong man? Trusting the wrong people. - You're worse than Jacob. - Rachel. - Stay away from me. - Men are so simple minded and desperate... - Cut it out. - What's your problem? - That was insensitive. - You like her? - You're crazy. - I've seen the way you look at her. - I should have never agreed to this. - If I recall, it didn't take too much to convince you. - Guess I really don't know you. - I never pretended to be anything but myself. - That's just it, you're always caught up with yourself. - How dare you? - Look, I know you've been hurt, but there's still a lot of great guys out there, here. - What, you're the love guru now? - You know, if you don't let anybody in, you're gonna be a very lonely woman. - I don't need you. - Well, you must make the required payment to stop the foreclosure. - Well, I don't have that kind of money, there must be something you can do for me. - I wish I could help you, but I can't. It's the system. Do you have to do that now? - Rachel. - Haven't you had enough fun yet? - I'll give you the money. No strings attached. - Right, and why would you ever do that? To make us friends or even? Do you think I'm that stupid? Why would I ever trust you again? - Faith? - Nadine. Grammy! - Easy there, easy. She's a little groggy from the meds and we have to watch her for about two weeks, but I think your Grammy's a fighter. - Sup man? So I see you and Nadine are back at it? - Nope. - What? Come on, I just saw her drive off. - You must be seeing things. Here, put that back. - No, no, no, you can't freaking do this, no! - Well you can't just... - I made a payment already, why did you foreclose on my Grammy's house? - There must be a mistake. There's a glitch. - Well fix it. - Well, it's not that simple. We have a process. - Are you freaking kidding me? - I know how you must feel. - You have no idea of how I feel right now. You better take your money somewhere else or get screwed. Niccolo Machiavelli, right? I need your help to get Jacob back. - You do realize Carlos and I were just winging it? - Yeah. - You're a sucker for punishment. - Well, I'd rather take my chances with you. Besides, I have a plan. - Only if evens this cause and makes us friends. - These are the rules. - Rules? - We do it my way. If you ever try to hustle me again, I will kill you slowly. Rip you from limb to limb, gut your eyes out. Or maybe not. - I love Niccolo. - Well then, let's get the sucker back. - Expecting somebody? - No. Rachel. - Hey. May I come in? - You know. - Yes. - Sure. - There is somebody else. So, that's the plan. - I'm in. Asking me all those questions. - Easy homes. - Sorry, I can't believe you left me out of this. You know I can help. - For this plan to work I need everybody's full cooperation. - We're gonna need a venue, food, entertainment and people. - I got the entertainment and people. - Carlos? - I can take care of the technology, but we are gonna need a lot of money if we wanna pull off this operation. - I know someone. I wanna give us a second chance. Just like you said. - You shouldn't have slept with her. - She wanted me so bad. - It complicates things. - It's all a part of the con. Besides, how am I gonna say no to the future Mrs. Hudson? Look at that, huh? Who's the man? Watch, watch. Hey. - Jacob. - Rachel? - The cancer is back. The doctor says that it's not looking good. - I'm sorry, I've been trying to see you, but your guard dog's not letting me in. - Yeah, they can be overprotective sometimes. - I thought maybe you were mad at me, maybe you had some regrets? - No, no, no I miss you. - I missed you even more. - Miss Livingston, I forgot to, Mr. Hudson. - Such a pleasure to see you again. - Nadine, why didn't you tell me that Jacob came or called? - Doctors orders, no visitors, work or excitement. - Well, that's not your decision to make, is it? - I'm sorry, I was only looking out for you. - No, I don't wanna take them, it makes me feel worse. - You should if you wanna make it to your charity event this weekend. I'll be around if you need me. - I hate her sometimes. - I hate her all the time. - You know, she means well. I think my sickness has been taking a toll on everyone. It's unfair to dump so much on her. - What's this? - My estate, 19 and 1/2 million. 12 if we exclude the charity. - Rachel, you know that... - I know, I know, it's not. It's against your principle, but I was hoping that maybe you would reconsider. Everybody loves you. You're the best at what you do. You will be compensated generously. - It's not about the money. - I know, I know, I know, I know. Just, think about it? I'm meeting with the lawyers next week. I have to make decisions. - Are you all right? - Yeah, just the medicine. I need to rest. Will you come in tomorrow? - Of course. - Would you mind bringing this back to the office? But Nadine mustn't see it. She would throw a fit if she knew that we were discussing business. - Sam, Sam. I'm here. She must've called him. We have to move quickly, you know how fickle she is. Okay, I'll get the files. Yes, I'm still giving her the same dose. Sam, her charity is key. Okay. I forgot my keys, I forgot my keys. Okay, I'll be right back. - How are you today, my lovely lady? - Much better. Getting stronger for this weekend. - That, my dear, is very important. - I'll just go run some errands if you don't need me anymore. - Sure, thank you, Nadine. See, she likes you. - She gives me the creeps. - She wouldn't hurt a fly. - Something about her, I can't put my finger on it. - No, no, I trust her with my life. Once you get to know her, you will too. After all, she's the executor of my estate. Just, it's not fair for her, she hardly has a life because of me. - Oh, wait. I would like a little more time with you first. - You can't go in there. - Sam? - Hello. - Miss Livingston. - Rachel, come on. Rachel. - Miss Livingston. - Hey, Rach, Rachel. - Miss Livingston. - Hey, Rachel. Here we go. - Careful, careful. - Are you okay? - Rachel, darling. - Sam? Is it really you? - Yes, honey. I deserve that. - Sam. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, well, okay. Hold up. Who is this? - Her fiancee. - Your fiancee? No, no, no, I thought that the guy outside the restaurant was your fiancee? - The restaurant? Ut oh. - There have been others? - I, I'm sorry, but babe they told me you were dead. - Things went wrong on the mission. No one knew if I was gonna make it. They had to tell you that. But the thought of you kept me alive. - Rachel, this is crazy. - Who the hell are you? - He's my lover. - What? - I'm sorry, I didn't know you were alive. They told me you were dead. - Ah, this is all my fault. But we can work through it. Put this behind us. - Don't say that. For the first time since us, I found love again. - Don't say that. I felt love in our kiss. You still love me. - Yes. - Rachel? - No? - Darling? - I mean, I don't know. I need, I need time to think. - No, honey. - Go away. - Yeah. - All of you. - Miss Livingston... - Go, now! - You first. - Hello? - I need your help. - Young man, I don't have to tell you what will happen to you if you mess with my money. - The best part about this investment is that the results are guaranteed. - Everyone knows what to do? - Yes. - You've outdone yourself. - Thank you. - Ut oh, bozo's here. - Nadine. - Mr. Hudson. - Where's Rachel? - Around. - I know what you're up to. - Then you know not to cross my path. What? - He's not one of mine. - What? Okay. May I help you? - Peter Winston. - Who? - Rachel's fiancee. - Hi. - Hi. - Everything's gonna be okay. - How can you be so sure? - What the hell is Peter doing here? You obviously don't give a damn about anyone but yourself. - You don't understand. - I hope you haven't messed this up. - Not here, ladies. - I'm gonna go get ready. - You do that. We need to talk, we can't keep up this way... - Not now, Nadine. - I'm sorry I pushed you away. - You look beautiful tonight. - Just tonight? - Always. - Ladies and Gentleman, the Progressive People's Orchestra. ♪ Get that sucker back ♪ Get that sucker back ♪ Get that sucker back ♪ Get that sucker back ♪ Get that sucker back ♪ Whoa, get that sucker back ♪ Get that sucker back ♪ Hey, hey ♪ Get that sucker back ♪ I said you better go do it ♪ Get that sucker back ♪ Hey, go get 'em, go get 'em ♪ Get that sucker back ♪ Oh, yeah, get that sucker back ♪ ♪ Get that sucker back ♪ Go get 'em, go get 'em I say ♪ Get that sucker back - Ladies and gentlemen, the Progressive People's Orchestra.

And now, please join me in welcoming to the stage your hostess for this evening. The beautiful, the lovely, Miss Rachel Livingston. - Good evening ladies and gentleman. I hope you've had a spectacular evening so far. All over the world women and young ladies have faced and still face great adversities. Sometimes treated less than human, simply because they are females. Though the plight of women in our nation isn't what it used to be, it's also not what it should be. Women can achieve whatever they set their hearts to and shouldn't settle for less. Women are doctors, lawyers, soldiers, astronauts, homemakers, filmmakers, world leaders and so much more. I wanna say a huge thank you to the men who have supported us. And now join me in to giving to this great cause. The Women Matter Foundation. - Rachel Livingston everyone. Very nice words.

Nice to see you again, Miss Livingston. - Nice to see you too. Oh. - Rachel, honey, I love you. - Peter, what are you doing? - I know I've made some mistakes in the past, but I know now. Hey! - Now don't worry everybody, he's gonna be fine. He's gonna be, he's gonna be okay, he's gonna be just... - Rachel, you're an incredible woman. Beautiful, talented, full of goodness and I love you. Rachel darling. - No, marry, marry me. Marry me Rachel, I love you. - You can't marry him, you hardly know the guy. Plus, I love you more. - I can't marry any of you. - What? - Why? - The doctor says I have only one week to live. - Then it would be an honor to be married to you just even for one week. - It would be my honor to be married to you for one day, one hour. - No, no, you know what? He doesn't love you, he's only after you for the money. - Oh, Jacob, how can you say that? - No, and Nadine's in on it, too. Yeah, I heard them talking. Remember you asked me to put that file back in the office. I was under the desk, I heard them talking. I heard it all, and they're in it with Peter. - Nadine, Sam? - Honey, it's all nonsense. I want nothing from you but love. I'll prove it. I'll sign a prenup. - Ha! You will? - Yes. - Oh. - Sam. - But I will manage all your charity's investments at narrow fees. - You will? - 500,000. I have 500,000 in my service fee. If something were to happen to me, it would all be donated to your charity. - Oh, Sam, you know how much this means to me. - We could have a quick and quiet wedding like you've always wanted. - That would be wonderful. - I will donate $500,000 to your charity as a pre-wedding gift. - Not so fast. 300,000 of my 401k will be transferred into your charity's account first thing Monday morning. - Anyone can make lofty promises. - Yes, that's why I'm also donating 300,000 electronically, right now. - Thank you for your wonderful donations this evening. - Ha, I knew you were bluffing. - Rachel, marry me now. - Now? - You said you always like spontaneity, right? Well, this is spontaneous. We have Father Goodwill and the other guests. This would be the perfect wedding. - But I, I... - All you have to do is say yes. Please. - Don't. Rachel I love you and I would never forgive myself if I lost you. - I proved my love. Prove his. - As a wedding gift, I'm willing to donate 1.5 million dollars to your charity. - He doesn't have that kind of money. - Ladies and gentleman that is 1.5 million dollars!

Huh? Let's hear it for these two kids. - Ladies and gentlemen, we are gathered here tonight to witness the joining in holy matrimony of our dearly beloved Rachel Livingston and Jacob. Be there anyone who would object to this. - Are you all right? - Yeah, just excited. Would you just skip that part please? - Who gives this bride, may they come forward now. - I feel, I feel faint. - Just, you can skip right to the vows. - Yeah. - Jacob, do you take this woman to be your lawfully... - I do. - Rachel, do you take this man to be your lawfully wedded husband? - Rachel? - I. - Oh, no, no, no, no, no. - Can someone call 911? - Only one person can ride with her. - Me, I'm her husband. - She never said I do. - That's true. - Fine, I'm her fiancee then. - So am I. - You all sort this out and meet us at St. Mary's hospital. - Something to play here... - Good evening. - Thank you everyone. That's a wrap. - What's happening, what's wrong? - 1.5 million. - Woo hoo! - Oh, my, God. Wait, what if he pulls it back. - Impossible I created multiple encryptions which produces codes creating a diversion then I move the money to another account. It's untraceable. - Carlos, you are a guru. Creating all those codes to show millions of dollars, and Sam, your performance tonight was brilliant. - It wasn't all a performance. - Oh, I wanna take my time. - I understand. I'm a patient man. - I like patient. - I thought you were still in love with Peter? - No, he was a convenient man. So after I got to Grammy's, I discovered the truth about my real father. His name was Richard Livingston, the multi-millionaire. - Wait, okay, why didn't Grammy tell you about this before? - Well, to cut the story short, when he died, as his only child he left me everything. But first, I must prove myself in order it claim my inheritance. I have a plan, but I need you. - Yeah. - I told him all he had to do was pay for the event and I'll take care of everything else. - He's gonna come after you. - He won't. The night he walked out I found a picture. It was a picture of him, his boss and the woman I caught him in bed with, his bosses wife. When he fell tonight, I told him I consider your payment for this evening as my share in the equity for our house. Two suckers in one night, not bad. - You're good. - Oh, I know. I would've loved to see Jacobs face whenever he realizes that he has been conned. - Take us home, Ray Ray. - Hey, you going somewhere? - Come on, George. Now listen, you know me, I can make you rich. All right, there's lots of money. I'm committed... - You shoulda stuck to the plan. - Sucker Busters, please hold. - It'll just another minute. Thank you for waiting. - Sucker Busters, please hold. - Okay, I thank you so much for holding. - Goodness, you're here. - It's been like this all morning. - Welcome to Sucker Busters Inc.
