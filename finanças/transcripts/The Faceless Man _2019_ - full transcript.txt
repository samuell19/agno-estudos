(soft serene music) ("Fur Elise" by Beethoven) (people chattering) - Don't. - Just don't. - I came because I heard you were sick. - Well you heard wrong. Go home. - Look, I understand you hate me. I know it's been tough on you. - Tough? Please. You don't understand me. You never will, especially not now. - Emily. - What? - You're my daughter. Regardless of what you think, I do care for you. - What do you want, dad? - Is there anything that I can help you with here? - You wanna help me? - In any way I can. - Fuck off. - Sorry? - I said fuck off. - Emily! I don't know where you got this idea I'm some evil man. We all make mistakes. I'm trying really hard here. Really, I am. You just keep pushing me away. - Since when have you cared about anyone but yourself? You drove mom insane. She's dead because of you. You nearly drove me mad. (sighs) Why? Why should I trust you now? - I'm a changed man. - (chuckles) You? Wait, lemme get this straight: You have changed. - I really wanna help you, Emily. It was hard on me when you left. - I left to get away from you. If it was for Nina, I wouldn't even have a home to live in. - Yeah and where's Nina now? - What're you tryin' to say? That you care for me now? I have cancer and now you care. Right, my poor daughter has cancer. Boo fucking hoo and now you're here trying to reconnect with me. Wow dad, what a hero you are. - You were too young to understand the truth. I never meant to hurt you and I never will. The world can be a cruel place sometimes. A man can be evil, complete scum deep down. But the concepts of good and bad are mere subjective. - What are you tryin' to say? - That the ideology behind a bad person is simply just someone who's been misunderstood. - And how is being an alcoholic someone misunderstood? - A form of escapism under pressure; pressure of a family I had to support. You can think what you want about me, but I worked day and night to support my family. (soft serene music) - For what? I mean while we're on that speech, it was well-written, had a bit of prose to it. Did you practice it a few times before coming here? (soft poignant music) - Emily, I need you to believe me. - You come here to see me. I mean someone you haven't even bothered to see in years. Runaway child. I fended for myself without your help and I will continue to do so, so just leave. - Harrison. Harrison Beckman. - I think you gotten me mistaken for someone else. - No, no, no, no. You're Harrison Beckman because I voted for you after you started the campaign against cancer and wrote that article about supporting your daughter. Our son's been sick for a long time and you've been a big help to us. So to meet a legend such as yourself, it's a real honor. Well done, Harrison. - I haven't seen this man in six years. - What? That's Harrison Beckman. - No, no, no. That's lies. It's all lies. (soft foreboding music) - It's not what you think. - You are a joke. You're not a man, you're a monster. God, you never cared about me. No, you only cared about your own wretched self. You must feel great, high-and-mighty. Why don't you just leave me the fuck alone? Just go to some country town and rule there away from me. Imagine that, dad. Hmm? Running your own country town, just doing whatever the fuck you want and making up your own rules. Oh no no no. No, but you care. You care what the newspapers are gonna say next. "Councilman Harrison Beckman, "lovable father helping his daughter through cancer." (chuckles) It's a great title, isn't it? I bet you must jerk off to this shit! Oh, do you feel good now? Come on, tell them! Tell them all why you're here! Oh I'm sorry, cat got your tongue? Fuck! This is bad for publicity, isn't it? (laughs sarcastically) Shit. Did I just say all of that out loud? Well tough fucking luck. (soft foreboding music) Is everything okay here? Never been better. Never been better.

(people cheering) - it was just supposed to be me and you going away this weekend. I don't know how I feel about Dave and Chad coming. - It's been three years now. You deserve a good holiday. - And why are the two hottest girls not getting in on the action? - Brad Barns, what do you hope to achieve tonight? - You. - Wow. - Brad, you're cool and all, but it's not gonna happen. - Hey, Brad. - Those two seem to think so. (energetic techno music) - You know, as bad as he is, he's a good sport. Why would you ever, you know? - The same reason you're not with lover boy over here. - What? Oh. - Oh hey, Ems. - Finally, god. Someone I know. - What are you talkin' about? This party is great. - Yeah, it's fun the first few times. But you know, like everything on repeat, it gets boring. - Well Ems, thanks for inviting me. I appreciate it. Don't mention it. - Viktor Nov rivals the boogieman in terms of fear. - I had the same thought, which is why I was surprised. - What do you mean? - He's a family man, very confidential. Hates people knowing his identity. - Nah, I could be a family man if I wanted. - But could you be Viktor? - Yeah, I could. - Yeah, I don't think so. These have been doin' the rounds. Very popular. - What are they called? - Joy boys. - Where the fuck do you come up with these names? - It's actually a pretty accurate description. And Dave, don't go around spiking people's drinks unless you wanna get into trouble. - I'll need a few. Goin' away this weekend, gonna need my jam. (energetic techno music) - Why are you two being so antisocial for? - Chad. When did you get here? - Just before. I got caught up at work. - Chad, Kyle. Kyle, Chad. - Hey. - Hello, so how do you know Emily? (Emily chuckling) - That's a story for another day. - Mate, we're not here to fuck spiders. That's why I fuckin' need you in my next film. - Sounds fun. ♪ Life is a waterfall ♪ - Do you know what this is? ♪ And what comes down goes around ♪ ♪ And never did we realize ♪ ♪ It's the way we are ♪ ♪ I'm thinkin' 'bout the good not the bad ♪ ♪ And never did we realize ♪ (energetic electro music) ♪ And what comes ♪ ♪ And what comes ♪ ♪ And what comes ♪ ♪ Wanderin' these ♪ ♪ And what comes ♪ ♪ Wanderin' these ♪ ♪ I'll be spendin' my, spendin' my, spendin' my ♪ ♪ Spendin' my, spendin' my, spendin' my ♪ ♪ Life is a waterfall ♪ ♪ And what comes down goes around ♪ ♪ And never did we realize ♪ ♪ It's the way we are ♪ ♪ I think about the good not the bad ♪ ♪ And never did we realize ♪ (motorcycle engines roaring) - Orwel tried to warn us, big fuckin' Brother is watchin' you. - Well when you take on that kind of image such as "Big Brother" and turn it into a mindless reality TV rom-com, what hope is there? - Exactly. See, that's the problem with society. You make a joke out of anything that has some kind of significance. Look at simulation theory and tell me with a straight face that's not surveying the people. - Oh Chad, the preacher. - What are you tryin' to say? - That you're a preacher. - Well then you're Hitler. - Where the fuck did you get Hitler from? - You're impeding my right to freedom of speech. Hitler was a fascist. - Chad, you're goin' on about things that you have no control over. Thus, you're preaching your philosophy, all right? You know, this is just as bad as that axe killer on the news. - The Axe Man. - Right, goes around kills a few people with an axe. Labeled a terrorist Muslim just like that. - I just think it's fucked up having these glorified as criminals. I mean like look at Chopper Read. - Yeah, but I like Chopper Read. - See, that goes back to my point that this could all be one big simulation. - Okay, that's enough simulation talk for one day. Does anyone know when Jimmy left? I don't even remember much of the party last night. - Yeah, I don't think any of us want to. - You know what? He stayed longer than usual. - Listen, if there's one person you shouldn't worry about it's Jimmy fuckin' Maxwell, all right? That guy is goin' places. - No, no! No, no, no! (breathes heavily) Wait, don't! (hammer thudding) (blood spurting) (Jimmy screaming) - Well I'm sure Jimmy's okay. - See, I hate it when the media uses a generic term like the Axe Man. You know, at least Viktor Nov has more character to it. - Brad, he's a mass murderer. - A subject to glorification. - A what? - Just backin' up my contention. - Just backin' up your contention. Mate, it's not a fuckin' essay. (motorcycle engines roaring) - Coffee? - Fuck. Nah, I'm all right. - Yes, please. - Sorry, did you not hear what I just said? - Have you got a problem? - Yeah, I don't want any fuckin' coffee. - You don't drink coffee. - What, I gotta drink coffee 'cause society says I have to? What about tea drinkers? Always gettin' shafted in this country. So no, I don't drink fuckin' coffee. - Huh? - Would you like me to repeat it to you in Spanish? - It's dangerous talkin' like that around this town, boy. - What the fuck is this, man? Get the fuck outta here. (dark intriguing music) Fuckin' hillbillies. - Brad, fuck. - What? Didn't you see what she just did? Rednecks, man. Oh Jesus Christ. Here we go. - Have you got somethin' you wanna say to my face, boy? - Yeah what, huh? What? - You fuckin' piece of shit. You come into this country town, into my cafe. I work 70 hours a week in here. I give you a free fuckin' coffee and is this what city respect is, is it? - All right, all right. - No, all I gonna do is call Barry. And you know what? Fuck you. Barry. ("Symphony No. 5" by Beethoven) - Got a problem? - Yeah, we got a shitkicker. - Please, we don't wanna cause any problems here. - They call me Barry the Cunt and I fix problems. (soft orchestral music) (legos smashing) (Mara speaking in foreign language) (Viktor speaking in foreign language) - My parents are coming and they want to see you. They complain all the time that they never see you. (hammer bashing) (Viktor speaking in foreign language) (Ellis speaking in foreign language) (Mara speaking in foreign language) (Viktor speaking in foreign language) (Ellis speaking in foreign language) - Is this some kinda joke to you? (Viktor speaking in foreign language) (Mara speaking in foreign language) (Viktor speaking in foreign language) - Judgments. What the fuck are you trying to spin? - Language. (Viktor speaking in foreign language) (Ellis speaking in foreign language) (Viktor speaking in foreign language) - And you make the judgments, do you? (Viktor speaking in foreign language) (door knocking) (Ellis speaking in foreign language) (intriguing jazz music) (Morel speaking in foreign language) (Boris speaking in foreign language) (Viktor speaking in foreign language) (Mara speaking in foreign language) (Viktor speaking foreign language) (funky jazz music) (wind howling) - Some people I know make bad judgements. I don't know what it is, but they continue to make the same mistake again and again like they're on repeat and that's why bad things happen to them. You tell me that someone stole the fucking suitcase of cocaine, right? My cocaine! And you don't even fucking remember because you got fucked up in some party! (siren wailing) You think some little girl or boy stole it and went to the country, right? Have you got shit in your brains? Who the fuck comes up with a story like that? Who? (Jimmy breathing heavily) I tell you: It's a person with bad judgment. - Look look, Viktor. They did go to the country, okay? To a town called Orange Lodge. I must've left the suitcase in their car, but it's Charlie LaMont's house. If you just gimme a little more time, I can-- (Viktor grunting) (axe bashing) (Jimmy wincing) (blood spurting) (Jimmy shrieking) (Jimmy wincing) (blood spurting) (neck snapping) (Viktor grunting) (Morel speaking in foreign language) (soft foreboding music) (car engine roaring) (car horn honking) (dark foreboding music) (window tapping) - License please. - Is there a problem? - Are you deaf, son? Got a report about a problem down at the diner, does that ring a bell? - No. - You know, you don't look like a police officer. In fact, you're just driving a black car. - Excuse me? - Where's your badge? - Why is it, Miss, that you look so familiar? - Are we done here? - This is a good town with good people, you hear? We don't have any troublemakers, so I suggest you don't run off the rails. Have a good day, asshole. (birds chirping) What're you doin', for god's sake? Bloody idiot. You're supposed to be waterin' the dry stuff. The dry shit. This stuff here, dry. That's what we're supposed to be waterin'. This shit here. You understand? - He did not look like a cop. - Kyle, could we get a quick pit stop? (Emily breathing heavily) (dark foreboding music) (Emily coughing) (Emily gagging) (Emily vomiting) (lights buzzing) (dark foreboding music) (intriguing piano music) (birds chirping) - You were fuckin' cruisin' for a bruisin'. - Well lookie here. Where've you two been? (bag clacking) - More trouble. - Well not as much trouble as you and Dave did. - How is it our fault? - Drum roll ready. - We already told the neighbors we were gonna play the music loud tonight. They said it's fine. - Then? - Then the owner called. - We can't play music. - Owner? Is this not your house, Nina? - I lease this house from Charlie LeMont. Never had a problem before. Wanna know why? I don't go and tell the neighbors we're throwing a fucking party. (intense foreboding music) (window knocking) - Hey. Nice. So you six mates don't wait for the owner? Well I had a complaint from the neighbors. So instead of doin' the phone call conversation whatchamacallit thing 'cause it usually ends up in confusion, I thought I'd come down and introduce myself personally. (chuckles) Oh. Not thinking of throwing a party or something. - Sorry about that. But this is Charlie LaMont's house. Who are you? - Charlie's long gone. Edward Silverbeard, but you can call me Eddie. - Silverbeard. Don't have much of a silver beard, mate. Looks more like a white beard. - That's my last name. (chuckles) It's a figure of metaphorical whatchamacallit. Yeah, some crap like that. So when's the gangbang happening? (chuckles) Gotcha, look at ya. I'm joking. It's a joke, it's a joke. I'm not like that at all. I'm really not like that. So shall we take a little look around the house? There is a little bit of construction going on from when I purchased it from Charlie LaMont, so let's start with the main room, eh? (claps) Gotcha. Right, just make your way in. Yeah. So as you can see, it's quite a spacious area. Yeah, big enough for a gangbang. Oh guys, you really need to lighten up. It's a joke. I'm joking. - It's not funny. - You don't think it's funny, mate? - It's incredibly sexist. - What's a sexist? - Look, let's just move on. - Great, good idea. Follow me. Okay, so here we are. Make your way in. As you can see, the kitchen and dining area's co-combined. So I'm no Einstein or whatchamacallit, but this would be a perfect place for a evening meal. Okay, let's go have a look at the bedrooms. Just make your way downstairs. Okay, here we are. Come in. Well as you can see, king-size bed for a king-size gangbang. (chuckles) - Look, mate. You're making us feel pretty uncomfortable with that joke. - Oh. Oh, sorry. Oh well it's all good, mate. It's all good. I forget that you city slickers don't quite get our country humor. - Are we done? - No, still got the bathrooms to see. You girls really should see the bathroom. - I think we're all right. Thanks for the tour. - Oh right, okay. Then we're done. Oh, just one thing: Whatever you do, don't go into the workshop. It's still under construction and it smells pretty bad in there and it'd be a bad place for a gangbang. Okay. Oh, one thing. If ya have any problems, don't hesitate to call my mate Barry. - Barry. - You know Barry? He's my best mate. I'll give him a call and tell him to come down and say hello to yous. - I don't think so. I think we're fine. - See, the thing about Barry is his knowledge. He's really good at everything. And to be honest around the town, he's known to fix problems. So what do you think he could do with you guys? He could help you with... Yeah (chuckles) That hurt. That really hurt. It got my whatchamacallit. Have a good one, mates. (Eddie chuckling) Have a good gangbang! (window tapping) - Okay, what the fuck happened to Charlie? - Yeah, we got the gangbang guy. - Dickhead. - How the fuck does everyone know Barry? - If I see that fuckin' meathead again, I'll bash him. (both chuckling) What? I fuckin' will. (lively hip-hop music) (rapper vocalizing) (dark foreboding music) (door banging) (Emily gasping) (eerie foreboding music) (lights buzzing) (sinister growling) (Emily vomiting) (dark foreboding music) - It's not funny. - Why are you lookin' at me? - Where'd you put it? - Calm the fuck down, Nina. - Where the fuck is the coke, Brad? You're the only one who knew what was in that suitcase. - Jeez, Nina. It's a fuckin' suitcase of cocaine. It's already-- - This is fuckin' serious, Brad! D'you have any idea how much was in there? Jimmy's supposed to be here. He could be in a lotta trouble because of this. - Hey keep it quiet, all right? It would've showed up sooner rather than later, all right? Hey, hey. And don't lie, you just wanna fuckin' snort it. - Fuck! (shrieks) (chair smashing) The fuck is the coke, Brad? - Do you need the coke? - Shut up, Chad! - What's wrong? - Our princess over here thinks it's funny. - Well it be a fuckin' compliment, is it huh? - If that makes you sexually satisfied then tell me, Brad. Where is the coke? - Nina, Brad, chill and just drink. - If I wanted tea, I'd throw a fuckin' tea party! - Drink up. (eerie foreboding music) - This just tastes weird. What's in it? - Joy boys. - What are joy boys? Do you think he put something strong in the tea? - Well if he did, we're fucked. (dark foreboding music) What's the time? - Six o'clock. - Shit. Nina. What happened to Nina? (soft foreboding music) Nina, what the fuck? - Ems, I fuckin' did it. I found Brad's stash, look. It's small, but it's something. - No, don't snort that. - Do you know what I feel like? A gangbang. (breathes heavily) Let's play a game. - What, a game? (tea slurping) (dark tribal music) (woman laughing manically) (sinister growling) (Kyle screaming) (dark foreboding music) (sinister growling) (eerie foreboding music) (Emily gasping) (Emily breathing heavily) (funky rock music) (bell chiming) - The hour of release draws near. - Whoa. You guys look very (stutters). (Zaitman hiccuping) - Sophisticated. - That's the one. - We're lookin' for group of young people. - We don't get much young folk around these parts. (hiccups) - LaMont. Charlie LaMont. - Oh, LaMont. Oi, LaMont is long gone. He did used to own a house of some sort. Zaitman Brandy thinks the bar may know. (hiccups) - Where is the bar? - Not far from here, eh? It's Biff's bar and Strong Hand Biff is a hell of a bloke. (hiccups) You just take the next exit, down to Who Valley Drive, up to Kookaburra Creek in the left-hand lane. Yeah, you gotta stay in the left lane. It's very, very very, very (hiccups) important. You see, we got a slight kangar problem 'round here, you see? So anyway, you'll see it to the left. (hiccups) (intriguing jazz music) (Viktor speaking in foreign language) (Morel speaking in foreign language) - That'll be $95. - Sorry? - You need to pay me for the premium. (hiccups) - You want me to pay for something I didn't buy? (intriguing rock music) - $95 (hiccups) or I'm callin' Barry. He said to call him if there was ever any trouble. (hiccups) Well that's it. I'm callin' Barry. (hiccups) (fists bashing) (Zaiman hiccuping) (glass shattering) (Zaitman wincing) (intriguing orchestral music) (rooster crowing) - There were masked men in the house. - Whoa. Easy, Ems. We have Nina spouting nonsense. We had wonder boy here saying he had a naked, faceless figure man molest him all night. And now you're saying we had masked men in the house? - Kyle, what the fuck? - I don't wanna talk about it. - (scoffs) So you guys stayed in the bath. - We didn't wanna leave. But pretty sure Chad got out before I saw him point. - Where's Brad? - Bushwalking. - Okay, we've got a small problem. Nina snorted a lot of cocaine last night. But I mean look at her. - What? All right, where is it? - I'll show you. (rooster crowing) - That's not cocaine. - What do you mean? - It could be bath salt. If Nina did a lotta this then yeah, she's not sleepin' for another two days. (soft foreboding music) - Good morning, glorious people. - Oh, someone looks happy. - Hey, where's Chad? - I don't know, didn't come with me. - What do you mean? - Last time I spoke with him, he said he was going down to the workshop. - Huh? It's locked. - I don't know, man. It was late last night. - Well Brad, seems Nina found your white stuff. Fucked her right up. - Fucked me right up. - Oh no. - Ended up being bath salts. - What? (dark foreboding music) - Who did this? - "Kill one." - We have to kill one to survive. (laughs) (motorcycle engine roaring) ("Symphony No. 5" by Beethoven) - Shit. - You. I was told to come by and introduce myself in full, but it seems like you guys already know me. - (chuckles) Wanna gangbang? - What'd you say? - She said do you wanna come in? - Do I need to? You lot look a bit spooked. My services required? - Services? - Right, I fix problems. - We don't have any problems. - Just tryin' to help. - You, help? (chuckles) - You're really startin' to piss me off! I come to your home and you go off on me? I will skullfuck you dry if you talk like that! What, don't believe me? (Brad wincing) King Dougie said I could skullfuck people that fuck with me! - All right, all right. We're sorry, we're sorry. But we don't need any help or mean to disturb anyone, okay? (Brad coughing) - 'Least one of you lot has some manners. - Wanna gangbang? - Sure, I'll take that. - She's not feeling very well. - You two all right? - No no no no. - That'll be $95. - For what? - For my services and gratitude. - You want us to give you money for comin' to see us? - Right. - Yeah, what if we refuse? - Well I could take that gangbang. - (sighs) Keep the change. - This is a good town with good people. If I find out you brought drugs into this town, it's not gonna be pretty. (hand slapping) (eerie foreboding music) (sinister growling) - Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? (Emily shrieking) (Emily breathing heavily) (Emily coughing) - Holy shit. - Who did this? This is really bad. Who did this? - I told you there are other people in this house. - The "Kill one" note? - Are you saying one of us killed him? Tea. Dave, what the fuck was in that tea? - Nothing that would do that. - The fuck is goin' on here? Aw shit. When? Oh, Chad. If your body was in a simulation, it would've disappeared right now. Too fuckin' right, huh? - Really, Brad? He's been fucking murdered! - You think I did it? - Well that's what we're tryin' to figure out. (dark intriguing music) (Dave shouting) (dark foreboding music) (Emily coughing) (water trickling) (soft foreboding music) - Back to simulation. (funky jazz music) (people chattering) - Charlie LaMont? - You just wait, mate. Lost my thought. Ah, remember: If you lose your wits, you lose your head. - May I ask you a question? Charlie LaMont. - Mate, you need to wait. Where was I? (grunts) Lost my train of thought thinkin'. - Charlie fucking LaMont! - He's gone. - What do you mean he's gone? - As in he don't live in these parts no more. He lost his wits. Listen, we run a good town with good people. We got a sayin' when a Charles Bronson-type like yourself comes into a bar in a rural country town, you know what we say? "Fuck him!" (customers laughing) (gun blasting) (energetic drum music) (head thudding) (fist bashing) (bottle shattering) (neck snapping) (gun blasting) (Uzi pattering) (bullets pinging) (gun blasting) (gun blasting) (customer wincing) (blood spurting) (foot bashing) (both speaking in foreign language) (Viktor speaking in foreign language) - Eddie. Eddie owns the house now. Charlie LaMont went mad in that house, lost his wits. They say it's cursed. It's not far from here, just a few miles away give or take. Here. It's the address. (keypad beeping) - Where the fuck have you been? - I've been tryin' to find Brad. I thought maybe I could talk some sense into him. - Well Dave and Chad have vanished, okay? We need to find Brad and stick together. This is fucked! (Kyle gasping) (axe bashing) (dark foreboding music) - Run! (axe clanging) (Kyle grunting) (axe clinking) - Quick. It's all right. (Nina breathing heavily) Shh, shh, shh. Stay. (door clacking) (Nina breathing heavily) (Nina shrieking) (blood spurting) (soft foreboding music) (Emily wincing) (Nina weeping) - The girls? - You just wanted that gangbang. - I'm not like that, Barry. - What happened to the Indian? - He's dead. - Don't understand these city folk. Always tryin' to backstab their mates. - The Axe. - What? - That's his name. - The Axe? - Yeah, he kills people with an axe. It was on the news. - I don't watch the news. - Barry, you might need to start watchin' You might learn somethin'. - It's all full of propaganda and bullshit anyway. I make my own news. - Barry, we caught the Ax, a serial killer whatchamacallit. Yeah, sorta they take so many drugs that they don't even know who they are and it messes with their brain circuitry thingamajig. If they didn't take drugs, they'd be like us. - At least we can purge this town. Those rights given to us by King Dougie himself. (Eddie chuckling) Anyway, my deeds need to be taken care of. Serial killer whatchamacallit or not. - You take that one. - I did want the girl. You know, the ginger. Got a thing for redheads. - Yeah, well improvisation works. - Not that I want to, but this one needs to be taught a lesson the hard way. - Hmm. - No, no, no! (shouts) (soft foreboding music) (fists bashing) (Brad shouting) - So I'm only gonna say this once: We are not bad folk. No, no, I repeat we are not bad folk. This is a good town with good people. The reason we do what we do is to purge this country. You seem a little confused. That's fine. That's fine. But you did bring drugs into the town into my house. It's like a disease, locusts. It's as if Satan infected the lot of ya. So me and Barry, we're doin' our best to give back to you lot like you gave to the town. (Brad shouting) (sighs) But you see, someone killed the Indian. So I have to play god and I have to play you lot out like I helped Charlie LaMont with his drug problem. It's like Strong Hand Biff said, "Poor sod lost his wits." (Brad shouting) (soft foreboding music) See, I see the fear. (chuckles maniacally) (sniffs) Can even smell it. Now you seem like the sorta guy that would try to please everybody all the time. You would never take anythin' by force and these mongrels woulda taken whatever they wanted off ya. Well son, I'm here to tell you that you can take whatever you want. This world is live or die, so that's how you get your? (Eddie vocalizing) - Gangbang. - Yes, that's a good boy. (chuckles) (dark foreboding music) - Redheads have always been better. - Barry, take it off. (man wincing) See, this is what happens when you bring drugs into my house. This is what happens when you bring drugs into my town! - 10 days in that purge suit whatchamacallit, you'll all think twice about doin' drugs again. - Barry, get the other purge suits out. - Where are you goin'? - I gotta go to the crapper. - Now? - It's a vegan diet. It's a bit of diarrhea. Sorry to keep you blokes tied up longer than you have to be. - See if you'd not brought drugs into this town, none of this woulda happened. Because of drugs, I lost me mom. I lost me dad. Lost me whole family. But now, you're in Barry's world.

Can't a bloke take a crap in peace? Who the hell are you? You killed Barry. - Barry killed Boris and Morel. - Barry was a good bloke. Barry used to fix things and Barry was good at it. People liked Barry. - Barry's dead now. Sit. - I ain't sittin' for you. (gun blasting) (Eddie wincing) - When I say sit, people sit. Boris and Morel, they were good quiet men. They were good people and now they dead. Do you know who I am? Yeah. - You're a wanker and you aren't gonna make it outta this town alive. (spits) - We'll see. (Eddie wincing) (chainsaw roaring) (blood spurting) (Kyle wincing) (dark foreboding music) I love the smell of anesthetics in the morning. (Nina weeping) - It's okay, it's okay.

All I wanna know is where is my suitcase of cocaine? Where the fuck is it? - I don't know. I don't know, I don't know. (Viktor shouting in foreign language) I don't know. (Viktor shouting in foreign language) I don't know, I don't know. (Viktor shouting in foreign language) I don't know. (Viktor shouting in foreign language) I don't know. (Viktor shouting in foreign language) I don't know. (weeps) - Do you remember what I did in that room? You remember, yes? Then where is it? - I don't know. (Kyle wincing) - No! - We have a problem here. I came here to get what is mine. In that journey, I lost two of my men. Two men who were like a family to me. - I'll get you the suitcase. - Nah. The price is gonna be much higher now. I know it's hard to face who you are, to become what you fear, to die for a mistake you made, for a bad judgment you foresaw. (Emily wincing) (Viktor shouting in foreign language) (pole bashing) (dark foreboding music) - Ems. Emily. Ems! - Get out. Get outta my fucking head! - Emily, I care for you. I'm here. - Fuck off! (breathes heavily) - I wanna help you. (soft foreboding music) - Don't you get it? - Get what? - I will never care for you that way. Never. (dark foreboding music) You're a stupid fucking idiot. (winces) (dark foreboding music) (bed creaking) (breathes heavily) No. (Emily wincing) (Kyle panting) (dark intriguing music) (knife slashing) (dark foreboding music) (Emily vomiting) (eerie foreboding music) (soft foreboding music) (bell clinking) (car engine roaring) - I'm gonna count to 10. And when I do, I want you all outside! One, two, 10. (guns pattering) (bullets pinging) ("Don Giovanni, Overture, K. 527" by Mozart) (motorcycle engines roaring) Keep the change, you filthy animal. Always wanted to do that. (birds chirping) - That's the one! - Well check the house, make sure Barry and Eddie are okay. Bring over that drunkard. Why is it that you look so familiar? - They're dead! - Barry and Eddie? - Yes and a few faces I don't even know! - Look if you let us go, there is a suitcase inside worth a lot of money. - That won't cut it with me, sweetheart. We do things my way around here. It's my way or the bloody highway! (cellphone ringing) - Hand it over. - Viktor, where are you? - Hello? - Who is this? - Yeah, this is King Dougie. - Dougie? - King. You know, King's my first name. Dougie's my last. - Put my husband back on the phone now. You listen to me, I don't care who you are. Put my fucking husband back on the phone. - Oh Viktor. No, he's a little tied up at the moment. - I said put Viktor on the fucking phone! My parents-- - What? - Have been waiting all night to see him. - Your parents? You want him to meet your parents. I don't think he'll meet your parents in quite a while. - I am his wife, dammit! Put Viktor on that phone or I will get in my car, drive down and I will burn you, ya fuckwit! Do ya hear me? - Do you know who I am? - I don't care who you are! (machete bashing) (blood spurting) (eerie foreboding music) (body thudding) - This is what happens when you lose your wits! Fuck him. - (chuckles) Do you think I care about money? All I care about is my town. Now all I've got here is a house full of dead folk. - And a monster. - Monster? - What are you talkin' about? Now I know where I've seen you before. It took me a while, but now I've got it. You're the girl from that hospital. You had a big argument with your dad just before you went in for treatment. My wife was there that morning and she died a few months later; complications from chemotherapy. But I must say that after you made that speech of yours, I got myself a job in this town and decided to become the boss, make the rules, mold this town and the people within it to my way of liking. You see, we've got a very strong no-drug policy in this town and we've had it for quite a while. We managed to filter out all the bad folk and I've gotta thank you for that you know, for makin' the speech of yours. Because it made me the man that I am and the future of this town. You know, I'm starting to like your little friend here. And you know what? Carrot top can stay, you go. - I'm not leaving without her. - Oh, I suggest you do because you're in my good book. Not many people are in my good book. You've earned the right to leave. - I said I'm not leaving without Nina. (Biff grunting) (Nina shrieking) - Tie her to the front of the car, Biff. Whatever you do, don't kill her. I like 'em wild. (fist bashing) (Nina shrieking) - What in the actual fuck? I told you I'm not leaving without her! - Buttercup, don't you ever talk to me like that again or I'll take your eye out with this king-sized knife. Carrot top is not a part of the deal. (waves whooshing) (dark foreboding music) (Emily shrieking) (fist pounding) (Emily weeping) (Emily shrieking) (dark foreboding music) (eerie foreboding music) (blood splattering) (man wincing) (man screaming) - What's up, boss? - Now Biff, who do you think the character in this story is? And for the little people who ask the question, yes, you don't have to be around for a long time to become the main fucking man. And for the critics with their wild imagination and sophisticated write-ups, this is the new age where men shall be free to say what they want. This is King Dougie's story. (gun pattering) (bikers shouting) Not the Axe Man, not the girls or that propaganda and bullshit. We need mysteries for the little people to talk about. And if what carrot top says is true and there is a monster in there, then I wanna add it to my lists of achievements or whatchama call it. (dark foreboding music) (gun blasting) (glass shattering) Well that was a disappointment. (dark snarling) (gun pattering) (King shouting) (dark foreboding music) (sinister growling) (Nina shrieking) (dark intriguing music) ("Fur Elise" by Beethoven) - Is this a joke?
