I'I'm Today oa Mary Ann Eosito. Sebadas from Sardinia. USIC] ao, I'm Mary A Esposito. Welcome to Italy and let's cook real Italian. Aren't they gorgeous? Swiss chard. I knew you said that. I'm in heaven. Think about how healthy this is. That's for you. Sunday sauce. All 20 regions of Italy are fabulous. And every time I do this, I think of my Nonna Galasso causshe waysmadet th way You want a Goldilocks dough; just right. Who doesn't like basil, especially in the summer? Obviously, you have to have pesto sauce at some point, right? I mean, I'm a cook, why can't I try it? You're the best. >> No, you're the best. [LAUGHTER] >> Fding for Co Italia was de po[MUSIC]by: >> Sardinia. Sardegna. Home to really dear friends of mine and today I think I really wanna dedicate this program to them, Mario and Julia Cockle, because they were the first ones who introduced me to Sardinia. And when I went there, I found a culture that was so different from mainland Italy and also from Sicily, and today, I'm going to make a classic recipe from Sardinia that Mario and Julia taught me how to make. So what is it? Well, it's called Seba. Yes, Sebadas. And what are they? Well, they're a pastry. A pastry that's made with a dough that encases pecorino cheese and then it's fried and then it's topped with honey. So, this is for you, Mario and Julia, and I hope I get this right. So, you have to start with some pecorino cheese because in Sardinia, there's a lot of pecorino cheese and this is a pastry that was usually eaten by the shepherds as they were taking their herds from place to place. So they would take the sheep and they would move them to higher pasture grounds and when they were done with that, they'd go somewhere else and this was called the transumanza and this is what they would have to eat because there was a lot of cheese, obviously. So, here we have . You can see how easy this slices and whenever you're slicing cheese, a soft cheese, use a cheese knife. This is a cheese knife. Sometimes it's called an angel food cake knife but it's good for very soft foods. Tomatoes too. It's often called a tomato knife. And I'm just going to cut this cheese up into small pieces. You need about a pound of cheese for this recipe. , once it's cut up, then we have to melt this cheese because this becomes the filling. So, we have to start in a pan and let me get this going here. So, let me get that up to speed before I put that in. So we're gonna melt the cheese with some water, about, I would say two tablespoons of water in a pan. Thithen you havege thisito allow it to chill and oh before I forget, do you like my necklace? Isn't it pretty? This is from Sardinia. This was given to me by Mario and Julia and this intricate design is what reminds me so much of the type of culture that you find in Sardinia with very fine crafts that are made by hand, lace things, beautiful things. So I'm wearing this in honor of them and you can admire that. Pretty, huh? OK so we have the water in the pan. We're going to add the cheese and we allow this to melt. So while it's melting, we want to grate up some orange zest. Now, some people like to use lemon zest for t, but m nna e th angeest caus that's what Julia would have used and when I, talked to her, about doing this recipe, she was- Sulmade. She was on the high seas with her husband Mario, because they have a boat and they go around in Sardinia and other places during the summer months. So grate up the zest of two oranges. I don't know, this isn't working very well. Let me see what we got here. Ze of o orges orf-- you want to use lemons, you can use lemons. So how did I meet Mario and Julia? Well let me tell you that story. Mariand liahaenedo ben n in Spain. Yeah. We do get out of Italy once in a . So they were on a train in Spain. I was on the same train. Happened to be in the ladies room, and all of a sudden this elegant woman comes in who is Danish by the way. Julia is not-- she's not Sardinian. She's married-- she's married to a Sardinian. So, she came in and I happened to be doing a television program on the train called, Dinner on the Diner. So she came in and she said, "Are you the woman who's doing the cooking on the train"? I said, ''Yes I am.'' So, from that moment on, we started to hang out, having dinner on the train, that kind of thing. We kept in touch after leaving- Spain and we started to just communicate with one another. Here's the cheese. I'll tell you the rest of the story in a minute but look at how That's why you wanna nicuse a young cheese. This would not work with an aged cheese. I'm gonna turn the heat down a little bit on that as I continue on. Anyw, long story short, eventually, Mario and Julia came to visit me here in my home and- then I went to visit them in Sa. And you know what I remember best about Sardinia? The color of the water, was absolutely fantastic. This aquamarine blue color. It was fantastic, and the sand was very, very coarse. So, when you walked bare foot in the sand, it gave you kind of like a, you know, kind of cleaned your feet, little pedicure, that kind of thing. Your feet were very soft afterwards. And the food of Sardinia is really special. I especially love the grilled eels. They're absolutely delicious serv over fire with myrtle leaves, delicious and they make fabulous breads. You probably know one of the famous breads of Sardinia is the Carta da . Thin, thin sheets of bread that are as thin as a sheet of music paper, and that's why it's called Carta da musica. All right. This is looking good. We need to still melt a few pieces there, so I'm gonna keep an eye on that. There's my orange zest. Now we need with this some fresh mint. So in my travels, I find these neat little gadgets. Nobody pays me to advertise this stuff but, in here we have some mint leaves so I gon put a w inhere and see how well this works cause this saves me having to do it by hand. OK. So there's our mint leaves and then we just- isn't that cool? Hey, love it, and it smells very minty. So we have finely minced mint. We've got orange zest and we've got cheese that is almost melted. I'm not ing add any salt to this because of course the cheese is salty enough. at wre gna dwithhis, cso, we have tose spread this out onto a bake sheet and we have to allow it to get cold because we are gonna have to cut this out into circles to go into our pastry. All right. Now the cheese is fully melted. Doesn't that look good? OK. I'm gonna turn this off and add my mint. I'gonnadMix this around. So pretty just to look at it and of course the heat is just exuding that flavor and smell of mint. OK. That's looking good. Anthiss gog righon this tray. I would do this on a non-stick sheet or you could put a piece of parchment paper over a baking sheet. You just wanna spread that out it's even. OK. All that's looking g, and that now goes in the refrigerator to chill for about 35-45 minute. You could actually do this part the day before. Now that we have the filling that's chilling, we can work on the dough. So traditionally, the doh stts wh durum semolina flour and that's what we have here. And this is a finer grind of semolina flour as you can see by the color itself. It'there's a yellowular ftint to it. Soit ia fi gri So, we have three cups ofur flo. here and we're going to give it just a little tad of salt. A little salt. And then, we're going to add some water and olive . That's all that goes into the dough. So, let'start with about a hal- and about three tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil. Traditionally though, they didn't use , they used lard. But you know what a no, no that is. So, now, you mix this together and add engh wer to cate doug SoI'm st ing addhis a little bit at a time until I get something that is a ball of dough that we're gonna let rest for about 30 minutes. Anyway, when I consulted with Julia about this recipe, she was very helpful, gave me all that history about the sheprdswho ok this on their Transumanza journeys with them to eat as they moved their herds of sheep from place to place. So, I went to visit them, as I said, in Sardinia. They lived in Cagliari at that time, which is a big port city in Sardinia, and it's very rural. So many different cultures came there because of the location of Sardinia in Mediterranean waters. So, you can imagine how many cultures influenced their cooking. The people are very friendly. We spent a lot of time at the beach and also at a confirmation for Julia's nephew, and that was a lot of fun because I got to try a lot of very interesting Sardinian dishes. This is looking pretty good. I don't think I need any more water. I'm going to take that out of the bowl now and just knead that on the board. Get rid of that. OK. So, that was about a cup of water thate add to the durum semolina. So, get it into a nice ball of dough and then you want to allow this to rest. You could also do this in a food processor [LAUGHTER] ifou dn't want to go through the trouble of doing it by hand. But you know, when you do things by hand like this, it puts you in touch again. It brings back memories and think about all those good times that you had. So, for me, doing it by hand is much more fun. So, that looks good. Now, we let this rest for about 30 min. Dough. We have dough, and we have dough that's ready, nice and soft. Look at that, two fingers, two eyes. It stays where it is, good. OKNow,hat neeto d worwithma pieces. You never want to use make things too tough, you you know. You see how soft that is? So, I'm going to just give it a few quick passes here. Look at how nice rol out And you can put this through a pasta . So, I have my trusty pasta machine set up right here with my trusty motor. That's not traditional, but you know what? It really helps in a kitchen when you're, when you're pressed for time and you don't wanna spend a lot of time. But guess what? I set it up. Now, I'm not even gonna use it. So, and then you have to have some kind of a round cutter. I li to e threinch one because that's what Mar- ah, Mario and Julia said was the right size. OK, it'skingorges. Look at how pretty that dough is. Just going to give a little bit re flour on the base h just to prevent this from sticking. OK, that's loong good because I can always-- almost see the board behind it. All right. Now, weeed cutt. So, you just- start cutting circles. You're going to need two per sebadas cause remember, this is going to be filled with- cheese, that beautiful fresh, young pecorino cheese that we flavored with orange zest and fresh mint leaves. So, I just put them on some parchment paper asLike that.g. Let's make a couple more just so you get the idea. Beautiful dough. You can do it. OK. All right. So, then we can roll more later on but I think you get the idea. OK, now, what we need to do is fill them. So, how does that go? Let me get the cheese. Here, we have cold solidified . Now obviously, we don't want to use that, we want to use something, excuse me, a little smaller like that. So, you do the same thing to the cheese. Yojustut o cires. It's a very unusual pastry. Once you have it like that and you take those circles of cheese anyoputthemighthere Pretty to look at, right? Just like that. Right in the cen. There's another one. How manyo I have? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. OK, I can do one more. Once you to havet li tha then you top it with another circle. Like that. Then, we're not done. Once you have them like that, then you want to use a little crimper and just go around the outside, okay? Like that, to seal them. You ta away that excess dough just like that. And now, that's sealed because we need e se becse wre gonna fry these. So let me do that again. Go round the outside with a little pasta wheel. It's a very pastoral kind of pastry because who would think of putting pecorino cheese into a pastry dough? I think this is really very classic. Oops, make sure that, that is sealed. OK. Orif y didt havene of those, you coulgorod is iless traditional with a little fork and seal the edges this way. I'm sure cooks in Sardinia do it however they want to, and you know what the-- the sad thing is that if it wasn't for Mario and Julia teaching me this recipe and now me passing it on to you, I think this is a type of recipe that will be lost to time because young people don't do this anymore. It's too time consuming and they're too busy. But, if you really cherish your heritage as they do, Julia and Mario, you would love to do and keep this tradition alive. So, there are our little Sebadas, one done with the wheel, the other three with a fork. So, now, we have to fry. In this pan, I have got olive oil. So, you need enough olive oil to do as many of the Sebadas that you're going to cook. So, you want to get that to about 375 degrees and we're gonna now put them in a couple at a time. So, I like to, you know, really watch this. So, I wanna put them in just a few at a time and allow them to get golden brown. So we can do-- we can do three in there. And it's really important that you have sealed those correctly otherwise they're all gonna open up. I've had that happen to me. They're all gonna open up and all that beautiful cheese is going to escape into the oil and you see how they're just lifting up to the top here in the oil and they're very light tasting. So, you know, we have to wait until they're golden brown and then we'll take them out. [MUSIC] Now we have fried the Sebadas and you see they're just golden brown. They're very warm and that's when you wanna eat them. They really should be eaten while they're warm. And how do they eat them in Sardinia? Well, with a little drizzle of honey over the top just like that because Sardinian honey is really, really delicious and there are many, many types. So, you drizzle honey over it, warm honey andn you sprinkle on some more of that orange zest over. And I suggest that you eat this with a fork and a knife. And when you doe been transpk to Sardinia and to a really classic and old-fashioned dessert. So, there you have it, Sebadas. Thank you, Mario and Julia. [MUSIC] Sometimes, it's good to keep traditions alive and respect them because they have a history and a story. And today, we made a classic dish from Sardinia. Sardinia called Sebadas. And remember, that was that pastry dough that we made with the durum semolina flour, a little bit of olive oil and salt, rolled out into circles and then filled with a young pecorino cheese. We friedd then we drim with a f honey and or. And until I see you Nella Cucina again, m Ma Ann Esposito. Ciao. [MUSIC] >>ary Ann ares the secrets W ss at Italiafood i? That's a misnomer because here we are in Rome and I'm just looking at the g for this . And look what they're offering. You've got tomatoes, grilled eggplant, grilled zucchini, grilled peppers, radicchio, beautiful, you've got pasta of course with mushrooms this one is in the back, you've got a mixed vegetable dish, and you've got stuffed peppers. And there, you have one of the classic vegetables of Rome. You can't come to Rome and not ha carofi, archokes. See them? Those are the artichokes that are marinated. But if you're in the Jewish section of Rome, then you wanna have the-- you wanna have those artichokes done Judea style, which means that the whole artichoke is fried and it looks like a beautiful crispy flower and you eat the whole thing. So, when I saw those I said, "Yes, definitely." A very Roman dish and beautiful vegetable dishes. Don't let anyone ever tell you that Italian regional food is fattening. Look at the wall of chili peppers. First used in a lot of different recipes here in, uh, southern Italy. I'm not even gonna translate the sign. [MUSIC] >> Funding for Ciao Italia was made possible by:
