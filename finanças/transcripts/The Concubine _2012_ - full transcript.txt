That is not what I meant Why do you frequent Deputy-Minister Shin's house? Because of his daughter? A mere deputy-minister's girl? I've never felt this way before The court is always critical of the king's half brother Stay away from her It is only right that I visit you often, stepmother You still call me stepmother, sire? I fret you come to keep watch on me Of course not With no son and not even a concubine They say I'm stopping you with ulterior motives It is only because I feel sorry to my late queen Though I am a stepmother, I have my courtly duties Then, please find a new queen for me I shall see to it immediately Who is it? Sir! Come in! Your Highness! How could you do this to me? Sir! It is late Let us go in and talk Did you not promise me? Yes, but how could I go against the court's orders, sir? Why?

Just roaming here and there, sire I'm ashamed to see you so weak and pale, sire I feel much better seeing you How are things outside? The grain and crops have fully ripened, sire Your people are making spirits with Chrysanthemums Recently, he's been ill quite often I'm afraid the court physician does not know why He'll regain his health soon Don't fret, Your Majesty You left so suddenly I was worried You worried about me? How foolish of me to worry you both I'm glad you've returned safely I came upon hearing His Majesty's ill I shall leave when he recovers It'd be a burden on you and my nephew for me to stay What burden? His Majesty welcomes you so I've taken up too much of your time, Your Majesty His Majesty appears blue and lifeless Someone is deliberately trying to assassinate him - Assassinate? How dare you? - Sirs! Let's calm down Let's listen to the court physician He's grown weak from boils and can't eat well Perhaps it's the food! If so, we must interrogate the royal kitchen matron! That's preposterous We can always do that after His Majesty recovers What do you mean? We must get to the truth behind His Majesty's illness His Majesty's state is critical Please come another day What do you mean? I am His Majesty's mother! Step aside Your Majesty! Why do you keep me from meeting my ailing son! I must see how he is at once! His Majesty must rest now Ask her to go for today Is the queen implying that I'd interfere in his health? - My acupuncture set! Hurry! - Yes, sir He isn't breathing! Don't just watch! Do something! This is a vital spot - Please appoint your successor! - Please, Your Majesty! Your Majesty! Your Majesty! Your Majesty! Your Majesty! Farewell, My King! Farewell, My King! Farewell, My King! Well done, Minister Yoon But the prince and queen are still alive The queen's father also has many followers How hard can a woman and her child be? Without the Left-State Minister and her father, she won't last We must push ahead before the Queen Mother She has the power to appoint the next king They are not to be messed with If you're ousted here, you and the prince will be in danger By the way This is the royal kitchen's log There's nothing around the day of the king's sudden illness That means... Yes. The matron who records the log is also missing She must be hidden away somewhere inside the palace Inside here? Yes We must find her and prove His Majesty was assassinated With proof, I can gather up forces with some ministers How dare you! They're conspirators of high treason! - Seize them! - Yes, sir! High treason? Why you! Have you no fear of heaven! There is a new heaven now! The queen's father is charged with treason! What? The Queen Mother has ordered his arrest for treason Fools! How dare you! Go away at once! Over there! Stop! Fools! This color was made with red sage in lye It must be soaked hundreds of times to get this bright, blood-like color It absorbs all other colors to shine even brighter It's the king's color Your Majesty! It's not our duty to take part in the court's affairs We look after His Majesty's necessities We maintain the court's order and customs We are invisible hands that keep the palace running We exist only for His Majesty and the royal court You must all remember and never forget that Yes, sir! It hasn't been long since His Majesty's been crowned Thus, the court eunuchs will also stand guard for a while If you fall, His Majesty is at risk! Stand and fight! Stand and fight! Who is that lad? Minister Yoon recommended him Minister Yoon? He'll be the new power here What do you mean? Don't feign innocence You're safe for now, but anything can happen If you want to stay here long, stay close to him Worried about your post? You must be getting old What's more important than that? I almost lost my life last time I trust you'll keep watching over me Your Majesty Lie to the left of the queen Your Majesty Lie over her with your heart to the left Lick and suckle her lips then swallow her saliva, sire Softly rub her lower stomach Then, caress down farther Wait until her breasts harden, then grasp them firmly, sire Your Majesty Begin intercourse, sire The queen must grab his waist and accept his royal penis I am ready, sire Let it in Go slowly, sire Next is the anal position Not yet, sire! You must ejaculate later to impregnate a son Please return to your chambers, sire If the Queen Mother knew... What happened? I couldn't say a word in the royal kitchen The maids run away when they see me We must find the royal kitchen matron Your Highness? You found something? Tell me Well, if she is still alive... I once heard the eunuchs whispering Past the Queen Mother's court and the laundry place I heard there is a secret pathway underground No sunlight can get through, But it snows all day there And only the Queen Mother's private soldiers know of it You wretch! Greet the late king's concubine at once! How dare you? Bring me a table of food and wine! His Majesty will come any moment What's taking so long? Why'd you come out? Let's return to your room Let's put some makeup on and change your clothes Why sure Your Highness! Your Highness! Your Highness! Please get me out of here I just did as I was told Calm down And take a look at this Did you write this? Yes, Your Highness But Do you remember what His Majesty ate that day? He had lunch at the Queen Mother's court The Queen Mother? She suddenly called His Majesty and ordered us not to prepare lunch Why? Is it not to your liking? It's because I have indigestion Afraid it's poisoned, sire? Of course not They say you are ill because I'm poisoning you Then, he had diarrhea all night You two dare defile the palace order? Make sure they never forget their sins! Cut off the atrocious fool's penis! Remove her womb and sew her genitals! Show them the strict order of the court! Yes, ma'am! You have such soft hands I know, sir Your Majesty Who are you? Please kill me. I mean, no! I asked who you are I deserve to die She is Her Highness' maid from home Please forgive me, sire What brings you to this humble sire? I haven't visited since you moved to this place Where did you go at night with no guards? My father is locked up How could I just sit and wait? I apologize I've been too busy with things You must be devastated I shall see to your father's release I cannot be a burden on you, sire I am just grateful to be alive It must be uncomfortable in this old place Chief Eunuch! Furnish this place suited to Her Highness That is under jurisdiction of the Queen Mother, sire What? It's her jurisdiction? So, you won't follow the king's order? Your Highness! Look at this! His Majesty sent such nice things This way! Embankment work on Nakdong River damaged tributary The peasant shares in great harm With the rainy season 320 homes were lost And over 200 people went missing Apart from what's required, reduce the taxes Order all district magistrates to send soldiers to help the people Next is a list of pardoned sinners in honor of the coronation Excluding murders and high treason 280 sinners in the capital and 137 elsewhere were... Do you people not see me? Why don't you submit reports to me? While His Majesty learns affairs, the Queen Mother is... Does it look like I'm learning by just sitting here? From now on, prepare reports for him to see as well Continue Is the queen's father on the list? Have you lost your mind? Do you not know for whom they are being purged? The former queen's father has many followers I fret it'll perturb the people You kept watch on me? Though you act as regent, I am still the king You're not ready Mentioning personal feelings at court is no king! Forgotten how we made it here? If we don't nip the bud, we could get hurt again We almost died when your court was on fire I've never once forgotten that Please stop mentioning that Every woman in the palace is yours, but one! You can never touch that woman Bring all the eunuchs at the former queen's court! What have I done wrong? I did all you wanted, Mother I accepted her as sister-in-law And became the king as you wished! What more do you want from me? If the bee will not shoo away the flower will be cut off Get me a drink Hwayeon! Hwayeon! I took you in like my own son How dare you covet my daughter! Hwayeon!

You're the only one I have in the palace Kwonyoo How could you? How could I be of any help now? What more do you want in life? If you want to live, run away alone Alone again Like before Run by yourself No visitors are allowed Still, Her Highness is here Just for a moment? I could lose my head I'm sorry Could you at least give this to my elderly father? It's rice gruel Your daughter sent this You? How did you come here? Such a dangerous act My daughter is innocent I heard what happened from the royal kitchen matron Who should I tell this to? Look. I'll die for my sin But not her! You should've killed me back then Stop! Come back! How is the former queen? She is well, Your Majesty Visit her day and night to make sure she's well Yes, sire How dare you? Persimmon is harmful to His Majesty's boils What is your name? Choongyoung, sire How'd you know I have boils? I knew from how you hesitated leaning against your back Tell me, how can boils be subdued? Sweat and chills can cause boils to form easily, sire It is best to avoid raw or cold foods You seem familiar Have we met before? No, sire. How can a lowly man meet His Majesty? I like this lad Promote him as senior eunuch Your Majesty To become a senior, one must work over 16 years It took him over 20 years to reach that post to be here - This man came in recently - What? Can't I do as I wish even with a eunuch? Why? Do you only follow the Queen Mother, too? As you wish, sire What brings Your Highness here this late? Is it this? Kwonyoo They will be beheaded at dawn Why make the effort? The poor kitchen matron died because of you Madam? What is it? I must watch my father die for we couldn't die with the king Please kill us first, sire Beheading the former queen's father is too harsh Please take back the order The court has already decided Please save her father! I will do whatever you want I will no longer seek her! Loyal ministers wish this to stabilize your reign! No further discussion Who do you speak of? The relatives on your side who all hold posts? She must suffer so because the late king didn't kill us? Watch what you say! Am I this nation's king at all? Not this time It won't be as you wish Sire! - Chief Eunuch? - Yes, sire Run and stop the execution Changing the Queen Mother's order will... Then, you go! No judgments That is not up to us All hear His Majesty's command! Shin Ik-chul and his men have plotted high treason And endangered the court By law, their entire family must die and... Wretched fool! You poisoned the late king to death! Off with his head! Step aside! I must speak with her! Your Majesty Sire! Please calm down Why you! Perhaps it's best to go, sire There. Checkmate Let me see Oh no. Take back just one move? Again? Nothing comes for free I have nothing but my balls Want that? Testicles? Why sure! I've been dying for them I'll take back 10 moves! Why look like you just stepped in shit? How is the game? I always win, but it's not fun Why? Trouble in the court? 30 years here, I thought I knew it inside out But I'm still not sure of what is right or wrong Why you It's hard to tell who is right because everyone is right When I cut off my balls to come here I sealed off reasoning, too It's not about right or wrong Just having power or not here Wait Did I just say that? Not bad, aren't I? Yes. Indeed What would you have become instead of a eunuch? Just leading a happy life with a wife and kids Forget it Unless we die, we can't ever leave here You fool! Testing to see if my eyes will pop out or not? I can't stand him! KING It is obvious for whom they plotted treason Depose the former queen and banish her and her son Your Majesty Please punish the former queen to avoid any future harm Our king isn't coming again? Your Majesty Please give the order Please give the order! Find reason against her to persuade the king first! Dismissed Your Majesty Please depose and banish them Call the Chief Minister Why not look at me? I am embarrassed to see you without your proper robes, sire This is embarrassing? You who clearly show ulterior motives is far more shameless I'll ask one thing What trait is most important to be king? Showing virtue with humanity, sire Then, what is the root of humanity? Compassion, sire Is banishing a widow compassion? - Is that a virtuous deed? - But, sire You can kill us all, but think of the court and... Old fool! Do you think the Queen Mother's regency will last forever? Take the others and go Or you'll get your wish to die! Go away at once! His Majesty has arrived Stay here Please return during the day, sire I heard you are ill With my father's head up on the street, how can I be well? Is that why you avoid me so? Do you know what is happening in the court? I know very well, sire Those dying to banish me will be avid to find you here So please Do not come for me again How can you be so cruel? Why do you think I endure being on the throne? For what? Why put me in such misery? Yell at me instead For stealing my nephew's seat and letting your father die! Say you are angry! Say it!

If you want to live If you want to leave the palace I shall find a way Why? Am I next? Do you know where I just came from? I saw your father's head hung in the street Does she resent me greatly? She is torn by the loss She cannot eat She is devastated Go on How does she look before sleeping? Pardon? Well, she changes her clothes She unties her hair And sleeps in a white dress Who undresses her? I do, sire How do you undress her? Well, I untie the breast-tie - Do you bathe her, too? - Yes, sire How do you bathe her? She goes into a scented hot tub Where do you wash her first? With a fine cloth I wash her breasts and shoulders Is she soft? Yes, she is so soft and white Go on When she gets up, I wash between her legs Your Majesty This is your new room, madam You've gained His Majesty's favor, but have yet to be a concubine Please mind your conduct and do not wander from this room Yes, ma'am I see She will be your maid Madam Is there anything you need? - No. You may go - Yes, ma'am Go away at once! Servants! Thank you, Your Majesty Oh, Your Majesty Geum-ok! Having fun, sir? What a strange world I became a royal concubine And you became a eunuch Interesting, isn't it? His Majesty is here We're just in time They are not to be disturbed You became a senior eunuch? Will you help in His Majesty coming to my court? Remember our ties from outside the palace? I've forgotten all that happened outside You must help me to keep your secrets You've gone high enough Watch your tongue to avoid bringing harm upon yourself Your Majesty How I upset you not knowing the great pains I've caused No, madam I, too, have been upset over what happened to your father What harm does the Queen Mother think my son and I could be? Madam Forgive me about your father How could I blame you, sire? I must not be fit to be king What do you mean, sire? The late king always said you had the wisdom and morals Why the Queen Mother's regency? What a shame and a pity It's time you gave orders to depose them, Your Majesty Deposing her is not the only way Pardon? Who would seek the truth if she fell prey to a mishap? Don't mind her She's survived in the palace for over 30 years Do you know why she has but one ear? She heard something she should not She is wise She knows to go along with the tide He visited the former queen? Do you know anything about poison? I once saw poisonous aconite while with ginseng diggers - Having this inside the palace... - Means trouble But to those who don't know, it's just a rook Know how to make poison with that? - By burning it, sir - Then, make it If the mother and son won't leave, there's only one way out of here You deal with where His Majesty sleeps? Me? I wouldn't dare Could you lead him to me on the 3rd? - Please, madam - Who knows? If I give birth to a prince, you'll be the chief eunuch No use for the libido I get from eating frogs Excuse me 30 years here, I can tell why you came Let's see if you're fit to bear a son Just examining Don't get excited - I need something that works well - Sure - Got different sized breasts? - No! Your medicine depends on that It'll be harder to have sons - They're different, right? - No Let me take a look I'll have to feel them to be sure They're the same! That's good This'll go in Is this for a son? Turn a girl into a boy before birth Decoct it and drink it the day before The day before Wait This is the son She took the daughter People are so cunning When you go up, you don't want to get down Right, Your Highness? With His Majesty's favor, who says I can't become a queen? How dare you! Watch your words, madam You dare tell me what to do? With the king's favor who would I help? Would I do anything to harm you? Of course How can I help? I should adorn myself to catch his eye I need jewelry Take whatever you think you'll need When you give birth to a crown prince I'll build a temple somewhere and pray there for life I'm ashamed for being unable to give birth to a son His Majesty sent word he is in pain and will not sleep here Does he know it's the most auspicious day in 4 years? Yes, Your Majesty Let's go. My son is ill, I must see him Have you learned the traits of a king? It's okay. Tell me Yes, sire It's wisdom, virtue, and honor Good What does wisdom mean? It means having open eyes and ears The eyes must foresee things The ears must listen to the people Good That is correct Here Sire? The decoction is getting cold I must be nothing more than a breeding pig Of course not, sire How can having an heir be taken lightly? Quiet! You drink it It would've been better if you were king Sire. The Queen Mother has arrived What are you doing! I am not only your son, but the king What king? When you don't come to the assemblies! You don't give me a chance to do anything You make all the decisions Now, you want me to be a puppet? When things settle and you have an heir, I will step down When will that be? What? Why don't you just sit on the throne, Mother? I am sick of sleeping with the queen before you! I just have to sow the seeds? It doesn't have to be the queen An auspicious day?

Do you detest me that much? Am I... no better than that eunuch? Drag him in He seemed familiar He was the fool who lived in your house! You disguised him as a eunuch? - That's preposterous - Explain yourself! Why is that fool here! I didn't know he was here until recently, Your Majesty You expect me to believe that? I remember how he used to look at you! You and that fool! Who's the father of your prematurely born son? Is he my brother's son or not? Undress him I must see if he is a eunuch or not! Must you humiliate me like this? Strip him! Sire. Why would you see something so hideous? Please leave, sire Madam! Don't you know how I feel? Do you really think I don't know?

What do you want me to do? Hwayeon Sire You shot 40 times Think of... You called, Your Majesty? Shoot!

He still suspects it We can't keep staying here Sire, please... Sire! What is it, sire? Sire Kwonyoo? Where is he? Call Choongyoung I'm not drinking that decoction again But, Your Majesty The Queen Mother makes sure you drink this every day Then, you drink it Pardon?

The king has charged you! Fool! How dare you come here like that? What's going on? Minister Yoon is charged with treason Treason? Go away at once! I apologize, but the king ordered to imprison him at once The king's order? Who put you in that position? You dare raise your sword? You dare raise a sword at me? I'll go to the king Go to the dungeon and kill her! The chief eunuch has arrived, sire Sire! Where are you? I know you are here! Come out here! Sitting up here I can see why you were so attached to it What are you doing there? Why did you order Minister Yoon's arrest? You sent away the soldiers I sent? How can you send soldiers to your mother? I must really be a puppet king You liked that seat so much, you cut me up into a puppet Now, you'll get rid of me? What do you mean? Did you give the order to poison me? What? The physician confessed You plotted with Yoon to kill me? What? - That's preposterous! - Isn't it? I thought it was strange Your man, Yoon, couldn't have plotted this alone! This is a trap! The former queen is up to this That wretch! Right. Now, I see Poison the decoction than frame her?

The late king couldn't have children Be honest for once! Have you forgotten? The late queen died while giving birth! I poisoned him since - The prince's birth is dubious - What? You poisoned my brother? Who asked you to do that? For whom! For whom did you do that! When did I ever say I wanted to be king? When did I ever say I wanted to be king! My child... Look at me It was all to protect you in this cruel palace I'm your mother Why'd you force me on the throne and turn me into someone who can't trust his mother? You can't trust me? You dare defy your mother! If you all meet, the truth will come out Guards! Bring Minister Yoon and Kwonyoo at once! That won't happen! Yes, it will! Minister Yoon! I brought the criminals as ordered, Your Majesty The physician confessed Evidence was found in his room Who do you think he said was behind this? How would I know, sire? Why can't you say it!

You knew! How'd you know it was poisoned? Sire! Do you know what she did? She defiled the royal court with that fool! Drag her here to confess! Yes! I'm guilty Guilty for bearing the late king's son And guilty for being alive You're guilty for this uproar due to your son And guilty for distracting the king! But, Your Majesty Who is that man? He's Minister Yoon's man who killed my father What daughter would secretly plot with the enemy? You wretch! How dare you show fake tears here! What would my young child know or do that I'd covet your throne? If I thought that in the slightest I'd bite my tongue and die right here But I cannot die falsely accused as someone so shameless Confess the truth! Who ordered you to poison the decoction? The Queen Mother She ordered me to make the poison And Minister Yoon gave it to... This is a trap! It's a trap, sire! What are you doing? Why did you do it!
