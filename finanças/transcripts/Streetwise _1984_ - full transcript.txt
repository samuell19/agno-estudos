I think it's a funeral There was his father There were guards prison guards because of his dad's status three other people All three who've worked With Dwayne in one way or another as part of social service agencies, and that was it So it was pretty much as his life has been it was a pretty lonely pretty skimpy affair Over in our lives we are often confused and we often ask why But it is times like these when ry becomes our strongest cry Your girlfriend have a house or car or something have a little money in the banking job that's why I suspect all of it Not much Let me sir But I'll see My understanding Twain will be cremated and his ashes spread out on Puget Sound Twain was us a streak hit join drifted all his life and It it seemed better for me than just putting him out all on the ground in a box where he's gotta be there He's free he's never been that way before Because you're tired little teddy bear Much for Arturo Together No You got Oh You know Running More than a million young people running means surviving and surviving on the streets is the most hellish risk a runaway kid can take With your help we can reduce this risk.
