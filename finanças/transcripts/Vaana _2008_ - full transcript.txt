When I was in army I was coming home by train.. ..from delhi for my holidays. Bharati and your mom.. ..along with their friends were traveling in the same coach. The train was traeling at 100km/hr speed. When I saw Bharati my heart started traeling.. ..at 150km/hr speed. I don't know how your mom noticed.. ..the speed of our love, but when we reached a station.. ..she got us down there and took us to a temple.. ..and got us married and from the same station.. ..she dispatched us to delhi. It was rainy season, young man. You too take a quick decision like my mom did. I will stop the car if I see a temple.. ..and you get both of us married. We would also get married in rainy season. daddy, what's this! You aren't saying him anything.. ..even after whateer he said. - We still hae some time. do not worry. - You want him to scold me? He is a fool and he doesn't know that you are also a fool. it won't be of any use. At most he could hear me. I don't fear him at all. Listen, uncle, if i would take your daughter to Hyderabad.. ..father a few kids and admit them in school.. ..would you have a problem? Thanks, uncle. A while ago I called you a fool. You are a great guy. - daddy, hae you gone mad? What happened to you? He talks in such a cheap way.. ..and you are listening to him silently? What happened to you, daddy?

Your mom's husband. - Father. You called me father, you scoundrel? Rascal. You're the one who begs from the beggars at the temple. You're the one who trains new beggars. You're the one who reuses others' used condoms. You're the one whose print-out can't be got in a XeroX. You're the Virus in computers. You're the one who sells pirated Cds in Maldies. You're the cheap one who steals goods from.. ..tsunami affected places and sell them in second market. You're an ugly fellow. You jump out of the room.. ..when your wife enters the room. - How did you find it out? Shut up! You are the link between Bin Laden and Bush. I didn't understand the last one. Say it again. Never. I don't use a curse word again. Hang up the phone. I need to pee. - I too feel the same. ''Look they are beating the drums.'' ''It's festie season here.'' ''Sing and dance..''

To police station? - No, to the railway station. I need to receive my friends. - Your friends are my friends. Come on. i will also come with you. - You can't. I will. - You can't. I will. - You can't. ok, fine, I won't. - You can't. Thanks, let's go. You can't. You can't. You can't. You should go now. The station is not nearby. It's 150 km away. - Come on. Wash them properly. Lazy fellows! No one works properly here except uncle. do it fast. - Hello, man ! Hello! What happen? Look at the flooring, uncle. Tomorrow the groom would see Nandini.. ..as soon as he gets down the can. He would run towards her and trip on this floor. If it's me who trips it's fine. Uncle, I am here to bear all these things, right? What's wrong with him! ln Hyderabad he doesn't even.. ..wash his coffee cup and here he is behaving.. ..like such a nice guy means he must'e definitely.. ..liked something here. Let's go. You should learn from him how to clean the floor. Yes, sir. - devdas, she looks very angry. You fool, look how that young man is doing. Mani, take out the car. - dear, when you are going.. ..on those roads you shouldn't travel fast. You should drive carefully. What happened, Mani, you tripped down? Just like that, sir. - did you hurt your waist? Can you drive? - Can you at least get up? daddy, I will drive it myself. Nandini. Stop there, girl. Uncle, please don't ask me to go with her. Abhi, she's about to get married. She shouldn't be going there alone. The roads are not fine and the drier is also not there. You go along with her. Please. ok, uncle. But only you are saying it. Just for you. I am going there just for you. Nandini. i will change my dress, ok? My foot. - Thank you. - That's good. What happened, buddy? Why are you so dull? You shouldn't take eerything to heart. don't get tensed. I am here with you. Stop the car. Stop the car. Yes, stopped it. Now what? Get down. Get down. She wants me to get down. Even if it's raining the queen ordered me to get down. I got into the car only because of my father. Shut your mouth and drie the car or else i will go my way. Got it? - Hello! I didn't say anything to you. This devdas was sad and I asked him how he is. He said that police were searching for the culprit.. ..after the elephant was raped in the forest. And I asked him why he was scared.. ..If police is searching someone. He said that they doubt him. Shut up! You are just four feet tall.. ..and she is as high as a building. I asked him how they would doubt him. He said that his name is already there.. ..in the police records on the charges of raping a girl. Wow! devdas, she smiled at us means the gates.. ..of her heart are open and that we would get an entry. Hey, you are sleeping? Encourage me, buddy. Coming. Coming. What were you two discussing about? He is a player. You know what he said? Since she is laughing take her to Hyderabad. You know what I said then? I said that it's wrong to talk like that. She would get upset. Am I right or wrong? - Yes, you're right. Shall we go now? Be careful. He's already tensed. He might even bite you. He's a rascal. Nothing like that would happen. He has become my friend as well. He won't talk to you from now onwards. Hey, you said you won't talk to me? Give him to me. No, I won't. He is upset with you. - Why? He said that he learnt only bad things from you.. ..and wants me to teach him some good things. - Really? Go and find out when the train would come. Go. Sir, when would the train from delhi come? What shall I tell you? - Tell me when it would come. It would stop at innumerable places in this rain.. ..and then people hae to get into it.. ..and the jam on tracks.. - Sir, sir.. You need not stretch it, sir. Just tell me how late it will be. Five minutes? - Five hours. Five hours, sir? - Why are you so surprised? is this the first time you are boarding a train? Sir, I never met a sweet person like you till now. Thank you, sir. Thank you very much. Thank you. devdas, we got five hours now. Without wasting a second we'll have to spend.. ..a good time with her, ok? Stay with me only if you say 'yes'. or else go to some place and die. I called home to tell them that we would be late. There's a famous temple nearby. daddy asked me to isit the temple. Shall we go? If you ask me i am ready to come not just to temple.. ..but i would een come to primary school. Shall we go now? o sorry! devdas. devdas. devdas. Look at him. Look at his mischief. I told him to get lost to somewhere and die.. ..and he is sitting right in the middle of the track. Train. devdas. Hey, if you do such a thing again i will kill you. I didn't run so fast een when i was had to pee.. ..and you made me run so fast on the track? don't say a word. Shut up! Hey, will you stop this crap? i am bored of it. - ok. How can you shut your mouth just like that! If you don't retort with some witty line.. ..it's an insult to your tongue. Say something. O God! When I say something you ask me to stay quiet.. ..and when i am quiet you ask me to say something? You ask people liing in peace to die and ask.. ..a dying person to lie. Why did you make women.. ..so difficult to understand, God? Earlier I used to get mad at you when you used to talk. Now I feel like laughing. - So I look like a joker? You look like that, but are very emotional. You got ready to sacrifice your life for after all a hare. You are really great. I underestimated you a great deal. I am very sorry. Even God doesn't know when these girls would say sorry.. ..when they would laugh and when they would get angry. You know God created something else.. ..after creating women. You know what it is? Sandals to fight. What's this joke! We carry old people.. ..or physically handicapped to temples, but they are carrying.. ..young and healthy people. And what would they do after reaching the top? They would throw them from the top? Had I known that I would'e brought my father.. don't talk about Mother Ammaaru.. ..without knowing fully about her. if we carry the people we loe to the top.. ..and worship for them they would live happily ever after. I see. So we should carry the people we like to the top.. ..and worship for them they would lie happily ever after? Right? - Absolutely correct! Then do one thing. You carry me to the top.. ..and i would lie happily. - Eerything's a joke for you. You stay here and I will go there.. ..and worship Mother and bring holy offering. Hey, Nandini! Stop there. Wait a minute. - What? You know something? Before climbing the stairs.. ..we should close our eyes and pray Mother once. Then we would get double the blessings.. ..and double the rewards. - You are right for the first time. Thanks. daddy. - dear. daddy. daddy. - dear. - What happened, daddy? What happened, dear? - My head is spinning. I can't take it anymore. i think i am getting older. Why do you worry, daddy? You're the one who carry me every year, right? I wanted to carry you to the top of the temple till my last day. But I think God doesn't want that. What are you saying! She would walk this year. No, I didn't want to make my daughter walk. Alright. We are planning to get her married next year. Then her husband would carry her, ok? Correct. it's her husband who would.. ..carry my daughter after me. devdasu, we got five lovely hours.. ..and she is wasting time looking at water. isn't it wrong? Hey, you seem are upset regarding something. Hey, it's overflowing. Fie minutes ago there was no water at all. did you fill it with your tears? Why did you carry me at the temple? - So that's the matter? You said that if your loved ones carry you.. ..to the top of the temple your life would be beautiful. That's the reason I carried you to the top and worshipped lord. Why are you behaing like a cancer-stricken heroine.. ..in old moies for such a simple thing? Hey, please! Please leave me alone. Please go. ok. Sorry. Sorry. Cool. devdasu, all the times you used to ring the bell.. ..and warn me. Why didn't you warn me when i carried her? Now look how angry she is. it's really difficult to understand women. it's raining. We are getting drenched. Hey, come on ! Come on ! Yes, both of you. Yes, come fast. - it's raining heaily. if you fall ill your father would shoot me with his rifle. He has got a superb aim. Come on, let's go. Come on ! Come in. Come in. You are completely drenched. Go inside and wear a sari. Wipe your head or else you will get feer. Come in. Come in. wear my sari. Poor girl! - Grandpa, hae some mercy upon me as well. I am also drenched in rain. - Come here, kid. Come here. Sit down. I hae got some medicine.. ..to you feel you away from feer. Will you hae it? Take it. No, thanks, grandpa. - Wait, I will wipe your head. No, grandpa, I am a ery good guy. You won't get spoilt if you drink this. It's alright. No, grandpa. No. I can't drink it. - It's alright. Hae it, kid. Wear this sari, dear. How do I wear this sari? We illiterates are better than you educated people. Come, dear. I will drape it. You are saying no, but if you hae a couple of pegs.. ..you won't feel cold anymore. Have it, son. - What's this, grandpa! All the people I come across are drunkards. I wonder why people drink. - o God! We didn't ask God to gie us food, right? He is giving us food and we are eating it. This is also the same. Have it, son. - No, grandpa. We don't have milk here. it's black coffee. Give this cup to that boy. Go, dear. I too saw my lady in a similar sari when we were young.. ..and went crazy about her. i wonder what would happen to you. He seems to be a silent killer. ''i think it's moonlight standing in front of me.'' ''She is playing with my innocent heart.'' ''I am completely lost.'' ''My heart is not with me.'' ''I am swinging in the melody of the rain.'' ''I think it's moonlight..'' ''How do I catch this dream that looks so real?'' ''How do control my joy it if this dream comes true?'' ''My silence is wondering if it would come true or not.'' ''I wonder if you are a statue or you are my beloed one.'' ''i hae become your prisoner for life.'' ''I think it's moonlight..'' ''Where is my heart wondering when it didn't reach you?'' ''My pleas are fed up as there are no listeners.'' ''I wonder if my heart would reach its destination.'' ''I wonder if I would get my loe.'' ''This is a curse that looks like a boon.'' ''I think it's moonlight standing in front of me.'' ''She is playing with my innocent heart.'' ''I am completely lost.'' ''My heart is not with me.'' ''I am swinging in the melody of the rain.'' ''i think it's moonlight..'' You look beautiful in drunken state. - I am not drunk. Not you, I am drunk. - ok, let's go now. Time's passing by. Time? Time is a cheat. When I saw you I thought my time turned great. I thought there would come a time.. ..when you would fall in loe with me. I thought there would come a time.. ..I would marry you and hae a dozen kids. it didn't come. i thought there would come a time.. ..when you hug me tight and say.. ..that you loe me the most in this world. It didn't come. Whom should I scold? Him? Poor God! What has he done wrong? He sent me into a rich family. Why? I could also hae loed mone y like my father does. Why did I fall in loe with you? ok, I fell in loe with you. What happened? I fell flat when I saw you. God warned us against falling in the pit called loe. I should'e heard Him, but l didn't. Still I searched it. It appears and disappears at once. It appears and disappears at once. Without een coming into my dream God told me.. Hey, idiot! This girl would appear and disappear.. ..from your life at once like a lightning.. ..but won't be in your house like a candle. Whose fault is it? Mine. What should I do? Forget her. I should forget her. Go ahead. Get married. Lead a happy married life. Start a family. But let me tell you one thing.. ..no one would loe you in this world as much as i loe you. No matter whereer you are, howeer you are.. ..een if you forget me, een if you become old.. ..een if you die my loe for you won't die. It's empty. But it's not empty here. Your smile, your beauty, your blushing, your luster.. ..the sound of your anklets, this rain, that watch.. ..the sound of that rascal dedas' bell.. ..eerything together hae gien me incurable wound.. l will surie. i will still surie. These couple of days I spent with you are enough for me. I will spend the rest of my life with those memories. dedas, come on, we are getting late. No, thanks. - Abhi. - No, thanks. You gae me your hand once and I am suffering this much. I wonder what would happen if you gie me your hand again. You are holding the umbrella for someone.. ..who is completely drenched. No, thanks. No, girl. No. Let me get drenched in this rain. Let me get drenched in this rain. Let me get drenched in this rain. ''Something's chasing me.'' ''Some unknown pain.'' ''It's demanding answers from me..'' ''..for a fault I haven't done..'' ''..from the intoxicated heart.'' ''Some unknown beautiful pain..'' ''..that isn't isible.'' ''Something's chasing me.'' We thought you would come to receive us.. ..but we are receiving you in turn. - Let's go. Excuse me! What young man ! Why are you so dull? - It's nothing, uncle. Listen there are a lot of my daughter's friends. You can impress one of them, can't you? I went after just one girl and the brakes failed.. ..and the vehicle overturned, uncle. one more in the gap? It's tough. If you want the vehicle of your love to come back on track.. ..take your girl to Mother's temple nearby. Things will get fine. - Really, uncle? definitely. I heard that you went there today. And that Nandini couldn't climb the stairs.. ..and that you brought the holy offering for her. did she say so, uncle? - It didn't happen? No, that's what happened. - Good. Last time when we went to that temple.. ..my blood pressure raised and i stopped midway. That's why that day I prayed Goddess.. ..that henceforth her husband should carry her to the top. Really, uncle? - Yes. From this year onwards her husband.. ..will carry her to the top. My prediction neer goes wrong. Uncle, you'll hae to distribute the cards. - Coming. Yes. devdas, did you hear that? My hard-work didn't go waste. God has mercy upon me.. ..for carrying a 55 kg girl to the top of the temple. It's working out. Now I am Nandini's husband, at least 50%. Hey, dedas, why do you ring the bell around your neck.. ..to prove that whateer I want never comes true? I am going to.. - Hey, stop! Stop! Stop! Yes, ladies. See her well. This is the dress your daughter.. ..would be wearing for her wedding. See if we adorned her fine. don't find faults afterwards. Superb. Wonderful. But something's missing. Missing? - He is impossible. We shouldn't have shown her to him in the first place. Young man, you tell me what it is. Can you think of anything? Yes, I will, uncle. When vermilion is not there on forehead she looks.. ..like a demon and when she puts vermilion there.. ..she looks like a goddess. - That's it. How could you forget vermilion, ladies! Such an important thing! Go, dear. Go and put the dot on your forehead. Uma, your son is not an ordinary guy. Een though we What's the matter? What happened? Nandini is behaving strangely since morning. She shut her door and is not talking to anyone. I will take care of her. Come. What, dear? - What's the matter, dear? What happened? You shouldn't throw your wedding sari in this way. What happened, dear? - did anyone say anything to you? Hey, bring the gun. - Calm down. You solve every problem with your gun. You are upset because you have to go to delhi.. ..after marriage, right? - is that so, girl? No regrets. Gautam will be with you in delhi. You will completely forget us then. Every girl has to go through this pain.. ..before going to in-laws' place, dear. Get up. If you sit with such a long face.. ..they would think you are against this marriage. Your mother says just anything. Just ignore her. Get up. Come on. - devdas. devdas. Hi, uncle! What's the matter? What's going on? Sorry, uncle. I didn't know there's a family meeting.. ..going on over here. I was just searching for dedas. Young man, you are also our family member. Come here. Come here. My daughter mood is totally off. Bring her back into mood. - Me? Yes, son. Make her laugh. So you think I am a joker, a buffoon. No, that's not the thing. - Why should we make her laugh? Even these girls don't know when and why.. ..they would become upset. - Correct. Shall I sing a pathos song as per the situation? No singing. Singing cancelled. What shall I do? I see. So that's the reason for all this trouble? I see. So you are here? devdas, the girl I wanted to take away from here.. ..is about to leave from the main door in a couple of days. These shortcuts are not useful for anything. I will untie it. - Stop. don't untie it. Let it be there. I didn't get it. There is no need for me to get it. This is the first time I am so confused in my life. It's all because of you. ''o beautiful rain, how far will this breeze go?'' ''o beautiful rain !'' ''You increase my pain and make me shed tears.'' ''or you would make me shed tears of joy?'' ''You don't know where your destination is.'' ''o beautiful rain, how far will this breeze go?'' ''o beautiful rain !'' Cheers for the health of the beauty! 60. - 50. - 100. 70. - 80. - 100. - 100? What's wrong with them? Are they giing them marks or are they flirting with girls?

It's time to realize your dreams. did you forget it? My marriage is there in two days. I am planning to cancel this wedding. Now don't tell me the same old story that you will convince.. ..everyone and if they aren't convinced we would elope. Eloping before one's marriage is not that easy. Try to understand. ok, madam. ok. Hello! Hello! - People in this house don't sleep.. ..even at night? Someone is knocking my doors. Is that so? - Hang up the phone. I'll call you later. What's the matter, auntie? Come here. Sit down. Who is he? Who, auntie? - The guy who loves Nandini. Tell me the truth. You know everything. She is about to get married to Gautam in two days.. ..and now she says she loes someone.. ..and that she would elope with him. Who told you so, aunt? - I heard it. I heard her saying that on phone. She is planning to cancel this wedding.. ..and elope with someone. - There's nothing like that, aunt. You must'e heard it wrong. - don't support her. Abhi, if your marriage doesn't take place.. ..our family, our reputation, everything will be destroyed. Abhi, Nandini doesn't befriend anyone so easily. She doesn't trust anyone. She moves very closely with you. That's why she must'e told you who he is. Who is he? It's me, auntie. Abhi, it's not the time to crack jokes. Try to understand a mother's problem. Find it out from her who that guy is. Try to change her mind. Please make sure that she doesn't do anything stupid.. ..and marries Gautam. our family's reputation is in your hands. Please do something, Abhi. Please. Thank you. Thank you. Hello, Gautam! How are you? We all are waiting for you. Come safely. Wish you a safe journey. Bharati, the groom has left his place along with his friends. He would be here tomorrow by this time. - Alright. What? Sir looks very happy today. Why do you look upset, son? Because you couldn't see her? I saw her? - You saw her? Who is that girl? Where does she lie? She lies here itself. You know her. I know her? Who is she? Nandini. Nandini? - Yes, mom. Nandini also likes me. She is even ready to elope with me. Mom, don't ask me to step back. Nandini is my life. I neer raised my hand on you even to scare you. But today I slapped you. It's not my fault, mom. I fell in loe with Nandini even before.. ..I knew her marriage was fixed. - don't say a word. You know what our position is in this house? They gave me the first wedding initation. When I told them that our tradition to keep the first.. ..wedding card in front of lord's idol you know what they said? They said I am their Goddess. How can we betray people who respect us so much ! Loving someone is wrong, mother? Loving someone is not wrong. But you are saying that you would elope with a girl.. ..who is about to get married in two days. That is wrong. That is what is wrong. We came to the marriage. We shall leave after blessings the couple. don't ruin their lies. Forget Nandini. Loing someone is not great. Sacrificing is great. Keep it in mind. Abhi. Abhi, I am ery tensed. I am scared as well. do something. Please, Abhi. Please do something. What's the need to get scared? Am I not there? I will talk directly to your father. That's the only way left. - And what if he doesn't agree? I will convince him. I will beg, I will touch his feet.. I will do whatever it takes. ok? Abhi. What happened, Abhi? did you talk to her? Auntie, you don't worry at all. Everything will be fine. Hey, the wedding is nearing. At least now work properly. Go away. Go away. Good morning, sir. - Good morning. Salute to the retired Indian Army colonel. You are priests? - We salute the retired lndian Army colonel. And the chants? We have memories eight epics, four Vedas and the panishads.. I didn't understand anything. That must be Sanskrit. Please go inside. - Come. Please come. Uncle, shall we go to jogging? It's been a year since I gave up jogging. How can you give up jogging after being a military officer? If you want to get relieved of tension.. ..you should go to jogging. Come on. Is that so? - Yes, come on. - ok, let's go. Young man. - Yes, uncle. Stop, buddy. I can't jog anymore. I feel tired. - What are you saying, uncle! You shouldn't be talking like that. You are a military officer. You are ery strong, uncle. Uncle, actually I fixed this program.. ..as I wanted to talk to you about something. Is that machine working, uncle? I can hear you. Tell me. After I tell you this you will have to accept it, uncle. I am.. I am in love with Nandini, uncle. Please get me married to Nandini. don't say no, uncle. Please, uncle. Uncle. Uncle! Uncle. Uncle. Uncle. Uncle. Uncle. Uncle. Uncle. What happened, uncle? Uncle. Uncle. Uncle. Uncle. What happened, uncle? Uncle. What happened, uncle? No. don't give a call to home. Call the doctor. Come on. This happened a number of times with me. There was no one with me then. You are there with me now. You look so healthy. How can you hae a problem, uncle? You think a military man like me cannot have a problem? You know something? death is a great equalizer. It doesn't discriminate between the rich and poor. And I have my death in my doorstep. I might die any moment. Hey, what rubbish are you talking.. ..when there is a wedding in your house in two days? Hey, I told my friends something.. ..that I didn't even tell my wife and kids. He became a close friend of mine in a short time. He must also know it. When I was on border our camp was attacked suddenly. Three bullets struck my body. When I opened my eyes I was in the hospital. They took out two bullets. The third bullet was left next to my heart. They said my life would be in danger if they try to take it out. I am counting my last days with a bullet next to my heart. I cannot forget the soldier who didn't leave me behind.. ..when I was dying and took me to the hospital. You know who he is? He is Nandini's would-be husband. His name is Gautam. I am not making him my son-in-law as he saved my life. He is a great soldier who saved his fellow soldier.. ..for the country. That's why I am making him my son-in-law. Young man, come here. Is my decision the correct decision? What? It's correct, uncle. And yes, you were about to say something.. ..a while ago, right? What is it? It's nothing. ''o beautiful rain, I can't stop you anymore.'' ''o beautiful rain, as a tragic tale..'' ''..stay in my heart.'' ''Move fast along with the sky.'' ''You have to leave this cold mountain.'' ''o beautiful rain, I can't stop you anymore.'' ''o beautiful rain..'' Why are you avoiding me? What's wrong with you? Abhi, you said you would talk to my father. What did he say? did he say no? Your father didn't say no. I decided against it. - Why? Because of some doubts. - doubts? on whom? - on your love. Hey, you are kidding me? You are the one who play pranks. No, I am not playing a prank. I truly love you. Then swear on me. Abhi, you don't believe me? How would I believe you? Your marriage is already fixed.. ..and now you say you love me. You are even ready to elope with me. What's the guaranty that you won't leave me.. ..if you get someone better than me tomorrow? Abhi, what do you think of me? do I look like some characterless girl? Yes, tell me who is there whom you didn't betray. You betrayed your would-be husband. You betrayed your mother. You betrayed your father. What's the guaranty that you won't betray me now? When I see you I doubt how many more.. ..such affairs you had before this? Hey, devdas! Eeryone believes me so easily. That's what the problem is. This rain might unite the earth and sky.. ..but it can't unite Nandini and me. I am leaving. What? You want to come with me? If you come with me you won't be able to see me suffering. No. You stay here and attend this wedding. It would dawn in another two hours. I need to shut down the bar. I beg you, don't drink any more. I have been watching you since last night. What's the matter with you? What's the matter with me? My story ended even it before it began. Gie me one more bottle. I beg you in return. What's this! opening a bar on highway.. ..has become a headache. Gautam, it seems that the road has been blocked. I will find out if there is some other way. - ok, go. Excuse me! Is there any other way here? A tree fell down due to rain. When the rain can turn people's lies upside down.. ..these trees are nothing. Excuse me! - Yes. - one minute. Is there any other way to go to colonel Choudhary's home? This is the only way. I'm getting married to colonel Choudhary's daughter tomorrow. I am his would-be son-in-law. The tree fell down due to rain. Can you help me out to reach there in some way? Please come. I'm the one who would be marrying Nandini.. ..but not you. die. Now die. Hey! Why do you feel bad? You loved Nandini. I too loved her. But God didn't let any of us marry that girl. Not just the plots, even girls have owners. God registered that girl on his name. Let's forget her. Let us forget that girl. Why should you and I fight? Let's forget her. Hi! - Hi! - My name is Gautam. There's no use even if I tell you my name. I didn't get it. - it's better if you don't get it. Anyway, my car's got a puncher. Can you help me? I think I am destined to help you. Come on. Thank you so much. You didn't tell me your name till now. - What's in the name? Alright. My marriage is at 9:30. Please come inside. It's alright. I need to go urgently. Please let me go. It's ok. It's a nice watch. You saved my life. I will keep this watch in your memory. I would give this to my wife as a gift. It's alright if you don't like it. I can't give you as I like it very much. There are many memories hidden in this watch. It should be with me. It should always be with me. It's alright. Happy married life! - Thank you so much. Bye. Bye. ok, bye. Come. Sit down. Smile a bit, bride. Excuse me, girls! Can I talk to my wife? Come on. Come on. Let's go. Nandu, you must tell us later what you talked about. Hi! Hi! - Ever since the engagement.. ..I used to keep your photo in my pocket and talk to you. Today you are right in front of me. I am happy, Nandini. I am thankful to your dad. I never thought that an orphan like me.. ..would get a great girl like you. I am very happy, Nandini. Attention ! - Yes, sir. You have a good spirit. But right now I am your father-in-law.. ..and you are my son-in-law. Your place is always in my heart. - Thank you, uncle. All the best for the new life you are about to begin. - Thank you. Gautam, will you drink before the wedding.. ..or after the wedding? - Stop pulling my leg, uncle! ok, then, we shall have a peg tomorrow eening. daddy. Go and get ready. - ok. - ok. Yes, dear. daddy, I am sorry daddy. What for sorry, girl? If I have done anything wrong unknowingly forgive me, daddy. Why would you do anything wrong? If I've done anything wrong as your father please forgive me. All I want is your happiness. My innocent girl! Why did you come with me, devdas? What do I have in my life? I saw a girl and lost my heart to her, but it was broken. I lit the light of love, but the rain had put it out. ma, where is Abhi? He is the reason this marriage is taking place. I can never forget the faor he did on me. I will explain you everything after the wedding. Find out where he is now. We are getting late. Like someone said a person should have two hearts. one for loing and one for forgetting. I don't know, ma'am. He went out on car last night. I couldn't see him anywhere since morning. Alright. You can go. Uma, where is the young man? - He went out. This place would be bustling only when he is around. My wife is hesitating to tell you, but my son must be.. ..roaming around somewhere like a nomad. When would our son mend his ways? When would he mature a bit? He has already matured a Very, but we still have to. I was stuck in this rain called love and lost my path. What I loved most gave me the greatest pain. What's the matter? Whenever I used to say something.. ..you used to ring the bell against my wish. You are not ringing it now. You don't want to hurt me further? Hey, talk to me. If you don't talk to me who else will talk to me. You are asleep? Get up. Hey, get up! devdas. devdas. devdas. devdas. 'devdas, I can't forget you.' 'Love tickles young boys and girls like first drizzle.' 'Some people's love end on a positie note..' '..and for some it leaves painful memories behind.' 'our movie is dedicated to those..' '..who cherish those beautiful memories.'
