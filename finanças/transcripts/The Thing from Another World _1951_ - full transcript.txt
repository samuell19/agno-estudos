Hi, Eddie. Hiya, Scotty. Cold enough for you? Oh, I'm only faintly alive. It's 25 below. You know everybody? We haven't met. McPherson. - I'll. - Ned Scott, Captain Hendry. Scotty just Got in today. Hi. Care to join us? Wait till I count my fingers. I may have lost one. Scotty's A warm weather man. We met at Accra. Quite a spot-- 105 in the shade, The women hardly Wore anything at all. Which was very intelligent of 'eh. Lie there in a hammock while 3 Of them stand there fanning you. - Remember, Scotty? - I remember. Oh, boy, when I die, I hope I go to Accra. - I was there. - I'm in. What are you Doing here, Mr. Scott? Looking For a story. Scotty's a newspaperman. - How many? 3. - Cards? - I'll play these. Caught from ambush. Check. Well, I'll bet a buck. And I'll fold. Call. - Pair of Queens. - I thought so... Aces. Ought to know better than Try fooling our captain. Only dames can do that. - Lieutenant dykes, I promised-- - Slip of the tongue. What do you hear from The General? General Fogarty. He's nursing His secrets like a June bride. I got an Idea. There's a guy in Seattle knows The whole radar defense story. Loves to talk-- general McLaren. You tell general Fogarty You wanna go to Seattle. Pat and I will fly you there. I met General McLaren too. It's warm in Seattle. They got girls there. Without fur pants on. - what about it, Captain? - they could be right. You'll never be able to shoo Our captain southward With his heart wrapped Around the north pole. - that will do-- - what's going on up there? Some scientists are holding A convention up there. Looking for polar bear tales. Ever hear of Dr. Carrington? - The fellow who was at Bikini? - The same. They're about 2,000 Miles north of here-- Botanists, Physicists, electronic-- Including a pin-up girl. - Very interesting Type, too. - Very. Captain Hendry can give you Any data you want on her. You shouldn't Have said that. Now, look... Someday I hope to have A navigator and a copilot Who are at least Dry behind the ears. - oh, captain. - you mail-order-- captain Hendry, report to general Fogarty's Quarters at once please. 8:00 at night, and the general Yelling for his troops. Sounds like The old days. - take my hand, Will you? - yeah. Hey, captain, if it Amounts to anything, - bring me in on it, Will you, please"? - sure. I got to get A story someplace. Come in! Close the door. Yes, sir. Good evening, sir. Didn't take you long To get here. Not many places To hide. Got a queer message from Your picnic party up north, From Dr. Carrington himself. "Believe an airplane unusual Type crashed in our vicinity. Please send facilities To investigate. Most urgent." What do you suppose You'd find up there, Besides A good-looking girl"? I don't know, sir. - any ships missing? - no. - no Canadians, either. - could be Russians. They're all over The pole like flies. - you're going. - yes, sir. Take a dog team or anything You need for rescue. Come in. Close the door! But do you suppose the pentagon Could send us a revolving door? Could be, sir. We got 10 pith helmets last week. - weather report, Sir. - okay, that's all. Tell the O.D. If more messages Come in from Dr. Carrington, I wanna be notified Personally no matter the time. Well, here's your weather. A front's moving in, But you ought to make it back Without bumping into it. General, that Newspaperman Scott-- - yeah, what about him? - he'd like to go With us. It's alright If you maroon him up there. Don't get me wrong About who gets marooned. And I'd appreciate it if you Didn't smash anything this time. That was An unavoidable accident. Well, look, I'll expect you Back sometime tomorrow night. Yes, sir. I'll close the door. Just tell me What you find up there. No one tells me Anything around here. Want some coffee? - hey, thanks. - here you are, sir. Mr. Scott... Coffee. Are we there? No, sir. Hot coffee Up front, sir. Oh. Lieutenant? Coffee, sir. Thank you, Stewardess. Coffee? Yeah, thanks. How far are we From camp? 3 hours. We've slowed down. A little Headwind. A little headwind? Close to 40 miles. Our captain has some funny Ideas about the north pole. He thinks it's a garden spot. Come and bring the kiddies. Now, look. Don't You two guys start. You know Peary went to The North Pole once. He retired with a sack Full of medals. - hey, pat. - you know we go there Every 3 weeks Just like it was Lovers' lane. Mr. Scott, some people Seem to think-- Wait a minute. Hello, air force 191, 191 From polar expedition 6, Can you read me? Air force 191, hear You fine, Tex. Go ahead. What's your position? 3 hours out. Captain, switch over To your radio compass And check it against Your magnetic heading. What's On your mind, Tex? We've got some kind Of disturbance up here, And it's whacking away At everything. What do you figure It's from? Don't know. We noticed it last night. 6 to 8 degrees Difference, pat. We're quite A bit off here, Tex. Better home in on me. I'll leave the key open. Would you rather Have me sing to you? Leave the key open. I was afraid You'd say that. Hey, the taxpayers Ought to see this. Hello, doctor... Professor. - hello. - still the same game? Yes. Morning. Doctor... Professor, Here's your mail. You're just in Time for lunch. Ken, I bet you Forgot my hairpins. I'm practically At the north pole. Looks more like My old Kentucky home. Mr. Scott... Mrs. Chapman. A pleasure, Mrs. Chapman. Dr. Chapman... Mr. Scott. - Dr. Chapman. - Scotty?s a newspaperman. You've come at An opportune time. I was in anchorage when Your message arrived. I hope you have A good story. - no more than you Probably know already. - nothing more at all? Just discussions To what it might be. We all have different ideas. There's been arguments about it. - where's Dr. Carrington?~? - he's in the lab. Dr. Chapman-- Hi, lee. - coffee, captain? - no, thanks. Our captain's In a hurry. - where are You two going? - with you -- Wanna tell her that's an awful Way to treat our captain. If you don't want Us... I'll get even with You two someday. Come in. Hi, pat. Welcome to our igloo. How was your-- Well... How was your trip? It was alright. About usual. Well, that's fine. I think Dr. Carrington Wants to see you. Dr. Carrington can wait. I wanna talk to you. That was a dirty trick You played on me. Don't lose Your temper. Why did you do it? Well, your legs Aren't very pretty. You wrote a note And put it on my chest. Others got up Before I did. 6 people read it Before I woke up. The whole force Is laughing. - not so loud. They'll hear you. - they've already heard. The only place it hasn't been Is a billboard. Ooh, I didn't know you Had such a nasty temper. Now, pat, Just be careful. Now, take it easy. Now, wait a minute. We had a lot of fun When you were up here. Then when you asked me Down to anchorage You deliberately fed me-- Did you really drink All those drinks? - mm-mmm. - you didn't throw Any away? Not a one? Holy cats, I thought I was good. Another thing, Why did you leave? When I woke up, You were gone. I told you I had to take That cargo plane back here. - you told me? - don't you remember? No. Right after dinner. You were telling me All about A night in San Francisco... - I told you that? - mm-mmm. Ohh. What else did I do? Well, you had moments of Making like an octopus. I never saw so many Hands in all my life. Alright. Alright. Look, my only excuse Is that I liked you... Right away. So I started wrong. Can't we begin again? How would you begin? Well, I can Think of several-- Never mind. We don't have time For that now. I know Dr. Carrington's Waiting to see you. What about this business Of starting over again? We'll talk about that later. - hello, captain. - hi, professor. Dr. Carrington, Captain Hendry is here. Yes, I know. - how do you do, Captain? - doctor. Miss Nicholson, would you Add a note to the others? Surely. "November 2nd, 11:30 am. "Deviation in sector 19 "Continues 12 degrees, 20 minutes east. No lessening or wavering Of disturbing element." That's all. Well, captain, Can we start now? Where are we Going, doctor? 48 miles due east From here. Your message said An airplane crash. Is that what We're looking for? I don't know, captain. - you better Explain, doctor. - oh, I'm sorry. Miss Nicholson, would you read Captain Hendry My first notes? I was only thinking of the Vagueness of my information. I dislike being vague. - "November 1st--" - yesterday. "6:15 pm. Sound detectors And seismographs "Registered explosion Due east. "At 6:18, magnetometer Revealed deviation 12 degrees, 20 minutes east." That deviation Has been constant. We ran into it just Before arriving. "Such deviation possible Only if a disturbing force Equivalent to 20,000 tons Of steel or iron ore--" 20,000 tons? "Had become Part of the earth At about A 50-mile radius." Getting a bit beyond me But it sounds like a meteor. Yes, very much, Except for one thing. We'll show it To captain Hendry. Oh, yes, sir. We have some special Telescopic cameras. On the appearance Of radioactivity, A geiger counter Trips the release And the cameras function. They were working Last evening. This is the result. This first picture Was taken 3 minutes Before the explosion-- Or 6:12. You can see The small dot Low there In the corner. On the next picture, One minute later, It is moving From west to east, Moving fast enough To form a streak. - what's shutter speed? - 1,000th of a second. Moving pretty fast, Wasn't it? Lab It's moving upward. At 6:15, it drops To the earth and vanishes. A meteor might move almost Horizontal to the earth, But never upward. - it isn't a meteor. - that's obvious. How's the distance to the point Of impact determined? - by computation. - Dr. Carrington... It's quite simple, Captain. We have the time Of arrival Of the sound waves And the detectors And the arrival time Of the impact waves And the seismograph. By computing the difference, It becomes quite obvious That they were caused By a traveling object. The distance from here's Approximately 48 miles. You lost me, but I'll take Your word for it. 20,000 tons of steel Is a lot of metal For an airplane. It is for the sort Of airplane we know, captain. Yeah, we'd Better be going. I thought You'd think so. Redding, check Every quarter hour. - will you want me? - no, it won't Be necessary. You coming, bill? Yes, doctor. We'll be there Pretty soon now, pat. Bob, get Carrington Up here. Doctor! We're almost 50 Miles out, doctor. With your compass Deviation, How are you navigating, Captain? That peak ahead is Practically due east. We got the wind Before we left camp. We should be There about now, pat. 10... 9... 8... 7... 6... Picking up something On the geiger counter, sir. 4..3... 2..1. Look there. Pat, the compass Is in a spin. Geiger's Up to the top. Yeah, that's it, Alright. Did you see someplace To set down? Looked smooth About a half a mile back. We'll take a look. Bob! Get them ready. It might be rough. Fasten your seat belts, Gentlemen. We're gonna land. sit down, and hold on Back there. All set For landing, sir. Half flaps. Full rich. Full rich. Half flaps. There we are. Holy cats! What a weird-looking Thing. Let me get a picture Before you track up the place. This geiger counter's Going crazy. Something's melted That surface crust. It's frozen over again Into clear ice. The bottle shape was Caused by the aircraft First making contact With the earth Out there at the neck Of the bottle, Sliding toward us and Forming that larger area As it came to rest. With the engine or engines Generating enough heat To melt that path Through the crust, Then sink Beneath the surface. What could melt That much ice? Let's go down And see. Barnes. Take the dogs Over on that side. Dr. Chapman, could an Airplane melt that much ice? One of our own jets Generates enough heat To warm A 50-story building. It's part Of an airfoil-- Probably a stabilizer Of some sort. It's an airplane, Alright. Can you tell What metal that is? - I'll need some tools. - Barnes, bring some tools! Hey, it's down Pretty deep over here. I can't see anything But a dark mass. It's deeper Over here. Captain, may I suggest That we spread out And try to determine The size and shape? Right. Spread out, everybody! We're going to try to figure Out the shape of this thing. Here's the tools, sir. Holy cat! Hey... It's almost... Yeah. Almost a perfect... It is. It's round. We finally got one. We found A flying saucer! Can anybody see Anything through the ice? Only an outline. Nothing but A dark shape. Seems perfectly smooth. No doors or windows. I can't see Any engine. I doubt we'll find Anything we call an engine. Dr. Carrington, this isn't Any metal I know. Probably some new alloy. Get some filings For analysis. Right. Captain, I don't think We have a chance Of chopping through The ice with axes. I know. We think so, too. We're gonna melt it Out with Thermite bombs. Doctor, where do you Figure it's from? I don't know, Mr. Scott. Well, from this planet? - I doubt it. - do you think-- The answers to your Questions will be easier After we've examined The interior of the aircraft, And its occupants, If there are any. Occupants? Why, I never-- What a story! Where's the radio? Hey, Barnes! Hold it. Sorry. No private messages. What do you mean "Private"? I'm Sending it to the whole world. This is air force Information. Wait until authority lets you File your story. You've got your authority In the constitution of the United states. It's called freedom of the Press. I'm sending a story. Not from our ship. Where do you Want the bombs? One by the stabilizer. Another over there. This is the biggest story Since the parting Of the red sea. You can't cover it up. Think what it means. Not working for the world. I'm working for-- - look, sonny-- - no, Scott. I'll take that. Get back to the ship And call the camp. Have Tex radio Fogarty We found a flying saucer, A disc--whatever you call it-- Intact, embedded in the ice. What about me? Ask if Scott can have clearance To send his story. - that's all I can do. - don't apologize. You'll grow up to be Another Fogarty. - where'll we touch this off? - over there. Look toward the west. That front's moving fast, And the temperature's Dropping, too. We don't have More than an hour. Where do you Put those? On the surface. Oh, tell stone. Right. Say, what will This Thermite do? This is S.O.P.-- Standard operating procedure For removing ice-- Hook this wire up, Lieutenant. It just melts it. How fast does it work? It will uncover the whole Saucer in 30 seconds. All ready over here! - be right with you! - better clear the field! Over near the dog sled! Gonna get hot Around here in a minute. Okay, bob, hook her up. We'll try The stabilizer first. Use the other one if needed. A few minutes from now, we may Have the key to the stars. A million years of history Awaiting us in that ice. Say when. I wanna get a picture. - all ready, sir. - ready here. Let her go, bob. Okay, all clear. Wait, everybody. Stay back. It's burning Under the ice. Careful, captain. What's happening? Tell me, doctor! Get down on the ground, Everybody! Whew! Everybody alright? That last explosion Was the engine. Sergeant, will you try Your geiger counter? Only a trace. That's just residual. It's all gone. Secrets that might've Given us a new science-- - gone. - that's just dandy. Standard operating Procedure. Ha! - I should have thought... - you sure should. The greatest discovery In history up in flames. Turning a new civilization into A 4th of July piece. Captain, I'm getting Something over here. Probably a fragment From the saucer. We may Salvage something yet. Hold it, everybody. I'm getting a reaction. Let me get a reading. It's getting warm... Hotter now... Here's where It's coming from. - what is it? - looks like a man. It's got legs and a head. I can see it. Yeah. He must be over 8 feet long. Somebody got out Of that saucer. Got out or was thrown out? Then frozen fast Before he could get clear. Man from mars. - how do we get him out? - I don't know. Use more Thermite. Whichever's quickest. We don't have much time. Here's axes. You could Chop around it And put the whole block On the sled. - I agree. - get started. Bob, clear the sled off And bring it over here. Eddie, get The ship warmed up. Be ready to get out Of here in a hurry. Pat, I think We made a mistake. - what do you mean? - you ever read this? "Department of defense, Office of public information, "Washington, D.C. December 27, 1949. "Bulletin 629-49 Regarding item number 6,700, "Extract 75,131. "The air force has Discontinued investigating "And evaluating Reported flying saucers On the basis that there Is no evidence." They'll probably Make you a general For destroying evidence That they're wrong. "The air force said That all evidence indicates "That the reports of Unidentified flying objects "Are the result of-- "One--misinterpretation Of various Conventional objects." Didn't look very Conventional to me. "Second--a mild form Of mass hysteria--" That'd be When general Fogarty Shook hands with That thing in the ice. What are The other reasons? "Third-- That they're jokes." What was the number Of that bulletin? "629-49, item 6,700, Extract 75,131." Oh... Oh, that one. Whoa! Whoa! Get on that rope, Professor. I need a hand Over here. Watch your feet. Watch your feet. Keep it tight On that end. Here we go. Hold it there! Hold it! Pull back there. Keep tight On those ropes! Easy now. Keep it going. Keep it going! Whoa! Take it easy. Can't see through The ice too good. Good enough to know That where he's from They sure don't breed Them for beauty. Well what do we now? Defrost him? This ice will melt Pretty soon. Can you control The heat here? No. This is Our storeroom. The temperature's Constant here. That won't be Necessary. We can probably chip The ice away. We're not gonna Melt or chip it. Eddie, open that window. - we're not allowed to examine it? - I mean just that. This is stupid. - We're scientists. And Dr. Carrington's In charge here. Hey, pat. These windows Don't open. It's practically certain Your superiors will Ask us to study it. Probably. But we Can't permit it now. - we don't need Permiss-- - break that window. Alright. Sorry. We already pulled One boner out in the ice. I may not know Anything about this, But until my superior Gives instructions, We'll have to mark time. Captain, you have No author- Better talk in the corridor. It's going to get cold here. At last, a very sensible Suggestion, captain. - Mac. - yeah? You stay here. Take 4-hour shifts. - and it's hands off. Understand??? - yes, sir. Going to be Warm enough? If not, I'll squawk. Bob'll bring You some dinner. How about Something to read? A nice quiet Horror story. Might be Kind of tame for you. Well, gentlemen? - captain-- - captain-- Excuse me, doctor. May 1? In relation to Removing the body, I'd like to Point out Some organisms Survive after death, But cold Can destroy them. In view of that-- Doctor, I don't know-- But these organisms May be dangerous. They may be carrying germs From another planet, Germs we couldn't Cope with medically. I can't agree, Dr. Chapman. I don't Either. We also don't know What effect our air May have on this Creature's remains. Sort of go up in smoke, Like the saucer? Isn't that Far-fetched? So is a man From mars. Gentlemen, we're Getting nowhere. I suggest that Captain Hendry Communicate With his superior. We should have Done that first thing. I'm surprised you didn't Try to reach your general On our way back here. We did. I tried through your Radio operator. Couldn't get through. Too much interference. I see. My apologies, captain. Yes, doctor. - hi, captain. - hi, Tex. Sure stirred up Some trouble-- We're in a hurry. Did you send out my message? Sure did. Answer came an hour ago. - can you read it? - no. "Fogarty to Hendry. "Withhold Newspaper story Until permission From air force HQ." There you are. Now somebody else Will get the story. "Remove aircraft From ice at once. Use Thermite bombs if Necessary to melt ice." Ah, that's what I like About the army-- Smart all the way To the top. That lets you off the Hook for the Thermite-- Take it easy. Go ahead, Tex. "Erect temporary structure To protect aircraft Until my arrival." Here's another one. Came a few minutes ago. Could only get Part of it. "Everything grounded. Can't join you--" Something or other. "Want you--" Something or other. That sounds Like Fogarty. Then it got Really fouled up. You're not Getting anything? Nothing. Static's Knocking it out. What about your stuff? Don't know if They're getting it. I doubt it. Even the pony express Got through. - well, doctor? - in view of this New situation -- Doesn't alter The old one. We disagree. There's No reason to delay-- Sorry, gentlemen. That's it. Tex, Barnes Will help you. Sure, captain. Keep trying To get through. I want to get a message To the general. Tell him the aircraft Was completely destroyed By the Thermite bomb. Tell him we found A passenger-- You got a fella From mars? Where? On ice, buddy. On ice. Tell him we're keeping It on ice, Dr. Carrington Wants permission To remove the body from The ice for examination. We're standing by For instructions Before further action. Anything to add, doctor? Yes, one very Essential point-- That I consider it Vitally important That the examination be made. Add that, Barnes. Thank you, captain. That's all concerns me. When you get your answer, Let me know. Yes, doctor. Wait?ll I interview The doctor About what He thinks of you. Ought to be good. If it isn't, I'll make it. Tex, keep trying. If he gets through, Ask about clearing Mr. Scott. Don't try To soft-soap me. I'll eat With you, Eddie. I'll send you boys Back some chow. Captain, I'll check The ship, tie her down. We'll need our gear. Pretty bad storm out there. Get those Eskimos To help you. They took off when They saw the ice. May take some coaxing To get them back. If Mr. Scott and the lieutenant Would give me a hand-- - I thought I was a guest. - I'm an officer. You can order me around while Carrying the other end. That'll help a lot, Sarge. Pat, I thought we were Gonna have trouble tonight. So did I. Those geniuses were Ready to tear you apart. Ah, they're kids, 9-year-olds Drooling over a new fire engine. Professor Voorhees, come to the laboratory as soon as possible. Holding a meeting. Whole thing's weird. Reminds me of the time I was stuck on Buluan Island With the old 97th Bomber group. An army nurse came Ashore one day And caused about The same disturbance As this guy from mars Has around here. What happened To the nurse? She liked it there. Scotty, what's new? What's new? What more Do you want? Biggest story ever To hit this planet, And I run into This human clam. Who are you getting pretty for? You'll never look good. That's not For you, Scotty. The captain here Passes the buck To general Fogarty. Fogarty takes it to Washington. Who will Truman ask When it gets to him? Margaret. I've got to get Back to civilization. - how, for instance? - I don't know. Pogo sticks, kiddie cars, Gondolas, dog sleds-- Hey, Barnes, any word From general Fogarty? Plenty. Nothing About you, sir. I think the old Man's gone crazy. Sorry, sir, I shouldn't Have said that, But if he hollers any louder, We won't need a radio. What was the gist of The general's conversation? It was scrambled, But there's been a leak, And the newspapers -- I knew it. Like pouring water Through a sieve. Everybody wants More information-- Congress, secretary of state, And especially, General Fogarty. He's having a fit. Isn't anchorage Picking up anything? No. We're picking up Them--stronger station. A picture just came to me. My editor climbing All over his office, Yelling, stamping his Feet, breaking windows. He'll probably shoot Himself by midnight. Just a minute, captain. I'm not sure you're ready. You may have missed A spot. Wouldn't want her To see our captain-- Would you like to do Double guard duty tonight? No, sir, I wouldn't. - oh, captain. - yes, sergeant? Could I see you For a minute, sir? Sure. What is it, bob? I don't like to Bother you like this, It's about McPherson Sitting in there With that thing In the block of ice. Getting nervous? He wouldn't want Me to tell you, But he's Having kittens. I haven't heard him squawk Like this since Reichenberg. Really? The ice Is clearing up, And we can see that thing Pretty good. It's got crazy hands And no hair, And the eyes... They're open, And they look like they can see. Bob-- It's got me, Too, sir, And I wasn't In there very long. Besides, it's pretty cold. I got the lieutenant An electric blanket. Captain, I got a suggestion. Go ahead. We could split these 4-hour shifts-- Ok. Tell Barnes to Take over at 2200. You take over at 2400, And I'll relieve you At 0200. I think You're right, sir. I think you are. Thank you, sir. I want to talk To you. Sure. Pat, what's really Going on? Oh, nothing. I can't Relieve your pals, So I set a guard. They'd have that thing Out waltzing with him. It's not my job to decide. That's not What I meant. What does that bogeyman In ice mean? I don't know. Does it mean that we're Going to have visitors From other worlds, Other planets, Dropping in on us? Do we have to return The call? Or... I know. Yesterday I'd say it was crazy. I'd say it's crazy now. Many people Think so, too. Forget it. Tomorrow It'll all seem different. I suppose so. I like the way you Handled this mess, pat. I'd just as soon not-- It's funny, I'm glad I was here. I am, too. You're much nicer When you're-- When you're not mad. Sounds promising. How about that business Of beginning over again? Well, I think I'll buy You a drink this time. I think You've earned it. That is if you want one. You can tie my hands If you want to. That might not be Such a bad idea. You mean that? Well, you suggested it. Alright. I'll bring a rope. You want another one, pat? Don't you think you Could untie me now? Mm, I don't know. What's the matter? If a guy asks you to have Dinner, a drink, And tries to kiss, He's a wolf-- What are you Laughing at? - you never Kissed me. - I haven't tried. - how do you know? - stop bringing that up. Never mind. You haven't. Maybe if you'd-- Go on with what You were saying. you know, about The dinner and the drink. If the same man Asked you To have 30,000 dinners And drinks-- Then he's not a wolf anymore. That's a fine philosophy. So you really want Your hands untied-- Just when everything was So nice and peaceful. I'm glad we decided To start over again. I like it. I like that, too. Oh, talk about Japanese tortures. No, not at all. I think this was a great idea. Come here. Well, look at you. Sitting there like a civilized man, Instead of grabbing Around like a throwback. You got a match? If you weren't tied up, I wouldn't dare tell you How much I like you. You know, pat, the trouble with you Is you don't know anything about women. What a woman wants Is to-- Is to-- How long have you Been loose? Long enough. It's been a very Interesting evening. Good night, Miss Nicholson. Pat, if you walk Out on me-- Don't worry. I wouldn't go, Except I Got to check up-- Aw, get a Good night's sleep. I'll see you In the morning. It's the eyes being open That gets you. - hi, pat. - hi. Barnes just got here. Glad I'm not looking At that guy anymore. All set, Barnes? Got an electric suit And a pot of coffee. Bob'll relieve you at 2400. - right, sir. - take it easy. Yeah. That's better. Captain Hendry! Captain Hendry! Captain Hendry. What's the matter, Corporal? Where's the captain? I've got to tell him. That thing's alive. I saw it, sir. It chased me. That thing's alive. It's not dead. It's-- Captain Hendry! That thing's alive. I saw it--I shot at it. I know it. Nothing happened. It just came at me, Making a noise Like a cat mewing. Those hands And those eyes! You've got to Do something-- Mac, bob, Get some guns. Barnes, what happened? Sorry, sir, I don't know exactly, But all of a sudden It was alive And coming at me. I shot at it. Nothing happened, So I slammed The door and ran! Easy, easy. Here, captain. Take care of him, Will you? Stay back here. Get back with The rest of 'em. What could've... The kid said he was Alive. I believe him. I knew it. I could feel it. Here's What did it. This blanket was on And still warm. Wilders He got out of here, Alright. Bring parkas, boots, And a flashlight! They'll tear him To pieces! We must save him. - hold it! - he mustn't be hurt! You'll freeze to death. Use your head! You're right. I was overanxious. Look over here, Captain! Alright, I think I've got yours. May I have one, captain? Better let us go. Can you see anything Out there? Not much. - you all set? - let her go. Captain, it would help If you--any of you-- Would describe What you saw out there. It was too cold to see well, But the dogs had him down. He got up with 3 Hanging on his arm. - he threw one At the rest. - 2 were dead. Looked like they'd Been through a chopper. Where did you Find the arm? Partly under one of 'em. Couldn't dogs Tear off an arm? This kind Of an arm. Be careful, doctor. Those barbs are sharp. Seems to be some Chitinous substance. Speak English, doctor. Something between a beetle's Back and a rose thorn. Thorn-fingered? Amazingly strong. Very effective As a weapon. Don't have to worry About that. With an arm off In that cold? He's dead now. Got along all right In that block of ice. Pretty spry for a guy With 12 dogs on him. After losing an arm. Amazing, isn't it? Amazingly strong. Strange. I'm sure of it. That is blood, Isn't it? Yes, but not his blood. Probably from One of the dogs. There's no blood In the arm, No animal tissue. Dr. Stern, Will you look at this Under the microscope? No, Mr. Scott, I doubt if it can die As we understand dying. Holy cats! Yes. Well, doctor? No arterial structure indicated. No nerve endings visible. Porous, unconnected, Cellular growth. Just a minute, doctor. Sounds like you're trying To describe a vegetable. I am. Are you getting All of this? Oh, for Pete's sake! You know, doctor, That could be why Sergeant Barnes' bullets Had no effect. Merely holes drilled Into vegetable matter. This green fluid Here... Like plant sap. Probably has A sugar base. Please, I've got to Ask this. It sounds as though You're describing Some form Of super carrot. That's nearly right, Mr. Scott. This carrot, As you call it, Has constructed An aircraft Capable of flying millions Of miles through space Propelled by a force As yet unknown to us. An intellectual carrot! The mind boggles. Shouldn't. Imagine how Strange it would have seemed During the Pliocene age To Forecast that worms, Fish, and Lizards Were going to Evolve into us. Look, Doctor-- On the planet from which Our visitor came, Vegetable life Underwent an Evolution Similar to that Of our own animal life, Which accounts for The superiority Of its brain. Its development was not Handicapped by emotional Or sexual factors. Dr. Carrington, You won the Nobel Prize. You've received every kind Of international kudos A scientist can attain. If you were for sale, I could get a million bucks From any foreign government. I'm not going to stick my neck Out and say You're stuffed Absolutely clean Full of wild Blueberry muffins. But I promise my readers Will think so. Not for long, Mr. Scott, Not if they Know anything About the flora Of their own planet. There are vegetables On earth that can... Think? A certain kind Of thinking, yes. Ever hear of The telegraph vine? Not recently. Or the... Is it The acanthus century plant? Yes. Go ahead, doctor. That's your field. The century plant catches Mice, bats, squirrels, Any small mammals. Uses a sweet Syrup as bait, Then holds on to its catch And feeds on it. What's the Telegraph vine? A vine, Research has proven, Can signal to other vines Of the same species 20 to 100 miles away. Intelligence in plants And vegetables Is an old story, Mr. Scott, Older even than The animal arrogance That has overlooked it. That's one For Ripley. I took this from Under the soft tissue Of the palm Of the hand. Seed pod! Seed pod! Yes. The neat And unconfused Reproductive technique Of vegetation. No pain or pleasure As we know it. No emotions. No heart. Our superior. Our superior in every way. Gentlemen, do you realize What we've found? A being from another world, As different from us As one pole From the other. If we can only Communicate with it, We can learn secrets That have been hidden From mankind Since the beginning-- Holy cats! It's moving. Miss Nicholson. Yes, doctor? At 12:10 am. The hand became alive. The temperature of the forearm Showed a 20-degree rise. Because of this Temperature rise, I believe it was able to Ingest the canine blood With which It was covered. You mean... You mean It lives on blood. It's the best We could find. If it doesn't work, I don't know what will. Where are you going? To find our visitor If we can. One moment, captain! Check the storeroom again. Bolt any outside doors. Captain, when you find What you're looking for, Remember it's a stranger In a strange land. The only crimes were those Committed against it. Woke from a block of ice, It was attacked by dogs, Shot by a frightened man. All I want is a chance To communicate with it. You can do anything you want, Provided it's locked up In a safe place. Captain, if we catch him, Let me take his picture Before somebody Makes a salad of him. Sure, Scotty. I'll think about it. Bob, get up there. Hey, what's up? Looks like A lynching party. - any visitors? - not a soul. I got part of a message From the general. He said to wait On Mr. Scott's story. Ah, nothing's Going out anyway. Hey, what are you Guys looking for? - couldn't come in here. - who? Man from mars. He's alive And running loose? Keep your door locked. Use your fire ax. Gun's no good. What do you mean A gun's no good? Eddie. Hold it, captain. There's something In here, alright. No. You're a little off-base. That's the mineralogy lab. We've got radioactive Isotopes in there. The Geiger?s reacting to a room Full of uranium ore samples. Yeah. This door's locked. Dr. Stern Has the key. None of the others Were locked. What's in here? The greenhouse. The Eskimos have A weakness for our strawberries. Strawberries At the north pole. Mac, bob. Look under These tables. Bob, check That outside door. Door's locked, sir. Nothing up here. We're still Batting zero. Well, doctor-- Captain, I-- Nothing up that Other corridor. Any suggestions? He's obviously Not inside. We'll look Outside-- Close the door, Please. Never mind. Half an hour outside Is all we can stand. We better do it In relay. You're right, Dr. Chapman. Close the door, please. We'll have to tell general Fogarty what happened. We're liable To become famous. So few can boast they've Lost a flying saucer And a man from mars All in one day. What would they Have done to Columbus If he had discovered America And then mislaid it? Bunch of butterfingers! Gentlemen, I just Happened to notice-- Look at these molds. Well, they're wilted. The only thing-- A blast of icy air If that rear door was open. Have a look At that lock. 10 or 15 seconds of such Exposure would do it. Exactly. What would that Lead you to-- That it may have Been in here. Without a doubt. Dr. Carrington, You were right. The lock's been forced And bent back. The key's gone. Someone has Entered and gone And locked The door from... The outside. See how it glistens In the light? It's a smear of... Plant sap. From the wounded arm? You don't suppose-- Open it, please. One of the sled dogs. Not even cold yet. Doesn't it seem Kind of... Shrunken. Is there Any blood in there? - none. - no blood? No blood? Its blood Has been drained. Everything falls Right into line. What could be more natural For such a being Than seeking out the only Open earth within miles? It came here for refuge, Heard us, and ran. It's been here. It will come back again. We better tell Captain-- I don't agree with you. I think it far better If science rather than-- Are you sure This is best? I'm sure we can Communicate with it. We must. It's wiser than we are. It's our only chance To talk to it, To learn so many things. He's right. Surely you understand That, stern. Will you two stand guard Here with me tonight? - surely, doctor. - alright. Stern, tell Dr. Auerbach And Dr. Olson what we've found. Ask them to come back And relieve us In the morning. And tell them, please, To confide in no one. Any luck, captain? Lee! Better get some More coffee ready. - find anything? - not a sign. We poked into every Snow bank within miles. Barnes flushed A polar bear. - sure did. - scare you? Not after I saw It was only a bear. Too cold out there for that. Didn't find anything? I didn't think you would. When we lose them, They stay lost. Not that it makes Much difference. There's nothing Going out on the radio, Nothing coming in. Hey, Tex, You got something? General Fogarty's Running a temperature. This came in clear 10 minutes ago And then it got Fouled up again. "Fogarty to Hendry, take all Precautions to preserve aircraft "Carefully until my arrival. "Same to same. Use same precautions "With corpses Of any occupants. Same to same. Forward Description of aircraft--" Oh, ho ho! "Measurements, approximate Weight, and so forth important. "Fogarty to Hendry. Why haven't you answered? "Want immediate answer. "Same to same. Radio silence unnecessary. "Reference message Fogarty to Hendry-- "Acknowledge immediately. "Fogarty to Hendry. Waiting Report. Silence confusing. "Same to same. Acknowledge. Same to same. Acknowledge at once." I gather he wants To hear from me. - nothing for me? - you got it all. For Pete?s sake. I don't believe it. How can a man Become a general-- In the greenhouse... See-- Barnes, watch that corridor. Bring the first aid Kit, please. Captain, this is my job. Bob, better start Warning everybody. That speaker system Work from here? Yes. The left switch Runs to all rooms. Attention, everybody in camp. Stay where you are, Bolt your doors. Our visitor has returned And is dangerous. Stay where you are until Notified and bolt your doors. Stay where you are. Easy, doctor. Easy. It'll be alright. What happened, doctor? In the greenhouse. I couldn't see. Then a blast of cold air. I heard Olson scream. When I turned, The thing struck at me. Go on. I don't remember. I must have fallen. When I came to, I saw Olson and Auerbach. They were... Get those axes. Go ahead, doctor. They were hanging from The beams upside down. They were dead. Their throats were cut. I crawled from under-- Were they there When you left? I couldn't see. Here, sir. Wait, pat! I want To get a picture. Wait a minute. This greenhouse Has an outside door. He can get out that way. We can get to it from here Through the generator room. You go with him. You want us to go in? Seal the door with Anything you can find. That's better. Easy. Give them Time to get there. Pat, I want a picture. - you get back With the rest. - don't be silly. It'll cost you A drink. I'll buy him a beer. Ready, bob? No, but go ahead And open it. Grrr! Get something To prop this door! Something short enough To get under this bolt! Get your picture, Scotty? No, you were In the way. the door wasn?t Open long enough. - want me to Open it again? - no! Bring a hammer And some spikes! Hit that in. There. That ought to do it. You're sure there's No other way out? No windows, skylights, Or vents of any kind? Only the front And back doors. Are these walls solid? Corrugated iron. You don't think-- Dr. Carrington, we just learned You found a dog in there, Bled white the visitor. Why didn't you report it? I didn't consider it necessary. You let your friends In there to be killed. I posted them as guards-- Stern was right. I looked in. They're hanging upside down Like in a slaughterhouse. Can't we Do something? They're dead. Our job is to See nobody joins them. You're limited To your room, Laboratory, And the mess. You have No authority to-- Bob. doctor, you better move along. We've got The rear door blocked. If he gets out, he'll have To dig through 20 oil drums And a couple tons Of snow and ice. Bob, next time, raise The sights a little. Sorry, I was too busy To think about that. We'll have to Set up a guard here In the junction And the corridor. 2-hour shifts. We'll need volunteers. Glad to, captain. Count me in, captain. You sent for us, doctor. You said you had News for us, doctor. Ah, yes. Yes, I have. Gentlemen, we find Ourselves in a battle. I'm not referring To the minor argument With captain Hendry, But this creature From a new world. 2 of our colleagues Have died, A third is injured. Those are our losses And there may be more. This creature Is more powerful And more intelligent Than we are. He regards us as important Only for his nourishment. He has the same Attitude toward us As we have toward a... Field of cabbages. That is our battle. Only science Can conquer him. All other weapons Will be powerless, only... There must... There must be a way. I've been trying to... Sorry. I'm very tired. I haven't slept. It's difficult... Difficult to talk. Read my notes, Miss Nicholson. Doctor, you need Some rest. Yes, I know, But... Please read My notes. "At 9 pm, I placed the seeds "Taken from the severed Hand of "X" "In 4 inches of earth. "I saturated the earth... "I saturated the earth With 2 units of plasma "Taken From our blood bank. "The condition of the dog Found in the greenhouse. "Indicated that blood Was a primal factor "In the cultivation Of the seeds. "At 2 am... At 2 am., the first sprouts Appeared through the soil." - five hours. - No-- Yes. I used another 2 units of plasma. At 4 am., the sprouts began To take on definite form. I came to the conclu-- I see by your faces You don't believe me. Well, you may judge For yourselves. Oh, no, it isn't Possible. It reproduces itself... Amazing speed. This would bear out Captain Hendry?s impression. When he saw the creature In the door of the greenhouse, It seemed to have Grown a new arm. This, uh, pulsating, Doctor? As though... They were breathing. Yes. Hmm. Human plants. Superhuman. All this because of The blood plasma? That's correct. Notice these, closer to The source of the plasma. And these, Farther away. How many units Have we? Enough, I hope. Would you care to listen To them, professor Wilson? Yes, thank you. I should. Well? Almost like the wail Of a newborn child That's hungry. That's the way I would've Described it. - doctor? - yes, miss Nicholson? Would you mind very much If I-- Will you be needing Me anymore? No. Just finish Typing my notes. Return them to me. Let no one see them. Doctor, I think you Should get some sleep. There's too much to do. Your mind can't work If you're exhausted. My mind's still Perfectly clear. No, it isn't, Doctor. You aren't thinking Of what's happening There in the greenhouse. He's growing those Seeds in there, Using blood Just as you are. You've seen what One creature can do. Just imagine 1,000. I have imagined it. Arthur, what if That aircraft Came here not just To visit the earth, But to conquer it, To start growing Some kind Of horrible army, To turn The human race Into food for it? There are many things Threatening our world-- New stars, comets Shooting through space-- But those are theories. This enemy's right here. There are no enemies In science, professor, Only phenomena To study. We are studying one. Come in. - hello, pat. - hi. Nikki, I want To ask you something. Has anybody up here Been hurt lately, Anybody shot or stabbed Or operated on? No. That what-is-it In the greenhouse Has been Our first diversion. I brought 35 units Of plasma 2 months ago. What's become of it? Why do you Want to know? I wonder why they're not Giving it to Dr. Stern. They're giving him blood Transfusions instead of plasma. Two live donors. What's Carrington doing With 35 units of Blood plasma, Nikki? I guess you'd better Take a swing at my chin And have a look At those notes. I should be trying To stop you. So that's what He's been doing. Mm-hmm. Thanks. Thanks for Not stopping me. Pat, would you Remember something? He's tired. He hasn't slept since You found that thing. He's not thinking right. I know him. He doesn't Think the way we do anyway, But he's found something No one can understand. And until he can solve it, He'll-- you know, like a kid With a new toy, he'll-- Only this toy's Liable to bite him. Thanks again. Where's Dr. Carrington? I'm sorry, captain. I have no authorization To give you any-- I'm very busy. I know you're busy, doctor. I understand you've been Doing a bit of gardening. Where are they? This way to The nursery, pat. I don't tolerate Intrusions Into my laboratory. Please don't touch. This is what Your late colleagues Are doing In the greenhouse, Except this is A distinct improvement. What happened Was not my fault. We've read your notes. I think you should have Consulted us. I have the help I need. Your opinion hasn't been asked. It has by Captain Hendry. I've given it to him. I'll repeat it for you. We're facing something Unpredictably dangerous. The creature In the greenhouse Is obviously Multiplying itself In this Identical fashion. We don't know how Much it can multiply. It'll need more blood And will obtain What it needs. It's been imprisoned And is, therefore, harmless. How you can be sure Of our safety Or, more important, The safety of the world? Think of 1,000 such Creatures--10,000. Yes, it must be destroyed, This progeny, too. - no! - burn these. What about that thing In the greenhouse? You're talking like Frightened schoolboys. You're right. I'm frightened. Any destruction Would be an outrage, A betrayal of science. It may be a betrayal Of science, But it'll make me Sleep better If we get rid of it. I got a message through. Here's the answer. "Fogarty to Hendry. "Carrington informs me Martian alive. "You are directed To make effort "To keep it alive and Protect it against injury. "Under no circumstances Take action against it Until my arrival When weather permits." You have your orders, Captain Hendry. I consider them Sane and intelligent. - but, Tex, what about me? - not a thing, Scotty. - what do we do, pat? - get on that radio And try changing The army's mind. 'hey!" "Hey! It's me-- Eddie! What are you Doing in here? We can't take it Out there anymore. We can't guard the greenhouse From the outside. It's blowing so hard you can't See your hand in your face. Besides, it can Go through walls. How could it get through Corrugated iron walls? Use a can opener. Tell the others we're dropping The outside guard. Put your hand in some Ice water and rub it. - who's out in the corridor? - stone and Wilson, sir. Barnes, tell them they're The only ones on guard now. Tell them to watch it. Tex? Here I am. You won't be there long. We're dropping The outside guard. Come join the rest of them In the mess hall. I'll be alright. I got the door braced good And there's no Outside windows. Alright, if you Want to be brave. - well.. - pat, what are we-- Anybody around here Want some coffee? No, but you can come in. It's the only reason I brought it. I was hoping you Might ask me in. Who wants some? I could use a half. What were you Saying, Scotty? I was wondering-- That's enough, thanks. What happens if our Boyfriend gets lonely And starts Strolling around And ends up in here? What do we do? I've been trying to Figure that, too. - nothing seems to hurt it. - the $64 question-- What do you do With a vegetable? - boil it. - what did you say? Boil it, stew it, Bake it, fry it. Hey, that Makes sense. Cold doesn't bother it. Maybe Dr. Carrington Will ask it To crawl into A double boiler. Or maybe we could Borrow a flamethrower. Captain, I got a crazy idea. We got lots of kerosene. We could-- .3, .4-- Here's where We start cooking. .5, .6. Watch it, everybody! That Thing's out of the greenhouse. Be sure And stay together. What about throwing kerosene on It And setting it On fire? We can try. - here's a full can. - I'll take it, sir. We'll need something To put it in. Here's a pail. - 1.2. - we need one more. Pat, this one will Work alright. Watch that cigarette, Lieutenant. How we going to set it on Fire, rub 2 sticks together? - there's a pistol in my bag. - I'll get it. If it comes in, You wet it down. Mac, touch it off And don't miss. Be ready If it needs more. - I think you're right. - shut up. 1.3 now. You know how To shoot that thing? I saw Gary cooper In sergeant York. 1.4. Come here. Get in the corner. Now, hold this in front, Stay by the light switch. 1.5, 1.6, 1.7. What was that? It sounded like A window. 1.8. Turn off Those lights. 1.9. The needle's Hit the top. - Put the fire out! - I am! Watch it, captain! Block that window! Hey, Scotty! Here you are. This will make Your hand feel better. Thank you, bob. This ought to be Enough kerosene, pat. Good. Get it ready. - how's it coming, Barnes? - I'm gonna be okay. What makes me mad Is he didn't do it. I busted it falling Over the bunk. Listen, everybody, I want you all to stay here. We found a way to fight it, But we burned a room doing it. It didn't look like it Was hurt much. About as much effect As a good hot foot. It's sure to come back. We don't want to burn the place Once we're organized, We're going after it. It probably went to the Greenhouse, we'll start there. In the meantime, Stay here. Watch the door Into the hallway. And keep your eye On the geiger counter. Here are the fire Extinguishers. Who's your Electrical expert here? I can help. That's my line. Can you hook into the intercom System from the corridor? Easily. We'll take one From any other room. I can help You on that, too. Mac, we'll be in The radio room. Let us know When you're ready. - you alright? - yeah, I'd like to tag along. Haven't you had Enough? If I start Burning up again, Who'll put out the fire? We're very proud Of our captain. Ohh! Now, look, put one of The intercoms here. That'll take care of this end. Put another down here At the junction Of the corridor. Check if they work Through the mess hall. You said you'd use Kerosene again. - know anything better? - something hotter. We have enough cable to Reach the green house. - why not use electricity? - your lighting system? No, we can hook in A new transformer Dr. Chapman's been using. It's a high-voltage outfit And will give us Plenty of amps. - enough to burn him? - more than enough. Could you use leads And 2 poles? - if you insulate the poles. - sounds good. Bob, give him A hand. Come on, Tex, Go to work. Get anchorage If you can. Tell them The whole story. Tell them we're in bad shape. The sooner the better. Tell them to bring Hand grenades, mortars, Flamethrowers, anything They can think of. If I can't send a story, I'll shoot myself. Comb your hair First. What hair? Hey, say that again. Oh, Nikki, Not you, too. He's sensitive About his hair. - you, too. - I got hair. It doesn't make You any prettier. - no, your breath. - I'm sorry. He's sensitive About that, too. I've been very upset Lately. My-- Oh, you ninnies. Look. That's what I mean. You, too. It's getting cold In here. - the heat must be off. - it is off. It's not getting Any oil. See if it's the same Way across the hall. - where does it get oil from? - around behind. Outside. Pat, heat's off In the mess hall! No more oil coming in. It's off In there, too. - could the tank be empty? - filled day before yesterday. The main line Could be plugged. Better get outside And fix it. Probably run into our visitor. He's waiting for us to do that. We underestimate This guy. Trying to freeze Us out, huh? - that won't be hard. - it's down to 40 degrees now. It's 60 below Outside. How long will These rooms hold heat? - 1/2 hour at the most. - by then, we'll be stiff. If no one goes out won't it Think of something else? It'll think the same Thing I am-- That our only chance to keep Warm would be electricity. Heaters, blankets, Anything. It could break The circuit, Cut a line anywhere, Except at the source. Sure. The generator room. Get 'em all in there. Bring electrical stuff. Food, medicine, blankets, Warm clothes, Anything you can find. And, Mac, bring our flying Clothes. Most of them got burned, I'll see what I can salvage. We're hooked up To the transformer. - it's awful cold in here. - thing's turned the heat off. - that changes things. - what'll we do? I don't know. Next thing Will be the electricity We're gonna try and fight it From the generator room. Did you do a good job On the outside door? Houdini'd find it Tough getting in. He'll come through This corridor. Yeah, it's The only way left. Got any fence wire strong enough To take the voltage? - whole rolls of it. - that'll work. Lay it on the ground, Here. Run a lead overhead, One on each side. When it gets to the right spot Juice him. - I don't get you. - where's the fence? - give me those cutters. - what are you talking about? Rigging an electric Fly trap for him. - what do you mean fly trap? - get me a hammer and nails. Sure, sure. Get out of the way. Looks like the situation's Well in hand. I've given all the orders I want to give For the rest Of my life. If that were true, I'd ask you to marry me. - here's your coat. - shut up. Hammer and nails? - where do you want this? - in the generator room. Move along. Everybody, keep moving. Changed my mind. It's all off. Keep moving, everybody. I want another word With you. No time now, doctor. Move along. Make way here. Clear this out. Clear this place. - where are those cutters? - here they are. - here's your geiger counter? - in that barrel. Get down to The assembly room. If you get anything, Come running. - get me a pair of gloves. - use mine, Eddie. Leave enough to hook To the overhead wire. I got plenty. Here we are, Lieutenant. Yeah, that ought to Give us a ground. There she is, Captain. Down to 5 degrees now. Perfect for skiing. Better get rubber boots, Scotty. Why? Insulation when they Turn the juice on. Oh, yeah! Here's a pair Back here. Wait a minute. You won't need it. When it comes, go Back with the others. You don't belong Out here. I didn't belong at Alamein or Okinawa. I was just kibitzing. I also write a good obit-- Obituary to you. Just ignore me, Please. - captain Hendry. - go ahead. Just hooked this thing up, Checking to see if it works. Fine. Watch your Geiger counter. - Mac, did you hear that??? - every word. - I hope that's all I hear. - so do I. Captain, here's Another message. This one's relayed From Washington. "Fogarty to Hendry. "Use every means To protect lives, But take no steps Against your prisoner." - our prisoner. - there you are. You can't ignore orders from Your commanding officer. You can testify At my court-martial. You're doing more than Breaking army orders. You're robbing science Of the greatest secret. Knowledge is more important Than life. We've only one excuse For existing-- To think, to find out, To learn. What can we learn From that thing, Except a quicker way To die? It doesn't matter What happens to us. Nothing counts Except our thinking. We fought our way Into nature, We've split the atom. That sure made the world Happy, didn't it? We owe it to the brain Of our species To stand here and die Without destroying A source of wisdom. Captain Hendry-- Civilization Has given us orders. Get him out of here. Oh, you fool. You'll never Hurt it. 'Go ahead.' I'm getting a reaction From the geiger counter. What's your reading? - only .2, but steady. - watch it. Tell us any change. Mac, anything your way? - not a glimmer, pat. - watch it. Here's the Operating switch. How can it get cold So quick? Keep moving around. You won't get too cold. - it must be zero. - it was. Next stop's 5 below. "Come on, Mr. Martian.? Get some nice Scotch blood. 100 proof. Nothing like it For babies. Irina To cut it out. No, let him go on. I like goose pimples. They keep me warm. Did you get a picture of that Thing when it was on fire? Nah. I shot one while I was falling backward Probably got the ceiling And my own big feet. Captain Hendry, Captain Hendry. Going up a little. .4 now. Hang on. Mac, any change? Just the same, Only colder. It means he's coming By the mess hall. Excuse me, sir. I got an idea. Here we go again. Our new boy's Pretty smart. He might See these wires, Sit down, And think it over. If he thinks too long, We're cold meat. What if we met him There by the junction? Let him see us there And chase us here? Yes. The less light, The better. Turn off this light And this one here. Don't say I'm right. Captain Hendry, Going up--.8 now. I'm getting Some too, pat.? It's showing here Now. Both of you, back here. Come a-running. I'm halfway there. If you speed up That generator, - can you get more out of it? - no harm to try. Bill, you and Tex go. Nikki, you, too. - pat, can't I-- - no. Good luck to you. What's the matter? I was just wishing We'd tested this thing. What if we haven't Enough voltage? Just keep swinging At its arms. - 1.2. - it's on its way. I got a worry. Report from the Front, captain. McPherson Has a worry. - this is no joke. - what? What if he can Read our minds? He'll be mad when He gets to me. 1.4. Keep moving around, You guys. Keep it quiet. Ste The first execution I ever covered-- Ruth Snyder And Judd gray. Did you get a picture Of that, Scotty? No. They didn't Allow cameras. 1.6. Going up fast. Don't move Till he sees us. Give him a chance To get a look. Leave me room To reach that switch. Stay away from the walls When he hits the juice. Everybody got Rubber boots on? 1.8. Shh! I heard Something. It's getting Near the top. Alright, ease back. - what the-- - the juice is off! Pat! Carrington's Turned off the generator! Bob, bring a flashlight. Eddie, hold him off As long as you can. Watch out. He's got a gun. Keep away. Keep away. I won't allow you To destroy-- "Turn on That generator!? "Get back here, Eddie!" Eddie, get back here! Stay away from that wire! Listen, I'm your friend. I have no weapons. I'm your friend. You're wiser than I. You must understand what I'm trying to tell you. Don't go any farther. They'll kill you. They think you mean To harm us all. I want to know you, To help you. You're wiser Than anything on earth. Use that intelligence. Look, know what I'm Trying to tell you. I'm not your enemy. I'm a scientist. I'm a scientist Who's trying-- Wait till he's right In the middle of it. He's got to be on That walk, captain. Arrrrr! Wait till he gets Right in the middle. That's enough. Turn it off. Let it go. We don't want Any part of it left. You can get a picture now, Scotty. This'll take a minute To warm up. Is there any reason now Why I can't send my story? Only take 5 minutes. I guess it's okay.
