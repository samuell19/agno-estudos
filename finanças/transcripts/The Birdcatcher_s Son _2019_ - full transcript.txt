THE BIRDCATCHER'S SON Father! Såmal has come! Father! Father! Go home. I'll take over. Såmal has come. Esmar! How nice. Is something wrong? So you don't approve of your pretty wife's hospitality? You have a wise wife. Yes, which is why she chose me. But she thought you could provide a decent life for her... You shall be paid. This year, just as you were last year. And every previous year. But not for another week. So why are you here? I need the land myself. Your lease expires next year, but I will buy you out today for what it might take you three years to earn. Now you can buy something beautiful for Johanna. Our home is not for sale. And according to the law our lease can be extended for 39 years as soon as my son is born. A son? Do you really believe that yourself? Yes, this time it will be a son. Johanna, will it be a son? -Will it be a son, Johanna? -Yes. There, you see. Then my son will take over the lease. And then his son. And then his son. And then his son! And then his son! And his son! And his son! And his son! That shut him up! You and me, Johanna! You and me! Esmar, Esmar! Don't be smug! God punishes those who believe themselves superior! We've respected God for all these years! Now it's time for Him to respect us! But wait, wait! Think of our baby! I think about him all the time. Esmar...! -What is it? -What are you waiting for? What? Fetch Anna! -Hurry up! -Yeah, yeah, yeah. Come on, Anna! Breathe, breathe, breathe. I'm never going to have a baby... I was just... Everything went well. She is just as pretty as her mother. I really believed. My body was telling me, but... Forgive me. How the hell could you do this to me? I can do everything a boy can do. I know. Do you think we'll be able to sell anything today? -You think so? -Yes. -Is this a good place? -Yes, it is. Esmar! Vigdis! Please, could you...? It's hard for me. I know. How is Johanna? Her time is near, isn't it? It's all over. She is very pretty. She will make you proud. Why can't I bear a son? Perhaps you can't. Or perhaps it's Esmar who can't give you a son. What do you mean? Certain men and women don't go well together. I have a book written by a respected doctor in Paris. I told you you'd get it in good time. If you don't trust me, count it while I'm here. Why the arrogance? I know it was a girl. Give it some thought. My offer still stands, today. But not tomorrow. Cheers. We'll have a son before the year is out. You're only bringing unhappiness upon Johanna. Deuces! Dear God... Help us. -Father? -Yes? Are you still sad because it was a girl? No. I'm happy for you and your sisters. I can do everything a boy can do. Yes, you can. But that won't help against Såmal and the law. I went to Livia's today. She's read in some foreign book that nature is like that. Certain men and women just don't go well together. Some can't have children together, others can only have daughters or sons. It's like with our sheep. Does the book tell whose fault it is? It's not always the same. It is difficult to know. Did she say what we can do? Why don't you answer me? There are only two ways. One way is for you to look for another wife and try with her. No, Johanna. You are my wife and you always will be. And the other way? It would be best for you to discuss this with Livia yourself. Good night. -Today I'm going alone. -But why? I'm going to do something that's not for children. -I need you to help me bake today. -I want to be with Father! Come. Esmar! Esmar, are you standing there sleeping? -Where's your daughter today? -She's helping Johanna. The French boat will be difficult to beat this year. I wanted to ask you about that. We need one more man for our boat. No, when I say I've stopped, I've stopped. With you in the boat we can win. I'm too old... You're a man in his best years and strong as an ox Are you hard of hearing? I do apologise. Esmar! I don't need anything from you today. We're serving fish tonight. Johanna told me you talked about a book. Yes? Could we have a talk? Come up to my inn today after you've finished. He's asking if you have whiter skins? One moment, he'll have a look. It should be like this. Feel it. You need to know this if you're ever going to marry. I will never get married. I'm going to stay with Father. Off with you! Go help your sister with the algae! And when Father comes home you can be sure I'm going to tell him. Be off now! Looking at you gives me such pleasure. We've already paid you. Esmar will be home soon. Is this a life for the island's most beautiful woman? It's the life I've chosen. There are rumours that he is looking for a woman to bear him a son. You're lying. It's good that you're faithful to your husband. -But what if he isn't faithful to you? -I know he is. I wouldn't want my Johanna to be left all alone one day. I'm no longer "your Johanna". That was ten years ago. Give Esmar his freedom, so that he can get the son he needs. And set yourself free... ...for the good life with me that we deserve. We? Yes, and your daughters. I'll take care of you all. How does that sound? Dreadful. -What would be "dreadful"? -Being anywhere near you. I've asked you for forgiveness. I'm asking again. I was too rough with you... I went too far. Would you please go? Am I not good enough? Am I not worthy of you? -What's wrong with me? -This is what's wrong with you. One day you will beg me to be mine. Never. Livia? Livia? -Good day. -Good day. -Is Livia in the house? -She's in there. Esmar! Stop! -I...am sorry. -Welcome. We've living in exciting times, Esmar. There are so many well-educated people who can explain so much about how and why we do things. We are all just human beings. And we look almost the same underneath our clothes. There's a big world out there, but the same things happen here as well as there. That's what this book is about. It says so right there. Does it say... ...how you make a son? How can we be sure? Nothing is certain, but if you do what I suggested to Johanna there might be more hope. How? What did you say to Johanna? What did she say to you? That you have a book where it is written what we should do. About what Johanna should do. But you must agree about another man. No matter what happens in the world, my happiness is in God's hands. Amen. Good night. Why hasn't Father come home? He'll be home. In a while. Go to sleep and he'll be here when you wake up. Are you and Father angry with one another? No, what makes you think that? You don't embrace one another anymore. -We don't? -No. Then we'll have to do better. Yes, please do. Good night. -How are you? -Fine... Good... Esmar, come with me... Alma, no. -But... -No. Time to go home now. I am in command! Do as I say! We are going that way! Hell! Esmar! Esmar! Esmar, what happened? Forgive me, Johanna. Forgive me. -Forgive me. -Yes, yes, yes. Forgive me. There! Off with you! -Is Father very ill? -He's just a bit tired. He is very tired. You get what you deserve. And why did I drink? Why didn't you tell me? It's Livia's suggestion, not mine. She wants to help us. But we have to decide together. It can't be done if just one of us say yes. -Do you want to? -No. But what is our choice? It's our last chance. But no one can be sure what it will be...? Yes, we can. If we do it the same way we always do. But how can we meet this man and look him in the eyes every day for the rest of our lives? It needn't be someone from here. It can't be just anyone. It has to be a strong and handsome man. -Someone like me? -Someone like you. -It won't be easy... -No, not easy. -But sensible. -But sensible. -You're happy again, aren't you? -Yes, we're happy. Can't you embrace one another then? Run down there and find good seats. No thanks, not for me. I don't have a high tolerance for that. -No, he doesn't. Really. -You needn't pour it down your throat. But a drop of sherry is good for opening your mind on a day like this. Cheers. May we find a suitable fellow. Should he be a certain sort of a man? -He should be like me. -And he mustn't be from around here. Then today there will be many coming from far away, who will never return. Choose the one you want and I'll make the arrangements. Livia! Dear Livia. -Good luck. -Thank you. -What are you laughing at? -Am I laughing? Yes. You're going like this. No. I'm not very comfortable. It's rather hard. I don't have a sheepskin. My dear Faroe Islanders. Denmark looks upon the Faroese with a father's pride. You are strong and diligent, both on land and at sea. But the world around us is fraught with uncertainty. What does the future hold for these beautiful green islands? You can keep a level head, though. It is you who steer the boats in today's race, as you have done many times before. But every boat needs a captain who stays the course. and you can count on Denmark to be the captain who steers you all to victory. Denmark will never fail you. And with that promise, may this year's race begin. May the best boat win! Hurray! Hurray! Hurray! Hurray! Have you seen anyone here you find suitable? Yes, we have. -That fellow over there. -Which one? That man. He is a good man! -Who? -Your captain. Armand? You said we could choose whoever we wanted. Yes, but... And if he's good enough for you, he's good enough for Johanna. Isn't that right, Johanna? He will do just fine. And when were you thinking this should take place? We're here now. We may as well be done with it. I agree with you. But I do have to ask him first. He might not be willing to... That's right. You are to arrange it. That's what you promised. Could we wait in your apartment? Now? Maybe Alma can take care of the children? Are you serious? But Cherie... Is this really want you want? No! But, yes. I have promised to try and help them. Esmar once saved my life. This may save his. But t's not certain that it will be a boy. -Even if I... -I know. So do they. But this is their last chance. I will do it... ...but only because I love you so much. Take good care of my captain. He likes this very much. You are... -You are... -You are ready to meet the captain. "Welcome. This is a great honour for me." Cheers. -You needn't pour it down your throat. -Hush. Livia! Thank you. -Now it's all in God's hands. -Yes. Thank you. Thank you. -Good night. -Good night. Johanna and Esmar asked me if they can do something for you in return? If it is a son, they could name him Francois. Francois? Without gossip taking off? You are very wise. You know what's best. Promise me you will write and let me know how things turn out. I promise. When will you come back again? Don't be too long. I will come to you whenever I can. You know that. Såmal. Welcome. So very nice of you to come. Now we've done our part. And now you shall do yours. You must sign the lease over to their son for 39 more years. Such is the law. Finally another man in the house. Yes, you are going to be a real man. Johanna and I are deeply grateful for your help. Thank you from a proud mother and a proud father. And a proud Denmark. I know that there is some mistrust over our governing. But Denmark is a father you can trust. -A toast to Denmark. -And to the son. Why, by Jove... And to the son! Good luck. Is there anything we can do to repay the captain? You could name the boy Francois. It translates to "The Frenchman". But with such a name, what will people say? There is a name here similar to it. What do you think about "Frans"? Frans will be good. Tell your captain that our son will be named Frans. -Will he be happy with that? -He will be very happy. I will stay for a while. The Governor's carriage is waiting for you. But that is far too generous. Father Denmark takes care of his children. What are you doing? Are you trying to bring unhappiness upon all of us? Is something amiss? I think his stomach must be upset. I'll carry him around for a while. Now you rock him like this until he falls asleep. House and land go from father to son. That's the law. We just have to accept it. Frans saved us, but he doesn't know anything. He needs for us to teach him everything. He needs you. "Frans - Francois. He's a little captain. He resembles you very much. When will you come?" Wait! Excuse me, may I send this with you? Yes, I will pass it along. Here you are. Thank you. Send my regards to the Governor. He is nice. He has your eyes, but what has he got from Esmar? You've had yours. Leave us alone. Did you get what you needed from the captain? How dare you? There is talk that you rowed out to the ship. Yes, Livia invited us for dinner with her friend. Isn't it ever enough for you? Will you poison our lives with gossip now? -I could have given you a son. -Stop it. Esmar and I have a son. Everyone knows that Såmal hates losing. Who believes him? I feel like everyone is staring at Frans and me. If someone saw us row out to the ship, so what? People know that Armand and I have a relationship and you are my friends. What did the captain think of the name "Frans"? He hasn't replied yet. How are things with Esmar? We are fine, but... He is still not coming to me at night. He needs to be friends with himself again. Wait for him. Suddenly one night... I will give you one of my lovely soaps. Choose one. That usually sets things off, doesn't it? What is it? Smoke? No, it smells like... ...something nice. I don't know. Something different. Like... Like... Something like this? I'm coming! I'm first! -What fine children we have. -Yes. What goes through your head when you look at Frans like that? I have seen you do it sometimes. -I wish he was our son. -But he is. No. He is your son. Yours and the captain's. -What are you doing? Did you hit a girl? -She hit him! -Sigrun fights with Frans all the time. -Why do I always get the blame? No one is arguing with anyone, understand? -You might want to apologise. -Should I? Get up! Johanna! Run along to Father and ask him if we will have dinner with Livia today. Your son looks more and more like his father. Leave Frans alone. He is old enough to understand when someone tells him who his father is. -What do you want, Såmal Johanneson? -You, Johanna. You will never have me. And stop talking about Frans. In return, I would like for you to come to me one night every month. If he can share you with the captain, then he can share you with me. You will never have that. Stop talking nonsense about us. If you are wise, you will come to me. Think how hard it'll be for Frans to hear the truth now. -What did he want? -He is just spiteful. He will die alone. -What did he want? -Are we to live his life or ours? This is for you. Good. Bastard! Bastard! Bastard! Leave him alone! Bastard! Bastard! Bastard! What's happened? Who is my father? I am, of course. Who says anything else? They call him a bastard. -Of course he is your father. -Yes, and Johanna is your mother. -Yes. -And these are your sisters. Nevermind the mean children's talk. We are together. We are a family, Frans. And I am your father. Do you understand? No. I am sorry. No, like this. And your feet wide apart. And lean backwards. -Was it too windy? -Give the birds their food. -What's happened? -Come. -What's happened? -He has returned. Who? Your French captain. What do you say to that? -But maybe you think it's good news? -Why do you say that? I saw how you touched him when you two left his cabin. It was just like the way you touch me afterwards. And that look. What are you afraid of? Good. Armand! Mon capitaine. Madame Livia. Madame Marie-Therese. -My wife. -Delighted. Delighted, Madame. And what can I do for you? Ever since I received your letter telling me that it was a son and that he resembles me I've wondered: What does he look like? Does he have a good life? I would very much like to meet him and see for myself. Could you assist me with this? May I offer you something to drink? Madame? Thank you. That depends on what you have. -Everything. -Is that true? -A glass of Chateau d' Yquem? -Of course. Which year would you like? The one that you prefer yourself, Madame. Of course. But Madame, what about my husband? I know what he wants. -I will return very shortly. -Where are you going? -I need to speak with her alone. -Why? About what? Marie-Therese. My dear. Trust me. -You're angry. -Why didn't you write and tell me? I didn't know when I could make a trip here to meet him. And when the chance arose, I realised that we could travel faster than a letter. About the two of you! Forgive me. I didn't want to hurt you. And you think your silence hasn't? You came here four times a year and then suddenly - just gone! I was a coward. But I've thought about you every single day. Oh! Thank you very much! What do you want from the boy? Isn't it natural for a father to want to see his son? That wasn't the agreement! I didn't even know if there would be a child! What do you think Esmar and Johanna will say? And all the neighbours? If the old rumours start circulating they'll soon have the landowner after them igen! We're leaving in two days. The meeting must, of course, be arranged discreetly. That's why I'm begging you for your help. Your wife is expecting her wine. What are you two drinking? Bordeaux. Armand and I always drink Bordeaux. Cheers. My name is Frans. What's yours? Livia! Be careful of the eggs. One of the birds is almost tame now! Come! In a moment. First I need to speak with your mother and father. -They're inside. -This isn't something for children. Shall I take the eggs inside? I'll be right out. The captain has returned. He would like to meet Frans. What good could come of that? Sometimes people want to sort out things from their past. To find answers to questions and give themselves some peace of mind. For us it can only mean worries. Doesn't he understand that? He helped us with something important. It feels selfish to refuse such a simple wish. -Let him meet Frans. -Maybe you would like to meet him. No, Esmar. This is best done by you alone. We're going to meet a man who helped your mother and I a long time ago. We're going to greet him and his wife, have a few polite words with them, and then go home. They are refined people from France, where they bow more than we do. Såmal. Frans. You did well. Esmar. Doing business with the Frenchman, are you? So that is why you named him Frans? Wait outside. Mind your own business. -Father? Why am I named Frans? -You had to be called something. Everything went well, didn't it? Now it's finished. -What's troubling you? -I don't know. I'm just worried. It feels like the calm before the storm. Tomorrow all your worries will go sailing away with the ship. -Do you promise that? -Yes. - Mon Capitaine. -May I have another glass of wine? Of course. A glass? And Madame? She's been asleep for hours. -Oh, really? -Yes, she sleeps quite a lot. Oh, my poor Capitaine . Strange how things can turn out. But we are very happy. Congratulations. But then why do you look so unhappy? Do I? Yes, Armand. I couldn't stay here, Livia. I did consider it for a while. I wanted to. But my whole life, everything I own, family and friends, they are all in Paris. It's going to be cold out here soon. Should we go in to my apartment? Aren't you permitted to speak with other women? Okay...as always. Livia? Livia? Livia? Livia? Livia? Good morning. -What time is it? -Don't worry. She'll be asleep for a few more hours. Life is very short. There's no time to be unhappy. I can make you happy. You know that. Stay here with me. I'm not the master of my life. If I have no heir, my family loses all its property to my cousin's family. Is she carrying your child? -She can't bear children. -Well, that's that then. That's why I'm here. Yes. Frans is my son and therefore my heir. And I'm begging for your help. Are you mad? If you will help me to get Frans then I can divorce Marie-Therese and come fetch you. Then it can be you and me, Livia. Armand? Calm down, Madame. He's out for a morning walk. I'm sure he'll return soon. Good morning. Tea or coffee? Good morning. Tea, please. Excuse me, but is something wrong? You still love him, don't you? I'm not stupid. I can see it. He's told me about the two of you. He is a wonderful man. And you are still a beautiful woman... ...despite your age. I realise what a big loss it was for you when he chose me. But that's life. Love is cruel. We have a very good marriage. And I respect what you had together. And that there is still...a friendship. Do you understand what I mean, Madame? Don't be afraid. I will ask Father to let you live. Livia! Look how tame he is now. Look at his eyes. It's as if he understands that we are talking about him. Do you hear that? His mother and father are calling for him. You had better... He would like to talk with you about his son. -Frans is our son. -That is true, in a way... -Wasn't Johanna the one who bore him? -No one doubts that. But there's talk again about who his father is. Såmal has seen to that. Who listens to what he says? Many, now that the captain has returned. If he can prove that the captain is Frans' father, which we know is the truth ...then the new lease is invalid. How could Såmal prove it? He takes you and the captain to court, and you both must testify under oath. Frans has to appear with you and with the captain. The judge makes his decision. If things go badly, you will lose both Frans and your lease. What has the captain asked you to tell us? Frans will attend the best schools in Paris and become the heir that he must have. In return, he will buy your house and land from Såmal at the price he is asking and give it all to you. He promises that Frans will have a good life with him. This is Frans' big opportunity for a better life. -What's wrong? -Let me go! What's wrong? Frans! -I want to speak with the Governor. -Yes, he was on our side. This is something quite different. He's not a judge. He knows the law. Does a Frenchman have more rights than someone born here? Whose side are you on, Livia? Never ask that question again or you will lose your best friend. What do you want? -Why is Frans so angry? -Is he angry? He was crying and he struck me and ran off. When I ran into him he was very cheerful and wanted to show me a tame bird. He was bitten again. He tries so hard to tame them, but it's impossible. Will you come with me? Forgive me for what I said. I know you are on our side. Madame Livia. Esmar. To what do I owe this honour? It is because I recall the words of His Honourable Governor: "Denmark is a father you can trust." My Johanna and I are most humbly asking Father Denmark for help. Your whole body is trembling. What is this all about? Our son, Frans. I told you it would be like that. The Governor cannot bypass the law. A dispute regarding paternity must be decided by the court. Which will take both Frans and our lease from us? You can swear to tell the truth, but then choose to lie anyway. And ask Johanna and me to lie. People do that before the court. And if you ask us, we'll certainly try to the best of our ability. But can you lie, Esmar? Frans! Frans! Frans! What are you saying? Isn't Father your father? But you will always be my brother. He says "I assure Esmar of my full respect. I consider the two of us Frans' two fathers. No one more and no one less." He can come and visit you whenever he wants. I have to do this with Johanna. You're stealing bread like a thief. Why are you doing that in your own home? I just wanted to sample it. Do that. Then put it back. -It's for the birds. -Fresh bread? Are you mad, girl? This is their bread. Do you aim to spoil the birds like Frans does? -Is he out there now? -No... -Where is he then? -I don't know. -You said he was angry? -Yes. Do you know why? Did Frans hear what we grownups were talking about today? He heard every word! Oh dear God! But Johanna! He's gone! Frans has run away from home! He was standing right outside the window and heard everything! Come with me. This isn't easy for a mother. How can you be in love with a man like that? Armand is a very fine man. A man who first gives us a son and then takes him away? That's only done by a monster! He is even worse than Såmal! He needs an heir himself and his wife cannot bear children. -He didn't know at that time. -Then he'll have to find another wife! Oh yes, indeed. Just as Esmar could have done. You... You tricked us into this! Thank you, Johanna. Thank you. Yes, I was trying to get you out of a hopeless bind. But of all the men here, you chose my captain! And now you run the captain's errands for him! Is that how you hope to win him back? Stop it! Either we part with Frans.... ...or both Frans and the farm. And what do we do then? I'm tired. I'm old. I'm incapable of starting all over with two empty hands. Frans will have a life we could never give him. I want him to have that life. No, I'm not going with you. You don't care at all how Frans is doing. Alone and sad and cold somewhere out there! You couldn't care less! Shame on you! Please open it. This is Esmar's lease for all the years ahead. And double the amount due. You get it all here and now. I've counted it. Denmark guarantees the amount to be correct. In return, you recognise Esmar as Frans' father and forever forego bringing action against Esmar in a court of law. That's what this says. That is Esmar's signature. After you write your signature next to his, this fortune is yours. Is Frans really worth this much? What plans have the lot of you concocted? That does not concern you. Nor does what you do with your money concern us. This contract binds both parties to silence. And the contract will remain in the Governor's keeping. Are we in agreement? Well, Esmar... The captain has bought you a son. The rest is your affair. I want nothing more to do with it. The rest is silence. I will return the carriage this evening. Thank you for all your help, sir. God and Denmark be with you. Farewell. -"Et ravoir." - Au revoir. Oh, right. Hell... Adieu, adieu. Yes. I saw. I'm not angry. I'm happy about what you're doing for your brother. The two of you will always be close throughout your lives. Mother, how can you and Father even think of giving up Frans? We've shielded you as a child for too long. Life is not just bright and good. It's time you knew how everything fits together. Come, sit down. -I need to speak with you inside. -Is Frans back home? I'll explain. You go. They need to have a talk. -What is it? -Mother has told me everything. What have you done? It's too important to keep quiet about. And Frans already knows. It makes no difference. It is how it is. Where is Frans? -Why are you giving up without a fight? -I've done what I could. It's his word against ours in court. We can win. What kind of winning is built on a lie? So Frans is Father's son? A lie to save his family. -Who could find fault with that? -You're a child... ...and you don't understand. The subject is closed. The matter has been decided. If you let Frans down, you let me down too. If you give Frans away, I'll leave you. Listen to what our daughter is saying. So do my children make the decisions in this family? Don't you want to hold your family together? Why do you go behind my back and throw dust in a child's eyes... -...when there's no hope. -Father, there is always hope. No! The contract has been signed. The captain is waiting. Where is Frans? Father has sold my brother. Where is Frans? -Shall I talk with her? -Come with me. Tell them to wait here. Please, wait here. Everything will be properly arranged. Do we know what we are doing to Johanna and Esmar? We know that we have to do it for us. That's why we're here. Cherie , we both know that. But deciding something in Paris and doing it on the Faroe Islands are two different things. Not at all. They are two sides of the same coin. -Deciding to do it and carrying it out. -To you. That's how you think. I don't. I live in the present. Can we live with it? Will we be happy with this, Armand? It has nothing to do with happiness. We have no choice. This hurts me just as much as it does you. But I must have a son as my heir. Or do you want to live in poverty for the rest of your life? Please, Marie-Therese, don't let your emotions jeopardise this. Frans! Come up now! Frans! Come up or I'm coming down to fetch you! You needn't be so harsh. He needs to know he doesn't get to decide. I do! Frans, get up here! Calm, calm. -No! Stay where you are! -Oh, good heavens! Stay still! Don't move! Don't move! -I'll go down and get him. -No, no, no. Don't go down to him. He's not afraid of me. I'm going down. You? Who's never set foot off the edge of a cliff? I'm going down. Oh, hell! I once had a son. He was the same age as you when... My husband was a merchant and we spent all our time travelling between Sweden and other countries. We lived on our boat. And we got caught in a storm just off the coast not far from here. The boat sank. My husband and son went down with it... I was rescued by some fishermen. One of them was Esmar. And that's how I came here. But I never acquired a new family of my own. When you children were born, you became like my children too. You became like a son to me. Mon petit Capitaine. Will you help me? Yes, I'll never let you down. I will write to you all the time and come to visit as often as I can. Didn't you say you would help me? Yes, doing everything I can. But in regard to who your father is, no one can help you. I so wish that you could understand. -Is it time to go soon? -Just a little while longer. I truly want to thank you for making it possible to do this in such a calm manner. But I understand how difficult this is for you as a mother. You, Madame, can never have a child. You will never understand. She thanks you, Madame, for understanding her feelings. I can see by looking at her that she isn't grateful. Please translate it correctly. The madame cannot have children... Who is to say that my feelings have less value? I am going to do everything I can to give Frans a good and secure life with us. Frans! Get in! Frans! Frans! Frans! Do something! -No, keep on rowing. -What are you doing? -It's enough now. -Turn back! It's all over.
