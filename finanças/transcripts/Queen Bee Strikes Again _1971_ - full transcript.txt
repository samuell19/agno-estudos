He looks like the straitlaced type. That's why he must be lecherous! Trust me. Hi Mister, please can you give me a hundred yen? A hundred? I don't have the money to buy a cup of coffee. Please, Mr. President. I'm not a president. I'm an executive. If you give me a hundred yen, I'll introduce you to a good girl. Here. She's actually from a famous college and a rich family. I have to get 2,000 yen today. So, how about 2,000? Look here: I'm young and juicy. You won't be disappointed. You'll never get another chance like this, huh? Stop your nonsense! What kind of sense does it make to sell your body for 2,000 during the daytime? 2,000 is fine? Okay, let's go then. Where? That car over there. This is Ms. Sawako Hayashi. I'm a sophomore English major from Konan College. Mister, please get in. Mister, can you drive? Yes, I can. Then please drive. - Okay. Can you take my bag? This is my car so don't worry about anything. Have fun. Oh, I have to close the trunk. Close the door on your side too. Don't hurry. We've plenty of time. Mr. Executive... I'm gonna make you a drink that'll give you lots of energy. You want an egg in it? Sure. Should I drink this all without breaking the egg? Yes. You're such a sweet girl. It's working already. Yes, yes. Let's do it. Wait a minute. I don't like 'ordinary' sex. I want something more exciting. Okay. I'll use all my best techniques on you. Ah, I'm so happy! Let's start with this position... Damn it. He's only got 3,200 yen. This old banger is done for. We have no luck at all. Saseko, the cars you've stolen are all useless. Yeah. Hurry up and fix it. Ah, what the hell is all this smoke? So much smoke! Nothing we can do. We can't fix this. We should steal another one rather than try to fix this mess. Right there. Which key'll work? Hurry up, Saseko. Not this one. Come on... No, nothing works. Then, let's break the window. Let's do it. So heavy. 1... 2... You stealing a car? Do you realize how much trouble you can get in for doing that? I'll keep quiet if you get on my bike. Get on, I said. Or do you want us to call the police? Wait. Boss... All right, let's have a ride. Smart girl. Stop it. Let me go. I will, after you let me do this. Stop, you bastard! Let me go! Bastard! You animal! Ouch... Ouch... Stay back if you don't wanna get hurt. You think you can scare us with that thing? Don't underestimate us. Reiko, we didn't report you for stealing a car... so listen to what we have to say. Stay away. Jiro! What happened? These bastards are trying to take advantage of us. That makes us mad. What are you, some kind of bike gang? None of your business. What the hell? Let's see who's stronger! Excellent. So you wanna fuck with me, Jiro of the Hokushin Association? Hokushin? Never heard of it. You idiot! Bastard! Jiro, stop. That's enough to teach them a lesson. Don't ever fuck with us again. Jiro, sleep with me. What? I have no other way to thank you right now. I don't wanna go make money... so sleep with me. You wanna be my girl? I don't think so. You didn't... I've slept with countless women, but none like you. I'll definitely become the leader of the Akimoto Group. You'd better stay with me now. What can a woman do? I'm a woman who doesn't wanna beg anybody for anything. I'd dissolve our Athens Gang rather than take orders. Reiko, I'm serious. Don't underestimate me. Stop being pushy if you don't wanna get hurt. Fine, but I'll definitely make you mine some day. What's so funny? Don't think I'm yours after sleeping with me a couple of times. We're even now. Boss! Who's that kid? She wants to join us. I thought she has what we need, so I brought her to you. Your name? Yuko Itogawa. I wanna join the Athens Gang. Boss, please let me in. You're a virgin? Yuko, you gotta lose that quickly... by yourself. Use your finger. With your fingers, break your hymen! It's actually easier that way. Your hymen can even be broken when you do sports. No big deal. I did mine myself too. I'm saying it's better than getting it broken by a guy. Okay, I'll do it myself. You need some lube. You did it? Yeah. I just got a little blood on my finger. I feel released, Boss. That's good. There are women like me, who lost theirs through tragedy. Tragedy? Being raped by many guys. When I was thirteen, I watched my mom having sex. They were like animals. I was shocked. Then I started sniffing glue. I was raped by some college guys when I was high on glue in the park. Boss, I'm sorry to hear that. Silly, don't be. By the way, get rid of that ugly uniform. We'll find you some better clothes. Oh, I like that one! Welcome, how do you like that? Here, look at this. That's pretty. Come with me. I saw you shoplifting. Big deal. Everybody does it! So go ahead and check if I stole anything. Have you searched everywhere? What are you doing? If you don't find anything, just wait and see what happens. Don't forget that when you search. Okay... so, due to our policy, we will have to search... Hey, you! You old wimp, can't you even stand up any more? Boss, I can't believe what I'm seeing. I've never seen a woman's private parts this close up. Hey, don't get too close; this woman is crazy. Look how you humiliated my little sister. What are you gonna do about it? Sorry... Look what you did! Please give me a minute. It's not much but it's to show we're sorry. I'll take it. Mister, what about the fee for seeing me naked? Fee? 5,000 yen for each of you. So, 10,000 yen! That much? She's shown you the most beautiful body you've ever seen. Hurry up. You suck. What about you? Take it out. Me too? Of course! You idiot! Not that! What a pervert. Miss, you forgot this... A new recruit has to stay here for a while... ...so you can get along with everyone quickly and work for our group. Okay? You have to memorize our Athens Gang rules as soon as possible too. Mayumi, tell her. First, obey the Boss' orders unconditionally. Second, no member should date or be manupilated by any particular man. Third, keep our secrets, no matter what. Anyone failing to do so receives the death penalty. Fourth, all members' consent is necessary for quitting the gang. Fifth, members should strive for power, courage, and strength. That's all. So behave accordingly to our rules. You'll be strictly punished if you break any of these rules, understood? Yes. Have some. Hi! Jun! Hiromi, Moko, Saseko, are you doing well? Yeah. Thank you for your work. Welcome back. Boss, this is Jun, who went to reform school and used to be a Sukeban. Nice to meet you. Please receive my greeting. I apologize if it does not sound right. I'm originally from Kanto. I'm leading the Athens Gang right now. I am Sukeban Reiko. I'm known as Extortioner Jun. I've been through reform school twice for robbery and extortion. Nice to meet you. It's not a nice place, but please come in. Well, this gang has become complicated with rules and everything, huh? I thought we gathered here because we hated rules. Jun! Hiromi. I missed you. Jun, you got out quickly. Yeah, adults are dumb and easy to manipulate. I pretended to behave and be sorry for what I did for a while... ...then they sent me to the review board and here I am. Saseko, how are we doing lately? No, no luck at all. Well, what kind of Sukeban is that... ...if she can't give members a comfortable life? No one ever said I was not qualified as a boss. We're doing fine. Our Hokushin Association is just one step away from becoming a real gang. We are only waiting for the Akimoto Group to hold a ceremony for us... ...that will officially makes us part of them. Listen, don't ever forget the fact that we can only become men as gangsters! Yes, sir. Good morning. Long time, no see. We'll have your payment soon. Okay. You've increased your membership, haven't you? Yes, it's about 30 men now. I see. I'll bring your name up with my boss sometime. Thank you for your kindness. By the way, I heard that a female gang called Athens has been acting up lately. Yes, they've come to greet me sometimes. Idiot! Bring them to greet us first! Akikomo Kogyo I'll visit the chairman of the Hanshin United group now. I wonder if their boss will live longer than six months. It'll be a mess after he dies. The Kiriga and Yamazaki groups are our competitors. The others should be no problem. That's why we have to make the chairman happy. Wrap two million yen for me. Doi, the flow of time these days is fast. Ten years in the past is like a year now. Without money, honor and humanity can be lost in a second. Five years ago... I killed the boss of the Sekimoto Gang. Was what I did really helpful to our group? Of course it was. That's how we could join Hanshin United with the chairman's recommendation. Listen Doi, you've got the mindset of having no fear of death. You should actually be in the position to lead our group. But now I need you to take care of our financing. So just lay low for a while. Here is two million, Boss. I've prepared 100,000 yen for Brother. Brother, here. You must've had a hard time in prison. Have you seen Rie yet? No. I wanted to help her out while you weren't around... ...since she had to raise her kid too. But she found a partner quickly and opened up a club called Rie. A kid? Lovers don't need words Lovers don't need tears either Lovers have one heart They understand each other at a glance Even if you tan your skin red... You can't hide the love in your heart Understand the meaning of the moment of love Sway, sway, sway... Sway in love Mr. Doi, I'll definitely join Akimoto someday. I wanna become a man like you. I'm not an honorable man like you think. Of course you are: you're a well-known hitman in Kansai. Stop it. That doesn't mean anything. A guy who can gather money is more useful nowadays. Jiro, a strong arm or a good reputation can move nothing. Mr. Doi, I'm a man who's only useful in the yakuza world. Well, you're just like I was when I was young. Welcome. How old is your kid? How old? You have a kid, right? You're not the father. Rie, are you still in love with Doi? Oh, please! It was a long time ago. But he's your kid's father. Hey, we had some bad luck the other day. You've been watching me ride? Not bad, eh? Actually, you're cool. I'm nuts about riding. I wanna race, once I get my own bike. How can you be so proud on someone else's bike? Shut up. Let me sit behind. I'll rape you! Just kidding - get on. Let's ride on the road. You idiot - we can't ride on the road. Why's that? That's the law. So what? Rules are made to be broken. You don't even dare to do that? Of course I do. Hold tight. This is the best. Damn it. Yoshichu Corporation I got you out of trouble again. Next time, don't ask me! Even as a member of the city council... ...it's embarassing to ask the police for favors too often. Dad, can I have a million yen? I wanna buy a fancy bike and form a team. If I have a million yen, I may become the champion of Japan. With everything you need in life, why are you always fooling around? You're neither going to classes, nor staying at home. I've provided everything you need throughout your life! That's why nothing seems interesting to me. What? Am I wrong? Whether I study or don't... I'll still become the owner of Yoshioka Pharmaceutical and inherit your fortune. Nothing is more boring than this. Idiot! Don't think you can be a smart ass just because you're my only son. Sorry to make you come here. What's this about? Kazu, Mom has something important to say. Go play over there. Okay. Well, I'm listening. Actually I just wanted to apologize. Forget it. It's over. I don't think it'd be over just by apologizing to you. But I want you to know the truth. It's not necessary. It's easy to say "five years", but that's a long time for a woman. Mister, will you go on the merry-go-round with me, please? I've never been on it before. So, please. No, don't be naughty. No fun! I don't like mommy! Okay, let's go. Popular Young Singer Yuki Shinohara It's Yuki's show. Haven't seen her for a long time. You know Yuki Shinohara? Yeah, we were at the same talent agency together. She's now a popular singer, but I'm in the Athens Gang. What a cruel world... Hiromi, why did you quit singing anyway? Well, I couldn't make a living by singing. Nothing works without money. But I'm glad that Yuki's made it. We've arrived. Sorry, but no autographs for now. Hello, Yuki! Yuki, I'm glad that you got popular. I've always listened to your songs. I'm so happy! Hey, do something about this girl. Oh, I thought you knew her. Why would I know someone like her? Yuki, don't you remember that we were always together before? My friends are here too... People are looking at me. Don't ruin my good image. Cut that out. Don't talk to her like she's your friend. How could you be so rude! You're the rude one! I came to see Yuki! You can't go in. Go away! Ouch... Manager... I'm telling you not to go in. Don't you ever come again! Yes, I'm coming. It hurts. Let me go! Disgraceful! How can a member of the Athens Gang act like that to some pop idol? It makes me mad. Want me to tell you something interesting? A scandal concerning Yuki Shinohara. Tell me, Jiro. I can't give it to you for free. That's our rule. So, how much? Very expensive. No one else has heard it yet. Jiro, how about if I sleep with you? Please, I'll do it. Tell us about the scandal. It's for our Athens Gang. Okay, I'll introduce you to a good guy. He's a professional 'scandal hound'. Blue Castle Hotel Papa... When does congress start? Don't pull me back to reality. Sorry. Yuki... I bought a condo in Kyoto. You can move in. Really, Papa? I love you. Wow, you taste so good. Send me to heaven! Hey, use either of these. Thanks. Two million yen for the photos with negatives. A million and a half for the cassettes. So, three and a half million yen in total. You can hush up the scandal of the congressman and the pop singer. I think it's a good deal. You... But we don't have that much money... Then we should sell it to magazines too. No, you can't. Then pay up! Though you don't have any real sense for politics... ...you're very good at 'night politics', huh? Well, we can talk about this. So don't... do anything silly. Hey, it's our whore pop singer. Long time no see. We've caught your sweet moments with this congressman. Yuki, you're pretty. When it's for you, I can do anything. Stop it! You, stop! Stop, all of you! That's your love-making voice! Pay attention, stop struggling. Yuki, you forgot about me? I'm Jiro who used to work with you, remember? When someone stole money from the factory... ...they suspected me, since I had saved money and finally bought a guitar. I got fired because of that. I even wrote you a letter later because I liked you. Then what did you say to me? "Don't ever write to me again, you thief!" I'll never forget what you said! Mister Congressman, you don't have to give me money. I'll make sure everyone in Japan sees those pictures! You idiots, what have you done! Stop it, bastard! Jiro, what have you done? Mr. Kondo, let me explain, Mr. Kondo... Mr. Congressman is a good friend of our boss. I'll never forgive you for doing something like this! Okay, that's enough. No violence please. We're very sorry. What, you think you're great because you're a ganster? You animal! Insect! Tonight is the end of your solo show. You'll be on TV in Tokyo starting from tomorrow. Daddy has promised he'll buy 20,000 copies of my new CD. Oh, Mr. Shimizu's waiting for us. Let's go. I'll be waiting here for you, but please hurry if you could. It's okay. I'll stay here tonight. Why are you gonna stay? Someone help! Help me! No, no! Stop! Someone help! Hey, this troublesome woman is yours now. Do whatever you like to her. No, help! Stop! Stop! No, stop it! Stop! Help! Serves you right! Cheers! This is what's called a journalist's big success story, isn't it? Thanks to this scoop, I can finally pay off what I owe to this club. So go ahead and drink! Good for you. You've done a good job for me! Congrats! Thank you. Let's drink. Cheers! Sake is to drink; women are to hold. Yeah, women are to hold - right, my dear? Hey, wait, who's this? A handsome guy, but I don't know him. Wait, I've seen him in a movie. Who are you? My name is Goro Sujida. I'm a "journalist". Well, don't call yourself a journalist so easily. So what do you do? Well, I've been invited to join major newspaper companies... I'm the uncrowned king of muck-rakers who never forgot the spirit of journalism. You look like you were delivered by cesarean section, so what about you? It's called 'Surino'. Oh, its headquarters are in Toyama, right? Yeah, the name of our newspaper is the Anne Daily Report. Oh, the red flag. I see. Well, you're getting old, so take care of yourself. Okay? Congrats, congrats...! Cheers! Who was he anyway? Mr. Ichiroku, why hasn't the congressman's name been revealed? This isn't right. Jiro, good question. You're right about that. Representing all journalists in Japan, I'm ashamed. More beer. Japan's journalism hasn't been fully developed yet. There are a lot of things going on. We should follow the example of the New York Times and the Washington Post... ...who bravely reported the crimes that the US Army committed in the Vietnam War. Well, I'll eventually reform and improve our journalism. Make sure you report the "elevator raping". You idiot? Wanna know what'll happen if I did that? Your Athens Gang and Hokushin Association will be in shackles like this. Jun, what have you done? We blackmailed the congressman with Jiro. We were interrupted by the Akimoto Group, but we raped Yuki Shinohara. Why didn't you discuss this with me beforehand? We've earned 300,000 yen from the blackmailing! Reiko, are you telling me this isn't enough? It's not about money! Well, who said money and fighting were most important, huh? I'm saying the Athens rules weren't followed. Don't make me laugh! Why do people like us need that shit? Jun, don't talk like you know what you're doing. What're you gonna do if we upset the Akimoto Group or get busted by the pigs? I'm the boss, understand? Hiromi, you can have this. Thank you. But this has been precious to you since you were in Okinawa, right? It's okay. I wanna forget what happened in Okinawa. Okinawa's gonna be returned to Japan soon, right? I won't go back there. Why not? Your mom's still there, right? I like to be alone. But the view of the clear sea of Okinawa... ...is somehow never far from my sight. Hiromi, sing something. No, I'm shy. Silly. You said you tried to become a singer before. But I don't wanna sing no more. I gave that up too. Give me one. Pass me one too. See how smart I am? How about having some watermelon? Watermelon, here... Hey guys, who gave you permission to sell here? What about it? Why so uptight? The beach is for everyone. What? This is our turf. Remember? Wait. They're the Athens Gang, not strangers. Just let it pass. But Boss, it'll happen again if we let them this time. I'm saying it's okay. That's my man! Hey, Sase, what are you doing? Help me if you've got time. Stealing? Okay, you asked the right guy. Hey, what're you doing? Your little "window" is open. Uh oh! Hey, if you help me steal this car, I'll let you enjoy these tonight. Oh... so soft... I feel them! Sase... Prostitution on a boat! How exciting! I'm on fire! Hurry up or I'll charge more for extra time. Hey, look away. I can't finish if you keep looking. That's good. I'm coming... I can service you too if you want. How about for five hundred yen? Shut up! This is all I need. She won't shut up and I can't finish quickly. If I can't finish, I can't leave. Your voice makes me sweat too. Eiji, stop it! How can you tell me what to do while using my boat without permission? I won't charge you for the boat but you have to let me "ride" you. Stop being ridiculous. Just let me! We'll all have sex together. Shut up, you idiot! Stop it! Bastard, what do you want? I know you've fallen for me. So just let me. You kidding me? Swim like this... We'll come here again next Sunday, okay? Sounds good. Okay, get into the car. I'll take you to eat a bowl of rice topped with egg. Oh my, there's no tire! The tire is gone! One tire is... Oh no, the other side is gone too. Two in total disappeared! What should we do, my dear? Mister, someone stole your tires, huh? There's been a tire theif in this neighborhood. It's happened a lot. Oh dear... A police officer told me to be careful not long ago. Oh, yeah. Actually I can offer you a good deal on tires. Oh, thank you for doing this. Thank you. Mister, I'll let you have these for 8,000 yen, okay? How reasonable. "Help others as much as you can" was the teaching of Prince Shotoku. Here's 8,000 yen. Thanks. Thank you again. Oh, no problem. Hey, you should thank him too. Thank you for your help. What a good young man. Listen, you guys have to become a good person just like him, okay? Sase, don't interrupt me. I've gotta steal ten tires and enjoy a romantic night with Sase... I'm arresting you for stealing! Oh, officer! Help! What're you doing? Don't struggle. Sase! Nukesaku got busted because of you guys. He'd talk you to death, but we gotta do something about this. I understand. Jiro, we'll accept any punishment. We've been protecting the Athens Gang. Things like this happen. You saved your ass because Nukesaku was busted. Reiko, I'll let you off for now, but you owe me. What? You like my boss, don't you? You're patient, even though we got your guy into trouble. I can see that. You idiot! Why would I...? You've fallen for her! No, I didn't! Yes, you did! You wanna get hit? Show me the proof that you haven't fallen for her. Yuko... I... I "broke" my virginity myself... but you made me a real woman for the first time. I gave you my virginity. I like you. I like you! But I can't because of the rules of the Athens Gang... What the hell is that? Forget those stupid rules! Yuko, come with me. You know what I'm gonna say, right? Yuko, repeat the rules of Athens Gang. Sleeping with Jiro for no reason means you're being controlled by a specific man. Boss, you're frustrated, aren't you? What did you say? I did what you actually wanted to do. That's why you're jealous. Why don't all the members do this together? You hate me. You hate me for sleeping with Jiro! Maybe you're right. Yuko... To love someone is to trust someone. But I can't trust this adult society. Actually... I'm the same. My mother married a guy after she got divorced. At night, my step-father would come to my room and touch me. I couldn't tell anyone. In school, I couldn't concentrate on anything because of it. Yuko, no one will help us in this whole world. We can only count on ourselves. Okay, you may go. No, I don't wanna go anywhere. I'll do anything for you, Boss. I'll even die if you want me to. Yuko... Don't leave me alone! I'll give up Jiro... so don't give up on me. Sister... Thank you for seeing me, sir. You didn't do anything to disgrace the name of our gang, did you? No. This way. That man is an important person for our group. A loan shark. Our group needs to borrow 30 million yen from him. Jiro, I want you to do me a favor. No problem, I'll do anything for you. That loan shark is a pervert. If a good-looking girl were to make him "happy", it would be easier to negotiate with him. Get Reiko of the Athens Gang to please him tonight. Reiko? If you make that happen, you'll become a member immediately. I've gotta sleep with a pervert? Please. This is a perfect chance for me to climb the ladder. You're kidding me. I've never slept with anyone because someone told me to! Even if I beg you, you still won't do it? I might be a desperate Sukeban, but I'm not a whore. Well, remember that you owe me. You pay what you owe. That's our agreement, right? Fine. I'll do it then. Tonight at 7 o'clock, Hotel Suna, Room 28. I'll meet you in the lobby. The time for car sex is over. Now is the time for a "bike fuck". What do you mean by "bike fuck"? You'll know when your "secret place" is pleased. Alright, let's go. Let's start. Whoever gets the fartherest wins, got it? When you come, you stop, understand? Got it. Reiko, we won. Reiko, everyone is waiting for us. Let's go back. No, don't. Why not? I don't wanna go back. You have to be somewhere at 7 o'clock, don't you? Yeah, but it's okay. But... you're the boss. I wanna be just "Reiko" today. Eiji, hold me. Thanks to you, I have lost face with the Akimoto Group! Reiko. It's time to fully atone for what the Athens Gang owes to the Hokushin. Are you listening, Reiko? Wait, I'm responsible for what Reiko did. Aren't you guys too old-fashioned? Idiot! Ouch! What's wrong with two lovers sleeping together? Eiji, this has nothing to do with you. So, go away. It's ridiculous that, as our leader, you broke both the rules and a promise! Don't you think so, everybody? Time for punishment. Mayumi, speed up more. She'll die if we do that. Just do it! Jun. Jun, stop it. Jun! Let's choose a new boss now. Who should we choose? Who wants to be boss? If no one else does, I'll be the boss. Everyone else, is it okay to let Jun be the new boss? I want Jun to be boss. Me too. Then that'll be our decision. Wait... I took my punishment; I'm still a member. I also have the right to be the new boss. As long as you're in love with Eiji, you're not following the rules. No, I don't love him and I won't ever. I only belong to the Athens Gang. What should we do, guys? Well, why don't Reiko and I fight for it? Fine, come on! Boss, how can you in your condition... She's no boss! We'll decide who's the boss now. Damn it. Shit! Bitch! Stand up. Reiko won. Let's forget about all this and start over again. Jun. It's too bad, but I lost. I'll leave the Athens Gang. Jun. Everyone, thank you for everything. Reiko... I lost to you... but I have no hard feelings at all. Reiko, I lost to your guts. Jun, you're gonna quit no matter what? Some people feel lonelier whilst in a group. Hiromi, would you sing a farewell song... I wanna leave while you're singing. Okay. Before you say good-bye... please hold me once more So lonely, missing you... I'd rather just die Tips of your fingers and your lips... I will never forget I hate the sea, my lover... Can't help missing you Feeling sad for my painful heart Being loved, being left behind I want to forget everything now If someday you come quietly back to the seaport town... then I won't ever let you go again That day, I should have followed behind him Crying alone at the pier... Jiro, our boss has looked out for you on many occasions. The trouble with the congressman was resolved because Boss helped out. Besides, he even let you take care of the beach territory. How could you do something that would bring dishonor upon our group? I'm very sorry... Shut up! The Hokushin Assosication is dissolved as of today... but Boss will take your members in. You're kidding, right? Those guys have nowhere to go... I'll feel sorry if someone dosen't take care of them. That's too much, Boss. What did you say to me before? "Make a good team, and someday they'll become my right hand". So your words mean nothing now? Quiet! Boss! Bastard! I'm leaving. I've seen enough "money play" when I was a kid. Let me take care of the Athens Gang. I won't treat you badly. I refuse. You brat. Our Athens Gang accepts orders from no one. Stop bragging. You were my members from the beginning, bound by invisible chains. I'm just pulling you closer to me. No, we weren't. Yes, you were. We're stray dogs. We've never begged food from you! Is that so? Jiro, you listen too. Even if you think you weren't given food, the chain is still there. That's just the way it is. I'm going home. Jiro, let's go. - Wait. - What the hell? You stupid bitch! What's with that look? Isn't that enough already? Brother, let me take care of this. If a kid like him gets half killed, people will laugh at us. So don't. Jiro. Mr. Doi. Brother, you still don't seem to understand who's the boss. Hey, this won't end if we let him go now. Do it! Kono, when did you start talking to me like that? Maybe I should shut you up once and for all. Boss, I didn't get locked up in prison for someone this filthy. Bastard, are you rebelling against me? You weren't like this before. Shut up. If you wanna do this regardless of what I say... ...then you're gonna have to let me quit too. Let them go. Damn it. Reiko, what should I do now? Tell me. I wanted to crawl out of the garbage and make something of myself. Coward. You wanna be one of them that badly? Isn't it okay just to be a stray dog? Let's go to my place. There are a lot of bitches who choose to become stray dogs. Be strong. What happened, Reiko? How embarrassing! What the hell? Jiro. Eiji, give us a ride. Okay, get on. I won't. Don't worry. You don't have to think you owe me anything. Hold tight. I wanted to tell you the other day... but I couldn't. In addition to betraying you, how can I make you suffer more? Kazuyo is your daughter. I thought so... or perhaps I wished so, somewhere deep in my heart. Forgive me, please. Hmm, this is good quality stuff. What is this drug? It's a method of concentrating chemicals called hydrochloric acid and triphenyl. It's from the crew of a foreign cruiser. The street price would be 200 million yen for one kilogram. 200 million? Mr. Tamori, let me have that connection. I need 30 million yen cash right now. I didn't know what to do, since the loan shark I counted on didn't work out. Well, actually the connection isn't developed yet. We haven't sourced a supply of the chemical material yet. So where can we get it? Probably big pharmaceutical companies. They're like role-models for guys like Jiro, huh? There's no way the Athens Gang or Jiro can overcome them. Let's make fun of the Akimoto Group. Come! Get away from us if you don't wanna get hit! Idiots! Let's go. Who are they? I've never even seen them before. They're called the Guren-tai. The leader is the grandson of the owner of Yoshioka Pharmaceutical. Yoshioka Pharmaceutical? You brat, how dare you make fun of our boss! What are you talking about? I didn't do it. Stop it! Die, you bastard! Brother...! Stop! Brother! Damn it. Take him. Eiji! Hello. Akimoto Industrial? What... Eiji? It might just be personality, but there are guys who act recklessly without thinking. Mr. Yoshioka, it depends on how you think about it. So do we have a deal? I'd do anything for my son's sake. I want you to get 500 grams of hydrochloric acid and triphenyl. Hydrochloric acid and triphenyl? But that's... ...for making drugs and that's why we're asking you. It's not expensive if you're exchanging it for your son's life. Help me. Stop it. What the hell are you doing! Mr. Yoshioka, why don't you understand? With your word, your son will be set free. Mr. Yoshioka, you'd better settle this matter with those chemicals. But if someone finds out, it'll be the end of Yoshioka Pharmaceutical! Can't you do something about it? Help me, Dad. Help... Bastard... I'll kill you. Help! Eiji...! Wait... I... I'll get you what you want. When? I'll give it to you by 1PM tomorrow. Good. We'll keep your son until then. If you dare call the police, you die. You wanna quit? Yes, please let me. Doi, are you sure about that? Yes. If Masa the Assassin chooses a family life, the members would be disappointed. Masa the Assassin... that name has become more of a burden to me these days. Before you quit, I want you to do one more thing for me. What is it? I can only count on you to do this job. Five million yen as compensation. Listen Doi, it'll be the time for our organization to prosper. I'll definitely take over Hanshin United Association. Power comes from money. Money is necessary for everything we do. You'll help me, won't you? Okay. But this will be Masa the Assassin's last assignment. How did it go? I persuaded Doi to do it... but he wants to quit. Quit? Can we trust someone who wants to quit? It's okay... dead men don't talk. Everyone who knows the secret will die. Akimoto's trying to get 30 million from Yoshioka Pharmaceutical by kidnapping his son. Really? They'll trade Eiji for hydrochloric acid and triphenyl. What is that? Got a light? 200 million yen for one kilogram. 100 million for 500 grams, 50 million for 250 grams, 25 million for 125 grams. It becomes a drug after being concentrated. A drug? I, Muck-raker Ichiroku, busted my ass to sneak into Yoshioka's to get this scoop. This is a once-in-a-lifetime scoop. So do you wanna buy it for 500 thousand yen? Yes, we do. It's 500 thousand, okay? We don't have that much now, but we will later. I'm sure Akimoto's gonna destroy the Athens gang in a week. How exciting to do something big like this! You have every girl's body as collateral, so tell us all about it. Yes, please. Tell us, Mr. Ichiroku! Your bodies as collateral, what a cute thing to say! Well, I see. I, Muck-raker Ichiroku, have gotten myself into the fire of justice! I'm the uncrowned king of journalism. Well, you guys've got a sense of solidarity too, huh? I think I'll develop a good sense of unity with you. Come closer. The deal between Akimoto and Yoshioka will take place on a ship called the Shinyoto... at 1PM tomorrow. We've got to take this chance to destroy Akimoto. To survive, stray dogs have got to bite before being killed. Eiji. Make this the first time and the last one. This is it. Eiji... Hurry. Hey, look. Alright, now. Dad, stop the car! Where are you going, Reiko? We're gonna fight the Akimoto Group. We're gonna take that 30 million yen. Eiji! Good, I'm going too. Eiji, no you're not! I can't trust you to drive a bike. Let me drive. Eiji, come back! Good job. Doi, I've told you that being a family man isn't for you. Damn you! I'd rather have a family than your dirty 'chivalrous' spirit. Bastard... Give me it! Bastard, wait! Mr. Doi! Mr. Doi, the gun. Damn you. Eiji! Eiji! Stop! Dad! Bastard! You stupid bitch... Damn it. Eiji, get out of here! Damn it. Hurry up! Wait! Mr. Doi... I've finally done something like a man. Stupid bastard... You and I... always were... How much fun! This is what I've been looking for. This kind of thrill! Damn... Eiji, I'm counting on you. Yeah. Eiji! Go to hell, asshole! Serves you right, bastard! Stole and assaulted in Akasaka yesterday... Started up a fight in Shinjuku today Things go bad and out of control in Roppongi... The chilliness of the evening wind breaks the day The Girl Boss Blues
