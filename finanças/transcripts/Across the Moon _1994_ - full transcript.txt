Beautiful gold and steel cars and trucks. They aren't just beautiful. - Come on, Richie. Come on, man. - [Carmen] Paco, you gonna turn that damn thing down? - She's on the warpath, man. - [Paco] Hey, let me see. - It's not for kids. - [Paco] Come on, just let me hold it. - What's the matter with you? I know you're stupid, but this is too stupid. - Come on, Carmencita, give me the piece, baby, I gotta go. - You know, I got a sore throat from arguing with you. - Yeah, well, this time you're wrong, all right? This time it's the long money. It's easy, simple, safe. (bullets thump) - That's why you need the gun? Because it's easy, simple, safe? - Look, the gun is just for show, all right? Nobody is shooting nobody. It's a piece of cake, Lyle checked it out. - Oh, Lyle checked it out. - [Richie] Yeah. - Why don't that make me feel better? You're a lousy thief, Richie. Look for another line of work, please. (gun clicking) - Carmen, hey, will you just listen to me? They're dentists, okay, two fucking dentists. They got nothing but money and they want to deal some weight. They're not tough guys, they're dentists. They're gonna piss, they'll be in such a hurry to give us the money when Lyle and me pull our guns. - What if they pull their guns? - They don't got guns, they're dentists. - Today everybody got guns. - Ay, Dios. Hey, we're talking about a lot of money. Don't put a curse on me, carina. - I just get scared for you, Richie. - I know. - How long you gonna be gone? - As long as it takes. (Carmen and Richie laughing) I love you. - I love you right back. (lighter clicking) - You're late, Lyle, you're fucking late, man! - Come on, let's go, let's go. - [Richie] Where's your bike? - [Lyle] They stole it last night. - Fucking thieves. - Hey, it's all right, listen, Richie, it's fine. We pull this off we buy 10 bikes. It's not worth the headache, all right, it's not worth it. I fucking loved that bike, man. - I know you did, man. Watch the feet, watch your feet! Let me see the goods. - Huh? - Yeah, it looks righteous to me. These turkeys aren't gonna know that it's talcum powder until they snort it. - That's right. - By that time they'll have the gun six inches up their ass. - That's right, you got it. You ready, you good? - I'm good. - Hey, fuck 'em up, all right? We can do it, let's do it, let's go. (engine rumbling) (upbeat music) - You guys are late, we thought you weren't coming. - You got the fucking money? - You got the fucking dope? - Huh? - All right. (suspenseful music) The money. Let me see what's in there. - Wait, let me taste the dope. - Show me first, come on, let's go. - Let's just do it, let's go. - Let's do it. - Police, freeze! - What, what? - Don't move, don't move! - Hands behind your head, get out of the car. - Move, move, move, move! - All right, come on, out of the car. (police siren wailing) (tires screeching) - They're cops, man, the fucking dentists are cops! - It's all right. - Lyle, we're fucked! - Look, you guys got nothing, we didn't do nothing. Those aren't drugs, it's talcum powder. - You pointed a gun at me. I am a police officer. Now, don't you think that that might be slightly illegal? - I really thought you guys were dentists. You're fucking good. - You guys are not so good. In fact, you should be ashamed to call yourself criminals. - My girlfriend's gonna kill me. - Excuse me, are you Carmen? - Yeah, so? - I'm Kathy. - You're from the public defender's office? - No, I'm Lyle's girlfriend. - You are Lyle's old lady? (laughing) - Is there something funny about that? - Um, you, uh, just don't look like I thought. No, you look, you know, kind of uptown, that's all. Hey, come on, don't get mad. How much time you think the boys will get? - Well, my lawyer says that Lyle will get one to three years. What's your lawyer say about Richie? - I ain't got a lawyer, I got a public defender. She's maybe 21 years old. I ask her how long, she tells me she don't like to speculate, asshole. So, you know, I figured same crime, same time, no? Depending on how bad Lyle's record is. Richie's got a couple of priors. - Yeah, Lyle has one prior and some stuff when he was a juvenile, but they can't use that against him. - That's what he told you, just one prior? Sit. Where are you from, San Francisco? - No, LA. Anyway, that's where I grew up. Lyle and I just moved up here about a year go. Get away from all that LA craziness. - Yeah. - Where are you from? - Same as you, LA, East LA, you? - West LA. All right, Beverly Hills. - Hey, we all gotta be from somewhere. You know, but if you've got money, why do you let Lyle steal? He's about as good at it as my Richie, which is lousy. - Look, don't let Beverly Hills fool you, okay? I don't have any money. I got the 10,000 to pay the lawyer by telling my parents I was gonna use it to get away from Lyle. My father cried when I told him how I spent it. I don't think they're gonna be giving me any more. - They're not crazy about Lyle, huh? - No, they don't like his tattoos. - Well, Carmen, I think it's fair to say we did good. Very good. I made the best deal I could, three to five. If he behaves himself, he's out in 30 months. - You know, what I figured... - How long for Lyle? - Why don't we talk about this over lunch? - How long, Roy? - What can I tell you? Lyle's looking at 36 months minimum. Now, how about lunch? I'm buying, I can explain the entire situation to you. - You feel like a free lunch? He's buying. - Right, right, you're both invited, my pleasure. Double pleasure, definitely. - Do you know how hard it is to find $10,000? And for what? Lyle got more time than Richie and Richie only had a PD. What the hell did you do for $10,000? - Hey, I understand, you're upset. Your boyfriend was facing a maximum seven to 10 years. But I called in a lot of favors. 36 months is a bargain. You see, Kathy, you don't understand how these things work. If you understood, you'd be thanking me. - Where are they serving their time? - Only place they had any room was at Tehachalpi Correction Facility. - Tehacha what? Where the hell is that? - 400, 500 miles south, down in the desert. Dry climate, not such a bad place. Visiting every weekend and holidays. - Are you crazy? That's 10 hours by car each way. - If you got a good car. Kathy, you got a good car? - I don't have any car. - So happens I have a place, very nice place in Mojave. It was given to me by a former client. Now, I never use it, I never go there. It's maybe 60 miles from Tehachalpi Prison, okay, all right? Is that making it up to you? - How much is it? I don't have any money left and I have no place to get more. - You think I'm only interested in your money? - Oh, is there something else that you're interested in? - Let me be honest, Kathy, perfectly honest, okay? I'm attracted to you. I'd love to go out with you, see you. You know, see you. - You should fuck him, Kathy. I mean, he's giving you a free place near your old man. That's what you want, right, to be near your old man? It's only right that you fuck him. - You wanna fuck him, Carmen, you fuck him. - He ain't my lawyer. He ain't giving me a free place nowhere. - Listen, Carmen, you're perfectly welcome to stay there, too, plenty of space. - I'm sure there's a law against it. - There's absolutely no law against it. - You ever had an AIDS test? - Yeah, a couple of times, but not lately. - I had a herpes test once, and sure enough, I had it. So I'm not going for that AIDS test. - Listen, I don't want you girls to do anything you don't feel right about. - Well, we'll still get the place in the desert, right? I mean, it doesn't depend on us screwing you. - I said the place was yours, if you want it. - I want it, you? - What have I got here that's so great? A kid two inches from being a gang banger, a lousy rented joint in an ugly little town. With Richie gone, I might as well go someplace, too. (upbeat music) - [Kathy] Pretty country. Sure is a lot of it. - [Carmen] Kathy, you sure we weren't supposed to turn off somewhere? - [Kathy] Have we come to Jumping Cactus Road yet? - [Carmen] I didn't see no signs. Do you think maybe they don't got a sign? Should I turn here? - [Kathy] Might as well. - [Paco] Cows! - [Kathy] Oh, gross. What are we gonna do? - Wait for the cowboy. (cowboy hooting) Hey mister! - Ladies. - Um, we're looking for, what's the name? - Um, Jumping Cactus Road. We can't find it. - Well, you did find it, this is Jumping Cactus Road. Whereabouts you wanna go? - Um, three miles from the mailboxes, and then we're supposed to turn right for four miles, and it's a house with a green roof. - (laughing) You mean a trailer with a roof that used to be green. The dopers' trailer. - What? A trailer? - Um, we don't know nothing about no dopers. - Roy said a house. - We just borrowed the place. You live around here? - Oh, that bastard. - Just over the ridge. - Oh, that's nice. I thought we were the only human beings around here. - (laughing) Nah, there's lots of folks around here. You just don't always see 'em right away. (cows mooing) - Yep, that was a cowboy. An old cowboy, but a cowboy. (tense music) No way! (Kathy groaning) - We're lost, right? - Not a chance, this is the right place. - I was hoping it wasn't. - What is this? - Home. I know it don't look like much, but that's because it ain't much. - Oh, that fucker, Roy. Excuse me, Paco. Dammit, I shoulda known. - Hey, what's the matter with you people? Mm, we got fresh air, and no noisy neighbors. - No neighbors at all. - Who needs them? We got free rent. - Free rent is too expensive for this dump. - We do a little cleaning up, it's gonna be fine. - If we bomb it, it's still not gonna be fine. (mouse squeaking) (Carmen and Kathy screaming) - Ay, Dios mio, I got fucking Princess Di for a roommate. - It stinks in here. - And now, we hear from the little prince. - Carmen, I cannot live like this. - Me neither, come on, let's just go back to San Jose. - Get the broom and the mop and the bucket and the soap out of the car. Now. Oh my god. (Kathy coughing) (bird screeching) (metal clanking) (Kathy sighing) - Pretty sure I'm gonna hate it here. - [Carmen] I need some help with this couch, you guys. - Tell your mother that slavery is against the law here in America. - [Carmen] What, am I talking to myself? Paco, Kathy, get in here. - You tell her. - [Kathy] I think I hate the wide open spaces. - What's the matter, you miss the malls? - Right. If putting me down makes you feel better, Carmen, then go right ahead, but I can't deal with it. - Let me tell you the truth. Nothing about you makes me feel better. I don't think this is gonna work out. You have been bitching since we left San Jose. - Oh, tough girl. Tough girl from the Bajio. - Yeah, better than a middle class fucking little bitch from Beverly Hills. - Don't you call me middle class, and don't you ever call me a fucking bitch. I don't let men talk to me that way, and I'm certainly not gonna let you. Fuck you. - Fuck you! (somber music) (fly buzzing) (insects chirping) It's kinda peaceful. - Yeah. Well, I'm a city girl. I like a couple of lampposts around. Maybe even a little neon. Oh god, what we do for our men. - [Paco] One good thing, they got no schools out here. - Hey, they got schools in town, tomorrow I take you, get you all set up. - [Paco] Shit. - Watch your mouth, go to sleep. (radio blaring) (blues music) (Carmen singing in foreign language) (engine rumbling) - I've never been inside a prison before. Have you? - Yeah. To visit my father. I was younger than Paco. - Yeah, you know, I learned about that in psyche. It's called the prison cycle syndrome. See, the father figure goes to prison, and then the son, who naturally wants to emulate the father, or father figure, is subconsciously taught that prison is a natural way of a man's life. So he eventually goes to prison too. - Shut up. - Don't get mad at me. It's a psychological fact of life. I mean, your dad was in jail, right? Now Richie's in jail, so according to statistics, Paco will- - You netter shut your face. - Hey, I'm sorry. Really. You're probably right, what do I know? Stuff they teach you in school, what's it got to do with real life, right? (Kathy sighing) Paco isn't Richie's kid, is he? - He's my kid. His father was a junkie shit, mistake of my youth. But Richie treats Paco good, you know? Like he was his own son, sort of. - I am his son, he told me so. He said I am the son of his heart. (Carmen laughing) What the fuck does that mean? - I tell Richie how you talk, he'd kick your ass. - No he wouldn't. - Oh yeah? You wanna find out? I'll tell him. - You don't have to tell him. (engine rumbling) - [Guard] Visitors' parking to the right, follow the sign. - [Prison Officer] No whites allowed, and no bare midriff. - What do you think, the boys are gonna see a bellybutton and start a riot? - Look, all I was told was that I couldn't wear blue jeans. Nobody said anything to me about white. - Sorry, you'll have to change. - Change into what? What do you think I do, carry a couple of sets of clothes around with me? - Move on, next. - You're gonna have to go back to the trailer. - Carmen, that's an hour and a half each way. By the time I get back, visiting hours will be over. - Honey, I got an outfit in my car, just got back from the cleaners. You can borrow it if you want. - Oh, thank you, you don't know how much I appreciate this. - Okay, come on. - Hurry up. - Just meet me here, okay? - Thanks. (Kathy sighing) (Carmen laughing) - Sorry. - You think it's funny? I wanted to look nice. - Tell Lyle you've been dieting. - [Prison Guard] Coming in. All right fellas, move on through. (door clanking) - I miss you so much. You don't know how much I missed you. - You know how much I miss you, hmm? - Hmm, you do miss me. - I've been dreaming about you every night. You dreaming about me? - Course I do. - Mm hmm? - I dream about you even when I'm not asleep. - Where? - I'm not telling. - No, no, tell me, where? - Well. - No, no, no, leave it, leave your hand. - People can see us. - It don't matter, just so long as the guard don't see us. - How are things at home with Kathy? - She's pure white bread. I mean, she don't mean nothing bad, but, you know, she doesn't know shit about shit. You know, she's scared of living in the desert? She's scared of everything. - You got a job? You making a living? - I'm still looking. Not a lot of jobs in these little towns. - [Paco] We gonna eat now? - Paco. (people chatting) - I would kill for a beer. No, I would kill for one hour with you alone, I would kill. - Is there some place we could go? (gentle music) - What you think about the joint? Bad, huh? - I don't know how they can stand it in there. - They ain't got a choice. - I just feel so sorry for them, you know? I never knew what it was like. - Hey, Paco, sweetheart, don't you got some homework to do? - It's boring, - What's boring? - School. Homework. This place. There's nothing to do. - How do you know it's boring? You never go no place. Why don't you take a little walk like an explorer? - What am I supposed to explore? - Well, go find out, huh? Take a little hike, why don't you? Don't go too far and come back before it's dark, huh? Look, why don't you go see what's over that hill? (bird screeching) If that welfare check don't come by tomorrow, we're in trouble. Big trouble. - Well, I think I've got a job in a supermarket in Mojave. They're gonna let me know for sure next week. - We ain't gonna last till next week without that damn check. (insects chirping) (bird screeching) (Sampson roaring) - Oh god, please don't let him eat me, please don't let him eat me. - Hey kid. What do you think you're doing? - That's a lion. - [Frank] You know this is private property? - Does he bite? - Old Sampson? No. He don't hardly have any teeth left. But you get him mad and he'll sit on you, now what are you doing around here? - Nothing. I just came over the hill. Where'd you get a lion? - I got a tiger too. (Louie Louie growling) - He's beautiful. What's his name? - Louie Louie. - So what do you do with him? - I train him, for movies and TV commercials, things like that. You ever see that commercial where the guy says, "This is my dog, Spot," only it's a lion, did you ever see that one? - Yeah, sure. - That's Sampson. And Louie Louie here, he was in Sheena: Queen of the Jungle, that was years ago, you ever see that movie? - Does he got any teeth? - You bet. Not like old Sampson there. I gotta cut his meat for him. Louie Louie's got beautiful teeth though. And a hell of an appetite. Eats 40, 50 pounds of meat at a time. - [Paco] Where'd you get him? - [Frank] I bought him off a guy in Hollywood. - He in the movies now? - Well, to tell you the truth, the industry's a little bit slow right now, but we got a couple of deals that might come through. (birds screeching) - [Carmen] Damn! (Carmen sighing) - [Kathy] You got the check? - No. I got a letter that says since I moved from San Jose, they can't send me the welfare till I tell 'em where I'm living. - If they had the address to send you the letter... - It don't matter, shit! I gotta do it all over again, and then I gotta wait another three weeks. - Now, we need it now! - You don't got any stash, a rat hole somewhere do you, hey? - God, don't I wish. Carmen, I wouldn't hold out on you. - Oh. We don't got a can of nothing? - There's no food, Carmen, no money. Stop pretending there's a little more, we're out of everything. - [Carmen] Nothing, zero? - Nada. - zip? - [Kathy] You got it, we're wiped out, finished. - Wrong. We got a few gallons of gas in the car. We're not finished, I do not surrender. I ain't gonna fucking lay down and die. I got a kid to feed. Okay. I got the answer. We knock over a 7-Eleven, there's one in Mojave, what do you say? - I say you're going crazy. Or do you think you're gonna be able to share a cell with Richie? No 7-Elevens. - Oh god. Oh, you're right, I am going crazy, we don't even have a gun. - All right, what have we got to sell? - Pussy. - What? - What, what? English your second language? - I couldn't do that, I'm not a whore. - Well, I'm not a whore either, but I'm gonna do it because I can't think of anything else. I don't got parents in Beverly Hills, I don't got parents period. - Don't run me through that crap again, please. You know my parents aren't gonna give me any money. - Look, I'm gonna do what I have to do. You can't do it, you don't do it. - Well, it's not like I think I'm too good to be a hooker or something. - You don't gotta explain nothing. - It's just that I've never done anything like that before. - I understand. - How much will we charge? - How much you think we're worth, a couple of beauties like us? - $100, 200. - In Vegas, maybe, this is poor man's country. We charge 30 bucks, settle for 25. - $25? I am worth much more than $25, and so are you. - Let me tell you something my grandfather used to say. You know what the most valuable thing in the world is? A head of a dead cat. Why? 'Cause you can't put a price on it. We charge what we can get. (bead curtain rattling) - Where are you going? - We're going to town, we'll be back late. - Can I come too? - No. I'm gonna go look for a job, okay? You stay here and do your schoolwork, okay sweetheart? (engine rumbling) (tires screeching) (blues music) Where we going? - A bar, I guess. - Bar's risky. You know, these little towns, everybody knows everybody, a working girl wouldn't last long enough to finish her drink. I guess we got no choice. - Well, let's use our heads. - Well, they probably will. We're looking for men, right? - Yeah. I am really lucky to have a college girl for a partner. Of course we're looking for men, Jesus Christ. - Well, where are you gonna find men in a small town? - A bar, but like I said- - No, besides a bar. - Look, if I wanna play 20 questions, I would've stayed home with Paco. You got any ideas, or you just talking 'cause you're scared? - You never give men any credit for brains, Carmen. - Show me some brains and I'll give you plenty of credit. You know where to find men? - Yes, I do. You want men, here we are. - You want credit, I give you credit. (car doors banging) Hello? Anybody home? - [Jim] Be right with you. - Where's the firemen? - Where's the fire? - This is the firehouse, right? There's supposed to be firemen here. - It's a volunteer firehouse, one man on duty. I got a fire, I call the others. So you got a fire, ladies? - We've got something better than a fire. - Us. We, we're hot, baby. We're very, very hot. - Passionate, you know what I'm saying? - We're looking for some action, you interested? - Absolutely. - $50. - For what? - For the action. What do you think we're doing, selling magazine subscriptions? - You mean you're hookers? - $30. - She meant $50. We're worth 50 bucks. Well worth it. - I never said you weren't, but you're putting me on. You're not hookers. - Well, not full time, but- - Kathy, shut up. Look. We need money, bad. What do you say? - I say you're beautiful. Both of you, you want some coffee? - We want some money. - Jesus, you need money that bad? (Carmen sighing) - Only if we wanna eat. - You girls aren't whores. - What, you wanna see our union cards? - If you need money, why don't you get a job? - You got a job? - [Jim] I know where you might be able to get one, you ever tend bar? - Yeah, I'm good at it. - A girl at the Sunset left this afternoon. Lemme make a call. - Hey, thanks. You're a nice guy. (car horn honking) (muzak playing) You still working? You're supposed to be off at seven, I gotta be at the bar by eight. - I know, I just gotta finish this one aisle, okay? - What, he's making you work overtime? Well, you getting time and a half? - No, but I do get a choice, do it or get another job. I was a little late getting to work this morning. - Hey man, check it out. That girl. That's what I call a lousy thief. When I used to do this, oh shit. - We prosecute shoplifters here. Marcia, call the police, I've got a shoplifter. - Shit, she's busted. What the fuck? She's having a fit, quick, help! Help, help, help me! Come on. Oh, it's real bad. Oh my god. - My cousin gets these epileptic episodes too. (Kathy sighing) Are you feeling better? - Yeah, I'm fine now. I'll just finish stocking this shelf. - Oh, no! - No, no, no, no, no, forget about the shelves. Just go home, rest. - Thank you. I saw it in a movie. - Princess, I don't know, sometimes you got cojones. - Seemed like the right thing to do. (gentle music) - [Carmen] Woo! (laughing) (relaxed music) - So how's it going? - You know, I thanked you a million times, but thanks again. You saved my butt. - I'm glad I was able to help. Your butt's worth saving. (Carmen laughing) You look real nice tonight, you don't mind my saying so. - Why should I mind? You say I look like a dog, that I mind. - There's no way you could ever look like a dog. Would you like to dance? ♪ For such sweet loving ♪ ♪ Loving like I might never know again ♪ ♪ Oh, babe ♪ ♪ Please don't let it ever end ♪ ♪ I must be dreaming ♪ - Come on, you're gonna miss the school bus. - Good, I hate that school. - I don't remember any school that you loved. - Yeah, but this one I hate the most, the teacher thinks I'm stupid. - You're not stupid. You don't read so good yet, but you're not stupid. - I don't care. Frank don't read so good, and he ain't stupid. - Get in the car. Frank, who's Frank? - I told you 1,000 times, Frank is- - Oh please, get in the car, we're late. (engine rumbling) (upbeat music) (tires screeching) (singing in foreign language) I'll wait with you. - [Paco] No, it's embarrassing. - [Carmen] Hey, come here. (Carmen kissing) - [Paco] Get outta here. - Paco, you're not stupid. - Go on, get going. (engine rumbling) (singing in foreign language) - [Kathy] Get him on the bus? - Yeah. You know what he told me? That his teacher thinks he's stupid. I bet the bitch says that 'cause he's Mexican. - Come on, you always think it's some sort of racist thing. There are other Mexican kids in his school, he told me so. - Yeah, three or four fruit pickers. Kids she probably thinks are all stupid too. - Oh, jeez. - [Carmen] Any more coffee left? (upbeat music) - Oh Jesus. I miss Lyle. - Yeah. I miss Richie too. You know what? I kinda like the idea of missing him. - It is romantic. Sometimes, I really miss him, you know? It hurts. - You know, Lyle's not the only guy in the world. - He is to me. Nobody knows me the way he does. He looks in my eyes, I know he sees the me inside, you know? I've never had that with anybody else. I think we must've been lovers in another lifetime, you know? - Another lifetime, you believe that shit? - Don't you? You know, when Lyle would come to pick me up, my dad would lock all the doors and I'd have to climb out the bedroom window. One time, my dad said to me, "Kathy, if you go with him, we won't know you. You won't be our daughter anymore." So I left with him. That was it, there was never any question. - That's so romantic. I don't know whether to cry or puke. (laughing) - Hi, how you doing, Frank? - Hey, Paco. - I didn't have to go to school today, so I decided to come and give you a hand. How's Sampson and Louie Louie? (Sampson growling) What's the matter with him? - He's hungry. He and Louie Louie haven't eaten in a couple of days. - So are we gonna feed him now? - Feed him with what? You think all I gotta do is open up a couple of cans of cat food? I told you, these guys eat 30, 40 pounds of red meat at a time. - So then what are we gonna do? You know, about feeding 'em? - Hey, did I tell you? We might have a new TV series. Yeah, I'm waiting to hear from a guy I know in LA. (Sampson growling) (Frank sighing) - [Kathy] Dressing up, are we? What's the occasion? - Hm? - [Kathy] I need the car, I've gotta be at work by three. - I'm not taking the car. - Somebody's picking you up? - Hm. - Are you gonna answer my question, or are you just gonna keep hmm-ing at me? Where are you going? - A friend is coming by, no big deal. He wants to show me something. Don't ask me what, 'cause I don't know what it is. - You've got a date? - What are you talking about, a date? Jim's coming by, if you gotta know everything. Mother of god, it's my day off. - [Kathy] I was just asking, pardon me. - You think it's wrong, me going out with him? - I don't know anything. Gonna tell Richie? - I might, I might not. Listen. Richie's gonna be locked up for two years plus. What am I supposed to do, become my mother? - Ah, you do what's right for you. Gonna make it with him? - What? Make it with who? How do I know? No. I might. If I want to, I will. Why, do you think I shouldn't? - Well, I wouldn't do that to Lyle. - But you were ready to fuck a bunch of firemen a couple of weeks ago. - That was entirely different and you know it. - Okay, suppose that it was the other way around, and you were in jail, you don't think Lyle would be stepping out on you? Tell the truth. - He might I guess. - You guess? - I don't know, god. Look, all I'm saying is that what's right for me might not be right for you. - Why do you live way out here with the rattlesnakes? A cool guy like you. - I don't like it in the cities anymore. I used to be a real firefighter. I worked out in Newark for 12 years, and loved it. I was saving people's lives, I was no big hero, but I felt like I was doing something worthwhile. - So what changed your mind? - Ran into one too many burning tenements that had been set on fire for the insurance. - So stupid. - Tell me about it. I finally had to come out here to get a breath of clean air. (Barney whistling) Hey, Barney. - Hi, Jim. - Want a ride? We're heading home. - [Barney] No, thank you kindly anyway. - Find anything? - There's nothing out here to find, kid. - I've been telling you that for years, Barney, but I believe you know better. Got a gold mine out here somewhere, don't you? - There's no gold out here. All there is is a bunch of nosy folks like you spying on a man. - Well, you take care, Barney, and watch out for them spies. - [Barney] Spying on a man, that's all that's out there. (Barney whistling) (Carmen laughing) - [Jim] Pretty nice, right? - [Carmen] It's weird. What the hell is it? - [Jim] It's a movie set. Desert's full of 'em. I found it a couple of years ago, they left everything, even the trailers, and they're so nice, I moved into one. - [Carmen] You're the sheriff here, stranger? - And the mayor, and the bartender, and everyone else, little lady. Welcome to Rattlesnake Jim's paradise by the sea. (saloon door creaking) - Ah, what sea? This is a desert. - So that's why the swimming is so lousy. (gentle music) (Carmen sighing) (water bubbling) How long is your old man in for? - Two and a half, if he don't fuck up. You ever been in the joint? (Jim laughing) - I woke up in the drunk tank a couple of times, but nothing serious. You? - Yeah. Juvenile. Was a long time ago. - For what? - Chicken shit stuff. (laughing) Then I got knocked up with Paco, and that was the end of my life in crime. (engines revving) What can I tell you? I don't like jail. - Oh no. Oh no, no, no! - What? (engines revving) - ATVs. Let 'em crash, let 'em burn, let 'em explode, dammit. - What are ATs or whatever? - All fucking terrain vehicles. They're tricycles with fat rubber tires and motors and fat people ride 'em all over the desert. They ride 'em in places where not a human being has stepped in a million years. God, I hate 'em, I hate 'em so goddamn much. - Yeah, I get that feeling. Why are they visiting us? - They're canny old people. - How you doing? That's a hot spring, Billy. - It's a gift from God. - Yeah, we're church-going people ourselves. - And what church is that? (woman gasping) (Billy laughing) - Hey, cover yourself, can't you see there's a kid here? - Can't you see there's people here? Haven't you ever heard of the word privacy? - You're a freak, mister. Have a good time. Unfriendly assholes! (engines revving) (somber music) - It used to be a magic place. Now, they're gonna destroy it. Every place they go, they destroy. And they go fucking everywhere. - You should build a wall around this place. Don't let those people bring you down. Just let it go. - We gonna do it right here? - [Lyle] So, you seeing anybody? - Lyle, you keep asking me that, and I keep telling you I love you. I don't go out with other guys. (inmates chatting) - I believe you. You shouldn't even be out here in the first place, living in some grungy trailer in the middle of the fucking desert, you know? You should be back in Beverly Hills with your people. - Look, I'm not the one who got you busted, Lyle. You did that, and you're taking it out on me. - I'm not listening to this shit. - Well, you'd better listen to it. You screwed it up. Jesus, do you think this is how I wanna be with you? In this place? Do you think that's my idea of love? - Look, I just want you to go, okay? - No. - I really think you should go. - No. (Lyle sighing) (Kathy sighing) - Every weekend, I wake up with knots in my stomach, afraid you're not gonna show up. I just can't believe my luck. A fuck up like me. And I have you. I'm just scared I'm dreaming it all, and it's gonna go away. I love you. - I know. - What'd your mom's boyfriend do? - The cops set him up, but he shot his way out. Almost. - Kill anyone? - Couple of cops. Not killed 'em, you know, but shot 'em up. (baby crying) - Keep it decent. - Let's go for a walk. - Your job okay? I mean, you got enough money and stuff? - We get by. - Well, when I get outta here, it's gonna be a different story, you can count on it, baby. What, you don't believe me? - I always believe you. I have to believe you. I don't want to be visiting Paco in here 10 years from now. - What are you talking about Paco in the joint for? He's a good kid. - It's got nothing to do with it. There's this prison psycho syndrome thing, you know? The father figure's a con, the kid becomes a con. Like, following in his footsteps. Do you know what I'm saying? - Well, what I'm saying is, when I get outta here, I'm never coming back, Carmen. It's a straight job is all I'm interested in. A family, with you and Paco, and a straight fucking lunch bucket job. And this time, it's different. - You're right. It is different. You're gonna make it this time. I do believe you. - You're the best, baby. You know, I can see right through your eyes, straight to your heart. - What do you see? - I see a great orange ball of fire. (soft music) I'm blinded by the light, it's so bright, and so hot. - I've never, ever loved a man more than I love you. Do it to me, Richie. Right across this table. Look into my eyes and do it to me. - Oh god, I'm doing it to you. - I know, I can feel it. - Oh god. (Carmen and Richie sighing) (Richie laughing) (Richie and Carmen laughing) (Richie groaning) Oh. You got a cigarette. (gentle music) - [Police Guard] All right people, come on, cool off. Let's go, break it up. (music intensifying) Lyle. What's the matter, you don't hear so good? Let's go, move out. Put your clothes back on, sweetie. (people chatting) (bird screeching) - Can I ask you a question? - What? - Did you tell Richie that you went out with Jim? - I started to and then I changed my mind. - You know, Lyle doesn't believe me when I tell him I don't go out with other guys. Does Richie ever get on you about that? - Richie doesn't ask me about those things, he's not stupid. Well, he's a little stupid, but he's not that stupid. And it's a good thing, because, you know, you can't tell a guy shit. He don't believe you no matter what they say. Show up with your pussy sewn shut, they still don't believe you ain't screwing somebody. Kathy, it's Lyle's problem, not yours. - I wish I could be the way you are. - [Carmen] What way is that? - Just the way you accept life, and all the shitty things that happen. You don't let it bother you. - How the hell do you know what bothers me? (coyote howling) (engine rumbling) - What the hell is this? Where the fuck is the trailer? - Two IRS men dropped by and towed it. We're evicted. Refers to your lawyer, Roy Strap, he forgot to pay his taxes. - Evicted, but they can't do that, I mean, we live here, this is our home. - Yeah, that's exactly what I told 'em, but you know what? They went ahead and did it anyway. - Shit. - I cried when they drove away like a little baby. I haven't done that in years. When we got here, it was a dump and we hated it, let's just find another dump that we hate. - Oh god, Paco's gonna be so upset. This is not fair, Carmen, this is not fucking fair. - Fair, you expect fair? Where've you been all your life? Hey, come on. Let's saddle up. It's time to move on. (upbeat music) (saw scraping) We came to live with you. That okay? - Absolutely. (birds singing) (Carmen screaming) - Oh my god. - It's all right, it's only a king snake. - It's not all right, it's a fucking snake, Kathy. - I've been reading about the animals up here. This is a king snake, he doesn't bite, he won't hurt you, look. - It doesn't have to bite me to hurt me, he could kill me with a heart attack. - Come on, he's more afraid of us than we are of him. - You speak for yourself, and you keep that thing away from me. - Kinda neat, you know? They're not slimy like you think. - That's sick. - They're dry and smooth. Feel sorta sensual, you know? - You need to get laid right away. - Yeah, I do miss Lyle, a lot. - Don't gotta tell me that. You just picked up a snake and took it for a walk. Remember when we first got here? A little mouse sent you through the roof. Now you're like this nature girl or something. - Will you give me your honest opinion about something? - I don't know. - It's about Lyle. You know, I keep trying to imagine my life without him. Three years of not waking up next to him. Three years before he kisses my breasts. Keep trying to imagine it and I can't. So I think I've figured out a way to cool him out. You know, about me going out with other guys and stuff. You know what I'm gonna do? - No, tell me. - I'm gonna marry him. You think I'm crazy? - What do I know? (gentle music) (man whistling) ♪ If it wasn't for you ♪ ♪ Where would I be ♪ ♪ If it wasn't for you ♪ - Dearly beloved, we're gathered together to join Kathy and Lyle in the bonds of matrimony. - Where did he get the suit? - I gave his regards to that busted guy over there. - It fits so beautiful, like it was made for him. - [Chaplain] Whose soul is purified by their love, transcend all corporal barriers and fly free to that non-judgemental heaven, where true love acknowledges no prison. True love, the key that opens all doors, dissolves all bars. ♪ We'll make a new start ♪ ♪ Thank my lucky stars ♪ (people applauding) - [Carmen] Kiss, kiss! (gentle music) - That's our honeymoon suite. I asked one of them married guys about it, he says it's just like a regular apartment. You got a living room, a bathroom, bedroom, kitchen, microwave, and a regular stove. Color TV, no cable. - I don't think we're gonna be watching a lot of TV, are we? - I sincerely doubt it. - They've let me bring in 10 condoms. That's the most you can bring in for a conjugal visit. It's kind of a dirty word, condom. - Gets me hot. - When can we get in there? - Hey, I know my name's on that list, sir, I put my name on that list. - It's not there. - Well, would you look again please? Sir, the rules say if you get married, you're entitled to regular married visits, that's regular 72 hour married visits, okay? You wanna take a look at it for yourself, huh? - I know the rules, son. Thank you kindly all the same. - We were just married. You know that, warden, you kissed me after the ceremony. We're entitled to some- - To 72 hour visiting privileges. The use of one unit of conjugal quarters on an as available basis. That means when we got an empty unit. There's a list, son, you gotta wait your turn, that's all I'm saying. I'd have thought you'd know that. - I put my name on your goddamn list. - Subject to availability. - We were just married. - I know, don't seem fair, but there it is. Now, I can't do anything this weekend, of course, everything's all filled up, but I'm gonna put you down for the 28th, the weekend of the 28th, that's June 28th. - June 28th, that's three, that's four goddamn weeks from now, that's four weeks! - It's the best I can do, Lyle. - It's gonna be okay, you hear me? We'll be all right. - We'll get up, too, honey. We'll make it up to each other. - Bye. - Bye. (somber music) (gentle music) Bye. - Opening door, convict coming through. - I love you too. - Come on, let's move it. Closing the door. (door clanking) Locking up. (slide guitar music) - What's the matter, you can't sleep? - I'm married. - How about that? Congratulations. (people speaking in foreign language) (convicts chatting) (door banging) - Hey Lyle. You and your fist enjoying your honeymoon? Ah, feel bad? Think how bad your bride must feel, huh? You know, I get off work in an hour, you want me to pay her a visit, do the honors for you? - Fuck off. - Don't you tell me to fuck off, I'll put you on report. Just offering you a favor. Now, you ain't doing her no good in here. She looked real hot to me. I could cool her off for you. - You're too fat and too old to cool anything down. My girl wouldn't look at you. - You know, I'd think she'd like me just fine. Any girl marries an asshole like you ain't picky. I'll go real slow, make it last. - I kill you! I'll rip your balls out! You go near here, I'll kill you! (men shouting) I'll kill you! You stay away! You stay away from her, I'll kill you, you hear me? - [Guard] How do you like this? (Lyle screaming) (somber music) (cows mooing) (gun banging) (gun banging) (winch whirring) (hatchet banging) (saw scraping) - All right, stretch the leg out there, as far as it goes, yeah, that's it. (Paco groaning) (engine rumbling) - [Paco] Who's that? - Take off, boy. Now! Something I can do for you? - I believe you know the answer to that, mister. Those are my cows you're butchering over there. - Well, I don't think you can prove a goddamn thing. And you're on private property right now. My private property. - My cows. Wearing my brand, and don't be telling me what I can prove, I saw you shoot 'em! - The day you put the law on me will be the sorriest day you ever saw dawn, and I'm not gonna tell you again, you are trespassing. - I never said nothing about going to no law. I settle my own disputes. Now, I'm taking those carcasses back. - You try it, and you're gonna be as dead as that meat. My cats are starving. Leave off. Old man, put the gun away, I'm giving you fair warning. - I don't scare. (gun clicking) - Neither do I. (gun clicking) (gun banging) (gunshots banging) (old man groaning) (tense music) Oh Jesus, what did I do now? It was self-defense. Law of the jungle, I had no choice. - We'd better hide his body. - No, leave him where he is. - You'll go to jail. - If they find me, maybe. There's still some places a man can go. You be smart, kid, you didn't see any of this. You were on your way home, and you heard the shooting, and it's all you know, all right? - I won't rat on you, Frank. - Never thought you would. (sultry music) - What happened? Are you okay, did you break anything? He's in shock, are you in shock? Ay, Dios mio. - Oh my god. - Where is all this blood coming from? - Make him lie down, I'm gonna get the bandages. - I'm okay, I'm okay. It ain't my blood, we butchered a couple of cows for Sampson and Louie Louie. - You were playing with lions, when you're supposed to be in school? (slap thudding) - Ow. - The man from the school came here today, he told me that you know you're not getting to high school. You missed too many days, they're not going to graduate you. (slaps banging) - Ow, ow, ow. - You're bad. Don't you put your hands on me. This is not your child. - Jesus, Carmen, you're gonna hurt him. - Don't you tell me what to do with my kid. You're supposed to go to school. You wanna end up in jail like the rest of the dummies? - Richie ain't a dummy! - Richie is the dummiest of the dummies! - Stop it Carmen, Jesus! - Who are you? Is that your kid? You got something to say? He don't go to school, he lies to me. - Let him go. He's just scared. - He's got plenty to be scared of. And what are you standing in my way for? Stay out of my family. - But I'm your family too, Carmen. - You're what? My family? What, are you crazy? (Carmen crying) What am I gonna do? He wasn't listening to me no more. (Carmen crying) (gentle music) (Barney whistling) (birds screeching) - If there's someone out there, I'm warning you, I'm armed. And I will shoot any son of a bitch who tries to follow me. - I don't know what I'm gonna do about Paco. You know, no school? He's gonna be running around free all summer. - Carmen, he's been running around free all winter. It's a good place to be 12 years old. It's a lot better than where I grew up. - Any time you wanna trade poor people's troubles for rich people's troubles, you let me know. - Carmen, I'm scrubbing clothes in a tin tub and you're talking to me about rich people? I'm having my honeymoon in a jail. - Well, you had a choice. You didn't have to marry a hustler. - Listen, some women fuck up, I fuck down. A flaw in my character. - Ha. I know. - Paco's gonna be all right. You think this is too corny? - I didn't think so when I bought it. - Oh yeah, sorry. (laughing) Can I borrow it? - It's honeymoon time, anything you want, girlfriend. - Thank you Carmen, you're a sweetheart. I have never waited so long for four weeks to pass. 72 hours of marital bliss. I am going to blow that man's mind. (Barney whistling) (Barney groaning) - Oh my god. Oh. (Barney groaning) Oh my god. (Barney gasping) - You okay? - No. I'm dying. - Look, I'll go get some help, okay? - I'll be dead before you get back. - So then what should I do? - When I die, you want my map? To where my goldmine is? Come here, will you take, take off my boot? Take off the boot. (somber music) - [Richie] What's up, Paco? - I'm sorry to have to tell you this, missy, but Lyle's in isolation. That means no visiting privileges. - But our wedding night, our conjugal visit. - He blew it. He tore up his cell, attacked the guards. - When can I see him? When can we have our honeymoon? When can I see my husband? - When he starts obeying the rules of this institution, now it's as simple as that. (Kathy sighing) (tense music) (rattlesnake rattling) (insects chirping) (saloon door creaking) - The hell happened to you? - Nothing good. Nothing. - You're supposed to be tucked up with Lyle. - Yeah, supposed to be. Carman, sometimes I don't think I can take it anymore. I don't think I want to. - Come on. Have a sit down. Tell me what's going on, okay? I'll get us a drink. - Okay. - Two weeks, I've been asking Jim to fix the fucking generator so we can have some cold beer. Has he fixed it? No. For sitting in the bar, he's got time. For running around the desert, plenty of time. Here, we'll drink it warm. - What the hell. Warm's better than hot. - My sister, you are learning. (tense music) - Yes. (magical music) Goldmine. A true goldmine. - Life's supposed to work, but you never get the instructions, like you do with a VCR. Some people get that, you know, that booklet. I always wanted that. - It was gonna be so beautiful. And that nightie you lent me, Carmen, it was so sexy. - Oh honey, you're still gonna wear it, don't you worry about nothing. - Mom, we're rich! - Oh, Pacito, give mama a big kiss. Give Kathy one too, she's a little depressed. - Rich, I found a fucking goldmine. - Oh Pacito, don't swear, it's not nice. - Now Richie won't have to steal no more, and we can all stay here together. - Oh, why not? You found a tiger, a lion, an elephant. - No elephants, there was no elephant. - Why not a goldmine? - All right, you don't have to believe me, I can show it to you, I got a map from this old guy, he died. - Oh, it's okay, Pacito, we don't need no goldmine. I love you so much. And that's better than gold. - I lost it! - You lost something, hon? - My map, my treasure map. It must've fallen outta my pockets when I was climbing down the rocks. Well, that's okay, I know how to find the place again. - That's good. - By the Indian head rock, that's where it is. So, come on, I'll show you. - Ay, Pacito, I can't move. - Okay, I'll show you tomorrow. I can find it again, I know where it is. Come on, I'll take you there. - Now? - You got something better than a goldmine? (tense music) - Shit, ATVs. - What the hell is this place? - This is our home. - You own this place? - I told you, we live here. - Well, if you don't own it, it's public property, and we're the public, so we have just as much right to be here as you. - Look, it's a big desert. Why don't you just leave us alone? - We're not ready to go yet. (gun clicking) - Oh, lookie here, an armed man! He's got himself a .22! You wanna see what we got? (guns clicking) Wanna talk firepower, asshole? I got 30 rounds. I could fire faster than you can pull that trigger. Don't be threatening us with a BB gun. - Okay, everybody put their guns down now. - Jim, do it. Jim. (gun banging) (Carmen and Kathy screaming) - Just so you know what these babies can do. - You wave that candy piece of shit at us again, I'll carve you a new asshole. (tense music) - We're going now. Not because you told us to, but because we want to. You better get a little more firepower before you give us any orders. Ciao, baby. (tires screeching) - All right, that's it. - What, you're gonna go do something stupid? - I told you I was going hunting. - Stay here, stay here. - I am going with Jim. - Paco! (engine rumbling) - Hey Jim! Jim. - Not now, Paco, I'm sorry, but I got things to do. (engine rumbling) (engine rumbling) (engines rumbling) (tense music) (men whooping) (explosion banging) (men screaming) (rock thudding) (somber music) - [Jim] It's war now, you barbarians! Rattlesnake Jim is making his stand. (coyote howling) (gentle music) - I love this little ball. Every time I see it, I love it more and more. You know what? What's worrying me though, is baby names. I got this list here I been working on, I want you to take a look and tell me if any of it knocks you out. - What worries me is that the baby's gonna be nearly a year old when you get out, and what are we gonna do then? - You're right, I know, and I've been giving that some very serious thought. - And? - Well, I'm still thinking, you know? I'm turning possibilities over in my head. - Like what, for example? - Well, lots of stuff, you know? I mean, good opportunities. I mean, I know for sure that I don't wanna take no state job 'cause that's just dead end city, and I want something where I can get ahead. - Good. - We got no more trouble from those ATV people. They don't come anywhere near us. They think we mined the whole desert. (Jim laughing) - I wish I had. - Trouble with this guy is he's a fucking elitist. Jim, the desert belongs to everyone, everyone's got the right to enjoy it. - Not if they're gonna screw it up, they don't. - Yeah, well what you're saying is you got the right to decide who's screwing it up and who's just enjoying it, man. Modern times, people like to ride around on those ATVs. - No, what I'm saying is that nobody's got the right to ruin paradise, and the desert is paradise. It's the last one we got left. - Bullshit. - Hey, I know that guy. - He's a new fish, he's in for tax fraud. - That's Lyle's hotshot lawyer. - Yeah, we got a lot of lawyers in here. Is there anymore potato salad? - I can get this case reopened for illegal search and seizure. I'm not gonna charge you an arm and a leg either, that I promise you. You have a warrant on your house? - Yeah. - You own the car? - Hey, how you doing, Frank? - Oh, pretty good, Pac. How about you? You find the gold mine yet. - [Paco] I'm still looking. - Good for you, buddy. - I just don't understand how that Indian head rock disappeared. - Well, there's lots of mysteries out there. Lots of strange shit going down. (upbeat music) - [Kathy] Listen to this. Lyle wants Lyle Jr. If it's a boy, and Lyla if it's a girl. (Kathy and Carmen laughing) - [Carmen] You gotta name this kid for a saint so somebody's looking on. They're on duty 24 hours. - [Kathy] Well, who's the patron saint of the baby conceived during a conjugal visit? - [Carmen] That would be Saint Rita. Go with it, Kathy, you can't be too careful. - [Kathy] What if it's a boy? - [Carmen] Call him Jesus, then he's covered. - [Kathy] But I'm not Catholic, Carmen. - [Carmen] So name him Elvis. ♪ Car ♪ ♪ Turn ♪ ♪ Over ♪ ♪ One more time ♪ ♪ Heart ♪ ♪ Roll ♪ ♪ Over ♪ ♪ And play alive ♪ ♪ There isn't gonna be a car chase, is there ♪ ♪ There isn't gonna be a heartbreak, is there ♪ ♪ Car ♪ ♪ Turn ♪ ♪ Over ♪ ♪ One more time ♪ ♪ Are you following me ♪ ♪ Or am I following you ♪ ♪ Across the line across the moon ♪ ♪ Too slow ♪ ♪ Too soon ♪ ♪ Around the bend, around the room ♪ ♪ Too slow ♪ ♪ Too soon ♪ ♪ Across the line across the moon ♪ ♪ Across the line across the moon ♪ ♪ Too slow ♪ ♪ Too soon ♪ ♪ Oh, it's time to go ♪ ♪ Stars ♪ ♪ Start ♪ ♪ Shooting ♪ ♪ I wish I may ♪ ♪ Night ♪ ♪ Star ♪ ♪ Falling ♪ ♪ I wish I might ♪ ♪ Looks like there'll be a pretty sunset ♪ ♪ Are we almost in it ♪ ♪ Are you following me ♪ ♪ Or am I following you ♪ ♪ Across the line across the moon ♪ ♪ Too slow ♪ ♪ Too soon ♪ ♪ Around the bend, around the room ♪ ♪ Too slow ♪ ♪ Too soon ♪ ♪ Across the line across the moon ♪ ♪ Across the line across the moon ♪ ♪ Too slow ♪ ♪ Too slow ♪ ♪ Oh, it's time to go ♪
