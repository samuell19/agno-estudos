We searched everywhere, we couldn't find him. I've been hearing this past one month. A new officer has come to my husband's place. But you are not telling him the truth even now. - Sir. Sir, my husband is missing since one month. He has been to nab Saleem. But he is not investigating. Listen, I know everything. Will you listen to me? - Yes. Forget your husband. I will get you a lot of money. Take the money and keep your mouth shut. Hey, if you go missing someday.. ..will you wife keep her mouth shut taking money? You scoundrel. In the greed of money, you're selling your conscience. The police is not helping me. I have to go to Saleem. It is not easy to meet Saleem. Come, I will drop you home. There were arms in the box. Who are you? Inspector's Raja Rao's wife. Where is my husband? - 'Where is my husband?' Small words sound so sweet. "Where is he?" It won't make any difference if I answer one question. You will come up with another question. What will the question be? Who? Why? What? How? Questions like these will make me angry. Hey. Tell me. Answer me. Other, I will slit your throat. Where is my husband? - Only I know where he is. If you won't slit my throat.. ..maybe I will.. ..pity you and tell you the truth. Get away. Being a policeman, when your husband couldn't do anything to me.. ..what can you do? Hey, we killed her husband. Bury her alive. What? You killed my husband? You scoundrel. How dare you abuse me? Take her away.; Hey. Did you find her? - No, she isn't here. Look properly. - Okay. Find her. We're looking for her. - All right. She can't get away. Find her soon. She shouldn't get away. She shouldn't get away. Find her. Look properly. Did you find her? - No, we haven't She must be hiding somewhere around. Find her. Where is she? Did you find her? Why don't answer me? Why are you quiet? Ravi, did you find her? There is a big snake here. Let's get out of here. My husband was an honest police officer, what is a sin? The person who fulfills his duty sincerely.. ..is this the consequence he faces in this world? Those who must arrest the culprits.. ..are actually protecting them. Who will punish such people? I'm the wife of a person who brings justice. When injustice is happening with me.. ..what about You? Will you watch the wreckage quietly? Whenever sins increase in this world, you come back to this earth. Then why have You become a statue today? Come. Protect the world. You won't come. Will You come from this statue? Will You come from the sky? Will you come from this earth? Where will You come from? Answer me. Where..? You will come from my stomach? Left. Right. Left. Right. Left. Right. Catch her. She shouldn't get away. Catch her. Boss. She drowned into the water. Come, let's go. Don't leave behind evidence. Just for a single woman.. ..ten goons. Life is too short. She died. We must get the road contract this time. If anyone interferes, then.. - God. I think it's a tiger. Let's go fast. - Run. Run, everybody. Son. Son. Son. Son. Like it is a fact that rain falls from the sky.. ..like it is a fact that water in the sea goes up the sky becoming steam.. ..similarly, my son Karamveer Pratap.. ..will become a police officer and serve this country. It is a fact. Minister's here. Start. Vikram calling, no.1. - Are you done? Yes, done. - Darn it. David, move. Darn it. Oh my god. Stop. Stop. No. Stop. Darn it. In the terrorist attack on our Prime Ministers in Thailand.. ..a phone was found in the coat of a terrorist who died. Inspector Karamveer Pratap.. ..has produced evidence that Nixon was behind the attack. The investigation is on. Due to this information, the international police.. ..has handed over this case to the Interpol. The Interpol surrounded the Nixon.. ..he was killed in an encounter while trying to flee. Because prime accused Nixon died.. ..no other evidence were found. The Interpol had to close the case forcefully. When I was on a tour to Thailand.. ..the person who saved my life.. ..is courageous IPS officer Karamveer Pratap. Mr. Karamveer, please come on the stage. I have a request for you, sir. I'd like to say something on the mike on this occasion. Please, sir. Of course, Mr. Karamveer. It's not been too long since I became a police officer. But today, I'm being honored with medals and trophies. All of us are fulfilling our duties very well. The law and order is under control. People are feeling safe. There are no riots. This is what we believe. It is really true. Have you ever thought what the common people think about us? The police.. I just can't say how badly we get abused. We wake up every morning, bathe.. ..wear the uniform, fill free petrol in the jeep.. ..and get salary on the 1st of every month. I can't do that. I, Karamveer Pratap cannot lead such a life. There are several problems. But what is the solution to these problems? If a student doesn't study well, the teacher is blamed. If the son doesn't behave himself, the elders are blamed. If the public do illegal business, the police is blamed. Sir, if you want to give me something then give me a police team. Like there is a police station in every area.. ..I want a telephone booth in even shanty, in every street. The common people will drop in a coin.. ..and tell us in which police station.. ..their complaints have not been accepted. It'll then be my responsibility. I'll get to that police station with my team. The officer who is related to that case.. ..I will make him understand in my style. People will call and complain, I'll then take immediate action. But nobody will question me. I should be given all the control. Not even the President and.. ..the Prime Minister of the country should stop me. This is what I believe. Please give me a team to change India, sir. - Is it possible? If every policeman of the country does his duty sincerely.. ..we can make everything possible, sir. We can make everything possible. Hail India. Sir. Why are you annoying? - Money got stolen. Am I sitting idle here? I had saved my hard earned money for my daughter's marriage. When did the theft take place? - 10 o'clock, sir. Is it 10 am or 10 pm? Tell me clearly. 10 pm, sir. - Sir, one minute. MLA is on the line. Sir. Greetings, sir. What? Your brother-in-law's bag got lost? Which area? Dharavi? I'll look into the case right away. Who is the head goon of Dharavi? - Afzal. - Call him. Hello. Is Afzal there? MLA's bag got lost. What time? What time, sir? 7 o'clock. - Morning or evening? Morning or evening? Morning. - 7 am. Where is Dharavi? - Where is Dharavi, sir? Near taxi stand. - Near taxi stand. What? You found two bags? Color? - Black color? Not blue, black color. Video camera and.. - 1 lakh? 1 lakh? 1 lakh. Sir, we found the bag. You will get the bag in 1 1/2. Okay, sir. Thank you, sir. Listen, the bag should be in the police station in an hour. If you're late, you will die. Why are you standing here? My daughter's marriage will get cancelled. You tell me what should I do? Shall I make her my mistress? - Hey. How much money do you have? Only 1 rupee, sir. Old man, you think sir is a beggar? Get away. I don't want it. Look at that telephone booth. Drop the coin inside.. ..and tell all your problems. As it is, you have nothing to lose. Go. Sir, he is on screen one. - I want to talk to him. Dilip. - Sir. Sir. Why did you salute me? Since I'm your superior. Do you know who is superior to all of us? This elderly man. You know why? Since we get salary through his hard earned money. Why do we get salary every month? So that we protect our country men whenever they are in trouble. Someone stole the money he saved for his daughter's marriage. When he was here to complain, what did you tell him? What did you tell him about his daughter? Even you're someone's son, someone's husband and someone's father. You have good women in your life.. ..but you'll still make his daughter your mistress. Are you a policeman or a goon? Listen, if a girl's here to complain, she shouldn't fear of being raped. The theft victim shouldn't fear that the police will loot him. The public shouldn't fear us, but respect us. The problem is not in the police uniform. The problem is with corrupt officers who bring shame to it. Dilip. - Yes, sir. Jaffar. - Yes, sir. Water. Make a pledge. Raj.. Rajkumar Singha.. India.. India.. You forgot? Repeat after me. I, Rajkumar Singhania. - I, Rajkumar Singhania. I will always be honest towards my country and its law. I will always be honest towards my country and its law. I will be loyal towards the police department of the country. I will be loyal towards the police department of the country. I will serve the citizens of India without any partiality and fear. I will serve the citizens of India without any partiality and fear. I will respect the people's right written in the law. I will respect the people's right written in the law. I will fulfill my duty with sincerity and determination. I will fulfill my duty with sincerity and determination. I take this pledge with honesty. I take this pledge with honesty. You must be feeling at ease. - Yes. You're thinking how you will face God after death, right? Dilip. - Sir. God will forgive you only if you bring a smile on his face. To serve the public is our duty. Move. Send a circular to all the police stations that.. ..that those who come to complain should be treated as guests. Sir, I lost my bike. Don't worry. - My bike? I'm there. I guarantee you, nothing will happen to the bike. My bike. - Will you have coffee or tea? Can I get liquor? - No, coffee or tea? Coffee. Do you suspect anyone? - Boyfriend. Your boyfriend or your girlfriend's? He is boyfriend to both, sir. Here, it has all the details. Check it. Go home without worrying. Before 7:30 pm.. ..you will get your bike and boyfriend. Because of your son's justice, we got our land back. Please take this. - No, thanks. If you want to give me something.. ..give me a rose plant. Thank you. Sir. I lost one of my valuable things. - What is it? My heart. Sir, please stop. Do you love me or not? You can't leave without giving an answer. I have only one belief. Ever since I became a policeman, I believe that.. ..serving the public is my only duty. I don't want to lose focus falling in love. After marriage, I can't run behind my wife all day. I won't allow myself to lose focus.. ..from speed, force, spirit and sincerity falling in love. Will you never fall in love with anyone? Maybe. I might fall in love. If I find a lady police officer.. ..with similar mind-set, motivation and spirit as mine.. ..then maybe I might fall in love. Actually, sir wants a girl who is responsible not beautiful. Hey. Come quietly. Do you know I am? I'm Gabbar's grandson Babbar. - Get in, mother. My name is Babbar Sher. Sit. - Police. Police. Don't you watch films? The police arrives only after we're gone. Out with the stuffs. Don't you understand? Get up. Manager, out with the stuffs. Out with the money. Come on. Out with the money. God. - Shut up. How much for the rose? Give it. It is hard earned money. Kung Fu. You attack from behind? What? What are you looking at? Madam, please. Come on, clear the crowd. Get going. There's no shooting going on here. Get going. Come on, let's take them to the police station. Let's go home. Ever since I became a policeman.. ..I believe that serving the public is my only duty. Sir, will you pay us the money or not? - Coming. Baby. - Yes. I'm Sanjay Gila Ansari's first assistant. She's second and she's third. He won't start the shoot without us. The junior artists are waiting. If we don't go on time, he will kill us. Badshah. How am I as an actress? - Incredible. Absolutely real. You were like a real policewoman. - Isn't it? Yes. - Praise me more. Seeing your talks, your style, your speed.. ..the officer got mesmerized. - Yes. 'I do my duty sincerely.' 'I won't allow myself to lose focus from speed.. ..force, spirit and sincerity falling in love.' 'I do my duty sincerely.' 'I might fall in love.' Like he is running front and back as soon as I press the remote.. ..similarly, I wish to make him run behind me. Baby, make him run in the Olympics. But please pay the bill. - How much? Not much, after discount.. ..Rs.2000 for the jeep.. ..Rs.1000 for the siren.. ..Rs. 45000 for lady constables and fighters.. ..you broke glass worth Rs.45000. Rent for the shop Rs.25000. Total.. 105 lakhs. - Oh. So much at the very first attempt? Do you love money or the officer? - The officer. Badshah calling, coming. Who is coming? - He is coming. But where? - Behind you. Left. No. Right. Look into the mirror. Hello. Madhumati calling. Yes, everything is okay. Hello. Good morning. Hello. Are you firing bullets through your eyes? Do you know who I am? Inspector Madhumati. It is my job to shoot. I can take you to police station for eve teasing. Police station. Do you know who I am? - What will I do knowing you? Even if you are a big officer, I don't care. If there's no bad intention then what's wrong in seeing? What did you say? - I was watching you even yesterday. Don't you have mother and sister? I started gazing at you drastically. - I see. You thrashed them badly. - Oh. When you were thrashing the goons, an idiot came from behind. But you picked him and smashed him down hardly even without seeing him. We had done 50 rehearsals. The goon's head broke. That was really brilliant. I see. - That truly impressed me. I'm getting thrashed for no reason. Really brilliant. But I'm not here to talk about that. Yesterday, I saw you for the first time. I looked at you more closely after you got down the car. We met here again today. You and I saw each other many times. Hence, I couldn't avoid you. I think some natural power is bringing us close to each other. That's why we are meeting. Madhu. Sorry, Madhumati. This fan has a small wish. - What is it? Someday.. - Some day? You and I. - You and I? With you.. - With you? Sit with you.. - Sit with you? I wish to have piping hot coffee with you. He is done for. Coffee? - Yes, coffee. By the way, which police station? - Singham police station. Oh. - Everyone fear me in the police station. There is no need to salute in the public place. Okay? The department.. ..has great respect for me. You see. - That's good. You told me about yourself. Don't you want to know about me? Why should I know who you are? I don't wish to know about you. I always think about four people. - Who are they? Ramya, Sowmya, Kalia, Balia. - Who are they? Ramya, Sowmya, Kalia, Balia.. ..the four had come to police station this morning.. ..to lodge a complaint. And their complaint is.. ..that they don't want to marry, but they are forced to. This case if important for me. I don't care.. ..PM or the CM wants.. ..or what you want. Yes, true. Good. That's good. That's really good. Work is everything to you. Very impressive. That's really good. Waiter. - Yes, ma'am. Bill, please. - Okay, ma'am. I will pay the bill. Wait. Phone. - Sure. Hello. Sheila. You want my address? Note it down. Note it down properly. No.18, Pragati Nagar, Kapoor Colony. Will you remember? No, I will be out during the day. I will be at home after 8 pm. Yes. I got to nab the goons. Thanks for the coffee. - Welcome. All the best. - Thank you. Take care. - You too. Hey. Kapoor Colony. Yes. Hello? - Hi. What brings you here? - You'd forgotten this. Oh. - So, I'm here to give it to you. Kerchief. You'd forgotten it in the restaurant, so.. You came at such late hour to give it? You could've given it to me tomorrow? Actually, when someone's belonging goes missing before me.. ..I can't fall asleep without returning it. I couldn't hold myself, hence I'm here to give it. Are you here only to give kerchief? Yes. Oh. - Yes. Okay. Okay. Okay. - Okay. Okay. Hello. - Yes. Actually, what is it? Well.. - Is it love? Am I not handsome? No. The situation here is a little difference. It is about sincerity. Since I have pledged.. ..to serve the country becoming a police officer. They are my dialogues. Our think alike. So, will you never fall in love with anyone? I might fall in love. But the guy should be a police officer. Only then it will work. If you find a guy who's a police officer.. ..like you, will you then marry him? Yes, why not? See you tomorrow. Yes, let him come. I'm ready. Oh. Oh. Karamveer Pratap? Oh. Beauty who is on duty. Years ago, a small contractor named Saleem.. ..is popular with the name Al Saleem, a businessman. Saleem started his journey as a small contractor. But in 25 years, he has become no.1 businessman in the world. He has returned to this country after eight years. If Mr. Al. Saleem doesn't help us.. ..me and my party are nothing. I'm very happy today. If India is progressing, it's only because of Mr. Al. Saleem. It is my good fortune to be his business partner. He's responsible for me to became the Chief Minister of this state. Sir. - Yes. Inspector Madhumati is here. - Yes, I will be there. Hello, sir. - Hello. Who are you looking for, sir? - Inspector Madhumati. It's me. - What? Yes. I'm talking about Inspector Madhumati. - It's me. I'm talking about Inspector Madhumati, Singham Police Station. There is only one Kapoor Colony in our state. There is only one Singham Police station in Kapoor Colony. I'm the only unmarried woman Madhumati.. ..in that only police station, sir. Yes. Is there any other Madhumati who got transferred last week? This is the only state in our country India.. ..there is only one Kapoor Colony in this state.. ..there is only one Singham Police Station in Kapoor Colony.. ..and I'm Inspector Madhumati in that only police station.. ..who thrashes the goons. Are you sure? - Yes. Hero is here. Is the heroine ready? Go. - Lights, camera. Come on, catch me. Hurry up. Action. Tell me. Tell me where have you hidden it? Tell me where you have hidden Mr. Agarwal's dog's belt? I sold it. Is it? - Sorry. Who did you sell it? - I don't know. - Hi, Madhu. This is no time to love. This is time to work. Don't disturb me. - Yes. You have no time even for CM and PM. I think he found out. - What? Hit him. Hey, do you know who I am? Madhumati. Inspector Madhumati. - I know. Yes. Do you know who my father is? - Is he a constable? My father is D.I.G. - Really? Yes. - You never told me? I didn't get a chance. You have a chance today. I can help you in this case. - No. Will you get thrashed by her or get killed by me? If you thrash, my body will pain.. ..and if she thrashes me, I'll die. - Oh. No. This is my case. - Yes. I will solve it in my style. Do not interfere. - Yes. Okay. Okay. Start thrashing me. How did he find out? - Where did you hire the siren from? Thief market, Super market. I actually told the department.. ..to get me a new siren. The old one isn't working. Don't disturb me. Let me do my duty. Even I need to do my duty. Inspector Madhumati. - Yes, sir. My sister, you are here? - What? Are you my brother? Are our fathers different? - Yes. I was worried all these days.. ..thinking where did my other badge and belt go missing. But they were stolen by you. You thief. I won't spare you. - Look, I.. Is she your partner? - She is a good girl, sister. It's love. - Good girl? Why did you do this melodrama? Actually, I'm in love with him. - Shut up. He said he will fall in love only with a policewoman. - Shut up. I had no other option. - Shut up. Please come in. How did you get here? - Calm down. Who bailed you out? Listen.. - There's fish curry, chicken curry. Garnished with coriander and they're ready, husband. Husband? What husband? Mother-in-law. - What happened, daughter-in-law? Mother-in-law? - See, she made me her daughter-in-law. What's your problem? Mother, she is not a police officer. - I know. She is a cheat. No son, she lied to you. But her love is true. She loves you as much as you love your duty. Tell me. How much did you spend for my son? 5.4 lakhs. - Take your hand off. Don't scold her. Okay. Okay. I'm granting you the permission to stay here.. ..but you won't take advantage of it. Okay? - Okay. I need time to think. Okay. There's no need to say 'okay' for everything. Okay? - Okay. Okay. No one leaves disappointed from the police station.. ..after Karamveer's special team was formed. The relation between the police and the public is improving. She is on main screen, sir. - Let me see. Hello. I have a complaint. My son was in police, but has gone missing. I'd also lodged a police complaint. - Take her away. But nobody did anything. Sorry sir, she is a mental patient. Sorry. Go from here. You may think I mad. No son, to keep myself alive.. ..I'm pretending to be mad. So that, they don't kill me. I'm probably still alive to see an honest police officer like my son. Son, I request you. Will you find my son and bring him? When someone goes missing, we lodge a complaint in the police station. My son was a police officer himself. I lodged a complaint with a police officer.. ..about a police officer going missing. But no investigation was done. They couldn't see a mother's grief. There is a conspiracy behind it. It is a sin to make my son a good person? It is a sin to make my son a sincere and a hard working police officer? He is my only son. I pray all day long for his safety. If something happens to him.. ..I won't be alive. Like we drop some money in the donation box.. ..and share our sorrows with god.. ..similarly, people drop a coin into the phone box.. ..and share their sorrows with you.. ..so that, like god.. ..even you policemen help us. I beg of you.. ..to bring my son back. 'Who will punish them?' 'Will you watch the wreckage quietly?' Madam. Which police station have you lodged the complaint in? Inspector Hussain's mother lodged a complaint.. ..that her son is missing. What about it? We tried to find him, but in vain. So, the case is dismissed. Inspector Hussain's mother lodged a complaint that her son is missing. We tried to find him, but in vain. So, the case is dismissed. Inspector Hussain's mother lodged a complaint that.. - Sir. No matter how many times you ask this.. ..my answer will be the same. I don't want to hear the answer. I want to know the truth. Some say, they looked, but they didn't find him. Some don't search and say they did. I don't want to hear that nonsense. It was not a toy, but a policeman is missing. A policeman. Like you, we, and like us, a policeman. You closed the case for some money. - Enough now. Yes, it is true that I closed the case. But not because of money, but because of pressure. I didn't take their money. I may not be a good police officer.. ..but I'm proud that I'm honest. No one knows where our officer disappeared. Getting involved in this case.. ..I won't make my children as orphans. I fear death. Fear? You fear death? Ask yourself, are you alive? A human moves around, eats and drinks.. ..it doesn't mean he's alive. The one who lives without the fear of death.. ..only he is called as a true soldier. Everyone has to die some day. But what kind of society will we give our coming generation being a coward? Whenever you don't do your duty as a police officer.. ..don't hope to get justice for your daughter from someone else. We sow as we reap. Don't do anything by which you don't go to hell too. Reopen Hussain's file. - No, don't do it. Listen to me, please. Who called last on Hussain's phone? Everyone's betterment lies in forgetting this case. Who did Hussain meet before he vanished? Sir, why are you inviting trouble? Note down the phone number and get the address. - Don't invite death! This case was with you and you'll handle it. - No, I can't do it. You have to! - No, I can't! You can do it! If you try, you can! If you wish, you can make way through the mountains. If you wish, a tea vendor can become a PM. If you are strong, you can defeat death! We have to start the enquiry tomorrow. We are done with this deal. The profit margin will be three times more than we expected. And it is up to us to finalize the customer as well. Mr. Salim! - One minute. Paris.. - Yes, sir? Please, wait outside. - Alright. Have a seat.. Mr. Salim, Hussain's mother filed a complaint in police station. - Oh. After talking on phone from 23312233 Hussain left the house in hurry. He hasn't reached home since then. About Hussain.. - Excuse me. I have a question. Can I ask you? Since you've come here.. ..you've been talking about Hussain. Who is Hussain? He is an inspector. - Who? Inspector Hussain of three town circle station. Hussain was inspector. Tell me. This Hus.. 23312233 is your number. Hussain came to meet you and didn't return. Where's he? Where's he? Where's Hussain? - Where's Hussain? Where's he? Hussain.. Hussain received a call from your number. 2000 people work in this company. 2000 people come to meet these 2000 people. It is possible that someone would've called him. So, you didn't call Hussain? - You can think so. Did you call Hussain or not? - No. Okay? Go, I have lot of work to do. Salim, you'll have to make this discussion as statement and sign it. Tomorrow my constable will collect the papers from you, okay? Be ready. Let's go. Officer! How the country has to sleep and wake up.. ..and when to work, I decide all that. How did you do that? "Tomorrow my constable will collect the papers, you sign it". This is what you did. Who do you think I am? Do you think I'm your car driver! Am I a constable? This is your home? Is this your police station? What should I do? Should I salute you? Who do you think I am? You've come here wearing old shoes and dirty uniform. You dare to question me? You want me to answer you? You can ask questions, but when? Only when you have evidence of my involvement with you. E V I D E N C E. Evidence means proof. If you don't have proof.. ..then you can't question me. You will ask and I will answer you. But with respect.. not disrespectfully. Give me respect. Mr. Al Salim. Whatever we discussed, I have to make a statement. Can the constable come tomorrow to take your signatures? You just give him two minutes. Please. Listen, Karamveer. Why are you taking tension? Forget Hussain. He is not your relative. Don't think too much. Everyone has forgotten Hussain. You think so. Hussain's mother has not forgotten her son yet. I didn't forget the way she was crying in front of me. I will get justice to that helpless mother. Officer, I know everything. You want to see Hussain's mother happy, don't you? I have an idea. We will get any other dead body and prove that it's Hussain's. You support us and stay quiet. We will hand over that body to the government. We'll get money. Take the money. We'll give some of the money to Hussain's mother too. I'll kill you if you give me any wrong suggestions. ACP, show his dead body to the government and give some.. ..money to his mother. She'll feel at rest. - Hey! Officer! I'm your senior. Don't forget that! You don't force me to forget that you are senior to me. Listen officer, you are done with your investigation. Al Salim didn't call Hussain. Do you have any other evidence? Al Salim is lying. Al Salim is a liar. Do you know why Hussain is missing? Because he would've had the evidence of bomb attack on CM last year. Now, I'll take the case in my hand and I'll also disappear. I will investigate about Hussain. I will know what the truth is. - Officer, what are you saying? Did Al Salim place the bomb in the CM meeting? Al Salim killed the former CM to replace him with his man. Oh, really? - Yes, this is the truth. It must be true, but how will you prove it? Do you have any evidence with you? What kind of a question is this, sir? The job of a policeman is to find the evidence. We are paid salary for that. Listening to him looks like he's working in.. ..Municipal department and not in police. They dirty the city and don't even clean it. Evidence! Our job is to find evidence! Shut up! You said Al Salim placed the bomb. Did he go there? Paper! Newspaper! - Ganpat! Hello sir, newspaper. Good morning, sir. Do you remember the bomb blast that occurred last year? Sir, bomb blasts occur every day. Which bomb blast are you talking about? - Ganpat! The bomb blast that occurred in CM's public meeting. That one? It is none other than Al Salim! It was his job. Al Salim? - Don't you know? CM was not ready to give in, so they killed him in bomb blast. Al Salim? Are you sure he killed him? Sir, Al Salim placed the bomb. Is it? How can Al Salim place the bomb.. ..did he go there himself? Sir, what's wrong with you? Tell me. Who built Taj Mahal? - Shah Jahan. Did Shah Jahan build it himself? No, sir. He got it built by his men. Shah Jahan paid money to get the job done by his men. The same way, Al Salim gave the money.. ..and his men placed the bomb. Bomb blast and CM died. Case solved. It is a very simple case. What are you talking? You are a superior policeman. I am a kid who sells newspaper.. ..but I solved the case, and you couldn't. Paper! Newspaper! Ranjit Prasad.. ..inspector general of police. Lilly. - Sir? Get me all the details of last year's bomb blast. I need full details. Sir, the incident took place on 30th October. Inspector Hussain was handed over this case on 1st November. The explosives used in the blast.. ..was from Subramaniam Chemicals. The press meeting that was held on 3rd November, 2013.. ..he said he found evidence against Al Salim. But he is missing since the next day. Where are the evidence that Hussain had collected? Sir, they got burnt in the accident. Did it get burnt or were burnt? Wait a minute.. rewind. Zoom it. Who's factory is that? - Al Salim's man, Subramaniam.. We've loaded the stuff in the truck. He's coming, we'll talk later Why did you call me? - Actually.. Sir, I know why you are laughing. I read it in the paper this morning. Sir, I've cut the paper and stuck to my wall so that I remember this news. I called you to show this to you. CM scolded me on phone. I had warned you, didn't I? Sir, I had to raid the truck so I went there. Somebody amongst us has leaked the information. They escaped by giving a cage into my hands. They even hid the RDX. - Okay, it must be true. I agree with you. But what about others? They would need evidence. Evidence! You'll be a pride to the police department.. ..by catching rats on the streets? People will stop trusting us only because of you. Sir, stop laughing unnecessarily. Sir, the public who hates the police and its department.. ..I taught them to respect us. I awakened their hopes. Still you are laughing on me? That old woman had lodged a complaint about her son missing, a year ago. Nothing happened. She trusted the police department because of me. I awakened her trust! I will get her justice, note that point. Evidence? You want evidence? You'll surely get that one day. The day I find it, I will expose all the people behind this crime. Then we'll see who laughs? IG Ranjit Prasad, sir! Until I don't justice to that woman.. ..I will not let any criminal sleep peacefully. Hello? Finish the work. Hey, stop the car. Move the car from 'No Parking' zone. No, no. Sir. Is this your car? Move it! - Sir, it is Mr. Salim's car. Who? - Al Salim. Al Salim? - Yes. You wanted evidence, didn't you? There are many witnesses here. Dilip! - Sir? - Call the photographer! Yes, sir. Move. Let's go. Where is my car! Hurry up or we'll reach the garage. Sir, please, come. Where is my car? Sir, I bought this new car. S Class, brand new. Sir, please come. - Where is my car? Sir, it was parked in 'No Parking' zone.. ..so the police took it. - Who? Sir, the same.. ..who had come to your office. "The lightening has.." What has it done? "It gestured." "This game is for a moment." - Sir. "It will become a charade.." - Sir, what happened? Let's go.. Sir, what's the matter? Sir, my car is ready. Please, sit in my car. Sir, are you angry? We'll talk to the traffic police. Mr. Salim? Al Salim? Let's go, sir. What is going on here? Everyone is watching. Sir, listen to me. Forgive me. "It will become a charade.." Bye, mom! Is IG Ranjit here? No. - He has called me here. I told IG and he sent you here. They dance to my tunes. Stop! Stop it! Stop it! Listen, if I pull the trigger of this hi-tech gun, a bullet of 324 mm.. ..will come out with full speed that will blow your brains. Within 0.1 sec, your brain will be fallen on the concrete floor.. ..of the tallest building in this world. You fool. Then you and your kingdom will be over. It is very easy to kill you. Al Salim, killing you is as simple as snapping your fingers. Remember, I aim to kill the beast in a human and not himself. Killing people like you is futile. I have to uproot the poisonous tree of sins growing inside you. Not only you're involved in hollowing this country.. ..the people who take back their cases fearing you.. ..ACP is also a traitor. The one who takes money from you and considers you as God.. ..every government official is a traitor. Don't know how many innocent people you have killed since 25 years.. ..don't know you looted how many people's hard earned money.. ..but Al Salim is living lavishly today. I, office Karamveer Pratap, after 25 years.. ..came on silver jubilee to teach you a lesson. People who consider Al Salim and you as God.. ..and make mistakes by making honest police inspector like me as puppet.. ..they'll fear from me. My mother gave birth to me.. ..to free this society from people like you. The people who couldn't understand Ramayan and Bagwat Gita.. ..even after reading it many times, will learn after you are killed. I will not spare him! I want my car on my door. He will get it here. How? - Excuse me, sir. I've brought coffee for you. A human gets scared when the lion roars.. ..but I got scared from a rat's squeak. Why did this happen? - I don't know. I'm lying like a dead body here. - Yes. Which mother gave him birth? Who is he? Where did he come from without being invited? IG.. There are two types of tigers. One that is born and brought up in a cage.. ..and the other that is brought up in a jungle. Do you know how to differentiate them? By looking into their eyes. I'd seen his eyes. IG, he was not born in a cage like you. He is a tiger of the jungle. He is a wild tiger. I want my car back. I want him to get it. Like a driver. - It is not possible. Then he must die! Die! Die! Die! D I E! Die? - Yes. How? How? Sir, if you were strict, this wouldn't have happened. Had you given me a chance, I would've killed him. You're repeating that you want car. How is it possible? Go.. Go and kill him. Go. Sir, I was joking. You can't kill him? - No ways. What should you do then? Other than that? Go. I want my car. Al Salim, forget that. If you love your car so much, I will get it for you. - No, IG. It is not just about my car. It is about my reputation. I want it back. Oh.. - How? How? Bury him in the ground. How? How? How? How? How? How? How? How? How? How? How? How? I want my car. We've got all the details of Al Salim's S class Benz car.. ..that was towed from 'No Parking' zone. From details we come to know that.. ..the car was not bought by Al Salim.. ..from New York, Manhattan Benz showroom. It has been delivered to somebody named Nixon. Al Salim bought this car from him. Nixon? - Yes, sir. He had planned to kill our Prime Minister in Thailand. International terrorist Nixon and he are the same. Three months before Nixon got killed in the Interpol attack.. ..this car was transferred to Al Salim. Al Salim bought this car from notorious terrorist, Nixon. Yes, sir. That day he was shouting so much to give evidence. His car that we towed.. ..will become the biggest evidence. Al Salim and Nixon were in touch, this is right. Now we just have to confirm it. Dilip. - Yes, sir? Move! Hi. A beautiful girl kissed me. But I didn't feel anything happening in my body. He has tortured me so much. I want my car. I want my car. - Don't worry, sir. I will talk to the ACP. Hello ACP, do you wish to die? He can't wait for the car anymore. Did you understand or do you want me to come? ACP.. - I want my car. I want my car. - Al Salim! Everything got ruined. I want my car. - To hell with your car. Our life is at risk. He wouldn't have done all this if you hadn't provoked him. "I want my car". Do you know where that car took him? To its real owner. Nixon! Nixon's name has come out in it. Do you know the consequences of this? He will not spare you. Hey, get up. Take a round. - You are right. It is S class car. - Listen to me. Sir, I'm finding the car. ACP, don't worry about the money. Just send the car. Hey, I don't want the car. - You don't want it? I don't want it. - ACP, listen, don't worry about the car. We don't want the car. God bless you. I was to get a promotion. Get lost! Sir, sir. Sir, the officer is here with the car. Car keys. - I don't want it. Sir, this is your car keys. Take them. I don't want this car. - Listen, Al Salim. You said, until I don't park this car here myself.. ..you'll not take the car. So, I got scared and brought the car to you. Take the keys. Al Salim, sometimes you say you want the car.. ..and then you say you don't want it. I don't understand you. You have egg, you'll understand. Okay, Al Salim. You are confused whether you want the car or not. But I am not interested in knowing it. I've learnt some interesting things. Why did you pay 1.5 crore rupees.. ..to get this car from New York to India. I don't think it is important to tell this to you. Mr. Al Salim, had you bought this car from a common man.. ..it wouldn't have been necessary. But you bought this car from notorious terrorist Nixon. You had parked this car in the 'No Parking' zone. You bought this car from Nixon, I have evidence for it. You always said.. ..E V I D E N C E, evidence.. I have evidence with me today. Why did you buy this car from Nixon? Come on, answer me. I like to buy the very first model of every Benz car. Nixon had its first model, so I bought it from him. Other than that, I don't know anything about Nixon. You are lying, Al Salim. - It is true. You are lying, Al Salim. How can you say whether it is lie or true? Had you told the truth, you wouldn't have seen upwards, but sideward. What did you say? - If someone had to tell the truth.. ..he would've seen at the side to say what happened that day. The one who cooks up stories.. ..looks upwards, like you did. You say, you are not connected to Nixon. No. Al Salim, you are talking to Karamveer Pratap. Think before you say. You can't do anything without evidence. Your stupid theories won't work. Bring back Nixon to life and prove this to me. Okay. IG sir, even you are in the queue. Good day, sir. Sir, it is good he left. Yes, but he went very proudly. Not by believing me. He went with the faith that.. ..he will surely arrest me. Before he nabs Nixon.. ..we have to do something. Like.. Yes, tell me. What? Where? How did it happen? - Mother-in-law and I had gone for shopping.. ..Al Salim's gang came there and this.. No wait, don't go. Don't leave me and go, please. I'm dying. I had many dreams.. ..that we'll have two children. We'll name one as Singham and the other one as Dabang. But all the dreams shattered. Do you know, I had your personality in mind? You are bleeding so much. Darling, it is up to God to give or take life. How can the people on earth stop the blood? Darling, I have only one wish. I don't know whether you'll fulfill it or not. A pinch of vermillion.. we don't have it at home. But I've arranged for a nuptial chain. Please, put it in my neck. Please, don't think much. Or it will be too late. Do you love me? Please, fulfill the last wish of a dying person. Please. I know, I know.. ..what you are thinking. All the arrangements have been done. Mother-in-law.. Don't delay, he has to leave for duty. - Yes, son. Yes. Thanks. Thanks. Thanks. Listen, I have one more last wish. Tell me. We're married now. I'm a married woman now. Give me a farewell kiss. Please. This was not in the script. - Please. Oh, you are shying as so many people are here? Looks like she'll finish her honeymoon today. They'll go away. - The love scene is about to begin. Go.. and let us do our work. Let's go. Come, come.. - But they.. - Come. Come. Come, come. Closer, yes. Oh God, who did I marry? Who told you to kiss here? A mother or a sister is kissed like this. Not a wife. Take two. Come. Come. Come. Come, my darling. Baby! Drama was successful. Remove the prop. It is very expensive. Brother-in-law, won't you enjoy your wedding feast? Go, it is ready. Go. Let's go. - Let's go, dear. Please, come. Had you acted for some more time, the blood stock.. - Careful.. ..was about to get over. - Hey! What is it? - Why did you do this drama? It was not drama, but reality show. We performed, what would take more 10-20 years later. We got you both married. Go and get food for brother-in-law, go. Okay. - Food? She will give me food.. ..but I will shoot you. - Stop. - Leave me. What are you doing? Mom, you were supporting them? You got me married with deceit. If you achieve something in life, I will get the credit, isn't it? Even I wanted a company, so I played this charade. Forget it. Listen, shall I feed you? Have it, get used to it. - Shut up! Your son, mom. He had sent professionals to kill me. They didn't try to kill me when I took Hussain's case. When I handled the CM's murder case.. ..they didn't kill me. When I towed his car from 'No Parking' zone.. ..he didn't do anything to me. But when I questioned him about Nixon.. ..he sent his men to kill me. There's something fishy. When asked about deceased Nixon.. ..why did Al Salim get so agitated to kill me? One thing is true.. ..we are very near to Nixon's secret. Very near. Dilip. - Yes, sir? People! - Sir! Take out all the details about Nixon and Al Salim's nexus. - Yes, sir! This is Nixon Casanova. Den of all the international terrorists. Nixon supplied all the information.. ..money and arms to all the terrorists. Only Nixon used to decide.. ..which country or whom they have to attack. Stop. Come back.. come back. Come back. Zoom in. Who is she? "You're the one who make the bad guys cry." "You're the one who make the bad guys cry." "You're the one who make the bad guys cry." "That checked out while you cry." Yes, I was in love with Nixon. Only after he got killed in an Interpol attack,.. ..I learnt that he was a terrorist. I just entertain people now. Anything else? Did you know any of Nixon's friends? Sir, you won't know anything about Nixon from me. The much you know about him.. ..I know even less than that. So, please don't trouble me. Whenever you are called for an enquiry.. ..you will cooperate with us. Okay? Sure. - Thank you. Was he there? - Yes, boss. What did you say? - As you had instructed me. Jennie! - One minute, sir. Open Nixon's file. Interpol folder.. ..scroll down slowly. Scroll down. Stop. Keep doing. Jennie! - Sir? Which country's immigration stamp is on Nixon's passport from two years? I'll check. Sir! - Yes? Sir, we found the details. October 25th.. Nixon had come to Hyderabad. October 30th.. CM bomb blast. Nixon left for New York on 4th November. November 5th, Hussain's mother lodged a complaint of her missing son. Nixon went to Thailand on 10th Jan. Jan 18th, our Prime Minister was attacked in Thailand. Jan 25th, Nixon came back to India. There are no evidence that says he left India. But then we get news from New York Interpol.. ..that Nixon got killed in New York. When Nixon was not there, how did he die? One thing is for sure.. Somebody has come to India with Nixon's duplicate passport. Who is the Nixon who has come to India? Preeti. - Sir? Nixon had come to Hyderabad airport on 25th October. Check the surveillance footage. - Yes, sir. Please send all data immediately. All details of main screen, sir. Stop. Who is he? Zoom in. Sir, he is CEO Narendra. Whoever came was a Christian. CEO Narendra is a Hindu. He is very clever. Go forward. Stop, zoom in! Who is he? Sir, he is a DJ.. Naag. Okay, check and tell me.. ..who is he talking on phone? Sir, it is 9840211000. Whose number is it? Subramaniam. Sir, he is Al Salim's man. If we have to find the one with the duplicate passport.. ..then we have to find these three. Dilip! - Sir! Hello, sir. What happened? How? Baby, I'm so sorry. - What new excuse? I am not making excuses. How? How? After his two aids died.. ..I think the third one is hiding fearing Al Salim. Take out any speech of Subramaniam from our database. Many people died in the bomb blast at Millennium park. Many people don't like Al Salim. So, they want to trap Al Salim.. ..behind the conspiracy. Many times I told them.. ..that I don't have anything to do with Al Salim other than my business. Even after telling for so many times, some people are after me. If this happens again.. ..I will take action against them. - Freeze it. 'Many times'.. ..he is using it many times. Search this on the satellite. 'Many times'. Sir, this word is coming from 10 numbers. Which voice frequency does it match? 'Many times'. - 'Many times'. 'Many times'. - 'Many times'. 'Many times'. - 'Many times'. 'Many times'. - 'Many times'. 'Many times'. - 'Many times'. Trace his address. Sir, No. 2, first floor, Sayed Ali, Kabootar street.. ..Shali Banda, Old city. Down, down! Shall I tell you separately? Throw your guns! Sir! Stop! Hurry up! Drive faster! Block the road! Stop! Stop! Take a U-turn. Run! - Move! Move from there. What is going on? Hey, don't stop. Ram the car into him! No, sir. How do we stop that tornado? I don't understand what to do. He doesn't fear death. Then whose death will make him restless? He doesn't have siblings. Yes, he talks about mother some times. We can get his mother's details. Come on. Leave me! Leave me! Where are you taking me? Leave me! Where have you brought me? Leave me. So, you got saved that day? Yes. What did you say? "Your husband was an ordinary police officer." He couldn't harm me.. ..then you are a woman. What can you do?" You were right. I am a woman. What can I do? I can just give birth to a child. I did the same. Karamveer is my son. Salim, small words sound sweet to you, right? Like, "Where are you?" Do you know which is my favorite word? "How? How? How?" You will keep asking. How to bribe Karamveer? How to abduct Karamveer? How can you scare him? How can you get him killed? You'll go insane thinking how. But you can't harm my son. By kidnapping me.. ..you want to scare my son? You are a fool! Do you want to hear the truth? I still haven't told about.. ..your cruelty towards me, to my son. He has brought you to this condition because of Hussain.. ..and he has made your life miserable. Just think, when he learns.. ..that you killed his father.. ..then what he will do to you. Have you brought me here to kill me? Then kill me. Why don't you kill me? Karamveer will kill you easily. If not here, I will see you dying.. ..from the sky. Is that all? You decide whether you have to die instantly.. ..or suffer to death? Now tell me. If you want to kill me now, then go ahead. If you want me to go home, I'll go. Speak up. Do you want me to stay or leave? Son, will you give me way? Thanks. - Why thank me? You saved my life that night in the jungle. You dropped me home today. Whatever happened, please don't tell my son. I am feeling proud.. ..that my son has done his duty with honesty. He didn't take his mother's revenge. Sister.. - Yes? Where's Nixon? Tell me! Sir, Nixon's girlfriend has called. Dilip! - Sir! Preeti.. - Yes, sir? Sir, I had told you that I'm Nixon's girlfriend. It was a lie. I'm not Nixon's, but Hussain's girlfriend. Somebody else had come to India on Nixon's fake passport. That imposter Nixon planted the bomb. The same Nixon got Hussain killed. Do you know that imposter Nixon? No, sir. But to know that, I've joined Al Salim's gang. He has learnt my truth. He can get me killed any time. I have all the evidence about imposter Nixon's whereabouts. I will wait here, you come. Hello? - ACP, he's not in the office. You go and kill Subramaniam. I will handle the rest. I can't murder anyone. Hand over this job to IG. I'm sorry. - ACP, you have time till 4 o'clock. Or.. your time will be over. - But.. Hello? - Sir, I'm Ravi speaking. Where's your phone? - If I don't kill Subramaniam till 4.. ..then Al Salim will kill me. - What? I've learnt to do the duty from you. - What's the matter? I can't cheat now. - What? If I don't do his job, Salim will surely kill me. But before that, I want to give you evidence about Nixon. Sir, come to the jungle that is outside the city. Listen to me.. Auto! Dilip. - Sir? ACP wants to tell something about Nixon. Protect him until I reach. - Yes, sir. Move back. Back, come on. Stop! Sir, we checked. We didn't find anything. ACP, are you surprised? Who are you waiting for? Do you want to give any information? Tell me. What did you want to tell him? That I am Nixon? ACP, don't you love your life? Fear death. Not at all. I've forgotten to fear seeing Karamveer's patriotism. I've forgotten to fear after remembering the oath of honesty. A woman is living like a policeman. I'm living like a eunuch wearing police uniform. I should have told Pratap earlier that.. ..you are terrorist Nixon. I was living like a coward. This was my biggest mistake. Police.. I betrayed such a pious word. Everyone has to die one day. But some are considered as martyrs. Instead of dying daily, it is better that I become a martyr. ACP! ACP? He went that way! After killing them, he went that way. He came suddenly, shot and fled from there. ACP.. - Let's go. ACP.. ACP.. ACP, what happened? Tell me. Tell me, sir. Who was he? Who was he, sir? Answer me. Jafar.. Sir, answer me. Sir.. Do you know him? Sir, answer me. Sir.. Tell me, sir. Do you recognize him? Sir? Dilip! Preeti.. - Sir? - Open the pen drive. Sir, I need a password. Hack the password and open the program. - I'm trying, sir. Still not opening, sir. - Keep trying. No, sir. - Do something! Still not getting, sir. Preeti, this is urgent and important. Do something. Yes sir, but I need some more time. - Keep working. Sir, the body is here. You have to crack it. - Yes, sir. Squad, attention! Arms in your hand! Dilip.. - Sir, I'll be back from the washroom. Go. Any progress? - No, sir. Keep trying, Preeti. - Yes, sir. Date of birth, place of birth, place of issue, date of issue. - Yes, sir. Listen. - Yes, sir? Call Dilip. - Yes, sir. Sir, Subramaniam is dead. Sir, password is unlocked. Password unlocked? - Yes, sir. I'm unlocking it. - Good. Sir, Dilip is not here. I looked for him everywhere. - Sir. Dilip! - Sir? We're very close to the matter that is related to Nixon. - Yes, sir. Someone has come to India with Nixon's duplicate passport. Hey, tell me! Hello, mom? - Mom is getting ready, sir. You don't worry. I'll get her, sir. Dear, are you ready? - Yes. - Keep the pen drive safely. Do you want to talk to mom? You don't want to talk? Okay, sir. Do you know where to come? - Let's go. - Yes. - I'll get them. You get the pen drive. - Yes. Did he come? - Yes, sir. Hey! Come, come. Come. Come. You showed me hell. Hey, when you pointed gun on my forehead.. ..I got scared. But when I pointed gun at you.. Where do you get so much guts from? I'll feel relaxed seeing fear in your eyes. When I will see fear in your eyes.. ..I will feel at peace. I will fulfill my revenge. Hey, your mother thinks she did a favor on me. She didn't tell you many things. Hey, hey! What did you hide? I will tell him what you've hidden from him. I'll tell him! Al Salim will tell you! Your mother hid a secret from you. I will tell you. 25 years ago, a policeman.. ..tried to stop me. What happened to that policeman? I killed him. Do you know who he was? Guess. Tell me. Tell me. He was your.. father. I told you everything. I told the truth to you. Hey! If my son knows.. Now.. I have told him. But what can he do? What will he do to me? Hey, what will you do to me? What? No! Hey, what did you say? You are a power star? You are a power star, aren't you? Enjoy this power now. Here. Here.. Power star? Now, power star! Hey, don't snap your fingers. If someone snap their fingers.. ..I get very angry. Who am I.. you don't know. I killed CM by planting a bomb at Millennium park. I killed Hussain who came to arrest me in that case. Who do you think you are? I will rip your skin off. I will rip your skin off. If I kill Prime Minister Samar Singh.. ..I will get billions of money. Truck full of money. I will flourish my violence world. I will get more power. Power! I killed the Prime Minister in Thailand. By making a plan of imposter Nixon. But you intervened. Then you made your tiger team. You made your tiger team after CM's death. With that help.. ..I planned to kill PM on 15th August. I made this man as Nixon and made him join your team. Do you know made fake passport for Nixon? IG. IG. You were looking for this Nixon, right? You looked for him everywhere. New York and in Australia. You even looked in India, but you didn't look around you. You didn't look in your team. I made that plan. Hey, even God can't nab the thieves at the temple. I told you everything. What will you do to me? Ask him, what will he do to me? Will you harm me? He can't harm me in any ways. Hey, can you harm me? Tell me. Try to harm me if you have guts. This camera has done its job. Look at it carefully. BBC, CNN.. ..whatever you said, live telecast is on.. ..on 134 channels. Keep this. You are trying to act smart with me? Fool, did you now know, why I got thrashed by you? All the powers are failing in front of this power star. Al Salim! When I snapped my fingers and challenged you in the office.. ..I understood, you won't go crazy. There's power in my snap too. How much you were shouting to get evidence. Did you see? I gave you so much evidence now. No! You are caught! You can't stay here for a minute here. Hide in any corner of the country. Al Salim, from a constable of three town police station.. ..to American CIA, they all will kill you so brutally.. ..that your soul will shiver! You won't be able to be born again. Al Salim! What did you say? You want to see fear in my eyes? - No, I don't want to see. You said, you want to see fear in my eyes. - No, I don't. You won't see fear in my eyes. - No! You can see only pride! We feel proud seeing the tricolor of our country.. ..you'll see the same pride in a patriot's eyes. - No! Do you know what I am proud about? I'm proud that I'm born on this land. I feel proud about the martyrs who died for their country. I feel proud about the soldiers who are protecting the border. I am ready to fight for my country alone. I am ready to sacrifice for my country. If any enemy dares to see my country.. ..I will hack him to pieces. - No! To save patriots like Hussain.. ..I can bury traitors like you.. ..outside the border. Whenever scoundrels like you spread terror in this country.. ..people like me will kill them! Son! Son? Kill him! Don't kill me. Tell him to spare me. Tell him to spare me. Tell him, please. No! It is hurting. Corruption has been put to an end. IG Ranjit Prasad has been sentenced life time imprisonment. ACP Ravi Kumar's daughter has joined the police academy. Hope that she makes her father proud. Late inspector Hussain.. ..has been facilitated for his bravery by the government. Prime Minister honored his mother. - You see. What is it? - It is time to play cards. I will not come. - Why? Look, I've learnt a lot while selling papers. Even I want to do something in life. I want to make my country proud. How happy my father will be. Do you know? Not only for our state.. ..in every alley of India.. ..I will sell my own newspaper.. ..and will progress my business. One day I have to become the boss of Newspaper company. Friends, you also go and do something.. ..for your country. - The society is changing. On the other hand, Karamveer Pratap beget a boy. What happened to your grandson? Why is he crying so much? He says, he wants a sister. Am I right? - Oh. Look, what is this? To give a new direction to the society.. ..Karamveer Pratap is doing his duty with honesty.
