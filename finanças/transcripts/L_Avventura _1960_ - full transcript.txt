Soon this poor villa will he smothered. To think there were woods here once. - That'll all be houses. - Yes, there's nowhere to run. That's right. Here you are. I was looking for you upstairs. - I thought you were already way out at sea. - Not yet, Father. Isn't it customary to wear a sailors cap with the yacht's name on it? - How long will you be away? - Four or five days. Well, I suppose I'll spend the weekend alone. I'll rest. I should have grown used to it by now. - Used to what, Father? To rest, not only from my diplomatic duties but as a father. - Why do you say such things? - It's the truth. Allow me at least this much: After thirty years of never telling the truth, I might as well speak truthfully to my own daughter now. Any more truths to tell me? You know it. That one I would beg you to spare me. That man will never marry you, my darling daughter. So far, I've been the one who doesn't want to marry him. It's the same difference. Have you been waiting long? I'm sorry. Alvaro, hurry up. It's late. I'll wait for you here, all right? Where are you going? - To the café. I'm thirsty. While a man you haven't seen for a month has been waiting half an hour for you? I'd happily give up seeing him today. But we rushed all the way- Very well. Good-bye, cruise. It's torture being apart. Really. Ifs difficult keeping a relationship going with one person here and the other there. But it's convenient. Because you can imagine whatever you like. Do you see? Whereas when somebody's right in front of you, that's all you get. Know what I mean? Let's go back. Come on. I'll be right down. Should I give you my profile? Well? What's wrong with me? Your friend is downstairs, waiting. Let her wait. How are you? Awful. Why? This one has to starve for a while yet. Go away, you filthy animal. It's as smooth as oil. I don't know why, but I hate all comparisons involving oil. Look. Did you sleep well? Last night, I went to bed intending to think about lots of things... and then I fell asleep. I didn't know you could sleep so well on these things. They rock you. I slept very badly. You should sunbathe. Shall we swim? Not here. It's frightening. Once the Aeolian islands were all volcanoes. When we came here together twelve years ago, you said the exact same thing. What's the name of this one? This must be Basiluzzo. Basiluzzo. It sounds like the name of a fish. That one is Lisca Bianca. How boring. All this fuss over a swim. Careful. Mario, woman overboard! I'm right here, Patrizia. Why have we stopped? Aren't you going to swim? You know, I had a dream I was swimming. You go ahead. - Do you like spear-fishing? - I hate it, but I must adapt. What can you do? Whoever said that man originally inhabited the sea? Patrizia, if you give me your yacht's flag, I'll go plant it on the island. I never understood islands. Surrounded by nothing but water, poor things. - Mario, prepare the dinghy. Sandro, where are you going? Ask her. It's harder working on leisure boats. - Why? - The owners have no set schedule. For instance, last night, we travelled all night long. I didn't get any sleep. Shark! Stay right where you are. Don't anyone move. Go away. Come. Hold on. - What's happening? - There's a shark around here. Don't move. Who's going anywhere? How did you know it was there? Did it touch you? I would have died. With its horrible face and all those teeth. Have some cognac, Anna. It's nothing. It's all over now. I'd just like to change. I'm cold. Summer is really over. I wonder where the shark went. Well, what is it? Which one should I wear'? This one, or this? This one. It's divine. Why don't you try it on? It looks better on you. Keep it. You know, the whole shark thing was a lie. - Why? - Because. But don't think about it now. It's over. I don't want to know why you do these things. It's Sandro, I suppose. Did you get what you wanted, at least? Come on, let's go. Aren't you going ashore? You call those rocks a shore? Were you still in the water'? Don't you know there's a shark around here? A shark? So I might have been killed? ls that what you're telling me? That's just great. What do you want, Raimondo? You want me? At this time of day? There's no spark. Is this better? Are you happy? You're a little disappointed. Tell the truth. Not at all. Quite the opposite. What kind of face do you think Raimondo has? A rather corrupt one, I'd say. What? He's a child. Don't start, Patrizia. I'd rather be corrupt. Unless you happen to love children. - I don't love anyone. You know it. I know, I know, damn it. To think that if there ever was a woman deliberately created, actually custom-made for every kind of promiscuity and betrayal, of sordidness and debauchery, it would be her. She's faithful, a faithfulness born of apathy. It amuses me. It's the only amusement I know, besides my dog. Should we go ashore? There should be some ancient ruins up there. Should we go see them? Giulia, do you remember? No, it's better if you take a nap. You say, “How beautiful," about everything: the sea, a child, a cat. Your sensitive little heart races at nothing. If something is beautiful, why shouldn't I say so? What a nice creature. - What are you talking about? - The shark. Still? How wonderful. Corrado, would you like one? This is Patrizia's way of sharing our company. You know, I find you very nice. - More than the shark? - There's no comparison. Then come take a look at those ruins with me. That's an idea. But no, we'd better stay here. A month is too long. I got used to being without you. It's the usual awkwardness. It will go away. - It's a little more this time. - It'll take a little longer to go away, then. Well, I think we should talk about it. Or do you think we won't be able to understand each other either? We'll have time to talk. We're getting married. What's longer time than a lifetime? In this case, getting married would mean nothing. Aren't we already acting like we're married? Aren't Giulia and Corrado already acting like they're married? Why are we arguing, talking? Believe me, Anna, words are more and more pointless. They create misunderstandings. I care for you, Anna. Isn't that enough? No, it isn't enough. I'd like to spend some time alone. - But you just said that one month - - More time. Two months, a year, three years. I know, it's absurd. I'm distraught. The idea of losing you makes me want to die. And yet... I don't feel you anymore. Even yesterday, at my place, you didn't feel me anymore? You always have to dirty everything. The weathers changing. Please, Giulia. There's no need to be so didactic all the time. I can see for myself that the weather is changing. We should leave now. - Why? - The sea is getting rough. - And Anna? - I don't know. I thought I heard a boat. - Yes. - You hear it? Where's Anna? She was here. - Isn't she on-board? - I don't know, miss. Is Anna there? No, she's not here. This is typical Anna. It drives me mad. This island is so beautiful. Isn't it? Did you find her? Sandro, nothing? Did you see? Did you see the way he treats me? - Who? He's done nothing but put me down today. We haven't found a thing. Not even a trace. Let's be practical. You all go to the nearest island. There must be a police station, or the coast guard, or who the hell knows what. Report her missing. I'll stay here. I'll stay because - I don't know. I have a feeling something could happen. Anyway, I don't feel like leaving. Well then, let's go. There's no point in wasting more time. How long will it take to get there and back? If there's a station on Panarea, a couple of hours. If we have to go to Lipari, a lot longer. It also depends on the sea. - Of course, there's the sea. I'm staying here with Sandro. Why? What if it rains? If it rains, I'll buy an umbrella. I'm not leaving. I understand you, but we two are already staying. Furthermore, your presence here - no offence - might be a hindrance. We forgot to ask them to leave us a lamp. Here's a lantern, at least. I think she's still alive. This morning, that story about the shark wasn't true. - Why did you wait till now to tell us? - I don't know. I didn't think it was worth it. She was laughing. Right, but it remains to be seen why she made up this shark. What was she trying to achieve? - Perhaps we'd better ask him. - Me? Why? Did you quarrel? I don't mean to pry, but it's very important. The usual arguments. The only thing, if I remember correctly, is that she wanted to be alone. And how do you explain that? What is this? What are you doing? Are you the owner? No, the owners are in Australia. I was in Australia too, for thirty years. My nephew. Those were the days. Where did you come from? We searched everywhere. From Panarea. From Panarea. Then it was you today around two. I saw a boat go by. It must have been four or five. - This afternoon? - No, this morning. Why? What happened? Why don't you tell him? A girl who was with us has disappeared. Disappeared how? Drowned? She didn't drown. She disappeared, and we don't know where. And it's all my fault. Go on. Say it. It's what you're thinking. You're so concerned with what I'm thinking. You should have made more of an effort to understand what Anna was thinking. Did you look behind the house? She might have fallen off the cliff. Because last month, the same thing happened to a lamb of mine. I looked for it all day, and only at nightfall I heard it bleating. It must have been - Come, Claudia. Come back inside. How are you? Feeling any better? I'm sorry for last night. - You love Anna very much. - Yes, very much. Did she ever talk to you about me? Seldom, but always tenderly. And yet- And yet she acted as though our love, mine, yours, even her fathers, in a way, weren't enough for her, meant nothing to her. Sometimes I wonder what I could have done to prevent all this from happening. - Whose boat is that? - What boat? A moment ago. Didn't you hear? There are so many boats around here during the summer. - Why did you get up so early? - ls five in the morning early? Nothing. Don't look at me like that, Marshal. There's no need for that. Push harder over there. There's a cave under there. Yes. There it is. Let's hope they don't find her. T hey would find her dead-. Listen, Patrizia, he says there's a current that heads straight from here to another island. I don't know which, but this is another clue. The marshal says he'd like to send one of his men to look. You never know. Would you mind if- Would you mind if I ask Raimondo to go with him? Why would I mind? I think you should be the one to go. Yes, perhaps that would be better. What fascinates me is Sandro. He seems almost tranquil. - Tranquil? I don't think so. He was awake all night. - What's that? - An ancient vase. There's a city buried under here. It's full of this stuff. And of course here he comes. - Let me see it. - Go on. What century is it from? Why don't we ask if we can have it? Right, so you can plant geraniums in it. - Weren't you supposed to leave? - No, it's useless. What a shame. It figures. Here's Anna's father. I looked through Anna's suitcase, and - Yes, it's Anna's. She gave it to me yesterday. I found it in my bag. I didn't want to, but I had nothing else to wear this morning. I'm sorry. I found these in her suitcase. This is a good sign. Don't you think? I think someone who reads the Bible wouldn't do anything rash, because it means they believe in God. So I would definitively rule out the suicide hypothesis, right? It's the police. Come here. They have important news. What news? They stopped a suspicious boat a few miles from here. The crew is being questioned in Milazzo. - We should go and see. - Did you hear that? - We're in the hands of God. I agree, but for now I think we should definitely go to Milazzo. Forgive my frankness, but try to understand that I'm the person closest to your daughter. Be that as it may, right now my daughter needs her father more than you. - What are you going to do? - What can we do? I don't even know. We'll go visit the Montaldos. I'll get my bag- I'm sorry. It's fine. - I'll join you at the Montaldos then. I think this is the best solution. Ettore should be there already. - I'm going to visit all the islands. - What? I can't leave until I've seen those islands, every single one. But aren't you tired? It's a miracle I'm even standing. I'm here, Patrizia. I'm always here. Claudia isn't coming with us. Will you take care of her bag? I hear you're having family troubles. Is that so? Yes, my sister has been ill for a year, and my father too. So that's why you're a smuggler. You need the money. I can help you. I can get you state benefits, if you want them. But first, let's take care of a few formalities. A few questions and then well all go to lunch. Your partner told me you cast the net three times. Yes, three times. Bring the others in. We're nearly there. They're starting to contradict one another. Your partner told me you couldn't fish because the sea was rough. Is that right? And the other boat? - What boat? Look, my men saw it, and they saw you throwing crates overboard. What's the story? I wasn't feeling well. I'm confused. I don't know anything. What is he saying? What are you saying? - What does Anna have to do with all this? Stay here, at least. I'm willing to forget everything, the cigarettes, the smuggling, everything, as long as you tell me if you took the girl somewhere. What did you say? This is the man who built the villa here. He never would have imagined it would end up like this. Do you know the F.Z. who wrote this article in the paper? - Francesco Zuria is the journalist. - Where can I find him? If I were to offer a reward in exchange for any information - Zuria is in Messina. You can try. Would you like me to call him? - Lieutenant, sir. May I return to Lipari? Where did you put the cigarette crate? - The storeroom. When did you get here? - Two hours ago. Where's the young lady who was with you? I don't know. She said she had to catch a train. WEALTHY GIRL FROM ROME VANISHED ON LISCA BIANCA Where are you going? To the Montaldos? I'll go with you. Did you read this? They're asking anyone who might know something to get in touch. I had thought of going and talking to them. You should go. When will we see each other, then? I know it's difficult. But if you carry on this way, it becomes even more so. Please don't look so serious. And don't wait for the train. I beg you, leave. I'd really like to know what we're going to say now. Go on, speak. I don't want you with me, or to see you. How can I make you understand? Why did you come? - I couldn't help it. Well, we'll have to help it, so you might as well make this sacrifice right now. Sacrifice? I have no interest in sacrificing myself. It's idiocy sacrificing oneself. Why? For whom? I would understand your misgivings if Anna were here. But she's not. I don't mean to sound cynical. But isn't it better to face up to things as they are? To me they're exactly the same as when we first met three days ago. Just three days ago. Can you imagine? And you and Anna - No, they're not the same. How can it take so little time to change, to forget? It takes even less time. But it's sad. It's terribly sad. I'm not used to it. I'm not prepared for it. Listen, I've never felt so shaken up in my whole life. Sandro, why don't you help me? I think the only way we can help each other is by staying together. No. I'm sure that's not it. Stay there. Stay there and get off at the next stop. - And you? Leave me alone! I don't mean to intrude, but since this is a Genoa-Palermo train, are you also travelling to Palermo? - To Tindari, then? - Sant'Agata di Miniatello? It must be Cefall], then. - How did you know? - Through an acquaintance. I work as a maid in Cefalú, but I'm not from there. This acquaintance of mine knows you and has told me lots about you. Really? Who is it? Do they work in Cefalú? Yes, she's a gardener. She can't possibly know me, then. At the villa where I live, the gardener is a man. He must have told her about you. - What did they tell you about me? - Lots of things. They told me you're a good girl, that you mind your own business, that sort of thing. - We have a radio just like this one. - No, not like this one. - Why not like this one? - Because this one was made in China. These small radios are sure handy. They're especially useful - I don't know - when you're going for a walk. Which comes first for you, music or love? Music, of course. You've got to look for a fiancée, but you can buy a radio. No. Love for me. I'm a man, and I understand these things. Love first, then music. - Claudia, listen. I'm asking you, please. Promise you won't look for me. You must stop looking for me. - But why, Claudia? Why? Even if you send me away, I - Claudia. Let's not wait any longer. Later it will be too late. Come away with me. Which one of you is Zuria? - He must be inside. What do I know? I called you, Chief, because - - Which one is he? - There. ...to have a police presence here. They're breaking everything. - Pardon me, are you Mr. Zuria? - That's me, all right. - I need to ask you something. - If you can wait. I'm busy now. I was looking for a sewing shop, and I noticed all these men following me. I've never seen anything like it. So many men. Easy to believe, the way you dress. I've been all over the world dressed this way. Oh, not like this, though. My skirt came unstitched. That's why I was looking for a sewing shop. - Get back. - How old are you? Nineteen. I'm married. My name is Gloria Perkins. For the past year, I've been a writer. I write while in a trance and almost always while in communication with the dead. With Tolstoy, for instance, or Shakespeare. But I'm also interested in working in the movies. And how did they welcome you in Palermo? In Palermo, I was with my husband. Now I'm going to Capri to write an article for tourists. Exactly the same thing happened in Palermo. Miss, if you want to return to your hotel, were here to escort you. It's a disgrace. What are you doing here? Move. For a woman. How disgusting. Do you like her? Why all of this racket, then? It's all a ruse to get noticed. If someone lakes the bait, she's all right. Well, if 50 thousand weren't a month's worth of my wages, that's one whim I would have indulged, I assure you. What did you want to ask me? I read your article on that girl's disappearance. I'm her fiancé. Would you mind giving me all the details on her disappearance? If had any news, I wouldn't be here. I see you don't have any either. On the contrary. I've received several calls. One caller said she had been spotted in a car in Rome, another, at the port talking to some foreign sailors. What if she stowed away? - Does that still happen? - What do I know? Somebody said they saw her at a pharmacy in Troina. Actually, the pharmacist himself said a girl fitting the description came into his store in Troina to buy a tranquilliser. - Is that far from here? - About 50 kilometres. If you'd like, I can give you this pharmacists name. Yes. Why not? But you have to publish it in your paper tomorrow morning. You're with a Palermo newspaper, right? I mean, it has many readers. Yes, but the story is stale now. It's lost its appeal. They won't print it. You should really do this for me. Please, don't take it badly, but why should I do you a favour? Let's say it's business, then. To help you round up your salary. - I searched all the islands. - It must have been exhausting. Useless, more than anything. I can't take it anymore. Of course. How can you talk business in this heat? When you're past fifty, my darling, you only feel cold. - And what's this? - It's Claudia, Anna's friend. You haven't met my husband, have you? She's just returned from - - Incidentally, did you call him? Didn't he say he would join us here? I can't believe this is happening. Besides, I need him. How can I negotiate when all the data's missing? I think it's a good sign he hasn't been in touch. You want to bet he's found Anna? After all, forty thousand people disappear every year in Italy. That's almost enough to fill the San Siro stadium. I don't know this Sandro. What's he like? You think maybe he did her in? Good Lord, we're making a joke of something like this. We ought to be ashamed of ourselves. Coming? Princess, why don't you sell this villa? I'd turn it into a lovely clinic for nervous disorders. It's already a little like that. Goffredo is the princess's grandson. He's seventeen, lucky him. Just imagine, he paints. Anyone can hold a brush. You just buy the paint and start. Even Titian started that way. What are your paintings like? Abstract? - What do you feel when you're painting? - A shiver. Will you show them to me? I'm so curious. Hurry up. Let's go. Are you ready? I'm not. This luncheon was the last thing we needed. All these people's vitality irritates me. How does it look? - Divine. - You're just saying that to flatter me. - ls it flattery? You look like somebody else. Shall we? I'm going down. Here. He wants to show me his paintings. He never leaves my side. The poor thing must have a crush. Please, come along. Why do you want me along? Listen, you can't leave me alone with him. He's capable of- I don't know. Did you see those eyes? We're coming. Giulia, what am I coming for? Claudia, come see. A nude. They're all nudes, if I'm not mistaken. You're good. But why only women? No landscape is as lovely as a woman. - Where do you find your models? - They're a dime a dozen. I thought models were a thing of the past. Don't you, Claudia? - What? Ifs strange how women enjoy showing themselves. It almost seems like part of their nature. How can they pose that way? I couldn't. Why don't you try? Try - Me? Are you mad, Goffredo? He's mad. Not really. Don'! you ever sketch men? Answer me. Why don't you try? I'd make you a beautiful portrait. Why me? Ask Claudia. She's much more beautiful than me. I want to do your portrait. You appeal to me more. I appeal to you more? If Corrado's looking for me, you can tell him I'm here. And tell him that my little heart is racing, racing. Right now that's the only thing I care about. Clear? - Crystal. What more do I have to do to be left alone? You just have to shut the door. He wasn't at the hotel. He probably wasn't in Milazzo, either. The doorman said he asked to rent a car. I'm going to change. In any event, we'll try to find him tomorrow. He must he in Milazzo or thereabouts. - Should we go, Claudia? - I'm not coming. Why did you change, then? Send a car to pick him up. It must be 150km. Fine. We'll send for him. Giulia is like Oscar Wilde. Give her the luxuries, and she can do without the necessities. If you didn't quote somebody, you'd probably die. He does it even during our board meetings. Sorry, but I can't remember everything. Be patient. You even said she bought a tranquilliser. It's no use pretending like you don't remember. “A girl from out of town answering the description of the missing person entered my pharmacy on the afternoon of” She came in, and out she went. With him. But he won't tell you that. In case you think I didn't notice. If had an understanding with that girl, why would I call the paper? That's what I'd like to know. That makes two of us. Actually, three of us, including the gentleman. Mrs. Amalia, do you want to know why I called the paper about the person who showed up here some days ago and then disappeared? Disappeared? Who? When? That makes four. Anyone else? Please be specific. Did that girl come into your pharmacy or not? - Was she blonde or brunette? - Brunette. Blonde. - What was she wearing? - I don't remember. Some pale colour, I believe. He doesn't notice the clothing. He notices what's underneath. - Has anyone else inquired after this girl? - No, I don't think so. - Any news? - Plenty of contradictions. Yes, a few clues. Listen. The paper forgot to mention that, when the girl left, she took a bus for Noto. The bus leaves from the square. I remember very well... because I wanted to watch her walk way. Beautiful girl, really. Beautiful legs. Do you smoke? You're from Rome, aren't you? I knew it. I'm from Viterbo. He was doing his military service there, and, well - I'm not happy here. - How long have you been married? - Three months. Back inside, you. The very picture of marital bliss. Tell Lady Patrizia we're continuing our search, and that Miss Claudia will get in touch in one way or another. - What is this place called? And where will we look for Anna? In a hotel. Apparently, there's only one. The Trinacria. - Could this be Noto? - Let's ask someone. Is anybody there? Hear the echo? Why is it empty? Who knows? I wonder why they built it at all. There's another one there. It's not a town, it's a cemetery. My God, how sad. Let's go. My love. Mine. Claudia, it's late. We should go. Sandro, perhaps ifs better if you go in alone. . Are you joking? Don't think I'm trying to avoid the awkwardness, the difficulty this meeting might cause. That's not it. It's just that these things can be discussed more easily without me. Try to understand my position. It might seem as if I were there to influence you, to twist your arm, and that bothers me. Is she from up north? Is she French? What a woman. She must be French. - May I help you, miss? - I'd like a can of paint. - Which colour? - Blue. What's wrong? Sandro, I'm so ashamed, so ashamed. Did you see that? I was trying to hide. I feel miserable. I hate myself. - Do you enjoy saying these things? - No, not at all. - So why do you say them? - Because what I'm doing is ugly. Because if you told me right now, “Claudia, I love you," I'd believe you. - Claudia - - No, don't say anything. Or else I would make you swear and tell me so many things. And it's not right. It can't be right. It's absurd. - Good. All the better if it is absurd. It means we can't do anything about it, understand? I'm sorry, but we don't need it anymore. - Don't worry. - I'm sorry. - It's all right. To think that you must have told Anna these same things I don't know how many times. Let's say I did. I was in earnest with her as I am now with you. I've never met a woman like you who needs to see everything clearly. Come, let's take a walk. It's really beautiful up here. Imagine, I've never been up here. Please feel free to stay. I'm going back down. Such imagination. Such movement. They were concerned with the theatrical effect. Such extraordinary freedom. I really should go ahead and leave Ettore. I'd like to work on projects again. I used to have ideas, you know. - Why did you stop? Because it isn't easy to admit that a red floor suits a room when you think exactly the opposite. But the lady wants it red. Because there's always a lady or a man. And so - Once, I was asked to give an estimate for the construction of a school. It took me a day and a half. I earned four million lira. So I went on giving estimates... for other people's projects. Why are you looking at me like that? Because I'm convinced you could make really beautiful things. I don't know about that. I don't know. Who needs beautiful things nowadays. Claudia? How long will they last? Back then, they built for the ages. But today, how long do things last? Ten, twenty years, and then? Who knows? Claudia. Shall we get married? - What do you mean? - Let's get married, you and I. How should I answer? Not yet, anyway. I don't know. I wasn't even thinking about it. At a time like this. Why are you asking me? You're looking at me as though I'd said something mad. Are you sure you want to marry me? Really sure? That you want to many me? I'm asking you, aren't I? Why can't things be less complicated? You say I always want to see things clearly. I'd like to be clear-headed. I'd like to have truly clear ideas... and instead - They're answering. Do you hear? - From where? That bell tower over there. never leave you Forever you'll be mine mine - Are you ready? Why have I fallen so in love with you? Come on, hurry up. Where is it? Where is it? I?! always have you I won't lose you you The sweetest pining will I feel You can't leave me alone in a hotel room. Come find me when you're ready. I'll be downstairs or in the square. But first you must tell me that going out without me is like missing a leg. Go ahead and visit the city all alone. You'll limp. You must tell me you want to embrace my shadow running along the walls. And then you must tell me - You must tell me you love me. You know. Why do I have to I tell you? That's true. Why? I'll see you later. Is anyone here? A custodian? A curator? - He must be inside the church. - But there is a museum here? - What do I know? It says from 9:30 to 12:30. It's ten now. Fine way of welcoming tourists. - Tourists? What tourists? Last year, a few French tourists came. They went to the beach for a swim in their “strunk." - In their what? - Their “strunk". - In their trunks. - Yes, their “strunk.“ We let them know that they'd better move on, leave. I'm sorry. I didn't - - You did it deliberately. - Deliberately? No, why would I do that? Really. - How old are you? - Twenty-three. I was twenty-three once, and I was in so many fights you can't even imagine. Play, play- Forgive me if I'm interfering, but I've heard - Here, news get around. That girl you're looking for: Why don't you try the youth hostel in Pergusa? Almost all the girls from out of town end up slaying there. I was coming down to join you. Why back so soon? Should we go? Sandro, what's wrong? - Nothing, sorry. - Why? - No reason. What's gotten into you? I feel as though I don't know you. Aren't you happy? You're having a new fling. What are you saying? I was joking. I can never joke with you. But now tell me why you don't want to. I want all the things you want, but - But? Did the landlady tell you about the hostel near here? Yes, she started to, but I didn't feel like listening to her. If we were to listen to all the rumours - Yes, it's true, but... we haven't been in touch with anybody, not even Anna's father. We should have phoned, sent a cable. He must be feeling very lonely. Let's be fair. Right, I don't doubt that, but we are the last two people who should be near him right now. Besides, to phone him - Who knows where he is? Where is he? As you wish. Let's leave here. Go pack your bag. Concierge, who is that little doll? She just came in. I wouldn't know. I look for the others and I find you. How are you? It's disconcerting - But I can tell you that I - Fascinated - - Could we find a quieter spot? - Quieter? Yes, of course. You seem well. Here's Sandro. Why don't you both go change? - Did you get good rooms? - Not really, apparently. You should have told Ettore. He always manages to get what he wants. - Is Ettore still angry with me? - Of course not. Besides, you know he would forgive you anything, as long as you admit that he's the better driver. How do you manage with all this chaos? You've always said people irritate you. You shouldn't always take me literally. I'm really quite used to it. First my mother, then my husband, both full of energy. - Your mother? - Yes, I had a mother too. She was a bit Austrian, but I had one. My childhood was like a merry-go-round, now here, now there. Mine was a very sensible one. - What do you mean by “sensible”? - I mean without any money. - Until later, then. This way. You may leave them drawn. Would you like anything else? - Nothing. They might as well have used a robot. Put this one here, please, and the other one in there. Listen. Try not to get too tied up tomorrow. Aren't you going to change? Didn't you say you wanted to end things with Ettore? Yes, that's what I said. It's freezing. I'm not coming dawn. Why not? - I'm too sleepy. - You should learn to shake sleep off. - Have you learned? - Of course, I learned as a boy. I never slept, and I had friends who slept even less. Whoever went to bed first had to pay a fine. We didn't do anything wrong, but once the movies were over, and the café and the talk, we'd sit on a bench and listen to the drunkards, we'd watch the posters go up, or the sheep go by. Then we'd run over to the market, or we'd wake up other friends or a girl by calling her name under her windows. You're really sleepy? What time are you getting up tomorrow morning? Late. You know I wanted to be a diplomat when I was a boy? Can you imagine me as a diplomat? It's strange, but I never thought I might get rich. I saw myself in a rented room, a man of genius. Instead, I have two houses, in Rome and in Milan. As for genius... it's a habit I never picked up. What do you think? I see it differently. But it's better if we talk about it some other time. Do you mind switching off that light there? Tell me you love me. - I love you. - Tell me again. I don't love you. I deserve that. It's not true. I love you. It was designed by Balenciaga. Whore. Listen, don't be a fool. - At the bar. - Ask him to come here. - Finally! - How are you? - I'll introduce you to some friends. - I'll look around, then join you. Listen. Starting tomorrow morning, I need you on hand again, clear? If you don't give me some figures, how can I move ahead? See you. Where is Ettore? - He must be asleep in there. Would you see if Sandro is with him? He's not in his room. - Ettore. - What is it? Nothing. I was looking for Sandro. And you think he's in here? Ask Claudia. Patrizia, I'm afraid. You're telling me. I have nightmares at night. No. I'm afraid Anna has come back. I can feel that she's back, that they're together. What has gotten into you? We would have had word. Sandro must be in the garden getting some fresh air, watching the sun rise. It would be amusing to find out he's really a sentimentalist. Listen, try not to dwell on that idea, please. Go and get some sleep. A few days ago, the thought that Anna might be dead made me feel like I was dying too. Now I don't even cry. I'm afraid she might be alive. Everything is becoming so hideously easy. Even forgetting pain. One should never wish to be melodramatic. You're right. Why should I cry? I'm tired of being this way. Won't you leave me a souvenir? Just a small souvenir.
