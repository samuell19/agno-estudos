(laughing) - Hey, we're talking about Washington though. Gertrude and Heathcliff, see. They were talking, where did you go this summer? Oh I had a nice vacation, went back east. Went back east. I went to Washington D.C. And as I was flying over the capital I said, "This one's on the house." (laughing) - Ah-choo! - My poor leading man. No one's going to recognize him. - They'll recognize him. (mumbles) - Hey ladies and gentleman, last week and the camera's that we used in a sketch didn't blow up, and when we start a joke, we want it to finish. What do you think? - I think it'll work. - Don't think, see. In television we don't think, we know. - I don't think we know either. (laughing) - Now here is the man who built that thing, Sam, it didn't work last week, come in, Sam. (laughing) (applause) (upbeat music) - [Narrator] Red Skelton, A Comedy Scrapbook featuring classic Red Skelton characters, including, Freddy the Freeloader, Clem Kadiddlehopper, Sheriff Deadeye, Cauliflower McPugg, Willie Lump-Lump, George Appleby, Bolivar Shagnasty, San Fernando Red, and many more. Richard Red Skelton, no other entertainer has ever combined so many diverse facets of American humor into one comic persona. A wise-cracking top banana in burlesque, to beloved clown in folk humorous. His more than half century career has delighted generations with good natured comedy. Life of a clown with the Hagenbeck-Wallace Circus around the turn of the century was hard. It meant very low pay, and being away nine months out of the year. That's what Joe Skelton, Red's father did. He married Ida Mae in 1905. They moved to this house in Vincennes, Indiana and according to official records, Red was born on July 18, 1913. Tragically, Red's father died two months before Red was born. When Red was 12 he entertained in a traveling medicine show, two years later at age 14, Red got a job on a showboat called the Cotton Blossom, replacing an entertainer who had just been shot to death in a dispute with a riverboat gambler. During the late 1920's Red traveled the midwest performing in one show after another. In 1930 he finally landed a permanent job as the third banana in the Gayety Burlesque Theater in Kansas City. Starting salary, $75 per week. And he met his first wife, Edna, who was working as an usherette at the theater. She not only became Red's wife, but his business manager and artistic collaborator. As the early '30s rolled on, the depression deepened and a new phenomena arose called a walkathon, or dance marathon. The object was for couples to stay on the dance floor for days at a time, only taking short breaks. The last couple standing won a cash prize. People loved watching these events, but to ensure the crowd didn't get bored, comics were hired to entertain. Red landed a job at a walkathon only to find out he had to be on stage almost as much as the contestants. But it was this grueling routine that sharpened Red's comic skills. By 1938, Red had established himself as a popular vaudeville act. Film producer, Pandro Berman, spotted Red performing on Broadway and flew into Hollywood to appear in the RKO film Have a Wonderful Time, which starred Douglas Fairbanks Jr. Red was well received, but the picture was a flop. In August of '38, Skelton made his national radio debut on the top rated Fleischmann's Hour, hosted by singer, Rudy Vallee. Red was a hit, and made two more guest appearances. It also helped push his own local Chicago radio show to the top of the ratings. Later that year, Red was back before the cameras in a vitaphone short subject called Seeing Red. It featured Skelton doing some of his popular stage routines. By the early '40s, Red was a major headliner in vaudeville, and new routines like Guzzler's Gin were helping him to earn over 5,000 a week. The premise of Guzzler's Gin was that a radio announcer becomes drunk pitching a product. - No upsetting the nerves, no bad taste, it's a nice smooth drink, poor a little in your glass and drink it right down, but be sure and ask for Guzzler's Gin, a nice smooth drink. (laughing) Good. Good (mumbles). Drink a little after dinner, drink some before, you won't have to eat any dinner. - [Narrator] In 1941, Red was back in Hollywood for good and completing his second feature for MGM, The People Verses Dr. Kildare. Between his radio career and movies, Red was enjoying the good life, so much so, that he put on 40 pounds, which angered MGM mogul, Louis B. Mayer, so much that he was quoted as saying, "We hired Red Skelton "not Oliver Hardy." Red got the message and shaped up to appear in the 1941 release, Whistling in the Dark. A comedy mystery about a radio detective called the Fox, who also gets involved in real life murder. - Say, this is a nifty way to travel. Have you boys have a lot of experience? - We have. - With coffins. - Oh good, what? (moaning) I am the Fox, open that door! - You'll never take me alive! - Very well then I'll shoot the lock in. (gun shots blasting) - You have just heard another thrilling drama by the master brain of murder, the Fox who creates and solves each of these perfect crimes himself. - There's a certain gentleman who is our (mumbles). He wished to, shall we say, eliminate him. We are relying on the Fox to devise a perfect method. - You mean you want me to kill somebody on the level? - No, you just do the thinking, we'll do the work. - I had a bed brought in. - A bed, what for? You expect me to dream up this murder? Are you resting somewhere tonight? - Open that thing and tell him to let us in. - I don't think that's such a good idea. - Why not? - He's liable to do it. - Go ahead, darling, we're not afraid, are we? - Oh now don't get me wrong, it's not that I'm afraid because I am. (laughing) - [Narrator] Red's film career took off and by 1942 he starred in Ship Ahoy, Maisie gets her Man, Panama Hattie, and Whistling in Dixie. By the early '40s, Red was knocking 'em dead in his own NBC radio show. Characters like Clem Kadiddlehopper, Cauliflower McPugg, and the Mean Widdle Kid became audience favorites. He also appeared in films like Du Barry was a Lady, where he costarred with another red head, Lucille Ball. ♪ Du Barry was a lady ♪ ♪ No matter what they may say ♪ ♪ Du Barry was a lady ♪ ♪ The fairest gal of her day ♪ - Oh Louis are you gonna play this thing again? - Would you accept this little token? - Oh darling! Oh you really shouldn't have done that. Oh Louis, I just can't accept this. - Oh please do. - No really, I just can't. - All right, give it back. ♪ It's friendship, friendship ♪ ♪ Just a perfect blendship ♪ ♪ When other friendships go up in smoke ♪ ♪ Ours will still be oke ♪ (upbeat orchestral music) ♪ Good evening friend ♪ - [Narrator] 1944 was an eventful year for Skelton. He divorced his wife, Edna, got drafted into the army and married his second wife, Georgia Davis. After the war, Skelton returned to radio, and in 1946, the Ziegfeld Follies was released. - [Announcer] Ziegfeld Follies marks the beginning of a startling new era, in the world of entertainment. The Ziegfeld Follies is music and magic, laughter, romance and America's most beautiful girls. - [Narrator] The film was actually shot in 1944, but released in 1946. In it, Red reprises his Guzzler's Gin routine, renamed for the movie, When Television Comes. (whistling) 1948 saw the release of more Skelton films like, the classic comedy, The Fuller Brush Man. A Southern Yankee, and Neptune's Daughter. ♪ Three little words ♪ ♪ Oh what I'd give for that one little phrase ♪ - [Narrator] In 1950, he starred in one of his biggest hits, Three Little Words. - He'll like it, huh? - Sure, sure, it's a nice little tune. You ought to do something with it sometime. You ought to do something with that shirt, too. - [Announcer] Three Little Words is a grand story, a true story, based on the lives and music of two of America's greatest song writers, Kalmar and Ruby. Fred as Bert Kalmar, Red as Harry Ruby. - Ball took a bad huff. - A bad huff, a bad huff, we go to rehearsal in two weeks, what am I gonna tell Sam Harris? The balls took a bad huff? He'll be delighted. You and your baseball, every time I turn around you're playing baseball. That's for kids, kids stuff! - I suppose magic's for grown ups? - And then we sat down and wrote, ♪ Who's sorry now, who's sorry now ♪ ♪ Who's sorry now ♪ - And then we stood up and wrote, ♪ So long oolong, how long you going a row ♪ ♪ Maybe I'll live a life of regret ♪ ♪ And maybe I'll give much more than I get ♪ ♪ But never the less I'm in love with you ♪ - [Narrator] Later on in 1950, Red was also seen in Watch the Birdie and the Yellow Cab Man. - I'm sorry I was late, I'm working on a new invention. A bumper for automobiles with a rubber stamp on it. When you hit a pedestrian, it says knocked out in California. (baby fussing) (explosion booming) - [Narrator] In 1951, television antenna's were springing up all over America. Many of Red's contemporary's like Milton Berle and Jack Benny, were enjoying success on TV. Earlier in 1949, Skelton had moved his radio program over to CBS and was being paid $10,000 per show. But, he retained his rights to make a separate television deal, as he had done with his MGM film contract. So in 1951, Red signed with NBC Television reportedly for 5.5 million over seven years. There was probably no other performer more ready for the weekly demands of television than Red Skelton. (applause) - Thank you very much ladies and gentleman. It's always quite flattering to get a reception without doing anything. I would like to thank you for allowing me to come into your living room, and this as you know, is my first televised broadcast. I have working in every branch of show business but television, and tonight opens that for me. I played a lot of night clubs lately.

I'd like to call your attention to one thing, it has the original rust proof job on it here. It has it's original rust, we'll get back to our movie and more about our car in just a few minutes. - [Narrator] Here's Red in an early television sketch doing more Beaverhead with a cameo appearance by the Mean Wittle Kid. - I see where Joe Staleen is trying to find a serum that will make him younger. Well that's not possible but if you leave it up to us, we'll see that you don't get any older. (laughing) Now I would like to tell you about our American movie. The night this movie, it was not shot under water, it just looks that way. This picture has murder, robbery, terror, hate, revenge, it's a story about boy and his dog. It stars Arrow Flynn, he plays two parts. Both a brother and a sister. Still no good. Hello, are you there, are you there? Would you get me Fort Knox please in Kentucky, yes. United States of America, we don't have a Kentucky in England, you know! Hello, Fort Knox? How are you-- (laughing) And now I'd like to tell you about our sponsor. Our sponsor is good ol' Clavedon's Crumpet Juice. Clavedon's Crumpet Juice comes in different sizes. Now here's the small size to carry around, and there's a prize in every package.

(laughing) I got to hurry, I'm gonna be late for school. (gun shots blasting) - I think what would be very good would be to have a large, green mixed salad. - A mixed green salad for a thousand men? Oh let's not get sickening, boy. Good heavens, we'll get it all fixed up then I'll go out here and get it for you. - All right you go right ahead, bring it in if I've gotta cook it, boy, gotta bring it in here. - [Narrator] Another radio favorite, Willy Lump Lump soon made his television debut. - There we are, hey, you get that down at the dump? Good, good. This is will be nuts in no time. Well, here we go. (laughing) (upbeat orchestral music) (yelling) (plates shattering) (pans rattling) (gun shots firing) All that meat and no potatoes. (laughing) (talking over each other) - At ease. Well, sergeant, take this mess down to the dump. - Wait a minute. You can't take me down to no dump. I'm Willy Lump Lump. - Oh lay down, I know garbage when I see it. - [Narrator] But his radio character of J. Newton Numbskull was an early television casualty. - At this time, I will endeavor to hypnotize this beautiful lady. Look me straight in the eye. - I can't. - Why? You're cockeyed. (laughing) - [Narrator] Television allowed Skelton to use his superb talent of pantomime. Skills he developed to perfection since his earliest days in show business. These routines were of course impossible to perform on radio. (laughing) - That Willy Lump Lump's been gone for five days now, staggering around town from joint to joint. Well believe me, he's gonna learn his lesson this time. Just wait till he wakes up. - Aren't you scared to put him in that room? It might frighten him to death. - Well maybe but I've warned him before too many times. I said, "Willy, listen to me, one of these days "you're gonna come in here so high you won't be "able to get down." Well this is it. - (mumbles) heaven's sake. They have revealed the laws of gravity. - [Narrator] Trying to push TV to its limits, he experimented with special effects, like this bizarre topsy turvy room. - Oh no! I gotta get some sleep. (mumbles) Oh good heavens. I gotta rest for a minute. Oh. Oh. (laughing) (applause) (mumbles) lay down. I didn't realize that, that's what I need. (laughing) - [Narrator] His success was immediate and Skelton was honored with two Emmy's. One for being the best comedian, and one for best comedy series during 1951. Red's debut season on TV. - And I would like to thank the ladies and gentleman of the press, and also the ladies and gentleman of the Academy for voting our show twice. One is they like our show, and the other is they like me as a comedian. Well, you've seen 'em now, so Ed you wanna take them? (applause) You know it was really quite a thrill to get something like that, you know, and over at the Academy it's a funny thing. As I walked in, there were a lot of people outside and someone yelled, "Red Skelton's in the crowd!" And they all turned around and looked at me, Gee, I was so embarrassed. I was sorry I yelled. (laughing) The autograph collectors, they had a cute idea for the stars, they would let 'em sign full sheets of paper, and for the pit players, a half a sheet of paper. You ever try to autograph a spit ball? Well, a little richer this week. Came in they want pet mice, I said, "What do you want "with mice," they said, "They don't brush their teeth, "they don't take a bath or anything," he says, "They don't tell one of 'em to move over, "he got a new buddy from now on." They went over to Gene Fowler's house the other day and they raided his coo-coo clock. This is the truth, they took a little coo-coo out of the clock, so I says, "Why did you do that?" He'd go, "Well I didn't mean no harm by it you know. "I saw the coo-coo and I thought maybe I could get some coo-coo eggs and raise my own clocks." - [Narrator] And somehow with all this going on, 1951 saw Red appearing in feature films like Excuse my Dust and Texas Carnival. (whistling) - Come on, boys. ♪ Waste no time, my friends the eyes of Texas are upon you ♪ ♪ Just one dime, step up and try your luck ♪ ♪ And don't begin that clippity clop until (mumbles) ♪ ♪ Take your time, your time ♪ ♪ (mumbles) grab your gal, don't hesitate ♪ - [Narrator] Right at the crest of popularity, 1952 and 1953 saw more films like Lovely to Look at, The Great Diamond Robbery, and one of his last films for MGM, The Clown, a remake of the silent classic tearjerker, the Champ, showcase Skelton's considerable dramatic talent. - Goldie's got me a television deal. Coast to coast a half hour program. A half hour, the DoDo Delman show. - No kidding! - Yeah, we start rehearsals tomorrow. I got a lot of slow material, too. - I bet ya have! - I'm glad you're gonna be around to help me because I'm gonna kill the people. - I always said you could! - There's no reason why I can't stage a come back. - The old slam! - You'll be better than ever! - We'll travel all over, personal appearances and everywhere! Philadelphia, Chicago, Hollywood, Miami, boy we'll really-- (laughing) - [Announcer] Yes, sir, the clown has everything. A great show to see and hear. Combining heartbreak with hilarious fun. - [Narrator] Towards the end of 1953, Red was undergoing personal problems, including a ruptured hernia in his diaphragm which caused breathing difficulties. His TV show suffered and NBC dropped the show. But after recovering, Red performed live at the Sahara Hotel in Las Vegas. He was such a hit that CBS immediately signed him to a TV contract, and Red never forgot the NBC snub. - Good evening, ladies and gentleman. Welcome to the-- (dramatic music) Taxi, taxi! - [Announcer] From television city in Hollywood, the new Red Skelton Show! - [Narrator] 1954 Red's TV show was chosen to present the Look Awards, of course, before giving out the awards, Red used the event to do an hilarious Marlon Brando send up. - Red, let's be sensible. There are a lot of great performances last year. - Oh sure. - What about Marlon Brando? - Yeah, what about him? - You mean that you think that you could be better than Marlon Brando? - Well the guy wasn't tough enough. He had no, wait, I'll show you what I mean. Here, give me a coat there. Hold my coat for me, will ya? Just as soon as I can get a little, atmosphere in this room, I'll show you how I would play the thing. All right, fella. (laughing) Hey, you've seen big Jim around here? - Run along, sonny, and forget about big Jim. He's tough. - Yeah? I'm tough too. I'm on play stuff. I'm real, tough, tough, tough, tough, to become. I'm tough. Where I come from, it's so tough when a cat wants milk he hijacks a cow. - [Narrator] Then Red got down to the almost serious business of giving out the awards. - Congratulations, there's your award. - Well, thanks Red and I want to thank the editors of Look Magazine for this wonderful honor. - Well, gee, I gotta tell you one thing about my little boy, Richard, he came in the other day, and I said, "What's a matter, you look tired, you look a bit (mumbles)". He said, "Well naturally I'm a bit drawen. "I was up last night watching television and I got Disney spells." (laughing) So you can't blame him, see, Valentina, my daughter writes his material. Again, congratulations. Ladies and gentleman, Mr. Walt Disney. And I was flattered backstage when Mr. Hitchcock looked at me and he compared me to you. - He did, oh. - He looked up and he says, "That Skelton's a real lemon." - You squeezed that one for all it's worth, didn't you? - Yeah. Congratulations, ladies and gentleman, Jack Lemmon. You know, I don't like to be catty or anything, but I could have actually been the star of Country Girl. - What do you mean, play my part? - No, Grace Kelly, but I turned it down. - I don't think you ever could have passed the physical, Red. - Yeah, well, (laughing). Yeah, I didn't get that till just now. (laughing) Well, Bing, I'd like to ask you just one little thing. - What, Red? - Well, I'd like to do a picture with you sometime. - Why? - I wanna make Bob Hope feel insecure. (laughing) - [Narrator] By 1955, Red was firmly established on CBS. - Good evening, ladies and gentleman. Here we are in studio 31 at CBS Television city in Hollywood, where the new Red Skelton Show presented by PET, evaporated milk and Instant PET nonfat dry milk is about to begin. (gentle orchestral music) (gasping) - Oh, good heavens. No wonder it got so warm last night. Oh. Oh brother, I gotta take a shower. I gotta get a shower. Oh nothing like-- (laughing) All right, oh by the way, this robe was made by my own little wife, Georgia. And if anybody says it's ridiculous, you're right. (laughing) Well they didn't make me do it, it's just that I'm proud. - Good morning, Mr. Skelton. - Oh good morning, good morning, good morning. You and that sauerkraut juice again. - My word, it's horribly stuffy in here. - Yeah. - I think someone ought to open a window. - I think so too. Got so hot in here last night, I thought I'd have to get up and take off my socks in the middle of the night. - Really? - Somebody ought to open that window, you know. - Somebody should, definitely. - All right, I can take a hint, I'll do it. - That's you. (mumbles) (choking) I think it's gonna be a nice day. (laughing) - Come along, Mr. Skelton, come along. You've got to drink your sauerkraut juice tonic. Yes, I sais sauerkraut juice, but it's the doctor's orders. Now listen, Mr. Skelton, sir. If you don't drink this juice then you can't have your hot chocolate, with that delicious wholesome PET milk for breakfast. - He's gonna be around here a long time. (laughing drowns out speaker) - Drink it all down like a good boy. - Like a good boy, down the hatch. - That's much better now, not not not bad was it? - No, it was all bad. - I'll straighten up your bread-- - My bread? - Oh. - I buttered it so (mumbles). - Mr. Skelton, you ought to be ashamed of yourself. Playing with your son Richard's toys again. - Well that's a normal sort of a thing, gee, I mean, weren't you ever a little boy? - Of course not, much too undignified. - Oh. - Skelton, tell me, what else of young Richard's have you smuggled into this room? - Oh nothing, I got nothing else. - Ah-ha, ah-ha! - There's nothing in here! There's nothing in here! (talking over each other) - Oh, you felon! - I'm what? - I said, you felon. - And don't you forget it. - Dear, even his little chemical set. - Well I've always been interested in chemistry. You know that one time I tried to figure out something that would kill gophers? - And did it kill gophers? - Well the stuff I mixed didn't exactly kill 'em but it made everything smell so bad they left on their own. - Really, sir, are you gonna mix up something? - Are you interested in it? - I am, I'll get the table. - Oh, I'm with you, bring it right over here. - (mumbles) thank you. I'll get the pitcher. - You get the pitcher, yeah, can you get me-- - All ready sir. - Let's see what should we start off with? - Hydrogen peroxide. - Oh splendid. - Oh that ought to do it. Phosphorus chloride. - Oh how (mumbles). - You wouldn't believe that, but if it wasn't written here I wouldn't be able to say it. And here is one. This is zinc nitrate. - Zinc nitrate? - Zinc nitrate, and you may not know this, but the nitrate is much cheaper than the day rate. (laughing) You get it? Nitrate, and day rate? - Yes of course I get it. Very, very funny (mumbles) when I'm off duty I'll go and have a hearty laugh. (laughing) - Well here we are, we'll put a little of this in here, that little sulfur that'll do it. (talking over each other) I don't want it! It's some sand! Throw it out the window! - Mr. Skelton! Let's stop behaving like children, now come along, you take it! - What are you doing, I don't want it! Open the window! - Get it out, get it out! Just in time. You know you might have blown the whole house down. - There was a lady out there drying clothes. - What's happened? - The smog cleared up, was all. You should always remember that when anything starts foaming, the smog cleared up? The smog cleared up! Good heavens! - Mr. Skelton! Do you know what you been gone and done? - No, what I have I been and gone and done? - You just discovered the formula for eliminating smog! (applause) - Patience, patience, patience, patience. Now as you all know, only this morning we offered a reward of 10 million dollars-- (talking over each other) 10 million dollars, yes, for anyone who could come up with the solution for smog. Now, I beg you to be patient. Somebody's sure to come up with the right answer. - Well they better! (talking over each other) - [Crowd] Down with smog, down with smog. - Gentleman of the smog control board, this is serious, nobody's come up with an answer yet. - I've come up with a wonderful idea-- - No, we have only a few minutes before we can find an answer-- - Look, I don't know if you know it or not, but I am a fella that-- - Now have any of you any suggestions? - Don't you see me standing here? - Don't you see me ignoring you?

Sam, don't you see I have a visitor? - Sam? - Oh, pardon me, let me introduce you. This is Red Skeleton, this is Sam Skeleton. - Yeah, hi. - That's Sam? - He's a very interesting man. The only trouble he hasn't got much hair. - He hasn't got much Sam either. - So long, Sam. - See ya later, Sam. Well, it was nice seeing you, Peter, I'll see y-- - Red, we'll have to have a drink. Darling, darling, shall we have some drinks? You have to have one. - Ah! - Voltura, meet Red Skeleton. - How are ya, glad to meet ya. - You look like a real dead wire to me. - Oh this kid's slab happy. - Shall we have a toast? - To a short life, and a miserable one. - Do you sleep on a perch? - Bottoms up. - Well I don't drink myself. Pete, I've been poisoned! What have you given me? (mumbles) - It's just plain water, isn't it darling? - Of course. - Just plain water. - Are you sure just plain water? Maybe that's why it tastes so funny. I've been drinking nothing but PET Milk for the last three weeks. - Well, nice spooking to you. - Oh, you know she's a very nice ghoul. - So nice, so cadaveris you know. Now, Red, about my comedy show, I think I'd like to start it off with a rousing musical number. You have any advice? - Well-- - Oh well just as brilliantly. Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful. - I said nothing. - As long as it's a comedy, I think we should have jokes, huh? - Oh yeah, that would help, yeah jokes. You wanna do jokes, huh? Boy well I'll tell ya what, you'll need funny hats. You got any hats around? Couple right here, here. Here. Ooh. Here, where'd you get these, I haven't seen these kind in years. - It belongs to my pall bearers. - Oh yeah. All comedians wear funny hats, see. - Now I'm funny. - Believe me. - Okay. - Now look, here's what I'll do. We meet on the street and I say, "Hello Pete." And you say, "Hello, Red." And I say, "We got a new baby at our house." And you say, "Is it gonna stay?" And then I tell a joke, you got it? - Uh-huh got it. - Here we go. Boy, yes it is. Wow. Hello. Hi ya, Pete. - Hello, Red. - We got a new baby in our house. - Is it a boy or a girl? - What difference does it make? - Makes a lot of difference, ask any baby. - Look, all you gotta do is to come up to me, I say, we got a baby at our house, and you say, "Is it gonna stay?" And then I tell you, you see? Oh. Hi ya, Pete. - Hi Red. - We got a new baby at our house. - Is it, can't I even ask how the mother is? - It's just a joke. - It's no joke to the mother. - Look all you gotta say is, "Is it gonna stay?" And I tell the joke, you got it? - Got it. - Oh gee. Hi, oh no we didn't rehearse this. How are ya, Pete? - Hi Red. - We got a new baby at our house. - Is it going to stay? - I guess so, it's got it's clothes off. (laughing) Ya! - Fine, now we got the joke, now. I'd like to do a domestic comedy, naturally. - Yes. - You know, husband wife, like Jackie Gleason does. Honeymooners, you know? Do you have some advice? - Well-- - Oh, Red this is one! I've got to call my writer. - I didn't say anything. - I've got to call my writer! This is brilliant. This guy's good. - Oh no! Oh, no! Oh, you've stolen my writers! - Aren't they an intelligent group of writers, huh? Introduce them to you. This is Joe, this is Lou, and this-- - You don't have to tell me who this is. This is the guy that gave these other writers PBS network. Interesting subject right here-- (upbeat orchestral music) - [Narrator] Red appeared on the CBS drama series, Climax, in an original teleplay called Public Pigeon Number One. - One of the traditions of show business is all comedians want to play Hamlet. The funnier the clown, the more tragic are his acting aspirations. Well now tonight we are not going to do Hamlet, but we do have the pleasure of presenting one of America's great comedians, Mr. Red Skelton in his dramatic debut on television. We ask just one thing. As this is serious drama, please please try to keep from laughing, please try. And now ladies and gentleman, Red Skelton, starring in Public Pigeon Number One, co-starring Ann Rutherford, tonight on Climax. - [Lieutenant] Morning everybody. - Hi ya there, Lieutenant Freely. - [Lieutenant] Hello, Rusty. - Rusty. - Yeah? - What did you say the name of that company was? - White Eagle Mines, class A. - Thank you. - Thank you. What ya gonna have there, Lieutenant? - You didn't pick up your tip. - Oh, it'll be there when I want it. After all, how far can a dime go these days? - Oh, just give me a glass of milk, Rusty. - Glass a milk, huh? Anything new down at headquarters, Lieutenant? - Don't you ever read the newspapers? - Well I try to, but it's pretty hard to read upside down you know. - Oh here, here. (dramatic orchestral music) There's a $10,000 reward for the capture of those electronic swindlers, but we'll get 'em. - Yeah, say, Lieutenant. Have you heard anything about a stock called White Eagle Mines? - [Lieutenant] Have I ever heard about it? That one's the pip. - Oh you don't say? - That's not even worth the paper it's written on. - No! I'm sorry, that milk is awful fresh today. I'm sorry, are you sure about those stocks? Those dirty swindlers. How much reward did you say, Lieutenant? Did you say $10,000? It's all right, mister, don't worry about it at all. Pretty hard to keep food down in this restaurant. Everybody complains. - You're fired! - Fired? Well aren't you gonna give me some sort of notice? That's notice enough. It broke on both sides. Gee. When things go good, I'll see you around, Lieutenant. - All right. - It'll come in handy now. - Oh Rusty. Well it had to happen, it always does. - I'm sorry Edith. Maybe it's for the best, though. - The best, how could you say that? - Well I had to force myself. - [Narrator] In 1956 while guest hosting on the Shower of Stars, a fellow CBS star paid Red a surprise visit. - What's going on out there? - [Red] Hey, Jack Benny! (applause) - Red, what's happening here? I came over here to do a show. Found no place to park my car. They didn't give me a dressing room. Even the make up man, he didn't have my name on the list. - Well you're not supposed to be on this show, Jack. - What? - No, you see the show tonight is a shower devoted to the talent and artists's, artists, rather. (laughing) Talent artists who have sold a million. - So, oh, I thought it was saved a million. Oh, I'm terribly sorry, really. I didn't know, I'm awfully sorry. (applause) (laughing) - You know he's not kidding about money. He fries bacon in lucks so it won't shrink. - [Narrator] Skelton had made his last movie for MGM in 1953, and with a heavy TV schedule, his film output slowed down. But in 1956 he was back on the screen in Mike Todd's epic Around the World in 80 Days. 1957 saw an interesting development. Red's final starring feature film was based on his 1955 television production of Public Pigeon Number One. ♪ Don't chicken, chicken ♪ ♪ Knock me for a loop ♪ ♪ Show me lots of lovin' ♪ - [Announcer] You may as well settle down for a lot of long loud laughs. For here's just what the doctor ordered. A picture that sets a fast, furious and exciting pace in mirthful, melodious entertainment. Red may be Janet's big heartthrob, but to everyone else, he's just one pain in the neck. - You're fired, you hear me? You're fired! - [Announcer] The fun really starts when Red is tagged as Public Pigeon Number One by stock swindlers who pose as government agents. - I solemnly pledge. - To uphold the principles of the bureau. - To uphold the principles of the bureau. - Through rain and sleet. - Through rain and sleet. - Till death do us part. - Till death, you sure we're not getting married? I'm a G man. - What? - Sh! - What kind of a signature is this? - Mine. - Peter Rabbit? - Oh that, it's a nickname. Kids used to call me Peter Rabbit because of the way I had of walking like this. Hippity hop, hippity hop, hippity hop. - [Narrator] By the end of the '50s and early '60s, Red was a television fixture, with many of his characters as famous as he was. - [Announcer] A special message from Red Skelton, to all his little friends. - Hi, you know I sure am lucky to have a job where I can wear 20 faces and try to make people laugh. But I got a surprise for you. You know who that is? Freddie the Freeloader and this is Clem Kadiddlehopper and Dead Eye, friends of mine. Yours too, I hope. Well, the PET Instant folks have made these wonderful masks especially so that you can have as much fun with 'em as I do. - It's always fun shopping in the dump today. One, two, three, four, five, six. All right, I do believe I've died and gone to heaven. Boy that smog's getting worse everyday. That's not the peas, that's the smog. I'll gorge myself tonight. Beans, oh I love beans. One, two, three, four, no, there's three. One of 'ems moving. Everybody out now. Oh, an egg, an egg, now why would anyone throw an egg away, it says, oh it must be a brand name. It's McCoyen. International Airport 1959. Now why would, phew! Personality all right. Oh good heavens! - Oh there's the bell. - All right, Mr. Wentworth. - What are they remaking, the great wall? - Perspiration. - What's wrong with that? - It'll ruin my makeup. - Oh come on, Mr. Wentworth, knock him out. - Wait a minute, are you (mumbles). - My dear boy, those are the ideal conditions. - You're not getting me (mumbles). - I did it. - You hit me. - I did. - Yes. - I did it! - Oh come on. Oh come on. He's the kind of fight that I wanna do all the time, it's the first one I ever won! - [Man] (mumbles) come here. - (mumbles) you were magnificent! - Was I really? How about a kiss? (mumbles) - But this is Tuesday night, Red Skelton show. We have a script all prepared here for you if you'll just look this over here now. - Oh Lord, you must be clowning. I couldn't do Red's characters. - But this is what Red wants you to do. - Yeah, but the public would think I flipped my wig. - No but look, we have the set, we have the costumes. We have the script right here. - But Dick, you don't understand. I'm not a comedian. People would just laugh at me. - We can only hope. - [Narrator] It isn't easy to picture anyone else doing a Red Skelton character, but how about Ed Sullivan? Well, it happened one night in 1961 when Red was sick and CBS asked the great stone face to fill in. (applause) - Howdy folks, howdy! (applause drowns out speaker) Always tripping me up. Getting embarrassing. (mumbles) Have to do it the hard way. (gun shot blasts) That's what I always needed, open toed toes. - This must be Freddie the Freeloader. - Either that or a Russian trick, be careful. - Let's wake him up. - Maybe a rouge. Wake up, you-- - Gentleman, you are invading my boudoir. - Are you Eddie the Freeloader? - Yes, and no. - Yes and no? - Yes, if you have a care package. No if you are coppers. - [Narrator] During the early '60s, another facet of Red's talent surfaced. His musical ability, which included the release of an album of Skelton conducting a full orchestra. Red's fame had taken on international proportions, even to the special program for the delegates of the United Nations. (applause) - [Announcer] Mr. Skelton's first pantomime will be that of The Fool and the Feather. (speaking in foreign language) (chuckling) - [Narrator] Red's show became so popular, that in 1962, CBS expanded the program to one hour. And on the very first Skelton hour, Red was joined in the silent spot by another beloved clown, Harpo Marx. (gentle orchestral music) (bomb booming) Week after week, Skelton rolled out his Louie cast of characters to the delight of his millions of fans. Like the mild mannered George Appleby. (gun shots blasting) - Didn't I see you in the yellow pages? - No! (gun shots blasting) - You're a bloody mess to be coming now. He's dead. He's dead. There must be a way out of here. Oh. - [Narrator] Bolivar Shagnasty. - That's pretty good, Chester's got one of 'em going, he's got two of 'em. So you scarface, huh? - Who is this crumb? - Who you calling a crumb? - You, that's who. - Okay, I just wanna know which crumb you were referring to. - This is Bolivar Shagnasty. - Yeah, that's spelled with two small snag shags and one big nasty. We all had bets on it. - Bolivar, Bolivar, this is Mr. Scarface. And these are his two boys. - Oh, your boys, huh? Will the real scarface step forward, please? (skin smacking) One of us was wrong somewhere. - Did you get the message? - I got the massage. I was right the first time, I got the massage. - Scarface, sir, Bolivar made the most delicious beer you ever tasted. - Yeah, that's real beer, that's the real bathtub beer. - Are you crazy? I make the greatest beer. - Are you kidding? My beer's 25 proof. Course, yours is better, it's 38. - [Narrator] Dead Eye. - Anybody wanna buy him? (mumbles) This is the only horse in the world with a built in u-turn. Here, take him over to the blacksmith's shop and get him some elevator shoes. Every time he runs, his stomach dribbles. Hey, where's the dancing girls? What happened to my gal, Sue? Hey Sue? Sue! Georgie! Hey bartender. Who's that hombre? - Why that's Hondo, the fastest man on the draw in the west. - Don't be silly, I'm the fasted man on the draw! (gun shot blasts) Not even John Wayne can't do that. I figure any time a prop gets a bigger laugh than me it's gotta go. - [Narrator] Conman Sam Fernando Red. - I wanna watch (mumbles). - Why? - We may have to eat these things. - Look, here they come. - Yeah, get behind the stand, we'll be heard (mumbles). - Guess they got away. - Yeah, I guess you're right. Well, it's not a total loss. Why not? - Oh come on San Fernando. We just gotta get rid of these hot furs. - Yeah, we'll find some way to do it. Uh-oh, here comes a prospect. (laughing) Here comes a sucker, you keep an eye out for the cops, I'll sell him a coat. Say, pardon me sir. You look like an intelligent sucker. I mean, how would you like to buy a genuine $2,000 mink coat for only $500? - I don't think so, there must be a catch to it. - Neighbor, I'm gonna level with you. These coats fell off a truck that was headed to Beverly Hills, yeah, I tried to get the driver's attention, I yelled as loud as I could, but I was under a difficult condition. - Difficult condition? - I had my mouth closed. Now, it's a real bargain friend. A $2,000 coat for $500. Buy it for your mother. - No. - Your sister. Wife? Well how about if you've got a wife, how about your girlfriend? - Say, that is a lovely coat. Yes, oh that's beautiful. - Yes it is. - It's gorgeous. - How about that bullheaded mink? Oh, don't I'm allergic, I'm... - Ah-choo! - [Narrator] And during the '60s, there was still time for a movie or two like a cameo appearance in Oceans Eleven. In the 1965 feature, those magnificent men in their flying machines, Red puts in a hilarious final film appearance portraying man's early and unsuccessful attempts to fly. Skelton's television shows were filled with memorable moments, but some of them were not planned, and it's during these unrehearsed events we can see Skelton's genius for ad libbing. - Flossy, what do you say? - Young man? - Oh! - Now take it easy young man, I'm harmless. - Oh, you're harmless, I'm glad to meet ya, I'm Clem Kadiddlehopper. - My name is Swathmartin, J.P. Swathmartin. - No kidding. - Hey, that's a mighty fine looking cow you got here. - Isn't that a hunk of beef for ya? Good boy, that's a nice cow. (laughing) Joyful cow, not only does she give milk. But she gives Pepperidge pies. - Feel this muckle. Wait a minute, over here, oh there it is, feel. Right there, feel it. How's that for a muscle? - Feels like a wart on a rubber band. - Yeah, that's fun, see two can play at that little game. - Move it over. What do you think I got down here, a duck? (laughing) - Oh they all seem to want this little black box all of a sudden. I wonder what could be in it. I better not open it. I'll just take a peek. No, I better not either. I'll just pretend it's not there, that's what I'll do. I wonder what it is though. Oh gee, if I could just say what I did at rehearsal now. (laughing) - Sounded desperate, his voice was blood curdling. - Sounded like your mother. - What are we gonna do? - I don't know, what you got in mind? - Going down to Florida, we got-- - Telegram for ya, Mr. Skeleton. Elton, Elton. - You said skeleton. This is that Texan I was telling you about. A telegram? - Yeah. - Where from, sir? - Western Union. - I'll read it. (mumbles) Now that shows ya how you can get excited reading lines, you know you get everything mixed up. Blah, blah, blah, (mumbles) oh. - You brought a whole army of mosquitoes. - I'd like to see you do that again. I'd like to see you do that again. - I just did it. - I had my eyes closed, I didn't see it. Thank you! - Welcome. Cherio. - Right-oh. - Right-oh. - Any more? Shut up, we got one more. - [Narrator] In 1970, after 17 years on the network, CBS canceled the Skelton Show. Although the program was still very strong in the ratings, the network had decided it wanted to go after a younger, more urbane audience. It also said the weekly production budget of over $200,000 per week was too high. And so, ironically in 1970 and '71 found Red back at NBC where it all started 20 years earlier. (upbeat music) - [Announcer] Stop! Look! And laugh. - Wow! How sweet it is. - [Announcer] With Red and his guest star. - [Narrator] As the mid '70s came along, Red was off television on a regular basis. But he kept very active making numerous stage appearances, writing and conducting music, and painting. And later in the '80s, Red forged new ground entertaining yet another generation with his cable TV specials and live concerts. And in 1986, the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences awarded Red their highest honor. The Governor's Award. For over 60 years, Red Skelton has delighted us with his simple, straight forward approach to comedy. He enjoyed making us laugh and usually made himself laugh, as well. It's an honest laughter filled with an American spirit that is so much a part of his soul. Richard Red Skelton, a national treasure and beloved clown. - Thank you very much, ladies and gentleman. I sincerely hope that I haven't said or done anything to offend anyone. If I did, I really didn't mean to. I do hope that you had as much fun as I had. It's really a lot of fun to try and make people laugh. I personally believe that each and every one of us was put here for a purpose, that's to build and not to destroy. And if by chance someday you're not feeling well, and you should remember some silly little thing that I've said or done, and it brings back a smile to your face or a chuckle to your heart, then my purpose has been served. For my fellow man. May I wish you all continued success and God bless and good night. (upbeat orchestral music)
