In November 2015, - Islamic State gunmen killed 130 civilians in Paris. 90 died at the Bataclan theater alone. The war had begun ten months earlier... ...a stone's throw from the Bataclan at the offices of satirical magazine "Charlie Hebdo." This is the story of the three-day manhunt for the killers of "Charlie Hebdo"... and of the first Islamic State attack on Paris. "Charlie Hebdo" had kept a low profile since publishing cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad nine years earlier. There were no signs or nameplates to guide visitors to their office, now sealed up. Across the hallway was TV production company Premières Lignes. That morning, the journalists of "Charlie Hebdo" were in their meeting room, planning the next issue. Just after 11:20, two gunmen pulled up outside the building in a small black car. At the front entrance, the gunmen had murdered Frédéric Boisseau, a maintenance man. They didn't know the layout of the building and went to the third floor, the floor above "Charlie Hebdo," where a mail carrier was delivering a parcel to a film company. While the gunmen blundered through the building, looking for "Charlie Hebdo," the staff at Premières Lignes barricaded their door. In "Charlie Hebdo's" meeting room, no one had heard a thing. Cartoonist Corinne Rey, known as "Coco," was heading out to collect her daughter from day care. The gunmen forced Coco to take them to "Charlie Hebdo" and punch in the door code. The security camera recorded the moment the gunmen marched Coco into the reception area. One of them shot the web designer, then went to find the writers and cartoonists of "Charlie Hebdo." As the gunmen opened fire, the staff of Premieres Lignes escaped onto the roof, directly above the "Charlie Hebdo" meeting room. The gunmen had spent less than two minutes at "Charlie Hebdo." They had fired 36 shots. Now they headed back down to the street. As the Premières Lignes staff escaped across the rooftops, three policemen on bicycles arrived, unaware that a terrorist attack was underway. Police officer - Ahmed Merabet had fired at the gunmen's car as they tried to escape. The attack had lasted - 15 minutes. The gunmen had murdered twelve people, ten of them at "Charlie Hebdo." Among the first on the scene was an emergency doctor who happened to be close by. The police were stunned by the murder of their comrade and they still had no idea about the massacre at "Charlie Hebdo," just one street away. Less than two miles from "Charlie Hebdo" the gunmen had decided to switch cars. Forensic teams examined the abandoned car and found the ID of a young Frenchman, Saïd Kouachi. Chérif and Saïd were French citizens, born in Paris. Chérif was 32, Saïd 34. As the bodies of "Charlie Hebdo's" writers and cartoonists were taken away, the people of Paris came out into the streets. While the crowds stood vigil, another young Frenchman was preparing to attack Paris, this time in the name of a different terror group. Just after 8:00, the Islamic State gunman struck in Montrouge, a suburb of Paris. The bullet hit - Clarissa Jean-Philippe, an unarmed community police officer who was standing next to Laurent. Clarissa Jean-Philippe never regained consciousness. Her murderer disappeared into the streets of Paris. Then, as detectives began the hunt for Clarissa's killer, the Kouachi brothers resurfaced 50 miles from Paris. Saïd carried a bazooka. But they had only come to get snacks. The brothers had vanished as suddenly as they'd appeared. It was 22 hours since the massacre at "Charlie Hebdo." As hundreds of gendarmes locked down the roads north of Paris, detectives in the capital made a breakthrough in their hunt for Clarissa's killer. The "Charlie Hebdo" killers had spent the night in the woods, 20 miles from where they were last seen. Just before dawn they hijacked a car. The driver was unharmed and called the police. The Kouachis stopped at a print shop in the small town of Dammartin. The owner was having coffee with his employee, Lilian. A half hour passed while the bandage was adjusted. Gendarme negotiators had been trying to contact the Kouachi brothers, but the media had got there first. As the Kouachi brothers dominated the headlines... Coulibaly, in his martyrdom video, tried to grab some of the credit for himself. That Friday lunchtime, Coulibaly drove to a kosher grocery store shortly before it was due to close for the Jewish Sabbath. The store's security cameras recorded him outside the front entrance with a heavy sports bag. As Coulibaly entered the grocery store, a group of customers fled down a stairway to the basement. Coulibaly found a customer hiding at the back of the grocery store. He dragged him to the cash registers and shot him dead. On the corner by the grocery store, a bystander recorded the arrival of the police. Once the steel shutter was closed, Coulibaly rounded up the hostages. Yoav Hattab was in the group that came up from the basement. When he looked around and saw the bodies of Coulibaly's first three victims, he decided to act. Yoav pulled the trigger but the weapon jammed. Coulibaly fired twice. Elite police units cleared the area and started to plan their attack. Inside the grocery store, Coulibaly had discovered Lassana's escape route, the fire exit at the side of the building. No. Once Coulibaly had finished talking to the media, he settled in for a long siege. As the siege wore on, a few hostages were able to call relatives and friends. Two and a half hours into the siege Coulibaly finally spoke to the police negotiator. At the print shop - 25 miles away, the gendarmes special forces waited. Seven hours into the siege, snipers spotted movement inside the print shop. As daylight faded, the Kouachi brothers decided it was time to die. 90 seconds after they'd come out of the print shop, the killers of "Charlie Hebdo" lay dead. Print shop employee, Lilian, was unhurt. He had hidden under a sink for eight hours. The plan was for a first assault team to blast their way in through the fire door. A second team would take the front entrance, unlocking the metal shutter with a key. Go, go, go, go! Two hours before he died, Coulibaly was recorded speaking to a hostage.
