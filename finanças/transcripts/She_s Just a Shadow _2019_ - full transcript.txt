- Just stick out your tongue and say ah, like you at the doctor. Oh no. - There's no real good word for what me and my mom do. You could say that we're lady pimps, pimpstresses, abadessas, or madams. My mom says that we're just as important as the government. Without us the whole city wouldn't function. The economy would collapse and the streets would run with blood. - Can you grab my phone and take some pictures? It'll be cool to post this later. - Night clubbing again. Fuck, I'm just night clubbing again. When I was sober I wanted to be drunk. Now that I'm drinking, all I want is to be sober. - Blue Sky. - But there's four of them and only two of us. We're stocked to Karate. - Karate got run over by a truck last month remember? - I'm sorry man. - Leaves no choice. - I'll attack first, you clean up the mess.

She was like a plastic sexy freak show. - I see what's going on here. You guys are kind of coveting that old man's fake wife. If you all like plastic so much, it will save you money if you just stuck your dicks in some rubber cement. - That's a good one Ma, that's a good one, she funny. - Old rich, old white motherfuckers building their 60s freak show girls from a scratch aside. I'm just a little upset about Karate though. - I'm sorry. - No, it's not your fault. It's just that everyone keeps asking me where Dr. Karate is and I have to explain like five times a day that he got run over by a truck. - That's pretty fucking real. - All right, definitely. - Thank you. - So. - Thank you. - Thank you. - It's good to see you man, it's good seeing you. - Yeah. - Jimmy. - Thanks friend. - Thank you for coming. - Hey, I'll see you out. - Hey what's wrong? - What? - What, are you mad or something? - No, I'm just tired. - Hey. - What? - Can I talk to you for a minute? - It was kind of confusing how I wound up taking over the black market and sex trade of the whole city. I don't know if I was lucky or smart or if my mom did it for me. - Ooh shit. - The now notorious serial killer has struck again. The remains of a young lady were found yesterday morning on these very tracks. Police have little information as to who they're looking for. The consistencies are that all his victims have been woman in their early 20s. Police don't know if this is one killer or multiple killers. What they do have evidence of is that the same man is involved in the murders because traces of his semen have been found on multiple victims. Social media is buzzing with nicknames for these now internationally known horrific crimes. One of the many reasons this is becoming such a panic is because this serial killer is actually posting videos of the murders online. - What are you trying to do Knockout? - The Train Track Ripper obviously-- - Scare the girls to death? - Shit my bad, I just turned on the TV. - What's on your mind? - The briefcase. - I haven't forgot about the bag man. I was just so glad we took those guys out. - I just feel weird about that briefcase. - Do you want half of whatever's inside of it? - I don't want anything that's inside of it. I just think we should get rid of it. What's in it? - I don't know, probably gold, diamonds. I don't know, you sure you don't want half. Let's check. Yep, it's coke. - I don't think it's coke man, it gives bad energy. - Nope, it's definitely good white flake. Not bad energy, sometimes gold is white. - Hey mister, can you spare some change? - Here's a coin, there you go. - I wish I was big and strong like you. - Cute dog man. - I'm running low on coke. - Ah. - Each time I opened my eyes, the sun was blotted out a little more. Hello. - Hey man, how it's going? - Red Hot, I don't think I can keep partying man. I'm getting too old or something. - Too old for what? Don't start pussying out on me now. - This whole life thing man, I can't handle it. I'm not good at it. - Dude, you just sound hung over. Drink your fucking beer, do your fucking blow, brush your fucking teeth, take a shower, and shut the hell up. I'm bringing Beth and Tanya to party with you. - Those are the two girls that I'm with. - They were literally snort halos of white powder around your sweaty miserable face. - That doesn't make any sense. - Dude, you got to get your head on straight. They're both Korea prostitutes. - They're still girls with feelings. - Yeah, kinda. - I just don't know if I can keep partying man. - Do you wanna go to heaven or hell tonight man. - Did you see that perv man? If he worked here, he'd be going nuts. - The train track ripper has struck again. It is now thought that he's murdered at least 10 women. All these victims are young women and the uniqueness of these horrible crimes is that they have all been bound to train tracks, apparently by a skilled Kinbaku practitioner. Having them run over by trains is his method of killing. Now there's currently a massive manhunt spanning the city. Obviously focused largely on train tracks and law enforcement agencies are trying to track him online because he won't stop posting videos of these gruesome murders. So far he continues to do this without leaving a trace of his whereabouts. This is Zach Eagmon reporting. - Why can't they catch this sick fuck already? - Police can't do anything right. - Red Hot, he had an endless appetite for more. There could never be enough money, he could never have enough power and I was never good enough. - Why are these roses here? - Some weird client sends them to me every few months, I don't know. You girls can take it if you want. - Red roses, how cliche. - I've been drunk and high for months now, getting weaker. I've always gotten everything that I wanted. I wanted a beautiful girl, and for my damnation my old friend gave my two. - Would you rather be really fucking high or sober right now? - High. - Me too. - So, why don't you guys just stay drunk or high all the time, because you're gonna die either way right? - Well that makes about as much sense as anything else. - I pick him, hello. Oh my God, be careful. - I wanted to be a model and wound up being a prostitute. - Oh. - Man might go out and rob someone or kill someone, we do this, this is better. We make people feel good, for them. - Hello, hi. - Someone's about to get some cash and chlamydia. - Hey, I want to bring two of you girls to the hotel across the street. - They kept finding mangled remains of women on the train tracks outside of town. That sicko was pushing his luck. - There she is, this is some darkness. I'm going to follow you right back to your nest. - He's okay. - He's good right? No, he's more than okay. - I'm going to fuck her so hard, I'm going to keep her in my basement for so long that she'll be pregnant by the time she dies. - Come on, he's fucking too much or something, but you know. It's great, he's cool. James Diamond, what are you doing on my side of town? - Red Hot, we know what you did. Blue Sky is not happy. You stole his shit. - Do I look happy to you right now James. Look me dead in the eyes and tell me that I look fucking happy. - Hey, Blue Sky told me to tell you that he misses you. He says the two of you were close when you were kids. - You and Blue Sky are gonna stay on your own side of town. Or I'm gonna have my security Knockout fuck your fat wife. How's that sound? - Other, he got hit by a truck. - That was my old security Dr. Karate dude. ♪ I wanted to protect one ♪ ♪ He doesn't see her gold one ♪ ♪ I want to bless our blood ♪ ♪ I want our blood to be one ♪ - With the mask on, I could do anything, be anyone. ♪ He couldn't see her true blood ♪ ♪ I want to ♪ - With the mask off, I'm Gaven, an ordinary human being.

It's like I need 10,000 virgin angels to carry me above it. You hungry? - Yeah, that looks good. There's two kinds of love. Strawberry love and Twinkie love. A Twinkie can sit there for decades and it'll still be creamy and sweet. A strawberry's juicy and also sweet, but if you leave it out it'll rot in just a couple of days. - Only a prostitute would say that. - Quiet now, caution, danger is approaching us as I speak. - Mom, what's happening.

We'll stay on our side of town, just let me reach my phone so I can make a call, and then we'll be out of here. I mean we understand, it's tough getting fucked up.

Let me get a little taste of that. - Thank you. - Die in peace. Die in peace. - Hmm, this is tasty. - Die, die, die in peace. - My mom said that The Ripper was too bad for the food that kills. She wanted to hurt him even worse than that. Mom, Uncle. - Mm-hmm. - I have a question. - Yes. - Is it true that Grandma always put poison in everything? - I didn't know you remembered that. Our mom went crazy towards the end. - She actually poisoned our brother. - You mean I had two uncles? - Yeah, I had another brother. But your grandma went mad and poisoned him. - And some other family and friends. She was just making up all kinds of poisoned food and candies, beautiful desserts. And soups and everything and just inviting everyone over for dinner all the time. - What's the secret family recipe for the food that kills? - It's better if you don't know that yet. - Just tell me Mom, it's just a recipe. - It's a secret recipe. - How did Grandma really die? - Snakes aren't immune to their own venom. - Grandma poisoned herself? - A snake eats its own tail. - Fuck. - Hey mister. - I know, I know, you want another coin. What are you, a token for pity? I give you a coin every day on my way to work, why don't you go to another block? - Can I just have a coin for some food mister? - I've told you like 10 times, my name is Knockout, yet you still call me mister. There's five coins, now I'm gonna strongly suggest you go to another block because I'm getting real tired of passing through your totem for pity every day on my way to work. - Frankie, what's that.

Do you wanna just split with me? Leave the country and have a fresh start? - Why are you teasing me? 'Cause that would be a really mean trick if you're teasing me. - Is that a yes? - It's definitely a yes. Please take me away from this horrible life and place. - Let's leave next week. - That sounds perfect. - Like she said, life was short.

I can't stop thinking about you. - You shouldn't care about me. - But I do. - We used to go over to my grandma's house all the time when I was a kid. We just didn't eat dinner ever. - That doesn't make any sense. - It does make sense. My grandma was crazy, so all the food was poisoned. All the water, all the saki, everything. I wasn't even allowed to eat candy over there. So we would go over there for dinner, we just wouldn't eat dinner. - So you would just sit there and talk and stare at your food. - That's all I've been trying to tell you for the past hour. My mom and I would go over there for dinner, we just never had dinner. - But you can see how this sounds confusing. You went over there for dinner, but you didn't go over there for dinner. - You ready to go home babe? - Yeah. - You got to help me figure this out first. She's saying that she and her mom used to go over to her grandma's house for dinner, but never had dinner at her grandma's house. - God Red Hot, she's just saying that they couldn't eat any of the food at her grandma's house because it was all poisoned, but they still visit her and not eat. - Now that makes a little more sense. But is that shit crazy? - Call me in the morning man. I gotta get some rest. - So you did or you didn't have dinner with the grandma? 'Cause it's kind of like not going over there for dinner. - I don't understand what you don't understand. My grandma is trying to poison her own family! - What are you saying? You gonna poison me? - That was weird. - You okay sweetheart? - Yeah, he's just wasted, that's all. Just go, Jesus. - Are you all right? - Just go! My dad was put in jail before I was born. He was let out less than a week before my 10th birthday. By the time my birthday came, he had already been shot and killed. One bullet in each eye. - I'm holding this whole thing together. You're out there fucking a bunch of other guys. - You've got enough money for us to leave town on. If you really want me to stop working and quit doing drugs, why don't we just leave the country. - If I make just a little bit more money, we can live however we want wherever we want. - If you're not gonna take me away from this horrible life that we both admittingly hate, will you at least take me to dinner? - Of course baby, come on. - The question for you is, not how I live my life. The question for you is, what kind of love do you want in yours? - Tanya, is that you? - Yeah. - I'm feeling better now. Women, no matter how human they seem, they are not. They're just shadows. But on the other hand, aren't we all? - Thank you ladies. - Thank. - Bye-bye. - Hey Knockout, how you doing Knockout? How was your day Knockout? - What happens? - Oh no, no, no. Hey, hey, give it back, everybody. - That's not the point. - Okay. - You have to be rich right? - Everything is away in the end. Love normally goes away in the middle. - Love is a thing with feathers. - What the fuck is that supposed to mean?

Yeah, great, thank you honey, no problem. I love you too. Beth, Debbie, get ready. - Once again the notorious train track ripper has murdered a young woman using these very tracks as his weapon. Police are baffled. He appears to be a master in the binding art of Kinbaku and continues to post videos of his grisly murders online, Still leaving law enforcement with no leads to his whereabouts or identity. I'm saying he, but technically investigators don't know if this is one man or a group. Some think it could be a cult with computer hackers and Kinbaku masters involved. The most recent victim has been identified as Mandy Ericson, a 21 year old female escort. Police believe she was probably picked up off the street in the Temple District. - She just said Mandy Ericson? My God, I saw her get into his car. - You saw The Ripper? - Fuck, Mandy's dead. - Did you get a good look on him? - Mandy's dead. - Did you see him? - Yes. - Are you sure? - Yes. - Fuck, I'm gonna have to watch this shit to make sure it's Mandy. None of you girls watch this sicko's post. - It's her. - Put daddy in the house. Make him as big as any birds, tiny as a dot. Put daddy on the ceiling, put daddy on the floor. Turn him red, turn him purple. - What's Uncle doing to Betsy? - She can't stop having nightmares about The Ripper. So, he's making her dreams stop. - She's right to be scared. Fuck her dreams stopping mom? And let's make The Ripper's heart stop. - I recognize that fire. You have your father's eyes. - Before or after he got a bullet in each? - Hey, hey, hey, don't get glitter in the drugs or my drink. - Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, Mandy just texted me. What are you up to sweetie, hey. - What, that's mind boggling. - See. - I see, that's Mandy. - Wait a second, let me see that. - Ooh shit. - My God. - I wanna see that too. - Holy shit. - That can't be right, Mandy's dead. - Give it back, hey. - Hey, hey, - I wanna see it. - Also they're posting pictures, see? - Yeah, this is Mandy. - It's Mandy. - No really? - She just texted me too. She's saying she wants to hang out. She wants me to come meet her at Club Waterfall, but I mean it's not really Mandy, is it? - It can't be. - Well I guess those videos of the murders could be digital effect or something. - Isn't everything a digital effect these days? - Do you guys believe in God? - Of course, what are you talking about? - And the devil? She wants me to meet her at Club Waterfall tonight, on the dance floor, just to the left of the waterfall at nine. Well, maybe it really is Mandy. Maybe she's not dead. Maybe she's trapped somewhere and needs our help. - I can sneak into Club Waterfall and check. It's crowded, nobody will see me. - Hello? - Hey. - Hey. - I haven't eaten since Mandy died. I've just been drinking whiskey and coffee and now I'm doing whippits. - You can't just stoop eating. - I don't care anymore. Bring me a Philly cheesesteak with no steak. - A Philly cheesesteak with no steak? What kind of sandwich is that? But I'll have one delivered to the studio for you. - If I was Tanya you'd bring it yourself and you wouldn't say that it was strange. You just love her and you don't love me. - Of course I love you. If I didn't love you I wouldn't even answer the phone. I'm just hanging out here with Red Hot and Irene, getting some rest. - Well Tanya's out working, you'd rather spend time with them than me? You won't even bring me a sandwich when I haven't eaten in days because my best friend might have gotten murdered and I might be next. - Wait a minute, did you say might have gotten murdered? I know it's hard to accept. Hey look baby, I'm gonna hang up the phone and order your sandwich. - Fucking Philly cheesesteak with no steak. - That shit is fucked up. - Let's go to bed, I'm tired. - Yeah, of course. Good night. - Can you guys make a Philly cheesesteak with no steak? - I just got my Philly cheesesteak with no steak, but it's completely uncooked. - I'm sorry babe. Well I told you it was a strange order. I guess the cheesesteak people just got confused making a cheesesteak with no steak. You got to eat something. - This sandwich is cold and raw and so are you. - Dust off the love, pretty boy. Before you start growing feathers. - Sometimes I feel like Tanya and Beth are trying to rip me apart like two starving dogs. - Gaven, you just seem like you're having some attachment issues. - I know you been fucking the girls. Because you can't even get it up. - I haven't been fucking the girls. I'm just totally wasted. I'm been drinking and doing blow for days. - Really, that's almost as bad. Your sweat smells like rotting liquor. And kissing you is like doing a line of coke. - Sometimes I think about you and Blue Sky. How close were you when you were kids? - We went to the same school you know that, I just knew him. He was just a kid in my class. What did you do? You didn't stick it in the right hole. That's what it takes to turn you on. Really, we loved each other. I just wished he would die sometimes, but I heard that was normal for lovers, die. ♪ Jesus is on the mainline ♪ ♪ Tell him what you want ♪ ♪ Oh Jesus is on the mainline ♪ ♪ Tell him what you want ♪ ♪ Oh Jesus is on the mainline ♪ ♪ Tell him what you want ♪ ♪ Oh call him up ♪ ♪ And tell him what you want ♪ ♪ Oh if you want religion ♪ ♪ Tell him what you want ♪ ♪ Oh if you want religion ♪ ♪ Tell him what you want ♪ ♪ If you want religion ♪ ♪ Tell him what you want ♪ ♪ Oh call him up and tell him what you want ♪ ♪ Oh I've never been there ♪ ♪ Tell what you want ♪ ♪ Oh I've never been there ♪ ♪ Tell him what you want ♪ - The man in black, he's the train track killer. - You sure? - I'm completely sure.

You want me to go over there and fuck him up real quick and leave? - If he invites you to go in there right now and kill him. - Not so fast, let's go inside and watch him for awhile. - What's that motherfucker doing? - Erica and Mandy wants to meet us. - Wow, there you go with this Mandy stuff again. She's gone. - No, she's texting us and here's some pictures. And Erica went to meet her last night. - No, she didn't. - Yes, she did. - No she fucking didn't. - What's happening girls? You have to tell me what's going on? - Mandy never stopped posting pictures and messaging us, so Erica went to meet her last night and they're together now and they wanna meet up. - You girls are really not that fucking stupid are you? Why don't you throw yourself off the roof and see if you can fly. - Everyone chill out. Betsy, girls, sit down. We're gonna stick together, we're gonna get through this. The Ripper is a hacker, the girls are dead. He has their phones so he knows your contacts and who knows what else. So, if you girls want to stay alive, give me your phones, all of you, right now. - The smart one figures it out, too late. - You guys too. - Dirty bitch. - We all partied every day like the world was coming to an end. But I threw the parties, I was the party. None of us could stop breaking the law. Somehow everyone else ended up paying my price. - Knockout. - Hmm? - Let's build a gym in my living room. - I'm down for that, I love working out. - If you wanna workout together, just go to the gym like normal faggots. - All we really need is a few basic wench and things. - That's true, and then we can do blow and alcohol while we lift weights. Just mixing everything together feels best. - That sounds like a recipe for a heart attack. - See, I used to think it was a bad idea, mixing drugs and exercise, then I thought about it. Think about all the thousands of people in the city right now, dancing in the club, getting all sweaty, they on alcohol and God knows what else. And dancing ain't nothing but exercise. - Everyone was supposed to be here. They're not answering their phones. They probably just got high and went back to the penthouse. - Kill me, please just kill me. - It's just alcohol and ecstasy withdrawal. - Just kill me, kill me please. - You look beautiful. Drinking would help you a little bit. If you got drunk you could probably eat something. - Just kill me, kill me please, please. - I thought you wanted me to take you away. Now you just want me to kill you instead. - Just do one or the other as soon as possible. - We should leave tomorrow by sundown. - You planned it and you didn't tell me? - No, I planned it and I'm telling you. Try drinking some champagne. - There's no, there's no, is this my blood? - There's something that we can do. - Dude, you really shouldn't fuck with my bullet wound. - Sorry man, just get their phones. - Red told me to get your phone. Can you get your girl's phone too, I got shot. - Stop, aww. There's so much blood. - There. - I'm sorry I can't save her. - Fuck, just do your best to help the others, Jenny. - They killed me, the doctor just said they killed me. Did they? - Just draw it out for us. - How? - I don't care, just shoot them. - Are you serious? Like with a gun? Shoot a gun in here? - Just take the barry out and fucking step on them or something. - Yeah, that makes sense. - Can you move your left arm? - Fucking hurts doc, am I gonna die? - No bones broken, you're pretty lucky here. - Betsy and Lisa didn't get lucky. They got their whole fucking heads blown in half. - Kiss me, I'm dying. - Am I totally fucked? - Here comes the bullet. Mom tie it, you guys are hurting me. - We're not the ones who hurt you sweetie, we're just taking care of you. Now hold still. - I think you have a minor fracture. You might get it x-rayed, but there's nothing much to do but let it heal. - I can't feel my leg, I can't drink, give me some drugs. - It doesn't hurt anymore. I looked like I'll let 'em die now. - That's good, that's good. Just let it go, just let it go. - There was nothing left to let go of. There's never any reason to hold on. I guess, I'm just going to grow feathers and fly away. - Do you see God? - No. - What do you see? - I don't know, the pain. I don't see anything. It doesn't feel bad. - You're almost dead, are you already in heaven? - I don't know, I don't see anything. Kiss me again. - You must see God or something. - No, only, only shadows. Just kiss me. - Jenny. - They died young. Their lives and bodies were wasted. The blood of my girls mixed in the gutters, at least they were finally sisters. For weeks, I wished that I would fall asleep and wake up in some far away land. But of course I always woke up in my bed. - You know we are being watched by the Train Track Ripper. If you're a good pimp, The Ripper would be dead right now. - You'll be dead within 24 hours. The tax collectors and the prostitutes will get into heaven before you. You'll be lucky if you get there at all. - You basically are a prostitute and a tax collector. You always have to collect from people. And you are a man whore, a prostidude. - If someone owes me money, I go over to their house, kick down their door, punch them in the face, and take their computer and their jacket. - We're hot, we just got shot twice, put the knife away. If you're having sex with a prostitute, you become a prostitute. Because sex makes two bodies one flesh. - Did you ever fuck Blue Sky? Are you and him one body? Are you and him one flesh? - Red Hot, you're going crazy. I just knew him in grade school. I didn't have sex with anybody back then. - You know I would stab you in the leg in between the bullet points and no one would know because you are limping already. - Why are you threatening to stab me? I'm just laying here. - You don't understand why, because you're an idiot just like everybody else. But these perfect valid, scientific, fully acceptable reason to shove my knife right into your thigh and leave it there for a while. And watch you cry and bleed. - Can't you just fuck me and we go to sleep? - Of course sweetheart. - I thought you were joking! - Red Hot don't joke. - Red Hot was starting to have dreams and hallucinations. He would think that there was someone at the door when no one was there. Sometimes he would see me and other women flying over him in his sleep with feathers and flowing white robes, caressing his face and chest with out fingertips. A lot of times he would take cold showers in the middle of the night. Sometimes he would cry in the shower or even vomit. Finally it felt like we had built a palace of loneliness and lies for ourselves to live in. The only things that I felt sad about were the times my girls got hurt or killed. When that would happen I would turn to Red Hot and he would comfort me. But nothing could really make me feel better. - These are useless now aren't they? - These are first class tickets. I just switched them to a week later. It even ended up costing less. - Well maybe it cost less money, but now it could cost us our lives. Isn't all that warm now isn't it? - That's for sure. - What's gonna happen now? - We're gonna have to kill Blue Sky. I wouldn't blame you if you wanted me to help you disappear until this blows over. It's not gonna be pretty for awhile. - Ice cream used to make me throw up because it reminds me of my childhood. My dad was such a crazy drunk that he spent all his money on alcohol until one day he couldn't afford to buy me an ice cream cone. - That's nice, but-- - It wasn't nice because when his dad died he inherited enough money to drink himself to death. The first time I had sex, it might have even been with him. It was just like being fucked by a cold shadow. I just remember lying in the snow and one leg of my jeans was still on and I was grabbing the stinking muscular guy on top of me. I don't know who he was. After my dad died, my mom OD'd on methadone on Valentine's Day, so I became a ward of the state. And at some point I got sick of that shit, so I ran away, onto the streets like a stray cat. - That's intense. - I'm not going into hiding while you guys kill Blue Sky, but do you think that if you really wanted to run away with me, now would be a good time? - I just can't disappear on Red Hot, without making sure he's okay first. - Red Hot's not okay, he's going crazy. And Blue Sky's more dangerous than we thought. Will you lick the ice cream off my face? - Hey mister, mister. - I'm getting real fucking tired of your pity. And fuck your dog. - Sometimes I wish the whole city would get nuked. - Where's Knockout? - I don't know, he didn't come in today like he usually does. - Are you sure you don't want me to come with you man? - I finally found a way to move all this shit at once and I can do it tonight. - It'll really make me feel better if you waited for Knockout.

All my friends died and now you're saying that my only choice is to be with the man who killed them. - Your choice is simple, it's life or death.
