[gun shots] [music playing] You know, it's really amazing the way you can get a whole herd of wild animals into a corral made of simple plastic. Well, we only discovered that a few years ago. The animals see the plastic, they can't see through it, so they think it's a solid wall and they don't try to break through. Well, I must say you boys did a good job today. Give us a little more time Dad, we'll teach you a trick or two. [laughter] That'll be the day. [sighs] You know, I can hardly wait. Just a couple more weeks and David will be out of school, and we'll be a whole family again. Your mother's in for quite a surprise when she sees you two. That's for sure. It must have a month since I washed these jeans. [laughter] Dad? Do you really think Mom will like it out here? Well, I hope so. It sure is a long way from Vassar. [airplane flying] Wow, I didn't realize Africa was so big. Sure is big, all right. KAREN: How can a place so beautiful be so full of trouble-- full of violence and politics? [airplane flying] I just hope your father's aware of the situation. Hm. But you know how he is. All he thinks about is his research. See there, ma'am? The [inaudible] Dam. Look, David-- the dam. That's right near your father's ranch. It's 20,000 acres-- as far as we can see, all part of the Mallory Research Center. Look at those herds. Those are the ones your father's working with, and trying to save. Aren't they beautiful? Hey, it's all dry and dusty, like a desert. Oh, not where we'll be living-- there'll be green grass and trees, and maybe a little stream. Oh, David, I can't wait till we get there. [airplane flying] JAMES: Come on, boys, let's go. [airplane flying] [laughter] JAMES: Darling. [interposing voices] JAMES: And look at David, here. How you doing, son? DAVID: Great. [interposing voices] Let's take a look. We'll show you around. JAMES [VOICEOVER]: Darling. Welcome to Mallory's Ranch. Beautiful, isn't it? Ah. Now that you and David are here, it's really going to be like home. I just know you're going to love it. [music playing] Yeah, we found it almost dead. There. It's OK. [sizzling sound] Well, your heart beat's still strong, anyway. Ah, just look at this poacher's snare. I wonder how many thousands of animals die every day in Africa, from snares like this. You know, each one of these kinks must represent hours of suffering. The antiseptic first, Pete. Here you go. Now if you two boys hadn't found her, she'd have died a really lingering death, huh? OK, now some of the antibiotic cream. That's the one. And she's a pretty old girl, isn't she Steve? Yeah. No teeth. I must give her a few million unit injection there. Penicillin, OK? Well, I think that's about all we can do for her right now. Let's get her on her brisket, and see if we can get these old legs underneath her. Come on, old girl. There we go. Let's give her a lift. Hey, hold those legs. [grunts] There we go. Steady, old girl. Steady. Steady. Steady. Hold up. Hold her up. Get her feet first. Take it easy, girl. Take it easy. OK. JAMES: Come on, boys. Well, that's about all we can do for the old girl. I think she'll be OK. Maybe. If she stands still there for a while-- maybe gets her balance back. We'll just have to wait and see. Bring the medical kit, fellas. [music playing] David! David! Yes, Ma? KAREN: Will you go and tell your father that dinner's finally ready, please. DAVID: OK, Ma. [music playing] Get! Yoppy, get out of there! Now! I say now! Get out of here. Go on! Let's go, Yoppy. [music playing] Oh, Yoppy. One of these days, I'm going to get you. Get out of here! Kudu! If anybody sees you-- Out! Out. [motorcycle engine] [music playing] Dad, Mom says it's time to eat. Great, I'm starved. Really. Nothing like a little hard work to build an appetite, eh, Dave? [baboon screeching] You know, David, we could have used your help here today. Sorry, Dad. I got reading this book about printed circuits and semiconductors. You know, I could almost build a TV set if I had the parts. A lot of good it'd do me out here. You know, I'd rather hoped that you'd have been getting the feel of this place by now. Like Pete and Steve, you mean. Well, you've got to admit, they've come a long way since they left the states. Come on, Dad. How long is it going to take you to understand? I'm not like them. I mean, just take a look at this place. There's nothing here. That's where you're wrong, David. Look here. The kudu are browsing on the brush. The gemsbok and the springbok graze on the bushman grass. And these animals get all the nutrition they need, right here. Now just imagine-- if we could establish herds of these animals in the famine belts of Africa or Asia, we may be able to solve the problem of starvation that's killing millions of children. Now, wouldn't that be worth working for? I guess so-- at least for you. But not for you, eh, David? Come on, Dad. What do you want me to say? I love it here? Look, I'm really sorry to disappoint you, but I just wasn't cut out to be a cowboy. [music playing] [clattering] KAREN: Jim! Jim! [music playing] Oh, you. Yoppy! There sure isn't much for dinner tonight. I wonder why? I thought you were supposed to keep Yoppy out of trouble. Aw, it wasn't his fault. Besides, whose idea was it to have all those animals running around loose? Hey, if you haven't got enough to eat, here's something you might like. [screams] Come on, Pete, you know better than that. [ostrich screeches] [music playing] I've been here three months, and things get harder every day. I know it's not easy for you, Karen. That darn eland. He ate your best shirt-- the one I got you from Nairobi. Well, you have to admit he's got good taste. Oh, Jim. [laughter] You know, Karen, if I thought you couldn't take it, I'd give it all up. You know that. Oh, I wouldn't ask you to, Jim. I know how long you've waited to share Africa with your sons. And with you too, Karen. And you know, when this land gets to you, and it will, you'll never want to give it up. That's all right. I think I could get used to the dust, and the heat, and even the animals. [sighs] But that's not what worrying me. You know the Ogamo woman, the one who lives by the stream? She says the trouble in the north is spreading. And that the insurgent tribes have wiped out whole villages. She says that it'll be spreading here. She's afraid for her family. And I'm afraid for mine. But Karen, you have to remember it's not our quarrel. Our lives and our work will go on just the same. After all, we're working for their welfare, no matter what side they're on. Mr. Mallory, there's a call for you. Excuse me, dear. [baboon chattering] Don't try to make up with me, Yoppy. You're a bad baboon. How many times have I told you to stay out of that kitchen? You're back on the chain. [baboon chattering] Stop trying to talk me out of it. I understand, Lars. The boys and I will leave first thing in the morning. LARS [ON THE RADIO]: Thanks, Jamie. It will be nice seeing you again, and meeting your boys. Then, till tomorrow. Till tomorrow, Lars. Is it trouble? No, no. It's an old friend-- Lars Olaffson. He's got a game watch, up in Singabi. You know, he supplies preserves and national parks with wild animals. He needs some help rounding up his stock. Doesn't he have help of his own? Well, it seems that Lars' men heard the same rumor that you did-- you know, about the insurgents moving south? And they all have run off into the bush. So he's decided to truck his animals across the frontier, just to be on the safe side. I see. Karen, I can't turn him down. It's less than a day's drive away. We'll be back before you know it. Of course, Jim. I understand. JAMES: How about the supplies? We all set? Right, boss. All loaded up. Come on, Pete! Let's go. Hey, Pete. Nobody asked me if I wanted to come along. Look, Dave, we're going to be working with animals. We figured you'd just as soon pass. Hey, Dad. I'd like to come to. You sure? If you want along. OK, son. I'll get my stuff. Well, we're on our way. You OK? I'm fine. Honest. Look, if you're really worried, I can call Lars back. I'm OK. Well, don't forget-- save us some dinner tomorrow night. And remember, Tshoma and the others will watch out for you. [music playing] Greetings, Mr. Mallory. [speaking foreign language] I take [inaudible]. Well, thank you. I know she'll be grateful to have those. Tell me, how is your husband and family? My husband [inaudible] last night [inaudible] men with the guns. May he soon have a safe return, [inaudible]. Safe return to you, too, Mr. Mallory. [truck driving] There it is, boys. The new catch basin for the [inaudible] dam. It'll soon bring electricity to the whole area. [music playing] [tires spinning] [inaudible], Dad. Keep pushing, boys. [engine revving] It's no use. Now what do we do? Well, we could call the auto club, but it might take them some time to get here. Push, Tad, push. [engine revving] [baboon shouts] Dad! Push, boys! Push! [elephant roars] Wow! That was close. [elephant trumpets] [men singing] Hey. [inaudible]. [speaking foreign language] [men singing] Dad, what was that all about? Those men are [inaudible], from the north. They're fleeing from the insurgents. Who are these insurgents? What do they want? The GVN, they call themselves. As far as I understand, they're a new political party, bent on taking over the whole country. STEVE: We won't have to leave, will we? I hope not. [music playing] Well, there it is boys-- the last really wild area of Africa. 10,000 square miles of brush and grass, and scarcely a ranch or farm in the entire area. We going through there, Dad? Yep. And Olaffson's ranch is a 100 miles dead ahead. [music playing] Lars. They come. Lars. I'm glad to see you, Jamie. It has been a long time. I'd like you to meet my boys-- Steve, and Pete. Pete. David. How do you do, sir? I've heard a lot about you young fellows. It's good of you to come. STEVE: Thank you, sir. Oh, you know my assistant, Cruse. Nice of you to help us out here, Mallory. Kruse. And Kende, and [inaudible]. Pleased to know you, Mr. Mallory. [speaking foreign language] Jamie. These three hands are all I have left. 17 good men left me because of this bloody madness. I have taken all I can, Jamie. I'm sorry to hear that, Lars. Sure there's no other way? You know me, Jamie. I love Africa. I lived here for 40 years. I bred herds that could fill up the empty spaces of this famine-stricken continent. I never dreamt that one day I would have to leave it. And you just built yourself a new house. I know. What are you going to take with you? The best of my breeding stock. Once over the border, I'll start a new life. After all, I'm still young. OK, young man. Let's get on with it. Come on boys, we've got work to do. This is it. [inaudible]. [music playing] Here you go. Come on, Dave. Let's go. Give us a hand here. Hey, take this. Hey, wait. Man, what you doing? Help! Help! -Oh, man. Here, let me help you. Come here. [inaudible]. Here, man, let me help you out. Help him up, Pete. That's it. That's it. Dave, listen, I think you better go help Dad over there. Yeah. Dave, just go that way. What a little brat. [sighs] Why does everything have to go wrong? [music playing] Now, Pete. Go catch them. Here we go! Right there. There they go. I got 'em. That's it, Pete. Keep 'em coming. Herd them in. [music playing] NEWSCASTER [ON RADIO]: The Central Government in [inaudible] that GVN insurgents have pushed in to the eastern sector, near Sengavi. Due to the communication difficulties, no further information has reached the capital, but it is believed the casualty toll may be high. [crickets chirping] Sengavi. That's right where you're headed, Lars. I know what you are thinking, Jamie. But Kruse assures me, the best way to get to the paved road is at Umbago. Well, he may be right. But you could run into big trouble. You know, my friend, you are worried too much about me, and too little about yourself. Suppose the GVN goes for that dam near your place. Where will you be? Or your family? I appreciate your concern, but you know it's taken me half a lifetime to get this far. I'm not going to walk away from it now. It's your decision, my friend. I hope it's the right one. Well, that's it. Lars Olaffson's Noah's ark. Ironic, isn't it? What's left of my life is on that truck. I might be grateful to you, and your sons. Well, we were glad to be of help, Lars. I'd feel happier, though, if you were heading south with us. Don't worry about me, Jamie. In 24 hours time, I'll be across the border, safe and sound. [music playing] Is everything all right? [music playing] Thanks again, Jamie. Have a safe trip, Lars. Safe journey to you. Goodbye, boys. Bye-bye, Mr. Olaffson. Good luck, Mr. Olaffson. Let's go, [inaudible] [engine starts] [music playing] NEWSCASTER [ON RADIO]: Now we bring you the news. Reports continue today of terrorist activity in the eastern savannah. And in the past fortnight, all contact with the area has been lost. In the absence of reliable information, it is feared that insurgent forces are preparing to launch a concerted drive towards the south. [music playing] Missus! Mr. Mallory called you. Thank you, Tshoma. [music playing] KAREN [ON RADIO]: Hello, Jim. Thank goodness you called. Is everything all right? Everything's fine. We're on our way home, and with a little luck, we'll be there before dark. Thank God. I heard the radio report. Yes, Karen, uh, I'm afraid it's a little worse than I thought. Now that's why I want you to do exactly as I say. JAMES [ON RADIO]: You know where I keep the shotgun? Yes, I see it. Well, if anything should happen, and I don't think it will, it might be a good idea to keep it handy. [music playing] Dad! We're overheating. Wasn't it your job to fill those before we left Olaffson's? I thought you meant the drinking water, or the tank in back. We can't use that. It's all we've got left to drink. Well, we're lucky. The game department has a watering hole over here for the animals. Bring the bags, boys. Boy, Yoppy, I can't seem to do anything right. [baboon chatters] Well, we lucked out again. This place was almost dry. [grunting] Head for cover. [music playing] Go hide, Yoppy. I'll go help Dad. [baboon shouts] [music playing] Wow! Look at Dave drive! He's cutting the rhino off from Dad. [music playing] I don't believe it. David, look out! [music playing] David! [music playing] David. Are you all right? Yeah. I'm OK. [laughing] Well done, son. Come on. Let's get you out of here. STEVE: He OK, Dad? Yeah, he's OK. Man! Where'd you learn to drive like that? PETER: Yeah, that took real guts, Dave. [SHOUTING] Ow! My ankle. [baboon chattering] Ah! JAMES: Does that hurt, son? DAVID: Yeah, Dad. Is it bad? Looks like a fracture to me. Well, that should keep it steady, help to ease the pain a little. Thanks, Dad. Radiator's busted. The oil pan's gone. We're not going anywhere in this thing. Well, I'll call Tshoma and get him to bring the truck. Well, that's not going to work either-- the radio is out of commission. So we'll have to walk it. David will never make it. We could carry him-- me and Steve. No, he's got to keep that leg perfectly still. As I recall, there's a chap called Villiers that's got a ranch near here. Ah, here it is. There's a military post over here. That's right, Steve, but that's clear across the Olega Pan. Dad, you'd never make it. That's the hardest, most dangerous part of the country. Yes, it's [inaudible]. Well, if I leave now, I could be there by sundown. Maybe borrow a truck from Villiers, and get back here by dawn. Hm. How about this place? It's even closer than Villiers. Kisavu? That's probably an Ogamo village. Well, according to this, there's a clinic there. They should have a radio. We could hike there while you go to Villiers. No, you two boys have got to stay here with David. And if Villiers isn't there? Well, somebody has got to stay here. DAVID: Don't worry about me, Dad. Yoppy will keep me company. [music playing] [baboon chattering] [music playing] OK, David. There's food and water in the back. And my rifle's in front if you need it. You boys know the plan? Right. Be back here by sundown, one way or the other. OK. Good luck, then. And remember what I told you-- the worst enemies of a man alone out here are fear and exhaustion. You keep your wits about, now. You'll come through OK. Bye. David, we'll see you tonight. So long, Dad. STEVE: You know, it took a lot of courage doing what Dave did. You got to hand it to him. Come on, Pete. The sooner we get to Casavo, the sooner we're back home. Hold on. You're not scared, are you? Me, scared? You got to be kidding. Something's bothering you. I was just thinking. Here we are out here, all alone, without a gun or anything. So? What's the big deal? Nothing. [laughs] Remember when I was a kid, I used to be afraid of lions. Yeah. I thought they lived in the cellar. Right. And everybody knows all the lions are right here, in Africa. [music playing] [baboon shouts] Yoppy, I'm trying to get some sleep. Would you please be quiet? [baboon chattering] For the last time-- stop it! Now what are you up to? [music playing] Get off that roof, Yoppy! [baboon chattering] I'm running out of patience with you. [roaring] Yikes! Yoppy! Yoppy! [roaring] Here comes the whole family. [roaring] They seem like nice, friendly lions. Yoppy, think of something. The horn. That'll do it. No. That's busted, too. Go home. Please go home. You know, Dad's right. The thing about fear is, if you understand the ways of the bush, you won't have any trouble out here. It's as simple is that. Steve. Does that include the Cape Buffalo? Just stay cool. Make it think we're in control. It's not going to be easy. [music playing] PETER: Remember Dad saying that the buffaloes are the most dangerous-- Shh! Just keep walking. [music playing] [sighing] Hey, it was like they were almost afraid of us. Just like Dad says, man is not the prey. Man is the predator. [digging] [music playing] [baboon shouting] I hope this works. [horn honking] [baboon shouting] Hey, I did it! How about that, Yoppy? [music playing] There it is. [music playing] [chickens clucking] Where is everybody? I don't know. [music playing] Pete. They smashed the radio. Look at this. [music playing] We're almost to the highway. This is where we could run into trouble. Kende and I will check it out and meet you up the road. OK, but watch your step. What is it, Umbula? What's that in the road? Could be land mine. [music playing] [gun shot] [explosion] Thank you. Lars. Lars, do you read me? LARS [ON RADIO]: I read you, Kruse. [music playing] What was that explosion? LARS [ON RADIO]: A land mine on the road, Umbula spotted it in time, thank God. [music playing] I can see the highway from here. Get off that road and follow my track. Kende and I will wait for you here. [music playing] They'll be coming over this rise. Your men know what to do? [music playing] [inaudible], Kende? We are at war. We'll do what we must to win. [music playing] Umbula, I have been thinking. Isn't that strange that Kruse turned off the road, just before we reached that land mine? Yes, boss. I've been thinking the same. LARS: I'm going to find Kruse. You wait here. And if there is any sign of trouble, you drive away as fast as you can. And don't slow down until you are across the border. But boss, if you are right about Kruse, then he will kill you. All I am concerned about now is my enemies. Umbula, you are my good friend. You are in charge now. I'm sorry for what my people do. And my people, too. [music playing] [SHOUTING] No no! Lars, no! Stop him! [gun shot] [guns shooting] A strange man. He'll give up his life for his animals. I kept my part of the bargain, Now you keep yours. You can have Olaffson's ranch as agreed, but first, these supplies must be delivered to [inaudible]. I'll see to that. We'll see to the rest. [bird squawking] [music playing] [leopard growling] [music playing] [leopard roaring] [music playing] [leopard roaring] Don't worry, old girl. I won't bother you again. [music playing] You need to clip it here, Missus, like your rose. Thank you, Ngila. See these flowers? We have flowers like this in England and America. Around my house, we used to have green grass and big trees. It must be much beauty there. Very much. Not like here. This war. The killing. The killing will end, Ngila. I hope. [music playing] Villiers! Villiers! Where are you? Villiers! [music playing] Go on. Go and eat rats. The world is full of them. [music playing] Come on, Pete. Steve, are you sure this is the way we came? Sure. Remember those hills over there? No, Steve, I don't remember those hills over there. Come on. [music playing] Steve, I know we never crossed any water. One thing for sure, this stream's got to lead us to the river. So? You plan on swimming home? Pete, how many rivers are there in this part of the country? Oh. You think this will lead us to [inaudible]? That's right. If we follow the river. There's gotta be villages nearby. You gotta be kidding. Well, you could call the water taxi. [music playing] Steve. Well, it's not a water taxi, but it's the next best thing. Wait a minute. First we got to get to a radio. There's a boat here, there's gotta be a village close by. Come on. [music playing] It's Kruse. And GVN. I wonder what happened to Olaffson? I don't know. Come on. Let's get back to that boat. [music playing] Whoa! [crocodile hissing] [music playing] Let's go, men. [music playing] Top speed, man. Let's move! [music playing] Come on, men. [music playing] Come on, keep up there. Keep up. [music playing] Fire. [guns shooting] Hold your fire. They won't get far. [music playing] We lost them. Nice work, skipper. Thanks. Now let's hope we can ride this thing all the way home. [music playing] [water rushing] White water, Pete. Hang on, now. [music playing] Steve! Up ahead-- hippo. Come on. [music playing] OK, skipper, what's the plan now? Same as before. Follow the river. We'll never make it through that jungle on foot. You got a better suggestion? I'm willing to listen. First thing I have to do is check the valve. Looks OK. [baboon grunting] What's the matter, Yoppy? [baboon chattering] Afraid of the dark, huh? Well, remember, the worst enemies of a baboon out here are fear and exhaustion. Just keep your wits about you, and you'll come out OK. Right, Yoppy? Ha ha. [hyenas howling] Tshoma, what makes that awful sound? Hyenas, Missus. They have found a kill. Ew. I wish they'd stop. Mustn't worry, Missus. I'm sure your family will come soon. He should have been here by now. My whole family-- everything I care about is out there somewhere. [hyenas howling] OK, come on. Just try and get me. [hyenas howling] [music playing] Remember I told you I was scared of lions? Yeah. There's one thing I'm more scared of. And that's snakes. Come off it, Pete. A snake will only bite you if you step on it. Maybe you can see where you're stepping, but I can't. [music playing] [leopard growls] [pig snorting] [leopard growls] Glad he likes pork. Tshoma? Still nothing? No, Missus. I don't know why, but they no answer. Please keep on trying. Yes, Missus. And, Missus, you should get some sleep. Thank you, Tshoma. [music playing] Don't move. Don't move! Nice little fella. Glad he wasn't [inaudible]. [music playing] [water pouring] [baboon shouts] What is it, Yoppy? [baboon chattering] Oh no! The last of our water! Boy, are they going to give it to me when they get back. Oh, Yoppy. [music playing] Pete? [music playing] Tshoma. Something must have happened, otherwise he would have called. Is there something we can do? The police-- can't we call the police? No, Missus. There is no police. This part of the country, there is nothing. The Casima Dam. There must be someone there, someone with a radio. No, Missus. At the dam there's no one. Tshoma called, but no answer. Thank you, Tshoma. You're welcome. [music playing] [wind blowing] [music playing] You're hurt. And hungry, too, I bet. [music playing] I know why you're following me. You won't catch any game with that leg. [sighs] [music playing] OK, friend. You've got no choice, neither do I. [music playing] [lion roaring] [music playing] I'm sorry, friend. But I've got four good reasons for getting out of here alive. KRUSE: Now, watch it. Those are explosive. I keep telling you, it's explosive. VOICE ON RADIO: Zebra calling plough share, zebra calling plough share. Come in, plough share. Calling plough share. Zebra calling plough share. Come in, plough share. Plough share to zebra, come in. Plough share to zebra, come in. Report your progress, plough share. Supplies will be loaded within an hour, and ready to roll. Stand by until we contact you, plough share. Present plan is to rendezvous at Mallory Camp, from there we move on to the dam. Message received. Out. All right, keep it moving now, step lively. Don't stack it any higher than that. Tshoma-- [music playing] Tshoma? Tshoma? Wende! Ngila! [music playing] Hello? Hello. Can anybody hear me? Hello. Come in, please. Come in, please. Anybody. Please, come in. Let's hope this works, Yoppy. It's working, Yoppy! It's working! Rover One to Mallory Camp. Rover One to Mallory Camp. Do you read me, Mallory Camp? Come in, Mallory Camp. Do you read me, Mallory Camp? David. David, this is mother, come in please. DAVID [ON RADIO]: Hi, Mom. Hope you haven't been too worried, but we had an accident with a-- David? David, come in please. DAVID [ON RADIO]: Mallory Camp, come in. David. Come in, Mallory Camp. [music playing] It's no use. She's not answering. [sighs] [music playing] Spread out, men. Check the area. [music playing] Come out, whoever you are. Ngila? What are you doing here? They killed my husband. The men with the guns. And now they come here. People at camp all run away. They say murder us, kill us all. No they won't, Ngila. You come with me. Thank you, Missus. [baby cries] [music playing] This thing may not go far. Let's hope it goes far enough. All right, Yoppy? [baboon shouts] Well, here goes nothing. [engine starts] [music playing] Ah! Ah! Get him! Get him! [explosion] [birds flying] [fire crackling] [monkeys shouting] [fire crackling] [elephant trumpets] [music playing] [crickets chirping] You, out there. One step closer and I'll shoot! TSHOMA: Don't shoot, Missus. It's me-- Tshoma. Where are the others? The others, Missus, they've been afraid, and ran away. When I found out, I go after them. I look everywhere, but find no one. No one now here, but me. Now, Missus, the gun men come. I could see them by the river. All right, Tshoma. We'll be ready for them. [music playing] Missus, they are coming now. I go to the [inaudible]. Tshoma, don't go. It's all right, Missus. When I reach the [inaudible]. [music playing] [gun shot] [music playing] [shouting] [music playing] [shouting] [music playing] [explosion] Steve. This is the place we came by. Three days ago on the way to Olaffson's. Yep. We're almost home. Let's go home, man. [music playing] [SHOUTING] Ma! Ma! Ma! [music playing] Steve! Pete! [music playing] A military post. [music playing] HELICOPTER PILOT: Just over that bridge, and you're home. Jim, thank God you're safe. But where's David? We'll find him. Can I come along, Dad? OK, let's go. [helicopter flying] HELICOPTER PILOT: There was a big fire here yesterday. You can see the [inaudible]. We left the car right about there. Dad, look. [music playing] Dad! David! You all right, son? I'm OK, Dad-- thanks to those Ogamos. Good. Ready for another one. Here you go. See now? We'll have this place looking like new in no time. Yeah. She can take us home and round up all the animals. Hear that, Yoppy? We're back in business. All of us. Together. You know, I can't remember when I last saw the boys look so happy. They're no longer boys, Jim. They're men. I feel very proud of all of them. And I'm especially proud of you. You know, I can't promise, Karen, that things are going to get any easier from now on. There's still time to change your mind. My mind's made up, Jim. We've been through much too much to lose all of this. I want to be a part of it. And most of all, I want to share it with you. [music playing] Jim! [laughter] Kudu! Give back my shirt! [music playing]
