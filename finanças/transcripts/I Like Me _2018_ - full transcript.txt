It's... it's grandpa's funeral. Of course. It's hard on all of us. I'm so sorry for your loss. Oh, thank you, honey. I'm sorry you got dragged here. I don't mind, really. We always love having you around in good times or bad. I'm glad you're here, Maggie. Your father would be happy you made it... eventually. Well, he didn't know I was late. Oh. Hey! Hi. So, my condolences for your loss. Thanks. You too. So, how long do you think you'll be in town for? Oh, well, I don't know, maybe for a little while. It'll be nice to be closer to Michael and... well, you guys too. It would be really great to have you around more. Wouldn't it, Hannah? Sure. Well, if you are around long enough, you should stop by one of my bowling team's matches. I'm always telling Hannah how she should check out the fulfillment that comes with the game of bowling. It's really a life changer. Definitely. Are you guys still in that McMansion on Bishop? Yep. Thatcher, from my Aerial Silks Retreat said that real estate is a great investment. Yeah, I mean it's usually stable but... I mean there's all the work that goes into managing a property. I can't believe you. - What? - You're gonna ask for money at dad's funeral? I didn't ask for money. "Oh, you guys have such a nice house. What a great investment. All that money you don't need." If you need money, we can help. Luke. What? She's family. We haven't even seen her since our wedding. Okay, I'm gonna go. Fine. Maggie. Maggie, wait. Oh come on, don't be such a drama queen. You don't get to play Evita at the Beach Grove playhouse without being a little bit of a drama queen. Well, you've always had a talent for it. Thank you. Look, if you're gonna be in town for a while, we should get together sometime. Coffee or you could come by the house. I tried to start a garden, you could come look at it. I think that dad would have liked us to spend more time together. Yeah. Well, I guess it really doesn't matter much anymore now, does it?

How about you give me a ride to your house? Um, no ma'am. Thank you. No. Your loss. - Surprise! - What are you doing here? You said you wanted to hang out more. So, let's hang out. I... I didn't mean at 2 in the morning. I'll go get the guest room ready. No, Luke, wait. What... can't you stay at Michael's? I didn't want to bother him. So, you bother us? Well, I didn't think seeing your sister was gonna be such a bother. No, you're right. Luke, can you grab some sheets? How about that garden? It's 2:00 a.m. Come on. I thought you said you wanted to show it off. Come on. So, I planted some cherry tomatoes over there and I planted some beans too-those are over... over there somewhere. Huh? Not up to your standards? I guess I'd be more impressed if I could actually see it. All right, you should be all set. Thanks for having me crash here. Wait, group hug. Come on. Come on. - Have a good night. - Okay. Thanks. Come up into downward facing dog. Exhale. Inhale. Now raise your right leg up into three legged downward facing dog. Exhale. And bend your right knee into your chest. And... - What is that? - Set your foot down between your... It's yoga. It's relaxing. Inhale. Your legs are shaking. That can't possibly be relaxing. and spread your arms into warrior... I'm building up my strength, okay? Hey, any chance you want to build up some breakfast? I already had lunch. Yeah? Well, I had a late night. I know. Eh... - You want a pop-tart? - Mm-Hm. Thanks for breakfast. - Got any plans today? - My mom's coming over. Why? I don't want her to be alone. Okay, that sounds lame. I mean Luke wants to take me to disco bowling alley but I'm not really up for it yet. - Disco bowling? - Yeah, it's the new big thing at least around here. Sounds better than your mom. Oh, I don't know. We're gonna open up a bottle of wine and work on a puzzle of the Sagrada Familia. Oh geez, you are still such a wet blanket. Hey guys. - You sleep okay, Maggie? - Oh yeah. I feel much better. Hey, got any big plans today? Yeah, Hannah's mom is coming over. We're putting together Notre Dame. Sagrada Familia. Right, Sagrada Familia. You're welcome to join. Oh, wow. You know, as much as I love puzzles, I think I'm gonna pass. All right. Your loss. Oh, hey. What are you up to? Oh, just checking in on the puzzle party. Seems festive. Are you sure you don't want to join? I'm glad to see you, Maggie. I want you to know that I'm here for you. Wow, that's really nice of you May, but I think I'm gonna be all right. Your father would be so happy to see us all together putting together a puzzle. You haven't even opened the box. I was speaking about it in a more family spirit kind of way. Oh, I'm not sure dad would want me in his spirit group. Well, he may not have always approved of your choices but he still loved you. Yeah. Well, I guess he came around once he got a do-over with Hannah. What? Come on, with you he got what he wanted. Good school, good job, cookie-cutter house with the cookie-cutter husband to match. I mean it really didn't matter what I did. That's not fair. Well, I'm sorry for opening up my cookie-cutter home to you. I'm sure she didn't mean it as an insult. Of course she did. She just walks around saying whatever the hell she wants. Should we get this puzzle started? It was just a joke. Geez. What's with all the drama? You are such suburbanite. Just show some respect for my family and my home. That's all I ask. All right. - Who's ready for a drink? - Sure, why not. No. The last thing anyone needs are drinks. I think I should go. Mom, you don't have to go. That's okay. - Why don't we all go down to the disco bowling alley? - Yes. I think I'll call it a night. If you need anything, please call. Oh. Same with you. Love you. Bye, mom. Thanks. Uh-oh, naturally this is my fault. No one said that. Sad women and disco bowling don't mix. We are all sad. I feel fine. Then I don't know what the hell is wrong with you. Welcome to disco bowling. Whoo! Yes! Yeah. Yeah. Come here. All right. Loser. Come one honey, you got this. Just bowl it. You can't root for him. We're all playing against each other. He's my husband. I can be supportive. Why be supportive of someone who doesn't have your best interest at heart? It's just bowling. For now. But just wait till he has to go on a work cruise with Melissa and it's all about business but you know what's really going on. I don't really think that's applicable in this situation. Mm, just wait. It's always the perfect seeming couples that have the most skeletons in their closet. I think you've had enough. I don't think so, sister. I'm just telling you like it is. - Yes! - Way to go! Don't mess up, Hannah. We'd be all so disappointed if you messed up. I'm being supportive. I want you to knock down all of the pins. I want you to knock down all the pins and then marry the best pin and then have perfect little pin babies. Stop it, Maggie. Stop it. Oh, looks like she's not so perfect after all, ladies and gentlemen. It's just bowling. For now. You think you could do better. No shit. Excuse me, just a second. - Yeah. - We're gonna need to borrow your lane. Sure. Relax, Rosy Lee. Thank you. What are you doing? This is a bowling duel. You and me. Get in your lane. Guys, guys, guys, guys. Come on guys! This is a disgrace to the beautiful game of bowling. Yes, I win! You're a loser. I'm not a loser. You're a loser. You just lost, dude. You're a loser. Let's get out of here. Michael, where are you going? Wait. What... - What are you doing here? - Luke invited us. Then why are you leaving? I'm sick of being embarrassed by my mom, okay. We're both adults. It shouldn't happen anymore. It was just some friendly competition, that's all. You were making a scene. What? Come on, don't leave. What is that? What... - What is that? - I'm sorry, what? That ring. What's that ring? Oh, um, we're engaged. - And you didn't tell me? - It's a private thing. It just happened. - When? - A couple weeks ago. A couple weeks ago? I don't believe this. Mom, I'm sorry, but we just wanted to keep it quiet, especially with, you know, granddad being sick and all. You're not supposed to not tell your mother. I'm supposed to know. I know, I'm sorry but now you know. Hey, can I come in? I... I just wanted to say I'm sorry about what happened with Michael. Did you know he was engaged? I know things are tough but you can still fix things with him. - What the hell do you know about that? - Excuse me? You don't know what it's like to be a mother, how hard it is. And you do? Yes, of course I do. You were never a mother to him. A mother needs to be around. They need to be an adult. Now I'm supposed to take advice from my little sister about being an adult? I was married before you were even born. - And how'd that go? - Oh-oh. I have a life, a husband, a career. Right, office work, such a career. I'll have you know, I'm up for a big promotion at my office job. Wooptido. You don't even know what I do. You've never asked. You only care about yourself. Right, I only care about myself and making you miserable. You're making yourself miserable. This train wreck act is getting a little stale. That's so profound. Do you want to publish those thoughts? I can't keep feeling sorry for you. Sorry for me? No. I should feel sorry for you. That boring job and your boring life. I can do what I want. I answer to no one. You know what? You're right, you seem to have it all figured out. I should kick her out. - She is difficult. - And disrespectful. But she's family. I wish my dad were here. Maybe he could help. Your dad couldn't help her even when he was alive. She was his wild child. And you were his perfect princess. Right, perfect. Maybe staying with us will ground her. Some of the perfect might rub off on her. Yeah. Maybe she'll grow up. Who is that? That's some crazy old lady. Oh, that's bad ass. I'm gonna go dance with her. - No, you fucking won't. - Yes. Well, what are you waiting for? Can you come with that guy? Cannot even believe him, he is such a tool. You dance pretty good. - What? - I said you dance pretty good. It's pretty well. And you dance pretty mediocre. Oh... Oh. Oh, you've got to be shitting me. What are you doing? Going through your Playgirl stash. Get out. Sorry. I used positive visualization to get in here and I promise to be more careful with my powers next time. Get out. Now. Okay. Jeez. I could write better bullshit than these idiots. You're right. ...safe zone. It's a safe zone. And everyone there is safe. No, no, no. And done. Top that, Hannah. They make me feel sentimental but do they bring me joy. I think the question is whether or not we would use them. And the answer is definitely not. But they might bring me joy. - Is that that Chinese woman again? - Japanese. We have really huge houses in America. So, if you want to keep them, we can find room. That's true. It might be too soon to thank them for their service and send them on their way. - Well, that's not bringing you pleasure, is it? - I'm not sure. I need a break. Hey, Hannah, come here. - What? - You've gotta see this. I know you guys usually come here to watch me and my friends play video games but today I really need to bring your attention to something. - And where did you find this? - Oh, this dude kills the Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare. Just hold on. Now, I'm not much of a reader but you guys, I just read a book that changed my life. Hello. We're in the kitchen. I Like Me by Doctor Margaret Schultz. Holy shit. Now I know what you guys are thinking. Max, you have thousands of subscribers, why would you need a self-help book? What are you guys watching? - Why don't you tell us? - The truth is sometimes I just didn't know what direction I wanted to go in, you know. It felt like other people were constantly telling me what I should be doing, like society or my mom. - I don't get it. - But what did I really want? Doctor Margaret Schultz helped me figure that out. Is this video about me? You see, Doctor Schultz reminded me that what really matters in my life is me. I mean, it's my life and this stuff I do, I'm the one doing it. My life need a more positive in me and the power to say "I like me" and I am great. I needed to take control of my life. And you need to take control of yours. Don't listen to anyone besides yourself. But also listen to me. Definitely read I Like Me. - How did this happen? Do you know him? - So, that's your book? Well, who else could possibly be Doctor Margaret Schultz? You're not even Doctor Margaret Schultz. - Am I famous? - It has two hundred thousand views. - Oh my God! - So, you wrote a book? Yeah! But I didn't think anyone would read it. I mean, really shouldn't have underestimated the power of people's stupidity. Let me see here. You were my inspiration. They love me. You should read it. Doctor Margaret Schultz got her PhD in Social Psychology from the University of the Pacific Rim. I was very affected by that movie. It taught me a lot about the human psyche. I can't believe it. Wow. You believed all the other garbage. Maybe you should try some "positive in me" in your life. Wha... Okay. "Dear Doctor Schultz, I am writing in the hope you can help me. I recently discovered my wife was having an affair with our dog walker. I don't know what to do. She is the love of my life. I don't want to lose her although she says the dog walker is very well hung and great with our Shih Tzu. So..." Okay. Whoo. "It's not cheating if there's money involved." Okay. "We would love to have you as a guest to talk about your inspirational new book." I have to find a new outfit. Yes. Congratulations. Thank you. The trick is to believe in yourself. You know, I think you can use my book. - Good morning. - Hi. Okay, not so fast. Just breathe. I am key to the door of success. Hello, Hannah. How are you today? Oh, I... I was just heading to the copier. Is that all? Yes. Well, no. I... I thought while I was on my way to the copier I would stop in and ask if you had received my application for the account director position. I think all those applications are still down at HR. Oh, okay. Do you know when you'll be reviewing them? After HR screen them. Maybe in a week. And I'll get through the screen, right? Because I already work here. Sure. But I'll get through the screen, right? I mean inside hires are cheaper. We're looking for the best candidates, not the cheapest. Am I the best? That's really up to Dana. She handles most of the recruiting. Well, I do recruiting but Cheryl does the hiring. Account Director. Account Director. Yes, it's a very important position. They oversee the handling of accounts. Like accounting? No, like companies we do PR work for. I think my assistant Finn is handling that one. Great. At this point in the process we're just running candidates through Fonterra. And where does she sit? Fonterra Recruitment Pro. It's a computer program that screens candidates. Oh. So, would they even use that for applicants from within the company? How else would we know if they're qualified? I'm gonna need the living room. What? I need the living room. It's the... the living room. Just enter it. Yes, ma'am. Luke, I thought you left already. So... What are you doing up before noon? Very funny, little sister. I'm sorry, she'll be out of our way in just a second and then we can begin. Oh wait. Yes, I packed you breakfast. Remember what I always say? A healthy breakfast is the start of a positive day. - You... - I get it. Of course. Thank you. It was nice to meet you. Okay. So, your son boinked your neighbor's wife, right? What? No. I boinked... I mean I slept with the neighbor's wife. Wow. For a second there I thought we had a classic Mrs. Robinson situation on our hands. A what? You know, from The Graduate. Well, how did you know her name was Robinson? I have that sense. It's what I do. You've gotta be kidding me. - Hey, someone left this book in my office? - Yep. That was me. And you, you gotta read it. It literally changed my life. - Oh it did, did it? - Oh yeah. This Doctor Schultz is a genius. It's like she can read my mind. To be honest, I think it can help you with the promotion. Well, thank you. You're welcome. You know that's my sister. - No way. - Oh yeah. well, my half-sister. Oh my God. Are you guys close? You could say that. Wow. I mean, when you see her, you tell her that she has a fan in me. I'll have plenty of opportunities. She lives in my guest room. - Hey, I'm gonna get some coffee. Do you want any? - No. Okay. Relax. Just relax. Happy place. Happy place. Happy place. No. Screw it. Sad place. I feel really good about the progress that we made today. That'll be hundred dollars. - You brought cash, right? - Well, of course. Of course. - Bless you. - Oh, bless you. So, what... what will you be having, sweetheart? Oh. I don't know. You don't know? If you're gonna sit here, I think you should drink here. - Beer. - Beer. Could you be a bit more specific? No. Wine. - Wine. - Definitely wine. Definitely wine. - Red. - Red. - And cheap. - Cheap red wine. We got that. Here you go. Hannah. Yeah! Not you. Hannah. She's not back from work yet. What's up? I sold five hundred thousand copies of my book. - Is that good? - Yeah, I think so. I mean it's just a book but I mean that's pretty much everyone that still reads, right? Yeah, I guess so. You want to play Call of Duty? You know what? Yes. Yes, I do. Okay. So, left joystick move, right joystick orientation, hold down the left trigger to aim and then right trigger is shoot. Okay? And go. - What? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Do I have to push any of these pretty buttons over here? Don't worry about those. Only if you need to jump. Shoot him. Shoot. Shoot that guy right there. Right there. Terrorist. Terrorist. Shoot. Shoot. Shoot the terrorist. That's a terrorist. That is a terrorist. Shoot him. Oh. Hey. Maggie just sold five hundred thousand copies of her book. Isn't that amazing? Yes, it's wonderful. What's her problem? Must have had a hard day. She'll be fine. - Okay, go. - Oh, wait. Go, go, go, go, go. Terrorist. My God. Welcome back to "Hello Hello." And let's give a hello, hello, hello to our guest, life coach and hit author Doctor Margaret Schultz. Thank you for having me, Rita. Let's start off with a burning question everyone is dying to know. What is your morning beauty routine? Oh, well, that's a very interesting question. I would say yoga, avocado facial mask and grapefruit. That's great. That's great. I am quite the yogini myself. Namaste. Namastadi indeed. Now this book, full disclosure, I am a journalist and all, I've not finished it yet, but there's so much buzz around it. Why is that? I think I'm getting at something that's really bothering a lot of people. With so many people in the world, we're forgetting about ourselves. Too true. I was having this problem myself and then I realized that all I had to do was look deep inside myself and realize that I like me... And find out why. And this book is helping people find out that why. Wow. That is so inspirational. Do you have any advice for any young aspiring writers out there who may be watching today and saying to themselves, "How can I be like her?" Well, yes I do. Follow the advice in my book and live your dreams. No one is stopping you but you. We are all great. Just look inside you and realize how much you love yourself and spread that love into the world. I like me and I am great and so can you. Well, that's all the time we have today. It's been a pleasure. I Like Me by Doctor Margaret Schultz available online. I urge you all to get your copy today. Thanks for tonight. I needed this. Thank you. Dinner would not have been as nice alone. How would I have eaten all that cheese by myself? You're such a goofball. I love you. I love you too. What is going on? Maggie! It's still! Run! Yo, Doctor Schultz is the shit at beer bong, man. Great. Can you please get all of these people out of my house? Oh, lighten up. My book sold five hundred thousand copies. We're celebrating. Whoo! Five hundred thousand books! Books! Books! Books! Books! Books! Luke! They're already here, right? We might as well have fun. God damn it. Are all you people insane? Maggie! Maggie! Maggie! Maggie! Maggie! Maggie! Hey, you leaving already? We... we need more booze. I'll pay if you give me a lift somewhere. Okay. Yep. I'm... I'm... I'm really glad we finally got some time alone. I really... I really like you. You what? Um... I... I really like you. Okay. So, do you think you could just keep pushing? Yeah. - Thanks. - But... but I... I like you. Hey, Michael. Michael! Can I help you? Can you tell Michael mom is here? Michael's not here. Did he move? No. He's on his honeymoon. You're his mom? Yes. I'm pretty confident of the maternity. Then how come I didn't see you at the wedding? I can clean this. Really? You can clean it up? You knew about Michael, didn't you? Just leave everything to Hannah, she'll take care of everything? Listen to me. What? You knew he got married? Yeah. We knew. Luke, can you just give us a minute? All right. They told us about the wedding. it was small. - They didn't want a big thing. - How could you do that? I didn't want to get in the middle of a private issue. You didn't want to get in the middle? You're supposed to be my sister. And you're supposed to be his mother. - Again, what does that mean? - You know exactly what I mean. Oh, fuck this. Maggie, where are you going? Come on. Ma'am, are you alright? Yes. I'm great. Well, do you mind getting out? You're in the middle of my birthday party. Oh. Okay. - What are you doing here? - I need to talk to you. - Do you want something to drink or anything? - Nope. Why don't you have a seat? Is everything alright? Yes. Why wouldn't everything be alright? Okay. You were at Michael's wedding. Yes, I was. Of course you were. You don't look right. You know, he thinks you're the good guy and I'm this super villain. But he has no idea. Are you still at Hannah's? Yes, but not because I have to be. In case you didn't know, I am a best-selling author now. Right. - Well, aren't you gonna congratulate me? - Congratulations. Yep. Doctor Schultz. I think you should get some rest. Well, I'm glad that's what you think. You know, I used to be his favorite. I was the fun one. You were always this fuddy-duddy rule follower. Well, if a fuddy-duddy rule follower means that I was around for my son, I'm okay with that. I was around. You were gone for months at a time... traveling theater troupes, silent retreats, poetic explorations, the circus. Never the circus. And he could have come with me. He had school. I could have homeschooled. Look, what's done is done. He turned out great. He hates me. He doesn't hate you. He cares about you. We all care about you. He's just trying to figure out how to fit you into his life. That's all. Ugh. - Yes? - Oh my God, you're Doctor Schultz. Yes, I... I am. You changed my life. I never realized how great I could be until I read your book. Oh, that makes me really happy. I've read it so many times. I wish I had your book with me so I could get you to sign it. Oh, that would have been great, wouldn't it have? Hi sweetie. Sign me! Excuse me? I want your mark on me forever. You know, the permanent and permanent marker really doesn't meant... okay, okay. Okay. Oh. Thank you. And bless your soul. Bless you too. "When all else fails, look to yourself, you have all the answers." "Don't put yourself on a shelf." "Remember, I like me and I am great." God. I'm a fucking genius. So, the whole thing kind of blew up in my face. But what am I supposed to do when my nephew tells me not to tell his mom about his wedding? What sort of positive outcome could I visualize in that situation? But... but she's still living with you? She seems quite committed to the idea. I don't think I've ever seen her have such strong follow through on something before. Well, she also started a self-help movement. Yeah. Hannah, could I please see you in my office? Yes, of course. All right. I wanted you to be the first to know that you didn't get the job. Did... didn't... didn't get the job? Did not. I'm very sorry. But why? I... I... I've been here five years, I'm a leader, I'm... I'm qualified. That's all true but there was someone more qualified. - Who? An outside hire? - Jermaine. - Jermaine? - Yes. I'm very sorry about this. But I really look forward to seeing all the great work you continue to do in your current capacity. Now if you could please leave. Congratulations. Thank you. Hey, I'm pretty sure it was close. Close doesn't cut it. Look, I know you may not be her biggest fan but to be honest, I feel like you should read your sister's book. I don't think I would have gotten the job without it. Maybe it can help you. Un-fucking-believable. I like me and I am great. I like me and I am great. I like me and I am great. Step two, jogging. Hi. Want to join me? Doing what? Jogging. - You jog? - Of course. It's in my book. Healthy living and eating clean. - What does eating clean mean? - Wash your hands? Hey, how was work? I didn't get the promotion. My bowling team didn't make the playoffs. - What? - Well, technically we were disqualified because as it turns out Ronnie was taking performance-enhancing drugs. But it's like should we all get punished because of Ronnie's Napoleon complex? Luke, what about my thing? What thing? Oh, yeah, that really sucks. But you're young. You still have time to work your way up. Yeah, but it's still really disappointing. I wanted to move on to something new. Yeah. For sure. I'm gonna go to bed. - You want to get something to eat? - No. Your best is you. Not you encumbered by other people or them but just pure you. When you are in a tough situation, ask yourself What would you do in this situation if you were on a deserted island with just yourself and that situation? Ten minutes. Nice. You will be in full control of your "positive in me". Nope. Nope. ♪ Do you feel the coldness In your stomach turn to warmth ♪ ♪ And you run of out of tears ♪ ♪ Well I saw you Around the spinning car ♪ ♪ It makes me feel miserable ♪ ♪ So is the feeling ♪ - Yeah! - Yeah, right! ♪ It's not the way You want it to be ♪ ♪ Baby ♪ Oh.

Ups and downs. You should come to one of my meetings. Think about it. It's not as bad as it seems. Jesus Christ. Welcome. Everyone, welcome Hannah. Welcome, Hannah. Thanks. Why don't you come in and have a seat? Now, why don't you tell us what's causing you anxiety today? Well, um, my dad died recently and I was passed over for this promotion at work and I feel a little unappreciated at home. Could it be that you don't appreciate yourself enough? Mmm. No, I don't think that's it. It sounds to me like you're not thinking about what makes you great. And that's what's leading to these struggles. Hannah, repeat after me. Please make eye contact with me. I like me and I am great. I like me and I am great. Okay. Well, I didn't really believe that. Should we show her how it's done, everyone? I like me and I am great. I like me and I am great. Again. I like me and I am great. One more time. I like me and I am great. Keep it going. I like me and I am great. I like me and I am great! I like me and I am great! Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up! Hannah, we try to only use positive words in this environment. Oh, shove it up your ass, Maggie. Now, I know you're upset. Why don't we try and rephrase that in a more positive manner? You're all so full of shit. I mean, you all look up to her and worship her. You know why? Because you're all worthless. You... you haven't accomplished shit in your lives and now you think maybe this will work. Well guess what? That's not how life is! Why don't we just sit down and relax? No, no, no, I will not relax. You... you... you... you cannot wish or... or love anything into existence. The world is not your playground.

Hi. I'm gonna pick you up at work and take you out to dinner. Oh, whatever. I'm rich now. After the many months of working with the monks in Tibet, I found what really works is focusing on everything that is good about ourselves. Only then could you then spread that goodness out into the world. Wow. That is truly inspirational. Right? Why did you go to Tibet? Was there something you were trying to deal with? No, nothing that I was personally dealing with. It was more of a search for spiritual truth on behalf of my clients. Max, have you been studying for your geometry test on Monday? Mom, we're recording. Oh, oh, you're recording. I thought you said you were contorting - and I got a bit worried. - Mom, please. Sorry. I'll get out of your hair. Um, I was about to make some grilled cheese for lunch. - Would your friend like some? - Oh, I'd love some. Okay, I've got white or wheat bread... well, actually it's potato and wheat bread. - Is potato considered white? - Mom, we're busy. Wheat would be great. She can be so annoying sometimes. It's okay. I'm a daughter of a mother. I understand. Sometimes she would just leave, you know. Right. I mean, wouldn't it be great if she went like on a three-month she went like on a three-month poetry slam tour? What? No, it's just the saying, she couldn't actually leave. I mean, who'd make my lunch or do my laundry? Well, you could go with her, wouldn't that be exciting? What about school? What is with you people and school? I'm fifteen, I don't want to be a truant. Anyway, let's get back on topic. So, your life was perfect but you went to Tibet to help your clients? Right. Well, maybe it wasn't all about my clients. I might have needed some help from the monks too. Maybe I needed the monks to help me better myself. But I thought that the me that we are is the best me we can be. I gotta go. But what about lunch? Christ what? What is- ...what is wrong? Could I come in for a moment? Um, sure, fine. You can sit there. - Thank you. - Mm-Hm. I heard you visited dad. Yes. I know we haven't always seen eye-to-eye but I think it's important to keep him in my life. Right. Have you read my book yet? No. I've been busy, I'm sorry. Not a problem. I happen to have a copy right here. You know once you read the book, you'll see the error of your ways. The error of my ways? Not including me in your wedding. Oh, right. I wanted to talk to you about that. You see, the reason why you... You'll see in the book that it all comes down to you not liking yourself enough. And if you could admit that you like you, then you could have spread that acceptance out into the world to me and would have invited me to come. Actually, that's not the reason why. No. This whole wedding business is you expressing your "negative in me" instead of your "positive in me." It really is a common mistake with those who aren't my followers. Could you please just stop for just a second? I want to talk... But once you read the book and come to a few of my meetings, you'll realize that you were wrong all along. I mean you'll learn to like yourself and realize that you're great and I'm great too. See, this is... this is why. - Huh? - This is why I didn't invite you. Because you always make it about yourself. I don't see how this is about me at all. Well, then you need to be more self aware. I wrote the book on being self aware. I don't see how you get off saying this is about me at all. This has always been about you. Driving you to school, making you dinner, wiping your ass when you shit yourself as a baby. That's what parents are supposed to do. And then I would offer to make you and your friends grilled cheese and you wouldn't even thank me. When did that ever happen? Well, you know what? I don't care what you think. I like me and I am great. This has nothing to do with not liking you. - Hey. - Hey. What are you up to? Nothing. I've got something for you to do. I can't do anything. I'm terrible at everything. You know that's not true. What do you want from me? I want you to talk to Maggie. What? No. Why? She was just over at Michael's and he said she was really upset. That's her own damn fault. I'm not gonna let her ruin my life anymore. Oh. And how has she ruined your life? - She gave Jermaine confidence. - Mm. - She attacked me with an army of her minions. - Mmm. And she probably gave my dad cancer. That's ridiculous. Well, stress can do a lot of damage to a person. Hmm. You should talk to her. You're calm, you're kind and you're really the only person she has left now. Yeah, maybe. Hi. I'd like to see if I can sell any of these books. All right. Let me take a look. All right. Looks like this is the only one we'll take. - Really just... just the one? - Yeah. You'd be surprised how many people come in to offload their self-help books when they realize there's nothing they can do with their sad lives. Or maybe they were just so successful they didn't need them anymore. Right. That could be it. I'm like perfectly happy, so don't go waving around your generalizations at me. Okay. I'm doing so great that I know I'll never need these books again, so you can just have them all. Well, we really only want the one, ma'am. So, would that be cash or store credit? Cash. Oh, hey, you're Doctor Margret Schultz's sister, right? Yes. And... and you are? I'm a friend first and a client. It may be something more someday if she lets me. Um, okay. Is she alright? I haven't seen her in a while. Oh, I don't know, she doesn't live with me anymore. Well, next time you see her, could... could you tell her to call me? Our meetings have really been helping me get in touch with my inner self. I'll be sure to mention it. Thanks. Thank you so much. You know I can see the path, I'm just having trouble clearing out the weeds. - Sure. - Yeah. Sweet, all right. An apple pie? You think I need a fucking apple pie? You're so useless. Oh shit. What would he think? No wonder he left us. No go away, I don't want any room service. Get out of my way. It's Hannah. Can you please open the door? I'll be nice. I promise. Can you just be more like... Fine. You doing some early spring cleaning? Mom. Are you in... What happened here? Negative in me. Sorry. I found this in my desk. Yeah? What is that? What are you doing? Oh, come on. You wore at that Halloween. Would you like... Is that you? You know, you're at the mall. Had to have that even though... Yeah. I did a TV pilot a couple of years ago. Wow, that's impressive. Yeah. I mean it was never really officially picked up by a network and we had to stop halfway through because the... the main backer, well, he got arrested for racketeering. Jesus. Yeah. But I really thought it had some potential. Are you here to yell at me? No, I'm here because Luke told me to come. Great. But also because I ran into some frat bro at a bookstore and he said you're good at clearing the weeds from the past. Like yard work? No, like life advice. Oh. I don't think I'm really qualified to give anybody life advice. I'll take anything I can get at this point. Uh, girlfriend, I think I am all out of mantras. Hey, why don't you consult one of those stupid books of yours? I sold them all. Really? Well, I tried to but the bookstore didn't want most of them. But I'm definitely planning on getting rid of them soon. Do you still have them with you now? Okay. So, can I give you a bit of advice? Sure. Always aim for the biggest payoff. Is that your new mantra? Huh, I don't know. I guess it could be. Hey! Maggie? No. So, do you think I can move back in with you just for a little while? I thought you were a self-made millionaire. Well, it seems that online publishing is not the goldmine that most people think it is. Sure. I guess. Thank you. But you're gonna have to do some of the household chores. You've got to earn your keep in this sisterhood. Oh Jesus. We're not gonna have to sit in the Red Tent too? Okay, deal. Ready? Oh! I saved you a pair of sevens. Oh, thank you. Welcome. You need all the help you can in this game. The least I can do is give you a properly sized pair of shoes. That was for you. That was pretty... ♪ All my life I was waiting For someone ♪ ♪ Was waiting For someone to love ♪ ♪ Someone to love ♪ Hey, guys, I'll be back in a second. ♪ Someone to love ♪ Next one is for you. Oh! Hey, better luck next time, guys. It's not fair. You're practically a professional. - Hey, has mom come back yet? - Um, I don't think so. I think I found a clue. "Hannah, thank you for all you've done for me over the past months, namely letting me live in your home. That was very sisterly of you. And because you are my sister, I hope I can entrust you with letting everyone know that I'm off to lead a therapeutic water polo retreat in Santa Cruz." What? "After watching so much bowling, I really think I can help people sort out their problems through physical aggression. Also, if you could let my boss know, I will be absent for a while, that would be great. Hugs, Maggie." Well, what did we expect? I guess I thought she'd changed. At least she left a note, right?
