See, the thing about love is... ...it's not about how one looks or what work a person does... ...or the age, religion, caste, gender. Nothing. All that matters is how they make you feel. Come on! You got him! Sir? Sir? Yes. Sir, are you there? I've chopped the veggies like you asked me to. You sure you don't want me to cook? No, I told you that I'm cooking. Whatever you do, don't wash the dishes and incur my wrath. You don't have to tell me every day. Get going now. Yeah, right! You've broken all but three! Soon I'll have nothing to cook in. -Oh, and listen. -Yes. You don't need to come the next two days. Why? Off to your daughter's? No, I'm going for a yoga retreat in Pondicherry. Pondicherry? Are you okay? Why are you all flushed? Nothing. I'm fine. Your age is messing with your memory. Whatever. If you've got the dates wrong, call me. I'll come. I'm very sure. You may leave. But if so, let me know. Okay! -I am leaving. -Okay. And don't forget to take your pills! Okay! Hey, ho! And the good times begin I'm a lover boy waiting A rockstar singing a love ballad And woo-hoo! I now write fine poetry too Why won't I sing all night? I am a prince charming I feel the butterflies in my gut And a chorus on my lips! Hey, ho! And the good times begin I am a prince charming I feel the butterflies in my gut And a chorus on my lips! Like I said, all that matters is how they make you feel. Foolish, happy... ...and most importantly, young! YOUTH, HERE WE COME Come in. You have a lovely place. Thank you. The bag has wheels, you know. Oh! Tea? -Tea? -Yeah. -Sure. -Sit. Light or strong? Very little milk and one spoon sugar. Okay. -Here, let me. -No, no, I can do this. Superb! -Come, let's go to the balcony. -The balcony? If someone sees us, it'll spread like wildfire here! What if it does? -My daughter will kill me! Please. -Fine! Is that an antique boiler? Beautiful! -Was it hard convincing them? -Of course. They didn't want me to go. "Don't be silly, Ma. This disease is everywhere. You're especially at risk at your age... ...and Pondy's full of foreigners! Is there need for a yoga retreat now? What happens if you fall sick ma? Think about us and your grandkids, Ma!" And? So, I said "I spent 25 years raising you and your sister... ...and 20 years caring for your father. And my only joy for the last five years is yoga. And you want me to die even without that? Okay." And? He felt guilty, I guess. He let me go! What if he realizes you're here instead of the yoga retreat? Feels like the time I told my folks I'm off for an interview... ...and partied with Loyola college boys instead. What? Like you never played truant in college? I did. I just never imagined you that naughty. I pegged you for a little saint. I was naughty but I never got caught. How's the tea? Killer! Oh, my baby -I love the song! -Me too. Oh, my baby You make me go crazy Oh, my baby, I see you And my heart goes crazy So, what's the plan for our "yoga retreat"? Here's my awesome plan for our yoga retreat. Hey, wait! -Careful! Don't move! -Wait. You don't move. Sorry. This happens a lot these days. Not bad, you clean up well! When you're as clumsy as I am, you need to master this! Anyway, the plan... Go on. -Open the fridge. -Why? Open it and see for yourself. I see. A glass of wine while I cook, then over dinner... ...and another glass over a movie? Alai Payuthey is on Prime. I like it! Good job! Want to freshen up? Yes. Take any room. All have washrooms. Which one's yours? The last one... on the left. Oh, my baby You make me go crazy Oh, my baby, you make me go crazy Oh, my baby, I see you And my heart goes crazy Oh, my baby, let's sail away In this river of love Is this love? Have you lit my fire? Is the silver moon our abode? I went searching for you my baby, And found myself And when I looked for myself, I found you right there Oh, my baby You make me go crazy Oh, my baby You make me go crazy Oh, my baby, I see you And my heart goes crazy Oh, my baby, let's sail away In this river of love Wow. What? I just... haven't seen you like this before. Stop staring. You'll burn the food. With you here looking like that, who gives a damn about food? Well, I do, I don't eat burnt food. What's the alarm for? If I had really gone to Pondicherry, I would've reached now. So, I'll call my son and tell him I've reached. Lower the sound, man. -Smart! -Thanks! To good company. To good company. Thank you. -Wow! -What happened? The food is delicious! -Good job! -Thank you. What's your alarm for? The PM's speech is now. Shall we listen? Nah! In five minutes, you'll be flooded with texts saying he's amazing... ...or he's wrong. With full analysis! Told you! It's my son, Arun calling. I've had too much wine. What if I blabber the truth? Call him in the morning. Tell him that you've become old, so you got tired and nodded off. Good idea. Maybe you should answer. -Hello. -Hello. Ma! Why didn't you answer my calls? I did now, didn't I? What happened? Modi's announced a 21-day lockdown! What? -Yes, Ma! It's a lockdown! -Lockdown? -You've to leave right now, Ma! -TV? -Now? But... -Yes, no! This is serious! You're putting all of us at risk too! BREAKING NEWS The PM's announced a 21 day... -...nationwide lockdown. -What am I supposed to do now? -Wait a minute. -What's happening, Ma? -You can at least come by cab. -Oh, no! I'll ask your yoga retreat to get you a cab. -Please be packed and ready. Okay? -Disconnect the call. Yes. How did he get the yoga retreat's number? There's no yoga retreat! We made that up! What's wrong with you? Good lord. I forgot. Sorry. Right. What do we do now? Wait, so, who is he calling? New number? I'll check in FindCaller. -It says Arun. Your Arun? -Yes. How does he have my number? I told him you're the yoga retreat's head. -Smart. -Thanks. What do we do? Okay, check if Uber or Ola are available. The apps are crashing. Everyone must be panicking. Anyway we'll get one sooner or later. It's a three and a half hour drive from Pondy... ...so, he'll expect you around midnight. And if we don't get a cab? -I can't have him pick me up from here. -Okay, fine! Agreed. What do we do now? -It's him again. -Talk to him. -Hello. -Hello, yoga retreat, how may I help you? Listen, my mother Lakshmi Rajan is at your retreat. Please book a cab for her to Chennai now! -I don't care what it costs. -Calm down. We've made inquiries when the lockdown was announced. Unfortunately, cabs aren't ready to come to Chennai tonight... ...as they'll get stuck there. That's unacceptable! Where will she go? Keep calm, my friend. We've arranged for all our participants... -...to stay here during the lockdown. -What are you saying? We cook our own organic produce in our own kitchens. 100% organic! Once your mother is back home... -...she will feel good and happy. -What? And she'll get a free 21 day yogic cleanse. Let me talk to her about this. Your mother is more than happy with this arrangement. -Yes. -Oh! Stay safe. -We'll be in touch. -What? Hail Lord Shiva. Praise the Lord. Salutations to the auspicious one. -21 days! -21 days! -21 days! -21 days! 21 days! -21 days! -21 days! Oh my popsicle! Your sly peeps make my heart skip a beat Oh, my tutti frutti! Your naughty ideas turn My greys are black again The night is breezy, time is lazy And I'm here all hazy Hey, my lion cub Your words are strong and steady And my heart is racing away La di da di teddy Your glances are a li'l dirty And my cheeks are tingly My heart is longing, let's get going There's no need for words anymore Good morning, beautiful. -I need tea. -It's there somewhere. I'll make us both a cup. Perfect. Just the way I like it. Thank you. Yours looks different, like in the commercials. It's how I like it. So, you didn't like yesterday's? No, it was nice! Just different, that's all. Then teach me how you like it. We have 21 days. I'll teach you everything. Your cheeks, ruby red Tell me a whole new story now Your striking lips Sing a lullaby of love now Floating in the skies, I want to soar higher An electrifying passion, pulls me closer I become stronger when I hold your hands I melt away when I rest on your shoulders I have no words to express My heart's desire How are you, Mom? -Who was that? -There is no one around. Ecstasy, runs wild And lights a fire within Love brings us closer And so does a bit of lust Floating in the skies I want to soar higher An explosive passion, pulls me closer When I'm beside you I feel like a princess I can tell you whatever I want Not just impress When we get together Let's throw caution to the wind Why do you always leave the spoons in the dishes? Today I'll cook. You can do the dishes. No need. I'll cook. You cook every day and I end up doing the dishes. Let me cook today. If your cooking was edible, why would I sweat it? "Oh, wow, Rajiv! You cook better than a five star chef! What a wonderful cook!" All lies I see! Fine! You cook and eat yourself! -To heck with you! -There! Your answer to everything! Your answer to everything is to shout! Who's shouting? Me? Yeah, you! -Am I? -Yes! Me, shouting? What nonsense! Yes, even if you ask a 100 times... What? How many times to tell you to not put your wet towel on the bed? How many times to tell you to not put dishes in the fridge with the spoons? What's the big deal with that? But my towel on the bed is a big deal? The bed gets damp and uncomfortable. It's gross! It's my side of the bed, and I like it nice and cool when I lie down. Well, I like it when I can take a dish out and eat it straightaway. My fridge, my rules! Oh, so it's your fridge now? How sexist! What's sexist about that? It's my fridge if I've paid for it! I've not seen this face of yours these five years! I can't have the same face for five years, can I? But that's not the point! The point is, what's the big deal if I leave the spoon in the dish? The spoons keep getting knocked out and dirtying the fridge! Yuck! Then don't knock them out! You need to be careful. Look who's talking! You break everything with your clumsy hands! What? At least I keep the bed dry and hygienic and not sleep in filth like you! Then roll around in it yourself, you buffalo! -What? -You heard me! -What? -I'll say it again! -What? -I called you a buffalo! -Hello! -Hello yourself! Oh, no! Oh, no! -What? -My daughter! And her husband! Oh, no! Aren't the cops beating those who step out at this time? No idea! -What do we do? -No idea! Come here! Let's go. -Not there! This way! -You went there! Where? -Pick this. -Where are you putting the luggage? Oh, no! -What is-- -Come with me. -Is there a way out here? -Get in! In a cupboard? Are you trying to kill me? Hold this! -Oh, my God! -Hold this. What are you doing? Oh, no! Who's there? -It's me! -What the hell? She'll get suspicious if she sees two cups! Hi, Pa! Chitra and Subbu, what are you two doing here? Where's my grandson? Aunt's with him, Pa! We got you some basics. How are you? -I'm fine! -Pa! You should have called! Why take the risk? Can't we just check on you, Uncle? Are you up to something naughty here? At this age? You better pray the police don't catch you with those covid curls! -Pa! -Yes? I'll keep the toiletries in your cupboard. -Okay... wait! -What? The doctors say they must first be cleaned and sanitized. Safety first, right? Then why is a wet towel on the bed? -Which one? -It stinks! Oh... I like it when I lie down. It's nice and cool. -Pa! -Come, I'll make some tea for us. No, wait. Are you okay, Pa? It must be tough for you, all alone here... ...without mom too, must be hard. Come with us, Pa! -Oh, no! -My bags! I'll drop off more vegetables in a few days. Please don't. I'll manage. Okay! Bye! Tell Aarav his grandpa misses him! Bye! Accusing me of being naughty! Jackass! Thank God they didn't take me with them. Lord knows, I can't stand 21 days... ...with that hairy fellow and his atrocious cooking! I'm sorry. I shouldn't have put the wet towel on the bed. I shouldn't have put spoons inside the fridge. I'm sorry too. How's the tea? Perfect. Actually you cook damn well. I just hate doing the dishes. I knew it! But why should I worry about dirty dishes? Your wife's trained you well. I want to say the same about your sainted husband. -But then I'd be lying. -Hey! -Hey! -Hey! Wait! No problem. I caught it. Hey! What is it? Do you not like my tea? Or do you not like me? I don't even remember the last time someone offered me tea... ...how can I not like you? What will you tell your daughter? Seven years ago when she brought that clown Subbu home... ...and said she will only marry him, I agreed, didn't I? Why? Can't I fall in love? By the way... ...what will you tell your son? That I love you. Simple. Ma! Who is that? Pa! -Appa. -Yeah, kanna? Where is amma? I've been calling her. She's not answering. I'm on my way but I don't like it. Do I really have to go and stay with him? The agency said they would send someone, right? No, kanna. Your amma is not okay with someone unknown. And kanna, for you to drive everyday... ...to thaatha's place from ours during the lockdown... ...is not advisable. Why are you so nice? This man has never accepted you. It's been so long too. Never made an effort... Why are you thinking about all that now? He has always been nice to my daughters. Always? You mean, during our annual visits for an hour each? And that too only till we were in school. Kanna, just let it go. Have you reached? Yeah, yeah. I'll go. Not fair, Dad. Really. Akka. I bet you're doing well in California... ...with your doting husband... ...and appa and amma by your side, during this lockdown. Whereas I... I'm back here. Back at this place where it's been ages since we've visited. And it's the first time that I'm here without you. All alone. To stay with him. Our scientist. -It's going to be just the two of us. -Hi, kanna. HIM AND ME Mary, hold that. Push that pillow to the other side. Here, hold this. Careful! Turn it and pull it out. There's a certain physics to all this too. Sure, I get it. But don't irritate her with all this when she gets here. I'll try not to talk to her at all! Here, place this pillow over there. The room looks fine, right? Your face is covered with powder! -Go easy on it. -Is that so? Allow me, please. You just save your breath, okay? My little girl... ...you left me and this home bereft of music... ...when you went away. And today, your little girl, at the same age as you were… ...walks back here, to stay with me... ...bringing music back to my ears. Hi, kanna. Hello, thaatha. For some time, it's going to be just... HER AND ME This is the bathroom, kanna. This is your bed, kanna. You'll find extra bedsheets in this cupboard. The towels too. All are 100 percent cotton. And for hot water... It's summer. You might not need it. In case you do… ...the geyser switch is here, outside. Not in the bathroom. Ten minutes will do. Or, the water gets too hot. And boiling water is not good for the skin or hair. "Don't irritate her with all this when she gets here." If you need anything, let me know. Actually... if you need anything, you let me know. I mean, that's why I'm here, right? I'm going to be pretty much in this room. I'll be working the whole time on my laptop. Lots of calls too. So, just ping me, thaatha. Sorry. Just... call for me. Right-o. You have WhatsApp, kanna? I have WhatsApp. And won't you need Wi-Fi? I brought my own portable router. I wasn't sure if there would be Wi-Fi here, so... I have Wi-Fi. Anyhow, it would be nice to see you work. Maybe you could tell me what you do, sometime. Sure. Sometime. Right-o. Let me know if you get hungry. I've stocked up on a lot of eatables. Akka, thaatha is doing well. The man is fit. And he seems fine. He could have easily managed by himself! There is no need for me to be here. I know he is mom's father. That's the only reason I'm here. I haven't forgotten the stories we've heard growing up. I mean, he hates appa. He didn't even turn up at their wedding. Made amma feel so abandoned all her life. Severed ties with her completely. Never once tried making amends. When we used to visit him for Diwali... ...remember how mom and dad used to wait outside the whole time? While we brought him sweets... ...and he pretended to ask us questions about school. And only about science, at that! Not once did he invite them in. And how is it our fault that he has put himself... ...in a self-imposed exile for the last 30 years? Not our fault at all. Serves him just right. Let him be alone. I'll be damned! The old man knows how to use WhatsApp! Here, please help yourself. What about you? -I've kept some for myself. -Please eat. Dentures! This, I forget. You carry on. I'll eat this. Come in. Please come in, kanna. Yes? Is there anything you want? Could I have the Wi-Fi password? Got your cellphone? Just a second. I've shared the password with you. Oh! Okay. Thank you. Close the door. Thank you, da. The corona is spreading-- These people are not maintaining social distancing. Then they wonder how it's spreading. The Wi-Fi signal is not strong in the room. Looks like I'll have to work from here. You brought your own router, right? Some problem. It's not working. But you're in IT. Can't you fix it? What's the problem with the router, kanna? Maybe thaatha can have a look? Seriously? It has a manual, right? Okay. -Boss, everyone has network issues. -Sir… Sorry, sir. Aren't you that guy from Tirunelveli. -You came with some... -Yes, sir. ...very good recommendations. That's why you're here. Sir, I'll complete it, sir. How could you say that today? What were you doing all these days? Sorry, sir. I promise I'll complete it by Monday. It's been two weeks already! Sir… Please, sir. I beg of you, sir. -Please, sir. I beg of you, sir. -Siva, one second. Deepika and Chirag are also on this call. And they can't follow Tamil. Could we stick to English, please? I sorry, sir. I try, I do Monday, sir. -Complete work Monday, sir. -Then, why did you promise earlier? Then, why did you promise on a Wednesday? Didn't he apologize? So, why keep going on about the same thing, Mr. Manikandan? That's your name, right? Do you have to scold someone this much? Oh, Deepika and Chirag are there. So, only in English. Okay. He said sorry. I am also saying sorry on his behalf. Forgive and move on. Life is short, make it sweet. Finally, the work has to happen and be completed, isn't it? Sorry, but who is this? And why are you interrupting our call? -I'm nuclear physicist, Doctor-- -Who is this-- The boy is from Tirunelveli. My town. Poor thing. And he apologized profusely. I felt bad for him. That's why I stepped in, kanna. Sorry. Don't worry. The call is over anyway. That was beautiful. And Manikandan was being really annoying anyway. Who was that? That was your grandfather, is it? Please thank him on our behalf. That was godsent. Okay, he's calling. I'll call you back. Why the trouble, kanna? You are already swamped with a lot of work. You don't have to cook too. We'll make some other arrangements. I love to cook. I have to eat also, anyway. Sorry, kanna. I embarrassed you yesterday. It's okay. It's just that... ...it's been so long since I heard so many voices in this house. It felt like all those people were here... ...sitting in our hall... ...talking, making noise. So, I got carried away. I fixed your router. It's upstairs, in the room. It's working, I checked it. Wow, that's incredible. You know how to fix a router? Looks like it. You know, at the Atomic Research Center... ...I've only handled radioactive material... ...and some national secrets. I fiddled with this for a bit and it started working. You can peacefully work in your room now. Without any disturbance. Most importantly, without me disturbing you. Tomato, Vitamin C. What happened, kanna? The router's not working again? It works. But I like it here. That's why... Unless you want me to work in my room. No, no. Not at all. Please work from here. In fact, I enjoy the entertainment your office calls provide. Don't bother about the headphones. Please speak aloud. Animal Planet is the only channel that isn't talking about corona. Yeah, yeah. I'm connecting. The team video calls is the new Bigg Boss. Solid entertainment. So says... ...my thaatha. So, you've played Ludo? Have I played Ludo? Ha! I'm a champion. Actually, it's all about the mathematical law of averages. Apply it and keep winning. Your amma could never beat me... She really misses you. Amma... You shouldn't have cut her off. Just because she married a man you didn't approve of. Thaatha, was it because he was your lab assistant? Or because he was from a different caste? I am a scientist, my dear. Social constructs don't matter to me. Then, what happened? Why have you made him the villain? He is a good husband to her. To amma. She is happy with him. Do you know? There isn't a thing he wouldn't do for his daughters. But he didn't do everything for mine. Sorry, da. Sorry. Kanna, can I come up, da? Yes, thaatha. Come, join me for tea. -Sure. -Hold this. Have your tea, kanna. I was working with Kalam sir. I was in a good position. But, I resigned that job and came here... ...to the city. Your grandmother... God bless her soul. ...would often joke and say... ..."you stop being practical only when it comes to your daughter." My daughter. Your mother. She had an amazing voice. Like the Gods were singing through her. The voice of an angel. I would often say that. Confidently, with pride. All I ever wanted was for everyone to hear her voice. And I was right. I know. She was spectacular. I was a pioneer in my field. I've received many awards. But when your mother sang on stage... ...watching the audience applaud as she wowed them... ...I found life's purpose. I felt relevant. Do you understand? I wish I had recorded her voice. I wish I had, back then. What's your WhatsApp profile status, kanna? "A.R. Rahman. Thank you very much for being born in my lifetime. Thank you for the music. For, in it is my will to live." Right? What if someone in Rahman's life had stolen him from the world? From you. From the millions of fans that boy has. And the joy you get from his music was never to be known or heard. My dad is a good man. He loves amma. But he snuffed out my daughter's voice with his love. I know my dad. That's not him. You may know your dad. But you don't know the man she married. The family she married into. They are good people. All of them, I know. I know that a girl must eventually get married and go to her in-laws'. But why should I have to lose her voice? Why should the world lose it? Is it right to cage a koel's voice? When I lost her, I lost my will to live in the outside world. So, I locked myself up here. And I've never said that I don't want to see your mother, kanna. But... ...I believe it's your mother who can no longer face me. Sorry, kanna. I don't want to make you cry. Don't cry, dear. Please don't cry. Kanna. Sit here, kanna. The lockdown is over. They're letting us step out. I spoke to Mary. She said she will be here on Monday. It was so nice to have you around, kanna. You are a lot like your mother. And a little like you. I asked her why. She said that given a choice between my dad... ...and everything else in the world... ...she would choose my dad. Always. I don't know if she said that because it was me asking. Perhaps if you asked her, you'd get an honest answer. But it's also not fair that she let us believe... ...you didn't want to be a part of our lives. Not fair at all. Your mother... ...wants you to believe that your father is a good man. Flawless and perfect. There's nothing wrong with that. But I wonder... ...where she got that idea from. Right-o. Can I make some tea for you? Actually, I have something for you. Ready. Discovering. Pairing successful. How did you get this? Not important how. More important why. Be my messenger, kanna Take this message to my father Be my messenger, kanna Take this message to my father I tried with all my might To touch the vast sky I stretched out my branches And grew as tall as I could But didn't get uprooted Yes, I found love Even after time has dissolved Even after the distance has doubled To let him know that My affection has not wavered... ...Kanna, be my messenger Take this message to my father Kanna, be my messenger Let him know the truth Lockdown is over, thaatha. Want to step out into the world? -Wait, I'll take it for you. -No, please don't worry about it. -No, I'll take it. You talk to thaatha. -It's okay, I'll take it. -You please take care of him. -Of course. -Please take care of him. -Sure. Thank you. Thaatha's here. Dear, there are some clothes upstairs. Didn't you pack fully? I was thinking of visiting often. You don't want me to? Hey, come on! Of course, you should. Especially on Wednesdays. You see, I don't want to miss that sales team call. Okay? I know mom and dad will be back soon. But still, stay safe. I haven't said this to anyone. But today, I feel like saying it. God bless you, my dear. Thank you, thaatha. Careful. Wear a mask. Yes. Be my messenger, kanna Let him know my truth I'll be back soon. COFFEE, ANYONE? Surprise! Hey, Paapu! I didn't know that you were coming! That's the surprise! You and your childish pranks! -Hello, Dad. -Welcome, Valli. Welcome to India, sister. Shall we go, Ganapathy? How did the quarantine go? Delhi was the quarantine center for the London resident. And Cochin, for the Dubai resident. What are you saying, Dad? If my sister, Valli opens her third eye... ...people in quarantine will run and hide! What do you mean? To come home and see my parents... ...I can manage anything! Shall we go directly to the hospital or is it only tomorrow? What did you say? Mum! Visiting hours would be over by now. And there could be restrictions. Then tomorrow, is it? Let's see. Where is Ramya? Has she come? Will she come? It's been a year since Ramya and her mother spoke to each other. And to think she stays the closest, in Mumbai! How can we do this without Ramya, Dad? Don't you call her? She doesn't answer my calls. I let her be! Why is she angry with you? This is the problem with a late child. She's been spoilt silly. She lives like a gypsy! This fight with mum is unnecessary! Let her come. I'll deal with her! Mum's the queen of our house! Tamil poet! And, an orator! Mrs. Soundara Mahendran! In a few days, it's her 75th birthday! But now, she is in a hospital. Speechless, and unconscious! She is on life support. I can't bear it. Also... ...how is this possible, Dad? For two months, she has been in the ICU! Saras. What is this, Dad? What have you done? How did they discharge her? Where is her life support? Where is the ventilator? How will mum survive, Dad? I brought her home ten days back! I set an alarm at 4:00 a.m. every day to call you. You told me she had to be in the ICU for four more weeks. Why have you brought her home? Where is the nasal feeding tube? Where's the oxygen supply? I've got an oximeter. Her saturation levels are fine. The NG tube is not necessary. I haven't starved your mother. She is on PEG feeding. Mum stays with me! No more ICU. Stay here if you can show her some love. If not, please leave. I shall take care of her. Dad's being stubborn. -Not sure if he'll listen! -Tell me. Caused by brain stem hemorrhage. Two percent recovery rate in the UK. Yes. She looks pretty normal, her eyes are open. -But lacks focus. -What is it? Pontine, is it? Pontine stroke? How do you spell it? -P-O-N-- -No, what kind is it? No, it doesn't seem like that. They say it's locked-in syndrome. How could this happen suddenly? Could it be due to hypertension? Okay. Should we take a second opinion? They are all going to say the same thing. Not in front of her! Dad, I'm not raising my voice. I am not even angry. I am calm. Mum should be in the hospital, under the care of the doctors. Home remedies will not suffice. I followed your advice until now. Enough! Dad, sister and I have done our homework. Look! She has done a complete research. We have a plan in place, Dad. Darling, this is not your PhD thesis. I was there, watching her suffer! Only after coming home, I see my old Soundara. Mom won't get cured at home. Please, Dad. This is not right. What is right, what is wrong? Who is to decide? And if it were right... for whom? For you? Me? Or her? This is how I plan to take care of my wife. Help me if you can... or just let me be. SISTER VALLI It's ringing. Hi, sis! The two of us have reached. Why are you not here? Mum asked me to leave, for good! Why would I come? Mum's in a coma. I know. Locked-in syndrome. -Dad's called you numerous times. -I didn't answer. Why didn't you? He's your father. What was the need to have me at the age of 48? I was a mistake. Just an accident. Just a slip. I shouldn't have been born. Don't be melodramatic. Can you just forget it and let go? You both are at fault. You just pandered to everything mum said. It worked well for you. Not for me! Why did you quit your high paying bank job and leave to Mumbai? Because it was bloody suffocating! I would've died! But you were brilliant! By now, you would have reached the top. Yeah! This is exactly what mum said. I quit my job, she yelled at me. She humiliated me and threw me out of the house! And so, I left. I struggled like an orphan in Mumbai. Do you know that? Anyway, if mum can be this adamant... I can be too! Ramya, grow up! Well, you grew up. Just the way wished for. All tall and wise. Are you both happy in life? Sweetie, this is mum's 75th birthday! And both her favorite daughters are with her. She does not need me! Enough with the sob stories. My sister, Valli... it was you who brought me up! If you are down in a coma, let me know. I'll stay beside and nurse you. Ramya, this is not the time to misbehave. Okay, I have to go. I have a recording. Bye. Sweetie, it's okay if you don't come. At least call on mum's birthday. For dad's sake, call. Okay, bye. Bye. I've got to go. Say that you will call! Okay. Why are you in such a hurry? I've got to go. Bye. Bye. No match for your coffee! What did we name your coffee? Kalikkam, the potion. So strong! Almost poison! But the good kind! The potion that wakes everyone up. Hot and strong! Just like you! Sister? Any issues at Rahul's school? Did they call? -Did Anand pick him up after work? -Hold on! This is Madras. Not Lancaster. Come, you jet lag queen! Soundara, guess what's happening out in the world? Thanks to the lockdown, everyone is stuck at home. The dogs are rejoicing that the masters are with them. And the cats are frustrated that they're not leaving home. Both are pets. But see how different they are? Sister. My dearest Soundara! What are your thoughts on becoming a grandmother again? So many years... ...and so many disappointments. I will be late, but it will be a false alarm! So many Gravindex tests and numerous IVF trials... But now, out of the blue... Mum, it happened! I'm going to have a baby! Is this what they call a miracle? You conceived Ramya late. Right? But, isn't she the brightest star of us three? Now, wait and watch. This late comer will also be a bright one. Will you? Just the way you used to do before my science exams. Bless us both! Oh, God! I look hideous! Mum! Mum... ...can you hear me? Mum, your hand... Mom, can you hear me? Can you hear me, Mum? Your hand... Saras. What's with you? Mum's hand was there. Now it's come down here. Have you gone mad? Isn't it enough that dad has gone cuckoo, and now you? What's this on your forehead? What's with the laughter? -Why are you grinning? -Dad is here. -What? -Come. Do you realize what you're doing? You're talking to mum, just like dad. What's happened to you? Dad will now happily sit on his high horse. I love you, my grumpy sister. Hey! Stop it! Two pink lines! Positive! -Oh, my-- -Social distancing! Oh, my God! One, two, three... Let's celebrate... You gave us... ...the gift of joy and love... Let's celebrate... You gave us... ...the gift of joy and love... Let's celebrate... You gave us... ...the gift of joy and love... Oh, my child! "A street slang names an ancient Tamil literature." The first letter is "I", ends with "T". Naladiyar? Doesn't match with street slang! What could it be? What? Do you know? Inna Narpathu. See? I cracked it before you. We've been doing these crosswords together for years. A pointless job. But, we will fight over the newspaper to solve it. You would read the clues, and I'd figure out all the words. Alright. I'd figure out half of it. No? One-third? Dad, how's the pudding coming along? Sweetly, my daughter! Hey! -Don't add egg in the cake. -Oh! Mum doesn't like eggs. Okay. -Sister. -Yes. You tell him. -Me? -You're dad's pet. How do I do it? Dad... ...Saras and I have spoken to the doctor. They will send an ambulance and take her in. No. Dad, this is not right. If something happens to mum... ...the guilt will kill us. What do you want to do? Plug machines into her body? I've given her my word. She doesn't have to be treated like an object. I can't watch her suffer! Are you sure she is not suffering right now? What if she falls down? Who's responsible? We are not equipped for this. Sister... your phone. -Dad... what she's-- -Shut up! Hey, Anand! What's this, Anand? How can they do this suddenly? They're changing? I am in India now. Can't you talk? Give the phone to the head teacher. I'll talk. Yes, Ms. Parker. Surely the fact that I'm a full time mum, should help. You do have a point. But honestly it's too soon to take the decision. But ma'am... ...we don't have a choice, do we? Yes, I do. Thank you. What happened? They called from Rahul's school. He is not able to focus on anything except music and sports. He's dyslexic, Dad. They want to move him to a special school. This wouldn't have happened in this house. Mum wouldn't have let it come this far. She would have sensed it earlier. I missed it. We were both busy at work. And didn't spend enough time with Rahul. We left him with babysitters and ruined his future. Look here. I'm an older version of Rahul. My grandson has taken after me. I didn't even go to school till the fourth grade. Words made no sense. Alphabets would dance out of the page. Words would flip around. I couldn't understand a thing! My education was purely auditory. I faltered... made blunders, but somehow I learnt. What did you say it was called? -Dyslexia. -Yes, your father was dyslexic too. But they hadn't coined the term back then. Great scholars were like my grandson and me. Albert Einstein, Stephen Hawking. Don't worry my, daughter. Everything will be alright. Wait. Selfie! Mum? We'll take one more with mum. -Yes. Okay. -Why you taking so long? -Wait. -Is mum ready? Ready. Three, two... Valli... look here. Three, two, smile. Very good! Superb! What a lovely shot! I should also be optimistic like dad. Can I try talking to you? Can you hear me? I can't sleep. Can I be next to you for a while? Do you hear me? When Saras was taking the selfie... ...I thought I saw your eyes move. Were you aware of us? I need you. We all need you. Dad. Ramya is calling. I thought she wouldn't. -Ramya's on call. -Give it to me. Hello, Dad! -Ramya. -How are you, Dad? Just a minute. Dad, I've got to go. Just tell mum that I wished her. Wait! Dad. Mum. Can you see me? It's 12 o'clock, Mum. Happy birthday! You don't wish to see me, is it? Is that why you're like this? Mum, say something. Please say something. Maybe a poem? Yell at me. Tell me I caused your doom. It's been so long since I saw you. I missed you. I've missed you my whole life. But I'm in a good place now. I'm happy! You brought me up well. You would chase me around with a cane and send me to music classes. I owe you a lot. Because of you, I found my joy in life! How did you do it? You have raised all three of us into strong... ...and independent women! It's a miracle! All three of us are different versions of you. That's probably why I can't apologize. But I say it from within. Only you can't hear it. You're always with me, Mum. O my lord O wanderer Mum's hand... Sister. Did you see? Dad, mum's... Soundara My dear, Soundara Happy birthday to you It's your birthday today It's a bright day It's the day when we forget all Our worries, like children do Happy birthday to you Soundara... where are you? Dad. Dad. Dad. Dad. Is it alright? Needs more milk! -It needs-- -Does it need more milk? The aroma is so good! Whose coffee is it, after all? Mum. What's this! Coffee... Coffee, anyone? REUNION Who is it? Aunt Bhairavi? It's me, Sadhana... ...Vikram's school friend. We will rock you! You used to sing Western music! You used to drag Vikram along to school culturals. It's the same Sadhana! You have a great memory. What's with the surprise visit? My bike broke down. I'm so sorry to barge in like this. Oh, please come in. -I shouldn't have kept you waiting! -Thank you. Oh, God! I used to tell Vikram's father all the time... ...that you will go places. I haven't gone anywhere! I sing on the weekends at the Blue Lotus Hotel bar. Nice! Just trying to book a cab, Auntie. Sorry. My cab requests are getting canceled. Don't worry. Vikram will be home shortly. He will drop you home. -Sure? -Of course! Where is Vikram? Check the vitals. Yes, Ma? I saw six missed calls from you! Are you okay now? Yes, I am okay. I was cleaning up the kitchen. Why did you have to do it? You have domestic help! All of them have left fearing the lockdown. Don't worry, I'm on the way. Do you need anything? I don't need anything. Your friend is waiting for you though. Which friend? Hey, Sadhana! -Vikram! -What a pleasant surprise! Sorry, man. My bike just... Oh, come on. No problem at all! Just give me five minutes. I'll get ready. Sure. By the way... you look different. -Oh! -Suits you. And you look like a geek, as always! Wait, I'll be back. Sadhana, can I get you something to drink? No, thanks, Auntie. You said you worked at a bar. Food and drinks must be free for you, right? No, Auntie. Only snacks and soft drinks. We need to pay for other drinks. They make really good cocktails. Mojito... ...cosmopolitan. Yeah. Hello, Sister? -Doctor. -Yes. The ulna fixation patient, Jitendra Prasad-- Yeah, I wanted him to be shifted to the government hospital. Is he okay? Sir, they called from the hospital. The patient has gone into distress. They suspect it is COVID-19. What? COVID? -Hi, Sadhana. -Hey! I don't think I can come down. I just got a call. I think I may be exposed to COVID. COVID? Oh, shucks! I'm sorry to hear that, Viks. Are you okay? I think one of my patients got infected. So, all of us who came in contact with him... ...be it me, the nurses, attenders... ...we have to self-quarantine ourselves for 14 days. Oh, no! What are you saying? How are we going to manage? I'll make some arrangements. Don't worry. Just relax. Please sit down and rest, Ma. My mother falls under the high-risk category. Diabetes. Osteoarthritis. I don't know what to do. Okay. Listen, you have enough going on. Don't worry about me. You take care. I'll get home somehow. Where are you going now? Well, I have to pick up my bags, and... ...I need to catch a bus and go to my mother's place. All okay? Why all of a sudden, that too during a lockdown? It's just... ...some flatmate issues, rent... Nothing serious. My mom also felt... ...it's not safe for me to stay alone in Chennai at this time. So, just going home. -See you. -Just a thought... ...why do you have to travel on a crowded bus and risk it now? Don't do it. Why don't you... ...stay here with us? Just for a few days! Are you kidding? You are most welcome to stay with us. Are you serious? Come on. This is safer than buses and crowds. Sadhana, do you want to sleep on the bed? No, Auntie. This is just fine. Hello, Ma? I am not coming home now. I'm staying at my friend, Vikram's place. We are not alone. His mother is home too. Okay? I'll talk to you later. Good night. Auntie! I'm going to cook some awesome biryani! -Yes! -Oh! Here are the ingredients. No, no. Give it to me. Onion. And we chop. -We both have-- -Oh, careful! Be careful. It's really sharp. Is that smelling good or what? It's ready! It looks amazing. Vikram will love this. Let's give it to him? Okay! Vikram. Viks! Your food is here. Oh, I'm so famished. It smells amazing. So? How is it? The biryani? Or the chef? Superb! Hey! Your nose is bleeding. -What? -There is blood. -Are you okay? -Oh! Yeah, I'm fine. I just... I just bumped my head in the kitchen. Are you sure? Enjoy your lunch. I'm fine. Seriously. Hey... the BP apparatus is in the cupboard. Just take it. Auntie! -Shall we play some rummy? -Sure! So, did you play cards with Vikram's father? Yeah, right! His life revolved around patients, the hospital, and medical books. What about romance? It was nonexistent. He would do it almost clinically, like giving an injection. But... ...he took such good care of me for 35 years! Do you have no plans of getting married? No, Auntie. My mother asks me all the time too. What about Vikram? I heard there was a girl in college. Yes, there was this girl called Sam. But I think it wasn't too serious. -Oh! -He never introduced her to us. Now, his life is all about work, work, and work. He wants to become a better doctor than his father and grandfather. But no social life whatsoever. Neither does he have one, nor do I. Is that so? Back in school, he was quite the outgoing guy. When he used to sing with me... ...a lot of girls had a crush on him. Seriously? On him? You'll be surprised. He scored 91 percent in some exams. His father, the great Doctor Ramasami... ...belted him for missing out on the 97 percent cut-off. He stopped singing after that. Now, it's all gone. Poor Vikram! Actually, he had written some pretty terrific poetry. Oh, yeah? -You didn't know? -No! You know what? I'm going to get it for you. Sadhana, what are you doing, huh? You were supposed to give my mother company, not gossip with her. "I stared starry-eyed, At the stars in the sky." Wow! Sam must have loved it. -Nothing happened. -Oh, my god! -My stuff. -It's just your bag... -What am I going to do? -What is it? It's lockdown. I can't even get more stuff! -What is that powder? -That looks like cocaine, Ma. Drugs! -Auntie, pen! A pen! -Pen? Pen, paper, something. -What for? -Auntie. -You are awesome. -Oh, my god! Everybody... Yes, I got it. Nothing in this whole world Can make me feel the way you do Taking me up to heaven, Got me trippin' just on you Feeling my body over Just the way you like me to Doing it your way, my way, Every way that we want to Don't stop Got me addicted You know, I like it wicked! So smooth, got me hypnotized On days, oh yeah You see it in my eyes Don't stop Don't, don't, don't stop Don't stop Don't, don't, don't stop Come on, sing it with me! Don't stop Don't, don't, don't stop Don't stop! Don't, don't, don't, don't! Don't stop! Don't stop! Vikram? Yeah? She has been asleep for such a long time! Ma, please check on her. How do I do that? She seems okay. No, Ma, we need to check her blood pressure and pulse. Please, you have to do it. She is your friend. You do it! You were the one who wanted company! Vikram! Ma, please. I can't come down. At least splash some water on her face. Yeah. The pulse oximeter is in the drawer. Yes. -This thing? -That's the one. Just clip it on her finger. Auntie. 91.87. Okay. -Is that fine? -That's good. -Yes. -It's good. What happened? Don't worry. -Sorry. -You are okay. I am here for you. I'm here. Ma. What? Negative! You don't have corona. Thank God! Now, I am here for you. Sorry, I fucked up... ...in front of your mom. It's okay! But, how did you get into this? You wouldn't understand. Because my dreams were just too big for me. When we started this event management company... ...we were working 18 hours a day. I just needed the coke. It was like fuel. If I didn't have it, I would-- You are judging me. -I can see it! -No. I know what coke can do, Sadhana. Yeah, right! What do you know? It's not like you spent your rent money on coke... -...and you don't have a home to go to. -Hey! Hey, what do you mean? Do you think I have no problems? I'm sorry. It's okay. Vikram. Give me something? Just diazepam. -No, Sadhana. -Please! -Just one half! -No, I cannot change you-- I cannot switch you from one substance to another. You're killing me. Please, I need it. No, Sadhana. I know it's hard. But you have to get through this. Fuck off! You stupid nerd. Even before the corona lockdown... ...this darn arthritis had me in a semi-lockdown. Hey! Why don't you wear a sari too? Who would want to see me in a sari? I just came to help you. If you want to help me, go to Doctor Ramasami's bar. Get some rum, and make me some fresh Mojito? Really? Yeah! It's been a long time. Okay, guys. Say cheese. Very nice. One more. Seven days sober! -Cheers! -Cheers! Okay. Sadhana... ...just go easy on the booze, okay? Stop scolding her, son. Like you have never tried any of this! Who, me? What do I look like to you? -Yeah, right! -Yeah, right! No, it's the third left. It's a dead-end. It's a red brick house. You can't miss it. -Yeah. -What's going on? -I'll call you back. -Whom are you talking to? -Why are you sneaking up on me? -Who was it? It's a bloody drug dealer, right? I'm not going to answer that. Sadhana, it's a fucking chemical. It's taken control of you! Dude, are you like my savior now? You took care of me for ten days, and you think you are-- You know what? This is my life. My choice. I want it. I'm leaving. Where will you go during lockdown? I'll go somewhere. Just let me go! Sadhana, open the door. What happened? -What did you say to her? -I didn't do anything! I told her to give up her habit. Is that wrong? -Sadhana. -Sadhana, come out. He said it for your own good. He took such good care of you. No! I can't do this. I feel so useless. I am causing trouble for everyone. -Hey! -I shouldn't be here anymore. Sadhana! Sadhana, don't do anything stupid. No, please! No, please let me be. Please! Just leave me alone! I'll get the spare key. Sadhana. Just leave me alone! In a highland track On a bullock cart There goes a maiden! Why are you singing all wrong? In a highland track On a bullock cart There goes a maiden! On the branch of a mango tree In Manamadurai Perched was a parakeet which asked me Are my eyes real pretty? Are my feathers real pretty? When posed with this question What would I... ...I sing? That was superb! Your son... ...he is the real talent. We must have performed this song a hundred times on stage. And yet, he somehow strived to sing it wrong! You fraud! But it worked. Thanks, I feel better. Why do you insist? You don't trust me. Of course not! You may think you can stay away from it. But with coke, a single relapse can-- Yes, it is hard. I know. Look, I don't know what I would have done without you and auntie. Really! Despite her arthritis, she took such good care of me. Physically and emotionally... ...I really needed that support. Then, why are you leaving? Because this is my problem. I have to face it. I'm going to seek professional help. I've finally found the courage to do that. I need to visit my mother. Reconnect with music. I have a lot to do. Auntie! Hey! Your music and your laughter breathed life into this house. Can't you stay a little longer? Oh, no! Then I'll never be able to say goodbye to you and this house. Viks, you should start singing again. Auntie, ask him to practice a little every day. Yes. His father isn't around anymore. So, you can't blame him! I can't blame my father, fair enough. -But please don't ruin poetry for me. -Oh, buzz off! "I stared starry-eyed, at the stars in the sky. The stars gave me company. They shone into my eye. The stars were foolish, they knew not my mind. For I was in love with the deep blue sky." That wasn't for Sam. That was for you, Sadhana. MIRACLE Miracle! When was the last time you heard this word? With the current happenings... ...you must have given up your hope, almost! Corona is anywhere and everywhere! Will a miracle happen? Can we believe in it? Miracles happen. If you go back to your childhood... ...you might have wanted something... ...and might have cried for it. Yeah? You have got beaten up and slept it off. When you wake up the next morning... So, that's it! No way to escape, right? That is the power of miracles. A relative... ...might suddenly turn up at your house... ...and would have given what you longed for. Thus, miracles happen! Don't share this open secret with anyone. Neither will they believe you nor will they allow you to believe. Hidden this open secret within us. Whoever... finds it... ...they get all the benefits. Miracles will happen! You will see lots of wonders in life, if you believe in miracles. Miracle! Miracle! A miracle will happen now! A miracle will happen today. A miracle will happen tomorrow. Miracles happen every-- The corona count in Chennai crosses 500 cases today. All necessary precautions are being taken by the government. The government is extending its full support-- Let's all keep believing in our lives... ...that a miracle is happening. It will definitely happen. Miracle! Miracle! Hey! That guruji is getting on my nerves. Switch it off. What about you? You are listening to the COVID updates like it is a cricket scoreboard! You better shut that off and prepare lunch! Damn you! We are left with just 17 bucks. Let's hit the streets. Maybe some social worker will offer us tamarind rice. Miracles do happen. If you trust in miracles-- Listen to this. You will see lot of wonders. A miracle will happen. Believe it, bro! Tomorrow our fortune might change and shower money upon us! Don't push me! We lie here like a lazy lizard and expect money to shower? What a jerk! Bro! There is a chance of getting our hands on some heavy cash! I keep telling you but you won't heed me. What will you do if they find a cure... ...for corona tomorrow? Think about it. You're right! -Bro! -Yes, bro! A money launderer. He's got loads of black money at his office. Because of the corona situation... ...he can't stash it at his home or in his office. So, he split the cash and hid it in several old cars. And parked them across several abandoned places in the city. What? Who told you this? A friend of mine! The money launderer's business partner's close associate's friend! 100 percent true! Twice a day, a person will check on these cars. Just wait. Someone might come to check this car too. How much cash is stashed in each car? Two to five million. This is unbelievable! Someone has made a fool of you! Oh, is that so? Damn you! Let's go back to the streets for tamarind rice! Silent, bro. Someone's coming. I told you so. Idiot! You're right, bro! Bro! Tamarind rice or biryani? Only biryani! Always and forever! Bro, let's begin. Bro! Superb! Hey, bro! Open the back door. Oh, God! Not even a penny! Two to five million? You've been fooled! -Bro. -Yeah? You saw the guy checking the car earlier too, right? That moron might have come to steal the tires. -Bro. -Yeah? Why don't we steal the tires? Four tires and one spare. We can make 15 grand easily. True that! All four tires are damaged! At least the spare tire is intact! We can make three grand at least. Sorry, bro! That's fine. Let's hope for a miracle. I hope so. What happened, bro? Check this building out! Full of software companies. Let's steal a laptop. At least we can watch movies on it. Why just one? Let's steal three! One for movies and the others for sale! Oh, no! Why are you still carrying the tire? Considering our current luck, I don't want to go home empty handed. Is this a software company? Yes, bro. Now, search for the laptops. I have found the computer. Let's take it. Bro! We can't carry that home. Look for laptops. To hell with our fortune! -Bro, come here. -Yes! We found a laptop. Let's leave. Just one? You said there will be more. Enough. Let's not be greedy. Superb! Let's move fast. Why would they have sacks in a software office? Bro, come here. What happened? Sugar packets. Sugar packets? Bro, are you out of your mind? This is cocaine! -What? Are you sure? -Yes, bro. Bro! This sack is full of cash! Oh, bro! Loads of cash! Oh, yeah! This is the luckiest day of our lives, bro! Bro. Is that a ghost, bro? That is a ghost. Shut up! Let me check. Bro. Don't leave me alone, bro. Shut up and follow me. Shall we call an ambulance? Wait. Bro, he is dead. Looks like suicide! He seems to be a big gangster. Imagine the mess he must have been in! Despite having so much. Look at us! Fighting for tamarind rice and biryani. Bro. Should we forego the money and leave? Are you out of your mind, bro? Let's leave with the money. Bro! Don't pick up the cocaine sack. Okay, I'm taking only the sacks of cash! Bro, why are you carrying the tire? Evidence, bro! This is a crime scene now. This tire will be evidence, if left behind. That's smart, bro. Let's move out quickly. Bro! Bro! Bro! Bro! Bro! What happened, bro? Bro, that's a real ghost. Are you out of your mind? Let's escape before he comes to his senses. Careful. Fast. Bro. What are we going to do with all the money? We will get caught if we make any moves now. Let the pandemic end. Let the situation get back to normal. Till then, let's catch up on Mahabharatham on the laptop. -Mahabharatham! -Mahabharatham! Miracle! It is a miracle! I will finish my movie. I don't need anyone's help. I will finish my movie. Miracle! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! This laptop is not working, bro. It's stuck. Rowdy lady! I think we went to a film production office yesterday. I think the guy we saw is the director! Bro, look at this. Cocaine bags. Like the ones we saw yesterday. Remember? I thought it was original cocaine. And you said those were just sugar packets. Looks like you were right! Everything is fake! Are you stupid? So, like I said yesterday... -Guruji. -...how many of you believed in miracles? -Guruji! -How many of you experienced... -...a miracle yesterday? -Guruji! Come. What's the matter? -Guruji... -Maintain social distance! What happened? Our goods near the abandoned site is missing, guruji. How much? 15 million. Good for nothing, all of you! Dumb idiots! Get lost. Useless. Shift. Action. So, how many of you experienced the miracle yesterday? How many of you believed in my words? Did the miracle happen? -Bro? -Yeah? This tamarind rice is awesome! Corona, free tamarind rice and guruji talks. This is bliss, bro! True, bro! Bliss! Bliss it is!
