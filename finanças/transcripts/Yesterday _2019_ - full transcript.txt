Yeah, well, I try to be friendly. Unlike me. I'm increasingly finding I don't like you. - Right. - You know, the beard gets on my nerves. What's wrong with shaving? - Yeah, I know. I suppose I... - Yeah... And I don't like the way you're always late. I-I don't like the way you dress.

I'm gonna have to say good news, 'cause I don't think I could take any more bad news. Well, the good news is you're booked for Latitude Festival. No! (laughing): Yes! Yes! It's not the biggest...

So everyone who said that you were a lazy, - useless, drug-taking drunk... - Hello. ...who'd never get a job were wrong. Yes, they were, actually. I'm in profitable employment. A valued cog in a well-oiled rock machine. - Yeah. - Yeah. Good set, though, mate. - Yeah. - Did you hear it? I didn't see you. I-If I'm totally honest, I only popped by for a quick bong behind the tent. - Oh. - But it was a lovely surprise to hear you. I mean, I didn't hear much of it, to be honest, 'cause... of the bong and stuff, but... yeah. Ah, you're still making sweet love to young Ellie, I see. - No. - (laughs): No. No, never. Not once. That's a shame. She's my manager. Hey, do you wanna come backstage for our gig? - Wha... Please. - Yeah? - Let's do it, then. - (laughs) - Let's rock this road. - All right. JACK: So how long you been back in Suffolk? Oof. Well, I'm trying to live outside the traditional concept of time. So, could be weeks, could me months, could be a year and a half, no idea. Oh, here we are. - (cheering) - Thank you so much. JACK: So what exactly do you do? Make sure everything runs like clockwork. - Service the equipment. - Right. Make sandwiches, make teas. Uh... Oh, Christ. (mutters) Sorry. Sorry. Sorry, Michael. You're fired. Fair do's. (crowd cheers) Got fired. Give Ellie one for me, yeah? - No, really, we don't... - Catch you later. (Michael vocalizing over speaker) ELLIE: Oh, great day. JACK: Yeah, great day. Though, Elle, we should stop now. I can't do this anymore. (scoffs) Don't be stupid. You're gonna need a bigger tent. (American accent): You're gonna need a bigger tent. No, okay, stop. You gotta stop pretending that we're in a thrilling story with a big, exciting end. We're in a little story and it ends now. I think I hear something special in my songs, you think you hear something special, and I love you for it. But no one else does. No one ever has. Uh, Nick loves "The Summer Song." Nick is famously a world-class moron. If it hasn't happened by now, it's not going to. It'll take a miracle. Miracles happen. I mean it. This is a serious moment for me. This is just absolutely not happening. Look, I can't be the star that we thought I could be at 14, on that day in the school hall when I sang a pretty cool cover of "Wonderwall" and you were there, backstage. - I'm not hearing a word. - Okay, but look. This, this was my last gig. And I'm so happy you were there. This is the end of our long and winding road. ELLIE: Come on! The world is full of miracles. JACK: Like what? Benedict Cumberbatch becoming a sex symbol. - Oh... - You'll change your mind. I won't. This is the start of a better life. And I'm... feeling perky about it. JACK: Mmm. Night-night, rock star. Yeah.

You were just unlucky that at that exact moment, a big bus hit you. You know, the weird thing they thought was gonna happen at midnight when we hit 2000? - Oh, yeah, Y2K. - It sort of happened. It was very big news which, um, you missed entirely. - Because of the bus. - Ah. Mm-hmm. (chuckles) Right. I've gotta get back to school. - Elle? - Yeah? Thanks for taking such good care of me. You're welcome. I'll come back later. Will you still need me, will you still feed me, when I'm 64? (laughs): I don't know. I'll think about it. - Why 64? - What do you mean? It's just... oh, forget it. (chuckles) What do you mean, "Why 64?" (sighs) ELLIE: I think the accident was a message from God. - (scoffs) - Yeah, he was very angry. Elle, you think me getting hit by a bus was God's way of telling me not to go back to teaching? (laughs): Exactly. (squeals) Incredible. It's amazing. You know, God loves your stuff. Look, if God had been remotely interested in my stuff, he would've once, right, just once, had someone write me a fan letter who wasn't my mum. (snickers) Or me. - (laughs) - Yeah.

'Cause I thought we were going to Russia, so I should write a song about Russia. Yeah, that... I just, I thought it was really cool that you called it "USSR," you know? It probably stopped being called that before you were born. Yeah. MAN: Amazing, man. - Loved that USSR track. - (chuckling): Thanks. Right. I've got an idea. Everyone, I think we can all agree that we're impressed with Jack's songwriting talent, right? - Whoo-hoo! - (cheering) - So, here's the plan.

Okay, here's the plan. We're gonna take the five best songs, we'll put them online, right? No visuals, just the music. The enigma of Jack Malik.

It's, uh, (chuckles) a lot of words, Jack. But ultimately, in the end, we just felt it was, uh, - uh, too confusing, right? - (murmuring assent) Too confusing. And, uh, The White Album has some diversity issues. How? That's a lot of white, Jack. And I know you were pretty enthusiastic about Abbey Road. I gotta say, it didn't have a lot going for it... if I can put it to you like that. Uh, it's just a road, with a bunch of people driving down the wrong side of the street. - (chuckles) - (laughter) That's not exactly what I meant, but... But we've been developing some ideas of our own, now. You know, we weren't just sitting around. We focused on the one thing that makes this man here unlike anyone else in the entire world of music today. No collaborators, no cowriters, no samples, no steals, hmm? No "featuring Cardi B," no "featuring Bieber." Just the simple, pure genius... of One Man Only. - (indistinct chatter) - Mmm, mmm, mmm.

Yeah, well, they're... they're insane to me. - I mean, who here's excited about this album? - (cheering) Listen to that. In this age of, sometimes, 16 people writing on one song, suddenly, here's a guy, him and a guitar, and he writes everything himself, on his own. Yeah. I mean...

But tell me anyway. Um... n-number two is... I've been seeing someone. Right. Do I know him? Yeah. It's Gavin. I-I didn't want you to find out from someone else. Every day, he puts me in the right column. Of course. The "true love" one. - (knocking on glass) - Of course. I've gotta go. Ah, God. Yeah, course you do. Um, okay. Bye. Bye. What? What could possibly be so urgent that I can't make a single phone call?! How the hell am I supposed to get any of the songs right if you're just all clustering me and stopping me from being creative? How can I ever be creative if I'm never ever left alone?! Okay. We'll leave you alone then, genius. No, I'm not... I'm sorry. No, it's g... It's, uh, it's superstar rights. Treat the people that you work with like shit on your shoes. Hmm. (sighs) Ellie told you the news, then? - Yeah. - You know, I never, never understood what you didn't see in her. I mean, i-if I'd been you, twice a day I would have loved her up like a lusty lion. Rocky, if I ask you to just shut up, really, really, really shut up, would that be okay? Right. Can I just start again and say, "Isn't it wonderful news? "And I hope they'll be very happy together and have gorgeous kids." Is that better? No. It's worse. I have got a third option. But... I'm sorry. Um, I'm really sorry, everyone. I'm just... I'm really stressed. What was so urgent? (over speaker): Oh, um, no, nothing. It's just we have to decide today where and when we're going to launch the album. So, nothing big, apart from probably the biggest decision of your stupid life. - What? - You ass. I do have one thought. - (crowd cheering) - NEWSCASTER: And the little town of Gorleston has never seen anything like this before. At 3:00 p.m. today, on the rooftop of the Pier Hotel, Jack Malik, local boy turned pop phenomenon, will premiere his highly anticipated first album. And word seems to have got out. (cheering) (cheering continues in distance) (knocking on door) Can we, uh...? Wow. Look at this. Look at you. (sighs) Didn't want to disturb. Just wanted to, you know... Well, it's... Who'd have thought? (chuckles) While we were downstairs drinking cider and eating jelly, you were up in your room writing "She Loves You." - (chuckles) - Well... Are you, uh, you playing our song? - Your song? - "Let It Be." Oh, well, we've never forgotten we were the first people to hear it. Well, the start of it, at least. Three times. (chuckles) So proud. Our beautiful, blazing boy. - (clicks tongue) Aw. Oh. - Aw. Still, don't wanna... - Mind your suit, love. It's... blue. - Yeah. - We'll leave you to it. - Okay. One last thing, son. Yeah, Dad? The sandwiches. I see there's tuna. Are y-you gonna finish them all? - No, please take them all. - Or if you don't...? Oh, what a day. What an amazing day. - (whispers): Sorry. - (sighs) (door closes) (helicopter blades whirring outside) (sighs) CROWD (chanting): Jack! Jack! Jack! Jack! Jack! - (chanting continues outside) - Well, you look good. (chuckles): That's a tight pant. - (chuckles) - Mmm. (clicks tongue) Okay. We've got a jaw and a chin. Ooh! (chuckles) That's not bad. That's... This'll work. This'll work. Mmm. - (kisses) - Don't... (door closes) - What? - Nothing. - (knocking on door) Yeah? (sighs, chuckles) - Oh. Hi, Ellie. Come in. - (chuckles): Hi. - And who have we here? - Um, Debra, this is Ellie. Ellie, this is Debra, my agent. - (sighs) - No! The Ellie? - Oh! He's mentioned me? - (chuckles) No, no. I'm kidding. I know nothing about his life because he's a product to me. Unless you're the one that was his manager. In which case, wow. Huge mistake giving that up. Oh, it's surreal, isn't it? Being back at the Pier Hotel. - (chuckling): Yeah, indeed. - Oh. - I'm gonna go look at the stage, yeah? - Mm. - Yeah. - It's this way. Press conference in ten. Goodbye, lovebirds. (door closes) I'm sorry. I shouldn't have left Lime Street, okay? - It was a terrible mistake. - Oh, no. - Don't say that, please. - Can we...? - Don't say that. - Elle... I-I've heard your new songs. - They're incredible. - O-Okay. No, they aren't. I don't even know who you are anymore. Everything changed after the accident. - Wha-What happened? - GAVIN: Jack. - And here's Gavin. - Jack, Jack. - Jack! - (Jack chuckles) - Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack. - Oh, hey, mate. - Jack. - How you doing, man? - Jack. Jack. - (Ellie chuckles) - I don't know what to say. - Oh, really? It sounds like you do and it's, "Jack." - (chuckles) - Jack! - Oh... - We were just coming to say good luck and, um, - break a leg. - Yeah. Well, if I fall off the roof, then a broken leg will be a good result. (chuckles): All right, then. Let's go. Come on. GAVIN: Ka-ching! (quietly): Ellie. ♪ ♪ - ELLIE: Ooh. - Wow. Looks pretty quiet. Well, maybe we should do a slightly shorter set? - I mean really quiet. - (window slides open) What do you want? Uh, we're here for the gig. I'm the musician. Well, that's pretty tricky. 'Cause we closed three weeks ago. I'd take it as a hint, I would. JACK: I'm gonna have to give up the part-time jobs, go back to teaching. (tires screeching) - (grunts, sighs) - What? No. Don't go back to teaching. I've got no choice. Jack, if you go back to teaching, that is when you've got no choice. Yeah, because you'll end up putting all your genius into all those kids and then you won't have any i-imagination or energy left to put into your music, which really matters. - Please... - (chuckles) Okay, okay. Crazy, slightly mad woman. (laughs) REPORTER: No one has ever written this many great songs in this short a time. - How do you do it? - Honestly, I don't know. - (laughter) - Sometimes it feels like someone else has written all the songs. - (laughter) - Any idea who? - (laughter) - What's the inspiration behind "Strawberry Fields Forever"? - (clears throat) Well... - Who was your favorite, John, Paul, George or Ringo? - Sorry? - Who's your greatest influence? Jack, is it true that you wrote "Long and Winding Road" in... W-Why don't you record in Abbey Road like they did? (overlapping shouting) When can we see another album, Jack? Jack, what's the story behind "Let it Be"? How'd you come up with "Yesterday"? Thank you so much. We have to go to the roof now. We'll see you later. Jack, what was the first song you ever wrote? Jack, what are you gonna play for us today? It's a nice bar they've got down there, actually. You haven't been drinking, have you? No, I have not. Well, y-yeah, I have. But I find a couple of pints midday sharpens my senses. - Oh! - I'm not sure it does, mate. - (sighs) - Right, here goes. Actually, before I open this door, can I just say, for a long time I didn't really know why I'd been born. Felt a bit pointless. But now I do know. I was born to serve the greatest musician of all time. It is my honor now to open this door for the moment the entire world has been waiting for. Thanks, Rock. Oh, it's certainly been one hell of a journey, hasn't it? So it has. So it has. Right. Here goes. No, that's not... Uh, wrong door. Um, let us, let us continue our journey together. Right.

And that's why, tonight, I asked Ed if I could come on and play, 'cause I want to tell her... and you, - what I've done. - WOMAN: What are you saying? Darn it, Ellie, I've been untrue. All the songs I've sung tonight were really written and performed by four men called John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr. The Beatles. They were the real geniuses. Me, I'm just a, sort of, go-between to, well, get their astonishing stuff into the world. - MAN: Beatles? - And, uh, I-I-I passed their amazing work off as my own so I could look like I was amazing, too. (crowd jeering) I want you all to know that I'm not gonna take any money for this work that isn't mine. So, you can have all the songs for free. Rocky, do it. ROCKY: Right. Here goes. JACK: They're being released, for free, online now. And I'd love to not take any more praise for it. So, um... I'm so sorry. And while I'm at it, there's one other thing to say as well, because...

(quietly): No. That is very bad behavior. - On a global scale. - Yeah. It's very bad. Well, this is a strange one. Of course I've always known I was number two. But that's not a bad place to be. Some of the best songs never made it to number one. "Common People" by Pulp, for a start. It's a total classic. And obviously all I want is for Ellie to be happy. Gavin. Best man I ever met.
