[upbeat Christmas music] ♪ ♪ - in part one of this "dear Christmas" episode, we explored all the trappings of the Christmas season... cutting down the tree, drinking hot cocoa, putting up the lights, decorating the house, the ugly sweater party. It's the perfect backdrop to fall in love. But is it love? Or is the season? Are you really falling in love, or are you just in love with Christmas? Maybe when the snow melts, you'll fall out of love, and it's over, like a seasonal allergy. Holiday love is very complicated at Christmas. You can't just crack it that easily. That's why we're gonna continue this episode next week, live. I'll be talking about the magical, elusive gift that is very hard to wrap: True love. So if you have a true love story that you'd like to share for episode two of "dear Christmas," send it in. I'll be livestreaming part two from a place I truly love, my childhood home. Until then, dear Christmas, this is Natalie Morgan, reminding you to enjoy the season, and don't eat too many cookies. - Merry Christmas. - Oh, penny, merry Christmas. I just finished episode one of "dear Christmas." it'll drop tomorrow. How's the party going on out there? - Missing its favorite guest. - Oh, I know. But I really have to get on the road soon. - I wanted to see you before you headed out. I have a little Christmas bonus for you. - Wow. [both laugh] oh, wow! - I thought it might put you in a "wow" kind of mood. - Is that right? - Earmuffs had a great year, thanks to you. Which means, as the owner of earmuffs, I had a great year too. Natalie, you have the number one podcast in the country. I want to keep you happy, so anything I can do to make you even happier, let me know. - Anything? - Anything. - Well, I do have to wrap all these Christmas presents. - Ah, ooh, okay. Ooh. Let me help; I got the door. - [laughing] okay. - Who's this for? - Oh, it's for my dad. I had it special ordered. - Does your dad love lake Tahoe books? - Um, he better. He owns it. Yeah, with my mom. They just bought it. Yeah. [laughs] - aww, who's this for? - Oh, my sister. - Your sister's tiny. - Yeah. Well, she's having a baby. Actually, it's due on Christmas eve. - Oh. Oh, I hate to think of who you're giving this to. - Well, that is for me. - It's hideous. - [laughs] well, my parents have an ugly sweater party every year, and there's a contest for who wears the ugliest sweater. - I think you're gonna definitely win this year. - Aw, thanks. I'm trying. Ah, I can't wait to go home for Christmas. My parents go all out with the decorations, and the house is so lit up that you can probably see it from space. - Well, I will look for it when I go out to space. Oh, fancy. Who'd you buy this for? A special someone? - No, I didn't buy it. It's from one of our sponsors. And it's for my brother-in-law. - Oh, I thought maybe you had someone tucked away in lake Tahoe. A hometown honey? - Uh, that's a big, fat no. - Really? I've never seen you date anyone around here, so I guess I figured you had someone there. You've been in love before, right? - Yeah, I've been in love a bunch of times. I just...you know, never found my "true love." - so you don't believe in true love? - No, I do. You know, for other people, just not really for me. Are you gonna help me wrap or what? - Ted and I broke up. - Oh, I'm so sorry. - He was a quintessential boyfriend till he wasn't. - You know, I keep telling you you should give hank in hr a chance. You know, nothing wrong with a workplace romance, as long as the paperwork's signed. - I thought I was in love. - And you probably were. You know, but maybe he just wasn't your true love. - Well, what's the difference between love and true love? Aren't they all the same? - Of course not. Don't you listen to my podcast? - No, I have million other people do that for me. - [scoffs] well, you know, true love is when two people find each other. And those two worlds come together as one, and all those people want is to be together, you know, no matter how tough things get, you just...you can't imagine your life without them. - I should really start listening to your podcast. - Yeah, you should. - [laughs] hey, maybe this Christmas it's your turn to find true love. - Oh yeah, I can already feel my heart beating.

But if I'm perfectly honest, I don't think my parents really thought it through when they named me christopher. - Thought what through? - High school. Christopher became chris. Massey became mass. Before I knew it, everybody was calling me "christmas." - your nickname is christmas. - I added the "mr." to show some maturity. - I like it. You know, it suits you. - Hmm. - Hmm. - So what about your name? - Well, natalie is because my parents go overboard at christmas. And morgan was shortened from the german morganstern.
