HUMAN COBRAS You think it's them again? Yes. They found me. Wait! I'll go. A wire for you. What? I gotta go back to New York. Right now. No! No! They'll kill you! Today they failed, but if you go back you're done! Stay, please! I have to go. - Stop right there Tony! - You crossed the line this time. - You shouldn't have crossed their path. - Tony! - 1 got a contract on you! - But l can't doit. - Get the Hell out of here! - Go away! - Don't you ever come back to the States! - Beat it! Tony! - Don't leave me Tony! Tony! - Tony! Goodbye Leslie... I can't take you with me. Maybe I'll have to hide and run for all my life Goodbye! - Tony! Tail'em! Stop here! - Excuse me Sir! I have my girlfriend at the hospital... and she's going to have a baby and I need to call her! Thanks! Very kind. Who are you? What are you looking for? I'm the janitor of the building. Why are you here? The door was open! Hello? Hello! Hello! - Tony? - Tony, its you? Leslie? Leslie! Your flat is upside down! - You shouldn't have gone there. - It's dangerous! Where are you? I was worried sick. Why didn't you call me earlier? - I couldn't. I'll explain you later. - I beg you: come get me. Of course! Where are you now? - I'm in Brooklyn. Clinton Street. - Number 1112. Flat 6. Tony! Gimme a break! I gotta sleep! I work night shifts! You know... This was the only safe place. How did my brother die? I want to know! We were at the game, last sunday. I don't understand rugby, but... I often went with him just to make him happy. John! Johnny! He died on the spot. How is it possible? With all that crowd around... Who was near to you? They shot him from a distant range. Just one shot. A rifle with a viewfinder. That's what the cops say. I can't believe this is a vendetta against me! When I heard that you were moving to Kenya I was relieved. But why the Hell did you keep coming back to New York? You know how your brother was. He was never content with what he got. Down there... in Kenya he was doing business with George. With George Mac Grieves, you remember him? No... But he used his New York trips to take care of other business. He was working with a guy called Mortimer. I don't konw exactly what kind of business it was... Terence Mortimer? Yes! A shady guy. He was in my old gang. I know someone who can tell me where I can find him. - No! What do you think you're doing? They'll kill you! I'll beg you! I'm scared don't leave me alone! I gotta find out who did it! - Foster Av. 47. - Maybe you're a bit late for the meeting. Get me to the Fish Market! Hello. I'm looking for Max. Maxi? He's not been working here for three years. Where can I find him? I dunno... I think he's living in Foster Av. Everybody knows him there. Thanks! Tony? What do you want? Why are you here? Have heard about my brother Johnny? Yes. Well, I wanna know who did it and why. Quiet, please, quiet! I don't know a thing! I'm not in the racket anymore! It's three years now... I know he was in touch with Mortimer... where do I find him? I don't know! I'm not seeing anyone anymore! Where do I have to go to find out! Miguel! The Pamplona Restaurant! In Flatbush. Flatbush! A Whiskey and an information. Mortimer. Where do I find him? Think hard about it. You'll see... you'll remember it. Go. Close the door. - Why? Who are you? Are you deaf? Shut the door! Ok... Isn't it a bit too early to call it a day my friend? - No. It's the right time. We have to deliver you a message. A rather urgent one... And since the mailmen are striking... we've come to tell you in person! - Come Girls... Let's go... - Oh, come on... Why are you wastin' my time? Where do you think you're going? I wanna talk with Alfie. I'm Tony Gardner. We're friends. - You too... get up please... - Come on... a little bit of energy... - You're all sleepwalking today... Just a sec! Go to bed earlier! 1, 2, 3... Come on! Mister Gardner, please come. Ok: I'll call you later. Come! What a surprise! Look who's here! I heard you were in Europe. I see you're in good shape. You roughed up my boys, didn't you? Good boy. You're always the same. You never keep your word! I spared you on one condition: that you would never come back! But you're always the same hothead. You're back and you'll get in trouble again. I'm back for Johnny. Yes, I know. What can I do for you? I want to know who killed my brother! If they whacked him, he must have done something for sure. Who may have done it? Everyone. Except me, of course. 1 did not even know him. Yeah. But you know Mortimer very well. Hold on a sec. Let's think it out. Mortimer has not worked for me for four years. And I never gave a shit to find out who is he working for now. But wait a sec... - Yes? - Get me Mortimer's address right now! - Right away Sir! As you can tell, I'm still your friend. But you know the game. We don't cross your path unless you don't cross ours. - Got it? - Mr. Halsey? Yes? - Mortimer lives in Pennsylvania Av. 1121. Breakfast, Sir. -Ah um... Thanks. - Here, take... Thanks. What the...! Mortimer! Let me in! It's Tony. -1 don't wanna see anybody! - 1 don't know shit. Go away! Mortimer: I told you it's Tony. Johnny's brother. Open up! - Go away, go away! Get the hell out of here, Tony. I got nothing to tell you. Watch it: I got a gun! Beat it! Or I'm gonna do something stupid. Put that gun away. Go away. I told you to leave. Ok, cool. I'm leaving. As you wish, Mortimer. Who killed Johnny? You are not suspecting I did it, are you? You're here to kill me, aren't you? I'm not here to kill you... but I'll do it if you don't start talking! Allright, Tony, ok... I wasn't scoring well... Johnny had been in Kenya for a year... One day he came to see me. He told me that down there grass is cheap. Here the price is more than doubled! But by the ounce. I needed serious dough. And he helped me out. Things were going pretty well. - But they put a bullet in his brain. - Why did they take off just him and spared me? So I locked myself here. Our little business must have upset someone. So they went for the guns. They were going to kill you too, isn't it? You sure you didn't forget anything? I swear... They killed Johnny just to settle a score? Think hard, Mortimer! There must be something else! You mean something personal...? Not that I know... Right... Listen: if you have to tell me something you're not remembering now... I'm at the usual hotel. You remember it? Oh yes, of course. That's enough, cool down. The Lady will tell us all. You shouldn't have called your brother in law. I told him not to set foot in New York again. But I didn't tell him to come! I just send him a wire. I had to tell him his brother died. Yeah, right. But why did you tell him that we killed his brother? I haven't said anything! I don't know who killed him! I just want to leave this damned country! Leslie! Tony, now that you're awake, do you mind chatting? Scumbag! Don't get upeset, Tony. Try to be reasonable. The boys are not used to this kind of things, anymore. No one wants to resort to violence anymore. Now we're striving for lawfulness. You're a filthy liar! Think, Tony. Why should we have cared about Johnny's dealing? And why should we blow his brains in a crowded stadium? Just to get noticed by everyone? A professional did my brother! Yes, that may be true. But some asshole that works on his own. You see Tony, if you wanna kill someone... it's easier to stab him with a four inch knife in the ribs at Central Park in broad daylight! Untie him! Sorry Leslie, but I had no choice. You know it Tony, I'm a quiet man. Otherwise we could have... smoked you. But I rather avoid bloodshed. Try to look somewhere else, ok? A man like you... has always lots of enemies. Tony! Let's get out of here! - Yeah right! Go to hell! Thanks. Wow! A Rockefeller! First you scare me shitless... and then you pay me off with nothing. I'm Tony Gardner. I booked two rooms. Mr. Gardner? I have a message for you here. Quick, let's go. Mortimer has something important to tell us. Take the luggage to the rooms, please. - Of course. I may be silly, but I was thinking that if nothing had happened me and you, we could be... It will never be like before again. Never. I know. The door is open. Weird... He was scared shitless... Mortimer! - Mortimer! Don't move. It's me: Tony. Leslie! Leslie! Leslie... He's dead. He wanted to tell me something. A'G'... Before he died, he wrote a 'G'... What was Johnny's african partner's name again? Mac Grieves... And the first name? George... Let's drop everything Tony... Let's get the hell out of here! Let's get away! Sure, hon... Leslie! Leslie, how are you? What a pleasure to see you again! Hello George... Always more gorgeous, ain't it? I apologise for being late. That's Tony... George McGrieves. I'm Tony Gardner, Johnny's brother. Put the luggage in the car. - Come, I guess you're tired. - Yes... -Hop in. - Thanks. Your brother's death has shocked me. We were friends, more than partners. How did you get the news? Watch it asshole! Damn! If you don't pay attention you'll kill more people in the city than in a safari! - Excuse me. You were saying? I was asking you how did you know about my brother's death. Well, I read it in an american newspaper. I couldn't believe it. - So I called immediately Leslie. I see... - Is Johnny's place far away? - No... Just outside the city. And you? Where do you live? In the same house, of course. The villa is very spacious. They bought the house together. You were sharing everything... like two good brothers. Sure! Like two good brothers. Get down! Tony, can I get up now? That car was tailing us from the airport. Come on Tony, we're not in NY! Hello. Hello, Tony. How's it going? Very good. It's a beautiful place. It feels like being in the garden of Eden. So, you'll stay a little? Dunno, maybe. Get breakfast, Clay. When you'll feel like it, I'll show you around. Yeah, of course. I'd like it. Everything you see plus the land beyond that hills... belongs to me. Um, well... Mine and Johnny's... Of course... What I'm wondering about is how you and him could put together such a fortune. Just a few things that lucked out. I can smell good business and Johnny had a small capital of money. Kenya it's a wonderful country. It's modern, welcoming, wild dynamic... There's a good chance of making money rather quickly. I take care of every business opportunity. Small and big. Even though I get my real kicks from big hunting. Hey, now that we're talking... Do you like hunting? Well, it depends on the kind of hunt. Let's get breakfast! You know, we are on the highlands... if you wanna stay in shape, do exactly as I do. Eat a lot and often! Possibly light and energetic food. You'll feel like a lion. - Did the Lady get up? - Not yet. What will you have? Tea? Coffee? Or fruit juice? I'll have tea, thanks. Served! Johnny killed that one! He too was a big hunting freak. Later I'll show you the list of all real estates your brother shared with me. Um, I forgot... Johnny left no will. His share will go to Leslie. Anyway due to his sudden death, I'm dealing with a lot of trouble. You know: documents, lawyers... death duties... Beautiful. Yes. It's a fantastic 306 caliber. At what range can you hit a target with this? I can hit a gazelle even from 200 meters. While she's running... Wow. Well... not always, I miss too sometimes. I forgot: in the garage is your brother's car. Use it as much as you want, if you like. Well, thanks. Later I want to go the city. Of course. Whenever you want. Who is it? It's me, George. I'm bathing. Don't come in. Uhmm... beautiful! Please George, don't come in. I'm naked. OK, I'll wait for you here. Oh, come on. What's happening with you? The brother in law is here and we're not friends anymore? You got tired of me? Please, George, it's not the time. I saw how you looked at Tony. Tell me: are you in love with him? Go away, George. Lucky bastard, the brother in law. In one move he gets the money and his brother's lady. Go away! All right. Everything's ok? What? What are you looking at? What are you asking him for? You know he can't answer you. On the other hand he's very bright. I understand him better than if he could speak. He said that you look incredibly like your brother. He was very fond of Johnny. Are you going to the city? Uh uh... Careful, in Kenya you keep left... For those who are not used to it, it's a bit dangerous. - Be careful. - Don't worry. I'll keep my eyes open. See ya later. Bye. Good morning, doctor. Hello, George. How's it going? Good. Here's a sample of the black mamba you requested. I think it will be enough. Yes. - Thank you. - You're welcome. For this one we'll need a large cup. Hello, Clay. Goodnight. Go to sleep, if you want. Yes, yes, I know, but I'm in a hurry! - Hi! - Good evening Sir. Hello everybody! Good evening Sir. What will you have? George Mac Grieves. You know him? Yes, Sir. Of course. It's weird: he told me we would meet here, but I can't see him. Try to look for him in... in the gambling room. Oh, thanks. Very kind. My pleasure, Sir. - You have won, Milady. - Keep'em for me please. What? Something's wrong? You look an awful lot like a very good friend of mine. His name was Johnny. He was my brother. He looked a lot like me. Shall we have a drink? I'd love to. Hello? Who's this? Who's there? Who's there! Who are you down there? Oh my God... Johnny! Oh noo! No! Help! Help! Leslie! It's me, George! Oh, George! - Calm down! - There was... someone in the garden! Calm down please! I saw him! It pains me watching you like this. I saw Johnny in the garden. I swear I saw him. There's no one in the garden. You're just exhausted. It's been a hard blow. Try to forget. If I could only stay closer to you. So, tell me how it went down. What? The thing you were talking to me about. Ah, yes. Remember? When Johnny left you waiting. Yes, it was exactly the day before he left for New York. You don't remember the address? No: too dark. I remember only that I waited a lot. Then he arrived... he was weird... out of his mind... that's the only thing I remember. Yeah... but it's very important for me, try to remember that address. I believe I have it written down someplace. But if it means that much to you I'll go home looking for it. Yes, I'd like that. Get dressed. I'll drive you. As you like. Good evening Sir. Good evening. One of the back lights is switched off. And the license plate light is off too. You're right. But my wife is not feeling well... she's not used staying up late. - I'll take care of it first thing in the morning. - I'm sorry for your Lady, Sir. I hope she gets well soon. I'll let you go this time. But please be more careful in the future. Yes, of course. Thanks. - Goodnight. - You too. Oh, it's you Clay. You scared me. still up? Leslie? Oh Tony... I gotta talk to you. Oh Tony, Tony... I'm so glad to see you. At last you're here. I had a horrible nightmare. What the hell am I talking about? It's not possible! I tought I saw Johnny. Johnny! Yes. There, in the garden... It was only a shadow... but I think it was him! Oh my God! It's been terrible! I don't know what happened to me... But I thought I was going crazy! And then... on the phone... that breath... - That awful breathing... - like a death rattle... the breath of an agonizing man... Tony, please! Get me to a doctor! I can't take it no more! Calm down Leslie. I can't, I can't... Calm down... Someone's been here in your room. What? Someone who had been in the garden. George arrived when I screamed. George? Yes, George. - He's been here? - Yes! Look at these footprints. Come. It's Johnny's room, isn't it? Yes! Look! These are Johnny's shoes! That blood... that blood on the pillow... Someone is trying to scare us away from this place. You knew a certain Clarissa? Who told you? Told what? About Johnny and Clarissa. She told me. I met her by chance at the casino. Or maybe it's wasn't by chance. - She said she knew who killed Johnny. But she did not have the time to tell me. They strangled her. They killed her like Mortimer. Maybe to prevent her from talking or... to frame me with a murder. You know I was thinking that if you and I would go away... your dear George could keep everything. You're suspecting George? Why are you protecting him? Because you sleep with him? Stay with me... No, I can't... when I'm close to you... Well, how was it? I have to be back in ten days. I'll never get done with this paperwork. What did I tell ya? Even down here, bureaucracy is the same old rusty machine. But I know what you need. I organized a safari. We'll be out there 10 days. Far away from the city, from everything. It will be incredible. You'll see. Wow! Not bad at all. Well done. It's your turn Leslie. Take it. Let's check Tony's score... It's for you. Someone's on the phone. For me? Sorry, folks... - Oh, shit... Thanks... Yes? It's me. - The dead body of a girl has been fished out of the Tikai waterfalls. - She's been strangled. - You know anything about it? Who's talking? - Tony? - Come on, it's your turn! I might have hit it this time. Please Leslie, check my score. Grab it! And? 30. Ummm. Not bad... Bullseye! I lost. - Hello Captain... Mr. Tony Gardner? Yes, it's me. You should come with us, Sir. - The Chief Inspector would like to talk to you. - To avoid any useless nuisances, we'll drive you to the station. Now? Yes, Sir. Will you please follow us? Of course. Tony! You'll need a lawyer. Why should he need a lawyer? Well, I don't know... You know, seeing him taken away like this... It sure ain't the first time he has to deal with the cops. Tony's right! You're a... A..? Scumbag? Why not? Try to be serious, for once. Tony's always had enemies. People that doesn't fool around. Come on. It's surely just a routine check. Maybe his passport has expired. The Captain is a friend of mine. I'll drop by at the station. Everything will be cleared. And tomorrow we'll leave for the safari. George... I'm afraid that Tony is in a mess. And I'm really worried. It's fate. What? Nothing, just talking... You never worry about me. I have to go now. I have to pack the last things. We'll see us later. And so you took her home from the casino? - Yes. Right at home? Well, near her place... She told she wanted to walk a bit. Can you tell me please in what district of the city? It was dark. And I don't know Nairobi very well. When did you arrive in Kenya? Three days ago. Strange... it's very strange. The victim came to see me two weeks ago. She feared she might get killed. She was a friend of Johnny Gardner. Your brother. Correct? Yes. It's correct. I see. Your brother argued violently with the girl a few weeks ago. At the casino, to be precise. The day after your brother left for New York. Unfortunately, that was going to be his last trip. Here: he's on the passenger list. May I have a look? Of course. George Mac Grieves. You feel all right? Uh? Oh yes. I'm ok. Thanks. One last question: can you tell me up until what time you stayed with the victim? Until midnight... more or less. Thank you, Mr. Gardner. That's it. Unfortunately, I'll have to keep your passport. Standard procedure. Tomorrow I have scheduled a safari. May I still go or...? But of course... You just can't leave the country... and should you remember something useful... please come see. At any time. Don't worry. Goodbye, Mr. Gardner. Goodbye. Good hunting. Thank you. You too. See? The tracks have not fooled me. Great! How many can they be? Maybe 15, more or less. Is a huge male among them? A couple, I guess. The tusks must weigh at least 150 pounds! Wow! Maybe they have heard the noise of the engine? No, I don't think so. They can't smell us. See Leslie? Let's do it this way: you hide behind those trees over there. You don't move a muscle until I tell you to do so. I'm going to check on the elephants. Come Tony. May I shoot too? I wouldn't suggest it, Lady. There are young one in the group too. And in this case the adults are more dangerous. May I have the binoculars, please? Yes, of course. My God! How are you? I'm fine. Everything ok? Everything ok. Excuse me, Tony. It never happened to me. That beast out of blue took me by surprise. Don't sweat it. These things happen. - The hunt's surely over for today. Where's Leslie? Tony: you mind calling her? Lunch's getting cold. All right. What a jackass I've been. Let's hope the elephants have not moved. - Leslie? Lunch's ready. What? - It's ready. We're waiting for you. I can't hear you. Wait a sec! What? Lunch's ready. I'm coming. What? I have been so scared today. Don't think about it. In someone's planes you should have been crying tonight... over my dead body. What are you talking about? A stupid hunting accident. What are you thinking about? It was just a moment of distraction. Like Johnny... He wanted to kill me the same way. But it did not work this time. Remember: it's forbidden to kill the females... and the young ones that carry less than 30 pounds of ivory. - You recognize the females from the smaller tusks. - That's the male. He's excellent. - He's at least 90 pounds. - I don't wanna miss this one. A bit more on the left and I'd killed it! - He's only wounded... Watch out for the reactions! Don't let'em smell you! Leslie, come here! Quick! Get back in the car! Tony! Take shelter! And stick together you two! What a thrill! A wounded elephant becomes unpredictable. Anyways, it's forbidden to leave him wounded... We have to kill him. Isn't this a wonderful country? Wonderful. You want to compare it with life in New York? Smoke, pollution, traffic... I'd go mental down there! Have you ever been back to New York? No. Never. Your memory fails you. You went back the 19th of May to kill my brother. And maybe you killed him with the same rifle you have in your hands now. What are you talking about? I'm here to avenge him. Watch out! Run! Stop! What's wrong with you? Are you crazy? Stop or I'll shoot you! Nooo! Tony! Nooo! How could you even think about a story like that? Let me explain! George! He did it! He must have done it! So it is really a farewell, Tony? There's no longer place for me here. But... why? Johnny has been avenged. Don't leave me alone. It's better this way for both of us. Maybe one day... Its' done. He's gone. Poor Tony. I guess he was beginning to suspect something... From now on everything is yours... Yeah, as it was planned, Gary... Clay scared you, didn't he? He was the only one who knew the truth. Sooner or later we would have brought Tony on the right track. You've been perfect! Your money is on a swiss account by your name in Geneva. But didn't we say, here and cash? You don't trust me anymore? Who did you put on the plane under George's name? Tony! You knew it would be not enough to kill Johnny. Come on, Tony, listen... You wouldn't believe... You wouldn't believe that I... You did it for filthy money, bitch! - Tony, nooo... - Damn' whore! - Listen, Tony! George wasn't guilty! You made me kill an innocent! You murder! Damn' whore! The End Subtitles by Giona A. Nazzaro
