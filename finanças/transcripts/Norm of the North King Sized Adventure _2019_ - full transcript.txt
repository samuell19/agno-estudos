Subtitles by explosiveskull Missed me. Why are you doing this, Dexter? We were partners. The artifacts... - Should be mine. - No! It belongs to the people. Well, I'm a people. And I know how to make a fortune from it. You'll make us both crash. Sorry, kids. Running late. Got to see Grandpa. Whoa. No. No. Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Sorry, Pete and Belle. Didn't see ya. I'm late. I'm late. Oh, gosh. I got to get to Grandpa. I'm late. He's gone. Oh, great. He's right there. It's fine. It's fine. It's fine. It's fine. It's fine. I got it. Hi, Grandpa. I got... I got... You're late. Sorry, Grandpa. Is everything all right? More than all right. I have a request of you, Norm. Uh, it doesn't involve trimming your nose hairs again, - does it? - No. I want you, as king, to preside over a wedding. Sure. Whose? Mine! You know that Judith and I have been spending a lot of time together. And I've come to realize that I love her and she loves me. And we want to marry. And according to tradition, since you are king, I am asking your approval. My approval, eh? Hmm. Well, you know what I say. I say abso-bear-lutely. This is fantastic. A wedding, followed by, uh, a wedding party. Let's do it. When? Tonight? According to tradition, a former king's wedding can only occur under the special glow - of the Aurora Borealis. - The Northern Lights. So many colors, red, green, uh, blue green, uh, sort of a yellowy green. Um, I guess really mostly green. Uh, Norm! Norm! Stop naming colors. The Aurora Borealis is due to occur in exactly six days. Six days? Got it. I'm so happy for you, and for you, Judith. Now, are you sure you'll be there to perform the ceremony? Your word is your bond. And in things, both large and small, giving your word and being true to your word means everything. Yes. Your subjects must know that when a king says he will be somewhere or do something, he will not let them down. Well said, Socrates. Hmm. I got it. Plus, I need to set an example. My family and the bears of my kingdom look up to me. And, hey, hey, we got a wedding coming up. I need to let my human pals know. Don't worry, I got this. Oh. Ow. It hurts. Ow. Hey, Olympia, Vera. Hi, Fong. - Hi, Norm. - Hello. Wonderful to see you. What's up? Big stuff. My Grandpa is getting married. A later-in-life marriage, such a beautiful thing. Oh, we'll have to get a gift for the happy couple. Uh, bears don't do the gift thing. We have everything we need, snow, ice, fish. Uh, more snow, more ice, more fish. Okay. Then what about the reception? Have you made plans? Yup. We plan to have it in six days. Never mind. We'll help out. Any ideas about food, decorations, entertainment? Yes. Those would be good. Okay, then great. So you'll all come? - Of course, we will. - Mm-hmm. Because we're always there for each other. And I know when you say you'll be here, it's a promise, right? Yes. Of course. And a promise means giving your word. - And your word is your bond. - Norm, we said we'd be there and we'll be there. Great. So, just to be clear, I have your word on this? - Mm-hmm. - Say it. You have our word. Hey! It's the new app I put on your phone, Pop. It tracks UFOs. - What's that? - You know, Pops, Unidentified Flying Objects, spaceships, aliens. No, I mean what's an app? It's a digitally-downloaded application that... It's a special thing your phone does. The app is telling me that we've got some flying objects. And now they're gone. Weird. Some strange doings over by Misty Mountain Glacier. Uh, why would anyone even wanna go to Misty Mountain Glacier? It's so misty and mountain-y and, uh, glacier-y. It is indeed a strange and dangerous place. Some blizzards, avalanches, shrouded by fog. Sounds cool, I'm in. Uh-huh. Nope. This is a job for a king, which I am. And I gave my word to protect this kingdom, and I will keep my word - because... - Pop... Just go, okay? Yes, I will. Alone. As befits a king. I'm not, uh, afraid. Uh... Okay. I got this. I got this. Huh? Hey, no lemmings. This is a solo mission. Guys, this is a dangerous place. Hear that? Blizzard winds. Now, go! Hmm? I wonder what happened to the pilot. Oh, footprints. Aha. Aha! Huh? Hmm. This is what little dude must have been looking for. Hey! Are you okay? Oh, this can't be good. Hey, there! A talking polar bear? You must be Norm of the North. Yeah. Except I got this promotion. Not a big deal. But I'm now King Norm of the North. And I believe this belongs to you. Oh, thank goodness. This has to be returned to China immediately. Well, no way we're getting out of this cave until morning, when the sun warms the ice a bit and makes the digging out easier. Hmm. Whoa. You okay? Just a little shaken by the cave-in and woozy from the plane crash. What are you doing out here? This place is dangerous and misty. I dropped this down here because someone was trying to steal it from me. I'd flown so far off course, I ran out of gas. I landed it as best I could. Yeah, I saw your plane down by the... Wait. You threw this valuable artifact thing out the window? Yes, but it had a computer chip so I knew I could find it again. And I did, here in this cave, but then the cave-in occurred. I feel great shame and sorrow. Well, who's trying to steal it form you? A man named Dexter. He and I were partners. Curators of antiquity in China at a university museum. But a few years ago, I noticed that some of the antiquities had gone missing. And I suspected that they had been stolen. Dexter swore he knew nothing about these thefts, but I had my suspicions. I placed computer chips on all the antiquities. Should one get stolen, I would be able to track its location. My suspicions about Dexter soon proved to be true. I caught him red-handed selling off an ancient relic. Fired by the university board, Dexter left in disgrace. You see, the artifact is of great value. Beyond the kind that money can bring. It is the key to the hidden treasures of ancient Chinese emperors contained within the Mountain of Nine Cauldrons. And it must be returned to China immediately so it can used for an event that occurs but once every hundred years. Promise me something, Norm. If I don't make it, you will see that this gets to my grandson, Chen. Uh, what are you talking about? You said it yourself, you'll make it just fine. But if I don't, Chen lives in Beijing, teaches at the university. Beijing, university, got it. If you don't make it, I'll give the artifact to him. - Promise? - For sure. Hmm. - I have your word? - Absolutely. You can count on me. I'm a king, and a king's word is his bond. Hmm. Can you just say it? I give you my word. You have my word. Consider it given. You're gonna be just fine. Now, come on, let's get you warmed up. Here we go. All right, let's scoot over here. Sorry. Pardon me. You all right there? Norm, you're crushing me. Hey, Jin, wakey-wakey! We could try and dig our way out now. Hmm? Ah! Lemmings! Hold it. Uh, I'm worried about another cave-in if there's any kind of digging. Might be best to wait for the sun to melt the ice some more, unless you have a better idea. - Hmm? - Pee-pee! Uh, just a tip. If you get thirsty, don't eat the yellow snow. Okay. Hold it. Stop! The melting was good, but there's too much cracking. Never mind me. Save this. Safe and sound. Look out! Okay. Okay. Okay. I got this. I got this. Wouldn't wanna have to do that again. Uh, the artifact? Got it right... Hmm? Okay. Thanks. Yes. I need to catch my breath. Sure. Sure. Hey, you'll be okay. I'll get you back to home base, warm you up. I've got human friends coming. Anything you need, anything you want. There's but one thing I need or want, for you to keep you promise and return this to Beijing. Hmm. Well, well, well. Jin. I say, not looking so good, old chap. Oh, I'll have that artifact if you don't mind. I see you've made friends with the famous dancing bear. Norm, isn't it? That's King Norm, thank you very much. And, no, you may not have the artifact. You don't really want old Jin to get hit with a venom dart, do you? Probably not. Venom's a bad thing, right? Very. These particular darts are soaked in the venom of my trained Komodo dragons, Mayhem and Chaos. Yeah, he's got your eyes. And my nose. Their venom is highly toxic. In his weakened state, Jin's chances of surviving would be... Oh, I don't know. About zero. Now, the artifact, if you don't mind. No, Norm, don't. Are these rodents your henchmen? Your muscle? Oh, no. Hey, what are you... No. Oh, no. My precious artifact, give it to me! Aha! Mine. Mine. Mine. Mine. That's mine! What? May I see the desert menu, please, miss? I'll have that now. Thank you, you ursine buffoon. No, Dexter. Think of the Chinese people and their treasure. Oh, I am. And how much money I'll have after I loot it and sell it. Huh? Huh? Huh? Oh. Take care of my friend, okay? Keep him warm and let him rest. You got it, King Norm. Hey, kids! I'm sure you were all worried, me being gone all night after venturing to the mysterious Misty Mountain Glacier. Uh... Hmm? And then the blizzard. - Um, not really. - Hi, Norm. - There you are. - Norm. So good to see you, my friend. Where were you? I tried calling and calling. Uh, oops. I had it turned off. Uh, hi, Olympia. It was a difficult flight. Very blizzardy. Now, then, I wanna get some establishing shots for the video. Where's the space that the wedding will be held? Space? Um, no, we're doing it down here. Oh, are you doing it "al fresco"? - I'm sorry, Al who? - She means outside, Norm. Well, yeah. Pretty much everything around here is outside. Except for caves. Uh, but I've seen enough of those to last me a year. Yes, this whole area will be prefect. The ceremony here. The band here. All backlit by the Aurora Borealis. Oh! I just remembered. While all this planning's going on, I have to be somewhere else. I gave my word. I said I'd deliver an old artifact for my human friend, Jin, to his grandson in Beijing. Ooh, I love artifacts. Let's see it. Well, it kind of got stolen away by this bad human named Dexter. So, how will you deliver an artifact to Beijing that you don't have? Well, that's the tricky part. First step, find Dexter. Second, get the artifact back. Third, get it to Chen, Jin's grandson. But surely all that can wait until after the wedding. Nope. Well, that is gonna make the wedding planning and shooting of the video rather difficult. Since we don't speak bear. But I speak human. I've got it covered, Pops. I'll take charge. I mean, I am your oldest and next in line to be king. I guess, sure. Okay, Quinn, you're in charge. Way to go, Quinn. My good pal is acting king. I'm afraid I won't be doing any high fives while I'm king, Olympia. And though we are friends, I must be there first and foremost for all of my subjects. - This is not gonna end well. - Uh-uh. Okay, so how do I find Dexter? His plane crashed, so the only way out of here is... Huh? Helicopter. My helicopter! Huh? - Hello? - Norm, how is it going? Oh, fine. Just hanging out on Fong's helicopter. Did you get the artifact back? It's practically right in my paws. How's it going there? Well, Quinn is really taking his job of being in charge pretty seriously. I'm supposed to handle some of the food stuff. Quinn wanted me to ask what kind of fish you prefer for the main course. No. No. No. Ow. My butt! Huh? What is, "Ow-my-butt"? No, no. I said, um, halibut! It's my halibut song. It's a, you know, I sing... Oh... Bad connection. Sorry. Uh... Bye. Uh-uh. You call these salmon eggs fresh? And they're not free range either. Throw them all out. I knew this would happen. Give him a little power... You're not the boss of me. No, I'm not. I'm the boss of everyone. Oh, he just loves to play the next-in-line-to-the-throne card. Listen up, everyone, with Dad away, I'm calling the shots. I am next in line to the throne. You think? Hey, lemmings, I know the fresh air is great, but I can't help but feel it would be more comfy inside the helicopter. Oh, there you are, my precious. Dexter here. Yes? Yes, I've got it and I'll be landing in Beijing in a few hours. Just make sure you and the other buyers have your checkbooks ready. Going to Beijing, perfect! That's where Jin's grandson, Chen, lives. I just have to grab the artifact when the time is right. Which means this king is gonna take a royal nap until then. Wake me when we're getting close. Ah. Hmm? Blimey! Altitude must be getting to me. Hmm. Aha! No! No! I bet you pack of snow rats aren't alone, are you? Toodleydoo. Huh? Huh? Huh? Mm. Don't mind if I do. Crazy dream I had. Oh, no. Lemming's piloting, never a good thing. Got to get back on there. How am I gonna do that? Huh? Oh! My head is ringing. Norm residence, whom shall I say is calling? Norm, you sound funny. How's it going? Great, very relaxing trip. Tell Fong his helicopter is in good hands. Good, tiny hands. I thought we discussed this? No phone calls. You got to obey your king. You're not my king, Quinn. And anyhow, you're only acting king. And kinda acting like a jerk on top of it. I am? Oh. Nevertheless, I am to be obeyed. "Nevertheless?" What kind of bear says words like nevertheless? What the... Climb! Whoa! Whoa! King Norm here, at the tone, please leave your name and number - and... - Hey! Norm, it's me again. Quinn keeps confiscating my phone. This is so stressful. Out of the way, lemmings, King Quinn coming through. You have no idea how easy you've got it. Yup, lucky me. Here's Normy! Oh, no! Now, where's the artifact? Somewhere you'll never find it. You want it, don't you? Well, let's see how much. No! You wouldn't dare drop it. Hmm, you're right. But I'd sure throw it! No! Or pretend to anyhow. The old lemming dodge ball fake throw. Fooled by a stupid bear. Those sacks would make for a soft landing. Wind. Any landing's a good landing. Next stop, Beijing. Drop off the artifact to Chen at the university, then fly home in plenty of time for the Aurora Borealis and Grandpa's wedding. Never flew one these kinda copters before. But how hard can it be? Whoa! You three, now that you've cleared the area, I need you to smooth it out for a dance floor. Flat, but not slippery. Fong... Oh, I already know what my job will be. I will make a sculpture of the beautiful bride and groom. You can sculpt? That is how I earned a living while in business school. You know the Statue of Liberty? You sculpted that? Uh, no, but I could see it from my window - at business school. - Get Mr. Fong a block of ice to sculpt. Too messy and random. Make it neat and fancy. We're not barbarians after all. Chase, how is the music coming? Well, thanks to Mr. Fong, we got a whole human sound system set up. Check it out. I downloaded some majorly awesome beats. Huh? Oh, yeah! You feel me? I hate it. Too undignified. Hey, you lemmings have been pretty quiet lately. You just resting and enjoying the flight? Now, where can that university be? Hey. Excuse me, how do I get to the university? Study. Lots and lots of study. Hey, there it is. No wonder they call it an institution of higher learning, it's up on a hill. Hey, get it? Nothing, really? So, anybody know how to land this thing? I'll take that as a no. Ah, how hard could it be? We're good, we're good, we're good. Here we go. I'll just ease this baby down onto to the... Whoa! Everybody okay? Hmm? Huh? Now, in our study of archaeology, we've discussed many treasures, but this artifact is the most special of all. By placing the artifact in its sacred spot, one can gain access to the treasures housed within the Mountain of Nine Cauldrons for thousands of years. How come no one's ever seen these treasures? Nobody has seen them in your lifetime or mine, but that is about to change tonight. The ancient emperors used the magic of 17 sorcerers, so that the people would be able to gaze upon its contents just once every 100 years. For one day and night, from sunset to sunset, the mountain reveals the nine tripod cauldrons and all the other treasures of our ancestors. And the key to the mountain revealing itself is this artifact. So, where is the artifact now then? Well, it's been on display in a museum in Canada, but I have every confidence it will be back here before sunset. I know you'll make it back in time, Grandfather. I just know it. Huh? Uh, class dismissed. Oh, oh, pardon me. All right, let's scoot over here. Pardon me. You all right there? Oh, journey complete, lemmings. A king always keeps his word and we've delivered the artifact safe and... As I was saying, safe and sound. Ah! Professor Chen, I presume? No. My... Nobody named Chen. You must have the wrong classroom. Professor Chen, I will see you tomorrow. Hey, I get it, you don't get many talking polar bears around here. But relax, I have something for you. No, I don't want it. I want nothing from you. It's not from me, it's from your grandfather, Jin. My grandfather is nothing but an old fool. And a thief who steals artifacts. Now, please, go away. You got that wrong, your granddad's a good guy, but I tell you, there's this guy named Dexter, now, he's the real thief and a lowlife, a terrible guy. If you ever see him coming your way, cross the street, do not look back. Anyhow, I gave my word, so here. I have forgotten how beautiful it is. Isn't it, though? Allow me to introduce you to Chaos and Mayhem. - Komodo dragons. - Oh, yeah. I saw their baby pictures. They grow up so fast. Bravo. Oh, I say, you do know your reptiles. Then you're well aware that the Komodos are unabashed carnivores. Feeding on creatures as small as mice and as large as deer. Or even humans, for that matter. Yeah, well, not polar bears. No. Well, not yet anyway. They tend to live too far south to ever have encountered one. Oh, but Chaos seems rather interested in sampling a new dish. Mayhem, the artifact. I was trying to signal you to go away. Dexter had his weapon on me the whole time. No wonder you were acting all fidgety. I thought it was the bear thing. My Komodos will stay behind and keep you company. They have their instructions, one move and they attack. And you don't want that. Dexter, you and my grandfather were partners. You respected the world's artifacts. The treasures of the mountain belong to the people. And as I told your grandfather, I'm a people. And they will all be mine. Komodos... Fassen! Toodle-ooh. Dexter will head for the mountain and use the artifact to gain entry and rob it blind. Well, then we just got to stop him. How? Those are Komodo dragons and they mean business. They're deadly. Yeah, and they eat animals. Bet they never tasted anything as delicious as lemmings. They're so tender and tasty. They're both sweet and sour. Crispy on the outside, creamy on the inside. Woo! Way to go, lemmings. Log entry, saving and uploading. Lemmings! The river leads right to the Mountain of the Nine Cauldrons. Look, I've had no time to ask you, but my grandfather, why didn't he return the artifact himself? Oh, well, uh, that's because he was a little under the weather. Because of, uh, a cave-in, uh, mostly, and being trapped all night in the freezing cave and then he kind of passed out, so he might be unconscious or, uh, I don't know, um, in a coma? What? Will he make it? Sure he will. Ow, what? Oh. Hey. Ow! Cut it... Hmm, mm, oh. Mm. Oh, tasty. Huh? Wow! Woohoo! Hey there, little buddy. Oh, I see you brought your friends. Look! Dexter. I'm Norm. - No. I mean, look, Dexter. - Oh. Oh. Oh, I doubt we can beat him to the mountain. Not at this speed. Look out! I knew something bad must've happened. He made a sacred vow that he would bring the artifact back to Beijing, in time for the 100-year opening of the Mountain of the Nine Cauldrons. - He gave his word. - But then he made me give my word that I'd get the artifact to you if he couldn't, and I did. So it's kind of like him keeping his word. Sure, except that now Dexter has the artifact. And if it gets to the mountain before we do - and steals all its treasures... - That won't happen. When a king, that's me, gives his word, which I did, then nothing is gonna stop him. Except for maybe that! Look out! Look out! Look... Uncle Stan, you should be rehearsing the wedding song, not, uh... What are you doing anyway? Uh, gargling with ice water. It's good for my instrument. Fine. The rehearsal starts in 10 minutes. Oh, no! The only way to access the treasure is to land at its base and climb to the cavern opening. Then we can beat him there. Lemmings, do your thing. You can't run a boat on land, it has no wheels. The laws of physics make it impossible. I'm a king, I don't obey laws, I make them. Dexter's not gonna climb up to the cavern, he's gonna climb down to it. Climb aboard. He takes the high road, we take the low road. Hang on tight. Norm here. Norm, I forgot to ask, do you want iceberg lettuce salad, or cream of snow soup for your first course? Either one is fine. Why is your voice so weird? Probably bad signal on your mountain. Oh, hey, Norm, just FYI, the Aurora Borealis isn't too many hours away, and you need to get back, so I can get some footage of you and the happy couple just as it begins to rise in the background. Right, I'll do my best. Oh, we may have to post this wedding video online. Something tells me it's gonna be the Arctic Tundra's social event of the year. Uh, Mom, it's going to be the Arctic Tundra's only social event of the year. Even better, uh, signal's breaking up. Got to go. Again, the laws of physics. Physics shmysics. When you're a king, you make the rules. Norm, it's hideous. The most horrible thing ever. - What is? - Your brother Stan's singing. If you can call it that. It's indescribable. ♪ Give me a sign! ♪ That's Grandpa's favorite song. I can't believe Stan remembers the tune and all the lyrics. Tune? Lyrics? Seriously? How many times must I tell you, no phones! There's still work to do! Oh, for the love of... Wait, Norm. I just remembered something my grandfather told me. This corridor is protected by ancient booby traps. You sure? Then how did Dexter... Oh, oh, oh. Close. Too close, too close. Whoa. Oh! Okay, I think you're right about the booby-traps. Dexter knew how to avoid them. As would my grandfather. Uh, maybe Olympia can get him on the phone and, uh... Oh, no signal. Uh, uh, but, hey, a couple of smart guys like us, we can do this. It says, "Yin or yang, choose wisely." Huh. I think it means you either step only on the red stones - or on the blue stones. - Well, that narrows it down. Okay, so we've ruled out stepping on the red stones. Ipso facto, blue means go. No? Okay, no. I don't know, I'm okay. That was close. Oh, you know, I think that's it for the booby traps. Okay, so maybe not. Don't move. Oh, come on. Okay, that's it, right? Oh, Chen, bravo! You and your circus bear, managing to survive the traps. Circus bear? I'm sure that's an insult, - but I'm not sure why. - Don't do it, Dexter. My grandfather told me you were once an honorable and good man. Oh, yes. Good and poor. But then I saw the error of my ways. These silly antiquities are worth a fortune to collectors. So you sold out your partner, his entire country, and your principles - for a little money? - No, a lot of money. The treasures contained in this mountain are worth a fortune! Of course you remember Chaos and Mayhem. Hmm, seems that whatever you did to them earlier has made them eager - for some payback. - Wait, it won't work. It's not sunset, it's not time yet. Oh, on the contrary, it's the perfect time. You see, the mountain is already starting to glow, and that means it's right for the plucking. And there's nothing you can do to stop me. Oh, yeah? Oh, I should have mentioned, there's a trap or two that you missed. No. Huh? What is wrong with this thing? Maybe it needs new batteries. Wait. He's right. They're in ancient Mandarin. "Herein lie the Nine Cauldrons and the treasures of the ancient emperors. Their beauty to be gazed upon, but once every 100 years." All right. So open up and show me the beauty. You didn't read the fine print. What? This gibberish? It's the secret language of the ancient emperors themselves. I don't know that language. Ooh, sounds like someone wasn't paying attention in class that day. Mm-hmm. "The Nine Cauldrons represent honor, so to only a person of honor, in both word and deed, may access the treasure within the mountain." Your old-time emperors were just like ours. We always keep our word. Looks like you're out of luck, Dexter. Since you have no honor, the mountain has rejected you. But you, Chen, goody two-shoes, such a man of honor. Surely, it will open for you. Yeah, that's my phone. Uh, sorry, guys. I need to take this. Uh, hey. Hey. Uh, no. Uh, I really can't talk, but everything's... Ow. Sure doesn't sound like everything's okay. Tick tock, Chen, do it! No, I won't. - Good for you, Chen. - You're willing to give your life to deprive me of the treasure. On the other hand... Okay. This is weird. These big black metal pots. The Nine Cauldrons. Lost the signal. The Nine Cauldrons. The mountain is opening. And now all that treasure shall be mine. No, it won't. I made a promise to Chen that that would never happen. I gave my word! Chaos, Mayhem, attack! No! Oh, no. This isn't fair! I have buyers lined up for these treasures. I gave them my word. You respect that, right? My grandfather told me you're only as good as your word. But I guess that also means your word is only as good as you are. And you, Dexter, are not very good. Can't fool the mountain, it was built by emperors. And it looks like your ancient emperors are keeping their word. My grandfather will be very pleased. My grandfather won't be. Not if I don't get back to the North in time for his wedding. I gave my word. Oh, where is Norm? The wedding needs to start soon. Not to worry, I'm almost finished. Okay, everyone? Take your places. Chop chop, our guests are arriving. Come on, this is a happy occasion, a wedding. Why is everyone so down? Maybe it has something to do with you, Quinn. - And your bossiness. - Hey. Heavy is the head that wears the crown. And swollen is the head that let's power go to it, hmm? Yello. Norm, where are you? - Flying home. - You are? Well, I'm in Fong's chopper. Great, because the Aurora Borealis will be starting soon, and I can't stand any more of Quinn's bossiness, or any more of Stan's singing. Of course. I think this helicopter took a lot more damage than we think. Look out. Geese. Goose. Whoa! Well, well, the nerve. Geese have the right-of-way, thank you. So much for the windshield wipers. Can't see a thing. Lemmings, need your help. Oh, look how much cleaner it is. It's not clean, it's gone. Still, you got to admit that it's a lot easier to see. Those clouds, that mountain... Mountain? Here we go. Good as new, eh? You're gonna have to step on the gas. How fast are we going? Speedometer is broken, but I'd say pretty fast. We're not even flying at goose speed. - We gotta go faster. - Okay, but I'm not sure the helicopter can take it. Norm, everybody is getting nervous. You need to be here. - Are you okay? - Yes, I'm fine. Uh, not you, Chen. - Who's Chen? - I'm, uh... Vision's a little blurry, but I'm not sure - if I can still... - Fear not. I'll take over. That's what I'm saying. You need to get here and take over. Uh, okay. I'm on my way. - Okay. No, I got this. - What's going on? Okay. Just need to really put on the gas. Punch bowl needs a refill. Mm-hmm. Wedding singer, in place. Maria, Chase, stand over there to greet and see any late comers. With pleasure, Your Heinie-ness. Boy, will I be glad when dad's back and Quinn's demoted back down to dumb older brother. I heard that! What's wrong? I think we're running out of gas. Come on. Come on! So, what's the backup plan if Norm doesn't show up in time? There is no backup plan. Norm gave his word, he will be here... I hope. Oh, I suppose I could edit the video to make it look like he was here. Mom, forget the video, an Aurora Borealis can last as little as 10 minutes. The wedding ceremony has to begin, like, now. Well, what are we waiting for? Let's get you two lovebirds hitched. And by the power vested in me as King of the North, I, Norm, pronounce you two bear and wife. Now, plant one on her, Grandpa. Oh, they're such a beautiful couple. ♪ Such a beautiful bear ♪ ♪ Such beautiful fair ♪ ♪ Her eyes glow like glaciers ♪ ♪ When I look at her ♪ Well, it was kind of touch and go there for a while, but I made it back in time and kept my word. You certainly did. And you even brought my grandson to this joyous occasion. You are truly a great king, and have honored the great emperor's China with what you have done. Thank you, and as King, I have something to say to my subjects. Attention, everyone, King Norm has a royal pronouncement. Let's get this party started! We're running low on salmon. You're not in-charge anymore. You want fish... then go fish, your former highness. Heavy is the head that wears the crown. Or the bucket. Sure am proud of my grandson. I know what you mean. I'm proud of mine as well. Come on, Dad, show us some moves. Go Norm, go Norm, go Norm, go Norm, go Norm, go Norm, go Norm, go Norm, go Norm... Shaking it, shaking it. Watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out, there it is! Watch it go, watch it go, watch it go, watch it go, look out, ooh, ha! I'm King of the North. Proud, but sometimes a little embarrassed.
