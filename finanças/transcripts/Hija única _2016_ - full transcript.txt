In 1589, Michel de Montaigne asked himself how a drop of semen could carry within it the resemblance between father and child. He found it amazing. ONLY CHILD -At what time are we doing the keys? -Whenever you want. Everything's ready. -Do you want to go now? -No... -Let's go to the cemetery first. -Okay. I want to say hello to Marta. Just because she's dead doesn't mean she has spare time. When we left to New York, I was ten years old, right? Or nine? Ten, yes. It's been ten years since I last came here. I'd need to spend a year in one of these places to see where I feel like a foreigner. Did you know that, since you left, mom hasn't spoken in Spanish? Not one word. Not even with me, nothing. Not even to cuss about me? I don't know. I guess one can only talk about you in Spanish. So she hasn't said anything. What about him? One can't talk about him in any language. You do know something about him. No, Delfi. Not me nor anybody. Guille, is that house abandoned? I look more and more like her, don't I? You look just like her. Notary, how are you? Delfi! Good morning. Hello. Good morning. Come on, we have to go. Are we going to the theater? No, now you are going to school. The theater is still a while away. I'll have to leave the car at the airport again. But I think I'll be home for dinner. -Will you wait for me? -Yes. Thank you. I got the tickets. -For what? -She's excited, aren't you? Yes. About what? The Magic Flute. She's obsessed with the story. She asked me to tell it to her 1000 times. Isn't that right? The story... But I don't remember it. Why don't you tell it to her? I told her the story many times, didn't I? Who's your favorite character? The queen of the night? Yes, and I also like Pamina. You do? I also like Pamina. Listen, love, you have to remember to pick up Delfi from school today. Okay. -Sure? -Sure! You won't forget, will you? Delfi, that chicken will stay in the car, okay? The teacher doesn't want you to take toys to school, she's said it many times. It's a bird, mom. And it's a girl bird. Stop calling it a chicken. I called it a bird, right? Or did I say chicken? What did I say? Chicken? I don't know. That's between you two. -No, I called it a bird! -You called it a chicken. The heart of every great movie is always a mistake. When do you write these things, Juan? What about you? When do you get your genius ideas about doors and locks? Throw this notebookay away, Juan. I don't know, we keep going in circles. Why does this guy have to do such an effort to change his identity if he can continue to do all the same shit with the Atlanta member card, for example. That's the way movies are. I don't understand why we have to make a movie based on invented hypotheses. The last movie we did was identical, it was exactly the same. We worked along the same lines and the ideas were ours. Or will you tell me those were her ideas? Okay, we are not scientists. She also wasn't... -What? -The Turkish from the stories. -Sherezade? -That one. Are you going to get that? Come on, answer it, you're not going to think up anything! Hello? What are you doing? What happened? Wait, calm down. Yes, calm down. Wait. Okay. He's here, bye. -It's your wife. -What does she want? Apparently, there was a... I don't know, apparently there was a small accident with... -What accident? -...Delfina. With Delfina? Apparently nothing happened, Juan! Stop! Wait, I'll take you. Come. Okay. Come on, come on! Ceci, what happened? Where is Delfina? Please enter the room properly and then we'll talk. Cecilia, where is Delfina? Please. What happened? Can you tell me? Please, Juan! Oh, I can't believe this. Come in. What happened? -Sit down, please. -That's not necessary, come on. Yes, I wanted to talk to you. The teacher was telling them that one of the girls' mother fell through the elevator shaft and that's why the girl isn't coming to school. Okay. I'm really sorry about this lady's death. What happened to my child? I never said she was dead. Did I? Without a word, Delfina went to sit down at the other girl's desk. There was no way to convince her to go back to her seat. Now, she's saying she's her. Look at these drawings. She started drawing them in art class when she found out about you changing your last name. But it's weird because there's a theme with mothers. Look, two different moms... It's as if she's processing your issue in a world of women, you know what I mean? Remember that the child psychologist and I recommended that you wait a while before telling her about the last name change? Yes. There's your dad, come on. Hello, sweetie. Hi! -Are you okay? -Hi, how are you doing? That sweater belongs to the other girl. The one whose mom fell down the elevator. She didn't want to take it off. Lucía? Why are you wearing this? Is it wrong? No. The only one who ever took that bullshit seriously is Martin. Well, Federico would have gone crazy anyway. With or without the book. -It's like that, it's hereditary. -How did Federico take it? Juan... Thank you. My love, sometimes it's important. I know. You're right. Please, you have to pick up when I call you. I'm begging you, Juan. I'm sorry. It's okay. But somebody always picks up anyway, right? Sometimes I don't know who you are. Of course, I changed my name. I don't know if we handled it right, this last name thing. Can you tell me what happened at school? Nothing happened. It wasn't that serious. What do you mean it wasn't that serious? She said she had a different name. She put on another girl's clothes. Do you think that's just a coincidence? No, not a coincidence. Look, dad! It's grandma! No, Delfi, sweetie. That's not your grandmother. Come over here! She's one of Dad's friends. Juan, can you help me, please? This girl doesn't even know her own name. -She doesn't know who's who. -I'll take her to bed now. She fell asleep, Lidia. Aww, what a pity. What a beautiful photo! So cute. It's beautiful. It's lovely, I love it. I took it last week. Lovely. I've been calling you all day. But your phone was off. The verdict is in. Yes, you don't like it, I know. Lawyers will handle everything. Thank you. No need to thank me. Your grandma's lawyers are your lawyers too. I don't know. What should I do? Take possession, what else can you do? The house is yours. If it's not yours, it's nobody's. And you have to think about Delfi. She looks so beautiful in that photo! Beautiful, I love it. Take it. -Really? -Sure. -With the frame and all? -Of course. Thank you. I've been thinking about the future. I will create a new drugstore, a new drugstore concept. And what is this new concept about? It's a drugstore that's as much a drugstore as it can be. It's called a "maxi-drugstore." There are no drugstores here. How so? Yes, someone ran out of cigarettes today and found no-- Yes, you need cigarettes: bam! You go to the drugstore. Bam! You go to the drugstore. Now they don't serve you through a window anymore. When I was a kid, I had to order through a window. I had to look up and tell the guy what I wanted. He had everything I liked at the bottom and at the top was everything my dad liked. Well, whatever, the one who was like my dad. Considering that there's been no tribute to me in your movies, one in the "maxi-drugstore" could be a good idea, right? For example, I'm thinking of this name... "Completely Berenice drugstore." That's good. It's pretty original, in fact. Ah! I'm exhausted. -It was nice today, wasn't it? -Very nice. -We had a good time. -Yes. We are old enough to handle it, but she is a kid. And I don't know if she understands. I think Delfi will be okay. You think so? Lidia says I need to take charge of the ranch. That lawyers say it's the best option... and that I have to do it. She's right. Maybe. Of course. You already won the trial. You have to go. It's your property. It's nobody's but yours. Lidia is right. -You have to go there-- -I have nothing there. At least think about me, or about Delfi. I don't know... besides, I want you to be okay. I feel like this has upset you. You have to move forward. And it wouldn't be too bad to have a ranch. You can even give it to me as a gift. I give it to you. You can give it to me. -Or a drugstore. -No, a ranch. A maxi-ranch? A maxi-ranch or a ranch with a maxi-drugstore. What do you mean "Juan"? What is this, Ezequiel? I don't know, that's what they say. But since when do they... What is all of this? What is going on? I'm going to go away for a while. Where are you going? To a town, close to a river. What about your sisters or your...? Well, take care of them. They have just one mother. I also took care of you, didn't I? I am your mom The family of my dad lives in that town. Apparently, I was born and raised there... until they took me away at the age of three, didn't you know that? No, I didn't know. I didn't know anything. That doesn't matter, I'm your mom. Don't you remember I was afraid of the river? I used to dream about that. You used to have a nightmare about the ocean. There will be an exhumation. -Is that how you say it? -I don't know... It's the body of a man. Apparently, he was called Juan, like me. Why would we tell you? What would we say? With what purpose? You were here. Were you okay? And your filmmaking career, everything you... What will you do now? We've already paid for three years. The same thing that happened with the piano, mom. I don't know. -I don't know. -Ah? I don't know. I present you to Juan. Juan. Juan? Oh, yes, I'm sorry. I'm not used to that name yet. I'm your cousin, Guillermo. The black sheep of the family. Until now that you are back. You've made a big mess, haven't you? These are the town's first dead. Englishmen. They are the ones who built the railroad. Not even the priest showed up. They could have had some folklore, at least. Your old man had a ranch. Everything was divided up. And then, one day... the real owner appeared. Have you noticed that at some point, when you have the same dream over and over, it's like you're not dreaming anything at all. I sometimes dream in chapters. Apparently, I was around two when they took me to live with them. The birthdate on my identity card... is that day, the day they took me. That means I'm two years older... than what I thought. I blew so many candles celebrating the day I was kidnapped. That's crazy, dude! Look. This is my mom, apparently. She was pretty. Dolores. I didn't remember. When I would write scripts at university... I would always think of a woman. It was always the same face of the same woman. Then, when they showed me her photo, I realized it was her. -Movie scripts? -Yes. Ah... I like that. I studied in Buenos Aires too. I was told you're staying for a few days. Yeah, I don't know, maybe. Do you want to go out tonight? Come on! She was locked up. She had been locked up by a man, in a palace. But he wasn't a bad man. He had locked her in there because he didn't want her to be with her mom. And why didn't he want her to be with her mom? Because he thought that she wasn't the best mom for her. And what do you think? What's going on? Nothing. That you are beautiful. It's a Wolfgang Amadeus Mo... Mozart's musical. The Magic Flute. A little fairy tale in which the young prince Tamino will have to-- Young prince? Will have to rescue Pamina, daughter of the queen of the night, who was kidnapped by mean Sarastro. -Sarastro? -Sarastro. -Sarastro! -Sarastro! -Sarastro! -Sarastro! In the beginning, we will see the young prince Tamino being chased by a terrible snake. Where is the snake? Snake! Tamino is in danger! We need to save him! Die monster! By our power! We've freed him! A nice teenager. He is young and beautiful! There will never be another like him! If love touched my heart, this young man would be of my choice. No, he is mine. And that's final. He is mine! I saw him first. I don't care, pudding face! Tamino, our queen is asking you to go on a very important mission. Open the box. It contains a portrait of her daughter, Pamina. She's beautiful! So beautiful! Oh, if I could find her! I can't explain this feeling. Is this love? Yes, Tamino, it's love. Wake up! You must leave right away. Yes, it's love! My daughter Pamina has been kidnapped. Pamina? -Are you a warrior? -Yes! Are you brave? Ah... yes, I'm brave. You'll save her. Say yes! Say yes! My little daughter Pamina, I can't protect you. Sarastro took my power away. Tamino was also fooled by him and, with sunlight, he will be one of them. I love that prince. I love him, with all my heart. Oh little daughter, you are confused. Listen, revenge gods, to this, a mother's oath. Can you go faster so that...? No, with the head... I get more wind. Juan? Say hi! Hi. -Please. -Hi. Hi, Juan. How do you do both things at the same time? I'm a genius. You're very smart? Am I very cute? Very smart. Very cute, also. You're very cute. What? You're very cute. Come, come. Let me introduce you to my cousin. Come on. Juan. Did you get it? -It doesn't matter. -She's not for me. -Cheers. -Cheers. What's your name? -Martina -Martina? And you? I've got many names. You can call me Juan. -Okay, Juan. -Yeah. -"One moment" what? Come here! -One moment. Come here. Stop, stop. Okay. Are you okay? -What do you mean? -It was me who threw the cup. -What? -That I threw the cup. Oh, yes, I'm okay. And you? Are you okay? -Yes. -It's done. -I'm sorry. -I'm fine. I did it on purpose anyway. What planet are you from? From upstairs. I live upstairs. -You do? -Yes. -Is it nice? -It's cool. Yes. -And can I? -What? -Live. -With me? Maybe. -But first you have to dance with me. -Okay. -Where? -There. Do you want to leave with me? Okay. Do you want to come to my hotel? No. So where? -Let's go to my place. -Right now? Let's go. -Is there anybody here? -My mom's here. ...and the studies done suggest that life experiences also have chemical effects in the DNA. We are completely aware that proof is not sufficiently strong yet so as to prove this hypothesis. We know it, but there exists what we call an epigenetic change. That means that the gene was chemically marked as a response to a traumatic experience and that change is transmitted to our kids and grandkids. Remember a traumatic experience doesn't necessarily have to be negative. It could be a unique experience, like a strong romantic connection. Any facts or people can leave marks in us. There are studies that show that the life experiences of the parents can chemically alter the body and be transmitted to their children. In fact, research being done in Germany on the last few years has to do with this. It has to do with grandchildren of Holocaust victims. Their testimonies give an account of an emotional, historic memory of a period they didn't live but, still, appears on their bodies, in their voices, in their memories. For people listening from different places, they look surprised, having to re-explain the evidence and hypotheses. Don't worry about the faces. You need help, right? -We always need help. -Well... Here I am. Let's see. What is this? Look. First piece of information: There's more than 20 years difference between them. But what's the relationship between them? None. Well, unless you discover the opposite. Where did you get this, Lidia? Second piece of information: Delfina was born several years after Julia's death. Think about that... Are you okay? Give me your hand. No one lives here, right? Delfi, be careful. Be careful, Del. This place is amazing. Look at this house. It doesn't make you want to own it? And who would manage it? You, of course. Good afternoon. How are you, Juan? -How are you? -Good. -How are you, counsellor? -Good afternoon. Sit down, please. -Feel right at home. -Yes, of course. It's about to be your home, right? But, well... We are not on the best of days. So, what I wanted to ask you-- Juan, can you put down the book please? Thank you. I was going to ask you... to please let us lawyers do the talking, okay? If you said something wrong, we could lose control of the situation again. Wrong? I don't understand. Well... I am your lawyer. It's just a piece of advice. Yes, but can't we speak? Can't I speak? Look, dad! No, that's not what I mean. What I mean is... I am just your adviser. You take your own decisions. Okay, could you tell them to come in, please? I've had a four-hour long trip to get here and it'll be another four hours to get back. So let's move forward. Sure, of course. Excuse me. The character in this book is called Juan, like me. It's a kid. They call him "young master." Isn't it funny? "Young master"? Don't you want to try it? -You are torturing me. -I was Ezequiel, now I'm Juan. I can be young master. Try it, "Young master." Delfi, do you want to play outside? -Yes. -Yes? Go. Okay, we may start talking. Well, good afternoon. Mr. Isidoro Carrasco. His representative, Mr. Juan Carrasco. Well, as you might imagine... -Just for the record... -Let me do the talking. I'm here against my will. Okay, I'm sure you understand this is a-- Excuse me, it's not necessary. I'm also here against my will. Listen, Juan... I just wanted to make that clear. Counsellor, do you realize what you just said? My grandfather and I are here against our will. Shouldn't you invite us to leave? He won't leave. He's just curious. He asks out of curiosity. He's very sensitive. He's a film director, an artist. Isn't that right, Juan? You are free to leave whenever you want. Doctor... Shall we start? Can we start talking? No. Considering I have that freedom, I'll use it. I'm leaving. Just a minute. -Juan... -Just a minute. We may start. It's unrelated that my client doesn't want to take possession. -It's a matter regarding the law. -But... -You must comply with the law. -We have the obligation to represent. -What's going to happen? -We've been giving him too much time. What's going to happen? What? You're being inflexible. You're being inflexible, Nacho! -You have to convince your client-- The grandmother will have to deal with it? -How is that related to anything? -What do you mean? I'll deal with it! -I'm here to explain the situation-- -Son of... really? Well... I understand you're lawyers... That you profit from being here many hours, right? You charge by the hour. Don't worry, we'll pay. We all know how this movie ends, don't we? It is res judicata. So, considering the amount of hours that we've been here... I'll leave and will come back when this story ends. Okay. Do you want to continue? Catch me if you can, mom. Delfi! I hurt myself! Delfi! Oh, your finger, Delfi! It's orange. Oh yes, her little finger is orange! Did it hurt? -No. -No? What about the shot? -It didn't hurt either. -I'm glad. -How did you get this, Delfi? -I don't know. What do you mean you don't know, Delfina? -What's your name? Delfina? -Delfina. Did it hurt? Excuse me. Why don't you go do the paperwork while I cure your daughter? Stay here, please. I'm going to do the paperwork and I'll be back, okay? -Does this hurt? -A little bit. -A little bit, yes... -I repeat, Dr. Locket to surgery. They're always calling me. Look what they've made me do... -Doctor, please it's urgent. -I know it's urgent, it always is. They're waiting for you in the operating room. You found me. I will always find you. Show me your finger. What a pity! Such a lovely finger! It will heal very soon. You have such beautiful hands! They look like mine. Look, do you know what a secret is? Do you like it? It's for you. This will be a secret between us two. You can't tell anybody, ever. Nobody, not even your mom. Will you keep it forever? You must always have it close to you. EXIT What are you doing here, Delfi? I don't know, mom. I was looking for you. The doctor had to leave. What do you mean? Where did he go? I don't know. Let's go home. I don't know what's going on here. I don't understand a thing. Isn't it too close to the river? It's close. I'm not so sure about this place... Look, there is no electricity. I can live with candles. You're beautiful. I like this one better than the last one. -Are you going in? -Into the little house. It's the little house. When will you pick up your stuff? Never. Wow! What is this bed? I can't believe the old man has this bed. What are you doing? Look, I don't know why I remember this book... Have you read it? -Read it. -No way. Come on, read it. Yes, take it. I don't want to. You've got homework: First, read it... and then tell me about it. -No way. -Yes. You'll tell me if you liked it or not, and why. You're pissing me off, you know? It's what you got. I won't do it! I'm telling you. "The story takes place in Junín or Tapalqué." You will. No. Yes. "A boy disappeared after an Indian raid. They said indigenous people took him. His parents searched for him fruitlessly. Over the years, a soldier came from far away and told them about a blue-eyed native who could be their son. They finally found him. The chronicle lost its circumstances and I don't want to make up what I don't know. They thought they recognized him. The man... as a consequence of the desert and the barbaric life, could no longer understand the words of his mother tongue. But he allowed himself to be driven, indifferently, to his house. He stopped there. Maybe because the others also stopped. He looked at the door, as if he didn't understand it. He suddenly looked down... He screamed, running through the hallway along the two patios, and got into the kitchen. Without hesitation, he put his arm up the blackened bell and took the knife that he had hidden there as a child. His eyes shone with joy and his parents cried, because they had found their son." Do you want me to continue? "Other memories followed this one. But the Indian couldn't live between walls, and one day he went back looking for his desert. I'd like to know how he felt in that instant of vertigo, in which past and present got mixed up. I'd like to know if the lost son was reborn and died in that rapture or if he recognized, at least as a child or a dog, -his parents and the house." -...his parents and the house. -What can we take from here? -Nothing. Isn't that what we came for? -Nothing. -Why nothing? Everything's horrible. Oh, there is something. Wait. -Do you think this works? -Yes. We can put it there, look. By the window. Does that seem good? Here? Perfect. We'll need a wire. There's a plug right there. But it won't reach. Let's see... -Juan? -What? Are you coming? I want to give you something. What? A kiss? Happy birthday. What is this? -Today is your birthday. -Is it? Really? Happy birthday. Look, it's me. And this was written by my mom. I've got a present for you. -Do you? -Yes. What? Look. -What are you doing with this? -I brought it. It's my mom's. Well, I brought it for you. -She lent it to me. -Did she? Yes, look... It belonged to my great-grandmother... well, and to my grandmother. To all of them. And now? Now it's mine. Oh, I love it! Oh! Stop. Stop! Don't look at me that way. -Don't look at me that way! -Stop it, you. I love you. -Again. -What? I love you. I love you again. There you go. I was thinking of dying my hair brunette. You like blondes anyway, right? It would look good on you. How did you come up with...? The other day, I watched some tapes of Julia. It had been a while... like ten years. I had the urge. It will sound stupid, but... I felt she was watching me. Look, look ahead. Why aren't you wearing your seatbelt, Juan? In case I want to get out of here. Say hi. Come on. No, with your head. Like this? Can you go faster so that... -Do you know this girl? -What? I'm looking at photos. -What? -Do you know this girl? Why? Here's another one. Where did you get this from? Do you know her or not? Were they together for a long time? I think it's a girl from town. -I think so, I don't know. -You think? -Do you have more photos? -You think? You think she's from town? Well, yes, I remember now! -There's Juan... -Okay, but if I don't see him... And who's that woman over there? What woman? The one with the black dress. This one. Oh, right. Right Everything's falling into place now, right? -It's been ages! She's her mother... -Whose mother? This girl's mom... I don't even remember her name. -Who is this girl? -It's a girl from town. Were they together for a long time or not? Why don't you ask him? Was she pretty? I don't know, like in pictures... Was she pretty or not? -You are covering for him. -No, I'm not. Go and ask him! -No, no. I want to ask you! -Go and ask him! Hello! -What's up Julia? -You got here right on time. -For what? -To lend us some money. What were you going to pay with? No, we've got something. With Juan's camera. -What's up, cousin? -I'm good. -I haven't seen you in two weeks. -Yes... -How are you? -Good. -Here. -Thank you. You look good. What's up? Do you like this one, sweetheart? -Yes. And the other one too? -Both? Yes. Are you going back to Buenos Aires, sweetheart, or staying? I don't know. No... I don't know I'm figuring it out. I might go back to the movie thing. And the family? Good, and yours? A few months later, the girl is at a bar and... -Yes. -A little girl in a bar? And the eight year old girl meets up with other girls at the corner. And she observes them for a moment: how they speak, how the little girl moves. She looks at her moving, laughing, how she talks to her friends, until suddenly a van appears, like a school van. -They go to the bar? -She gets in the van and leaves. -No, Juan! Listen, it's very simple. -She goes to school. -She's normal. -A 20-year old guy, parents are divorced. The mother lives in the city and the father lives here. -He visits every five or six months. -Guillermo, listen-- -To see his dad. -He has a friend, they meet up at noon. -Julia. The 17-year old girl, who is now a bit older, is in a bar and sees the same little girl who was eight or nine years old. A guy goes to a bar, he meets this girl, thinks she is cute, shows her to his friend, that's it. -Understand? -Okay? The day after that, he's with his friend and they see the girl. -Yes. -But she's with her mother. Wait, this is the girl you liked yesterday. I don't understand what you're saying. If you make those kind of movies, I won't go see them. They are terrible. I've got one that I like better. Do you want me to tell it to you? -Okay. -Come on. It's a story that my mom used to tell me. She said it was a real story. But I think that it was her story. In fact, there are things I remember... but I don't think I lived those moments, she made them up. Yes, it's good. It's a good story. What I don't get is what the fuck are you doing here. And you? The screenplay structure needs some organization. But... it's possible, but not here. I think what we are writing with Guillermo is pretty good. Do you? He wants us to go to Buenos Aires for a few weeks, maybe two or three. Perhaps we can get them to lend us the cameras from university. -What university? -My university. I'm thinking we could film some kind of sample of the movie, or... Do you feel like it? -Feel like what? -Like coming with us. No, why would I go? I have nothing to do with it. -It's yours as well. -It's not mine. I have nothing to do with your life over there, or with that movie. You have a lot to do with it, and I love you and I need to do it with you. Come on, I also left a lot back there. -Did you? -Yes. And here you aren't? You know what? You can't be two people. Having two lives is not possible. Nor can you be nobody all the time. -What do you want to be? Famous? -What? Is that what you want? I thought we were exactly the same. Careful! Hi, what are you looking for? I'm looking for my daughter. Who is your daughter? Delfina Carrasco. Right! She left with her grandmother. What grandmother? Marta. -Guille! -Marta! Stop! It's him. Juan. Marta! Julia. That day she got sun burned. She was three years old here. That was in the garden, her birthday. They gave her that dog. She slept with the dog for a month, it was gross! Where is that dog now? Hi. Hi. You arrived right on time. Hello, sweetheart. Are you okay? Oh, the first day of kindergarten! And here with her braids, making a Swiss roll. With the braids that look so cute on you. -Where did we take this picture? -Mar del Plata, remember? Who is this? Who could it be? But don't throw the photo at him, please. This is Mar del Plata. -It's Julia. -Yes. -Is it Julia? You look like her. -Drop it. She's identical, isn't she? She looks just like her. Yes, exactly like her. -Exactly like who? -You look exactly like Julia. Who is Julia? -Julia... -She's identical, they look alike. I'll tell you who she is later. The braids look so beautiful! Will you tell her later? Where's the car? Where is it? Calm down, Bere. Calm-- -Where's the car? No. -Calm down. Drop it. What do you mean calm down? Let me go! Where's the car? -Where's the car? -Calm down! -Stop. Come here. -I won't calm down! I want the car! -The car is over there, wait. -Let me go, I want the car. -I want to go! -Wait a second. Calm down, come on. Where's the car? Where's the car! -Berenice, why don't you calm down? -No, no! -I don't want to calm down. Let me go. -Let's go. Leave me alone. -Yes, you are delirious. -I am delirious? Julia died five years before Delfina was born And what do I care! You carried her for nine months, you gave birth to her. It's on tape! You did love her. And every time you slept with me... you were thinking of her. -Enough! Stop it, Bere. -Let me go! Who do you think you are to touch me? Let me go! I want the car right now. Is it true that I'm pretty? Or was it all lies? You are beautiful. Come here, Delfi. Don't get angry, mommy. I know I've never been to Mar del Plata. You are the mother. Can't you see? She has no doubts about it. Delfina is my daughter. My daugther... and Julia's. What a look that woman gives her! Did you notice, Juan? Her eyes sparkle when she looks at her! Like she was her grandmother... Let's go, okay? It's starting to get cold, let's go. Come, Delfi. With time... she will look like Julia more and more. -I love you. -Me too. They always thought our biological parents are not our only parents. But I couldn't say anything until you figured it out yourself, Juan! Okay, Lidia, it's done. So what? Get it, Juan. Delfina has two mothers. That's crazy talk, Lidia. Are you listening to yourself? It makes no sense. They were quite shocked with the photos. What photos? The photos of Delfi and Julia at the same age. -The photo I gave you. -Yes, that one. Unbelievable. Juan! Am I a lab rat? That's what I was, what I am now and what I'll always be? Who do you think you are! You're welcome. Send us a gift when you can. You'll take care of that kid. -Yes, thanks a lot. -Listen to me, Juan! You will take care of her because Delfi is not Julia. Julia is dead. She's not coming back. But Delfi is your daughter. You will take care of her. You will donate your inheritance to her. If the mother asks for sole custody, you'll give it to her. And you'll take care of her. If you can't, stay away! I'll take care of that. Are you listening, Juan? Yes. On 5th February, in the city of La Plata, three identical copies, each of which shall be deemed an original, are signed. And afterwards what? Mr. Juan Carrasco hereby donates the property with the aforementioned cadastral data to his daughter Delfina. Without prejudice to this, a lifetime usufruct is created by law in favor of Mrs. Marta Vidal. This means, excuse me, that you can use the ranch as you see fit. Seeing that Delfina, the new owner as from today, won't be able to dispose of the property for as long as you live. Only on the day of your passing, which God and all of us hope is very far away, will she be able to take possession. Marta... It's the family house, I can't take care of it. On this side? Here? Okay Delfina, now you will sign these three copies. -You can do it there on the side. -Okay. Very good. Now we can hand you the key. -They are yours. -Thank you.
