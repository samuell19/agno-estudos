[Woman] Things was different back in 1935. It was hotter, for one thing, and we didn't have TV neither. Nobody had discovered them yet. My mamma and daddy lost about everything, but we didn't give up. No, sir. That's the way we were brought up, I guess. The way we figured it, if we hung on and gave it everything we got, things would get better. And we were wrong about that, but so were a lot of people back then. I'll never forget those days-- how wonderful it was to be alive, to be young. The common fella didn't have a chance. Big oil took over everything, but they weren't the ones that built the business. They just grabbed the apples. And that's what they were--grabbers. It was the catters that made the business-- the wildcatters-- men like my father, men like h.L. Hunt, dad joiner, and Teddy coon. Everybody knows about them. But then there was Mr. Cox. Now, Mr. Cox was something else. [Chuckles] Some of the catters were just born to be lucky. Mr. Cox... Now, he was just lucky to be born. Captioning made possible by Warner Bros. [Tries to start car] [Cat meowing] All right. All right. All right. All right. O.k. Oh... [Cat meows] O.k., o.K. [Cough] All right. Let's go. Let's get out of here. Let's go, kitty cat. Let's go. [Meow] [Meow] [Meow] Hop in. Where you headed? Oh, big stone. Hoo-whee! Would you look at this place? Thank you very much. Ma'am. Well, see you around, kid. Yes, sir. Hey, here! Hey, hey! All right! Hold it! One at a time, damn it! You, what's your age? What? What's your age? How old are you? 21. More like 51. And a crip to boot! It don't take five digits to be a tool dresser. [Contractor] It does for me. Hey!hey! Hey!hey! Hit him hard! Get him! Hit him! Yeah! Uh! Oh! Whoo-hoo! Uh! Oh! Hit him hard! Hit him hard! Come on. Get lost, will you? What did he say? Who? Mac Holland? Yes, Mac Holland. Son of a gun wouldn't allow me past the gate. That is it. I can't believe you no more. You are always talking about how you made him rich. The way I hear it, he chased you off with a gun. I heard that a Derrick that you built fell in and nearly killed the man. That could have happened to anybody. That could have happened to anybody? When we lost our bit in crystal, you said, "that happens all the time." Our rig freezes up, and you say, "that could happen to anybody." I have been through hurricanes and fires, shaft cave-ins, and it don't happen to everybody. Seymour, what you fail to realize is you're a whiner. You're a whiner and a complainer. As far as I'm concerned, me and Matilda can just do fine by ourselves. Oh, yeah? That's another thing. You spent $20 on that damn oil-smelling cat. That thing couldn't smell her food if you stuck it up its nose with a stick. I have been made a fool of long enough. Only thing I got left is that car. Believe me-- I'm using it to get far away from you. All I want to hear out of you is where you parked my car. Sure. Sure. Sure. You just go left on pickett street, and you'll come to it. Very good. Ooh, good luck, buddy. You're going to need it. In about 40 miles. [Knock on window] No noise. No liquor, no foul language. Your cat starts anything, you both go. 75 cents. Tell you what. All right. Double or nothing, all right? Oh, damn. Come on, baby. Let's go. Come on, baby. O.k. Still playing the cards, huh, Mr. Cox? What? Ha ha ha! Henry. Well, then. I heard you hit the big one down in the basin-- you and Dave mcdermit. Mcdermit-- that son of a bitch-- he cheated me out of every dime that was coming to me. Worst mistake I ever made in my life, hooking up with that guy. I'm sorry to hear that. I really am. Yeah. I'm all washed up. Finished. You'll be back in it, Henry. You don't give up easy. I'm an old man, broke as the day I was born. I got me a ride back to California in the morning. I have only one thing left to do, and that's dying. I want to do that with my family. Don't talk like that. You're not dying. You're living. We're all dying, all of US. You're not dying. Good night, Mr. Cox. [Cat meows] Hey, delbert! Hey, Henry. Here's an old friend of mine-- Mr. Cox. Sure, I remember you-- back in crystal. You're the one lost your bit 1,600 feet down. That's a tough piece of luck. Henry tells me you're headed for California. Yeah. Sure. Sure. Hey, what the hell. Toss your stuff in. You going for business or pleasure? Well, eh... Take a little rest, I guess. Might look into the real-estate game. Damn sweet racket, I hear. Yeah. We'll see. [Delbert] Real estate, huh? Yeah. California, here we come, boys. Uh, let's see, delbert. Make a left here. Yeah. That will take US out of town. [Horn honks] I'm going to stretch my legs a bit. Sure. Sure. No hurry here. [Meow] [Man] How you all doing? [Delbert] Doing all right. Check the oil for you? Please do. [Attendant] Fine-looking automobile you got. Yeah. They don't make them like this anymore. Nice day. Dry, though. Yeah. Oil's good. Get that windshield for you. Thank you. [Sniffing] You smell it? Do you smell that? [Meow] Act like nothing's going on. [Meow] [Sniff] Lord. [Sniff] Lord. Henry! Henry! Henry! Henry! Come here a minute. I want to show you something. Come on. Come on. Wait a minute. Come on. Now we, my friend, are standing on top of the biggest anticline you ever heard of. I can smell it, Henry. I--i can smell it so big it almost knocks me off my feet. Oh, no, no, no, no. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Other people have tried it before. I drill one not 3 miles from here. Well, you just grabbing at straws. [Horn honks] Let's go, boys. Hold on. Wait a minute. Hold on here. I need a partner here, partner-- somebody I can trust, and that's you. You cannot stay here. What are you going to do? Hey, I mean, I'm a doodlebug man. I'm going to find the window, Henry. I'm going to bring it on in. That's what i'm going to do. This is your chance, too--you and me. Stay with me. Stay close, Henry. No. Stay with me, Henry. Stay with me. Come on. Good luck, Mr. Cox. I'll pray for you. Yes, sir. I'm coming. What the heck's going on, Henry? Suitcase! [Henry] Crazy old coot. O.k. He's not coming. [Car starts] You take care, now. Bye, Mr. Cox. Good luck! Exactly where are we? Henrietta's about a mile that way. Henrietta. Henrietta, Oklahoma. Henrietta, Texas. Yes, sir. I know it well. Now, let's see. Henrietta. Clay county. Wichita county. Now... Yes, no, or maybe? Yes. Northeast more. Yes. Yes. Wichit-- yes. Yes. Yes. You got a pencil? Yes. Yes. Yes. There. Where? Right there. That's it. [Meow] Yes, sir. That's it. Howdy. Can I help you? Nope. You all right there? Fine. Fine. What you doing? Uh, just doodling. Doing what? Just go on about your business. I'm sure you got plenty to do. O.k., o.K. Don't tell me that fellow wasn't nosy. Daddy! You being a good girl? How did it go in town? I don't want to talk about it. Here, sugar. [Baby crying] [Whimper] It's o.K., puppy. [Girl] Pauline, come here. Here, pauline. Catch the ball. [Pauline] I got it! Throw it back. Here. [Horse whinnies] Come on, honey. [Baby crying] Girls, you-all get on in here now. Get in the house. Come on. [Woof] Oh... Ooh! Here, kitty cat. Here, kitty cat. Here, kitty. Here, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty. Here...kitty. Kitty, kitty, kitty. Here, kitty, kitty, kitty. [Cat meows] Here, kitty, kitty. Here, kitty. Ooh, kitty. Here, kitty, kitty. Here, kitty, kitty, kitty. Oh, kitty, kitty. Oh! Ooh. Mister! You all right? Come on, now. Come on with me. I have to find my cat. What? I have to find my cat. Your cat? Forget about your cat. Here, kitty, kitty, kitty. Come on now. We got to get out of here. Oh, my lord! [Coughing] Come on in. Come sit down. Pauline, go fetch me a clean cloth. Is he going to be all right? Go on, honey. Beatrice, go fetch my sewing kit. Yes, ma'am. Sewing kit. Sewing kit. Oh... There we go. [Cat meows] [Meow] [Meow] [Meow] Hold on. Hold on. Here I come. [Meow] [Cat meows] Honey, what are you doing? Looks like a real character we took on. Come on back to bed. Oh... Mmm. That-a girl. Smell it? [Sniffing] My little doodlebug, you're the one. Best little doodlebugger in Texas. Go get it, girl. Go find it. [Beatrice] Look at those pretty green eyes. [Pauline] Melissa, this is kitty. Good morning, ladies. I haven't had the pleasure. My name's Beatrice. Nice to see you. And who are you? She's pauline. Well, I'm Mr. Cox-- not Duke, not lord, just plain old Mr. Cox. One for you. One for you. This here's Matilda. She can't read yet. Give her something to look forward to, won't it? Says here you're an oilman. There ain't no oil around here. You in the oil business, too? No, but i-- why don't you leave it to a fella who's made a study of it? I want you ladies to come with me. I want to show you something. Come here. All right. All right. Go get me some oil. Now... Now get down on your knees. Get down. Here we go. Now put your ear down on the ground. See? There. See? [Cat meows] Shh, shh, shh, shh. See? You can hear it. Sounds like sea shells. I can hear it! [Mother] Beatrice. Pauline. I don't believe a word you say. Oh... Hey, you two. [Mother] It's time to get going. Huh? I did hear it. Oh, well, don't you ever forget that either. Pauline. Go on. Go on. Get cleaned up. Morning. We're fixing to go to church. You're welcome to join US. Oh... I wouldn't miss that for anything, ma'am. I got a lot to be grateful for today.

It's been getting worse every year. It ain't rain we need. It's new soil. You think the government will give US that? No way in hell. Ooh, you good kitty. There's a good kitty. This cat's about the best friend I got. Yeah--the good kitty cat. I never had a cat before. Didn't you? Well, we'll see about that. Your turn. Go ahead. Did I win? As a matter of fact, you did. Excuse me, honey. Something I need to discuss with your daddy right now. O.k. You hold Matilda for me. O.k., I'll be right back. I always had an admiration for a man who worked the land. Now, that's a coincidence. I always had a secret admiration for salesmen. Well, I'm not a salesman. I'm in the oil business. Well, no offense, but you don't look like much of an oilman. Well, yeah. I've had my ups and downs. Yeah. Uh-huh. I'm familiar with your business. As a matter of fact, about 10, maybe 12 years ago, I worked on a well in south Texas. Is that right? Now, there's a lot of oil down there, if that's what you're looking for. There's a lot of it right here. You think so, do you? I know so. I knew the first day that I got here. That's probably quite a shock, you being a farmer and all. That's all Mac Holland was before he met with me. Who? You never heard of Mac Holland? He's one of the richest men in Texas. He's got two yachts and a house back there in Florida or Europe or somewhere, and he was a farmer just like you. What are you looking for, Mr. Cox? You want a lease? I couldn't do that to you. Do what? Stealing money out of your pocket like that. I would be, if we did it by lease. 12% for you, tops. Now, I ain't no lease hound. We're talking 50-50 right down the middle. [Hammering] We're talking partners here, partner. Partners? Excuse me? What do you mean when you say partners, Mr. Cox? Well, partners, dear lady, is--is--is 50-50. I got a pretty good feeling what my 50 is. What's your 50? Well, expertise, Mr. Don day. 30 years of drilling under the most adverse conditions you can imagine. Cable, rotary-- I know it all. I do. I really do. I'm willing to put that expertise on the line, and I'm doing you a favor. I'm talking about 5-- less than 5,000 here. We'll make millions. $5,000? Yes, ma'am. I know that's a lot of money to you, but you have neighbors, and they look up to you and Don. Now, hear me. It's coming to me. We could go to them as partners, together. Cut US a pretty respectable deal. I want to tell you something, Mr. Cox. The truth is, you look more like a hobo than any oilman. That's all right. No harm in that. Maybe we ain't much better off ourselves, but you think I'd get my neighbors involved in this? I think you better go, Mr. Cox. This would be good for everybody, Mr. Day. Not just me-- your neighbors, the little girls, your children-- the whole community. It really would. [Door banging] Well...I'll just get my things, if you don't mind, and I'll be on my way. $5,000. Wish I had $5,000. Crazy man. [Ding] Yes, sir? Can I help you? I'm looking for Norman sward's room number, please. No, no sward here. No sward. Well, how about Cedric hartman? No. No, sir. And, uh, let's see... P.g. Pratt? Yes, sir. Mr. Pratt. But I believe he said he was going-- well, there he is right there, sir. P.g.! Good to see you, sir. How you been? Mr. Cox? I'll be damned! Alex, come here. I want you to meet somebody. Hey. Alex is from Yale, but he's o.K. Ha ha ha! Why, hell, I haven't seen you since old Mac Holland got after you with a gun right after that Derrick collapsed. That wasn't my fault. That was that Mexican boy. Whoa, now. I remember you was telling me that. You staying here at the hotel, Mr. Cox? Actually, p.G., I'm working on a deal to get set up out there in, you know, Wichita county. Now, it's about 2,100 foot down, maybe 22. We can get to it for 12,000 if we go rotary. We could go cable, but rotary's better. I assume you've tested? I have evidence to believe there's oil, if that's what you mean. This thing's sitting on top of a salt formation just like spindletop. Spindletop. Yeah. You've heard of spindletop, I hope. There were salt formations at Rochester and sweet pie. I never heard of them. I'm not surprised. There wasn't any oil there. Oh, I see. Now, we're all on the same side. Look, p.G., I got nothing against your Yale boy here, but I'm handing you the chance of a lifetime. I know it's there. Nobody knows where there's oil. Is that right, college boy? Well...i know. Yeah. I know. Really? Yeah. How is it you know so much? You got a geologist's report? Soil samples? Anything at all? Well...i been there, I seen it, I heard it, I smelled it, and so did Matilda, and that's a damn fact. Ma-- yeah. This is the real thing. I mean, it nearly knocked me on the ground, my friend. We better go. Jessie's waiting. Mr. Cox, it's been nice chatting with you. It's always a pleasure to see somebody from the old days. Now... [Mr. Cox] Mrs. Pickens, I'll give you the opportunity to get in while there's still room. Uh-huh. Yeah. I can understand. Well...I'm sorry to hear that, but if that's the way you feel. Yeah. Well, you got--all right. Good-bye and god bless. Maybe another time. So much for the widows. [Meow] Now, let's see... I call it mother ground. Some people call it mother earth. In that ground-- what's in the ground? What do we have in the ground? Oil. Oil! Sure. Right. Now, how do we get this? Here's a good kitty. Here's the good kitty. It's o.K. Here we go. Good girl. Right there. Hello. Hi there. Uh...let's see. Greek food. That sounds interesting. Ha ha! Well, uh, this lamb sounds good. Uh...maybe have some of that later. I'll start with coffee. Coffee. Yeah. Maybe something later. I'll just start with coffee... And cream, a lot of cream. I like cream. [Purring] Thank you. You're welcome. Easy. Yeah. Here you go. Oop. Here you go. Yeah. Kitty, kitty. Yeah. [Glass breaking] [Man] Steal from me? I'll show you! I want that colored son of a bitch to pay for this! Next time, I'm hiring a white man! No two ways about that. [Man] Bring that son of a bitch here! Come on. Trying to strike again. It's mine, you understand? Steal my apron? Hey, you. Who, me? You a boozer? You hit the bottle? That's none of your business. I'm talking, see? You're broke, ain't you? O.k. My name's ligstow, buddy. I own this place. Best Greek restaurant in Texas. Ask anybody. I just caught one of my boys lifting food, so I'm down a dishwasher. A dishwasher? Well, I'm an oilman, you see. J. Paul getty's one of my busboys. Oh. I'm offering 12 bits a day, free bed, and 25 cents off meals. You don't like that, that's fine. Plenty of other men. I'll just get one of them. [Caruso singing opera music] Beatrice? Where's your sister? I don't know. Aren't you supposed to be keeping an eye on her? Yes, sir. It's getting late, Raymond. Yes, sir. Good night, bea. Good night, Raymond. Pauline, what are you doing? Nothing. Just listening to something. What? Oil. Well-- ha ha ha! I don't think you can hear oil, even if there was some. Mr. Cox says you can. Well, listen now. Don't listen to everything people tell you, o.K.? Especially people like Mr. Cox. You canhear it! O.k., o.K. Maybe you can. Come on. What? Oh, sugar. Listen. It, uh...Sounds like a sea shell. That's what Mr. Cox said. He did? [Mother] Come on, you two. Bedtime. What's oil, papa? Huh? Oil. What's it doing in the ground? Well, to tell you the truth, I don't know. Come on, honey. Oh, my. You are getting heavy. [Water sloshing] Mr. Cox... What is, uh, your Christian name? Mister. You're a cool one, huh, Mr. Cox? Huh? Old Zeke, he used to-- he was a talker. He'd run on about anything. Uh-huh. He said more in a minute than you'd a-said this week. We got three tables on station four. Yeah. Yeah. [Meow] Hey, baby. How you doing? You being a good girl? Yes, you are. You're a good girl. There's a good girl. Yes. Yeah. You're a pretty little thing, ain't you? Huh? Yes, you is. You like cats, don't you? I ain't never had me no cat. Most colored people think they're bad luck. Ain't that silly? Look at you. You seem to be making out just fine. Yeah. Sure. Meow. [Meow] Meooow. [Imitating harmonica] ♪ I used to have me a real big dog ♪ ♪ but he wouldn't stay that way ♪ ♪ he turned into a chicken ♪ ♪ when my cat chased him away ♪♪ I bet you're partial to music, ain't you, Mr. Cox? I like a dance tune now and then. Yeah. I'm a-saving up to get me a phonograph right now. Going to be a while... [Music box playing] But I'm determined. I like that. It's nice. [Woman] There must be some mistake. [Man] Well, I was talking to Abe melter. He's from jacksboro, you know, and, uh, he tells me he's down in Wichita falls the other day, and he sees Don coming out of stratmeyer's oil equipment. [Whispers] Come on. And he says, "hey, Don, how you doing?" Don just walks past him like he didn't even know him. Later, Abe's talking to stratmeyer himself, and stratmeyer lets on how Don was inquiring about how much it would cost to drill a well-- an oil well. So I'm sitting in my office thinking this over, and I start to wondering-- is Don planning on drilling for oil on your land? That's the silliest thing I ever heard. Well, yeah, that's what I said, only, um... Only what? I called up Mr. Stratmeyer myself, and he told me Don is suffering under the delusion that there is oil on this farm. Now, it's not my business to butt in where I'm not wanted, but the truth is, I'm afraid the loan our bank made in good faith is in jeopardy, and that makes it my business. People I've known all my life are losing their land and moving on. You've been a valued customer. I don't want to see that happen to you. Well, I appreciate that, les. Lee was a good friend of mine. Since he died, I felt it's my duty to look out for your best interests. I hope I'm not overstepping my bounds here. You'll have your money first thing in the morning. I'm glad we could nip this before it got out of hand. Thank you, les. You're welcome, Mrs. Timminger. It's the least I could do for Lee, god rest his soul. Her name ain't timminger, les. Ain't been for nearly 10 years. Take your dirty hands off my automobile. I'll take my dirty hands and stick them down your throat! Sick and tired of you causing trouble for people! Go on home, les. Well, I know you, Don day! Yes, sir, I know you. I know how you come riding in here on a freight train! I ought to call the police. I ought to! You's one of them nuts! Honey... Sit down here. I need to talk to you. What if that old man was right? What if there is oil here? I don't want to listen to that talk, Don. That money is for our farm. Our farm? Well, you say "our farm." Your ex-husband said it was his farm. I'll tell you whose it is-- the bank of henrietta's. Oh! Wake up! We're losing this place! Another six months, a year like this, and we're finished. We're not going to have a farm. You ain't never lived through seeing your family get kicked off their land. I have, and I do not aim to sit and watch it happen again. And I'm not going to watch you gamble our farm away. Who's going to feed our children? That old man? Is he going to clothe them? You tell me who will feed them when our land is gone. The bank of henrietta? I want that money back where it belongs. Maybe I got something to say about that! I don't want to hear it! [Children gasp] You girls get upstairs... Right now. Yes, ma'am. I want that money turned over to the bank. I've been thinking about that money for the last week, and I didn't know what to do, but I do now. Then I want you out of here. You what? I want you out of this house. You understand me? O.k. Fine. Fine. [Door closes] [Man] Hey, there's big Dave. Good morning. What you selling today? My arrangement's the same with all my employees. Just 'cause a man's face is white don't mean he gets special treatment. I ain't unfair in that way. I understand. It's just I've been working here almost two weeks, and if I didn't need a new suit as bad as I do, I wouldn't be asking. There's a principle working here that's bigger than just a few dollars. No, sir, there ain't nothing special about you. Maybe you got different ideas, but... You're going to have to wait till the proper payday like everybody else. O.k. I've been to every so-called oilman in town. Might as well be some... Dago off the boat as far as they care. Hey! Zeke-- Zeke got a suit. He bought it the day before they took him to jail. It'll fit you. Saved up his money for 10 weeks to buy it, and he didn't get to wear it. There it is. And it's brand-new, too. What you been hiding here? Looky here. That Zeke... He sure know how to dress. [Music and laughter] What can we do you for, sport? I'm just waiting on a friend. Come on. You go sit down over here with these other fellows. Where? Right over here. That's right. Y'all have fun, now. Hi, honey! Follow me. Lead on, my lady. All right, ladies. Let's go downstairs for payday! Yeah! Round 'em up! Round 'em up! Cross that river. A big-spending guy like me might have something special here. Ooh!ohh! Come here. Right this way. Let's see who's going to get this little diamond. Who's going to be the lucky girl? Me!me! Who wants it? Yes! Do I know you? No, but i'm going to know you. [Woman] Whoo! Where'd you get the duds? Vaudeville? Ha ha ha! Keep that one. She's a real card. Ha ha ha! No, uh...Old Mac, Mac Holland, told me to look you up. Fine. Well, tell Mac that big Dave says hello. Say, Dave, I just had a good one. How about you and me going someplace and tossing down a few? No, I don't think so. Mac made me swear I'd treat you to the town. Well, I'm not much of a drinking man, but, uh...I have worked up a bit of an appetite. Sure, Dave. You name the place. I took you for a steak man, Dave. What do you think, ed? Oh, he doesn't think. Must be a democrat! You're not a democrat, are you, Dave? I can't say much for the looks of this place. You been here? No, but I heard some gal almost died from something in her food here. Mr. Cox! Pleasure to see you. Don't say nothing. Shut up. Hey, p.G. How are you, sir? Good to see you, sir. No...i don't know. I think that gal did die. Matter of fact, I'm sure of it. Well, good evening, Mr. Cox. Who the hell is that? The boys in Detroit don't got this problem. The country thinks Henry Ford is a Saint. Why? Boosting. They can call it public relations or modern advertising, but it's plain, old-fashioned boosting. That's it in a nutshell. That really is. You can believe me on that one. [Mr. Cox] Here's to luck, queen of destiny, and hail to oil. Oh, my god. I'll lay my cards on the table. I'd hoped to stay away from business, but I've been impressed by the way we've hit it off. You know who's out there? Big Dave mcdermit. I'll bet he's the richest man in Texas. Oh, do tell. I think you just might be interested here. I think. Ha ha ha! Did I say something wrong, Dave? What did I say? You're a hopeless loser, Mr. Cox. I just don't have time for losers. You say hello to Mac for me now, you hear? Mr. Mcdermit, let me introduce myself. I own this restaurant. Well, good for you! Ha ha ha! I gave you a job washing dishes, but that ain't good enough for you. $13.50. Got the money for that...Oilman? Take it out of the money you owe me. You ain't getting a nickel out of me after this stunt. I got a few dollars. All I want you to do is go and phone the police. Oh, I'll talk to you later. Shirl, you call them! So...this is the way it is, huh? [Glass shatters] Oilman, huh? You ain't nothing but a cheap promoter! Can't even wash dishes decent. I'm calling the police! Crazy. Hey, this is Larry ligstow. Get me the police. How much love or money are you asking? Well, I can't sell her to you. No, no, sir. She's got too much sentimental value for that... But I might lease her to you. Lease? Well... Say, $300 now and $100 by the week. Well...ha ha ha! You've lost your mind. That wouldn't leave me enough for pipe or timber. You couldn't get one of them Wichita falls spudders for less than twice that. Now, don't take me for ignorant. I don't like that. Yeah. I tell you what, boy. I'll throw in some timber and three men to help you put up a Derrick. I'll tell you what. I just might be willing to let you in for a percentage. I told you before. Don't take me for ignorant. Ha ha ha! [Laughing] [Man] Hold it. Step back! O.k., red! Got it, red! There it goes! All right. Just go on back there. [Unlocking door] Get in there. [Door closes] Much obliged. Really appreciate all your help. Thank you. [Car starts] [Don] Thanks! You looking for a job, Raymond? Yes, sir. There might be some work here after school and on weekends. Now, listen, I don't want you doing anything dangerous, you hear? Yes, sir. O.k. Deal. Get in there. Yeah. You look good. You look good, Mr. Cox. Well, here's your cat. Good. Come here, baby. Sure missed you. Look, I don't reckon I'll be seeing you for a while. Got a letter from home. Mamma's sick, so, uh... Oh, sorry to hear that. Good luck. Yeah. Thank you, Robert. You're a good man. You are. Oh, thank you, sir. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Yeah. Well... Who missed who the most? Bet you didn't even miss me, did you? I didn't miss you any. Yeah. This is it, darling. I got to take care of some business, all right? Now, if I don't come back, I want you to hook up with one of these roughnecks, all right? They'll take care of you. They're good men. But you got to behave yourself, all right? Give me a little kiss, o.K.? [Purring] Yeah, good girl. Yeah. [Meow] That's the way it's got to be. That's the way it's got to be. It sure beats the hell out of me. Everything seems to be running smooth. Well, it ain't going nowhere. Just stopped. Well, it got me whupped. How deep did you say we was? I don't know. Maybe 1,300 feet. 1,300? Yeah. So what? Well, what the hell you trying to do? I told you before this rig wasn't built to go more than 1,200 feet, you damn fool! The deal is off! I want my rig back! You never said nothing about no 1,200 feet! Oh, the heck I didn't! That's what comes when you deal with ignorance! And don't you touch that rig till I bring my boys over to bring it home! [Car door slams] [Engine starts] Thank you, sir. Good day, sir. Good day. How can I help you? I'd like a room, please. O.k. I've met all kinds, mister... Not Duke, not lord, just plain old Mr. Cox. Well, Mr. Cox, you'll be staying in room 216. [Ding ding] Ha ha ha! Take Mr. Cox to room 216. Thank you, sir. Enjoy your stay. For you. Thank you. Thank you, sir. Thank you very much. O.k. Dinnertime. O.k., darling. There you go. Wait a minute. [Knock on door] Cora? Cora. What I did was stupid. It was... It was so stupid. Maybe I thought I'd do something even your Lee couldn't do. I don't know. We got till the 1st to pay this note... And I don't know what to do about it. I'm going to talk to the bank. Maybe they'll give US an extension. Stop saying US. You're still my wife. [Door closes] [Furrows] Don, it would be against state banking laws. We're not talking about a lot of time here, just a couple of months. Well, I don't see how you'd be better off then. I'm not just asking for me. [Telephone ringing] Well, I can't live Cora's life for her. I'm just glad Lee isn't alive to see what's happened to his farm. Why, it would break that poor man's heart to have Cora lose that land. Lee was a friend of mine, Don. He wasn't no daydreamer like you. No. Lee was all man. What are you thinking? It ain't even worth talking about. Mommy! [Pauline] Mommy! Help! Mommy! Help me! Oh, my god. Mommy! [Dog barking] Pauline! Pauline! [Beatrice] Oh, my god, no! Pauline! [Pauline] I'm scared! Mommy! Pauline, I'm coming up there! Don't move! Mommy! Raymond, be careful! [Beatrice] Hurry! Get her down! Be careful! Mommy! Keep still, pauline! Mommy! Help! Please, god. Please, god. Pauline! Aah! No! No! Raymond! Daddy! No. I'll be back soon, son. [Thunder] So, tell me, doc. When are we going to know something? We'll know more about it in a couple of weeks. A couple of weeks? Well, I want to thank you, doctor. You did everything you could. Mr. Rumsfelk? I don't know what to say. Uh...I'll do everything I can to pay these hospital expenses. I don't know how, but I promise you, no matter how long it takes-- you're Don day. Yes, sir. You're the one that did this. It's not enough I've come to this hellhole to teach your stupid children. No, that's not enough for a man like you. Cora. Oh... My husband loves your son. I think you ought to know that. [Door closes] I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. Children, come on. Beatrice. I can't move. Oh, honey. [Cox] Dear Mr. Day, good news. It appears that I have been successful in interesting a number of moneyed investors in the oil venture we discussed at your farm. As yet, I've been only able to raise a portion of the necessary capital, though I expect to have acquired the remainder within a few days or weeks at most. Yours in good health, Mr. Cox. All right, let's see what you bought with all that money, huh? Couple pairs, aces and tens. [Big Dave] Ha ha! [Man] Every time. Yeah, well, this ain't the boy scouts, doc. What can I tell you? Let's play a man's game. Five stud. Ante. Hey! Hey! Don't anybody move. You won't live to spend that. Hold it! [Glass shatters] [Woman screams] Aah! [Man] Stay down. Operator! Ow! Jeez! Drop it! Here. [Grunting] Aargh! Aah! Ohh! Aah! Come on! [Groaning] They're on the second floor! We'll take care of it. [Groan] Hello? Check the street! I'll cover the lobby! [Big Dave] I want him found. You hear me? Find him! I want every room in this hotel checked! I want this whole damn town turned right upside down! This is no time to dillydally! Aah! Let's go. [Meow] This is no time to dillydally. Come on. Yeah. Hello! Mr. Day! Mr. Don day! Good morning. Hello! Mr. Day! Mr. Don day! It's me! I'm back! What the hell do you want? I want to talk to you! Why don't you just go on about your business? No. I've been traveling all night. I just want to talk, that's all. Well, if it's the oil you're interested in, you can just wait till the 1st. Talk to the bank about it. It ain't got nothing to do with me no more. Mr. Day, listen to me. When I was out here before, I said I wanted you as a partner. That wasn't no stunt I was pulling. I meant it. Now... Oh, did you ever read my letter? Did you get my letter? I read your letter, Mr. Cox. Oh, ma'am. Yeah. Then you know I'm telling you the truth. [Cox] I wouldn't lie to you. Now, listen to me. Listen. I make my living from the ground. Now, this is a gold mine we're standing on here, lady. I know it, and I think your husband knows it. Now, I can get to it, Mrs. Day. I got the money. I got the expertise. Somebody is going to get to it someday, and I want it to be US. Now, think about it. You have your children, your house, your land. Don't let this all go to waste. Do you hear me? Does somebody hear me? It's not my decision, Mr. Cox. It's up to my husband. Oh, mamma! [Cora] Beatrice? Honey? Make him leave. Don't let him stay here. Who--Mr. Cox? It's his fault Raymond's in the hospital. If he hadn't come here in the first place, none of this would have ever happened. The reason Raymond's in the hospital is because he fell off the Derrick. He was trying to help pauline. That's right. He fell off the Derrick trying to help somebody in trouble. It's just the way he is. He'll probably always be that way. You can't blame Mr. Cox for that. Let me ask you something. [Groan] Why did you decide to drill where you did? Huh? A hunch? A feeling? Yeah, yeah, a feeling. All right, now, where did you have this feeling? Where? Yeah. You got to be exact about this. Was it here? Did you feel it-- what? Here or here? In there? Here? Right there. That's right. Right there. That's it. That's exactly right. How did you know? That's exactly what I thought. Ha ha! Yeah. So what the hell's wrong? I said I felt it. Nothing's wrong. Nothing's wrong. It's o.K. What are you doing? Oh... Little trade secret. Something I devised called "oil to oil." Oil to oil. All right, now, let's get to it. Out of the way, kitty. Ha ha ha! You're not an oilman, are you, Don? I never said I was. That's right. That's right. You never did, did you? How about letting an oilman teach you something? When you feel it here, that is zinc. When you feel it here, that, my friend, is oil. O.k., now, let's bear down here, all right. Just watch these sticks. It might take a while. It might take a while. Yes, sir. Wait a minute. I think I do feel something. Where? Where do you think you feel something? Huh? It's not there? No. Right in there. Damn. Me, too. Probably got a little coal on your land, Don. That's what that means. Ha ha! Ha ha ha! Ha ha! God, what an idiot. Ha ha ha! Pardon me. Ha ha! M-Mr. Cox. Huh? Mr. Cox! Come here. Come here! Spread them right there. Right there, no doubts about it. Don't move. Don't you move an inch. I'll show you something here. Ha ha ha! You found it first. You Mark it. [Meow] Ah... [Meow] You're a little late, darling. You come in third. Ha ha ha! Oh... It's a hell of a business, ain't it? It's a hell of a business. [Man] I'll be with you in a minute. Let me do the dickering. I've dealt with this bird before. Lucas, come over here. Mr. Cox? Huh? By golly, Mr. Cox. Roy, you son of a gun! I thought that was you. You looking for work? Yes, sir. I could use some. Well, you got it. This is my partner Don day. Don, this is Roy. Nice to meet you. Pleasure. Well, let's get to it. Let's get started. [Car doors close] Come on, boys. Here we go. Oh! Get it up! [Roy] There you go, now. Make sure it's even down there. We got her now! [Don] Coming up! [Roy] It's higher than it looks. Hey, here's to luck! Yee-ha! Yes, sir. Huh. No wonder... You got a flood in here. What did the authorities have to say? They don't know about it. They won't, unless I choose to tell them. That gun was found in a room rented to a cheap promoter named Cox. Mr. Cox, he calls himself. I want him found. And? Just found. How's it look? Clay. Huh? Clay. Well, I don't know. We're nearly 1,800 feet. See anything? Nope. Engine's kind of running raggedy. Losing power. Might be a good idea to get an overhaul. Nope. Too much time. We have to have it in by the 1st. Ha! I think I'll have myself a little walk. Yeah. Sure seems to know a lot about oil, don't he? Uh-huh. Well, you worked with him a lot of times, haven't you? Oh, yeah. Several times. There's Phoenix number 21 I worked on. Then we done Phoenix number 27. And there's some other Phoenix I can't remember the number of right now. Well, what's his affection for Phoenix? Does he name them all that? Up to now he has, but that's just till he hits his first strike. His firststrike? Well, who did you think you was dealing with-- rockefeller? You mean to... You mean to tell me that he's never... Nope. Not so far, he ain't. Ha ha ha! Well, I sure can pick them, can't I? Hell, I pull them out of the woodwork. [Gasp] I wasn't doing nothing bad. I know, I know. It's kind of a long walk to henrietta, isn't it? Ha ha! How'd you know I went to henrietta? I heard the hospital let your boyfriend go home. How's he doing? The doctor said one of his legs might be a little gimpy. I'm sorry to hear that. God, you're a stubborn woman. Not here. I want you back where you belong. [Man] Hello, Dave. Yeah, I found him. He's on a farm about 3 miles west of henrietta-- the day farm. You done good. Want me to notify the authorities? I said I'll take care of it. Go on back to Houston. Leave the rest to me. Whoa. What do we have here? Why don't you just give that to the old man? Bea and I will dish out the rest of these. Hold that, Roy. Mr. Cox. Yeah? Oh, thank you. If it's too cold tonight, you're more than welcome in the house. Thank you, ma'am, but we're too close to the pay now. We're almost there. You really think so? Oh, I do. I really do. I do. Much obliged. Thank you. Roy! Roy, get that lantern over here! Point it in here and tell me what you see, what you smell, and what you taste. I'm going to let you get some. Your first taste, son. First-- first time, son. It's better than ice cream, isn't it? Mmm. [Roy] That's oil. By god, you luckless bastards, you did it. Ha ha ha! Woo! Now, what I need is storage tanks. Go tell stratmeyer we need those tanks now. We need them tonight. On the double. Go on. Go on. Hang on. Take my truck. Hold on. Come here. Give this to him. Go to his house. You know where he lives? On the double. Don't get lost, Roy. I won't. Ha ha ha! Mr. Stratmeyer! 97, 98, 99, 100... No! I think the line's out of the shive. Shut her down! Shut the thing down! [Shouts] Come on. Move! [Thunder] Come on, boys, let's go! Get those out of here! Get them out of here. Go! Go! [Whistle] How are you doing up there? It's going to be a while! I think this thing will blow over in a minute. Yeah? That would be all right. [Horn honking] The well's coming in! [Whistles] [Horns honking] My lord, it's so late. My mamma's going to kill me. What's going on? [Shouts and whistles] Oil strike at the day farm! Beatrice, look! Your daddy did it! [Horns honking] Wait! Please stop! Stop! Raymond? Please, can we go with you? What are you doing out here? Come back here right now. Do you hear me, son? What is she doing here? Raymond! Raymond! Oh! [Shouting and horns honking] [Urinating] What the hell? Button it up. Let's go. Get in the car. Get in the damn car. Help! Ha ha ha! All right, y'all get over there and help them on that thing. You boys, get them barrels down. Get them storage tanks over there. We're bringing it in for you, Mr. Cox! You done good, Roy. You brought half the town with you. All right, then. See what he did? Ha ha ha! Roy done good! There he is. Put that thing down, you damn fool. Change of plans. We hit gas! We hit gas! We hit gas! Everybody, jump quick! Everybody get out of here! [Screams] Don? Cora, get away from here now! Come on. Come with me. Stay back. We'll take care of Don. You all right? Roy, get the nitro! Don, get two lengths of pipe. We'll blow it out. Blow it out? That's the only way we can get it out. You better get rid of this. Come on back! Bring it on back! Easy! Move it! Bring it back easy! Come on, bring it back! Look out, now. Back up. Bring her back! All right, now. Bring it back. Bring it on back down! Bring it back! That's it! Easy! Bring it back now! Come on now! [Rumbling] Woo! Coming out of chute number four. Don! Cora! [Pipes hitting ground] My sister. Oh, Don. I'm all right. I'm all right. I'm all right. Mr. Cox? Oh, lord. Mr. Cox? He's breathing. [Rumbling] Hey. Hold it, boss. Hey. [Cheering] Oh, it's great. Hey, that's mine. That's mine! That oil belongs to me. That old bastard used my money. Don't you die on me now, you son of a bitch! You know damn well that belongs to me! You used my money! I want my damn money! Hey! Get off my land! All right, we're going, we're going, we're going, damn it. You take good care of him, you understand? You take good care of that old man! Now, you know damn well that's my money! That oil belongs to me! All right, all right. Goddamn. How about that? [Big Dave] I'll be back! Do you hear me? I'll be back! How's it look, Don? Ha ha! It looks pretty damn good now that you're talking, Mr. Cox. Ha ha! Like nothing else. Don. Don day... What time you got there, buddy? What time is it? Well, Mr. Cox... It's 6:30. June 19th, 6:30 A.M. People will remember that for a long time to come. That's something nobody can take away from US, Don. No matter what happens... They can't take this night away from US. No, sir. No, sir... They never can. Oh. Thank you, sweetheart. Thank you. Yeah. O.k. Here we go. Mr. Cox made it, all right. He did move a little slower than he did before, and the doctor said his hearing would never be the same again. Don. Yes, sir. 2,400 barrels a day now. 2,400? That's good. What's that you say, Don? [Louder] I said that's not bad! No, it's not bad at all. Yeah. Ha ha! Pauline, will you give this man some peace? No, no, she's fine. She's fine. Mr. Cox, you're going to spoil her rotten. He paid back all his "investors" with interest, even that horrible Dave mcdermit. Mr. Cox was an oilman, not a thief. Oilman or not, it wasn't long before Mr. Cox got what he called "bugs between his toes," or "itchy feet" as some less colorful might say. Here. Let me take that for you. Thank you, Raymond. Thank you. Thanks for the little get-together, Cora. You're welcome, Mr. Cox. Bless you. All right, this is it. Raymond, bring that over here. See what you're made of. Ha ha! Throw it in there. Yes, sir. And, uh... Be careful, Don. You, too, Mr. Cox. What was that? I said you, too, Mr. Cox! Oh, I will be, Don. I will be. You can bet on that. Yes, sir. Come here. Get in, darling. Kitty, kitty. Come on. Get in. Now... I got a special little gift for a special little friend of mine. Thank you. You're welcome. Now I'm going to tell you something. Nobody else can hear this. I promise. You promise? Well... Well, folks, there will be no tears shed here today... Including myself. Ha ha ha! You're fine people... And I want to thank you. I really mean that. So good-bye for now. [Pauline] Good-bye. Get over there, darlin'. Get over there. She doesn't want to go. Ha ha! Finest people I ever knew in my life. Till we meet again. Bye. Bye-bye. That was the last time we saw Mr. Cox. He sold out his interest in the field, and that was that. He made a lot of money, no question about that. Hail to oil! But he could have made a lot more if he'd stayed around a while. The rumor was he took it all to California and got into real estate, lost every dime he had. Ha ha! I don't know about that. I don't think it was the money he really cared about, anyway. It was the life he loved and the game that goes with it. I'll never forget what he whispered to me in my ear that day-- "hitch your wagon to a star, sweetheart." I've lived my life by that. Captioning made possible by Warner Bros.
