(dramatic music) (upbeat hip hop music) - Oh (sighs). - En garde, you thief! - Grow up. - I said, en garde. - You big kid, let me just borrow your shorts, just for one day? - No. - Well, if I shall win this fight, I will keep the shorts, right? - But what if you lose, huh? - I will clean your room. - Okay. Ha, en garde. - En garde. - You will clean this room, you slime bucket. - I shall not. (Donna groans) - You cheated. - (laughs) You don't mess with me. - Greedy. - I am a Bon Viant (grunts). - Donna, you're going to be late for school again, girl. - Thank you for the shorts. - Ah. - Good morning, Mom. - [Josephine] Good morning, honey. Did you finish your term paper? - Mm-hmm, where's Dad? - [Josephine] He had to go in early today. - Hey, Mom. - [Josephine] Don't bounce that ball in my kitchen, boy. - Okay, shorty. - I see you been winning, though. - Hey, Ma, look what I painted. - It's beautiful. It's beautiful. - You like that? - Hang it in my room. - Yeah, you wish, this oughta be in a gallery, not a zoo. - Ha, cheap shot, Pete. - I'm late, I'm outta here. - Move, Thadius. - [Thadius] And I want my shorts back, too. - Forget you. - Good morning, Mom. - Good morning, Thadius. - Hey, Pete, nice picture, man. - Thanks. - Hey, you guys want to show Mom that dance? - Yeah. - Yeah, alright. - Alright, okay, here we go. On three, alright? - Okay. - Alright, one, two, three. ♪ We are the great Bon Viant brothers (grunt) - Ooh, I like that (laughs). - Whoa, you're running late again, aren't you? - Yeah, Dad, what are you doing back here? - I forgot some papers. - Okay, I'll see you later. - Okay. - [Andre] Hey, hold on, hold on, hold on. - What, where were you last night? - Told ya I had something to do, I'm sorry, alright? - I don't want to hear that. - Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. - Right on then. - What's wrong, baby? - Settle down, settle down, settle down. Settle down, settle down. Settle down, settle down. Settle down. Settle down. - Psst. - I assume you all have your term papers ready? - Yes. - Oh, yes, sir, yes. - Uh, you can pull mine out that picnic blanket you got on. (students laughing) - Andrew? - It's Andre, man. (girl retching) - Andre, comment wasn't necessary. - There ain't nothing wrong with her. - [Woman] Morning sickness. - You may be excused. (students laughing) (chattering and jeering) - [Fluffy] She's known for faking and shaking, man. - Wasn't it the one that goes. - Oh, yeah! - What's up, man? (students chattering and laughing loudly) - Settle down, settle down. Can anyone tell me anything they've learned about the 17th century? Yes? - Professor Langford, you know, the blacks in France-- ♪ Kick it, buh-buh-buh black, black people - [Victor] Andre, please. - Just tryin' to help him out, man, that's all. - [Victor] He does not need your help. Please continue, Isaac. - I said, blacks in France, (students snickering) must have had a lot of fun in those days. - Isaac, we know you would've had fun in those days. You would've had a castle full of women. - Isaac, you would have worn that old castle out, running from room to room. - [Students] Ooh! - But Isaac doesn't really need a castle. He could just pretend, right, Cynthia? - I guess. - You guess, talking about, I guess. See, that's what's wrong with you all nappy-head, sausage-lip, funky-drawers girl. - Whoo. - Fillin' those bubble-head boys' minds with all them more happy thoughts. - Shut up! - No, you shut up, sound like a machine gun and spitting on me, man. (students laughing) - Oh, no, let me tell you something. I had a grandfather and he had no problem with stuttering. I had a cousin named Jose who had three kids, three, and no problem ever, but they had a dog named Pepi, all the time, all the time (imitates dog baying), stutter all the time, all of them. And then we had another dog-- - And you talk too much. - Right. - She told you. - Got you. - Shut up, man. - Anyway, how you gonna get any women when you can't even tuh-tuh-tuh-tuh-talk? (students laughing) See now, me, y'all know if I'd been living in those days, I'd have had all the fine ladies, 'cause y'all know, I'm a smooth operator. - Yeah. - You aint' nothing but a smooth criminal, and give back that chain you stole. My brother's gonna kick your butt. - Naw, your brother's gonna mess around and kick the bucket, messing with me. - Please, punk, gimme back the chain. - Think you better go sit down, alright? Come on, girl. - You stole that. You make me sick. - Told ya, I got this from my grandmother when she was on her deathbed. - You lying dog, you stole it. - I got it, it's mine, I got it. - You stole it. - Criminals like you get put away for a long time, brother. - I know that's right. - You better watch your mouth, sucker. You don't talk about my friends like that. (students laughing jeering) - Girlfriend. - Ooh! - Stop it, stop it, Donna, come to my desk, please. - That's what you get. - She's always going to the desk. - Always up there. - Yeah. - Here we go. - Why were you late? - Well, I wasn't gonna come at all because I forgot about the due date, and I was hoping you'd give me some more time. - You mean to tell me you have the unmitigating gall, the audacity, the effrontery to tell me something you've had a month to prepare is not completed? - Yes, I've been so busy with dance lessons. Please, be understanding. - I assume you're going to do your thesis on the great work of Alexandre Dumas, The Three Musketeers. - I saw the movie. - Donna, don't be foolish, read the book to get the true essence of this black man's story. - He was black? - Of course he was black. - [Woman] Donna, I knew that. - You didn't know nothing, shut up. - Of course you know it now, I just told you. Donna, I'm going to excuse you from this class, but I want you to go the Renaissance library and get to work, and by tomorrow morning, I want a completed paper on my desk by 8:00 a.m. You hear that, Donna, 8:00 a.m., is that clear? - Yes, sir, and I promise you, I'll get an A. (Andre laughing) - Thief. I'll see y'all later. (hand slaps) (students jeering) - Hey, where you going? - Why is Miss Prissy so privileged? She gets to come late and leave early. - That's right. - All the time. - Come on, you guys, she really is a nice person. - [Class] Oh, shut up, Cynthia. - [Fluffy] Old nappy-head girl. - Just a minute, Miss Bon Viant. Now where do you think you're going? - I'm going to the library. - Oh, I just bet. Now, you are always getting privileges, leaving class early, and let me tell you something, I'm sick of it. Sick of it, sick, sick, sick! Now your parents were some of the best students at this institution. They also contribute to this school. Now what's wrong with you? - I'm trying, Dean Baltimore, I'm really trying. - Well, let's just see how hard you can try. I want you to meet me in my office this afternoon, understood? - Yes, Dean. (man laughs) Oh, shut up. - And what are you laughing at, young man? - Man, I'm just going to class. - [Baltimore] I will make sure you get there. - [Man] Hey, let go of my threads. - [Baltimore] What's wrong with you? - Look, can we talk about this thing just one more time, please? - You never do what you say you're gonna do. What have you done for me lately? - What have I done for you lately? - I don't want to discuss it anymore. - But wait a minute, baby, let's talk about this thing, just one more time. - [Donna] What's up, Big Al? - Hi, Donna, I'm the king! - You're the king, alright. - Don't talk to him, he's just an old drunk. - He's alright, Estelle, see you later. - [Estelle] Scumbucket dog. - Old hag, I am the king, so you better count your blessings. (upbeat hip hop music) - [Donna] Leave me alone. - [Charles] Girl. - Move, just go away. What are you doing here? - I followed you. - You are really pathetic. - Excuse me, miss, is this the Renaissance library? - [Donna] Yes, sir. - Thank you. - Look, I said it before and I'll say it again. I'm not gonna date you or any other boxer, or any kind of athlete. - Donna, don't forget about rehearsal tonight. - Oh, don't, don't categorize all athletes as being irresponsible and stupid. - That's what you are, go date Sharon LeBlue. - I don't want her, I want you. - I don't want to hear it, just move. Go date Sharon LeBlue or some other girl. She's always at your boxing matches. - I don't want her, I want you. - I don't care, just move. - [Charles] Aw, girl, give a guy a break. - You've got it, fag. - Oh, you just can't be nice, huh? Butch. (upbeat music) - Hey, hey, no, no, uh-uh, hey, this is my spot. This is my spot, there's a little scribble on it. That's my name, Russell, Russell, that's me. - Whew, your breath is stinking. - What, what, you smell my breath from way over there? - Yes, I do. - Well, ooh, alright, fine, fold your legs. - What are you drinking? - The muscatel, this the best wine east of the Mississippi. - They still making that stuff? - Yeah, I hope so, I'm drinking it. You want some? - [Donna] No, thank you, just leave. I'm trying to do a book report right now. - You doin' a report in my spot. Keep the spot, I don't want to be dukin' it out with no lady, so you stay here, and I'll just find somewhere else to lay down, okay? - Just don't start snoring. - You the one with the bean dip, baby, don't start farting. - [Donna] Please just go somewhere. - (hums) Get me a nap, baby. Oh, there we go, legs now, there go one. Let me tell ya, I... - I mean it, don't start snoring. (snoring) I knew you were gonna start that snoring. You're right, he said quietly, I've never been in love. Stony-hearted fellows like you have no right to be hard on poor, soft-hearted fools like us, said d'Artagnan. Soft hearts, broken hearts, muttered Athos. What's that you're saying? I'm saying that love's a lottery in which the prize is death. You're very lucky to have lost, d'Artagnan, believe me. And if you're wise, you'll take care always to lose. (peaceful music) - Drink up, my friends. (peaceful music) Oh, oopsy-daisy! Come on, my friends, one more time. One more time. (men muttering and chattering quietly) (bodies thudding) He'll rather drink here. Wait, don't talk, my friends, let's drink. Come, we drink. You two gentlemen are the only ones left who can drink with Russell. You like the muscatel, so I have a reward for you. Hats, I have a hat for each of you, ha! This man, come forward, my friend, take off your hat. Here, on sale, here's a hat for you. It is nice, okay? - Uh-huh-huh-huh! - (laughs) For muscatel! Come, my friend, for you, stand up, be brave. I will make you a Muscatel. I honorary christen you a Muscatel, take off your hat. (Victor laughs) There you go, monsieur. It's very good, you men are very brave. I can tell you are looking for adventure. - Oui, oui. - I'd like to help you. I have a friend in Spain, King Nacho. His daughter has been kidnapped and is lost. (laughs) I thought maybe you gentlemen could help. - Do you think we'll get a reward? - Yes, I do believe you will get money. - Ah, I think we should be off, John (laughs). - Then be on your way, be adventurous, my friends. I tell you, they don't make men like they used to. Superb, the fools will go and help return this kidnapped daughter. You see, if Russell's muscatel doesn't kill you, it will make you brave. Oh well, since it was my muscatel that got these two started, I am going to tell the story. The two brave men, Victor Langford and John Bon Viant, rode off furiously to rescue the princess, but first he encountered some mean Spanish bandits. - Stop, who goes there? - [John and Victor] The Muscatels. - [Bandits] The Muscatels? - Yes, and we're looking for the princess Josephine. - The princess Josephine, huh, she's not here. She's a long way from here, in our leader Juan Perez's hideout. - [John] Then we shall go a long ways to find her. - You must get past us first. Dismount and fight like men. - Shall we? - We shall. - [Both] En garde. (upbeat music) - I'm not a fool, I'm out of here. - Come back and fight, you coward. - Wait, come back, wait, hold on, hold on, wait, come back, wait, hold on. - [Russell] The Muscatels chased the cowardly bandit until the next day. - You stole my horse. - You want some cheese, princess, hmm? (laughs) - My general, all are lost, we were attacked. - Attacked? - Attacked. - Who dare attack my men? - (gasping) Two. - Two, two what? - 200, my general, or maybe more. - Hmm, must have been King Nacho's men, looking for his daughter. - Must have been, my general. - How did you escape? - We had a great fight, my general, killing many. I had this plan that if the enemy struck me with the slightest blow, I would fall, ooh, ooh, ah, and play dead and later escape and bring the news to you. But I was fighting so fiercely, the men could not touch me. Therefore, I had to trip myself and crawl under a body and play dead, my general. - Good acting, Carlos, good acting. You are a fierce fighter and should be rewarded. - Well, thank you, my general. I kill many more next time. - Were you followed? - Who, me, Carlos (laughs) the Fierce? - I know you, they are probably right behind you. Ah, get the princess, let's get out of here before they find us. - Shh, I think I hear them now. - Oh, what am I doing, cheese and bread, I'll eat there. (Josephine groans) - Stop, you toads. - The Muscatels (groans). - This the two, 200? - Get rid of that knife. - Now. (Juan laughs) - Oh, look, my men, ha ha! I'm out of here. - I'm out of here too. - Stop, you cowards. (Josephine yelling) - How dare you, you pig-headed, goat-headed, goat-toasters, you know who I am? I will have those empty shells you call heads for this. - Be careful, Senorita, one of us may be your husband. - Ha, that is just a dream. My father would not give me away to the likes of you. He would rather see me dead. That reward was if a nobleman rescued me, not some poor, obviously penniless peasants. Now take me to the king, you dogs. - (imitates howling) John, in dog language, that means she is your wife, for sure. - [Josephine] Take me. - You two bumbling idiots have ruined my plans again. Now get into the carriage so that we can beat them to the castle. Hurry, Juan, come along, Carlos. Why do I put up with you two in the first place? Off to the castle, immediately. - Father, I have been trying to resolve this since my return so that I may send these knaves on their way. - My daughter, do not think that I am not happy to have you back, but you are a pain where I must sit. My enemy wanted my kingdom for you, and you know how much I love my kingdom. - Wine, my king. - Yes, and pour slowly. - [Women] Grapes, Your Highness? - Yes, big round ones (laughs). (women giggle) - Sweet apples, my king? - Oh, two big, firm ones. - Melons, Your Highness? - Oh, did you see the size of those melons? - Yes, father (laughs). - Bananas, my king. - Use your imagination. - I think not. My king, would you really like a banana? - I would rather peel you. - We can do that much later, but right now, you must deal with your daughter, for she is so upset. - [Josephine] What are you saying, father? - Do you really think I'd give up all this for you? - [Josephine] Yes, I'm your daughter! - Josephine, shut up! Uh, stand up. Drink up. This is truly a magnificent occasion. I, King Alberto Nacho, and my son Prince Alberto Nacho II, do hereby declare this a day of celebration. My daughter has been rescued, my kingdom is saved, and my enemy for 10 years, that evil son of a snake, Juan Perez, has failed again to get my kingdom, thanks to our honored guests. - John Bon Viant. - Yes, and, uh. - Victor Langford. - Yes, and as always, thanks to my fine English friend, Count Baltimore, who saved my life in England. - Hear, hear. - [Crowd] Hear, hear. - Sit down. John, Victor, one of you will be very happy with my beautiful daughter. - Your Majesty, which one shall wed the princess? - Yes, Father, which one? - Two men are better than one, my dear. - No! - The king always keeps his word. Let's celebrate. - Bring out the Bean Dip Dancers. - Yes, the Bean Dip Dancers. (upbeat music) Everybody bean dip! ♪ Everybody bean dip ♪ Yeah boy (man laughing) ♪ Everybody ♪ Everybody ♪ Everybody ♪ Every, every, everybody bean dip ♪ Yeah boy ♪ Yeah boy - I told your mother not to marry that fool. God rest her soul, he'd marry you off to a duck if he could. - Oh, Grandmama, Father is not a bad man, he is just so slow. - Stupid, stupid. - What am I going to do, what's going to happen? (man laughing) ♪ Everybody, everybody bean dip ♪ Yeah boy ♪ Every, every, every, everybody bean dip - Estelle, with all due respect, would you kindly get your tired old butt out of here so that I can have a moment of privacy with my daughter? - Why, you stupid, ungrateful-- - Grandmama, please, don't argue with him, he's the king. - Yes, I am the king. - You are nothing but a lucky old African who won the Spanish lottery, and this prize of a little grape field you call a wine country has nothing going for it but the Bean Dip Dancers. - Stop with the insults. Now leave, or I'll have you thrown into the dungeon. - Say what! Don't you know I'll kick your butt all over this castle? - [Josephine] Grandmama, please. - You know, I must really, really love you. - Guards, take her away. - Albert, don't let me catch you on my side of the castle. You lopsided-head, big-nose, booger-eating scumbucket fool! - Bone-head! My daughter, I would give up 10 kingdoms for you. Juan Perez knew this, that is why he had you captured. I do truly love you, child. Since your mother's death, you have stood as a constant reminder of her strength, grace, and spirit. You know how much I loved her. - Yes, Father. - I have decided that you should marry John Bon Viant. And you must live as common people in a small village in France. There, Juan Perez will not be able to find you and your husband. May I call them now, Josephine? - I am ready, my father, my king. - John, Victor! - [Both] Yes, Your Majesty. - I have had your gold and jewels loaded onto your horses, but before you go, I would like to give each of you half of this unique medallion. It has been in my family for generations. Let it serve as a constant reminder of my gratitude and appreciation. Josephine, my crown. (John and Victor laughing loudly) (Alberto clears throat) - Pardon, Your Majesty. - Your Majesty. - Keep it safe, for it is truly a valuable gift. - [Both] Thank you, Your Majesty. - [John] I shall keep this close to my bosom. - [Victor] And I shall keep mine close to my heart. - [Russell] Five years later, somewhere in a little house in the south of France. - [Victor] Thank you, Josephine. I'm going to miss your splendid meals. - Oh, sure, you're welcome, welcome. - We will miss you, my friend. - And I will miss you all. - Oh, Victor, you are just like one of the family. You were here when I gave birth to my sons, and I wish you could be here for this one. - My friend, if we found you a wife, then would you stay? - That's a wonderful idea. - Ah, no, no, no, no, marriage is not for me. - Oh, but you'd do so well with a family. - [Josephine] Yes. - And you do well with children. - I know, as long as they're someone else's. (all laughing) I say, old bean, but I really must go. My heart is calling for adventure and excitement. - Are you sure? Is there nothing we can say to help you stay? - I'm sure my spirit is ready to soar. - Oh, Victor, we'll miss you, you wild and crazy man. - Ah ha ha, crazy I am. - [Russell] Victor went off to seek new adventures. Along the way, he picked up a new Muscatel, his nephew Isaac. Josephine gave birth to a girl named Donna, who grew up to be a beautiful young lady, and her three sons, Jerome, Peter, and Thadius, grew up to be handsome young men. John was happy he married Josephine, but he missed the fun of being a Muscatel. Anyway, let's just say that 20 more years have passed by. And back in Spain, King Alberto Nacho is ready to kick the bucket. (dramatic music) (laughs maniacally) - My father, my father, you sent for me? - Yes, my son, since I won't be with you much longer, there's something I must tell you. - Please, do not speak this way, my father. - The medallions that I gave your sister's husband and his friend possess great powers. - I do not understand, Father. - When the two halves are joined beneath the picture of me in the banquet room and the light strikes the medallion, it will open the doors to great treasures and powers. The deed to the wine country in there, too. You will need all of these things to continue ruling in peace and prosperity. - Yes, my father. - Send a messenger to your sister. Have her return with her husband and his friend. You will need them to carry on after I'm gone. - Yes, my father. - I have also discovered the enemy within. - Father, I do not want you to go. - I don't want to go either, son, but this is the big one. (coughing) But before I go, I must tell you something. Count. - Count what, father? - Count. - Count the treasures. Count the vineyards. (King Alberto coughing) Count the subjects. Count, count, count, count what, Father? - Count (choking). (dramatic music) - [Russell] Meanwhile, back in France, Victor and his nephew Isaac take a break from adventures and visit the Oui Oui Brothel. - Where are all our horses? - So you are the two fools, huh? There are your horses. - Are you responsible for this? - Oui. - You will die for this. - [Both] En garde. (groaning and shouting) - Stupid little fools. - It's a big fellow over there, isn't he? - Yes, he's very strong. - I think maybe we should investigate. Come, Isaac. - Madeline, if anyone else approaches, and I mean anyone, you tell them not to tie their horse next to mine. - I will, sir. - Isaac, we shall tie our horses here as we always have. - Oh, Uncle Victor. - Tie the horses, Isaac. - You must be deaf, little man, or a fool ready to leave this world. - Neither, but no oversized beast shall tell me where to tie my horse. - Then I shall knock you down and throw you to the winds. - Speaking of wind, it seems to flow quite freely from your mouth. - (laughs) That sword will not save you. - Shall I cut him, Uncle Victor? - No, Isaac, no, Isaac, stop stuttering. - [Isaac] You got the big puppy now. - I have played with you long enough. Your head seems to be rather hard. Perhaps it's better suited for another world, perhaps the one above. - [Isaac] Uncle, Uncle Victor, please. - If you put down that sword, I shall squash you like a mud pie. - I believe you said if, windbag, but it does seem a bit unfair, so I shall put it away. I lied, I lied, I lied, I lied, I lied. I lied, I did lie. - Sir, no man has ever had victory over me. May I follow you and your nephew? - What do you think, Isaac? - [Isaac] I think he would make a fine Muscatel, Uncle Victor. - Ah, ha ha, then a Muscatel you are, come, come, come. - [Charles] A Muscatel? - [Victor] Come, come. - Welcome back, Victor. Welcome! - Thank you, Madeline. - [Isaac] Have you ever had your head busted? - [Charles] No, head busted? (glass clatters) (Charles yells) - [Isaac] Now you are officially a Muscatel. - [Russell] The Muscatels did not stay long. They decided to go to Victor's hometown in England. Back in Spain, the evil Count Baltimore killed King Nachos I and II and took over the castle. - (laughs) Juan, Chi Chi is lovely, you were correct. - Yes, I know. - Listen, I want you or one of your men to follow the prince's messenger, kill John Bon Viant. (both laughing) And bring his half of the medallion to me. I will reward you handsomely. - Yes, General, but can I kill both men? - No, no, Juan, just one for now. - (scoffs) Okay, but promise I can kill the other one later. - Alright, Juan, you can kill the other later. - Ah, thank you, consider it done, my general. - Then off with you, ta-ta. Now, Chi Chi, Juan tells me you have a way with certain kinds of men. - I have a way with all kinds of men. - Ah, I believe you, Chi Chi, but do not fail me. I am sending you to England to bring back the other half of the medallion from a man named Victor Langford. Oh, he loves wine and women. I've known about the brothel he visits for years, but I cannot go back to England. I'm wanted there. - I am also wanted. - Hmm. - And I love it. - Yes. - And I will get your medallion. - Wonderful. - But I want half my money up front. - What? (sighs) Here. - And the other half when I return with the medallion. - Just bring back the medallion. - Just have my money. - (laughs) Yes. - [Russell] Juan Perez caught the messenger and Josephine never received the letter. (groaning and screaming) (Juan laughs) - [Peter] Mother, the food is good. - Oh, you like it? - Where is Donna? - Your father took her to town to buy a new dress. - (laughs and spits) A dress? - Yes. - A tomboy in a dress? (all laughing) - Oh, Father, thank you so much for the beautiful dress. I just love it. - It was time, my lovely daughter. You've looked like a tomboy long enough. - Oh, Father, don't tease me, I try to be a girl. (John sniffing) What? - I smell something (sniffs). I smell danger. - Where? Oh, stop it, Father. - I smell Spanish bandits. - Oh, no. - You must take this medallion. Your grandfather said it was very valuable. You must keep it with you always. - [Bandit] There's John Bon Viant! - Go, get your butt out. (bandits whooping and laughing) - Shut up, the girl, she got away. - You idiot, I heard her say she was going to get her brothers. Take him over there, we'll get them later. (bandits laughing) (brothers laughing) - Hurry, hurry, get up, Father has been attacked. - [Brothers] By who? - The Spanish bandits. - Donna, you stay here with Mother. - No. - Donna, please. - Donna, you must stay here and protect Mother. - Father taught me to use a sword and to fight. I am going to. - Well, I am going, too. - Mother, Father would want for Donna and you to remain here. - Mother, please let us handle this. - Stay, Mother, please. - Alright, we will stay, but if you do not come, we will come looking for you. - Let us prepare to go. ♪ We are the great Bon Viant brothers (grunt) - Get out of here. Mother, Father gave me this medallion. - Yes, it was your grandfather's. Keep it close to your heart. - I will. I will look from afar. - You promise? - I promise. - Take care, my child. - I will. (men laughing) - [Juan] Alright, bring him right here. - No more, please. - [Juan] Alright, Bon Viant, where is your family? - I will tell you nothing, Juan Perez. - [Juan] Okay, get him. - No! (men laughing) (John yelling) - Wait, wait. He's dead. - Good. You, go get the other bandits and find his sons. - Okay, Juan. - Go! You are a great and wonderful leader, Juan Perez. - [Juan] Yes, I know. - Yes, you are. - [Juan] Ha, if it wasn't for you, we would have the medallion. (groans) (laughing maniacally) - What are you laughing at? (Juan yells) (bandit groans) (laughs) (crickets chirping) - [Man] Move. - My brothers have been kidnapped. And there's more. - More? - Yes, a man named Juan Perez has killed my father. - (gasps) How did he die? - He died laughing. - Well, that was always your father's weakness. That Juan Perez, that evil Juan Perez. He was the man who held me hostage. - When you were the princess in Spain? - Yes, Donna, you must find your uncle Victor. He will help rescue your brothers. - I don't even know the man. I don't even know where the man is, Mother. - You can find him in England, at the famous brothel. Yes, we must prepare. First, sit down. Perez and his men will be looking for us. I will hide with the neighbors. I have a plan, but you must promise me to please keep the medallion safe. - Oh, I will, Mother. - I'm sorry, but I must do this. - Oh, the things I do (groans). - Donna, I'm so sorry. - Give me your attention. Presenting Miss Chi Chi Jua Jua. - [Crowd] Ooh. - Who is Victor Langford? - Oh, me. - Me! - [Victor] Who wants to know? - I want to know, and if you come from behind all those stale things, maybe you'll see something fresh that you like. - Your big man does look rather fresh but I'm not interested. (crowd laughing) - Victor, who is she? - Well, everybody knows Victor has a different wench in every land. - Move. Perhaps, now, Senor, you'll see I am beautiful. All the men, they love me. They love my eyes. They love my hair. - Oh. - Yeah. - They love my luscious lips, because I am the sexiest Spanish woman that ever walked this earth. I am the famous Chi Chi Jua Jua. - [Men] Chi Chi Jua Jua! - Now that you see Chi Chi, what do you think? - I see. - Now that she touches you, what do you think? - Well, I, I-- - Now that she holds you, what do you think? - I think whatever Chi Chi wants, Chi Chi gets. - What is this old medallion around your neck? - Nothing, Chi Chi, it's nothing. - Shall we go beyond gazing eyes? - Uh, this way, Chi Chi, this way. - Ooh! - Victor's a lucky one. (Victor laughs) (men laugh) - [Russell] Three minutes later? Is that right, three minutes later? That Chi Chi must be some ba-boo-gie. (speaking foreign language) Chi Chi Jua Jua. Oh. - [Man] Bet she's a little devil. - Chi Chi will have only one game now. - [Man] Chi Chi Jua Jua. - I hear there's not a swordsman in this whole inn. - So, is that what you hear? - Yes, that's what I hear. - Let's teach this lad some respect. - En garde. (swords clattering) (crowd laughing) (fighters groaning) (fighter yelling) - [Charles] I think you fight like a wild one, huh? - [Isaac] Shall we join in? - Oui, yes, come on. (swords clattering) (fighters groaning) - Oh, Victor, do you see this plain fellow? - He fights like a girl, huh? - He's well-trained, but not a man for all seasons. He reminds me of a faggot. - A faggot, what's a faggot, Uncle Victor? - A man who cannot remember whether he's a man or a woman, because he forgot. - Who is next? - [Victor] Boy, we've seen you can handle a sword. - Shut up. - [Isaac] Victor! - [Donna] Come, en garde. - Teach him, Uncle Victor. You are no match for Victor. - Aha (laughs), where did you get that medallion? - From my father. I am the son of John Bon Viant. My name is Dorian. My brothers have been kidnapped, and my father has been killed by a man named Juan Perez. I need your help, Uncle Victor. - You are the son of John Bon Viant? - Yes, I am the youngest son. You had left before I was born. - I remember this Juan Perez. We must go, Muscatels. Come, come, Dorian. (dramatic music) - I don't want to stop here, I want to go on. I want to find my brothers now. - You know, Dorian, I have noticed that you complain a lot. What is wrong with you? - You want to drink now? - No, I want to initiate you to make you an official Muscatel. - I don't want to be a Muscatel. I want to find my brothers now. - You're going to be a Muscatel if you're going to ride with us. Charles, will you do the honors, please? - I will be happy to do so. - I don't want to-- (dramatic fanfare) - Ah, ha, ha! (men laughing) - [Donna] You think that is funny? - Ah, yes, I do. (Donna groans) Look at the little one. (Muscatels laughing) (dramatic music) (mid-tempo bluesy music) - [Isaac] Dorian, stop, I think Charles has had enough. - Come, come, lad, you were very brave. Now you're officially a Muscatel, come, come, come. Charles, how about some wood for the fire, please? - Oui, Victor. - And Isaac, how about some food? How about a nice, plump rabbit? - Yes, a rabbit. - No, no, no, a bird, bird, chicken, chicken. - Chicken? - Chicken. - Uncle Victor, we had chicken yesterday and the day before. - Isaac, chicken, chicken, chicken. - I don't know why black people like chicken so much. - So tell me, how do you come to know my father? - Actually, your father saved my life. I was being attacked by these 50 rogues, oh, no, 75, maybe it was 100, and there I was, a sword in each hand, fighting like a madman, and suddenly, your father came seemingly from nowhere. And pretty soon, we had quelled the situation. Then, after that, we went to this tavern. I think it's, uh, Russ Muscatel, that was the old chap's name. We went in there, the muscatel was so fine, he initiated us, or knighted us, as Muscatels. And then after that, your father and I, we roamed the countryside, going here and there and everywhere. - Save that story, I want to go help the others. I'll listen to you later. - But Dorian, you didn't hear the best part of it. Let me see, I think, maybe we had 150 men. I don't know, maybe 200. - What are you doing? - Shh. - What are you doing? - I am trying to catch the chicken. - How do you know this Victor? - He's my uncle. My parents died when I was young, and he took me under his wing. I have been with him ever since. - You think he could help me find my brothers? - Oh, yes, he drinks a lot, but he knows what he's doing. - I don't know. Oh, the chicken is coming. - Oh, Dorian, you are too loud. You scared the chicken away. - I was only trying to help you. - Go, go, go away, go and talk to Charles, go away. - Charles? - Yes, Dorian. - I want to apologize for the way that I attacked you today. - That is alright, you and I are Muscatels, and I am proud of you, you know. - How did you get to be so strong? - I've always lived on a farm and worked very hard. - You remind me of my brother. - Really? - He has muscles, but they are not as big as yours. (Charles scoffs) How did you meet Victor? - I met Victor at the Oui Oui Brothel. He is the only man that has ever defeated me, and that is why I admire him so. - Mm, I bet he admires you, too. (Charles scoffs) I will help you with the wood. Will you show me how to build my muscles like yours? - What is wrong with you? - I, I, I don't know, I just, I lost myself. - Then pick up some wood and find yourself. - What on earth is that concoction you're sipping? - (laughs) This is the best wine, muscatel, this side of the Rhine river. Please, sit down, enjoy. Take a sip. (man sighs) (men laugh) That's good, but you need to work on your laugh more. Drink more, take a sip. (laughing loudly) Oh, Monsieur does it good, you will need more wine. Whoa, whoa, whoa, your laugh is a little shaky. Now, take a deep suck on this. Deep down, come on. (men laugh) Very good. (laughs) Monsieur, this is the best muscatel ever in France, and this is good money. (dramatic music) Chi Chi Jua Jua returns Victor's medallion to Count Baltimore and gets her money. (Baltimore laughing) Back in France, the Muscatels continue searching for Dorian's brothers. - I think we should camp over there. (peaceful music) - [Charles Voiceover] I think something is wrong with me. I feel strange around this fellow Dorian. - Father, thank you for the beautiful dress, I love it. - [John] It was time, my darling daughter. You've looked like a tomboy long enough. - [Victor] Dorian, it will be night soon. Come, let us eat. - I am coming, Uncle Victor. - [Charles Voiceover] This cannot be. I must rid myself of this feeling. - That was an excellent job with the bird, Dorian. - Thank you, Uncle Victor. - Isaac, that was a fine shot. - Yes, the hunting was good today. - Let's save the bread for Charles because he eats very much. - He's hungry. - He's a big fellow, you know. - [Fluffy] Give me your money or your lives. - I'm not in the mood. I've had a rough day. - Well, I been robbing too long to listen. Now just give it up. - I'm not in the mood. - [Andre] Hey, hey, hey, you heard the big, fat, juicy girl. Now give it up. You, gimme that gold chain around your neck. (laughs) Don't be stupid. - You little ragged runt. - [Fluffy] That's final, I'll knock the boom out of you, and we'll kill you. - Take it easy, highway-woman, please, take it easy. Perhaps you've heard of us? We're the Muscatels. - And the next time I'm robbing somebody, I'll remember to mention y'all's names. - (laughs) Big Fluffy, that was funny. - Look, highway-woman, we've had a rotten night, and we're not going to take this kindly. - Kindly or unkindly, honey, what's yours is mine and what's mines is mine. - [Andre] And mine, now give it up, gimme the gold chain. Taking a new sword, too, give it. - [Isaac] Good work, Charles. - [Victor] Excellent work. - Don't mess with me, I am a Bon Viant (grunts). - Well, Bon Viant, uh, I was just joking. - If your feet were not so little, I'd take your shoes. - Ha, I keep this one, take them off. - [Andre] No, no, no, no, please, not my Adidas! No, please, stop, hey! (bandit yelling) (Muscatels laughing) - Look at the crybaby. - Look at him, crying little baby. - I think we've punished them enough. We'll allow them to leave. I want you out of here by the count of three. One. - Okay! - [Isaac] Two, three, go away, you scoundrel! - My shoes. - Let's go. - Go, go, go. (bandit crying) (Muscatels laughing) - [Isaac] So, let us finish our meal, huh? - And let's continue with our meal. Good work, Dorian, very good, excellent, excellent. Charles. - He's a little crybaby. Dorian. Dorian, we have noticed that you are very clean for a man. - Yes, my mother taught me to be this way. - It's obvious she had a great influence on you. - Yes, we were very close, but what is your point? - A man so clean makes other men nervous. - And? - Take Charles, for example. He's extremely nervous around you. - He is! I mean, he is? - Yes, yes, he is, but he'll get over it, because we're all for one and one for all. - That is good to know. - Dorian, have you ever been in love? - Yes, I think so, why do you ask? - Because there is a girl I have this feeling for. - Isaac, why are you stuttering? You never stuttered before. - Ah, I only stutter when I'm nervous or thinking about Cynthia. - Where is she? - She's at the Oui Oui Brothel, with her family. - Do you plan to marry her? - I want to, but our uncle Victor would be upset if I left the Muscatels. - Isaac, if you love her, you should follow your heart. - [Victor] Isaac, Dorian, it's time to go. - Where are we going? - We are going to the Oui Oui Brothel. - Oui Oui Brothel? I want to go find my brothers now. - We are, we are well-known at this brothel, and Uncle Victor thinks we might be able to obtain some information about the whereabouts of your brothers. And there I will see Cynthia. - Let us go quickly. - Introducing, Madame Dubois. ♪ When I was just a little girl ♪ My head was filled with dreams ♪ I thought that I could change the world ♪ But my mother says to me ♪ No, no, Gi Gi, no, no, Gi Gi ♪ This is not right for you ♪ No, no, Gi Gi, no, no, Gi Gi ♪ Dreams, they don't come true ♪ Loved a man with all my heart ♪ He turned my dark skies blue ♪ But my father said, upon my word ♪ He's no good for you ♪ No, no, Gi Gi, no, no, Gi Gi ♪ He is not right for you ♪ No, no, Gi Gi, no, no, Gi Gi ♪ Dreams, they don't come true ♪ My heart was torn ♪ My life was gone ♪ My hopes were almost through ♪ Until I fell upon this very place ♪ Now I make dreams come true ♪ Oui oui, Gi Gi, oui oui, Gi Gi ♪ This is all right for you ♪ Oui oui, Gi Gi, oui oui, Gi Gi ♪ I make dreams come true ♪ When you come to me in the night ♪ I treat you right ♪ I do special things for you ♪ Make your fantasy ring true ♪ Oui oui, Gi Gi, oui oui, Gi Gi ♪ This is all right for you ♪ Oui oui, Gi Gi, oui oui, Gi Gi ♪ I make dreams come, come true (crowd applauding and cheering) - Victor! Welcome back. - Madame! - And with a new Muscatel, I see. - Yes, we're glad to be back, Madeline. - The Muscatels, the Muscatels are here! - [Leroy] Ah, welcome back, my friends! - [Victor] We are glad to be back. - Sit here. - Yes. - [Leroy] It's good to see you again. - Yes, I always love when we come here. Sharon, are you still wearing those glasses and stealing purses from the customers? - No. - Come with me. - Leroy LeBlue and Elizabeth LeBlue, I want you to meet my best friend's son Dorian. - Greetings, Dorian. A friend of Victor's is a friend of the LeBlue family. - Welcome, Dorian, you look like a fine lad. - [Donna] Thank you. - Cynthia, introduce him to your other sisters. - Yes, Mama. Come with me, Dorian. - [Victor] Let us play cards. - Wait, I know you. You little ragged runt, what are you doing here? - I came to get, I came with Big Fluffy. - And you, where is your wig? - I don't have it anymore. I'm back to my normal self, after you all ran us off. I stopped robbing, and now I'm back to doing what I do best. - You have gotten taller. Oh, who did you steal those shoes from? - [Andre] My Adidas! - Don't you touch them, they're mine. I will give you to the count of five to get out of here, or I will call the other Muscatels. One. - Big Fluffy! Big Fluffy! - Two, three, four. Oh, out of here. - [Isaac] Fiery woman, ha ha, Big Fluffy. - Ah ha, they are still running. - They are bad thieves, my friends. - LeBlue, you are lucky. - You are cheating. - Yes, I am good. - Uncle Victor, when are we leaving? - Soon, LeBlue has won all of my francs. - And mine! - And mine. - If I should win your money back, then can we leave? - Right away. - Then move, Isaac, move. - I cannot play. - Leroy LeBlue, we shall play. - Well, my good fellows, I have a lovely surprise for you. - Nothing you do would surprise us. - Well, we'll see about that. Guardos. - Mother! - Ma! (dramatic music) - I've had quite enough of you Bon Viants. I don't want to hear any more. You know all you know who knows where your sister is. When I find her, I will kill her and whoever is helping her (laughs). Then, I will have the medallion and all the wealth. - They cannot escape, oh great Count Baltimore. Or should I say king? - Oh, king is fine, but we'll wait for that. She should be found soon. - We have hundreds and hundreds searching the countryside for them. - But I thought we only began with 60, but surely that will be enough to take care of those pompous peasants. They'll probably run away like roaches. - Uncle Victor will never run from anyone. - Uncle Victor would rather die in battle rather than run in defeat. - And if you face Uncle Victor, make sure your hundreds are present! - Uncle Victor, Uncle Victor, Uncle Victor. Who is this Uncle Victor that I should be afraid? Carlos, I want his head on a platter, and I want it now. - Right away, my count. My king, my king, my king. - And then torture another one. - No, no. - No! (brothers shrieking) (guards laughing) - Dorian, if I lose this hand, I will give you my virgin daughter, Cynthia, but if I win, you will give me back all the money, and you will work for me for two years. Do you accept? - Two years? - Two years. - I accept. - Then look at this and cry! - You are lucky, LeBlue. - No luck (laughs). - I will cry, but only after you cry. - (laughs) Dorian has won back our money. - You have won. Cynthia, go with Dorian. - Yes, Father. (crying loudly) - Do you love Isaac? - Yes. - Then stop crying and acting like a baby, and I will show you something. - Do not show me anything. - Look. - You're a girl! - Yes, but you must promise not to tell anyone. - I promise, okay. - Ooh, Victor is here, girls, come. (Victor laughing) - Victor, it's good to see you again. - Ladies, ladies, ladies! Wine, wine, more wine, wine! - It's been a long time. - [Victor] Ah, it has been a long time. - Oh, oui, oui, you're not a virgin anymore. - So we can put her to work like the other girls. - [Cynthia] But I am still a virgin. - What kind of man could not do the job? - [Group] Hmm. - Dorian is a (stuttering), you know. - A faggot? - A faggot? - Faggot? - A faggot. - Victor, Isaac called Dorian a faggot. - No, Charles, it's a faggot. - A faggot? - You mean your nephew is a faggot? - No, no, no, no, he is not really my nephew. He's my best friend's son. Let me see this vision of loveliness. - How are you, my lord? - Fare thee, fare thee. - Fare thee, my lord? - Ah, very well. - Does thine eye see something that I have that you want? - If all that I see is truly thine. - Truly thine, truly thine! My lord, I may be no mathematician, but I can assure you, I'm in need of no addition. Would you not agree? - Ah, completely. - Then why do you insult me? - I meant no insult. It's just that the winds of heaven that brought thee take my breast away, I mean, my breath away. - Perhaps I should close your foul mouth. - Mm, oh, close it, close it, for mankind, close it. For heaven's sake, close it. - We'll close it, eh? We'll close it. (bandits yelling) - Spanish bandits, help. - This is a warning to you Muscatels. - Yes, a warning. - Carlos don't play that. - [Bandits] We don't play that! - New sneakers, new sneakers, I like those. New sneakers, I like them. - Oh! (bandits laughing) (women shrieking) - Charles! Charles, oh, Charles, are you okay? - [Sharon] Pablo, what are you doing here? - Senor Victor, my friend's sister's mother-in-law Jacquelyn's cousin told my best man's friend Hector who told my oldest son, Tyrone-- - Please, Pablo, what is it? - One-tenth of Juan Perez's men are coming back to get you. - How far behind you are they? - About one-third of one-fourth of one day. - We will stop them at the bend in the road. Muscatels, we have work to do, we must go! - Oh, can I go with you? - No. - Why? - [All] Because you talk too much. - Oh. - Uncle Victor, if they go back to the castle, I will be able to follow their trail. - That is a good idea, Isaac. - Farewell, little thief. I must go and fight these bandits. - [Sharon] Be careful, Charles! - Oh, shut up, you whore. Goodbye! - You faggot. - Victor, one of these days, you're going to make it up those stairs. - Ah, the thought put my enemy at a great disadvantage. I shall see you soon, farewell. - Farewell, Victor. (Victor laughs) Farewell, Victor. - We'll miss you! - Goodbye! - We'll miss you! - [Russell] The Muscatels went after the Spanish bandits. (dramatic music) (bandits laughing) - Let's play some cards, huh? - You guys cheat! - Not at cards (laughs). - Hey, hey, hey, man. Didn't we kick the Three Muscatels in the booty last night? - (laughs) They'll never mess with us again. - Yeah, man. - Hey, hey, they will not mess, homie don't play that! (bandits groaning) (Dorian screams) - Dorian! - Dorian. - I, I killed a man, but he is not dead. Get up! - Get up, you stupid little fool. Victor, make him talk. - [Victor] Speak or die. - Count Baltimore killed King Nacho I and King Nacho II. He would kill King Nacho III, but there was none. He is holding the Bon Viants (grunts) inside the castle dungeon. He sent us to find the missing Bon Viant, because he feels that that one has the missing medallion. - Why is the medallion so important? - When you join the two halves together in front of the king's picture in the banquet room, it releases great wealth and power. - [Victor] How many men does Perez command? - Ooh, many, senor. He has his men and many more from King Nacho's men. - How many is that? - Let me see now, there must be about (speaking foreign language) about 35 men. - [Victor] We can handle that many, I think. - Uncle Victor, I think we should find a new trail to the castle. - Isaac, I agree. Charles, silence the prisoner. - My pleasure. (bandit groans) - [Victor] Do you see a path, Isaac? - Only trails of animals this way. I think this way is safe. - Lead on, Isaac. - So, Dorian it is. But I know how to take care of him (laughing). - [Russell] The Muscatels continued traveling through Spain, but they soon came across a strange territory. (Victor shouts) - [Isaac] It's a very, very strange place, Uncle Victor. - [Charles] I think we should investigate, huh? - [Victor] Uh-huh-huh-huh. (Donna shouts) - [Isaac] (groans) I've fallen and I can't get up. - [Charles] Come on, Isaac, get up, come. Keep moving. Come, Dorian. - [Isaac] Whoa, this place is lopsided, man. - [Victor] A very strange place. I'm not familiar with this land, but I think we're someplace in Spain. (Donna shouts) (Isaac groans) - Isaac, are you okay? - I hate this place. - Dorian! - [Victor] Charles, help young Dorian. - I will. - Hopefully, we'll find some water soon. - [Donna] I will be okay, I am just so thirsty. - To be a faggot or not? Have I forgot? Wait for me, I'm coming. (ominous music) - [Isaac] Uncle Victor, can we rest for a little while? - [Victor] Yes, Isaac, this is a good place. - [Donna] I am so thirsty. - [Victor] I thought someday I'd be pierced by a greater sword, but to die in a foggy marsh of thirst is not how I thought it would end. It really takes the uh out of my uh-huh-huh-huh. - [Isaac] Uncle Victor, I must tell you something. - [Victor] What is it, Isaac? - [Isaac] I, I am in love with Cynthia LeBlue. I was planning to leave the Muscatels to marry her. I did not discuss it with you, because I thought that you would be upset. - [Victor] Isaac, I love you like a son, and if marrying Cynthia made you happy, I would share in your happiness, for the life we live is no life for a man in love. - [Isaac] Thank you, Uncle Victor. - [Charles] I, too, have a confession. Victor, I've loved you like a father, and Isaac, I've loved you like a brother, but Dorian, I cannot find the words to express how I feel. - Wait, do not finish. I, too, have a confession to make. I, I am a (stuttering). - [Muscatels] Faggot. - No, no. ♪ Water, water ♪ If you seek water, follow me - [Victor] Who is it? - [Charles] What is it? - [Victor] If that's not a voice in our minds, we must follow it. - Let us go. - No. - Uncle Victor, you know that you are the oldest and the wisest. I think you should lead the way. - Yeah, uh-huh. - I will lead. - You go, you go, go. - Come, Dorian. - No. - Come. - No! - [Charles] Come on, come. - No, they're going to get us. No, too hard to walk. - [Charles] Come, Dorian. (Muscatels screaming) - Do not be afraid. You must lean sideways and walk at an angle. - [Muscatels] Lean sideways and walk at an angle. (whimsical music) - [Frenchy] Jonathan, our leader. - Charles! - He's a big one, ooh. - [Jonathan] Bring them water. Welcome, Muscatels. - [Isaac] He knows who we are. - How do you know who we are? - I have been following and watching.

You are just as dead. (fighters shouting) - Talk is cheap, hand me the medallion. - What, this old thing? Why, I've had this for years. Did you think I would fight you fair, you fool? I remember your blades and doubt if they have grown dull. - I always liked fighting at a disadvantage. - You little runt, I'm going to poke your eyes out and stuff doo-doo in it (laughs). - Can you doo-doo this?

Why don't you give me the medallion, Count, and we'll just-- - I would rather trip, roll over, fall down, and break my neck than to give you what belongs to me. Oh, can't you see I'm busy?

But Donna, do you still have the medallion? - Yes, Mother, it is here. - Victor, come, come. - [Victor] What is it, Josephine? - There is something we must do. - Yes, we must get the treasure.

I told you about that. Donna, you know, I've been thinking. I'm sorry about what I said to you earlier today. - I'm sorry, too. - Can I make it up to you? - Yes. - Would you like to go to lunch? - Sounds good to me. - Come on, let me get your stuff, let me help you.
