23.976 English Sup-rip ? 26.11.2019 Ordeal by Innocence (1984) - Mr. Argyle? - Mr. Argyle is in the library. - Does he expect you, Mr... - Calgary. No. If you would tell him that I have come with his address book... Mr. Leo Argyle's address book? No. Mr. Jack. Jack Argyle. Come in. I'll tell him you're here. Will you wait here? Will you come this way please, Mr. Calgary? Don't be alarmed, Calgary. None of them is loaded. It never fails to impress me, that. What? Weaponry? No, good grammar. None of them is. I never get it right. Always say none of them are. Arthur Calgary. Sit down, will you? - Nice, nice collection you have here. - Oh, thank you. It's more than that. I'm actually compiling what I hope will be the definitive reference work on small arms. Their history, manufacture and use. Miss Vaughan, my secretary, undertakes a good deal of my field research. How do you do? Arthur Calgary. You don't feel threatened with all these weapons, hmm? Oh, guns run in our family. I can trace at least four generations of Argyles who were gunsmiths. In any case, I thought you Americans felt quite at home with guns. Yes, not quite this many. So you have come with Jacko's address book, have you? At long last, yes. - When did you find it? - Two years ago. - Were you a friend of Jacko's? - No, it's a bit silly, really. I gave him a lift to Plymouth. I was... Sailing the next morning. I was part of the Hayes-Bentley expedition and... He must have dropped it in the car. My oversight really. It ended up going to the Antarctic and back. So I felt I should complete the trip. I went to school with Charlie Hayes. I'm surprised you ever got there. Hmm. When did you leave? February? March? The expedition? March 16th. And you gave Jacko a lift the night before? In the evening, yes. - Are you sure of that? - Yes, of course I'm sure. 6:55 to be precise. I checked the time when he got in the car. We had assembly on the boat at 7:30, and I'm never late. Never. I see. Well, thank you for taking the trouble of returning it. Well, I had hoped to have the opportunity to present it to him personally, um, and explain. Is that not possible? Can I see him? My son is dead, Dr. Calgary. I'm, I'm dreadfully sorry. He was hanged... No. For murdering his mother, my wife, on March the 15th, two years ago, between 7:00 and 7:30. He was with me between 7:00 and 7:30. Jacko always claimed he was hitching a lift at the time. None of us ever considered the possibility that he might be speaking the truth. Because nobody came forward to prove his alibi. Well, if you are right about the time, it appears you were his alibi. The case must be reopened. It's not for you to decide, Dr. Calgary. If you would care to leave your name and address, the police and our solicitors will be in touch with you in due course. Thank you and goodnight. Why did you come here? You don't know this family. You don't know what they went through with Jacko, and after. You can't bring him back into their lives. Why bring him back into their minds? Oh, God! Dr. Calgary! - Was he really innocent? - Who are you? Jacko's sister. I'm so sorry. Yes, he was. Can they really hang you for something you didn't do? - I didn't believe they could. - No, I didn't. Jacko deserved it. To be dead? Never. Just because he's dead doesn't change how he was. - What kind of a doctor are you? - I'm a paleontologist. I see. No, you don't. Paleontologists look at fossils. They pick up rocks and they can tell you what life was like five million years ago. That's what I do. Dr. Calgary, if I give you this stone, could you see what this family was like two years ago? "Statement. Arthur Calgary. "At 6:55 p.m. on the evening of March the15th, 1956, "I gave a lift to a young man who was hitchhiking into Torquay. "I subsequently learned he was Jack Argyle." Now, did he tell you his name? No, no, it was in the address book. In the front. And did Mr. Argyle ask you to come here today? No, not exactly, no. And you know, of course, it's up to the family to apply to the Home Secretary to have the case reopened. Don't you think you could have waited? If I'd acted immediately before, Inspector, that lad would not have been hanged. I have lectures, I'm due back in the States. I didn't want it to slide. I feel... - Didn't anybody check his alibi? - We're not idiots, Mr. Calgary. Everybody's alibi was checked very thoroughly. In fact, Jacko's defense counsel thought his alibi sounded phony... So, without you, he could not account for the crucial half hour between Mrs. Argyle being seen alive, and the discovery of her body. You've got a remarkable memory for times, Mr. Calgary, two years later. I keep notes. How was he supposed to have done it? The boy? Well, he smashed her over the head with a poker. Not a pretty sight... And he'd been heard to threaten her earlier that evening. They were having a violent row about financial matters. She had stopped his allowance. She was even prepared to cut him out of her will. We were satisfied that no intruder was involved, and we knew Jacko. We were trying to make a bookmaking charge against him stick. Excuse me, sir. Excuse me. Right, where were we? We have to wait for direction from the Home Office. We can't just reopen a case without new evidence. New evidence? You have new evidence. I'm new evidence. He couldn't have done it because he was with me at the time. My God, a man has been wrongly hanged. Doesn't that mean anything to you? There's something I think you ought to know. I was in charge of that case. Hello, Miss Vaughan. Dr. Calgary, you're back. I have to see Mr. Argyle about what we can do about having Jacko officially declared innocent. Why should that concern you? That boy's on my conscience, Miss Vaughan. If, if I hadn't gone to the Antarctic, then... We must have made a mistake, Dr. Calgary. You must have been wrong about the time you picked him up. Miss Vaughan. Did Inspector Huish tell you to say that? What? I tried to make a report to the police. It's like talking to a brick wall. You had no business doing that. You should have left it to Leo. I got to go, miss. You're interfering in our lives. It was settled. Jacko was no good. He'd have done anything to get what he wanted. He was innocent. - His innocence matters. - What about us? How much do we have to suffer to prove our innocence? You don't understand, Dr. Calgary. You shouldn't even try to understand. Is Mr. Calgary staying here long? Leaves in the morning, as far as I know. Interested in him, are you? Not if he leaves in the morning. Ah. There's something I think you ought to know. I was in charge of that case. Ah! Calgary. Oh, that was careless. Hope I didn't startle you. I took you for a poacher. Is that what you do with poachers? Shoot them like rabbits? Oh, these? Oh, merely a little vermin control. It's important to preserve the right balance. - Don't you think? - Not at the expense of justice. A concept rather lost on rabbits, I suspect. I hate to see anything die that doesn't have to. That's the trouble with capital punishment, there's no room for error. We seem to have come back to the subject of my son. Because the police don't show the slightest interest in reopening the case. I doubt they took very kindly to an outsider telling them their business. Like everybody else, they look on Jacko as the ideal solution. My God, man, he was your son. Jacko... Jacko was lost to me and to himself. He lacked a single saving grace, such as common decency. Maybe all he lacked was the opportunity to show it. You know, old chap, you really can seem quite patronizing at times, can't you? The police won't do anything until your solicitors apply to the Home Office. Will you instruct them to do that? That's rather up to them, don't you think? If they feel the evidence is such that I should... They won't do anything until you say so. Perhaps you should stick to the main drive in future, Dr. Calgary. These woods could prove fatal. You should have left it to Leo. "This address book is the property of Jack Argyle, "viper's Point, Devon, England, Great Britain, "Western Hemisphere, The World." "Philip and Mary Durrant, Gatehouse, Argyle Point." I made the dire mistake of marrying a war hero. Two years after we were married, he got himself shot down. He's been in a chair ever since, or in those. How is it possible that someone could not care that your brother was wrongly hanged? Was he really so detestable? Oh, he had charm when he needed it. And when that didn't work, he had guts, more than anyone else around here. Then I don't understand. An impossible situation was over. When he was hanged? Yes. A very convenient solution for all of us until you arrived. I suppose we're all suspects now. We all should be. Oh, my God. Of course, there was no intruder, was there? Someone in the family must have done it. One of you must have killed your mother. I could have killed her you know. Try it. I won't tolerate scandal. I love you Mary, but you're not capable of making sensible decisions. When have I ever had the opportunity? And if you leave, I'll write you out of the trust. You won't see a penny of it, and neither will Philip. Oh, yes. I had good reason. Do you think I could have a glass of scotch, please? Oh, yes, please, help yourself. I was going to leave Philip. You see, I'd been having an affair. Well, I don't love Philip. I haven't for years. He's weak and he's feeble. He's destroyed my life. You're totally selfish. And you're not. I'm going away with Charles and I don't care how it looks because I want my chance. Try it. I was trapped. I couldn't leave. Boy, oh, boy. Well, I guess I'd better go talk to the rest of this family. - Micky Argyle? - Yeah. - I'm Arthur Calgary. - Oh, yeah. Thought you might be. Come in. Come through. Er, Tina, this is er, this is Mr. Calgary. If you ever need an alibi, don't count on him. Oh, Mr. Calgary, er, meet my sister. Hello. How do you do? So you haven't found our family grieving for poor, wrongly condemned Jacko? You won't. They're too bloody comfortable thinking he did it. You're about the worst thing that could happen. So they tell me. What were you doing in the Antarctic for two years? I was researching evidence of the continental drift. Do you mind if I turn that down a little bit? Did you, er, get on well with your brother? We shared an equal dislike for the family and its self-righteousness. Only our motives were different. He wanted the trust fund, and I just wanted out. An equal dislike for the family, or for your mother? Oh, Rachel was the family. Perfection on the surface, and underneath the sort of personality that made you so angry with yourself, so frustrated inside, you just wanted to kick out, kick so hard it hurt. It would make you want to kick out, it wouldn't make you kill. Look, Professor, why don't you just go back to your fossils and your bloody continental drift, and leave us alone? Nobody's going to thank you. They just want you to go away and stop your snooping. They hanged your brother. They hanged him for something one of you did. Somebody got away with murder just because I wasn't here at the right time. That's not how it's gonna be. No, that's how it is, that's how it bloody well is, this whole damn country. Anything can happen, but if you've got enough money, you can cover it up. You think you can do something about it? Come off it, Professor. It took you two years to find the address book. Miss Argyle. Don't let Micky shock you. He likes playing games. We're not brother and sister, well, not in the real sense. We were all adopted. You're adopted? The whole family. Go outside and play now, Micky. Your mother and I want to talk. - When are we going home, Mom? - Go on, Micky. Rachel couldn't have any children of her own so she bought herself a nice little family by adoption. Micky's right about one thing. Nothing's going to happen. Leo will see to that. Leo? We'll see. Come off it, Professor. It took you two years to find the address book. Mr. Calgary. That car just tried to run me down! Did you see him? Are you sure? He tried to kill me, for Christ sakes! Don't you think you've got this all out of proportion? - I mean, this is England, Mr. Calgary. - This is England? Why don't you just go back to your hotel room and pack your bags? Aren't you leaving tomorrow? Is that what you said when Mrs. Argyle was murdered, "This is England"? Goodnight, Calgary. - Hello? - Room 19, please. I was supposed to be leaving tomorrow, but I'd like to stay a couple of extra days, all right? I'm nights, sir. You'll have to talk to the manager in the morning. Yeah, well, you can leave a message, can't you? Night, sir. Goodnight. Oh, he had charm. And when that didn't work, he had guts. Maureen? Uh-huh. You knew Jack Argyle? Better than you did, obviously. I was his wife. - Why'd you want to know? - Oh, your name was in his address book. Could I... Could I talk to you for a couple of minutes? Yeah. Hang on, I've got to look around. - What are you looking for? - Oh, anything people leave behind. Are you the police? No, it's a little more complicated than that. I'm the missing witness. I'm, er, I was his alibi. He was in a car with me when his mother was being killed. Yeah? He didn't do it and I can prove it. So? So? So, he was innocent. He didn't kill his mother. Look, it doesn't make much difference now, does it? Not to him, anyway. You thought he'd done it, did you? I was surprised that he was supposed to have picked up that poker and bashed her. They all thought he was uncontrollable. He wasn't. Jacko was always in control. Always. He was capable, all right. You should have seen the bruises he gave me. Scared the hell out of me sometimes, but it wasn't temper. He liked it. The, er... Did he tell you that he had been adopted? He mentioned it. I don't think it mattered to him. He would have treated them the same if they had been real family. They were scared of him, you know. They all were. The only one he had any time for was the housekeeper. Jacko kept our marriage quiet. They wouldn't have approved. I don't think he approved, really. I just suited him at the time. You're going to want to talk to me again, aren't you? Um, maybe, yeah, yeah. - D'you want my number? - All right, thanks, yes. Yeah. I'm usually there nights after the last show. Call me? Yeah. Thanks. Thank you. She turned up here the day after. Wanting to see Mr. Argyle. I thought she was lying, coming here asking for money, but it was all so muddled. - Did you take her to see him? - Yes. He was surprised. Jacko had never mentioned her. It wasn't a real marriage. He had other women. I saw him one night in the town with Mrs. Leach. Hester. You have a too vivid imagination. You know perfectly well you're not allowed out at night. Mrs. Leach? He worked with Mrs. Leach. Her husband was, is, a bookie of sorts. Jacko was involved with him somehow. - Did he make money from it? - Never enough. He lived on credit, but even that didn't help. He had a talent for getting himself into tight corners over money and getting out again. He's looking into the past. Well, that's not a very sensible occupation. The past is sometimes better left alone. I suppose you want to know what I was doing at the time it all happened. That was my first thought. I was right here with Kirsten, peeling potatoes or chopping vegetables or something. I left Hester here in the kitchen and went up to get Mrs. Argyle's coffee cup. I found her. She was already dead, but I called for an ambulance in any case. Kirsten was a nurse before she came here. What about Mrs. Argyle's money? - That's family business. - You have no right to ask me that. I, I didn't mean how much. I meant the will. How did people expect to share in it? Oh. Well... When Mrs. Argyle died, the money was to be divided equally among all the children. But shortly before... Shortly before the murder, she made some alterations. Come in, Kirsten. I'd just like you to witness this. I've made some changes to my will. Our arrangement remains quite separate. You'll still receive your annuity. If you'll just sign here, my dear. Any more trouble with the police, anything, and I'm cutting Jacko out of the will. It's the only way to stop him. Do you think that unreasonable? He's never very reasonable with you, is he? Nobody knew it then, but he already had a criminal charge hanging over him, so he probably wouldn't have got the money, no matter how she died. The only one he had any time for was the housekeeper. I don't love Philip. He's weak and he's feeble. Mr. Durrant? Mr. Calgary? Come in. Come in. Sit down, sit down. The man with the mission. Well, we can slander the entire family in privacy. I thought that... Oh, that I'd be a valuable source of peripheral detail, hmm? You might be right. - You married, Calgary? - No. I was, yes. I try not to let my wife get too close to the orchids. Well, the alcohol on her breath, it could endanger an entire species, hmm? What do you think of my little enterprise, Calgary, hmm? This one's a particular favorite of mine, Paphiopedilum Durrant. Bred it myself. Hardy bugger. Could withstand the entire Argyle family. You, er, you don't like the Argyles, huh? Like them? Like them? I don't know. Pretty uncharitable bunch. Altogether too keen on seeing Jacko hang for something I never thought he did, either. You didn't? Why? Why risk killing someone when he had a much more lucrative business here? What? What? He was blackmailing someone in the house. Blackmail? Well, I saw him one night, being paid off. Who was it? Oh, I don't know. It was a woman, I didn't see her face. That narrows the field down a bit, don't you think, Calgary? A woman. Er, was Tina living here then? Ah, I see you've met the family dissidents, eh? No... No, they had already left to pursue their mutual desires elsewhere. Hester! I swear, that girl would have been invaluable to British intelligence in the last war. There is, er, there's something else. Something else even the police don't know. Tina, she was here the night Rachel was killed. - Tina was here? - I saw her. Well, nobody else did, of course, but, er, she was here. You see a lot, Mr. Durrant. Well, I may not get around much, but... I make damn sure I know what's going on. Instinct for survival, Calgary. Hello, Mr. Calgary. Nice to see that you're still here. What are you doin'? I've just replaced this broken cylinder. I'm trying to make a statement about women and machinery. Not very successfully, I'm afraid. Would you like a cup of coffee? Yeah, I'd love one, if you have the time. - You don't have to finish that? - No, no, I'm happy to leave it. Micky's out. Why do you live like this? What, you think that we're nice rich middle class kids playing at being poor? Leo did offer us our share of the trust when Rachel died, but we wouldn't take it. Why not? Micky called it blood money. Yes. Perhaps it is a bit melodramatic. But in a sense, he's right. Do you want some milk? No, thanks. You see, we weren't just orphans that Rachel adopted. We were part of a war nursery that she set up for the evacuees. I mean, most of us had our own parents. When the war was over, she decided to hang on to as many of us as she could. She believed her money made her a better mother than the ones we already had. Than your own mother? No, your real parents would never accept that. Well, both my parents were dead, but Micky's weren't. He used to cry at night for his mother. Oh, God. He hated Rachel, and he hated the house. He just wanted to go home. You're sure this is acceptable to you? You won't be able to change your mind later. Quite honestly, I'm only too pleased. You can do much better by him than me. Would you like a check or would you prefer cash? Cash is easiest. All right, then, ?100. Of course, it wasn't really Rachel that he hated, it was his mother. But you cannot condone Mrs. Argyle's behavior. It was unforgivably callous. Micky. You having a party and I'm not invited? - How's it going, Professor? - Pretty good. And why do I get the feeling I've been talked about? Coffee? All right. Seriously, Micky, when I was at the house, Philip was talking about you. Ah, he must be reveling in it, watching all their doubts and suspicions rise to the surface. He has some doubts and suspicions of his own. Such as? Well, he said you were at the house the night of the murder. He says he saw you. I went to get some sheets. They were ours and I needed them. You've got to believe a story like that. - Did anybody see you? - No, I had a key. Did you get the sheets? - I changed my mind. - You changed your mind? Yeah, I think, er, I think what the Professor is getting at is that perhaps you saw someone yourself. Either that, or he thinks you did it. I heard something. I didn't see anything. I heard two voices. - I can't do it. - Of course you can. It'll be over so fast, she won't know. I'm afraid. Just do it. After, everything will be wonderful. How can you be so sure? Hmm. - Why didn't you tell the police? - Because I didn't know who it was. No, but you thought you knew, didn't you? You thought it was Leo and Gwenda. Yes. Yes, I suppose that's what I thought. - Morning. - Remember me? Inspector Huish. I can't forget you, can I? I want to have a word with you. There's a fella around town, a big, tall American... - I can't do it. - Of course you can. It'll be over so fast, she won't know. - I'm afraid. - Just do it. - After, everything will be wonderful. - How can you be so sure? You thought it was Leo and Gwenda, didn't you? Yes. Yes, I suppose that's what I thought. Come in. I know it's a little late to come calling, but, er... Have a drink. Some other time, thanks. I see you're a methodical man, Mr. Calgary, I'm impressed. I see also you're applying your working methods to the Argyle case. I guess a posthumous pardon wouldn't exactly be a feather in your cap, right, Inspector? Is that it? Is that why you refuse to take a fresh look at the facts? All right, you had Jacko's address book and obviously you gave him a lift. Could you not have been mistaken about the time? No, I was not mistaken. Now, come on. Even you can't remember details two years later, Mr. Calgary. If you're so concerned with details, Inspector, it's not "Mister", it's "Doctor". Well, Doctor, had it not occurred to you that he might have committed the murder before you picked him up? Has it not occurred to you he might be using you, using you as an alibi? Did you know Tina was at the house the night Mrs. Argyle was murdered? Have you any idea what you're doing by stirring all this up? Huh? Have you thought about the Argyles? That's my point. If Jack didn't do it, and nobody ever knows who did, they'll all suffer. They've suffered enough, Mr. Calgary. Will you just let me do it my way, huh? Would you prefer I spent me time digging up fossils for you? He had other women. I saw him one night in the town with Mrs. Leach. Leach. Sunshine Girl. I'll give you fives. Never mind him, I'll give you fives here. Even ten on Worried Times. Ten shillings on Worried Times. Ticket 175. Fiver on Worried Times, please. Thank you very much. Fiver, Worried Times. Two tens, Worried Times. ?5 on Worried Times, please. Five on Worried Times, ticket 177. Ten shillings, Ghoster. Ten shillings, Ghoster, ticket 178. Can I put a bet on Fay's Choice? Two shillings and six pence. Don't you mean half a dollar, sir? Go on, half a dollar, got it, guvnor, uh, 179. Are you Archie Leach? No, Archie couldn't get out of bed this morning, sir. Ten shillings on Ghoster, please, Archie. Ten shillings Ghoster. Fifty bob to ten Ghoster, ticket 180. Jack Argyle used to work for you, didn't he? What if he did? Well, the police were pressing charges about illegal bookmaking against him just before his mother was killed. Ghoster's off. Go on, move away. No, no, no, it's important. I figured you might know something about it. And they're off. I was the one who was pressing the charges, fiddling the books. He made out with what, 200 quid by the time he was finished. - Still, he got what he deserved. - Not if he didn't kill her. Oh, I don't mean that. I mean, him and my wife. Ooh, meant for each other, those two. Still, I don't know what he saw in her. - That's true, then they were, er... - Oh, yes. So what happened? She got up and went, a year ago now. I don't mind that so much. I always thought I could trust him. He used her to try and clear it with me. I didn't know that at the time, though. He offered to pay it back? She said, if I dropped the charges, he'd see me right. She seemed to think there was money coming from somewhere. - Did I win or lose? - What do you think? Thanks. Hold your fire! Ah! Hey! Dr. Calgary! Er, I'm so glad you decided to drop by. Well, I was in the neighborhood, so to speak. Oh, you've made quite an impression. We've had Inspector Huish with us all morning, chatting to everyone in the house about Tina. Remarkable what you can achieve if you stick at it, isn't it? Have you spoken with your solicitors? Great fun, this gun. It was developed from one of the very first automatics John Moses Browning ever made, which was blowback operated gas principal. This has recoil, which came a little later. Cut a man down at 50 yards. You don't want to know who murdered your wife? You know very well I know. It was Jacko. So you'll make no formal request to have the case reopened? Oh, I was quite satisfied with the conclusion. If Jacko was innocent, you let him hang, not me. - And Miss Vaughan? - What about Miss Vaughan? Well, she seems to be... More than just a secretary. Oh, yes, but not in the way you think. Gwenda, demonstrate the derringer for Dr. Calgary, will you? This is a rim-fire pistol, a popular pocket weapon from the 1830s onwards. A similar model was used to assassinate Abraham Lincoln. He was an American I believe much concerned with justice. A woman full of surprises, don't you think? And now, would you care to show Dr. Calgary the way out? I can't think of any reason which would justify a further visit, can you, Doctor? Not if you're happy living with a murderer in the family, no. Doesn't it worry you, not knowing who killed Mrs. Argyle? I wouldn't be able to sleep. I'd wake up shivering, wondering who might be there. I have a lock on my door, Dr. Calgary. And what do you care who might be there? Was Jack blackmailing you, Miss Vaughan? Well, he was blackmailing somebody in the house. I don't like what you're implying, Doctor. I think you've overstepped the mark even by your somewhat generous standards of behavior. And you think I should leave? I'll walk you to the gate. No. It's all right, I can find my own way out. Hello. Is that the boatyard? Can you come out? I'm stranded down by the point. All right, I'll come right away. Mrs. Durrant, fancy meeting you here. Well, well, well. You been shopping? I need an excuse to come over. Something to do with my time. - Can I get you a drink, sir? - Yeah, Bells, and a gin and tonic. A large one, I have tonic. So, how are we progressing? Well, I think I must be doing pretty well. Everybody wants me to leave town. As yet, that doesn't include me. As yet. Your drinks, sir. Thanks. Cheers. Cheers. Your husband's been a great help. That's good to hear. He told me that... Jack was blackmailing somebody in the family. Didn't know who. A woman. Well, it wasn't me. It might have been more interesting if it had been. Alas, I was with Philip that night. Any idea who it might be? What do you think? Gwenda. She seems to me to be the one with the most to lose. I came across on the ferry with her this afternoon. She's always struck me as being a very capable young woman. Yes, she struck me, too. Yes, I heard about that. Gwenda. I keep getting little pieces of information. A piece from Philip, a piece from Tina. Inspector Huish doesn't seem too interested in what Tina has heard, so far as he's interested at all. I don't think Tina told him anything. I think she was afraid that maybe one of the voices that she heard might have been Micky's. Tina should keep her doubts to herself. Hmm. No, I mean it. Somebody killed Rachel. Remember? Just a second. I won't tolerate scandal. Try it. Oh, Micky. Somebody killed Rachel. Oh, God, you scared me. Sorry. Tina? You caused this! If you hadn't come here, she'd still be alive! I know that. Inspector Huish... Please. My guess is two, possibly three blows to the side of the head with the wrench. They called me out. Death would have been instantaneous. They said the starter motor was dead. But they weren't there when you got there. She's been dead about three hours. I can be more accurate once I've carried out the post-mortem. I've got the wrench, Inspector. Take it to forensic. Now, will you be proffering charges or not? Against Micky? No. But you've just said he attacked you with a wrench. He didn't know what he was doing. He'd just found her. All right, all right, we'll sort this out at the station. Bring him here. He's not making much sense. His times are all out. I think he may be in shock. He didn't do it. He loved her. That's usually a pretty good motive for murder. I'm holding him for questioning. I'm not arresting him. Tying up the loose ends, are you, Professor? Get him out of here. You realize what you've done, eh? I mean, we're not pursuing some academic theory. This is real, pal. If it wasn't for you, she'd still be alive. If it wasn't for me telling you that she'd been to the house, she'd still be alive. That's what you think, is it? Right, I need a full statement from you. You're quite good at statements aren't you, Doctor? There was a young lady asking after you earlier this evening, sir. - Did she leave her name? - No. - What did she look like? - Like she'd be coming back, sir. I hope you found what you're looking for. You should be in that police cell, not Micky. Micky didn't do it, I'm sure of that. Why don't you go away before someone else gets hurt? There's nothing in any of these local newspapers to suggest any kind of real investigation into Mrs. Argyle's murder. Is that because everybody took it for granted that Jack had done it? Or did Mr. Argyle have enough influence around here to keep things nice and simple? What do you mean? I mean, the police must have known what was going on between Leo and Gwenda. They were already having an affair, weren't they? - Mr. Argyle's private life... - Private? He might have done his very best to try and keep it private, but he wasn't very successful. Jack knew all about it. He was blackmailing Gwenda. Who told you this? Dr. Calgary, you don't seem to understand. Mrs. Argyle knew about Gwenda. Do you enjoy it? Enjoy creeping around behind my back? You must. I can't believe you did it to further your career. - Rachel, I assure you... - Oh, you assure me? What did he say to you? That you were helping our marriage? Or was it just included in the list of your secretarial duties? Do you think a wife can't see what's going on? Perhaps it would be better if I come back later. The perfect ploy for the perfect secretary. You're not going, are you? Why don't you ask Leo for a reference? I'm sure he'll give you a good one. And I promise you, you're going to need it. She didn't leave. He wouldn't let her. Why should he? That way, neither of them knew exactly where they stood. It must be a woman. Micky, I... If it's about Tina, don't bother. But... I've made arrangements for a lawyer for you. I've already got one of them. I know. I just thought it might be better if you had somebody who wasn't retained by the family. It doesn't make any difference. I know you didn't do it. Oh, well, I'm all right, then, aren't I? What can go wrong? Look what happened to Jacko. Help me, Micky. It has to have been one of your family. No, I don't know. I grew up with these people. I didn't like them very much, but I didn't live in fear of my life. But one of them did it. Well, whoever it was must have come across on the ferry yesterday. What are you doing in here? You've no right to be in here. You're holding the wrong man. I'm releasing him. His alibi's been confirmed. On yer bike, son. Why don't you do some work and see if you can find a connection in all this? Well, why don't you go back to your research, Doctor, before your work permit expires? The Home Office doesn't recognize you as a detective. There's the door. Be careful, it's probably slippery. This way, come on! - Can I, er, speak to you for a minute? - For what? I just wanted to ask you some questions. - You're not police. - No. We had the police here for a full hour. Can you tell me who crossed from Argyle Point yesterday afternoon? Don't worry about who was crossing yesterday. You want to worry about who was crossing today. Hester! Hi. - I'm running away. - I see that. You don't believe me, do you? It's not safe at the house anymore. I don't know what anybody's like. One of us killed mother and now Tina's dead. Yeah, but nobody's going to get anywhere killing you. - You going to stop me? - Oh, not if you're determined to do it. Where were you going to sleep tonight, hmm? - Isn't there any room at your hotel? - I don't know. You'd have to ask 'em. Do you really think I'd be safe at home? Safer than you would be here. Hmm. It's not safe at the house anymore. I don't know what anybody's like. Well, if you're right about the time, it appears you were his alibi. You can't bring him back into their lives. Why bring him back into their minds? Could you see what our family was like two years ago? I don't like what you're implying, Dr. Calgary. Why don't you go back to your hotel room, pack your bags? - Aren't you leaving tomorrow? - Oh, yes. I had good reason. You thought it was Leo and Gwenda. Yes. Yes, I suppose that's what I thought. I was quite satisfied with the conclusion. If Jacko was innocent, you let him hang, not me. Well, whoever it was must have come across on the ferry yesterday. The only one he had any time for was the housekeeper. Why don't you go away before someone else gets hurt? It's gone. The key? Your friend's already waiting for you. You didn't call. What are you doing, Maureen? I saw your chess set. Thought you might fancy a game. Are you any good? Jacko taught me. He used to get angry, 'cause I always won. Are you interested? I'm tired. I'm interested and I'm tired. Seems a pity, seeing as how I'm here and everything. I'll get you a drink, then you can go home. Okay. Pass us my cardy, would you? I heard about Tina. It's a shame. Yeah. I keep thinking I could have done something, but, er... Are you getting anywhere? It looks like you were right, don't it? I don't know. You know Hester? Yeah, she's in the cinema all the time. I saw her tonight coming off the ferry with her suitcase, and I thought, "My God, look, look what I've done. "I've made a 14-year-old girl afraid of her own family." What did you do? Send her back? - Yeah, what else could I do? - You know, it's funny. She was there the night Rachel got killed. - At the ferry? - No, in the cinema. She shouldn't have been. It was an "X". You know what they're like. She's not allowed out on her own at night. I told you. She's in the cinema all the time. She told me she was in the kitchen with Kirsten. That's probably what she tells them. Why don't you sit down? You don't relax much, do you? Sometimes. - Do you spend all your time alone? - No, no, I was married once. Yeah? What happened? My wife had it scientifically proved that I was impossible to live with. I think we'd better get you home. He's dead. Hester. Stay where you are. Hester called me. Is she okay? Would you be if you'd just found him? She's near to hysterical. You'd better come with me. You thought I did it, didn't you? Maybe I still do. You were in town yesterday. Picking up a parcel for Leo. I've already been through all this with the police. And before you ask, Leo was here all afternoon on the telephone. These aren't just alibis, these are facts. Then I don't understand why all the cover-up. What is it makes you so obnoxious? I just don't like the way the Leo Argyles of this world get away with things. Maybe that's just because you don't understand him. I found him in the conservatory. - Philip's dead, isn't he? - Yes. I'm holding you responsible for this. - Did you telephone the police? - No, you'd better do it. - Why have you come here? - Because Hester asked me to. It's gonna be okay. Nobody else is going to get hurt. D'you think you know who did it? I saw her. Police, please. She was there when I got back. There was a light in the conservatory. Mary. Mary, kill Philip? No. I saw her. I saw her do it. No, Philip and Tina were murdered because of something they knew, or something somebody thought they knew. What I can't work out is the connection between Tina's two voices and Jack blackmailing a woman in this house. It's a pity you ever tried to. I mean, the woman can't be Hester. Isn't Gwenda. Mary was with Philip when he saw Jacko. That leaves... You, Kirsten. Are you mad? You were with Hester in the kitchen when Mrs. Argyle was killed. But you weren't there, were you, Hester? You were at an X-rated movie. - It isn't his business. - Why, why? I don't understand. Why, if he was blackmailing you, why kill her? Why not kill him? Jacko, he wanted the money. But you... You killed her. Why? I loved him. He could have killed me, I wouldn't have cared. But he wanted her dead. He planned it. Of course you can. It'll be over so fast, she won't know. I'm afraid. Just do it. Don't think about it. And after that, everything will be wonderful. He wasn't blackmailing me. I'd have done anything for him. I knew it had to be a lie, but he made me believe he loved me. That sounds foolish, doesn't it? Even if it wasn't true, I loved him. It was all a plan, the... ...hitchhiking, the address book, everything. Everything. If you loved him, how could you let him hang? Because she found out he was married and she felt betrayed. What did any of this mean to you? If you hadn't come here, Tina and Philip would still be alive. Quite a sacrifice, just for your peace of mind, isn't it, Dr. Calgary? You still think Jacko's innocence matters, Dr. Calgary? You were right. - Kirsten, is it true? - Yes. I don't believe you. Will you have to leave us? It's cold out here. Go and get me something warm to put on. Go on. sync ? 26.11.2019
