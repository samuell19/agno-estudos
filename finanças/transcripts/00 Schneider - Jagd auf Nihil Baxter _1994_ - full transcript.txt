My name is Commissioner 00 Schneider. The following case deals with an an extraordinary crime. It is murder! I, the Commissioner 00 Schneider, will catch the criminal and put him in prison.

I have cooked something delicious! And opened this bottle of wine. Ahh, this wine tastes a little rhomboid. Ahh, this wine tastes a bit rhomboid. (Yes, give me a sip too!). Its seeding is good. Look how he is leaning. It tastes good. With it: These nutlets! Ohhh, what beautiful nutlets! A noble drop. A bit hard at the base, but it protrudes far into the neck. Well, after all, you have to remember, in a normal household, in normal bottles, you can get on first name basis with such a wine. And now: Murder in the- Murder in the Apollo Circus. Clown Metulski murdered. How can that be? You can't do something like that! Let me have a look. Newspaper. Clown Metulski murdered? April 1st, of all days. Is 00 Schneider coming back?
