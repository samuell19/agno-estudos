I thought there was a problem. [chickens squawking] CATHERINE: Harry. Harry. How long you been there? Not long. Why? Just wondered. Harry. Don't shake your head. To what? I'm happy. Good. Then nothing is wrong. We didn't do anythingto that woman at the farm. I know. Henri told me. Where is he? Don't know. Do you want to bathe? That's all right. You [inaudible]. No, no, I'd look. I would. Nothing wrong. [whistling] [artillery whistling] [explosion] His parents were-- I mean, his father was a veryimportant man in the town. They had a huge house. It seemed like the whole of the family had come from all over Francefor the duration of the war-- and cousins, lots of hands. Michelle knew that I didn't want to go there, but I couldn't stay in the house. Then the mayor came to giveus the news that Michelle had given up his life for France.Ah. It was very grand. You see, Michelle believed innothing, except us, perhaps, so his death was not sad. He was killed by chance, so I was angry. I was not tearful. Yeah, I could still laugh. The household was in mourning for two months. It was dreadful. We all wore black. One day, instead of goingstraight into the dining room, I went in to my room and dressedinto a pretty dress, you know? When I came down, they wereall waiting for me in silence. At the end of the meal,Michelle's father turned to me and he said, we are all one family. Well, the next morning Ileft without any goodbyes. I walked I don't know where, and I started smoking. I know more about you than I do about him. He's a Catholic piano playerwith a boss friend in America. That's all. I can't tell you anything about him-- really, nothing at all. Who are you? CHAPIN: I want to knowwhat you were making today. ROUCHON: Not yet. You can see it in the dark. CHAPIN: What is it? [chuckling] ROUCHON: A surprise. CATHERINE: Ha, ha, ha! Hey! I want a child, our child. You-- will you bring it up? Yes. I'll be the mother, yes. Tell me again. We'll have a child. I want this. I want it. I can tell when you are smiling. Trying to imagine a little girl, aren't I? I can see a girl. Yeah? Hm. What's she look like? She'll have blue dress and red shoes. No, she'll have my bigears, Rouchon's little eyes, and my turned-up nose. She'll look like a pig. Let me. CATHERINE: Where is Henri? CHAPIN: Haven't seen him. They won't need to shoot me and Rouchon. They can't kick us out for another month. Stay here. Henri? Henri? [speaking french] [speaking french] [speaking french] [speaking french] [speaking french] [speaking french] [speaking french] [speaking french] No. Take it. I'll walk you as far as the road. I have to go now. Yeah. I want to say a goodbye. [speaking french] [speaking french] I should be the one to say when we stop. Why are we wrong? You're right. No, you told me. You said over and over-- Yes, but we are right. What we want is done. She has a child. She has it. Why didn't you tell me? You went away. You were saying goodbye. Yes, I'm going, because foryou and me what more can we do? We can celebrate! We can. Yes. Catherine. We need a bottle of wine. We need three bottles, and I can nick it and-- no? No, no, no. We are going to drink to the new child, and you can't steal that one. Well, why not? Wait. We do what we want. - Whatever we want. - Yeah. Good. Our future. Our future. Um, um-- What? My-- I'll do it. To the father. Oh, I've got one. I've got one. To-- there's a piano. Look, over there. I've seen it. Then why are you just sitting here? Come on, give us a tune. - It's not the moment. Yes, it is. Henri Rouchon. I would like to play for you, but-- - But? - OK, that's fine. Well, he's a piano player. There's a piano. I think we should get drunk, very drunk. That's right. A few more glasses of wineand I will think for you, OK? We got enough for another bottle? Yes, just. Can we get it now? Why? CHAPIN: Oh, come on. [speaking french] See, I'll worry about it otherwise. Ah, encore. Play. Eh. Not now. Later. We shouldn't be here. I think we should go. Go where? What? We're celebrating. No, please. We must leave. What for? [speaking french] What is it, the wine? Catherine. [speaking french] Hey, hey, hey, speak in English. Hey, let us go. What's the game? There might not be a child. We can't be sure. I can't be sure. What's she talking about? Calm down. Listen. What if I'm only ill? It's just a feeling? No, come on. We go now. We can talk about it later. No, let's-- What are you doing? Troops here. Sit down. Sit down. [speaking french] Didn't have a child. Is that what she said? Is that what she meant?
