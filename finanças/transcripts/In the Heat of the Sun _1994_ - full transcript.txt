Beijing has changed so fast. In 20 years, it's become a modern city. Almost nothing is as I remembered. These changes have wiped out my memories, and I can no longer distinguish between illusion and reality. My stories always take place in summer. People expose more of themselves in the heat and find it harder to control their desires. At that time, it seemed that summer would last forever. The sun always had time to come out and accompany me. The sunlight was so abundant, so bright, that our eyes were washed in waves of blackness. "In the raging storms of revolution, the morning sun resides in the soldiers' hearts. Chairman Mao! Oh, Chairman Mao! How many words of devotion do we want to say to you! You launched the Great Cultural Revolution, that blazes as bright as a fire. Your glorious thought is like the dew in the sunlight, that nurtures our growth." After the 9th Party Congress in 1969, my father's unit received a new assignment that sent them to Guizhou to support the masses and implement political training. as a model military unit. My most fervent wish was for a war between China and the Soviet Union. Because I was certain that in a new world war the iron fist of the PLA would smash the Soviets and Americans to pieces. and a world famous war hero would be born. That would be me. "Wild goose flying afar, please hurry on your way. Deliver the message to the emancipated serfs miss their savior Chairman Mao." After my father left, I was freer than I had ever been. I had always envied those kids whose parents worked out of town, and today, I was finally one of them. Let's make a bet to see who can toss their bag the highest. What are we betting? Ice pops! Butter flavor! Both! OK, OK, no problem! Me first, me first! Take it easy, take it easy. - We'll start with Big Ant, - OK! And we have to throw our bags as high as a house, OK? OK, OK, go for it Big Ant! 1,2,3! Aiya, aiya! No way! Your turn, Liu Sitian. 1,2,3! No good, no good! Your turn, Yang Gao. 1,2,3! Aiyo, you all suck! OK fine, your turn, Monkey. 1,2,3! Holy shit! You are such a lazy bastard you can't even carry your own bag! Hurry up! - Big Ant! - Big Ant! And so after I graduated from primary school, we were all sent to different high schools. This was a measure the school adopted aimed at breaking up our tittie gangs. But after a few years, our families all moved into the same army compound on the east side of the city, and the gang that had been broken up was once again reunited. - Gooloomoo! Ooba! Ooba! Gooloomoo! Ooba! In the mid-1970s, Beijing didn't have so many cars or luxury hotels, or even that many people on the streets. Kids older than us had all gone to the countryside or into army units, and the town belonged to us. - Time for class. - Attention! Hello, students! Hello, teacher! No laughing. It's just a matter of simple physics. Sit down. Who said you could get up? Such an obstinate delinquent Take your seat! First put the hat up here for me and then take your seat, got it? Got it, teacher Hu. Who's class monitor? Her. She is. Get back here! Who's asking you? The point of asking who the class monitor is is so she can identify herself. After class, take these coals outside and get rid of them. Open your books to page 35. Today we will discuss the Sine-Russian Treaty of Nerchinsk. "Sino" refers to the Qing government. "Russian" to czarist Russia. But Nerchinsk, what's Nerchinsk? It's in the region east of the Baikal Lake. Who did this? Who did this? What's the meaning of this, huh? Who? It wasn't me. Look, my hands are clean. Everyone hold up their hands. Teacher Hu? Speak Never mind Speak UP, don't be afraid. Maybe whoever did it meant to keep the hat from flying off again. So their intentions were good. I'm asking who did it! Oh, that I don't know. Sit down. - Don't be angry, teacher, OK? - Don't be angry, teacher! We won't have class today. I'm telling you, I will get to bottom of this! Teacher Hu! Teacher Hu! Can you toss me my shoe? Sure, do you want me to wipe your ass in the toilet, too? Do you need help to put it on as well? No need for that, just toss it here, OK? Get the hell out! This damn good-for-nothing, ignorant fool! Mr. Mao'. Mr. Jiao'.! Is there a student here that can go get Mr. Jiao of the Workers' Propaganda Team here right now? Hey! Hu, are you so shameless that you don't care about saving face? You won't even do me this small favor? Fine, just you wait! Huh? Your joking! What should I wait for? What can you do to me? Don't come in here and threaten me with your bluster. Fine, fine, you just wait. I don't want it. Come back here! Come here! What, you're going to have someone beat me up? Find my bike and puncture its tires? Huh? No one wants your filthy shoe. Attention! Forward, march! Our leaders can rest assured, we guarantee the completion of our mission. 8-5-1, 8-5-1, this is Yan'an, this is Yan'an. Fire in my direction! Fire in my direction! I was crazy about keys and I even started to make them myself. At first I practiced on all the locks at home, peering into my parents' secrets. Then I began breaking into other people's homes. Every time the bolt released with a click, I was propelled into a realm of sheer bliss. This feeling This feeling could have only been known by the Soviets as they attacked Berlin in WWII. To tell you the truth, I got my talent from my father. During the Korean War he worked out all by himself how to defuse countless American bombs. Many bravely sacrificed themselves doing this, but he came out of it completely unscathed, which is why Mom suspects that all those years he was in Korea were spent hiding out in the mountains. I'd conduct careful inspections only to discover nobody had any money. The machines considered indispensable today were unheard of at that time. Most furniture was provided by the work units. I can testify that expect for a few politically suspect cadres, there was virtually no corruption at that time. In all my exploits I only spotted one old Soviet black and white TV. I actually considered stealing it, but it was too heavy. I vowed that I would only break in, I wouldn't be a thief. When I tired myself out, I'd take a nap on a stranger's bed, imagining what its master might have done there. Don't worry, I would never be caught. No one ever ditched their work back then. And because I never stole anything, I never aroused any suspicion. Of course, I ran into a bit of trouble from time to time. But these occasions didn't diminish my courage, they only increased the thrill. Usually, I only went for padlocks, because they were safe. But on that day, I happened to pick a built-in one. Oh shit! Oh shit! Oh shit! Oh shit! Well, Hu, I got you now, ha ha! This is Yu Beipei, from the foreign ministry compound. This is our mate, Ma Xiaojun. Come on up! That's Liu Yiku, Liu Sitian's stepbrother. Just out of the army, he was handsome and fought dirty. We all looked up to him, - Hi. -Hi. because he always brought girls over for some fun. all day waiting for you, where you been? That girl was called Yu Beipei. That ”pei” is usually pronounced ”bei,” but we always called her Yu Beipei. Actually, even she didn't know which was correct, "pei" or "bei." I didn't know you guys were waiting! Nobody told me Had a date, eh? Fuck your mother! Don't be embarrassed, Monkey! - Say it! Who was it that had a date? - It was me. OK, enough, enough. What thin skin! What's so bad about having a date? Wasn't it a date that brought me here today? Oh yeah, who with? Him. Come sit over here. Just ignore them, they've got dirty minds. Right, she's talking about you, Big Ant. Ignorant fool! Filthy mind! Wasting your life away! Ha, now he's talking shit! C'mon, have a cigarette. Yu Beipei, next time you come over bring that Mi Lan with you and let us meet her. I don't think so Can't you pick up girls on your own? Haven't you said that you're not afraid of anything? I'm serious, we've heard so much about her. She's a legend. Guys have fought over her, friendships have ended, and some have even died. Can't you just give us an introduction? Forget it, she's a proper sort. I never say she wasn't. Anyway, I've asked her before and she said no. The photo I discovered that day threw me into a daze. Her image filled the entire scope of my vision, and the suggestiveness of her gaze was bounded only by my imagination. At that time I had no idea who this Mi Lan everyone talked about was, or her connection with that photo. Gooloomoo! Ooba! See? Wearing no clothes. Wearing no clothes. See it? See it. - No clothes. - You bandits! Stop yelling, and come down! How rascal! Stop yelling! - What the hell are you looking at? - It's boring to see... - Just take a look. Why mess around with the yelling? What you wanna see? Never saw it before? Well, I mean. I have no idea how all three of you went to sleep. There are only two beds in the room. Just sleep on this one, or on that one. Monkey, did you made the visit before and knocked on the door? - No. - Don't deny it, it's you. Never mind. Place your school bags inside, and follow me to the canteen to get meals. Hey, you all are leaving? Someone stays. Talk with me. Okay, who do you want? You, again. Why me again? Let's go. Come on in. So you're a good boy at home? Nah, definitely not. Actually, I'm bad. Just looks like a honest one. Teachers in my school, they all like me very much at first. And started to get tired of me later, they all do. Why about you? What do you think? You... still go to the school? I have job. Already stop taking classes anymore. I'm older than all of you, I'm the eldest girl. But... you always go out and hand around, and don't go home for sleep. Won't your parents guarded you? My old man was furious with me, saying he will reject me as his daughter for several times. Did he hit you? Of course. Had me bundled, then he strikes. He's so cold blooded. Can you blow the smoke rings? No... Ah, I can. Blow out one then. Look at me. What's the matter? I just blew out a very big one two days ago. Actually, you don't need to stay outside all day long, and sleep in boy's house. We are bad boys. It will be so bad if one day something happen. What thing will happen? What the hell thing will happen? If it will, it already did. Won't take place on you guys! Nonsense! Eventually, Yu Beipei didn't blew out a single smoke ring, neither did me. I can't make it until now. Gooloomoo! Ooba! Ooba! - Do you want some? - No, thanks. - Kiss him! - Kiss him again! Chase him! Follow up! Catch him! You OK? Where did you get hit? I'll bite the hell out of you! Let go, let go! Let me go! I'll slap you! Let me go! Now! Right now! I'll fuck you up! - Forget it, Yu Beipei. - Enough, enough. Monkey better stay over there. Beautiful flowers are blossoming, blossoming! Honored guests are coming from faraway, faraway! We sing this joyful song gleefully, gleefully! Friendship's fragrance wafts across the land, across the land! "Welcome! Welcome! We warmly welcome you!" "Welcome! Welcome! We warmly welcome you!" I spent the days wandering around on top of that building, like a cat on a hot tin roof. Restlessly I waited for the girl in the picture to appear. She was like a ghost, leaving neither trace nor shadow as she came and went. Yet I could still sense a vestige of her impression, a trace of her fragrance, that verified her existence. I waited until the stars were high in the sky, but in the end to no avail. Forget it, that's the ambassador. What do you know about ambassadors? It's true, he's got his wife on his arm. She's not on his arm! Didn't we see another guy at the ceremony yesterday? How could you be so ignorant? The ambassador isn't just one guy, there's got to be two or three at least. Maybe this one's from South Korea? South Korea? What the fuck? South Korea is America's. You think we'd let him in? Running dog! Goddamn running dog! Who's a running dog? Hey, hey, hey, which country is she ambassador for? That one there. Go get her to come over here, Yu Beipei. What'd you say to her? Mind your own business. - Are you a dancer? - Yeah. - At the Youth Palace? - Right. Oh, can you tell me your name? I'm Ma Xiaojun. I'm Zhang Xiaomei. "Xiao" as in "dawn." Oh, the "Xiao" in my name means "small." These guys are such a pain. Where do you think you're going? Where do you think you're going? I'm a music lover, I just wanted to see the concert, that's all. So because you're a music lover you impersonate like a foreigner? And the Korean ambassador at that! What what's this? Hey, what are you doing? What's wrong? What do you mean, "what's wrong"? What the hell "What the hell"?! There's nothing going on here. What do you mean nothing? I've been watching you all day. Let's go! What'd I do? I didn't do anything. And you girl there, you're coming in as well. Let's go! - I didn't do anything - Let's go! Your father's name? Ma Wenzhong. Your mother? Zhai Ru. Where do you live? No. 11 Internal Affairs Department Street. What the hell are you looking at? Turn around! Just found this. Dodged a bullet! Don't let this sort of thing slip by next time. That gang's not going anywhere. Carrying weapons on them! Gonna rebel, were they? We'll take 'em to lockup this evening. - Guoqing! You hear that? - Yeah! Uncle, please let me go. What are you crying about? Then Why'd we bring you in? I didn't do anything, really. I was waiting to return some tickets and they hauled me in. Look at your sorry ass! You think half of Beijing is your turf. If it's anyone's turf, it's ours. - Got that? - I got it. Wipe the snot off your nose Now beat it! And don't show your face around here again, punk. Got that? NOW get! This one isn't mine, it's that one. You want it or not? I want it, I want it. If you don't want it, you're welcome to spend the night here. I'll take it! This one's fine! You get over there and fetch my belt. My belt! Go get it! Aren't you a tough guy? Aren't you hard? Lost your nerve, huh? Quit your begging and stop your crying. I don't buy that crap. What was I crying for? That was just to confuse you bastards. If I pick up chicks, what business is it of yours? I'm not after your mother. And I'm telling you right now, I'll be back back here to do it again tomorrow. I'll come alone, and you don't want to try and stop me, bitches. I'm the king of the west side, the east side, and king of your station, too. OK, OK, wipe your nose, and beat it. Are you going or not? If you don't want to leave, you're welcome to spend the night. Who's there? Yang Gao got jumped. Fuck! On his way home, he saw some kids from the Sixth Alley bullying the retarded boy. They were making him eat catshit, and trying to take away that pole he's ridden around for years. Yang Gao went to help him, and they beat him up. His eyes are swollen shut, and they broke the pole in half. Let's go. Hey, what about me? You stay here. I wasn't involved, brother! Out of my way! Yang Gao, was he involved? Let's go. - Hey Monkey, - Huh? When'd you get to be such a thug? What do you mean? What you did with that brick even I was spooked. It was dark. I couldn't see, otherwise I'd have really wasted him. Yo, yo, yo. If I said you were fat, you'd still beg for more. Actually... Actually what? I don't think that kid was involved. Fuck off! Shithead! Why didn't you say so before? It's just that, I couldn't see very well before Monkey bashed him with that brick. In any case, he's part of that gang, and we clobbered him. Go. Get out of here. - What the - Who's there? - It's Yu Beipei - Yu Beipei! Monkey! You go too far! I'm going to beat the hell out of you! Come out here then! - Come on! - Yeah, come on out! You jerks! Look at me! My clothes are soaking! And you've torn the sleeve! What jerks! Yu Beipei, you've got to get out of here. No! No way. I telling you, get out of here. What a drag! You all hiding like that as if I really wanted to see you guys. Hey, Yu Beipei! Those are my clothes! I don't care whose they are! Monkey, this all your fault. He's got a hard-on! He's hard! Hey, he's got a fuckin' hard-on! A fuckin' hard-on! You fuckin' lowlife! I I have to pee. Get the fuck outta here. Hey hey. You talking to me? Yeah, um haven't we met before? Forget it, kid. You're not old enough for this. Wait, don't go! Hey, do you live in that building up there? - Aren't you a high school student? - Yeah. I've seen you before. One day at the entrance of the police station, you were coming out with a policewoman. Hey, can we get to know each other? - Is that really necessary? - Yes! I don't think so. Why not be friends? I can see right away you're a bad seed. What's wrong with getting to know each other? You can be an elder sister to me. Why don't you find your elder sisters someplace else, huh? Hey, if you won't be friends with me, I'll You'll what? Beat me up? Yeah. Really? You really think you can beat me up? Hey kid, come over here. How old are you? Sixteen. Let me have a look. No way you're sixteen, liar. And you? How old are you? Older than you anyway. - You really want me to be your elder sister? - Really. As soon as I saw you, I felt how to put it you're just like my sister. You have a sister? No. What's your name? Ma Xiaojun. Really. It's here on my book bag, Ma Xiaojun. I'm not lying. And yours? Mi Lan. You're Mi Lan - So? - Nothing Um you don't spend much time at home? How do you know? You live in building #5. I've been there before. OK, you should get home before your parents decide to spank you. Go on. Hey, I still have something to tell you. There's something I forgot Uh, have you been to Beihai Park? Really, forget it, what do you mean "been to Beihai Park"? OK, go home, little boy. HEY, um, so you will be my elder sister then? Will you do as I say? I swear. Then hurry home. OK. No more picking up girls on the street! I swear on Chairman Mao, this was my first time. - Bye! - Bye! Hey, I'm really coming to visit you! You really are your father's son! He doesn't come home for years, and I don't see you for days! You treat this place like a hotel and me like a maid! You're something else! Get me some water. In a bowl! Trying to scald me? Ma, I didn't! Damn you piss me off! I didn't, Ma! 'Up- 'up- I'll beat you to death! I'll beat you to death! Don't hit me, mom! I, I'll beat you to death! Beat you to death! Everyday you're away from home! Little jerk! All day I wait for you to appear. You son of a bitch, always running around with those rotten boys. Sooner or later you'll end up in jail, and no one will give a damn. This is a letter from your teacher. Read it. Read it! Other family's children come straight home after school and do their homework. But you? You don't come home 'til after dark. What the hell are you doing 'til then? Huh? Why don't you just be like your father and never come home. Beat it! Get out of here! You're free now, so go visit the police whenever you want. Move in there if you want! Aiya! Do you have any idea that your mom is an educated woman with a proper upbringing. But ever since your dad joined the army, I've been nothing more than a housewife. Is that all I am? Me? I'm so furious I want to burn down the house. The Ma family never raised a decent child, and I could see since you were a kid, you and your jerk of a father were birds of a feather. If you were a chicken, I'd kill you and still wouldn't eat your meat. I hate you! And you hate me, too. When have you ever done anything to make me proud? All you've ever done is disappoint me, and made me hate you. You bastard. I never ever cursed anyone much less hit someone before your father and you came along! You bastards! Get the hell out! In a fit of anger, my mother gave birth to her second son. My mates took her to the army hospital on the back of a bicycle cart because the on-duty driver couldn't get the jeep started. I thought, what sort of preparedness for war is this? If the imperialists launched a surprise attack, we'd be fuckin' annihilated. Whenever my mom beat me, she cursed my dad, but this time her curses really did bring him home. When I got older, I realized that my brother's birth had a lot to do with my breaking into my dad's drawer and puncturing that balloon. That kid from the Sixth Alley I hit was in hospital for a month, but they still didn't respect us enough and they sent somebody to bring word that they wanted to rumble with us. The time was a Monday, and the place was the Marco Polo Bridge. We could each take 100 guys. I couldn't help feeling nervous and regretted trying so hard to be a hero with that brick, because now the other gang said I had to be there. My thoughts turned to Mi Lan. I wanted to go see her right away. because I couldn't say for certain if it would be my final farewell. They want me to go over there. Go over there for what? Just be smart and watch for my signal. Are you Ma Xiaojun? Yeah. You were the one with the brick? Yeah, that was me. Peace! Despite all the painstaking planning beforehand, the rumble never got started. We went to the old Mo', known today as the Moscow Restaurant. "Within the Four Seas all are brothers, and when the world is in turmoil, the supreme virtue is peace. Drink! Cheers! When the pear blossoms are in bloom across the land and a fine mist softly blows over the river Katyusha stands atop the steep riverbank I discovered a rule. A fight will be the most violent when a couple dozen of people are involved, and some will lose their lives. But when hundreds are involved, the fight never gets going. The more people get dragged in, the more likely it is that some on each side will know each other or even try to get the same people to fight for them. That's how it was this time. We'd both gone for the most feared thug in Beijing. He had an awesome reputation, and everyone knew the stories of his bold and brutal ways. This was my first and only encounter with him. Not long after this he was killed by some teenagers who wanted to take his place. All I remember is how soft his hands were, like a girl's. In the end, I got off without a scratch, but something else was driving me crazy. I could never find Mi Lan, and she seemed to be purposefully avoiding me. Mi Lan? Mi Lan? Mi Lan? Who's there? Oh, it's you. Come over here. Why aren't you in school? It's nothing, Our teacher's sick, and we have astudy period in the afternoon, so I snuck out. Have you been by looking for me? No. Why not? Um, we'll have final exams soon, so my classes are really busy and I haven't had anytime to come by. I've been really busy. Really busy. I was just wondering why you disappeared after we only met that one time. Off meeting other "elder sisters" that you got involved with? No, no. Let me ask you, have you met anyone new lately? You kidding me? These clays its like I all I do is kill time hanging around on the street. I haven't done anything else. Not a thing. Definitely not. Hey, can you give me a hand with this? Sure. Can you get me that kettle of water from the hallway? Be careful, don't burn yourself! No problem. Don't worry. I'll help you rinse it. OK. Put in a bit of cold water first, unless you want to burn me. Right, got it. Too hot? No, its fine. The weather's so hot and summer just started. Do you know how to swim? No. Do you? Yeah, I'll show you some day. Great. If I fall in the water, can you come save me? Sure, not a problem. But you're a bit big for me, so I'll need to practice some more first. OK, you can go to Shisha Lake everyday. But what about school? I'll wait for exams to finish first. Put it over there. Yeah, we can go there together. OK, stand there and don't move. So what are you studying now? Huh? Studying? I'm not sure either Oh yeah, we're learning how to make wine, and, uh, violins, and sesame paste, stuff like that. Where do you study such a mess of stuff? From the workers and peasants! We worked for a month in the wine factory, and got into a fight with some kids there. They brought 200 guys, but we still beat them back, and now we always carry cleavers in our book bags. One day this older kid was begging for mercy, but we cut him with our cleavers a few times anyway. Really? So what do they test you on? Making wine or fighting? Sit down. Where? Anyway, we were only there one month. The rest of the time we still had to go to class. But usually I just find some books to read on my own. What sort of books do you read? How Steel Is Tempered, The Gadfly, Song of Youth, Bitter Blossoms, that sort of thing. Do you like the character Dunya? Um, I like Pavel, but I like Dunya, too. Its too bad how she changed and became bourgeois. - You finished all those books? - No. Why not? They're just old books without beginning or end. Hey, what about Two Hundred Songs? You read that? Of course! It's called Two Hundred Folk Songs from Abroad. It's a songbook. I can't read music, so I just read the lyrics. Why don't you teach me to sing them sometime? Sure, no problem. Where do you work? Far away. Why don't you have to go back? I do, I'm always there, and usually stay there. Oh, so that's why you're never home. So you have come to see me? No. - Liar! - I haven't! My grandma told me there's this kid always coming by that runs away as soon as she opens the door. It wasn't me! That really wasn't me. Really. OK then. Anyway, I'm on sick leave, so come by when you have time. - What's wrong with you? - Mind your own business. Oh, um, OK. Don't you have a photo of you in a bathing suit? Nonsense! When have I ever worn a bathing suit? It was hanging right there. I'm sure of it. There was a photo, but I wasn't in a bathing suit. Impossible! Show it to me. A friend took it. I'm positive you were in a bathing suit. Such a stubborn kid! Then look. I'm sure it's here. Is it there? It was just like this one, but with a bathing suit. It's not this one Was it hanging there? Tell me, am I wearing a bathing suit? No, you're not. That's not it. It was hanging there. It was in color OK, OK, OK. Why don't you take a photo of me sometime? Um, OK. Can you let me have this one? No. Come on, let me have it. No. What do you want with my photo anyway? If you really won't give it to me I'll have to steal it. You'd dare! Slop! Aiya! Aiya! Aiya! You mad? Don't be unhappy, really. It's not nice to grab girls' photos. Come over here. I've got something for you. Come here. Here. It's got three colors. For a time I saw her practically every day. To make myself look good, I'd take credit for things other people had done, exaggerating and embellishing my stories with abandon. The worst part was that my daring escapades matched neither my actual age or experience. Yet she always praised me and never looked shocked at anything I said. I told her I'd learned how to make keys and could pick any kind of lock. I even told her that I'd broken into her home, played with her spyglass, and seen her photo. Ah she said was, ”Really?” Sometimes while I was talking she'd fall asleep, and I'd try hard not to stare uncontrollably at her exposed body, but my thoughts ran wild. Wait a moment It seems my memory is playing tricks on me and I've confused reality and dreams. Maybe she never fell asleep in front of me at all. Maybe she never stared at me like that at all. Then how is her intensely penetrating gaze and soundly sleeping figure so deeply etched into my brain? I finally took my last exam and would have the summer holiday in two days. You shopped for groceries like a little housewife? Call me a little housewife if you want, but if I didn't buy groceries what would we eat? We go on vacation day after tomorrow. How great to be a student, and have two holidays every year. But if I didn't have to go to school, I could come here to see you every day. Why don't you come on up? No, I have to go. I've been here waiting for you all afternoon. Really? Why were you waiting for me? When can you come out to hang outwith us? I won't. I have no desire to meet your gang of rotten boys. You haven't met them, so how do you know they're bad? You should come meet them, they're really a lot of fun. Some other time. That's no good we won't know how to get in touch then. Let's set a day now. Alright. What day's good for you? Monday. There's fewer adults around on Mondays. OK. This is a reconnaissance map I drew for you. Just follow the arrow and you'll find me. I'll wait tor you at the gate of the compound. OK. Over here! Bum me a cigarette, OK? Why you always bumming people's shit? You've never buy your own. So what? I'll give you a pack later, OK? - Nope. - Just give me one! Get outta here. Smoking at the gate, just like an addict. Let me explain. If you let Mi Lan see you smoking, it will give her a bad impression of us, and she'll say, what kind of guys does this Monkey hang outwith? Right, Monkey? Is she coming or not? Don't try and trick us now. Hey Monkey! Are you trying to trick us? You sure you know Mi Lan? Why don't you guys go ahead of me instead of staying here clicking around? OK, we'll wait for you behind the compound. Let's go. Gooloomoo! Ooba! Gooloomoo! Ooba! Ooba! Hey Monkey, can I stay here with you? OK, if you don't mess around. What does Mi Lan look like? Is she hot? Why don't you just go with the others? No, if you tell me, I can help you keep an eye out for her. No thanks. Hey'? Hey'? - Is that her? - Yes. Why'd you come from that direction? Sorry, I got lost. All because of your reconnaissance map. A map? Let's go this way. They're waiting at the pavilion up there. I've seen you before. Don't you work at the same farm as Yu Beipei? Yes, that's right. We're good friends with Yu Beipei. Really? She knows a lot of people. This is the guy I told you about, Liu Yiku. This is his little brother, Liu Sitian. This is Big Ant, who you just met. Where's Yang Gao? Buying ice-pops. There's one more. They're all my pals. Your place here is great. Give me a hand, Big Ant. That's Yang Gao now. What took you so long getting back here? - Hi. - This is Mi Lan. -Hi. Thanks. I'm dying of thirst. Why'd you come this way? It's pretty dicey. Um, well, it's a short cut. Do you know which film's on tonight? Which one? Lenin in 1918. Really? Great! Vastly! Quick, take this. "Tell Kerensky Bukharin and Trotsky are traitors. They want to assassinate Lenin." "Don't worry. Bastard, die already!" Hey, that girl really looks an old trooper. Her ass is round from so much fucking. I'll fuck you up! Do you think she's good looking? You bet. Have you done her yet? You think I can put the moves on her? How about getting one tor your brother, too? One for your brother? Get off! Fuck! Hey, stop! If only you could play the violin, my dad's cultural troupe needs a violinist. If you can play the pipa can't you also play the violin? They're two different things. One is plucked and the other is bowed. You have to use a bow. Mi Lan! Whatever you do, don't join his father's troupe. His father would violate you first thing. Monkey, sure you're not thinking of your own father? Isn't he the one who got demoted for bad behavior? That's your dad! Yours! I heard he has two wives, one back in the countryside, and a new one. Why do you think one's called Sitian ("thinking sweetness") and the other is called Yiku ("recalling bitterness") Monkey's badmouthing your father. Should we teach him a lesson? Forget it let's give him a little face today. Enough, already, there's no need for such panic. You really think I'm going to join the troupe right this minute? So do you really want to join the army? I do. And do what, try out for "The Soldiers' Friends" troupe? I'm aiming for a political position. Mi Lan, if you play the plpa, you can play guitar, can't you? More or less. We've got a qin at home. I'll go get it for you. What the tuck are you talking about? I want to fly! I want to fly high in the sky, through the clouds, all way to the Kremlin! I'll fly to Leningrad! - So fly! - Yeah, fly! What you sitting down for? Fly! I'll ascend to the heights and gaze into the distance! Monkey seems a bit different today, he's talking all poetically. Really? What the hell are you doing? Scaring everybody like that. Didn't he say he wanted to ascend the heights? But this isn't that high. Is there anyplace higher than this around here? Yes, that smokestack. There, that's pretty high! Yang Gao, don't joke around. How about you go up first and we'll watch. I'm not the one who said I wanted to ascend the heights. Has anyone ever climbed to the top? I have. Really! You're really something! Why don't you show us? Forget it. Come on, let Mi Lan see you do it! We'll give you two packs of Peony cigarettes. Get outta here. Just two? Plus two packs of Phoenix on the Wind. Right, he got four packs last time he went up there. But I already did it. A hero doesn't bring up past glories. make some new contributions! Why don't you make some new contributions? Hey, how about this four packs of filter tips, plus two packs of Cathays? I'll do it! Hey! Ma Xiaojun! Ma Xiaojun! He's really going to do it! No way. He doesn't know how to get up there. There's rolls of barbed wire blocking the ladder. He can't up there. Can he get up there, Ant? No way, he's just trying to scare us. Really, Mi Lan, he'll be back in no time. Vastly! There! There he is! Vastly! Is that really Monkey? How the fuck did he get up there? Vastly! Get down! How the fuck did you get up there? Hurry up and come down, Monkey! Vastly! - Get down! - Don't fuck around, Monkey! - Get down! - Come on, Monkey! - Get down! - Come down! Incoming! Oh fuck! Monkey, hurry up and get down! - Don't throw it Monkey! Get down! Come on! You're crazy! "We're all sharpshooters each of our bullets takes down an enemy..." - Monkey! - Monkey, where are you? Don't yell at him! He'll get scared! Aiyo! Smoke! Ma Xiaojun! Where are you? Go buy my cigarettes! Go buy my cigarettes! Go buy my cigarettes! Go buy my cigarettes! Mi Lan, don't leave yet, stay for the film tonight. Everyone said I was charmed. No one talked about supernatural powers at that time, otherwise I would have been famous. Later I found out it was the chimneys upward draft and years of accumulated ashes that saved my life. You scared us to death. And you're not even hurt! Almost supernatural. What's with you, dummy? You haven't said a word. And you still get mad! If you don't want to talk to me, I can leave. Who's getting mad? Don't you like talking with strange boys? You tell me. I don't know. And now you get jealous! Fine, you really think I'm that kind of girl? Who's jealous? What were you talking about with Liu Yiku, anyway? Nothing much, I told him I wanted to join the army and he said he'd help. Why didn't I know you wanted to join the army? You never told me you wanted to join the army. You meet him once and tell him everything. You move pretty fast What was I supposed to do? Just sit there? You asked me to go there, and then you just ignore me, and play some heroes, some Vastly, from Lenin in October. It's Lenin in 1918. Fine, Lenin in 1918. That's still no excuse to give me the cold shoulder. Huh, Dad? Um, uh this. This is my dad. This is Hello, uncle. Our teacher. Oh, how do you do? Well I should be going. Goodbye, Ma Xiaojun. - Goodbye, Uncle. - Goodbye. Um, little comrade, your name is what again? I'm Mi Lan. Is there anything else, sir? Uh, no, that'll be all. Then I'll be going. OK. - Good bye. - Goodbye. Get me my overcoat. What do you want with that on such a hot day? - I said get my overcoat. - OK. Here it is, dad. - Sit there. - OK. So what work unit does this teacher of yours work in? That teacher works at our school. New, is she? Right, she's new. Where's she from? She's from somewhere on the west side. No, wait, it's Xidan. Right, it is Xidan. What subject does she teach? Uh, she teaches a bit of everything. You just saw her making home visits, right? She's probably is seeing other students now. Teacher my ass! What teacher calls me "uncle"? You'd lie to your old man like that? You've got nerve! Take off that uniform! Lying like that! I saw through you right away. You're a bad student at school, disobedient at home, and now you've bring some girlfriend home with you? What girlfriend? She just came in to wash her face. Wash her face? Wash what face? You think I couldn't see her blushing? Don't you forget, I'm your father. I've eaten more salt than you've eaten rice! If she's not your girlfriend, what is she? This is called puppy love! And it's not allowed! So where's she from? Oh, forget it. I don't have time for this. When you mom gets back from your grandma's, tell her I've been sent to Inner Mongolia for field training. It's an urgent mission. When will you be back? In a month. What's the matter? Think you can run wild again, right? Try it! Political Commissar Ma! Time to go! Coming! This is this month's salary. Give it to your mother. Don't upset her. I'll say that once more. These two yuan are for you. Don't waste them. Don't go bringing girls back here, and never lie to me again. All right, I'm off. Yang Gao! Yang Gao! Yang Gao! Comrades, everybody, quiet down! There's been a technical problem. It's been taken care of now, so we'll move on to the second film, Lenin in 1918. Liu Yiku! Liu Sitian! "Vastly! Vastly! Quick, go save Lenin!" Yang Gao! Yang Gao! Careful, it's poison! "Careful, it's poison!" Where the hell were you? Where were you? I've been looking all over for you. I've been looking for you, too. Let's go. Where have you been? Looking for you. Where are the others? Comrades! Some children have snuck into the theater. We apologize for temporarily stopping the film. Where are the kids? Oh, they're everywhere. Why don't I see any? All children, stand up! Stand up, over there! Stand up! How did this happen? Who's responsible for watching the door? Not a single one of these children entered through the door. This film is under criticism, and is extremely poisonous! If children watch it, they could commit crimes. They could commit major crimes! That's it for the film. Don't! For now, whoever kids these are, they should come take them away now. "Moonlight so fine enraptures my heart. So many enchanting evenings By my sweetheart's side, I gaze at her silently, without a sound. A night so fine enraptures my heart. So many enchanted evenings The long night quickly recedes in the light of a dream. With all my heart, sweet maiden, I wish you well, but still hope that from this day on neither of us will forget this evening on the outskirts of Moscow." You sleeping? No. Why haven't you said anything? You haven't said anything either. Why don't you try to sleep a bit? I'd fall off. Hold on to my waist. Is that OK? It's fine. That was the most perfect day of my life. The caresses of the morning breeze raised goosebumps on my skin, and my whole body tingled. I still remember the particularly aromatic smell of dead grass burning. But who'd be burning dead grass at the height of summer? Whatever the truth is, in my memory, everything that happened that summer is accompanied by the smell of burning grass. Here it is, Xiaojun. Look, from here on, - it's all our farm. - Really? Thanks for taking me all this way. It's nothing. I can take you further if you like. No need, I can cut through here. Go home and get some sleep. - Bye! - Bye! Who are you? Don't jump in here. Comrade Monkey, I was looking for you. Cat got your tongue? The situation is so urgent. How can you sleep here? - It's you. - It's me. Get up! - Roger. - Lie down! Don't move! Enemies! - Where? - Look there! Oh, you're Milan? Yes, call me comrade Milan. Where is my bike, comrade Milan? I've moved it to a safe place, right there. Stop! Comrades. Comrades. We're all clueless. Just be careful. Hold your fire and slip into the village. - Yes! - Open a way! Why they called themselves comrade? It was to trick the people. No, they are riding my bike! No nonsense, comrade Monkey. You bike is still hanging on the tree. That's our special bike mine. Here, hold this rope. Pull it down, as the fighting began. Your testing moment had come, do you hear me? Please rest assured, I guarantee to fulfill the mission . Taste the people's bullets, you invaders! What the hell, why there's no response? Ma Xiaojun! Now! Dunya, are you refusing to work? Just ignore him and follow me. I'm so sad, Dunya. That you've involved with people like Liu Yiku. Take me with you! Take me with you! It's the guerrilla! Milan. What did I said to you before leaving? Hurry up, Milan. What's wrong, Ma Xiaojun? You're crying in the sleep. - I dreamed you were dead, Milan. - Hahaha. It's good to see you alive. Gosh, that chased me urgently bad. You were really missing me. Sorry, I feel an extreme stomachache. I must go for a place. Come and see! Come on! Come and see! Don't follow me. - Come on! Come and see! - How can you be so rascal! Come and see! Haha! Come on! Come and see! Haha! Come and see! - Come on! Hahaha! - I'm begging you. - How can you be so rascal! - Come and see! - Kid, get up! - How can you be so rascal! Are you okay? I can't be awake from this dream. Get up, kid. Are you sick? Hey, get up! Kid, are you sick? Where's Milan? Kid, don't mess around your dream with reality. It's always been me and my grandson. There's no Milan here. From that day on I don't have dreams any more. I don't know why, even the doctor has no idea. I saw Milan again in my dreams last night. - Dad! - Huh? Grandfather died. Over the swells of waves in the East China Sea. A red sun rises! In the phrasing of those days, my grandfather "committedsuicide to escape punishment." He was condemned with four labels, "big landlord," "big capitalist," "KMT member," and "counterrevolutionary" After the Cultural Revolution started, his home was continuously ransacked by people looking for gold and incriminating evidence. After enduring such physical and mental torture, he died in anger. It wasn't until later that I found out my parent's marriage was not approved by the authorities because they belonged to different classes. But they refused to heed the warnings and went ahead with it anyway. Consequently, my dad's career prospects were ruined and my mom also lost her teaching job. She became an army housewife and her temper got worse and worse. Before I started school, I lived with my grandparents. I couldn't understand how he could have been an enemy of the proletariat. After my grandfather's death, my mom became withdrawn, and I gave up trying to mend my ways. After I got back from Tangshan, the first thing I did was to look for Mi Lan. Mi Lan? Who's there? Who's there? Don't run! Don't cry. Gooloomoo Ooba Ma Xiaojun! Aiyo, it's Monkey! Where have you been? Haven't seen you for days. We missed you. Uh, yeah, I really missed you guys, too. - Something came up at my grandparents. - Really? And I went back to Tangshan with my folks. I've been looking for you. I've got a great idea. What's that? You've got a great idea? When did you get so full of yourself? You just noticed? How is it that I've never saw this before? How come I didn't know you're so full of yourself before? I was hiding it deep inside. What else are you hiding? You really want to know right now? Yes, right now. Well, I'll tell you then Go on. You want to know that bad, do you? You're so full of it Oh, Ma Xiaojun! Come over tonight! Do you think my body is awkward? I'm too fat, right? - You're pretty damn chunky. - What? I said you're pretty and chunky, not pretty damn chunky. Hmph! Can't get ivory from the mouth of a dog! Can't get ivory from a person's mouth, either. Can you hawk up some ivory from your mouth? Mi Lan! He wants you to watch him dive. Oh really? I don't want to watch. Oh, right, Ma Xiaojun. What a jerk! Actually, it's just my hips that are a bit thick. It's not just your hips. Look at those legs, that tummy, and look at this here! Here, here! Export quality! I am a bit fat. Tell me, do you think I should be wearing a bathing suit? Does it expose too much of me? It's nothing I can't see when you're not wearing one. What? What can you see? Never mind, you'd be angry. Tell me! I won't be angry. It's like you've just had a baby. Ma Xiaojun! I'm not speaking with you. Mi Lan, come on in! Nope, I'm not coming in. You come up here. How about ten meters high? I can't dive. Mi Lan, come here and I'll teach you. Come on! Ma Xiaojun! You bastard. Fuck off! Ignore him. - You Liu Yiku? - That's right. You brought Mi Lan here? That's right. Hey, hey, brothers. Um, perhaps you guys haven't met before. Liu, let me introduce you. This is Brother Tiger, whose fame precedes him. That's all, I'm just asking. It that's the case, we'll be going. OK. We'll meet again, friend. Let's go. Mi Lan, that Brother Tiger guy, who is he anyway? You really want to know? Forget about it. Every time I asked about that Brother Tiger guy, she told to forget about it. Later I heard they were once very close, and that he lost his eye on her account. From that day on, Liu Yiku openly took Mi Lan as his girl. August 23rd was Romanian Liberation Day, and my and Liu Yiku's birthday. We were born in the same month, on the same day, but different years. That night, we went to the Moscow Restaurant. Oh, great! Look who's here! - Hello, boys! - Hello! Seeing everyone together here is truly heartwarming. Ha! Truly heartwarming! Look what I've brought the birthday boys. Are your hands clean? Look! OK. Wow! A poetry book! You think he'll look sharp at the ice rink wearing that this winter? Very sharp! Wrong! Will the chicks all flock to him without him even trying? That's no good, it's too dangerous. If they flock to him the ice won't be able to hold up, You'd better let me wear it for you, brother. Thanks. Look at you, you're just going to say "thanks" and that's it? Then what else should I do? Think about it. Open yours, Ma Xiaojun. Wow, she really takes care of you! Keep your fuckin' mitts off of it! Try it on. The waist is definitely right. It it tits in the waist, isn't that enough? Not necessarily try it on, Monkey. - Try it on, Monkey! - Try it on! Fuck! Lowlifes. Ignore them. Just keep practicing your swimming. I'm still counting on you to save me. Well, then I guess there's no need to thank you if it's only so I can save you, after all. So count Liu Yiku's deeply felt thanks from both of us. You really have no heart! Fine, if that's what you think. Comrade, can you hurry up with our food? We've all arrived now. No hurry, just bring us some water first. Ar'! Can't that waitress speak? Let's have some fun first. What can we play? Think! You're always got lots of ideas! We could play "Find the Hankie" and use Ma Xiaojun's red undies. That's called "Find the Undies." OK, OK, OK. I've got a game. You're not allowed to ruin your birthday present. Relax, we don't need it. Who's got a coin? How do you Play? - Is one enough? - Are we gambling? Today we will publicly test your honesty and courage, and whether you are a virgin! OK, let's do it! I put the coin here, and ask you some questions. You have to answer truthfully and succinctly, after pulling the coin out from my hand here. - All right. - OK. - No dirty tricks, all right? - OK. First question. How old are you? No good, can't tell you. Older than you guys anyway. Fine, I'll let you pass on that one. - But when's your birthday? - I was born on Jan... Hey, pull out the coin first. Right. Big Ant remembers how to play. Okay, what's the date? January 1st, same as the year itself. That's much cooler than Romanian Liberation Day. Second question. Give me back the coin. How old were you when you had your first boyfriend? Hmm 16. That's young! Third question. On your first date with your boyfriend, what did he say to you? He said what? - It's too tight it won't come out. - What? It's too tight, I can't pull it out! Damn you, Monkey, you are a beast! You are so rotten! I never saw it coming! What are you hitting my head for? I'm not your son. I was dumb to begin with, but it gets worse with every hit. - What's wrong, Ma Xiaojun? - Don't touch me! Hey, Mao Xiaojun - What's going on? - Don't touch me! Ma Xiaojun, you're angry. I'm not angry. Why would I be angry? So why are you so upset? Who's upset? Not me. How? What did I do to provoke you like this? Nothing, you've been great. Ma Xiaojun, everyone was having a good time. You can tease others just fine, but you freak out as soon as someone touches you. I use my wit, not my hands. I ... I don't care if you tease me. You're not being very nice. I'm not a nice person. I mean, you're not like you were before with me. I'm exactly the same to you as I was before! Well, it wasn't like this before. You weren't like this before! Are you sick of me? So what if I were? Or what if I'm not? If you're not, we can celebrate your birthday. But if you are, I can go. Hey! Comrade waitress! Can't you bring us our food? We're so hungry we're getting grumpy. So go ahead then. Can I ask why? No reason. Ma Xiaojun, chill out. Yeah, forget it, Monkey. No! Let her leave! Aiyo, Monkey, just drop it, our food's almost here, When a guy gets hungry, he can get pissed off, look at me, even I'm in a bit annoyed. Forget it, OK? You still haven't left? Didn't you say you'd go? Get the fuck out! I guess I'll go then. Just sit down. Ma Xiaojun, let her stay, OK? Give me some face. I'm not giving anybody any face today. I'll take on anybody who takes her side. Ma Xiaojun, you don't get face if you don't give any. I don't have the patience to deal with you. Fuck your mother! I'll brawl with you! Shut your fucking mouth! I'll slice you up! Don't believe a word of this. We never done anything so courageous or heroic. I keep promising to tell the story truthfully, but no matter how strong my wish to tell the truth, things just keep interfering. We tragically discovered that there's just no way to return to the original truth. My memory makes my emotions seem superficial and even plays with me, betraying me and throwing my mind into such disarray I can't tell true from false. Now I suspect that that first meeting with Mi Lan was fabricated, and actually I never even saw her on the street that time. That other afternoon Liu Yiku told Big Ant and I to wait for Mi Lan at the gate, that was the first time we met. That explains why Big Ant and I went off to play Vastly and didn't talk much to her, because I didn't even know her very well. I was never close with Mi Lan at all. My god... Was Mi Lan the girl in the photograph? And why did Yu Beipei suddenly disappear? Maybe maybe she and Mi Lan were the same person? I simply don't dare think about it too much. I started telling this story in all sincerity, but despite my mighty and resolute efforts, it turned into a lie anyway. But is this a reason to abandon it altogether? No! Absolutely not. How could you tolerate me doing that? Now I understand only too well the predicament of the perpetual liar that tries to become an honest guy. It's simply impossible. Listen hey, listen! Sometimes a particular sound or smell can take you back into the actual past. My head is now as lucid as a bright moon. So, H! continue with my story, never mind whether it's the truth or not. I remember that on that day of my birthday nothing bad happened at all. Liu Yiku and I had a great time taking turns toasting Mi Lan. Oh yeah, Yu Beipei was there, too. I almost forgot. There were stacks of gifts, and Mi Lan was particularly affectionate towards me, fixing me again and again with that piercing gaze of hers. In the end, we all got drunk. For several times, she had undressed me. And I had undressed her, too. But after that, I didn't know what to do. - Do you believe that? - I do. Yes, I do. I can't advise you about it. We both are just like yesterday. No one can advise nobody. Do you think that I am very indecent and lascivious? I don't think so. But I do think you were close to the edge. Fortunately you didn't impregnate her. You're right. I just felt that she was bolder than me! Mi Lan! Mi Lan! Mi Lan! Mi Lan! Mi Lan! Mi Lan? Ma Xiaojun? What is it? What's wrong? Tell me, what's wrong with you? I like you! What? What did you just say? My bike fell in the ditch. When the rain had passed and the skies cleared, it seemed that nothing had happened. I tried to remind her of it, but she didn't have any reaction. She still treated me with affection and courtesy. Can it be that what happened that rainy night wasn't real? But it still hurts where I injured myself in that fall. Ma Xiaojun? What are you doing? Let me go! Let me go right now! You... Is this how you get your kicks? Hell yes! Mi Lan and I were completely through. Soon, I was shunned by everyone else. In immense suffering, I passed the days one by one. Two months later, Mi Lan stopped hanging out with us. At the end of the year, Liu Yiku went back into the army, and found a proper girlfriend. Later, we were all separated into different army units. I heard that in the border war with Vietnam, Liu Yiku suffered from shell shock. After a while, everyone lost touch completely. Hey, hey, look! Isn't that ...? - Who's that? - Ooba! Ooba! What do you mean "Ooba"? It's "Gooloomoo!" Oh, right! Gooloomoo! - Gooloomoo! - Gooloomoo! Hey! Gooloomoo! - Gooloomoo! - Gooloomoo! Idiots!
