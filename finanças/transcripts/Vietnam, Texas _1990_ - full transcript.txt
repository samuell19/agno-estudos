Look, I gotta get back to work. -Same time next week? -Yeah. This is the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world. Happy are those who are called to His supper.

And Monsignor's head about twists off when he sees me watching him, and he turns to me and he says, "Even a man on a diet has got a right to look at the menu." [PEOPLE LAUGHING] Notre-Dame will take 'em by 10... But I always think of Bing Crosby singing... -No. Please, Father, no singing, no singing. -No? No. Have you ever heard Bing Crosby singing? Oh, singing in one of his sermons. -Gentlemen, gentlemen. -[ALL CHEERING] You all have done a great job this year. Your individual work in the parishes have honored the Catholic Church and served God well. -Ah! -[ALL CHEERING] God bless you all. Now there's a priest here who is a special honor for all of us. Especially in his work with children. He's faced the worst kind of intercity strife and beaten it back. -Sometimes in the boxing ring, I might add. -Yeah. That he's been named our new monsignor, comes as a surprise to no one. Gentlemen, I give you Monsignor Thomas Michael McCain.

We had so much... You're a father? -Are you? -Okay, let's go back to playing. [ALL SCREAMING] THOMAS: I'm going to make a confession. Before I was a priest, I was a soldier in Vietnam. While I was there, I fell in love with a girl I left behind. I mean, I believe she was carrying my child when I left her. We've all lived a life before we were priests, if you had indeed fathered a child I'm... I'm sure the Church will help you financially and otherwise. I... I don't think that the Church should help me, um, because I'm not so sure I'm going to continue as a priest. Oh, God! [SOBS] -[CLEARS THROAT] -You know where the child, if indeed there's a child, might be? Yeah. I, um... I think I know where I can find her out, you know. [SNIFFLES] Do you want to see her? I have got to see her and... [SIGHS] Amen. Thanks, Father. DRIVER: You're going to start a church here, Father? No, not exactly. Sorry, this is as far as I go. You know, if it's the tip, I, uh... Oh, no, just... Just give me the seven bucks on the meter. I don't go in there. Here you go. [SIGHS] Ever been to the real Saigon, Father? Yes, as a matter of fact, I have. This place's gonna bring back a lot of memories for you. WOMAN: Oh, yes. [MOANING] [SLAMS DOOR] Son of a bitch. Hey, girl, I'll be back later. [GLASS SHATTERING] [WHISPERS] Come on! Come on!

[DOOR SLAMS] Well, you son of a bitch, I'll... Priest? I see not much has changed. How are you hitting them? [SIGHS] This... This is a hell of a shock. Don't you think I'm the type? [SIGHS] I heard about this, but knowing you, I didn't believe it. [METAL CLANKING] What's all the noise about? Oh, your brothers were here. They came for their beer cooler. Oh, yeah? You didn't tell them I was here, did you? No, you'll always be my little secret. Uh... This is a friend of mine, Tom McCain. [CHUCKLES] You're a priest. [CHUCKLES] You guessed right off, huh? Come here to save Max's soul? Oh, you know, the Lord works in strange ways. I'm Catholic. -Really? -Mmm. Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. Yeah. You bet your ass you have, you little... Nice little girl you have there, Max. Yeah. So... So... I... I don't know what to say. So I guess this is for real, huh? Well, it ain't Halloween, pal. Makes you a little nervous, doesn't it? Nervous? Nah! A little fucking uncomfortable. Excuse the language. You're excused. Bless you, my son. "My son?" Yeah, you son of a bitch, you look great! You look like shit. I had early stages of sclerosis, uh... Bar's been a bust ever since my old man died and I shut it down every day at happy hour in his memory. So, you know what, McCain, it's been a lot of years and nobody knows you're alive or dead, and, uh, suddenly you show. What's the deal, you still pissed off? No, no. I, uh... I don't think much about the past. Ah. Yeah, right. Me neither. I don't give a shit either. Hmm. Hey, listen. I'd like to know where is Mailan is. -Not here, pal. -[MUSIC PLAYING] What? Hey! What are you doin'? Where you've been? Hey, dude! I'm here now. Do want to hear my new opening? The shit you got to put up with when you run your own business. Hey! Hey!

You must be Oriental. -Hey, shut up! -[LAUGHING] Clean the place up, you fish-head. You Americans, you can never say what you mean. Like, this thing, "I'm taking my dog for a walk." Come on! You're not taking your dog for a walk. You're taking your dog for a shit! -Jesus. -What's this guy all about? He's trying to get an audition for the Johnny-fucking-Carson Show. Breakfast, Father? No, thanks, uh... Look, can we just cut all this bullshit and get to it? Cut the what? -Where is she? -Who? Want me to take the collar off and just beat the shit out of you right here and now? -Just like old times, huh? -Just like old times. So... -Yeah. She wasn't here that long ago. -How long? Six months, maybe. That's after four years she spent in a Thai refugee camp. -What? -Yeah. Her too. She got a letter to me through the VA. I sent her some money and got them over. -Them? -For her and the kid. Come on, you knew about the kid. No. No. I didn't. So, um, what's the child's name? Lan. It was really sad. That little rug rat, she used to ask about you all the time. But her mom and I, we figured it was best to keep her in the dark. -You know. -Her mom and you? You married her? Wasn't exactly till death do us part, if you know what I mean. Yeah. Why did she leave you? I'm a shitty housekeeper. She's a Viet, man. Viet all the way. What's that supposed to mean? That is supposed to mean that she wanted to be with her own people. She married a guy named Wong. He can provide for her. He runs a place called the House of Flowers. You know this guy? Well enough to stay away from him. New mafia. You got an address or something? Forget it. Just forget it. I'm not going to forget it. Don't you tell me to forget it! If I've got a kid, I got the right to know who it is. Look. I don't know what the hell you think you're doing here. Priest or no priest, you blew the chick off, okay? You ain't welcome here. Me? I'm just running this place for the shit-faced jarheads who can't forget the glory days. So stay drunk for a week on the house, all right? But don't get involved with these people. Especially the women. [JOVIAL MUSIC PLAYING] MAN: Boom! Hey! Boom! Hey! Hey, look at it this way. This is your American foreign policy, you fuck 'em then you leave 'em. You got a real good outlook on life, Max, a real good outlook. I want you to take me to see her. Big-time Texas lawyer. Late as usual. [ANNOUNCING IN VIETNAMESE] I'll be at breakfast. I love the suit. [ALL SPEAKING VIETNAMESE] Good morning, Father. I hope you slept well last night. [ALL SPEAKING VIETNAMESE] [ALL GREETING IN VIETNAMESE] -You're late. -Good morning to you, too. You know, we have a little problem with our new business operation. It can wait till office. -Hi! -Morning. You look so pretty today. You ought to put her in commercials. Have something to eat. Well, I ate downtown, but I'll have a cup of coffee. You, uh, you know of course that your fishermen friends are not cooperating. Uncle Wong! -Hi. -Hi. Hi. I love you Uncle Wong. Do you like children? Not to eat. You know, Mr. Wong, a lot of work went into this deal. Our problem with the community is being handled. Oh. Special for you. Koi, my favorite. -From the pond? -Correct. [SIGHS] MAN: Yellowjacket. [SIGHS] Please, Minh, we won't do this anymore. You're well paid for your cooperation. We don't want your money. We're honest businessmen. Don't argue with them. Please. We're fishermen, not criminals. Please leave us alone. You'll do whatever we tell you. Just be glad you're not one of his fish. No more. We shut down market. We would rather starve than do this business of yours. Fine. Have it your way. May I have a word with you? [SOBBING] Away! Put it in the trunk. Seems we are not welcome here anymore. Joey. [WHISTLES] [PEOPLE SCREAMING] This is a new business for us, too, Papa -san. But teach your friends the value of cooperation or you'll wish you never came to Little Saigon. I do business with these people! Do you have any idea what this is gonna cost me? Jeez! [HONKING] I see your driving habits haven't changed much. Yeah, I'm telling you, you don't know what you're getting into down here, okay? Priest or no priest, damn it, man! You don't understand about these people. So what do you suggest I do? Just walk away and forget about her? Yeah! Yeah, you should, because they're prejudiced, you know. They don't like this half-breed shit. It's a cultural thing! Jesus! [POLICE SIREN WAILING] Hey, what's happening here? Pull over. -What? -I said, pull the car over. What the hell? Do what I tell ya! Jesus! What the hell is this all about? THOMAS: Stop the car. Hey, get that car out of here! MAX: See, this is what I'm talking about! Whoa. What you doing, making house calls? What's the deal? [WOMAN SPEAKING OVER POLICE RADIO] Excuse me. Can I be of some help here? Jeez, come on, guys, for Christ's sake! What are you doing? Would you watch it? Come on, move it on in there, take care. Hell of a mess, ain't it, Paul? Mind if I have a chew? -What happened here? -OFFICER: What happened? How the hell do we know what happened? These people don't talk to police down here. Eight years in this district and they're still not talking to us. It's all the same. Let me tell you a little secret. Nothing goes on in this neighborhood without old Papa -san over there knowing about it. You ain't seeing shit, are you, Papa -san? Why don't you just help this lady here? You're gonna be all right. Excuse me. Is there anything I can do? No. We do things our way. Hey, Father, you about finished here? Yeah. He's finished. Why don't you people all finish and just leave us alone? Don't let him get to you, Father. It's just the way of life down here in Little Saigon. MAX: So, what made you wanna see her now after all these years? THOMAS: Gave up denying the past. SAMMY: You know, you can do something for me, get me out of this neighborhood. Hey! Shut up. MAX: This is a bad idea, I'm telling you guys. -[SIGHS] -What about the agents? Do you know any good agents, like, who handles Woody Allen? Shut up! Just shut up! Listen, I don't think, like I was saying, I don't think this is a good idea. Maybe she's here, maybe she's not. -But I don't think... -Who is asking you to do anything? I'm out. Just do what you gotta do, pal. What are you looking at? You know something, Sammy? I'm gonna tell you something. You're not gonna make it in show biz. -You wanna know why? You ain't funny! -I'll make it! -I'll make it, all right! You just watch me, all right? -Yeah. -I'll be on the Johnny Carson Shownext year! -Oh! -SAMMY: You think I'm funny, don't you, Father? -[MUSIC PLAYING] -No. -[WOMAN CHUCKLES] Excuse me. May I have a word with the manager, please? [SPEAKING VIETNAMESE] I... I don't think he speaks English. Well, why don't you talk to him for me? You... You want me to tell this guy why you're here? Yes, please. Go ahead. [BOTH SPEAKING VIETNAMESE] Do you want to tell me what this is all about? Oh, well, he says it's been a long time since he's been to church. And he remembers how much fun he had when he was there. [WOMAN CHUCKLES] You know I'm gonna be great in this place. Women love me. A sense of humor is the most important element in a sexual relationship. Why don't you just wait outside, huh? -But... -Just do what I say. Thanks. Thanks for your help. Thank you. Hey, you wanna do something after work? No, thanks. Excuse me, Mrs. Wong, there's a priest here collecting money for the church. Very well. Merry Christmas, Mailan. Thomas? How did you find me here? Max told me how I could locate you. Is he still a friend of yours? No, no, no. Not exactly. I just didn't know any other way to find you. Now that I have, I'm... I'm not sure exactly what to say. Maybe it's better to say nothing. Mailan. I... I've come a long way to find out about my child. I see. So Max told you everything. I know Max for who he is. So do I. MAN: [OVER PHONE] Wong's residence? May I speak to Mr. Wong? Phone call, sir. Thank you. -Yes? -Sorry to disturb you, Mr. Wong. But something's happened here I think you should know about. There's a priest here talking to Mrs. Wong. And it seems that he's upset her. I see. Find out who he is. Yes, sir. And what he wants. We'll take care of him, Mr. Wong. -We need to talk. -No. We don't. What happened between us is in the past. Please believe me when I tell you, I never knew for sure. Oh, really? And after all this time, now you choose to find out? [COUPLE SPEAKING VIETNAMESE] You have no right to be here. We have our own life now. Well, I have the right to know my own daughter. [SIGHS] You have no right. You gave this up a long time ago. [WHISPERS] She's still my child. It doesn't matter now. She thinks you are dead. [WHISPERS] That's what you told her? Thomas, I have no choice. Is there a problem here? No. No problem. This is Father McCain. He was just leaving. Anything we can do for you, Father? No. I was just visiting. As a customer? Father and I, we knew each other a long time ago. -And where was that? -Saigon. Ah, as a priest? I was a soldier. It's all old story now. I see. Looking forward to seeing you again, Father. Let's go. Believe me, it's best you go back where you come from. Let us go now. Show the Father to the door. Hello, Father. -Something that I can do for you? -Move it. -Max. -Uh, what? They're taking him somewhere. -What? -The Hojo. The who? [SCOFFS] Wong's men! Oh, goddamn, the stupid son of a bitch! -[SWEARING] -Are we gonna do something or what? What am I, I look like a Good Samaritan to you? I gotta... Damn! Damn it! [ENGINE SPUTTERS] I... I got it. I got it. Come on, you skid mark, do it! [ENGINE REVS] [GROANS] So if you really are a priest, what is it that you want with the boss's woman? You used to know her before, is that it? Come on, you can tell us. [SHOUTING IN VIETNAMESE] [GROANS] So, Father, anything to confess? [BOTH GRUNTING] -Fuck you... -[GRUNTS] Come on! Back off! Back off or this will get as ugly as you! You're making a big mistake. Big mistake? You wanna discuss mistakes, Andy, huh? Boy! You're in the wrong part of town, Father. So far, I'm real impressed. What's it going to be, Father McCain's voice, huh? You're gonna open up a daycare center? What the hell is going on, huh? [GROANS] I leave you alone for 20 minutes, you piss Wong off, get the shit kicked out of you by his goop squad! What are you doing? What the hell do you think you're doing? I'm not really sure what I'm doing. I'm just doing the best I can, all right? Yeah. I thought you priests had it all wired. If this guy, Wong, finds out you're Lan's father, -you're a dead man. -Shut up. Give me something to wrap this arm with. I ought to wrap that collar around your head! You know the problems that you are causing in this town, huh? So who's this priest you were talking to today? What priest? The priest everyone but you seems to be talking about. This... This is not important. [STAMMERING] Just someone I knew a long time ago. How long ago? What difference does it make? Seemed to make a lot of difference to Mr. Wong. He seemed pretty upset. Upset? Why? What did he say? Well, if you're not going to tell me about the priest, I'm not going to tell you about Mr. Wong. Listen. I'm not in the mood to play games. I'm not in the mood to play any games either! I just wanted to find out about the priest, okay? Did you know him in Saigon? It's none of your business. Why isn't it any of my business? You always say the same thing! It's like we never existed before we came to the United States. Well, I did! He didn't know my father, did he? Stop it. That's enough! I tell you what I want you to know. And not any more! I have the right to find out who my real father is! If you don't want to tell me about him, then fine! I'll just go find out for myself, all right? Lan, all you know your real father died even before you was born. Now you must stop this now! You don't understand the problem you will bring to us! I'm sorry. Lan... You know I love you more than anything? Yes. We have survived so much together. -Yes. -You must trust me! You must leave the past alone. My baby. -[UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] -Nice crowd you got here. Yeah. Just like Saigon, huh? [CHUCKLES] Yeah. Well, you know, you just walk away. Yeah, your old solution for everything - turn your back and run. Okay. So, that's the real reason why you're here, huh? Believe me, pal, you're not the reason why I'm here. Bullshit! Okay, okay. So I ran, so I was scared. I thought you were dead. What the hell was I supposed to do? I... I didn't know you... You were in a prison camp until I got back stateside. What the fuck was I supposed to do, huh? So while your best friend's rotting in a POW camp for three years you run off with his girl. What a guy! Hey, don't run off. Goddammit that ain't how it came down. She begged me. I was just trying to be a good guy, you know. But Saigon followed me home like it did for a lot of us. Look, it must make you feel real good about it, not dealing with the real world, when you bury yourself in the mother Church, huh? After where I've been, pal, the Church is the real world. Yeah. Well, if the church is so goddamn good to you, why are you trying to get Mailan back in your life, huh? She has nothing to do with this! It has to do with my daughter! But a guy like you can't figure that out, can you? That's a nice thought. Having a Father for a father. Listen, Mailan belongs to Wong. Okay? And that means the kid, too. That's the way Mama -sanwants it, man. Well, it ain't the way I want it. Fine! Forget it! But I'm telling you, Wong ain't gonna let you get near that kid, you understand me? This is Sammy Chen for Eyewitness News. I'm here with two sleazy honkies arguing about one Asian chick. Shut the fuck up. Their problem seems to be one Mr. Wong, who runs girls, guns, and ganja out of Little Saigon. Word has it, he's moving into Disneyland. Film at 11:00. What about the police? The cops say they don't get involved down here, you see? What about the locals? You should check out my Uncle Minh. But he wouldn't talk to any white cops. Think he'd talk to a priest? He'd play poker with a rabbi! -Don't you have something to do? -Leave him alone. Look, do you think you could set up a meeting between this uncle of yours and me? I'll see what I can do. But it's going to cost you. A ticket to see Robin Williams. [LAUGHING] He's big in this community, ever since... [YELLING] Good Morning Vietnam! [HECKLING FROM CROWD] You frightened me. I'm so sorry. I have some gold to send to Saigon. Soon it'll be enough to buy your family's release. I owe you a great deal. That's not what I want you to feel. I'm here with you. Yes, I know. But I feel something has changed. [BIRDS CHIRPING] THOMAS: So, I really appreciate you taking this time to see me. [SIGHS] The old customs die hard. Change. Too much change. Things are going very fast here in America. So, my nephew says you could be trusted. Well, I just... Think, maybe I can be of some help to you. Oh. Really? You're here to help me? That's not what I heard. Actually it has something to do with this Mr. Wong. Wong? He's not your concern. Well, you know what he's doing to his community, don't you? Maybe. He's just trying to be another American success story. The man's a criminal. That's our problem. We'll fix it our way. So, you're just going to let this guy run your life? [SIGHS] He does not run my life. Besides, why are you so interested in the Vietnamese people? Well, let's just say, it's a debt I owe from the war. Ah! So, you're here to save us again? Well, listen, I'm sorry I bothered you. Thanks. MINH: Hey, Father. Wait a minute. I think I may know where you can find what you're looking for. But, if I take you there, you must do something for us. Yeah, sure. If I can. The locals around here won't let us bring our fish to market. Now, you stand up for us and they won't try anything with a priest there. Yeah. Sure. You got a deal. MAN: Pass me new one. Shit smells as bad as your sister, man. [ALL LAUGHING] [INAUDIBLE] [INDISTINCT SPEAKING] Hey. You ain't got no business here, boy. MAN: That's right. It's a free country, we have a right to bring our fish to market. See, you ain't got no rights round here, zipper head. This is America, kid. [ALL AGREEING] We have as much right to fish as you do. The market's open for everyone. Get your ass back to Saigon where you zipperheads belong. The market is closed for you, boy. Boys, good morning. Well, maybe I could be of some help here. Wait a second, Padre. These gooks here are stealing all our fish. [CLAMORING] Collar or no collar. You best stay out of it, Father. These people have every bit as much of a right to be here as we did. I don't give a shit! Well, considering that I'm a priest, I wonder if I might have a private moment with you. You know, being that I am a religious kind of guy if I were you, believe me when I tell you, if you don't get out of my way, I'll kick the living shit out of you. MAN: Hey, what kind of priest are you? Bless you. Hey! Weigh the man's fish. Make sure you pay him the same as you pay the other people. You heard me. Pay the man. Anybody else here need any help? -I don't give a shit who he is. -Get out of my way. -[INDISTINCT SPEAKING] -Where were you during the war, Padre? You need some help? Don't worry, it'll be all right. [GRUNTING] [ALL LAUGHING] MAN: All right. Okay, come on. Is that your girlfriend, Padre? Come on, it's all right. Okay, take it off, go ahead. Okay. So, what do you say, we just take the collar off we just do this all one on one. Just do this man to man, all right? Come on, let's do it, you're tough guys. Let's go. See you all at mass. It'll be okay. Good. HAROLD: Wong, my buddy, it's time to move, we've clients waiting. I don't like this business. What's not to like? This is the American way. All the other immigrants, the Italians, the Irish, the Jews, they were smart enough to take advantage of prohibition back in the '30s. You can do the same thing right now. But it's all a matter of timing, you wait too long, you lose everything. Don't touch. Look Mr. Wong, if you want me to run this side of your business... You're my attorney. And you are very, very well paid. But... All the decisions will be made by me. Then make a decision. What's the problem? It's that priest, isn't it? Look, if he has you messed up, let me handle it, so we can get back to business. I know women. Yes, well, I see your point uh, Mainland is none of my concern. You handle your domestic situation any way you please. Just know that I'm here if you need me. If you really need me, I'll be there. That has a familiar ring to it. God damn it. Why don't you just give it up, uh? What is it? Is it the kid, or does it have something to do with Mailan? Come on. It has something to do with me, pal. Minh is waiting in the car. -We doing this or what? -[SIGHS] You should never have come back here. When do we make our move? We're going now, but remember, once you go against Wong there is no turning back. You become the enemy. First you wanna play Father knows best, now you wanna go on a drug crusade. I just want to get my kid away from him. This is one way to do it. Let's go. [ENGINE STARTS] MAX: Last chance to bail out, Padre. THOMAS: Just drive. Now, we do it my way or nothing at all. All right? Are we playing Charlie Chan here, huh? [DOG BARKING] What do you want? I'm looking for a job. At this time of night? Aren't you a little old to be looking for a job here? [GRUNTING] Get him in. -What the hell are you doing? -[GUN CLICKS] I didn't come here to kill anybody. That's great. That's great. Come on, this way. Jeeze. I'm freezing my balls. There's the crate. Come on. Shit. Check this out. Wait a minute, I know this man, he was a fisherman who went up against Wong. MAX: I don't care who he is, I'm out of here. MINH: I care. These are my people. This is the reason I promised to help you. Right. -I'm getting the hell out of here. -No, wait here. Do it, come on. Let's go. [GUN SHOTS] Move, move. Let's go, keep moving. Do I have your permission to fire, Father? Or do you want to give them a sermon on gun control? Get back. Godammit, I'm not standing around here like peking duck. I'm hauling my old ass out of here. You're crazy, man, I could have stayed in the service and done 20... Damn it, I don't need this. I am not... [SCREAMING] Damn it. I can't take this anymore. I can't take this. Damn it. Damn it. Dropping out of a tree, these people, God... Max, come here... So what are you on? First name basis with these people? Yeah, everybody knows me, it's Max's Bar. Yeah, you're a real big man around here, aren't you? Come on, give me a hand with the crate. You want a hand with the crate, huh? You want a hand with your fucking crate? And you? You bring me down here for a box of fucking fish? Fuck. Oh! The old man was right. Holy shit! I'm in smack heaven. I don't believe this. Would you look at this? This is nirvana. Do it. God damn, Wong is gone big time. What are you gonna do with it? Don't you lay a hand on that, Papa -san. What's mine is mine. What are you talking about? What am I talking about? This is my big score. THOMAS: You're way out of line here, Max. Don't worry about a thing, Padre. I'll cut you in, you can build yourself a new church. I didn't come here to do business with him. Hey, you can nail Wong with those frozen popsicles in there if you want, -but, this is... -So what's the story, you're gonna be a dope dealer now? -Hey, do you think I'm fucking stupid? -Yes, I do. You don't get the big picture, do you? I rip this stuff off, sell it back to Wong. -Then what? -Then I'm in business. Hey, we never paid any attention to the chaps, now they own our asses. It's the same thing with the Vietnamese. These people are smart, they're taking over the 7/11s. The fucking laundromats. When is the last time you saw a white guy running a 7/11, huh? Hey, what the fuck are you doing? You old crazy, I'll kill you. You son of a bitch. God damn it. McCain, how come I can't get something out of this fucking shit world, huh? -Max, listen... -Now, fuck both of you mother fuckers. God damn it. I'm out of here. [TIRES SCREECHING] I thought we were going to the police with the evidence, why did you burn it? Don't worry. Be careful with that guy. Yeah. [SIGHS] According to this police report your men didn't actually find anything on my client's premises. Well, counselor, someone found this. Hmm. [SNIFFLING] Cocaine? Pure heroin. Oh! Very impressive. Yes it is. But, it doesn't really establish a chain of evidence does it? I mean, it's not enough for a warrant, is it? -I'm afraid you're right. -Hmm. How exactly can we help you, gentlemen? If Mr. Wong would cooperate it would certainly assist us in our investigation. Well, Mr. Wong can't possibly keep tabs on the activities of all his employees. But, naturally, if there's someone in his employ who's doing some wrong we'd like to know about it. You have my cooperation as always. Well, we certainly appreciate that. Thank you. And good afternoon, gentlemen. We're out of here. What are you, a freaking Foster Grant commercial? This priest is a problem. [DOOR CLOSING] MINH: Good afternoon, Father. The fishermen really appreciate what you did for them. You're a man of your word. I hope so. For my own sake. -Hi! -Hi! I'm Lan, Mailan's daughter. I hope you don't mind me wanting to see you. I know you're an old friend of my mom's. I heard there was a big argument or something, because you knew her back in Saigon. Yeah. Yes, I did. You didn't happen to know my father by any chance, did you? -Yes. -You did? Really? Could you tell me about him? I mean, was he like handsome or tall? [LAUGHING] [LAUGHING] I guess, I mean I don't know. I'm sure your mother thought so. [LAUGHING] Well... Well, what was he like? Did he really love my mom or... Was he like some of those other American soldiers? No. He loved her very much. Nice to hear. He made mistakes. And he wasn't perfect. Mom was always saying that. He was really brave and then saved a lot of people's lives before he was killed. Lan, I need to talk to you. Please, sit down. More than anything, your father would want what's best for you. I know, that if he could be here now... [SIGHS] He'd want you to know how proud he is to be your father. [CHUCKLES] And that, he loves you very, very much. I guess the war messed up a lot of people's lives, huh. Yeah, it sure did. Well, I got to go. But, thanks for talking with me. Oh... Anytime. Um... Do you think we could see each other again sometime? I'd really like that. [CHUCKLES] Great. All right. Well, then see you later. Yeah. Bye. I really need to talk to her mother. Can you help me with that? It's been arranged. [MUSIC PLAYING] MINH: This is one of the clubs not owned by Wong. But, it's still not safe. She's in the back, but don't take too long. She is risking much by being here. I'll wait for you at the bar. [SIGHS] Thank you for agreeing to see me. [SIGHS] You haven't changed much. Except from a soldier to a priest. 15 years. Yeah. It's a long time. You're still very beautiful. Did you ever think of me? Yes. God, I can't tell you... How I wish I could make up for things that happened in the past. You can't. Hey, hey, I was just dialing your number. I was just trying to get ahold of you guys. MAN: Where's the priest? Hey, listen, I had no idea he'd get involved with all these people, okay? Uh, hey, hey, he went to see Mailan. You'll find him at the Saigon cabaret. Minh set it up. You tell Mr. Wong that I ain't involved, I had nothing to do with it. You guys know me. Hey, wait a minute. Hey, come on, you guys. We ain't done yet. I saw Lan today. Did you tell her? No. No. I believe that's something that we should do together. Now that you've seen her it's best you leave. No. I won't do that. I can't know that I have a daughter here and just walk away from her. Why not? You did it to me. And I've had to live with that for these past 15 years. I'm so sorry. I know all about what you went through. But after that you could go home. How about me? A Vietnamese woman with an American soldier's child has no home. My family turned their back from me. No other Vietnamese would marry me. I was a disgrace to my own people. There is no way for my child and me to survive in Vietnam. Believe me, if I had known I would have been there for you. No you won't. You ran. You wanted to forget everything about Vietnam. I did not have to keep our baby. Many other women have buried their mixed children. But, I got her out. And I'm not going to let you or anyone take her away from me. I'm not trying to take her away from you, I just want to be a part of her life. It is impossible. Why? Because of this, guy, this Mr. Wong here? [SIGHS] Yes. He loves me. And he has the money to give my daughter a good life. What about you? How do you feel about it? You don't understand my situation. Thomas... [WEEPING] Do you think I like this kind of life? [INDISTINCT SPEAKING] I have always had to fight for my daughter. That would never change. Nothing will change. Not you. Not anyone else. Get out. Where's Mailan? I said, get out! [GRUNTING] Where is Mailan? Where are they? [CROWD SCREAMING] Minh. [CRYING] Mailan... [CRYING] Thomas, you see, this is not your world. Please go back to where you belong. Please. Live your life as the priest. Please. [WEEPING] Here's to you, Thomas. To all the shit and beauty in the world. All the spineless weasels like me. [SIGHS] And forgiving bastards like you, Father. Life's a bitch and then you die. You did the right thing, Max. [BIRDS CHIRPING] WOMAN: I don't know if you can do anything for me, Father. It's been two years since my last confession. I've been living with my boyfriend now for over a year. He come and go. We have kind of an understanding, you know what I mean? Well... Couple of months ago I got pregnant, he got scared, he thought that I was gonna force him into marrying me or something. Anyway, he left me. I couldn't handle the baby all by myself. I just couldn't. So, I had an abortion. Now I'm all alone. And I can't find my boyfriend. THOMAS: You're not alone. I'm with you. But isn't what I did a mortal sin? Will you please forgive me for that? There's nothing you can do that can't be forgiven. But, you are the one who has to do it. No, I need you to forgive me, I need you to tell me that everything's going to be all right. You must believe that God is all forgiving. You must try to reach Him, to find the strength to deal with the pain you're feeling. If I had the strength I wouldn't need to be here, Father. You don't understand, do you? What do you know about real people's problems? [BELL DINGS] [SINGING IN VIETNAMESE] [SPEAKING VIETNAMESE] THOMAS: Mailan. Believe me when I tell you how sorry I am about this. Thomas, please go away and leave us alone. Wong would rather see her dead than with you. So, it's because of him that she doesn't get to know her real father? It's too late. No, it's not too late. We can get some help, Max would get us out of here. Max won't do anything for you. What are you talking about? I used him to get Lan to America. He got angry because I wouldn't stay with him. Believe me, it was Max who told them we were in the nightclub. He's responsible for all of these. He hated me because I loved you. Can't you see? He drove us to Wong. There's nothing you can do. If you truly feel anything about our daughter, give us up. Accept things the way they are. [BELL DINGING] Mr. Wong wants to speak to you. Just come along quietly, huh, Father. I've had just about enough of you. Hey don't cause a scene, Father. It could be bad for your health. We don't wanna see anybody get hurt, huh? You don't belong here. Hey, you stay out of this, man. Let's go, Father. Leave him alone. It is none of your business, man. We make it our business. Maybe some other time, huh, Father. Well, if it ain't the messiah of Little Saigon. Don't get in my way. Why the hell did you come back, McCain. Why can't you forget the past? I'm gonna go get my kid out of here. And I need more than a rosary to do it. It ain't worth it. She don't even know who you are. I know who she is. And I know who you are, pal. What's that supposed to mean, Father? And don't give me your holier than thou bullshit. No more bullshit. No more absolution. Come on, let's go then. Let's do it. Come on. [GRUNTING] Come on, Father. Make me pay for my sins. [GRUNTING] Uh, come on. Come on. Why'd you have to hurt her? Why don't you ask yourself the same question. Come on! [MAX GRUNTING] [GASPING] Jesus! You are one hell of a tough guy for a priest. I'm awful sorry about this, Father. See the thing is, we're having some business problems and you are a big part of that problem. Why did you have to go and destroy that shipment? You now owe us a great deal of money, and frankly I don't know how you're going to repay it, not on your salary. Well, I guess I do know. Why am I telling you this? You know, I think it's because you're a priest and I don't get to see a priest very often I feel compelled to be honest with you. You're the most self-destructive son of a bitch I've ever met. I've never seen anybody go to such trouble to get themselves killed. Ah... Max, I just love what you've done to this place. Let him go. Don't point that gun at me. [SPEAKING VIETNAMESE] You're a dead man, Sammy. He always was... You just went too far. [GUNSHOT] [GRUNTING] Keep up the good work, Max. And the ammo. Come on. [MAX WEEPING] Oh, Jesus. Christ, always the kids. Why? You were funny. You little shit! Priest or no priest... You don't take what is mine. You know what I'm gonna do? I'm going to find something really nice tonight. Hey, Jo. How are you doing? How about this right here? It's nice. It's not a good color, right? It's not your size. Yeah, it's a pretty nice color. [GRUNTING] Tell me where they took him. Don't be stupid, Max. You'll get yourself killed for this. Listen, I am tired of you and all your bullshit, got that? Where'd they take him? Hey, I don't know man, they gave the job to Harold. Harold? You tell Harold I'm looking for him. You got that? -You're a dead man, Max. -A dead man, huh? Huh? [GRUNTING] How's that for your fucking martial arts, huh? [GRUNTING] Because of you, she suffered so much. And now you must pay. [GRUNTING] [HAROLD SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] [HAROLD LAUGHING] Where's he? Who? What? Where? What are you doing? You crazy? Crazy? Yeah! Yeah. I'm real crazy. I'm going to turn you into dog food, if you don't tell me where he is. Oh, yeah? Oh, yeah, asshole? So do it. Do it. [GASPING] He's at Wong's! Get the hell out of here. -Have another blast. -Ow! Oh! Get out! Get out! Get out! [GRUNTING] [BREATHING HEAVILY] [SIGHS] Let me talk to the boss. Mr. Wong. Mr. Wong. Max knows you have the priest. MAX: Christ, Tom. Jesus, man. [DOOR OPENS] What's going on around here? [SPEAKING VIETNAMESE] Take her up to her mother. Wong? What's going on? It's for your own good. Oh, come on. [GRUNTING] Oh, man. Skin's all ripped up. Get me my gun. You're okay, come on. Tom, I'm sorry, man. Let's go. Get my kid. Get my kid. My kid. You are not taking what's mine. It's all coming back down on us, ain't it? It's your call. LAN: Mom? Why are you packing? What's going on here? MAX: Wait a minute, wait a minute, let's even this out. [THUD] Come on. -You all right? -Yeah. Let's go. Get back. -Are you okay? -Yeah. Cross, cross. Move! [WHIMPERING] Let's go. Do it. Go! [GRUNTING] You're on your own, Tom. Get him. Tom, look out! [GASPING] [GASPING] -[GUN CLICKS] -Come along with me. Now. -Thomas, please go away. -Mailan, come with me. -No, please leave us alone. -You've to leave here, right now. What's going on here? MAILAN: No. Go away. Please, I won't leave here without you. Come with me now, and all this will end. Drop the gun. Drop it. Please, drop the gun. -Mama. What is going on? -Lan. This man is your real father. -What? -Listen to me. Wait, what are you doing? So, you've been lying to me my whole life? And you... -Priest, you lied to me? -Stop it! You belong to me. I gave you everything and no one can take her away from me. MAILAN: No! No! No! Fire! [SCREAMING] [CRYING] [LAN CRYING] God forgive me. [LAN CRYING] -LAN: Ma! -[SIREN WAILING IN DISTANCE] Lose the gun. [TIRES SCREECHING] Freeze, don't move. Stay still. LAN: It's been said that everything in our lives serves a purpose. That at each moment we're where we need to be. And that the path before us is clear. And if we don't see it, it's because we've chosen not to. My mother suffered and sacrificed all her life. My step father was the tragic victim of his own rage. And now I face the future with the knowledge of my true past. In one terrifying instance, I lost my mother and found my real father. Life is never what you think it would be. Every day is a new beginning. And now that we're together I know for the first time, who I really am.
