They're covering him up... ending up like this... Maurice, we were just speaking yesterday, just yesterday, we sat... I didn't get to say goodbye. I didn't see him. You're a widow like me. We are widows. A FILM BY RONIT ELKABETZ SHLOMI ELKABETZ Meir, Haim, you have to recite the prayer for the dead. What a tragedy has befallen us... -Haim, we have to recite the prayer. Your son is gone! He's gone! Masks! Masks! What should we do? Hold Mother. Don't move! The family stays here. Vivian, put on your mask. Mother, put on your mask. "Exalted and sanctified is God's great name. " -Amen. "in the world which He has created and may He establish His kingdom in your lifetime and during your days, and within the life of the entire house of Israel speedily and soon, Amen "May His great name be blessed forever and to all eternity "Blessed and praised, glorified, "extolled and honored, elevated, "and lauded by the Name of the Holy one, "blessed by he, beyond all the blessings "and hymns, praises and consolations "that are spoken in the world: and say" -Amen. "May there be great peace from heaven and life for us;, "and for all Israel and say 'Amen. " "Shiva" Seven Days Ita... What would I do without you? What a mess. -Not now, Haim, go inside, they're waiting for you. I'm sorry, Ita. Don't be. Do what has to be done and be done with it. Yes... Are you coming in? I'll come later. I'll find a solution. Sure. What's he doing here? What's wrong with you? He came for the prayers. Come to prayer... Sit down, Mother. -No, no, I'll sit on the floor. But the Rabbi said aloud you could sit in a chair, Mother. You can't sit on the floor like that in your condition. -No, no... It's forbidden. -Let her sit on the floor. Are you managing? -Everything's under control. -Good. What's that, Lilly? Gizzards. I can see they're gizzards. You don't eat meat during the mourning period. -We do. I'll ask Jacques. -Ask him. Gizzards... This is no time to be laughing. It's forbidden! Therese, make some coffee. Evelyn... Listen, I'm sleeping here with you. Have you gone mad? You can't. If you sleep here tonight, you'll have to spend the whole week here. And the children? -My sister. It's out of the question. -And if the voters come? As the wife of the next mayor, I should be here. Who'll make the effort to come during a war? - Mind your own business. I'm staying with you, my dear. Where's Ilana? Upstairs. He needs me here. What's this? Ilana, it's forbidden to sit on a bed. You can't stay here. Everyone has to come downstairs. We also have to cover the... mirror, the pictures, everything. There's no other way, Ilana, nothing else is acceptable. Do you seal this room? -No, we sealed Ronen's room. We checked it, it's small, Ilana. -Last week no one thought we'd be 40 people mourning Maurice in a sealed room. Please, Jackie, let me have this room. Trust me, Ilana, I understand you. But you know, it's only a week. Come down, everyone's waiting. Downstairs, downstairs. Ben Lulu, who arranged this house? I did. -You have to cover the pictures. You have to go through the house, make sure the mirrors are covered too. Don?t worry, Eliahu, everything will be all right. And the chairs have to face west, ok? It's not that complicated. We have to say the evening prayer in two hours. He's something else, that Ben Lulu. What would we do without him? What a guy. Hopefully, this week will be your big chance to hook him. How, exactly? I won't be here, I'm working. Take time off. Use your vacation days. Look... He takes no notice of me. She can't do anything before Eliahu gives her a divorce. He can keep on dreaming about Vivian until kingdom comes but if he still wants to have a family, you're his only chance. Why? You think he wants children? What man doesn't? What a disaster... Poor guy... Who would have thought he'd go like that? How come he's still single? He probably has lots of problems. -What do you mean? He's a real man! Like a lion. Look at that full hair. He has money. You know what? We'll ask Ilana. She'll know his story for sure. Right and she'll tell me? She barely says 'Hello' to me. Ilana. Look at this glass, Therese. Look what the poor guy spent his money on. Simona... If we hadn?t talked, I would have come crawling to you on all fours. God help us. Why? Why? Do you have to? It's an antique, it was just fixed. Ilana, there's no room for the mattresses. Where will we sit? But not on those cushions. Of course not, Ilana. We'll lean against the wall, don?t worry. Wrap everything in plastic. it'll be okay. We'll do it in Ronen's room, Okay? This family is wasting time on nonsense. Ben Lulu, put on a yarmulke. I'm going upstairs. Where's Morris? Where is he? What a shame, what a shame that he died. What, Ruthie. They're waiting for me outside. -I don't care. Did you send people to see the house? Yes. Did they see it? -No. Why should I show them my house? Who are they? Did you explain to them that my brother died? Yes, yes, but what's going on, Itamar? I want to sell the house. What? What are you talking about, Itamar? Sell? I'm not selling my house. -Quiet. I don't understand you. What's come over you? Forget it, it's complicated. -So explain it to me. It doesn't concern you. It concerns me and I... I don't want to get into it now. Why you? Is anyone else selling his house? Say... weren't you supposed to sing at Zaguri's Bar Mitzvah? 3 performances were cancelled because of this war and now this? You know, now you won't be able to perform for a whole year. That's how I make a living. I don't sing for my pleasure. You have to ask the Rabbi. -So we'll ask the Rabbi. Simona, what are you doing outside? Smoking. -So smoke inside, dear. Well? And take off your jewelry. We don't need people to talk... Come on... What's wrong? Ben Lulu, did you get a hold of Orbach? -I'll see him tomorrow morning. I'm counting on you, get as much as you can out of him. Be pleased for whatever he offers you. Why? The equipment alone is worth half a million. He won?t give you what it's worth. -So we'll sell to someone else. Who will you sell to? -It's a viable business. -It's going bankrupt, Haim. When tomorrow morning? -I'm meeting him at 8 o'clock. I'm sorry you have to deal with it, Ben Lulu. Thank you very much, really, I won't forget this. -Don?t worry. Let's hope everything works out. Would you like a cup of tea or some Arak? I'll be down in a minute. My back is killing me. The family has found itself two maids. Where is everyone? What is this? Lilly disappeared. Iris has such nerve, sitting in the living room like a guest. Did you see Ruthie? She's not talking to anyone. Ita hasn't even come in here. You're lucky I'm here... It's a good deed. Maybe, with God's help, it'll earn you a husband. Yeah, right! Vivian, do you want a cup of tea? -No, no, darling. Is everything all right? -Yes. Do you have everything? -Yes. Have you seen Lilly? -No. Breathe... I've got a good feeling about Ben Lulu. Come tomorrow, wear something nice, catch his eye. Vivian is not at her best. I don't think he cares. Oh, Ben Lulu. Everything all right, girls? Everything's fine, Ben Lulu. Did you happen to see Vivian? -Vivian? No, I don't know. Siren! a motorcycle... Sadam Hussein will give me a heart attack. Vivian. What, Ben Lulu? Do you need anything? Can I help with anything? You've done more than enough. Everything's fine. "Exalted and sanctified is God's great name. " -Amen. "in the world which He has created and may He establish His kingdom "may his salvation blossom and his anointed near. " -Amen. "in your lifetime and in the lifetime of all the House of Israel "Swiftly and soon. Now say "Amen. " -Amen. "Blessed are you, God, through whose word everything comes into being. " Amen. Excuse me, since when do we eat meat when we mourn? Iraqi Jews do. -We don't. It's not customary... It's not acceptable! Do I have to tell you that? Fine. So they made a mistake. Here, no one will touch it. Right, do whatever you want. Evelyn, honey, take the meat off the plates. God bless you, Evelyn, no one cooks the way you do. Freeze it till next week. -What nonsense... I didn't make it. This isn't my first time in a house of mourning. As if I don't know you don't eat meat. It's a known fact. It's a known fact? Then who made it? Enough already. "Who made it, who brought it... Enough!" What difference does it make? Gizzards, hearts... Maurice loved that... He'd kill for it. all the inner parts! Brains, intestines... kidneys, liver, hearts, bladder, testicles. Innards are Lilly's specialty. God bless you Lilly, God bless you all. But no one makes intestines as well as Mother. How Maurice loved this. He'd wait for it every Passover. He'd eat it almost straight out of the pot. He liked it so much. He used to say to me, "It's good, Mom, it tastes so good... " Oh God... He went, just like that. How is that possible? In a flash, Meir, a flash... He's dancing the whole night smiling at everyone and is gone in a flash. He told me so many times that evening, "I love you, Ilana. " As if he knew his time was up, I said to him, "Maurice, let's go... let's go, Maurice, let's go home. " He said, "No... "one more dance, one more song... " until 4 a. m., he wanted to dance. He liked to dance, poor soul, especially rock and roll. The dance ended, he fell to the floor, I shouted, "Maurice, Maurice!" Everyone came running, lifted him up... On the way before we got to the hospital he was already gone, dead. Just like that, a stroke took him away! God have mercy on him. May he rest in peace. Zanati, listen to me. Did you see my face? What do you mean the color is off? But I look as white as a boiled egg! What do you mean, "we can't do anything about it"? It has to be ready today. I don't stand a chance if his posters are ready before mine. That's... that's cheating! Of course. My voters won't recognize me. God forbid, what's going on there? She's pretty, Evelyn. She's a whore. Why do you say that? -Because she's a whore. No, I know her. She's a good girl. I don't know... Meir wants to be mayor. No, he just wants to work. It's good, it's good... Girls, enough already! Mother Hanina, are you all right? Open your eyes. Actually, you look good in the poster. Your face is lit up. We got such compliments on the jingle. We'll record it after the week of mourning, okay? -God willing. But remember, I sing the jingle. Okay, with God's help, David. If he wins, he'll take care of his family! Don?t say it. It gives the evil eye! Why do you say that to me? -That's what they say, you know. Are you saying that I'll bring him bad luck? No, of course not, it's just better not to talk about it. Okay, I'll keep quiet. Evelyn, what is this circus? You're embarrassing me. Take that stuff off. -Okay, okay. Ben Lulu? -Meir... A cup of tea? -No thank you, I'll bring you one anyway. Meir, I have to go back to work, they haven't seen me in two days. If you need anything, let me know. Thank you. -Hi Jacques. I know it's none of my business, but you have to talk to Haim. -About what? We spoke last week, We all got together. I see. There's no way out, Ben Lulu. The plant is finished, that's it. I see. But still... I understand but you should still talk. Maybe you'll come up with something. Drop it, Ben Lulu. It's complicated, it's a family matter. Okay, Jacques, okay. You know best. What does Ben Lulu want? I showed him where he belongs! What does he think, that I'm not thinking of my brother? Oh, great. I didn't want to insult him so I didn?t say a word. I'm wracking my brains... thinking about Haim, and he comes and says that. Meir, you have to talk to Haim and tell him. -Tell him what? To close down the factory, to end this story already. Can you tell him? -What does he want? That we sell our homes? -He didn't ask us to do anything. That's what he expects us to do. Let me think. I have an idea. Look at Mom, God help her... Wait, Meir, it's for Ben Lulu. -He left. And take that butterfly off already! Why? I'm not in mourning. Don't piss me off, Evelyn, okay? What are you doing here anyway? Don't you have to work? I took time off. -Off? What for? To help Therese. So go to the kitchen. And take that lipstick off. Okay. Okay. Oh, Evelyn. What is that butterfly? Ita, where's Haim? -Upstairs. He has a migraine, leave him alone. What upstairs, he can't be up there. Excuse me? He has a headache, I gave him a strong pill. What? I broke a fingernail. Haim. Is everything all right? -Yes. We start praying soon. Does it still hurt? Did the pill help? -Yes. It's okay, Ita, it's okay. -We'll be downstairs. I'm coming down. My uncle just called from Germany. He's sorry he can't come. He liked Maurice. -Yes... We'll call him later on. I'll talk to him, Ita. He'll understand. Don't tell me "He'll understand", Haim. I want you to talk to your brothers. -What should I say to them? Why are they keeping quiet? What do you want them to do? They worked for me, Ita, they weren't my partners. They were paid employees. Excuse me, you can't buy a house in 3 years on an employee's salary. You were very good at spoiling them. -Enough, what's done is done. I can't tell them now, "give me back what I gave to you. " It's done. So why don't they offer it themselves? Why... God knows why. Everyone's busy with his own affairs. Your brothers have no shame. Just four years ago they each had a... miserable shop front and could hardly feed these kids. Forget about them Ita, drop it. You don't know how it feels not to have money, you've always had it. And why do you think I did all that I did for them? So that I could come back a few years later and say, "Give it back to me. "? -You "did for them"? Yes, for them, so they could raise their heads, make a new start. Haim, you did it for yourself. So that you'd have something of your own. -Why do you say that? What's wrong? The plant was doing well. Why shouldn't I share with my brothers? The factory succeeded thanks to them too. Succeeded... the one time I didn't intervene and look what happened. You're enjoying this, aren?t you? You're enjoying seeing me humiliated, weak. Tell me, are you crazy? What are you going on about? All I'm asking is you pay my uncle back the money you owe him. Otherwise, my mother will drive me to my grave. Okay, it's time for prayer. Drop it now, I have to go downstairs. I don't understand. Why? Why did you need all this? Did I ever stop you from doing anything? You could have lived like a king on my money. Yes, your money, your uncle, your mother, your houses, your Germany, even our girls are yours. What do you want from me? What? What about me? Where do I figure into all of this? You're right where you wanted to be. Don't blame me. Tell me, do you think I could have continued driving around in a Volvo while my brothers could barely afford a Bittle? How would it look? When they'd come for help I never said no, I always helped. Leave me alone now, I told you I'd take care of it and that's what I'll do. I always gave them when they asked. -What do you want, Ita? What? Do you want me to fight with them now? Now? With my brother dead? Is this the right time? What? I can't decide for them. I spoke to them a week ago. They know exactly what's going on. I can't do any more than that. Nothing. It's no wonder your father loved Maurice more that anyone else. What kind of nonsense is that? He left him the two shops, didn't he? Why? Ita, stay out of it. It's none of your business what my father gave or didn't give. Drop it. -Haim. -Drop it. "Be the Name of the Holy One, blessed be He. " -Amen. "far beyond all the blessings and hymns, praises and consolations "that are spoken in the world; and say, "Amen. " -Amen. Lilly What are you doing here? What's wrong, honey? I had to come upstairs. Come, come, honey. Let's get out of here before Ilana comes up and sees us. What's wrong? I know, I know... He was so handsome. He was worried. He wasn't himself this past year. It's all her fault. Stop, cherry. What does it matter now? Come. He told me. She wouldn't let him relax. The expenses, the traveling... He was fed up. Who needs such a big house? She sucked him dry, Vivian. That's what they wanted... they wanted it. Come, let's go. I would have left Jacques for him. You didn't help me with this, Vivian. You were no help. I was worried about you. I was afraid for you. Lilly... Maurice wouldn't have left Ilana for you. Maybe for a stranger. But a brother would take another brother's wife? You were dreaming. He'd die before he'd do something like that. He died. Your brother is dead, Vivian, dead. We've been looking for this for over an hour. What, cherry? -Mommy wants her purse. Do you know where it is? -Yes. -Good. We'll look downstairs. Come here, cherry. Good, take it to your mother. He's waiting for you. Let him wait. I'm waiting too. -Vivian... Lilly, Lilly. I want to have a few words with her. So does she, Eliahu, but it's not a good time. Wait until this week is over. Therese... Tell me, what did I hear... Are you and Meir selling the house? -What are you talking about? No, I just heard, someone told me. I don't remember who. That I'm selling the house? We just finished building it. Ita and Haim are the ones selling the house in Kiryat Motzkin. Start serving. They're starving. I brought Arak. Look at her. She hasn't lifted a finger. She's depressed. -She wants to be an actress... What does that have to do with it? She should first have a baby. She doesn't want to. It's too soon. Leave her alone. Right, an actress... 30 years old, from Kiryat Yam. Who would want her? She has an extra uterine device -Intrauterine. Intra. Not extra. Poor Charlie. What about you, Evelyn? -Me? What about me? I'm as dry as the desert. -Why? Today, you can have babies at 50. 48. -47 -I'm not 50, Ita. 44 and a half. And I won't have a child without a man. You're stupid. Your sister is stupid, Therese. Go figure out from whom... Disgusting... who knows where it came from... Nowadays you can chose a tall, thin, blond man with blue eyes, a professor, an engineer from the Technion. Where is he? -He'll come. He'll be here. -With God's help. -Let's start serving. It probably costs a lot, no? I'll pay for it. I will pay for it. Anyway this family has cost me a lot. Who's snoring? Who's snoring? Who is that? Therese... What's wrong, Haim? -Therese. -Therese. Haim, where's Ilana? It sounds like a carpenter's shop. It sounds like she was born in an industrial area. Simona, you're in a good mood tonight. What's that smell? You let off one. I can recognize the smell. You let go at night... Ilana come, come and see the future mayor's wife. Haim, Haim... -Meir, Meir... Zanati with the posters. Meir... -Meir, come on, get up. You have a phone call. From the municipality. They want you on the phone. Hello. Who is this? Get lost! Therese... Therese... Therese! The siren? Missiles? Where's Meir? -I'm here. Meir, listen to this... "Ohayon is the one "Meir Ohayon is better than all the rest "Kiryat Yam deserves the best... "so cast your ballot for Meir Ohayon, he's the one. " David, David, this isn't the time. But it's good, isn't it? It's better than what Ben Harush suggested. -Yes, yes. Meir... look at Haim. Look. -I'm looking. Don't worry, I might have an idea. What? What? -Something. Won't Haim notice that we're here? -He's asleep. I want to talk to you in private. David... -You went upstairs without telling me? I'm sorry, I couldn't find you. We were hurrying. Sit down. -You could have called me... Look, yesterday Haim left the house, he was gone for three hours. I think he went to the factory. -He had a headache, he was in the room. Stop defending him! He wasn't here. He went out? -Jacques, please, don't be a hypocrite. Let's talk before we lose him too. May he have a long life... -God forbid! Don't say that. What do you think killed Maurice if not the pressure and the money? You don't understand. You don't appreciate Haim's situation. If he the factory closes, he will be in debt and will lose everything he has. Ita will throw him out and take the girls. That's why I called you. Let me talk. I have an idea. -What? Look, Jacques, what did our poor father have? Two shops in the old center. That's what he left, right? -So? Vivian used one shop for her beauty salon for a few years, and gave it back. -Go on. And then Maurice, God rest his soul, took the two shops for his business and didn't give them back. -So? -And he died. Explain already. -Why are you pressuring me? I'm trying to explain something. -Okay, sorry, sorry, go on. Dad didn't leave a will and Maurice, rest his soul, took the two shops, and continued working there. -So what are you trying to say? He has 6 more brothers and 2 sisters. -Right. -So what are you thinking? Look, as long as things were going well, we kept quiet. But now, when there is nothing, we have to divide it up. -How? We have to talk it over with Ilana. -Have you no shame, Meir? -Why? Is this the time to take away a widow's only source of income? Why "only"? Why "only"? She has Maurice's share in Ben Lulu's business, and he'll give her her share. We'll sell the stores and give the money to Haim. What are you talking about? Maurice had nothing with Ben Lulu. Maurice died penniless. They don't have a cent to their name. You think Ilana will continue living so well? They'll have to sell this house too to pay back his debts. How will it look, letting a stranger look after our brother's widow? Ben Lulu? -Yes, what's wrong? Let him take care of her. Besides, I'm not worried about that woman. She'll get her claws into Ben Lulu herself. You'll see, she won't remain a widow for very long. What's he going on about, Meir? Itamar, if we?re already talking, she really doesn't care about us. What's the matter with you? That's no way to talk. She told Maurice to change their surname. She didn't want the name "Ohayon" on her door. Is that nice? She didn't care about the family, if not for her, he'd still be alive. Don't let anyone hear this. -Okay, enough. Meir, what are you saying? I repeat, I'm prepared to give my share of the shops for the factory, to Haim. You don't understand. She was left with nothing. You should be ashamed of yourselves. If God forbid something happened to me that's how you?d care for my wife? If that?s the case, then there's no solution. I don't have any money. Meir, we are Haim's partners. Partners? I'm a partner? Why, did I get any profits? Did anyone share the dividends with me? I'm an employee, an employee. And so are you, Meir. And you, Itamar, an employee. It's not our problem. Haim, he is the boss. We are just employees. -Right. You forget how much we wanted it, how we convinced him to join us, that he invest his money, his wife's money. Right, he was our boss, but he treated us like partners. He never told us what to do. He never asked us to repay him. We are partners! That's true. I'm ready to give my house. To give everything I have. What are you prepared to do? What do you stand to lose, David? A one bedroom apartment in Kiryat Yam? -Jacques. What? No, I'm talking brass tacks. What do you stand to lose? You don't have a wife or kids. What? Are you making fun of us? And what are you? A wedding singer. You worked part time. You came at 12:00 and left at 16:00. Now you come and want to tell us what to do? Jacques, everyone gave what he could, and was paid accordingly. You think you can manage on your own, right? The factory made us strong. God help you. David's right. -David's right? You want to sell your house too? You can also offer your house and Lilly's store... What's the matter? Should we leave him hanging? You want to make me out to be the bad guy, is that it? Why should I be responsible for a place where I was just an employee? What are you asking me to do, Itamar? Live in the street? I finally put a roof over my family's head at the age of 48. And now I have to take a chance? What if it doesn't work, what if it fails? What do I do then? It's better only one of us falls, that way we can help out a bit. We have to help now. -Itamar, I swear... I'm invested in this election up to my last shekel. I swear to you on Dad's grave, I have nothing left. Where will I go now with five children, my wife and her poor sister who won't leave us. May God take her away for us! -Okay, is that why you called us? It's between you and yourselves. Only we know what we have or don't have. Go call Charlie. Charlie! Meir, the family's in a mess. We have to straighten it out. You're the eldest, it's your job. -And who will let me? I don't know. What's going on? -Sit down, Charlie. Tell me, Charlie, you were very close to Maurice the last few years. Tell us, what's his situation? We're worried. What exactly are you worried about? How do his affairs concern you? Did he leave Ilana anything? He would have told you himself, if he had wanted to. Don't be rude! There are some problems, okay? We need to know what to do with the shops Maurice took from Dad. I don't know anything. Don't you hear what we're saying? Dad's shops. Don't play dumb. Answer! The family is in trouble. Leave me alone, Jacques. I don't know anything. Has this family lost its values? What's this supposed to mean? Are you doing this on purpose or what? Tell me. You used to be able to grab me by the shirt and I'd tremble in fear. You, and you, Meir. Lay a finger on me again and I'll break your bones. Let him go... The nerve! Lilly... What's this I hear... You're selling the house? What are you talking about, Evelyn? Our house? I'm not selling any house. Who told you that? No one said anything to me. I'm looking for a house in the area. Your area is nice, right? -Finally, you're leaving Meir and Therese. How much longer can I go on living there? Right... Good for you. Let's go out. They're waiting for us. Why did you turn it up? Turn the radio off. We have to know what?s happening. I'll turn it down after the news. But you can't. Turn it off now. -No. One more minute. It's a matter of life and death. It's not for our listening pleasure. There's a war going on. -There's nothing to hear. The minute there's a siren, it will come on automatically. That's what we need, nothing more. He's right. It's not allowed. "Blessed are You, Lord, our God, King of the universe, through whose word everything comes into being. " -Amen. What's wrong, Ruthie? What's the matter? You care about the radio but not about your family. That's the heart, it works one day, and the next day you're gone, Aaron. No, no, no, It's not possible. His heart was fine. He stopped smoking three years ago. How? Why? -Why? He was at a party... Efi's birthday... -It's a pity he went to the party. We danced until 04:00. I wanted to go home, he said one more drink. He was in a good mood, he wanted to continue dancing... like that time in Turkey. What a hotel we had... What luxury, gold faucets, an open bar French, Italian, stirfry in abundance. -He knew how to pamper himself. Maurice knew how to drink. He could put away 7, 8, 10 shots. Hi, Jacques, is everything all right? My stomach hurts. It's been 2 days since my last bowel movement. That's what happens when you're not at home, you get constipated. Do you want a laxative? -No. My stomach is a mess as it is. How are you? Are you tired, sweetie? -I barely slept a wink. My love, there are enough people helping. Lie down, come back later. No, no, it's okay. Jacques... My heart... My flower... -This isn't the time. Honey, lately you've been keeping your distance. You know what I want? To buy you that ring you had your eye on last year. This isn?t the time to be wasting money, Jacques. You haven't received a salary in three months. Honey, if Meir wins these elections everything will be fine. -Why? What are you planning? I'll work with him. -And the factory? I don't know Lilly, it's dead. The factory is dead. -And Haim? We'll see. You think the municipality will pay as well as Haim did? Baby, there are options in politics. -Options... What's going on? Evelyn asked me if we?re selling our house? What's that nonsense? She asked you if we were selling our house? -Yes. What, you think it has to do with the factory? Lilly, I suggest you stay out of it. It's complicated. Baby, God willing, as soon as this month is finished, you and I will pamper ourselves at the Princess Hotel in Eilat. You're starting a year's mourning, this is no time to be partying. Who's partying? We won't leave the room, my sweet. He died exactly when the weekly Torah portion spoke of gifts. A man who gave to the poor his whole life. -That's right. I went and asked the Rabbi... They're not talking. -Of course they are. You have eyes but you see nothing. I see just fine. I have my contact lenses. Hanina, Hanina! What? -What's wrong with Vivian and Simona? What's wrong? -They're not talking to each other, are they? No! They are. Why? I don't know. -Why do you say you don't know? Shut up! You don't understand anything. I understand very well. -What? What do you understand? They were hugging and kissing two days ago... They buried their brother, why shouldn't they hug and kiss, you fool? I'm a fool? You don't understand anything. That Simona is a tough cookie. That's enough talk about my daughters. Enough! Okay. I'll be quiet. David, did you hear what happened yesterday? Some poor Yemenite from the Hatikva neighborhood choked. Really. He put his mask on, left the plug in and choked to death. God help him, poor soul. I'm telling you they're hitting us because of the refineries. "Blessed is He who diverts missiles from their path. -Amen. I wish a missile would land on the factory! That would fix things, Haim. You know what that would mean? If there is a God, let it fall. Not only won't we lose money, you'll end up being compensated by the government. Why? Does God do business with you? Really... What's wrong with Ruthie? -She's difficult, difficult... That's your solution, Meir? What? Do you want to talk? Why not? I don't want to now. Okay. Whenever you want to. Lock the door. Vivian... Oh, Ben Lulu... everything's okay. Say I talk to her, what good will it do? Don't worry, I'll talk to her today. That's how it is with women. You'll make up today. Meir, you're the eldest, put some pressure on her. Talk to her. If Maurice was alive, he'd persuade her. Did it help you when he was alive, poor soul? -She listened to Maurice. I have one! Maybe you should tell her... that you're prepared to divorce her. That way, you'll slowly start to talk to one another. Don?t worry. The mourning period in particular is the ideal time to make up. It's a known fact. Meir, I'll kill myself but I won't divorce her. I'm not saying you should, just say that you will. I don't do things that way. Tell her that... Tell her... Tell her I love her. Okay. Vivian? -What, Meir? I have to talk to you. Eliahu... is here. -Meir, I don?t want to hear another word. Not a word. Vivian, listen... -Leave me alone. Please. Exchange a few words with him and that's it. Nothing more. Why should I talk to him? -Calm down, let's drink some coffee. I want him to leave... What's going on? -Everything's fine. You see her... -Let her be. Let her do what she wants. -No. I always give in to her. And you know what? I'm mad at her, too. I'm mad at her too and she should know it, and not think she's always right. -You see how she is with everyone. So what? Am I her slave? I won't have her always vent her anger on me. Enough! She always did that, she'd be mad at someone and would take it out on me. Enough! I'm fed up. You're upset now, forget it. -That's right. -Listen a minute. I don't like her... I don't like her anymore. I don't love Simona anymore! She knows. What? Who? Ilana. -What? What does she know? I can tell. She won't look me in the eyes. Stop it. What kind of nonsense do you have in your head now? I wish I could disappear. -Where exactly would you go? I'll tell Jacques I don't feel well. I can't, I don't feel well here. Ilana, the children, his things. It's driving me mad. -I know. I know, Lilly. I'll tell him when the mourning period ends. -What will you tell him? That I'm leaving him. -A lot can happen until then. You know what, go. Go now. Go on, get some rest. Come back tomorrow. I thought we'd see more of Ben Lulu. He gets up early for morning prayers and goes to work... You get up early, too. I get up at 7:00 to come here. Should I get up at 5:00? -I don't know. The toilet has to be cleaned. Someone left it dirty. Take the bleach. So I have to clean it? Who will do it? I made a great sauce... Ben Lulu... Excuse me, Evelyn. What's wrong? -Later. Ben Lulu? How are you? -Fine. Anis? I'll go serve them. I'm fine. I'm going... My tomato sauce really came out good this time. Ben Lulu, would you like a sandwich? -No thank you, Evelyn, I have to go. Won?t you have something to eat before you go? No thanks. Ben Lulu... I... it's my birthday. -Oh, congratulations, Evelyn. I'm making a small party at home in two weeks time. I'd like to invite you. Will you come? I'll come. Sure, why not? I'll come. We'll talk later? Sure, sure, later, not now. Okay... congratulations. -Thank you. So? I invited him. -Where to? To my birthday party in two weeks. What birthday? What do you want? Should I ask him to invite me to some fancy restaurant? But it isn't true. We'll make me a birthday party and we'll invite him, that's all. Sure and Meir is really going to let you make a party now. What do you want? -I want to talk to you. We have nothing to talk about, Eliahu. Soon it'll be Shai's Bar Mitzvah and I thought... -What? I want you to come back home. I'm not coming back, Eliahu. -Why not? Living in some dive, like a dog. -I'm happy where I am. Vivian, I'll do whatever you want. Come back. I want a divorce. -I'll never give you a divorce, do you hear? Never. I'll kill myself first, Vivian. Move. Let me go. Vivian, think about it, you stand to lose everything. What will you gain by being so stubborn? Look at you. You're not young anymore, you have 4 children. What do you have to offer? Nothing. Who will have you? Remember this day, Eliahu. You'll beg me yet for a divorce. You think I'm looking for a husband? No, I have my work. I have a place to rest and I have peace of mind. That's all. I have everything I need. Everything. I've been waiting for 3 years. 3 years! I won't wait much longer. Someone will come along that I'll like, I'll go with him. I won't think about you Eliahu. And what will they say about you? A married woman looking for men... If I waited till now, it was only for your honor, Eliahu, not mine. I couldn't care less what they say. I'll go to movies and to cafes and the whole world will see and then the shame will be on you, on you, Eliahu. So if you don't give me a divorce not only will you lose me, you will also lose your lousy honor. Mark my words. I never could talk to you. The minute I open my mouth, you attack. What do you want? Get out of here, go. What do you want? They'll get along just fine without you and your grimaces. I don't want to stay here either. No one respects the dead here. There's no respect for your brother. You're talking about business and money instead of praying for him. His soul won't get to heaven. It's forbidden, Vivian. Forbidden. You'll all pay for this. The whole family will pay for this. What are you talking about? -What? Who's talking about money? Go on, if you don?t want to be here, get out of here. Your brothers don't deserve my respect. I'll never set foot in this house again. Don't bother... scaring us. Go and don't come back! You're cursing me? Watch your mouth, Vivian. You be careful. -No, no, you watch yourself. No, you be careful. -Me? I should be careful? Yes, you. You be careful. Be careful, be careful. Be careful, I'm telling you. I mean it. Why, what did I say? Nothing. Nothing, you never say anything. Leave me alone. We'll see what will become of you. We'll see. I'm going home. Poor Maurice. You can say "sorry. " I don't feel like it. What do you want from me? What? From the day we came here, poor Maurice, she hasn't stopped glaring at me with those eyes of hers, and never says anything. I said to her, "Let's talk", but she didn't want to. What did I do to her, what? Here, in front of all my brothers, tell me what you want. She's treated me like this for 2 years and I said nothing. Nothing! I've had it. I don't want to talk to you. Just a minute, Vivian, Simona, what's going on? What's going on? What? You don't know anything, right? She always finds opportunities to insult me. If I hurt her, let her tell me. Let her tell me. I'll get down on my knees and ask for her forgiveness. Let her tell me. Enough. Make up, hug each other, end this story. Enough already! Not that hug again. It's the same old story every holiday, every occasion. We come, we make up, we hug, we kiss and then she doesn't talk to me. What for? For the sake of this mourning period, for Maurice, his memory. Tell me already what's bothering you and we'll stop this shit. You're enjoying this, aren?t you? Making yourself miserable in front of everyone. What about you? What are you looking at? You're all hypocrites. What, Meir? Sticking yourself in my face. Fuck off, all of you! -Simona! Simona, what? You want to raise your hand to me? Go on, raise your hand. Be a man. Do you miss it? Did I ever raise my hand to you? Me? I never raised a hand to you. -Simona, what is this? You shut up too. I can't stand the sight of you anymore. Now calm down... -Meir, Meir... Do you hear me? Enough! -Don't touch my sister. I'm not afraid. I spit on all of you. Meir, Meir, move. Let me talk to her quietly. Forget it, Haim. Someone has to set things straight here. And you're the one who'll do it? Since when? Maurice was the only one who did it before and now he's gone. Maurice is dead. Gone! Sure you'll do it... -Like... What's wrong with you? Have some respect for the week of mourning. Oh no, there she goes again. Get her out of here. I don?t want to see her anymore. May God take me... May God take all of you, amen. You should be ashamed. -What are you doing? Meir! -You bastard! Enough! What's wrong with you? Meir. Move. Enough of your nonsense. Shut up once and for all. We're fed up with your fits and your filthy mouth. -You're fed up? You've had enough? You'd rather come here and hug, and kiss, and then give each other the finger behind your backs? I say what I have to say up front. You can blow a fuse, for all I care. God help us, what's wrong with you? Enough! It's not enough! -Enough! -No, it's not. When my Micha was alive, you knew how to come over, and eat at our expense, drink, borrow money you never returned. You licked his boots. Now that he's dead, no one comes anymore. 2 years. No one has set foot in my house in 2 years. No one asks, "Do you need anything, Simona?" "How are you managing, Simona? "Do you need any help?" You forgot my name. You'll see, Ilana, in another week they'll forget you too. She's right. None of you ever considered that maybe she needed something... nothing. She was the one who cut off contact. She didn?t want to talk to anyone. She didn't answer the phone, nothing. So we gave up. You don?t call in a situation like that. You get in the car and come. She's your sister. -Shut up. You, shut up. That what know how to do, ah...? To hit and shout... Where is all this hatred coming from? What's wrong with you? Charlie, Simona, shame on you. All of a sudden your big shots. Raising your heads. -You should be ashamed! You should! You, Itamar. And you, Jacques. Who, if not my Micha, helped you start your businesses? You came to him, took 80,000 NIS, it's all written down. I still have his notebooks. Did you pay him back? Like hell. He never saw a cent. When he died, Maurice took over his business, as it was. with the equipment, his employees. He promised to give me 3000 NIS a month. In the end he paid me for 10 months and then disappeared. I never heard from him and didn't see him again until he died. Ilana, tell me, isn't that true? He went bankrupt, you know that! The business fell apart without Micha. -I'd call him, he wouldn't return my calls. Isn't that so, Ilana? Tell me, isn't it? I don't know. I wasn't involved in Maurice's business affairs. Okay, enough. Don't answer her. She's right. Leave her alone, enough. You keep quiet. Shut up. I can't stand to hear your voice anymore. She's crazy. Simona's gone crazy. Enough. -Crazy? Crazy? Crazy with an evil eye. With a big evil eye. Oh, you're scared? Are you afraid of my evil eye? Is that why you want me to shut up? You were always afraid of me. You were afraid I'd put a jinx on you. You were afraid I'd put an evil eye on your children. You were always afraid of me. You were afraid I was jealous. Of what? Of what, Simona? Of what? My shitty life with Eliahu? You always had more than me and I was happy for you. The coat she bought in New York for $100, 3 years after she wore it every single day, she wanted to sell it to me for $150. She would've given it to a stranger but no, she wanted to insult me, to say she hates me. Why? Why? For no reason. Just like that. I don't love you anymore. I don't love anyone. Why do I have to love you? Why? Because you're my brothers? Is it a law? And what if I don't love you anymore? What will I do then? Simona, don't talk like that, it's not nice. -You shut up. How many times did you come to me and ask for help to tide you over? Okay, shut up, shut up. There's only so much we can listen to. You also turned your nose up at us with all your money. There's no more money. No more! Don't make yourself out to be poor. Micha provided for you for life. You lack for nothing. -That's what you think. You're doing Maurice an injustice. How did Micha get started if not with Maurice's help? You forget. You've all forgotten. And Micha repaid him with compound interest. Simona, he didn't get the business as a gift. He paid 100,000 NIS for it. He paid you until it folded. Did you expect him to keep paying you out of his own pocket after the business failed? He was up to his neck in debt, tell her. If Ben Lulu hadn?t offered Maurice to work with him we would have nothing to eat. Shame on you. All of a sudden you do know about Maurice's business affairs. You... you killed my brother. With your demands, your requests, your shopping. You were never satisfied. Nothing was enough. You wanted more and more until he collapsed. Shut up! Don?t talk like that about my mother. You shut up. Who do you think raised you? Who wiped your ass? Your mother? I did everything in this house while she sat with her legs crossed. For years I waited on her, like a maid, for no money. Out of my house! Get her out of my house! Get out! -Mother... Haim, Meir, David, get her out of here. Ilana, calm down, enough. Therese, bring her a glass of water. Enough! You've gone too far! I'll go... I'll sit at home. I'll mourn him in my house. You're not leaving here. -Don't tell her what to do. She'll do as she pleases. -You have a mouth, huh? Who asked you? Show some respect for your family. Look who's talking. You're one to talk about respect. If you had a bit of respect for your family, you wouldn?t want to take the two shops from your brother's widow. Do I want them for myself? It's for Haim. For the plant. To help Haim. You want to sell the shops? Did I ask you for anything? The shops aren?t even ours. You think I would take Maurice's shops from Ilana? I don't want anything from you! Let everyone look after himself. -Until now you took care of them. Why shouldn?t they take care of you now? -Ita, keep quiet. It's my money, I have the right to talk. It's my family's money. Okay, that's why you were in charge but they worked and were paid a salary. Therese, you can't buy a house in 3 years on an employee's salary, and go abroad twice a year. Honey, I broke 2 savings programs to build my house. Don't make me laugh. The reparations my mother got from Germany paid for this factory. Okay, but you did what you wanted to with your money. No one asked, no one forced you. She's right. You're right. It was our decision and our responsibility. It was yours, Haim. It's your responsibility. You're forgetting where you were before... you're forgetting. Your brother came, raised you, opened a plant for the family. Look at you, three years later. Ita, with all due respect, Haim opened the plant for himself because he wanted to, and not for anyone else. Excuse me, just a minute, you think you don't have to help now when the plant is failing? Help your brother the way he... helped you? What do you know, Ita? Why do you always think you know everything? We discussed it amongst ourselves and made some decisions. I'm selling my house, okay? And I suggest we stop talking about this now, it's really not the place. Is anyone else selling their house? I'm selling my house. Anyone else? Therese, are you selling? Are you selling? Lilly? Jacques? -Ruthie... Are you selling? -Calm down, okay? We don't need you to add to all this now. I'm not selling my house, okay? I'm not selling my house. You see, Itamar? They know how to look after their families. -Ruthie, enough. No, not enough. -Stop it, Ruthie, stop it. Don?t worry, I won't let you sell the house. I won't let anyone here sell their house. No one has to worry. Ita, Ita, Ita! I've already lost my money. But I won't let you take my uncle's reparations. They're losing a house, he lost his whole family in Germany. This is all he has left. -Ita, please... He did you a favor. He loaned you the money. And you have to pay him back every last cent! It's only money, Ita, only money. Only money? Look at you. Only money... I'll pay it back, Ita. -Where will you get the money? From the houses you mortgaged without telling me? From your brothers? From the failing plant? How will you pay him back? Everything will be okay, my sweet. Please, calm down. Calm down. Leave me alone! -Ita! Ita! Look, Itamar is selling his house to save his brother. You're the eldest, Meir. You should set an example. Why are you laughing? Why are you laughing? If you had acted like the eldest you would have taken the responsibility from Maurice and then maybe things would have been easier for him. What do you want from me? Therese, they want to kill me. Maurice always had more than me, so he took things into his own hands. I didn't mind. You always showed him respect and ignored me. Even Dad, God rest his soul. Dad never raised his hand. Did I ever raise my hand for no reason? It was to educate! I hit you because I loved you. Everything I did, I did for your own good. You were my little brothers... Happy now? Shame on you. This is the respect you show your brother? If you had any honor, you would give something of what you have to Haim. Look at David. He has nothing and he's giving. He is honorable. First become a father. Then talk to me about honor. -Shut up... Charlie! Charlie! Jacques, leave him alone. Go away... Hold him, Itmar. -Stop it, already. Stop it. Enough, enough! What's wrong with you? Did I ask for anything? Did I? I don?t want anything from you. I don?t want anything, God forbid, what's the matter with you? Is this any way to behave? What was in the past is dead. What I gave, I gave out of love. That's it, it's finished. I don't want anything from you. Nothing. You should be ashamed of yourselves. I hate you. It's all your fault. Why did you have to open your mouth? Ilana, where are you going? I'm going to my room and as far as I'm concerned, you can all go home. That's no way to talk, Ilana. What... is that the siren? -Quiet. The siren! The siren! -Mother, mother! Mother! Where's my mask? Hurry, hurry, hurry. Don't be scared, don't be scared. -Mother, where'd you put your mask? Itamar! Itamar! Open up! What can I say? Some vacation you arranged for me. You can't stay here, Ilana. There are people downstairs. I don't want to come down. They're asking for you. What should we say? -Whatever you want. What's wrong? Is everything all right? Ilana, what's wrong, sweetie? -I'm not coming downstairs. Why, Ilana? -Leave her alone, David. I want Simona to leave my house. What do you mean, "my house"? There's no "my house" now. You'll get your house back when the week of mourning ends. I won't sit in the same room with Simona. -You have no choice. What will you do? Force me? Drag me down the stairs? Leave her alone, she'll calm down and she'll come downstairs. I won't calm down and I won't come down. -Ilana, poor Simona, What do you want from her? She meant no harm. You know her. -She meant every word. And so did you. I know you think exactly like Simona. that I killed Maurice with my demands. Right? That's what you think. -God forbid. Who said that? Heaven forbid. Who ever said that? Don't think about it. It was a slip of the tongue on Simona's part. Don't think about it. Okay, okay, I'll come down. I'll honor the guests. And at night I'll sleep in my room and nobody dare say a word. That's the respect you're showing Maurice? How dare you talk to me about respect? Enough, leave her. Let everyone do whatever they want and that's it. Ben Lulu... Would you like something to eat? -Yes, if you have anything. Yes, there's rice with... peas on the stove. You're not at work today? -I had to come. How are they? Not great. And you, Vivian? How are you? I'm fine. Good... I'm going to them. Do you want something to eat? I can't take it anymore... I can't carry on. I can't... Lilly... I can't stay in this house any longer. Hi, Ilana. Do you need anything? I'd love a cup of coffee, thanks. Sugar? -Two teaspoons.. He loved to sit here every morning. We would drink coffee together... How are the boys? Holed up in their rooms. -Yes. I have to go. I have to go too. The children are waiting for me. Lilly... Maurice didn't love you. Why do you say that? Because I know. Simona... Do you want? No. Vivian... Are you all right? Yes. Simona... I love you. Why? Because you're my sister. Mother... What's wrong? Mother. Do you want something? What's wrong with you? Huh? Mother? If only you were here... If only the phone would ring, I'd answer, my son, and hear your voice. Who will look after me? Who will ask me is there and news, Mom? "Shiva" Seven Days
