Your Excellency, sir, with all due respect, the army is holding forth. It is time the air force roll outs and take this enemy out. Sir, be mindful that these people have held our people hostage. Do we use them as you mentioned? What do you suggest we do now? They are taking over territories, and that is not acceptable. Your Excellency, sir, we will deploy more troops and embark on intelligence gathering. Mr. President, sir, our intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance platform will point the army to the location. Meanwhile, we will carry out sort of strikes to pave the way for the ground troops to come in and recover those territories. Whatever information from our end will be shared with you all for a more coordinated operation. Well, in that case, what are we waiting for? You have my approval. Let's go and get them. Here. Thanks.

This is good news. I love you, too. If it's a boy, you will name him after me. That's my first son. Why should I name him after you? Because I'm your friend. What you need to do is get married, huh? It doesn't kill. We're not doing this again. I'm not ready. Don't you stop me. I'm naming my first son after you. The army has repelled an attack on Bama Village. Reports indicates that 40 insurgents were killed in their field attacks while one soldier sustained some injuries. The President commends the efforts of the armed forces, especially the coordinated strikes by the Air Force, which has led to the recovery of territories. He further assures the nation of his commitment to the total elimination of threat to lives and properties of the citizens in the Northeast and the nation. In other news, food and medical supplies to the IDP camp by the Nigerian Air Force has continued. Yes, we are glad that our efforts at winning the hearts and the minds of the communities ravaged by the insurgents yielded some results. As you are aware, we have conducted several surgeries on the IDPs. There was the case of this woman who was completely blind. She has had her own eyes completely restored now. So we'll keep fighting to restore peace in the communities. And as we do that, we will try as much as possible to improve the daily living conditions now that they are IDPs. These guys will be back, though. We won't either. That's okay. What up, P? No, no. Easy with it. I did. Mission accomplished. Yeah. We've managed to clear the area, although we're still keeping an eye on it. You know, the way these guys think baffles me. Who exactly are they fighting? Everyone who is not in support of their business or ideology is an enemy. Guys, you need to go and see the women and children suffering the brunt of this. You know, you need to get on the ground and see what's going on. It's a mess. It's tragic. Big mess. Morning, officer. Hey, stop here. Wait, wait, wait. You don't know this guy. That guy were doctors from headquarters - My mom, is she okay? Go. What happened to her? General, hold on, last card. Big two, jack up. Hey! Oh, sorry. Hello. How's my angle doing with my seed? Very well, sweet. Honey, I couldn't get a pass. We're still here on standby. Oh, no, no. Come on, honey, don't start. Well, you know I have seniors here who are married, too. Well, I just stopped at market to buy ingredients for your favorite soup, because you promised to come. Oh, sweetie, sweetie, sweetie. You know how the job is. You know what? I'll be back before you know it, okay? Make sure you keep that soup. Make sure you keep my soup, huh? Nothing in the world is going to stop me from eating it. I promise. You promise again, every time. I love you. I love you more. Sir. Good morning, gentlemen. Sit down. The enemy is still out there. And you wonder why we're always calling you for this kind of mission.

However, the Chief of the Air Staff has assured Nigerians that he will do whatever it takes to recover the down pilot. During the operation, the rescue team came under fire from the insurgents. Scores of the insurgents were killed and one soldier sustained gunshot wounds. Calm down. Hmm. Calm down. Yes, come in. No, no, no. Oh, my God, no. Oh, my God, no. No, no, no. No, no, no. Mama, no. Mama. No, no, no, no. No, Mama. Mama. Mama, no. Mama, no. Mama. We're here on behalf of the Chief of the Air Staff and all the personnel of Air Task Force, to commiserate with you on the loss of your beloved husband, the son and the father. My gallant brother warrior, who paid a supreme price in service to our fatherland. Joseph's sacrifice will not be in vain. We shall defeat the enemy and restore peace to all the troubled areas. The entire Air Force family stands with you in this painful moment. We must assure that the Air Force will take care of your daughter's education. In the meantime, please accept this token for immediate expenses. Thank you, sir. As we prepare to honor our fallen hero. Shh. Listen, I'm not going to harm you, okay? I'm gonna take my hand of you. Look, I'm a pilot, okay? I fly flights, flights. Fighter pilot. I fly jets, okay? I know exactly who a pilot is. And I also know exactly what a fighter pilot does. Great. You kill people. Hey, hey. I'm a Nigerian Air Force officer, a pilot. Look, we are fighting for you. Please, can I, can I get some water to drink? Just wait here. I... He's asking how you got here. I just lost my jet. A long day and I missed front line. Wait, you can actually understand what he's saying. Just a bit. Around here. I'm right here. So the moment I got back on my feet, I have to run in the opposite direction, and that's how I find myself in this settlement. That... that's why the government is trying to help you. I just lost my jet. My jet just crashed. I put my life on the line for you. I have a pregnant wife at home, probably worried sick about... about my whereabouts now. I can bet you that the Air Force is doing everything in its power to rescue me from this situation. And the government is doing everything to restore peace to your communities. So please no, my brother. No, I do not agree with you. Gentlemen. How is the morale? High, sir. Good. This is not a drill. This is a mission to search, find and recover Wing Commodore Nura Yusuf. That one soul is the blood of the nation. His survival is key to our struggle. You'll be deployed in that area and you're expected to do everything possible to get the desired result. The Chief of the Air Staff is counting on you. Our families are counting on you. The mission is counting on you. Gentleman, how is the morale? High, sir! Your commander will take it from here. I request your permission to carry on, sir. Carry on. Easy. It's nothing new. We've done it before. We can do it again. I know you're the best. You know you're we're the best. They know we're the best. Right. So, let's move out and fight like... Stand by. I believe Nura is alive. Yeah. My instinct tells me he has gone far away from the aircraft as a survival tactic, because the area is a visible target. Yeah, because he actually crashed in enemy's territory. Exactly. You know, maybe that's why we couldn't find him in the first instance. Because he must be running away from the enemy. Yeah. I suggest you search in the opposite direction. The ISR unit guys need this information also. Meanwhile, I need to call his home. - Yeah. - Yeah. Hello, madam. I'm... I'm calling to reassure you of our commitment to bring our friend and classmate back home. Yissa, if he's dead, just tell me. I know him to be a survivor. Yes. I don't want you to lose hope. Paul Dike is leading a special operation force, and I'll be in the air. Yeah. Hold the line. He wants to talk to you. Hello, madam. How are you doing? Good afternoon. Listen, you know he has every reason to stay alive. All right. Just keep him in your prayers and stay positive. Okay, I will. Listen, Nigerian Air Force is mobilizing everything. And I started an operation for recovery. Yissa and I are here, and we're committed to bringing our colleague home. Thank you, Paul. She's complaining. Why are you complaining? Boys! Oh. The food is getting cold. Yes. But we can't just stand here and wait for them to come and attack us. At least, we have to find a way to defend ourselves if they come. We're assured the good or the bad will come any time. Before reinforcements comes and this will be sure that we can defend ourselves. That means we're together with you. Okay. All right, guys. Check equipment. Check ammo. Ammo, check. Check medics. Cool. Check communications. All right. This is it. Gentlemen, we're going to hang out here for the night. And then tomorrow morning, we set out at 0500. We're going to search and find out. Save your energy. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. Let's go. General. Better come out. Or else I will kill each soldier you swore to protect. Shh! It's me they want. I have to go out there or they'll kill her. But, shh, let none of you come out until you hear the sound of the aircraft, okay? Shadow, coming from Panther. Shadow, this is Panther. Do you read me? Panther, Panther, coming in from Shadow. We just had gunshots north of our advance position. I repeat, we just heard gunshots north of our advance positions. Do you copy? Copy. Bravo out. I'm going out there. Look. They know I'm here, and they'll find us sooner than later. I don't want anyone else killed for my sake. One! Go back, go back. Two. Nura! Good. Gentlemen, prepare for evacuation immediately. Roger. Over. Morning, sir. Morning. Any news? Yes, sir. I'm happy to report that we have found the pilot, sir. Uh, uh, and what's the situation? The asset is alive and well, sir. Oh, great. The... the... the chief will be so happy to hear this. I'm sure he will, sir. They should recover to base immediately, okay? Will do, sir. No, no, no, no! The mission is to recover you. They're gonna deny. Let me speak to the commander. Listen, your pregnant wife is waiting and worried. All right, let's go now. We took an oath to protect this nation and our people with our lives. These are the people. Don't forget your training. The commander ordered an evacuation and that's it, all right? Listen, I made a promise that we're going to bring you home. I want to see my wife, all right. But first, I have more to serve. You serve with my life. That's why we stand here, that's why we stand together. Let me speak to the commander. Wing Commander, are you floating my orders? No, sir. We respect you. Make me understand. That is 60 seconds. I came in contact with a young man, fully armed. What? Sir, I think he's trying to send a message and also a young lady from the community was abducted by these insurgents, sir. That singular gesture shows that he's an ally. He and Amina must be rescued from the jaws of those insurgents. And that's an order setup. Copied, sir. And our special forces, our trained forces kind of mission. Also, make the best use of them. All right, gentlemen, the mission has changed. Secure the village and wait for your next instruction. So how does it feel like to eat some dust for a change? Just an elite pilot. I feel that could've been worse. Easy. We'll do something for these eyes, man. Panther, Panther, coming from Shadow. This is Panther. You are loud, send. Again, Panther, Panther, coming from Shadow. This is Panther, you're loud. Send. It's almost a flush. I want to look to see where it was. Roger, standing by. Panther, Panther, from Shadow, check back. Shadow, you're loud. This is Panther, send. Panther, Panther, from Shadow. This is Panther, you're loud, send. I have the location of the insurgents. I say again, I have the location of the insurgents, is at grid reference, 243-546. I say again, is at grid reference, 243-546. 243,546. Roger that. Woody, bring them map. There we are. There we are. It's been five days since the Nigerian Air Force has continued to search for the missing pilot. Amidst all other operations still ongoing in the Northeast, the medical outreach has continued. The Chief of the Air Staff was in hand to see the progress and has this to say. Yes, so in the course of our operations, a lot of people become displaced from their homes. So as we fight to protect them, we also try as much as possible to make their living conditions as comfortable as possible by catering to their daily needs and the medical care. We call this winning the hearts and the minds of the locals, beyond bombs and bullets. When asked about the fate of the pilot... I don't... My boys are on top of that. We'll find him and bring him home. All I hear is they'll bring him back. When? No, I'll come with you. No, no, no. You've already done enough. All right, sir. You're not a fighter. I'm a soldier. Give the man a weapon. Yes, sir. Let's go. Go, go, go! Go, go, go, go, go, go. He sees you. He went back inside. The young man I told you that seen me and the girls and the community is the one that released these girls. I asked him to come with me, but he said you're going to shoot him. No, no, sir. Baku went back inside, he said he has unfinished business with his commander. There are a lot of people in there, sir. Send your guys in. Hey! I'm not afraid to die and you know it. I'm not afraid to die and you know it. Let him go. We're both the same right now. We're both murderers. Give me a free passage and I will let this boy go alive. Let him go first and I'll let you go. You must take me for a fool. Don't he know the meaning of safe passage, huh? Look, I don't care. I could kill both of you. But it's a better option if you let him go first and then I'll let you go. I need to get to this. I know that. I know you want him desperately. Is that how you want to play it? Is that how you want it? Please, sir. Please don't kill him. Please. Please. I can see someone is in love. Amina. Amina, go back. You betrayed me. Search him, search him. Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go. Let's go. Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go. Let's go. Paul Dike led the team. Mm-hmm. Well done. Thank you, sir. Welcome back. Yes, sir. Welcome back. Thank you, sir. Where's the young man that spared your life? Bring Baku. Here, sir. Young man, I want to assure you that government is doing all it can to restore peace to our communities. Thank you very much. Thank you very much for your change of heart. No, sir. I should thank you for saving my mother and giving her a chance to see again, sir. The medical team in Dalori, my sister and my mother are there, sir. See, together, we will defeat the enemy, hmm? Yes, sir. In other news, the Northeast has been relatively calm from the activities of the insurgents. Now, commendations have been pouring in from the international communities on the successes of the armed forces of Nigeria. The Nigerian president has acknowledged the efforts of the Nigerian Air Force in the restoration of peace in the region and synergy between the forces was vital in the restoration of the peace. If not for the time they showed up, it was so timely, what was about to unfold in that village would have been... it would have been a different story today, I swear. - What'd I get? - Is that why I'm here? My friend, I'm a married man. Go and marry. I'm responsible. Go to the mess. Um, I'm okay. That is ready. I think you should come serve yourselves. Aha, madam. I promised I will bring your husband back home, and I did. Hear you say that nonsense, nonsense. Hey, you both, you both rescued me. Hey, look, I appreciate you both equally. We what? We fall and we rise together, right? - Right. - Yeah, we rise. Even better, we rise and rise. Yeah. Keep rising, yes. No, thank you both for saving him. Oh, you don't have to mention. And in all of this appreciation and thanks, there's one person of whom without I wouldn't be standing here with my beautiful wife, probably would have had a bullet in my head long ago. Who is that? You're so quick to forget the boy from the village, Baku. Oh! Oh, yeah. Baku, Baku, yeah. Well, I still hope he shows up. Oh, you invited him? Oh, guess who is here. Speak about the devil. Look. Baku. Yes. Look at you, looking all different and clean. You cut your hair. Good afternoon. Hi, sir. Wow. I tell you. Officers, meet my mother. Oh, it was you with the sight problem. Oh, good to meet you, Ma. Welcome to our home. Wow. Very nice to meet you. Nice meeting you. And one more special person who is no stranger to you. Well, to some of you, you may have heard about her. Ooh! Wait. What? Amina? Yes, sir. Whoa, you remember her? Oh, my God. Whoa! You remember her? She looks different in the city. Wow. Good. Amina, the lady that's given me so much reason to live. I can see that. Now that peace has been restored to our community, we are going back to rebuild our homes and raise a family. Raise, what? - Both of you. - Yes. You see your lives. Look at you. Look at you. Look at this little boy. Look. Look. Congratulations. Congratulations, Baku. Good. Good. Wow. Wow! You guys are all welcome to visit anytime. Of course, anytime. At least, this time we'll not be dropping from the sky.
