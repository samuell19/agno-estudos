Hey Ryan, you got (mumbles) (fire burning) (mumbles) (coughing loudly) So this is what the outside looks like. After being locked inside now I realized that I wasn't really locked inside I was only locked inside of my own mind. My own mind. So this is what outside looks like, beautiful. Right, birds are singing, feels good. Just let the light reflect in my skin. All this time I thought it was the house, I thought the house had me locked in. But I was only locked in within my own self. I always knew was something evil about this house, always. I guess Bill had a point, "Stay the fuck away from the house." (upbeat music)
