God, You are The One and Only God, You are The Eternal, The Absolute Other than You, I have no one No other sanctuary I have no one other than You to turn to I have no one other than You to turn to God, You are my only source of support You are The Most Merciful Glory be to You, God who has not given birth And has not been born Also, as soon as you get a response from the actress, let me know. How long until the lighting is set up? -10 minutes, hopefully. -Okay. Randa, I need it to be ready in five minutes. The actress who was supposed to play the mother has quit over hijab. -Deal with it. -Ok. Can't you play the mother yourself? What can I do? Can no actress in the whole country play the mother? -Why don't you have a substitute? -I did, but she cancelled when she knew that she'll do the ad without a hijab. -Didn't she attend the casting hijab-free? -I know. I can play the mother. Shall we get ready so we can start as soon as the substitute arrives? There's another one, but she demands extra money. -Can she act well? -Yes. -What's her name? -Suad. Isn't she the one who just backed out? -I think so. -When does she get here? She should be here any minute. Okay. Let's get started on blocking. -That's enough. -Just making sure it works. -I'm here. -Hello. -The mother is here. -Peace be upon you. And may upon you be peace. -How are you, lovelies? -Here you go, this is your seat. Where's the script? Or is it a simple ad without a script? This ad is about a family eating and having tea around the table. -They don't say anything. -They still make ads like this? That's what the client wants. Excuse me, we're about to start filming. Hello. Yes. Just a minute. How long will this take? -We haven't even started yet. -About half an hour. -There's another scene following this. -Well, almost an hour. -No phone calls, please. We're shooting. -Okay. Thank you. Come on. -Is it all set? -Yes. Omar, there's a cop outside. Cut. Take the memory cards out of the camera. Hamza, take out the memory cards. -Peace be upon you. -And may upon you be peace and His mercy. -What's going on here? -What's the problem? We're filming an ad. Show me your advertisement permit. Here. Show me your ID. Here. -Are you Omar? -Yes. -Come with me to the station. -Why, brother? You have all the documents. -You can say that in the station. -Why? What's the problem? Neighbors filed a complaint against you due to presence of women without hijabs. Where are the women without hijabs? Here they are, all wearing hijabs. Are you coming with me or what? Listen, we're all from honorable families and we've done nothing wrong. We're going to resume filming and you can take it as you like. Come with me or, I'll have to use force. If you're a real man, try me. Come on in. Let him in. -Peace be upon you. -And may upon you be peace. Have a seat. -I'll give you privacy. -Thank you. You look a lot worse than you did the last time I saw you. Were you willing to assault the cop, Omar? Good thing I caught you before you became a felon. We had all the permits. He had no right to arrest me like I'm a criminal. On top of that, he was abusive to us. Also, I didn't even ask you to come. If it hadn't been for your mother and her will, I wouldn't have come here. If you're not okay with me being here, I'll let them take you back down there. Enough foolishness. You're free to do what you wish, just keep us out of trouble. -That's the outcome of your silly films. -We're not being silly, we're working. The cop is coming here. You'll apologize to him so I can bail you out. Also, as I've already said, that idea of yours will never work. Thank you very much. Please apologize to the cop. It's all good. Anyway, the cop understands and accepts your apology. I hope this situation never happens again. Understood? -Very good. -You need to sign this undertaking. Here. Be careful. When practicing your rights, remember that our country has order. Got it? Here's your ID. I want to quit the advertising field. Why? I can no longer take this nonsense. I may be condemned even for socialization. Do I have to tolerate him, or the client's strange demands, or you? What about money? I couldn't care less. Find someone else. Why are you acting like such a sissy? -I'm serious. -Omar, we've taken falls harder than this. We always take them lightly, stand back up, and find success again. Find your success. Is there a difference? We're partners in all of this. What? I've wanted to make my own film for two years, but you're opposed. I'm not, but we're not ready, and the circumstances are unfit. Give it time. How do you expect me to work when I already have so much on my plate? I swear to you. As soon as the conditions are good, I'll be your biggest supporter. You just need to be patient. It's coming. Look at this. The dramatic lady is here. -Peace be upon you. -And may upon you be peace. Congratulations on getting out, Omar. -Welcome back. -Thank you. -How are you, Muhannad? -Fine. -And you? -Well, thankfully. Would you take this stubborn man, feed him, and return him in a good mood? -We have an important meeting. -No, I'm not coming. -You go and I'll deal with him. -That'll work too. -What's your problem? -I'm not attending the meeting. I mean with Lina. Are you separated? No, we're back together. Okay, listen. Those people aren't demanding. All you have to do is come up with an idea about the way of living in the old days. That's all. You'll get whatever you want. No, dear. I know that kind of people well. As soon as I start with the story outline, writing the cinematic review, and such, they interfere with my work and ask me to cut something and add another. -Then they say, "Delete this scene." -How about you go have dinner, and come back in a good mood, please? Get up. We have an important meeting. What a great kind of people that I have to work with! -I'm glad you're safe. -Thank you. Tell me, what happened? Someone reported us, so the cops came. Didn't you have a permit? We did, but we had an argument and I ended up at the station. Get up. I brought you some food. -I don't want any. -Yes! Are you bulimic or something? I haven't eaten since you were jailed. Not a single bite. And you, you're eating. It's not up to you. Here. I've missed you. You've become even prettier. -Ignore that idiot. -I don't mind her. Come on now. Where to? Don't tell me you're leaving so early. -I have a really important meeting. -Just stay a bit longer. I only came to check on you. What are you doing tonight? I might go to bed early. Alright. If you don't, I'll be at Brew92. Join me. -Okay, I'll come if I'm not tired. -Be there, and stop this foolishness. Please convince him. Goodbye. -Take my place. -I'll go. I will. Are you going to attend the meeting with Muhannad? No, spare me that burden. The client is about to arrive. Be ready. -Seriously, I'm not coming. -Cut this out. Come on, my office. -Was it smooth getting here? -Yes. -After you. -Thank you. -How is everyone? -Fine, thankfully. Glad to hear it. No! Not now! Lina seemed pissed off. -Did she tell you anything? -No, but it seemed like it. You must've seen the video we've made about the old Jeddah. Yes, and that's the reason we chose to visit you. It's the work of our Hollywood director, Omar. Well, I thought you directed it yourself. -No, I was the creative director. -Very good. -Okayâ€¦ -You'll give Muhannad a heart attack. Let him handle it. I can't believe he got my father to go to the station. He's only good with words. "Come here, try our organic coffee from Brazil and Colombia." Let him take it. -What do you think of the coffee? -It's truly delightful. It's a Brazilian variety named Catuai, and it's different from normal coffee. It's the only sort of Brazilian coffee that can offer you such an intense taste. Great. Now, you know exactly what we need. -True. -You know the deadline too. Everything will be ready by the end of this month. Let's hope so. Also, maybe Omar can join us next time. Of course, hopefully. -Okay, thank you very much. -Thank you. -Please stay seated. -No, I was leaving anyway. Okay, very well. -Aren't they gone yet? -Yes, they are. -Then why leave me crammed in here? -I thought you were comfortable. Goodbye then. Bye. -Dude, where have you been? -How are you, Ahmed? Fine, thankfully. Nada has been looking for you. Where were you? It's no big deal, don't worry. I saw Lina in the corner on my way in. Alright, bro. I'll talk to her and be right back. Means iessentia. -Is it an Arabic word? -No, it's Greek. But you're pronouncing it as if it's Arabic. Everything we say is Arabic anyway. It's not like we speak French. -I don't know. -I'll note it down so it doesn't slip. Omar! Meet Ali al-Sharif. -Hello. -How are you? I'm honored to meet you. Honor is mine. We're thrilled to have you. Omar is a film and ad director. Ali is a bartender and music producer. Jack of all trades. Please have a seat. Would you like a drink? -No, thank you. -Of course. I've badgered Lina to bring you along because I was sure you'd like it here. There, she did. So, I'll be expecting your call on Monday, and hopefully, we'll meet again. -Please take care of it. -Don't worry. See you, dude. As soon as Hana told me you were at the station, I dropped everything and left the studio to call her, but she didn't answer. I also called Samir and your sister to no avail. I almost called Uncle Nidal. So terrifying! Your father had to be left out of it. You know, if you got into acting, you'd have a huge break. What's wrong with you? Don't you know what's wrong with me? No, or I wouldn't have asked you. It's nothing. What's going on, Omar? What have I done? -I can't talk right now. -Okay, but I need to know. I'm not in the mood for this. I can't rest assured until I know what's going on. If it bothered you to see Ali, then stop being silly. Erase such weird thoughts from your mind. I love you and no one else. What's wrong? I'm free to feel angry, sad, or pissed off. Don't you think I like it when you're angry and pissed off? Really? You're good at this. Okay. Let's go to the beach. I'm sick of sitting here. Come on, let's lighten the mood. Let's go. Do you want a drink? -I want some balila. -Balila it is, then. As you wish. It's almost time for me to attend the course. When are you going? -In two weeks. -How long will you stay there? I told you, three months. -Isn't that too long? -None of their courses end any sooner. What even is the point of this course? Don't you remember when you told me that inspiration would strike with a new environment? Yes, but you never told me it'd take so long. I did, but you never listen to me. -I'm tired. -Of me? No, of walking. Turns out, it's a long trip. It's not that far. There it is. Wait, let's cross the road together. I'll beat you to it. -I'm tired. -Of me? Yes. I feel like we need a break. I'm emotionally overwhelmed. I need to see new people, experience a new environment. Also, there's so much we don't agree on. What do you mean by that? And how long have you felt that way? Or did you wake up today feeling bored? I never said I was bored. All I'm saying is that we need time apartâ€¦ until we figure out a way to make this work. Omar, I'm confused because none of us is at their best. Even you can make use of this. If you're feeling confused, speak for yourself. I know exactly what I want and how I want to end up. Sorry. I'm confused, you're doing just fine. But I'm not saying this to tick you off, Omar. Why would I be ticked off? A couple breaking up, it happens all the time. I'm not asking for a breakup. Stop putting words in my mouth. We can keep in touch, just not on a daily basis. Thank you. And I thought you were breaking up with me. Man, people are weird! What's with the attitude? I'm being serious now. The driver's here. I have to go right now. Promise me to think about what I said and try to keep calm. Omar, I'm talking to you. I'll talk to you later. Are we still waiting for Omar? -Where is he right now? -There he is. Yes, that's his car. How could you find parking here? -Someone gave me their parking pass. -What a lucky man! Yet, you let me go through hell to bring you and Hala parking passes? Hala, when is our appointment with Lina? We have to be there at nine o'clock. Nine? Can't we delay it a little while? No, she'll accompany us from here to there. Let's finish our work here then we can go there. Okay. Why don't you buy us some juice to have during our trip? Maybe some melon juice. -Watermelon juice. -Maybe on the way back. Melon, watermelon, it doesn't matter as long as Omar pays. So, where would you like us to start? The client wants us to film the old Jeddah and the way people used to live in it. I don't have a specific idea, but I'll keep walking and exploring. Nice. If we keep walking that way, we'll reach the Mecca Gate. Okay, let's see. This is a beautiful location as well. There's also Zakaraia, The Carpenter's workshop. Young men used to gather there to hear his tales. Wonderful! Tell me about it. I used to go there when I worked on the documentary in Harat al-Madhloum. Did you make a documentary? -Didn't you know? -You've been wronged ever since I met you. Ignore him. It was right before I traveled. So, I never told you. I was heavily interested in Harat al-Madhloum. -I'd go there and hear the tales about it. -What's the deal with Harat al-Madhloum? Listen to this. A man named Abdulkareem Barzanji came into this square. He had escaped from the Turks or the Ashraf. He arrived at the neighborhood and started telling his story to its people. The people embraced him and helped him hide among them. -Beautiful. -After a while, someone snitched on him, then the navy arrived and arrested him. What navy? -The one of the old Ottoman army. -Okay. Allegedly, After he was captured, they cut his head off. His blood splattered on the wall and spelled "oppressed". -What a work of the imagination! -It is a legend, you ignoramus. What's the difference? A legend is important in the intellectual and cultural composition of a society. -You're the legend. -What's this? Stop it, boy! That's it, let him go. Isn't that your friend? -Why were you beating him up? -What were you two doing? -Peace be upon you. -And peace be upon you. -Let's play together. -I want one bowl of balila. Let's go. Where are the balls? Come on, hurry. Are the four of us playing? You were playing with two balls. So, what would this change? No. Keep playing. -No. Stop. -It's cheating. Ground is full of holes. The whole country is full of holes. So, why not the table too? Okay. All I'm saying, let's compare this area to a downtown area in Egypt. They have that man who serves pigeon meat. -Farhat. -Yes, Farhat. -He's great. -You'll have the best pigeon meat there. Same goes for Turkey. If you want to buy spices or anything, you can buy it downtown. That's not how it is here. Why not? Shukri, The Baker's shop has been there since forever. -People stand in line in front of it. -Yes, but he's the only one there. We don't stand out for anything, not jewelry shops or barber shops. Most of our goods are low-quality Chinese products. Wait. What I mean is that Jeddah has become spiritless. So, you want to get people to move back into this town and revive it? Where are we going? -Seriously? We've been following you. -Come on, then. -Thank you. -You're welcome. Thank you very much. I agree. Since you come here so frequently, you must've got so used to such appearances that you no longer find it interesting. If I opened a restaurant that served delicious mutabaq here, people would be standing in line trying to buy some. When you take a couple of steps in, it all feels so artificial. I enjoy coming to such neighborhoods, but I'm not willing to live here. Beautiful. That's what I'm saying. We bring people in here and tell them, "This is how we used to live." It's the same foolishness happening in festivals. What a master you are, Omar! I feel like we've wasted the scouting day we came here for. Let's eat first. The Filipino restaurant I found while arriving looked fantastic. -I'm not eating Filipino food, obviously. -Yes, you are. -You're surely eating Filipino cuisine. -Hala, I don't want anything Filipino. -Yes, you do. -None for me. I'll have anything, maybe a burger. -Burger? -Or mandi. -Where did he go? -I don't know. Lady, would you buy water from me? Thanks, but I don't want any. I pray that you marry this guy. Thank you, but I don't want to marry. Come here. No, Omar. They'll flock here. Where did you go? -Dude, you won't believe what I found. -What? What was it? Let's get back into the car. I'm sick of this extreme heat. -What is it? I want to see. -Come with me. -Come on. -Hurry up. -What did you find? -By coincidence, while walking in, I found this place. Thank you. HOUSE OF ANTIQUES It's an awesome place, dude. Peace be upon you. And peace be upon you. Welcome. May I take a look at the vinyl? Of course, go ahead. How much is this, Uncle? 3600 riyals. It's too expensive, Sir. FINAL PRICES NON-NEGOTIABLE Do you have an Umm Kulthum vinyl? -Which one? -Inta Omri. How amazing! Unfortunately not. But you might've heard her sing, Let this heart beat And burn in the flames of love Mahrus! What did you want, Uncle Farid? Thank you. Umm Kulthum's vinyl is on top of the blue box. -Next to Abd al-Wahhab's vinyl? -Yes. Bring it for me. You got it. -Do you think it's original? -Of course. Apparently, they found it. Here it is, Uncle Farid. -Yes. -Where are you? -Here's Rubayyiat el Khayyam. -Why? Are we meeting or not? No. Omar, please come. I'm busy. You should've let me know earlier. I've tried to contact you, but you never answered. You only tried twice, and I'm too special to be informed as if I'm someone else. Well, can I meet you before I depart? Omar. Omar! Okay. -Did you see that? -No. SUNG BY STAR OF THE EAST, UMM KULTHUM I feel a bit likeâ€¦ I kind of feel like this is a lie. -Hello. -I'm going to miss you. I'm the one who's going to miss you. I abandoned many important things so I could come and see you. How could you not come to see me? I would beat you both up. -I hope you arrive and return safely. -Thank you. -How are you? -Fine. -How's it going? -You're right on time. -Hey, big man. -What's up? I'm fine. You? How's work? Well, it's sort of wobbly. No cash flow. -Any cash flow? -Thankfully. You're going to miss Ali's coffee so much. How can you tolerate Giovanni's coffee? Don't bad-mouth Giovanni. Let me try it first. Come on. -Wonderful. -You're a true master. I know. -I'm really going to miss you. -Me too. See everyone here? I would've never sensed their presence without you. You'll all be lost without me. -You're right about that. -We'll totally feel lost without you. We'll even stop meeting together. Really? You're the first one we'll stop seeing. Yes, maybe not, but I'm going to miss you. Me too. I feel like even Omar will disappear. Listen, have you heard of the first Oscar-nominated Saudi film? Hundreds of films have been nominated, so why does it matter that it's Saudi? What are you talking about? You know? I feel like we've failed at cinema. Abroad, everything is internet-based now. I don't know why we're still struggling here. Because we haven't tried yet. We might be the ones to bring cinema back. You can't project Hollywood on us. For God's sake, Omar. Do you have more knowledge than Hollywood? Yes, more knowledge than Hollywood and you. That really upset you, it seems. You're taking it personally. I know that's your profession, butâ€¦ What does this have to do with me feeling upset? Ali means thatâ€¦ I know exactly what he means. No need to explain it to me. Also, I agree with what you said. Let each one of us mind his own profession. Do you want coffee? Ali, two coffees. You got it, bro, but you need to order downstairs. Anyway, I'll talk to the other guys downstairs. Don't you leave, okay? Also, count me in on the food. Just a barista acting like a philosopher. Where are you going? You're a mean, selfish, arrogant man. You think you're better than everyone else? Is that what you think? Yes, because you're good at nothing but undermining others. It's what you do. Are you done? Yes. Okay. What? You're here! You're here early. And looking like a hobo. Well, I never got back home. I've been here since yesterday. I'm trying to work on that damn ad and coming up with a concept for it. -Have you found one? -No. What are you lacking? I don't know. Is there a problem? No. There must be a problem. Working here has been pointless. I've worked here for two years and I still can't make an ad or a film. Seriously, though. What are you lacking? That's the problem. I don't know. How can someone work on something knowing that it'll turn out disastrous? Figure out your problem, solve it, and it won't end up being a disaster. Of course. I'll find out what it is. Just be patient. Why don't you go see that man from the antique shop? I mean the one downtown where we went to see vinyl. You're a true champ. What's with you? Where are you headed? I adore you. Okay. -Peace be upon you. -And peace and God's mercy be upon you. How are you, Uncle? -Welcome. -I visited you a while back. Remember me? Sorry, young man, I don't. He visited two days ago with two friends. They bought Umm Kulthum vinyl. Hello. Can I help you? Let me introduce myself. My name is Omar and I'm an ad and film director. God bless you. I'm currently working on a project about the old Jeddah. I could use your help if you have any photos or such material. I'll take a look for you. What's this book? Never seen it before. It's from the days of Muhammed Said Farsi, and people who can appreciate it. Yes, but it has nothing but photos of buildings. Do you have photos of ordinary people? Jeddah is a customary bride. It's hard to find a witness of her marriage. Listen. How about you come back tomorrow? I may find photos that suit your needs. Okay. He asked me to go back tomorrow so he can show me some photos. He seems interesting. Why are you feeling lost? I'm not. I just don't know if I'm doing the right thing. I really hope he gets me something useful. That's the definition of being lost. I would know, I've felt lost for years. Wonderful. Bring the cups and follow me. Soâ€¦ As I told Hala the other day, I feel like I'm pushing myself too hard, and I don't even know if I'm doing what's right. Especially after what happened with Lina. What do you mean? Aren't you exaggerating when it comes to Lina? It is what happened. Did you break up? We haven't talked ever since our fight. -How's the sugar in your coffee? -I need some. I thought so. Stay here. Speak. I'm listening. I get that she's upset, but her behavior was unnerving. What do you mean it was unnerving? What's the matter? Weren't you there when it happened? Come on, man. Don't you see that you refuse to compromise even a little? Also, since when are you the Saudi man who feels jealous for his wives? It's not like that. She's been talking about breaking up and starting trouble over everything. She was never like that. She used to be a sweet princess. Sweet, indeed. -Relax. -I didn't mean anything. What's your plan? I don't know? Speaking of honey, tell me you've got the toilet fixed. Yes, I did. -Please, don't give me trouble. -Press it well when you're done. Peace be upon you. Uncle Farid? -Welcome. -I wanted to see Uncle Farid. He's not here right now, but you can come in and take a seat. He'll be here very soon. -Goodbye, my friend. -Goodbye. Goodbye. -How long have you been here? -About an hour. Come with me. Close the door behind you. Check on the left of the books. You might find what you need. -Have you found anything? -Not yet. Here are all the photos I have. Okay, this one first. Then this one, then this. What are you doing? I'm trying to make this ad out of photos only. Using the chrono-photography technique? -Exactly. -I'm glad you're satisfied with them. What exactly do you do? The answer would take a whole day. -Which ones do you want? -I want them all. Okay, then. By the name of God. Give them to me. God bless you. Did you use to work in filmmaking? You can say that. Why are you asking? Because inside, I found film posters and a reel with your name on it. -Amante Spirito? -Are you the director? Yes, I filmed it. Well, I want to know more. Have you done any more films? Also, why haven't I heard of you? Or have you quit the cinema industry? That was in the past. I no longer do. But what I saw inspired me and gave me ideas for the film I want to make. Do you want to work on films or ads? I'm working on an ad right now, but I want to make a film. What kind of film? I want to touch upon Jeddah, the way Youssef Chahine used to touch upon Alexandria in his films. Jeddah is such an exotic place. Hence, we need to make a film where the world can see the real Jeddah. What's real about Jeddah? Where's the reality? Death is a reality, and so are injustice and corruption. But art is a set of fictional images. It was never a reality. Are you tired of carrying them? Should I take the load off? No, thanks. Are we gonna lock this deal or what? Just serve them your exquisite coffee and don't worry about anything else. Listen. See these photos? I found them at the shop of a '70s cinematographer. -Beautiful. -What do you mean? Weren't you listening? I said I'd found them with someone that you have to meet. Listen, the gentlemen are almost here. So, aren't you done? Okay, I'll be there. That's where the product comes in. People would use it in such gatherings. So, it was people who created al-Zuhur tea and developed the association of the product with warmth and friendship. So, through this ad, we'll try to remember how the society that came up with the product revived this concept once again. Thank you. In fact, you did an amazing job artistically. But I have some notes I'd like to share. First of all, what you came up with is more significant than what we expected. I understand, but we thought we'd make something big to fit your company. Let me finish. I'm not done. Secondly, I don't see how what you've delivered conveys what we're going for. -Marketing-wiseâ€¦ -Excuse me, Mr. Nadim. Our ad is not directly about the product. Al-Zuhur tea is already well-known. It talks about the history behind this tea brand, not the tea itself. That's what I could understand. Apparently, it was misexplained to you. As a marketing firm, we expect everything to have commercial value. The ad must be about the tea itself, as a product. Omar means that we're going for a less blatantly commercial ad. That's not what I'm trying to say. People are sick of seeing tea being poured in slow motion and delightfully enjoyed. We're covering the people who've come up with the tea. I'm not a historian. I'm here to sell the tea, not the people. So, whatever we expect must have marketing value. Also, I'm not here to learn from you how to promote the tea of my company. You obviously know what you want. I just don't see what you see. Would you give me a minute? Have you lost your mind? He's a jerk. Couldn't you see what an idiot he was being? He knows we're doing what's right, but he's obviously ignorant and clueless. We tolerate you for being a true artist, but that idiot you're speaking of is the one paying our bills, after all. To hell with any money coming from someone like him. Why are you upset right now? We had a deal. I find the concept, you try to sell it to him. But apparently, you're clueless too. Stop this nonsense! You think you're the only bright one here? All you do is talk trash. I'm the one working hard to keep this company afloat. You just fool around like you're the only director there is. You're right. I'm leaving. See this through by yourself. Stop this, Omar. This is not the first time. We can talk to him again. This is not an appropriate behavior. -Omar. -Please leave me alone. It's not your problem alone. If you decide to leave, I'm leaving too. Why do you insist on advising me? I'm an idiot, okay? Fix your own miserable lives before judging me. Don't you feel like you've taken too much time? I thought you were exaggerating, but your depression doesn't seem to end. Get up and let's go. I don't feel like it. Come on, let's take a walk and get coffee. Everyone has missed you. Let's go to the gallery. Lina is displaying her photos there. Everyone has gone there. Listen, I'm in a bad mood. If I go, I'll be a buzzkill to everyone. I'm depressed, and I need to think everything through. Don't worry, I'm not committing suicide. Suicide? Okay, I'll leave you alone. -Do you need anything? -Do you have 500 riyals? Here, keep this money. -It's too much. -Just keep it. You'll call me, right? I'll be waiting. Don't be late. Goodbye. Surprise! How are you? -Happy birthday! -Thank you. How are you, Laila? Welcome. -How are you? -Fine. Omar, where did you get this? ALEXANDRIAâ€¦ WHY? Salim got it for me from Egypt. I've told you many times. Let me know before you buy such things. You have Salim's number. Call him. -What a mess you live in! -I didn't know you were coming. Would you be cleaning for us or for yourself? -Do you want to drink anything? -Bring me some water. This is quite unbearable. How can you live like this? With difficulty. Omar, bring plates for the cake. Even the table is nasty. Deal with it. -This is unbelievable. How can this be? -What's this? I brought it from Italy. -Do you want it? -Yes. On one condition. If you take it, you have to use it all the time. Keep it, then. -No, Ahmed. Don't use this here. -What's all this clutter? Let's have some fun. Wipe that pout off your face. -Happy birthday. -Come on, let's sing. This is good. Come on. Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to Omar Happy birthday to you Leave the rest to me, Nada. Listen, I can't stand to see you like this. Why don't you move in with us rather than be a wandering bum? If you're worried about dad, I can talk to him. Okay, tell me about work. What's new with you? I have a few projects in the works. Wish me the best. -God bless you. Do you need any money? -No, I have enough. -Are you sure? -Yes. Ahmed, Laila, come on. Later. We'll get going now. -Is everything alright? -Yes. Come on, Laila. Let's go. -Thank you for visiting. -Of course. -Do you need anything? -No, thank you. Okay. Are you sure? Okay. -Don't forget to clean that filth. -Of course. -Buy cleaning supplies. -Okay. -Goodbye. -Bye. Omar? How are you? I'm fine. How are you doing? Great. Are you back from the U.S. for good, or just on vacation? I came back a year ago. No, that's not right. I returnedâ€¦ Two years and six monthsâ€¦ Three years ago. -Do I look miserable? -No, like you always have. But you look different. -Am I uglier? -No. Prettier, actually. What's new with you? How's life? Nothing much. I'm a housewife, cooking and attending to my kids all the time. How many kids? How many? Just one, but I can barely deal with her. -What's the name of your daughter? -Fatima. -How old is she? -Seven years. How long have you been married? -Omar, I'll be nine years married soon. -Really? Yes. -Haven't you got married yet? -Not yet. Not yet. So, is there no one special in your life? You can say there is one. -What's her name? -Lina. -Okay. -But we had a fight a while back. The usual Omar, of course. Don't make it harder for me. Okay, I have to go. Likewise. -Take care. -You too. Do you know that I became addicted to nuts after you? Remember when you used to comfort me with nuts? I would buy them in bulk for you. Such beautiful days. Do you remember the type I used to like? I think it was spicy nuts. Like this one, with pepper. Right. Remember the type I used to like the most? I think you used to likeâ€¦ this. And I still do. Why do you look so miserable? I told you, that question was all over your face. Nothing. I've quit directing. It just didn't work out. But it's really not a big deal. Don't worry about it. You'll never change, will you? No, the same dimwit you know. The one who fights with cops, gets thrown in jail, makes no money, and can't even direct a film. Apparently, I really need to change. -Omar, I think I owe you an apology. -Why? Remember when we wanted to break up? I told you, "You have to become a director". Remember? -Yes, I remember. -I was buttering you up. I had to tell you something to avoid upsetting you. Apparently, I forgave you a long time ago. Take care of yourself, Omar. You take care too. -I hope to see you again soon. -Hopefully. What did you just do? Don't count after me. -One, two-- -Don't count after me. Okay. -Peace be upon you. -And peace be upon you. And may upon you be peace. I went to your shop and Mahrus told me I'd find you here. Welcome. -Keep playing. -Sit down, young man. Sit down, don't distract us. -I wanted to talk to you, Uncle Farid. -Speak. Speak. Do you need an invitation? I want you to get back into cinematography. I brought you some extra photos in case you need them. I'm not here for photos, but for the film I told you about -Which film? -The one about Jeddah. Yeah, The Real Jeddah. Yes. I'm sorry. I can't. It's not an actual job. You'd only need to give me some info, tell me some tales. Didn't you come here for that ad? There is no longer an ad. I resigned from the company. You're the only one who can help me. I got you trapped. Sometimes, you might get a double six and still not win because someone like him got you trapped. Why don't you want to help me? You don't need me or my help, young man. What a generation! May God aid you. And who's responsible for this generation? Isn't it your responsibility? Whose fault is it? How can people ever learn about you when you're so isolated? Are you dumb? Sure, and you're the intellectuals from Umm Kulthum and Abd al-Wahhab's days. The ultimate generation. Sit down, young man. We're sick of you, man. What's wrong with this young man? -He's at the end of his rope. -Indeed, he is. -Where are we going? -Why didn't you ask before coming with me? There, I just asked you. -Leave questioning to me. -Go ahead. Who's the girl you're in love with? Why are you asking? I ask the questions. I've only asked one, yet you're evading it. I didn't mean that. I'm just amazed that you know. I've known that girl for two years. Our love is mutual, and I doubt I can find a girl who can get me like she can. Everything was great between us, but I don't know what happened. Is she beautiful? -Is she or what? -Yes, she is. It seems to me that you've angered and upset her. Keep going. -We just have some misunderstanding. -Continue describing her to me. I don't need to know about the troubles between you. Peace be upon you, Mr. Hasan. -Welcome. -How are you? -God bless you. -Is this fish today's batch? What's the matter, man? It's not your first time eating at my restaurant. Unbelievable! I'm dying for some grouper fish. I want one for me and this young man. You got it. A great grouper for a great gentleman. -What a young man. Is he your son? -No, my son-in-law. He had a fight with her, so I brought him to have fish here and lighten his mood. That's not right. May God lead his way. This fish can be found in two places. Either in the sea, or in the oil Such wise words, Hasan. Did you hear that, Omar? Girls are like these fish. Your heart has to be either like the sea, or boiling oil. Either way, they'll still live. -Shall we eat here or outside? -Outside, buddy. -White rice or sayadieh? -Sayadieh. Thank you, Uncle Hasan. By the name of God. Why did you quit cinematography, Uncle Farid? Because cinema needs a lot of people to believe in it. An industry can't be fulfilled with one or two people working in it. But you had the experience you needed to keep going, at least. Who says we didn't fight and strive? Yet, everything went unheeded. Is there even anything to say? What about what you and I are discussing? What matters is that you know what you're talking about. You remind me of a film director who used to find Jeddah the world's greatest city. He abandoned every city that was wide open for him, which left him broke at the end. That was until he admitted his defeat against them. Why do you think he was defeated? Because he was by himself. Here's the answer to your question about why we were defeated. This place is 40-years-old, and it never had success. Is that why you found it hard to talk about Jeddah? Art is creation. It comes from the soul like a divine attribute. From the world around you. You do nothing but transmit the episodes you're living. But I want to talk about Jeddah, not myself. The city where an artist lives and grows is always a huge part of their life. How you understand Jeddah is how you understand yourself. Each person has their own Jeddah. Jeddah never belonged to one person. You think I understand myself, Uncle Farid? You're asking me? Ask yourself. It's weird that you're still unknown. I'm a fundamentalist, not a careerist. What do you mean? For example, you could've kept working on that ad, made money, and got famous. But you're a rightful man who wants the truth, and the truth can hurt many. -Okay, what about this film? -Yeah, I filmed it in France. What's the deal with France? How wonderful France, its people, and its film industry are! Tell me about it. I've lived three periods of time. My life started in Egypt in 1958. I admired Gamal Abdel Nasser. Yes, but how is this related to France? I was getting to it. My late father never approved of someone from Mecca majoring in film studies. He tried to give me a car so I'd stay. I sold it and ran away to France to spend the best seven years of my life. In that case, the must've been filmed in the last year. And after our defeat, we failed to keep our promise, and we came back. The movie seems to be full of love. This is Sofia. I met her during the second year. I was shooting a film there when she appeared before my camera like an angel. It was the hardest and most beautiful thing I've ever filmed. Do you have a camera? No, but I can bring one. Bring it and follow me. Hello, Salim. Would you bring me a camera and a mic? Awesome. I'll send you my location. Yes, we were talking on the radiotelephone and the weather was amazing. It's hard to forget such times. You're such a beast! -Were you going to film without me? -I've missed you. -Put your stuff right here. -Peace be upon you. -And peace be upon you. -And peace be upon you. What's this? I see you've brought cameras. Are you going to shoot like the old days? You can say that, but it's Omar who wants to film the inhabitants of this area. -Are you shooting a documentary? -Something like that. -Do you want some background actors? -No, Uncle, you're a star. But we're making a film about the cinema in the old Jeddah. My brother Farid can help you with that. Our old man here is playing hard to get. Also, I need your points of view as well. What exactly do you need to know? Jeddah in the old days, your tales, and the cinema field at the time. Come here, Mr. Director, and take a look at the shot. -Beautiful. -You've seen nothing yet. What can I say about Jeddah? Its beauty is beyond our words. Whichever words we use to describe it can't do it justice. In my opinion, Jeddah is the world's most beautiful city. I can tell you about its pillars, neighborhoods, alleys, and mosques. It's beautiful all around. We've lived days here we'll never forget. Jeddah is a complicated city. Jeddah is a beautiful city full of antiquities and good-hearted people. The younger ones the older ones are kind to each other. They check on each other and welcome each other. But all of that has changed. It's no longer that way. Jeddah has brought people from all over the world. They established themselves in it and rewarded it with love and gratitude. Jeddah will always be beautiful, if God's willing. Jeddah's beauty lies in its people's good and welcoming hearts. They open their hearts before their doors, and warmly welcome visitors, as I said. Whoever visits Jeddah or lives in it will have an unimaginable impression. They'll wonder if people anywhere else are as big-hearted as those in Jeddah. Whatever Jeddah stands for exists in any other city in the world, but its historic position and its people give it a magical effect. Hearts used to be close. You could wander in the streets without sensing any greed or avarice. Nothing but love, cooperation, compassion, and gracefulness between us. But recently, all of that was destroyed. Our spirits are no longer what they were. I don't know and can't predict if those days will ever come back, but Jeddah is truly beautiful. Being a coastal city, you'll sense that it's a rather liberated place. As the gate of the two holy mosques, it welcomes people from across the globe. Listen. The secret behind Jeddah's beauty lies within its love. And that's because the love is requited. You need to open your heart to it so that it lets you in. Raise the mic a bit, Hala. -Like this? -A bit more. Great. We're ready, boss. We're ready, Sir. What do you want me to say? You've spent years behind the camera. Don't you know what to say in front of it? Okay. Welcome. I asked her to come. Omar, get up and let her sit here. Hello, my lady. Thank you, dear. -Are you al-Najjar's daughter? -Yes. May you rest in peace, Fuad. -Did you know my grandfather? -Of course. We went to Victoria College in Alexandria together. Then we worked together in the cinema field. He built his own cinema and worked on it while mine remained the way it was. He went through a lot of trouble because of it. May you rest in peace. Why don't you dump this hot mess and marry me instead? I'm sorry if it bothered you that I came here unannounced. I felt so happy for you and I wanted to come. It's okay, and this is not my house. Also, I'm sorry if I hurt you unintentionally. You have a special place in my heart and I don't want you to be upset with me. I'm sorry too. It wasn't right what I did the last time. I'm no longer mad. Also, I think it had to happen for us to understand each other and ourselves. I don't know. I think I agree, but that depends on what each one of us realized. Whatever we realized, it's fine. -Anyway, do you have any hate for me? -No. -Not at all? -Not at all, and thank you for comingâ€¦ -You're still here? -Yes, but I'm leaving now. -What are you doing? -Go away, Salim. -Don't you want to go with us? -No, the driver is waiting. -Goodbye. -Bye. Bye. If you need any help with the movie, I'll be by your side. You too. If you ever need any help, I'll always be there for you. I'm serious. Okay, I'd better go. -It's great. Good job. -This is nothing. Flamingo, right? -Yes. Do you like it? -It's wonderful. You never told me. Where do you plan to premier the movie when you're finished? I don't know. I haven't thought about it yet. But it'll most likely be premiered in someone's home. How about Uncle Farid's cinema? -What a creative idea! -Isn't it? Why not? -What do you think, Sir? -Are you all serious about this? But it's been closed for 30 years. And it'll remain that way unless we do something. Things have changed. I'll try to get a license. -It's a nice idea, butâ€¦ -But what? It's a done deal. -I'll call Lina and get her to help us. -No, don't call her. -Yes, I will. -Don't. I'll call her myself. Good. Okay. We'll start tomorrow, hopefully. -Great -I'm ready. Once you're done installing the screen, make sure that it's at least one meter away from the wall, okay? -Don't worry. -Thank you. When does Omar expect the show to start? I think that depends on licenses. -I'm super excited. It looks awesome. -I love the performance. Give us the news. They didn't approve. -What didn't they approve? -Issuing my licenses. -Didn't they tell you why? -What's the matter, young man? I went there, and they kept redirecting me to each other's offices. They ended up telling me to find another venue, as this one was rejected. -Should I ask everyone to stop working? -Sounds like you should. Is that it? Let's go there. Come on, young man. Oh my God! -Is this whole building for them? -Yes. -And it's full of employees? -Yes. Yet, no one could issue you a license. Show me to the office of whoever denied your license. -What are you planning to do? -None of your business. Take me there. Be my guest. -Peace be upon you. -Welcome. So, tell me. Any luck? Still no luck. Help me understand, why was the license denied? I don't know, actually. Who's the one in charge here? Listen. Down the hall, you'll find Mr. Rami. He's in charge of licenses. -Thank you. -Of course. Uncle, the license was denied and we have no explanation. First of all, I'm not your uncle. Secondly, why wasn't there an explanation? I don't have the slightest idea. I receive orders from above and simply do my job. Will people in this country ever stop using that sentence? Let me meet whoever is above you. -Who are you talking about? -Abd al-Aziz. Abd al-Aziz who? The minister. Farid! Glad to see you, you great artist. Man, we haven't met in 15 years. Can you believe it? 15 years? -You've been the one avoiding me. -Hello, young man. Please be seated. They gave me so much troubleâ€¦ before they could let me in to meet you. It's okay, Farid. Be patient for my sake. You know all about such protocols. My heart is with you. This is Omar, the director. -The one making the film. -Hello, young man. How are you? -God bless you. -Welcome. -Aren't we drinking anything? -No, thank you. Did they let you know, or should I tell you myself? They did. Farid, your cinema has a problem as old as time. Find another venue, man. Yes, but I can't understand what's wrong with it, or the scrutiny over it. Is it that hard to premier the movie in some other venue? We've equipped the place, spent money on it, and now it's ready for a showing. Omar, I'll be very honest with you. Farid's cinema has an ancient problem and Farid knows that very well. If the cinema was opened and used for movie showings, that'd give us endless troubles. What a strange thing! I've been hearing that for 40 years. Has nothing changed? Farid, so much has changed and evolved. But apparently, your isolation has forbidden you from keeping up. Anyway, Omar, authorizing Farid's cinema would put me in a compromising position. Find another venue, and I'll have the office manager ease your paperwork. If the showing starts, tell him to inform me, and I'll be there. We can't put you in an awkward position with something beyond your capability. -Thank you, Abd al-Aziz. -Farid, you were the smartest among us. But you need to stop resisting everything. Some things need patience and coping. -You're right. Goodbye. -Goodbye. Now, we have to find another venue to premier the movie without delay. Omar, I have a question. Do you love Lina? -Yes. -A lot? -Really? -Yes, really. Good. Well, if her parents forbade you from marrying her for invalid reasons, how many attempts would it take for you to give up and fear for your dignity? That's what I thought. Where are you going? -Home. -Are you leaving us already? I did all I could do. Let me give you a lift. You'll barely be done on time. You have so much work to do. -It's nothing. I'll give you a ride. -I'm going now. Peace be upon you. I know you're mad at me. But what can I do? It's the powerful overruling the weak. I came to let you know about the premier date. I want you to witness how excited people will be to see your work. So, you're not coming? Omar, Farid asked me to give you this. What's this? It's the key to the shop. And here's the key to the cinema. -Okay? -Okay. The people who say they'll bring Jeddah back. That's you. An artist's job is to share their own world with people. To showcase their life from a unique point of view. What matters is that you work on your present. Because it'll have a great significance and be talked about for years to come. Talk about me, about yourselves, and about Jeddah. Are we done? Subtitle translation by: Ammar Abd Al-Aziz
