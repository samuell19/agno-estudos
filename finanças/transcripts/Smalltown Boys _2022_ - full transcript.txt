SMALLTOWN BOYS Gentiane...? It would've been easier to buy them online. Oh no... We support local businesses. "Local businesses." - Jacques is waiting for me. - No! Stay with me, please! Ok, just go. I like the Rolls Royce... Hello sweetheart. Hi Uncle. You're the "uncle from the country"? I feel like cattle! Luggage in the front and everyone in the back. No distinction! - Mind my feathers. - We'll get tetanus in there! - Get moving. This is Loca-Coca. - Nice to meet you. Fred, our stage manager. And... Jonas! Also known as "Baby Sun". - I'm good. - Sure? I could use some help. I'm road sick already. Careful. Oh my! Mind your feet. Beautiful. The middle of nowhere! After you, young man. Get us out of here! Good evening everyone. I told them you were my nephew. Some are coming just for you. You'll see familiar faces. Youcef, the keys? I need to go to Dusseau's to pick up Pascal's chairs. Can I? Sure. It'll be a surprise. Put the beers in the fridge and off you go. Tell Pascal I didn't forget about him! Ok. Much like the women do, We have a soul, a heart to tend to Yet who would ever care? For pleasure is why we're there The love we get from men was always meant for them Blase and vicious they are, all of them Lead by instinct, what do they want us for? A quick embrace, nothing more Caresses for which they pay - Can I have some water? - Sure. Thanks. ...fill our glasses with dismay. Be cool. We know the moves. We haven't rehearsed together. That's not how I work. I didn't warm up. We can do it last. Hey. Sorry for being a nuisance! You could also thank them if that's not too painful for you! They bust their asses for no extra pay. You're the one who wanted a trio. Calm down. Everything's fine. I'm perfectly calm. I have some errands to run. - Need anythng? - I could use some air. - What a great idea. - Indeed. Thank you! Our little diva's on fire. - The chairs? - Yes. I'll tell delivery. Mrs Girard, we no longer take checks. But I never know what's left on my debit card. I've always preferred checks. Nobody uses them anymore. I came for my sofa two months ago. Your colleague didn't seem to mind. We'll make an exception as a favour to you. Hello Youcef. Hello. How's the restaurant? Good, thanks. I insisted that my niece's wedding dinner take place there. I said you were a young couple starting your business both dedicates and very nice. She said, "why not?" So it's looking good for now... I'm counting on you. It's delicious there. Have you ever been? I haven't. I always say, "Pascal's table is delectable!" Don't pay attention. He's goofing around behind your back. I've seen others. You can go out back for the chairs. Where do you think you are?! You shouldn't here done that. I'm telling you. Did you see how she talked to you? Old hag... I know her, she's very nice! You were rude. There's no other word for it. It won't hurt those hillbillies to get some perspective. They make me so uncomfortable. I could be in trouble. You just come here and act crazy. Forgive me. I'm sorry. Pascal charmed me, I was still a teenager. Nearly three years ago. Now, we've moved in together. We live above the restaurant. It's cool. I'm lucky. Yeah. It's nice. It's nice... Do you ever think about getting married? Maybe. It could be useful. The white dress...! As a kid, I always wanted to know if people were married. Cashiers, teachers... The people I met... Marriage felt reassuring. It meant they'd been saved. Can I ask you a question? It might sound stupid... - Do you need an assistant? - What? To help with your meetings, your schedule, whatever. Like a secretary. I'm not a star, I'm just ... It's not about the money. I can work for free to get some experience. If i work as a driver, I can put it on my resume. Who knows? You might need to travel a lot. Think aboit it and let me know. I can do something else in the meantime. I can work two jobs. It's great. - Thanks. - No problem. Thank you too. - It looks better, right? - Yeah. Come and see us tonight. I can't. I have to cook for you all. I'm done. I need to freshen up. Upstairs, first door on you left. Sorry. How long have you been here? Three years. Time to leave, then. Ever heard of the rule of threes? It's not that easy. My boyfriend's restaurant is taking off. - It took time to build a chance. - Do it elsewhere. He wants to buy this place here. It freaks me out. The mortgage, the bank... But he thinks long term. "You go big or you disappear." We won't be leaving tomorrow. And I wouldn't know where to go. No idea? Well... I talked to Jonas earlier. Maybe... I don't know... I could work as his assistant. His assistant? Great idea. - What's the job description? - Stop it. I suppose it depends on his activity. I could be in charge of that. I'd bring new business and get paid by booking shows. I don't know much about things yet. What do you think? Spoken like a true entrepreneur! That's very good! Girls, my lipstick?! And go international... He's a dancer, no need to translate. Do you speak English? It's obvious the American market is longing for "Baby Sun"! I can picture his name on a marquee in Chicago. - Las Vegas... - Vegas! "The French bitch and his marvelous assistant!" Don't push it. You're right. Start small. Would you be his home assistant? - In charge of his toilet? His ass? - Don't. Nothing like a good ass-istant! Ass-k the ass-istant for his ass...! I'll call you back. Bye. Sorry about the assistant thing. I don't know what got into me. It's fine. Don't worry. I love the show business but it's new to me. Youcef is good with numbers. He could help out. I'm sure he's totally capable. He was our postman when I was a kid! Weren't you paying attention? You were with me at the bar. You didn't see the guy with a big mustache?! It was a dream. You made it all up. Nonsense! - Who? - Stop it! Some guy with a mustache in the front now. I didn't see him... Ouch. - Good evening. - You don't look good, love. Easy, tiger! We taught him well! Thank you. So! What did you think of the show? It was good. - I meant to tell you... - Hold on! Speech. Speech! Speech! It's not a political speech! Youcef for president! Congratulations to all of you! - I raise my glass... - How sweet. - To... - Daddy Darling. Daddy Darling, that's right. To... To Princess! Close call! To... Loca Cola, darling! People never remember you! As long as we remember your butt! - To Gentiane! - A drink for Gentiane! Mummy is finishing all the drinks! - And... - Last but not least! To Baby Sun! Especially Baby Sun! A kiss! A kiss! Knock it off! On the lips! On the lips! No way! - Youcef, don't be so shy! - Just a kiss. Get over there and kiss the guy! He can't do it! Too shy! Get up on the stage, darling. Get on that chair! Come on. Wait! Wait! Any ritual calls for ornaments! I love it! She's gorgeous! You're our Josephine Baker! Enough! What's next? Bananas?! Easy. It's only a joke. A kiss! A kiss! A big kiss! Drop the shirt! The shirt! We should find him name! The shirt! The trousers! The trousers! All the way! It's fine. I'll take care of him. Come this way. Have you had your coffee, girls? It got a little out of hand... Weird. It's a wrap! - Bye. - See you. Take care. - Thank you. - My pleasure. Jacques said yes. He's selling to me. We have to be together in this. Yes, I know. You don't have to. You can change your mind. I'm not forcing you. It doesn't mean we'll stay here forever. Of course. But there's a choice to make. If we start here, we can't just leave the next day. Look what we found! No! My balloon! That's mine. Can I come? My brother's here. My place then? I was at a party last night, I'm exhausted. My mom is out for the day. I'm horny. So? It's a little strange. To each their own. You have nice spots in the Creuse area. And you find more mountains in the south of Creuse. The Millevache plateau is down there. That's right. It's a good little hike. Then you reach Correze. Correz, that's right. I don't want to know. I'm tired of this! Hi Auntie. How are you? I didn't get Reims. I'm guttered. I could try Vincennes, but it's not the kind of school I want. Yeah. I'm waiting for Angouleme. I'll let you know. We'll see. Yeah. Classes start in ten days. It's time I made up my mind. What are these for? They're Elodie's. I was wearing them earlier. But one broke. I'll buy a new pair. What are you up to? You clearly told me to fuck off earlier, so I thought... Thought what? We'd better meet in person. I'm not in the mood right now. You're happy to find me when you want to fuck. You could also listen to me. I'm all ears. Take a guess. Well, I have feelings. That's all. Oh please. Soon, we won't be seeing each other. You in Angouleme. Me, God knows where. Well, yeah. I know we only see each other by default. Admit it. You don't get much choise around here. What's the drama? We never talked of being together. That's not what I'm saying. You always want to hide, keep it secret... Will we ever do it again? You don't get it. To remember me by. I'll be right back. Lean forward. A little less. Don't move. That's great. Hold on. Close your eyes. Extend your left arm. Yes. Keep straight. Look to the other side. Hide the lace. Don't move. Great. Turn around. We don't see your sword. What's going on? I thought the photos were just a hook-up. I was surprised you walked out. Are you disappointed? No. - Photos usually take a turn... - Not with me. It's work. And I pay. Here. Is that you wife in the picture? My sister. She looks nothing like you. We're twins. Finding a carpool won't be easy. - I told you there were buses. - Not until 6:20 pm. I can drive you to the station after my appointment. I'm bad with cars but I recognized the dolphin. You're the nephew. I'm Lucie. How do you do? How do you do? Tell your mother I said hello. Is she better? Ups and downs. These illnesses are hard. Did you see the exhibition? You should really see it. Mathieu does beautiful things. - You work for city hall? - Among other things. Fortunately, it's Saturday or I'd be on shift in Montargis for food aid. I do all the afternoons until 8. I'm used to it. I've worked at the factory from 1 to 8 all my life. By the time you're home, every film on TV has already started. You can watch them online. I'm useless with that. TV is what it is. Oh well... Since I started working, we went from 8:30 to 8:40, then 8:55 and I've always missed the beginning no matter what. Hello Mathieu. It was high time I'd met your nephew. I told her about Mom, how she was feeling... I brought you the flyers. Print quality isn't so good. Sloppy work! I'd never seen that one before. - Which one? - This one. I don't have my glasses. It's one of my latest. Look. On the right, by the post next to the path. There's a couple. I really like it. What does your sister have? A son your age. I'm sure you gathered. And a recurrence of cancer. What's your real job? Teacher. Spanish teacher. Need a nephew again? "I came to see my uncle for the weekend." Isn't that nice? "My old lonely uncle!" "What an artist he is!" "He has an eye." "So much to find out about." "A secret yet beautiful body of work." What are you doing tonight? Seeing friends? Not really. Any plans? A young man who courted anyone... Hello? Yes. Hello? Hello?! You little pricks have nothing better to do? Leave me the fuck alone. You hear? Morons. That was ok. But last time... They slashed my tires twice. Thank you. Oops. I try to picture you at school. How you address the students. How you dress. These days, I wear that jacket you see over there. And this cap. Let me see. Walk around. As if you arrived at school. Yeah. Look's good. You're entering the teachers' room. Now, speak Spanish. - I don't speak Spanish with colleagues. - I have an idea. Here. Put this on. Your turn. Do it once in your life! I'm too old for this. And take your jumper off. - Do you ask guys to wear makeup? - Sometimes. The marquis. Marquis? Wanna be a marquis? Where did you get all this? I found some on the internet. The rest came from the festival comittee. The chairwoman is a friend. Disguises... Disguises are what turn you on. That's your thing. Judging other people's fantasies... It would take while. I'm not judging, I'm noting. I've done photo shoots and weird hook-ups but nothing like this. I promise. I'm only curious. You're not curious. You're making fun. Leave it, please. Is it for someone? - Put it away. - For who is it? Yes, it's for someone. The venues outside of Paris can be surprising. One day, the dressing room was behind coat hangers. I got changed, got up on stage and the curain... it reeked of puke. I have an act where i take off my shorts and I'm wearing a thong. I pulled the shorts down, the floor was all sticky as the previous act used hairspray. So I messed up and my shorts got caught in my shoes. I managed to toss the shorts and a guy in the front row got up to catch them. I got off stage to the dressing room and the guy showed up with my shorts and two other men. He stared at me. I said hi and thanked him for earlier but the guys were staying, stalking me like a zoo. So I finally asked my shorts back and the guy said, "Only if you blow me." I acted like this was all a big joke. But the two dudes were blocking the exit. I started to freak out. I locked him in the eyes and said, "Fine. Unzip." And so he did. A nightmare. In the end, his friends stopped him. We get loads of these jerks. I've sucked dicks unwillingly but in this case, I was the dancer. It's not the same! Anyway... I do it for the money. Otherwise, I'm part of a company. - We were a hit in Chicago. - Chicago? - Amazing. - Yeah. For now, I'm on holiday at my parents'. I help my father with his gardening business. Damn it. There's a stain. Sorry. Let me tell you, I'm glad you stayed. Me too. No parents around for a change. And it's a change in the humdrum of a countryside amateur photographer. - What about your old fag's whore humdrum? - My what? Ok. Your humdrum as an insignificant teacher who... You hook-ups humdrum! Your festival committee humdrum. Your dating apps humdrum. - Humdrum! - Humdrum! Beep. The alarm went off. You're pretty good at this. For a young man not so young who lies about his age to stay in the game. Same for you, the old disheartened fagot. As long as the flesh is legal... What's wrong? I don't know. A smile not too provocative? Unbuckle your belt. Slowly. Look into the camera. With an empty look. Take off your underwear. It's cold in here. - I was already cold last time. - We won't be long. Take the robe off. Hand on your hip. That's right. So we can see your bum. My little bum. Turn around. Squat. Let go of your dick. You can't get enough. Delete Coffee? Sure. I looked into your computer last night. There were photos... Mine. I've erased the entire memory. I'm sorry, Mathieu. I might sound harsh but... I find you disgusting. You're disgusting. I want to leave and never hear from you. I know my life looks pathetic to you. But I see people. I work. I've organized my time, my relationship, and my sexuality. I had doubts I'd ever get there. Doubts I could ever live. What is she doing here? Do you mind walking? The bus station isn't far. Are you going to Montargis? I can take you after this. Couldn't you stay longer? You never visit your uncle. I'd love to but I have work. In that case... I've retired ten years ago. Moving in the nude, Tears are bubbling I get back up at dusk I walk alone, You can have me... As much as ever. The only lesson that I've ever learned Is that it won't kill us No, it won't kill us, The night of a sad day Love won't kill us anymore. Love won't kill us anymore No, love won't kill us anymore. Pass right through Embrace the air around you, Here I am, Right in front of you. After patience, Comes the absence, Come right into me. The only lesson that I've ever learned Is that it won't kill us, The night of a sad day, But love won't kill us anymore. If I run away come after me You, you, you... ...who are trying. For help you cry, In-between skies, You, you... Who are finding your way. The only lesson that I've ever learned Is that it won't kill us, The night of a sad day, But love won't kill us anymore. Love won't kill us anymore Love won't kill us anymore. Moving in the nude, Tears are bubbling I get back up... At dusk. I walk alone, You can have me... As much as ever. The only lesson that I've ever learned Is that it won't kill us No, it won't kill us, The night of a sad day, But love won't kill us anymore...
