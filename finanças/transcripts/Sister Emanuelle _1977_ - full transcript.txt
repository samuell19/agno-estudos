Couldn't you hurry up? I had told you I had an important appointment. I am sorry boss, but the train was late, you know... The train, the train! Nowadays stationmasters are not the same! Back in my day the trains were on time! Welcome, sisters. Thank you. Thank you. After me, please. I was looking forward to commiting to your care my daughter, Monica, my only child. We heard she is a little too restless and quite out of hand, but what can you expect from the girls of today, right'? Out of hand? You are kidding me. Monica is a child. Obviously she has her faults, like everyone-- And we'll try to rectify them with Christian patience. Good! But I have to rush now. Sergio! Come here! My wife will take you to the train station by motorboat. I am sorry, but I really have to go. Sergio! Come take the sisters' luggage. Sure, doctor. You must be Monica. And you are her friend'? No. She is my mother. How is it possible? It's true, I am the doctor's wife, and therefore I'm her mother. Wake up at 7:00 with a nice coffee. A coffee tomorrow morning is fine. But now I'd like a digestive liqueur. I ate too much. The food is delicious in these dining oars. Okay, I'll bring it right away. Good evening, sisters. And if you need anything during the night, and I mean, anything... You just have to ring the bell, okay? - Good night. - Good night. Good night, sister. Monica and I are going to sleep. You put me in a compartment different from yours, though, and close to the toilet, too. Sister Nana, I did it with good intentions- because of your illness. Yes, right. Good night. And remember that you will die. - Sister Nana? - What? We shall die. And what did I say? You said "you will". Well, come on, you will, we shall, what's the difference? - Good night. - Good night. Good night. At last we are alone. Who is going to undress first? You're welcome to undress yourself, Monica. I'll take the upper berth. Okay, sister. Do you know why my father is sending me to boarding school? No, I don't know. Why is that? He's mad jealous of Chris, his wife. At his age, he's marrying someone younger than me. You saw her, right? He really wants to be cuckolded, that idiot. She is thirty years younger than him. He really is crazy. Stop it, Monica. Go to sleep. Okay, sister, okay. If you think that I am going to stay in boarding school for long, you are making a blunder. Sister? What's the matter? Why is it that a pretty girl like you became a sister? Have you ever heard of vocation? Vocation? Judging from your face, your vocation is quite the opposite. Enough, Monica. Be quiet and sleep now. Sister? Don't you undress yourself? Oh, I see. You feel embarrassed because of me. Sister Emanuelle! I am scared! - What's the matter? - Let me stay here close to you. Monica, what are you doing'? I am scared. - Monica. - I am so scared. Be a good girl. Don't be a child. I am scared. It's just a storm. Relax. Don't be scared. You'll see, it was only a nightmare. No, it wasn't a nightmare. It was true. It was all true. It was just a night like this. Lightning, thunder. I was soaking wet. I was cold. So cold. And I started running to warm myself. The blinding light of a lightning showed them to me. They were three ugly mugs, and from their faces I immediately understood what their intentions were. They were waiting for me at the opening, like hungry wolves ready to jump at the lost sheep's neck. - What? - Hey! What the...? I started running like crazy. But they were faster than me and caught me in a second. They grabbed me and... Poor child. Now I understand why you are so scared by the storm. Yes, it always reminds me of that event. Those vile men! But you must forgive your torturers, like a Christian martyr. No, I will never forgive them. Those brutes! Monica! Go away! Go away! Go straight to your bed! How dare you behave like that? How dare you! It's unbelievable. Hey, what did I do? I just gave you a little kiss. What a fuss, sister Emanuelle! You really are a lost soul. I lost the soul, but not the body. Monica, are you okay? I am not Monica. I really feel sick. Oh, I am sorry, sister. Do you need any help? I don't really know how you could help me. This cystitis is God's punishment. I will pray for you, sister. Amen. Yes. You're good. Like that. Yes. Go on. Yes. Good. Where have you been'? I had a drink. I was so thirsty. Reverend Mother, this is the new student. Help! - I want to leave! - Monica! - I want to go home! - Monica, where are you going? Let me out of here! Stop it! Don't be a child. Stop it. Stop it! Leave me alone! I want to leave! Keep still. Keep still! Don't act like that! No! Enough. Enough! Let me go! She's a maniac. This is crazy. Keep still. Keep still! Give me a hand. Let's turn her over. No! No! Keep her still! When you first came here, I believed in your sincerity in your repentance. I welcomed you, you hardened sinner, because I believed in your will to make good your life, to come out from the filth you had always lived in. I believed, in short, that a divine miracle could happen. And instead... But I did nothing bad. I don't understand. Nothing, huh? And the panties? Those are nothing for you, huh? The panties? What panties? You wretched woman! I've seen it clearly, while you were wrestling with the possessed girl, that you weren't wearing the panties prescribed by our regulations. Forgive me. Forgive me. It's true, Reverend Mother, I wasn't wearing the chastity panties because my skin can't tolerate rough cloth. Wicked woman! You, a sister, you dare talk about skin? Skin must be chastised, torn, tortured as a sign of repentance for your sins. I will do it. I will do it, Reverend Mother. I will wear the chastity panties as if they were a cilice, to humiliate my flesh, to make it suffer, but please, forgive me. Don't hurl me into the hell I came from. All right. This time I'll forgive you, but remember what I'm telling you. From now on, you sinner, I will keep an eye on you. If I find you again wearing that dreadful rag of perdition, I will throw you back to secular status, I will invoke upon you all the torments of Satan! I'll have you transferred. Where's the bathroom? Over there. Here'? Yes. Tell me, do you often suffer from these fits of hysteria? And do you often suffer from these fits of shittiness'? Listen, everyone here knows that you are a pest. That's why they put you in my room. Why? Do you have cholera? No, you don't get it. I am the best in class. I imagined that. And I am the best in conduct, too. From bad to worse. You look like someone who can make a saint lose his patience. Listen to her. Why, do you think you are a saint? Not yet. But I could become one if I'll manage to recover you and turn you into a good girl. That's why they put you with me. It's what I was trying to tell you. Will you cooperate? Don't worry, I'll do my best to make you gain ranks. Sorry. The halo. Thank you so much. We are friends now, aren't we? Sure. Actually, why don't we give each other a little kiss to celebrate? Those who asked me to go somewhere else were like the Earth. And I, who in Carthagine loathed a real poverty, in Rome I hoped in a false happiness. But the true reason for my going to Rome, only you did know that, and you did not tell it to me nor to my mother who sadly cried over my departure and came after me as far as the seashore. I am sorry, she is late, Reverend Mother. I didn't know the hours were so strict. I'm only two minutes late. No, don't sit. You will learn at your cost to be punctual. Take the place of Sister Emanuelle and read. Please, come. But while she held me tight and did violence to me in order to take me back or to come with me, I fooled her... - I am scared! - What are you doing? Are you crazy? Let me stay here with you, please. Alright. You can stay. I knew it. I knew that to become a saint, I should have passed the terrible test of temptation, like every self-respecting saint. Stop it. Go away. Go back in your bed. You had promised me that you would cooperate. It's what I am doing. The storm. Monica! No. No. Stop it. Stop it. Go back in your bed. And let's remember, young girls, that we shall die. Let's remember that we shall die. Let's remember that we shall die. Mother, let's remember that we shall die. Sister Nana. Cure this damned cystitis of yours. Don't wait for a miracle. Look at what you have done. You wetted the corridor. What is this? Do I even have to wet myself? Alright. Let's stop here, girls. Sit down. Sister Emanuelle, can we go to that cottage over there? Why? Is it so urgent? - Well, yes. - Yes. Okay, you go first, Monica. When you come back, Anna will go. Why not together? Hygiene. All right, girls! I'll play with you. Pass me the ball! Keep quiet! That's it, girls. Let's eat now. Well said, sister Emanuelle. Sister Emanuelle'? Monica hasn't come back yet. Monica! Take this, Francesca. You took your time, uh? Now you can go, Anna. Wait! I am coming with you. If I were you, I wouldn't go there. Monica! Mind your own business. Well, I warned you. And I'll tell you again. You'd better wet yourself than die. Die? What are you talking about? I am alive by a miracle. That cottage is infested with vipers. Vipers? Actually, some of them followed me. Oh, Jesus! So, where is this safe refuge'? I prepared everything. Up there, in the tower. Follow me. Come! Listen, darling. Are you sure that nobody is going to see us? Don't worry. Everybody is sleeping. You are Rene, right? And how do you know that? Your picture is in every newspaper, together with the tale of your mad ventures. You are a madman, you know? You've soared half of the world with all the mischief you've done. If they get you, you'll be in trouble. Aren't you afraid then? No. Why should I? On the contrary, I fancy men like you. You trust me, then. Of course. And you, didn't you put yourself completely into my hands by coming here? You're right. And you call this mess a refuge? It's not here. It's upstairs. Well, it's not the Grand Hotel, but it doesn't lack the comforts. What a pretty child. Simple. Sweet. But what a bitch. Are you talking to me? No, no. What time is it? It's 6:00. I have an hour left before the official call. An hour'? There's no time to waste. Yes... Yes! Monica. What is this farce'? Where have you been all night? I asked you where you have been. With Sister Emanuelle. So what? Stop in You are a bitch! You just don't give a damn! You do it on purpose to make me angry. Stop in You are mean! You are so mean! What are you crying for? How silly of you. Come on, dry me up. Massage my back. No! Forget it! Have your sister Emanuelle massage you. Come on, don't be a bitch. Jealousy doesn't exist for me, and it must not exist between us. If you won't do as I tell you, you will lose me. Anna. Come Oh, caress me. Harder. Harder. Are you mistaking my little ass for a baby's? Come on, girls! It's time to go back to class. Anna. Anna! Listen, you have to do me a big favor, please. What do you want'? You have to go say something to sister Emanuelle. Never! If you don't want to be a little saint again you'll have to do as I say. All right. Who is it? Someone. Anna? Anna, what happened? Are you sick? I need to talk to you. But, at this hour'? All right. Come on. Speak. Well, Monica is often missing during the night. I realized that she puts a dummy made of rags in her bed to make believe that she is there. She did it tonight too. And where does she go? In the tower. Why, you didn't know that? Of course, I don't know. And what's her business in the tower? It's what I am asking myself. Why does she go in the tower every night? Anna. It's no good, believe me. This is elation, curiosity. Go right back to your room now, and beg God's forgiveness for all these sinful thoughts. Yes, sister. Stay where you are! The show is not finished yet. Okay, okay, go on. I'll stay here. Go on. Go on. Come on, little bitch! Show me what they taught you in this school. Yes. Yes. Yes. Emanuelle, Emanuelle... Emanuelle! Don't move. Monica. Listen. Who is she? Are all the school's students like her? She is not a student. She is a nun. Monica! And who are you'? Oh, I am sorry. Let me introduce myself. I am Rene. Wanted by all the European law enforcements for a few rapes, a few robberies, some drugs. You know how it is, sister, one has to earn one's living. It was you that let him in here? Yes. He was so nice to me. I am going to immediately report his presence to the Reverend Mother. No! You can't, sister. And who is going to stop me, you? Him. Sister. Sister, I 'd rather not be wanted for slaughter. Therefore, I think you'd better be good and quiet. Monica, how could you... I am sorry, sister. Only you and I know about Rene's presence here. We are joined by a terrible secret now. Whether you like it or not, we are your accomplices. So? All right, I won't talk. But let it be clear. I am doing this only for the students' safety. I don't want to be responsible for a massacre. Anna! What are you doing up here? Didn't I tell you to go to your room and beg forgiveness for your sins'? And you? Why don't you go and beg forgiveness for yours? Anna. You are upset. You don't know what you're saying. Actually, I know it pretty well. Monica told me everything. What you mean? That you are her lover, she confessed me that, and that you meet in secret in the tower. Did she really tell you that? Yes. And you believed her? Yes. Anna. Look into my eyes. I swear on my clothes, on my soul, that there's absolutely nothing true in what Monica has told you. She is a wicked girl. Worse that I thought. You must believe me, Anna. Anna, please. You must believe me. Yes, I believe you. But now I am pleased with your reaction. Learning such a terrible thing about your teacher, about a nun, must have been a very hard blow for your purity and your innocence. What did you feel, my poor little Anna? An unbearable jealousy. Frightening. I didn't know I could be capable of such a thing. Jealousy? Jealous of me? Of course. Because I love Monica. But now I understand that it's just been a joke to tease me. Thank you, sister. Bring the bread. Yes, I'll do it. Good morning, sister Emanuelle. I heard that it was your turn at the refectory. Are you mad at me, sister Emanuelle? Monica, how many lies did you make up? Why did you tell Anna that we... What was I supposed to tell her'? That there is a criminal in the tower ready to kill us all'? I choose the lesser evil. Monica. You definitely have the skill of muddling my ideas. Why did you lure me into the tower? Why did you drag me in your intrigues? Why is there so much perversion inside you? I have already explained you the tragedy of my life, but you haven't understood me. I've understood you pretty well. You've suffered an abuse when you were a kid and your psychic balance has been compromised. Yet, this doesn't excuse you. You see? You say that you understand me and then you put the blame on me. Monica, it is how you've reacted to that abuse that I can't understand. You should hate men for what they have done to you, but you don't hate them at all. Actually, for quite a while I've been hating men with all my strength. Monica, what are you doing? But Dad... Didn't you tell me to make friends with my stepmother? That's why that asshole of my father decided to send me to boarding school. Tell me, sister Emanuelle, wouldn't you hate such a man with all your strength? Enough! Stop it! What's wrong with you? You try your best to wring my secrets from me and then you get angry. You sisters are really strange, you know? Monica, what is this joke? How dare you put your nightgown under my pillow? So why did you put it on? Please, let's not quarrel over a nightgown. Yes, I wanted to play a joke on you. But now something very serious has happened. That's why I am here, sister Emanuelle. Okay, let's hear it. What's wrong? Rene. How dare you talk to me about that bandit? Sister! Listen to me, for Heaven's sake. Okay, speak. Rene wants me to take Anna into the tower. What? He said that if I won't bring her to him, he'll come and take her himself. With all the possible consequences. But Anna is like a child, and she is a virgin, too. As far as men are concerned. That's the point. He is saying that he's never met a virgin in his life. Do you know what I mean? And this thing arouses him a lot. Sister, help me! What am I supposed to do? All right. Don't worry. I'll go talk to him. Hi. You want Anna, right? You Dig! You'll never have her! I'll offer myself in place of her. Come on! Give vent to your bestial instincts on me. Leave alone that poor innocent soul. But... I don't understand a thing, I swear. What does this mean? Come on! Are you coming? What are you waiting for? Hey, how impatient you are! Well done. You behave like you didn't like it. You are forgetting that I sacrificed myself in place of Anna. Sacrificed? Actually, it's the first time that Rene the rapist gets raped. Speaking of Anna... Enough! Stop provoking me. Okay, okay. But could you please tell me who the hell is this Anna? Wait a second. You forgot your nightgown. What's the matter with you? Are you out of your minds? Gerolamo! So you two are claiming that the gardener addressed you with indecent proposals, contrary to morality, and since you refused, he fired at you. Yes. Sister Nana. Mother, believe me, those girls are two liars. How come did he come by this obscene dress then? - Reverend Mother... - Shut up! You'll talk later. He is saying that he doesn't know what this thing is. He thought it was a rag when he found it. It's the Devil's work! Reverend Mother, I am guilty of all this. Reverend Mother. I have to make a terrible confession. Shut up! This is not the time to confess. Let's hear the defendant. It's not true that I didn't yield to this funny old man. Only Anna found the strength to deny herself. I, on the contrary, possessed by the demon of lust, I wasn't able to resist his lascivious caresses. Enough! We were feeding a snake in our womb without knowing it. Here is my sentence. The unworthy filthy gardener, Gerolamo Collegno, is dismissed from his job. The student Monica Cazzabriga is expelled from this boarding school. The student Anna Celestini will be rehabilitated by us to Heaven. Amen. Amen. I don't understand why you are putting that face. Aren't you happy to take me to the train station? Yes, boarding school is not for me. But I had fun, though. It's been a brief experience, but a very happy one. Why did you stop here? What's the matter with you? If we don't hurry, I'll miss my train! Are you out of your mind? Sister Emanuelle, are we going? Dear Monica, you've may have had a brief and happy experience, but I haven't, I guarantee you. Since I've had the misfortune of meeting you, you've forced me to sin, to forsake my duties and my conscience too. You've been playing with me like the cat plays with the mouse. You've forced me to lie, to break the vow I had made, to be party to your depraved games. From now on, I will conduct the game. I will show you who Emanuelle is, and what you have awakened in her. Where are you taking me? What are you doing? Where are we going? - Keep quiet! Go ahead. - What are you up to? Don't you remember those damned vipers? I want to see them too. You are crazy! Leave me alone! Oh, why? Why? What are you going to do to me? Have you gone out of your mind? - Come here. - Leave me alone! What are you doing'? Now I'll show you if I have gone out of my mind. Where are you going? Come here! Untie me. Rene! Come here! Come untie me. No, Rene. Not with her. No. No! No, no! Me too! Me too! Let me join you. Please! Be good, darling. Don't be impatient. It's your turn, now. No! No! Who is it? Good morning, sister. It's 7:00. I brought you the coffee. May I come in? Thank you, in five minutes. Okay. Did you sleep well? Yes, sister, I slept well. But I feel a strange sensation. Painful. Like a stinging right here. Come, Monica. Reverend Mother, this is the new student. Monica Cazzabriga, Reverend Mother. I heard about your restless temperament, but I can see that you are a well-mannered and respectful girl. May I go? Thank you. Monica? Come. Girls, this is your new mate. Here name is Monica. - Lucia. - Donatella. - Maria. - Bea. Hi. Come. And this is Anna. Anna is the best of the school in every sense. She will share her room with you. I hope that you will become friends and that you will get on well with us.
