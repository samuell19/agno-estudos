Not yet! Hey! Attention! Not yet! At ease! Now! Now! Hey! Attention! Fire! Fire! Finally. May I congratulate you, Majesty? You may, Baron, but first help me get into my robe. Yes. Beg your pardon? Oh, right. - Your robe. - Why wasn’t I informed? Her Majesty the Queen forbade to awaken your Majesty. - Come on... - There you go. - Get those balls out. - You mean me? No, I mean the pom-pom’s. Get those pom-pom’s out. Your slippers, your Majesty. Please. - Why did those cannons shoot? - On your Majesty’s command, to announce the royal birth. A boy? A girl. - A princess. - Well, then why look so sad? I’ve always wanted a little girl. Oh, never mind. Thank you, Eliška. Welcome, my daughter. Bravo! Hurray! Long live the King! Please. We, Dalimil I, King of the Rose Kingdom, do announce this festive moment... Put it away. Go. Away. No rubbish speeches... It’s a little girl! With my eyes! And she’s beautiful! She’s so beautiful, you cannot imagine! Long live the King! Bravo! May he live forever! And she will be called Růženka! She didn’t even read it. Don’t worry, Eliška, we did everything we could. Not everything. Yes, it’s me, dear sister. Why do you look so startled? Because I’m not wearing an ermine coat? Melanie, I could give you an ermine coat if you wanted one. - The Queen’s sister can’t just... - I don’t want to! I don’t want to be the Queen’s sister! I was supposed to be queen! I’m the firstborn! But I fell in love with Eliška. Please forgive us for that. I didn’t ask you to do that! Let bygones be bygones, Melanie, and come back to the castle with us. Do it for Růženka. So this is Růženka... She will make you very happy. You don’t need me for that. Very happy... - But not for always! - Be quiet! No one more word! I curse her! When she turns seventeen years old, she’ll prick her finger and sleep forever! And with her the whole kingdom! The whole kingdom, which should’ve been mine! Mine! Calm down, Eliška. Love is stronger than death. “Love is stronger than death...” Why did she tell us that? I’ll dispose of anything in the whole kingdom that could hurt her – every thorn, every rose – anything. ♫ By the seventh lane, by the seventh granary, ♫ ♫ a candle shone brightly on a little rose shrub. ♫ ♫ But the thorns were cut off, leaving a bleeding wound. ♫ ♫ They will never return, of that I am sure. ♫ ♫ O, rose hips! The river sings quietly, ♫ ♫ the horses dance their manes to a song in the distance, ♫ ♫ O, rose hips! How I long for you! ♫ ♫ Even the wind in the birches sang and played this song. ♫ ♫ By the seventh lane, by the seventh granary, ♫ ♫ a candle shone brightly on a rose shrub. ♫ ♫ But the thorns were cut off, leaving a bleeding wound. ♫ ♫ They will never return, of that I am sure. ♫ Careful, your Highness. Jakub, what are you doing here? Thorns. Come out! I know, you have your orders. What are you doing to us, your Highness? The seamstresses are waiting. Half a dozen guards, so I won’t prick myself. Half a dozen seamstresses, so I can be married. It’s a very special moment in your life, getting to choose a groom. Choose? There will only be one. That’s done. And now the pink brooch. No! - It’s... - You’re right. The necklace. Mama, is it a good thing or a bad thing? But, my child, what do you mean? Every girl will have a groom. Will it be like being a fish caught in a net? Or is it something beautiful? Like... Like when a secret chamber opens. It’s wonderful to be in love. Onward! You see that? All roses are banned from the Rose Kingdom. Please, why do you keep staring? Worthless flowers. They should be throwing sausages. She shouldn’t get married yet. Eliška, please... Your Majesty agreed that only a swift marriage and leaving the kingdom would lift the curse. In two weeks the princess will turn seventeen. Yes, I know. Do you like him? - I do. - Hm? Then let’s go. It is a great honour and a joy to welcome your Majesty in the Rose Kingdom, and we kindly thank you for accepting our invitation. Allow me to introduce you to Princess Růženka. We both, like our sons, were burning with impatience, to greet the rulers of this most beautiful country. The successor to the throne of the Midnight Kingdom, Prince Jiří! And our younger son, Prince Jaroslav. Milord, this is the Rose Kingdom, but I haven’t seen one single rose bush. Because they’re only annual plants. We will plant some new ones, soon. And this is where we keep our wild bear for the hunt. Your Majesty, this way, please. - A real, untamed bear? - Indeed. Our hunter caught it, recently. A bear? That’s great! Your Majesty, could I ask you for a favour? It is granted beforehand, prince. Thank you, your Majesty. I would like to fight the bear. - Excuse me? - Say what? Not again... Do you like wrestling with bears, Prince? It’s not that hard, for someone who is courageous. - Prince, we cannot risk... - Don’t worry. This isn’t my first bear, nor will it be my last. Besides, my parents can confirm this. Can he really win from the bear? Always. It only takes steel nerves, iron fists, and the swiftness of a leopard. And you have all of that, Prince? In abundance, Princess. Wonderful! My compliments! - In that case, go ahead. - Please... - We’ll just watch. - Thank you, your Majesty. I’m sure that watching me battle the beast will be a thrill for all of you. I always find fighting a beast a thrilling experience. Well, that’s annoying. Excuse me for a moment. I need to go and get changed. - Get my servant Matěj. - Very well, your Highness. Of course, your Highness. Excuse me. Please, continue. I admire your motherly bravery, dear Anežka – - letting your son wrestle with a bear. - At first we were afraid, but we got used to it. Brachu, pour me some more! - Here you go. - Thanks. Ah! There it is! That smell! It’s absolutely mouth-watering! - Just take a look at it! - Matěj, Prince Jaroslav wants you. - Oh, just one moment. - Immediately! - All right, all right. - Get up! - Kuchtík, watch my plate! - Oh, you greedy pig! Your horse is used to holding a sharp trot. Oh, they couldn’t talk the prince out of fighting again? - Matěj! - I know, he won’t listen to anyone. Right, I’ll go after lunch. - No, you’ll go right now. - At least some chicken for on the way? No. No one has to know about your journey. You have to be back in the morning, even if you have to wear out your horse. - Understood. Not even a little bite? - No. Not even a bite. Ladies... May I ask what ailments you’ve had before, Princess? Ahem... Well, it’s... What doesn’t kill you, makes you stronger. I can proudly say that I’ve bravely overcome many severe diseases, and they all made me strong as steel. And now? You couldn’t find a healthier Prince than me. As a boy, I’ve had all known diseases, And even a few unknown diseases. You have no idea, Princess, how terrible they can be. - Well, everyone gets ill, sometimes. - But I often had a cold and a cough. - Me too! - Don’t say that, Princess. It can’t be compared with my suffering! I almost died from it! - Isn’t that so, mama? - What? Of course, Prince. And you survived? I did. - Is this the shortest way? - No, but it is the nicest. Because it’s dangerous and mysterious out here. Let’s go. Here it is. Aren’t you going to be afraid, Princess? Do you hear that? - Dogs. - Hm. They’re already greeting me. But wait a minute, they’re pretty wild. I need to calm them down. She’s still a child, don’t you think? I’ll rule these lands myself. You may come. Hm? What are you doing with those dogs, Princess? I know I shouldn’t. If the huntmaster only knew, he would complain with my father. Let’s play. Come here. He’s over there. Are you in charge of the bear? - At your service, your Highness. - He mustn’t eat anything from now on. I want him mean and hungry, tomorrow. As you wish, your Highness. Come in. This is for keeping quiet. - But what do you mean? - You’ll find out. This will be yours, if everything goes to plan. But what kind of things, your Highness? You’ll see. What’s that? I don’t know, probably some echo. - Psst! - What? - Come with me. - What? Those are the Prince’s orders. One moment! And he told you to bring me some food, didn’t he? - I haven’t eaten for two days! - Come. Please don’t tell me anything. Yesterday, there were a thousand sausages, and what do I get now? A dry potato pancake! I’d rather starve to death. You’ve lost weight again, Matěj! Are you surprised, your Majesty? With all this, I don’t get to eat. You’re right, you haven’t had lunch today. Lunch? I didn’t drink or eat a thing for days, Prince. - Like the bear, you need to stay hungry. - Why so? Prince Jiří wants it. You’ll have to be wild from hunger. Well, that won’t be a problem. And please ask your brother not to hurt me like last time. Could you please ask him that? - What are you getting at? - I’m not getting any younger. You want him to know that he fought you and not the bear? Maybe. There’s no shame in that. I’m no easy push-over, either. Prince Jiří does not cheat. He mustn’t know. He needs to keep his confidence, otherwise he’ll be sick. Oh, he needs his confidence. You like secrets, don’t you, Jaroslav? I don’t know what you mean, Princess. Perhaps when your brother is wrestling with the bear. He was so weak from his illnesses, that everyone was letting him win – with fencing, shooting, and horseback riding... So the Prince got so used to being invincible, that he decided to fight bears. You see? And ever since, I’ve been doing this kind of thing. - He doesn’t know that your costume...? - He mustn’t know! If he knew, he would lose his royal self-confidence. - You stitched it at the back? - Yeah. Right, then stitch on the head. Nice and tight. Good grief, he has a dagger! Yes, I gave it to him. But why? Why not? He’ll be fighting a bear. What have you done? - I’m going over there, he cannot stab him! - Sit down! The dagger has a blade as soft as wax. I think the bear will have groom for lunch. That skin looks too wide on him. - Don’t you think Jiří will notice? - Please, Jiří? Oh, come on. So what’s his whole trick about? We are tricking him. He really thinks he’s fighting a bear. He does it to impress you. Bravo! I’m glad they don’t want me to play an eagle. I won’t be able to keep up in the air. - Are you bleeding? - What? Show me. You do see anything? Take a look. Well? I don’t get it. You’ll go through the forest, around the bushes, across the clearing and over the dam of the pond. Princess, would you be so kind as to record the time? Please remember how many times you have to turn the hourglass. And the prize for the winner? The winner may kiss me. Then I’m going first. Princess, attention... Go! Would you like your brother to win? I’m a worse rider. And what if you’re not worse? You might just say that to make him feel invincible. Faster! Faster! Faster! Faster! Faster! Faster! Faster! Faster! Faster! Perhaps that’s how it should be. A future king shouldn’t lose his self-confidence. But I want you to win. Time! Get ready, brother. Well? I turned exactly twice. Right. Attention... Go! Part of our wedding planning should of course include knightly games. Hm... Faster! Faster! Faster! Faster! Faster! Faster! Turn it around, Princess. It’s not there yet. What do you mean? Jaroslav is almost back. - He’s probably faster than you, Prince. - Nonsense. Faster! Faster! Faster! Look out! Oh, no! Get the horses, we need to help him. Grab the horse! Hold him by the bridle. And the prize for the winner, Princess? Look at that! That’s your fault. Right, let’s have a bite to eat, Prince. Why did I ride? - Say what? - I should’ve stayed home. Oh, well... Come on, Prince. Your brother needed to win from someone. - But, Matěj... - Oh, I like it here. They have this wonderful chef. Just look how he cooked this delicious tongue! Why did you bring all that food? What do you mean? It’s all pure and good things for you, Prince, in case you wake up hungry, like that one night. That was eight years ago. Since then you’ve been bringing me this pile of food. And we’re guests here. Okay, we’re guests here. But to decline this mulled wine and warm ham, that would certainly offend our host, wouldn’t it, Prince? Perhaps it doesn’t really count, but you also drank some from his pond, right? - Such a disgrace. - Oh, come on. You managed to save the boy. You call that a loss? You should be used to losing from him. But this time someone is grateful to you. - The Princess? - No, the gardener Jakub. That was his boy. I can tell you in detail what the princess thinks. First of all, there is no question whether you could beat me or not. - Did she say that? - She didn’t have to say that. But the Princess is afraid that you might try some foolishness again, tomorrow, during the engagement ceremony. The... The engagement will be tomorrow? Why postpone it? We already kissed. It would be best if you left. - I’ll talk to father. - No, I will explain to father. - But why do you want me to leave? - I didn’t say that I wanted to. The Princess? What can I do? I want to please her. Prince! 120 chickens were slaughtered for the engagement feast. And three dozen ducks! Pack my stuff and feed the horses well. Right, they deserve some nice food as well. They butchered about twenty piglets and put them on the barbecue. But we’re leaving tonight. No... Prince, no! You wouldn’t have the heart! I would. Then you wouldn’t have the stomach! Why aren’t you sleeping? When I close my eyes, I see him in front of me. And I want to cry a bit. - Cry a bit and laugh a lot? - Hm... - And you keep thinking about him? - Hm... And everything feels nicer and new when you’re with him? How do you know? You love him, Růženka, and that’s a blessing, a great blessing. I liked him from the first moment, but when he almost drowned, - avoiding to hurt that boy... - What are you talking about, Růženka? - That was Prince Jaroslav. - That’s who I like. Say what? - But you cannot have Jaroslav. - And why not? Jiří will become King. Only he can take you to his castle as his bride. But I don’t care about his castle. But you must get out of here! You cannot stay here! Růženka! There... They say that wisdom belongs to old age and love to youth. But sometimes love has to be dealt with wisely. Therefore I couldn’t deny my son Jiří’s request to help him find his bride to be, and the future Queen of the Midnight Kingdom. I have accepted her with great enthusiasm, and I kindly ask you now to listen to what he has to say. Several times in my life I was completely happy – when I could sit on horseback for the very first time, when I fired my first arrow, and when I conquered my very first bear. But the greatest happiness fills me, now I may ask for the hand of the Rose Kingdom’s heiress. But I cannot marry you, Prince. - I don’t love you. - Princess... Růženka... I know what you want to tell me – That I am cursed, that I should marry as soon as possible. I know! But I do not love you, Prince. I don’t want you! My friends... Baron... - Do something. - Your Majesty! You see? Exactly what I told you. - We should declare war on them. - Be quiet, you fool! And I don’t have repeat, that the Princess is in grave danger. We mustn’t forget about that. Throughout the castle, the park, the garden, there mustn’t be one single pointed object. You see? A hedgehog. He’s going on a journey. I think we’ll manage fine eating without a fork. Well said, Baron. Well said. Růženka... Růženka, watch out! Can’t you see those sharp bones? Take it away. - The cook is a crook! - We all need to be careful. And we must never forget. - Did you write that down? - Yes, sir. Show me that. Here you go. Allow me, Baron. Come on, honey bees. You have stings, so you could cause trouble around the castle. - Take them far away. - Don’t worry, I’ll take them across the border, to my brother. Don’t wait up for me, tonight. But what if we cannot protect Růženka? We will. We must. Don’t you remember that old lady? “Love is stronger than death.” But she fell in love with the wrong one. Hey... Don’t be afraid. They are from him. Where is he? He’s closer than you can imagine. These are roses! From Jaroslav. Baron, come here, we have to... More. And now I am Queen, little sister. Children! Children, I brought you something! Bětuška? Children! Daddy has returned! Bětka... Children! Bětuška! Honzíčko... Sheep! Buy my lovely sheep! Pigeons! Smoked fish! Smoked fish! Wonderful smoked fish! Don’t touch those! You’re not buying anyway. How do you know, whether I buy some or not? Do you know who I am? - Matěj the Scrounger! - Yeah, yeah, yeah... - Also known as Fake Penny! - Well, all right... Good sir, do you like the taste of lovely apples? - I do, but not these ones. - Please, try one. For free? Free ones are tasty. - Can I have two? - Sure. Say, do I know you from somewhere? I need to talk to the Prince. Why? Well? Hey, I asked you why. It’s because of our Princess. I have to talk to the Prince. Can you grunt like a pig? Well... Well, do you hear that? You know what? Tonight I’ll pour a nice drink, and then I’ll make a pile of sausages. - Come. - But you... Start cooking some turnips, for with the black pudding. - Stop, Matěj! - What’s wrong? - What are you doing? - I just bought a pig. - You can hear him, can’t you? - Let us take a look at him. Have you never seen a pig before? What? I paid money for a pig, and they put a man in there! What’s going on here? I can’t do anything with that! I’m going to complain! Why have you come to the castle? Talk! I won’t be talking to you. I want to talk to the Prince. You say you’re from the Rose Kingdom. How dare you set a foot in here! Please forgive me a thousand times. I came here, because... only his Highness the Prince can free our Princess. Because... love is stronger than death. I don’t think that this princess ever felt a great love for me. Not for you, Your Highness. But for you. How do you know? How dare you? Lock him up for a few days! How dares he? - Your Majesty... - Get him out! - Save the princess! - Out! - Save our kingdom! - Out, I said! Would you like to prove that you’re braver than I am? What are you talking about? I’m going to save the princess. You fool, she is cursed. She’ll never wake up. - But I can save her. - You’re not going anywhere! You can’t tell me what to do. But I’m the eldest! But I love Růženka. Jaroslav, I’m locking you up in your room! Just until you come to your senses! - Show me. - I brought dinner, as always. - All right? - Go ahead. - Do you have it? - I do. Wait, Prince. You first need to gain some strength. Here, have some. My Prince... Matěj... Quiet. Don’t let go. - Matěj? - Yeah? How do I climb a rope? How to climb a rope? Well, you need to hold on with your hands, and also with your legs. And then slowly, step by step, you go down. - Show me. - But I... - You go first. - I... Prince, think it through! I came through that door and must leave through it again. They’ll be suspicious. They’ll know I’ll be in here for too long. Oh... - Prince, just be careful. - Matěj... - What? - I’m scared. I don’t blame you. It’s so high. Come back inside. - Wait. - For what? Prince, don’t do it! Nobody is forcing you to! - Let me go! - Prince, wait! - Wait downstairs for me. - You’re too young to die! Enjoy your meal, my Prince. Enjoy. It’s me. Well, Prince... I didn’t think you could do it. - Me neither. - This way. Hey, you! Yoo-hoo! Well, that’s a bummer, Prince. The ferryman is snoring away, and his boat is gone. What do we do? We’ll swim. Do you know how to swim? - No. - Well, you see? But you’ll teach me. Right... Fine. First, you’ll have to take off your clothes. Slower, two, three... One, two, three... Two, two, three... - Matěj? - What? Don’t tell me that this will keep me above water. What? Sir, that’s a fact! Come, let’s try it in the shallows. You’ll see! Well? Be brave, Prince. Come on. Put on a smile, and hop. What is it? - Matěj? - Yes? If I start drowning, you’ll jump in to get me, won’t you? Me? Not me, Prince! I can’t swim! - Like this? - Prince, don’t do it! Prince, stay above water and breathe! Prince! - Wait! Wait! Hold on! - Matěj! Hold on, Prince! Move around, don’t just stay still! Right! This will do. Prince, hold on! Grab this... Prince, grab this! Courage, Prince! Come closer and grab this! I’ll pull you out! - Matěj... - What is it? - I’m swimming! - Say what? - You see? One, two, three... - I can swim! Matěj! We made it. Good. Just a bit further. - Give me your hand, I’ll help you. - All right. What? Here’s your shirt. Prince, look how very strange. - Listen, Matěj... - It’s so weird. Why didn’t you tell me you can’t swim? Well, you never asked me, Prince. You just wanted me to teach you how to swim. And now you know! - One, two... - Let’s go. It’s like a jungle. It must be somewhere over here. Prince, why here? There are better places where we could look. Prince? - Matěj, this is it! - Where? Follow me. I’d rather wait here for you, Prince. Come. Well, here we go. Do you hear that? Over there, Prince. Prince, we have to stop. We can’t go any further. But don’t blame yourself; you did what you could. On the contrary, you have shown great courage. What are you doing? What? - What are you doing there? - We’ll deepen the ditch, so the water... With your sword? That’s tough work. Work? That might be more important than courage. Get me a shovel. A shovel? Sure. Oh, I should’ve kept working for the miller. But no, that looked like hard work to me. The devil lured me into the service of this gentleman. Give me that. Thank you. - Thank you, Prince. - You’re welcome. Keep digging. I can’t do that, I have a back pain. The slightest physical strain will... Oh, some exercise will do you good. Come on. - Prince... - What is it? Look. That’s terrible. - Matěj! - Yes? Come here, we’ll break it. - It flows! - Matěj! - Prince, it’s flowing! - Matěj, it’s working! Like I said, the water will be drained! Prince, we’ll get there! Watch your head. Watch your head, Prince. - Prince! - What? - I bet there are more of those. Yuck. - Let’s go. Look. There. Quiet, Prince, quiet. If they wake up, then we’re done for. Let’s get out of here. Prince, look how my heart is racing. You see? - I’m gonna faint. - Let’s go. It’s the huntmaster. Look how he’s sleeping. Come. Matěj! - Matěj! - Yeah, yeah... - Come on! - I just grabbed an apple. - Get up there. - Who, me? Yes, you! Prince, who will stay here and protect you? Don’t get angry, but we haven’t eaten in two days. Matěj! Prince, the princess is not here. I’ve searched everywhere. - Also in the attic? - In the attic even twice. Not a trace. But please don’t send me again into the dungeon. - I was there. - You were there? Matěj! - Matěj! - Yes? Here! We already searched this spot, but the princess isn’t here. Yeah, that may be true, but it’s a nice spot to search. For example, these flowers... I know. It’s a clue! Come. I’m coming, Prince. Matěj? Pfew... That was really scary. Prince, let’s leave this place. Someone is trying to kill us, Prince! I’m telling you, Prince, let’s get out of here! Help me! Hey, you! Stop! You there! Wait, lady! I’m talking to you! Růženka? Růženka? Wait! I said, stop and answer me! What are you doing here? Stop! Why aren’t you asleep? Růženka... Jaroslav! - Bětka! - Father! Children! Come here! Yuck! I said a little bit! - Baron, I don’t know what... - What is this nonsense? Right, where did we stop? Show me exactly where. Where is Růženka? Stop! I said, stop! I’ll catch you anyway, so just stop, lady! - You want me to hunt you down? - Hey, what is all this? Are you going to eat me? Don’t mind me, I won’t bite you. I swear, I don’t bite. Don’t worry, I’m against biting. Believe me, I’m against biting. Down! - Not you. You get up. - Thank you. What are you doing here, man? Sir, you won’t believe me, but here I’m to free the princess. Long live Prince Jaroslav! Long live! Look, my parents. Baron, organize the wedding! Right away, Your Majesty! Right away. Man, do something! Cursed! Your Highness, I can finally have some chicken now, right? May I? I’ll just go ahead. THE END Subtitles by Vahlto
