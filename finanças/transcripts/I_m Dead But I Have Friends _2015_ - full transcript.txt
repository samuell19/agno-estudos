Do you know the story of Pete Best? He was the first drummer... with the Beatles. He was the best looking band member. That's why they through him out. They were jealous. After that he trained as a baker. His whole life people asked him the question: 'Hey Pete, is it true that you nearly became a rock star?' 'Aren't you sad to have lost your friends?' From then on he was called the 'unluckiest men on Earth'. We Innus would have really liked to meet him. We love stories about rockers. You want some more? Still not enough for you? Your pants are on fire. We'll give you what you want! M?lanie, give me the same. Guys, I'm done in. I have knives in my throat! You got hoarse. That sucks. - Yeah, I know. - Stop talking. It's not good for your... In your throat... - Vocal cords. - Yes, your vocal cords. - Spike. - Yes? Where were you when Jip?'s mike gave in? Where? We didn't see you! Let him go. - We didn't see you! - It wasn't my fault. - It wasn't? - No. - Did you say you were sorry? - I'm sorry, Yvan. Have you heard Jip?'s voice? Ouch! Stop! M?lanie, all that is on him. And bring Jip? a hot drink. OK, fine. Let me go now. So, that's it? You're leaving? Sacramento, San Jose, Los Angeles... 12 dates, my man. - Seattle. - That's cool. Too bad you left the band. Hey, you. Come here. Let's dismantle the drums. Wait. Let's take a picture first. All together. Old drummer and new drummer. Old guard and new guard. I'll put it on Facebook. - Take a picture. - Me? - Yes, you. Press button. - Put it on Facebook. Robertson Brothers? What's this? - You have a brother? - I have a sister. My friend and I do some dubstep. Jip? would like you to do other things other than dubstep. I always give 100 % when I play. Right, Jip?? We won't give 100 % in Los Angeles. We must give 150 %. Jip? writes some fast stuff. You have to play fast, like... OK. I think I got it. Hello. Eight beers, please. Hey, I know you! - You're Souka's cousin. - No. - You look like her. - I do? There he goes. I don't know how he does it. He's a machine. It's dubstep. I do it with a friend. Listen. It's cool. Oh, yeah! With samurai sauce, please. - Hey, guys! - What? No fries for you. We have Jip?'s chili. Have some respect. Just one! They're good! You should come. Come on! Jip?! Come on! These are the best fries in the world! Yvan! Just one! I didn't take any meat. I didn't say anything. You never played in Los Angeles? How come? You had huge success with... Pickup Pitch. We should've gone. We were invited and all. - We just didn't go. - Why not? - When was that? - 1988. - 1988! Holy cow! - 1988? Hey, guys! Wim! Yvan! Jip?! Where is this guy? Jip?! I'M DEAD BUT I HAVE FRIENDS Hey. Come on! Excuse me. I'm sorry. Excuse me. Sorry. Frideborg. She doesn't speak French. Look. That's Florent Pagny. Is that a friend of Jip?'s? No. That's his brother. Florent Pagny's brother? Jesus, Nico. That's his nickname. His girls are all grown. What is he doing? He's leaving? "Jean-Pierre..." The ceremony is today, but it's over now. Oh, no! The ceremony's over. Look. "Jean-Pierre Decoster." What's going on? You spoke with him. His brother told me it was today, at noon. He even sent me an SMS. Please leave the crematory. - What's wrong? - That son of a bitch. He did the funeral and then took off. - Who? - That fucker, Florent Pagny. - No way. He'll come back. - No, he won't. He was already like this when we were 12. - I'm sorry, but... - You shut up! - You're calling? - Yes. - I'll talk to him. - Wait. - Come on, let me talk to him. - Here. Jean-Jacques? Hi, it's Yvan. I'm calling you because... You're a son of bitch. Yeah, you're a real scumbag. You have to be twisted to sabotage your brother's funeral. Only a son of a bitch would do that. I'll go to your place and smash your face. And you can tell your stupid wife to get herself a wig, because I'm going to rip her hair out! You asshole! Hey! Put that coffin back. We're doing that ceremony. Put our friend's coffin back in its place. That's not your friend, that's an old lady. - That's not Jip?. - Gentlemen. Gentlemen, please. You can't be here. That's enough now. Leave. You'll have to give us our friend. - I have a very busy day... - I'll give you a busy day. Listen to me. The urn's already gone. It's gone? What do you mean, it's gone? Where's the urn? We just want to talk. OK? We'd like to see Jean-Jacques. Wait for me Where time is forever Wait for me How come a crappy musician like him makes such a lot of money? We live in a world that gets crappier every day. Your eyes in my eyes Just like before Not so long ago We used to sing The same notes, the same chords Not so long ago We still believed in our love Don't go and blame me You are wrong Watch out! Wait for me! - Give me the urn, Wim. - No. You've always been a dork. You've always made shitty songs. Bad, ugly. - What did you say? - Ugly, shitty songs. I'll kill that guy! Hurry up. Ouch! Go, go, go! Damn it! Those losers. We got it! We did it. He gave it to you? He steals the funeral, we steal the urn. That's a good one. - You are out of your minds. - Great! That's one ugly urn. I mean, it's horrid. I have this. This is much better, huh? Yes. That's a good idea. What are you going to do now? We have to be in LA on the 22nd. We'll be there. You're going anyway? Jip? worked his ass off. We're doing it. I'm with you, Yvan. - Who's going to sing? - Jip?. We'll put him behind a mike and that's it. Rock n' roll. - Are you kidding? - No. That's stupid. The band is over. Come on, open your eyes. Pierre, picture this. His ashes on a stool, sitting behind a mike. It can work. It can really work. - Come with us. - No. - Please. - No. And there you go. A brand new suit for our buddy. Look, Yvan. Doesn't he look beautiful? Yeah. A beer for Jip?, please. Yes. - We should get going too. - Pierre, wait. Look. Come with us to LA. You should go. It'll be good for you, Pierre. The flight is tomorrow morning. I'd go if I were you. I have a hundred meetings, I'm releasing three albums. Pierre... Do it for Jip?. OK, fine! Goddamn it. I'm in. - Yeah! The three musketeers! - Wait. - What? - My back. - Right. Sorry. - Damn... Knock, knock. Jip?! It's us! Open up! We're here! Stop it. Don't be a fool. We've woken him up before. Sure we did. Yeah. His place is as tidy as always. - Who'll take care of his things? - Not his brother. Take your guitars and then we're off, OK? It's as if he were here. Look. It's Jip?'s chili. Nobody touched it. That's sad, isn't it? He prepared it specially for us. Come on. Wim, you can't eat that. You'll get sick. If it's cooked, we're good. OK? Got it? - OK. - OK, fine. - Who wants some? - I'll have one. Who's that guy? I don't know him. I'm sorry, I... My name is Dany. I mean, that's how my colleagues call me. You know, Buck Danny. The comic books. Dany, Buck Danny. It's an aviators' thing. - The ashes! - Easy. Hey! "Captain Karim Azout". Look. That's a Nazi thing. What? That's not "a Nazi thing". That's the NATO logo. - Who wakes him up? - Me. I've always dreamed of hitting a soldier. Not too hard. Feeling better? So, who are you? I'm... Jip?'s best friend. Really. I understand your reaction. But... Jip? and I... We... What? We were together. - What? - Yeah, what? We were together. - No! You have to be kidding! - That's a good joke. Picture Jip?! With a soldier! No... I mean, come on! Five years now. That's him. This is unbelievable. I just... I mean... Jip?... with a guy! Seriously! That's enough, guys. Right. Well... I'm going to leave you now. No. You're staying. We have Jip?'s chili. You should eat some. You have to. Present arms! Come on. There's more left. - Here. - No, thank you. - You don't drink? - No. Come on. Have a toast with us. To Jip?! To Jip?. - To Jip?. - Hey. Guys, we're good. I got the coke. - Hi. - Bon app?tit. - Nico. - Hi. I love your Village People look. You know, Christine and I thought you were the gay one. You have to admit it's been a while since you... I mean, we haven't seen you with a girl for years now. Not every guy who hasn't screwed in 10 years is gay. Besides, what do you know? I'm a low-key guy. Anyway, this is just strange. He had a soldier boyfriend! Gay or not, soldier or not, I don't care. What really bugs me is that he didn't say anything about it. I hear you. Damn. 960 euros for a one-way ticket... I want you! Are you OK, guys? Of course they are. They've been through worse. I'm sorry... I don't understand. If it's cooked, we're good. I think I better leave. Dany, you can't just leave like that. No, no way. Here. Take this. Why isn't the pilot throwing up? He's a soldier. Those dudes are trained to eat their puke. That's a cool band. - He loves that album. - Yeah, I know. So, how did you two meet? Jip?... When I met him... It had been raining nonstop for months. Everybody was feeling down. I knew a place where it was always sunny. He said, "take me there". I said, "OK". During the initial climb, I increased power. I was flying an aircraft that can reach Mach 2,04. That's 2,173 km/h. I started with a short straight line, to get to Mach 1. Then we entered a cloud formation. We went through it. It was a cumulonimbus. We were shaken up, but I stayed the course. Then, I geared up. And a couple of minutes later... I will never forget his smile when we landed. That's like, wow... Have some. There's been an accident. I am so happy that Jip? had a boyfriend. I thought he was all alone. No, we... Yvan. We have... Buck Danny and I have this awesome idea. He could come with you, do the ceremony in Los Angeles. Are you out of your mind? Yvan, that's not a bad idea. He could come. We might as well take M. Mathieu. You'd be happy either way. Who's Mireille Mathieu? I don't know all your girlfriends. I like the idea of doing a ceremony in Los Angeles. It's really... Dany, wait. We're not doing a "ceremony". - We're touring. - Together? Wonderful. Just the band. You're not coming. Yes, I am. Someone has to take care of Jip?. Have you seen that urn? If you don't have an official authorization, the customs.... I'm a military man. I know what to do. It might make sense in your mind, but... Hey, guys! We're doing a tour, not a ceremony. All the more reason, then. I want to go to his concerts. I want to be with him. Yvan, if he were his wife, you'd be good. OK, so, firstly, he's not his "wife". Secondly, I'm sorry, but we don't know you. And thirdly, we never take girlfriends. That is a rule. Why don't you share? Share what? Jip?. Jip? was living a double life. I would go fifty-fifty. One half for Big Bear, one half for you. Makes sense, huh? That's a good idea, Sofie. Hold on. - He can't be serious. - Sorry. He's very well capable. Come on. Listen to me. We'll split in half. Fifty-fifty. You take your part, I take mine. And then, it's over. OK? Hey, baby. Want some coke? What is this? What are you doing? Rock n' roll, my friend. - You're insane! - Let go of me, asshole! That guy, there. The one with the cap. - What? - The guy with the cap. That's Pete Best. Who's Pete Best? He's the fifth Beatle. He was kicked out in 1962. Right before Love Me Do. He's the most unlucky man in the world. He gets inside plane, we crash. I'm sure. Relax. That's not Pete Best. You're freaking out. He's not Pete Best. Relax. We'll be fine. Don't worry. I'm... I'm fine. Oh, shit! Yvan, I forgot my passport! It's in my jacket. - Oh, for God's sake! - Damn it! Take a cab. You have time. - I won't make it. - You will. Quick! - Oh, no. - What? - Can I have 50 euros? - Man, you're a leech. - Oh, God! Pierre. Sir. Can you open it, please? There you go, sir. - What is this? - It protects the guitar. The pressure in the plane... This cracks and... That's why I put the... - What...? - He wants to know what this is. Oh, these are spices. Tandoori. We have an Indian friend in Los Angeles. He doesn't have anything like this. So we buy it here and take it to him. Best tandoori in Schaerbeek. Over there. Come on. Move. They're going to close the gate. Those are spices. Nothing illegal. One thing can't be two things at the same time. Cocaine is cocaine, or it's not cocaine. Alright? Tandoori spices are either tandoori spices or not tandoori spices. Do we agree? OK. Can I have a minute? Tandoori. Passengers of Brussels Airlines flight number 2309 to Los Angeles, please proceed immediately to gate A50. We are now closing the gate. - OK? - Yeah, I'm fine. Come on. Hurry up. Wait! My jacket! Where the hell's Nico? I was scared I'd do this tour without you. Give me that. I can't believe you. Thanks, Pierre. That's one motivated soldier. Pierre, can you see if Pete Best's over the plane? Wim, Pete Best is not "over" the plane. Hey, listen to me. I'll be clear with you. You are not in the band. You're not coming. We get to LA, you pull a 180 and go back to your base. We gather the ashes, we do that concert, we do a ceremony, and then I go back to my base. This man isn't traveling in first class. Sir, please go back to your seat. This is it... This is it... We lost the drummer. We ate the singer. We're all going to die. - Relax. - We're all going to die. Pass me your GSM. I'll call Nico. Don't do that. It's dangerous. - Hey... - Don't do it. Calm down. Wait for me Jip?. Jip?? Mom! We're going to die! Fasten your seatbelts! I told you... Pete Best is the most unlucky man in the world. He's going to receive you now. Go ahead. They're here, sir. Anne-Marie, turn me around. Gentlemen, congratulations. This will go down in the history of Quebec aviation. I have received photos of the cockpit. Looks like Fukushima. I had never seen anything like it. Captain Azout, who let you in the cockpit ? I did. He's an ass mate... classmate. I was going to come out. But then she arrived with the lunch for the pilots, and I had quite a bad reaction. A "bad reaction"? You threw up on the captain. - No. - No. That was me. Oh, it was you, captain Van Beek? And who threw up on the assistant? That was me. OK. Who threw up first? I'm a bit lost here. Actually, Mr. Azout threw up first, on the pilots' veal stew. Then, I... Then, I threw up on his puke. I wanted to go out, but she was standing at the door. I... It's not my fault, sir. I can't stand the smell of vomit. Even the word makes me nauseous. The smell is just... I tried... but the plate... The plate fell down. - It's not my fault. - Calm down. It fell where? On my back, sir. OK. So... You threw up on her and she threw up on the plate. And the plate... The plate landed on Van Beek's back. And you, Van Beek, threw up on Lokhart. Am I correct? Yes, sir. Who threw up on the flight deck, then? This airport is too small for long-haul planes. We'll have to build a much longer runway for your plane. Given how much that will cost us, expect to see an army of lawyers and experts. Thank you for your cooperation. You see, we really need those seats on the next flight. It's very important. We're only three people. The plane to Los Angeles will be here any minute now. Sit down. You said that two hours ago. Do something, or you'll end up cleaning restrooms. Sir, you better watch your mouth, or you won't be getting on that plane at all. - Bitch! - Good God. Did you tell the promoters that Jip?... What did they say? The promoters. Do they know he's dead? - That's a detail. - A detail? A detail... I can't believe this. Wait! Wait! Big Bear will be playing with you, me, Jip?, Wim and Nico. Give me that. Give it to me! Goddamn! I'm impressed. - You had quite a busy agenda. - Yes. Yes. We had concerts in Calais, Tourcoing, Nice, and also in Metz, Nancy. What are you going to do? We'll do that tour. We promised. I mean, after the tour? Good grief, Yvan! I'm in shock, too. I can't believe we lost Jip?, but damn... This is just wrong! - You will have to accept... - Accept what? - You want to say it? Say it. - Yes. - I'll say it. - Go ahead. He's gone. Mourning is stupid. It's something capitalism invented to make money when people die. So, fuck mourning. I'm against that. Sometimes, you don't have a choice. I do have a choice. I choose not to change anything. It's always been like this and it won't change. Jip? is here. I can feel him. I don't want to brush him away. Is there any chance I can smoke... No, sir. No exit. But I wasn't allowed to smoke on the plane... Hold on. You'll be taking off soon. Taking off? Ladies and gentlemen, all passengers of flight US 751 to Los Angeles, please proceed to gate A... Help? I Need Somebody? Yesterday? All my troubles seemed... Yesterday? Troubles? - Michelle. - Ma belle. I'm the eggman. I am the Walrus. John Lennon We're about to take off. Wim! What are you doing? - Wim! - Where are you going? Wim! Hey, where are you going? I'll take the train. A train? I'll get him. No. I'm in better shape than you. Wait! Forget it. I'll go. Come on, help me. What are you doing here? Why are you going through his bag? I want the ashes. He can't be split up. Jesus Christ! Wim has the ashes. Excuse me! Could you...? I have to go to the station. Can I come with you? - Get in. I'll take you. - Thanks. Wim! We need to talk. I don't need you, OK? Thank you. Wim! Look at me in the eyes. We're going to get off this train, and everything will be OK. Just take my hand and follow me. - Wim, we're out. - No. Come on, Wim. We have to stay together. That's the only thing that matters. Wim, look. The odds of a plane crash are one in 4 million. Our plane already crashed. See? It already crashed. Wim, come on. Yvan is your best friend. You trust him. Take his hand. Do you trust him? - Then take his hand. - Come on. Take his hand. - Take his hand. - Come on. No, I can't. - I want to travel by train. - Take my bag. - Jump. - No, I won't jump. - Jump! - No! - Jump, Wim! - No! - Jump. - What? I can't. My knees hurt. - I can't believe this. Jump! - I can't! Throw the bag. - Where is this train going? - To Montreal. - Montreal? - Yes. Damn it, Wim. - Well? - Montreal. - When do we arrive? - Sorry? - When do we arrive? - Tonight. - Does the train make any stop? - It's an express. He'll think we're idiots. We'll be there in three days! I have to call Ravens. Pierre has my bag. I'll call him. Hello, this is Pierre. Leave a message after the beep. Pierre, listen, it's Yvan. I can't explain right now, but we're in trouble. - We're on train to Montreal. - Yvan. It's a Montreal bound train. He have to... Wait! Tell Ravens we're stuck in Las Vegas, and that we'll call him ASAP. Look, make something up. You're in charge now. It's a bit complicated for us. I trust you. Sort it out. Call me back, please. Bye, Pierre. What! Pierre's cell phone... is broken. The funeral. Oh, shit. Don't you feel betrayed by Jip?? - Betrayed? - Yes. You know... Him. Five years. He could've told us. Why? I don't tell everything either. I don't tell I play in another band. In Anvers. Really? We play on Monday nights. You too, in fact. You didn't say you slept with my wife, eight years ago. It's true. - Just once. - No details, please. My dear friend! Hey, that's mine. The ashes! The ashes! Shit! They're gone. Hey, it's going to be OK. - What's that? - Big John. Hamburger, cheese, bread. You're writing down the recipe? No. I'm writing a song. Oh. You're a singer? No. I'm a songwriter. And right now I'm writing a song. I love songs! Sing me a song. - I can't just sing. - Come on, sing. - But it's not... - Sing. - It's not ready yet. - It's just the two of us. - It's a draft. - Come on. Sing. OK, but it's not ready yet. - It's called Big John. - Big John. "A Big John with fries..." Wait. "A Big John with fries A blessing in disguise "Canada is beautiful And I'm staying for long "The sun in the back The river is black "And right in the middle Your face like a riddle" - It's rock. There's guitars... - You suck. I don't like it. You suck. - I know. - Sorry. I mean no insult. It's OK. I'm not used to writing. Do you want me to help you? - What's your name? - Marie-Soleil. - I can put "Marie-Soleil". - Yes. Why not? Sounds nice. Very rock n' roll. Now I need another pretty word. Marie-Soleil... God, I want to stay. Wow! That's beautiful. "God, I want to stay". - You like it? - Sing it. Let's see if it works. OK, so... "Tall and green pine trees My days are a bliss "And Marie-Soleil God, I want to stay" That's a good rhyme. - You think? - Yes. I love it. So, I'll keep this and cross out the beginning. I need an end, though. I would like you to look me in the eyes. I love the color of your eyes. - This is good... - It's strong. It comes from the North. What difference does it make? - You want some? - No, thanks. Oh well. Wim. - Wim, the sun. - I see it, yes. The sun's in the West, Wim. It's setting. We're going North. We're going North. We're going to see the Inuit. - Where are we going? - "To the Inuit's". We're not going to Montreal. Yvan... Yvan's going to kill me! He's going to kill me! I'm a dead man! So actually, you hopped on the first train you saw. You want some? Why not. Damn it, Wim! Careful, it's strong. It's strong. Dany. Honestly... I'm very happy I meet you. Me too. There's one tiny problem, though. - What is it now? - Your moustache. Your moustache is ugly. Seems like you're having a good time. - I guess you're hungry. - Wow! That's nice of you. Very nice of you. Doesn't happen very often, Yvan. - Dany. - Yes? Dany, look. Let's stop fighting over Jip?. He wouldn't have liked that. I agree. This isn't the ceremony you wanted, but you won't get anything better. That's the way it is. So, as soon as we get to Montreal... When we get to Montreal... You'll fly back to Brussels. Yvan. Let's get to Montreal, and I'll get on a plane back to Brussels. - OK. - OK. Perfect. Wim. Yes? Yes. As soon as we get to Montreal... You take a sleeping pill, we fly to Los Angeles and do that goddamn tour. As soon as we get to Montreal, we'll do anything you want. Anything you want. As soon as we get to Montreal. - OK. - Yes. OK. There you go. Life is beautiful. We're cool. Pass the joint. - It's strong. - Rock n' roll. You silly rednecks. You're a bunch of rednecks. Have you seen the sunset? Of course you haven't. Too much poetry for you, huh? - Did you see? It sets in the West. - Yes. OK, manneke. Come here for a second. Hey! - Rock n' roll, buddy? - Yes. - Yeah, rock n' roll. - Alright? - Where are we? - In Schefferville. Are we far from Montreal? We're 1000 km away from Montreal. Are you coming? Your friends are at my place. Yeah. That's a good idea. Hey! Rock n' roll, my friend! Welcome to Montreal! Alright, guys? Cool? You sure jerked me around. You took any old train. "Any old train". You're overreacting, Yvan. - We made a mistake... - Shut up, you! We're going to miss that tour. Are you happy now? - Relax. Enjoy the barbecue. - Relax? No, I won't relax! You keep screwing up, Wim! Never took the wrong train? Not in a situation like this. It was an important train. You've been on the wrong track several times. That explains it. - There. - What do you mean? Nothing. I mean nothing at all. - You're Mr. Flawless. - Look. - You have a problem? - No. - Say it, Wim. - No. - There is no problem. - Yes, there is. You're the problem. - Stop. - Say it now. There's a reason why we're here. - The three of us have a mission. - Say it. Don't answer, Wim. You're a selfish bastard, Wim! You've always been the last one to come and the first one to leave. No interest. You do your things on your own, like your band in Anvers. You're not a rocker anymore. You're a tourist. Come on, guys. Come again? A rock tourist, like all those old folks. - That was mean. - You think that's mean? If I'm a rock tourist... Then you're... The rock patrol. A pain in the ass. - A pain in the ass? - That's right. You're a pain. - You're always upset. - Not always. - I mean... - Sometimes. No one can talk to you. I don't talk to you anymore. Jip? wouldn't talk either. Did he tell you about Dany? - How do you explain that? - That's different. - It is. - It's not different. You're like a prison guard who keeps his shit secured. Yvan. Wim and I have made a decision. Yes. We spoke with Pierre. The tour is cancelled. That guy... Ravens... He wanted Jip? on tour. Jip? is dead, so no more tour. You heard right. It's over. It is over. Is anybody up there? So... we decided... that you and me, and Dany, are going to do a ceremony for your friend. We'll do it with a lot of respect and a lot of love. That's what we're going to do. OK? A nice ceremony. - Yes. - The three of us. - With a lot of love. - Yes. Of course. A nice ceremony. I'll give you a ceremony! - What are you doing? No! - There's your ceremony! No! No! This time, you've gone too far. You've gone too far. OK? That's right! Leave! Go fuck yourself! The chops, the sausages... Everything... And Jip?. - All this is my fault, somehow. - What? All this mess. We have known each other for 2 days... and you had a fight, the band exploded. No, no. It's... I'm going to tell you a Belgian story. It's a funny story, actually. There once was a scientist who made an invention. He invented a machine, a machine that was able to translate what dogs say. He was confident. "It's going to work. Do you have a dog?" And the dog went like... You know what the dog was saying? That's Yvan. Yes. I'm leaving. Alone. When someone shits on you, let me tell you, it's over. It's schluss. Hello. One beer, please. Hello, madam. Are these sleeping pills? Yes, sir. - Are they strong? - Very strong. I'll take two. And four beers, please. Budweiser. Watch out for bears Wait! Stop! Dany! Dany! - Come here! - What's he doing? - What are you doing here? - Come! - What? - I'm sorry. I was an idiot. I owed you an apology. You're right. We're not here by chance. Where's Wim? I don't know. He wanted to be alone. I'm leaving tomorrow. No! The three of us need to finish this. You screwed up everything, Yvan. Yes, I know. - Which way did Wim go? - What do I know? I have a car. Let's go find him. - You're a pain. - Come on, let's go. You won't introduce your friend? Dany. A friend. Marie-Soleil. Guys, we found Wim. - Where? - He's taking a seaplane. - Anybody here? - Yes. Hello, sir. I'm looking for a man with a beard. - Yes. - Where is he? He's already in the seaplane, over there. Yvan! Yvan! He's in the seaplane! No way! He's afraid of flying! Wim! Are you OK? - What is this? - Did you take those? - Wim. - Did you take those? Wim? Too bad Jip? didn't introduce us. I'd always wanted to meet you, Yvan. Always. And Jip?, too. He wanted that. - He even tried once. - When? Last concert of the Bus Cocks. You were drinking and talking, and drinking again. And then he said something. Remember? He said, "I love a man". You didn't say a word, Yvan. I thought he was talking about me. OK, so, here's the deal. Tomorrow, at dawn, the three of us leave. We take Jip?. Clark told me about a river in a beautiful prairie. Behind that prairie, there's a sacred mountain. I would like to... scatter him there. You're right. That's a good idea. Alright, Wim? Wim! Jip?. Rock n' roll, buddy! Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. That was Big Bear's last concert. And... I'm sorry about the singer. He's in a sachet. In a bag. Because... he's dead. But... Yeah. Thank you. Thank you very much. - See that curve over there? - Yes. Clark told me that after that curve... There's the pine, and then comes the river. He says it's a nice place. He'll be OK. - Right, Wim? - Yeah. He would've been proud of your performance. Yeah, it was cool. He always wanted to come to Canada. Rock n' roll, buddy.
