a Bartosz Konopka film How long, O Lord? Will you forget me forever? How long will you hide your face from me? How long must I take counsel in my soul? Consider and answer me, O Lord my God. Give light to my eyes, lest I fall into the sleep of death. You know why I came here, don't you? Where are my people? They're dead. Stop! What are you doing?! It's only a boat, a few planks of wood. Those planks could take you home. I don't have a home. Nor do you. There is nothing for us there. Everything is over there. Tell me, were you promised a reward for my head, bishop? There'll be no reward! The same sword hangs over us both! Come with me. It is your only chance. He will come here in a few months! You know that. Help me. Only together can we save ourselves. And all the people on this island. So? Now you know where we are? Let the earth rejoice... Let the many islands be glad! His lightnings light up the world; the earth sees... ... and trembles. The mountains melt like wax before the Lord... ...before the Lord of all the earth. Remember, show no fear. God is with you. And with me... Some wandered in desert wastelands, but they found no city where they could settle. They were hungry and thirsty, and their lives ebbed away. Some sat in darkness, prisoners suffering in iron chains, prisoners, because they had rebelled against Godâ€™s commands and they despised the plans of... - ... the Almighty. - Don't shout, talk to them. Why did they let us go free? Only they know why. We will go back there tomorrow. Will they give us something for this? Hey, the sack! They were here before us. Holy martyrs... I shall fear no evil, for Thou art with me. Your day will soon come. You must be strong. Why do I have to be strong? - You can see. - Why do I need to be strong? Perhaps it's better to be weak and poor? Like them? Doesn't rain from God fall equally on everyone? Why do you make all peoples blind? I knew such apostles of whom you speak. Look. Bones are all that's left of them. Pagans want to see someone better than them, someone who has the most powerful of gods behind them. They don't even understand your language. - You need something else here. - What? Tell me. I don't know yet. Look! I took off the mask of your god and nothing happened! Look, this is clay. Was I struck by lightning? Did anything happen? Where is the power of your Perun? Well? No lightning has struck me, see! This is clay, this is clay! This Perun of yours... he has no power... no power at all. I challenge you to a trial by fire. Open your eyes. Open your eyes. Shaman, I challenge you to a trial by fire. I would like to confess to you. Will you hear me? I see faces all the time. The faces of the people who died at my sword. I see them all the time. I pray that the faces of those whom my work has saved would show themselves to me as often, but it's not so. It is not. I only see two faces, of those I once knew. My father's and mine. I would like to forgive them... Forgive... Blessed are those who believe without understanding. I was afraid. What trick was that? It was no trick. Stay! We were supposed to save lives, not take them! Stay! It's what God wants. O Lord... O Lord... Accept the Shaman into Your Kingdom... Send an angel to lead him there... Forgive my pride... Forgive me... Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of God. Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy. Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted. Blessed are those who hunger for righteousness... Enough! I let you stay here, and you move around the island like it's yours! It is not yours yet! How do you know human speech? I know it. I know your speech. And your religion. I know what you want. How did you get here? I was a merchant. I lost everything at sea. And Perun was kind to me. He gave me a wife, a daughter, brothers, sisters. Why did you kill those who came before us? We didn't kill them. Disease took them. Apparently, your God didn't bless them. You're lying... Listen, priest, you're alive! You know why? Because I won't make the mistake the tribe from the bay made. They killed one of your priests. Before a year had passed, there was no trace left of them. And that wasn't God. They were slain by an army of men. No, no... I... I am patient. My people will tire of you and you'll go back to the water, to preach to the fish. You're right. We are fishermen. Your days... they are numbered, my friend. In a few months the king and his army will come here and then you will either greet him as a Christian prince or you will die. As bishop, I will have the authority to ordain the prince, so it is in your interests to accept the true God. Or remind yourself that you belong to his flock. You can build this church of yours. But you will never enter the village. Remember that you're only postponing the inevitable. And you remember that my patience has its limits. Only you understand me... He did this to you?! Only you can accept him. I've been praying for you... You are the prophet... My father won't listen to me... But I've seen the signs... I've seen the signs... You will lead us out of here and take us home. Tell me... Is it true that the king is coming here with his army? What are you doing?! What are you doing, eh? Is it so hard to concentrate? Look! You've spoilt their work! Not only are you the scum of the tribe, you're also ruining their work! Take him away! I don't want to see him! What Mokosas? Sorcery! Sorcery! What? What are you talking about? He's sick. Take him, help him. Do something! You're just hissing at me. They say it's your fault. My fault? Why? What have I done?! It's a punishment from Mokosas for building your temple. Nonsense! It's sorcery! Go away! Because our fear will arouse his anger. And the earth will take away the disease. It's a gift... From whom? Maybe from God... Or maybe the opposite? All hope lies in him... In whom? In the Mute. Tell him... that he knows where to look for me. You have a nice wife. Is this your way of helping them? You have nothing to say? So you can control your tongue, but not other things? - And your lips tell lies. - What about you? Let him speak! The prophet! Better in the language of people and angels! Come on, talk! Well? You imagine you're a saint, don't you? How proud! So you imagine... that you have the power to heal and to convert these people! Why is that? You're just playing with their heads! That's a terrible sin. He wants to help you build the temple. He does everything for you and for your God. He wants to be where you are! Who is 'he'? I understand everything, but who is 'he'? Tell me. Who do you mean? Him? The vagrant? You mean him? The Holy Mute? What? What are you saying? What are you saying? Tell me what you're saying! Well? I hate you. I'm scared of you and I hate you. You are not a man of God. You are a messenger of the devil. And who are you? How do you know what he wants to say? - Prahwe can feel it here! - Oh? And Willibrord feels it here! Stop! Stop! Don't you dare enter the sacred ground! Get away from here! Get back! Get out! And take away your gifts! I don't need anything from you! You'll end up like your gifts! You'll end up in flames! Away! Go away! Be gone! Be gone! Go away or I'll crush your skull. Go away or I'll crush your skull! Go away! Away! If your Kingdom will come... If I have no love... I am nothing... Oh God! Hear me! Do you hear me? I am nothing... ...nothing... ...nothing... Do not think about him now. You hear me? Do it for us. For me... No! No, no, no! Baptism given by a man without name or speech is not valid! Traitor! This is a sinner! Go back to your homes! Now! Away! Away! Karenga! Karenga! Take this witch away! This witch must be cleansed in holy fire! Get out of here, priest! Release her and get out! My son was still a child... when they made him a knight... I remember his face before the battle, when he said goodbye to me. He was so proud. He kissed my ring and said: "Father... I will not bring you shame." That was the last time I saw him. I recognised his body from the clothes. His face was unrecognisable. Such is life. Unfair. You cannot resurrect the dead. They remain dead. My life... It was... I had a heart of stone. And... I've felt something now, I don't want to lose that, as life then will make no sense. Back then, at the beach, I couldn't. Do you remember, by the sea? I was not able to. But I want to tell you one thing. I pray that you will understand... You've changed these people. And now you must... You must abandon them. Because you must flee. I beg you. Flee... Flee... My son, run away! Should I not hate those who hate you, O Lord? And despise those who rise up against you? Search me, God, and know my heart! Test me and know my thoughts! See if there is any grievous way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting! Give it to him when he arrives. I'm free. Light it! Let us pray. Our Father, who art in heaven, Hallowed be Thy name. Thy kingdom come Thy will be done on Earth as it is in Heaven, Give us this day our daily bread And forgive us... our trespasses, as we forgive those that trespass against us. Sire! Sire, you've come! Light of my eyes, joy of my heart! We've waited so long, sire! Sire, you are witness... to a miracle! A miracle of conversion and devout faith! It's a revelation of the Lord, seen in my church. Sire, if I told you what we've endured here... Where is my son? My son Jan? Have you killed him? Did he suffer? And you? What did you feel? That he was the last man I will kill. Give it to him. Your Excellency! You didn't ask "why". That's good. What were his last words? Did he repent? No, sire, he did not. It was he who inspired these people, who awakened the true God in them. He overcame me. And you, sire. He did? This is his work! He wanted to butcher me with a knife... Like a pig! It has no name, sire. Sire, there are Christians there too. Don't do this, sire. Please, sire, don't burn it! Sire, don't burn the village! We beg you, don't burn the village! O Lord... My Lord... Slain... Slain... Slain... Get up... Get up... Get up... Giblis... Giblis... Asaru... Asaru... Ihtere... Get up... Prahwe... Prahwe... Prahwe... I can't see. I can't see. Prahwe... I can't see! Prahwe... Prahwe! Prahwe! Prahwe!
