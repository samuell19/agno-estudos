- CH-I... - CHI... - L-E... - LE... CHl-CHl-CHl... LE-LE-LE... Viva Chile! THE STORY OF AND "ENOCH SOAMES" BY MAX BEERBOHM Viva Chile! …it seems to me a foolish, a rather wilful notion THE CHILEAN WRITERS SOCIETY to suggest that the Chilean novel is somehow cowardly, that Chilean novelists have not dared to face reality, to interfere in reality… You know they're words, just words. When has he ever written anything important? With a little substance? Never… eh? Who, who can that be? Tell me! ...Can you aspire to something? No, to nothing. He's one of those copiers who copy other copiers... It is exactly what is happening. There is no cowardice. Cowardice! No one said anything about cowardice! This'll last thirty years, at least! - When will we finish talking about policy? - Never. - Any excess and to avoid. - But not too much. Ah, look! I've caught this little bird! This bastard owes me money. Pay me my money! It's you I'm talking too - Gutierrez! You queer Gutirezzez! Queer Pay me the money! ORDER WHAT YOU WANT, AS YOU CAN SEE, IN HERE I AM GOD. Martyrs, but real martyrs! Like in the Valapariso fire! They were real martyrs. - Your uncle, now he is fantastic… - Why, because he's a Senator? But there's nothing fantastic about you, is there? - Come on, let's decide. - That one is always the impaled one! - Don't look at him. A bottle of 'Banquete', please. Ok, but can you change tables please? This one's occupied. - Okay, where to? - This way. Watch, he pretended not having visas. What's so fantastic about him? - Who? - My uncle. Is it because he's a Communist? - A Communist!? Well, alright then, a leftist. You know who has been the most exploited person in the family? My uncle Antonio. He was a commander in Ranquil. The most exploited in the whole family He died in a rotten little flat. We had to make a whip-around, when he died, for his widow, so she could bury him. Change the record, will you! Here he comes… How's it going? - Good. It's you I wanted to talk to. Excuse me, just a quick word… He's a real bore, this guy. And you can't contradict him on anything. - He's a social climber. - But he's alright. - He's a social climber. Can't you see how this idot's messing him up? - He's a social climber. Hey, now its your turn. Excuse me… please grant me a minute? - Of course. He asked me for 4,00 pesos. - Did you give it to him? - Are you mad? It was for a 'subscription' to a poetry book. What's happened to Tony anyway? - I don't know. I think Braulio's been playing with himself too much - We should find him a woman. - We should get him a blind date! Its your turn. Er, I'm sorry, am I being a nuisance? - That's right. But... just a quick word? - I've not got any money. I just wanted to invite you all to a conference. You know, the university invited me to hold a series of conferences. The first one's going to be tomorrow. You know the University's encouraging poetry now... Excuse me, may I sit down? - Yes, of course. - You got the message then? - Yes, very kind of you. Not at all, I've just got some money, so you can order whatever you like. Many thanks. - Hallelujah! Hallelujah! I'm with some friend. - It looks as if they are calling you. It doesn't matter. I have come here for you because I wanted to explain one thing. But it would be like shortening my life. - I hope it doesn't last too long. - I'm sorry? It's just that sometimes lives that are shortened last a long time. No, I know well the value of time. Do needn't worry. Well, as I was saying, the fact is I received a bit of extra money, you know. So I said to myself… 'Let's see if they are free to have a meal with me'. - Thank you. - No, I do not want to be thanked, So just order what you like, because I'm God around here. May I sit down? - Of course, your welcome. Well, is it a miracle or isn't it? No, you'll not beat me! No, you'll not beat me! If you want to imitate me you'll have to do a Rancagua accent. And if you imitate me I'll imitate you. Listern to my accent: Onofrio! Iquique! - And a port. You are on the right track. - Well, excuse me. Go ahead. Right then… A hallelujah for the lads. Hallelujah! Hallelujah! How about going to the market now then? - Hallelujah! Attention please! Good evening ladies and gentlemen. We are going to begin the first show of the evening, I present Tony Ventura. A very good evening to you. Once more I have come here, ready to devote my heart and soul to entertaining you. First of all I would like to perform a beautiful number by Ruiz and Villagra, entitled 'Shipwreck'. This 'number' is dedicated to all tables except one. They call me a lost man... and I don't know why... Do not worry! The riff-raff will never understand art! A moment. Just because the world... Come on, hurry up! Let's go! Come on, move, let's go! Beautiful my friend... Beautiful! Come on, come on! We're going to dream of angels… Terrifying angels! Not me, because in an hour and a bit I have to be in the office. With a couple hours sleep I'll be like a king again. Lie down there. I'm going to wash my face. - Am I disturbing you? - No, far from it. All I'm saying is that I share this house with my cousin. If he arrives just say you're a friend of mine, all right? That's all… Perfectly clear to me... Are you interested in this poem, which I am going to read..? Not much, after all... After all… A good phrase… Nobile... Generous… All that wine… left of vermilion, On another evening projected beneth the flocks of seagulls which fly away in circles. Chorus of inverted eyes, Cavity turned in upon itself. My soul! Tell me the truth, I want your sincere opinion. Let's see … Wine left... Already. Well, this as an invocation it works well, you know what I mean?... I mean it's supposed to functions as an attribute when you say: "My soul". I say "attribute", you understand, for want of a better word. In general the structure is acceptable, I don't know about opening and concluding the poem with two such open images... The bit about 'all that wine' is ruined by 'my soul'. I mean, they give it a rather thin atmosphere. it gets a bit lost afterwards with 'turned in upon itself'. and before that we've already said: 'under the flocks of seagulls'. And then 'inverted cavity, turned in upon itself'. This, you understand, gives it the atmosphere of a labyrinth... I mean a labyrinth that needs resolving in a more complete way because if no, you see, it ends as if the poem isn't closed. And that's serious, you understand, in terms of a classic structure... in an invocation of this sort, you understand? ...and of the manifest incompetence of some of those currently responsible for it's political destiny. Chile is a country which is not only rich in material resources, but one which also possesses a strong tradition of social responsibility, and is an example of excellence and progressive will. Just a moment... We'll go together, then. Yeah, but I have to ring my old lady. You know you shouldn't listen to that guy. He's really sinister. He stayed more than a fortnight in my house. And how did he manage that? Once he’s in you never get rid of him. And he steals, too. He stole an idea for a novel from me. Then he went round for about a year saying that it was his... Do me a favour, I'll put you down, and you call me tonight ok? Yeah, and then? No, no, no. The title first, - 'Ossessione bolero'. You can't have 'obsession,' change it. - But that's what it's called. But you can't do that. - What? You can today more than ever. - No, they release 'obsessions' everyday. - Put my name underneath. - Okay, what's your name? - Put my name and surname. Next please. Right. Here it comes. - Are you going to call? - Okay. What's her name? - Sara. - I thought her name was Elena? No. Sara. Just say there's a message from her husband to bring the tape recorder. The tape-recorder? Wait a moment! - The recorder, everything's got to be recorded for the lawyer. So you'll tell her its a message from her husband, and he's expecting a reply. If she say 'yes', you tell her he says 'I love you' If she say 'no', you tell her the husband says 'Go to hell'. That's right. - Institution? - 'Popular Promotions'. - Have you brought the receipt. - Yes You'll have to pay 3,000 pesos. - For what? You'll have to pay another 3.000 pesos. It's tax for the rebuilding of the South. Juan Mendoza Mujica, Olivetti. Have you got permission from the factory? - No. Well, it doesn't matter. - Hey, that guy's outside. - Yes, he's been around three or four times. He's looking for some songs for an LP, or something like that, Title? - 'You Wanted'. - Have you brought the lyrics? - Yes - Tomas! - Ok sit down, sit down. Listen, Tomas... I'm going. I'll see you later in 'Las Tejas'. - Quite a moment Sorrry, where? - In 'Las Tejas', We can have lunch together? Let's see if we can get rid of this guy, eh? He needs kicking out. I can send him to the hospital with no trouble at all. You heard what he did to me? - Ah yes, he stole your overcoat. - No, there is another, more recently, - That was the last straw. I attack work at 10. - Come. - Fine. See you at one-thirty at the latest. - Well one-thirty or two-o'clock. No, I can't make two. I've got a dentist appointment. - Bye, then. - Bye Whistle! - 'You wanted' Can I sing it? - No, singing's not so precise. Can I interrupt you a minute, maestro? - Yes, what is it? - It's a beautiful melody! It has soul,and the important thing is it's not stupidly sentimental. Congratulations! Its very lovely. They'll stamp it for you outside. Next week the copy of the score will be ready. When you come, bring 2000 pesos, in stamps. Excuse me, maestro. Did you see my recommendation? - Yes, I saw it. May I take a few liberties? Here is my authorisation. Yes, but within the limits of our responsibilities, eh! No, no, it's very simple. You understand, this gentleman's composition is a very interesting, and I'd like to talk to him a about it. but first, of all I'd like... pleased to meet you. - My pleasure, ...but I'd like you to do me the great favour of accompanying me on this number. I've just been listening to. It would be a tremendous satisfaction for me, if I could include the number in my next LP. Here's the contract. - No, no, that's fine. If you'd be so kind... - Are you Argentinan? - No, I'm Chilean. From Antofagasta. And proud of it. Have you any objections? - No, none. Whenever your ready, maestro. You have wished, you wished that there was not desolation and sadness comparing your beauty with true love. You have forgotten, I don't forgive you this oblivion you have denied the chimera to convert this longing into an abyss of passion. What do you know of true love? What do you know of dreams? The word love, love, love, love, love, love. It's the emotion of his triumph. I'll take care of him. So, what we talking about? - 'The first stones' - that's a possibility. - The first stones of what movement? Ministry, school… the first stones. Right, put down 'The first stones'. Any old thing. Give me a match, please. You know, Gabriela Mostral? There's a really Chilean subject. Certain. And the working class martyrs who pass into history as the injured, and even if they die after a month, they still end up as heroes. You don't remember anybody... How about just 'the workers'? That's not Chilean! Just 'the workers’? - No, that's not Chilean. - All right, we'll scratch that one. Anyway, that doesn't work here. With the 'open hand' policies... It wouldn't work anywhere. But in any case there aren’t any here. We don't want to make propaganda for priests either! - No! - Right. Let's see, what else? - The lack of bullfights… - But there are cockfights. - Yes, but they're illegal. 30 years of the Christian Democrat party. - No, not that one… Put it down. The 30 years … 30 years of democracy … We need something a little more serious. Yes, cut out the joking. I know… Pablo Neruda's Nobel prize, Okay. And the bad luck of the Chilean football team. They always lose… Bad luck. And they are not going to do any better this year. But then what about boxing? - No, in Chile there's no boxing. In Chile there the true boxing. - How there the true boxing? What do you mean? Chileans spend all their time boxing. - No. - Let's go out into the country then? - No, I hate the country. Sounds like an offical broadcast on National TV. Yes, there is the anthem. Anyway I've no idea… Will you give me a hand to pull him out of the house? About Five, is that ok? - Fine. Five o'clock it is. On the dot. Can you make it? - Yes. - And how about something historical? - What, like the War in the Pacific? No, no... How about making it Seven instead? - All right, Seven. - Yes, of course. Seven all right for you? - Yes. What about a number dealing with the Araucanians? The French Emperor and Araucania. Just listen! Full of the patriotic fervour of the national conscience... Excuse me, could you turn it up a bit? Thank you. To all those who profess the Christian faith. ...the representations which the Government, on behalf of the people of Chile, have been making to the Holy See, have achieved justice regarding an authentic yearning profoundly felt by generations of Chileans. His Holiness has just agreed to the canonisation of Friar Andy, the Chilean saint, the saint of the poor of this country suffering country. Good evening... Hello! How've you been? Where've you been all this time? What a lovely colour you are! Is this a new one? What happened to Braulio? - Don't wake him. He's got a hangover. Where have you been? I can never find you. I've been a bit... lost. I was on my own business. And Braulio? - Who? - Braulio! He's got my keys. I've got them myself. Here are your keys. - Thank you. - Thank you for being so kind. - I've said that haven't I? I see that you don't thank your guests anymore... Shall I go or stay? Sit down. I think there is a little wine over there. No, he's drunk it all, even the vinegar. Listen you bastard. - What are you going to do for me? Do you want me to go, you hypocritical dwarf? Speak up like a man. Okay, okay! Why you must always lie? Why you have to be so cold and calculating? Why can't they have a few feelings, the shits! All right, I'm sorry. I'm going. I just brought this short story. for you to read. I can't now, I've lots of work. Why not leave it for me in the office? When you have a bit of time, try to read it. If you say so. - You must think it's good? - Read at least five pages. Look. What's this "Nimburiche" got to do with it? He's a beautiful poet, he wrote himself, Yeah, all right, I'll read it later. It is a love story between a man and a girl, Very exciting. Do they get married? Both pleasure. - Good. You mustn't judge by apperances. He's a good lad. This girl going to die! I've come for some papers that I left here, Certaintly. Go ahead, look for them yourself. No, not urgent. The thing is I need them for a talk I'm giving. You're all invited as well, you remember? Yes, thanks very much. Beat it you son of whore! - Don't start that again. No, sometimes you have things in your head and they just get out... Move it you son of a whore! Hey, don't start that again. Don't stir it. Well… I'll come back in about a half an hour, Ok? Since its not possible to stick around here. Say that again, you shit! Listen, at least let him take his papers. Tell your friend he'd better leave. It's no problem for me. I can come for them any time. Listen you shit, I'll give you a hiding wherever I find you! I thought that, given the situation, we could go out for a walk. Sure, the only problem is I have some urgent things to do. I'll kill you if you don't come with us! - You will be with us! - Yes sure. Forgive me for telling your friend to go away… but the fact is, I'm a little afraid of him. CHILE 2- 1 ECUADOR Chile! Chile! Chile! There are new flowers in the rose garden near the wall of the old garden and with the roses I take an oath to bring my love for a moment. Hey, that kid has a beautiful child. - Just the one? - Two, a boy and a girl. Yes, but the little girl is really ugly. Not she's not ugly, it's just that she's still a baby. No, she's a real mess. Only the boy is beautiful. I've got seven children. I believe in families of six or more. Sorry, these are friends of mine. - Very happy. - Pleasure. - Very pleased. Pleased to meet you. - Pleasure. - My pleasure. We came to help get the guest out. - Thank you, but we got rid of him. - Who? We were referring to Braulio. I think he needs a good beating. There is no other way with that guy. At first I felt sorry for him, but now I don't believe a word he says. - Lisetta! Ah, Tomas, I'd forgotten. Look. - Good. - What do you think? - Good. - We'll see. Lisetta! Yesterday I've looked for you all the day. - I hope you'll read this letter. - I love you. Sara. Great! The problems have ended. It's alright, don't you think? - Can I watch it? - Sure. I am separated from my wife, but the matter seems to have reached a solution. Are you sure? Excuse my intrusion, but are sure it is a safe to take this step? Maybe you cannot understand the matter. My wife, you must know, is very smart and wonderful. The problem is that she is dominated from her father. We have discussed it many times but perhaps now we have solved it. You must know that I am in love with my wife. - Really? - You rememer the letter she sent me the other day? The suicide letter? - No, well all right, that one for instance… When there's talk of suicide, things are going badly. I tried to kill myself twice. - Twice. - Yes, twice. One day I'll shoot myself for sure. That's why I always go around prepared. For that I remove the bullets. Can I have a look? - With pleasure. It's good steel and that's the important thing. I don't know if it's any good. The bullets are very peculiar. Where can you get them? I don't know. I have a cousin who works in the Italian armoury. Excuse me. I'm singing this one. - Go ahead. Look! What a fabulous character! - And strong. Fantastic! He carries a revolver and pulls it out. These are the guys you have to write about, this is Chile! - Watch them there are those such. - This Chile understand? This is Chile. - But what got? But what got? - We are too Europeanised, Macche existentialism! But that cabbage and this? - What an idiot and whatever. Watch. What do you want me to write about? Mine workers in the north? - Why not? - Or about the peasants? - And why not? But do you know how to ride a horse? - That's got nothing to do with it? There's a whole lot to be discovered in the countryside. You can raise without having to do that… - Of course, but can you ride a horse? - What are you going to write about then? Your aunties? - Can you ride a horse? Do you want to write about your aunt that drinks tea? - Can you ride a horse? - Oh, go to hell! What are you looking at? Yes, I say to you, that just you are turning over. [tbc] If you want to look, look. But look in the face, man to man. Moron! I am the devil. A very charming man. Where have I seen you? In no place. I am the devil and it's enough. And then I am much more. I'll make you tremble with pleasure, I'll take you to the other world! Now I have you, baby! - It's true! I've got you tied up. You can't resist me! Let me take this step. ...poor woman, she felt asleep like Mimì and Manò. Cheerful, sentimental and mischievous, the poetry of Cartier. Who would say that his poetry with only one verse would have the same mysterious charm as Margarita Gautier. What's going on between you two!? Come here! Fabulous! Stop, go back! Don't serve, wait a moment. Hang on a minute, I'll return immediately. And now, I'm not armed. - Come on, in the Chilean way! May I present the devil? - Pleased to meet you. - Very pleased. - A pleasure. We already know each other. - Are you Argentinean? - No sir, I'm Chilean. That's not how the tango is danced. I'm from Antofagasta, more than chilean. Much pleasure, - Not at all. - He's the devil. - We're all a bit devilish here. He wanted to encourage us from him. No, I just thought that… since we've met up on a night like this it would be a great pleasure to be able to show you something of local Bohemian life. Because the senorita here has expressed an interest. But I have to tell you one thing. I'm like a son to Aunt Ernestina. Which one is that? Aunt Ernestina, from Carrascal, where Nato Alejo went, the kid Gloripo's nephew. Anyhow, what I suggest, if your interested, is that we go and have a few drink in the Luzern and the 'Black and White', I do a number and then we go home. And will there be any cocaine? - I am sorry, sir, but I don't understand. I swear, I do not know what is saying. But we'd have to go right now. - Well, let's go. - But we haven't got any money! - Do not worry. Please do not talk about money now, someone will pay. Can you lend me 20,000 pesos until Friday? You know I'll pay you back! Look who's there. No, nothing serious. - Look! - No... it's nothing. - How many of you? - Just the two. Thanks. Good evening. What happened to Tomas? He left with the others, They're coming in another taxi. Hell! Lisetta won't be there! To go to Luseum? What will you have? - For me nothing. How much are the cocktails? - Stright gin only 20,000. - God, it's cheap! Then there's Cinzano and others. - Pisco with coca cola? - No, I've whisky, cognac, cinzano... And the 'plastic pictures'? You're out of date. 'Plastic pictures' haven't been around for ages. You know what the rage is now? The 'simultaneous'. - Do you know what they are? - Yes. Who are they? Colleagues from the Chilean Bank's office. I cannot speak about it. But I can talk about this little box. - What is it? - It's like a kind of BENVIRTIN. The same thing, but cheaper There's only one problem... You have to drink it with beer, because it has a diuretic effect. I mean your up and down all night with it. Come on, come on! One, two. One, two. One, two... - Do you know where the bathroom is? - Round the corner. Shall we go to my place? Look, no... Why not? I've got a record player at home and even alcohol. Let's go to my place! The thing is, we're looking for a guy with an Argentine accent. That guy came here, but he went away again. Then we can go home? - We can go to my place. - I don't know. Let's go to my house. We can drink something and listen to a little music. - Let's go. - Okay, let's go. Come in quietly, one by one… I don't know what I'm doing here? Sorry, where is the bathroom? You have to be silent Quiet! Come but lower your voice. Where is the light? I have to go to the bathroom. In silence, I recommend you. - Did you finish? - Wait a moment. ... so I'm going... to the port where is... the golden boat... Come in, come in. Be my guests! He is my eldest son, Gustavo. Go ahead. - We are sorry, miss. - We are being a nuisance. You're not being a nuisance at all. Look how pretty my little girl is. But look at her… - Come on, let's go boys... But there's no problem, stay. We are too much trouble to the lady. No, no problem. - It's very pretty, very nice here. - Thank you. You're nice. - What time is it? - It's about five-thirty. I'm sorry, we just met your husband. - No really, it doesn't matter. I don't want post-dated cheques... Can you wait a month? No, I'm committed… I've got to pay the licence on the Citroen by the 15th. - I don't understand a thing. - He's a bastard that Argentinia. - Good evening. - Good evening Miss. On the left, you prick! Courageous boys... I'll expect you for lunch at my place tomorrow. - That's all right by me. - Make a note, do you have some paper? - No, I do not. Whose idea was this. This guy doesn't deserve the wife he's got. - No, of course he doesn't. Who'd disturb her at this time by arriving with this drunk crowd? Nobody. Here have a drink. - No, I don't want to. Come on, have a shot you little sissy. Why don't we leave? I'm fed up with this. - Wait a moment. - What are we waiting for? There's still time. I wanted to give you my address, so we can meet for lunch. - I haven't got any paper. - Me neither. - What happened to Tomas? - I have no idea where he'll be. I do not think they left. - And who's Tomas? - The guy we were with. He drinks like a sponge. Is he a genius? - No, he's clever but you don't know him. - I'll expect you for lunch, then? - Ok. - See you tomorrow. Hey, you! Come here... Drink a shot with us... Wait a moment... I wanted to tell you one thing. Tell me. Asshole! You're taking advantage of your wife's good nature. - Why? - Listen. Okay. I'm separated and have 3 children, so I know what I'm saying. OK, if you want preach, go ahead. Tell me directly. I don't know much about you ...but your wife is marvellous. But do you tell her? - Of course! Why not? Cecilia! Cecilia, love. - I am here. - Come, come here. Listen, if I could, I'd take her off you. You are as virile as six male, asshole! Come on, boys, you are at home. I'll be back soon. - Here I have a few cups of coffee. - Thank you, Miss. I've already added sugar. - Yes. - Two teaspoons. Why not dance a little? Let's go, let's get going. Stay silent... I can't stand it... Why must I tolerate you? Don't worry, take it easy... Please, love. So let's go. Come on Tomas. - What got this with that? - Come on, let's go. - Do not do nothing. - But where are you going? - Do you like these people? - No, they are snobbish. - But forget it. - Come on, come down. Let's go. Where are you going? Come down! I want you to never betray the sweet hopes of our awakening. Never will you need regret, if you come to dazzle me with woman's promises. Let's see you fall. Fall now. Go. Unless you move, I'll leave you here. Good evening. I was waiting for you, I really need those papers... Enter No... there's a young lady living here. Hello! - When did you arrive? - Last night. Wait outside a minute will you? I'll amuse myself, don't worry. Be careful he may vomit. - Trust me. - Thank you. - How are the kids? - Fine! Are you going to stay? But you've got visitors… Yes, but I can tell them to leave. - But didn't you invite them? - Well I didn't know you were coming? - I've got a lot to do today. - Go then, you don't have to stay. I wanted to talk to you actually... I need you to go with me to the lawyer. - You know the grant worked out? - Yes, I knew... I want to take the two kids.. that's why... But that's already fixed up. Well, tell me when… no one ever knows with you. What? Of course you do! I'd have liked to do it tomorrow morning. - Ok, call me at the office. - At what time? - When you want. Listen, why don't we fix it definitely for the day after tomorrow in the morning? Fine, the day after tomorrow, or any day. You're still going to Oregon, right? Yes, the Chicago idea didn't work out. And how much is it a month? - 125 dollars. It's not much. - No, it's fine. We ought to have lunch together one of these days. - Why don't you come to the house? - No, I'm not going there anymore. - Well, I must go - I'll go with you. - No, your friends await you. - How about a hug - Hello, chico! - I must dance with you! We could have lunch tomorrow in the University. That's be good. Then we can go on to the lawyer. - Why not! I must dance with you. Why don't you dance with this fellow here? - Come lets dance. - Thank you. - Have you got a little wine? - Let's see. - Would you like to dance too? - No, you dance with him. Attention! Any good? It's good. Now I shall sleep… like a Roman emperor! You are too drunk, better that I leave. - Hey, I'll go with you. - No, stay here with your guests. - No, no, let's go. - Okay. - What is love? - Nothing. Right. The priest Molina... - No, not the priest Molina. The Chilean relatives of the priest Molina. The priest isn't here and nor are his relatives, from Villanueva to Zanartu. The priest Molina... or The Punta Arenas shipwrecks too... Yesterday they took away the battles and then the treaty of Concon. For the moment... The priest Molina. The priest Molina! - Is it hurting you? - A fair bit. - Have a cup of coffee. - Don't be an idiot. Listen, I hope this trip to Lima comes off. All it would take would be a subsidiary from the Encyclopedia. In that case I could make a nice all expenses paid trip. There's a study on Inca Garcilaso, or rather by the Chilian imitators of the Inca. A couple of months ago I was on the point of getting a trip to Mexico? When I was working here, I was to go too. Who went to Mexico in the end? - Those bastards in'M'. But Joaquin Murieta isn't in'M', he's in 'B', under the heading 'bandit'. Let's say 'G' - 'G' for 'guerrilla'. - He was never a guerrilla! - Of course not! Anyway, he wasn't Chilean! In the Encyclopedia he's down as 'supposedly Chilean'. You mean a Chilean by reputation. The priest Molina... - Good afternoon. - Hello. - Have you remembered? - Remembered, what? My talk, it's this afternoon. The second one, I mean, because it's a series. Yes, we'll be going. What time does it start? - It's at seven, but they always start late. - Good. We're going to sleep for a little while, and then we see, alright? - I'll wait for you. - We will come… It's ok. I'll take a look around while you sleep. And that way we can all go together. - Yeah… bye. Hey… wait for us in the part where Juan Egana's 'Contemporary Poets' is. Thanks very much! 'After that woman, I would not sit down with the frightful face of love. "Let us leave this story. The years of hell go by. 'Behind is Concepción, here is Santiago. 'The teeming suburbs of Santiago. 'The loneliness of a Sunday spent watching a film of Ramon Navarro. 'Or this corner. 'There one would have to write, sickened... 'animula... coral... torrent... ' or 'Black tongue unfold'. 'Here the vertigo... here the chains... 'Then the magic... 'Certain initiates go in the early hours to a big house on Manuel Rodriguez street, to listen to a strange musician, who was just becoming known - Bartok. 'There would be introduced the poet of illuminations and the poet of disorder:- Carlitos Torres, a man of the world, run over by a tram after a night of madness. And Jorge Claro, who was later to become a minister under President Ibanez. 'In that period they played a poetic game which was in vogue at the height of surrealism. 'The initiates called it 'the exquisite corpse'. 'I have preserved some of them. 'This one, written one lunchtime in what was then Cafe Sao Paulo, enjoyed the participation of the following poets, some of whom are now lost forever: 'Oscar Maldonado, today a farmer and father of a family; 'Andres Riglietti, the brilliant surgeon, who died at the peak of his career; 'Carlitos Toro, who is known to you, and present today; 'Jorge Lleida, the lawyer and today film critic at 'La Nacion'; 'Pedro L. Carles, actor and dreamer. 'This is the 'exquisite corpse', and these are photos of those who participated. Maldonado - "Whither his ear?" Riglietti - 'Chile, thou notched sword, give me a glass of chicha'. Carlitos Toro - 'I love you, because your legs are not pink, like those of you-know-who'. Lleida - 'Listen to this song, lala-lala'. Carles - 'I put you in my pocket I open my hands I am a poet, and?' 'Mathematics should not be learned. 'And I make a pact with the devil between one glass and the next. 'Let's go backwards, enough!' 'Passion of mirrors, 'Bags under the eyes. 'The task of another, of the Argentines. 'End. 'Fall, autumn leaf, I await you in the wood. As soon as I'm up, I'll go to the office'. Well, that's all for today. Next week we will continue with the mature years and the first poems of the urban phase. I shall quote from the following: Jose Dominguez, Hernan Pino, Lucita Martoren and Carlo Lates. If any of you see them, please let them know. Thank you. Hello, are you leaving already? - My compliments. - Did you like the slide projection? - It didn't come out too well. - Maybe it was not perfect. What can you do, you know how things are at the university. However thanks. It's not easy you know... ...it's not easy to go through all of this without losing cleanness. Did somebody ask me about Carlitos Lattes? Something like that happened to him, only differently. An extraordinary poet. He used to structure his sonnets wonderfully. He published something, didn't he? What on earth would he have published? I've seen piles of papers this high. He's a very complete man really. He played - what's it called? Jazz. The trumpet, he studied piano for more than 15 years. Chess Player. As a player of chess he was extraordinary. Shut up, you idiot. Isn't he the Lattes whose work appeared in an anthology of young Chilean poetry around 1945? It didn't appear anywhere. But I think you interrupted me? Yes, you idiot I interrupted you. Do you think I'm not man enough to respond? I've no idea whether you are or not. I'm talking to him. If you don't like it, go to another table. - This little guy's great! I'll remain silent. If you have something to say, say it! I don't want a fight with you. I've just never liked being friends with weak-minded people. What I tried to say was that I saw Lattes' work in an anthology of visionary poets, along with Anguita, Claudia Arenas and Cerrano. No! He never published anything! - I have known him as a brother. - Nothing ever published! I've written an article on that subject. It makes me laugh! Excuse me for laughing. Listen... ...just leave him in peace. - It does not hurt anyone. - You are foolish! - Listen a moment. What have you in your head, he has nothing to do with him, so leave him alone. - Nobody knew Carlistos Lattes. - Shut up will you! That gentleman wants a word over by the piano. Tell him ok. Does he think I don't realise what he's doing? Where does he think I've put my eyes? What signals? Those signals, see. What? - Listen. - Shut up. As a poet you're pretty bad. - Leave him alone. - Listen. Pretty bad, pretty bad, unfortunately. - Do you want to hear something? You are a bad poet. In another 100 years we'll see who's who. Why not stop and leave him alone and let him speak? Stop it! The jokes over. - What do you want? - What happens to you, good heavens? Son of bitch! If you want to fight we can step outside... - Listen friends. - What is it? - What are you fighting for? - No one's fighting there. - Rubbish! - You know fighting is prohibited here. Can I tell you a story? - Go ahead. Two months ago I was released from prison, Good evening and thank you very much. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Once more I am here ready to give you my voice, my soul, and my artist's heart. But tonight is a special evening for me. Among us this evening is a man, a poet, of great national stature. And it so happens that precisely on this day, he celebrates his birthday. He's a great friend of mine. So before beginning the show, I ask you, ladies and gentlemen, to please give him a big hand and a chorus of 'Happy Birthday'. Respected public and friends, I would like to take this opportunity to make the point that it is not often that such a select group of Chileans gets together to pay homage to a poet. It seems to me, that there are other places, other institutions, responsible for looking after the needs of the poet. These institutions, whether they be called the Society of Writers or House of Culture, do not fulfil their role. There is no protection, no social security for the poet. Other, more fortunate poets, whether their names are Reieres or Varqueros, would seem to occupy the attention of all literary circles of our country. We others have to wait. We others have to hide under a tombstone and wait for the tables to turn. Thus on this occasion, this occasion on which I have been humiliated, I would like to make a toast, and then inspired... by my new friend here, whom I am just getting to know, For this reason, I want to raise my glass before this select group of Chileans, who have been able to see beyond... Yes, beyond this and that's all. I'm sure you must be thinking, as am I, that it would be unjust if this great poet and friend of ours, were to leave us without allowing us to hear one of his most beautiful compositions. Especially since, we may then know them, when with the passage of time, they are recognised for their true worth. "What but I, or the ocean, or the minute throat of a lizard, must hope for a... … I'm sorry, but I can't go on. I am very moved. A big hand for our poet! And now a song! For he's a jolly good fellow, For he's a jolly good fellow, For he's a jolly good fellow, and nobody can deny. - This one's better. - Which one? - I like money. - Is someone at the door? No, it's your aunt. No, she's asleep you fool. Let see, number one: Come, concentrate. 'A young Englishman goes to teacher training school. No, how long are you going to go on writing about teachers? - Just carry on! 'On his first day of lectures he meets a girl from a higher year. A friendship is born. But the spectre of class prejudice appears between them. He is of working class origin. It will all end in failure. The narration is read by his mechanic brother, who understands nothing'. - No, stop. I vote against. No, vote yes. Where are we up to? There's seven days left. God! There's no more than a week to go. When's the competition's closeing date? - It must be around now - On the 15th. But the stories have to be handed in to Concepcion, not to Santiago. So we'll have to finish two days early. Good evening. Good evening! Speak softly! My aunt's sick. - The whole world is sick. - Would you mind leaving we're writing. Fine. I'm going. Allow me to greet you? Yes, but be quick! I know... everything. Even that. Good evening. Could you make less noise please. I'm on the telephone. I know you're writing a story about me. Yes or no? - No I'm not. I'm the protagonist. A subject, you might say... ...a grand subject, no doubt. Yes, but go now, do not see that we are working? Doing good work too. I brought this bottle. May I make one last request? May I have one last drink with you? - Sure, sit. Open the door, I think someone's knocking. No, it's nobody. Right, let's carry on. - It's fine to go forward. - Yes. Subject number one is scratched, then. Let's try number two. A domestic servant decides to steal the savings... ...that belong to her mechanic boyfriend. No, not another mechanic! - Go ahead. To give to her boss who's in financial difficulties. Love for the boss equals social climbing. The boss laughs at her. An internal monologue by the servant as she disposes of the bills one by one down the toilet. Ah horrible! - Then she must commit suicide! - No, I vote she doesn't. All right, you propose a list of subjects! - Tell me, why not try a glass? - All right. May I come in? - Yes, come in, your welcome. - Thank you. Good evening everybody... ...pardon the interruption. May I sit? Please forgive this painful spectacle, but I am just carrying out my duty. This gentleman has an account to settle, not with me, but with the law. Enough. Crocodile tears! They won't conceal the truth! As you know, I celebrated this gentleman's birthday recently. ...and I was the one who paid. Look how he repays me! By stealing my watch A 50,000 peso watch! And other things as well. Not that the money is important, but I have to carry out my duty. So if you'll excuse me... - Do not take me away. Take off your jacket, please. Aren't we going to have a farewell drink? To your good health, life that I despise so much. To your health, world... ...sink with me! - Cheers - Cheers - At the prize. - El Sud Newspaper. - At the south of Concepcion. At the prize. Diaz tried to bribe the jury? He has always been part of it. . - E Martinez? - Him also. They are the founders. Right lads, goodnight and thank you very much for everything. Don't do that. They will be friends of the President. Cheers! Hey, ask Maria to clean all this filth. Maria! Well let's get to work again. Serve yourself a drink. A butcher cuts his wife's throat. Dammit, that's another mechanical theme. A detective tortures the butcher, then it is condemned. Maria! The action develops in a highly parallel fashion, so that it becomes clear that all three are victims of a society which... institutionalises violence. Already had that. - Maria! This one's about a failed poet who makes a pact with the devil. He goes into the future to see if anyone remembers his poetry. But he finds that no one knows anything about it at all. This one is better. The only thing I'd add is that the poet goes back to his friends and says "I know what you are doing you're writing a story about me. " - Hello. - There's no menu here. Are you going to the meeting tonight? - Are you out of your mind? Can you lend me some money? - No, ask someone else. ...look a letter from your friend of yours. Who can I ask? - There's no menu today? - No. Could you do me a favour? Miss, can you bring me the menu? - There no menu. Ah, I didn't hear you. Well, I'll have the same thing they ordered. Whose letter? Braulio. What did you order? - Arroz a lo chileno. - The chileno, I can't eat that. Miss! Shit, she's already gone. The onion is bad for me. - Read it. - This what is it? - A letter. - I can't understand the writing. - Give it here. Let's see. I've got a cheque for Monday... 'To you, Waldo, and to no one else can I reveal my secret. A secret that has been tormenting me for a long time. A certain philanderer, you know who I mean'... That must be you, eh? '... a certain philanderer will not be able to penetate what you I know your antennas will be able to understand. I am condemned. Does that word mean anything to you? I am of another world. I have been looking for you all day". He left this in my office this morning. How do you like the green ink? Just like Neruda used! Wow! Green ink, let's see. - This is the bus's story, I believe. - Let's see. From Antofagasta, where my condemnation was to have been consumated, we went to another plane it is better not to mention, A whore! My words would not be capable of describing what my eyes were barely able to bear face to face. But it was not a face which was in front of me. But an old Mitsubishi coach heading for Matucana Empty. By the way: myself and my mysterious partner sat on the back seat. When the conductor, in desperation asked us for our tickets, my partner stretched out his hand to him along the entire length of the bus. as if he had a 12 meter long arm. He paid the appropriate 250 pesos, and his arm returned to its normal length'. Ah! Too close to me! It's fabulous. - Jump to another point. - This must be published. - Of course. - What power! We crossed a very large estancia; I heard howls, I heard roars. I howled myself. We arrived at a small hall, of an indescribable, but striking colour'. What colour could be indescribable but striking? - Red! - No, fuschia perhaps. Anyway: 'There we signed the final contract. 'In a few moments I would know glory or damnation. Disgusting handwriting! 'But not that of myself alone. I am not so egotistical. 'The fate of the whole of Chile was in the balance. The fatherland, now? - The young nation! - The young nation! 'I had to see what had become of my friends. 'Would you also not have tried to visualise what would happen? in the not too distant, though incalculable, future? 'We began the ritual. First I removed my clothes. 'Then came the grease. Then the signs. So many hair-raising things that human lips would be unable to express them' They fuckedd him, those bastards! 'Then all of a sudden, the miracle happened. The prohibited experience'... - Again! - It's as clear as water. ...finally bore fruit. 'There I was, beyond death and beyond life ghost among the ghosts. Go on, go on... It's so boring! - Give me your glass! - Yes. - How do you want to incorporate it? - Miss brings us a glass, please! Thank you. So how want to exploit it? Look, one possibility is this: The story is the letters... - What letters? Ah, here's the food. It looks as if they are not going to give us a pay rise this month. I've know that for a week. Miss, don't bring me the chilena, just potatoes! How did you know? Look, the story is the letters, as I said. I received one too. But I didn't bring it... Letters, understand, letters! Any good? - Not much. - Here it is! - Good. - See! Right, the story is about two friends, who receive letters in the morning and read them at lunchtime. Why not three? - Right? - Yes. So we introduce ironic comments, to the letters. You understand, like some dirty words... - Yes, to extend them. To complement them precisely. Then he says how he made a pact... ...etc, ecetra, ...and the ritual with the devil. - Yes, sure. - What do you reckon? - Well... But it's very epistolary, isn't it? The letters are too romantic. But that's the best part! - The modern bit consists of the interposed comments, - Plus the monologue.. - What monologue? - The condemned man's monologue. - No, the monologue of the devil! No, the condemned man's monologue is much better! All right, put the condemned man in a chorus. Read it... read the underlined part. 'I am the man I thought I was. I am the man I was before. I am the man who saw himself. Oh irony! Dispensing life and death... you've been able to inspire many'. See? The monologue of the condemned man is much better. No, an interior monologue has to be more chaotic, more stream-of-consciousness. But you mix it with free associations, look pass it over here. For example, the guy says: 'Azafer Megatocillas falls where'... for the interior, myself, you understand? That's how it is. - So it's both letters then? - No, three. No, no that can't be done. - Why not? - They're different techniques. - Who said so? - What's technique got to do with it. Read it, you'll see that it is possible. 'I see myself walking down some stairs in another world. 'They're waiting for me there. I greet them. I ask for someone of my own name. They smile. 'They already know the answer. 'They search with apparent zeal, but then tell me my name doesn't exist. 'I repeat the question, and ask them to check their shelves 'I insist and ask them to try in the National Liberary. 'They reply, no longer smiling: there are no libraries any more. The libraries are redundant! 'There are no libraries any more' And that's a different one speaking. Go on We have a museum, in whose library section your name does not appear. This is the museum. Take me. Take me to the library. I explain to them'. No, this bit'll have to be cut out. - Do not worry now, continue. - Yes. 'This is the Chile section. This is all there is. They show me an old copy of the newspaper El Sur, and there, under an assumed name, there is a reference to me. "Who wrote that story?" I ask, "Friends or foes?" You see! That's what I'm saying! So, the story is the letters, and he describes what he was searching for. It's too complicated! We have to look for an alternative. For example the story can be the letters without it said its the letters. - There are three letters now, I got another last night. - Another? - Three letters? Perfect, much better! Therefore.. Let see it... What kind of writing is this! 'Try to have them remember me' 'Try to have they remember me'. How disgusting! The era of the great poets is over! Look out there, - the tomb of Huidobre! - Let's go. Maybe we can get to Valparaiso? - Let's go to Santiago instead. - What? - I said let's go to Santiago! - Bloody hell! If we stay here we'll get full of sand. - How about a drink? - According to the regulation. - With our backs to the sea. Good afternoon! I hope I'm not interrupting? No, we saw you on the other beach but we didn't know it was you. Yes, I saw you too, but you never said hello. Well we didnt know it was you. I said: 'Those three lads on their own and here's me in such a fortunate position'. Fair's fair, eh? So I thought it was a good idea to have a word with you, since I'm with a few fabulous girls, and maybe you... - Of course, of course! - Well, I'll be leaving... Please, we can go all together... don't make too much fuss.. I organised things to perfection. Let's go! - No, I have to leave... Come on, there are horses for everybody too. Let's all go together... - No I'm not going with you. All right, but call my wife and tell her I'll be late? - Yes. And tell my father too. - Yes. OK, bye! The love goes away when you are not there. Help! Hello Coco, how's it going? - Good. - Are you on your own? - Yes, I'm alone. I'm really tired, so if you'll excuse me I'm going to bed. Of course. It's your bed. - I have to go to work early tomorrow. - I understand. - Where's your boyfriend? - Who? You know who. I don't know who you're talking about. Yes, you do. Seriously, I don't know who you're talking about. Do you think I'm lying? I spent the whole day on the beach. with German and Tomas. They stayed there. I left them because I'm trying to write a short story for the competition in 'El Sur'. You too, eh? - I've got to complete the formalities tomorrow. There's a number of national prize winners entered for that. I'm surprised at you mixing with all those shits. Are you going to read it to me? - It's not finished yet. I'll copy it for you. It's a bit confused. It's about a poet, a kind of Braulio figure, who makes a pact with the devil to see the future. - A la Bradbury. - No. It's a special sort of journey, a mental journey. - Just like Bradbury. Anyhow, he makes a pact with the devil, this poet, this Braulio figure, and he finds nothing. I mean, nobody knows anything about his poetry. All his things have been thrown away. and then... the only direct reference to his existence is a short story which tells how a poet makes a pact with the devil, to visit the future and see what is being said about him. Told in letter form. What we are reading is the letters, you understand? That is the public. - Like Bradbury from start to finish. - No, Borges maybe. - Borges is a reactionary! - Good night. Now I'll read you a poem, may I? Or do I just have to listen? - Read all you want, I'll listen. 'Patio of light. a shadow that we can not quite distinguish, suspended between the voices of the anonymous lost ring. Another one. 'A lark crosses the sky. Very early in the morning. We go to school'. What shit? - Did you really like the story? - It's very interesting. I'm thinking of putting more characters in it who follow Braulio. I mean more condemned men. - How many? - Several. - May I stay the night with you? - Yes, but I have to get up early tomorrow. - Whatever you say. Good night. - Good night. If you don't know, how do you expect me to? - Are you having a meeting down here? - Yes, as usual. - Well, I'll have to be on my way now. - Aren't you staying to eat? No, I've got a lot of work to do. - At this time of night? - I have to prepare for a conference. Political work? Not a political conference, it's about literature. - Listen, has Tomas written? - No, not since last year... He went down south three months ago, and there was no word from him. - Not even a telegram? - Not even one. Well, I have to be going now. - If he appears, can you let me know? - Of course, goodbye! ...'and opens the way to the long-awaited unified national wage claim by the 38 federations belonging to the United Workers Central. Point five: In addition, at trade union level we must pass resolutions repudiating the illegitimacy of the cost of living index, and plan our decision... 'Along with the Mandragora group, 'Along with the Mandragora group... we must also consider other young people who, under similar circumstances, dropped out later, hit by the special political conditions which prevailed in Chile at that time. These were the early years of the Popular Front. Among those to emerge were - Antonio Malbran, Maximillano Coloma, Santiago Escobar, These three were to form, in 1941 the 'Marcha' group, later to be joined by the poet Volodia Teitelboim. What is most important about this group, is not as one might think, what they called 'the immediate participation in the people's struggles'. It is their competent imitation of everyday speech, behind the language newspaper and their original application of the theories of Mayakowsky, Bloch, and Stephen Spender. They could be criticised — as indeed they were by right-wing critics of their time – for bastardising the best of Vellejo and the worst Herrera-Reyes. Never will need to repent... Promises of a woman... - Long time no see! - Good evening. - Would you like a drink? - Yes. - How've you been? - Not bad. And the lads? - I thought you'd know more about them. - Why should I know? - I haven't seen them for ages. - All right. But you like being with your friends don't you? - Why do you ask? I do not know. One always likes to stay among friends, or relatives… It's the same for me. Look me in the eyes. Tell me the truth. - Do you really know where they are? - No, I don't know. I need to have a talk with you. Why don't you wait for me after the show? - What for? We'll be waiting, its in your interests. Tomas! What are you doing? Come! Speak up! Out with it. Tell me what you have to say, or stay silent forever. - I don't know... it was you who... - Yes. Do you want to get down to brass tacks? Or not? - Why not? That's what I like to hear. Well. First of all you'll want to know why I'm interested in talking to you. After all, there are so many people in the world so why you? It's very simple. I only deal with people who meet the requirements. You understand? There are many people who are interested in my experiments. but I reject them. Because I do not want to sell anything, I'm not interested in gain. I'm interested in spiritual values, the soul of man, you understand? The modern world has yet to discover the potential of man. Today's world is interested in routine, in greyness. Sciences of the mind have no place. And the science of the mind is a very difficult science. Why? Because its essence is concentration. For instance, when I saw you, I realised immediately that there was no need to look at your heart, like sentimental people, or at your hands, like the men of action, or at your eyes, like the foreigners. I realised that one had to look here, but without crossing you, you understand? Another example: I know that you must have things explained well. That's why we are here. I know what's good for you. Do you know what I am offering you? A complete show. Why? You ask. Because I am an observer of experience, just like a researcher. - And does that cost money? - No, nothing. All I want is the right to make use of all spiritual values which may be achieved during the experiment. - And what happened to the lads? - Are you interested in the same things? Are you interested in dreams of the future? Or do you want to win the lottery, or win on the horses? Because that would be a different pact. - No, no, the same as the lads... - The same thing. Well. But first we will have to formalise things. Wait for me until after the second show. - It's all much better, eh? - Yes, but why? Because magnetism is more gentle. It's all much better, there are no headaches. But there are drugs that don't cause headaches. Yes, but what does it matter? Sign here please? Good evening everybody! Be seated, Good. Sit. Sit. Very good. Now relax a little. Let's see. We're going to loosen up our muscles and pull in your legs. Do you understand? - Are you from Recoleta? - No, I'm from this side of the Central Station. Now close your eyes. I thought you were from Recoleta. No, I am of Quinta Normal. That's a nice area. Lots of trees. Silence. Relaxation. Lots of relaxation. Did you come for a special reason? No, I just want to see some friends. I came because of the problem on the railways, to see what I could find out. Did you see the ad in the newspaper? Very good. Concentration. Concentrate, because you can't do anything in life without concentration. The only tense part of your body must be your legs. Now, beneath your feet you feel a deep hole open up. Understand? And now you're going to feel that you're falling. Understand? - Yes sir. That ball you can see in the distance is the earth. That's where we're going. What's the problem on the railway? The funds were stolen last year. Then there's the problem of the 1980 World Cup. Fine. Now, when I clap three times you will all open your eyes. One... two... three! Right, and so that you don't go there empty-handed I'd like you to take these trays. Bon voyage! Boys, good trip. Welcome. How was your trip? - Very good. - I am very pleased. - Thank you. - My compliments In the name of the members of the Social Club of Chile, With your permission, I'd like to ask the Secretary General of the Club to say a few words. Please. - Very kind. Thank you very much. Gentlemen, thank you. Mr Waldo Martinez Quevenca. Gentlemen of the Social Club of Chile Ladies and Gentlemen. It is for us a source of great pride once more to be able to receive a group of citizens from this now-distant country, who have selflessly come to visit us, in turn we have dedicated a large part of our lives to the in-depth study of the customs and practices of these people. We have had more than a few difficulties in organising their visits, but the persistence of our members and the enthusiasm of the people responsible for giving the go-ahead, so to speak, have overcome the indifference and the ridicule of certain others. And that is why, we can say, without boasting, that we are the only club to receive visits of this standard more than once a week. And for this reason we can be proud to have had such guests as: Luis Gatica, Arturo Godoy, Huasos Quincheros, Eduardo Frei, Sonia and Miriam, Sergio Livingstone and many others. Today we welcome a young poet, an enterprising gas-fitter, and a distinguished civil servant. Please give a warm welcome! On behalf of the foreign delegation, we will have a speach from Mr Waldo Martinez. I would like to thank you for your kind words about us. They are too much for my modest person. I do not believe we really deserve this homage, but I believe if we could deserve it, it would not be simply on behalf of this small group, but an behalf of all of Chile. I would like to thank you on behalf of our far-off country. And I would like to offer a small gift to the Secretary General. An object made of copper and typical of Chile... ...well not entirely, but it contains a little of the craftsmenship of my country. Thank you very much. Now Ladies and Gentlemen there will be a variety. You must not say 'variety'. - What do you say? - You say 'show'. Listen we work hard. For the next independence Day we've invited the Presendent of Chile between '76 and '82. Would you like to come and have a look, colleague? - What is it about me? - What sort of vibes are those, sir? - You don't say 'vibes' - What's wrong, a hair in the soup? Here everything's wrong. This is not Chile! It has nothing to do with anything. - Nobody's forcing you to stay. - Precisely! So I'm going. - Aren't you staying to dance the cueca? - What, only with men? - No, the women are in the kitchen. - That's wrong! It's not like in Chile. Goodbye, I'm leaving. - But the photo? What about the photo. In Chile people are rarely photographed. Then why didn't your colleagues object? - They're not Chileans. Anyway, you don't say 'they didn't object', you say 'they refused'. Nobody objected, not Eduardo Frey, Arturo Godoy, Lucio Gatica... Those photos are fakes. Anyway I want to leave because I'm getting angry. - The staircase is this way... - I know the way. I'll go on my own. Doesn't it interest you to know, what they'll think of you in the year 2065? What historians will say? - Historians? - Of course! - How do I get out? - Across the roof. Why don't you stay until tomorrow? Thanks, but I have a lot of things to do. I have to send a short story to the competition in the 'El Sur' newspaper. - It is a very important competition. - Sure. - How will I do? - You rogue! - You don't say 'rogue'. How's it going? - Good morning, are you lunching alone? - That's right. Well if you don't mind we can sit together. - Why not. I was expecting some friends, but it doesn't matter. How are your friends? - Yes, all fine. - I'm glad. Good morning everybody! How are you, how did it go? - What are you talking about? - Who, me? - No, me. I'm good. - Shall we have lunch together? - Of course, it's sad lunching alone Miss! Now, with your permission, I think I'll go and lie down. Why don't we go to your house? - We're just going. - Many thanks. No, don't worry. Order what you like just talk to the waitress. Well, let's go. - Wait a minute. - What for? Let's go! Hang on. - Did she paste the arse to chair? On your feet, boy! - No. - No? Have you forgetten the contract? Don't you recognise your own signature? - No. - No? Look at it properly. You want to respect the agreements? - Do you mind if I smoke? Now we are serious. Do you want to stay? Well? Have the mice eaten your tongue? I don't know you. Tell me something. If you are afraid, why didn't you run away earlier? Where to? The country is so small! - Why didn't you leave the country then? - For tax reasons. - And now you want to be released? - Of course. Tell me something Which country is it that has... are you listening? Which country has the most beautiful mountains, the best wines, and the most beautiful women? - Italian Switzerland. - Fine. Take a little of this wine. Now, tell me something Which country has earthquakes... but the people bear them because the people are heroic? - Greece. - And the bluest skies? - Mexico. - And the prettiest flag? - Texas. Take a little of this white wine… Do you mind it dry? - Cheers. - Have another. - We must finish this wine. If you don't answer I'll take you with me. What does the Pope think of Chile? It went though his mind when the Cardinal died. - And what did God say? - Nobody knows. - Do you like the wine? - It's Chilean. - Cheers then! - Just a moment, an Argentine wine please? - Malbec. - This one's no good. - Have you got a radio? - Ah yes I'm sorry. - Can we listen to it? - Yes, listen all you want. Well lad, Cheers! May you never lose your tongue. - There's a long way to go... - Cheers then! - Cheers then! - Cheers, and I gain a point. - Go right ahead. - Tell me, do you want to save yourself? Stay silent, if you like. - If I keep quiet, you lose. Ah, don't frighten me, if you do, you're finnished. - I'm afraid. - Another point off. - You lied to me. - Not this time. Cheers then! Excuse me. - Excuse me - What is it? This gentleman wants to talk about the godfather. - Pleased to meet you. - A pleasure to meet you. - Is this going to go on much longer? - More than an hour, I'm afraid. Lets' continue. Please excuse me. - What do you do in life? - I'm a poet and a public official. - Do you have social security? - Of course. - Where are your poems? - All here, I don't publish them. - What use is it to write? - I get an urge to read. What's good about reading? It's the duty of a citizen to know how to read and write to be able to serve the nation with a sound body and soul. I can already see you in heaven, full of majesty and glory. I swear it makes me want to yawn, when your memory fails you. Asked for three hours Asked for three hours Juicitino with malice. With ten bottles of wine Chile got drunk. When the bad man saw him said: 'this verse is for me'. 'And here I don't move without him drunk on white and red wine'. For my memory to fail, and for it not to make you yawn, let us sail together to glory in this bottle... I'm not afraid of sailing to glory, but I already know my Chilean wine off by heart! Finish off your tale, wind up your nonsense. I'm sure this wine is better than that in Cuio. The idea that Chilean wine is good, is old history now, because after a time it turns to water. Chilean wine is like water. What have you got against water? I'll beat you with a stick instead of sending you to heaven. Sticks now is it! And you with your tradition! If the moment presented itself, just like Caupolican, you'd turn into a stick. After midnight. Viva Chile! The devil said I don't get tired because I don't come from Bariloche. We went out in the night, me and my companion. to drink and eat at the expense of Chilotes. They'll be dragged down to hell by thier hair and neck. The Chileans are all dwarfs, why is that? It's the volcanic air. - In Chile there's tuberculosis. - Because of the volcanic air. - They're all dead to start with! - Not true! The horses are dwarfs, the trees are dwarfs. It's the volcanic air, it's not Chile's fault. - Have a little brandy. - I couldn't. It's the volcanic air! Where are we? What world are we in? We're here. Let us welcome the prodigal son! - May I ask for a round of applause? - Continue with the applause! Bravo! Which hospital are we in? - The Saviour, nothing more or less. - But it's not so bad. And which ward is this one? Intoxication… what's this called? The 'Anti-alcoholic Detoxification Clinic'. Very necessary too. - I overdid it a bit. - That's why we're all here. Hello. - And the Argentine? - Who? The Argentine, the one who sings boleros… The devil you say! He behaved very badly with us, that guy isn't joking. May God preserve us! - What happened to you? - What happened to whom? We've come from different places. - What happened to us with whom? - I don't know, with the devil! Oh, it was fine. Pretty good. Did you see the motorway? - No, I came back straight away. Me neither, but they told me about it. They say it's fabulous. The important thing is the progress in the agricultural sector. The submarine cities are important too. - Lots of red wine. The walls are of camphor wood... the rivers are of brandy... ...the sand is flour. It's very pleasant. Very beautiful. I liked the mountains. The mountain range is covered in mussels. I didn't see anything because I came away at once. We were ok. Chile will have a border with Colombia. But I knew our troops would reach Buenos Aires. How will we do at football? There won't be any football. The stadiums will be used to grow milanese lettuces. Trees... trees, they plant trees. Cauliflowers for the schools. No trees, because they are too expensive. They can't be expensive because there's no money. There are U.S. dollars. They plant trees in the stadiums. Lots of fruit trees... lots of orange trees. Aranci and mandarins. Lemons, pears, grapefruit and citrus... All the citrus fruits. Good afternoon everybody! I've brought you some fruit. Attention! Everybody watch out! Make the sign of the Cross Eat the fruit yourself! Beat it you bastard! Stuff it up your arse! You son-of-a-bitch! Argentines are cowards! Bastard! Get him! Go! Get out! Run! Fire! Help! SANTIAGO 10 OCTOBER 1965. That is why I believe I am not betraying the traditional austerity and sobriety with which the people of Chile express their most profound sentiments of grief, when I ask, not without personal feeling, all my compatriots for a brief moment, though no less significant for being brief, to suspend the activities which throughout the nation give life to our democracy, to accompany on the last stage of their journey this handful of compatriots and exemplary citizens, whose humble but dignified lives, have been tragically cut short. I know that in my words and feelings as the President, I am reflecting our countries great respect for its own traditions. I repeat, I am embodying the feelings of so many Chileans wounded by misfortune. So many inhabitants of this country, where citizens are with tragic frequency, the victims of a hostile environment, of a difficult, and at times bitter, destiny, which the nation knows how to face bravely and responsibly.
