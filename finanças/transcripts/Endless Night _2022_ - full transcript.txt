[eerie music] -You sure it's safe? -[Sébastien] Sure, it's from the clinic. [Pauline] But what does it do? Sleeping pills are not that fun. Guys, trust me, I've done it before. We just gotta stay together. No one leaves the room. [Théo] Come on, let's stop stalling. Huh? Too bad if you're wimps. Alright. [scoffs] [mysterious music] [ominous music] [dog barks in distance] [moans] [ominous music continues] [snorts] [distorted crackling] [buzz] [distorted crackling continues] [buzzing] [distorted crackling continues] [squishing] [ominous music intensifies] [distorted splash] [ominous music fades out] -Dude, wake up. Where's Pauline? -What? -Guys, wake up. Where's Pauline? -What? -[shouting] Pauline! Pauline! -Pauline? [Théo] Pauline! By the pool! [all] Pauline! [ominous music] [Naïma gasps] [Clément whimpers] [panting] [exhales] [ominous note] Shall we? No. I wanna do it on my own today. You sure? Yes, I'm sure. [all applauding and cheering] Stop it. -[Sébastien] Slow down. -Come here. [Naïma giggles] [Pauline grunts] See? I told you. Take this. [sighs] -Good thing you're here. -Yeah, yeah. I don't know how to say it, but I'm so sorry. What for? Bringing that shit back from the clinic. [scoffs] Are you kidding? I can't wait to do it again. [scoffs] It was, like… It was crazy. [intense music] 6 MONTHS LATER… [waves rumbling] [mysterious music] [in Japanese] Help me, Dad. [gasps] [sighs] [eerie music] I'll be home around 8. Love you, mom. -[car alarm] -[dog barking] [Idris in distance] Hurry! [footsteps approaching rapidly] [Idris] Quick! This way! [Clément] Come on! Fuck! [Pauline] Seb, hurry up! [ominous music] [Sébastien panting heavily] [suffocating] Hey you! Come help me drag him! [Naïma] Go on! [dog barking] [barking aggressively] [dog continues barking] -[Eva] What's wrong with him? -Don't worry. It happens. I'm on it. Hey! Seb! Seb, for fuck's sake! Now's not the time. We're gonna draw attention. It's taking too long. -Shall I call 911? -No! He gave me a number to call for emergencies. ONEIROY SLEEP CLINIC [Sébastien] Can I go home? -I'm okay. -[Hélène] No, you're not. It took you an hour to come round. -Does this ring a bell? -[pills rattling] We have a lot of theft and found traces of this in your blood. I don't know, maybe… -Maybe your test was wrong-- -Don't give me that. Icelotropin is only administered here and in very specific cases. Alright, I took… -I only took two pills to try them. -To try them? Not only is that theft, but it's dangerous for you. -Are you going to rat me out? -No, I'm here to help. But if you do it again, I won't let it pass. [Eva] What happened? I thought narcoleptic attacks were harmless and you just woke up. Dunno. Must depend on the person. What exactly is this place? The OSC. A center specialized in sleep disorders. It has a great rep. Heaven for sleepwalkers and narcoleptics. -Like Sébastien? -Yeah, like Seb. He knows this place inside out and the nurses love him. [snorts] -You just moved here with your parents? -Just my mom. My dad died six months ago. -Oh, I'm sorry. -It's okay, you didn't know. You starting at De Nerval on Monday? -High school? Yeah. -What year? -Senior. -Me too. -You stressed? -Being the new kid just sucks. Girls, go home, we're keeping him under observation. We can't see him? We've waited two hours. No, he needs to rest. Go home, get some sleep. Great. Wanna see a really weird guy? Like, Seb is nothing compared to him. Come, it'll be fun. Wait, we can't just walk in! Chill! We won't disturb him, for sure. [door creaks] [eerie music] [heart monitor beeping steadily] [Eva] Why are we here? He's been asleep for ten years. Yeah, right. You're fucking with me. No. I swear. Seb told me. He's been asleep all this time. It's incredible. He's never left this room, never got up. So, he's in a coma. [Naïma] No. Why would he be here, then? He's just asleep. It's crazy, right? Seb and I often come see him. Freak each other out in his room. [heart monitor beeping steadily] [whispers] Romain? [loud beeping] [Naïma] What did you do? Let's get the hell out of here! Come on! [loud beeping continues] [Eva] You think we woke him? -[Naïma] Wanna go back and check? -No, not really. Going home's gonna suck. Why? Are your parents strict? No, they're fine. It's my baby sisters. They'll never let me sleep. What about you? Your par-- your mom won't be mad? She's not home yet. I just need to be in bed when she gets in. -Does she work nights? -Yeah, she's a flight attendant. And since we just got here, her shifts are all over the place. Okay, well, see you. -[baby crying in distance] -See you. Sleep well. [door opens then shuts] [Florence] I shouldn't have woken you. Huh? Trouble sleeping again? I'm fine. I need to adjust, anyhow. -Why aren't you in bed? -Tomorrow's the first day of school. -I got your supplies. -I thought we were going together? Well, it's done now. I didn't want to brave the Sunday afternoon crowds. Here, I got you this. -You don't like it? -No, it's great. [Florence] Yeah, I should have gone to bed. [mysterious music] [TV program] [Eva] Sébastien? I'm not disturbing you? Not at all. [Eva] I was in the area. I wanted to see how you were. You know someone else here? No, but it was so weird last night, I wanted to be sure that-- [Sébastien] That I was real? I wasn't sure I'd really seen you, either. At least you recognize me. -I don't even know your name. -Eva. Eva. I'm gonna go. I guess your family will be here soon. No, that's unlikely. Wanna sit? Well, you've already seen me in my jammies. We have TV. So, we've kinda started with the end… -We could turn back time and meet earlier? -Okay. Hello. Sébastien Fermi. Nice to meet you. -Eva. -Nice to meet you, Eva. -What do you do, Eva? -[Eva giggles] [laughs] Not much. [giggles] -[indistinct chattering] -[girls scream excitedly] [school bell rings] [teacher] Like at the start of every year, please fill out the form with your parents' names and professions. Thank you. [boy] Thank you. FATHER [girl] Thank you. Hello. You got a pen? [boy chuckles] [chuckles] [indistinct chattering] [Idris] Can I see? Wanna be my model? -[Idris] What? -Wanna pose for me? -Don't be shy. -Yeah, right. [Pauline] I swear, you've got a great body. Well balanced. I can design something that'll suit you. -I could be a model. -Totally. [chuckles] -What's up? -Don't wanna help your brother instead? -Him? Can't even look at him. -[Clément] Sucks, amigo. [Naïma] Poor babies. They're not in the same class. -Breakups are hard. You'll get over it. -Check it out. What's that? -It was his mom's when she was 12. -[both chuckle] So, you're in Eva's class? -Yeah. -Who's Eva? The girl who helped me with Seb the other night, while you ran off with Prince Charming. -Shut up. -[Clément] Well, I loved it. Lucky the guy with his dog didn't catch us. Mid-trip, too. What's up, buddies? -What's up? -All good? -Feeling better? -Same old. They didn't keep me long. Didn't you say Eva came back to see you yesterday? Yeah, she did. Like, alone? She could have asked me to go. -What did she want? -Nothing… To see how I was. -[Pauline] Did she ask about us? -Here we go again. [Pauline] What? I'm allowed to ask. She didn't ask me anything about Icelotropin. -If that's what you mean. -[Naïma] There she is. -I'm gonna say hi. -We have to talk about the clinic. -[babbles mockingly] -[all giggle] Is that Eva? Weird, no? You think everyone's weird. [Naïma] Honestly, she's cool. She won't talk. I spent the night with her at the clinic. She seems really nice. -You're into her. -[both chuckle] [suspenseful music] -Show me? Thanks. -Here. Did you give her the drill? [sighs] Talking to patients is your job, not mine. The scan room is ready. -She's had three SAs, so take it easy. -Okay. [Hélène] Here. The white pill will help you sleep, and the blue one will activate your paradoxical sleep, in which you dream. These machines help us to see what's going on in here. -I've told you all about my dreams. -[Hélène] Yes, but they're only memories. When I listen to you tell me a story, I tell myself another. We may lose important things along the way. Thanks to the pill and the scan, we have direct access to your dreams. -Like a movie? -[Hélène] In a way, yes. Except not as sharp. [machine beeping] [whirring] [hypnotic music] [Valentin] She's just entered paradoxical sleep. It's going to get clearer. We have something. [hypnotic music continues] [music stops] -What were you listening to? -Something I'm working on. -You make music? -A little. On the computer. -Can I listen? -We're not close enough yet. Where were you six months ago? Why? Do I need an alibi? No, but I thought you and I could abolish time. That's right. Um… Six months ago… I was at the beach, taking a walk. You? Six months ago… I was asleep. At the clinic or in my building lobby? I sleep in my bed, too, you know. At this time? There is no time. True. -Aren't you going to class? -Yes. Just really late. [chuckles] Like today. Yeah. [eerie music] [eerie music playing on computer] It's really cool. -What's the title? -Usually, it's the first thing I think of. [music stops] [Sébastien chuckles] -It's… -Sorry. -No, it's not you. -Really, it's… I'm sorry. Can I listen again? Sure. [eerie music resumes playing] [coach] Come on, forward! Defense! Come on, pass it! Yeah! [all] Yeah! -See how I faked you out? -Yeah. -I gave it my all, too. -[Naïma giggles] I tutor, you know, 30 euros an hour. You in? -I'm alright. -Okay. I shouldn't tell you this, but… Seb really likes you. And I wanted to know if you were into him or… I'm sorry? Don't tell him I told you, but… we spoke on the phone yesterday and… he seemed kinda disappointed, so… -I know it's none of my business. -No, it's not. Did I ask what you were all doing the other night? [door opens then shuts] [Théo] Got some gifts for you guys. Here, size 12. -You're crazy! -And for Naïma. -Sweet! Where did you get them? -Through my dad's client. -I'll spare you the details. -Dope. Thanks. -You're welcome. -Is that it? Dude, I'm sorry. I had nothing from the last century so… [scoffs] -I'm wretched, my Lord. -[Naïma laughs] [Pauline] What about me? Don't I get anything? -[Idris] He ain't messing around. -Wow. -[Clément] Oh, wow, plastic. -Nice necklace. -Amazing. -And the leash? -At least I don't look like a poodle. -[laughs] -[Naïma barks] -Don't listen to them, babe. I love it. -No worries. And now, Seb's gift. -Sorry, no gift from me. -What? [Théo] What do you mean? You spent two days there. -Didn't you get any? -I got caught. So we gotta make do with what's left. -You got caught? What do they know? -Nothing, but they're onto me. -You're freaking useless! -[Sébastien] Why don't you go? Or ask your dad to buy you a clinic. -What did you say? -I said ask your dad. Don't fight over this shit. [Clément] Calm down. We've still got some. [Sébastien] I'm out of here. [Théo] Oh, I see. Go run after your girlfriend! Eva? You okay? Looks like a fun vibe. No, no, that's Théo. We… We were just talking. You seem to talk to Naïma a lot, too. What do you mean? Talk about me all you want, but I don't wanna hear it. [suspenseful music] [whirring] Why scan him after all these years? He's had some brain activity, but never this much. What triggered this? [whispers] Romain… No idea. But it looks like he could wake up soon. [wavering] [mysterious music] -Have you ever seen this? -A still image for this long? No. -[machine beeps] -And never this sharp. Has it frozen? [Valentin] I can reboot, but I don't think-- Look. It's amazing. [ominous music] What the hell? [somber music] [suspenseful music] [overlapping chatter] [chuckles] -[Eva] I saw you at the old train station. -Amazing. I saw you, too. But I didn't tell the others. See, I can keep a secret. Fine, I forgive you. Tell me. I know you're dying to. What do you guys take? Icelotropin. [suspenseful music] [pills rattle] It's a pill I get from the clinic. It makes your dreams crazy intense. You're supposed to take it with a sleeping pill, but without it, the effect is… It's more than a drug. It's… It's a journey. It's a completely crazy experience. [chuckles] [eerie music] After a while, when you're still awake… something happens… and your dreams mix with reality. The world around you still exists, but… but it mirrors your dreams. You fully let go, but at the same time, you control everything. [stars swishing] [whoosh] -You dream awake. -Exactly. When you're really into your dream… reality is… [chuckles] gorgeous. [dark music] [thrilling transcendent music] [camera shutters clicking] [thrilling transcendent music continues] [water gurgling] [car horns blaring] [Eva] No bad trips? We had a few mishaps at the start, when we couldn't make out dreams from reality. -[Eva] But you didn't stop? -[Sébastien] We know how to manage it now. I swear. We're getting stronger. I wanna come with you. I wanna try it. -I don't know if we'll do it again. -What do you mean? We've run out. And given what happened at the clinic last time, I'm not sure I can get anymore. [eerie music playing in headphones] [Sébastien's voice] It's a pill I get from the clinic. It makes your dreams crazy intense. You fully let go, but at the same time, you control everything. [suspenseful music] [panting] [machines beeping] [threatening music] -[gasps] -[ominous grinding] [echoing thud] [ominous music] [ominous grinding] [screaming] [screaming continues] [in Japanese] I can't do it anymore. I don't have the strength. [gasps] [sinister high-pitched hissing] [gasps] [mysterious music] [ominous music] [ominous music crescendo] [sinister high-pitched hissing] [intense music] Subtitles by: Juliette Avery
