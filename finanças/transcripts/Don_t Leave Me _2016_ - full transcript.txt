This film was made before the Paris attacks on Friday 13 November 2015 In his time, Malraux declared the task of the 21st century would be to restore religion to mankind. Along with this agnostic, I conclude that only a renewal of religions, the religions which offer a light to guide people on the path away from evil, can give our country the spirit it needs to help it accept its diversity. Thank you, Ms Aitoudi. Let's see Ms Pietri. - Have you got her X-rays? - Yes. - Her liver tests? - I did them, but I... I need the TP-TCK. Wait. - I'll get the results. - OK. Hello? Yes. So, how did it go? They asked me about French identity. I said something personal. - When will the results be out? - About 5pm. - Will you call me? - No. Promise? Sure. Bye. - Bye. - Take care. - So? - It's OK, never mind. You're going to Sciences-Po. This is a massive mistake. Put this on. Are you serious? Help me. You're invisible. Are you sure? Come on. Don't abandon me - Hello. Are you happy? - Yes. I've waited days for this. You take care of him? Like I do my wife and son. OK. Ready? I, Abderrahmane, accept this marriage. Are we married now? By the will of Allah, you are now husband and wife. It's your ring. Imane chose it for you. Like it? I'm coming. I'm so proud to be your wife. Now I just want to be with you. Benji, get her a ticket. It's done. She'll soon be with you. I'm coming. I'm so proud to be your wife. Now I just want to be with you. Benji, get her ticket. It's done. She'll soon be with you. Stop it, Mum. 10th. Not only did you pass the exam, but you came 10th. If you don't stop, I'll cry. Get that, honey. - Chama! - Darlings! I'm wearing the dress you gave me. Darling. Oh my, I'm so proud of you. Congratulations. Amazing. You think you can celebrate without me? Grandma... It brings luck! We needed that, darling. Here, Djemila. There we go. Here. "If thirsty, drink my words", the prophet said. Celebrate your fast with bubbles, I say. Now, Chama, your father expects you to be more than a lawyer. They'll fight over you. The court of human rights, the UN... First let her come on holiday with me to Greece. I can't wait. - The present? - Give it to her. We thought it might be useful. It was the best one. Don't you like it? Yes, but it's too nice, that's all. - Yes? - Hello. Sorry to bother you. Adrien Saugier. Is this your daughter? - What's this? - My son is Louis. He and your daughter got married via internet. What? My son converted to Islam. He's in Syria now. Your daughter's planning to join him. - Don't let her. - Stop it. Please talk to her. She'll lie to you. Take the photo. My name's on the back. Go away. You know now. What's going on? Don't say there's an emergency. My only emergency's my daughter. You look strange. What's wrong? Who was that? No one. A wrong address. Emphasise the A more. Great. That's very good. - You're teaching her Arabic? - Good. She doesn't need me. She's learning on her own. It's in her blood. - You're taking lessons? - By internet. To talk to who? Who will she talk to, except me? The more languages the better, no? Sure. I'm just surprised. Aren't you being a bit of a possessive mother? - The evening's spoiled. - She's annoyed. - It was cool, no? - Very. - You'd tell me if you had a problem? - Yes, why? I don't know. With your exam, we haven't had much time to talk. I miss that. You'll have to miss it a bit longer. I'm off to bed. Islam and radicalization: social workers' alarm Stop jihadism Helping victims of sectarianism - You slept here? - Yes. Champagne keeps me awake. Alcohol is a poison. You didn't eat the kebabs. - I've become a vegetarian. - That's new. Yes. The Holy Koran Why didn't you tell me? I don't know. I was in shock. You mean you wanted to handle it alone. Am I on trial? I've checked it out. It all fits. Vegetarian means she's eating halal. Learning Arabic, not telling me. She loves swimming. She doesn't swim any more. She stays in her room for hours. We must know. There's a password. Found anything? She's got another profile. "Mujahida Surya." - Her nick? - Yes. "Suraya the fighter." Can you believe it? Oh, fuck... Dad? Why are you here? What's this, Chama? - You've been nosing around? - You're Mujahida Surya? I've nothing to hide, luckily. What's this? - My research. - Your research? For Sciences-Po. On jihad. Young people leaving, like you read in the media. A topic for the oral. You prepare exams by contacting terrorists? If you don't play the game, they won't talk. Why all this fuss? You know me. And this Abderrahmane? I met him a few times at parties. I heard he'd gone to Syria, with Omar, from my school. Just like that. I wanted to understand. Tell us the truth. I look awful. You find it funny? What can happen to me behind a screen? You can marry a convert who wants to get you over there. What's that? A new ring. Like it? It's a wedding ring, Chama! Fuck! Anyway, it's better like this. I can't stand you, you vile unbelievers. What? You say you believe, but you don't follow the true faith! - Listen to yourself? - You're worse! Divorced, you smoke and drink! You disgust me! But it's finished now. I'll live in purity in the caliphate. Chama, are you crazy? No. You two are crazy. Chama! Ring the bell. I was hoping you'd come. Come in. Excuse me. I search for my son all day long on social media, in the press, via associations... I cross check them all. Have you found him? Sometimes I identify his group, but always too late. Did he drag Chama in? I don't know who encouraged the other. My son loved music. He'd come here with friends to listen to it. Chama often came. You met her? I thought they were just friends. You knew she had a boyfriend? No. I can't believe it. I'll show you. Your wedding ring. Imane chose it for you. Like it? I'm coming. I'm so proud to be your wife. I just want to be with you. Benji, get her a ticket. It's done. She's coming to you soon. I'm sorry. If your daughter joins my son, he won't come back. Who'd she go with? With what money? They have money. I know how they organize it. I can help. We don't need anyone to tell us. No internet, stop her seeing people, take her away. I have a place. Isolation's the solution? It's the only way to get her back. If I'd done that, my son would still be here. Come on. He's been searching for a month. He knows what to do. He's paranoid! Did you see the wall? - We'd be the same. - We're not the same. Chama's under age! We'll bar her from going abroad. - Tell the police? - Yes. She'll be filed as an extremist. Are you mad? You hear of kids on file who still cross the border. Don't you know? What do you want to do? Watch over her 24/7 in his house? I don't trust him. - I don't want you to report her. - Chama won't go there. Don't bother, I have the key. You're against me too? I thought you loved me. Not right now. Where's your... political conscience? What conscience? The lies, racism and pornography of the West? You like a woman's body to be imprisoned in a hijab? Girls' hands cut off for learning to write? You watch too much TV. You've forgotten God. Do those crazy beheaders pray better than me? I'm starving. Let's order pizza. You destroy us, and you can eat? - Is it forbidden? - You want my phone? Phone yourself, if you don't trust me. Number? 01 41... 09 12. Sweet Pizza. Hello. Hello. Hold the line. Yes. One oriental pizza, please. Did you talk to her? It's as bad as you said. And the man? I'd be just as lost as he is, if Chama had gone. I keep imagining her, among those horrors. Shall I stay? Thanks, but I need to talk to her. Come. Changing of the guard? Mehdi's waiting outside. Thanks. This is awful. Can't we try to make peace? I'm not at war, just destroyed. She forgot something? Hello. One oriental pizza? You called for it? Paranoia again. Grandma called. I have no phone. Thanks. 13 euros, please. - Keep the change. - Thanks. Want some? We don't usually order from them. The others didn't answer. You didn't get 4 cheeses? - Is oriental suspicious? - You said you were vegetarian. Sorry for what I said. I didn't mean it. You didn't ask where we went. We went to Adrien's. Louis Saugier's father. You know him? Give me that! "Sonia Ziouche." A new photo. - How can you do this? - You don't own me! I'll go. My brothers won't let me down. How about going somewhere, you and I? Bashar uses chemical weapons on innocents. They rape women, kill children. And we do nothing. I prefer to go there and risk my life. What have you done? What's in it? Slowly. Come on. Slowly. - OK? - Yes. - How long will she sleep? - Till the morning. We'll take the luggage in. - We'll fetch her later. - OK. - I'll take that. - Thanks. - You're alone here? - Yes. I nearly sold the house when my wife died, but Louis liked coming here. We'll put her on the first floor. OK. I'll show you how the alarm works. - Come in. - Thanks. In√®s, it's me. Call me back, please. OK? The kitchen. I'll show you how the alarm works. It's easy to remember. 14... 18. It's all connected. The advantage of getting burgled. No one comes here. You're safe. I hope so. Here are the keys. Do you realize what I've done to her? I want your phone and tablet. - I can't hand my phone over. - In that case, we'll leave. I'll give you them when you need them. It's tapped, since I reported Louis to the police. You talk to him? At first I called him 10 times a day. He never answered. I'll make a fire. Maybe I gave him too much freedom. I did something wrong. I was always after her. No boyfriend, she didn't go out, she was always studying. I don't get it. I don't see how she could've turned to such horrors. I'll help you as much as I can. Can you hear me? How do you feel? We're at Louis's, out of town. His father's here too. Gently now. You drugged me, confined me. Slowly, slowly. Have a drink. Here. Chama! Wait! It's no use! - It's no use! - Let me go! - Calm down! - Let me go! Here. Drink some. - We must talk. - I don't talk to Charlies. "Charlies"? Are you joking? You were keen to go on that march! - Wake up, Chama! - I'm awake! Allah woke me up! I fight for the oppressed. I spit on those who humiliate God. - This anger's not like you. - Anger? I was angry at school. Remember? They didn't like Arabs doing well. There are idiots everywhere. Chama, you were above all that. That's what you told me. I can't forget Grandpa. What's he got to do with it? A wog, a dirty Arab... That's what they called him when he got here. Yet he was a doctor, the most civilised of men. Honey, you're mixing things up. Your grandpa asked for asylum. It was complicated. Without the French, he'd have been murdered. But he was murdered! The humiliation made him ill! And you became a doctor to avenge him, right? But you've forgotten. You sold your soul. So what shall we do? - Kill everyone? - I'm getting out. I'm getting out. You can all die here, for your sins. Oh my God, she's done it... What? In√®s has taken Chama to that guy's place. Fucking hell. Shit... In√®s, it's me. We need to meet. Call me soon, please. Yes, Mehdi? No, listen. - It was urgent. - What? There was a fake passport in a pizza. Wait, I'll call you back! Chama! Chama! Chama! - Hello? Hello! - Chama! Hello? In√®s? Chama! Stop! Let me in! Let me in! Open the door! - Open! - What's going on? - Please! - It's OK. It's my daughter. Stop it! Chama, stop it. I won't let you ruin your life. I'll smash the place up. You're talking of killing people. Pigs that offend the prophet. Your new friends are pigs. And Louis. Abderrahmane. My husband. You have no husband. You have no wedding ring. Chama, stop it! Chama... - What have you done? - Leave me alone. - Let me deal with it. - Don't touch me! Until I speak to my husband... - Let me go... Wait. - You're crazy! Shit! What are you doing? You're crazy. You won't leave. Hello? - Louis? - Yes, it's me. Good to hear you. - Are you OK? - Yes. - Where's my wife? - Your wife? What wife? I want to talk to her. OK. - And you'll come back? - That depends on you. Louis? What happened? I bought food for a siege. Sorry to ask this. I'd do the same. Orphan parents - Hello. - Hello. Girl or boy? What? Your child's been radicalized. Yes. A girl. Her name's Chama. All parents feel guilty. Teenage fragility makes our children extremists' targets. She's so strong. As soon as a teenager complains: "No one understands, I hate my parents", new friends get in touch and pretend to sympathise: "Same here." Day after day, more and more of them sympathize. Like in a cult. Saying it's normal, they've been chosen. But she's got a good brain. She's not the type. They speak to her heart, her frustrations, not to her intelligence. You need to show affection. Treat her like the child she was, the person she is. Remind her of what she cares about. Tell her you love her. I'd keep saying I love her all day long, if it would help. Manon, how are you? I'm leaving hospital and going to my mother's. Great. It'll be OK. Manon came back. At first she couldn't go out. She thought the devil would take her. Sorry, I must answer. Hello? Here's a sandwich. Eat it. Can I phone my husband? - Can I treat your arm? - Can I phone? I just want to understand. - Let's read together. You explain. - Nothing to explain. They say: "Sacrifice yourself with us, "you'll defend a good cause." In fact, you'll discover hell on earth and die alone, far from home. They say: "Marry one of our heroes." In fact, you'll bring up kids in fear. - I've added sugar. - Thanks. I can't believe she doesn't realize the horror. They think it's American or Zionist propaganda. Louis wants you. - Where's Mum? - I made her sleep. We don't have long. You're a bastard, pretending to be a victim. Abderrahmane was right. I could tell my mother. Surya, at last! I didn't abandon you. Louis, I found her, right? - Give me that! - You married her. Come back. Your place is with her! Come back! Surya, listen. You must escape. Did I sleep? Just half an hour. Chama's still in her room. Are you OK? - Do you want a drink? - No, thanks. - Here. - Call me when you want. - If you need me. - Thanks. Sorry for keeping you waiting. Lieutenant Logley. Why am I here? Do you go to the mosque? Er... Yes, sometimes. I'm asking you this for a reason. - What's that? - A doll with no face. Islamists give them to their kids. Other dolls are forbidden. They offend God's image. So...? Your kids brought it to school. They say other dolls burn in hell. The school called social services, who told us. Hang on. You're saying I've indoctrinated my kids? I say nothing. I just do my job. Can you explain? You talked to Adrien? If you don't let me treat your arm, I'll make you sleep again. When I wake up, I'll burn my feet. They brainwashed me for months. When I got into Sciences-Po, they'd lost. So she drugged me, locked me up. Please don't leave me with them. This is nonsense. You must see that. Recognize anyone? No one. We can check, Chama. We have your computer's IP address, you know. I'm sure. Will you look at these photos? That one. He delivered the pizza with the fake passport. - Are you sure? - Yes. I can't forget him. How do you explain the fact a call to Syria was made from your tablet 2 hours ago? No. It's not possible. I... I... It was Adrien. - Adrien Saugier? - Yes. Am I right? He got you to talk to Louis? Chama? You know the penalty for defending terrorism? 5 years in jail and a fine of 75,000 euros. Don't make things worse. Tell us all now. Fuck off. Look at me. Don't you know me? You know, Chama, your brother and sister love you. Louisa copies you all the time. How could you do that to them? Do what? Keep them from sin? Rubbish! Wake up. How do your illiterate friends read the Koran? In Arabic? In French? Upside down? How could you think for one minute that what they say about Islam is true? Answer me. I'm a good Muslim, Chama. You know why? Every day, I try to be happier. Every day, I try to be better. It's so easy. In your cosy life as an IT engineer, going shopping on Saturday with your 2 kids. First, I have three kids. And it's not easy. Not when you see what Daesh does. Chama? Let me hold you. It'll take a long time to forget. Give me your hands. Let me go. - Let me go. - What do you mean? I won't let you go! I won't! Look at me! - Let me go, Dad! - "Dad"? You remembered? "Dad"! Fucking hell! "Dad"! Finally you remembered? Let me go... Give me your hand. Give me your hand, Chama. Yes. And the kids? OK. No. I'll stay here tonight. Take care. Are you OK? Djemila won't let Chama visit. I understand her. How could I have trusted that guy? I'm scared, Mehdi. I feel like we've already lost. No, no. We'll win. OK? You'll stay the In√®s I know, who can move mountains. OK? And that food's going to be burnt. Shit! And your work? It's complicated. We need to see what to do now. I can't risk taking her home. We'll find another place. Shouldn't I take her some food? She'll eat when she's hungry. You said that when she wouldn't eat baby food. You brought all this? Even her comfort blanket? My house doctor's cap. Nora, at the association, told me we have to reconcile her with her past, her memories. I am Charlie Having fun? Hell... Ah, Louis. My Louis. Why did the cops attack my brothers? I don't know your brothers. You're lying again. You must help my wife to come to me. You won't come back? I don't know how. My phone's tapped. Her parents know I betrayed them. Again, you sound so weak. Set her free. I'll tell you where to find me. I promise. It's your last chance to see me. Well? OK, I'll do it. - OK. Be strong. - Don't worry. We're together now. I'll find another house. And I'll ask for leave so I can stay with you. I'll call you. - Thanks. - OK? How many times I found you eating the dog's food! Dogs are dirty. You were scared of the dark. You used to frighten nurses by hiding under my desk. Remember? You used to make them jump. OK, you can call Louis, but let me treat your hand first. Really? The infidel is listening. She locks me up. Did my father help her? Shit... He made trouble for our network. Don't worry, we can cope. Hi, Chama. How are you? We'll win, inshallah! - You see? - You're wounded? - Is that blood? - This? A scratch. We took prisoners. What'll happen to them? You're different. Don't worry. You'll improve here too. I think of you, listen to your music. You listen to music? That's haram! - Just your music. - No music. Listen to silence, you'll hear God. The sisters are waiting for you. They've prepared the best room for us. You said we'd have a house. A house for us? You'll see, this is better. Easier for you to look after the kids. Look after kids? I want a proper job. It is a proper job. The sisters also look for recruits on the internet. You'll be good at that. But I'd rather... I don't know... bear witness, fight. I must go. Think about what I said. Trying to please me? Louis has a place in your heart. Abderrahmane. If you go there, you'll never come back. He's my son. - I'll do anything. - But how? That's my problem. Good luck. Here. What are you up to? I've a surprise for you. Yas! Great to see you. - How's life? - It's Guantanamo. Wait. There's someone else. Here. You've lost weight. I'll make your favourite dish. But I haven't forgotten that faceless doll. Give me a kiss. I'm here when you want to. Add water, to dampen the... What? No, really... Not like that. Like this. Cooking's not your thing. I can't teach you now. I know, it's too late. For months he showed off to her. Then he got her. You should have seen. We got home at 4am. We really miss you. Clubbing's not good. Stop it, Cham. You used to like fun more than getting killed. Clear off. I've had enough. You won't see me again. And I'm the radical? - How's the music academy? - It's hard. My audition's next month. I train my voice every day. I'll add some more. Lend me your phone. You never give up. It's at home. Your mother's orders. Your couscous is good. Better than oriental pizza. I wonder, Cham, if I made so much trouble, would my mum try so hard? The worst poison is not the one that kills, but the one that makes you stupid. Finish off my couscous, OK? See you soon. Promise? When I reach the caliphate I'll bring you over. To live in paradise. With 3rd and 4th wives and loads of kids? That's not my destiny. It wasn't yours either. Shall we go running? I need exercise too. Watch out, I run faster. I'm so hungry. - Want some? - Yes. Your nose is bleeding? It's nothing, I'm just tired. - What's that? - Vitamin C. I hate it when you lie. When I told your teacher you'd sprained your wrist, he was doubtful. But I was a doctor, he couldn't argue. You wouldn't lie. I did it to protect you, my baby. I'm no baby now. Unfortunately. - You? - I need some things. - Don't come in. - Leave me! - I'm going to fetch my son. - Where? - Who cares! - Where is he? Get in the kitchen! Go on! Go on! We'll be leaving soon. As you like. Excuse me. I'm sorry. It's suicide to go there. I prefer that to a phone call telling me he's dead. Sorry. OK. Come. It's OK. What are you looking for? An explosive belt? 1418 code Tonight at the fork What's up? You want to say something? Good night, Mum. It's all organised. I'm taking you. We're going to Syria now? Coming? So, are you proud of me? It feels odd. What do we do now? Imane will be waiting for you. For you, not him. She'll give you papers and a phone. Then you'll drive to Zagreb. You'll take a plane. You'll be met. And your dad? He's not your problem. Today's a big day. You know Omar? He's dead? He's in paradise. Aren't you happy? It's strange. Do you want to die too? Yes. If Allah wills, I'll die. What will I do alone there, if you die? Don't worry. Our brothers and sisters will be with you. I'll get a new husband? You'd like that? You shock me, Surya. You're chosen. You obey, that's all. Don't cry. See you in paradise. I love you, Mum. Chama! Let me say goodbye. Let me kiss you. I love you, darling. Call me back. OK? Call me back. Mehdi, Chama's gone. Lieutenant, she must be with Saugier! He came to the house. She had the alarm code. She's a minor, barred from going abroad. If she gets out, I'll sue you! - Get out. - Where are we going? Your mother's told them. We'll change cars. You want to see Louis? Chama? Don't do this. Let me say goodbye. Let me kiss you. I love you. Give me the phone! - Don't touch me. - They'll find us. - You want to see Louis? - OK. I'll keep it. I'll turn it off. - You told Nora? - Yes. If they move, we'll know. Find anything? Maybe. - What? - Hang on. - Oh, shit. Zagreb. - "Zagreb"? The bastard! OK. Even in Croatia, she needs papers to cross the border. Can you hide the number on an SMS? Of course. Keep away. Cops waiting. Meet at Z Burger. Just Chama No signature. It's scary. Cops. Let's go. We were stupid to think it'd work. He won't come. She must come. Quick. I'm watching. - She's here! - Wait, don't move. If you go now, you'll spoil it. Go on now. Hi, Chama. Where's Imane? She was held up by the cops. I'll tell you something. Is she giving her the papers, or not? The worst thing is my little sister. I convinced her and recruited her. She was so happy to come to me in the caliphate. She was 14 when she got to Turkey. They got her pregnant right away. So she wouldn't leave. A guy watching hotels at the border did it to her. They do anything in the name of Allah. I never saw her again. She killed herself. But... how do I know you've really been there? That you're not making it up? Don't be as stupid as me. I swear, Chama. Where's she going? Where is she? Where is she? She went that way. She's gone! She's gone! Subtitles: Eclair Media
