[waves crashing] [woman] So, my family's lived in Wendover for almost 300 years. The town was settled in 1629 as a fishing village. Clamming and shipbuilding followed. Of course, those industries are long gone. But we still have the beaches and the breezes and the salt air. Wendover has never lost its appeal. Because we've got the best damn views on the North Shore of Boston. It's so beautiful. I feel like I'm cheating... [chuckles] showing you this house with this view on a day like today. I wouldn't change a thing. Except for the price. Wait till you see the root cellar, Robert. It's gonna knock your socks off. "Root cellar"? I've always wanted one of those. You have? The Sandersons are living in a two-bedroom condo in Swampscott. They can't afford this place. I know it, they know it. But I'm giving them an education, and this is how it always begins. With denial. - I don't want to bug her. - Ask her to call back. [woman] I don"t think they'll come down much on the asking price. The good news is it's not the only house for sale in Wendover. So, this is Wendover Crossing, our version of downtown. I love it here. We will find you the right house. Buying a house that's out of reach is a recipe for misery. I should know. I bought a house I could almost afford. And if everything had gone according to plan, I'd be fine. That's not what happened. That's the Dwight house. Just two miles from Hathaway Elementary, which is an excellent public school. It's so adorable. Well, I can't get you in there today, but I think it could be a really good fit. [woman] It wouldn't be the full tour without showing you Wendover Rise. You can see the tidal marshes. Excellent clamming still. What is that house? I sold that a year ago to the McAllisters. Lovely couple from Boston. He runs a hedge fund. Gorgeous property. 20 acres. They did a big renovation and just recently moved in. It looks pricey. - It was. - Mmm. Is that Rebecca? Hi, Rebecca! Hope we didn't startle you. Oh. Rebecca, Lisa and Rob Sanderson. They're thinking of moving from Swampscott. Oh. Well, Wendover is a special place. I ride my horse every day. There are so many beautiful trails. I'm dying to see what you've done with the house. I'll bring a casserole. I would really, really love that. It"s chilly outside, dear. Do me a favor and put on a sweater. - Oh. [chuckles] - And a hat. - Some leggings. [chuckles] - [Rebecca chuckles] Yes. Sometimes I get carried away. I don't really think things through. [laughs] - All right. - Take care, Rebecca. Hello, Kendall. Any calls? No, and I've texted him, like, 20 times. I meant, did I get any calls? I don't think so. It's a yes or no question, dear. No. Okay. Oh, I forgot, um, your daughter called. Which one? Tess or Emily? Um... I'll figure it out. Yikes, Mom, is everything okay with your new assistant? I'm doing her mother a favor. Kendall's on a gap year. She didn't get into any of her top schools, and her boyfriend's at Cornell. Poor thing. Have some sympathy. Oh, please. I worked my way through UMass, and I'm the top broker on the North Shore. Or at least I was until... So, I'm calling because my bummer landlord is raising the rent. Your apartment is criminally overpriced as it is. I know, but it's a good deal for Brooklyn. [sighs] All right. Email me the amount. Just make sure they fix the toilet, okay? You're the best, Mom. I really, really appreciate it. I'm happy I can help, and I'm hoping I won't have to help forever. Me too. But I'm trying to build a career as an artist, and I need to be in New York. Do you think I'm excited to ask you for money? No. I'm sure it's very hard. It is hard. It's embarrassing. But I hope you know, all my roommates get help from their parents too, and we all feel like losers. I mean... Well, chin up, sweetheart, and let's talk soon, okay? Bye. God. [inhales] I need a good year. [phone ringing, beeps] - Tess. - Hi, Mom. How are you? I'm so sorry, but Lottie is sick. We don't need you to babysit tomorrow. Poor baby. What's wrong with her? Hand, foot and mouth. [Lottie] My tongue hurts, Mommy. Well, I'm not afraid of any hand, foot and mouth. It seems pretty miserable. Thank God for Popsicles. Oh. I gotta go, Tess. Let me know if you change your mind, okay? I'm here if you need me. -Thanks, Mom. I'll call you tomorrow. Bye. -Bye. ["Time of the Season" plays on car stereo] Frank, I've been calling you for days. Hey, Hildy. Remember this one? ♪ ...name? Who's your daddy? ♪ Do you ever answer your phone? No. Well, there's a lawyer from Boston who's very interested in your waterfront lot. - What for? - What do you think he wants it for? It's one of the best lots left in Wendover. I could get you a wicked good price for it. [chuckles] "Wicked"? You're talking townie to me. You're a businessman, Frank. Don't you wanna make money? Not as much as you do. Don't you wanna find out what he's willing to pay? You'll lose your access to Getchell Cove. I have plenty of coastline to avail myself of. "Avail." Where you heading in that getup? I'm going to Wendy Heatherton's party, not that it's any of your business. The butcher's daughter's gone fancy-pants. Yeah, and Frankie Getchell still can't carry a tune. Never could, never will. Let me know if you change your mind. I answer my phone. ♪ Hildy answers her phone! ♪ [thinking] I used to love going to parties. But that was before the ambush. So many cars out there, I had to park... [Hildy] I should have turned around and run. Where"s my little Lottie-Lou? - In here, Mom. - I want my Lottie time before Grandma Nancy swoops in. [Hildy] What's going on? - Is Lottie all right? - Yeah, she's fine, Mom. - She's right here. - [Hildy] Oh. [sighs] Is it my birthday? Mom, come sit down. Yes, dear. Let me introduce everyone first. This is my eldest daughter, Tess, and her husband, Michael. This is Lottie, my granddaughter, my imp. - [fusses] - Yes, I know. I babysit her whenever I can. Don't I, sweetheart? This is their lovely house in Beverly, which I happily financed. This is my younger daughter, Emily. She's a little dramatic. Emily drove all the way up from New York City for this. Isn't that thoughtful? This is my ex-husband Scott, to whom I pay alimony, even though he left me for a man after 22 years of marriage. That's Wendy Heatherton. This is 18 months ago when she still worked for me, before raiding my Rolodex and stealing all my clients. And I didn't know who this person was. I'm Joyce, Hildy. Would you like to have a seat? We have people here who love you and have some things they'd like to say to you if you'll listen. I"m gonna go put Lottie to bed. Okay. What a good girl. [sighs] Well, if we're really gonna do this, I need a drink. - Oh, my God. - [Emily] What? - Mom! - You've hit the whole point. - Kidding. - [Scott scoffs] [sighs] It was my graduation. It was my party. And I spent the whole night terrified that you'd drink too much and dance with all of my friends, which is exactly what you did. Well, since when is dancing a crime? If it were, your father and I would have been thrown in jail in college. We drank too much in college. Last Thanksgiving, you passed out in front of Michael's parents. It's called napping. You know I was going, going, going all week. I had to make two dozen little pumpkins stuffed with corn pudding. Then there was the DUI. I tapped the car. I tapped it. There was no damage, no one was hurt. It just happened to be that idiot state trooper. You were drinking and driving. Sweetheart, do you think I was the only one who drove home from Mamie's that night? Are you gonna go off to all their houses after this? Hildy, the first step is admitting you have a problem. I was one of the top 50 business owners in all of Massachusetts. Does that sound like a problem to you? Stop, Mom. Just stop! The clients are asking questions. I'm sorry, Mom, but if you don't get help, Michael and I can't leave you alone with Lottie anymore. [Joyce] I can take you tonight, Hildy. So I let them send me away. All I could think was it was too bad the girls never met my mother, because then they'd know what a real alcoholic looks like. Hildy Good! - Peter. - Hey. - Good to see you. - Good to see you. And, Elise, we haven't seen you in a while. Well, I do what I can to avoid these kinds of things. Love the new glasses. They're not new. Rebecca McAllister, Peter and Elise Newbold. - Peter grew up here, but now they're in Cambridge. - Hi. Yeah, we come up every weekend. Rebecca's from Boston. Via Brazil. I grew up all over the world, actually. I met my husband on a plane. - Here he is. - Hey there, Hildy. - Brian, how are you? - Thirsty as shit. Hildy and I used to babysit Dr. Newbold. Mamie Lang, one of my oldest friends. We haven't been seeing much of each other lately. You should have seen him skipping around in these little short pants. - Good grief! - I was eight. Peter is our resident psychiatrist. Well, I spend most of the week at McLean, and then I practice up here a couple days a week. Wendover keeps him very busy. The worried well. Hildy, Carl and I are so glad you could join us at our little soiree. Uh-oh! Got the two real estate queens here. This town big enough for the both of them? [chuckles] Shall we say, uh, pistols at dawn? I like to sleep in. [all chuckling] Aren't the McAllisters a wonderful addition to Wendover? - Delightful. - Mmm. How are you doing? I think I'm doing just fine. Carl, the servers aren't circulating. Say something. I'm just so proud of you, Hildy. So, so proud. I get a bit too much of that these days. [laughing, chattering] It's true! Brian thinks I can destroy things with my mind. No, it's her body chemistry or static electricity or something, but every time I buy her a watch, the thing stops working. Rolex, Cartier, doesn't matter. Brian thinks I'm a witch. I think maybe your wife just has bad luck with watches. You know who's a witch? - Oh. - I knew I liked you for a reason. Her great-great-great... - Eight generations. - [Rebecca chuckles] My ancestor, Sarah Good, was one of the first accused witches in Salem. Hildy can read minds. Can you please read Brian's mind? I'm sure there's more in there than just numbers. [chuckles] I think she gives me too much credit. Do it, Hildy. All right, but only if you promise not to hang me. [Rebecca, Brian laugh] Brian, give me your hand. Mmm. [exhales] Now... I'm gonna ask you to think about something that happened in your past, a memory. I'll present you with a few questions. Just try not to nod or give anything away with your eyes. Oh, I got a killer poker face. Now just look at me, try not to blink, don't nod, and think about... Oh. It's a happy memory. It's from your childhood. No. - Don't nod. - I didn't nod. - I didn't see him nod. - He nodded with his eyes. It wasn't a regular day. It was a special day. It was Christmas. No, it wasn't Christmas. It was... It was your birthday. You're good. Stop helping me. It was when you were still a child. You were nine? No. I believe you were ten. It was something you were given, a gift. Try to remember where you were when you first saw it. You weren't in the house. You were outside. You were led outside and you saw the yellow bicycle your parents gave you for your tenth birthday. Holy crap. It happens every time. It gives me chills. That is... That is freaky. That's not even a major memory for me. [Peter] She told you to think of it. Didn't you, Hildy? Brilliantly, by the way. Do you mind if I try to deconstruct what you just did? [Hildy] Be my guest. Okay, so, first thing I noticed was some suggestive things. You said, um, "I'm going to present you with some questions." Present. Uh, and then you said several times, "Don't give anything away." "Give me your hand." So, you suggested that he recall a memory of a present or a gift. I must be very clever. And then it was a classic cold reading from there. There's more to it. I've seen it too many times. Well, cheers to you, Hildy Good. To the witches of Wendover. To Hildy! ["Season of the Witch" by Donovan begins] - [dogs barking] - Hello, girls. Hello, my beautiful bitches. How are you?

No, no, no! - Patch! - No, no, no! - Jake, honey. - Jake. - [Patch] Jake, Jake. Jake. - He's having a total meltdown. - No! No! No! - No, Jake, Jake, Jake. Stop. - [woman shushes] - [Patch] It's okay. [Patch] It's okay. Okay? Wanna go watch a show? [Patch] Yeah? I saw this and thought of Jake. - Hey, Hildy. - Hey, Patch. Hey, Cassie. Thank you. [chuckles] God. [sighs] [chuckles] We, uh... We had to move the locks up last week because Jake got out. Took us two hours to find him. Turns out he was in Bob Crandall's yard just staring at a backhoe. - I have good news. - Yeah? I have some potential buyers. The fixer-upper angle isn't working. House has great curb appeal, but inside we need some TLC. Well, I'd love to, but Patch is already working three jobs. - He doesn't have the time. - That's why I wanna call Frank Getchell. Getchell? We can't afford one of Frank's crews. I would pay Frankie myself. No, Hildy, I'm not taking your money. Cassie, I need to sell this house as much as you do. You can pay me back when we close. Now, what do you think is under that carpet? Disgusting stains. I don't know, Hildy. [chuckles] - [Hildy] Huh. - [Cassie sighs] [announcer] Oh and two the count. Swing and a miss. Lambert notches another K. A good slider, and it's one away. - The Sox's season is... - Hey, Hildy. What happened, did you take the wrong driveway? I would've called, but we've established you don't answer your phone. Recovered from last night? Last night... [laughing] Whoo-hoo! Pretty cold for a midnight dip. Good night, Hil. Oh, Frank. You scared the shit out of me. What are you doing here? [chuckles] Fishing. Or trying to. You were spying on me. I came here for peace and quiet. - Uh-huh. - Yeah. Instead, I got an eyeful. Bring back any happy memories? - You look good, Hil. - Oh, Frankie. Thanks for the show. Whoo! [baseball game broadcast continues] Water's warmest this time of year, Frank. You know that. - Water was 58 last night. - Listen, I need work done at the Dwights'. Drywall needs patching, whole place needs paint, pull up the old carpet. I got all my guys on a job over in Manchester this week. All your guys? Yep. Big job. Some hotshot biotech guy decided he wanted to move his swimming pool. The Dwights are moving to Newton. They found a good school there for Jake, but they have to sell their house first. Sorry. Bad timing. Forget I asked. I'll see who else I can get. Hildy. I'll drive over there later, see what they need. I can probably spare one or two guys. Well, that would be wonderful. Patch and Cassie can really use the help. Biotech guy's a real jackass. Swimming pool looked fine where it was. [breathes deep] Must be nice to be that rich. Look like you're doing all right, Hildy. So, I'll see you on the beach? I'll be the guy in the parka. - Come on. Those are my clients. - [door closes] -[man] Hey, Kendall. Is Hildy around? -[Kendall] I don't, uh... Uh, Peter Newbold is here to see you. Do you want me to get rid of him? Uh, no, Kendall. Thank you. Peter, come in. Is now a bad time? Not at all. What can I do for you? Well... [sighs] ...you might need a new tenant upstairs. I'm up for a big job in San Francisco. - Long way from Wendover. - [Peter sighs] Could be nice to practice medicine somewhere where no one's ever seen me in lederhosen. [chuckles] Your legs were like two little toothpicks. Um, does that mean you and Elise would be selling the house? Um, yeah, if I got the position. Yeah. Well, I'm happy to take a look. Give you an idea of what it's worth. I remember your father sitting right up here. His perch. He could be pretty intimidating. Hmm. - Yeah, his patients loved him. - Mmm. I can walk through a house once and know more about its occupants than a psychiatrist like Peter could in a year of sessions. I like a house that looks lived in. General wear and tear is a healthy sign. A house that's too clean speaks as much to me of domestic discord as a house in complete disarray. Alcoholics, hoarders, binge eaters, depressives. You name it. I could see it all in the worn edges of their nests. I'll run some comps. Okay. Just so you know, I'm not really talking about this to anyone. I won't tell a soul. Not even the ghosts. Thanks, Hildy. It's one of the sad truths about being a Realtor. Divorce is good for business. [Lottie chattering] Look at this, though. I'm gonna put all kinds of strange things in the cup. - There you go. - I wish your mom had been around to play with us when we were little. My mom didn't do this stuff. Well, she was obviously clinically depressed. No one ever used those words when we were growing up. Come on, Mom. Why do you refuse to talk about it? - I'm talking about it. - [scoffs] You know, it's just what it was. If Mom was in a mood, we went outside. That's what kids did back then. Right. The good old days. - Well, I turned out fine. - [blows raspberry] Hey. So, uh, what's she doing here and not at the Anhawan Beach Club, huh? [chuckles] [Hildy] Oh. I"m sure she wants to meet some people. Well, she didn't come say hello. The dinosaurs can. [Hildy] Rebecca. Hi. Have you met Cassie Dwight? No. Hey. I'm, uh, Patch Dwight's wife. He did all the plumbing for your reno. -Oh, yeah. Patch did a great job for us. -[Cassie chuckles] And who's this handsome boy? - Uh, this is my son Jake. - Hi. We're here almost every afternoon if it's not raining. - You should join us. - Oh, we would love that. Thank you so much. [chuckles] - Jake. Jake, honey. Jake. - [Jake] My truck! Mine! -My truck! -I'm sorry. He loves trucks. It's okay. Why don't we just take turns? - No, Rebecca, don't touch... - No, no, no... It's okay, sweetie. It's okay. ♪ The wheels on the truck Go round and round ♪ Jake is autistic. -I didn't know. He doesn't look... -Doesn't look what? - Cassie, Rebecca's meeting Jake for the very first time. - Doesn't look what? - ♪ Round and round... ♪ - Mom, that's my truck. I know, baby. - Mom, I want my truck. - [speaks Portuguese] Rebecca, I'm so sorry. It's not your fault, Hildy. It's not your fault. Cassie's under a lot of pressure. I'm happy to come back here with you any day. That was awful. [engine starts] [sighs] - [Frank] Hey! - [Hildy] Hey, yourself. Oh, sorry, Hildy. [grunts] It's coming along. What do you think? I think we should've talked budget. The sink was free. Had a little scratch in it, so the builders didn't want it. It's gonna fit perfectly, and Patch can do all the plumbing. Fixtures will be here tomorrow. It's gonna be good. And the fridge? The dishwasher? I've always got stuff lying around. I thought you had all your guys on another job. I figured it out. No big deal. Guess I asked the right guy, huh? Wait till you see the bill. [chuckles] Thank you, Frank. Yeah. [Hildy] There was a time in my life I was quite in love with Frankie Getchell. You would've been too, if you could've seen him. All my friends were. It was the summer before college. He taught me to sail. [chuckles] He rebuilt this whole boat by himself. Named it after my notorious ancestor. Which, for him, was pretty romantic. Frankie was my first. I cried all the way to UMass that fall. [chuckles] Frank went into the army, and I met Scott. He was oh-so dapper. Introduced me to the world of high-thread-count linens and good wine. I do miss sailing. [people chattering] Seriously? A cup of coffee is 4.50? You know what? I'm good. What a racket. Hildy. How are ya? I'm experiencing a little bit of sticker shock over what they're charging for a cup of coffee. Wicked good coffee though. Fair trade. Organic microlots. You can really taste the vanilla notes. Where'd you get four dollars for coffee, Henry? [chuckles] I drink it real slow. Okay, Henry. Have a good one. You too, Hildy. Take it easy. Maybe I'll see you at a meeting sometime. -You know me, Henry. Never been much of a joiner. -Hmm. We got here early. Did a little window-shopping. Yeah, this place is great. Does a top-notch chai latte. Great foam art. - I got the cutest owl. - And I got a panda. Have you read about the panda that was born in the Providence zoo? Terrific addition to our town, right? Shall we head over to the Dwight house? Don't work too hard, Hildy. I won't, Henry. And I know you won't either.

I'm better now. I started seeing Peter Newbold. Oh. Peter's a good man. I'm sure he's a very good psychiatrist. It was always my secret plan to convert the boathouse into a studio. Huh. Have you always painted? I went to the Royal College of Art. Picture me with purple hair, bangs covering my face, - smoking a cigarette, brooding. - [chuckles] Got a bottle of red open, but I'm happy to open some white if you prefer. Uh, I'm getting over a cold. They're beautiful. I'm so glad. - I was afraid you might be another rich lady with a hobby. - [laughs] You're honest. I paint from photographs. I know that... I know that spot. That's the... the Newbold dock. Yes. I've always liked you, Hildy. - I'm so glad you came over. - Me too. I was really looking forward to moving to Wendover, then I just plummeted. I felt so lonely. I just couldn't find my footing. Coming into a small town can be hard and I'm sure the incident with Cassie didn't help anything. Well, it got me to get some help, so here I am. - Here you are. - [Rebecca chuckles] Mmm. Hildy Good looking good! Henry Barlow, always in the same chair. [chuckles] So, you come around on the coffee? - I'm meeting clients. - Oh. I don't know how I ever sold a house in this town - before overpriced soy lattes. - Yeah. [chuckles] Did you see the house the Santorelli brothers are building out on Gray's Point? It's a real showplace. - Is it close to being done? - Oh, it's very close. This is why you should come to meetings. [Henry] People really spill the beans. Hildy! I heard you sold the Dwight place. Yes, I did. Good for you. That was a tricky sale. Excuse me, I'm meeting clients from California. [chuckles] Isn't that fun? Hey, uh, uh, uh. Hey, careful there, Hildy. You'll never get away with it. Too many witnesses. But you'll help me dispose of the body, won't you, Henry? Oh, right on, you know it. Us OG Wendovers, we gotta stick together. - [car approaching] - [dog barking] Brian and I had a huge fight. I didn't know where else to go. I'm glad you came here. [sniffles] Oh. Your house is so cozy. [chuckles] Well, my ex-husband, Scott, chose nearly everything you see. He left me for a man. That must have been devastating. I'm surprised you didn't know, actually. Secrets are hard to keep in this town, although we do all try our damnedest. [sniffles] Maybe you also haven't heard that I went to rehab a little bit ago for drinking. - A gay husband will do that to you. - [laughing] [laughing] I can't tell you how many of my friends have been to rehab. They're all fine, meaning they all drink. Cheers to that. They never tell you that in rehab. Mm-mmm. [chuckles] [sighs] So, tell me. What's going on? Oh, well, Brian just announces tonight we're going to Zurich for Christmas. Doesn't even ask me. Zurich? Poor baby. Okay, I know how that must sound, but I moved around a lot when I was a kid. I just wanted to spend Christmas at home, not some soulless resort, wondering which of the many women I can see out of the corner of my eye is my husband's mistress. That's happening? I made it so easy for him. I'm up here, he's in Boston all week. What was I thinking? - He's an idiot. - Mm. Mm-hmm. [sniffles] I feel like I should clear something up. Um... I may have led you to believe that Peter was my psychiatrist, but I've only consulted with him once or twice. He's not my doctor. Rebecca, I know you and Peter are involved. Okay. [laughs] - [chuckles] - Okay. [laughs] Uh... What else do you know? You went to see him. It was more than just a session or two. You started thinking Peter was attractive during those sessions. He's so smart. And he makes me laugh. Then you started running into him all over town. The gas station, the beach. You'd think of him and he'd be there. It felt like fate. Yes. Peter started telling you about his life. His marriage had been dead for years. He wants to escape this tiny corner of the world. He feels trapped here. Stifled. How do you know all this? Well... it's true of most men in midlife, Rebecca. And most women too. Truth is we're all pretty much the same. Be careful. I need a drink. [sighs] [chuckles] - Do you want some apple? - No. Okay. [sighs] I have to stop making snacks for Lottie and face the fact that I'm just making snacks for myself. How does Grandma Nancy have time to put together these inane scrapbooks? Be nice, Mom. She really cares about them. She insisted I get that to you ASAP. She picks the worst pictures of me. [Hildy] God. So, I'm back in therapy. You are? What for? Anxiety. Feel like I'm not doing a good job at work, like I'm not doing a good job with... I'm kind of a mess. [scoffs] Welcome to motherhood. Have you tried a martini? Very funny. Good news. I can help pay, uh, for Lottie's preschool tuition after all. I thought business was slow. I turned it around like I always do. Mom, you don't have to help us. I want to. I know you're hug-averse, but... Oh, I love that you're doing so well. Come for dinner tonight. Michael's making lemon chicken. Oh, that's so nice, dear. Another time. I have plans. Ah. My daughters would freak if they could see me right now. Oh. Don't they want you to be happy? No, - they want me to be easy. - [chuckles] [Hildy chuckles] You know, I can't tell you how nice these last weeks have been. [sighs] I just feel like I'm part of the world again. - Cheers to that. - [Hildy chuckles] Cheers! [chuckles] Peter showed me this amazing photo of you. You were in cutoffs and a yellow bikini top leaping off the ferry dock. Oh. Well, Peter was always running around with his little camera. - Mmm. - He was like the town photojournalist. - He was good at it too. - Hmm. Well, his father put an end to that. Doctor Newbold. He sounds like he was pretty severe. The town loved him, but he was hard on Peter. And I... I felt for the little Peanut. I still do. Please don't call him Peanut. No? [laughs] No? What? It's not sexy? No, it's not sexy at all. I don't call him Peanut to his face. I call him Dr. Peanut. [both laughing] In rehab, a lot of people talked about having a drink to brace themselves for an occasion. I'm not like that. I like a drink, I don't need a drink. Still, Thanksgiving is a lot to ask of a sober person. [man] Is the turkey dry? I don't like dry. Hildy, what would you like to drink with dinner? I'll have a Bloody Mary. Hold the vodka. You're wicked, Hildy. - Wicked pissah. - [chuckles] It's either that or a juice box, right? Don"t skimp on the Tabasco. Happy Thanksgiving, darling. [sighs] Happy Thanksgiving. [Scott] I haven't been there for a while. Tess, have you shown your mother my latest Lottie scrapbook? There are some terrific photos of you in it, Hildy. Can't wait to see it. Oh, gosh, I forgot to put the pies in the oven. - I'll do it. - Get a spoon in this. All right. Let's eat, please. Everyone altogether. [Tess] Perhaps wait till Mom's back. [Nancy] This looks fantastic. [Scott] God, this is great! [Bill] Gravy's good. I haven't had anything but wine since I started drinking again. In my mind, somehow, wine is not really drinking. Vodka definitely is. [Bill] Very good. Nancy, I'm gonna go pull those pies out of the oven for you. Still can't believe you gave her a carrot. She'll eat vegetables if I give them to her. [chattering] Nancy, the pies look incredible. Such beautiful latticework. I mean, you're a real artist. Mom, your cranberry sauce is the best. I always double the orange zest. [Scott] I can't get full of it. I look forward to this every year. Mmm. - [Bill] Fantastic. - [Tess] I'm so full. I think she's got a natural gift for music. I do. Doesn't take after our side of the family. She gets it from you and Mom. They used to sing. [Bill] It's a very difficult profession. Musicians die younger, on average, than the general population. [Nancy chuckles] Thanks, Dad. [all chuckling] It's just something we used to do for fun in college. Well, no, we made some money. We played in coffeehouses. People knew who we were in... In Northampton. In Northampton. Me want Grammy and Grandpa to sing, right? [chuckles] - Yes! Michael, go get my guitar. - No. All right. Lightfoot?

A real hug! -[chuckles] I'll be back home in a couple of weeks. - I can't wait. - It's so late, Mom. - Why don't you just spend the night? - Oh, I wish I could, dear. But I have the dogs, I have clients in the morning. Oh. You have to work the day after Thanksgiving? My mortgage doesn't pay itself, Nancy. [Nancy] Oh.

But I never told anyone anywhere about my Frankie Getchell jackpot. [Hildy] It was nine years ago, right before Scott left me. Frankie. I thought it would be one of your guys. No, me. I just have a flat. Yeah, I'm gonna take care of it, but I wanna get you home first. - Okay? - Wait! Wait, wait. I have to ask you a very serious question. What? Why do you wear that little tablecloth on top of your head? - [chuckles] - [Hildy laughs] Gee, Hil. Why don't you tell me what you're really thinking? I just did. I hate your bandanna. - Well, ju... - You have such pretty hair. Where's Scott at? Mmm. He's, uh... Uh, he's in Upstate New York. He's, um, antiquing. It's just me. I'm all alone. Uh, okay. But... I'm alone even when he's home. [chuckles] What does that mean? He doesn't even look at me. He doesn't even come near me. You serious? Yes. - This... No. - Oh... Let's not go there, okay? - Hildy, no. - What, what, what? No, no, no. No. You think I'm unattractive. I think you're married, and hammered. You sleep it off. You're gonna feel different in the morning. You used to be fun. [engine starts] [exhales sharply] Where are blackouts when you need them? Anyway, I'm not about to start having jackpots now.

I've been looking for you. Are you okay? Uh, I'm fine, Rebecca. How are you? How was your Thanksgiving? Wait, what? Hildy, I've been trying to reach you. Last night really scared me. You don't remember. Of course I remember. You came to the house at 2:00 in the morning. You woke Ben up. You tried to convince me to egg Wendy Heatherton's house. Brian was gonna drive you home, but you just took off. You're sweet to check on me. I'm sorry if I disturbed Ben. Are you really gonna lose your house? If you need to, Brian might be able to loan you some money. I have clients coming from Connecticut any moment, so I have to go prepare for them. You really shouldn't be driving around like that. I certainly don't make a habit of it. [laughs] I hope you haven't told anybody about me and Peter. Jesus. What's going on between you and Peter is none of my business. Because he could lose his license, which is ridiculous because I barely even saw him professionally. I have told no one. That you remember. You know, Rebecca, I don't have a rich husband. I have to work for a living. And I wouldn't be this successful if I was in the habit of running around town blabbing about matters that don't concern me. Now, if you don't mind, I'm gonna get ready for my fucking clients! [sighs] Obviously Rebecca is a tad unstable. Should probably keep my distance. [sniffles] Maybe I did have a little too much last night. [sighs] Needless to say, it won't happen again. [Patch] You don't think the Sandersons could push? I know they can't. They have to be out of their condo February 1. [Cassie] Right, it's just... that school in Newton said they were holding a spot for Jake, and now they can't take him until fall. [Patch] We were just wondering, what would happen if we back out? We'll lose the Sandersons. [Cassie] I know this sucks, Hildy. We're sorry. You've done so much to help us out. We'll sell in the summer. We all want what's best for Jake. - Right? - [phone beeps] Hildy, Andy over at North Shore Range Rover. And this is awkward, but your assistant still hasn't dealt with your payment situation, - but apropos of our discussion... - [phone beeps] Hey, lady, wake up! Hey! You gotta... You gotta be careful, Hildy. You're gonna end up roadkill. I hope you can wait a little longer for me to pay you. The Dwights just backed out of the sale. Ah... [mumbles] Oh, I thought of you. I was out fishing with Manny Briggs the other day, and I saw that spread the Santorellis are putting up. Is it huge? Is it ugly? They got a chain over the drive. I can't get in to see it. It's mighty. Takes up the whole point. You think Manny would take me out to get a look sometime? Why don't you come out with us some morning? You're gonna have to haul traps though. [horn honks] Go around me, you asshole! [laughing] People. I'd like that, Frankie. Where's your hat? It's freezing out there. I look terrible in hats. I like that you didn't clean up for me. - I did. - [chuckles] Really? Hey, Manny. Hiya, Hildy. [Hildy] Hi, Bill. She baked, uh, muffins. They got bran in them? I'm pretty clogged up.

Gotta get this listing ahead of Wendy Heatherton. [shutter clicking] Um... Uh, Frank. You wanna come over for dinner? Help me eat these? - Dinner? - Yeah. It's this meal people eat at the end of the day. It's pretty popular. [chuckles] Sure. - Yeah? - Yeah. Dinner. What? I know it looks bad, but really, it's fine. We're supposed to have our first freeze tonight, and I don't want all these bottles exploding and making a mess. I mean, come on. I'm just gonna tuck them away in the cellar. I'm not gonna sneak them under my bed or anything. It's a really... - I got this recipe... - great kitchen. I got this recipe out of the Globe. You got a good... It's a great kitchen. You really lucked out with this house, Hildy. "Lucked out"? [scoffs] Didn't exactly win it in the lottery. You've done real good for yourself. That's what I meant to say. You haven't done so badly yourself, Frankie. You should let me sell that lot next door for you. You really want some Boston lawyer to build some McMonster there that you have to look at every day? I don't think so. Why are you so protective of my view? I've seen you make some pretty big mistakes. You have? Name one. Taking Wendy Heatherton under your wing. Agreed. Driving that stupid car. Well, I needed to project success. Marrying a gay guy. Okay. Clearly you're on top of my many mistakes. Whoa. Should I get another bottle? I don't know. Should you?

No, no, no. - Are you with somebody? - Emily. - [grunting] As a matter of fact, I am. Did you forget I was coming home tonight? Can I help you? Are there any toothbrushes? I left my toothbrush in New York. - Oh, God. - Uh... Have you tried under the sink in the guest bath? I did. Those are all medium. I like soft. Just use a medium and brush soft! - Oh. Uh, I guess I could floss. - There you go. And maybe rinse my mouth out with... - Good night, Emily. - Oh. Okay, bye. [Emily] Is this a new rug? [grunting] - Frank. - Yeah? Did we... Did we leave a bottle downstairs? Uh... Probably, yeah. - Oh, my God. - What? - I'm supposed to be in recovery. - [grunts] My daughters think I go to AA. Oh, come on. They're gonna send me back there again. Hildy. You're the mom. You can do whatever you want. - Frank. - Yeah? - Frank, I... - [moans] What? Will you please, please, please go? Hmm? I'm sorry. I just have to... Yeah. No. Sure. Yeah. - It's just that... - Okay. No, no. I understand. I understand. [grunts, pants] Oh, God. The snow already started. I gotta get my guys out with their plows anyways. [groans] [breathes heavily] So, I'll, uh... I'll see you around, Hil. - Take this bottle. - Yeah. And then, uh, take the one downstairs... Take it out. Yeah. Wow, it's coming down. I gotta go. Is there anything else? Yeah, I've got everything. Okay. Oh. Pants on. In case I run into your daughter. Don't want her coming after me like your old man did. Remember? Frankie. Give me a kiss before you go. Okay, sure. Okay. Thanks for the lobsters. They were perfectly cooked. [door opens, closes] [coffee grinder whirring] Morning, Emily. Can you turn the heat up? It's freezing in here. It's winter, kiddo. Put on a sweater and some socks. I told you I'd be home on the 17th. Well, it's been very busy at work. Was that Frank Getchell's truck in the driveway last night? It was, yes. Were you in bed with Frank Getchell? What if I was? Are you dating Frank Getchell? Maybe. [chuckles] He's the garbageman. He owns a maintenance company that happens to handle garbage removal. One of his many lucrative businesses. He happens to be one of the wealthiest people in town, Emily. He wears a do-rag. Well, that was a bad look. And he got rid of that years ago. Were you drinking last night? I found a bottle of wine in the trash. And it smelled like somebody was smoking weed. Frank drinks. And he smokes. All of my friends drink. As do my daughters. But you weren't? No, Emily. Of course not. The relief on Emily's face, you'd think she and Tess had spent their entire childhoods carrying me out of bars. Now, look, I know it must seem awful to blatantly lie to one's own daughter, but it's for Emily's own good. Her peace of mind. Does he smell like garbage? He smells like a man. Ew! [chuckles] Kendall, have you seen my tape measure? I thought I left... I can't talk right now. Who else was there? Okay. I can't believe she said that. Hildy, what happened to the Range Rover? Is it in the shop? No, Wendy. This is my new car. I can't believe that you can fold yourself into that thing with those amazing, long legs of yours. I'm a grandmother now. I wanted to do something for the planet. My clients seem to really appreciate the gesture. Of course. We all need to do our part. We do. You know Lisa and Robert. Hi. Good to see you, Hildy. Hey, Hildy. You left me a message? Oh. Uh, yes, Peter. Uh, come in. Um... So, I was just wondering what was happening with the house. Um... No decisions yet. Elise and Sam coming up for the weekend? No, Elise has a faculty thing, and Sam's got a soccer tournament. Oh. You're on your own quite a bit these days. Yeah. Uh, well... I'm working on my book. How"s Rebecca? I haven't seen her for a while. Hildy, this isn't my place, but Rebecca mentioned that you'd been drinking again. Is everything okay? I drink with my friends from time to time. It's a social thing. No big deal. Well, we all self-medicate in our own ways. I know you were very young when your mother committed suicide. And they didn't have anything like grief counseling back then. So some of your... I don't think anybody... in all the many years since my mother's death had ever actually stated the fact of it so plainly to me. [inhales sharply] People talked about my mother's "tragic passing" and her "untimely death", but never ever did anyone say the word "suicide." [Hildy] She drank, of course. But everyone did back then. Nobody was an "alcoholic." Ma, is it okay if I have supper at Mamie's? Ma? Emily? Em? Hey, pups. Hey, girls. How are you? Yes. Who wants to come down to the cellar with me and get a little bottle of merlot? That yummy merlot. Huh? I don't blame you. It's pretty creepy. I'm just gonna get a little something. Take the edge off. [door closes] [Emily] Mom? Hello? I'm here with Hailey. Hi, Ms. Good. Mom? Maybe she's at her boyfriend's. Do you think they have sex? Aren't they too old? No, because I heard them. - [Hailey gags, laughs] - [Emily laughs] - [loud dance music plays] - [young women laughing, chattering] [laughing] [inhales, sighs] Oh. [laughing] [laughing, chattering continue] [dog tags jingling] [whining, licking] You can do this. You can stop. You can stop right now. You don't need it. [sobs] You don't need it. You just... You just have to stop now. - [phone beeps] - [line rings] [Frank] Hey, Hil. You answered your phone. Well, it's you. [Hildy] May Santa come early. - [Scott] And often. - [chuckling] Merry Christmas, everyone. - [Scott] Merry Christmas. - [Tess] Merry Christmas. - Emily. - Merry Christmas. [Scott] Darling. Merry Christmas. Mmm. You don't wanna have the whole ocean in front of you, because the ocean in front of you can be very threatening. [chuckling] Okay. [whimpering] [Frank] These sheets are great. My girls really like you. Well, they're good girls. Which one is older? Is it Tess or... I was talking about my dogs. - Oh. - Bottom line is, none of the four has bitten you, and that's a good sign. Of what? You know, that I'm happy. - Hmm. - I feel like myself with you. Usually I only feel like myself when I have a drink in my hand. I like when you're not drinking, because then I know that you're... you know, where you wanna be, and you're with who you wanna be with. And I'm not just some... Piece of meat? Yeah. Some... tough old pot roast. Tough old pot roast. - [phone ringing] - [Frank] It's a little late. Who could that be? [ringing] Rebecca. - Rebecca? - I know it's late, and we haven't been talking, but I'm really freaking out. What's going on? Peter and I were supposed to spend Valentine's Day together, but now I can't reach him. He's not answering his phone, and I have a terrible feeling - that something bad is gonna happen. - Hang up. It's late. It's late, Rebecca. Let's talk tomorrow. He wants to change his life, but he's panicking. He thinks he'll lose everything. Will you please call him? No, I won't call him. I can't get involved in this. Peter warned me not to trust you. He said you were a manipulative old drunk feeding on gossip, but I know you care about him. Go to bed, you fruitcake. Is that what people think of me? Oh, Hildy. I don't give a care what people think. Neither should you. I do. I care what people think. [sighs] Women who don't care what people think end up hanged in the public square. Oh. Not anymore. Cash offer, at asking... You're shitting me. Closing to be mutually determined. Jake can finish out the school year. We haven't told him yet. It sounds fishy. Would you sit down? You're being rude. I called the bank. It all checks out. But who are these people? We haven't had a showing in weeks. It's this couple from New York. They saw the pictures on my website and fell in love. [all chuckling] Sign the papers. [laughs] Henry! Let me buy you a hundred-dollar cup of coffee. You're in a good mood. Well, springtime, business is picking up. Not to mention what's picking up between you and Frankie Garbage. Henry, you would have made a great Realtor. [laughing] Yeah. What did they ask for the Newbold place? I thought they'd never sell. - They're not selling. - Oh, yeah? Linda Barlow is up there now going through the attic, packing and pitching stuff. I figured you'd be the agent on that one. You used to babysit Peter Peanut. See, now? This is why you need to come to meetings. [sighs] Hey, Hildy. I heard you and Elise are selling the house. Yeah. I was just coming to talk to you about that. You gave the listing to Wendy Heatherton. [sighs] It's not personal. It's extremely personal. I'm a manipulative old drunk who feeds on gossip? I was feeling backed into a corner when I said that. You got the job in San Francisco. Rebecca wants to go with you. Look, Brian McAllister knows that Rebecca was my patient. The second he finds out about us, he'll destroy me and my career. We can't be together, but I don't know how to tell her. Peter, I'm not interested in telling your secrets or ruining your career, but you have to list your house with me. You're threatening me? I'm the local Realtor. I've known you your whole life. If you don't stick with me, nobody will. You're gonna call Wendy Heatherton and tell her you are listing your house with me. [screaming] What is it? - I got into Dartmouth! - You did? - Can I go meet my mom for lunch? - Yes, absolutely. Oh! Mmm! Thank you! [sighs] - Whoo-hoo! - Oh! [chuckles] Hi. Okay. I've never seen her happy before. She just got into an Ivy, so, you know, she thinks the rest of her life's gonna be a cakewalk. [chuckles] Hildy, I wanted to apologize for dragging you into my drama. You were my only friend in Wendover. This is for you. My house. [chuckles] I finally convinced Peter that we have to tell Brian and Elise. No more sneaking around. And I really wanna introduce Peter to Ben. Not my business. We're moving to San Francisco. Starting over. You think Brian is gonna let you take Ben to San Francisco? Well, I think there are definitely gonna be some fireworks, but I think, in the end, Brian will do what's best for Ben. I wish you both well, Rebecca. I really do. I wish everybody well. [chuckles] Oh. [door opens, closes] It was on the strength of the Newbold listing, and my snazzy presentation, that I landed the Santorelli brothers and their premium property. I gave it a name: "Clementine's Cove." [chuckles] Oh, yeah. Hildy. To Clementine's Cove. Uh, you know, I can't. I'm being good. Oh, come on, Hildy. You can't leave us hanging here. Yeah, deal's not closed till we toast. Okay, if you insist. Just a sip. All right. Chindon. Clementine's Cove. Clementine's Cove. [laughing] Oh, my God. Mamie? - Mamie Lang! - Oh, my God. Mamie Lang! - Hildy Good! - Oh. - [chuckling] - [Mamie] Oh! Looks like you're having fun. You guys know Mamie Lang? - Uh, no. - Mamie Lang! Get in here, Mamie. - We're celebrating. - [Mamie] I love a party. What are we celebrating? - A new partnership. - Hildy is good. - [Hildy] Whoo! - [Mamie] Cheers! [chuckles] - Mamie. - Yes? I got my mojo back. You have the best mojo. [chuckling] - [Mamie] Mmm. - Oh, God. - Oh, boy, I've missed you. - Oh. I've missed me too. [brother 1] The king of the cove, the Santorelli brothers... [laughing, chattering] [brother 1] Killing it, Hildy! - [brother 2] Thirteen mill. - [brother 1] Whoa! Where you going? That's it? I'm going... somewhere. We'll wait. Sorry. Hildy, I'm so glad I ran into you. What you said about the environment really stuck with me. I bought Carl an electric bicycle, and I bought myself a Tesla. Good for you, Wendy. Good for you. And I got the Santorellis. Make sure you bring over some of those clients you stole from me, okay? Don't forget to wear a helmet, Carl. [sighs] [horn honking] [tires screech] [knocking] - What the... - Hiya, Frankie. Hey, Hildy. What's going on? Oh, I'm just having a hard time dealing with my fabulousness, that's all. Been doing a little drinking, huh? [laughs] A little. Uh-huh. Thought you gave that up. No. What idiot let you drive here like this, hmm? This one. [chuckles] Can I have your keys? Are you gonna invite me in or what? Uh... - I'm a little tired. - Yes! - Nah, come on, Let me get you home. - No, no, no. Come on. Come on. No, I'll... I'll drive you home. Go to bed. You need to go to bed. Don't judge me. Give me my keys. I'll drive you. I will walk, thank you. Go to bed. That's why I came here. I thought you'd wanna sleep with the top broker on the North Shore. Go to bed, Hildy. Don't tell me what to do, garbageman. [keys jangling] [door opens] [Frank] Hildy. Hildy! Oh. - Wake up. Wake up, Hil. - No. No, no, no, no! - What did you do? - Frank, what's wrong? - Come here. - [groans] Can't believe I let you walk away. Come here. - I don't know... - Come. - Why are you so angry? - Come here. Come here! - I wanna show you something. - What? Come here. - [gasps] - Do you remember how that happened? No, I... I gave you my keys. Yeah. And then you snuck back and got your spare keys - and you went out again... - No, no... and you hit something or someone. I don't remember. Hildy, Jake Dwight is missing. He's missing. Half the town's out looking for him. - What? - And that's what your car looks like. No, I would remember that. No, you don't remember shit. You were wasted. I... I... I... I will call the police. - No, no, no. No. - I took... What are you gonna say? Huh? Where are you going? I'm gonna pull your car around the back. Then I'm gonna go out and I'm gonna look for that kid. Don't do anything. Don't drink anything! Shit! [sobbing] No. [whimpers, sobs] I'm just gonna have one glass to calm my nerves. Don't you judge me too. Oh! [sobs] We need to talk. Peter. [chuckles] Is it raining? [sniffs] Suicide runs in families, Hildy. Have you considered suicide? No. I never wanted to die. I... My problem is I always wanted to live. I thought we hid it from Brian, but he found out. Didn't take it well. Oh, I didn't say anything. You don't know that, do you? You don't know what you've done. [Peter] Hildy. - [footsteps approaching] - [stairs creaking] [Peter] Hildy. Oh, Peter, I've done a terrible thing. Don't worry. Jake Dwight is okay. - He is? - Yes, he's okay. He'll be home soon. Oh, thank God. [Hildy breathes heavily] It would be highly irregular for a doctor to suggest that you take a drink right now, but what the hell? I'm not gonna be a doctor much longer. What about San Francisco? That's not gonna work out. Oh, well. - Onward. - [Peter chuckles] Don't you get tired, Hildy? Maintaining that Yankee stiff upper lip? It takes a toll. - It's worked for me my whole life. - [chuckles] Just stuff it all down and pour some alcohol over it? Oh, dear. Is Dr. Newbold here to analyze me? No. I'm here to tell you that it's okay to be angry and lonely and scared and sad. I'm here to tell you that it's okay to ask for help. I don't need help. Hildy, you didn't kill anyone. But next time, you might not be so lucky. I just... I just don't think... whining to other people is... [sniffs] [Tess] Mom? Mom! I've been calling and calling. Are you okay? I'm driving into town. I wanna help find Jake Dwight. Oh, they found him, dear. He's fine. What? No, Mom. It's all over the news. I passed search parties on the way here. [chattering] Be careful not to approach him. [Wendy] Don't touch him. Instructions on how to approach Jake if you find him. He loves balloons. - Thanks. - Of course. We're gonna find him. Hildy, I... I told him we were moving. Hildy, Patch said that I shouldn't have, but I did and I'm so stupid. No, no. He's okay. You don't know that. [sniffs] [sobbing] - [Patch] We will find him. - Oh, God. [crying] I don't know why Peter would tell me that he was okay if he wasn't. I don't know, Mom. [man on bullhorn speaks indistinctly] What makes you think he might be here? This is where Cassie used to bring him when he was little to look for mushrooms. And sometimes I'd go with them. You did? That's weird. Why is that weird? Cassie needed the help. I just don't think of you as maternal like that. Kind of you to say. [scoffs] I mean... you were always so into your work, and then after work, you'd be out drinking. I supported this family for decades, I put two girls through college, I continue to pay rents, mortgages, tuitions. All anyone can remember is my drinking! Because it was really bad and you don't wanna deal with that. And depression runs in our family, and I would like to be able to talk to my mother about it. I'm tired of sweeping everything under the rug. I didn't realize I was doing that. [Klaxon blaring] No. [boat horn blows] [gasps] Oh, God. They've found something. - [Tess breathes heavily] - [sirens blare] Oh, poor Cassie. [sobs] -[man on loudspeaker] Bring it around the port side. -[crying] No. There you go. Hold it there. [crying] [man 2 on radio] Shore 6, Shore 4. [man 3 on radio] Shore 4, go. [man on radio] Uh, Shore 1 is transporting DB at this time. Shore 2 will notify local PD, Sergeant Wynnan. [police, onlookers chattering] They found him? Not Jake. It's Peter Newbold. Peter? No. [stammers] That can't be. I just saw him. No, it's... it's... It's Peter. Trust me. No, I talked to him just this morning. He... He came to see me. The coroner said he's been dead for over 24 hours. Mom said they had a whole conversation. He sat with me and he told me Jake Dwight was okay. I don't know what to tell you, Hil. It's just not possible. Mom? Mom? - Cheers. - [laughing] [Peter] Next time, you might not be so lucky. [Scott] We drank too much in college. [Young Hildy] Is it okay if I have supper at Mamie's? [Emily] Oh, wow, Mom. A real hug! [Tess] I love that you're doing so well. [Rebecca] To the witches of Wendover. [gasps] Help me. [Tess] Mom. Will you help me? [no audible dialogue] [Hildy] While my daughter was scraping me up and getting me home, Rebecca was in Longfellow Woods. She'd been out riding all morning. She didn't even know Jake was missing. She didn't know Peter was gone. I'm grateful Rebecca found Jake. She was too. She got to be part of a happy ending. -[EMT 1] We need to move him quickly. -[EMT 2] Yeah. [Hildy] Peter's death was ruled an accident. But I knew better. My mother didn't leave a suicide note either. Peter and I were never taught to ask for help. My facade finally crumbled on that dock. And poor Peter, he couldn't imagine his life without one. [Hildy] Hi, Frank. Hildy. I, uh... I think this is what I owe you for fixing up the Dwight house. Never did get a bill. Yeah, I've been meaning to get to that. I also know it was you that bought the house. Yeah, well, I figured the Dwights were due for some good luck. I'll flip it. I also want you to know I'm going into rehab. And, uh, I'll probably be gone for a while. I, uh, got something I wanna show you. Come here. Where'd you find her? Well, I lost track of her, um, when I went into the army. And then I... [chuckles] came across her in a salvage yard around 20 years ago. - You've had her all this time? - Yeah. Well, I mean, she was in rough shape. I, uh... I took care of her, fixed her up. Why throw her away? No reason for that. She's always been perfectly good. Frankie. Do what you need to do, Hildy. I'm not going anywhere. I'll be right here. Waited this long. [chuckles] [sniffles] Mmm. Mmm. [chuckles] [Hildy] I went back to rehab. This time by choice. Uh, well... [chuckles] by necessity. And, uh... all I ever wanted was what we all want, which is meet a friend after work for drinks and have a couple of glasses of vino at a party. Beer at a barbecue. Of course, I wanted more than that. I wanted to get hammered out of my mind and... that's where I felt most comfortable. [clicks tongue] Uh, now I know I can't do that. I can't have a sip or a nip or a taste. I'm not special. I'm... I'm your garden-variety alcoholic. And I've gotta stop trying to convince the world that I don't have a problem. Because I do. And that's why I'm here. It's hard... giving up the old version of yourself. [Henry] Hmm. Hildy Good 2.0. Even better than the original. [sighs] ["Down to Zero" by Joan Armatrading plays] [song continues] [song ends]
