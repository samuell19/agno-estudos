Mr. Brookes. Mr. Brookes. Can you hear me? My family. Ray, do you know where you are? No. You're at St. Mark's Royal Infirmary in the High Dependency Unit. Do you know why you're here? You have suffered a serious wound to your chest, Ray. When you arrived in Intensive Care we... to ensure a proper recovery, had to administer an induced coma. Coma? Yes. How long? Rather a long time, Mr. Brookes. Three months. Three months? Yes. It was the time necessary to ensure a complete recovery. We began to wake you early this morning and you'll be glad to know everything's gone off without issue. I'm very pleased with your progress. Now, do you feel unwell at all? Any sickness or pain? Your throat's bound to be a bit sore but that's merely all the tubes we've been using to, um... to help you get better. My family. You may also experience some chest pains. Are they...? The... The police will want to speak with you. Are they dead? How many were there? Three. Did you recognize any of them? Oh, yeah. Yeah? You know their names? No. Where'd you recognize them from? When I was with the wife. Got lost with the SatNav, ended up in the industrial estate. What do you want to do? You know what? Think we should go old school. See if that map is in the glove compartment, will you? Oh! No map. It's not in here. You know what? It's in the boot. Oh, typical. Let me pull over. Please, please. Gentlemen. Please, Mr. Noonan. Frank, please. Tommy boy. Turns out we've got a bit of a problem, haven't we? You see, a little birdie tells me that you've got a bit of a mouth on you. Well, not a bit of a mouth. A big mouth. I mean, a mouth I can tolerate. That's what this business is about, you know that. But a big mouth, we can't be doing with that, can we? No, Frank. Mm-mm. No. Come on, it's not all bad. One thing I've learned over the years... you've got to draw positives from every negative. The example in this case being, honestly, I'm surprised you've lasted as long as you have. So, well done you! You can't say I didn't try to make something of you, Tommy. But sometimes a potter's got to know when the clay he's working with... is just no good. Well, I'm not here to pour water on a drowning man. - So let's get to it, shall we? - Please, Frank, listen. Ray? Ray, what is it? What's wrong? I don't know. What do you mean you don't know? There's something wrong, you're scaring me. Tell me what's wrong. He saw us. We saw him too. I think I saw an execution. What do you mean you think you just saw an execution? What happened? Four guys stood over a guy kneeling down. - I heard a gunshot. - A gunshot! Ray, this is serious, we've got to go to the police. No, we haven't. Just be quiet. - Did they see you? - I don't know. Did they or didn't they? I don't know, let me think. Be quiet. This is a nightmare just get us out of here. Faster! Right, um... If I show you some pictures or mugshots, you could take a look maybe we can identify the men that came to your house that night. And then you want me to testify? Yeah. You'll be our key witness. Not interested. These are gangsters. Real scumbags. We can offer you protection. I'll be dead before the trial. Mr. Brookes. Don't you want justice? I don't believe in the British justice system. I'm not gonna look over my shoulder for the rest of my life. They were my family. They still are my family. Yeah, you've been through a lot, you need to rest. Just think about what I said and give me call. Victoria, phone down, please. Do you want anything to eat? Toast? - No, I'm all right. - You okay? Yeah. - All right. What's up? - Hi, Dad. So, what time you off out this evening? Seven. Oh, and I have the honor of picking you up, I suppose? Yeah, why? That all depends doesn't it? On what? On whether you're prepared to put down the bloody phone. So, who you out with tonight? Kirsty. Kirsty. She the redhead? No, that's Sam. Where you going tonight then? - Just down the Kings. - Pub? Since when you been going down the pub? - Since she's been in love. - Shut up! - She's got a boyfriend. - Thanks. He's called Jamie. And he's old. How old? What's the big deal anyway? He's 19, okay? Pfft, 25 more like! You are such a little shit stirrer, Max. Yeah, but I'm not the one who likes old dudes. Dad, 25 is not old. Yeah, that's how it starts. The next thing you know you're noshing off pensioners on a manky old sofa. - Max. - That's just grim. I mean, why would you shag a man old enough to send you three quid taped to your birthday card? Just shut up. I mean, what do you do for foreplay with these oldies? Give 'em hard boiled sweets? - That is enough. - Max. So, you've known about this. Well, we did start going out when I was 16. Busted, Dad! You're so busted. - Be careful, won't you? - Yeah, all right. I mean, seriously. Ray, you okay? Yeah. Do you know what you're gonna do yet? - What we're gonna do? - No. I know I should report it but... I mean, that wasn't a random hit. That was a proper execution, you know? These are real gangsters and this is a small town. Look, I'll support you whatever you decide, you know that. - Don't you? - Yeah. All right. See you later. Hi, can I help you? Sorry to bother you, but my dog, he's a terrible little sod, he just got out of his lead and he ran off in this direction. I hate to ask, can you check your garden? Well, yeah, sure, what kind is it? Kind? - Oh, you mean breed. - Yes. He's a, uh, a Jack Russell. Oh, well, look, our fence is quite high at the back, so... Oh, yeah, so's his jump. Okay, if you just wait here I'll go and check for you. Thank you. Yeah, no dog, sorry. Oh, okay, well, thank you for your time. You might want to check next door. Their fence is a bit broken at the back and it's lower so you might have more luck. Will do. Thanks again. Bye. Not a fucking word. Get off me! - Dad! - Ray! Shut the fuck up and sit down! All of you! Bastards. Look at Ray, giving it large, it was all Niagara Falls a minute ago. It's all done. Three computers, three phones? And Ray's makes four. Keep this up, son. You might just live through this. Now, kill this nosy bitch. I said kill her. Now! Now! No! Oy. Fuckhead. Do you remember me? Do you remember me? Yeah. You'll know why I'm here then, won't you? Five minutes out of prison you're back on this shit. Suck my dick, old man. You remember my family's name? I'm gonna give you some names and then you're gonna give me some names. Why don't you fuck off, man? Max. Victoria. Kim. Fuck off. Fuck you, you fucking cunt! No more fucking games from you, fucking junkie. What's the name of the others? I'll fucking cut it off. I'll stick you straight in the fucking balls. Connor O'Brien! And? Kane Keegan! Keegan! Now, cook some more of that shit up. Cook some more of that shit up! It's what you like, isn't it? More. Fucking heap it on there. You fucking junkie piece of shit. My fucking family. You come here often? Excuse me? I said do you come here often? Has anyone ever told you that's the oldest line there is? What, you think I'm trying to chat you up? Never mind. You here with anyone? I'm waiting for someone. This someone a bloke? Yes. Lucky fucker. Very lucky fucker. What can I help you with? - Mr. Brookes, how are you? - All right. Guess I've come around for that chat. I hadn't heard anything from you so I presume you have nothing pressing to tell me, but I thought maybe you could look through those pictures I mentioned. I've told you everything I know, I don't see what good this will do. Just take a look. Could be helpful. You ever heard of someone called William or Billy Malone? No. If you read the papers you probably would have. He's just been found murdered. I don't read the papers. He's an associate of Frank Noonan. Who's he? Prominent figure on the wrong side of the law. Deals in prostitution, gambling, drugs, racketeering. You name it. What we're concerned about is that his enterprise seems to be expanding beyond the walls of our fair city. Sounds like just another gangster. Yeah. I always found that term a little bit too glamorous. Well, gangster or no gangster, I've never heard of him. I mentioned another name to you when we were in hospital. Tommy Richards. Yeah, I remember. Word on the street is that Noonan and his crew took him out. Had him executed. His body was found on the industrial estate outside Montague Road. Along where you say you witnessed a murder. Yeah. Yeah, what's curious to me is that someone can witness four murders, three of them being his own family and he doesn't wanna cooperate with police. I need to remind you, Ray, that withholding information about a murder is a criminal offense. I've told you. I've told you everything I know. And I just don't wanna spend the rest of my life looking over my shoulder so why don't you just give me that? I told you, we can protect you. I don't want your protection. Then you want justice, right? For your family? There's no court in this land that will give me my justice. That's all. Police are yet to reveal information on a possible motive or suspect in the murder of William Malone. Police have reported the 27-year-old was fatally stabbed in his home on Empress Drive in what is believed to have been a botched drug deal. Police sources have indicated... Why are you fidgeting? I need the toilet. Speak up. I need the toilet. Please. You. Take her to the loo. If she tries anything you know what to do. And don't you try anything either. If you try to get away the first thing I'll do is go back down there and cut them all. One by one. Okay? Whoa, whoa, whoa. What do you think you're doing? I can't just go with you standing there. Well, you don't really have much choice do you? Where am I gonna go? You got two minutes. Come on, time's up. Can I just wash my hands? No, you're taking the piss. Listen to me, poppet. You really wanna waste my time? Why don't you go in there and show me to your room like a good girl, yeah? Come on. Come and have a seat. Come on. I don't bite. There we go. That wasn't so hard, was it? Why don't you lie back? Get comfy. Stop playing hard to get, you. There we go, that wasn't so bad. You are very pretty, aren't you? Just like a little dolly. Are you a virgin? Hey, hey, hey. Relax. Relax. Are you a virgin? Get off. Go for it. For what? The gun. Go on. Let me tell you something. I'll get there quicker. So you got a choice. Make a move and I'll carve that pretty little face of yours. Or lie back and get wet for me. What the fuck do you think you're doing? - Hmm? - I didn't touch her. Cover yourself up. Stand there. Downstairs. Come on, come on. Pick up. Fuck. Come on, Kane, where the fuck are you? What the fuck is this? What you gonna do, huh? You just gonna shoot me in the back of the head, yeah? You ain't got it in you, you fucking coward. Like what you did to my daughter? You? No. No, you're fucking dead. Not me. Just your pal, Billy Malone. Kane made us do all that shit. There was orders. We was forced. You don't understand. You're all guilty. Did you show any remorse when you shot my daughter? Your turn! Come on, baby girl, let's get you up. There we go. Have a look around, what's going on there? You know, it's a shame, we could've been more than friends. No! No! Did you feel anything? What? When you killed Billy. Shut up. How 'bout I make this nice and easy for you, yeah? How 'bout this? Come on. Come on. How 'bout this? You know, the only thing I regret is that I didn't get to fuck your daughter. You won't be fucking anyone else. Yeah, if you make it quick, I'm a bit busy. I see. Back at work? No. Maybe next week. I'm sure your students will be very happy to see you, Ray. Yeah. Mind if I take a seat? Sure. So, as I said, I'm pretty busy. Connor O'Brien. Does the name seem familiar to you? No. He was found murdered last night. Another one of Noonan's associates. Who's Noonan? The criminal we discussed last time. Oh, yeah. Seems we're going around in circles a little bit here. It does, doesn't it? Look, forensics are doing their bit to try and find a link between the O'Brien and the Malone murders but it's gonna take some time. And that's why I'm here, Ray. See if we can clear some of this up. Rest assured, they are gonna find a connection. That's good, I mean, I've told you everything I know. And I'm not gonna testify. Mmm. Ray. Look, Noonan's gang may be small, but they're on the rise and the two victims used to run with Kane Keegan. All right? He's the second in command to Noonan. So, it seems to me that someone is working their way up the chain of command. I'm a P.E. teacher, I don't know about this gangster stuff. Yeah. The gun that killed O'Brien's been traced back to Malone. Now, Billy may have been a junkie and a loose cannon, but it doesn't take a lab to tell me that he didn't kill O'Brien. He was busy. Lying on a slab. So, whoever killed them left Billy's place with the gun, and left a scene of a struggle at both locations. That's very sloppy, Ray. There's one thing I know about Noonan's gang is they aren't sloppy. So, we're looking for an outsider, and although I think we're all better off without the likes of Malone and O'Brien... I can't have a trigger happy vigilante on my streets. It looks as though you're making a lot of assumptions, doesn't it? It's all part of the investigation. So, if there's nothing further you can tell us. All right if I take a look around? Don't you need a search warrant for that? Oh, I see. That's a nasty cut you got there, Ray. Shaving incident? Yeah. Sure. I'll show myself out, shall I? Yeah, wouldn't be a bad idea. I'll be in touch. Kim! Max! Victoria? They're fine for now. What's going on? Who are you? What's going on? Where's my family? I think you know what's going on, don't you Ray? No. Where's my family? I'll tell you a little story, Ray. Something you'll be used to being a teacher, Ray. Once upon a time... there was a kid called Tommy. Tommy Richards. Tommy The Gun to his mates. Not that he had many. Tommy used to do a bit of wheeling and dealing around Bethnal Green, E2, them sort of places, you know. And after a while the wheeling and dealing wasn't enough for him. He wanted more. He wanted bigger. What's this got to do with me? I don't understand this. And soon enough, just like his old dad... he got nicked. Didn't take quite the same pride in his work as his dad though. Instead of doing his time like a man, he became a little grass. He went straight in the back pocket of Scotland Yard and tried selling us down the fucking river. Please, where's my family? Don't hurt my family. You know what happened to Tommy? Let me put it this way. The thick ear wasn't quite enough for him. His punishment needed to be a little bit more, how can I put it, shall we say a little bit more permanent? Je... God. Don't get me wrong though, Ray. There are other pieces, mate, would not fit in my fucking pocket. I don't know anything, I don't. What's going on here? I think you know what's going on. I don't know, I swear, I never saw anything. My family, don't hurt them. You see, I've been doing this a long time, Ray. Fear is all in the eyes. Look at me. Fucking look at me. All in the eyesies. Let's get to it. I want all your computers, laptops, fucking gadgets, all that bollocks, right? Okay. Don't waste my time, get them to me quickly. And then it won't get messy for your fucking wife and kids. Okay. Get off me! - Dad! - Ray! Oh, shit... Shut the fuck up and sit down! All of you! Bastards. You're a smart man, Ray, you must be. You're a teacher so now it's time for you to use your big brain. Gonna ask you a question, you're gonna tell me the truth. You know how I hate liars. Have you or have you not blagged to the filth? What about? Fuck. What about? He strains me. My patience is wearing thin, Ray. Gonna ask you again. Have you fucking blagged to the old Bill? No. You plan to, don't you? No. Am I supposed to take your word for that? I don't know why you've come here or what you want but please leave my family alone. Take it out on me. It's up to you whether or not your family live, mate. Are you married? What fucking difference does that make? Because if you were and you had a family, you'd know what I'm going through. You wouldn't be doing this. Difference between you and me, Ray, is this is my business. It's not personal. Might be personal for you. How far would you go to keep your pretty wife and those little cherubs alive? How far? How far would you go, Ray? I'd kill you. You'd fucking kill me, would you? You'd kill me, yeah? Oy, you. You're ruining this lovely family photo, mate. Go on, jog on. Now which one of these lovely children, Kim, which one do you love the most? - This one? I thought so. - No! Now if your husband doesn't shut his fucking mouth... What's this? Blended, Ray? Please. What's this? Single malt. That's much more like it. That's class. Fucking lovely, Ray, thank you. Don't shoot anyone! No! Where's that boy gone? Leave him! Please, leave him alone! No! Get the fuck away from me! Little cunt. Get off! Mom, help! Get off me! Get off me! Get off! Shut up. I didn't come here to play hide and fucking seek. I came here for a nice little sit down. No. I gave you every chance not to fuck me about. But now, your fault this, you leave me no choice. - Frank. - Kane. You've really fucked this up, haven't you? Excuse me? I've been making some inquiries. What do you mean inquiries? Thank you. I've been in touch with some faces. Now, you won't know them, because they don't exactly run around with our lot. Not because they're being rude or antisocial or anything like that, they do pop into the club from time to time but shall we say, their superiors would be none too impressed if they knew. Superiors? You mean fucking pigs. Kane. Come along. I set them up with the girls sometimes when they're feeling lonely, on the house, of course, because as you're about to discover it serves a purpose for us to lubricate these particular relationships. Now, with Connor and Billy lost to the morgue, uniforms are everywhere like little insects. But fortunately they take their sweet time about things. However my guys tell me that a list of suspects is being drawn up and cutting to the chase, I have those names. One of them's a ghost. I put a bullet in this cunt. Mmm. Yes, I'm sure. But the annoying thing, Kane, is that he didn't die. Did he? I don't fucking believe this. No, I'm quite sure you don't. But you do understand the rules regarding loose ends. So, what I would like you to do now, please, is to find him and put another bullet in the resilient little bastard. Okay? And perhaps if there's any doubt at that stage, just remove his head and bring me that. Why? Because I can. I'm gonna hunt you to the end of the Earth. So, what? We just gonna do each other? Up to you. I've told you, Ray, it's just business for me. And it's just personal for me. Put the guns down, now! Both of you, put the weapons down! You a copper? DI Shelby, and you're Kane Keegan. Now, put the gun down and back away. You too, Ray. That'd be a bad move for me. Me too. Come on, Ray, this isn't you. Think about your family. That's all I've been thinking of. You think killing him's gonna bring them back? You think it's gonna take away the grief? Think about it, think about Kim, Vicky, Max. Come on, Ray. I'm sick of all this family bollocks. Now I have my justice. So, what now, do you get to arrest me? Ray, I am sorry about your family. People are gonna have a lot of questions and I'm gonna have to give them answers. You need to go and I don't just mean from here. You need to leave town and not come back. You're a suspect and in the morning they were gonna bring you in for questioning. Tomorrow I'm gonna go round your house. And if you're there you will be arrested. Do you understand? Yeah. Oh, Ray. They will come looking for you and they will not stop. If you pass out in my bar again you will pay dearly for it. Well, well. I see you've brought a little toy along with you. Or is this your idea of a joke? Either way, we're closed. Come back later. Now, who do you think you are? Hmm? This has been the longest week of my life. And I've been thinking long and hard about what to say to you when we finally came face to face. I wondered if you would intimidate me. Or if you'd just be the weak and pathetic person that you are. I thought about showing you pictures of my family you took away from me. I don't want to listen to your excuses. I've been a teacher for 15 years. But today I learned something new. Really? And what was that? That your arms are just too short to box with God? No. Talk is cheap. Reporting multiple casualties, over. Suspect has fled the scene, over. Suspect is Caucasian male, approximately six foot. Dark hair, dressed in a black bomber jacket and blue jeans, over. Suspect is considered armed and dangerous. Repeat, armed and dangerous. Caution advised. Subrip by DanDee
