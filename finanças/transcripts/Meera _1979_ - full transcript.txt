You Tube - Video Running Time 02:19:32 You Tube search name - Hema Malini Best Movie - Meera (1979) {HD + Eng Subs) - Vinod Khanna - Bollywood Superhit Movie Father, we shouldn't be helping Rana Vikramjeet. What has he done for us? Jaimal, this is not the issue of the enlistment of the Sisodias. The day Vikramjeet looses against the Mughals, it will be our turn. We'll cross that bridge when we get to it. We'd rather die than bow to the Mughals. What Mansingh did was not done, but... - You were saying something? - I feel there will be a twist. This time something or the other will happen. - Which means? - I have received news that... Akbar has sired a son. - And the mother is Jodhabai Mansingh's sister. - So? So the Mughal Rajput is the crown prince of Hindustan. He'll ascend the throne. - Only if he's alive. - You only think about Menta. Menta is only a small part of Hindustan. What, in your opinion, should we do, father? We have to accept Akbar's sovereignty. And if we have to fight we've to join hands with Vikramjeet. Otherwise, on our own, we'll lose... God bless you. - Mother, where is Krishna? - Have patience. You are very much concerned about your sister. - Have you ever inquired about me? - But mother, you are right here. Whereas she will get married and leave some day. What about the proposal from Ajmer? I've sent them a message that I'll meet them soon. - What did you get for me? - Take this. - And for Meera? - She has asked for a ring. - But brother, this is for me? - So? This stone won't suit her. She is a saint. We must first get her married. Even though she's not my daughter, I feel concerned for her. I want to get both of them married on the same day. - To the same man? - This girl is mad. - She's an imp! - Brother, what about my necklace? I'll give you that as a wedding gift. Now don't ask when you'll get that. - When will you get it? - I know that. And when will the marriage be? - When you find a suitable boy. - That's the difficult part. You also make her understand what Meera's mother explained. "I love Krishna and nobody else." "I love Krishna and nobody else." "You are only my husband." "I love Krishna and nobody else." "He's the only one for me." "He is the Lotus-Eyed One." "He is Omniscient." "Some like jewellery..." "I love Krishna and nobody else." "I love Krishna and nobody else." "But all this means nothing." "I'm adorned with jewels..." "But they don't fascinate me." "I love Krishna and nobody else." "I love Krishna and nobody else." "You are only my husband." "I love Krishna and nobody else." Just find out where Meera and Krishna have gone? They've gone to the riverside. They'll go to the Krishna temple on the other side of the river. This is the Sisodia territory. What if something happens? But Meera is an ardent devotee of Sri Krishna. We too are His devotees but she's obsessed with Him. - Priest, I've got a lamp for the temple. - May God bless you! Child, come in. Priest, why is this temple in ruins? - Don't devotees come here? - Devotees do come, but very few. The royal family worships Mother Durga. So the subjects also pray to Her. The offerings are there. - Where are you taking him? - Madam, you take the boat. - I'll deal with them. - So you've come from Menta? - Let him go. - No, and you can't leave either. Don't you know, people from Menta are forbidden to come here? Will you let us go or not? They've come from Menta. You seem to hail from the royal family? Cover your head. - You are Virandev's daughter. - Say King Virandev. What is the matter, Krishna? Don't you know, people from Menta are forbidden from coming here? Don't you know Jaimal had insulted our family deity? Let them go, but hereafter... if you spot any Mentaite drown them in the river. Child, leave immediately. If he sees you again, the Rana will harass me. - Who was he? - Didn't you recognize him? - No. - He was Rana Vikramjeet's younger brother. Meera, come, let's go. On the next moonless day, the war shall end. I've accepted this proposal from Akbar. During the festival of colours, he wants to celebrate his son's birth. The Emperor has shown foresight in deciding upon the day. I realized his wisdom the day he married a Rajput girl. We'll have to again prepare the army. Every soldier is very valuable. The Rajput's are tired of war. They must be given all comforts. - Where is Bhoj? - He's gone to Chittor to arrange for fresh forces. Ask him to come back immediately. There's a message from Akbar. He has invited us to celebrate his son's birth. He says we can fight anytime... but this is festival time and my son's birth... so let's forget our differences. It's so typical of him. - Will you go? - No, but I'll surely send a gift. After all, Mansingh is my relative as well. We've received congratulatory notes... from every nook 8 corner of Hindustan. Tansen, along with precious gems we also received dry-fruits... do you want to know what he's sent for me? Asafoetida! Because they know I like my lentils tempered with asafoetida. They know I'm a resident of Hindustan. That I'm a Hindustani and not an invader from Samarkhand. The dead bodies of my ancestors are proof that I'm a Hindustani. I'm glad that even Rajput blood flows in my son's veins. Do you know what the Rajput's have sent as gift on my dear son's birth? Can you identify this? This is a harp that a snake charmer uses to charm a snake. Can you play it? Rana Vikramjeet Singh has sent this gift for me. So that I learn to play it for the snake I've given birth to. I'm sorry for this, Emperor. Mansingh, it's I who am sorry for not controlling myself. Do you know what the Shia community from Hindustan have sent me? Uncover it. This sandalwood paste, this sacred thread and the cymbals... this is what they've sent for me. They taunt me for being a Hindu. I want such a faith for my son... that is above all barriers of religion... and can reveal his country's name, his individuality. "Hey Krishna..." - Greetings! - Greetings! Is Jaimal, I mean... is King Jaimal at home? - He's gone to Aimer but... - Cover your head. How could you come here? Did the people of Menta fail to recognize you? No... The colors of holi disguised me. No... The colors of holi disguised me. Instead, the festival was merciful with you. Even we know how to get even. Your watch is so vigilant that we dare not cross the river. Let me know if you have any work on the other side of the river. As such, we won't let the habitats of Menta step there. How dare you talk like this while you're still in Menta? Child, whom are you arguing with? I'm Bhojraj, Rana Vikramjeet's younger brother. My brother has sent a message for you. You've really grown up! It's ages since I last saw you. Dear, get some color. Let me first play holi with him. - You seem forlorn. - Damn you! Brother has said that he'll meet you at whichever place you decide. He'd like to come here also if it's fine by you. In fact, it will be an honour to have him as a guest. He has honored me by sending you here... I'll repay it by meeting him on his home ground. - I heard he's come back to Chittor? - That's right. The war is stalled for a while and so he's at home. I agree that the Rajput's are a force to reckon with. We did fight valiantly. But how long can we sustain with a handful of forces? How long can we fight Akbar? If we fight amongst ourselves, it'll be easier for Akbar to defeat us. I too am thinking on the same lines. That if we get united we can form a large army. If Menta joins us the other small provinces too will join us. I'm with you. But our enmity will not end. As you wish. In the vein of continuing our enmity... take my younger brother under your wing. What? Give your daughter Krishna's hand in marriage to him. I've fixed Krishna's marriage. Here is the token. Distribute it to everyone. Where is Jaimal? Why are you so dazed, Queen? I've fixed the date for the next full moon day. You'll sacrifice your daughter? Yes, Kuwarbai. But this is the time when the Rajputs need to be united. - So this compromise... - But Jaimal has gone for... - I'll make him see sense. - This is not possible, King. I'll not sacrifice my sister by getting her married to a Sisodia. The people from Aimer have even sent the token. Father, I too have fixed the date for the next full moon day. No, Jaimal. There will be an outrage. There will be an outrage if this alliance breaks. Don't worry, father. Even the King of Aimer is with us now. - We'll deal with these Sisodias. - Shut up! Don't only talk about destruction. History is not made by slaughtering lambs. You'll be finished if you don't project a united stand now. If die you must, then die for a goal. You can't become brave just by wielding a sword. You must always die a soldier's death. - But those people... - Go... and just follow my instructions. Explain to them that this is not my daughter's marriage... but this a marriage between the Rathores and the Sisodias. Jaimal has still not returned. Yes, there is no news from him. Perhaps he will get back tomorrow. Is there anything lacking in the marriage preparations? No! We'll gift her a palace. As regards the necklace of the rare gems... that Jaimal will gift his sister. But what does Krishna want? Rajput girls never go against their parents' wishes. Rajput girls live and die for their husbands as Satis. I wonder what's taking Jaimal so long. Is there still no news from him? What will happen now? Both the bridegrooms have arrived. The Ajmer Prince won't let the Sisodia Prince marry her. Many Rajput's will be slain for a marriage. None will return without the bride. What will happen now? Let them fight amongst themselves. It'll make things easier for Akbar. C'mon let's go out, the groom's procession has come. What else do you wish to do, you are looking good. Come, let's go out. Dear, I don't know if I took the right step. But I finalized your marriage to Bhojraj for a cause. This was the only way I could've united the warring Rajputs. Only by sacrificing you... could I have put an end to this age-old enmity. And so I sacrificed you. But all this was futile. Now I've no other means to unite the warring Rajputs. I've no other means. Now only you can save them. Brother, what about my necklace? I'll present you that as a wedding gift. Krishna can't die for my sake. I can understand what must've happened. I too am a Rajput and have sacrificed my family for the country. This dead body won't be taken. No. The marriage will take place. She was not your daughter but my daughter-in-law. She's still not dead. She'll die tomorrow in her in-laws home. We'll perform all the rites there. The cause for which this marriage was fixed... will surely be met. Brother, in Rajput families, corpses are not married off. I'm proud of my husband who for the sake of his country... could poison his own daughter. I'm also proud of my daughter who obeyed her father unquestiongly. And gave up her life. You'd only said that Rajput women can become satis for their husbands they can even live for their husbands. If all your lineage wants is one of my daughters... then Meera is also my daughter. Marry her. "O Lord, I am an ascetic." "O Lord, I am an ascetic." "Meera without her Shyam." "O Lord, I am an ascetic." "Is incomplete." "I am married to someone now." "But my heart still belongs to my Lord." "O Lord, I am an ascetic." - Whose marriage is it? - The king's daughter's. - And who's the one riding the horse? - The bridegroom. - Meera, don't move. - And who's my groom? Lord Girdhar is your groom. Lord Girdhar! "Only my body leaves, my soul is with my Lord." "My Lord means..." "Everything to me." "O Lord, I am an ascetic." "O Lord, I am an ascetic." "You are the only one I know." "I'll serve you all my life." "O Lord, I am an ascetic." "O Lord, I am an ascetic." Sister-in-law! What is all this? No rituals were observed. Nor did she seek any elder's blessings. You saw she was in no state to perform the rituals. Then you could have put her in the guest house for a day. How can she enter her new home without performing the rituals? I have performed all the rituals. What else do you want? She only has to perform her part of the rituals. Will you do that for her? I too have seen many brides but none who gets fits like this. Think rationally. If your in-laws want to take your bridal palanquin over my dead body... wouldn't you have been in a similar state? Krishna's last rites were yet not over. - How are you feeling now? - Better. I was waiting for you. I'm sorry... that this had to happen on my first day in your house. Don't worry. I don't think I'll be able to keep you happy. But I'll try not to hurt you any further. Krishna died and I... Do you feel caged? You know that this alliance was solemnized for a cause. We have to honor that ideal. I may not have any other relation with you. As per the norms of politics, the Rathores did make a compromise. But couldn't cleanse their hearts of their hatred for the Sisodias. I don't hate the Sisodias. - Then what is the reason? - It's my faith, my lover! You love somebody else? Yes. Is he a Rathore? No. - A Sisodia. - No. Then who is he? I've played with him as a child. And when I grew up, I've loved only him. Then why didn't your parents get you married to him? I've already been married to him. Who is he? Krishna! - Who Krishna? - The one whose idol I've brought. I didn't expect you to have such a good sense of humor. You think I'm joking. Don't you believe me? I believe you but I too have married you. Don't you trust me? You'll believe once you wear this. - Despite knowing that I'm already married? - Yes. That marriage is your soul's and this is wordly. You'll never separate it from your body. - Vikramjeet has not come? - He's gone to the battlefield. He's sent his sword for the sacrifice. Praised be Mother Kali! Offer the Prasad to the goddess and send it to the royal kitchen. Break this and put it into this. Take this out of the kitchen. What are you saying, Queen Mother? This is Prasad. Maybe, but still take it out of the kitchen. This is meat. This is not raw meat but Prasad. The chief priest has personally performed the sacrifice. Don't disrespect it. I'm not disrespecting anybody's prayers. I'm only saying that meat will not be cooked here. But this is the norm followed in this house. We can't feed vegetables to the saints we've invited. This is unprecedented. Over here, you'll have to follow our customs. I've been entrusted with the responsibilities of this house. This is my feast and only I'll decide what is to be cooked. Is this your house or mine? I've been told it's my house. Ask your brother if it's yours also. Priest, shall I serve the food? - Will you accept the offerings? - Certainly! Then what about the Prasad that you sent? - Shall I throw it away? - Anger leads to destruction. I'm the priest of the Kshatriyas and we worship Goddess Durga. Meat is also an offering which the daughter-in-law cooks to feed us. Pardon me, priest. Sister did suggest it, but I refused. The Goddess is like a mother who gives life, not takes it. Stay in your limits and don't argue with the priest. I like to discuss with her. She seems learned. - What is your contention? - It is like the stone in the grains. I only have devotion and love and that too only for my Krishna. Krishna, who steals butter is ignorant of all these things. Dear, these are the palaces of the brave Rajputs. To resolve the nation's problems... Kshatriyas can't sing hymns on the war front... they have to wield weapons. They'll become weak if their diet consists only of butter. It was that weak butter thief had told Arjun... to fight and wield weapons. Then why do you resist the offerings of these swords? These swords should be used against the enemy on the battlefield... not on helpless and innocent animals and birds. It is cowardice to do so. Meera, will you serve food or just argue? Priest, shall I serve the food? Everyone is very hungry. I've experienced hunger pangs in your maternal home. I was kept starving while my hands and legs were tied. But you can't punish me for that? Enough! I made a mistake by arguing with a lady. And to atone for that, I won't speak to anybody for five days. Shall I serve you food? "I yearn for my Krishna." "I yearn for my Krishna." "I am lost in Your memories." "I yearn for my Krishna." "I have forsaken everything for You." "And yet, I am not at peace." "The pangs of separation are unbearable." "I yearn for my Krishna." "I am lost in Your memories." - Greetings, brother! - God bless you! - How are you and my daughter-in-law? - Fine. God bless you. I'm sorry for not attending the feast prepared by you. But now I'll eat the food cooked by you. Did you keep my share or did the sages polish off everything? Brother, eat fresh food that's being cooked instead of the stale one. Prasad is never stale although it does get cold. - Daughter-in-law, heat it up. - But... I hadn't cooked meat so even he didn't eat it. - Only vegetarian food was cooked. - Why? Wasn't the sacrifice made? The sacrifice was made but as Meera was fasting... You also fast on Tuesdays? My mother also fasted. And so she would also never cook the sacrificial lamb. I still remember how Bhojraj ate meat at aunt's house. Anyway, I'll eat only what you've cooked. Meera, I too will eat with brother. You seem happy? You don't think I am happy? - What are you making? - A turban. - For whom? - I'm dressing Krishna like a Rajput. As the country, so the look. Tell me, what is your relationship with Krishna? What a woman should have with her man. - And with me? - You are my lord. - If you don't like it, then... - I heard you were jealous of Radha. - Who told you so? - Lalita told me. - She carries tales against me. - No, in fact she keeps praising you. I found it strange that you are jealous of Radha? But not anymore as I too experience that emotion for you. - Has brother left? - Yes, brother was praising you. He was saying that you are very virtuous. Oh yes... Brother has entrusted me with a great responsibility. She said these are the house keys. You only keep it. - Brother has given it to you, so you keep it. - But, I... Give it somebody, I'll give my jewels also for safe keeping. My mother-in-law had rightly said... that I was marrying a monk. And that jewels won't satisfy you. And that she only craves for love. But she is always preoccupied. I heard you sing very well and you write too. I've often seen you jotting down something. - You must've read it too. - No, I've not stolen anything. Sing for me. "The Rana praised a monk." "Radha got upset and the town people ran helter skelter." "O Lord, bless me." "O Lord, bless me." "I long for a glimpse of Thee." "Meera yearns for You in the bylanes of Vrindavan." "O Lord, bless me." "I yearn to behold You." "O Lord, bless me." "O Lord, bless me." "Your blue form is adorned with a peacock feather." "Vrindavan is the pious place where You dwell." "You are Meera's Lord." "Always stay close to her." "Lord, let me behold You at midnight." "O Lord, bless me." "I long for a glimpse of Thee." "Meera yearns for You in the bylanes of Vrindavan." "O Lord, bless me." "O Lord, bless me." "O Lord, bless me." "O Lord, bless me." Child! There is lot of devotion in your voice. Blessed is the family you've married into. Your voice has the sweetness of saints and the longing of a beloved. Meeting and separation are two sides of a coin. Sing on this musical instrument. Take it Ask her what was she doing in the temple? And who has given her this musical instrument? I met a saint at the Krishna temple near the river. - He gave it to me. - Brother, he was the cobbler Raidas. She mingles with just about anybody. Was he really the saint Raidas? Anybody singing hymns becomes a saint. If you continue to sing there, you too will be known as a saint. Brother, ask her how she was dancing with gay abandon. Meera, your living seems different. Why? Is singing hymns prohibited in this house? The daughters of this house don't go out without permission. You had told me that I'm not a slave. But I also never said that you are free. Give me this guitar. Don't try to take this from me. Whatever you want to say, say it to your brother. I don't want anything. I feel like renouncing the world. Meera, you can't do that now. I'll either go to Kashi to saint Tulsidas or to saint Raidas. I'm at my wit's end. Meera, calm down. You have certain duties towards your husband also. Why doesn't he take me with him whom I've taken as my husband? Why is He playing games with me? I'm not Radha who'll wait patiently for Him. I'll respond to His flute. Brother left in the morning and has yet not returned. He must've gone to Udaipur to meet Vikramjeet. You know he can't leave Chittor without brother's orders. On the day of the feast also, the same thing had happened. He went to the forest and just kept riding aimlessly. - His mind is not at peace. - I know. These are days of the war and he shouldn't be in a state... that can mar his thinking. Shall I send Meera to her mother's home for a few days? - If Bhoja wishes. - What is your advice? This will be best for Meera also. - Orders? - Whose is playing the flute? The cowherd routinely takes the cows to graze at this time... and returns at dusk. - Ask him to change his path. - As you wish. Distribute the rest amongst the devotees. - Priest, I've brought this for you. - God bless you, child. You've revived this dying temple. With your coming here other devotees too has started frequenting it. Does the Lord also come? I come in search of Him. Devotees are a form of the Lord. You too are one of His forms. When God was going to Vrindavan, Radha came... Priest, don't talk about Radha. - Why? - She is my rival in love. Devotees are all alike. Then address her as Meera or me as Radha. Meera, the Rana must have woken up. When did he sleep to wake up? I'm responsible for his condition. - What is this? - The Rana has asked you to visit your parents. And has said that... What is the Rana's message? He's said that he'll send for you when he needs you. 'Without telling anything you did what I wished for.' We sent you as a bride. And the Sisodias made a saint of you. Brother, I'm at fault, not the Rana. Then why did you come here? Now everything is your husband for you. Didn't mother tell you this at the time of your marriage? Pardon me. But since the Rana deserted me you too are behaving thus. You are fighting with everyone. Ask mother to bless me. So that I can fulfill my incomplete training. You cannot accompany me. I've to do this journey all alone. Sudhakar, come here. See that the lamp doesn't get lit off. - Who's that? - It's me, Meera. If you are Meera than why this 'I'? Sit down, child. - What do you want? - Will I get alms? When I was blank, I thought I had everything. When I got something, I thought I got less. I want knowledge. A word of love... is entire library. Wasn't devotion enough that you want knowledge too... from a low caste man... and illiterate. You came here from Rajputana. If you had went north, you would've reached Kashi. You would've met Tulsidas. Go to Tulsi. He's a scholar. He'll teach you. You imbibed it. "I took the form of my beloved." "I took the form of my beloved." "I adorned myself." "I left all inhibitions." "I took the form of my beloved." "I took the form of my beloved." "Customs and traditions..." "Has been cast away." "Customs and traditions..." "Has been cast away." "Ornaments of your name..." "Ornaments of your name..." "And vermillion has being applied on the forehead." "Meera became your devotee." "Meera became your devotee." "I took the form of my beloved." "I adorned myself." "I left all inhibitions." "I took the form of my beloved." "I took the form of my beloved." Daughter-in-law. This temple won't open again. Is this Rana's order? Kings don't meddle in religion. To protect the religion... I can even order your king. So this temple was closed on your orders. It could be demolished too on my orders. Priests will have to change God on your orders. Don't argue with me, daughter-in-law. I could've given death penalty to that priest... who interfered in king's duty. It's my right to get that penalty. I've interfered. I give you chance to repent. Tomorrow is husband's day. Fast for your husband and offer penance. Your husband is your God. Yes. God is my husband. You've locked my God... behind bars. I... will fast for him. I'll break the fast... when he appears. You think this temple will open again. I don't know. You've the right to shut the door... but you can't stop God. I don't know... if you'll open or... God will open himself. Daughter-in-law. I'll give the news of your arrival to Bhoj. I'll tell him... Meera is testing her belief. Order her... if she wants to return home dejected... I don't mind. What did you bring? - Food. - For whom? You. Mother has sent it. She knows I'm fasting. Fast for husband's day is over, queen. Look at the moon and break the fast. She knows... when I'll break my fast. You don't know, Uda. She won't break fast like this. You don't know how stubborn she's. I didn't know earlier. Now I'll know... when she breaks the fast. "Wake up, God with flute!" "Lord." "Wake up, God with flute!" "Night has passed." "It's dawn again." "Every door is opening one by one." "Wake up, God with flute!" "Lord." Queen didn't even drink water. Let it be. It's good. She'll die sooner than later. I'll see... who opens the door of the temple. "Bless me with your sight." "Without you..." "I can't live." "Bless me with your sight." "I am like a night without moon." "I am destitute without you." "I roam anxiously." "My heart pines." "Beloved." "Bless me with your sight." "O' Lord, clouds scare me." "O' Lord, clouds scare me." "Dark clouds have gathered." "Quench my thirst." "O' Lord, clouds scare me." Today is the 14th day. How long can she live without food and water? Let her die. Who needs her? Brother... has gone mad. I'm not interested in sacrifing... thousands of my soldiers for my stubbornness. I love my soldier's life as my own. For my own principles, I can sacrifice... my life and his too. Akbar is delusional if he thinks his religion can unite India. Religion isn't a country. Religion is religion. My faith is witness... that before going to war... I let Jodhabai apply vermillion on my forehead. And I swear by holy Koran to do justice. I don't want to force my religion on anyone. I do want... that India should become one. And this one community should say united... that we're Indians. Our nation is India. Sword can't decide this. Only love can decide that. For that you don't need strength... but devotion. Meera, you talk like sages. If I could write and sing like you... I would've taken Sitar to battle. But I can't use that weapon. I want your souvenir before leaving. Tie it. I promise... as long as I'm alive... I won't separate from you. Won't you apply vermillion. I'll get it. What happened? What happened? Tell me. My Gopal... Where is my Krishna? Who took it? Did you move it? Go up and meet him! This new temple was made for you. So that you don't have to go out for devotion... and the honor of this family... should be saved from your shamelessness. Lalita. "You can, but I won't sever..." "You can, but I won't sever..." "With whom else can I forget bond but you?" "With whom else can I forget bond but you?" "You can, but I won't sever..." "You can, but I won't sever..." "You are river and I'm your fish." "You are river and I'm your fish." "You are earth, I'm dust." "You are moon, I'm moonlight." "You can, but I won't sever..." "You can, but I won't sever..." "You are pearl and I'm the string." "You are pearl and I'm the string." "You are God, I'm your devotee." "Meera says, God..." "Meera says, God of Brij..." "Meera says, God of Brij..." "I'm your slave." "You can, but I won't sever..." "You can, but I won't sever..." "With whom else can I forget bond but you?" "With whom else can I forget bond but you?" "You can, but I won't sever..." "You can, but I won't sever..." Go to Chittaur. And give me the correct news. I heard Meera has left home. Ok, king. "A mendicant is always lost in thought." "A mendicant is always lost in thought." "They settle in towns or forests." "A mendicant is always lost in thought." "They sleep on carpet and on ground too." "They sleep on carpet and on ground too." "Meera says, O' Lord..." "Meera says, O' Lord..." "Bear all trouble with a smile." "A mendicant is always lost in thought." "They settle in towns or forests." "A mendicant is always lost in thought." I'm only a singer, king... but she's composer. Is there any other voice better than yours in India, Tansen. It's a voice of devotion, king... and of love. Since I heard... it's echoing in my mind and heart. I too want to hear that voice. "I've only Girdhar Gopal, no one else." "I've only Girdhar Gopal, no one else." "With a crown of feather..." "He looks alluring." "I've only Girdhar Gopal, no one else." "I've only Girdhar Gopal, no one else." "With tears..." "I've spread my love." "Now I got the reward of joy." "I've only Girdhar Gopal, no one else." "I've no friends or relatives." "I've no friends or relatives." "I've forsaken the maternal house..." "What can anyone do now?" "I've only Girdhar Gopal, no one else." "I've worn the veil of devotion." "I've worn the veil of devotion." "I've made garland of love." "I've only Girdhar Gopal, no one else." "I've only Girdhar Gopal, no one else." "With a crown of feather he looks alluring." "I've only Girdhar Gopal, no one else." "I've only Girdhar Gopal, no one else." This is voice of love and veneration... why is it caged in king's court? There is only one such voice in India. I can fail to recognize it. King honored me by calling me to court. You would've been more honored... if king had left court... to join your veneration. Tell your king... by buying the voice... he can't buy God. You can't say that to my king. I'm saying it in front of the king. Marvelous! Marvelous! Accept this gift... on my behalf. You started buying and selling again. This isn't a price... but a gift. Offer it on the idol of God. Do you know what this is? This is Akar's necklace given to your wife in reward... for her good singing. Never before our family was mocked like this. I befriended Rathore to increase our honor... not to get disgraced. I went to get a daughter-in-law from that house. This woman has betrayed us. She had desecrated religion. We've to make decision about her. In front of the royal priest and scholars... I'll summon court of religion. Whatever punishment they decide... should be accepted by you. Even if it's death penalty. Human is incomplete. Human can't test a human. But religion... is the rule of the society. If anyone breaks that rule... he's a culprit of religion and society... and God. It's ethical sin. And social crime too. Brahmins! And subjects! King Bhojraj's wife... queen Meera is accused... breaking not one, but many rules. To discuss that... this religion court has been summoned. With God's wish... and subject's permission... I start the proceeding of this court. Read Meera's crimes to the subjects. The society rules have laid down norms... that wife should accept religion of her husband. Meera refused to accept the religion of her husband. Meera made relationships with other men... they weren't from her in law's family... nor from maternal house. She mingled with people of low caste... and destroyed the traditions of royal family. Meera tried to burnt Krishna temple... which was closed by royal decree. Without husband's permission... Meera left her husband's house... and stayed out for more than one day. Besides Rana Bhojraj... Meera considers someone else her husband too. As per the religion... it's a sin for any woman. From the main enemy of king and subject... and the nation... King Akbar, Meera accepted gifts. He was the reason for her own brother Jaimal's death. Meera. You refused to accept the religion of your husband. I'm asking you. Did you refuse to accept your husband's religion? Why don't you answer? - Mahant is asking... - Uda. This isn't your family problem. This is about religion and justice. Meera... your silence... will be confession of crime. I give you one more chance to defend yourself. Did you refuse to accept your husband's religion? My religion is one. - World is like an ocean. - Meera. This isn't the time for poems. Answer the question. My religion is one. World is like an ocean. Do you accept... that you've other husband besides prince Bhojraj. One with crown of feather... he's my husband. The court should accept... that you've two husbands, not one. I've only Girdhar Gopal... nobody else. As a wife, what's your duty towards your husband? Do you know that? Can you give your husband a child? You'd surely know this duty of a wife? I'm soul... not body. I'm feeling... not view of a society. I'm a lover... beloved... a mendicant for love. I'm not a link of relationship. I'm not tied to any family. You get food from your family to live. Don't you've any duty towards them? - And these clothes? - Clothes are for body, sir. Body isn't for clothes. The way clothes isn't more important than body... body can't be more important than soul. The family that sustains you... and the society in which you live... don't their rules mean anything to you? Today... right now... I forsake my family and your society. I'm sorry, Meera... that I've been appointed for make decision. As the royal priest... Saint Raidas is my priest... not you... What other knowledge could you get from the man of low caste? Your sacrifice hides deception to avoid society and duties. Your love... seems to be full of lust. Or else for many days... you wouldn't have stayed with other men outside the house. You've disgraced the royal family. You've misled the subject. Rana, without any thoughts... could've given you death penalty. But it's my greatness... that I'm giving you a chance to explain. Because my religion... still gives more important to penance... and forgiveness than punishment. Anger makes us insane, sir. Don't be angry. You think of your religion. I'll do my duty. I'm not scared of death. If this body which binds me dies... then I'll get free. I'll get salvation. You're tied by consequence. But I... know the consequence of wish. - My duty... - Don't teach me scriptures. This isn't era of deties. Are you creating another scriptures. God's scripture is one. God too is one. My Krishna! Your Krishna! He's not only yours. We'll complete the proceedings tomorrow. Take Meera to dungeon again. - You are back from the battle? - Yes. I came back to face this conflict. You are hurt? It is nothing compared to the hurt you have given me. - Ask for forgiveness. - But what is my fault? If you'll ask for forgiveness, brother will forgive you. You don't know that it is Been decided to give you a death penalty. You'll have to consume poison in everybody's presence. Meera, run away. Go to Dwarka, nobody can do anything to you then. Why have you become so weak? My Rana is a Rajput. This doesn't befit my Rana. The Prince is unwell and thus, won't be able to attend court. What has happened to him? What has happened to him? Are you really concerned for Bhojraj? If you stay together, you feel concerned for your neighbors also. So won't I feel concerned for him with whom I stayed for so long? Amongst your family, who else are you concerned about? I'm concerned for you too, whom I've given lot of agony, priest. Silence! You are concerned about people whom you want to desert? The concern is for love, not the family. Nothing can lessen my love. Meera, you are obsessed and our law forbids from punishing the crazy. It treats them. Can you treat love? Silence! This is the court not a theatre. All are requested to maintain silence. Meera, you are accused of being a traitor. You accepted a gift from Emperor Akbar, the country's sworn enemy. - I've no enemies. - Isn't your country's enemy your enemy? For you, your country is limited to where your power ends. Your domain increases or decreases. I don't accept your parameters as my country. You don't accept Akbar as your enemy, who killed your brother... and who injured your husband? Politics is the King's domain, not mine. It is my duty to mete out justice. And it is my duty to punish the guilty. I'm not asking you not to fulfill your duty. Do you know your punishment? We both know the punishment. I free you from the sin of killing me. The court will give the verdict tomorrow. Come in. Take this key and free Meera from prison. Jashwant, who brought you here will see you to the gates. Lalita, take. Time is running out. - How will you face court? - Stop sermonizing to me. Go! Go from here. You cannot say anything. You are also afraid of Meera. I'm also feeling that halo. And can't hold her gaze. I am helpless. I can't bear this. My eyes are closing and falling a sleep I... can't see anything. I'm drowning. Lalita, you may go. The court and its subjects are witness... to the verdict on Rana Bhojraj's wife Queen Meera. As per the scriptures and society norms... Meera has been proved guilty. It has been proved that she violated the laws... ignored the royal honor and flouted family ties. The court has decided on a death penalty for all her crimes. The court orders Meera to drink a goblet of poison... in the presence of the court. God bless you! Respected upholders of the law and those present in the court... I'm feeling sorry to give this news that... the King of Menta became a martyr at the hands of the enemy. Meera was their only remembrance. I request the court... to be compassionate towards her. The law doesn't only want to finish crime. But it's duty is to create trust also. We'll give her one more chance. If she accepts her husband's religion... and asks for forgiveness... then the court will reconsider its decision. Meera, you have time to rethink till the gong strikes three times. Wait! Let me talk to her in private just once. Meera, just once... Don't you know not to call back when one goes to the warfront. I'm walking on my path of truth so don't call me back. "I am lovelorn." "But nobody understands my anguish." "I am lovelorn." "But nobody understands my anguish." "I am lovelorn." "The path of love..." "Is strewn with thorns." "Love is..." Sublime "I am lovelorn!" "But nobody understands my anguish." "I am lovelorn!" "I am lovelorn!" "I am lovelorn!" "But nobody understands my anguish." "But nobody understands my anguish."
