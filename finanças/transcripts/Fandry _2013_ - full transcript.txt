Pig There you are, you. You haven't finished working. Where were you? At Pirya, for the tomorrow homework. Fiches duty. Who will help me dig? I have already missed 3 days of school. An extra day, it won't hurt you. Now, file. Mom, I won't go to work tomorrow. I'm already late in class. Your father needs you, tomorrow. And you can buy yourself clothes. Frankly? You already said that the last time. - Are you kidding! - See that with your father. And stop bothering me. Shalu. Piraji, your friend is here. Come in. He doesn't feel well, he has been sleeping for 2 days. You neither, didn't go to school. I was counting on you for the homework. Ask Kulkarni, after that you will tell me. Today... I went to the woods. I saw the Black Sparrow. This bird of misfortune not stay in one place. It flies in all directions. I chased it for hours. But without success. We will surely find one near the haunted tombs. We will go when I get better. Here. Get up and have some tea. Is Vedant here? Vedant! The son of untouchable is here. Hey Vedant, pass me the remote control. Hi, Jabya. What is homework for tomorrow? Two lessons from English. The poem from Saint Chokhamela. And we have to finish the assignment. You finished it, you? That's all. - Who is here? - Do not worry, it's me. It's late! What's this fuss? I need gas. To do what? Go back to bed. Hurry up, Jabya. You don't have time. Wait a second. Hurry up! The poor boy is waiting for you. - What can I do? - The poor child. Thank God, you don't have a clear skin. - Are they my hair? - Yes. You're more manic than a movie star. Pirya, you think this belongs to the Black Sparrow? No. Too big. It's more like a pigeon feather. No, I think this is coming from the Black Sparrow. I am not sure that this feather suffices. No idea. No. It's a pigeon feather, It's certain. Jabya, another bird, do you think that will be okay? No, it doesn't work like that with the Black Sparrow. It's difficult. [CYCLE STORE CARROM HOUSE] Hurry up! It's yours. It's mine? Find a hold. The plateau is wobbly. Pass me the rubber. Here. Its good? - Get up. - Hold on! - I won't have red. - Why? I have my trembling hand. I'm getting nervous. If you don't take it, he will have it. Try it. As usual. I warned you that I won't have it. Jabya. - Don't you have school? - Of course, yes. So, you should go there. - Vedant Ramakrishna Kulkarni? - Present. - Jambuwant Kacharu Mane? - Present. Who hasn't done their homework? Yes, Mr. Patil? Your studies aren't your priority? ♪ Marriage of God Khandoba ♪ - Can I express myself? - Yes, of course. Respected Mr. Sangram. You don't need to study? Your father wins pretty well in his life. Try to bring me back your father tomorrow. Sit down. Sir, I'm going to sit in the back. Stay there! What's happening? He calls me nabot. Hey, scoundrel! Why are you making fun of him? I didn't laugh, Sir. He's talking bullshit. I will slap you if you do it again. He's typing me if I touch it. Alright, go sit down at the back. Saint Chokhamela. A verse from Saint Chokhamela. Things aren't same when they seem. We will study this poem, today. Appearances, caste or religion don't reflect a personality. Their qualities will reflect it. The saint explains it well in his poem using various examples. He uses a series of prose sentences. We will study them. It's a beautiful poem. We'll begin from the beginning. The juice of sugar cane doesn't look like the plant. But we judge things based on their appearance. The arc is curved, but not the arrow. But we judge things based on their appearance. Let's learn now the saint's poem. Mane, your mother is here. The river meanders but not its waters. But we judge things based on their appearance. Chokha, himself, is an untouchable. Look here. What are you laughing about? Chokha is untouchable, but not his feelings. But we judge things based on their appearance. Different examples and perspectives are used by the saint to explain the importance of values and virtues. A sugar cane is curved, but it's juice too? In the same way, the bow is curved, but doesn't he shoot straight arrows? Why did you come to school? To learn. I want to be educated and have a job. Mother! - Why is he screaming? - It's nothing. I was collecting wood around the school. I went to see him in the class. If you come back, I won't go to school. No, your majesty. Promised, I won't come anymore. You didn't go to Mumbai to see the cricket matches? I'm going there next week. It seems that women in there, they do massages. It's wrong. If you want to soothe your body, go to Mumbai. For my head, it's you I come to see. - You are too funny. - The farm. Hey Kachrya? Pigs become troublesome. My knee hurts me. - I can't run. - It's boring. - They annoy us seriously. - That is true. Ghorpade was bitten at the buttock. Try to get rid of it. - When was he bitten? - When he relieved himself. - Catch her. - Catch her. Which notebook am I going to ask?? Anything. How important is it? Will she give it to me? - Hey, wait. - Come on. - Wait. - Back. - Hold on. - What... - It's mine. - Wait. - Get up! - Do not touch her. The pig touched her. You got hurt? Get up. Sir, may I come in? - Enter. - Come. Come in, Rani. Sir, can I take her back? What happened? A pig touched her. Why are you playing with pigs? It's the pig that attacked her. Wash your feet to the head. I'm going to water your clothes with cow urine to purify them. Water me too. What are you doing up there? - Why are you destroying the nest? - That's not we are doing. I am checking that is it one of the Black Sparrow. What can it do! Come down. This bird is as a Brahmin. If you touch it, others will ban it. They will kill you. Come down. What are you looking at? Do you want a lesson? Come down. - Jabya, what are you doing? - Going down. Jabya, how do I do to get down? Just do the opposite way. - I am dizzy. - Jumped up. You think? - Wait for me, Jabya. - Come down or stay up there. Sir. - Hold. - Yes. Yes, Kachru? What's this meeting for? For the village festival. It's coming. Mom. We had the pay? Mom. Yes, we got it. A claimant will come to see Surkhi. We'll buy you some pants at the village festival. You already said that before Diwali. - We'll buy you some pants. - He adds some. Grandpa, what do you know about the Black Sparrow? The Black Sparrow? The bird that doesn't hold in one place. It flies everywhere. It's tail looks like a kite. I probably saw it. What's special about it? Nothing. What do you know about it? Son, I don't understand what are you talking about? Just tell me directly. What will happen when we burn it? What do you mean? It becomes ashes. What else? Give me that. Mom, she took my sunglasses. Don't make fuss. Give it to me. Did you read the book? Yes. Here it is. Unbelievable! The Art of Hypnosis. You read it? - Hey. - Jabya! Is it you, Jabya? Come here. - Come here. - Go see what he wants. The piglet is stuck. Get it out of here. I'm asking you to get it out. I won't do it. Listen to me, boy! What does he think about him? Any problem, Jabya? What's going on? Go quickly! Get out! What is it? Get out. Or I dig your grave. Hey, Kachrya! Hey, Kachrya!! Don't you hear me? Are you deaf or what? Mr. Patil asks you to come to his place. Idiot! Who throws stones over my chickens? Take that away from here. I will take it to my home. Your son has a big head. He was insolent. He is not like you. It is dishonorable. He's just a kid. If he was married, he could be a father. Kachrya empties the sewage - and clean the tank. - Yes. Here you are again? Did you hang around enough? Why did you disobey to Mr. Patil? Don't be rude with people. I don't want to be banned. Don't strut like a rich kid. The guests are here. Welcome! Welcome!! Take some water. What do you say? Speak Marathi, we want to understand. I said we have some difficulties, but thanks to Heaven, we are getting there. I have two daughters and a son. Are you going to school? Yes, I'm in fifth. The children are ashamed to speak their language. I have to talk to them Marathi, even at home. We are the only ones untouchable in this village. There are pigs here... - Hold it. - We do not raise them. Everything is ready? Cover your head. - Is she ready? - In a minute. Go ahead. What's your name? - Surekha. - Your full name. Surekha Kachru Mane. - Where do you come from? - From here. That's it to say? Tell them the name from our village. Akolner. You do not know it? Tell them it's Akolner. Of course she knows it. She is a little nervous. Don't be nervous. Speak boldly! Akolner. You have questions? Looks good, Vilas. You won't complain later. Go back inside. A tea? - Hold. - Please. Sit. A dowry of Rs. 50,000 then a ring worth of 10 grams of gold. You will finance the wedding. - Does that suit you? - Yes. I ain't so easy to afford, Sir. What do you propose? You can express yourself. I don't know what to say. We are listening to you. We will tell you if we accept. It doesn't cost anything to talk. I am poor. The life of my elder daughter is already ruined. We aspired to give better for my younger daughter. A dowry of 20,000 and I will do as much as for the wedding. Is it acceptable? We accept. Let's start the rituals. Listen to all. We crush the areca nuts? - Go for it. - Yes. The piglet is trapped. Let it go. - Don't touch her! - Jabya. A pig touched her. Jabya. Don't touch her. Free it and let it go. - A pig touched her. - Jabya. Damn bird! This bird has thrown us a type. That's why we didn't catch the Black Sparrow. What can there be?

You will have it this time. Listen to all. My friends! Let's increase a little participation. Let's go to Rs. 100 instead of Rs. 50. These Rs. 100 are mandatory. - Of course. - It must. Everyone pays, without exception. The toilet working people have fallen behind. We will be able to use their participation. The tea is ready? - Yes. - Quick. Kachru, serve tea. Give him. Jabya, help your father for a few days. Impossible, I will have my exams soon. You can buy yourself trousers. He wants jeans. He will be able to buy what he wants. It is very expensive. Who is there? You are stealing my wood? - That rascal is back. - Hey! Stop stealing. This isn't your father's home. It bores us that one. Quick, gather the wood. - Hey, you don't... - Let's go. I warned you.

We must catch the Black Sparrow. Why can't we do it? It's a wonderful bird. Come on, let's go home. I have ice cream for sale. Can I come with you? Of course. Where are we going to sell them? In the village, of course. Not in ours. Can we sell them elsewhere? Of course. Go! Quick! The Sparrow. Ice cream! Who wants ice cream? Ice cream! Buy my ice cream! Buy my ice cream!! Hey, stop yourself. Ice cream! Buy my ice cream!! Jabya. You have two free days. You will go with your father. I don't want. I will give you two days salary. Will you pay me? How? He sells ice cream. How much did you earn yourself? It doesn't concern you. You will have two days pay. How is it? I will buy jeans with the rest. Jeans, my foot! Can I have an advance? Impossible, I don't even have a work to offer you. Cane sugar sells at a good price. - How much did you sell? - About 5 tons. It must be a celebration. You surprise me. Kachru. Sir, can you lend me Rs. 5,000? Your timing is perfect. Give me a hundred rupees. - There is at least 1000 rupees. - Thank you sir! - And then this examination? - The one of geometry? She's looking at you. I'm sure, she's looking at you. Come. We will go ourselves on the other side. What makes you nervous? You are talking about me? Even a blind man would realize it. She really looks at me? We will get behind. Let's see if she turns around. It was nice, no? - Only one? - Of course. What did he say? Get up, tanned. I already told you not to come here. - Don't call me like that. - And what will you do? You don't deserve to be here. How dare you to watch Shalu! If you do it again, you're screwed! Disappear!

Why don't we arrive early to catch that bird? It's been days. It's really not easy. If only we had a weapon. If only. Slim. It must be past noon. Pirya, you like Rani, not true? - Not at all. - On your mother's head? I swear, I don't like her. Who is roaming around her? It has nothing to do. What is wrong with you all day, then? - You know? - What? Sangram and Shalu found themselves in secret on the terrace. You, don't worry. It was Vedant who said it. Sangram may have asked to Vedant to spread the rumor. He looks stupid but he is clever. Who is it? Hanya's grandma had hiccups. This isn't serious. So much so that it took bing him to the hospital. She's a niggard. Here's another one. He is drunk. Leave it alone. - Not today. - He's too drunk. Let him go. Hey Kachrya! Did you get drunk at the picket? Who is in interest of what am I worth? Go home, Kachrya. Go back. Go to bed. - At the picket! - There you go. At the picket! At the picket! At the picket!! - At the picket!! - Oh dear. - Bravo, Kachrya! - Go! What a failure! He got drunk at the piquette. Shall I serve you dinner? Needless. What is it? I saw your brother. He can't lend me the money. He promised to help. Money for the dowry. How we are going to do this? Pirya, wait. Look for the Black Sparrow. It's too expensive. Excuse me. - Do you sell sparrows? - Yes, see you later. - Do you have a black one? - A Black Sparrow? With a tail like a shape of kite. Mine aren't like that. Jabya. Look at these fish. He doesn't have a Black Sparrow. No chance. I must. It's clear. This isn't your bike? Hey, driver, look behind you. We should better go from here. Forget that. Don't cry. Take him with you. - Hail, Ram! Ram!! - Hail, Ram! Ram!! Do you have any work for me? Not at this moment. Call me, if you needed. No problem. Okay? Tell me... - Can I have that manure? - Yes. You owe me another Rs. 100. Can I pay later? Okay. Jabya. Did you get the Black Sparrow? How much can I have for the bike? About Rs. 200. What is it? Why are you crying? Good. Shalu sent you to graze? Her father discovered it? Yours? So why are you crying? A truck crashed my bike and ice cream. What? It is not serious. Don't repay me. Why are you crying? Get up. Don't repay me. Idiot! Take a seat. We are going to play. Did you find the Black Sparrow? No, but I found a feather. It doesn't work. We need the Sparrow. That is true? Don't you believe it? - Yes. - It works if you believe it. - How many? - Rs. 10. What are you doing here? Your mother doesn't feel well. Go to the market, replace it. Come on stand up! Go.. Go.. Go... - What's up? - Nothing special. Why are you hanging out with this good-for-nothing Chankya? He is a scum. He has scammed the cleverest. If I see you again with him, I'll break your legs. Go to the market. Send your mother home. Fifty paisa for the candies. Do not get scammed. Buy my sweets. They are good. They are worth 50 paisa. Don't buy them for 1 rupee. Sir, buy my candy. How much for the basket? - Hundred rupees. - Hundred? It is very expensive. - I'll give you sixty. - No. Sixty is good. The equipment already costs 200 rupees. Seventy? Make an effort. Seventy, that's okay. Never mind. Where did he go? Where is this boy? Surely gone looking for some water. He was right there. Baskets for sale. Excuse me, madam. You want this basket? A beautiful wedding. The village festival starts tomorrow. I know. This will be the opportunity to launch ashes to Shalu. - I don't know. - Nobody will know anything. I know. Pirya, my father told me not to hang out with Chankya. They take it all for an original. Do you think Chankya is right? We can hypnotize someone with Moineau's ashes? Who knows? Look, you knew that the Chankya wife was beautiful? How such a pretty girl could have fallen in love with him? She is from of a Pune family. One day her brother abducted her. They reduced Chankya to mush. From that point, he began to drink. Whatever you say, Pirya. Chankya is an extraordinary guy. He would not lie to me. He refused the money that I owed him. He told me that I looked like him. Chankya likes you. Dear Shalu, I do not know why I love you so much. I may not be handsome. Don't leave hanging your Business. Here. Look, I have new clothes. Do you like them? You still have to iron your pants. Hurry up. Here you are at last. You will go back there. Listen to me. Buy rope for 50 rupees. We must go to the temple. Why don't we go later? Praised be the carriage of God! My Dear Shalu, I don't have the words to express how much I love you. I know I'm poor and from another caste than you. But honestly, nobody loves you so much, like I love you. Not even your parents. I'm ready for anything to win your love. A word from you and I would be ready to sacrifice myself. I swear by you. I think of you night and day. You can believe me. Shalu, if you don't love me, rips this letter and throw it away. I'll accept it. But don't talk about it to your parents. Don't show it to anyone and don't bother about me. And if you love me too, answer this letter. Or when you come at school tomorrow, make two mats. I will understand that you love me back. I'm waiting for your answer with impatience. I'm all yours, Jambuwant. Go, file, you. Move, niggas. - You heard? - I am going. Get away, niggas! Shit! Get out! Two ice creams. We'll buy you a shirt. We'll buy you the pants later. Don't bother. Come on, Pirya. Come. Come on, Son. Let's go. Good. Give it to me. - Yes, Kachrya? - A shirt for the boy. - Show me the cheapest. - Okay. About 150 rupees. Please. Which one do you prefer? - This one? - It looks better for you? You take another one? Here is a nice shirt. Looks like you're leaving on a mission. Where are you going? We came to see you. You could lend me your drum for the procession? Drums of Kem didn't play well already? - Yes. - Yes, you can have it. But we must play well. You must insure! You will see. You'll have it. Go ahead. I'm joining you. - Are you really coming? - I'm coming very soon. [SALE OF SPIRITS] We aren't ready to see him again. He looks... That is true. Praised be the carriage of God! Praised be the carriage of God! Jabya, you have to dance and impress Shalu. Jabya. The cart fell. Fucking pig! He brushed my leg! Go quickly. Get up! It's a bad omen. I know. Never mind. Don't make fuss. Send me, Kachrya. Continue the procession. You know what happened at the procession? - No sir. - A pig has made havoc. It struck the chariot of God. Get rid of those filthy pigs tomorrow. My daughter is getting married in two days. Two days? It's not a problem. We have a wrestling tournament tomorrow. Kill the pigs before it causes another trouble. Alone, it's impossible. I beg you, Kachrya. Take your wife and your children with you. Take money from the budget of the party, if necessary. Here. Kill the pigs before people go to relieve themselves. Or they will cause further trouble. Jabya. Jabya! Jabya!! Wake up! Wake up!! Wake up!! Show me. Henna looks darker. Put oil on it to darken well.
