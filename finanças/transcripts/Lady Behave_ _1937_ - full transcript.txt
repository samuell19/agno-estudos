[cheering] [honking] We'll be right out. Hurry up, Clarice. The horses are frothing out there. Well, snap it up, Paula. Hold still, baby. Well, we're going to be late. She never goes to Mardis Gras. She squirts seltzer bottles. Watch her. And another thing, young man,be sure that she's home by 2:00. Remember, we're sailing in the morning. You just leave her to me, Mrs. Kendall. Mrs. Kendall. [laughter] We're sisters. It's worrying that gives her that motherly look. Now, behave yourself orI'll come along as chaperone. Well, why don't you, Paula? Go ahead, Paula. If you swing on a chandelieronce in your life, maybe you'd forget this trip to the islands. Oh, don't be silly, Burton. I've got my work to do. Oh, Paula. -Good bye, good bye. -Mm. Me too. Oh, no. Thank you. -Good bye. Good bye. [LAUGHING] Crazy youngsters. As one old grey beard to another, what do you do for your rheumatism? Burton, you came hereonly to settle my business. As your godfather, I have some rights. And you worry me, Paula. We'll stick to business. All right. All right. Here's the bill of sale forthe house and furnishings. Sign here and here. Yes. Oh, by the way, will this forwarding address reach you all right? Just Ms. Paula Kendall, care of American Medical Research Haiti? Yes, that'll reach me. Over and above travelingexpenses, you have 5,000 left. I'll draw on that if I need it. [laughter] Oh. Well. Who's the lady? Oh, that's my little Paula. And Paula, this is, uh-- what's your name? McMasters. I never heard of you. Stop it. Stop it. It's time you two were in bed. Why, Paula. Oh, uh-- well, I didn't mean-- come here. Come here. Now, you'll just have to go. That's all there is to it, mister. Please. Well, where'd the man go? I liked man. [whistling] Where's the nice man? Oh, Clarice. [whistling] Come on, nice man. Come on. What is it with me, Paula? Every time I meet a niceman, poof, he disappears. Now, Clarice, where have you been? Look, I brought you something, see. Thank you. Now baby, are you sure youdidn't get in any trouble? Oh, no no. No trouble. First, we all went to the Ogle--we all went to the Oglethorpe for supper. Yes. And then we got to dancingat the Belle Tavern, and then we got married, andthen we all want for breakfast, and-- -What did you say? And then we all went for breakfast. No, before that. We got married. Oh, Clarice, you are married. I know, right before breakfast. Clarice, you were marriedsix months ago in New York. Don't you remember Mr. Michael Andrews? Where-- where is Mike? I want to talk to Mike. I'm taking you out on the country to get you away from him. Now you sit up here. You know, all this yelling ain't helping me get to sleep any faster. Paula, I'm tired. Oh, Clarice, this is bigamy. Was it that, uh, that Mr. McMasters? Mr. McWhat-- oh, no, no. Well, who was it? Who do you think? Who do you think, Paula? A millionaire. A millionaire. Clarice. Oh, Clarice. Oh dear. Oh. Mr. Williams, please. Burton. Paula. What can they do to a bigamist? A bigamist. Well, can they send her to jail? Not more than 10 years? Oh, Burton, you've got tocome over here right away. Well, it's just around the corner. Can't you run? Rush. Hurry. Oh. Ms. Kendall, please. I'm Ms. Kendall. Indeed. You look surprisingly well for the morning after a Mardis Gras. What's that? I beg your pardon. My name's Howell. I represent the man you married last night. I'm afraid there must be some mistake. Exactly the way I feel about it. That's why I'm here. Oh, Mr. Howell, please take this chair. . Thank you. Uh, where is that, uh,Mr. um-- what is his name? Your husband's name, younglady, is Stephen Cormack. You don't mean Stephen D. Cormack. Stephen Dorchester Cormack. He left an hour ago onhis yacht for Valparaiso. Oh, but he can't. I've got to talk to him. Doesn't he realize what happened? I'm here to handle the matter for him. Oh, but you can't. He's the only one that can do anything. Ms. Kendall, I've been handling Mr. Cormack's mistakes for years,ever since his wife died. I believe I'm competent. In the case of the usual broken heart, I'm accustomed to paying $3,000. Since this is managed,I'm willing to go to five. You can have your check immediately, and I'll handle the divorce.-Divorce. Why yes. We're ready to let you sueon the grounds of desertion. We believe that would be the fairest way to handle the matter. All right. [phone rings] Excuse me. [sleepy moaning] Burton, this is Mr. Howell. He's ready to arrange a divorce. How dare you. -How dare I what? -Burton. You don't know who you'redealing with, my man. Ms. Kendall is a lady. She married her husband because she loves him. Didn't you? Well, you know perfectly well that I-- Why, of course I do. What do you mean by tryingto buy her good name, to break up her marriage? Why it's insulting. If I were 20 years younger-- Burton, stop it. You know this is the only way out. No, my dear. I can't allow you to sacrifice yourself. I have a feeling-- Please. I have nothing more to say to you. Well, that's a relief. You have my offer. When you wills see me againwithout this belligerent little gentleman, I shall be waiting at the ambassador, Ms. Kendall. Mrs. Cormack. Well, now you've done it. Haven't I. And just in the nick of time. Did he see Clarice? -No. Then give me a hand. We've got to get her out of here. Burton, have you gone mad? Howell is ready to give us a divorce. Not if I can help it. Suing for divorce is the surest way of sending Clarice to prison. Why? Clarice has committed a crime. She's married two men-- one, two. We can't touch last night'smarriage because that would show her to be a bigamist, and off she'd go for 10 long years. So what can we do? Get hold of husband numberone, Michael Andrews. We've got to get that marriageannulled, do you understand? Well, I'm beginning to. Then help me get her onher feet, down to the boat, and out of the country. Burton, she can't leave the country. Howell will get suspicious. No. That's out only piece of luck. He thinks you're the one that married Cormack. You stay behind. Oh. Burton, you're not asking meto act as that man's wife? You'll have to. I can't. I don't know how. Well, it won't take any experience, Paula. He's out of the country. You'll never see him. Well, even so, I-- oh, I-- Do you want to see this child go to jail? No. Well, then get her bags. Call a taxi. Oh, I think that this is-- Mister, if you don't stop flirting with me, I'm going to call the cops. Oh, no cop. I'll get a taxi. You remember Uncle Burton, don't you? No. [ship horn blowing] Now, my dear-- Well, she's gone. For the time being, she's safe. Now who are you? Why, I'm-- You're Clarice. You're very gay. You're going to dress like her. Come now, what else? Well, I'm going to call Mr. Howell, and I'm going to tell him I'm ready to take my place in a Cormackhome and be a model wife. You're going to doeverything you can to prevent them from starting a divorce. That would be fatal. Yes, but how far is Valparaiso. Now, don't worry about Cormack. Before he even thinks of returning, I'll get hold of Andrews,and we'll have our annulment. Yes, but are you sure that--you're positive you can get it? For any one of a number of good reasons. Andrews may be slightly colored or insane. But he isn't. Well, then we'll pay him to write a letter that will serve as evidence that the marriage was a fraud. That doesn't sound quite within the law. Well, it isn't. Neither is posing as Mrs. Cormack, but that's just what you're going to do. Oh. Now, Paula, make that call. Burton, you're a very dishonest old gentleman. Paula, you're practicallyan adventuress. Oh, dear. Ambassador Hotel. [phone ringing] Yes, Ms. Kendall? I beg your pardon-- Mrs. Cormack. Are you ready to accept my proposition? I insist on taking myposition as Mrs. Cormack. You intend to take up your residence in the Long Island home? Very well, then let me tell you something. No. How many? Nevertheless, when you'reready to take me home, I'm ready to go. Atta girl, Paula. I'm the mother of two children. Alfred. Oh. The children I was telling you about. Patricia, Henry, this is your new mother. How do you do? We're going to be good friends, aren't we? [IN UNISON] No. Well, uh-- oh. Alfred, What is this? Oh, uh, excuse me, sir, but wewere just preparing a reception for Mrs. Cormack, so to speak. Oh, please don't bother. I don't want you to make a fuss over me. No, ma'am. We won't. That's right. I just want to take things as they come. No, ma'am. We won't like to do that either. We're not going to let you take a thing. So you can get right out and start looking for some otherpoor old man to befuddle. What's that? Try moving in with someone elseand move out with his bankroll, but you won't do it here. Why you-- Oh. Oh. Here we are. Blackjack-- in my opinion the finest two-year-old in the country. I don't want your opinion on horses. I want your help for Clarice. Let's stick to the point. I'm right on the point, Mr. Williams. You see, this year, Blackjack will be carrying all the smart money of which, uh, personally I haven't any. Oh. Pardon me. We're perfectly willing to pay you. $1,000? Pardon you? I adore you. It's going to be apleasure to help Clarice. Now, uh, what was it you wanted me to do? Just write that letter. Date it before your marriage. Tell her you're a duke and willing to throw your entire fortune at her feet. Hmm. Funny, I might have toldher that very thing, too. By the way, who would you say she married? Stephen Cormack. D? D. And they've accepted hersister Paula into [inaudible]? --count on that much longer. The children resent her. They'd do anything toget her out of the house. Why, It's going to be a greatpleasure to help Clarice. [humming] But Duke, what about the letter? I'm going to get Paula a letter personally. But the money's right here. You want to bet on that horse, don't you? Bet on it, Mr. Williams? I'm going to buy it. I beg your pardon. I would like to see MasterHenry and Mistress Patricia, please. Hello. Do you mean us? I do. May I see in private, please? Sure. Come on in. Never mind. I won't be long. Michael D-- Demetri. Andrews. I've come to warn you. What? You have a leech in thishouse, a python, a scorpion. You from the exterminating company? Of course not. I'm talking about thatwoman your father married. She's [inaudible]. Before she wrecks yourlife as she wrecked mine, get rid of her. Good day. Hey, wait a minute. One second. Do you know her? Know her? Why, she was dazzled by me. She followed me to the Alps, to the Riviera, to the Monte Carlo. Uh, she would still be following me-- No. You mean it? But she took very penny I had. She'll be ruining you, too. Get rid of her. Good day. Don't go. Look, we can't get rid ofher, but you can help us, Mr. Andrews. You said she followed you. If I wished it, one snap of my fingers and she'd come running like a little poodle. Would you consider, uh, snappingher just to help us out? I never wish to see that lady again. Good day. We're willing to pay you. What's that? Don't be offended, Mr. Andrews. He didn't mean it. Well, I just thought he mightget her out of the house. We couldn't expect him todo it for nothing, could we? I could never do such a thing for pay. No, of course not. Certainly not. I would do it only for revengeand perhaps to get back what the lady took from me. We'll give it to you. Every penny of it. The $30,000, my dearchildren, they are the least. $30,000. I don't think we could give you that much. Young man, same with me. I don't think I could ever face her again. Good day. Oh, uh, well, uh, we'll get the money. That is, if you're sure you can dazzle her. Is she different from any other woman? I dazzle them all. No. Pat, do you feel it? Huh, yes, I think I do a little. But don't go by me. We can go by the lady herself. Just tell her that MichaelDemetri Andrews is here. She'll rush down, and I'll giveyou whatever proof you want. If you'd hold her hand, that'd be something. I shall hold the lady's hand. And pinch her cheek. Um, would you sort of put your arm around her and whisper in her ear? I shall even kiss the tipsof her fingers, all five of them-- that is, if it's a deal. It's a deal. If you can do it, we'll get the money. Send for her. Uh, Alfred. Yes, sir. Oh, uh, there's a Mr.Michael Demetri Andrews-- I understand, sir. Hmm. Is there somewhere you can watch? In the dining room, sir. Oh, I-- I beg your pardon. He's right. Come on and we'll show you. Mr. Andrews, if you'vecome to give me the letter, where is it? Mr. Andrews, you promised me that letter. You need $30,000 to buy a horse? It's an out and out steal. Well, Mr. Andrews, what hasClarice got to do with a horse? I won't let you swindle those children. [stammering] They're watching us from the dining room. I don't care. I won't let you swindle those children. If you do as I tell you, I'll get my horse, you'll get the letter, thekids will get rid of you. I won't do it. Oh. You won't do it, thenClarice will get 10 years. Oh. I'm smiling. -Uh-huh. That's better. That's much better. Now come on, loosen up. Well, was I convincing? It was elegant, but-- Oh, oh, a credit? No, it's just the money. There'll be a slight delay. Oh, don't let that worry you, my dear children. Just let me have half tonight. The rest can wait. Five or six years? You see, we'll have to payyou out of our allowance. I didn't ask for a pension. I leave you with your new mother. Oh-- oh-- I'm sick about this, Mr.Andrews, but we'll find a way. We'll do anything. PAULA: Why, Mr. Andrews, still here? Yes. We've introduced ourselves. And from what yourlittle daughter tells me, I'm afraid our dinner engagement is off. It's nothing, nothing serious. As long as little Patricia is so ill, I wouldn't consider takingher mother out of the house. I think she understands. Well, wait a second. Don't go. Mr. Andrews, conditions might improve. Mrs. Cormack, for the sake of us all. Now, children-- I'm sorry about that. Well, that's all right. Let's try being friends. If it's advice or sympathy youneed, or a shoulder to cry on, well, here it is. Thanks, lady, but you can keep your shoulder. Be a little more considerate, young man. I was just trying to help your sister. She's not feeling very well. You needn't bother. It's nothing money won't cure. Money? Money. Well, there are all sorts of ways of getting money if it's for a good cause. It's for a good cause, all right. A very, very good cause. A downright crusade, that's what. Well, then by all means, let me join up and I'll help you get it. Can you? If we Stick together. We'll stick closer'n gum, lady. That is, until we get the dough. Then it's simply a matterof liquidating your assets. Our what? Coats, furs, jewelry, cars. That's $10,123.32. Well, that's a start. What do you mean a start? We've sold everything we've got. Except a couple of old ginger ale bottles. What have you got to my oh my about? You haven't given up anything. I know, but-- well, I'm as worried as if I were in trouble myself. Haven't you any old emeralds or something? I'm afraid that-- If we had half that money by tonight, I know where I'll get the rest of it. You do? I'll look around, see if I can't find an emerald. Stop here, please. I'll get that money and be right home. If she gets that money, she won't have any home. If. All right, driver. Hey. Well? What happened? Well, I was walking down Fifth Avenue, and there in the gutter, what do you see? An emerald. No. Let's see. Wow. We ought to have thought of looking in the gutter Aw, she's only kidding, aren't you? Sure. She got this from Burton William. Who's he? Oh, um, he-- well, he's justa man over at the American Security Bank. I borrowed the money in your name. Gee, thanks misses-- er, thanks a lot, lady. That's all right. Were there any messages for me? No, I don't-- Sure. Mr. Andrews called. Everything's all right now. He's coming over to take you to dinner. Oh, I'd better rush. Good evening. Oh, hello. Come in. We want to see you. Ms. Patricia, I'm so happy to hear you've gotten over your illness. Every penny of it. 15,000, correct? Mr. Andrews, how long do youthink it will be before-- you know-- you snap your fingers? We didn't want to rush you any, but we can have the rest of themoney in two or three days. Two or three. Just let me see. Today, she's weakening,tomorrow she'll be anxious. Perfect. In three days, she'll be waiting to follow me to the end of the Earth. Hot diggity. Right on schedule. Yes, but what are you goingto do when you get her there? Drop her. Shh. Mr. Andrews, do your best to do your worst. The lady will come home completely dazzled. Ah. Dinner at the Ritz, the opera, and dancing at the Rainbow Room. Delightful. Shake. Not until she leaves for good, I won't. What chance has she got? Papa'll get our cable tonight,and in 24 hours, he'll be home and we'll have the rest of our money. Maybe. No maybe about it. Wait till he sees her withAndrews-- eating at the Ritz, going to the opera, dancingat the Rainbow Room, dazzled. Hello, George. Hello, Mr. Cormack. The car's right over here, sir. That's the boy. Steve. Hello, Pop. STEPHEN: Hello! Oh. Hello, Pat. Boy are we glad to see you. I'm glad to see you. Well, oh, wait a minute. What's all this affection? We've decided you're a man that needs help.

Stay on your toes. Yes, yes, of course. She'll be down in a jiffy. Thank you. Let me help you. She's fainted. As gracefully as Pavlova. Uh, that was before your time. She's really very lovely. That's a beautiful mouth,and those eyelashes. They're real. Well, aren't you going to do something? I should, shouldn't I. Get some help. Get some water. Easy with her now. Hurry up with that water. We've got to bring her to. Yes, by all means. I'd like to meet her. Say Steve, didn't you meether when you married her? Why yes, of course. But I met so many people that night, it was all a littlehasty and vague and hazy. Sounds like you got married in a fog. A high fog. They're bad in New Orleans. Hello. Hello. I'm Mr. Cormack. --Oh, I'm, uh, I'm-- Mrs. Cormack. Yes. How do you do? How do you do? Silly of me to faint like that. Oh, it was beautiful to watch. I liked your eyelashes. They flutter. I don't think I ever fluttered before. You know as little about yourself as I do. I'm afraid, well, maybe that's right. Well then let's bothfind out what you're like. We'll-- we'll go somewhere and have dinner maybe. She can't. She's got a date. Oh. Why, Patricia, what a silly notion. I planned to spend the evening at home. You were going to sit aroundall night with your coat on? Oh, it was chilly. That's probably why I fainted. I'd better go up and rest. Yes, of course you're tired. I'll tell you what, I'll order dinner and we'll have it togetherquietly in your room. We've got some important things for you to do. Since when do I have to do important things? Since we decided you're a helpless old man. Just forget that they ever said that. Go to bed. -What? What? Run along. You're growing children. We're Cormacks, and you saidwe got to stick together. Yes, I know. We'll stick together someother time, but not now. Go ahead. Remember, it's the hours before 12:00 that count. Steve, we got to talk to you alone. You don't know what's been-- Oh, oh, this is not time for talk. It's your homecoming. It calls for celebration. You're tired. -I'm fine. We'll celebrate. I'll dress. Won't be a minute. Uh, I want to speak to Mr. Andrews. We'd like to speak to Mr. Andrews, Mr. Michael Demetri Andrews. Of course it's the same man. Get off the line. Hello. I've got-- Get off the line, you. I've got to talk to Mr. Andrews We've got to talk to Mr. Andrews. But who wants to speak to Mr. Andrews? -I do. -We do. Now look, we've been waiting here for-- Will you please get off the line? But he's left the hotel. Good. He's on his way up here now. How long ago did he live? He left for Chicago. Chicago? Chicago. Oh no. Burton Williams, please. Oh, why must he be eatingat a time like this. Don't tell me he was hungry. Well, do you know where he went? What restaurant? Uh, have you the phone number? Do you know the address? Oh, uh, just a minute. Uh-- Fluttering and fainting. Why, she's got Steve half ruined already. He hasn't got our resistance. He's weak minded. One look at Andrews-- [kissing noises] Agh. It would give your fatherstrength unquestionably. But Andrews is gone. Oh, and there's my brother, Mark Logan, him that's a private detectivewith a mind to bring him back. Get Logan. And until he finds Andrews, it's up to us to keep Steve from falling. If we have to hold him up with our bare hands. That's right. Supervisor, I'm not trying to be difficult. I merely asked information--well, never mind. I'm not upsetting any plans you've made? No, no. Where should we dine? The Ritz? Waldorf? Oh, I'd prefer, uh, Lehman's Health Food and Vegetarian Lunch. Table for two. Roll your own, mister. Oh, thank you. Excuse me, ma'am. For a cup of coffee, could I tell you fine upstanding citizens one of the most remarkable incidents-- Oh no, please. Well, if you'd only bearwith me for a few moments-- Some other time. Burton, here he is. Well, uh, I guess shemeans me, Stephen Cormack. [coughing] Oh, dear, dear, dear. Don't, uh, don't let meinterrupt you, mister uh-- Burton Williams. Would you mind getting me something to eat? I'd like some steak, some potatoes, and some chicken, a littleturkey, some soup, and dessert. I'll, um-- I'll get a little of everything. Excuse me. Oh, Burton. Keep calm. You're doing fine. It's not how I'm doing. It's Andrews. He's disappeared. Now you keep calm, please. He can't do that. I'll find him. I'll get him and bring him back here. Don't you be afraid. Well, it's not Andrews I'm afraid of. Cormack? But eh thinks you're his wife. We haven't a thing to worry us. We? It'll only be for a week, a few days, maybe. Burton. Well, he won't know. I mean, you'll get used to it. You want me to get used to living in a house with a man who thinks he's my husband. No, no, that's impossible. Come on. Let I find out about Clarice. We'll run for it. Oh no, we can't. We can't. Well then what-- Burton, you've known me for a long time. Do you think I could take the chance? Well, you're as practical too. Yes, I am. I'm sensible and practical. Got a good level head on your shoulders. Yes, sir. Just hold tight. You'll win through. I'll hold tight. I'll win through. I'll do it. The chicken and turkey were made of spinach, so I bought hamburgers. They're made of vegetables. Well, nothing here is what it seems to be. Congratulations. Thank you. I've always hoped that some fine man would come along for this young lady. You're not going. Oh, I have my work to do. And after all, your husband is your job. Oh, Burton. Good bye. Oh, good bye. Good bye. Good bye, good bye. Thoughtful codger. Good night. Good night. Like some help? Oh, yes. It's, um-- if you couldshove this against there. Mm-hmm. That's easy. Like that? Yes, thank you. That'll do. For tonight. Good night. Good night. Well, darling, these three are my choice. It says the Isles of Greece are intoxicating, Old Normandy is quaint, andthe South Seas are glamorous. What do you think? I think Long Island is glamorous. Oh, but the place is infested with children. We can't be a realproper, respectable couple without a honeymoon. Oh. I-- I can't go on a honeymoon with you. Oh, well I can't very well go by myself. I'd be conspicuous. We can't leave here because your work. You've just settled out the plant, put new life in the whole organization. Well then, we'll combine business with pleasure. I'll put Cormack's patent leathers on every barefoot native we meet. Come on. What do you say? When do we leave? No. Why? Oh, just no. That's all. Well, is it-- Oh, please. No. Is it because we've only known each other a week? Hasn't that been long enough? It's been a lifetime, the kind of a life I never thought I'd live. And the kind of a life you don't like. Is that it? Oh, no. It's-- it's been exciting. It's been fun. It's been-- well, it's been happiness. Why can't we stretch thatweek into years forever? Why not? Now, just a minute. I'm the one that's asking the questions. Well, just this once, let me answer. I don't want to see the Isles of Greece. I want to see Old Normandy,the glamor of the South Seas, and I want to see them with you, and I'm going to say, no matter what happens. Nothing's going to happen. I won't let it. Mr. Cormack, you're a darling. Howell is expecting thesecontracts at the plant. Very good, sir. Hello, hello, hello. Well, what's the matter with you two? Feeling feverish? It's not us, Steve. We want to talk to you about her. Oh. You think she's pretty nice, don't you? Well, conservatively, I do. You've got to admit, she'sbeen the making of you, Pa. I am a different man. Well, the whole house is different. She's been swell, andshe's awfully pretty too. Well, I've been hoping this would happen. I haven't been any toogood a father since, well, these past few years. But now, this place is happy. Now it's a home. I feel-- I feel alive. We're all together again and she's responsible. It was pretty important that youlike her, and I'm glad you do. Yeah. I like her fine, but-- go on. Tell him, Hank. Well, I like her fine too, onlywe know a man who says that-- Yes. Well, he says he can lure her, sort of. He says he can run away withher to the ends of the Earth. Well, that's quite a statement isn't it? Who is he? A gentleman by the name of Andrews. All he has to do is snap his fingers and she comes running like a poodle. And he says if we canbe up at the Red Swan Inn by midnight tonight with $15,000, well, we'll never see her again. And you were going to getthis money and give it to him. We can't get it and youwouldn't want to give it to us, would you? Me? Not a cent. OK. We'll call the whole thing off. Of course. What are you worrying about now? Hmm? Oh, nothing, nothing. Not going through with it now, even if he does guarantee results. Sure. It isn't worth the money, even if she would have gone away with him. Yeah. I'd like to go on liking our lady, not even wondering if she would have. No. No, not even wonder. Yes, sir? Oh, um, oh Alfred, would you please ask Mrs. Cormack to come down? Certainly, sir. $15,000, a snap of the fingers. Heh. A fine pair of meddlers you turned out to be. Well, in the beginning, itwas just to save you from her. Why do you think I wanted to be saved? She's everything I've ever wanted. She's beautiful. She's gracious. She's honest. She's left, sir. Dear Mr. Cormack, please don't be offended of my leaving so suddenly. My aunt in Poughkeepsie is dangerously ill. No matter what happens, I like you very much. That's all. Heh. So no matter what happens to her aunt, she still likes me very much. Why, that makes everything all right. Sure. Here we are worrying, and all the time she's taking care of her aunt. I guess that Mr. Andrews isn'tas good as he thought he was. There you are. You can give that to your Mr. Andrews. You can finish the deal. Steve, what are you going to do? I'm going upstairs and laugh myself sick. Gee, I didn't think he'd take it that hard. You could've seen he likes her. Pop hasn't made a mistakesince she's been here, has he? No. Well-- well maybe we went a little too far. Don't say we. You ruined everything. Papa'll go into another fog again and maybe meet another lady. Yeah. And she might be a thousand times worse. Of course she will. She couldn't be any better. There won't be any other lady. This one's staying. I'm going to ask her myself personally. Won't do any good. Andrews will have her so fascinated, she mightn't even listen to you. Say, I can be pretty fascinating myself. [dinging bell] HANK: Hello. Where is everybody? What kind of a place is this anyhow? Hello, service. Where are you? Is everybody dead around here? Well, nobody died recent time,but I ain't promising nothing. Never mind that. Have you any word for us? Well, I'd say just bothersome. No, no. I'm Henry Cormack. Is there any message for me? No. No message for Patricia Cormack either? No, but I got a note here for Hank Cormack. Well, what is it? I'm Hank Cormack. Hey, no falsifying at register. Mr. Michael Demetri Andrewswants to know when you're going to arrive up in 703. Way up on the seventh floor? Shucks no. The first. [knocking] Come in. Mr. Andrews. Mr. Andrews. Hello. Patricia, boss. Is she here? Room 704 as per agreement, COD. Now look, Mr. Andrews, if it was too much trouble getting her here-- Think nothing of it, my boy. On an enterprise like this,I pour out my very soul. We don't want you to strainyourself any, Mr. Andrews. You have the check, no? No. The point is, Mr. Andrews,we're asking you please not to dazzle that lady anymore. Keep the money you've got. Only go away. The deal's off. Why, uh, you must bejoking, my dear children. This is no such deal. You must understand, you canstop the ocean waves from waving, you can stopNiagara Falls from falling, but you cannot stop this ladyfrom running away with me. Do you mean it? Well, of course, Patricia. Our deal must continue. Nothing doing. Let's get her out of here. Impossible, my dear boy. Well don't you make a move to stop us. I won't make any move. I'll stay right here like this. I'll do nothing but thinkand wish that she runs to me. She can't resist. She must run to me no matter what you do. Stop looking at him, Pat. I don't want any trouble with you. Oh, I didn't expect-- this is a surprise. How do you feel? Is there a tug, likesome power's pulling you? Why no. Oh, unless you mean Hank here. She doesn't feel it. We've still got a chance. Come on. You're in terrible trouble. Hey, Pat, come back here. Hey, Pat. It's all right, lady. Put those bags down. Give me my things. Put my things down. Now, I'm not leaving. I-- I can't. We understand, lady. It's that guy, Andrews. He's got you weak and helpless. It's the same with every woman he meets. It's not your fault. But now that we've settledwith him, you can come home, can't you?-You've settled with him? Uh-huh. We'll leave in a moment. Just let me go to my room. Watch her, Pat. It's Andrews. He's luring her back. Pat. Oh. Can't you steel yourself against that man? Please, until we get you out of the door? Let-- let me go. Ms. Cormack, I mean it. You've got to excuse us for doing this, lady, but it's for your own good. Grab her legs, Pat. I'll get her round the neck. Hank. Ha-- [inaudible]. Do you ever think she'll come out alone? You've got to give me that letter. Oh, you don't know how it feels. Oh, don't I? And how would Edison feel if he didn't invent the electric light? How would Columbus feel ifhe didn't discover America? Well without blackjack, that's how I feel. Well, all that's nothing to howyou feel when you're in love. Oh, don't you understand? I love that man. You-- you're-- oh, Paula. Well, do you think that MichaelDemetri Andrews would come between two people in love? Yes. You hurt me. It's Pop himself. I've got it. Listen, Paula, you can help Clarice, you can get your letter,you can go away from here. I ask for nothing. Nothing? Except the key to the house. Now, don't get worried. I won't take a lot of things. Just a couple of vases, or acarpet, or a piece of gold-- You'll do no such thing, Mr. Andrews. Now Are behave yourself. People go to jail for robbery. Don't worry. Now listen, darling, listen. I know a Hungarian lawyerby the name of Baxter. Well, to him such thingsare nothing, nothing at all. Remember just before I got married to Clarice when that book maker got hurt so badly? Remember? Well, I-- I was definitelyin the wrong then until Baxter pleaded insanity. And the year before that, darling-- Uh, he pleaded insanity and you were acquitted? Yeah. Well, it's a matter of court record. My word of honor. Oh, Mr. Andrews. Well, then, you will get the key? Mm-hmm. That's great. You'll go to town right now? Oh, Mr. Andrews, definitely, definitely. That's good. HANK: Jeez, this is no place for you. Now wait a minute. Don't get excited. Be calm, Pop. Now listen, listen Steve-- She's not going through withit if I have to commit murder. Murder? Steve, you can't go around killing people. She isn't here. Andrews isn't here. Honest, Pop. She went to Poughkeepsie like she said. There's nobody in Andrews's room. What room? 703 on the first floor. Steve! Now you've done it. -Oh. Oh, what do we do? He'll murder him. Help! Steve's going to kill a man. Mr. Andrews. Mr. Cormack. Yes. --I have been wanting to talkto you for quite some time. Yes. I've been looking for a chance to talk to you. Splendid. We can settle this whole matter as gentlemen. As gentlemen. That's right. [loud crash] Man and a woman. Pop killed him. Ah! Murder? Yes. Yes. [interposing voices] Come on, hurry up. Come on. Steve, you can't murder him. It's agin' the rules. Burton. Burton. Oh, Burton. -What? What? Oh, Paula, go away. No, sir. Now you sit up here and listen. I've got the most amazing news. All right, all right. Turn your back. I'll get into my robe. Here. Don't mind me. After what I've been through,life holds no terrors. The police have arrested Andrews. Police? When? Last year when he married Clarice. Isn't it lovely? Last year? Paula, please go away. Oh, but he was acquitted,pleaded insanity. Burton, don't you understand? A judge and a jury saidAndrews was insane at the time he married Clarice. Paula, you call at the oddest hours. But isn't insanity one of the good causes for annulling a marriage? What's that? Isn't insanity one of the cause for annuling-- I heard you the first time. Why, of course it is. That's all we need. I'll file the annulment papers in the morning. Oh, Burton. I've won. I'm finished. I'm free. And when Clarice gets back, she'll be free. She's coming back? Oh, yes. I wired her days ago, as soonas we made our deal with Andrew. She's on the plane now,gets here tomorrow night. But Paula, you understand,don't you, that this annulment makes Clarice the real Mrs. Stephen Cormack because when she marriedhim, she was a single woman. Of course. Oh. Clarice is Steve's wife. Yes, Paula. That's the way it is. Well, Clarice always wantedto marry a millionaire. That's the way it is. W-- where on Earth have you been? Shh. Oh, I beg your pardon, ma'am,but I'm at my wit's end. The whole house is at its wit's end. Alfred, please don't tell them I'm here. I've just come back for my clothes. ALFRED: Yes, but-- PAULA: Alfred, promise me. ALFRED: Oh, all right. Very well, ma'am. Very well. [excited screaming] I-- I want to talk to you. What happened? Oh, where'd you go? There she is, big as life. I want the truth. What's been going onbetween you and Mr. Andrews? If he were just another man,there might be some excuse. If he even liked you, it'd be at least honest. But to fall in love with someman that these children paid is bad taste. It's downright depravity. I ought to divorce you. No, Mr. Cormack. You can't divorce me and you can't bawl me out because I'm not your wife. Just let me be a lesson to you. I'm the sort of thing that happens when you start proposing between drinks. Oh, oh well-- You married my sister, and youcan't blame her because, well, you're nice enough to make any woman forget she's got a husband. And you can't blame me because I was trying to save my sister from jail. Why, you can't even blame Andrews because she was his wife. So you see, Mr. Cormack, it was all your fault. Everything's going to be all right. Clarice's first marriage is being annulled. But Mr. Cormack, don't ever leta thing like this happen again. MAID: And us treating hershameful, the whole lot of us. Just think of what she's done for us. And now she's going. Don't let her. Get down on your knees and beg her to stay. Well, don't sit there doing nothing. Get going, Pop. -Hurry, please. -Mrs. Cormack. misses, uh-- -Lady. Yeah. Hey, lady! -Lady! -Lady, look. Listen. Lady, what's your name? Paula Kendall. Go on, Steve. Down on your knees to her. Tell here we think she's swell. They think you're swell. Tell her what you think. I think so, too. Tell here we love her. We do, Paula Kendall. We love you. We don't want you to go. We want you to stay here from now on. How about it? Oh, you make me awfully happy, and very proud, and I love you, all three. But I can't stay. You see, you're my sister's husband and you're my sister's children. I don't belong here anymore. Nonsense. I don't even know your sister. You married her. She's the real Mrs. Cormack. What are we going to do? There's nothing any of uscan do except, well, maybe help me pack [sobbing] Good bye, Paula. Good bye, ma'am. Good bye, Cook. Good bye, ma'am. [crashing] Patricia! I-- I wanted you to have this. Oh, darling. It's a little too heavy to carry, Pat. May we send it to you? Yes, care of the AmericanMedical Research of Haiti. Good bye, darling. Good bye, Hank. Good bye, lady. Good bye, Mr. Cormack. Good bye. I beg pardon, but it's the other Mrs. Cormack to see Mr. Cormack. PAULA: Clarice, baby. Don't you baby me. You're the man I want to talk to. Yes. Yes, there are a few things I should explain. Michael here's done all theexplaining I want to listen to. And of all the outrageoussituations I ever stepped into, this is the worst. Well, who are you to talk? My little sweet, I'm yourmother, and I'm your wife, and I come home to find my legally married husband carrying on withmy own sister clandestinely in the open. PAULA: Clarice-- STEPHEN: I can explain-- Throw her out, Pa. I'm going to sue you,Mr. Cormack, for divorce, and I'm going to name myown sister as correspondent. Clarice, if you do that-- We'll be free. Yes. I'll be free to do as I please. Well, that's none of my business. All I want is to seejustice done and done fast. Mr. Cormack-- CLARICE: Michael. Just one moment, my angel face. I'm just trying to explain to Mr. Cormack that out in Belmont, he owns half a horse. Boss, Ms. Patricia. CLARICE: Michael. Just like a poodle. [music playing]
