So nice of you to join US. Well, ladies, it's nice to see you all here. I see many old faces, and quite a few new faces-- I see many old faces and quite a few new faces among you. For those of you who are here for the first time, let me bid you a special welcome, and say that this marks the 97th year the penfield academy has commenced its business, and by business, I mean that we are in the business of learning, of working hard and playing hard, of studying hard and praying hard. As Thomas Edison, that great man, once remarked, "genius is comprised of 10 parts: "One part inspiration, 9 parts perspiration." Well, I hope we have a few geniuses in the audience who will take that to heart. He that walketh uprightly, walketh surely, but he that perverteth his ways shall be known. Let US pray. Our father... Our father, who art in heaven, hallowed be... You're off to a great start. I couldn't care less. Shh! On earth as it is in heaven. Give US this day our daily bread... [Bell tolls] Abby! Abby Reed, muffy Pratt! I hate to do this, Abby, but you were late, and that's a demerit, and I'm afraid I'm going to have to give you both demerits for talking in assembly. Honestly, I hate to do it, but as president of the student council, I couldn't very well see you and not report you, now could I? Hey, Laura, how are you? Nice to see you again. Did you have a nice vacation? Fine. Thanks. Did you go to the cape again this year? Excuse me. Could you tell me where Mrs. Moran's class is? Abby: Yes. You go through that door, up that one flight of stairs, take a right, and it's your second door on your left. Turn right. Second door on my left. Thank you very much. Laura: I suppose you think it's terribly funny Abby: The sooner she learns this place is one part inspiration and 9 parts bullshit, the better off she'll be. ♪ ♪ Play ball! Ann, pass. Ann, 2 dribbles, pass. Third? Ow! Reed! Third base! Take a shot! Take a shot! Good! Good! This is basketball. Shoot, Ann. Come on. Try it again. Try it again. Pick it up and pass. You got to third base? Keep your eye on the ball. Michael Brooks. He goes to St. ambrose. Uhh! Thanks a bunch! Muffy, summer's over! Look alive! What's it like? What? Third base! Oh, it's ok, I guess. Third's sort of icky, too, but in a nice kind of way. Are you gonna go all the way? Don't know. I'll bet. I don't! A month and a half before he did it. My summer was all right, I guess. I don't know. I really liked this guy who was a lifeguard at the club, but he was too old for me. He's graduating from college this year. I wish I was a blonde. Michael goes to St. ambrose, huh? Yes. Naturally, my parents can't stand him. How come? And my father's afraid he's a communist 'cause his father campaigned for adlai Stevenson. Is he? What? Communist? No. Going to seduce you. Probably. I mean, I really wanted to do it this summer. I really did. Why didn't you? Because, you know, I was afraid if I did, he wouldn't respect me. We only met this summer. Does that stuff get all over your pillow? Yes. I wonder what it's like. I'm still stuck on third base. Have you ever spoken to anybody who did it, I mean, in detail? My mother. She gave me a detailed account of how I was found under a cabbage leaf on my grandfather's farm. Maybe that is where she got me. That would explain why my father left her. Oh, I think it's ok if you really love someone. The thing is you'd have to be sure that they really love you, too. That way you won't feel cheap or anything. That depends. I mean, if your husband's the one who did it to you beforehand, but if he's not-- hi, gang. Anner!hey, Annie babes. I can't stay. I just dropped in to say hello. Prune face is on the prowl. Doesn't that stuff get all over your pillow? Did you have a good summer? Ugh! Did you go out west? No. We went to Europe. Oh, you're lucky. I never want to see another ruin as long as I live. Uh-oh. I hear the old bat comin'. I'll see ya. You are on your way to where, miss Alden? To my room, miss picard. I was under the impression I had to go to the bathroom. See that you go before the second bell next time. I'm sorry, miss picard, but you can't control when you have to-- you can, and you will. Good night, miss Alden. Watch it, miss Alden! I don't even know anyone I'd like to do it with. How about Malcolm? Malcolm? I'd never do it with Malcolm. He really loves you. He's so gangly and uncoordinated. Michael's captain of the soccer team this year. They let Malcolm carry their equipment for them last year, but now they won't even let him sit on the bench during the games. They're afraid it will give the other team too much confidence. I think he's really very sweet. "Sweet." the perfect word for him. It's not his fault he was born a fig Newton. Just wait until he gets interested in someone else. Then you'll like him. I don't like fig Newtons. Miss picard: No talking after lights out. That's a demerit each. Abby: Shit. 2 each. Blessed is the food which we are about to receive from the father our god from whom all blessings flow. Amen. Amen. Dorothy broke my popover record this week. She ate 19 with butter, honey, everything. It seems to me, miss Alden, that instead of concentrating on other people's eating habits, we should look after our own. I don't care for any, thank you. Well, gang, it's split-piss soup for the third night running. What is everyone wearing for the dance tomorrow night? We're not allowed to wear red, did you hear? What? In front of the men. Well, I was thinking of wearing shocking pink. Do you think that's ok? Tough beans if it isn't. Guess what we're having tomorrow night? Lobster newburg? Wrong! Cream chicken. Are you kidding? Before a dance? There must be a revolution in the kitchen. It just so happens that we're never having lobster newburg again, and do you know why not? Because Mrs. Pendleton read somewhere that shellfish is an aphrodisiac. Hence, to prevent mass rape, lobster newburg has been stricken from the repertoire. How pathetic. Miss moran, do you think shellfish are an aphrodisiac? Oh, I wouldn't know, dear. Miss moran, is it true they put saltpeter in our food before every dance to calm US down? I think you must ask the dietitian, Abby. I'm sure that anything you girls request she'll be most happy to get for you. [Ringing] I'd like to announce there will be a brief meeting concerning the girls attending the St. ambrose mixer tomorrow evening. Would all you young ladies kindly give your undivided attention to Mrs. Pendleton, who will fill you in on the procedures. Thank you. Now, before I begin, would you all please draw yourselves up and take a deep breath. [Inhaling] That's better. Good posture is the secret of good listening. Carriage and bearing are the most important qualities in creating a good first impression. Those of you who have attended my public speaking classes... Do you think she ever did it? Once, and it was by herself. Now, as you all know, tomorrow night is the St. ambrose mixer. Mixers are optional to both juniors and seniors. We are looking forward to a very pleasant evening. Music will be provided by Mr. Orlento carletti and his orchestra. And for seniors only, there will be one hour of smoking. Yay! Yay! Yay! All right, girls! And we're going to have a lovely wine punch. [Applause] All right, girls. You're limited to 2 glasses each. Aw! Aw! Aw! Aw! But for those of you who are not, I'll run through them briefly. Tonight we will be drawing numbers from this fishbowl. The young men at St. ambrose will be doing the same thing. When you arrive, you will stand on the right of the gym, and when your number is called, you will walk gracefully up to the front of the gym, where you will meet your date with the corresponding number. [Band plays] Mrs. Pendleton: Number 1. Number 2. Number 3. Number 4. He's the one standing over there. He's got a gray jacket on. Number 5. There he is. That guy? Number 6. We've got a problem. Something wrong, muffy? Oh, no, nothing, Mr. Keats. I was just blowing my nose. You're allowed to blow your nose in the gym, muffy. You're not supposed to leave without a chaperone. You know that. I know. I'm sorry. Let's go back, shall we? Number 24. Number 25. Hi, muffy. Oh, hi, Malcolm. See you later, muffy. Bye. Thank you, Mr. Keats. What number are you? 30. Well, I'm 41. No. That's ok. Oh, it's no trouble. No. It's too late. I'm next. Oh, muffy, i-- I'll see you later. 30, sir. And yours, Helen? 29, Mrs. Pendleton. Where the devil is number 30? Here I am. Oh, muffy. Now we're straightened out. Helen, I want you to meet David... Walton. Walton. David, this is Helen Connery. How do you do? I'm sorry I was late. Oh, don't worry about it. Buzzy knight. Buzzy knight. I hate these things, don't you? Yeah. Right. Do you know Helen? Who? Helen Connery-- that blonde girl that was just there? No. Is that her name--Helen? Double cut? Hi. Hi. How are you? Fine. You? You look-- yeah. You, too. Um, what sports are you interested in? Tennis, basketball, soccer. You see, actually, the whiteness of the whale is the most important aspect of the novel in that melville is trying to make a statement about the nature of good and evil. Who's your favorite author? Helen James-- Henry James. Have you seen any good movies lately? Yeah. Uh, excuse me. Do you mind if we, uh, double cut? No. Guess you're stuck with me. Would you dance with me now, muffy? I wish we could be alone. Me, too. Did you miss me? Did you miss me? I asked you first. Sort of. I missed you a lot. Yeah. Me, too. Can you ever get out of this place? Normally, I should have another free weekend this term, but I've got so many demerits, they won't let me take it, but I could take an overnight. When? Uh, where could I stay? When can you take it? [Drum roll] Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention, please? We've reached the end of our evening, and a very pleasant and successful evening it's been, wouldn't you agree? [Applause and cheering] We'd like to thank all you young men from St. ambrose for joining US here this evening, and now the orchestra will play the last dance of the evening. Will you all return to your original partners, please, for the last dance? I'd like to take this opportunity to thank all you lovely young ladies for affording St. ambrose a little feminine companionship for the evening. All right. All right. All right. There are 2 busses outside. Roll will be taken promptly, so let's make these good-byes as swift as is humanly possible. Boo! Boo!Boo! Boo! If it's true love, you can write her a letter. [Band plays good night, ladies] Excuse me, buzzy. It's me again. Hi. Hi. Do you wanna dance? Sure. Make it a 10, and I'll go by myself. You promise you'll meet me? I promise. Well, are you sure you wanna go through with it? You'd never hurt me, would you? Never. Never, ever. [Kissing] We better watch it. When exactly will you come? I could take an overnight in 2 weeks. Ok. What day? Um, Saturday. I'll say I'm staying at my grandmother's in Boston. 2 weeks from tonight. Is it a deal? It's a deal. Hey. Sorry. Hey, Malcolm. Hi, Malcolm. Hi, Abby. Have either of you seen muffy around? Yeah. She was dancing with you all night. Yeah. I know, but she had to go back to buzzy for the last dance, and he says she ran off in tears for no reason. What? I was just wondering if you'd seen her. Oh, I better go find her. Malcolm, would you please do me a favor and get lost? Sure, Mike. Sorry. Just wondering if you'd seen her. I'll see you, Abby. Oh, Michael, I hope nothing's wrong. Nothing's wrong, and, quite frankly, what we were discussing is a little bit more important. I know. Will you tell her I'm standing in front of the bus? Yes, Malcolm. I'm just making sure. Oh, Michael, it must be so awful to love somebody that doesn't love you. That'll never happen to US, will it? I'll always love you, Abby. Are you sure? Look, it's up to you, Abby. I know. That's what I'm afraid of. Well, you want to, don't you? [Ring]Listen, that's the warning bell. You want to, don't you? Yes. [Ring] I gotta go. Listen, don't forget that I love you, that you love me. I'll try not to. And call me if you have any problems. I will. [Quietly] You, too. Muff? Hey, muffy. Muff, are you ok? Yes. What's the matter? You better start getting undressed. What did you think of Michael? I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to introduce you. Did you have a nice time? Malcolm was looking for you, you know. Hey, muff... Muffy, what's the matter? Nothing. Please tell me. What is it? It's nothing. I just feel pukey. That's all. It must have been the cream chicken. Why are you crying? 'Cause I feel like it. Well, why do you feel like it? 'Cause I feel like it. Is that a crime? Sorry. Oh, Abby... God, I'm just such a big nothing. What is it? What happened? Nothing... Except I wish I was pretty. Muff, you are pretty. You're beautiful. No, I'm not. I'm not, and I don't care, usually. It's just that sometimes it would make life a lot easier, you know what I mean? It would just make life a lot simpler. Tell me exactly what happened. I don't know. I just never know what to say. You know what I mean? I tried to talk about him. I asked him what sports he was interested in and what books he liked, and he'd tell me, and I wouldn't know what to say next. Well, he's got to make an effort, too. I know, but my heart's pounding a mile a minute, I'm so afraid I'm gonna say something dumb. Everybody says dumb things. That's just the way everybody is. It may be the way everybody is, but it's not how they seem to me. Oh, muff, you're so much smarter and brighter than-- and then there was this confusion at the beginning. He thought I was Helen Connery. Oh, now I begin to understand. No. It's not her fault. She got up to the platform late, and Mrs. Pendleton thought she was number 30, but, really, she was 29. It's not her fault she's gorgeous. That's the oldest trick in the book. She pulled that exact same thing on Ann last year. I mean, she's applying to Wellesley, right? She's a rat. He took one look at me-- well, he's human, isn't he? After some girl throws herself at him, and I'm sure that's exactly what she did, I mean, he'd be disappointed with whatever came next. He'd be disappointed if Sandra Dee came next. Yeah? Well, thanks anyway. Well, if he didn't see through Helen Connery, then he's not worth a second thought anyway. He was so cute, though. What's his name? Buzzy knight. You can't make people like you. I always seem to like people who don't even know I'm alive. You know, just once I wish I could meet somebody who I liked and who like me back, just once. You will, muff. It takes time, though. I never really liked anybody before I met Michael. But they liked you. You've always had people who liked you. Well, I certainly never had anybody that loved me the way Malcolm loves you. You should have seen his face. Honestly, he was so worried about you. He came running up to Michael and me after the dance and asked if we'd seen you, and, you know, I was thinking to myself, "he's really very attractive. He has the kind of looks that are gonna age beautifully." Yeah. He'll be a knockout at 90. Good-bye, Mrs. Pendleton. Good-bye, Abigail? Yes. Are you going somewhere? The weekend. My grandmother's. I filled out the form 2 weeks ago. You did? 2 weeks ago? Let me see. 2 weeks ago. Why, here it is. I must have completely forgotten about it. Yeah. Well, good-bye, Mrs. Pendleton. Abigail. Yes, Mrs. Pendleton? She was supposed to call, um...Today. Really? Well, I haven't spoken with her. I'm sure she'll call any minute. I'm sure she will. Abigail? Yes. Perhaps you should wait until your grandmother calls. My train. I'll miss my train. I'm sure she'll call any minute. Sit down. Good-bye, Mrs. Pendleton. Good-bye, Judith. Have a pleasant weekend. I honestly don't know how good-bye, Linda. Have a pleasant weekend. Good-bye, Mrs. Pendleton. I've never had the pleasure of meeting your grandmother. She's very nice. [Telephone rings] Hello? Yes, operator, I'm her. That's me. Hello, grandma? I'm fine. Yes. Everything's all right. Mrs. Pendleton would like to speak to you a moment. No. Everything's fine, grandma, really. Mrs. Pendleton would just like to say hello. That's all. Hello, Mrs. Reed. Margaret Pendleton. I'm fine, thank you. No, no. Everything's fine. I simply forgot about Abigail's plans to visit you this weekend, and I wanted the opportunity of saying hello to you. Well, I'm so glad you did, Mrs. Pendleton. Abigail's told me so much about you. Yes. She's a lovely girl, not at all like her mother. I'm so looking forward to her visit this weekend. I almost never get a chance to see her. You know how young people are these days. They always seem to be in such a hurry. Exactly. Oh, by the way, could you please remind Abigail to bring a warm coat? Yes. Gets a bit chilly in Boston, and I don't want her to catch a cold. I certainly will, Mrs. Reed. I look forward to meeting you. I trust you'll be coming up to graduation this spring? Very good. Yes. I'll tell her. Good-bye, Mrs. Reed. Your grandmother asks that you bring a warm coat. Oh, she always worries. She's concerned for your welfare, as we all are. Abigail? Have a pleasant weekend. Thank you. You, too. [Whistle blows] Abby: Are you sure everything's going to be ok? Michael: Yeah, I'm sure, I'm sure. Are you positive? May I help you? Yes. I have a reservation. Certainly. What is your name? Abby. Do you have a last name to go with that? Oh. Parker. Parker. I have a reservation. [Ding] Room 06, fourth floor. The bellboy will show you to your room. Have a good stay. Thank you very much. May I help you? Yes, I'd like a room, please. I have a reservation. Certainly. What is your name? Michael. [Water running] [Gargling] Oh, good evening, sir. Uh, lobby, please. Thank you. Yeah? [Giggles] Where have you been? I don't want to talk about it. Can I come in? Oh. Sorry. You tired? Sort of. Are you? Sort of. Would you like to get undressed? No. I was only kidding. Excuse me. You're naked, aren't you? Yeah. Totally? Yeah. I'm sorry to be such a prude. That's ok. We don't have to do anything, you know. I know. Hey, what are you doing? I thought I'd have a mint. Want one? Those aren't mints. Oh. I mean, just in case we do decide to do something, we have to be careful. We have to be careful, right? You've really thought of everything. I didn't think of those things when... Michael, would you-- I mean, if anything happened, would you marry me? Not that it's going to. But just say it did. And not that i'd go through with it, because I wouldn't. But, you know? If that's what you want, yes, I would. You don't think I'm loose or anything. You know I've never done this before, don't you? I know. It wouldn't matter if you had, Abby. I love you. I love you, Abby. 2? There's no use taking chances. Will you love me in the morning? Of course I will. Probably more. We're gonna do it, aren't we? Yeah, I guess we are. Ok. Do it. We have to want to, you know. I want to. Just get me started. Ok. Answer me one question first. Now what? Is it true you can tell a girl's a virgin by the way she walks? No, but you can tell if a man's a virgin by the way hewalks. No kidding. I didn't know men could be virgins. Are you a virgin? No. How many? One or 2. Well, which is it, one or 2? Uh, one. How was it? I don't want to talk about it with you, Abby. Was she an older woman? Sort of. She was 18, and I was 15. Oh. Was she prettier than me? No. Well, did you love her? Yeah, in a way. More than me? No. Abby... It's gonna hurt, isn't it? Let's forget the whole thing. Ok, fine. That suits me fine. Good. Double good. [Knock knock knock] Who is it? What do you mean, who is it? Come in. Abby, what's the matter? Look at me. I look different, and I feel different. You look exactly the same. Maybe better. No, I don't. [Crying] This is it-- the beginning of the end. You don't love me anymore. What do you mean, I don't love you anymore? I love you. You do? Yeah. Don't you love me? Yes, I do. I love you a lot. What are you getting so upset for? Are you disappointed? No. Could we... Could we what? Is it ok if... I mean, are we allowed to do it again? O, lord, thou hast searched me and known me. Thou knowest my down sitting and mine uprising. Thou understandest my thought afar off. Thou compassest my path and my lying down. Thou art acquainted with all my ways, for there is not a word in my tongue, but lo, o, lord, thou knowest it altogether. Thou hast beset me behind and before... How is your grandmother? Grand. What'd you do? We went out to dinner. Don't tell me about dinner. Tell me about after dinner. I'm getting to that. Weren't you frightened to do it in a hotel? No, why? You could've got caught in a raid. How was it? It was great. We did it twice last night and once this morning. In daylight? Did you cry? Sure. Everybody cries. Did Michael cry? No, you idiot. Did you bleed? No. Did it hurt? Well, sort of, but it's a nice kind of hurt. You know what I mean? No. Buzzy's voice: "Dear muffy, "and I hope you'll forgive me. "It was really not what you thought at all. "It was just a joke between me and David rotham. "We're always kidding around like that. "I'm sorry you misunderstood. "I hope when we see each other again, "we can be friends. Sincerely yours, bayard t. Knight." Do you think they check if you're lying on your s.A.T. Scores? Sure. And you get an automatic 200 for just signing your name. You know, there's only one place for every 50 applications at Wellesley? You have to be such a genius to get into these damn places. Why bother? Hey, what are you so engrossed in? Are you still pondering that letter to buzzy? Hey, muff, snap out of it. Do you think I ought to use a quote from Shakespeare or Mark twain? He doesn't deserve a quote from the yellow pages. He apologized, Abby. I can't hold a grudge for the rest of my life. That's the least he could have done. Must've taken a lot of courage for him to write that letter. Thank heaven for small favors. Anyway, I don't see what the harm is in inviting him to your party just to show there are no hard feelings. You're inviting him to my party? You mind? No, I couldn't care less. It's just that you're asking for it. I'm not asking him to be my date or anything. It's just a simple invitation. Well, keep it simple. I don't think he knows how to read. Very funny. Shakespeare or Mark twain? Malcolm's coming, you know. I know. Muffy: Well, he must like me a little, don't you think, or else why would he have bothered to write me a letter? Abby: Because he's an egomaniac, and he knew you'd enshrine it. He must like me a little, don't you think? I don't know. I think Mark twain's a little lighter, you know, a little more casual. How about Walt Disney? Have you heard anything yet? Nothing. He's a blockhead. He's probably trying to think of an appropriate response. How about something clever, like "yes"? That's appropriate. Maybe he never got my letter. I once got a Christmas present in July from an aunt I didn't like. It came with a note from the post office explaining that the package was on a train and the train got in a wreck in Providence, I think he's a blockhead. You know what was in that package? Gloves. Can you hand me some of those, please? What are you, on a diet? I told you I haven't heard anything. Can I help it if I eat when I'm depressed? Well, it might be a good idea not to weigh a ton just in case he accepts. I'll worry about that when it happens. It is essential that an organism, any organism, be able to use its muscles in smoothly graded contractions. Otherwise, it would be reduced to using its muscles in a series of fast twitches. Now, as we have seen, different animals achieve this movement by all sorts of different methods. Now, will you all grab hold of one of your frog legs and just move it to get the feeling of the muscle. That's right. That-that's good. That's very good. Now, who can tell me how a frog jumps? Miss foster? In the frog muscle, the muscle cells twitch in an all-or-none fashion because a twitch is triggered by an all-or-none action potential. In order to make a graded movement, the motor neutrons are connected to a small patch of muscle cells. By adjusting the firing pattern of the muscle cells, the central nervous system can produce-- [bell rings] Teacher: Wait, wait, wait. Homework. I would like you all to write a 200-word report on some personal experience that you've had from your frog experience. And don't use anything out of your textbook because that won't do. Look. Let's see. It's not the most romantic thing I've ever read. What do you expect him to say to an invitation? Something other than-- "Mr. Bayard t. Knight accepts with pleasure "the kind invitation of miss muffy Pratt to attend miss Abigail Reed's Christmas Eve party." Well, he's coming, and that's all that counts. [O little town of bethlehemplays] [Doorbell rings] Well, you're finally here to help me now that everything's done. I'm sorry. I was getting dressed. You weren't getting dressed all afternoon, were you? And, muffy, don't you look-- well, we're very daring, aren't we? Well, you think it's too much? Quite the contrary. I think it's too little. I think muffy looks great. Of course she does. She looks very pretty. I'm just not used to all this new skin you girls wear nowadays. You look fantastic. Malcolm's gonna die. D-i-e, die. I hope buzzy likes it. Well, if he doesn't, he's even a bigger jerk than I think he is. And since that's impossible, he'll love it. You look beautiful, Abby. You think so? Michael likes me in white. I wonder if that's significant. I hope buzzy likes pink. Abigail. I didn't recognize you. Hi, Mrs. Clairmont. You're a young lady now, aren't you? I hate to say it, but you make me want to commit suicide. Although, at the rate I'm going, you understand, I might as well let it happen naturally. Oh, Abby, you remember my son James. Jamie, say hello to Abigail. Hello. I bet you don't remember that. God. Oh, don't be silly, Jamie. It was the cutest thing. Abby always wondered why you had a teapot and she didn't. Oh, the injustices of life. Would you excuse me a minute? Yes. [Doorbell rings] Where have you been? I thought you'd never get here. Let me look at you. You like it? You're a knockout. Hi, Malcolm. Hi, Abby. Malcolm's here. Oh, hi, Malcolm. Hi, Michael. Hi. I hardly recognized you. Oh, thanks. Oh, I didn't mean... You know what I meant. You look-- you look just-- come on, let's get some booze. You want to dance? The band sounds great. No. Could we just sit down for a while? Sure. How about in there? Malcolm. Hmm? Why do you like me? I don't know. I--i like you... What kind of question is that? I'm just trying to figure out well, i--i think you're funny and... Pretty. I've known you for a long time. I know, but, Malcolm, I'm really not very nice to you. You're not? No. Haven't you ever noticed that? I guess I have sometimes. I don't know why I like you, muffy. I think you're a very... Deep person. Deep. You do. [Doorbell rings] You like buzzy, don't you? I hardly even know him. You invited him here. So what if I did? Do you think he's too attractive for me? I didn't say that. Well, how do you know you don't know anything of the sort. Hi. Merry Christmas. Hi, muff. Hey, I'm sorry to be so late. I got a little lost. That's ok. It's legal, see? Abby's dancing at the moment. I'll introduce you to her when she's through. Great. This looks like a real nice party. I like the decorations. Thanks. Abby and I spent all day fixing them. They look swell. Do you like eggnog? They have the greatest eggnog. Yeah, but, uh... Well, could it wait just a second? Muffy, you know Helen, don't you? Hi, muff, great to see you. Hi. It's over there. Excuse me. Malcolm. What? Muffy? M-Muffy. Muffy! Muffy. Muffy, what's the matter? Here, take my coat. You're gonna freeze. Malcolm, are you in love with me? Yeah, I guess I am. Do you want to consummate your love? Muffy, what are you saying? Well, I think I'm being perfectly clear. What word in the sentence don't you understand? I'm asking you if you want to do it with me? Uh, hold it. Hold it right there. You're asking me if I want to go all the way with you? Yes. Will you let go of me? Muffy, will you talk to me? I don't want to talk anymore. Do you want to make love to me or not? No. Y-Yes, of course I do, but I don't think we should, not when you're in this frame of mind. How the hell do you know what frame of mind I'm in? I want to be made love to. Now. Well, do you want to make love to me or not? If you don't, just say so, and I'll find somebody who does. Well, now, let me get this straight. You're gonna find anybody, just anybody. That's right. You don't need me, I guess. You just need a body. That's right. What are you afraid of? Nothing. I bet you've never done it. Do you have to shout like that? You're avoiding my question. Have you done it? Of course. I-I'm 17, aren't I? Malcolm. What? When did you? I'd rather not talk about it. Who'd you do it with? Nobody you know. Oh, really? Yes. Why, you don't believe me? No. No offense, of course. Well, I have. How was it? Great. It was great. That's what Abby said. Abby? Oh, don't tell anybody about it, ok? With Michael? Yes. Wow. There's nothing wrong with it, is there? I mean, you did it. Yeah, but, uh... She's a girl. So? Well, I mean, uh... She's not-- she's not a virgin. Wouldn't you marry a girl who wasn't a virgin? I--i don't know. Malcolm. Well, how come you don't have to be pure, then? 'Cause I'm a man. Well... I want to do it. I want to see what all the fuss is about. And I want something that's completely my own, can you understand that? Wh-when do you want to do it? Right now. What? Here? Why not? Well... F-For one thing, it's sort of ordinary in a car. I bet you're scared. Of course not. Well... You're scared. There. Isn't that cozy? Yeah. Sort of. Muffy, you sure we're doing the right thing? Yes. Say you love me, Malcolm. I love you, muffy. Is it third base? Yeah. Tell me what to do. Is that it? Yeah. Could you move, please? Sorry. Maybe we should go back inside. You go ahead if you like. I'm gonna stay here for a while. No, go ahead if you like. I-I'm sorry it wasn't better for you. Oh, it was. It was fine. I just don't see what all the fuss is about. Me, neither. I thought you said you'd done it before. I lied. I thought so. I'm sorry. I didn't mean it like that. It doesn't make any difference. I just don't see what all the big deal is about. It's not your fault. I guess we better get back inside. I'll help you up. No, I can get up myself, thanks. You feel any different? Yeah. You? No, not a bit. I thought I would, but I don't. Boy, I sure don't see what all the big fuss is about. Me, neither. Boy, I sure don't see it. [Bell rings] [Bell rings] We did it! We passed French! Abby, I think I'm pregnant. [Typewriter keys click] Mrs. Pratt. Here. I mean, that's me. Would you come this way, please? Sit down, please. We've received the results of your test. It's positive, as you thought. Congratulations. You're pregnant. You're not very happy about this, are you, Mrs. Pratt? No. May I ask have you told Mr. Pratt yet? No. I-- there is no Mr. Pratt, is there? Yes. He's a student-- no. Do you know who the father is? Of course I do. What kind of question is that? I'm sorry. I'm only trying to help you. Well, I do know who the father is. Do you want to marry him? Well, my dear, you're in very serious trouble. You know that, don't you? I know. Have you given any thought to what you're going to do? Yes. Dr. Madden, could you-- I mean, could you... Perform an abortion? No, I couldn't. Do you know anyone who could? I'm afraid I don't. What am I gonna do? Well, you should've thought of that before. But I did. I thought you couldn't get pregnant the first time. Why on earth did you think that? I don't know. My girlfriend told me. You mean this is your very first time? First and only. Well, that's very bad luck, isn't it? It's typical. The only thing I can suggest is that you go to your parents and tell them. Do you feel you can do that? Abby: He could've helped you if he wanted to. Damn him! Muffy: He was nice, nice as he could be. Nice, my ass. It just hit me, you know? What am I gonna do? I mean, what am I gonna do? Just listen. Everything's gonna be all right, you hear? You're not gonna do anything. I'm gonna arrange it all. First of all, we have to tell Malcolm. No. Yes. Want some licorice?Ok. We'll have to get you an abortion. It's the only solution. Are you listening? Yes. And we're gonna have to tell Michael. Why don't we just take out an ad in the Boston globe? Michael: Ok. Now, this is the plan. We go to the address at 21 grover street tomorrow morning at 8:00 sharp. It's sort of a hotel. We go to the registration desk across from the main lobby and ask for Marge. Marge is gonna take US to some place in south Boston or something like that. Apparently it changes all the time. From there, I'm not exactly sure what's gonna happen. I'd never buy shoes like that. Abby: You're not sure what's gonna happen? Don't you know anything about who's gonna do it? It's hard enough finding anyone at all. I want to go in there. Now, I'm assured by this guy at school that this Marge person knows exactly what she's doing. Could you lend me $5.00? Are you at all interested in this? Me? Sure. Gee, I don't know, Michael. Either do I, to say the least. All right, wise guys. Perhaps someone would suggest an alternative plan. He's got you there. Hello, frog. Abby: If you ask me, I don't think it's in the best of taste for you to be quite so cheerful. I'm not being cheerful, just practical. There's nothing we can do, if I don't mind the arrangements, you shouldn't. Boy, this place is really depressing. Can we go to a nice restaurant? Consider it the last wish of the condemned, ok? Abby: Where we gonna stay tonight, anyway? Michael: This guy's apartment. He won't be there. Abby: Does anyone want to go out and get roaring drunk? Ok. It was just a suggestion. Abby: Are you sleeping? Muffy: Obviously not. You sure you want to go through with all this? Not such a big deal. Tomorrow it'll all be over. Malcolm wants to marry you. You could get married. It's not too late. No. Thanks, anyway. I can't seem to get away with anything. Everything seems to happen to me instead of for me. It's like I have no control. This time, just once, I want some control over my life. And having a baby. This is my decision. My own. It's what I want. It's not a complicated operation. I mean, it's like having your tonsils out, right? Doesn't take very long. So simple. Oh, shit. I'll be right back. Michael: Where you going? I'll just be a minute. Hey, look, we don't have time. Dear god... Oh, skip it. Michael: Come on. We're gonna be late. Here we are. Malcolm: It doesn't look so bad, muff. It's not so good, either. Oh, Jesus. I guess this is the lobby. Michael: Uh, we'd like to speak with Marge, please. You Mr. Brooks? Yes. I'm Marge. You're Marge? That's right. I'll be right with youse. Come on in. Is it cold out? It's not too bad. Which one is the one? Youse all ain't goin' with her. What do you mean? Oh, please. No way. Well, maybe one. I'll go with her. Are you sure? I don't know. No. Who's got the money? I have it. I think I'd rather give it to you after it's over. Look, you want this done or not, Sonny? Are you the one who's gonna do it? No. But i'm gonna take youse to the one who is, and I can't do that unless I get paid first. Give him the money, Malcolm. Wait a minute. What guarantee do we have that everything's gonna be ok? None. What do you kids want? Think you're going on a cruise or buying a hi-fi set? You know what I mean? Just give him the money. I don't know. There's nothing else we can do. Yes, there is. We can go elsewhere. Look, now you can either give me the money and we go, or you don't give me the money, and you go home. Malcolm. Malcolm, please. Here. You can count it if you like. Don't worry. Abby: Marge is an unusual name for a man, isn't it? Yep. Ok, fall out. Ok, this is where I leave you. You go straight in that building, somebody will meet you, and they'll take it from there. So long. Aren't you going with US? No. My job is finished now. Now look--now you look! And I don't want any trouble from you. I think we want our money back. It doesn't work that way. Understand? And I'm losing my Patience with you kids. Abby, come on. We've come this far. Are you sure, muffy? There's nothing else we can do. Now listen to her. We come highly recommended, right? Now don't worry.That's true. I got to go. So long. Hello! Don't worry, muffy. Are you kidding? Hello! Is anybody here? Oh, god. Abby. Don't cry, muffy. Everything's going to be ok. Hello! Hello! Is anybody up there? Coming. Coming. Hold your horses. What is this, a sister act? Ha ha ha ha ha ha. Marge said we could both come. Oh, he did, huh? Well, you can't. I want one of ya. That's the deal. Which of ya is it? Me. You come with me and you wait here. I have to go with her, or else she won't be able to go through with it. Suit yourself. No. Wait. Please take me. Muffy, no. If you get up there and you don't want to go through with it, get out. Promise me.Ok, I promise. If you feel the slightest bit uncomfortable, get out. We'll figure something else out, really. Don't be afraid not to go through with it. Ok. Come on. [Knock knock] Man: Come in. Hiya! Hi. Sit down. Relax. You want a cup of tea? No, thank you. Aw, come on. Have some. You'll feel better. It's a very special blend. Lapsang tea, from the orient. Come on. It'll warm you up. I know you're nervous. They make you go through a whole lot of cloak and dagger stuff, don't they? I'm really sorry about that, but they have to do that to protect themselves and me. I understand. Can I have a little smile? Hey, don't. Don't be afraid. Who's gonna do it? Me. My name's frank. What's yours? Muffy. Muffy. That's great. Now listen, muffy. I want you to know a few things, ok? First of all, I'm a medical student. I've had a lot of practice performing operations. And abortion is a very simple and painless operation. Come on, smile. Can I have a little smile, please? Oh, that's nice. You look really pretty when you smile, you know that? No. You do. Now, I want you to know a little bit more about me, too. I, uh, I do this partially for the money, that's true, I think that every woman should have the right to choose whether or not she wants to bring a life into the world. I've seen too many unwanted kids. Life's tough enough without starting out that way, right? I know exactly what you mean. You made a big decision in deciding to come here, muffy, and I want you to know it's a decision I respect, ok? Do you feel a little better? Yeah, I do. Do you? You feel well enough to start? Ok. Ok. Go behind those curtains and remove your clothes. You'll find a little robe there. You can put it on over your blouse, ok? I'll take that. Boy, this isn't the way I thought it would be. I mean, you're not at all like I expected. Oh? What did you expect? A witch with a coat hanger, like that lady who brought me up here. I know. I know what you mean. My contacts leave a lot to be desired. But you know that woman who showed you up here-- Mrs. H, we call her-- she's really a doll. I know you might find that hard to believe, but she is. Would you just lie down on that table? Ok. Will I be able to have children after this? Sure, muff. All we're gonna do is give you what's called a dnc, which means we're gonna scrape out the uterus and cause you to miscarry. You're not even gonna feel anything. Just put your legs up there, will you? Just like that. That's good. Ok. Now... Don't be nervous, ok? Just relax. Are you in school, muff? Yes. In boarding school. Is this your last year? Yes. Are you gonna go to college? If I get in anywhere. Oh, don't worry. You will. Where have you applied? Smith and mount holyoke. Mount holyoke, huh? My fiancée goes there. Oh. Does she like it? Um... Well... I don't think she's too crazy about it, muffy. All through, muffy. It's all over. Is that all? That's all. It didn't hurt much. I told you it wouldn't. I wouldn't lie to you. Now, I want you to take it real easy for a while, ok? You're gonna be bleeding a little, so don't be alarmed. Also, you're gonna have some pain. Not too much, but you may be a little uncomfortable, so I want you to take one of these pills every 4 hours, ok, starting right now. Here you go. Here you go, muff. You feel all right? Feel well enough to get dressed? Because if you don't, take your time. There's no rush. No. I feel all right. I do. You're a lovely girl, muffy. Aw... [Footsteps approaching] Muffy? Yeah. How was it? Wonderful. Hey, isn't there a dictionary anywhere around this hole? Aren't you supposed to have gym this period? Abby. Muffy. Turn over. You're burning up. I know. There's some-- some blood. Oh, my god. I'm gonna go get the nurse. No. Wait. Wait for what? Abby, I'm frightened. Now listen, we don't have to tell her anything. I'm gonna go get the nurse. No. Yes. All right, where's the fire? Little fever, huh? Did you have your flu shot like I told you to? You girls. Open your mouth. Abby, don't you have a class now? Yes. You better get going, then. Go on. She'll survive. Please let me stay. No. Now off you go to class. Now. Ok. Ok. But I have to find my dictionary first. You hurry up about it. Well, well, well. We have a nice little temperature. Good. The infirmary can use a little business. Come on. I'll help you up, dear. We can get your things later. Abby, enough is enough. Aah! It must've just started. Abigail, what's going on here? Hand me a towel. Jesus. This child is hemorrhaging. How did this happen? Well, she--no. You promised. Do you know something about this? No. I mean-- no. Muffy! Muff? Muff, it's me. Hi! I brought you some flowers, but the nurse said you can't have any in your room. It's a rule or something. Anyway, it was just a geranium plant 'cause that's all the florist had left. And geraniums stink, as you know. How are you feeling? Shitty. Oh, well, you'll be outta here in a few days. Thank god. I'm trying to get you a record player in the meantime. Parents? What? My parents? Oh, parents! I thought you said "planets." They're coming. They're on their way. Bullshit. Nobody can find them. Malcolm? He'll be here tomorrow. He's coming down with Michael from St. ambrose. Did you tell him? Michael told him. And did he laugh? No, you idiot, he didn't laugh. You're so crazy sometimes. Why should he laugh? Well, you gotta admit, it's funny. If you made a bet on this happening, you could give someone 100-to-one odds against it, right? Yeah. Well, I'd just like to get my hands on dear, understanding frank. You don't have permission to be in here. Well, the nurse didn't say anything about me. She said something about my flowers. Yes, well, the nurse, unfortunately, is senile, so out. Oh, please? Oh, he doesn't mean it. He's just kidding. I certainly do mean it. You can come back tomorrow afternoon, but right now, skedaddle. Can't be all that good, either. Ok. I'll see you later. Ok. Bye. Bye. How are you feeling, muffy? Shit--rotten. How much more time have we got? About...i don't know. He said this afternoon. I guess 1:30's this afternoon, isn't it? It's funny. My mother was sick here once. What's so funny about that? Nothing, except here I am again, that's all. Is she gonna be all right? Sure, but she looks like hell now. Boy, she has some luck, huh? Hey, you didn't tell anybody why you came here today, did you? No. Hey, Malcolm, where are you going? Let him go. Look, I threw up when I told him. Well, there's one thing I know. What's that? It's not supposed to be like this. What's it supposed to be like? I don't know. But not like this. It's right around the corner here on the left. Yeah? I thought that was supposed to be for muffy. Well, the best presents are the ones you like yourself. It's tomorrow afternoon. Please don't. Please...don't. Give me your hand, Abby. No. No! No! No!Give me your hand. Hey, Abbs, you're gonna be late. I'll be right there. Do you need any help? No, thanks. Do you know if the tassel goes on the left or the right? I don't know. I'd better go. My mother's getting antsy. I'll save you a place. Thanks. Abbs, promise me we'll see each other. I'll write, I really will. I know people say they will and they don't, but I really will. You and muffy, you were the only ones in this creepy place that I ever wanted to see again. Let's grow up and have children and varicose veins and still see each other. Promise me? I promise. I'm scared, aren't you? Yeah. I never thought I'd miss this place. Now, all of a sudden, I don't want anybody to have my room or use my locker. Isn't that crazy? No. Oh, Abbs, you're the greatest. Oh, I hope I don't look back on this place as the best years of my life. You sure you don't know if the tassel goes on the right? I'm sure. Do you want to be alone? Yeah. Just for a minute. Ok. I'll save you a place. The tassel goes on the left, not the right. Thanks, Laura. You're going to be late. I'm coming. It's after 11:30. Give me a demerit. Send it to my college. Maybe you can open up an account for me there. I was just telling you it's after 11:30. That's all. You're right. Thank you. I'll be right there. [Tinkling]
