- In watching television and going to the movies, you might get the impression that the great human dramas of today happen only to affluent people. People who live in and near the cities. You might say the so-called sophisticates. The truth is that real dramas are taking place every day to real people. During the recent trucker's strike, I talked with some Americans that the media seems to have overlooked. About how long have you been driving a rig like this? About 15 years. Do you work for a company? No, I'm an independent. Independent driver that means you own your own rig. Yeah, me and the bank. - What sort of investment does a rig like this take to own? About 38 thousand dollars. - I imagine that puts quite a bit of pressure on you making monthly payments. My wife works. What kind of work does she do? She's a bartender. How do you stay ahead in business? How do you get your loads lined up? - Oh independent brokers, if I don't get anything well I just sit. - So if someone controlled the brokers and the shippers, they'd be controlling the trucking industry. They do. - You told me before that you carry a gun with you, is that true? Damn right. Why do you? - To protect myself, if someone tries to sneak into your cap, just show them the gun. And they'll mosey on down the road. Just how far would you go to protect your rig and your profession. - You never know, until you're put to the test. # Long lonely years here without you # Long years to call out your name # Wondered along through the desert # Lord how I prayed for the rain # Long years and finally it came # Darling it's so good to hold you again # Fear was my constant companion # Holding me sleepless each night # Memories danced in the shadows # Cast by the first rays of light # How can you hold a shadow tight # I wanted to hold you with all of my might # Friends and neighbors came to call # Found me staring at the picture on the wall # They would talk to me like old friends do # But I was drifting and dreaming of you # Darling it's so good to hold you again # Friends and neighbors came to call # Found me staring at your picture on the wall # They would talk to me like old friends do # But I was drifting and dreaming of you # But I was drifting and dreaming of you - This kind of money's a little out of my ballpark. - Well, we've got this WT9 Valden Ford down here I was telling you about. We had to repossess it, the boy couldn't keep payments up on it but for the kind of money we're talking about it outta make you a good piece of equipment. It's got a NTC 350 Cummins in it, RTO9513 transmission. - Still talking about an awful lot of money. - Talk it over with your Misses, see what she thinks. I'll tell you what, I'll even throw in a paying job to you specification just to help you young folks out. - Fellow shit kickers, this here is Carol Jo Hummer and I'm commencing broadcasting to you today from my new bucket, which from now on will be known as the Blue Mule, we're in business for ourselves, me and the mule, and we aim to get our butts outta Hawk. So all you turkeys better watch out we don't get all the work. Amen to that. Happy honkings Blue Mule, say what's that you got between your legs sonny? It's the blue mule a happy honky. Got a Ford WT9 thousand Cummins. - What are you Hummer, some kind of outlaw? - That's right, owner-operate, gotta operate to own. Amen to that You're acting awful blue for the half owner of a brand new truck here. - You're not gonna spend more time with this rig than you are with me? That's not likely. You know what they say about drinking and driving. Then stop driving. This your bucket? Yep, 'til the bank says different. Hi honey, something I can do you for? I want to see Duane Haller. Hey Duane, somebody's here to see you. That's his office over there. He's pretty cute too. Hey CJ! Birdy, what's been happening? Oh nothing. - Hey that ain't the same old bunch of boys out on the dock there is it? It sure is. What happened to Jack? Died. You going for work. I hope so. - Hey listen kid, do like I do and keep your blinders on. And stay on the highroad you hear? - This ain't the ladies room, come on in. Well bless my ass, Carol Jo Hummer, you little son of a bitch you. How you doin Duane? - Well dang I've been expecting you since last Monday. - Oh the bank held me up, I got payments up the wazoo. Hell you getting fat Duane. Oh shut up, sit down and have a drink. Hey, tell me you got your papers. Old money. God damn, this is a nice rig. - At least it's mine, ran into Birdie outside, word is. Got a new bunch of boys working for me. They get the job done. Of course it ain't like it was when your daddy and me was driving. Just ain't been the same since he passed away. Hey you know what I got, I got you an Arizona special to Akron. I would appreciate it if somebody could find my secretary and send her into the office I have a little bit of work for her to do today. Here's a present for ya. What's this stuff? We ain't slated to haul cigarettes. - You ain't nothing but a little country boy. - You just gotta have a little more patience Pops. Look, I'll see if I can't slip a hall pass book to you later in the week. - Duane, don't you ever get tired of singing that same old song? Good god almighty, do my eyes deceive me? Where have they been keeping you boy? Up in the air Pops, how you been? Oh come see, come saw, mostly come saw. There's been lots of laying off around here. - Later Pops, I got business with Duane right now. I'll be across the way here, you know it's your obligation to by old Pops a drink. Come in. You know what's going on out there? The boys are packing contraband. Now what are you talking about son? Cigarettes, slot machines. Now what's wrong with that? That's just a little bit of untaxed tobacco out there. When did all this start Duane? Shoot, you gotta keep up son. What are you telling me? - I'm telling you heres a chance to pick up a little easy piece of change. Get something nice for Jerri. - Duane you know if they catch me hauling that stuff I'm liable to lose my license. Oh shit boy be sensible. There ain't nobody getting hurt out yonder except uncle sam, and hell he's getting too much already. - How bout you Duane, how much you getting? Now don't get hot with me boy. I ain't asking you to do a god damn thing that the rest of them ain't doing. We ain't trying to break the law, just bend it a little bit. That and a piece of change supposed to make it all right huh? Well it don't make it wrong. You know good paying work ain't that easy to come by. Duane, Duane, here you gotta- Yeah I know. I'm doing you a big damn favor just slotting you in here at all. - That mean I don't haul that stuff, I don't drive? That's right, just keep your mouth shut and do as you're told. - You know something Duane, I think you've gotten fat in the head too. Don't sass me you little son of a bitch. Let me tell you something, times has changed. You ain't gonna get any place pulling your fly boy heroics around here. Well I'll tell you what, times have changed but I have not. You can take that Arizona special and shove it right back up the cow's ass. You're about to walk off a cliff boy, there's a lot more to this than just you and me. Unload it, all of it! # Well I'm going where the water tastes like wine Hey pops. Whiskey and a brew. Hey you're new around here aren't ya? Something sure is. - And this wino was sitting right next to us and- - Here you go Pops, filling my obli-god damn-igation. - Oh you got your father's good taste in whiskey. Carnell, you remember Carol Jo don't ya? Yeah I remember him. Oh now cut that mess out. - Pops, you're not his Daddy's nigger no more, and I ain't gotta kiss his ass. Hey look man, the only thing that you and I have in common is that we're both competing for the same job. Understand? - And if you're waiting for an invitation, it ain't coming. Damn y'all. Don't pay no attention to those amateur mow mows. We got enough trouble around here without their foolishness. Well I'm finding out. - We're just shoving this shit back up the cow's ass, sugarplum. Hey you learned your lesson darlin, now why don't you go back to mommy and tell her when you growed up some, we'll let you play with the big trucks. Get your hand off my shoulder. What'd you say pardner? Well Mr. Carol Jo Hummer. I heard you were back. What is this Bob a social call? - Not really, I thought I'd just take a look at this new rig you've been bragging about. It's mighty nice, what it set you back? I'd rather not say right now. You in a hurry? No. - That's good cause I'd hate to have to give you a speeding ticket. Of course I could site you for using foul language over that two-way radio of yours, you know that don't ya? Improper inflation, now that's dangerous. You know better than that. 411 in progress at speedway- Well that's Momma calling. And when Momma calls I gotta come runnin. - What the hell are you doin Bob, you know me! Just hold it right there, you stay put. Pick him up. What you got? I got some apples and tangerines. I bet you got them hard apples. You know I hate em. Naw I got some soft ones for you, you can gum these. Yeah well get one out for me. Hey did I ever tell you the one about the peach picker. Oh yeah, you told me that. You know there was this peach picker, he was supposed to be the expert squeeze, and this farmer had this wife, she had tits on her as big as cantaloupe. Pops, I already heard this joke before. Wasn't it funny? Yeah it was funny. - Well what's wrong with hearing it a second time? It won't be funny a second time. Well why not? Because I already heard the joke. I know the punchline, there's not gonna be any surprise to it and I won't laugh. Why not? Because it won't be funny. - Look, I laugh at your jokes when you tell em. - Yeah well I'm not gonna laugh at this joke. Oh well I'm gonna tell it anyhow. This farming had his wife and she had - Titties on her as big as cantaloupe. I know already. - Yeah well I think you're losing your sense of humor. Yeah well I think you're getting senile. Watch your mouth boy. Isn't that Carol Jo's rig up there? - Hey Pops, let's just get out of here man. Whatever it is, it's between him and them, you ain't got nothing to do with it. I happen to like the kid alright. Buck. Business or broads? - Buck what the hell do you think you're doing? - Slow down, just slow down, don't get your bowels in an uproar. - Now what's the idea of busting that boys ribs? - Oh, Clem just kinda took it personal interest in that one's all. - Well damn it you've gone too far this time. What's eating you? Never bothered you them other times. Well hell, the boy's practically family, why me and his daddy- - Now I understand, I see what you're driving at. Now what do you figure those ribs is worth, one hundred, two hundred, now tell me Duane, 250? Duane? I don't think you oughta be socializing with that boy while he's nursing them ribs. - Private Bob Herps requested that one for Nadine. Makes that m'mm good truckers stew, and now for all you. Hummer! You're paid to work, relax on your own time! Another tough one huh? Mm hm. Damn supervisor, another speed up. Bitch doesn't know what she's doing. I just can't work that fast I mean she, come here honey. Come on Sadie, hello you're so lucky you don't have to work. It just gets too confusing around there. I gotta get a job where I can use my brain, this assembly line stuff. Oh spaghetti again. I'm going for work tomorrow. - Oh honey, the doctor said that you wouldn't be ready- - I don't give a damn what the doctor says, he doesn't have to come up with the two thousand dollar payment for the bank this month. - It's not gonna heal your ribs any faster. Hun look, if we lose that rig out there, we lose everything we've been hoping for. - You're not gonna go back to that place Red River are you? - Good paying work's more important right now. Not hungry huh? - Would the fella that came in on that rig from Kansas please report to the office. - Howdy. - Oh good mornin'. I hear you're hiring. Carol Jo Hummer, then you heard wrong. We ain't got no loads today. None all week. You know when you might be short? Sure don't. Thanks. - Howdy, I'm an owner operator looking for work. You've come to the right place mister, see Mr. Fogel in the corner office. - Will the owner of the 1966 Ramser station wagon please come to the secretary. Yes sir. - Yeah, I'd like to do something with my truck. Henry Fogel. Carol Jo Hummer. Oh well we only lease by the year. - Girl out there said you was looking for drivers. She don't run this company. Well who does? I do. I see. Hey, where's that trailer going? Dallas. Thanks. Well that's my ass, ain't that right Duane. Be careful with that god damn thing. Now look boy, I was a dirty son of a bitch that had them muss up your rig but never had nothing to do with the rest of that. You just sign me that Dallas load. I can't, Buck, they'll kill me. Who's Buck? Come on, higher, come on, higher. Hey you ain't got nothing there to be ashamed of. You wait outside for us will you Janie? Close the door. Who the hell are you? Give him the work order. Find a roost Duane. Sign it. Sign it! Alright boy, you want work? You got it. Set up the uh, what's the name of your rig? The Blue Mule. Set up the Blue Mule for Dallas. Now we pay on delivery. You're damn right you do. Up on the truck! Get down, come on move. Get over there, get! Get up! Against the beer, go on get up! You drive careful now, you hear? Let's go. - Looks like we got a visitor, silver Thunderbird. You gotta get out of state! What! - They got people all over, they'll be looking for ya! Not gonna be putting much stock in what you gotta say Duane! - Be careful boy, they're mean bastards, turn back! Aint likely! - Maybe we oughta call the police before for protection. - Old Buck's got enough protection already. - Hey I ever tell you the one about the peach picker? The farmer's wife with the jugs. What's going on? - I don't know, but I think we got company. Pops, get over here and do some driving. Be careful son. Well you have yourself a good time? - Not bad let's get going, we got a load to deliver. Oh man. - Ain't nothing wrong with the way you getting paid is it? - I don't know, it's just getting so there ain't enough pay anymore to keep on laying that old goat. Well everybody ain't lucky enough to enjoy his law and order. Adeline, I told you to hold my calls. Glass House on five Mr. Wessle. Thank you, you got Buck. Buck. - Could you hold on just minute Mr. Cutler. Get Clem in here. How are things at the house. - Fine, fine, what's going on up there Buck? That order of cigarettes ain't got to Galveston. You've never been late before. Now I hope it's nothing you can't handle. - Oh I can handle it, jigaboos and white trash is all, I'm getting on it right now. Yes sir, what we got here is a sure case of improper inflation. And I'm an expert on the subject. You truck drivers never learn. Now take this tire, now that's dangerous. Oh come on Bobby, those tires are fine and you damn well know it. - I sure do now don't you quote me on that. Ah, ah, ah, temper temper. You know Bob, it's people like you that give the police department a bad name. - Aint that the truth, well lookie who's here. Howdy Clem. Hey Bob, you know these peckerwoods left part of their load down by the road a piece. Thought we'd bring it to em. - That's mighty nice of you to help the boys out like that. Hey I got some stuff in the truck, you want to help me load it up. No you got your job and I got mine. What are you on a vacation? Alright that's enough. That's enough I said. Clem, I think it's time you went home. - What do you say we have a smoke on Buck Russel and the rest of them turkeys, huh? # You got to wait upon the darkness 'til mornin # Just to hold you tenderly # If you try to look in on your head # Somewhere my love is bound to be # Somewhere my love is bound to be You boys enjoying the party? Good, that's good. And this must be Mrs. Hummer. That's right. Come on let's play some pool. Hey you know that guy Buck is more afraid of you than you are of him. What you sitting over here moping about? Why don't you come over here and join us for a drink? Nigger's day in the sun huh Pops? - It's been 20 years coming and I aim to enjoy it. Even though he gave it to you? Oh even as particular as you is. You stupid old man! You think that he's gonna get you work? He's only gonna get you dead man. - He gots four balls, and up jumps this Scotsman and he says, walk proudly man, walk proudly. My ain't that formal attire. See I hate standing here, it's a hell of a place to hold meetings. What's all this you got over there Buck, some kind of rigger's revolution. - What I got up there is cigarettes and slots out the ass. First some hero, goodie goodie ain't trucking em, next thing you know, he's got niggers and crackers carrying on like they above the law. I tell you Duane's behind this. And Duane's running scared. He's got more respect for that old nigger than he has for the glass house. - Why don't you throw me the ball on this one? What do you got in mind Roy? Oh, little friendly persuasion. Buck, what did you say this hero's name was again? Hummer, Carol Jo Hummer. Honey, what college did I got to? You didn't. Pima, P, I, M, A. - You oughta be careful, they check on that sometimes. No, they never check. Previous experience, hm. Well what kind of previous experience you supposed to have to be a nursery school teacher? I don't know but you ain't got any. - I could say that I worked in an orphanage. Daycare center, say daycare center. Hello. Carol Jo, this is Duane. Hey something come up and old Buck and them's up in Scottsdale. Yeah what you got this time. It's a double rigger of Mexican avocados coming through here jack knife. They want to get somebody to haul em on in to Salt Lake City. It's plum whip cream. What kind of money we talking about? - Two grand and some change if you can land in there by tomorrow, pay on delivery. Better be on the level Duane. Oh, honest to god boy. Meet em out east on I-10. Tow will help you hook up. I promised them that you'd haul ass and get that stuff in there before it goes soft. Alright you got your boy. Hey have a good trip. Hey cowboy, you're all over the road. Little case of white light fever huh? Time for a coffee break? How far to the next truck stop? - You got a Triple J about a mile down the road. - He hun would you get me a cup of coffee to go, in a great big hurry. You betcha. What are ya carrying. I got five thousand pounds of avocados I gotta get into Salt Lake City by noon tomorrow, or else tonight's just a big sight seeing tour. - Damn brother, someone's sure busting your balls. - Well I ain't got me no inherence you know. - Uncle Sam's not gonna give you one either. He sure ain't. Here you go Carol Jo. You Hummer? Mm hm. Well it's on my Hummer. Thank you. See you later. - You haven't told CJ about this, huh? No, please don't tell him Jamie. The last thing I need is him working 20 hours a day, seven days a week and that's exactly what he's gonna do when he finds out. - Sooner or later you gotta tell him, you know that. - I want to borrow some money from you Jamie. I think that I want to get an abortion. And I think it's the best thing. There's a lots of time for us to have a family. Just gonna have to wait 'til things get better. See if I have the baby, I'm gonna have to quit my job. Now how am I gonna get by if I'm not working. You can't do this all by yourself. You've got to talk to CJ about it. See if I tell Carol Jo, he's gonna want to keep the baby. He wants a family so bad. And now is just not the right time. I'm not gonna have him on the road all the time. Hi, how are you doin? About a half an hour late aren't ya? I've been pushing he awful hard. Still pretty good time. Like them avocados huh? I can't stand em myself. My wife, she likes em, she makes that green Mexican stuff put them Fritos in, tastes like green piss to me. Hey Joe Bob, get a load of this. - Damn they must've been picked a year ago. What a waste of diesel. I don't know what Duane's doing down there. Oh Duane watch the road! Goodnight! Oh I'd rather watch you sugar. Hey, you know what I got for you? No what you got for me? Lemme show ya. Oh Duane jeez. How about that? You know I'm on a diet. All the way from Europe. Well big deal, that won't make it good. No but it sure makes it expensive. - The insides is good, the rest just tastes like old car seat. That's the biggest cherry I ever ate. Hey you still got your cherry? Oh Duane. I bet you got the box it come in. Hey, tell me honey, why'd you bring me clear out here? - What's a matter Duane, don't you like surprises? I sure do. Well it's gonna be a real surprise. God damn. - Those guys don't seem to know what they're doing, do they? It's a god damn convention. - Come on Duane why don't you just pull over and stop? Have another on the house. Alright. Hey how'd it go man? Well they set me up. Oh what happened? - 30 hours hauling rotten produce for nothing, and I sucked it up like a two bit turkey. Oh god, why don't you go on home? - I ain't leaving here 'til I see Duane Haller. Jerri thinks I'm coming home with two thousand dollars in my pocket, I got nothin. I thought that fat son of a bitch was a friend of mine. Come on CJ let's go home. Jerri's waiting to talk to you and you need some rest. I ain't going. Come on it's no good- Deputy Sheriff, you're under arrest. Aw what is it this time Bob? - Get back, hands on the bar, spread your legs. What the hell is this? Head on the bar. You're under arrest for the murder of Duane Haller. What the hell are you crazy! And we got an eye-witness. Carol Jo, I brought you a lawyer, this is Boyd Agnes, you know he won that big case up in Prescott. - Might as well give a listen to what I have to say Hummer? Looks son, for the money we're paying, Perry Mason ain't likely to walk through that door. - Talked to the scum that calls himself a public prosecutor, wants to make a deal with you Hummer. Says he'll get the grand jury to indite you on involuntary man slaughter, means you'll spend six months chucking bricks on the county farm. But if you ain't buying that, you're looking at murder one. And that means thirty years punching license plates at Florence. What about the trial? Well that comes after the grand jury sets down the indictment. But let me tell you, you've got an ice cube's chance in hell of getting justice in that court. The last thing they want is your ass back on that highway organizing them drivers. - What the hell you talking about organizing? It ain't gonna do no one no good you going to jail for 30 years, least of all me. - If I go away for six months, we can forget about the family and everything else we've been planning. The bank ain't gonna wait. - The bank, you're talking as if the bank runs our lives. Well don't they? No they don't. Just take the deal, please, take the deal and let's get the hell away from here. - There's a lot more to this than just what happens to us. What about this grand jury, are they like a regular jury? - 16 of your peers, signed, sealed, and delivered. Just like the constitution says. - In your practical opinion, Mr. Davidson, you would say that Mr. Hummer had been drinking long before he entered the bar where you were? I certainly would. - And once again, he was speaking threateningly of Mr. Haller. That's what I said. Thank you. Mrs. Fore lady, and members of the jury. You heard four witnesses who saw Mr. Hummer enter Duane Haller's office with a gun, you've heard the arresting officer's testimony as to the violent nature of Mr. Hummer, and you just heard that he had been drinking heavily on that evening. Now we will present an eyewitness who saw Duane Haller run down by the accuser. You saw the running down of Duane Haller did you not? I did sir. - How did you happen to be on that stretch of the road, that afternoon. - Oh I recently received a rather large inheritance, and I was investigating the land in your area for potential investment. Describe what you saw. Man was trying to fix a flat tire, and as he was waving down a truck to give him a hand he stepped out onto the road and the truck ran right into him and continued on the road. What did you do? - Well I made a mental note of the license number and then I went directly to the police. It was obvious there was no helping the poor man. Can you identify these photos? - Well this looks like the man with the flat tire. And that is definitely the truck that ran him over, I couldn't help but not the name. Thank you Mr. Miller, you may step down. - I think I'd like to ask Mr. Miller a question or two. What kind of property around here were you looking for, Mr. Miller? I was looking at land primarily as an investment for the future. - I hasten to remind our distinguished Fore lady that the purpose of this proceeding is not to establish the guilt or innocence of the accused, but rather to determine whether or not there is probable cause to warrant a trial. Finally we will call Mrs. Hummer to the stand. - Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth so help you god? I do. Please be seated. I remind you, that Mrs. Hummer was told that she did not have to testify against her husband. Now Mrs. Hummer, all of us understand how difficult it is for you to give evidence, and the court appreciates your desire to get all the facts out. No matter how painful they might be. In your own words, will you tell us about the phone conversation between Duane Haller and your husband. Duane called, offered Carol Jo- - Excuse me Mrs. Hummer, speak up please Mrs. Hummer, so the jury can hear you. - Duane called and offered Carol Jo a load, cause a rig jack knifed down the road and they needed someone to drive it on through. - What exactly did your husband say? - He said that Duane better be on the level. Those were his exact words? - Well I can only tell you what I heard. Just a simple yes or no. Yes. Thank you. My husband didn't kill anybody, he didn't kill Duane. Carol Jo had a right to be wary of Duane. It was Duane who had Carol Jo come to him in the first place for a job and when he came home it was with busted ribs, he couldn't work and I was working double shifts and- Thank you Mrs. Hummer. - Please, I'd like to say something else if I can. Certainly, go right ahead. - See I didn't want this, I didn't want to come here. I didn't want this in the first place. See they offered Carol Jo a deal that if he went to jail for six months, then we could leave here and we could start our family elsewhere. That's what I wanted. But you see Carol Jo, he figured that six months or 30 years it wouldn't make a difference to them. They wanted him so bad, they wouldn't quit until they had him in a place where he couldn't fight back. - Melville, you big son of a jackass! Melville. - Hey Pops this is Brady, Carol Jo is free! He's free! What's that about Hummer? He's free! My boy Carol Jo is free! They didn't believe them lies! Amen to that. Grand jury didn't indict him! Carol Jo's outta jail! He's free, he's outta jail! Honk your horns for Hummer! He's free he's free! Go get em Carol Jo! Alright what is it? - You were lucky today Carol Jo, damn lucky. I was innocent. - Christ, who do you think got you off, the tooth fairy? The truth got me off. I got you off! And next time you might not just be so lucky! I ain't looking forward to raising our kid alone. - Don't you understand that we're finally making a place for ourselves with all that happened here today? We have a place for ourselves! Being together and raising a family was what was most important to us! - Still is. - Is it? Hell yes it is! Look, I don't want to raise our kids knowing that their daddy left a fight half fought. - You're just so damned impressed with yourself, you can't even hear what I'm saying! Well what the hell are you saying? Stop the car. Will you quit acting so damn crazy? - Stop the car, I said, I don't want to be with you. Stop the god damn car! Get in here. Damn it I said get in here. - Why don't you get out here and kick my ass, that seems to be your style. Watch the car Buck. Now y'all are blowing my game, I got a five hundred buck national going with the governor's nephew. Well Roy almost blew our game today- - That's not what's cross, I scraped our cathouses clean and lined up a bunch of cow brains for the jury, but Norm here couldn't even get his story straight. - No wait a minute Roy, it wasn't my idea to put that Hummer lady up on the stand. - Shut up. - Who the hell are you? - You remember Norm, he was a witness for us in the Montana case. Get him outta here. - Wait a minute, this isn't getting us anywhere. Look, we got a problem. - Yeah, pretty soon every trucker's gonna start believing in a god damn union. - They all think they have a god given right to haul what they want to, when they want to. This is gonna give the green light to a lotta horse's asses think they can run their business without dealing with the Glass House. - Alright, fellas this Hummer business has gone far enough. I'm sorry. I know things must've been pretty awful in jail. Yeah. I've always thought of myself as a strong man, I can't be fighting the whole world and you at the same time. I know, and I don't mean it to be that way, I just- You don't have to say anything. I do. I'm pregnant Carol Jo. And I've been thinking I wish I weren't. - I was always planning on having a family. Just getting started a little bit early, that's all. Money will come. - I'm just not gonna have you working all the time. - Bank ain't gonna keep me away from you and our family. I don't give a damn if I'm in debt 'til the day I die. - Hey Buck, I wouldn't have brought my girl to this party, had I known there was gonna be a tar baby coming. - Hell I think I know why he's here. Revenge. Ain't that right boy. Yeah, only we call it justice. - Gentlemen of the road, before you go jumping to any conclusions, lets take a look at the facts. Fact one, we're responsible for more housing development and land reclamation in this here area and a lot of outfits that you think are real big. Fact two, you can't drive down a highway- - Could you spare a few words in private Mr. Hummer? Sure. - That hasn't been partially paid for by this here company. Fact three, our interest in oils and minerals help keep your trucks moving on down the road I can say. - Well I admire the way you handled Buck and his boys, they play rough. So can we. - Clearly Mr. Hummer, that's why we'd like to offer you a proposition. - Well we came here to talk to you Mr. Cutler. That you will. But hear me out. We had a very profitable arrangement with Buck, and would like to see the same kind of thing with you. I can tell you it'd be very beneficial to your drivers. Now don't decide right a way, why don't you stay here with us for a few days, get to know some of the boys, and gals. - I believe I've already decided Mr. Cutler. - You're a very charismatic man, Mr. Hummer, what you want is going to go a long way in deciding what they want. Remember at the Glass House you'll be in a position to help truck drivers all over the state, you get my meaning? - We know the things you have to have to have the good life. You take your children, you want to send them on to college. Name any school house in America, I think we can offer you some additional advantages other than what I've already discussed with you. First we got a- Hold it a minute Hyde. - We all came here today to tell these fellas to stay the hell out of our business. That we want to make our livins without anyone from the state, Uncle Sam, or the Glass House telling use what to do. But Mr. Cutler here has seen fit to offer me a job, because he feels that I have some influence over you. So I'm asking you, do we want to go to work for the Glass House and surely make a lot of money, or do we want to work for ourselves and take our chances? I guess you all know what mind I'm of. Anybody here feels any different now's the time to speak up. - Well gentlemen, it's a big state, 14 counties. I don't suppose it would hurt very much if we was only operating in 13 of them. - We don't aim to go into competition with you Mr. Cutler. - You're a fine sensible man Mr. Hummer, I can see that. There won't be anymore Buck Wessels, I can assure you. And remember, our door will always be open for you here at the Glass House. - I almost wallpapered the wall with your head. - Next time I'll throw my hat in the door first. Any trouble? Nah. - So tell me, they give the hero a big welcome? Red carpet treatment. That don't mean much. - That don't mean shit, I know that bunch of scum will slip another Buck Wessel on us. That don't mean they're gonna mess with us though. - And what about me, can I still mess with you? Anytime you want. - Dr. R A Smith to geriatrics please. Jerri. Honey. - Mr. Hummer, I think you should speak with the doctor. - Mr. Hummer you were advised to talk to me before you went in to see your wife. I don't need no permit to see my wife. But we could've explained. You see she's under heavy sedation now, but we do expect that she'll be able to lead a normal life. The baby aborted. I'm sorry, but I'm afraid that your wife is not going to be able to have any more children. Deputy Dog, you know who this is. You call em and tell and tell em I'm coming hear? - This is mobile two five, to two one three four eight, four eight. Yeah, sorry about your car Bob. Dusty what are my appointments. The usual with Roy this evening, I've confirmed your reservation. And with Joe Dante at five. - That's fine, get Sam Nedrose, tell him I have Tucson troubles on the way, tell him to get on it and take care of it personal. And honey, be sure and tell Sam I said personal, got that? - Gentlemen, you're standing in front of 30 million dollars of private property. You're here to protect it. Now when that truck comes down that drive it's trespassing, anything you do is then is legal, stop him, do whatever it takes, take your positions. - Here's to money and love and the time to enjoy it. - On a normal day this truck stop would be loaded with the big diesels carrying food to the markets, steel to the factories, lumber to the mills and more. But this is not a normal day. Today Arizona's truckers are on strike. But they're not on strike for wages or for hours or for benefits, they're on strike for a man. Carol Jo Hummer. Listen, lets go outside for a minute, there's something you oughta see. # Long lonely years here without you # Long years to call out your name # Wandered alone through the desert # Lord how I've prayed for the rain # Long years and finally it came # Darling it's so good hold you again # Fear was my constant companion # Holding me sleepless each night # Memories danced in the shadows # Cast by the first rays of light # How can you hold a shadow tight # Wanted to hold you with all of my might # Friends and neighbors came to call # Found me staring at your picture on the wall # They would talk to me like old friends do # But I was drifting and dreaming of you # Drifting and dreaming # Drifting and dreaming # Drifting and dreaming # Drifting and dreaming # But I was drifting and dreaming of you
