Autumn 1977. Somewhere in Eastern Slovakia... Do not hurt me! Let me go! She's a freak... That's all she is! I want a son! You understand? My son! No! Leave me alone! Write me... Lea... What's she writing? Poems. Poems? Yes... to her dead mother. Very beautiful poems. Listen... This thing with her speech... Will it pass? It's too early to say right now. I hope it's only a temporary shock. Beno Gahut was sentenced yesterday to life imprisonment... for the murder of his wife... and the severe shock damage caused to her daughter. The child was placed under the guardianship of their neighbor, Palty. A van with bars, a man's sad face, the father. Riding through a snowstorm, vanishing from sight, a black cat hurries across the street. Don't be afraid... He will never come back. 14 years later, autumn 1991... Horse dealer called. He'll be here already on Saturday. You go with him... That's it! Saturday...? But you know... I don't care... If you don't like it here, you can leave. Join the freaks in the circus! That's where you belong anyway! You know, she has to... - She doesn't have to do anything! I don't I pay her to talk to the dead! You'd still be in the nut-house, if it weren't for me! Don't forget that! Midnight, a dark dream, a vampire at my back, a mask on his face - a laughing clown, he tastes my blood my blood, the night, covering my eyes with a clown's cap. Go ahead! I'll come later. New guest? A German... restores furniture. Turned up at the land registry office last month. Smells like restitution. Why? His name is Strehlow... His parents lived around here somewhere. Big landowners. After the war they emigrated. Probably looking to cash out. What do you want here? Your daughter? Yes... What's her name? Lea... Why? What do you want here? Looking for a bride... Exactly like her. I want to marry her. Are you crazy? You... can't just... like that... Who are you? I'll take her to Germany. What's she worth to you? My daughter is not a horse! If you back here... Get lost! 50,000... Deutsche mark. Or you can get twenty horses. That's 200,000. I'll be back in three days. Make sure she comes. So much money... My god... But... after all... She's grown-up now... Maybe she'll leave us... Get married... Maybe... Who knows... maybe, that's just her type. They're both... I mean it's not like she's our flesh and blood. You know I wouldn't... What do you say? How will you get her to do it? That German... you know... He's looking for people to work for him. In Germany. He's offering you work... Yes... He's offering you work. You'll make a lot of money with him. Ten times more than here... Deutsche mark. Yon can always come back, if you don't like it there. Everyone wants work in the West. Here's your big chance... Grab it! Leave it... leave it... I'll do that. Take the day off... Enjoy yourself. Go on... Go! What are you waiting for? Hundred thousand... Tough... All this land and the woods belongs to me. Be glad you have such a daughter. But that... -Fifty thousand. Cash. If she comes with me, I'll drop the claim. You can have it. And if not? You're homeless. My claim was granted yesterday. The day after tomorrow at nine. At the hotel. With the daughter. This, this... can't be true! It's a fraud! The day after tomorrow at nine. But... You don't know... Lea is silent. Shock from childhood. She can not speak... only a little. Doesn't matter. Neither can I. Open the door. Lea, open the door! Do you hear me? You're taking that job with the German! If you don't... you'll never go to the "Semljanka" again. I'll bury it and... Bring the urn to the cemetery! He is a furniture restorer. You'll have a job in his workshop. You're so good with your hands. Be reasonable! Our door is always open... But now you have to go with him! Your mother would want that too. Tomorrow, then... Jakub... the letters... don't forget... the letters. Stop it. Firewood for a week, I said, not a century! Pack yourself a few things. We're going away... far away. Open it. We're getting married. It's easier here. No paperwork and crap like in Germany. Over and done in five minutes. No... I want to marry... please... Your old man got fifty thousand for you. 50,000 marks. Understand? You're my bride... Didn't he tell you that? He conned you, your old man. Tomorrow. Look your best! He's... not... my... father. We're marrying anyway. Who is he, this one here, my master? Golden ring, white dream, black shadows as they dance in the room... breathing so hard, this one here... really my master? Do you take-Lea Palty to be your lawful wedded wife? Do you take Herbert Strehlow to be your lawful wedded husband? I now pronounce you man and wife. May I congratulate...? Think you can fix it? Your niece? My wife. Strehlow... congratulations. A beautiful woman... Rather young, isn't she? Twenty one. An artist? Looks like it. Magnificent piece, don't you think? See the crack? Butcher... Repeat: Butcher. Cut the crap! You're not that dumb. Good day, Strehlow. Good day, madam. Stamps... buy... You have to earn them first, your stamps. For every word you say, you get one. Inhaling rage, my master spitting fire, funny he is, my little monster. Excuse me, my master, but it just happens as such, that I still do not know, why you love me so much. Who is Jakub Palty? No more stamps! No paint! No nothing! House arrest! We'll work it out. You certainly have a golden touch, Strehlow. People say strange things about you. About your past. You keep to yourself too much. People here don't like that. Especially now... that you have such a beautiful wife... Yesterday, at the post office she sent 45 letters. Gossip, I take it... or? All of them, to one person in Slovakia! That'll be thirteen hundred. Good day. Are you a translator for Slovak? I want to meet you... I'll be there tomorrow at twelve. I'll explain that... later. Yes... Okay... three o'clock... Got it... Strehlow. No. S t r e h l o w... Doesn't matter... Goodbye. Good day. Two seventy. Keep it... The letter from my wife... I need it back. Sssorry... I can't dddoo that. It's already pppostmarked. You understand? Understand me now? Sssorry... The line was bbbusy. Roast duck tonight! Pluck it! Sophie... my wife... Don't touch that album ever again. Understand? Understand...? Understand? You really want me to translate all of these? Sure... Why? Your wife has a keen sense of humor... And a lot of talent. Beautiful poems... Love poems? Some of them... Love poems to her mother. What? Her mother? Are you disappointed or relieved? Listen, I'm not paying you to ask stupid questions! When can I have them? Come back in two weeks. Mr. Strehlow... Do you know your wife's favorite flower? Wild roses... Thanks... It's that simple. One word... one stamp. Please... Bravo! Magnificent! Leave the violin here! I'll buy it... You know, Strehlow, it's a precious piece... 70 years old. Not cheap. How much? It's worth thirty thousand at least. Bring it around tomorrow. And don't forget the bow. Play, I said. From now on, you play whenever I work. All right? Go on! Only the grass asks, why I don't laugh. Only the grass asks, why I don't hope. Only the grass, asks, why I dance with the dead behind the reed. Only the grass asks, why I plant wild roses in the desert. Only the grass asks... Do you like it? I don't understand much about poetry... What a shame... There are certain things you really ought to know. Here. When did her mother die? Die? She's dead? What makes you say that? The secret of poetry... Mr. Strehlow... When was the last time your wife laughed? When a woman laughs, you have her in the palm of your hand... A Slovak saying... Think about it. Your real mother... Is she dead? Illness? Killed... by my father... with this. It's cold in the chapel. You can write here. The tongue runs red with venomous blood. The mouth spits deadly fire. Causing a wave of burning ash. I dream the dark cobwebs... that hide handsome monsters. What's wrong? Headache? Gone... all gone. Good day. How are you? I've been wanting to meet you... I translated your poems into German. My name is Wanda. I live in Munich. My mother was Slovak. Where...? Your husband brought them to me. Your poems are beautiful. Good day, Mr. Strehlow. Here is the rest... Very lovely, your wife. That's why I married her. See him walking, my master, the bear. Grumpy, as usual. I wonder why he never laughs, this bear, my master? A personal gift from General Duchamp. When I left the Foreign Legion. That gold medal is for the best marksman. I was a champion for ten years. Twenty years of war. Every day... Somewhere in the world. This grumpy bear forgot how to laugh. Sophie... dead? Car accident. In France. On our honeymoon. I signed up after that. It was the best remedy. Stop it! Stop it... I said! Let's go to your village for a couple of days... Snow's coming. It might be nice there. God... I'll be damned! Why didn't you ever write to us? You look good! What a beautiful woman you are. Wait! You can stay with us. We done up the whole house. Thank you... Jakub... thank you. This is my window. Just now I was so gently awakened. I thought I would be floating. How far my life is stretching, and where does night begin? Have you ever seen the ocean? Want to? Lea... what is it? What's wrong? Tests were negative. Everything looks normal. You can rest at ease. But what causes these attacks? Look, it could be psychosomatic... Something triggered by her speech impediment. In any case, I would advise you to visit a psychotherapist. Bullshit! That's the last thing she needs! They need their heads examined! It's up to you. But maybe you should let your wife decide that. Good-bye, Mr. Strehlow. You know what she needs? Stamps. -Stamps? Yes, stamps... Ordinary stamps. Then she talks like a waterfall. They... are... from... there... Thank you. Is it the same with everyone, that they do not even know, the very drift of their dreams, when they open their eyes to dream... I'm glad you're back. See him walking, my master, the bear... See him walking, my master, the bear... Grumpy, as usual... Grumpy, as usual... I wonder... why he never laughs... I wonder... why he never laughs... this bear, my master? Pull it! Come... For you... Your birthday present. Snow... Hot... snow... Mr. Strehlow... Your wife had a massive stroke. There was nothing more we could do for her. She died a few minutes ago... Come with me. I'll give you an injection. I don't want an injection! I want my wife back!
