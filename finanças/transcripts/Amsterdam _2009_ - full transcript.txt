I hate kids. I'd watch my wallet if I were you. -I'm no like you, George. Watch your money, Philip. -I trust him. Trust? Why is he making life so hard on us? He's having a hard time. -He needs to go in therapy. Are you crazy? No way. -I was just kidding. Let's just enjoy our holiday. Tomorrow we're going to town. -No. Come with me. -I want to go to the beach. But why? No, don't go. Don't go. Never go away. Did mom go to bed? Yes. She wasn't about to wait up for you. And Roos? -I don't know. She's no home yet. Did you kill somebody? -I don't know. I didn't wait around. Is this all? -Yes, for a golden Rolex. Agolden Rolex? You go a lousy deal. Tell that to fucking Khaled. -I definitely will. Dickhead. Khaled called you a lazy bastard. This lazy bastard stole a Porsche this evening. I'm going to sell it to Wiillem myself tomorrow. Khaled closes all the deals. -But not this one. If it works, we dump him. We dump him? That's a nice dream. -Definitely. A very beautiful dream. -And will it ever come true? I hope so. I hope so too. Then you'll finally get out of this crooked world. Forever. -Thanks. And you're going to be a respectable man. Yes, and rich. Filthy rich. -I'll buy you a house. Don't even think about it. -Why no?

No, I don't like very special surprises either. I think she's in love. But not with Khaled. Okay, I'll meet you tonight at seven in the bar. Why? Because I'm fucking busy, that's why. What are you so fucking busy with? Leave me alone. What can she be doing? Beats me. What's going on? -Jaap killed his wife. Really? -Yes, with a kitchen knife. He called the police himself. Yes, that sucks. Come. They never see what they're supposed to see. And how was your day? Better than Jaap's. Thank goodness. I'm going to propose to Roos today. -Really? So it's finally going to happen? -Yes. Then everything will be different. -Yes. Everything will be different. wanted Today will be a very special day. Abdul sends you his love. He went straight to the police for help. They will take care of him, and find Khaled. It's gorgeous. Yes? Do you want to marry me? You shouldn't ask me that, Khaled. I'm no in love with you. -That's okay. Are you so sure about that? -Yes. I have big plans for us. Yes, I'm sure, but how can I love an illegal criminal with no future? Please, Roos. One thing at a time. I've go a plan. -Yes, I've heard. If I marry you, you get a Dutch passport. Yes, and then I can start my own business. You'll be amazed. -Forget it, Khaled. Marry somebody else. To tell you the truth... I'm in love with somebody else. Who? -You don't know him. What is this bullshit? -lt isn't bullshit. Don't be ridiculous. -He lives in New York. He's here on holiday. -You're kidding me. No, no at all. You're in love with a New Yorker? -Yes, a charming one. Does this New Yorker care as much about you as I do? Stop it. -Would he steal for you, as I do? He doesn't have to because he's filthy rich. I have to go. Come on. -Wiillem didn't care who sold him the car. Khaled was lying. -I told you so. He said he preferred doing business with me. He did? Why? -Because we understand each oher. We should have killed that fucking Khaled. Shut up. -I'm just saying... I don't know where she is. In the bar with Khaled, I think. Damn. What's going on here? Move it. -I'm stuck in traffic. What's this? -What are you looking at? What do you want? -Assholes. Bitch. -I'll shove this down your throat. Shut your fucking face. -What's wrong? What are we going to do now? Do you have your knife with you? What do you think? Nobody knows him, so nobody will miss him. You're forgetting the two faggots. -Do you think they'll report him missing? Okay, you're right. Let's meet him in the garage. Mrs Stout? -Yes. Could we talk to your daughter, please? My daughter? Why? -ls this her phone number? Yes, that's right. -Is she at home? No, what's going on? -Do you know this young man? No, absolutely not. We found your daughter's number at his home. That's possible. My daughter has many admirers. Tell her to come to the Marnixstraat station to answer some questions. Yes, of course. I'll tell her. Thanks. My dear, can I give you some advice? -Yes, go ahead. Roos. Forget Roos. Impossible. Find a new girlfriend so you can forget about her. That would be even harder. -lt wouldn't be easy for me. What? To find somebody else. But you... You're still beautiful and young. And a criminal without a residence permit. Don't say that. Hello, friends. Salaam. Hi, babe. -Stop it. I had an argument... -We're talking. Why did you come back so quickly? -I had an argument. Shut up. Hallo, Mimoun. -Damn. I've had enough. Are you crazy? I'm sick of this Moroccan negro. Find a decent guy. You impoent swine. Watch your mouth. Come back. What a mess. Shit. Do you know Khaled? Where could this dickhead be? I don't even know where he lives. He's probably having a cry with his gay friends. Where's Hannah? -What do I care? Have you been drinking? -Yes, I have. So? Where have you been? Did you prostitute yourself in Amsterdam? I wish I were a whore. At least I'd get fucked every now then. Come on, be quiet. I'm not shutting up this time. Why don't you fuck me? Shut your trap. -Don't talk to me like that. Just fuck me. Shut your gob. Are you deaf? Listen to me. -Shut your gob. The sexy guy is furious. -What a dick. He's a real man. -So why don't you fuck me anymore? Shut up. -I can't take it anymore. Why don't you fuck me anymore? -Shut up. Is there a problem? Do something for me for a change. -I'm going to bed. No, let's join them together. -Are you nuts? They're faggots. Yes, so what? -They won't fuck you in the ass. They're inviting us over for a drink. I'm drinking my own beer. -No, do it for me. Yes, alright. Fine. Just hold on a minute. No fucking Khaled. What do you think a caravan is worth? We don't have time. -We'll make time. We'll nail Khaled later on. I'm sorry. Please, never say that again. Do you hear me? Never again. What are you doing? Stop that nonsense. -This is no nonsense. I've had enough for today. The police are looking for you and you gave them our names. That's bullshit, Sjaak. Why don't you come along with us? Take it easy, Sjaak. Are we going to the garage? -No idea. We're going towards the end of your fucking life. 'lt All Began in the City of Love.' 'Are you Prepared?' I did more than just scrub the decks. We have to go. -Yes, of course. Come. Holy shit. Where's Hannah? -Beats me. That's no possible. -Why no? I destroyed hers. I'm sorry. If you let us go, I'll disappear. You'll never see me again. Forget it. You're boh going to die. Day 4 Khaled, come here. You look like shit. Hurry. The police are looking for you. Hurry. I have a picture. That's him. No, no my money. Why? Why? Why? What? Shit, shit. The caravan. Shit Moroccan. Shit Holland. Damn shit. This is shit. Take good care of yourself. -Yes, you too. I wish you all the best. -You too. Bye, old man. He has no papers. They're taking everything, aren't they? -Yes. Thanks to Johnny. He told them everything right away, damn. That weak bastard. I still care about him. I'm sure he's gone forever. I knew nothing about this. -Wiillem is going to kill me. Willem? What do I care about this Wiillem? What are you talking about? Khaled is relaxing somewhere, laughing at us. Do you want to call dad? -Don't talk to me about him. Did I fall in love with the wrong man? You've always said that you didn't love him. I'm not talking about Khaled. They're done. We can go home. When? -Today. That's good news. What happened here? -Where have you been all night? I've been worried sick. I didn't sleep a wink. Sure you were. -I was so... Sure you were. -What do you mean? Where were you? Sure you were. -Stop that. What do we tell our friends? -The truth. Your caravan is gone? I can't call them. -It's all my fault. No more Holland. -It's all my fault. I slept in a hoel. -Madam slept in a hoel? Madam slept... What do you mean? With who and why? Answer me. Why and with who? -Alone, alright? Alone? As if you're going to spend a night in a hoel alone. Have you gone crazy? Answer me. That shit Moroccan. -I talked you into it. It's no your fault. -Yes, it is. Stop it. Hannah should have... -Don't shout. Mom. -What, mom? She thinks Khaled is innocent and I believe her. He liked her a lot. He gave herthat expensive necklace. Damn Moroccan thief. I may... -Say something. I may get married to Khaled. -You're not going to do that. Forget about it. I won't have him in here. We're going to forget about Khaled. You're going to marry... a decent, rich, kind man. That's what you've promised me. Day 5 In the name of God. Pray for him. In the name of God. May God have mercy on this man and on us. Every soul will perish. Only the Eternal One remains and doesn't die. God is the greatest. May God's peace and blessing be with you. Let me look at you. You've become a man. Mama will take care of you. That's all she wants. Always remember that I went away to try and take care of all of you. I know.
