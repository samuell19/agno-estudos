Help, help, he's raping me! - Rasmussen! - I'm coming, overconstable. Help! Mom... Just take it easy, sir. I'll get her. Stop or I'll shoot! Hands up! Rasmussen... Rasmussen?! OLE EGE films Brothel A happy girl's memories Brothel Signs of Joy by Lonny Feddersen Signs of Joy The forest was dressed in late summer colors. The roses bloomed... ...the birds chirping, everything breathed peace and quiet. It was like in paradise. I had just turned 16, and felt how my body slowly changed. I was becoming a young woman. I started with longing, waiting for the month of October. I was both happy and uncertain when I would leave the village. But I had to go. I had discovered that my... ...nipples stiffened and a sucking sensation went through... ...my stomach and womb, when young men looked at me. I needed to try my fortune in the big city. I arrived in Copenhagen the next day. On the broad street, ...horse carts and many people were on the road to Tivoli. What a great and wonderful city. There was the National Scala, which I had seen pictures of the newspaper,... ...with people who danced and enjoyed themselves. Next to Tivoli was a small theater called "Kisten". It was a pretty funny name. On the placards I could see that Mrs Hansen was prima donna. At the Town Hall Square and the shopping street there was a crowd so fierce... ...that you could lose yourself. Here I met a nice older gentleman who asked if I wanted to see the movie. I said yes, it was a place called "Kinografen". We saw a film about Christian IX's funeral in the castle church. It was great, classy and very moving. I was a bit scared when the gentleman brought his hand under his cloak... ...and took on my tender breasts. Afterwards we ate and strolled along the shopping street, when he suddenly... ...pointed to a side street and said: "I'll show the little lady something. " We went to a party, and before I had time, I had... ...his penis in my hand. Suddenly white fluid flowed from it. He smiled, snapped up his trousers and put an whole penny in my hand When I came out of the gate, I found myself on Br?ndstr?derne... ...and what crowds there were. There sat lush ladies with almost bare breasts in the windows. They smiled and waved at the men who passed by. Someone said, "Can I help you Little Friend," or "the young flower. " I gripped my penny and went into a cafe for a coffee. After a while a lady named Fut-Kirsten approached me. I told her I was looking for work as kitchen help. She knew about a job in the house where her sister Anna worked. Of an elder gentleman by the name of Julius Gynther Jespersen. She showed me a picture of Anna and Julius... ...and a whole harem of beautiful girls. He was proud of his collection and got them immortalized... ...by a skilled photographer. My friend, Fut-Kirsten, told the whole story... Such happiness cannot be eternal... Anna told still on Julius peculiarities. Hereby I declare that my house and what there belongs... ...of people and equipment, shall fall to my two sons. The rightful heir is the one of the two,... ...who first arrives at the lawyer's office in Copenhagen... ...and demands the heritage. It should be said that in the house is a precious diamond,... ...a genuine Karador. Once sold this would bring in enough money... ...that the house would be paid off for years... Julius' two sons had long since left Denmark. The eldest had for many years waged a war between... the flesh... and belief in God. He was now a Mormon priest in Utah... Letter to you, Parson. Thank you, my boy. The priest had enough problems before. Two wives and their own parish. And now a letter brought him back 20 years in time... ...to a father who suddenly was alive again. But this turned out to be a will from a lawyer... The youngest son had quite different problems. A battle for a Romanian princess had now led to a duel. As a second he had his oldest friend, Ramon of Krakow. He told Ramon about about the legacy and the diamond... ...just in case he should die in the duel. Ramon was an adventurer with precious stones as a specialty. Ramon realized that the diamond would clear his friend's guilt and honor. But Ramon was not the only one who had Copenhagen in sight. Over Utah's mountains broke a black clad rider. The Mormon priest had made his decision. I was so engrossed in the adventure, that I went immediately to... ...the address Fut-Kirsten gave me, to meet my new mistress. - Thank you for trying to help me. - You can trust me... So I ended up in the house in Charlottenlund. Not in the kitchen chamber, which I expected, but in spacious rooms. When I stepped into my room and saw the flowers, and the fine... ...bed and the mirrors... Well then my legs wouldn't carry me anymore. I laid myself down... and fell asleep. But already in the first evening there was noticeable excitement in the house. The girls were preparing something I I would probably participate in. Something secret, I understood. Meanwhile, police in Copenhagen were on the highest alert. A prisoner named Smoking Thomas, was housed in the city Smoking Thomas was strikingly similar to Ramon of Krakow. From police headquarters Sorensen and Rasmussen ...had received alerts and inquiries. They were now looking to do their duty. - Rasmussen, this way. - Yes, overconstable. Having been initiated into this secret ritual,... ...my life was changed completely. I had never heard of girls who loved each other... ...and could never imagine that it would be so nice - Rasmussen! - Yes, overconstable. There is a mysterious person. We must be on our guard. - Rasmussen, come here! - I'm coming. Quickly... Read this, it's him. What do we do now? - Follow him, Rasmussen. - Yes, overconstable. Be careful. We must strike at the right time. HALT... STOP... You skunk... Stop in the name of the law! It is forbidden to ride here! After him! Faster! Sooner or later, all criminals are caught. I am a... Now write in there, so the "girls home" is yours. My name is there Thank you very much. Then I will call the Madame and announce that you are going. Number 42... Now listen, girls. This is important. Attorney Berg announces he is coming here with the new heir. That's why we have our party tonight... I expect that you will behave properly. Be nice to our guests so they feel comfortable - Now remember to be nice - Yes, Madame. Here we are. Careful, Rasmussen. - Good evening, Madame. - Come in, attorney Berg. Feel free to join us. Come on, please do. I am so glat to meet you. How was your trip? No one may enter and no must go out! Understood? - Turn around, Rasmussen. - Yes, overconstable. Quiet, they could hear us. Do you think this is a Crossroads? Do not stand there! You were supposed to guard the tandem bicycle. Watch it so you do not trip over yourself. Welcome to the table. Cheers, we have to make a toast to each other. Should we test our new friendship tonight, sir? - so then the sailors said to the nun... - Not that one, Counselor. Cheers! Have fun everyone. - Come on, my little counselor. - A moment. Come now, counselor. This way, yes. Up with your hands. Aren't they a bit too small? - What a wonderful song, ma'am. - Call me Anna. Then you need to call me Marinus Marinus... so manly. - Shouldn't we take a little... - Yes, we should. - But you said foreign... - Yes, now take away these. No, you stay here. Up the stairs with you... - Cheers, Anna. - Cheers, Marinus. - What a wonderful sherry. - It's only port wine... Jar, it's a wonderful port wine, too. - Let's have some music. - Yes, thank you. Well, girls, who's first up? A genuine gold coin is at stake. So yes, yes, further down... I do what I can. No, it overturned. I cannot go further down. It's there, look and you will see. Marinus, come on. - Come on, Marinus. - I'm coming. Goodnight, Anna. How dare she... Good evening. I have to shoot you with my new equipment Amalias gentleman was a hairdresser with interests in the art of intimate hair. Elizabeth had a good eye for photographer, who went by... ...the nickname of the city... which Elizabeth did not know... yet. I read it in Julius' old books and that was where we got the idea. It sounds interesting. With the group also was Baker Boller,... ...best known for his mayoral wreath that Margurite praised. - Are you hot? - Yes, I'll take off the vest? Hands up or down with the pants! You do not want to join in and help me? Johanne and Charlotte had prepared a private orgy. Something Charlotte read in the old books. She and Johanne emptied every fruit bowl in the house It's already there... - Would you help me? - With pleasure. - Here you go! - Thank you. No, stop now. This will not do. I'm here on a mission... I'm in the secret police, so this will not do. It is because of the service. That you will understand. I know, I know... if you agree to it, of course. If you have no objection, so maybe you could... ...maybe you could search the body of the lady. I'm coming now! Charlotte had long wanted to feel the cold fruit on their bodies. She and Johanne had fantasized about possibility of an orgy. You have to work with care otherwise you can lose everything. - And if you are on track? - Then pulled the noose out the change. - Why stick with the change? - In anticipation of reinforcement, - I can wait for days. - As long as I can not wait. Jensigne was romantic... but also naive. I begrudged her, her breasts and voluptuous body. She could never stop talking about the Lieutenant's magnificant posture,... And... it was truly an adornment for light cavalry. My own cavalier was Julius' younger brother As old as my father, but oh so serious. His hands were so soft and I gave myself entirely to him. He gave me my first real love that night. It was the psychological game... I had a gun, he did not know about... - A secret weapon... - Stop interrupting me. Even if you are beautiful and have the most glorious dimples, so... The most wonderful eyes. It was a psychological weapon I used. - A future weapon, then? - Stop gorging on it there. Careful. Not so rough. I'm afraid. Good evening. Can I take this champagne bottle? They must have had it good, the ancient Romans. Now it was good advice expensive. I threw myself on him... Do not misunderstand me, it was only in the service... - I understand. - It was good. Do you not want hear about when I managed a great pirate? Yes, please. Even as an experienced police I can learn something. Come in. Am I disturbing you, or can I help? Would you please stay here while I call? Lenora was the first to discover Ramon's talents. Something he hid well, according to her. His only concern was and remained the diamond. But still the experience was great. We had never had an adventurer in the house before. This will be expensive, officer. Can't you see I'm a priest? Priest... a wolf in sheep's clothing... I know your type. I myself have gone to the police academy. I want to call the banana puree! Girls, come and hear the big news! Our heir disappeared before we could react. The diamond he had brought with him. With it, he saved the family's honor for its youngest son. He donated the house to Madame and girls heritage forever. We must celebrate, but what we did not know... ...was that the real heir was still in the house. Rasmussen, he has escaped! Whar are you sitting and doing nothing? What do you think you are in for? As decoration, right? - I got a notification. - Oh, so what? He is in my care. Then you may still have a future in the police, Rasmussen Finally, finally... But who is it, Rasmussen? Don't worry, little man. I have just waved him off. A real gentleman. He has gone! Are you crazy everybody? Elizabeth, Camilla, after him. Rasmussen... No, never mind that! Overconstable, help me! This was not in police manual?! They are taking my pants! Wake up, little Marinus. These men! Do not want to be the man in the house, so that it stays in the family? And so it happened, that we got a new man in the house. Additionally, the rightful heir. So we lived happy, the whole family.
