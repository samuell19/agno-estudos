Times, Tribune, American News. Morning papers. - Morning papers. - Times Well, what do you think? Is Al Howard gonna beat the rap? - It all depends on Judy Carroll's story. - That's a spot for a guy to be in. - Is she friendly? - I don't know. - Neither does Al. - Well, they'll soon find out. They sure will. You are acquainted with the defendant Al Howard, aren't you, Miss Carroll? Yes. In fact, Miss Carroll, you're on, um... Shall we say, um... ...very friendly terms with him, aren't you? Shall we say that we were... practically engaged up to a year ago. Thank you, Miss Carroll, I should have thought of that phrasing myself. You said up to a year ago? Does that mean that you are not practically engaged to Commissioner Howard now? That means I haven't seen Commissioner Howard for over a year until today. But perhaps you'd tell us just why this engagement terminated a year ago. I object, Your Honor! The relationship of Miss Carroll to my client... ...before this alleged bribe was taken has nothing to do with this case. I submit, Your Honor, that it has. I'm trying to show that Al Howard accepted a bribe... ...and that Miss Carroll knows where that money went to. Objection overruled. I repeat, Miss Carroll. Why did you and Al Howard terminate your engagement a year ago? We disagreed. It wasn't because he asked you to return the money he had put in your name, was it? I don't remember that he put any money in my name. Oh, you don't remember, hah! Well, most young ladies would remember if a gentleman had given them any large sums. Wouldn't they, Miss Carroll? I know one young lady who would. Silence in the court, please. Say, will you please sit down? - Are you addressing me? - Yes, sit down, sit down. - Oh, shut up! - Sit down, madam, or I'll put you out. Silence in the court, please! Are you telling the court, Miss Carroll, that Commissioner Howard never gave you any large sums? I'm telling the world he didn't. He didn't have any large sums when I knew him. But you lived extravagantly, Miss Carroll. You had an expensive apartment, you dressed well. - Didn't you? - Yes. Then where did that money come from, Miss Carroll? I happen to be on the stage, Mr. Carter, I draw a fairly good salary. Oh! And we're to understand... that your salary was sufficient... to provide you with the luxuries you enjoyed... ...during your engagement to Mr. Howard? What's that blackguard trying to insinuate? Don't you tell him, Judy, don't you tell him! He isn't asking those questions out of no curiosity! - Put that woman out. - Come on, madam. - I don't know you. - Come on. - Where to? - Outside, and hold your tongue. There's no law against free speech in this courtroom! I haven't anything to be arrested for. Give me a light! Silence! Silence! And you're quite sure your memory's correct... ...about the amount of your salary during all this time. My manager, Mr. De Sola, is sitting over there. He can tell you the amount of my salary at that time. Oh, yes, yes... But I don't believe we'll call upon Mr. De Sola today. To change the subject rather abruptly, you have a baby, have you not, Miss Carroll? You don't mind me calling you miss in a question like that, but... I see no other way of phrasing it. I'm adopting a child, if that's what you mean. Well, that's not exactly what I mean, but... However, we won't quibble over a little word like "adopted". You didn't happen to adopt it because Al Howard was the father, did you? What do you mean father? I'll kill you, you dirty rat! - Quiet, Miss Carroll. - I object, Your Honor. The District Attorney is going too far. Al Howard is not the father. If you don't believe me, you can call up the Stuyvesant Home and... ...see the adoption papers. All right, Miss Carroll, all right. That'll be all, thank you. - Call the next witness. - John Roberts, take the stand, please. Thanks, Judy. Sorry I let you in for this. Oh, that's all right, Al. I may need you for a reference some day. You can have me for anything any time, Judy. Thanks, Al. - Goodbye. - Goodbye, Judy. Do you think my testimony helped Al? But it didn't do you any good. - It was the truth. - Ah... Well, I couldn't refuse to give it. If Al Howard weren't a rat, he wouldn't have let you testify. Why have you always disliked him so? Jealousy, partly. Jealous? My businesslike manager? That is a laugh. It isn't a laugh for me. Oh, no, De Sola. Don't you start carrying the torch. All right, Judy, forget it. Say, I'm having the hardest time finding you the proper play. I've read hundreds of plays... Now, once upon a time when I was a little girl, we lived in a little white cottage. It was on the edge of a glen. Now, the glen was owned by the little people. Sometimes at night I've seen their lights. - Lights? - Yes, lights, lights. Oh, but not like these. It was in Ireland. Now, one night my father was coming home late. It was a dark, dark night, and there wasn't any moon. And there wasn't any stars. And he got lost. And where do you think he got lost? Where? He got lost in the glen. The fairy people got him... yes. The fairy people got him and we didn't... see hide nor hair of him again... Oh, not for days. The fairy people had him under a spell. Hello, precious. Judy, my Judy! Oh, oh, oh, Judy's falling! Oh, my precious me, what a big fall! Come here and give me a hug. Judy, there's a big girl! Oh, my gracious, what've you been doing all day? What've you been doing all day? You tell me what've you been doing. Please, Miss. Come on, Lilibeth. Come on, darling, you must have your milk. Run along and have milk and then we'll play, hm? That's a baby, that's a girl. Well, that was a nice bit of entertainment you surprised us with in court. - Why, Judy, I never done a thing. - Not much. If they'd known you were my mother, I don't know what would have happened. - What did happen? - Plenty, unfortunately. Well, I guess I'll go and rest my poor rheumatic bones. - Snooks. - Hm? No tonics. Why, Judy, there ain't a drop in the house. I don't know what makes you so suspicious. Poor old Snooks. - But what can you do? - Just what you're doing. She has a good time. Oh, a fire engine! Did she finish her milk? - Yes... - Every bit of it? Every drop? Come on, we'll be a fire engine. Ding-a-ling-a-ling. Fire! Fire! Fire! Oooh! An accident, my precious. You might teach the child not to make left turns. - Oh, you're only a jaywalker, Tony. - Here I am sitting down... You are going to make a roughneck of her. Oh, no. Oh, no. One roughneck in this family is enough. Lilibeth's going to be a lady. Come on, darling, come on. We're going to sing Foolish to sleep, shall we? Come on, we'll put her right down here and then you put her in bed. And I'll turn the covers down. Alright, now you go and get Foolish. There we are, we turn this one down. And then we turn this one... that's a girl! My, she's a heavy baby, isn't she? There we are, let's put her to bed. Now come on, cover her up. Cover her up. - I have to get her leg in. - That's right. There... now the other one. Very carefully. Oh, she looks very comfortable now. I have to put her hand in. Now, you keep your hands down. Now you keep quiet lying down and you and me will... Are you gonna kiss her? Let's kiss her. Now I'll kiss her. - I've been eating candies. - I think you have. I think you... Oh, thank you very much. That was very sweet, Lilibeth. - Let's kiss... let's sing to her, hm? - Alright. Bye, li'l-o Foolish Bye, li'l-o Foolish Bye, li'l-o Foolish, Bye, li'l-o Foolish. Lovely, now let's sing together for her. ( humming ) # Sleep, my sweet, # # Your dreamboat comes # # Sail on # # While the sandman hums # ( humming ) Now come on. Do you think she's going to be a good girl? - Yes. - Don't you let her cry, will you? - No. - I don't think she should cry. Because good dollies never cry, do they? Are you sure this mother urge won't wear off, Judy? Well, I've had it for seventy odd years now, man, and boy! They need a lot of looking after, you know, especially girls. Hm, don't I know it. And this one's going to get plenty of looking after. I haven't bumped my shins on the facts of life for nothing. Wait until she gets old enough to notice a good-looking boy. The moment that she's old enough... to notice the difference between a good-looking boy... ...and a plate of spinach, I'll be her shadow. You can't keep her wrapped in cotton, Judy. She'll want to make her own mistakes. She can make her own mistakes. But she'll never make any of mine. I'll see to that. What's this, Judy? Oh, good heavens. Now, Judy, this used to be a charming room, and now it's littered with... with broken dollhouses and gobs of bread and butter. All right, calm down, it's not going to kill you. Mrs. Bronson from the children's home, Miss Carroll. Oh, yes, Brida. She's probably here with the adoption papers. Will you look after Lilibeth till I come back? You bet. - How do you do, Mrs. Bronson? - How do you do, Miss Carroll? This is Mr. Farley of the Child Welfare. - Miss Carroll. - How do you do, Mr. Farley? I suppose you brought the adoption papers. Won't you come in? No, thanks. The fact is... we've come to get the baby. Get the ba... Suppose you let me explain. It's this way, Miss Carroll. In view of the headlines in the newspapers, in view of your life so unfortunately brought out at this trial... I suppose you've seen the afternoon papers. Yes, yes, I have. You see the name of the home was mentioned in the papers. Why, our telephone hasn't been still one moment since. Some of our wealthiest supporters can't see how we could have done such a thing. You mean... that I can't have Lilibeth... ...because I was once a friend of Al Howard's? We are sorry, Miss Carroll, but that is a decision of the board. - Why, you dirty, narrow-minded... - Miss Carroll, please! I suppose you don't think I'm good enough to adopt a child. Would it be better off in some institution? At least she is surrounded with proper influences there. We're just carrying out orders. But you can't. You can't. You can't take Lilibeth from me. I'm crazy about her... I'd die without her. Oh, I can take care of her. I can give her everything. All the best advantages, send her to the best schools. Take her to Europe, teach her French. I can make a lady out of her. Oh, please, she won't be unhappy with me. I'll do everything for her. I have no doubt. You can give the child many material advantages. But the home has to consider what spiritual advantages she would receive. And I am afraid, Miss Carroll... I'll teach her to be good if that's what you mean. I'm having a lesson right now. And how smart it is to be good. Besides, I wouldn't want her to be anything else. I'd die if she were. Don't you see? I want to save her from all I've been through. I'm sorry, Miss Carroll, but we'll have to take Elizabeth back with us. - No. - It's the rules of the... No, no, I tell you! I won't let you, I'll take it to court! We have the law with us, Miss Carroll! Either you give us the child, or we shall have to take her. What's wrong, Judy? They're... They're taking Lilibeth away from me. Oh, darling. - Did you give her some sleeping pills? - No! She's not sick! Oh, well look here. Isn't she a sweet thing? Didn't you give her sleeping pills? Um, Miss Evans... will you... Will you go and get the baby's hat and coat? The warm one. No, Judy, no... I don't want to go. Oh, but darling, you mustn't cry. You're going back to all those little children. But I don't want to go! Oh, darling, Judy will come and see you. We'll have a lot of fun, we'll play house and... We'll play piggyback, come on. Let's play piggyback now, come on. Come on. Oh, you mustn't cry, darling. Think of all the little playmates, you won't miss me so. - Now, put his... - But I don't want to go! There, there, darling, Judy'll come and see you. You want to take Foolish with you? All right, we'll have Foolish. There's my girl. There, look, Foolish wants to go with you. Oh, my darling. There, there, my darling. You'd better take her. Goodbye, darling. Judy, Judy, I want to stay with Judy. Ma! Judy, now... Judy. As soon as possible I'll make arrangements for you and Snoops to go abroad. Around the world. And you'll have new things to see and think about. And when you come back, it will be easier for you. - You forgot this, Brida. - I'm sorry, Miss Carroll. - Got everything, Snooks? - Sure. Little old New York. It looks pretty good to me. I... I'm kind of glad to be back. - Aren't you, Snooks? - I should say so. I haven't had a drink for the kick of it since we left. Ma, don't you ever think of your poor old kidney? My kidneys aren't considerate of me, why should I think of them? - Muddy's baby. - Hm? Muddy's baby, come here. How does Muddy look? Well, taking it all in all, Muddy looks like a babe in arms. The Muddy's baby looks like Mona the Hag. Oh, these Paris plastic surgeons are certainly marvelous. Ch?re Paris, ch?re Paris. Don't you ever dare tell anyone I had my face lifted. - Snooks? - Hm? Did you declare everything? Why, of course I declared everything. Sure you're not sneaking anything in? Why, dear, talking to your poor old mother like that. What's this bulge? Oh, I dressed in a hurry this morning and I didn't know what I was doing. Now you're spoiling my homecoming. Listen, you'd better be careful or you'll land us all in jail. Remember how Pa used to hate jail? Don't you dare mention that awful man in my presence again! Come in. Tony! Brida, please close the curtains, the place is swarming with reporters. Come here, Tony, gee, I'm glad to see you! Judy! - Bon jour! - Bon jour, bon jour! - How are you, Snooks? - Say, how did you get on this boat? I came on with a pilot. But say, Snooks, you look like a spring chicken. Oh, merci, merci. You look like a spring chicken yourself. You're looking marvelous. I'm glad to see you again. I'm glad to see you too. Come on, let's sit down. Tell me all the dirt. Do you realize I haven't seen that old pan of yours for eight months? Two hundred thirty-eight and one half days, to be exact. I added it up. Judy... - I've some important news to tell you. - De Sola, I found the play. - What's it about. - You may not like it... ...because it's different than anything I've ever done, but it's swell. - Oh, who wrote it? - Oh, some American Pell, um... Jacobs Van Riker Pell. You would have to go to Europe to find a play written by an American. - Travel pays. - Well, I'll read it over the weekend. Oh, no, no, you've got to meet him this afternoon. Pell's coming to my house tonight, I wirelessed him. Why, Judy, what's the rush, don't you want a few days' rest? Rest? That's the best thing I've done for eight months. Don't you believe it! There wasn't a moment's rest. She bounced me all over Europe. Oh, Snooks, you'd bounce anywhere. - That's a very interesting title. - You like "Rockabye"? What's it about? A baby. All right, dear, I'll read it as soon as I get back to the office. De Sola, you wrote me that someone had adopted Lilibeth - Did you find out who? - Oh, yes. And I've arranged for you to see her whenever you want to. Her new parents are very understanding people. Oh, Tony, that's sweet. That's the best news you could have brought me. Darling, I've got some bad news for you too. Al Howard's dead. Killed two days ago. Maybe by some gunmen. And the newspapers are full of it, headlining you, of course. Oh, the whole thing had to come out the day you are arriving. Oh, poor Al, poor Al. He was a prince. He didn't have this thing coming to him. Oh, Judy, I brought you some clothes. Put them on. I've arranged to take you up through the baggage hole with Brida. You'll dodge the reporters that way. And Snooks, You leave the boat by yourself. And if any reporter speaks to you, tell them that Judy got off at quarantine. But the reporters will probably think I'm Judy. We look so much alike now. It slipped! The whole darn thing slipped. It's down on my knees. - Who's this mug? - I don't know, manager or something. - How much? - A dollar eighty. That's all right. - Where's Judy Carroll? - Who? Don't give us that. We know you're De Sola. - Get a load of this. - What's all the excitement, boys? You can read, can't you? - Oh. - Well, what do you think? I'm sure Miss Carroll doesn't know a thing about it. Oh, no? She disappeared off that boat pretty neatly, didn't she? Say, she knows Al's dead. I didn't even know that she does. Well, how about getting in the house and having a little chat? Yeah, come on. - No, boys, that isn't the right procedure. - We play ball is she does. Now, all right, I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll go in and talk to Miss Carroll and see what I can do. - Give me that paper. - Make it snappy. I'll be right out. Suppose she goes out the back door or something? Oh, now, don't be so cynical. That's not becoming newspaperman. Mr. Pell, Miss Carroll will be down in a moment. Thank you. Good evening, Mr. Pell. - I'm Anthony De Sola. - How do you do, Mr. De Sola. Very glad to find you here alone. Come on, let's sit down. I suppose you know Judy wants to do your play. Yes, she sent me a wireless. Well, Pell, you've written an excellent play. - But not for Judy. - Thanks. I'm afraid I agree with you on both counts. Well, then you realize that your play... ...is too much like certain episodes in Judy's own life. I'm afraid I don't know very much about Miss Carroll's life. Hm. Did you read the papers today? Oh... Al Howard. Oh, yes, they were engaged or something. Yes. You see the similarity now. Possibly. Then obviously you must agree with me that Judy shouldn't do your play. I agree with you. But for a different reason. What is your reason? Well, you pardon my speaking quite frankly. But I don't believe Miss Carroll's a good enough actress to do my play. She hasn't the fire, the feeling. My girl's got to be a real person. Simple, direct, sincere. You don't think Judy could play a gutter girl like you've written? Not very convincingly. Well, Miss Carroll's a charming actress of light, sophisticated plays. But she'd be making an awful mistake to try to do mine. Mr. Pell, this is the sincerest compliment I've ever had. Because as it happens, I took Judy Carroll... ...out of that very environment you've written about. I made her that glamorous, smart-witted woman she is today. I made money with her in those light, sophisticated plays you speak of. I made a lady of her. And I don't want her to do any play that would recall the past... ...or would keep alive a scandal that should be allowed to die off. I heard that! I heard every word you said. I'm not too much of a lady to listen through keyholes. So, you don't think I can do Rockabye, eh? Because she's a tramp in love with a crook. I can't do that, eh? Because she's a hard-boiled trollop from Second Avenue. I can't do that, huh? Listen, palsy, you can take it from me that's a side of life I know inside out... ...and how. But the play is too reminiscent of Al Howard. What of it? Everyone that knows me knows about Al Howard. And they won't forget it. Poor old Al. Couldn't even die without my hogging his publicity. No, Judy, now that he's gone, I hope the whole thing will be allowed to die out. - But if you should do Mr. Pell's play... - I'm going to do Mr. Pell's play! You are under contract to me and I decide what you shall do. Then you might as well decide right now on Rockabye, because that's what I'll do! What do you think of that, Mr. Pell? Oh, how do you do? How do you do? Well, he doesn't want you to do it either. Oh, but I do, I think she's perfect for it. Why, you just said that she couldn't do anything else but light things. I just said you never gave her anything but light things to do. Nothing anywhere nearly good enough for her talent. I think you'd be marvelous in Rockabye, Miss Carroll. The reporters are asking when they could expect to see Mr. De Sola. I'll be down in a minute. And we'll settle this when I get back. But until then, let me tell you something. I think you're insane, Miss Carroll. Oh, I hope I am, I love it! He's all steamed up about it, isn't he? - Are you really going to do Rockabye? - Want me to? It's too good to be true. You know, you're not at all like the parts you play. Are you like the parts you write? I'm not a hard-boiled trollop from Second Avenue. Do you suppose he'll come back with a lot more arguments? Oh, probably. Oh, I don't feel like battling tonight, I... I'm low, I... I've got a lot of things to forget. Well, let's do something about it. I know. Let's go out and play. - That's a swell idea. - Come on, we'll go out through the garden. # A lonely bird in a cage # # Tra-la-la-la # Hello, Ma. Ma, come on down and meet Mr. Pell. Mr. Pell? The Mr. Pell of the beautiful play? Yeah, come on down. Oh, half a moment, my child, half a moment. The Muddy slipped. Oh, Mr. Pell, such a beautiful play. Oh, such a beautiful play. Oh, Snooks, are you all right? Here, let me help you. Explain, young man, just why did you trip me? It's not at all funny to trip a lady coming downstairs, I might have fallen. Come on, Ma, come on. - Sure you're all right? - Of course I'm all right. Why shouldn't I be all right? Young man, I can travel under my own power. Now, Ma, be a good girl and go over there and sit down. And be nice to Mr. Pell while I go and get my wrap. - Ah... who's the Muddy's baby? - I'm the Muddy's baby. Now go on over there and sit down. - Yes, I'll go. - That's a good girl. You know, these steps are awfully dangerous. Anyone can slip on them, see? I like you. Young man! Come here. Where are my earrings? Why, I'm terribly sorry, I'd forgotten I had them. Oh, yeah? - Here they are. - Oh, yeah? Well... You see, when you slipped, I picked them up. - Oh, yeah? - Well, naturally, I... I... Well, why did I have to ask for them in my own house? Oh, no you don't... Oh, no, indeed! Coming around tripping up people in their own houses. Playwright... It's a fine play. I suppose you think these things don't cost money. I'll see that no one else gets them, by gosh. Come here! Come on, sit down. A lot of swank putting this stuff into a decanter. Have some? It's terrible. No, thanks. Well, here's down the hatch. Well, I'm ready. Good night, Mom. Now, be a good girl and go to bed. - Agh, bed... - Good night, Mrs. Carroll. Ah... Something to look at, isn't she, Mr. Pell? Something to be proud of. She's a real lady. Raised under her mother's wing. Oh, blood will tell. - Good night, Ma. Go to bed. - Good night, Mrs. Carroll. Hey, Judy, don't let that son of a gun trip you. Oh, Ma! Come on, come on! Let's beat it before De Sola gets us. Well, we're on our way. Where to? Well, that's funny, I never thought of that. Let's confer. I know. I'll take you on a sentimental journey. I'll show you where I started life, in the gashouse district. - Swell, let's find a taxi. - No, no! I have an old cabbie around here. Come on, let's go. I tell you this. You must never stay away so long again. Don't ever do it. You know, Mildred and I, we've missed you. Did you miss me, Mildred? Well, you and I will have to go out on a party some night together. - Just us two girls. - Why can't we make it a foursome? Well, I suppose I'll have to give in. - You got to get hold of me. - Come on, you can take it. Lucky nobody drinks around here. Listen, stranger, in my day they used to call this Dead Man's Gulch. That's a good one. Oh, you're here... Hi, Judy, how are you? Hello, so glad to see you here. Hello, guys! Hello, Judy, remember this? Sure I do! - Well, hello there! - Hi, Jimmy! Bless my sister's cat suspended. Judy Carroll, the sweetest nightingale. Hello there, Fagin. Say how is that drunken horse of yours? I've got some stuff over here that I think he'll hold down alright. Come on, Jimmy! Hey, Harry, Harry! Look who's here. - Hello, Harry old boy, how are you? - Well, Judy, it's good to see you again. Come on, Harry, make it snappy. Dip into the safe and get some of that special grandma's delight. Four glasses, wer'e all going to dip the beak. - That's it, is it? - That's the stuff. Now folks, let's start the real business of the evening... ...by drinking a toast to the little girl that made good in the big city. And I'll be drinking to the big city that just made good with the little girl. Hey, Harry, come on, cook up another one of those for Judy and Mr. Pell. Uh-oh, last minute orders, don't forget my friend Fagin. This one's not on the house. Well, kid, come on now, make yourself at home. What do you mean home, I'm out for a good time. Oops, pardon me just a minute. Looks like one of my stockholders requires a little attention. Well, here's bottoms up for the old tenth ward. - What ward? - Tenth. Oh, okay. - Hello, Doc! - Good evening, James. Well, I guess everything goes now, there's a doctor in the house. Come on. Would you please play Poor Butterfly, mister, please? How do you do? I was just asking him if he would please play Poor Butterfly. Well, stick to it, boy. You remember me, would you please play Poor Butterfly? My instruments, please. Now wait a minute, Doc, don't get excited. Take it easy, now, take it easy, relax, open your pores. Who are you waving at? Come on, let me help you. That's all there is to it. Simple. There you are. Calunk! Oh, boy. I feel like a new man. - Well, let's give the new man a drink. - Good idea. Tell me something. How did you ever happen write a play like Rockabye? Give me my cigarette holder, will you? You seem so sort of... well, young to know about such things. Old Mother Methuselah speaking. Oh, my lad, I've had a lot more experience than you have. Oh, the child takes on. Here, blow on Papa's hanky. As a matter of fact I have never been a child. I've fought and schemed for everything I've ever had. Ever since I was old enough to dodge coppers. And that, my lad, was during the Civil War. Yet, you seem like a very young, very wistful, very little girl to me. - That's what drink does to you. - No, that's what you do to me. Jake, I have an idea. I know a very nice girl for you. - You? - No, no, seriously. I think you should be married to a terribly nice girl. Well, I am married to a terribly nice girl. I knew it, it never fails. I've never set my heart on anything that it didn't turn out to be married. Well, my wife and I are being divorced in October. - What year? - This year, darling. Do you feel badly about it? Well, not anymore. You know, I believe in letting everybody having what they want, if you can. What about what you want? Oh, I don't want very much. At least I haven't up till tonight. Wish I didn't. I want a lot of things. Not more than I'll ever get, I guess. For instance. Oh, a lot of things. But what? Oh, little pancakes at Jiles'. You know, I've never had enough pancakes. - What else do you like? - Would you really like to know? Yes, I want to know all the things you like most. Chinchilla, smelly cheese... Oh, boy, that first cigarette in the morning. Millions of divine slippers. And... the first kiss after the quarrell. Pretzels. Having the back of my neck rubbed. The smell of new luggage. Debussy's music. And colored babies. And you know what? - What? - Toy balloons. You know, I've never had a toy balloon and I've wanted one all my life. I'll bet you never had a colored baby either. Pardon me. I wonder if you could use your influence... ...to get that mug to play Poor Butterfly. We'll go and se what we can do about it right away. Oh, thank you. Come on over this way, pardon me, please. Pardon me, this is important, it's me again, but she wants you to play Poor Butterfly. - Here's your best health, Judy. - Well, that's hardly a toast for a doctor. Would you please play Poor Butterfly? Oh, come on, now, Judy, give us a little song. Oh, no, oh, no... - Come on, sing that old favorite. - No, no, no. - Sing Poor Butterfly. - All right, I'll sing Poor Butterfly. Atta bouncing baby! Come on, All, hit those horse teeth. # Baby you're not my dream # - Poor butterfly. # I know the milk from the cream # # But it might as well be you, dear # # Till the right man comes my way # # Hand me that well-known line # # Tell me I'm too, too divine # # And I promise to be true, dear # # Till the right man comes my way # # Oh, pretty me underneath the tree # # Waiting for the truth to fall # # If I land, proves it only can # # Life's a bowl of cherries after all # # Baby you're just a fake # # Strictly a man on the make # # But it might as well be you, dear # # Till the right man comes my way # # Till the right man comes my way # # Pretty me underneath a tree # # Waiting for the truth to fall # # If I land, proves it only can # You see what a good influence I have on you? I've got you on the water wagon. Listen, I'm hungry, practically starved. Let's go up to my house and run up some breakfast. Isn't it very late? Well, if anything, I should say that it was very early. Mr. Spinkler! Want to join us for breakfast? Thanks, Judy, but the missus expects me to come home hungry. Well, if it's like that, drop us off at the next dry spot, will you? Wait until you take these. This is my specialty. I can certainly do this better than I can do anything else. As well as mess up my whole... - The missing link. - Who? It. Oh, yeah? You like your toast thick or thin? Yes. - You like your eggs scrambled or scrambled? - Yes. - Oh, you fool. - Who's a fool? - You're a fool! - Who's a fool?! You're a... Ahhh! - Who's a fool? - Stop it, I don't think it's a bit funny! Stop it! Now, really, really... Put it down, I knew a woman that was killed that way once. Snooks' kid sister. All right. - Now who's a fool? - You're a fool. Oh, now really, that hurt! I don't think that's a bit funny. - That really hurt. - Let that be a lesson to you. Jakie is nobody's fool. Excuse me. - Darling. - Yes? Excuse me. Who is nobody's fool? That's enough! Stop it, stop it, what do you think you're doing? What do you think? You threw a pie at me, didn't you? - Will you stop, let go of me! - You threw a pie, you threw a pie! - Let go of me! - You threw a pie... This is very dangerous! I know somebody that was killed too... Stop it, let go of me... Jake, I've got a balloon. Are you going to sleep your life away, darling? Oh, darling, darling! Darling, darling, darling, darling. Did you rob a balloon factory, darling? I couldn't get a chinchilla factory. - Didn't you go to bed at all last night? - No. But I had a swell nap in the bathtub. Good morning, Brida, darling. Good morning, Miss Carroll. The kitchen was in a mess this morning. It looked like a cyclone had struck it. Oh, it did, it did. Mr. De Sola is here, Miss Carroll. Oh... well, tell him I'm not in. He saw Mr. Pell's hat. All right, then. Bring him up. Darling, do you remember last night? I remember you. Do you remember the last thing I said to you on the kitchen floor? That you didn't know whether it was love or an attack of jaundice. Well, I found out. It was love. How did you find out? On my way up here this morning I passed the church. Suddenly I wanted to go in. - Did you? - With a load of balloons? Judy! - Hop into bed, will you? - What? - Hop into bed, hurry! - Oh, all right. There, am I all covered up? Wait a minute... there. Come in. - Oh, good morning, Tony. - Good morning. - You remember Mr. Pell, don't you? - Good morning. - Good morning. - Will you have some breakfast? No, thanks. But I'd like to talk to Miss Carroll alone if you don't mind. Oh, that's all right, don't mind me. I'll just take a little snooze. Well, what is this, Judy? Are you utterly without shame? Oh, Tony! Are you utterly without humor? Come on, Jake, get out. I suppose this was meant to amuse me. Well, not altogether. Excuse me, Judy. - Don't go away, darling. - I won't. Well? You and Mr. Pell seem to have got fairly well-acquainted last night. Fairly. Am I to assume he went home last night? I'm sure I don't know where he went. Um, did you promise to do his play? I did. Now, Judy, I'm going to produce Romeo and Juliet for you. Don't think I don't want to do it. But not just yet. I told you if you want to do Rockabye, you must get a new manager. I know. - And you want a new manager? - No. Oh, Tony, you know I'd be lost without you. Oh... all right. If you've made up your mind to do Rockabye, I'll do Rockabye. Oh, Tony, you're a sweet old son of a... - Judy! - I wasn't going to say anything. Shall I call Jake and tell him? Oh, Jake already, eh? - So long. - So long. Get me a swell cast so we can start rehearsals next week, eh? Darling! Come on back! Darling! Jake! Darling! Oh, here you are, thank goodness. Darling, what's wrong? De Sola's in love with you, isn't he? - He doesn't say so. - But he is. I don't know, Jake. Maybe he is. - And you? - No. - I'm not. - Never have been? With Tony? No. But with somebody else. Yes. Darling. - I believe you're jealous. - You know darn well I'm jealous. I suppose you think... ...because I fell for you so easily, Jake. It was never like that before. What was it that Juliet said to Romeo? "And therefore thou mayst think my ?havior light. But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true than those that have more cunning to be strange I should have been more strange, I must confess." Oh, no! - Where's Judy? - Blind man, blind man. Blind man, blind man, blind... - Blind man! - Blind man... Blind man, blind man, blind man... Blind man, blind man... Lili can't find me. Lili... Ahh! - Oh, there she goes! - Oh, she found me. She found Judy, Lili caught Judy. Oh, my gracious! Oh, my goodness... Come here... That was really a clever girl. That was really a clever girl. Give me a big hug and kiss. Um, that was a very nice one. Oh, my goodness me. Now come on, let's sit down and rest for a few minutes. Because if you get tired, ...your new daddy and mommy won't let you go out with me anymore... ...and then I'd cry. Oh, Jake, so divine having her even for a day. - Darling. - Hm? - Want to talk on the telephone? - Yes. - All right, come on. - Here's the telephone. There you are. I didn't put it in there right like this. That's the way we go. Now we have to turn... ring a number, though. - Hello? - Hello, how are you today? Oh, I'm very well, thank you, who is this speaking? Lilibeth. How do you do, Lilibeth, how are you? - Just fine. - How is your dolly? - She's fine, she has a cold. - Oh, my goodness, I'm so sorry. What are you doing for her? Oh,. I'm giving her... giving her orange juice. - Oh, good, and what else? - Cocoa. And is she doing very well under that, um... medicine? Yes. Oh, well, that's nice. Will you come and see me some time soon? Yes, why don't you come over to my house? Well, I'd love to. I'll come over very soon. All right. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. - Want some milk, darling? - Yes. All right. Will you get her some milk for her? Oh, look! Hey, that's a lovely milk. - Thank you, Jake. - You're welcome, sweetheart. Oh, darling, today has really been too divine. Every day's been swell since I've known you, Judy. You know, Jake, I'm terribly nervous. I'm so afraid of that opening night. - I'll die if I ruin your play. - Oh, don't be absurd, sweetheart. - You'll be wonderful. - Oh... Oh, I know somebody's getting sleepy. Oh, somebody's getting sleepy. Judy, will you marry me when I'm free? - You really want me to? - I'll hound you till you do. What would you do if I said no? Try it and see. No, maybe I'd better not take the chance. I'll say yes. Judy. We'll have dozens of these. Only ours will have tousled hair and lovely smiles like their daddy's. They'll look just like their mother or we'll drown them. Well, everybody seems to be here but our hostess. She has to take off all that makeup. - Say, wasn't she swell tonight? - Give me a drink. What do you suppose is keeping Judy? Tony! How are you, how have you been? Thank you very much indeed. Is Judy here? Hello, Jimmy, how are you? I'm better. Not yet. Don't you know where she is? Looking for Pell heaven knows where. She left the theater an hour ago. Why do you suppose he stayed away from his opening night? I've never heard of an author doing such a thing. At least he could have sent Judy some word. Pardon me, Mr. Pell just telephoned. He said he'd be here in an hour or so. - Where is he? - He didn't say. Did you ask him just where in blazes he'd been all evening. - No, I didn't. - Now where do you suppose Judy is? I'm all in. Keep the ballroom. - Snooks! - Baby. Have you heard from him? - Yes, he's just telephoned. - Is he all right? Of course he's all right. He said he'd be here in an hour or two. I've been going nearly crazy. I don't see how I got through the play tonight. Oh, Ma, this being in love. Makes a cry baby of you. Now come on, come on, buck up, buck up. You've got guests in there, come on, now, Oh, come on with Muddy, baby. Here we are! - You were splendid! - Oh, marvelous! Judy, you were marvelous! Darling! - Congratulations, Judy! - Thank you. - You were great! - You tell them. Oh, Miss Carroll, Mrs. Pell has just arrived. She wants to talk with you. - Who? - Mr. Pell's mother, I think. She's in the library. How do you do, Mrs. Pell? How do you do, Miss Carroll? - Has anything happened to Jake? - No, he's all right, I just left him. - Sit down, won't you? - Thank you. Miss Carroll, my son will not be pleased at my coming to you. But I had to. Of course you knew that his wife was getting a divorce. Yes, Jake told me when we first met. I realize that the divorce was decided upon before my son met you. And in the ordinary course of events... ...my daughter-in-law would doubtless have gone ahead with it. She's not going ahead with it? Miss Carroll, soon after my son and his wife separated, Enid found that she was going to have a baby. She didn't tell anyone. She wired me yesterday. Her child was born in the hospital this afternoon. I have taken my son there, it was his place. What are you coming to me for? I've come to ask you to release my son from any... any arrangement that he may have with you. Your son asked me to marry him as soon as he got his divorce. And I ask you to send him back to his wife and his son. Mrs. Pell, I love your son. His happiness lies with me, not Enid. A husband and wife may have differences that seem serious. But when their child arrives, their own flesh and blood, those differences vanish. No... I don't believe it. I don't believe it! You're saying that just to separate us! I'm thinking of my son's happiness. And yours too, my dear. You should see him with his baby. That look in his eyes. I won't give him up. Jake loves me, and nobody else. Except his son. That boy will always be between you. Jake will always be remembering and wondering about him. And blaming himself for not being a real father to him. No, he won't! Children don't keep husbands and wives together anymore. I'm afraid you're old-fashioned, Mrs. Pell. You may be right, but I don't think so. I'll go now. I can't believe that you're as indifferent to my grandchild's rights... ...and to my son's real happiness as you want me to think. And I'm not as indifferent to your happiness as you may think. Thank you for seeing me. - You need a drink, Judy, come on. - I just had a drink. Maybe it's just a punch in the jaw you need. Just had that too. Come on, Judy, take this. What's happened? Have you heard from Jake? His mother was just here. And what? That's that. Mr. Pell's in the library, Miss Carroll. He asks if you'll speak to him there. Tell Mr. Pell that the party's in here, Andrews. Well, here we go. Listen, everybody, here we are! The old combination of Tony and Judy! That spells box office! Wait a minute, wait a minute, what about the new romance? I have only one romance, it's Tony! - Is this an announcement, Judy? - Is it, Tony? - Whatever you want it to be. - Then it's an announcement. Ladies and gentlemen, with the permission of her mother, Miss Judy Carroll announces... that she accepts the tender protection... ...of her manager, Anthony De Sola. Congratulations, Tony, congratulations. But not without marriage. My mother brought me up right. Oh, yeah? Oh, there you are, Romeo! Meet the author, everyone! He was too busy to come to his first night. But we'll forgive him because he was having a baby. A baby? What's having a play when you're having a baby, a baby? - Baby! Here, let's drink to the baby! - Sure! Lucky guy, imagine two productions on the same night. To the baby! Judy, I want to speak to you alone. Well, go ahead, speak to me, you're amongst friends. # Baby, you're just a fake # # Strictly a man on the make # - Listen to me, I want to explain why I didn't come to the opening tonight. Oh, that's all right., a gentleman doesn't have to explain having a baby! Oh, come on, let go of me, you're only a fake! Come on, I tell you, let go of me! Crack a gentleman and you'll find a brute. Judy, what's happened, why are you like this? I'm not like anything, I'm celebrating our success, Rockabye. What were you saying as I came in? Oh, did you hear that? I was making Tony offer to marry me. And believe me, it took some making. Then just what were you playing me for? Maybe I was bored. And you came along at the right moment. Or maybe I wanted a good play and you had one. Then all the time you and De Sola... Atta boy, you guessed it! Judy, what are you trying to do? Oh, what's the matter with you? Are you so dumb that you need a ton of bricks to fall on you? Can't you see I'm through, fed up? I don't want to see you again! Why don't you get out? I know what you're trying to do. You're trying to make me believe something that isn't true. I don't know what you're talking about. Oh, I see through your act, darling. But we're going to be together in spite of everything. Nothing can separate us, Judy, nothing in the world. But you must go back to them. Your mother was here, Jake. And she's right. I'd never forgive myself if I kept you away from your son. And you'd never forgive me either. But I love you. But you have a son... Her son. Oh, how I wanted him to be my baby. I wanted all those silly little humdrum things. ??? ...and give him five dollars for his first black eye. How I wanted... Judy, I want to stay with you. I can't leave you, Judy. I love you. I know. But there's something more important than love now, darling. You've got to be sensible. You have an obligation. What's the right thing to do? You're going back and take up your life with Enid. Everything will be different now... ...for both of you. And some time... you'll think of me. You know... For a few short months we had something so nearly perfect... that it couldn't go on. Some people never have that much, darling. I can't leave you, Judy. I can't. There won't be any leaving, sweet. No goodbyes. In a moment, I'll go out of that door... ...just as though I were going for a cigarette. And when I come back, you'll be gone. I sent him back to them, Tony. That was decent of you. He's gone. You've got your work, the play is a success. Yes, I suppose so. And tomorrow is my day with Lilibeth. I'll be all right, I guess. You've been a darling, Tony. Come on, let's get back to that party, they'll all think I'm dead. You're a great lady, Judy.
