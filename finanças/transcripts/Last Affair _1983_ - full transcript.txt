Why choose Paris? Because it's Paris. Good morning, madam. Would you like to buy a balloon? Okay. Hello! Ha-ching? You're so busy running around. You sure you have time to see me? It's my first trip here! Don't forget to come tomorrow. Ah-sing's parents are expecting you. I'm not their future daughter-in-law! They're already sick of me! Hey, this check is for table #3. Sorry! We'll talk tomorrow. You sure you know your way? Don't worry. I'll get there alright. Okay. See you tomorrow. Bye! Bye! This is a nice place. You think so? Maybe I've lived here too long. It's better than Hong Kong anyway. You never used to smoke. Will you still work after you get married? Yes. This restaurant is a family cooperation. I got to know Ah-sing here. How can I not work after getting married? You have to get back to work soon. You might as well take a rest. I'm not tired. Do you remember how we used to study French after work? And planned to roam in Europe. Who'd have thought you'd get married so fast. Remember when I saw you off at the airport. You had a giant backpack. Just like a boy. How time flies! I've forgotten every word of my French. What did Wai-ming have to say? Huh? You're coming here alone by yourself first. Why don't we go out for a walk, Bing? Okay. Ah-sing's home is so far from his restaurant, isn't it a lot of trouble going back and forth? Luckily we have a car. Rents in Paris are so high that if we lived in town it would cost us a fortune. Does Ah-sing's family have permanent residency here? Yes, they're from Vietnam, so it's quite easy since France occupied Vietnam for so long. You used to laugh at me for being a poet. Now that I'm cashier, you must think it hilarious. Sometimes I feel so tired! This is what I'll be wearing to your wedding. Are you Chinese? I've given you all my money. I still have to take a bus to get home. Can I borrow one franc? The next time I see you I'll pay you back for sure. Thanks. Here's the cake! How come there's only one candle? Ah-sing's first birthday! Ah-sing, this is your last birthday as a bachelor. Save a piece for Kwong-ping. Bing made this cake herself. Really? Ha-ching! Thank you. Who is Kwong-ping helping to move house this time? I don't know, but he said he'd be back soon. He's so old, the cake would have to be twice as big to fit all those candles. I'm not that old. Yes, you are. Please take a seat over there. Fine. I haven't seen these old friends for a long time. I saw Ming in monmartre. Who are you talking about? Lam Hung-ming. Don't you know him? Does he paint for tourists? He probably has no choice. A person who comes to Paris to study art wouldn't willingly work on the streets if he didn't have to. No! Some people are willing in order to earn the extra money. I heard you'll be holding a one-man show soon. You should have told us long ago. Congratulations, Siu-tong. It's still not a reality. Don't congratulate me yet. These flowers are for the bride-to-be. Not the birthday boy. Probably stolen from a garden? I picked them on a mountain. Thanks. Pretty? Those flowers you gave Bing are really pretty. I got them at the flower market. Really? Freshly picked from the garden. Is that so? If you have time, take me to the flower market. Fine. Do you play violin in the Metro every day? No. Just once in a while. Some people do it for a living. I don't want to cut in their territory and fight for it. Allow me. This flower is in love with you. I'll get these. To keep me company. Wait. Where have you been to? To get coffee No elevator? It's okay. There's a switch behind you. Landlords here try to save electricity. The light only stays on for a short time. Really? What are you up to? Waiting for it to go out. It's not bad here. Let me put the flowers in water. Thanks. Let's have it on the floor. This is the poster for our opera. I also act in it. We've been planning it for over a year. When are the performances? Next Monday we begin a 10-day run. Ah-sing and others plan to come and cheer. Any tickets left? I'd love to come. I have tickets. We do the managing as well. She's the richest and the most enthusiastic, and she can sing. What about you? My singing frightens people. I just know how to squeak. I do the composing, but they needed people and forced me to play a part. It's a tragedy. Save me a ticket. I live in room 418 of this hotel. It's great if you would come. I'm afraid there will be more people on stage than in the audience. I'll phone you and arrange the time. Do you smoke? Aren't these cigarettes? I have to go. Okay. Wai-ming, I've been in Paris for a week already. Now I know that I've never loved you. There's no way our relationship can continue. You forgot the flowers! Come in and sit down. I should have phoned you first. Not at all. I love surprises. Thanks! Your photo fell on the floor. The picture was taken when Bing and I were in high school. I like a lot, so I brought it along to Paris. I was so young then. I like the way you look now. No, I like the way I was before. I was young and had a lot of dreams. The older you get, the... Just because you're older shouldn't mean you can't do as you please. In any case, the most important thing isn't to sit around and dream, but to live to your heart's content. Right? I already have a husband. Really? He'll come here at the end of the month for Bing's wedding. But I know I'm already in love with you. Why should I feel this way? It's the first time for me. I'm afraid I'll be hurt. Why should you be hurt? It should bring you happiness. I never thought I'd fall in love so suddenly. Maybe you'll laugh at me. But, no matter what happens to our love, I can honestly tell you my feelings for you are real. You believe me, don't you? I want some ice cream. How can you eat ice cream when it's raining? What does rain have to do with ice cream? Okay, okay. Let me get the money. No, it's my treat. "Night falls." "And I am all alone." "There are so many things" "I want to say to you." "For a long time," "your shadow touched my solitary life." "I thought I had a place in your heart." "But you are only a free-spirited breeze." "In the night, sweet like wine," "you mussed my hair" "and covered my eyes." "Why, why does pleasure always bring grief?" "Why am I but a forgotten song?" "Without charm or joy?" "If in your heart," "you can never feel for me," "for whom can I live?" "For whom can I suffer?" "My love is unable" "to bind you to me" "so I put my lips to yours" "to make you silent forever." "Now I know." "Our souls are stilled" "and life passes us by." "No boredom." "And no sadness." "Without the present." "And without eternity." I heard him sing. Really frightful. So he doesn't dare to sing. How are you? He is my fianc√©, Ah Sing. Cheung Hon-ming. Let me introduce you. Sophie, Ha-ching. Thank you for coming. How do you like it? Wait a minute. Let's have a drink together, okay? Okay. Will you come to the hotel to look for me later? Ha-ching, Bing was just looking for you everywhere. I knew you were backstage. How did you like it? It's great! Take a look over there. Good morning. What would you like to buy for this lady? The prettiest thing is that skirt you're wearing. It's for sale. And very cheap. Only 30 francs. Really? Of course. If you want it, I'll take it off right now. Okay. What about Kwong-ping? I don't know. This is for you. Do you like it? Very much! You're the same size as the girl but it looks much better on you. Very pretty! Ha-ching, are you going to Kwong-ping's home? Oh! I know what you're thinking. Anyway, I can't hide the truth from you. I don't know how to! What about Wai-ming? Coming to Paris this time is the first chance. I've had to think clearly about our relationship. I've just discovered that I don't need him at all. Even if we continue, it would only be out of habit. Great! You managed to buy a live fish that's not all. I even bought ginger & onions. Shit! I forgot to buy rice. Is Kwong-ping there? Hello? Who will kill the fish? If you won't, I will. Wow, you've really got guts. I know you like fish. So I went through fire and water to get one. If you won't kill it, then it's up to me. Forgive me. Oh, yes. Just now you got a phone call from a French girl. Really? Maybe it's your girlfriend. I don't know. After dinner I'll take you out to a fun place. How long until we eat? I don't know. Are you that angry? Don't touch me! Hey... what are you doing? Let me down. Say it. Say it. Say you're not mad. Excuse me. I go over to say hello. Come over here and take a seat. I'll bring you 2 glasses of red wine. Sophie! Coming! Excuse me. Why don't you dance? Okay. That guy dancing with you was a noble. After falling on hard times, he sold his title, and then wasted all of that money, too. Let's go. Okay. Good-bye. I want to wash up first. Me, too. Peel it first. No need to. Mmmmm. Very sweet. Have a taste! I think you still have another girlfriend. What are you talking about? What about Sophie? What is it with you two? Do you mean now or before? Now and before. Very simple. We're just friends now. I don't believe you. Why should I lie? Otherwise, why would I introduce you to each other? Okay. I believe you. I don't know why you should doubt me. I've never doubted you. You don't doubt me because you know I love you. I've always wanted to know how to find real happiness. Like those people at the bar just now. They're exactly the same as me. We all want to get as much happiness as possible. But what we end up with is incomplete. Paris is our city. We were destined to meet here. It's only a city, and can't guarantee anything. I cannot trust Paris. I can only trust you. So you're just going to sit back and let me return to the Philippines? You even talk about having a farewell party. Don't you even feel a little bit sad? Your family wants you to go home so you can continue with your studies. They're thinking of your future. I got it, I have to go back to the Philippines for my future. And you? You stay in Paris. You'll have your one-man show soon, of course you can't bother with me! These past years, what have I had to paint in order to service? To paint these Chinese furniture to cheat the foreigners. I have no chance to paint what I like. If this show is a success, it will restore my confidence. I'll paint as I please. Just say the word, I'd stay in Paris. Look at my apartment. It's all courtesy of friends. I can't even handle my own life. The next time I extend my visa, I don't know if I'll even get 3 months. How can I let you stay here with me? Then promise me you'll write often after I return to the Philippines, silly girl! Of course I'll write. Silly girl! I know you think I'm just a kid. Just you wait until I've studied a few more years. Then you won't be able to say I'm a kid. Then I'll have a job, and you'll be a famous painter. Mom and dad won't be able to interfere and we can be together. Right? Absolutely! What are you doing? Get up! They'll be here soon. Who cares? Hello! You came alone? The others haven't come yet? Weren't you supposed to come with Kwong-ping? You look tired. Ha-ching told me about you two. Really? Ha-ching is my best friend. Don't treat her like you treated me. You left me! Wasn't I good to you? Sure, but I wasn't your only girlfriend. So I left you. Ha-ching isn't the same as me. I don't want her to be hurt. What do you want from me? I think about you all the time. It's too bad you can't attend Ah-sing and Bing's wedding. I'll come next summer vacation. Who knows, maybe Bing will have a fat, bouncing baby by then! You're late. I'm sorry, because of busy traffic. Pay for the dinner. Yes, dinner's on me. Not this time, next time. This time we all pay! I want to stay here. Not return to Hong Kong. Because after I go back to Hong Kong, I'll never see you again. How can you stay? Kwong-ping himself doesn't know how long he can stay. I'll stay as long as I can. What about you and Wai-ming? I've already written him a letter, but I haven't mailed it yet. I'll show it to him sooner or later. Sometimes I feel that I... Let's go! Ha-ching, Ha-ching. Mrs Leung, this telex is for you. Thank you. I arrive Paris Charles degaulle airport next Wednesday 9:30 A.M., flight af 179. See you then. Wai-ming. Thanks! 2 salads and 2 pork chops. A bottle of red wine. Thank you! What's the matter, Bing? Shall I phone someone to fill in for you? No, it's nothing. What's with Ha-ching? You haven't mentioned her for days. I haven't seen her. Every time I look for her, she's hardly ever at the hotel. Yesterday I found her, but she said she was busy and had to go out. The last time I saw her, she seemed very unhappy. Is something worrying her? I don't think so. Well, her husband will be here soon. Kwong-ping hasn't come here in a long time. They brought a few things for him from Hong Kong and they're still at my place. Are you Chinese? Yes! I'm looking for this street. It should be near here. Can you help me? Go straight, then left, at the first intersection you take a right, then... You might as well let me show you the way. Thanks! My friend gave me this address. It's a youth hostel. I want to see if there're any beds left. This morning I came by train from Germany. You live in Germany? No, I live in Canada. I've already been through Spain, Italy, Greece, and Germany. Now it's France. My next stop is england, and then it's back to Canada. All by yourself? Sure! If I like the place, I might stay 1 or 2 months. I've already been travelling a year. All my travel expenses I earn by selling handicrafts. What's that? A bicycle. It's so cute. It's for you! Thanks! Hmmm? I was wrong, I thought it was here! It doesn't matter. It's probably in this area. I'll find it myself. Thanks. Bye! Why do you avoid me? I've decided not to see you again. Why? I can't stand you having another woman. I need you to be completely mine. I want to be with you. Stay in Paris with me. - Good morning! - Morning. Beautiful weather. Come on up! Bring my pillow upstairs. S.o.b Okay? Okay! After this show, you'll never have to paint furniture again. I hope so! Don't forget to come to my gallery tomorrow. We should clarify matters soon. Fine. See you tomorrow. Thank you. Oh, my! What a mess. Terrible. What do you think you're doing? You can't do it, do you expect me to give you lessons? How can you pain like this? Paint doesn't grow on trees, you know. Look at those 2 paintings in there. How can I ever deliver them? Here you are. You finished these 2 table tops. Here's 300 francs. Right? Fine. Thanks. Thanks for your help, Mr. Chow. No need to come in the future. Why? Business is slow. We have too much inventory building up, and aren't turning a profit. So I don't need so many people. If business improves, I'll contact you for sure. Hello? What? Is this the car? Yes. I've put you to a lot of trouble. Rebecca, why didn't you find a bigger hotel? Didn't I tell you to stay at the Georges V? We don't need to save the money. This hotel is small and rundown. How can you be comfortable? Don't blame Ha-ching. We picked it for her. If you don't like it, we'll find you another hotel. I like it here. Nice and comfy. What's wrong with that? If Mr. Leung doesn't like it, we'll find you another hotel. Forget it! I'm exhausted, and don't feel like hotel hunting. We'll talk about it tomorrow. Then we'll be off now. Ha-ching, why don't you two come for dinner tonight at the restaurant? Do you want to? No thanks. I'm so tired I can't move. I just want to sleep. Oh yeah, any special dishes at your place? Just simple home cooking. Chinese food, Vietnamese food. Ah-sing's family is from Vietnam. Some of the dishes are pretty good. But I don't know if you'll like them. So you're from Vietnam? We employ a lot of Vietnamese workers at my company. But working in Hong Kong is tough. Not easy like in Europe, so leisurely! I've always wanted to come here for a rest. We have to go. If you can't make it tonight, come tomorrow. Wai-ming is very busy. Ha-ching told me you have to go to Lyon for a conference. I'll be going tomorrow. My main reason for coming to Paris is to attend your wedding. But, I also want to go to this conference. Have you heard of it? It's very important internationally. A lot of famous architects will be there. We really must be going. Bye! Bye! Bye! We've really troubled you today. If we don't see you in the next few days, then see you in church on Saturday! Okay. Bye! Bye! Bing... Bye! What's the matter? I don't feel well. I haven't seen you for a month, and it's still the same excuse. You really won't go with me to Lyon tomorrow? I don't want to, I really don't feel well. Have you taken any medicine? Do you have some aspirin? I'll be okay in a couple of days. If you don't go with me, I'll take the train tomorrow morning and hurry back Friday night. Have you been to the Moulin Rouge yet? Bing and Ah-sing haven't taken you there? What kind of friends are they! They live here. They're not tourists. Why would they go to the Moulin Rouge. You're tired. Get some sleep. Ha-ching! Ha-ching! Ha-ching! Ha-ching! I've been waiting here for ages. So what? Ha-ching! Don't go! Listen to me! Listen to me... Let me go! We're finished. What are you doing? We're finished, totally finished. I'm going back to Hong Kong. Satisfied? I never want to see you again! I'm going back to Hong Kong on Saturday. I have a good idea to have a portrait scratch here. How much for a portrait? Do you want a portrait? It's very cheap. Just take you five minutes, I'm sure you like it. No, thanks. It's not so easy to earn money here. I know you don't have any more furniture to paint. Better to have your painting exhibition as soon as possible. My show? No hope of that! They decided to promote that Japanese painter instead. All that talks were for nothing. Ladies and gentlemen. This is a unique painting exhibition! Just take a look at this glorious work of art. This masterpiece was painted by this young Chinese artist. Please take a closer look. Its composition and use of lines is excellent. Friends, don't miss out on this. Look at this artistic masterpiece. Look at the work by this. Chinese Da Vinci. He's the Chinese artist Chow Siu-tong. He's the future Picasso! Get down here this instant. Your papers. Show me your passport right now. "Foreign language" what did you come here for? Kwong-ping and I are finished. I won't see him ever again, don't you worry! But I don't want to see you either. Go away! I loved Kwong-ping. I don't want to hear anything now! Get out! I knew Kwong-ping before Ah-sing. I loved him. I thought he loved only me. Later I found out I wasn't his only love, so I left him. When we were young, we went to school together. You're my best friend. If you had something to eat, you'd always save me the best part. Even when you bought ribbons, you'd give me the prettiest one. How can I ever forget how good you were to me? Ha-ching, there's a reason for everything. After I met Ah-sing, I found out he was Kwong-ping's friend. Then I decided that we were finished. But after you came to Paris and I saw you two together. I became jealous. Then I realized that I still love him. But I can swear that I will never again see Kwong-ping alone. I will never again come between you two. I want to marry Ah-sing and be good to him. Ha-ching, believe me! Forgive me! You must come to my wedding. Otherwise, I'll be miserable for the rest of my life. I'll be there. You managed to pack in a hurry! Well, you were my coolie. When I phoned Ah-sing, he was really pissed. He said I wasn't much of a friend, not going to his wedding. Can't you leave after Saturday? My friend's art school starts next week. He already mailed me the plane ticket. Since I agreed to teach there. I have to get to Hong Kong no matter what. Does Mei-lan know you're returning to Hong Kong? Not yet. I'll write her when I get back to Hong Kong. I wonder how she's getting along in the Philippines. I really admire you sometimes. These few years you've been like a lone warrior. When you're not painting, you're working. Mei-lan loves you so. And you're so serious. Just like a Saint. Don't joke. If she knew my one-man show didn't come off, she'd be very disappointed. Why think about that? Yeah, I was too naive. I believed everything people said to me. It's late. I'm going. Is this one of your posters? Yes! Give it to me as a souvenir. Take it. You can return it to me later. Hello? Hello, Rebecca. I'm phoning you from Lyon. I can't make it back to Paris tonight. The railway workers are on strike. Tomorrow I'll take the T.G.V. I should get to the church before 12:00. Wait for me there. Rebecca? Why are you so listless? It's nothing, see you tomorrow! Have you forgotten anything?
