(subway rumbling) (foreign language chatter) - New Yorkers can smell the inauthentic. When you try too hard. When you have corporate identities that try to make a better burrito or make a better egg roll. New Yorkers can smell the inauthenticity. And we can't have New York City be an inauthentic place. Excuse me, what's with the camera? Are you kidding me? I'm in an interview. Move on. Gotta be fucking nuts. (jazzy music) ♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh ♪ ♪ Paradise ♪ ♪ Take my hand ♪ ♪ I'm a stranger in paradise ♪ ♪ All lost in this wonderland ♪ ♪ A stranger in paradise ♪ ♪ If I stand starry eyed ♪ ♪ That's a danger in paradise ♪ - My name is Jan Lee. I'm a third generation Chinatown resident. My family's owned 19 and 21 Mott Street for three generations and I own and manage it. In my grandfather's day we were the first Chinese family in our building, so it was a lot of Italians and Jews. My father and his sister opened up Lonnie's Coffee Shop which was very very famous. It was a hamburgers and cheeseburgers and no Chinese food, but it was a great hangout for young Chinese Americans and Italian Americans and Jewish kids from the neighborhood. - Hi, how are you, Doctor? Good to see you. Well this Chinatown in New York has always been a gateway. And it's a gateway to millions of immigrants who continue to come here. All of our families really were adding their small part to building New York. One of the oldest businesses in Chinatown is across the street from me, our friends at Wing On. My family and their family have been across the street from each other for a hundred years, so we know each other well. - My wife Lorraine. Did I mention about the American dream that I lived? Well she's the girl next door. Met in New York Chinatown. On the Jersey Shore. Summering. - [Mei] Summering. - Yeah, summering. She gets embarrassed when I tell it. (Mei laughs) - My friend at the Thai market was chatting with me. I got greens. - You like this spicy? - [Mei] Don't do it too much. - You want to mix it? I don't have the strength. - [Mei] Sure, I'll do it. (phone rings) Can you answer and say Wing On Wo? - Wing On Wo. - Why they put so much scotch tape is beyond me. - Mom was like, "Grandma's doing something." That's why we have so much business. - I'm happy to be working for Mei Lum, my boss presently who calls me Gary. And when she wants me to do things as a superhero savior she calls me dad. All right, I'll push it over there. This is a good luck envelope. For coffee. From my heart to yours. It's not a winning lotto or anything, but it's just an appreciation. - Thank you, brother. - [Gary] Mei, out of all the other fifth generation family members, had the most connection with grandma and grandpa. And she was the most inclined to take the bull by the horns to keeping this legacy continuing on. - My view on Chinatown has always been through the storefront windows here at Wing On Wo. What makes Chinatown special is the strength and resilience of everybody here. Of opening up shop every day. Walking up five flights of stairs in their tenement building to go into their apartment. These storefronts, these legacy businesses holding all of these memories over the years and decades. To stay here and really dig in and build deep roots here. (dramatic music) - [Jan] Hi Pete. Hi. How are you? Since 1938 I've had the same restaurant family in our building. And so my family and their family have been doing business together for three generations. Anthony Bourdain was here. - Bourdain. - He stayed here. - Bourdain's been here about three times. - You've been working here since you were a kid. - [Pete] Teenager. - Teenager. - [Pete] Learning. - Yeah. - Back in the days when me and you were growing up, you knew all. - You knew the owner. - You knew mom and dad there. You knew the son or the daughter is there. You know the family's running the place. - Right. - And then, you know, if they were working for more than 20, 30 years you know the second generation of the family got the family business. We call this a family business. But you know what, family businesses are just going obsolete. It's dying. I'm second generation. If I decide to get out there's not gonna be no more. - Right, right. - 'Cause I don't have any backup. - [Jan] Are you fully staffed? - [Pete] No. - [Jan] No way, right? - [Pete] No way, I used to have 13 waiters. Now I only got five. - [Jan] Wow. - [Pete] And then the chefs, I used to have 18. Shoot, now I got coming in every day around six. So one-third as much. - Because of COVID we lost a lot of businesses in Chinatown, but also we lost the food. What do you think that that does to communities when you lose specific foods? There's certain foods like you and I grew up having that you can only get in Hop Kee right? So there's certain food that you can get in certain restaurants. - [Pete] Well from what I see, if you lose your neighborhood local foods you're gonna lose your neighborhood. (dramatic music) - In a lot of communities of color people don't understand that the landlords look like the people that they rent to. They rely on me for trust that I'm going to continue to renew their lease and I rely on them to be able to pay their rent at some point. Part of the building of the city is also renting to businesses that are contextual to our neighborhood. They're really what makes up the beauty of New York. - If you think about New York City Chinatown and where it's located, we're basically neighbors to a lot of very wealthy and affluent neighborhoods. That really makes Chinatown a neighborhood that the city wants to take back. To build up, to develop and become a place that they can make a lot of money off of. - You think I'll be around to see that place... (women laughing) Completed? - [Gary] For us we've declined any offers because this is our home. And this building, this store, the life we've lived here, it's like a living, breathing organism. - [Mei] Our situation here in New York City's Chinatown is not unique. I think a lot of Chinatowns in North America are confronting a lot of similar challenges. (dramatic music) (accordion and violin music) (metal door clanking) - Welcome to Wings. (machine whirring) Originally fortune cookies were first invented actually in the States. My father, he went to San Francisco and he saw the first version. He says I'd like to bring that up here, so we were the first to do bilingual fortune cookies. - [Crew Member] What's your favorite one? - I like Chinese food. (Garnet laughs) (50's bop music) ♪ Soon you'll be gone ♪ - You see that building in front of us? That's Wings Noodle. For us that is the heart of Chinatown. Any new immigrants that arrived here, they needed jobs, right? And Wings Noodle was the place that they would go to. They could turn to. There was the Irish and the Jewish and many other communities that passed through there. - Originally this was like a Jewish town. So my father, he says, "Maybe if we kosher-ize our products we'll sell a bit more." - This is a very special Chinatown. It's one of the rare francophone Chinatowns. - [Narrator] Most English speaking Canadians think of the Chinese in the traditional sense as a man who has learned to speak English with more or less of a funny accent. But listen to this. - Hello, Wong Wing. [In French] Yes, Jean! Three dozen? (upbeat music) - We used to play here, we used to eat here. There's so much that goes back. We'd like to see it continue. But you know. It's long hours. (dramatic music) I'm 63, my brother's 69. There are no next generations that's interested in working this type of business. It's emotional to think of actually selling, but at one point you have to say well, there's nothing left. (upbeat music) In the past 30 years, Chinatown has lost 90 percent of its residents. Construction of office buildings and the Convention Centre chased the Chinese from their neighbourhood which has been nearly abandoned since the restaurants closed. (song "Chinatown Blues") - During the so-called period of urban renewal in Montreal between 1960 and the 1980's there were at least 200 structures that were destroyed. We have to show tourists the real face of Montreal. - When they built Guy-Favreau, they took out one-third of Chinatown. It's going to be something really exciting that will revive the heart of Montreal. (song "Chinatown Blues") - [Walter] You have Complexe Desjardins. That was built. The Hydro-Quebec building. They're almost like tombstones. Beginning of the death of Chinatown. As the city develops... Chinatown is pretty much stamped out. - With the Wings Noodle block, it's in itself from an urban morphology point of view that you can see how it's actually survived this massive infrastructure surrounding it. - As you can see, everything else is being developed around Chinatown. That little bit is pretty much what's left. ♪ Chinatown ♪ ♪ Chinatown blues ♪ ♪ Chinatown blues ♪ - Now it's empty, everything. We had one year. No service. Before COVID, we don't have too much takeout. Because people like to sit down in dining room. It's just a feeling. They like the feeling. I've been a long time here. I want to keep it. But if the rental goes up. We cannot afford. We'll close. (dramatic music) History is history. So let the history go. Let the history go. Maybe in the future, another new Chinatown. - [Jessica] At different periods of history Chinatown went through growth and then went through decline. So the Chinatown's growth ebbs and flow. (wind chimes jingling) - Within the budding stage of a Chinatown it's the initial establishment. There is an initial purchase of a piece of property or the establishment of a restaurant, if you will, that becomes the center of the community. Now the blooming stage is how others are able to thrive in that community. - Post-war, immigration started to open up. Opportunities for people to settle in different places other than Chinatown opened up. And on top of that, urban renewal program and gentrification forced people to uproot and reroute. People start to move out to the suburbs. To raise family with a bigger land. So the sense of what is an ideal household place started to shift. - Fast forward to really the late 80's and 1990's you'll find communities that are much different. At the same time then you see some Chinatowns enter a withering stage. I think then it stands at a fork. And at that fork for that Chinatown are you able to move into the future. Or we're now talking about where it goes into this kind of extinction phase. And I think that that's really part of that discussion and that struggle of a lot of Chinatowns is - are these neighborhoods that should be put under glass, or do they have that ability to grow and thrive and change? And I think that that really is one of the big challenges as we see Chinatowns throughout North America - see that change. And some will indeed disappear, but others will and can thrive. And it's really I think to those who are the stewards of these Chinatowns that they can help steer it into these futures. Oh, you're here too. Replacing a wok. You want to buy another? It's leaking. Okay, thanks. - My name is William Liu and I'm second generation operator and owner at Kam Wai Dim Sum in Chinatown. 249 East Pender. (dramatic music) (sizzling food) Dim sum literally means a touch of heart and I do believe that every morsel that we create in our kitchen is a bit of love. (dramatic music) It really is a skill set. It's very very difficult to master all the different folds and all the different kinds of dumplings. You need to put love into your Dim Sum. I learned from a Dim Sum master. It's called the master filling! (group laughs) I've known William since he was a boy. He used to come after school and watch us make Dim Sum. - [William] I'd never really had that intense love for Chinatown until I started working with Kam Wai. If William is doing well, it's good for the family. If our children didn't take over then we couldn't continue. - Throughout my university years my dad was going through dialysis, he has kidney failure. At the time I was finishing up my bachelors in opera. I had my heart set out on moving to New York. I was doing auditions in New York. - Good, so the libera me, the sixth movement of the Faure requiem, features a bass solo. So we'll have William, and we'll use his voice as a kind of an inspiration and a guide for us in the way we sing to make those vowels so full and rich and tall. Just to run it right through from the top. Shall we stand please? (operatic foreign singing) - In the back of my mind I knew that if anything had happened I would come back immediately. And during my audition my dad had the opportunity to get a kidney transplant. So that's when I decided to take over the family business. (operatic singing) I'm okay in my life giving up something I love. For something that I love even more which is my family. - [Conductor] Bravo William. (group applauds) (dramatic music) - The neighborhood, the community here is in a dire situation. When the pandemic first hit, a lot of the businesses couldn't hold on in Chinatown and had to shut down. Chinatown's never gonna be the same. It's never gonna go back to what it was. All myself, my family can do is really just stay put where we are and try and run an honest business. (police sirens) (foreign chatter) (quiet music) - A few feet away from the park is where the city wants to build one of the largest vertical jails in all of the world. They want to demolish this entire enormous building and build a huge building as tall as the Statue of Liberty, over 350 feet tall. Right in the core of the community. And so we have to think about using this opportunity to amplify what's been happening in the media. - A lot of anger tonight in one of New York's most iconic neighborhoods, Chinatown. Anger over the city's plan to put a so-called community jail there. (crowd chanting "no jail") - Joining us now to discuss is Jan Lee, a co-founder of Neighbors United Below Canal. - Since 1838 we've watched jails on that same location be torn down and built up again and torn down and built up again. And every time that they built one, they built them bigger. And every time that they built one it was rife with more problems. There has been a pattern of dumping on not just Chinese communities, but dumping in Harlem, dumping in East Harlem, dumping in the Bronx. And why is that? Why do we live among the largest carceral footprint of the entire east coast of the United States? It's because Chinatown was never a desirable place to live to begin with. That's how it was designed. It was designed to corral Chinese people into an undesirable area. We're looking at facing years of demolition. Years of dangerous construction. Years and years of toxic dust that's going to be raised. Across the street from the jail there's hundreds of people. On the jail campus there's a senior residence. It's low income. Those people cannot leave. We will not survive 10 years of construction. The businesses, the community will not survive. - We come here to protect our community from you! (crowd cheers and applauds) From the city who want us out of this community! That is what you're doing! - This is really a battle for the soul of Chinatown. Not only here in New York City, but throughout North America. (police sirens wailing) (construction sounds) (church bell ringing) - [May] So just to let you guys know, technically we could be fined for this. We have to maybe do more fundraising. We're Chinatown Working Group. We are trying to save Chinatown. Hellow ma'am. How are you? - Okay, I suggest a couple of people try to get into the homes in here. One thing that has triggered a huge public response was the purchase of the Wings building by these huge developers who are very well known in Montreal and very well disliked for their practice of renovictions. And then we saw the condos being built right beside the arches. That's when it sounded the alarm to us and we thought oh my God, if we don't do something we're gonna lose all of Chinatown. This is a really good illustration of like a David and Goliath. I mean they're trying to fight, what, a multi-story, probably 100-condo development beside their little one, two story houses. - [Director] So this is your house right here, this wall? - Yeah. - [Director] And this is what you're facing every day? - So close. Full of dust here! - [Announcer] We're asking today why Chinatown matters at a time when it seems to be facing some existential threats. People who care about Chinatown say they are worried. - Now the developer is looking into purchasing connecting buildings. We think that they're trying to merge several plots of land into one huge development project. - [Man] The whole block is gonna be taken down for condo development. My fear is that my home is going to be destroyed. - In the face of all the economic pressure due to COVID, due to anti-Chinese racism, developers they come in, they prey on all these type of vulnerabilities. And if we don't fight back, if we don't organize as a community, that's how we're gonna lose everything. (traffic sounds) (crosswalk signal chirping) - Good deal on kiwi. Chinatown has been through a lot of changes over the years and is still going through a lot of changes. T&T just opened up yesterday. There's all kinds of development pressures in the community. In the Walmart universe these little operators can't operate, right? They get taken over and you lose all that innovation. And that's so important for small immigrant communities, for people trying to start out. Chinatown is the stepping stone into Canadian society. A lot of business owners have thrown in the towel. They're like, "I can't take it anymore." "Give me an offer", right? I understand that. If governments don't support these small neighborhoods, it's a disaster long term. The whole idea that you can move immigrant communities out to the far distance suburbs is absurd. It's not sustainable for climate change. It's not sustainable for people with low incomes. We need living communities downtown. And if it's not supported it'll disappear. (melancholic music) (car honking) (melancholic music) - You could say that this trope of dying, the disappearing Chinatown, part of that is actually in response to the desire for those who didn't like the Chinese. Those who were organizing around anti-Chinese politics, those who were exclusionists, those who were white supremacists, they wanted Chinatown to die. So the dead or disappearing Chinatown is ultimately wish fulfillment. We want to get rid of these people and therefore this symbol of them, this cluster of them, clearly this is Chinese because of the Chinese language signs, the businesses and who's running them, what's in the stores, we want this to die. If you want to get rid of the Chinese you train your bullseye, your target onto Chinatowns. - [Announcer] Construction of the new city hall destroyed half of Chinatown. And now big developers are moving in. - [Man] As far as I'm concerned, we're in the business of making way for progress. - We've had the understanding that most of Chinatown's been given to the new city hall. The rest of Chinatown will stand. - [Narrator] Most of Chinatown is now owned by developers. The small stores and restaurants are finding it hard to survive on land worth $100 a foot. - [Man] This is very valuable real estate situated just behind the city hall. - If they prefer the money they get, they sell it. This is a free country. - These patterns in urban development. All these urban renewals in non-white neighborhoods were always taking out what needs to be renewed. It's almost always the blight of non-whites. And so that pattern was across the board in North America, in every city. - When Vancouver's Chinatown was targeted for urban renewal programs, more than 11 blocks were taken out and more than 3,000 people got relocated. - It's a neighborhood which was seen as expendable that this is where you can put a freeway through Vancouver's Chinatown to obliterate it. For me the story of the disappearing Chinatown is one that has power precisely because it expresses the wish of those who want to erase Chinatowns. But also is an indicator of those who have pushed back and resisted that story. - [Announcer] Representatives from 29 Chinese organizations overflow the city council chambers in an organized bid to stop the steady erosion of Chinatown. - I'm pleading on behalf of myself and other members to please save Chinatown. - In the resistance against the freeway it was not only Chinese-Canadian but a multi-ethnic, multi-class type of social movement, you see the founding of contemporary Vancouver. And as such, begin the first discussions of sustainability in our cities. - We're not gonna see you destroy our neighborhoods with six, eight lane roadways crisscrossing the city. Turning it into an urban jungle. - There was this idea of coming together in this incredibly hostile environment that we're able to establish these collective goals. These moments offer the lessons for an urban future that we've perhaps lost. (police sirens wail) - Oh, there's a bit of a lineup. Hello! It's lunchtime. - Long time no see! Any babies on the way? - Not yet, very soon. - You say that every time, smart guy! - Haven't seen you in so long. We miss you a lot. - Thank you. - You're good looking too! He's so handsome, no? - You are beautiful ladies too! - Take off your mask so we can see you! - Take yours off! - You first! (laughter) - Yeah, so my great aunt, grandmother and grandfather all lived in the building at one point. I always like to highlight this. - [Director] Oh my God! - 'Cause no one has this view. - [Director] To think that they were gonna put a freeway through this neighborhood. Do you know where it was gonna go? - Oh yeah, so you can see the road there. That would go all the way across into downtown. Six years ago when I was looking to buy an apartment I was looking at a place in Chinatown. And my mom started bawling. She's like, "Why would you do that to us?" "Do you not consider our thoughts and feelings?" "Why would you want to go back to Chinatown?" And I remember, that still sticks with me, that they fought so hard, worked so hard to get out of Chinatown 'cause Chinatown's still really seen as that place you came when you first immigrated. That you made it by leaving Chinatown. And it always seems to be struggling. I think that's this age old story always. But that kind of echoes back to the formation of Chinatowns. 'Cause they settled here because they couldn't settle anywhere else. If you were at the margins, Chinatown was where you came. (50's old time music) - [Narrator] In most of the major cities of Canada there's one minority that usually chooses to live in a community. The Chinese. Many of them are over 60. They originally came from China in the early 1900's to work on the CPR out west. They're not permitted to bring their wives and children from China. And in some cases are condemned to a solitary existence on welfare. - I first got involved in Chinatown after I graduated from university in the 60's. Early 60's actually. My grandfather was here to build a railway. And after that he brought my dad over and paid a head tax. It was surprising when we first arrived in Canada. Most of the people were men. There were no children and no women. My dad married my mother in China. I was born in China. Because of Chinese Exclusion Act my mother and I did not come over until 1949. I was 14, so I had never met my father before that. - They passed a lot of exclusionary laws. Immigration exclusion, you know... Head tax made it punitively expensive to come here. My grandfather used to bring me down here. There was still a lot of what we call "Low Wah Kiu", the old timers. These men who had spent most of their lives without family, without women. He was in essence sharing me with these men who just didn't have kids, didn't have grandkids. And because of the exclusion of Chinese they ended up spending the last days of their lives only with each other. - At the turn of the century Chinese immigrants coming to Canada, coming to seek work, formed the Family Association as a mutual help society. So usually these are organizations that can offer protection, offer opportunities for employment. Basically they are the first wave of social service agencies in Chinatown. (foreign chatter) We're hanging with your relatives! - How about this? - My favorite. - [Director] My grandfather. - [Man] Your grandfather? - We're in the Wong Association right now. Were all the Wongs blood related? No. In fact one of the reasons why you would create an association around clan names is because it was a way to actually create fictive kin, fictive relationships where we need to help each other, we need to trust each other. Let's pretend we're family. - It's our origin story. Everything leads back to these places across Canada where the first Chinese communities built family, built community, built economies and put down roots. - All this is original. - These family associations, they are the stewards of Chinatown. They are helping to take care of Chinatown for the next generation to continue to enjoy it. - [Director] Oh my gosh. So beautiful. - [Man] Yep. We need to take a picture! (ping pong ball clicking) - There was a lot of pressure, and still is, for society to sell the buildings. We were approached by one architect. He said he's got $300 million to buy the 100 block East Pender. That's where most of the societies are. A developer met with me, he invited me for dinner. He said, "I have been here for five years." "I have never been to Chinatown." "We don't need Chinatown." And my answer to him was, "For you?" " It may be true." "You with your capital." "You can go all over the world." "But Chinatown is my family." My feeling is if we sell our forefathers will roll over in their grave. (footsteps thumping) (door creaks) - Our ancestors have worked so hard in such horrible times to form an association like this. It'll be a shame if it's lost. So the Mulan thing, the weight of the ancestors. It's hard. (Jeffrey laughs) We are more seen as wardens of the buildings. And it's always said that our responsibilities as the next generation is to keep these places running and standing, so that we can pass it on to the next generation. (dramatic music) - Over time, you do see community come out with different strategies. To make sure they can be protected. For San Francisco Chinatown after the earthquake, the government did try to relocate Chinatown. So Chinatown community at the time, they fought back and they started basically trying to assert a certain strong identity within the city and they come up with this architecture that's very different. With the dragon post, with the gate to mark the boundary... And it's become the Chinatown architecture. So that was the community strategy to make sure it stands out, it's unique, it's different, and it's here to stay. - I'm not against brand new buildings, I don't think any of us should be against brand new buildings, but creating meaningful places that matter often means understanding how the depth of meaning is amplified by the site. - If we want to see Chinatown continued, heritage designation is step one. And the heritage needs to be deeper than the architectural facade. It is including the intangible heritage inside the building, the activity inside the building, the way of life that we want to protect. - One. Two. Three. Four. Five. - All right. It's been a while since we did this. Let's try to not go crazy at the beginning. Let's just walk through the steps first. And then we slowly graduate up to full music. Raymond Wong, what are you doing? (group laughs) What are you doing? Why is Calvin holding two sticks? - One. Two. Down, wave. Turn around, stick up. Down down down down! - Dragon dance has been documented, and line dancing, as happening in the Han Dynasty. So we're talking about a tradition that we are carrying on that has lasted for almost two millennia. (rhythmic drumming) (gong ringing) (fast drumming) Excellent, excellent! All right, let's take a break everybody. (group chatter) We don't have places such as Hon Hsing and other venerable clubs like the Ma's Association of Canada, the Chan's Association of Canada, in Richmond or in Surrey. You can replicate a kung fu club in those places. But the hall you're in now, the building you're in now, was built in 1910. So imagine all the debates, all the discourse, all of the conversations that these walls hold. You just can't get that in a "New Chinatown." I'm lighting incense sticks. First bow. Second bow. Third bow. (dramatic music) (drumming parade music) (crowd cheers and applauds) (dramatic music) - [Director] So this is the kind of thing that you would do with your father-in-law? - Yeah, yeah, we'd get a shipment back in the early days. I'm married into the family over 40 years now. And back 40 years ago, they used to get their inventory in these wooden crates. And we opened up the faces, we took out the nails, the steel banding that I'm doing now. And watching father-in-law and not understanding why he would even venture to do what he's doing with these things. - [Director] He passed away this year, right? - (choked up) I say his name. And I. Get sad. It's crazy. I'm conjuring up my father-in-law as I'm doing this. No no no, your mask! Your mask! Move away, move away, it's too cold. - She has it. - I fell into depression when we had to lock our doors and not invite and welcome customers and visitors. It was my fountain of youth. And that fountain, that faucet, was shut. It was not a pause. It was full stop. (dramatic music) - I know that probably no lions are coming out this year is what I heard. There are no permits that were given. So that's kind of a clear sign that Super Saturday's not happening this year. - [Female Performer] Whoa! (tearing cloth) - Oh no! - Wow! The crop. - Crop fit. - I don't know about this. - [Female Performer] Yeah, it looks cool. - During a time when a lot of lion groups aren't able to come out for our usual Super Saturday we'll be coming out and, yeah, just bringing some joy and auspicious energy for opening the year of the Metal Ox. Perfect. Where, where, where? Over there? - We're outside of Mott Street Optical and we want to bless your store with our lion head. We're ready, we're ready! - [Female Performer] We're ready. (rhythmic drumming) (bells ringing) Gong Hei Fat Choy! (rhythmic drumming) (bells ringing) (laughing) (loud cheering) Gong Hei Fat Choy! - Yay, happy New Year! No no! No donation! We're good, we're good! He wants to give you guys tea. (speaking foreign language) - Happy New Year. - (in unison) Thank you, you too. (police siren wailing) - The NUBC lawsuit which was successful was overturned by appeal. And so that allows the city to roll in the bulldozers. They're going along with a project that was designed in 2017. And the world was different then. The city was different then, our community was different then. And to move ahead on schedule as though nothing is happening is the most irresponsible thing that the city can do right now. Many people don't know that this is happening so let them know this is coming. If you don't do something right now they're gonna roll in the bulldozers. And our neighborhood will be devastated. That's all you wanted, Sager? That's it, just satisfied. Okay, oh this is what it, okay. This is where it's at. - [Man] Sager is the... - The mascot. - Community Justice mascot. - Yep. Obviously taking the peaceful route. (protestors chanting "no new jails") - [Jan] Everybody sit down! This is what community looks like! - [All] This is what community looks like! - [Jan] This is what community looks like! - [All] This is what community looks like! - We're doing it for our community! We're doing it for our seniors! Right behind you is a senior living center! We're doing it for them! We're doing it for the residents! - [Officer] This is the New York City Police Department. You are unlawfully in the roadway and obstructing vehicular traffic. You are ordered to leave the roadway and utilize the available sidewalk. (protestors chanting "no new jails") - We do this for our small businesses! We do this for our seniors! (crowd chanting "Shame") (dramatic music) (cat meows) - [TV Reporter] The surge in hate crimes against Asian Americans only getting worse. We heard about a 52 year old woman attacked outside a New York City bakery on Tuesday. A 91 year old man pushed to the ground in San Francisco last month. - My view of what's going on outside the doors or the storefront of Wing On Wo. Anti-Asian hate and violence against Asians and it's happening all over the world. We're not always at the forefront of protests or resistance in the question of erasure, but we need to exercise our voice. (crowd chanting "stop Asian hate") - [TV Reporter] You have noticed the hashtag "stop Asian hate" trending on social media today. And that's because hate crimes against Asian Americans have skyrocketed this year. - [TV Reporter] Eight people, six of them Asian American women, were gunned down in Atlanta last week. - [News Anchor] Breaking news now, a racist attack in Chinatown. - [News Anchor] Here in New York City tonight police are searching for a suspect wanted for attacking an Asian woman with a hammer. - [Director] This past year, like a canary in a coal mine, Chinatowns across North America gave us the warning signs of the anti-Asian hate that was coming. Starting in January 2020, Chinatowns everywhere began to empty as racist rhetoric linking COVID-19 to the Chinese stigmatized the neighborhood. - Go back to China where you came from! - [Reporter] People looked around for someone to blame for the Coronavirus. Encouraged of course by Donald Trump and his anti-China rhetoric. - Kung flu. The Chinese virus. - From San Francisco to New York. Vancouver to Montreal. Residents and working class people in Chinatowns have faced verbal assault. Seniors and women have been attacked in the street and even set on fire. We are living in a moment that hearkens back to the anti-Asian era upon which our Chinatowns were built. (crowd chanting "stop Asian hate") Thousands from the Asian community are standing up! All of our allies from other communities who are marching with us! Thank you! (crowd cheers and applauds) - Chinatown is a symbol of our resilience, our solidarity, and our continued struggle for the right to remain in our neighborhood without fear of displacement. This is Chinatown. This is the house that we built. And our resistance is staying here still. (crowd chanting "this is Chinatown") (speaking in foregin language) (car door slams) - Since last year, the idea of nationalism is very strong. We were affected. - I was doing a delivery with my dad and there was a truck behind us that was very impatient and honking. He started threatening us with racial slurs and comes out of the car and punches my face. - It's scary. I've been in Chinatown for 40 years. The drug addicts might look scary but they are not violent. It's racist white people who are aggressive. (sizzling food) (door chimes) - $5.55. Everyone in the neighborhood, they want affordable food. The seniors are not gonna go to a restaurant that have $20 plates to eat, you know? Some of them, they go around collecting cans and stuff just to get their meals. I have people that come in sometimes and just ask for a bun because they're hungry and I'll just give it to them. Why not? If we have it, we're gonna give it. - One thing my dad has always said is you feed the masses, you don't feed the individual. And for us the masses are the people that surround us. From the downtown east side we rely on people that live in this neighborhood. Be it you drive a Mercedes or you drive a shopping cart, it doesn't matter to us as long as you are able to have food in your stomach. That for me is what Chinatown's all about. And for me I guess that's why it's important for us to be here. (choir harmonizing) - [Conductor] Yeah, we're not quite in tune yet. Start at the end. (piano music) (singing in foreign language) - [William] We're one of the last businesses in Chinatown that still have that Chinatown flavor. But it's so much more than flavor. It's the memories that go with the flavor. Our food can tie people back to Chinatown. (choir singing) (water splashing) - There we go. Lather it up. - Leave extra sauce okay? (group laughs) Oh my goodness! - This is awesome. - We wanted to galvanize some community spirit and just kind of see who's out there and who's thinking about Chinatown. The title comes from an old Toisan expression. I was thinking of when I was little with my mom I would go with her to Chinatown and she would bump into someone and say, "Long time no see." And I just felt like it was such a deeply kind of emotional expression. So coming to Chinatown, seeing an old friend, was one of the few things that really could reflect her humanity and make her feel like there was a place for her here. - One of the people I spoke to today, she said, "There is no more Chinatown." How does that make you feel? - Come down and see our exhibition. We've got 170 posters here of people saying I love Chinatown, this neighborhood means something to me. - Hi Brenda! Come come! Come take a picture with us! - That's all guys, thank you. - To me, when we talk about back to the city movement, if we can think of bring the community back instead of just bring people back, but bring that community connection to the place back, then if we manage to do that, then the intergenerational succession and planning will naturally take place. We can start to weave back this ruptured urban fabric and expand and grow. (singing bowl ringing) (singing bowl ringing) (background chatter) (doorbell ringing) - Welcome! - This is my godfather. Are you from Toisan? - My family name is Seto. - He's a Seto too. - My parents are from Kaiping. - You're from Chikan, Kaiping right? - Me too! - They're from the same village! (group laughs) - They don't want that. Take some! So everyone can feel sweet! - Out of courtesy, we take one. - Okay, wonderful. Have a sweet day. - So all this money is to eventually go to building their new temple. But they would like somewhere downtown where it's convenient for the older Chinese population to continue going to. Are you worried about developers buying up the area? You better translate, Wilson. - Okay, he said yes. (group laughing) He said yes, he's worried. - [Announcer] Talking about Chinatown, advocates calling for the city of Montreal to act immediately to protect Chinatown's heritage. We've got a lot of condo buildings going up, a lot of interest in more condo buildings, we are literally running out of time on this. - [Man] I'm the vice president of the Chinese Association of Montreal. And our building is smack in the middle of this proposed project, but I want to make it perfectly clear that our building is not for sale. - In a lot of the promotion of those new condo complexes, it doesn't mention it's Chinatown? - No. (Walter laughs) There's not one word, okay, on Chinatown, and that's very worrisome. We're worried about being wiped out. - I think a lot of us just assumed that they would never go away. I think that's how we felt about Wings. - As soon as it was purchased the tenant sounded the alarm publicly. He went to the media. I got involved in this fight once my home was sold. For the protection of these buildings. And I stand with my friends in this fight. - One of the tenants discovered some artifact that dates back to over 200 years. - I can't face this idea in my mind that these things will end up in the garbage. That's a chunk, a big chunk of the history of Montreal and Quebec history. So I think this is important. - [Man] We desperately need to have the government declare Chinatown as a heritage destination. - [May] You know, it's in times of crisis that things move the fastest. And so now we're all working together to recognize the entire Chinatown area as a historical neighborhood that is worthy of protection. - [Reporter] A first in Montreal's Chinatown, a municipal election debate hosted by organizations from the city's Chinese community representing about 100,000 Montrealers. - How are you going to protect the quality of life and our ability to stay in our homes? (audience applauds) There's Chinatown for regular folks. Then there's the Chinatown for rich developers. And I have the impression that we care more about the latter than the real residents. (audience applauds) - I am telling you now, if you're not united today. In 20 years time we will not have a Chinatown like what it is today. (audience applauds) - No matter what language we speak, no matter what dialogues we talk, we got to unite it together. - I'm not gonna apologize that we ran over time. (audience laughs) We waited 200 years for you guys. (audiences cheers and applauds) (dramatic music) (kids shouting playfully) - This is Columbus Park. For those of you who don't know, one of the most used parks on the east coast of the United States. 50 feet away from this park is where the demolition of those two buildings is gonna take place. It's gonna plunge this community into darkness. We are here, we are not invisible, and we're saying no new jails! (protestors chanting "no new jails") - No new jails! No new jails! - We don't want no jail here. We're tired of all the violence. Against our elders. Against Asian people. We're tired of that shit. Fuck that. I came from California to help support this. - No new jails! - [Jan] This is pretty good huh? - You got a lot of people. - Couple of thousand, I think. Maybe more. We are not invisible! We are not invisible! When Mayor Koch in the 1980's saw 12,000 people from this community marching in the same streets he said "I don't care." "You don't vote, you don't care, you don't matter." Now we're here. We cannot repeat that history. We are here, we are not invisible, and we're saying, "no new jails!" (protestors chanting "no new jails") We have little progress. And the little progress that we have was because of the community. We're putting pressure on all of the government because people need to get elected again. People want to stay in office. We're gonna hold them responsible if they move ahead with this jail. We're gonna remember who they are. We're gonna come out and vote. We're gonna make sure that everybody votes against them. That's the power that we have. Stop this jail! Stop this jail! Does that mean that this jail is stopped? No. We had over 2,000 people walking all the way through the streets of Chinatown. If we have to do it again we'll do it again. Thank you. Thank you very much. You guys made a real difference for us. I saw you out there. - We got your back. (protestors chanting "no new jails") - Getting the hang of this. - Yeah. - Getting good. - [News Reporter] A portion of Montreal's Chinatown has been declared a historic site, meaning future development in the core of Chinatown will need provincial consent. Two historic buildings are set to get heritage status. The S. Davis and Sons building and what's now known as Maison Wings. Today is a big moment for Montreal's Chinatown community. - Okay come! Press conference people, come! You know, human beings live here! And this is what they see! Can we start the press conference? Move aside, we're laying down plywood. Just back up a bit. This is our home. We don't have to move from our home! You're being chased from the area? This is his property. - We hope that the interim measures announced by the government this morning that will be put in place will be sufficient to prevent projects such as this disaster from ever happening again. We hope this is only the beginning of full heritage protection for Chinatown. Which is composed of both tangible and intangible assets. Chinatown is a nesting place of living heritage such as our seniors who hold our memories of struggle and survival here. Chinatown is the home to our family associations, residents, legacy businesses that are important to the identity of all Asian communities. Chinatown is not a museum! We live here! We demand quality of life! (crowd cheering) - We know it's one block. It's not over, and we know it's not over, but that is a fucking huge victory, man. I am super happy. - Hey, victory! May, we did it for real. We got them, the fuckers, the developers. (dramatic music) (dishes clanking) (food sizzling) Hello! What rice rolls are you missing? No more fried noodles, right? - Today my feeling is very good. It's the first re-open. All the people have hope for the future. It's good day. (chatting in foreign language) - [Gary] So opening the doors this past weekend was like me coming out of the crate and beginning again. The water flowing again between us as people. - My ears aren't pierced. - How are you gonna wear them? - (laughs) I'm gonna get my ears pierced. - Wow! - And then in the meantime I might switch them off... - [Man] Having a good time being the bouncer? - Who's the bouncer? - [Man] You're the bouncer here at the door. - Oh. Yeah. I take care of the little things. I'm not good with people. - We're at our next stop, Wing On Wo. So this is actually the oldest shop in Chinatown. It opened in 1890. So Mei Lum is the fifth generation owner of Wing On Wo. And she really supports local artists. She has an artist residence. (foreign dance music) - I think there's something to say about not wiping spaces out to replace them with something new, but the real work is in trying to understand what has worked, what is significant, what is still relevant, and how to breathe new life into it. - You know, I brought up the conversation about who would like to continue. I feel, unaware to her, that she recalled her promise to grandfather. (choked up) Never to let it go. So here we are. Continuing. (piano music) We're here in America, fifth generation Chinese American, and we've developed home here. So nobody's gonna kick us out of our house. This is our house. I, for one, don't call it resistance. I call it staying where you belong. (dramatic music) (faint cheering) (dramatic music) (drumming) - [Man] You could say each fight that was an existential fight for Chinatown was generational. You know, my kids will have to figure out what it means. All our generations to come will have to figure out what this place means. But as long as it's important enough to have meaning - that to me is a reason to fight for it. (soaring dramatic music)
