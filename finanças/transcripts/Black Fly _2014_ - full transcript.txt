Your face looks like pizza. - Whisper in here. - Whisper. Why? Is it Marcus? Bag of shit can kiss my ass for all I care! Hey, you little fucker! - Jake! Hey! I didn't mean to clip you! Listen, I ain't no queer. - I never... I didn't say that! - Where you goin'? Huh? Cop house? - No. - Good. 'Cause nothin' happened, you understand? Nod at me if you understand! Now come on. Fuck! Fucker! You better run, Jake! I'm gonna make your fuckin' ass bleed! - I think I'll be down there in a day or two. Yeah, I know. Yeah, it's been a while. Thanks, Noel. Bye. Bye. - Jake! - Jesus, you scared the shit out of me! Maybe that's why you look so damn skinny! Oh, look at this! Nice shiner, buddy! You should see the other guy! - My brother! Little fuckin' scrap! Look at you! Must have grown a foot and a half since I saw you! - So, how's the house? - Oh, yeah, I've been fixing it up real good! Got my girl Paula helping me with it. - I guess that means that Jill what's-her-face is gone. - Yeah, well, we crashed and burned couple of years ago. Yeah, that's funny, 'cause I remember something about you two getting engaged. - Oh, Jesus Christ! She was nice, but, uh, no, you saw what she looked like. - She wasn't that bad. Oh, come on! I was trolling for flounder with that one! Fuck! - Guess you're getting ready to spawn? Oh, yeah? My little brother's all grown up if he knows about spawners, huh? That's my girl! And this little ball of fur here is this guy. He's Jesse. Hey, buddy, how's it goin'? Jake, this is Paula. - Hi. - Hi. - Noel told me you're quite the artist. - Uh, I draw a bit. It's mostly comics. - Come on, Jake. Let's get you inside. Before Paula asks if she can model for ya. My old bedroom. - Yeah? Yep. - Sweet. Like it! Thanks. Here. Put those in your back pocket. - It's a key to the house? - Spare keys to the truck. - Yeah, but I don't have a license. You're a Henson, ain't ya? Welcome to the island, buds. Oh, hey, do you eat salmon? - Sorta. Not much of a fish eater. You will be! See you downstairs! Just like that, best friends for life! - You had a little brother all this time? Still do. - Never cease to amaze me. - I told you we'd been out of touch. Best damn thing that boy coulda done is come back to his roots. Jake! Wake up, bro! You don't get out of bed, I'll tie you to the hood and the deer will get the front seat. Let's go! How far are we going? Until we find somethin' to shoot! You tiring out on me? No, I'm good. He get you? Yeah. Thought all the black flies would be dead by now. - Yeah, well, little fuckers should be. There's always a few who are too mean to die. Or maybe they're just stickin' around to feed on your misery. - I'm having fun! - Yeah, sure you are. Hey, see that clearing up ahead? That's where our mother shot her first deer. - Mom killed a deer? She sure did. Tom took her hunting all the time. He even bought her a rifle for her 21st birthday. You're making it up! - No, it's true. I swear to God. - So what happened? - Well I'm not gonna say another God-damned word if you're gonna doubt me! - I won't doubt you! Well, Mom and Dad were a little further along the path than we are now. Dad goes into the bushes to take a leak, when a white tailed deer leaps right out onto the path. So, she raises her 308 Savage Lever Action and she takes a beat. Tail, head, tail, head, tail, head, tail, head. And then she fires. Dad must have pissed his pants when he heard that shot. And 120 yards away, the bullet hits just below the tail, smack-dab in its ass-hole! The bullet travels in a straight line through its hump and directly into the back of the deer's skull. It explodes like a watermelon. - The head exploded. - Mom said you could pick up both halves of the antlers with nothin' in between. Holy... You're yanking my chain! - I got the antlers to prove it - Hey, Noel? How come you took down all the photographs? - What photographs? - Family pictures. I got a box of them in my room. - Must have just been cleaning house. 'Kay, come here. Peanut butter sandwiches, compliments of Paula. - She's a nice girl. - You think so, huh? - Yeah. This place is a little piece of heaven. Few neighbors. Lots of space. Beautiful scenery. Sure beats living with Uncle Marcus. - Is he the one who hit you? - Yeah. - Doesn't know you're here, does he? - No. - So you just walked away? - Pretty much. - What about school? School ain't going anywhere. I can go back when I'm ready. - I can respect that! Here. 'Kay, we're gonna do a little target practice. Take that can down to that stump. Which one? - Right down there. - That good? Perfect. Lookie here. - I've never done this before. - Well, I'll walk you through it. Lie down right here. Take a beat on the can. 'Kay, now make sure it's snug. There you go. - Me. Too. - 'Kay. Now relax! Make sure the head is locked down on the stock. Breathe normal. Good. Now pause. Then shoot. I knew it! It's in your blood! Fuckin' bull's-eye. Buds! - I think I broke my shoulder. Yeah! Come on! Yeah! - Jake? Is that you? - Yeah. - Get back here. I know what you were doing. And I hope you got a good look 'cause it better last ya. Now go. Want another egg? - No thanks. I'm stuffed. - Uh. We'll get somethin' on the road. You in a rush? - Yep. Come on. Jake. This Henson's gotta work. You're forgetting somethin'! - See ya! - Bye. Paula. - She was the top of the legion when she shot the head off that deer! Your old man. He would never admit it. Hey. What was he like? - You know. Most fishermen, they put in six weeks. They pull a pooch on poagie? Oh. Wait, give me a hand! Oh. You got it? Not him. He was a straight businessman. Right to the bone. I got it. - Oh. Yeah? You got all this. Huh? - He's got it. Look at that! - Nice break him in. - I think he got more work done today than you did. Steve! Come on. Jake, let's take a load off! Beer? Beer? - Yeah. - Hey. See Steve over here? What about him? - Well. When I was a kid, I used to hang out at the MacNeil farm 'cause they were the only family with a pool. No offense. Ken. One day. Me and Steve are wrestling on the front lawn in our tight little bathing suits. Yeah. And out comes Old Rex and he gets real excited. Rex was one of these huge Newfoundland dogs and hung like a fuckin' horse. Well. Next thing I know, Rex comes out and he jumps up on Steve and he mounts him from behind! Steve is pinned tight! Rex starts humpin' away. His big. Red, wet dick slappin' up against Steve's back. And Old Rex is just pumpin' away like this like there's no tomorrow. And then he just blows his wad all up Steve's back. Aw. Dang, kids can be mean. We told everybody! Ain't that right. Doggie boy? - I'm okay! It's okay. Yeah. I'm okay now. Oh. God, that was funny! - Well that's right. That's why sometimes this old boy needs to be reminded who's boss! It's our day. Bud. Boys. Ken. Anytime. - Thanks. Bud. - Yeah. Steve? Yeah. Fuck off. Fuck you! It was nice to meet you guys! - You too. Bud! Yep. Jake. Don't work to hard. - He's a Henson. What's wrong with Ken? Cancer. Doctor gave him less than a year to live. That's not very long. No. It ain't! - Why didn't you come to town after Mom died? - Didn't wanna leave. Hell. I never want to leave. Everything I need is right here! - Yeah. But... - But what? - What about me? - Listen. I know I should've kept in touch. I guess I thought you'd be better off not having me around. It was stupid of me-- - Yeah. It was! - I know. And I'm sorry. I've made mistakes. Jake. Not staying close? That was one of them. But. Hey, I've grown up and you've grown up. What matters is that we're together now. You'll be fine. Just stay here. Hey. Hank! Boys! Who the fuck are you? Just a neighbor. Well. Neighbor, you best fuck off! - Listen. Uh. I'm sure this bike must mean a lot to you, but. Uh, crackin' poor Hank's skull here ain't gonna fix it. Who said I was just gonna crack his skull? - Hey. Listen, I'm not lookin' for any trouble. - You okay? Yeah. - Come on! - Thought he was gonna stab you. Sure as hell fuckin' tried! Sure you're okay? - Yeah. - Let's not mention this to Paula. - Well. They coulda killed us! What about the cops? - No. No, no, no. No cops. Jake. It's best if we keep this whole thing to ourselves. Hey. But what you did back there. You had my back. Jake. That meant a lot to me. Look at that. Damn near took his head clean off. - You're drunk. - What did you say to me? - It's funny I... I didn't even know Noel had a brother until you called. - I guess Noel is not one to talk about his past much. - Noel's not one to talk about his past at all. - Our father died in a hunting accident. Mother committed suicide soon after. I got left with my uncle. - I'm sorry. Do you remember your mom and dad at all? - Sometimes I wonder how well I even know Noel. I only saw him a few times up until I was 12. In the last four years we just send post cards. - Well. Sounds like you two need to get reacquainted. Have you been down to the basement yet? - No. - Come on. It's about time all these things were hung out. - What do you mean? - Considering most of them were shoved into boxes. They're in real good shape. Your mom had some real pretty clothes. I figured it was worth it to keep it all. - How come? - 'Cause it's a part of you and Noel. And now that you're back here. Maybe he'll wanna dig it all up. What? - Nothing. What? - You just look like my mother. - Jake. That's a little weird. - Sorry. - Here. A little tip when wearing a trucker hat. Just... gotta lock it in place. - Thanks. Come on Stevie. I'm asking you to leave. Damn it. Steve! Jake's gonna see! Please! C'mon, you look so hot right now. - 'Kay. Fine. - What's Noel doing up island? - Yesterday. A couple of local boys found some guy in the moonshine mill. - So what does Noel do? - Takes care of it. I guess. - Noel and I had a run-in with some bikers yesterday. - Why didn't you tell me? - Noel didn't wanna worry you. - That's Noel! Always getting into trouble and always lying about it. Hey. Jake? - Yeah? Don't pet the dog when it's chewing. You might lose a finger. Hey. How was your day? Fine. Jake and I went through some stuff in the basement. It's all junk anyway. It needs to be thrown out. He asleep? Yeah. Hmm. - Hey. Noel. - Yeah? - Can I take the truck? I want to head into town. Maybe try some fishing. - You're missing the MacNeils. Coming by in a half hour. - Guess it'd be rude to miss them. Fuck it. Go have fun. Hey. So Jake! Did Paula have any visitors yesterday? - Steve stopped by. I tell you. I'm dyin'! - You'll live forever. Kenny. - It's 'cause of them boiler jobs. I used to come home everyday. It'd take me half an hour to scrape all that black shit out of my nose. - The same fuckin thing happend when me and Dad used to work at the old crematorium. Takin' out all them fire bricks. You remember that Dad? That was disgusting. - After pulling everything apart. Covered in ash from head to toe from all the burnt bodies. - That's fuckin' bullshit. Stevie. That's just the rock dust. All the ashes get scraped in them coffee tins. - It's the truth. Henson! It's the sickest fuckin' job I ever had to do! - Pass me another beer Tom. - Tom's dead. Ken. - Did I just call you Tom? Oh. Jesus Christ. The stupidest things come out of my mouth. Well we need to have a toast in memory of Tom and Christine! - No no we do not, Ken. - It's been 10 years since that horrible day. We never made a toast to your parents. And we're puttin' it to rest! - No. No, no! Let me do this! To Tom and Christine Henson. God cut their lives short. I know He had His reasons. Some higher purpose why He did it. And now they are angels in Heaven looking down on us. And they are proud of their two boys! They were the nicest most genuine people I ever met. The two best friends I ever had! Tom and Christine! This is for you! Cheers! I gotta take a piss right here. - No. No, no! Not in here! - No. No, no, no! Whoa! No no no no! Don't do that. That was. Just take it easy on him. That fat tub of shit brings it on himself! - You don't have to call him "fat tub of shit"! Don't call him that! - Did Ken used to breastfeed you Stevie? It's fuckin' unnatural the way you two stick up for each other. - Well he's my dad. - No shit. - Well wouldn't you stick up for your dad? - My daddy's dead. - Well just lay off mine. That's all. - You wanna hit me with that don't you? - What? No. Why would I want to do that? - 'Cause you do. - You're fucked. I don't wanna hit anybody with anything. - Hit me. - I'm not gonna hit you! You know what? This is. I gotta go. I think this is-- - What? No. No, no, Stevie, Stevie! - It's time. - It's all right. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Hey! You don't have to leave. You don't have to leave! Just sit down and have another beer. - No! - Don't leave. Sit down and have a beer. Sit down. Have a beer. I'll get the beer. And you sit down. You sit down. - Sit down! There. There. It's for you. - That's for me. - And this is for me. I just. I have one question for you. - Yeah. Did you fuck Paula? - No. I didn't, I-- Steve. Look at me. - I didn't f-- - Look at me. - I gotta go. This is fucked! You're not goin' anywhere! Paula. Get in here! Did you fuck him? - What? - Did you fuck him? - No! He tried to. - You're a fuckin' backstabber! - No. No, no! Paula! Get in here! - It's gonna be all right. It's gonna be all right! - He broke my teeth! He broke my teeth! I know. I know. Okay. I'm sorry. Ken. - I caught a fish! It's big! It's actually fucking huge! Is everything all right? - That idiot. Steve, cut himself on a broken bottle. Is he okay? He'll be fine. Paula. Stay here. Noel! - Hey! This is private property! Stay the fuck off my land! This island is getting too damn crowded. - Noel. Let's go. - You go inside. Jake. No. Haven't seen him in, Christ, goin' on four years now. No. No phone calls, nothin'. Yeah. Well, Eva and me, we're just. Uh, worried. He was real upset over somethin'. - Yeah. Well, Jake's a tough kid. I'm sure he'll be fine. I'll tell you what. If he shows up. I'll have him give you a call. Thanks. Noel, I, I really appreciate that. We just wanna get him home safe. - Yeah. You and Eva take care now. Asshole. So. Jake, maybe you could do a portrait of Paula here. Hm? Of course. She'd have to show some pride. At least wear fuckin' makeup! Is there a reason why you look like shit? Oh. That girl has low self-esteem, Jake. - Maybe she's just under a lot of stress. - She doesn't have a fuckin' clue what real stress is! How do you think we met? - I don't know. Through friends? - Through friends? He thinks we met through friends! No. It was eight-ball night at the town pump, Jake. A john was tryna break her jaw. So I broke his arm. - She was selling herself? - Yeah. Old Paula doesn't have much in the way of talent except for. Uh... You want a beer? - No thanks. So you think about our parents a lot? - A little. I guess. I remember things. Some things I don't remember much. The day Dad died. - Yeah. Well, I remember. It's why I can't look at their faces. It's why I took all these pictures down. - It wasn't your fault they died Noel. - Dad was my fault. - It was an accident. - I pulled the trigger. Drink your beer! Paula. I swear to Christ, open up the fuckin' door! Come on. Paula! Open up the door! Open up the door. Paula! Get the fuck out of bed and get to this door right fucking now! Let me in there! You're gonna get up and open this door! Paula! Paula. Let me in there! Hey boy. Hey. - Paula. Open up the door now! Paula! Paula! Open up! Hey. Jake, you in there? How's everything goin'? - Fine. Just reading. - Now. I know everything's not fine. Well. Me and Paula have been fighting. You bored? - I'm okay. - No. Come on. Grab your jacket. Where are we going? - We got some things we gotta do. You know. After today, we're gonna have to lay low for a while. No phone calls no one leaves the house. These fuckin' bikers are up to no good. - Maybe I should leave. - Well after we drop off the garbage, we'll stop by the farmer's market. Grab some breakfast. How does that sound? Not very hungry. - You sure? Kathy Miller has this grill set up there. Throws together these huge egg and bacon sandwiches! Got big tits! You know. When I was your age, I used to come up here looking for bright shell casings from militia target practice. I would set up right behind that barn. Get in there. Two cents for every shell casing I found! Shit I would do for beer money. Good. Now let's go eat. Walk! - I told you to stay off of my land! You afraid of me? You're gonna be! Oh. What now? You're running from me. Huh? - Jake? Stay the fuck away from us! - Jake. - What do they want from us? - Payback. I guess. - Hmm. I should have left him when I had the chance. - Why didn't you? - I was afraid of what he would do? - Paula. What happened to Steve and Ken? - There wasn't any fight. It was like slaughtering a deer! - Why did he do it? - I don't know. Because of you and Steve? - You saw? - Yeah. - Did you tell him? - What was I gonna say? What was I gonna tell my brother? Huh? - I want you to know something. Jake. What happened between me and Steve isn't what you think. He was blackmailing me. Threatening to tell Noel about some fling I had. Noel'd wanna kill me if he found out! What if he comes after us? Huh? What if he tries to kill me? Will you protect me? Will you? Will you protect me? - Noel! Hey. Dave, what brings you sniffing around? Oh. Your neighbors. Those bikers have been causing some trouble. Gettin' a lot of complaints lately. - Yeah. I believe it. Last few days. They've been riding up and down my road. - Oh. Probably just lookin' to scare you off the island like everybody else. - Want a beer? - If that's a bribe. It better be a cold one. I heard somewhere they got a football field of weed supplies half the west coast. I'll give you two beers if you shut that down. Don't you worry we will. Just a matter of time. Cheers! That's good. Oh. Hey, you seen the MacNeils lately? - Nope. Not since a couple weeks. Stopped by the house to check in on Old Kenny. But no MacNeils. - Oh. They never stray too far. They mention anything about any trouble? - Just a few stare-downs. - You know. Steve pushes back, he's gonna get hurt. These boys. They, they don't fuck around! - Yeah. Well, they can try and push me around all they want. I ain't moving. Too many fond memories of island living. You know. When I was six years old, I got up one morning to get a few eggs from the chicken coop. Well. I walk over there. There's a hole in the chicken wire. Blood. Feathers. And my dog Scruffy with a dead chicken hanging out of her mouth. See. Scruffy had killed about a dozen chickens, mangled another seven or eight. When you're six years old. It's pretty traumatizing, seeing your dog turn into that. So I screamed for my old lady. She comes runnin' out this door. Sees what happened. Picks up a board and lays the beats to Scruffy. And then me and her pick up the rest of the mangled chickens still squawkin' and stuff them into a garbage bag. Now. My mom has no idea what to do, 'cause my dad already left for work. So she decides to tie this bag of dying chickens to the muffler of the truck. So the exhaust fumes will put 'em all to sleep and kill 'em. Anyway. I'm standing behind the bag when she turns on the ignition. And the bag starts to fill up. 'Cause the fumes have nowhere to go. Well. I'm watchin' as the bag gets bigger and bigger and bigger. And boom! Exploded in my face! What the hell was the point in telling me that story? I think. I think I missed that! - Just another fond memory of country living! Kind of fucked up. Man! He's gonna kill him. - Why would he do that? - He's asking too many questions. No! - Paula stay here. - I'm presuming that your dad had to put the dog down? - Had to! Once a dog gets a taste for blood. It ain't gonna stop. So we shot the dog, cut off a few heads and ate chicken for a month. Hi. Constable. Hi. Yourself! Who are you? - Jake Henson! He's my younger brother. - Oh. Didn't know you had one! Nice to meet you! - What do you want Jake? - Just hanging out. - Constable Dave is just joining me for a beer. - I didn't know officers drank. - You're right! I've been corrupted enough! Oh hey, have you seen Ken and Steve MacNeil lately? - Well I know Ken's sick. Maybe he went to the hospital. - Yeah. I think I remember hearing him say something about having to go in. - What his cancer? - Yeah. It's a damn shame. All right. Well, if you boys see anything. You be sure and let me know. Noel? Don't go steppin' on any toes. - You know me. Dave. I don't dance. - Nice to meet you. Bye. Officer. - You stay safe. Dave. - Will do! You boys take care. - Use your fuckin' head! Did I say you could come out of the house? No. But-- - Get back in there. - Jesse! You seen Jesse? - Not since last night. - Jesse! Come here. Jesse! Jesse! Fuck! - Hey. Sam. If you could just fill it up for me. - Sure. - So. How's, uh, how's business been treating you lately? - Past few months. It's real slow. Like a. Like a graveyard around here. - Hm. Sorry to hear that! - Me. Too. - Hey. When was the last time you saw Ken and Steve MacNeil? - Oh shit. Uh maybe three days ago? - Oh yeah? What were they up to? - Uh you know, pickin' up cough candies and pretzels. - They say where they were headed? - Yeah! Henson house. - You sure? - Sure! I ask everyone where they're headed. Stevie in some kind of trouble? What? No, no, nobody's in any trouble. What do I owe you? - 17 bucks. - There you go. You forgot to ask me where I was goin'! No I didn't! Say hi to the boys for me! - Will do. - You have the keys? Where are they? Give them to me! - Paula where you gonna go? Where you gonna go? The one ferry left this morning! We have no boat! - He's gonna kill me Jake! - He's not gonna kill you. He woulda done something by now if he knew! - I'll leave with or without you. Get away from me! - Come on Paula, we gotta wait. - No. No! - Paula listen to me, no! Paula! Hey! - Stay out of it! What the hell is this? Noel! - I said stay out of it. Jake! Jesse's dead! The bikers fucking killed him! I'm sorry. I-- - Don't you fucking talk to me! Jacob! We are going hunting! If you leave me. I will kill you! - Noel! - Okay from this point on, not a fuckin' peep. - Put the gun down. Noel. - Let me tell you something little brother. In order to take control of your life. You must first take control of your home. That's all this is. Just a big clean-up. You know I'm right. Now when we're done here today. You can go back to hidin' behind your toys and your fuckin' sketches. But now you stand by me! - No. - Stand by your family. - We're going home. Noel they're gonna see us. - Stand by your family. Be a Henson. Be a man. - Fuck! You hear that? Fuck! Fucking motherfucker! Thought I could trust you! You're walkin' home! Where the fuck is he? God damn it. Jesus! - Paula get your ass down here. We gotta talk. I said right fuckin' now! You don't want me comin' up there. 'Cause I'm havin' a real bad fuckin' day! - Drop it! Okay! Nice and easy nice and easy! Okay. - All right. Slower slower! - You know me. Dave. - Just put it on the ground. On the ground. All right put your hands on your head. - You got me! You got me Dave! All right shut up-- - I'm not the one at fault here Paula! I just want to talk! And you don't fuckin' listen! You just keep fuckin' around! Paula listen to me. There's no one left to trust here. Paula! Somebody out there Paula? Hm? How many? - Oh. Please, please don't kill me! - You best go hide real fuckin' quick! - Please tell me he's dead! - I don't know. But I'm gonna find him. - You never shoulda touched Jesse. He never did nothing to you! - Noel! No more killing! - They skinned my fuckin' dog! I said no more killing! - So what are you gonna do Jake? Are you gonna shoot me? You're gonna kill your own brother? After all I did for you? You did nothing for me! - I took the blame! I protected you! - No! No. - He was gonna kill me. And you. You know that, don't you? Walk back to the truck right fuckin' now!
