[light music] [light dramatic music] [man] I can almost guarantee you, at some point in your life, you will be asked the following question: Do you believe in God? Now for me, the answer is undoubtedly, yes. How did I come to that conclusion? Well, it involves some faith, some hope and some love. Oh, yeah. [chuckles] And some dancing.

Oh, yeah, I guess I wasn't too good, was it? [chuckling] I woke up on Sunday and saw him crying downstairs. That was your mom's three-year memorial service. I've seen him cry other times too. Well, you want me to talk to him? No, I need you to talk to God. Well, what would you like me to tell God? Well, this studio I dance at is having a fundraiser tonight. It's for a pro and schmo dance contest. I want my dad to enter. So you want your father to enter this contest so he starts to get out a bit, huh? Well, yeah, and my dance instructor would be the person he'd be dancing with. I think he'd be happy if he gets to know her. I'll say a prayer, and we'll leave everything else up to God, okay? [man] Hey, hon, I was wondering where you went. Ah, she's all set. Okay, come on sweetie. Everything okay? Hey, hey, gang. Sorry, I can't make it tonight. I gotta go to a school fundraiser. You know, I'm not keeping track or anything, but you missed the last two days of Bible studies. How would you know, Harry? We didn't go either. Ah, I got my sources, people talk. All right, Mr. Keratas. I'll make sure I'm here next week, okay? Just saying. He keeps attendance. All right, all right. Who was that? ♪ I must confess when our world is stressed ♪ ♪ I feel like dancing ♪ ♪ The whole night with you ♪ ♪ And when I do, do, do, do, do, do ♪ So, I hear your studio needs to be rescued. Well, we have to get the building retrofitted or the city will close us down. If we win the contest, the $25,000 will help us retrofit the building. So, you and me tangoing for a couple of months. Practicing. Whatever anyone bids, put me down for 100 over it. Mm-hmm. -Hi. -It's Gerald Hogwood II. He's Daddy Hog One. -Hi. -Howdy. Yeah, I'm his Daddy and his dance advisor. Why don't you show her a little something, Hog II. Okay, check this out. It's like 180 degrees, that split right there. Left leg pointing towards Los Angeles, right foot to New York. Grand plie, whoa, whoa, didn't even spill a drop of wine. -Yeah. -Okay. -And we've got killer choreography. Great, thank you. Thank you so much. -Zip-a-dee-doo-dah. -Hello. -I'm Jimmy Elpidas. -Hi. I'm Demetra and Gia's dad. Right, right, I'm Faith. Oh, nice to meet you. I think I've waved to you a couple times when I drop them off at their classes. Demetra wanted me to sign up for this. So I'm, you know... She's a wonderful girl. -Ah, thank you. -[bell chiming] Oh, guess dinner's starting. Anyway, good luck with this. -Thank you. -Oh. You came to wife's funeral, didn't you? I did, I was sorry for your loss. Thank you, it was very kind of you. I meant to write you a note, but just... It was a beautiful service, so... Anyway, good luck. Thank you. [snapping] You got it. [light music] Gia, it's daddy. I need to finish proofing my personal statement. No, no, come on, go to bed, I'll do it for you. Hi, Daddy, did you win the prize? Ah, no, I didn't, honey. I tried, but somebody else beat me out for it. No, no, that's not the way it was supposed to happen. Come on, get some sleep, okay? Good night, you guys. I love you. All right. A little tweaking won't hurt, would it? Gia, let's go, we're gonna be late for school. I don't even know why I try putting it on. I hate my makeup. Ah, good morning, Gia. All right, guys, come on. Quick prayer before we go. [phone ringing] Hold on. Yeah. Really? Oh, okay. Yeah, yeah, I know, thanks, thanks. Who was that? The guy who won the dance contest. His wife told him that she didn't want him being in it, so he had to give it back. So who won it then? They're gonna have a dance-off tomorrow between me and the other guy, that were the two top bidders. I can't believe I'm a senior, and you're still dropping me off. Ooh, there's Gia's boyfriend. -Don't. -Oh, really? -Goodbye, Dad. -Oh, my gosh. Hello, George. -Hello, George. -Stop! Bye. Anybody say I love you to Dad? No, no, they forget that I guess, okay. -[indistinct chattering] -[bell ringing] [woman] Bye, sweetie. [Jimmy] Every morning at drop-off, I watch a beautiful ballet, where the ballerinas are the mothers. With tenderness, love and grace, they move across the parking lot. As they remember lunches, tuck away homework and dispense love. Yes, father's do their part, but it's the mothers who are the stars. They know the steps. They hear the music. They don't miss a beat. I miss my ballerina. [pounding on door] It's me. I can see you. You don't need to pound like that. I'm sorry, you ready? -For what? -For the presentation? What? That's Thursday, isn't it? Oh, my gosh, Jimmy, are you kidding? Oh, no, I'll get it changed. I've done it before, no worries, no worries. Okay, okay, I got it, I got it. Okay, come on, let's go. All right then, anybody else? -Yeah. -Jimmy? Can we move the Crown Guitar presentation to next week? The date's already been moved, thank you. Oh, cool. So unless there's anything else, anybody? No? All right, thank you. -All right. -Thank you. Uh, Jimmy. You wanna hang back for a minute? Yeah. -What's up? -All right, listen. Look, I've taken a look at your numbers, and the... well, the truth is, you haven't made your numbers for the last couple of years. Your quota's way down, and you're even messing up the bloopers that I've been giving you. I am super appreciative of everything that you've done around here. But? But I have to let you go. -[somber music] -What? You need to let me go? I've been here 22 years, Brian, you're gonna let me go? Security will walk you to your desk. And you're gonna make me do a perp walk on top of it? -It's protocol. -Are you kidding me? Really, Brian, really? [sighs] [kids giggling] [man] Good afternoon, how can I direct your call? -Brian, Brian. -Ah, come on, Jimmy. Come on, what are you doing here? Give me one more chance. I don't have anymore chances. Look, I know I haven't been on top of my game lately. Whoa, whoa, whoa, on top of your game? You haven't been in the game for years. Look, man, we all feel bad about what happened to Debbie, but that was three years ago. Three years, Jim. Give me one account. -I can't. -Anything. Jimmy, come on. I got two girls, okay? Give me your worst account. The worst account, if I don't make the sale, you get rid of me, no questions asked. -You're not gonna like it. -Try me. -Soul 2Soul. -Ugh, I hate it. Of course you do. It's a dating website, me? After our last presentation, they canceled on us. It's all I got. You get them to come back in here, commit to a campaign, and we can talk about your future around here. That's it. -Brian. -It's a take it -or leave it, Jim. -Okay. [phone ringing] -Demetra, what's up? -Daddy, where are you? I'm at work, what's going on? Did you forget the dance-off? Oh, no, no, okay. I'll be right there, sweetie, I'll be right there. Hurry, the other guy is starting, and he looks really prepared. All right, show 'em the magic, son. -Jimmy? -Yeah. I'm Coretta, go on it. [Jimmy] Okay, thanks. [door squeaking] Really? Really? Come on, man, come on. The show already began. I lost my concentration. I'm gonna take it from the top. [Faith] Okay. You know, I've seen Baryshnikov stop a ballet dead in its tracks because somebody in the audience sneezed. Don't be the sneeze. Papa, cue music. ♪ You don't know ♪ Come on, come on. ♪ Whoa, whoa ♪ ♪ What I need ♪ ♪ What I need ♪ Get it up. Whoa, yeah. [woman singing] [applause] No, not yet! Oh, yes! Oh, they don't make 'em like that anymore. -Good luck topping that. -Ooh, yeah. Wow, that's a tough act to follow. Um, I didn't bring any music. Amateur. For the competition, the partners cannot have had any prior dance experience, okay? I have no prior dance experience. Although, in college, they did call me Funkenstein. Frankenstein, you mean? No, no, no, Funkenstein. but everyone thought that I was Jewish, Everyone, I'm Greek, and so they called me Stein. And then I took second place in my fraternity dance contest. So they started calling me "funk" and "stein," Funkenstein. That's a great story, can you tell it again longer? Okay, listen, I just need to see how you move. Okay, let 'er rip. -[upbeat music] -[chuckling] Hey, Baryshnikov. [Faith] How about the twist? The twist. [Faith] Good, anything else? Anybody remember the Charleston? My dead grandmother. Grandma's dead? -You stay focused. -Yeah. Who remembers this bad boy? Oh. Have you got any kicks? I got kicks all day long. Are you kidding me? Ho, hey, ho. I'm like a regular Rockette. -Sorry. -That was on purpose. It was intentional. -Back here, stay focused. -It was premeditated. Okay, are you okay? Crud, crud, yeah, just a little cramp. Okay, um, all right. Listen up, guys, this is my decision. Will you accept this rose? -Thank you. -That's very nice of you. Thank you. Thank you, thank you, thank you. They're gonna become great dance partners and fall in love. Thank you. Dad, can I have a sleepover at the Henderlinds tomorrow? Oh, honey, you know the rules. No sleepovers. Everyone does sleepovers. You're the strictest parent. [sighing] Aw, man. How am I doing? [chuckling] [sighing] Man. You made it all look so easy. I'm in trouble at work. I don't feel it anymore. [sighs] I miss you. [light dramatic music] No, no, no, no, no, no. You're not gonna do that, you're not gonna do that. Hey, morning, Jimmy. Are you hurt? Oh, no, I think I just pulled something. Doing what? Uh, squats. Squats, oh, not a fan. Yeah, I probably went a little too heavy. Hey, you start working on that Soul 2Soul ASAP, -you got it? -Yeah, yeah. I'm totally focused on it. [humming] Hey, Coretta. Oh, hey, Jimmy. And she's finishing up her last class. Oh, okay. You know, if you ever get here before she does, there's a key under the mat in the front. All right, thank you. Who's that? Ben, her ex. Great dancer, lousy husband. You know, when they got divorced, the only thing she asked for was this studio. The most important thing that I will ever, ever teach you is to let the pure joy, the happiness, the heartache, the sorrow, whatever you are feeling for that day, pour out of your souls when you dance. Because that is why we dance, okay? Now, did everybody bring their sunglasses today. [all] Yeah! Get those shades ready, ladies.

Seriously? -Yeah. -Okay. Do you wanna know what it means? No, no, no, I'll figure it out. -I'll figure it out. -[Jimmy] All right. Okay, so this is how the competition works. All right. Each couple submits their best dance. Off-tape the judges narrow it down to ten couples, and they'll dance the finals live. -Okay. -Okay? Typically the man leads, but given you're the schmo in the partnership, I'll be doing the leading. All right. Is that hard for you to do? No, not at all. I always lead every one of my partners. Okay. -So do you feel this? -Yeah. That's how I'm gonna be leading you. -Okay. -It's that push and pull. -Okay. Now, let's start with some basic moves, okay? -Very, very basic. -All right. This is called a pique turn. Pique turn. -Okay, I can give that a shot. -Okay? I'll give it a shot. -I'll give it a shot. -Have a go. No pressure. [chuckling] Posture, elbow. Posture, elbow, okay. How was that? Good, you know. -Honestly? -Horrible. -Oh, gee, that looks ominous. -Okay, this is going to help with your posture. All right. Um, up and over, okay. I feel like a scarecrow. Well, we'll need to get you into some tight clothing too, okay? You know, I'm kinda a sweatshirts and jeans kinda guy. Well, the judges like to see clean lines, so... All right. How do you feel about taking some ballet classes? Yeah, I'm gonna be totally honest with you. I'm not gonna take ballet classes. I'm probably never gonna wear this thing, you know? Anything else? Uh, no spray tans and none of those, you know, butt shakin' moves that you guys do. Hey, I won many a contest with those butt shaking moves. So what's your favorite dance? I love them all, you know, when I can do it. Really, oh, that's impressive. Okay, whatever dance we do, you have to sell it. The judges love the push and the pull of the dance. -Uh-huh. -Okay? So that means that we get close, we go apart, we get close again. Oh. That is close. That's the whole point of it. Dancers get close, but we never kiss. The judges love it. We're gonna get higher scores. You just gotta really sell it, okay? Just give a little bang, pow, what! You know what I mean? Bang, pow, what. Yeah, okay, hold on, hold on. You know, I think, with all this stuff, it's just kinda like a little information overload. Okay, all right. -Maybe. -Well, let's take -a dinner break. -Yeah, let's do that. -And I'll go over everything with you. -Okay. Okay, so I think the IC on your shirt is roman numerals for 101. Am I right? You're not even close. -You're not even close. -Come on. Okay, I'll figure it out. But first thing's first. -Okay. -We need to come up with a great team name. Okay. Next, we need to practice as much as possible. So, what's your schedule like? Uh, well, every Friday I have Bible study, and then Gia has prom next month, so that'll be kinda busy. Oh, that'll be so much fun. I never went to my prom. Really, why not? I had issues and kinda wasn't meant to be. But actually, they just announced the high school reunion is gonna be next month. Oh, cool. But I'm probably not gonna go though. Why not? Bad memories. There was this girl Susie, and she made my life hell in high school. She was on the dance squad. I got cut from the dance squad, so she just always thought she was a better dancer than me. Hmm. Anyway, what's your work schedule like? Uh, well, I just got this huge new client presentation I gotta work on. Oh, what's it for? It's a dating website called Soul 2Soul. Oh, I've never heard of that one, and I'm on every single site. You're on every dating website? Mm-hmm. I got divorced a year ago. So I thought I should get back out there. Oh, good for you. Any... any luck? Well, I get asked out on a lot of first dates but not a lot of second dates. I am just horrible at dating. And I'm super shy. But you know the problem with dating websites? What's that? They never really let you get to know the person. It's all about checking a ton of boxes, and what they should have are videos of the people, you know, answering questions about themselves. Hm, thank you. Not a bad idea. Do you mind if I say a quick prayer? Oh, no, go ahead. Heavenly Father, we thank you for this food, and Lord, I thank you for this fellowship with Faith, and in particular, Father, I ask that whatever's on Faith's heart that you grant it. In your son's name I pray, amen. Did I just totally mess that up? What? Was I meant to hold your hands during the prayer? Oh, no, no, no. See, some of my friends, when we pray, they hold hands. Some don't. I never know which it's gonna be, so I put my hands out there, duck the head, I don't know what's gonna happen. -I just... I just say the prayer. -Okay. Phew, okay, great. Yeah. No, no, you're fine, you're fine, enjoy your food. Thank you. Hey, hey, I came up with your team name. Okay. The Premonitions. The Premonitions? Like when you see the future? Yeah. Like when I was 19, I was gettin' my hair done, and the stylist told me that she had a premonition that one day a man would walk in the room and the moment I saw him, that I would pass out. And bam, it would be my husband. And? It never happened. Well, wait, wait, wait, I guess that was a bad example. But it would have been a premonition. The Premonitions. I'm gonna think about that one, Coretta. [chuckling] Hey, when you go to church and they say the word "fellowship," what exactly does that mean? Well, it just means spending time together and forming friendships. -It doesn't mean, like, dating or anything, right? -Oh, no, no, no. I just don't wanna give Jimmy any mixed signals, you know? I don't need another dance romance. I know that's right. Well, well, why? What did Jimmy say? Well, he was praying before we ate, and he said something about fellowship and God helping me with whatever's on my heart. You know that voice inside you? Some people call it conscience. We call it God. And God puts something on your heart, and you know it's the right thing to do. But you may be afraid to do it. That's when something's on your heart. Okay, well, I just wanted to make sure. Well, now remember, you only have one month left to get your submission dance in. Okay, okay, I'm gonna get on that. All right.

Everyone must be trying to upload at the deadline. Oh, don't worry about it. I've got it. I'm gonna be here. I'll make sure that it goes through. No, it's okay, I'm gonna stick around tonight.
