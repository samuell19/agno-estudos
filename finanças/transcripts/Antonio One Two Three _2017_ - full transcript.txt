Next stop: Santos. Sorry! I'm so sorry, I left my phone here. Hi dad. Yes, I'm outside. Sorry, Nuno's car broke down. We had to sleep at his girlfriend's house. Yes, in Odivelas. OK. We'll talk when I get home. OK. Bye. I hate to wake up to yelling. Dad! Watch out for the floor. It's wet. Hi. Mind if I smoke? Yes, I do. So? So. This morning I went out to buy some bread. I walked past your room. The door was ajar, I went in, you weren't there. I was worried at first because you didn't say anything last night... I don't know if you understood me, Nuno's car... But immediately afterwards I was happy because I thought: "How silly of me." My son is already a grown man. My son is old enough to make his own choices. He is exactly the same age I was when I had him. Amazing, isn't it? For instance, he says, "Tonight, I'm not sleeping at home." "Tonight I'm not sleeping at home, and my father won’t be worried, because I'm an adult." I thought about all that, António. While I was walking down the stairs. While opening the door. While crossing the street. While buying bread. Four loaves thinking of you. While walking back home. While opening the mailbox. Where I found this letter. A letter... - A letter. No sender, addressed to me. Can you read it? I don't have my glasses on. Sure. Mr. João... "Mr. João... I hereby warn you of a fact that has been taking place for around a year now. To be more precise, since the last academic year of the Faculty... of Science and Technology of the New University of Lisbon. I believe it's in your best interest to know the use, or rather, lack of it that your son makes of your money. I assure you that I have nothing to gain from the fact that I am about to disclose: Your son António no longer attends the Electrical... and Computer Engineering course. Can you repeat that? Repeat that sentence, please. Your son António no longer attends the Electrical... and Computer Engineering course. And, may I add, he knows nothing about electrons or transistors. I don't know what the boy does in his free time. And I honestly hope it's nothing gruesome. I truly hope you can clear things up. And I wish you a good year. Signed, a friend." Is this true? I have no idea who might have written this. Neither have I. Who knew that your dad was paying the university fees and you were not attending? Almost no one. Nuno, plus two or three trustworthy people, and you. So, you're saying that I wrote that? No, Mariana, that's not it. Listen António, why would I talk about your life to your dad? He saw me twice. He probably doesn't even remember me. I was really mad at you, I wanted to rip your head off I even changed the bloody door lock. But I did not write that. Mariana, I've already apologised for what I've done... Good evening! I've already apologised for what I've done and for what I haven't done. António, if you know that I'm not the one who wrote that, what are you doing standing at my door? I have no place to go, Mariana. Man, don't you have friends? What about Nuno? Go to Nuno's house. Nuno lives with his parents. I could stay here in the guest room. No, you can't. I'm renting the room. There's a Brazilian girl here. I could stay in your room. No. I have nowhere to sleep. We could sleep with our clothes on, we wouldn't touch each other. Mariana! Mariana, come in! Please. Wine? Pour? Spill? Balance? Now, whose turn is it? Yours? Ours? I think it's my turn. Yours passed. This is António, you all know each other. This is... Débora. I'm going out for a smoke. So whose turn was it anyway? Was it mine? It was Alice's. So Débora, you can play with António. Give them the dice. Mimics. Sword. Warrior. Star Wars! Passing away! Being an idiot! Pseudo intellectual! - Strong! Chronic stupidity! Lumberjack! Sailor! - Being super-thin! Lumberjack! - Disappear! Little Red Riding Hood! Oh, I know! Pussy! Dead! Fuck Mariana's apartment up! Bodybuilder! It was “Defeating”. That's what you are. Good mime. Now it's my turn, right? Here's the key, if you need to go out, to buy something to eat. Are you going out? I'm going to work. When are you coming back? When I finish my work. I could clean or cook something... Leave it António. Just leave the key under the rug or with the Brazilian girl when she wakes up. And try to keep it quiet, I think she's still asleep. Bye. Bye. I'm sorry! I'm so sorry! No, it's fine! Just leave it! Leave it, I'll fix that later. All the door handles are busted. The only one working is the one on the front door. I think there were some burglaries and Mariana decided to change the lock. Do you live here? Yes. No. I spend most of my time here. António. I remember from last night. Débora. I too remember. Are you going to stay here for a long time? Hum, twelve hours. So soon... Are you going straight back to Brazil, then? No, I'm going to Russia. I don't speak Russian. Me neither. I just know how to ask if you have lume and 'where is the toilet?' But I know where that is. "Lume"? Lighter? No, I don't have a lighter. I do, I was just trying to practice my Russian. I don't know if that was correct, but I'll take a cigarette. Yeah, sure. The difference between hot and cold water is practically none. If you want, I can leave the tap on the right position, then all you have to do is pull it up. If you want hot water you have to turn the boiler on. It's a bit old. You have to press the left button and then switch it on. You have to be careful, if you don't push the left button the gas will run out. And with this weather it's impossible to shower with cold water. Once we ran out of gas and the downstairs neighbour... would let us shower at her place in exchange for mortalhas. What do you mean "mortalhas"? The paper to roll up the cigarettes. Seda. Yes, papers. Look, if you want to cook, here you have pans, pots, olive oil, vinegar, salt... Fuck! Mariana didn't buy any salt. António, I'm only here for the day. Mariana's little treasures are here, and you can't use them. There's granola, oat... some grains that I don't even know what they are. I think she's on a diet. I never saw her eating these things. Where did you meet her? We met in school, but we only started dating long after that. She remembered me, but I didn't remember her. She told me she had a videotape of us at a concert. Not a concert, a talent show in school. Where I played the flute and she was belly dancing. I remember playing the flute, but I didn't remember any belly dancers. I think this tape is still here, I can show you. António! Hi, Teresa! Everything okay? You have been missing. Yeah, I was in Russia. In Moscow. In Moscow! Yeah, I was studying photography. Photography? Yeah. So, did you miss that stuff that I used to bring you? Sometimes I would ask Mariana. But, she wouldn't roll it up for you!? I managed. So, you and Mariana are still... Yeah, yeah, we've been together all this time. So, what about the blond guy? That must be her cousin, Filipe. No, I know Filipe. The other one, I think he was German. She's renting one of the rooms, it must have been a guest. Ok. Hey, do you happen to have a VCR that we can borrow? Did you get a VCR? Yeah, Teresa had one. However there's a videotape stuck inside, but she said that if we fix it we can keep it. I think it won’t be difficult. It's working. Let's watch the tape that is stuck inside? Yes, I think we can watch it. Is it OK here? Hello sweetheart! I am at a party, and our song is playing. But nobody is dancing, so I decided to make a video to send the song to you, OK? You are always saying that I don't know how to sing so... I am going to sing. You are recording, right? - Yes. Have you ever been to Lisbon before? No, never. It's still early, if you want I can show you around the city. That’s alright, I'm not going to leave the house. My flight is at dawn. I know that with this crazy weather it gets a little complicated but the city is really beautiful. I could tell. What have you seen? Actually, I fell asleep in the train and when I woke up I was in a place... that I guess was a bit far away. There were some old buildings not a lot of people on the street. There was an old lady, she was asking for money like this. I was scared. Like this? Like this! Like the Lenin statue? To the future! To the future! You could have gone anywhere, and you ended up at your ex-girlfriend's place. Because you hope that when she comes back she'll let you stay. Because you still love her. Have you ever woken up in the middle of the night... in anguish because you're alone? Yes. Right... Then probably after that you wrote a letter to your dad telling him... the exact thing that he cannot know about you, because if he knew, if he found out that you haven't been going to university for over a year now he would probably kick you out. No, I never did that. But, ironically, that's the perfect opportunity for you to be able... to go back to the apartment that holds the happiest memories of your life. Did you do that? Yes Débora, I'm pretty dumb. Especially when I wake up all alone and anguished in the middle of the night. Remember how this feeling starts right here, in your belly. And spreads to each cell of your body? Before I used to feel this warmth on my skin, a shortness of breath, an euphoria, but now the same thing makes my arms and legs tremble, makes my eyes water. I haven't been here in a while, but everything is exactly where it used to be. Even the clothes drawer, my drawer has clean socks in it. But only now I realize that when I'm with her, next to her or even when I'm on the couch where we've fucked hundreds of times I don't feel at home any more. I feel way better here, in the guest room with no frames on the walls or books on the shelves. You're very beautiful, António. Thank you, Débora. No, you didn't get it, I said you are very beautiful. "Last week Lenin's grave suffered another attack. I was told that there are several bullet holes in his mummified body. I find it curious, this thing of killing someone who's already dead. The temperature here is minus three. I take my scarf off for a second to send you a kiss. Débora." That's it António, you can stay here until the end of the month. Mr. Armando is on vacation, so make yourself at home. I'll talk to Sara, see if I can get you some more sheets and blankets... so you can be more comfortable. Don't drink tap water from the bathroom, it's not drinkable. And If you stay here during the morning, don't be too noisy, there's a stage upstairs and they usually rehearse early in the mornings, so please, keep it down. Apart from that, you can make yourself at home. Thank you. Wanna grab a coffee? Only if you're paying. Let me see if I have the money. I have 50 cents. Wait. 20 cents. It isn't enough, coffee here costs 75 cents. We could drink it at university campus. Fuck you. Wait. 15. Hold on. 5. That's it, we have enough to share a coffee. Shit Johnny! This isn't good. Service lights, please. And the music. Sara!? Sara isn't here. Is Sara here? No. Does he always walk around like this? Naked? What? No! I thought Brazilians were always like this at home. Look, the house is also mine. I pay half the rent Nuno. So he goes around half naked. The upper half, or the lower half? Fuck you. What did he want from Sara? I think that now it's the sound that's fucked up. This whole play is fucked up. Well done. I don't feel sorry at all. Oh you don't? You don't need to be jealous, Nuno. Fuck you, okay? I'm sick of it. António, I think you could do it differently. Where's the spotlight? This is the main one. Okay. I'll do it like this. I take off my shirt, my trousers, my underpants and then I stop. I'll wait until the sidelights lower smoothly. While the spotlight lights up directly. And then I'll stare at the static light as if it was a living being. A tree, a totem! And within the space created by the light, I get in and when I feel comfortable, I sing. Sara! Johnny! What were you doing? I was in the toilet. In the toilet? - Yes. Did you notice the error on the recording? - Was there an error on the recording? Yes, there was an error on the recording! - And now what do we do? I don't know, that's why I was looking for you. Do you want me to call the musician? Yes, now! - Now... So. This morning I went out to buy some bread. I walked past your room. The door was ajar, I went in. You weren't there. At first I was worried, because you didn't say anything last night... I don't know if you understood. My friend's car had a problem. You can carry on, Miguel. But immediately after, I was happy, because I thought: "How silly of me". My son is already a grown man. My son is old enough to make his own choices. He is exactly the same age I was when I had him. Amazing, isn't it? For instance, he says: Tonight I'm not sleeping home and my father won't be worried because I'm an adult! Because I'm an adult! May I? Thank you. I thought about all that. I thought about all that while I was walking down the stairs. While crossing the street. While buying bread. Four loaves thinking of you. While walking back home. While opening the mailbox. Where I found this letter. A letter? A letter. No sender addressed to me. Can you read it? And then the letter is read. What does the letter say? Something that makes the father kick him out of the house. What do you mean? It doesn't matter. What if the letter says he hasn't been to university for quite a while? No. What if the letter says he's a criminal? Yes! A drug addict or a thief. It's enough that he lies. But what does he lie about? He lies with no evil intent. It doesn't matter. The letter is read. He gets up and runs away. And goes to his ex's home. Where he fixes a VCR that makes them both reconnect. So he's afraid of his father? Yes, he is. And runs away to the street? It can be, but it mustn't be a scared run. It's an unexpected escape, even funny. So he runs through the streets laughing. Runs away laughing. Yes, he looks at his father and smiles. I think it's good that he smiles. Why? Johnny, excuse me. In this scene, the father could have a knife to peel the orange. And then it would make sense for him to be afraid. I'll think about that, António. Can you write that down, Sara? Sara isn't here. And he smiles because it worked. So he needs to be kicked out of the house to have a reason to stay at his girlfriend's? His ex's, I mean. Is that it? So it was him who wrote the letter. Maybe, maybe yes. He's afraid because he doesn't know if his father will have a violent reaction. And in the end he laughs because it worked and his father believed the letter. Look, does he go to university or not? He attended long enough to learn how to fix the VCR later. Johnny. The director of the theater wants to talk to you. Now? Now. António. Hi, Mariana. What are you doing at my door? Mariana, I had some tests done that came out positive... I think you should do them, too. Do you think I would come here to say that? I'm kidding. Are you crazy? It was just a little joke. I need you to return some socks I left there. Socks? There must be a lot of socks that are mine. Some with stripes, with circles... Good afternoon. - Hi, good afternoon. Yes, I remember. Okay, get in but be quiet. There's a Brazilian girl sleeping here. Sure. Is she your friend? No. I'm renting the guest room. I noticed you got some new stuff for the flat. Yes, I changed the living room a bit. And I also remodelled the kitchen. Are you making decent money with the guest room? Yes, I'm renting it... I have people here almost every week. Good! And the water boiler? Does it still give you trouble? Not any more. I replaced it. I was sick of it. Isn't it a bit late for her to be sleeping? Jet lag. Where's she coming from? She's going to Russia, or coming from Russia… There you go. There were a lot more socks here, Mariana. I can only find these now. If I find more, I'll give them to you. Now hurry. What's up? What? I lost my keys. Now he said that a copy of the keys would cost €200. I asked him why and he said it's an anti-robbery system. I said I'd rather have my house robbed than pay €200 for a key. And I also said that technically what he was doing was robbery. He hung up. He hung up on me. What's that noise? It's the wind on the bottlenecks. Look... What's happening, Johnny? Couldn't you have gone to a less public space? He was a married man António, and I couldn't take him home either. The park is huge. The key could be anywhere. The key can only be near these trees. Yesterday I went to Mariana's. And? Nothing. It's been a while since you last saw each other, no? Yeah, we hadn't seen each other for ages. Now she rents her place to tourists. There was Brazilian girl sleeping there. She was thinner, had something done to her hair. And then I started thinking about the play. The character goes to his ex's place... because he stills loves her. Yes. And her, does she still love him? It doesn't matter. What do you mean? In the flat they reunite, they remember what they've been through. The memory of things, you know? The couch, the door handles. All that awakens what they felt before. The door handles… Yes, the door handles. Yesterday the only thing I could notice... In my mind her flat was way bigger. I even thought there were more socks in my drawer. Even Mariana was bigger in my mind. Maybe that's why I thought she lost weight. Look! One euro! [Spanish] Strolling many years ago Down a street taken over by acacias in bloom I found out from a friend who knows everything That you had just gotten married. I told him that I really had nothing to do with it. Good morning, Tiago! Good morning guys! Sorry for being late. Can you put your socks on the centre of the stage? Socks? Were we supposed to bring socks today? You can use the ones you’re wearing. Quickly! [Spanish] I never loved you — You know that better than I do — Yet each time the acacias bloom — Can you believe it? — I get the very same feeling I had When they hit me point-blank With the heartbreaking news That you had married someone else. Your feet are freezing. It's Nicanor Parra. There are a lot of socks around us. What size are you? My father used to recite this poem every night, at dinner. You know it's not good to have your feet so cold. You might catch a cold. Now every time I walk by a garden I remember this poem that reminds me of my father. Come on, give me your feet! I'm not liking this at all. 15 days to the premiere and I'm not liking this at all. Sorry, I skipped a part of the text. António, I want sidelights very low, almost dark. As it was before? What do you mean, as it was before? As it was before you wanted to change everything, Johnny. António, do as I say. Don't you wanna try a bit as it is and then you decide... if you want to change everything again, Johnny. Do you think I don't know what I want? I know what I want! Johnny. Honestly, it's not the first time this happens. One day you ask one thing, then another. Then everything goes back, then you do it all differently. We're confused. This is my working method and you accepted to take part in it. Johnny, 15 days to the premiere. As it is, it will be a fiasco. This show won't be a fiasco. If we go on like this, it will. I didn't come to this country to premiere a failure. Can we go now, Johnny? The first time I came to this country I stayed on this side of the river. I didn't like it at all. I even argued with the guest coordinator of the festival. But they said the prices here were lower and that a car would pick me up everyday. But as I sleep a lot and the car came too early, I had to learn how to catch the ferry to the other side. And that's how I met Martim. Waiting for the ferry to come. Looking at this line of lights from Lisbon. Pay attention to this line. Everything was so strange and crazy, António. But I immediately understood that the two of us We were living in different sides. When I went back to Brazil. The river turned into an ocean. Then it was all a monstrosity fed by the poorest and fakest of circumstances. You could have gone anywhere and ended here in... your ex-boyfriend's country? Because you were hoping to be with him. Because you still loved him. I believe I can make a good show here. I really do. And I think I can show him that I'm fine. Learn how to lose, Johnny. Tomorrow, wake up early as I have to, and learn how to lose. The ferry! We'll have to wait for the first ferry in the day. What about my job, Johnny? I told you I had to go to work. I only have a few cents and no money for a taxi. But did you spend it all? Johnny, I stayed with you all this time. I never left you alone. But I need to go home. Then go. Go! Go! Go swimming. Cross the river swimming! Fucking Brazilian! Do you think you're the only one who feels pain? Shut the fuck up, you fucking Portuguese! And put your clothes on! I hate you, Johnny dos Santos! Because you're arrogant and an artist. Because you're unbearably Brazilian. And I'm the guy that needs to ask you to pay me for a Vodka shot. Even though the Real is five times cheaper than the Euro. You change countries like you change clothes. And I'm the guy who learned something about wires, electricity and who you treat badly. But who has an ex-girlfriend like you have an ex-boyfriend. Learn how to lose! I can only see this sight at night because I need to work... at a Summer Club's pool to get some tips. And you criticise me for not cleaning the floor well enough, for not setting the spotlight as I should. As if I was some stupid shit, some asshole! Repeat what you said! Repeat it! I hate you, Johnny dos Santos! Because you're an artist, and arrogant! Because you're unbearably Brazilian. And I need to ask you to pay me for a Vodka shot! Even though the Real is five times cheaper than the Euro. You change countries like you change your clothes. And I'm the guy who learned something about wires, electricity... and who you treat badly! But I have an ex-girlfriend like you have an ex-boyfriend. Learn how to lose! I can only see this sight at night because I need to work... at a Summer Club's pool to get some tips. And you criticise me for not cleaning the floor well enough, for not setting the spotlight properly. As if I was some stupid, some fool. Some asshole. Are you stupid? Revida! Revida! What's "revida", for fuck's sake? Hit me back! Look! There's still one ferry. Good morning. - Good morning. Thank you for being here. I'm sorry about the last rehearsal. I think at some point I lost control. We still have some days until the premiere, but I believe we already have a good show. Do you have any suggestions? This time I'll be out. I won't act any longer. That's quite a big change. If this show turns out to be a failure, let it be because we put everything on it. I did some adjustments on the script and I have a change to make. Susana, you'll repeat three sentences. And António, you'll react as you think is best. You could have gone anywhere and you came here. To your ex-girlfriend's house. Because you're hoping she'll let you stay here. Because you still love her. She’s not answering. I think I'm going to a hotel. Thanks. No, stay here. She’ll be here any minute. Sit, sit. Make yourself at home. Do you want a glass of water? Yes. Do you smoke? No, I’m quitting. What about ganzas? "Ganzas"? Yes, ganzas… How do you say it in Brazil? "Ervas"! Maconha (joints). Yes, maconha I do smoke. There you go. Sorry, I have to open the door. Help yourself. António! What’s up, Teresa? All good? You’ve been missing. Yes, sorry, it's the rehearsals… So you and Mariana still…? No, no, that’s history. Come on, get in. I just lit one up. I can't, I have to run to the theatre, today is the last presentation. And just as I promised, there’s your ticket. And there’s an extra one for Mariana. She wasn't upstairs, can you give it to her if you see her? Sure, of course. And thanks! But not even a glass of water? We really have to leave it for some other time. Kisses, then. But be there early, I want to see you in the first row. Okay, deal! Break a leg! Sorry. Do you live here by yourself? I was married for six years with my first boyfriend. The one in the photo? No, the one in the photo is my dad. Sérgio was way different. Sérgio was big, handsome... and clumsy. So clumsy that one day at work he fell from a place and died. I'm sorry. There’s nothing for you to feel sorry about, Débora. I’ve already felt everything there was to feel. With the insurance money I bought this apartment. It’s a nice apartment. Comfortable and always with hot water. I bought this apartment, the VCR and got the turntable fixed. And got the turntable fixed. I was always trying to do something, all the time, to see if I could fill the emptiness he left me with. His fall made a hole in me. Until one day I learned how to deal with that hole. With the guy that came by a while ago, for instance. All of a sudden I stopped hearing the noises of the bed squeaking, right above us. And started hearing him yelling through my window. He yelled, he yelled his girlfriend’s name. Mariana! Mariana! Mariana! A horror... He would come here so that I would read him the tarot only to bump into her in the hallway. And the tarot would always say the same. And the same wasn’t good. There’s a time when you learn how to deal with the hole With tarot, you write, you put on a play, you do sit-ups And everything goes away. Good evening, I’d like to exchange two invitations for two tickets for "White Nights". You can go in, it’s starting. Enjoy the show! Thank you! Nuno, you can close the ticket office. Come here! No, not now! There was once a sky full of stars. So bright that the foreigner who would look up to it Would be forced to ask himself "Can it be possible that beneath this sky angry and capricious men live?" A wonderful night. One of those nights that are only possible when we are young. In other words, one of those nights that are only possible when we don’t have a penny. We turned the sofa and bed upside down. The kitchen drawers and paper bags. The pockets... António, your friend is here. We closed the ticket office. Thanks, Sara. Break a leg. ...and a bottle of beer can be slipped between two glasses. Never has the word starlight... been so close to the word austerity. "Oh, love me, do not forsake me, because I love you so at this moment, because I am worthy of your love, because I will deserve it, my dear. Next week I am to be married to him. But I want to come and see you with him. Forgive me, remember and love your, Nastenka." Our Dreamer read the letter many times and tears were about to pour down his eyes. All of a sudden, everything around him grew older. Or that beam of sunlight that lighted everything up, was suddenly covered by a cloud. But our Dreamer thinks. And this is how our Dreamer thinks. Had he the right to, with his pain, darken his friend’s joy? Yes? No. May your sky be clear, he thinks. May your sweet smile be bright and untroubled, he thinks. May you be blessed for that moment of blissful happiness which you gave to another heart. Mine, his. Lonely and grateful. My God, a whole moment of happiness! Is that too little for the whole of a man’s life? Tell me, that chlamydia joke on the play was directed to you? Really, Alice? Can’t you see the play was written by Dostoyevsky? Okay but it’s an adaptation. But with that person you never know. But did you like the play or not? I thought it was good. It’s not that I didn’t like. I just didn't relate to some things. Like what? See you in a bit. Mariana? - Yes? Don’t you recognize me? No, sorry. I’m Débora, the Brazilian girl who rented a room at your house. Oh no… But weren’t you only arriving next week? No. Sorry, I'm so sorry really… But how did you get here? Teresa, your neighbour, found me and brought me here. Sorry, really. - No, it’s okay. Are you going home? No, not yet. I’m going to a friend’s party, that’s performing at a bar. Want to come? I’m a bit tired. - Come on, it will be fun. Congratulations! I liked it a lot. What’s up, Mariana? Already met your guest? I did, thanks! Did you enjoy the play? A lot. - I liked it a lot Did António invite you to the party now? I'm not going. Débora will represent me there. Don’t leave Lisbon with just a widow's house to remember, girl. Actually, I slept the whole play. Really? - Yes, I was very tired. It's jet lag. - It's normal, you have to sleep. It was OK, it wasn’t amazing. António! - What’s up, Mariana? Congratulations! - Thanks. Look, I really liked the play. You were great. The other girl who was with you, what's her name? Susana. Susana wasn't as good as you, but she was close. Débora. António. You’re the director of the play, Teresa's friend. And you’re the girl who slept the whole play. Sorry. I’m now renting the guest room and Débora is staying there before she goes to Russia. Actually I came from Russia, I was there for 5 years. And now I’m going back to Brazil. Say something in Russian. Oh it’s Filipe, see you in a bit! So, is the script yours? I found it beautiful. It starts like "White Nights" but about not having money So you were still awake in the beginning of the play. Sorry, I didn’t get any rest. I arrived this morning. The script is a mash-up. It’s quite arrogant and makes more sense in English. When Susana, the other actress, says “austeridade” and "estelar”. It’s more as if she was saying austerity and starlight. Makes sense. It’s halfway through. What have I lost? He’s now measuring the distance between walls with his arms. Before that he used his hands, his thumb. And now, when he finishes, he writes down the number in that paper. Where? On the wall. Even though Johnny likes numbers as much as me, he has never studied maths. I think he learned how to be methodical with his parents. What do his parents do? They have some church in Fortaleza. Are you very close? - At first we weren't. I found everything he did quite weird. But then we started talking when we both weren’t so good. We talked all the time about your country and mine. About job interviews, about exorcisms… After all they’re not that different. Then I saw this play and he told me that doing this was like riding a mechanical bull. But the mechanical bull was him. That’s when we became friends. Sorry, I’m making you lose your attention. No, it’s good to hear you talking. Pay attention! This is my favorite part. He put the pen on the floor. I like this because you don’t expect him to take things out of his pockets. Are those coins? - Yes, and a paper clip, his mobile phone, the visa and even his clothes. And now in the space between the line and the wall. He places his body. And what have you done all this time in Russia? A photography course. How’s the course there? Really good. In the old times, they’d teach you how to shoot. You know how to shoot? No. That was in the old times. I’ve got hiccups. Stop! Breathe slowly. Put the glass here. Drink, drink a lot. Have you seen Mariana? I think it worked. And I think your friend Mariana left you alone in the party. Do you have her address? I do. But there's no guarantees that she went home. I can stay at Teresa’s. She’s really nice. I think she likes you a lot. I like her a lot, too. She told you about me? Did you know that the word “suddenly” appears more than 600 times in "Crime and Punishment"? Excuse me. I love this song and I’m trying to record a video for my girlfriend. If you don’t mind just press here and it starts recording? Okay? Thanks! Is it ok here? Hello sweetheart! I'm at a party and our song is playing. But nobody is dancing, so I decided to make a video to send you the song, OK? You are always saying that I don't know how to sing so... I am going to sing. You are recording, right? - Yes. It’s really good. Hey, your girlfriend went that way. António! Is Débora there? So you met each other… Have you lost the girl already? She must be at Mariana’s... No, she’s not. Her things are still here, and I didn’t hear any noise from upstairs since I got home. Do you want me to tell her anything? No, thanks Teresa. António! António! I really liked that part of the play where you said you walked and walked and then got to a place. I found it so beautiful. "I walked a lot and for a long time... Because of so much walking I forgot where I was." It’s not that part, it’s the part with the dogs! "In the trail of the dogs, my soul found my heart Broken but alive Dirty, badly dressed and full of love There where no one wants to go There where only poets go when they have nothing to do." Did you enjoy performing tonight? There were a lot of handsome guys in the audience and I love to get naked among them. That’s all you have to say? At least this time you didn’t end up at a police station. No, I liked it a lot and I was telling Débora about it and she loved it. That way I’ll be jealous, Johnny. My heart is all yours, António. Not. Tiago is waiting for me. And you? When will you go back to Brazil? Tomorrow. Ridiculous. I won’t say goodbye because I know we’ll see each other again. And to you my friend, goodbye! Goodbye. Johnny is really nice. He’s really great. Sorry for leaving you alone at the party with those hiccups. All right! Johnny brought me here, pressed my ribs, gave me food and it worked. Did you notice that you left without knowing where Teresa lives? True. If I hadn’t found you, you’d have to find shelter at some square, eating pigeons. Is Teresa’s house nearby? Yes, we can walk. Débora, I go this way. Teresa’s house is... that way. Well, thanks for the tickets... and for the company... You’re welcome. Be back soon. Yes. One day is very little in this city. It’s very little. Bye. Débora! Teresa’s house is near but mine is nearer and you’ll wake up Teresa at this hour, and Lisbon’s a mess and you might get lost and the hills, so many hills… Why don’t you sleep at my place and tomorrow you wake up early, Or later and you have lunch. I don’t know, that's all I wanted to say Okay. Here’s a towel. Thanks, António. If you need anything you can wake me up. I’ll be in the living room. Why don't you sleep here? There’s room for the two of us. I sleep on this side and you sleep on the other. Okay. The couch is really small… We had a big couch with three seats but it caught fire. Well, it didn’t catch fire. Once, I was playing PlayStation with a friend and we burned it with a cigarette Then we took it to be fixed, and no one ever picked it up. Débora, are you sleeping? Hello. Don’t be scared. Get in, have a seat. Sorry, I didn’t expect to find anyone here. Are you António's friend? No, I’m António’s father. My name is João. João António Mateus. But to be easier you can either call me João or Mateus. Or António. António like your son? No, António like his grandfather. And where is he? He is dead. No, oh no. António. He went out to buy bread. We’re not used to having guests at this hour. But he should be here soon. And you? What’s your name? Four loaves thinking of you. You shaved your beard? Yes, the beard was for the character. And did you like his character? Yes, a lot. Débora slept through most of the play. António... - It's true. You carry on, talking, I have to go to work. Dad, watch out for the weather. Take an umbrella. And you, when do you go? My flight is in... seven hours. Okay then... A classic! Do you want me to polish it? Mr. João is the best watchmaker in Lisbon. In that case yes. It'll just take a minute. See you in a bit. Do you want an orange? - Yes. Moscow is cold but there’s heating everywhere It's easier to die from dehydration than to die from the cold. So I left all my warmer clothes there even the thicker socks, and my feet are very cold. I could tell when you rubbed your feet on me during the night. Did I also talk in my sleep? Nothing I didn’t know already. What do you plan to do when you arrive in Brazil? I’ll arrive at the airport, pick up my bags, get a taxi if my mom’s not waiting for me Sort out my old wardrobe with my old things, my room... Stay! I think I was asleep when you sang that song in the play. Where did you find it? One day I was walking in the street in Lisbon and I stumbled upon it. And do you know what it means? The singer asks the listener if he believes in life after love. And he thinks the listener is not strong enough. No. - No? Actually it’s about a puppy that runs away from home and the whole song is told by the puppy. It says he’s leaving home but he’ll be back one day. Very beautiful. It’s beautiful. What did I miss from the play? If you want I can show you, sleeping beauty. I do. Hello! What’s your name? Débora. Can you speak louder? I couldn’t hear. Débora. I couldn’t hear. Débora! You don’t need to yell, girl. People might be sleeping here. Sorry. The girl doesn’t want to know my name. What’s your name? I am... the Dreamer! I didn’t know your play was a puppet show, António. António? What António? I can’t see anyone besides the two of us. Oh maybe you’re talking about the former habitant of this house. That António doesn’t live here anymore. He went mad. He left his dad, his friends, the university and now lives under his lover’s terrace though she no longer loves him. And the bell rings and rings and rings... And no one opens the door. But I’m not talking about that António. - No? Wasn’t there another one living here? Maybe you’re talking about a shorter one with a beard? Yes, maybe that one. That António died! He threw himself into the pool of a Summer Club after 36 hours of work. How tragic… - Yes, it ain’t easy But I’m not talking about that one either. No? -No So who’s that one you’re talking about? He’s short, with dark hair. He has a spot on his nose right here. And his ears are flat as if they were glued inside out. What a monster! But that’s not all. I think I know a bit more about him than he does about me. Every time he looks at me, he has a scared face as if some fly landed on my hair. Maybe he doesn’t understand why this girl ran away from university as if her dorm room was buried in snow. How do you know that, António? He looks at you as if you were written in Russian. How do you know about the university, António? Maybe he thought a certain feeling would never be back again. And it’s like finding an old friend that walks the same way, but is unrecognizable. What’s that feeling? Who am I to know? I’m just a sock, ask him. Dreamer? If the flow is slow enough and you have a good bicycle, or a horse, it is possible to bathe twice or even three times, should your personal hygiene so require in the same river. What’s that noise? What time is it? I don’t know, I don’t have my watch. Fuck, I forgot to feed Cat. What cat? Cat is my dog. Fuck, it’s cold! What’s the password for the Wi-Fi? Happy days. In lower case. I’ll get my sock wet. No, you won't.
