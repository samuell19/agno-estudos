[carriage driver] Look, Mr. Parker, you're an hour -and forty-five minutes late, -I'm sorry-- you canceled two appointments last week, and now -your damn batteries are dead? -No, I got new batteries! First of all, I had to cancel those appointments because you canceled on me twice before. I had to reschedule. Whoa, now, boyo, I'm not getting paid for this. If I get a customer you've just got to wait. Okay, I'll wait! Look, we're here for the horse, okay? The horse is here, you're here, I'm here. Can we do this? -Proceed. -Thank you. So, you said you've experienced some kind of abuse by horse handlers, right? Yeah, if you want to put it that way. How much longer do you need me here? It's 5:30, I want to get up to Central Park-- It's 5:30? Wait, hold on one second. -What am I waiting for? -I have to make a phone call. You're making a phone call? On my time? -[phone beeps] -[Keith] Battery-- [Keith] No, no, It's your time. No, come on. Hold that. Thank you. [Keith] Uh, horses, they can't be hurt, uh... Jesus H. Christ on a crutch! Hey, Liz, it's me, Keith. Yeah, honey, I know what time it is. I'm working! I can't. I'll be there, okay, I'll be there. Just take--I'll take a cab. Yeah, yeah. What? No, I'm listening to you. Yeah, yeah. No, listen-- Oh, shit! Liz! Liz? Shit! [Keith] Okay computer. Anyone who lives in and most who have visited New York City have seen them. A romantic horse and buggy ride around Central Park. Edit. Start again. What could be more New York than a romantic horse and buggy ride? Where are your keys, man? It's 3 am. Sorry, I didn't have my keys. Yeah, well, what else is new? Phil, uh, Saturday you're going to have the rent? No doubt. Saturday. Good night, man. Good night, bro. Please don't forget. Thank you. [Keith] Good morning, Sally. It's Keith. -[Sally on phone] Keith who? -Keith Parker. [Sally] Oh, he wants to talk to you. I need these done by lunchtime, okay? And close the door on your way out. -Hello, Keith. -[Keith] Ed. So, um, good morning. What do you think? I think it's time for you to get a new job. It's over, Keith. Ed, come on. You can't be serious. I'm at my computer right now, and I know that it needs work. What do you need me to do? I can change anything you need. [Ed] Come on, Keith, get real. I know you probably wrote that last night or this morning. You haven't written anything worth publishing in almost two years. I've let you coast on your past too long. I can't do it anymore. [sighs] So I got fired, bro. What? Don't tell me. Don't go there. I fucked up, man. It was my fault. And between Gina and Liz, trying to juggle those two, and... yeah, I started missing writing assignments Damn, Keith! All that money? On staff, working out of your apartment, making your own hours. Mick! Do you have to rub it in? Yeah. Because what are you gonna do now? Write a book, like you're always talking about? Man, I wish I could, but... He said that if I come up with something good that he would print it. Yeah, right. But I have other options. I could freelance. I could... I don't know what the fuck I'm gonna do, man. It just happened to me. Well, shit, don't talk about it if you're gonna be so goddamn touchy. Touchy about what? He got canned. By the Voice. Jesus! Do you have to tell her everything? Yes, I tell her everything. What happened? Did you start screwing the secretary and your boss found out? -[Sheila laughs] -[Keith laughs sarcastically] Is that what you think of me, Sheila? That's what I know about you, Keith. Thank you, honey. And anything I'm missing I'm sure my sister can fill in for me. Oh, your sister? She and Todd are actually getting engaged. Engaged? Wait, wait. Todd? The guy that she met through the personals? That's right. He's a wonderful man, he treats her like gold, and she's very happy. Hey, you know, I'm happy for her. You know what? That's what you ought to do. You ought to write about the personals. -I don't give a fuck about that. -A lot of people do it. I don't care if a lot of people use it. I don't understand why anybody would do that. Especially a man, like Todd. I mean, come on. Think about it. Women outnumber men, right? So, whether you like it or not, there will come a time when every woman is gonna have to share her man. Why put an ad in the paper for that when you can do it for free? You think you live in some kind of "Our Man Flint" film where you can have two and three and four women all up on you at the same time and nobody's gonna do anything about it, and that's just not the way the real world works. It isn't. You need to grow up. And speaking of the real world, when was the last time you heard from Sue? -Waiter! -Not in a long time, right? Five years, Keith. Five! And you didn't give her a commitment. That's why she cheated on you. That's why she left you. That woman loved you. You know what, Sheila? Do me a favor. I just got fired, okay? You wanna cut me some slack? I'm just speaking the truth, brother! Plus, it was slack that probably got your butt fired in the first place. What happened to you, Keith? You won all those awards. Writing was your life. How did you screw up the one thing that meant more to you than anything else? Hello? Where were you? Gina. Why didn't you call me last night like you said you would? Uh, listen, Gina, I apologize, um... I fell asleep. I've just got so much research to do on this project, it's just overwhelming me, I'm sorry. Well, why didn't you call me when you got up? Because I just got up. Hello? I don't believe you were working last night. Why don't you believe me, Gina? I don't believe that you have to work tonight, either. Look, Gina, if you don't trust me, it doesn't matter what the hell I say to you because you're not gonna believe me anyway. [Gina] Look, I've been thinking, and I can't take this anymore. -[Keith] All right, fine. -[Gina] I mean it this time. Gina, what the hell do you want me to say to you? Come on, you've said this how many times? Yeah, and now you don't give a shit, right? -No, I didn't say that. -Fuck you. I don't need to be treated like this. You wanna be with somebody else, then go ahead, because I'm not gonna take this shit anymore. You can go fuck yourself. Gina, let me tell--Gina? Gi-- Shit. Great. -Gina, this is-- -[man on phone] Keith Parker? [disguising voice] Hello? -Mr. Parker? -Yeah. If you do not send us a payment by this Friday -we will be forced-- -Who's calling? -This is New York collections-- -Yeah, he's not in right now. Uh, this is Phillip, his roommate. [Sally] Ed, I have Keith Parker on line 34. No, tell him I'm busy, Sally. [Sally] I already did. He won't hang up. He says he's got to talk to you. All right, Sally, put him through. [Keith] Ed? Yes, Keith, what is it? I'm very busy. [Keith] I know, and thank you for taking my call. I have an idea I want to run by you. It--it's-- -Spit it out, Keith. -It's about the personals. [Ed] Love it. And you know, I bet more people do it than you'd think. You do? Great, yeah, um... It was, um... an idea that just came to me. I guess you could call it a stroke of genius. Yes, Ed, I do remember your conditions. Sally, hold all my calls, please. Hi. My name is Lorraine. I'm 29, I'm a college graduate with a degree in business administration, and I'm not into group sex. [Keith] Hey, baby. [in deep voice] Yeah, baby. [in English accent] Cheers to you, darling. [in smooth voice] Hey there, how you doin'? This is, uh, the 30-year old, single black male. ...and I'm a college graduate, and I'm a bit of a movie buff. Twilight Zone, Star Trek. I believe every relationship is like an adventure, so... Baby, I'm as open as... well, I'll save the poetry for later. If you're down for the adventure and you got your own teeth, please leave a message. Maybe even send a picture to my email address, which is parker plenty dot com. Yeah, baby. I'll talk to you soon. [woman on voicemail] Yo, single black male, my name is Loquita. You sound like you got it goin' on, yo! But it ain't even about all that. [different woman] Hi, this is Annette Walker, and I love movies, too... [different woman] ...and I like what you said about relationships. I think they are an adventure. Oh, and by the way, I'm a huge Star Trek: The Next Generation fan. [woman] Hi. [indistinct] I forgot to give you my phone... [other woman] One requirement I insist on, though, is that you're open minded and understanding. I can only imagine what lies in the days to come. The days to come... [Keith] 30 women in 30 days, a personals journal. [Leah on voicemail] I noticed you didn't leave your name on the message, so I won't leave mine. You said a lot, but nothing. My guess is either you're a writer, or full of shit, or both. I might call again. I might not. I don't know, it depends on my mood. Hey, Loquita, this is Keith. Yeah, single black male from the personals. Listen, I was thinking that we could kill two birds with one stone. No, no, it's a saying. I'm not gonna kill anything. No, I didn't make it up. No, it means do two things at the same time. Like eat and get to know each other. Yeah. Tonight? All right, great. How about 6 pm? Yeah, there's a place downtown called Chalet. Okay. I'll meet you there. All right, cool. I'll be wearing a tan jacket, and glasses. What is your problem man? There are 5,000 phones in New York, my man. [Keith on answering machine] Hey Liz, this is Keith. I know you're not home from work yet. I'm calling your machine because, baby, I'm in a hurry. I'm on my way to a really important meeting, and, um, I'm not gonna make it tonight. I know it's your parents' anniversary, and I know I promised, and I hate that I have too much work. I'll give you a call first thing in the morning, okay? I'm really sorry. [Loquita shouting] Yo, yo, yo! Tan jacket! You must be Keith! How ya doing? Uh-uh, you fine! I didn't think you was gonna be this fly. I was thinking, you know, you gonna be some ugly-ass nigga putting his ass in the personals! I'm glad you approve. Listen at you, "I'm so glad you approve." Sounds so intellectualized! I can't stand niggas that don't know shit. Let's sit down, I'm starving. There you go. -Thank you. -Sure. Right. Like you was a natural blonde! -So. You ain't cheap, is you? -Um, no, I don't think so. Good, because I hate cheap-ass niggas that don't know how to treat a lady. Fill-let mig-non. What's that? That sounds good, they got some kinda chips or something? Yeah, they probably have, um, pommes frites. What's that? They're like little skinny French fries. Mm. Then I'm set. -Whatchu gonna get, homie? -Uh... I'm like, aww shit! Let me get the hell out of here! I didn't want no problems, you know what I'm saying? [chews loudly] [singsong] But homegirl is getting paid, though. Cha-ching! [giggles] "Call me"? Like I'm gonna be home at night! I was like, nigga please, I ain't even sweatin' that. Because some men don't like to go "downtown," you know what I'm saying? But I was like, too through. And he was taking down crazy cash! But a roughneck, hard-headed gangsta motherfucker? Uh-uh. I wanted to put a cap in his ass. -[loud thump] -[cutlery clanks] I said naw, it ain't even about all that. No man is worth all this heartache. Not over some bitch. She can have his tight ass. I be like, stressin'. And I ain't even about all that. So anyway, we was kickin' it with a 40 and a blunt, and you know what? She started poppin' some shit! I was like, yo. I know she's your homegirl and all that, but she ain't nothing but a tight-ass hoe to me! I said, come up around my house and talk that shit. Because my pit bull Tyson is hungry and he loves the taste of store-bought, low-budget, no-count, tacky-ass 125th Street bitches like you! Hmm! You want some? A: Twenty years old. B: Six-year-old child. Damn. C: Never been married. D: Is tired of roughnecks and wants to settle down. E: Is looking for a... [imitating Loquita] "quiet older man with loot to take care of her and her daughter." F: Never had filet mignon before. [woman on voicemail] Keith, it's me, Gina. I'm sorry, Keith. It's just that I love you so much and I don't want to lose you. I know you're under pressure from losing your job and I'm sorry, and I don't want to leave you, you know that. I want to be with you. So call me tonight if you can, please. Hey Gina, this is Keith. I just got your message. I'm really sorry about the other day, too. But how about I come by tonight around 11. Okay? All right, bye, baby. [woman on phone] Eye color? Uh... brown. Dark or light? -Dark. -Oh. Any history of disease in the family? What do you mean? I mean cancer, epilepsy, stroke, high blood pressure, sickle cell anemia, depression, hemophilia, glaucoma, speech impediment, any heart disease? No, not that I'm aware of. Well, I think that just about does it. I was looking for green or grey eyes, but since you seem to fit all the other specifications, I... guess we can meet for dinner. Well... great. [Keith] Okay, let me make sure I get this straight. You want a man to father your child, right? But no romance? And no relationship, no financial support, nothing. Just straight sex, for reproductive purposes? Precisely! Well, what makes you think that I or any man would be into that? Don't you find me attractive? Yeah, I do, very. Well then there you have it, that's a start. "K" for Keith... Here, that's for you. You can follow along. Now. I propose the following. I'm offering you the opportunity to copulate with me, the end result being a child. A child for which you will have absolutely, and I do mean none whatsoever, financial responsibility. No strings attached. As you can see there, I've scheduled up to six liaisons a month. During each sexual encounter I will pay for dinner, and a movie, or the theater. Your choice. We will continue having sex until I become pregnant. Oh, and during that time, I don't mind if you see other people. I only ask one thing, and that is that you perform safe sex. Cute, isn't it? [giggles] So, there you have it. Good food, good fun, good sex. What more could a man ask for? Well, uh... the straight sex part? I'm totally into that. But the reproductive part? I mean... How can I have a child that's part of me, running around, that I have no connection to? Keith, this is a good opportunity. It really is. I mean, it works for me, and no worry for you. See, I would worry about that. There's nothing attractive to me about being a human sperm bank. Keith, I don't think you understand-- No, Chantal, I'm sorry, but I don't think you understand, so, here you are, and thank you for dinner. Keith? You're just walking out on me like that? You're just leaving? Keith, I didn't mean to offend you, I really didn't-- Are you single? Why, yes, I am. -Would you like to have a drink? -Certainly. I love green eyes. [Mick] You're telling me that this fine-ass honey wanted you to have sex with her, no strings attached, and you said no? Get the fuck outta here! [Keith] I know you find this hard to believe with your sorry-ass life, but you know what? That is not my point. Put your ass in place and get ready. -What is the point? -The point is... [sighs] yours. How about I give her your number? There. Now you're talking, black man. Yo, so what's going on with Elizabeth? Oh man, don't even ask. I saw her again last night. -Another fight? -No, it's the same one. I mean, I don't understand. I see this woman three or four-- more times than I see Gina, and she's still not happy. What am I supposed to do? My advice? Stop fucking around. [Keith] Since when are you so moral? Moral ain't got nothing to do with it. If your women can't satisfy you, and you can't satisfy your women, stop making each other miserable. Yeah, I wish my life were that simple. It is. You just make it complicated. Like that missed shot. Game, set and match. You ain't no match for me. I'm Jordan, you are the Knicks! Can't anybody out here play me! Are there any Puerto Ricans in the house! [Keith] You're gonna dance for me? So how'd you like to be tied up? [laughing] Stop, you're making me blush! That's okay, what's wrong with a little color on you, redbone? You know, I've been talking so much about me. I want to know more about you. Uh-uh, nope. It's all about you. -Well... -Miss Annette. Well, besides my acting, I also sing and dance. Really? I could probably come out with a R&B record, kind of like Whitney Houston, with some rap tracks behind it. Because I rap too. I've been writing raps since I was 12. [waiter] This is for you. Then I was thinking I should probably produce my first Broadway musical. That's something else I want to do in the next couple of years. Then I could dance for you afterwards. -After I do my Broadway show. -Excuse me. -Where'd she go? -She went out there. -Who gave you that note? -Woman about so high, she was very pretty, she had some real nice-- -Come on, man! Where'd she go? -She went out that door. She just came and gave you a note and left? -No. -No what? She was here hours ago sitting at the bar. Hours?! Then she called me over, gave me the note, told me to give it to you five minutes after she leaves. How long ago did she leave? -Ten minutes ago. -Jesus Christ. [Annette] Excuse me. -[smack] -[Keith grunts] That's for the poor woman you planned on cheating on with me. She should've did it before she left. Don't even think of calling me again, you bastard! How could you do this to me? She said five minutes, so you gave her an extra five minutes just to see what would happen? Hey, pal, it's not my problem. It's your life. Tip's not included. My name's Pete. [Leah on voicemail] So what have I learned about you so far? You're secretive. Or merely cautious. You don't call when you say you will. You use words well. And you're very comfortable playing phone tag. Conclusion: You're either a fake, easily distracted, an artist, or just not used to having your words mean anything. [Keith] It had to be Liz, man. I think what she did is check my date book, you know? I mean, I've been calling her all day and all night and she won't return any of my phone calls-- [Mick] What was in it? -What? The date book? -Yeah. Oh, yeah, well, [sighs] just the next 15 dates with 15 women and where I'm gonna meet them. -You fucked up. -Yeah, thank you very much. [Mick] Damn, they're so young! Yo, we all going to jail. Yo, look at it like this. You're always complaining Liz takes up too much of your time, and now you don't have to worry about Gina. I'm telling you, C'est la vie, man. Easy come, easy go. No, I care about her. Right. Then why do you have other women? Shut up. I care about all of them. [Mick] Whatever. [Keith] Mick, Mick-- -[Mick] Mm-mm-mm! -[Keith] Hello! She plays so beautiful, don't you agree? Yo, I gotta sit down after that one. I'm telling you, that was a Keith Parker special if I ever saw one. Yo, she wanted you, my brother. -[Keith] I want one of those. -[Mick] You? -One day. -Yeah, right. Hey, next case. Have you had any really interesting calls? Yeah, there's this really weird one. This woman is... she's weird, bro. We've only talked through, you know, phone tag, but... Damn! You know what? I was supposed to call her last night. I forgot, with this Liz situation. Could you do me a favor? Could you be a little more vague? I'm sorry, I... she's just... She's intriguing. Okay... [Mick] So, what you got going on tonight? This is going to sound... I don't know how this is going to sound to you, but you are a very beautiful woman. I cannot believe that you are single. [speaking Spanish] [giggles] You being single just doesn't make sense to me. Thank you. Well, I'm a fiercely loyal person. And my last boyfriend was a lowlife, a liar and a cheat. [indistinct] I haven't really met anyone that I felt I could trust. I hate liars. I think they should all be strung up by their balls and gutted so their intestines spill out all over them as they die in agony. [Keith clears throat] I hate liars, too. Hate them. Would you like another one? Well, two is usually my limit. Can I trust you if I get drunk? Oh, absolutely. Scout's honor. Waiter! -Two more, please. -Sure. I don't know what this will sound like, but has anybody ever told you that you are a very sexy looking man? Never. -Am I being to forward? -No. Come on. You know, some men don't like it when a woman is too aggressive. But I believe that when you see something you like you should go for it. Because if you don't, somebody else will. Do you agree with that? I one hundred percent agree. [giggles] I'm not shy, I'm just picky. I like a man who knows what he likes. Do you really like what you see? Sí, sí señorita. [waiter] Here you go. [laughing] Flattery will get you everywhere, young man. All I have to do is speak the truth, right? And the truth is, you are a beautiful, beautiful woman. Not to mention, sultry. Sultry? What's that, like, sexy? Yeah, sexy, but with, like, sophistication. Ooh, I like that. Sultry. Sexually sophisticated. What else do you know how to use well, besides words? [laughs] Well, what can I say? Using my god-given gifts is... a talent, and I do love to use all of my [breathing heavily] god... given... gifts. Ay, Dios mío, Keith! You are a gifted man. Check! Whatcha doing, mi amor? [Keith grunts in pain] I'm trying to check my voicemail. So, who called? Oh, it really doesn't matter, does it? [both chuckle] [Veronica] Who's that, your girlfriend? No, that's probably my roommate, Phil. -I meant on the phone. -Oh, no, that was, uh... a client, from a project I'm working on. [knocks at door] Should I put something on? Not on my account. -What's up, bro? -What's up, bro? Hi. I'm Veronica. You certainly are, Veronica. -[giggles] Oh. -I'm Phil. [Veronica] Excuse me. Hope I'm not disturbing anything. Too late. You missed all the fun last night. [Keith] Phil, can I have a word with you, bro? Tell me that you do have the check. Oh, Keith, buddy, man, let me tell you what happened-- I don't care about what happened, bro. The rent is due on the first. This is the second of the next month. But here's the thing, though-- Keith, man, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's just that-- Okay, Wednesday. Wednesday, definitely. I have no other money coming in. I'm living off plastic right now. -Don't fuck me. -Dude. Would I fuck you? You already have! -Nice meeting you, Veronica. -Likewise. Listen, um, You couldn't spot me a twenty till Wednesday, could you? Just asking. ...and you really like Star Trek? Love Star Trek. Bigger fan of Next Generation, though. What? You like Picard over Kirk? -In a heartbeat. -No, girlfriend. Kirk was the man, okay? Let me just tell you that. -Kirk was a Neanderthal. -No, he wasn't. Kirk is like-- May I get you something to drink? Yeah, a Red Stripe, please. Tea. Earl Grey. Hot. "Hot." That's cute. -You don't drink alcohol? -No, I try not to. All right. So, we've established that you love the original Star Trek, right? But what did you love about it? Mr. Spock. The costumes the women wore. I like the costumes better on classic Trek. But I must say, on some of the 3rd and 4th season TNG, Robert Blackman did some nice work. Wow, you really know your stuff. Costuming is my secret passion. Mundanes don't understand it, though. -I'll show you something. -Is it passionate? -I think you'll like it. -Oh yeah baby. I get dressed up at all the Cons. -This is you? -Yeah, that's me. [Keith] Wow. [Melanie] That's me with Wookiee at Worldcon '96. [Keith gasps] Oh, this one is really hot. [Melanie] Thanks. And this one got me third prize journeyman division at Costume-Con. Excuse me, did you say Costume-Con? -Yes. -That's you! -You were at EveCon in '95. -Yes? -You were the Amazon warrior? -That was me! Yeah! I'm Guinevere. Um, this is... -Abdul. -Abdul. -Hi, I'm Melanie. This is Keith. -[Keith] Uh, how do you do? -May we, um... -By all means! Thank you. Come on, Abdul. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt, but I heard you talking about Next Gen, and Picard, and-- [Keith] Wait, wait, wait. Okay. Now. -Picard or Kirk? -Picard. Are you a DS9 fan, too? I wasn't at first, but now I am. Not Voyager yet, though. Oh, you should watch. It's getting really good. I mean, Next Gen wasn't good till third season. I was just saying that! -[Guinevere] May I see those? -[Melanie] Absolutely. I have more, too do you want to see more? Oh, gosh, definitely! [Melanie] I have some from Miami. Were you in Miami? No, I wasn't in Miami, actually. Okay, well these are from Miami. These are fabulous. Fabulous. I make all the costumes, I do all of it. You do? Yeah, not the jewelry, just the costumes. I know someone who makes jewelry though, you should get together. -Futuristic stuff? -Yeah, of course, of course. -He's still in there? -Uh-huh. Those chicks are in there too? Mala hierba nunca muere. Bad grass never dies. Yeah, he's... he's a stud. -See ya, Jaime. -Good night, Pete. Take off that stupid hat. [drunken chatter] -[Keith] Look at this! -[both laugh] Let me tell you something. We ain't the problem, bro. American men, we know how to treat our women, okay? This is the land of opportunity. Come on, I saw Booty Call, I know. No, it's you Indian motherfuckers, okay? With all your wives and shit. -What? -That's right. That is not true. Even if that were true of my country, that of which you speak, okay, at least having more than one wife is honest to the woman. You American men, you have one wife, one woman you call wife, and then many, many other women outside. -That's right. -That is not right! See, you American men, you treat your women much worse. It is because-- I'll tell you why-- It is because you do not know who you are, and therefore, you do not know what you want. -Aha! -[Keith grunts] [breathing heavily] [thud] My pobrecito. [laughs gently] -[Keith] Oh! -Who were you expecting? Veronica, how did you get in here? You let me in, silly. But not before you cursed at me for not having a key. Which was kind of cute. I'm only waking you up because it's 11:30 and you have to get up. [Keith] 11:30? Oh my god. [exhales deeply] Wait, how long have you been here? About five hours. I cleaned up. You were right, your roommate is a slob. But we had a nice conversation. [giggles] He told me all about you. -[smooches] -Oh, he did, did he? You smell like you've been drinking. I told everyone who called to call back later. What happened to my machine? I just kept picking up the phone before the machine answered. Don't worry. I told everyone who called to call back later. All except for one. What was her name? Gina, I think? She said she was your ex-girlfriend and you don't have to bother calling her back. [heavy metal music] You Keith? Yes. [whispers] Spider! [Keith coughs] So, you wanna fuck? -[glass breaking] -[unknown man] I do. Gina, why haven't you returned my calls? I called you all day yesterday and last night. [Gina] Mm-hmm. And still, you didn't get the message. Come on, what's this about? Why don't you ask that little Puerto Rican bitch who's answering your phone. Gina, come on. You didn't even give me a chance to explain. [Gina] I am sick of your fucking explanations, Keith. You have never allowed me to answer your phone. Never. And the one time I did you almost ripped my fucking head off. -Gina, it's not what you think-- -It's so clear to me now, Keith. It's so clear how full of shit you are. You're a writer. It's your job to get people to believe or care about whatever you have to say. Well, end of story, asshole! -But-- -[dial tone] Damn! [doorbell buzzing insistently] C.O.D. Twelve dollars. For K. Parker. Sign here. Do you know who this is from? I don't particularly care where it's from. [Keith scoffs] -I don't have all day. -Okay. -Do you want this? -Oh, yeah. -Have a nice day. -Thank you. Liz. [sighs] Come on, Liz. Not you, too. [phone keys beep] The number you have reached has been disconnected. [sighs] [phone clunks on windowsill] [sighs] Why is this happening to me? [Leah on voicemail] So, this is about my sixth message. The last time I heard your voice you sounded a little upset. When things aren't going well, you've got to ask yourself: What have I done to create this situation in my life? Until we finally speak, tag, you're it. P.S. You still haven't told me your name. [voicemail beeps] [jazz saxophone music] Coltrane? Oh, you must be depressed. What happened this time, was she fat? No, fat girls are for you. I still gotta hand it to you, man. What a scam! You get to meet all these lonely, horny chicks who will fuck you right away, and you ain't even gotta go looking for them. They're looking for you! Phil, this is not a scam, okay? This is for a story. Right, a porno story. And I wanna [indistinct] No, a fucking horror story that's destroying my whole life. See, you know where you fucked up, dude? Telling her your real name and giving her your real number. I mean, you brought it home. Hell, no. How was I supposed to know? You're supposed to go to their house. But you inspire me, man. See, I'm placing my own ad. But I got a separate voicemail as my home phone number. See, you gotta use your brain, man! I mean, you're a writer, what's wrong with you? Oh, you know. See, Veronica, man? She woulda been great for one night. But having her up here, all up in your shit? Answering your phone, dude? Not a good move. Not a good move at all. Phil, thank you very much for pointing out all the bad moves I've been making. Thank you. Uh-huh, who is it this time? Liz, or Gina the screamer? Don't ever let Gina know that you hear her, okay? How could she think I couldn't? I mean, the doorman downstairs can hear her. You won't have to worry about Gina or Liz anymore because they both dumped me. Look, man, cheer up. Maybe you'll meet the woman of your dreams in one of those video personals you were telling me about. See, I think that's a cool idea, because at least you don't have to waste money on a date with some dog. [scoffs] Right? You're 50 dollars short on that rent, bro. Forty. [door closes] [jazz bass music] I'm sorry, what was your name again? -Julian. -Julian, Right, Julian. Sorry. I'm so bad with names. [Lorraine exhales deeply] Well. Julian. You know, I have to be totally honest with you here. I've never done... this before. Oh, me either. No--well, I mean, the video personals thing, that's a first, too. Thank you. It's funny, because I said to myself, this woman is way too fine to be looking for some date on a video-- What? What did I say? Look, I am not a piece of meat on display for you. I dress this way for work, okay? Listen, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to sound like that. It's just-- you are just nice looking. Funny how I didn't ask you if you liked the way I looked. I'm sorry if I offended you. I just... Look, why don't you just say whatever you were gonna say and I'll just listen. Okay. What I meant was--is-- I don't usually date-- black men. Actually, I never date black men, and this is exactly the reason why. Wait, what's the reason why? You know, black men always treating you like you're a piece of ass. Oh, please. I don't think that black men have an exclusive license on that type of behavior. Yeah, well, they've certainly perfected it, haven't they? -See, white men-- -What-- No, white men, they know how to treat a woman like a lady. Please. White men like who? Bill Clinton? [scoffs] No. White men like the man I met recently. See, he's decent, intelligent, -he knows lots of celebrities. -So? Actually, he's the editor for the Voice. [chokes] His wife--ex-wife-- really hurt him in his previous marriage, and he's now looking for someone to share his life with. You know, to tell the truth, we went on more than one date, and now he wants to take me on a trip. The only reason I'm here is because my girlfriend told me that I should give you "black men" a chance. [Lorraine chuckles] Oh, well, I'm very happy to be here representing for all the brothers of the world. -Uh-huh. -Uh-huh. Excuse me? [Keith] Jeez... -Do you have any Pellegrino? -Mm-hmm. Great. Can I get one with a twist of lime and a glass of ice on the side? -Sure. -Thank you. [waiter] Uh... Yeah, you know, my man, yo. Hook me up with a forty of like, St. Ides or something, yo. I'm just joking. [sighs] May I have a gin and tonic, please? -[waiter] Okay. -Oh, please. I hope you don't have a drinking problem, because that would be just too much. Okay. We have obviously started off on the wrong foot. I have a big mouth, all right? I like to joke. And lately, I have had the worst luck trying to speak to women, so I apologize. And I did not mean to make you feel like you were on display. So I hope you can accept my apology. Well, I have been known to judge too quickly. Maybe you didn't mean anything by it. No, I didn't. [chuckles] Okay. I accept your apology, and I thank you for the compliment. Good. Why don't we just order some food, and let's talk, which is what we came here for in the first place. -[Lorraine] Mm-hmm. -And you can tell me why you hate the entire black male population. Except for me, of course. Well, I don't know you yet. [chuckles] And it's not that I don't like the entire black male population. No, it's just those, you know, hip-hoppy, gangster, all women are hoes and bitches, "yo, you got nice titties" and "why don't you stop and talk to me, you stuck-up bitch," irresponsible, beat up your wife, can't hold a job, cheat on me with a white woman, alcoholic, on parole, dropped out of high school, think that all women secretly want to be raped type. You know. Most black men. Not all. Ah, I think she's here. -Hello, brother Julian. -Hello, sister Leatha. [waiter] Over here. [waiter] There we go. So, that's a... that's a nice... wrap. Thank you. It's called a gele. Would you like something to drink? Yes, I would. Bailey's and cream. Okay, Bailey's and cream. Can we have a Bailey's-- no, make that two Bailey's and cream. -[Leatha] You like Bailey's? -I love it. [Leatha] It's so expensive, though. But it tastes good. [chuckles] Goes down cold, but warms you inside. Oh, yeah. Warm inside. Exactly as it's supposed to be, right? [chuckles] Yeah, I think so. Thank you. -[glass breaks] -Oh, look at that! -We'll get you another one, sir. -[Leatha] Please do. So, you see a lot of movies? What movies have you seen recently? Um... the last movie I saw was that re-make of The Courtship of Eddie's Father. -Why? -Why what? Why see movies like that? Unless it's for Whoopi "sell-out sister" Goldberg. Oh, I see. You don't like Whoopi Goldberg. I don't like any African Americans that allow themselves to be romantically or physically involved with-- white people. Why don't you come out of your shell and say how you really feel, Leatha? [both laugh] I don't mean to sound racist but I just don't like, trust or respect white people. And I have no respect for blacks that get with them. So I guess you'd never do that, huh? Don't get me started. Look at LaToya Jackson. Need I say more? Or Dionne Warwick. She was with that white man all those years and now look at her, doing that psychic network stupidity. Wait, what white man? Burt Baklava or Bucarat or something. -Burt Bacharach. -Mm-hmm. They wrote songs together, they didn't go out. Yes they did. -They did? -That's right. Sidney Poitier--and I love him as an actor, but I have no respect for him as a black man. Diahann Carroll, Alfre Woodard, Diana Ross, Richard Pryor. God don't like ugly. SOS's and SOB's. Sell-out sisters and sell-out brothers. Got lost in that crossover dream. Lost their mind and their bloodline. And let's not forget OJ Simpson, do I even have to speak on it? [buttons beeping] [phone ringing] [exhales deeply] [button beeps] -Hello? -Hi honey! Why haven't you returned my phone calls? -Liz? -Excuse me? Veronica. Oh, um... I've been busy on this project. I miss you. Can I see you tonight? No, I can't. Look, Veronica? I need to talk to you about the other day. [anxiously] I won't come by unannounced again, I promise. You just tell me what time you want me to meet you. I can be late, I don't mind. It's warm out. I can wait outside downstairs until you're ready to see me. No, we can't do that. Look, Veronica, you're a sweet girl-- -Sweet on you. -[Keith sighs] All right. I'll meet you. I'll meet you tonight, but it's got to be outdoors. Ooh, kinky! [giggles] [Keith] Dinner with Leatha amounted to essentially more of the same. Eleven through fifteen were a bit of a blur, some more than others. Number 12. Katie. She told me she worked in the theater. She just left out a few little details. Hi, hi, hi. Julian, right? -Julian? -You are? -I'm Katie! -Katie? -Katie, yeah! -Oh, hey, how are you? Good, I'm good-- -[balloon pops] -[Katie yelps] Jesus, right? Oh my gosh, this birthday party I was just working went much later than it was supposed to. -I didn't have time to change. -Okay, um... [Keith chuckles] -Would you like something? -Oh, god, yeah. Don't mind if I do. I'm starving and I sure could use a fucking drink. -Okay. -[Katie grunts] So what happened? I don't know where to begin, man. And where the hell were you the last few days? I had to take off. Marriage shit to take care of. -You don't wanna know. -You're right about that. Hey, what happened with you and that Puerto Rican chick? You were gonna give her the blow-off. She's crazy, man. After number 11, right, I tell her, look, why don't we go to the park and talk? I mean, I tried. I tried to let her down easy. -Good move. -No, bad move. -She flipped on me. -What? She started screaming at me, dude. She started saying, [in accent] "You're just like my ex-boyfriend, you wanna throw me away like I'm a piece of garbage, all men are pigs." I don't need this. -Only you. -And then to make it worse, this woman, in public, hit me. And spit at me. You're lucky she didn't have a knife and stab your ass. -[Mick laughs] -Mick, this is not funny. Phil was right. You should've never told her your real name. You let her into your crib. She was like, " Ay papi, I love you Keith." Do we have to go through this again? -What do you think of this one? -I think it makes you look fat. Your mama like it. I don't understand why you gave her the blow-off anyway. I mean, you lost two. Isn't it time to replace? She's not what I want. That would imply you knew what you wanted. And that's impossible, because this is Keith Parker I'm talking to, right? All I know is that this woman called me 27 times--27 times-- to curse at me in Spanish. -Change your number. -What if Gina or Liz calls? [Mick laughs] [in accent] Welcome to Fantasy Island. [snaps fingers] Tattoo, please, talk to my friend Keith. He's living in a fantasy world. [electronic music] Amber? Oh. Sorry. -Is your name Amber? -Julian! So we meet at last. Shall we grab a cozy little table? [clears throat] Um... Um, before we do that, I just need to ask you a question. So soon? We hardly even know each other. [clears throat] Are you, um... Are you sure you're really a woman? [belly laughs] It's funny you should ask that. All my life, people have always asked me [in deep voice] the exact opposite. [Keith inhales] [Leah on voicemail] Long time no hear. This is Leah. I got your message. So, I guess you haven't found what you're looking for yet? Or are you even aware that you're looking for something? [Sheila] So, Keith, how many women have you dated so far? [Keith] Uh... 19. I had two dates yesterday, one in the daytime and one in the evening. -When do you find time to write? -Mostly during the day. Whenever I'm not answering an ad or responding to a call to one of mine. But wait, what's up with the third degree? What do you think about the article so far? Well, I think it's, uh... I think it's funny. It's really funny. [Mick sighs deeply] And it's disturbing at points, which is good. -But? -But what? No, I know there's a "but." You're saying it's funny and it's disturbing at times. I know there's a "but" coming. Okay, it's just that I... Oh, man, I... [exhales] Sheila, I know that you cannot be at a loss for words, okay? So why don't you just spit it out? Okay. He asked for it. It's missing the personal element, Keith. You know? I mean, it's got all this description of all these women and all the different things they do, and how strange some of them are and sure, I feel sorry for some of them, but, you know, so what? I mean, there's no you in it. What did you learn? What are you learning about yourself? Anything? How can you say that there's no me in there? Because there's not. I can't see that this affected you at all. Did your life change at all? Of course my life changed. Hello! I lost two girlfriends. I spent $1,800 that I cannot get back. Of course my life changed. Not only am I lonely, I'm broke. Okay, that? That's not in here. Of course it's not in here. This is an article. This isn't my biography. Well, maybe it should be, Keith. I don't know, okay? I just know it's not honest. How can you say this is not honest? I did not create this. This stuff really happened. Please don't tell me you're this dense. You can't be this dense. You write this thing, Keith-- walk away if you want, I don't care-- you write this thing like it didn't affect you, and I know that it did. Stop, honey. -Look, maybe it affected Julian. -Why, who's Julian? [Keith] Shut up, okay? Julian does not exist, and you are an asshole. Asshole. Who's Julian? You know how Batman has Bruce Wayne? Julian is his... alter ego. [laughing loudly] I'm not lying. Am I lying? That's not funny. Tell me you don't pretend to be someone else when you go on these dates? Okay, look, it got a little hectic so for the last... half-dozen dates, I-- [laughing] [Mick] Julian. For the last half-dozen dates, I used a different name. Oh, honey. You're so ashamed of who you are, you can't just be yourself? [Mick] Whoa. Brother, all I want to know is, who is next? -[Keith] I'm starving. -I'm starving, too. [indistinct] Bam! [exhales] [both laugh] Well, you were saying that you'd written a poem? Yeah, I did. Do you want to hear it? It's not finished, but it's about you. Oh. -Certainly. -Okay, if you insist. Okay. It's called "Waiting." [Keith] What are you-- [sighs] Waiting to meet the voice. Waiting of course, by choice. Is that him? That ugly man? Is that him, with that broken hand? As I wait here, waiting, contemplating, I mean, just what is this thing called dating? Just meeting someone you hardly even know and you're hoping not to let it show. Will he end up loving me? Or will I end up killing him? A crime of passion, his head chopped off, chopped! Blood! That's all. -[cheers and applause] -[giggles] [cheers] That was, uh... intense. No, no, that was not intense. That was just a silly rhyme thing. Now, my real poetry? That is intense. [gasps] [waiter] Um... Do you need anything? I'll have a decaf. I'll have a chardonnay, please. Thank you. -I'll bring the whole bottle. -No, no... So, I have one more. Sort of like an after-dinner poem. And it's called "After Dinner." Wanna hear it? [indistinct] -Sherie? -Keith? Hi. Listen, I'm so sorry I'm late. The president must be in town or something, -it's crazy out there. -Oh, don't worry about it. [waiter] Oh, sorry. Yeah. -[Sherie] Here? -[Keith] Yeah. So, Keith Parker, we finally meet. Wow, we made this date about two weeks ago and never spoke since. -About two weeks. -You must be a really busy man. Yeah, I've been really busy but it's probably not what you're thinking. -You drinking? -Oh, yeah, a Coke please. I don't drink unless I'm in for the evening. Oh. So, do you mind if I drink? Oh, by all means, go ahead. I just want to say again that I'm so sorry I was late. How long were you waiting? It's okay, I came early. I was watching the game, it was fine. That's right, the Knicks are playing Houston. -How are they doing? -They're losing, as usual. Do you follow the WNBA at all? It's funny you should say that. I used to play in high school. -Really? -Yeah. -Do you still play? -Uh, no, I can't. Why not? Well, remember when we spoke, how I said I was looking for someone open-minded? Well, Just say it. I don't know why I'm so nervous about telling people this still. I mean, it's not like I'm a recovering heroin addict or something. It's just a fact of my life, and... I only have one leg. I wear a prosthetic limb. -I wasn't prepared for this. -Prepared for what? You thought they were all gonna be freaks, and they are. So? -That's not what I mean, man. -'Splain to me then, man. I was wrong, okay, Mick? I was wrong. You know, one of these women I dated, she actually dated my boss through the personals. My boss! This was a black woman that hates to date black men. -What kind of shit is that? -Sister gotta get paid. All of them, they've been hurt, they've been... I don't know, Mick. Sherie, the one-legged one? She was nice. Nice looking, too. I almost gave her my home number. -Dude, dude. -She already had my name. She was one of the first people to answer my ad. -And? -And, she knew exactly what she was looking for in a relationship. She said that losing her leg forced her to look at exactly what she needed in her life, so she could be happy. And she was prepared for any reaction I would've had. And then she said, well, what about you, Keith? What do you need to be satisfied? And... I didn't know. What I'm beginning to realize is that I'm committed to not being committed to anyone. [chokes] So, you're Julian Meyers? Yeah. And you must be Leah. -Hmm. -What? -I don't see it. -You don't see what? You don't look like a Julian to me. -You're an artist? -Yeah. -Musician. -Right, saxophone player. Exactly. Alto, baritone, soprano. So, are you consumed by your art? Do you always get so deep when you just meet somebody? I used to just trust that other artists understood commitment, you know? But, of course, that was before I started dating musicians. [coughs] What's wrong with musicians? Nothing. I love musicians. Especially saxophone players. I guess it's because of how a good saxophone player can make me feel. You mean, through his playing, right? At first. Okay. Julian, I'm going to be honest with you. I am not looking for a soulmate. I'm writing a thesis paper. That's why I agreed to meet with you without speaking to you. You just seem like such an archetype to me. But you don't seem like other saxophone players I've met. Maybe I'm not. Maybe. -Thank you. -[waiter] And for the lady? I'll have a glass of white wine, please. So, what's your paper called? "Why They Cheat." Subtitled, "Men and what they're missing." I'm interviewing 100 men and 100 women. And what number am I? Actually, you're number 101. I finished my interviews over a week ago. Had you not said you were a saxophone player, I wouldn't have called you back. But I couldn't resist seeing if you were full of shit or not. Why do men cheat? I don't know if I should tell you. Why? Because you may not be ready to deal with the truth about yourself. So you think I'm a man that cheats. Yes. -Why? -It's just a guess. This is from my paper. Men are taught at a very young age to value conquest. It is a measure of manhood and self-esteem. The most important being the sexual conquest. But to value conquest is to nurture desire. And to fulfil desire is a luxury of ego if it is devoid of a spiritual connection. Men wrestle with their desires on a constant, ongoing, moment-by-moment basis. And those who submit to their desires give strength to the part of them that is the least spiritual. The act of intercourse in the process of lovemaking is by no means devoid of spirituality. But as a mere function of desire fulfilment, it only increases the void it is trying to fill. No amount of outside love or lovemaking can replace that of self-love and give a man true self-esteem. And you wrote that? [Leah] You know, I understand that men cheat. I could even forgive a man for that. It's the dishonesty. -Don't they go hand in hand? -Usually, but not necessarily. A man who cheats can change, if he can become honest with himself. Admitting it can be a point of change. I was never faithful until I became honest with myself. Okay. [sighs] Well, to be honest with you, "Julian Meyers" is, um... [Chantal] Keith! Keith the writer! I thought it was you. I almost didn't recognize you in those clothes and everything. -Imagine running into you here! -Miss, you must be mistaken. -I just found out today that-- -Miss? -First of all, let me thank you. -Miss. Thank you for walking out on me the way you did. [indistinct] I'm pregnant! Waiter! Leah, don't leave yet, please! Oh, you're gorgeous! And I love the green eyes. [Keith] Wait, wait, don't go, Leah! Did I interrupt something? [woman and man moaning] [woman] Yeah! Phil! [grunting] [Gina shouts] Oh, Phil! [Gina screams] Oh, Phil! [Keith] I don't like to drink that much [belches] but, uh... [slurring] Excuse me. You have a good night. Wow. Whoa, whoa, whoa. [Jaime] So, it has caught up with you, see. -Wha--what? - Mentira. Lying. There is a saying in my country, Colombia. Primero cae un mentiroso que un cojo. A liar will fall on his face quicker than a man with one leg. Hey, buddy, how's it going? -[Keith] Is she gone? -Is who gone, dude? I can't believe you're even gonna try to lie about it. Lie about what? About fucking my ex-girlfriend, Phillip. Hey, man, we were drinking, and it just kind of happened. Just kind of happened? How could you? How could I what? You broke up with her, right? -She broke up with me. -Same damn thing. No, it's not the same damn thing. I cared about her. Yeah. So much that you were seeing other women? [scoffs] Who the fuck are you to judge me? Who the fuck are you to judge me? She answered my ad. I didn't know it was her. We spoke really briefly. We were both using fake names. Right, so then once you guys found out what the real names were then you figured it was okay to come fuck in my house! So what if Keith finds out, right? Damn! Phillip, I know you don't have any feelings for this woman. But what about mine? What about yours? Are you crazy? You see a different woman every night! That is for an article! Right, for an article. Well, I don't know where you find time to write the fucking article. And it shouldn't even be about personals. It should be about how you can't have a stable relationship with a woman, because you lie to all of them. I'm sorry, I didn't... Save it. I was just leaving. I was broke and I'd just been fired, so I decided to write an entertaining article about the personals scene. What could be more amusing than meeting women who had to advertise for dates? When I began writing this, I pretended to be looking for love. But everyone I dated, no matter how strange or bizarre their personality seemed, knew exactly what they wanted. In time, they forced me to see the obvious. [Loquita] Like I was saying, Many niggas be frontin' through the personals. It's like, "Attractive black male, Denzel lookalike." And then he shows up and it's like, you don't look like no Denzel! [laughs] I be like, I'll be lucky if I can get through my meal looking at your butt-ugly ass! [laughs] I ain't saying looks is everything, but damn! Don't get a girl's hopes up and shit. -You know what I'm saying? -I do. -So you're a reporter? -Mm-hmm. And this ain't no date. But you still paying, right? Hi, this is Leah. Leave me a message after the beep. Hello, Leah. Uh, This is, um, Julian? Well, you met me as Julian Meyers. My real name is Keith. Keith Parker. I'm calling because I hope that I can have another chance at getting to meet you. [tape recorder clicks] -[Yvette] Is it on? -Yep. Okay. My name is Yvette. Well, that's my professional name. Do I have to use my real name? Not if you don't want to. But why wouldn't you? I don't want anybody to know my real name. Not anybody from work, anyway. -Thank you for the flowers. -You're welcome. Anyway, so, my name is Yvette. I'm a topless dancer-- can I say "exotic dancer"? That sounds better. [whispers] Excuse me, sir. Do you have another credit card? No. Shit! Is there an ATM around here? No, there isn't. I can't believe this. Um... -Tonight's on me, it's alright. -What? [waiter] I mean, look at those. You're my hero. And I heard you had a rough one the other night. Yeah. Besides, I've won 10 times this on you already. I can always tell who your dates are. Oh, man. Hey, just keep bringing in a different one every night and I'll keep collecting. Yeah, okay. [waiter] So I'll put this on your account. Yeah, do that. -You have an account here? -Yeah. I come here all the time. So, your father? You have no unplayed messages. Damn. Hi, this is Leah. Leave me a message after the beep. Bye. Leah. Hey, this is Keith. I know you're probably not even listening to these messages but in a way, that's probably better because then nobody else but me will know how lost I feel. I got really hurt once. So I decided that I wouldn't let anyone mean that much to me again. So I picked women and relationships that I knew couldn't satisfy me. But what I've discovered is that the more you have, the less it means. The thing is, I'm really a writer. I'm working on an article about the personals, which is how I got into this whole thing in the first place. So, um... I'm gonna keep reading it to you on this tape until I fill up the tape and you either call me to say "Stop calling me, you fricking idiot" or whatever. [clears throat] Okay, here it goes. Keith, if the rest of this is as good as what I've got here, it's the best thing I've ever seen you write. I should fire all my staff writers if they're gonna freelance stuff like this. So I guess this means that you'll print it? Keith, not only will I print it, I'm gonna make it the cover story and run it in three parts. Excellent! I feel like I'm with you on those dates. Very insightful and honest piece of writing. Wow, Ed, I don't know what to say. Don't say anything, just finish it. Good work, Keith! When I get back, if you finish it on time I just might give you your old job back. Nah, that's okay, I don't want it. [laughs] Just kidding! Good to have the old Keith back. Thank you. [shouts with delight] Now that is an amazing story. One question. The woman who you revealed yourself to. Did she ever call you back? Unfortunately not. I find it hard to believe he's changed. I say, once a dog, always a dog. [host] Ooh! Well, Keith, any response? I think it's understandable if you see me that way, but the reality is I've changed, and I'd appreciate that kind of support But I think being a liar is like being an alcoholic. You just have to decide that you're not going to lie anymore. That's it. Ooh! Things that make you wanna go "Hmm"! Well, you certainly have made some interesting discoveries through this process, which is the subject of your next book, isn't it? Yes. The name of my next book is "I'll Let You Know" and it's all about commitment. [host] Well, we have a surprise for you. She's the author of a new book called "Why They Cheat: Men and what they're missing." Let's welcome Leah Matthews. Welcome to Chattin' America. Thank you. [indistinct] I'm very happy to be here. I'm proud of you. I read your book. [Keith sighs] I just didn't want to contact you until mine was published. I can understand that. -Um, I-- -Listen, I-- -You first. -No, go ahead. I just wanted to know if you had anything to do after this. Actually, yes, I do. I'm having dinner with a fellow published author friend of mine. -Oh, that's all right. -One who's grown quite a bit. That's good. Listen, before we go, I just want to be absolutely honest about my intentions. So I need to know if you-- Writing is a very lonely activity. Let's go. I'm starving. [Keith] So, I didn't want to talk about it on the air yet, but my book, it's been optioned as a film. [Leah] That's great! So, what are they going to call it? They're going to call it "Personals."
