I have to. Oh no. Goodness! Serves you right. Is it your turn? That's it? Just once. Try your luck, Grandpa. It's your turn. Nonsense. - You're just afraid of losing. - It's a waste of time. The kid hasn't even eaten yet. - Hi. - You came. - Where's the... - Hi. Hi. The reason I had to come over right this second? I'm going to see... If I can find it. "The reason". - Hungry? - I have to go to the watchtower. - Right now? - Yeah. There's just a couple hours of daylight left. - Take Akseli with you. - Yeah... We have to finish our game. The cards can wait. Go. - I don't have any hunting clothes. - I'm sure we have something. We've got some. For sure. Stay and eat. We have mashed potatoes and moose meat balls. Akseli hasn't eaten yet. No thanks. You sure? Your mom's baby, aren't you? You don't smoke. You don't drink. Well, maybe it's a good thing. How's school? Have you gotten detention? - We don't have detention. - Huh? No detention? How do they keep you under control? I'm a pretty quiet guy. False alarm. - There's mustard if you want. - This is fine. Have you been fishing lately? No. I was thinking... you might want to go to Lapland with me sometime. My friend has a cottage there. We were there last summer. We bathed in the sauna and fished. I'm allergic to fish. You're not allergic to girls, are you? - You must be dating a lot if you take after me. - Not really. Why not? You don't like girls? - Or they don't like you? - I just haven't met the right one. Well, if you do meet one... It's fine with me... To bring her to visit. You can get away from the hustle and bustle of the city. We'll see. There's one now. It's a moose. Where? I can't see. How can't you see it? Right there. Isn't it amazing? Where? You haven't seen moose in Helsinki, have you? - Guess not. - What? No. And neither did you when you lived there. Put your fingers in your ears. This will blow your eardrums. Huh? It's not moose season yet. You can only shoot deer. Akseli? Let's go swim. Hi, what's up? You're all drinking? Fuck, I just saw a shooting star. Yeah, I made a wish. I can't tell you, or it won't come true. I gotta go now. Don't drink too much. Bye. - You didn't come. - I don't like cold water. Why are flags at full mast? Fuck, it's Father's Day. Fuck. Then there's me. What can I say. I'm me, I'm 18 and I can do anything I want. - Hi. - Oh hi. At 8. - Oh, right. I can't today. - I thought we agreed. - My boss is going to kill me if he finds out. - No, he won't. You know what I mean. My 25th birthday is once a year and I want you there. - I'm gonna miss it this year... - No, you won't. Besides... This outfit is so hot. Perv. See you! - Why aren't you my friend anymore? - Why should I be? - What? Why can't I be your friend if I'm your mom? - That's why. That's exactly why. - It's not healthy that you know everything. - It's totally normal. Did your friends say something? I have a right to know what you're doing. Since you live here. Why did you unfriend me without saying anything to me? Tomas is your friend, my sister is. My best friend is, but I'm not. I can unfriend them if it helps. It would help if you tell me... When you're going to do something like that. - Hello? It's just Facebook. - "Just Facebook." I should never have joined. I'm tired of this. Besides, I'm busy. - DID YOU GET THE WEED? - YEAH. This is it. This is the final straw, Joni. - Why don't you say something. - I don't know what to say. Try! - I'm tired of trying. - Tired! You're both tired! - Why are you comparing me to Joni? - Because you're just as childish! I'm not childish. I know what I'm doing. You're right. Things haven't been great around here lately. That's not the reason. I understand you'd rather be somewhere else. I don't want to be home. It doesn't matter what it's like. You understand something has to change? You can't support yourself. You need to live here until you can. - If you live here, you have the same rules as everyone else. - Do you? If you don't believe me, believe Tomas. I understand you want to try things. I did too when I was young. That's different! Your parents didn't care about you! - Joni, it's in your genes. - Genes? Addiction is in your genes. You get it from your dad. You're saying my parents didn't care? - You could do anything you wanted! - We had free upbringing. Why do you go on about Dad? - He's doing great. Better than you! - Is that so? If he gets rich off trading stocks or selling drugs, it doesn't mean he's doing great! Financially maybe, but an addict is an addict. Can't we talk about ground rules like adults? Let's cease fire. Right, Joni? We'll do as I say. We'll do as we say, Joni! Right. We'll do as you say. - Don't go anywhere. - I'll get water. Is that forbidden too? This is awful. This is so awful. I knew this was going to happen. Sit down! Sit down! If it happens once, it'll happen again. - What fucking book is that from? - Don't talk to me like that! We're going to create rules and from this moment on... You'll have no more contact with your friends. You'll be home at 10 p.m. and you'll tell me everything you do. And I want to know what drugs you've done. Tomas will take care of that. - I will? - Yes! You will! I'll unfriend you both now! Hey Roope, is this enough? It should be full. - Okay. - If possible. I can't. I can't. - Sorry, if it's difficult... - We're ready now. Why don't we just start. Please tell us your version. Perfect. She organizes this and then doesn't show up. Well, she spied on my computer. I thought it was illegal to read other people's e-mails and texts. - She's the person closest to you. - Nope. And neither are you. - Who is? - My friends. They're paying for your school and upbringing? So it's okay for you to break the law... Because you pay for everything? If you live with someone, you can't keep secrets. How long have you been smoking pot? You don't have to answer. - Since last winter. - Last winter? Have you thought about the future? Will you smoke, say, in five years from now? You're 18. In 5 years you'll be 23. Maybe you'll have a family. Do you plan to smoke then? I haven't thought about it. If I feel like it, I will. - Does your girlfriend smoke? - Which one of them? Some of them have tried it. - Don't you have a younger child? - A girl, Jenna. My and Tiina's daughter. She's 14. If Jenna wanted to try it... - Would you get weed for her? - Sure. She could try it. Come on in! I'm so sorry I'm late. Hi. I'm Tiina Jarvinen, Joni's mom. I didn't realize you were the biological mother. Leena Heinola. Sit down. So you're not the step-mom? Not that it matters. No, I'm the mom. Tomas is his step-dad. Isn't both their last name Eriksson? He has his dad's last name. Biological dad's. Not "real" dad's. I'm his real dad. Tomas's name is also Eriksson. My first husband happened to have the same last name. Funny coincidence. I mean, whoever had it first... I thought it was funny at first, too... I have to say Tomas is a much better father... Even though he is an Eriksson. Thinking of you naked and horny on the office couch. See you tomorrow. - Where are you going? - I got a work gig. - What kind of a gig? - A wolf gig. - A wolf gig? - Some people from Bulgaria. - Bulgaria? - Or Belgium. Some conference guests and their kids. How come I haven't heard about this? I'm the managing director. You might have if you had spent more time at work. - You're not going anywhere. - Stop looking at me like that. I hate that. It's like you're reading my mind. I know you're lying. And so do you. - Are you high? - "Am I high?" Are you high? I can't even get mad at you any more. If you leave now, don't come back. Fine. - Where the hell are you going? - To Akseli's or Pete's. You think their parents will put up with this shit? Or André's. His mom is never home either. - I'm home! Right now! - Maybe you're a little late! Who do you think you are? I'm not your dad. We both know that. Fuck! Now I'm late! You're gonna pay for my cab? Next week we're going to the country. Tiina and I agreed. No way. It's Akseli's 18th birthday. Every day is someone's 18th birthday. Besides, it's my dad's weekend. You coming? Can you please join me at the table? I can hear you. I have to cook. Jenna will be here any minute and she'll be starving. That's why I want to talk to you before she gets here. She won't starve to death in 15 minutes... Dut our son may die of drugs. I don't know if I can make it. Things are pretty hectic again. You only think about yourself. No, I don't! I think about this family! You never think of anyone but you! Me, me, me! Why not ME? Nobody listens to me! You don't see me or hear me! - I'm having a breakdown. - Why is it always you and never me? Stop it! Fuck, they're screaming again. Huh? Hi! Hi. - I'm starving! - Hi, honey. Fifteen minutes. - Where were you so late? - Band practice. We're negotiating now. I'm canceling this marriage contract. I can't take this! Our marriage is failing. Our marriage isn't working. I'll leave. What? I'll leave and take Jenna with me. You're going nowhere! - You're not running away from this! - You pushed us to this point. - "Me, me, me, me!" - Stop! Don't leave me alone! Fuck you! Don't go! Let me go! Don't leave. Don't leave. Please, don't go. Don't go. If there's a problem, I can leave. Don't go. I didn't go either. Can we talk? I didn't want it to come to this. Well, you know something about me and I know something about you. We're even. I didn't want anything bad for you. I wanted... - I don't know what I wanted. - It doesn't matter anymore. You've taken everything from me. Everything... Sacred. - I understand how you feel. - Really? I wanted something of my own. You're cheating on your husband. You're like everyone else. But you're my mom. If he ever tries to hurt you... Are there any nice girls here...? Uncle Wolfie came to see you. Hi. Come on in. You're late. Women are all the same. They just want me to huff and puff. I don't give a shit. I'll just do what they want. When was I happy? That's a crazy question... When you think about all the shit that's going on. I'm happy when I'm stoned. It makes me feel good. For a little while. Some people drink. I smoke weed. I don't plan to become an addict or start doing heroin or something. I'm happy when women come and go. But to be honest, you get tired of it. It might be nice to wake up next to the same chick twice. Next to someone who knows me a little. I'm happy about my family. It's the only family I have. I just have to get along with them. In the end, everyone's alone. BOYS 17-18 - Pretty nice. - Yeah. When I win the lottery, I'm going to buy one. - You don't even play the lottery. - I'll win when I start. Hey guys, for real. I hate it when piss starts to run down my leg in my long johns. - You're wearing long johns? - No, but you know what I mean. What a lady! You're our female company tonight? - Did it work? - Sure. The sauna is awesome. - How can a chick have feet this big? - Where did you find them? There's a pool and everything. I found these in their lost and found box. Leave me a stub. I'm out. - You don't smoke. - Now I will. - Who's coming then? - I dunno. André, you're smoking! - What are you up to? - We're waiting for Akseli. It's his 18th birthday. Oh gosh, he's already 18? It seems like only yesterday you were just babies. - C'mon. Don't be like that. - Yeah, yeah, I'll go. - You can stay with us if you like. - That would be a little weird. - Okay, bye. - Bye. - I can't stand it! You're all such men! 18! - Oh, go now. - Who was that chick? - His mom! - For real? Look who's coming! Akseli. The birthday boy! - You'll drink all that? - That's the plan. We're going to get so wasted. Let's go in. I'm freezing in this getup. I'd be freezing if I was wearing that. I'm going in the jacuzzi. Finally. - Are you peeing? - A little. Fucking gross. Is that for me? Hi, Grandma. I'm having a sauna night with the guys. Happy birthday to you. When? Akseli, come here... Why are you smirking? Are you stoned? Check him out. He's all smiles. Did you get laid? It's a big thing for him. - It's about more than sex these days. - Sure. - A blonde or brunette? - Brunette. Does she have nice tits? - You're going to see her tonight? - I don't know. Hope so. You're not going to flake out on us, are you? - How's therapy going? - I don't know. They're making me talk about what I'll be doing in five years. What do you say to that? No idea. I haven't even graduated high school yet. Tell them you'll have graduated by then. - What would you say? - I can say I won't be a cab driver. - You're going to be a big nerd. - Me? - An architect. - A nuclear physicist. Pete's going to be a dad by then. A total family man. Two kids, maybe three. Daddy! A super-daddy. Kiira and you hanging out by the fireplace. - Kiira left me. - What? - Why? - She just left me. She was a slut anyway. Your mom's a slut. - What the fuck are you laughing at? - Chill out! - Fucking think! - Calm down! That wasn't funny. Fucking chill out already. Birthday boy. - It was a stupid joke. - Here's the birthday boy. - Are you sick? - Don't barf in here! Are you okay? My dad's dead. He's been dead forever. Now he's dead for real. Grandma just called and said he drowned while fishing. Fucking alkie. I didn't even know him. Maybe I never would have. Now I'll never have the chance. Goddammit. Oh my God. Annika is mine. The one on the left is mine. There are six of them. I want two. I'm so scared.
