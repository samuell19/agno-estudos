''Chung, hang on!'' Hang on! ''Full Throat, lower your voice, the killer is coming.'' I've already lowered my voice! ''Full Throat, l just can't hang on.'' I'll count everything on you! Chung! Chung... Dagger? Invincible Dagger! It hurts! Help! There is a murderer! Help! Why he is still alive? Go after him! You have to peel it first! Why do you act so slowly? Are you ready? It's all right! Wash those dishes and bowls first. There are too many bowls waiting for cleaning! l am going to wash them now. ''Deliver the food first, the customers are waiting!'' l am going to deliver the food now... ''l told you to cut it into pieces, look at you!'' Are you dreaming? Go to hell! How can you mess up like this? You dropped the food on the floor, what's up then? ''He pushed me, so...'' ''So, what'd we do now?'' ''Look, the bowls are broken, what's up?'' You just don't work hard! But you must give me a chance! What's wrong with you? ''You're useless, you just always mess things up.'' You'd better learn to be a waiter. ''No, if l don't work in the kitchen, l can learn nothing.'' Why? What can you learn right here? ''At most, you'll be a chef, that's all!'' No! l wish to be... A famous and outstanding chef! ''Otherwise, l won't stay in that bastard's restaurant and suffer!'' Who is that bastard you just mentioned? ''Boss, l don't mean it!'' ''l mean, you are... that best, that best guy...'' My colleagues are all friendly to me. l work happily every day. ''lf l cut your salary, will you still be happy?'' ''Please don't, boss!'' ''It?s just a good deed for me to keep you working here, kid.'' ''Boss, my dad is seriously sick, he is really sick.'' More than that! He will die soon. Why hasn't he come back yet? He is back! He is home! Why do you come home this late? Your father... Dad! Dad... Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! l am glad that you're still alive! I'm dying! l wish your brother would be around. Don't mention about him. He hasn't come home since you have got sick. l have just forgotten him! But he is still your brother. You have to love each other. Dad... Dad! Dad! Dad! l want to tell you one thing. There is much money in the box under my bed. Take it with you. What money? l planned to marry again with a Mainland girl... What? You want to re-marry at your age? ''She is cute! She's just 20 something, so sexy.'' But l can't make it now. Start some business with your brother. ''lf you two work together, sure you may achieve something.'' Work with my brother? ''Though he doesn't behave, he is a real good cook.'' He makes excellent steamed dumplings. l just want to eat it again! Why didn't you tell me that you're that rich? l just don't have to live a dog's life in Dragon's restaurant. Yes? There is still something inside the box... Dad! Dad... Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Hello? Hello? Is that Rickx? This is Mike. My brother Mike? Has dad just passed away? How do you know that? Did he leave some money to us? What do you want? You didn't call or write home for three years. You just called for money! We have to make good use of the money. l am now in Osaka. ''I?ve got a good idea, a big business.'' Why don't you come here? Guess whether I'd come or not! You know? I?ve suffered much after you left. ''lf you get the money, you'll outspend it for sure!'' l will not go to Japan. Bye! ''Good morning, boss.'' ''Rickx, l bet you've been real busy in these days.'' ''Never mind, l can handle it.'' l forgot to send my congratulations. What? l bet it's not for my father's death! ''l don't mean that, l just mean...'' ''After your father's death, you can be single minded'' ''You care nothing but your work only, right?'' ''You're right, l have to work harder from now on.'' l want to be a great chef. He wants to be a great chef! Can you see it? Can you hear that? He just wants to be a great chef! Why don't you try to be a great handyman? Stupid! Better be a handyman! Clean it now! Got it? Damn it! You're so shameless and naive! ''Damn you, Dragon!'' You... damn it! ''l am sorry, boss...'' ''My mood just swung, please give me a chance!'' ''Damn you, Dragon! l quit now!'' I?ve had enough! l just want to quit now! l must kill you! King of Four! Go after him! Stay! Stay where you are! Help! It hurts! Someone wants to kill me! Here we're now arrived at the Jumbo Seafood Restaurant. It?s gorgeous! You just can't miss the chance of eating fish-balls. Cut ! ''What's wrong with you, Kyoko?'' I?ve eaten for consecutive 6 hours. ''This is a program for gourmets, sure you have to eat.'' Just work hard. You'll have to eat some more sausages later. ''All right, I?ll let you take a rest.'' Let's go there and get everything ready. Okay? Thank you. Let's go. Super Delfin! I?d work hard! Help! I?m sorry! Help! Help... l just think of your good. l am not greed for dad's money. ''You want to be a good chef, right?'' ''Come visit me in Osaka, sure l can help you.'' Excuse me. ''What is this place, please?'' l don't know the place you ask Get out ! ''Bastard, what are you doing here?'' Stupid fool! What a wolf! What a wolf! ''Open up! Pay me back! It?s five hundred thousand, Hong Kong guy!'' Open up! Open the door! Pay me back! l have the back bond. ''Come out! Pay me back, Hong Kong guy, pay me back!'' ''Open up, pay me back!'' It stinks! Pay me back! Five hundred thousand! Hong Kong guy! Brother Mike! ''You trash! Listen! lf you don't come out, I?ll break and enter!'' ''Brother, what happened?'' l am so anxious to see you! It?s quicker to come down like this. How about your friend? He is too anxious to see me too. He is really anxious! There is a short cut! Come on! It?s delicious! Do you think Osaka is similar to Hong Kong? ''I?ve visited so many places in the world,'' No other place attracts me like Osaka does. Thank you! Wait! Please wait! ''Mike, you know much Japanese, huh?'' No! This is Osaka language. ''You speak with your heart in Osaka, they get it or not, doesn't matter.'' ''If you want to say hello, say ''Thank you''.'' ''If you want to say thank you,'' ''Say, ''Thank you, Thank you''.'' Thank you. ''When you want to express your appreciation,'' ''Thank you...'' ''Just repeat it, right?'' More than that! Say it with your heart. Thank you... Thank you... Thank you... Thank you... Thank you... Thank you... ''That's not enough, try to remember one more phrase.'' '' What ? '' what..... What ? Anything would do. It?s the fault of the bus. It?s your fault. ''l said, it's the fault of the bus.'' l think they've just forgotten ''What''. Osaka people just can't live without ''What''. Go over there and remind them with ''What''. Come on. ''l am not in error, it's the fault of the bus.'' It?s your fault. What ? ''No, you have to show some expression on your face.'' What ? It really works! What ? How is the post? What ? ''Mike, why do you bring me here?'' l want to show you something great! Punch him! ''Here comes our hero, Super Delfin!'' What do you think? It?s great! His speed and skills are professional. But... why do you bring me here? This is what l want to spend dad's money with. Beat him... Punch him! What did you say? Beat him! What's up! Do you want an ambush? ''No, Mr. Super Delfin, l adore you so much!'' ''Well, can you come to Hong Kong for performance?'' Please! What did you say? Performance? Do you take me as an artist? l am a professional wrestler! Why should l go to Hong Kong? Go away! Go... Mr. Super Delfin... It has nothing to do with me! Super Delfin is weird. This is so called stylish. You feel different when watching wrestling in Osaka. And even much different when watching a live show. ''They jump here and there,'' The atmosphere is... so exciting and actuating! ''That's right, l want to bring it to Hong Kong.'' You mean wrestling? Osaka wrestling. l want to open a restaurant promoting Osaka wrestling. You start dreaming again! l want the restaurant a fusion of food and wrestling. All waiters are wrestlers. All are great wrestlers. ''In the middle of the restaurant, there will be a stage.'' They watch wrestling and eat. ''When they get more & more excited, they'll be hungrier.'' ''So, they will order more food!'' We will be rich! ''But your friend, Super Delfin doesn't want to help.'' I?ve figured it out already. ''After wearing masks, you and l are wrestlers.'' Do you mean you wish to be a wrestler? ''Not only me, you too.'' You nuts! l just want to be a great chef. ''All right, you'll be a chef also.'' ''Mike, you are a great chef, you know?'' You are as good as dad. Dad was proud of your cooking. l remember that. Can you find a job seriously? Once you had a greenhouse for aloe in Shenzhen. Once you raised ostrich. ''But all failed, dad and l had to clear the mess.'' Don't you remember? Your wife left you for that reason. I?ll make it! May and Danny will come back to me once l get a success. It?s exhausting... ''Mike, where are the gold?'' Right here. Are you kidding me? What's up! What ? Thank you! Why do you pick this place? You want to fool me? ''This is good, it's near the bus stop, locate on a busy street.'' ''That's true, but...'' ''That small shop is no match for us, it'll close soon.'' Thank you... This is not a common restaurant. It?s a restaurant for wrestling. ''So, l hire outstanding staff.'' What the hell are those jerks doing? Drunken boxing... You tell me this is Osaka spirit? What's up! Louis also comes for the interview? Pass! Konishiki? No problem. How are you? ''l am sorry, l am late.'' You are... My name is Cha-Cha-Pong. Cha-Cha-Pong. Yes! ''You response quickly, you'll act as ''Kuishinbo Kamen''.'' Thank you. Get the hell off me! Dai Kam. You act as the ''Ebessan''. Get lost. Louis. Yes. ''From now on, you are ''Steamed Dumpling''.'' ''Yes, Master.'' ''l won't be mean to you, brother.'' You're Super Delfin. How about you? l am the ''Tigers Mask''. ''You bloody fool, where have you been?'' l was in coma and stayed in hospital for days. Buy your own ticket if you want to go home. ''Boss, are you kidding me?'' ''If you are able to come back to Japan,'' ''well, I?ll let you join a training course.'' Forget it if you aren't willing to. There are numerous people who can substitute your place. What'd l do? Oh my bag! ''Wait, that's my bag... Wait!'' Wait... l told you to wait! Super Delfin! ''Oh, my poor Rickx!'' Make it harder. l don't want to play with you! It?s not a game! l am not playing. ''Get up, come on!'' l don't want to play again! ''It?s not a game, l am not playing with you.'' You want to escape? Come back! Stop! Come on! l want power! Go on! Stop going! ''Okay, stop!'' Freeze! Jump down. Why should l? Jump! Super Delfin? You are... It hurts! Finally l see you! Doesn't she recognize me? Who are you looking for? The restaurant is not opened yet. Japanese? Japan! Where...do you Come from? You speak weird Osaka language. Osaka! What? ''That's enough, man!'' ''Osaka, real Osaka people!'' l want to bring the spirit of Osaka wrestling to Hong Kong. Copy their skills. Wrestling? Wrestling! Wait! He is Super Delfin! Super Delfin! ''Super Delfin, you look smart!'' l adore you so much! What did she say? She said you're impolite. Why do you leave once seeing her? ''l am tired, so l just want to take a break.'' l see! He said you're flattering him. But he just can find no match. l love wrestling. ''lf he doesn't mind, shall we have a practice?'' She said you are too mean. You'd at least shake hands and say hello. Go... Rickx! ''Be gentle, please.'' What a trouble! You're nagging! Do it yourself. Get your ass out of here. Why are you still wearing mask? ''Take it off. Clean your face, come on.'' Don't touch me. Are you okay? l am fine! l am really sorry! l thought of being a wrestler before. l couldn't imagine that you're so nice that you didn't fight back. Why does she speak so much in Japanese? What's up? Don't blame her! ''Kyoko is a nice girl, you know?'' l think she intended to hurt me. ''We didn't know each other, but she just kicked me hardly.'' She just told me her poor story. A stranger bumped her into the sea. She thus lost her job. She's got no money to go back to Japan. That guy is... ''lf she meets that guy again,'' She swears that she'd slash him into pieces. That's a bastard! A real bastard! Bastard! Poor girl. ''So, l want to hire her and let her stay here.'' ''We need waitress, anyway.'' What? Super Delfin is my idol. ''When l feel unhappy on work,'' he always encourages me. ''I?ll take you as my benefactor, I?ll take good care of you.'' Okay? Good... She is so nice to you! l envy you so much! Okay? ''Kid, how dare you play in my place?'' Dad? ''Danny, you've improved a lot in kung-fu.'' How is your school life? Let's share something happy. l was punished by my teacher last week. Why? What did you do? We farted during the assembly. Just farting? It?s no big deal! ''You know? When l was in the primary school,'' Once l stooled in the staff room. Really? Sure! Too bad! They identified me at last. They knew that's my stool. It?s ridiculous! How did they know it's mine? Do you know why? They said it's recognizing thick! It?s sick! ''Danny, do you like wrestling?'' Let me show you something! This is my sign. I?ll have a game with other wrestlers later on stage. Can you make it? Sure l can. Will you fart when you fight? ''Sometimes, come watch me in the restaurant.'' But mom doesn't like that idea. She just hasn't told you how she loves it. We haven't seen for a long time. What's up? l just came to chat with my son. ''You lost his custody, remember that?'' ''l am Danny's daddy, anyway.'' Let's go! It?s a bit salty. ''As an outstanding chef, other than controlling the taste,'' the appearance is very important too. ''That means, taste, look and smell.'' This is great! The TV producer promised to interview us. Is that true? ''Tomorrow, they will come for a live show.'' ''Then, we'll be famous!'' ''So, many people will watch me on TV.'' l have to color my nails and do facial first. ''Boss, is that okay?'' Get your ass out of here! Bye! All of you go out for practicing. ''Forget those dishes, go out for practicing!'' What do you mean? Why do you behave like that? ''l spend much effort in this restaurant,'' What you're doing now is just like an outspent. This is a chance! l don't need such chance. ''l am a chef, you are a chef too.'' Can you be honest? Wait! What is it? ''Let him go, he will come back later.'' It?s a bit salty. What's up! Set the legs. Yes. Do you want wide angles? Sure! l am so happy... Having you interviewing our restaurant... It?s our real luck! Wrestling is a very good entertainment. ''Speedy, powerful.'' And skills are important too. That's great! Can we shoot now? ''Yes, look!'' They are so fit! Our restaurant in Hong Kong can be termed as a... A revolutionary creation! Do you think so? ''That's good, can we shoot now?'' Yes. Get it ready. Have some water please. Have some water first. Thank you. Can we shoot now? Yes. Get it ready. Excuse me. Yes. One bottle of beer please. ''Pal, you look pale, are you all right?'' ''l ran a long way, l am just a bit exhausted.'' Have some beer! l think... l just can't make it. Are you all right? I?ll count everything on you then! Are you all right? Is that true? Someone is killed! It?s none of my business! Freeze! Stop! No? Stop chasing me. l won't chase after you if you don't run! l won't go if you don't chase after me. Don't go! Help! ''Sir, are you all right?'' You rolled faster than l ran! You'd better follow me to the police station. Look! Mars! Stop running! Stop running! It?s none of my business! Stay where you are! l saw them coming in. Where are they? Let's go! l haven't failed to arrest any criminals. Follow me to the police station now. l just feel so dizzy! l want to take a rest. Shall we start shooting now? Have some water first. Water please. l have drunk much water! ''Be frank, can we start now?'' Sure! This is popular in Osaka. This one? Beat him... Let's call it a day. ''Wait, you can shoot now.'' Actually we have some powerful stances not showing you. Can we shoot that? Yes! Powerful stance! Give way... Pay attention! Powerful stance! Run for my life... l have got nothing to do with it... It?s not locked! ''Senior, how is it going?'' The suspect went inside. Stop him from ahead. Got you! Why is it so crowded? l think we have to go now. ''Director, you can shoot now, please give me a chance.'' ''This is a problem of shooting, not a problem of chance.'' Let's go. Director... Leaving now? Right. ''You'd better go, damn you fatty!'' But you have to drink some water to quench thirst. Put the lights properly. Why are they still there? Where to go? Super Delfin! You can shoot now! Shoot now? Jump! How can l jump? No way! ''Come on, jump!'' What's up! Roll! Wonderful stance! Fried beef with beans! Wonderful! ''It?s really wonderful, Rickx!'' So great! Bravo! ''Super Delfin, you are really great!'' So what is that ''Wonderful kicks''! Do you think you're great? Damn it! Once l suspected that you're not my blood brother. But now... It proves that we are a great cook's sons. You're the chef. What a shame! l am not that capable at all. Dad always said you cook well. You make excellent steamed dumplings. Why do you pack up? l am not! ''Tomorrow, we can use this thing.'' It?s dad's steam stand! ''When l left, dad gave me that.'' He wanted me to keep it well no matter what happens. It has been following me. But l haven't got a chance to use it. ''l am sorry, Mike,'' l have mistaken you. ''Don't be silly! We are brothers, right?'' You're right. Food is a very important factor to make a restaurant popular. ''But together with my promotion and packaging tactics,'' sure we can make it! ''l wish dad is alive! lf he heard that,'' l bet he was willing to die once again! Where is his saving box? It?s on the 2nd floor. So? l have to save money from now on. For May and Danny! ''lf l get success, they will surely come back to me.'' The restaurant opens tomorrow. Mike's dream will come true. ''Dream, my brother's dream, comes true.'' I?ve got a dream too. But it has been changed. ''However, no problem.'' I?ll be happy since my customers can eat something cooked by me. ''You, dream, superstar?'' No problem! No problem. ''Very fast! Your dream, comes true!'' Superstar! Just work hard! They haven't opened up yet. ''Now, the Osaka Wrestling Restaurant starts its business!'' So pretty! Thank you for coming! How are you? l am fine. How are you? l am fine. How are you? l am fine. How are you? l am fine. May we know the secret of your success? My secret of success is... The spirit of struggling from zero. That's Osaka spirit. This way... How are you? l am fine. How are you? l am fine! ''Miss, come here, 20% discount!'' Come on! It?s great for lovers. 20% discount... Come on! We have great food here! 20% discount! What's wrong? Why no one comes to eat? You just smoke! Damn it! Don't you have to work? You drive me mad! Take care! How are you? l am fine! What ! He is mad! Help... A table for two please. ''l am sorry, the booking is for next week.'' Next week? ''That's right, next week.'' How come? ''Yes, we've got good business!'' l am just not sure that I?d live till next week. Yes... ''Well, l just have to hang on for one more week.'' What are you doing here? Why are you here? l am washing dishes. Thank for your work. Thank for your work. ''Rickx, why are you always wearing this mask?'' ''Well, l am Super Delfin.'' l just can't let others see my face easily. ''Just like those Spiderman, Batman, so and so.'' l am so happy to know you all. Happy? That's great. You know? ''Since you've come, all of us have been so happy.'' l am really happy to know you. ''You speak Japanese again, l just don't understand.'' What ! Nothing... It?s you! l want to date you. Are you nuts? l know it's been my fault. But l am totally different now. l just can't tell the difference. The business in my restaurant is growing. ''l work so hard, you know?'' l hope you can come back to me. l am not interested in your business. l think... I?d disappoint you. l think... l have to tell you something. ''That's right, l know you still love me.'' l will go to Canada with Danny. This is quite a good idea. l have to bring more coats. l am not going with you. ''I?ll marry again, then, we'll go to Canada.'' Stop kidding. At least he is honest. Unlike you! You don't behave well at all. You won't like Canada! ''There is always thick snow in winter, it's taller than you!'' Are you capable to clear the snow alone? You don't have to worry about it. ''Anyway, l am used to take care of myself.'' ''Honey, give me a chance.'' Just give yourself a chance too. ''Let me take care of you and Danny, okay?'' It?s too late. Mom! Mom! Boss. Boss... Boss... Boss... ''Boss, l want to get the rest of my salary, please.'' ''Tony, let me teach you a new dish.'' Delicious! ''Cha-Cha-Pong, it's for table three.'' ''Got it, boss.'' Bravo! Why is there a cockroach? Are you kidding me? Fake teeth? ''l am sorry, I?ll change another one for you.'' No problem! What's the matter? ''Hey, don't go! What's the matter?'' Mike! ''Mike, are you all right?'' He is like trash! My wife gives me up. ''She gives you up, I?ll take you!'' My wife gives me up. Miss... ''Hi, l am representing Tak-shing Production Company,'' May l have a chat with you? Rickx! ''Wait, l haven't put on my underwear...'' A production company wants to hire me. Yes! They want to hire me! How are you? Are you all right? l am fine... l am fine... You say... a production company? They want to hire me! Congratulations! But l rejected. What? l want to stay here. But you always want to be an outstanding actress. Superstar! l don't want to leave you! But this is an invaluable chance! We've got a problem here! l just can't leave now. We are not worth for your sacrifice. Listen to me... ''l am sorry, actually what l did last time...'' l won't listen to you! Kyoko! It?s my fault! Where has Kyoko gone? Look at Mike! Should we close the shop? What should l do? Who is it? Danny? ''Uncle, why do you have to be a chef?'' l always want to be a chef! Is it not tasty at all? ''Danny, why are you here? Where is your mom?'' ''Never mind, I?ll take you to your father.'' How is it? Mom doesn't let me to visit daddy. Nobody here! ''Take care, got it?'' ''Rickx, we have a customer out there.'' He made a reservation last week. ''He is Chow Yan-kei, isn't he?'' ''Mike, we have got a chance!'' ''Chow Yan-kei, the famous gourmet, he is just downstairs.'' ''Get down now, make the best steamed-dumplings for him!'' ''lf he recommends it to the world,'' l am sure everyone wants to come here and try your steamed dumplings. ''Mike, come on!'' ''l feel a hole in my chest,'' wind blows in... Do you want the shop to close? My wife and son won't come back. Let it close! Do you remember what you said before? l said many things! How can l remember them all? Are you crazy? This is the only chance. ''Okay, I?ll do it!'' But l want to tell you one thing. Danny just came. ''He wants me to tell you that, he saw you on TV.'' You're great! He hopes to see you fighting again on stage. ''In Danny's mind, his dad isn't a chicken.'' But a real hero. ''Sir, what do you want to order?'' What is the best in this restaurant? l got it. What's the best in this restaurant? ''Fried eggs, l am good at frying eggs.'' l can make very good toast. ''It?s not for children, you know?'' ''He is a gourmet, you can't trick!'' It?s your fault! You'd ask what he likes most. That's none of my business! It?s your fault! You told me to serve him! Stop arguing! Let's make steamed dumplings. But he ordered the best food in our restaurant. Maybe we don't cook everything well. But we'll do it with our hearts. ''lf he is a real gourmet,'' sure he can taste our sincerity. He may be the last customer of our restaurant. ''l hope he can have steamed dumpling, which is my dad's favorite.'' Just take it as a memory. ''Rickx, don't worry.'' ''Anyway, you have my support.'' Me too. Me too. ''Okay, we'll co-operate,'' to make the best steamed dumplings we can. Thank you! Yes! Not the four of you... But five. Mike? We won't make common steamed dumplings. ''We'll make with a secret recipe, which is from Express Dowager.'' A secret recipe from the Ching Dynasty? Empress Dowager? It?s for making steamed dumplings that Empress Dowager loved most? That's right. ''In the box, there is something...'' It?s from our dad? ''lf you and your brother co-operate, you'll achieve success always.'' ''Rickx, thank you for waking me up.'' ''From now on, we'll work together!'' Brotherhood solves any difficulties. Mike! Rickx! Mike! Rickx! ''Mike, you're back!'' Bravo! Mike! What a trouble! What's next? It seems to be chili. What? Chili for the dumplings? ''l don't know, it's written right here.'' It?s your fault to tip the soy. What? It?s because you pushed me. Stop arguing! The guest is waiting. ''Okay, use chili then.'' My back hurts! l haven't seen Mr. Chow being so energetic for a long time. What's up! Bravo! Here writes... People below 60 will be cautious after eating it. ''Mr. Chow, why do you love eating in this restaurant?'' It?s great! How great it is? Look at me and you can tell it. ''l heard that you're going to join the Marathon, right?'' I?ll go skating tomorrow! Is that true? ''Mike, hurry up, there are so many customers waiting.'' It?s all right. We don't even have time to have a game on stage. You don't have to worry! l wish Kyoko would be here. ''Kyoko, your name in this show is ''The Big Stomach''.'' ''Now, you have to break a new record.'' Finish them all within 30 seconds. Sausage again? It?s done! So what is the ''Super Steamed Dumpling''? I?ll let you try a real powerful one. Thank you. ''Danny, we are now going to meet uncle in Canada.'' Just leave these things here. ''l don't want uncle, l want daddy.'' ''Be good, when we are in Canada,'' Uncle will buy many toys for you. ''l don't need toys, l need Tigers Mask!'' Daddy is Tigers Mask. ''He is different now, don't give him up, please.'' There're already many people queuing up outside now. Let's open it earlier. Yes. Do you need helpers? Don't you want me to help you? What's up! Go and help us now! Yes! Yeah ! Yeah! What are you doing? Take him away! You'll dead meat this time. Who knocked at my head? I?m back. Rickx! Kyoko? Rickx! Where have you been? l miss you so much! I?ll never leave you! ''Promise me, stay with me forever.'' Kyoko! l love you! How is it? Move! Get that disc back now! Thank you... ''Thank you, bye!'' How is it? ''What's the matter, boss?'' How dare you hurt my girl? What's up? Don't move! Are you okay? No problem. No problem? Use your last and wonderful stance! Super Delfin! Power! What? ''Drill him, come on!'' It hurts! That's right! Bingo ! Are you dead? Here comes Tigers Mask! Transform! Shit! ''Dad, charge up!'' Wonder Turn! Watch me! Charge up! Go to hell! Are you all right? No problem! You work so hard! Why am l here? Game over! Give me a bun please. Welcome! This way please. It?s nice to see you again. How are you? Fine! Come and try our tasty food. What? Yeah ! ''From today onwards,'' ''You are now in Osaka,'' Let's exercise your Hong Kong spirit!
