Based on the novel a hell of a woman by Jim Thompson published in serie noire - editions gallimard under the title des cliques et des cloaques Hello, ma'am. Franck poupart, bargain counter. We don't need your rubbish. No, you've got the wrong person. I'm looking for one of my clients, Mr. Tikides. Andreas constantin tikides. I believe he works for you. - He owes you money, right? - Not at all. No, it's rather the opposite. He made one payment too many. Pull the other one, Sonny. - Do you know what that bastard did to me? - No. I hired him to fix my rabbit hutches. I paid him what I owed him, last night, he came back and opened a" the hutches. Seventeen rabbits. Do you hear me? So don't worry, Sonny. I'll tell you where to track the bastard down. At the gym. - Second turning after the railway bridge. - Yes, I know it. And fleece him for me! Thank you. Do you know what you should have put on your hutches? Two or three nice big padlocks. Brass, chrome-plated, Swiss-made, and a one-year guarantee. - All our ironmongery... - Save your sales talk. Just take a look without any obligation. Look at that. For your dressing table, pure synthetic tortoiseshell. I don't have money to burn. Perhaps your daughter would like something? She's my niece. Your niece? She's pretty. I saw her up there. I'd certainly buy some of that! Maybe we could come to some arrangement. - You think so? - Sure. What's money, after all? There are more important things in life. Is there any quilted dressing gown? Quilted dressing gowns? They're our specialty! Made in Austria, pure pyrenean wool. I'm sure to have one of your size in the boot. Wait here a minute. Don't mess about, franky. This is not the moment. Man... Hello. I'm guessing we're in your bedroom. It's simple, charming. A little rustic, maybe. Excuse me, your gown... You've dropped it. I'm sorry. What's your name? Mona. Have you been doing this for long? You shouldn't do this for a quilted dressing gown. It's not right. Especially at your age. How old are you? There are other solutions. Go on. Name any profession you like. - It has to be better than this. - What are we doing? Shall we get on with it? Mona. Do you need help? Do you want to do this? Do you want to or not? Are you being forced to do it? Right. Okay. Don't panic. It's okay. Comprendo. Will you come back? - What? - Will you come back? Hey, she can talk! That's new. What would I want to come back for? Of course, I will. Of course, I'll come back. Does it make me look fat? Not at all. You're as svelte as they come. Overcoats? Do you have any overcoats? Don't push your luck! For next time. Bring me a nice coat for the winter. Mona you may well be a hell of a girl but I'd better steer clear of you maybe I'll never come back Mona, Mona you rotten old cow! You cost me 400 francs! Keep going, why don't you? Of course, it's legal. Would I be doing this if it wasn't all in order? This is a contract for a three-piece suit with deduction from salary in case of non-payment. There, look. Okay. How much does he owe you? - Tikides? - Yes, sir. I hate this kind of nonsense. Never set foot in here again. See your pay here? I'm giving it to this slimeball. Poupart! You son of a bitch! If you'll excuse me, I'll be off. One quilted dressing gown, thank you! Report to base! No way! Not him as well, not tonight! I've had enough. One phone call and all's well. Staplin? Poupart here. Did you find tikidés? No, not yet. But listen to this. Here. One quilted dressing gown, paid in cash. Good, but it would be even better if you found him. Come on, boss. Give me some time, don't be mean. I mean to say, after all, when all's said and done. A little time, okay? Just a little. Let's say tomorrow morning the latest. Good luck, franck. Tikides! My old mate! How's it going? Calm down, calm down! This is not the wild west, it's a civilized country! Fuck this shit! Thief! You're nothing but a thief! Your suit fell apart straight away. Thief! Rapist! Tikides is a rapist! Down with tikides, the rapist! What? Rapist? That's right. Play the innocent! Little Mona, at the old bird's place. Ring any bells? She's a minor! Off to jail, tikides! With your mug, the cops will have a field day. Well, handsome? Robbing cradles, are we? What is it going to be then? Yes or no? What are you doing down there? Lying on the floor? Right where it's most disgusting. Come on. Come on. Are you okay? Are you okay? Here. Are you okay? Here. Here. Go on. Here. I'm sorry about your job. Really. Here, take this. Go on. Come on. Take it. There you go. There's no need to look at me like that! If you ask for it, you get it. But you see... When I let myself go, I can be quite a nice guy. Like a Saint Bernard, open-handed and generous. But I have to do my job. Good evening to you too. As polite as ever, I see. Okay. I can't do it anymore. I clean, but it's still dirty. Nothing works in this dump! The sink is still clogged. It was the same in brive and rue carnot! It's the same everywhere! We've never had a proper house. Only dumps and this is the worst. You turn every house into a dump! You should have seen my mother! She managed with water on the roor, no vacuum cleaner. I'm not your mother! And you're proud of that? Right. Okay. Fine. I know. It'd be easier if I earned a bit more money. At least until you find work. It's not my fault! Jeanne, I'm wrung out, shattered. Be nice. Fix me something to eat. Jeanne? I said I'm sorry, did you hear? Jeanne? Do you hear me? I'm asking you nicely to get me something to eat! Nicely. Do you know what that means? Look at you! Who do you think you are, kiki caron? Is the water nice? You've laddered my last pair of stockings. I got a suitcase full of them! Choose a pair! You know they don't fit me. They're too wide in the heel. I don't care, I'll go like this. Go where? I'm not coming back. You can kiss me if you like. Come on, kids! Yippee! What fun we're having! Would you like something? Yes. Your mouth, baby. Not the hair! Got a light? Get some matches, buddy. There's a shop on the corner. Hi, boss. How is it going? Hello, franck. No. Spare me that, will you? Sorry. Sorry, boss. Here you go. You disappoint me. - Do I? - You disappoint me a lot. In my day, we did it with a minimum of discretion and finesse. “It"? What did I do? The employer... The ex-emponer of Andreas constantin tikides rang yesterday. Just after your phone call. I got the feeling he thought he'd been cheated. Not at all! - I mean, I... not at all... - Don't worry. I told him that you acted in a perfectly legal manner. I didn't tell him it was me you were cheating. Right. Okay. Now we come to the great confession. I borrowed 400 francs. I'll pay it back at the end of the week. And the rest? There is no... Spare me your theatrics. I just had to ask around a bit, at random, to find at least ten discrepancies. - It's this bloody rain. I... - How much, franck? A thousand? Two thousand? - Boss... - Let's call it 1,500. Not even that. Fifteen hundred? Seeing as you're an honest lad, you can pay me back the money and we'll forget it. I may have to write you a cheque. Come on. Shit, staplin. Are you taking the piss? If I could pay you, I wouldn't have taken it. Obviously. I'm sorry, but... I have to press charges against you. But what do you... You're completely crazy! A little spell in jail might knock some sense into you. Who knows? Maybe you'll find a solution. Look, boss. Give me a chance. Give me three weeks. I'll work 16 hours a day. I'll get there. I mean, 1,500 francs isn't the end of the world after all. I tell you, it's for your own good. Marcel? Marcel is a police inspector and a friend. He'll sort you out. I gather you've been dipping your hands into the till? You're the filth? We'll see about that. Got an arrest warrant? He's bright. He's got all the lines. That's good. Get off me. Come on! Come on, pet. Here, kitty, kitty. Gently. Calm down. Come quietly. Come on! There. Nice and calm. I'm in jail. Do you expect me, franck poupart, to stay in here? What do you take me for? Did you hear me? This is not how it's going to be. I'll have the lot of you! Just like that! One phone call and you'll all be sent off to... To whatsit... To timbuktu! Let me out! Let me out! Let me out! Let me out! Let me out! Poupart. Franck! I'm so pleased they let you out so quickly. Quickly? You call that quick? Let go, poupart. Let go. You're hurting me! Let go. Your wife reimbursed me barely an hour ago. She dropped an envelope in earlier. I rang Marcel straight away. I assume it was your wife. She was in too much of a hurry to talk. - Who else would it be? - I don't know. - Didn't you know? - Of course I did. I didn't know she'd get it so soon. A lot of your clients rang this morning about their deliveries. - I explained to them. - Great! Why don't you put an ad in the paper too? What I mean is that your wife didn't call, as far as I know. So? Why would she call you? To find out what was going on. No doubt you rang her from the station. Right. We", see you around then. Don't abandon us, franck. I'm sure that from now on, you'll be highly scrupulous. Here. I'll give you an advance. To start you off on the right foot. Mona? What's going on? What are you doing here? No, I'm alone. Don't be afraid. - Come on. - Shall we go then? Don't talk nonsense! Mona! Come on, it's freezing out here. Come on. Let's go. Did you pay back my boss? Do you have that much money? Did you borrow it? Well, what then? You didn't steal it, I hope. Yes, great! From who? Your aunt? It gets better and better! Why did you do that? And how did you know I owed my boss money? Icalled him. Who? Staplin? Why? Did you want to talk to me? Did you need me? You promised to come back. What happens if your aunt finds out? We have to leave right now. Why me? Why, Mona? Why me? Why did you do that for me? Because I didn't screw you? Mona? No, don't get angry. Please. Okay. That's enough fun for today. I'll take you home. In two weeks, I'll pay you back what you paid to my boss. Then, we'll be quits. No problem. Dammit, Mona, think about it! - Five hundred francs won't go far. - Take the rest then. Is there a lot? Watch out, Mona. Watch out. Let's not get over-excited. Don't panic. What do you mean by a lot? Ten million. Wow! The old miser! I'll take you home. - Do you have any neighbors? - No. Aren't you afraid living alone with her in this neighborhood? We have a gun. And you're telling me now? You really choose your moments! It's too risky. I don't go near firearms. That's enough, Mona! Stop getting on my nerves! Hey. You're driving me mad, running off like that for no reason. Give me till Sunday night. We'll meet tomorrow, Saturday, three o'clock, on the pavement behind your house. Jeanne. Jeanne... Don't leave me all alone! Don't do that. Enough with the dirty stuff! Talk about being on fire! You're like the towering inferno. I'm sorry, Mona. These things happen. Maybe you over-excite me. Make yourself decent. I'll take you home. What do you want now? I'm not clairvoyant, you know! Speak up! Don't leave me to work it out alone! Fine. Give me that back now. Leave me alone, goddammit! I only got one pair of hands! I can't do everything at once! Look, Mona. There's no point in doing this. Give me the key and I'll take you home. Don't start running away again. I've had enough of that too. You think I'm chickening out? Right? Do you want me to write everything down and sign it? I said tomorrow night, it will be tomorrow night. Let me be and don't get on my nerves. Okay? Where is the old woman's gun? In her bedroom. Completely crazy! Get out of here. Come on, son. Get out of it. If you see me, you've had it. Don't turn round. Idiot! He saw me, idiot! Right, he just had to see me! Hey, tikides! Come on. Jump in here. We'll have a party tonight. Okay? You're a really nice guy, poupart. It beats being on the run with the cops on your tail. If they catch you, it's 15 years of statutory rape. Don't start that again. I never raped her. Of course not! She raped you. But it was part of my salary, that's the truth. Cross my heart and hope to die. Jesus, tikides. Are you dumb or something? You bumped off the old bitch's bunnies. She wouldn't pay me the rest. Yes and she swore to get revenge. You see? She told the cops everything. How you threatened them, and forced yourself on the girl. Your word against an old woman's? Forget it. Everyone knows what she makes the girl do. If they arrested everyone who had her, there'd be no-one left on the street. Can you prove it? Any witnesses? Any photos? Did you sign anything? You've had it, dumb-ass! Inside you go, tikides! Okay then. What's wrong with you? Nothing. What's wrong? Is everything okay? Nothing, I'm fine. Leave me alone. I'm sorry. I'll leave you in peace. Don't worry, buddy. Yes, tikides. I know it looks like I've got it all. Suit, house, car, but... I'm so fed up with everything too. My wife left and... And I'm sure to be fired from my job. So you see. We're in the same boat. Dammit! I swear, I really want to Chuck it all in. Franck, let's get drunk together. Do you have any calvados? Scottish calvados, my friend. Scottish whiskey made in scottland. Like velvet for your insides. I, as ever, made the first move. I tried to calm her down, took her in my arms. And then, she contrived to fall backward into the bath, fully clothed. Deliberately, dammit! You kidding me. Deliberately. Just to get me riled. So I helped her get out of the bath. I started to rub her down, said I'm sorry about her dress. I'll buy her another, that's all. And then... And then... I was nice to her. But she left all the same. After messing up all my things. My god. Whenever I think about it, I want to qubber. I can't bear it. Ican1. I need a woman. Right, women. What if! Had the old woman's girl? I'm useless without a woman. I want that girl. Right now. I'm going. Wait. No. -Stop! - I want her! - Stop, no. Hey, franck. Take a cold bath and calm yourself down. I'll make you coffee. My god. I haven't heard that song in a long time. Who sang that? Was it Gilbert bécaud? - You think? - Yes. - Wasn't it the Stephen sisters? - The Stephen sisters. That's a good one! Why not the Peter sisters? Watch out. I don't know where we're going, but when you've got to go... You piss me off, tikides! You've really done it, man! What a shitty Sunday! Here we are getting drunk like two old women. We're worth more than that. Hey! Tikiki? Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Stay with us. Don't go! Hey? Wake up! What's up? - What's wrong? - Listen. If we go to the old woman's place quietly, maybe we could have some fun with the girl. Don't start that again! I told you. I need a girl, man. I'm useless without a woman. Forget it. It's easy for you to say that. You've already had her. Was it worth it? Was it? - Was it worth it? - A real party. Yes, only I'm not getting any! Why shouldn't I? Look, tikiki. We go there, screw the girl, smash up the house, then run. The old cow, I'd love to! Okay, let's pile in there! Hey, let's go! No, wait. Listen, we're as drunk as a pair of dead fish. I'll make some more coffee, and we'll talk about it. Get out. Feeling better? Come on! Let's go. I've thought about it. There are too many risks. I'm out. Okay. You're scared, so get lost. I'm going. No, franck. It's too dangerous! It's too dangerous! You're right, it's no job for little girls. But franck... Don't worry, I'll manage on my own. Okay, I'll come with you. Go and get stuffed with your Greek pals, okay? Asshole without cheeks. Franck, take me with you! No way! Take your filthy hands off my car. You numbskull! How many more times? - Franck, don't leave me alone. - Can't you see it's a setup? I've been trying to get you there for two days! Drive! Watch out, old woman! Come on. Listen, shit-for-brains, I will say this only once. It's not the old woman who's out to get you, it's me. Franck poupart, franky, to his friends. The old cow's loaded. So I fully intend to bump her off and let you take the blame. Great! That's the kind of plan I like. Stop laughing, you imbecile! - I'm telling you the truth. - Let's go. Skirmish formation. You'll see, the girl is worth it. Come on, drive. The day when the rains come Franck, I'd like to ask you. Look, if you want to come along, keep it shut! Right, I'll go in first. Wait for my call. It's just a small thing. Whatever you do, stay here. The day when the rain comes Got my overcoat, Sonny? Did you leave it in the car? We", don't stand there like a lemon. What are you waiting for? Go and get it! Go on. Hurry up! The girl's in bed. I'll slip into the coat while you slip into her. Wait. Mona, wait! Wait! Not now, Mona! Where's her gun? Where's her revolver, Mona? Where's her revolver, Mona? It's locked! Mona, it's locked! Mona? Mona... Where's the key? The key! Where does she keep the... Come on, quick! Get a bloody move! Never mind. Go and get the money. Go and get the money! Such a dumb-ass. Now that's what I call a shooter. A 45. Loaded too. Tikides? Tikides? It's okay, you can come in. Not so loud, franck. I don't believe it. I really don't believe it! This is completely crazy. - Franck, are you there? - Hold on. The old woman's upstairs. She may come down. Don't move! Can I see the girl now? For god's sake, shut up! - Franck... - What now? It's a bit silly, but something's been bugging me. The words at the end of the song. When we were singing, “la, la, la.“ What are the words? Is that what you wanted to know? Tikides? Can you turn the light on? What for? Turn the light on! - Where is it? - On the left, there. Tikides? I remember the words now. The end is, “you and I will be the happiest, the richest people in the world.“ Stop it! It was that or nothing! Do you think we had a choice? He raped you, didn't he? Didn't he rape you? He was a scumbag! What a fuckup! Come on, Mona. Liven up a bit, help me. Come on! It gets better and better. I really need a holiday. In 15 minutes, you call the cops. You were woken in the middle of the night. You heard a hell of a racket, gunshots. You found the big Greek there, bumped off and your aunt bashed up. Okay? We wait a couple of weeks for things to calm down, then we're off! Istanbul and constantinople, here we come. Just the two of us. The bargain counter presents... Franck poupart! Franky to his friends... In the best deal of the year, 100,000 francs tax-free. Somebody waxed the roor! If I put it in the usual place, it'll get nicked. I have to find a hiding place. Against the wind and the tide, bloodied by battle, but never beaten. Hello, franky. What are you doing here? - I still have my key. - So what? If you have a stamp, do you have to send a letter? Buy a phone, make a call, get a gun and shoot everything! Please, it's hard enough. It's hard for you? You think it's easy for me? What about this? Did this make my life easier? And now... And now, the highlight of our show! Et voila'! The tutu suit! Suave and virile, - completely hand-made... - I'm sorry. Women are fighting over them. Stop it, franck. Please. I need to talk to you, listen! “Listen, listen!“ I'm sick of listening to others' talk. - But you will listen to me. - No more. I won't listen anymore. Go on then. I'm listening. Go on, talk. Shit, Jeanne! Don't just stand there. You'll take root. Come on. Come and sit down. Not so far, sit next to me. Next to me. - You really want me next to you? - Well... Of course, obviously. Okay. - Here I am. - Yes. There you are! Do you want to know where I went? I don't know. To your mother's? I went to a hotel. In Paris, in the 14th. I needed to think. Somewhere quiet. Especially now. What? What is it? Franck, I am entirely responsible. But at least I knew what I was doing. Look, darling. Let's not start blaming each other for what we've done. But since you brought the question up. What do you mean by that? “At least I knew what I was doing“? Don't take it like that. I... You think I'm crazy, is that it? You think I'm off my rocker! Franck poupart, completely schizo! Is that it? Is that what you think in your little head? Good god, Jeanne! Shit! With all the bad luck I've had, now you want me to walk around with a funnel on my head! If it's not one thing, it's another! They get up in the night just to piss me off! Admit that, at least. Admit I've never had any luck. Like a lot of others. Like a lot of others? Shit! Name me one guy who's been unlucky as me. Just one. I'm back now. Everything will be okay, you'll see. Croissants! The paper! Just like old times! Notice anything? Dressed, combed hair, makeup on at eight in the morning. You look magnificent! Baby, you look superb. Are you coming straight home tonight? Of course. Why? Just asking. So I can have dinner ready. - Go, you'll be late. - Rig ht. Another tragedy involving a senior citizen old woman kills assailant then dies on stairs Well done, Mona! We fooled them! We'll fool them again! You, my little Mona you, my little Mona my little wisp of tra-la-ia poor girl! What am I going to do with her? Tarts like that just piss you off all daylong. Look how she jumped on me yesterday. They're all the same! There's nothing to choose between them. Excetheanne doesn't suck cocks in urinals. To work. That's my day finished! Down with the slavery of work! One canteen of cutlery, two chip fryers, and three casseroles, all paid in cash. What's with your clients? Are they all opening restaurants? I'm in great form, boss. That's all! Did you hear about what happened to the old woman and the Greek? Yes, I read it in the paper. - Weren't they your clients? - Yes. They were. It's a shame it doesn't happen more often. If only they all died one after the other. If all our clients died violently, people would start to talk. No, but... Didn't something strike you as odd? - Not really, no. - You didn't read it properly. The old woman lived in poverty. Last week, she bought a quilted dressing gown off you for 375 francs. - So what? - So what? Doesn't that seem odd to you? Look, boss. I'll tell you something. I'm not paid to psycho... shit! To psychoanalyze your clients, tramps, and low-lives that they are! They're all soft in the head or they'd never buy your crap. So no, a" that interests me is my 33%. End of story. With this, goodnight. Bravo. Spoken like a true salesman. Goodnight. Franck? What now? You're a bit on edge. Did I say something to offend you? I'm tired, staplin. I'm fed up, sick and tired, worn out. - You have regrets. - What? Regrets. You feel responsible. Didn't the old woman tell you where he was? He must have found out and taken his revenge. All's well that ends well. They bumped each other off. You have a heart of stone, franck. Go on. Go on! No, he knows nothing. He just likes needling me, that's all. Come on, my lad. Let's go home. No, franky. No! I saw the money when you put it in the suitcase. There's too much. What have you done, franck? No way, franck! Not that! Not now! Don't cry, Jeanne. Please. I don't want you to cry. Don't cry! I'm begging you! Stop it! I wanted to tell you about the money, but I wasn't sure I was going to keep it. I didn't want to give you hope. Anyway... Stop. I'm begging you, stop. - Stop lying to me. - I'm not lying, Jeanne! I'm incapable of lying to you, you know that! I know it's incredible, but I found it. It's the truth. I found it on Friday night at the home of a client who had absconded. I found it in his apartment. Why did you go in? I went in... just because! - I was looking for clues. - What clues? If you let me get a word in, I'll explain. Go on then. Explain. I'm listening. A clue as to where he'd gone. A phone number and address on an envelope. So I searched the apartment. Nothing. Nothing at all. Something was fishy, as if... It's as if someone had made sure to leave no trace. So I got curious. I carried on. Eventually, in a cupboard... You could have knocked me down with a feather. What did you say his name was? Estil. Robert estil. I'll get his file. No, never mind. Come on! At your service, ma'am. - How much is there? - I don't know. Not exactly. Around 20,000 or 30,000 francs. Maybe more. It must be stolen. There you go! There you go, straight away! Why must it be stolen money? Take it to the police. So they can beat me up until they make me confess I did it? No, thanks! You know the cops. They like to keep things simple. - But if you're giving it back... - But that's just it! They'll have a ready culprit! They won't even listen to me. Firstly... It does seem incredible. It's exactly the kind of story that no one ever believes. Especially when it's true. Besides, even you don't believe me. Yes, I do. You say that, but... You know what? I'd understand if you didn't believe me. Jeanne. You and I, we've never had much luck between the two of us. We may as we" face up to it. We could start over from scratch, on the right foot. At least we could try. We could even... You know. - Know what? - You know. I'm not against making some little pouparts if we can raise them right. Franck poupart Jr. You're so nice sometimes, you know. Niece of murdered old woman taken into care what the hell's going on now? Calm down! There's no reason to get worked up. They'd have trouble getting her to talk. Mona's no chatterbox. You're scared though, aren't you? You've got the heebie-jeebies by god! I mean... Five minutes questioning her and she'll drop you in it! I'm even talking to myself now! Better and better! Better and better, franck. Carry on like this and you'll have my job. - Is everything else okay? - Of course. I'm glad! What's got into you, staplin? Nothing's got into me. But I'm keeping you from going home. You must be tired after such a long day. Go home. Now we've had it! I'm sure the cops are following you. I can't believe you came to the shop! We agreed, didn't we? We'd wait a few days before meeting up! That's right, kid. Get lost, that's right. Go and get screwed by the cops, bitch! Perfect! This way, I get to keep the lot. You won't see a penny of it. Not a penny, you hear? You don't care about money, anyway! You're out of it! Why don't you care about it? You're a little whore, after all! It was because of the money you came to find me. That's what you wanted, right? It excites you. Say it! Say that's the only thing that excites you! It's not me, that's for sure! What do you give a damn about an asshole like me? Asshole! Stupid asshole! Stupid asshole! Mona... Why? Why me? I love you, Mona. I love you so much. I've never loved anyone as much as I love you. - What's wrong? - I want to stay with you. Of course you do. That's all we needed. Right. Right. Furthermore... If that's how it is, we're leaving right now. Come on! Let's go! Mona, I have to stop by my place for the cash. I'll drop you at the cinema, okay? - No. - What do you mean, no? You can't come along! It's too risky. There are limits, after all. Yes, Jeanne? I'll be back in a minute. - Franck? - Yes! I'm coming! If I can't even take a dump in peace, well... I mean... Franck, that's enough! What's the hurry, dammit? Where's the fire? I have to know. Stop lying. Where did you get it? I told you, my love. I've eprained a hundred times. You're lying. Where were you on Sunday? What happened? You didn't tell me the truth. Jeanne. Is that a reason to accuse me of lying? You were here all day Sunday, drinking with another guy. Then you went out and returned with the money. What did you do, franck? What did you do? Nothing, Jeanne. I played cards with some friends. Then I took them all home, dammit! Something else happened, something serious. You have to believe me, Jeanne. You have to. I'm not lying. I'm protecting you. Why did you come back on a Sunday with all that money? You're tired, Jeanne. Go back to bed. That story in Monday's paper. What do you have to do with that? What story? You know everyone's talking about it. The murder of an old woman. Leave me alone, Jeanne, please. I want to know. I have to know. What's wrong with you? I've done nothing to you. - Why are you laying into me? - I'm your wife! Don't ask me anymore, Jeanne. I'm begging you. The money was my reward for saving someone, if you must know. Where were you on Sunday night? Shut up, Jeanne! Can't you see I'm trying to save you too? What happened on Sunday night? For god's sake, leave me alone! Go on. Go on. Say what you think of me. Go on. Spit it out. Spill out all your horrible thoughts about how I killed the old woman by punching her, then killed the other guy with a revolver. Is that it? Do you realize what you're saying? Would I have done that? Don't kill me. I'm pregnant. No, please don't. Don't. Don't scream, Jeanne. Whatever you do, don't scream. You're not going to call outsiders against your own husband, are you? You wouldn't, Jeanne. You wouldn't do that. No, Jeanne, my love. No, Jeanne, my love. You wouldn't do that. You couldn't... You couldn't do that, could you? You wouldn't. Everything's okay now. You'll see. Well, what? Why are you looking at me like that? It's okay, Jeanne. I'll get it! Hello, franck. You don't seem very pleased to see me, Mr. Poupart. Aren't you going to ask me to sit down? It's very stylish here. Real Louis xv stuff. I want it all, franck. Everything you've stashed. Thanks to two murders. Two of the stupidest murders ever seen. I admit I don't entirely understand what got into you. I don't want to know. But to get mixed up in that, there must have been a nice big wad. The old woman was a miser. No, that's not it. It was a love story. An amazing love story. Love of money. Otherwise, how come since that night, you've made a mint without seeing one client? Enough. I want the money. There is none. Not a lot. She had saved a lot less than I... I hid it somewhere far away. - We can go and look for it. - Sure. But I'd like to warn you. I left a letter with a friend. If I don't get to him by midnight, he'll take it to the police. Yes, franck. That's how all this will end. So give me the money now. Right now. Watch out, franck. I'm not all that strong. Hit me. Hit me if you like, each to his own. But don't forget the letter. Where's the money? Fantastic. I'd like to offer you a cut, but... I know you'd refuse. - Please, staplin. - No. Leave me a little bit. -Please. Don't talk rubbish. - Just a little bit, 2,000 francs. - No. - Just 2,000 francs, to try my luck. Okay? - No. - I'm entitled. I did it all. - No. No, it wouldn't be right. But I will give you a piece of advice. Don't believe your problems can be solved with money, honey. - Come on! - No! Just a couple of notes. Come on! It's not that I'm bored, but my cheeks are burning. Goodbye, franck. Goodbye. I forgot your girlfriend is here. Bring her in. She'll catch a cold out in the street. You look so alone. Come on! Come on, Mona. This is our big day. We'll party by moonlight, under the coconut trees. Everything's fine. I've got the money. A suitcase full. Everything's fine, Mona. There's nothing to be afraid of. Right? Mona. Tell me there's nothing to be afraid of. Tell me, Mona. Tell me there's nothing to be afraid of. Tell me there's nothing more to be afraid of. Go on, Mona. There's nothing to be afraid of. Tell me there's nothing to be afraid of now. There's nothing to be afraid of now! There's nothing to be afraid of, Mona! There's nothing more to be afraid of! Subtitle translation by Geoff rowlands
