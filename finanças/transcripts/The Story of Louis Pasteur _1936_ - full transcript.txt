Justin, your carriage is waiting. All right, all right. One moment. Dr. Francois Yes? Might? No, justice! In what way did he wrong you? He killed my wife! With his very hands. He gave her fever. Childbed fever. But you can't blame a doctor for that. Yes. Read this. Louis Pasteur. Now who is he? He is a menace to science The shooting of Dr. Francois proves it. Now, monsieurs If Pasteur is allowed to continue He will make the practice of medicine unsafe for us physicians and surgeons of France. You have all read the pamphlet. Louis Pasteur He isn't even a doctor, sire. He's a mere chemist. A chemist You don't say. You remember a few years ago he was the cause of a slight controversy on the subject of sour wine. Oh yes. I recall. He claimed to have found little animals in it Infinitesimal beasts. But are there such creatures? Do they really exist? Your majesty, microscopic organisms have long been observed. They spring into being of their own accord. Wherever there is putrid matter or fermentation. They are the result rather than the cause of disease. By heating wine to certain temperatures, M. Pasteur was able to destroy them. I presume he plans to cure blood poisoning in the same manner. Namely by boiling our blood. Heaven forbid. It's not unlikely I assure you. But I won't have it, Charbonnet. I won't tolerate such practices. We're not living in the middle ages. This is France. Paris. The nineteenth century. I think M. Pasteur should be allowed to defend himself. But, your majesty... I too have read the pamphlets, Dr. Charbonnet They said nothing about boiling blood. Merely to boil the instruments that you surgeons use. Your majesty, if I did anything so absurd as to boil my instruments or scrub my hands they'd think I was a witchdoctor resorting to charms and laugh me out of the hospital. That would be a novelty, monsieur. Most people who go to hospitals are carried out. dead Yes, Charbonnet Why? Because our criminal disregard of germs and their power to invade the bloodstream is causing a death rate in childbirth alone of three out of every ten mothers. Or in the city of Paris so that twenty thousand innocent and helpless women annually This being the case, gentlemen, I leave it to you to decide. which of us should be called murderer. I know what they'll say to that. "Give us proof." proof As if the dead and dying weren't proof enough for their stupidity. But, Louis You can't be sure. You haven't found the germs. Roux? Yes How about those slides. Do they show anything? Fifty eight tests. All negative. -And yours. -Here's one. With a few short chains. Let me see it. According to Semmelweis There has never been a case of childbed fever unless the doctor or midwife had been in recent contact with another victim of the disease. What luck. Nothing definite Try again Again? Yes, again, again and again Remember our aim. Find the microbe. Kill the microbe. Mother? Yes, Annette? There's someone at the door. -Who is it? -I don't know. I didn't look. Service of his majesty the emperor of France A letter for M. Pasteur. He isn't here, monsieur. No? Then who is that? M. Pasteur. "invitation to the palace" The emperor. If I could only convince him. No, no, no, thank you. Now, Annette, we must hurry and get the surprise ready. -Can I help? -We'll all help, darling. This isn't the palace. Excuse me stopping, monsieur. One moment. My wife is very sick. The doctor warned me. Louise! You could have done nothing, doctor. She's been in a coma for two days. -Childbed fever? -No doubt. A pity. It was an act of providence. Providence No, ignorance. You are going to another confinement? Yes, monsieur. The Countess Devilleveau for Dr. Charbonnet. Please, use a clean one. Charbonnet! Charbonnet Your majesty I have a surprise for you. Who do you think is here? I am most curious, your majesty. Who? Pasteur. Pasteur? -Here at the palace? -Yes I sent for him. The emperor has never seen a germ. He's very skeptical. If he will honor me by looking at these slides... M. Pasteur You are wanted. I wonder how you handle this apparatus. The empress Let me see. Oh, well Come come, Pasteur, tell us precisely what you mean. Sire The hospitals of Paris are pest houses. There's scarcely a doctor in the city who's not carrying death on his hands and instruments. Because of microbes, monsieur? Your private menagerie of invisible beasts? Exactly. Dr. Charbonnet could see them for himself. If he took the trouble to use his microscope. He could watch them multiply into murderous millions. They breed in filth. They may start from the gutters of Paris tonight and by tomorrow claim some mother from this very court. Preposterous! To think that a human being could be destroyed by an animal ten thousand times smaller than a flea. It's as though an army of ants were to overthrow your majesty's empire. Monsieur A young woman the wife of one of the court servants died here this evening. A victim of your bigotry. You dare accuse me of murder? But that isn't the end. The midwife who attended her will carry the infection to your next and more illustrious patient Countess Gabrielle Devilleveau Stop! You should know better, monsieur. The Countess Gabrielle is her majesty's sister. I forbid any more. Oh, M. Pasteur, it's most fascinating If you please, my dear. Your majesty, I... Is it not true that you are the author of a pamphlet which caused the death of a noted physician? And also that you practice medicine of a kind? I don't practice medicine. I'm trying to put a stop to the negligence of those who do. Pasteur In the preservation of wine and beer you have been of service to France. We appreciate it. In the future you will confine your work to that field. It is my wish, nay, my command. And if you have any more theories to offer you will first present them in writing to the Academy of Medicine. which is the proper guardian of our national health. Sire What about the pamphlet he's already written? As for that pamphlet, monsieur You will publish an immediate retraction or suffer my displeasure. Permit me, monsieur. I'm Jean Martel, physician and surgeon. Graduate of the Institute Frances doctor of medicine from Le Sorbonne Secretary of Hygiene, member of the International Association of Doctors at Edinburgh Personally, I'm convinced there is some truth in what you say You honor me. Charbonnet is a fool when it comes to anything new or the least bit... I beg your pardon. Aren't you Dr. Charbonnet's assistant? Yes I suppose I am. It's your duty to respect him then. Not to ridicule him. I, monsieur? Good night. He's coming! -He's coming. -Light the candles -Light the candles quickly -Light the candles Stop that. Marie You have to pack. We're leaving Paris tomorrow. You all are aware of the conditions upon which Bismark has consented to withdraw the German armies from France In addition to forfeiting Alsace-Lorraine we must pay an immediate indemnity of five billion francs The question is how are we to raise such a sum? Your excellency Our industries are at a standstill. Farms are being neglected. A devastating plague destroys our cattle at a cost of millions of francs annually This being the case my efforts to raise money have failed everywhere except in one small province. the district of Arbois But if Arbois can pay why not the others? For some reason they haven't been affected by the plague Is that true, Dr. Radisse? I don't know, your excellency. If there is no disease in the cattle of Arbois it is our duty to learn why. Perhaps they've found some means of preventing it. Your excellency, every farmer has a so called cure for anthrax The Academy of Science has listened to thousands How do you account for this phenomenon? Sometimes it happens a few would be immune. Arbois, it seems is particularly fortunate. That is only guesswork, Dr. Radisse. I suggest that you make a thorough investigation immediately. France is in desperate need. Her resources must be tapped to the limit. Every animal that you can save for slaughter will buy back some Frenchman's liberty and self respect They really don't look sick. Luck, that's all, pure luck. Let's ask that boy a few questions. Come on, come please. Hello there, young man. hello Have any of your animals died of anthrax lately? Anthrax? What's that? You know. The Black Plague. Oh, Black Plague. They used to but not any more. Just as I thought. These fields have become immune. But how, doctor? Why? My dear friend, that question is beyond the scope of science. When you ask me how or why, I must refer you to the theologian. When the sheep were sick did your master do anything to help them? He couldn't do much for the sick ones. But there's a man who does something for the others. And they stay well. Like these here. What man? See that house over there by the bridge? -Yes? -He lives there I beg your pardon. I'm Jean Martel. This is Dr. Radisse. Chairman of the agricultural board of the new republic. Well Oh, visitors. See here. What is this nonsense? Monsieur? What do you think you're doing to those sheep? Vaccinating them against the anthrax bacillus. -The what? -The microbe, monsieur. The germ that causes anthrax. Do you hear that, Martel? The germ. We were sent to Arbois to discover, if possible, why your sheep escaped the plague. You're quite welcome, monsieur. My name is Annette. Annette Pasteur. You. You mean... I'm quite sure Father would be delighted to see you. Not Louis Pasteur. That, that chemist? Father Louis Now where are you going? Didn't you promise me to rest? I'll be right back, dear. Be right back. So you are now the saviour of the sheep, monsieur? Very interesting He's the man who was responsible for the death of Dr. Francois Remember? He was run out of Paris. Not quite, doctor. Don't deny it. You were. And you were warned not to practice. Positively forbidden. A prophet is never without followers it seems. But rarely such intelligent ones. These animals know what's good for them. Perhaps you will tell me what's good for them. I'd like to know too. I'm afraid it's hopeless but I'll try. Roux? Yes? Will you try and explain to Dr. Radisse what we're doing? He's a member of the Academy of Medicine. So you'll have to use very simple language. We're convinced, doctor, after eight years of experimenting that this vaccine when injected into the animal will set up an immunity. Ridiculous. It would take eighty years to convince me. Eighty? Aren't you a little optimistic? You're wasting your money. But I don't pay. It's free. Bah! Come along, Martel. I've heard enough. Are you coming? No. I'm going to stay. Drive on. Still disobeying your superiors, eh? I didn't think you remembered me, monsieur. I remember you indeed. The night at the palace when I told the emperor Countess Devilleveau would die. You were right. She did die. And Charbonnet has never forgiven you. May I ask why you want to stay? I'm no longer an idle courtier, monsieur. I work for the government. My job is to help the farmers of France. So So if you don't mind... -Annette -Yes, Father? Ask your mother if we have room for a guest. Oh, I'm quite sure we have. I mean I'll go find out. So you want to render your country a real service, is that it? Why, yes I do. Good. Come with me. This should be of interest to you. I have here the complete life history of the anthrax bacillus in a form even the layman can understand. For example, this slide reveals a number of dormant germs or spores, as we call them which are found in the grass and soil wherever diseased animals have been buried. In this state the germ hibernates, so to speak the way a caterpillar does in a cocoon. And they remain inanimate for years. But the moment these germs find themselves in a favorable medium such as the warm blood of a sheep they immediately change form and grow into long rods. Like this. Amazing! Let us now look at the blood of a healthy animal. Before any germs have entered it. Those are living blood cells as we find them in a normal healthy sheep. How do the spores get into the bloodstream? They're swallowed with the grass that the creature eats. But soon we find that the spores have changed into fully developed germs. Deadly and prolific. Here we have the blood of a sick animal. This time with the anthrax bacillus present. Note the rods that occur among the cells Those are the culprits we're fighting. At this stage, the animal is doomed to die. Once it is buried, however, the germs cease to be active and become spores again. As time goes on they're liberated into the soil. to be blown about in the dust and pollute the grass. Hence the continued recurrence of the plague. And you say these spores are present even here? In the pastures at Arbois? Every acre of ground that I've tested. The only reason our cattle stay healthy is because of my vaccine. For an animal that hasn't been vaccinated Arbois is one of the worst areas in all of France. Where are they taking these sheep? I don't know. Boncourt, find out where they're going. What's that? Look Radisse is responsible for this. Government field. Government field. -That stupidity is inexcusable. -We must stop them Stop! Stop them! Stop them! Stop! Stop them! We're not letting the sick ones through. Only the healthy ones. They'll die I tell you. The fields aren't safe. They're raging with contagion. As a representative of the government I've inspected these fields and they're safe. But that's so wrong. It's been proven that they're not. -stop them -come on, come on. stand back. Isn't there anyone we can appeal to? I've seen with my own eyes what Pasteur can do. And has done for the sheep and cattle of Arbois. We on the other hand, members of the Academy of Medicine, have contributed nothing in the fight against anthrax. Then why in heaven's name don't we listen to a man who has? Pasteur was discovered to be a charlatan ten years ago when he made ludicrous claims concerning the cause of childbed fever. Claims that he was never able to prove. Consequently I see no reason for humoring him further. I disagree. If someone has a cure for anthrax I want to know about it. So do I. Will the visitors in the gallery please keep quiet. -Dr. Radisse -Thank you. There is just one question I want to raise. And that is this. Whether Dr. Martel's purpose here is to further the cause of science or the cause of love. Personally I am of the latter opinion. For having met M. Pasteur's amiable daughter I can hardly blame our young collegue for wishing to become his son-in-law. I protest, Mr. Chairman. I'm here because I think Pasteur is right. I know he's right. And he will doubtless reward you for your splendid efforts on his behalf. Dr. Rossignol Friends, collegues, I should like to propose an experiment that will rid us once and for all of this medical mountebank, Louis Pasteur. In my laboratory I found that I can produce anthrax in healthy sheep by injecting into them the dark poisonous blood of an animal already affected with the disease. This treatment invariably results in death. Let us take fifty normal healthy sheep twenty five of which will be vaccinated by M. Pasteur the other twenty five will remain as they are. I shall then infect all fifty sheep with anthrax by the method I've just explained. And i defy any man or any vaccine to save one of them. -Splendid! -Nonsense! Pasteur would be a fool to try it. He wouldn't dare. Dr. Martel Well, I... I can't take it upon myself. Well, if this treatment is all that you say it is -Yes, let him prove it, let him prove it -I dare him to try it. I accept. M. Pasteur Thank you. -Dr. Rossignol -One moment, please. Just Dr. Rossignol, please. This is the last one. If you wait for me, I'll go home with you Don't you have to stay here? Oh no. No, that's against the rules of the experiment. Then Father can go home with us too? yes Having treated these twenty five animals with your magic vaccine your contention is that they are now immune? correct And I am at liberty to inject into them the blood of an animal that has died of anthrax? If you insist, doctor. But it's a very clumsy way of introducing the disease. Much simpler if you use the germ instead. Who said anything about germs? Well, what do you think causes anthrax? Anthrax is generated within the body. It does not come from an outside source Well, why inject anything? -Why not let it generate? -Monsieur Are you going to abide by the rules of this experiment? Or would you rather admit your defeat here and now? Proceed, doctor. By all means, proceed. -It merely occurred to me -Too many things occur to you. That's your trouble. We're ready, doctors. Oh. Go ahead. I say, M. Pasteur would you care to make a statement to the London Times? The sheep that have not been treated by me will die of anthrax within forty eight hours. The others won't even be ill, I suppose. At least let us hope they won't. For the sake of France. To the end of microbes. And their high priest, Louis Pasteur. Try not to worry, Louis I should have stayed. I shouldn't have left them. Who's there? Besides Dr. Rossignol said it was against the rules. Rules. what nonsense. Louis You realize what this means? Tomorrow if you're successful, every farmer in Europe will want your vaccine You won't have a moment's peace day or night. The benefits of science are not for scientists, Marie. They're for humanity. Our opponents are on their way. Well, Rossignol or Pasteur. Which is it going to be? I say Rossignol. He's a member of the academy. I say M. Pasteur will win. Please, one moment. Well, they're having quite a crowd. It's amazing. People have come from all over Europe To see the acrobats or the Punch and Judy show? These rural entertainers are like fleas the slightest crowd attracts them. Thank you, monsieur. Dr. Lister, one moment, please. Lister? Well, well. Dr. Lister from England? The press would appreciate a statement Lister. How extraordinary. What brings you here? The same reason that brings you, my friends. How do you do. Please -I'm sorry. After you. -No, after you. -After you. -No, after you. -Dead. -Yes. -Pasteur was right. -So far. Now let's see the ones he treated. Well, they won't die, eh? You couldn't convince me. They're all alive and healthy. As you predicted. Roux Roux My faithful friend. Let me shake your hand. Father, Father, I'm so happy. And I'm so proud, dear. Annette Jean, isn't this wonderful? At last, monsieur, a triumph! For you too, my boy. Congratulations. Father? Jean has something to ask you. Well, let him ask. M. Pasteur, what I wanted to say was Yes? M. Pasteur Since my arrival at Arbois I have come to know you and your family quite well. And M. Pasteur... Yes, well, well? Well, I feel... Father? Jean is trying to ask you for my hand. Yes, we want to be married. Well, I should hope so. Congratulations It doesn't seem possible. How can they be alive? I can't understand it either. It's very easy to understand. Pasteur was right and we were wrong. His vaccine does prevent anthrax. We have a great man in our midst. A great man. I quite agree. I forsee marvelous benefits for the world. Especially in the field of surgery. Why not tell Pasteur yourself, Dr. Lister? I'd be delighted to. I want to meet him. Oh, here he is now. Pardon me. Excuse me. Look at those eyes sparkling with health. M. Pasteur If I've been skeptical, I I beg of you to forgive me. It's a miracle. Thank you, thank you. Dr. Lister. He wants to meet you. He's travelled all the way from England. I feel it a great honor to be present. The honor is mine, doctor. I'm well acquainted with the work you're doing in antiseptics. Thanks to you and your brilliant leadership. Such is fame. Mad dog! Mad dog! Mad dog! He bit me! Take him to the blacksmith's. See? This is one. Make ten of none. Count two and three before let be. Come five and six the witch's fix. late seven and eight, this can be straight And nine is one and ten is none. And this is the witch's once once one. No! Not all the doctors in Europe could do more for him. He'll be lucky if he doesn't get rabies even now. And yet if we could find the cause. The cause of rabies, doctor. Perhaps a cure would follow. There must be a way. Mother Annette At this hour Why doesn't Jean come home? -He's working with father. -But he's my husband. Bu dear, he hasn't forgotten that. Science, science Everything's science. I'm going to have a baby. Doesn't he realize that? When I was your age, I had babies but I didn't cry about it. Yes, and how many of them lived? Annette Oh, Mother, I'm so frightened. Now, now I want to see Father. I want to talk to him. You'll alarm him needlessly. Aren't you ashamed? You know how easily worried he is. Where is M. Pasteur? He can't be disturbed just now. What is it? It's about the veterinarian. You wait here. I'll speak to him. It doesn't work. Nothing works. We've been following the same procedure that we did with anthrax. Which only shows how little we know about disease. Nature's far too subtle to repeat herself. I'm sorry, Jean, darling. You're in the middle of an experiment. I didn't mean to disturb you. It's all right, dear. You better go back. Father might need you. In a while. I'll see you home. It won't be necessary. I have the coach with me. Attention, all of you. So far we've been unable to find the microbe that causes rabies. Yet our experiments have shown that it exists. Now listen carefully. As soon as the veterinarian comes wait Where's Martel? Just a moment, please. Martel! Martel -Good night, dear. -Good night. -Good night -Martel Martel coming -Where is he? What is he doing? -Annette was here. Annette? -How is she? -She's all right. It's eleven o'clock, Louis. Now what about your supper? Oh, a minute, dear. Just a minute. You said a minute three hours ago and you've eaten nothing. And we could all do with a little supper, I think. well All right. Tell them to stop. but We're to resume in half an hour. -Cecile -yes, Madam Supper Hello There you are. That's the veterinarian. Open the door. -Louis? -Yes? I have a letter for you. It came by special post from England. From Dr. Lister. Let me see it. Not until you've eaten. -Oh, but it's important, Marie. -Very well. I'll read it to you. Dear, sir My observations lead me to believe you are a scoundrel. What? I'm told you are a slave driver to your assistants. That you neglect your wife, abuse your family This is no time to joke. No. Not until you've eaten. I'll tell you what he said. My dear Pasteur, That's different. Your recent paper on the known sources of infection is admirable in every detail. Forgive the frankness with which a common love of science inspires me. I embrace you. My fellow workers in Brussels and Prague have reported that their hospitals are rapidly becoming safe. Mothers can go to them without fear. That's where Annette should be sent for her confinement. These doctors in Paris That isn't all he says. I do not hesitate to acclaim you the most valuable man yet to enter the field of science. it's nothing, Marie It's a dog. A mad dog. Open his mouth. I want to get as much of it as I can. Steady now. Louis Louis, stop! -Not hydrophobia. -Marie I've pledged myself to find a cure. I can't stop now. Not until I've exhausted every effort to rid the world of this deadly disease. M. Pasteur refuses to attend our meeting But he continues to impose on the credulity of the people. Too often has he touted the columns of the papers with his theories. What about his vaccine for anthrax? That's not a theory. It's a fact. It not only elected him to this academy But it helped our poor farmers save enough money to pay for the entire Franco-Prussian war. In the name of French science Science? You abuse the word. I stand here to defend the honor of French medicine against the tricks of a charlatan. Dr. Zaranoff I am a Prussian. I came here for a different purpose. Commissioned by my government to investigate Pasteur's efforts. His fame has spread to the peasantry of my country who for centuries have been preyed upon by rabid wolves. I have spent all my life studying rabies or hydrophobia as we call it. And monsieurs I would worship I would kneel to any man who would point the way to a cure. I deny that miccrobes can be the cause of rabies or any other disease. Dr. Charbonnet How do we know that bacteria are not harmful? How do we know they do not do their deadly work as Pasteur claims? If Pasteur is not willling to come to us let us go to Pasteur. To be humiliated further? You, I, the whole academy? Humility is a virtue, monsieur. Not only in those who suffer but in those who hope to heal. All right, let us go. Let us see what this great man can teach us. Thank you, madam better Fortunately we found you in, monsieur. It's the wish of some that the Academy of Medicine honor you. Honor me? And to be brief Dr. Zaranoff here has been reading your recent statements in the journal. How do you do, doctor? Promising a cure for rabies. The press takes liberties, doctor. As usual, my remarks were grossly exaggerated. In other words, you have no grounds for making such a prediction? -Grounds? -Proof No not yet I didn't think so. What an odor! In your last paper to the academy, monsieur you stated that you were on the threshold of a vast new world. Might I inquire if you've crossed that threshold? Science takes a step then another then it stops and reflects before taking a third. A mother takes a nursing child, puts it down, says, "walk" The child takes the first step. then another then it stops unsteadily. Would the mother be right to say to him, "You are hesitating."? You will never walk? Put out that pipe. It stinks to high heaven. You were saying. Step by step, I'm reaching the ultimate conclusion. That microbes are the cause of all disease. If you men are still skeptical if microbes are still a myth to you then listen. One drop of this rabies virus on the slightest scratch will kill a man. I hold enough in my hands to wipe out a whole city. Ridiculous! To think that this could kill a man. All I want now is to have you predict the hour of my death. It's over a month now and he's still in perfect health. Really. -I saw him here yesterday -You did? Oh, here he comes now. -Hello, Charbonnet. How are you today? -Splendid. Never felt better. According to Pasteur, you ought to be in your grave. The more germs I take the better I feel. Cecile, please tell Monsieur that Dr. Rossignol is here. yes, madam. Something ought to be done. I've just come from the boulevard. Charbonnet is making a laughingstock of your husband. Parading up and down, showing off doing everything he can to attract attention to himself. And ridiculing M. Pasteur. Louis doesn't mind ridicule. If he thinks he's right, that's all that matters. M. Pasteur, I've come to warn you about Charbonnet. You can't afford to be made ridiculous. The work you're doing is too important. Important? I wish it were. It isn't. Not yet. My results have all been negative. You haven't been able to discover the microbe? Is that what you mean? Not a sign. You seemed so confident the day we were here. I still am. Every animal that was inoculated with the contents of that test tube died. Charbonnet, for some reason, resisted the disease. Why I don't know. Louis, are you sure it was the same tube? Positive. It was the only specimen I had. You may have let it stand too long. You told me once the germs grow weaker. Less virulent with age. Wait It might be. -Roux -Yes? How old was that virus when Charbonnet injected it into his arm? Fourteen days. And when was it last used on the rabbit? Oh, about a week before, I believe. A week. Are you sure? Just a moment. Here's the record. -Nine days to be exact. -There's your answer. It must be. It's the only conceivable explanation. You think by allowing the virus to age you were able to render it harmless? Not harmless but weak. Weak enough for the system to overcome. Even if that's true, it won't help you any. When a man is bitten he gets the germ full strength. Not attenuated. Precisely. But suppose we started with a fourteen day old virus that's no longer deadly? Suppose we injected it into a healthy animal and day by day as nature builds up its resistance we increase the dosage with stronger fresher virus Until the animal is able to withstand the actual disease that we find in the world at large. Would he not then be immune? It would be impossible. It would never work. If the first injection didn't kill him the second would. Or the third. Roux Where are those tubes you've been preparing? Right here. Let me have them. They're all in order. Each one is dated. Here we are. Fourteen days. Jean? Yes, monsieur. -Jean, how many dogs do we have left? -Ten Are they well, healthy? In perfect condition. They've never been exposed. Give them hydrophobia. You mean? Give them hydrophobia. Open the door. There you are. There you are. Everybody gets his share. If it hadn't been for Charbonnet we might never have discovered this treatment. Poor Charbonnet. Little does he know that he's been our favorite guinea pig. Louis? Yes, dear. Will you come, please? There's a doctor to see you. A doctor? Wait a minute, wait a minute. M. Pasteur, I am Dr. Pfeiffer. I apologize for not giving you notice but we came all the way from Alsace. We? Oh, I beg your pardon. Here they are. Madam Meister, monsieur. Her child is a patient of mine. The boy has been bitten by a dog. I have done everything I could but there is very little. -Should he develop hydrophobia -You can help him They told us you could. Give me your hand, little fellow. Don't be afraid. I won't hurt you. My little boy. My little Joseph. How long has it been? Five days. Have you cauterized the wound? Not right away. It must have been twenty four hours. Does that mean I'm going to die? Of course not. Little boys don't die. They have too much to live for. He won't live. He won't. I know he won't Last year it was the laborer's child of ours. -Now he... -Keep quiet! -What does that have to do with you? -Oh, save him! Save him, save him! Marie Put him to bed and see that he's kept warm. There now You mustn't be frightened. We'll go upstairs, shall we? You must be tired after all that long journey. -Mother -I'm coming, darling. I'm coming. Are you quite sure the dog was rabid? Beyond a doubt. I made the test myself. Is there anything you can do? I don't know. I'm just experimenting. I have hopes but I... Roux Find Dr. Rossignol for me at once. What harm in this is there, Dr. Rossignol? I'm sorry. Since death is the only alternative for the boy I would be willing to try anything. Wouldn't you, Dr. Rossignol? I'm sorry. I can't agree. Much as I admire Pasteur's accomplishments. Nevertheless, when human life is at stake I'd have to take a long while before going contrary to the best medical knowledge. Which in this case means to let the boy die. We do what we can, administer drugs, sedatives Is there a single cure of hydrophobia on record? I'm not arguing for it. I'm merely pointing out what the accepted treatment happens to be. To embark upon a new course is always dangerous. From a professional point of view. And it would be doubly so for M. Pasteur who is a chemist not a doctor. And could expect no support from the medical profession. For his sake, therefore, I strongly advise That nothing irregular be attempted. Good evening, monsieurs. You're not going to listen to him, are you? Don't misunderstand me. My treatment has saved dogs. Ten of them. But I haven't the faintest notion what effect it would have upon a human being. If I failed It would mean prison perhaps the guillotine. If you change your mind, I beg of you, let me know. Good night. Louis You didn't. They'll put you in prison. They'll put you in prison. He's asleep. Good morning, Jean. Good morning, madam. Any news of Annette? Seems to me the time is drawing near. That's what I want to talk to you about. The doctor I've been counting on is ill. -LeClaire? -Yes I'm sure Louis will find someone to take his place. Yes, but when it comes to the use of antiseptics It's very difficult to find anyone you can trust. Martel Yes, monsieur. How is the boy? He has a fever. The third injection made him ill. Is Roux with him? What are you going to do now? Do? Give him a fourth. A fifth. A sixth. If he lives. Is that test finished? -No, not quite. -Why not? What's wrong? One of the vials was accidentally broken. Idiots! Clumsy fools. I will not stand for it. Do you hear? Do it yourself. Very well. Don't let another soul touch it. Louis You haven't closed your eyes in forty eight hours. There'll be time enough later. But there won't. That's just the trouble. You'll go on and on. Marie I've been lucky all my life. Luckier than I deserved. But if i fail now You won't fail. The boy will recover. And when he does, we'll go away. We'll take a long vacation. Martel, Roux All of them. They need it more than we do. How fine they've been. How patient. They'll never know how grateful I am. -Why don't you should tell them? -I will. I will. And you, Marie... You, most of all. What have I done to warrant such devotion? Do you remember what you said when you asked me to marry you? You said, There's nothing about me to attract a young girl's fancy. But those who've known me very well have come to like me. Did I say that? Was I really that vain? You knew better too. You were looking in a mirror when you said that. This way, please. A thousand pardons for intruding. I just came from the Russian embassy. Look out the window. Look. They are peasants. Victims of rabid wolves. My government has sent them to you. So soon? Madam, your husband's cure's the talk of the country. But it hasn't been proven yet. That's why they're here. To offer themselves for the test, Pasteur. It's a marvelous oppotunity. Yes, a marvelous oppotunity. To kill! To murder. Stay away, Louis. Don't let them see you. Pasteur I'm a scientist, Zaranoff, not a magician. My treatment was intended for dogs. But these are men. Pasteur, think of it. Surely you won't refuse. Pasteur, Pasteur, Pasteur Take them to the hospital. Isolate them. I want a full report on every case. Thank you, monsieur, thank you. More than life. What a triumph Good day, madam. A thousand pardons. Good day, doctor. Madam? Yes, Cecile. How's the boy? The same. He's had the injection. That makes four. -Roux -Yes? Tell the men they're not to leave the laboratory under any circumstances. Is that clear? -I may need them at a moment's notice. -Very well. Now madam, what should I tell the coachman? Is he still here? -He's waiting in the kitchen. -Just a moment. Louis It's Annette and Dr. LeClaire is ill. -LeClaire ill? -I think I better call Jean. Not a word to Jean. -Jean stays here. -Louis -He's her husband. -The work he's doing must be finished. But what are we going to do? Don't worry. I'll see she gets the proper care. Is the doctor in? Dr. Ferrare is out on a case. He won't be home until midnight. Midnight. Is Dr. Zomia in I'm very sorry, monsieur, but the doctor's gone to the Riviera for a month's vacation he was here last time -Is there any message? -No, no, thank you. Dominic, hold on. I want to speak to you I want to speak to you. I need help. My daughter's having a child. Splendid but why come to me? Is she all right? This is my wife, Dr. Charbonnet. She will help you. -You can depend on her. -Madam, I am deeply honored. Charbonnet? Cecile, boil some water. I'll go back to Annette. A large kettle full. You're not going to use those instruments without boiling them? Certainly. I won't permit it. My dear Pasteur, I'm doing this as a professional courtesy. Do it my way. Please. All right. I'll do it your way. But I'll make a bargain with you. A bargain? I, Louis Pasteur, hereby acknowledge If I live another month without contracting hydrophobia I shall be priveledged to publish this in the leading scientific journals of Europe. -Keep them boiling Yes, monsieur. -Where's the patient? -Wait, wait. Wash your hands first. Take it all off. Now roll up your sleeves. Wash them to the elbows. What's that? Don't be afraid. It's only a little bichloride. Now use the brush. The brush, the brush. Louis Yes, yes. In a moment. There. Does that suit you Yes. That's better. Now there's a clean towel over there. Cecile, hurry. You may go in now. My daughter's ready. Don't touch it! What? Your hands. Your hands. You've spoiled it now. You'll have to wash them again. See here. I've brought hundreds of babies into the world. Remember our bargain. Do as I say. Such foolishness. Now, hold them up high. What next? Touch nothing but the patient. What about my instruments? They'll be brought to you. Louis Louis, we have a grandson. A grandson. Louis Dr. Charbonnet, come quickly. My husband's ill. Louis. Louis. He's had a stroke. My My left side is paralyzed? Only slightly. It's nothing serious. When did it happen? A few days ago. A few days. You were more tired than anything else. Feeling better? The Meister boy. He's doing splendidly. Thank God. And The Russians. Have you been able to help them? The hospital refused to allow our treatment without permission from the academy. The permission was granted this morning. But it was too late, Three of them died yesterday. Horribly -Let me up. -Please, Louis. I must go. How many are left? Nineteen. But it's no use. It's hopeless. If our efforts can save one it will be well worth it. Let me up, someone. Get me dressed. What's going on, doctor? Pasteur himself is going to treat the Russians. But I'm afraid it's too late. -Dr. Charbonnet, why don't you come in? -I don't want to disturb him. Patient number one three cc's Jean Patient number two Dr. Charbonnet I didn't thank you for delivering my grandchild. You've been ill, monsieur. I'm sorry. Perhaps this note will help speed your recovery. A bargain's a bargain. I want the Pasteur treatment for hydrophobia. How are they today? Much better. That's good. Nineth day, patient number one. -Any change? -Not this morning. Continue treatment. -Eight day old virus? -Yes. Patient number five. How are the Russian patients today? Doing very well. Pasteur makes his final visit tomorrow. Good morning, doctor. Good morning, madam. How is my little Joseph this morning? He's fine and such an appetite. Go right in. He's gone. He's gone. Joseph You little rascal you. Now get dressed. But how can we ever get Monsieur there? I'll take care of that part of it. He won't consent to go if he suspects. He won't suspect. You leave that to me. Marie M. Pasteur Joseph Are you ready? Now you wait a moment. I've a little surprise for you to take home. M. Pasteur Madam Meister wants to thank you once more before leaving. I think you are a man who will always be remembered. No, no, no, no Good bye. -Good bye -Good bye, monsieur. -Good bye. -Joseph -Can you write? -Yes. Would you like to write to me? Yes, very much. Then Let me hear from you every month. Won't you? Yes I will. Don't forget. I'll be looking for your letters. Joseph? Yes? Thank you. -Goodbye. -Goodbye. By the way, Louis Roux's just told me that a foreign scientist is a lecturer at the academy tonight. He claims to have disproven your entire germ theory. What? Who is he? What's his name? I don't know. Order me a carriage. I've got to be there. You're just in time. Courage, dear. I'll be listening from the balcony. Whom are they applauding? The speaker, Dr. Lister from England. Lister? Lister to speak against me? Ladies and gentlemen The tribute that we render Pasteur on this occasion is small indeed compared to the countless millions who will honor his memory in generations to come. The vaccines for anthrax and hydrophobia are great accomplishments. But even greater still, I believe is the fact that thousands of people will be saved from unnecessary death from infection. And mothers need no longer fear surgery or childbirth. In the name of France I greet you. M. Pasteur I greet you in the name of humanity. Lister Great Lister From his imperial majesty The czar of all Russia with profoundest gratitude. I have no words to express. You young men doctors and scientists of the future do not let yourselves be tainted by apparent skepticism nor discouraged by the sadness of certain hours that creep over nations. do not become angry at your opponents for no scientific theory has ever been accepted without opposition. Live in the serene peace of libraries and laboratories. Say to yourselves first what have I done for my instruction. And as you gradually advance what am I accomplishing? Until the time comes when you may have the immense happiness of thinking that you have contributed in some way to the welfare and progress of mankind.
