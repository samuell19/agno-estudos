[ Groaning ] [ Vomiting, Coughing ] Love sucks! Morning! What? No coffee! I'm having herbal tea. Well, I need my caffeine. Want me to whip up one of my special omelets? Thank you, no. - Upset tummy again? - Morning sickness. - Funny girl. - Donald, we need to have a talk. It's them-- The Mexican moron brothers. Donald? Donald! - What? - I said we need to talk. We will, Barbie, as soon as I've had it out with our two tree killers. It's time for a confrontation. Yes, it is. [ Lawn Mower Whirring ] All right, mister, it's time we settled this once and for all. Ooh! Mr. Chandler, you shouldn't do that. You could've been hurt. Don't worry about that. Let's talk about my tree. It's dying. I think you might be right. - Maybe you would like to explain to me why? - I don't know. - Nothing seems to work. This might be an act of God. - You better pray it's not. This tree dies, you're fired! You comprende? Yeah, I comprehend very well. Good! ♪♪ [ Humming ] Sorry, mister. No English. Sorry.Hey! What, the tree again? When the last leaf falls, you and I will be fired. Then let's quit right now, 'cause this thing's gonna die! No way, man. We need the money. You know that. Let's get to work. [ Weed Whacker Whirring ] I'm terribly sorry. We are completely booked. Come on, honey. Let's not let this spoil our honeymoon. We'll find some other nice restaurant. Thanks.Have a nice day. Okay, what did I miss?The shoes. Oh, the shoes! I always miss that.I know. The dynamic duo.Oh, brother. Jackie, Barbara, what an unexpected pleasure.Donald. So, what brings you two lovely ladies here today? We were supposed to have a talk? We were. I'm sorry, darling. It completely slipped my mind. Well, since we're all here together, it might be a good idea to sit down and have a little family chat. Of course. Why don't we enjoy lunch while we're at it? Good luck. All right! Lunch is now being served in the main parking lot. - How much do I owe you? - Nothing! It's your birthday! I'm buying you lunch. Thank you, my friend. Don't worry about it. On my birthday, you can take me out. Except we're goin' someplace better than this. Miguel, what do you wish for on your birthday? - I don't believe in wishes. - Come on! If I could wish for something, it would be for Catalina to be with us. Catalina! Hey, if your sister didn't have such a bad temper, she could be living with us now. Threatening to castrate that immigration guy with a spoon, that wasn't too smart. He was trying to cop a feel, Tobias. Maybe he was, maybe he wasn't. But the bottom line is that right now... Catalina is still living in Mexico... with a spoon, brother. We are offering some tasty specials today. We didn't come here to eat, Donald. Donald, Barbara has just informed me that... I'm going to be a... grandmother. You're-- [ Mouths Word ] Good afternoon, ladies, Mr. Chandler. Can I start you with something to drink today? I'll have a mineral water with a squeeze. I'll have a white wine. Something full-bodied and woody. You choose. - I'll have a shot-- Tequila. - Tequila? - Yes! I've just been informed that I'm going to be a father. - Congratulations! You're not the father, Donald. Bring the bottle. - What are you saying? - Apparently our Barbie doll has been having an affair. - With whom? - Daniel Gabois. - The car salesman? - He owns the dealership. Children, the occupation of this man is not the question. The question is, how are we going to handle the situation? He sold us the Benz.Donald, please. I talked to my lawyers this morning. And the simplest way to fix this... mess is to file for an annulment. It can be quick and painless. Oh, and I've already found someone who's interested in buying the restaurant. Jackie, I put my heart and soul into this place. While you totally ignored me. If you sell the restaurant, we'll both end up taking a major loss. - Consider it a write-off. - A write-off? For you, maybe. It'll ruin me. I'll be lucky to have enough money to open a taco stand! Oh! And I'm sure they'll be excellent tacos. Jackie, please. You can't do this to me. Oh, Donald, don't start playing the martyr. It's so unbecoming. Look at it this way. You married into money. And now you'll be "unmarrying" out of money. No, I'm not gonna let you do this. I'll take you to court if I have to. [ Women Laughing ] Oh, Donald, don't be silly. Silly? I'm not the one who was unfaithful here. But I'm the one getting screwed. Well, that is my best and final offer. I believe we're finished here. Have a nice day, dear.

But it's your birthday and I wanna get you a drink. [ Spanish ] Okay, just one, though.That's cool. That's all I can afford. You should shave off that ugly mustache for your birthday. This mustache is G.Q., bro.I'm just playin' with you, man. [ Spanish ] What, man? Just being friendly. I know. Too friendly. [ Everyone ] Surprise! Happy birthday. Hey, I told you I didn't want a birthday party.I felt different. [ Spanish ] Happy birthday, Dad! More drinking! How are you? [ Spanish ] One for me and one for the [ Spanish ] here.And one for me too! All right! [ Spanish ] [ Spanish ] Ahhh.Whoo! Worm food. When we die, that is what we are-- worm food. And while we are alive, we are the food for women. You women, you just like to feed on our dreams, don't you? And when those are all eaten up-- yeah, gone, then you start to gnaw on our self-respect. Don't look at me. I've been on a diet lately. - Whatever happened to good old-fashioned male bartenders? - You're the one who hired me. I did, didn't I? In that case, you're fired. Are you serious? No. I need another drink. Mr. "C," why don't you let me call one of your friends to pick you up and take you home? I don't have any friends. How 'bout I call you a taxi? No, no. If I'm to go gentle into that good night, I'm gonna go in style. Get me a limo. This will make all our wishes come true. [ Spanish ] Gracias,Ansiana. Hey. A lottery ticket. You know what I think about these things. It's a waste of good money. This is how you thank someone for a gift? Be careful, man. You know what a powerful brujaAnsiana is. You make jokes about my powers? I'm just playin' with you, old woman. Speaking of which, it's lottery time! Eduardo, put on channel nine! Don't you wanna see if you won? I've already won. I have you, two wonderful kids, and plenty of friends. - Why don't you check the numbers for me? - Whoo! What else did we get? - Come on. Come on. - [ Muttering ] [ Spanish ] Missed it. Ansiana?

Sounds great, bro, because I think you just won it. - Let me see that. - What? [ Donald ] "Now that you're pregnant with another man's child, "there is only one path left for me to walk. "May the ending of my life... " be a new and happier life for you, blah, blah, blah. Sincerely, Donald." Well, that oughta keep that bitch in therapy for a while.

This is a nice place, bro.It's all right. Mr. Chandler! Mrs. Chandler. Whoo! Damn! Somebody's been partying, bro. Come on! Don't be drinking that! Oh, Miguel! What happened? He hosed himself. Why, man? Why would a man who has so much do such a thing? He probably heard we were quitting.This is nothing to joke about. Check it out. He left a note! What's it say? His wife got knocked up by some other dude. He can't live without her. "Good-bye, cruel world." .- [ Groaning ] - [ Gasps ] - Mr. Chandler? - You-- It's me, Miguel Sanchez. I don't like you. You killed my tree. Get out of my dream. You're not dreaming, Mr. Chandler. What am I doing out here talking to you? - I think you tried to kill yourself. - But the damn branch broke. - Tobias, please! - [ Groaning ] It's all your fault. My fault! I don't even know your wife. I'm a happily married man. The tree, you idiot. If you hadn't killed my tree, the branch wouldn't have broke. We wouldn't be having this conversation, would we? Oh, my head! Relax. There's plenty of branches strong enough for you to finish the job. Tobias! It's not so bad, man. [ Groaning ] No? My wife wants an annulment. I lost my restaurant. I have no money. - You're still a young man. - What are you doing here? It's Thursday. - We came to tell you that we quit. - Fine. You kick a man when he's down.I'm really sorry, Mr. Chandler. It's not a joke! I think you're really gonna like this idea. [ Whispering ] Except we gotta got talk in private. [ Spanish ] Can you excuse us for a second, Mr. Chandler? Okay? One second. So what's your big idea? I think we should hire el jefe.I thought you said it was not a joke. No, it's not a joke! He's a desperate man. And that's exactly what we need right now.Why do we need a desperate man? We can hire him to marry your sister.Oh, no, no, no, no. Catalina can finally come here to live with us. We tried it before. It didn't work. She scared them away before anyone could say, "I do." That's why we need a desperate man. No offense, bro, but your sister-- she's not an easy person to live with. She's had a hard life.[ Tobias ] Yeah, I know. But now you can afford to make it an easy life. But it's gonna take a desperate man to make that happen. [ Groaning ] I believe that we're looking at such a man. It's true. I have been blessed with a great deal of money. Maybe we should offer Mr. Chandler our assistance. As an act of charity.Act of charity! All right. [ Clears Throat ] Mr. Chandler, my brother-in-law has convinced me to offer you our assistance. - Yeah! We wanna hire you! - [ Chuckling ] Sorry, boys, I don't do lawns. [ Laughing ] Oh, I'm afraid you misunderstand us, Mr. Chandler. You see, recently I came into a great deal of money.Like 62 million in chump change! That's right! - You what? - I won the lottery last night! That's why we came to quit. And what we wanna hire you to do ain't got nothing to do with mowing lawns! I can't think without my coffee. You care to join me for a cup? There is something wrong with this picture. - Why do you say that? - First of all, you two don't like me very much. That's true. -Yet you're willing to loan me the money to open a restaurant. -If you marry my sister, yes. - Why me? - You ain't met his sister. What is she? A short, fat woman with a noticeable mustache? Actually, no. Catalina's a very beautiful woman. It's just that, um, she's got a bit of a temper. - Bit of a temper-- - [ Pounds Table ] She's fine, man. If that's all it is, no "problemo," amigos. I'm a professional at dealing with women with attitudes. Let's talk more about the restaurant part of this deal, shall we? Tobias, what's going on? Why are all these people here? [ Spanish ] [ Miguel ] Excuse me. Can I please get out? Excuse me. Excuse me. [ Spanish ] Excuse me. Coming through. Excuse me, all right? Inside. Come on! Let's go in! Bye! Yea! We won the lotto!

We're gonna go play "white boy" Monopoly.Real money? You know it! You guys got cash, yeah?Tobias, no. I'm just playin' with 'em. Oh, baby. - [ Ringing ] - Oh, God! Oh, God! Did you see that? Yesterday we're moaning 'cause we don't have enough money. And today we're moaning 'cause we have too much. Life is crazy. - I think I know where to leave the madness behind us. - How? Tonight we will be moving into a new house in a beautiful neighborhood. Miguel, where? The home of my future brother-in-law. I think I found somebody for Catalina to marry. Oh, no, Miguel. Not again! [ Sighs ] I will survive. Thank you. [ Doorbell Chimes ] Who the hell is that? Miguel. - How you doin', Mr. Chandler? - What a surprise. I got some great news. My sister has agreed to marry you. Well, that is good news! What exactly are you doing here? We're moving in... a little earlier than we planned. - Moving in. - Yeah. You don't understand. It's been crazy at our house. I decided it would be best for the family... to leave the madness behind us, and move in with you tonight. Whoa, whoa, wait a minute. Let's back up a little bit. I don't recall this moving-in thing being part of our agreement. Oh, but it was. For the next two years, and a couple of weeks, we're gonna be one big, happy family.No, no, no, no, no. I never agreed to anything like that. Come, Miguel. I can tell we're not welcome here. [ Spanish ] It was a small misunderstanding. I'm sure I can find someone else to marry Catalina. Come on. Whoa! Wait a minute, folks. I'm sure we can come to some agreement that we all can live with. It's either gonna involve all of us, or none of us. The question is, Donald, do you still wanna be part of this agreement? I do. Then, by the power invested in me, the state of California, I now pronounce you man and wife. You can kiss the bride. I think a simple handshake will suffice. Ay,no, Miguel! I think the one you had me marry is one who likes the boys! If you're going to insult me, use something more original. The gay thing is old material. Aha! So others have suspected your true tastes. It matters little to me, but it is traditional for the groom to kiss the bride. - You want me to kiss you. - As distasteful as I may find it, yes. Our guests are watching. Fine! [ Cheering ] ♪♪ [ Latin ] I hope you kiss your boyfriends better than that. Actually I'm accustomed to kissing warm-blooded women. Your fish lips threw me off. Fish lips? Listen to me, you little worm! Catalina! Donald! You have plenty of time to compare each other to all kinds of animals. For now we have a celebration to host. Can we greet our guests? You remind me of a dog I once had fixed. [ Miguel ] Be nice. ♪♪ [ Singing In Spanish ] We did it![ Laughing ] Donald, here are the keys to the restaurant. Thank you, Miguel.Sure. Hi! [ Spanish ] [ Spits ] Oh, look. Aunt Methuselah just spit on my shoes. [ Spanish ] [ Continues In Spanish ] Care to translate that?Yeah, sure. She said that you are no longer a real man, 'cause you sold your soul for money. You move to the song of life, but without a soul, you can no longer feel the music. And now you're just simply a dancing bear in the circus. Thatwas an insult. It was poetic, yet cutting. You can learn from this woman. Thank you, Ansiana, for you have given me a wedding present. You gave me the nickname to my husband, el oso, the dancing bear. Come, Oso, dance with your wife.I don't dance. Maybe I should teach you. Why don't we save that for our divorce when we have something to really celebrate. I'm gone. Don't you dare walk out on our wedding day!You watch me! Let him go. Everyone knows this is not a real marriage. That man has no manners. [ Chuckling ] [ Door Creaking ] Oso's back. Ansiana, you shouldn't call Donald that. It's disrespectful.If the shoe fits! [ Footsteps ] Miguel, you should've warned him. It's okay. Donald and Catalina are married now. Some things they've gotta work out themselves. Ow! That hurt! You could've put my eye out! My aim was off. Next time you'll knock. Knock? I don't have to knock when I come into my bedroom. And this is mine too! I don't want you touching my things. They're expensive. Now I want you to leave. No! While we're married, this will be my room! Now let's see what kind of a man you really are. Get out! Out! Your sister just threatened me with a fork! I'm sure she didn't mean it. I'll talk to her tomorrow. No. I'd like you to talk to her right now. She has the impression that my room is now hers. Donald, you and Catalina are married now. Okay? - Wherever you decide to sleep has nothing to do with me. - But that's my room! Here. Go and show your bride who the man is. Hmm? - Hola,Uncle Donald! - What are you two still doing up? We were wondering who's gonna sleep here tonight.Now you know. Happy? Yeah! Will you tell us a story, Uncle Donald? Please don't call me Uncle Donald. Makes me sound like a duck. Then what should we call you? I don't care. Be creative. How about Uncle Oso? Fine. Will you tell us a story, Uncle Oso? Sorry, guys, but entertaining the two of you isn't in my contract! Now, if you don't mind, it's my wedding night. I've got a big headache, and I'd like to be alone. It wasn't all a bad dream. What are you doing here? Just paying Miguel back the money I borrowed from him.The whole two million? Oh, yeah! Stock market's been real good to me. Here, Oso, I cook this especially for you. Sorry, Ansiana, but I have never considered beans as a breakfast food. Besides, you probably spit in it. - It's because we're Mexican! - [ Juanita ] It was nothing, Miguel. You may live in a very beautiful neighborhood, but the people here can be very ugly! -Why? What happened? -The girl at the market asked if we'd be paying in food stamps! - And? - "And?" How would you like it if she asked you that? It's because we're Mexican! I don't think that's it. Well, not entirely it. Look, I don't know how to put this gently. But the main reason the people around here treat you the way they do, is-- It's the way you dress. There's nothing wrong with the way we dress! This is a very fashionable neighborhood. The people here are fashion-conscious. Oh, my God! You're just like the rest of 'em!Miguel. Wasn't it you that told me it's the man inside the clothes that count? And it is. As long as you're well-dressed. Come on, Miguel. What I'm saying isn't exactly news. It's been going on since the dawn of man! Cavemen used to hunt the meanest, most dangerous animals in the forest. Quite often, they'd lose an arm and a leg in the process. Why? For the skins. We're no longer cavemen. You're absolutely right. Times change, fashions change, animal skins are no longer in. But the concept remains the same. People still go out. They spend an arm and a leg for clothes that say, "Hey! Look at me. I'm very powerful. I deserve respect." - This is a foolish way of thinking. - Of course. That's the way it is. That's all the time we have for today's lecture on "Lifestyles of the Rich and Foolish." I got things to do. I'll get it. Good morning! What can I do for you? I'm a Peacock. Buy my cookies. Darling, that's not the way to sell your product. Maybe if you said "please," you would sell a lot more cookies. I never say please to the hired help. I'm sorry. Alexandra's in one of her moods today. Is the lady of the house in? You're speaking to her. - Ah, you must be the man of the house. - What can we do for you? - Buy my damn cookies! - We don't buy cookies from spoiled little girls! - Your housekeeper seems to have a bit of an attitude problem. - Almost as bad as your girl. - Well, I never! - I'm not surprised. I'm also not interested in anything you're selling. Good day. There goes my brief moment of peace. Relax, Oso, I'm giving you the night off. - What are you making? - Pancakes. - Panqueques! - No. Pancakes. Panqueques. - I want some too. - Sure. Why not? You're using this? That is pure Vermont maple syrup. The best. .Syrup is for the mornings. For the evenings-- Yes!What? [ Spanish ] You're in for a real treat.[ Spanish ] Yeah, it's kind of a goat's milk, sugar, kind of a caramel. Why don't you sit down? I'll show you how panqueques should be made. I just wanna have my--Shh! Your wife has spoken. Go. Sit. Go, go, go, go, go! Well? Good.Of course they are. Just don't expect me to start cooking for you, okay? [ Miguel ] What are you doing?Surrendering to our late-night cravings. "Pancaca." Panqueques con-- [ Spanish ] No! Sí!And there are two left. You can have 'em. I'm gonna go to sleep. I cooked, you clean. Oh, man, I love these! When your sister isn't being possessed by Satan, she can be pretty nice. Catalina's not had an easy life. We lost our parents when we were very young. I came to California to live with an uncle. Catalina stayed in Mexico and was passed on from family to family. Given her temper, I can understand why. She wasn't like that then. At least not at first. It's just that every time she got close to one family, she would find herself being passed on... to another family.That must've been rough. We kept on trying to bring her to California, but nothing ever worked out. Then there was a little problem with an immigration agent. I'm glad you told me about her. I'll call the parish and cancel the exorcism. [ Thunderclaps ] [ Screaming ] Uncle Oso! Uncle Oso! Snakes!Huh? - Snakes? - Under my bed! /[ Sighs ] This used to be such a nice neighborhood. They got really big blue and green eyes and long sharp fangs. They sound just like the ones that are in my bed. [ Sighs ] Relax, Domi, I was joking. Can I sleep with you? You're a big boy now. You should be sleeping in your own bed. - Please? - Oh, no. Not the tears. Come on. [ Thunderclaps ] I'm sorry.Ah, that's all right. No need to be sorry. Everybody's afraid of something. What are you afraid of?Me? Let's see. I'm afraid of big dogs without collars, people who have homemade tattoos with bad spelling, and your Aunt Cat. But enough about me. Let's go to sleep and dream about nice things, huh? You don't have any problems with bed-wetting, do you? Not most of the time. How very reassuring. Donald, I've made a decision. The time has come for me to spread my new wealth on my family. It's time we go shopping for new clothes suitable for our new social position. Good for you. If you'd like, I'd be happy to recommend a few good stores. I would consider it a personal favor if you came along. You seem to have a good sense of style, right?Yeah.

Maybe we should get together sometime. Grab some lunch or-- What do you think of this one, Oso? - Oso? - Yes. It's a pet name for my husband. You're married to Donald? Yes. And just who the hell are you? Oh, Cat, this is my ex-wife, Barbara. Barbara, this is my future ex-wife, Catalina. Well, didn't take you very long to find someone else. This is why you wanted to go shopping? You were hoping to run into this woman? - I should've known better. - Cat, if you're looking for a fight, pick one with her. I'm gonna check on Miguel. Look at the time. I gotta run. It was nice meeting you, "Carolina." Hell no! Listen to me, sweetheart. The Colombia-coffee-bean-pickin' spokesperson look... is cute in a Latino sort of way, but that's not what we're goin' for here. That mustache? It's just got to go. Man, all I want is a haircut, okay? - Then you gonna have to go to a barber. - Donald? Miguel, if you don't like it, you can grow it back. But I like my mustache, man!

The tie sucks. You're right. We have definite "tie suckage" here. Let's go with something with a little more color. Hey. Something wrong, Oso? No, you just surprised me. I've never seen you dressed up like this before. Money becomes you. - You going somewhere special tonight? - I'm going with you. No way! Don't even think about it. But your wife should be there on such an important event. I've invited a lot of big fish. There's no way I'm bringing along a barracuda. Relax, Oso. I promise I'll be nice. Tonight I'll play the role of your loving wife. I'm sorry. This is too important to take the chance that you'll explode in somebody's face. If you don't take me, I'm coming anyway. And I promise you it won't be pretty. The choice is yours. Which do you want? The lady... or the barracuda? - Let's see what your brother has to say about this. - Fine! [ Together ] Miguel! Yeah, but a mustache is a very personal thing! Donald, you're just the person I needed to see. We do need to talk.This is my friend, Hector. I'm thinking about lending him the money to open up a barbershop. I just think that he should shave off that mustache. He looks like a thug. - Come on, Miguel. - It's important for a barber to be clean-shaven. So lose the mustache! I had to marry his sister to get him to loan me money. While we're on the subject of business, did you realize that Catalina is insisting on going tomy grand opening? - Take her. She's already dressed for the occasion. - Exactly! - What harm could she do? - Let me count the ways. - I promised I'd be nice. - So what's the problem? If Cat does anything to ruin my grand opening, we'll be talking to divorce lawyers in the morning! You heard your husband, Catalina. [ Everyone Laughing ] Lose the mustache. Why not?I've seen the way you drive. What's wrong with my driving?In this country, driving is not considered a contact sport. I'm warning you. Do not mess with me, not tonight. All right.

Don't you want to know how the grand opening went? - I'm sorry, Donald. How was your opening? - We were a hit. I'm very happy for you. Now where have you two been? Celebrating. Drinking champagne and dancing. Dancing? I thought you didn't dance. You should've seen him. I couldn't teach him a thing. You want to get critical? Let's talk about your driving.Don't start with me on that! Hey, hey, hey! If you guys are gonna fight, keep it down. - My kids are asleep. Good night. - Good night. Well, I think we've shared enough lies for one evening. I hate it when you're right. Sweet dreams, Cat.And to you, my friend. - Catalina? - Hmm? I was thinking that maybe after we get divorced, we might go out on a real date. I'll think about that. For about a year or two. [ Woman On Radio] Hey,amigos, happy Thanksgiving! It's another beautiful day in the City of Angels... with a brisk 68 degrees and mostly sunny. So put some salsa on your turkey... and give a hear on K.U.N.O., la numero uno. Eww. Ansiana, don't even think about it. That's my gravy. Mine! This is an American holiday. I'm the only one here qualified to cook it. I swear, old woman, you add so much as a pinch of anything, I'm calling immigration. Correct me if I'm wrong, but you no have-a the green card? Well, I see perhaps you are right. This is... your holidays. So, how shall I say this? You are citizenship-challenged. Donald, there's some things we don't joke about. Fine. I believe Ansiana and I have come to a new... and closer understanding of one another, haven't we? Why don't we go to the living room and watch the parade? - Parade? - Yes, there's one on television. I see! I love parades! You shouldn't be mean to her, you know.Why not? She's mean to me. You deserve it.Right. - Just be nice, okay? - [ Clears Throat ] Is this the Chandler residence? Si,and who are you? We're from the Department of Immigration. I swear to you. I did nothing to the gravy! I beg your pardon? For this, I place a curse on you, Oso. [ Muttering ] Ansiana, who's here? - Catalina Chandler? - No, she's my sister-in-law. [ Donald ] Catalina, with all my heart and soul, I hate you! I really, really hate you! [ Catalina ] If you were a man, that might bother me, Oso. But you're no man. [ Donald ] What do you think you were doing?Please, won't you come in? We'd like to speak to Mr. and Mrs. Chandler. My ties! She took my ties-- imported silk ties-- and washed them in the washing machine! It was an accident. Somehow the ties got in with the laundry. That was no accident. It was her way of getting back at me because I forgot her birthday! He cares more about the clothes than the people who wear them! Not even a card. A card! Silencio!You will stop your arguing now! These people are from the Immigration Department. Good. You saved me the phone call. I want you to take her back. - Mr. Chandler-- - She is a witch! Take her. She's yours! Thanks for coming by. I'll go pack my suitcases. [ Man ] Mrs. Chandler. We're not here to judge whether or not you're happily married. We're here to verify that you're actually living together as man and wife. Which apparently you are. [ Donald ] I'm sorry. I didn't mean what I just said. It's just my ties! I know. I'm sorry too. I'll talk to you when I get home.I'll be here. Mr. Chandler, we'd like to ask you a few questions. I'm sorry, but I have to get to work. I'm late, and I need some new ties. I'm sorry about Oso-- I mean, Donald. You don't need to apologize. Apparently you two share a very passionate relationship. I envy you. You're up late tonight.I'm trying to put together Domi's gift. Mmm. This family has been a good influence on you. I think maybe you are beginning to find your soul again. Blame it on the holidays.Would you like an eggnog? But it's the holidays! Oso, there is something I must tell you. - So tell me. - I have wronged you. Anything in particular or just in general? A few weeks ago when the immigration people came here, I thought you had sent them to take me away. I placed a curse on you. Given the situation, I don't blame you. It was a curse on you to make you face your greatest fear. It's only recently I discovered what you fear the most. You fear love. It is why you have tried to bury yourself in all of this comfort. You need it to keep you from feeling the things you cannot control. You know something, Ansiana, you would make a hell of a fortune teller. It's a gift I have. I hate to burst your bubble, but I don't believe in magic. While we're at it, I don't believe that true love exists in the real world. People who have lost their souls believe in very little. There is something else I have to tell you. Something I have told to no one else. - What is that? - I am not a true member of this family. What? It was by chance I walk into the church where Anthony was being christened. They seemed like such a nice family. Let me guess. You cast a spell and you became an instant relative? It helped. But they were too polite to ask if I was related to them. - Why are you telling me this? - I have lived with this secret for many years now. Sometimes it is good to trust another with the secrets of your heart. - And you trust me? - [ Giggling ] In many ways, you and Catalina are so much alike. Good night. Feliz Navidad. Ah. [ Phone Ringing ] Hello?Merry Christmas, Donny. Barbie!I'm throwing a little Christmas Eve thing. I was hoping, if you're not doing anything, you could come by. Sorry, Barbara, but I'm kinda tied up. Wrapping gifts. That kind of thing. Did you get me anything?Gosh, no. You're not on my list this year. You hate me, don't you?No, I don't hate you. You're not on my hate list, nor are you on my Christmas card list. You are "listless" with me. I got you a little something.You shouldn't have. Well, I did. So why don't you come over here so I can give it to you? e@Sorry, Barbie, but I've got commitments here. Feliz Navidad. Feliz Navidad? - Looking for something special? - [ Gasps ] You startled me. So, Cat, are you being naughty or nice? I haven't decided yet. [ Both Laughing ] I like your hat. So, little boy, what do you want for Christmas? That, my dear, is a very dangerous question to ask a celibate. I know. - [ Miguel ] Ho, ho, ho! - Great! Here comes Santa Claus. Feliz Navidad, Oso. Ho, ho, ho, my friend. wHumbug, amigo. [ Crowd ] Five, four, three, two, one-- [ Cheering, Chattering ] Happy New Year, my almost-husband. Happy New Year, my almost-wife. Happy New Year, Catalina.Happy New Year! Happy New Year, Donald.And to you. Can I buy you a drink?Miguel, I never drink while I'm working. You know that.Come on. We're friends. We're business partners. We gotta toast in the New Year together.Yeah. All right. Maybe one. Up to the bar. I'm buying. Happy New Year. [ Spanish ] To health, wealth, and love, my friend. Works for me. If I ever catch you kissing my sister again, it won't work well for you. It could easily cost you a restaurant. Take is easy, Miguel. I didn't kiss your sister. She kissed me. Besides, it's New Year's Eve. People kiss each other. What's the harm of that? In case you haven't noticed, Catalina's beginning to have feelings for you. You know, I'm startin' to like her a little bit too. It's a lot better than fighting all the time. No! I don't want to see her hurt again. She's been hurt enough. Hey, Miguel, I've got no argument with that. Well, good. Then you keep your relationship with her strictly business. If not, I'll be forced to take away your restaurant. Comprende? Yeah. You have a nice restaurant, Donald. Salud. This offer is good for now. But it won't be open forever. What can I say?Just say yes. Well, just say you'll think about it. I'll think about it. Donald.If it isn't Miguel and his faithful jungle guide. See, Miguel. I told you that people would make jokes. Miguel, you remember my ex-wife, Barbara. And this is her mother, Jackie. - Miguel. - Pleased to meet you. Can I talk to you for a second? Certainly. Ladies, would you please excuse me? Come on.Sure. What's this? Another business loan?Is that the fellow? Yeah. I'm thinking I'll lend Cruz the money... to start a gardening service. First-class. Complete with uniforms and everything. I don't want to be first-class. All I want to do is mow lawns and pull the weeds. Trust me on this, okay? What are they doing here?Having lunch. I can see that. I don't want to see 'em here. I'm sorry you feel that way, Miguel. - Why don't you ask them to leave? - No. That wasn't a request, Donald. That's it, Miguel. You finally crossed the line. You want to take the restaurant, you go ahead and take it. Just say the word, it's yours. I've got other offers. - We'll talk about this later. - Fine. Right now, I've got to go out and get a Valentine's gift for Cat. - That's not necessary. - Oh, I think it is. - Do you remember what happened when I forgot her birthday? - You may have a point. ♪♪ [ No Audible Dialogue ] Hey.Hey, Cat. I'm goin' out for a while.It's after 10:00! Where are you goin' at this time of night?Out! I'm feeling restless. Is that all right with you? Hey, I was just asking, okay? God! Yes, sir. Tomorrow at 8:00. [ Footsteps ] Buy a girl a drink? So what brings you here? I came to give you your Valentine's present. [ Laughs ] My Valentine's present? Me. [ Laughs ] Barbie, we still have dinner guests. Well, I suppose I'll have to settle for a drink until they leave. So, have you thought about the offer? As a matter of fact, I have. - Thanks but no thanks. - What? Why? Barbie, I've already been burned once by you and your mother. - I think once is enough. - Come on, Donald. I admit I made a small mistake. Are you gonna hold that against me forever? It wasn't a small mistake. It was a pretty big one. But you know something? You kinda did me a favor. Here you go. One cosmo, up, on the house. Mmm! You do know what a girl likes. It's gonna be different this time, darling. Even Mother approves now. You really impressed her. I impressed your mother? Indeed you did. You've made a success of yourself here. But what really impressed her the most... was that you actually married that Mexican woman to make it all happen. It's amazing what a desperate man will do. Well, you don't have to be desperate any longer. Or lonely, Donald. You've paid your dues. It's time to come back to the real world... and say adios to that third-world family. DpYou're not gonna find a better offer. Not to mention the perks. Whoa! Barbie, just--Donald, give me a kiss. Come on! Stop it. Stop it! Oh, yes, Donald! [ Laughs ] Barbie! [ Barbara ] Come here. Gimme a kiss. Don-- Uh, I'll come back later. I'm not playing.I'm not listening to you. No, no. You can't do that. That's a guy thing. Then what can I do for you? Why don't you... take a taxi home--And then? You wait for me.[ Laughs ] You better not keep me waiting long. [ Growls, Giggles ] [ Sighs ] What happened between you and my sister last night? What are you talking about?Catalina has gone back to Mexico. She what?Don't play innocent with me, Donald! - What'd you do to her? - I don't know what you're talking about. - I-I didn't do anything. - Oh, okay. That explains everything. - She left because you didn't do nothin'. - Exactly. Here. She left this letter for you. "Oso, I'm not sure which one of us is the bigger fool, you or me. "Somehow, we began to have feelings for each other. "We may have danced to the same song but we heard different lyrics. "Now the dance is over. It's time to go back to our own separate worlds. My world is in Mexico." She came to the restaurant last night. Why? What happened there? My ex-wife, Barbara. She came by to give me a very special Valentine's present. You know, a "real good time." - I think he's talking about having sex. - [ Spanish ] Hey! -I want you two to go to the kitchen and eat your breakfast. -Nobody's made breakfast. If you're old enough to talk about sex, you're old enough to make your own breakfast. Ay!It's all your fault. So, you've been messing around on my sister. No. And while we're on the subject, it's none of your damn business. You told me to stay away from your sister. I did. Now you're telling me I can't see other women. Let me tell you something. I never agreed to become a priest. The bottom line is, nothing happened last night. Then why did Catalina leave, Donald? Apparently, she didn't stick around for the part where I said no. Miguel, let Oso get dressed. I will make some coffee and then we can sit down and discuss this like adults. Hmm? [ Spanish ] Get dressed. There's nothin' left to discuss. I will go to Catalina and talk some sense into her. No offense, Miguel. I think it might be better if I went. No! You've already caused enough problems in this family. Donald is right. He is the reason Catalina left. He should be the one to bring her back. No! I no longer trust this man. He seduced my sister. I never touched her, Miguel. Don't get technical with me, Donald. We had a business agreement. Nobody was supposed to feel anything. But that wasn't good enough for you, was it? You had to make her f-feel things. You planned this all along. Ay! Only fools plan to fall in love. Oh, it's true. Donald can be a very foolish man. But he did not plan this. If anyone is to be blamed, it is me. I placed a curse on him. Don't blame Broom Hilda here. If anyone's to blame, it's you. - My fault? - Yes, you and your family. For reasons that defy all logic, I've actually come to like having you around. You're almost like a family to me. And your sister, Catalina, is a big part of that. - We're not your family, Donald. - We are all family. Miguel, why would it be so bad if Donald and Catalina have truly fallen in love? I'll tell you, baby. As a businessman, Donald's got my respect. Fine. I don't think he's the kind of man I want my sister to marry. I hate to point this out, Miguel. You know what I mean. Married in the eyes of God. As a true man and wife by a priest. Why would it be so bad if they did become a real man and wife? Because this man's got no honor! He married for money. There's nothin' left to discuss! I'm going to Mexico. - No, Miguel. I forbid you to go. - You forbid me? Yes, Miguel, I forbid you. You have been playing el patrón with all of our friends. Dictating how they should live their lives and run their businesses and I said nada. But no longer. This is our family. Familia. And I will not keep quiet. I forbid you to dictate to them who they should and should not love. - Juanita, y-- - [ Spanish ] I'm sorry, Catalina, but I have no work I can offer you. It's the slow time of the year. I understand, don Carlos. Maybe in a month or two when the tourists start to come back. You'll be the first person I'll hire. I promise you that. Thank you, don Carlos. In the meantime, you need a little money? Oh, no. I'm okay. Thank you. I'm sorry things didn't work for you in the United States. But we're happy that you're back. It's good to be back. Tobias, here are the keys. Thanks for filling in for me. Just try not to burn it down.That's Miguel's job. Uncle Oso, will you bring me back a present? - How about I bring back your favorite aunt? - Okay. Tell you what I'll do. I'll have your Aunt Cat pick out both of you something special. - Okay? Wish me luck. - [ Together ] Good luck. Oh, Donald? If you truly wish to bring Catalina back, you will have to face your fear. You must listen to the music in your heart. It will keep you honest with yourself. Do not forget what I've said. I won't. We'll be back soon. Bye.Bye. Here you go, señor. Keep it.Outside. Here? I hope you enjoy your stay with us, Señor Chandler. Thank you. Have you by chance seen this woman? I understand she used to work here. Catalina. Of course I know her. But she moved to the United States to get married. I know. I'm the guy she married. Oh.If you happen to see her, would you let me know?Oh, Señor Chandler, please. Keep your money. Catalina has always been like a little sister to me. uI promise you that I will watch out for her. Thank you. What? Do you really think of Catalina as your little sister? She's more, uh, like a cousin. A distant cousin. [ Laughs ] Por qué,boss. Why didn't you tell Mr. Chandler that Catalina was here? Rule number two.Ah! Uh-- What's rule number two? Now listen to me, young man. Rule number two is one of the most important rules in managing a hotel. Never ever become involved in another man's womans problems. It can be a pit filled with deadly snakes. Oh, so what's rule number one then? [ Sighs ] Unless you're asked, never ever let the wife know that the husband stay here in this hotel. Oh. So then we shouldn't call Catalina to tell her that Mr. Chandler is looking for her. Bingo! Do you have a hotel phone I can use?Please. Be my guest. Yeah, hi, Juanita. It's me. Have you heard from Cat? Yeah, okay. Please call me if you hear from her, okay? Yeah. I'll do the same. Bye. Thank you.[ Spanish ] So, you have come here for business or for pleasure? I'm looking for a woman. Ah, then it is for pleasure. The woman is my wife.Ah. Then it is none of my business. Have you by chance seen this woman? It would be hard to forget such a beautiful woman. But I am sorry, I can tell you nothing. ♪ I don't know why ♪ You should cry ♪ 'Cause you know that for you, I'd die ♪ ♪ In my sleep when you weep ♪ ♪ 'Cause there's nothin' that I wouldn't do ♪ ♪ For you ♪ You know that there is nothin' I won't do ♪ ♪ For you ♪ You know that you are everything to me ♪ ♪♪ [ Spanish ] Señora?Sí. [ Spanish ] Gracias. Hola.Hola. Amigo? [ Spanish ] Gracias. [ Sighs ] Hi!Hi. Do you have any rooms available? For a beautiful woman as you-- How could I say no? I'll take the best you have. Will you be staying alone, or-- will someone join you? Well, that all depends. I'm looking for my husband. Oh? By any chance, have you seen this man? Are you married to this man? His name is Donald Chandler. He checked in with us yesterday. In that case, I won't be needing a room after all. Do you have an extra key to his room? Of course. It's bungalow 103 and it's located at the far side of the pool. Thank you. Oh! Wake up, boss.[ Spanish ] Why did you tell her about her husband? She asked. Perhaps we should call Catalina. What about the rules? When a man has two wives, the rules no longer apply. This is quaint. Looking for a good time, sailor? - What are you doing here? - I was hungry. I thought I'd have dinner. I meant, what are you doing in Mexico? I called your restaurant. Talked to some guy Tobias. He told me I could find you here. Aren't you gonna ask me to sit down? No, I'm not. I want you to go away. Cat left me because she saw the two of us together the other night. I need to explain to her what didn't happen. Your being here isn't helping me.Really, Donald. .Don't you think you've taken this joke far enough? Barbara, listen to me. This is not a joke. Catalina's become a very important part of my life. [ Laughs ] You can't be serious! You and her? Yes. Me and her. Believe it or not, I even like her family. [ Gasps ] You poor man. They've brainwashed you. This is gonna get very ugly. So this is why you had to come down here? If you're trying to make me jealous, it won't work. Just go home! And take her with you.Cat, this isn't how it looks. She followed me here.Well, good for her. She can have you. That's not what I want.You don't know what you want. I can't help you with that. Just go home. Go back to where you belong. - See, even she knows what's best for you. - I'm not leaving without you. If you're worried about losing your precious little restaurant, don't be. I'll see that Miguel lets you keep it. I'm not here because of the restaurant. I'm here for you.I saw you two the other night. I heard what you were saying. Well, you should've stuck around for the part where I said no. Nothing happened. I saw the two of you kissing. She attacked me. I-I was an innocent bystander. .- Noting happened. - Nothing? - I wasn't even tempted. - Really? Don't be silly. With what I was wearing, he had to be tempted. Yeah, but nothing happened! It doesn't matter anyway. The only reason you want me back is because I left you. I know the way you think, Oso. - She's right. - Would you stop agreeing with me! ,- It's really starting to piss me off! - How very rude! Rude? I don't think so. So far, I've been very polite in this whole thing. - You don't wanna see rude, gringa. - Ladies-- - Are you threatening me? - Ladies-- [ Together ] What! Before the catfight gets into full swing here, can I just say something? I've been trying really hard to talk to both of you, but neither of you wants to listen to what I have to say. So here it is, one last time. Barbara, I want you to go home. Catalina, I want you to come home. I'm flying home tomorrow. If you have any feelings for me at all, please talk to me before I go. Have a pleasant evening. You handled it very well. How can you say that? No injuries.The evening's still young. You know what your problem is, Oso? No, but I have a feeling you're about to tell me. You don't know what you want.I think I do. No.I know that I need you, Cat. If you want me to, I'll beg. I don't want you to beg. Well, you could beg a little. Please, come with me. Please! Please! Please! No.Can we at least talk about it? That depends on what you have to say. We're just good together, Cat.That's not good enough. Tell me what it is you want. No, Oso. You tell me what you want. I just know that we belong together. No. This is where I belong. It's a simple life, but it's my home. You should go back to where you belong. Your fancy cars, your expensive clothes, your big house. Let me get one thing clear. The big house, the expensive clothes, the fancy cars, they're-- Well, they're still great. Look. None of that matters if it means I'm gonna lose you. Oso, if you really mean that, why didn't you do something before? Before I left?I was afraid. - You were afraid? - This scares the hell out of me. I'm used to being in control, and all of this has gotten way out of control. There's one thing I do know. I am in love with you. Of course you are. [ Giggles ] [ Spanish ] Señora Chandler, good news. There was a seat available, and I took the liberty of reserving it for you. Thank you.Señora Chandler-- It's a shame that a beautiful woman as you... cannot spend more time here with us. Oh. Mamacita. Yeah, to say the love word.Um, no. No?No. Why?Well, if I said I loved you, then we'd end up-- And?And Miguel would take away your restaurant. True. Your ex-wife won't give you any money for a new restaurant. Listen, Cat, I know I'll probably lose everything I used to think was important, b-but I don't care about that anymore. I will mow lawns for a living if it means coming home to you. Whoa! Oso, I still can't trust you. Catalina, trust me, please. Listen to the music of your heart. Oh, I can hear the music to my heart, but... the music to your heart might change in the morning. Just do me one small favor. Just come back to my bungalow with me. - Is sex the only thing you can think of? - No! I-It's pretty high on my list but that's not why I want you to come back. - I bought you a present. - Ah! So now you think you can bribe me. Something like that. You coming? Hmm, yes. But we'll keep the door open. Oh, Donald. [ Chuckling ] So what's this gift you wanna give me? Well, it's a surprise. Surprise! - That wasn't the surprise I had in mind. - You're a very sick man. I don't know how to explain what just happened in there. I don't think I can. All I want to say is just trust me.Trust you? If you care about me at all just trust me, please. Give me one good reason why I should. I'll give you two. I'm in love with you.And two? I haven't given you your present yet.Better be a damn good one. Oh, you're gonna like it. Just give me two minutes with her. I give you one minute and my clock is ticking. Thank you. Oh, Donald. You almost had me fooled. Then I found the wedding dress. And somehow you figured the dress was for you? Well, you are already married to that Mexican woman. The only thing I can't figure out is... what made you so sure I'd follow you here? Uh--Oh! Barbie, why don't we slip you out of this dress, and we'll have a nice little chat. You want me to take off the dress? More than you could ever guess. [ Chuckles ] That's what you want.Yes, that's what I want. - Time's up. - ♪ Do, do - [ Screams ] - [ Ripping Sound ] Donald, what are you doing? Donald! You do remember how to swim, don't you, Barbie? You wouldn't dare!Watch me. [ Screams ] [ Laughs ] I'm beginning to like that man. Come. Stay.I'm just leaving the door open. Don't. Our friend out there might consider it an invitation. Oh! I hate this place! Here. This is the first part of your present. Shoes. You got me new shoes. They were supposed to go... with this. Barbara was taking too long so I kind of had to rip it off her. Well, it can be fixed, but-- This is a wedding dress. I know. You wanna get married? [ Laughs ] We're already married. I mean, really married. In the eyes of God, in a church, by a priest. Come on, Cat. Make me an honest man. Oh, Donald, I don't know. This is so sudden and-- What are you talking about? We've been walking down the aisle since we said "I do." No, but Miguel-- Forget about Miguel. This is about you and me. You really do love me, don't you? I love you too. You just said the love word.I know. They're here! Gracias.[ Spanish ] Aunt Catalina!Hey! Oh! Come here, little man.Oh, I missed you. I will never forgive you for not letting me give Catalina away. Would you have given her to me? Probably not. Welcome to the family, Donald. I'm so happy for the both of you! Just wish that Miguel wasn't so upset with us. Miguel-- I'm only angry at myself. I've been a fool playing dictator with the people I care about. I hope you guys will forgive me. Apology accepted. I don't suppose this means, uh, I can keep my restaurant? Sorry, Donald. I've already given the papers to the new owner. I didn't think so. Are we gonna stay out here all day or what? Huh? I'll get your bags.[ Spanish ] [ Laughs ] Hey, Miguel. Donald and I will be staying in the same bedroom now. I know. I know. But first, there's something I gotta show you. It's a surprise.Surprise? Come on. You'll see. Come on, you guys!Come on. Surprise! [ Chattering ] The first wedding reception was for Catalina. This is for the both of you. And I have a very special wedding present for you, Catalina.
