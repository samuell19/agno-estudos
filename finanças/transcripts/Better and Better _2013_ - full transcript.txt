越来越好之村晚 BETTER AND BETTER Open the doors to prosperity. Joy to the heavens. Joy to the earth. Joy to the south north, west, and east! Joy to you. Joy to me. We are all full of joy, because the door to prosperity was opened today. Teacher Yang! You're Agent Yang, right? Here have a smoke. And you are? I am Sun Xiangcheng, head of this fan club, the most professional fan club in the whole country! Wait, teacher Yang! Listen to me! We can do all kinds of things to support a star. If the price is reasonable, we can do things that others simply cannot do! Are you kidding me? Wang Peng is an acrobat. I doubt this way of thinking will help your client. You know Liu Qian, the magician? He became popular after his show in the Spring Festival Gala. This review is a chance for Wang Peng to show himself. Wang Peng will definitely pass with the help of our fan group! PENGPENG, WE SUPPORT YOU. One, two, three, hurray! Run! Get out! Stay away from here! Out of my sight! Hey! Hi! Hello, Miss young and beautiful village director! I have something to tell you. What is it? Are we going to have a Spring Festival Gala this year? Let me take it off your hands and I'll manage it best! With just a little praise, you've become so cocky! I'm not cocky, I really can do it. My only intention is for everyone to have fun. Nothing else! OK. As you wish! Hey, you, the youngest one! Hello, mom, what's up? Hello, Xiangcheng! This year our village is going to have a Spring Festival Gala. There's no impressive show on the list. They're not taking it very seriously. You are a professional. Could you come back and help them? OK, I'll be back soon! Hey, man, I have to quit! I'm going back to my hometown, to work on the Spring Festival Gala. Xiangcheng, for the CCTV Spring Festival Gala? Really? No, it's not the CCTV Spring Festival Gala. It's our village show. You know, as the greatest dancer in our village you should come too! - Let's go! - Wait! Do you have any money? Of course! How much? Lend me three thousand! For what? I haven't gotten paid for our last job. These people follow me now. I have to pay them for the holiday season. Lend me some money so I can clear it out before the new year. Then what will I do if I lend you the money? Don't move! Wait! - Defa, what's wrong? - That man owes me money! Don't move! My wages! Don't move! Hello. Hello. Why do you want to be a chef in this restaurant? I saw it on t.v. A Bite of China It introduces all kinds of food, a lot of tasty food. My hometown has a lot of tasty food and I want to show it to Beijing. Where did you graduate from? I learned how to cook from my grandma. Our junior chefs have all graduated from two major universities. Blue Ribbon and Blue Flight. You have to go to school to learn how to cook? You drank way too much! Look at all this puke, you've overdone it! Come on. You are too kind! What's this for? I don't need your money. You drank too much and now you're drunk. No, boss. There's no need, really! Is this amount not enough? It's not enough, right? - Here! This golden chain... - Don't take it off! is 62 ounces! Put it on! I'm just a janitor, I'm not worthy of this! Hey man, it's me! What's wrong with your face? My wife gave me these scratches. Can you give me back the stuff I gave to you yesterday? All the money in my wallet was used for pretending to be a wealthy man. My... my 62 ounce gold chain is fake and I'll leave that to you. Just give me back all the other stuff. Hey, man. If you don't give it back, I will be beaten to death by my wife tonight. I am begging you! I am begging you...beaten to death! Hey man, it's OK! She will beat me to death. VIRTUOUS MAN, GENEROUS IN MONEY MATTERS. This is your reward. You've given us a good reputation. No reward is needed, I just want to work in the kitchen. Are you tired of being a janitor? No, it's just my dream to become a chef. OK, your dream has come true! Thank you, manager! Read my lips, What you manage is a village gala. V-I-L-L-A-G-E. What CCTV manages is T-H-E Spring Festival Gala. They are not the same. Don't claim that credit for yourself. That's not important. Bro, you are a major agent. Please help me invite the superstar, Liu, to attend our village show. I'm not trying to look down on you. It's just that you're managing a village show; a dog could host that. Bro, you are killing my reputation. No, I'm afraid of killing the dog's reputation. Let's speak frankly. The village show has a good cast. Do you know Ziyi? Yeah, the international superstar, Zhang Ziyi, my closest friend. Once she found out about the show, she's been calling me everyday. She wants to perform in it. Stop tooting your own horn. You don't believe me? I'll call her right now. Hey Ziyi, it's Xiangcheng. Nothing special, I'm in a coffee shop with my friend. I told him you would perform in our show. He doesn't buy it. You talk to him and tell him. What? You don't want to talk to a stranger? OK, got it! Hey, Ziyi, you... try not to eat so much kidney. They aren't that good for your health. Thank you for reminding me! I won't eat any more high cholesterol food. EVENING GALA DIRECTOR'S VEHICLE I've got some good stuff! Wait! Wait! Don't push! Don't push! Xiangcheng, mom is here! Everyone gets one! Xiangcheng, mom is here! Mom! Don't try to squeeze through! I'll throw one to you. - Hey, here. - A hat with a star's signature! Give me! More stuff! Guys! Don't push! Everyone gets one! Old Geng! My idol's hat. Draw me well! Whatever you draw will be a poster in my son's village show. Yuan Fang! What's your opinion? My opinion? Don't let Shan Xi sweat over it. I've called Xiangcheng back. Let him do it! He is a professional. You can't let him intervene! He doesn't know how to deal with Shan Xi. Wait, what are you drawing? My feet are all numb! You don't know chalk from cheese! I drew you like the American cowboy. What are these drawings? The colors are a mess! You fool! Can't you tell it's our village? There's too many colors, it doesn't match its object. Too many colors? So what? I want to live in a village with many different colors; like a fairy tale. So beautiful! Get back to standing over there and stay still! Stay still! A little further, that's it. - Ah! - Further! Fukua! Fukua! What happened to you? Your Highness, Your Highness, Your... You're making fun of me. Huan Huan, only you know me. I only wish for the emperor's heart, till death do us part. Huan Huan. Look at these fair mountains, fair waters, and beautiful atmosphere. Are you happy? Your Highness, my family name is Yuan. Ah! Shan Xi! Do you remember Geng Zhi? He's been nominated for an HNB Literature Award online. Look! Here! Geng Zhi. It's real! Youth writer Geng Zhi is nominated for an HNB literature award. If Geng Zhi could be the script writer of my village's show, the show would be exalted to an even higher level. FANS' SUPPORT FOR TALENTED ACHIEVEMENTS. LITERATURE AWARDS Yeah! Yeah! Er Dan! What are you doing? Dad. By your grandma's heels, why didn't you tell us about your nomination? I haven't won an award yet. How come you are here? We've come to pick you up and take you back. Oh! Don't get cold. Hello! Darling. You were deceived. You fool! Diao used to make fake websites. He didn't have any overseas relationship or know any panel member. He made a fake web page for your 30 grand. He is a cheater. Hurry up! Get changed! Let's go home! I can't go home right now, they'll know it's fake. I will be disgraced. What's up? Now that you're famous, you want your dad to kneel down and beg you? Even though you won a foreign award and became a foreigner, you are still a son of a farmer. It's our roots! It's just a nomination, it doesn't mean I won an award. You... Shan Xi, what do you think? Bro. What are you going to do? Welcome! Welcome! Welcome home! Louder! It was hard to make ends meet since you have loved writing. I am not a banker or an owner of a gold mine. There wasn't any money for a while. I depended on other people when you're weren't here. I've kept an account. Thinking of paying it back one day. The first snow of 2003 Bao Fung gave me three basket of eggs and twenty dollars. April 26th, Guang Sun gave me some sheep offal. I sold it at the market and got 140 dollars. May 5th, Lian Sheng gave me two hundred dollars in cash. I can't read any more. You are experienced now! Remember, while drinking, you... Hey, my uncle is the best! What do you mean the best! You always tell him that. I have to congratulate my uncle for winning an award. Congratulations! Win a big prize! Ya! Thank him with it. - With what? - This. Oh, I can't do that! Hurry, closer. Not enough! What's that? That one? The kid's grandma and I have a very good relationship. Ah! His grandma is going to be my step mom? Then I am going to be your step uncle. Come, take this and buy some candy! Thank you, uncle! Thank you, uncle! Call me step uncle! Thank you, step uncle! Why did you only give him money and not me? Is it because your dad likes his grandma? I have a grandma! OK, money! There you go! The winner is giving all his money away! Are you step grandpa to all the kids here? How many grandmas are there in our village? All gone! What are you doing? I still have some money. That will be enough. I don't want it. Two copies, two. Come on! Hurry up! A PHOTO WITH ER DAN 10 YUAN, WITH HIS FATHER 5 YUAN Take a picture! See... Sign it! - Dad! - Let me sign it. I can't feel my hands! What's that? Er Dan, two eggs. Dad, I am begging you. Give me a break! What are you doing? On grandma's heels! You just don't want me to bask in your glory. It's not that, it's just the award... Cut the crap! It's a business... It does not... I found it! You found it! Geng Zhi's book. Steel Gate Doesn't it mean "butt" too? Look at that. Full of humor and wit. Because of his pen, a butt also has significance. Fortune! Cabbage! Cabbage! Cabbage! Cabbage! Shan Xi, what is this for? Wages. What wages? For the script of our village's New Year's Eve Gala. About the script project, I haven't fully accepted. Plus this, and this. Are these enough? I wasn't always guaranteed payment after my work. Sometimes I had to pay myself. No need to pay in advance. This is my respect for a great writer. Bro, this little amount of money isn't even enough for you. Talking about money insults our bond. Bro. OK, let's talk about our feelings. Last year, there was a big flood in our village. My factory was flooded immediately. I was a wreck. At that very moment, each and every family, young and old, all came out and helped me dig out the factory stock piece by piece. If it wasn't for them, my factory would've been done for. - I didn't know about that! - You see. What I want to give them is a village show. They can gather together cheerfully and enjoy a wonderful New Year's Eve. Then my debt is repaid. What do you think? - I'm a man of the heart. - That you are! You can count on me. I won't charge a penny. Oh, Bro! You are a true man of the heart! You are a man of passion. You are a good role model to others. You are a modern day Robin Hood. You are a timely rain! How about this? I want to hit the gongs for you. Dang Dang Dang... I want to beat the drums for you. Dang Dang Dang... - You flatter me! - I don't know how to thank you. You don't charge a penny. Bro, how about this? You rest and finish the script. Then I will do all the promotional work. I will make the greatest effort to promote your work. I will pitch you as the same as the Nobel prize winner Mo Yan. I will help you make a name for yourself. THE HOMETOWN OF CHINESE LITERATUR Geng Zhi Elementary School Writing is like a woman in childbirth. Dad, I'm drawing a blank here. Where is my inspiration? If there's no inspiration, you should take a break. Go outside and take a walk, breathe in the fresh air of the mountain, drink some spring water, and meet some villagers. I love you! We love you too! I love you! We love you too! I love you! We love you too! We love you too! We love you too! I love you! I love you! We love you too! We love you too! This is truly living. Elements of happiness... Done! Geng Zhi, Geng Zhi! Lian Sheng is here! Come on! The script is done! - You'll be very satisfied. - Let's do it later! Let's go to the awards first. - You are going to win the award! - Award? It's a big event! Er Dan, what's wrong with you? Dad! What's going on? What's wrong with you? Dad. About the award... Dad... I was deceived. Unveil it! HNB LITERATURE AWARD ZERO DAYS LEFT TO AWARD ANNOUNCEMENT You should have told me earlier! I brought you back home! Slow down, don't fall! - This problem can't be solved now. - Slowly! I have received gifts from the people. We'll lose face! Lose face! We'll be so humiliated! And embarrassed! Run away! Leave here! Hurry, go! Hey, bro and uncle... still working? Be careful and stay low. Come on down, hurry! The Awards Ceremony is about to start. Bro Geng, Uncle Geng. Teacher Geng! The ceremony is about to start! Say something for us! I can't contain myself. I won't go! Are you really living the life? Living the life? I want to leave that life behind. - Wait, wait! - Why should I attend this ceremony? Don't push me! Don't push me! Come on! Move! Go! Come here and sit down! Welcome! Welcome! Welcome! Welcome! Welcome! Welcome! Welcome! Welcome! Welcome! Welcome! Welcome! Welcome! It's starting! Get back, get back! Everyone calm down! The news is about to start! Breaking news now. The HNB Literature Award winner is... Who is setting off firecrackers? I can't hear anything! It's not a wedding! Stop rushing it! Congratulations to the winner... On other breaking news... What's going on? What happened? Who is that winner? What's going on? Not Er Dan? What's going on? The T.V.'s broken? Who is the winner? What is going on? Why aren't you on it, Er Dan? My dear townspeople, I am sorry! I am sorry! Maybe I'm not a writer after all. You published so many books, how could you not be the winner? My books... Steel Gate Blue Skin Actually... they are all self-published. Self-published? Let me give you a suggestion. Don't write empty topics next time, find something more real, like our village, there are many topics about our lives. I will pay for it. No more imagination. I quit! I won't write anymore. Are you from our village? You're quiting because of this little thing? You have to keep writing! Uncle, you've lived frugally for a decade in a big city, we all admire you. You have to keep writing! No matter what happens, you are the one who dares to dream and makes his dreams come true. Keep doing it, we all stand by you! Yes, we will stand by you, support you and pay for you. Thank you, everyone! Thank you for your love. I am ashamed to face each of you. I am leaving. Don't let me look down on you! - Don't leave! - Don't leave, Uncle Er Dan! Er Dan! Where are you going? Dad, I packed up my stuff and I'm leaving for town. Er Dan. Don't leave, OK? I am getting older. I don't know much about literature. But here's my only advice if you want it! I have limited knowledge. You don't have to stay in a city to write. The pressure is too great because of all the writers in the city. You could stay in your hometown and write a script for our village show. Stay home and spend the New Year with all of us. You could write a great script for our New Year's Eve Gala show, right? Er Dan! I knew even when I was a child that you are definitely the best writer in the world. This is a composition from your childhood. I've kept it in my collection. I relate to this article completely. It was deeply touching. My Hometown My hometown is a village that sits on a mountain. The people here live in stone houses from the days of our fathers. There are small yards in front of the houses and the houses are surrounded by walls made of stone plates, layer by layer. There are many stories about this place that I can tell you. The persimmon trees all over are the best during the cold days. The fruits hang all over the trees and lighten the hill. The orange yellow spots on the valley seem to belong to heaven. Folks love to make persimmon cakes. They air dry them in their yards. And bask them in the sun on the roofs. Take one piece and bite it, it's sweet to the soul. A stone mill sits in the center of the village and makes flour which mom uses to make steamed bread. It tastes delicious. The night side cliff of the village has a large terrace on its side, and a winding path leads to the other side. They say the other side is different from here. But my dad says our ancient roots are in this mountain. I love my hometown. When I grow up, I want to be a writer and write my hometown in my book, and let everyone see what she looks like. Xiangcheng has too much money. He bought his mom a wolf. Not a wolf, it's a Husky. Oh, an overseas wolf. It's trendy nowadays. A rich man won't leave his house without having a wolf now. Show off! A mom with cosmetic surgery has a wolf. That makes me unhappy. Do you know why his mom looks like that? To show I am out of fashion, right? I can keep up with fashion. I can. Just wait and see! I have better taste and I'll show him what I can do. I will bring him down. Hey, look! Shan Xi's family is rich too. Bought his father a panda. Money isn't the only important thing, people matter too. Hey! Where did your son buy the panda? He has a long tail! What panda? Shan Xi dyed the dog's hair. It's all about humiliation. Contact code? Is it a male or female dog? It's female. Mine is male. Correct! Comrade Yuan Fang, hello. Upon observation, the coast is clear. Let's cut a long story short. Shang Xi is green with envy lately. Shang Xi worries what Xiangcheng does will outshine his village show. I can't explain it. I think you shouldn't be out and about. I can't go outside? Forget it! I can't go outside either! Don't you miss me? I miss you! I will call you when I miss you. If your son knows, won't he think my son is going to sway you toward our side? And switch sides in the fight? Don't be silly! I will call you at 10 o'clock everyday. We'll both keep silent and count to ten. Thinking of each other is enough for us. The phrases you used are very good! But we need good programs too. I'm working on it. I am a professional when it comes to making good programs. I already have good ideas. We'll make a "Voice of the Village" Program. My aunt's daughter is a good singer. She'll be selected. That's a good idea! That way we can show off all of our talented villagers in the show. We need one more dancer. - Do you remember Xie Defa? - Who is Xie Defa? The one who always sang Endless Love to You in our village . With the mushroom-shaped head? Yes, the silly one. Didn't he divorce his wife? Is he in a good mood to dance? He still in contact with his ex-wife, Liu Shufen. He's had some decorating jobs. Xie Defa is rich now. - Could you get him back? - A piece of cake! To you, love, love, endless love... Chinese style tongue twister Chinese style tongue twister Welcome folks to our "Voice of the Village"! Our judges are ready! And now! The first competitor! A beautiful and persistent dreamer, The Spice Girl! While my heart's still beating, rocking with the rhythm. Blood needs a temperature, who can make it burn? Rays of light from Leo, you dare not meet my glance. People said I'm crazy, I said I am a mountain! You appear in the dark, just like a lightning bolt. Words no one knows, only I understand. Get rid of gravity you are the only one! Stars all over the sky I see you at a glance. Oh baby! My love is about to explode. I wanna give you... I wanna give you the power of love. You will be on fire! I wanna give you... Jump into the middle of the floor! With all my heart I want you to know. I wanna give you all the power of love. Mr. Ha and Momo Wu find happiness together! Never admit defeat in this big world! Even at the end of world they wanna keep playing. Mom! I want to introduce someone to you! This is my mom. This is Uncle Wang. - Uncle Wang! My home is your home! - OK! What is this? Nothing! You guys just chat! Let me introduce myself. About myself, my favorite thing in the world is art. I've come for your village show! Let's chat for a bit! Ah! Why aren't you talking? - Is there a man there? - Ah! Oh, the telephone is broken. I can fix it. Hello, hello! - Who's this? - Who's this? Who is this? Hey, a pervert is calling! I'm telling you she is not alone any more! I am protecting her now! You pervert! You! Who was that? My son! Yuan Fang, don't worry! I handled it for you! I want you to go away! Ah, Uncle Geng! - Where are you going? - I'm going to see your mom! It's not a good time! Not a good time? It'll be better once I get in there. I'll protect you! Don't be afraid! - What are you doing? - What are you afraid of? You're holding hands huh? I'm a patrolman. You two continue. Fu Gui, you got it all wrong. - Kid! - Ah! If you are capable, you must find me a companion! Only one condition, they must be better than Mrs. Sun. You're signing your own death warrant! Welcome to "If You are the One" I am the host, Geng Shan Xi. Now, welcome our 24 female single adults. Welcome to the stage! Each lady turn on your light! Now, welcome our male guest! Look here! Old but vigorous! He's over the hill! Everyone, oh! Is it the wind? - All lights went out, why? - All went out, how could we keep going? He's too much! We wouldn't keep the light on for that, right ladies? Right! What? That's my Dad! Who? Whose dad? - My dad! - Oh, my goodness! This is a lifetime thing! - We can't force our love for you! - That's it! Forced love doesn't last! Great, old Geng! You got a lot of attention! Gather a group of old ladies! One man may steal a horse, while another may not look over a hedge. Hey, old Geng! Look closely. All of our lights are out. Shan Xi! You said this was all for the villagers. Is this for the villagers or for your dad? What's wrong with doing something for my dad? You always want to invite big stars. Which one have you actually invited? I'll give you that one. If there aren't any stars, how can you "give me that one"? - You surrender! - You surrender! Mom! Don't get me started! Getting a big cast is no big deal! I'm going to Beijing to invite them! Freeze! You! Freeze! Freeze! Xie Defa! Freeze! Ah! Ah! Freeze! Defa! Defa! - Xie Defa! - You can't go in there! You are not supposed to be here now! As soon as you see me, you run! I thought you ran because of owing me three thousand. But based on our relationship you wouldn't run away from me, and I wouldn't chase you for that tiny amount. That son of a bitch owes me money! He's living in that district. After that long run the guy still hasn't repaid you? Ah, hey! That's your ex-wife, Liu Shufen? What a coincidence! After so many years you still see her here. Go talk to her! Take her home for New Year to join our village show. If you could get the money back, you would have both beauty and money! Shufen! Shufen! I've been looking for you! Who are you? Shufen, please, stop joking around! - Shufen, can we talk? - I'm not kidding! You lose your gamble again? Are you out of money again? I quit gambling! I've heard that before! Xie Defa, please have some dignity. We're not in a relationship anymore. Shufen! We've been close for so many years. Not any more to me! My feelings have been destroyed by a loser! It's not like that! That's not true! OK, I know you want money, right? Here! Don't bother me any more! Don't just surf the Internet! Do something to help me get Shufen back! Don't push me! I'm buying equipment to help you get Shufen back. Look at this! Here, here! - This one, that's good! - Wow! Is this OK? Xiangcheng. Dressing me up like this! These pants are tight and make me have to pee! - Then hold it! - What? Is this OK? Yes, not just OK. I'll tell her you don't gamble any more, that you're a president of an enterprise. The house you decorated is what you purchased to live with her. You are going to take her to Macao to watch the big water dance performance. Hey! But I feel Shufen is avoiding me. What if it's true, what am I going to do then? You have me! At least let me ask Shufen out on a date for you! Hey! Boss! It's the three million dollar purchase order! You should take it. Because of your honesty, bravery, kindness and generosity, we will lose money. Business is business! Personal feelings shouldn't be involved. Excuse me! I need to answer this. Hello! President Liu! Haven't I told you? Three million dollars. It's not about the money. If we are truly brothers, you keep the money and spend it yourself. What? President Wang's private airplane needs another gear? OK! He can use mine temporarily. My private airplane has that gear. Once you hit the clutch, it is on! He really is from our village! Give him a ladder, and he'll jump for a plane! He is so talented. A couple days ago, Mr. Jobs passed by, we became sworn brothers after a couple of drinks. He told me to ask him if I had any issues in the U.S. This Jobs is weak. When in Rome, do as the Romans do. OK, that's enough. I need to hang up! Bye! Look at this curtain! What an awful color! Replace it! Replace it! These titles! Are you decorating a living room or a bathroom? - Replace it with a wooden floor. - What are you doing? Are you crazy? OK! Oh, no. I like how that looks. I was just knocking on it to see if it is strong enough. Not stronger than this ax. I used to hear people say "unbearably vulgar", and I didn't know what it meant. Now I see this ceiling and I understand it completely. Unbearably vulgar! Unbearably vulgar! For this wall, blue would be better! Go! Wow, ha, ha, ha! Blue is better! How about that! Satisfied? I meant you are an idiot. Really silly! You are ridiculous. - How are you? Teacher Yang! - It's you again. I haven't forgotten about the last event. I have a new program right now. I want to invite stars that you represent to our village show. They will be paid according to market prices! No friendly prices, no discount! Only two days of the New Year! Only two days! Not even two minutes! No! You have to know your limitations. Teacher Wu is too important! - A big cast! With stars! - Yes. He was invited to Macao last time. Five star hotel, great food and drink, with a water dance show! The world's first class water performance! You are in a village! That's enough! - Are you both leaving? - I have to leave! It is the end of the world! I have to stay with my wife. And you? Me? I am going to walk along the sea. I haven't seen it since I was born. Xiangcheng! - Do you have any wishes? - My wish? My wish is to talk to Zhang Ziyi, my goddess and my idol, before the end of the world. Don't be silly! It's impossible without a miracle! Wait! Wait! It's a miracle! Goddess! Goddess! Goddess! Goddess! Wait for me! Wait for me! Goddess! Hi, it's you again! He wants to talk to you! Then go ahead, aren't you a very capable talker? This is... my telephone number. The end of the world is a hot topic in recent times. According to the Maya calendar, our existing world has five cycles. These cycles have five destroy and reborn periods, and December 21st 2012, is the last day of the last cycle. I LOVE SHUFEN Coming! Hi Shufen, have you come to check out the house? What do you think? Is it OK? Take your clothes off! Shufen, don't torture me! You're all over the place! - My heart hasn't recovered. - You talk too much. Are you going to take them off? Shufen, how did this happen? I'm immediately so happy! Shufen, yay! Go take a shower! OK! Spray it! OK! Shufen! This is going to be amazing! Put it on! We need clothes? Are you going to put it on or not? OK! Hey, Shufen, dressed up like this, is it good for movement? What movement? These are for the end of the world. You believe in that? Xie Defa, I'm angry every time I see you, but when I think about it, if this is the end of the world, you are still the one who I want to be with. Shufen! Shufen! Shufen! Ah! - Oops! - Sister-in-law! Excuse me! Didn't know you were here! We have done nothing! I know! But there must be something in your heart. - I have a good idea! - Not a word! Don't you know what kind of person I am? We haven't remarried after all. - No. - It's really a good idea! - I will kill you if you don't leave. - Don't push me! I admire your dignity! I am leaving! Sister-in-law, bye! Shufen, you've got worse now! A little too heavy for my taste! Will I have to put on a U.S. police uniform later? I hate myself! Shufen, it doesn't matter! Everything is fine! You being you, is why I'm attracted to you. These days I still want to be with you! What days? Isn't it a good thing? The end of the world. It's the end of the world! Why do I suffer from such bad luck? As soon as we make up, the world ends! Who knows if it's actually going to happen? If there is a tomorrow, we can go home for the Spring Festival. But, what if it is true? Then we're lucky to be together. We'll be nothing but fossils when humans start to exist again. Do you think... If we get a little closer... we'll melt down into the same rock? OK, grab my hand then. Shufen! Shufen! It's still here, still here! The world still exists! Yeah, it still exists! The world exists! It still exists! Isn't it great! Oh, my goodness! What's going on? Who are you? - Who are you? - I... - Teacher Zhang! - You've made this into your wedding room! How the hell did it come to this? Let me explain! We thought the original style wasn't appropriate. - I changed it! - Then you should've asked me first! - Do I approve your changes? - Xie Dafa! - Why is he... - It's OK! It's OK! What are you doing? What are you doing? I tell you this is my house! Xie Defa! She is mad! Xie Defa, who is she? Teacher Zhang! Shufen! Why did you come here? I didn't mean to lie to you. I was so afraid you'd despise me so I did a stupid thing. How can I ever trust you again? Shufen, give me one more chance! Let go of me! - There are so many people here! - My decorating work is good. Shufen, what's wrong? No, nothing! Xie Defa is from my hometown! Nothing, madame, you may leave! I'm in a hurry... You are funny! Grabbing Shufen from my house and asking me to leave first. Shufen of your house? What do you think? Shufen is of your house? She is of my house! Xie Defa, don't be silly! Who is of your house? Then, you're not of her house either! This is Madame Zhao, and I am her babysitter. What's going on? Shufen, is this man bullying you? Don't be afraid! I am here to protect you. Babysitter! Shufen, you are good! Hey, Xie Defa! - Go home! - You go first, and I'll be back soon. Xie Defa, stop! Don't be mad at me! Nothing's wrong with being a baby sitter! I really am an idiot. I don't remember anything! You played very well! Who played? Yep, it's all my fault! I'm the immature one! I don't know anything! I should cooperate with you! Come on, let's play! Are you done yet! Didn't you play a game, too? President Xie! Do you despise me being a baby sitter? Don't we all work outside of our village? Looking for a better life. Stop, liar! You are the real liar. I am the liar? You are kind indeed! What was that all about becoming a fossil with me at the end of the world? Liar, Liu Shufen! You are the real liar! OK! I am a liar. I'm nothing but lies. My whole identity is a lie. There is nothing between us. Fine, Xie Dafa! I, Liu Shufen, won't marry you even if there were no others I could marry. In your dreams! Do you think I want a fake millionaire? Get out of my sight! It's OK. I understand you! Eh. Maybe you could try the man I introduced you to. It might heal your wounds. Ah, you're drinking. Shufen is going to marry someone else. Her employer has sold the house and is going abroad. She helped Shufen find a guy. Shufen is packing and the guy's family and friends are here. The bridegroom is the man who owes you money. You idiot! Shufen! Shufen! Shufen, don't go! You promised you would go home for the Spring Festival with me. Shufen, do you hear me? Shufen, at that time I was a cavalryman in the army. You came and visited me. You wanted to ride with me. I didn't let you. You weren't angry. You just watched me ride. To and fro, to and fro. To and fro, to and fro. Xie Defa! Shufen! Don't you still remember when we were little, we rode horses together! Shufen, don't you remember? Come on! Give him the money! The wages! Hi Geng Zhi! The script of the village show is very good! There is room for improvement. Oh, there is good news. Xie Defa called me, he and Shufen will be home the day after tomorrow. They'll be here the evening of the Spring Festival. They're going to dance... the horse riding dance! I am prophetic! The script is ready. - Really? - I want to add some details. There will be a family reunion dinner for the New Year. Each family will provide their favorite food to share with each other. The workers who left the village will be home for a New Year holiday season! Let them show off their talents! There are so many stories from our village. Xiangcheng's mom is a good designer. We can let her design our stage! That's it! - You have to apologize. - I am sorry! Why are you apologizing? Because of you, I apologize. I'll beat you to death! I am so tired. Because I was on the show If You are The One , you were not happy! Will you let me feel unhappy in the future? Never! Yuan Fang there are so many things keeping us apart. We both can't hide forever. We could run away. - I don't want to leave. - We're not going anymore. But staying here our two kids will continue to fight. This is really discouraging. We both could run away. You name a place, then we'll go. Is this a runaway? What? It is not. I got it! You go with me to see my idol! Oh, yes! That's not the best plan! Tomorrow night 8 o'clock, see you at the village entrance. If you're not there you can forget about us! The grandson of this aunt sends his greetings far from the Aircraft Carrier Liaoning. Also more good news, he will soon be a vice-squad leader. Shan Xi, how long is this going to last? Don't be in such a rush! Chill and enjoy the show. It's a good show, sit down! Don't be in a rush! The small programs are great! If it is not raining from heaven the Chinese crabapple will not blossom. Shan Xi I have to go pee! - No, I have to go! - Don't be in a rush! Hold it! We will go pee together. Your deeply loved one will be home soon. Yuan Fang! She didn't wait for me! Yuan Fang! My dad may not make it. What's going on? Guo Shu's momma, you are the best cook in our village. I'm thinking you could make some delicious food for my dad. - Make him more comfortable! - I am not that good. My son, Guo Shu, is better than me! Guo Shu's cooking is very good. Sun Kuoshu? Where is my brother? He is a hotel chef in the city. BAOQIANG AND LUODAN WORK HAND IN HAND TO PRESENT A CULINARY DELIGHT FOR GOLDEN SNAKE YEAR There are many ways to cut cucumber. The best one is my way. Hello Chef. Hello. Hello Chef. Hello Chef. You guys are working hard. Put on your own hat! The uniform! One day, I will be the greatest chef. A chef like your father. You know when you put on his hat, you really did look like him. Really close! I look like him? You are the same as my father. Both of you are close to the kitchen. I just like to eat! - What? - Nothing! But no matter what you do, you aren't even a little similar to my dad. Let say this, in this life I will marry a man like my father. You remember that! I want you to be my Master. I want to be a chef. A man like you! I want to learn how to cook. Really! Go back to where you came from. Being a janitor is a good job.

Please let my daughter go! You want to be a chef. How could you give Yi Nan a better life! What kind of food have you seen and eaten? There is no way for you to learn how to cook! It's nothing but cooking! I can do it too. My grandma taught me in my hometown. Grandma? I am a chef. It's the same, cooking. My grandma taught me how to cook amazing food! I've tasted what you cook, and I can do the same. You don't buy it? You can taste what I cook. Do you know how to turn on this fire? I learned it while watching you work. You crazy kid! OK, cook, cook, cook! I'm sure you'll be willing to accept your failure. How is it? I have cooked more than enough. But, will people have to go to a hotel to taste food like this? Furthermore, it doesn't look appetizing! Ignore the appearances, the food is for people to eat. Being tasty is good enough. If you don't believe it, I'll bring them out to the customers. They will like it! Did you make this? You're fired! I know! I know! Go forward, then east! Turn several times, and we will be there! Look, I didn't lie to you!

Now, what I am going to do? All these years, how often have you tasted my cooking? What do you mean? You should learn from watching dad's work! Sun Kuoshu, you didn't keep your promise. You told me you could settle down. But you can't! Look, if my boss finds out there isn't any ranking chef, you will take full responsibility! Zhou big hole is leaving, but his daughter is here!

I can't swallow it! - Uncle, you're out and about! - Kuoshu is home! Happy now? Tell the kids working outside the village to come home and have a Spring Festival! - We miss them! - This is fresh! - It's not clean yet! - It's fresh! You tell them, this is from my house.
