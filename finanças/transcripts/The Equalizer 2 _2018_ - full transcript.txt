Hot water, please. Excuse me? He said, car is closed. He get for you. - Thank you. - You're welcome. American? Guilty. First time to Turkey? No, no, no. Been here... ...a long time ago. Different life. - Now you come back. - Yes. Looking for something. Hey. My brother. He say... ...you can find whatever you wish in Turkey. Yeah? How about a man who kidnapped his own daughter... ...and took her away from her American mother? An abusive man. So not a real man. No love for the child. Just a need to punish his ex-wife... ...to take the one thing away from her that meant everything to her... ...with no intention of returning the child. Do you think that...? Excuse me. Do you think I could find that man in Turkey? Or maybe... ...on his way to Turkey? I... ...would not be looking for such a man. It would be... ...dangerous. For you. Men like him would think that. And, God as my witness, I would give him a chance. To stop. To reconsider. To think about the worst thing that could ever happen to him. To imagine that. There are two kinds of pain in this world. Pain that hurts. Pain that alters. Today... ...you get to choose. Baby. Oh, baby. Oh, my God. - Oh, God. - Mom! Oh, my baby. Are you okay? My baby. The State Department doesn't know a thing about it, Grace. No one does. Just that 45 minutes ago, someone delivered your daughter... ...to the desk downstairs. Oh, I love you so much. I love you, I love you. My favourite driver, always on time like clockwork. - Samuel. - Roberto... ...it's not easy getting in and out here. Copy Centre? - Copy Centre? - Yes. Lift off! How am I today? The same, only worse. Every day I know less. Welcome to the club. Thanks for the Lyft. And a piece of advice: Always be nice to anybody who has access... ...to your toothbrush. Okay. Thank you for this interview and opportunity. Now, as you can see from my résumé... No, no, no. Thank you for this opportunity. I've admired your company's position towards the environment... - ...and to be a part of that... - Ma. Ma, I got accepted. Yeah, I got accepted, Ma. I got... "It is with great pleasure that we write to offer you admission... ...to the College of Engineering, class of 2019," Ma! I gotta finish high school first. I don't get to choose when I go, Tommy. - Right. - The Army does that. I'll text you when I'm at the gate. I love you both. - Where you headed? - Iraq. First tour? Yes, sir. I'll be there to pick you up when you get back. Thank you. - How they coming? - Left you something upstairs. Did you? - Thank you, Fatima. - You coming to the potluck? Yes, I'm coming. Plates and napkins. - Napkins and plates. - All right. And forks! Why are you doing this? I got your name on a piece of paper in my pocket. It's all that matters. Hey, hey, hey. Look at me. No, no, no. Stop talking. - This is happening. - Please, don't. Your son's gonna be home any second, right? - Open your mouth. - No. - Open your mouth. - No. - Weathermen are the best. - Princess hairdressers are. - Weathermen are the best. - Dolphin trainers are totally the best. You don't have to know anything. There are screens on the sides and the front. - You don't see anything. - They are the best. You curl their hair... Hey. Mr McCall. - Ordered a book last week. - Oh, yeah. McCall. I... I don't see it. I'll be right back. Man with the list. "Hundred Books Everyone Should Read." - Guilty as charged. - In Search of Lost Time. - Came in yesterday. - Thank you. What number? Last one. Well, I hope you start another list. - Me too. How much? - Forty, please. Thank you. Sign is down? - Sale sign. - Oh, a change of circumstances. Not going anywhere now. I don't want a drink. I don't want a drink. I don't want a drink. "God... ...grant me the serenity to accept things that I cannot change... ...the courage to change the things I can... ...and the wisdom to know the difference." Would you...? Would you mind taking me back where you picked me up? Just, other foot. Right there. Come on. You got it. Easy there. Easy. One step. Keep going. All right. There you go. Could you just help her get in her apartment? Thanks. Stop cheating, bro. How you doing? I'm the driver you called to take home your girlfriend. - Not a girlfriend. Just an intern. - Oh, I'm sorry. The credit card was invalid. Shithead. Let you hang with us because your daddy's a client... ...and you fuck up the first thing. Come in. There you go. I heard about these, never seen one before. - Yeah, well, now you have. - Yeah. Look, pay yourself whatever and give yourself a nice tip, huh? Thank you. Thank you. You're not gonna ask me if she got home okay? - She get home okay? - No. Took her to Mass General. They're pumping her stomach as we speak. What's her name? You don't know, do you? Okay. This is the point where usually I'd give you a chance to do the right thing. But not tonight. Tonight I'm gonna need your cameras, cell phones... ...anything you might have used to record what you did to her. You knocked on the wrong door tonight, pops. Oh, God! Jesus Christ! Come here. Get up. Get up. Don't start crying now. Give me your phone. Right or left? - I don't know what you mean. - Handed. You right- or left-handed? - Right. - Call 911. Tell them the truth about what happened here. Your daddy's money's not gonna save you this time, understand? - Yes, sir. - You know her name? No. Her name is Amy. Give me your left hand. Give me your left hand. I expect a five-star rating. You understand? - Yes, sir. - Not for me, though. For who? - For Amy. - That's right. For who? - For Amy. For Am... - For who? Make sure I get a five-star rating, junior. Fuck. Hello, Susan. What? How in God's name did you know it was me? - I could smell you. - For God's sake, I just peed. Yeah, but you ate asparagus vinaigrette... - ...with soy sauce. - Oh, you. No, I smelled your perfume. How are you? - You good? - Better now. Very good. - Brought you something. - Soup. - How'd that thing in Turkey turn out? - Happy ending. No pun intended. Well, I guess that means you owe me dinner. I didn't agree to pay for dinner. I... - You gonna try to weasel out? - I'm not. I just... No, no, no, my friend. I don't work for free. How's Brian? - He's good. He's got a new book out. - Yeah? - Maybe I should read it. - Oh, yeah. You know, if geopolitics of Nepal prior to the 1816 Sugauli Treaty... ...is your bag, definitely. - Friendship has its limits. - So does matrimony. I haven't read it yet. Doubt I ever will. You here on business? Meetings. Meetings, huh? Well, birthdays are the hardest. I know I always think of my brother on his. Yeah. I was folding laundry the other day... ...and I realised that I didn't have... ...any clothes left that Vivienne had ever seen. I can't say that's a bad thing. What? She didn't appreciate my taste in clothing either. I'd buy something, the next day it was missing. I'd ask her about it... ...she'd say she didn't know what I was talking about, and... She'd act like she didn't know what I was talking about. "I don't know what happened to those purple shirts you used to buy." And then I'd put one on that she liked. What? I didn't say anything. I'm sorry if I made a mistake coming to you on Vivienne's birthday. I just... Robert, I've been thinking: Maybe you should go back, huh? It's great, you helping all these random people and everything... ...but it's not gonna fill that hole in your heart. Go home, huh? Make peace with it. That's what Vivienne would have wanted. Oh, hey. - Always a gentleman. - That's right. Hey, I'm obligated to tell you these things... ...being I'm the only friend you got. Airport, please. Hey, Mr McCall, maybe you could find out who did this to Fatima's garden. Kids. - What up, man? - How you doing? Hey. You should make the building do that. It's what they supposed to do. "Supposed to do" and "will do" are two different things, Miles. - Yeah, but you live here, right? - That's right. I pay the rent too. - You should let somebody else do this. - Like who? Shit, I don't know. Anybody. - Not a tenant. - You're right. I guess anybody could do it, but nobody does, Miles. Ends up with everybody complaining... ...because nobody did what anybody could have done... ...or should have done to begin with. Yeah. All right. You know they got... They got painting companies around here. I know they charge six-, seven-hundred dollars to do the job. I know that. Word? Shit, I'll do this for 350. You? Yeah. - What? - Nothing. What, I look handicapped or something? It's a quick dip and roll. It ain't rocket science. No, you're right. I'm an artist, man. I go to Bridgeview Arts. Why aren't you in school? I don't be doing all them everyday classes. You know, I got a... Got a special talent. Yes, you do. And it takes talent to make money. But it takes brains to keep it, Miles. Well, I'm out here making my money. Short money, Miles. That's short money. I'll tell you what. Three-fifty's a little high... ...but I appreciate the offer. All right. - All right? - All right. It's gonna be a lot of work, man. - All right, Mr McCall. - All right. - So you still out here doing this? - Yes, I am. You ain't covering nothing. Not yet. What is this? Walmart paint? Primer. You gotta prime it before you paint it. Don't teach you that in art school? Yeah, I knew that. I've been thinking about your offer. Been calibrating... Two-fifty. - Two-fifty? - Yeah. Two-fifty, I'll take care of all of this for you. - For 250? - Yeah. All right. But you can only work on it after school. - Shi... - Don't curse. What time you get out? - Three-fifteen. - Okay, after school, 3:15. Deal? Okay? All right. - But cash, all right? - Okay, cash. - Don't be checking me. - I'll be checking for you. All right. Miles. Stay off them corners, son. Gun oil on his lips. Nine-millimetre at his feet was registered to the victim. No other prints in the house. - You have questions? - Well, Mr Calbert did work for us. When something occurs to one of ours, the agency is obligated to look into it. So, yes, you will be hearing from us. Thank you. - Susan, Susan. - Keep it locked down until we get there. I can't find a file. When did he become one of ours? I don't know. Upstairs kept him off the radar for some reason. Susan. - Car's here. It's okay? - Oh, hey. Oh, you look great. - What about a tie? You need a tie. - I'd do what she says, Brian. - You have one? - Got it. - Great. That's perfect. - All right, I'll see you later. - Have fun, sweetheart. - Bye. Yeah, I'm gonna have to go there and cross the T's. Wanna come? Oh, damn, and leave this shitty office? Brussels has the best chocolates. Well, we'll go. We'll find out. Today, I broke a personal best: Successive days alive. All right. Here, I got photographic evidence. That's the portrait of my sister, Magda. I was 9. The war came. Like most families, we were separated. My sister, Magda, and I were sent to different camps. I never saw her again. Sixty years later... ...I'm in Paris... ...and I see somebody auctioning my painting. Twelve million, can you imagine? "You got to have proof," they say, "to get it back." Now I got here the proof. Wait till the judge sees this. Looks like there's coming a storm. It's time for your check-up, Sam. Hello, sweetheart. He's still obsessed with the painting. Tried to help him years ago. He said he had proof it was his, even way back then. He didn't. No record, no bill of sales. He just keeps going back to court to hear the same thing. Guess it gives him something to focus on. It helps when you have nobody left, you know? - The reading went great. - Embarrassing. - No. - I signed two books. That's all. Thank you. - Sure we can't drop you at the airport? - No, I'm fine. Thank you. - Thanks for coming. Good night. - All right. Good night. - Do me a favour. - Yeah? See what you can find out. - Yeah? - Oh, another dinner, then. - I'll see what I can do. - Yeah? I do fly off to Brussels tomorrow. - Thought you were retired. - Oh, I am. Just like you're dead. - Okay. Very good. Good night. - Good night. I saw you painting yesterday, Miles. It's primer. It ain't paint. So all this bullshit under there, it don't show through. My brother painted that. It's the place we grew up. Yeah? Well, you live here now. Powder of some sort. Hard-drive contents and cell records? You'll have them later today. Susan. Okay. Thank you. - You okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. Right behind you. I don't know. Seems to me the judge... ...he didn't even pay any attention to me. I mean, he hardly looked at all the evidence I had. Well, that's it. It was a very rare painting, Sam. Maybe... Maybe that's the reason why it looks so familiar to you. This is my sister, Magda. Was younger, but that's the only picture survived. My uncle... ...commissioned the portrait... ...as a gift for her 12th birthday. Was a young artist, just beginning... ...but, oh, you should have seen it. Not just the resemblance... ...but a spirit that shone through it. It glowed, you know, like a beacon. "My little brother," she'd say. "My Sammy." I could never protect her. To lose her twice... ...I can't imagine. - Hello, Susan. - I had no idea you were an art lover. That information you wanted just came in. - Kind of surprising. - Okay. - I'm sending it to you right now. - Good. - Yeah? - Hey. Calbert's bank records are fine. Texts, e-mails. No marital discord. No girlfriends, no boyfriends, no lovers. Not even an inappropriate message to a co-worker. And what about the wife? Oh, come on, Dave. Women fuck around too. Think about it. When's the last time you sent your wife flowers? Noted. Noted. Data on Calbert's hard drive just came in. We'll talk about it on the plane. I wanna get out of here. Run some theories by Stan. All right. Watch. - I'll see you downstairs at 6? - You got it. How about some of that delicious Belgian chocolate... ...you're always talking about? Or you're not getting on the plane. Guess I'm going back out. Oh, crap. Oh, great. Oh, my... What do you want? Get up, bitch! No! You're hurting me! Where is the money? I don't have any money! Where is the money? Fucking... Fucking why? Who the fuck are you? Come on! No! Oh, fuck! Let go! Brick will make this pop out. Picasso this entire building. - Picasso it? Yeah, okay. - Yeah. How much? It's on the house. I like that. - You been drawing a long time? - Since... ...about third grade. What is this? That's how I sign my work. My brother, he was a boxer. It's the right hand of God. He catch you with it, you know. You go to heaven or... Okay. - He still fighting? - No. Somebody shot him. Coming back from the gym. Not even ganged up on or nothing. Just wanted his gym bag. What? I didn't say anything. Anyway... ...my grandmother says if you don't... ...remember somebody out loud... ...they die twice. Grandmother was wise. Hey, Brian. Yeah, listen, I'm reading your book right now, and I can't believe you... Yeah. Yeah. Got it. Yo, Mr McCall, you good? Hey, yo, Mr McCall. Oh, thanks, Dave. No, the... The police in Brussels, they say that... ...it happens in these hotels, these robberies. But she never wore any jewellery. Not even a watch, and... Except for this. Here. What'd the agency say? They said... ...they'd do everything in their power. They're working with Interpol. Promised to find whoever it was. But... ...I don't know what to do now. Where's the phone? Is it yours? It's not mine! Where the fuck is it? ...Things to remember as the storm continues its march northward. We saw what Frances did in the southeast part of the country. It appears to be moving as slowly as it left the Gulf Coast. That is what worries meteorologists. Even as the storm is moving up the Eastern Seaboard... ...every city and town that has been hit has experienced a storm surge... ...dangerous flood levels. National Guard has been deployed in several states to prepare for lootings. All right. Watch. - I'll see you downstairs at 6? - You got it. - I'll see you downstairs at 6? - You got it. You got fat, Dave. I was in the same lobby... ...when that bomb went off. Looking right at you... ...when that hotel came down on us. You were there and then you weren't. Wasn't my day. I went to your funeral. Grieved a long time over you. Susan, she knew? I was your partner for seven years. Kept nothing from you. I'm sorry, Dave. I am. I never had a chance to say how sorry I was... ...about Vivienne. You still at the beach? Not in a long time. Well, I got me that cabin. Take the wife and kids up a couple times a year. Wouldn't have any of it... ...if it weren't for Susan. Life got... ...dark. She talked me off that ledge I was heading over. Probably over a bowl of soup. I owe her my life. You ever talk to the boys? No, not for years. Hell of a team we were, right? - She never pushed a button, Dave. - Who? Susan. On the elevator. She never pushed her floor number. I checked all the video. Backpackers got on first. They pushed number 16. She didn't have to. They knew what floor she was on. They find them? Pieces of them. Couple of tweakers, with sheets as long as my arm. My good arm, anyway. Gas explosion. - At least that's what they're calling it. - What do you call it? Tying up loose ends. Autopsy report. Stab wound. Two millimetres. The lower third rib. - Close-quarter technique. - Exactly. That was taught. This was no robbery. Something else went on in that room. Mac, whatever it is, whatever you need... ...I'm in. - I know. - Same mud. Same blood. What's the deal, bro? - This is about some other case? - The Russians. Listen. - York. - Dave. Listen, the gun... ...next to Calbert was on his right side. He was right-handed. Why? His wife was shot by somebody left-handed. Somebody else was in that room. Powder residue came from a latex glove. Twenty thousand euros were found in the backpackers' flat. - Hey, Bob. - Dave. Those guys were set up. Right. Agency assets are taken out all the time. Opposite side loves sending a message. Why stage it? They didn't know he was one of ours. Susan was about to figure out who was in that room. That's why she was killed, Dave. The two were connected. I'll get back to you when I know more. Keep me posted. Yo, man, elevator's closed. Listen up, little nigga. You ready to put in work? Everybody in my camp put in work. - One down, little nigga. - No snitching, no bullshitting. Clock in, nigga. Let me hit that. Pass that bump. Let me get that, man. - You all right, little nigga? - Yeah. - You good? You sure? - Yeah. It's all that. Listen, man. You know you gotta spin the bend tonight, right? - You know you gotta spin the bend. - Yeah. Didn't them niggas kill your brother? You gotta empty the whole thing on them. Right. You gotta take care of that tonight. Run down on them niggas. Make sure you kill one of them ill niggas tonight. Make sure you empty that whole thing. Yo, listen. Your mother already buried your brother. Don't have her bury two sons. You hear me? - Yeah. - Don't come back without it empty. That's a fact, B. - Shit. - Let's go, Miles. - Holy shit. - Sit down. Sit down. Sit down. - Sit down. - Who the fuck is this nigga? Your father. Your mama didn't tell you. Let's go, Miles. Let's go, Miles. Let's go, Miles. Do you know this nigga? Where you going, B? Yeah? Shit. - Bang. - Yo, who the fuck was that, yo? - Look at this homey. - Yo, what the fuck happened? What the fuck is going on? - Come on! - Get the fuck off of me, man. - You know where the fuck we at? - I know. Do you? I know where we are. This what you want? Is it what you want? You wanted to draw. Isn't that what you said? - Draw? - Yeah. - Paint? - Yeah. What the fuck is that gonna get me? That shit about to put food on my fucking ma's table? That shit gonna pay the fucking bills? No. You need to be a gangster, a killer. Little Yummy, huh? You need them. Okay, if that's what you want. If that's what makes you feel like a man, be a real man. Let's get jumped in now. Here. - Start with me. Start with me. - No. - Here. Start with me. - No. - Take it. Come on, killer. - No. Come on, killer. Come on, killer. Put it right there. - No. - Know how to hold it? You know what you're doing? Come on, killer. There you go. There you go. There you go. Five pounds of pressure, that's all it takes. Come on, gangster. Five pounds of pressure, that's all it takes. Five pounds of pressure, that's all it takes. Give it to me. You don't want it. Give it to me. Come on, give it to me. I ain't gonna do nothing to them. See, you know what they are up there? They liars, and so am I. See what happens when you deal with a liar? - See what happens? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - I lied to your little punk-ass. - All right. I'll kill you. What do you see? Tell me. Give me a right answer. - What do you see, killer? - I don't know. - What you see? You don't know? - I don't know. I don't know. All right? "Man" ain't spelled G-U-N, son. You got a choice. You got talent. You got a chance. Don't wanna hear about your environment... ...what your mama didn't give, white man won't give you no shot. You got a chance. Use it while you're still alive. You don't know what death is. You have no idea what death is! - Make a decision. - All right. Hey, yo, Mr McCall. - Why me? - Why not you? But... But why me? Let's find out together. With a storm this size, that surge could be 6 feet. It's the speed of the hurricane and that giant eye... ...that could absolutely deluge the coast. Frances is very slow... ...due to the amount of rain that Frances is holding... ...and that it's moving so slowly. It appears in no hurry to move on. Awaiting another press conference with the governor about efforts... ...to prepare for the storm and the inevitable rescues... ...and the following recovery effort. Governor's already said that he may ask the president... ...to declare the state a federal disaster... - Hello? - Mr McCall? - Who is it? - It's me, Miles. - I finished the bricks outside. - Yeah, I saw it. This is your change for the extra paint. - That's all of it? - Yeah. So, anyway... - ...you have something to drink? - Yes, I do. - Would you like something to drink? - Yeah. Come on in. Iced tea or water? What I look like, Jackie Chan? - Thank you. - You're welcome. Yo, you know they sell these in sets. Yeah. - What you making? - Arroz con pollo. - Moms makes the same thing. - Does she? - Yeah, she puts some... - I'm not your Moms. And that's not your pot. And this is not your house. - You understand? Okay. - Yeah. Yeah. - Yo, this wall need a paint job. - Yeah, it does. Yeah. - I could do it for you. - Could you? Yeah. How much? If I could get a plate of that food... Yeah, man. No, seriously, 115. That cool? All right, I'll make a deal with you. - One-fifteen, huh? - Yeah. Here you go. Free. Read that. Can you read? - Yeah. - What does it say? Ta-Nehisi Coates, Between the World and Me. All right. You read that, we got a deal. - Airport? - Yeah. Is it somebody's birthday? My daughter. Nice. How old is she? She's 5. Guess you don't fly that often, huh? Been driving in the opposite direction of Logan for the last three minutes. Hey! No crust either. - Mom? - Eat up, sweetie. Mom says I have to go to the dentist. She never has to go. - The gardener? - Grapes. - Can I have a treat? - You know where the grapes are. Oh, my God. My life is so hard. - Here's your grapes. - What...? - Come on. Show me what you can do. - But... Seriously? - Seriously. - Come on. Hi, baby. Mommy made a nice map. A, Maine. Very good. B, New Hams... "New Hamster." Carol, who is it? Carol? It's New Hampshire, not "New Hamster." But I like it as "New Hamster." - Okay, leave it "New Hamster." - The front doorbell is broken. Your old Army buddy was at the back door for five minutes. Actually, I was his team leader, seven years. Oh, my... Baby, I'm so sorry. I must have forgot... This is... Got the days mixed up. This is Robert. This is my wife, Carol. - Hi. My pleasure. - Hi. Pleasure to meet you. - These are our daughters. Molly, Alice. - Hi. Hi. - Come here. Say hi to... - Make yourself at home. - Thank you. - Call him Mac. - Do you want some coffee? - No. I'm fine, thank you. - Sorry about the mess. We were... - No problem. - I gotta get these two off to school. - Okay. Girls, let's go. Out of these pyjamas. Nice. - Robert, nice to meet you. - Oh, my pleasure. - Sit down. Come here. - Yep. Take these off. Let's go. - You all right? - Yeah. Get those teeth brushed. - You got a beautiful family. - Thanks. What's going on? I took this off the guy... ...who tried to kill me yesterday. It's like you said, they're cleaning up. Everybody who's looking into the Brussels hit, nobody's safe. You, your family, nobody. That's military-grade encryption. You should take it to your office, run the numbers... ...and check the names against passenger manifests... ...in and out of Brussels in the days surrounding the flight. Whoever we're looking for made calls to that phone. I'm on it. I'm on it. Tell me I'm wrong, Dave. You gonna answer it? What happened, Dave? You died. That's what happened. Three months after you disappeared... ...government shut us down. I went private right after. Doing the same things you and I did for God and country... ...killing names on a piece of paper. Only now... Now there's a price next to them. - We killed the enemy. - Who said they were the enemy? Not us. Not me. We just followed orders. Mac, there are no good and bad people anymore. No. No enemies. Just... ...unfortunates. And Susan? Unfortunate. No one knew the Brussels contract was a deep agency asset. Susan was gonna figure out who was in that dining room. She was the only one who could have, right? Until you crawled out of your grave. You get the chocolate? Oh, fuck. Susan worked in a dangerous world, Mac. Could have happened anytime by anybody. - But it wasn't anybody, it was you. - Just... You spare me the righteous bullshit, all right? You do what you have to do and you move on. There's no moving on from this, Dave. - We gotta pay for our sins. - What about you? - Do you deserve to die for yours? - Hundred times over. All right. Well, guess what. There is no sin. No virtue. It's just shit people do. They trained us to kill people and risk our lives doing it. Then one day, you get a call saying they're done with you. "Thank you for your service. Here's a plaque." You need a job? Good luck. You need medical insurance? See the VA. One day, you're an asset. The next, you're a fucking afterthought. It was a natural evolution. It's who we were. It's what we did. It's what you did. - Now it's what we do. - "We"? It's not just me, Mac. It's all of us. Ari, Resnik, Kovac. All of us. Family. Gentlemen. Mac. Looks pretty good for a dead guy. We all want you to know, none of this is personal. What you do and become is not my concern. The world is full of so-called men like you. And in a perfect world... ...everything we do comes with a price... ...but this ain't a perfect world. People do bad things. If you're lucky, you get a chance... ...to set it right. But most of the time, it goes unpunished. This ain't one of them times. The mistake you made was you killed my friend... ...so I'm gonna kill each and every one of you... ...and the only disappointment is that I only get to do it once. Train's gotta go. Alice has music practice at 7:45. - Hey, Ari, fellas! - Hey, Carol. - Robert, hope to see you again. - Nice to meet you too! Dave said you could give me a lift to the station? - Bye, Daddy! - Bye, Dad. Help and company? Let's go. See? Help and company. - You take the little one! - Okay. Come on. See you at work! Look, I don't think my wife had a favourite. She never gave a lot of thought to clothes. I'm fine. I'll bring something over in the morning. Who's coming after me? The men who killed Susan. Why? Because you're a loose end. - What's up, Miles? - Hey, yo, what up, man? - Where are you? - I'm at your crib, actually. - I don't have time right... - Finishing up these walls. Going with the spearmint green. Yo, you got any food around here? I'm starving. What's all that barking? Go to the window. Tell me what you see. Yeah. Hey, these dogs outside going crazy. Listen. Hey. Out toward the street, tell me what you see. Oh, it's just some dude out here delivering pizza. Hang on. Hey, yo. Hey, yo, Mr McCall. Shit. Oh, shit. - I think somebody's trying to get in... - Miles, listen carefully. Go to my bedroom. You'll see a bookshelf. - Go. Just go. - Yo, what? - Hey, yo, what...? - Miles. - All right. All right. - Miles. See it? - Yeah. - All right. Middle shelf, there's a book by Richard Wright: Native Son. - What? - Listen. Just do what I tell you. - Native Son. - Pull it out. - Want me to read it? - Pull it out. You'll see a button. I want you to push the button. You're gonna push the button, it'll open. Go inside, close the door behind you. All right. Man. Oh, man. Oh, man. - Yo, what is this place? - All right, calm down, calm down. Just sit down. Be quiet. Be very quiet. Don't move. Hey, Mr McCall. - Yo, who are these people? - Let me worry about that. Clear. Calm down. Get in the hole. Go inside. All right. Yo, man, I don't do well in small spaces, man. - I can't even breathe, man. - Son, son, slow down. Fucking lungs is... Is closing up and shit. He's looking right at me. Don't worry about him. It's a two-way mirror. - You can see them, they can't see you. - It's too dark in here. I can't even feel my legs. I can't even see my feet. Relax. Just breathe. Don't talk too loud. Turn your phone off. They'll see the light. Turn it off. Fuck. Fuck. How you doing, Dave? You know who it is. Since you're in my house, water my plants for me, will you? I'm not gonna be back for a while. It's a mistake to go to war with us, McCall. You got it backwards. You're going to war with me. You know where I'll be. I know where he's headed. He's going home. Hey, kid. Back up. - The town's evacuated. - How you doing? Just got off a double shift. Gonna check if I left my gas on. All right, make it quick. Let the grey BMW through. Copy that. What do we have here? I need you to turn around. Town's been evacuated. Where are you? Slow down. That was his wife's bakery. Go. Pull over here. Clear the alley. Mac's house is back there. Making entry, yellow house. All clear. Coming out. Taking high ground. I got movement, 12 o'clock. Kovac, move in. Ari, what's your sitrep? Locking down, south side. Making entry, north side. Kovac. Kovac! Kovac, come back! Shots fired! Shots fired! I'm going in. Going in. - York, you got eyes on him? - I see him. Making entry, north side. Fuck. Ah, fuck. - Kovac's down. He's gone. - Say again. Kovac. He's down. He's fucked. Push towards the ocean. Repeat, push towards the ocean. What the fuck? Ari. Resnik! Somebody talk to me. Ari. Son of a bitch! Ari's down! Ari's down! And Mac made a fucking mess of him! There's pictures of Susan everywhere. He's picking us apart, man! I need fucking eyes! Goddamn it! I'm on the southwest corner of the yellow building. I got a blood trail. He's headed across the main drag. Rear of the bakery. Copy that. Move inside, Resnik. Move inside. Resnik, do you copy? Resnik! Come back! Fuck! Just me and you, Dave. Nobody's left. Not exactly. Remember what you taught me. Always have a contingency plan. Come on, Mac. Show yourself. I don't know who the kid is, or if he means anything to you. I took the chance that he matters. I'll make it simple. Step out, show yourself and I won't kill the kid. The wind makes it interesting. Side mirror. Two more. Third one goes to the middle of the trunk. Taillight. I was a hair off on that one. I might have hit the kid. All right! Time's up, Mac! Nice move, Mac. But it's not gonna make any difference. Where are you, you son of a bitch? Fuck you, Mac! Fuck you! You couldn't save your wife, you couldn't save Susan... ...and you're not gonna save this fucking kid! Is that in your playbook? Is that in your fucking playbook?! Show yourself! All right, take your time. Right here. Sit down right here. There we go. Put this on. There you go. Let's see. Yeah, it went in and out. It's not bad. - Hey, yo. - Yeah? - My moms is gonna be pissed. - Yeah, I'll talk to her. Yo, not at me, man. At you. - You talk to her, then. - All right. - Count to three. One, two, three. - Three. - It's all good. - Yep. - I got your back. - I appreciate it. - Hey, Mr McCall. - Yeah? Who are you, man? - Hey, Mr McCall. - Yeah? I think the bleeding stopped. Good. Good. - Sit down. - This your place? Yes, it is. Come on, sit down. What are you drawing? I'm... I'm working on a superhero character. - What's his power? - What's his power? He knows things before you do. You know, he has... ...secret rooms, magic locks. You know, shit like that. Stu... Stuff like that. He fly? No. He act... Actually drives a Malibu. That's funny? Honestly, that's cool. - Okay. - I love it. Respect that. Appreciate that. So... So you can understand... ...that when a resident says things... ...that are... That are grandiose by nature... ...we tend to dismiss it. So you can imagine how surprised we were today when... When... If you could just give me a moment, okay? Here. My Sammy? Magda.
