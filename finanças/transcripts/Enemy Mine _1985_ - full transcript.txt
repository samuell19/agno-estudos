[Man Narrating] By late in the 21st century, the nations of the Earth were finally at peace, working together to explore and colonize... the distant reaches of space. Unfortunately, we weren't alone out there. A race of nonhuman aliens called the Dracs... were claiming squatters' rights... to some of the richest star systems in the galaxy. Well, they weren't gonna get it without a fight. Space was the new battleground. For many of us, Earth became a precious memory light-years away. Our only home was a fortress in space. As in any war, there were long periods with nothing to do but wait. And then... [Speaking Alien Language] [Woman On P.A.] All personnel to battle stations. Prepare to launch. This is not an exercise. All personnel to battle stations. Prepare to launch. This is not an exercise. [Murmuring] Flight leader. This is Echo 2. I have four bandits at 3:00 inbound. Roger, Echo 2. I copy. Right 90 and go for it. Echo 6 to flight leader. Our buddies are pulling the yellow line. Roger, Echo 6. Cleared hot one-on-one with two backup. Snuff these bastards, get home early, huh? I got a hot date with Merchison. The nurse? This time it's gonna happen. She's gonna give in. I guarantee it. Isn't that the same Merchison we used to call the white balloon? Come on. She's lost 20 pounds. [Chuckling] [Laughs] Got ya! - That-a boy. - Yeah! Six more bandits on three. - Leader, copy that? - Roger, Echo 2. I guess they thought we didn't see 'em. I sure as hell didn't see 'em. Did anybody see 'em? I see 'em now. - Well? - Will, bandit on zero. Hold on to your lunch, Joey. Echo 6, bandit's closing! - Where is he, Will? - He's right on your damn... - Oh, Jesus! - Bastard! - How many k's we got left? - [Beeping] Another 65, but we have a heat problem. - What the hell's Will doing? - Say your prayers, toadface. Shit! Engine heat beyond normal! Come on, Will. Blast 'em, and let's get out of here! That's Fyrine Four down there. Unexplored territory. Wait, Joey. [Shouts] We're hitting atmosphere. Visors down! I lost him! What's on the scope? Willie, for God's sake, pull out of here! We're gonna burn up! Damn it! Where is he? He ejected! He's out! - The bastard's out! - [Screams] Come on, Joey. We're punching out! Oh, shit! Get your nose up. Come on. Come on! Get your nose up. That's it. That's it. Get up, get up! Easy. [Grunts] Come on, Joey. [Grunts] Come on. Come on. Joey! - Are you okay, Will? - Υeah. I'm fine. Will, when you see Merchison, just don't call her the white balloon anymore. It hurts her feelings. Okay, Joey. And don't let the guys call her that. I liked her. It's a promise, Joey. Now, you be still. You lay quiet. - Will. - What? I'm really tired. [Explosion] Joey? Hey, Joey! I'm sorry, Joey. I'm sorry. [Will Narrating] I could see where the Drac fighter went down. Its ejection capsule couldn't be far from the wreck. I just hoped it wasn't dead... yet. It's funny, but I'd never actually seen a Drac. I knew they were completely inhuman, not even male or female, but both, bundled together in a scaly reptilian body.

Nehsayyy! Nehsay! Yeah, nehsay. Get our butts up higher in the forest. Up there. At least there's some cover up there. Cover? You know, cover? Earthman. [Alien Language] Exactly. I'm glad you agree. [Drac Trills] Yeah, yeah. Next time, huh? I'll put that knife right up your kazoo, if you got one. [Alien Language] Okay, toadface. You gonna shoot me? Go ahead, shoot me. Come on! Shoot me! Go ahead. Do it now! Shoot me! The point is, Draco, whether we live or die. I don't love you, and you don't love me, but we're stranded here, you understand? You get it, or don't you gavee English, huh? [Trilling] [Alien Language] Yeah, poogah. Write and tell my mother, you big frog. Look. What we gotta do... [Trilling] What we've gotta do is we have to build a shelter with stones. Shelter. You gavee? Shelter? [Will Narrating] It was slow going. Since I had to communicate with that lizard, I tried learning a few words of its crude lingo. [Sighs] Hey, Drac. Drac, uh... [Alien Language] [Alien Language, Trills] Forget it. Enough talk. Let's get on with it, huh? Shit! [Will Narrating] Of course, the Drac was picking up a few words of English too. Yeah! Shit! Shit? What do you mean, shit? No solid. It's solid. I'll show you. Huh? Ha-ha! Not solid. [Snickering] [Drac] Left foot. [Trills] Right foot. This is my left foot. This is my right foot. And this am both my feet. Yeah, great. Yeah, great. This is my head. That is your ugly head. No, no. This is my head. That is you head. You ugly head. [Laughing] Ha, ha. That is Davidge's ugly head. [Laughs] All right, that's enough! You keep that up, and you can learn English all by yourself... because I'm not gonna be your teacher anymore. Sorry, Davidge. [Snickers] That's better. You know, while you're having such a good time and doing nothing, I am trying to think of ways to improve our situation. - Okay. - Υou know the old saying... If at first you don't succeed, try, try again. Davidge, you learn this from great Drac teacher, Shismar? No, from Mickey Mouse. - Who? - Mickey Mous-s-s-se. Mickey Mouse. Is this great Earthman teacher? Yeah. Sort of. ♪ Shine its ever-lovin' light on me ♪ ♪ Let the midnight special ♪ ♪ Shine its light on me ♪ ♪ Let the midnight special ♪♪ Forget it. [Gasps] Mmm! Delish. Have one. [Alien Language] Don't forget you helped me acquire the taste. Besides, I'm going to improve the menu. Soon we picked up... one side or other side. What, with the war going on? We got more chance of catching a greyhound bus. Humans, easy you give up. Shismar teaches us... intelligent life takes a stand. [Laughs] Where'd you get that crap? Out of that little book you're always reading? I'm the one that's taking a stand. Remember, I wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for you sons of shitmat. Shismar! Yeah, whatever. [Trills] This war begun by you, by humans! You know something, Jerry? Your great Shismar eats shit. [Trills] Earthman, your Mickey Mouse is one big stupid dope! [Suppressing Laugh] Yay! Meat! Hey! Stay there, you mother! Hey! Hey! Hey! Aha! Whoa! You dirty, rotten son of a bitch! [Spits] Shit. [Rustling] Hey. Hey, goddang it! [Gasps] Huh? [Groans] Hey. Hey. [Chuckles] Hey, hey.

[Shouting] God! You saved my life. Why? Maybe... I need to look at another face... even as ugly as yours. So you still think humans are ugly, huh? Compared to a Drac, very ugly. But that thing out there... was even more ugly than you. - Thank you. - You are welcome. Ha-ha! That's it! Even that thing under the ground couldn't bite through this. I bet these shells are meteorproof. [Laughs] They're meteorproof! What? Zerkiproof! Zerkiproof! [Laughs] Jerry, old Drac... [Laughs] Where would you be without me, huh? Back home. Ah, shit! Hey, professor, how about a little help, huh? Don't you ever get tired of reading that book? No. Well, what's in it, anyway? Things. Oh, for Christ's sake! It is called Talmon. It contains the words of our great teacher, Shismar. I suppose you have to know the Drac language to read it, right? It would help. So teach me the Drac language. It is not for you, Davidge. Shismar is too good for us humans, is that it? Not too good for humans, but too good for you. Now you're a judge of character. Do you not remember what you say about Shismar? Well, maybe you forgot what you said about Mickey Mouse! That was wrong. I did not mean it. I didn't mean what I said about Shismar, either. Jerry, what- what are you... This book must be given to the pupil. I then become the master. I am not worthy, but there is no one else here. [Alien Language] [Will Narrating] Time passed, as time does. [Trills] We ate, we slept. And sometimes I listened to the skies... for some faint hope of rescue. [Gasps] In the meantime, I studied its language and read its Talmon. [Speaking Alien Language] Translate. "If one receives evil from another, let one not do evil in return. Rather, let him extend love... to the enemy, that love might unite them." I've heard all this before... in the human Talmon. Of course you have. Truth is truth. But what you have not yet learned... is the way we Dracs express the truth. The words of Shismar must be sung. ♪♪ [Trilling] ♪ Ooh ♪ ♪ Zotair ♪ ♪♪ [Alien Language] Jerry! Come on! Come on! Let's go! Come on, Jerry! Come on, Jerry, move it! Run! Get up! Get up, damn you!

It's so loud, I wake up. And then I can still hear it. It was a dream. I don't know. Maybe. But I do know if we stay here, we die. Sooner or later, we'll die. If this planet don't kill us, we're gonna kill each other. You sure you won't come with me, huh? Davidge, I stay here. I have no interest in your dreams. Any chance is better than no chance. Oh, come on, Jerry. You're just being stubborn. No, I am not just being... stubborn. If I find help, I'll come back for you. And if you do not? Then I guess we both die. Alone. I'll see you later. [Clanging] [Grunts] [Laughs] [Laughing] Hello! Anybody! [Clanging] Core samples. They're core samples. [Screams] Scavengers. [Grunts, Shouts] [Will Narrating] What I'd been hearing at night was the scavenger ship. The scavengers were human, all right- barely human. They were outlaw miners who raped whole planets for precious ores. They hunted Dracs for slave labor, so we tolerated them. I could only hope they'd found nothing. I had no idea what I was gonna say to Jerry. [Grunts, Panting] [Grunts] Davidge, how cold do you think it's going to get? I don't know. I guess we'll find out. I am happy you came back. Jerry? Hey, Jerry, what's wrong? I could not go with you. It is no longer my life that matters. I am not fat. I am not lazy. Davidge. I await... a new... life. A new life? From where? Oh, my God.

One day I must stand with Zammis... before the holy council on Dracon... and recite our lineage... so that Zammis may join... the society of all Dracs. Ow. You wanna eat? I can't.

It is an honor I offer you. I'm sorry. Right now just staying alive is honor enough, huh? All right. I will learn your lineage. Let us begin with your parents. Who were they? My dad's name's Carl. My mom's name's, uh, Dolores. Their deeds? Well, Dad works for a company that makes computers. And my mom, she used to be a waitress. Waitress. Yeah, before they got married. And their parents? [Chuckling] We used to visit my grandpa when I was just a kid. He had this place out in the country. I-I think he was a farmer. And, uh, Grandma was just a good cook. Oh. That is your lineage. Here stands before you... Willis E. Davidge. Fighter pilot. Son of Dolores, who used to be a waitress. And Carl, maker of computers, who in their time were born of Grandpa, possibly a farmer. And Grandma, good cook. You make it sound pretty thin. It is thin. But I am honored... that you entrusted it to me. My own lineage is very rich, Davidge. Learn it from me.

Yeah, it's a great game, isn't it? Of course, you don't normally get to eat the ball. That's a bonus. And I've simplified the rules for the conditions here. Small teams and so on. I've been thinking, Uncle, about those humans you saw. Maybe they are friends with the Dracs. Maybe they asked them to come and work. [Alien Language] I wish that was true.
