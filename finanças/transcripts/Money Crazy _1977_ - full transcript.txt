Rich Chen He even sent a hit man to kill you Really? But why me too? You ripped him off once What are you doing? Under such circumstances Chen's not going to let us go We'd rather follow you I have given the three fake diamonds to a private detective Lure the Uncle's people out Then he instructed Ping to kill them one by one Awesome, Boss It's hard to be a good person in the world Good people got loss That's right, Boss Will you stop flirting with me? But that's love at first sight Shakespeare had also said Love at first sight means trouble He's Ignorant Is he a genius?

Fantastic Boss You got a lot of toys To locate Chen's diamonds We have to eavesdrop I was a private eye too Why did you quit? I couldn't make enough money So I became a professional bootlicker Sometimes the tips are enough to live on Intelligence is what makes one rich Weren't I corrupt, I'd be an inspector now I promised my father will get rich this year But all I've had is bad luck How can one get rich By being a bootlicker like you? You think I like it? If only I could do otherwise Will beat 10 Rich Chens easily The two of us together Well? Partners? What...are you doing?

I won't tell you Dude, of course you won't talk about it if you're dead But I'm young, why make it hard for us? You're so unfaithful. I won't tell you Still so stubborn? Still so stubborn? Be smart and tell me I won't tell you Why are you so good to uncle? I'm an orphan, he brought me up No wonder you help him so much I'll do anything for him Anything? Have you two... What are you talking about? A Rose for the diligent gardener - Thanks, uncle - Don't mention it Just finish that side too Yes, sure That 3 diamonds of uncle's How did Chen get them? Uncle may be weird, but he's kind Yet he indulged in gambling and trusting people Chen was actually his godson Really? Chen exploited uncle's weaknesses And gambled with him often Unfortunately Chen's a swindler So uncle lost all his money Full house Wait a minute No wonder uncle's psychologically unstable What happened afterwards? Uncle went broke he had to sell his diamonds Chen brought along a foreign buyer Who offered a very high price Trusting them, uncle brought his diamonds I'll go to the bank right now Be back to pay you in 30 minutes Is he really coming back? I think so. But if you're worried Why don't you put the diamonds in the safe? And wait until he comes back That's the safest, isn't it? You're right You'll keep the key Excuse me, I've to go to the bathroom Sure Years later we found out that the buyer was Chen's accomplice But we had no evidence Uncle got so mad that he's paralysed Are you really going to help me? I'll suffer anything for you Chen may be ruthless and tough But I ain't stupid either Freeze, Move it, Kneel - How did you come up here? - There's a ladder there Look out Get me up Robber I'll kill you Diamonds!

Let's go That was an outstanding performance If I won't make it in this line. I'll try to be a star Frankly speaking. If we return the diamonds to uncle We'd have gained nothing One has to think for oneself too You're great Then how could I lose my diamonds? I've summoned three friends. We'll get the diamonds back Where are they? That's the game of today's hit men? They're educated overseas Boss - How are you, Mr. Chen - Nice to see you Made any good deals lately?
