A bird parrot in the house during the murders. Police saw the parrot screamed and flapped his wings ... whenever he saw his nephew victims. They interrogated the nephew, and he admitted the murder. Therefore, animals can be substantial evidence to support ... for police investigations. Miss Expert, already show a variety of images of the suspects in the BeO. Whoever he saw, just say "genius" and "stupid" repeatedly. There were taught the words to be repeated. Or, as long as he uttered two words, it will be fed. How many things can be remembered Beo after seeing? In the history of zoological world, The most intelligent animals are African green parrot. Once taught, can calculate the sum in 6 minutes, mentions 50 different objects, and 7 colors. His intelligence is the same as my nephew who was 5 years old. So, he should be able to recognize something already seen. The key is how you could persuade him to express himself. Apapunlah the rapid process of course. Teach the bird language. But Cantonese is the most difficult language in the world. Although talented person like me can not prevail against it. Moreover, a BeO. If you want a quick process, there is an easier language.

We do all the dirty work for yours. We deserve more. You're no different from Wong. What do you want? Throw us all in jail? And let Wong fun alone out there? Inspector Yip. What if we were to 4 parts? This information came from informants. But Redhead have killed him. I'll take his share to his family. Well. That's good.
