This is Cooper, I'll turn it out... and all's well. [exclaims] Emilio! Yannick! Dog Schmidt! What the hell...? [chuckles] Hey, compadre. what's an old soldier of fortune like you doing in a uniform? Like you see, chief of security. That's perfect, come back with us, we can use a man like you. [Dog Schmidt] It'll be just like old times. [Cortez] Help us and it'll be share and share alike. You've got to understand, this is my job. -[Cortez] That's shit. -[Dog Schmidt] Don't be a fool. We can all be rich. We know the whole month's production's in there, all set to go. I can't do it. I can't do it. I can't do it! [ominous music] Jesus Christ, Emilio, he was an old comrade! Always had crazy ideas. Ah, good morning, sir. Sorry to rouse you so early, but we're on a tight schedule this morning. -Open it! -[tense music] Open! My father told me... a man always gets what he deserves. [tribal music] Looks like toxic poisoning. This far into the Delta? They've had a big Tsetse fly spray along the main boundary. Let's take a water specimen, Joseph. You can bet it's contaminated with DDT or an overdose of endosulfan. -But that's against the law! -Yeah. I'm gonna speak to the minister about it next week. If they go on like this, this place will not last very long. There are some people who want it that way, others who just don't give a damn. Well, we better move, my dad and Mary will be at the airstrip any minute now. [peaceful music] [Mary] Just look at this place! Well, here it is, the Oberness Hilton! [Mary] I'm staying here forever. [chuckles] It's great to have you here, Dad. A year's been too long, son. -Can I look around? -Sure. There's a hippo pool just on the other side, be careful. -Okay. -Oh, lunch is almost ready. [Mary] All right. Well, what do you think, Dad? A lot different than Redwood City, huh? Now I understand why we can't get you back on campus, this place is beautiful. [curious music] [foreshadowing music] It's one of the last unspoiled places on Earth. Yeah, boy, you don't have to tell me again, I'm sold. It's gonna take a lot of money to preserve it. You can count on the University supporting you all the way, I'll make sure of it. It sure helps having a father on the Board of Governors. Yeah, why not? You're way ahead of the Harvard boys with your research, you've got those stuffed shirts jealous as hell. -I'll call Mary. -Okay. Mary! [tense music] Mary! Mary! Joseph! Joseph. Are you okay? I don't know, it was so fast... Dad! Dad! [dramatic music] They've been kidnapped ! Joseph, get some water, biltong and biscuits. Combat boots. Yeah. Let's go. [dramatic music] All the tracks are still here. At least we know they're both alive. -Who would do this? -That's what I'm gonna find out. We must report this to the American Consul in Bagwata. Joseph, you go back, tell the Consul what happened. But, Mr. Wayne... I'm coming with you. No way. Joseph, you know what'll happen if they catch you. I'll cross at dark, rest up on the other side. It's full moon. I'll just have to chance it. [adventure music] [groans] [confused groaning] Hey, compadre, do you have a cigarette? No. Welcome to Malindi Re-education Centre. Must be doing a lot of re-education right now, This wasn't my idea. Ah, American? What are you in for? Crossing the border illegally, I guess. [groans] It's a very serious offense in these parts. You could spend the next ten years rotting in here. -What? -This is Africa, my friend. So, what were you after? Ivory? -Diamonds? -My father... was abducted across the border. Ah, that's different. There's always a big stink when Americans get in trouble in a foreign country, huh? [sighs] What are you in here for? Oh, they're going to shoot me. Shoot you, what for? For stealing 5 million dollars worth of diamonds, besides reducing the local population by a couple of hundred. What do you think of that, eh, compadre? I guess that could upset some people. In my trade, you win some but you lose only once some. All I hope is that some of the bastards shoot straight. What happened to the diamonds? Oh, I die, they die with me. But you... [distant gunshots] Damnit! We've got to get out of here. [distant gunshots] Look, if you manage to do that, I have an idea. There's an Irishman who runs a mission station. Nothing much happens he doesn't know about His name is Father Riley. How do I find him? Try the singer at the Pussycat Bar... Who is also the mistress of Colonel Lavara. Who the hell is Colonel Lavara? Ah! That is a rare pleasure you have yet to experience. -[punches] -[man cries out] -[knock on door] -Enter. The American is here. [prisoner] No, no...! I'm Colonel Lavara, commanding State Security, and you... you entered the country illegally, without papers, and bearing arms. Perhaps you'd like to explain. You wanna explain to me why you kept me locked up in that cell for 3 days? Regrettably, we had to hold you while I completed my inquiries, we thought you were a bandit. My father and his assistant were abducted and taken across the border into this country. I want them back. A one-man rescue mission. It's commendable, but, my friend, you can't catch a lion with a mousetrap. But I would have done the same. And I do understand your concern. We received this only hours ago from his abductors... And this. They wish to trade your father for a criminal who is about to be executed. What criminal? Let me enlighten you. His name is Emilio Cortez, he's the leader of a band of mercenaries who are really now nothing more than bandits. They find Africa a soft touch and the local governments are powerless, that's why a man like I am here. I don't give a damn who you are! Let me finish.. please. They say they will kill your father the moment this man is executed. Now, that means we only have three days. So, damnit, stop the execution! Habana. Banned in the United States, I believe. [sighs] We cannot change our policy, and we simply carrot bow to their threats. [lighter clicks] [sighing] Mr. Garrison, I will allow you to stay in the city until the end of the deadline, I have arranged hotel accommodations for you, some clothes, a bit of money... But in exchange... you must promise not to interfere in any way with our handling of the matter. You understand what I'm saying to you? -[piano] - ♪ Even though my heart ♪ ♪ Is not to blame ♪ ♪ But I changed my feelings Once again ♪ ♪ If you love me ♪ ♪ I'll never be the same ♪ ♪ 'Cause you're Touching my heart ♪ ♪ With your pain ♪ ♪ Changing my life With your feelings ♪ ♪ How could I help it if we ♪ ♪ We're falling in love again ♪ [applause] [upbeat song starts playing on piano] -Hi. -Hello. My name is Wayne Garrison, can I buy you a drink? I'm sorry, I don't drink with strangers. Please... I need to talk to you. I believe you know a man called Father Riley. -What do you want? -I need to talk to him. Look, I'm sorry, I've gotta go. Please, if you don't help me, my father will die. Please. Midnight, the street behind the bar. [eerie music] Another minute and you wouldn't have found me here. I'm sorry, I had to make a little detour. I think I was being followed. What do you want from me? Some Americans were abducted. -I know. Everyone knows. -One of them is my father. Who told you about Riley? I man I met in Malindi Prison. Sounds to me like you're playing with fire, Mr. Garrison. You'd do the same thing. Do what? Every goddamned thing you could to save your father's life! A heroic knight in modern clothes. Now tell me how I get to Father Riley. Be here again before sunrise and make sure you're not followed. [mysterious music] [rock music] By the way you handle these tracks, you must have been in Africa a long time. I was born here. Before independence, my father owned a big coffee plantation. It's not 50 kilometers from here. -What happened? -The usual story. It was nationalized by the new government. In exile in Europe. What are you doing here? I'm gonna get our plantation back. Your accent, it's very American. I was in California for 6 years, at university. The girl, Mary... does she mean a lot to you? No, not that way. She's my father's assistant. What exactly do you do, Mr. Garrison? I'm an ecologist, and a writer of sorts. I'm working on a project to save the swamp lands. Ah. Another American under the spell of Africa. She's a very seductive mistress. [adventure music] [distant hammering] Ow! [car approaching] Now, Mr... Garrison, is it? Wayne. All right then, Wayne. I'll have some tea brewed up in a second, meanwhile... A little something to keep the rheumatism out of your bones. -Cheers. -Thank you. You don't happen to be a... an engineer, do you? No, I'm not. Well, neither am I, as you can probably see. The water tower? Yeah. It's the third one I've built. -Where are the others? -Oh, no. I mean it's the third time I've built that damn thing. The first, high wind... [chuckles] something to do with stresses and strains in the foundations. But that's not what you came here to talk about, is it? I need to make contact with the people who are holding my father hostage. You know what I'm talking about. Oh, by the Holy Mother, Wayne, I'm just an innocent missionary. Not from choice, from calling. If I had my way, I'd be a sailor. Level with me, Father. Do you know who the kidnappers are? Now what gave you the idea I'd know a thing like that? Huh? Does the name Emilio Cortez mean anything to you? Has Mr. Garrison told you the reason for our visit? He seems to think I know what's behind every bush in the swamp lands. Well, don't you? or are you too bashful to admit consorting with bandits? Oh, by the Holy Mother, Nicole, we consort with bandits all the time here, Some of them even run the government around here. Explain to him, Father. Well, the outlaws sometimes need my help. I'm the only man in a hundred miles they can come to around here with any medical knowledge, so they let me get on with my work and I keep my mouth shut. There's a deadline less than 72 hours away. You've got to get me to them before it runs out. Oh, Wayne, they could be anywhere now, even back across the border. [man shouts a warning] [man shouts again] [military drums] Quick, into my room. [tense music] Nicole's car. Drive it around here, quick. [car engine starts] [military music] Lift up the tank. [suspenseful music] Get inside! Cut the engine. [ominous music] [shouts instructions] [Riley] Ah! Good afternoon, Lieutenant. -Father! How nice to see you again so soon! But not another confession, I hope, eh? -[both laugh] -You've been a good boy, eh? No, Reverend Father, we're too busy these days for getting into trouble. Oh, really? Search all the buildings! [military music] [Lieutenant] I must ask your permission to search. [chuckles] Permission refused. [ominous music] Going to be right this time, eh? It will, with the Lord's help. -Very big, eh? -Yeah. How about a shot of whiskey, Lieutenant? This is not right. You will have a big problem when you put that on top. Oh, let's not worry about that now, let's go and have a drink. Not worry about it now, eh, but when you put water inside, then you have to worry. [helicopter approaching] Every time someone captures an American there's too much trouble. There's nothing, sir. -Get the men mounted, Sergeant. -Yes, sir. [muffled voices] [Riley] How about that whiskey now? Another time, we have a lot of ground to cover. But when I come back I will help you, and we'll fix that water tower properly, eh? Oh, that's very kind of you. And sorry for the intrusion, Father. But it is duty, you understand. God go with you, my son. [car engine starts] [military music] Would you like lunch al fresco or room service? Well, what do you think of him? He's a good man. If anyone can help, it's him. He sure walks a tightrope. He's very brave. Not too many people like that. You know something, Nicole? You're a helluva woman! Well, I won't stand by and see innocent people murdered. What do you think Lavara would do if he found out about this? I think he would kill me. Well, thanks again. I'll take it from here on my own. [Nicole] Stay at the hotel, I'll call you. [suspenseful music] Elias! [dramatic music] what a surprise! I didn't expect to see you here today. I've been waiting since an hour. -Anything important? -Yes, my dear, very important. I harm an urgent conference upcountry. This, uh... incident with the Americans is reaching alarming proportions. How long will you be gone? Two, or perhaps three days. And where has my little lovebird been? The river perhaps, swimming. It's such perfect weather for swimming. Do you happen to remember an American? [tense music] A stranger, blonde, he was sitting alone in the bar the other night... I don't remember, why? Nothing. [phone rings] -Hello. -[Nicole] He knows about our trip to Father Riley. Look, he told me he was going upcountry for a couple of days, but it could be a trick. I mean, you could be arrested at any moment, we've got to hide you! -Where? -Riley. Get out of the hotel and stay out of sight until later. I'll meet you behind the Pussycat at midnight. Take care. -[knocking on door] -[suspenseful music] Who is it? Come in, gentlemen. Colonel Lavara's compliments, he wishes to see you. And my compliments to the Colonel, but I have plans. I had plans. You know, you have a bad attitude. I'm afraid your friend isn't coming. What are you talking about? Nicole, you insult my intelligence if you think I'm unaware of your liaison with Mr. Garrison. That should put an end to your little games. You... are under house arrest. [suspenseful music] Sit down. [suspenseful music] [tense music] [tires screech] [aquarium bubbling] I promise, Colonel, we will find him. If I may suggest, sir, perhaps Miss Laroche can-- What about Mademoiselle Laroche? Well, you must have noticed, sir, she appears to like the American very much. What are you saying? Answer me. It is possible she will lead us to the American. Her liaison with Mr. Garrison was on my instructions, you will leave Mademoiselle Laroche to me. -Find Garrison. -Yes, Colonel. [car approaching] By the Holy Fathers, you look like you need a little refreshment. How did you find your way here? It wasn't easy. Let me guess, you fell foul of the good Colonel at last. He had his goons pick me up. Uh huh. Were trying to run away with his girlfriend, eh? Mind you, I've often thought of running away with her myself. So you had to leave before you got my message? What message? Dog Schmidt is here, he found me before I found him. He wants me to deliver a final demand to the authorities. -Where is he? -Out there. Better leave this here. We'll dispose of this when we get back. Now, this won't be easy. Stay cool, whatever you do, don't make him nervous, it's the only way if you wanna save your father. Dog Schmidt may be a brute, but he's a very cautious man, that's why he got away and Cortez didn't. [dramatic music] I see what you mean. Dog, this is Wayne Garrison. What do you want? I want to negotiate the release of your hostages. Get me Emilio Cortez and I'll release them. You know damn well they're not gonna trade Cortez for anyone. I promise you, if he dies, I'll present the heads of your friends to Colonel Lavara in a sack. Why don't you break Cortez out? I'm a professional. If there was a way to get him out, I would have done so. What if I can get you into Malindi? Give me an answer. Until sunset. or there will be three heads in that sack! [dramatic music] Now you're met the new captain of the old dirty team. Real charmer. [suspenseful music] [Lavara murmuring softly] [knocking] Enter. Sir... Miss Laroche, she's left town in a borrowed Land Rover. -You sure? -Positive, sir. Bring her in. But sir, should we not wait? Are you questioning my orders, Sergeant? No, sir. When you bring her in, you make very, very sure that no harm comes to her, okay? And when you bring the American... Never mind. Go. [suspenseful music] [upbeat music] So, what do you have in mind, Wayne? Any ideas? I'm afraid not. I wonder what Nicole did when I didn't make the rendezvous. She's a smart girl. I hate like hell to get her mixed up in this. Somehow, I've got to make a deal with Schmidt. Remember, Wayne, make a deal with the Devil, he ends up owning you. [car approaching] Out of sight. [dramatic music] By the holy saints, my darling, need I ask what brings you here? Have you seen him? [military music] -Is he here? -He's safe. Now, quick, out of sight, I'll give you three quick whistles -the minute it's all clear. -All right. Good day, gentlemen. A little early for tea, I'm afraid. The more I see of you, priest, the more I understand Colonel Lavara's interest in you. -I'm flattered, I'm sure. -Don't play games with me. I have orders to bring in Miss Laroche and the American. Oh, what makes you think I know where-- There's no place in Heaven for a lying priest. -Tell me where they are! -Search me. We know they are here. If you don't want me to break your legs, you'd better tell me where they are. You know, you have a very nasty temper, Sergeant Bragia-- [cries out] [Nicole] Leave him! Stop that! -Are you all right, Father? -Yeah, I'm all right. I don't like the men who keep following you, though. No trouble please, Miss Laroche, I have orders from the Colonel to bring you in. [dramatic music] That won't be necessary. [Nicole screams] [screaming] Are you okay? But, sir, we have searched everywhere, they've just disappeared. [Lavara] Three men cannot disappear into thin air! -You find them. -Yes, sir! You find Mademoiselle Laroche. Yes, sir. Where did you learn to shoot like that, Garrison? Would you believe five years Special Forces? This doesn't change anything. What is your plan? Give me some more time to work out the details. One hour. I'll go make some strong tea. Wayne, what are you gonna do? If only we could get into Malindi Prison. I can get us into Malindi. You're kidding. All we would need is an order from Colonel Lavara. Great, how do you propose to do that? By theft and forgery. I mean, I've been with him for almost a year and I've always had free access to his office. I can't ask you to do that. [scoffs] What about your father? Why are you doing this? [romantic music] If you haven't figured that out, Mr. Garrison, you never will. [Wayne] The Warden's office is about here, the solitary is here, where I guess they're still holding Cortez. Now, all these walls face the outside. Don't forget you still have to get out. Oh, I haven't forgotten, Father. Okay, we'll need a real heavy truck or something. -No problem. -Explosives? Leave the logistics to me. Now with these, you should have no trouble getting into town. Okay, let's get to work. The Bishop wouldn't approve, I'm sure. All in a good cause, Father. [action music] [suspenseful music] It's not exactly what I'd call five-star accommodations, my friend. Kiss my ass. I think I have been reasonable with you long enough. I know you think your friends will break you out but... Tell me where the diamonds are, you're a free man. How many times do I have to tell you? Go screw yourself. I could torture it out of you, you know, I could torture it out of you. Torture me. I'll tell the whole world where they are. But that's crazy! Only a madman would die for a handful of stones. I will shoot you at noon tomorrow, and then we'll have lunch. Guards! Perfect! [laughs] Security Police. I'm escorting these United Nations officials to an important meeting with Colonel Lavara. No one is allowed to pass before daylight. Colonel Lavara will not be amused if you make us late. Remove the road block or I'll have you on report! [tense music] You know what this means if we screw up. Don't worry, I know his routine, he's a very precise man. Let's hope our timing's right. -Is the Colonel in? -He's not here... for another 15 minutes. Well, then I'll wait for him. If you wish, you may wait right here. Come on, Raul, you know who I am, I've been in the Colonel's office many times! I don't think he'd like it if you left me standing here in the street. Of course, Miss Laroche. Go right in. [suspenseful music] I've put his personal stamp on every page. Nice touch! How much time do me have? Just under two hours. I've got these two people here, a lady and a man... Come with me. [Guard] Open the gate! This is quite unusual, Mr. Crawford. It's all in order, Captain. Colonel Lavara was here just a short while ago, and he said nothing about this. Why don't you phone the Colonel? Ah, one minute, Captain. When Colonel Lavara agreed to let us see the prisoner, he gave us only fifteen minutes. Now, when you speak with him, why don't you see if you can get us a little more time? Madame De La Rey wishes to get a full statement from the prisoner and his treatment here. You've come just in time. We're gonna shoot the bastard. -I mean, the prisoner. -[telephone rings] Yes? Yes, Colonel! [fake accent] They are to have no longer than 15 minutes with the prisoner. You understand? No longer than fifteen minutes and it's your responsibility! That was the Colonel. He specifically instructed that you have only 15 minutes with the prisoner. I must tell you, frankly, that I find this all very unusual. Follow me. Follow me. These United Nations officials have permission to speak with you for 15 minutes. Precisely 15 minutes. My name is Stephen Crawford, and this is Madame De La Rey from Amnesty International, we're here to make inquiries about your treatment. The letter specifies in private, Captain, if you don't mind. Fourteen and a half minutes! Garrison! What is all this? We're here to get you out. Get me Colonel Lavara's security headquarters! Immediately! I don't know how, Colonel. It is on your official paper, with your personal stamp on. They're in the cell right now. There is no way they can escape. Luis! Luis! Get me to Malindi prison! Help! Guards! Help! Guards! Help! What? Let's go! -[guards yell] -[gunshots] [machine gun firing] Cortez has escaped. I will give the general alarm. No. You take care of matters here. Take me home. [screams of joy] Hey, where are we going? I hand you over to Dog Schmidt, he releases my father, that's the deal. I'm afraid I'll have to change your plans, Mr. Garrison. Now, you do as I say, or she'll have a broken neck. What the hell are you doing, Cortez? I made a deal with Dog Schmidt! From now on it's my show. Now, move it! It's a trick! Don't let them get away! Get out. Go! There's a track branching off to the right of that tree, take it! They're trying to lose us! [Nicole cries out] [tense music] Hello, chief... Long time no see. Eh, compadre! Where you been? I missed you. It's been a long time since you ran out on me, eh? Just tell us where the diamonds are. What diamonds? Cut the shit, Cortez! We want them now! Why don't you, uh, ask him. -What is he talking about? -I don't know! Look. You've got him. All I want is my father. Screw your father! [machine guns rattling] [Cortez] Stop right there! -[loud slap] -[Nicole grunts] [machine gun burst] Get behind the wheel. Move! Stop right there. Get in. Don't worry, she'll be alright. Move! [threatening music] [Nicole groans] Dog Schmidt and the rest of the scum ran like hell, eh? Yeah, honor among thieves, huh? Wherever you think you're going, you're not gonna make it. This won't be the first bullet they've dug out of me. They won't take this one out of you, you son of a bitch. I didn't ask you to break me out! I never repay favors. [ominous music] [Cortez] Right. Get out. Hold it. Move. [Cortez panting] [sighs in pain] Over there... Start moving those rocks. Hurry up! Now throw it here. [gasps with pain] Now lie flat on your face. Get over! Right. Get up. Was it worth it? [Wayne] Only you know that. From now on, it's everything I want: Money, women... But first, you're gonna drive me to the border. Put 'em in the bag. [helicopter approaching] Hah... Emilio, looks like Lady Luck has stood you up. [weakly] I'll kill you, son of a Mongolian bush pig. See? You lose. I win-- If you didn't have that gun, I'd bury you where you stand. Hey, you. Pick'em up. Every single one of 'em. You kill me... no witnesses... -Is that it? -Yeah, that's it. [Lavara] Then I get out of this stinking country. [vicious scream] [both men grunting and gasping] [Wayne] Let's go, come on. No talking your way out of this one, Lavara. [tense music] Drink it, it's good coffee. Drink it. -Dog! -Tie her up. What happened? Get the medical kit and give me some of that coffee. [labored breathing] [military drums] This is the best I can do, Dog, the bone's badly splintered. You need real surgery and you need it damn quick, man. We can still get the diamonds and square things with that double-crossing mother..! We're moving out. What about them? We keep the Laroche woman. She could be useful. No gunfire, I want the girl first. Don't make a pig of yourself, we've got to get moving. [woman screams in distance] [Mary] No...! No! [Mary continues screaming] Oh, Wayne thank God! How did you find us? Are you alright? -Where's my father? -He's fine. Your friend Nicole is here, too. -Where are they? -Over there, about a hundred meters away. Here. There are three men guarding them, one of them is wounded. Hold this. Okay, follow me. Stay behind me. Go and find Mitterand, this is no time for fooling around. -You okay? -Yeah. Something's wrong. Let's do it now. [ominous music] [screams] Oh, it's great to see you, son! [violins playing] -Are you okay, Dad? -I'm fine, I'm fine! I knew you'd get here. Thank God you're okay. [Lavara] My compliments, Mr. Garrison, you've done the impossible. All I want are the diamonds. Okay. First let her go, and they're yours. [Lavara] You throw them over here, and you drop your gun. First let her go. [scoffs] Do it my way, and we have a happy ending. Nicole, please hand me the bag? You are such a fool, all this could have been yours. And now for my last trick, I'm going to make us all vanish forever. Another mystery out of Africa, eh? No, Elias, please! Think what you're doing! I'm very sorry, my dear, but beautiful women are far easier to find than five million dollars, eh? And you... I regret that your romance was so short lived. You hardly had time to... know each other. [suspenseful music] [Wayne] You got what you wanted, why don't you just go, and that'll be the end of it? [Lavara] In my country, we have an expression: Dead birds don't sing. [Lavara screams] Garrison! Help me! [Lavara yells in agony] [faintly] Garrison! [peaceful music] It's paradise! [happy music]
