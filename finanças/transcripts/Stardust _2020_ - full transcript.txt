Commencing countdown. 10, nine, eight, seven. Error. Circuit malfunction. Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Sir? You need to buckle up. We're landing now. If Washington is your final destination, then from me and your DC Dulles flight crew, a warm welcome. Next. Hello. Name? David Bowie. This says David Jones. Yes. It is a felony to travel on someone else's documentation. Oh, uh, Bowie is a stage name, you see? I, I haven't used David Jones for a long time. I'm here to play some concerts. So where's your visa? Sorry? This is a tourist visa. Oh, I'm sorry, officer. There must be a mistake. You see, well my wife's an American citizen. But where's your green card? It's... Um, I'm getting one. Please, there's a whole tour planned. It's extremely important. You see, I've got, I've got an album coming out- - Sir. Stop talking. Sir, does this garment belong to you? Uh, ye, yeah. You dress in women's clothes? It's a man's dress, actually. It's by Michael Fish, he's, he invented the kipper tie. ♪ Early in the morning, 'bout the break of day ♪ ♪ That's when my baby went away ♪ ♪ Came back baby, I wish you would ♪ ♪ Try and love me, you won't do no good ♪ That fuckin' dress. Hi, David. Hi. - There he is. - Hello boys. ♪ You know I still love you ♪ ♪ Wanna give you romance ♪ David. Come on, Marc Bolan's here. David. Our bed of love is like a glove, tender and warm, that we creep into when the eye of north whines like birds of prey. Our goblet sails smoothly on ethereal dreams like a mountain, solid. It begotten of the earth and at the old mother's mercy. Brown is the bread of the wilderness, but tender and with limbs light and subtle. David. To the eternal washing in the spring of wisdom. Winged, but not burned. Do you know him? Yeah. I married him. I'm sorry. Oh, its not that kind of marriage, darling. We don't keep secrets. We screw whomever we adore. No bourgeois morality. If you want him, you have to come through me. Frail and frank, pillowing our sleepy bodies. Silent in the noise of the night. Meet us upstairs later, babe. We snuggle and vibrate, entwined like saplings of the vine. Oh, that's marvelous Marc, really beautiful. Cheers. It's about scaling to a higher realm of consciousness where God can dictate to you. Congratulations, mate. Ride a White Swan. It's at number two. Yes. I wrote it on this batch. David, why don't you join us? Might help unblock you. Go on, have one you big blass. David doesn't need acid to be a poet. If you ask me, if you want to make anything important, you've got to be willing to go to the very edge. Push yourself. Blow your mind into a million little pieces. How are you man? How's the new record doing? It's just been released in America, actually. It's doing really well. Oh, I'm so happy for you. You just don't quit, even when it all seems so hopeless. Are you a homosexual? Sorry? Have you engaged in homosexual acts or other forms of sexual deviation? Oh gosh. That's a bit personal. Sir, if I judge you to be a sexual pervert, I have the authority to bar you from the entry to the United States. Now, are you a homosexual? No. No, absolutely not. Have you ever been judged to be afflicted with a psychopathic personality, other mental illness, or defects? Sir? No, no. Is this the fag singer? His manager said he did the paperwork. Where in the name of all that is fucking holy is he? - Tony will be here shortly. - You said that two hours ago. - He'll be here. - He's insulting you. Angie, David, Mick, Tony, wonderful to see you. Tony, good of you to make the time. Hope I didn't keep you waiting. Oh, no, not at all. Thanks for putting up with us, by the way. That's a beautiful scarf. The Man Who Sold the World is out there. You know, guys, one thing that I can say with complete certainty and strike me dead if I'm wrong, this David Bowie album is the one that will be judged a masterpiece. A fucking masterpiece. - Thank you. - By posterity. And what exactly does that mean, Tony? Oh, he means that future generations are going to look back on it as a piece of seminal work. Yeah, I know. But what about the present? Oh, we need to talk the album, right? we've gotta break America. As your manager, I could not agree more. So I've been talking to Mercury stateside. Excellent. They find the album, how can I say this? They find it challenging. Well challenging is good. Often it is, but also often, it isn't. Well they released All the Madmen as a single. Mhm, to test the waters. And? Well, how's it doing? Fuckin' hell. You wind up merchant, you absolute bastard. It's fucking charted, hasn't it? It sank. What? They tested the waters and it sunk, it's nowhere. At all? Too dark, too weird for the Yanks. Didn't chart. Well, I mean, that's only one song. Yeah, and it's the wrong song. We chose the wrong single. Maybe. They should be promoting it and spending money. I talked to Lou Reisner at Mercury. He said it's miserable, depressing, obscure. His opinion, not mine. They want you to be more like Bolan. Oh, for fuck's sake. David is David. Yeah, sure. But who is David? What does he stand for? People know what Bolan stands for. Yeah, being a twat. Who are you, David? As an artist? A spaceman? A madman? A laughing dwarf? Gnome, it was a laughing gnome. I don't know. The record company, they don't know. Do you know? You said that posterity... Posterity, maybe one day we'll figure you out. But in meantime, no one else has the patience. Space Oddity was two years ago. Honestly? I'm doing everything that I can to stop Mercury from dropping you. David, we're going to wait outside. No, no, no! Now you listen to me you fucking divot- - No, you listen. Memory of a Free Festival, Prettiest Star, Love You Till Tuesday, Rubber Band. Do I need to go on? 12 singles, every one a total failure except Space Oddity and the Laughing Gnome. Now I believe in David, I always have. You know that. But you have to face reality. There's only one guy at Mercury who doesn't hate your new record with every bone in his body. Well there must be... People don't want records that make them think. Not about psychos and mad houses. That's fucking bullshit. David is an artist. I need you to give me something that I can sell, a Ride a White Swan. If you can't do that, I need to have a person that I can sell. Who likes it? - What? - In America. At the label, you said there's on guy. I can work with him. No, David, it's not going to work. - I'm sorry- - I have to go to America. I need, look, I need, I need! - What? - I need to be known. I need them to know me. I'll make some calls. - A total vote for us. - Really? I have incredible powers of persuasion. - What, America? - Uh huh. A solo tour. I've just performed a miracle, okay? They're gonna put their best publicist on it. Don't look at me like that. I'm telling you, they're gonna roll out that fucking red carpet, American star. Welcome to Washington Dulles International Airport. Right. Hello? Ah. Mr. Bowie, I presume. Hey, man. How are you? Ron Oberman, Mercury Records. Oh, pleasure to meet you. Yeah. What was the hold up in there? Immigration, or what happened? Oh, they didn't like the look of my paperwork. Yeah. I bet they didn't. They said I needed a work visa. Eh, paperwork, smaper-work. - Really? - Yeah, sure. Oh, thank god. You want me to get this for ya? Oh, god, holy crap. What's in here? It's just some of my things. I'm glad you're here, man. Hope that trip wasn't too bad. Oh, god. - What? - I told you we should wait. All right, ma, you were right, you were right. David Bowie, this is my mother. Mother, David Bowie. So nice to me. Real pleasure Mrs. Oberman. Give me your guitar. I hope you're hungry, David. Oh, uh, thank you Mrs. Oberman, but I'll eat something when I get to the hotel. Oh man. Mom's been cooking up a storm all day, in your honor. I made Ron's favorite, kasha varnishkes. That's very kind of you, but- It's no trouble. It's not every day I get to cook for a real star. I'm not quite a star yet, Mrs. Oberman. Sure you are, man. But I wouldn't mind Ron making me one. Ronnie played me your song about the astronaut. Very nice melody. Thank you. So, are you a novelty artist? Space man and gnomes? Shut the fuck up. I hope that what I do is novel. Is that you in the film clip? Spinning around in a space suit? Yes. Yes it was, actually. Well, I'm dying to know, what's the first proper tour date? - Well, we've uh- - Tell him. We got a packed couple weeks coming up, man. We're going to go to Chicago, Philadelphia, New York, and then out to LA. What size is the venue? - Well, it's- - Tell him. All right. You can't play any concerts. What? You don't have a work visa, green card, and there's no musician's union, the paperwork. Look, it's your people in London's fault, not Mercury's. - But can't I just play- - No you can't. You can't, you can't. It's just, you can't play concerts, you can't perform on radio or television. I mean that's why I'm here. I'm playing a promotional tour of America. I know, I know. But it's just with the paperwork you have, all you can do is talk. Talk? Yeah. Yeah, man. You're going to have to talk America into believing you're a big star. Yeah. I mean, Oscar Wilde did it. Dickins did it. But I'm a musician. I know, man. It's not as bad as it sounds. I promise. Will you have some more varnishkes, David? Mrs. Oberman, Mr. Oberman. Michael. I should call my manager now. From my hotel. Yeah, uh, about the hotel. Um... Maybe things'll look better in the morning. Probably not. Come on, man. Things never look better in the morning. Tony said Mercury had doubts about the record. Yeah, well. But that he persuaded them to throw a lot of resources behind the tour. Uh huh, well, managers say a lot of things, don't they? Look, the label gave me very little money. But I think we can make it work. Okay, I don't want to appear ungrateful. Label's got doubts, you know? - That's all. - Clearly. But I don't. You don't? No. I think you're going to be the biggest goddamn star in America. Seriously, man. This is a great record. It's a great record. It's just, no one knows how to sell you in America, all right? They just don't care enough, you know? And you do? Hell yeah, I do. I mean, don't get me wrong, I'm a fucking minority of one but all it takes is one believer to change the world, right? And we got two. Two? You believe in yourself, don't you?

I know when something's troubling my little brother. Well the uh, the new album. - The Man Who Sold the World. - Yeah. It's uh, not everyone's cup of tea. It's art. You don't want everyone to like it. People hated the White Album. I'm going to tour America. This trip's going to change everything. That's what people say. Yeah? Which people? I'm here for you, you know that? Thanks, Terry. - All set? - Yes, thank you. Bye, mom, take it easy. Yeah, you know, all the good ones are up front here, man. Oh, right. So I made some calls today. Worked the goddamn phones a bit and uh, I think I got you some gigs. Oh, I thought the um, the paperwork was... Yeah, well, I mean, these are private parties mostly, but, you know, they'll be in front of the right people, you know? It's not my fuck up, you know? I know. - You sure? - Yep. Good. 'Cause I'm going to get you the cover of Rolling Stone, man. The cover of Rolling Stone? Yeah. It'll be tough to land, but if you do a good interview, get the cover, your career is made. I mean, it's made. Yeah. Here hey are. Hi, thanks for having us. - Hi. - Hi. Welcome. It's so nice to meet you. Ladies and gentlemen, all the way from London, England to entertain you, David Bowie. - Oh don't tell he's singing. - Is that a guy or a chick? Guy's got a fucking dress on. Check him out. Oh, fuck.

You just said that he was useless. Well let's just give him another chance, all right? But you need the best. Angie, please. Angie. Hello? David? Hello? Oh, for fuck's sake. Fuck.

I mean, you know, you know best of course, but, perhaps there's a different way to talk about me when you're on the phone. Okay. I mean maybe, maybe more people would want to meet me if you told them that I was a unique artist, say, who could fill the gap between Elvis and Dylan. Hm. Elvis and Dylan? Gap. So, who do we got in there? Neil Young, James Taylor, Marvin Gaye, Leonard Cohen, the Ohio Players, the Doors, the Velvets, Credence, Johnny Cash, uh, Janis Joplin, Joni Mitchell, every artist on the Motown label. I mean a unique British artist. Right, unique British artists. There aren't too many of those other than Led Zep, Pink Floyd, Deep Purple, Yes. Yep. Pretty Things. Faces. Rolling Stones. Rolling Stones. And then you got bands like the Animals, Cream, the Pretty Things, Faces. Did I say Stones? Yeah Ron, you did, yeah. Um, the Who. Uh, Mark Bolan, T. Rex. Those guys are your buddies, right? Mhm. Hi sir, how can I help you? Hey, uh, I'm looking for a Tom Classon? Oh. Just wait one minute. How can I help you? Jesus Christ, Tom. I've been calling for weeks, looking all over for you. Did you get that album? The David Bowie album? Did you listen to it? - Yeah, yeah. - Great. I listened to it, Ron. Great. When can I get you two to sit down for an interview together? Look I'm, listen, I'm really busy, right now so- - No, no, no, you listen, okay, and listen good, okay? You don't want to miss out on this, man. I mean, this guy's going to be big. Oh yeah. How big is big? Big. What? Like Jerry Reed big or Todd Rundgren big? - Or what are we? - No. - I'm talking like Dylan big. - Fuck you, Ron. I'm serious. This guy is like the English Bob Dylan with avant garde outrage all wrapped together. What, are you reading this off the fucking press release? All right. All right Tom, come on, hey, hey. Don't insult my intelligence. I know a boring British import when I see one. Oh, he is not boring. Oh, why, 'cause he's wearing a dress? I've had it with these face, self-indulgent dandies. I mean, why are you wasting my time with this guy? Space Oddity, fine, but the stuff you're sending me now? Totally off to boil. Seriously, as a friend, you know, why are you still doing this job? Who the fuck knows Tom? All right, they got him a plane ticket, and they gave him my phone number. What, am I gonna leave him at the fucking airport? Okay fine. I'll meet the guy. Great. So, you know, a nice one to watch piece would be good, something like that. Why don't you let me decide that, okay? You just make sure the coffee's fresh. Right. Fresh coffee. Good. Yes. - Hey, Ron? - What? You better be right about this guy. Okay. Just talk about the music, okay? Just talk about the songs, all right? The inspiration, where they come from, okay? They're great songs and they have powerful lyrics and that's what we want 'em to take away. Is it? Damn right is it. Tom Classon. Enchanted. Ron. So , when I first heard Space Oddity, it just blew me away. The atmosphere you created was just mind boggling. Oh, thank you. Thanks. That's why I was shocked to see on the new album that, I mean, Space Oddity, it's so literal and this one is way darker. So tell me, what is that about? Oh, drugs really. Drugs. I mean, I think um, this is probably the most drug oriented album I've ever made, actually. I mean the lyrics, they don't reference drugs at all. See, my take was that it's about insanity. Well, you know, strong hash can really mess with your gourd. The first time I got high, I just got intensely fascinated by the cracks in the pavement. Talk to me about the mask. I mean is this, is this part of your show? Sometimes. It's just the way of concentrating an audience's attention, like um, a Japanese form of movement, like kabuki theater. I think he wants to talk about the record. Right. Right. Uh, the lyrics on the title track The Man Who Sold the World really stood out for me. "Yesterday upon the stair, "I met a man who wasn't there. "He wasn't there again today. "How I wish he'd go away." Sounds a little bit nutty. Oh, it's all just theater really, isn't it? It's um, you know, I originally trained as a mime artist. Really? And what do the audiences in England think of that? Well I, uh, I like to surprise, create a different dimension to a performance. Oh, we just love mime here in America. - Oh really? - Yeah, it's, it is huge. Oh. Would you mind? Yes. Yeah, of course. Uh. No, no. Right. Well, David, this has this, this, this really has been, this has been a pleasure. It sure has. Um. I'll tell you what, you sure do know how to pick 'em. You ready? You feel good? All right, so look, it's not packed, but that's because we didn't make it official, you know. I gotta be honest, though, it's always a pretty cool crowd at this place.

A very charming young man, all the way from London, England, here with his new album, David Bowie. Welcome, sir. Now, uh, we're going to hear a cut from your new album in just a minute, but I wanted to ask you about your influences. What music really excites you back in London? Oh, well my uh, my tastes are pretty eclectic, really. Biff Rose, Ron Davies, um, I've had the new Velvet's LP on nonstop. Yeah, that's wonderful, wonderful. So would you say you're a rock and roll guy at heart? Oh, no. I'm not into rock at all really, I just use it. Honestly, I, I think that rock is the devil's music. Let's in all kinds of lower elements and shadows, you know? Well uh, tell me, tell me about the uh, the new album. What's it all about? Oh, the new album. It's about a particular chapter in my life. It's about the years I spent dressing in women's clothes and getting laid good and hard. Uh well, apologies to listeners of a sensitive disposition. Um, here is uh... Here's another Brit making waves. Fuck. It's T. Rex with Ride A White Swan. Clean? Wholesome? Shark tactics, Ron. You've got to stretch people, get a reaction. Oh, you got a reaction. You got a reaction. That guy's never going to have another one of my artists on, ever. I mean, they may dig that shit in London, but it's different here, man. This is America. You can't just talk dirty on American airwaves. Yeah, right, well, I'm sorry. Yeah. I bet. Where are we? I don't know, man. Rise and shine, I guess. We're somewhere in Ohio. Could have used a navigator. You know how to read a map, don't ya? Hey, what the fuck is hap- Hey, that's my shit. Goddammit. Goddammit. Fuck, man. Oh, gosh. Oh, dear. Oh, I am sorry. Fuck. Oh, I'm, I do hope that wasn't anything important. Yeah. It's my divorce papers, the deed to my house. My whole fucking life, that's all. Oh dear, I am sorry. Oh yeah, I can see that. You know this whole English nice thing doesn't work on me, all right? The whole fluttering lashes ingenue routine, all right, and the little accent. You think this is funny? You think I want to be driving you across this fucking country, working my ass off, getting you on radio, getting you to meet the right people, just so you can fuck it all up? Oh, that's really not fair, you know? Sure it is. It is. Hey, I came here to be a fucking star and now I'm playing little parties and, you know, worthless radio stations talking to absolutely pointless journalists. I mean, you haven't gotten me a single interview with anyone who matters. You can't get me into Rolling Stone. It's delusional. This, this whole tour is a total failure. I feel like I'm a carnival sideshow without the actual carnival. Oh yeah? Well maybe you should rethink the fucking dresses you wear all the time, you know? You want to know what's wrong with this world tour? You wanna know why it's not working? I'll show you. I'll show you why it's not working. Look, you're in America to promote a single called All the Madmen, and it's on an album where every track is about madness. There's an asylum on the fucking sleeve, but do you want to talk about interesting shit? No. And if anyone dares to ask you about your actual work, you just, you know, turn into Coco the fucking clown and do the mystical mime act. And you know what's fucked up, man? You know what's fucked up? Is I liked you, all right? I liked you, but you, you turn out to be just like all the others, man. What other ones? You're all pussies, you fucking artists, you know? You're like, oh Ron, we love you, Ron, thanks Ron, great job, Ron. You know, meanwhile you're on the phone crying like a baby the fucking label. It's Ron's fuck up. Ron fucked it all up. I didn't, I didn't do that. You sent your wife to fire me, David. A week ago. I mean just say it to my face, man. You don't want to work with me. I do. Hey, I do. I do want to work with you. You know what? We have something else in common. I forgot to tell you this, but we do. I also studied mime. Watch, you ready? You watching? Ma'am, I have a collect call from Randolph, Ohio. Will you accept the charges? Of course I'll accept the charges. - David? - Hi. Oh good, you're not dead. Are you calling for a bit of a pep talk then? Yeah, listen, Angie, I did ask you not to say anything about Ron, you know? He's um, he's a bit upset. You know, he thinks I tried to fire him. I've done something wrong, have I? - Uh well- - Well that's fucking great. You navel gazing fucking selfish bastard. Wait, no, no, no, listen- - Yeah, listen. You know what I would like to listen to? I'd like for you to ask me one fucking question, just one, about how your fucking wife is doing. Oh, Ang, how are you doing? And I'd say, oh you know, I'm actually not doing so fucking well. Ang, I've been thinking about you all the time. - It's- - Don't even fucking bother. And for as long as the McCormick's have been breaking horses, Pabst has been making beer, slowly and carefully.

Three of our sisters. Una, Nora, Vivian, and now Terry. It's the bad seed. It's in all of us. Well there's nothing wrong with David, thank God. There wasn't with Terry, either, when he was that age, was there? - Morning. - Hello. Oh. So who are the Stooges, anyway? Are you fucking kidding me? I mean, I thought the show was over. I mean, I think everyone thought the show was over and then Iggy just appeared, like, out of nowhere wearing these silver lamé evening gloves, like he's some kind of fucking prom queen. And then he just dives like a, like a fucking kamikaze right into the audience, man. It was crazy. I mean, apparently before he went on, he had cut himself down his chest with like a piece of glass, but he didn't care, he was just bouncing on top of the crowd, screaming into the mic, just, you know, raw rock and roll, just bleeding everywhere. - Was he really hurt? - Who gives a shit, man? I mean, he didn't care. The crowd was going berserk, man. I mean, he's a freak, but he's just like them, you know? He doesn't care. He doesn't have to hide it. He's just a 100% committed to whatever the fuck he wants to do. What you see is what you get, you know what I mean? I mean just no pretense, no affectation, just pure rock and roll, man. I mean, okay, you know, he was out of his mind on fucking heroin but my point still stands, all right? I mean if you're a 16-year-old kid and you're watching that, he is God, because he is everything you can't be. You know what I'm saying? Definitely the most insane front man on the planet Earth. - Was he really? - Yeah. Have you heard of Vince Taylor? Uh, why do I know that name? He sang that song Brand New Cadillac. Oh, right, yeah, from Louisiana? From West London. And his nickname was the French Elvis, but he, this electric front man. He'd be on the stage, right? Thrashing around, his eyes wild, just incredible. And then one day I saw him outside a station in London and he was crouched on the floor looking over a map and I asked him what he was doing and do you know what he said? He said he said this is where the aliens are going to land to take me away. Finally, I put two and two together and I realized, he's totally off his rocker. Yeah. So, what was wrong with the guy? Who knew. Was it too much acid, not enough? Anyway, two weeks later, he appeared on stage in a white robe and refused to sing and he told the audience that rock music was a lie and that he was an alien god. Oh man. What happened? The crowd nearly lynched him. They just wanted to hear Brand New Cadillac. Of course they did. I am an alien god, my people need me. $7.60. Yeah, okay. We gotta go. Come on. Mickelson's in New York. Who? John Mickelson, man. Rolling Stone Magazine, in New York City right now. Do you think I was making that up? You're doing Rolling Stone tonight.

Get your game face I'll settle them in with a drink, and I'll find us a place. We missed him, by an hour. We missed him? It's a total fucker, man. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Excuse me? Are you Mr. Oberman? Yeah. Uh, Mr. Mickelson left this for you. Yeah, we'll get him in LA. - Really? - I promise. Is this nearby? He wants to meet me, Ron. He knows who I am. I need to see Mr. Warhol. I've been invited. Uh, not you. It's okay, man. Go ahead, I'll be out here. ♪ There a place in our minds ♪ ♪ Where the sun ceases to shine ♪ ♪ And the mountains of our spines ♪ ♪ Are casting shadows ♪ There he is. Are you part of the charm circle now? He didn't even look at me. What'd he say? He said I had nice shoes. What? What'd you do? Did you sing? Oh no, you didn't... I thought I ought to perform, you know? He got someone to film it and then- - Andy Warhol's an asshole. I've been following his work for so long. And I thought if anybody would get me, then Andy would. Fuck that guy. You think he's going to make you a star? You think you need his blessing? I mean, he's a phony scam artist, a fucking vampire. All he does is steal. He's one of the greatest artists. No, he's not. No, he's not. There's better ways to, you know, have a night New York city, man. You know, Lou, everyone says that you guys are a guitar band, but for me, it's the piano that's the real star of the records. I've had your first LP on nonstop since my manager gave me a test pressing. Amazing, blew me away. That wasn't him. What? I'm telling you, that wasn't Lou Reed. He left the Velvets three months ago. Then who the hell was I talking to? Doug Yule. He's been playing the part for months, just holding the band together. But he told me all about how he wrote Waiting for the Man. Yeah. You didn't even think to tell me? I'm sorry, man. You were just so excited. And to be fair, Doug does a pretty good Lou impersonation. You know what? I don't even care that he was fake. Why? Well, you know, a rock star or somebody impersonating a rock star, what's the difference? There's a huge difference. Welcome to Los Angeles where the time is 4:43 in the afternoon. Okay, the thing to remember about LA is that they love an exotic Englishman out here, all right? They're going to be endless kissing your ass and promising you the world. Yeah, sounds awful. Just remember, it's not reality, all right? This is an insane, fucked up city of lies. It's like rock candy mountain or the fun fair in Pinocchio. Yeah, man. They're going to turn you into a donkey, man. All right, just be careful. Keep your head on. All right. Thanks, dad. So, got a message from Mickelson. Uh huh? He's going to meet us at that RCA guys party tomorrow night. - All right. - It's happening, David. Rolling Stone, man. - It's real. - Oh. - It's happening. - Right. Wow. Also I uh, I got you a present. Oh. Thank you. What is it? It's a guy we signed in '68, the legendary Stardust Cowboy. Oh, cool. Yeah, I try to help him out every now and then. None of the other press guys at Mercury will touch him, really. Why not? Well, you know about a minute in he starts wailing like fucking lunatic, this complete nut job. Is it meant to be funny? Oh no, no. He's deadly serious. Thinks he's got a genuine shot at the big time, that guy. Oh. Anyway, always room in rock and roll - for a bit more crazy, right? - Right. All right. I'll see you in the morning. Okay. Thanks, Ron. ♪ I'm a sleepwalker, baby ♪ Hey man. - Hey, Ron. - How's it goin'? - Welcome. - Thanks, pal. David Bowie, Brandon from RCA Records. This is a great honor. Hey, come on, let's start. Let me show you around. Yeah, there's this one thing that I don't get. How come you're not a huge star? Oh wow. Maybe it's your label. Well, Mercury haven't been the best. What's your P and A spending like? The what? - Press and advertising. - Oh, not much, I'd say. Hey listen, you should really think about RCA. I'm serious. The only big thing they got right now is Elvis, and he's not going to be around forever, you know what I mean? - Do you think they'd have me? - In a heartbeat. They should be so lucky. They'd be lucky to have me. I could be the next King. - Oberman. - Hey, John. - Been too long. - Hey, man. I appreciate you coming out. I owe you one, man. You do if he's the reason I sat in a cab for 45 minutes. Now wait a second. - I, I think you're gonna- - No, no. How many times have I fucking told you people we won't cover another flower power limey crossing the pond five years too late? Can you just give me, like, five- - Man, you've been shoveling this shit for too long. Maybe it's time you got out. Found something real yourself. Well maybe I have. Come on, he looks like Lauren fucking Bacall. Actually he prefers a latter day Garbo, - but I get your point, John. - Do you, though? I mean all this counterculture shit leaves you cold. Actually no, that's not true, all right. Listen to me. There's, there's something different about him. Is it the periwinkle eyeshadow? No man. And you know what your fuckin' problem is? You're jaded and you might not be able to see when a kid's got something, might really do something, John. Okay. Okay, jeez. I'm just saying he better do it soon. I'm catching the next red eye to New York in a couple of hours. Hey, come on, you're a music hack. Isn't every flight a red eye? Look, just talk to him. That's all I'm asking. Okay, so, where do I find him? Okay. I'll, uh, hold on. You need to get me out of here. Oh, thank fucking god. Terry. You all right? Have you got any smokes? Yeah. I thought you'd forgotten about me. As if. Yeah. You need to get me out of here. Seriously, David, - Well- - I'm begging ya. Look at these people. I'm not like them. I haven't got any of this, have I? No. Hey, David. David. He's ready for you, man. - And David? - Yeah? Please. No fucking miming. Okay? All right. David. I'm sorry, can you repeat the question? I was asking a simple question, who or what is David Bowie? Well, uh, Dave Bowie is the image and David Jones is me, but uh, David Bowie is not a false person. I mean, I am also David Bowie. Feels a little schizophrenic to me. I mean um... You said he's only had one major psychotic episode, but I see from the notes that your brother's had quite a few violent outbursts. No, Terry wouldn't hurt a fly. Your mother said he attacked her husband, John Jones. My dad, yeah. I mean, they had a big row once. Him and Terry didn't get along so well. How long do you think he needs to stay here for? Depends how he responds to the drugs. Could be a few months, could be much longer. And from the family history, I think Terry may be quite far along the spectrum. There's a spectrum? Schizoid spectrum. Usually we see a progression - starting with mild psychosis- - Like what, for example? Personality disorder. Feeling disconnected from your surroundings. Compulsive sexual behavior, disordered speech, those sort of symptoms. Do you have trouble separating fantasy from reality? Um, well, I mean, I don't want to um, I don't want to climb out of my fantasies to um, go up on stage. I want to, I want to take them out there with me. Okay, so, if I'm at one of your concerts, what am I getting? A fantasist? A tart. - What? - A harlot. This is how you see your role as an artist? Yes. I mean well I, I think that music should be tarted up. It should be, should be made into a prostitute, a parody of itself. A parody? Yes, yes, well I think music should be the, um, should be the clown, should be the Pierrot. Pierrot? The pantomime fool? I mean only that um, well that music is the mask that the message wears and I, I, the performer, yeah, I am the message. I'm sorry. What is the message? What I want to nail here is what's the one constant? What's the, the thing you carry into every song, concert? It's like, um... It's like a uh... A bad seed. I mean, it's in my genes, isn't it? It's passed down in families, yes. It doesn't mean it's genetic. Sorry. I didn't quite follow, doc. Terry was raised by his grandmother when he was little, is that right? Granny Margaret, yeah. She was a tough, old boot. And there was other daughters who were schizophrenic? Yeah, three of my aunts. Auntie Una had a lobotomy. Drilled right into her brain. There's a new theory. Schizophrenia may be triggered by traumatic rejection, you know, when parents reject their children? Either in childhood or adolescence. What about audiences rejecting performers? I don't think there's been a paper written on that. Okay. All right, so uh, did you get what you need? Oh yeah. ♪ My death waits like ♪ ♪ An old roué ♪ ♪ So confident I'll go his way ♪ ♪ Whistle to him ♪ ♪ And the passing time ♪ ♪ My death waits like a Bible truth ♪ ♪ At the funeral of my youth ♪ ♪ Oh, we drink for that ♪ Geez. Bloody hell. David! David, Jesus, don't. Oh god, thank fucking god. You're alive. I don't need to worry? You know, my brother, Terry the one in the merchant navy? Well he's uh, he's not in the merchant navy. He's in an asylum. - I'm sorry, buddy. - Yeah. The dirty secret. Madness in the family. Generation after generation, behind the net curtains and, well, I'm scheduled to be next. I don't want to go mad. I've made other plans. Well, listen, this fucking business can make the most sane people feel like they're fucking nuts. It's not the music business, Ron. It's, I mean, I can, I can put it in a song, right? But you expect me to go across America talking about it, saying oh hello, I'm David Bowie and I happen to be going stark raving mad. That fucking terrifies me. I never told you you had to do that. Yes you did. You've been telling me to do that ever since I arrived. Be authentic. Tell the truth. Be yourself. All of these bloody authentic musicians you like, there is no authentic me. It's just... Fear and voices. I mean, you know who you are. Right? That's that's something to envy. Don't. It's overrated. Well, look, you know, it's not that hard, really. I mean, if you can't be yourself... Well, I can't, can I? Well then be someone else. Be someone else. - Who? - I don't fucking know. Well, thank you. That was extremely unhelpful. I know. I'm just a publicist. You're the fucking artist. Sir? Your drink. Hi, folks. We're not expecting much in the way of turbulence for your flight to London, England tonight. Flight time, 12 hours and 35 minutes. We should have you on the ground around 10 AM. David? What the fuck did they do to you? It's happening. What's happening? What happened to Terry. No. No, it's not David. No. No, no. It's not happening, all right? You just need rest. You just need some rest, that's all. Terry darling, it's really not a good time. Hello Terry. Back from your holidays? You could have sent me a postcard. - Terry. - I was expecting a postcard. Or did you forget about me? Did they discharge you? Nah. Did a runner. Wanna see if my little brother got back in one piece. I wanted to hear the great tidings. Did we crack America, Davie? What do you mean, Terry? All the Madmen. That's us. The madmen. Terry. David's just gotten home and he's shattered. I'm shattered! You're shattered? The whole fucking world is shattered. It's okay. You're not well. You need to go back. - I'll take him. - No, David. Come in. Terry, I can't. Of course you can. Nothing to be afraid of. Oh, the prodigal returns. Let me call off the search party. I'm going to get going. - Angie, you know. - Oh, Terry. Your Jemima's here. Come and watch, please. - You'll like it. - No, I'm gonna- - Terry, why don't you just join 'em in the ward. I'll talk to your brother. He's right, you know. You should stay and watch. Watch what? Let me show you. This way. We've heard so much about you. Terry says you're back from a tour of America. Yeah. There's some fascinating work on psychiatry coming from the east coast. Well, of course we do interesting work here as well. It's probably worth your while hanging around. In Cane Hill? Don't need to look so alarmed. We have a new therapist, and Terry is really taken with her. Look, I'm certain that with your background, you'll find what she does absolutely fascinating. Come on. Your brother really enjoys her sessions which, well it's such a surprise that he eloped. I don't think I want to go in. Look, it's a new idea. It's called drama therapy. Essentially it means you discharge your psychosis by pretending to be someone else. If you even lay one fucking finger on him again, I'll beat you 'til next Saturday. Do you understand? How about you, Terry? Have you thought about who you'd like to be today? Anybody you'd like. Who would you like to be? A singer. Well all right. Any specific singer? Frank Sinatra? Marty Wilde?

I don't know! It's just, there's bits and pieces. Bits and pieces. What do you want from me? What do I want? What do I want? What do you think I want David? We were supposed to be rewriting the rules together, destroying marriage in its old form, sort of resurrecting this new equality. Two equals, two shining stars. Not ignored, invisible, inconsequential, a fucking broodmare. You weren't there for me. What? In America? Yeah. Sometimes I would call you, right, - and you weren't- - I wasn't there? Oh, I wasn't sitting next to the phone or submissive. Docile, just waiting for you to call. Fuck you, David. We were supposed to be king and queen. Not master and fucking slave. That's it. I'm done. It's over, David. That's it, it's fucking over. That's it! No it isn't. Bloody hell. Listen, I've got all these American music hacks. 50 of them. I've brought America to you. So I want to bring a few of them backstage. Quick peek behind the curtain. No. David, RCA paid for them to fly across the Atlantic to meet you. - I said no. - For fuck's sake, why not? Aliens don't mingle, Tony. No fucking way. Mick. You agreed. It's like, um, like a gang right? Like the Clockwork Orange. Just a little bit less scary, so, Freddie and I picked these colors just for you, right, so, oh, blue for you and your gorgeous hair. This is, oh, this might be my favorite. You're fucking joking me. Takes a real man to wear pink and pull it off. And Mick gets gold. No, no, no, no, no, no. Oh, fuck's sake. What are you doing, Mick? Going home. 'Cause this is fucking silly. You know what, it doesn't go down well in Hull. - Hull? - That's right. But we've never played in Hull. Last time you dressed as a fairy on TV, some buster threw a potted plant in me dad's house. Okay, all right, but Mick, but Mick, the music. The music's fine, David. I'd go so far as to say the music's fucking brilliant. So why do we gotta dress like some puff's pantomime? I mean, look at you, you're gonna be a fucking laughing stock. No one'll her the music. They'll just see some fucking clown. You're ruining it. If this is such a good idea, why hasn't Robert Plant done it, or Daltrey, or Jagger? It's bollocks, mate. You are not a space alien. Oh yes I am. You are not an alien. You're from Bromley, man. What's so fucking funny? What are you fucking laughing at, David? Woo hoo. Aren't we picture perfect? Are you doing touches on the others? Oh, there's so many kids out there. There's incidents occurring. - Is Mick wearing the- - Yeah, he's wearing it. Good. Thanks, Angie. Good luck, darling. Come on. David? Hey, David? Oh my God. Fuckin' look at you, man. You're real. Yeah, the last time I checked. I wouldn't miss it for the world, buddy. Oh yeah. Wow. I told you, all it takes is one believer. And we've got two. Two?
