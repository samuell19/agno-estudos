It's vacant. - It's vacant? - Yeah. Oh, yeah. I anyway just wanted to stretch a bit. By the way, thank you. Thank you for not letting me fall. Oh. And I'm really sorry for what came next. Purely coincidental, unintentional, but I'm glad I did it. I mean I'm glad I didn't let you fall. So, when does the flight land? You seem in a hurry? Important work? No, I am flying back home. Got a few days off after a long time. Why is that? What's so important about your work? I work for the Indian Army. Lies. Believe me now? Nice. Done with the stretching? No. You want some juice? No, thank you. So, how long have you been working as a cabin crew? Three years. You like it? See, I'm from a conservative family from Muscat, with a middle-class background. This job allows me to travel for free and keeps me away from The conservative thoughts. And you wanna know the best part? I get to see something new, every single time. New people, new perspectives. New experiences. Life will try to hold you down, but this journey must always go on. It's beautiful. Are you okay? Yeah. Is everything okay? Okay. - Sorry. - Does this keep happening? Yes, there's often some turbulence on this route. I mean... does THIS happen often? Sir, the... seat belt sign is on. Okay. Hello. The seat belt sign is on, sir. Yes. Go. Okay. There's a restaurant right outside the airport. Have a coffee with me. Are you crazy? Go back to your seat. I don't even know your name. Arjun Shergill. And yours? A yes ha. A yes ha. Full name? Just A yes ha. Like Madonna. Oh, pleasure to meet you. And you too, Beyonc*. Coffee? No! Please go back to your seat. We're flying into turbulence. What about the turbulence in my heart? Oh... - so cheesy! - I'll wait for you. Just go back to your seat, soldier. I'll be waiting, you tell her. Hi. Hi. You have no idea how many rules I'm breaking to meet you. You won't regret it.

Arjun? - Where's A yes ha? - Huh? - What? - Where's A yes ha? Who? A yes ha. I'll go get the doctor. We extracted the bullet, but the fall has injured your spin. Vertebrae C1 and C2 have broken. That's why you're paralyzed from the neck down. ...and as a result you only have slight movement in your right hand. How long will it take for me to recover? Like I said, C1 and C2 Vertebrae are damaged- I heard you, Doctor. When will I be back on my feet? Arjun. Let him finish. Arjun, this... paralysis is permanent. Permanent? How can it be permanent?

More than 300 people had died in this attack. According to our sources, SeT is behind this attack. It was masterminded by Hamid Gul. He is intrepidly running terror camps in PoK. Mr. Sachin. Mr. Devanshu. We should keep politics out of this. But the government is doing politics over it. 'Don't.' 'Leave.' The question of the hour: What is our government doing to protect our country? Don't you think we should ask this question? I think the government is answerable to the people. I think the government needs to answer all questions related to the security of our country right away. Everyone's here? Let's start the meeting. Sit, sit. Please sit down. What intelligence do we have on SeT? Sir, we're in the dark about three people in the SeT inner circle, but what we do know is Hamid Gul has taken over the leadership of Lashkar. This is the only existing photograph we have of Hamid. We had arrested his father Rehman Gul a couple of years back. An Oxford-educated computer engineer. A modern-day terrorist. His followers treat him like a messiah, sir. They are brainwashed and trained like elite soldiers. They have it engraved in their mind that there will be no peace in their land as long as India exists. How do we tackle him? Sir, I recommend a full-blown operation. That would mean war. This isn't the right option. I agree. Terrorists have wised up after our last operation. Now they run their terror camps in civilian areas. We have another option, sir. Super Soldier program. Come on, Mr. Subramanium, why do you keep insisting on discussing the same old thing? Because it's important and I continue to believe it is going to work. When peace talks fail and war isn't an option, science always comes to the rescue. What exactly do you have in mind? Artificial Intelligence. An artificially intelligent super soldier... can destroy such terrorist camps singlehandedly, that too without any collateral damage. Looks like you watch too many Hollywood films. Yes, I love Hollywood films. Do you know where the first armed military drone was used? October 7, 2001, Kandahar. It was a US military drone- Wrong. 1980, the movie 'Star Wars' featured the world's first drone. Today's fiction is tomorrow's reality. Not just us, but every advanced nation in the world - America, China, Israel, are all working on such intelligent soldier programs. You will look at them and go: "How wonderful!" "Superb!" "So cool!" But you find it hard to believe when Indian scientists work on it. Because of our inferiority complex, we Feel that they're better than us. But I have news for you. They are not. We come second to none. We have young and dynamic scientists who know this. They are confident, bold, and daring. Our super-soldier program head, Sabah Qureshi. She has been working with RDO for the last seven years. And they are on a verge of a major breakthrough. There's no doubt in my mind, that future wars will be.. Won using artificial intelligence and not arms and artillery. And India has to be there first. It's time to revolutionize the Indian Army. Sir, we are ready for human trials. - We just need a go-ahead from you... - By 'humans' you mean our soldiers? One soldier. Mr. Subramanium, are you suggesting we run experiments on our soldiers? Use them as lab rats? Sir, we are not going to take any steps without the soldier's permission. And me and you very clearly know peace talks, border skirmishes, surgical strikes haven't changed anything. What I am suggesting will put an end to the entire terrorist community and not just Hamid Gul. For how long will we resort to counteracting? It's time we ATTACK! It's time for one final ATTACK! You get on with it. I'll handle him. Let go. Push him off the chair. How dare you bite me! How dare you! Let him go. Let go. My son's... Let me go. Help! Help! Shut up! Zip it. I'll kill you. Shut up! - I'll kill her. - No, no. - Let's go, bro. - Get the things. Stay quiet! Shut up! - Take whatever you want. - I'm done. Let's go. - Give me your ring. - No! Or I'll chop off your finger. Should I chop off your finger and take it? Let's go, bro. I'm done. Let's go. Oh, my God. Arjun? You okay? Are you okay? Are you okay, Mom? Yes, I am fine. I am okay. You are okay? Yeah? Come on... Get up. Get up. Mom... I am sorry, Mom. They are physically fit soldiers, sir. Sabah, you are aware of the terror around. Situation has changed. Sir, with all due respect, I didn't develop this technology for warfare. It is meant to give new life to paralyzed people. If we implant this into a healthy person, he can get paralyzed for life and it's... Sabah, Prime Minister has approved it. I get it. I know this is very important. And the RDO is backing, I am very grateful for that, but this is not what we spoke about. I cannot forget my morals. I am sorry, I can't do this. Sabah, will you give us a minute? Sure. What's the problem? Just kick her out of the project. She is the project, sir. We can't move without her. Then just find a paralyzed soldier, there has to be one somewhere. Arjun, you have a guest. Shergill. How are you doing? I'm very busy, sir. - Very hectic. - Hmm. Would you like some tea? - Mom? - Uh-huh? He takes it with sugar, one teaspoon. Thanks, Mom. Someone's chewing gum instead of smoking. I quit. Very impressed. What brings you here? The last you checked on me was a year back. Hamid Gul. We need to get him. Believe me, sir, Hamid would be dead by now if I wasn't in a wheelchair. But all I can say is good luck. I'm not here for your best wishes. I need you back. Back in what? Army. With all due respect sir, this isn't funny anymore. And I am damn serious. You know, we... Thank you. We have developed a computer chip. And it's revolutionary. It can change your life. We'll implant this computer chip into your body and you'll be back on your feet again. Impossible. Doctors said that the damage is irreversible. I won't be able to walk again. Should I believe in Medical science or your 'SIM Card'? This 'SIM Card' will not only help you walk again it will also give you the ability to run, to fight. It will give you the strength you have never experienced before. You will be the world's first Super Soldier. - But sir... - You'll get all the answers, But, I need mine first. Why me, sir? We need a soldier who has nothing to lose. It's an invasive surgery. Survival chances are slim 50-50? 20-80. Not bad. Details of the procedure are in this file. Read it. I'll wait for your call. This guy will never change. He used to drop in unannounced to meet your father as well. What was he here for? Didn't you say that everything will be fine? Looks like God has finally answered your prayers. There are around 65 million people in a wheelchair in the world. Our dream was to help them get back on their feet with the help of a brain-machine interface. Innovators like Elon Musk have been experimenting on this for a couple of years. Now what you see here is real-life footage of an American patient from 2016 who underwent a similar procedure. So ours is a three-part process. Part One: A robotic precision arm will implant bionic chips into your brain. The neural threads of these chips will read your brain signals. Part Two: A microcomputer will be placed in your neck to decode these signals. And third: Nano wireless electrodes. They will be injected into your limb muscles, thereby completing the brain-machine interface by-passing your injured spinal cord. So, for example, if you want to move your hand. The chip will read your brain signal, the computer will decode it and pass the information to the electrodes. Resulting in, hopefully, the movement of your hand. You already know the risks. But I still have to ask, are you ready for this? You know what you need to do if I don't survive this? We'll ensure that your mother is taken care of. I'm ready. Ma'am, his body temperature is rising. There's internal bleeding, ma'am. He's at 102. I need more time. You don't have time. Just a little more time. He's at 105! What's wrong? His body temperature is rising. We'll have to stop the procedure or else he'll die. Okay, pulling out the robotic arm... No. The procedure continues. He knows the risks. Continue. Continue. CONTINUE. He's stabilizing. Arjun? My head's hurting. That's absolutely normal. Your nervous system is trying to connect with the chip. It'll subside after some time. It's... it's unbearable. - I think we should sedate him. - No, no, no. The chip and the brain need to establish a connection. Arjun, you have to bear this pain. Try to divert your attention. How? Try moving your hand? - Come on. - Arjun... focus harder. I'm focusing. I can't move it. - The pain's unbearable. - It's okay. It's... it's okay. Take some rest. We can try again after some time. My head's killing me. Unbelievable. Sit up. What's this voice that I hear? I.R.A. I.R.A.? Intelligent Robot Assistant. The 'Chip' inside you. She is your personal assistant who'll only follow your commands. Just like Siri, Alexa, and Google Home. Hello. I'm I.R.A.. First-generation neural AI version 1.1. Deep learning at 51 Tera Operations Per Seconds. At your service. Would you like to stand up? Great. System error, neural bonding in progress. His muscles are still weak. It will take him some time to adapt. Recalibrating. "Not just the ground, I want to rule the sky." "I will break everyone around, but I won't break." "Not just the ground, I want to rule the sky." "I will break everyone around, but I won't break." "God has gifted me with a new spirit." "I want to spread my wings and..." Arjun! Are you okay? - Yeah. - Are you okay? Yeah. Yeah. Again. "I won't break today." "I just won't." "I will break all boundaries today." "I won't break today." "I just won't." "I will do the impossible today." "I won't break, my friend." "I won't break, my friend." "I will do the impossible today." Bad shot. You missed the target by six inches. Did I ask for your opinion? No. Still bad, we need to sync 100%. "I'll kill you or die trying." "I'll kill you or die trying." "I'll crush you." "I'll kill you or die trying today." "Nothing can stop me today." Don't over think, Arjun. What do you mean? Trust your reflexes and I.R.A. will handle the rest. "I won't break today." "I just won't." Sir, this is solid intel. Hamid is procuring chemical weapons in Eastern Europe. "I won't break, my friend." "I won't break, my friend." "I will do the impossible today." "Attack!" He's a fighter. Connect him to the system. No sir, I don't think he's ready yet. He needs more time. We don't have time. - Just connect him. - Sir... This is the government mainframe. Restoring the body movement was the first step. Now comes the exciting stuff. What exactly are we doing? We're making you the Big Boss. Connect him. I.R.A. will always stay connected to this government mainframe via satellite link. Through which you'll have access to government data, criminal records, Interpol files, intelligence, tactical skills. It's like you have a FASTag for tolls? Oh, this is amazing, but... But? Why is it pink? I like pink. But I can change the color if you want. How's this? Much better. Boys will be boys. Stop, stop, stop. What did you see? Toggle back. Stop. It's nothing. I know what you're thinking. Good, but stop reading my mind. I command you. Invalid command. It is my job to read your mind. Really? Then take a good look at this picture. I need his address. 235, Nehru Place. Why do you need it? I'm taking you for a test drive. How exciting! Yeah? Now play some music. Target identified. Yo, dude. What do you want? The ring. Weren't you in a wheelchair? You've packed some muscles, dude. It's sick! Searching "Boht Hard!" Slang for very impressive. I want the ring back. Wait. Bring me his mother's ring. Here. It comes with a price tag of 100,000, but I'll give it to you for just 60,000. Here. Let's close the deal at 600. That's it? Your mother's ring is worth so little? No, this is what you'll need for the hospital visit later. - Get up, bro. - Hey! Wait right here. You're a dead man walking, you bastard. You're emotional. Do you like jewellery? Stop. Stop. Hedonistic psychological patterns observed. Threat level high. We should leave. Shh, I.R.A.. I don't need you right now. - You scoundrel. - Don't talk, just watch. Fine, have it your way. I.R.A., why is my arm locked? It was your command. You said you didn't need me. "Don't talk, just watch." I.R.A., learn to distinguish between instructions and expressions. Sometimes an expression can have two different meanings. Is he mental? Humans are so confusing. We need to talk more. Yes, we will, but let's deal with them first. Sure. Activating Combat Mode. 50 stitches required. Whoa! How did you do that? Simple. I downloaded it from the internet. Downloaded it? Yes, Super Soldier can download any fighting skill in the world from the mainframe. Really? What else can we do? Shh! "Don't talk, just watch." Hey! Uh-oh, he shouldn't have done that. Leveling up. Activating Super Combat Combo Two. In three, two, one. And that's a knockout. Switching back to civilian safety mode. Calculating damage. 12 injured, no fatalities. Checking vitals. All normal. Neural bonding intact. Congratulations. I guess our first test drive was a success. Or maybe not. I.R.A., we have to escape at any cost. I can't get caught. - You got it? - Copy that. - Turn left. - Left. Okay. Then? Jump! No, no, no! Are you serious? Affirmative. It's my job to stay serious. Police. - What? - 20 meters away. Huh? Don't we have any other option? Negative. This is the best option. See that garbage truck? Soft and safe landing. Great. Garbage truck. Remember, we do this together. No hesitations. Total sync is needed. Okay. Okay. Initiating jump. I.R.A.? Overriding. "We need to escape at any cost." I.R.A., no!!! Happy birthday to you! - Happy birthday to me! - Happy birthday to you! - Happy birthday to you! - Happy birthday to me! ...and many-many-many more birthdays to come. - Thank you. - All with me and not on duty. Of course. Such a liar. Wake him up. Wake him up. You said this was a minor glitch. Then why is it taking so long? - I.R.A. is not the problem. - Then what is the problem? I told you he's not ready. I.R.A. will be restricted until he moves on from his past trauma. You know, the two most important days of our life... ...are the day we are born... ...and the day we find out why? Do you know what were you born to do? No. Do you? Since a long time. And what is that? For you. What just happened? Nothing. The chip malfunctioned because of the head injury. Your brain powers I.R.A.. I.R.A. shuts down once you become unconscious. I've been stimulating your brain with artificial neuron signals for four hours. Thankfully I.R.A. booted up and came online. What if this happens again and you are not around? Then you'll have to wake up on your own. But that dream looked quite real. I thought I was awake. You see, you are our first human subject. We too are witnessing these patterns for the first time. On Standby Mode, I.R.A. acts like a desktop screen saver. She will show you visuals from your past memories. But, to come out of it, you'll have to be the one to press 'Enter' Am I making sense? And what if I cannot distinguish between the dream and the reality? Then... deep coma. You might never come out of it. But relax, all will be well. Alert! All is not well. Noted. Sir. Just give me ten minutes. What was the emergency that made you break the protocol? Please enlighten me. I'm sorry sir, I got excited and things got out of control- Then learn to control yourself! If you can't do this, we can give this chip to another responsible soldier. - No. I like you, Arjun. - Shut up. What? I mean it won't happen again, sir. - Can I trust you, soldier? - Yes, sir. I didn't hear you. - Is he deaf? - Shut... I mean, yes sir. Tomorrow, Sabah and I'll be going to the parliament to submit your progress report to the Defense Minister. But I think you are still not ready for Hamid. It's Hamid who isn't ready for me, sir. So dramatic. No more. Stop. Okay. Hey, are you done? Almost done, sir. How much time do we have? Sir, real RAF trucks will reach here in 15 minutes. We need to reach there before that. Shit, they have a double verification system. Sir, we'll have to hack into the parliament's server. Please inform Wakas. Wakas, come in. - Yes, Brother? - Deploy it, Wakas. Over. - Good morning, ma'am. - Good morning. Photo ID, please. Check it. - You may proceed, ma'am. - Thank you. Visitor's parking is on the left side. Let me go! Let go of me! If you want to see them alive, then it's better if my men stay out of your house. Drive fast, Raju. Meeting's scheduled for today, not tomorrow. - Hello? - Sabah? I'm getting a bit late. - Just wait for me. - Yeah, sir. Hurry up. We have orders. Check it. Clear, sir. Control Room? Officer Mehta, I need confirmation for RAF to be allowed inside the Parliament. This is confirmation. Delhi is on high alert. So RAF has been approved for the Parliament. Over. Hello? Is the jammer on? Yes, sir. Does RAF have permission to come inside? - No. - Check it. Greetings, Brother. Greetings. How are you? Good. Careful with that. What are you guys doing here? We are ready. We are ready as well. Nobody moves until PM arrives. We don't have that kind of time, Brother. Real RAF trucks are already there. Wait. Who's A yes ha? Awaiting reply. I ask the questions. I am the boss here. Of course, boss. But A yes ha is occupying too much space in your mind. It is hindering with our connection. So, what should I do? Help me understand A yes ha. A yes ha was the love of my life. Love: An intense feeling of deep affection for someone. Detecting intense feelings. Does that mean you love Hamid Gul as well? More than you can imagine. Sweet. You can meet him. He is not too far away. What do you mean? I mean he's at 28.38* North, 77.13* East. It can't be. These coordinates Are in Delhi. Yes, Parliament of India. Hamid is there. What? Are you sure? Affirmative. 100% match. Yes? We have orders to go inside. I know. How many more trucks are expected? I let a couple of RAF trucks in just a couple of minutes ago. But none of our trucks have gone inside as yet. Good morning, sir. Good morning, sir. PM's here. Come out. Move.. Move.. Move fast. - Hamid's going to attack the Parliament. - What? - Hamid is going to attack the Parliament!! - When? Right now. Down! Down! Take cover! Help the forces. Patrol One. Patrol One, come in. Do you have the PM? He's getting away. These guys in RAF uniforms are not RAF. They are terrorists. Back off! Back off! Take cover! Move, move, move. - Get out of our way! - Move aside. Move! This way, this way. Go inside. - Hurry. - Emergency exit, clear. Going for the elevator. I have the PM. Let's go. Mr. Prime Minister. Who are you? Hamid Gul. Breaking news coming in right this minute. A terrorist attack on the Parliament of India. This is believed to be the biggest ever terrorist attack on India. The stock market of India has shut down and there is confusion and chaos on the streets of Delhi. The President of the United States has condemned the attack. Government officials are being evacuated as we speak. According to our sources, Prime Minister was last seen entering the building to attend the Parliament Session. But we have no news of whether he is safe or not. NSG commandos are being dropped off at ground zero as we speak. A high-level war room has been set up to get the situation under control. The question of the hour is: Who will be the acting Prime Minister? Okay, guys, I want everybody's attention here. We are short of time so let's get straight to the briefing. What do we know so far? LeT terrorists attacked the Parliament around 11 o'clock. It's estimated that there are around 100 of them. They have sneaked their own arms and ammunition inside the building. And now have control over the entire inner complex of the Parliament. How many hostages? More than 300, including the Prime Minister. Any contact from inside? None. We've not been able to contact anyone since 10 minutes after the siege. Everyone's phones have been switched off. Is Parliament's outer perimeter secured? Affirmative. We have surrounded the building from all sides, and our tactical response team is about to take a position on the rooftop of the Parliament via choppers. There's no way anyone is getting out of that building without us knowing. Clearly, this is a huge national emergency. As per the Constitution of India, the senior-most member of the... Cabinet takes over command in the absence of the Prime Minister, and the powers of the Prime Minister will be transferred to him. And the Honorable President has appointed. Home Minister Digvijay Saab as our Caretaker Prime Minister. Yes, sir. Please. I assure everyone that I will stay dedicated to this responsibility. - I request everyone... - What? Terrorists want to communicate. And they are online. Okay guys, stand by. Patch the call. Patching the call. Greetings. This is Hamid Gul speaking. All your guards are dead. And I have held your PM hostage. I have planted enough bombs across the building, Enough to blow the ministers to pieces. So, don't even try to get in. I have just three demands. Fulfill them and I will leave. My first demand: Call back your tactical team that has been hovering over our heads. You have ten minutes. In exchange, I'll release 50 hostages. You want them dead or alive, you decide. Keep me. Let the others go. Who do you think you are? Your VIP days are over. I'm the one who rules this building now. I am more powerful than your Prime Minister. The one who rules over this place... rules over the entire country. Alpha.. Rappelling down. Alpha has landed. Ready for assault. It's not a bad deal. He's releasing 50 people. Ask the commandos to come back. They are not needed there. I beg to differ, sir. We don't negotiate with terrorists. Let's send the tactical team inside and kill the bastards. We cannot take that risk. Prime Minister is in there as well. The whole cabinet is in there. 300 people who run this country. One wrong decision and it will all be over. I think he is right. He is one step ahead. And we need time to perform a proper army action. We don't know where he has planted the bombs. If we send the army blindly, There's going to be a bloodbath. So you want us to accept a terrorist's demand? No, no. No, never. But what if we perform a partial extraction? Hamid knows that there are commandos on the rooftop. But he doesn't know how many of them. So let's accept his demand. Let him assume that we have given up. We will leave just one commando behind. He will provide us with intel from inside the Parliament. And then we can plan a proper army action based on that intel. We are getting time. Will he release the hostages if we do this? He will, sir. We are accepting his demand. Fine. Which soldier do you plan on leaving behind? - Sir. - Your squad has been compromised. Hamid knows that you guys are up there. He has threatened to blow up the Parliament, unless you get out of there. Shit. - Do you want us out? - Yes and no. Do a partial extraction. You stay back and let the other commandos retreat. You need to get inside the building and provide us with intel. - Do you think it is possible? - Yes, sir. - I.R.A. can guide me. - Good. Call back the chopper and put on a loud show. New channels are desperate to show some drama. I just want Hamid to believe that NSG is gone. Copy that. And we're getting you these latest images coming in from the Parliament attack site, where the NSG choppers are retreating... We're not sure about why the government took this decision but we do know that Home Minister Digvijay Singh is in charge right now. Check the rooftop. Okay, Brother. Check everywhere. Keep an eye. Nobody is here. I.R.A., is there a place where I can hide? AC vent, 3 o'clock. Switching to Stealth Mode. All clear, Brother. - Hussain? - Yes, Brother? Release 50 hostages. We have live footage of 50 hostages being released. They are rushing out of the Parliament complex as you can see. But the terrorists still have control of the Parliament with 300 hostages inside. I've given charge of the CCTV room to Iqbal, Brother. Okay. Kill anyone who is hiding. Okay, Brother. Arjun, what's your status? - I'm in. - Excellent. Now listen, can you hack the CCTV system and give us access to the live feed? - I am sure I.R.A. can. - Good. Get on it. I.R.A., I want blueprints of the Parliament. Projecting 3D model of the Parliament. Identify camera blind spots for me. Identifying. The Metro job will be done in three hours. And how long will this take? Two are online, four more are left. Their Army will strike before you are done. They won't. How can you be so sure? Do you know the reason behind frequent military coups back home? No. Because our military knows the government holds no power. Their military is foolish. They will do as told by the ministers. And as long as we hold their PM hostage, their Home Minister won't even let the military kill a fly. Sir, 50 hostages are out, unharmed. Should I tweet this on your behalf? Go ahead. It's a false victory, the terrorists have an upper hand. It's subjective. Depends on how you see it! Guys, alert. Hamid online. My second demand: Release Rehman Gul. You have our leader and we have yours. It's the perfect exchange offer. I know how slow your government officials are. Therefore, I am giving you an hour to decide. Everything is under control. There is no movement in the corridor. Up linking all CCTV feed to emergency ops war room. Stop. Stop. Sir. Live feed. I want every frame to be recorded. Yeah, keep it running. Let's plan our entry. Give me the blueprint. Okay, listen to me. Now, this is the main door. Gentlemen, what is our decision on Hamid's demand? We are about the hit the deadline. We have two options, sir. First option: Army action. I recommend this. We have the live feed. My commandos will be ready for assault in 20 minutes, sir. Can you guarantee Prime Minister's safety? Chances of the PM's survival are the same as that of the others. Then the army won't go in. How will we save our country if we cannot save our Prime Minister? I won't give the permission to attack, Until I'm assured of the PM's safety. What's the second option? Second option: Negotiation. We can offer Hamid a hefty sum to release the Prime Minister. And I would strongly recommend that. Agreed. Offer him money. That's what everyone wants Hamid is not here to rob a bank, sir. - He's a hardcore terrorist- - What other option do we have? Should we release Rehman Gul? The most viable option is right in front of you. Arjun. Please give him some time. So you want us to trust that soldier to come good? That one soldier has the strength of a battalion. And what if he fails? Then we'll do as you say. Sir. Hamid has made another demand. Let me guess, he wants Rehman Gul? Yes. I fear that the Home Minister might give in. This is the first time we are so close to Hamid. Let's crush him. Yes, I am working on that. But Home Minister is in charge, and I think this guy is madly in love with the Prime Minister. I don't think he'll let us attack until the PM is safe. So, for now, you are being ordered to just do a recce. And quickly find a way for the army to get in without setting off the bombs. On it, sir. Shit. Stop. Stop. Tripwire. Hussain? Mallik? Where's Hussain? What are you hiding? No one's coming to rescue you. Where's Hussain, Mustafa? He went after the girl. That fucking skirt chaser. Let's go. I.R.A.? Remote detonated explosive devices. 20 kg RDX bombs on all entrances. You want help? I've got you. I've got you. Alert. Message from Sabah's smart watch. "Help". What else are you hiding in there? You...! So, you think you can take me on? Sir, the library. Damn it. Oh, shit. Let me show you want I can do. It's time you feel the heat. No.. No.. Sir, see this. Hamid too is proceeding towards the library. No.. No.. Arjun, don't. Hamid's headed your way. - Don't do anything. - But, sir... It will put the whole mission at risk. You'll expose yourself as soon as you fire that gun. Arjun, put the gun down. He's coming. No. No. Arjun, I know what you are thinking. Don't go in. Don't go in. Arjun, he's coming. Don't go in. Arjun? Arjun, are you listening? It's my order. I am sorry, sir. - I can't take this anymore. - Stop him. Arjun... Arjun, please! Arjun, don't go in! Don't go in. No! Hussain? Hussain? Hussain? Hussain? There's someone in the building apart from us. Highly skilled. Heard that? Drilling? I need to go outside. Lock the door. Stay safe, stay inside. Wear this. If anyone touches you, just shoot him. Arjun? Be careful. You and I.R.A. aren't completely synced yet. Anything can happen in real-time. I.R.A. can even shut down. Don't worry, I will. Someone has hacked it, Brother. Live feed is being relayed outside. Cut it off. Go offline. Pull the plug. Sir, they cut the live feed from the Parliament. We cannot trust him. I had warned you. Sir, he will come good. You still think so? He disobeyed your direct order. But it's his moral duty to save that girl... Don't bother. I have been given the responsibility. I am in charge. Like you said. I make all the decisions henceforth. Sukrut? Oh hero! I know you are here. Switch your walkie to frequency 463.65. I think it's time we know each other a little better. You already know what I can do. You'll soon know who I am as well. What are you trying to achieve from all this? You think you can save your country by killing a couple of my men? And then what? A promotion? A medal of honor, maybe? A happier ending? Let me describe your ending to you. Your body will be lying here among the other dead bodies. And It won't even take two days for your country to forget you. You're making tall claims, kiddo. Don't bother about my ending, yours is going to be a tragic one. Why don't you show yourself if you are that confident? Why are you hiding? You sure you want that? You might wet your pants again. November 25th, 2010, remember? You are the same soldier! How wonderful! What a pleasant coincidence, Brother! I am so happy. It's not a coincidence. You owe me your life. Come on then, let's settle this. I'm already on it. Well, there's a call. Alert! Don't. Sukrut, you talk to him. Yes, sir. I told you not to do it! Didn't I? I told you not to enter the parliament! Hamid, just forget what happened. Government of India has an offer for you. We'll give you a safe passage and 10 million dollars to let the Prime Minister go. What do you think? You think you can just buy me off like that? - Are you on speakerphone? - Yes. - State your name. - Sukrut. - State your name. - Pritam Singh, MP Uttar Pradesh. P... P... Pritam Singh. You are responsible for his death. NO! Quiet! You, come here! Come on. State your name. State your name! Wait, we are ready to accept all your demands. You have no other option. But first, you have to hand that commando over to me. Else, I'll shoot the Prime Minister next. Got it? Okay, we'll take care of it. You call that a negotiation? That man is capable of doing anything. Release Rehman Gul immediately. This is wrong. I am sorry sir, but I won't take orders from a terrorist. It's my order. You don't get it, sir. This is sending a wrong signal. This will only encourage others to follow suit. We'll cross that bridge when we come to it. You are to do as I say. This will save lives. You are putting the future of our country at risk. And I will not stand by and let this happen, sir. - Then resign. - Sir? Sir! I won't change my decision. Don't forget that I am the acting Prime Minister. I won't let my country surrender under my watch. The Indian Army does not negotiate with terrorists. NG, you are in charge here. Call me when you need army action. Sir, what about that soldier? Hmm? Ask that soldier to surrender. Right away. Arjun, come in. - Sir. - My hands are tied. Surrender to Hamid immediately. So we're throwing our hands up before a terrorist now? How dare you blame us? Your shenanigan to save that girl got a minister killed. In battle, when a fellow soldier dies, we don't surrender. We keep fighting for his honor and sacrifice, sir. Handle him, Subramanium. Our soldiers have become quite high spirited these days. Listen, Arjun. Hamid can kill more people just to prove his point. We are past the deadline. And we are being forced to release Rehman Gul to stop him. Go to Hamid and end this. I repeat, just end it. Yes, sir. I know what you are thinking. Good. You won't follow the orders. I guess you didn't hear him. "Go to Hamid and end this." Exactly. That is the order. We go in and end Hamid. Okay. But what's the plan? Just read my mind. Found him! Stay there and Don't move! On your knees! On your knees now! Hands in the air! He killed Hussain! We should shoot him right away! Don't move! You killed Hussain. You're a dead man now! Initializing stimulation. 89 hostiles confirmed. High-grade weapons. Locking target. Sir. - Don't walk with pride. - We need to engage. No, I.R.A.. Let him get closer. We attack in 3, 2... Chip malfunctioning. Chip-chip-chip Malfunctioning. I.R.A., no. So I'll be wetting my pants, huh? Body resistance going down. 40% Look who they sent to rescue you. 20% India's savior! Arjun, come in. Arjun? - Arjun? - I.R.A. has shut down, sir. No signal. What? Shit. Hey, Mr. Paradise! Let's go. It's time to go back to your country. You okay, sir? May I have a word with you? Sir, they cannot control Hamid. If things go south, all the blame will fall on you. Why will they blame me? The blame always falls on the PM, sir. The job you are "acting" for is a tough one. You'll be the first one asked to resign. Let Subramanium make all the decisions henceforth. You might have to shift the blame while talking to the media. Hmm. Take my father to Rawalkotla and release him at the airport. Give him a satellite phone so that I can talk to him as he travels. We'll discuss the rest once he is out of Indian airspace. What a surprise! You okay? Come with me? We are also seeing these patterns for the first time. Arjun, come on you're dreaming. I.R.A. is like a screen saver. It will show the visuals from your past memories. A yes ha, will you marry me? Yes. Yes! My last demand. I want a safe passage to get out of here. A GAR airline flight leaves for Ecuador from IG Airport in 45 minutes. Keep it ready for us at Gate No. 47. We will leave from here in our cars. Once we leave the Indian airspace, I'll disarm the bombs via a remote detonator. Touch the doors before that and all the bombs will go BOOM! So do we have a deal? Speak up, Uncle. Okay. We have a deal. I won't call back. Us man! Khalid! Get them out of here. Keep moving! Go! Fast. Saqlain? Is it done? It is ready, Brother. What's the pass code? My birthday. What? My brave warrior! What are you doing, Brother? Father will reach Rawalkotla in 20 minutes. And we'll be at the airport. Detonator. You have the briefcase, right? Use this switch in case you need to detonate it sooner. Are you confident that no one can defuse it? 100%, Brother. There are six blasting caps and six firing circuits. No one can defuse it in less than 20 minutes. But you can? Of course, Brother. I made it, so I can defuse it. Good job. Well done. Thanks, Brother. Brother? Brother? - Mustafa. - Yes, Brother. Jihadists are treated like kings in heaven. You are going to heaven, my brother. This bomb has to explode at any cost. The army will try to get in. Make sure there's a bloodbath. We have only broken their backbone. Now it's time to kill India's spirit. God willing, soon. - Goodbye, my friend. - Goodbye, Gul. Inform General Singh that Hamid is leaving the Parliament. Let's ambush him at the airport. - But sir, under whose authority? - Mine. No more negotiations. Let's kill that bastard. Yes, sir. Get in, everyone. Quick, go. Sir. They are moving. What's wrong? You can't stay here. You want to leave me? I have already left, Arjun. I am gone. But still.. I am here only to tell you how much I love you. We have spent very little time together, but those were the most beautiful days of my life. I know you've been through a lot. But believe me, you have a beautiful future ahead of you. But now, you need to let go. You need to let go. It's synchronising. Will you do that for me, my darling? I love you. You know I love you more. A yes ha? Life will try to hold you down, but this journey must always go on. *Machine Voice* Welcome back, Arjun. Left. Right. Path is clear. NSG deployed at the airport. Grenade. 30 minutes. It's all we have. Take a detour. Clear all civilians from the airport radius. Over. Airport in sight. Army personnel on standby. Snipers in place. Bomb active. - 20:24 seconds to the blast. - What? Can we defuse it? Not possible. We don't have time. Then we need to get the hostages out of here. Survival chance is zero. This is a chemical bomb. What? Sarin gas, affective radius 30kms. - Shit-shit-shit-shit-shit! - Come in for Arjun. Sir, Arjun's comms are on. - Arjun, come in. - Where's Hamid, sir? We'll be ambushing him at the airport. We don't have that much time. He activated a chemical bomb before he left the Parliament. Sarin gas. I repeat sir, it's Sarin gas. Half of Delhi will be dead in 20 minutes. - What! - Intercept Hamid now! Intercept the car! Intercept it right now! - Where's he? - Check for Hamid Gul. We need a positive match. No one shoots! I repeat no one shoots! Don't shoot. Don't shoot. I am Nitaraj Swammy, MP. They told us to go to the airport or else they'll blow up this vest. No bombs. Hamid is not in the car, sir. - Hamid is not in the car. - Hamid is not in the car? Then where is he? - Move on! Move on! Move on! - Arjun, it was a decoy. Sir. Hamid never left the Parliament. Sir, that's impossible. Sir. Hamid is not here. He wouldn't stay here after activating the bomb... Wait, wait, wait. The drilling. I.R.A., the Parliament blueprints. Projecting. What's that? It's a tunnel, made by the Britishers. Where's the exit? No exit. The Indian government had sealed it. But looks like there has been a breach. Go, go, go! Sabah, you have 15 minutes. Get the hostages out at all cost. Quick, go. Arjun, did you get Hamid? No, sir. He set us up. They drilled a hole from the underground metro site. To the old tunnel beneath the Parliament. It must have taken them months to do it. This has been his plan all along. Negotiations, Rehman Gul, airport safe passage were nothing but delay tactics. He was buying time to plant a chemical bomb while we waited at the airport for him like fools! I.R.A., scan CCTV for Hamid. Scanning. Sir, I found him. Arjun, get him. He has a remote detonator. And that's our only hope. Copy that. Send backup. Send SOS to the Army Chief. He needs to set up a 20km perimeter in the city and initiate emergency protocol. Hurry! Stop, stop, stop. Stop. Stop. Back off, everybody. Back off. Hamid moving towards Safdarjang airport 25 kilometres away. What is this gas? It's 26 times more poisonous than cyanide. When the bomb explodes, it'll spread all across Delhi. People will die as soon as they breathe it. Evacuate the city then. We have less than 15 minutes. Mass evacuation is impossible. Emergency responders won't be able to do anything. Prime Minister? There's a bomb here. Back off. 10 minutes to blast. We need to look for an alternate route. A short cut. Re-calibrating route. Fast. Take a right. - Go. - Yes, sir. Bike engine on fire. Emergency flight request has been cleared. Airbus Argus B-12 is ready for takeoff, sir. - Airstrip is clear. - Hurry! On it, sir. Sir, someone's on the runway. - What? - Someone is there. Rascal. Go, go, go. Hurry! Take off right now. Take off! Engine on full throttle. Taking off. Now! Take off! Take off. 35 seconds to the blast. Press red switch to disengage. Remote signal lost. I.R.A.! Shit. Is that all? This wasn't the main bomb. Then what was it? Everyone, ready? Sir! The hostages are coming out. Get them into safe perimeters. Yeah, move! Ambulance, doctors, everyone. Get them there. What about the gas bomb? It has been deactivated. How? How do I stop it? Cut the red wire exactly when I say. - There are two red wires, I.R.A.. - The top one. Steady. In 3, 2, 1... cut! Deactivation sequence initiated. 100% sync. Sir, we have the Prime Minister. Well done, Arjun. I knew you could do it. Thank you, sir. What about Rehman Gul. We have taken care of that. He was fighting for his land, we offered him the sky instead. That's great. Permission to go home, sir. Permission granted, my soldier. Permission granted. Sir, shall I tweet from your account? Hmm? Yes, post it everywhere Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. Tell everyone that I saved our country. Hail Mother India! Hail Mother India! Hail Mother India! Hail Mother India! Hospital.
