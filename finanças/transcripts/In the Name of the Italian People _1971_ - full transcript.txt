"Due to proved infringement of the building code laws nr. 765 and 517..." "Manzo Odoacre, head of Tiburtense Construction, is sentenced to..." "18 months detention, a fine of 3,220,000 and trial expenses." "In addition is required that all the buildings previously listed must be demolished..." "In the described area and effective immediately." "In the name of the Italian People the sentence id executed." We are ready, sir. -Proceed. Sign here. Thanks. -Let's go. Welcome back, Dr. Bonifazi. We heard you been promoted to judge, congratulations! Thanks. Much more work... -Much more of everything. Morning, sir. Santenocito Eng. Lorenzo, president of Plast S.P.A, plastic extrusion for construction industry... Of Prati Clementini and South Pomezia construction... Of Santenocito Highways, of Lazio Mio Estate... Of Nostra holding company, of Giannutri insurance... Vice President of Hotel Society West Sicily and of Torzillo&Santenocito ceramics... Council member of Lazio clay bricks and asphalt society... Are you going to the Tor San Lorenzo camping? You're not the first one I pick up. You know why I pick you up? To tell you what I think about you all. You despise people like me but you get rides in our cars. You call us exploiters, but you exploit us. And you're doin it right, cause most tolerate you 'stead of squashing you. "Camping"? You know what I would do with your camps? I wouldn't forbid 'em... I'd surround 'em with high voltage barbed wire. And fill them with "youngs" like you, under 25 and with your heads shaved. Hard work 16 hours a day, conscientious objectors... anarchists... Maoists... all spitting blood. Like us, that fought in the war and now work hard for the country benefit. How old are you? I bet you say 26 to avoid the camp... You don't understand and you let me talk for half an hour... get off, dick head! Fascist! Son of a bitch! ...president of Clean Rome association, administrator of Cooperative Industrial Bank... Of Fondiaria Cements and Trinacria Estate... President of Tirrena Multisports... Mayor of SMIA biodegradable detergents... Only administrator of SUB stock society, counselor of Cariddi Film... President of South Central Pharmaceutics... Look at this, passing right in the curve... Let's teach him a lesson. He's Santenocito... you don't teach him no lesson... Hello, guys! We fined him 100 times, all canceled... This one's gonna pay for him too... The janitor entered the girl's room at 10 a.m. Miss... Oh God! Oh my God! After a first inspection, Dr. Brunori was summoned. He extensively examined the corpse... And stated as follows: From a first exam we can see bruises and contusions... She was beaten up. No trace of medical treatment for the wounds, though significant... The body and the sheets were set back by myself exactly as they were found... That is in perfect order, which suggests intervention of a third person. No, judge... it's not because I "suspecteded" a violent death of Miss Silvana... That I called the Carabinieri insted of Dr. Silvestri from the second floor. No? -No sir... Cause at Dr. Silvestri's they told me he was at the hospital, the hospital told me he was at the clinic... Yea yea, I got it... You can't keep track of the doctor these days... like Don Tartaglia's dog... You run after him and he runs after the quail, that's how it is. In conclusion, you hadn't "suspecteded"... That the girl might have died of non natural causes. At what time she came home the night before? I ignore that, she usually went straight through the garage. Straight through the garage... Yes... little I saw her, little I knew, she lived alone, period. Lived alone... I know where to put periods, you don't need to tell me. I was just helping. Why such a young girl lived alone? For further details about her, please address the parents... can I go now? Did the parents see her often? Very often... -Very rarely... Often or rarely? -For instance, that day we 'd invited her for dinner... She said that night she had to see an important person... we ingnore his "entity"... We hate wasting, so we invited a neighbor, widow Caciotti... Who paid homage to the supper, then, next morning... You see, Mr. Magistrate... -The janitor called us and said.... Our baby... -Even though we didn't live together... The daughterly solicitude of our baby was always unique. If you'd known her... joy itself... We called her "Lodoletta"... you see, we have serious financial straits... My wife, teacher of pick instruments, gets a very small pension... And she's also diabetic, Mr. Magistrate. And me... "no bread for the poets"... although I'm a painter... We don't care... stick to the facts, please. I'm a faithful and trusty woman! Tell it to that cuckold of my husband! Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. Reality is awful, Judge... fantasy is much better. Our baby quit studying very soon and got into the "big pot". What? Big pot? She made good money and took care of us... even mud baths this year. You just said "big pot"... What do you mean by "big pot"? In what sense? What kind of job she had? Public relations? -You're asking me? You gotta know, not me! She frequented, she received and was received... she "explicated" herself... Nice environments, nice gentlemen... -Big shots of commerce and industry... Foreigners, Italians from Milan, few from Rome... She spoke English... -Big hotels, jet society... Let's tell him about that boy... You think they really don't know what kind of job she was doing? I think they don't. There's an episode that enlightens our baby's personality... Shall I tell? -Tell me, tell me... One year, she became estranged... that's to say she fell in love. Of a young boy... -A bum! She even wanted to marry him! So she did quit her "explicating"... no more earnings, no more giving to us... See what love is capable of? This "young bum" is by any chance... Roscioni Sirio? -How do you know? I already questioned him, he plays basketball and study as radio technician. -And doesn't make a dime. Yes, yes... go on and don't digress, please. Yes... deprived of our baby's subsistence, we had some tough time... In fact one night, driven by hunger, we went to Tito's... We hoped to make some cash, cause my husband, besides painter, is also a semi-baritone. They drove us away, cause street musicians are a closed mob in which you cannot enter. Mom! Mammy! My daughter! I still can see her, Judge... Whining and crying she said: "Mom, forgive me for the troubles I caused you!" "It's over between me and Sirio... I left him." Are you moved, aren't you, Judge? So, the wretched girl left who was "plotting" to marry her and went back to the "right way". We had more good times then, I even got a new dental plate. You thought he was father of a whore without knowing... 'stead he's a son of a bitch and he damn well knows it. For the last time, tell me what kind of job you got her into! Excuse me... "got her" is not the right phrase... It is! -You fairly search concrete facts... But life is ambiguous... -That's its magic... Name some of those important "gentlemen". We weren't into that... Come on... spit it out... Who was that guy who recommended her to the Standa department stores? Yes... Engineer Santo... Santo Antonio... Yea, and St. Francis too... The guy who also owns Plast that plastic factory... Plast? -Yes, yes... Santenocito! -Yes, that's the right name! He was kind enough to write a letter of recommendation for her. It's all I need, you can go now. Yes, let's go. Good... -Just go. Morning, professor... are the results ready? Calm down, haste is a poor advisor... hi. Miss Carmen! -Yes, professor? Tell Mazzetti to get the papers about that dead girl, we got judge Bonifazi here. How are you? -Fine, thanks... and you? I'm tired. -Me too. Can you tell me something in advance? She had nice boobs... let's go check out the results. How's your constipation? -You gave me boiled prunes, some medicine... I'm against medicines, you know... I'll tell you how it goes... Constipation is often an excuse to spend hours inside the bathroom... Cause it's the place where intimity fights its battle against the social confusion outside. Man came from shit and there returns, thanks to goddamn progress! Don't you agree? Yes I do. -Who's imposing industrial civilization? Lenin and Marx? -And Donald Duck... Mazzetti! How about them results! Something for you. -What? Hunting and fishing. -This smells... Just a bit high... it's a dead bird with a dead fish inside. Has to do with this case? -Maybe not... Or maybe yes, who knows... Killed by the wastes of plastic factory Plast, stock company... bad company.... Own by Eng. Santenocito. The contractor? -Yes, he managed to build his factory with public money. And you're trying to get him for pollution... aren't you fixated? Fixated? I could have eaten that fish... -I wish... You hate progress cause it poisons citizens, but what do you do about it? I don't give a damn about citizens, they all wish to become industrialists and poison others. Haven't you judges realized yet that this Italian people deserve a big nothing? You go on and defend 'em! Some deserve... and who doesn't will be punished. You're saying we don't deserve? What you gonna do, Robespierre? Cut our heads off? For doctors just financial punishments, you'll suffer more. Bad joke... we won't laugh... right, Mazzetti? Put that chicken in the fridge. Save one leg for the professor. Here... -Let me see... You won't understand. Death is to be set between midnight and 2 a.m.... She didn't die because of the beatings, hits were violent but not deadly. How did she die then? -Let's see... Analysis of intestine and kidneys content... -"Alteration of kidney ducts"... what's that? She died from some opium derived substance. -Drugs? Why? If she was alive would you prosecute her? What did she do anyway? Well... she "explicated" herself... A whore. Well, yes... What kind of opiates? -It would take a gaschromatography... Do it, please. What about the mechanics of the death? Just one theory... She may not have died in her bed. -Someone put her there afterwards... It is possible... Good morning, Don Manzi... so? -While you wait you might wanna look at this... So, how's a going with the signatures against divorce? -Well... I'm gonna sign... sign everything. What's this? Convocation from the courthouse... It's for a testimony... What testimony? Tell 'em not to bother me... Eng. Santenocito? -Yes, thanks... I'll be right back. Write down... I'll buy the De Chirico but I want certification from the notary. Dear! Be patient... Congratulations, Procurator! Judge Bonifazi! -Here we go... I'll see you. Morning. -Morning. Have you closed the case of the junkie bitch yet? No, I haven't... I'm waiting for some more examinations. In the meantime go talk with the ex boyfriend, that young kid... Done... that night he was in Faenza with his basketball team. Came back on sunday night. -Too bad... I summoned Santenocito twice, but he didn't show up yet. -Santenocito? Yes, him... apparently he knew the girl. If he doesn't show up today I'll send the Carabinieri to pick him up. -Wait, now... Don't you stew anymore? -Stew? You're always stewing... "come on", "close it"... suddenly you're not in a hurry anymore? What hurry? I was just advising you in a friendly way... No friendly advice, please... just wait til I'm done. You can't reject my respectful collaboration! Respectful what? You're always pushing... I know you have it in for me, you wanna drag me into some specious polemic! And I have no intention of letting you do it! I don't do "specious polemics". What is this fervor then, judge Bonifazi? Don't call me fanatic, you asked for recidivism for the theft of 2 pounds of apricots! So it's this... -You have the excessive fervor of a man of very little moral independence! You suffer from legislative walleye! -I won't allow such demagogic aggression... You take back everything you said, right now! If I'm a demagogue, what are you then? You take back! -And you answer! And cure your nerves! -You cure yours! If I'm a demagogue, what are you? A fascist? Answer me! And avoid approaching me in the hallways with that tone! I know my duties! I don't need you to teach 'em to me! I'm a magistrate! Me too! -I also am a magistrate! Luckily there were no casualties. The building has been declared not usable and it's been evacuated and closed. I believe it crumbled under the weight of too many overdue lawsuits. What do you think about this accident? I only know that these things didn't happen in the old days. Like the ragman divides rags from paper, so we do with these ragged papers... Judicial hearings are temporarily suspended. Emergency locations are being opened for judiciary offices in trial courts, schools and barracks. You follow and help out... No! Never three in a row! This is an abuse! Drive me home, I can't show up like this! I tried to reach you all day, I have orders to take you to the investigating judge right away! Sorry... Aren't we going to the courthouse? Where are you taking me? -We're almost there... Somebody's gonna pay for this, drag me around dressed in a costume... It's a disgrace! I might as well put on the helmet too. I hope there's photographers too... nice impression we'll make! Where are we? Guards out! Tanks? What happened here... a "golpe"? -What? A military takeover? -No... the TV talked about it, we're here temporarily. This way. Some are always playing, some always working... This way. (RECITES "LO SPECCHIO DER GOVERNO" BY GIOACCHINO BELLI) Gioachino Belli never gets old... "Authoritarianistical" abuses in a "totalitaristically" ruled country are "deplorationable"... "Prevaricationism" indicating the highest grade of "repressivity"... Is the one availing of the highest concession of collective designation... Dear sir! I only get "dear sir"... Let me translate in vulgar... The worst kind of abuse takes advantage of the power given by community. You get it, now? Listen... That's "The Silence"... so lower your tone and sit down. You are Santenocito Lorenzo, born in Trapani on November 28th, 1923... Profession, entrepreneur... working mainly in Rome... The more they stink, the more they strut... I could squash you like a fly... One phone call and you're off to Pantelleria... Or better yet... Filicudi. Fiscal residence, Ardea of course. Look. Who is this? So you don't know her... It's a girl who died in mysterious circumstances, it was in the papers. No. Still in 1969 you recommended this girl for a job in Standa. Judge... your vision about my economic operator activity is twisted. I move at a "verticistical" level. A businessman who maintain relationship with anyone who got a recommendation from him... Might as well maintain it with the end-user of the finished product. With who?? The end-user of the finished product... that's the consumer. Why don't you just say "consumer"? Gosh! Because I reject the dullness of undifferentiated terminology. More words, more ideas. I like the language "cohesional" and de-simplified. Tell me... what would you say besides "de-simplified"? De-simplified? Complicated... Complicated? Yes, complicated. Yes... ok... anyone can say that... Your name is Lorenzo, has anyone ever called you just Renzo? I couldn't prevent that, why? Cause in the dead girl's notebook there's a Renzo, with his phone number... 3912793. It's not mine. -We already know that... It's the Rowers Club, of which you are member. Renzo... do you think is such an unusual name? You know how many Renzos are rowers? Yes, if they're not named Renzo they're not accepted... We're both comedians, aren't we? Humor comes from freedom, if one is missing, the other's missing too. Is that linked to our case? Yes it is... The exercise of justice in a repressive environment such as barracks is a disturbance of the freedom of the witness. Here, you're my superior and I am the subordinate. We're here cause the courthouse, built by dishonest contractors and obliging politicians, Was falling on our heads. Why are you using that tone, judge? Maybe cause I'm a contractor too? Is that a crime? Will you arrest me for that? Are we in Russia? Or China? Or maybe is because I'm Sicilian... Of course not, you only here to answer my questions. I did answer, but I still don't know what you really want from me. Where were you the night between May 7th and 8th? -Why that exact night? Cause it's the night the girl died. You're asking me for an alibi then, finally... Of course... In Italy is mandatory for the citizens to always carry around a standard alibi... And show it at any request of the authority. Can I ask you a question? -No! I do that! Who's always carrying an alibi? Criminals! That's why I don't have it! You don't... -No! I don't have it! Should I remember what I did 10 days ago? I do a million things everyday... Ten days ago I may have been in Berlin! I often go to Berlin! And Munich too! Keep your voice down! -I can't remember it all... We're not in Caracalla hot baths! At night, exhausted from work, I stay with my family! Is that an alibi? No! Family can only witness against you! -I'll decide that! I stay home! With my wife and my dad, who by the way is very sick! What's left for someone like me? Hated and victimized as businessman... While being in fact a proletarian... Mr. Santenocito, just answer my questions... ...when all is gonna be in the hands of bureaucrats and politicians, what will be left for me... Besides the family! Which I love! I just remembered... That night I played "Scopetta" with my dad... Not Poker or Bridge... the very Italian Scopetta, is that clear? I'll see you. -Where are you going? -Out. Have I told you to leave? What makes you think we're done? You'll leave when I tell you to. You can go now. Engineer... your helmet. You had calls from MP Menchelli, senator Lagona, attorney Badalamenti... And from the Hilton, Mr. Blo... -Bloomfield! Who else? Names! Names! MP Coppò, or Coppolò... Mr. Piglialongo... Then? -Attorney Balzani, senator Spanò... Dr. Trapani, countess Gori, general Merechinò... Mrs. Caruso, MP Ricci... What did they want from me? -To know what happened... Nothing happened, just a testimony... Nothing! Lorenzo... "Lorenzo..." What else you got for me tonight, Lord? Bad news. "Bad news"... With your vocation to bad news every night you really disintegrated my "spheres"... Spit it out. Your father, who is closed in his room cause that witch Greta took a day off, broke the dresser mirror... the poor old man. I saw you making the "horns" gesture... The great Santenocito is superstitious... He's afraid of death, of hunger, of revolution... So he gets off the bed with the right foot and scratches the balls of a statue. -Shut your mouth... This zeal about your father-in-law is just snobbery... You wanna look like an unusual housewife, while you're just a squirt with a vocation for extravagance. Mean people confuse love for others with extravagance. Nice... where have you read it? Where have you been? In court... in a barrack actually, for a nonsense. Make up a better lie... you're a pig and a pimp... Yes, a pimp... in fact I married you. You married me for another reason! To get support for your business in old war junk... those English trucks... Mom was right, she wanted to report you to marshal Montgomery. Talk, talk... -Coward! Menopause! What infamies are committed in your name! Laugh, Lavinia! Unload your neurosis! But don't pull me into your hysteria... tonight I'm in a great mood! I bet I can spoil it... -I bet you can't. I think I will. -I think you won't. Your daughter is pregnant. -What the... See, jerk? Giugi! Let's give freedom to kids! Giugi! What? Mom told me... are you pregnant? Tell me you're not! You're boring... I told her just for joke. Nice joke... she took it seriously. She can't tell what from what. Giugi... today a 18 yrs old virgin is an exception... But this world, so wicked as it is, does not need exceptions? Only clean consciences can save it. Keep yourself pure, don't throw yourself away... men are wolves... Sorry, but... tonight daddy is a bit down... Then pull yourself up cause you're squashing me. Rascal... I know you... you do love me but you don't admire me... is that right? No.. I do admire you... Then tell me... "Dad, I admire you for this, this and this..." -"Dad, I admire you for this, this and this..." Right... Stay pure... And most important, let's always stick together like this. Hello? -It's me again... I got a notion... What if behind this raving judge there's a scheme orchestrated by Lercari? Scheme? What makes you think that? Cause I refused to finance his party. I could talk to the minister myself, but you better say something as my lawyer. If it's the consequence of a scheme... You're not making sense. Sometimes I wonder how you made such money with such a crazy head. You really think a magistrate would play that kind of game? Some recent cases are just exceptions, they're not your peers. Alright... I can relax then. Of course... you have nothing to do with it, right? I swore on my daughter. -Yes, yes... I think it's gonna end up soon. You didn't tell me the name of this judge. Bonifazi. I cannot relax anymore? Not that much... I'll tell you this... In just one day he issued 39 arrest warrants for abuses in the juvenile institutes. He's a tough one... have you spoke to your father? I'm going right away. Call me back tomorrow morning. Good evening, Miss. -Good evening. Have you put him to bed already? -Yes, but I don't think he's asleep yet. Daddy, how are you? Bad! -Why? Cause you came visit me. -You're rude... I'm rude because you never come visit me. You're right, but I'm always so busy... Hush! Listen! Come... listen to this. Do you hear that? It's a violin. It only plays with the full moon. I see... come, dad... It comes from the beech woods, near the agricultural school... Of course... -Who might that be? Have a seat, dad. -Maybe some lunatic... Let's play cards. -Or maybe some desperate... Cut... Scopetta? -Yes, like that night... Like Saturday 7th, when we played all night... remember? That Saturday when Lavinia and Giugi went to Ischia! -That's right... Actually we didn't play that late... I think we finished around 10 and you went out... Play, dad.... good, you scored one point. What point? I can't take a 5 and a 6 with an ace... I played the ace, you the 6... you scored 1. What the hell are you saying? -You're mistaking... I never went out that night, I stayed here, playing with you. My son... why are you trying to make me say you stayed here that night? Maybe because of your wife? You don't want her to know you went out to meet some whore maybe... -No... Be honest... -It's just a mnemonic exercise prescribed by the doctor. To remember what happened a certain day at a certain hour. Got it? I got it, but to prove I don't need any "mnemonic exercise"... I say you're holding a 6 of "cups" and a 2 of 2suns"... right? See? You're already better. Say, dad... maybe it's just my impression, but... You seem a bit cranky... what's wrong? Of course I'm cranky, I'm always locked here alone like a dog. Let's do a thing... Let's go for that trip we talked about many years ago. We escape... you and me. What a great idea, my son! We leave right now! We'll take a pick-up truck... With a tent, a flashlight and burner... And a hunting rifle too... you and me, like when you were a kid. I'll finally get out of here... I'm not sick anymore, I'm alert, I have good memory... We'll see endless forests, rivers wide as the sea... We'll take the steamboat... -Let me talk, dad... What? -Listen good... There's a... A magistrate harassing me, about something I didn't do... If it turns out that the night of Saturday 7th I was here, nothing happens... Otherwise the judge won't let me leave... goodbye Africa... Son... I cannot tell lies to a judge... It's not even a lie! Maybe it won't be necessary... But if he asks you, you gotta say the truth... that is, I was with you that night. Is that clear? -It is! You want me to commit perjury again! I won't talk to no judge! Last time you almost got me arrested! But you wouldn't care! That's why you talk about the trip to Africa! You're a crook! I should have known! But I will tell the truth! You went out that Saturday! What truth? You're senile! You're demented! You're mad! You hear violins... I told you I can hear it, but I don't! It's not true! -It's in your head the violin! It's not true! What trip... I'll have you locked up! Let's see who is more stubborn! There was a violin! -Idiot! Fool! There was! Butter cappellini, a piece of Parmigiano, a quarter of red and a half water. And two gratin sardines while I wait. Just two and without garlic. There's garlic. -It does? Bring 'em anyway. No prunes? -No... I'm waiting for a phone call... can you tell Maria Teresa to cut it out? The judge is waiting for a phone call... -Just one more minute. Innocenti Mini Minor, the youngest thing on 4 wheels. Mini Minor MK3 Crushproof pacifier Chicco, doesn't irritate and never loses its shape... Even after months. -Chicco takes care of everything. Sorry, I'm late... may I? -Please. You can leave the bag there. This traffic is a disaster... you look good. Boy... a coffee, please... thanks. Is this where you use to eat? Nice place... it's got something... Talk to me, accountant Cerione. Your honor... Irma isn't happy anymore. I feel she doesn't love me anymore. You asked to see me to tell me that? You're still resentful after all these years... I'm sorry about that. A bit of grappa... -Yes. Don't talk about resentment, when I left Irma I only felt despise. Fair enough. What do you want from me then? A bit more... don't be afraid. Your honor, I'm here to make a righteous request... Your wife still loves you... Still wants to be addressed as Mrs. Bonifazi... Why don't you two come back together? Don't get me wrong, I love her... but it's for your happiness. Take her back, Dr. Mariano... "Amor omnia vincit". Listen... talking about love at our age is a bit gross... Did she send you? For God's sake! She doesn't know anything. I've read her horoscope... it said that she's gonna return to an old path... So you want me to take her back... I'll kick your ass right here...... Wait... what about a payment? Money to take her back? -No, for me to keep her... Don't answer now, think about it 24 hours... I'm not here to blackmail you... Last month she had gall-bladder surgery... she costs me a lot of money, you know... Dr. Bonifazi, a call for you! -Just go away! Go to hell... Hello? Yes it's me, put me through. Hello? Hello! Bonifazi! Yes, hello! Turn it down... Good morning, professor... tell me. We have the results of the exams. -Any good news? You'll see for yourself, I'm not discussing pharmacology with an ignorant like you. We found in the girl's kidneys and liver... Traces of a synthetic alkaloid similar to heroin. Which can be found in a German medicine not sold in Italy. German medicine? -Yes. Ruhenol. Write it down... -Yes yes...a pen... Ruhenol, with an H... -Say it again... Ru-he-nol... -Ruhenol. Got it? -Yes I got it. What else? -Nothing. Was this the good news? What did you expect? Name and address of the murderer? Alright... thanks, professor... see you. I often go to Berlin and Munich, so what? I often go to Berlin and Munich, so what? I don't know why they made put on the good suit. Lorenzo! Come in, dad. Miss... -Yes? Dad, you know these friends... Mr... Miss... Dad is always complaining that we keep him inside... Why don't you go take some fresh air? At Monte Mario maybe. We lived in Monte Mario for many years. Santa Reparata Street... dad used to love it. Right, dad? Santa Reparata... a lovely street... What a coincidence... we're going right that way... we can take you if you like. We're in the country, near the sea... why should I go to Monte Mario for fresh air? Lorenzo... who are these people? There's the nuthouse in Monte Mario! That's where you're taking me! I'm not crazy! Come on! Move! Don't lock me up! I'm not crazy! I won't go to the nuthouse! I'd rather kill myself! What's happening? Lorenzo! Mr. Riziero! Don't be a baby! They're gonna help you there! I won't go there! I don't wanna! Be good, grandpa...it's not a hospital... it's a nice place... I'm not crazy! Get him! Lavinia! Help me! Lorenzo! Lorenzooo! What you're looking at? I can't see pity nor remorse in your eyes. Pity and power don't get along. Nice phrase... I'll keep it in mind. Lorenzo! Why are you locking him up? Tell me why! -Go away... I'm crying. Did he bother you that much? You're a shit! Would you prefer me in jail or him in a nuthouse? Goodbye, doctor. You can go, I'll take a taxi back. Good morning, I'd like to talk to Eng. Santenocito's father. I'm judge Bonifazi. Mr. Riziero is... is... Sorry... make yourself at home... Morning... Excuse me... why still standing? I'm Lavinia Santenocito. You wanna talk to... have a seat, please. No, thanks. -You wanted to see my father-in-law. Just a few minutes ago... terrible... another crisis... They took him away with an ambulance. -It was him... What kind of crisis? The age, poor man... senile confusion. How fragile we are... aren't we? We been considering it for a while, but we postponed... you know, we love him... Why did you want to see him? Can I at least talk to your husband? No, my husband went to town. He didn't wanna see... It was a heartbreaking scene... Would you like a drink, judge? -No, thanks. Maybe just a Ruhenol pill. Pardòn? Ruhenol It's a painkiller, good for my headache. I got it too... it's the weather changing. What's it called again? -Ruhenol... a German specialty. Does your husband often go to Germany? Yes, but what's got to do with it? I can give you something else... No, thanks... it's getting late, I better leave... goodbye. Lorenzo? What you're doing here? Sorry about the curves... this way we'll get to Rome much faster. I already thanked you. It is true that in the most dreadful times, random and trivial thoughts come to mind. Like a man about to be hanged may notice the executioner's golden tooth. I happen to think that a small and funny word... May be the symbol of something more great and noble. God? Dad. That's also why I'm glad to give you a ride. There's a big void at home today. No point for me to go back home. Especially because you just got out. I don't get it. I don't get why you first pretend you're not home, and then you pick me up pretending you're coming from Rome. I'll be honest... You have no other choice. I decided to talk to you, that's why I stopped. And I decided to listen, that's why I got up. "Showdown" then. I don't know that drug, that Runol...Ruinil... -Ruhenol. Ruhenol.... And like I already told you, I don't know that girl. Dr. Bonifazi... do you really think I am a murderer? Look at me, come on... I look at you, but you look out for that truck. I'll tell you how it all happened in my opinion. Some punk drugs and beats up the girl... For some filthy reason. Which we'll eventually figure out. Realizing she was very sick, the scum got scared and took her home. The bruise on the forehead might have been caused by the door or something similar... If he had called a doctor, he surely could have saved her. But he was too afraid of a scandal. So he left her to die in her bed. And in this criminal you're seeing me! No... don't put words in my mouth. But you came looking for my father to check out my alibi... I am very concerned, that's why I wanted to talk to you. The press is always lurking... A scandal could indeed break out. Involving people above suspicion. People connected to me by work or friendship. Authorities from the Capital... Members of Parliament... Undersecretaries... Or even higher... I also wanna talk to you due to a more subtle necessity... For a need to... To lean on. Who to? -To you. To someone with a steady moral position. Even though hostile to me. I only deal with people who want something from me. Or you from them... Right... See how caustic you are? Always ready and confident. Me, on the other hand... I'm sinking instead... Doesn't matter where's the leak in my boat... The suspects, the threat of a scandal... Conjugal unhappiness. "Santenocito Enterprise S.p.A." "Earthly Paradise"... what's that? In this desolate but beautiful land... We'll grow centenarian trees. To replace the burned ones.... Well... "spontaneous combustion". Cottages... Single-family... Schools, malls, day cares, cow farms... Fresh milk... all near the sea front. At extremely convenient prices. You've got family? -No. It doesn't matter... we also have solutions for singles. Very flexible installments... no problem whatsoever. Almost for free. Nice kids... I often pick 'em up. I'm all for the young. They're the future, we're the past... what do you think? I just wanna get there within the day. It's almost 2 o'clock. Here they make a delicious "trippa"... with mint and pecorino cheese. God save us... -Then further on... "Zia Adele" for a soup. I'm not interested in this soup. Not the fish soup from Lazio... the real soup from the Marches. A short break... Best trippa I had in months. I'm glad to see you're not using your "cohesional" language. That is occasional, I admit it. No way! -No no... Thank you then. -Don't thank me... we're splitting. 5,000. -Robbery... Yes... A peaceful place... In a world that's peaceful no more. Dear Dr. Bonifazi... You know sometimes I think of giving up everything and become poor... I'd have friends... the poor talk to each other. It's not that hard. You just get up from bed without the obsession of making one more billion... With whom you push uphill the giant machine you have created. The machine would recoil and destroy me. And with me, all those who depend on my initiatives. Unfortunately, we are irreplaceable in society. In this society... The more I talk to you, the more I feel I'm losing ground. Don't talk then. I can't, I'm a talker... talking is my drug... I'm aware of that... I gotta talk to feel alive... If I shut up, I die of fear. Look at this mess... Yes, I'm afraid of death... I'm not ashamed. Life is too short. -That's why it should be lived a little more seriously. No doubt about that. Do you remember the sea back when we were kids? When vacations were an adventure... When we loved rhymes and stories... Small and simple truths about existence... then what happened? We're left alone.. We spent vacations between Anzio and Nettuno. A big hotel, which now is just... thanks... is just ruins inhabited by owls. I remember the veranda under the stars... the jazz band... Smell of fried fish... Mixed with the nice ladies in satin... We went to Cesenatico. My father was always dressed in white. And I had a Jackie Coogan fringe. I'd put sand in my swimming suit to get a bulge. And my mother used to give me an egg-yolk after bath. -To me a peach. It's strange... Man is the only animal in constant psychological development. Still there are obscure barriers, because of which, as adults... They just can't meet halfway. So true! Let's tear down these barriers then! Let's prove this infamous incompatibility theory wrong... let's talk... Think back of Cesenatico... what year was that? From 1930 to... I was there too! In 1933! Which baths? Rustichelli, near the Politeama. -Us too! Of course! Then you must be Marianino... or Marianuccio... Marianino, of course! With the Coogan hairdo. That's why I feel this need to talk to you. I did recognize you without knowing it. We played together, remember? They called me "pizzangrillo" cause I was so skinny... -I was kinda fat instead. I remember... Once I'd built a big kite and you broke it. -Yes! White, red and green! Another time you stole my bread and mortadella. -Yes... Pizzangrillo... Yes, well... in those days I was kind of a... Punk? Well, punk... -And you're still one. Cause in 1933 I wasn't in Cesenatico! Cause Rustichelli doesn't exist! And I never built a kite! There isn't one single truth in all you just said. And you tried to bribe me! -Not true! You offered me a cottage! -What? You're very wrong... Why do you think I became judge? To get rich? To have a cottage? You forgot about your past trials, in '63 and '67... For gunrunning.. -I was absolved! For lack of proves... And then you tried to steal your partner's business and he committed suicide. He was proven a paranoid! You provided the certificate. Not only you looked into my past but you invited me to lunch just to frame me! That was low! You just set a trap for me! You set it for me! -No! You knew I would ask about that Ruhenol... You're much smarter than me! -Maybe... Now you listen to what I have to say! I'm sick of defending laws that only protect your filthy society! That let people like you live prosper! People like me? What am I... tell me! You're an honest citizen, of course... you don't burn forests, you pay taxes, you don't bring money abroad... You respect the environment, you don't pollute air and rivers, you don't bribe and you brake in front of black cats! Judge! This judge has decided that when a law lets some powerful people harm the collectivity, it needs to be changed! That's exactly what I'm saying! Don't touch me! Parachutist! You're a vile man and a coward! -Yes I am a coward! Because you frighten me! Cause since the first time I saw a frightening word in your eyes... "Ideology"! You hate me on an ideological level! You are prejudiced against me! You're not a good judge! To Doris Darryll, for her extraordinary appearance in the movie "The fiery eyes owl"... The Golden Clam 1971, brava! I'm very happy to have a "Golden Clam"... I wanna become much better and much bigger... Congratulations, Doris... I'm so happy for you... I'm no producer, no cinema.. I'm into oil... Let's get some pictures. -Excuse me... Here... it's not the right day but since you're here... You said they're important guests from Kuwait... I would go for a Nordic style, the caftan people always love it. Take a look... Carla... very charming... Teacher Training College... Or Marisa, very classy too... or someone like Doris... She should go by the meter... We got this natural blonde... This one too... This one... no... Why not? She's the one I was looking for. But she's dead, poor girl... -That's right... Police. We found your number on the girl's book... And judge Bonifazi wants to have a talk with you, Mr. Roncherini. Of course... I'll be glad to have a talk... Roncherini has never been afraid of cops. Move that scooter! Come on! Dr. Bonifazi! -We got nothing for the press. I'm not here to ask, but to give... Why you look at me like that? We've been ordered not to mention Santenocito's name in relation with that dead girl. Arguable decision against free information, and the same happened to other journals, either private or partisan. That's what I have for you. If you wanna return the favor by giving me the name of the famous singer involved in that story with teenagers, I'd be grateful... Fuck off... I was trying to help... I didn't summon your lawyer cause you are... -I know. I'm still just a witness, I learned the procedure. But this isn't my concern. I was thinking, following our informal meeting... That I found, besides some polemic "accentuations", a certain "syntonization" about some human "tendencialisms"... But I must admit, you never really know a man... -That's right. And do you "really" know this Roncherini Floriano? You keep me waiting 1 hour and 47 to ask me... -Do you know him? Yes... He's a good "public relations man"... Well, not really a man actually... We often use him for promotional operations, conferences, parties, dinners, and so on... Is this for a promotional operation? -What's this? The copy of a 300,000 lire check... yours... Signed by you, addressed to Roncherini and then endorsed to Silvana Lazzorini. So? -Three days before she died. So? So, under interrogation, Roncherini said: Yes... Eng. Santenocito knew very well Silvana Lazzorini. What you mean by "very well"? The same thing you are meaning... to know in "biblical way".... May I ask why you always denied to know Lazzorini Silvana? Because, because.... It ain't easy to "explicate" the reasons... You can be accused of perjury. Judge, come on... let's speak clear... I denied, it's true... but you knew... And I knew you knew why... We're Italians... Your theory about psychological barriers... -Let it go... Doesn't really apply to Italians. We're always "accomplicized".... it may take only a wink... And it's with a metaphorical wink of an eye that I'm asking you... Is it so immoral that a man in my position wishes not to externalize his relations with a little whore? You're talking about a dead girl and I don't accept winks... got it? Sorry... I want to add that with that poor girl... I only had one sporadic encounter, so... Only? No. I was just about to add something that... may I? Something that Roncherini didn't tell you. What? Tell me... Instead I'm sure that faggot told you... so I'm telling you myself. I'll make it short and clear... in business you can accomplish more in one dinner than in 10 meetings. Good humor and good company. In these cases, pretty girls become important... especially if they're also easy... Let's make it even shorter... It is custom, during certain dinners, to introduce pretty girls to important business men? Answer yes or no. Yes. Making that man believe he's actually seduced that girl? Yes. So, due to his vanity, or maybe his sense of guilt, he becomes more accommodating in discussing business. Yes. Cause if you accomplish more in a dinner room, you accomplish even more in a bedroom. Should I say yes or no? You often brought the deceased Lazzorini to such dinners? This of course it's a crime, cause I know what you think... You don't know what I think! You just answer, yes or no! Yes. It's false, your honor... I was passing by when my motorcycle unexpectedly broke down... It was destiny, I saw an open window and I jumped in... Is it true that one time, an american business man was made believe that... A certain girl was the daughter of another business man... Who had a deal to close with him? No... I don't know anything about that. There are two articles in the penal code, 531 and 536... Instigation to prostitution? No, please... You know them. There's no instigation, they do what they do because society is what it is... as you know well. And i didn't make society what it is. They do it cause they're paid to! It wasn't a payment, it was a gift. They sell themselves cause it's the shorter way. I found her a job in Standa, why didn't she stay there? To your knowledge, did she use drugs? -Here we go again... No. I don't know anything about that. And I assure you that is pure coincidence the "cementification" of... What? What? Alright, write "evidence against me"... And I reject your tendency to put me in the defendant chair! You keep insisting on this... You wouldn't even be in that chair if you could prove where were you the night between May 7th and 8th. Again? Besides your father testimony, you have no alibi... I only have your word. Isn't that enough? -In case of trial, it isn't. I'm warning you. -Trial? I didn't talk about "alibi", you didn't record it but... I just said I seemed to recall I spent that night with my father... I didn't expect another interrogatory, so I haven't thought about that again. About what? About where I was that night... give me a minute to try and remember... Alright... think about it. And next time bring along your lawyer. I swear, your honor... it was fate... Evidently your fate is to go to jail. So, have all the documents sent to me and we'll see what to do in the next board meeting... greetings, etc... etc... How did it go? What did he tell you? Sit down... you can go Miss. He's pushing for the alibi... and that night I went to the girl's house. This is just crazy... we're down to nursery school. And you didn't tell me! I didn't even go upstairs! I just buzzed her from the street, around 9,30... She didn't let me in! She sounded upset and I just went away. Don't you believe me? -No. You see why I didn't tell you? Idiot... Who could ever believe that I just went to check those woods burned by the fire? Has someone... -No, nobody saw me... nobody can testify, dammit! Ok, I believe you... you said she was crying? -Yes. She may have been with someone... -What the hell do I know? Why can't it be a suicide? Back home we say... "You're like a rat when it's raining cats"... I don't pay you to hear proverbs from Casoria! He wants to destroy me! Do you understand? He found out I knew her and he's using that to nail me! You need a strong alibi... you need someone... Who? Someone in trouble... someone important... I have it! Congratulations! Tessital Silver Plaque to Giuliana Pezzico, for 50 years of activity in the textile industry. Hi. -Hi... I heard you were looking for me. Yes, congrats for the plaque. -Plaque? Tombstone you mean... "For constant activity and great openness"... in fact I'm closing down... It's gold... wanna buy it? And the bank credit? Credit? What I got left is a starving dog... They say we are a people of martyrs and sailors... looks like I'm the only martyr here... I have 200 unsold boats, sail and motor. How much do you need to catch a breath? -Half a billion, why? Do you know someone who's getting rid of half a billion? What you're dong on Saturdays? -Nothing, I'm always on my own.... They all turned their back on me and I don't wanna see nobody... Why you ask? You wanna take me to dance? I meant Saturday 7th, 15 days ago. What you're talking about? We'll talk later at your factory. I wish... it's been occupied... You come to me then, I can get you that credit from the bank. I don't get it... are you mocking me? I'm serious... but I need a favor as well. Anything! I'd give you one arm, Lorè! Rome. Delivered by deputy... ...deputy mayor Siardi, prizes from UIS Foundation... To industrialists and businessmen... Who excelled this last year. Among them, Eng Santenocito, for his various activities... And Commendator Del Tomaso. Two economic operators who always had the same goal... A major effect in production activity, increase of the country's economy... And jobs for all. "I was in my house near Lake Nemi, where Eng. Santenocito arrived with his car at about 9 p.m...." That's right! "We discussed about my activity and in particular about Santenocito's proposition..." "Of setting up a shipyard in Giannutri." You discussed for 3 hours, maybe more. Absolutely! At about 1 o'clock we got hungry... So I went in the kitchen to fix something up, which I'm good at... And while discussing that deal, I prepared some spaghetti alla pecorara... Lorè... tell the judge about those spaghetti.... That's not important... Did you cook those yourself? -Yes... alla pecorara... I mean, there was no one else in the house? No kitchen personnel? I'm a widower, I live alone... And given the late hour, I didn't consider appropriate to wake up Settimio, my butler. Plus I like to cook for friends. "At about 4 in the morning, despite my insistence, Eng. Santenocito went home." Concerned about his father's health. -Of course. To Rome. Good... You can sign here, Mr. Del Tomaso. Dr. Bonifazi, my colleague an I would like to thank you... For your usual sensibility and doctrine. We're glad everything is finally solved with mutual satisfaction. That's my pen. -Ah... sorry... I admire and appreciate an honest man, even if he fights me bitterly... I leave this office deeply "expertized"... Thank you for what you taught me and for showing me a glimpse of... I won't forget that morning on the seafront... a glimpse of a great soul. Lorenzo... Of course, I'm gonna talk to someone about you... Clerk, tell marshal Caciottelli to meet me in court records office. There's no criminal record about Del Tomaso, find me his butler. Alright. That Settimio... I wanna talk to him right away. Without letting Del Tomaso know. Without any warrant? -The butler is just a witness, after him I'm done. I wanna close the case. It was closed... you wanna reopen it... What you mean? Shouldn't we check the witness' reliability? Yes... but you really can't stand that engineer... Cut it out... find me that Settimio and bring him to my office. In the courthouse. -Yes, we're back there. Yes, back home... look.... Pay it, marshal... and be quick. You crook... these peas have been here for over a month... You know about peas... Come, women! Watch your mouth... take these 10,000 and give me the change. 10,000? I don't have it! Always large bills our Settimio... Can I talk you a minute? Even a hour, handsome... with those doe eyes... They let you grow your sideburns... I thought long hair was forbidden for you... What can I do for you? "Do and undo... we work like crazy... except the one who's always lazy..." No! That's the fifth section! Take these! Calm down... "It ain't better to execute a few harmless than to leave a scum run free and heartless?" Belli is always Belli... Look at this monkey... Pay attention to what you say and even more to what you don't say. What happened that May 7th in the house near Nemi? I can't remember... You don't remember that night, but you remember well this morning with officer Marchionne... Dear sir... I already explained... It's usually me that go chat with soldiers and firemen... How would I know he was there to arrest me? I admit I went over the line, but he got way too mad... You're not under arrest, but what you did is wrong... Bad! Bad! You're right... We'll forget about that... But you have to stop lying! -Yes... yes... May I go pee? First you tell me the truth. Was Eng. Santenocito in the house near Nemi the night of May 7th? Answer me, come on. He wasn't. And I stayed up past midnight. The Commendator went to bed before me, in fact I did prepare... -Wait... Come again... I stayed up past midnight, while he went to sleep before me. With a hot water bottle prepared by me. Eng. Santenocito didn't show up at all, I'm sure. Have you been paid by Del Tomaso to say that Santenocito was there at first? He said that Santenocito's wife is awfully jealous... I know how harmful a woman can be... The Engineer gave me a gift and pinched my cheek... he's such a good person, so humble... Can I have a glass of water? Even not mineral... -Ok... Pironti... is there some water? -Well... someone should fetch it... And that's a struggle, isn't it.... -Don't bother, it's alright... I can hold thirst, but pee... -Hold it a little longer. You talked about a gift. How much? 100,000 lire. A check? -A large bill... I tried to have it changed, but everyone was suspicious... So I asked the Commendator to break it, but he never gave it back... Alright, you can go pee now. -Thanks... But don't leave the courthouse and remember what you said cause you'll have to repeat it. Give me a cigarette. About that officer... it's all forgotten... I'm worried about my mom knowing... She's 76 yrs old but she cursed us nine times. Come in... good, marshal... About that incident with our officer... we'll dismiss that, ok? I'll convince the officer not to proceed. Bye, Bonifazi. -Bye, Colombo. Pironti, show him the bathroom and take him back, I'm gonna need him again later. Can I go? -Yes... -Thank you! Thank you! Get the warrants ready, articles 575 and 372 for perjury... And "aiding", article... wait... Here... 378. The Berlitz "Scuol" called... -What? Berliz Scuol... -Berlitz School... ok. Where the dead girl was learning English. They had a few notebooks she had left. The teacher said that... -I'll watch them later, you wait for the warrants then proceed with the arrests. Liparini, when you're done I'll have the commitment for trial ready... no lunch today, we work late. Today? -Yes, today... why? What's wrong with today? -There's the football game... Italy vs England... The biggest hotel complex in the Aprilia area... the three towers of "Cement-Sea". Passing on the sports area for a moment, we come to the pool, 30 meters from the sea. And this concession, my Swiss friends, costed a long line of zeros... But corruption is the only way to speed up burocracy... Corruption is progress, we may say... The swimming-pool, boldly projected in the sea... Apart from the structural values, will also be a natural barrier against... 24 minutes in the second half... The score is still England 1 - Italy 1... CLOSED FOR FOOTBALL GAME Italy-England "Translate from English:" "I'm tired of everything..." "Irregular verbs" "Given to mom, 100,000... buy blue sweater, shoes, purse..." "Given to dad, 50,000..." Italy scored! We're ahead! "March 11, called Sirio for the third time... useless..." "Out of sight, out of mind"... I don't know about that... "Dad will call Wednesday for the house mortgage..." "Lesson is over"... but how do you say 'It's all over'? How do you do it? "April 19th, I think of Sirio... where is he... what's he doing..." "Santenocito called, business lunch Tuesday..." "Conjugate 'to have' and 'to be'..." "To be or not to be... a whore..." "Why I do it? To live better." "Is it such a bad thing? And for who? For others." "And who are the others? Dad, mom, that American with the dental plate..." "Buy shampoo, pills and Aretha Franklin record..." "May 5th, called Santenocito... doesn't need me this week, call him back on Monday..." "Yes ,sir... always ready..." "May 8th, answer from the ad... they offer 80,000 a month... said I'll think about it..." "Given to mom 300,000 for mud baths..." "Saturday 10th, got my nerves and called Sirio... he answered and I hung up..." "Played our record 20 times... I can't take it no more... I'm lonely and tired... wish I could sleep..." "Why do I write this down? One would talk to a mother about these things..." "But maybe the mother is gone... I'm so unlucky to still have one..." "May 7th, rear-ended by a white or grey car who fled..." "Head banged on the windshield, head and knee really hurting..." "He'd better hit me much harder, so that I wouldn't have anymore thoughts..." There's contusions and bruises, someone did beat her up. She didn't die in her bed, someone took her there later. What an idiot... "Next month is my birthday but I won't be here no more..." "Last year I went to the beach with Sirio, a wonderful day..." "We were so happy..." "Sirio said he wanted to marry me..." "Translate from English:" "May 7th..." "Ruhenol." You're not a good judge! You are prejudiced against me! You wanna punish me for what I've done before! Not for this crime, of which I'm innocent! And you know it! On the contrary, your made up alibi proves your responsability in Silvana's death. You only want to destroy me! If I was different, with your same political views, you would see the proves of my innocence! If you hate this society, I hate it even more! That's why I decided to be the enemy of society! You won't break me! Watch out, judge! I'll be out tomorrow! Eng. Santenocito proved guilty of murder! I wanna be sent to an asylum! Like council member Petrucci! We're all equals in front of the law! The curse of my father has "contaminatized" me! I'm the end-user of his confusion! I'm "confusionized"! I'm "schizo-logorroic" at a "phenomenologic" level! "Phenomenologize-recepti-consum-user-level-popular...." Viva! Viva Italy! We won! We beat England! We're the best! We are drunk! Viva Boninsegna! Viva Rivera! Viva Il Duce! Viva Italy!
