It's okay... Let's try it. What are you thinking? The little girl... Everything. Come. What an idiot I am ! I wanted to do right. ''To do right.'' What a hoax! I don't understand. I wanted to give you everything, but I have nothing. We're together, that's everything. But where? Where are we? Outside it all. Still no official figures for the bomb blastin the metro an hour ago, Three corpses have been recovered so far, Here's our correspondent, Corpses... Yes, an estimate of three dead, The tunnel is dark, the air suffocating, The metro car, a mass of mangled metal, Only one word can describe the situation,: Hell,,, What's the matter? There were corpses... More corpses, and you were there! Who told you that? My poor Belle... You suffer so much. I was at the cafe with the group's leader. He'll be a good model for my novel. He knows it well... the great lie... hidden behind everything. She'd hired a detective to find you. Your lawyer's looking for you too, to settle your inheritance. I don't want anything to do with it, Augusto. What about Lucie, Miss de Boisieux... Have you had news? She's been ill. III? Your cousin, Mr. ThibauIt, is looking after her. ''Mr. ThibauIt''. Fine. Shall I tell him where you are? Never! Not on your life! Scum ! Stop, Fred! That bastard can wait. Save Lucie first. Lucie, come home with us! Let go of me! Let her go, you shits! - Keep out of it. - You want to destroy her? I don't need to account for my actions! Stay out of this. It's family business. We'll be back! We'll get Lucie out of here! Yes, Pierre! We'll haunt you ! That's her? How did you find me? I've come to live with you. I must be here. That's impossible. They think I'm mad but I'm not. Let me live near you.

I want only you. You ! I am not enough for you? Don't be afraid... She's been very ill. She'll stay with us a while. Poor thing, she imagines I'm a saint. Either you've told her our secret, or... No! The secret's still a secret. Then she's mad! And you, Pierre? You're my sister... whom I adore. Yes, Pierre. No, keep it. You need it to write. You're very ill. Lucie, you'll die if you stay here with us. No, I'm alive here. This fever's nothing. I have it every winter. I've sent three chapters of my new book to a publisher, under a pen-name. If I get an advance, we'll move away. When I'm better, I'll give lessons in the city. That will bring in a little. Do you want a hot drink, Lucie? No, thank you. I'II try to sleep a while. I want to work too. I can find money for us. Still no mail for me? No, nothing. Are you sure? For Mr. Roc. Maybe your father put it aside. No, we always put it there. No, Pierre. But I may be able to solve your problem. You know how the mystery that we created around you and the name Aladin has helped the book's sales... Let's stick to our agreement. After shadows and secrecy: exposure, full light. That's her. Go back now. You don't have to do it. Yes, I do. Don't go... He's doing it for you, Lucie. Everything will be fine.

I'm Pierre's cousin. I was waiting for you to come round. I'd like to talk to you. We haven't seen you lately. This came a few days ago.
