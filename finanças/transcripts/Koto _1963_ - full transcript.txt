( Kyoto style traditional narrow houses. ) in the 'Teppo' and 'Dondoin' revolts before the Meiji revolution. ( Uprisings that caused large fires. ) Therefore... even though there are many traditional Kyoto long-houses here... they are in fact no more than a century old. The Kyoto kimono shop of Sadatakijiro didn't excape the fires either. Only the earthen walled storage shed survived unscathed. They blossomed this year too. A violet blooming above... one blooming below... have they ever met? Are they aware, each of the other? Here is this year's new design. Don't you have something more alive, so brighter it jumps out at you! That's just it. We don't do that sort of thing. These days... the woman living in these "long houses"... do like this... like this... Exactly so!! Can't you keep them quiet? - Yes. It's an Osaka customer. Let them buy elsewhere. There's lots of other wholesalers. They're old customers. 'Kimono' cloth is judged by sight... ( Traditional robe. ) A purchaser can tell at a glance. No need for babble. Although much of our stuff is cheap. What are you saying? You shouldn't take it out on him. That's all. Carry on. - Yes. My goodness...! Father... The persian cloth hanging here... how many 'obis' could you make from it? ( A kimono's waist sash. ) It's too good to use for bags... and too big to cut for tea wrappers. Here you go... this'll make an 'obi' for you. Oh no, father... - It's fine, it's fine. If you... wear an 'obi' from this Persian print... it might give me... new design ideas for something original. Let's be bold, try something classic. Father... why don't you work somewhere quieter. Why not rent a small room at a temple? No need to hide away at a temple. When the shop master has to create new designs... the business is surely failing. Miss... a call for you... Mr. Mizuki. Oh... thank you. Hello. Shinichi-san... Wanna go see the blooms at Heyan shrine now. Right now? - Ya. The weather could change by tomorrow. I'll wait for you under the tree in the garden. Even alone, I never tire of looking at those blossoms. Then why don't you go see them by yourself? Still... one evening shower... don't cry to me, if they're gone. Fallen blossoms still have a charm. What's charming about flowers muddied in the rain? They're fallen, you know. You're being difficult. Who is?? OTEMON ( OTE GATE ) The Heyan Shrine was built in Meiji 28 ( 1895 ) for the Kamu Emporer who had made his capital here a thousand years before. Thus the main building is not so old. However, Ishin gate and the front shrine... are copied from Ote gate and the Daimoku Hall in the old capital. Ukon's wild oranges and Sakon's cherry trees bloom here. Chieko-san... Sleeping like this, looks so unseemly. People will stare at you. I wasn't sleeping. I knew when you came. You're terrible! Were you just pretending? I was thinking what a lucky young lady this is. Me...? I look lucky. Chieko... Chieko... Masako. I need your help for a bit. I'm all worn out. I'm supposed to help the Tea Master. This kimono would only do for bringing water. For bringing water's fine... it's only serving. I'm with someone. Fiance? - No. Boyfriend? - Uh uh. A Tea Ceremony friend. Isn't she beautiful. A rather ordinary beauty. She might hear you. I wanted to carry you across here on my back. Those who saw... would be impressed. The composition of these stepping stones is abstract, right? Don't all Japanese gardens use abstract designs. Like Daigo temple, and the moss on its cedar tree. Abstract, abstract... get's a bit too much. At least for me. Would you like some? What are you thinking? Well... what do you think? I'm sitting next to a lucky young lady. I'm lucky? I think I'd like to go to Kiyomizu temple. Kiyomizu temple? I wanted... to see the sunset over Kyoto from here... to see it over the skyline of the western mountains. Chieko... Sinichi... I was an abandoned child. Abandonded? - Yes. I'm an orphan. I was left by the shopfront's slat doors... orphaned. What are you saying? - Don't touch. I'm an orphan. ( Orphan = low status, bad luck. ) Is there proof you're an orphan? ( Orphan = low status, bad luck. ) The proof is... our old ochre slat doors. Those old doors are inside me. About the time I entered junior highschool... Mother called me and said... "you are not my biological daughter." "I took a lovely baby and ran off with it." Do you know... your real parents? The way my present parents love me... I no longer feel a need to know. Knowing you were an orphan... were you lonely... or sad? - No... not in the least. When I said I wanted to go to university... Father said it would only detract from taking over a traditional shop. Better to stay and observe closely. That was the only time I felt sad... a little. And Chieko... always obeys her parents? Yes... I'm very obedient. About marriage too? Yes... I expect so. Don't you have your own feelings? I have many and they trouble me, only... Only you bury them... you kill them? No... I don't kill them. You might as well be talking in riddles. I want to see this enigmatic orphan's face. It's getting too dark. How frightening it is. Father... Oh... good you've come. Studying caligraphy? - Ahh, never too late to learn. ( Still a beginner at sixty. ) Though the fluid lines of Fujiwara's brush style... can't be said to be uninteresting for design. Old age is sure a pain. My hand shakes. Couldn't you write bigger? But this is big for me. Well... come inside. It's quiet here, no? Already the bamboos are turning. ( Lit. - Already it's bamboo autumn. ) The mud wall's crumbling and losing its colour. A lot like me. Bamboo's autumn. ( When bamboo turns colour in late spring. ) The cherry blossoms along the shady path...? Fallen blossoms all around... floating on the pond too. In the fresh tree growth on the hill... a few cherry blossoms remain. Seen from a little distance while passing... it's lovely too, no? - Yes. Father... I bought you a Paul Klee catalogue. In here's Morika's boiled tofu. Like some? - Oh, thank you. I'm glad for the Morika tofu... but even more that you're here. Stay till evening... it'll relax your old man's brain. I'll make some good designs. Give me a just a few minutes. I'll make the tofu ready. Sorry to keep you waiting. - Okay. Will you have some with me? - Yes... thank you. This obi... how is it for young people? For me... I like it. Also your kimono... is plain. Chieko, you always wear my designs. You're the only one who wears them... the ones that don't sell well. I wear them because I like them. So it's fine. - Right. A young woman wearing a subtle desing... is nothing bad. Those who notice such things appreciate them. You don't have to wear only what I design. You shouldn't feel obliged. Obliged... I don't do it as an obligation. If you wear more decorative designs... people will think you've got a lover. Oh no... Those prayer beads...? Oh... those ones. I kept asking the nun here until she gave me them. Do you use them father... when you pray? In todays world... it's more like a mascot. There are times I feel like breaking them between my teeth. Aren't they dirty though. They've been handled for years, so they must be. Why say that? It attests to the faith of the nuns who've used them for generations. ADASHINO NEMBUTSU JI What's happening there? This area doesn't usually attract tourist buses. That didn't sound very good. It's more difficult than I thought. It's a question of breath. Father... I'm an orphan, aren't I? - That's completely wrong. I've told you about this all before. When your mother and I viewed the night blossoms in Gion... Gion's night cherry blossoms... - That's right. On a chair under the cherry tree... a very lovely baby lay there quietly. She smiled at us like a lovely flower. Your mother instantly picked her up and held her close. She looked directly at me... "Dear, lets take it and run away," she said. Sure, let's do it. After that it's all hazy. We were in front of the Hirano shop in Inubo... I think we caught a taxi from there. The parents likely... left the baby for just a few moments. You have been our daughter since that night. Twenty years have passed now. Was it a good thing for you... or bad... Even if it was good, I always feel guilty. Your mother feels the same. It was good. I think what you did was good. Flowers for sale... Flowers for sale... Flowers for the alter? Yes, thank you. Ah, welcome. I'm back now. - Welcome back. I'm home. Welcome back. How's father getting on? That's just it... He was studying caligraphy. Caligraphy? Mastering such a skill calms his mind. Our business... doesn't rely at all on father creating original designs. We can as easily sell designs from other workshops. But then father is... They're closing up without even waiting for closing time. Now it's a company, not like before. Have our household workers become just company employees? It's a bit early, but I've closed up. Thank you. Tonight there's a union meeting. We're going just now. You've done well. We're leaving now. Good night, madam. - Thanks you. Good night. Thank you. Mother... What? Mother, in your whole life... what was your most moving experience, would you say? That would be... when I married your father, and... then when your father and I... ran off together with the lovely baby Chieko. At the bank of the Kamo river... we took you away. At the bank of the Kamo river...? That was twenty years ago now. Yet when I remember it my heart still races. In a human being's life... we all do something terrible once or twice, no? To take someone's baby is a more serious sin than stealing money. Even worse perhaps than killing. Father and I, we have resigned ourselves to going to hell. But then what's hell? It's nothing to pay for having such a lovely daughter. Mother... tell me the truth. Abandoned at the old red ochre gate... you think it too pitiful? Both you and father... - Wrong, wrong. That's all wrong. Why do you want to believe so badly you were abandoned? Your real parents... must have cried so much they went mad. To think of it, even now I feel I should give you back... only I can't. Chieko... if you want to go to your real parents, I won't oppose you. But then again... if you did... this mother just might die. Mother... don't say such things. You are my mother... I have no other mother. I have always believed that. I know that. But that is also.... why our sin is so profound. Let's talk no more of this old story. For dinner tonight... I'll fetch something from Nishiki. That's good. Please do that. I don't want to meet my real parents... but in their case... their suffering may be much more than ours. Or they... may rest in a place near Adashino with no offspring to tend their graves. Thier gravestones... will be old now though. NISHIJIN Nishijin Weaving they say... has managed to survive for three generations. Even if the parents possessed the rare hands of great weavers... it'd be rather exceptional if their children did too. This one... I'd like you to do it. Oh... it's for an 'obi'. Very modern and bold. It's for my daughter. When your daughter saw this design... she must've been stunned by it. Actually Chieko gave me a Paul Klee catalogue. Klee...? Klee is? He's a French artist who paints modernist themes. He's honest, with a good design sense and dream elements. It makes contact with this old Japanese man's heart. Going over it again and again at the convent, this design came to me. I ruminated on it day and night for a fortnight. Is this obi's line and colour well conceived? Yes, very well conceived. Though completely original, it still holds... an elegant Japanese sensibility. It will be difficult to weave... but I'll work... with all my heart to realize it. Thank you. Oh, yes... the weaver... shouldn't be me. Hideo would be better. Though he's my eldest son... his weaving is more precise than mine. Well... I'm counting on you. - Of course. Hideo... Hideo... Mother... call Hideo for me. - Certainly. By and by, it might... just be useful for your daughter's marriage. No, no. Thank you, Sir. Master Sada... brought a new obi design. He has kindly come to ask us to weave it. Is that so? He drew it while on retreat at the Saga convent. It's not just a sale piece. It's for your daughter? Ya... - Oh. Hideo is very tired from working since morning. It's that kind of dedication that creates fine work. Here... have a look at this. Yes. You don't like it? Isn't it good? Hideo... Speak up, don't be impolite. I'm studying it. I'm not being impolite. Is it for Miss Chieko? - It is. It's no good? - Well. I didn't say not good. You're not saying it, but your eyes are! Is that so? What's this? I didn't say it wasn't interesting. Forgive me. This obi... please let me weave it. Really? Me too... please forgive me. My hand still hurts. Better let me use my hand. Weavers' hands have thick skin. Are you... going to the Saga convent today too? Yes, yes... for another fortnight. Don't go. Go back home. My house isn't conducive to work. This surprises me... it's colourful, decorative and modern. But... I studied deeply but saw no inner harmony. It has an appeal... in a silly, sickly way. The convent may be quiet... but maybe foxes and racoons tricked you. ( mischievous spirits ) What are you saying?! Your criticism is valid. You're a wise young man, I see. Thank you. I will think deeply about it and do it again. No... let me weave it as it is. Woven, the effect is different. Water colour and dyed yarn differ... - Thank you. Hideo... you want to weave this... for my daughter. You're doing it for Chieko? Alright then. Sorry... don't let me distrub you. Sada Sir... Master Sada...! Takao's maples have new leaves. They must be beautiful now. The crowds will be less than in autumn. Isn't it already too late? It's cooler than in town so I think it's still okay. I'd love to see the Kitayama cedars. It's not far from Takao. When I see Kitayama's cedars standing so straight and true... it refreshes my soul. Would you like to see the cedars? More than maples... I'd love to see Kitayama's cedars. They look hand crafted, no? I hear they're popular in 'Skia' style houses. ( Japanese minimalist style ) They're shipped to Tokyo and Kyushu too. The women in this village are very hardworking. The women work alongside the men. That's not so unusual. Farmers do much the same. As do vegetable sellers and fish mongers. For a girl like you, everything's amazing. I think I'm a working woman too. You're more that type. Yes... I don't work. It's easy to say the word 'work'. I'd like you to see these young women... and how hard they work. I suppose the trimming of the branches has already begun. What is that? To grow cedar that are straight they have to trim them. Sometimes they use ladders, but... often they jump from tree to tree like monkeys. No... how dangerous! Wait, Chieko... That girl? So similar... she's exactly like you. Really? You don't find it strange, Chieko? Look carefully. Ah the scatterbrain you. Scatterbrain or not... she has a special beauty. She may be beautiful, but... She could easily be your twin. See... scatterbrained. But it's strange. Perhaps she's a look-alike, but so alike is spooky. What's so similar? - It's her... her presence. It's hard to say what exactly, but... eyes, nose... Not that good Nakagyo family's daughter and... a village girl are the same. Don't mind, eh. Not at all. Say Chieko... let's follow her home and check her out. There's that Masako again... - The scatterbrain...? Father... is going to Mt. Kurama cancelled? - I guess so. At least once I wanted to show you... the bamboo cutting on Mt. Kurama. But not in this rain. There's always next year. Forget it for now. Close all the doors and windows. The humidity will dampen the cloth. - Right, right. Excuse me. Hi. It's just... I've finished weaving you daughter's obi. - Obi? Chieko's obi? - Yes. Please excuse my immature behaviour the other day. What... it was I who lost it for a moment. Your reproval woke me up. I should thank you. Well... come in for a minute. - Yes. Well... The design you drew in the convent at Saga... I decided to weave this obi from it. That design...? I crushed it into a ball... and chucked it in the canal outside your house. You threw it? Is that so? But after studying it, it stayed in my mind. But why then Hideo... did you take the trouble to weave... what I threw in the canal. What? What made you weave it? No inner harmony... a silly, sickly appeal... that's what you said... isn't that so? Please... forgive me. I do so many ordinary jobs... I tire... and I get all irritable. No, no. I too... get that way. Only... please see the obi. If you don't like it, you can cut it up in front of me. Okay. Chieko... Chieko... - Coming. Welcome. Please look at this, Miss. Your father's design. Father... you got the idea from the Klee catalogue, no? Ah... it's good. Father, it's a really good obi. You wove it very precisely. - Yes. Shall I spread it out here and see? - Yes. Father... what do you think? Isn't it fine? Is it really good? - Yes. Thank you, Father. It's a different pattern. It will depend on the kimono. What a fine obi! Well... if you like it, you should thank Hideo-san. Hideo-san... thank you. Chieko... In this obi... is there harmony? Inner harmony... Harmony? It would depend on the kimono and who's wearing it. Actually Chieko... when I showed Hideo this design... he said it lacked harmony. That's why I threw it in the canal. But he wove it anyway... and it's exactly as I designed it. Please forgive me. Miss... though it may be selfish of me... please hold it at your waist for us. With this kimono? - Yes. Miss... it's your father's work. It's his creation. GION FESTIVAL Chieko was a Kyoto girl... the daughter of a main street merchant... and raised in Gion's Yasaka Shrine community. So for her, the annual Gion Festival was a regular event. More than the Grand Cart Procession on July 17th... the locals enjoy the vibrant ambiance... of the Yoi-Yama street party on the 16th. What did you pray for? Were you watching me? I prayed to know my sister. You are my big sister... god brought us together. I'm an only child. I don't have a little sister. Forgive me... Forgive me Miss. I understand well. Always my big sister... since I was littlle I've longed for her. I've made a big mistake. They said I had a twin... but I don't know if she was elder. We must be look-alikes. Miss... where were you born? The merchant quarter... not far from here. I see. What was it... you asked the god for? The health and happiness... of my parents. Your father...? A long time ago... when he was trimming cedars in Kitayama... he fell while jumping between trees. That injury finished him. That's what the villagers told me. I was just a baby... so I don't remember anything. The reason I often felt to visit that village... the reason I love to see those beautiful cedars... could it be my father's spirit calling me. Your mother...? Mother too. They say that she was born... in a village much deeper in the mountains. That mother... Miss... Miss... good bye. What's your name? It's Naeko. Naeko? My name is Chieko. I won't tell anyone we met tonight... I swear. Only he knows... the god of Gion's temple. Miss... There's a lot to talk about. Please come to Kitayama someday. Now I'm working for someone... but it's a small village. Just ask for Naeko. You'll find me. Thank you. Good bye. Miss... Miss... Miss Chieko. Miss Chieko... alone? Yes. It's a fine evening. Tomorrow will be fine too. So many stars. Sorry for the other day... but the obi was good, no? Yes. Have you tried it on? Yes. - How was it? Miss... allow me this once... to design from my heart... and weave an obi just for you to mark my turning 30. Yes... thanks. That we met on this Gion festival evening... must be a sign from the god. Good bye. Oh... Miss... You'll let me do the obi... please? - Yes. I'll do it before the maples... - Good bye. Good bye. Miss Chieko... Why are you wandering all alone? - Ah Shinichi... This is my big brother. He's a PhD student. I'm Kyusuke. You look rather pale... a bit sad as well. It must be the light. And with the Gion festival crowd... rushing happily about... just one girl looking a bit sad... is that so unusual? Yes, quite. You hot...? You chilled? - No. A summer cold's nasty. Hurry home. We'll go with you. - Right brother? It's not necessary. It's nearby. If it's nearby, then we must. But... Were you with someone? No. So... let's go. You served as 'chigo'... and rode on the Naginata Chariot. ( chigo = festival page/acolyte ) How old were you? Oh well... around seven... as I remember. I think it was the year before I entered primary school. When Shinichi was small... he was timid... cute looking... pretty as a girl. So they chose him as a 'chigo'... such a silly boy. Shinichi, I followed you when you rode in the chariot procession. Did you notice? Of course... of course. We were so small. - Ya, we really were. Such a small girl following the whole way, impressed me. We can't be small anymore. What an idea? Welcome home. I'm home. - Come in. How was it? Lively this year too? Mother... I'm so late. I wasn't here to help you. Don't worry about it... Chieko... You seem pale... a little unsteady. You don't have a fever. Don't worry about us and go lie down. Thanks. You father too. It upset him so few guests came. Though there were 5 or 6 for dinner... I am... the child of this house. And that girl Naeko... was I perhaps too unkind? As the mother and father in this house... should I tell them... or should I not tell them? Sada sir... Sada sir... Good afternoon. Hot isn't it? Well... it's been a long time, eh? Where'd you go in this heat? Just nearby. I came to see the exhibition. - I see. Once again... with such a pretty girl. Where were you hiding her? - Foolish man. You know very well she's not my girl. She works in the teahouse next door. How old are you? I just started junior high. If you aren't in a rush... please visit Tenjin Shrine in Kitano... (Students pray there for good results) if she attracts you. ( Students pray there for good results. ) Why should I be drawn all the way to Tenjin? Is this girl a descent of Tenjin? - That's right. Quite right! ( Tenjin - can mean "heavenly one". ) This girl... I'm thinking to prepare her to start as a 'Maiko' in Gion. (Apprentice geisha) An only child? No. She has an elder sister. The older sister... just as beautiful? Well Sir... Please excuse Chi-chan for now. - Right. You can go now. - Thank you. Go carefully. It appears you're taken by her. You have 2 years 'til she comes up to savour the anticipation. It's so hot! I'm getting tired. I'll come to your place for a little rest. All along I expected you might. Goodness... it's been such a long time. NAKAZATO How long... have you been working here? Well let's see... two years, a little more than that. In that time how many patrons did you have. Forty-seven! Like the Ako ronin. ( 47 ronin - Chushingura ) And now...? - I'm single now. Is that true? - Yes. The third day after my debut... I was showing a guest to the toilet... and suddenly he stole a kiss. I panicked and bit down... right into his tongue! Did he bleed? - Ya... Of course... right away. He angrily demanded compensation and I began to cry. It was a big drama. But it was his action that caused it. Though now I can't even remember his name. Show me your teeth. - Teeth? You want to see them? While I was talking you saw them. A better look... open wide. - No, it's embarassing. You're being insensitive, Sir. Now I'm nervous to even open my mouth. They get chipped? Did you get them repaired? Don't you know the tongue is soft? No... Oh no! He's teasing! Careful, look what...! I'm so sorry. Father... where can he have gotten to? I feel better when he wanders around Gion... than when he hides himself away all the time in that convent. Chieko... don't feel... obliged to take over the family business. If you want to marry into another family, you can. Are you listening? What makes you ask that? I'm already 50 years old, you know... so I think about it. This business... why don't you close it? Why react that way so quickly? Do you really mean it? I really do. I'm not angry. Don't make such a face. The young who say that... or the elders who hear it... which will feel more lonely do you think. Mother... forgive me. Have you ever said that to your father? No. I've said nothing to father. I see. Try to tell your father... Tell him. Though he might seem angry... deep down he'll likely be relieved. Your father wasn't made to be a salesman... he's someone who enjoys creating things. The other night he mentioned... we could sell up and buy a small, quiet house in Nanzenji or Okazaki maybe. He could spend his time creating fabric designs for obi and kimono. He was speaking quietly but he sounded serious. It would mean having less money though. I would't mind that at all. I've been so happy living here. Miss... a guest for you. Welcome. It's just... I've finished the obi design... please have a look. Obi design...? The one I promised you at the Gion festival. At the Gion Festival? Ah... then come in. Please... They're good. I'm very pleased that you like them. Please... sit. - Yes. Then... which one should I make? Ah... I.. The flower can be worn all year. So should I make the flower design? Although both are very nice... Would a hillside of cedar and red pine be possible? A hillside of cedar and red pine? That could be difficult... I'll need to think about it. Hideo-san... I should apologize. Please... there's nothing to be sorry about. That is...the night of the festival... on the Shijo Bridge the one you promised an obi to... actually that wasn't me. It was someone else. Someone else? That is... it was my sister. She's my sister. I met her for the first time that night. I haven't even told mother or father yet. You know the Kitayama village famous for cedar. That girl's called Naeko. She works there. Since she's not the daughter of the landowner. She's had to work hard. Compared to me, she's much, much more mature. Please weave... one of your obi designs for her as well. Yes. Please weave one for her. Yes. Regarding... what you've asked... I will do my best work. But... why is she so similar to you? We're sisters. - Sisters maybe, but... When the obi's ready... can you take it to her personally at her place? Sure. I can.. Yes, please do that. Though it's quite far. Not so far... it's nearby. How happy Naeko will be! Will she accept it? I'll explain to her nicely. I see. Though there are two Chiekos... I'll weave the obis for you... my best. I'll take one to her. Thank you. But Hideo-san... they're not just my obis... please weave one as Naeko's obi. Yes. I understand. It seems to me as if... the Shijo bridge Chieko... was like your spirit double. My spirit double...? On August 16th, by burning the 'Dai' symbol... the Bon Festival welcomes returning souls. At this summer's Bon... Chieko feels a new sadness. The Gion Festival meeting with Naeko... had revealed that... her birth parents had passed away some years before. Miss... you're very welcome. Really you're very welcome. The cedar smell is so nice. It's my first time on the mountain in a cedar forest. All the cedar here were planted by men. These ones are about 40 years old. Most of them will be cut and made into pillars. Left alone they'd live a thousand years and grow very big. People here harvest them like cutting flowers. If there were no people in this world the city of Kyoto wouldn't exist. And this area... would be home to deer and wild boar, no? It's quite scarry the impact of people. Naeko-san... is this how you see things? Yes... sometimes. Naeko-san... don't you like people? I like people very much, only... if there were no people in this world... what would it be like. I fell asleep on the mountain once... afterward I began thinking that way. A shower's coming! Come on. Ah... I'm afraid! Bend down. Make yourself small. The lightning will strike! If it does... it won't hit us. That won't happen. Thank you. You're... going to get soaked. These are my work clothes. I could care less. I'm... I'm happy. That shining in your belt... What is it? Ah... I forgot it. It's my scraper. I was scraping cedar bark when I saw you. It's my scraper. It's dangerous. I'll pick it up on my way back. Though I don't want to go back. Even in our mother's belly... Naeko-san... you held me like this. I'm sure... we pushed... and kicked each other. We must have. I'm sure we did. You're soaked. Don't you feel cold. I'm used to it. It doesn't bother me. Rather, you being here makes me so happy... I feel all warm inside. When father... fell trimming cedar... was it near here? I can't say. I was a baby. Where was our mother born? Why do you ask me that? It's of no consequence to you. I'm glad if you think of me as your only blood family. At the Gion Festival... I may have said too much. Uh uh. I was glad. Me too. But still... I won't come... to your shop okay? I'll manage. You can come. I'll speak to Mother and Father. Don't do that! If you're ever in need like just now... I'd risk my life to help you. Only please understand. Naeko-san... that night at the Festival... when he thought you were me, weren't you confused? Yes. He told me about the obi. That young man... is from Neishijin, an obi weaver. He thought I was you and said he would weave me an obi. Just before I came, he showed me designs for that obi. It was then... I told him that it wasn't me... it was my sister he met. Really...? That you were called Naeko... and asked him to weave two obis, one for you. For me...? He promised you, didn't he? But that was a misunderstanding. If you're ever in trouble I'd be happy... to stand in for you however I can, but... to receive your gift while impersonating you... I can't accept. You weren't impersonating me. - I was too! That weaver... he's very fond of you, right? I'm a woman too... so I fully understand. In that case... won't you accept it? If I gave it as your sister... to mark our relationship... wouldn't you accept it then. To give to Naeko-san... I wanted an obi... so I asked him to weave one. I'll accept that... Miss. I can close them. I'd like to speak a minute... with you alone. Let's go upstairs, shall we? Talk about what? Today... I went to Kitayama cedar village. There... I met my sister. What's that? - I'm a twin. At this Gion Festival I met her for the first time. Our real mother and father passed away long ago. Kitayama cedar village...? Mother, I can't hide anything from you. At the Gion Festival and today... are the only times we've met. What does she do? She lives with a family working in the cedar village. She's a good girl. I'm very glad you told me. Does she look like you? Very much so. I see. Actually... from the day of the Gion Festival... your thoughts... sometimes seemed miles away. I wondered if you'd fallen in love. I was thinking to ask you. That girl... will you bring her here sometime? After the shop people go home... in the evening. She won't come. She refers to me... as Miss. Hey... which one d'you like best. I like this one better than that. Will he like it? How could I know that? I'll introduce him next time. Shall we go together now? Yes... thank you. But... I don't won't to be a nuisance. Excuse me a minute. After a long time. - Since that evening. I saw you here earlier on. You were helping that lady customer. I wasn't helping her, she asked for me. I prefer to show Tatsumura's woven products... but my duties... include showing minature radios. I also looked at a radio when I came the very first time. Minature radios or silks... a dollar's a dollar. Foreign currency is always good. This is from your companion. "The nuisance is leaving so as not to disturb." My goodness... Has she gone, your friend? Yes, yes... it's okay. - That so. Shall we go see the 'coi'? (ornamental carp) You're finished with those ladies? Sales people here all speak good English. Anyway they go to their hotel for tea about now. I'll just inform them. - Okay. I met your father... two or three times... but perhaps he doesn't like our business? If he saw the minature radios, he would have rolled his eyes. Your father... isn't a businessman. He's an artist. In less polite terms, a 'dreamer'. A "dreamer"...? A fine old shop like Maruta doing such slack trade. What could be the reason for such weak sales? The shop's head clerk... is like a managing director in modern terms. You need to talk to him firmly. If you don't feel you can, I can. Did I upset you? No. Speak strictly. Chieko, you can do it! Yes... I've been working in this shop for twenty years. The boss is a certain type. He entrusts all the business to me. I've never made even a single mistake. Are you saying I've done something wrong? Mr. Uemura, don't misunderstand me. Please think carefully about it. I am the only child of the Sada family, as such I cannot work outside. Gradually I want to study and understand the family business. So I kindly request your help. In that case... yes. If tomorrow's okay with you... can you show me 'the books', please? Books!? The young mistress wants to examine the books? I doubt I'm capable of such a complex thing on my own, only... if I don't try, how can I understand the business? Is that so? You say the 'books' but actually it's more than you think. There are also books for the taxation office. Our shop keeps double books? - What are you saying? Any misrepresentation would reflect badly on your family. The books are correct and accurate. Tomorrow you can show me then, Mr. Oemura? Miss... I've been taking care of this shop since before you were born. What's all this? A pain in the ass. Chieko... what you did was really good. It was hard for me, mother. Young people are scarrier than they look. It felt rather hard just to listen. I got the idea from someone else. Who was this someone? Shinichii's older borother, Ryusuke... of the Tatsumura Shop. Shin-san's father is doing a steady busiiness there. They have two good head clerks. If Uemura were to leave, one could come here... "Or even I could come," he said. You mean Ryusuke could? Yes. He said he will eventually enter business... and so can drop his degree at any time. About father... he said he's a dreamer. Ryusuke said that too? Yes. He seems to understand a lot. That's a nice obi. It's unique. Which client? Miss Naeko. No... Miss Chieko, Mr. Sada's daughter. The design...? Miss Chieko's idea. Oh... Miss Chieko... is that right! A nice tight weave. Keep it up. Hideo... Remember what I said before. We owe Mr. Sada a lot. I hear you, father. As I said before... I started as a sales boy... then started on my own. Finally I managed to pay for a loom. Even then, half was borrowed. Each time I finished an obi... I'd always take it to Mr. Sada. I used to feel shy bringing only one obi... so I'd go quietly in the evening. But Mr. Sada never once... made a face. One loom somehow became three... well, we manage. We're different, Hideo... our class is still lower. As for you Hideo... Mr. Sada's daughter... That's as it is. You've come a long way up the hills. The promised obi... is finally done. So I brought it. An obi for the pretend Chieko. What d'you think? This will be the front... This part comes at the back. Wah... it's too fine for me. The work of a novice isn't too fine. Miss Chieko's idea to use cedar and red pine... only now I'm here, I understand. Day before yesterday Miss Chieko's shop... even sent a kimono and slippers for me. For me... when will I wear it. On the 22nd is the Jidai Festival... can you leave? Yes... they'll let me. Please definitely wear this then. I also want Miss Chieko to see this. Hideo... truthfully... now that I've found Miss Chieko... I want to stop seeing her. Though I'm grateful for the kimono and obi, just this once... hopefully you understand. Yes. This time I won't call Miss Chieko. The Jidai Procession starts from the Kyoto Palace. I'll wait at the Sakaimachi Gate on the south side... Is that okay? Thank you. Sorry. Around here... we make the cedar beautifull. We don't bother much about how we look. Sorry to repeat, Naeko... Jidai Festival, meet me... south of the Sakaimachi Gate. Yes. The Jidai Festival... commemorates Kyoto's history as Japan's capital. The procession shows the various periods during its 1000 year plus reign. On each float people in authentic costumes... portray famous and popular characters from a specific era. Miss, what a beautiful obi. Where did you buy it? The combination looks so good on you Could I see it from the back for a second? Thank you. Sorry to have bothered you. Naeko-san... We meet again. Yes. Brother... Hideo, what are you looking at? The green of the pine trees. Of cousre, the procession too... that is... the green background highlights it beautifully. The wide Imperial compound, the black pines... I love it. You must have caught a glance of it... didn't you notice? You're teasing me! Hello... Chieko...? You two seemed to be enjoying the Jidai procession. - What? You were there too? Why didn't you say something to me then? Ah, I was going to... but my brother stopped me. Chieko... Chieko... Why don't you say something? The one who placed this call was you, wasn't it? Ah... right... you're right. Actually... there's someone who wants to meet you. What... see me? Can you come to the Botanical Gardens? Right. Of course I'll come too. Thank you for waiting - No. Actually, when I called you... it was for him. Chieko... thanks for last time. From me too. Did you speak to the head clerk? Yes. It was a tough task. So today I wanted to ask how it went. The accounts, the bank pass book in the safe... the bank bonds... all that sort of thing I saw. That's great... really great. Chieko, your a kindhearted lady. My brother's coaching you. It's true. I'm not just coaching you. There's a strange rumour going round the shops near me. If you weren't confident to deal with it... I had already decided to come to your shop. Only... it's better you dealt with it yourself. Will the clerk change his attitude? Yes... it seems so. That's how it is then. That's good, no? Yes. Chieko... are you free this evening? - What... Oh yes. - Turtle soup is in season now. I'm in! Will you come? Okay. Chieko... you're all peachy pink. I didn't drink even a little sake. This soup stock is at least half sake. Oh my... Shinichi... - What? The couple you saw in the Imperial compound at the Jidai procession... You mistook someone else for me. You saw from far off. You don't have to hide it. I'm not hiding anything. Actually... that girl... is my sister. What? We are twins. She's my other half. I was abandoned. If that's true... they should have abandoned you by our shop. Brother... she wasn't like she is now. Chieko was just a baby. A baby'd have been fine. But brother... you say that because of how she is now. No. At that time... you were also just a child. Can a child bring up a baby? I could have. You're cocksure as always. You can't give in. That's what you think, only... I could have raised the baby Chieko. Mother would've surely helped me. Father would've been supportive too. Brother, I'm no match for you. We call my brother... wild boar warrior. Wild boar warrior...? If you're not careful he'll knock you flying. Of course a festival acolyte can't beat a wild boar warrior. What...? The one who gets knocked flying is obviously the weaker one. I can't get a break here. But, you're not the only weak one, Shinichi. Who else? Who is it... this other one. You still biting? My... you still remember that. I won't bite. Wan't to try? That's scarry! It's true I don't bite. You're fully depraved now! Was that depraved? Wait just a second. Good... that's much better. - Right... thank you. Ah... this is the girl I met the other day. - Yes, she is. I called her to say hello to you. I'm glad you came. Mr. Sada, you see, really likes Chie-chan. Ah, you have good taste, although... you'll have to wait a long time. Also next year in the spring she's moving to Ponto town. Ponto town... Why? She wants to study as a 'maiko'. ( Aprentice geisha ) It's her dream to become a 'maiko', you see. So chilly... and it's still only November. I'm going out for a bit. Up the mountain? Your outfit gives you away. Well... I'm off then. Ah... Chieko... If you meet the Kitayama cedar girl... if she's ever in trouble... or encounters some hardship... any time you can bring her. We'll take her in. Okay? Your mother and I would be thrilled to find we have two daughters. Father... thank you. Thank you. Chieko... we've raised you from a baby... nothing you could do would make us love you any less. So for this girl, we'd try to love her the same as you. Being like you, she must be a nice girl. Bring her, okay? Father... I am deeply thankful, only... that girl... Naeko would never stay here. Why? She must feel she doesn't want to spoil my happiness even a little. Why should she spoil it? How could she spoil it? Of course twenty years ago people didn't like twins... but now it's no problem. Today... Chieko... I have something to tell you. What is it? Actually... Hideo-san... said he wants to... marry me... and then... And then...? How did you answer him? I couldn't answer such a question right away, you know. After the Jidai Festival procession ended... he invited me home. To his house? Hideo-san's house? - Yes. He has two younger brothers too. He showed me their back garden, and... when we become a couple... he wants to build a small hut there... and then... as much as possible he'll weave his own designs. Hideo-san... told me that. That's good, isn't it? Good but... I think Hideo-san... sees me as your spirit double... and is only marrying me as a proxy you. As a young woman, it's obvious to me. A spirit double? What do you mean by spirit double? A spirit double has no shape, no solid form. But then... that it has no form is what makes it scarry. A spriit double may be just a man's imagination... or even appear in different places. Can we ever be sure? Even if I were a 60 year old grandma, Chieko's spirit double would still appear as young as now. Such an idea, really? A beautiful spirit double would never be boring. In fact... does such a thing really exist? It does. It's here. There is no spirit double. You are my twin sister. See... feel them... aren't my hands warm? But still... Hideo-san... misunderstanding me for you... now is no longer a factor. But deep down in Hideo-san's unconscious, isn't Chieko's presence still deeply rooted. It's not like that. - No... even with no misunderstanding... he'd still be marrying Chieko's proxy. And... Hideo-san is an obi weaver... in which case... I would also... come into contact with Chieko's shop. It would be awkward for you. People would look at you. I'd feel so guilty I'd die. I'd want to hide far, far away in the mountains, or.... Do still you think like that? Naeko... please, just once, come to my shop. Please come. In the evening when everyone's gone home. In the evening? Stay over. My mother and father know all about you, so... At least... just one night... I want to sleep beside you. You should go back. A shower's moving from Shyu ridge toward Kitayama. It'll probably hail too. Has your daughter... told you about our Ryusuke... our "wild boar warrior"? - Yes. I'm well aware I'm not that astute in business. I realize that Ryusuke's offer to help is a kind one. I'm very thankful he's willing to help in our shop, only... if Ryusuke helped us, wouldn't it cause problems... for you? - Well but... if Ryusuke leaves... to help in your shop... my hope is that his younger brother Shinichi would become more responsible. That would be good for me too. Shinichi is a kind hearted boy... so his brother still teasingly calls him a 'temple acolyte'. ( think choir boy ) He must have been very sweet... he and my Chieko have been friends since those days. Talking about your Chieko... Ryusuke, wants to help at your shop... even for half an hour... or one hour... so he's near Chieko. That's his real motive. Though my son is an ordinary boy... I believe he's a good worker. Never... would I try to influence you, but... if there's a chance... Chieko might ever... see Ryusuke as acceptable... even the slightest chance... though I know... it would be too much to ask... could you please adopt him into your family? My family would disinherit him. Disinherit...?! Surely a large wholesaler mustn't lose its successor...? Such conventions... don't ensure human happiness. Having watched Ryusuke lately... this is how I feel. You're too kind. Your offer is very generous. Finally the young people must decide. In the end it depends on how their relationship develops. Chieko... was an orphan. An orphan, so what? Well... this conversation... let's please keep this to ourselves. So Ryusuke... shall I send him to help in your shop? Certainly. - So... thank you, thank you. Number 2,507... Right. Number 2,508... Right. Number 2,509... Right. Number 2,600... Excuse me, but that one... Number 2,601... Right. Number 2,602... Right. Number 2,603... Excuse me... Goodness... Naeko! You are so welcome. Come. Really you are very welcome. This evening has turned quite cold. Listen Chieko... Father and mother... how should I greet them. I explained it all to them. So just say, "I'm Naeko." Come... come in. Come. Come, come. I'm Naeko. - Ahh... You're welcome... truly very welcome. Right? - Yes. Chieko or... Naeko or... Naeko or... Chieko or... What are you saying? Chieko... take her up to the inner room... and talk together comfortably. Yes. Come... Naeko. If all people... were born twins... how would it be? All the confusion, wouldn't it cause trouble. We can never know... a person's destiny. Naeko... wouldn't you like to stay a little longer? Father and mother said so too. I also feel lonely by myself. On the cedar mountain... I don't know how free you are. Miss... our life now is very different... our upbringing too was very different. I can't spend my life living in town. Only once... this one time I've come to your shop. I wanted to show you the kimono you gave. Miss... My parents abandoned one baby. You were that one. That sort of thing... I've completely forgotten it. I think both parents have been punished. Even though I was just a baby... please forgive me. In what way could you... be guilty or responsible? Myself... I don't want to disturb your happiness even the slightest. I wish I could disappear! I can't accept that! It'd be like losing my arm. Naeko... are you unhappy? No. But I am lonely. Naeko... Hideo-san... you should marry him. Though you say you're only my spirit double or proxy... Naeko... just for once, considered getting married? I'm also getting maried. - What! He's from a big wholesale house, MIZUKI Ryusuke is his name. Chieko... that man... I like him. I'm marrying him because I like him. Drizzle... Sleet... Maybe it's wet snow Snow... It's silent, eh. It's snow but not actually snow. It's very fine light snow. This must be happiness. Could this be it? Happiness rarely lasts. Loneliness lasts longer, no? Naeko... I feel warm. I knew it. Our work is different. And where we stay. The evening is getting much colder. Powder snow... sparkles like diamonds. Sometimes it stops... then it sparkles again. Chieko your place is warm now. I'll move... to the other side. Miss... This was the happiest night of my life. Before anyone sees me... I'll go home. Please... won't you come again? Please... you must come again. Miss... goodbye.
