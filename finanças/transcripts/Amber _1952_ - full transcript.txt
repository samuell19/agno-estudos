Some women in this film and their attire. . have no connection with the life in our country. Get up. Why are you sitting in the middle of the road? I want to meet the king. Why did you stop the chariot? A girl is sitting in the middle of the road, King. She says she wants to meet you. Bring her before me. Want to tell me something, dear? - Yes King, I have come to meet you. I have come from very far. See how tired I am. What is it that has brought you so far? And that too, in search of me? I am absolutely alone, King. I have no one in the world. I have no parents, brothers, sisters, nobody. When I was crying a lot, someone told me to go to the King. That you will accept me as your daughter. And hearing that, you set out on a long journey? Yes. If you don't make me your daughter, know what will happen? I will have to go back. I'll get tired and die on my way. No dear, you won't have to go back now. Come with me. Come. Who are you? - Bhim Palasi, King. There is a long story even behind this name. You have saved my life. Tell me, what reward do you want? Make me your attendant, King. I don't want anything else. Take him along to the palace. King, such things should not happen in a palace. Whose antecedents we know not whether good or bad. . don't know where she is from, who her parents are. Giving shelter to such people in the palace is not right. Are you trying to say that goodness. . . .and humanity only exists in palaces. . not in poor people's homes? I only want to say that there is the royal orphanage. Why not send her there? She has asked for a father's love from her King, Divanji. And he is no king who hesitates to grant a wish to a child. Divanji, you may leave. Nana, I will stand here everyday at this hour and wait for your call. What brazenness is this? Is this the palace or a stable? It is a palace. If the horse was real, it would be a stable. Ass! - Horse. Princess! Don't go any further. It's a mountain range. It is dangerous to venture ahead. Hey! who are you? And with whose permission did you fire in our region? And you, who doesn't know how to talk, who are you? Hey! Where are you taking my horse? This is my region. I rule here. Whatever comes here, belongs to me. Whatever comes here, belongs to you? - Talk with some respect. And I think, even you are something good. I'll slap you ! What soft and delicate fingers. Even if you slap me, your fingers will come off and stick to my face. Girls fight with those whom they love. And we don't even know each other yet. Who you are, who I am. . - Are you blind? Can't you see? I can see now! It's like as if the moon has come. . . .and balanced itself on a girl's shoulders. And these dark clouds are kissing the moon's head. Listen, if I tell you I have liked you very much. . . .what reply will you give? I consider talking to people like you below my dignity. You bandit! - Even you are a bandit. I am a mountain bandit, you are a bandit of the plains. Yes. I steal horses, you steal hearts. Return my horse to me. - Return my heart to me. Don't you dare talk such nonsense! I'll have you turned mute. Don't you know who I am? That's what I'm trying to know since so long. I am the Princess. I am the Princess. Princess? Princess. Madam Princess. Being so beautiful, you cannot even lie. I know the King has no children. I am the princess. - Sure! You are the princess, that is why I want to invite you. . and want you to accept my invitation. But I don't accept your invitation. - Then go. I told you that whoever comes to my region has to follow my orders. Come. Sit down. . Sit down.

Eat an apple, Princess. The tree it came from, I have actually reared it with my blood. Once, my finger got hurt. And I had washed my wounds under that tree. This was your doing? One who leaves without permission is shot here, understand? Had I not moved the gun, you would be lying dead here. Saw what your prank did? How will I walk now? Why do you need to walk? You only needed an excuse. Why are you getting angry? You are not light. Who asked you to carry me? Okay. You look beautiful when angry anyways. But your laughter is all the more enchanting. This is my region, I rule here. Even the horses understand my orders. My feet are not of a horse that they will follow your orders.

I am Bhim Palasi. Bhim Palasi? - Yes, there is history behind it. During the Mahabharat times, my father served Bhim. And my grandfather, during the Palasi war. . . . massaged the wild horses. That is why I was named Bhim Palasi. You can call me Bhimu. What have you come here for? I have come to take back the princess. Princess? Who princess? She is the Princess, the King's foster daughter. See! Let's go, Bhimu. Oh, so I will have to come to the palace for another meeting. The palace doors are not open to thieves. No problem, I will find some window or ventilator. Master, senior master is calling you. You called me, father? Yes. Our kingdom is in danger. The rule will change, and the rebels will kill the King. I had staked my life and quelled the rebellion earlier. In the battle, I lost a hand, a leg and an eye. But I saved our kingdom. Pleased with my sacrifice, the King gifted me this estate. But what is the matter today? Why do you look so upset? Our kingdom and the King's life is in danger once again. The mountain tribals have sent someone in the kingdom. . to kill the King. Now that I am crippled, I want you to take the responsibility. . . .of saving the King. Following your orders is my duty. Then take a vow that even if you have to sacrifice your life. . to save the King, you will not hesitate. I vow over your valour and courage. . that until I breathe, I won't let the King come to any harm. Bravo! Whoever attacks the King, I will behead him with your sword. No son, the sword is a coward's first. . . .and a brave man's last resort. Keep it back. The brave use it only when all other attempts have failed. Very well, father. The one who leaves without permission is shot at here. How badly you hit me. This is my region, I rule here. You cannot even stand without my permission here. You have been hit by a bullet. Fall down ! I have been hit by a bullet? You look so good writhing in pain. Eat this apple, it is filled with my blood. Oh no! Look there. I am going. Uncouth fellow! You've lived 10 years in the palace but are still uncultured. We were only playing, Divanji. Here, you also eat the apple. You have not even learnt how to live in a palace. You won't have complaints now, Divanji. Who are you passing through my region without my permission? I am going to the palace. To the palace? Why? The King has called me to the palace to tutor the Princess. Oh, so you are going to the palace to tutor the Princess. The teacher is our guest. Treat him well. Move out of my way. What are you saying? I don't understand. Don't abuse me, I am warning you ! I am not abusing you. It means you will understand only if you have brains in your head. But you only have shit in your head. What did you say? Shit? - Have some manners. Don't you know you are standing before the Princess? Manners? I have been called here to teach manners to the Princess. I am the Princess' teacher. Oh, so you are the teacher? - Yes. And you are the Princess who is brazen, mannerless, etc etc. . and who I have to teach manners, to be civilized, etc etc. Then teach me. Stand straight. Put your hand down. Leg in. Wrong. . wrong ! A crow can never become a swan. An uncouth person is always uncouth. You can never be the Princess. Teacher, you show me how to be a Princess. Handkerchief. . watch. Teacher, if you wear a woman's clothes, you'll become a woman. No doubt. Wrong. . wrong ! Look, I have the King's orders that I can even beat you,. . but I must make you a Princess. Teacher, this is my region, I rule here. Wrong. I will rule here, because I am your teacher. I am your father's teacher too. So you will have to follow my every order. Alright. Teacher, is there no way where you can teach me from a distance? This is the only way I can teach. The one who wants to learn the ways of the royal family. . . .should take me as a teacher. And you must always speak with a bowed head with your teacher. Bow your head. More. Come on. Not so much. . this much. What brazen behavior is this? I am teaching her manners on the King's orders. You use his name and go beyond limit. I'll have to set you right. - You will set me right? But the King rules. - The King only sits on the throne. My orders are followed here. Catch him! Don't I have any of my men here? Ensure you treat the teacher well. I will treat him so well he'll remember all his life. Take him away. Princess, they put your teacher in the bear's cage. Yes, the wild bear who has killed many men until now.

And he is such a good teacher, I just cannot express it. You don't have to express it. It is obvious from his face that he is. . a very cultured and intelligent man. Thank you for this respect. I feel I have seen you somewhere before. King, even I suspect he is an enemy. He has entered the palace in disguise. Your suspicion is right. Raj? - Uncle. . Yes King. Hello Divanji. When did you become a teacher? And what about the one who I had called? Him? Actually, he fell sick when he entered our region. He said if he didn't reach the palace in time,. . . .the King will have him killed. I took pity on him, posed as the teacher and came here. And tried teaching the Princess. Good. A good father's good son should do such things. Now that you are here, be my guest. Come Divanji, let the teacher continue with the tuitions. My father thought of me today. I have told you several times to address me as Divanji. If people come to know of our relationship,. . my honour will be disgraced. But our relationship will not change. It's a blood relationship. So what if the world doesn't know? Johar, you are a big scoundrel. - You are big, father. I am only your son. Anyway, tell me why you called me here Listen carefully to what I say. Go ahead, I am all ears. Because of you, I had made Raj's father, Thakur. . . .who had got very close to the King, distanced from him,. . . . by making the King gift him an estate. I know that. But now, pretending to be in love with Amber. . Raj has become close to the King. And this is very dangerous for us both, specially you. I tried to get him killed by the bear. . but he escaped from even there. I have understood the delicate situation. Tell me what orders you have for me. - Keep an eye on Amber and Raj. Or it may happen that they will grow so close to the King. . that there won't be any distance left between them and the throne. Don't worry, father. A call? Your call has finally come, Nana ! I am coming. I will reach you before this flame extinguishes. You? - Recognised me? Yes. You were my teacher until yesterday. But I am your guest today. A royal guest. You should be showing me some hospitality. Be seated, I'll arrange someone to entertain you. Listen ! No, I still haven't recovered from the earlier show of hospitality. I am your guest. I want you to entertain me. You speak something to me. You hear something from me. Eat this pomegranate. It's seed has come from Kandhar. Eat this apple. It's redness travels from the mouth to the cheeks. Have you heard that couplet? ' My dearest, you have apple like cheeks'' Where is Amber? - Amber?. . Oh yes! Amber! Where is Amber? Nana ( grandfather) ! - My dear. The moment I was waiting for since so many years has arrived today. Even I was waiting for this moment since 10 years, Nana. Then child, make your heart strong. Come with me. Many years ago, the King got his son. . . .who was the heir to the throne. . killed, only because. . . . he married a mountain girl. The King didn't want a commoner and her offspring to enjoy royalty. But what connection does that have with your calling me? That mountain girl was your mother. . on whom the doors of the palace were closed. She committed suicide with this dagger. And then, she came at this spot and jumped into the ravine. Grandpa. Even today, the flowers of her cremation bloom here. And they'll wither only after you take revenge. . . .of the injustice done to her. That is the tradition of us mountain people. I will uphold this tradition, Nana. I vow on these huge mountains. . that I will surely avenge my mother's death. Very good, child. But remember, the man responsible for this tyranny is the same King. . who is rearing you as his daughter since the last 10 years. Whoever it may be, Nana. Nothing is so dear to me that I forget my duty for it. Oh, so that's the case. Since 10 years, it was not an orphan, but a murderess. . . .who was being reared in the palace. Call Raj. Yes Divanji? We are fortunate to have you in the palace. I have come to know that the King is going to be killed today. What! ! Until I am alive, I will never let that happen. That is what I expected of the brave son of Thakur. Don't worry, my shadow will roam every corner of the palace now. As soon as Amber kills the King tonight. . you reach there and take her away. What about Raj who you just called? He will come there to save the King. I will accuse him of murder and arrest him. What about me and Amber? - You will marry Amber. . and become the rightful heir to the throne. Your every move should be calculated tonight. Rest assured, father. The whole creation has been put into these two couplets. Listen. It means. . - I don't want to hear its meaning. I am feeling sleepy, please leave. - You are sleepy? What a great couplet he's made! I feel like digging the poet out of his grave and kissing him. Listen to this. ' My entire family is crazy about your entire family' Will you let me sleep? - Will you sleep standing at the door? I'd come to close the door. Why? Any danger tonight? Yes, a wild animal has entered the palace. Now go, let me sleep. Wow! Wow! Raj, what happened? My foot, King. King. . King ! Thank God you are alive. What happened, Divanji. All the lights in the palace suddenly went off. Since I heard screams from your room, I brought along the guards. Guards, check every corner of the palace and. . . .find out whose doing this is. What is this? I got scared. There is only the skull here, not the skeleton. Raj. Why do you scream? Cowards. - Absolutely! ''My eyes cry with sorrow'' ''I see stars during day'' ''My eyes cry with sorrow'' ''I see stars during day'' ''From the gardens to a cage have come. . '' ''I, a helpless bird'' helpless bird'' ''From the gardens to a cage have come. . '' ''I, a helpless bird'' helpless bird'' ''My heart is with my beau'' ''And I am away from him'' ''Come, O my beloved. . '' ''help my shattered hopes'' ''My eyes cry with sorrow. .

You? Where is Amber? Amber? - Where is Amber? Amber is not here. - How did you come here? I walked. . with Divanji. What happened? - Amber is missing. Today, you lost Amber. One day, you'll even lose the throne. It will not! Move! Stop! What a lovely flower. - Where? Over there. If you can get me that flower. . Why just a flower, you should have asked for my life. Hey! Where are you going? Amber! Stop! Hey! Stop. Raj. I knew you would do this. Children don't play with such things. Divanji, Johar must be killed anyhow. We'll need to strengthen our army for it, King. Know what happened then? The boy took the dagger from the mountain girl. . and killed the other boy. And he caught hold of the girl's hand and. . What kind of behavior is that? Blame it on their age. If we were children, even we would do this. Wait Divanji. I want to say more about Johar. Do you know, if I'd told the King, he'd have got you executed. Not only that, if you like, you can even kill me. But you will never do that. Why? - Because I belong to you. I live and will die with you. But that doesn't mean you try to kill the King and I do nothing. Listen Amber, I have been sent here to protect the King. To even kill the killer if the need be. Then you also hear this, Raj. Even I have been sent here. . because the King is a ruthless man. It is my duty to end his tyranny. The King, ruthless? That's not true. It's a false allegation. Want proof? Then come with me. Before I tell you anything, you'll have to answer my question. Ask. If someone tells you that someone was so unfair to your mother. . . .that she pierced this dagger inside her and. . . .jumped into this ravine. . to die a tormented death. . what would you do then? Look at this dagger and answer me. I would rip open the heart of that ruthless man with this dagger. Then why are you trying to stop me? Let me do my duty. But Amber, your suspicion. . that the King is responsible for your mother's ruin is baseless. Baseless? My mother was married to the King's son. The King did not approve of the prince marrying a mountain girl. He therefore got his son killed. He then shut the doors of the palace to my mother forever. Finally, this dagger became the recourse of a hapless widow. Her flowers still lie in the ravine below. And will not be picked until the tyranny she suffered is avenged. That is the tradition of us mountain people. Sad to hear my story? Yes Amber, so sad, that I cannot express it even if I want to. I know, Raj. I know your every heart beat. Then believe what I say. Maybe the killer is someone else. Amber, the King is not like that. Maybe someone has instigated Nana. - My Nana is never wrong. Man can be wrong, Amber. I will meet your Nana. No Raj, don't go to meet him. If he comes to know you support the King. . he will kill you. And if anything happens to you, I'll become a living corpse. I cannot live a moment without you. Then promise me that until I don't find out the whole truth. . you won't go to the palace. Promise? Order me. I'll do anything you say. Why, what happened? This is a mountain region, and we mountain. . . . people don't meet like that. Then how do you meet? - Coincidentally. Coincidentally? - Yes. You were roaming here. . and I came here coincidentally. Coincidentally, someone arrived, and I left. Bhimu, coincidentally, Raj is our guest. Tell me brother, liked the weather here. How did you arrive here? - Coincidentally. What? How. . Many things happen coincidentally in the mountains. Now that you have come to this mountain. . coincidentally enjoy the hospitality of us people. Coincidentally. ''Our love bond will never break, whatever the world may do'' ''I tell you my heart's feeling, my love'' ''Our love bond will never break, whatever the world may do'' ''I tell you my heart's feeling, my love'' ''Your love, and my youth'' ''Your love, and my youth'' ''Together, they create a sensation'' ''The earth feels delighted. . '' ''The earth feels delighted. .

You came by coincidence,. . got pushed coincidentally, and fell coincidentally in the water. And even Nana came coincidentally. - Nana ! Coincidentally, I was lying, and you really jumped in? Your coincidence wet all my clothes. - But why did you come here? Coincidentally, I was walking here. I coincidentally felt thirsty. . and coincidentally, I came here to drink water. Then drink it, coincidentally. I am fed up of this coincidence. Show me a way where I am saved from this coincidence. There is only one way. - And what is that? Marry me. Tell me, are you ready? - First give your consent. I've already given consent. And your Nana? - Even he will give consent. He will? Then what are we waiting for? We have all our lives to get wet. Go and ask your Nana. What a coincidence! They coincidentally gave consent. Coincidentally. Yes, coincidentally. You want to come out? Come. Amber. Amber. Amber. You are dumb! Don't understand the meaning of this touch? What? It means that Amber has chosen you her husband in everyone's presence. She chose me as her husband? Then what should I do? - As per our tradition. . you should dance with your fiancee. Nana, like her choice? - Amber's choice is my choice. Bhimu, this delicate babe has chosen you her husband. Now get up and dance with her. ''You and me and this beautiful weather'' ''Our love has bloomed in the rains'' ''It rains, my heart sings. .

'' ''with a fire raging in it'' ''You and me and this beautiful weather'' ''Our love has bloomed in the rains'' ''It rains, my heart sings. . '' ''with a fire raging in it'' What have the ladies come to do here? To arrest you. - Arrest me? Why are you scared? My friend, we have a custom. . that the day the groom is chosen, he is dressed up from head to toe. Oincidentally. Can I coincidentally ask why you have not been dressed up? We have a custom that the daughter of the chief is married first. Only after that. . - Only after that? - Got it? By choosing Raj as your life partner, you have betrayed the mountains. . and the customs here. Do you realise that? Nana, what I have done today was after due thought. Forgetting that your mother's flowers are lying as is? And your father's killer is still alive? Had I forgotten that, I would not choose Raj my life partner. Why don't you understand, Nana? Until Raj is in the palace. . I cannot avenge the tyranny my mother suffered. Nor can I fulfill the promise I gave you. I have brought him here with that thought. I don't understand. Then know this forever. I will forget the world forever. . but not you, my mother, these mountains, and these valleys. Apart from this, whatever happens before the eyes. . treat it as a game and just keep watching it. Will this game become reality? Have faith in me, Nana. I know marrying Raj is touching limits. But when I reach that limit, don't stop me. Maybe there is some meaning even behind that. Friend, you look just like a mountain groom. But where is the bride? - You are very desperate. She's a bride, she'll take time. We have a custom that the bride and groom don't see each other for 7 days. It is just the first day today, and only 7 minutes since you saw her. First day? Seven days? I know where Amber has gone. Raj. Raj. No, let me go. Look Bhimu, an innocent man will be killed. Raj. No, Raj. - Let me go. - Raj. An innocent man will be killed, Bhimu. Yes. - Where had you gone, dear? I went to Raj to see his estate. Where is Raj? His father asked him to stay back for 3-4 days. Look what a beautiful portrait it is. Whose is it? My son's. - What? If he was alive, he'd be my support. If I can find his killers, I'll get them skinned alive! Who are his killers? Those cruel people. . who consider the association of the poor with the rich a crime. They killed my son only because the poor fellow married a mountain girl. What right did they have to separate two lovers? What wrong had he done? Even the mountain people are respectable people. Do you really think so? - Don't you believe me, dear? No one believes me. Everyone thinks I got him killed. Anyway, I just have to swallow my tears now. I lost my son when he was in the prime of his youth. I had a daughter-in-law and her kid. They could have lived with me, but fate didn't will even that. My daughter-in-law jumped from a cliff and committed suicide. And the poor kid. Wonder where she is and in what state. If I find her, I'll hug her! - Father, I am that girl. I am your granddaughter, Amber. My child ! What mistake did you make me pay for. . that you kept this fact a secret from me for 10 years? Not mistake, a conspiracy. A conspiracy to kill you. That was the intention of this girl. . for which she lived in the palace for 10 years. I know these mountain people very well. They are after your blood. See this dagger. This means that we have been so cruel to the mountain people. . that today, my own granddaughter was compelled to kill me. Father, your regime has really been tyrannical to them. They still have not been able to forget my mother's death. And even my Nana believes that you got your son killed. I am shocked to hear that. Go to Nana today itself. . and tell him his assumption is baseless. Also tell them that I am ready to hand over my throne to my granddaughter. . and leave on a pilgrimage. Tell them that this palace is their home. It's doors are closed to none. Go, my dear. Hurry. Soldiers. . Divanji. . - Yes King? Let's play a game of chess. Amber, you are a prisoner in this palace now. The reason why I tolerated the pain of separation from you. . that same reason is flowing along with your tears. . . .from your eyes today. Forgive me Nana, my hands trembled. They trembled because you went to the palace and forgot these mountains. You forgot your relatives, your duty. The King is very good. He wants to hand over the throne to me. . and leave on a pilgrimage. Pilgrimage? To seek pardon for the tyranny done to us? Or to ask for strength to be more brutal to us? No Nana. He says we are related to him by marriage. That the doors to the palace are always open for us. If you don't believe me, come and see for yourself. Only my dead body will go to the palace. If I have to go, I'll go the day I believe. . that my first step in the palace will hit the King's body. Don't say that, Nana. The King has called you with true feelings. How ironic! A man who got his own son killed to quash a mother's right. . the daughter is defending him. No father can get his son killed. You are mistaken. - Shut-up, girl ! If you have turned disloyal,. . it doesn't mean even we mountain people have no integrity. I still have the strength to make the tyrant bow at my feet. . and punish him for every atrocity. King, the message of friendship you sent to the mountain people. . they have sent these dead bodies in reply. These dead bodies are proof that they are our enemies. They will resort to bloodshed. How can they hold themselves back unless those misunderstandings. . which have been created between us are cleared. This is not misunderstanding King, it is enmity. No, it is a misunderstanding that has turned into enmity. Go to his region today itself and bring Nana here with respect. I will speak to him as my son's father-in-law. King, you. . - Divanji, just follow my orders. I have brought the King's message. . that the murderess who you are sheltering. . I arrest her and bring her to the palace. What if I refuse to hand her over to you? Then as per the King's orders, I'll have to take the help of the army. But I will not do that, Nana. - You will ignore your King's orders? Yes. Not because I fear you, but because I respect. . . .your valour and honesty I know the King has committed many atrocities on you. Even now, there is not a day,. . when conspiracies are not hatched to kill you people. Have you come here to give this news? Not just that, I have come to extend a hand. . . .of friendship towards you. I have come to make an offer that let us together dismiss the King. I want to see you on the throne, Nana. Come. No! I consider it a humiliation to join hands with a traitor. I don't want the throne. I only ask for my right. Once we get our right, we'll have no enmity with the King. As brave as you are Nana, you are equally naive. A man who, to snatch your daughter's royal right. . got his own son killed by Thakur. . and now, has appointed the same Thakur's son, Raj to kill Amber. What? He has appointed Raj to kill Amber? Hit slowly. Seven days are over. The bride has come. Why are you quiet? Laugh. Why don't you laugh? Your vow has been fulfilled today. Raj, I am innocent. - Innocent? You take advantage of a man's love, keep him confined for seven days. . and then say you are innocent? Raj, believe me, I truly love you. Your eyes would surely express love,. . but there is cunning and slyness filled in your heart. Believe me Raj, I love you. Believe you? To be cheated again? I will end this episode right here. Raj, I love you. - Lair! Cheat! ''I love only you'' ''I love only you'' ''What do you know, my naive lover'' ''You got annoyed, I am heart broken'' ''What do you know of my pain'' ''I love only you'' ''When you made me yours'' ''Why didn't you understand the state of my heart?'' ''You chose a flower. . '' ''You chose a flower and threw it away'' ''You did not even recognise its fragrance'' ''You spurned my love'' ''What do you know of the injustice you did me'' ''I love only you'' ''The world of love being ruined. . '' ''is no easy pain'' ''Full of desires. . '' ''My heart full of desires. . '' ''is soft, but not naive'' ''You may turn away from me'' ''But yet my love for you won't change'' ''I love only you'' ''I love only you'' ''What do you know, my naive lover'' ''I love only you'' I knew even you will be dumped like this one day. Whose feelings have been played with, has a right to spurn. Not only that, he even gets a right to cheat in love. . and then wait to attack. Who is waiting to attack? Me, or your darling Amber? Ask her. - I don't need to ask her. Can't I see that using the ruse to love her,. . you are waiting for an opportunity to kill her? It is she who put on act of loving me for her own selfish reasons and fooled me I thought the mountain people are honest, respectable, and men of word. But the truth has made realization dawn on me. You people are frauds. - You and your family are frauds. Mind your tongue! Don't give up your decency. Decency? The trend you and your father have begun of killing people. . and being rewarded with estates, is that decency? Your age and seniority is stopping me, Nana. Or I would make you dumb for humiliating my family. A lair wants to silence the tongue that speaks the truth? What are you saying, Nana? - Naive girl, I am saying. . that truth still exists. He doesn't love you. He is fooling you. . and is secretly trying to kill you. That's not true. - It is true. He is the son of that murderer, who, for the greed of an estate. . killed your father. And today, he has even come to kill you in a similar manner. So that you don't become the heir to the throne. That's not true, Nana. Is this also not true, that your father had ordered you. . to follow Amber like a shadow in the palace? My father sent me with instructions that before someone kills the King. . I should kill him. See, he is himself admitting why he came in your way. . why he pretended to love you. Only so that he kills you somehow. . no one comes to know, and then the King rewards him another estate. No Nana, if that was true, I would not be alive today. Had he only told me, I'd even kill myself for him. Raj, say this is not true. Your father did not kill my father. Say it, Raj. If it is proved that my father is the culprit. . I promise you I will myself bring him to you. What a nice excuse you found to escape. But who will let you leave alive from here now? Vultures will hover over your corpse in these very mountains. Nana, I plead with you ! - Amber! Love can blind you, not me. Arrest the rascal. This region is weird. The mountains are so tall, they touch the skies. And the people living among them so base. . that they attack their guest. You levy a false charge, then atleast give me. . . .an opportunity to clarify. Nana, I am a daughter of these mountains. But right now, even I would think like Raj. A man is asking for a chance to defend himself. . but he is not being given the opportunity. This injustice will bring slur to us people. Alright, you can go, Raj. But remember. . if you don't return. . there is still an amber burning in your heart that will destroy you. He will never come back now. My heart says Raj will surely return. Brought Nana along? - No. I pleaded with him. . to come and meet you in the palace. He flatly refused, and said he will not come until he gets the message. . . .from you in writing. - Then send him a message in writing. I have prepared it, it only needs to be signed by you. I'll happily sign it. Arrest him. Divanji, what does this mean? As per this paper you have just signed. . . .you are handing over all administrative powers to me. . . .and leaving on a pilgrimage. Divanji, you cannot use law and keep me confined for long. The Lord of Lords will never forgive your betrayal. Take him away. One thorn is out of the way. Another poisonous one still exists. Father, is it true that all your life. . you only desired to kill heirs to the throne? Why are you silent? Is it true your biggest dream was that the way you killed Amber's father. . likewise, even I should kill Amber? Tell me, father. Say that's a lie. So that the world doesn't say that a son got his innocent father arrested. Because I have promised, that if you are truly a killer. . I will arrest you and take you before Nana. Tell me, father. Are you listening? I have promised. I have promised. Speak, father. Take him away and put him in prison. Saw how our tricks are working, Johar? Now listen. Alright, father. - Call me Divanji. Nana, what I feared happened. You didn't leave me fit to face the King. On one hand, I praised you to the hilt before the King. And on the other hand, you did something that has put me to shame. What do you mean? I mean that your men have stolen the royal horses. Lies! Wrong ! It's all lies. The truth is always obvious. Come out and I'll show you the prints of their hoofs. I don't believe you. This is some conspiracy. If the proof is so near, let's go and have a look. Come. Look, the hoof prints. Come a little ahead. . and you will know how many horses were stolen. Count them. Wait! Let Divanji move a little. - Alright. You witnessed it yourself now. . how deceiving the people who live in palaces are. I have never come across such baseness, such betrayal. The rogues! They cheated you and killed you. A man who can get his own son killed. . this is something very simple for him, Amber. Nana, I have realized today. You won't trust them now, will you? Never! Don't forget the flowers of your mother. That tradition. . - I'll never forget. King ! I knew you will come here carrying a dagger. Where is the King? - Consider me the King. Whatever you want to say, tell me. - Where is the King, Divanji? He is missing. - Oh ! Like his son went missing. . even the King went missing. Right Divanji? Shut-up, Amber! Or I will crush your very existence. What will you crush anyone? Forget as a king, your existence even as a human is a deception. A mouse is telling a mountain his existence is a deception. . when the mountain just threw a stone and the mouse died. Like the joke? Don't forget Divanji, that when God wants. . he can make even a mountain crumble in moments. No one can make me crumble. Take her away and put her in the dungeon. My destiny is shining. Whatever I do, I am succeeding. All hurdles in the path of my greed and ambition. . have been removed. Now, it's just me! This kingdom, the throne, the crown, everything belongs to me! Johar, you? - Yes, it's me. You sent me to Nana so that I kill him. And his men kill me? Your last trick didn't work. I managed to survive. Johar, if you care for your. . - No, I want the throne! I followed your every order for this throne. I killed the King's son. I killed Raj's father. I killed Nana. Not so that you sit on this throne. Shut-up! Is anyone there? I am no fool, father. I give orders in this palace now, not you. Bring Amber from the prison. ''In this world. . '' ''In this world. . '' ''In this world, no one is loyal'' ''It is rightly said'' ''It is rightly said'' ''It is pointless to love anyone here'' ''It is rightly said'' ''It is rightly said'' ''Life is full of sorrow and pain'' ''It is rightly said'' ''It is rightly said'' ''The heart finding peace here is difficult'' ''It is rightly said'' ''It is rightly said'' ''Even he left me. .

Raj ! Leave me! My son ! I have come, my dear. Open the door! Raj, I have come. Son, open the door. Mother! - My son ! My son ! Snake. . snake! Where is the snake? Snake. Snake. Snake! Guard, a snake! - Where? Over there. Let's go. - No wait. Amber has been imprisoned by Johar. - So what do I do? What do you do? Strange man you are. Don't you know Amber loves you? I know very well how she loves me. - What do you know? We mountain people are tough, that is why she behaves tough. Or she loves only you. Get them. Get them. - Someone come here. Hold them. Hold them. Hold them. Like this? - No. You will surely like this. - No. You don't like this, nor that ; then what do you like? I don't like anything. You nuts! You told me you have brought stuff. . . .that will please the bride. And this is what you have brought? - Why do you worry, sir? Just keep watching. A dagger, sir. A cat, sir. A mug, sir. A traditional pipe, sir. A sage's pot. Congratulations sir. Play it. - A musical instrument. A lively dog. - From Assam. A lovely cat. - From the Himalayas. A lively rabbit. - From Assam. A dead tiger. - From Burma. Take it all away, I don't want anything. Then coincidentally, look here once. Keep watching, sir. Wow! Wait. Wait. I'm not through. A mountain groom's attire. After wearing this, the groom cannot see the bride for seven days. I am not foolish not to be able to see my bride for seven days. But sir, coincidentally, this is a mountain tradition. Coincidentally. And see this. Smile. This coincidentally is the bride's attire. I like this very much. - See! Even I like you very much. - What nonsense are you talking? I said it on your behalf. Very good. I am very happy with you. You have pleased my wife. If you give me a chance, I will please your bride more. How? - With fire works. We burst crackers at weddings. As soon as they burst, the mountain bride and groom start dancing. With such abandon that the marriage becomes a major affair. If you permit, shall we dance at your wedding too? Sure, you have my permission. But we have a whole group of dancers. They will not be permitted inside the palace. Here's my ring. You can show this and enter the palace. Go. . you also leave. Look, Johar king's ring. He has invited the king to his wedding. Don't you recognise the King's ring? Open the doors quickly.
