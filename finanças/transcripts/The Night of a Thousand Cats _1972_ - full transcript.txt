I would like to stay with you forever. On that we agree, and I would like you to stay with me, but in a place where no one could touch you. For example, in a crystal cage. Dorgo, this is Christa. Come on. I'm sorry. It's his face, the cold stare. Somehow he scares me. My dear, it's your imagination. Dorgo's an excellent butler. He's obedient and as faithful as a cat. I inherited him along with this monastery. It was built in 1600 by the Carmelite order of nuns. It's been in my family for over 150 years. All of my ancestors had a mania for collecting: Stamps, coins, porcelains, and weapons. They covered the walls with their valuable collections, but I donated everything to several museums so that everyone could appreciate them. But my collection is going to be the most original and most interesting of all. You will see. I want you to feel at home. I see your butler is very well trained. Yes, he knows exactly what I want. Who else lives here? Some very charming and silent guests. You'll meet them after you've had dinner. You've never tasted anything as delicious as this. Dorgo is a great cook, and meat is his specialty. Don't be afraid, I'll be right back. Don't leave me alone, I'll go with you. I'm going to show you the rest of the place. All these were shot by my grandfather. Besides being a great hunter, he was a taxidermist. I think he enjoyed stuffing them more than killing them. Don't be afraid. They're only made of wax. Let's get out of here, Hugo. It's horrible. Yes? Yes, just a moment, I can't hear. Well, maybe the helicopter. He almost has it in my lap. No, no, don't hang up. I'll use the other phone, huh? Come dear, your daddy is getting ready to leave. Bye bye. Bye, dear. - Bye, daddy. - Behave yourself. I will. Wave goodbye. Goodbye. Checkmate. Salud. I'm going to show you something that only two people in the world know about. Wait here. Good evening, I'm sorry to bother you. I'm a doctor. I was on my way to visit a patient when my car broke down, and I wondered if you could help me. I'm sorry there's nothing we can do for you. Now listen, it's a little girl, and she could be seriously ill. I must get to her right away. I told you there's nothing we can do. Take him in your car, Hugo. Don't worry about me, I have to leave. Wait. My little girl's home alone. At least let me call for a taxi. Okay, come in. Thank you. Dorgo, the cats are hungry. Daddy, daddy. There's my girl. Hi, dear. Have you been a good girl? No, Dorgo, not her. I just made a decision, Paulette, the most beautiful one of my life. I'm going to bring you something that I think will make you very happy. Mommy! Darling, what's wrong? What is it? Nothing, I have a headache. Are you feeling better? What are you thinking about? About how wonderful everything has been between us. You know something. I'm going to do everything in my power to keep you near me. I hope that you really can find some way to do it. All things have a beginning and an ending, and nothing can change the fact that life ends with death. Hello, yes, how are you? I'm fine. Where? Wonderful. I'll be right over. What happened? Where are you going? I'm sorry, I have to see the guy who pays for all of this. Please lock the door when you leave and call me some other day. Fine, Dorgo. Checkmate. You're learning. What happened? I came too close to the coral. Let me see. It's nothing. Let's go eat, I'm starving. You go. You have that head pain again? I'm worried about something I have to finish. Is it important? I have to find a way. Why did you stop? This is the place. Let's go back, it's getting late. It's already too late. I've found the right piece for my collection. Cathy. Cathy? Cathy? Cathy? Cathy? It's been hell waiting all these days to have you here again. You don't know how much I've looked forward to it. Me too. Let's finish what we started the other night. I'm going to show you something wonderful, my collection, and there's only one person in the world who knows it. Only one person? Yes. I thought you told me the other night that two people knew about it. That's true, there were two people who knew about it, Dorgo and myself, but now, he's part of my collection.
