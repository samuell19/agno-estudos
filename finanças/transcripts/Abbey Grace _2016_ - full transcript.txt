Everything must be stacked perfectly with exactly one pinky's-width betwen each row. Your pinkies are smaller than mine so you'll have to adjust for that. Got it? - Maybe this will work. - Anyway, I fixed it this time but please, be more thoughtful in the future. - You know, you're amazing. Not a single can out of place but you can't lift a single finger to help clean the house. - My house, my dirt. - Thought it was Mom's house? - Was. - Ben, you've gotta be realistic. I can't stay here forever and just keep taking care of... - No one is asking you to. - Ben, you gotta learn to take care of yourself or go somewhere someone else can. If you would just let me try a little bit of behavioral therapy, I know that I would be... - Don't analyze me! I'm not one of your case studies. Now, please, keep that slobber bucket away from me.

I dropped everything to come here. My practice is hemorrhaging money so I can be your maid and plan a funeral for a woman I couldn't stand. - And there's another thing, I asked you to put fresh flowers at her grave two days ago. - Would you look at yourself? You don't have a life because of Mom. How can you still care about that crazy woman? - She wasn't crazy. She felt things, she knew things. - She knew how to control you. - She just wanted us to be safe. You never understood her or me. You left the first chance you got.

You've moved my water. (SIGH) - I haven't touched your stupid water. Why would I touch your water? - So you wouldn't have to go back and get more. - You know, I don't have the energy for this today. (QUIET SQUEAL) (RUSTLING LEAVES) (GLOOMY MUSIC) - I think we should talk about our situation. - I'm done discussing coconut water. - No, not that. I mean, our living situation. Well, you've been here for two weeks and I don't feel like you're making an effort. - Oh, really? - Wait. I have more. First, you mock me and you treat me like a child and then you make me beg for what little help you do give. I need you here for me. And sometimes you're just plain hateful. - Not trying? Take a look in the mirror. Hateful, sometimes but you're ungrateful and lazy. You know, since you won't accept any real help from me anyway, maybe you just don't need anyone here at all. So, believe me, as soon as Duke's better, we're gone. - Wait. I don't want that. I'm sorry. Let's just try to treat each other better. Can we agree on that? - Sure. Look, I need to tell you something. Ben, I think you're getting worse. I called a colleague of mine, Dr. Thompson, to come out... - No! I'm not the crazy one. Call him and tell him not to come. - It's too late. - Well, when he gets here than I'll just throw him out... - What is it? - Nothing, there's just a pretty girl standing in the doorway. - No there isn't. That's the doctor you're gonna throw out on her ass. Hi. - Hi, how are you? So good to see you. - [STACEY] Oh my, goodness. Come in. - Thanks. And you must be Ben. How are you? - I'm uh... - OK, we'll come back to you later. - Cool house. - It was a boarding school for girls. - Hmm. - [BEN] It closed in 1919 when the headmistress hanged herself. - Ew, and you grew up here? - She didn't do it in the house. - Your brother seems so sweet. - Yech, don't let him fool you, he's crazy. - Crazy cute. - [STACEY] Mmm... (RIP) (SCREAM) - Everything OK in here? - Look. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) Somebody should check that out. (SIGHS) - I guess it's up to me. - I guess, I guess I could go. - [STACEY] Yeah, save it. God. (FOOTSTEPS) (SCEAM) - Stacey! Are you alright?! (SCREAM) - Stacey! Please, say something! - It's a spider! I got it! That's weird. (PANTING) I don't see anything. (SIGH) Sorry, I hate those little bastards. Anyway, there's nothing up there. Not a speck. But I did find this really weird painting. - I'm not staying in here. - There's always Mother's room. - That's where she died. - Pass. Anybody die on the couch? (CREEPY CHORAL MUSIC) - So, last night was pretty strange. Does that sort of thing happen a lot? - Not so much. - Your house is kind of freaking me out. I did some research. They said that there was a punishment room where the headmistress locked up the little girls for days. - Not likely. I know every inch of this house. One of the benefits of being a shut-in. Wait a minute. That's her. Stacey, that's the girl I saw petting Duke. Her hair is cut up but that's her. See, she even has the leg brace on. - That photo was taken in 1919, so... - Third from the left, Abbey Grace. Hey, isn't that one of the names from your painting? - After they closed this school, hmmm, it was sold as a private residence where, in 1943, another little girl slaughtered her family. - Any good news in there? - Not really. After she killed her family, she hung herself from your oak tree. - Wow. - I don't get it. How does a child manage to kill her whole family? - I don't know, element of surprise? - I'm gonna go in town, gonna go check on Duke. - You're going in to town? - [STACEY] Yeah. I'll get your coconut water. - Ben? I'd like to help you with your issues. Would that be OK? Great. So, you said that touching was a major challenge for you. Let's just jump in with both hands. (GASPS) Sorry, hold on. OK. So, when did it all start for you? Like, what age do you think? See, it's good. It's good. Ben, you're doing so good. Are you ready to take another step further? Ready? Good job. And we're just gonna take step. You know what? It's OK. It looks like rain, anyways. (BLOWING WIND) - Geez. (WHOOSH) (SLAM) (THUD) (WHIMPERING) - Ow, ow ow. (PANICKED GASPING) Stacey.

Hell, it'll probably do him some good. - Stacey. - You go, he'd rather you check on him anyway. - Fine. Ben? Are you alright? I knocked but you didn't answer. - It's the craziest thing. I was reviewing the footage from the basement and, well, let me just show you. - Footage? - Yes, Mother had cameras put in. (CLICKING) I swear, I saw something reach from the shadows and grab me. You believe me, right? - Of course I do. - I can't, I'm sorry, I can't. - No, you were traumatized. It was wrong of me. (UNSETTLING AIRY MUSIC) (THUD) (SIGHS) - You're so stupid. So stupid. You're so stupid. (SIGHS) (MUFFLED, ANGUISHED CRIES) Stacey, is there something wrong with your leg? (MUFFLED, ANGUISHED CRIES) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) (GASPS) - What the Hell, Stacey? - You got to be kidding me. This is weird, even for his standards. I can't even take this. - Calm down. We'll just put everything back. - Put what back? - This is too much, Ben, even for you. - You really think I did this? - Who else? You stack shit everywhere. Everything's lines up perfect and organized. I'm sure by some sort of screwed-up logic of yours. - There must be a simple explanation. You could have done it without knowing, Ben. - Me? What about Stacey? She's trying to drive me crazy so she can write about it in her stupid book. Yeah, I know about that. You should write about yourself. I'm not the one who had the breakdown. - Stacey? - What happened when I was 17 has nothing to do with this, Ben. You're just messing with me. - The video. We can watch the video. (CLICKING) (SNARL) - Holy shit, what the Hell was that? - It's Abbey Grace, look. - Back it up. - You saw it, right? - Yes. - Stacey, you too? - Yeah, right, Ben, this isn't funny. I don't know how you did that. Stop screwing with me. - I did nothing. - Come on, guys. Stacey! - He rigged it somehow. Just to get attention. - I believe him. - What? - I'm not saying that he didn't do it but maybe he just doesn't know that he did it. - Well, either way, I just can't do it anymore. When Duke's better, I'm just gonna put him in a facility and sell the house. - He's all the family that you have. Just don't make any rash decisions. What if...? - What? - What if he didn't do it? How would you explain it? - I don't know, what do you think? - Maybe we have some kind of OCD poltergeist on our hands. - So, you think my mother came back and rearranged the kitchen? (LAUGHS) - Maybe. I'm gonna go inside. You coming? - Yeah, soon. - [BRIDGET] OK. (PLINKY MUSIC BOX) - How did you get out here? (EERIE MUSIC) (DRIPPING WATER) (ROAR) (HEAVY DRUMBEATS) (GASPING) (COUGHING) (SIGHS) How was your bath? (CRYING) Are you alright? OK. (SOBBING) OK. - It was like, something pulled me under and Ben said that something grabbed him and pulled him in to the basement. What is it? - I thought I saw Duke's reflection in the mirror the other night. I just dismissed it. I just thought I was tired. - I know a guy, his name is Roman, he's like a spiritualist. I can call him. - I don't know. I don't think Ben would let anybody else in the house. - But think about it. Weird things are happening. Duke, he's like the sweetest dog I've ever met and he tried to kill you. - I know but the vet said it could have been Xanax, a reaction to it or there could be some bacteria in the system or something. I just... - Maybe it was but what if it wasn't? (KNOCKING) - Yeah? - Can I come in? - Alright, sure. - I'm sorry about earlier. - We all are. Tell him, Stacey. (SIGHS) I'll call him now. - You can use my phone. It's the only land-line we have. (MUFFLED, ANGUISHED CRIES) (INTENSE DISCORDANT MUSIC) (ROARING SCREAM) - OK, I'll pick you up at the airport.

(SLURPING) - Hey, guys. - [BEN] What's he doing? - He said to give him a minute. (KNOCKING) Anything? - In a minute. From what you've told me, I think you have a restless spirit. - A demon? - No, a demon is a whole different story. A spirit is usually just looking to move on. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) - Move on? - To the afterlife. When we die, one of three things happens. Our souls go to Heaven or Hell. Sometimes something holds us here. It's very very rare. A spirit becomes violent or even able to enter the human realm again. - But, if that's the case, why did it push me down the steps? - And me in the tub? - Rare, but not impossible. There had to be evil and violence that contributed to their death. A touch of darkness enters their soul and drops it here. It's consumed by evil and wreaks vengeance on anyone it can connect to. (GAGS AND SNIFFS) (INTENSE DRAMATIC MUSIC) - Stacey? - It's OK. Everyone has their own beliefs. - Do we have a problem here? - Not sure. I'd love to look around, see if I can determine what it is. - Can we help? - No, just give me a couple of hours. - But what if it is a vengeful spirit? - Let's pray not. (INTENSE DRAMATIC MUSIC) (CREAK) (OMINOUS MUSIC) I'm gonna need my holy water for this one.

That's not an option. - Listen to me, for your own safety, you need to get the Hell out, now! I'm calling a cab and I'm out of here. - No! - It's OK now. I'm never gonna leave you again. We'll never leave this place. (CREEPY MUSIC) (METALLIC RATTLE) (BEEPING) (RATTLING) - And hurry. (INTENSE DRAMATIC MUSIC) (PANICKED GROAN) - Why was Roman's bag outside? - [BEN] We've got problems. - Roman's gone. - What do you mean, gone? - I don't know, he said he was calling a cab. - He wouldn't have just left his bag out there, would he? - Maybe he's still around. - We should look for him. Maybe he changed his mind. - Yeah, Stacey and I can go look outside. - You just stay and look in here. - Roman?! Roman?! (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) - Roman? Roman? Roman? Roman, are you here?
