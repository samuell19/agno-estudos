Play one of the best new FPS shooters, search Steam for PROJECT WARLOCK So let's take a look at the actual X-ray. I think you'll get a better sense of what we're dealing with here. It's your lungs. You see up here in the corner, that area that... that... Mr. Cady, we need to talk about this. There's a lot... Drinking on the job again. Maybe I'll have one with you. Roy, you're working later. You and Angelo are visiting Frank Sinkowski tonight. Feds are pressing on the port probe. Nobody should get hurt bad. I don't want that now. I just need the guy to understand the right thing. He just needs to play for the team's all. One more thing. No guns. What? I don't want someone getting shot over someone's bullshit nerves. Remember that trucker last year? I'm telling you, and I'm telling Angelo. Don't let me find out you went in packing. - The guy going to be there? - He will. I'm sending him a care package. You, uh, tell that doctor about your chest? He... He said it was nothing. Well, that's excellent news. Everything's fine, then? It's fine with me. Did you see the boss with your girl? Yeah. Why is she with him? She's a slut. Don't say that. I don't need to talk about her like that. Then don't talk to me about her. Let's go. I don't know how she could go from you to Ptitko. If she knew some of the shit he's done... You gonna tell her? She knows exactly what she's doing. You take the front. I'll take the back. Fuck's sake, it's one goddamn lawyer. We have to move. Come on. We have to get out of here. Move! Move! Are you gonna kill me? No. Get out. Can I have a shirt? Wait here. Why'd those men want to kill you? Well, seems like some kind of setup, some bullshit over a woman. How'd you find yourself there tonight? I's from Orange, Texas. I knew this girl. What? Vonda. She told me she worked for herself. I didn't really know anything about that stuff, so it was in the phone book. Perfect Choice Escorts. It was like a real business in the phone book. I didn't know. One of the owners of that real business is a guy by the name of Stan Ptitko. You ever meet him? No. Maybe I heard the name. Who's that? He's the guy that tried to have me killed tonight. These three guys came in and just kept hitting this guy until he showed him where something was. And then they shot him. They made me wait, told me I was next. So fucking happy you killed them. So we got away? It may take a while for them to figure out what happened, but they can't let us go. That guy Stan Ptitko, he don't want any noise. The only thing we can do now is get as far out of town as possible and then find a place to lay low. After that, I don't know. I really want a drink. I kind of want several. Like a whole pitcher of single malt. Starting to feel like I never needed a drink as bad in my life. Well, you're young yet. Maybe I can just tag along with you a while. Drop you in Orange. You can go back to your family. Mnh-mnh, no. I ain't going back there. You can just leave me right here. How much money do you have? None. I don't want your money. I had my own money in New Orleans. You're the one who kidnapped me. I don't even know your name. I saved you. Be clear on that. Cheer up. You're alive. I'm buying.

You think about that. All right, baby. We're going on a trip. Gonna get us off the road for a bit, let the dust settle. - Help you? - Two single, each for a week. They yours? Nieces, my sister's. $387 with tax. You're a darling little girl. How old are you? 31/2. Well... 105 and 106, just right outside. I'm Nancy Covington. I'm always here. I'm good friends with lots of policemen, just so you know. I mind what goes on in those rooms. I appreciate it, Nance. Good Lord, that's a beautiful little girl. You're the cutest thing I ever did see. - What do you say? - Thank you. Thank you. Every day, I hear complaints from you! Who paid for the room? Who takes care of the kid? Here's your shirt back. Can I have a cigarette? I've been thinking. How old are you? Mm... 40. I'm 19. Man, that's nothing, right, no matter what's happened? That's right. You got... You got your whole life ahead of you. You can start your life over three, four times if you want. What were you doing at 19? Running playback bets in Louisiana and Mississippi mostly. How'd you get into that? Hmm. Think I really kind of fucked things up. You don't need to think about it that way. I grew up in Orange. Nothing changed out there. Hot, same fields, same grass. Nothing to do day after day. I just kept thinking I wanted a real life. You want to leave, it's okay. Get some sleep. We'll figure it out tomorrow. I had a nightmare. Can I stay with you? What? Hot one over here. The one on the grill or the one standing? No word on the Kestrel. I just found out. So that's a bust. I don't know what that is. Offshore rig. Well, we came down here 'cause I was supposed to get work on one for City Service. Mama said she's hungry. She don't need no sausage. You tell her I said so. Well, I get down here, and they say they never hired me. I tell them I got a letter. Well, they tell me the letter don't say what it says, and I'm holding the letter. You got another? You know, she's never been to the ocean. Aah! Thank you. Hey, brother. Want a cold one? I got a long-term deal here, kind of come and go as I please. I seen a lot of crazy shit but never a murder. One of the kids finally said something to the owner. I guess he did it to her earlier in the day. Where'd you do your time, bro? Them girls your nieces? Yeah. Yeah, we're on vacation. Cool. Listen, I was... I was wantin' to talk to you. I was... I was wondering if you're looking for work at all while you're, you know, on vacation. Yeah, what you got, kid? Got like $20,000, man. There's a guy runs a clinic on Broadway. Place is a drug jug. I know the cleaning lady. What? You take down doctors? I am a thief, and I'm a real, real good one. This guy has a sampler pharmacy on the premises. I'm talking now benzies, dixies, biphetamine, amphetamine. My maid, she fronted me Polaroids of the layout. Three days for us to move it in Corpus and Houston. $20,000 might be low-balling it, even. What do you need me for? I need somebody to front a van, help me move it. I got all the clients, but, you know, people wanting product are, more or less, scum of the earth. Someone like you at the table when the deal goes down, things go smoother. You seem like a good kid, but you got the wrong idea. We're just down for some sun and waves. You could take care of them girls a lot better with this score. You don't need 10 grand, man? Not where I'm going. Thanks for the beer. Who is this? You know who this is, you son of a bitch. You took pictures of my lungs. Yes. I remember, Mr. Cade. How long do I have? I can't say. I just... How long? You need to come back in. We need... Roy, you didn't... We need to do a biopsy. You just left, and we... You sawbone quack motherfucker. You want me to come back in? I'll come back in, see about getting a straight answer. - Roy. - I got the address. It's right here. Wait just a minute. You got... 2341 Royale. How did you get that address? You can't just call here at this hour of the night. Your wife know about the gambling? Hmm? My wife? What are you talking about? She know how deep in you are with Ptitko, you degenerate prick? I'll come pay you a fucking visit. Oh! It's okay. It's okay. Hi, there. Hi. Good dive. Thank you. - What's your name? - Rocky. You on vacation? Mm-hmm. Where y'all coming from? We's from Orange, Texas. Your Uncle John from there, too? I got it, baby. No. I think watching a game in the dark, you lose all sense of time, so to speak. Well, they always use the backup system anyways. The stopwatches down in the timekeeper's tent just in case something does happen during the course of the period. What we'll probably see... And just use the stopwatch... You can do it so good! I can do it myself. You can. No, no, nothing like that. Just... Just leaving Galveston, remembered you were close. No, I-I was on a welding job out on... on a rig. It's over now. No, I don't... I don't want nothing. Loraine, Loraine. What do you want? Talk, catch up a little. Just passing through. I told you I was busy. Okay, just for a minute, though. But you come inside here. I don't want you out front. Seems you changed your mind about marriage. Well, when you meet the right man... What are you doing here? Well, like I said, I was just passing through, and I-I... and I was... curious to hear how you been. Been? Been since when, 11 years ago? Yeah. The last 11 years have been absolutely wonderful. There. You know, you're not as handsome as I used to think. Yeah, I actually get that a lot. You're drunk. You really can't stick around. I am busy. Well, I'm not staying. I'm going, leaving town. I was just... You remember when we went to Galveston? You remember that week when you... you told me about your sister and your dad. Remember? I was remembering that we were drunk on mojitos before noon, and we were just scarfing crabmeat. And we cou... we couldn't get the smell off. We were showering off, and it... it rained, and we went inside, just stayed inside. Just two days, just, you know, fuckin'. Mm-hmm. I'm a dynamite piece of ass. - Yes, you are. - Hmm. Thank you, Roy. I can't do this all day with you. I'm just leaving t-the country, and I was thinking, uh... We... We... I... We... I believe we had good times. I was glad when you went to prison. Look, the past isn't real. You... You remember it how you want to remember it. You'd sober up for a week, and then you'd start talking about how things are gonna be different, and then you'd be drunk for three weeks straight. You made it so that I couldn't be around you without being shit-faced. And you threw me around a little. You remember that? What'd you ever like about me, then? I don't remember. There haven't been many like you for me. You see this here? It sends an alarm to all those Hallivan boys that patrol the neighborhood. I was just saying goodbye. Sure you were. I'm dying. Aren't we all? Do you think I look pretty? It'll only be for a few hours tonight. I'll have money for you tomorrow. Well, we really do enjoy her. What are you up to? How you bringing money back when you haven't had any here? Well, I got a job today at this restaurant on the strip. I'm a hostess at Scarpetto's. I get a tip-out. Yeah, right. Good for you. We'll take care of her. Of course we will. Thank you. You're just drunk, baby. Hello! Hello! Hello! Hey. Do you know where, uh... You know, normally I let folks keep to themselves, but after what happened here, that man murdering his wife, I got to know what's going on. That gal of yours, she had men in her room twice since you left. She's been putting that little baby off on Dee and Nonie, and I believe there was some confusion as to whether you would be back. Of course I would. I paid up. How's the kid? She deserves better than this. You know, I don't know if you're that gal's pimp or not, but you look like hell, and you smell like it, too. Normally, I'd have had you tossed out of here, called the sheriff's, but that little one, she don't need to be put in no system. However bad you think she has it, where she's coming from was worse. Now, her sister's just a girl I helped out, bad spot. Look, I didn't know her till a few days back. - She wanted a ride to Texas. - Who are you? I'm just a guy who tried to help out a couple people, and it's brought me here. Listen, they're not my problem. I'll call the sheriff myself, tell him some hitchhiking tramp dropped her kid off on me. I don't think you're gonna call any sheriff and say anything, but I do think if you were gonna leave those girls, you would've. - Ice cream cone. - Ice cream cone? I'm looking for the girl. You seen her? Saw you leave. Saw you toss the paper, dug it out the trash. I's just reading along, realized, hey, them girls in that article got the same name as these girls here. One plus one, you know? Ain't none of my business, man. I ain't got no desire to screw you over or nothing. I'm just saying, you know, if it come to that. Come to what? Listen, if I don't have a partner for that score, I could get busted. Cops come down on me hard, I could break easy. But I could say, "Listen, y'all lend me some grace, and I can give you a murder. I can tell you something about some missing girls." I ain't a rat. I'm just... I'm just saying. Let's make some money, man, you know? Just come check out the place with me. I'll lay it all out for you, and you'll see I'm a pro, man. I'm a pro. All right. I want to wait till dark, though. People around here probably shouldn't see us hanging out, so meet me in the parking lot down by the Zippy Trip, 8:00. You're paranoid, brah. Ain't nobody here gonna know anything.

That woman talking about calling social services, saying some whore abandoned her sister. You fucking killed someone! - You killed someone. - We are not the same. Yes, we are. Roy, you okay? You okay? Roy? Roy? Roy, should I call a doctor? Roy. Roy, back in Orange... I don't doubt he deserved it. I mean, she's not your sister, is she? No. You want... want to tell me about him? My mom wasn't around, and so it was just Gary and I. And he moved the... t-the TV in my room for me. And he was drinking whiskey. So he sat in my room with me... ...watching the TV. And then he... And I left her. I left her. I left her. I-I left her. I left her with him. Well... It's all right. Forget it. That's over now. I'm gonna square with Nancy. We can't stay here no more. Roy. Don't leave us. I won't. Okay. - Surprise, surprise! - Damn, Roy. I wondered if we'd hear from you again. That was some show you put on. Cost me three good men. I was actually impressed. Yeah, well, I got something. Cargo manifests, your name everywhere. And real long, real detailed letter explaining the whole operation. - On my eyes... - On your eyes, then, you carpetbagging Polack motherfucker! This is what your boys were after? - Yeah? Well, I got it. - What you want? 75K deposited. It's a bargain. I think it's a bit much. Copies go out. Times-Picayune. Baton Rouge. Originals to the feds. "Ptitko," it says, nearly every page. "Ptitko, Ptitko, Ptitko, Ptitko, Ptitko." Get a pen 'cause I'm about to hang up. What assurances do I have? Guess you're gonna have to reckon my word's a little better than yours. This buys me out. I'm done. Appreciate how y'all have taken to the little one. She's very special. May be the case they end up sticking around after I leave. They need people to be nice to them. That little one needs people looking out for her. What do you mean? I mean, if I wasn't around and the little one needed something, I know you'd look after her. You want to try? Well, I just figured I could take you out tonight and get dinner or something. Sure. Sounds good. All right. All right. Well, I'll pick you up at 5:00? All right. Yeah. Don't... Don't get too excited, but I got something going on that could help you out a little bit, get you some... some money. You take yourself a high-school-degree test. I'm serious. You... You take yourself a high-school-degree test. You help... Y-You hire somebody to help you out with the little one, and... and you go to school for something. For what? Learn to do something. You're quick. You do it for yourself. You do it for her. You just do it.

Mr. Cady, I am speaking to you now as outside counsel for an unnamed party concerned with your recent felonies. Assault, theft, homicide. Quite a list of charges, Mr. Cady. Though I understand you intend to indict other persons to avoid serving time. in other words, you're planning to make it easy on yourself by informing on my client. Naturally, my client's defense would include a body of witnesses to cross-examine, such as Nancy Covington, owner of the Emerald Shores Motel in Galveston, Texas. And a young child, 3-year-old girl. Name I have here is Tiffany Benoit, currently residing with Nonie and Dehra Ellison at 540 Briarwood Lane, Round Rock, Texas. That's correct, isn't it? Well, there's no need to involve them, of course, if you just serve your time quietly and leave my client out of it. Now, including this information, this storm is becoming quite large. This is gonna be a major hurricane. Could be a Category 3 or a 4 by landfall. Truly massive storm, appears to be. But right now, as you can see, it really seems to be splitting the difference on the Hurricane Center. Most likely to make landfall on the Gulf Coast of Texas, hitting somewhere between Corpus Christi and Galveston. This is taking up around a half of the Gulf of Mexico. This storm could be more Allen-like in power. You just can't say, but we've really got to listen to what the mayor and county judge said. When you're dealing with a storm of this size, really, Category 4 hurricane... ...storm surges 13 to 18 feet, winds 131 to 155 miles per hour. Hi. I'm looking for Roy. Don't take this storm for granted. We are dealing with... How did you find me? Oh, it was the lady from the hotel a long time ago. She, uh, said your real name was Roy. I hired a man who found your prison records and photos. Took him a while, though. You don't look the same. It's 20 years ago. Where do you live? Austin. What do you do there? Uh, I do graphic design and advertisement stuff, but I'm an artist, too. You married? Not yet. Maybe soon. You in love? - Yeah. - Yeah. That's good, that you're in love. Yeah. He's the one who encouraged me to... I'm sorry. I spent a lot of time and money to find you, and I have questions. Uh, how much do you... how much do you know? I remember my sister. A little. I remember us going to the beach. But then, one day, she just left me. No, uh, wasn't like that. We... We were going out for the night, and we were coming right back for you. But then you were in New Orleans. - You were in prison? - Yeah, uh, I was in a... a car accident and... ...got banged up. And there was a warrant out on me. I don't... I don't understand what happened after you both left me. Why won't you answer me? Stop putting me off. Stop lying to me. I just... I need to know. Please. You know, all this... All this time, uh, I was your friend. I'll tell you everything that happened. But I-I got a condition. Uh, there's a... there's a storm coming, and you got to get out of town. What about you? Let's go now. - You can come with me. - No. No. I'll talk to you now. And if I talk, you leave. That's the deal. Deal. That other little girl in the picture... ...uh, she isn't your sister. She's your mother. Don't blame her. She had a hard life. But she did a brave thing once. She didn't leave you. You weren't abandoned. Never abandoned.
