F. He's an asshole. Excuse me let it pass, please. His pulse is weak, we will soon. Can you hear me? Answer me! Translation / Legend / Sync "Edd_br" Review "Scarecrow" I was instantly attracted to him. His music really got me. When I heard on the radio for the first time I could not believe it was the singer Switzerland in a band! When I saw him, just hit me: fogies was a star. I had never seen anyone like him. And as to imagine that one day would be as close to him. For. Reto, you're out. What is wrong? - This guy gives me chills. - It's a matter of taste. Is this your problem: bad taste. And Van Morrison? Between Van Morrison and Neil Diamond has a world of difference. There is no way to compare the two. Instead of reading magazines teens should smoke a joint. Sch?fer. Let me out! Instead of messing up all could help me. Could wind the cables for example. And I was not all that to wind the cables. But even so they took me for the show in Basle as a helper. Someone brought something to drink? You do not have anything to drink? No way! It's so hot... and has nothing to drink! - This is to be a joke? - What, your hat? - Well, it's cute. - Style Marc Bolan, right? It is more like the Queen of England. Wade, music! I have to rewind the tape first. Wait, you better grab this tape. It is the CCR, the more American pop trash. Not American pop! Hey, give this tape to me. You realize as is late? - 3:15 - From the dawn. Where were you? - In Basle. - In Basle? Kidding me? I have to believe it? You're living under my roof. So I have a right to know. Where did you spend the whole night. - Anything else? - You bet! I did not sleep one second so far. Fritz went away because it was full my concerns with you. And you think normal exit and return quietly at 3 am? Fritz is your friend, not mine. I do not give a damn about the crap of his boat. We're better off without him. And it's no good for you. I jumped out too. Got it? So now you want to go? May I ask where? And that's going to live? Dear fogies... Do not know if you know my name. I've been helping behind the scenes his show in Basle. I did not dare speak to you, but now I tell escrevendo.Tenho The Minks followed for a long time. I've seen almost all his concerts. You are an amazing singer. But I'm not a fan either. I admire you not only because he is famous. You create your music without caring what others think. I heard you're gay, but I do not care. I love you. Beni. One moment. For you, someone called fogies. Is open! - Did I wake you? - Yes. - Sorry. - Okay. - Always wake up so early? - No. It was just today. Left a cigarette? Listen, I'm completely stoned. Lie here if you want. Can I get one? Still did not smoke at your age. And yes it was a good boy. - Just started smoking... - Okay. I was just kidding. I really enjoyed your letter. Really? Never thought I'd call me. - Why not call? - You have so many fans. - But they are not like you. - Why? You said it in his letter. You're beautiful! I have to go to the bathroom. Left. - Are you okay? - Half dizzy. It is the breath. Sei. Oxygen pro your brain too. As you breathe fode as an ox. - Must be because I love you... - Really? Do not laugh. Seriously. Yes, Beni... I know. He does not understand. Listen The Lords Melanie, Neil Diamond and other bullshit. - You liked the Lords. - A long time ago. - Not too long ago. - For me it does. Based and have not even smoked beat the required jacking off every night. When I heard that shit yet. This problem is straight, it stuck there and not notice. Since I met you, I realized several things. You can turn the stuff? Oh, sorry. Hello, Tobe. Working out? And the van? Ritch's brother will lend us. Well .. go to the kitchen. What's his problem? One for fogies. Unzinho to Tobe and one for Beni. What is it? Are these trips? Why not tell me anything? I am also interested in this. Is it? Have used one? No, Beni, not yet. Why did not taste one? No, not today. - Why not? - Because... Because of what? Because... not now. - But I've never tasted one. - Leave it! I said not now, ok? He heard about The Alligators? They almost managed to open Eric Burdon's tour in Germany. Yeah, we know all that. It's because they have a manager. and he takes off the best. Let him. So where is the problem? Really. It is an unnecessary paranoia. What is the meaning of this? Music is business. What else? We will not spend my life asking for the car loan for my brother. One day he will say: "It's over, boys drop, discharge and fall off! - And there we'll look like fools. - Here, instead having a drink. No thanks. I do not need. - Come on! - No. Why not? Why can not I play when I'm drunk. The Alligators only play... when they are completely drunk. This is their secret. C'mon! This will help you... keep things in perspective. Shit! Look. you messed me around. What a jerk! You think it's funny, is not it? # I'm waiting for my man # $ 26 in my hand # Up to Lexington, 125 # Feel sick and dirty, more dead than alive # I'm waiting for my man Got a cigarette? Fire? # Hey, white boy, what you doin 'uptown? # Hey, white boy, you chasin 'our women? # Oh pardon me sir, this is as far as possible # I'm just waiting for a baby my dear friend # I'm waiting for my man # Here it comes, all dressed in black You saw the movie pods with the giants? "Body Snatchers". * Invasion of the Body Snatchers - 1956 * They devour their identity, their emotions. No, not so. You get the virus shortly after birth. Then grows very slowly. depending on the person After a 30 is dangerous. At 40 it's over. 40 guys are like the desert. No emotions only continue producing. Without kindness. heartless... Nothing but sacrifice. A life full of sacrifices. - What about women? - Same thing. With few exceptions, but for these invented Valium. - What about me? - You? You kick the bucket before. Not sleeping? Come! Hey... Tobe! What is it? You saw the Beni? What? Beni? I do not know where he is. Come, let's go. - Now? - Yes. He is not here? He returns. It's all right. Tob. Go to bed. I'm completely exhausted. It's okay if I sleep here? Sure. Grab a blanket. Ah... there you are. Sorry. Where were you? I got a ride, but I got stuck in Baden. And I had to wait for the first train. Come to bed. You still love me? Of course I still love you. You know, I'm not like you, fogies. I will not be jealous, but does not stand to see you with him. I was scared And is no longer scared now? Agreed? Is everything okay? In winter, things do not go The Minks to as well. Ritch was right. It's hard without a manager. Fogies but wanted to remain independent. So he turned to dealing drugs. And went to Lebanon to buy cheap hashish. Hello, Beni. Cool, man. Long time here? We're up there. I just arrived. - Well? Got news of fogies? - Yes, he sent me a card. What worries you? Freaked out since he left. Oh, come on! He'll be only two weeks away. I know... But I feel like a whore miss him. I worry that something might happen to him, getting caught or something. Do not worry, he is very smart about it. Will never catch him. Hey, Beni - Arrived! Fogies not sent you any previews yet? Hello, Ritch. Beni is not legal if wants to avoid a double suicide, leave us alone. It has a lighter? It's cold, no? Did not see you at the Odeon? Yes, I was there. You just stared at me. It's true. You were there yesterday too, did not seem quite right. - And I saw you twice this week. - Can. I've been noticing you for a long time. I even dreamed about you. Want a beer? - I just want to go home. - Only one beer. Or whatever you prefer. Hello, Beni. How's life? I was totally stoned. All I wanted was to go home. Then he started talking to me, and then went with him. He gave me 50 francs. - Are you angry? - No. I can not stand when he is not here. I can not live without you. If it takes a little longer, I do not know what I would have done. What? - I understand. You're mad. - I'm not. You know, in Beirut... I was not too much. Why? I realized I was older. Are you crazy? You're not old at all. I realize that this is not can last longer. Say it once and which is already full of myself. I know. I am not interesting enough for you. but I'll do anything for you. Stand up for you guys. Stop madness. It has nothing to do with you. You know that there stand old people, these walking corpses. Preferred by an end to it before. You want to commit suicide, is it? If I do the same with me too. Go, Beni, lighten up. I bought orange soda. and cigarettes... I bought this as well. And new and very practical. Just have to put in the oven. What oven? If there is no will, Ritch, then just say so. Tell me what to play. I have no idea what I play. Tell me. I do not know what you want. Do not know what I want? It's a shame. We played together for so long. So what you want? At least know what you want? Come, let us know. Must be a reason for being here. Or have nothing better to do. Failed anyone to climb today? Enough fogies, this will get us nowhere. I just want to know. You're unfair. So is this? Want me to rub your back? Ritch thinks will come out? You were a little rude to him, but did the right thing. He's kind of slow lately. Really? Yes, I mean, you were not... Lebanon to make all that money to continue the same thing. Please Beni, stop talking bullshit and leave me alone. Why, that was I said now? We need to return to the stage, giving concerts. Certainly the inspiration again. - Leave us alone. - Then I'll play Pinball. We are a band to play live. You always say that. People love our music. And now we are full... To hell with people. Forget, Tobe. You can see that there no sense in it. Why insist on something that have died? - When did the relapse? - It has nothing to do with it. - Are you sure? - Do not mess with it. I'm just full. You do not love me anymore. Is that not love me anymore. Leave me alone! Failing to do so. Please... Say something. Whatever I do? Will you stop that! Stop! Ok? Go, get out! Leave me alone! You want coffee? Neither do I. Get out. Beni is annoying me. But I did nothing. You can not stand crawling around like a slave. We both had only an adventure! Now get outta here! I sold two grams? Got something? Can I exchange hash for this? 100 francs and a piece? Even when you think of dog play? Come on! I said, eat! - I wanted one more. - You can ask for. And talk to him bring me a beer... and cigarettes. Hello, Beni, how are you? You have a little time? - No, I'm here with a friend. - A friend... - Who is that? - Wirsling. Sei. - We left when you were out. - And what he wanted? He asked if I had time. Hi! Am fogies, a friend of Beni. - Can I sit? - At ease. Beni said a psychiatrist. This should be interesting. Could be. That sounds attractive. - The methods have changed a bit lately. - Is it true? - Never heard of Psychiatry Soft? - No, but should be good. This means that you're stuck without pain? Listen, fogies. far from my profession is the monstrosity that seems to think. Sorry, it's nothing personal. Anyway, I'm not hurry to visit their premises. Well, I'm doing a service. Do not want to stay company of this gentleman? - You do not care, no? - That is, Beni to decide. In two hours at the Odeon. - Let me... - No, it's on me. This is a bit... I mean, need not stay if you want. No, it's all right. Drink anything? Who is this piece? Wait, wait. Here! Fast, faster! Go and catch! Picks, picks! Tag! Go! I told you not in bed! Come down! Come on. Come, now! If you are good you can get it. But only if it is good. Let's see how good dog you are. So, so. Here, good dog. You want it? Easy. Good dog. Fogies cared for... I maintain relationships rich men. Made me walk the streets and cared for me. At that time was all over with The Minks. Fogies but did not care, I won enough money for both of us. The architect called, You have an appointment for tomorrow. Have you been swimming? How many rounds did you give? Dec. You must give 15. Develop your muscles. I will be in another room. Sometimes I do not say a word all day not to be "yes" and "no." And I felt a new happiness by not be responsible for anything more. There were more words in my head, only eyes, a mouth and the dream of a sleeping dog. Must be Wirslng. But you'll stay here tonight. No, I need to go. There is also a physical force. You see? The almost erotic expression this painting. This of course was a challenge conservative style of art and the Mannerist period. As an image frozen in a movie. What? Not feeling well? It's vodka. Come, lie down a little. You're not eating? No, I'm not hungry. - What, Beni? - Nothing, I'm cool. Who is using drugs? Heroin? Stop it, Bruno! I've said I'm fine. I used an acid and had a bad trip, just this. That guy is... hurting you... It's what I think. Watch... I made a proposal, which still stands. Can I give you an apartment. You can work in Robert Gallery when you want. Gotta leave he touch me too? This was nasty, Beni. Are you, Beni? Poor Tob. Forget completely and not care about him. He said that was the thing The Minks most important of his life. Now we come what he meant. He left me a letter. You see, he did it. He did this for real, you understand? What do we do now? We have to call someone. I did not know he would go so far. I was not sad for real, but who was always confused as around and suddenly was gone. And I felt guilty because fogies Tobe had left because of me. I got a job as a model. All those old gay weird and started to annoy me. So I tried something more serious. Well .. seriously... Hello, Mr. Schafter. When? 7 pm? Should I wear any special clothing? Okay. Even more. I did not hear you arrive. He saw my dose? I put here this morning. - I caught. - What? Are you crazy? Why took... my drug? What do you mean by "my" Drug? I paid for it. You make me a joint? Do it yourself. I have a service to do. Beni, brought me a beer? Hurry, I'm thirsty! Would you mind bring me a beer? Thanks... See, that's how it's done. I saw Reto today. He asked me what he was doing. What should I tell him? Do you even remember Reto? My classmate. I had a wonderful day. Sch?fer gave me a nice blowjob. What do you care? Mick Jagger is dead. What? They spoke on TV. You are screwing with my head? Poor useless. Look at you! It gives me grief. Note how you fell down? But do not give a damn, no? What? Back off if you do not suit you. And what will become of you? Did not ask you shit! Fuck you! Get lost. I asked you to do the cleaning? You can not caring for yourself. Not able to take care of itself. You are not capable of anything! Look at this place! It stinks, sick! Is disgusting and stinks! Stay calm! Just look at you! Stop it! Go and break all you have here. Fuck! Where to put "The Beggars Banquet," the Stones? Shit... Come, have a drink with me. I'm going. Sit, Beni. Sit, I said. I said, sit! - Beni, you're too kind. - Okay. No, you're a nice guy really. I love you too, you know? You know? I love you more than any other person. I'm so sorry. I can understand that not love me anymore. But I still love you. I hurt too much. It's okay. All I want is to stay with you. Hell all the rest. I hurt so much. We knew that nothing was left in to do but to leave Zurich. She knew that to fogies... would not just leave. He never intended to return to Switzerland. - Let's go swimming together? - I am determined to play a little. - Ok then that I, even more. - Bye. - If you bother to stay here. - Oh, no. It was amazing. I swear. I read in a newspaper article... that in 2004 a meteorite on Earth will explode. All life will be decimated. We're no longer here. A scientist who has researched this. So all must end. They talk about it as a reality? Yes, because... There is a tremendous force behind it. In this case... we have to enjoy life more. Need not talk about it. Knew what was going on in your head. He had already decided. And so he was so calm, relaxed and happy. But I was afraid to die. Well, Let? You think it's enough? Yes, the thing is first. Wait, hold the spoon a little louder. In that way. If I was not so afraid of needles... Give me. No need to fear. You have great veins. I have to pee. Close the fist. How? Yes, that way. Please let me pass. His pulse is weak, let's go. Fogies failed, but somehow I safei. Maybe because they did not want to die or because he was younger, healthier. Maybe fogies me a smaller amount. I do not know. I felt very tired. How had not slept for 100 years. I thought it could never recover any lost sleep. But this fatigue was also a relief. Maybe it was the drugs they gave me in the hospital: I also felt light and empty. And there was this empty sadness but also comfort. And of course I asked myself many, many times, and still wonder. If he had loved even more, and another way, he would not have died. If we cross paths again, fogies, try even stronger: love you so that nothing can separate us. Next time I'll be strong. I swear, next time... # I was a wing in heaven blue # Gliding over the ocean # Gliding over Spain # And I was free # Do not need anybody # And it was beautiful # And it was beautiful # I was a pawn # There was a movement # There was no place # That I could go # But I was free # Do not need anybody # And it was beautiful # And it was beautiful # And if there's one thing # That could do for you # You'd be a wing # In the blue sky # I was a vision # Of other eye # And they saw nothing # No future, nothing # Still, I was free # Do not need anybody # And it was beautiful # And it was beautiful # And if there's one thing # That could do for you # You'd be a wing # In the blue sky
