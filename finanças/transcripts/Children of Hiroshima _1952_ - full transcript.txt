Have a good holiday, but don't forget to study. See you back in September. Goodbye, Sir! Are you going to camp? I'm going to Hiroshima. Is that your hometown? Must be nice to have a hometown. I was born on the island. No hometown to go back to. You're lucky to be born here. Good afternoon! Hello there. I'm back. Hello. You're early. Let me help you. You'd better prepare for tomorrow. It won't take me long. I'll just go like this. Will you take the morning or afternoon ferry? The early one. That's a good idea. You'll be in Hiroshima before sunset. I'll get your ticket for you. - Thank you. - Not at all. Did you eat your lunch? Don't be getting on the boat! I won't! Naughty boy! I'll do it. How long since you've been back? I haven't been back once since then. Four years. Time certainly flies. I don't like to recall the past but sometimes I can't help it. I've for gotten it. Well, you haven't changed at all. You're always so cheerful. Thanks to you. You've made me one of the family. Where will you stay there? With Morikawa who I taught with. Remember that your family grave is here, on the island. This is your home now. Hurry back. We'll be waiting. Thank you, I shall. Miss Ishikawa! Where are you going? To Hiroshima. Back home, eh? Where was your house? Near the old prefectual office. Better to lay those memories to rest. This is Hiroshima. Where the world's fl'rst A -bomb vl'ctlms dled on August 6, 1945. Her beautl'ful rlvers still flow just as they did that fateful day. Her beautlful sky is just as big as It was that fateful day. The children of that day are now grown. And the devastated cl'ty rebullt. Father... Mother... Haru... It's me, Takako. Get a move on, Haru. It's already 8. Will you be home late? No, I'll be early today. I'm going. You be careful. And pay attention to the air-raid sirens. And you, too. I'm off. HI'roshima Central Military HQ reports that the air-rald warnlng is canceled as of 8 o'clock. What's up? I forgot... This, right? Thank you. You're always in a rush. A man who was sittl'ng thlnklng on these steps was I'nstantly vaporized by the exploslon. But hl's thoughts llve on. Show charity, Miss. Help a poor blind man. Is that you, lwa-san? It is you, isn't it. It's me, Takako. Do you remember me? It has to be you. I'm Takako. Miss Ishikawa... Please go away. I'm so ashamed. I'm a beggar now. Go away, please. With my blindness I couldn't work. Look what's become of me. You're totally blind? I can see a little. You have a place to live? Not what you'd call a house. But better than nothing. Can I stay there tonight? Never! It's not fit for the likes of you, Miss. Not at all. It's been so long, I want to talk with you. Come on. Please don't Miss, I beg you. Let's go. That's it. You're late today, Iwa-san. I've brought a guest. I've already prepared your supper. I'm sorry. Wait, I'll set a light. Please come in. It's not much but make yourself at home. May I sit here? I'm sorry it's so dirty. Please sit on this. This is where I live. It's not so bad. I'm ashamed to offer you such food. You shouldn't be. Can I help? I won't hear of it. I'm quite capable. Please sit down. Here's a little side-dish too. Welcome. Who's your guest? The daughter of my former boss. The young mistress? Excuse me. She's ver y nice. She's a rag-picker. She looks after me. It's good of her. I heard you went to live with your uncle. Is everyone well? Yes, they're all fine. What became of your son, Koji? They sent me his remains. And his wife? A victim of the A-bomb. Wasn't there a baby? What about him? Did he survive? Yes. He's alive. That's great. He must be 7 by now. Where is he? In an orphanage. But why? I can take care of myself but not Taro, too. So I asked them to look after him. We're all in the hands of fate. If I had my sight back I could, though. If it wasn't for the A-bomb none of this would've happened. 'The A -bomb killed my mother. 'Daddy dl'ed In battle. 'Only Grandad and I were left. 'Grandad was bllnded by the A -bomb. 'So now he can't work. 'I vlslt my parent's graves every August 6. ' Almost all of them are war orphans. In one instant almost 200,000 died. And many children were orphaned. According to 1948 statistics we have more orphans than Tokyo or Osaka though both are far larger than Hiroshima. That's Taro. The smallest one moving stones. We're funded by local and national government. We get 13 c$ per child per day and food costs 9 c$ . We tried farming that field over there. But half an acre isn't much. But the children are well. I plan to start some kind of work with them How many orphans are there in Hiroshima now? Many have died from radiation. And some have been transferred. But we have about 500-600 in 6 Hiroshima facilities. But many are not institutionalized. With careful research we could account for them. The older ones have accepted their losses. But the younger ones still pine. Taro seems healthy. I'm pleased to hear that. Iwakichi-san... Can I take Taro back to the island? My uncle's family will take care of him. I'll be his guardian. Can I take him? I couldn't do that. I'd lose all reason to live. But it would be best for Taro. I appreciate your concern. But he's all I have now. I can't live without the boy. He's all that keeps me alive. Then you could come, too. No, it sounds good but it just wouldn't work. Please do it. I can't. I just can't. Iwa-san! Please, Iwa-san! Eat it while it's cold. I'm ever so glad to see you. I've nowhere else to stay except with you. Please eat. I feel so bad for Iwa-san. The poor man. He served us well so many years. I wish I could help him. Back already? Hello. Hot, isn't 'lt? We have a guest. Pleased to meet you. Miss Ishikawa. We taught together. Please make yourself at home. Should I draw your bath, dear? Excuse me. Have you eaten, dear? No, I'm starving. We've finished ours. A good man. Too easy-going, and he earns a pittance. He's really not very smart. That's why I work as a midwife. Where does he work? In the sanitary department. Quite proud of it, too. How's the bath, dear? I'm almost done. If you'll excuse me a moment. Take your time. Sorry it's so noisy. It's always like this. The Bon festival heralds summer, though. Hioshima's emotions left wth the A-bomb. Here's a treat. I'll have it when I get back. Are you going to play chess? Not at the same place. Kuraishi says we can have their last child. It's their 5th one, and hard on them. Will they really give it to us? We're adopting a baby. She can't bear children. It's too early to tell. No, the doctor said it's impossible. The A-bomb made me sterile. I'd better go see about the baby. Yes, the sooner the better. I'll just have a quick cup of tea. That's enough. I'm off. Make yourself at home. Take care. He's a bit short-tempered, just like a child. When did you know you were sterile? 2 years ago. I was desperate but I got over 'lt. I'm lucky, at least I survived. That's the only consolation. The doctor said I'm a rare example. 3 children from the kinder garten survived, right? I must see them. Do you know where they are? Yes, and they're all well. I have photos of them. This album was all I could salvage. Remember these three? Yes, Sanpei, Toshiko and He'lta. It's wonderful that you remember. Don't forget I was with them every day. That was such a wonderful time. I can never for get them. I'll go visit the survivors, then. I wish I could too. Please give them my love. I'll go see Sanpei first. Sanpei, Daddy's dying. Hurry! What's wrong? Did you tell Mom? Not yet. Go tell her now. Mummy! PEACE MEMORIAL HALL Mummy! What? I'm busy! Dad's dying! How is he? Bad. Better call a doctor. How is he? He's slipping away. Daddy! Hayakichi-san! Bear up! Daddy, here's water. Sanpei, where are you? I'm here, Daddy. The doctor's here. His gums started bleeding 10 days ago. He completely lost his appetite. The doctor doesn't know what it is. Must be radiation sickness. You never know when it'll appear. He's really gone. How tragic. It's so terrible. Go and get Uncle. Sanpei. You remember me? Yes, I do. And you are? I used to teach Sanpei in kindergarten. My sincerest condolences. Sympathy is all very well but it's no use to the dead. Why did you die! I'm looking for an old pupil, called Toshiko. I taught her in kindergarten. Welcome. You're just in time. Please see her. She could die any time. It's so sudden we suspect radiation poisoning. You really came at a good time. She's in here. Teacher. You still remember me. I didn't at first but it came to me. Have you lived here all this time? Yes, for 6 years. The priest saved me the day of the bomb. I've been here ever since. Your mother and father? Everyone was killed. And I decided to stay here. Here I can say prayers for them. I ask God to grant us peace forever. That is a very good thing to do. Now I understand that war is the greatest evil. War is hell. Will you sing for me? Sing what? The one you always sang at lunch. About the red ship. You remember very well. I want to hear it just once more. Alright then. Dear mother, go to sleep and don 't cry. Father will come home tomorrow I'n a red boat. Is it nice on your island? Beautiful. I wish you could visit me. The sun rises out of the eastern sea and sets in the west. I'd love to, but I don't think I will. I'm going to die. But I don't mind because I'll go and join my mother and father. I was glad to see them but I feel so bad. The A-bomb brought on so many tragedies that spread like ripples. It's so terrible. They'll use it again, I'm afraid. I still have glass here. It's hard when I touch it. But I'II leave it there in remembrance of August 6. The baby is on its way. Please come at once. She's in labor. Hurry please, I'll get your bicycle. I'll be back soon. Since I can't have one I help others have babies. Please, hurry! I'm coming. Don't wait up for me. Good luck. Is Heita around? I dunno. Do you know where Heita Masuda is? Yes. Hey, Heita! What? Someone's looking for you. Remember me? Yeah, my teacher. You look well. I went to your house. No one's home. My sister's at the hairdresser's. She's getting married. Shut your mouth! Come home with me. Of course. Just let me swim a little more. Be careful. It's okay. You've grown, Miss. So have you. Yes, I'm 12. That's my house. I'm home. Have you been swimming all this time? I brought my old teacher here. Your old teacher? From kinder garten, see. Hello. His teacher! Thank you for coming, it's been so long. Yes, I came to see Heita. She's getting married tonight. Don't be silly! Congratulations. Don't say that. Please come inside. Yes, come inside. Please, come in. Please sit down. I'm so happy to see you. My oldest brother will be home soon. My oldest brother works in a factory. The next oldest's in high school. Mum and Dad were killed by the A-bomb. Sis was trapped when the house fell on her. She hurt her leg. Please. Thank you but I'll leave in a minute. You can stay the night. Yes, please do. I couldn't. My brother will be so pleased. He'll be back soon. Heita, go buy some fish. Buy some sashimi? I'll go now. You mustn't leave. He seems very happy to see you. I'm pleased he's so healthy. He's grown. I'm home. My brother's back. Hello. What's up? You've got to get ready. It's Heita's kinder garten teacher. She's checking on him. I'm his brother, thank you for coming. My sister's marrying today. Best day since the war ended. Your visit must be fate. Please celebrate with us. I'm going for a bath. Want to join me? We haven't a bath so we go to the public baths. Let's bathe, then relax. Let's go. She's coming too. Get her a towel. It's over the river. I'm so pleased about her marriage to Tanaka. He'd promised to marry her once the war was over. But after the accident crippled her leg she gave up all hopes of marriage. She thought he'd never marry her. I'm happy for her. Tanaka was repatriated in 1946 and he came to see us soon after. He said he'd marry her anyway. I was so moved by him. I felt happy just to be alive. The world is not all bad. You can still trust some people. But he wanted to wait for 5 years. All his property had been destroyed. He wanted to get himself set up again. The 5 years ended today. It really is wonderful. Yes, it is. It really is. Father and Mother will be so happy. Let's have a last toast. Thank you. Shall we go? I've been such a burden on you. Take care of yourself. Look after yourself, Yoshio. Yes, you too. Mind what they tell you, Heita. Father, Mother, I take my leave. Let's go. Good luck! Thank you. You take care, Heita. Take care of Heita. Come on now. Let's walk part of the way. My sister! I'll stay tonight, I want to talk to you. Iwakichi-san. Before I return to the island I wanted to know if you've changed your mind. Let me take care of Taro. My uncle and aunt have only one child. They'll bring him up as their own. It's the best way for Taro. Should you wish, you can come, too. I wept when I first heard your kind words. You served us well, it's only natural. I beg you not to take him. I can't live without him. Please don't make me. I shan't force you. I understand how you feel. I'll say no more. Please forgive me. Please for give my brashness. Please feel free to write if you should change your mind. And you take care of yourself. You too, miss. Sayonara. Are you going straight home? I'll take the morning ferry back. Please don't tell your uncle of my circumstances. No. Goodbye. I heard all about it. It moved me to tears. She's a real lady. I understand how painful 'lt is for you. But think of how good it would be for Taro. How can you continue living like this? You can't even have the boy with you. I'm a begger and you? You're a rag-picker! I'll live with Taro no matter what they say! You can't understand how I feel. I surely can. I had a daughter and a grandson. Don't say any more. Please think it over. How long d'you expect to live? The A-bomb has made you weak. You could die at any time. Then what will Taro do? Think it over. A man can't live forever. I won't die so easily. I want all to see this face. I know how you feel but our lives are finite. Father, mother, I shall return. Iwakichi has changed his mind. Please take Taro with you. I'll get him from the orphanage. You go to his shack. I'm glad you reconsidered. I won't complain any more. Please, take care of him. I'm back. Taro, come 'ln. Grandfather? I want to talk to you. Sit yourself down. She is the daughter of my old employer. Pay your respects to her. Good afternoon. She lives on an island in a beautiful house. Would you like to live there, too? Why don't you come with me? Is Grandad going too? I'll follow later on. First you go. That's best, Taro. You can ride on the boat with me. Go, Taro. I don't want to go without Grandad. I'll come soon after. I won't go unless Grandad comes too. Taro! Taro, you go first and Grandad will follow. It's a lie! Good boys do as they're told. Go with her. No, I won't. You refuse? I want to know. What'll you do? Don't send me away. I'll do anything. Don't cry. I won't send you away. I'll be back, Iwakichi. Where will you stay tonight? At my friend's house. Where's that? R'lght behind the courthouse. I'm sorry for the trouble. Goodbye, Taro. Goodbye, Madam. I'm so sorry. Please help me. Please, would you write a letter for me please? Why did you buy me such good shoes? Because you've studied hard. Aren't they nice? I wanted shoes so much. Now we'll have some dinner. What kind of fish is this? I don't know. Anyway, let's eat. It's been so long since we've eaten together. Let's have a feast. How is it? Careful with the bones. You want more rice? Yes, I'll serve myself. Eat your fill, we've plenty of rice. Do you share a bed at the orphanage? No, I sleep alone. Do you ever get lonely? No, never. You're a good boy, Taro. What would you do should I die? You won't die. I'm done. Had enough to eat? Yes. I love these shoes. Still got them on? I'll sleep with them. Taro, will you run an errand for me? Where to? The lady who was here today. I'll do it tomorrow. She's leav'lng tomorrow so it must go tonight. How do I get there? Easy, once you're at the courthouse it's very close by. Ask for Morikawa's house. I may get lost. Please do it for me. Can I wear these shoes? Of course you can. Here's the letter. I'll go now. Don't forget, Morikawa. Say it. Mo-ri-ka-wa. Good. You be careful. Koji, Yasuko. Your son Taro has left me. This is it. Everything is done. At least Taro will be happy. Rest 'ln peace my children. It's best this way. Damn war! Stupid war! The A-bomb! Maggots... The dead are all maggots. Please take care of my Taro, Iwakichl. Didn't he say anything else? Iwa-san! Lwa-san! Taro... Eat your fill, there, s plenty more. No, I'll go back. L'lsten, Taro... Let's read a picture book. Yes, a picture book. Please come quickly! Hurry! Oh Taro... The young miss is here. Taro, too. Iwan-san, it's me. Take good care of Taro. Don't you worry about Taro. Where is he? Here I am. You watch your health. And mind you do as you're told. Grandfather! Give my body for research. My scars ache in winter as if full of needles. Iwa-san! Grandfather! Iwa-san! Let's go. Rest in peace, Iwa-san. Taro has gone with her. I wanted to see him off but just couldn't. He looks so sad. It's natural. Taro. You take care now. Grandad is coming too. He is? That's wonderful. Show him the ocean, okay? Let's get on board. Sayonara, Taro. Sayonara. Look! An airplane! Over there! Miss Ishikawa, you'd better hurry up. Farewell Taro. THE END
