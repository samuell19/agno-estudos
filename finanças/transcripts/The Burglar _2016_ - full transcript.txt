And Chen and Oshri who work here? ﻿No. ﻿Can you reserve room 103 for tomorrow? ﻿Okay, I need your ID and one night in advance. ﻿Can you pay this? ﻿Otherwise it's fun, but the Israe... ﻿Do you see Sha'uli, the fox? - Yes. ﻿You know why he has no tail? - Why? ﻿When he was born, his mother died. ﻿So no one kept him from eating his own tail. ﻿This is a fennec fox. ﻿They always live in couples. And you know what else he can do? ﻿What? ﻿He can jump one meter from the ground without building up momentum. ﻿Let's say goodbye to Sha'uli? - Goodbye, Sha'uli! ﻿Chen? ﻿Chen? Hmm? ﻿It's quite a lot... ﻿when Jupiter and Venus together... ﻿are going out hand in hand, ﻿hand in hand, hand in hand ﻿in the sky. ﻿Hey, hey! You owe me half. ﻿They already admonished me. They will throw you out. ﻿Tomorrow. ﻿Yoram? ﻿Hi, yes, I talked to your mother. ﻿She called you? She's coming back? ﻿What? ﻿Let's meet tomorrow. I'll tell you. ﻿What? Tell me now. ﻿Let's meet tomorrow. I'll tell you. ﻿No, tell me now. - 1 can't now, I'm busy. Tomorrow. Bye. ﻿Hi. - Hi! So? ﻿I talked to her. - What did she say? ﻿She really is with this Ruby now. ﻿She said, she tried to call you several times. ﻿Sweetie, enough! Wait! Why are you doing this? ﻿She is very worried about you. ﻿She is worried and said that in the meantime you could work in the zoo. ﻿And she asked me to lend you some money. ﻿Because you need to pay the rent. ﻿So, take this. ﻿She also said that she'll come back soon. ﻿She will call you a couple of days before. ﻿What's happening, little girl? ﻿You need to pay the bill. ﻿And bring your ID. ﻿They'll burn me at the stake, understand? ﻿I'll give it to you in a few days, okay? ﻿If it was up to me, I would cancel the debt. ﻿But I have a manager. ﻿Nothing escapes his eyes. ﻿He's a miser and ugly. ﻿A fat and ugly miser. ﻿What's going on with you? ﻿What? ﻿I know that you're in Shir's class. ﻿What are you doing? ﻿What do you want from me? ﻿Mmm... I don't know. ﻿Tomorrow I'll give you all the money. ﻿Everything. ﻿Okay. ﻿Everything is alright. ﻿They are the only young males in the pod. ﻿From the moment that the gate to the open sea closes ﻿they are captives. ﻿On the other side of the barrier, in the pod, a birth takes place. ﻿Dolphins always were protagonists in our mythology. ﻿In the bay of Delphi Apollo shifted his shape into a dolphin. ﻿That is why they are called dolphins. ﻿There is a legend in Brazil that a young girl and a dolphin met on every full moon night ﻿and made love. ﻿Aborigines in Australia believe that they are direct descendants of a pod of dolphins. ﻿In Greece they were considered gods. ﻿If a human killed a dolphin, he was sentenced to death. ﻿Shut up. ﻿Shut up, shut up. ﻿Shut up, shut up... ﻿Hi, you've reached Mary. Please leave a message. Bye! ﻿Mom. ﻿Mom... Please answer me... ﻿Answer... Answer... for once. ﻿Just once, please... ﻿I need you to answer me, please. ﻿Answer! Why do you never answer? Why? Why do you never answer? ﻿Answer! You stupid! Answer me already. ﻿You idiot! ﻿Answer...

Where were you? ﻿Don't be angry, sweetie. I... ﻿I know, it was sudden. But... ﻿It was good that I left. ﻿I came back with 4 months of rent. ﻿Yossi lets me do what I want there... ﻿so it makes the best profit. ﻿What's with you? Are you okay? ﻿Uh... hm. ﻿Yes, this... ﻿This whole story was not easy for me. ﻿He thinks, he is doing me a favor. No... ﻿He doesn't get that I am doing 10 times more than any... ﻿Than any of the others are doing for him. But okay... ﻿Shouts at me like crazy every night if he thinks I haven't sold enough. ﻿He's crazy. Fucked up. Leave it. ﻿I am not going there anymore. ﻿That was the last time. ﻿Maybe sit next to me? ﻿Okay... ﻿Alright. Whatever you want. ﻿You are a big girl already. I don't... ﻿You know... we don't have a choice. ﻿I'm getting a drink. Do you want some too? ﻿No. ﻿Come here. ﻿Come on. ﻿Come here. ﻿You are so beautiful. ﻿I wish I would be only half as beautiful. ﻿My sweetheart. ﻿What happened to the house? ﻿Someone broke in. ﻿Oh God... ﻿God, that's scary... ﻿They're all such assholes here. ﻿Did you call the police? ﻿And? ﻿Nothing. ﻿Okay, at least you are alright. ﻿Everything is good and nothing happened, right? ﻿Look, that's what we sold there. Beautiful, no? ﻿For you. ﻿Thank you. ﻿You don't like it. ﻿No... ﻿It's really nice. ﻿You will take care of me, right? ﻿Right, my love? - Yes. ﻿I couldn't go on without you. ﻿You are my life. ﻿Will you take care of me? ﻿Okay. ﻿I'm getting something to eat, do you want to? ﻿Yes, sure.
