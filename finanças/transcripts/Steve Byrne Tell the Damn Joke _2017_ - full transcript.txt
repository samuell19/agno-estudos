♪♪ (audience clapping) (audience cheering) - Hello, I'm Steve Byrne. This is my wife, Ok Cha. This is our other son, Will. (cheering) - Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. I'm going to introduce the funniest man in the whole world. Here, this is Steve Byrne! (cheers and applause) - How are ya? Good. Thank you. Thank you! How are ya? Good to see ya. Thank you, thank you. We're good, thank you. Thank you guys so much, appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you all for making time. I appreciate it. It's good to be back here in Chicago. How 'bout it for Jamiah, everybody? Awesome. My brother, my parents. How 'bout it for my mom? Who addressed you all like a Korean dictator. So, let's get into this. I recently turned 40. Let me tell you something about turning 40. When you turn 40, you will hear this in your life, and hopefully you will hear it the rest of your life. "You look good for 40." "You look good for 52." "You look great for 63." You never hear that when you're young. You never hear, "You look good for 19." If you hear "You look good for 19," guess what? You look like shit for 19. You should never hear that. I gotta say, I, uh... I embrace that I'm in my 40s. I'm not gonna run away from it. I know this: it's over. Over. No more medium t-shirts for this asshole. Naw. Those days are long gone. Saturday rolls around, a friend calls you up, "Hey, we get fucked up tonight?" "No, we're not." "What are you gonna do?" "There's a two-hour 'Dateline', is what I'm gonna do." I gotta solve a murder with Lester Holt this evening. I don't want to sound grim, I don't want to sound negative, but once I turned 40, I accept death a little more. Like, I don't want to die. I want to live a long life, I want to see all those "Star Wars" movies too, okay? But... but if death happened to me tomorrow, it's like, fuck it, I'm tired. I'm exhausted right now and I just got to work. People are like, "You look tired." "I am. 40 years of this bullshit. I'm beat." This is what I mean about losing the will to live, okay? If I have a large cardboard box, I gotta take it out to the recycling garbage cans. This box won't fit in the garbage cans. I gotta go back in, I gotta get scissors, I gotta come back out, I gotta break it-- You know what? I'd rather die than break down this box, honestly. Fuck the Earth. Sorry, Earth, not this week. If I go to a gas station, I swipe my card at the pump, it says, "Please come inside, see attendant." I'd rather die than go inside and see that attendant. I'd literally rather get in my car and drive three miles to another gas station than walk ten feet... I'd literally rather drive three miles than walk ten feet into your piece-of-shit place of business 'cause you don't have your shit together. Fuck you, come see me. You know where the money is, asshole. (cheering) You guys getting excited to vote for a new president? (cheering) - (man) Bernie! - Tell you what... I'd rather die than vote for any of these fuckers. All of them. The worst. This is what I truly love about every election cycle. Every election cycle, there's a member of the press that will ask a candidate, especially a male candidate, this question. Now, the purpose of that question is to see if the candidate is in touch with the common folk. This is that question. "Sir, do you know the price of a gallon of milk?" They never know. And I'll tell you why they don't know in a second, but first off, to any man that's gonna run for elected office, know this. They're gonna ask you that question, be prepared. Here's how you hit them back. "Sir, do you know the price of a gallon of milk?" "Absolutely not, no. I'm lactose-intolerant. "I can't enjoy ice cream or cereal "because I have a fear I'll shit my pants. Anything else? Moving on." Now, here's why a man does not know the price of a gallon of milk. He's married. He has a family. And that wife won't let him go grocery shopping, okay? My wife will not let me be responsible for feeding our family for a week 'cause if I go grocery shopping, we're eating Steak-Umms and DiGiornos every day for seven days. "Candidate Byrne, do you know the price of a gallon of milk?" "I know a meatball DiGiornos is $7.99, I do know that." "Right, the question is a gallon of milk." "I know a 12-pack of Sunkist is $2.99, I do know that. "I'm 40 years old and I eat like an eighth-grader. Next question." Now, when it comes to politics, I think some people are-- They just know out of the gates when they're born their affiliation. Some people, it just takes time, where you grew up, your influenced by friends and family. For me, I always liked a little on this side, I always liked a little on this side. Now I definitely know my stance these days. So, if someone's like, "Hey, what's your take on the death penalty? "How do you feel about our presence in the Middle East? What's your stance on abortion rights?" Here's my take on all those and more. I don't give a shit. I could give a flying fuck. None of that shit applies to my daily life, okay? I don't hang with murderers. I don't know anybody on death row, so I don't care. The Middle East, they've been fighting for thousands of years, we're not gonna change that, and thank God my daughter is not old enough to fuck. I don't give a shit. Okay? Here are the pressing issues in my life, okay? I'm ten years away from Centrum Silver. My back sucks, my vision's gone, my right knee's a little wonky, my wife doesn't think I give her enough back massages. I have been putting off an oil change for 2-1/2 months. Is my engine gonna blow today? I don't know. Let's roll the dice. These are the issues. I think when you turn 40, you look back on the goals you made for yourself in your 20s and 30s and think, did I hit those benchmarks? Have I accomplished my goals? I think I've done some damage, but I haven't hit my ultimate goal. This is what I truly want in life. I want "fuck you" money. I want money that's undeniable, you can just splash somebody in the face with it. I want money that's powerful, you just sit down, "Hey, you can't sit there." "What?" "You can't sit there." "Oh, I can't sit here? "Come here. Fuck you!" "Now pick that up." We... We've all been outside of a bar, right? Your bouncer won't let you or your friends in. One of your friends is so tanked, he's like, "You're not gonna let us in? You know what, you piece of shit? I could buy this-- No! I could buy this place." I always want to say that. But I can't. I mean, technically, I could. It's like, "You're not gonna let me in? Are you serious? "Just so you know, I could buy this place, okay? "With a second mortgage out on my house, a... "government-assisted loan, definite loan from my parents. "I probably would not turn a profit for seven, eight years "'cause I have no experience in the nightlife industry. "I'd probably keep you on, you're competent at your job, but technically, so you know, I could buy this place." At my age, I will admit certain things to you all right now that I would never tell you in my 20s. 30s, I might, but I'd err on the side of caution. 40, I don't give a shit anymore. I'll tell you, as a man, I have had a cat boner. It's always women. Women always say, "What?" But most guys are like, "Yeah, I think I know what he's talking about." You guys know what I am talking about. You go visit your girl or you're with your girl, she got a cat, cat jumps on your lap, you start petting it. "Oh, that's a good girl. "Oh, you're frisky, okay. You like-- Oh, that's the spot. I gotcha, okay, that's the..." Cat's getting into it, it's like... "Yeah, oh, o-- Oh, shit. "Oh, no, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no. "Gotta get you-- the claw! Get the fuck out of here, all right." That's why I see these men in their 50s going to the pharmacy, going to these boner pills. Fuck that. Go to a shelter. Adopt. Don't make that sick, honey. It's a girl cat. It was a fucking girl cat. It's not a dude cat. I'm not disgusting. "So gross. Oh, let's go to the comedy show and take the jokes seriously." Jesus. We got 40 minutes left. It's gross. At my age, I believe in social justice. By social justice, I mean this. If you cut in front of me at a bank, at an airport, in any line, I will say something to you now at my age. When I was younger, I wouldn't say anything, but 40 years on this planet it's like, I'm gonna say something. So if you cut in front of me at a bank, this is what comes out, okay? It sounds polite, it's kind of passive-aggressive, but this ultimately is what happens, okay? So, if you cut in front of me, this is what comes out. "Excuse me, pardon me, there's a line. Excuse me, there's a line." That's what comes out. What's in here is, "Hey, fuck face! "Get the fuck back there, you piece of shit! You better than everybody?!" "Enjoy the walk, your majesty. Get the fuck-- go. "Get out of my face. Walk." And all that comes out as, "Excuse me, there's a line." Now, if you're gonna be a man and parade around town wearing a badge and become a social sheriff, know this. There will come times where you question yourself. Was it worth it? Should I have opened my mouth? I had an incident recently where I questioned myself. I was... I was with my family at Disneyland, okay? So, you wait for hours to go on all these rides. Finally, we go to eat lunch. I waited in line 33 minutes to spend $28 on chicken fingers, which is reasonable, right? Wait in line, wait in line, wait-- Finally, at the front of the line ready to place my order, a guy walks on the other side of the register, she takes the order. I go, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, excuse me. Can we just create our own line here?" He goes, "Actually, I'm a season pass holder. There's always two lines. You just didn't--" I go, "I'm not talking to you. "I'm definitely not talking to you. Excuse me, can we just create our own line here?" She goes, "Is there a problem, sir?" I go, "There is now, yeah. I'd like to see your manager." She says, "Excuse me?" I go, "I want to see your manager." She says this to me: "But... this is the happiest place on Earth." "Not today it's not, bitch. Get that goddamned manager now. Now!" Now, that's what I said in my head. I didn't say that out loud. What came out loud was, "Okay." So I pay... aggressively. Now I'm in the ball pen with all the other parents, right? The manager comes over, I reiterate my story out of principle. As I do, the guy is right there, he pipes up again, he goes, "I wasn't cutting. I'm a season pass holder. There's always two--" I go, "Dude, you're cheap. Shut up, shut up." As I say "shut up," I realize this. Everybody in front of me and behind me is uncomfortable. My wife is pissed off. I can feel her body heat and it is August in Southern California. That is heat. My daughter's crying. This man wants to fight me. And as I say "shut up," behind him walks his eight-year-old son and I just dressed down his hero in front of his very eyes. All these variables hit me in a second and then the manager says this to me: "Sir, I am so sorry, so here's what I can do. I can offer you a free cupcake." "Well, then I'll take that cupcake, please sir, "Yeah, I'll take it. Yeah, okay. "Sprinkles? Chocolate, yeah. I earned it. Give it. Give me the goddamned-- Give me the cupcake now." She hands me the cupcake, I hold the cupcake in front of my wife, I'm like, "Got a cupcake out of it, right, kinda cool?" It is not cool. It is not cool. The guilt drives me down to the ground and I kneel down in front of that little eight-year-old boy and I hold out that cupcake. Yeah. And I take a big-ass bite of that cupcake. Now, my wife didn't talk to me for an hour, but I didn't give a shit. I kept a sprinkle in the corner of my mouth like a single teardrop tattoo. Letting her know, that's a man you married, bitch. That is a man you married, bitch. And here's the lesson in this story. The lesson is this. I am now a very proud season pass holder at Disneyland, so... thank you. Now, I've been married for 4-1/2 years, we've been together for eight. I'm glad I met my wife when I did. I met her before a lot of dating apps, social media. Everything so accessible right there on your cell phone. Look, I got great guy friends, best friends. I see the representation of my friends in profile pictures, I don't know who that guy is. This is my point, I'm talking to every fella in this room. Pay attention, gentlemen, know this. You're not sexy. Okay? Visually, you're not, so please no more selfies in front of a gym mirror doing bicep curls and duck lips. It's got to stop. Nobody wants to go online and see who's shirtless in front of a Toyota Corolla doing Taekwondo with a boner. Please! Uncool. You want to take a picture of something sexy, you take a picture of a balanced checkbook with a lot of zeroes in it. That apparently is very sexy. And fuck you whores. You just fell for my trap. I smoked you out. I know who you gold diggers are. You single ladies know this. I don't shed a tear for single ladies. I'm so tired of girls. "It's hard out there. "You know, it's really difficult to meet a guy. It's tough to meet a man." Is it? Go outside. They're fucking everywhere. Honestly, pick up a rock, throw it, you'll hit a dude. Here's a challenge, girls. Go out when nobody's out, you'll still see guys. Go to a gas station at midnight, oh, hey, a guy. Go to a Walgreen's Pharmacy at 4:00 in the morning, oh, look, another guy. Go take a piss in the woods, you hear a branch snap, that's definitely a guy. Everywhere. Now, I love my wife. I adore her. I think the world of her. She is my wife. But there are definitely times in my life I'm like, why are you here? Why? I'll give you an example. Any time I watch television with her. I spend 100-plus dollars on an infinite amount of cable channels a month. Why? Can I just buy one for her? HGTV. That's all she watches, HGTV. And I try to watch this horseshit with her. Horseshit. It's manure. Let me summarize every HGTV show for you, okay? Some real estate agent that's just trying to do their job is showing around a couple-- a bunch of properties, and this couple's just constantly complaining the whole time. "Oh, my God, these floorboards are creaky. "P.U., it smells in here. Did somebody die? "These drapes are old. How far is the city? I don't like this commute. I want to build my man cave." It's like, shut the fuck up and wait 28 minutes. You ever seen the show before? It's gonna be awesome. I watch these couples, I'm like, fuck these two, I hope they're never happy. I hope they die in a house fire. Fuck 'em. That's the show I'd watch, "House Fire." 13th property, I'd padlock it, light it, get the fuck... "Bye, fuck you guys." But look, at the same time, my wife does not want to watch my shows. Now, I love "Ghost Hunters." Okay? Now, here's the thing I know about every property that is haunted in these United States, okay? It's haunted by a ghost from the late 1800s to early 1900s. That's every ghost. It's a man in a regal suit with a bowstring tie and a derby cap or a woman in a ruffled Victorian dress with a pennant of a silhouetted daughter who died at the age of six of the flu. It's like, this is... every morbid ghost. It's time to update these ghosts. And I'll be part of that movement 'cause I will die in my house and I will stay in my house, I will never leave my house because I paid off a 30-year mortgage in that house. That is my house. I will haunt this house. (cheers and applause) I'll haunt it. But I'll be cool. I'll be a cool ghost. People will be like, "Yeah, there's a comedian "that used to live in this house and, uh, "it's said he can be seen "roaming the halls after midnight "in boxer briefs? "He's been described as having the body of a cubicle worker. "Anytime he appears, "the scent of Stouffer's French bread supreme pizza "permeates the living space. "And he can be heard repeating over and over again, "'Is the Wi-Fi down? Is the Wi-Fi down?' 'Oh, fuck you, Time Warner, the Wi-Fi's down.'" Now, I'll haunt the house, but I'll be cool. I'll be cool with that dad. 'Cause I live in my house now with my family, one day a new family come in, I'll be cool with that dad. And that dad could confide to his friends how cool I am. Like, you know what's weird, fellas? I think I have a ghost in my house because the kids are in bed, the wife's in bed, right, it's late at night. I got the iPad out, I'm jerking off, watching some porn, and I feel like there's a presence next to me jerking off with me. Oohhh. Oohhh. Sorry, Mom. You know, like, if you have a piano, it's late at night, the piano's playing, "dunh, dunh, dunh!" Ghost playing the piano, pack the shit, we're selling this house, it's haunted, let's go. I won't do stuff like that. I will not. I'll do cool stuff. But the dad will be with the wife, he'll be like, "You know what, honey, it's weird, "we leave for that party, right? "I know when we left, I shut my laptop, okay? "But then we come home, my laptop is obviously up "and there's porn playing on my laptop. "And it's not like one window, "there's like 28 windows of porn playing on my laptop. "And I'll shut it in disgust "and I feel, like, this male presence "leave the room in embarrassment. And is followed by a ghost cat." (laughter and applause) Now, that's gross. Over time, I've discovered that my wife definitely and I have a different sense of humor. There are things I witness that-- sometimes I'm like, oh, I'm glad I'm with my guy friends to appreciate this, and I'll give you an example. I was in Las Vegas recently, we go to Mandalay Bay, there's a lazy river in the back, people floating, laying along the lazy river. I hit this one bend and there was this gorgeous, gorgeous woman laying out with a bikini completely to the side, okay? So, the vagina is out. Out, the only thing more out than this vagina is Clay Aiken. It is out. And I am mesmerized, as any man would be. Right, I'm a man, I'm floating through it, it's like, "Yeah, let's, uh, let's go to a fight tonight, "not a 'Cirque' show, let's go see that fight. "That's what we'll do, yeah. We're gonna have a good time. I'll lock up the tickets, we're gonna go... will..." "Guys, come here. "Look, look, look, look, look,look, look, look. "We have to go again. We have to, it's free. "Come on. Paid a lot to see that last night. Let's go, paddle, paddle, paddle, paddle, paddle." We keep lapping this pool like we had never seen a vagine in our lives. I timed it. Three hours, seven minutes. That is a "Lord of the Rings" film in prune hands. That's what we accomplished that day. But I know for a fact if my wife's in my situation, she's floating with her girlfriends, shoots a bend in the pool, there's a dude laying out with his nuts dropped like a bad transmission, just a two-piece chilling outside of a pair of board shorts like a hairy chandelier. She doesn't appreciate that. "Let's get a mimosa. "But I'll share it with you 'cause it's daytime. "I want to enjoy my day, I want to enjoy my night "'cause we're gonna have so much fun this weekend, girls. We're gonna have so much..." "Don't turn around. Don't, no. (heavy breathing) "You can't unsee what I just saw. "As a matter of fact, we're leaving. "We're not staying here. I saw this thing. We're getting-- "Tina, I don't give a shit what you found on Priceline, we're getting the fuck out now!" (cheers and applause) You get me and my guy friends floating through a pool, there's a dude laying out with his nuts popped out. "Yeah, let's, uh, let's get a steak. "Not a Mexican or Italian, let's get a steak dinner. "Let's treat ourselves like gentlemen. Let's do it, right? Like a bunch of g..." "Guys, come here. "Look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look. "Oh, we have to go again. It's free, we have to. "I'm gonna name my boys. I'm gonna name 'em. I'll call that one Lance, that one Armstrong." I will say this, over the course of my marriage, and aspiring to always be a better husband... I will say this, the biggest lesson I've had to learn in terms of trying to be a better husband and a great partner in life is that my wife is very sensitive. So, I gotta watch what I say. As a comic, I gotta watch what I say, particularly when it comes to body image, you know? She's very sensitive, she's-- you know, we live in Los Angeles. She is not some skinny waif who's gonna drink juice smoothies and do yoga all day. No, this is a girl from Minnesota. This is why I married her. This is the kind of girl I could walk into Cheesecake Factory with. As soon as we walk in, we'll look at each other like, whoa, whoa, whoa. We gonna fuck up that cake? (cheers and applause) We're like people at a dog pound. It's like, "You're coming home with us. "You're coming home with us. You're coming home with us. I want to take them all home." So, here's the lesson I had to learn, okay? The other day, I was sitting on my couch, watching TV, she comes in with a laundry basket full of clothes from the dryer and dumps it on the couch next to me, which means... we're folding laundry? What the fuck? Now, I gotta preface this next part with letting you know, my wife has got a big ass, okay? I am not speaking out of school. She'd be the first to tell you or admit it, she got a big butt. Like, if you saw my wife from behind, you'd be like, "Oh, I bet she's married to a professional athlete." You got it? You get what I... Like, if you saw my wife from behind, you'd be like, "Oh, I bet she's married to somebody that always votes Democrat." (man) - Whoo! - I don't think you guys-- okay, um, like if you saw my wife from behind, you'd be like, "Oh, I bet she's married to somebody that owns at least one Tyler Perry DVD." (man) - Whoo! - A black guy, he got it. A black guy. There we go. Black guy. So, she has a big ass. So, I go in this laundry pile, the first thing I pick out are these cut-off sweat shorts that she wears. I wasn't even thinking, just reflexively this comes out. I hold them up, I go, "Whoa!" Everything got quiet, everything. Even the guy golfing on TV was like... The way I said "whoa" is not the way any woman would like to hear her waistline described. The way I said "whoa" was the way you say "whoa" when you see the Grand Canyon for the first time. Whoa! Not pants. Not pants. So, I know I messed up, right? And I slowly, slowly look over at my wife and I see the tear develop there. (audience) - Aww. - Now, it didn't drop, so it's not official, okay? We've all had tears peek-a-boo, they go back in. So, to me, unless it's moonwalking on that cheek, I don't give a shit. Your feelings ain't hurt. It's not a real tear. But I know I messed up. And I'm like, "I'm so sorry, I love you. "I love you so much, I wasn't think--" "Get out. Get out of this house." "I got it. I'm gonna fold it all. "Go get some fresh air. That's what you should-- "Take a lap around the neighborhood. "Take a long lap around that-- take a few laps, "get those laps that are... "I'm not saying you need the exercise. "That's not what I was... "You know I love you and I love your a... "You think about this. A few years ago, "girls spent thousands of dollars on surgery "to get fat sucked out of their ass. "Now they get surgery to get fat put in their ass. "And you don't need it 'cause you already got the fa-- I'm gonna shut the fuck up." (exhales) (laughter and applause) That's when my wife walked over to the laundry pile and she picked up my boxer briefs and she goes, "Medium." And that's when I learned that those tears are real. It's a real tear. It does count. Now, my wife is sensitive. I am not sensitive. My guy friends are certainly not sensitive. And if I could encapsulate an event that occurred recently where something is socially acceptable to a group of my guy friends and certainly not to my wife, it would be this. A few weeks ago, my wife asked to borrow my phone. I said, "Sure, take it. No problem." Her battery died. She walks away. Every guy's worst nightmare happened to me. Sexual text messages start popping up on my phone. She stopped dead in her tracks, she walks over, she goes, "What the hell is this?" I take it, I'm like, "Oh, shit. "Oh, God, oh, oh. I'm so sorry. "I'm sorry you had to see this, this is so bad. "But you're reading the text messages, "you're not reading the names. "These are my guy friends. "You see, I'm having a very bad Fantasy Football Sunday "because I'm losing so bad, they're telling me all the shit they're gonna do to my body." Yeah, "Steve, I can't wait to bend you over and fuck you straight up in that wet pussy of yours." Okay, I don't have a pussy, and if I did, it wouldn't get wet from losing. I have no idea what that means. That's confusing. "Steve, I'm just letting you know that when I fuck you like this, this is strictly physical." "There's no emotions involved, so don't try to kiss me or make eye contact with me." "You will never meet my friends or family. You're my fuck toy." That's not nice. You don't... don't talk to someone like that. "Steve, I wish I could scientifically prove "I could get a man's face pregnant when I blow my load in your mouth." It's creative. She goes... "Is this what you and your friends do?" "Yes? Yes, yes. "Do you guys text? You don't... What do-- what do you girls text each other?" She's like, "Baby pictures and recipes." "That is not on this phone. "There are no baby pictures or-- "Oh, here's a recipe for... semen. "Steve, this season has been such a debacle for you "that for the remaining few weeks, "I'll make it nice on you. "I will refrain from touching myself "and keep a steady diet of pineapple. "I will develop... "such a sweet, heavy load that when I dump it on you, "it will resemble the end of the movie 'Carrie,' "but instead of blood, it will be my semen "drowning you and your entire township. Hashtag: dessert time." What the fuck? (exhales) She goes, "Why is this happening?" "I had a bad draft?" She's like, "You're disgusting." I'm like, "I'm the fucking victim." Well, no easy segue to this one. We have a daughter now. Sorry. Got a little girl. Got a little boy. I wanna do my best now as a father to impart upon them some words of wisdom, some life lessons, some shortcuts. Look, I know they're not gonna listen to me. They're gonna make up their own... But, look, it's not gonna prevent me from trying to be a good pop and pass down some knowledge. You know, I'm 40, I learned most of my lessons. I definitely still have some to learn. But I like to pass it down. Like, how old are you, buddy, right here? 22? You look good for 22. Jesus Christ. Are you a smoker? God damn, dude. Now, what's your name? - Ken. - Ken? All right, first off, let's lose the attitude, Ken. I don't know where that's coming from. Ken, enjoy your 20s. 20s are the best. People will say, "College are the best years of your life." I absolutely disagree. Your 20s are. You're... Take as many pictures of yourself as you can right now because the rest of your life, you'll be trying to get back to what you have right now. If you wake up and look at yourself in the mirror and go, "Oh, fuck," kill yourself now. Right now, you are the '96 Bulls. Ten-- Yeah. (cheering) Ten years from now, you're Jordan on the Wizards. It's gonna get sad. There's a blissful ignorance to your 20s. For example, you most likely do not know what kale is yet. Exactly. Kale's not on your grocery list. At 22, you don't even have a grocery list. Here's your grocery list at 22: Chipotle-- that's your grocery list. Kale is a rich, nutrient-ridden leaf. It's overpriced, it tastes like shit. But once you turn 30, you will eat kale because you're getting back on track, baby! I can't stand people in their early 30s who are like, "I'm eating right, "I've been working out for six months. I'm in the best shape of my life." That ship has sailed, my friend. The best shape of any of our lives, between the ages of four to eight years old. That is the best shape of your life. You climb a tree, you fall down, you cry for two minutes. Next you know, you're going down stairs in a cardboard box. That's unbelievable shape. Okay, you-- you on Tinder? Look at me like a fucking man. Are you on Tinder? No. I respect you. As a fellow, I will say this. I find Tinder to be very condescending. The audacity of some of you guys to just sit there and visually swipe on faces dictating who and who is not fuck-worthy in your little kingdoms on your phone. If you have the balls to use Tinder in the privacy of your phone, you should have the balls to use Tinder in real life. Go to a bar, tap a girl on her shoulder, wait for her to turn around. "Oh, Jesus Christ." "Oh, God. This is the worst Chili's ever!" (cheers and applause) Ken, are you single? Yeah. Listen, um... Do me this favor, and I really mean this as a fella. You got your whole life ahead of you, starting to date, whatever, you've got some girls on, whatever. Look, never, ever, ever look at a girl and say, "That girl is out of my league." You always give love a shot, always give love a shot. Very few girls are truly out of your league, looks-wise, okay? This is what I mean. Um, go to a hot spot, find a girl you like, look at her and go, "Aw, she's stunning, she'd never..." Stop yourself. Then you look at that girl and you picture that girl as an Applebee's waitress. And if you can picture that girl working at Applebee's, you got a fucking shot. Every Applebee's... every Applebee's has one hottie, okay? And very few women are too stunning to work at Applebee's. Here's what I mean. Jennifer Lawrence, she's stunning, she's beautiful, she's a movie star, she's talented. "Silver Linings Playbook," "Hunger Games," she's got it all. You think without that talent, she's working at Applebee's? Oh, you better believe it. Reese Witherspoon, you see her working at Applebee's? Yeah. Probably a district manager within nine months. Fast track. Angelina Jolie. You see her kicking open a kitchen door with some sizzling fajitas in tow trying to upsell you on a piña colada during happy hour? Fuck, no. Angelina Jolie has never and will never step foot inside of an Applebee's. So, you're sitting there saying to yourself, "I got a shot with most girls, but probably not Angelina Jolie." And, Ken, you are correct. But know this. For every Angelina Jolie, there is a Billy Bob Thornton. (cheers and applause) So, get out there and be that Billy Bob Thornton. And, Ken, you are halfway there. So sorry. What a nice guy. Um, you ever been in a bar fight? No? Do me this favor, and I truly mean this, never, ever, ever in a bar fight a man in his mid-30s or older, ever. Because you're in a bar to meet girls. He's in a bar because he's angry. Right? Shit didn't work out the way he thought it was gonna. So, when you find yourself on the floor of a bar getting your face rocked, like, "Fuck, this guy's got a lot of rage." Oh, yes, he does. And he ain't punching you, he's punching a 401(k), retirement, college tuition, divorce. He's taking prescription pills with a side effect of explosive diarrhea. That's a dangerous line to walk every day of your life. He's punching you, "I'm not good enough to be Amazon Prime?" Nothing to do with you. Nothing. Well, these are some honest-to-goodness true, absolute lessons I want to instill upon my children. I want to tell them, live by the golden rule. Treat others as you'd want to be treated. There is no joke there. I tell them, always tell the truth, be honest. Lies fester, they beget lies, you gotta keep track of the web of lies. It's never worth it. Tell the truth, be honest. Unless it's the beginning of a relationship. The first two months in any relationship, you're allowed to lie. And I'll tell you why, okay? My wife and I recently, we were going to Las Vegas. There's a young couple at the gate all over each other, so you know it's not gonna work out. And, uh... the guy gets up, he goes, "Baby, baby, I gotta get "my shoes shined, so I'll be back in a few minutes, but it will be a few minutes." She goes, "It's okay." And he walks away, he goes, "Oh, shoot, you know something? "I'm gonna get a sandwich too to eat, "so shoeshine, sandwich, I'll be back. Text me if you want something to eat too, okay?" She goes, "Great." He walks away. "Oh, gosh, I'm so sorry. I gotta get a magazine "to read on the plane too, so shoeshine, "sandwich, magazine. Text me, I'll get it. It's gonna be a few." She goes, "It's fine." I go, "He's gotta take a shit." My wife hits me and goes, "Will you shut up?" I'm like, "He's gotta take a shit. Just say you gotta take a shit, dude!" But you can't say "I've gotta take a shit" five weeks into a fresh relationship. You can't be honest. You can't tell the truth. You can't be the guy that's like, "Baby, baby, baby! We did it up last night-- "Jäger, Patrón, Fireball, back to Jäger. "Then all those Stellas and Blue Moons. "Then you took me to Denny's. "I got those spicy buffalo tenders, "a French onion soup, a flapjack, "three sausage links, and five orange juices. "I gotta tell ya, I got a timebomb brewing "in this tum-tum right now, okay? "So, what Daddy's gotta do, "I've got to Macarena over that restroom "and rock a deuce. 'Cause if I get 30,000 up "in that bird, whatever I do in the back of that bird, it could be considered an act of terrorism." I've got to tell you, you guys really get behind a good shit joke. Thank you. (chuckles) I want to tell my kids, "Don't go through life being 100% prejudiced, okay? You can be 25% prejudiced." And I'll tell everybody in this room right now, I am prejudiced, okay? I'm not gonna sugarcoat it and pretend I'm not. I'm prejudiced. And it's not racial. Not racial at all. I'll give you an example, okay? If I drive in the left lane of a highway and you ride my ass in the left lane of that highway, my actions are now gonna become dependent upon your make and model. I will prejudge you. If you ride my ass in the left lane of a highway in a Honda Civic-- a Honda Civic-- you can go fuck yourself in your Honda Civic. You have not worked hard enough in life for me to be an inconvenience to you in a goddamned Civic. Oh, now you're in a hurry to get shit done? Now you've got priorities? No, no, no, no, no. What average event do you have to get to in an average car that quickly in a Civic? Stay in line, asshole. No one's missing you. You ride my ass in the left lane of a highway in a minivan? You shouldn't be in the left lane of a highway in a minivan. You have children in that minivan, and if you don't have children, you shouldn't have bought a minivan, you pervert. You ride my ass in the left lane of a highway in a Toyota Prius? (mocking voice) Well, shouldn't you be on a bicycle? You ride my ass in the left lane of a highway in a Porsche, Lamborghini, Jaguar, Ferrari... respect. Let me get out of your way so you can keep doing some cool shit, my friend. Probably in a rush to get to an orgy. Go fuck 'em all for me. You're my hero! You never use condoms! You ride my ass in the left lane of a highway in a Kia? A Kia? I am dousing you with windshield wiper fluid. I am pulling that bitch back and I am hosing you. I'm watching you in the rearview going, "Is it raining out?" "No. I hate you." You bought a car because of a hip-hop dancing hamster, you moron? You ride my ass in the left lane of a highway in a pickup truck? I'm getting the fuck off the freeway... because I am not waking up hog-tied in a wheat field next to Ken. Fuck that. As my kids get older, I want to tell them, "Have faith, don't have faith. That is entirely up to you as you get older." I grew up with faith. I still have faith. I believe, uh, it's a good way to go through life, being held accountable by your actions by a higher power. If I could break it down to a microcosm, sneeze next to somebody of faith. It's reassuring. "Ah-choo." "God bless you." They're saying, "Hey, don't get sick on us." Selfishly what they're saying is, "Please don't start a plague." But I'll take that any day over sneezing next to an atheist. "Ah-choo." "No one can help you." I want to tell my kids, "Be accepting of everybody." You know, uh, I think everybody has the right to do whatever it is that makes them happy. I was having a conversation with a friend of mine the other day, and the reason I think this is because he's of the mindset you can become gay. I'm of the mindset you are born gay. And we went back and forth, and we had this little debate. And then he brought up this rumor that back in the day, Mick Jagger banged David Bowie, or vice-versa, depending who you're a bigger fan of. You know, like, whoever's behind. It's up to you. It's... Because I totally get it. Mick Jagger's touring the world. He's banging "10s" after decades, and eventually he's like, "I'm tired of hot chicks. I'm gonna fuck a hot dude." I was like, "Uh, I don't get that at all." 'Cause I'll tell you this, I love eating pizza. I could eat pizza for breakfast, lunch, and dinner seven days a week, 365 days a year. And I don't believe on day 366, I pick up a slice of pizza and go, "I cannot eat one more slice of pizza. It's time to fuck dudes." I don't see it. This has disappeared. It's back. Sit the fuck down. I want to tell my kids something my father told me when I was very young. My father grew up in New York City. He was surrounded by everybody, friends with everybody, still is to this day. And I'll always remember this. He said, "Steve, you never judge "the people as a whole. "You always judge the individual. That's how you go through life. That is how you make friends." And I'll tell my kids the same thing. And I'm gonna tell them this. "Look, this is just an example, guys. An example, okay?" I'm gonna tell them, "You can't hate all Jewish people." That's awful. Of course you can hate a Jewish person, if you have a bad experience with that individual. But it's absolutely unfair to hate all of... Wall Street, the banking industry, the recording industry, television, film, Hollywood itself, doctors, lawyers, etc., our legal system, the Federal Reserve, any sports commissioner, mass media, any landlord or property owner, southern Connecticut, northern Jersey, Upper East Side or West Side of New York City, the whole state of Florida, you can't hate all that. And sometimes I do that joke, and people are like, "Oh, he's anti-Semitic. He hates Jews." No, I don't. They have a good sense of humor. And, look, I love Jews. I work with Jews. My manager's Jewish, my agent's Jewish, my publisher's Jewish, my lawyer's Jewish. You get it. Now, this is the second to last lesson I want to impart upon my kids. I want to tell them, "Have a bartender's year." And that means you listen more than you talk about yourself. Hopefully, that'll get you some great friends. Hopefully, that'll get you this friend, because I believe this is the best friend you can have when you're growing up. Not only that, I believe this is the greatest human being in our country. I'll tell you who it is right now-- fat white girls. Fat... white... girls. And I know this P.C. climate we live in, where everybody's a victim, and somebody in this room right now is going, "Oh, he's being mean! He's being cruel." No, I'm not. I'm being celebratory. I'm going on the books, on record, and letting everybody in this room know right now: I love 'em fat. I love 'em white. And you'd best believe, I love 'em girls. Fat white girls are awesome! Fat white girls are at the forefront of civil rights. Whatever fat white girls do, it takes the rest of the country a few years to catch up to them. Which sounds ironic. I'll give you that. (taps mic) Let's all be honest... honest with each other. 20 years ago, 20 years ago, nobody's fuckin' black guys. 20 years ago, nobody's fucking black guys publicly. But 20 years ago, who's parading around downtown with a care in the world, fuckin' a black guy? A fat white girl. Flash forward to today, who's fucking black guys? Everybody's fucking black guys! Well, thank you, fat white girls. 10 years ago, you're a little gay boy. You want your tongue pierced at Claire's. Well, you can't go with the football team. Well, who's gonna take your little gay ass to the mall? I guess your first friend from junior high school, fat white girl! Flash forward to today, who's got a gay friend? Everybody loves the gays! Well, thank you, fat white girls! Fat white girls, great work! But, you have a new mission, and it starts this evening, effective immediately-- start fucking Asian guys. Turn around so they can see. Yep, come on. (laughter and applause) That's an Asian. If I told everybody in this room, "Shut your eyes and imagine an Asian," that is literally what you would picture, right there. Now, after the show, you get yourself to a Lane Bryant. Or a Torrid. Beat it. All right, let's... (chuckling) Let's... let's switch gears here and change the subject. And I will say, the last lesson for last. Um... (sighing) let me tell you something: at my age, eating McDonald's is a much different experience than when I was younger. By the way, any time I bring up McDonald's, people are like, "Oh, McDonald's is gross. McDonald's is disgusting." Whoa, whoa, whoa. You go to hell. McDonald's is America, okay? McDonald's is my childhood. I am Pavlov's dog to McDonald's. People are like, "It's-- You know, the nuggets, it's pink slime." Well, you know, I'll dip it in barbecue sauce next. McDonald's, you've got a long way to go to disgust me before I stop comin' to you. McDonald's could be like, "And now, we deep fry cat shit!" Put it in a box, give me a toy, we've got a deal! I love McDonald's. And McDonald's, at my age, is the closest I'll come to cheating on my wife. It is the same three emotions: desire, pleasure, guilt. All... within 12 minutes. I'll be driving, minding my own business, right? I see those arches. "Oh, shit! Ooh! "You look good. You look good. "I want you. I want you so bad. I want you inside of me." (exhales sharply) "But, I'm being good, I'm being good "Go home. Go home to your family. "Go home to your family now. "Don't ruin this. Do not... "You deserve it. "You deserve this. You work hard. "You should treat yourself. You're a big boy. Big boys treat themsel--" They're honking, it's green. "The hell with this. It's the right call. "You're gonna feel so much better. This is-- Absolutely not! I'm goin' in, fuck it!" Go in, I pop open that door. The waft of grease hits you. "Welcome home!" Peppery burger, salty fries, sugary soft drink. Give me a sundae, douse it in peanuts and gave me an apple pie. "Oh, fuck, I'm lovin' it!" (McDonald's jingle theme) ♪ Ba-da-ba-ba-baa ♪ 12 minutes later, I'm in my car by myself pinching my side fat. "You fat fuck! "You fat piece of shit. "You keep eating like this, you're gonna fit in your wife's pants." She ain't here. She ain't here. Don't tweet that shit out. Don't let her know I do that. No. I want to tell you all, I actually ran that joke by my wife. Because I love her, I will not make a fool out of her publicly, and, I watch a lot of "Dateline", all right? I'm not waking up at 3:00 in the morning with her shoving her shorts in my mouth like, "Is it funny now, you motherfucker?" (imitating stabbing) This is the actual conversation I had with her, okay? I go, "Look, I got to run a joke by you, and see if you're okay with it." She goes, "Okay, tell me the joke." I tell her the joke, I go, "What do you think?" She goes, "Well..." And I was like, "Do you like driving the Lexus?" She goes, "Tell the goddamn joke, Steve." I'll tell you this... it took me four decades on this planet to realize what a woman means when she says, "I have nothing to wear tonight." I could never relate to that. "I have nothing to wear tonight," you know? My wife, she'll walk out of her closet. Her closet, not ours. Not mine. I get a dresser. Okay? She walks in her closet. "No. No. Pfft. Nope. No. "No. I got nothin'! I have got nothing to wear tonight." "Yeah, me either, "'cause my good shit's on the bottom drawer, and it won't open 'cause it's from Ikea." Got nothing to wear tonight. I never knew what that meant till the other day. I was sitting at home, flipping through my high-def channels. Action, sci-fis, thrillers, dramas, documentaries, romance, Westerns. Apple TV, what have we got on iTunes? We've got Scorsese collection, Spielberg collection, Hitchcock collection, all the Star Wars, all the Star Treks, all the Harry Potters, all the Fast and Furious, all the Jurassic Parks, all the Indiana Jones, all the X-Mens, all the Batmans, all the Supermans, all the Avengers, all the Captain Americas, Thors, Iron Mans, Hulks, all the... There's nothing to watch. (exhales sharply) (sighs) I'm not exercising. See everybody outside? They're all in the backyard. They're playing, the're having fun, right? I'm gonna jerk off. Let's see on this laptop, what have we got here? Amateur, anal, blonde, brunette, redhead, cum shot, glasses, cougar, granny, MILF, cheerleader, teen, interracial-- just say black, who are we kidding? Saw it. Saw it, saw it, seen it, seen it, saw it. Saw it, saw it, seen it, saw it, saw it. Saw it, saw it, saw it, saw it, saw it, saw it... There's nothing to jerk off to? (disappointed) Guess I'll spend time with my family. Sp... Speaking of porn... I love when people are like, "There's such bad acting in porn." Yeah. It's porn! But it's always women that are the bad actors in porn, always girls. "Oh, my God, that is a monster cock! "Gimme that big dick! "Harder, faster, faster, harder! "Oh, my God, I'm gonna come. "Oh, my God, I'm fuckin' coming. Oh, my God, I'm fucking coming!" (man) - Whoo! - That... is some bad acting, guys. Let me tell you this right now. Anything you hear from a man in a porn, he's being extremely honest. "Oh, my God, this feels so good." Guess what? It probably feels pretty good. "Oh, I want to put it in your asshole." Knock, knock. "Who's there?" He's about to put it in your asshole, that guy. "I'm gonna fuckin' come!" Get ready, he's coming. He ain't bluffing. You never see in a porn, "I'm gonna come, "I'm gonna come, I'm gonna... Oh, false alarm. Sorry, guys." Men always tell the truth in porn. "Tell me your PIN number." "4-5-8-6." Men don't lie in porn. That's why, I assure you, you never heard a man say this a porn: "I love you." (audience) - Aww. - Aww. Aww? Aww? Who would 'Aww' that joke? "Aww. "Aww, that poor girl. "She deserves somebody, right? "Aww. "Aww, that girl that just treated her body like a circus clown car, aww." What? That girl? This girl? "Will you love me?" "Will you love me?" "Will you love me?" (muffled) "Will you love me?" That girl? That girl? My fear is, this being taped and all... years from now, my daughter will be at a junior high school-- junior high school lunch table, or on an iPad or a tablet with a bunch of her girlfriends, and there will be a GIF or a video of me on a loop just... And her friends will be like, "I think that's your dad. Is that your dad?" "Oh, in that video? Yeah, that's my dad." "What's he doing?" "In that video? "He's getting butt-fucked... "and he's jerking off like 18 guys "and blowing dudes, but he's working! He's at work." Good. Good job, Steve. That parlays us into the last lesson I want to impart upon my children. And I'm gonna bring Jamiah out to help me with this. How about one more time for Jamiah, everybody? (cheers and applause) What's up, buddy? Thank you so much. Chicago's own. How 'bout it for him, everybody? (cheers and applause) Wanna come on out here? As you set up, I'll let them know. This is the last lesson I want to tell my kids. As I've gotten older, and now, being a father, I definitely want to do a good enough job, along with my wife, to one day think we could look at our kids and... (chuckles, chokes up) (softly) Sorry.
