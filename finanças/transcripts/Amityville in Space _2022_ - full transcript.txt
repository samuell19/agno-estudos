Are we ready? Three, two, one, action. This evening, at the infamous Amityville house, something is about to go down, and we at KC Channel 9, are here to report. We've been following the infamous goings on here for several years. From the hauntings, to the murders, to the priest, who has made it his mission to stop whatever evil resides in this house, on this property, and in our nightmares. Oh, here comes someone now. Follow me. Uh, excuse me, could you tell us what's going on here? Salvation is what's going on here. You're Father Benna. Are you here to perform an exorcism? Much greater. This place, this house is evil incarnate. Its evil has spread like a plague. To stop it, we must strike at its roots. Can you elaborate? I have followed its pathways to extinguish its cancerous reach. Home to home, family to family. A path of devastation. It's led me back here, for a final confrontation of good and evil. Is there anything else you'd like to tell us? Yes, if I were you, I'd leave now. Did you see that? The door shut on its own. Hey, get back here, you chicken shit. Yes, I know you are present, and you sense your time is up. What sayeth you, man of the clothe? I was at the side of the Christ you follow at one time. You can only dream of being as omnipotent as he. You'll bow. You are a mere shadow of the Christ. A failure, licking his wounds and waiting for the day you will be smote out for good. And you are the one who are before me to execute this task, little man? What the hell is going on in there? Hell is what's going on in there. You need to step back. You, Beelzebub, the dark one, Satan, Asmodeus, I command you in the power of the almighty that you hence leave this house, this town. As I command you, so does the living God. No one commands me, you little man. Your god has left you. Now you serve at my side. Never, my God will give me strength. The cross compels you, the cross compels you. Dear God, dear God in heaven, send it away from this earth. In spirit and in place. In spirit and in place. I am who you want. I cannot be lifted. In spirit and in place. Take it away. In spirit and in place. I sacrifice myself to rid the world of this evil. Send us away, now. I can leave with you, my priest. You will follow me in the veil. What the fuck is going on here? Deep breath. Well, that's interesting. Am I gonna live? Oh, your blood pressure's slightly elevated as is your pulse. Well, I can tell you the prognosis for that. What's that? It's from being too close to you in this med lab all alone. I think it's just space stress. Come on, get dressed. Zip up. Oh, thanks doc. Guess I don't get shipped home because of medical reasons. Nope, you're in it for the long haul. Just like the rest of us, Captain. Thank goodness this mission is almost over. These deep space runs seem like an eternity. How old's your son by now? He's three now, thanks. Thanks for asking. Oh, hang in there. My friend there's a black hole out there with your name all over it. Star log, 12478. Black hole destroyer 52 pre-programmed and armed for whenever duty calls for it. Ah, there's nothing more relaxing than cruising through the stars. That is your job, is it not? Yes, it's my job, Vox. Why do you have to ruin someone's fun with your analytical logic? That is my job, Maitland. At least 22.6% of my duties. - 33%- - You know what, Vox? Stow it, Vox. I don't need a rundown of your duties. That's one thing's for sure. What is that? You're a pain in the A-S-S 100% of the time. If you say so, Maitland. Greetings, Captain Halstead. Greetings, Madam Tyse. The Space Conglomeration extends our warmest gratitude and admiration for the wonderful job you and your crew are performing. Thanks to your service, space is safe for exploration and colonization. Thank you, Madam Tyse. I do have some concerns. Please, continues. The long time in space is taking its toll on the crew and on me. We're also down to our last destroyer missile and after we nuke another black hole, we will be out of armaments. Then I see no reason why you can't return to Aquarius for an extended break and a bonus. You are too kind, Madam Tyse, It's the least we can do, and drinks at my tower once you land? That might go against corporation policy. Not when I'm calling shots, Captain. I might be able to manage some time on reentry. That's what I like about you, Captain. You're always so accommodating. Damn, would you get a load of that? That's the largest black hole I've ever seen. By my calculations the largest one on record. Either way Jacowitz's warhead imploded. Hey Jacowitz, check out your monitor. I see it, but I don't believe my eyes. I can't wait to shove this bomb buster down its throat. Hey Captain, you better to get to the bridge. Looks like we can finally dust off this missile. What is it, guys? Look at that. She's a beauty. You ain't kidding. Shall we nuke it now? Why not? Jacowitz, lock your coordinates on 2517, full thrust. Locked and ready. Awaiting your order. On my command. In five, four, three, two. Captain, recall the launch. Why? There's something else out there. Your circuits are fried. Bringing it up on the main monitor now. Cancel the launch. We have an issue. Yes, sir. Why is that? Space debris from some kind of derelict ship? My scans show no known vessel in the Aquarius quadrant it could belong to. I've never seen anything like it. Vox, scan it for any form of life, even bodies. Yes, sir. Are you okay? I don't know, something about that object it just gives me a scared feeling. Vox, any info on its origin? Captain, it is made of a plant-based material processed and compressed, some metal and- And? some type of life form. Nothing could survive in that, whatever that is. That's what my bio scan states. There's something else. A high energy field. It's probably coming from the black hole. No, something else. What was that? Energy shock wave. From what, Vox? From that. Well, this is turning into a wonderful day. Derelict ships and space symbols. You know, I had a friend that had a tattoo. It looked just like that. Database scan shows it is an ancient symbol representing evil, a pentagram. Space law dictates we have to investigate the derelict. We can't blow up a black hole unless we rescue any survivors, find out exactly what that is. I'll ready the med lab. I'll volunteer, Captain. I can't do much till we clear this up. I need you here in case we have to launch a retaliatory strike against the pentagram. Change your coordinates and lock in on it. You think it's dangerous? Could be a space anomaly, but let's just be safe. Send Vox, I mean, if there's something sinister on board, he's easy to repair if we're attacked. Thank you for your concern. Sure thing, Vox. Vox, get down to the transport. Maitland lock in on the object's coordinates for transfer. Sure thing, Captain. Vox, let me know when you're prepped. Yes, Captain Halstead. I thought we were going home. What was that? Oh, nothing. Just thinking out loud. Whatever you are, I sense your presence. What was that? I am ready, Captain. All right, transfer beginning now. Transfer in progress. I wonder what he'll find. Hopefully, nothing. Make sure his onboard camera is on screen and recording for the duration. Oh, you're just in time. Show's about to begin. Vox should be on board momentarily. Halstead, I just felt a presence in the halls where I saw nothing, and then in the med lab, I was- I was attacked by a tentacle monster. It was strange and then it was just gone. What? The spooky stuff must be getting on your nerves. Let's figure this out one step at a time. Sure. Transfer in three, two, one, complete. Onboard and safe. Pan the camera around so we can get a good look. That's not a space ship. That looks like a- a primitive living quarters. Are your readings picking anything up? Yes, oxygen. That's impossible. You need to be re-calibrated, Vox. That's what my sensors are reading. I am not programmed to exaggerate. That's enough, both of you. Vox, keep exploring. We're watching you on the monitor. Yes, sir. Identify yourself. Say that again, Vox? Did you say "identify yourself"? Affirmative, humanoid figure standing two meters away. We see nothing on the monitor. Must be a malfunction. Negative. What is this place? You are in Aquarius system, Regula. He's malfunctioning. Space pressure must be affecting his sensors. Vox, with whom are you conversing? Unidentified humanoid. What is your name? We are Legion. Legion? Does not compute. Vox, we still can't see who you are conversing with. Please describe. Tall, dark, garbed in black. Vox. Vox, your image capture is damaged. What's going on? Vox. We lost him. I'm not even getting a sensor reading from his functions. Looks like we're going on a rescue mission. Are you kidding? He's not one of us. He's a bot. Let's just blow that structure outta the stars. Vox is one of us. Maitland, you stay at the helm to transport us there and back. Jacowitz, stay at the ready in case we have to nuke all this madness. Yes, sir. Sure, Captain. Let's go, Nurmi. Transport three, two, one, activate. I've got a bad feeling about this. You have a bad feeling about everything. Are you okay? Affirmative. Maitland, we made it stay put and stay frosty. I'm at the ready, good luck. This place, so strange. But what a view. Not very comfortable. Check out this monitor. This looks like a nutrition center. We use this in the ship of some kind. What? I thought I saw hand scuttle that way. Poor thing. What could have done something like this to him? Well, he didn't disintegrate. There's no electrical residue on him. Looks like something tore him to pieces. What is it, Nurmi? Nurmi, Nurmi. Answer me. That's an order. Nurmi. In there. Calm down. It's okay, you're all right. What happened? Who is he? Don't you remember? You walked up here, you found him. I remember leaning over Vox and then I woke up here. Strange, very strange. Maitland, transport us back. We're bringing a guest. What? You heard me. We found a humanoid, Vox is gone. Well? Well what? Is he dead? No, not quite. I'm getting life signals, but nothing definitive. I think he holds the key to all this craziness. What makes you say that? Just a hunch. I could be wrong, but it would seem that he's in a state of suspended animation. Keep me updated on his progress. Yeah, I will. I'll keep an eye on him. Thanks. I have to report this to Madam Tyse. A giant black hole, a fiery pentagram, a strange craft and a derelict humanoid in suspended animation? Captain, you've had a hell of a day. Are you sure you're not to avoid coming back so you can break our date? Trust me, that's not the case. We've never come across anything like this in space before. All this, it can't be a coincidence. Madam Tyse, I think there's something more sinister at play here. Do you think you're in danger? I'm not sure. It's just a feeling. We can't operate on feelings, Captain, only facts. Send me all the data you have on the abnormalities and we'll run a check to see if we find anything. Yes, Madam Tyse. In the meantime, sit tight. Black hole, the pentagram, and the derelict ship aren't going anywhere anytime soon. Report back to me if you have any new information. Tyse out. No. No, in God's name, no. Halstead, we have an emergency. What is it? The humanoid has escaped. He's loose on the ship. Hey pal, what do you think you're doing? Who the hell are you? Whoa. All right, I stopped it. You okay? Ye- yeah, damn, how did he even know the launch sequence? Well, someone better keep a better eye on him or we're all gonna end up atomized. There are so many other places to rule unheard. I'm sorry for the trouble I caused. Where am I? We'll ask the questions, thank you. They better be the right answers or I'm going to melt your face off with this laser pistol. Easy, Maitland. Why don't you and Jacowitz get back on duty? What, we can't interrogate this fool too? That's a Captain's job. Beat it. Sure, Captain. You tried to kill an officer and launch a warhead at the structure we found you in. That's punishable by death in several star systems. Star systems? I'm from earth. Earth. That was, uh, that was in the prime galaxies. It was destroyed by an imploding sun, hundreds of years ago. That's simply not possible. I am Father Benna from earth. The year 2021. The year is 3015. You are millions of light years away from the location that Earth once was. We found you on the structure and we brought you here. Start from the beginning. You said your name's Father Benna. What title is that? A priest, a holy person, a man of God. Part of the ancient religions, believing in a one true God, heaven, hell. That sort of thing. We are going to need God's help, even here in the outer reaches of space. Be more specific. The place you found me, it's a house, not a spaceship. You see on earth, an evil destructive force plagued the earth. It was my mission to defeat it. That house was the epicenter. I made one last ditch effort to stop it. The evil took my hand. I begged God to assist and we were suddenly whisked into the heavens. We ended up here. Ravings of a lunatic. Believe what you want, but we are in great danger. The signs are already here. The signs. The signs in the stars like that pentagram? Yes, yes. And the presence on the ship. What presence? Stand down. All right, I'm sorry. But if what you say, Miss, is true. It's already beginning again. What, what is beginning? The destruction of you and everything in your known galaxies. It won't stop until it destroys everything with its vile touch. What if he says is true? You don't actually believe his nonsense, do you? I'm just saying there's something going on here we know nothing about. That house, the pentagram. Its- there's something happening. W- why can't it be evil? 20th century fairy tales. What's going on is a series of coincidences that we'll figure out in a logical way. Meanwhile, Father Benna, we're going to lock you up for safekeeping. Sit tight for a while. Someone will bring you nourishment later and behave. I wouldn't want to jettison you out into space. So it begins again. This time I'll finish it. How is he? Resting in his detainment cell. We're gonna need his help. You know that. Just hope he's willing to give it. I'm not sure of anything anymore. All of us, including you have been on a 48 hour rotation. We need rest. In Vox's absence we'll take turns on the bridge. Are we going home? Sure, we are. Hello, Halstead. What is your progress rep? You're not Halstead. Who are you? A new vessel in the new world. What the fu- W- Where am I? Who are you? How did I get here? Let me go. I will not restrain you. No. No, make it stop. What the fuck. Hello? Where is everybody? I don't know how I got here. You stay away. You're crazy. I only need your help. I seem to have misplaced my hand. It's painful, you know. Damn you, die already. No, get it off me. Get it off me. Suicide is a sin. Get it off me. What the- what the hell just happened? Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. What are you doing? Let go go. Welcome to hell. I think someone has a doctor's appointment. Please, stop this. No, what are you doing? Wh- why? Why? Because I want to. No. Stay away. Stay away. No, no, stay away. Stay away. Stay away. Stay away. What? How did I get here? What the hell? Exactly, hell. Who are you? I go by many names, none of which you would recognize. I am, shall we say, malevolent. What that little man, Benna, has told you is true. He is a warrior of the light but even in his finest hour, his light could not pierce the darkness that I bore. His own God forsake him and banished us both here. Somewhere far, far away. A place where God has no meaning or purpose. All the more for evil to win. But there is goodness. That is light. That is simply not enough. Hundreds of years have past, but it was a mere blink of an eye for me. I have been alive since the creation. Creation of what? Of everything. I sat on the right side of the creator. I watched it all. All the air, all the new, all he rule. He banished me to dark place and since then we wage war in humans for our cause. Do you like to play games, Captain Halstead? No, especially when others' lives are at risk. Right now, you only need worry about your own life. No, it's burning. We meet again. Yes. I'm afraid it's over for you, but you are a worthy opponent. It is not over. It is never over. The war between good and evil continues here, now. We are proof of that. Think about it, Benna. Your world is gone. Your faith is gone. Your God is gone. In this place, it does not exist, therefore it is over. And I suppose that it's your plan? Plan? My dear Benna, what do you refer to? You know what I'm talking about. I know you see this new world as a place to reign supreme. Yes, it did cross my mind. These people are like your kind eons ago. Weak, without belief, easily led like sheep. I won't let you do that. Not here, not now. No one believes in you. The fight is over. Join me, you can sit on my right side. Wouldn't that be ironic? Never, never in eternity would I do that. Eternity is all I have, Benna. What do you have? A mere 30 years left if you are lucky. You won't be around to witness my conquering of the cosmos. Then all hope is lost. Now you see the light, no pun intended. The pentagram, what does that mean here, now, in this time? It is a sign to those who are already receptive to a whole new change. This was foretold in a different book than your Bible. A black prophesy for these times. All will speak of the glowing red star that ushered in a cosmic change for all time. Your cross, your pious symbol, is gone with your hand. Oh Lord, why have you forsaken me? Captain Halstead, you look distraught. Is there a problem? Some very strange things are happening here. I think the person we found in the derelict may be a harbinger of evil. What? Do you need to be relieved of your command? What nonsense is this? Explain. I can't, not yet. I'm putting the pieces together. Give me some time. I'm afraid time is something you don't have. What's that supposed to mean? I spoke with the high council after you sent the information on the derelict. You are to tow it back to Aquarius immediately. What? What for? Because they feel it is of some significance and should be studied by our learned elders. No, that's a mistake. I think we should shove it into the black hole and obliterate them both. You'll do no such thing. You'll bring it back to Aquarius as requested and forget about the black hole for now. It poses no immediate threat. And the pentagram, what do the elders think of that? They have determined it is nothing more than a cosmic anomaly and it will burn itself out soon. I disagree with you and the council on every count. I don't care what you think. If you deviate from your orders, I have the authority to blow you from the sky. Is that clear? Very clear. Good, now get back to work. Things just keep getting better and better. This is Captain Halstead. I'm calling an emergency meeting on the bridge immediately. Out. Come with me. We need to talk. Captain, there's some weird shit going on here. Yeah, weirder than the other shit. Why is he out of containment? Because I believe him and he can help. Why the change of heart? You've all seen visions. Hallucinations that shook you to your core. You're not kidding. Another thing, Madam Tyse, she summoned me on the telecom and she looked different, unnatural. What did she say? She wants us to forget about the black hole and bring the house and the derelict ship back to Aquarius. That bitch is off her rocker. We need to nuke that black hole. She has fallen under the influence of the evil one. That house must be destroyed. No questions. If not, the evil will spread across this galaxy like a plague. Don't you see? The house is its life source for whatever reason. All right, we need to plan. We can't waste the missile on the house. We can destroy the house from within. Thermal charges planted by us and then detonated once we transport back. No, that's too risky. The evil, once we are at the house, it'll know we're there. Then what? I can go and act as a deterrent. Okay. So we go to the house, we set the charges, we blow up the house when we get back and then we nuke the black hole. Guess we're not getting that overtime pay, huh. Please be warned, the evil one knows what scares you. It will use every trick in its book to stop us. Deception, doubt and fear are its weapon. Right. Right, well, that's your department. Just watch our backs. Don't worry, we've got a score to settle and I not finished yet. Looks like it did a number on you the last time. Your hand. Oh, yes, well, this bite is from the soul. Remember that when that vision twist your head off. All right, let's go. Captain Halstead, answer immediately. The council and I need to have a word with you to make sure our instructions are being followed. Uh, sorry, we're having a problem with reception. Good luck, everyone. We'll need it. I guess that's what dying and crossing over feels like. You get used to it after a few transports. Set at 180. Mm. What is it, Benna? I thought I saw something. Nevermind, it was nothing. Stay focused. We don't need to be wasting our time chasing ghosts. All right, big guy. Ready to kick another black hole in the ass? Where is Captain Halsted? I need to speak with him immediately. I am sending a detachment to your vessels to take over operations. You and your crew are to stand down. But he's a- already.. He's doing what? I- I, um? Stop stalling. He- he's? Yes? He's preparing to destroy the house. I see. Well, there's something you can do. This changes everything. Done with missile prep already? What goes here? Put that blaster down. Maitland, transport us back. Maitland, this is Halstead. Beam us back immediately. Something's wrong. Get it off, get it off, get it off. Blast it. Thanks for lending me a hand. Very funny. What was that? Fire. Up that way. Brace the door. Captain. Jacowitz, where's Maitland? We have a situation here and we need transportation immediately. I'm afraid I can't do that, Captain. Madam Tyse gave me strict orders to stand down. Don't listen to her, you fool. She's sending a new team to handle the situation. Sit tight. It's no use, he's corrupted by it. I'll deal with you later. What are we gonna do? It's gonna rip us apart. I'll handle this. Foul spirit, go back to whence you came. The power of God commands you. Just a little something from the good old days. We could have used that a little sooner. What are we gonna do? We need to get back to the ship. Sit tight. What's that? You have a photon decelerator? What's that? It relocates molecular structures and moves them across a light beam. What's that? We can get back to the ship manually. Why didn't you say so? All right, here we go. Let's hope this works. Good work. We did it. Now what do we do? Your crew man Jacowitz is running around this ship possessed. First thing's first. We need to get to the bridge and detonate the bomb. No. Don't fight it, it's not use. Hey. No, no. Where's Jacowitz. Damn, I bet he's headed to launch the missile. We gotta stop him. The evil wasn't destroyed. Still here. Step away from the console. Too late, Captain. The launch sequence has been started and can't be stopped. You lose. What? He was asking for it. We can't stop the warhead from firing. But you can alter its direction. Yes, we can accomplish that. Good, do it. Wait, where are you going? This is where our paths end. Good luck and godspeed. - Wait. - He knows what he must do. Come, let's change the direction of that missile. We did it. We did it. What is it? Ship's engines have failed. Blast must have taken them out. So we're just adrift. We just have to wait until new ship comes to get us. There isn't enough time. We'll be? We'll be pulled into the black hole before anybody comes to get us. Yes. I'm sorry. There's nothing more we can do. Yes, there is. What? Pray. Halstead, listen carefully. I'm going to lure the evil into the transport. When I give the word direct us into space. Okay, good luck, Benna. No, no, you will not win. Now, Halstead. Ready the laser cannon. Do it. Welcome home, Father Benna. Good job. Where do you think they went? Home. Where do you think we're gonna go once we get sucked in? Beyond today and past tomorrow. Madam Tyse, we've arrived at the location and nothing remains except the black hole. No traces of anything? No derelict structure, no pentagram and no Wyoming 227. Very well, you may return to Aquarius. Would you like us to make another sweep? That won't be necessary. Everything has gone to plan.
