There's a time when the operation of the machine becomes so odious, makes you so sick at heart that you can't take part. You can't even passively take part, and you've got to put your bodies upon the gears and upon the wheels, upon the levers, upon all the apparatus, and you've got to make it stop! ♪ First, let me start by saying Mario Savio's. "Operation of the Machine" is one of my favorite speeches of all time. Mario wasn't a politician or some famous Hollywood star. He was just a student who was for civil rights. He stood on a car at Berkley and screamed whatever came into his head. He didn't care that he had a stuttering problem or that he might get thrown out of school, which he did. He just wanted his voice to be heard and be unencumbered by the machine. As an investigative writer that has yet to be officially published, I can relate to Mario's desire. That's me behind the wheel, Jay Bahadur, proud college graduate of the class of 2007, arguably the worst year since the Great Depression to graduate school, but timing was never my strength. In fact, good timing seems to be at odds with my very existence, but like many unpleasantries in life, you just learn to deal with it. - Afternoon, shoppers... - Yo. Hey, man. Is Mark Reiss here? - Reissy? Oh, he left. - Shit, really? - Yeah. - Damn it, he was supposed to be here. It's kind of lousy out, if you didn't notice. He left early. Are you interviewing for stock boy or... Me? No. My name is Jay Bahadur. I'm doing market research on premium napkins. Mind if I ask you a few questions? - Your name isn't even on here. - I assure you, I am legit. You drove all the way from Toronto to ask questions about napkins? - Premium napkins. - Thought my job sucked. Could you show your paper product aisle? But I'm just kind of busy. Is there a reason why the six. ...reason why the six pack. This thing does not like me. Is there a reason why the six pack paisley napkins are here and not here? It's not a trick question. I... I think because it was just easier putting them on the floor than on the top shelf. And would making our packaging more festive make you consider moving the premium napkins to the top shelf? You're probably thinking that a person with my intellectual capacity would loathe waiting for that gentleman's answer to my question. But actually, I feel quite the contrary. I would just leave them on the bottom shelf, man. It's less work. Less work. Understanding what drives a mind to react the way it does to things never ceases to amaze me. My careful documentation of this one man's opinion could, in its own way, reshape the patterns of napkins on every home on this street, including that one, my ex-high school girlfriend, Tracy Zicconi's house. The darkened second-floor window just a reminder that she now resides 1,825 miles away at Stanford. And I know it's 1,825 miles away because I have an obsession with Google Maps, not with my ex-high school girlfriend. I was raised as a non-practicing Hindu-Christian half-Indian living at this address. This is the home of Kailash and Maria Bahadur. My well-laid-out graduation plan was only to visit my former residence on festive holidays such as Canadian Thanksgiving and Christmas, perhaps offering my skills at turkey basting or tree trimming, but this was 2008. Plans evaporated. Upon my graduation from the esteemed University of Toronto, my parents had decided to give me my own mailbox. They saw it as a way in which to somehow legitimize my residence in their basement. The funny thing was that the mailman refused to deliver my mail there, so Mom would sort the mail and deliver it herself after each delivery. "Dear Mr. Bahadur, the editorial staff "at 'Vanity Fair' has reviewed your story submission, "and we unfortunately do not feel "it's something we would like our magazine "to pursue at this time. We wish you the best of luck at other publications... ". Blah fucking blah. Why do all rejection letters have the word "unfortunately" in the first sentence? Surely there is a more original adverb to toss in there. I vow that I will never write for a publication that uses the word "unfortunately" in their first sentence. I am better than that. Come on. Jared? Jared? Jared. Is that my Red Bull? No. Look at me. Mom says you got to shovel the snow in the driveway so Dad can get in. - Me? - Mm-hmm. - You're not doing anything. - Doing homework. - Uh, where's mom? - The elusive pink fairy armadillo has been known to... Mom? Mom? Yeah? Why do I have to shovel the driveway? Your father and I discussed this with you, Jay, about ways for you to contribute rent, remember? And I'm so sorry about your rejection letter. Ahh! - Yo! - Ahh! Are you, like, earning some extra allowance or something? I'm starting to wonder why I didn't commit teen suicide when I could. Amen. Yo, bro, you want to, like, hit Parrots with us? Can't. I got to submit my research numbers. They got to be in Chicago by tomorrow. - Then fake it. - I can't, man. They figure out all sorts of stuff based off my results. - Like what? - Like what holiday paisleys are popular and stuff. Okay, bro, you lost me. Journalistic integrity, it's gonna be worth something on the resume when I apply to Harvard's journalism school. - Right, right. - Hey, I got an idea for a story I'm gonna submit. It came to me when I was listening to CBC Radio today. What's... what's the angle? The end of the comedic dictator. Kim Jong is on his death bed, and once he goes, where's the dictator comedy gonna come from? Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. He's funny and very alive. He's not funny. He's a little funny. He's a little funny, but no one can pronounce his name. Your story is flawed, bro. You guys want to hear something fucked up? Tracy's getting engaged. - Where did you hear that shit? - Mm, Kate. She said she saw it posted on Facebook. She's gonna marry her Lit professor. No way. Tracy is repulsed by older men. You were older. Two years is not older, man! It's a little bit older. Fuck you, Crowe. Hey, are you sure you don't want to hit Parrots with us? No, dude, I got to... Do some shit nobody gives a fuck about? Exactly. All right, well, that is your loss, but if you change your mind, please hit us up. - You got it. Later, dudes. - See you, buddy. See you. - Fucking moron. - What? Ahh! Ahh! Name's Bahadur, here to see Dr. Fleshman about my back. Have you ever been here before? - No. - All right, you'll just need to fill out these forms. Right. You okay? Yeah, I just hurt my back, figured I'd get a jump on being a senior citizen. So, you busting on grey hairs? To make a move on Kaitlyn, eh? Excuse me? That's all right, I understand. I'd take down all of humanity just to bang her. - Seymour. - Ooh. I was just talking. I'm trying to keep it a level playing field. - Yeah, leave him alone. - You know what I'm saying. Sorry. What happened to your back? - Sh-shoveling. - Shoveling? - Yeah. - I got, uh, shrapnel moving around the vertebrae. It's a bitch. Well, sounds like I got the better end of the deal in here. Oh, bullshit. Shoveling? I hate shoveling. Pointless waste of time, no? Name's Seymour Tolbin. - Ah. - Oh, oh, sorry. - Wait, Seymour Tolbin? - Yeah. The... who writes for "The Daily Mail?" Wrote. I'm retired, sort of. But that's right. That's me. Holy fuck. You are one of my favorite journalists of all time. Come on. You Facebook people have favorite journalists? You were one of the first reporters who had the guts to report the Battle of Ong Thanh as a loss. That's... So you're a journalist? No. Well, I mean, yeah, I want to be, but I can't... I just... you know, I haven't taken a... I never took a class, but I'm seriously... I'm thinking about going back to get a degree. Harvard is the... is the goal. Oh, how can you say something stupid like that? - What... - Why do you think journalism is a pile of "People" magazine, "She got cellulite on her Dumpster" crap right now? Journalism isn't taught. It's innate. You know what I'm saying? You think the shrapnel in my back landed there because I was using my head? No way. - So what are you saying? - I'm saying fuck Harvard, is what I'm saying. Fuck Harvard. You want to make it as some big swinging dick journalist? You got to go somewhere fucking crazy. Somewhere where Western reporters would consider it too dangerous to go, like, write as a stringer from there, get a book going. It's the only way out. Yeah, that makes sense, man. That makes sense. Where you thinking of going? Somalia. Hmm? Like, I-I bought a... An umbrella from a Somali once. What does that mean? That means where's the fucking conflict, besides the fact that they machete reporters to death? In Somalia the seeds of democracy are growing amidst anarchy. I did a paper on it my freshman year. So? So it's a misunderstood place. Bro, democracy is not topical, all right? No... nobody wants to understand Somalia. Did you know in Somaliland they held an election where the minority clan won the presidential office by 80 votes, and there was no violence? The transition of power was peaceful. It was peaceful because nobody bothered reporting on it. You need to listen to me. You want conflict? You want to tell the story from both sides? Go to Sudan. There's your ticket, not Somalia. I don't know, man. I got a good grade on that paper. Somalia and me are copacetic. Is a Mr. Trey Williamson here? - Just left. - Shit, really? My name is, uh, Jay Bahadur. I'm here to conduct a marketing research... Who's the guy eating Doritos on my aisle? That's my associate, Mr. Felcher. - I have to clean that shit up. - I'm so sorry, man. - Would you please... - Continue maestro. Refrain from eating in this poor man's aisle? And just start to pick that up. - I got it. - Thank you. I got it. And where is your, uh, napkin aisle? - Aisle seven. - Seven. Hey, uh, Jay? I think you should check this shit out. I thought we agreed you would be silent, bro. No, bro, I really think you should check this out. Would you excuse me for a moment? Thank you. What the fuck, man? The rebels, who Kenyan officials liken to seagoing pirates have taken captive the MV Faina, a Ukrainian vessel, off the Somali coast, and they're demanding an untold ransom. Our correspondent, Mitch Kelp, has more on the story from outside the U.S. embassy in Nairobi. Mitch, what more can you tell us? Well, Chrissy, not a whole lot. We are going off an official press release from the Kenyan government. We don't have a single source in Somalia, and I'm sure as shit not gonna get my ass shot over there trying to find out what would possess these, um... Possess these crackheads to take an unarmed tanker. Hmm. Well, Mitch, word here is our corporate insurance policy wouldn't cover you in that hellhole, and they'd hate to have a lawsuit from your family on their hands when they mail you back in pieces. Thank corporate for being so considerate, Chrissy. Back to you. So until we can find one crazy motherfucker to head over to Somalia and find out what's going on, we'll continue to take uneducated guesses as to who these pirates are. Bahadur, answer the phone! And you've got to put your bodies upon the gears and upon the wheels... Hello? Hello? Is this Mr. Jay Bahadur? - Yeah. - This is Mohamad Farole from Radio Garowe over in Somalia. I got your email. So you are wanting to come to Somalia for a book. You are writing on the pirates, and you're looking for people to talk to here, right? - Yes, exactly. - I must say that is more than any other reporter has been willing to do. You are the first Westerner to actually ask to come see what's going on here. - That's unfortunate. - Yes, yes, it's true. I'll have a conversation with my father, accommodate your request. Okay, okay. And, uh, how... uh, you think your father will be able to make this happen? I would hope so. He is our president. - Assalamu alaikum. - Uhh. That's Somali for hello. I suggest you learn it, Bahadur. I'm out of cigars. Want to walk with me? Okay. Yeah, this guy Farole called. I just sent out some feelers to a few Somali news services, and boom. The president's son calls you back. Yes! I never get a break like that, never. Well, uh, you create your own reality, chief. Well, if that was true, we would all live in a solipsistic universe wherein we could do whatever we wanted without any further consequences. What the fuck are you talking about? Michael Topper, author of "Channeling UFOs" and "The Positive/Negative Realms Beyond This World?" You read too much. Fuck more girls, instead. Speaking of which, I read that writing sample you gave me. Bad? Why the fuck would you write a piece on how to get away without paying parking tickets? - I thought people would laugh. - Laugh? Parking tickets pay for the roads. The roads get you out of this shit hole. - So you hated it? - No, actually. I liked it. It's not the second coming of Hunter S. Thompson, but you write with a good conscience. - You think? - Yeah. Don't let it go to your head. Bravo. So Avril Benoit, you know who she is? Yeah, uh, she's on CBC Radio. She did a great report on Kenya a few weeks ago. Exactly. She's a friend of mine, uh, and I want to put you in contact with her. Okay. She's a good one for feeding pages to. So you got... you got a book outline? - No. - Wrong. You're formulating one, okay? I haven't. I mean, this is all happening so fast. I just... I Googled "Somalia press," found Farole's name, and sent out a blind email. I had no idea this was gonna blow up, none. Bahadur, you got a book outline? No! That's what I'm trying to tell you... Stop! Try again. You got a book outline? I'm formulating it. I knew you'd get it on the third try. Come on, let's go. So how much do you know about Somalia? Uh, well, I did a term paper on it my freshman year at university, so. That's good. Don't tell me the grade. It's a start. Immerse yourself in it. You dig cigars? I never understood cigars. That's clever, don't you think, Jo? Okay. Save this. By the time this thing is over, you will. Jo, thank you. What else don't you understand? I need to know that. The Jays are going to lose Burnett to the Yanks. They offered him 82.5 million over five years. Can you believe that? I have an announcement. - What kind of announcement? - Yes, what kind? Uh, I'm gonna go to Somalia and write a book on the pirates, try to get some stories published. - Somalia? - I know what you're thinking. I know you're thinking it's batshit crazy, but I think this is the only way for me to become a journalist. - AIDS. - AIDS? - Isn't that a problem there? - I believe so, but I'm going to write about the pirates, Dad, not sleep with them. Excuse me, it's my Somali contact. Assalamu alaikum. Shifted? He needs to do more yoga. His shoulders are bad. Assalam... ciao. - You okay, sweetheart? - Yeah, I'm okay. I was wrong though. - Wrong? - Yeah, apparently there's an additional $500 security deposit I didn't account for. - 500? - Security deposit? Yeah, just for, you know... You know, for, like, uh, vehicles and such, insurance policies, things like that. Can I borrow $500? Welcome about flight 823 now departing for Frankfurt. At this time we'd like you to put away all your electronic devices... Excuse me, sir. All cell phones must be off. It's just final words to my ex-girlfriend before I had to Somalia. I'm, uh, basically looking for a little sympathy, maybe a wow. Personally, between me and you, I'd settle for an LOL. - Off, please. - Right, right, sorry. I want to take a moment now to say that not all the characters in this film are exactly like they are in real life, except for that stewardess. I felt she needed to be depicted completely accurately in her total lack of empathy for my pain. Thankfully I only had to spend the next eight hours of my journey with her, and then I'd get a new stewardess, and then another stewardess, and then another. In fact, I might have set a connecting flight record to Somalia, but see, this was all part of my master plan, a fixed budget that would allow me to write my book, and unlike several of my predecessors who ventured to where that flag is, I'd say alive, as kidnapping and killing journalists had become an unfortunate trend here. Dude. Fuck! Stop! Stop the fucking... Seymour? Tracy? I thought you were repulsed by older men! - Please calm down! - Make out with me! Make out with me now! Ahh! Believe it or not, that is what I consider a mild Tracy nightmare. Sorry, sorry, man. In order to clear my mind of its negativity, I'll take a moment now to focus on the less fortunate than myself, the people of Somalia. Hard to believe this land was once known as a nation of poets. Throughout their history, the Somali poet was counted on to defend a clan's honor. They used poems of persuasion in lieu of weapons to settle disputes, but in the 20th century times changed. Both the English and the Italians attempted to colonize them. They introduced guns into battle, and although Somalia valiantly refused to succumb, the scars of war never relented. Somalia's recent civil war had caused over a million people to flee to neighboring countries as refuges. Those who stayed faced droughts, floods, famine, feuding clan battles, and jihad. Their newly-elected President Farole had his hands full, especially when you threw in the pirates. I arrived at my destination city of Galkayo, and into the fire I plunged, or as my Somali translation book said, "Dabka." Holy fuck. - Mr. Bahadur? Mr. Bahadur. - Hi. - Hi, welcome to Galkayo. - Oh, thank you. Yes. I am Abdirizak. You call me Abdi. I am your translator. Cool. Good to meet you. Good to meet you, yes. How was your flight? It was good. That's good. Oh, please don't do the... with your finger here. - This? - Yes. Oh, please... Oh, no, I'm sorry. I didn't know. I'm... I'm so sorry. I... It's offensive. I'll keep the thumbs in check. Thank you. - Yes, yes. - Yeah. Your English is great. It's not perfect. I try to learn from you during your stay, Mr. Bahadur. - Oh, please call me Jay. - Jay? Yeah, Jay. - Jay, you have one bag? - Yeah, one bag. Oh, you're like Obama, a man that knows what he wants. You know Obama? Of course. He will be great leader for your people. Oh, I'm Canadian. He's... he's not my leader. Of course he is. Your people just don't know it. Come. ♪ ♪ So I hear you are an author and journalist. - Yes. - Good, good. There is so much to write about in this country. What is your subject? In a perfect world I'd be writing about your newfound democracy, but, um, given the fact that the West has broken off all relations with you, um, I'm here to write about your pirates. - You mean badaadinta badah? - Bada-binda-bada? What is that? It means saviors of the sea. They are like Coast Guard. You can never call them pirates. Okay. That's good to know. They have very strong opinion on this, never pirates. - Are they easy to find? - Yes, of course. They are people with crazy money. So they walk freely? Yes, but our new President Farole has promised to change this. He is a very tough man who will bring much change. Ah! - Is everything okay? - Yes, yes. It's okay? Yes, yes. Sometimes I feel like father with little children. They need khat. - Khat. - Yes. We must stop up here. In Somalia one hour and already shooting my first drug deal, my kind of country. So khat is a drug? Yes, it's... it's a stimulant leaf from Kenya and Ethiopia. It's very addictive, big problem here. What's he saying? He wants to know if you want to buy some. Oh, no, I... I... sorry, I'm on a very fixed budget. I didn't account for drug money. I don't have any... He wants you to try it. It won't kill you. Yes, just bite down. What's the effects? Makes some people want to have sex, others very talkative. Ugh! Tracy was a great girl, but, you know, she... what... what are you gonna do? She moves on. I move on. I really doubt we'll ever even talk again. I mean, why bother, right? Seems like a waste of time. I mean, it's just gonna confuse thing and make it more difficult. Men and women can't be friends. Exactly! Exactly, that's the same over here? Yes, it's a universal thought. See, where I come from, they debate it. They debate it like morons, like idiots. It's not a debate. It's fact. We're reaching a checkpoint. Please stay calm. Ah, Mr. Bahadur.. - Hi. - So we finally meet face to face, huh? Yes, nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, sir. Abdi. You are younger than I pictured, somewhat. - Ah. - Western reporters to me are always so fucking unhappy. Well, I get even better once I shower. Come on, come on. Has Abdi been good to you? Yes, mad good, yeah. He's the best translator in all of Puntland, you know? - Oh, no, really? - Yeah. We stole him from the pirates. Oh, you mean, uh, badaadinta badah? Abdi, did you teach him this? - Ah... - This is not our Coast Guard, Abdi, they are pirates! You must forget the old guard's thinking. They are pirates! Pirates. - Mr. Jay. - Hi. So what do you think of the Radio Garowe newsroom? Nice. Does it look like the ones in Canada? Yes. Yes, it does, a bit, yeah. It's amazing, huh? - Is it a local station or, um... - Oh, one minute. - Okay. Okay. - Yeah, mostly it's local, but, you know, the guy is very famous. He used to work for... This guy, famous? That was my father's office. He wants to meet us now. Your father? The... the president? Yeah, we must go now. Fuck. Pirates are not the most cooperative group to deal with. - Mm-hmm. - Look here. The main pirates' clan are dotted around here. - Eyl. - You know Eyl? Yeah, that's where they took the Farhina and held it for six months. Precisely. Eyl is a fishing town where they started. I'm working on getting you a meeting with Boyah. - Boyah? - Yes, he's a man Somali calls Robin Hood. - Robin Hood of the pirates? - But it could take some time. - How much time? - Days, maybe weeks. Is that a problem? - No. No, no, that's fine. - No? - That's totally fine, yeah. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Okay. Yeah, I'll just... I'll call my publisher and make sure it's all set, finances, extending it, and everything. My father just got in here a couple weeks ago. The transition of government was entirely peaceful. This is the reporter, Jay Bahadur. It's an honor to meet you, Your Excellency. Welcome, Mr. Bahadur. So my son tells me you're the next Mr. Bob Woodward. - I'm not so sure about that. - Why aren't you sure? You have made it farther into Somalia than any of your Western counterparts. With all due respect, uh, I've always considered myself more of a Bernstein than a Woodward. Bernstein was ugly as hell and never got through college. Overcame his shortcomings. Uh, I find that admirable. - He's a funny guy. - Very funny. I would like to introduce you to Colonel Omar, who'll be the head of your security team during your stay. - Welcome. - Pleasure to meet you, Colonel. I'll protect you well, Mr. Bahadur. You're welcome. - You have learned some Somali? - Enough to be a bad tourist. Um, is this okay? Of course. That's why you're here. My family and I spent our last eight years in Australia... Is there a reason the six pack paisley napk... are... - And we... - Not here? Sorry. I'm so sorry, Your Excellency. I'm just, uh... I think because it was just... Trying to get this dang thing working here. Festive... festive... Good to go. The people of Somalia asked me to come back here and to run for this office. I never saw myself being the president. I am a businessman. I am not a warrior like my predecessors, but here I am, fighting to bring justice to those who destroy our country. Have you seen a school since you've come here, Mr. Bahadur? Uh, no, I must admit I haven't. We have the fewest schools in the African nations. Do you know how hard it is to rule here with a PhD knowing the children I lead have no chance for an education? Their role models of success are pirates. The Western world thinks we encourage this. This must change. Do you have a title yet? A title? For your future bestselling book. Oh. Um, yes, of course. Um, "Pirates." That's shit title. Just "Pirates?" - "Pirates of Somalia." - Be more creative. Be more creative. Creative? - Yeah. - Creative. - Creative. - Yes, creative, you're right. Jay, you know, my father likes you. - What, you think so? - Yes, yes. All right. He knows you will bring great things here. What if I don't? How can you not when people read your bestseller? Ohh. Abdi, have you found Boyah yet? - Mm. - Oh, you must be patient, man. - Yeah. - He will show up. They're gonna take you to your accommodations. Wow. Thank you, uh, so much for everything. That's the beginning of a better Somalia, Jay. - Yes, I certainly hope so. - Yes. - Yes. - Have a good night. - You too, good night. - Good night. ♪ Welcome, welcome. Yeah. You will be here the next six months. - Great. - Yes. This is my cousin. Hi, Jay. - I'll work on that. - Mm-hmm. - Nice to meet you. - We call him the Yellow Chair. Yellow Chair? Oh, 'cause there's a yellow chair, I get it. - He's a little crazy, yes. - I get it. That's good. Hi. I tell them you're a white ghost. Why the fuck did you do that, man? They've never seen a white man before. It's okay. They are my sister's kids. I live up there. - All right. - Mm. - Third floor? - It's... yes. It's... it's usually very quiet here. Okay, that's great. Although it's... it gets hot from the sun, and thanks to you we are the only people with Internet. - What? - Yes, that alone is worth you being my guest. Thank you. Glad I could be of some service to you. Yes. - Oh, wow, nice. - Nice hall. So yes, I need to advise you, keep that closed. - Really? - The whole time. There are orders from the colonel, Omar. - He's not into sunshine? - He's into keeping you alive. Fair enough. Oh, cute. And yes, uh, we are very sorry, uh, no hot water. Welcome to Somalia, yeah. No worries. I'll make do. Was thinking about growing it out. What do you think? Oh, hair on the face is very popular here. - Yeah? - Yes. - Good. That's great. - Good idea. You have a mosquito net? - I do, definitely. - Good. Malaria is very rampant here, as well as rats, so any valuable, any food, you must keep it inside the box. Cool, just like camp. Well, thanks for everything, Abdi. Yes, uh, welcome. Good night. Anything you need, uh, let me know. Okay, perfect, thank you. Oh, uh, one last thing. Um, I kind of like to work with things taped on the walls. Is that okay? Oh, it's okay, as long as no pornography, eh? - Not a problem. - Because small, little kids come, walk in. Yeah, no. - So... so no... - Please, yeah. - Okay. Bye. - All right. Good night. Bye-bye. Thank you. Night. Can't open the fucking window. ♪ - Ahh! Oh, shit! - Oh, shit! Oh, shit. Oh, shit, oh, shit. Oh, shit. Ugh, rats. Ahh. Garowe, Somalia, December 10, 2008, a view from my room. I've broken security measures and opened my window. Holy shit. Opening the windows? You got a knack for living dangerously, bro. Sorry, man. Totally worth it. That girl was mad hot. Wow. She's... she's one of Garaad's wives. Who's... who's Garaad? Garaad, he's a pirate, and he's, uh, one of the most powerful men in all of Puntland. - Really? - Her name is Maryan. - Maryan. - She sells khat in the market. Mm, whoa, khat dealer? That's where all these pretty girls are going, to sell khat. Is it possible to conduct an interview with her? With her, it's not advisable. - Well, how do we meet Garaad? - Garaad? - Yeah. - No, no, no, no. We are avoiding this guy. - No. Dude, I didn't come... - This guy... No, I didn't come here to avoid. He's dangerous. He's a very dangerous man, so... And Boyah isn't? I mean, come on. Well, you'll find out Boyah. What does that mean? - We're going now. Let's go. - Now? - I set up a meeting, yes, now. - Shit, let's go. Let's go. Okay. ♪ Where's he going? Now me and you meet him under the tree. Come. Okay. Okay. You know those out-of-body experiences where you look around and say, "This shit isn't happening to me?" My only one I could compare it to was when I got pulled over for speeding in Kitchener. Cop asked me to step out of the car 'cause I had a blunt in the ashtray. - What is a blunt? - You know, grass, marijuana. That isn't tolerated in America? I'm Canadian. Sorry, bro, I forget. Well, please don't forget when I get shot here. I want my body sent to the right country. - No one will shoot you. - Maimed, whatever. He wants to know what's your shirt. - My shirt? - Yes. Uh, this is a Blue Jays shirt. It's the, uh, baseball team in Toronto. He wants to know who wears the number 15. 15? Uh, that's my man, Alex Rios. Uh, he's, uh, what you call a five-tool player. No one can touch him in my opinion. He say as Somali people number five is very important. As we pray five times a day, and they say the liar has five religions. Maybe that five explains why Rios is such a monster. All right, uh... So Boyah, um, Westerners call you a, uh... a pirate. He's saying he's not a pirate. He is someone defending his oceans. - Badaadinta badah? - Yes. Yeah. He was a lobster diver from Eyl. The Westerners come, Chinese, the Koreans, uh... And they overfished the waters. So they must pay for their illegal actions. So you attack their fishing vessels. He takes the taxes that the government's supposed to take. That's all he's doing. And they never kill anyone. Never? Yes, he said never, not his men. Who are your merry men? Or men... just say men. It's 500 men based in Eyl. He's the one that gathered them together, and he's also the one that pays them their wages. Wow, impressive. So how do you pick someone worthy of your confederation? First, he must own his own gun. That's why he show you the gun. - Right. - And they must be ready to die. He wants to know if you have khat for him. Khat? No, uh, sorry, I... no, I... wha... What the fuck? What just happened? You were supposed to bring the khat to him!

Um, there's gonna be a moment when you're not on that desk screening calls, and you're gonna need a break, a single tiny break from the assistant on the other end, and that karma is gonna be paid off by giving me a break in this very moment. - You think it gets me a raise? - Definitely.

It is a merely mathematical probability that you will meet the ultimate girl of your dreams in your lifetime. These odds are increased slightly by reckless behavior and naiveté. That is how I met Maryan. Assalamu alaikum Jay. Assalamu alaikum, Maryan. - Yes, I see you in the window. - You speak English. - A little. - Where did you learn? I watch a lot of American movies. Movies? - Yeah. I love. - That makes two of us. - Yes? - Yeah. Uh, got movie posters all over my room. What's your favorite movie? - I like "G.I. Jane." - Really? Yeah. I like Demi Moore. She's a very tough woman. Yeah, especially with that buzz cut. It's super butch. I'm sure Demi Moore would be honored, though, to have a Somali fan club. The movie I think is very wrong is "Black Hawk Down." Because, uh, it's about what went down in Mogadishu? No, because it's about our people, and they do not use a single person from Somalia in it. It is wrong. - I didn't know that. - Yes. "Derka derka Mohammed jihad,." That's what they were doing the whole pathetic film. You just did "Team America." That's crazy. Wow. Yes, "Team America" said many smart things. This conversation is getting surreal. You know this city talks about you? - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. What are they saying? They're saying you're here to expose the truth about the badaadinta badah. - Yeah? - Yeah. Well, I mean, I am trying, but, uh, what do you think about them? I'm not the person to ask. I'm married to one. - Garaad. - So you know? I know, yeah. He's a very powerful man. I'm trying to meet him. Yeah, you and I both want that meeting. You don't see him much? Not since I married him, no. Well, you'd be a better treasure than anything he'd find on one of those ships. That's an American movie line. Yes. Maybe. I don't know. But it's good though, right?

Look, I don't... I don't know if you'd be interested, but I've heard that CBS is willing to pay $1,000 for any video of hostages on the ships. Is this your way of saying it's a dead end with your contacts? No. I know it's crazy and borderline sensationalism, but it can really get you out there. It could help sell this book.

Jay... you are the only reporter willing to risk their life to show the struggle of Somali people. Yes, yes, I know, but you're missing the point. I'm not a reporter, okay? I thought I could come here and get a book deal or publish some stuff once I sent some pages to editors, but they rejected me, man. They fucking rejected me like every other piece of shit I've written! Fuck! Sorry. Sorry. - They rejected your work? - Yeah. If Farole finds out, I'm fucking dead. I'm dead. He's gonna kill me. Perhaps yes, perhaps no. He understands rejection. It's a human trait. I shouldn't have come here, man. I'm a fucking idiot. Don't say that, Jay. Don't say that. You had no choice. Yeah. I came here with the noble idea of exposing the truth, and I lied to everyone around me. You wake me in the middle of the night to tell me this? I came here to ask you a favor. - Ask me. - Yeah, okay. I need you to help me get on a ship and film some hostages. - Jay, that is not wise. - I know it's not wise. I know that, but, you know, this is the only way that people out there are gonna give a fuck about what is going on here. It's the only way. I don't believe that. Dude, CBS is willing to pay $1,000, okay? I'll split it with you if you can get me on a ship. I'll split it with you. That's $500, American dollars. That's fucking great money, man. Jay, it's not about money. Once you're on the ship, we cannot protect you. The president won't even allow this. It's CBS. It's the biggest network. Yes, and your being a famous reporter getting killed, that would seal the fate for Somali people as terrorists. - And I'm not famous. - Jay, you will be.

What makes you say that? You don't think all of Garowe know this? Does Garaad? If he know, you wouldn't be here. That's comforting. He wants me as a translator, so perhaps I trade for the possibility of him and you in a room. Then you're putting yourself in danger. That's... I don't like that. No, no, no, no, mm-mm. That's nonsense, Jay. Why you helping me like this? Why you doing that? You are my bro. I have to help you. - Thanks, man. - Okay?

Can I see your passport? Passport? Follow me, please. - Hello, Mr. Bahadur. - Hello. My name's Agent Brice. I'm with CSIS. Okay. Uh, is... am I in some sort of trouble? Quite the opposite. We're very anxious to learn if you could give us any insight that you may have gained while in Somalia. Wait, you want me to give you insight? Look, uh, both the U.S. and the Canadian intelligence are basically flying blind in the region, so we could use some help. Oh, my God. Wow. Okay. Uh, this... my parents are, uh, doing the circling thing. Right, okay. All right, well, uh, tell you what. Why don't you give me a call when you're settled in? Toronto had stayed perfectly intact despite my absence. I couldn't vouch for the napkin patterns inside each home we drove past, but I had to guess my painstaking research did little to alter the landscape. We don't want to upset you. We did not know how to tell you this. Jared's been living in the basement. What? Well, you've been gone for six months, sweetheart. So, you know, um, he's sleeping because he has exams in the morning, so it's best that you enter through the front door. Can I still use the shower, or are the pipes gonna wake him too? I think tonight we can make an exception. Fuck Harvard! Oh, my God! Fuck Harvard! I've never heard you swear before. Yeah, well, it's true. Fuck 'em. My Jay beat all the odds, and you're gonna win the Pulitzer from writing it in our basement. To Jay and his fucking basement Pulitzer! Yeah! Who's idea was "Fuck Harvard?" Bahadur, you better tell me you got laid at least once over there, or I'm leaving. On second thought, don't tell me. Booze is too good to leave. You guys want to see something really cool? Wow. You should see what he does with the bottle. Would I like mine so... hey, man. What are you mumbling about? Well, I'm just thinking aloud, you know? Okay. I like that. I like that. - So what's next, Bahadur? - Next? What's gonna keep you from spending all your nights in the shadow of those guys? Well, I got a ton of work to do on the book. - After the book? - After? Yeah. Take a look at that. 70-year-old men don't get handed fucking business cards for a reason unless it's a last rites priest. What's it say? - Agent T. Brice, CSIS. - CSIS? - Yeah. - They talked to you? - Yes, they did. - What'd they say? They were anxious to listen to what I learned over there. - Anxious, huh? - Mm-hmm. - Anxious? - Mm-hmm. - Could bring an opportunity. - That's what I think. - Oh. - Hmm? Christ, you haven't smoked this fucker yet? Not yet. I've been tempted though. - You're hopeless. - Give me the fucking thing. - That's Somali? - Yes. - What does it mean? - "Tonight, we drink." Oh, that's good to hear. I thought you were gonna say, "Tonight we fuck." ♪ Please have a seat. Thank you. State your name and work position for the committee. Sure. My name is Jay Bahadur. I'm a Canadian citizen currently living in Nairobi, Kenya. I'm running "The Somalia Report," which is the largest and in fact the only English-language news site devoted to Somalia. Mr. Bahadur, you're considered one of the foremost experts on Somali piracy, are you not? - I have some knowledge, sir. - Some knowledge would be an understatement. Your book on piracy's currently on "The New York Times'" bestseller list, is it not? - Yes, that's true, sir. - In your opinion, what's the most effective way for us to combat this current piracy trend and make shipping lanes safe for our vessels? Well, that's a very general question, sir. Well, your best answer's all we ask, sir. Okay. I know there's a lot of collective knowledge in this room, so I apologize if what I'm about to say is old news to some of you. I did a paper on the subject my freshman year at university, and it just stuck with me. A school paper? - Yes. - Are we gonna hear your grade too? No, sir, that is classified. Um, in 2002 Somaliland held an election where the minority clan won the presidential office by 80 votes, and the transition of power was completely peaceful, no violence, not one shot fired. That doesn't happen anywhere in Africa. That doesn't even happen here. Anyway, it caught my eye and made me start to fall in love with Somalia and ultimately made me go there to find out what made them different. After spending my last five years immersed in their country's struggles, they don't need your warships off their coast. What they need is to be recognized by all of you for the incredibly complex but honorable culture that they are. A fledgling democracy doesn't make headlines like pirates do. You guys wouldn't be sitting here talking to me if I wrote a book on a fledgling democracy. Hell, I couldn't even afford this suit if I wrote a book on a fledgling democracy. All I'm asking is that you guys start to look at Somalia in a different way, not so much as them versus us, but rather look at Somalia as us when we were young. ♪ I've never seen a diamond in the flesh ♪ ♪ I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the movies ♪ ♪ And I'm not proud of my address ♪ ♪ In the torn up town ♪ No post code envy ♪ But every song's like gold teeth ♪ ♪ Grey Goose, trippin' in the bathroom ♪ ♪ Bloodstains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room ♪ ♪ We don't care, we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams ♪ ♪ But everybody's like Cristal, Maybach ♪ ♪ Diamonds on your timepiece ♪ Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash ♪ ♪ We don't care, we're not caught up in your love affair ♪ ♪ And we'll never be royals. ♪ Royals ♪ It don't run in our blood ♪ That kind of luck just ain't for us ♪ ♪ We crave a different kind of buzz ♪ ♪ And let me be your ruler. ♪ Ruler ♪ You can call me Queen B ♪ And baby I'll rule I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule ♪ ♪ Let me live that fantasy ♪ Yeah ♪ Hey ♪ Hey, yeah ♪ My friends and I we've cracked the code ♪ ♪ We count our dollars on the train to the party ♪ ♪ And everyone who knows us knows ♪ ♪ That we're fine with this ♪ ♪ We didn't come from money ♪ But every song's like gold teeth ♪ ♪ Grey Goose, trippin' in the bathroom ♪ ♪ Bloodstains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room ♪ ♪ We don't care, we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams ♪ ♪ But everybody's like Cristal, Maybach ♪ ♪ Diamonds on your timepiece ♪ Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash ♪ ♪ We don't care, we're not caught up in your love affair ♪ ♪ And we'll never be royals. ♪ Royals ♪ It don't run in our blood ♪ That kind of luck just ain't for us ♪ ♪ We crave a different kind of buzz ♪ ♪ So let me be your ruler. ♪ Ruler ♪ You can call me Queen B ♪ And baby I'll rule I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule ♪ ♪ Let me live that fantasy ♪ Oh, oh ♪ Hey, oh ♪ Oh, yeah, oh ♪ Yeah, ah ♪ Ohh, oh, yeah ♪ Oh, ohh - ♪ Oh. - ♪ Cadillacs in our dreams ♪ And we'll never be royals. ♪ Royals ♪ It don't run in our blood ♪ That kind of luck just ain't for us ♪ ♪ We crave a different kind of buzz ♪ ♪ So let me be your ruler. ♪ Ruler ♪ I can be your Queen B ♪ And baby I'll rule I'll rule, I'll rule, I'll rule ♪ ♪ So let me live that fantasy ♪ ♪ Ooh ♪
