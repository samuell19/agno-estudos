♪♪ ♪♪ Good morning. Good morning, Miep. Although, it's not so good, I admit. Still, it's not the end of the world. Ellie here thinks it's the end of the world. Well, I'm happy delay, that's progress perhaps, but not the end. Oh, Miep, isn't it terrible? Maybe it won't be so bad, Ellie. We'll just have to wait and see. The bright side, that's the ticket. If it won't be so bad, why did the queen run away to England? Wilhelmina did not run away. She'll do far better for us all in England as a... symbol of a free Netherlands than as a captive monarch in The Hague. Also it must have infuriated Hitler. That's an added dividend. And as for surrender, well... Nothing will be the same. Everything will be different now. They can't change everything, Ellie, not everything. It's just a matter of keeping up. That's the ticket. Well, so much for royal declarations of neutrality. It could've been worse, Kraler. Bear it in mind. We might have been bombed like Rotterdam. Think of the devastation of Rotterdam. Think of the dead. I was merely making an observation, Koophuis, not a judgment. Coffee, Ellie. Will it mean anything to the business, Miep, do you think? Oh, I don't think so, Ellie. Even the Germans like jam. Yes? Yes, sir. Good morning, Mr. Van Daan. Hello, Miep, how are you this morning? Yes, well, we all have to make the best of it, ay? As much as they'll permit us to, at least. Would you like some coffee? It's ready. Not just now. Thank you, Miep. Come. Good morning, Mr. Frank. Good morning. And as Mr. Cooper says, not so good. How are the others taking it, Miep? As well as can be expected, I suppose. When I left Germany in '33, the Nazi's were saying "Today, Germany, tomorrow, the world." Such a ridiculous boast it seemed to us then. Never the world, surely, Mr. Frank. Pray God. So... Meanwhile, Mrs. Frank and I are having a little gathering on Saturday. We would be very pleased if you and Jan would come by. Oh, that would be lovely, Mr. Frank, thank you. Life goes on. Travis and Company. It's me. How are you so far? I'm trying not to be too depressed, not very successfully I fear. Have you seen any of them yet? The master race? Not yet. I've been wondering all morning what I'll do the first time I see them. Oh, you'll look, and you look away and you'll go on. So will we all as best we can. What time will you be finished tonight? About 6:00, I should think. Shall we have dinner? Mr. Frank doesn't seem to think the business will be affected. Particularly, since we're a German firm. I suppose that may be so, but... We'll just have to wait and see. I just realized what's wrong. Is something wrong? Yes. Have you ever heard it so quiet here? That's what it is. Of course. I knew something was different. We can't let them make us start talking in whispers. It's only the first chalk. We'll go on. We'll go on! Yeah. I want more than ever now for us to find a place we can live together. If only we'd found something before the city began to burst with refugees. But don't worry, somewhere in Amsterdam at this very moment, a modest flat with an affordable rent is being vacated. That flat will be ours. I guarantee it. Do you have the address by any chance? I'm on optimist, not a magician. Hmm... That's good enough for me. Coming directly to the point, Miss, may I call you Hermina? Oh, if you like, I rarely use my formal name. Coming directly to the point, Hermina, I am, as I mentioned, a representative of The Amsterdam Chapter of the German Girls Association of the Netherlands. Our purpose, as you may have already presumed, is to add your name to our fast increasing roles of our membership here in Amsterdam. A brochure outlining our purposes and principals, which I believe you'll find quite inspiring. Of course, it is about Fuhrer Adolf Hitler. Our membership application, which is only a formality of course, but I believe you'll find it very useful. I suppose there's been some mistake. I'm not German, you see. Born in Vienna, Austria, 1909. Emigrated to the Netherlands 1920. Presently with Mr. and Mrs. Van Nuden, foster parents. Religious application, Catholic. Presently possessing a passport of the National Socialist Republic of Germany. That I hold a German passport was not by my choice, miss. My passport was Austrian until 1938 at the time of the German occupation of Austria when I was forced to accept a German passport. Nonetheless, I'm Austrian by birth, and Dutch by choice, by virtue of my great affection for this country and its people. In view of your disloyal attitude towards the fatherland, it seems curious that you've never become a naturalized citizen of this country from which you prefer such misguided affection. In recent years, I've had occasion to regret that carelessness, never more so than now. As for your Furher's principals, I think they may best be judged by the suffering they have caused for so many thousands of innocent people. The swastika is on my passport, miss, not on me. Bravo. Those are the types that need such telling off. To our Dutch friends. Our Dutch friends. Still, I think it might have been incautious of you, Miep. If Miep chooses not to join some silly little club of those hysterical female fascists, it's none of their business. Yeah. Perhaps. More coffee, Mr. Gies? Thank you. No, Mrs. Frank. I believe I've had my fill. You Germans like your coffee strong all right. Think this is strong? You should have tasted our coffee at home. This is only refugee coffee. Coffee that the spoon will stand up in, that's what's wanted. God, how I miss it. If only that was all that was to be missed of home, Herman. The trouble is, Edith, you still think of home as though it was still there. Germany is not there anymore, if you see what I mean. It was already not there when we had to run away from it. We're all homesick. I think perhaps Edith, just a little bit more. To be realistic, I must agree with Petronella, home is gone. No. It followed us the other day. Well, then, here's something we can all agree on, I think. To the Germany that was. Proest. Come, Pet, let's dance. Sweeping me off my feet. You're still light on your feet, Pet. Miep, I have some news for the two of you. In respect to your search for a flat. Which has grown rather desperate of late, in fact. There seems to be not so much as a cupboard to be found in all Amsterdam. I think I've managed more than a cupboard for you. We have a friend, Mrs. Sampson, quite near by in the Rainer Strasse. She lives alone, but in the recent situation, she has become quite fearful of being on her own. As it happens, she has two rooms rarely used. She has decided to make them available to let. I've spoken to her about you and the rooms are yours if you want them. If we want them? Oh, Mr. Frank, how can we thank you? This is wonderful news. Hello, Miep. Hello, Mr. Gies. Margot, where have been keeping yourself? In the kitchen. I thought you went to the cinema or something. And where is your sister? Sulking in the kitchen. Why is she sulking, darling? Because I beat her again of course, Father. At what? I've only played this once or twice before. I'm not very good. Have you seen the new American film, Miep? Not yet. What is it? "The Philadelphia Story," starring Katherine Hepburn and Cary Grant. I think Katherine Hepburn is fabulous. I think I like her even better than Carole Lombard, although it's a difficult choice. I think it would be wonderful to be either one of them, don't you? Cary Grant is a different story, of course. There's no question in my mind, when it comes to Cary Grant-- I think Cary Grant is the most terrifically handsome man in the entire world! Well, except for Daddy. Are you afraid of the Germans, Miep? I try not to be. But are you? So, we only have to go down there and give them this information they want to have. It's a kind of registration. For everyone? No, only the Jewish people. But why? It's the policy of the Germans in occupied countries. It's nothing to be worried about. A formality, that's all. But why would they want our names and where we live and what adults do in their professions? They are a very bureaucratic sort, the Germans. They like to have everything on record. They are very fond of paperwork, four copies of everything. It will be a wonder if they don't smother themselves to death in their own paperwork long before the Allies beat them. But mostly it has something to do with their not liking us, isn't that so, Daddy? ♪♪ All right. Go to the end of the line. Next. Next. How many? Now you sit down. Next one. Next. Next one. Next. Sit down. Sit straight. Look into the camera. Sit higher. Look here. Wait! Wait. Otto. Morning, Herman. How are you feeling? Not altogether up to snuff. I didn't want to stand another day. I know you can't get along without me. Carl called me at home yesterday. I didn't like at all what he had to tell me. Oh? What was that? That we have to register with the Germans as a Jewish firm. Gies and Company is as German as sauerkraut. All businesses run by Jews must register. All businesses with one or more Jewish partners must register. All businesses with a subsidiary firm or regional office, of which a Jew is a director, must register. I don't like this, Otto. They are going to close us down, do you think? I don't like to think too much about the future, Herman. Did you see? Look. Every radio in Amsterdam has to be registered with the police. What the hell is that all about? What's the matter, sweetheart? I've received a letter to appear at the German Consulate, Mrs. Sampson. What about? It doesn't say. It just says to appear before the 22nd of October. That's tomorrow. According to our information, you recently were afforded the opportunity of membership in the German Girls Association of the Netherlands. An opportunity that you chose to decline. Is this correct? They invalidated my passport. They say I have to leave Holland within 90 days. They say I have to go back to Austria. For how long? Permanently. They're deporting me permanently. What are you saying? Why? What's happened? Do you remember that stupid fascist club I refused to join? For that? For that. There's absolutely no possibility of a compromise of some sort? He called me an undesirable alien. A Nazi sitting at a Nazi desk in a country occupied by the Nazis, and he called me an undesirable alien. Compromise? What could I have said? That I would join his rotten little ladies club if he would let me stay in my own country? No, no, you could hardly have said that. Alien? I'm as Dutch as anybody born in any building on this street. In your heart.Where it matters. Not to them. I could kick myself around the block for never having become a legal citizen. What am I going to do? You're going to become a legal citizen. How? By marrying a Dutchman. If you marry a Dutchman, you'll be Dutch. They couldn't touch you. All you need to do is find a handsome, intelligent, charming gentlemen of Dutch birth, sound of mind and body and financially solvent, and with a fairly promising future in his chosen profession. Offering you comfort and security in your twilight years. May I suggest such a gentlemen? On all the occasions we discussed the possibility of marriage, I never imagined that the actual proposal would be quite like this. I might have done it in a more conventional way, but this was so much more interesting, don't you think? That's true. Do it in a conventional way. Will you marry me, my love? Yes. Jan, Miep! Come on! Please! Please. Yes, yes. Mrs. Frank, please! This way now! Smile, everyone. Thank you. Go on, you'll be late. You'll miss your train! It begins. It always begins, everywhere the Germans go. Do they know how many were taken? They estimate 400. They have been taken to some sort of detention camp. They won't be there for long, you'll see. They'll disappear. To where, not even the resistance will know. It always begins. Oh. Shhh. This is Radio Orange, the voice of the Dutch people from London. Good evening to our friends and loved ones in Holland. Most especially, we extend our respect and admiration to the people of Amsterdam who, in order to express their indignation and outrage of the Nazi offenses against the Jewish population of their city, recently concluded a three-day general strike against all major industry. The queen wishes to extend her deepest respect for the acts of morale and, yes, certainly physical courage in the face of the inevitable Nazi reprises for this brave act of defiance. Good luck and God be with you, people of Amsterdam. But you understand, the strikers knew what would happen and still it didn't stop them from doing what they wanted to do, to show us we have friends, to show us their hearts. Nor did it stop the Germans from showing us theirs today. What do you mean, Mama? The fact is... they issued some rather unfortunate rules today, girls. What kind of rules? Well, we won't be permitted to stay in hotels anymore, or patronize cafes or restaurants or cinemas. Libraries and public parks will also be out of bounds for us, I'm sorry to say. But never you mind. You'll be amazed how much you can learn to do without if you really have to. Meanwhile, there's one law they can't stop us from breaking. And I see it's time to break it. Germans are trying to jam it again. What would the Nazis really do if they caught us listening to radio or enjoying the BBC, Daddy? Ah, but they can't catch us, can they? How can they possibly know which Jewish people are listening to the radio and which aren't? There's nothing they can do about it. Come on. I don't know if the Americans being in the war will be of much help to us, Miep. Of course it will, Mrs. Samson, absolutely. They have to fight the Japanese. How much will will they be able to fight the Germans? They're only in North Africa, not even in Europe yet. America is a huge country with many men for fighting. We only have to be patient. Oh, marvelous. Absolutely. Will you dare to do that? If the Nazi's want to put yellow stars on the Jews, we'll show them plenty of yellow. You got to hand it to these Dutch, they've got guts. According to Radio Orange, the Dutch and the Danes are the only people in occupied Europe who have the nerve to stand up to Germans in ways like this. Did you hear that? It takes guts. They're going to speak to me today, Herman. Today? I think it's time, do you agree? Yes, yes, I agree. Miep, I have a secret to confide to you. You know, of course, that there are Jews here in Amsterdam, and elsewhere surely, who have gone into hiding? Yes. Mrs. Frank and I have decided to take that course of action. We are going to hide in with Margot and Anne. Mr. Van Daan and wife and son will join us. Yes, I see. As for the business, Mr. Koophuis and Mr. Kraler will be able to keep things going. And I will be available for consultation. Look, would you be willing... to help take care of us... while we're in hiding? Absolutely. Don't answer too quickly, Miep. You know the punishment for those who help the Jews is harsh. Imprisonment certainly sometimes. We needn't discuss that any further, Mr. Frank. Just tell me what you want me to do. Miep, I wondered if you would get you coat and come with me, would you? Now? Why not? A bit of a break from all this routine tragedy will do you good, come on. This is it. There you are, madam. Good day, Mr. Hendriks, see you next week. Ah, how are you, Van Daan? I could complain, but why bother? Give me half pound of this. Such as it is. Allow me to introduce my friend, Mrs. Gies. You're looking quite fit, Van Daan. It's all these miles of walking lately. You Protestants don't know what you're missing of the benefits. Not allowing the Jews in the streetcars anymore and taking away our bicycles is the best thing the Krauts have did for us by way of our health. Mustn't let them know, however, or they'll have us back on the streetcars in nothing flat. Well, back to the office for us. Mr. Van Daan, I don't understand why you wanted me-- Miep, look at it this way. In this life, it never hurts to know an honest butcher. Hello? What's the matter, dearest? What is it? Calm down. Calm down, Edith. Tell me what's happened. It was so good of you to come. We do not allow callers so late in the evening, but the fact is-- The fact is Margot... received a summons today to report for transit to a labor camp in Germany. Oh, my God. When? Tomorrow. Now, we--But she's only 16 years old. It doesn't matter to them, it doesn't matter. Is there anything that can be done, Mr. Frank? Yes. We aren't as prepared as we would like to be, of course, but this development makes it necessary for us to go into hiding immediately. Do you see? Tonight? Tomorrow morning. Are you still willing to help us, Miep? What do you want me to do? We still have one bicycle. I held it back when we were required to turn them in. Margot will use that if you will take her to the hiding place. It would be faster. It is an hour's walk from here to the office. She won't wear her star. We will follow along right after. You understand the situation, Miep? You will be with a Jew who is riding an illegal bicycle and is without her star. Go, go. Uhh! Is this it? The attic? Yes. You go on up. I'll be up again later. Stay away from the windows. Don't make any noise. Do you understand? The office will be opening soon. Father has explained everything. Couldn't I wait down there for them to come? No, it wouldn't be safe. They'll be along very soon. Gies and Company. May I help you? Yes. Oh, yes, it was sent this morning. Not at all. Good-bye. Thank you, Miep. Welcome. Have you had any luck in regard to the ration books? Jan has contacted his friends in the underground. They will provide us with forged ration books for all of you. No questions asked, of course. That's excellent. Now, what about my cigarettes? Have you had the chance to go by our flat, Miep? I passed by there yesterday, Mrs. Van Daan. I'm sorry to have to tell you it appears... they have emptied it out. Oh, well. Oh. All of our lovely furniture. All our pretty things. All gone. All gone! No, no, no, no. There, there, there. It's, it's all to the good. It's a good sign. It means they've given up on our returning. They know we've disappeared for certain. They'll forget all about us. You could have hardly expected to go back when this is all over and find things as they were, Petronella. You are not being realistic. Here is our shopping list, Miep. Just do what you can. Everything is in good order here, Koophuis. Thank you. Well, it's back to work for me. Mr. Frank, the shopping list, I think we'll be able to manage most of it, but I'm afraid our ration coupons simply won't provide us much meat. I believe Mr. Van Daan has seen to that. Ah. You may recall, Miep, our little walk we took together a couple months ago for a bit of shopping. May I presume that a certain butcher will be quite cooperative by way of ration coupons? It never hurts to know an honest butcher. May I help you, please? I'm not quite sure what I need. Why don't you wait on this gentlemen? Sir? See if you can find me six pork chops. If there was some meat on them, that would help. I can't believe it. I seem to have lost my list. I'll be back later. As you wish, ma'am. I found it. ...continued his pursuit in North Africa of Rommel's shattered army. British columns were said to be 200 miles west of El Alamein, close to the Libyan border. The United States Navy announced that army forces on Guadalcanal Island have attacked Japanese troops to the east of the airfield. It was also... Are you certain it was the man you knew? Don't I know Mr. Blumberg when I see him? He is walking the streets, before the war, and suddenly one day, he's gone. Certainly it was him. All this time hiding with Mr. and Mrs. Fontaine. They were betrayed, you know. They must have been betrayed. Yes, possibly, or they became careless. I don't think so. Not Mr. Fontaine, he's too clever. He's a very clever man. He's a professor at the university. No, they were betrayed. I just know it in my bones. For five guilders. That's what Germans are paying for Jews in hiding now, you know. Five guilders. Well... at least I'll know what I'm worth, Miep. What do you mean? I've made my decision, Miep. I'm going into hiding. You and Jan can stay on here, of course. In fact, I'll be thankful for it. If the flat was left unoccupied, you know what would happen. In no time, there would be a van out there being filled with all my possessions. Then I would come back to nothing. Assuming, of course, that I come back. Dinner offered by the Secret Annex on the occasion of the anniversary of the marriage of Mr. and Mrs. Gies, Esquire. To begin, bullion a la Miep, followed by roast beef Hendriks, medium rare. After which there will be salad riche onion, salad Hollandaise and one potato. And finally, sugar cinnamon. Cinnamon. And raspberry juice to be served with coffee, cream and various desert surprises. Voila! I want you to have this as a keepsake of this special occasion. We'll keep it always. I promise. Maybe on your next anniversary, you might consider inviting us to your home. Consider it done. We'll be there. Oh! I haven't seen a cake like that since we left home. The icing is a specialty of Margot's. What do you think of the situation in Stalingrad, Mr. Gies? It seems to me as though the Russians are making a terrific fight of it, Peter. You can bet the crowds in Stalingrad would rather be in North Africa fighting the Americans. At least it's war. How far is it from North Africa to Italy, Papa? Oh, not far, darling. A skip and a jump. The Allies will be invading Italy within six months, mark my words. Well, it still seems to me that the best news is what Miep has told us, and much closer to home, that the round-ups have stopped. It's been weeks and weeks since the last one. Maybe they are only making room in the death camps for more. Well, Miep, Jan, you might be interested to know that while we rely on you for events on the outside, Anne is keeping track of all the news in here. Such as it is. Writing it all down in your little book, aren't you, darling? Yes. It seems we have a writer in the family. Revealing all of our darkest secrets, no doubt. Scribble, scribble, scribble. Anne doesn't scribble. There are no dark secrets. And even if there was, I certainly wouldn't reveal them. It's a strictly private matter between me and myself. May I please be excused, Daddy? Anne can sometimes be awfully sensitive. That's more than could be said for some people. More coffee, Jan? May I come in? Yes, of course. I'm sorry I was so rude, but really, sometimes... Well, how can a person expect to remain calm and polite all the time in a situation that's so completely... not normal? Can you imagine having to sit in one place all day, every day without moving unless it's absolutely necessary from morning to night? I don't know what I would do if it wasn't for you and Jan and the others. There's just no telling how long it's going to last, is there? That's the worst part of it, I suppose. Not knowing when it will be over and when we can go back to our normal lives. I know it isn't the same as being locked away in hiding as you all are. But the way I try to think of the occupation is that every day that passes is one day less of it. Sometimes it helps to think of it that way. Yes. I see what you mean. I'll try to do that. In the meantime, do you know what I would adore to happen? What? I would adore it if you and Jan could come and spend the night here with us here one night. Oh. Well, I'm not quite sure that would be convenient for everyone. Oh, it would be no trouble at all. Look, you could stay here in our room, and Margot and I could sleep in Mommy and Daddy's room. It would be no trouble. I'll ask Daddy. If he says yes, will you? Will you stay the night with us, Miep? Well, if it's all right with the others, we'd be delighted. Oh, that would be wonderful. I know he'll say yes. I'll wait until tomorrow to ask him, though. He's probably not too pleased with me just now for being so rude to Mrs. Van Daan. Oh... I wonder, could you do something for me, Miep? Whatever I can. Could you bring me something more to write in? I'm running out of space in my diary. Daddy gave it to me on my last birthday just before... well, just before we came here. I'm sure I'll find you something. I kept a diary long ago when I was about your age. Do you have it still?No, I threw it away. Oh, you should have kept it, for always. Sometimes I wish I had. It might be amusing to know what kind of girl I was then. Exactly. I'm keeping mine for always. Okay, pull. Oh, God. Oh, my God. It could have been suicide, of course, but more likely the poor fellow simply died in hiding and had to be disposed of by his protectors. Rinse. I have decided I must go into hiding, Miep. Mrs. Dussel and I have discussed the possibility and decided it would be for the best that I find a safe address. Only you?My wife is a Lutheran. Oh, yes, of course, I had forgotten. She wants to go with me, but I have insisted. Why should she suffer for me in that way? You wouldn't happen to know of a safe address, would you, Miep, by any chance? I only ask because I know you and your husband have been good friends to us. For all I know, you may have helped the Franks and the Van Daans to escape. Oh, my God. How long has it been since they all disappeared? Six months? More? I only hope they are safe in Switzerland someplace. But I don't ask. It's none of my business. Well, if you hear of a place that might be possible for me. Open. I don't know, Jan. I'll have to think it over. Of course, there would have to be some discussion with the others. I understand. Have you looked for other possibilities? Yes, we have. To no avail so far. That's why we... decided to discuss the possibility with you. Of course you said nothing to Dussel about us here. Absolutely not. Well, I hope you enjoyed your stay at the hotel Secret Annex. If you are half as comfortable as Anne is delighted, you should have a decent night of it. After tonight, you will never want to stay in the hotels of Europe again. Good night. Good night.Sleep well. No, you took two when I put it down. It's my-- Everyone would have to agree to it, of course. But naturally, I wanted to discuss it with you first. If it comes to a vote, mine will be yes. How could we refuse, Otto? It would be a strain in every way. Because that than the thought of what might happen if we were to turn him away. As you say, how can we refuse? We'll talk to others in the morning. Who can tell? Another face might actually be something of a relief. God knows he's a far better bridge player than Petronella Van Daan. Are you asleep? Not yet. What are you thinking? That in the morning, we are free to leave here and live our normal lives. For the first time, I think I begin to know just the littlest bit what it's like to be them. I don't know how to thank you. Where is it to be? We can't tell you, Doctor, only--When? Tomorrow. Tomorrow? That's impossible. Delay is dangerous. If you begin to make preparations, you can't help it. Someone else notices, who knows who will become suspicious. It's too dangerous. Yes, all right, whatever you say. Will it be very far away in the country? Can you tell me that? No, Doctor, we can't tell you. I'm sorry. Tell me what you can. Tomorrow morning at 7:00, you go to this address. Wait there on the street. Carry as little as possible. Nothing that would make you conspicuous. The best way is to wear several layers of clothing. That's the usual thing, but don't overdo it. A man will approach you and say, "Follow me, please." That's all there is to it. And don't wear your star. But that is dangerous. What if... Yes. Yes, I see what you mean. Follow me, please. Quickly please, Doctor. Good God, what the hell is going on here? Pardon my French. Come and see, Doctor. This is amazing. I would never have dreamt it. Welcome to the Secret Annex, Dr. Dussel. Switzerland would have been better, Doctor, but we make the best of it. Come on, come on, everybody, breakfast is ready. If only I knew where he was, it would help a little, I think. Secrets fly, Mrs. Dussel. Things are best left as they are. The fewer who know will be safer. What happens if they die? Hmm? These people in hiding, what happens if they become ill and die? The Germans have increased the reward for the Jews. It must be because there are so few of them left. Have you noticed? One doesn't see many Jews about on the streets anymore. When it all began, I recall Albert telling me there were 140,000 Jews in Holland. I wonder how many are left. What's happened? Miep... Miep! I told you it was going to be all right, didn't I? I knew it! I told you! It was only natural to think it was the Germans down there. I said it might only be burglars. I was right. Always helpful to have an optimist around. What happened? Burglars. Well, Mr. Koophuis, that was a close one, I'd say. Obviously, we owe you a special thanks for the inspiration of that bookcase. Absolutely. Without that, those hoodlums would be through the door in nothing flat, turning us all in. What's the current German price on us? Still five guilders a piece? That's assuming, of course, they didn't hear us moving about up here. If they did, they might well be squawking to the green police this very minute. So far, so good. Koophuis, when this ridiculous nightmare is over, I'll buy you the biggest bottle of champagne to be found in all of Amsterdam. There's nothing original about it at all. It always happens in those, uh, those spooky films. The hidden door behind the bookcase. What was the name of that fellow always in those films, Anne? Bela Lugosi. That's the fella. The one with the cape. Always the hidden door behind the bookcase. It was obvious. In that case, we should all write a letter of thanks to Mr. Lugosi. I'll sharpen his teeth at no charge. for the rest of his life. What's the matter with you? Are you totally crazy? Can't you obey the most simplest of rules? Damn you all! You vile, rotten people! You think you own the world and everyone in it! You don't own the world! You'll never own it! Never! And every day you're losing more of what you did! And thank God for that! Our day will come! And when it does, we'll make you pay for everything! For everything you've done! Something terrible has happened. Hendriks has been arrested. Hello, Mr. Dortmunn. Hello, Mrs. Gies. An arrest you say? Not a friend of yours, I hope. Well, no, he isn't a friend exactly. He was our... He was my butcher. Butcher? Safe to guess what brought about that arrest, then. The black market, no doubt. A Jew? No, no, he isn't a Jew. There are some Christians who are not altogether kosher either, eh, Kraler? Better luck next time in your choice of butcher. Heil Hitler. Have a safe journey, Mr. Dortmunn. Thank you. He just dropped in out of nowhere. On his way back to Germany, visiting the branch offices and complaining about the quality of the product. It was all I could do to refrain from reminding him that if they hadn't started the war, the quality of the product would be as good as it ever was. I have to go sit down. My knees are shaking. Anne, I brought you some more notebooks. Oh, thank you, Miep, that's wonderful. Miep? Hmm? What's your opinion on the Americans invading Italy? Why didn't they invade France as they've been promising is what I'd like to know. Italy is so far away. It will take them an awfully long time to get here from Italy, don't you think? I have also brought you a little gift. I don't know if they will fit, you're growing so fast. Have you noticed? I think Peter has. Uh, shoes. Only second-hand, but I think pretty good. Oh, Miep! For me? Oh, they're beautiful! I've never had high-heeled shoes. Well, it's time you had. Try them on. See if they fit. Oh! I feel like I'm going to fall on my face. We all do at first. You'll get used to it. Walk. Oh! Only one bag per person. It's hardly worth the waiting. ♪♪ Hello. Good morning, Mr. Koophuis. What news? Oh, my God. Is that true? Are you certain? Oh, my God. Yes, yes. Thank you, Mr. Koophuis, thank you. Jan! Jan! They've come! ...troops of United States, Great Britain and Canada. General Eisenhower's communicade was calculated to give little information to the enemy. We repeat again the full text of his message broadcast earlier this morning, the 6th of June, 1944. People of Western Europe, a landing was made this morning on the coast of France by troops of the Allied Expeditionary Force. This landing is part of a concerted united nations plan for the liberation of Europe made in conjunction with our great Russian allies. I have this message for all of you. Although the initial assault may not have been made in your own country, the hour of your liberation is approaching. All victims, men and women, young and old, have a part to play in the achievement of final victory. To members of resistance movements... Steady. Don't move. They say they can't find the work order anywhere. Shall we discuss your friends upstairs? We must keep calm. They may only be sniffing around. I think they know. I think they know. Miep, the ration books. Oh, my God. Jan, they're all here. Are they found?Not yet. I think they know, Jan. Don't let the police find it. Take the ration books out of here. Elli, go with Jan. Yes, Elli, go with Jan. Get a raincoat. You. Back already? You're working too hard, Jan. You should at least take your full lunch time. It doesn't take very long to eat what little there is these days, does it. No. You can say that again. Papers. Born in Vienna. I was born in Vienna, too. You shame your German blood. As you can see, I am married to a Dutchman. I am Dutch. You are a German slut helping to hide Jewish garbage. You betray the Fatherland, you shame your people and you shame me! I expect no more from this Dutch trash! But you? How dare you display such contempt for one of the Furher's greatest personal victories by harboring these specimens of Jew filth! I can't believe you are so stupid as not to have understood the consequences of your disgusting actions. Are you prepared for them now? Are you prepared to share the fate of your Jew friends?! Or the punishment of these Dutch Jew lovers? You are a stupid, stupid, woman. So... what am I going to do with you? Hmm? What am I going to do with you? I tell you frankly that only our common blood gives me the slightest hesitation in that regard. You have that to thank and nothing else for whatever shred of sympathy I might feel for you at this moment. That and nothing else, you understand. Do you understand? I can only say that I am prepared for whatever consequences there may be. Ah! Everybody out! Move! Move! Maybe we can buy them back. What? If we could get enough money together... we could take up a collection. There are plenty who would contribute. Maybe we could buy them back. Darling--There have been rumors. You know as well as I do that the Germans can sometimes be approached now that they are losing the war. You know as well as I, after all these years, the reliability of rumors. But maybe we could. Maybe we could buy them back. In respect to what? To our friends. How much money would it take to free them? You think we're in the business of selling Jews? I thought that it might be possible to appeal to you-- If we were in the business of selling Jews, we'd all be millionaires now. In 30 seconds, you will either be out on the street on your way home, or you will be in transit to the Amersfoort camp to join your Dutch friends. One or the other. I can promise you. I, uh, shall be brief. The Germans have capitulated unconditionally. The war is over. Hello, Miep. Of course, when we arrived at Auschwitz, they separated the men from the women. This was standard procedure. But there was sometimes ways of keeping track of others in the camp, the usual grapevine sort of thing. After some months, October, I think. Anne and Margot... and Mrs. Van Daan were transferred to Bergen-Belson. Edith... I'm sorry to have to tell you, Edith won't be coming back. She died in Auschwitz infirmary sometime during the winter. Van Daan, I saw with my own eyes on his way to the gas chamber. Oh, God. Just before the Russians liberated the camp, the Germans took a great many of the younger, stronger men with them in their retreat. Peter was one of those. I don't know what happened to him. Nor Dr. Dussel. I lost track of him altogether, I'm sorry to say. And Mrs. Van Daan and the girls? I have high hopes. Bergen-Belson wasn't a death camp, you see. There were no gas chambers. And I think especially Anne and Margot, they are young, stronger. Anne will be 16 in just a weeks time, you know? The 12th of June. Yes... I have high hopes. This is terribly kind of you, Miep. I can't thank you enough. You are welcome to say here for as long as you like, Mr. Frank. It would please us so very much if you would consider this your home until you can make more comfortable arrangements for yourself. Well, then, it would please me very much if you would call me Otto. Oh, uh, it's never seemed... Well, of course, if you prefer it. Of course, Mister--- Uh, but only outside of the office. I think it would be very awkward for me to be so informal at the office. If you insist. Especially if there would be no office for me to come back to if it were not for you. Fortunately, after Mr. Koophuis was released, we're able to keep on keeping on. Such good news about him and Kraler. I thought of them often and prayed God they wouldn't be severely punished. Yes. May I? Thank you. Yes, fortunately, all our prayers were answered, in that respect, at least. Now, what about these people you have spoken to who are trying to relocate prisoners from the camps? When might you have some news of Anne and Margot? It's impossible to say. There are so many, Miep. "Displaced persons" they call us. There are millions. Isn't it astonishing? Millions. Just last week, after Mr. Kraler came back, we talked about that day for the first time altogether. Mr. Kraler and Mr. Koophuis and Elli and Jan and I about who might have done it. Who might have been the one who betrayed you. But, of course, we could only suspect and speculate. I wonder if we'll ever know. Do you want to, Miep? Don't you? No. I don't ever want to know. Come. Good morning, Mr. Frank. Good morning. Your mail. Thank you. Have you heard the news this morning, sir, about this bomb? Yes, I have. It seems inconceivable. Maybe it will end the war over there. Pray God. Mr. Frank? Mr. Frank? Otto? Otto, are you all right? Anne and Margot are... ...not coming back, Miep. Excuse me, Otto. I was saving this for Anne. We were only a few of the very, very many good Dutch people who did what we did or more, much more, during those dark and terrible times. Many years ago, in time, always, like yesterday, in the forever changed hearts of those of us who bore witness. ♪♪
