(MultiCom Jingle) - A, Maria, the guards. - B, April, Kako to the roof. - C, Terry, Michelle, Elaine, through the gate. - D, explosive to the roof. - E, down the chimney. - F, April, Kako to the van. - G, pick up Maria. - [All Women] H, drive the hell outta there, woo! - [April] Oh no, it's not gonna work. - Why? - Well first of all, take off the brass knuckles. You don't look like you've been hurt. Here, try this. - Lipstick? Oh well, okay. - No, not on your lips, here, like a bruise. - Oh no, my face! - Oh, that looks fine. The compound's just like you said. Good job, April. - Not quite. Look. (dramatic music) - More guards on horseback. Damn! - That's not all, girls. On the tower. - Well, I only saw two guards before. - Maybe they added some after we hit them at the beach. - Doesn't matter, the question is, what are we gonna do about it? - Improvise. Look, we've got surprise on our side. We can still do it, we can still blow up that compound. - Maybe, but it's not gonna be as easy as A, B, C. - We voted before, we'll vote now. Thumbs up, we attack. Down, we get outta here. - I'll take care of the guards in the tower. - No way, you're needed on the roof. I'm the only one who can be spared. If I don't make it back, the rest of you can still blow up this compound. (suspenseful string music) (grunting) - Oh no, I shouldn't have-- - Yes, you should have. We've got a job to do. Are we gonna do it, or not? - Yes. - Yes. - Yes. - Yes. (sighing) - Yes. - Don't worry, I'll get those guys at the gate. - Be careful. Come on, let's go. - [Elaine] You got the wire cutters? Good. (suspenseful string and horn music) (men chattering) (horse hooves clopping) - Come on. (branch snapping) - As easy as A, B, C. (laughing) We're up, let's go. (suspenseful music) - [Man In Cowboy Hat] Be right back. - [Man In Tan] Boy I'll tell ya, we never get anything that-- (grunting) (thudding) - Hey, wait a second. (whacking) - Come on. - [April] Okay. - Hey. - Wait, don't shoot. Please, don't shoot. - [Guard] It's a broad. - Looks like a ghost. - She's all right. (laughing) - I was walking out in the mountains and, well I fell and I scratched my cheek and I broke my shoe. Is there anything you can do to help me? I mean, is there anything at all you can do? (dramatic music) (vehicle squealing) - [Elaine] The turret gun is ready. - All right, all right, here we go. - [Elaine] Hang on girls. - [Guard] Hey, what's that sound? Heh, look at that. - [Guard] What is it? - [Guard] I don't know, should we fire? (grunting) (whacking) (spraying) (thudding) (crashing) (guns firing) - Take that, you turkeys. - Shoot, I'm getting (speech muffled by gunfire) (groaning) (bullets ricocheting) - Oh, (speech muffled by gunfire) Ahh! (squealing) I'm gettin' outta here. - Here come the guards! (horses neighing) (exploding) (laughing) (exploding) (grunting) - Yeah! - [Michelle] Stop at the roof, Elaine. April, here, the explosive. - [Terry] Ready, Elaine. - [Elaine] Okay, go. Ram 'em all. (engine revving) (men shouting inside compound) (exploding) (dramatic music) (gunfire) (screaming) (crashing) (exploding) - Ready, catch! - Got it. - Let's go, hurry girls, come on! April, come on, get in here! - [Kako] Come on, come on! - Put the gun in, put the gun in. - Come on! - Ooh, ooh, I'm coming, I'm coming. - Come on! - Oh, okay. I'll bet you're wondering what a nice girl like me is doing on the roof of this building. Well, to tell you the truth, I'm wondering that myself about now. It all started a few months ago with a street pusher named Sticks. He was pushing drugs to kids. I'm a school teacher. Some of them were my students. (dramatic horns, strings, and drums music) (tires squealing) - Pft, not interested. Look, I'm not interested Why don't you go get some money from your rich sister or somethin', huh? I'm not a pawn shop. Look, go get the green stuff, then we'll deal. (thumping) You little twerp! Why'd you hit me? You got beer on my, that's not beer. That's blood! - You sure you know who hit you? - Yeah. Look, he snuck up behind me and really clobbered me one. Don't worry, I know who the kid is. He's been usin' for months. He didn't get away with much, though, just a few. - Well I can't let some little punk get away with this. News has a way of gettin' around fast. Awful bad for business. Get in. Man, you are dumb, you know that? You are really dumb, lettin' some punk kid roll you like that. - I'm really sorry, Mr. Farrell. It'll never happen again, I swear. - Yeah, yeah. But uh, sorry don't get the job done, so. (suspenseful music) - [Sticks] There he is, Mr. Farrell. I told ya I knew where he'd be. (gasping) (car clanking) (heavy breathing) - [Boy] No, no. (laughing) (grunting) - Hey, hey, hey dummy, don't hurt him too bad. Leave a roll on him so they'll know he's a user. Let's get the hell out of here, come on. (energetic music) (ball rattling) ♫ The truth of time ♫ Tells no lies ♫ The look of love is still in your eyes ♫ You kept your word until the end ♫ If I could choose, I'd be with you again ♫ Our love has stood the test of time ♫ Always and forever, you can have this heart of mine ♫ Ooh, you make me wanna shine, shine, shine, shine ♫ Shine your love, shine your love on me ♫ Baby just shine, shine, shine, shine ♫ Shine your love, shine your love on me ♫ Why don't you shine, shine, shine, shine ♫ Shine, shine, shine, shine ♫ Shine it all on me ♫ Shine on me ♫ Sha shine, shine your love ♫ Sha shine, shine your love ♫ Sha shine, shine your love ♫ Sha shine, shine your love ♫ Sha shine, shine your love ♫ Sha shine, shine your love ♫ Sha shine, shine your love ♫ Sha shine, shine your love ♫ Sha shine, shine your love ♫ Baby, shine your love, shine your love on me ♫ Sha shine, shine your love ♫ Sha shine, shine your love ♫ Shine, shine, shine, shine ♫ Shine your love, shine your love on me ♫ Just shine, shine, shine, shine ♫ Shine your love, shine your love on me ♫ Why don't you shine, shine, shine, shine ♫ Shine, shine, shine, shine ♫ Shine your love on me ♫ Baby just shine, shine, shine, shine ♫ Shine, shine, shine, shine ♫ Shine your love on me ♫ Baby just shine (audience applause) (cheering) (whistling) - Thank you, thank you very much. As most of you know, this is my closing show of this engagement, and there's somebody in the audience I'm sure you'd all like to meet, one of the living legends of show business, Mr. Arthur Godfrey. (audience applause) You've been a wonderful audience, and as always, Las Vegas is the best place in the world to entertain. Thank you. (cheering) (lively guitar and drums music) - Baby, you were great! You've knocked 'em dead, tremendous! The hotel couldn't be happier. (laughing) - Thanks, Manny, it felt great. (knocking) - [Manny] Come in. - Mr. Godfrey, I'm so glad you came by. - Please call me Arthur. I just had to say thank you for that wonderful introduction. That was very kind of you. And I had to come back and tell you, you were great, wonderful. Michelle, you're just starting. You can have anything you want, TV, movies, anything. You have the makings of a superstar. Now, I've invited all the stars that are playing Vegas this week to come to my suite about three o'clock in the morning for a little get together. I'd love to have you come. Can you make it? - Oh, I'd love to, but I'm due in LA tomorrow. - Oh, well, I'd love to have you, but I understand your career comes first, of course. You keep straight like that, and you will be a star. - Thank you, Mr. God, Arthur. - (laughing) Bless you. And if I can ever be of any help to you, please call. - Thank you. - Goodbye Arthur, and thanks a lot for stopping by. Sweetheart, I've got us booked again for the Carson Show. Everything's gonna start happening for us. All that work that you've worked so hard for, it's gonna all start paying off. Nothing can stop us, and with your record on the charts and still climbing, we're hot, I mean, like sizzle! - Yes, but right now all I wanna do is change and get on that plane for home. (phone ringing) - Hello? Look, don't bother her with phone calls now. Oh? You'd better take this one. - Hello, this is Michelle Wilson. Oh my god, not Bobby. Is he all right? Oh no. (water trickling) - Everything'll be all right. We're lucky. I'll pay all expenses, everything. So just take a couple of weeks off, relax, that way you can go see Bobby in the hospital and, well, then you'll see, he'll be home in no time. - 'Scuse me Ms. Wilson, a Ms. Thomas is here to see you. She say to tell you she's Bobby's schoolteacher. - Show her in, please. - Pleased. Michelle, I'll leave you two alone. Now if you need anything, call, day or night, anything. Pardon me. - I'm awfully sorry about Bobby. He's a fine boy. Nobody deserves a beating like that. - He wouldn't even tell me who beat him up. The doctors said he was on drugs. My god, I didn't even know he was using this stuff. He's so young. - Bobby's lucky, he'll be okay. Some kids aren't as lucky. - I shouldn't have left him with just a housekeeper. - I'm talking about the men who push poison onto young kids. Something's gotta be done to stop it. Every day a new drug comes along, and these creeps push it on to kids. I've got something in here for you to see. This is very interesting, and I've got it in a very important place. It's in here, I know it is, someplace. It's really important. I know I've got it in here, now just a moment. Oh, heck. Oh wait, wait. Ah, here it is. I'm taking a big chance showing you this. I've been working on this for over two years. This is an area located about 75 miles east of Los Angeles. Nearest town's over 20 miles away. This is where they take the stuff that comes in from overseas, and process it down to what they sell on the street. There is millions of dollars worth of drugs being processed in this building, much of it highly explosive chemicals. We can destroy it in less than a minute, and I know the people who can help us, but I can't approach them. They don't know me, would never trust me. But since your song's doing so well and they know who you are, maybe we could approach them together. - You really think that we could pull this off? - Oh yes, I'm positive. I'm a very organized person, and this map is perfect in every detail. I know we can do it. Women can make a difference. (engine humming) (guns firing) - Fantastic! Cut. (clapping) You all right? - Sure, no sweat, it was a snap. Did you get it, I hope? - [Director] Yeah, I think so. How'd it look? - [Bystander] Terrific. - Yeah, okay. That's good, you can go now. Let's get a real actor in here please. Come on, Rick, hurry up with the actor, would ya? Come on, could we get an actor? Geez. - Her name's Terry Grant. She's the best stunt driver in Hollywood. She can drive and modify a vehicle better than anyone else in this town. She'll help us. Her brother overdosed five years ago. Oh um, Ms. Grant? That was a fantastic stunt. Are you okay? - Oh sure, thanks. There's nothin' to it, if you know what you're doin'. Hey, you're Michelle Wilson, aren't you? God, I just love your voice. Are you working on this movie? - No, but we've got somethin' to talk to you about, and it's not making movies. - So come on in, we'll talk. - Yah! - [April] That's Kako Umaro, here from Vietnam a little over two years, and knows what problems the kids can get into. She teaches karate and dance for these kids in the morning. She'll help. - Yah, yah, yah! Yah, yah, yah! Yah, yah, yah! (cymbals chiming) - [Kids] Yay! - Darn it, now I know it's in here somewhere. I just know it, I put it here myself. Oh, oh good, here it is. Here it is, oh good, okay. Are you ready? Do you think you could climb to the roof of that building and drop explosives down the chimney? - Are you kidding? If it keep one kid from gettin' hooked, I'll climb up to the top of the city hall and dump that bomb down. - Hey you know, that really sounds great but uh, we're talkin' about a well armed place here. Can you do this job or not? - Well, how many guards are there? - Just two, see? Just two at the gate. - I don't know. There must be more guards inside those buildings. - It would sure help to keep those guards' attention away from the roof of that building. - I've got an idea. Just might do the job. (camera clicking) Her name's Maria. She could keep the guards' attention away from the roof of the building. She'll help us. She's an ex-junkie. She's been outta prison a little over six months. You've all probably seen her pictures in the magazine. She's a top model. - You're so beautiful. Now, just just just, just, lift your dress, just a little bit. Great, great, let me see. Shake your head out, shake your head. - Hi, Teach. - Oh, hello Trish, how are ya today? - No school, I'm cool. Hey Teach, is that Michelle Wilson? - Uh, yes it is. Excuse us. (upbeat chiming music) (nails clacking) (pounding) I wonder where Maria is. Terry, are you sure we can trust her? - I'm positive. Look, you girls gotta learn how-- - Hi everybody. - See? - This is Elaine Braddock, she's a friend of mine. She helped me when I needed her, and boy, we could sure use her help now. - Maria told me about your plan. I think it might be successful. At least, it's worth an attempt. - I don't think we really need your help. - [April] Let's listen to her, Terry. - Maria told me about this. You're April, right? What's your plan? - We're gonna drop a bomb down the chimney of that building. - That's a nice idea, but it's not a plan. Where's this compound located? - When the time comes, I'll show you all where it is. - If that's the way you want it, that's all right. Now let's assume that these are the three buildings. This is our target, and this is the main gate, okay? Maria gets the guards' attention here. April and Kako cut through the wire and get to the roof of this building. Michelle, Terry, and myself bust through the main gate. We'll need a heavy duty van or truck to hit that gate. - That's no problem. I'll buy us anything we need. - And I can fix up a van so it'll blast through any gate, and nobody will be able to stop us. - All right! I think it's great! - Trish, what are you doing here? - Well, I heard you ask Maria for help, and-- - This is no place for a kid. - I can help! Besides, well I, I know what you guys are planning to do, and-- - Are you trying to blackmail us? - No, but I can help around here. Look, look, I'll put things away, or I can help with the nails. See, see (speech drowned out by dramatic music) - April? - Yeah? - Hey, what do you think? - I don't know. What do you think, Terry? - Hey, don't worry, when I get through with this thing, it'll be fantastic. - Well howdy girls. Shall I gasoline her up for you? Well, mercy, mercy says Mrs. Percy. You girls are as pretty as a creek full of catfish. (laughing) You need this van. I can make you a deal as sure as a goose goes barefooted. Now, all you gotta do is just put a little down payment in the paltry sum of 12,673 dollars and 88 cents, it's all yours, just as it stands. - Well, maybe we could make a deal about the 73 dollars. - Say, you're the pick of the litter, you know that? - Well thank you! - Then how about that 88 cents? - [Kako] Hey yah! - Hey, hold it there. - Hey yah! - Oh, oh you girls sure do cover a vehicle. You jump around, it's like a rooster going through a hen house. - Nevermind about the trading stance, Tex. Just mail the title to the address on the check. - All right, it's ours! - Let's go, girls. - It's, it's, uh the check, wait. Hold it there, the check. Wait girls. Hey, it has to be verified. Oh well, they'll recall the van back to the factory in a few weeks anyway. (torch hissing) ♫ Late at night, it's cold and wet ♫ That's when you came to me ♫ I was down and out and I had no hope ♫ Could you please help me ♫ You fill me with your spirit ♫ Now your words have set me free ♫ Only took a moment ♫ So it seemed to me ♫ I can tell by your touch ♫ Heaven sent you here to me ♫ You told me that you had to go ♫ But you return it bodily ♫ I'm in heaven ♫ Seventh heaven ♫ I'll be in heaven ♫ Seventh heaven ♫ I'm in heaven ♫ Seventh heaven ♫ Heaven, seventh heaven ♫ In my heart I know that you're not make believe ♫ Wishin' and hopin' not only from a dream ♫ Seventh heaven - Not as well as we'd hoped. Pure indifference, nobody's come for it. I'll do my best. Thank you very much, you're most kind. Yes sir. (phone clanking) Sit down, Braddock. - Yes sir. - You requested to see me? I sure as the devil don't wanna see you. - I've made contact with an underground group. - Well go on, didn't they teach you how to give a report? With all the special training we gave you, you'd think-- - I only have the training that everybody else has, and if you think that-- - Let's not discuss the lowering of standards allowing women on the force. Now get on with your report. - Well as I was saying, I've made contact with an underground group, of women. - Dealing drugs? - No, sir. - Is there something about your orders you don't understand? Or do you just enjoy making my life miserable? You know our job is specific, special task force, special funding, special personnel to deal with the drug problem, nothing else. - These girls aren't dealing. But they are involved with the drug problem, sort of. - Just how sort of? - Well they've got detailed plans, a map indicating a processing compound, PCP and who knows what else. They're gonna blow it up. - Tell me I didn't hear you right. - They're gonna hit it, you know, blow it up. - Where's this compound located? Our people will take care of it, you stay out of it. - That's just it. I don't know where the location is. - Well, find out and report back to me. We can't have a bunch of broads running around. - It's my understanding that we do have special authority, and if-- - Listen, and get this straight, Braddock, I have the special authority. You do what you're told, and what I'm telling ya is to keep a lid on this situation. Find out where that processing compound is located, and report to me, understand? (low, dramatic music) - [Elaine] Each of us should know how everything works. - First I have a question, Terry. - Yeah? - Is it pretty enough for Maria? - [Maria] Oh yes, it's just beautiful. I just love it. - Well you'll love it even more when you see what this baby can do. - Watch this. (beeping) (van humming) And this. (all speaking simultaneously) - What is that? Wow. - Look at that bike! Wow, this is neat. - [Elaine] Trish? - [Trish] Yeah? - [Elaine] Wanna be on TV? - Yeah. - [Elaine] Stand up behind the van with Terry, and smile. Come here, girls. - [April] What's that? (beeping) (laughing) This is terrific, you guys. - [Michelle] What's the cross for? - A little surprise for anybody following. You see that bazooka? - I like this. This is really nice. - Just push that button, and whoever is following us, boom! Ain't no more. - This is really neat! I mean, really. Oh oh, you forgot the battery lamp. We've gotta bust through the main gate at the compound. - All built in, 3/4 inch of steel. She'll take any gate and a lot more. - We've gotta do one more thing before we destroy that processing compound. - Oh no, what'd I forget? - We've gotta lay our hands on some heavy ammunition to arm this baby. There's a bunch of right wing military fanatics that headquarter out in Ventura county. They've got an organization called the American Rights. They've got an arsenal there. They're prepared to start World War three. - If we're gonna steal their guns, we better check it out first. Like I always tell my students, preparation is the key to an A plus. - I'll go down and snoop around as a potential member. - That's no good, Elaine. They might recognize a cop. - Well, how about me? I could tell them I wish to make a big donation for my poor deceased husband's estate. I shake my butt a little, then we'll get all the ammunition we need. - Okay, and to make this work, I'll go as your chauffeur, just in case there's any trouble. - Trouble? Do you think there might be some trouble? - Oh no, you can handle it. Just put the mason brass knuckles in your purse. - Well, I never go anywhere without them. - And we'll be close by, just in case. - And I can climb through a window or something. - And you can stand by the phone in the garage in case of any emergency. (laughing) - Aw, I never get to do any of the fun. (suspenseful string and drumming music) - Mrs. Hidalgo Campbell of Houston. - You were expected, Mrs. Campbell. Step right this way. - Thank you. - Hired help must wait outside. - If you don't mind, I'll go with Mrs. Campbell. You better step aside. I've given fair warning. - Now, now dear, you'll do as you're told. No more, no less. - Ah, yes, yes, yes, welcome, welcome Ms. Campbell. (laughs) Delighted to make your acquaintance. I am commander Lindsay March, commander of the American Rights. - Yes, the pleasure will be all mine, I'm sure. - Oh you lovely ladies and your lovely rings. - Oh, there seems to be some problem about my chauffeur. - Well, we have very tight security here, if you know what, me must all follow the same rules, do you understand? - Well, yes I do, and I am quite pleased. Perhaps I should inspect your security. I mean, before I am to make any big donation. My late husband always taught me to be very cautious. - Oh, very wise, very wise of your late husband. How did he come to a sorry end? - Oh, in the saddle I'm afraid. - (laughing) What a way to go. In the saddle, then? - Yes, he was um, thrown from his favorite horse. - Oh, how tragic. Would you care to um, um... - With my chauffeur? - With your chauffeur. Well now, perhaps we'd better make it a tour of the grounds first. I'll just show her a little tour, if you please, sergeant. Clean up this mess, immediately! - Yes sir, right away sir. - [Lindsay] Insubordination. - Hold this. - I wanna take you on a tour of the facilities since you're here. That's going to be the parade grounds, and the barracks are way past there, and then we have livestock. I intend this entire establishment to be self-sustaining. Now of course, this is what you'd call the grate, for those who don't shape up. We expect a high moral type of person, and we expect our... (dramatic horn music) And uh, Mrs. Campbell, you'll find that your very generous contributions will be put to very good use. Everything, of course, is legal and all our properties are sacrosanct under the law. - Excellent, and you have no fear of criminal elements attempting to steal your supplies? - Oh, none whatsoever. My men are more than able to the task, as you can see. (grunting) - Don't let that fall, don't let that fall. (muffled speech) - Where do you want me to put this, commander sir? - Just put it down, will you sergeant? (crashing) Perhaps you'd come in here and I could offer you a drink. - Oh, no thank you Commander March, but I am running a little late. We'll have to conclude our business another time. Come on, Terry. - I hope that the problem with your servant hasn't-- - Tell you what, let's you and me shake and make up. - Only out of respect for your beautiful and generous employer. (cracking) (groaning) - Terry, uh, why don't you stop? We'll come back later. You have my promise. (laughing) - Help me up, will you? Respect the uniform. What is that? (whirring) (clanking) (mumbling) (suspenseful string music) - Careful. Hurry. - Darn, they never let me do anything. ♫ Over hill, over dale ♫ And the Caissons go rolling ♫ God bless America ♫ Noble and free - Oh good, you've got the gun. Oh, be careful. Hurry! Be careful, be careful. Are they heavy? Watch the wire. Be careful. Oh my gosh, you've got a machine gun, oh! We've been spotted, hurry! (alarm blaring) - What is it? - The ammunition, come on! (dramatic music) - [April] Hurry. (rattling) - It's locked, it's locked. - Hurry. - [Guard] It's locked! It's locked, it's locked. - [Lindsay] Hey! Hey, don't worry, I'll be there. I'm on my way. - [Guard] It's locked, it's locked, it's locked. It's locked! - Run fast, get them, all speed. Full speed ahead, I'll be there with you, your fearless leader. - [April] Come on. - I'm coming, you hear me. I'm prepared men, never fear, the commander is here. Who's got the key? - You've got the key! - I've got the keys? Here, uh, hold this, I've got the keys. There we are, I think that's it. Oh, ho ho, oh yes, I'm sorry, I'm sorry about that. (huffing and puffing) Unlock the gate. - [Guard] It's locked! - [Lindsay] Here Ricky, there's the key right there. - [Guard] It's locked! - [Lindsay] Well unlock it then! - It's locked, it's locked, it's locked. (speech drowned out by dramatic music) It's unlocked, it's open! - After them men, go! Guards, to the (mumbling), after them! After them, get the guns and the ammunition. Don't let up. (groaning) (plopping) (all men yelling simultaneously) - Hold it, gentlemen. Get over there. - [Terry] Wait a minute, this turkey's all mine. (grunting) (crashing) (laughing) (guns firing) (glass shattering) - Fantastic, the marines have landed. - And it didn't take us any four months of police officer training, either. - Yeah, but it didn't take you three months of learning how to march in a straight line. (laughing) - Elaine, can I please? Please, let me try, come on. - Well? - Come on. - Yeah, give her a chance. - [Kako] Let her try. - Please? Oh boy. Oh good. Can I fire now? - Ready, aim, fire! (gun firing) - Why does it jump-- - Be careful! (bullet ricocheting) - I'd better go after her, poor kid. - No Michelle, I'll do it. I'll bring her back here and really teach her how to fire this thing, even if it kills me. - Well, I think we're ready to hit the processing compound. - Van's ready, so am I. - Uh, I'm afraid we may be a little late. There's word going around school that the shipment's about to hit the street any day. - If the shipment left the compound, we should hit it before it gets on the street. - If we don't stop that shipment, that poison will be hooking kids. - Let's stop it then. - All right, I agree, but how? We don't even know where the shipment's coming in. - I know a guy that can tell us. (suspenseful music) - [Sticks] Hey. - Hey Sticks baby. - Where you been, where'd you get this machine? - You like it? Nice, huh? Tell ya what, you oughta come inside and have a look. - Yeah? - Yeah. - What you got in there? - Well why don't you come in and see. - Hi Stick. - Hey, what ya got in there? (thudding) - Before we start between his legs, let's ask him one more time. - [Terry] Tell us the exact location of the next pickup, pusher man. - What pickup? I don't know anything about a pickup. - Scum like you have been poisoning kids. - Come on, I haven't poisoned anyone. Just let me down, come on girls. - Maybe you don't think we're serious. Right here, Kako. - No, no, come on. (screaming) - This is the guy that hooked me, so don't be too cafeful. - No, come on, come on baby, you know I always liked you. (whacking) (groaning) Come on. No, no, okay. Okay, I'll tell you, just let me down, all right? Just let me down. - All right, pusher man. When, where, and how? - Come on, I can't even think straight. Just let me down on my feet and I'll tell ya. Come on. - He needs a little more persuasion. - No, no, come on, come on, you wouldn't. No, no, all right, all right! (screaming) (suspenseful music) - Maybe Sticks lied to us. I don't see anything out there. - Who could see anything in this fog? Darn it. - Well, he said this was the place. - Joe, hey Joe, I think I got one. - That would be a pretty good trick, Billy, since your line is tied to a buoy out there in the middle of the ocean. Idiot. - Hey Joe, look! We got company. - Can't those chicks read? We put a sign up, private beach. - Hey, they ain't half bad. Let 'em stay. What can it hurt, come on. - You wanna tell the boss that? - Oh yeah, I see what you mean. - Billy, go get rid of 'em. I don't care how you do it, but get rid of 'em, understand? I'll keep looking for the drop. - Here, hold this, will ya? - Will you put that down? Right now. - Looks like this could be fun. Them chicks might just get lucky. - What did you say? - Nothin'. - All right. - I don't know, what do you think? - [Michelle] Hey look, someone's coming. - Pardon me ladies, but uh, see this sign? Private beach, it says right here. P-R-I, here you got your pri, V-A-T-E, there you got your vate. Well, okay, so they spelled it wrong, but the point is, this is a private beach, and you're gonna have to get your privates outta here. - Oh, we're sorry. We just wanna be by ourselves and get some sun. - Sun? There ain't no sun in this weather. - Well, we wanna get some fog. - Would you like to get some with us? - What do you think about that? - Do you play basketball? I'm sorry girls, but they're gonna have to leave. I mean, they're all gonna have to leave. - You're right, there's no sun. So, why don't you bring your friend over here and we'll all have some fun in the fog? - Listen, I just can't right now. - Oh, come on. - [Billy] Look, this is a private beach and you're really gonna have to leave, I'm sorry. - Oh? Fishing can't be that much fun now, can it? - Wait miss, you don't understand. - All right, just shut up and take your clothes off. - You really want me bad, don't you baby? Hey, that's cool. If you girls can't live without me, you got it. - Nice day. - Don't do that! Geez. - Looks like your friend caught more than fish. - Oh that ignoramus. - But no use him having all the fun. We've got plenty to share. (playful string and horn music) (licking) (vibrating) - Well, why not? I can't see a thing outta these anyway. But only for a few minutes, okay? - Sure, that's long enough. (laughing) - You uh, really know how to follow orders, don't ya Billy? (moaning) What did you say? Oh, all right. Thought you'd keep all this to yourself, huh? Now girls, I don't have a lot of time. - Get your clothes off. - Exactly. Hey, what is this? - Just drop your pants, stud. - And start talking. - Now what about that shipment? - Does this mean the date's off? (suspenseful music) - Gonna do it. - Oh good, oh good, oh good. - Get up on the rock. Get up on the rock. - Okay, oh good. - Pull! - I am, I'm pulling, I'm pulling. - Harder! - Okay, okay. - [Elaine] Go on, pull it. - I'm pulling, I'm pulling. Oh, oh, oh, oh! Oh. - Come on! - I'm pulling. Wait, wait, wait. Okay, okay. (waves crashing) We got it, we got it! Oh, oh, we got it, we got it. - [Elaine] It's stuck. - Oh no! We got it, we got it. Oh good, oh good. - My hair, damn it, hurry! - Wait. - [Man] Hey, stop, that's not Bill. Let's get 'em! - As fast as you can, hurry, hurry! Oh good, oh good, oh good. - [Man] Come on, let's go. Hurry up. (muffled speech) - Let's get outta here. - Okay. - Be careful. Come on, quick, go as fast as you can. - [April] Okay, okay. - [Elaine] Come on, move! - [Man] Get to shore, let's get 'em! - [Elaine] They're getting close. (speech drowned out by waves crashing) - [Man] Hurry up, get 'em. (waves roaring) - [April] Ow! (men shouting simultaneously) Okay, okay. - Okay sister, drop it. Up against the rocks. - [Man In Vest] I'll get the merchandise. (yelling) (thudding) (grunting) (whacking) (crashing) (smacking) (groaning) - Oh, woops a daisy. Are you okay? (pinging) (cymbals chiming) (grunting) (thudding) (laughing) - [Kako] That was great! Terrific. - I wonder what's in those boats over there? - I don't know, let's go. (gasping) - Oh my god, girls. (suspenseful music) - [Radio] Operating on an anonymous tip, police discovered eight men bound and gagged at the beach today. Evidence of narcotics was discovered, and the men are being held. (dog barking) - Release baby. (snapping) (water trickling) - Nice baby. Good baby, good baby. Nice, nice baby, down, nice baby. (snapping) (panting) (laughing) - Control, Mike, it's all control. We're all beasts in the same jungle. We lose control, we're lost. - Uh huh. - See baby here? He loves me. And if I lost control of him for one instant, he'd tear my throat out. Do you understand me? - I'll take care of things just like we agreed, but I can't control these junkie gangs. - Mike, control is the key of life. We have to control everything, or we will be controlled. Now if you can't do the job-- - Oh, come on now. You know I can do it. I've been controlling things for years. We've both made a lot of money. - Well try to clean this mess up. I'd hate to have to do it myself. - [Mike] Yeah. (clattering) - Was this demonstration really necessary, Ms. Braddock? - I think so. - You're a little out of uniform. You ain't seen nothin' yet. Girls. (heroic horn music) - What's the meaning of this? - It means we can do something about what's happening. This stuff isn't going to hurt anybody, is it Mr. Miller? - Just exactly how far did you go in breaking security, Ms. Braddock? Besides bringing these women here, what else do they know? - Everything. I was trained to take the initiative, use my judgement on the street. Together, all of us, we can make a difference. - I see. You and these untrained women are gonna destroy a processing compound, right? - I wouldn't call it untrained, would you, Elaine? - If I had to choose between the men on the force and these girls, and put my life on the line, I'd go with them. - You have, Ms. Braddock, you have. Where's this compound located? - I'm the only one that needs to know that. - You women may be trained, but you're sure not disciplined. Are you sure about this? - Positive. - Now you all realize that if something goes wrong, you get no help from me or the organization. You're on your own. - We understand. - You're all just crazy enough, it just might work. Now get outta here before I come to my senses and throw you all in jail. - Aw now, you wouldn't wanna throw us all in jail, would you, Mr. Miller? - Get these broads outta here, Braddock. And you report to me. Keep me informed, you understand? - Yes, sir. Come on, girls. - Hey, hey, hey, hey, whadda you doin'? Hey come on, I told you everything you wanted to know! I can tell you, I swear, it's all I know. I swear, I don't know anymore. I told ya all of it. Please, you can't kill me! - Maybe we should give him a chance. - Yeah, yeah. (sighing) - Maybe Kako's right. Maybe we should give him another chance. - Okay, we'll vote on it. Everybody take a full and an empty cartridge. Full round means death. Empty cartridge means second chance. (clanking) You too, Trish. Six empty, one full. Majority rules. - Okay Sticks, you've been missing for over two days now, and your friends are bound to figure you had a part in hitting that shipment at the beach. - And don't go turning on any more kids to anything, anywhere. - 'Cause we'll find out, and we'll come after you, no matter where you are. - I swear, I'll never push the stuff again. - All right, I'm tired of looking at him. Let's get him out of here. (engine revving) (tires squealing) (fast-paced ominous music) - I just wanna talk to ya. (grunting) - Locked. (banging) - [Mike] Hold it a second, I just wanna talk to you. Wait a minute! - Look, just... - Now just take it easy. All I wanna do is talk to ya. - Just get outta my way. Get outta my way! - Don't try it kid. - Just go on. (screaming) Hey! Help, help me! Help me up, please, help me. - All right, I'll help you. First, you gotta help me. You got me into a lotta trouble with the big boss. Now tell me where you been the last few days, and who hit one of our shipments. - Help me up, just pull me up! - No, no, tell me right now. - [Sticks] What? Just please pull me up. - Tell me! - Please, help me, help. (groaning) (screaming) (thudding) (somber music) - [April] So now you know what kind of creeps we're dealing with, and why a nice schoolteacher like me is trying to blow up a building. I'm coming, I'm coming. Ooh. - Come on! - Okay, wait, wait, wait! (exploding) We did it! (speech muffled by exciting music) (all speaking simultaneously) - Wait a minute, they're gettin' away. Hey! (gun firing) (booming) Hoo wee. - There's Terry, look it, there's Terry! - [All Girls] Hi Terry! - [Elaine] Wait a minute. Girls, we've got company. (beeping) They're gonna get our little surprise. - [April] Oh no, oh no, what about Terry? (exploding) (water splashing) (speech drowned out by energetic music) - I'm gettin' outta here. (booming) (laughing) - Did you guys see this girl on her bike? That was neat. - You weren't so bad yourself, girl. - All of us were great. Hey, where's April? - Yeah, yeah. Why not? We're a team, a darn good team. We did it once, we can do it again. (laughing) (water splashing) - Well, hello there. Just come on out of there ladies, all of you. You girls got a little debt to pay, to the tune of, say, a couple million dollars. (laughing) I told you guys it was broads that hit us. Over there. - [Man In Hat] Come on, get your little sweet selves outta there. - You aren't going to hurt us or anything, are you? - Honey, I ain't gonna do anything to you that you ain't gonna enjoy. (laughing) - Just shut up and tie them up. - With pleasure. Now, just hold still. - [Woman] No, you're cutting off the circulation, man. - [Woman] What are you guys gonna do? - [Man] Shut up. - [Man In Light Blue] You guys finish tying them up. I'm gonna go report in. - [Man] Okay. - You ladies wouldn't mind if I borrowed your CB, would ya? (laughing) (tense string and horn music) Breaker, breaker, channel 29, this is little big foot, come in please, come in-- - 'Scuse me, sir. (banging) That's a ten four, buddy. (speech muffled by dramatic music) (man laughing) (gun firing) - Keep 'em covered, April. All right you guys, in the water. - [Man] Okay, okay, all right. (splashing) - Don't worry, honey We ain't gonna do anything to you you're not gonna like. Now, all the way under. - Suck air, baby. (laughing) (playful music) - Good morning, I got a message that you wanted to see me. Hey, that's uh, that's beautiful. Looks sort of like Picasso with the funny eye, and that rose, that's... I guess you're waitin' to hear that I uh, I got the broads that hit us, huh? - Our processing plant, completely destroyed. Better than 10 million dollars worth of good product down the tube. Very frustrating, Mr. Farrell, very frustrating. I talked to you before about control. What plans do you have to control this situation now? - Well, actually I was on the way out to the compound. I thought that maybe I could find some evidence, you know, about who-- - They cut the wires with these. - Hey. I can have these checked out for fingerprints. - Late again. Some dumb schoolteacher. (ominous music) - Okay, don't forget to study for the test tomorrow. - What test? - Oh, it's not gonna be hard. - (laughs) Yeah, but you're not taking it. - You'll pass if you're lucky. - Yeah, maybe. Well, bye Teach. - Be careful. - Miss? May I speak to you for a moment please? - Yes, what can I do for you? - You're Ms. Thomas, right? - Yes. - Yeah, well I'd like to talk to you about my nephew. He's got a little trouble. You're his teacher, I understand. - Oh sure. I have a few moments. What's his name? - You broads really think that you can get away with this, huh? Come on. (groaning) (thudding) - You sure he had Ms. Thomas's picture? - That's right, I saw it. - Trish, I'm so glad you came back. Come over here and help me. No, no, get to a phone and call the girls. Tell 'em I'm bringing him in for a confession so we can find out who the real big shot is. - Just like we did Sticks. This time, I'm gonna use that big sword. - Hurry, and go before we're discovered, and I'll meet ya back at headquarters. (grunting) - Well yeah, she's putting him in the car now, and she's bringing him in. Well, we'll both be there in, in... Oh no! He's got her. He's got April! - [Woman On Phone] Trish, Trish, wait, wait come back. Trish, wait a minute. (suspenseful music) - [Trish] Oh no. (gasping) (tires squealing) (thudding) (moaning) - Damn it. She's gotta call back. She's got to. - What are you guys doing? - Let's see ya swim with this on your leg, baby. (dog barking) - Huh, huh? Oh, oh, no! (splashing) (gasping) (men laughing) (dramatic music) (rapid breathing) - You're a fumbling fool. Fear of death is the quickest way. Just watch and learn. (coughing) (dramatic music) (phone ringing) - Yeah, yeah, I got it. Stay outta sight 'til we get there. We're on our way. Let's go! (men laughing) - Oh miss? Miss, this is really getting quite silly, and I'm running out of patience. - Names, miss. Just give us the names of the others. - I'm the, (gasping) I did it myself. I did it all myself. - Stop, stop! Up the hill. - Any guards? - Two at the gate. - Let's get 'em. Come on, Kako. (suspenseful music) Wait, wait. No, this way. - Hey, psst. (whacking) (grunting) (thudding) - All right, Trish you wait here. - Go easy, we'll follow you. (dog growling) - [Man In Sports Coat] Hold it! - [Kako] Yah! (gun firing) (groaning) - Baby! (dog barking) - Yah! (dog whimpering) - Freeze, sweetheart. (gun firing) (splashing) - You dumb-- (gun firing rapidly) (whacking) - Yah, yah! (yelling) April. (engine revving) (gunfire) (splashing) (suspenseful music) (gun firing) (groaning) (thudding) (coughing) - [Terry] Easy, easy, it's all right now. You're all right. - Take it easy. You all right? (gun firing) Is everybody all right? Is everyone okay? Here, let me help you. Kako, are you all right? - Yeah, yeah I'm all right. (dramatic music) - [Woman] Let's get outta here. (gun firing) - Hello there ladies. Just relax, and don't make any sudden moves. (gun firing) (screaming) - Drop it, mister! - I'll take that. - We'll lock him up. You guys go check on Trish. I'll tell ya what. I'll call Miller, he'll take care of everything. - Hold it! - Wait a minute. Let's tie him up with this. - [Michelle] Get in there. - He's not going anywhere. (dog barking) - You, drop the gun, get down here. Well, you girls did a pretty good job. Nothing to be ashamed of, but you didn't quite have the control you thought you had. I learned a long time ago to eliminate any poss-- (gun firing) (gasping) (grunting) - [April] Oh, Trish! (splashing) - [All Women] Trish! - Trish, you all right? - Did I do all right? Am I one of the seven now? - Yes, little Trish, you're one of us. Just hang on. - Don't worry. A bullet can't kill one of the seven.
