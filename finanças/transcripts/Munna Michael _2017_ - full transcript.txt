Beat him up. - Viju, give me my money. I will take a beer. Yeah... Hey Sam. That's what the doctor said? I don't think the doctor's diagnosis is right? You know what, I'll go call the doctor. Okay? Ana... Munna. Munna... Ana was just... checking my blood pressure. What did the doctor say? When am I going to die? 15th June 2070. 4:30 pm. Right... I am asking you a question. What did the doctor say? You think I am afraid of dying? Never. I raised you, made you capable... and that makes me happy. But I keep telling you... Stop sneaking out to dance. And settle down before I die. Find a corporate job for yourself. You'll look so handsome dressed in tie, and jacket, going to work. Nice, small, house. Beautiful wife. Little kids playing in the garden. Do you get the picture? Settle down. - Dad... Yeah... There's one problem in your test results. The doctor said you're a ticking time-bomb. If we don't treat it soon... Then what? Say it. You've got Lectromania. Wha... What's that? The sickness of giving lectures. Got you. I...I...I lecture you. - Yes, you do. I lecture you. - Since I was a kid. You... I lecture you. - Sorry, father. Bad boy. I don't lecture you. It's my advice, you should quit dancing and settle down. Do you get it? - Chuck it father please. I just want you to be happy, huh! Love you. Hey... Come here, children. You guys are forbidden from entering in here. ACP sir's orders. Not just this place. You're banned from every club. Come on...go home. - Let's leave Munna Bravo. Do something good. Enough acting smart. Come on Kangana, come along. Munna, your boys are not allowed in here. Get lost. Let's try another one, Munna. Bye Munna. Forget it, Munna. We're banned all over the city. Maybe all over this city... ...but, not from the rest of the world. You Leave. "It's me..." "It's just me." "There's no one like me." "It's me..." "It's just me in the front." "And the world comes after me." For his dance classes. Hey... Wait. Do I look like a donkey? If you say so. Hey this is Delhi. So? - So? Do you want to fight? - Munna never fights. He only thrashes. Hey. Oh my god. Open the door. You made a big mistake by raising your hand. Let's settle this on the side. What do you mean settle? Compromise. How much? Well,...the usual rate is 5,000. But I can't take it from you. - Why? If I let you go, then he won't spare me. Who? The same guy whose brother you beat up. Mahindar sir... look what they did to me? They really thrashed me up. Khan. - Yes, boss. Get that Chaudhary. Come on. Yes Mahindar sir. Aren't you Nathu's son? - Yes, Mahindar sir. What are you doing here? - They paid me. Get back in the line... ...or I will beat you up. - Okay, Mahindar sir. Okay. No, boss. I will kill you... Run away. If I ever see you again, I will break your legs. Run away, you... Rascals... Look at them fleeing. Wait...it's from home. What? I'll eat at the hotel today. Yes, you eat your lunch. I am busy at the site, call you later. Put up the board. Go on. Fire some rounds in the air. Fire. Hasn't Chaudhary arrived yet? - Yes, boss. Good morning sir - Send him in. At list take off the sunglasses inside. I was drunk, or else I would've shown him. Call the boy. - Yes, boss. Sir's calling you. Come on. Come on. Chaudhary... Have you lost your mind? Mahindar... I paid you 6000 per sq. ft in cash. For six months you sat on that money... Ate, drank, made merry. And when you got a better offer, you sold them the land. And not to us. I was... I cannot tolerate cheating. Thankfully I know your father. Otherwise, we never pay anyone. Isn't that right, Balli? Yes, Brother. Now get lost. And listen... Give my regards to your father. I know him really well. Get lost. Now get out... get lost. You defeated my brother in dancing. - Hmm. And then you beat him up. - Yes. No one ever lay a finger on my brother. Not even me. I cannot tolerate cheating. You have a sharp tongue too. That's how Mumbaikars are. We are multi-talented. Hey boy, even Shahrukh Khan's from Delhi. Don't try to be over smart. But he's working in Mumbai. You see...we made a bet, and he lost. I am not returning the money. If it's a fight you want, you're welcome. Let's not waste time. Stop arguing about Delhi-Mumbai. Get out, everyone. Go on. Balli, you too. You like making bets, don't you? I can let you go on one condition. There's a guy... You must make him a fantastic dancer in 30 days. And I'll let you go. And if you fail...you're dead. Okay? Who is it? Me. Look, dude, you've got a great hotel. You even look like a gangster. Why do you want to learn dancing? And anyway...I'm more interested in making a quick buck... ...and not tutoring anyone. Go learn from someone else. I had many tutors before... ...but they all ran away. Just name your fee. - I am already making money. I'll give you a blank cheque, you can fill in any amount you like. Say sorry. - What? I said say sorry. - What? You're my student, I am your teacher. Thank you. Have you ever danced before? When Mahindar dances... world watches. "I am done studying." "I am done sighing." "I am done being good." "Now I'm gonna do..." "Dirty Talk" "Dirty Talk" "Dirty Talk..." "Dirty Talk..." "Dirty Talk..." "Dirty Talk..." What happened? How was it? Is it someone's wedding? Are you angry? You can't do it. You're a gangster... Stick to your profession. And stop trying to learn to dance. I am sorry, you can't do it. Stop criticizing me. "You're a gangster..." "Stick to your profession." You're crushing my moral. I will shoot you. How? I'm currently 42. I might be lacking in dance. But I was a National Champion in running. Should I shoot you? You never went to school. Why? If you shoot the teacher... ...who's going to teach you how to dance? Teach me, please... Teacher... Please teach me. Okay,...but you must do exactly as I say. - Done. As in...when you will sleep, wake up, what to eat, what to drink... Drink? - No drinking. You understand? Lesson no. 1; Feel the music. Feel it. - Feel it, right... Watch me. "Here we go now!" "Here we go now!" "Raise your hands like this..." "...and move your feet like this." "Keep swaying to the beat..." "...like the way you want." "I am feeling oh, oh, oh..." "Don't stop yourself."

Your dad will come there and sort out everything. I'll catch a train tonight... ...and be there in the morning. - Dad, please. Just take your medicines on time. Please you just relax. Don't worry about that. I'm taking my medicines. - Hey Munna. You just take care. Where are you going? What happened? Will you say something? Open the door, Munna. Who is it at this hour? I've been calling you for so long. Mahindar Sir's on the line. Who is this Mahindar? Dad, something's come up suddenly. Oh my god...who's that guy looking like a bear. What does he want at this hour? Dad, it's a corporate job, can't help it. Okay, got to go now. Catch you later. - Munna. Here, talk to him. Yeah. - Bro, I can't sleep, what do I do? Do you want me to sing you a lullaby? What happened? Nothing interests me anymore. Can I drink? - Not at all. So why don't we practice? - Not now, in the morning. I've to take care of few murders in the morning. I'll charge double. - Ok. Coming. Hey... 10 guys beating up 1 guy... This happens only in Mumbai. Hey...get lost quietly. Don't interfere in our fight. Munna never fights. He only thrashes. Are you ok? Come. Hello, mother. Why did you venture out alone? Why do you keep this army with you? I've brought my friend over for lunch... ...and you're insulting me. My mother. - Hello. Bless you, son. I see...so he's the guy from Mumbai. Let's open up the bottles on that note. You are supposed to ask for water first. Not jump straight to alcohol. What kind of hospitality is this? Bro...your condition about no alcohol, we'll have to drop it. My father isn't going to listen. What condition.? Come on. That's all...move aside. Here... That's enough, please. Have some more. You're a young man. You should eat to stay healthy. Here. Here, son. Take one more. Come on. Yes... - Eat properly. Balli...close the door. Yes. Bro...from today you're a member of my family. What are you doing? - Calm down, father. What the hell are you up to Mahindar? If you want to be my brother, give me your hand. Give me your hand. Open the bottles. Open up boys. Do you know what that sparkling thing out there is? That's DLX. And this place where you're sitting. It's Lal Dora. One day a 19-year-old boy woke up here. He started seizing the villager's lands slowly. And sold it to these DLX people at four times the rate. Rascals. Take it. And now the villagers salute that 19-year-old boy. And you saved that 19-year-old boy's life... ...who is better known as Mahindar Fauji. Ask for anything you want. Bro...please relieve me from tutoring you. What? What are you saying? That's not possible. I can give my life, but this is impossible. What's the problem? I mean...why are you so obsessed about dancing? You want to know? - Yes. Let me show you. "When my silver anklet tinkles..." "...it makes boys skip a beat." "When my silver anklet tinkles..." "...it makes boys skip a beat." "Looking at me sway my hips..." "...boys chill their eyes." "Everyone sways..." "Everyone sways..." "Everyone sways with me...when I shake to the beat." "Everyone sways with me...when I shake to the beat." "From UK to Nainital... when I shake to the beat." "Everyone's sways...when I shake it." "When I sway...it's blows everyone's mind away." "Boys are always ready...to dance with you." "When I sway it's blows everyone's mind away." "Boys are always ready to dance with you." "When the bangles on my wrist move..." "...makes everyone's heart beat faster." "When the bangles on my wrist move..." "...makes everyone's heart beat faster." "As I groove to the rhythm..." "...boys thump their feet." "Everyone's sways..." "Everyone's sways..." "Everyone sways with me... when I shake to the beat." "Everyone sways with me...when I shake to the beat." "From UK to Nainital... when I shake to the beat." "Everyone sways with me... when I shake to the beat." "when I shake to the beat." So what do you think about my problem? Quite a beautiful problem. I mean...she's a fantastic dancer. Since the day I first saw her... I truly fell in love. I just want her love. True love. Just like college kids make girlfriends. I want to make her my girlfriend. So the plan is... On Valentine's Day, I want to dance my heart out for her. And impress her. Look, bro, you're 42. Why are you chasing a 21-year-old girl? What do you mean? Should I abduct her? Be the villain in her life? Can't a 42-year-old be a hero? You really love her a lot? - More than you think. With feelings. Did you ever give her a hint about your feelings? I don't support cheap gimmicks. I meant walking up to her and saying hello, or giving her a gift. Or just jump on the stage and dance your heart out for her? You're right. - What? We'll buy a gift for her tomorrow, first thing in the morning. How can I help you, sir? - Yeah-yeah, sure. Hi, we'd like to buy a dress, please. - Sure. It should be expensive. - Okay. What is the size, sir? Size. I didn't check her size. I've no idea either. I need to know the size, sir. - Just give us a second, please. Sure. - Thank You. You didn't check? - No, I didn't. You know what...just turn. What? Just a minute. She's just like you... Just her waist's thinner, legs are longer, and her back... I mean she looks healthier... And from the front... That mannequin in the front, I think it's the right size. Yes, pack that. You'll get us in trouble. Look. You should write a note with this. In her praise. Do you know English? - Yes, why not, sure. Bro, it's done. "Darling your dancing saw... good was." What does that mean... It means I saw your dance, I really liked it. "Hope..." "Hope do you bad not accepting my little gift." Meaning I hope you won't mind and accept this small gift... I think it's best we don't send this to her I've also written one in Hindi. Same thing in Hindi. This will do. This one's fine. Fine, give this to her. Hold on...why me? You're in love with her. You give it to her. Bro... didn't Hanuman delivered Lord Rama's message? Fine... And yes...don't forget to check if she has an affair. What if she does? - Then shoot the rascal. I've given you full power of attorney. See you. Bro, I'll show you a clip. Look...look at this one. Show me too. She's amazing. - She's really great. I swear...this is fun. She is looking hot. She's looking gorgeous. Bro, send it to me as well. Keep watching... she's amazing. Yeah, man. Calm down. Here she comes. Baby doll...you danced so well. Madam...this calls for a selfie. You guys want a selfie? - She's agreed. Come on, guys. Let's take a selfie. Come on. Come here. - You wait. Rascals...scoundrels...get lost. You want to selfie? Go take a selfie with your mother. Hello, are you with them? I just came here to give you this gift. - Gift? For me? What are you trying to do? Do you want to be friends with me? Take me on a date? Listen up, I am not interested in all this at all. Look, I am just a courier boy. How did you know I am Dolly? I was right there when those guys were teasing you in the club. I see...so why didn't you save me? - Because I am not a hero. This is for you. Who sent this? You know...usually, these things have a note inside. Just have a look. Nice bike. Is it yours? Will you drop me at sector 15, please? - Get on. Stop-stop...we're here. Impressive...you didn't hit the brakes even once. Take my advice... Stop being this delivery boy. Dream big. Do what you're made for? What are you made for? Definitely not for that club I work for. Now leave. Don't just keep staring. You won't let her free. You won't... - What are you doing? Say that again. Say it. I will let her go... - What happened? You? I was just delivering this letter. And ran into my friend. - What is it? Is it from Meerut? Tell her. No...It's an offer from Hotel Blue Star. They're inviting you to be their club's lead dancer. What? - Yes. Oh my, God. I still can't believe this is actually happening. Did you like the dress? - How did you know it was a dress? I asked around at the office. Are you trying to hit on me? Why do feel that? Because you're not a courier boy. You don't have any delivery bags. You know, you're right. I was fired from the job today. I went to collect my salary cheque. I saw a letter addressed to you and thought I should deliver it to you. Do you have a girlfriend? - No. I have a friend, should I introduce you two? - Go on. Give me your number. 98210...11722. Save it...as Dolly, not 'hottie'. What's your name? - My name's Munna. Munna Michael. So...you don't have a boyfriend? Why should I tell you? Just... Thank you. Why are you paying? - Get used to it. Listen...pick me up tomorrow. Excuse me, where...why? Hotel Blue Star... The letter states that I have to start tomorrow. You're just taking advantage now. You're my good luck, that's why. Now stop giving me attitude. Come on. Let's go. You have set up everything. Thank you, buddy. So...does she have a boyfriend? - No. So what's next? You're having dinner with her tonight, after her show. And yes, my job's done. Why? Are you not coming along? If she finds out who I am, she will stop believing me. - Excuse me. Sir, open the shirts. Why should I open your shirt? Take your shirt off, brother, not hers. To colour your chest hair. You should learn some English now. I quit so you could go to school, Understand? Who was that? - Father. You should let me talk to him? I could've taken some advice. Hey... Stop putting food on your face. No. Thanks Are you sure you won't come in? I have no interest in Dance, thank you. Oh, I will introduce you to that girl really soon. Okay bye. That's enough, get out. - Ok sir. I happened your fan. Heart doing always watch you. - Thanks. Can we talk in Hindi? - Can. You do. - I do? I want... I want to be your friend. - Only friendship. I love art. My dream was to go to college, to become a dancer. You didn't go to college? - I did. But they graduated me on the first day. - What? I broke my teacher's head. - I understand. But I will show you my dance. Better than those college boys. Very urgent. So...we friend? - Yes, just friends. Gift. Your new flat. No-no, Mahindar. I cannot accept this. Mahi. - Mahi? Just Mahi. Even artists have a right to live a good life. And you've added to the glory of my hotel. Please... I intist. Please. Okay. Get the food rascals. Yes sir. Special for you. Want a beer? See...new car. Mahindar also gave me a 2BHK flat. Cheers. - Cheers. What about that girl you were going to introduce me to? Actually, she's got malaria. I love Delhi. I ran away from home for Mumbai. But that bloody Gemini brought me here. And I got stuck in Jassi's contract. Bloody Jassi.... But I won't stop here. I want to win the Dancing Star trophy. Mumbai. My ultimate dream. And then films, endorsements, ads... I'll make millions. Such limited dreams. At least I have dreams. You don't even have a single dream. Courier Boy...think big. My song.

Your contract with Jassi. Such temper... I hope you don't have any problem here. Tell me if you do. Look...I can be really handy. What do you think? Mahindar will let you go? He's given you these facilities for free? He'll make you his mistress. Get out or else I will kill you. Get out. I said get out. - I am going. I am going. Go. I me leaving.

Have you ever loved anyone? Tell me. Have you ever loved anyone? Just my father. Yeah... You would've realized if your father had left you. I will get your father treated. He'll be alright.

Let's take an off tomorrow. Spend some time together, like old days. Ok. No, guys. Tomorrow, finally I get to say dialogues after 6 weeks. The ape army is destined to die today. Apes Attack! Cut! Cut! Cut! He got hurt. - Oh, man... His first dialogue was good. Look, even the tail's come out. Listen clearly and get it through your thick skull. You might be from Mumbai, but I am from Meerut. I am going to win this show. I never lost to a girl. - But you will today. In fact, you should get used to it. Did you hear? Get used to it. Let's go guys. Munna? Hi. - Dolly. Thank God. You arrived just in time. Now my good luck's with me. How? The audition results are be announced. I am participating under my real name. Deepika Sharma. - I see... Come with me. And welcome back to lawman presents dancing star powered by PVC pipes? No rules just dance. Yes, no rules just dance. India's first ever dancing show... ...where the contestants will perform in a free format. Here... I kept my word as a friend. I completely trusted you. You're my brother. Just take care yourself. What Balli did was absolutely wrong. And I apologize on his behalf. Excuse me...I love you. A lot. More than anyone else in this world. Just don't ever leave me again. You're married, Mahindar. That marriage was against my will. And marrying you is my dream. Just say yes. You will never have to dance again in front of anyone. Just me and you. Just us. I'll keep you really happy. I'll even get a plastic surgery done... ...to look young again if you ask me to. Money is not a concern, maam. - Don't talk about money. Show me yellow colour. - Why are you sitting alone? Come here. Madam it is a little expensive. Stop talking about money. You always come here. Where is this Munna? I'm giving you a treat since I got selected. Enough... Come on, I'm not going to ask again. Enough for today. Thank you. Fine...I'll drink it. Check this out. The show organizers gave me this group for the next round. How is it? Okay. I don't like them. I don't like them either. Very okay, right? - Yeah. Why am I so sleepy today? It's quite late already. I must win this show. At any cost. Not for money, but for my father. I've to prove to him that I wasn't wrong. I ran away from home to become a dancer. Is it a crime to become a dancer? Does everyone have to be a doctor or an engineer? I wish I could meet him. And give him a tight hug. And be his little girl again. Maybe he'll forgive me when I win this show. Why am I feeling so sleepy? I never wanted Mahindar's money. I just wanted to be out of that stupid contract. Don't ever leave me. Ok? Goodnight. Hello. I've been calling you all day, why aren't you answering? Forget it. Where is Dolly? Hello. What happened? I haven't found her yet. You promised me!

You go that way. Stop. - Catch her. Wait... catch her. Catch her. Go that way, catch her. Catch here... - There she is. There she is...that way. Hey...wait. Wait... stop. Wait...you can't escape.

Get up. You're so heavy. Wake up. Mahindar's coming. Get up. Get everyone out. Everyone get out. What's up! Get out. Why are they all so drunk? I sent them to different bars to find Dolly. But they got drunk instead. I had to hire locals for help. Bro, I saw Dolly. What are you saying? With a guy. He was wearing a t-shirt like you. Maybe it was you? - Are you drunk? If it was him, why would he run? Go and lick some lemon. Come. So...what's the report here? The truth is...even I saw her. Soon I will have her address. I have an entire team working on it. But how did you guys suddenly come here? I came here to find her. And I will take her back with me. Go back. Switch to the other channel. Go back. Go back. Go back. And ladies and gentlemen, don't touch your remotes. Bro, I have an idea... - Just a minute. Because Lawman Page 3 presents Dancing Star powered by PVC Pipes... ...is going to be back. We can find Dolly where she's shooting. Here? Pull some strings, maybe we'll find her. How can you guarantee that you'll find her there? Yes...nothing can be guaranteed. Doesn't matter if we don't find her. We might run into Shahrukh Khan. Even he's from Delhi, we'll click a picture with him. Are you here to click pictures? Mahindar, cool. Cool. Cool. My heart says we might find her there. Fine, let's go tomorrow morning. I'll wait right here. I am ready. How will we do it, Munna? The Semis start at 12 o'clock tomorrow. Not to worry. No one can stop you from performing. We'll handle it. Listen carefully, everyone. What you have to do. Yeah, go on. - Get to the Mumbai Central railway station immediately.

She's on the way. Look ahead. Let's go, let's go. - Move back. Look ahead. Not here...go ahead...ahead. Look ahead...in the next compartment. Look here... - Next one. Is your information correct? - Absolutely. Stop the train! Do something. Shoot the tires. It's made of iron. Do something. I see her, Mahindar. I see her. Come on. - Dolly. Get down Dolly, get down from the train. Wait, Dolly. Hey Dolly. - Wait, Dolly. Dolly, wait. Hey... Hey - Hey Get up. The train's gone. The train's gone. Gone...Dolly is gone. You... - Hey?

We also hurl it on our enemies. yeah...bullet. It explodes...makes a lot of noise. What is it now? Firecracker. Think big. Big? Look at me. Bomb. Bomb. Sir, I'll have to deboard you, please come with me. Why, ma'am? - Sir, because of security reasons. He has used a wrong word. But he just said bomb. Sir, you must come with us too. Please get up. What's wrong, madam? All he said was Bomb. Sir, I am sorry, but you must alight too. Please get up. You fool, never say the word 'Bomb' on an airplane. Sir, please get up. He's gone too. You shouldn't have said 'Bomb'. Madam, it's not a big thing... Dolly. Call me. Excuse me sir. I didn't say anything. - Do you want to? No - Buckle up. Seat belts. - Ok Hello where are you going? - We really fooled him, brother. Where were you guys? What happened? - Look at the time. She's been calling us. Come on...hurry up. They are here. - What timing. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks Munna. - Hurry up. Call the Railway Minister. Find out when will the train arrive. We've deceived others all the time. Don't you think we're being deceived today? She's not alone, someone's helping her. What? Stop, stop, stop. Guys, where is Munna? Oh... Munna. Who is she calling? Calling. Calling. Get out of here, you guys. Leave her...leave her alone. Hi my good luck, where are you? I must tell you something important. - Me too. What? - Let's meet up. Is it important? Very important. Meet me at our hangout. Okay. I am coming. "I feel alive every time we meet" "You are like the air I breathe." "This feeling, I never felt like this before..." "I want to convey what my heart's feeling right now." "Whenever I'm in love..." "Whenever I'm in love..." "Every time I'm in love..." "Has to be you." "Whenever I'm in love..." "Whenever I'm madly in love..." "Every time I'm in love..." "Has to be you." "You're the destination..." "...you're the journey, all my moments converge with you." "Every path I take leads to you..." "...there's nowhere I've to go." "Whenever I walk without you..." "...the earth slips from under my feet." "Whether life has anything else in store for me or not..." "...but there's one thing destined to be." "Whenever I'm in love..." "Whenever I'm in love..." "Every time I'm in love..." "Has to be you." "Whenever I'm in love..." "Whenever I'm madly in love..." "Every time I'm in love..." "Has to be you." Munna. Munna. We're in the finals. We're in the finals, Munna. Two days to go. It's all thanks to you, Munna. If it wasn't for you, I... I don't know. I've made up my mind... ...you're going to be my partner in the finals. So you were saying, you wanted to tell me something important. Hi Munna. What are you doing here? Did you find Dolly? Didn't you find her in Kandapurram? She would've been with me if I did. So...any news about her. Not yet, bro. But we'll find something soon. Fine. I am going back to Delhi. Why? Well...the currency ban has thrown a spanner in my work. Otherwise, I wouldn't have returned without her. Okay. See you. Father? Father? Yeah. At least say bye to your father. Hey take one sip no. Say thank you. I gave brother Mahindar this idea to take him along to Delhi. Your father is like our father. We'll get him treated. You have 24 hours, just do the job. Munna. Munna. See you in Delhi. Cheers. - Yeah.. Delhi. "You made my heart beat, and you broke it." "You made my fate..." "...and let go of my hand." "I never thought that the shore..." "...will betray the ocean." Ohh sorry, sorry. "It knows...that you're a traitor..." "...yet my heart keeps saying." "Whenever I'm in love..." "Whenever I'm in love..." "Always has to be you." "Whenever I'm in love..." "Whenever I'm in love..." "Always has to be you." I guess even I would've done the same thing... ...if I would be in similar situation like you. If fate's with us, we'll definitely meet for the last dance. "It knows...that you're a traitor..." "...yet my heart keeps saying." "Whenever I'm in love..." "Whenever I'm in love..." "Always has to be you." Why did you run away? Dance is my dream. - Why didn't you tell me? I would've made a special TV show for you. 1st, 2nd, 3rd, you would've won all the trophies. I may be rustic, but also a cool dude with forwarding thinking. I watch all English films. I... - You don't believe me, do you. You don't believe me. Watch me. Especially for you. "I've got the swag." "You've got the swag." - Listen... - Wait. "I've got the swag." "You've got the swag." "I've got the swag." "You've got the swag." "I've got the swag." "You've got the swag." "Swag..." "Raise your hands like this..." "...and move your feet like this." "Keep swaying to the beat..." "...like the way you want." "Raise your hands like this..." "...and move your feet like this." "Keep swaying to the beat..." "...like the way you want." "I've got the swag." "You've got the swag." "I've got the swag." "You've got the swag." "Raise your hands like this..." "...and move your feet like this." "Keep swaying to the beat..." "...like the way you want." "I've got the swag." "You've got the swag." "I've got the swag." "You've got the swag." "I've got the swag." Can dance you with me... please. Mahindar, I love someone else. Who? Don't say that. - It's the truth. You can shoot me if you want, but I won't stay. Hey... Follow her. Follow her. Come on, let's follow her. Why did brother let her go? Dolly's gone. Where is he lost? Get the car. Your boss is a great guy. What does he do? Business? I'll go fill the form. - Go on. We're free, Munna. I clearly told him everything. And he didn't stop you? - I didn't stay. Only 7 hours left for the finale. We'll be there on time. I cannot leave my father here. You're forgetting, Munna. The winning prize money is 10 million. Look, Dolly, I promised my father. I won't turn dance into my profession. Do you want to slog in a job for the rest of your life? For Mahindar, or maybe someone else. When will you live for yourself, Munna? Or maybe you don't love dance at all. Since the time I remember... ...every moment, Michael Jackson's poster on my wall would talk to me. "Come on, Munna. Get up." "Dance as if there is no tomorrow." "As if no one's watching." When father used to go out to work... ...I would watch Michael Jackson's cassettes, records, and videos... ...hidden in his closet. I only had one dream, Dolly. Someday...I wanted to do, what my father couldn't. My parents threw me in a dumpster when I was born. As I grew up, life left my dreams in that same pile of garbage. No, Dolly. I cannot tell my father. What did this slap prove? You still got a strong body. - It's a dancer's body. Your father won't die so easily, Munna. What were you telling her? I don't want a life... which crushes your dreams. You want to see me happy, don't you? Then you must prove me wrong. Now go...and prove that Michael lives forever. Will you do it? Father. How much longer? - What is your status, guys? Where the hell is she. So sorry. Please, relax. Just five minutes. - Do you guys want to miss the camera rehearsals? Listen, we'll do a run-through as soon as we get there. Dolly is fully prepared. - Since, how long you are dating? See you, bye. Actually I..! You fool! You've dashed. Who issued you a license? Get out of our way, Balli. So that you can run away with our property? She's a girl, not a property. Whatever, she's ours. Let the girl go with us, and you can get lost, Munna. She already discussed this with Mahindar. My brother has gone blind in love. But I can see everything. That day I was drunk, but not today. And you're all alone. Don't even think about getting into a fight. You know... Munna never fights. He only thrashes. Get the girl. Go get her. No-no, no touching. Don't touch don't touch. Father... Hey! Leave him! Just leave! Hey Munna, hey Munna. Munna. You too come! Hey, Munna! Just leave him! Leave! Leave! Leave it! No father! Father! Munna. What happened? Munna. Munna. Munna please.

Munna - Stop, Mahindar. Munna - Munna. Mahindar please. Don't make a scene of our friendship. Even I can punch back. Friendship? What you did, you call it friendship? Mahindar, I didn't do anything wrong. I should've shot you on the first day itself. And I shouldn't have saved your life... ...when those guys were trying to kill you. You know I love her. Doesn't matter whether you love her or I do. What matters is whom she loves. Do you love him? What's the difference between me and him? You won't understand, Mahindar. - Then explain it to me. What's the difference between me and him? Just the dance, right? I'll work hard day and night. And be better than him. I treated you like a brother. I trusted you. - I never broke your trust. Fine. Say it... Just say it once. You two never had a thing before... ...and there's nothing between you two now. There's a lot going on between us. I love her. Since the time I saw her. But I always stopped myself... ...because you are like a brother to me. We shook our bloodied hands. You tried really hard, Mahindar. But you couldn't get over your habit. Seizing what belongs to someone else. But a woman is not like some piece of land you can seize. You want to kill me, don't you? So kill me. Hey Munna. Kill me or else I will kill you. Can't you adjust me somewhere in your life? Maybe in some nook or corner? That's the difference between you and him. Listen. Move back. If you two ever have a fallout. Or you start having fights or differences. Or you ever feel that he's having an affair outside... ...then call me first. Listen...take care of her. If you mistreat her, I'll fly down to Mumbai... ...and empty all the bullets on you. if you kill me... from, whom will you learn dance? I've perfected the moves. Once more time... together. Last time.
