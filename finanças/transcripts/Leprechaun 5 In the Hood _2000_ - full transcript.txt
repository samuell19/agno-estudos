For he has delivered unto me... the worst of Satan's sinners. Praise God. Reverend Hanson, we need sanctuary in your sanctuary. We tryin' to hide from Mack Daddy. He's about to go on a killin' spree. We're the spree he's tryin' to kill. You're saying you need a place to slither away and hide out? Yeah, just for one day, then we're outta here. Let's see... hotel rates run about... We give you $50 dollars, and we square. That's nice, real nice. But there's one more thing. What? Our musical entertainment for this morning got cancelled. Seems, the lead singer got his ass arrested again. I know you boys are musically inclined... and I suspect you might be available for... one song. It's so good... to see a full house, in the Lord's house. Amen. As we pass the collection plate... I want you to remember one thing. The Lord, I say... the Lord, sees everything. The Lord don't like cheap. So I want you to dig deep into your pockets, now... and show your love. But first, about our musical entertainment for today... We have three young lads coming to you... straight from the Southside of Jerusalem. I said, the Southside of Jerusalem. I want you to make these boys feel welcome today. Bring 'em on down, and show some love. Lord works in mysterious ways... Amen, man. The Lord is good. Jesus loves me, this I know... If he don't, I'll find a... ho'. His mama's name was-- Mary... Jo. And his disciples was-- ... some bad mo' fo's... That's fine, fellas, that's fine. The Lord has heard many a strange tongue in this house. And we have learned not to judge what we see... but to the content, and the fiber of a young-- Yo, that's... Coolio. Jesus loves me, this I know... If he don't, I find a ho'. His mama's name, was Mary Jo... His disciples was some bad mo' fo's. Little ones, goin' out to the crack house... They're all weak, Jesus gave a shout out... 'cause we belong... To the fold, we gone before long.> Jesus loves me... - I don't know... Jesus loves me... - The hell if I know. If Jesus loves me, then it's my day. We better pray... - Or he'll make us pay. The Lord's name, I take it in vain. Why don't you, Jesus, come stop the pain? Jesus works in a mysterious way. That ain't no answer, I'm gonna do it my way. Jesus loves us, we don't know... Jesus loves us? The hell if we know. Jesus works in a mysterious way... That ain't no answer. We gonna do it our way. Yeah. Three bad boys. Give it up, come on, now. Damn. You believe me now? No wonder Mack Daddy was so pissed off. This is fortune, right here. That's right. You thinkin' what I'm thinkin'? That's the key, man. The key to everything we ever wanted. Man, that's the key to our goddamn coffin. Y'all must be forgettin' Mack Daddy gonna kill our ass... if he don't get that shit back. We went in his house, fucked his shit up... You think he'll let us live, 'cause we gave him his flute back? Aw, shit, man. We're about to find out. Oh, shit. I'm sure the motherfuckers is up there. We don't go down without a fight.

The flute belongs to him, anyway. Fuck that little motherfucker. I should've killed him a long time ago. Fuck him. You need to figure out what you're going to do about him... because he's right behind your ass. I'm supposed to fall for that shit? That's the oldest trick in the book. You gotta come better than that, nigga. Blow this motherfucker's head off. With pleasure. Did somebody say, ? Hallelujah. You were sayin'? I'll get back with you niggas later. All right, dammit, what the hell is goin' on...?! What the hell you boys think you're doin'? Man, we got the whole world after our ass. ? - Only the bad motherfuckers.

As they say, lad, Now live with the thought. You were almost a star. Ladies... Fuck you. No, Post... no. No! Man, we gotta go. It wasn't supposed to be like this. We was gonna make the climb with the positive shit. That was a long time ago. So, it's over? Stray died for nothing? A stinkin' corpse in a shitty car to be found by some wino? Man, it's over. What are we gonna do? I don't know. It's over, Post. Go home, man. Go home. Does she meet with your approval? She's the bomb. Who's that? You must be one of Post's little friends. You must want some of that food I made. Ooh, child. You got the arthritis real bad. Your little hands is all knotted up... You need some good food in your stomach. That's what you need. Now, go on, and go wash up. Go on, go wash them filthy little hands. Let some hot water run down over them. I'm gonna feed you, on account of your hands is knotted up... and you can't hold these here utensils. Good. - Thank you. Stray... We goin' to Vegas, baby! We gonna be large! Stray... Yo, Post, it's all right. It's me. Butch... what's up, man? I don't want you goin' by yourself, man. Goin' where? To get the Leprechaun. To get that flute back. How do you know I'm goin'? - Ain't you? Yeah, I guess I am. What the hell is that around your damn head? I got a plan, man. Yo, Post I was reading earlier... Leprechauns is rumored to be the dark elves of Satan. Each with his own pot of gold. They so small, peeps are always tryin' to capture 'em. The gold is the ransom for their freedom. Anybody fuckin' with their shit... is hunted down and killed in a most brutal manner. Yeah, no shit. So, what's your plan? This. Weed? Man, this ain't just weed, Post. This weed's got clovers in it. Four-leaf clovers. What? According to this book... a leprechaun can lose his powers temporarily... if he's hit with the essence of a four-leaf clover. How are we supposed to find the Leprechaun? I was sneaking around the Golden Parrot. The Leprechaun got a goddamn room upstairs. He got them zombie ho's hypnotizing people. Taking them up to him, every night. Word? What for? - I don't know... but they don't be comin' back downstairs after they go up. I think he's fuckin' 'em to death. We gotta get in there, get him stoned off these clovers... grab the flute, and run like hell while he's still trippin'. That's a good plan, Post. How are we supposed to get close to his ass? Only one way, bro'. Remember, Mack Daddy's still out there. he gonna be comin' after our ass, too. Fuck Mack Daddy. Ain't nothin' but a hip-hop thang. Business in the hood. Let's do this. Lep in the hood... come to do no good. What happened? Tell me where the Leprechaun is. It's okay, just tell me where he is, and I'll let you go. Damn, Post. You look good, for real. Fuck you, nigga. You ready for this shit? I'm ready for this shit, man. Let's do it. Mr. Leprechaun? Mr. Leprechaun? Yo... Mr. Leprechaun! Gotcha some new, fresh, ho' meat... and some special weed. Come closer, come closer my fresh young lass. Let me take a look at you, before I tap your ass. Sit down, sit down, my healthy filly. You're about to meet a club named, . They say in the hood, you're never down... unless you've the courage to go downtown. Come on, man. On to Vegas, baby. - All the way for Stray, man. Butch...? Not in a dress, Post... You're gonna be okay, man. Is there pussy in heaven, Post? Okay, little girls, come on out! You can't hide. It's goin' down. Come on out, bitches. Mack Daddy wants his flute. What's up, ? Man, I must say, you are fine. Are you finished playing? Gimme the goddamn flute. Fuck you, motherfucker. Oh, yeah, fuck me... You look real tough, you got a gun and everything... but you ain't about to kill shit. Plus, you're forgetting about the little motherfucker upstairs. There's only one way to deal with him, and that's me. I got the one thing that can put that leprechaun on ice forever. So, what you gonna do, tough guy? You gonna try to kill me... or are we gonna work together and kill this motherfucker? 'Cause you ain't no motherfucking gangster. I'm supposed to trust you now? I wouldn't advise you to trust me; that'd be the worst thing you could do. But right now, we got no options. And you really ain't got no options. You ain't no motherfucking gangster. Get that gun out of my face. You ain't about to kill nothin'... Cross-dressing impostor! For a foe of mine, you've done quite well. Now, I'll take me flute, and send you to hell. If this is to be Post's last stand... you'll have to take this flute from me cold, dead hand. I'll take it from you, homie, you'll see... 'cause you know the Lep is the real O.G. What are you gonna do about Mack Daddy? Behind me? A valiant try, and right on cue... but if I fall for that, I'm as stupid as you. Mack Daddy ain't dyin' today. Motherfucker.
