But it's broken. - Son of a bitch. - What? What about your High School Equivalency classes? Did you quit? Drop the nonsense. I even quit school. Why would I study? So you bought that with the money? Yes. And I'm not taking the test. Then what? You don't have any skills. Will you just loaf around and live a useless life like this? Like you're living such a great life, Mom. Don't. Using your volleyball skills to slap your son. Do you call that a useful life? You don't even have money to pay for college. Fuck. Are you really going to a deserted island? Why aren't you saying anything? Where are you going? I don't know. I'll just go wherever. You should decide where to go first. Something's bound to turn up. Whatever, you idiot. Whenever you get drunk, you cry, saying how you pity your mom. You said you'd take her to the deserted island too. Come on, man. Let's get a job together. You go by yourself. Shit.

He's ugly as fuck, right? He's way worse in person. Why did you call? I saw your mom today. So what? What about her? She was talking with other ladies. Things didn't look good. Maybe she's up to something. Don't call me because of that kind of matter. I'm sure something weird was going on. Hang up. Crazy bastard. What is he up to? Gosh, I want to kill him. How can you eat after getting beaten up like that? How can I punch a girl back? What? A girl? You got hit by a girl? You yellow head. You're ridiculous! Hit by a girl? Don't laugh. This loser got hit by a girl. How about a love shot? - Okay. - Love shot. Did you see his smile? Look at his face. You're back? Say hi. You've met them before. What are you doing? I don't want men coming over. We'll leave soon. Come and have a drink. Right. We brought good food. Come and join us. What? Don't ruin the mood. Hey. You're embarrassing us.

What the heck is your problem? Hey. Are you crying because you miss your mom? No way. We don't talk anymore. For the rest of your life? She said she hates everything I do. So it'll be good for her not to see me. Losers like you need a good beating to knock some sense into them. Your mom must be a saint. Getting hit doesn't solve anything. Gosh... If that's true, then you didn't get hit once, right? Look how you turned out. I'm suddenly so sleepy. Gosh, you're so annoying. You seem to be good at taking a beating. Did you take boxing lessons? Shut up and fight, asshole. - Shit. - Are you okay? What's this? - Crazy bitch. - He's bleeding. Amazing. Do you think you're a boxer? They don't do this in the ring, right? Tell me. Don't fight in here. Look at all the broken stuff! Get back here. Hey! Redhead! Fuck. You're dead once I get you! Move it. I said move it. Damn it. Hey! Why didn't you get her? Fuck! Gosh, it's hot.

You better not run away this time, fucking bitch. - Get her in the car. - What? - Get in. - What's going on? Hey, you two. She may be a weirdo, but what are you two doing to a girl? Mind your own business and go away, jerk. Come here. Why are they taking you? I should be the one hitting you. Who the hell is this yellow head? - Let go. Let her go now! - Let go. Get lost, you fucker! - You son of a bitch. - Go! Geo-seok! You're dead meat. You bastard! - Let go. - Geo-seok! Bro! Get in! - Asshole! - Fuck. Let go. Hey! Stop! I'll call the cops.

Let's go. I know your faces. Watch it. Stop. Come back here! Why did you attack me? We're on the same team. Go down a bit. Yes, right there. You should go to the hospital. Gosh. I'll be fine in a few days. You think you can take on anyone because you learned boxing somewhere? See? That's why you're in this shit. People aren't all nice like me, you know. I should go. Sorry for all the trouble. But... Take care, then. What should I do about her? Relax. You didn't pay enough for the jajangmyeon last time. Bring it. Say thank you to the others for me. And you... If you can't fight, don't step in. You'll end up dead. I'll get you next time. I won't go easy on you. Man, I'm the retard. Right, I forgot. I was the retard. WELCOME Stop staring. You love me or something? You act all strong, but then you chicken out like that? People have their reasons. Cowardly pig. Jajangmyeon! It's here. It'll be 28,000 won, please. - Thank you. - Thanks. Take care. TAEK-IL TOASTS - We have so much money. - So much money! TANGSUYUK JANGPUNG CHINESE RESTAURANT TAEK-IL WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO STOP ACTING LIKE A REBEL? MOM I had to go somewhere. Sorry, it's late. Thank you for the shoes. Where did you get beaten again? What happened? What happened to your face? Just hide somewhere if you're looking like that. Don't you have anywhere to go?

She didn't pay again? No, sir. Then I need to pay you exactly 2,550,000 won. It's the first pay you've ever gotten, right? Congratulations. GO TAEK-IL Thank you. Congratulations. Taek-il, baby. I can't believe you lasted this long. Why don't you treat us with your money? I'm not treating someone with no sense of loyalty. What? I'm only treating the boss and Gu-man. Don't come. What do you mean don't come? Treat all of us. Don't come. Don't drink so much, kid. I'm paying for my drinks. Who cares? Why did you come? How much did you eat? You pay for yourself. Taek-il. How about visiting your Mom? I don't want to. Why? Kid. Our boss is much older and wiser. And he's not going to live forever. Show him some respect. Say, I'm sorry, but I don't want to, sir. I told you before. All we do is fight when we see each other. And she hasn't called me so far. Fine. Who needs a home? When she dies, just go to her funeral and take the condolatory money. And her insurance money, too... Fuck. How can you say that? - Taek-il, baby. - What? Is he okay? Just keep eating. Stop hitting me. Do you know why I'm still here? To kill a pig, you bastard! I must have missed a bit. Geo-seok? Stay back. Just sit down. Don't come to me. Don't shake your hand. Don't come close! Wait. Come here. Come back. Shit. That bastard. We have other places to go today. Stay back! Get back down. Do you want to be a cripple over that little money? He won't jump. Hey, what are you going to do? Are you going to jump? Damn it. This is all I have. If you let me off this time, I'll win the money and pay it off. Give me just one more day. Please. Listen. We're not trying to threaten you. We came because you pulled some shit and you kept your phone off. I'll collect the rest at the end of this month. Don't ruin your life gambling. Get a real job.

I work at a Chinese restaurant in Gunsan. I eat and sleep there too. My boss is really nice, unlike somebody. So don't worry. I'm doing fine. I came to say that. How can you not come back just because I told you to? Since when did you listen to what I say? Do you even think of me as your mom? That's why I came to tell you I'm doing fine. Just come home. And keep studying. I don't want to. Don't force me to study. When you become an adult, you have to work even if you don't want to. I'll support you until then. Take the equivalency test and go to college. What's so good about college? I won't do anything bad. Can't I just live my life? Can't you just believe in me? You can't just do what you want to do. People are not going to treat you well. What's wrong with doing what I want? Do what you want too, Mom. Why the heck did you start this business anyway? This is what I want to do now. So come home. I'll support you until college. I don't need it. I'm fine on my own. It's way better than living with you. Mom. Do what you want. Don't give up your life because of me. And stop worrying about me. I'm leaving. GO TAEK-IL TAEK-IL TOASTS I'm back, sir. Did you speak with your mother? Yes. But please don't talk about my mom again. Welcome. This used to be a pancake shop. You're the new owner? Yes. It hasn't been long. What would you like? I'd like the most popular one, please. Coming right away. You even have plants? It's nicely decorated. But didn't you hear from the former owner? This is a temporary building. Without my care, it'll be torn down. I didn't hear anything. Who are you? Drink it. You're going to do this alone this time. "Alone"? Did you think you could follow me forever and get paid for nothing? Of course not. What if he doesn't take me seriously? Then make him take you seriously. Watch me. Use this part between the eyebrows. Frown upon him to look intimidating. Good. That's why I look much older than I am. Make the look. Got it? Don't be scared. Be confident. No mercy. No mercy. What can I get you? I came to collect the money. I'm from the Global Financial. Shit. Global... Why are you here? I'm done paying. That's only the interest. You still owe half the money. I didn't come to threaten you. Damn bastards. The interest is more than the borrowed amount. How much more do you want? You son of a bitch. I'm not paying a penny. So go. Leave. Here? Almost nine million won. He'll be fine on his own. We'll get it all. How about eating some barbecue? Shit. What happened? Hey. Sang-pil! Look at me. Are you okay? You son of a bitch! It's okay.

No matter how hard I think about it, I have no idea why I got beaten up. I didn't do anything wrong. I just went there to collect the money he borrowed. I didn't even hit him first. Why did he hit me? It hurts like crazy. Just wrap it twice. It won't spill. Don't go overboard. They wanted extra pickled radish. - Here's your food. - Thanks. - Who ordered jjamppong? - Over there. Gyeong-ju. You can use the room at the back. It's okay, sir. You can't keep sleeping at a sauna. Why does she get her own room? I want it. His snoring drives me nuts. It used to be my daughter's room. So you should use it. You have a daughter, sir? How come I've never seen her? How old is she? Why doesn't she ever come by? Shut up. Stop yapping and just eat. What? Stop picking on me. I'd better get some rest. Goodnight, everyone. Anyway, let's finish off the welcome dinner for our newest member at the karaoke bar after we finish eating. Seriously? KARAOKE BAR Do you want to get some ice cream? How could you ask for free minutes three times? - I wanted to sing many songs. - You only sang Twice's songs. T.T Pull it. Do it gently. Don't break it.

It's not. What are you looking at? You stupid retard. I knew you'd get hurt doing that shit. Do what suits you. Don't pretend you're something big. This fucking sucks.

You'll leave your grandmother and do what? Goodness. Just do what suits you. Then what suits me? Why do you keep saying that? Are you saying that living in a shit hole with my grandmother suits me? You know what suits you and what doesn’t. Why are you so mad? Do it if you can, then. Fine. Wait. Sang-pil. What's with him? Stop peeling the chestnuts. I told you I'll make money.

It's better to die than to live like this. Stab me. You want me to stab you? - Go on. - What? You think I can't do it? Kill me, you son of a bitch! You don't think I can do it, do you? Where's the pig? This is a Chinese restaurant. Fuck. Don't fool me. - Come out. - Boss. You bastards. All the bastards we want are here. You crazy bastards! - Get out. You crazy assholes. - Hey.

Let's see how many can fit in your mouth. If you spit them out, you're dead. Hold still, bastard. Bro. Hey. Open wide. Don't move, asshole. Let's see if your teeth break first or the lighters. Geo-seok. Son of a bitch. Geo-seok. Behind you! Die, you son of a bitch. You're really Lee Geo-seok? Lee Geo-seok that we all know? Chief. Those bastards are wanted for sex trafficking with minors.

What do you mean, make money like this? You bastard. Dong-hwa. What did you teach him? Damn. What a fucking retard. Don't be sorry. Just go back and get the money. If you can't, then watch us do it and learn. You don't want to break our trust in you, do you? Damn it. Do you think I do this because I fucking like it? I get scared, too. I didn't force you. You came to me because you needed money. Then just do it. If you keep doing it, it'll become a job that suits you. Stop complaining, you idiot. JANGPUNG CHINESE RESTAURANT You've stayed here since then? And you grew your hair, too? Hey, kid. Wait here for a bit. People don't change easily. Everyone already knows what you've done to those bastards last night. Let's not talk about that. Guys in Dongdaemun and Cheongnyangni are joining their forces. To get to us. Please step up before that happens. Or it'll be really hard for our boys. Go. We have to open the restaurant soon. How long do you think you can stay here? When they find out, they'll come straight for you. Is it okay for this place to be sacked? I'll leave the car. Come when you're ready. Let's live as we're meant to. Do what suits you. JAJANGMYEON 3,000 WON FOR EATING IN Kid. When adults talk, it's polite to make yourself scarce. It's just you and my bro seemed very close. Sorry, sir. "Your bro"? He got so soft. You're really going because he told you to? It's not like you, bro. This is who I really am. I have no choice. Geo-seok. - What's this? - It's nothing much. Just be careful. Come back whenever you want. Thank you, sir. Take care. Stop crying, Gu-man. Give me that bag. I'm not going to die. Keep practicing the wok work, okay? Forget your parents who abandoned you. And stop losing your coins. Bro? Can't you just stay? Who are you going to beat up in Seoul? Who's going to cook? How can he be so cold? Where are you going? To get some air. - Why? - Can I come, too? Do you really have nowhere to go? What about your parents? No. What about you? I have my mom. I see. I envy you. That would be 5,000 won, please. Thank you. DEMOLISH ILLEGAL VENDORS TO BE DEMOLISHED What? It's tomorrow. Shit. What? Did you know your mom's store is being torn down tomorrow? What? Why is it being torn down? I get that you two don't talk often. Shouldn't you at least know what's happening to your mom? Her shop is marked off in red as an illegal vendor. Fuck. Why are they doing that? I don't know. Call her now. Is something wrong? Damn it. Boss. TAEK-IL The person you are calling can't be reached... A lot of things need to be fixed here. I'll just renovate the whole restaurant. If you have something to do, use this time. Let's take a week off. Thank you, sir. BOSS COME TO THE BUTCHER SHOP TOMORROW YOU NEED TO MAKE MONEY How did you know? Why is it being torn down? Why didn't you take my calls? Is she your girlfriend? Just tell me what happened. Do you play any sports? You have sharp eyes. I'll make you a toast. It's about to be demolished. Let's get out of here. I'll take care of my business. Just go somewhere else with her. You'll take care of it? You meddle with everything I do. But you'll take care of yourself? What? So you just hit me and meddle with my life and that's it? Why can't you tell me when you need help? Why didn't you tell me about this? Is it because I'm a loser? Is that so? Tell me. Can't you trust me? Gosh, I'm so sorry. Taek-il is usually not like this. Milk? - Thank you. - Go on. Fine. I don't care even if it gets demolished. Do whatever you want. Shit. She's making me so mad. What is she going to do? Damn it. Let's report it to the cops. It's an illegal stand. Just go. You'll get hurt if you stay here. Gosh, this is driving me nuts. BUTCHER SHOP Dong-hwa. Stab him. Me? Do it. It's your job. There must be another way. What other way? Dong-hwa? Snap to it. We're doing this shit all because of you, right? Yes. Look at me. Seong-mu. Grab his hand. Take it. - Let go, bastards. - Seong-mu. Stab him. Go on. You son of a bitch! Pay up your debt, asshole! Just give us the money. Give it to us. That was nice and easy. I knew that bastard had money. He just didn't pay up. Who hides money up his ass? Dong-hwa. Since it's been a while, our timing was a bit off, right? Are you okay? Yes. - Hey, you. - Yes? - What's wrong? - Nothing, sir. Why do you look so down? We taught him a lesson for cracking your head. Stand tall. Where are we going next? A shop in my turf is a week overdue. Her shop will be demolished today. So let's go there first. Hop in. I'll finish up here and meet you there later. Let's do something about it. I'll help you. You helped me when you can't even fight. Taek-il, baby. What's up? Bro? Are you in Seoul now? Yes. Why? I'm so sorry, but can you do me a favor? What is it? My mom's store is about to be torn down. When? I think they'll start soon. Could you come here quickly? You know what I do, right? You're our chef. We're co-workers. Help me out. I have to take a dump. Come here and wipe my ass? Why would I wipe your ass? I'm not joking here. You're supposed to wipe your own ass, right? I don't have time. So you act like a grown-up when you want, and you cry like a baby when things go sour? You said you're not a kid. Then protect what's important to you and fight like a man. Then, what about you? You just know how to beat people up but you hide when we actually need you. You just run away. Have you ever stepped up when you really had to? Damn kid. - It's been long, boys. - Yes, boss. Damn it. I thought you retired. So you're still kicking? Did you come alone? Your business must be going well to eat out at a place like this. Are you going to fight alone like in the past? Isn't he a bit too old for that? I'm busy. So I'll be brief. Listen up. Don't go around together and cause trouble. Just keep your own turfs and live peacefully. Got that? It's simple, right? It's complicated. Did you see our boys outside? Our clan is now bigger so it's hard to feed them all. Here. Eat this, then. I'm done talking. Why? Do you want me to sing? Do you like Twice? - What's with you? - Wait. Not here. - Stop, please. - Hi, ma'am. Ma'am. - Hello. - Shit. Not this place. - Sang-pil? - Hi. - It's today. - Stop. - Not this place, please! - Move. Don't hurt him! Hey, are you nuts? Ma'am? - What is it? - Last time... Are you okay? Why did you hit him? I didn't. If you came to demolish this place, just do it and leave. - Hey. Stop it. - You bastard. We didn't come for that. We're from the Global Financial. Why am I explaining to you? Ma'am? Where's the money? You borrowed money for this? I said I'll take care of my business. - You can't. Hey. - Why did you bring your friends? Look at me. What the hell? - It wasn't me. - What is all this? You fucking asshole. - I didn't know. - How could you not know? Fuck you. You made my mom borrow money from the loan shark? I didn't borrow it from Sang-pil. But he's their henchman! He's one of them. Hey! - I'm not. - Come here, you bastard. Let go of me. Shit. - I swear I didn't know. - You fucker. - Come here. - Please, just go! I'll get my house deposit and pay you back. So just go. What deposit? Then where would we live? - Boss. - You come here, bastard. I found some money. Why did you pretend like you don't have any? - Come here, bastard. - Shit. Give me that. GO TAEK-IL What are you going to do now? Why didn't you pay your interest? You're a bad debtor. - Get back! - Get back! Boss. You bastard. Stop it. Please stop. DEMOLISH Give it. Give it back! We're taking what's ours. Son of a bitch. Get off him! - Let go. - You bastard. Fucking bastard. What a pain in the ass. You asshole. Bastard. Let go. You shit. Hey. Give it back, please. I'll work and pay it off. So give it back. Because I'm a retard, my mom borrowed money from you. So I'll pay it back, shitheads. How will you do that? That's my mom's money. I gave it to her. Give it back. - Whatever. - I gave that to Mom. - This isn't your mom's, but mine. - Please. I'll pay it back. - It's mine. - I'll pay it all back. Let go. Bastard. I can pay you back. Give it. I gave that to my mom. Let go, you bastard. Shit. Taek-il, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Aren't you coming with us? Go to the bank and make a deposit. Oh, my gosh. GO TAEK-IL Why didn't you just leave? I told you I'd pay you back. Sir. Why did you come here alone? Are you okay? Stop the car. Why are we here? Let's go to Sang-hwan's. You can't come in here, sir. Can I borrow your wok, please? Don't push and pull so hard. It's all in the wrist. My boss never gives lectures, so I didn't know that. What are you doing, sir? I made that. This is what I do now. Eat up. Try it. You like jajangmyeon. TAEK-IL TOASTS Hey. To your right. That's it. TOAST Throw out what you don't need. We can't take everything anyway. I can't throw this out. I can see well with these. You're glowing. Aren't you even mad? You got conned and lost everything. Even our house. It's okay because you're back. This is hard. How have you been doing this? - Isn't he funny? - Yes. I'm hungry. Where's my food? We ordered the fried chicken you wanted. It'll come soon. Who are you? I'm Taek-il's mom. We moved here a while ago. It's Yun Jeong-hye. That's my mom's name. - Jeong-hye. - Yes. That's a pretty name for a pretty lady. You look like Gyeong-sun. What? What about me? Who am I? You're a tiger. Why can't you remember my name? Do you really not know it? You're a tiger, the king of the jungle. The chicken is here. Ma'am. Your chicken is here. Your chicken is here. One fried chicken and one seasoned. That'd be 24,000 won... Dong-hwa. Hi. I quit that job and started a fried chicken business. I'm the CEO. It's hard to find part-timers these days. So I cook and deliver. Sang-pil. Take this. - Wait. - I insist. Take the money. It's because I burned it slightly. Just eat it. You'll have to pay next time though. JANGPUNG CHINESE RESTAURANT WE ARE OPEN Snap. Use your wrist. Good. I'm back. SO GYEONG-JU Hop on. Where are we going? Well, I don't know. Wherever you want to go, Mom. We should set a destination. Just hop on. There. Let's just go. Something's bound to turn up. Ready?
