EDITED by HAMID-JOON [Martial Universe] [Episode 41] Centuries ago, the Emblem Ancestor opened the gate to the alternate realm in the process of cultivating his Spirit Power. The Yimo from the other side took the opportunity to enter the mortal realm. They accumulated their powers and caused mass destruction. The Emblem Ancestor and his eight disciples engaged in battle against them. They formed the eight Ancestral Emblems through the laws of heaven and earth. For centuries afterwards, people called Emblem Masters kept track of the Yimo. They also made it their duty to find the scattered Ancestral Emblems to prevent the Yimo from causing another catastrophe. The time has come at last. The Ancestral Emblem is here! It's appeared at last! I'm weak. I can't win this match. - This is all I can do. - Father! Stop! Don't! Lin Lang Tian, did you know all along the Yimo was in the Lei Family? Was everything that happened afterwards part of his plans? I will answer your question if you make it out of Qingyang Town. Just you wait. You know that my cultivation is weak. I really can't handle such huge responsibility. The Emblem Ancestor left his will behind with us a long time ago. The moment the Yimo returned, all of us Emblem Masters must return. You could call this is our faith. I can try out this Guild Master thing if you promise me three conditions. Go on. One: You must cure my sister Qing Tan of her poison. Rest assured! Two: I want to learn all of the Emblem Master Guild's martial arts so no one can belittle me. That's a given! In the future, you have to listen to me no matter what. Don't oppress me with the rules. Even if it's the Emblem Ancestor's rules. As long as it doesn't veer from the ultimate goal of killing Yimo your word is my command. The Emblem Master Tower is condensed by all the previous Guild Masters. It is reformed every year. At the apex of the tower lies the highest symbol of an Emblem Master. The Ancestral Stone. The difficulty of the tower battle increases with each layer. It's a dangerous journey and no one has ever reached the top. The massacre has begun. All you people care about is winning or losing! Do any of you care about Lin Dong's life? He can only survive if you believe in him! Neither of our groups has obtained it in all these years. So I've come to an agreement with the Ghost Puppet Sect. If we win this time, they'll join us in our battle against the Yimo. If we lose, we'll merge with them and the Emblem Master Guild disappears. How could you just give the Nirvana Heart away? Do you realize that leveling in cultivation could take five to ten years? The tower battle is in a few days. How can you do it without the Nirvana Heart? - Are there no other ideas? - No! If you think being the successor is a joke then there's no need for you to be Guild Master! I'm afraid I can't protect you any more. Our path ends here. Take it! Just so you know... it's useless even if you have the mirror! The only thing it reflects is you and me! This thunder is extremely harrowing. My Yuan pill is inside you. I'll call on the thunder to temper your body to open at least 24 of your meridians. I hope you can withstand the thunder's tribulations. You're so lucky. He's so stubborn, yet he practically went down his knees for you. But you don't care at all! What is the use of emotions when the Yimo haven't been dealt with? You're cruel. If someone did all that for me, I would be so happy. Lin Dong! Lin Dong! - Give a shout if you're alive! - If the Guild Master doesn't come out the tower must not fall. Keep holding on! I'm the savage girl! That's what you call me, right? From the moment the Yimo reappeared... no one in this world, including you and me, could escape this calamity. No one was able to surpass the Emblem Ancestor. The Ice Master was the only one who had a chance. Which one of your words were true? Is that so important? Have you been lying to me this whole time? Between your brother and me, you can only help one of us. No, don't! Your cultivation is still too immature. The Ice Ancestral Emblem is supremely powerful. Demanding it to acknowledge you as master is life-threatening. It will mess up your cultivation. It will also suck your life from you. If I use all of my powers, I can give you... three days. I'll be Ying Huan Huan for three more days. A lively, vivacious three days... to make up for centuries of isolation! - We're married! - I got to see... the way she looked in that wedding dress. It was worth it. One last thing. Be happy with Junior Ying. The Dao Sect was weak and unstable. You don't have to feel remorse for choosing a small sacrifice over a large one. Elder... you've been avenged. You don't have to worry that I'm being rash. I've already thought things through regarding Lin Dong. I will wait for him. And he will wait for me. I'd understand if you said you liked me. Go away! What is meant to be yours will always be yours. What isn't meant to be yours will never be yours. What's yours is yours, and what's not is not. Whatever! It's... Senior Su. And Qing Zhu. You... I can't see you guys, but I can hear you. Junior Lin, I remember once you and Qing Zhu were inseparable. I'm sure you have lots to catch up on. I'll take my leave then. Does it ever hurt? I'm fine. I may be blind, but I can hear better now. I feel much more clarity in my heart as well. The Guild Master is consoling me. Don't call me that anymore. Just call me by my name. Have you seen her yet? Senior Ling... let's discuss serious matters. You've also changed the way you address me. Never mind. Call me whatever you want. I just got used to the foolish things you used to call me. But whenever a huge change occurs, everything else changes as well. - Qing Zhu... - Don't we have things to discuss? Since Zhou Tong isn't the one who released the Third Seat King... it must be a spy hidden amongst the Dao Sect. I'm afraid of the possibility that all the sects have Yimo spies. Do you suspect anyone? It's hard to say. Your Majesty... - Third Seat King... - And what of it? You and Six are still here. - Are you admitting defeat? - Humans are full of tricks. We've already lost two kings in a row. We don't even know where the Fifth Seat King is. - Your Majesty, why don't we-- - Why don't we what? Why don't I accumulate more energy for you - so you can escape? - And then what? - And then we get out of here! - Get out of here? Are you even capable of leaving your junior? Shut your mouth! Lin Dong has been studying powerful martial arts in the Dao Sect - and he got Three killed. Do you think-- - That's enough! From where we stand now, I feel we can use Lin Lang Tian. Why do I feel like ambition is the only thing he possesses? He is the only one capable of agitating Lin Dong's heart. They're brothers, which means they're destined opponents. Lin Lang Tian isn't even a match for Lin Dong right now. That's not necessarily true. Your Majesty, I have an idea. But it's extremely risky. My cover in the Yuan Gate Sect will be completely destroyed. Lang Tian, how are your injuries? I'm... still quite a ways from the Nirvana Stage. You aren't aware yet, are you? Lin Dong has already successfully cultivated the Great Desolate Scripture of Dao Sect. He also killed the Third Seat King. His powers are increasing exponentially. I'm afraid that your status within the Lin Family will be surpassed by him. You don't need to worry. I won't let you down no matter what. I understand your pain and your feelings. Let me help you. How did you do that? I would do anything for you. Rest assured. The Triple Sect Competition is in a few days. This time, I won't disappoint you. I'm sure you're all aware of the upcoming Triple Sect Competition. The competition will commence within an ancient trove. The rules are the same as always. Whoever deciphers the ancient trove's riddles will gain its best weapons and will become the champion among the three sects. An ancient trove? I've never heard of this place. I only heard just now. They say it's quite old. The interior is like a maze, with many secret arts and treasures hidden inside. I suppose such a place is nothing to write home about. In order to motivate all disciples in the battle against the Yimo... the three sects have decided to increase the difficulty of the competition. Contestants will explore the Burning Sky Tomb for the very first time. It's a responsibility, but also a challenge. It's a challenge, but also an honor. Demolishing the Yimo is all of your responsibility but you can only achieve the honor of such responsibility through a challenge. I hope that you all put in your best effort and fight for the honor! We shall kill the Yimo and bear our responsibility! We shall work hard and fight for the honor! We shall kill the Yimo and bear our responsibility! We shall work hard and fight for the honor! The Sect Master is approaching. - Lin Dong. - Master. I treated Senior Lin earlier and found his injuries have improved. In addition, he's been training hard and can get around like any other person now. Lin Dong. No one has been able to kill the Third Seat King since our sect's establishment. Thus I've decided to circumvent the rules and allow you to join the competition. You will be allowed to enter the Burning Sky Tomb. Thank you, Master. All I want to do is focus on training right now. You should give this opportunity to a more qualified disciple. Senior Lin! Lin Dong, I have a piece of advice for you. Whether or not you participate in the competition... be sure not to peek at the map of the ancient trove in the Great Hall. Even if I wanted to... I wouldn't be able to see it. Lin Dong! Do you know how rare it is for a new disciple to be given such a chance? Even if so, it's just a competition over a title. I can kill Yimo even without becoming the champion. You don't care, but Sect Master Ying does. Last year, it was the Purity Palace's Senior Ling who won. And the two years before that, the Yuan Gate Sect won. We've lost three years in a row! Lin Dong, you should go! Aren't there still the rest of you? It should be our turn to win this year. You don't care about the title but don't you want the chance to get into the Sky Hall to meet Junior Ying? Getting into Sky Hall is no longer of importance to me. You-- There's a step here. Here. If you want to look at the map, that's your business. Why did you bring me along? Don't you think Master was purposely leading you here? Besides, he was just giving you friendly advice. - We can't let him down, right? - I understand his good intentions. But as I said... Even if I wanted to look at it, I can't. Senior Lin, I found it! I found the map! Here it is. This map is so bizarre. I think... it's moving. The symbols and routes on this map are constantly changing. I thought you couldn't see? How did you know? - Surprisingly, this is a spirit map. - A spirit map? Why has the Master never brought up something so important? Only Emblem Masters can decipher this map. To others, it just appears to be a regular map. The power emanating from this place isn't normal. Everyone be cautious. Stop acting so paranoid. - You lot go in and scope things out. - Yes. Get back here! All Mu Qian Qian does is put on airs and leave the dirty work to us! The enchantment surrounding this place is out of ordinary. All disciples above the Yuan Dan Stage, use your Yuan Power as defense - and enter the tomb with me! - Yes! Everyone else, turn back! - Careful, there's a step. - Watch out! Come. - Watch out! - What did you bring me here for? I just advanced to Earth Hall. Earth Hall's hall master is nothing like Wu Dao. - I have to go back to my training. - Don't, Junior! Come, come, over here. - Sit, sit! - Have a seat! Junior! - We're here to change your mind. - Yes, you must join the competition! The Fierce Sky Halberd is found in the Burning Sky Tomb! That's a treasure that even the best of the best can't obtain! Don't you know you're the one that stands the best chance at getting it? Even if you don't care for the treasures the fires in the tomb are good for your eyes. Enough already! Lin Dong, don't listen to them. Who was it that begged me to get him into Sky Hall? - Who wanted to see Junior Ying? - Senior... aren't you going overboard? He already said he doesn't care about entering Sky Hall anymore. - What is even going on here? - Sky Hall isn't the only way to see her. Besides, shouldn't we be anticipating the day Huan Huan becomes Ice Master? Senior, you keep trying to get the two of them to meet. You resemble an impatient matchmaker. Is-- Is that strange? I'm a romantic at heart! I don't like seeing Junior Ying hurt. - I've never considered you the type. - What did you just say? All right. Am I allowed to speak now? You don't have to, we know you don't want to go, so never mind. - But-- - What are you doing? Junior, go ahead. I have a feeling that this Burning Sky Tomb is particularly dangerous. I'm up for the challenge. I'm willing to fight for some glory for us all. That's great! Wonderful, you've finally come to your senses! All right, I'm going to let Master know! He really is quite sentimental. Heaven Seat King, Lin Dong told me himself that he'll join the competition. It seems you weren't able to stop him. But the strange thing is he was so adamant about not participating. He changed his mind after seeing the ancient trove's map. Something is going on here. Whatever it is, I will find out. You just keep an eye on Lin Dong and Ying Huan Huan. If she ends up mastering the Ice Master's skills... things won't bode so well for you. Careful. You can't easily enter this place. I investigated a map of this trove. There's an enchantment at the entrance to the Burning Sky Tomb. Disciples below the Yuan Dan Stage cannot enter. Yuan Gate's disciples have already tried. This place is incredibly dangerous. Your eyes-- It's fine. I've gotten used to it. Come here. I happened across this hairpin earlier. I might not be able to see, but I believe it suits you. I can't see, but I'm still able to place this pin in your hair. Lin Dong, when Qing Zhu was fulfilling her duty as your protector... she nearly lost her life while guarding you throughout your journey. I really don't think a hairpin is going to make up for all that. Lin Dong. It's dangerous in there. Why don't you let your Emblem Protector be your eyes? I can smell him even before he arrives. Come on out, Little Marten. How can you leave me out of this! Next time give a warning if you're going to throw a tantrum! Where's Xiao Yan? Why isn't he here? You really think the two of us do nothing but laze around all day? I had him go around the sects to see if there are any traces of Yimo. Great! As expected of the Thunderbolt Emblem's master. Everyone is present. Let's set off. Fellow disciples, stop drooling over these subpar treasures. Don't waste our time. Don't stress. The trove's illusions aren't easy to face. Lin Dong and company are still stuck back there. I don't see them entering anytime soon. There are so many treasures here. Just let everyone have their fill. Relax. Let's go! Come on! Senior, I can't get this out! Move it. Useless. You can't even manage this? Spirit treasures all have souls. If you want to retrieve them for your own use you have to use your Yuan Power. Of course, me just using brute force like this is useless. Ling Zhen. The masters say that our target this year is the Fierce Sky Halberd. That's right! Our target is the Fierce Sky Halberd. The Fierce Sky Halberd. That also happens to be the Dao Sect's goal. And the Nine Heavens Purity Palace's. All right. Since it's a competition, we'll settle things with martial arts. I haven't been in the Dao Sect for long so I'm quite ignorant. I was hoping to get some advice from my Yuan Gate seniors. Lin Dong... are you sure this is the place? Are we supposed to jump into the lava to get the halberd? It should be here. Are you talking about the location of the Fierce Sky Halberd? No. I'm talking... about the Chaos Ancestral Emblem. Chaos Ancestral Emblem? The map of this place is actually a spirit map. The Chaos Ancestral Emblem is right underneath the Fierce Sky Halberd. So... this is the reason you decided to join the competition? Over there. Careful! I think the halberd is down there! Stop, stop! Stop! Stop fighting already! All of our sects are on the same side. We're allies, let's not ruin our camaraderie. Calm down. Stop fighting! - Get over here! - Stop fighting! Ling Zhen, getting the Fierce Sky Halberd is priority. Let's go. Get back here! Get back here! It can't be a coincidence the Fierce Sky Halberd and Chaos Emblem are together. It's deliberate? You have to obtain the Fierce Sky Halberd before obtaining the Chaos Emblem. What are these things? I think you woke the soul of the halberd. Hurry and get the Emblem before all the demons wake up! It's coming out! Lin Dong. Straight ahead. Lin Dong! Lin Dong! This way. - What are you doing here? - Get our disciples out of here. What gives you the right to appear out of nowhere to order us around? If you don't believe me, don't blame me when you die later. What do you mean? I saw a demon swarm on my way here. A demon swarm? Then we-- we have to hurry and warn Junior Ling and the rest! What kind of time is this? You're still going on about her. - The Palace disciples aren't idiots. - But a demon swarm will-- Let's get out of here! Fools. Check this out! This is so pretty! Why do you keep staring at me instead of looking for treasures? Is there something on my face? Senior, you have such great skin. I heard the Purity Palace has a kind of mud that regenerates the skin. - Let's go. - It seems it's as good as advertised. - You must mean the imperial mud. - Yes, that's it. That mud is so effective, it must be very valuable. Would you mind giving me some to try? Tong Chuan! Tong Chuan, are you trying to get Yang Yuan pills? Senior! Senior! Senior, all the Yuan Gate disciples disappeared! - Did they suddenly decide to leave? - But why? - Are they giving up the treasures? - Perhaps they discovered something? Lin Lang Tian! You keep making the wrong choices! You should have expected this day would come when you let me go. I won't waste any time with you. All I want are the Ancestral Emblems. Both the Absorption and Chaos Emblems. How do you know about the Chaos Emblem? You've made a mistake. The Emblem isn't in my hands. You must have a way to obtain it. Hand it over, and I'll return Ling Qing Zhu to you. Lin Dong! My life isn't worth as much as the Emblem. Don't be rash! Great Sect disciples... martial arts heroes? You can all die. Lin Dong! Lin Dong! Don't tell me you're toast. Lin Lang Tian, I can't possibly give the Emblem to you. If you want to take a life... come kill me. Lin Dong! How long are you going to play the hero? You're only where you are today because I helped you along! Without me, you are nothing! Do you think you can achieve success simply by stopping me? That's right! You started your journey of killing Yimo before me. But the only reason you kill Yimo is for your own benefit. Everything you do is for yourself. If your heart never strayed, why would I get in your way? If you cared about the welfare of the world, why would you care about success? Don't you understand? We can only find the Yimo Emperor with the Sixth Seat King! I know you have great aspirations. You don't want to succumb to anyone. Lin Dong! I'll leave you for the demon swarm to deal with. Lin Lang Tian! Lin Lang Tian! Lin Lang Tian! Lin Lang Tian! Lin Lang Tian! Yes, I am nothing! But what about you? What are you? Everything you do is for your own sake! What about me? I'm trying to protect my loved ones! I'm trying to protect everyone. Rest assured. I'm the only one who would ever dare bully her. My home is wherever you are. Subtitles by DramaFever I agreed to work with you, but not for you to injure my disciples! Jiang Hao. Mo Ling. They're all dead. The other disciples are being treated. Lin Lang Tian! This is what you call killing Yimo? Junior, wait for me. I won't let you become Ice Master. [Martial Universe]
