(orchestral music) (soft orchestral music) (seagulls squawking) (baby weeping loudly) - [Felix] Settle down, June! Take it easy! - Yeah, take it easy. Take it easy. What kind of idiot do you think I am, Felix? Did you really think I wouldn't figure things out?! - It's okay. I can't believe I had to pull you kicking and screaming out of our front yard with Derek on your hip! - (scoffs) You would wanna protect her. - I never cheated on you! - Before her, right?! - That's right! Years of jealousy, rages and accusations. You never trusted me. Don't like you're not part of the problem. - Please. Me and your son mean nothing to you. (baby weeping loudly) - That's not true. You need help, June. It's been bad for a long time. I never know when you're gonna lose it. - Oh yeah? You can't live with me? Well guess what? You don't have to. (tires screeching) 'Cause I'd rather die than let you live with her! Stop, you're... (tires screeching) You're scaring Derek. - Whore! - You stop, Felix! Stop! - No, you stop! - I hate you! (tires screeching) (intense orchestral music) I hate you! - June, look out! (tires screeching) (cars smashing) (foreboding orchestral music) (baby weeping loudly) (energetic funk music) - [Megan] I'm so glad we're here. I needed to get away. - To a girl's weekend. (chuckles) (glasses clinking) - Cheers. - More specifically to Kathy or should I say Principal Sullivan. - I just hope I don't screw it up. - What are you talking about? You've got this. You were voted best teacher three times and now you'll make even a better principal. - It is a dream come true. Megan, Stacey, I don't know if I could've made it through the past year without you two in my corner. - We're gonna always be here for you whenever you need us. - God, I hope they come and fix the a/c. - It's been about an hour. Lemme call them again. - Good idea. (soft jazz music) - [Ian] Hey there. - Are you new? Where's Clint tonight? I already called him twice about room 302. - Yeah, I'm new and I'm filling in for him. Sorry, I'm still getting used to this thing. I didn't catch you the first time, I'm Ian. - Well Ian, I hope you're good with a/cs. - Don't worry, I got you covered. (radio beeping) - A little more? - Little more, you know me. C'mon. (chuckles) - Now let's talk about your man situation or the lack of one. - Don't even go there. Between work and my separation with Ben, it's the furthest thing from my mind. - I'm sure Ben's not wasting time on the dating apps. I'm sorry, that came out wrong. You know me and wine. - We both agreed we just need a little time apart. He can do whatever he wants. - Still it wouldn't hurt to have a little fun. (door knocking) - (scoffs) Finally. Starting to sweat. - Come on in. - Hi, you guys called about the a/c? - Oh yes, we can't seem to get it to come on. - Lemme see. (soft intriguing music) - Do you think you can turn it on for us? - What? - Sometimes you just have to... (a/c beeping) There you go. System just needed to be reset. - No problem. When I need my system reset, I'll know just to call. - Is there anything else I can do for you lovely ladies? - Well, I could think of a couple things. - No, we're good. Thank you. We appreciate your help. - Just call the front desk if you guys need anything and ask for Ian. - Thank you. - Thank you, Ian. - I'll let you guys get back to it. - I wouldn't mind spending a few hours under that. (Kathy scoffing) Oh and men that age are always tryin' to prove how good they are in bed. - It sounds like you have some first-hand experience. - Maybe, maybe not. - He's just a college kid. This is probably his summer job. - We should leave him a fat tip. - Megan. (chuckles softly) (soft intriguing music) Okay, you two. I'm gonna call it. I'm gonna have a quick hot tub before I crawl into bed. What about her? - Let her sleep it off. Meet me for breakfast? - Sounds like a plan. Thank you again for setting this up. - No problem, hun. But really think about this man thing; maybe it's time for you to step your little toe back into the swimming pool of romance. - We'll see. Goodnight. - Goodnight. (water splashing lightly) (soft jazz music) - Hi there. (Kathy gasping) Sorry, didn't mean to scare you. - It's okay. I was just deep into my thoughts. - Do you mind? - Not at all. - Hotel lets us use the amenities after our shift. - I was just enjoying the night before heading up to bed. - I don't think I caught your name. I'm Ian. - I remember. I'm Kathy. - It's nice to meet you, Kathy. Sure you don't wanna join me? - No I'm good, thanks. - Water feels pretty great. (soft foreboding music) - Ian? Ian. Ian. Come on, quit playin' around. (Ian chuckling) Are you okay? - What was that about? - I'm sorry, I saw you. You weren't moving and I got worried. - Oh no no, I'm sorry. I like to float underwater. It helps me to relax. - You were down there and not moving. I just feel so silly. - I'm sorry. - I was a lifeguard in college. - I'm sorry. - A natural reaction, I guess. - I'm sorry, I didn't mean to scare you like that. I have to admit, that was pretty sexy the way you jumped in. - Not what I was going for, but thank you all the same. Well, I better get up to my room. It's pretty late. - It's not that late. Lemme walk you back up to your room. It's the least I can do for when you tried to save my life. - Well I mean, I don't normally. - What? (both chuckling softly) Come on, we're just two adults. I think you're pretty hot. - Okay. - Look, we can just hang out. Maybe grab a drink from the minibar. It's on me. - Maybe just one drink. I feel a little silly inviting you back to my room. I'm old enough to-- - There's nothing old about you. You are smart and beautiful. I could tell from the moment I saw you. - Look, I'm still technically married. - What does technically mean? - Well we're separated, but I'm hoping that we work things out. - That's great. I hope that happens. But tonight, it's just you and me. (foreboding orchestral music) - This just isn't me. - Look you're not hurting anyone, are you? It feels good. We're just two adults that are attracted to each other and whatever happens stays between us. (lips smacking) (foreboding sensual music) (waves whooshing) (seagulls squawking) (romantic piano music) - And my apologies for your a/c problems last night. - Please, thank the maintenance guy. Ian, I believe? - I'm sorry, I don't know that name. - Ian, I think he's new. - Well I'm happy we were able to assist. You ladies have a good day. - Thank you. - All right. - Last night after I woke up and went back to my room, I could've sworn I saw that Ian guy coming outta the room next to mine. - Wasn't that your room? - My room's next to your room, but-- - Oh no you didn't. - Kathy. - Wait, you guys don't know the whole story. - Don't worry, we will. - Such a naughty girl. (seagulls squawking) (soft foreboding music) - Got it? - Yeah, Clint. - What? I did everything you wanted me to. - You can have that back. Remember to keep your mouth shut. - I don't even know you. Don't worry. It's that good stuff? Got this from your dad? - Stepdad. - All this for some chick. She must be special. - Yeah, you could say that. (intense orchestral music) Don't worry, I'm comin' for you. (soft orchestral music) (birds chirping) - Bree, you home? Bree. - Hey, mom. - Hi. Have you been home long? - About an hour. Dad dropped me off after speech therapy. He said he could tell a big improvement. - Well it's true. You worked really hard. - I hate saying goodbye to dad. - I know it's hard. We just need a little time apart, okay? - Somethin' different about you. How was your trip, good? - Yeah, it was great. Just had some time with the girls. (somber orchestral music) (birds chirping) (eerie orchestral music) - Short on product, boy. You wouldn't know anything about that, would you? - And you're drugged out half the time; how would you know? - Stay outta my business. - Business? Get a real job, deadbeat. - Watch your mouth! - D'you at least feed mom? - Yeah, she's fine. - You're worthless. - What'd you say, boy?! - You okay, mom? - My baby, yes. Of course I'm doing fine. - Did Boom feed you? - Yes, you always look out for me. He can be so mean. - I know but you won't have to put up with it much longer, mom. I promise. (poignant piano music) (birds chirping) - Bree. Bree, we're gonna be late. - God, mom I heard you. - The principal and her daughter can't be late on the first day. You okay? You nervous? - What if it's the same? What if they don't like the way I-- - Don't worry about it, sweetie. You're doing so much better now. Just relax and be your beautiful self. New school, new friends for both of us. 10 minutes, okay? (soft orchestral music) (intense foreboding music) - You okay, mom? - Yeah, I'm fine. - C'mon. (foreboding orchestral music) - Here she is. Here are your messages so far, Miss Sullivan. - A handful of messages before eight a.m.? - That's how you know it's the first day of a new school year. It's always so exciting. Are you ready for your first class? - I guess. - That's all right, Bree. You're gonna love it here, I promise. - Well, meet you after school. Have a good day. Sorry about that. First-day jitters. Things at her last school were complicated. Some of the girls there made it difficult for her. Gotta get to these. (muffled crosstalk) - Morning, everyone. Please take your seats so we can get started. - Have you seen the new girl? The principal's daughter, right? She's our number one new project. I am not gonna let the budget for cheer get cut the year I'm captain. - And becoming besties with the principal's daughter. - Exactly. - You're evil, Leslie. But in the best way. - Shakespeare, folks. That's the name for the semester. We're gonna study three of his plays this year. (foreboding orchestral music) Tardy the first day. - Sorry, sir. New school. I'm tryin' to find my way around. - This guy Ian, right? We've met him before. - Yeah, I think so. (soft intriguing music) - Hi, Gina. Leslie. - He must've transferred from that school, East High. We met him at Sarah's party, you remember? - Yeah, I remember. - All right, take your notebooks out please. What I want you to do is I want you to take three minutes and write down everything you already know about Mr. William Shakespeare. - Hey, what's your name? - Bree. First day here. - In the back, focus please. (school bell dinging) (soft soothing music) - [Leslie] Hi there. - You like art? - Yeah. - Yup, this is great. Anyway, I'm Leslie. This is my friend Gina and my boyfriend Steve. - Hi there. - I'm Bree. - Yeah the principal's daughter, right? - Yeah. - Cool. Yeah, we've been wanting to meet you all day. Have you thought about trying out for cheer? - (chuckles) I'm not really the cheerleader type. - What? No, you're totally cute and athletic-looking. We're always looking for girls in shape to tryout. Some of them just don't know when to skip the French fries at lunch, you know? - [Gina] Tryouts will be next week. - We're always looking for awesome new girls to join our squad and for hanging out. What're you doing now? - I was just gonna do some homework. I'm just waiting for my mom to finish so we can go home. - Why do you speak like that? - Why don't you shut the hell up? (intense foreboding music) - Chill, dude. - I'll chill when you stop being a jackass. - Okay, calm down. - Whatever. I gotta go practice. Later, babe. - [Leslie] Sorry about him. Guys can be so clueless sometimes. - Don't worry about it. - We're gonna go get a slice of pizza next door. If you wanna join us, it's on me. - I'll have to ask my mom. - Yeah, perfect. I would love to meet her personally. Miss Sullivan. - Hi, girls. - Hi, I'm Leslie Weaver, the cheer captain. It's so great to finally meet you. - Gina Jones, the co-captain. - Nice to meet you, girls. I've heard so many good things about your squad. - Thank you, that's so sweet of you. We're so excited to have new woman principal. #Girlpower. So we have a favor to ask. - What's that? - We wanna take Bree to our favorite pizza joint just to hang out, show her around some. Please say yes. - Well, home by six? - Yeah, no problem. Promise. - 'Kay then, you girls have fun. - Yeah, perfect. Perfect. - Nice to meet you and thank you so much for showing Bree around. It's always rough being the new student. See ya later. - Your mom's sweet. Much nicer than the old principal. He always looked like he had a bad case of gas. (Bree chuckling softly) - Where did that guy go? - Ian? I don't know. He has a habit of disappearing all the time. (intense foreboding music) (lockers clanking) - I wanna make sure we have an understanding and leave that girl Bree Sullivan alone. - Why do you care? You have a thing for her or something? - Shut that mouth before I shut it permanently, you got that? (lockers clanking) (soft pop music) - Thanks. - Thanks. - Thanks. Okay, what the hell was that with Ian in the library? - I've never seen him act like that towards any girl. What's the deal? - D'you have a thing for him? I mean I get the whole bad boy thing, but give me a future CEO. - He was the one I lost it to last year at the Halloween party. - You told me you lost it to Kyle Lopez. - I lied. - Why? - I felt stupid. I thought he liked me. Turns out it was a one-night stand. (somber orchestral music) (scoffs) Seriously? - So where'd you disappear to earlier in the art room? - I got a call from my mom that I needed to answer. But I heard you guys are comin' here, hope you don't mind. - Why are you being so friendly to me? - Why wouldn't I or anybody else, for the matter of fact? - Well with the kids in my old school, it was hard. My stutter used to be pretty bad and a lot of them made my life well, hell. - Sucks. You let me know if anyone bothers you, 'kay? Us new kids have to stick together. So what's your mom as principal like? - She can be a little uptight sometimes, but I guess she's okay most of the time. My parents got separated last year though. - That's tough. - What about your parents? - They're complicated. But (mumbles) senior, I'll be outta here soon. We should hang out more, just the two of us. - Ian, what a surprise to see you again. - Yeah, I was walkin' by and saw Bree. - Uh huh. Here you go. - Thank you. - So this next weekend, Gina's parents are off in-- - Europe again. - Right, which means one thing. Party. - I'll see you then. I'm gonna go home and check on some things, but I'll see you tomorrow. - Seems like you made an impression. (Bree chuckling softly) - I don't know why. - Good question. (soft orchestral music) - Hey mom, I'm home. - I'm in the kitchen. Did you have a good time? - Yup. - Dinner just got delivered. Sorry, my day wiped me out. - I'm not that hungry. - Oh, that's right. You just went for pizza. I'm so glad to see you making friends already. - We'll see. I don't know what they want with me. - Bree, you shouldn't say things like that. I know things were difficult at your last school, but this is a fresh start for both of us. - Maybe. I did meet a cute guy, but nothing will probably come of it. - Tell me all about him. - He's pretty hot. I bet even you would think so. - Well I better keep an eye out for him then. - I'm gonna go wash up. - Okay. (cellphone buzzing) (intense foreboding music) Oh my god. (muffled crosstalk) - Hey, how's day two going? - It's okay actually. - Kid hasn't messed with you again? - No, he was in my history class and didn't even look in my direction. - Good. You let me know if that changes, okay? - Sure, thanks. - I have a feeling we have a lot in common. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. - Hey guys, sit together at lunch? I spoke to Steve. He promised to be good boy. - Actually me and Bree were gonna eat outside at the picnic tables. She's gonna help me with that English essay. - Oh okay, yeah. Next time. - Yeah, next time. (muffled crosstalk) - So I'm helping you with an essay now? - Yeah, I just wanted it to be the two of us. I wanna get to know you better. - I get a major vibe that Gina doesn't like the idea of us hanging out. Were you two a thing? - No, I mean I think she'd like to be. But some stuff happened a long time ago and yeah. - I think you're really sweet but-- - But? - I'm new here. I can't afford to make enemies already. - I'll smooth things over with Gina, 'kay? I promise. Walk you to Mr. Bono's? - Sure. - I really loved your proposal for the school literary magazine, Mr. Bono. - Thanks. I've been trying to get it goin' for years, but you know budget. - I know, we'll find the funding. - Good morning, Miss Sullivan. - Morning. (intense orchestral music) - Is everything all right, Miss Sullivan? Miss Sullivan? - Yes. Have a good class. (intense foreboding music) - Oh good, you're back. Nutritionist Mrs. Gladstone said she'd be here in a bit to go over some questions she had. Miss Sullivan, are you okay? - Yes, I'm fine. Do you happen to know a new student I just saw in Mr. Bono's class? I'm sorry. Of course, there's so many students. - Well what did they look like? - Well I saw him walking into the classroom with Bree. - Oh yes, I didn't wanna say anything. It's none of my-- - Mrs. Truman, just tell me. - Well I saw Bree walking down the hallway earlier with a certain young man, a very attractive young man. But his name is Ian Johnson. - Ian. - He's a senior, but he was a senior last year too at another school my friend works at. "Always in trouble," she said. She told me he had a meltdown in class one day and threw a chair through a window. (soft intriguing music) Friend says he's a very troubled young man. One step from juvie. He's got a file as thick as "War and Peace." - Juvie. - When he showed up here asking for a transfer from the previous principal, Mr. Parks, his parents were notably absent. It's sad, actually. Mr. Parks let him transfer once he swore he'd change. The girls are still nuts about him though. I guess it's those bad boy looks and it's true, he could charm the pants off 'em if he wanted to. Oh, I'm sorry. That wasn't the best choice of words. I would just say keep an eye on Bree. I would hate to see her getting her heart broken by the school's new Lothario. Are you sure you're okay? Can I get you anything, help you with something? - No, I'm fine. Thank you for the background information on this student. What did you say his last name was again? - Ian Johnson. - I'll be sure to keep an eye out for him. Thank you. I'll call you if I need you. - 'Course, dear. - Megan. (cellphone buzzing) - Well this is an early call. - Something horrible has happened. - It's barely nine, what could've happened already? - I made a very very bad mistake. - What kind, at work? - It's worse than you could possibly imagine. (door knocking) My next meeting is here. Just a minute. I have back-to-back meetings the rest of the day. I don't know how I'm supposed to get through this after-- - Okay, pull yourself together. - Megan, I need you to come over tonight. Ben is picking up Bree for dinner. I need you to help me figure this thing out. - Okay look, just let me know when you want me to be there. I'm sure whatever it is, we can fix it. - All I can say is that I made a big mistake at the hotel that night. - Bree, hold up. (school bell dinging) So you never told us. - How was lunch with Ian? - I helped him with Mr. Bono's essay. - Ian could care less about essays. Why do you think he's a senior again? - Maybe he wants to do better. - Yeah, maybe. We were gonna go head to the gym to get ready for cheer tryouts, wanna join? - Yeah if you wanna tryout, you should definitely get involved. - I'm just not sure it's for me. Thanks though. - Most girls would kill to get a inside edge on getting on the team. Let us know if you change your mind. You could have the key to the school if you played your cards right. We'll see you later. - Yeah. - Twin mean girls messin' with you again? - No, I'm fine. They're just-- - Just being them? - [Both] Yeah. - Assault. Assault and probation. (door knocking) Come in. - Day two and contraband found already. I mean they usually wait at least a week. - What'd you find? - This was in the bathroom. I mean you could skin a deer with this thing. I'll write a full report for ya. - Thank you, Officer Compton. Hey, do you happen to know a new student here named Ian Johnson? - (chuckles) Yeah, you're talkin' about the chair thrower from the other school. Yeah, you know I thought Principal Parks was nuts for letting him transfer here. His stepfather's a real winner too. I went to high school with him. He's practically got a good customer card at the county jail. Why? Is this kid startin' up already? - No, I just wanna know what we're dealing with. - Yeah, well keep an eye on that one. - Thank you. - So where are ya headin' now? - I was just gonna start some homework. I have at least another hour to wait for my mom. - Do you mind if I come? I mean I'd love to meet your mom. - Really? I mean most kids, except Leslie and Gina, try and dodge the new principal. - Well I mean you're pretty special, so I'm guessing your mom is too. - Okay. I have to ask, why? - Why what? (somber piano music) - I'm gonna be honest here. You're pretty hot. Guys like you pay attention to girls like Leslie and Gina, not me. - Don't sell yourself short. I don't know, I just feel like we have a connection. - If you say so. - I say so. (pen tapping) (intense foreboding music) - Mrs. Truman, I have to leave early today. - Oh sure, no problem. - Could you cover for me? I'll call you before the office closes. Thank you. - That was certainly sudden. - Oh really? - Bree? - In just about every subject. - Bree. - Mom, what's going on? - We need to leave early. - Is something wrong? - No, everything's fine. We just need to take care of something at home. - Okay. Oh by the way, this is Ian. He's in my English class. - Hi, Mrs. Sullivan. It's great to meet you. I've been getting to know Bree and you have a great daughter. - Nice to meet you, Ian. It's time to go. - Have a great night. - God, mom that was so rude. He's a nice guy. (foreboding orchestral music) He's been like the one truly nice person to me here. - I'm sorry, but we just have to go. - Where's the fire? What is wrong with you? - Bree, about Ian. I've heard something about this boy and I would prefer it if you didn't spend any time with him, okay? - What? So you want me to stay away from the one person at this school who's gone out of their way to be nice to me after everything that happened at my last school? Great, mom. - Bree, Mrs. Truman told me that-- - What? Weren't you the one who told me not to listen to gossip? - [Kathy] This isn't gossip. - What do you have against Ian? - I know this doesn't sound fair, sweetie. But you have to trust me on this. Please, just listen to me. - Whatever. (intense foreboding music) (wind chimes jingling) (dog barking) - [Ian] Hey d'you eat, ma? - I'm not that hungry. - No, remember the doctor said you have to eat at regular times to keep your strength up. - You better see if her diaper needs to be changed. I'm tired of cleanin' up after her. - Shut the hell up! (intense foreboding music) - I'm outta here. (beer splashing) (dog barking) - Hey. Look. Look, it's starting. We're gonna make her pay for what happened. I'm gonna get us outta here. It's our time. Look, I'm gonna get revenge for the both of us. I'm gonna do what dad would've done. I'm gonna save Bree. - Look, I never cheated on you! - Before her, right?! (baby weeping loudly) (somber orchestral music) (dog barking) - Bree, your dad's gonna be here soon. Bree? Don't keep your dad waiting. Bree. (intense foreboding music) (door knocking) Hi. - Hi, Kathy. - She'll be a minute, come on in. - Sure. - [Kathy] Do you want something to drink? - No, thanks. What happened to the no drinking during the week rule? - It's been a day, let's just say that. - Yeah? - Hey dad, I'll be down in a moment. - Okay. Thanks, kiddo. Are you okay? - We just had a little disagreement. - With a teenager? Imagine that. Seriously, are you okay? - I'm fine, just work stuff. Thanks for driving down here. - I told you I'm committed to being present in Bree's life no matter what it takes. - You're a good father. Sometimes, I don't know, I feel like maybe we should tell her the whole truth about why we separated, about me telling you the truth. - No. That was the past, okay? And it wasn't one thing, it never is. I think telling Bree about an affair that happened years ago is just gonna make things worse for her. We just grew apart, 'kay? And hey, I never asked you how the girls' weekend was with your friends. Was it fun? - Ready. - Okay, kiddo. How does Italian sound? - Whatever's fine. (Ben speaking foreign language) - We'll be back in a couple. (soft intriguing music) (cellphone buzzing) - Megan. - Hey, so what's up? - Yeah, please just I need you to come over right away. - [Megan] Okay okay, I'll head over. - Please hurry. - I'm on my way. (birds chirping) (soft jazz music) - So the price of admission to this fine establishment is you need to talk to me. How's the new school? - It's okay, I guess. - I know, it's rough being the new kid. I know you've had all these changes you've had to deal with. I'm really sorry about that. - It's worse with mom being totally unreasonable about some things. - Like what? - I don't wanna talk about it right now. - Okay just do me a favor and cut her a little slack, would you? So this is what they call al dente. Not bad. (soft intriguing music) - Come on. - I have to go to the restroom. - Okay, hun. - What?! That really hot guy that you hooked up with is one of your students, seriously?! - It gets worse. - Oh my god, are you pregnant? - If only that's all it was. - Okay, is he underage? - Thankfully when I looked up his information, I saw that he turned 18 not long before that night. - (sighs) Well thank goodness he's an adult. - But a student at my school and it gets worse. - Worse than this possible scandal? - I don't know why. Maybe he's mad by how dismissive I was to him the morning after, but he seems to be targeting Bree. - Bree? - Yeah. He keeps hanging out with her. The school secretary said that he's troubled and he sent me a really creepy text. He took a picture of my underwear at the hotel and the text said, "Still thinking about you." - You have to do something to get this situation under control. - I am afraid of what tomorrow could bring at this rate. - I am here to support you, whatever you need, but you have to stop this kid. - But how? - Don't worry, we're gonna figure it out together. How far are you willing to go? - Hey. - Hi, what are you doing here? - I was just on my way to the drug store to pick up the stuff for my mom. I saw you and who is that, your dad? - Yeah, it's his night with me. My mom, to be honest, doesn't want me hanging out with you so much. I don't know what her deal is. Maybe she's just stressed. - Are you gonna listen to your mom or-- (soft intriguing music) - Is something wrong? - It's your eyes. They're a beautiful color. It's like they almost look like-- - Bree? - Hey, Mr. Sullivan. Hi. - Yeah and you are? - Dad, this is Ian. He goes to my new school. - Nice to meet you. I was just walkin' by and saw Bree and I wanted to say hi. - Yeah, I thought you said you were goin' to the bathroom. - Sorry, I just saw Ian outside when I was walking back. - Okay, food's getting cold. I think we should head back. - Nice to meet you, sir. - Yeah, have a good night. - Yeah. (soft foreboding music) - We're back. Do you wanna say goodnight to your mom? Teenagers. So was that Megan I saw leaving? - Yeah, she came over for a bit. - Okay, I'm gonna head back. Oh, I meant to tell ya. I met this new friend of Bree's. - A friend, who? - Some kid from her school. Ian. (intense foreboding music) What, you know this kid? - Yes, I told Bree I do not want her spending time with this boy. I have some information about him. - You know, I caught a weird vibe from him too. If you think he's bad for Bree, we need to keep him away from her. - Trust me, I know. (foreboding orchestral music) (dog barking) (crickets chirping) (keys jingling) (door lock clicking) (intense orchestral music) (muffled crosstalk) Hey Bree, remember what I told you about the Johnson boy. - How could I forget? You drilled it into my head the whole ride here. - Topic sentence, people. That means a complete sentence. - [Mrs. Truman] Attention: all students should remain in class as we conduct a locker check. (students groaning) - We've never had a locker check before. - I don't know, maybe it's someone stealing or something. - Did your mom say anything about this to you? - No, but she wouldn't anyway. - All right, all right, settle down. Settle down, come on. (soft intriguing music) - I can't say I'm surprised. It's Ian Johnson's locker. - So complete sentence has an active conjugated verb. Past, present or future tense. Not a participle, not a definitive phrase, not a relative clause. Come on. (door knocking) - Sorry, Mr. Bono. I need to see Ian Johnson. - I didn't do anything. - Now, son! (soft intriguing music) - All right, all right, let's get back. - That's not mine. - I found it in your locker. So if it's not yours, whose is it? The locker fairy? - You did this, didn't you? - Watch your mouth. - Follow me into my office please. - I'll be right outside, Mrs. Sullivan. - Thank you, Officer Compton. Let's go. I don't know what game you think you're playing, but it ends now. I've seen your record, Ian. I know you're one step away from breaking probation. I also know that you're over 18 now, so that means hard jail time. I've read up on you. The counselor notes, too. I know you're the only one that thinks you can take care of your mother. Do you really wanna leave her behind? - My family means everything to me. I'll do anything for the people I love. (soft foreboding music) So Kathy, you wanna lay your cards on the table? Are you sure you can handle that? - You are to stay away from my daughter or that knife goes on your record. - You know you're pretty sexy when you're angry. - Stop it. - I'm gonna make you pay. - Pay? Pay for what? Are you mad that I didn't return your disturbing text message? That night at the hotel was no accident, was it? - No. I've been tracking you. It's so easy when you're all over social media. Friends tagging you in posts can be your worst enemy. What you do, what you like, who you are. Your perfect husband, where you went to college. People are so stupid, putting their entire lives out there on social media for everyone to see. Does that make them feel better about their lives? Does that make you feel better, Kathy? It was not hard to track you. And when I saw you got the principal job at Riverview, I begged the school board to let me repeat my senior year. They felt so sorry for me. (scoffs) What a joke. (soft intriguing music) And then you posted about your girlfriend getaway in Miami at that fancy hotel. I knew if I came down there, I'd hookup with you and I did. You were so easy. - Why are you stalking me? - 'Cause you deserve it. (intense foreboding music) - You recorded it? What's wrong with you? - Is that worse than what you did? Have you really looked at me, Kathy? I love watching you squirm. - You need help. - No one here wants to help me. Look if you want me to keep this video to myself and stay away from your daughter, it's gonna cost you. Look, I want $50,000 by the end of this week. - How do you think I'm supposed to come up with that kind of money? I am a working mother. - Save the sob story for someone who cares, Mrs. Sullivan. I know that house is worth a pretty penny. - You don't know anything about me. - I'm sure you could come up with the cash if you really wanted to. - So what, I give into this blackmail? Then you'll never leave me alone. Ian, we're at a stalemate here. If you post that video, you go to jail. We both lose. - I just want the cash so we can get out of this godforsaken town. - Who's we? - It doesn't matter. - We both deal with the repercussions then. - So you're gonna test me. - I have no choice. I can't meet your demands and even if I could, I'd be under your thumb forever. - You're gonna regret this. - I'm gonna say it one last time, you stay away from my daughter or I swear you'll regret it. Officer? Mr. Johnson has been expelled. Please escort him off this campus. - Let's go, cupcake. (foreboding music) Good riddance. - Are you ready to go? - Yup. - Listen Bree, I wanna tell you that I expelled Ian. - What? Why? - We found a weapon in his locker. This is serious. You need to tell me if he comes near you. - He's the only one that cares about me. (dark foreboding music) (dog barking) - What the hell you doin' home? Got kicked out again, huh? What's new? I was told junior never end up bein' anything. Now that you're 18, you just get the hell out. (knife stabbing) (Boom wincing) I'm gonna get you. I'm gonna kill you. I'm gonna kill you! (foreboding orchestral music) (somber orchestral music) (birds chirping) - Felix? - No, no it's me, your son. Listen, I got that taken care of. Boom isn't gonna bother us anymore. She think she's gonna get away with it, but not this time. I'll protect us. You, me and my little sister, Bree. - Hello, Ian? It's Gina. - [Ian] What the hell are you doing here? - I followed you. I couldn't let you leave school without you knowing how I feel about you. Is this place why you cut me off? You didn't want me to see. - No no, you're a spoiled little rich girl. You have no idea. - Don't say that. I want you, Ian. You made me feel so great when we were together. No one has ever made me feel the way that you did. - Why are you so clueless? I only have time for family! - [Boom] Help me. (foreboding orchestral music) - Get out, get out! (Gina shrieking) If you tell anyone about coming here. - I'm sorry! I just wanted to let you know. - Fine. (window shattering) (Gina shrieking) If you say anything about coming here or anything about me, I'll do to your face what I just did to that car. Now you tell mommy and daddy that somebody broke in. Get out! (intense orchestral music) - No no, please. (bat bashing) - You know you're gonna have to talk to me eventually. I did what I had to do, Bree. He had a weapon. - Whatever, mom. (somber orchestral music) - I hope that this is finally over now, Megan. I still don't know why he targeted us. But there's something about him, I just can't put my finger on it. It's something in the way he looks. - No matter how many times I show her the chord, she's not going to get it. What's wrong? You seem off. - Nothing, I'm fine. I'm just going to class. (soft intriguing music) (wind chimes jingling) - Ian. Where's Boom? - I told you, ma. You don't have to worry about him anymore. I'm sorry, but I'm gonna have to leave you by yourself for a couple of days. I'll be back though and we'll get outta here. Forever. (somber piano music) (birds chirping) (intense orchestral music) (muffled crosstalk) Hey, hold up. Come on. Shh. - What's wrong? - What? Oh, nothing. - No seriously, what's-- - Ian. Ian, what are you doing here? - I had to see you. That knife wasn't mine, I swear. - You can't be here. You're gonna get in trouble. - I need to tell you something, it's important. Can we go hang out or go to breakfast or something? - I can't skip class. - Why not? Live a little, principal's daughter. - My mom will freak out if she finds out. - What's your mom got against me anyway? C'mon, this is to the back lot. The idiot security guard doesn't even keep his eyes on it. Please? It's important, I promise. If we're gonna go, we need to go now. - Okay. - Yeah. (intense foreboding music) - Miss Sullivan, did Bree go home early? - No, why? - Well it's just that Mr. Bono sent in his electronic attendance. She's marked as absent. - What? (eerie orchestral music) - You guys have got to remember your no-nos of sentence structure. No double negatives. Miss Sullivan. - Excuse me, I'm sorry for the interruption. Could I speak to you outside a minute? - Sure. I'll just take a minute, guys. Somethin' wrong? - My daughter Bree, have you seen her at all this morning? - No, I haven't. Gina, this is private. - Mrs. Sullivan, I think I know something about Bree. - Please, tell me what you know. - I saw Bree leave with Ian Johnson earlier. They went into the theater, probably taking that back exit to the parking lot. - That's a way for the kids to skip out unnoticed. - When did this happen? - Just before class. I should've said something earlier and I'm sorry. - No, thank you for telling me. I'm sorry, I have to go. (dark foreboding music) Bree sweetheart, where are you? - Lookin' for your daughter, Kathy? - You better not have hurt her. Why do you have Bree's phone? - Oh don't worry, she's fine for now. Took her phone out of her bag when she wasn't looking. - Where are you? Tell me! When the police find out-- - Ooh, big mistake. I wouldn't call the police or that uppity husband of yours. - What do you want from me? I told you I can't come up with that kind of money. - I want you to go straight to the bank and take out everything you have, then go home and get all the valuables. I'll call you with the drop-off place in two hours. - I wanna talk to Bree. I need to know she's okay. - Ooh, no dice. I'll send a picture. Remember, two hours. - Ian, Ian! (camera clicking) Oh my god, Bree. Hang in there, sweetie. - I thought we were getting breakfast. What's going on? - Change of plans, c'mon. (intense foreboding music) - Megan, meet me at my house. He's got Bree. - Why are you acting so strange? What'd you wanna tell me? - Did your mom ever cheat? - My mom? Oh god, no. Miss perfect. - People can surprise you. (soft intriguing music) - Where are we going now? This isn't the way back to school. - We're never going back there. - What? We have to. My mom! - Is a whore. Your mother is a whore, Bree. - Ian, you're scaring me. - People like your mom do whatever they want and get away with it and you don't need that in your life, Bree. You need real family. - You're not making any sense. Please, we have to go back to the school or just let me out here. I swear I won't say anything to anyone. (intense foreboding music) Oh my god, why do you have a gun?! - I want to protect us. I stole it from my no-good stepdad. - Ian, this doesn't make sense. - I want to protect you. You're my little sister. We have the same dad and your mother's the reason that he's dead. - I know I stashed some of the emergency money in here somewhere; where did I put it? - We have to call the police. Please, this is getting too dangerous. Please listen to me. After what you just told me, we have to call the police! - Didn't you hear me? He said if he even suspects the cops, he'll hurt her. We have to do what he says until we get Bree back, then we can call the police. Please Megan if you wanna help me, just listen to me. - Okay, I don't like this. We'll do it this way for now. - Thank you. Now go upstairs, get any jewelry you can find that's worth something. I don't care what it is. We have to get Bree back. - We will, I swear. (intriguing orchestral music) - What is this place? - My mom used to work here 'til she couldn't anymore. - Ian whatever this is about, you don't have to do this. I can't be your sister. Please listen to me. - I've been planning this for so long. I'd go online every day to try to find information to make your mother pay. (intense orchestral music) - I have no idea what you're talking about. You could just leave me here. I'll find my own way back. Please, my mom and I have done nothing to you. - Don't be so like that slut mom of yours. Look at your eyes, Bree. They're the same as my dad's, our dad's. I've seen all the pictures. - (weeps) My dad's name is Ben. You met him, remember? - Listen to me! Your mother had an affair with my father. She was a teacher and he was a custodian. That was 17 years ago. Don't you get that, Bree? Your my dad's kid and your mother is the reason that he's dead. - That can't be true! - They got into a car crash. They got into a car crash when they were arguing about your mom. They had a car crash and my dad, our dad died. And ever since then, my mom's been goin' downhill. She's been taking pills. My loser of a stepdad convinced her to marry him because he knew that we had a little bit of life insurance money left and she just keeps getting worse, Bree. I mean, I'm losing her. I mean gotta get her outta here. (both weeping) (poignant orchestral music) - Why hasn't he called? - The police, Kathy. - Not yet. - A year ago, my stepdad got drunk and told me everything including your mom's name. He worked with her and saw how your mom seduced my dad. - My mom wouldn't do that. - Once I knew your mom's name and a little bit of her background, I did my research. I saw that she was gonna be a principal at Riverview. Me and your mom had sex and I recorded it. - No, you're lying! (gun clanking) (foot bashing) (Ian wincing) (intense orchestral music) (Bree breathing heavily) - Bree, get back here. - Where the hell's my phone? - I'm tryin' to save you. Don't you understand, Bree? Tryin' to make your mom pay, not you. (soft orchestral music) (shoes clacking) We can get outta here forever. I'll take care of us, you, me and my mom. Bree. Bree, where are you? Come out, Bree. Come on. Bree c'mon, come out. C'mon, little sis. (feet shuffling) (boards clacking) (Bree breathing heavily) Don't, that'll kill you. (dark foreboding music) Don't do that. - What do you want from me? (sobs) (cellphone ringing) - It's him. - Ian, you better not have touched my daughter. - You're in on place to make demands, Kathy. You don't forget that. D'you bring the money? How much is it? - I've got about $5,000. It's all I could cash out today. I have some jewelry too. - That'll have to do for now. (intense foreboding music) Write this address down carefully and no police, Kathy. This'll turn deadly quickly. - [Kathy] This must be it. - [Megan] Is that his car? - [Kathy] I don't know. - If you don't come out in 10 minutes, I'm calling the police, understand? Kathy, do you hear me? - Okay, but 10 minutes. Gimme time to find her. (intense orchestral music) - Don't be scared. Once we get this cash, we're gonna blow this stupid town and go somewhere no one knows us. Then we're gonna start over and get away from this nightmare that your mother caused. - [Kathy] Bree! - Mommy's here. Upstairs and don't do anything stupid. (soft intriguing music) - Okay, just take it easy. - Mom. - Hang in there, sweetie. - Drop it there and step back. - Now let her go. - No, she's coming with me just like dad would've wanted. Look at me, really look at me. Do you not see any resemblance? Does all the pain you caused mean that little to you? - You're not making any sense, Ian. - Does the name Felix Johnson ring a bell? 'Cause you had his kid. - Oh my god. I see it now. I knew there was something familiar about you that night at the hotel. But Felix's son, the baby. His name was Derek. - That's my middle name. I stopped going by it when I went to school. Now see the family that you ruined? You destroyed our lives. - Is it true, mom? The things he's saying. Is dad not my father? Did you have sex with Ian? (somber orchestral music) - That's it, time's up. (phone ringing) - Answer her! - Okay, just don't hurt us. Sweetie, I'm so sorry. He's telling the truth. - What? - It was a complicated time. Your father and I were having problems in our marriage. Ian's father I, we just connected. He was having problems in his marriage too. - That's a lie. - It's the truth, Ian. Your mother, she wasn't well mentally back then. She constantly flew into jealous rages with your dad. I mean, for no reason 'til one day there was something to be jealous about. It only happened the one time, but it was enough. I got pregnant with you, Bree. - No. - I told Ben the truth, but he decided that he wanted to stay and raise you as his own. He's a good man. He loves you just as much as I do. Things were good for a while, for years. - See, I told you so. - Shut up, you monster. - Okay, chitchat's over. Time to get things movin'. - Then just let us go. You have what you want. The money, the jewelry. There is nothing that matters more to me than my daughter. Nothing! - Well things could've been so different. I could have my dad. Do you know how much that hurt? - I am so sorry, Ian. I truly am. It was a mistake that your father and I made. - Oh shut up, you tricked him. - You know that's not true. - Time to make you shut up. - No, no! - Bree! - Mom, mom! - Bree! (intense orchestral music) (muffled radio speech) - Mom, you have to be okay. - I'm so sorry, honey, for everything. I made a huge mistake and I never wanted you to have to pay for it. - I'm just happy you're alive. I should've listened to you. I'm so sorry. - You have nothing to be sorry about. I love you. - We're right here, Kath. We'll meet you at the hospital. - I love you, too. - Okay, guys. (soft orchestral music) (poignant piano music) - [Ian] Don't worry, mom. I'll be back for you, I promise. - Whoa whoa whoa whoa, nobody waits for me. Happy birthday. (both clapping) Muah, love you honey. - Thanks. - Okay, back to the meats. - You okay, mom? - I'm great, sweetheart. You just continue to grow up too fast. - I know. I've grown up a lot these past couple months. - All right, who's ready for my world-famous hamburger? - [Megan] World-famous, ha. - That's what he seems to think. - I'll go help. - Thanks, honey. - So, how are things going between you and Ben? - If anything came out of that nightmare, I think that we're starting to become a family again. (soft piano music) (birds chirping) - It's a little.
