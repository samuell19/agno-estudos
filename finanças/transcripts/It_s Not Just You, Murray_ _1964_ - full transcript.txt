[ORCHESTRAL FANFARE PLAYING] [ORCHESTRA PLAYS NOTE] Hi. See this tie? Twenty dollars. See these shoes? Fifty dollars. You see this suit? Two hundred dollars. See this car? Five thousand dollars. Want a ride? Come on. Hey, wait a minute. I forgot something. Cut the whole thing, will you? No, no, stop the camera. Just c-c-cut what I'm doing. 'Cause I want to— want to— [LAUGHS] I forgot to introduce myself. I'm Murray. And the reason I'm here is to tell you how I got here. I'm very rich. I'm very influential. I'm very well liked. I got lots of friends. But I'll tell you, this sweet life, this good living... is all due, I must admit, uh, to one person. And that's my friend, my pal, Joe. Hi. I'm Joe. MURRAY: I mean, in this fife you need help in trying to obtain for yourself the best possible life for yourself Ain't that right, Joe? That's right, Murray. MURRAY: Here's something. I want you to see this. Look over here. Here's some pictures of Joe when he was a kid. When he was about six or five. He always used to— And right here, it's a picture of him playing, uh, uh, football. That's right. That game, that was his favorite. That's him with the ball in his hand. And that's his graduation shot with the hat I could go on all day with these things. It's not important. What matters is this — I always wanted to live good, ever since I was a kid. You know? That's me there. And how do you live good? Well, for me, its going places. You know, meeting people and doing things. I mean, for me, that's good living. I mean, take my mother, for instance. The only psychology-type advice she ever give me, she said, "Murray, eat first." I mean, what kind of psychology— Who— So what, you know? But Joe, uh-uh, no, sir, not him. I mean, if it weren't for Joe, I wouldn't be where I am. I mean, I wouldn't be what I am. I wouldn't be who I am today. I mean, after all he did set me up in— in business. All right, now, I'm going back some 25, 30 years. You know what I mean. That stuff ready yet? It's okay. Okay? Yeah. Okay. [BOTH LAUGHING] [NO AUDIBLE DIALOGUE] [BOTTLE SHATTERS] MURRAY: Then things happened fast. I mean, I was really going places. You know, going places. All over. I mean, all over. Brooklyn. Jersey. Staten Island. I mean, really going places. [KNOCKING] But then again, you know, in this life, you only got so much luck. And events happen in life. - They take a furn. - [SHOUTING] And in the course of business, there occurred, uh, this... event, a misunderstanding, in... which, due to circumstances which I had no control, I was— Uh, unfortunately, I was misunderstood. [SHOUTING CONTINUES] And due to, uh, this misunderstanding... in which I was, uh, misunderstood, I didn't exactly have a great amount of free time to go many places for a while. Although I did see Ossining, New York. It wasn't bad up there, you know. I mean, Joe used to come to see me. And when he couldn't, uh, my mother. Well, you know my mother. Anyway, when I got out, Joe always gave me this advice. Murray, when anything ever happens to you... well, you've gotta learn to control yourself. You know, always control yourself Don't do anything. Don't say a word. You gotta stop. You gotta pull yourself together. You gotta take it easy. In other words, Murray, when people bother you, hit you, abuse you... curse you... You know what I mean, Murray? When they really, really bother you. Well, Murray, don't do nothing. No, sir. Because remember that one day, Murray, one day you're gonna see somebody, some guy who's all those other guys rolled into one, and then you can give him... all he deserves. MURRAY: Anyway, that's how I met my wife. You know, a real— an angel of mercy type, you know? Uh, with the white dress and the white shoes. I mean, if it weren't for Joe, I never would've been in the hospital. Right? And I never would've met my wife. Anyway, after that, then we really started to do things, you know. I mean, we really did do— We did things, you know?

I mean, all kinds of shows for all kind's of people in all kinds of places. I tell you, what followed that was the fostering of one of the greatest financial syndicates in America. All places, all people and all things have been affected by us in one way or another. Um, motel chains have been affected by us. Politics have been affected. Undertaking services. [MACHINE GUN FIRES] We hit our mark there. Television, when it come out, had been affected. Sports have been affected. So many things, like, uh, private grants and foreign aid have been affected. I tell you, even a vast amount of imported products have been affected. I could go on all day about what have been affected, but I won'. Therefore, you were virtually unavailable that night between the hours of 9:00 to 12:00, Eastern Standard Time, Daylight Savings Time, 9001012:00 west of the Mississippi, and when the moon was at three-quarters and five-eighths on December 12 during the latter half of the night, due to preliminary rain that afternoon at 8:00 p.m. Now, you gotta answer that. I, uh— Is this thing working? - [MEN SHOUTING] - [GAVEL BANGS] SENATOR: Quiet, or I'll clear the room. I refuse to answer on the grounds, um, it may "incriminal" me. On the grounds I may discriminate myself. - [OVERLAPPING CHATTER, SHOUTING] - Here he comes! MURRAY: An empire of wealth and security. Built from what? From nothing. Nothing but the love of one's fellow man in friendship. - Great, huh? Great. Great, huh? Great. MURRAY: Everything we did, we did together. Joe and me. Friendship, love, life, family. We worked hand-in-hand. Yes. Family. I'll tell you, to my family, to my kids, you know, my children... Joe was like a second father. And when it come to my wife, um... Hey, Joe. Uh, could you come in here for a minute? JOE: Now, Murray, look. I know what you're thinking. But look at it this way— MURRAY: Al right. Cut the sound. JOE: Murray, come over here a minute, will you. MURRAY: Cut the sound. JOE: So the kids look like me— -Cut the sound. You there, with the glasses. Cut the sound. Cut— [NO AUDIO] [MURRAY CHUCKLES] You know, it's a funny thing. I mean, Joe and me has always been great friends. I mean, great friends. And just this once, we had this— how should I say— a misunderstanding. But now everybody's here. I mean, ifs embarrassing. I won't say I'm not embarrassed. Joe explained everything to me. And like he says, times change, things change. You gotta move with the times. I mean, take my wife. She's still my wife. She still lives with me, she lives in the house, and she goes to parties with me and the kids. They re good-looking kids. And they still live in my house. They're my kids. So Joe says I ain't gonna win no Fathers Day award or Father of the Year. It ain't gonna kill me, you know. [LAUGHS] We are very happy people. We got everything that we want. Uh, modesty prevents my divulging my, uh, true income. But, like, they're bringing over this new car tomorrow. I mean, imported Naugahyde. Formica bar in the trunk. All the latest. If you're in the neighborhood, come on over, fake a look. Ten thousand dollars. [ORCHESTRAL MUSIC PLAYING] [NO AUDIBLE DIALOGUE]
