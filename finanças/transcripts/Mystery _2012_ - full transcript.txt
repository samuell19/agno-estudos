We fucked up! Went too far this time. Is this a car crash scam? Let go! You fucking let go of me! Jiaming! Jiaming! You're kicking her to death! Fuck off! - Stop! - She looks dead. Actually, we can make the FS controller. We delivered it to NS on schedule last time. As for the SMD and SMT, we can definitely make it. Tell them to have faith in us. NOW? We've been making ECU for PT Electronics. In large quantities. Where's your mum? - Hi. Are you An'an's mum? - Yes. You're such a pretty girl. Just like your mum. Your son is cute, too. Let's exchange numbers. We can take the kids out together. Sure. My name is Lu Jie. Yours? Sang Qi. - Bye, An'an. - Bye. Daddy. You're early today. Come here. A big hug- Did you miss Daddy? Were you good today? Change into your slippers. Go on, tell your dad. She fell, a bad one. - Did it hurt? - She's got a bump. Where? Mrs Wei, what did you make? I've made soup. Two little bees Flying happily in the garden Flying...- - ' Flying...- - ' Do you know that you frown in your sleep these days? Do I? Are you tired? I'm fine. Let me do a bit more. Is work stressing you out? We just got a big order. If we make it, it'll cover the rest of the year. Don't you want a new car? I'm not that bothered. It's not worth ruining your health. Do you need my help? Why? Isn't it good that you take care of An'an? I don't want you to be too tired. I read in a magazine that women grow stupid after giving birth. Don't you think so? Which magazine was that? It makes sense. No... I know you're smart. But it's so unstable out there. Even the trip to school isn't safe. I fear for An'an unless you take care of her. All right? The phone... Who is it? It's that person again. - Who? - The one who calls at night. Who is it exactly? Maybe you are too sensitive. Impossible. It's the fourth time this month. I'll go to the phone service to check it out. Don't worry just yet. Call the police if it keeps happening next month. Boys and girls! Stand in a circle. Look at that saggy body. Will we be like that when we're old? Lu Jie! Calm down. I want to play ping pong. Done with the shower? Do you know the schedule? Please be on time. Thanks. Thank you, miss. Bye-bye. Lu Jie, we're taking off, then. Bye. Sang Qi. Yuhang. Get in the car quickly. Get in! It's pouring all of a sudden. There's a dry towel behind the seat. What a downpour! Let's start. One, two, three, four... Four! I learned tap dancing today. Sang Qi, please show me the way. Keep going straight. Turn at the light. Go! - Are you all right? - Yes. Run, Yuhang! Lu Jie, will you be available tomorrow afternoon? I've got something on. I want to have a chat with you. Never mind. We'll talk tomorrow, then. Get in! Sang Qi. - Sorry I'm late. - Don't worry about it. - Have you been waiting long? - No. I was doing something near here. What's going on? You look upset. I think my husband is having an affair. Oh, no. Are you sure? I saw him coming out of a hotel, with a girl. I checked his mobile, but didn't find anything peculiar. It's hard to say. You know, there are cafes and conference rooms in hotels. They were probably having a meeting. Did you ask him? I think you'd better not ask him yet. It might be a mistake. - Or it will seem... - See? Look at those two. People who go to a hotel at this time of day must be cheating. Should I check his phone again? Or have the mobile service print out an itemized bill? Maybe I'll find something. Lu Jie, what's wrong? Aren't you feeling well? My chest aches. We'll chat another time. All right, Sang Qi? - Can I stay with you? - No, thanks. You go ahead. The bill, please. - You don't need me to stay? - I'm all right. Hello, I'm busy at the moment. I'll call you back later. Wait for me. Let's go. What can I do for you, madam? Madam? Can I use the restroom? Hui, it's me. I just saw Yongzhao with a girl, walking out of a hotel. Am I overreacting? Of course it's true! I won't. I won't. Ying Gui Yuan Hotel. I'll be waiting for you. Please hurry. Yongzhao. Didn't you promise to wait? What kind of a man are you? You're always like this. I found the bracelet. Yes. On the bed. The number you have dialled is busy. Please try again later. Can I see you next Saturday or Sunday? All right. Go back to your work. Where are you? Where? I know, I know. Where are you now? I can't see you. Wait for me. Keep going. There you are. Mummy. Hello. Lu Jie, I'm coming in. What's the matter? Lu Jie. What happened? Please. What happened? An'an is just downstairs. Am I hurting you? I'll be gentler. Am I hurting you? I love you, Lu Jie. I love you. She came out of nowhere. I couldn't steer away. I want to go home. Please cooperate with us. I'm hurt, I want to go home! You'll be fine. Don't panic. Get hold of my dad! Xiaomin. Madam. Take her over there. Have a seat. Calm down. You're damaging your health. We've identified the deceased. Her name is Sun Xiaomin. A college student, living with her mother. The crime scene, the mud on her body, we've established that she rolled down the slope. We can't quite confirm the details yet. The deceased's head was injured by a rock. According to our analysis, someone hit her on the head with a rock. And on her chest and belly, there is obvious bruising. We think that she was kicked after the accident. Sit down. She did it on purpose. It was a scam. People like her deserve to die. - I didn't do anything wrong! - Sit down. She deserved it! Why are you blaming me? - You two, over here. - Why are you doing this to me? Young man, don't get so upset. - Be quiet. - I'm the victim! - I know. - And I'm wounded! I want to go home! Calm down. Keep your voice down. Help me, brother. My father is You Qaing. I'll reward you once I get out. - Help me. - Go! Sir, look at this. This is the driver's father, a big shot in business, president of Wan Ming Corp. His name is You Qiang. And here, we've got the victim's mobile. Look at this text message. Let me see. Qim Fang, you're a good man, but forget about me. QM Fang. Bye. What's up? Is it your treat or mine? I read your last text to your ex-girlfriend. Fuck off! How could you see my text? She's dead. Seriously? Car accident. When did you last see her? You're still not over it? Lu Jie. Sang Qi. Sorry about last time. My husband and I made up. It was a mistake. That's good. Making up this time doesn't mean forever, though. Lu Jie, shall we go to a spa? My treat. Not today. Thank you, though. - Bye, Lu Jie. - Bye. Yun Lin Hotel, room 503. This number is not in service. Police officers are waiting for you. They've been here a while. Take my bag. - Hello. I am Qiao Yongzhao. - Hello. Hello. Do you know this girl? All the people I met after seeing her that day. They can testify. We'll talk to you again if necessary. I have a favour to ask you. I'm married. You saw my wife's photo. I'd like to keep this from her. I only slept with the girl once. It will depend on the investigation. Bye. Delete contact Time for bed. I'm going upstairs. Sang Qi, a parcel for you. Sign here. Who is it, Mum? The postman. Goodbye. Yuhang. Go to the dinner table. - Do you need a hand? - No. We have enough time. Don't put it on. New dress? Come here. What's up? How's the Xiaomin case coming along? Probably classified as a car accident. Her mum agreed on it. It'll depend on how much the driver's father offers. What about her boyfriend? Qiao Yongzhao? We looked into him. He seemed beyond suspicion. He's married, one kid. He had a one-night stand with Xiaomin. It happens a lot. Do you still think of her? What are you talking about? She was a friend of mine. Wouldn't you care if one of your friends passed away? May her soul rest in peace. You told me the first time you met her was right there? Please. Another six bottles. What did I say when I was drunk last night? Don't laugh, tell me. Would you cook me something? I'm leaving. Give me a minute. Yongzhao! Yongzhao! What's up? Don't touch me! Come here, An'an. Mummy and Daddy need to talk. Go watch TV. - Someone must have set me up. - Can you explain? - I said, someone set me up. - How? Set you up with a girl on your arm? I don't know how to explain it. Anyway, it's not what you think. Did I do anything wrong? - It's not your fault. - So what? I know it's my fault. I didn't want this. I got this email, too. I don't know who sent it. Please trust me. Trust me. All right? Sang Qi. Wait. What's wrong? Nothing. Let's go shopping- I don't want to go now. Come on! Let's go. To New World. Hello. Have a look at the Korean clothes. I agree. The colour's pretty. The scarf. How much is it? - 3,980 RMB. It's fox fur. - It's too expensive. Thanks. This one is stylish. Try it on. Try it on if you like it. I don't have clothes like this. It shows off your waistline at the back. You should take it. The back's really nice. No, Lu Jie. I don't have that much cash. I'll lend it to you. All right. - Drive safely. - Bye. What brought you here? I was shopping nearby, so I just stopped by. What did you get? What do you think? The shirt. It's nice. Your credit card is maxed out! As long as you're happy. I went shopping with An'an's classmate's mum. The boy named Yuhang. She didn't have money on her and she wanted to borrow some. I lent it to her. What could I do? I was ashamed to say no. She was kind of weird. She bought the exact same shirt. Don't you think that's weird? Take if off! Take if off! Why? Why did you borrow money from her? What did you promise me when you sent Yuhang to that school? You promised not to meet her. You're fucking everything up! What do you think you're doing? Bitch! Bitch! Mum, Dad, open the door! Yuhang. I'm coming, Yuhang. Mum and Dad are still talking. Just one second. Mum, Dad, open the door! I'm sorry. Promise me. Don't ever meet with her again. We'll live our own life. Don't go and see her. Never again. Don't go and see her. Yuhang. Get over here. Play well. Practise. Dad will buy you a big piano. Keep practising. I love you. I love you, too. What's up? I found it at the crime scene. Where did you park? The case is closed. I know. What's the conclusion? A private settlement. Out of court. The victim's mother will get compensation and an apartment. You said she had a head wound caused by a rock. So what? "So what?" Keep looking into it. It's probably linked to her death. Report to your superior. I know what I have to do. But I'm telling you, this case is not under my control. And I don't care about those private affairs! Sang Hailan. Lu Jie, you're such a character. It was you who sent the email. And the shirt... Your acting skills are remarkable. Yongzhao was taken in. He blamed me. By the way. I'm not paying you back for the shirt. His money is either spent on you or on me. Lu Jie. Let's wait and see. Bye. Are you going to hit me? Do you know who Yuhang's father is? Where were you? An'an. Your teddy bear is back. Isn't he your favourite? A gift from Yuhang. Do you know Yuhang? The woman I went shopping with last time is his mother. Come here. A cute boy. Looks just like you when you were a child. - Miss Zhou. - Where is Yuhang? An'an's mum took him. She said you asked her to. - Thanks. - You're welcome. Yuhang. Mummy! I knew you wouldn't hurt Yongzhao's son. Let's play, An'an. Come in, please. On the day of your second miscarriage, we went to a hotel and the same night, I got pregnant. If it wasn't for the child, he would have probably just played with me, like he did with the other girls. His mother really wanted a boy. And he's such a mama's boy. I bet you know that. She even gave our baby a name. She calls all the time. Don't you mind that he has other women? Of course you do, or you wouldn't have taken me to the cafe or sent that text. My plan was to use you to keep them away. You didn't expect me to leave, too. You must be happy. Will you stay with him if he has nothing? All I want is him. I've known hard times. I'm not afraid of anything. Did you know we went to college together? This place reminds me of the old days. - An'an? - What? Let's go home. Come on. Bye, Yuhang. Daddy's here to pick you up. See? Yuhang. Let's go. Daddy's home. Go home with Mummy. We'll talk when I get back. Just go. Bitch! Sang Qi. Do you think ruining my life will bring us closer? Bastard! Bastard! I know everything. I saw it all. I asked Lu Jie there on purpose. We both saw you and the girl enter the hotel. You weren't satisfied with the two of us? Why did you see that girl? The girl died. In a car accident. Let's not talk about someone who passed away. It's all your fault. All your fucking fault! Lu Jie. I'm taking my stuff. You can live here for now. In three days, you'll get a letter from my lawyer. An'an is leaving with me. I'm now in charge of the company. You're no longer involved. I've told the accountant. You can have this month's pay. An'an. Time to go. I've paid the maid. If you don't come home for dinner... ls Daddy coming? He's not. It's just the two of us. Just give her a call. Let me talk to An'an. Whenever you miss Daddy, tell Mum to give Daddy a call. Daddy will come to see you, all right? Be a good girl. Promise me. Will you miss Daddy? You're home. - Did you eat? - Not yet. - Eat with us. - No, thanks. Daddy. Taxi. Taxi! Open the trunk, please. No. Go and change it. This is useless. - Look. - It's beautiful! It's a two-bedroom apartment. South facing. It enjoys good natural light. Here's the bank book. The bank card. And the agreement. Hey, Tong! Let me buy you a meal! Why are you so grouchy? Are you playing the hero with me? Who the fuck do you think you are? Who are you? Just a rotten cop! A rotten cop! Go away! Wait, Yuhang. Wait! Go away! What's wrong? Are you... Are you still thinking about them? Don't be oversensitive. Aren't we together now? We'll be happy ever after. Don't think too much. Actually, I'm happy now. I want to be with you forever, just like this. Growing old together. The guy... ...came to see me again. What did he want? Money. Didn't you give him money already? He wanted more. And this time, he followed me home. He saw Yuhang. I've got it. I'll think about a solution. But what? Is it here? This is the last time I pay you. Go near her again and I'll kill you! Daddy, what's that on your neck? Are you cold? Hey, buddy! - Do you live here? - Yes. A quick question. What is it? Have you seen the guy with a straw hat who lives around here? No. Think again, please. No. Help! Are you Lu Jie? Hello. We need to talk to you. Take a seat. Tell me, when did you lose it? And where? I don't know where I lost it. It was a while ago. Do you know your husband was having an affair? We're divorcing. Right. Your ex-husband. Did you know? Do you know the girl? When you hit her with the rock, did you want to punish her or kill her? Here's the situation. Your ex-husband's mistress is dead. She was hit on the head with a rock. And we found your keyring at the crime scene. We have sufficient reason to believe that you killed her. Remember anything? Try harder. It might help you. Or you'll be in big trouble. I really don't remember.
