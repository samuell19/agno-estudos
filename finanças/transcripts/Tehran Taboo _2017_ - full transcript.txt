Sign the papers and let me go. Go see Mamad. Tell him you need some shit. There's a guard on our side. He'll help us. Three packs is enough to get me on my feet. Where are you going? You don't know Mamad's address! What are the photos for? For court. So we need a dark background. Much better. ISLAMIC REVOLUTIONARY COURT That man dishonored us. He must be punished. My daughter's virtue was stolen. She's out there sitting in the hall, crying her eyes out. - I won't drop the case. - Elias. These are your options: marriage or life imprisonment! Hello, Your Honor. The file is incomplete. Come back when you have everything. But you didn't check. Your husband's authorization? No, but - Come back with written permission.

I've got a nice apartment around here. It will be empty soon. I'm sure you'll find it to your liking. See, what did I tell you? Come in, sweetie. Try and guess which room will be yours. Look at that! Wow, it's so beautiful! What a kitchen! We'll buy a microwave. We can make pizzas. And this bathroom! We can finally take showers at home. This will be my room. My very own. I'll buy a white bed.

It's the location. it's not right for you. They're all idiots. Take this and cheer up. Have some fun. Enjoying yourself? Without him, I would be in here. I don't want any. Hello? Oh, hi! I'm up and already working. Sleep well? What? In the park in an hour. See you there. - Really your first time? - Of course. What did you think? No offense. - I mean... - I'm getting married next week. I need to be a virgin again by then. It's better to walk. Last night, you forgot your groom is expecting a virgin? It's that stuff you gave me. - What will you do now? - Me? You're in as much trouble as me. This is no joke. You must pay for the operation, or my fiancé will kill us both. What operation? Hey, where the hell are you? In bed, where else? Amir, I'm in really deep shit. Then take a shower before you come! - Are you married? - Bring him in! - We didn't do anything! - Nothing? You were holding hands in public! Step aside. I said step aside! DORMITORY MORAL CODES NO WOMEN ALLOWED Come in. They'll catch you one day. So what? I'll have fun till then. What's with the long face? The girl from last night wants me to pay for her operation. What operation? Did you bite off her nose? She said I took her virginity. Really? If I don't pay for the operation, her fiancé will kill me. The wedding is next week. We have plenty of time. Throw me that towel. How much does the operation cost? No idea. Two or three stitches shouldn't cost much. We'll see. Do you know someone? It takes a gynecologist. Is my lipstick alright? It's a walk-in procedure. It costs 600,000 tomans. She can leave in two hours. A certificate from a medical examiner is mandatory. Medical examiner? Isn't that for dead people? They also determine if the cause was accident or rape. - It was an accident, right? - Yeah, sure. We'll be back with the certificate. Signed parental consent is also required. What now? You had a med student girlfriend. Can she help us? Forget her. She caught me with Soraya. I'm lucky she didn't dissect me! Even if I get the certificate, what about parental consent? DR. PARIA MEHRABI - GYNECOLOGIST Everything looks fine this time. You'll be a mother soon. - Really, Doctor, are you sure? - We can never be absolutely sure. But mother and baby appear healthy. Next checkup in two weeks. Thank you, Doctor. Sara, dear, this baby is a wonderful gift you're giving us. For your husband, and for us. My husband will be so happy. Being a mother is a gift from God. You're very blessed. Are you listening? I know what I'm talking about. Did you hear me, Sara? Go inside. I must buy something. There's no need. I shopped this morning. I need some books. More books? I'll never understand what they are good for! What are the photos for? - Job application. - Private or state? Private. Then let's use a light background. That's better. Smile! PROSPERITY INSURANCE Dad, I'm home! Heavenly wives... Your wish has finally been granted. You'll be a grandfather! - Boy or gill? - Hi, Mohsen. Hello, dear Sara. I'm so happy. - You brought me joy. - Thanks. Hey, Mom! To protect against foreign influence, satellite dishes are being confiscated... Sara, dear, let's finish the salad first, then bring the soup. We don't want it to get cold. Of course, Mother. - We're having guests? - Yes. Our special little guest! Where's my medicine? Mohsen, did you pick up his medicine? I forgot. I'll go now. Elias, hurry! The elevator is here. Let me help you. Thanks. That's very kind. - You live here? - Yes, top ﬂoor. Then we're neighbors. We just moved in. - Welcome. - Thanks. Thank you, that wasn't necessary. Please don't bother. No problem. Ask if you need more help. I will, thank you. Hello, I hope you like the apartment. If there's a problem, call Ahmad. He's the janitor. The neighbors have his number. Bye, kitty cat. Little bastard! I'm all wet! Hi, Amir. Found a solution? I found a fake hymen made in China! Fake? How does it work? How else? It's a fake hymen! - Don't make things worse. - Keep cool. OK, see you tomorrow. WOMEN ONLY - Hello? - Any news? Hey, no. Well... yes, I think so. - Yes or no? - Listen... Operations are old-fashioned. There are modern alternatives. - What do you mean by modern? - There are artificial hymens. - I'm getting one. - Where? Screw you! How can such a bad driver survive on the streets of Tehran? Hi. Hi. Why the hell did you bring her? - Need more trouble? - She invited herself. I couldn't say no. That's why you always end up in deep shit. Saying no is more important than breathing in Tehran! It's here. Wait with her. Hello, Javad, how are you? Naser, a customer! - Hello. - Hello. This is the original model. 100% Chinese. You know it's good because the Westerners copied it. Take it. It can be useful. How does it work? Easy. Open and insert. That's all. She'll be good as new. Tell him the story about fat-ass Fati. It's simple. Put it in her, close your eyes, and fat-ass Fati becomes a fresh young virgin again! And the blood and stuff? So you're into special effects... like blood! Shit, my fiancé! You touch, you buy! - Take it to my car. - At your service, sir. What's wrong? What was that crap? I didn't know it was bullshit. Hey, we tried. There's this doctor that does everything. Without certificates. - Those jokers told you that? - Yeah, well. It's a tricky operation. It takes skill. Another doctor won't see what I've done after. But that comes with a price. Please help us out. I know people. I'll send you other customers. Don't touch! Everything's disinfected. Know how much disinfectant costs on the black market? There are others who charge less. They don't stitch tightly enough! I staple it so hard, she'll be a virgin for life! Three million. Final price! How long does it take? Depends when she arrives. Bring her in the morning. She can leave by noon. EMPLOYMENT AND SOCIAL AFFAIRS It's all in order. You're hired. I'll send you the contract. Thank you. One moment. Don't forget we need your husbands signed consent. He must fill out this form, and bring it in person. Why this form? You have his name on file. - Isn't that enough? - We must respect the law. Shoo, dirty pest! The last thing we need. You feed it once and you'll never be rid of it. The poor thing is starving. Who could that be now? Hello. - Come in. - Sorry to disturb you. Not at all, come in. Sara, bring the lady some tea. Please, have a seat. How old are you, dear boy? He's five. He's mute. Hello... Thank you. Poor thing. But he isn't deaf? No, he just doesn't speak. You and your husband must come and have dinner with us tonight. That's kind, but Elias's father is away. He's a truck driver. Oh, then you come alone. Thanks, but I'm working tonight. What do you do? - I'm a nurse. - I see. That must be hard on your son. He goes with you? I wish I could leave him with someone. We would be happy to watch him. Sara is pregnant. It will be good practice for her. - Congratulations. - Thanks. That's really so kind of you. Isn't this great, Elias? Let's go, sweetie. Elias will come by later. With pleasure. Nice to meet you. What's the photo for? School. Private or state? Not sure. Let's say state. Then we need a dark background. Look serious, son. Show us you're a little man. You don't understand. Enrollment has closed. I'm sorry. We just moved into the neighborhood. It's complicated. The Board of Education is very strict. There must be some way. Mr. Sufi! This tea tastes like dishwater! I'll bring some more. Couldn't you make an exception? This isn't a bazaar, ma'am. There are regulations to follow. Do you know any sign language? Mr. Sufi! Stupid cow! Shitty woman! "Temporary marriage, " as we popularly call the sigeh, is a gift of our religion. Tell me, child... what do you do at the hospital while your mother works? There must be many pretty nurses. Anyone you like? The wingspan is ten feet? It's written here. A person could ﬂy with that! My job application was accepted. Really? I just need your authorization. I thought this topic was over. You said you would consider it. You can't work during pregnancy. My salary is enough for us. It's not about the money. End of discussion. It's not good for the baby. What if I lose the baby again? What are you saying? Sara, dear. Have you read those books? Can I throw them out? Mom, I'll find space for your vase. He's finally asleep. Hide the sweets. Put them way in the back. He's diabetic. He shouldn't eat sweets. - Good morning. - Good morning. Come in, Sara. Excuse the mess. Chaos at the hospital... Accidents, stabbings, brawls... The things people do! What we call order is only customary chaos. Elias, was it fun with Sara? How's the baby? Fine. All should go well this time. This time? I had two miscarriages. Sorry, I didn't mean to pry. Son of a bitch! Let's go out for breakfast. We already ate. Let's go out for dinner. I must watch over my ailing father-in-law. Your husband could do that for one evening. If I eat out, my mother-in-law will think I don't like her cooking. I'll talk to her. I'll pick you up, OK? See you later. Bye. Hi, is Babak home? Awesome, sounds way better! - You're here. - Hey, man. Like it? Totally. - What's it for? - I want permission to release it. You're dreaming. They don't consider that music. It wouldn't sell anyway. But do a percussion mix and you'll rock every party. I swear! Leave me alone. - Are you upset? - Forget it. - Babak! - Whatever. Stop sulking, man. When did you start smoking weed? Pass it around. Thanks. When I get the money, I'll buy a passport and ﬂy out of here. America, Europe, wherever. Think it's better elsewhere? Maybe not. But they don't hang people for nothing. And the money for the operation? What about that sound studio job? it's easy money. I'd rather mop ﬂoors than make crap music. More useful. A bank loan? How's your father? His blood sugar is still high. Can't your wife watch him? Some assistance, please... Think about yourself. He has always been there for me. I can't abandon him. - Excuse me, sir - - One moment. Yes? I would like information about a loan. How much? Three million. Your profession? Student. But I also give music lessons. Do you own property? No. Impossible... Next! But - Please, I would like... Babak I'm scared my fiancé will suspect something. I'm trying my best. Things will work out. I'm at the bank, seeing about a loan. Keep me posted. I have to go. OK. I can't give you more than 10,000. ISLAMIC CULTURE DEPARTMENT I'd like to check if my album has received a distribution permit. Rejected. Not conforming to Islamic values. Tehran Burger... We need official authorization to record. Don't you need money? Of course. More emphasis on "eat." Playing parties isn't really your thing? No. It's so popular, but it only opened recently. Hello, ladies. Hello. Where's Ahmad? At the hospital with his daughter. I'm covering for him. Poor man... And you are? I'm his nephew, ma'am. Tell him hello. I will, thank you. That young man is very polite. Sure, if you say so. Hold the ladder, kid. Great meal... Shouldn't we go? - Some coffee first. - Coffee? Thank you. Your mother-in-law insisted that I read your coffee grounds. So that's your trick! Boy or gift? That is the question. I'm glad we met. You have a lovely family. Your baby is lucky. - You work nights often? - Recently, yes. Which ward? Emergency. Elias, careful not to get ice cream on your clothes. I said hold the ladder! Did you go to university? Yes, I studied literature. - I really want to teach. - Does it pay well? It's not about the money. I want to feel useful. Staying at home is tedious. You can't imagine. You have a good profession. And my coffee grounds? Well... Let's see. Boy or girl? I told you to hold the ladder! What's distracting you? Boy, where are the sweets? Where are they? Headmistress, he's only a boy. He doesn't realize what he did. Forgive him. He'll behave better. Rules are rules. You're wasting my time. Stupid bitch! - They serve alcohol. - Don't miss out. I don't care about booze. Getting wasted at Darband parties is the best. You'll see. Hey, can someone lend me money? My dad didn't send mine yet. Maybe she gives student discounts? Relax. It's open. How are you? There's still no reverse. Avoid dead ends. - You're not coming? - No way. I need to study. I recorded the chords. That should do. What's going on? The med students snuck in another woman. I swapped the fake Chinese thing for some sexy magazines. Study well! Hello? Tell me. The magazines are in the trunk! Are you kidding? There will be a lot of chicks there. It will be great. Where's my son? He was around. Damn it. Son of a bitch! Why the hell did you do that? What are you doing here? 648579 - How much? - Asshole! Hello? Elias! Thank God! I was so worried. Where were you? He was on the dorm rooftop. I don't know how. He wouldn't tell me. He's mute. What were you thinking? My heart almost stopped. Where are you going? I can take you. - Thanks, that's nice. - You're welcome. Don't go out of your way. No problem. I live in your neighborhood. I can drop you off, then I'm heading up north. North? In this car? To the seaside? I wish. I'm playing music at a wedding. It pays well enough to drive 250 miles? I promised to help pay for a friend's operation. Wow, what a generous guy! We can get out here, thanks. I want to repay you. Think of me if anyone needs a DJ. Deal. Bye! Sara, please go buy some cheese. No, ma'am. I can't do it. It's too dangerous. Please make an exception. Just this once. I'll never bother you again. I'll pay double. You don't realize. I'm risking execution! I beg you. Please leave, ma'am. You're wasting my time and yours. Documents. Where are you going? North, to visit relatives. Nice. Open the trunk. Gifts for your relatives? Get in the truck. - They're legal. - I'm the one who decides what's legal. Excuse me, sir... For your colleagues. - How's it going? - I can't talk. I'm stuck at a checkpoint. Call me back soon. It could take hours. But I'll call back. Babak Maghsoudlou? You can go. What you're looking for is in the other box. Come closer. I give you books, but you only care for this album. Your grandfather... May he rest in peace. That's us. I love that baby picture. At the seaside. We had so much fun. Is your mother home? - Come in. - Hello. Mohsen isn't home, Sara is out too. I know nothing about insulin shots. Then I remembered our neighbor is a nurse! Could you give my husband his shot? Sure. I'll turn the oven off, then come down. Thanks. We're screwed. No. He gets it in the belly, where he's stretching the skin. With all that hospital stuff, amputating arms and legs, we can forget the basics... Crazy, right? May God heal the sick. Amen! What are the photos for? Marriage license. - Congratulations. Let's use a colorful background. Can I have one without the scarf? - Only if it's alright. - Of course! A smile would be better. Young man. - Do you know Donya? - Yes, I do. What's your relationship? Nothing. She asked me to help her buy an instrument. I'm a music teacher. She didn't tell me. Maybe it's a surprise. Listen. If I see you with her again, you're a dead man. Son of a bitch! - Hi. - You're late. The usual traffic jams. This one's good. That should do. Tomorrow is the big day. I met your friend. That music teacher. I recommend that you forget him. Of course. The best burger you'll ever eat! 157 Bustan Avenue in the Pasdaran district... To Vanak! You're the third pregnant woman I take to Vanak today. I'm not pregnant. We haven't arrived yet! You pimped out your car. Not only my car. I invest in women. I got what it takes. Even money. So why drive a cab? For fun. I do it when I'm bored. PIMP MOTHERFUCKER We'll get out there. I had those roses planted to surprise my wife. Where did you send her? To the seaside. The salt air will do her good. - What's wrong with her? - Asthma. Poor woman can hardly breathe. Under your weight, a healthy woman can hardly breathe. What about my divorce papers? I'm starting to feel like you're playing me. I need that fixed. Should I call the servants to help you undress? Where's my allowance? Here's three months allowance. Your envelopes are losing weight. So you say. But don't forget you're living in my apartment. What a thigh! Better than your new girl's? New girl? The one you dropped me for yesterday. Her? No one gives me what you do. So you'll sign the papers? You want to play? I'll show you. You like it rough? Is that it? Enough, let go! Not so tight! Stop it, bitch! I can hang you, disgusting whore! You told me the harder I pull, the more you get off. I didn't ask to be strangled. That bastard has some bad habits. - Hi. - Hi, how are you? - Come in. - I came to pick up Elias. Stay awhile. Where have you been hiding? I missed you. A glass of wine? Do you have chewing gum? So worried about covering up! I must have some. Strawberry, yummy! Sometimes you need that ﬂavor boost! Yogurt comes in all ﬂavors, so why not those too? - Poor men! - What poor men? They can't complain. There are two types of untrustworthy men: the first kind and the second kind. What's the difference? None. They're all the same. Too many to fit in one group! In my opinion, not all men are alike. That shy Yusef can't make eye contact with a woman. The janitor? You got his number? Yes. Watch. - Hello, who's this? - Hello. Who's this? Hello. - I'm looking for hottie Yusef. - What's this about? I want to do stuff with him. OK, I'm listening. - Are you alone? - Yes, alone. I'm looking for a man who gives his all. - Is that you? - Yes! Is your cock big? I need it nightly. Can you help? Sure, where are you? Near the mosque. Meet me now? Wait, I'm on my way! It's strange. Everything seems so open and free from down here. - Excuse me... - Are you done? No, I wanted to ask about my pay. I completely forgot to go to the bank. I'll pay tomorrow. Shoo, pest! Do you know where the cat gave birth to her kittens? Can you tell me? You don't know anyway. Elias, where are you? Look what I found. My old children's books. They were in the basement. The grocer said they're looking for a prostitute. She's the one who harassed Ahmad's nephew by phone. They say the number can be traced. Ahmad knows someone with the Morality Police. They'll track her down. Today's young women are shameful. Maybe she was joking. Joking? Let's see how funny she finds prison. I'm looking for a man who gives his all. Is that you? I need it nightly. Can you help? Maybe she was joking. Let's see how funny she finds prison. I'm here for Elias. Am I walking too fast? I know how miserable it feels to always walk behind. Are you worried about the grocer? Scared for your mom? Don't worry. They won't bother her. It's my number they'll trace. Your mom has nothing to fear. I promise. Look what I have. How about a water bomb? Good. Bravo! That was wonderful. You've progressed a lot. - Isn't my son talented? - Absolutely. You mentioned he had a cousin interested in lessons. Is he still interested? - Do you remember? - That was my nephew. They moved to Germany. He's in the conservatory. I told my husband we should go too. Our son should be in Europe. There's no future here. Right? What's your opinion? PUBLIC BATHS Hold me right, stupid. There she is, get ready. Hands in place! She's got hot legs... Those thighs! That ass! Jerk off! Those tits... Good enough to eat. Those tits... I want to lick them. Stop it, assholes! That's my sister! Fuck off! You bastards! What's your problem? Son of a bitch! Listen... I have this friend and he's really shy. Can you cheer him up? Is he paying? Put it on my account. Sorry! I'm really sorry. - You know Sara is... - Pregnant. Please don't tell her. It could hurt the baby. Don't worry. I'm deeply indebted to you. If ever you need anything, just ask. Mom, it's Donya. Hello, dear. How are you? Fine and you? How's Father? He can't stay in the hospital. It's expensive. Mom, my credit's almost gone. The call will be cut. When are you coming...? - Hello? - Hi, it's me. Hi. Everything alright? Yes, everything's fine. - Be on time. - OK. - Your documents are ready. - Thanks. I'll be happy to see you. Goodbye. Listen, I'm gay. Hello? - Am I disturbing you? - No, it's OK. - What? - You have time tomorrow? Why? What's up? - It's about your money problems. - OK, great. See you tomorrow. Sure this will work? - Hello. - Hello. How are you? My friend Babak needs a loan. I'm sure you can help him. My pleasure. - Are you employed? - Just a student. No problem. We'll manage. Do you have any collateral? Maybe a property deed? Nothing. It can be a photocopy. For the file. Where do we get it? This guy can help. Come back with the documents. Thank you. Goodbye. That's done. Should we go meet that guy? I need to tell you about this operation. The friend I'm helping isn't sick. She needs a virginity restoration. She's getting married. Oh, that kind of operation. An expensive date. You're cool to not abandon her. Thanks. - Bye. - Bye. Any news about that phone call? Not yet, dear. It won't be long. That tramp must pack up and go. - Ahmad, you're back. - Yes, thank God. How's your daughter? Better. They removed the stomach tumor. May God heal her. Goodbye. By the way, Sara... My nephew Yusef said everyone treated him kindly. Especially you. I'm sure you heard about the phone call. I hate to bother you... Sorry, I'm in a hurry. Goodbye. Fine. See you soon. Other schools allow late enrollment. I don't understand your attitude. How can I convince you? Don't waste your time. Bring your husbands signature. Stupid bitch! - Hello, Sara. - Where are you going? Get in. Thanks. Get in, sweetie. I have an appointment. A few blocks from here. Sorry about the other night. I drank too much. But it was fun. JANITOR How's your father-in-law? Not good. They might amputate his toe. Poor man. What do you know about drugs? Drugs? Their effects. Your husband? For example. That's easy: Slap him. If he doesn't react, it's opium. If he laughs, it's weed. If he jumps, it's hash. If it's crystal meth, he'll drop dead soon. If it's cocaine, he'll smother you with kisses. If he's insulting, then he's drunk. If he smacks you so hard you lose a tooth... everything's normal. He's sober. Is Elias staying with me? Do you have any siblings? Yes, two sisters and a brother. A big family. They still live in our province. I'm the only one who left. Turn right up there. The next left. We're almost there. You can let us out over there. There, near that couple. Thank you. Here we are. Thanks again, Sara, for the kindness. Her again! Be good, Elias. Bye. Hello. Shall we go? We're looking for Mr. Saleh? - Who? - Mr. Saleh! He just went out. Go inside. He'll be back. Have a seat. Why did you let them in? I'll get hanged because of them! Leave. Get out. Tell her I won't do it again. Who are you talking about? Tell who? That woman who dropped you off. I could have been hanged for her second abortion. No more fake mandates for sluts. People fuck but don't want babies. I'm not a murderer. Now go! We're not here about an abortion. We need a document. I see. Have a seat. What do you need? A photocopy of a title or a property deed. No problem. I'll prepare it right away. Same story every time. People dream of big weddings. They get a loan, then they end up drowning in debt. It's better to buy a passport and get out of here. What the hell can you do here? At most, you'll end up like me. Open your eyes. Don't be foolish. - W hen will you get the money? - I'm heading for the bank. - When's the operation? - Tomorrow at noon. See you tomorrow. I wouldn't want to be in her shoes. And even less in yours. I feel for you both. I'm going to castrate myself when this is over. The basic male problem. ISLAMIC REVOLUTIONARY COURT ISLAMIC REVOLUTIONARY COURT - You can go. - Thank you, Your Honor. Hello, dear. Hello, ma'am. You brought all the documents? - Don't start! - That bitch is messing with me. What bitch are you talking about? That headmistress. She won't enroll Elias. Call first. Don't come here in a fury! - Hello? - I'm calling from Court. This is Judge Adel. I received a complaint. You refused to enroll an innocent child. You should be aware that our religious values don't allow depriving a child of education. This is unacceptable! It's a misunderstanding, Your Honor. Tell me the child's name. I'll take care of it immediately. I'll send a fax. If I ever hear of the slightest violation, I'll have you fired without hesitation. Thank you, Your Honor. May God bless you. I got you, mangy beast! One of the kittens ran off. Where are you going so late? Ahmad promised to get rid of these cats. Leave those poor cats alone! For goodness' sake! One day, a mullah was approached by his neighbor: "I saw your daughter's round belly. Is she pregnant?" "No, it's just ﬂatulence." Months later, the neighbor tells him, "I saw your daughter holding her little fart." Just a little fart. A little fart is all it takes to ruin a lifelong reputation. The doctor says my unwed daughter is pregnant. God help me. Where will I find the money to abort the little bastard? I wish I was you. - Good evening. - It's very late, Ahmad. Sorry. How are you? Fine, thanks. How's your daughter? Her medical costs are very expensive. You know my circumstances. I'm a poor man. I was hoping you could help me get a little loan. You know nothing can be done without collateral. Good night. Mr. Mohsen... You heard about that phone call? The one to my nephew Yusef. Our neighbor works for the Morality Police. He could burn down the whore's house, if I give him her number. It's in your hands. Good night. 0912586734 What's happening? Another execution. A hanging? Once there was a man on the gallows who had no last words. But after they hoisted him up, he changed his mind. Back down, he declared, "I saw an illegal satellite dish on that rooftop!" So what's the photo for? A souvenir. Let's use a bright background. No, don't change it. Leave it. A little smile? No. Isn't that your number? Answer me! It wasn't me. I can't believe I've been living with a whore for the past five years. What other lies have you told me? Is that baby even mine? Who else did you sleep with? The butcher? The grocer? Taxi drivers? The neighbors? Go on, tell me the truth. That's right. I slept with the butcher, grocer, everyone, and I'm proud of it! You want details? And I had an abortion. Twice! Pack your things and get the hell out. Here. Do you have the money? Babak has it. Don't worry. He's on his way. What time is he coming, the guy with the money? Where could he be? Why isn't he here? - Sure he found the money? - Yes. Maybe he overslept. Get up. We'll go find him and come back. It's always the same. You owe me for the disinfectant. You haven't disinfected anything! Hi, is Babak here? What a world. Just because an idiot wants a virgin. Can a guy like that make you happy? What now? Will your fiancé go after him? There's no fiancé. So what's with all the drama? A trafficker. He takes girls to Dubai. He said the Arabs pay fortunes for Iranian virgins. I told him I was a virgin. He made me sign a contract. He took my passport. I'm trapped. But why? Your family knows? I haven't seen them in six months. I came to Tehran to find work. It's not much. It's enough for a ticket back home. Things will work out. You again, son of a bitch! Elias, have you seen Sara? Grandpa is in the hospital. They amputated his toe. That tramp must pack up and go. That tramp must pack up and go. It's good that you're here. Tell me which one suits me better. This one or this one? Have you heard? They discovered who phoned Yusef. JANITOR I have an idea! We'll prove to them that I'm an innocent angel. An angel would never phone Yusef. Here. Push the button when I tell you. OK? You're a good boy. Now! Don't look surprised. All angels have wings. Go ahead. Come on! Come on! The butcher? The grocer? Taxi drivers? The neighbors? Go show everyone. The baker, the butcher, the neighbors. Taxi drivers, everyone... Show them. Go, I said. Here's your schoolbag. I packed you a sandwich, a snack for break time. We must wake up very early tomorrow. School starts at 7:00. You don't want to be late on your first day. Are you excited?
