So, I did this intel gig with quadrant 54 for about 30 Gs, right? Hotshot senator who was bribed to rig the bills to get the water privatized, for a quick sell with Ductin Waterworks. So, the guarantee that the guy didn't flip to the competition, I was sent in to get these photos of this guy's private sex life. Real hush-hush stuff, right? This cat's got some fuckin' gnarly fetishes, especially when he'd binge on his weekend blow fest. So, I show up at this posh hotel, had to take out his guards, about to pop these pictures, right? I ambush the door to take these pictures, the guy's got some dude with him, naked. And he's wearing fake tits. But get this, the guy's got two dicks. How? Plastic surgery or some shit. I don't know, can you fucking believe it? Two dicks! Shit! Hold on, hold on. This is unit seven. Copy! Sector 56 off the bridge point boat near the testing facility. - How many? - Four! Transponder spotlight, lost contact about 30 minutes ago. Has the area been secured? That's a negative. No units in the perimeter. Satellites confirm the scene's clear. No hostiles. Copy nine three, we're on it. No, no, no, no. They're supposed to send in their own grunts before anyone does a sweep. It is what it is. At least the money is decent, right? Not everything is about the money, Brokowski. Okay, looks like it's just up about four clicks. Fucking bloodbath. Check out the town unit. Yo! Got another one. Holy shit! yeah? You see this? Oxford? Gates. All right, a scanner. We need semantics, a very good manual. I'm gonna check out the compound. What the fuck! Cross! Cross, I got something here, man. What was that, Brokowski? I found something man. Holy shit! It's a goddam setup. What do you mean it's a setup? Let's get the fuck out here. Oh shit. Brokowski! Easy, easy, easy, easy! Oh fuck! Easy, easy, you're gonna be okay. What the fuck! This is unit seven. We need immediate evac, please copy. I bet you've seen the light for the town. Maybe it's... Focus on me, focus. Easy, you're gonna be all right. No, no, no, no, no. Don't you fucking die on me, Brokowski. This is unit seven. I have a man down, I need immediate evac, please copy. Fuck! You're low balling the deal we originally discussed, Brightmore. This is shit! It clearly states in their contract, prior to any investigation, that all locations examined are to be reasonably secure. They did the investigation. They felt like the situation was reasonably secured. A few thermal readouts and some photos? Given the circumstances. Secure, let's define that, shall we? That means securing by physical force. Applicable in clause 9.5 under security provisions. In this case, no physical force was applied, only risk assessment. There was no need to send in ground units. Compromising my client's ability to do his job. Nothing in that contract states that a physical person had to be on site to secure the area. Does it say that? What about the inconsistencies in his account of the events? Someone, whom you can't recall, attacked you and your colleague. You experienced high-pitched sounds and migraines. Did I miss anything? Mr. Frost, our video logs show no suspects. - Your colleague... - My friend! Was trying to remove a media device. Your friend accidentally ignited an explosive that was attached to an armored belt from one of the victims. I'd say that places the error on him, wouldn't you? That is not what happened. According James Sox video logs, it is. If there was actual security, none of this would have happened. If you are not happy with the settlement that C & Earth gave you, you are more than welcome to start a fistfight with the largest conglomerate in the world. I mean, what Hollister, you think your client's special? We hire adjusters and freelancers like him on a weekly basis, in operations all over the Mid-East. Shit happens! They know what they're getting into, right? All right, I'm fully aware what kinda business you're running here. Are you making a threat? An observation. May I remind you, Mr. Frost, the weight of your nondisclosure agreement? - What, son of a bitch. - Hey Mark, wait. - Mark, wait. - This is fucking bullshit. They are lying. I know what I saw. Mark, I've seen the footage too. And they're manipulating it. You have no proof of that. Fred, I'm not crazy. I know you're not. Sorry, I couldn't pull it off. Yeah, there's no... No sense trying to reason with someone that covers up facts. Fucking pricks! So, what are you gonna do now? I'm gonna figure it out. Hey, thanks for being here. Of course! Hey, Mark! Be careful. It's been slow. I didn't really realize that it was gonna be so difficult to take care of mom's house by myself but, I've done a couple of sculptures, so we will see. You know, if you're strapped, you can always work here. I appreciate it, but I'm good. Ladybug! Watch out, honey. So, I did one of those random questionnaires online. Just asked me thoughts I have about things. Movies, music, favorite colors... I do those all the time. So, this one paid me $300. Wow! I mean, I think I did one last month and I got a gift card. Oh, sorry! This is so beautiful. You can have it. It's a hosta ria. Thanks, sis. What about me? You can have this one. It's a cabana plant. - What do you say? - Thank you, Aunt Lizzy. You are welcome. Do you want me to take it? - Uh huh! - Thank you, honey. So, how's Paul? Paul is good. He's out making his routine rounds. Hey, Sheriff! Wilson here. Copy, Wilson. The herd's out again on Sycamore, and they're blocking traffic. They're shitting everywhere. Well then, fix it. Sir, I don't know anything about cows. Go ahead and call Brigman at the ranch. He's got 'em tagged, he'll help you with it. Should I cite him? No, Wilson. You don't gotta cite for every little thing. Just go ahead and give the guy a hand, all right? Copy that, sir. Sounds good. I'll get that for you, right away. Oh, Hey Sheriff. Hey, Connie. One sec, I'll get you a coffee. No rush. Hey David, how are you doing? Here you go, Sheriff. Well, thank you, Connie. Of course, yeah. Got you slaving away, huh? Double shifts. I guess my scholarship doesn't cover books or lab. Oh hey, Connie, can I get some more coffee please? Yeah. - I'll be right with you. - Thank you. Have a good one, Sheriff. Have a nice day. Trevor! Sheriff, how are you doing? New toy? Oh yeah. Finally got rid of that old shit box I was driving. Yes, you did. Big payday or something. No, I got rid of the house up on Briar. Just called the escrow yesterday. Who's the buyer? Some guy. Doesn't speak much. Paid for the whole thing in cash. Don't you have that town meeting this morning? Shit, I do. Thanks, Trevor. See you later. - David. - Thank you. Okay, easy, easy. Whoa, let me talk. All of you, I assure you, everything's fine. It's just a matter of how they're gonna do the payouts. All we need you to do is get in a line in the hallway by the table. We'll go through each contract one at a time. So, let's do that, all right? Come on! Thank you. Sorry I'm late. We're good. What else was there to discuss really? So, what's the hold up? Legal bullshit. It takes weeks to get through 10 pages. Yeah, things are gonna change around here once Peredor develops all this land. Town's gonna grow from 800 to 8000 if you just watch and listen here. Yeah. People around here aren't fond of change, especially a corporate expansion. Know what I'm saying? Yeah, but I know another thing they're not very fond of. And what's that? Poverty. Of course. You're right there. But you know what scares me about this whole thing? What? The people doing the deal. Have a little faith, Sheriff. Got this? I've slaughtered multinational corporations and teamsters unions. Relax! Hi! Can I help you? I'm here about the order. Yes. Mr. Renate, right? - Yeah, that's me. - Okay. 3535 Briar Road. Oh, you live up there? Yeah, I just moved in. Oh, it's so nice. That place was on the market for like five years. I got lucky. Is this your business? Yep, from the ground up. All right, your tally is $15354.56. And we take everything, card, cheque, money order, - wire transfer. - Hello. Looks like Stetson's gonna close the deal. I'm assuming cash is okay? Yes, cash is perfectly fine. Thank you. And then just... It's a lot of cash. Yeah, Mr. Renate just bought that house up on Briar Road. Oh, okay! You're the guy. Yeah, I'm the guy. You're always paying cash like that? I'm old school. That's what customers do, honey. You're right, honey. I was just wondering if there was a story. So, what's your story? Used to do homicide and other things. Used to, and other things? Yeah, I'm retired. So you moved out here all by yourself? Don't have any family? No, just me. I guess we're done here, right? Yes, yes we are. And then I'll have this sent out to your house. Okay. Probably tomorrow. You know it's a tight-knit little town. Very tight. What do you think, honey? Should we invite him over for dinner? Why not? Nah, it's okay. I'm a little busy up at the house. And I have all these plants to deal... Nonsense! Besides we really like meeting new people. So, if you could come over like tomorrow at 5:30, unless that's too soon. No, I think I can make that work. Great. What the hell! Hello! Who's there? - Hey, Teague. - Sheriff. - Where's Connie? - No clue. Tried her home, her cell. She ever been late? That young lady defines the word punctuality. Dude, this easy. Oh gosh! Oh, you're too slow, son. Go get it, hobo. Postmortem, maybe 18 hours. The neck line appears to be sliced open manually. Wait! So you're telling me somebody slit her throat open with their bare hands. Yes! Look at the angle of the lacerations. There's also a burn mark on the cornea. The inner hairs ruptured. Her eyelashes are also singed. How is that? Something burned the entire eye. Not enough to burn through the tissue, just enough to destroy the cornea. What would do that? You tell me. I've never seen anything like this. That doesn't make any sense. Everything looks pristine. Yeah, the only tracks I found were from the kids. Yeah, I'm okay. You sure you're all right, Wilson? Yeah! Reasonor. It's a long trek for an errand, Mark. It's a satellite dead zone, come on. Word on the street is that you're no longer in the game. Yeah, that's right. Where's my merchandise? I had to kick open a lot of unfriendly doors. What's that all about anyway? The world has its secrets, Mark. Secrets everyone wants to know. Wants to keep. Maybe you should ask your friends over in C & Earth. That's just it, I can't. Strange things have been happening over there. Information's been tight. Figured if they can't carve out a slice of the pie for me, might as well go straight to the source. Well, I appreciate your service, Reasonor. C & Earth doesn't like inquisitors, Mark. Be careful looking out into the sun. You might go blind. Like the hair. There we are. Oh no, no, no, no. Fuck! God dammit! He what? No, no, no, no, no, no! Brett, you know me. Listen to me. I'm asking for some help here. Okay, that's it. If it was the other... I understand. I do. No backup, huh? Unless it's a state emergency, we're on our own. I overheard you say something about the mayor. That son of a bitch! He called state. He called state and told them we had it all under control. Sheriff, I know I don't have a lot of experience but I did go to the academy. I'm sorry, Wilson, it's not personal. It's fine. I'm just saying, whatever you need, I'm sure I can handle it, sir. And I appreciate it. It's nothing. Fucking locals. Hey, Mark. - Hi. - How are you? I'm okay. I made this, brought that. Thank you. That's very nice. Paul's not here yet, but please come in. Mark, this is my sister, Jenny. Hi, Mark. Hi. Nice to meet you. So, you just moved here? Yeah, yeah! Couple of days ago, yeah. Jenny actually lives down the road from you. Oh! And she's single too. Liz, why do you always have to do that? 'cause I love you so much. Sorry, my sister is dealing with this Tourette's thing. It's hereditary. Would you like something to drink? Some water is fine. Alrighty, good stuff. So, Liz said you retired? Yeah! Jesus, Paul! You scared me. How long have you been standing there? What's wrong, honey. I feel like you've given me a handicapped spoon. You have to do it with more finesse. Wait! Watch! - Hi guys. - Hi Paul. I'm sorry to keep you guys waiting. Are you okay? No! No, I'm not. Connie Hendricks. She was murdered. Oh my God! Do you have any leads? No, we start our investigation. What did the forensic report say? Excuse me! I'm sorry, I'm out of line, just habit. No, Mark, that's okay. Yeah Mark, it's okay. I'm intrigued. Honey, you're tired, it's hot, just leave it alone. No, Liz, I am intrigued. Comes into town out of nowhere, pays in cash for everything. Doesn't sound strange to you? Kinda strange, don't you think? Jenny, don't you think it's kinda strange? Or is it just me? He used to work homicide and other things? What are the other things, Mark? Yeah, for all I know, Jenny, he could be an ice dealer. Are you an ice dealer, Mark? That's enough. Liz, hell, he could be a goddam suspect. I said, that's enough. I think I should get going. Why Mark? Where are you going? Liz, I really appreciate the invite, thank you. You don't gotta go, Mark. Jenny, nice to meet you. It was very nice to meet you. Good luck. - I love you so much. - I love you too, sis. When are you gonna come to the store and check out my paintings? I have put up new ones. Probably not till Tuesday. 'cause I have a lot of work to do. Okay. Thank you for dinner. You're welcome. Bye, Paul. Goodnight! Goodnight, Jenny. You wanna talk about it? Not really. I know you're angry and you're emotional, but we invited that man over for dinner. And the way we treated him, that's not acceptable. I know. I should have listened to y'all. And I just hadn't seen anything like that since Chicago. Hi there, what can I get you? Bourbon, neat. So you heard? What? There you are. About the murder. It has to do with me how? Forget it. So, deal's almost done. Three more signatures. I'll have new contract files for you tomorrow night. Just email me what you got. No! You put 'em on the hard drive that I gave you. Frank, okay. Forgot about that. You haven't plugged that in anywhere other than your own terminal, have you? No! All right, Jesus. No, it's not all right. You know, in seventh grade, we had a science fair. It was a chain reaction competition thing. The idea was to create this domino effect, with a bunch of stuff to let a hamster out of a cage at the end of a sequence. So, I created this elaborate setup with mouse traps, water balloons, matches, bunsen burners, track all kinds of crap. But there is this one spot. I always got hung up on a paper clip. Right by where the cage was, and the entire effect would completely fall apart. Poor little shit couldn't get out. I'm creating an entire universe to free this hamster. And a goddam paper clip keeps ruining it. Don't be the fucking paper clip, Stetson. Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait. Stetson! What's goin' on? That's sure grieving over your wife. What was it, cancer? Are you judging me, Stetson? Why did you cut me out of that little deal of yours? Because you're not a very reliable guy. You're mayor, okay. Oh, oh, by the way, congratulations on that property. It's gonna be kinda tough selling anything else, isn't it? It's gonna be tough getting elected next year, isn't it? I'll be a goddam hero. Come on, let's go honey. Oh, let me see your driver's license. What the hell is that? Oh, some stupid online test I took. I'm amazed I even got anything from it. Let's see, what have we got here? What? You look like a dirty old perv. Thank you very much, give me that. Hey big man, at least you're my dirty old pervert. Hold up, hold up. Hey, I'm a fireball, okay? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Worked every light. Rocky, I got at least another hour, huh? Sorry babe, I guess we gotta go to another place. Babe... Jackie, where'd you go? Jack! What's goin' on? What are you doin? What the fuck! Oh, hey Sheriff. Yeah! I'm getting all kinds of calls about that situation, yesterday. And what did you tell 'em? That it's under investigation. There's no cause for immediate concern. We have yet to determine anything at this time. That's perfect! Keep telling them that. Classified! Sheriff. Copy. Yeah, I'm over at the victim's house and the only prints I could find were the victim's. There was nothing in the house either except the mother's. You're sure there's nothing else? Picked up a couple of unusual fibers, some black ones in the living room. But, still gonna keep looking. What about witnesses? I checked her work, no leads, but I still have a few more people to talk to. All right. Come back when you're done and we'll log it. All right, copy that. Is that it? No, I found these. Size 15 dress shoe. Could be work shoes from the cable guy. No, no. What about the box? Could be from the area company. No company named or serial number? Could be reaching here. Log it anyway. All right. Witnesses? Nothing. She left work, end of story. And believe me, I asked everyone. All right. It's getting kinda late. Why don't you go home and get some rest. Okay, I'll see you tomorrow. - Hey, Wilson. - Yeah! Good work. Thanks. Good evening, Mr. Graham. Status report. The property values hold a much higher yield by year three. The contract's equitable and the project's already underway. Encountered a few minor issues but nothing we can't handle. Please keep us updated on the situation with the local police. Containment is everything. It's my pleasure, collective. Let me know if there's anything else I can assist with. Not at this time. We will keep you apprised, if there are any new developments. In the interim, project initiatives remain. That is all. Appreciate the precaution. My employers don't take kindly to insiders. Understood. Do you have the first installment? Yeah. How do we know you can deliver the goods? I'm working on it. Remember, there are no guarantees. Can't you just lift it from their facility? It's impossible. They'd know it was me. Looks good. When I get back, you'll get what you've asked for, as long as we agree on the final price. Sheriff! Mark! Can I help you? Nice place. Yeah, it's coming. I want to apologize. I was a real asshole. Had a shit day. It's all right. Tell me the truth, your wife send you? She wasn't very happy with me. You know, I could use a break. You want some water, ice tea or something? Here you go. - That work? - Yeah, thank you. So, why move here? Let's say I wanted to escape the noise. Well, plus, what my place went for in the city, down here it was five times a yield. So, it was kind of a no-brainer. You ain't gotta tell me, buddy. That's why we moved out here too. I used to work vice, Chicago, once upon a time. Looked up your files. You weren't lying about your experience. Changed your name to Renate. Also found a file, classified. What's that all about? Well, I guess it's classified, isn't it? Right. Well, thanks for the drink. Maybe after this whole case thing is solved, we can try the dinner thing again. Yeah, Sheriff, how is that coming along anyway? It's coming. Amy, please be careful. Hi, Mr. Booboo. Please be nice to Cynthia, okay? Amy honey, it's time for bed. Boo! Oh, you scared me. Where did you get that? In the bushes. Oh. Okay well, go upstairs and brush your teeth and get ready for bed, okay? Momma's gonna drop you off a little bit early tomorrow. Mommy, can you leave the light on? We need to save money on our electric bill. And you would never go to sleep. Besides, darkness isn't always a bad thing. Sometimes it can be a really good thing. Why? Because, it helps us dream. I know you like to dream. And it tells our bodies when we're supposed to go to sleep. Believe it or not, not everything scary is in the darkness. Sometimes, the scariest things are right out in the open, right in front of us. That's why it's so important to be brave. Crazy, huh? - Yeah! - Yeah. All right, little munchkin. Let's get you into bed, okay. I love you. Sweet dreams, and if you need anything, I'll be right around the corner, okay? Okay, love you mommy. Okay, can I get some kisses? Is that a cavity? It's a cavity. Nurse, can you bring me my pliers? Well, hasn't this gone far enough? Fuck it, I'll do it myself. No, no, no, no all right I'll tell you. I'll tell you. Mommy! No, no! No. - Sheriff. - Mark. What's going on? I found another victim. Oh no! Sorry! You don't think it was me, do you? No! I put a call into state. They said they were a little stretched, but I need you to see this. Sure, yeah. Let me just change. Come on. Did you get enough photos? Yeah. Did you tell Liz? No. Not yet. Stay off the radio. - Okay. - She might be listening. Dr. Hanning. This is Mark. He'll be helping us with the investigation. Can you bag this? Where's Amy? She's in the other room. She won't talk to anyone. You have two. Two perps. Two? Very tall and very strong. First perp, pinned by her throat against this wall. She retaliated with the vase. She fell and she crawled. She was intercepted by the second perp. Now, perp two lifted her up, did something to her eye and crashed her neck with one hand. They were interrupted because they got out of here in a hurry. Yeah, apparently. The neighbor, she came over when she heard some strange noises. What's your theory for the eye? The eye is... They placed some sort of object over the eye with a heat source. You see the burn marks on the cornea? I saw that with the other victim. Ever come across something like that? Yeah. It's pretty advanced RND stuff. Not something you find everyday, huh? No. She told me she was an artist. Yeah. Yeah, it was mostly paintings, sculptures. Mostly stuff that they sell to tourists over at the gallery on Talon. What about this stuff? Was any of this hers? Yeah. Pretty much everything in here is. She's talented. What about the other victim? Connie? Yeah, she was a student. She was working on her degree in the University of Westerville. What was she studying? Biochemistry or something, why? They're really particular about their target. It's why Amy lived. She wasn't on their list. How do you figure? Because she'd be lying right here next to her. Whatever reason, they were only interested in the mother. Sheriff, they were really clean about this whole thing. I couldn't find any prints. We're gonna have to speak to Amy. Hi, sweetheart. This is my friend, Mark. He's gonna ask you a few questions, okay? Yes! Remember that time we had dinner with Mr. Salamander? Wasn't he nice? Amy. It was tea. It was tea and cupcakes, remember? Amy, my name's Mark. Is it okay if I sit here and ask you a couple of questions? Let me borrow your other flashlight. She's partially blind on this eye? No! Do you want some tea with Mr. Salamander? I would love some tea. Maybe after we're done, okay. Amy, do you think you can tell me who was here today with your mom? There were two people, right? There were many. They want to see. What do they wanna see? Tea, cupcakes, friends, walks in the field, riding my bike, they want to see. Do you think you can tell me what they look like? Mr. Salamander, would you like some tea? All right kiddo. I'll meet you at the hospital right now, okay? Your Aunt Lizzy and I are gonna come by and see you in a little while. I need a hug. Take care of her. Hey! You all right? Yeah, I'm, yeah. I really appreciate you doing all this. Don't mention it. I think it would help to see the rest of those case files. Sure thing. What do you think she meant by, they want to see. Could be anything. She could have dissociated, found an imaginary friend, like a protector. Its common, we see that a lot with people that experience trauma, especially kids. Seemed like you thought it was something else. No, it's nothing. It's nothing, that's bullshit. I just don't like to jump to conclusions. Okay! Okay! So then, what were you thinking? Hey, that's my goddam niece right there. And I'm gonna find out who did this. I'm going after who did this. So, I need to know where you're coming from. Or we can't help each other here. So, let's start with, what's in those classified files? I worked homicide for five years and I got bugged out and quit. So, I traveled. I took a job with the military. I got offered a gig doing black operations. It's like dark market shit. I had no idea what I was getting into till I saw the paycheck. Paycheck and the look on their faces when I joined. I bet. You know, a lot of guys, they don't give a shit. It's good money. I thought I'd seen corruption. Nothing like this. This was unlike anything I'd seen, it was unreal. Some of these businesses, fucking ruthless. I realized, war isn't an ideology. It's a business. It's weapons sales and corporate acquisitions. That's the game they play. We were just pawns. Is that why you bailed? I barely remember. I get these flashes but it... But what? We weren't supposed to go in until this area was locked down. They sent us in anyway. They said it was clear based off some goddam satellite images. There was someone down there. I don't know who it was but, it killed my friend. What do you mean it? Whatever caused that mayhem, but there was no way it was human. I'm gonna help you find these people, I give you my word. I'm really sorry about this. Me too. Oh my God, Paul. I have been calling and texting you. I know. What's going on? It's Jenny. I know it's Jenny. I've been listening to the police scanners and she's not answering her phone. Jenny... What? Jenny what? Don't. - No! - Liz, Liz. Liz. I'm sorry. Jesus! Are you gonna move? Move out of the way. What are you doing? You wanna play? We'll play. Turn around, put your hands on the vehicle. Now! Get off of me. Little girl's over at Talon Community. Well, it's gonna be a long night. Graveyard, huh? I'm the only one here. Okay. We're gonna put her over here and head out. Thanks guys. Damn! You scared me. What are you doing here? Hey, Teague. Where's everybody? You tell me. Haven't see anybody at all? Just some truckers from the moving company in Howard. So, unfortunately my equipment, I didn't pick up any DNA or prints but, I was able to analyze that thread we found. Electric nano carbon fiber. What's that? It's a microscopic fiber that creates electricity when it's shaken, in clothing made of this stuff, can charge a tablet, phone, all sorts of stuff. What's interesting, outer layer is laced with Kevlar. Well, is that common? In theory. In the real world, we're still 12 years away from this. You know, Wilson found some black thread at Connie's house. Which reminds me. Hey, Terry! Have you heard from Wilson? No sir. What about Hanning? She drop off the reports? No, sir. I haven't heard from her either. God dammit, everyone go AWOL today? Wilson! Can you copy? Wilson, do you copy? By the way, Wilson found these at the victim's homes. Wilson, do you copy. God dammit. Hey Wilson, it's Paul. Can you please call back? Also, check in with dispatch. I think you're on the wrong channel again. Sheriff, these are splitter drives. They hijack internet, phone, really any signal within a two-mile radius. And these things can shut down power lines if the wrong person has 'em. They're like nearly impossible to hack. You need some sort of special equipment just to get access. They can't be hacked? Anything can be hacked. So, who around here would have access to something like this? Someone with deep pockets and access to classified RND. You know, I saw some guys out on Sycamore a couple of days ago. They were installing something on those communication lines. We should check those out. Why don't I go follow up with my deputy, track him down. You check on the black boxes. Cool. - All right. - Sheriff! Mayor. Tragic, huh, that incident last night? What the hell do you want? Just curious to meet this PI you've been talking so much about. So, is it Mark Renate? Or Frost? Isn't surveillance a little above your pay grade, Mayor? That's rich, son. Coming from your line of work. So Sheriff, what's the story here? We've got our leads, Mayor. Okay. - Yeah. - Well, I hope you're keeping it on the DL. Graham is closing the last contract right now. One more day and the sun will rise from it's sunken shit hole to richer prospects. So, you're working with Peredor Corporation? No, I'm just cashflow in the town, that's all. That wouldn't involve any kickbacks now, would it? I don't know. That would be illegal. All right, I'm sure you'll do just fine in the trade lines. I'm just doing my job, son. Always a pleasure to see you, Sheriff. Now, don't make a mess of things, okay? You boys have a good day now. You two are all packed and ready to go, right? Yes, sir. What about the others? They, already gone. So, we just leave, right? Correct. - Well, what if... - You sold your property and you moved, understand? - Do you understand? - Yes, yes. Good. When the time comes, we will tell you what to say and when to say it. You will receive a wire for the purchase amount of your property, in full, within three days, and a bonus for your troubles. Have a safe trip. Sorry I'm late. Fucking tractor. So, that was the last one? Yes. Why are you here? I'm getting a little nervous. They got that private dick snooping around. It's all under control. You don't know that. Just play the game, Stetson. You said nobody gets hurt. Keep running that mouth of yours. I assure you that will change. Stick to the plan. Stop being such a pussy, Stetson. God dammit. Fuck in a pee pee sheets. Yeah, Mark. Guess what? I found one of those black boxes. I'll swing by my place, see what I can make of it. What's the story with this warehouse compound out by the 43 overpass. I mean, the mayor and Graham were setting up all kinds of things with Peredor's contractors. It could be one of their facilities, housing utility equipment. And the mayor is being kind of elusive about the whole thing. Well, I think I'm gonna swing by his place first. Where does he live? Hi honey. No, I didn't go to work today. I can't believe she's gone. Have you found anything new in the case? Find this guy, Paul. I love you too. Bye. Hey, Wilson. Hey Wilson, it's Paul. Yeah! No, I have no idea where he is. His truck's here. His car's not. What? You're cutting out, Mark. Mark! Shit! Prick! I'm gonna need a faster car. There we go. There we go. Bingo! What the fuck! Frost! Reasonor. I can explain. You'll lose the piece first. No. You wanna search me? What are you doing here? Few months ago, I had a gig. Technology hunt. Everybody wanted it. Went by the nickname, Dream Catcher. Okay, what is it? I don't know. C & Earth funded the project. Don't bullshit me, Reasonor. I'm not. I have something that I think you'll be interested in. See this? This girl was found in another small town, Bigsby. It's a lot like Sullen, just 300 miles north of here. And this girl, she's still alive. Can't remember anything, except her name, her job and her ID number. These are all cold cases, all just swept under the rug, complements of the C & Earth Corporation. Yeah, they're targeting specific people in town. They bought everyone in the town. It's almost like a... It's like a quarantine. Sheriff to dispatch. Sheriff to dispatch, Terry! You know, I never got, what's your angle on all this? Tech's worth a lot. Good luck. You know, whoever's using it, they cut up throats with their bare hands. If I were you, I'd just check out. Where do I go, Reasonor? Done this fucking thing. You need my help. Your help? Yeah, and I want something in return. There's the problem. If we end up killing one of these things, I want the tech. Be my guest. You can use it as a vibrator for all I care. Oh, I don't need any toys. Terry! This is sector 121, grid 23, Sullen Station. Calling grid 23 main patrol. We have an 1199, requesting backup, do you copy, over. This is Sheriff Culvan, requesting 1199 immediate backup. Do you copy? Over. God dammit. Station's empty. The radio is down, phone lines are down, I can't even get a signal on my cellphone. Who are you? Extra hand. Just trust me. I found a car at the general store. There was nobody around but it was a bloody mess. Can't find Wilson anywhere either. What the hell's going on? Those two-way radios, you got 'em? Inside. So, they wired this whole town. Who? The C & earth Corporation. Mark, who is she? I'm standing right here, asshole. Oh, I see that. Then you can address me in the first. I'll address you however I feel like while you're in my station. Well, does your station provide due process services? Or do you just jail whoever you fucking feel like? Well, why don't I throw your ass in the tank and see how that feels. Oh, why don't you do that, sweetheart. Look, I don't know what you think you... Knock it off. I don't like cops. Bunch of fucking hypocrites. He's not like that, Reasonor. Get that gun off my throat, now! Whatever you say. I don't need this shit, Mark. She's valuable. She brought evidence linking murders from another town similar to the victims here. She's gonna help us, right? Hey, right Reasonor? Just stay on your side of the fence and I'll play nice. They have scramblers all over town. Now, I can bypass the signal if I can switch this frequency output. You gotta see this. Check that out. What am I looking for here? I hacked that black box, I found a list. Our two victims were on it. They use some sort of psych test across social networking sites. And they targeted a list of 35 people here in town. Peredor Corporation. Well, that's just a cover for C & Earth. So, I went over to the mayor's house and I found this list of their real estate contracts. Jesus! They paid all these people to leave town? Remember that tech we were talking about? Yeah! Yeah, the eye thing. It's some kinda device. Why would they do this? I don't know. Just keep that on that channel, okay? Yeah. Can we stop fucking with him? Well, what is this? What? This list, my wife's on this list. Spooky, spooky. Yeah, it's a lockdown. I'm gonna get Liz. and I'll go to two of 'em for some backup. Reasonor, you head with him, okay? No fucking way. You're out of your depth going solo. Yeah, she's right. Where are you going? Remember that compound I told you about? Yeah. Yeah, I'm gonna go there. What time is your flight? About three hours. You should have left yesterday. It'd be a better alibi. I had a situation to placate, okay? It's a damn excuse. Do you have the hard drive? Oh shit, I forgot. Who the fuck is that? It could be the Sheriff. No, I took care of that already. What do you mean you took care of it? Just get this door. Oh, Mr. and Mrs. Drummond. This is a surprise, what's the trouble? Mayor, what the hell's going on here? The power's out everywhere. We can't get a hold of anyone. Oh, you know probably just some trouble with the lines. What the fuck! She's just, man, she's just a kid. She's just a kid. Jesus Christ. What the fuck is wrong with you? Do you have any fucking idea who you're in bed with, Stetson? If I didn't take care of that, they were gonna take care of us. Now, go upstairs and get your fucking hard drive. Eagle one, I need a cleanup crew. Grid six, point 54, sector three. Looks like somebody grew a conscience. I was just doing what you told me. Bullshit. You're transferring files from that hard drive. What are you gonna do with that, Stetson? What do you think? Are you gonna turn whistleblower? Go to the media? Our media? I'm just trying to get some leverage. How do I know you're not gonna fuck me over? You're a real weak sister. I knew you were stupid. Wait, wait, look, look. Look at me. How about, we just start over with a clean slate, you and I? Sounds good. Careful, Reasonor. Don't worry about me. Liz! Are you in here? You go that way. I'll check over here. Liz! Liz! - Freeze. - Jesus, Paul. I'm sorry, sweetheart. - I'm so sorry. - You scared the shit out of... It's all right, it's all right, it's all right, it's all right. Who's that? She's here to help. Hey! We gotta go. I'll explain later. Come on. Fuck! You did this? No, you were the last one in. Shit! Please, do something. Move your head. Go, go, go! Shit! Go, go, go! Come on. Liz, are you okay? I'm okay. What the hell was that? What's going on? I don't know, Liz. I don't know but we're gonna go get help, okay? Just hang in there. You were right, Mark. We almost got killed too. We're heading out of town right now, we need some backup. I'm staying here, I'm gonna check something out. No, no, no, no, just wait till backup arrives. Mark. Stop the car. Turn off the headlights. It's a blockade. They've probably got every car leading up to this street blocked off. How do we get out of here? What about the trail? What trail? Clearview. The one through the mountain? I never thought you were stupid. Even with the stock C & Earth hooked us up with. They could burn the town for all I fucking care. Oh man, did you eat at the cafeteria? Why don't you have one of these protein shakes? I nearly shit in my pants. Did you enjoy the taste? Imprints of those who've lived and those who've passed? Where are they? Intra reverse, forged for a species that inhabited this planet long ago. Some of the DNA is not entirely of this world. When we acquire this solitary town, we allow them to go out and play. Some of the results were erratic but promising. You know my name? Of course. In the desert, you were part of a field test for a memory extraction. You were the target, and your counterparts were an obstacle. You challenged the interpreters. You were supposed to forget the incident entirely. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case. But the most unexpected side effect, was that you developed the sight? Didn't you notice that your lips are not moving? The flashbacks, the thoughts, visions of old and new, Mr. Frost. Along with your unique ability to hear us. Why are you doing this? Souls, Mr. Frost. They contain the pulse. The pulse sustains life, brings meaning, prolongs mortality. Without it, there is void, our collective fades, because they lack connection with the pulse. Life, merry, experience, creativity are all properties of the pulse. With this technology, we've been able to harness it, experience it, it expands their life force, gives them power, feeds their purpose and desire. You're a real fucking piece of work. Just the messenger. You're murdering innocent people. They're all expendable, and your interference has gone on far enough. We'd like to find out why you're hearing us. Perhaps through expression, we might find something to explain this anomaly. How dare you challenge the established order, Mr. Frost? How far is it, Liz? It's about 400 feet. What the fuck is that? Ram it. - What? - Just do it. What's happening? - EMP! - He's in the car. He's in the car. Get out of the car. Liz, let's go. Go, go, go, go, go. Go, go, go, go, go, go. Fuck! No. Go, go, get on the trail. Go, go, I'll hold him. Get down, get down. Go! Go, go, go! We have to stop. Where's Paul? Are you okay? Get back. Let's go. Lights, display. Call Councilor Graham. A bit messy. The collective knew that going in. Yes, they did. Fortunately for you, they were happy with the way you handled it. So, are we clean? Yes. You received payment? I did. We should do this more often. Graham, I personally wouldn't hire you to draw up an invoice for a garage sell. That's funny Brightmore. By the way, how's your wife? Tell her I said, "Hello." Asshole. Pleasure doing business with you. Collective, channel block 1.4 encrypted. Councilor Brightmore. We recovered three extractions out of 35. Operation was cleaned efficiently. How do you cover a story in? No issues. However, it will take some time to rebuild new prototypes in order to resume the assignment. Fortunately, with the real estate values, we're well into the black, and our losses overall were minimum. What about Mr. Frost? Still can't locate him. We should have paid him a higher settlement. We gave you the authority to pay him according to his wishes. - But I thought that... - But you decided to play hard ball. It doesn't matter at this point, but this does complicate things. I believe this was left for you. It's from Mr. Frost. Would you read it, please? We are not your property. Mr. Brightmore. Yes, Collective. Do you think Councilor Graham had any associations outside of our contractual arrangement? We can always look into it. Very well, Councilor Brightmore. The operation will continue upon the next available opportunity. Keep us apprised of any new developments. Meeting adjourned. Reasonor. Did you get your car back? Yes, I did. Had a couple of scratches on it but I'll live. You got the cash? Sent! And the catcher? Clever. Would have done this myself but C & Earth would have figured it out eventually. Oh, my competitors are gonna be very happy about this. Which competitors? Wouldn't you like to know. Besides, I thought you didn't like strings attached. I don't. Good. Are we done here? Yep. By the way, I heard you killed a little girl. Gunshot to the face, right? You didn't hear the news? Some psycho kid. Domestic terrorist or something. I had cameras put in the mayor's office, Graham. What can I say? You know, it's a really fucked up system. It's a real shit show. About as full of shit as that grin on your fucking face. That's funny. I don't get to make the rules, okay? You do what you can and just hope you don't up somebody's bitch. But there are rules, even in this ugly world that you just don't get to fucking break. Who the fuck are you to lecture me about ethics? This is business. Why don't you get out of here you fucking cunt? This is your ID, passport and birth certificate. Nisa? It's the best I could do. They think you're dead but you can't go back to Sullen. Remember, you are on C & Earth's list. I miss him. Here. It's an account number. Plenty of money on there, enough to get you back on your feet. I can't accept that. Please. Thank you. You know, the world, it has to change. I'll be in touch.
