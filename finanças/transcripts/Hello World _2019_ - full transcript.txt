"Kyoto, 2027" Here, in Kyoto City, Keito University and pluura are working together on a project to digitally preserve the city's detailed history. "Chronicle Kyoto" is underway. "Pedestrian Lane and Cycleway" Are we going for it? We'll make it. Run! Made it! Yes! Karaoke? In Kawaramachi? You wanna come? Hey. Sorry, uh... It's Katagaki. Right. Katagaki-kun. We're going to a get-together. - To karaoke. -Um...l... No problem if you have other plans. No, uh...yeah. Let's go! - Wait up! - You're late! - Sorry! - Hurry up. Have the others left already? Yeah. There'll be 30 of us. "Pedestrian Lane and Cycleway" "Train Yourself to Be More Decisive!" "Don't dwell on things." Make quick decisions. "BBQ meat bun" "Fish sandwich" You! What'll it be? "Twister roll" Twister, please. Twister roll! "Stop caring what others think." Speak your mind! - Which art class are you taking? - Calligraphy, maybe? My writing sucks... That's my seat. That's why you should take it. No, it really sucks. "Don't let others decide for you. Make decisions for yourself!" Next, library staff. Any bookworms? Katagaki? How about it? Um...l... I'll do it. OK, Katagaki. "Katagaki"? "Kata" as in hard... Oh, OK. Any girls? How about you, Ichigyo? Good for you. "Pedestrian Lane and Cycleway" "When in doubt, trust your instincts!" This isn't helpful at all. - Wow! - Which class is she in? She's like an idol. You went to Higashi Middle School. I lived near there. Let's start the meeting. "Library Staff Duties" Everyone gather 'round. Let's form a "Wiz" group to exchange information. Let's exchange info, Misuzu. Sure. - Me, too. - Yes! I'm In. - Got it! - Me, too. - Thanks, Misuzu. - Wait your turn! If you didn't join the group, find someone to exchange info with. That's it for today. Let's go. Let's get our bags, Maro. Ichigyo-san. Did you join the Wiz group? Will you...uh...exchange info with me? Do you have Wiz? If not, your cell phone number... Your profile in settings... You can find me here. A physical address...? "Minami Library, Kyoto City" "Reading Log 2027" The library will be closing at 4 pm today to take inventory. If you'd like to check out a book, please do so ten minutes before... I guess I'll read it at home. What's this? - Look at that. - Isn't that weird? - What is that? - A natural phenomenon? - Take a picture. - Let's post it on Wiz. A crow... Three legs? Hey! Wait! Where is it going? What is this? I'm in... I did it! I'm in! Finally! Success! Yes! But Fushimi Inari? It's a little off... l guess it still has glitches. Wait. If the location is off... Hey! What day is it? - The 16th... - Ah, he can't see me... Naomi Katagaki? Don't follow me! Wait! Why are you running away? Who was that guy? I see. How convenient. How? Three months before the incident...Perfect. Stop following me! I'll call the police! Ah, he can't see me. Who...are you? Whether you like it or not, I'll tell you who I really am. And who you really are, Naomi Katagaki. "Award" Stop it! Stop! You came. Did I have a choice? You have nothing better to do. How do you know? I'm busy on Saturdays. 200 books a year, huh? "Kyoto Historical Records Center" 7 years ago in 2020, a joint project was initiated between pluura, Keito University and Kyoto. "Chronicle Kyoto." You're all familiar with pluura, the biggest web company in the world. Their mapping services are now an indispensable part of our lives. 2D maps will be converted to 3D to achieve greater detail. They can even go back in time and preserve the history of any city in any time period. This is the "Chronicle Kyoto" project. At least on the surface. Compiling unlimited, comprehensive data of the city requires huge amounts of memory. But the progress of pluura's quantum computer project and Keito University's new theory made it possible. Professor, we have visitors. Yeah, goody! This technology is made possible by ALLTALE, a quantum memory device with an unlimited capacity. Let's go. Huh? Hey... Excuse me! I can't stay! I'm leaving now. No time. Let's take the bus. To where? Demachiyanagi. Map it. Go to Demachiyanagi. "10 minutes" So Chronicle Kyoto is the enhanced version of this map? Right. But exponentially. The memory device, ALLTALE, has unlimited capacity. It's not just "enhanced". Multiply it by 100 million. A trillion. I can't even imagine... Hurry. We're running out of time. Did we make it? There's nothing here. Nothing here? No, there is. A very memorable event took place. In 2020, Chronicle Kyoto's true agenda was initiated in secret. Recording devices were planted all over Kyoto so ALLTALE could chronicle every detail of the city. Every detail? April 17, 2027 Naomi Katagaki was going to read a book on a riverbank when he came into contact with a drone. That is "historical data". Historical? This is "the old Kyoto" as recorded by ALLTALE. You're the "old Naomi Katagaki" as recorded by ALLTALE. And I'm accessing ALLTALE from the real world. "Naomi Katagaki, ten years from now." Me...ten years from now? I know everything about you. Because I am you. Don't say it. I know. That's why I'm here. You... want a girlfriend. No, not really. I just can't believe it. Imagine, a drone falling on you. I informed the ward office. Don't worry about it. Thanks, Mom. I remember buying this. Are you really the "future me"? Because I'm taller? You'll grow. I'm actually an avatar. I can change the way I look. Is it true that everything in this world is recorded data? It's true. But don't take my word for it. This world is a perfect duplicate of reality. This is real. This is data. Even if I switched them around, you wouldn't be able to tell. It's meaningless to try. If you say so. I have no choice but to believe you. You're pretty flexible. It's kind of like Egan. "'Permutation City' by Greg Egan" But if so... what are you doing here in this duplicate universe? I told you once. I'll say it again. Wait! To help you survive the anguish of youth. In other words, to find you a girlfriend. Settling in? Not really. All right! Let's go back to class, Misuzu. OK. See you at lunch. See ya. Over here! Pass! Cut it out! Oops! I'm very sorry. BBQ meat bun! Gimme two of those! Twister, please. So Yukawa senpai said... That's my seat. Oh...sorry. "Let's read a book a week - The Library Committee" Uh... Hey, wait! - Why are you... - Shh! What if people see you talking to yourself? So thoughtful of you. So did you see her? Yes, but... - Really? - Yes. Three months from now, you and Ruri Ichigyo will be together. What's with that face? Ruri Ichigyo is not my cup of tea. What do you mean? I prefer the cute, girly type. She's like a proud wolf who'll snap my head off if I get too close. Are you saying she's not cute? I didn't say that. She's quite pretty, actually! But she's not girly! She is very girly! Are you blind? Are we talking about the same girl? I'll go see for myself. In the library, right? Don't talk to me, all right? Wait... See? It's her, right? I wouldn't mistake her. We're on the same...huh? The accident happened soon after we started dating. We were at a fireworks festival when lightning struck a tree. She was right near it. She never woke up again. I'm here to "manipulate the past". Manipulate? I want to rewrite the past and prevent the accident. If she's alive, relevant data will rewrite itself as well. "The world in which Ruri Ichigyo lives" will be recorded in ALLTALE's memory. Will it mean anything, though? Even if Ruri is alive in ALLTALE's memory... She won't exist in reality. So why... We just started going out. We hadn't gone anywhere yet. We had no memories. Not even one photo. I just want one thing. To see her smile. Her happy smile. I want a record, a memory of that. Even if it doesn't exist in reality. Even if it doesn't belong to me. But I can't do anything. As an avatar, I can't touch anything in this world. I'm powerless. Please help me. [...uh... I don't understand any of this. I don't even know her that well. I can't imagine dating her. But... of course I'd love to date a girl as pretty as she is. If I can prevent the accident, I'd like to help... Um... What should I call myself? Call me "Sensei". It's just a formality. I'll teach you everything. I'm ten years older, after all. But how can I help? I'm really pretty useless. You should know. You're me. You're not powerless anymore. You have me and "this guy". Naomi? I'm going! "Scenic Spot Narabigaoka" Imagine the outcome. As realistically as possible. Imagine something simple. Plastic... Rubber, paper... Use your mind... Grab it! Wow. It's called "God's Hand". A device that can directly access ALLTALE's data and rewrite the world itself. Turn air into water. Dirt into gemstones. Void into matter. This is an illusion. As an avatar, I have limited access within ALLTALE, but God's Hand has physical access. It can touch and even intervene. Use the glove effectively, and illusion will become reality. So...I can do anything? In theory, yeah. But there are rules. You can only rewrite something the glove actually touches. You can't create something from a distance. "You can create things spatially too." Processing speed depends on the volume of information. It's easy to manipulate simple structures like water. Complex structures take more time and are harder to visualize. The hardest thing to manipulate is a living organism. Where is almost all the data in a human body stored? The brain? The human mind is densely packed with information. Even God's Hand can't manipulate that. So you can't rewrite people's feelings. Right. That... "Ultimate Manual" is my job. 1/4/2020 I got on the bus and headed to Kita Library to check out a book. Something happened that day that brought us a little closer. So if ll do exactly what you did, Ichigyo-san and I will be together... Isn't it better if I don't do anything and just leave things alone? Revision of data was initiated the minute you and I made contact. It may get off track. We need to be proactive about keeping it in sync. I see. Leave it to me. Just do exactly what the book says. The future is recorded in the "Ultimate Manual”. What should I do, Sensei? First, take out a book. Open it. Drop it. -Um... - Pick it up. What am I doing? Whoa. OK. Not OK! I clearly turned her off! Your "Ultimate Manual" sucks! Calm down. It's a process. Uh...Ichigyo-san. Sorry about yesterday. I was trying to pick this up... I was looking for that. Sorry I slapped you. No, I'm sorry! I should've explained. Here. Thank you. No problem. "Give her the bookmark. Make up with Ruri." Did we get a bit closer? A bit. There's no rush. Love has just begun. "April 23, Notice from the Committee" Love has just begun. "Bring rags to clean bookshelves on Monday." "Please distribute info." "To: Ruri Ichigyo" "Cleaning today!" "From: Ruri Ichigyo" "Thanks for letting me know." "May 6, Library Committee shift" Ready to go home? I'm going this way. I saw you on my bus that day. Don't you live this way? No...uh... I was going to Kita Library that day! It's the only place that carries "Mystery Magazine". I see. Same here. I read it there every month. "She asked me about my bus route." "Why? Is she suspicious?" Could it be...? "Fire hazard: No fireworks allowed" Sensei. Sensei! Look! Amazing, right? It's metal! Metal! It's nice and dense with very slight impurities. I've been practicing secretly at night. I can make steel! Isn't that amazing? It's just an image. Don't be scared. Deal with it. I can't! I'm new at this! " Can't"? Do you intend to say that when the lightning strikes? Whatever you do will have an effect. You have to be able to protect her no matter what happens. You have to be able to do anything. "God's Hand" is that powerful. The rest is up to you. Use your imagination. You can make metal in the blink of an eye. Set your mind free, like in a fairy tale. Believe that anything is possible. Control everything. That's freezing! Hot water! Ow! Hot! Sterling? Bronze... You have a long way to go. Sorry. It's time! I have to go! Wait! Today is the day! I'm afraid of heights. Everyone's scared of something. I'll do the higher shelves. Then I'll do the lower... The big books are heavy. I'll do it. The middle shelves, then. OK. Thank you. Dividing the bookshelves by level wasn't the most efficient way, but it gave me a chance to talk to her more. That was a turning point. Ow! Stop it! What are you grinning at? I'm not grinning! Good for you. Thanks to your future notes. What should I do next? Just continue on this path and everything will be fine. As long as we have future data, you and Ruri will become a couple. "June 25th Used Book Sale" Our biggest event of the year is the used book sale. Who's heard of it? I guess it's not that famous... We'll start collecting used books for the sale today. We need salesgirls. Salesgirls dress cute. Salesgirls! Misuzu-san in cosplay! - How about you, Ruriri? - No thanks. Please stop calling me that. - Come on, Ruu-ri. - No. - Ruririnne. - I said no. The used book sale in June is a big event for us as well. Collect lots of books. OK. Gold! You're taking too long. Collect books... We put collection boxes in our classroom. Please contribute. "Collection Box" We shouldn't get our hopes up. We have to go all out and collect as many books as we can. Let's do it. "Keiraku Newspaper" "37 books collected" That's not bad. Bring some more from home if you can. Thanks. Shall we? Over here. These were my late grandfather's. I don't think they'll sell for much. Wow... Let's bring these in. I was hesitant to bring in so many books on my own, but I want to do everything I can to help. Are you sure? They're your grandfather's precious books. Of course I'll miss them. But my grandfather wouldn't be angry with me. Books are meant to be read. How should we transport these? Let's do it ourselves. It'll cost money to have them delivered. What kind of books do you like? Me? Uh... I don't know the answer... I'm not particular. A bit of everything, I guess. I see. I like adventure novels. People who challenge themselves and never give up impress me. That's how I want to live my life. I...I... like science fiction. It opens my eyes to a new and beautiful world. Not a dream world, but an extension of the ordinary world. It makes me feel as if I'm part of the story. The real me is just an extra. I'm not doing a good job of explaining, but I like science fiction. I see. That feeling. I think I get it. Really? Oh! "Great Underwater Cities" I'd like to read this book. Why don't you take it? I'll buy it at the book sale. This is a library card. I think he got it from a library sale. It's kind of nice. I think it would feel great to be the first name on the library card. Ruu-ri, what is all this? Shall we carry them to the library? Sorry to make you give up so many books, Ruu-ri. They were just lying in the attic. Thanks, Ruu-ri. I told you... It was the lights. See? We're lucky the school didn't burn down. We could've prevented it. Then history would change. This fire was a necessary process. The book sale was cancelled. I tried desperately to cheer her up. And as a result, we got even closer. You should do the same. The idiot. I can't. But, but... This is... Sensei? Thank you! Ichigyo-san? Good morning. This one box was in a different place. It's not even 50 books, but we can still hold the book sale. This book... Ichigyo-san. I'm glad these books were salvaged. Katagaki-san. Ruu-ri, Katagaki-kun. Are you guys... Who knew? This box. - We're not the only ones. - These were just lying around. - These are light novels... - I brought my manga collection. "Used Book Sale, Library 2nd floor" Grandmother, what big eyes you have! The better to read used books with, my dear. Can I take a picture? Of course, my dear! Why are you sitting there? Wait! Hey! Used books fair! You looked tired so I didn't wake you. What is it? Nothing. I want to sell lots of books. So I dressed up. And um... "Donation ¥34,950. Sold out!" - Yes! - Katagaki-san. Thank you. I didn't do anything. Thank you. "'Great Underwater Cities' Loaned to: Ruri Ichigyo" [...uh... I... I'm in love with you. I see. It takes two to be in a relationship. So shall we try together? That's the book you wanted to read. I reserved it for you. It's almost time. Unleash your creativity. - Let your imagination run wild! - Yes You can do more. You can do anything. Just accept it, you can do anything. Believe the world is yours. Become... God! You pass. "July 3, Ujigawa Fireworks Festival" - Let's eat shaved ice. - We have to reserve a spot. "Saturday, July 3rd Ujigawa Fireworks Festival" We went to the fireworks festival. Lightning struck at 20:01. I tried to avoid asking her out. But the sky is clear here. Can we prevent it? If nothing happens. What if it does? What is that? - It found us. - What? The homeostatic system. ALLTALE's system files are trying to return the data to its original state. What should we do? Make a weapon. What? I can hurt him. OK! Protect her until we get past 20:01. Hold them off. And afterwards? I'll tell you later. Go! OK! Behind you! Right! 30 degrees to the left! Inside! Wait! Hey! This is bad. Hurry! This is... They're really pushing it! Naomi, that's the spot! - Ichigyo-san! - What? Ow... My leg. Dammit! Two more minutes! Naomi! Sensei. It's do or die now. Forget the consequences. Go for broke! Yes, Sensei! One more minute. Don't stop! Keep creating! 10 more seconds! You can do it. "Origin of the Black Hole" I did it... Good! Katagaki-san? Ichigyo-san, you're safe. I did it. I did it! Good. Thank goodness. Sorry! What? What's going on? Katagaki-san! Katagaki-san! The hardware and software weren't in sync. There should be no discrepancy between the brain and the quantum spirit. The state of mind should be closer to what it was that day. Sensei? The data finally exceeded the limit. We can sync now. What are you talking about? Um... Get her out of there. She fell in love. She fell in love with you. Her current state of mind is in sync with the past. Now the preparations are complete. She didn't die when she was struck by lightning. But she's in a coma Katagaki-san! Stop! Thank you. Goodbye, Naomi. "Kyoto Prefectural Government" I missed you. Katagaki...san? I need something that can transport me. Is he OK? Come out! Come out! A plane, a car, I'll take a bike! An elevator! Stairs! Anything! Give me water! Anything! Come on! No evidence of after effects at this time. But regaining consciousness in her condition? It's a miracle. With ALLTALE's data, we can repair the brain damage. But that data cannot be moved back and forth. "She doesn't exist anymore in ALLTALE." Maybe she's at home... What is this? "Critical data has been lost." "Do not use this domain until data is restored." Open up! Give her back! Ichigyo-san! "Safe Mode" Sensory recognition is diminishing. Let's increase the module. Its metabolism is maxed out. Professor Senko, Ms. Xu. Naomi. Part of its memory is lost. We don't know why. Do you? No, but I'm more concerned about its condition. The damage is causing other parts of its memory to be altered. The butterfly effect will soon exceed the threshold. If the damage continues to increase ALLTALE will be destroyed. What shall we do? A recovery. Recovery? What? Let's extract all the lost data. We'll fix it later. Wow, that's a huge job. Can you start now? Yes. I'll go change. Why? Why did this happen? I guess it's goodbye. Good riddance. "Possible recovery of neuroquantum data" "Help Wanted! Senko Laboratory needs you" "Naomi Katagaki Novice!" "Naomi Katagaki System Management Main Director” "Unilateral weakness in the lower left extremities" Ready for recovery. We have no choice. "Run System Recovery 7" "Recovery" means rebooting after partial deletion of ALLTALE's data. Let's free up some memory. Start the "sifting" process. The city... The world will be deleted. Am I... You're the "old Naomi Katagaki" as recorded by ALLTALE. Am I... The world recorded in ALLTALE's database. Am I going to die? Ichigyo-san! Maybe somewhere... No. Impossible. There's no guarantee I'll survive it! Just do exactly what the book says. The future is recorded in the "Ultimate Manual”. "The book sale was a success! "She was smiling!" Am I...dead? Naomi Katagaki. You can talk? Yes, I can. So I'll answer your question. You are not dead. I am your ally. Ally? Naomi Katagaki. You must get Ruri Ichigyo back. Good. It's on auto. It'll take about 80 hours. Recovery will take 1,000 times that. Is the homeostatic system the cause? Controlling the massive data within ALLTALE is no easy task. It's like the wall of a dam. We should do some maintenance before restoring the data. Right, Naomi? What? Katagaki-san is at the hospital. Ah, with his girlfriend. Great. She regained consciousness. He must be relieved. He must be. Bring Ichigyo-san back? The world is distorted. The homeostatic system will try to delete Ruri Ichigyo to correct the distortion. That may be true, but I'm powerless. No, you have the power. You trained hard and developed the power yourself. Who are you? I'm... merely a crow that has watched you try your best these past three months. Naomi Katagaki. Do you want her? Yes! Ten years... Yeah. You've been in a coma since the lightning accident. It's a miracle you woke up. I've been in an accident myself over these past ten years. So much has happened. But I'm glad I never gave up. I was able to see you again. Do you remember? The night of the fireworks festival? Here. I... I've been waiting. That book. That book? No. You're not Katagaki-san. What the heck? No way! Are you telling me this is also the past? Stop! The goal of the system is... removal of foreign substances. Stop! Get away from her! Stop! This is... Katagaki-san? Ichigyo-san! Naomi? It can't be. That's impossible. Katagaki-san. These homeostatic system droids are targeting you. Me? But it's OK. I'll take care of them. Please come off. Let's go back to our world. Naomi! It's out of control! I don't know what's happening! Internal capacity? Quantum memory is in a loop. The data keeps multiplying! It's bad! Exceeding logical boundaries! Did you hear that? Naomi! We need you! You're too slow. They'll catch you. Then... Wow... How much further? Just go straight 1.9 kilometers. - Will it be there? - Yes. The ideal spatial coordinate to reconvert Ruri Ichigyo to ALLTALE. Grand staircase, Kyoto Station Building. Should I create a car, a motorcycle? I can't drive! - Can you ride a bike? - Yes! I can do this! ALLTALE's sphere of influence is growing. The droids can originate from any address within its sphere of influence. Ichigyo-san, close your eyes. Don't let go of me. There's no time! You can do it! Hurry! Get in! Go! Why? To return her to the original world. This is my responsibility. I... I only wanted to see her smile again. "Unilateral weakness in the lower left extremities" I'll make it up to you. Where to, Naomi? Kyoto Station! Grand staircase! It's the homeostatic system! It's going crazy, trying to stop the data from propagating! Emergency program? It won't work. We may have to turn it off manually. Turn it off manually? Go up. - Naomi! A road! Uphill! - Yes Idiot! Get it right! Ichigyo-san! It's OK, sit back! We're here. Please clear the stairs. - What is this? - Oh my god! "Converter". Going down all the stairs will complete the conversion. The droids will be here shortly. Hurry! First, we have to convert Ruri Ichigyo. Can you go down? Your leg... I think so. But... Ichigyo-san. It'll be fine. Let's do it. Let's do it. Then follow me. Yes. Hurry. What's wrong? Are you... really Katagaki-san? No. He's Naomi Katagaki. I'm just an extra. Now, go. You loved me, didn't you? Thank you. Goodbye. Ichigyo-san... I... loved you. Done! Katagaki... Katagaki-san! Hurry Naomi, you're next! OK! Watch out! This is crazy! No... Naomi! Crush it, Naomi! How? Make a huge one! A shaft. And a jet. Destroy it! Can you recreate the stairs? There are discontinued fragments. I need some time. You're kidding me... Professor, are you sure? If we stop the homeostatic system, ALLTALE's data will grow exponentially. In Japanese, it's called "Creation". Creation? The birth of a new world. The Big Bang. - Look at the sky! - The colors! It's creepy. - What is this? - What the heck? Sensei, get back! I'll use this... It's too risky. The mass is too huge. The damage will be magnified, too. What? What should I do then? Naomi. Sensei... There's a way to destroy it. Really? Tell me how! Use "God's Hand" and delete me. Huh? What... You know why. But...that's... We have no choice. But that doesn't guarantee that this thing will go away. The system tried to delete her. Not bring her back. Delete her. It's a way to void a duplicate address. ALLTALE's mind and this world's body. The homeostatic system droids decided that duplicates were unnecessary. It's either you or me. It'll stop if one of us disappears from this world. It'll be a great tragedy if you go. We have no choice. No! No! I can't do it! It's OK! I can do it. I'll destroy this monster and... Naomi! And create another converter again... No. No! No... You told me to believe that I could do anything. I can do it! So both of us can live! That's right. You can do anything, if you believe. Sensei...Sensei... Sensei. Naomi Katagaki. Be happy. She was the first person I chose. My future ended the day Ichigyo-san was struck down. I decided I'd do anything to get her back. To get our future back. Our future... I'm happy. Do it! Ichigyo-san! Katagaki-san. Katagaki-san. Katagaki-san. Thank you. Where did it go? Into a new universe? What? I don't know what it's like but I hope it's better than here. Katagaki-san. Did we return to the original world? I think... this is a new world yet to be discovered. - We did it! - It's a success! He woke up! The software and hardware needed to be in sync. You took actions for the one you loved. Your mind finally synced with your body. We did it. Katagaki-san. Ichi...gyo... "From the Library Committee: Reminders for Summer Break" "To: Tsunehisa Senko" "Naomi Katagaki"
