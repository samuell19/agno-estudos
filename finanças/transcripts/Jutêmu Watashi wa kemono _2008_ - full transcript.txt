I DON'T NEED YOU TO FIGURE ME OUT. I don't need you to figure me out. I don't need you to figure me out. I don't need you to figure me out! JE T'AIME: I AM A BEAST Would you like to change your life? If I take this job, will I be able to change my life? I changed mine. I stopped hesitating... to live. I just arrived at the hotel. I'm heading to the customer's suite. You may feel nervous about meeting the clients, but they also feel anxious. They wonder, what is she like? Will she be repulsed by me? They are as nervous as you are. There are words that should never leave your mouth. You must never mock the clients' sexual prowess Sometimes men carelessly brag about their penis size. Even if they are being ridiculous, you have to humor them. Men are so touchy about their penis size that sometimes it's hard not to laugh. My name is Shizuka Ono. Pleased to meet you. Nice to meet you. May I please phone the office? -Huh? -It's a rule. I just met Mr. Rai. No matter what, you must always phone in in front of the customer. This informs them that someone knows where you are. That way, they won't try anything funny. This call is the guarantee of safety for you and the client alike. Wow, I didn't expect such a pretty girl. Don't stop at anything to make the customer happy. Come here. Turn around. Now face me. Lift your arms. Put them down. However, you don't have to do anything that repulses you. For example, kissing. Is kissing off-limits? Yes. If someone requests anal, you can say that the office does not allow it. But will you kiss me... there? Yes. -Is it really all right? -Yes. I guess I'll endure it. But if you're in the mood for anal or bondage, you can go ahead. However, don't expect to get paid extra. When people bear the things they hate to make a living, they grow weak. This feels like a dream - to undress such a beautiful woman! If you don't like something, just say so. Take the rest off yourself. What men really want from you is a fantasy. A fantasy that lasts one night. A beautiful young girl who serves them and obeys their every word. It's dream that rarely comes true. Every man is fed up with some aspects of his life. For one night only, you give them a new life. That is the part you play. Think of yourself as an actress who brings the client's fantasy to life. This world is a jungle. You will have to be a different animal every night. Exotic... Ferocious... Wounded... Sometimes, inconceivably adorable. Sometimes, wilder and more dangerous than you ever imagined. You're a call girl, aren't you. Such a cute face... I have a daughter about your age. What would your parents think if they knew? I have no parents. Someone must have raised you. Your parents are probably hard-working people just like me. How do you look people in the eye? As long as you're getting paid anything goes, huh? But a day will come when you regret this. You'll be punished for this. It's a tough world out there. I don't need you to figure me out. What? I don't need you to figure me out. I don't need you to figure me out. Get out. Get the hell out! Go ahead, sleep with some man you've never seen before! Who the hell are you to talk to me like this?! What the hell are you doing, you bitch? Here is your money. Keep the change. YATSUKA REAL ESTATE CORPORATION You have reached Yatsuka Real Estate. We are closed for today. Please leave a voicemail. This is Yuka Murakami from Takizawa apartments. My keys have been stolen. Please change the lock on my door. Please call me back. No! I’m going to scream! WELCOME BACK Although both parties express desire to pass the bill as soon as possible. due to strife in Democratic Party, heated debates in Diet continue. Democratic Minister Shindo, who revealed secret plans to deploy the JSDF to Iraq declined to comment on the situation and resigned. This job is a little different. Do you want to try? The client requested two girls. He said he wants to party with two women. That's what he requested. Are you Shizuka? Yes. My name is Miyuki. Nice to meet you. Same here. Gorgeous. It's your tip. Today, I want to go over the top. All the payments are handled by the management. But this is just a tip. The management doesn't need to know. You want to take it, don't you? No... Take it! Come on.... -I'm not allowed to... -Go on! Go on, take it! It's not necessary. Pick it up. Pick it up, and I'll let you keep it. Thatta girl. Here's your bonus. It's not good to waste money, even if you have a lot of it. Don't put on airs. We need some champagne! We can't have a party without champagne. I want the finest champagne you have at this hotel. Yeah... that'll do. And 3 glasses - the most expensive kind. Will you do anything I ask for? Yes. Anything at all? -No kissing. -Huh? And no anal. Anal?! Yes. Same here. Are there girls who are fine with that? Yes. Women are really something. They're really something, huh? Incredible. You don't have a girlfriend, do you? Why are you asking? Even though you are young and have a lot of money. I have dated many women - dozens, maybe hundreds. Half of them broke up with me saying that all I talk about is work. The other half I dumped because all they wanted was my money. You are quite unlucky. What I really want is to have a harem. To have many beautiful women to choose from is a man's dream. It sounds like a lot of work. It's not easy to satisfy even one woman at a time. Cheers. You are beautiful, Miyuki. Really beautiful. You too, Shizuka. People in this town look as if they've been dragged through the mud. Yes. People who resent their lives become unclean. Don't you want to be clean? You are sparkling, Miyuki. Are you a strong person? I wonder... I don't know. WELCOME BACK He's a young politician. They often show him on TV. I insist that those documents are real. One of our clients wants to send him a present. Can you go? You are the present. Make sure he enjoys it. Am I speaking to Mr. Koichiro Shindo? Who's this? My name is Shizuka Ono. I came here to give you a gift. A gift? If we speak face-to-face, I think you'll understand. Hello? Are you alone? Yes. Come up. Who the hell are you? I came here to give you a gift... What kinda gift? What did you bring? It's me. One of our clients wanted to make you a present. Who sent you? I don’t know his name. Are you that kind of woman? May I make a phone call? Where? The office. It's a rule. I'm here. The client seems surprised. Hey, it's Shindo. Got any idea who sent a call girl to my place? Without even asking me first. I can't accept a gift if I don't know who it's from. Who sent her? Tell me the name! Someone set a trap for me. I know who might have done it. A trap? This has nothing to do with you. If I am inconveniencing you, I can leave. Was there anyone outside when you came in? No. What about the door to the apartment across? It was closed. They must have sent someone to take pictures. Pictures? Koichiro Shindo is a sex addict who invites call girls into his home. Can this kind of mayor be trusted? That’s what they'll say in the media. Stay here. I don't want any trouble. Can I play some music? Yeah. Sorry. If you feel thirsty, the refrigerator is right here. If you're hungry, order delivery. What do you want me to do? You don't need to do anything. Are you in Tokyo? What? You're still in Washington? What time tomorrow? Understood. In that case, call me tomorrow from Narita Airport. I received a present. It's a woman. It’s probably Miyajima's work. It's his style. Politicians like him are destroying Japan. See you tomorrow. I'll be waiting for you. I was waiting for him to take you outside. For him? He's the brains behind my campaign. The only one who's still on my side. Is he not coming until tomorrow? Yes. Do you expect me to stay here until tomorrow? -Do you not want to? -Isn't it obvious? I'm the one being inconvenienced here. Stay in the room. There used to be a Japanese escort service in LA. Their clientele consisted of Japanese financiers on business trips. Really? Well... I wanted to know what kind of women worked there, and why. They were all so naive. When I asked them why they chose the sex industry, They said they aspired to it, that it was glamorous. After that, I couldn't trust women for a while. You can't trust women because some of them aspire to sex work? Of course. You told that girl that she shouldn't sell her body. That she was better than that. You gave her a lecture instead of sleeping with her. How did you know? I've had clients like that. All they do is berate me. Even though it was them who asked me to come. Isn't that the best kind of client? I hate that kind the most. They respect you as a human being! They're mocking me! They think I'm pitiful. Some women want to work in sex industry. Is that why you chose this job? Yes. How old are you? 21. You are deceiving yourself. Deceiving myself? You bet. You don't want to think about the real reason you became a prostitute. You're just telling yourself that you like it. You work hard to pretend that you're not unhappy. If you keep living like this, nothing will get resolved. What do you mean? Your life. How miserable you are. I am not miserable! If you don't realize you have a problem, it will suck you in like quicksand. Your misery will only get deeper. What are you doing? I am not miserable. How about the fact that you get naked in front of strangers? Does being naked make one unhappy? You have to take off your clothes even in front of men who repulse you. When we face each other naked, men are rather cute. When men are wearing clothing they are much worse. Bad people could be anywhere. At work, in school, and in my case, even at home. -Don't walk around half-naked! -Does it bother you? Yes, it bothers me. Stop it. I'm going to take a bath. Would you like to join me? Don't get carried away. -I'm a loose woman, remember? -I never acquired a taste for your sort. Did anything happen? Yeah. I received a phone call from my wife. Why doesn't she come here? She took the kid and left. She said she couldn't stomach the things I was doing. That to become popular... to be famous... I was neglecting my own family. So that's what kind of a man you are. I said, "Oh, really?!" "I don't need you to figure me out." People like to come up with explanations and psychoanalyze others. It makes them feel safe. "You are deceiving yourself," they say. "You don't want to admit that you're unhappy." If you keep living like this, nothing will get resolved. I don't need you to figure me out. I am a sex worker by choice. I am not miserable. I am not lying to myself. Please hold me. That's what I came here for. Yes, Sir. Yes! Everything is ready. As a politician, I wanted no part of this. I tipped off the news. What? Even you participate in this? Excuse me. I'll be right back. But... I just left the hotel. Good job. The client disappeared. What do you mean? He left the room and never came back. I'm going home now. Koichiro Shindo, who publicized classified diplomatic correspondence with the U.S., has been kidnapped by unknown perpetrators As he was leaving hotel bar yesterday night, he was assaulted and possibly kidnapped. It's unclear what prompted the attack. Did you watch the news? I don't think you have anything to worry about, but let's take some precautions. Delete your call history and stop carrying your phone. Is this all you have? I'm sorry, we carry only this variety. -Good work, everyone! -Good work! -What are you having for lunch? -Good job! Is your name Yuka Murakami? Yes. I need to ask you a few questions. Will you accompany me to the station? Yesterday at 4: 13pm you were at Hotel Rambert, Suite 2375. Correct? You're on security footage, clear as day. We know who you are and what you were doing there. How many times did Shindo fuck you? Around midnight, he left the room. What happened? -Nothing. -Liar! You must have been right in the middle of doing it. Why would a man leave you all alone at a time like this? There was a phone call. -Who called? -I don't know. Go on! Shindo seemed shocked and left the room. He got dressed just for that? You were fucking, weren't you? No, we weren't. Why's that? A pretty girl like you came to have sex with him, and he did nothing? Yes. Why? -Why? -I don't know! He called you, and then didn’t do anything? -All this time? -Yes. Why? -Why? -I have no idea! If it were me, I would fuck you over and over again! Looks like you don't carry a cellphone. You got scared and hid it somewhere, right? I could arrest you for prostitution right now! So tell me - what did you do with Shindo, and how many times? Come on, spill it! Shindo was drinking alone until closing time. He was sulking at the bar counter not talking to anyone. He must have been traumatized by something. Do you remember what they talked about? -I couldn't hear it. -Where were you? -In the room. -Where in the room? -In the center. -What were you doing? -I was just standing. -And doing what? -We were talking. -What were you talking about? I was getting lectured. He received another phone call at 9:05pm. Do you remember? Shindo said that he got a phone call from his wife. Is that the one? Is that what Shindo said? Yes. Did he say anything else? He said that his wife didn't understand him. You claim that you didn't have sex with Shindo. Yes. But he talked to you about his personal life? Yes! You've done it with him, why don't you just admit it? How many times did you do it? In what position? Do you like do it face to face? Or do you prefer doggy style? Do you let men do it without wearing one? A condom. You're free to go. We may call you in for questioning again. Yes. This time, I want you to give me all the details. You're pretty calm. You seem honest without saying anything that could be used against you. I want to ask you a question. What is it? How did you find me? You're on the footage taken by security camera. But how did you know my name? Did someone report me? We can't talk about that. Who's there? It's me. Tatsuya... Open the door, Yuka. I need to talk to you. Tatsuya... You reported me to the police, didn't you. You have some nerve showing up at my place. What is this, Tatsuya?! Close it! Turn on the video camera! What are you doing, Tatsuya?! We are going to film a porno. You'll let anyone fuck you! I will show everyone what kind of a woman you are! Let everyone take a look at what you really do. No!!! Hold her down! You look good when you're gagged. Educational video. Hold her down! I need to check your meter. Ms. Murakami? Are you there? Ms. Murakami! Keep struggling, and I'll cut you! Turn her towards the camera! Quick! That's enough, Tatsuya. This went to far. We’re getting out of here. What the fuck?! On your back! You're pathetic, Tatsuya. Pathetic. After I slept with you. you came after me. You were clinging to me and begging me not to leave you! You said you couldn't live without me! You're the pathetic one! That's why I changed. I didn't want to be a pathetic woman. What can be more pathetic than sleeping with strangers? Better than sleeping with you. Don't try to act tough! I'll sleep with you one more time. It will be just like that time you were clinging to me. You missed me too, didn't you? -Tatsuya... -What? Sex with you... is not as good as you think. Don't be full of yourself. What the fuck? What's wrong with you, you bitch! Please stop... What happened? Time to wake up. -Wake up! -Please stop... Please stop... Where am I? Who the hell are you? You don’t remember? It was you... then... Yes. Did you get this for me? Why are you doing this? Because you were lying unconscious in the rain. It's a mystery. What is? Seeing you without makeup. You look like a different person. Let's take your clothes off once again. So you see that I am the same person. Don't try to hard to seduce me. It's a really short notice, but I wondered if you're available. I need to leave now. I don't know what time I'll be back. So put the keys under the pot outside when you leave. Going to work? Yes. Do you think this job suits you? You look much better dressed like this. You look like a regular woman now. This job is not for you. You should live as your true self. You meet all sorts of people on this job. Some ask me to try on different outfits and jerk off in front of me. Some want to pretend we're married and go for a walk. -And recently. I met a young girl... -Stop! That's enough! I asked her why she was alone. She said she didn't know where her home was, and I thought she was lost. It turned out that she lived very close. She just didn't want to go home. When she is with her mother, is she hiding her feelings? When she refuses to go home, is she being true to herself? It’s not like that. It's not for you to decide what is real and what is fake. There is no "real" or "fake" side to me. Both sides are a part of the whole. What if I... forced myself on you right now? Would you resist me? or... submit and take the money? Why don't you try? Then you'll know what I would do. Nice to meet you. My name is Shizuka Ono. Pleased to meet you. Do you feel bad for me? More than anything else, I hate it when people feel bad for me. That's why my father sent you here. It was my dad. right? I do not know that. Don't bullshit me! Who wants a woman their parents paid for? If you don't want me here, I'll leave. If you don't like me. I didn't say that. I just asked you not to pity me. Come on, do it! Stop! Stop it! Would you like to stay here? Or move to bed? Why are you so kind... to someone like me? It's my job. Goodbye. One more time! I want to see your body one more time. Yes. Sometimes, the customer will want to take a picture. You cannot let them. You never know where your picture may end up. Looking at your picture would give me the will to live. Let me take it! Please! No pictures. Don't you trust me? After all the kindness I showed you? You don't believe me?! Where were you? Right here. Was whatever you went through that terrifying? Yes. The fear found its way inside of me. I have to go to work. At the dollar store. Really? You can stay at my place if that's all right with you. The whereabouts of Koichiro Shindo remain unknown. The information publicized by Shindo has been proven baseless. Driven into a corner, Shindo Daigeshi faked his own kidnapping. -On one hand... -Idiots! Driven into a corner, Shindo Daigeshi faked his own kidnapping... What? There was some old fart in your room. Are you seeing johns in your own home? Say something! I have nothing to say to you, Tatsuya. Please don't leave! I can't live without you. No matter what you did, I will forgive you. I don't need your forgiveness. What are you going to forgive me for? I really loved you. Tatsuya. At times I thought I would die without you. Why did you stop loving me? Because you only think of yourself. You don't understand others' feelings. You don't even try. I've been surrounded by people like you ever since I was little. I've had enough. Does he understand the way you feel? Does that old man understand you? Welcome back. What are you doing? What does it look like I'm doing? I borrowed this. I regained my bearings. Thought I'd cook for you before I leave. I often made this when I lived in the United States. Did you go grocery shopping? Yes, even though I was terrified. Are you leaving? They're trying to say that I faked my own kidnapping. I can't hide in here forever. Well, how do you like it? Say something. It's delicious. Really? Glad to hear it. I see. Want some? Cheers! There was a girl at the park today. I wonder if it was the little girl you met. The one who does not want to go home. She sat there all alone. She reminded me of you. -Just like that girl, you-- -Please stop. -I don't need you-- -To figure me out? You are not the only one who feels this way. I do too. I have a house, but no place to call home. I never felt lonely until now. I've always been surrounded by people. Ever since I was a child, there were people who supported me. But now, I don't have anyone. You are the only person who’s still on my side. Only you tried to protect me. Please stop. I am not on anyone's side. I'm glad you picked up. Sorry about the short notice. Are you available? No? You would need to leave right now. I'm coming. I understand. Yes. Understood. I have to go. Your usual job, huh? -Yes. -Why? -Why are you doing this? -There was this woman. She jumped off the building across the street. If I weren't doing this. I might have done the same thing. Is it the money? No. I haven't used a single yen I earned this way. I don't get it. -I don't need anyone to understand me! -But I do! I want people all over the world to understand what I am doing! That's what it means to be alive! You let me, a complete stranger, into your home. You are infinitely kinder than you think. Why are you trying to close your heart to other people? What are you trying to accomplish by pushing everyone away? Thank you for cooking for me. It was delicious. Hold on! Let go of me. Why are you going there? Because I want to be strong. If I weren’t strong, I would not be alive right now. Is that where you find strength? Yes! I can't believe you. The path to strength is different for everyone. I also wanted to become stronger. When they were torturing me. I kept thinking, "I won't tell them anything!" At that moment, I could have endured anything, but... then I grew too scared. I was scared of anything that could happen. I was afraid of everything in the world! You protected me when I was weak. You offered me your support. You gave me strength! The path to strength is different for everyone. Just like you said! -I have to go! -Give it up! -Give it up! -Get off me! Don't go! People hold each other close because they want to understand each other. A man holds a woman... A woman holds a man... ...because they want to know each other. That's why we have sex. We do it... to feel the warmth of each other's bodies. Don't you think so? Don't you think so?! I don't want to understand anyone. I have no need for other people's warmth. So? What do you think? May I call the office? What? It's a rule. Oh, I see. I have arrived. There are 2 men here. That wasn't the deal! Get out of there immediately! We wouldn't want anything bad to happen to you. Leave the room right now. I have been told to return to the office. I'd like to leave now. You can't just leave after getting us so excited! -I didn't know there would be two of you-- -Double the fun, right? Sandwich! We will make you feel like you never have before! He's a real pro. Just relax and leave it to him - he'll take you straight to heaven! You bitch! Let's get on with it, miss. You're going to enjoy yourself. The more you struggle, the more we'll enjoy it. Here we go, now she won’t get away. Wait. She fights like an animal. Hold her arms and legs. -We should tie her legs, too. -Legs? Yeah. Just like that. Such a pretty girl, huh? -Wait. -Ignore it. -Hold her down. -Yeah. What is it? This is security. Everything is fine here. Please open the door. Don't mess this up. The fun is just about to begin. That girl works for me. If you persist in being a nuisance, I will call the police. If you call the police, you will be the one in trouble. Let me in. Full name, place of employment - we know everything about our customers. We'll report the rape. Is that all right with you? Get dressed. Wanting to protect someone... ...is a kind of happiness. Wanting to protect someone... is a kind of happiness. When a man holds a woman... or when a woman hold a man... they do it because they want to know each other. Don't you think so? Don't you?! I am not on anyone's side. Why are you closing your heart to other people? What are you trying to accomplish by pushing everyone away? Because I want to be stronger. Without strength, I would not have survived. The path to strength is different for everyone. It's just as you said. You protected and supported me. You gave me strength. People hold each other close because they want to understand each other. I don't want to understand anyone! I have no need for other people's warmth.
