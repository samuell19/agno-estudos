It's okay, I am very friendly. I will control myself. Hey, you! Romantic spirit, this is the second shift! Enough with the act, wake up! I watched the whole movie. Should not we separate? - What, shit? - No, but she is a neighbor. Who are the parents? I don't know. The grandfather lives. He is retired. What is the problem? Go on, get yourself out more. Catherine, we couldn't resist. It's not our fault if this Wednesday is a powered one. Such a beautiful creature like you. Oh, my God, what an infamy! Catherine, all remedial, do not cry! Katyusa, come to me, okay? What do you think? And then... but tomorrow? You need to rest today. - See you tomorrow. - Go away, you son of a bitch! Son of a bitch. It's okay. Well ... You know what? A little bit of money for you. It is to buy yourself something, right? Let me ... Yes, ma'am! Going home? Where else? Get laid and go home. - Gave her money? - Yeah. One fifty. Damn! Nice it was ... Oops! Get your hands off! Thief! Katerina, is that you? Oh, my God! Katya. Katya, what happened? What is it, what's the matter? K?tyenka small grandchild. Darling. Tell me, where have you been? Who hurt you? Listen to me! Tell me! - Who? - He... - Who was he? - Pastuhin. The buddies. - What? Not alone? - Three of them. - Where? - The neighboring house, where his friend lives. - Maybe the grocer, or what? - Yes. Why did you go there? - He said his birthday... Let's go. Let's go, K?tyenka. Let's go, baby. My dear, dear. It's okay, it's okay. Where're you going? K?tya. Don't be silly! Right, come out, K?tya. Open the door. Open up! Fjodorics, where to? Ljoska, something bad. Ljosa. Big trouble. - Now, tell me. What happened? - Ljosa Help me, help me! - Get in the house! - K?ty?... - K?ty?... what is it? - Katya has been raped. - Who did it? - He is a... , the grocer. - Csuhanov? - Three of his friends together. - Look. So festive. - I said, Shut the door! Music, as if nothing has happened, - Now, it will kill us! - Where's Katya? - At home, in the bathroom. - That's a problem. - What problem? - The evidence is washed! - What is the evidence? - Used in such a case. Don't you understand? She must go. The evidence needs to be documented. - Then the situation would be quite different. - Perhaps they need a lesson... Well, you listen to me carefully! Now go home. Anybody's house, anywhere... ...Katya must not be allowed anywhere! If you came out of the tank, immediately sit down and write a report. You understand? What kind of report, Ljoska? Just stay alive ... It should not be so Ivan Fjodorovics! These worms. Not only her, but also raped me! Worms. Go. Let's go home. Bastards... So. Are we going in and face the encounter? How many are there? Three. One more thing. In the case of least resistance - the faces. No. The faces - ok. Cuffs. The issue before us. These men were no longer cuffed man. I'm done! Let's go! Hold on. Come here. - Is this it? - Aha. Give me the gun. Who is it? Hey, kid, what polluted my water? I'll come off the ceiling. A week ago, was the refurbishment! Open up, fucking child! - On the ground! Ground! - What is it? One more step and you get in your head - a pimple. What are you doing? What do you want? - I need to telephone! - Where, to the UN? The phone is already getting warmer. - Thank you. - You do not need a lawyer? - But I do... - Ensign! - Commander! - The best lawyer! - Got it! Calm yourself? I read your rights. We recieved a complaint and we are here in this home. Particularly dangerous crime occurred - a group rape. BTK 131st paragraph: 10 years. Little! For the crime! At the moment the victim is to testify. Except you, who took part in it? - Who was the organizer? You tell it all? - Why me? Suites the mouth. But if you do not, then who? Who did it? I just do not think that we ... You should think! And remember: extenuating circumstances, the confession in court. Done! Lieutenant, please record his truthful confession! One admitted to the violence. I did not. All because of his consent. Comrade Captain. The vessel is broken. One proof has been found. And here it is. It was in the bathroom. What's this? This is in agreement, yes? That's it, write the record! - I do not write under any protocol. - What? I do not write under any protocol. Comrade Lieutenant, you hear? The resistance may produce an action. I can see, Comrade Captain. I am ready to write the report. - Heard that? Now you sign? - No! And you have this one's neck. - Wow! How blood-thirsty you are! - You can be anyone's neck. This light-headed. But this one is insane, who has been chasing for a year! - Look out of the window, Lieutenant! - Why? It is full moon. These dangerous animals go hunting. Have you read the news on eszel?sr?l, who cut a woman's breasts and gobble? I've read. He is! You. This crude eats slaughtered breasts, there is blood on his chin. Look at the chin, pure blood! But I have not slaughtered no one! - It is not gushing? - Yes! - Only leaking? - Yes! Enter in the record! Oh! One has already admitted the crime and signed. How about you? - What did I do? - Admit? What? Sex-based violence. Listen, Captain. Somehow I don't understand what you're talking about? - Why do I need it, Captain? - What? Agree. Eh! New Russians. There is no coordination, without discussion. Anything can be bought, everything is on sale. Even the country's support and hope. Why not? Well, he is the ringleader. The organizer and chief of the sexual power. Write, Lieutenant! - I don'know it! - I'll give you that, that... It is not that, but still... Can you take the assassination of Princess Diana? Do you understand? - I do not sign anything. - No? - Not yet! - You do not have to. Sztyepanov! - Order! - This man! - Remove him! - Got it! - Criminals cell! 24 hours! And he will tell glady and will commit the filth! You know what they're doing with those who commit rape? First, they give a velvet sheet that suites your soft body. Then the feminine ass - a gift to be criminals. By morning, you shall be given to another cell, with a couple of vodka bottles. - Are you serious? - And most importantly of all law, the spirit of justice! Now, I leave. I want to see the suffering of friends tangled in the web of justice. - Stand up! - Comrade Captain! Comrade Captain! - Go ahead! - I am not free. Ease the situation! - Ah! Talk to me. - Aha. - Well done! I'll say you are the worst ones... ...compared to other criminals. But, what shit did we do? We guys assembled, drank a little. And destroyed the little girl? - Do you know ... - I asked you a question, you filthy... answer! Otherwise, you'll be in the cell within 30 minutes! - it was not intentional! - Use the word: "I" - Well, I did. - Each of the three? - Yes! - Who was the first? - Do you know ... - I repeat the question: Who was the first? - The guys said, you go! - And you went. - I was obliged to. Poor guy... How considerate! I am sure he's the boss! Like a locomotive. How much weight? - What? - The weight in kilograms? - 100 kg. - Fine. You worm! I can imagine the torture and voilence caused. But I was fast, didn't stay... You son of a bitch! Katya grew up in front of his eyes. - The sheets are full of blood! - Even the bed is broken. - Whose blood it is - your own? - I am not a gynecologist, Captain. I promise! I promise you a LOT broiler! Fix his admission! You know, a strange combination of circumstances... Good day. - Student? - Student! - What do you learn? Structural linguistics. We all learned a little something and somehow. Exactly, Comrade Captain! - Where are we going? - Everywhere. - Stud! - It's not mine. "The last of Sicily '... porn and porn. Filth! Elita. - Sit properly! - What is the connection? - Sit properly! - It looks to me... - What does it look? Comrade Captain, you should be informed... The fact is that ... The situation is that the accused's testimony has already been confirmed. The protocol has been signed. It shows that the main villain is - you! You dirty scoundrel! You dragged her into the house, and planned it all! - Why me? - Comrade Captain... Because you got me? Of course, that is the answer. I'll confirm it in writing. - What happened in here? - Group rape. - They were captured in a group. - How many are there? - Three. - Who are they? The apartment owner, Boris Csuhanov. Businessman. Well-known in the market. Podberjozkin, the sub-agent! The second, Igor Zvarugin - university student. And the third - Pasutyin. About me: Pasutyin Nikolai Petrovich. Kosajev Captain! We know each other, Nikolai Petrovich. You were here last year, passed a bad order, due to the low rate results. - And they've admitted the crime? - Yes! The trial detention with the signed minutes. - Quick work. - Faster than the mind-speed. And you, how you've been able to guess? The neighbors called. You know my son Cretin. He heard the mayhem. Drunk, boldly. Life, threatened. Money offered. Absolutely sure it is a well-planned crime.. - You allow yourself, Captain. - Excuse me! Well, all right. What to do? Supply them to the territorially competent station. And if you are asked to be moved? Give a command - the command and take them. And may I just ask? It depends. Do you have children? Yes. Two. Girls. 8 and 15 years old. Comrade Captain, I'm sorry, it turned out to be a fact. - What is it? - Every Wednesday something similar happens. What do you want to say? The fact that every Wednesday they rape someone? - To some extent some activities... - Speak clearly! The arrested Pasutyin admits. And the neighbors attest. There was a female with them last Wednesday. The men were usually sun-bathing, and a woman was seen around. - The day was of the sexual pleasures. - The evidence included? - Yes! - Witnesses? - Yes, comrade Captain. Stand up! How are you my boy? Fun, fun, you found out? - Why is the tooth... - Katya in the tooth? In fact, the trial does not permit, Comrade Colonel. It is not good for the case. The bruising creates problems. Give him to me, Captain. He should not be punished harder. Take him. Just give me a written order. What written order? "I, the undersigned, hereby say, the voilence took a great toll on Pasutyin Vagyimot... who is placed under house arrest." Date and signature. You're wrong. You're wrong, Captain. And you? You are right? I'll try to prove it to you. I will. Just wait. Where do we take them? Just don't send me back, I beg you! He would kill me. If I could be sure about this, I would've let him take you. - So now where? - The station! The cell! Captain! Do we still tend the order? Yes. And half an hour later they get out of there... The cell. - Katya! - I'm here. Good morning. Katya! Tea is getting cold. I don't understand. I look repulsive in the mirror. You know, now I remember. Here, on the third floor... ...stays a doctor. I talk to her. I always wish her. You don't have to. You should tell him everything. I don't have to tell anything, the whole place already knows it. Everybody knows? Well, I came from the police staion. Grandpa, now you no longer go out on the street? - Why not? - They will raise a finger. Let them do it. Don't they have mothers, sisters and daughters? How is she? Do not worry, Ivan Thedorovitch, it's not so bad. So I was just wrong? What were you thinking? Such situations are not never good the way they are. Now the girl is not too strong physically. Oh, my God, my God ... Stay home. The time is the best medicine. The most important - try to forget everything. Do you know why is she always in the bathroom. I was thinking that... I am so confused? No, nothing serious I could see. I'm pretty good with it. Thank God. Oh yes, the exams are due to jitter. The tests are to be expected. Call the college and tell them she is sick. I'll give a certificate. Yes. Good. Ivan Thedorovitch, don't you worry. Trust me - all will be fine. - Can you hear me? - Yes... yes. All would be fine. What does she like to eat? - Everything. - So give her healthy food. Thank you. Fjodorics, semifinals are about to begin, how are you? Yes... it's hard to be old. We must... you heard? Released... Yes! Ah, you're... How am I? Look how well I hear. I'm OK. My voice is what it's used to be. Normal. Katyerina? Well, where would she be? In college. What? Did you forget the size of your daughter? We'll talk when you come. Bye! You free? Your mother called from Turkey. Coming soon. Bringing a coat for you. What's your size? I don't remember. There's something else. Notification came. The investigators' call. - You need to go Katya. - Why? Well, they say the district was responsible and that they want this thing settled. Let it be like that. No, we won't! No, we won't! Prison is the only place for those pigs. Grandpa! I don't know... Na-na, it's all right, dear. It's gonna be okay, we'll see. No, I will never be all right. You would be... my Word. You may go in. You free? I'll wait here. Finally now. We thought you've decided to back out. What do you mean? The normal thing. Seek a peaceful agreement, for example. Well, look at what happened to you. Nothing happened to me. What about that rape? - So, what happened? - I wrote everything. Yes, you also told the police. I have the feeling as if it was intentional. But I wasn't there when that violent rape actually took place. You're strange? Of course not! If I have been embarrassed you, please forgive me. Just want to clarify the details. Well... you both... Pasutyinnal and you - know each other well? Yes, we studied in the same school. Are you friends? No. Maybe once or twice we talked in the school. You accompanied him. He held out his hand. And then raped you. Can I go? Hurt? Unnecessarily. I do not want to hurt you. But, you know the nature of our work. We deal with all kinds of humans. Just sit back. Sit down. And so the two of them ... Zvarigin and Csuhanov, you knew them also? Zvarigin is often seen in Csuhanovhoz's courtyard. This Zvarigin a sympathetic guy. Handsome. Sportsman. The girls' favorite. Right, he called you the same day in the apartment? - Yes, he and Pasutyin. - Yes, he... Well! The college does'nt have any bad opinion about Zvarigin. Why not? Probably no one is raped there. You have a point. Investigator Seveljov. Ah... you. No, I don't know. He didn't come today. Holidaying. - Boris and Csuhanov you've been aware of? - Yes. - How many years? One, ten or twenty? - I'm not yet twenty. - You are ten years old? - Twelve, yes. So, how long you know Csuhanov? Since he began visitng that house. There are people in there. - So you know Csuhanov for almost a year. - We're not friends. Szaprigina, sit down for a bit! - Hey oldie, won't you like good smell? - Stupid. And now the next question. What all was there in the home... ...where you were raped? I've never gone there before! But that night you were there. And you drank too. There is also a testimony that you went there. Enjoying together, smiling. We also know that you waited there. Why would I wait? Tell me what would I want? Answer. Maybe you wanted to make some quick money. It is also possible that you liked the house and you dreamed it to own? Perhaps it is that one of imaginations... some one might marry you. You think I would imagine marrying a prisoner? No, I don't think so. You didn't think anyone might go to a prison. - Why you destroyed all the traces? - I didn't know what to do. - Why didn't you seek medical advice? - I did'nt know about it! So, in addition to your own feelings, I know nothing of the filed case. Garbage. I'll deal with it! How are they? Grandpa! Can I really ought to go to wonderland? Or should I imagine Csuhanov's home mine? Grandfather, I'm just kidding, just kidding. Ugh, God damn it! "Miami shores..." - It's an American tourist destination. "our five thousand people are abroad." I wonder where they are? In Miami? Thieves... What are you looking at, old man? Disgusting minds. Unfortunately, all the facts have been collected and looked into. Nothing objectionable exist. Obviously... therefore, in absence of that, the criminal case stands closed. I absolutely agree with this. And all is within the framework of the Act. We parents, need to be more responsible towards our children and grandchildren. Is there any question? Do you have any? And what type? - I don't understand. - You'll understand! - Soon you'll come to understand... Son of a bitch. - What? - Whatever you heard! - Now get out of here! Don't ever step here! Oh, look at that voice! Kind of proud, bossy, important. You - so professional. Enjoying the victory so fast. Paid for everything, handsomely! Blaming old Dad, I picked up everything. There is one sentence and... Listen to it at night. You'll be smarter. Although it will do no good and there's no chance either. Son of a bitch! - Good day! - Good day! - Please come! Yes... Well you live... You tell me how it is? The country has no money, still it is building banks. What an irony? Uncle Vanya, drink a cup of tea. - Thank you. - I'd like some tea please! Ah, that's it. You want to see who comes and who goes? What brings you here? You know, I need 5 thousand dollars. - I don't understand, Uncle Vanya. - What don't you understand? I said: I need 5 thousand dollars! You want to travel? Something like that. - Nice place but the way was... - I was born here. I understand but it is worth three, maximum of five hundred. I am asking for 5 thousand dollars. The house is not important. It would be demolished. And there will be a road. You know, I need... - Uncle there has to be a serious deal. - There would be any or not? When do you need the money? Tomorrow. Hello, Fjodorics! Hello, Sura! - How are you? - Fine. - Where do you take this? - Turkey to dispose off waste. - And your grandkid? - Thank you, all right. - Grandpa, is that you? - Yes, Katy, don't be afraid. I was so worried. I was in the village. I saw my place and as... You know what happened here? - Tell me, what happened? - He came. - Who? - The Colonel. - Why? - To give money. - What kind of money? - Common money. And you accepted it? I didn't know there was any money. I opened the door, he's standing there without uniform. He said: "I'm sorry for you Katya, would you please..." - Confused, he turned and walked away! - You should've cut his face! Strangulated him! Months and months he should've been in pain. On his face! Here! Here it is! - Too bad to do that man. - I've not done anything. - You intended? - I intended! Cheers! Aunt Masha Artyomova was here. She left the keys. - Where did she go? - To village, asked to look after the bird. - Long time? - She said three weeks. - I need to see the her place. - Where is it? There... Top... Wait for me! I'll be back. Grandpa, food would get cold! - Good morning, Ivan Thedorovitch! - Good morning. Oh! Innokentyij! Innokentyij, don't you remember me? Innokentyij... Don't open up to anybody! You understand? Grandpa, why did you wear these clothes? For Moscow! I think this would be taken as a railwayman's hat? Let me change it. Better. Jailbird! And why d'you take the rake? Those who want to learn... young girl. Grandpa, what's in your head? You've changed but I don't know in what direction? Right direction, Katya, a better direction. It's too late to change at my age. Grandpa! Why're you going to Moscow? To lodge a complaint! What is it? Gas. - What? - Gas. You take it. As a veteran, I'll give you a discount. The dogs are everywhere. What you need is, may be a gun? Howitzer... Perhaps a shotgun. You decided to be a murderer? You can be a real one daddy. Close your big mouth or a fly might get swallowed. Look at what television is doing to the old people these days. Tata, he deals in weapons. I need one. I am interested. So let's go. Let's go. I warn you in advance... - I don't have the money.... - And where is it? Write the address? Or remember? - Here? - Yeah. He needs you, Tata. Hi. I'm Tata, who must whip? You young people should whip. I shall rifle. Sound of the shot has a language. - Have you heard any? - I had to be lucky. Dry and sharp sound powerful than a lash. - So I am to whip? I don't thinks so. - Why? - I go hunting... - And what do you see? That's personal. I do no damage. Cool! Then how do you know the kind you want? - I do watch TV. - It's true! What about the catridges then? - What about cartridges? - Isn't he a fast learner? I would need 20 of them. Why so many? To make stew. Profit margin is high. You understand? Yes... And the legal implications? Where you've seen those? All are meant for offices and departments. Try to give them money. How much worth they are any how? Money can buy anyone and anything. I have already bought them all. Now, blindfold, Tata, I'm sorry. He shouldn't see no trace? You mind? No. Its fine. - Here we reach? - Yeah, right. These are very ordinary. Small, as I see, you don't need that. And this? This is a nice structure. Altered SZVU. - Silencer? - No, only a flash. But no, boys! I need a silencer! What kind of customers do we have these day? What? Well, all right. There is a special product. - The client did not come for it. - Well, show! Sura, bring! But it will be expensive by one and a half thousand. - Only for you as a veteran. - As a participant of the great war. Oh-oh! Ah, a silencer? Silencer. - The distance? - Not bad for you guy! If you are not drunk, can hit a matchbox from 300 meters. - You ready? - Yeah. No, it will not be that good. Feel and place the finger like a petal. A suggestion from the top guy. You don't breathe as you do otherwise. Then catch the moment between two heartbeats. Ready? Ready... Come on. You are a good shooter. He is a perfect shooter. - What kind of cartridges are you taking? - What are they? Traditional and very effective. That's it. - You said you don't want no damage. - I've changed my mind. How many do you need? Give me ten. Need a reserve? All my life I live in reserves. Anything can happen. Matches, kerosene, bread. Now, the thing has come down to ammunition. Oh, my God! - Hello, Vanya. - Hello. - Hey, is there anyone alive? - Grandpa! Grandpa! My dear! - Hello. - Oh, Daddy! What a coat! Just as H?pelyhecske. - David. - Good morning. But Dad, what is it? Come change. - Remove it. - Good. Come here, sweetheart. Forget it, Katyusa, forget it. As if nothing has happened. You know, if I... David, shut your ears! If you remember all the villain in my life, including your own papa too! I'd have been mad. Katyusa... Katyunya. I don't wanna be a mother. We men, would have been killed long ago if had learned to avoid a woman. Certainly, when the money was taken to Warsaw, you got away. You'd better listen! I'm going to talk to the grandfather. The man's guilty. Yeah, yeah... - Somehow, I felt it first. - What? Why the house should be sold so cheap? - Why put down a glass of Scotch. - Come on, girl, go. Father! You must give the money to me now, Dad. Investment time is good. He should be replaced. David will be gone soon. - He should be replaced. - Well! The next husband... he should be in the kindergarten? - Okay, okay, Dad! - How come you always choose such kids? If you don't have anything good in the mountains, why should you? Why? But, Dad! The bags! They need to be carried on. He was the right one, not some drunken bastard. Excuse me, I need the money badly. I have no money! How's that? The heir receives half the money according to the law. - The law. - Yes. I have no money! Spent. It's not possible, Gambled? Spent in striptease bars the same money? Listen, you foolish profiteer! Shut up! David don't get into this. My father is an old man, the old thinking. - Damn fool! - Oh, all right. What is it Dad? Your daughter is just surviving. You remember only money! And all the guys. You were never like that. Olja. K?ty?n? has to be looked after in a much better way. You returned money to the Colonel. - Which Colonel? - Pasutyint?l. He wanted to pay for his son's deed. Oh! Na-na-na. What are you doing? - Get out of here! - Dad! Bust it. Come on, Dad! My daughter! - Grandpa, How do you feel? - I'm fine. I'm fine. Always hide things from me. Oh! Don't be afraid, I wont die. I must not die. - Hi, Fjodorics! - Hi. - Hi, Fjodorics! - Oh, hi Fjodorics, sit down. - Look afresh, Szlavka? Fjodorics you are back to the major sport? Come on. A serious sport. Now I'm just a fan. Not a supporter but you should be a coach. Wednesday... There are the boys! They drink, scream, merry. A big pain. They seems already drunk. The bastion and the leader of the horse. The stronger leader. - Check! - What d'you think, Fjodorics? The non-lethal chess. Log in to the king. Over here! Faster! What happened? Something silly. It looks like a champagne bottle exploded. And broke the eggs? Grandpa, what's wrong with you? I'm tired. What is the noise in the street? I saw something. Today, the forgotten thing. Ready-war. I just do not understand, who fights with whom. Who called the ambulance? - A sympathiser. - Which one? Who knows. Zvariginhez? I did not know their names and I don't want to know. - What happened? - We told that. - I ask, what happened? - Champagne. - And it was blown up? - Yes. Where was he sitting? Here. - Heard sound of any weapon? - You mean a gun? - Well, grenades, fireworks. - No. Maybe there was something in his pocket? No, he was in his underwear. Yes, It was warm, he was in his underwear. What are you looking at? I want to understand what happened here! - Is it possible that there were strangers here? - No. - And you guys? - What about we guys? Today is Wednesday. So what? We have'nt done anything. Well, they say he can no longer be helped and must be castrated. But to save you all I need to know what happened here. - Saving? - What? Right then I want to find out. - Who is this? - No idea. - Waiting for someone? - No, incorrect. Sit down! I am Vagyok. - You like it? - Very Come on. They've been waiting. - And where these young men are? - There'll be enough to work without them. Hello! - Hi, Fjodorics! - Hi. Hello. Listen, I have an idea Prepate a letter for the General Prosecutor's Office. - What is it? - Contact the Public Prosecutor. Ah... All right, all right. Thank you. Where have you been? Whenever I look for you, you're not found. Traveling. May be America. The elderly don't do anything but travel. Worms... Now, you! Have questions? None. Enough has been written on each point well. Although not every comma has been checked. The thing is, you are stupid and miserable. The expert says about a bullet. You know that kid. Bullet. And your friend is off his testicals. Let's start with the less important. Where is the gun? I've already answered this question. If you do not believe me, start the investigation. Let's beat the confession out of me, the usual thing. Let me write the report, send the dogs for traces. - Get out of here! - What? Thus, this is guys... ...well, such is the life. - Look, Look! - Wow! That's a car! Yes... because they are the new Russians? - What's the problem? - Well, its a new car. I saved to buy a new one. Listen! Let me have a round, right? - Did'nt I Wash the engine? - You are washed out Pupa! Such an imported car stops in the street, and it is full of weapons. - What happened? - How do I know what went wrong? - Is it possible to have bombs in it? - Oh, crap. Bomb? You really like the child talks. Grandpa, are you home? - Imagine what's happening in the yard! - What's happening? - Did you hear? - No. Throughout the day sat in the bathroom? Thus, the whole life goes by. What were you looking for in the car? You inquired about your friend's health? Burned a little bit. - But he is back to his senses. - Which part of the body got hurt? - The back. The bottom. - And the testicals. It's good to see you talk like that. - Do you want me to tell you a secret? - Sure! You're the next one. I don't understand. You understand everything. You understand everything. The life can be gone or perhaps shortened... - ...of course, if you have much luck. - And if I'm not being lucky? You'd be buried. You don't think it can be a coincidence? Twice the bullet has hit the target. What does Igor say? You can read the experts' opinion. You see nothing, you understand nothing because of reduced mental ability. It is clearly written: the bullet. Bullet! What's this all about? - Number of lines reach just one place. - Where? Remember the kin of the victim. He is really hard because he wants to pay-off. Clever boy! All these things. And now you will be hard to hit. Does he wants to shoot through the window? He is not going to shoot through the window. I can see quite a large variation. What do you want to find out from me? - What day is today? - Wednesday. Accidents also occurred on Wednesdays. And today is Wednesday. Such kind of punishment for a little fun we had on a Wednesday. Two of them have already received it. Well received with pure heart! For you, I see the end of the deserts. - What should I do? - You should run. Run. Look no back. Thank you, Dad. Oh, I understand. Next Wednesday, I'll call your mother. Why, you call her? Lawyer, cop, doctor, nurse. Everyone but not your mother? Because of the immense overconfidence you will soon break down. - The old man is home? - No. - All right, then I look later. - No come on in! - How are you? Looking good. - Thank you. - Where is he - traveling? - He went to the store. So he'll be here soon. I see. - Why is electricity meter running fast? - We are'nt saving. - Apparently, this isn't yours. - Aunt Masha's. - Where does she live? - The 14's house. - Your aunt? - Yeah. - Where is she? - Gone to her village. She always leaves the keys here. - Coming back soon? She said three weeks. I see. Give me some water to drink! - Stay on. - 20 minutes before I leave. Thank you. Take care. Interesting, interesting. So the house is sold. Interesting. I have some traces remaining of the crime. Ivan Ivanovich, you send me two guys? Reliable ones. - No problem. Five minutes later. - Good. - The owner will object? - The owner is an old man. - Pensioners are often nervous. - Is that the case? What are we looking for? Weapons, documents, drugs? Well, if I find them, I'm not going to protest. Actually, the weapons are involved. Cartridges, shells... ...and there is a gun. Stand up, please. Grandpa, what are they looking for? The proofs. Thier minds are lost. This is what? Huh? What is this? A piece of paper. This isn't a piece of paper. This is a page of the calendar found in the trash bucket. - So what? - What is the signal? - A cross. - What does it mean? It means the cross. Reason... Police! Robbers in the house! Liberty Square... You think that way? You are to think that way sir? Take care to avoid mistakes! I don't make a mistake. Calm down, guys. Leave me, I'll take care. Ivan Thedorovitch, here? - Hi. - Excuse me, you are...? - Artyomova. Maria. - What are you looking for? - The keys are needed. - What keys? - The house keys. - What kind of house? Of my apartment. I left here. Where are her keys? - What keys? - This woman's apartment keys. Comrade Colonel, it is possible that these are the ones. - Madam, these are your keys? - Yes, they are mine. Come on, guys. And you, sir, too. Soldiers, look! Oh, Why go this way? This is shorter. Excuse me. - What happened? - I'm going to see. Well, this was the man! Ideally sector shot. Clean. Good look? Nothing is violated Comrade Colonel. You're the one. I know it's you. Listen well, you vengeful man! - If something happens to my son... - Too late. What is late? It is too late to remember. It's done... What? What did you say? What did you say? Move! Of course, that happened... Once they became rapist, I'd been to them. But then - what is happening here? I also want to know... The devil you know! Son, son, my son! Son! My son! Comrade Colonel! What are you doing, comrade Colonel? Relax, take it easy. Yes... Come, real fast. Injuries caused by firearms. Liberty Square 12, 4th flat. Yes... and a psychiatrist too. Somebody looks too confused. Fjodorics! Come on. - Me? - Yes, you. - What? - Not so good, Ivan Fjodorics. I am not good? It is not a good tool if it falls. Then, what tool must you have? I have a house in the village. The only way to take rid of things. This is life. And it isn't possible to have one without a tool. And there can never be one. I can see that. Its over, Ivan Fjodorovics. This shall be a final and there won't be no appeal. Liberated now. Free! And to live? Free. Thank you, Aljosa. Fjodorics! What's wrong with you, let it go. Stay away please. - Fjodorics, let me embrace you. - Leave me alone, you! - Fjodorics, at least shake hands tightly. - That's too much scarlet. You stink. - So here you are. - Slavic... Frozen again, everything here in this morning. The door did not creak, no flicker has been there in the fire... Somewhere in the street can be heard the sound of lonely harmonica... Somewhere in the street can be heard the sound of lonely harmonica... There are the fields beyond the gates, where he turns around and returns again... As if looking for someone in the dark, no one has been found...
