Open wide, Brooke. Wider. You know I don't want you anymore. I didn't, I didn't do that. A stranger. A stranger, doctor? I can remember those awful things I did, but for the life of me, doctor, I don't know the man who did them. This stranger, this evil Dr. Feinstone, where is he now? Gone. Consumed by the rage that spawned him. By that, you mean it's over? You've put your anger at your wife's infidelity behind you? No, doctor, it is not over. It will never be over. Every second of every day, asleep or awake, I see her face in the faces of all of my victims. You refer to them as your victims, even though you say you don't know the stranger who hurt them. He is me. lam him. Still, he remains. Until love returns, the soft whisper of his voice, searching, wanting, that which he hath given with no reply. He is gone? He is under control. Shall we go? Dr. Alec Feinstone, the notorious psycho dentist, broke out of the state mental facility at lndio yesterday afternoon. His hostage, psychiatrist Dr. Genevieve Cussler... You think before the doc went postal, he was salting money away from you and the IRS? From you, God, his devoted wife and helpmate? Excuse my bad manners, but did he do that to you? Cut your tongue out? What a world, huh? These are all his, huh? Souvenirs from a trip he took as a kid. South Dakota. Nebraska. Missouri. Missouri. Yeah. Jeez, you look at these snow domes. Set of safety deposit box keys. The answer's in the postcards, huh? All right. They found the shrink's car abandoned in Flagstaff. Along with the 700 or so bucks from her wallet, jeez, he could be just about anywhere. Bye now. Thank you. Hey. Hi, Mr. Wilkes? Well, I'll be. Larry Caine, come on in. How the hell long has it been, five years? God, it's good to see you. To what do we owe this great pleasure? Rush hour traffic. Does that come with an explanation? Well, my car overheated on the Alexandria bridge. It was the morning rush hour. That was it. I couldn't face another yawing mouth, another bicuspid, and I was weary of my life, of the city, and the moral decay that passes as sophistication. Felt like that myself some clays. I left my car right there on the bridge, I walked home, I called my lawyer, and long story short, here I am. Small town, honest people, clean living, but I got me a little problem, old buddy. Yeah, Jeremy? Say, Bev, see if you can get Harry and his drill over here toot sweet. Dr. Caine has lost the key to his safety deposit box. All right)!- Well, it's a little irregular, but here it is. Thanks. What are your plans, Larry? Oh, to live in Paradise. Oh, great golf just outside of town. Eh, I detest golf. Eh, we'll change that. Where you staying? Paradise Motel. The hell you are. Ah, yes. Jamie? Jamie, have you rented the cottage? No, not yet. There's someone I want you to meet. Come with me. Larry? Yeah, right with you. Jamie Devers, Dr. Lawrence Caine. Nice to meet you. - Hi. Yes, Jeremy tells me that you're his favorite niece. I'm his only niece. Larry's just moved here to Paradise, lock, stock and barrel, from that eastern den of inequity, Washington, D.C. Actually, I left the lock, stock and barrel behind. You've got the empty cottage. I thought maybe you could show it to Larry during lunch. It's really small. Well, it's just me. This was my parents' house. It's where I grew up, and there's the cottage. I'll take it. No. No. You having trouble sleeping, doc? I sure would if I were you. Go away. Go away. When it comes right down to it, a Caine is just a Feinstone, and we all know what a Feinstone is, don't we? Do it. Do it. Yes, bleed. Hello? Larry? Larry? I came running over. I was worried. It was... I came running over here because I heard this loud noise. I didn't know what to think. Unfamiliar surroundings, and I must have bumped into the dresser on my way to the bathroom, and I can replace it. Don't worry about it. I can make another one. You made it? - Yeah. Here. Let me, let me do that. - You sure? Yeah. A little housework always relaxes me. Do you do windows? As a matter of fact, I do. Good. I think we're going to get along just fine, then. Goodnight. - Goodnight. In town, the, I think it's called the Paradise Café, is it any good? After graduate school in Seattle and a few lost years contemplating the meaning of art in a world that was consumed by commercialism, I came to the realization that actually creating my pottery was more important than thinking about it, and so, here I am, back in Paradise, bank teller by day, artist by night. Chicken fried steak for the gentleman. Spinach salad for Jamie. No wonder you stay so thin, darling. Anything else? Something wrong, sir? No, no. I was, I was just contemplating a side of curly fries. I've decided against it, thank you. Well, enjoy your dinner, folks. Thanks. You're fleeing reality in search of a dream, and I'm fleeing a dream in search of reality. What dream are you fleeing from? My wife was a former Mrs. Maryland, thus we were the perfect couple for the perfect dinner party. You fled from that? Did I mention that the former Mrs. Maryland was attending other parties without me, in the afternoons, thrown by the younger male members of the foreign diplomatic corps? Yet, still, he remains. Until love returns, the soft whisper of his voice Wanting, searching, that which he has given without return. To Paradise. May we both find here what we're looking for. Larry, you okay? Larry, what's wrong? I lost a cap. Look, one of my caps has come loose. We didn't put that in. Yes, I know, but I'd like the doctor to re-cement it, please. Fill this out. Don't do it. Don't. Don't do it. Oh, God. Oh, that's good. Send in the next patient, please. Please have a seat. This won't hurt a bit. You ever been drilled on before? Would you like some gas? Open wide. Wider. You have to stop moving. If you move, I cannot proceed. Why are you moving? Why is everything moving? Please, sit down. Sit still. You're moving. Everything is moving. You've got to sit still. Please. Somebody. Doctor's office. Oh, no, Mrs. Sanderson, put him in for when? Friday, 10:00 AM. Oh, how's Harold? Oh, sorry to hear that. Hope he feels better soon. All right. We'll see you Friday. Bye. Hey. What are you doing with my patient? Remove this cotton from your mouth, ma'am, so you don't choke. What's going on here? What, my... Here, relax a minute, dear, while I just take this out. Oh, Bernice, look after Edna there. Who the hell do you think you are? That woman was in respiratory distress. Respiratory distress? ...doctor... traveling the country, saving poor souls from respiratory distress? I am a dentist. Well, then, you should know better than to be poking around in another dentist's business. Yeah. Are you going to wash your hands? How bout some gloves? Bernice, would you bring me a box of gloves? I'd appreciate it if you'd sterilize your instruments one more time. Anything else, doctor? Perhaps the equipment is too old for your liking, or maybe you miss the music? That it? You like a little elevator music with your dentistry? How bout some Lysol under the cabinets? Yeah, yeah. You sure you want me to put in your cap? You're the only game in town. Yes, I am. Okay. Open UP- There we go. This is a country practice, doctor. Granted, it's plain and simple, but the folks around here seem to like it just fine, so I'd be obliged, city boy, if you'd keep your opinions to yourself, and your fingers out of my patients' mouths. God. Asshole. Cretin. Burns. Burns. You ain't competent, buffoon. What are you doing here? Look at this. What'd you use, library paste? You call yourself a dentist? You stay away from me. Bernice. Bernice. Oh, Bernice is out to lunch, more ways than one. Fill them, fill them, fill them. That's your philosophy, huh? You know, you and your ilk, Dr. Burns, have made dentists the boogeymen of medicine, something to be feared, to be avoided at all costs. I've worked my entire career to change all that. You see, a trip to the dentist should be pleasant, something to look forward to. That is, of course, if the dentist in question is competent. It's not the cap. You're a fruitcake. Funny you should mention that. You're scaring me. I'm trying to. Now, repeat after me. "L am an incompetent dentist." Say it. I am an incompetent dentist. Now, "I..." - I... "Am..." - Am... "A..." - A... "Boogeyman." I can deal with this. Your call is being answered by a machine. Please leave a message. Love and kisses from your favorite private eye. I'm in Grand Junction, Colorado. No luck so far. Next stop is North Platte, Nebraska. UP With people! Ciao, baby. Too bad about Doc Burns, isn't it? Yes. Yes, it is. Too bad for Paradise. The answer is no, Jeremy. Didn't get where I am by accepting no for an answer. Hey, buddy, I have a responsibility. What kind of town would this be without a dentist? You won't even consider it? - No. Eh, just til we find somebody. What part of no don't you understand, Jeremy? I did not give up a lucrative practice in Washington to start from scratch somewhere else. A sweet deal for somebody. House, practice, everything for a song. Promise me you'll at least think it over. Afternoon, doctor. Let me show you around. Ask me, a little spackle, fresh coat of paint, maybe some new carpeting, you've got yourself one fine little office here. Come on in, city boy. I'm going to Dr. Caine Feinstone the bitch. No. No. No. No. Hey. You're home early. I wasn't feeling well. What's wrong? Little toothache. It's nothing. I have an appointment Saturday with Dr. Davis over in Otis. 70 miles away. May I look at it? All right. All right. You want to open for me? Feinstone her, Dr. Caine Feinstone the bitch. Are you okay, Larry? I'm fine. Just open, open wide, Jamie. Sensitive? All right. It's nothing serious. You just have a, you have a small cavity right at the gumline, and I think that it's best if we fill it. Is it going to hurt? Shouldn't. Want to open wide? All right, turn your head a little this way. Okay. That's it? I didn't even feel it. You're not supposed to. Are you okay, Larry? I'm going to have to change this bur. Fehstone her, Dr. Came. Feinstone the bitch. I am not crazy. I am not going to hurt her. Is there anything wrong? No, no, I'm fine. I'm just cleaning the instruments. Be right with you. Why's it so scary to come to the dentist? Doesn't have to be. All right. I will have you fixed up in no time. Ready? I did it. I did it. I'm a dentist. I am the best damn dentist there ever was. Well, are you excited? Excited? Yes, I think I am. Well, the people of Paradise thank you, Larry. Lawrence. Hey, hey, picture time. Oh, yeah. Jeremy. No, I just want Larry in front of the sign. He's the man of the hour. Boo. You know, I could fix that. Oh, I'm used to it. Whenever you're ready. Jamie, let me show you the house. - Okay. Now, I haven't really changed the structure. I mean, the layout is pretty much the same. That's what I don't want. Wow. This is nice. You've done wonders. I believe a harmonious environment is essential to the dental experience. Well, this one is just perfect. Perfect? Oh, not quite. I'm reserving that for the operatory that I'm creating upstairs. Coming up. Watch the back. Well, I can't wait to see it. You'll be the first. Ah, well, my first patient. You look really nice. All right. See you. - Okay. Just a small country practice. I think I'm going to like it here. I've got a feeling he's going to be real good for this town. Hello? Hi, Jamie. You still hard at work? Well, I'm about ready to quit for the night. How's the filing coming? Well, at this rate, I should be done somewhere around the millennium. That bad? Worse. Anyway, I just called to say hi. Hi. Hi. I'll talk to you tomorrow, huh? Okay. - Bye bye. - Bye- Dr. Came'? - Yes. Oh, am I glad to see you. The cab jockey thought you might be working late. I thought I'd give it a shot. My damn tooth is killing me. Come in. Oh, you're a ha“ of Tamer, doc, a ha“ of iamer. Do you think when we're finished, you could give me a ride to the bus stop? I've got to catch the 10:40 to KC. A ride? I am a dentist, not a cab jockey. You know, the motel guy said the only dentist in town was dead. I had to track you down. You're kind of flying under the radar, doc. Kind of like stealth dentist. Well, sir, you found me. I guess tonight's my lucky night. Well, we'll see. You know, I'm from the left coast, L.A. Lala land. Swimming pools, movie stars, boob jobs. I'm on way way to KC. I'm thinking about doing a little real estate speculating. My rental car broke down, and they started to hassle me about it. I told them to shove it. You know, I'll just take the bus. Have you ever been to L.A., doc? Have we ever met before? God, I swear, you look familiar. Better open your mouth, sir. You have a bus to catch. I'm terrible with names, but I never forget a face. Hold still. Doc, that hurts like a bitch. You're not going in there dry, are you, doc? I mean, I'm not anti-narcotics. I'll administer an anesthetic. Good. Hey, you know, just last year, I picked out a guy at Dodger Stadium two sections over. I knew I knew this guy from somewhere, but I just didn't know where, and then it hit me. St. Paul, 1983, footwear expo, floor shine booth. I went over and checked it out. It was him. I never forget a face. Have you ever been at Dodger Stadium, doc? No, that's not it, but don't tell me. Don't tell me. It's coming. You're definitely southern California. I detest baseball. I'm never wrong, doc. - Could you please sit still? Have you ever been to L.A. doc? I swear you look familiar. Never forget a face. Oh, I'm never wrong, doc, never. You're definitely southern California. You did that on purpose. I know you. Fishbein, or Feinbein. Feinberg, the crazy dentist. Sir, sit back down. I cannot leave that tooth untreated. I took an oath. Get out of the doorway, nutball. This crazy dentist of yours, this Feinstone, would he get out of the doorway? I'm sorry, man. I got to go. You still want that ride? No. No, I'm a walker. Ah, you just couldn't have your toothache someplace else, could you? Insane, deranged, demented, psychotic, nuts, nutso, nutcase, nutball, loco, loony, apeshit, whacko. Oh, I didn't want to do it. I didn't want to do it. I tried not to. I tried not to do it. Okay. Okay. I'm going to make this work. I am going to make this work. I will make this work. I am in control. I am in control. I am not crazy. I am not crazy. I am not insane. I am not a monster. Hello, there. It's me. Hey, how you doing? I'll betcha you'll never guess where I'm off to next. Paradise, Missouri. Paradise, can you believe it? See you later. Back off, Bev. I know. I just can't get this image out of my head. I keep imagining you in this canoe with this handsome, mysterious stranger, rushing down a raging river, waterfalls, boulders, whitewater, and he's the only one with a life preserver. You're an alarmist. No, I prefer to see myself as a cynic, and the cynic in me says that the... Hey- - Hey- Hey, Jamie, how are you? - I haven't seen you in a week. Yeah, I got a job over in Otis. I was staying with my cousin. L got to go- Bye. I hear you rented your cottage to the new dentist. Mm-hmm, Dr. Came. What do you think of him? He's nice. Hey, I'm scheduled to do some work in his office. He's not coming between us, is he? No. Oh, God, Robbie, you're not going to propose again, are you? Jamie Devers, will you marry me? No. No? Why? Because I like you too much. No, not again. Enjoy your blueberry pie, sir. - Ah, blueberry. You got a minute, sweetheart? I can give you a second. Just figured you were the type that would help out a fellow human being, that's all. Give me a break. I saw a guy in town today who looked like an old army buddy. Maybe you could help me track him down. I'm staying right at the edge of town, in the Sleep Easy Motel, if you Hey, Bev, there's a little guy at the end of the counter, seems real interested in Doc Caine, asking all sorts of questions. Thinks he knows him from the service or something, from L.A. What little guy? You'd be surprised how people neglect their teeth. If everybody were only as diligent as you, Margaret. Some people never learn. Oh, I'm sorry. Jeremy needs you to sign these. Hi, Jamie. I'll be done with Margaret in just a moment. Hey, Margaret. - Hey. I saw you earlier. Where? Oh, in town, by the café, with some guy. Robbie? Robbie, is that his name? Robbie, well, you didn't tell me about Robbie, did you? There's nothing to tell. There's nothing to tell. That's not what it looked like from where I was sitting. He a good kisser? Did you see the part when he was on bended knee proposing to me? Proposing? Yeah, it's a joke. I mean, he does this every month. He proposes every month. It's a joke. Spit, Margaret. Robbie is one of my oldest and dearest friends. I mean, I've known him since I was in third grade. Little kids, babies. Friends. I mean, that's all it is. That's all it ever will be. Friends'? Friends. Just friends? Oh, God. Excuse me. Hello? Yeah, I'm with a patient, could you please Would you stop? Hey. Hey, hey. Hey. Hey. I'm with a patient right now, if you could just give me 15 minutes or so. Yeah, in case you haven't put it together, I'm the jerk who cut you off the other day in town, and anyway, I'm sorry. Hey, no problem, man. I'm Robbie Mauro. I'm your drywall guy. Aren't you living in Jamie's cottage? Yeah, yeah, that's right. She's spoken of you. Yeah? About how you've been friends since you were children. I've been in love with Jamie since the third grade. Third grade, huh? How about Jamie? Oh, she's in love with me, she just doesn't know it. Oh! yeah? I'm terribly sorry. I didn't know it was loaded. Gotcha. He doesn't exist. What are you talking about? Larry Caine. He has no credit history. I checked and rechecked. The man is a blank. He was somebody else before he came to Paradise. Bev, this is nonsense. No, no, there was a guy at the cafe. He said he was sure he knew him from Los Angeles, Jeremy, not Washington. Larry Caine is a valued customer of our bank, and an asset to our town. I think you've been reading too many murder mysteries, Bev. Well, he could be one of those Medicare fraud doctors you see ducking behind doors on 60 Minutes. Thank you, Bev. Dammit, Jeremy, he could be married with a wife and kids. Thank you, Mrs. Walls. Bank of Paradise, this is Jamie. Jamie, hi. - Hi. Listen, I'm standing outside the office on the grounds here, and I've been thinking about you all day, and I was hoping you'd do me the honor ofjoining me for dinner tonight at the most exclusive restaurant in town. No, not the Paradise Café. Something much better than that. Hi. - Hi. You look great. - You, too. I love my dress, but how did you know my size? Perfect only comes in one size. Where are we going? Oh, Larry, I just love what you've done out here. Under the stars, in the dark of night, silence the... and give love its flight. Stay. Stay right here. Don't move. I should put these in water. They'll keep. No, they won't. I'll bring you more tomorrow. I want these. Don't answer that. Answer what? Hey, Jamie. I guess you're not in. Look, my cousin Louis and his wife are going to be in town Friday. I figured wouldn't it be cool maybe you and me have dinner with them, you being my future wife and all? It'll be fun. Oh, yeah, this is Robbie. Seriously, Jamie, I'd like to see you more. Can't seem to get that Thanksgiving out of my head. Let's go in my room, Larry. You know the one. Anyway, let me know. Bye. Your oldest, dearest friend is in love with you, Jamie. No, he's not. Mister Drywall is in love with you. How do you feel about him, Jamie? I told you how I feel about him. You didn't tell me about that very special Thanksgiving, though, did you? I had just... Larry, I lost both of my parents in less than six months. I just... And? And what? I was invited over to a friend's house for Thanksgiving dinner. I mean, Robbie was there. I was just lonely. Larry, it mean nothing. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, it meant something. Believe me, it meant something. You don't get it. Oh, I get it. Believe me, I get it. Would you stop cleaning my kitchen? I'm sorry. Just can't get enough of those blue collar types, can you? Goes by the name of Caine. The twelfth one is with him. In review of our membership, he couldn't be Dr. Caine. Hello. Doctor's office. Who is it? It's Bev from the bank. She wants an appointment for this afternoon. Is that all right? Yeah. That'll be fine, Bev. 4:30? Any other calls? Jamie? No. Desert Storm? The Gulf War was over in 1991. That would make this magazine what, Bernice? The answer is, out of date. This is an out of date magazine. How many times did I tell you to get rid of all of these? Here. Want me to help you? I think I'd better go. Where you going? Fact finding mission. Don't forget about tonight. Oh, I'll be there with bells on. Bernice. Dr. Caine? Hello? Thanks for being on time, Bev. Oh, jeez. I wasn't snooping. I just wanted to look at my file, really. I've wanted to look at my file since I was a kid. Sanderson, Emile. Your file's inside. First time I peeked in my files, I was in college. Now, to more important things. This discolored tooth of yours. Oh, it's been that way since junior high. Well, it should've been taken care of. Lean forward. Let's have a look, shall we? Open wide for me. Smile. Big smile. You know, as long as we're bonding your incisor, that's that discolored tooth, we could do all your teeth, make them a few shades lighter, give you that Hollywood smile. All of them? You think? I'd just like them whiter without anybody noticing that I did anything, if that's possible. Anything is possible. Open. You ever been to Hollywood, Larry? I went to Washington, D.C. once. I bet you miss it, Washington, home. I mean, it's exciting. It's our nation's capital. Funny. What's that, Bev? There was this guy, passed through town day before yesterday. He said he was sure he knew you from Los Angeles, but that couldn't be, you being from D.C. and all. No. No, it couldn't, could it, Bev? Well, he was grilling Shawna at the café. A little guy, she said. Oh, this little guy, does he have a name? I don't know. Let's see what you do know. What are you doing? What are you doing? No. Breathe, Bev. Breathe. Breathe. Yeah. Wake up, Bev. It's time to go to school. Five more minutes, Daddy. What? Oh my God. What? Oh my God. Larry. Larry, you can't do this. What? Bond your teeth? Please let me go, Larry. Please let me go. This is how we bond our teeth in Hollywood, Bevvi. Bonding in bondage. It's all the rage. Please don't hurt me, Larry. Oh, sure. You come in here under false pretenses, you nose through my files, then you sit there asking all your little wheedling questions, and then you beg me not to hurt you? What world do you live in, Bevvi? There. Now the nerve's exposed and we can commence with a little game, a lie detector test, if you will. I'll ask a question, you answer it. If you tell the truth, I'll pat your head. If you lie, I shall do this. Good. I think you get it. Now, the first question is, what do you know about me? I only know what everybody else knows. Oh, Bev. Wrong answer. Now, the question was, exactly what do you know about me? I know that you're not really Dr. Lawrence Caine. That I'm not really Dr. Lawrence Caine? You were somebody else six years ago. Good. Good. Now, next question. Why all those clumsy questions about Washington? I didn't think you lived in Washington. You didn't think I lived in Washington. Good. Good, Bev. Do you know who I was before I was Dr. Lawrence Caine? No. No. - No? Wrong answer. Somebody help me. Somebody help me. Somebody help me. If you say a word, if you utter a sound while I'm gone, I will cut out your vocal cords with this? Do you understand? Robbie, what can I do for you? I got the last of the drywall here. Well, I'm with a patient right now. Bev? I noticed her car was out there. Yes. We're bonding. Help. Help me. Help. Novocaine must have worn off. Now, I'm going to have to ask you to stay outside. It's very important that... Robbie, don't... Bev. Robbie. Oh, Robbie. No. Bev, Bev, Bev. Here we go, two pals, playing a friendly little game. The minute I turn my back, you cheat. Get off me. Get off me. Get off me. New game, Bevvi. Truth or tooth. What did you tell Jeremy about Washington? I didn't tell. I didn't tell. Your discolored tooth was a problem. Not a problem anymore. Well, I can see that you floss regularly, Bev. I like that. Now, Jamie. What did you tell Jamie? I, uh... Yeah? Are you sure? I, uh... Oh, Bev. You liar. Ah, dammit, I broke it. Darn. This is the part I hate. I don't mind telling you, Bevvi, pulling teeth is like, well, pulling teeth. You're looking much better already. Would you give me back my drill? Okay. I got a much better idea, much better idea. Oh, Bev, you're going to love this. We'll cut it out. The doctor isn't in right now. Please leave a message. It's me. You can speak? Both of us overreacted last night, and I'm sorry if I said anything that hurt you. That wasn't my intention. - It's too late for apologies. I'm almost at your office. You think I wanted to do that to you? I'm coming for the twelfth rose. I worshiped you, but then I saw you with him, in your mouth. I couldn't let you keep your tongue, not after that. Larry? Oh my God. Stop it. Stop. That was weird. Who is she? It gets confusing at times, Brooke. I think I should call the police. Larry? Larry. Through all the drama, whether damned or not, love gilds the scene, and women drive the plot. Come here. No! Come here. No. Let go. Damn cap just won't stay in. Jamie. Jamie. Jamie. Jamie. Are you in there? Jamie? I know you're in there. No. No. Jamie. Jamie? Open the door. Just a crack. You stay away from me. Jamie. Open the door. No. All right. Have it your way. Don't you see it, Jamie? We're joined at the hip. We're Rob and Lauren. We're peanut butter and jelly. We're Marge and Homer. We're green eggs and ham. We're corned beef and cabbage. No. No. Open wide, Jamie. No. There we are. Do you have any idea where you are? On the cutting edge, that's where. On the threshold of a new patient-friendly era of dentistry. Behold, the dental environment of the future. It's an empty room. It is not just an empty room. It is a total dental environment. Bathroom accident is the greatest cause of injury in the home. Wisdom teeth? You're here for your wisdom teeth? I had my wisdom teeth out years ago. Well, we'll just have to do a much better job this time, won't we? Open wide. You get away from me. Jamie? Brooke? Jamie, Brooke. Brooke. Oh, my Brooke. Jamie. I know you're behind there. Come out. Matilda. I'm not Matilda, and I'm not Brooke. Can I let you in on a little secret? Killing is liberating. You just might like it. I can kill you with this. What if it's not plugged in? What if it is? Small town girl, nice, honest, small town little girl. You're not going to pull the trigger. I'll tell you what. I'll give you to three, then I'm going to get you a new smile and start to have some real fun. One, two... Surprise! They're new. I just bought them. Jamie? I'm over here. Are you okay? Where is he? Oh, that damn tooth. Stop, no. Stop, no.
