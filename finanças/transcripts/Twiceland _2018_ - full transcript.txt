It was pretty on day 1 and 2 but today is extraordinary. Hi, ONCE. - Look. Beautiful. - Beautiful. - Pretty. - I love it. Coming up the stage for the opening the CANDYBONG touched my heart. I loved it. Here is something I saw. JIHYO was nervous yesterday and the day before but I saw JIHYO's face during 'Like OOH-AHH' and she had a big smile on her face. I'm really happy today. I'm sure you can see spring JIHYO even more upgraded. Before we get started, let us check your passion, youth and energy. Yeah, we will test the power of your youth. - Do we need to test that? - You know what I mean. Your voice is too small. ONCE on floor 1, 2, 3. Are you ready? When we say "ONCE" you say "Yeah~". Okay? We will start from "Standing, make some noise~" Then those at the standing seat will say yeah. One, two, three. Standing, make some noise! Not loud enough. Hold on, hold on. I think you are not real ONCE. This is not the voice of ONCE. I will give you another chance and you will bring real ONCE. Okay? TWICE, altogether. One, two, three. Standing, make some noise. Here you are. - Good. - ONCE is here. Floor 2, show us who you are. Second floor. - Second floor. - One, two, three. Make... Everyone. - Together on one, two, three. - Hey, hold on. Why do ONCE have to do a survival game? I don't like a survival game. Neither do I. - I really don't like a survival game. - They are all ONCE. It's not a survival game. We are practicing. - Remember our vocal training? - Yeah. - We sing Do, Re, Mi. - OK, OK. - But... - That's what it is. It's fun to watch a survival game, though. - I'm convinced. - Are you? So am I. Let's go for 'Floor 2, make some noise.' - Okay. - One, two, three. Floor 2, make some noise! - Floor 3, can you do this? - Cool. You have a long breath. Amazing second floor. This is it. ONCE's throat will hurt. You can stop now. We still have far more to go. - Save your voice. - We want to hear your voice for long time. Save your voice and it's your turn, 3rd floor. - I'm excited. - I can't wait to hear them. - Shall we begin? - We are back to the survival game. - This is a survival game. - But JEONGYEON. - Are you not excited? -IT am. Yeah? I can't wait to hear them. But ONCE becomes our team later. - Hurry up. - Floor 3. One, two, three. Floor 3, make some noise! Beautiful. OK, OK. Well done. Stop. Save your voice. Good, good. Hold on. Hold on. Wait. - It is not the event for the last day, is it? - Tell me. Is it? - ONCE, you've become together. - Fantastic ONCE. Why don't we try again for the last time? - Properly. - Everyone. - Let's say "ONCE, make some noise." - OK. One, two, three. ONCE, make some noise! Seriously... It's the last day of the concert. I feel the hottest and the most passionate atmosphere today. I love it. We prepared a lot this time. We are upgraded. So we want you not to miss even a small thing, okay? There are plenty of things to enjoy in TWICELAND. Everyone, we won't let you down. How was the opening performance? Wasn't it pretty? We saw the set during the rehearsal. Thank you for the beautiful stage. Thank you. Thank you so much. For this concert, so many... - What do we have to say? - Say what? - Staff? - Well.. - Staff. - St... What was it? - Staff. - No, no. - Staff, choreography team. - Choreography... What was that? - Parade? - Parade! - Why are you being so cute? - That's what I wanted to say. This, parade. Have you ever seen a parade at a concert? - Yeah? - Yes? I think I heard someone saying "yes." - Yes? - Who said "yes"? - Where did you see it? - No one? - There it is. - You saw it here? - I want to see a parade. - I thought we were the first. Everyone. This is TWICELAND ZONE 2 : Fantasy Park. We have pride, you know. Yeah, we have put all our efforts. - Yes. - Right. We are the only one who perform in the air like this. You will even see dolphins later. - Yes? - Yeah. Wait for it. Or you may see an elephant from there. Since it is the last day, everyone is being talkative. I'm getting worried about how to end this. Why don't we quickly move on to next stage? - I see. - Shall we? First of all, including the opening and the parade, we have livened up the mood with the cheerful songs. - Haven't we? - We have. So we'd like to give it a little change. Members, gather up. Slightly... The songs will be softer. We are having a set for the next song. Can you make a guess what song it will be? What do you think it is? - Many things are coming. - What? - 'Merry & Happy'. - We have 'Merry & Happy'. I think they decided to do all three concerts as ‘Merry & Happy'. - I think the snow here... - Maybe we should sing ‘Merry & Happy". I guess they want to listen to ‘Merry & Happy'. Let's sing ‘Merry & Happy". NAYEON, you sing for us. What song is it? This is it. Good. Sadly it is not ‘Merry & Happy" but we may have another song you want. Why don't we move on, then? And we want you to sway your CANDYBONG and sing along. Sing along, please. Let's go! - Let's go - Go, go! I'm hearing almost a legendary cheering of ONCE but we still have far more to go. Are you ready to have fun? I'm sure this song will be very new to you. Will you sing along? Let's get started. Let's go! - Wow, TWICELAND. - TWICELAND.

When it comes to me, ONCE will begin the wave from here. Heart wave, that's it! - Okay, then. - Heart wave, that's it! I got it. When JIHYO makes her heart, we go around. I'm not doing this if you ask me to do Aegyo. Pardon? I didn't say Aegyo. You want it? Yes, you do. - JIHYO wants Aegyo? - When JIHYO makes her heart... You drove me to do this even yesterday! No, please... No!!! No!!! Please... Please! Awesome. I didn't even say Ae this time. We promised whoever mentions Aegyo will do Aegyo. No, we didn't say like that yesterday. - JIHYO. - What were you going to ask me to do? I'm surprised that JIHYO wanted to do Aegyo by saying so. I want the wave. Hold on. What were you going to say? Tell me if you want to do Aegyo. Tell me what you were going to say. -I... - Tell me. I... - See? You wanted me to do Aegyo. - No! Then tell me. No. Go on. Listen, listen.

When you're done, you can lead them to start with 'Yay~' Turn around like this? Okay. I will do it. Just turn around? - So I just turn around? - Yes, and then Aegyo. Okay, let's get started. What is going on? Just one round? We are going to start the wave and we will see JIHYO's Aegyo at the end. Hold on. Let me tell you something. ONCE is getting bored. Hurry up. No need for your excuse! I don't want to hear you. Let's get started. Hurry up. Start! Hurry up! Start! Beautiful. Wow, amazing. You didn't get it. - You didn't get it. - I just didn't want to. Very tough. I heard many JYP family are here. I'm very embarrassed that one of my friends is here. No, no. - Just focus on ONCE only. - Yeah, we have a lot more ONCE here. Why am I doing this? - We all have to do it. - Because you misunderstood it. - Right. - Your fault. I thought you were going to make me do it because you always did. I... - Not at all. - I see. My fault. - Who! - Everyone! - It's a chaos today. - What 'everyone'? ONCE, these same patterns are not fun. Why don't we do it in line just like yesterday? - As ONCE wants. - Yeah. Straight line. - DAHYUN! - All members are doing it, then. It is not going to be over. What should we do? - What should we do? - Altogether, once. Yeah. - Let's do it at once. - Yeah, since it's the last day. - What should we do? - Can we just do it together?

Today... - It was on the script. - I found this as new one. I did Aegyo on day 1 - and I found Aegyo again on the script. - MI! MI! One, two, three. MI! MINA is going crazy. One, two, three. NA! NAAAA, I don't want to say good bye. This Aegyo is adorable. - So adorable. - Are you watching, everyone? My face turned red. Let's move onto the next song. Wait, I think I heard someone.

Let me wrap this up, everyone. The last song we prepared for you is a new song we have never performed before. Reaction... But sadly, we have to say good bye to you after this song.
