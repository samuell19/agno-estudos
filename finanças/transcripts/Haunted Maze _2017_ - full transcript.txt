- You better run real fast! - Connor! - As you all know, today is October 31st, which means happy Halloween! All right, guys, it's also Clancy's birthday today, so let's give him a big round of applause. Happy birthday, Clancy. All right, so the story of Halloween, you guys, pay attention, please. It was originally All Hallow's Eve, which was the day before All Saints' Day. Guys, I really need you to pay attention here. It was All Saints' Day. It's church festivities, which in Britain, they would, guys, guys! Please pay attention, all right? Now, All Hallow's Eve was a way of, more of a church festivity. It was about, it was about going out and celebrating the dead. Guys, guys, pay attention here, alright? Now we've got-- Please stop that! - Hey, hey! Stay right there, stay right there! I know who you are, okay? I'm just gonna take you and your staff down to the station, all right, come with me. Come with me. - Hi. I'm Detective Terry Cole. Would you like water? A soda? Oh, perhaps a cigarette? Before we get started, let's cover some basic ID information, and, um, what's your birth name? - Clancy Shrury Keller. - Do you have a nickname? - Well, it's ain't Clancy The Ballerina, now, is it? Clancy The Clown! - How did you get that nickname? - From a family business! We do what we do. I'm the clown. - How old were you when you first started working in the family business? - Now that's gettin' a might personal, don't ya think? - Where were you born? - Apple Creek, Indiana. - And your date of birth? - October 31st, 19-none of your business. - On Halloween? - We're all born on Halloween. - Coincidence? - Home deliveries. - All home deliveries? - Now, you're catchin' on real quick, Detective. - Okay, um, your, um, your home address? - We're a traveling carnival, Detective Cole. - So you're on the road all year? - I believe so. - Are you married? - Nope. - Do you have children? - Nope. - So, you're a traveling carnival. You, uh, offer rides and a haunted maze? - That is correct. I get paid to creep and greet the hell out of the public. - You creep and freak people out, in order to kill 'em, right? - This is Detective Edwards. - What are you saying, Detective Edwards? - We have footage of the haunted maze and surrounding areas from three different cameras. - Two detectives stare at the clown, frantically writing everything down, wasting valuable time pinning me to the crime, while the good people frown all over town. - Aren't you the clever one? - Some may say. - As of right now, seven teenagers are missing. One teen is in critical condition at Panama Hospital. - Your point? - Guilty is written all over this footage. Let's break this situation down. - Hey, wait, guys, we need a picture! - Yeah, okay, okay. - Say Halloween! - Halloween! - So going on Facebook! - Hey, let me check mine! - Not on my phone! - Seriously, it's such a good place. Don't embarrass me! Yeah, right. - Hey, guys, it's a quarter to nine. We should hop in line before the prices go up. - All right. - Let's go. - Did you see that clown? - Where? - Over there. That freakin' dang clown! - Where? - There he is again. Are you kidding me? - Creeper! - Antonio! - Don't embarrass me! - Alana. - Alana, Antonio's here, in the freaking flesh! - What? - Freaking flesh! - Seriously, stop! - Damn, he's gone! - Who? - That freaking clown! - What? - Why does it matter? - I hate clowns! - Hey, Muscles, what's your name? What's your name? - Scott. Hope you're not hurting our townspeople. - I can't pop your cherry , but I can make your banana cream. - Right here, Beth. - I don't even have my phone in this place. - Mine, too. - Snips of snails and slithering out snakes, that's what the boys are made of. How's your one-eye hanging? - You gonna show me what you're made of? - What the hell, country boy? What are you doing? - Can I at least get your number? - Did you guys see that crazy clown? - No. - No, where? - I'm serious. He was at the Tilt-A-Whirl, staring at everybody like really weirdly. - He's after you. - Stop, you know how clowns freak me out. It's not even funny. - Boo! - Jackass. - Hey, you guys want some food? - Barbecue potato chips! - Cake! - Soda! - Don't forget the ketchup. - And what were you bitching about? - What doesn't she bitch about? - No, you guys, I'm serious. I think this clown is stalking us. He's everywhere I turn. - I didn't see a clown. - Dude, how could you miss him? He was staring at everybody on the rides with his ax all up in the air and stuff. - I saw him. - He's creepy right? - Well, you see, monsters aren't real. They're just here for the festival. - You're so funny, aren't you? - Who cares about the fucking clown anyway? - Well, I think all clowns are scary. - Oh yeah. Alana, Antonio's waving at you, again. Why don't we go over there and say hi? Come on. - No way. - What was that about? - She's trying to set me up with Antonio. - That jerk? - Hey, he's a hottie. Ooh, food. Thank you, Hunter. - You're welcome. - Have you talked to Teddy lately? - No, but he was on the Tilt-A-Whirl. - He's with Taylor. - It's okay, you're way better than that little whore. - At least you have Antonio. - True. - Better not see us tonight, that's all I'm saying. - We got your back. - I got your back. - It's gonna go down. - I got her back, too. - You know what, we should just forget about this and go check out the Haunted Maze. - Of course, yeah! ♪ We fell in love in sunny Cancun ♪ Drinking tequila, shot after shot ♪ Watch the moon flip over the sun ♪ That's the night I half forgot ♪ And we said the word forever ♪ That's what made it clear ♪ So I'm putting down, shooting down ♪ And gather around ♪ Sittin' right here ♪ 'Cause tequila makes me happy ♪ Tequila makes me sad ♪ Tequila makes me fall down sometimes ♪ It makes me downright mad, yeah ♪ Tequila makes ♪ I'll try ♪ You think by now ♪ I forget about her ♪ From the bottom of this empty glass ♪ And as the salt melts against my tongue ♪ Her memory kicks my ass ♪ And I think, I think she had one more drink ♪ I could've made her stay ♪ But I hold up my glass and say ♪ Here's to the past ♪ To the one that got away ♪ Tequila makes me happy ♪ Tequila makes me sad ♪ Tequila makes me fall down sometimes ♪ Makes me downright mad ♪ Tequila made her love me ♪ Tequila made her leave ♪ Oh now that she's gone there's more tequila for me ♪ Oh now that she's gone there's a lot more tequila for me Ah, just keep setting up those margaritas, man. - $10, 10 bucks. - I'm saying we're gonna get a hoodie. I'm freezing. - Oh, that's cute. - Dude, don't cover the goods. - You're sick. - Hey, he's your boyfriend. Nice choice. - I think it was a good choice. - According to the surveillance cameras, the seven missing teens arrived at the Haunted Maze at 8:26 p.m., October 31st. Do you recall this particular group of teenagers? - I do not recall. - You do not recall? Well, let's take a stroll down memory lane. Here they are again at 9:09 p.m, and at 10:26 p.m., they're seen entering the Haunted Maze barn alive. The details starting to clear up for you now? - I've seen many children. They do not look familiar. - Clancy Keller, are you telling me you do not recognize this particular group of teenagers seen on this footage? - Perhaps I did. Perhaps I did not. Should I say it again, in case you forgot? You're both so sure that I have offended when that tape only proves the teenagers attended. - Really? Well, you better dig into your mind pretty damn quick. Your sisters have baited you out as the killer. - You need to cooperate with us. - You're not leaving here until you recall what happened. - Oh I'm diggin'. - Is it true you were the only survivor of schoolhouse killings? - Well, now that's very impressive, Detective. I see you've done your homework. - True? - I am sitting here. - And your father was in fact the killer? - Do you recall what happened? - Since you've done your homework, Detective, you already know what I shared with the police. I suggest you review your information again if you're confused. - I find it fascinating to find out that you spent a few years here in Panama, and this is your first time to return since the schoolhouse killings. - Halloween spirit, so fair in the air, and little brat children in the costumes they wear, so rude and quite spoiled and my last nerve, they boiled. So today is the day their flesh I will tear. - Hey, I dare you to bob for apples. - That's easy. - Is this what your father said-- - It's what I imagined was in his mind. - Clancy Keller, this shit is getting deep. Let me assist you with your digging process, okay. Now this portion of this tape that we're about to view is the seven missing teens entering the haunted barn, correct? - Perhaps it is. Perhaps it is not. - Well, let's take a look. - Come on! - He's gonna kill us. - That was really scary. - It's okay. - Is it cool? - Oh whoa! - Whoa! - What'd I say? What'd I say? - Welcome to the Haunted Maze. Please step to the center of the room. - Tearing the flesh away from her bones excited me unlike ever before. Blood coursed through my veins with a killing desire. My once loved Greta lay in pieces, strewn across the floor, dead as dreams. A new nightmare began. Even now, I rot and lie stinking in the earth, my soul confined to the walls within this house. And you have come to taunt and torment me with your lives. And I still desire young, warm flesh. Go, behind you, enter. - Okay. - Um, that is not my forte. - Oh my God! - Oh my God, where's Jordan? - This is insane. Get moving, chicken. Get off of me! Oh my God! - God, it's a vampire! Told you this was fucked up, honey. - Oh my God! - Keep going. - I don't want to be here anymore. Oh my God! - Go, go! Go, go! - Uh-uh, uh-uh, not happening! - How do we get out of here? Oh. - Over here. - Oh my God, do you see it? - Go! - Oh no! - Dead, he's dead. - There's a wall. Okay, stop. - Oh my God, you're so slow! - Oh God. - Ew, what is that? - Ew, ew, ew! - It just grabbed my leg. - I am Clancy the Killer Clown, and I sever heads from town to town. Oh look, what a sin, there's one in my bin, laying ever so quietly next to its kin. Get out! - Oh God! - Oh God, oh God! - It's okay. - Oh my God! - Babe, are you okay? - Oh God, oh God. - So guys, this is it, right? - Oh God. - Whoa, it's dark, man. - Where's the door? - Hey, this really uncool. - What the hell? Oh my God. I just noticed the door won't open. - Jordan! - Where you at, girl? Where you at? There has to be a door in here somewhere. Over here! It's right there. There's a handle on this one. - Okay, let's wait. - Guys. - It's locked! - Honestly! - The door was open. - Not funny! - We're deep in this! - We're gonna die. - You guys, let us out! - We're gonna die. - Do you hear somethin'? - So you don't recognize this group of teenagers, but you're on camera following them around like your next meal, not to mention grabbing the arm of the missing female. What do you have to say for yourself? - A haunted facility is an establishment designed to frighten the public. Perhaps I did see them. Perhaps I do not recall. - That's not what you said last time. - Well, we have proof, right here. There are laws and regulations governing haunted facilities. - You are aware of the laws and rules to run a haunted facility? There is no touching at all. You're aware of that, correct? - Get off of me! - I know what I know. And I share what I share. - Just answer the fuckin' question. - I see someone has anger issues. I live by the family rule. Each year when the hallowed spirit is new, each year to thine own self be true. - Family rule? - Can you explain? - We were a traveling circus and really quite styled, till my mother died giving birth to a child. The show became raw and was shut down by the law for questionable reasons still yet unfiled. So we moved to a town, and we tried to fit in, until my father committed that sin. So the sibling gathered in a room for din and decided our family would travel again. - Getting more interesting. - So after the schoolhouse killings, your family went back out on the road? - Don't believe everything you hear, Detective, and only half of what you see. - Moving on. The seven teens are shown climbing a ladder. Where does that ladder lead, any idea? - I do not recall. - You have no idea where this ladder might lead visitors to the Haunted Maze? - Nope. - We went back to the barn. The ladder's nowhere to be found. So it just vanished? - Perhaps it did. Perhaps it did not. - Can you share with us where the teens may have been located in the barn, overnight? - The barn? - Your traveling entourage, park an RV on the property where you're gonna set the festival, correct? - I believe that is the case in most of our setups. - Who resided in the RV? - The traveling entourage. - Who was there the evening of October 31st? - I do not recall. - Let me share this with you. Next time the teens are seen, they're running into the barn at 5:14 a.m. A.M., so they were there overnight and are still alive. The teens' minivan never left the Halloween festival property. As you see, we have you on camera chasing the seven teens. - Is this funny to you, Clancy? - Pesky teenagers. What you think is fact is, in fact, false. - Let us out! - My God, is this a snake? Okay. - That was metal. I don't know. Wait, something, anyone? Like a little juice, jack-in-the-box. I'm not scared. Go in the wrong door? - Try to-- - I don't know. - Let's just wait. - Let's play What If. - I'm game. - Well, Maci picks first. - Why does she always get to go first? - Dude, you know the rules. She said she's game first. - Okay, eight. - Seven. - One. - Two. - Nine. - 10. Well, Maci wins it with eight. - Oh dude, she wins! - Okay, I've got one. What if we're all stranded in this haunted house with psychos, and you have this one chance to say goodbye to all your friends, what would you say? - I love you all. Don't forget me. - I would just tell everyone come fuckin' find me! - You guys, I'm serious. I have this really horrible feeling in the pit of my stomach that something bad is gonna happen. I know we're just here until tomorrow, but this feeling is gut-wrenching. I mean, this is freaky. None of our phones are working. It's like the power has been jammed or something. I mean, is anybody's phone working at all, anyone's? - No, I have nothing. - Mine shut off. - Can anyone hear us, anyone out there? - Come on, this isn't fucking right. - We're in here! - It's wrong! - Let us go here, come on! - You got my money. - Come on, it's not cool. - Hello? Hello! - Let us go! - Well, hello. - Hello. I'm Agent Hawk. - What brings you out here? - Oh I've been following Clancy the Clown and his entourage since Chicago, Illinois on a narcotics tip. - Yeah, well, those carnies are pretty weird people. - Indeed. So I was just curious. What's your status here? - Well, let me tell you what's going on. - So Clancy has more kids locked in the barn. - Again? - Again. - Yeah? - Hi, I'm Officer O'Doyle, and this here is-- - Agent Hawk. - What do you want? - We just need to ask you a couple of questions. - What? - Who is that? - It's the po-pos. They have some questions for you. - Is this your property? - Nah, we just hold up shop here. - For the traveling carnival. - I noticed a minivan in the parking lot. It belongs to a couple of teenagers who have been missing all night long, and their parents wanted us to come out and check around for them. - Well, what's that got to do with us? - Yeah, who are you here to see? - Agent Hawk, want to come in? - Have any of you ladies seen a group of teenagers, around closing? - Not at closing. Well, if you don't mind, we'd like to take look around the grounds. - It'll cost you. - Ca-ching! - I handle the money in this entourage. - No, you don't. - Yeah, I does. - No, you don't. - Yeah, I does! - No, you don't! - Yeah! - We're just gonna take a look around then, okay? - Blah, blah, blah. - You should go now. - I had Officer Trent check the carnival rides already, so I'll go ahead, and I'll check the back barn. - I'll check the front one. - Alrighty, let's go. - Hello? Hello? Is anybody there? Look what I found? - Cute. - Yeah. Did you find anything? - Nah. - I haven't seen anything either. - Let's go check behind the barn, you know, the parking lot, all good. - Got it, got it. - Hey, someone out there! Guys, let us out! We're stuck in here! - We've got hard. - Let us out! - I'm just holding, come on! - You locked us in! - Officer Trent here. The Landers' minivan was there, but we took around the festival property and the barns. We didn't see 'em. - We also spoke with a couple of the carnival workers, and they hadn't seen anyone at closing time, either. - Orders from the chief are for you to stay put. The Landers are on their way. - We just left there. We searched the entire property. No one's there. I'm bettin' the kids took off with another friend, and they're havin' themselves a good time. You know what I mean? - Oh, but I need you to get back out there. Report in when back-up arrives. - Back-up? - We hear you, partner. - Not another word, we're on our way. - Hey! - We're ready to go now. - Open the door! - Please, somebody. - Well, I got orders from Chief Harrison. They're for us to stay here at the festival grounds and for you-- - I'm supposed to be home right now. The sun is comin' up. - And for you, Officer Trent, you're to take my car, go into town and check out a call that came in earlier about a girl who was wandering in a field near Main Street. The chief said that the Landers family will be here soon, so hurry back. - You got it. - Looks like you're pullin' double duty there, O'Doyle. - Thanks. - Turn on the car and warm it up a bit. - Sure thing. - It's cold. - It's freezing in here. Oh shit! What the hell? - That was priceless. - Nice. - Oh. - Damn clown. - What was that? - Yeah, what was that? - Shit, my heels! - Your fingerprints were found on this young female's body. Unless you can explain or unless you know who's behind these killings, if it was one of your younger sisters or another worker, we can work out a deal for you. - Or prison is calling your name for life. - That tape only proves the teens were at the haunted facility, camping out for some alone time. And the fingerprints you have, ever so divine, you are well aware are not of mine. Thanks for playing. - Detective Cole? Can I have a word with you? - Yes, sir. - You ever been to prison? If you take a shower, don't drop the soap. They will butt-fuck you. You sure you want to go there, hmm? Oh boy, they'll have a lot of fun with you. They like make-up. - Sounds intriguing. - Oh it is, yeah. Okay, without a doubt, without a doubt. Oh they'd love you, that long, pretty hair. Yeah, I'd like to be there. Unfortunately, I got a date. - What the hell's going in there? - Well, before his lawyer arrives, we need to get to the bottom of where the teens might be or a confession. - Oh, I get that, but you do realize that you just threw down on the table information he already has. We just confirmed that we don't know anything about those teenagers. - Sir, I know I took a stab in the dark. However, I might be spot on with this information. - Might be spot on doesn't cut it. The sociopathic mind, the way it works, the girl in the picture you showed him is alive. Clancy knows this. - We gave him too much information. I know I, I saw his facial expression the second we threw the picture down on the table saying his fingerprints were on it. Dammit. - You notice how he became pleasantly agitated? - I was evaluating his body movements, and I did notice he became agitated by this comment. He was almost pleasantly agitated. - He knows what happened to whom and where those teenagers are. Now we need to get that information and whoever the hell hired this clown and his traveling carnival. - I already have someone on it, sir. - No, wait, wait. I need you to choose your words wisely. We don't have much time to get this information out of him. This family comes from old money. I'm sure their lawyers are on the way here now. I remember this clown's father. The Kellers came to town, acting like they owned it. It wasn't but three months or more later that Mr. Keller slaughtered all those school kids, including my older brother. - I'm so sorry, Chief. - I know it's in his blood to do the same thing. I don't want this man on the street. - I'm on it, Chief. - Time, time. - Yes, sir. Yes, sir. - Take care. Get in there, go. - Yes, sir. So, tell us, Clancy Keller, are there any survivors? - Are there any deaths? - According to the list of missing people, eight, most likely dead. - Don't say another word. I'm Clancy Keller's attorney. There's a colossal difference between missing and dead, detectives. Mr. Keller, let's go. - What's the next town? - Two detectives looking quite pale, interrogating to no avail. But that last question you peddled, when the ash is settled, the truth shall prevail. Two detectives assailed the clown, frantically writing everything down, wasting valuable time, committing the crime, good people falling all of the time. - Clancy, you better go home. - Guys, this way. Finally. There, go! - Oh my God! - Go! - Go, go, go! - Go! No, no! No! No! I just want you all to know, I'd like to remember this face before I leave this place, for all the good, the bad, the happy and the sad, it was fun partying with you while it lasted, which was way too little time. I love you. No, no! No, no! No, no, no! - No, please, no, please! Stop! Mom, Dad, Holly, no matter how many fights we get in, no matter how many times we're mad at each other, I'll always love you. I love you unquestionably. - Oh shit! Get away from me! Please. - Little boy blue. Boo hoo. - I just want you all to know that I love you. And I'll never forget you. Please, don't be sad. It's my time to go, I guess. I know I've done some good and also some bad, but I'll treasure all our memories. And please remember me. I'll see you soon on the other side. I truly love you all. - Welcome to Haunted Maze. ♪ What's the story I'm trying to tell ♪ Round and round like a carousel ♪ Face to fear without regret ♪ Beyond the shadow of my silhouette ♪ Easy at first, I declared ♪ Pistol rose to the auctioneer ♪ Matter said, purpose foul ♪ Rapid voice, disemboweled ♪ Demons come, demons go ♪ Step aside, let them flow ♪ Demons come, demons go ♪ Step aside, let them flow ♪ This is where I explain my fate ♪ Pointing fingers, malice, hate ♪ Troubled past, pain was true ♪ Template dire, options few ♪ Amended fate, years to learn ♪ Abacus, taciturn ♪ Perhaps I seek what I get ♪ Lost words when tongues duet ♪ Demons come, demons go ♪ Step aside, let them flow ♪ Demons come, demons go ♪ Step aside, let them flow ♪ A loud voice held such sway ♪ Cowered, cornered, helpless prey ♪ Whispered phrases, wandered south ♪ Vanished, vanquished tantamount ♪ Pride to swallow, will befall ♪ The tourniquet troubles all ♪ Seems like words count ♪ Matters less as Sermons Mount ♪ Demons come, demons go ♪ Step aside, let them flow ♪ Demons come, demons go ♪ Step aside, let them flow ♪ It is fine, we now insist ♪ No reason for the anarchist ♪ I have a plan to bury things ♪ A feudalist with empty rings ♪ Call beyond conscious thought ♪ A hurricane vainly fought ♪ All this, say again ♪ Racketeers, denizen ♪ Demons come, demons go ♪ Step aside, let them flow ♪ Demons come, demons go ♪ Step aside, let them flow ♪ Demons come, demons go ♪ Step aside, let them flow ♪ Demons come, demons go ♪ Step aside, let them flow ♪ Demons come, demons go ♪ Dance, dance, dance, dance ♪ Dance, dance, dance ♪ Dance, dance, dance, dance ♪ Dance, dance, dance ♪ Dance, dance, dance, dance ♪ Dance, dance, dance ♪ Dance, dance, dance, dance ♪ Dance, dance, dance
