There's not enough rope in all Florence to dispose of these villains. We'll declare a holiday and hang them in the piazza. Bronzio... Bronzio... Is that the Borgian whelp? Hmm... we cannot hang a Borgia. - There are other means. - Yes, so there are, Polverino. We'll put hot eggs under his armpits We'll soak his feet in salt water and allow the goats to lick them, after which his ears will be severed. If he survives our hospitality, there are other pleasures with which we can regale him. You have our permission to withdraw. There, Ottaviano, are some necks for you to play with. - The Council is dismissed. - There are other matters, Your Excellency. - What other matters? - The case of Benvenuto Cellini. What, Cellini again? What's he done now? Another murder, Your Excellency. - Who is it this time? - A nobleman. - In Venice. - Venice? Why does he have to kill Venetians, haven't we got enough people right here? This time he must be punished. There's only one punishment for him, Your Excellency, Don't taunt me, I know what I'm doing. Just because you happen to have a personal grievance against the man. Oh, this isn't a personal matter, Your Excellency. Oh, I know, because he's been clever enough to outwit you at times, you, you, you... Yes... why doesn't he tend to his own business? After all, there's no artist like him. Why does he have to go around murdering people? There's only one punishment for him, Your Excellency. There you go again! Am I the Duke of Florence or am I not the Duke of Florence? Are you the Duke of Florence, or is Cellini the Duke of Florence? Who is the Duke of Florence, I'd like to know. Her Excellency, the Duchess of Florence. Her Excellency, the Duchess of Florence. Her Excellency, the Duchess of Florence. We've been discussing grave matters of state, milady. Mine too is a grave matter of state, milord. Where are the golden service plates? The golden service plates... I don't know, I... - Perhaps, Your Excellency, I can suggest... - You can suggest nothing. What, what plates, my dear? The Duchess of Milan arrives on Monday. For that occasion I've ordered golden service plates. Well, if milady entrusted Cellini with the commission, heaven knows if they'll ever be finished. - Cellini? - What, Cellini again? Am I never to be rid of this scoundrel? I... this is no time to discuss such matters, my dear. This is just the time to discuss it, milord. Are we to be forced to eat from troughs like pigs... ...because some goldsmith neglects his duties? - You should have forced him to... - I should have? - Certainly you should have forced him. - What am I, just an old... Oh... this is very upsetting. Gentlemen, the Council is dismissed. We'll..., I... well, it's dismissed. You should have forced him to work, even at the point of a sword. Must everything be left to me? Am I responsible because Cellini neglects his duties? Because he runs around murdering people? There were certain activities of Cellini in Venice... ...more grievous than murder. More grievous than murder? What could be more grievous than murder? At this very moment, an emissary from the doge Francesco Frascare awaits you. An emissary... await... I mean... You mean waiting? - What for? - To demand of Your Excellency an apology. An apology? Why, I... Oh, yes, of course, for the murder of that Venetian. No, no, another reason. Shall I have him brought in? Well, yes... I suppose so. Cavalier Baldini, emissary of His Highness Doge Francesco Frascari of Venice. We bid you welcome, Cavalier Baldini. - The, um... - This lady, Your Excellency, ...is the youngest daughter of the royal house of Bocci. I would that I might spare the mention of her name. Ah... the royal house of... yes... Um... I think, milady, you'd better go. I choose to remain. Uh? Oh, yes... Milady chooses to remain. But you can go! There's no sense in your stay... Well, what is it? Must I speak, Your Excellency? Why, yes... naturally. Otherwise, how should we ever... I mean, if someone's been insulted... We, um... yes, what is it? Come, come, my child, you must not be frightened. I was seated in the garden of my father's palace. The moon was high. The perfume of flowers filled the air. I sat there dreaming of my prince. Oh... someone you know? Just my prince. All girls dream of a prince, you know. Oh, is that so? I never knew that. - It's quite customary with young girls. - Oh, yes, so it is. - Proceed. - All of a sudden he appeared. Like a wraith in the moonlight. - He, who? - This monster Cellini. Don't interrupt! - He appeared from where? - Over the garden wall. I think he was being pursued. - You should have screamed for help. - I tried to scream. But my voice failed me. I tried to flee. I was paralyzed to move. His eyes, they held me. I was as one hypnotized. - He... he hypnotized you? - What did he then do? - He read to me. - Read to you? He hypnotyzed you and then he read to you? - Well, this all sounds very silly to me. - Alesandro. Your Excellency must hear further. Very well, he read to you. From a book, I suppose. A small book, a gold it was, encrusted with jewels. Yes, never mind about the book. What did he read? A poem, with words such as only Venus and Adonis might have spoken on their bridal night. Drop those luscious lips to mine, those bright, those coral lips of thine. Give me soft, a velvet kiss. The cadence of his voice wove about me a magic spell. I must have swooned. I don't know. I don't care! You forced me to come here! I've told my story, so boo! It's my affair. He can come over my garden wall all he wants to. Your Excellency, this is... this is very unexpected. I... I must apologize for this intrusion. Oh, no, it's quite all right, it's no bother. Am I to understand that this ugly, squat little goldsmith... ...holds such fascination for women? Oh, he's not ugly. I'm afraid milady mistakes Cellini for his apprentice. His apprentice? I have been dealing with his apprentice? How dare he! It's Cellini's boast that he ignores all ethics and law. Yes, he runs around hypnotizing people. That's a terrible thing to do. How can any woman be safe with such a creature around? He's carrying things a little too far. I mean, he must be punished. I'm afraid perhaps we'll have to hang him. - Then milord agrees to his execution? - Yes, I'm afraid so. We must. It's too bad, he does make such pretty things. Wait a minute, milord. Perhaps it would be better to temper justice with wisdom. - But, milady... - I am thinking of the golden plates. Are we to be outshone by the Duchess of Milan? After all, he's murdered no one of great importance. Oh, I know, but that's not the point. I mean... he might suddenly make up his mind and... how can you tell? - I agree with milord. - You're always agreeing! Why don't you... We must handle this matter with great shrewdness, Alessandro. First he shall complete the plates, then we shall hang him. The finish of his handiwork will mark the beginning of his doom. Yes, neatly said! The... the finish of his... shall begin the doom. That's very good, Ottaviano. - Yes, milord. - Yes... Remember, Alesandro, you have made your decision. Yes. But is Your Excellency going to allow this... I have made my decision! Yes... doom, doom... The finish is the beginning of his doom. He finishes the plates and we finish him. - Your Excellency! - What? Your Excellency, I bring a message from your nephew, the count Matheo. - Yes, where is he? - In bed. With two leeches on his nose to reduce the swelling. Leeches? Well, go on, speak up. Well, we were passing the Duomo when suddenly we were set upon. We attempted to draw... but our assailant knocked the sword out of Count Matheo's hand... ...and sent me sprawling into the gutter. Then the wretch leaped upon Count Matheo's back... ...forcing his face into the filth of the street. Why should he do that? Because he claimed that Count Matheo had once called him... ...a detestable little fly that should be exterminated. And he said that while the Count Matheo was not big enough to exterminate him, ...he would give him the opportunity of exterminating any other fly in Florence. - And that's what happened. - What do you mean what happened? He actually forced the Count Matheo to swallow two live flies. - Oh, two! - But you have not yet named this assailant. Benvenuto Cellini, Your Excellency. Oh, the assassin! How dare he lay hands on a de Medici, my own nephew? This is the end! I mean, plates or no plates, Duchess or no Duchess. I mean, we've go to... Ottaviano, get the guard. - Polverino, do something! - Guards! Where's my armor, I want my sword... Oh, yes, here it is, never mind. Come in. I'm up here, you lughead! Open up! - Lock the door. - What's wrong? Hurry up or I'll shave your ears off. Has something happened, master? Has something happened, isn't something always happening? - Today it was Matheo. - Count Matheo? That pig Matheo. I changed his diapers. You didn't dare touch a de Medici. There are many de Medicis, there is only one Cellini. Men like myself never happen twice. Anyway, I closed his scourless smouth with appropriate spider food. You must flee, master. From spiders? They attacked me in the streets, two of them. One I killed, this Matheo lied dying, and then I hung a ruby necklace on him that will not wear off for many a day. - You killed him? - I don't know, I was forced to flee. I left my dagger sticking in his throat. But you're wearing your dagger. Are you trying to make me out a liar? - Have you finished the plates? - Yes, master. You botcher, you fool! Do you never learn? These aren't even good enough for the stupid old Duke. Get out before I fix you a crown that won't come off. Angela. Angela. Hello. - I guess I was sleeping. - Of course you were. - I've been waiting all morning. - Have you, my Angela? - Are we modeling today? - Time enough for that tomorrow. Well... then I might as well go home. Must I see you only when I have a chisel in my hand? You never think that I'm a man as well as an artist? - Mother says not to. - Oh, blast the old hag. - Yes, sir. - Say, "Yes, Benvenuto". Yes, Benvenuto. I've been making bobbin lace all morning. - You haven't looked at my bobbin lace. - I am looking, my Angela. - You're not looking at my bobbin work. - Try to understand, my Angela. There is time for bobbin work and there is time for love. But they never mix, my Angela. Look at me. Look at me! But I am looking. Are you stone, marble, alabaster? What is alabaster? Do you know that I am mad about your hair, your eyes? Do you know that I am jealous that nature and not I created you? Oh, Angela, why did you have to come into my life at it's very end? Is your life going to end? Yes, tomorrow I shall be wearing a hemp and necklace. Tomorrow, Cellini the artist will be kicking at the gates of Hades. Today, Cellini the man would have a glimpse of heaven. - You mustn't come near me. - Awaken, my Angela. You go through life as if you were in a dream in a dream. You are like flowing gold ready to be shaped into a woman. - You frighten me. - I love you like an angel. - And I love you like a man. - My mother has forbidden me... Oh, drat your mother! You must think as I think and do as I do. Aha! Aha! So, she must think as you think and do as you do, huh? Yes, and you're not going to stop it. Get your things, we're going home. - She's not leaving! - She is! - She's not! - She is! You're not leaving, my Angela. The old hag agreed that you were to stay until my work was finished. Hag? Hag? You dare call me that to my face? Your face? That thing you wear can't possibly be your face. May you be blasted in spinach! I've noticed of late that you've been growing a beard. You really shouldn't do it, it doesn't become you. May you be strung by your thumb. Let's cease these compliments and talk business. - Hm, you dare ask that my daughter... - You have no daughter! You have a property that I am willing to buy for my model. Didst Thou make this man who has so little respect for the feelings of a mother... that to put things so plainly... - Fifty ducates. - Fifty ducates? - Too much. - Fifty ducates. - Too much! - Forty-five. - No! - Forty. - No. - Forty or nothing. - Thirty ducates. - Make it thirty-five. - Done. Open in the name of His Excellency the Duke of Florence! Get in there. I'll get rid of him in no time. - I want my ducates. - You'll get your ducates! Don't worry, my little crawfish, I'll see that you get them. Open in the name of His Excellency the Duke of Florence! Open in the name of His Excellency! Your Excellency! My poor house is more than honored by your presence. Your poor house would be more than honored by the presence of any peaceful man. - Splendid, Your Excellency. - What... yes! Milord mustn't forget the purpose of his visit. Oh, yes... Time after time we have pardoned your grave crimes on condition that you keep the peace. - With all gratitude I remember. - You remember nothing. You're a, a... This morning, in broad daylight, you dared attack and humiliate a de Medici! The nephew of your ruler. Count Matheo? What's happened to Count Matheo? There you are, you see? He's not only a lot of other things, he also tells lies as well. - Oh, yes, I remember now. - Yes, you remember, do you? Matheo gave me the insult. My fault is that I... I tried to pattern myself too much after Your Excellency. That is, to be peaceful when I am insulted. The insolence! No, no, come now, Ottaviano, you must admit that was rather neatly said. Milord forgets his oath to hang Cellini. Uh? Oh... yes. Uh... we are going to hang you. Take him away, put him in the dungeon, put him in chains. Wait a minute, wait a minute. Where are my golden service plates? I shall never be able to finish them now. What, you haven't finished them? How are we going to bank with the Duchess of Milan without plates? Why don't you tend to business instead of running around killing people? Jumping over walls frightening young girls. Where's my chalice? Haven't you finished that either? It's, um, not yet worthy of Your Excellency. Well, why haven't you finished it? Where do you suppose I'm going to keep my dear cousin's ashes? I can't... there's no... we've got... Oh... and who are you, my child? - I'm Angela. - Angela? Um... yes, of course. If you're going to hang him now, Mother and I would like to leave. Um... who is she? It's a lily, milord, who has admired you from afar for many a day. In fact, she was the cause of my quarrel with Matheo. Knowing you to be a connoisseur of beauty and art, I was, um... in the very act of taking her to the palace... ...when I was set upon by Matheo. In fact, he would have robbed you of her. Yes, um... does she know who I am? No, no, I told her you were but one of the Court. Oh, then it's not because I'm the Duke. Your Excellency underestimates his own charms. Hm... You remain. The rest of you may retire. I'll settle this in my own... Is Milord going to allow this Cellini to pull the wool over his eyes? Who pull wool over whose eyes? I'm handling this myself, now run along, get out. Now... do you like me, Angela? - I don't know. - You don't know? - She's timid. - Oh.. of course. You don't know who I am, do you? Yes, Your Excellency. There you are, you see, she knew all the time. If she did, it was only because she knew that the most royal, the most handsome, the most charming man in all Florence must be the Duke. Yes... you've never been to the palace, have you, Angela? - No, milord. - Would you like to come some time? No, sir... I mean, I don't think so, Your Excellency. Of course she would, of course she would. She doesn't know what she's saying, Your Excellency. - What's that? - I am her mother, Your Excellency. There must be some mistake. She looks like a goat. There's a marked resemblance. - Come here. - Me? No, no, no, the other one. Uh... that's far enough. Polverino. She... she's rather pretty, isn't she? Yes, Milord. She'd make a rather excellent addition to the court, don't you think? Yes, Milord. The other ladies in the court are so very ugly. Yes, Milord. Do you... the Duchess won't be at the summer palace tonight, eh? The whole court has moved officially to the winter palace, Milord. Oh, yes, yes, of course. You're sure? - Yes, milord. - Well, that's fine. Yes... well, you arrange everything. Yes, Milord. Oh, one moment. We needn't mention this little matter to the Duchess. No, Milord. Come with me. You're not going, my Angela. - Who says she's not going? - I don't want to go. Yes, you do, my little fawn. Yes, of course you do, come along. - But she's my model, Your Excellency. - Well, go get another model. Come along, come along. Yes, there you are. Besides, I'm going to hang you. At least I haven't changed my mind. And you've got work to do, you've got to finish those plates. We've got people coming to dinner. I hope the food is worthy of the plate. What's that? I hope the plates are worthy of the food, Your Excellency. Yes.. I don't believe that's what you said at all. You, you... well, however. Angela, my Angela! Damned, may all the dukes in Christendom rot in Hades. Be careful, master, he might come back. I hope he does come back! You'd better lock that door. Welcome again, Ottaviano, have you forgotten something? I'm not as careless in such matters as you are. Do you recognize this kerchief? Very pretty, isn't it? It's your best kerchief, master, where did you find it? Ask your master where he left it. And very pretty she is too, Ottaviano, though a bit on the plumpy side. You think yourself safe because the Duke has pardoned you. Well... I haven't! I wouldn't be too careless with that blade, my friend. Whoever destroys Cellini before the plates are finished in turn destroys himself. You wouldn't look too handsome swinging at the end of a rope. I've provided against that emergency also. Gentlemen, it would grieve me very deeply... ...if anything were to happen to my friend Cellini. It would further grieve me if any of these beautiful works of art were to be destroyed. Especially the model for a chalice... ...of which my friend is very fond. Gentlemen, I leave him to your tender mercies. Good day. I warn you, my friends, the arm is strong and the steel is sharp. Get him! So you want to fight, do you? I'll teach you to fight! There's something for you! And there! There, you fiends, you want to fight, do you? I'll give you a fight! There's something for you! Ah, you pigs! Ah, you rogues! Fight, you dogs, fight! There's something for you! Now, fire! Now see what you've done! I'll warm your hide for that! - You worm! Swine! - You'll break my chalice, will you? I'll give you heat! Help! Help! Please don't hurt me any more. I didn't mean it! - I wouldn't... - Stop it, I say! Stop in the name of the Duchess of Florence! Stop! Milady! Didn't you hear me announce myself? I was occupied, milady. Occupied? Are you a goldsmith or a... or a common brawler? Clear this place! I regret, milady, that my house is not in order. So you are Cellini? - And this is your workshop? - At times, milady. Unless you are busy murdering people other places. A man must protect his honor. And women, I suppose, must protect themselves. Milady speaks in riddles. And all this, I suppose, is part of your workshop? The nature of my work, milady, requires the necessity of a great deal of room. Hm, so I understand, and a great deal of territory. Why, milady... You see, Cellini, I'm quite well acquainted with your reputation. I warn you, however, don't use any of your hypnotic glances on me. Such a thought would never enter my mind, milady. Indeed, am I to understand then that the Duchess of Florence... ...is not so attractive as these doelike simpletons of Venice? Milady misconstrues my words. It is because you are my duchess that I dare not even raise my eyes to you. Much less my thoughts. Bring me my purse, please. Did you not hear me? I am not a retriever, milady. I command you. Your command is law. And what would you have done if I had not been your duchess? - I hesitate to answer, milady. - I command you to answer. Again you command... I would have wrung your neck, milady. Sit here. You have strong arms with which to wring fair ladies' necks, Cellini. I could have those arms torn from their sockets. I would not thwart milady's pleasure. I could send your handsome head rolling into a basket. However, that is not the purpose of my visit. I came here to entrust you with a commission. I shall promise my best, milady. Which should be very excellent and unusual if all I hear is true. I wish you to make me a duplicate of this key in gold... ...with the de Medici crest placed here. It is a key to the balcony door leading to my apartments, and it is to be in the nature of a... surprise for the Duke. I expect you to deliver it... in person. Were the Duke to see me, I would be forced to explain. - It would no longer be a surprise. - The Duke will not see you. He is to be at the palace in Florence. This is a key to the summer palace. I shall expect you to deliver it... about nine. About nine. - Get the fires going. - Going to work on the plates, master? You lackwit. You can't unlock a door with a plate. # Chi vuol la zingarella # # Graziosa accorta e bella? # # Signori, eccola qua # # Signori, eccola qua # # Le donne sul balcone # # So bene indovinar # # I giovani al cantone # Will I always hear music when I'm a court lady? Oh, yes indeed. What do court ladies have to do? Oh, they just stand around and bow. But we'll talk about that later. What are you doing that for? Why, doesn't that make you whirl and tingle? No, it gives me goosebumps. Well, I don't understand... Are you always like this? Like what, milord? Well, um... Oh, well, never mind. You'll change later. Would you like some more peacock turns? Yes, milord. Oh, and that reminds me, Angela, when we're alone, don't call me milord. I prefer that you call me Bumpy. That's my nickname. But only in private, mind you, never in public. It would dethrone me. Now, let me hear you say it, Bumpy, like that. In front of them? Oh, that's all right, I had them deafened some time ago. Now, say it: Bumpy. - Bumpy. - Splendid! You got it the first time, didn't you? Polverino, why are you not in Florence with the Duke? The Duke, milady? Oh, yes, you see, um... The Duke, um.. Enough! Ottaviano, perhaps you can speak intelligently. Did you not know that we had moved to the winter palace today? The Duke decided against leaving at the last minute, milady. - Why? - An attack of gout, milady. Hm, there is no other reason? Well, he only confided the gout to me, milady. You mustn't be afraid of me, Angela. I'm not afraid of you. Well, I want you to be a little afraid of me. Why? Well, I don't know, it makes me feel more... I feel more... savage. I mean... - She has arrived, Your Excellency. - She has arrived, who has arrived where? - The Duchess. - The Duchess? Oh... oh... No... yes... at the palace? Polverino, that woman has a sixth sense. Why can't I deceive my wife like other men do? Do you suppose she'd mind my being here? Oh, yes, I'm afraid she would. Come, Polverino, get her out quickly. I mean... out on the balcony. Ah, did I surprise you, Alesandro? Surprise? Oh, no... I was afraid every moment that... I mean... I was afraid that you wouldn't get here. I knew you were coming. I can't keep any secrets from you, can I? Oh, I know, I know. Oh, and look, supper for me. Why didn't you let me know? Oh, yes... well... I was expecting you sooner. And there's some music also. Thoughtful Alessandro. I thought music would be nice. You were so hungry that you ate both our suppers, didn't you? Yes... I mean, no, no... um... Polve... Ottaviano joined me at supper. Hm, strange. As I entered the palace, I saw Ottaviano on his way to the dining hall to dine with the others. Oh... you did? Oh... that fellow must have a tapeworm. Alessandro, if I thought... You mustn't think such things, they're very embarrassing. I do trust you, Alessandro. But isn't it time you were in bed? Oh, it's not yet nine. Yes, but I won't have a moment's rest until I know you're safely asleep. Oh, but I would like to stay up a little longer. Now, remember how you suffer with your gout. - Not just a little longer? - No. Now go straight to bed. All right, I will. Good night, my dear. Sleep tight. You may go. So, you have come, Cellini. Ten o'clock, all is well. On the very second, milady. I feared you might find obstacles in your path too great to overcome. Obstacles are nothing, milady. True, I swam through rivers of blood to reach you. Five of Your Excellency's guards have paid with their lives... ...and five more lie wounded. But I would have reached my goal, milady, even though I crawled to your feet but to die. I like that speech, Cellini. I have a surprise for you. The Duke is here. Here... at the palace? - Is Cellini afraid? - Oh, no, no, not for myself. But I... I would not compromise my duchess. So... your courage is composed then only of words. Oh, what you call fear, milady, is that little part of my soul which I call honor. Bah, that word! It's enough to turn an honest woman's stomach. Honor, humph. It is merely a term used by men to cover their quarters. Well, it's just as well I found you out. The tragedy of all great ladies is to discover that the men... ...with the most exaggerated reputations make the poorest lovers. That is the reason we probably marry halfwits. Well, you've delivered the key, so now you may swim back through your rivers of blood to your workshop. You're only a goldsmith after all. You may give me the key and go. Give me the key. Perhaps I should tell the Duke you're here. Perhaps you think I won't tell him. What was that? He's probably falling downstairs again. - Did you break something? - Shh! Wait! If I'm going out there again, I'm going to have something to do. Alessandro, open the door. Is that your wife? Alessandro, open the door! You wait out on the balcony... ...till I find out what this old dido is doing. Alessandro! Alessandro, open the door, I say! Angela! Alessandro! Alessandro! What are you doing over there? What on earth is the matter with you? Oh... uh... where am I? You know where you are. I... must have been walking in my sleep. Well, you should be more careful. Some night you'll fall off that balcony and hurt yourself. Didn't I tell you to go to bed? I'm going to fix you a sleeping potion. Oh, no, I'm all right. - What are you doing here? - What am I doing here? I thought the Duke was mad at you. I have come to your rescue through rivers of blood. Ten of the Dukes guards have paid with their lives. And I would have reached my goal... ...even though I had crawled to your feet but to die. - Really? - Of course, my Angela. Come, we must hurry. - Where are we going? - Tonight we enter paradise. You must sleep tonight, Alessandro, for my sake. - I'm frightened. - Shh! Benvenuto. Angela. Angela. Ang... tchoo! Angetchoo... I'm afraid the night air's too much for me, milady. - Hm, I'm afraid it is. - Yes... Angetchoo! Angetchoo... You'd better take care of yourself too, milady. I will. Good night, milady. Good night, milord. Benvenuto. Here we are, my Angela. At the threshold of paradise. Go, Antonio, fetch the dawn, tell the world that love has come to the mountaintop. And this is paradise itself. I didn't know I was coming to a dirty old place like this. It's your presence that makes it a palace. It's got holes in the roof. Well, what better ceiling than the blue canopy of heaven? Oh... those sheep smell terrible. But those are not sheep. They are princes, changed in form by witchcraft. But you, my fairy queen, will wave your magic wand and restore them to their kingdom. They're sheep and they smell terrible. Get them out of here. Oh... My feet hurt and... ...I wish I'd never left the Duke's palace. - But what is a fat old duke to me? - He's not fat. You've traded a dukedom for a kingdom. And I shall teach you the language of the gods. Here we shall reign and here we shall love. Here we shall reign and here we shall love. I shall create as I have never created before. Hark, the pipes of Pan. It is almost dawn, my Angela. Aurora in all her splendor beckons to us. But we cannot escape even if we would. my beautiful queen. - Benvenuto... - Yes, my love. I'm hungry. How can you think of food at a time like this? - Don't yell at me. - I'm not yelling at you! But I've risked my life to bring you here and you speak of food. Well, haven't you some little cakes or something? I offer you love and you ask for cakes. I don't know why I came here with you anyway. Bah! What did I ever do to you? You take me away from the nice palace... with soft cushions and everything. And you bring me to a place like this with no cushions at all. Bah! I thought I was coming to a nice place. It was nice until I brought you here! The Duke probably will never want to see me again. - And it's all your fault. - Oh, hang the Duke! - He'll hang you! - Huh? You just wait till you get back to Florence. I am going back to Florence! I prefer death to a cold woman. The place is yours! Hear ye, hear ye! A proclamation by His Excellency Alessandro, Lord Duke of Florence! This means the end of that scoundrel. I warned him, but he wouldn't pay any attention to me. Ah, you numbskull! Master! Will you go, where will you hide? There isn't a place in all Florence you'll be safe. There is one place where Cellini will always be safe. And Cellini has the key. Guard. - Where did this come from? - I don't know. Send for the captain. Milady never looked so fresh and lovely. It is not necessary to lie to me. Tell me, is this new captain of the guards as charming and as gallant as you claim him to be? Yesterday he won all honors at the josting matches. You may withdraw, I wish to be alone. And, um... you might send me this captain of the guards. I have a commission for him. Who are you? What are you doing here? Milady! Are you in the habit of entering ladies' boudoirs unannounced? Surely milady jests. The de Medicis are not given to jesting! Has milady so soon forgotten last night? Because venison pleased one's palate last night... ...does not follow that it pleases one today. Today then, milady calls for roasted captain of the guards. Enough of this insolence! You have made for me a key. Give it to me and go. - Milady is sending me to my death. - Small loss. Give me the key. Cellini prefers a thousand deaths... to the displeasure of his duchess. Your words weary me. Milady, I cannot leave until you hear the truth. - I have no interest. - When you summoned me, milady, I sped to you on wings of love. And on wings of love you as quickly sped away. - Milady, I was forced to go. - A likely story. Last night as I waited on your balcony, soldiers appeared. They saw me. To return to your room and compromising you, there was but one course open. I took it. Flinging myself upon the soldiers, I slashed and fought my way to freedom. Two I wounded, the rest pursued me. I ran as a hunted beast, dodging, doubling back on my tracks. Until you found refuge in some fair lady's boudoir, I have no doubt. Can my lady believe that having held you in my arms... ...I could even glance at another woman? If my desperate efforts to save my lady's name bring me to this sorry end, it's best I go. The guards are waiting. As you probably know, there is a price on your head. It would be selfish to deprive an honest guardsman of his just reward. May I make one last request? Make it and go. If milady thirsts for Cellini's blood, let yours be the hand that severs my head from my body. I believe milady requested Cellini's head on a platter. Your belief is well founded, Cellini. This is not a platter, but it will suffice. Yes, that should do very nicely. It is fitting that my head rest in a receptacle of my own creation. Oh, Death, thy presence is divine. Drop those luscious lips to mine. Those ripe, those colored lips of thine. Give me soft a velvet kiss, dovelike, lewd in searching bliss. Captain of the guards, milady. Captain of the guards, milady. - Benvenuto, my love. - Yes, milady? Give me the book. You will have no further need of it. Henceforth, your reading shall be confined to me. Yes, milady. It is just as well you know, my Benvenuto, that it is the Duchess of Florence who dismisses her loves. Her loves never dismiss the Duchess of Florence. Bring me that urn, the silver one. Does my beloved know what is contained therein? It was designed for rose leaves, milady. A long time ago, there was a young and handsome soldier. He was as naughty as he was handsome. I have preserved his heart in there. You would never decieve me, would you, my Benvenuto? Would a man be fool enough to throw away a priceless jewel? Captain! Captain of the Guards! We found him at the north gate. He's been stabbed, sir. - Who did it? - Cellini did it. Surround the palace! Sound the alarm! Cellini's on the palace grounds. I have to leave, they are looking for me, milady. What are we to do? You must hide. They'll never look in the Duke's quarters. You wait here, my beloved. I'll arrange things with Alessandro. Come on. While we are waiting the Duke's pleasure, I should like to show you... ...our gallery of art. Now here is a fragment of sculpture by the master. The subject is a young nobleman of Florence. Loud-mouthed young fellow, very disrespectful to authority. It's rather a well preserved piece, don't you think? Except of course that the tongue is missing. Now here, here is a real work of art. This I think is the master at his best. Ah, I see you're impressed by the master's work. Sir, here is raw material for you. Here, open the door, hurry up! His Excellency the Duke of Florence. The Duke of Florence! Aha! So, they caught you, did they, you blackguard, you. Good work, Ottaviano! This will teach you a lesson you won't forget. Well, hurry up, go on! Put the noose around his neck. - I can explain everything, Your Excellency. - You can explain nothing... you sheep in wolf's... you, you... You've jumped over your last wall. You know what you did. You did it right under my very nose. - Go on, string him up! - If you'll only listen, Your Excellency! I'll listen to nothing. Go on, string him up. There you go again, you're always bungling. Alessandro! Alessandro, wait! - Pull him up, pull him up. - Wait! Wait! Just a minute, milady, I'm busy. Alessandro, I command you, wait! Open this door! Open this door or I'll have you put you on the rack! Her Excellency the Duchess of Florence. Her Excellency the Duchess of Florence. You shouldn't have come down here, it's too damp, you'll catch cold. - And what are you doing here? - I'm just hanging this fellow. Fools, if he hangs, we all shall hang. - The guards are dismissed. - Oh... no, uh... uh... I want the guards to remain. The guards are not to withdraw. This is a very secret matter. Oh, uh, yes... Well, all right. Guards... dismissed. Why are you always interfering? You pardoned this man once, why are you hanging him now? - I can explain, milady. - Be quiet! Who... no one asked you for any explanation. Yes, silent until you're spoken to. Doesn't milady know that Cellini stole into the palace gardens one night passed? - What do you mean by that? - He came intent on stealing, milady. Something the Duke holds most precious. And what does the Duke hold most precious? Oh... nothing... just a little trinket. You talk too much, Ottaviano. You've got the Duchess all upset. Strange that only this morning, milady wanted Cellini's life. Yes, that's right, you did. You offered two thousand ducates for Cellini's head. - Why do you object to a little hanging? - I have not changed my mind, milord. I should like nothing better than to see the scoundrel hang from the highest beam. But it is not his neck I'm thinking of, but ours. - What have our necks got to do with it? - You don't know what I know. I have just learned from my secret agents... ...that the people of Florence are about to revolt. They're incensed over the last wholesale hangings in the piazza. They think you're a butcher, a madman. A bu.. a ma... they do? I've done nothing of the kind. Of course you're not. I know you as a good, kind husband. But we're on the verge of a revolution. And one more hanging might light the torch. Light the... why, this is terrible. Ottaviano, why didn't you tell me? Milady seem to have information that no one else possesses. You mustn't listen to Ottaviano, you must listen to me. One never knows one's friends. Why, right in this room there might be spies. Now, with a peasant or an unknown, it might be worth the risk. But with Cellini, an artist, a goldsmith. Where are you going to find another Cellini, another master? Silence, knave! Alessandro, you may use your own discretion, Of course, if you don't mind being hanged, I don't either. The decision rests with you. But surely milord isn't afraid. That's all very well for you to say, Ottaviano, it's not your neck they want, it's mine. I'd be brave too if it was your neck they wanted. Here, unnoose him. Take the noose off... I don't know why it is every time I want to hang you something always happens. Why not let me take the responsibility for his hanging, Your Excellency? Yes, that might not be a... Oh, you shouldn't have said that. Run along now, go on. And you too, run along, hurry up. I'm sorry I... have to disappoint you, but I'll have someone for you next week. And you too, goodbye! Hurry up, hurry up! There, that's over. But it's not over yet, I'll hang you before I'm finished. Now go on, get out of here, get out of the palace. - Go on back to your Angela. - My Angela? That's what I said, your Angela. What have you done with her? - Well, milord... - Don't try to deny anything. That's why I was hanging you. Where is she? - Angela? - Yes, Angela. She's pining for you, milord, in a mountain cabin. - For me? - For you! Well, why didn't you tell me that before? Milord, it's rather difficult to speak with a rope around one's neck. Yes, but why did you take her away from me? Why did you... you... Milord, if you... No, I'm not going to believe one word you say. I was only acting in your interest. - My interest? - Yes. I heard that the Duchess was coming to the summer palace. At the risk of my life I entered the palace grounds... ...and snatched Angela from under the very eyes of your Duchess. And again at the risk of my life I took her from the palace grounds... ...to a haven of safety. Oh, well that's very different. That isn't what you told me, Ottaviano. Now go on, run along, get out of here. You, you... there's no... whatever you... Yes... why not bring Angela here tonight? - Oh, milord, that's impossible. - Impossible, why? - The Duchess, milord. - What's the Duchess got to do with it? - Well, she has nothing to do with it... - Well, there you are. We're giving a banquet tonight for somebody or other... ...and you can bring Angela here to me, say that she is your model, say anything. Milord, you don't know what you're doing to me. I know what I will do to you! Shall I take you back and hang you? Your... milord, I prefer not. Well, will you do as I say? Yes, Your Excellency. Yes, well... That's more like it. Your Excellencies, the Duke and Duchess of Florence. We bring you greetings from the Duke and Duchess of Milan. We return your greetings, and welcome. Yes, welcome, Cavalier Traviggi. Ottaviano tells me the great artist Cellini will be present this evening. Ottaviano is well informed. We are rather jealous of you. Cellini's fame is rapidly spreading throughout all of Italy. Part of his fame is due to his versatility. Yes, we're very proud of him. Perhaps the Cavalier Traviggi is unacquainted with the fact... ...that milady is a patroness of all the arts. A great deal of Cellini's work in the future... ...is to be accomplished right here in the palace under milady's supervision. Splendid idea! For your own sake don't be any dumber than is absolutely necessary. You just wait till I see the Duke. When we get in here, you keep as far away from me as possible. The further you keep away from me, the better I like it. Ah, here comes our genius now. - And who is that with him? - Oh, um, um... I don't know. Oh, there he is! Don't do that! - Is she waving at someone? - Yes, it looks like it, doesn't it? - I guess it must be Polverino. - Yes! Yes, she's waving to me. And who is she? Oh, she's a model... isn't she? Yes, that's it, she's a model. I met her at Cellini's workshop. They both look a little uncomfortable, perhaps I'd better put them at their ease. Hm, perhaps you should. - Hello, Bumpy. - Shh, not here, not in public. I think you'd better introduce us. Oh... Your Excellency, my model, Angela. How do you do, welcome to the palace. - Oh, this is so silly. - Shh, be quiet. Polverino will instruct you to the etiquette of the court. Well, what are you standing there for? You've got to pay your respects to the Duchess. I think she's a little suspicious. - Of whom? - Well, I... of everything. - Hurry up. - Yes, milord. Who is she? Surely your secret agents who know all... ...must have acquainted you with the lady's identity. Be careful that one day my secret agents don't acquaint you with the executioner. I've been mad with impatience waiting to fly to you, to touch your hand. Might I ask how you dared bring a common little model to this banquet? - I was forced to. - Forced to? - By whom? - By circumstances. It was to... as a shield, to avert suspicion. In the future, my Benvenuto, I will choose your models. Now go, get rid of her. Milady, it's impossible. She has served her purpose, There is no longer any excuse to keep her here. - Be rid of her at once. - But milady... At once! Yes, milady. Are you having a nice time? Milord was correct, the Duchess is suspicious. Yes... it is quite a gathering. - Suspicious of me? - She insists that Angela leave at once. Well, why should she want Angela to leave? Yes, indeed... - I can't imagine. - Why, she's not going to leave. Didn't you tell the Duchess that she was your model? Good evening, Chancellor. It might be better if you explained, milord. You've had more experience in such matters. Yes, of course... I'll explain, I'll tell her something. Milady, there seems to be some confusion. - What confusion? - I mean about Cellini's model. - Why should you want her to leave? - Why shouldn't I? Why, it, it.. it just can't be. Why are you interested? Me? Oh... why should I... It's Cellini, she's not just a model, you know. - Oh, isn't she? - No, she... didn't Cellini tell you? - He did not. - She's more than just a model. - Oh, is she? - Yes, as a matter of fact they're in love. Oh, they are? Oh, it's been going on for a long time. They're going to be married. They are. But I wouldn't mention it if I were you. You really should have told me. I tried to explain, milady. It's no use, Benvenuto, you can't keep it a secret any longer. Keep what a secret, milord? Oh, you know, I told the Duchess all about it. Yes, you should really learn to guard your secrets more carefully, Cellini. - What is the secret, milady? - Come now, don't be bashful. I told her about you and Angela being in love and all that. But milady... His Excellency has made a mistake. I am afraid that you are the one who has made the mistake, Cellini. But surely, milord... I was only jesting, milady. There is nothing to jest about, marriage is a very serious matter. And you, um... Besides, you're placing me in a very peculiar position. - Yes, milord. - Yes... well, I forgive you. Here... come here, Angela. - Don't forget. - Yes, milady, no, milady, yes, milady... This is milady, Angela. Yes, milady. May the Duchess of Florence present her felicitations? - What, milady? - She's a little nervous. Well, I hope you both will be very happy and lead a contented life. - And a long one. - Yes, milady. This is not to be an ordinary banquet, this is to be a wedding feast as well. - Shall we dine, milord? - Yes, I think it would be very nice. - Oh, here... like a pheasant? - No. - Ah, well... an ostrich egg? - Yes. Here... that's nice. You don't seem very comfortable, my Cellini. I have little to make me comfortable, milady. You shouldn't be embarrassed by royalty. You've been entertained in palaces before now. There are many places in the palace where one may be entertained, Ottaviano. Including the dungeon. Oh, yes, milady. Hm, jelly. How like the men of our time. May I offer you some? - Hm? - No, thank you, milady. Delicious! Oh, attention, everybody. We have a great big surprise. Favors for the ladies. - Oh, a lovely necklace. - Yes! Look, look, look. Oh, it was candy all the time. Wasn't that clever? That's my own idea! You should always laugh at jests. It's called etiquette. I'm afraid my appreciation of the Duke's humor is not as great as yours. Well, you might try to be a little cheerful. It's your won wedding feast, you know. The wedding was not of my making. Of course, marriages are made in heaven, aren't they? There may not be a w... There may not be a wedding, milady. True... there may not be. Alessandro! Alessandro! - Yes, milady? - What entertainment have we this evening? Oh, yes, something very special. Um, what is it, er... Oh yes, yes... Some gypsy girls or something. They do a dance... It's called, um... Dance of Death or something silly like that. Ah, even our entertainment is appropriate. Bring on the dancers. My Cellini will not be amused. He will not dine, he will not drink. I am not thirsty, milady. Perhaps I can tempt you with a wine of a better vintage. Steward. Come on, Cellini, drink! Alessandro! Yes? Cellini wishes to toast his bride. Oh... yes... that's right. Toast, everybody. Perhaps milady thinks I am afraid. A toast! To the fairest, the loveliest, the most beautiful woman of all of Florence! Stop! Benvenuto! Benvenuto, my love! I've killed you! Speak to me, my beloved! Speak to me, my beloved! Speak to me. I... we... uh... Uh... clear the hall, everybody! Send everyone away! Gaurds, send them out. Don't look... You'd better go too. I'll see you... some other... Oh... uh... oh... uh... You dare do this to me, the Duke of Florence, in front of my whole court. Oh, to perdition with the court, with you, with everything. Oh, you! You're not going to rule this court any longer. From now on there's only one Duke of Florence and I'm it. I've been suspicious of you for a long while. You're going to pay for this with your own head, milady. I have a witness here to bear me out. Ottaviano, you tell milady that... Now see what you've done. The only cousin I had left. He was all right a little while ago, now look at him. You're going to be punished, both of you! I'll, I'll have you torn... on the... and I'll put you in... I'll boil eggs under your armpits... I'll soak your feet in goats'... - You mustn't get excited, Bumpy... - What? Are you... - You might get apoplexy, Bumpy... - Don't... Bumpy. Bumpy, is it? I begin to see the light. Oh... uh... what light, milady? So you're going to have my head, are you? Well... anybody is likely to get excited. So there's to be but one Duke of Florence from now on, is there? I never said anything of the kind! If you can joke, I don't see why I can't joke too. Well, if milord offers no objections, I think I shall return to the winter palace tonight. Me, object? Oh, of course not. Perhaps it would be best if I took Cellini with me. There's a new fountain needed in the courtyard, he should start work on it at once. Yes, of course. - Good night, milady. - Good night, milord. I... I meant... I was... Good night. - Subtitles - Lu?s Filipe Bernardes
