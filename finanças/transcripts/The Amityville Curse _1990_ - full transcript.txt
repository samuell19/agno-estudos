Got him! Mrs. Moriarty... Are you trying to scare the wits out of me? I do beg your pardon I'm sure, Father, but you know, confession starts in a few minutes. My new parishioners are waiting. Yes, yes. I know. Mrs. Moriarty... Would you check the windows upstairs? It's a bit chilly here, isn't it? Yes, Father. You don't suppose a rat has a soul, do you, Father? I'm ready. Who are you? What do you want? Who are you? Oh, my God. Overcast skies today, folks, with an expected high of 55 degrees and some showers expected later in the afternoon. So don't forget those sweaters and umbrellas. Should be clearing later in the day with only a 30 percent chance... No, I wanna catch the weather. Weather report for the Tri-County area... Continued cloudy and cold. I don't hear any hustle out there. If we hit the rush, we'll miss the agent. He's gonna be there at 9:00, sharp. I'm hurrying. The place is in Amityville, we gotta take the Long Island Expressway. ...percent chance of rain. The long range forecast predicts a continuation of this chilly weather. The low pressure range coming... This is Amityville. The house is about a mile away on the other side of town. Marvin, turn right after the bridge. What? Right... Here. Turn, Marvin. This is ridiculous. What is this, Debbie? Another one of your premonitions? Stop. What? What is it? I know this house. This isn't even the right block. Marvin... It's for sale. Hey... I smell an opportunity. I know this house. Look at the size of this place. It's enormous. I wonder how much they want for it. I know this house, Marvin. We have to get some partners who have some money. Bill... You never listen to me, Marvin. Bill's making money with his restaurant. And Abby. Abby just married that lawyer, didn't she, Debbie? Of course, I'm gonna have to handle the deal. And the market is so hot on Long Island right now. We can just fix it up and advertise it in Manhattan. I've seen this house before in a dream. We have some little fixer upper, huh? So, this is Amityville. Hey, Marv. There must be something wrong with this place, huh? Some minor repairs. Nothing a little elbow grease won't cure. How'd we get it so cheap, Marvin? Brilliant negotiating. Pure and simple. Bet it's more like psychological torture. Hey, Abby, when's the big unveiling? No, wait a minute I'm not finished with it yet. I'm gonna work on it this weekend. You're gonna paint? When I'm not renovating. Oh, don't tell me a minor repair job, Marvin. So, what do you think? You're sure someone's not still living here? Look at this furniture. All part of the deal. Even the curtains. Marvin, will you help us, please? Absolutely, Bill. Hey, where's the easel? Where's Debbie? What do you think, sweetheart? Your money. Yeah, mine too. Now I'd like to get a better look at what I bought into. Called ConEd myself just a week ago. It must be a bad switch. We need power for this thing, Marvin. Yeah, Marvin. How brilliant are you with negotiating with the powers of darkness? Very funny. Anybody got a flashlight? Look what I found. Ask and you shall receive. This is great furniture. I told you it's a bargain. Why is it all covered up? Marvin, this is kind of weird. Who's that? In here! I'm in the kitchen! Careful. This place bites. Are you okay, honey? I thought I heard something. I'm sorry. At least it's not broken. It's just twisted, I'll be all right. Debra... She'll be fine, Marv. I've got an ACE bandage in my first aid kit. I could use one of your pain killers though, Marvin. Oh, boy. What a start to our little paint and plaster party. Great house you found us, Marvin. You never did explain why they moved out. What? The family who lived here. Look at this. They left their furniture and everything. They must have left in a hurry. It's really strange, isn't it? I think they were superstitious. I played on that in the negotiations. I think they just wanted to get rid of the house. Things are usually cheap for a reason. I volunteered for this. Ah. This doesn't make sense. Ow! Ow! What's going on down there? There's no water pressure, Marvin. What is it, Marvin? What? Smells like something crawled in there and died. That's the third cigarette in a row. Last I heard, you were gonna quit. That's right. Okay. What's that? Huh? Don't move. Don't. No, don't. What're you doing? Ah. We got water, William. Rust. Definitely not my color. Oh, baby. Let's get Debbie to read Bill's fortune. Don't you think this is a little childish? Now, where are the fortune cookies? They are in the chow mien. So, what does mine say? Okay. Um... Something about surprises. "Expect the unexpected." That counts. Don't you think, Marv? It's the law of averages. They print the same fortunes four or five times over. Don't encourage her. Hey. I've got something here that no one expected. Ta-da! You got them back. That was a gorgeous dress. Let's see where we were all hammered on the dance floor. Hey, speak for yourself, Billy Boy. I happen to be a great dancer. It has to do with, uh, body language. There is no mistaking what it's saying now, Abigail. I sense a lesson in behavioral science coming up. Okay, okay. We really should ease off on Marvin here. You know, if it weren't for him, we wouldn't have the pleasure of being assembled here tonight, in our fabulous house in need of... ...minor repairs.Minor repairs. I heard there's a Holiday Inn down the road, you're welcome to stay there. Oh! And miss all this fun? Mock me now, thank me later. My mother used to say that. My mother never said anything. Daddy wouldn't give her a chance. Hey, there's that scratching sound. I told you, rats. Big ones. Excuse me. I have to go to the bathroom. Here, you'd better take this. Remember at our wedding we tried to fool my mother into thinking she was Jewish? Kitty? How about you, Frank? You're awfully quiet over there. Where'd you grow up? Around. I moved around a lot as a teenager. No, before that. I mean, your formative years. No telling dramas of parents and puberty? My past, it's just a dream. Doesn't exist anymore. I understand that. It's called selective memory. You block out problems from childhood. I've seen a lot of cases like that. Let's just say my past is not worth remembering. Kitty? There's one left. Must be yours, Marvin. There's nothing there. Well, the man with no future meet the man with no past. Yes. It's very, very droll. That was just spectacular, Bill. On the other hand, Marvin, you are a humorous individual. Afraid of the dark. This is silly. There is a cat in the basement. This place is full of surprises. Well, how about a toast, everybody? To love, everlasting. To the newlyweds. Any children in their future, Deb? William. To good friends. To doubling our money. To the house. To the house. Oh, my God, Abby. It doesn't even hurt. Oh, God. Billy, please be careful. Careful, Bill.BILL: Okay, okay. Just hold it. Marvin, where are those famous pain killers of yours? ♪ I know it's a sin ♪ I've got you How's your hand, Abby? It still hurts a bit. But you can make it feel better. You know, I think we should move to the Holiday Inn. Oh, no, baby. It's romantic here. You will get the power going, first thing in the morning. Besides... You don't need an old furnace to keep you warm, huh. ♪ Hallelujah ♪ Hallelujah Hallelujah ♪ Hmm. Now I know why he's never got married. Classic anal retentive. What do you think I heard, Marvin? What? Marvin? You're not listening to me. The doctor is in. It's just a feeling. I don't know what. I think there's something else in the house. Mmm-hmm. And you're sure this is one of your ESP impressions again, or is it just a dream? I swear I heard a voice coming from the basement. It was as if it was trying... It's probably the cat making a noise. Debra, look, you've hurt yourself, you've been under a lot of stress, you're taking medication, we're in the strange place. You don't understand. I don't think you want to. We've been through this before. Are you keeping the journal I asked you to keep? I mean, don't you see some pattern in this? You're with your friends here, Debra. Believe me you're safe in this house. Kitty. Come on. Calm down. Stop it right now. Just, just take a deep breath. Breathe, breathe, breathe. Okay, that's right. There's something evil in this house! Debbie, write it down. Somebody try the power! There is nothing! Damn! Try again! There's still nothing! Marvin? Are you all right? Aside from the fact that you could have killed me, huh? What's going on? I almost nailed Marvin. Don't you know how to use that thing? I don't see how I could have missed. Maybe I just need a bit more practice. Hey, everybody. Check this out. What is it? You tell me. Wow! It's so life-like. No. Mmm-mmm. No way that thing's staying here. I don't know. Just might make the house show better. Maybe I should put it in your bedroom. A feeler with visions. Yes. Yes. Pardon me? Can we help you? Oh, I'm not the one that needs the help. But maybe I can help you. You're hurting, but you'll be fine. Just who are you? What's your name, dear? Debbie. She's Debbie. I know who she is, I mean who... Oh, yeah, Moriarty. Mrs. Moriarty. That's two "R's" and one "I." It's not real, dear. It's fake. Better to keep an eye out. Hey, you got a glass here for my eye? Hey, Frank. We've got company. Someone you really ought to meet. You can't stay away, can you? Always know where to look for you when you wander off. Oh, that's good beer. I don't think they have that down at Daugherty's. Don't think so anyway. What's that? Uh, Daugherty's Bar and Grill. Tonight's a big night down there. Saturday shindig. Just, uh, why are you here anyways? A miracle of birth I suppose. The Lord works in mysterious ways. Weird. Certifiable. Look, Mrs. Moriarty, as you can see, we've really got a lot of work to do here. All will be revealed. I don't mean to be rude, but... This time, for certain, I can tell. The Lord works in mysterious ways. See? I have something for you. I know I brought it. Well, I've got work to do anyways. What in the hell is wrong with that thing? Frank! Get inside! Hurry! What did you do to that animal, Frank? Did you see its eyes? Is it gone? I don't see it. Oh, my God! Don't anybody move. Tell that to the dog. What was that all about? I don't know. Maybe we should call SPCA. If we had a phone. It's over. Everybody's hungry, huh? Bill, you got anything in that cooler besides tofu and sprouts? Any dog food? Nothing kills your appetite, huh, Marvin? What the hell! It was a stray dog pissed off at Frank's looks. That's all. Give us a smile, William. Let's see how much you enjoy your work. Hey, watch it! That stove isn't replaceable! What about the furnace? What? The furnace! That's Debbie's job. She's putting down the finish. Watch that stuff, it's dangerous. You missed a spot... To your right. Marvin, you're making me nervous. Spielberg! Stop screwing around, get back to work! Very funny. Very funny. So, did you get the furnace working? I just got the lights working, Marvin. I can't believe how much usable stuff there is here. This really was an incredible deal. God! They spread disease, you know! There's probably a whole damn nest of them. Big ones. Breeders. Marvin, there's a door here. So, what do you think is in there besides a pack of diseased rats? I'm ready for them.Yeah? Come on. I think we're safe. I don't see any beady red eyes. So, why don't you check to make sure there's no more rats in here? I'll go check on Deb. Marvin Schwarzenegger. Damn. Oh, no! Marvin! Marvin! So? Now, what're you two trying to tell me? That this house has some sort of supernatural something, huh? Ghosts, goblins... Come on, William, I never expected you to fall for this sort of bogeyman garbage. Then you explain what happened, professor. Everything has an explanation. You've just got to approach the situation in a rational sort of way. Not let your imagination run away with you. Right. I imagined all that. Basement draft's plain and simple. Oh, come on. Why don't we just get out of here for a while? Have a few drinks. Yeah. I could use a couple. Almost ready? I dreamt about religious symbols. A church. But look at this. That was two weeks before Bill found the things in the basement. I'm telling you, there's a connection. Debbie, please. Not now! We need some distance... ...perspective. We'll talk about it tomorrow. I'll be downstairs. Marvin's looking for you. I don't wanna leave you alone here. No, you go. I'm best left alone when this happens. No, I can stay downstairs and work on the painting. No, it'll pass! You just go. At least one of us should have a good time. Okay. Oh! Bill got the fridge working, and there is some chicken in there if you're hungry. I'll be back early. I could have sworn the guy said to turn "just beyond the next light." We found the place. Okay, Marvin? Welcome to Daugherty's, folks. Nice to see new faces. Hi. What sort of wines do you have? Red and white. Just bring us a pitcher of Coors Light and four glasses. Miss, where's the restroom? Second right past the bar. I'm gonna call the Blue Goose, see if I'm still in the restaurant business. Well, this place kinda remind you of a certain student hangout? What was the name of that place? What? Wasn't it Sullivan's or Mulligan's or something like that? Culligan's, that was it. Yeah, we closed that place down a couple of times, didn't we? Abby? Yeah. You don't think I'm crazy, do you? No. No. Hmm. I've got it. Oh, no charge, ladies. Compliments of Mrs. Moriarty. You don't really think she's gonna come over here, do you? You don't like her, do you? She gives me the creeps. Well, I mean, it's not that big a deal being a psychologist. I mean, you learn a lot about people, you try to help people with their problems. I do the best I can. Here's to my assistant manager. The Blue Goose is turning down reservations. I'll be right back. Hey, Billy, tell me something. Do you really buy into all this spirit in the house stuff, you know? No, I do not buy it. I know such stories are rampant around here. Let me ask you. Have either of you gentlemen ever witnessed firsthand, a verifiable paranormal event? Let me put it this way. Are you familiar with mass hysteria? You're looking a mite peaked, dear. Ain't you feeling well? You scared me. I seem to have that effect on a lot of folks around here. But they ain't seen what I've seen. My visions don't come from here, you know. They come from somewhere else. What're you talking about? In life, he opened his house to the sinner. And in death, he still compels the sinner to come. And he works through you. What is this? When that boy killed his family, he was possessed. This town is full of a lot of strange things. Is that a fact! Like that old house you and your friends bought. That old house is not just bricks and boards. It's got a soul, that house. I think what it's got is a lot of townspeople starting to believe their own tall tales. Plain and simple. So, who wants another beer? I'll tell you one thing plain and simple, mister. You don't know shit. Frank? Sweetheart? Where are you, sweetheart? Frank! They're back. They're back again, the pain, those whispers. Don't ever leave me. Shh. Come on, breathe. Just breathe and relax. Nice cold... It's okay. Nice cold bath. It's the only thing that used to get rid of them. I remember that as a kid. That's the only thing that I absolutely remember. Yes, I know. Don't worry, honey. I'm here now. 1-1-1. 1-1-1. I just told him to stay in bed as long as he wanted. I'm worried, Marvin. He was yelling and cursing all night long. I don't know what's happening to him. Migraines will do that. I know a couple of specialists I can recommend. Morning. Oh, do you want some coffee? Uh, no, thanks. Maybe after I get back from my run. Do you need anything from the 7-Eleven? I'm gonna stock up on Raid. No, as a matter of fact, we were just gonna go in search of fresh bagels and The Sunday Times. Is there anything you need? Is Deb all right? She seemed pretty weirded out when we got home last night. She's okay. A few minutes ago, she was still sleeping. How about you? I had a rough night, too. I don't like being alone up there. I could use a good woman. Well, let me see what I can do. Does she have her own sleeping bag? 1-1-1. What does that mean? Tell me! What are you trying to tell me? Anybody home? Kitty ran away again last night. Where is everybody? I guess they heard I was coming. Kitty. Kitty, are you down here in the basement? Who's in there? Father. Father. He's here, Father. I can feel him. "1-1-1." Born November first. Eleven one. Not one eleven. One. Please, what is it? Merciful God. It's you. Please, what is it? What is it? It's hers. Oh, damn. Would you mind not smoking? I'll be upstairs. Mrs. Moriarty was a church secretary when this place was a rectory. A rectory? Didn't they tell you anything when you bought this old house? I... I wasn't particularly interested at the time in the details of its history. So, what did they milk you for this old place anyhow? Want a mint? No. Never got to know the new priest. Not alive anyway. You said she was here yesterday? She came by in the morning. What's this about a priest? Mmm. Father Percheos. Killed. Murdered. In his own confessional. The priest was, was murdered here? No, not here. Church around the corner. Hard to believe all this stuff is still here after 12 years. Whoever did it was confessing his sins. Shot him point blank. Right between the eyes. 9:00 on a Sunday night, too. Can you imagine that? Archdiocese had to close the church after that. They moved what they could down here. Lots of the priest's stuff, too. No family... Well, none that we could find anyway. Some say that everything about this place is cursed. My bet is that old lady started that one. She, sort of, came unscrewed after she found the body. That's funny. I know I didn't shoot the whole tape. I'll send somebody by tomorrow to bring the tape back, okay? But I'm sure we'll be leaving today. Excuse me, sir, but a woman did die here. And we may have a couple of questions. Krabel, I'll talk to you Yes, sir.ay? About the priest, you said... "Whoever did it." Don't you know? Didn't you catch the killer? Well, from what Mrs. Moriarty told us, we picked up this half-wit neighborhood kid who was always getting in trouble. But we found him hiding in that oak tree over there. Wasn't hard to do, because fool dog was running around below. So, they did catch the killer. Well, we think so. Trouble is... He hung himself the next night before we could get a confession out of him. No. Debra, you're not supposed to be out here. It's okay, Inspector. She'll be okay. The boy... Marvin, the... Are you okay, Deb? Come on. Come on, sweetheart. It's okay. That's the boy. Debra, it was dark, she lost her footing. She shouldn't have been in the house in the first place. She was drawn here like I was drawn here. It brought us here, Marvin. It? What is "it"? The house. Something about the house. It's been trying to communicate ever since we got here. Even before, in my dreams. I won't listen to this nonsense.The church... Confessional. Blood everywhere. You are hysterical. Mrs. Moriarty said it was working through me... ...for justice. You have to listen to me. Something's horribly wrong here. Debra... Debbie! What about the boy? How could I have seen him? Even known about him? He's been dead for 12 years. Mmm. I'm in the tub. Is that you, Frank? You know, Marv, this thing really sounded like a good idea. I'd like you to look at something. It's Debbie's journal. But it's not Debbie's writing. It's been a while since I've tried to translate Latin. Best I can make out, there's bits and pieces of Bible passages. Something that looks like it's from an absolution. Or an exorcism. Exorcism? I know what this is. Fifth Commandment. "Honor Thy Father..." You're the psychologist. What's all this mean? It means I'm losing her, Bill. I don't know what to do. You can do what I'm doing. Pack. We're getting the hell out of here. You can't just walk out like this! What's Frank gonna say? I hope you don't think I'm driving you. Not with that flat tire, you won't. What? Get your keys, we'll change it. Let's go, Marvin. I haven't got a spare. Look, the guy was... He said the tires were good. Listen to me, Marvin. We're not staying here tonight. You got it? Look, we can take off that tire, and I'll go borrow Bill's scooter, and we're gonna find some service station somewhere, and we're gonna fix the damn thing. Now, you guys get everything packed. And when I get back, we're gone. Understand? Well, I suppose we can come and work next week. Hey, man. I mean, what's gonna happen before you open up your eyes? Were we all dreaming at the same time? Look, when I get back, we're out of here. This house is history! Damn! Frank? Is that you? Can I help you? I got flat tire. That's no problem.Thanks. Come on inside. Mrs. Moriarty? Is it you out there? I'm listening. I'm ready. Who are you? What do you want? Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. So have you, you son of a bitch. Open the door. Whoever you are, let me out of here. Father... Why has God forsaken me? Why? Oh, my God. You abandoned us. You denied me. Your own flesh. My own father. What'd you have told Mother? That you'd fill her with the burning love of God? That you would hold her, that you would never leave her? Now, listen to me, my son. Don't you dare call me that! You sinner. Sinner, sinner, sinner... Man of God. Poor Godless child, you don't even know my name. Oh, please. Forgive me, forgive me. Please, I'm begging you. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Father? I bet you never thought I'd find you here after all these years... I'm here to help you account for your sins. Keep your promise into eternity... In sickness and in health. Mommy no longer lives. Those whispers are almost over. But she needs someone. Amen. Instant replay. Father... Turn it up. Father... Well, check this out. I didn't even know there was any audio on here until I... I worked a little magic with these fingers... Shh! It came, Father... The prodigal... It's you. Damn! Oh, my God. No. No! Don't leave me alone, Marvin. Don't go away. Frank! Frank? What in the name of God? What are you doing? Frank... It's me. It's Debbie. Please, Frank. I'm your friend, Frank. Bill, help me! Bill, help me! Together... Forever in eternity. No! Bill! Bill! We gotta get out. Bill, it's Frank! He killed Marvin. Bill, we gotta get out of here. Oh, no, Bill. Help! Somebody help! Help me! Somebody, please help me! Debbie! Come on, guys. Let's go. Oh, my God. What happened? Frank. What've you done? Frank. Till death do us part. Hey, I told you. Nothing until we get a handle on this thing. Move along, buddy.If we ever do. Christ! It's starting all over again. Just when the tourists were coming back, too. What is that? This? Does it belong to you? No. It belongs to the house.
