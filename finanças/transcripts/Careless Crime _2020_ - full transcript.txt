Negar eskandarfar presents based on a true criminal case We could have put in more. We've added three rows. We can't do more. Why not? Of course you can. There. See? There's too much space here. 115 centimetres. - How did you measure that? - Here. If you take it from the back here, you have to do the same there. 104. It's still too much. - You need leg room. - Leg room? Here it is. More than enough. Nobody's taller than me. He's taller than you. We're in the auditorium. We've been waiting for you for an hour. His height isn't standard. We need to do this according to standards. Like a plane. His height isn't even standard for a plane. You can't find this kind of seat anymore. For now, we can put benches between those two rows. And a few chairs and stools on the sides. We'll take care of this part later. You mean we have to take them off and put them back again? Think about tomorrow. Seriously, kazem. What's the capacity right now? It was 500, now it's 700. I want 1000. When do you need it by? I wanted to have it ready for careless crime. But it's going to cinema Iran. Going to Iran? Here you are. Here's crime. That officer next to the driver wants to park his car. He doesn't see his daughter in the mirror and hits her. From then on, he can't see anything in a mirror. Why aren't they talking? Fast forward it to where they talk! The cinema burned down. The wiring was old and unsafe. The capacity was not standard due to the new seating layout. The only exit door was stuck. The doors suspiciously lacked handles. The doors opened inwards, the lack of handles led to people being crushed. By the time smoke alerted the crowd, there was no time to escape. The investigation of the debris indicates arson. The projection booth burst into flames. It had been doused in petrol. None of the cinema employees were present during the fire. The fire engine arrived late with an empty water tank. The doors had been locked from the outside. The only open door was blocked by a pile of bodies. Only eight managed to escape the inferno. Careless crime We don't have it. Can I buy it somewhere else? No, you won't find it. Nowhere? It's unavailable because of the sanctions. Medicine isn't under sanctions. Let me see the prescription. - Is it the last item? - Yes. This isn't essential medicine. Non-essential drugs are under sanction. Who is it for? For me. How long have you been taking this? For a few years. But you don't look like you have a problem. What's your problem? Are there other pharmacies nearby? Wait a second. What's your diagnosis? Nerves. No, be specific. Fire. Did you set a fire? Yes, four years ago. Forty? Impossible. No, three or four years ago. It's called pyromania, not fire. Wait a second. Here. Do you know the cinema museum? Do you know where it is? Yes, I do. Go there and ask for abdollah bagha. He works at the museum. Who? - He works there. - Okay. You'll see him when you get there. Give him that note and you'll get your medicine. Okay. It's market prices though. - How much? - Depends on the dollar exchange rate. Okay.

Ticket please, sir. Hello, sir. Are they with you? Sir, can we go out to the drinking fountain? We'll be back soon. Go, but be careful. They're with me. Cast: Babak karimi, adel yaraghi mohamadali sareban, behzad dorani fariba kamran, siavash cheraghipour Abolfazl kahani, razieh mansouri masoomeh beygi, golnoosh ghahramani, elaheh bakhshi, mahmoud behraznia, ariya taghipourian, meysam damanzeh, mohamad rabani the government was against an increase in ticket prices. Therefore, cinemas had to install extra seats. Some cinemas decided to begin strike actions. But because they were sporadic, the strikes didn't last. The only solution for cinemas was to increase capacity. This is why cinema Rex in abadan was so crowded when it was set on fire during the revolution. This fire had been carefully-planned and was an evident organised arson. The doors had been deliberately locked to turn the cinema into a human oven. This incident led to further protests against the shah and helped the victory of our magnificent revolution... May I have your attention, please? Come over here. Come. We're going downstairs to see the puppets. In 1979, six months before the revolution, four people entered cinema Rex, in abadan, and set it on fire during a screening of the deer, an Iranian classic starring superstar behrouz vosoughi, to protest against the shah and western influences on culture. 478 people lost their lives, including three of the arsonists. The only survivor of the group was arrested after the revolution. Although his defence argued that they didn't intend to cause any deaths, he was convicted of murder and executed. This incident is known in Iran as the crime of cinema Rex. Sir, the children left. I'm looking for abdollah bagha. - Who? Does he work here? - They told me he's here. Shall I have him paged? No, it's okay. - Have you checked downstairs? - Where? They're taking down a theatre set, he might be there. How do I get there? Follow me. This way. Hi. They're gone. Did I scare you? The one upstairs isn't me, it's my twin sister. Your friends are leaving. Who? - Who are you looking for? - Abdollah bagha. Are you looking for medicine? They're still in the alley, you can catch them. Behind the museum. Not that way. This way. Which way? Follow me. This way. Abdollah, someone's here for you. Did you want to talk to me? I can tell what you're after by its colour. Can you afford it? I have money. I charge in dollars. - I don't have any dollars. - I buy it in dollars too. - Where do I get the dollars? - I don't know. I pay in dollars. I want my pills. Wait a second. There you go. Your pills. I need you to do something in return. Do what? Take this to my friend. Don't worry, it's just paper. Take this to my friend faraj. His name and address are there. - Is that all? - Don't forget the pills. Abdollah, we're waiting for you! Okay, stop! How is that possible? He just makes thing up. He's also written about the deer. Why is that film called the deer? That's a misunderstanding. The real title is the dear. You're joking? It's the deer! Why the deer? Because of the antlers. The more they grow, the harder it gets for the deer to hide. - Is it tusi's analysis? - No, zaven's. - Hello! - How are you? - Good to see you. - Hi! Haven't you gone in yet? - Where's your soulmate? - Have you broken up? - Shut up! - Come on, dump him! - Was there a guard at the gate? - No, why? We heard they might come and stop the screening, she's worried. No, it'll be fine. I'll go in, see you later. Negar, are you okay? Yes, I'm fine. The last time I saw a film here, there was still the open-air cinema. Where did they project the film? There. See that hole in the wall? The booth was there. Why have you brought all this? To put up on the cinema walls. - Why should you do it? - Who else? Someone has to bring them. Be careful. Don't let them exploit you. Stop nagging! I'm the only one you nag. - You have to double-park. - I can see. - At least fix the mirror. - I don't need it. You're going to bump into him. Let me concentrate. You're going to hit it! It's a Mercedes! Just be quiet for a second. There are empty parking spaces a bit further on. Damn! It's your fault! - You touched the Mercedes! - What? - The Mercedes. You touched it. - Mind your own business. Park it yourself. Me? I don't know how! You know enough to criticise me! The bumper is dented. We'll have a good laugh. I told her not to park here. Whose car is it? Someone in this building. Don't touch us up and we won't touch you. It's our own business. You made me nervous with the Mercedes. Go ahead, I'll guide you. See? Just like your dad. I'll guide you. The handbrake. Go on. Slower. Watch that side. Go right. To the right. Good, stop here. Stop. Now, a sharp left. Turn to the left. No. Ok. Come on. No, the other way. Turn that way. Go on. That's fine. The other way round. Turn it. This way, good. Great. Come on. Now a sharp turn. - See what you've done? - Don't let him... Come on, come on. The idiot! Ok, that's enough. Hey, pretty boy! Why didn't you help me? - Mum... - You didn't give me a chance... - You'd rather show off to a young girl! - Please, mum! We'll have a good laugh when the Mercedes owner comes. Did we ask for his help? - Stop it! - We'll laugh at you. Thank you, anyway. - Why are you arguing with him? - Do we need his help? Why thank him then? I was just being polite. Why did you park anyway? I can just pop out. He's going to send me the location. You don't even know where you're going? He'll send it soon. Don't go to his place. Who's the mother here? - Promise me. - Promise what? Not to go to his place. He's a decent guy, you know. They look like a sex symbol on Instagram, and then a minger shows up. - But I've already met him. - You said you hadn't. Well, I've seen him virtually, as you call it. What's wrong with mingers? I like them. Who says "virtually"? Isn't it what you guys say? - Do you need a hand? - No. You do say "virtually"! Leave before the Mercedes guy comes. I will. - Is Ali here? - Hello, elham. - Hi, is he here? - He arrived a while ago. You're late. Fazli, where can I find him? He's in the auditorium, checking things. I've got two tickets booked for careless crime. You have to wait. The printer's out of paper. - So? - We have to wait for the tickets. Kazem, can I give these posters to you? I'm busy. Has mr ramezani seen them? - Let's go sit there. - Okay. It's good. See how it directs your gaze across? But it's plagiarised from that classic momayez poster. Just with different faces. That was the plan, didn't you know? - Your boss thinks he's the new momayez? - What? You know momayez, right? The artist who designed the original. Go hand it in yourself. Naderi should see this. Mr ramezani, this has already been approved. I want to see the film now! The film's not starting yet. Go hand it in. We have to wait for the tickets. Kazem, can I hand you these posters? I'm busy. Has mr ramezani seen them? Do you know which film was made first: Ravage or the eagles? These are the flyers for that crime film. I'll leave them here. - What is it? - You mean the story? Another crime? Boring... This one is careless. "Mohsen, a high-ranking army officer who has carelessly..." Here it is... Run his own daughter over, "is so in shock about not having seen her "that he thinks he's lost his ability to see reflections in the mirror. Until..." Both films were made in 84. But pillage opened first. - Did you really know that? - Of course. Cool! Do you know a good orthopaedic surgeon? Yes, I know one. Why? Just testing you. Now another question: I have a date tonight. Should I go to the theatre with him or ask him to come here for a movie? How old are you? How old do I look? Old enough. Exactly. So get him to come here for a movie. Get him here then... Excuse me, sir. Excuse me. Do you mind if we sit there? There's only one empty seat. Could you please let them pass? Seats 9 and 10. There were ten checkpoints. What are they looking for? Who knows? They search under the seats, in the boot, everywhere. I told my mum they were after books. As she's been traumatised by searches, she set all my dad's books and magazines on fire. Where did she do that? In the yard. That's her favourite place. My dad had a collection of this old women's magazine. She burned it because one issue had a red cover and a photo of the shah. Funny. Is this an art house film? Philistine! Are we really going to spend two hours watching this? I hate any film that has this Laurel sign on it. What Laurel sign? The festival logo. For this kind of film. You've changed something. What is it? - Does it look good? - Let me see. - The film... - Hasn't started yet. Careless crime a film by shahram mokri a Jeep is coming this way! Is it military? I can't tell if it's green or blue. - Go see who they are. - Yes, sir! If he takes off the wing mirrors, we 'ii crash. Why does he do that? - For now, we've got a flat tire. - Our lives are at stake! Don't worry. I 'ii drive. Go ask if they've got a spare tyre. - Did they call? - No. - The guy with the bike's here? - No. - Why? - He was scared, I let him go. He had to sign a report. He doesn't care about an unexploded missile. It's one of ours. It's been here for a couple of decades. It was probably targeting daesh, Syria, Iraq, but landed here instead. There's arabic writing on it. - That's not arabic. - What is it then? No idea. Another language. - What other language? - I don't know. Arabic. - Come here. - Where? Here. I'd rather you came here. It's a bit difficult for me. Listen. Have you got a compass? The boy's phone might have one. What do you need it for? I want to see if it first landed straight or if it was leaning from the start. It's a little slope. I know it's a slope now. I want to see if it was straight before the landslide. - What's that car? - Where? They must have a spare tyre. Will their spare fit our car? It's a Jeep too. From here, it looks straight. What do you mean, straight? It's a slope, can't you see? Missiles fall straight down, right? When it falls straight, it explodes. Exactly. Brilliant. This one was on a slope, so it didn't explode. I just wonder why neither the impact nor the landslide could blow it up. It's been defused. The guy with the bike said he'd heard something over there. And the landslide is visible. It's been defused. You mean they defused it and just left it there? There was a war on. They were busy. What makes you think it's from wartime? Do you know how this is defused? Through the tip. The bit that's stuck deep in the ground. Colonel, he says he's carrying cargo. Am I a colonel now? - What's your cargo? - A generator. Let him answer. A generator. - Do you have a spare tyre? - Why are you asking? Why do you think? We've got a flat tyre. Mine wouldn't fit your car. - How many screws does it have? - Mine has five, yours six. - Don't you screw with us. - Of course not. Call Tehran, and tell them we can't spend the night here. Yes, sir. - Where are you taking that? - Up there, for some girls. To the broom spring. - Where's broom spring? - It's a spring... Up on the broom hill. Everything is broom here. It's the name of the area. Why are you taking this? - For the travellers. - For the girls. Do people travel around here? Broom spring is a tourist attraction. He says a few girls are camping up there to watch films. To watch films? They watch films. In the middle of the mountain. What do they watch? That's a good generator. It's made in Japan. Take your cap. You can't buy one like this nowadays. This one belongs to the clinic. Yesterday, I took it to bardia's wedding and now to broom spring. Bardia? That's a very urban name. Soon, every boy name will end in "a": Bardia, pouria, masiha... Aria! So, that's what you do for a living? Not always. Sometimes. - Went to a wedding last night? - Yes, my friend's. - When did this land here? - He says around 8. This? It fell during the wedding. How do you know? Didn't Aziz tell you how he found it? Who's Aziz? The guy with the bike who reported it. Did the ground shake? It didn't fall because of an earthquake. It was when the band was playing. - What band? - Musicians. The band came. They had a little device, no instruments. They pressed a pedal and it played music. It made noise. Around 8, they switched from persian to kurdish music, but it wasn't in sync. The device made a very loud noise. And there was also a noise from here. Aziz was here and saw this thing. Sir! - Captain! - Yes? They'll send someone tomorrow. We have to stay. Stay until tomorrow? There's nowhere to stay! - They'll be here by noon. - But I have lots to do... An expert will come from Tehran. Can I go? The travellers are waiting. What travellers? The girls in broom spring. The generator's for them. They're just travellers! And they said nothing about this big thing here? Apparently, they've investigated. The only bomb that ever fell here blew up in 86. That's just hearsay. A team came here to defuse it, but they failed and it exploded. - When? - Back in 1986. Well, the 86 blew up and is gone now. This one is here now in 2020. Is there a place we can stay the night? You say it's touristy and there's nowhere we can stay? It's not really for tourists, but for travellers. Okay, can we stay with these travellers? Look! Call them back and say we can't spend the night here. What if this blows up? Jalal! - How's it going? Looks busy outside. - It is. Someone called and said if we show the film, they'll burn us to the ground. Screw them! Exactly. Here's what I said: "What's wrong with you? You threaten us no matter what we show: Nude films, leftist films..." Leftist? Never say that again! Do you even do your job? There's an inch of dust on every surface. Sorry. They said for a nude film, no-one would call. When they call, just hang up. What are you doing with your teeth? My wife says they're rusty. She's right. Stop sucking on this damn thing! Get back to work. Mr naderi! What should I do with these? No idea. Why don't you give them to Mina? Hamid! - Mina? - My niece. She's in my office. Give them to her, to the reception, or put them up. There's loads of space! Just wanted to let you know. I'm off to the screening. Okay. Go and I'll send someone to take these. - Where did you unload these? - At the backdoor. Make sure they're not blocking the door, in case inspectors show up. There isn't enough space. Do your work. It's the emergency exit. And you, mind you own business. Has the film started? - You have a ticket? - Yes. - Where did you get it? - At the front door. Hurry up. The door on the left. Guys, let's go. Tickets, please. Go buy tickets, sharpish! Four tickets. What price range? Three toman ones. Ice cream, sandwiches, fruit juice, cigarettes... Get your snacks and make your way to the auditorium. The film is about to start. Our upcoming movie is the imperilled. What film is this? The deer. Not the preview. What film are we going to see? What's the film called? I don't know. Wait a second, you'll find out. I think it's samad. Give me your bottle. You too, give me the bottle. - Why? - Give it to me. Fallah and I will go douse the place. Then you go light the match. Light that match and it's all done. Setareh? Come here. The guy is here. But he's not alone. - Who's with him? - No idea. - Did you bring it? - Yes, it's in the Van. - Hi! - This way. So this is the famous broom spring, and here are the girls. - Are you here for a wedding? - No, why? - What are you doing in this desert? - This isn't a desert. - Who are you? - This is captain mohsen motii. - Of the police? - The army. - Are you searching for alcohol? - Don't you know this uniform? He's not wearing a uniform. We're here because of that. Hope you don't mind. Are you looking for something specific? No worries. It's a security issue. What do you do with this? We project films on it. That's what it's for. That's the tourist attraction. There's a story behind it. - What's the story? - The story? I don't know. The story's about the film we're planning to show. - What's the story? - How should we know? So that's why you need a generator. I want to know when you arrived here. - This morning. - Early morning. - What time? - 9 am. - Is nine early? - What are you doing? It's early for us. Come here for a second, please. What were you doing just now? - Right at this moment? - We were waiting for the generator. Waiting doesn't count. What were you doing? How can you project in this daylight? We were practicing. For what? - Preparing for tomorrow. - For what? What's going on tomorrow? Our friends are joining us for the screening. - So that's what you were doing. - Right. Okay. Continue practicing. Pretend we're not here. - So we should practice? - Yes. What do you mean? We need to corroborate your statements. What were you practicing? Watching films? No, we were practicing sending messages. It's just a trick we do for fun. Not exactly for fun. These people think everything is for fun. - You start practicing, we'll see. - Sure. Sit down, we're watching a film! I doused the entire wall next to the drinking fountain. It's your turn now. Get going. Sit down. Stop walking. You want me to make you sit? Just as it was getting interesting... Didn't I tell you to go before? I need a wee. But it's just started. We're missing the important part. I don't need a wee. I swear I'm not taking you out again. I don't want to go. Stay here. Come on, morteza, let's go back in. What happened? It didn't catch fire. - Did you try the other side? - It didn't work. Let's go. Now, four of them! Having a stroll? - What happened? - It didn't catch fire. - You said you'd done it before? - I have. It wasn't my fault. Okay. Let's not argue. Was it paint thinner? I'm not sure. I got it from that pigeon fancier. It was paint thinner, I could smell it. Okay, let's not stand here. Let's go. Haven't you lit fires with paint thinner before? It doesn't stay on walls. You need to mix it with something. - Some powder, oil or something. - What powder? Buy it from the paint shop. I'll give you the address. They mix the powder with water. It won't even smell. Okay. Let's go to takbali's now and come back tomorrow. We'll bring the mix. Faraj... Go buy the powder now. We'll mix it in later. Isn't it better if we come tomorrow? Okay, tomorrow it is. You go to his. I'll get the powder and meet you there. Okay. - Ready? Got a pen and paper? - No. - I'll give you one of my notes. - Don't give him the wrong one. - Here. - Is it a magic trick? This is the message you're going to send. Read it. Memorise it. Then what? Just put it in your pocket. Done? Give that to me. This pocket is empty. I know what you're trying to do. - Is your pocket empty? - They're all empty. You, empty your pockets too. - They say "empty pockets, full heart". - Let me see. It's empty. - Now close your eyes. - Close them! You too! Concentrate. Don't open them! - No peeking? - No. - Now open your eyes. - Thank god. How come? I get scared when my eyes are closed. How cute. Now reach into your pocket. The other one. Amazing! - You are witches! - So you brought cops. I brought a generator. I was arrested. Who arrested you? - They're saying I brought you here. - You did. Didn't you find our trick exciting? - It was! - I'm asking you. I've seen lots of tricks like that. - What's the film you're screening? - The deer. I see. What a choice. - It's not banned. - Right. - Why this film though? - We want to send a message. - To the actor? - No, someone else. Don't tell them everything. I didn't say who. Let's go. That was a very fun trick you played. Really cool! Ladies, you could be my daughters. This morning we were informed a missile has been found near here. Did you know about that? - A missile? - A missile. What missile? This morning? Where? Between your screen and the spring. Behind this hill. - A missile has landed? - Don't worry. We don't know where from. Didn't you feel the ground shake? No, we didn't. We were so busy with the anniversary, we didn't notice the missile. When this film was released, four people set fire to a cinema. One of them was supposed to go in and shout "fire" to make people run away. But he didn't. The doors were locked. Smoke filled the room. Everyone died. What anniversary are you celebrating? It's not just us. People come every year to watch this film here. They are the travellers I told you about. - Would you like some watermelon? - Yes. Could you please teach me the trick? - Can I have some too? - I'll out everyone a slice. - No, I can't teach you. - Why not? What happened to the arsonists? Three of the four died in the fire. The fourth was arrested later. Can you give me a hand, setareh? Thanks. That looks good. Thank you very much. What's so special about this spring? It doesn't reflect any image and magnifies the screen's light. What do you mean? It doesn't reflect anything. That's why it's famous. How is that possible? Have you done something to it? - Us? - Who else? Colonel, come have some watermelon! Captain, don't try, you won't see yourself in it. - Old clover controls its reflection. - Who's that? One of the elders. She's very old. How can she control it? They say she keeps the reflection in a box. Are you students? Yes. That trick was brilliant. Does it work for long distance messages too? - We can manage that too. - Incredible. - Are you a student too? - Yes. The distance doesn't matter. How interesting. Take some watermelon for the colonel, it's getting dark. You said he was a captain. We've got a generator. These two are for the front door. These two for the back. And this one. This is the wrong way around. Our doors open inwards. - All of them? - Yes. I don't know why. They all open inwards. Then put them on the other side. But these are for the back door. For the emergency exit, where I store the drinks. Then mount them on the inside, not on the drinks side. It won't open. Just put them on. Who cares? Put the handles, so that people know where the entrance is. They've forced them outwards and screwed all the hinges. Please don't mix up the locks. I've had trouble putting them in order. Which door do people use to leave in the evening? The entrance is closed, so they use the backdoor. With all the seats they've added, it's a furnace up there. Naderi's ideas... We should leave the front door open. It'll cause trouble. People keep going out and it lights up the screen. The others start swearing and it kicks off. That's for sure. Whatever you do, make sure you lock the front doors. Otherwise, there will be brawls. Anyway, it's up to you. You take care of these. I'm off. Jalal, are you taking these reels away soon? You'll get me in trouble. I'll take them. Do it or get someone else to take them. The whole booth is filled with reels. Okay, I'll take care of it. Takbali... How long have you been clean? Ten days. Is that long or short? You've gained a lot of weight. What are you talking about? He's ten days clean. I asked if that was a long or a short time. It's a long time for me and a short time for you. Really? If you say so... Takbali, do you still see abdollah bagha? No, I don't. Be careful not to take any pills from him. What pills? He's got an iron will. Don't underestimate him. He sends me pamphlets and I distribute them. Would you like some eggs? Where's your iron will? Eat now? I'm hungry. Have you made me some too? I'm the only strong one here. - Can you bring the ashtray? - I'm already seated. Come on! It's too hot. "I'm the only strong one" and you can't get an ashtray? Of course it's hot. So what? I'm hungry too. It's too hard to fast. Have you heard general razmi got a medal of honour? - Razmi? - Yeah. - Because of the incident in ghom? - Yeah, that bastard. He opened fire on so many people, and now he's getting honoured for it. When the time comes, I'll show him. - If you're not eating, go outside. - I'll go soon. You'll see the food and get cravings. Enjoy your food. Don't worry. Did you know when takbali first met him, abdollah was wearing a puppet costume? - Really? - Yeah. The day they met, abdollah was inside a puppet. Is that true? Why a puppet? Didn't you know? Abdollah got him involved with us. I didn't know that. Is he right, takbali? He told me to come meet faraj. Here's faraj. Let's go. Call takbali. I've got both oil and powder. They're busy. I'll come help you. - Didn't he mix it for you? - No. He said we just mix it with water. What a drag! - Can you hand me those empty bottles? - Of course. The taj vs ai-arabi game is on. Don't you want to watch? That game isn't today, it's ten days from now. Yadollah... - Bring me the big bottle too. - Will do. Takbali, I need you here too. Get back to work. Hamid! Why have you left your post? I asked that door to be closed. - It's way too soon, fazli! - Okay, I'll tell them to wait. - Kazem! - Yes? - I'm off now. - Have a good evening. - Goodbye. - Bye. Do we have only one poster stand here? For now. I'll put more up later. - How many tickets have we sold? - 430. - So, where are they? - They're already in the auditorium. Great. It's all in your hands, I'm off. No problem. Take care. They say she's mad. Who says that? The people around here. She claims she communicates with the dead. Her house is here. This one? I'll park the car down there. How has she caught the spring's reflection? - She lies. - What does she say? That she went to swim in the spring with her clothes in a sack. Women go there on their own. When she came out to dry herself, she saw a missile flying above. The missile's reflection flew right into the sack. When she tied the sack shut, the missile vanished from the sky. Interesting. What year was that? Nobody knows. There are different versions. Was it during the war with Iraq or after? No idea. What's this construction site? That's why the ground shook. I've got a signal here. Good. Should I call them? Leave it for later. - Should I come too? - Look at this! No, you stay here. I've got ten missed calls from them. I'll give them a ring. Call them. We'll go up there. People here go to bed early. Hi, how are you? - Did you go to esfehan today? - Yes. Why did you go there? I wanted to go where no-one knows me. I thought it was a better place. The city, you mean? No, the rehab centre. No, they're the same everywhere. They all just give you a bite to eat, then stuff you with fairy liquid. - Who were they? - The guys from the village. - Are you an addict? - Of course not. She's not going to open the door. How do we go in? What can I say? I don't know. - Why did you bring me all this way? - You asked me to. I know how we can get in. Then open it. - You want money? - Of course not. What then? Your belt. It looks so nice. - Take this or I'll slap you. - I thought you'd give me the belt. After you. It always stinks here. It stinks of death. Where is she? Mr old clover? I thought she was a woman. I'm not sure. Sometimes she's a woman, sometimes a man. Her clothes are usually men's. This way. Did you hear her? Can't you hear her? Is she playing music? It's her daughter. She plays songs. Wait here. I'll be back. - That's really strange. - She's lying. - Who? - Their friend. She's not lying. I was right there with her once. Every time Leila goes to the cinema, she finds money. Even a little. And once she found 100 tomans. Never mind the amount. - But it happens every time? - Every single time. - She's being paid by cinema. - What do you mean? I mean cinema. The cinema? The last time I saw a film, I was alone in the cinema. - Maybe it doesn't want Leila there. - Who? Cinema. It's trying to bribe her not to go. Or to come again. - What for? - Seeking out company. Leila? - Is she single? - Who are you talking about? Cinema! I went to see an experimental film and I was the only one. - They screened it? - Yes. - Impossible. - They did. Nonsense. If cinema needed company, it would pay all girls, not just her. Also, they don't screen films for one person. It wants Leila, and they did screen it. Who better than Leila? They need a minimum of three spectators. That's weird. - What, the minimum audience? - No, cinema paying to see Leila. We pay to go see it too. It was scary being there all alone. What if the ticket guy had come in? - You should have covered your neck. - She found money when I was there. - With Leila? - It was 10 tomans. So she gets more cash alone. Why cover my neck? I had my scarf on. At least, he wouldn't have been able to strangle you. He could with her scarf. I'd heard about the minimum audience. That's what scared me. I wondered why they were screening it. - You should buy three tickets. - Why? So that they think two more are coming. - I've read an article by this writer. - This one? - Where? - In the paper. Yes, he's still writing. - It was last year. - He still writes. Let me speak. - Come on, guys! - I'm a girl. - Come on, girl. - Why do you say "guys"? Negar, come on! The article said that he once lost a lighter in a film festival queue. The next year, he found one in the same queue. - The same lighter? - No, just a lighter. It also introduced a director called Harold Shaw. He was born 143 years ago. From the silent era. He made many films and they all featured fire. He died in a fire aged 49. This writer makes up a lot of stuff. He'd written about this boy he met who knew everything. How is that possible? He just makes thing up. He's also written about the deer. Why is that film called the deer? That's a misunderstanding. The real title is the dear. You're joking? It's the deer! Why the deer? Because of the antlers. The more they grow, the harder it gets for the deer to hide. - Is it tusi's analysis? - No, zaven's. Hello! How are you? Good to see you. How's it going? Haven't you gone in yet? - What? - Haven't you gone in yet? - Where's your soulmate? - Have you broken up? - Shut up! - Come on, dump him! - Was there a guard at the gate? - No, why? We heard they might come and stop the screening, she's worried. No, it'll be fine. I'll go in, see you later. The last time I saw a film here, there was still the open-air cinema. Where did they project the film? There. See that hole in the wall? The booth was there. Are we off? Aren't you coming? Just a moment. - You have to pull the rope first. - What rope? Didn't I mention the rope? - Give me a break... - She shut the door. If you could just get in, lots of people would come for the box. Pull the rope first, and if you get it right, old clover will let you in. Hey, boss! Trust me, okay? Come here for a second. This way. This is the rope. Where's the other end? Is it tied to the tree? To the sky, can't you see? Come on! Now stand here. Hold this tight. Give me your hand. Hold it here. Think of something, concentrate on it, then pull the rope. The thing will fall from the sky. If it lands in your palm, old clover will see you. Concentrate. - Are you screwing with me? - Of course not. Close your eyes. Now concentrate. A little bit to this side. Close your eyes, boss. Concentrate. If you pull it right, you'll see old clover. Concentrate. Be quiet so that I can concentrate. I'll shut up. Now pull! It didn't work. - So what? - Let's go back to the spring. You are screwing with me! I've come all this way to pull a rope? Please, boss, wait! You were too impatient. You should have waited longer. Put some lime on them. Did you go to esfehan today? Yeah. Why there? I wanted to go where no-one knows me. I thought it was a better place. The city, you mean? No, the rehab centre. I thought it was better. They're the same everywhere. They all just give you a bite to eat, then stuff you with fairy liquid. Go ahead, I'll bring these. An anthology of wisdom? I had to get off at an earlier station for this. Did you buy it in esfehan? Yes. Where from? I don't know, some multi-storey shopping centre. Just this one? No, this is... One of them. I bought eight books. What books? What else? Well, I'm not sure. The station was full of policemen, so I had to leave them on the bus. I only took this one. I heard about that police raid. Is that faraj? Yeah. Hello. How are you, faraj? Hi, fallah. - Good to see you. - You too. - Have you eaten? - We had a snack. I'm not eating until late evening. It is late evening! Let's take care of our business first. What are these? The bottles we filled up at your place. They look the same as last time. I've put the powder in them. It's going to go off like fireworks. - You've tested it? - Yes, it burns well. How do you know the paint shop guy? He knows his stuff. I used to be a painter. Pardon? I didn't hear you. - I used to be a construction painter. - Speak louder. Guys, we have to start that fire tonight no matter what. Got it? - Tomorrow will be easier. - No. It has to be tonight. I can't wait anymore. He can't let it go. I've been trying to talk him out of it. But he's brought all these bottles here. - We have to plant them there. - Who knows what might happen tomorrow! Why bother? We'll push a couple each up our trousers legs and stuff the other one in here, like this. Pure and simple. Out of sight. What's that? Takbali's book. "I shall just narrate and let you judge for yourself." What is this? An anthology of wisdom. Let me see. What the hell is this? Are you trying to get arrested? Just for a book? Okay, finish up, we need to go. Let's get this over with. Where do we do it? - Let's do cinema soheila. - Soheila? - Where? - Soheila. Let's go. Pack it up, guys. Be careful. Mr naderi! What should I do with these? No idea. Why don't you give them to Mina? Hamid! - Mina? - My niece. She's in my office. Give them to her, to the reception, or put them up. There's loads of space! Just wanted to let you know. I'm off to the screening. Okay. Go and I'll send someone to take these. - Where did you unload these? - At the backdoor. Make sure they're not blocking the door, in case inspectors show up. - There isn't enough space. - Do your work. - It's the emergency exit. - And you, mind you own business. Why have you left your post? I asked that door to be closed. It's way too soon, fazli! Okay, I'll tell them to wait. Why are they closed so early? Maybe the operation has been revealed? Who'd reveal it? Even we didn't know we were doing it here! Fallah... - Let's do it right here. - Here? In plain sight? Let's go in through the back alley. - Is there a way in? - Yes, around the back. Follow me. Which one is the door to the cinema? One's here and one's over there on the left. - Thanks. - No problem. The shah is going down. If the army had intervened, he'd be out by now. Even without the army, he's going down. You'll see. There's nothing to burn on this side! There's a window. He wants us to set fire to a measly window! You are into windows, right? We'll just douse the window. Why did you say he's into windows? They went to burn the pro-shah party headquarters. Just burned a couple of windows! Let's go. This guy's too soft for this kind ofjob. If it was up to me, I'd take guns. Stop messing with us. Let's go! Shall I tell you what happened the other day? - What? - We were on the bike. We saw a couple of those decadent girls in short skirts. I said to takbali: "Shall we get the razors out, teach them a lesson?" But he got upset! Don't be so sensitive, takbali, it's just a razor! One slash and it's over! Why a razor? Forget about the razor. I say let's go burn down general razmi's house. Takbali, your friends are here! You're out of it! Let's go. - Is she in the loo? - What did you think of the film? - Nothing. - Nothing? - Come on! - Really, I have no opinions about it. That's impossible. Okay. Shaw's film is sixty years old. It's about... I've seen it. Good for you. Is there any film you haven't seen? Well I've seen this one. If he says so, he has. - Really? - Yeah! Okay. I bet you the emergency exit here is locked. So what? So maybe that guy knows something. - Which guy? - The writer. - I'm in. - Good. - What do you bet? - Whatever. - Don't tempt me! - Or what? I'll say something embarrassing! I'll bet too. Whatever you want! - What's your problem with him? - With who? - The writer. - He makes stuff up. Here's the deal. I'll team up with him. If we lose, we'll share the loss. No way. You team up, but if you lose, you'll have to pay double. You're too kind. I really had to leave. It was urgent. He's claiming he's seen that film. Right, he's seen every single film! Captain! Boss! What's in this? It's yours now. Here's the key. - I need to talk to her. - Sorry, she won't. I can't help it. Insist. You've got the box and the key. Old clover said you should open it tomorrow. And call your daughter tonight. How do you know about my daughter? It's not my fault you dropped the mirror. How would I know your daughter? Captain? Mohsen? Hold please, I've found him! - Talk to them yourself. - Hold this. - What's this? - Nothing. Talk to him. Please don't make me stay the night here! Why are you so scared of it? This is so heavy, you're burly! - Here. - What happened? They got cut off. Damn this phone. The signal's failed. What did they say? He said they'll be here tomorrow. And he mentioned the wartime bomb. That's it. He asked us where we were. Didn't you tell them? They might go somewhere else. They said help will arrive tomorrow. Let's see. - We'll stay here. - What? Where? Over there by the spring. With the girls. It's not like we'll be in their tent. We'll take a few blankets. With this idiot? What about the driver? I'll send them elsewhere. But they'll spend the night sending messages to our pockets! - Give that to me. - They won't call. I need it for myself. There's no water in the toilet. Don't touch that! Has the film started? - You have a ticket? - Yes. - Where did you get it? - At the front door. Hurry up. The door on the left. Guys, let's go. Can I leave these here? Mr naderi will send someone to get them. - What are they for? - Careless crime. - That's already playing. - We got them late. I'm seeing it now. Do you know ghorban ostanpalangi? - No, who's that? - Some bum who sleeps here. I see. Look around, see if he's here. If I go, he'll run off. Then, I'll take your posters. Okay. Hey, are you ghorban? - Can I help you? - The security guy's after you. Thanks. - Have you got a smoke? - No, sorry. - You're still here! - Don't lecture me. - Did he invite you to his? - He stood me up. Men are bastards. - How about the Mercedes guy? - He didn't even notice. Get in, I've been waiting... For me? I'm going to watch the film. Let's drive and bitch about the guy. We'll have fun! You're nuts. Let's make up. Let's go have a water fight. Shared genes, shared vices! Wait. - He's not here. - You didn't look well. I know him. He's not here. Give them to me. I'm leaving though. As long as I'm not holding them... Thanks. What a pain! Even standing tickets are sold out. - Behrouz is a star. People love him. - He's not in the film. Of course he is. It's just a cameo! Still. He's popular. You should have seen him in gheysar. I saw gheysar in cinema soheila. You weren't even born then! I saw it there. Ask anyone you like. Okay. Remember how busy it was? People came because it's political. - Political? - It is. The character with the moustache is a leftist. A leftist? It wouldn't get a screening permit if it was political. Then why do we get so many threats? It's because of that. - How's it going, ostanpalangi? - Thanks. Can I bum a smoke off you? I'm going cold Turkey. Do you want hundreds of them to get high? The threat wasn't about that. That's what jalal said. You're talking about behrouz film? I made up the threats. I hoped they might not screen it. - See? He says it's behrouz film. - It is. Everyone says it's behrouz's. Are you crazy? You really made that up? I don't want the crowd here. Do you enjoy overwork? The report says thirty cinemas so far. Thirty cinemas? Let's say fifty instead. Fifty cinemas burned down. Okay. How can you fact-check that? Why check? These guys don't lie. I'm not saying they're lying. But you can't have an exact count. Of course you can. I counted them. It was in the paper. A survey showed there were thirty. See what he's saying? - They did a survey. - Yes. You're saying they didn't? Go read the papers. A survey is just counting. Who did the counting? I did. Why would I lie? There have been reports of thirty cinema fires this year. - Thirty? - At least! Let's say twenty, ten. Whatever. All I'm saying is they shouldn't make such a big deal out of it. It is a big deal. It's very newsworthy. They have to cover it. Guys, let's go! You believe everything they write in the papers? They've investigated. Let's go. I can't talk sense into you. - Where did you find this? - In broom spring. - Where's that? - Near the old factory, up broom hill. Everything is broom there. It's the name of the area. Why do you have a heater? I'm taking it to the pool. Here. It's a good heater. It's made in Japan. You can't buy one like this nowadays. Wait here while I figure things out. - I've got us tickets for here. - Here? - But it's so busy here! - Even better. Someone might get hurt. Are you serious? As soon as it starts, people will just rush out. You just have to shout "smoke! Fire!" That's it. People will just run out. - When do I do that? - I'll tell you when. Let's go. Guys... If tonight doesn't work out, I'm going to burn down general razmi's house. Now he's all fired up! Let's go this way. It's closer. We'll go faster through the back street. I know the way. Come on. - You know the way? - Yes, it's much quicker. I've been here before. - Have you? - Yes. What time is it? Seven. Why don't you have a watch? I don't like it. Come on. Why don't you teach people the trick for money? Sure, we could charge. It can't be just bought. It needs skill, talent, motivation... How did you learn it? - She taught it to me. - I already knew it. We're nomads. If we learn even one thing per stop, we end up with lots of wisdom. - Do you want to learn it? - I do! - What should I do? - Look over there. In the deer, the guy's sister was called Maryam. I'm certain. Who's naimeh then? Do you think he might know? Do you remember the sister's name in the deer? - Maryam. The one with the plaits. - Right. Take this tea. That one's gone cold. Thanks. - Thanks for your help. - You're welcome. - Here's some tea for you. - Thank you. Do you think the light will reach the screen? No idea. I'm an electrician. - Where can I get a signal? - Up by the spring. Okay. I'll go up there and see. If there's a signal, I'll come get you. Okay? What was in the box? What's it got to do with you? Mind your own business. And stop hanging around with these girls. - Go away. - Yes, sir. Do you remember the sister's name in the deer? - Maryam. The one with the plaits. - Right. Take this tea. That one's gone cold. Thanks. - Thank you. - I'll do my best. Do you remember the name of ghodrat's girlfriend? - What happened? All good? - Yes, everything's okay. Here you are. - What about yourself? - There's more. Then you'll go to naimeh? Who's naimeh? Never mind. I thought you were a film buff. Sahar? Majid! Come here. - Do you know who naimeh was? - No. What did you want? Is your sister mad at me? - She's not my sister. - She looks like she is. Shall we go? I'll go myself. There must be a signal up there. Then why did you call me over? Who's that guy? The electrician. Hey! - Where I can get a signal? - Up by the spring. Okay then. I'll go up there and see. If there's a signal, I'll come get you. Okay. What was in the box? What's it got to do with you? Mind your own business. And stop hanging around with these girls. - Go away. - Yes, sir. Do you remember the sister's name in the deer? - Maryam. The one with the plaits. - Right. Take this tea. That one's gone cold. - When do you need it? - Tonight if you can. I'll do my best. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Do you remember the name of ghodrat's girlfriend? What happened? - All good? - Yes, everything's okay. Here you are. - What about yourself? - There's more. Then you'll go to naimeh? Who's naimeh? Never mind. I thought you were a film buff. Sahar? Majid! Come here. - Do you know who naimeh was? - No. - What did you want? - Is your sister mad at me? - She's not my sister. - She looks like she is. Speaking of sisters, do you know what ghodrat's sister was called? Everyone knows that. Maryam. Maryam. Thanks. In the deer, the guy's sister was called Maryam. I'm certain. Who's naimeh then? Do you think he might know? - I didn't get any of that. - Nothing at all? Who was this naimeh? Let's go through it once more. Look over there again, you'll get it. It's fixed. - All fixed? - Yes. - Don't you screw with us again. - Of course not. - Is there petrol? - Yes. Right to the top. I'm not alone here. I can tell. - Who is she? - Her name is fati. She used to love me. She's decided to stay with me. She's fallen out of love with me. But she's sticking to her guns. She thinks that leaving me would be a betrayal. She still thinks I'm a hero. She's an actress. She also sings. Her stage name is naimeh. Here, wear this. It's clean. Fati will take care of your wound when she's back home. I'm off to pick her up. I'll be back by the time you serve tea. - It's a good name for a cinema. - Sounds like my watch. - That's rolex. - They've all gone in. - Is this the last screening? - Yes. - How do we get in? - The main door. Has the film started? - You have a ticket? - Yes. - Where did you get it? - At the front door. Hurry up. The door on the left. Guys, let's go. It's seven, we're not late. - Is mr fain gone? - Yes, he went home. But he knows your hideout. But I clear it every morning. Ramezani will go mad if he finds out. He won't, if you don't act suspiciously. He suspects you're sleeping there. Stay away. Did you sort out the door handles? Tomorrow. I was too busy. Please, clear up your camp better. I do that all the time! I'm off. - Let's go have falafel. - I've got a long way to go. Here, take the padlocks. And the keys. I'll go grab a bite. I'll pop in and lock up, then I'll come with you for dinner. Am I supposed to give you bed and full board? - It's just falafel, not pizza! - No way. I'm going home. Go clean up your hideout before I get sacked. - I will. - Be careful with the locks. You'd left the front door open last night. I locked it. Maybe the wind blew it open. Don't let kazem know I've given you keys. Of course. But please wait for me. - I need to go. - I'll be back in a sec. Don't go, okay? Hey, I'm locking up here. And the cafe is shut. Use the other entrance. There. What a bastard. Where are we sitting? You're in row five and I'm in four. - Why not in the same row? - I don't know. It doesn't matter. - This is my row. - Ours is here. His name brings excitement. His name brings artistic excellence. His name is behrouz vossoughi. Behrouz vossoughi in... It's the deer! I've seen this! People like you fill these places of decadence. I've seen it too. But I like his other films more. Here's another one. This isn't porn. They're serious films. Oh really? I thought it was porn! One of them is a left-wing activist. What did he say? One of them is supposed to be a leftist. Which one? The one opposite behrouz. The moustache. If he's a leftist activist, he's full of crap. Do you want to leave then? Let's go. I'll be right back. Where are you going? Toilet. I'll be back. Excuse me. You've changed something. What is it? - Does it look good? - Let me see. - The film... - Hasn't started yet. Okay then. This guy next to me is touching me with his thigh. He's old. That makes it worse. Don't say anything to him. If I want to say something, I don't need you to do it. Why don't you? Because... Didn't you say he was old? Doesn't it bother you? - The guy? - Yes. You said I shouldn't say anything. Yes, but I changed my mind. He was touching me with his thigh. Look at him. Why should I do that now? I got scared. I felt it was me, but older. - Rubbish! - Seriously, look at him. He looks exactly like me, forty years older! When did you wake up? Just now. Sir? Last night I wrote a letter. I thought I'd tell you: I'll try to get the girl to send it for me. What do you mean? The thing they did with the pocket. Yesterday. Who is it for? Leila. Are you still not over her? It's a short one. Whatever. What was in the box? Nothing. You really thought there would be something? I had my doubts yesterday. So I went back to the rope. I had a look. You know how clever I am. I got my phone out. I turned the torch on. It was attached to a ring, not to the sky. I followed the rope. It was tied to a bungee cord. It was a fake. I found a sack in the box. I thought a missile would fly out of it and cruise straight over the water, on and on, and it would slip all the way back into place. They've screwed with us so well. What a bunch of idiots we are. Let's get going. Good morning. Did you sleep well? In the deer, the guy's sister was called Maryam. I'm certain. Who's naimeh then? Do you think he might know? Fallah! Come here. - I didn't get any of that. - Nothing at all? Who was this naimeh? Let's go through it once more. Look over there again, you'll get it. It's fixed. - All fixed? - Yes. - Don't you screw with us again. - Of course not. - Is there petrol? - Yes. Right to the top. I'm not alone here. I can tell. - Who is she? - Her name is fati. She used to love me. She's decided to stay with me. She's fallen out of love with me. But she's sticking to her guns. She thinks that leaving me would be a betrayal. She still thinks I'm a hero. She's an actress. She also sings. Her stage name is naimeh. Here, wear this. It's clean. Fati will take care of your wound when she's back home. I'm off to pick her up. I'll be back by the time you serve tea. Honestly, ghodrat. This woman is my rock. Wear this. We need to stop the bleeding. Fati will take care of you. Did you graduate from high school? No, it's a shame. I couldn't. I left home. How's your mother? Does she still get annoyed by the sound of the dice when you play backgammon? It's nice of you to remember that. What a memory! Five years ago... She passed away. Takbali, you and I will douse this side. You two do the other side. Why are you standing there? Go upstairs! Another bottle. Hurry up. Yadollah and I will do this side. You two go do downstairs. Takbali, right after you light it, run in there and shout "fire! Fire!" Don't let the smoke blow in. We'll go back to our seats. As soon as you shout fire, we'll get up and follow you out. Be careful. Hey, I'm locking up here. And the cafe is shut. Use the other entrance. Adaptation: Massoumeh lahidji subtitling titrafilm
