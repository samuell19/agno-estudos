What was that? Don't you worry about that, just worry about this. No... no, Tommy, not here. You gotta be jacking me. I was jacking you before, and now I'm just telling you something. You are so beautiful. I said not here. I didn't say not there. Oh, Tommy! The girls in home-room were right. What do you want?! What do you want?! Hello, do you have an appointment? Mr. Paul Johnson, 10 o'clock. - Blood test. - No test. - I beg your pardon. - No test. Transfusion. Don't tell me a big man like you is afraid of a little needle. I have no fear. I came for a transfusion of blood. Well, Mr. Johnson, I'm really sorry, but you're gonna have to take the test. We don't just pass out blood like it's gasoline, you know. First we have to find out if you need regular or unleaded. Okay, why don't you have a seat. Doctor'll be with you in a moment. Some magazines there you can look at. Paging Dr. Miller. Paging Dr. Arnold Miller. Dr. Rochelle, this is Mr. Johnson, he'd like an immediate transfusion. Determination is an admirable quality, Mr. Johnson. Nadine, would you take him to the lab and run his type? No, no, he's having a fast pint on the fly, no tests. Would you please come inside, Mr. Johnson? Now, Mr. Johnson... why don't you want a blood test? I choose not to reveal a reason. I see. Well then, I suggest you try another doctor. You have no blood here? Yes, we have blood. There's not a doctor on Earth who'll transfuse... blood without first learning the patient's type... Rh factor, and other peculiarities. The wrong kind would probably kill you. I must have blood. I am dying. I am... type "O". I'm sorry, but I can't take your word for any of those facts. Get away from there! Observe. No bleeding. It will bleed... in some moments, but then thinly and sporadically. - Have you been to another doctor? - None that you know of. Hematologists, blood doctors? Will you give me the transfusion? Not unless you submit to a test. Then, without a specimen of my blood for study... it is impossible? Impossible. You will test. You will take of my blood and scrutinize it. Then you will know, and you will prescribe. You may study it in all the ways of your kind... and you may learn, but you may not speak. You will not, you can not transmit to any other being your knowledge of my tragedy. I'm sorry, I... seem to have developed a... terrible headache, all of a sudden. I am ready for your test now. Oh, I'm glad you changed your mind. Take off your coat. This won't hurt. Now just let's hope we can get some. Fantastic. Agglutinin disintegrating at an uninterrupted rate... resulting in the destruction of the cellular structure of blood. Impossible. There, that should do it. You assist the doctor in preserving life? Well, that isn't exactly what it says on my diploma... but it sort of captures the flavor of things. How much money do you receive for performing these duties? That's a rather personal question, isn't it? - I have said something wrong? - No, not really. I'm just not used to talking finance with patients. I wish to employ you. Would $1000 a week be sufficient? It depends on what you have in mind. Preserving my health. Seeing to it that I do not expire. Mr. Johnson, no one in this world can guarantee life. Nor in any other, I fear. Dr. Rochelle will prescribe daily blood transfusions for me. Since I can not administer them myself, I will require someone with your skills. Would 2000 dollars be adequate? More than adequate. This whole thing has the sound of something very unethical. Besides, I like working with the doctor, we're kind of a team, you know. Like Laurel and Hardy. I am unaware of these doctors. Would it still be unethical if Dr. Rochelle asked you to serve me? If the doctor assigned me to your case, I'd take it of course. I see. And you're to administer 500 CC's of type "O" every night until further orders from me. Yes, doctor, exactly what is wrong with him? Well, it's very interesting, he has a... I can't be precise. There's evidence of some internal hemorrhage. I see. When do you want me to move into his house? Immediately. Today. Then I'm gonna have to go home first and get my toothbrush. Well, pack your clothing. This may very well be a protracted stay. Oh... How long does he have? I, ah... I don't know. I'm doing all I can. From this point on... it's in the hands of God. I see. Hey, is this your vehicle, pal? Does that fact seem in dispute? I gotta hand it to you, buddy, I've never seen anybody commit so many violations at once. I'm gonna need extra paper just to write this thing up. He is aggressive, why? Get in the car, Mr. Johnson, I'll talk to him. Harry, don't you ever quit? You come here, I'm expecting a nice pleasant little lunch... and you kick things off by hassling my patient, nice going! Okay, okay, lighten up. Call it my police instinct if you will... but Nadine, come on, the guys in the red zone, no parking sign... you got your fire hydrant... and he's on the wrong side of the street for God's sake. I think this bozo's earned himself a ticket. But you don't understand... he came here for an emergency transfusion... he was in critical condition when he arrived. Besides, I'm taking care of him now, and I'll make sure he gets home safely. You know you're taking advantage of my soft spot for nurses? You bet I am. Where're we going for lunch? I don't suppose you'd settle fro a burger and a shake? Oh, I have a choice? Oh yeah, you could start an extended hunger strike. Come on, you know my tastes by now, its lobster and Chardonnay, all the way. Hmm, tell me about it. Listen, what do you say we do that Chardonnay and lobster thing Friday night? I only have Thursdays off. Exactly what I said, love Thursdays. I'll think about it. Do that. I will. All right buddy, I'm gonna let you off with a warning this time. A warning about what? Funny guy, very funny. Thank you, officer. I'll see you later, Mr. Johnson! And be a little more careful, bud. Hey boss... how many times I gotta tell you not to take the car 'til you know to drive. Come into the house, Jeremy. We will have a guest arriving tonight, prepare a room. Next to yours? Miss Nadine Storey will be administering to my medical needs. Make sure she has all the necessary comforts, understand? Loud and clear, boss. I will be in the cellar. I am not to be disturbed. Okey-doke. I do not pay you to spy on me, Jeremy. Should do so again, I shall eliminate you. Just thought you needed some help, boss. When I require assistance... I shall call on you. Now, go... prepare the nurse's room. Sure, anything you say, boss. Would you like me to make diner for you tonight? That will not be necessary. I will be dining... out. Hello? Linda... hi. Naw, nothing, I just got kind of startled. I'm hearing some noises. Hey, I'm ready, when you coming over? All right, see ya. Bye-bye. How ya doing, baby? Nice to see some new talent around here. Do you work for Mr. Johnson? Sure do, name's Jeremy, bodyguard, chauffeur, chief cook and bottle washer. - I'm loaded with talents. - I bet you are. Do you also have a permit for the gun parked under your jacket? You have an eye for detail, I like that in a... lady. Seems to me we're gonna get along just fine. Don't count on it. Where's Mr. Johnson? Entrez. Woof. Yo, boss, we got company. Hello, Mr. Johnson. It is good that you are here. I'm sorry I couldn't come earlier, but I had to clean out my desk at the clinic. Do not excuse yourself for imagined wrongs, Miss Storey. Come, I shall show you to your room. Thank you, I'm just dying to see it. You are not dying, I am dying. This is such a beautiful place you have here. It is adequate. Jeremy and I are alone here. You are the only person other than ourselves who has been in this house. Yeah, we've only been here a month. Enough discussion, Jeremy. It is time that you make certain all of the exterior entrances are secure. Then go to Miss Storey's car... carry her bags and supplies to her room. Right boss, I'll take them up to the honeymoon suite. You're so kind, Jeremy. Your quarters are upstairs, Miss Storey. Here you shall sleep. I have received blood this day. Therefore you have no duties until tomorrow. Then I'll say goodnight, Mr. Johnson. Mr. Johnson! Mr. Johnson! Yes, Miss Storey. - You locked my door. - I did. - Why? - You did not wish it? If my door's gonna be locked, I'd like to do my own locking. In the place where I am from... no person would dare sleep in insecure quarters. Just where do you come from? I believe your expression was... goodnight... was it not, Miss Storey? Yes. Goodnight, sir. Time narrows. There is death upon Davanna. Davanna must endure. Speak of the Earth creatures. They are second stage sub-human. Weak, and full of fright. They are optically primitive, and must converse by oral sound. Speak of their blood. It may be as ours. I've sent to you thirty cubits for study. That must be more. Now the wars of Davanna are ended. The conquered enemies dwindle in the pens of pasture, and time constricts. It is soon that we shall all perish. Perhaps the blood of this planet shall answer. It is rich, clean... and rushes even now through the veins of my body. Then there is hope. The council has sent instructions. I shall receive them. Your mission upon this globe... is to be accomplished in 5 phases. In the first you will study all... characteristics of the Earth sub-humans. Phase 1 is study. In the second, you shall increase the quantity of... Earth blood, which you are transmitting to Davanna. Phase 2 is more Earth blood. For phase 3, we must have a live specimen. A sub-human to be used in vivisectory research. Phase 3 is a live specimen. You are phase 4... in which Earth blood value... will be determined by your survival or your death. Phase 4 is my life or death. If the Earth blood preserves your life... phase 5 will be the conquest... subjugation, and pasturing of the Earth sub-humans. Upon your order. Phase 5 is conquest... subjugation and pasturing, if I live. I am returning. Yo, boss, got your breakfast. Sure hope you eat something this morning. I'm starting to think you don't like my cooking. When you have brought food to Miss Storey, I have an errand for you. Return these to the public library. Here is the name of an additional volume I wish to study. You read all this last night? Hell, it takes me 2 weeks just to get through the Inquire. I require very little sleep. Yeah, I guess so. - Anything else, boss man? - Nothing. Okey-doke. Hello! Room service. Got your breakfast. - Is that you, Jeremy? - Every inch of me... bigger than life, and twice as beautiful, baby. Spare me the details and just leave the tray on the coffee table. Anything for you, doll. After a stretch here, I should be ready for a job at the Ritz. At least there you get a tip. Why, doesn't Johnson pay you much? He pays me too much! I think the guy's short a few nuts and bolts. Would it be out of line for me to ask how much he gives you? Nothing you could do would be out of line, baby. He pays me two thou a week, in gold no less. Gold! Yeah, he has a stash of it locked away somewhere. Once a week he gives me a couple of bars and I... take 'em down an exchange 'em for some cash. And what do you do to earn your keep, 'sides hassle nurses? Most anything. Such as? Such as... fixing meals that Johnson never eats... and such as... makin' sure nobody goes down in the cellar. Why, what's down there? I don't know, nobody ever includes me. - So what do you do, hon? - I'm the health blood pumper. So what time does the health blood pumper get off of work? If it's all the same to you Jeremy, I think I'll get my charges somewhere else. Now why don't you just run along like a good little boy while I get dressed. Whatever you say, babe. Oh, and ah... by the way... that's a great looking mole you have on your left cheek. Mr. Johnson, you strike me as a very healthy man. I am pleased... perhaps your treatments will prevent my predicted death. For someone who thinks he's dying... you sure are all mighty casual about it. How can one not be casual? Death is not a remarkable thing. No, but it's not exactly something someone looks... forward to with giddy anticipation, either. Nor with undue dread. I will not need you again 'til this evening. So you may do as you wish until then. All right, I think I'll try out that beautiful pool of yours. Going swimming? Your powers of deduction amaze me, Jeremy. Hey, I hope you didn't get the wrong idea about me this morning. No, you know, I think I got the right one. I bet you were the kind of kid that used to look up little girls dresses. That's a hard habit to kick, baby. Actually, when you get to know me better, I'm really a sweetheart of a guy. I bet Attila the Hun thought the same way. You swim like a mermaid. You never know, maybe I am one. I've got a hook and line inside, maybe I should go get it. I'm afraid you just haven't got the right bait, Jeremy. Shouldn't say things like that until you see the size of my fishing pole. You better be careful, you just might land a barracuda. Good morning. I represent the Airways Vacuum Cleaner Company. - Are you the gentleman of the house? - This is my house. Crazy. I'd like to show you the product. You wish that I purchase your machine? Oh, no, I don't want ya to purchase anything, mister. I just wanna give you a free demonstration. You wanna purchase, you purchase. You don't wanna purchase, you don't have to purchase. I ain't gonna force you to purchase. Now, this is one of our standard attachments. This'll clean anything you got in the house. From the deepest pile carpet, to the most delicate fabric. - Ain't that something? - I do not wish to purchase. Well, let me finish a minute, will ya pal? This, as they say in the vernacular... is the darling of the vacuum cleaning world. If you got any stopped up pipes or drains... whether it's in your kitchen, down in your cellar... this little baby will make all your problems go away. You just take it and stick it right in... No persistence! Leave my house. Sheesh, give me a chance, buddy... it's only a demonstration. Let me show you what this little baby can do in your cellar, and you'll turn flip-flops. No flip-flops. No flip-flops. Look, buddy, let me have 5 minutes of your time in your own cellar, and I'll... - prove to you that this little baby... - My cellar? That's right, 5 minutes. Come right in, young man. I should be glad to see your machine in operation. Crazy. Now, will you take a look at the dirt in that drainpipe, buddy. Ain't that a shame? You never know when something like that's gonna give you a lot of trouble. But I'll have it outta there in a jiffy. It's a very simple operation. Hey, save me some water for when I get back from town. All right, I'll do that. I'll bet. Woof. Did you read about them blood fiend? Sucked the people dry, took all their blood out. They better watch out... cause I've got Duke! And Duke'll protect me. You'll get 'em, won't you Duke? Yeah, he'll get 'em all. Tell you what... I've a connection to the spirit world! Heya, doc! They told me at the clinic I might find you here, but hey if you're busy, I... Oh, heh heh, no, ya, I'm... I'm afraid that car of mine has a chronic illness. - So, what's up? - Nadine says you might need a lift.. - You've got yourself quite a girl there you know. - Tell me about it. So come on, hop in. Wait! I've got Elvis! I got Elvis! So doc, did you get her number? Just kidding. Wait! What a beautiful song, Elvis. That was Mr. Moderation with... the #1 song in the southland... where the thermometer is expected to get a high... of 95 degrees downtown... and near a hundred in the valleys. More music after this... The girls of the big doll house are busting out again... New World Pictures... Well, looks like you're enjoying your job. It certainly has its fringe benefits. I can see that. I see Dirty Harry found you all right, doc. Hey, clear the road! Jeremy Perrin? Oh, shit. You gotta be kidding. You mean he works here? You two classmates? Yeah-yeah, Jeremy here usually spends his summers at the Grey Bar Hotel. You got nothing on me Sherlock, I'm straight. What's your angle here, pal? Strictly legit. Tell him, Nadine. Jeremy really does work for Mr. Johnson. Speaking of Mr. Johnson, I came by to pay a call on him. Oh, I wasn't aware that doctor still made house calls. Yeah, I wasn't aware that cheap hoods knew how to read. C'mon guys, Mr. Johnson's resting in the study. - Is Jeremy really a criminal? - Yeah, small time. - Maybe he's trying to reform. - No way. You can't believe that Jeremy would want better himself, is that it? Oh, sure... but then I also donated to Jim & Tammy Baker. Thank you Jeremy, you may go. [?] I assume you have further scrutinized my blood. I certainly have, Mr. Johnson. There's several hundred questions I'd like to ask you. That desire was predictable. How many answers you will receive is not predictable. - Have you spoken of this to anyone? - No, I... I feel it's best to keep it an absolute secret. An excellent feeling. What can you tell me that I do not know? I can tell you this... your blood is unlike any I've studied my entire career. - In what way? - In the first place... no man on Earth should be able to live with... as low a count of red corpuscles as you have. You're not surprised? No. Second place. Your blood is behaving in an impossible manner. The agglutinin is breaking down... destroying the basic structure of the blood itself. - The result... - is evaporating blood. Well, that's an over-simplification. Blood within the veins couldn't possibly evaporate. The more precise term... Evaporation, as a term... will suffice. Can you name a cause? Not yet. But you think you may? I may. I'm already neglecting other work to devote time to this problem. We're already facing AIDS. God forbid another dreadful new plague should strike the earth. Yes. God forbid. You already seem aware of what your problem is. I am aware. If a cure is not soon forthcoming... all of the blood of my body will become dust. And I will die. As a doctor it's my job to try to cheer up the patient. That is an infantile attitude, doctor. Continue with your studies. And come again to see me... when you have learned more. Perhaps I shall learn something soon. I feel that... time is a great element in this case. Time is indeed... the only element. Hiya, boss. Come along, Jeremy. [?] Hey, boss, that cop's filling Nadine with a bunch of lies about me. Jeremy, Dr. Rochelle and his friend are leaving. Good, not a moment too soon. After they depart, prepare the automobile. I want you to take me out tonight. No kidding, you mean we're gonna go out for some laughs, boss? I must return to the study now. Make sure no one comes in there. You got it, boss man. Till later, doctor. Goodbye, Mr. Johnson. Okay, then I'll pick you up at seven. All right, but I've gotta be back early... so you better not try anything. Me? Doc's waiting for you out in the car... Officer Sherbourne. You know, Nadine, I not so sure I like the idea of you and this... punk staying under the same roof. Don't worry, it's a big roof. Besides, me and Nadine are becoming real close friends. Oh, yeah. Well, I'm gonna keep a real close eye on this place from now on, pal. You slip up once, you better grab yourself a shovel. Oh yeah, why so, flatfoot? Because, you'll be in real... deep... shit. - I'll you see tonight. - Okay. Nice hat. Ta-ta. Come back anytime, me and Nadine always love company. God, I hate cops that do Clint Eastwood impressions. I'm telling you, he's the wrong guy to fool with. [?], sweetheart? Well, for one thing, he's got a license for his gun. All right... so I did a little time in the slammer... but that's all in the past. I'm not so sure. You didn't swipe my sunglasses, did ya? I can't find them anywhere. Hell, I dunno. Maybe Johnson took 'em for his private collection. Maybe. Hey, baby. Nice car. Hey! Get away from the car! Jeremy! I have ordered you not to sound the warning horn. Or make any other high decibel noises near me. Yeah, I'm sorry, boss, I forgot. Why are those women behaving in that manner? They're not women, boss, they're hookers. Hookers? Hookers, you know, call girls, prostitutes, juicy Lucy's. They're out drumming up some business. Must be a slow night. What do these hookers do? Just about anything you want 'em to do, boss... as long as you got the cash to pay for it. Phase 2. What was that? Will they come back to the house with us? Sure, they deliver, just like pizza man. I want all 3 of them returning with us tonight. Hell, anything you say, boss. Hiya, toots... Mr. Johnsons's looking for a little company tonight. Tell Mr. Johnson he's come to the right corner. Yeah, right corner! How's about you and your 2 friends coming over to our place tonight? Party, huh? Sure, but what's in it for us? Yeah, what's in it for us? A history lesson, baby. But what's the jive? Yeah, what's the jive? Huh-huh-huh? No jive, we're gonna study some popular American presidents. All right, party time! Yeah! Ooh, nice shades. Neat. Whoa, and away we go! Ooh... swell joint. You must be pretty well healed. I survive. Look, honey... I survive... this... is living. That will be all, Jeremy. You may retire to your room for the night. You know, boss... how about a little something for the effort here? I mean I figured we could... No defiance! That is an order. - But boss... - No defiance! Night-night, Jeremy. Sweet dreams. So, where's the party? No party. Oh, I get it... think you can take on all three of us... stud? I have something I want to show you. I bet you do. Below... in the cellar. Kinky. Got your own playroom? Follow me. Please. Yeah, follow him... please. Neat. I can't say much for the decor. Yeah, decor. It suits my purposes. Umm, maybe we'd be more comfortable in the bedroom. This place is awful damp. Please. This will only take a moment. I'm sure it will. Neat. Do you want us to strip? Do as you please. You're paying top dollar, baby. You might a well get the full show. C'mon. Yeah, sugar... and while you're at it... why don't you take off them glasses. You wouldn't wanna miss any of this. I will take them off... now. Somehow it always gets better. You know me, I practice a lot on my own. I feel sorry for that lady next door though... with all that screaming you were doing, she's liable to report a murder. Murder, you want murder... - Take it easy. - I'll give you murder. Take it easy there, young lady... assaulting an officer gets you six months in solitary. Whatever made you decide to become a cop? I don't know, I guess I watched too many episodes of Chips. Could've been worse, you could've been watching the Twilight Zone. Speaking of a different dimension, how is laughing boy these days? You know, I really know nothing about him... except his condition. - And that... - And what? He's working on something in the cellar. Jeremy! Jeremy! I need you in the cellar! You know I like a copper whose pistol's always fully loaded. Oh, very funny. Stop. Johnson and Jeremy are probably still awake. Oh, that's great. A creep and a criminal. Nadine, just be careful in there, okay? I don't like the feel of this place. Don't worry about me. I'm a big girl now. Tell me about it. Nice lipstick. Nice... ahh... Whew. Mercy. Take it directly to the study... then I have more work you must do. Geez, what you got in here, boss, Hulk Hogan's barbells? Well, Mr. Johnson, are you ready for your transfusion? It's almost that time. I will be ready in an hour. Come to the study then. All right. This night I am transmitting the blood of phase 2. The study of phase 1 is in progress. Within 24 Earth hours... I shall locate and transmit a live Earth specimen. I have no information on my own probability of life or death. That's right, I put Mulligan on it. He probably won't find anything. Yes, sir... yes, sir... yeah, same puncture wounds as before. I'll let you know the minute we hear anything. That girl was a seventh, wasn't she? Eighth. Damn newspapers are having a field day. "Dracula strikes again." Is there any break yet? Nothing, but I'll tell you one thing... our boy is interested in only one thing... blood! Every body we've found has been drained white. What about the boys in the lab? Aw, hell, those guys don't even know the exact cause of death... let alone how the blood's being removed. Damn. You and the law agent... you are bound, Miss Storey? Why Mr. Johnson, I didn't know you cared. Merely the curiosity of a patient. Well, I guess you could say we're bound... bound for what, I don't know, but you could say it. Why? You ever been married before? My companion and I are... separated. Oh. Well, that about does it for today. Perhaps you can guide me... to a bit of information that I've not... yet discovered in my research. And what's that? In the uranium method of cancer examination... it is of course true that the uranium... goes directly to the cancerous region. But the books neglected to give an explanation. That's right, that's because no one knows the reason. That one assumption might be... that since cancer attracts radioactivity... it is possible that the cancer itself is negatively charged with energy. Perhaps that might lead to a cure. What do you think? I'm sure I don't think anything, Mr. Johnson. Why don't you just lie back now... and relax until a transfusion's finished. Very well. Hi, I'm your birthday girl. You are attempting to sell me a vacuum cleaner? No, silly, I'm your birthday girl. You know, from the Strip-O-Gram company. Strip-O-Gram? [?], that's crazy. Hold on... wait a minute. Look... you are... Albert Fleidimier, 405 North Madison? The address is 405 South Madison. Oh, God, I did it again. Look-look mister, I'm sorry... I just can't see a thing without my glasses. I hope I haven't disturbed you. Wait! Turn. You will follow me. I have brought the specimen. She is typical of the Earth sub-humans. She shall follow me back through the beam. With this transmission... phase 3 is completed. Soon you must complete phase 4... there is destruction within the council of the northern orbit. Destruction? Rule is dissolving... independent action increases on a 73 degree tangent. The result of phase 4... shall be known to me in 3 of the Earth's solar days. I shall return to Davanna and tell them so. It must be no more than 3 days. Enter the beam. Mr. Johnson didn't like this morning's fare? Hell, I don't even know why I bother... that guy never eats nothing. You're not exactly Julia Child, Jeremy. What was in this glass? H-2-O. Water? Come on, even L.A. water isn't this bad. It was okay when I took it to him. God, it's got a chemical smell. Maybe his Tang went bad. Jeremy, exactly how much do you know about Mr. Johnson? More than I like... and I can tell you stories about this guy. Why don't you start with telling me how you met? Promise not to tell your cop friend? Cross my heart. Okay. I was breaking into this place. No, seriously! I figure nobody's home cause it's dark, right? So I crack open a window and I sneak myself in... so I'm feeling my way along in the dark, and all of a sudden ba-boom... I bump into this guy Johnson, just standing there in the shadows. That'll teach you. And he don't even call the cops or nothing! Instead, he offers me a job at... two thou a week to take care of him. Extremely generous under the circumstances. Yeah, hell, I thought so. Anything else strange? Everything's strange, this place is like the roach motel... people check in, but they don't check out. What? The other night... Johnson picks up these 3 babes, right? And I go upstairs to my room... and they never left. And you think they're still somewhere in the house? Hell, I figure I'm not getting paid to think... but I'll tell you what... I'm starting to do a lot of it on my own spare time. Well, keep your eyes open too... I've got a list of unanswered questions about Mr. Johnson... and it's growing daily. At least we have something in common. Shared paranoia doesn't exactly make us lodge brothers, Jeremy. Just don't go back to a life of crime. Hey, you really do care about me. I'm just being practical. Hell, the next purse you snatch could be mine. Besides, I don't want to be alone here with Mr. Johnson. Jeremy, stay with me. A blood oath! I'll stick it out here as long as you do. So what's our first move? I think as Mr. Johnson's nurse... that it's my duty to take this glass down to the lab, and... find out what my patient's been putting inside himself. Instead of... Instead of food. Do you have any idea what it is? - None at all. - Where did you get it? That, doctor, is a secret I'll let you in on later. Let's just say it's a food supplement a friend of mine developed. Food supplement? Well, that something for an internist to analyze, not me. No, I think you'll find this very interesting. Nadine, it's for you. It's a police officer. Said something about leaving his nightstick with you last evening. I'll be right back. Doctor, I tested the blood sample on that dog bite victim last night. And? It's rabies, all right, a virulent case. Well, put it in the cooler, I'll have it disposed of later... then notify the hospital where he was transferred. Nightstick, huh? How 'bout I tell you where you can really put it? Come on, you can't take a joke? Sure, let's say we start with our relationship. Ooh, now that is a cold shot, Nadine... I am deeply pained by that. Can't help it, I'm a wise-ass at heart. What's happening? That depends on you. Free tonight? Depends on you, where we going? And don't say your apartment. Can't do it. I'm on duty at 11. I figure I'll take you to that new place over on La Brea. Oh, Donut Land? Of course not! Donut Land? Would you give me a break, huh? It took you there last night. Tonight, I am talking El Varos. Oh, since when can a cop like you afford a place like that? Since a cop like me nabbed the owner speeding... with someone other than his wife, thank you. You guys. All right, I'll meet you there around seven. - You got it. - 'kay, bye. I was gonna ask you to drop back here at 8 tonight. I should have those tests run by then. Damn, I really want to hear the results of those tests. Harry's taking me to El Varos, you know the place? Only from the outside, it's always booked. I know. I know, why don't I come in an hour early in the morning... we can go over the results then. - Sounds good. - Okay, good. And I will bring you a doggy bag. Why are you here? - I escaped. - Explain! The penalty for use of the warp is immediate dispatch. I had to do it. It was either escape or perish. - From what? - From the mobs! The council has ceased to exist. Your liaison has fled to the colony orbit. He will maintain contact. Why has this happened? The wars are finished. The blood supply vanishes. The enemy captives have been taken from their pastures... slaughtered, and their blood removed on the spot. And my companion? I'm sorry to transmit word of her demise. She too was terminated for her blood. You were justified in passing over. I am in need of blood. I sent a live specimen through the beam... was the sub-human not satisfactory? Your specimen arrived in a compressed state... her body crushed to the size of this vessel. Crushed? The department concluded it is impossible to transmit a human through the beam from this orbit. If the conclusion is correct... we'll be unable to return to Davanna. However, I shall send another specimen this night. If it is correct... we must remain upon this world until we expire. I prefer the barbarism of this planet to the present agony of Davanna. That is an emotional statement. It is an emotional time... and if I do not receive blood within 4 kronactins... I will have no continuing need for emotion. You shall have blood. At once? No, my supply here is diminished. In the dark of the Earth star... we travel to a place where we may obtain more. And my attire? There are appropriate female garments upstairs. But we are so similar. Here... you may wear these. Nadine... you've got to tell me where you got that stuff. Oh, hello Harry, I'm sorry to intrude, but this is extremely important. Don't mind me, doc. But where, you must tell me. Doctor, would you calm down, I've never seen you like this before. Relax, have a drink. I got it from a friend. Well, your friend must be an amazing person. That compound is fantastic! Not only does it contain every vitamin known to man, but a few I've never seen before. It has the basic food elements concentrated with... bulk, roughage, energy, and diet control, all of the same molecular structure. Molecular structure? You mean to tell me he's combined all this into a primary unit? - Yes. - No. Who is... He? Mr. Johnson. Oh. Doctor, do you think it's possible to reproduce Johnson's units? I think we've discussed that sufficiently. Hmm... Guess I'll have the breaded veal cutlets. Oh, doc, so glad you could join us. This place looks like an exhibit of ancient medical devices from a vocal age museum. This world is as ours of that time. Your observation is correct. Lie there on that plane. I shall bring the blood. Blood Contaminated. Caution: Rabid. Ah, this looks great! We make our own pastries on the premises, sir. - Enjoy. - Thank you. Doctor, don't you even want to discuss the supplement thing? No, my dear, I do not. I don't understand. Nadine, I've put in a long day. I've explained the compound to you, there's nothing more to it. Now, I'd like to eat my dessert, and get back to the clinic. - Doctor, I just... - Sounds good to me, doc. - Listen, I just... - Nadine, let the man eat. Let him eat. Fine. Eat. It is finished. Do you feel relieved? I feel disturbed. The blood of this planet is rich... soon you will find strength. Rise. We must leave this place. There-there is activity within me. It will pass. To the egress. We proceed to your dwelling? No, you must not be observed there. There is a collective dwelling 50 decopeds in that direction. I will be alone among the sub-humans. I do not know how to behave. This is their bartering specie. A clerk will speak to you vocally. Imitate his sounds and meanings... and give him of that whatever he asks. You will remain in contact? I will come to the hotel place at the noon of the Earth star. Hey, baby, where you goin'? You don't look so good. Whatever you had... was pretty bad. Hey, what you need is [?]. Yeah, wake up your tired blood. Oh, honey, that's too bad... But you know, Soxy's got a point... I want you to step right here into my office... You will cease all force. Hear that, Jug, she wants us to stop. Yeah, we can do that baby, depends on how much bread you got? I have no edibles. She can dish it out, guys. We got ourselves a real comedian here. Only I'm not laughing, sweetheart. Maybe now she'll loosen up. Shit, if she ain't got no bucks, we outta at least get our pound of flesh. Yeah! I get her first. Like hell you do. Yeah, you're forgetting one thing, assholes. Fluffy. Here Fluffy. C'mere, girl. Come on, Fluffy. C'mere. Fluffy. C'mere. Haven't seen a poodle around here, have you? A little white one? Hey, you're freaking me out, come on, what... And you know where it takes me? Taco King, can you believe it, give me a break. She's still alive. Let's get her into my office! - Fantastic. - She's slipping, doctor. She's gone. I'll get those glasses off. Better get an ophthalmologist. And Mary... notify the police. Hello. Where you been, kid, I've been trying to reach you for 10 minutes. Well, I just got in, can't get enough, huh? What's up. Nadine, you know that black evening dress you have... the one you wore to the police benefit? Sure, it's upstairs in my closet. It's still got the mayor's fingerprints all over it. Well, is it still there? Well, I haven't checked it in the last few hours... if that's what you mean. Harry, what's this all about? Nadine, a woman died tonight at the clinic... and she had no ID, and we couldn't trace her prints. Harry, skip the police science, let's get to the point. Nadine, the dead woman was wearing an identical dress. Harry, I designed that dress myself, it's a one of a kind. I think she's tied up with Johnson. How can you be sure? Well, I'm not, and Rochelle's performing an autopsy on her right now. Look, there's something strange going on around here... and Johnson's is right in the middle of it. Now, soon as the docs finished, I'm coming over. All right, in the meantime, Jeremy and I are gonna... do a little investigating on our own. Nadine, I'd feel a lot better if you guys were out of there. I can take care of myself. Nadine, I... Where's Johnson? Nadine, things are getting even weirder, I mean... I'm seeing people leave that never showed up. What? Two hours ago, I saw Johnson leave with a babe I never saw come in. Did she look at all like Mr. Johnson? They coulda been Bobbsey twins. What was she wearing? Something black and slinky in all the right places. All right, now's our chance to search the place... if we can find something on Johnson... Harry'll probably kiss you personally. It's okay, I'll settle for a handshake. But what are we looking for, anyway? I don't know, but we'll know when we find it. C'mon, let's start in the cellar. Okey-doke. Find anything? Nope, nothing yet, what about you? Oh, here's a bottle of pills. I've never seen anything like these before. I think we're on to something, right? What's this? I don't know. Whoa! Now we've really got something. But what is it? I don't think I'd like to know. Whatever it is, no one from this Earth made it. You think the boss is some kind of Man from Mars or something? I don't care if he's Darth Vader, I'm gonna wreck this... Well, wait, I don't think you should screw around... it might blow up or something. I never screw around. Wow, you couldn't bust this with a 20 pound sledge. There's nothing more we can do up here. I'm gonna keep looking around. You go down in the cellar and see what you can find. What, you're not gonna go down with me? Would you go! Okey-doke. Hello. Hello. - Hello. - Nadine? Yes, doctor. Harry told you about the woman who died here tonight? Yeah, he said she was connected in some way with Johnson. This has nothing to do with our patient. The woman seems to lack any visible aperture in the optical tissue. And she has a fantastic blood disease in which the aaglutinin is disintegrating. Disintegrating? Is that what killed her? No, she died of an advanced case of rabies. Incredible as it may sounds, it destroyed all her blood cells in less than an hour. That's impossible! That's what I would have said too, but it's a fact. I had some type "O" rabies virus stored in the cooler. Someone broke in here tonight, and injected her with the same blood. Who would do such a horrible thing? Someone who knew she needed blood desperately... but didn't know what kind of stuff he was pumping into her. I'd said it was Johnson. Hello. About this woman... I think I know the cause and treatment of her disease. - You do? - Yes. Apparently, the victim has lived in an area that has been constantly charged with radioactive materials... it was this atmosphere that affected the blood. Where would such an atmosphere be found? In a place where continuous nuclear detonations... have taken place over a period of years. An area of all out nuclear warfare. But... there is no such place. I realize this sounds like science fiction, but um... I believe this woman is something other than human. I see... and what would be your treatment? First, removal from the toxic atmosphere, then a complete change of blood. Will this cure Johnson? I am not speaking of Johnson! Well, he fits your description! Nadine, please. Doctor, does this man have some kind of hold on you? Has he threatened your life? What? Nadine, I really must hang up now, I have a great deal of work to do. Doctor Rochelle... The doctor is no longer in contact, Miss Storey. Mr. Johnson. Do not leave your room. Stop! Stay exactly where you are. You do not control me. But I am controlling you, Nadine. You have no choice but to obey me. You will be the next subject I send to Davanna. Hey, Klingon! Do not struggle, Nadine. I am going to dispatch you. I'm not gonna open my eyes. This will only take a moment, Nadine. Your death will be quick, and painless. You killed, Jeremy! There is no place for you to hide. You may conceal your person... but I can find your mind. Damn... it's still busy, doc. Operator, I need to make an emergency phone call. Doctor Rochelle's office. Harry, Johnson's after me. Nadine! He's gonna kill me. Where are you? Picnic grounds parking lot. Stay there, I'm gonna get help. I can't... Nadine. Nadine! Nadine! Call the station, tell Simmons to meet me at the picnic grounds. I'm on my way there! You can not run forever, Nadine. Your friend can not help you. Stop running. Stop running! I'm coming. I'm coming closer, Nadine. Stop running! Face me. My strength has returned. It has returned. The first specimen I sent to Davanna was crushed. I shall send another. It shall be you. It shall be me. We will walk to the automobile. Hey, I don't see either of 'em. We're gonna separate here! You take the road to the north side. - I'll take the one by the zoo. - You got it. Simmons, no sirens! I am about to be attacked. I shall dispose of the intruder. Return to the house and enter the transmission beam in my study. Slide the power lever. It will send you to Davanna. It will send me to Davanna. Nadine! - Did Johnson do this? - Yes. - How? - With his eyes. - Was that him? - Yes. Hey, look, stay here! I'm going after him. Look at my eyes. Look at me. 'Here Lies A Man Who Was Not Of This Earth'. In a way I feel sorry for him. Why sorry? Buried so far from home... away from everything he knew. I can't feel sorry for him... he had no emotions as we know them. He was just a foreign thing that came here to destroy us. Thank God he tried too hard. Yeah, come on.
