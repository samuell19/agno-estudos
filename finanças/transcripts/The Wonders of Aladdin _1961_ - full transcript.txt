I want a lamp for my boy, Aladdin. What kind of a lamp? - What does your boy Aladdin do? - Do? What do any of the young people do? He lies around the house all day sleeping and dreaming and breathing up air, and then at night, he prowls around Baghdad. Last night he came home with a black eye. He fell down in the dark, he says. How much is a lamp? - Excellent lamp, 50 pice. - Fifty pice? It's cheaper to rub ointment on him. Wait! Here is a bargain. Take it for 10 pice, but no complaints, no bringing it back, no matter what. Is there something wrong with it? You wanted a cheap lamp, here's a cheap lamp. - Take it. - Probably it does not light. Or it smokes? No, no. It makes noises sometimes. People bring it back. Other noises. - Nine pice. - Take it and go. Remember, no bringing it back! Make way! Stand back! Male slaves, go to the back of the room. Back, back, back, back. Female slaves, come forward. Forward, forward, forward. Oh, good girl. You will be promoted. Mama, royalty! Royal trumpets! Hey, Mama, did you hear me? It's the prince! Well, give him my regards. Yeah, but Mama, the prince! Come and see! Oh, will you ever stop all this dreaming about the rich and the great? Never! Ah! Aladdin! What was that? Who fell through the roof? Oh, it was only a little boy. He ran out. It was some little boy, all right. You were up there gawking at the procession, weren't you? Djalma, it was the prince on his way to the royal city of Basora for his wedding. Oh, it's going to be the wedding of the age, of the century! - It'll be the most fantastic... - Terrible! Terrible! Who cares about royal weddings? Will you ever learn to sit cross-legged and weave rugs for a living like your father before you? - Never! - Aladdin! When anything happens, it's always Aladdin! Now, wait, Father. Leave him alone. He's not very bright. All men can't be as bright as you. Oh, Djalma, you have a head on your shoulders. Everybody's going to Basora for the wedding. I'm not and you're not. Unless you've found enough money for passage on a caravan. They say the floors of the palace are inlaid with shining porphyry. What's porphyry? Well, it's a thing that they... Well, they put it... They have it on a long st... They... I don't know. How is your eye? Hmm? Oh, it's fine. I told you it was nothing. You haven't said anything about the new lamp I bought you. Now you can have light at night like a rich man. Mama, you're too nice to me. Yes, I am. Eat your soup. Where's yours? I ate before. You spent everything for that lamp. Here, you eat the soup or it'll be wasted. - I'm gonna get your money back. - No. Anyway, he said he wouldn't take it back. Which lamp man was it? Was it the big one or the little one? The little one. He'll take it back. And then I said to him, "Stay here! Wait! Good, wonderful girl." Thief! Catch him! Somebody catch that thief! Hey, hey, hey! - Catch the thief! - How much? How much will you pay me for bringing him back upside down? Half! Half of what he stole! Come on! Stop him! Come back here! Come back here! My shoes! He's stolen my shoes! Here are some presents for you in return for the use of your tacks. Thanks. I will break every bone in his body! Whoa! There he is! Get off of me. Come on. Atsu, Master. How may I be of service? - Who are you? - I am a genie. I am your creature, here to do what you wish. What is your first wish? You have three. My wish is not to get my bones broken by this idiot giant! Did you say something? Stand back! I'll break that door down! Everything is relative. Satisfactory, Master, eh? Wonderful, thank you! - Call me anytime. - I will! But how? The same way you called me this time. Now, genie, genie, please, will you wait? No... genie? Ow, my foot! You're standing on my foot! Oh, Master, forgive me everything. Please let me go! - I could crush you like a nut. - Don't! Or squeeze you like a grape. Spare me and I will be your slave for life! I will cook for you, run your errands, punish your enemies! I am yours and so is all I possess! And what do you possess? These clothes, Master. Three dinar and a few pice. - They're yours. - Thank you, slave! That should be enough to get us passage - with a caravan. - Passage, Master? - Where to? - To a wedding! In Basora. Genie? Genie? Genie? You've lost your magic, Master? Oh, no, certainly not. Come! Oh, one pace to the rear, if you don't mind. Oh! Oh, and bring that old lamp. I may want you to light my way. Closed for the night! Djalma, it's me, Aladdin! Is your father there? No, he's not! Then will you please let me in? I'm going absolutely crazy! Oh, me too. But I don't dare let you in. Father would beat us both! Well, if you won't let me in, then will you please tell me what you and your father have for fleas? They're driving me mad! So that's all you came for. Flea powder? I must admit, that's the biggest flea I ever saw! You think that's big, a few minutes ago, they were like that! Oh, Aladdin, one of your dreams again? No, I don't think so. Closed for the night! Is my master in there, the Wizard Aladdin? It's my slave, Omar! You see, I wasn't dreaming! They were right where you said they'd be, and my shoes, too! Oh, you wait right there. Yes, Master. Aladdin, please, begin at the beginning! Well, I have a genie. Oh, either tell me or don't tell me, but no more of your lies. Djalma, I have a genie! Djalma, I'm going to be rich and powerful and never go hungry again. And you're gonna be rich, too! Goodbye. I must go take leave of my mother. I'm off to Basora! Floors inlaid with shining porphyry! How can you go to Basora? In addition to a genie, you have money all of a sudden? Well, enough for me and my slave Omar in a caravan. Oh, Aladdin, take me instead. Marry me and take me with you? Marry you? Little sister should stay at home. I'm not your sister! Well, I think of you that way. I've known you since you were wearing diapers. Tell me, do you still wear them? I remember you were so cute, you were... - Wait! - I'll diaper you, you... Here's some more powder, you flea! Let us hope that my bride will be one half as pretty as that little street girl. Princess Zaina is said to be very beautiful, Excellency. When royalty is said to be beautiful, it often just means that all 10 fingers and all 10 toes are present. This is our caravan, Master! It was much the cheapest. This is our caravan? The men look like bandits and the camels are grandparents! What? This way. This is the chief of the caravan. We are your passengers, sir. - Going to Damascus, eh? - Yes! No, no, Basoral! Oh, yes, well, follow me. Get in the cart with the other passengers. Lambs to Basora. I've heard of lambs to something, but it wasn't Basora. - What was it? - Slaughter. The Grand Vizier himself. Bow down! Stand firm! - Excellency. - Excellency. Have I suddenly diminished in rank? Oh, yes, yes. All hail to His Excellency, the Grand Vizier of Basora! You may rise. I am glad, sire, that I may. Unfortunately, I cannot. You are kindness personified. Was your tour of the sultanate successful? Eminently. One way or another, we collect our taxes. Have you finished making the present I ordered? I have! My dancing doll! A masterpiece of magic and cunning! He has a flute, and when that flute is played, he dances! I presume this will be your present to Princess Zaina. You gibbering idiot! Have you made the doll with the face of the prince? Prince Moluk? Of course, Excellency, of course! I thought the face of the bridegroom... Magician, I do not intend to let our princess marry that foreigner Moluk! She will have a bridegroom who is a man. Cover that wretched face! I shall. He will have another face by morning. What about the other doll? Wonderful. Careful! Ooh, careful. Guard? Almighty Excellency? Soldier, there is a young woman here who wishes to meet you. Lift up your eyes. Well, go on, boy, go on. I know what it is to be young and eager. Good! That will be my present to the the sultan after I have disposed of the prince and married Zaina myself. That is if she is one half as beautiful as is said. You aim high, Excellency! And I hit high. - I do not fail. - Sire? - Yes? - The man you wished to see secretly is here. Good. Come in. Is all well? All in hand? I have made a pretense of organizing a public caravan. I have even taken two passengers. We will go out of this city ahead of the prince. Less suspicious. Good, and remember, I want the prince alive. I'll dispose of him myself. Aladdin! Aladdin! Oh, going off after that young nobody, that idler. Believe me, it is stupid! Well, it's stupid to be a woman, but I am and I love it. I can't let him go all the way to Basora without me. He needs me! What a good wife you'll make. And how wasted it will be on him. Especially as he refuses to have me. Ride! Sir? Do you sell passage to Basora on your caravan? Full, all full. Brahim, look! There's that pretty girl again. Sir, my daughter wishes passage to Basora. - Can you take her? - No. Sell her passage on my caravan. Yes, Highness. Young lady, I have heard that you seek passage to Basora. I am in power to sell of you such passages in the caravan of His Royal Highness, - Prince Moluk. - Truly? How much will it be? Half of what you have. Half of what I have? How do you know what I have? The price is half of what you have. Follow me. Salaam, Excellency! Muzda, are you still able to climb? Apparently you are! You are to go to Basora and climb the palace walls. There, privately view the Princess Zaina, whose face no man has ever seen except, of course, her father, the sultan. I want a portrait of her face and, if possible, of her body. I wish to know if she is as fair as rumor says. That will be done, Excellency. Ride like the wind and return to me as soon as possible. Ooh, there are two men! - Two men! - It's all right, ladies, they're blindfolded. It's the jeweler and his assistant. Zaina, they've come with the bridal jewels for you! Are you quite certain they are tightly blindfolded? You know my father would have them beheaded! And I can't believe it would be worth it to them. This one. And this one! And this one. That is more than enough jewelry, even for such a happy wedding. Thank you, good jeweler, it was very kind of you to come. Ah, Princess Zaina, it is you who are kind. Happiness, long life, abundance for all your days! Thank you very much! Help! Help! So, we consider through the conjunction of the moon, the planet Saturn, the planet Mercury, and we also took into consideration the shadow of the planet Jupiter. Get to the point! Yes, oh, Magnificent Sultan! Immediately, immediately! Where was I? Oh, in short, Highness, in short, the news is the best! My prophecy is that your gracious and pregnant queen will be delivered on the very day Princess Zaina is to wed. And the baby will be a fine, healthy boy! Allah be praised! What about my daughter's marriage? Will she be happy? There are strange and worrisome portents in the chart of the prince. Death is in his chart. Violent death. This is going to be a beautiful, beautiful afternoon. Ride! Wait a minute! Hey, wait! Hey, wait a minute! Wait! Hey, you come back here! Wait a minute! We paid for passage! I'll kill you all! Come back here! Master. Master, travelers die out here. We are in the middle of the Desert of Tribulation. Yeah, I fear you speak the truth! Why don't you summon your genie, Master? - What? - Summon your genie! Oh, yes! Yes, of course! But there are several things I have to do first. They're the same things that I did the last time that he appeared. Of course, they're very secret things. - I won't look, Master. - Oh, thank you. I can't remember, I just can't seem to remember! You're a peculiar type of wizard, Master. - In what way? - Well, other wizards seem to know what they're doing. Well, I happen to have a very difficult type of genie. Genie? Ooh, ooh. Oh! Prince, sire! - May I speak? - Yes, yes. Tell me, how soon will we get to Basora? Sire, forgive me, but the caravan is in danger. - Truly? - Armed riders have been scouting us! Bandits, we fear attack! Ow! Prepare bags of water. These brigands usually resort to fire arrows... Primitive but effective. Go. And you! Tell your men to dig small holes, the sort a large fox might make. Yes, sir! They're bandits, probably slave traders! If I were an attractive young woman, I'd kill myself before I'd let them take me! But then you're not an attractive young woman. Ismael, your men make the first attack. Forward! I observe we are badly outnumbered. A desperate trick comes to mind. Let your horsemen go around both flanks and attack the attackers from the sides. Yes, sir! What's happened to the prince? I don't know! But whatever it is, it's a good thing. Mount! Ah! Thank you, Highness. Chew a little hashish, it'll diminish the pain. I fear I will not be able to fight in your defense, Prince. True. Soldier, if these bandits capture me, they could hold me for ransom. Thousands of dinars would have to be paid out of the royal treasury. Let's prepare for the worst and try to foil them. Here is my royal ring. Change clothes and ornaments with me. I am known to paint my fingers and toes. We will have yours done, too. Oh, and you'll have to take off that beard. Royal horse guards fighting bravely and intelligently? I never thought I'd live to see that. Now for the main attack, follow me, ho! Well, where have you been? I came as quickly as I could, sir! Your Highness! Ah! Ahh! Ah! Let me go! Let me go! Water! Water! Where? Where? I'm having another mirage. Me too! Mine's wasting good water. Mine, too. If we both see it... Thank you. You know what I've been wondering, Omar? What, Master? Why is it everyone wants to go to Basora when they could be captured by Amazons? Her Majesty! Hello! Ow! Everyone outweighs me. Tell me something, what's going on? The queen came to choose one of you for herself for tonight. Congratulations, Omar. Looks like you win. She's beautiful. I'll tell you all about it, Master. Thank you. Tell me, what is... Wait a minute, what happened? Where did you go? Look, what was she doing this for? She likes skins that contrast with hers. And in the morning, the one she chooses always gets killed and he's made into a scarf. Ooh! And what happens to the one that's not chosen? The one she doesn't choose? Oh, he goes to the rest of us! And in the morning, he's made into many little kerchiefs - for each of us. - Oh, little... Oh, that's wonderful. Her Majesty has shown her democracy and her generosity once again. Not wishing to be greedy, she has taken the little one for herself. The big one is ours! No, no! Please, please, no! I don't deserve it! Master! Master, call your genie! Genie! What are you gonna do with those? Your clothes will be given to the poor. Oh. Do you have my address? What's that for? Be patient, the queen will be here very soon. You'll never forget the last night of your life. Now, listen! You just come out of the lamp! I just rub the lamp! Why didn't you tell me you come out of the lamp? Forgive me, Master, but when you have lived in only one place for 1,200 years, you rather expect that everyone will know where to find you. How may I be of service? Well, you can... oh, no. No, no, with just two more wishes, I want to phrase this one very carefully. You're a little smaller than you were last time. Can you still do everything? I think so. Now, what can I do for you? Oh, with each wish you get smaller, is that it? Until at last I am released from that cursed lamp, and I fly away to eternal place. Twelve hundred years... is a long time. Precisely, where are we? Oh, we're in the bed chamber of the Queen of Amazons, and she'll be here in a minute, and she's gonna kill me. You exaggerate. No, no, she's gonna strangle me! So, will you please save me and my slave, Omar? Will you get us outta here? Certainly, master, if you... You may now approach me. Now, genie, how! Hmm? I said, will you please get us outta here? Any special place? Well, as long as I have a choice, somewhere near Prince Moluk. Where am I? It's all right, Omar, you're with me. Hey, I found out how to call my genie. He's transporting us to wherever Prince Moluk is. In the royal palace, I should imagine. Move on, keep up with the others! Master, what about this genie of yours? He certainly seems to have slipped up. Wait, who's that? Is that Prince Moluk? - Where have you been, friend? - I must know, is that the prince? So I've heard it said. See, the genie did as I asked him to. It's not his fault the prince was captured by bandits. Ah, Aladdin! Djalma! You've come to rescue me? - Oh, yes, yes. - How did you get here? Well, to tell the truth, we were captured by Amazons, but my genie got us out. - See you in Basora. - Yes, dear. Hurry, strip the prince - of his robe! - Get the robes and jewels! We'll take them to the Grand Vizier. Dead, Prince Moluk dead. Bandits, huh? Bandits. My poor Zaina, on the eve of her wedding. You, Grand Vizier, inform the populous there will not be a royal wedding. Great Sultan, is it wise to cancel the wedding? To make a wedding, it takes two, doesn't it? But think, sire, if you should have another baby girl, and, uh, with a succession of the throne... Depending on the birth - of a son to the royal family... - I've been told that the child will be a boy. Yes, Highness, but if it is not, and considering your advanced age, and the unlikelihood that you will produce any more children, I suggest that you, um... give Zaina to me. - Huh? - I am... rich, powerful, and the father of 27 sons. She's a plain girl. You wouldn't want her. Hers is the most beautiful face I ever beheld, |I... You've seen Zaina - when she was unveiled? - Certainly not! Certainly not, but the women of my harem have talked to the women of your harem. I will consider it. Thank you. Oh, and while considering, do consider also I am your largest single creditor. Well, there's one dancing doll that no longer looks like Prince Moluk. I hope for once the Grand Vizier is satisfied. Ooh, oh! I'm sorry, your Excellency, you frightened me. Well, Magician, I have been to see the Sultan. All is proceeding according to plan. Have you taken steps to ensure that the baby born to the queen will be female? I have found three women who should give birth at the same time as the queen. The mathematical probabilities are that one or more of these babies will be girls. Oh, what astonishing places my search has taken me. Go on, man, go on! What is the rest of your plan? If the royal baby is a boy, as your brother, the astrologer, prophesied, how will you substitute the female? All the royal midwives are in our employ, Excellency. Excellent, excellent. I have brought you your prince intact. Good, you are a good man. I am surrounded by good, good men. Let us see his royal, beautiful, decadent highness. The payment, sire? A payment? Now let us see him. Kneel, Highness, before the Grand Vizier! Prince? You call this buffoon Prince Moluk? Foiled, foiled and ruined! My plans have been corrupted by idiocy! I am served by animals in human form! Gold, you wanted gold for this? I will have you pinned with knives upside down to a wall. I will then have this gold piece by piece. Your Excellency, we took the whole caravan prisoner. If this is not the prince, then one of the others is. Then take me where the others are. Lead, insect brain! And you look out, too. You're all bunglers! My daughter, we are of royal blood. Our hearts are not our own, nor our bodies. If my baby is not a boy, then you must marry the Grand Vizier. Cry, child. Dry-eyed grief is the grief that never ends. Once, I looked through the lattice, and saw Prince Moluk. I saw his face. Now I will never marry anyone else. Uh... we will talk again. Careful, Omar, careful! You don't wanna be a prisoner all your life, do ya? Of all the things that were taken away from us, all they worry about is that silly old lamp. It's no good. We'll all be sold as slaves. No, we won't. There's gotta be a way outta here. Fly, you great wizard. - Yeah. - May we'll sell as a couple. What are you looking at? That tree! We use the rope to bend back the tree, Djalma holds onto the top of the tree, and joop, we send her flying over the wall, and into the river! - It could be done, master. - Yeah! And after I land in the river, then what do I do? I can't swim! You can't swim? - Omar... - Nor I, master. All right, then I'll hold onto the top of the tree. Then I'll go over the wall, and I'm gonna land in the... I can't swim, either! There's always gotta be some detail that ruins everything. I can swim. What... That would... We're the ones that gotta get outta here. Help me get out of here, and I will be able to save you all. I will go straight to the Sultan, and you will be rescued. Yeah, but the Sultan receives petitioners once every three years, I don't think we can wait. I'm not really a common soldier, I'm a noble. I can approach the Sultan. Are these the hands of a commoner? Not a callus. What are you doing? Just wanna see if he has a long life line. There he is! There's Prince Moluk! - You're the prince? - Forgive us, Highness, - forgive us, we... - Just get me outta here! - Oh, yes, yes. - After him! Halt! Run, you fools, catch him! Stand away from that tree! Guards, guards! Stop him! Stop him! Stop! Hurry up! Let go of me, hey! You will pay for this. After him, stop him! Tear him apart! You are done! Riot guards! Get up, guards, get up! - Up the pole! - Omar! - Come on. - Hold it steady. - Hurry up, Omar. - After them! Catch them, or I will have your heads! Are you cripples? Are you paralyzed? Stop it! Help, Omar, help me! Omar, don't let go. Stop it! Come on, let's go down here. The lamp, maybe we can reach it now. I don't think I can, Aladdin. Omar! I got an idea. - Help me move the bellows out here. - Yes, master. What's that? Oil. Oil in the bellows, what for? Don't ask so many questions, just hold the flame in front of that thing. Push. Push! Come on. Push! Push! - Run, Djalma, run! - Seize her, seize her! No, no! Now you take your hands off that girl. You heard what I said. You take your hands off of that... Watch out for that animal! - Kill you, I'll kill you! - Do you know... Do you know what happens to those who thwart my plans, who aid my enemies? No, what? Where is Moluk hiding? I don't know. And they don't know. Maybe he drowned. Guards, torture these two men until they tell us of their plot. I'll torture the girl at home. Djalma! Djalma! Good people of Basora, the confinement of our Sultan's gracious queen has begun. Let the prayers of the populous go upward to Allah that this baby be a boy. Alms, alms? Alms? Why have you come back to Basora? Everybody's in Basora this night. Alms, alms? Alms for the love of Allah? What are you doing there? That's my place, get away from there! My dear fellow, I have been away, it is true, but I used to beg here. My father before me begged here. His father before him. There always has been one of my family on the bed of nails on this spot since before these walls were built. Pain is holy, I am holy, give alms, I will pray for you. Pain is holy, I am holy, give alms, I will pray for you. Would you pray for me for two golden dinars? For two golden dinar, sir, I would pray quite a long time, quite a long time. I suppose that you know you're very wet? If one of your family has been in this spot since before these walls were built, you must know a lot about the walls. You are awfully wet to be a student of architecture. One has heard of secret entrances and secret passageways within the walls. You are not a commoner. What is your title? Three golden dinars for a little information. You are Prince Moluk. - Certainly not. - Yes, you are, I know. I used to lie outside of the walls of your father's palace in Fado. When you were very young, you and your brothers chased me with sticks. Now, what can I do for you? Is there a secret way into the palace? Perhaps. Lead me to it. I will give you four golden dinars. Payable late? You'll cheat me, and the Sultan's guards will draw and quarter me. This way, sire. Now then, girl, where is Moluk hiding? Where is Moluk? Perhaps I shouldn't mention this, but, uh... When I want your advice, I'll ask for it. Fireworks, sire, to amuse the crowd outside while they await the royal birth. Yes, let the people have their simple pleasures. Sire... there is a woman here who begs audience with you or the magician. She carries in her arms a newborn infant girl. Quiet! Quiet, little about-to-be-a-princess! Quiet, huh? So, do you like that? Do you like the Grand Vizier's wedding present to Princess Zaina? The time approaches. Do you have the girl baby ready? What do you think this is, a crocodile? What will happen after we exchange babies? Quiet, little about-to-be-a-midwife. Take my hand, Highness. Why, can you see? No, but take my hand anyway. Come. Come, come. We are going down, down, down - into the dungeons. - Press on. Oh, we are below one of the underground chambers. Oh, oh, oh, oh! I know that girl. I know her, too. Help me. Acid. Courage, you'll be free in a moment. Good evening. Where is Aladdin? Is he all right? What a very affecting first thing to say. Thank you for saving me. But where's Aladdin? I don't know, I'm trying to find my way to the Sultan to get help. In the meantime, they may have killed him. - Wait! - I won't wait, I'm going to Aladdin. Good evening, your Highness. We'll have you down in a minute. Oh, Aladdin, are you all right? Did they hurt you? Did they torture you? Well, no, not yet, it's supposed to start at dawn. You see, when the sun heats these skins, they're supposed to shrink, squashing us. It's very scientific. The prisoners are escaping, take them! Run, follow me! Hurry! Oh, ugh, ugh, oh. I do not understand. I didn't enjoy it. Well, you see, there's a genie inside, and when he comes out... - Hurry up! - ...he's supposed to... Come! Ah! You go to the other panel. - What is it? - What's wrong? It's all right. Some fireworks exploded inside, that's all. It's a girl! A princess is born to the queen! Hurry now, this way. Such a pretty little boy. - What a shame he must be Killed. - Go on, go on, go on. Why wait? Smother the brat now. Hang him on the wall. Victory, victory on all sides. I will rule, and my sons will rule after me until the end of time. - Congratulations, sire. - Thank you. Someone has taken that girl down. Magician! Yes, sir? Come here, come here, my Magician. That nice, naked, half-tortured girl I had hanging right here, what happened to her? It's quite a long story, Excellency. You know the boy child who was born to Her Majesty, the queen? You have killed him, I presume? I was just about to kill him, but the little fellow was stolen from my hands. What? The prince, he lives? - Yes, sir. - Yes, sir. Well, where is he, where is he, you fools? A band of thieves attacked us and stole him. Ugh, the wedding must be performed right now. Zaina must become my wife before any of this is discovered. - Hurry! - Yes, your Excellency. I will arrange for an immediate wedding. Sire, I hope you'll find it in your heart to forgive this woman... and me. No... Excellency, think of all the successful things I have done for you. Think good thoughts. Hate corrodes. - Hate is bad for you. - You have jeopardized my life's work. An infant boy five minutes old escapes you. A naked, bound, and shackled girl escapes you! You never did tell me what happened to her. Answer me before you go! What happened? Well. Hear, oh hear, people of Basora. This night, a royal marriage will be performed. Pray for the happy couple, Princess Zaina and the Grand Vizier. Highness, the Grand Vizier begs leave to offer his bride a small token, which will be presented by a mechanical doll of wondrous ingenuity made by a brilliant, but recently deceased, magician. And now, Great Sultan... the beggars and fakirs wish to bring wedding gifts. - The beggars? - If you will but give word - to admit them. - Highness, uh, this doll is somewhat exceeding its capabilities. Admit the beggars, Highness, and you will never regret it. Are the beggars craving admittance? They are, sire. Admit them. But, Highness... Admit them! Come, little doll. Oh, Great Sultan, accept our most precious gift. Prince Moluk? But you're dead! I live... and so does your infant son. He was kidnapped by order of the Grand Vizier. Riot guards, assemble! Royal guards, arrest him! Princess, this way! Aladdin, behind you! Djalma! Hear me, courtiers of Basora... and hear me well. Hence forth, I intend to rule in Basora. At dawn, open the city gates to me, and welcome me as a ruler. Otherwise, I will attack, and destroy all who resist me. Aladdin! Master? - Good morning, doc. - Good morning. Still unconscious, eh? - He cried out once. - What did he say? He said, uh, "Male slaves to the back of the room, female slaves forward." The Sultan has asked for him. He wishes to present him with a declaration for bravery, a medal of gold and diamonds to be worn about his neck. He has named Aladdin the new Grand Vizier. Men, we'll use plan B. Please. Your Highness, horsemen five leagues away! Man the battlements! Riot guards to the east wall! Faster! Faster! Djalma! Djalma! Genie! Genie! Gen... Genie! Genie! Where are ya? Genie, come on now, this is no time to be difficult. Genie! Atsu, master. What happened to the rest of you? You live your life, and I live what's left of mine. How may I serve you? Save Djalma, the Grand Vizier took her away. Just that? Your last wish? It is not for wealth or power? Yeah, well, I do want something else. Look, I got... ow. Can I phrase the wish so I could have two things? Uh-huh. You see, I wanna save Djalma, and I wanna get my hands around the Grand Vizier's neck, and I wanna squeeze, and squeeze, and squeeze... - Atsu, master. - ...and squeeze. What are we doin' here? Oh, look at the... What is that? Courage. I'm gonna kill him. I'm gonna kill him myself, you understand? Yes, master. In the meantime, I do think we could make it part of the same wish for me to stop all the cavalry. I really have no desire to be trampled on, all right? - All right. - Thank you. - You, you again! - I'm gonna kill you. Victory! Well. At least hold onto the sword. Hey! No help, now. I wanna do this myself. Will ya stop it, I told you I could handle this man. A thousand apologies. I don't know where you obtained this magic of yours, but I will kill you anyway. Magic or no magic, I am going to kill you. There, I told you I could do it myself. Yes, master. Hmm? Now, where's Djalma? Aladdin! Why did I always think of you as my little sister? Oh! How did you do that? How did you get me down So quickly? Oh, my genie did it. Oh, Aladdin. Will you ever tell the truth about anything? You don't have a genie. Oh.
