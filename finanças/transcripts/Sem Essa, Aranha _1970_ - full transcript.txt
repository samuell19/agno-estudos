NO WAY, SPIDER A BELAIR PRODUCTION Boys. For you... why don't you do what everyone else does? Sell the same car three or four times. It's the only way out of the crisis. A country of anonymous writers, anonymous doctors, a society of castaway scholars. Is it Wednesday or Thursday? I don't know whether it's Wednesday or Thursday. Did you marry the masses or me? I honestly don't know. But Brazil needs me more than you need my money. You forget our children. I never forgot my children, but nor can I forget the 80 million Brazilians. Don't kid yourself, you can't blackmail me. I'm your wife, I can knock you down whenever I like. If you want a divorce I can give you one right now! I wouldn't give you the satisfaction. I have my standards I'm the only one who thinks about my children, no one else. I think about my children too, but when I get to ten million, I stop thinking about them. ...Informs distinguished patrons it will not be held responsible for umbrellas or other objects stolen during this show. Ladies and gentlemen, we are truly experiencing a real Brazilian moment. Waiter, two Cuba libres! I wonder haven't you realized that my love is all yours? I wonder... do I have to cry, for you to believe me? I wonder... do you already have someone else? If so, I won't love anyone! My dear, I need you I can't live without you Without you I can't go on... I wonder... I wonder... I wonder... Attention! Stop! Hello girls, good bye. Being handsome is a drag. When He made me, God was suffering from a superiority complex. Don't laugh. Laugh at a nearsighted airport. That's funny. All I wanted was to do away with the mistakes of the last sixty centuries. It's been six thousand years. It's been six thousand years. It's been six thousand years. If the earth's 200 billion inhabitants knew what I was thinking now, what I'm planning, if they understood the activities of the 200 billion, of the 200 bosses. That's when you need to drop the bombs. Attention, I've done everything a white man could do Jerks! A new age is dawning. Six thousand years weigh heavily upon me. Striptease! If I have to get married again, I've said it a thousand times, I've said it a thousand times, I won't marry a man. Men are worse than Indians. Who spit on the stairs? Is that any place to spit? Who spit on the stairs? It isn't known for certain whether or not he believes. His God suddenly spits blood. While the virgin surrenders to a certain Hungarian for a few pieces of yellow metal. The night of September 15 fell like a swing. My God, oh my God, September has passed, October and November we're already in December my God what is to become of us! My God, oh my God That's how the poor speak in the Northeastern drought afraid of pestilence, and famine! Oh, oh, oh... On the 13th of the month, he did an experiment, he lost his faith on rocks of salt. My God, oh my God, one more hope, he holds tight, thinking of the muddy waters of a happy Christmas. Oh, oh, oh... Christmas came and went, but the muddy waters didn't come The red sun rose far beyond, My God, oh my God, from the top of the trees, the cicada sings, no one sees the muddy waters, for there are none. Oh, oh, oh... Without rain on the land, January is disappointing, then February in the same summer sun, My God, oh my God, so the northerner says to himself he says: "this is punishment, it won't rain any more." Oh, oh, oh... He begs for March, which is the favorite month, of dear Saint Joseph My God, oh my God, But no rain comes, there's nothing more to do. This is a two-bit country Worthless little planet. The solar system is trash. Worthless little planet. Sub-planet! Sub-planet! The solar system is trash. It's a vision. It's a vision. It's all wrong. I see everything upside-down. It's all wrong. For six thousand years everything's been wrong, upside-down. Only now do I see six thousand years of hunger. It's all backwards. He is irreplaceable. There will never again be anyone like the Spider. Yes I had to work that scam. It was the only way out for millions of castaways. To fool hunger and the turning universe. Such is our tale a spider destroying itself in silence. Worthless little planet. Conceited litte planet. The solar system is trash. Worthless little planet. I'll kill myself yet. One day I'll kill myself. The woman is insane. What a lunatic, she's crazy, she's really gone. I believe those are the piercing cries of the goat. Ay, I'll kill myself. Hail Mary. Hail holy Queen, hail holy Queen. Hail holy Queen mother of God. Around a man who showed off his rotten teeth in a fan-like arrangement. The crowd closed in on him. In order to blow up the planet we need to sin twice as hard. We need to sin twice as much so the planet won't turn upside-down. We've got to. We need to sin twice as hard. We need to sin twice as much so the planet won't turn upside-down. We need to sin twice as much. Hail holy Queen, Hail holy Queen May Bongo, my great chief, not let me down. Summon all the spirits of evil. But I want nothing to do with God. I want the Devil. Hear us Eshu of Mud. All us Brazilians need the Devil. Evil is the way out. Grant us the special radiation of our mightiest friend caboclo do Mat?o, along with the Larib?ia, caboclo Arranca-toco, Guarani, Ceci and Diamantina. We need to sin twice as hard so the planet won't turn upside-down. Ay My Saint Lazarus. Help me. Ay what a stomach ache. Ay what a stomach ache. That afternoon, in a small burlesque theater in Assunci?n, she left home to kill herself. Attention. Extras, attention. One moment please. Would our friend kindly score a symphony for my act? I'm Pretty Joe, "wimmens' little peril". And I only come on with a drum roll. Where are the women? Pretty Joe without women is like Tarzan without Jane. Women good night, men, goodbye. Being handsome is a drag. Being hot is a drag. Women, notice the detail of my "womanistic" ennui Ay what cowardice. Ay what hunger. Pay attention to my hip. Being handsome is a drag. He is married I'm his mistress that lives like a zeal woman 'cose everything is missing at home. He is married Ay, I'm really hungry, I can't sing when I'm hungry, my throat goes hoarse. Why did you stop to eat that turkey breast? I was really hungry, my belly was hurting so much. I wonder if I can already return to Brazil. I can't bear this worthless little country any longer. Life just wears you out and one day you get desperate. I started when I was fifteen, now I'm twenty, this is all I know how to do in life. I adore you. You adore beating up on me. I'm going to live life. I'm going to get me an American tourist. You'll all starve to death. I'm through with show business. Over. Araci, Claudete, you suckers. You're suckers. I'm going to live life. Suckers. Suckers. The circus was packed. All the best people in the village were there, The happy ticket taker smiled, the crowd watched, the assistant sat up straight in his seat to enjoy the show. As the music started up, the clown received the cruel telegram. The poor astonished mute read the terse message which said that God had taken his poor old mother. The poor man stood in a corner. His eyes filled with tears, he wept waves of tears while the public shouted "Be a clown!" I recognize and identify the repressed male Brazilian. A product of the climate, the slavocratic economy and the inhuman morality that produce millions of desperate masturbators and pederasts. With this sun and these women! In order to uphold imperialism and the reactionary family I know the loose legs type. Capable of the worst and most hypocritical intentions on the streets of Brazil. Aghast, the poor mute read the paper which said that God had taken his poor old mother. Wretch stood in a corner, his eyes filled with tears, wept oceans of tears. And the public shouted "Be a clown!" Let him play!" The poor man leapt off his bench, for please the crowd he must, though he wept uncontrollably. Ah my poor dear mother, see this sad land of mine, I cannot even weep for you. Cursing in that dark chamber, the clown wept at his misfortune. The night was cold, my grief profound, my grief profound. Save me masters of the fire, save me the Eshu of Skulls, the Eshu of Mud, the Eshu of Tides, the Velvet Eshu. Not even the spirits pay me any mind anymore. I am a medium abandoned by his spirits. Give me a voucher for ten cruzeiros? Not even for coffee, not even for coffee. We shall return to Brazil in a week perhaps. When are we going back to Brazil? Maybe in a week. I am neither Catholic nor Brazilian. I don't understand the laws. I have no sense of morality. I'm a brute but I can still save myself. Love, Love. Why don't you surrender your soul to God, like me? I'm already there. This is the Devil. The Devil himself. Only the Devil plays Quimbanda. This morning I met the Devil playing pool, but he split... For the time being, this is the only way out for I wanted to be a woman, see? While you talk to God and go hungry. I talk directly to the Devil. Save me lord of fire, Eshu of the Tides, Eshu of Mud, Velvet Eshu. Skull Eshu. No one, no one, not even the spirits pay me any mind. Maybe, Maybe! I'm a medium abandoned by his own spirits, I already belong to the Devil. Only the Devil would be up for Quimbanda. I'll sell my soul to the Devil today, For the time being, this is the way out for Brazilians, I tried White magic, but now I'm going the way of darkness, the way of evil. Quimbanda is the same as Umbanda, only it uses evil. It uses evil I always had a feeling the Devil liked us. I made a pact with the Devil, he will show up at twelve o'clock. I always suspected the Devil liked us. What we need to do is leave this worthless continent. Go Spider, Spider, Spider, Spider, Spider. Spider, Spider... Woman, have you got any face powder? - I haven't got anything - Lipstick? Nothing. I'm leaving, I'm leaving. Why, woman? I'm tired of show business. Why, woman? I'm leaving, I'm leaving. He ate a sandwich and killed himself. He cut himself right in front of me and I couldn't do a thing. We're here. And where's Brazil? Where is it? On the other page? Brazil is out. Brazil must be off the page here. Off the page? SHIT FOR ALL We need to sin twice as hard so the world won't turn upside-down. Don't worry. I'll kill myself tomorrow. Everything, permanent. We need to sin twice as hard so the world won't turn upside-down. How about it, Spider? Anything today? Listen, bet a thousand cruzeiros on the nose. I have to play the alligator, put me down for one "conto". I want to bet on the alligator. Today I, today I have to win no matter what, see? I sure do. Eighty families and six hundred children. I've gotta win. I've gotta win. But of course I'm going to win. Yemanj? said I would win. Spider, what about the panhandling problem? What about the panhandling problem? Mass drowning. There are two words that ought to be expunged from of the dictionary. Two words that ought to be crossed out. Cancer and underdeveloped. She's a pretty young woman. Yemanj? Said I would win and I'm gonna win. This way Spider. Spider listen. Let's sleep together tonight? Let's sleep together, Spider? Let's sleep together? - I don't know. I'll think it over. - Look Spider. Look what I've got here. I've got some cash here. 500, what do you say, Spider? Spider? Are you game, Spider? I'll think about it, scram, I'll think about it, scram, yiiii the devil. Ay what a stomach ache. Ay what a stomach ache. Saint Lazarus. Saint Lazarus. Hail holy queen, hail holy queen. What are we doing here on earth? Out, out, out, out. What are we doing here on Earth? Out Ex? Caveira. You starving ghosts. Tell me how the deal went, the mulatta deal over in Africa. Girl, you wouldn't believe it. That was some story. So this gringo shows up wanting to hire a group of seven mulattas. And off I went. Here's the deal. I was a dancer and a cabaret artist. And I was making steady money, see? But since they said this would pay in dollars. We would be working for a chain of fancy European night clubs. So off we all go. But when we get there, it's a whole other story. We had to dance and to sing. The stuff we're used to. They want us to go out with the gringos during the show and get them tanked up. And at the end of the evening there's some other business that's not in the contract. So... you know me - I'm the suspicious type so I just split. But the whole deal was solid, I had to talk to some friends over there, some Portuguese politics I'd met over here, and they took care of things for me. As for the other girls, they're in a bad situation. Seems like there's some kind of technicality where, if they don't accept the stipulations in the contract, they get sent back on a cargo ship. And the boat, honey, you wouldn't believe what goes down on that boat We have to put up with that whole business, all kinds of madness on that ship. Spider, Spider, have you got something to eat? My Saint Lazarus. This is all I've got. Is it enough? May Yemanj? protect you. Thanks. Yemanj?. Yemanj?. Yemanj?. Spider, Spider, Spider. Yemanj?. My Saint Lazarus. Yemanj?. My stomach hurts. Spider, are you Catholic? I don't know. I stopped being a Catholic in order to become a Christian. I stopped believing in God God that I might believe in the resurrection of Lazarus. The Brazilian path is the path of evil. Ay what a stomach ache. I'm hungry. I'm hungry. Yemanj?. Yemanj?. I'm hungry. I'm hungry. Sleepwalkers and suckers of Brazil. Monkeys, monkey business. What is Brazil? What are Brazilians? Inside the favela, in the Spider mansion, the national bourgeoisie. The Spider, self-made financier, banker, political adviser and international figurehead. From the heart of the favela to the rest of Brazil. To be in a tight spot, just be entertained. Not funny; A denture-wearing bull wolf whistling at a cow in Bermuda shorts - that's funny The fate of humanity is horrifying. Some day she'll appear. No use making a prayer, yesterday I was coming back from the cheap dance hall, with my dear Cecilia, When they shouted, look at Padilha! But I didn't flinch, one day the upset pig, attacked me, and said, "you're the ninth, right"? "But I'm Francisco. I work like a slave and I'm a stower, I can prove it to you sir." Said the youth, wearing glasses in vain he gave me a chop on the neck. I fell to the ground on my face. Listen girl I need to talk to you. Meet me under that lettuce patch, ok? I wouldn't find it the least bit inconvenient if the world ended right now. Our time is without a doubt the worst of all times. This is no longer Brazil. We believed certain things would never happen here. The terrorist wants to transform Brazil into the anti-Brazil, and the Brazilian into an anti-Brazilian. There was a time when scoundrels had scruples. They did their dirty work far away from the others. Never to a Flamengo vs Fluminense soccer game audience. Nowadays scoundrels drop bombs all over the place. No one knows why, from one minute to the next, this favela became the final stop of the notorious long march of hunger. Every year two million wretches migrate from the interior to the favela. We don't know why all the wretched beggars and panhandlers in the country come here by the thousands. They multiply and become a public calamity. We must urgently create the national ministry of paupers and bankruptcy. No beggar ever became a millionaire. I have to go to United States, because I like the people of America, you understand? And now, well sing, we'll sing, we'll sing. I was invited to work in a film in Hollywood pretending to be your Captain Blood, and accepting the profitable proposal, I soon embarked, Captain Galloay and I, upon arriving there I was introduced to famous celebrities who said, this is a real artist, the one who did a film in Berlin sang samba in Beijing, and other novelties, I responded, this is arrogance, inspite of being the best in the style, not to gloat, I never was rich, I felt a bit stifled, I couldn't understand many words in "American," but I wanted to come off as Mr. Nice Guy, I spoke to Claudette Colbert, and someone called Clark Gable, Lon Shaney... I tap-danced with GoodBye, I did a film with Boris Karloff, Akim Tamiroff and with the small Sabu, who invited me to film in Hono Lulu, that's when I left because I can't ride an elephant. Hold it right there, honey. I'm flat broke. I'm hungry. Not with me. Trust me. - I'm hungry. - Not with me, honey. I'm hungry. I told you. Things are rough. It ain't gonna work with you and me. I am the Spider, I have 30 million at my disposal to teach Brazilians to read and write naturally with the disinterested support of foreign capital. I shall leave for Washington. I will transform the Amazon - I will transform the Amazon into a river lake. I will parcel off the state of Mato Grosso. I shall import the last good men on earth. I'm Omar, the Brazilian, son of God, the Brazilian. I'm worried about the Flamengo-Fluminense soccer game scores and about my own funeral. I'm hungry, I'm hungry, I'm hungry, What is this? Could it be that the Spider was a representative of the Western right? Favoring the annihilation of humanity through the bomb and hunger? No way, Spider. No way, Spider. Ay what a stomach ache. Ay I'm hungry, it hurts, it hurts. Understand, doctor, about the uproar that happened in my shack. In the morning I didn't wanna annoyace, she was anger and tore my jacket. I loose my temper, doctor. And there was a candlestick. I'm here in jail, and she is in the hospital. Understand, doctor, about the uproar that happened in my shack. In the morning I didn't wanna annoyace, she was anger and tore my jacket. I loose my temper, doctor. And there was a candlestick. I'm here in jail, and she is in the hospital. Once prosperous tourism has been reduced to almost nothing other scarecrows, the Spider's decision to hang a member of the opposition right in the middle of the airport didn't go down well at all. What little wealth is produced goes to secret Swiss bank accounts or foreign safety deposit boxes. Sugar exports are completely controlled controlled by the Haitian American Sugar Company. When I ran from the living room to the kitchen, the old lady came after me. Saying that I was cross-eyed, sir. A foolish woman. Nonsense, gossiping about someone just to be mean. And now they talk about me... There is no consumption because there are no consumers. Land belongs to the few, income to some. We've got this pension of forty million illiterates, with a per capita income just above that of Bolivia. Caged salaries, voiceless unions, penniless entrepreneurs. Bad credit and increased bankruptcy. Stupidity isn't a monopoly of any one group Least of all to Brazilians. My dear Brazilian millionaire, I ask you, shall you enter the kingdom of heaven? Being handsome is such a drag. I'm irresistible to women. I can't understand the revolt. No one ever rebelled here. Except to rob more. Terror isn't Brazilian. I'm so out of it I'd do anything to end cancer, hunger, fever, cold. Here in this republic everything is crooked, starting with the president's ranch, and to keep from starving I've already sold my soul to the Devil, but terror isn't Brazilian. Who are you? Good question. I came from the ends of the earth. I'm a child of the far beyond. My name is America. Wonder of the whole world. In the Spring of the year 1000 the earth stood still and no one paid any attention, the rich gave everything away to the poor, no one wanted anything, the churches stayed open day and night. I'm hungry. The day before the world ended was the only day that was any good. Ay what a stomach ache There are those that take a beating, urinate. The new Christ will appear in the final moments of the world. And who loose their life. He may be one of your children. That was a normal day for Sonia. It depends on Him alone. In three minutes she would be a pile of flesh, milk, hair and garbage. Starving ghosts. Leaning against the walls among rotted slats, - We need to sin twice as hard - mangled microphones, hard so the planet won't turn upside-down. Sweat and stench, chaos and garbage. Give me a drink. I have a stomach ache. To promptly investigate the biggest con artist in the Brazilian history, Osmar Peres Spider. He single-handedly controlled 80% of S?o Paulo automobile sales. A shark who ruled sixteen municipal districts and was involved in arms dealing with Egypt's King Farouk. Whose greatest invention simply consisted of selling, eight, nine or more times over, piece of land, automobile or be sitting room seven. After she spent 36 days prophesying, After she spent days and night prophesying. About several subjects. We need to sin twice as hard so the planet won't turn upside-down. Ay I'm so hungry! Shango told us to dance, he told us to dance. And have faith. Shango told us to dance. He told us to dance. Shango is the king of urubaba. Shango belongs to the stone quarry Shango is king of the heavenly bodies. Shango is the king of umbanda. Your children call upon you. Shango! Shango! Shango! She is a pretty girl. She is Yemanja's daugther. Ogum He came from Aruana. Hey, what happened? It was the death squad, they showed up and took away a couple, man and a woman. My God, what a calamity. He wins the battle to salve the daughter of the Umbanda. The Death squad showed up and took away the man and the woman. Ay I'm hungry. My belly aches. I'm so hungry. Ay what a stomach ache, what a stomach ache, what a stomach ache! I'm hungry, I'm starving. Ay what a stomach ache, what a stomach ache, I'm hungry. French kiss. I'm not sure you all understand we're experiencing an Anti-Brazilian moment. I don't know what's going to happen or where it'll all end! Come, you beautiful brunette, come to my arms, Come on, honey, come dance I want to see you swinging I want to see you sway I want to see you moving Until the sun comes up I want to see you moving Until the sun comes up Come, you beautiful brunette, come to my arms, Pensioners of all Brazil, I'm dreaming. This is a dream. I'm going to reform the Ten Commandments. Fix all this. Otherwise where will it all end? Where will it end? Where will this body take me? Where will this body take me? We are a dream that needs to be crushed. Your hot sniffs on my neck give me goose bumps It makes this old man feel young and all of a sudden my heart makes my blood boil. When I saw the land burning like the bonfire of Saint John I asked the God of heaven, why such torment! I asked the God of heaven, why such torment! We are alone in the name of everything. For our lack of luck and hunger during Carnaval, women stab one another in the middle of the street. They drown. They drink acid and arsenic. They tear open their veins. They refuse food. They throw themselves under steamrollers. They jump off Sugar Loaf. They hang themselves from fashionable garters, - and now comes the worst, Brazil and its destiny, Brazilians and their doubt.
