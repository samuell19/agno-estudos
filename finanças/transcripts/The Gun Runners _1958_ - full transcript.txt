- Hola señor. - Here you are Sam. You know what I'm going to do as soon as we get on board Sam? - You going to have yourself a beer. - Yeah, real cold one. I'll take that Sam, it's pretty heavy. Gracias, señor. - How is the day look Sam? - Couldn't be better. Yes it is, a pretty day alright. Well captain Martin. You Better put the ice on board Harv, before it melts. I'll just take the beer along too Sam, you know how Mr. Peterson is about warm beer. I can't do it, I'd like to do it as a favor but I told you last night I couldn't. - But you can name your own price. - It isn't that, I just can't do it. - So? - 2,000? Don't make me feel bad. I'm telling you the truth, I can't do it. Afterward, when things are changed, it would mean a good deal for you. I make my living with that boat. If I lose her, I lose my living. You're on the other side, maybe? I don't care who's president here, I can't carry anything to key west that can talk. - You mean we would talk? - I said anything that can talk. You know what lengua larga is? Sure, it's one with a long tongue. - You know what we do with him? - Quiet Carlos. You're not a lengua larga, are you? Don't be so tough so early in the morning, haven't even had my coffee yet. I'm sure you've cut plenty of people's throats. So you're sure I cut people's throats, eh? No and I don't care. Come on, Carlos. I'm very sorry, I wish you would take us. I'm sorry too. Even if I wanted to get mixed up in this mess, I couldn't. My boat is tied up. It's a man waiting for me to take him fishing. You. Cast off Harv. - What's the matter? - Fellow dragged in politics. - Get your clearance papers? - Yeah, I got them. - We ain't in any trouble, are we Sam? - Not us Harv. Can I get you something Mr. Peterson? Like beer maybe? I just had breakfast. Well, I haven't, so I'll have another beer and get me some sleep. I didn't sleep so good last night. - I got a strike. - Harv, wake up. Oh, I lost him. That's all right, he'll be back, he just hit the bait. Take the wheel, will you Harv? If it's all the same with you Sam... I'll take it in the cabin, I'm a little shaky on my pins today. All the good he is, why don't you throw him overboard? - He's my mate, he doesn't like water. - Some mate. - He was a good man with a boat once. - There he is. Knock him hard. Hit him half a dozen times. Ease up on the drag. Better ease up on the drag. Ease up on it. - I told you to ease up on it. - Pulled it right out of my hands. You shut down on the drag, I said ease up on it. Guess that's about enough for today. You know, we, we just unlucky this trip Sam, I... I've never seen anything like that in my life before. You, you ain't, you ain't plugged at me, are you? No, not at you Harv, grab yourself a beer. - You want one too Sam? - Not right now. - Peterson might want to celebrate. - You want a beer Mr. Peterson? - Head for Key West captain. - Where do you think I'm heading? Hey Sam, I want to see you Sam. Well, let's have the bad news. Ten days charter, you're in to me for $925. That includes the rod, reel and line from today. - The tackle should be your risk. - Not when you lose it that way. But the fish pulled it out of my hands. If you hire a car and drove it off a cliff, don't you think you have to pay for it? - Not if I was in it. - That's a pretty good one Mr. Peterson. You see it, don't you Sam? If he was in it, he would've got killed, so he wouldn't have to pay. And if he hung on to that rod and drowned, he wouldn't have to pay either but he didn't. So he's paying for it, I think I'm being reasonable. Well, I'll have to cash a check at the hotel. Meet me there at 6 o'clock, the Tropicana. No hard feelings now, are there? 6 o'clock then, I'll buy you a couple of drinks. 6 o'clock. He, he meant to both of us, didn't he Sam? You're my mate Harv. Work yourself up a thirst. Hey, I said I want to talk to you Sam. Come on already. Well, home is the sailor, home from the sea. - Hi Freddy. - What it be? Bottle on the cuff, if there's room on the cuff. Put the sailor's drink on my cuff, you broke sailor? I'll put it on your charge account Mr. Martin, will you take it with you or... shall I have it delivered to your yacht club? - Laugh it up Freddy, I got to get home. - So he's a big man. Why you run off for? - Who's running besides you Arnold? - I got a good reason for running. How about you paying your bill while you still got something left to pay it with? My charter didn't pay me yet, when he pays, I pay. It's as simple as that. - That's mighty simple, so when is that? - 6:00, you won't starve to death by then. Where at 6:00? I want to be there Sam. I've been carrying you for 3 months. I'm not the only one you carry. Yeah? The others don't hang around the back room at Pop's. Come on Sam, where at 6:00? You can't go to the Tropicana hotel looking like that, at least put on a clean shirt. And if you play your cards right, the lady might buy you a drink. Big man, in what yacht club? Lucy. - Lucy, I'm home. - I know. Then why aren't you at the front door waiting for me? - I'm looking for my nightgown. - You don't need a nightgown. A nightgown? This time of day? What you got to give? A style show? - Oh, I found it. - So hide it and come on out here. Oh, the faucet won't turn off, it drips. Now, that's mean, it's real mean. I'm counting three then I'm coming in after you. One... Two... Playing hard to get, eh? Where are the flowers? You always used to bring me flowers. - I was wooing you then, come here. - What's your hurry? Well, I'm a girl who likes to be wooed. - Start wooing. - What for? You're hooked. - Alright, stop wooing. - Come back here. What's that? Oh, it's just the front window. It keeps slipping. Hey, where you going? I have to fix it, don't I? Fix it, then I'll fix that leaky faucet. Sam? - You're right, the window slipped. - Sam, you come right back here. Have to go out in the shed and get my tools. Will you come here? Don't you want me to fix the faucet? Now who's playing mean? When I married you I married everything. You could've shaved, the whole side of my face feels raw. - You complaining? - No, only about my face. You didn't say anything about the trip. I had something better to talk about. - Anyway, you can have Mr. Peterson. - No, I don't want him. - I don't want anyone but you. - That's nice. - That's real nice. - Oh darling. Now stop it. There's a man waiting with a pocketful of money. Then you better leave some of it with Sy Phillips. If you don't catch up on your back payments, he's going to take your boat away. You know, it's a good thing Mr. Peterson came along when he did or you'd be boat-less. - And woman less? - No, that you'll never be. Hey Sam been paid yet? Say, you worried about Sam paying you Arnold? Why Sam ain't never gypped nobody in his whole life. Fine, so I'll make sure he don't break his record. I don't want wake up in the morning, find him and his boat gone and me holding the sack. You sure ain't a very good judge of character Arnold, let me tell you something. A man can't do wrong if it ain't in him to do it. And it ain't in Sam to do wrong and don't you forget it. Who wound you up? Now, it's different with you. Look at the way you pump gas. - You saying maybe I short weight people, eh? - Well, don't you? I got a notion to open you up and drain some of that cheap sherry out of you. Now, wait a minute. Ain't nobody calls me a wino and gets away with it. Nobody but Sam, that is and I... Oh hello Sam. You took a bath. - Must want your money real bad. - I do, where is it? - Peterson didn't check out, did he? - Of course he didn't check out. You know, we could be waiting in the bar. You got any money, Arnold? We'll pay you back. I don't drink and I don't gamble. Why don't we take our business somewhere else Sam? You a little late Mr. Peterson, you cash that check yet? A slight misunderstanding, over a couple of other checks. - But mister... - Sorry, we're taking to the police station. This guy owes me almost 1,000 dollars. You're not the only one he owes, he's been bouncing checks like they're ping pong balls. But I got to have that money. Oh well, come down to station and take your place in line, it'll be a long one. - Sorry about the rod captain. - Yeah. You should've held onto it. Buy Arnold a drink Harv, looks like he needs it. Well, I'll be seeing you, Arnold. Hello Sam. How come? You ought to be loaded. It's a sad story Pop, I'll spare you the details. I wish all my customers was as thoughtful of my feelings Sam. 20 dollars. Maybe I better tell you my story. Don't, don't Sam, when I'm sad the price goes down. 2, 4, 6, 8,10. 12, 14, 16, 18, 20. - I'll redeem that on my way out, I hope. - Good luck. Same sugar looking for a six. - Come on, six. - Three. With cold women, I always play the field. Seven, a loser. - Two shooter coming up. - Get me those dice, I feel lucky. Hey, watch out for this character, he wants to win. - Who doesn't? - Four, four is the number. Seven. Loser. Sam, let me talk you a minute. - I know what you're going to say Sy. - Sam, I don't like this at all. - I don't like it either Sy. - Come on, come on. - Let a real shooter have these dice. - No pass. Sam, you think it's right to gamble? You haven't made a payment on your boat in over three months now. 20 bucks I got for hocking a reel make you happy Sy? You haven't got the 20 bucks now. Sam, I'm going to have to take your boat. What would you do with it? You got a yard full of boats. The Lucy M is fast, I can find a buyer easy. That's right. - Kick a man when he's down. - Sy is not like that. Are you Sy? I don't want your boat, you know that but I've got bills to pay too. I'll wait but not much longer. What do you do? Besides, put your dough in the wrong places. - I take people fishing. - That sounds like fun. It is, you're lucky. And a five, again. Get your bets down, watch your hand. There's my luck, maybe I ought to try it some time. Yeah. - Hi you skipper. - Hi, there. - Say, how you make out last night? - Good, good. Like I always make out. I feel like fishing, what's the tariff? 75 a day, you pay for the bait and rods extra, also food and drink. - You're stealing. - Just a little. We're going to hit it off, my name is Hanagan. And skipper, I am an old sea dog who likes to eat and drink. You got plenty of salt horse and grog aboard? There'll be as soon as you put up a deposit. - Is that customary? - Yeah, in case your charter falls overboard. That do it? - Wake up Harv, we got a charter. - Yeah? Oh, that's fine Sam. Oh, that's just fine. For food, bait, beer and ice, come right back. - You, you said beer, didn't you Sam? - I also said food and bait, now get going. You, you didn't say wine, did you? One jug, keep the cork in till you get aboard. Ok, I'll, I'll be right back. - Do I pay for him too? - No, I throw him in. Eva. This Sam Martin, he's our skipper. This Eva Wahlstrom. Hello, fiskare.

Brownings, 30s and 50s, Thompsons, M1s, Reisings, you name them, we got them. - At what price? - It ain't wholesale. - Whatever it is Pepito, you must pay it. - Yeah, revolutions cost money.

But I'd be a lot happier if I knew what I was mixed up in. - Morning Mrs. Martin. - Morning Harvey, how are you? Oh, I didn't sleep so good. That's a good trip Sam, I had a fine time. - How do you forget her? - Just working. That's a good boy. I like him. Come on. - You supposed to be home waiting for me. - It got to be 11, so I got up. Oh, you're all salt and whiskers but you mine. - Save it. - What do you think I've been doing? Saving it. - Wow, what I'd give to look like her. - You've got your points. And this line means there's a tall, very extremely handsome man coming into your life. With glasses and he's wearing a Grey suede face and a yachting cap. Volly, you better hide your cup. - Ah, hi you captain. - And who's the dame? Something I found on the beach. Take a booth, will you? I don't want anyone to know I'm cheating on my wife. This a crummy place to take a lady. - Don't like it, pick up somebody else. - What, this early in the day? - No one worth picking up. - Who'd look at a bag like you? - You did. - So what is that prove? It proves that your wife must be a real witch. So she's a real witch, so I'm stuck with her. Now, you listen here Martin, your wife is a fine, upstanding young woman. How do you know? You've been trifling with her? What's trifling? Get in that booth over there and pull the curtain and I'll show you. - How much do I owe you? - Let's see, it's 48 bucks. Give the rest to Arnold for the gas, will you? Ah, your luck must've changed. What are you and the broad drinking? It's on the house. Hey toots, what are we drinking? How about some boilermaker sailor? And hurry them up, I want to be trifled. Boy, I wish I was a man. - I'll lay you 7 to 5 you don't make it. - What did you say? So that's what trifling is. Why didn't we meet sooner? If we had I'd be in jail for contributing to the delinquency of a minor. - I was a minor when you met me. - Were not, you were 12. Pardon me, folks. - Warm up the jukebox, will you Freddy? - Sure. You like trifling with me? And I always will. I just wanted to hear you say it. Oh. That dear dear face. You better like it because I'm stuck with it. - Haven't got much else. - You got a lot else. I was talking about the worldly goods I'm supposed to thee endow. You've endowed me with something a whole lot better. What? Love. You want some of it right now? After this dance, sailor boy. Let's get out of here. Hello Sam. Mrs. Martin. - Hi chief, what's up? - Commander Walsh wants to see you. - Why? - The commander will tell you. Can't you? That's the way the commander wants it, I'd come right down if I were you. I got a couple of things to finish first. - This dance and a boilermaker. - We'll wait for you in the station wagon. Something wrong? Maybe I missed a clearance somewhere, you know how the coast guard is. Well, don't let it be anything like, like real trouble. Oh, I'm in real trouble, you'd walk out on me, eh? If you were in real trouble, I wouldn't know where to walk to. Hi you cap. - How you doing Cass? - Pretty good, you? - Well, I'm trying, what's going on? - No idea. - Who's Walsh got in there? - Your mate. Maybe forgot to declare the load he's carrying. He wouldn't have to declare it, they could smell it a mile away. I don't see why you look after him Sam. He thinks he's looking after me. Oh hello Sam. Say, I'm sure glad you're here. - What, what they want with me? - What did they ask you? I mean, we weren't in Cuba, were we Sam? - When? - When? I don't know, I guess they meant this last charter. - Oh hi you Cass. - Hi Harv. - Were we Sam? - You know we weren't. Oh sure, I know we weren't. - Where did we go? - Straight out. Well then, why they ask me if we was in Cuba? I tell you, the way they run this government... I wish I could get to run, for one week, for just one little week. - It's all we'd need now. - Yeah, yeah, it's what we need. - Mr. Martin there? - Yes sir. - Send him in. - Mr. Martin. Oh Sam, you... you wouldn't have an extra four bits on you, would you? No hurry to get home. Oh, hi Sam, sit down. Lucy is waiting for me over Freddy's. - She doesn't like to drink alone. - Can't say the same about Harvey. He has to be a little confused, just where did you go? Straight out. On a boat or cloud or did you walk? Harvey wasn't sure. And he wasn't sure just who else was along. Harv is seldom sure about anything. - Who you take out Sam? - A sportsman and a blonde. Name of? A sportsman and a blonde don't give you their right names. That kind of a charter, eh? Just wanted to go straight out. They fished some. - Anything else you want to know commander? - Anything else I should know? Like what? A cabin cruiser went over to Cuba last night, put it at Puerto Bello. Puerto Bello is no place to take a sportsman and a blonde. It sure isn't these days. Unless they have business in Havana and don't want people asking questions. Lets my sportsman out, the only one to want ask him questions is his wife. So it wasn't your boat? - 37 foot colonial craft Lucy M, Key West? - Well, they didn't see it that close up. Next time you want to go fishing, commander, let's do it out in the Gulf. Ok Sam, sorry to drag you down here but two men were killed last night in Puerto Bello. One of them was a Cuban soldier. - Lucy. - Hi. Why didn't you wait? I said I wouldn't be long. All the fun went out of Freddy's with you. Alright, let's have it, good or bad? What's it all about? - What makes you think it's about anything? - Ah, your face is showing. - Come on, give. - Alright. A boat went over to Cuba last night. Two guys got killed, one was a Cuban soldier. Now you know why I was on the dock this morning. I could smell trouble. All night I could smell it and feel it. It came in on the wind off the Gulf. I didn't know about the killing until I heard it from the coast guard. - Do they know you went to Cuba? - I lied to them. Who'd believe the truth I had nothing to do with it? Don't press your luck Sam. You're my world, with a fence around it. From here on I look the bait over, make sure there's no hook in. Look close darling. You think I want to sleep alone? That's what they make you do in jail. Hi, fiskare. Oh, no. Just now I'm getting the smell of you two off my boat. It isn't that easy Sam. Why did you go to Cuba sweet? - You didn't have to. - I didn't notice anyone twisting your arm. - I needed the money. - So did I and Poppa needed a front. Who'd buy a man out fishing, suddenly wanting to go to Havana? But with me along... Nice front. - So, come on, I'll buy you a drink. - No thanks. Someone might come along and hire me for a day's fishing. You are hired. Oh, not by me, by Hanagan. He has another deal for you. - Who gets killed this time? - He didn't tell me. What else didn't he tell you sweet? - Such as? - What he's up to? Who's in with him? Maybe this time you better ask him before you take his money. He's waiting for you Sam, Tropicana, suite 1101. He lives high. - Too high for me. - How high could you live without your boat? Spell it out sweet. Poppa bought the paper on your boat from a man named Philips. He can take it away from you anytime he wants. I'm sorry. I really am sorry about the mess you're in, but you have to find your own way out. If you ever find it, let me know. Hey, hey Poppa isn't in that much of a hurry. You're smart to use that Sy, no chance of cutting your own throat. What's eating you? What do you think? My boat, you sold the paper on it. Well, sure I sold it, to a friend of yours, Hanagan. - Look, I thought I was doing you a favor. - Fine favor, you put me out of business. Now, call him up and tell him the deal is off. I can't do that Sam, it's too late., I took his money. You got this all wrong, he likes you. He told me himself how much he likes you. Yeah, he likes me. Sam, you're not sore at me, are you? You got this all wrong. Oh, hi Sam, what it'll be? What's the lady drinking? - Cuba libre. - Then give me a straight whiskey. May as well leave the bottle. - That's how it is, eh? - That's how it is. Well, everybody is got their trouble Sam. Now, you look at me. One Sunday morning I wake up, my wife looking at me, she says, I can't stand bald guys. That's the last I see of her, after 12 years. No woman in her right mind would be married to you for 12 years. - Do you got any knockout drops? - On her they don't work. - Make it a double baldy. - Coming up. Think you got troubles? You could be married to that. Now you cheered me up, I think I'll go home. Say, there's, there's a fellow Sam, a deputy, down at the boat. - Hello Freddy. - Hi you Harv. He, he's got a paper, he's waiting for you. Hey, don't go, dream man. I... Hey, you a friend of his? Yeah, you might say I'm the best friend he's got in the world. Oh, he's beautiful. I heard him called a lot of things, I never heard him called that. Well, who asked you? Now, where's that drink that I ordered? Well, it's right there, I just... Hey, you, come here, what do you? - Martin? - Yeah. Foreclosure. I'm sorry cap, I know how much a boat can mean to a guy but I got a job to do. I'll have to ask you for your keys. What are we going to do now Sam? I don't know Harv. But I'm not going to lose my boat. Hello Sam, I didn't even bother putting it in the window. Well, you can put it in the window now. Pop, I need $2,000. - For in there? - No, my boat. For 2,000 dollars you've come to the wrong place Sam. - You go to a bank for 2,000 dollars. - A bank wants security Pop. You've been burning yourself up keeping your boat ever since you got out of the Navy. It's dragging you down, just, just trying to hang on to her. - Howdy pop. - Hello. There ain't no money taking slobs fishing. - I like taking slobs fishing. - So maybe it's better you lose your boat. All I know is boats. I didn't come here for advice Pop, I need the money. All anybody ever gets from me over 100 dollars is advice... and and then they got to have something to pawn. - Without my boat, I'm nothing. - I'm sorry Sam. I'm not losing my boat Lucy. Alright, now if that's settled, let's get some sleep. - Where's Poppa? - Waiting for you. - You always have breakfast in bed? - As often as I can. And you'd be surprised how often I can. - About that paper on my boat. - How's the weather? Give me the phone and I'll call up the Coast Guard and find out. Ah, you already talked to them. Eva, get rid of this, will you? - Good girl. - Trained her yourself? No, this one came house broken. Don't you want to know what I said to the coast guard? You're here and I'm here, having breakfast in bed. I can fix that. And I would like if you do, then you never get your boat back. Sam honey, you keep your weight down. - How I keep my boat? - You do something for me. If it's Cuba, I've worn out my welcome and so have you. Yeah. You and I won't go ashore this trip and there won't be any shooting. - Just a pleasure trip. - Yeah. Then you get your boat back and 5 grand. You mighty generous this morning. It's not my money. You get the paper on your boat when we start and 5 grand when the job is finished. What you say? - Alright. - Good. Can you run the boat alone? I don't want that rummy mate of yours along on this trip. If it's that kind of a trip, neither do I. He's got enough troubles. Sure, I can run it alone. - How soon can you go out? - As soon as I get my keys back. I'll have to gas up and gas costs money. This ought take care of the gas. Tell me one thing... is there anyone you can't buy? They're in their graves, the ones you can't buy. For the right price, you can buy anybody, for anything. Some easier than others. How do you rate me Hanagan? Oh, you weren't so hard Sammy boy. - How does he rate you sweet? - About the same as you. That easy? - You go a lot unnecessary work. - It was all dusty. - Well? - I got her back. - Any strings? - Two or three. Hurry up, will you? I have to get my gear. - How long this time? - Three days. - So won't sleep much for three nights. - You sleep a lot more than if I were home. I'd sleep a lot better if you'd tell me what the strings are. Sam Sam... Arnold said you gassed up and you're shoving right off. How much bait should I get Sam? You know, we're going to catch a lot of fish this time... because I've been talking to people and I know where to go Sam. - How are you Mrs. Martin? - Getting ready to be lonely. - How are you Harvey? - Oh, I can't sleep, how much bait Sam? It's aboard Harv but we could use some heavy line to replace what that guy Peterson lost. Get some from Wilcox, will you? You want me to go all the way to Wilcox Sam? He's the only one who's got heavy line. Well, I thought you said we were shoving right off. No, no. No, there's plenty of time. Well, say, that's 20 dollars Sam. - You're in good shape today, you can count. - Stay that way Harvey. Oh, sure, sure Mrs. Martin, you know me. - Heavy line. - Yeah. I mean it Harvey. Alright Sam. - Alright what? - You know alright what. He'll get drunk and won't show up, that's what you want. Ok. Getting rid of him is one of the strings. People I'm taking out don't want him along. - Same people? - Same people. - Cuba again? - It's another one of the strings. Why they have to pick on you? - I had my hand out Lucy. - Can't you get out of it? You and your face. Get your gear. Last time you went to Cuba two men were killed. I want that face back Sam Martin. Sam. - Everything all right Sam boy? - Yeah, just making sure. Sam, this Carlos Contreras. Carlos and I've met. - Oh, small world. - And a funny one. - Finding you two in the same bed. - You're not in the same bed too? Yeah, sure, I'm in the same bed. You better jump aboard sweet. I'm not going Poppa doesn't need a front this time. And he's expecting bad weather. - Now what is that mean? - Happy voyage, fisherman. Thanks. The way you say it, I guess I'll need what's in that bottle. When they buy you for something, they buy you for everything. For luck. So long sweet. Same place? No, Boot Key. Only don't go in until after dark. We staying here? Just long enough to pick up a couple of guys and some ballast. - That's the word, isn't it? - Where we go then? - I tell you where when I get ready. - Ok, tell me when you ready. Sam... That no good rummy. - How did you get in that hatch? - I got to take care of you, I promised Lucy. Yeah, you taking care of me alright. I got to talk to you Sam, we're in trouble, ain't we? Don't make it any worse. You stay in there till I tell you to come out. Alright. Watch it, clumsy jerks. - Some ballast. - Where do we start? Come on, snap it up. Hey, we're turning around. What are you trying to do, eh? Pull something funny? What's going on here? - Take his gun, he scares me. - It's Ok, he checks the compass. You tell them why Carlos. We carry many guns, they changed the needles, so where north is, you can't tell. So, you go around and find out. Imagine an old sea dog like me not knowing that. Now leave him alone. - He knows what he's doing. - He better. When is somebody going to tell me the course? Yeah. Well, how about it Carlos? There's a little harbor, here, the fishermen use. - Gibara. - Gibara, eh? Gibara. - So what's the course? - The course you're on now. 225. It's for Havana. We go east, 126. How you learn so much about boats? Before I am a revolutionary, I was a fisherman. When this is over, I will be a fisherman again. When this is over, let's hope we'll both be fishermen again. What did you say Carlos? Carlos got curious. Start the motor. And after this don't stop unless I tell you to. Ballast was the right \word for what we're carrying. Guns are dangerous. Nobody gets killed this way. Nobody but us when we deliver these boxes of junk. We never intended to deliver them, they're just window dressing... to get Carlos to tell us where to meet the guy with the dough in gibara. What about Carlos, won't they ask questions? Oh, they won't get a chance. That's where you come in. When that boat pulls up alongside, you see that money handed over... You get us out of there, fast. Now, you're going to do it real fast, aren't you cappy? Because you know I'll be standing right behind you. Stop breathing down my neck, you make me nervous. Stop making' him nervous. Sammy my boy. Woody, make us up some sandwiches, and beer, peanut butter and jelly. Sam, for you? - Just a beer. - Just a beer. And wash your hands. Hanagan. Where he come from? - Get back in that hatch. - I told you not to bring him. He crossed me up and stayed sober. Get out of the way. - You're not killing my mate. - I said get out of the way. Look, he's a wino. Give him a jug, he won't bother anyone. Yeah, I know all about you. I know who you are and what you're doing. We'll shoot off his mouth the minute we get to Gibara. I tell you, you can trust him. He went to Puerto Bello with us, he didn't tell the coast guard a thing. He didn't know anything, he slept all the way to Puerto Bello. Yeah, that's right, I was asleep all the time. Sam, I don't wan to have to kill you too. Now, get out of the way. Kill him and nobody goes anywhere. You want to die too cappy? Who's going to take you across? None of you know how to run a boat, read a chart or set a compass. - You can do it, can't you? - Sure he can. He's an old salt. Go ahead, sing for them Mr. Hanagan. Put him in the hatch. And if he shows his face, blow his head off. Now, get in there. Now, stay in there unless you want your head blown off. - But Sam... - We're heading north for Andros Island. - When I cut the switches, go overboard. - Come on, let's get out of here. When they buy you for something, they buy you for everything. - How's that? - An old Swedish saying. What's wrong? Acts like some loose wiring, have to check the engine. This what you're looking for? Come on up out of there. Had to cross me, eh? Start the engines. Wino. Turn the boat around, we haven't got him yet. Turn around. I've known him many years, he's not going to get in place, even talk. Turn around. I can see him, he's over there. Keep going. There he is, I see him. Keep going, keep going. We're getting closer, a little closer and I can nail him. Ok, Ok, a few more yards and I can get him. Sam... Hey Sam... I'm, I'm here Sam. Hey Sam Sam... I, I'm here Sam. I'm, I'm right here, right here in front of you. Thanks, I got it Sam, I got it. Hey you, you all right Sam? Look what they done to you. - Hey, are you hurt bad Sam? - I'm all right Harv. You, you just get that wheel and head us back to Key West. Alright Sam, what, whatever you say. You, you just don't worry about a thing. I, I knew you couldn't do it Sam, I knew it, you know why? Because, like I told Arnold... a man can't go bad, if it ain't in him to go bad. And it ain't in you Sam... even if you tried to. Hey, you sure you all right? Just get me home to Lucy.
