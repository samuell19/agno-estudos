[English subtitles are available] How is it? Have you managed to dig it out? There are so many treasures. That's enough to get us another wife. -You... -My friend.

[Taoist Master] [Seventh month of the second year of Han'an Era, Eastern Han Dynasty] [Zhang Daoling, the founder of Zhengyi Dao,] [brought his disciple, Wang Chang, to Heming Mountain] Master Zhang, Heming Mountain is not far ahead. So close, so far. It's still far away. Wait up! Witchcraft is prevalent around here. Be careful not to fall under one. I know. Sir, His Majesty bestowed the title Grand Tutor and Marquis of Ji County, but you wouldn't accept it. But after receiving a letter from Lord Wen, you're travelling all the way to Shu State. The journey here is tough. Why put yourself through this? People are in trouble. How can I sit by and do nothing? -Sir. -My leg! Sir, what's the matter? Don't move! It hurts a lot! Both of you beat an old man up in the broad daylight. -I want to report it to the authority. -Sir. I'm so sorry. But we're in a hurry. How about this? Here's some... That's wise of you. Sir, he's obviously trying to con us. Don't move. Yours is even worse! The centre of your forehead is dark in colour. If you keep going down this road, you'll get yourselves in trouble. Sir. Thank you for telling us that. But this time, that's exactly why I am here. Chang, let's go. That old beggar is no ordinary man. Sir. That old geezer is either a lunatic or a swindler. Don't believe the thing he said. Don't judge a cover by its book. Kesulu. Yilimazaha. Haxikukajia. Sir. The weather keeps changing around here. Sir. Sir! Sir.! What is this place? -Come on! -Come on! -Come on! -Come on! Come on! Come on! Come on! Chang! Chang, wake up! Supreme Terraces of stars. Receive and transform without cease. Expel evil and restrain demons. Protect destiny and guard the body. Wisdom is bright and clear. The heart is at peace. Vanish! Vanish! Vanish! Wake up! -Chang. -Sir. You were under the romance spell. -What is this? -Don't touch it! That's a poisonous insect. It makes you hallucinate. It's full of miasmas and poisonous insects. We can't stay here. Let's get out of this place. Blood! Hurry! Bring it over! My Lord. You're running out of time. The ritual ceremony... will be held tomorrow night. If you exhaust your predestined lifespan... everything... will be too late. Have you gathered all the Ghostly Generals of Eight Sections? The host of the Heaven Amnesty is the only one left. That's because he has a skilled master to help him. It's hard to make him fall under the illusion spell. I'll set out at once... to take him down. It must be the sorcerer's doing. If it weren't for you, I would have been fooled by the illusion. That was the bedazzling hex. It's all because you have too much desire. That's why you would fall for it. Sir, didn't you always say that Tao models itself after nature? It's human nature to have emotions and desires. Indeed. But having too much of them would get you into trouble. Understood. Maintain one's heart unpolluted by materials, and one's mind undisturbed by activities. But, Master Zhang, don't you have desires? Sir, look! There's a tavern there. Sir. Hurry up. I'm starving. Sir, look. Finally, we don't have to spend the night in the open. Sir, hurry up! Master. Shopkeeper! Shopkeeper! -Sir, eat up. -Hope you won't mind. It's out in the wilderness. We don't have any nice to serve you. Help yourselves. You're a pretty lady. Why are you being a thief? I'm no thief. It's for an emergency! You're not the shop owner. -Where's the shop owner? -Behind you. Just some sleeping drugs. He'll wake up tomorrow morning. What did you slip into the noodles? Sleeping drugs too. He'll wake up in two hours. Release me. I have no intention to harm anyone. Chang. Chang! Chang! Chang! What have you done to him? Those were just some sleeping drugs. Chang. Why would he become like this? The same thing happened to my brother. It's the Poison Magic from venomous creature. He's much better now. You know medical skills too? I sealed some of the several important acupoints. That helps to ease his pain. It's exactly like my brother's condition then. It must be the doing of some evil Poison Magic experts. They are making a move again. How did your brother get poisoned? Half a year ago, he went into the city to sell the mountain products. He had a high fever when he came back that night. Then, fish-like scales grew on his skin. Where's your brother now? He's missing. I've been searching for him for half a year, but I found nothing. Thatâ€™s why I tried to raise money to hire more people to find him. Protect Chang! Ms. Hong Ying! -Are you all right? -I'm fine. You're awake. Here. I made you some medicine for internal injuries. Drink it first. I can do it on my own. You're badly injured. I'm afraid you're too weak to do it. Let me help you. Master Zhang. You have to help me. Before my brother went missing, these people in black once showed up too. They must have taken my brother. They are here for Chang. It looks like Chang and your brother have something in common. My Lord. Have you brought him here? The host of Heaven Amnesty... has a highly skilled martial artist by his side. Our men... are no match for him. A bunch of trash! You have one last chance. The ritual ceremony will start tomorrow. If you fail again, all of you will die! Where are we going? To visit an old friend. Perhaps we can get some clues. A foreigner like you have friends around here? Well, duh. Lord Wen, the Magistrate of Jiangzhou is my master's best friend. All right. Keep your voice down. Look at you. The Grand Sorcerer is performing the ritual! My child, are you all right? Hong! Don't take my son! All right now. Let's go. Sir, what's going on? The Grand Sorcerer is performing a ritual at the altar. The Grand Sorcerer? The only person deserving of the title is Gu Ma, the sorcerer. He's born with three eyes and possessed great power. He's the one who put a stop to the catastrophes all these years. -He's our guardian. -The Grand Sorcerer! -The Grand Sorcerer! -The Grand Sorcerer! -The Grand Sorcerer is awesome. -That's right. The Grand Sorcerer has turned them into food. It's just some deceptive illusions. That managed to fool these ignorant people. What did you say? Can you do it? Lady, can't you be more gentle? I'm a patient who's been poisoned. You might get infected. -Thank you, sir! -Thank you, sir! -Thank you, sir! -Thank you, sir! -Thank you, sir! -Thank you, sir! -Thank you, sir! -Thank you, sir! All of you ruined my ritual ceremony! You're a demon! Stop! -Thank you, sir! -Thank you, sir! -Are you all right? -What's the matter? -I'm fine. -Thank you, sir! -Master Gu Ma! -Master Gu Ma! Master Gu Ma, save my child! Those children have been missing for days. That's right. Even my son is missing! It's not just our kids. More than a dozen kids... are missing one after another in our village lately. My child! The Grand Sorcerer will find a way. Last year's ritual was poorly done and has offended the Mountain God. That's why the Mountain God is punishing you! Today is an auspicious day. In the evening, prepare a grand fire sacrifice. Make amends and seek forgiveness from the Mountain God. Those missing children... will surely return. -Thank you, sir! -Thank you, sir! -Thank you, sir! -Thank you, sir! Looks like I have to first... pay the Grand Sorcerer a visit. Sir. Someone with the surname Zhang requests to see you. -Let him in. -Yes. You are a precious guest who came from afar. I shall bow to you. I don't deserve it. I have long heard your good name. Hence, I pay you a visit. Please. You travel afar to this place. I wonder why. There is something... that I would like to ask you. Have you seen... this item before? I have never seen... this item before. Master Zhang! Wang Chang! Wang Chang! What's wrong, Wang Chang? Wang Chang, are you all right? Chang! Stand up! Your disciple has been poisoned with Poison Magic. Is there any way to get rid of it? I'm not specialised in Poison Magic. I'm sorry that I can do nothing about it. However... Please say it. Judging by his condition, I bet it's done by my junior, Wu Xian. He is an expert of Poison Magic. As he mingled with people who practised dark magic, he had violated the sect rules, and hence got punished by my master. He held grudges because of that, and killed our master eight years ago. He was chased out from the sect. Where is he? It's said that he always appears in the bamboo forest in the west of the town. You can push your luck. However, he is really good at running away. It's not easy... to catch him. I think something is wrong with the Grand Sorcerer. You have the same feeling too. The Grand Sorcerer doesn't appear like a kind person. The culprit who put the spell must be one of them. Let's go! We shall check out the bamboo forest in the west of the town. Sir! Wait for me. Master Zhang. Are you all right? I'm fine. Someone cast the Poison Magic on them. The wound... I'm fine. They are here for Chang. They purposely lured us here. We've been tricked by them. Who are you? I'm your saviour. During the ancient Shu period, the first Emperor of Shu, Can Cong, established the Kingdom of Shu and commanded the eight sections. The commanders of the eight sections were known as... "The Ghostly Generals of Eight Sections". That's none of my business. The Ghostly Generals of Eight Sections... were people with special fate. The first general... was born a righteous person. He made the best of people and never killed them. He was the most empathetic person. The second general was born a wise person. He was gifted. The third general was born a selfish person. He was the most stubborn person in the world. The fourth general... was born to be militant. The fifth general... was destined to be alone in his whole life. The sixth general was destined to live a good life. The seventh general was born with materialistic personality. The eighth general... was gifted a majestic life. He was free from worries for the whole life. A majestic life? Fate? Yes. It's you. Your fate... is exactly the same with... the General of the South. You... are the reincarnation of that General. No way. You are talking nonsense. Reincarnation is nonsense! I don't believe in that! No. You will believe it. No one... can defeat their inner... desire. Thank you for saving me. Ms. Hong Yin, you're most welcome. Those men in black... are vicious. You are no match for them. The weapon is poisoned with venom. I shall get some herbs. Sorry to have troubled... Master Zhang, we meet again! You have been following me in secret. Who are you? My name is Wu Xian. Wu Xian is me. Don't attack me. We are friends, not enemies. If you want to know the whereabouts of your disciple, come with me! Brother? Brother! Where have you been for the past six months? I have been looking for you! Brother, the Poison Magic in you... The Poison Magic has been cured. Brother, what had happened to you in the past six months? Hong Yin, I'm born to live a majestic life. I'm not supposed to live my life as an ordinary useless huntsman. Now... I have become the General of the North. I'm the commander of the Ghostly Generals of the Eight Sections. I will have the power to command all of sections in the future. Don't you feel happy for me? I... I feel happy for you. You will live a good life if you come with me. Hong Yin. We grew up together. I'm your only relative. For me, you are willing to do anything, right? Take this poison pill... and kill that Taoist master with it. Brother, I... If you don't do that... either he is killed... or I am killed. Mister! When are you going to stop? We have got to go far away to get rid of the stalker! Help, Master Zhang! Help! Turns out you get terrified at some points of life. What have you done? Well, I just gave you a mirror... for you to see your inner self. Is that the illusion witchcraft practised by you? Illusion witchcraft is done by making use of Poison Magic... to control your emotions, and release the demon side in you... so that your desire, fear and fragility... get heightened by hundreds and thousands time. Master Zhang. If I had intended to be malicious, I'm afraid... you would have been dead in the hallucination. How do I get rid of the hallucination? The only way to crack the hallucination... is to put down the demon in you... and to defeat the demon. Only then hallucination will not affect you in any way. Why are you helping me? As I said, we are friends, not enemies. Don't you... want to seek revenge for Lord Wen? Seek revenge? What happened to Lord Wen? It's a long story. Take a look at this letter. This letter... was written by Lord Wen before his demise. [Many people were killed under my ruling.] [What happened recently is appalling.] [Everything is closely associated with the Grand Sorcerer.] [He has become a threat to the locals.] [I intend to get rid of him.] [However, Rome...] [wasn't built in a day.] [It's a shame that I am powerless.] Lord Wen... wrote the same letter to me too. Murder cases occurred very frequently here. Lord Wen had been investigating about it. Most of the truth... was informed by me. I planned to collaborate with Lord Wen... to take down Gu Ma. However, it's too late. He was killed by the vicious. He was killed by Gu Ma? Yes. On the night Lord Wen was killed, I snuck into the mortuary. I saw it clearly. Lord Wen was killed... by the Lethal Soul Breaking Pill produced by our sect. Gu Ma is a wily old fox. I'm no match for him... not to say Lord Wen... who was just a feeble scholar. Gu Ma once set you up? Eight years ago, I was a respectable sorcerer, Wu Xian. Villagers who lived nearby the temple... always went missing when they were alone. Therefore, I conducted investigation in secret. I found out... it's closely related to my senior. I followed him in secret. Stop running! You can't outrun me. Gu Ma, my senior? Wu Xian, my junior. How could it be you? Where are the villagers? Look at this. What is this? Magical Tree of Fusang? Yes. This tree... is the habitat of the Three-legged Crow. It's the entrance leading to the Three Realms. Now... I'm going to revive the Magical Tree... to open the Heaven's gate. Therefore, I need sacrifices. In the past, the Kingdom of Shu... experienced natural catastrophes every year. The first Emperor, Can Cong, prayed to the Heaven together with all sorcerers. But at the moment... we don't suffer from disasters. Why are you doing so? The first three generations of Shu Emperors... lived more than 300 years. That's because they had access to the Heaven's gate. It's merely a legend. Even if it's real, you should sacrifice the Ghostly Generals of the Eight Sections instead. It has nothing to do with the innocent people! How would I know if I didn't give it a try? Perhaps we can work together... and live an immortal life. My dear senior. You couldn't be more wrong. If our master gets to know about this, he will chase you out of the sect. It seems... you are determined to go against my will. My dear senior. If you remain impenitent, I have no choice but to report to our master. Gu Ma is under the impression that I've died. I'm not destined to die! When I recovered from my wounds, I planned to tell the whole story to my master at once. But I've never thought that my master had died. Gu Ma framed me, saying I was the rebel who killed my master. From then on, my name was tarnished. I'm unwilling to carry this foul reputation. Moreover unwilling... to see my master die in vain. I've never thought that Gu Ma is so wicked. Seems like my disciple... must be the sacrifice that Gu Ma needs. You're right. Your disciple was born with the Heaven Amnesty fate. He shares the same fate as the General of the South. If I'm not wrong, on the lunar eclipse, Gu Ma will hold the ritual of... the Ghostly Generals of the Eight Sections. Then, bloods of the eight people will be fed to the Magical Tree of Fusang. Both of you are to blame. I tried to stop you from coming with all my might. But you came and caught yourselves in this mess. So, if we know the time and venue of the ritual, we'll be able to stop them. Will it be so simple? I'm still unable to find the secret venue. Gu Ma is cunning and scheming. He changes the venue frequently. It's extremely hidden. I have a plan to find the venue. It's suitable to move around at night. By then, I'll need your help. Master Zhang. You shouldn't let anyone know about tonight's plan. Especially that young girl with you. Look, Master Zhang. I've plucked some herbs and hunted a wild chicken. The weather's changing. Let's find a place to rest. Done. Thank you. Your injury... I'm fine. As hunters in this place, we've tasted a lot of herbs to cure plenty of ailments. Ms. Hong Ying. It's nothing. I'm reminded of my brother. Though we've tasted all kinds of herbs, but we can't cure his poison. Our parents died when we're young. We kept each other company. [We sang our hearts out in the mountains.] [We led a carefree huntsmen life.] We've never thought that one day, he'd suddenly got poisoned. I saw him writhing around in pain. He might as well be dead. My brother carved this sunflower for me. It faces the sun, facing hope. Ms. Hong Ying. I believe your brother and Chang... will return to us safely. I do hope so. The copper clang we saw that night... has the same patterns as Gu Ma's staff. He wanted us to look for clues in the bamboo forest. Alas... Chang disappeared. You're suspecting that Gu Ma caught Wang Chang and my brother? Do rest, Master Zhang. We'll investigate Gu Ma tomorrow. Hong Ying. You're flustered when you see me. I... I didn't. Did you do what I asked? I... How dare you defy my orders? I'll never harm him. Do you know what you're doing? You betray your own brother... for a stranger? You're not my brother. My brother will not beat me up, nor even force me to kill. How insolent! Brother! Please stop! We were so happy in the mountains. Follow me home, please? We'll hunt and carve together. Life will still go on. You don't know anything! I was born a general. How could I stay in the mountains with you... as a lowly huntsman? What's bad about being a huntsman? Using illegitimate ways to gain wealth makes someone a real scum! Shut up! Why are you so late? The ritual of the Ghostly Generals of the Eight Sections was planned for so long. I believe we can find some clues in the temple. I'll go in and have a look. I'll depend on you for backup later. Rest assured. I've scouted everything clearly. By sunset every day, the White Guards will change posts here. By this time, the Kun Gate at the south-west will have the lowest security. I'll be waiting out there. Remember. Gu Ma is a cunning old fox. Don't trust him. Master Zhang. Come and have a seat. Master Gu Ma. Why are you here alone in the grand hall? I've been waiting for you. Waiting for me? So, it seems... you're the one behind all this. Chang. What happened to you? Don't worry. I'll take you out to safety. Who's going with you? I'm the General of the South of the Ghostly Generals. I'm not your disciple. Gu Ma! What have you done to him? I merely gave him what you couldn't give. If you intend to take him away, tonight is your last chance. Kid. Come. Come. Don't be afraid. I'll take you home. I'm scared. Will there be monsters? There are no monsters in the world. It's all your illusion. Come! Catch him! Hurry! Catch him! Your turn to take action. Right here! -Catch him! -Right there! -Hurry! -Don't let him escape! Hurry! Here! Get him! Don't let him escape! -Get him! -Here! -Hurry! -Stop! Stop! Hurry! Corner him! Everyone stay calm and listen to me! Calm down! Listen to me! Folks! He's the demon who stole the children! Grab him! Grab that demon! Don't hurt the child! My child! Don't be afraid, my child. Mother's here. Look! This demon snatched my child! Please don't misunderstand. I saved this child from the Grand Sorcerer's secret chamber. Kill him! Stop it! Kill him! Stop it! Stop! Stop! Heavenly Lord. Please save us, Heavenly Lord. -Light the fire. -Hold up! Stop! Stop at once! Hurry and let these innocent people go! Or else I'll take you all back to the magistrate! Sir. Disasters are upon us! They are the sacrifices of the village for us to ask for forgiveness. Using lives to sacrifice? How absurd! Absurd? You interrupted our ritual. You are the demon! Folks! He is the demon! Yes! Demon! Light up the fire! Help! Stop! Stop now! Master Zhang. What a privilege for you to die at such a good night. Folks! You've prayed to the Mountain God. He sent all of you to the missing child. Burn this demon, and we'll be safe forever. Burn him! Master Gu Ma! Burn him! Master Gu Ma! I want to burn this demon myself! My two grandchildren... They were killed by him. I can't spare him! Master Gu Ma. Let me do it! I want to avenge my children! Good! Then I'll pass the honour to this old lady. May her grandchildren can rest in peace. Burn him! Burn him! Burn him! Burn him! Get them! Run! Get on the horse, Master Zhang! It's you! Go! Stop! Stop right there! Hurry! How can you ride slower than me? How are you? Just some external injuries. I'm fine. Wang Chang changed like a different person after Gu Ma captured him. Can the Poison Magic really affect someone's character? Normal venomous creatures trigger normal poison. But he was planted with one of the poisons, the hallucinating poison. The venom from this poison causes hallucination and hypnotises people. It enhances the host's desires to the extreme. It'll win over the host's heart and take over his mind. So, we must quickly get rid of that evil Gu Ma. So, my brother has the same poison? Yes. Your brother and Master Zhang's disciple are Gu Ma's chosen sacrifices. How can we remove the poison then? The only way is to kill the main venomous creature. The only one person who knows the whereabouts of the venomous creature... is the Humpbacked Witch. The Humpbacked Witch? Who is that? It's a detestable old woman. She claimed that she's from the royal of the ancient Shu. She's the one who taught Gu Ma the black art of worshipping for longevity. It makes my blood boil when I think of her. I underestimated him. I didn't expect that he would manage to escape. Anyway, just let him be. After tonight, he won't be able to find his disciple even if he comes again. Are you ready? Don't worry, Master Gu Ma. The ritual ceremony is starting now. It's said that whenever natural calamity occurred in the past, Can Cong, who's from the Kingdom of Shu, would lead all the sorcerers... to worship with bronze tree. The Ghostly Generals of the Eight Sections... willingly became the oblation. On the day of lunar eclipse, after opening the Heaven's gate, Can Cong gained a 300-year lifespan. It's just a legend. It's just a lie. Darn it. So, he used the hallucinating poison... to create the Ghostly Generals of the Eight Sections. That old man put in so much effort... to find eight people who have similar fate to the Ghostly Generals. He placed eight types of hallucinating poison at eight directions respectively. Once the toxin of hallucinating poison enters human's blood vessel, it will make one be in a confused state of mind. If it enters viscera, it will make one lose his nature. Once it goes into heart, even if the main venomous creature is found, one will still be in a life-threatening condition. Gu Ma, that evil old man. He planned it for so many years... and finally gathered the Ghostly Generals of the Eight Sections. He definitely can't wait to hold the ritual ceremony. Where is the altar? The position of the altar... needs to be determined based on certain diagram. The hexagram of the diagram... could determine... the time and position of offering the Ghostly Generals of the Eight Sections. Unfortunately, I've never seen that diagram. I found this diagram in the cave under the temple. Perhaps we can get some clues about the time and position. The venue of the ritual ceremony... should be in the direction of Shengmen on this Bagua. But where is Shengmen? We need to reckon according to the time of the ritual ceremony. That means, if there's a change in the time of the ritual ceremony, the venue will change too. So, what's the time? Tonight. Gu Ma will hold the ritual ceremony tonight. How did you know that? He set up a trap... and thought that I would be dead for sure. When he got overexcited, he made a slip of the lip. You have the last chance tonight. It's your honour to be able to die on such an auspicious day. There will be lunar eclipse tonight. Oh no! By my reckoning, the ritual ceremony will begin within an hour! We need to figure out the venue soon. Kun's broken into six, south-west of all directions. Overturned bowl, the north-east, Qishan. Xun's broken into five, the south-east is windless. Xun in the east, Dui in the west, Li in the south, Kan in the north. The position of lunar eclipse is in the south-east. Is there a mountain with extreme yin in the north-west? Yes, Yingxiang Peak in the north-west! Hurry up! Let's go. It's time. My Lord, please. Kesulu. Yilimazaha. Haxikukajia. Dear warriors, it's time for you to make offerings now! Kesulu. Yilimazaha. Haxikukajia. The Heaven's gate is going to open. Hurry up. Faster! Haxikukajia. Kesulu. Yilimazaha. Haxikukajia. Stop! It's you again. It seems like you have a death wish. All right. Someone, kill him for me! Kukada! Kesulu. Yilimazaha. Haxikukajia. Kesulu. Yilimazaha. Haxikukajia. Kesulu. Yilimazaha. Haxikukajia. Kesulu. Yilimazaha. Haxikukajia. Help! Help! Help! Help! Tell me. Tell me! How can I save you? Kesulu. Yilimazaha. Haxikukajia. Kesulu. Yilimazaha. Haxikukajia. Kesulu. Yilimazaha. Haxikukajia. Kesulu. Yilimazaha. Haxikukajia. Kesulu. Yilimazaha. Haxikukajia. Kesulu. Yilimazaha. Haxikukajia. Kesulu. Yilimazaha. Haxikukajia. There's only the last step left. As long as the Heaven's gate is opened, we will gain eternal life! Kukajia. Kukajia. Brother, don't do that! Quickly seal the both Yingxiang meridians! Congratulations, my Lord! The Heaven's gate is opened! Evil thoughts come when you get carried away, evil thoughts go when you have a calm mind. Master Zhang, you have been practising Taoism for so many years, can't you even comprehend such a simple truth? Wake up now! I can't save them. I have been practising Taoism for so many years, but I still can't save them! Yes, you can't save them. But you can find the source of evil... and wipe out the demon who causes all of this. Come. You want to gain eternal life by using such scrap metal? What a joke! Turtle Crone, where are you off to? Hand me the main venomous creature! You want to know the strength of my leg? Let me tire you out! You evil witch, get up and continue our fight. I haven't had enough fun. I've got the venomous creature. The venomous creature should be inside this turtle shell. How to open it? Master Zhang must know the way. Break! Zhang Daoling, since you don't want to spare my life, let's die together then! Let's check on the two of them. I've got the venomous creature! I've got the venomous creature! It's inside this turtle shell. I've got the venomous creature! The venomous creature is inside this turtle shell. Master Zhang, think of way to open it. Comes the Wood from the east. Comes the Fire from the south. Open. It turns out that the venomous creature is a toad. What should we do now? Don't worry since we've got this. Leave it to me. Are you going to escape? Snake, centipede... and the most poisonous one. Done. It's done! It's done. Will it work? Yes, the taste is almost the same. Try it and you will know if it works or not. Brother. Hong Ying. Master Zhang killed the evil Gu Ma for us. He is our benefactor. Sir, I'm weak-minded. I am so ashamed of myself. A fall into a pit, a gain in your wit. I'm glad that you're fine now. Watch out! Hong Ying. Ms. Hong Ying. You... protected me all the time. I... But I almost harmed you. It's my turn to protect you now. Brother. Hong Ying. I... I wish... I wish to... return to... the mountain... with you. Brother. Hong Ying. Hong Ying. Hong Ying! Hong Ying! Hong Ying! Help! Please help us! Help! Please help us! Help me! Help! Everyone, you can go home now! Thank you, our saviour! Get up now. Everyone, please get up now. Get up now. Everyone, please get up. Hurry, get up now. Thank you, our saviour. After this battle, the sorcerer sect has earned a bad reputation. Anyway, as long as the people are all living in peace, I'm willing to risk everything. There's no a good or bad sect, but thinking makes it so. Master Zhang, where are we going? Return to Mount Longhu. All right! Master Zhang, could you let me tag along? Come on! Wait for me! [In the seventh month of the second year of Han'an Era,] [Celestial Master Zhang went up to Mount Qingcheng...] [to meet the Ghostly Generals of the Eight Sections...] [and had beaten up all the demons.] [He subdued the demons and wiped out the evil.] [With deep understanding of Taoism,] [the demons were all subdued by him as they're no match for him...] [and willing to switch to the right path.] [Therefore, Master Zhang led nature spirits from all directions...] [to take oath before the Huangdi's altar, located at Mount Qingcheng.] [Humans stay in the world, while ghosts stay in the underworld.] [It also made the demon king be confined in Fengdu City.] [The Ghostly Generals were banished to the borderland of Western Regions.] [Henceforth, the people live in peace as the demons were subdued.] Mister. What's the last drug that awakened us? -You want to know it? -Yes. Don't run! You need to eat this! That's too disgusting! [Hope we have a smooth shooting!]
