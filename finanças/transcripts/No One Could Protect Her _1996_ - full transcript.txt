[narrator reading] [mellow music playing] [cycle chain whirring] [mysterious music playing] Morning, Mr. Chapin. Busy day, Jessica. No time to lie in bed. Man, you are early. [birds chirping] [Jessica] Oh-ho. [Dan] Oh-ho. I know you'’re not really asleep. Yes, I am. We have to be at the office in ten minutes.[singing] I'’m taking a sick day. Tell the boss I'’ve got malaria. I'’m the boss and so are you. Mmm, I keep forgetting whose idea was to start this business anyway? My love, today is Thursday. What starts tomorrow? Oh, yes! [whispers] Ten days with no phones, -no faxes, no beepers. -[Jessica] No faxes, no beepers. I promise. You promise it won'’t be fives years before our next vacation. You'’re sorry you married a working man? Absolutely. I'’m getting dressed. [ominous music playing] [motor whirring] [tires screeching] [radio chatter] Shouldn'’t you be back at the office doing paper work? Well I heard the call. I was passing by. Do you mind? Not at all. I can always use the voice of experience. Right? Listen, I when we got married I said I'’d stay out of you cases but-- [Beth] Her name is Catharine Dobson. She'’s been missing about three hours. Doesn'’t look like she met a friend. Does it? Morning shift should be in by now. Maybe they can... dispatch can pull some bodies for... house to house. [indistinct conversation] [Michael] Hey, Corning. Good morning, Michael. [car sputtering] [suspenseful music playing] [Beth] Greg, what do you have? Sergeant Meyer, call dispatch. Tell them to pull everyone they can get them down here. [Greg] Juvi, vice, everyone. I want a grid search of the entire neighborhood. Tell them first uh, I want to talk the old lady'’s kids, whoever. And I need a sector map now. [Meyer] You think someone'’s got her? Let'’s just get moving all right? [Dan] Tammy, get me Stevens to Chicago. Jack'’s got a flat tire. Thanks. Hey, Bob, do you think in between bites on that donut, you can let me know when Sid gets here? Mr. Lowenstein asked for him specifically. Yes, boss. Hey, buddy, you look a little stressed. I don'’t believe in stress. [laughs] Weekly numbers are all down, we didn'’t even lose that much money. Frank, you'’re a prince. You know it. [Beth] It'’s been six hours. Where would he take her? To his house? [Greg] If it'’s close. [Beth] He'’s not gonna want go too far with her in the car. -Right? -Hm-mm. [Beth] If not home, some place close, some place private. The river. [Beth] Now it'’s got lots of woods up there, it'’s pretty thick this time of the year. Nice and private. [indistinct chattering] [suspenseful music playing] We need twice as many men to cover this area. [yells] Detectives, we got blood here. Took two steps and there it was. There'’s no trail. Just a few drops. Is it human? [Greg] Spend all afternoon for an injured rabbit. Sergeant, let'’s focus the search here. Line them up along this path. And then walk them straight back into the woods. We'’re running out of time. [Meyer] [yells] Fall in. Fall in [Beth] I want everyone in a straight line. Fan out 20 meters on either side of me. Okay? [Meyer] Come on spread out, spread out. So that I don'’t want you to miss anything, all right? You can take it over here, straight back. [eerie music playing] Beth. She'’s right here. [intense music playing] [sighs] She was stabbed and strangled. I can'’t say yet which killed her. And it looks as if she was raped as well. [sighs] Thanks, Ryle. Call me when you know, all right? [Beth]Sixteen years old. Let'’s go tell the parents. No, I'’ll do that. You stay here and get on this thing. All right? Come on. Let'’s get to work. Well, Mr. Hardaway, you are very welcome. You work hard. You just seem like a man who needed some base ball tickets. [giggles] No, thank you, Mr. Hardaway. -Did he enjoy the game? -You bet. And next month 75 visiting insurance brokers will be riding a Rayner Limousines. You are so lucky you have me. -A shameless manipulator. -[chuckles] It'’s five o'clock. I have message from the office staff. [yells playfully] Get out of here. Nice respect from our employees. We should fire them. You can'’t fire me, I've known you since you were three. Oh, I have to call Ron Baker at the bank. -Crises is at seven we keep looking at. -I'’ll take care of it. I got Jack stuck in Chicago. [clapping] -Mr. Wolenstine... -Out. [indistinct chatter and clapping] You'’re gonna take care of it. [woman] I'’ll be thinking about you. -[girl] Jessica. -Hey, how'’re you doing? Jessica, we were catching caterpillar. Oh, that sounds like fun. So we almost missed you. Trying to kick '’em out. Hey, Jessica, can I see inside the limousines? Sure you can, sweetheart. Come with me. So you'’ll bring in the mail while we'’re gone? Yeah, no problem. I just came by to get the keys. [Jessica] Oh, they'’re in there honey. Did you hear about Katie Dobson? Someone killed her. They found her body at the river this morning. Do they know who did it? No idea. That'’s what makes it so scary. [Jessica] Oh, God. Went to school with her mom. Well, you guys picked a good time to go out of town. Yeah. Got to go, have fun. [pleasant music playing] [fish-line whipping] I'’m never gonna get this. Yeah, it'’s beautiful. I guess it doesn'’t matter if I catch it. [spring winding] [chuckles] It'’s suppose to be fun, remember. You'’re doing great. [laughs] Did I get you? Are you okay? Okay. I'’m the fish you want to catch? [Jessica] I can hook off now. [Dan] I can untangle. Hold on a second. [Jessica] I need your help. [fire rustling] [Jessica sighs] -Water is delicious. -Yeah? Listen, [clearing throat] this is almost ready. So we should think about getting changed. Okay. [mellow music playing] [moaning] [mellow piano playing] Wanna help? [chuckles] [crickets chirping] [Dan] I'’m not gonna go if you'’re gonna go. Right. Like my fish dinner was interrupted if you... -Carol forgot to lock the door. -Oh. You sister is not doing the job very well. -We'’re gonna have to cut her salary. -[Jessica laughing] Hey, Carol, you here? -I'’ll call her. -Go ahead. [Dan sighing in exhaustion] -[Dan] You'’re cooking. -[Jessica chuckles] Hi, we'’re home. Oh, it was amazing. Just perfect. No. [chuckles] Listen, did you happen to leave the door unlocked? Carol said she'’s positive she locked up and she'’s pretty good about things like... that. Please tell me you did this. [Jessica] Oh, couple of CDs, what else? Oh, bottle of scotch. Can you believe that? Jess, I am so sorry. -I could have sworn I locked the door. -No. Carol, sergeant Meyer'’s said, he came in through this window, and out through the front door. I was supposed to watch the house. Oh, forget it. He hardly took anything anyway. It'’s just weird. Weird is right. It'’s almost like he just wanted to go through your things. I'’m sure he was very bored. Okay. Everything upstairs is fine. Do you have every thing you need, sergeant? Yes, sir, Mr. Rayner. [sighing] I'’ll put everything out in the wire but truthfully I wouldn'’t be too optimistic. You know, could have been teenagers. If you'’re gonna keep the windows open, you might wanna look into getting an alarm. Yeah, okay, we'’ll think about it. Thank you, sergeant. [door closes] That'’s wonderful. [Dan] Somebody robs your home, and the police say, get an alarm. Just wonderful. I do have to say this guy was very tidy. Little piles of clothes, screen placed neatly on the chair. Your kind of burglar. I'’m going to St. Louis with Frank tomorrow night for that meeting. I think you should stay at Carols. Absolutely. -I think it'’s a good idea. -Dan, Dan, Dan, no. She lives right up the street, it'’ll take four seconds to get here. Okay? Now let'’s talk about dinner. I'’m starving. Let me help. What did you mean my kind of burglar? [indistinct chattering] I think I'’ll be heading out to meet with Sandy at five about buying those stretch limos. Don'’t just talk numbers with Sandy. We'’ll get a better deal if he likes you. Well I'’ll sweep him off his feet and be home by midnight. -Okay. -Stretch limos, can you believe it? Two tycoons. That'’s us. Look, honey, I know you and Frank love those river boats so if you wanna stay overnight and gamble... that'’s fine, okay? -Stay and gamble? Never crossed my mind. -[chuckles] Hey, you ready to lose some money? This was supposed to be a business trip, remember? Oh, yeah. What'’s it gonna be, cracks or blackjack? See you tomorrow. Have fun. [crickets chirping] [ominous music playing] [door clicks open] [door creaking] You'’re back? [ominous music continues] Dan? Honey? Dan? Is that you? [enthralling music playing] [floorboard creaking] [groans] [snarls] [Jessica] [screaming] Mr. Chapin! Mr. Chapin! [groans] [dog barking] [straining] [whimpering] [groaning] [muffled cry] No, no, no. [crying] No, no, no... [gasping] [struggling] [burglar] Fuck her! [thud] [eerie music playing] [choking] [breathing heavily] [muffled cry] You are beautiful. You, are so beautiful. [gasps] [Mr. Chapin] Jessica? [breathing heavily] Jessica. [exclaiming in horror] Mr. Chapin. [mumbles] Mr. Chapin... [mumbling tearfully] [woman over PA system] Where is she? Where'’s my wife? -Mr. Rayner? -Yeah. -I'’m sorry. -Is it bad? Is she alive? She'’s alive. Mr. Rayner is you could just take a minute, please. -Look, I want to see her. -I'’m sorry, you can't. -What do mean... -Sir, your wife has been assaulted. I'’m here to make sure she remains safe. Now go to the waiting area, Mr. Rayner! -Please, I can'’t please. -Let him go. [Frank] Go see her. Go see Jessica. He'’s sorry. Okay? He'’s sorry. Let me get you a cup of coffee. [somber music playing] Jessie? [Jessica] How was St. Louis? Did you win? What happened? Someone came into the house. I was asleep. I thought it was you. [sobbing] I thought it was you. [mumbles tearfully] [shushing] It'’s okay. It'’s okay. [indistinct chattering] Greg Corning. How are you? I haven'’t seen you in years. Hi, Frank, I'’m fine. Little over-worked. Anything you can do to to help these people out, I'’d appreciate it. They'’re my family. I'’ll make it as easy as possible. -Is she up for answering some questions? -Yeah. You should go in. Dan? Danny? Come on, buddy. And I went to bed about 11:00. All right. About the attack... this one thing I have to ask you straight away. Were you sexually assaulted? What? We should do a rape kit as soon as possible. I don'’t know I was kind of out of it. She would remember if that happened. She did get a pretty good knock in the head. She would remember something like that. You don'’t need a rape kit. Dan I... [hesitatingly] I think it'’s a good idea. [camera flash clicks] This won'’t be much longer now, Jessica. Just breath for me. Take a deep breath. -Okay. -Just one more. It'’s almost done. [Carol] Just hang in there. Good. Jessica, get dressed now. [Jessica] Brownish hair, baggy eyes weak chin. He was taller than me. 5'’10" maybe. He had rough skin. And he smelled. You have a good eye, Jessica. You should have been a detective. [chuckles] Maybe in my next life. Hmm. Okay, let'’s just go over this again from the beginning. [Greg] You had dinner-- You know this is totally ridiculous, okay. She'’s been over it three times already. Why aren'’t you out there looking for this guy? -Dan... -Maybe you should wait outside, Dan. So that you can waste some more time? No. No, I think not. All right, detective, time is over. [door shuts] I'’m almost finished, doc. Great. Did I ask you a question? [doctor] She needs sleep now go, get. [doctor chuckles] You'’re the doc. I'’ll see you tomorrow, Jessie. [doctor] Well your x-rays came back negative. That'’s a hard little noggin you'’ve got up there. [both laugh] Let me take a peak. [door slams] Dan, he'’s just doing his job. [doctor] And that looks perfect. [sighs] Now. I'’m gonna give you something to help you sleep. And Dan here is going to go across the street to Curlies diner and get himself something to eat besides coffee. I recommend the meat loaf sandwich but then that'’s up to him. I'’ll be right outside. I promise. [door clicks open] [sighs] Sent Carol home. She'’s exhausted. How is Jessica? She'’s in the hospital, Frank. She was raped. How do you think she is? Greg said, she gave a great description. The jerk cop wouldn'’t leave her alone. She'’s exhausted. Can'’t he tell that? You want a cup of coffee? No, I don'’t want a cup of coffee. Yeah, yeah, look I'’ll get it. [woman over PA system] [exhales] Glad she'’s okay, Dan. Well, if it isn'’t Sam Spade. [sarcastically] You just can'’t seem to leave. I guess you'’re convinced that this guy is some where in the hospital. Is that it? Maybe he is. There'’s few questions I wanted to ask you. [Dan sighs] I told you, I don'’t know anybody who'’d do something like this. Mm-hm. [vending machine pops] You were in St. Louis the whole night. That'’s what you said, right? What are you getting at? You think I did this? To my own wife? People do it everyday, Dan. Even worse than this. [woman over PA system] -Where you going? -I'’m gonna find this guy. What are you talking about? Do you know who he is? No, but I know what he looks like. You know what the police know. They'’re already looking. I'’m afraid the police don'’t know squat Frank. I know this town and I'’m gonna find him. All right. [Jessica] Dan? [gulps] Where'’s Dan? Where'’s my husband? Honey, you should try to get some sleep. But where is he? I need to see him. He'’ll be back. Now. [shushing] Try to sleep. [door slams] [man] What is your problem? [Dan] You'’re my problem. -[scrambling] -[Frank] Dan! [bottles clanging] [breathing heavily] You know every weasel in this town. Now you tell me what you heard. I haven'’t heard anything. What are you talking about? Dan! You should be locked up, you know that? His wife was raped last night. I want to know who did this! Come on, Dan. Let'’s go home. Come on. Come on, get in the car. [groaning] [mumbling] [groaning] [exhales] Who are these people? They'’re installing the alarm. [indistinct chattering] [hammer banging] [exhales] Hey, Bill. Hey, Mr. Rayner. Mrs. Rayner, my boys will be out of your way in a few minutes. -Show you how it works? -Sure. It'’s all pretty simple. You'’ve got your security code, areas of coverage... This indicates the zones, doors, window. Now, if there'’s someone in the house-- [clears throat] Can we... Can we please do this later? Sure, sure. Why don'’t you sit and get ready for bed. Jess, you should sleep much better now. Excuse me. [metal clanging] Well, you stay safe. Thank, bro. [exhales] [crickets chirping] Dan? [footsteps approaching] Dan? Every thing is set, honey. The alarm is on. Go on to sleep, you'’re safe. Aren'’t you coming? I don'’t want you to worry, all right? I just thought I'’d keep an eye on things. You go on to sleep. Go ahead. [somber music playing] [bed spring creaking] There'’s no such thing as too much food. We need to get your strength back with ice-creams and cookies. Oh, shut up and pamper yourself for a change. I'’m gonna pamper myself right up 300 pounds. Dan would love that. He'’s so relieved you're okay. He doesn'’t care how many cookies you eat. [snickers] No, Carol, it'’s been so... awkward. He hasn'’t... he hasn'’t been affectionate. He... can hardly look at me. Well, it'’s gonna take some time. It can'’t be easy. Yeah, it'’s like some damaged goods. Don'’t say that. He doesn'’t think that way. Don'’t even joke about that. Can you drop me at the police station? What police? They have to do the sketch this afternoon. Guess they want you to do it while you still remember. I can wait ten years. I will never forget. He just kept smiling the whole time. Sometimes I think he liked it so much he wants to come back. That'’s not gonna happen. He knows the police are looking for him everywhere. He'’s a million miles away by now. I guarantee it. I'’ll take the cart back. [suspenseful music playing] Jess? [Jessica] Another one. Oh, my god. [indistinct chattering] Cheek bones were... sharper, higher. You'’re good. Most people come in here and they say, "he was tall." Okay. How does it look? It'’s him. Still in with the artist, huh? Detective, I called you this morning. Well, I knew you'’d be coming in today and I thought it would be a better use of time. When I call you, you drop your donut and pick up your phone. Wanna know what I did this morning, Dan? Yeah, I want to know what did you do this morning. Got in at 6:00 am, and I spent five hours looking at tread templates trying to find a match for that sneaker footprint in your walk way. This isn'’t going fast enough for me either, but things take time. And there'’s nothing... nothing I can do about that. Detective. You know about this. Thank you. [clearing throat] Sara MacMillan. My sister is a friend of the family and she saw the police cars there this morning. I'’m sure it's the same man who attacked me. The same man who attacked Katie Dobson. They'’re kids, Jessica. But it'’s all in our neighborhood. We'’re working that angle but believe me, I'’ve been on the force a long time and I'’ve seen a few cases like this. Now this kind of criminal, they have a very specific victim profile. And you and this kid and Katie Dobson they couldn'’t be more different than-- It'’s him. I know it. Well, we won'’t ignore any possibility. But right now I'’d like to get the sketch to the deputy chief and get it out to the Illinois state police. We'’ll check it out, Dan, but it isn'’t the same man. I don'’t know who this guy is. But can'’t you see what'’s happening? I mean she'’s getting worse. You got to catch this guy fast. Please. We'’re trying. But what your wife'’s going through is completely normal. None of it is normal. None of it. Just wait here, Mr. and Mrs. MacMillan. -I'’ll get a car to take you home. -Thank you. [indistinct chattering] I am sorry. You'’re the MacMillans, aren'’t you? Do we know you? No. [hesitatingly] I'’m Jessica Rayner and I live over at North Maple and... Well I read what happened to your daughter. How is she? We don'’t know. She'’s in the hospital. [exhales nervously] Well, I'’m here because... because a man attacked me... in my house. And I thought, maybe, that... Can you tell me... anything? Can you tell me [hesitatingly] how it happened? We were asleep. We heard her crying and... We went in and he'’d gone already. Did she tell you what he looked like? [James] No he... [sighs] put a pillow case over her head. She didn'’t see anything. Did he say anything to her? He said he thought she was beautiful. -[intercom buzzing] -Yeah. There'’s a Mrs. Rayner out here. She very insistent. All right. [door clicks open] Detective, I need to talk to you. Mrs. Rayner, Deputy Chief Lasser. Why don'’t you sit down? No, thank you. Detective Corning, it is the same man who attacked me that attacked Sara MacMillan. I talked to her parents. [Greg] Look you shouldn'’t-- -I asked them about the attack and they said-- -[Chief Lasser] Mrs. Rayner? Let me make this clear. I understand your feelings of helplessness and I sympathize. But I won'’t tolerate interference in other active cases. It doesn'’t match the profile. He doesn'’t care about your profile. He'’s an animal. I saw his eyes. He raped me. And he raped Sara MacMillan and he'’s probably raped other women. And he'’s gonna keep on doing it until someone stops him. [door shuts] [Greg sighs] Maybe she'’s not too far off, chief. Three attacks on the north side in a month, I mean something'’s going on. What was she doing talking to those people? Don'’t lose control of this case. I won'’t have freelance cops. Understand? Yes, sir. God, Jessica, you scared the hell out of me. -Where did you go? -Dan, they don'’t believe me. They don'’t think it'’s the same man. -They won'’t listen-- -Tell me when you'’re gonna disappear like that again. Okay? Please. Dan? You believe me, don'’t you? Jessica, I need to know where you are. How can I keep you safe if I don'’t know where you are? Now let'’s go home, all right? [Dan exhales] Can we talk about this at home, please? Come on. [thunder rumbling] Look, I just have to go into the office for a couple of hours. I'’ll just get some deals finished. We'’re not gonna be able to pay the loan this month. But it'’ll be all right. Don'’t worry. If you feel weird or anything call me. I'’ll have this with me all day. I can be home in four minutes. Memory one, that'’s the cellular number. Okay? [engine spluttering] [cloud rumbling] [alarm blaring] [ominous music playing] [phone ringing] Hello, Jessie? Dan, oh my god, it'’s him. Jessie! Jessie, hang on. [horn honking] Where are you? Jessie, I'’ll be there in a minute. All right? Just hang on. [tires screeching] [engine sputtering] God damn it! Jessie! I can'’t hear you. Dan? -Jessie! -[tires screeching] [motor revving] Dan I can'’t hear-- [alarm continues blaring] Shit! [suspenseful music playing] [enthralling music playing] [police siren wailing] Go from the other side all right? Hey, he was here. [Dan] Jessie, you'’re all right? He was here. The screen is on the chair, there'’s foot print in the bushes. [Jessica] He came in through the window. He... [alarm stops] He... But it was right... Jesus! [whispers] Look I understand she'’s upset and a lot of things could happen. -Thank you very much. -All right. Appreciate it. Bye. Look, Jessie... [thoughtfully] it'’s a stormy day. The screen could have been blown out. -It'’s your first day-- -Look, I know what I saw. I am not crazy. It was him. I know it was. He came back. [sighing] Okay. [ominous music playing] [Dan] I'’m heading out. I called Carol. She'’ll be here in a little while. [Dan sighs] I love you. Me too. [ominous music playing] [suspenseful music playing] Hi, honey. What is this? There was a girl raped and killed last year. Eileen Murphy, seven blocks away. He'’s been doing it since then. Jessie? Eileen Murphy, Katie Dobson, Sara MacMillan and me. Four of us and two are dead. I'’m just one of the lucky ones. Now I'’m a witness. He needs to come back to finish the job. You know I think you should put these all away. [exhales] Jessica? [crickets chirping] [door thuds] [board creaking] [thumping] [whispers] Dan. Dan. What? What? -I heard something down stairs. -Okay. I'’ll just take this. I'’ll go take a look. [suspenseful music playing] [footsteps running] -[Jessica] It'’s him. -[door open and shuts] [alarm blaring] [dogs barking] He'’s coming back. He'’s coming back for me. The guy came right into the house. He didn'’t even set off the alarm until after he left. Well, we cranked the sensitivity all the way up. That plus the new sensors will help. I have to tell you Mr. Rayner, our system is perfect. I don'’t care what it costs, Bill. Make it perfect. Okay? Okay. How you doing, Lou? Hey, Mr. Rayner. I did this on all the doors. Set the hole double deep, goes right into the frame. Go on and bolt this. See, inside the lock. Watch this. [thumping] Okay? Now, you want to keep this key some place handy because without it you'’ll have to bust that wall down to get out of here. -Yeah. Thanks, Lou. -Okay. [drill machine whizzing] [man] Excuse me. You know when these guys are done, it'’s gonna be just like Fort Knox. It doesn'’t matter. He'’ll find a way in. -Jessi-- -He will. Jessie, he knows we have an alarm. He knows I'’m waiting up for him. I mean the police are practically camped out in the neighborhood. He'’d be an idiot to try to come back here. Can you try not to worry, please? Please. [door slams shut] [Greg] We are taking the break-in very seriously, Dan. Half the forces is working on your case in one way or the other. Then why is this guy still out? Because he'’s lucky. He won'’t be lucky forever. It'’s already been forever. Greg, please, my wife'’s going crazy. She can'’t sleep. I mean I can'’t sleep. When are you gonna catch this guy? I-- [Dan exhales] Busy? This Dobson case... You know, this is every sex offender in the state of Illinois that owns a beige or brown sedan. Seems someone may have seen one parked by the river. The deputy chief cleared over time as much as you need. [Greg] You could get some other officers to do that for you. I know. I just-- I don'’t wanna miss anything. We did get a break today. The lab test came back. Seems as though some of the blood we found does not belong to Katie Dobson. Our boy has left us a calling card. Hurray! [sarcastically] We should get preliminary DNA back in two weeks or so and as soon as we catch him, he'’s as good as convicted. Ahem, [clearing throat] I won'’t make it home for dinner tonight. Oh, you want to sneak out for burger later? Hey, young lady, don'’t you know that fraternization with a senior officer is strictly against the department policy? Yeah, I remember reading about that somewhere. [Greg thoughtfully] Could you do me a favor? Anything. When the DNA test come back, I'’d like to check them against the semen sample of Jessica Rayner and Sara MacMillan. You think they'’re connected? Maybe. Jessie, we'’ve been through this already. I told you the guy lives in the neighborhood. Right? -Dan, please listen-- -He must because he seems to know his way around. I figured if we cruise around long enough, we'’ll be able to spot him. -Dan. -Look. I called Carol and she'’s on her way over. Please don'’t go. [knock at the door] [door clicks open] Hi. I don'’t want you doing this. You'’re preaching to the converted. Look you pay taxes. Why don'’t you let the cops drive around all night? Dan, please. Jess, just make sure the alarm is set. [door shuts] Look how empty it is. There'’s nobody out here. Somebody must be pretty scared, huh? How is Jessica? She'’ll be fine once I catch this guy. Now keep your eyes open. [siren wails] [police officer] Oh, it'’s you, Mr. Rayner, take care. He'’s sure out of the force. I got stopped on my way over to your house. Yeah, well whatever they'’re doing, it isn't enough. I can'’t believe Dan just took off like that. With all that'’s happened, I can'’t believe he'd leave you alone at night. I'’m not alone. For gods sakes, Jessi he shouldn'’t be out there roaming the streets like some vigilante. You were almost killed, he should be home. In case anything else happens, he should be here to protect you. I don'’t want him to do that. Okay? I don'’t want him to protect me. I just want him to-- I just want him to hold me. Oh, Jess. He hasn'’t touched me. Not once, not since... [sighs softly] I know he'’s trying to be so strong and... and I don'’t care. I just... I don'’t know if he wants me anymore. I want him so much. I need him. Dan, it'’s getting late. I think we should go home. [suspenseful music playing] It'’s him, it's him! [tires screeching] [motor revving] Dan! [tires screeching] Dan, just wait. -Stop. -Hey, easy, easy. Stop right there! All right. What are you doing here, huh? -Easy, easy. -Frank? Easy. Hold it, Dan. Frank, what the hell is going on here. For gods sakes, it'’s Rick Stanzo. He lives in the neighborhood. He'’s been living here for ten years. [exhales] Rick, I'’m really sorry. I'’m sorry, Rick Listen, what are you trying to do? Waving a gun around, you'’re gonna kill somebody. He'’s out there, Frank. Ease up, Dan. He started this, not me. You'’re acting crazy. [eerie music playing] "Crazy." I don'’t think he'’s coming back. But we are set up for him this time. [door shuts] You can go to sleep. Just go to sleep. I'’m staying up for him. Today I'’m staying up for that bastard. What? What is it? Let'’s go to bed. No. We both can'’t sleep. You sleep. I'’ll stay awake, I'’ll keep watch-- Dan, hon, come to bed please. I want us to make love. I need you. No. I shouldn'’t. No, I'’ve to check the windows. Now you go, you go to sleep. I'’ll keep watch. I'’ll be here, I will. I promise I'’ll be here. [whimpering] [Jessica crying] Hi, Jessica. -How'’re you feeling? -I'’m all right, detective. I wanted to know if there was anyway that... I could see the police report on my case. Those reports are not for the public. Why would you want to see them anyway? I just need to make some sense of all this. All right. But you'’ll have to look at them here. [door knocking] Mrs. MacMillan, I'’m Jessica Rayner. We met at the police station. I remember you. I was wondering if we could talk about the attack. This is where he went in. This is Sara'’s room. She doesn'’t... She sleeps in our room now. [suspenseful music playing] [phone ringing] [phone continues ringing] Dan? Dan Rayner'’s office. No, Steve, he'’s on another line. Yeah. I'’ll give him the message. Bye. I'’ll leave you alone. Everything was so good. The business was finally coming together. We had some extra money to spend... For the first time. Everything was so good... then this. In one night. I go away and... everything good just disappears. Oh, God! In one night. Dan, things will get better. It just takes time. I'’ve got the alarm and I stay up all night just to make sure nothing happens. And now she'’s reading her police files and... copying articles out of news papers. [keys jingle] [sighing in despair] She doesn'’t think I can protect her. She'’s been through hell. All the alarm systems in world aren'’t going to make her forget that. She'’s got to put this behind her. How? You got to start doing things again. Normal things. Believe me. It'’s the only way you'’re gonna feel right again. [footsteps walk away] -Oh, hi. -Hi. Are you okay? You know I called all day. I just needed to get out of the house. [Dan] Uh-ha. What'’s that? You'’re having a cleaning fit? No. [CHUCKLES] Will put a grill tomorrow night. I invited Carol and Frank and some of the people from the office. Party? No, it'’s not a party, it'’s a barbecue. You know, then I get to wear my funny chef'’s hat. I don'’t know, Dan. Oh, Jessica, please. We need it. We both do. I mean, we need to make-- We need to make things normal again. Okay? Okay. Great. All I need now is a fine chef'’s hat. [crickets chirping] [car whirring] [woman over radio] [exhales] [somber music playing] [suspenseful music playing] [haunting music playing] [bottles clanging] [door shuts] [intense music playing] [Beth] Five nine blonde, blue eyes, 35, married. Hubby was up stairs, didn'’t hear a thing. I know. It doesn'’t make any sense. Two women murdered, two more raped. Half the police in the city are tracking down leads and we can'’t connect them. When the hell is that DNA test coming? I don'’t know. Next week. I know you'’re the veteran at this but none of this matches with any predator rapist I'’ve ever read about. I mean kidnappers don'’t do break-in. And Dobson and MacMillan, two kids. And Glen and Rayner are two grown women. They don'’t even look like each other. Well, they'’re all pretty tall and blonde. Yeah except for -Sara MacMillan. -Sara MacMillan, yeah. Throw her into the mix and it messes everything up. I know. How is a dark kid have to do with any of this? She looks like her father. Mom was tall and blonde-- He wasn'’t after Sara. He was after the mother. We'’re gonna have to pull every unsolved murder or rape in the past five years. See if there'’s any other cases. Yeah, I'’m gonna go back over all the tests and see what matches up. When that DNA comes in, we can be sure. I don'’t need any DNA. I'’m sure already. Come on. [soft guitar music playing] One burnt to crisp for me, Dan. Absolutely. Here you go. You know, Frank, you'’re absolutely right. This is a great idea. Thanks. Great food. It'’s thanks enough. She knows about that woman last night, huh? Hmm, she wouldn'’t talk about it. She'’s not getting any better, Frank. [guitar music continue] I'’m heading out to the store. We need some more trash bags. Could you stay? I don'’t want to leave her alone. Yeah, sure thing. Do you think we should pull out those bushes? Because he could hide in there like he did before and just jump out. Yeah, I could do it tomorrow. Dan and I will trim it back. Maybe. Maybe that would be better. Maybe that would be a good idea. Hmm. You need a hand? Come on. Move over. I'’m an expert. He killed another woman last night, you know. Yeah, I know. [water gushing] He'’s coming back for me. He... He needs to kill me because I'’ve seen him. Jessica, you'’re totally right to be scared, but have you considered seeing someone? You know a psychiatrist. Someone to help you deal with this obsession-- It'’s not an obsession. Yeah, maybe that'’s not the right word but-- [crashing] [alarm blaring] [intense music playing] Maybe you don'’t need a psychiatrist. [Greg] Yeah, tell him I'’ll hold. He was in the house. I mean, he was five feet away. He only ran because he heard a man'’s voice. What if she'’d been alone? God knows what would have happened. She'’s been saying all along he was coming back. [snickers] She'’s been saying it all along. Do you believe her now? Yes, Frank, I believe that. You do? Well, of course, you do. What are you gonna do about it? Yeah, well, look tell him to hurry up, huh? Look, Frank we have every available car focused on the north side. We'’ve pulled everyone, traffic, vice, office cops. Everyone'’s on triple shifts working this case looking for this guy. -[sergeant] Detective. -Yeah. All right. He was in the house. In the middle of the day. [snickers] This guy'’s got some guts. Jessie, you'’re okay? -I have to go. -What are you doing? I have to go, I have to leave. Jess, where are you going? I can'’t stay here. To move away, another city, some place where he can'’t find me. Far away. Jess, you'’re not going anywhere. We grew up on this street. We know who lives in every single house and who lived here before that and this is our street. No, it'’s his. It'’s his now. Jess, stop it please? Look, I'’m your sister, and I love you but you can not run away from this. You are so much stronger than you think you are. [Carol inhales] Honey, he cannot make you leave your home. This is your home and you are going to have to fight for it. I don'’t know if I can. So what have we got? The guys from vice volunteered to do foot patrols. Now I figured that and with the extra sector cars we should have someone passing by here every ten minutes. Good. -See you at the station. -Yeah. [Frank] Police are running now. They know the score. Now things are gonna happen. Police can'’t protect her. I can'’t protect her. I know Corning. He'’s gonna nail this guy. Go home, Frank. Please. Just go home. [breeze blowing] -Are you all right? -I'’m fine. When was the last time you got a night'’s sleep? Come to bed. No. I should stay down here, in case. I don'’t need you down here. I need you in bed with me. Look I know... I know that you don'’t wanna touch me. And I understand, I feel dirty too. Dirty? [somber music playing] No. God, Jessica. [tearfully] He could never touch the things we had that I love. Then what is it, Dan? I have to stop him. I can'’t let it happen again. Let what happen? You didn'’t let anything happen. I did. I stayed. While I was playing black jack, he came into our house. If I'’d come home... none of this would have happened. [gasps] It'’s all my fault. Don'’t you see? I should have been here to protect you. Sweet heart, you cannot protect me. And the police can'’t protect me. I have to protect myself. Look, I can be scared but I can'’t be helpless. But what if he should come back? He will come back. When he does, we'’ll both be ready for him, both of us. We won'’t be helpless anymore. Come to bed. [Dan exhaling] Then breathe. Then bring the gun down. Always keep the gun down by your side. Sure you wanna do this? You'’ve always hated guns. I do. Even more now. All right, bring it up, release the safety. Dan, I can'’t... Both eyes open. One breath... let it out slowly... [gunshot] Hey, you'’re a natural. [chuckles] Wonderful. Keep it down. All right, this time... start with the gun down, then bring it up. In case you have to do this for real, you don'’t have to spend all day aiming. -All right, on the count of three. -Okay. -You ready? -Ah-ha. One, two, three. So much for being a natural. All right, well, you'’ll have to do what the rest of us do. Practice. Come on. You'’re ready? Bring it up, fire. Again. Okay, let'’s start again at the beginning. Eileen Murphy was killed last year August 1st which was a Sunday. Can you be sure it was the same guy? No, but it is a good guess. [Jessica] Right. Now Katie Dobson was killed June 10th. He broke into our house on the 19th and I was attacked on the 21st. Okay, if it was the same guy. Why did he wait a year? Yeah and why did he attack you and Katie in the same month? Maybe he had a thing for summer. I don'’t know. Windows are open in the summer. Yeah. Smart guy you married. Why is he doing that? Oh, he thinks better when he'’s cleaning. Now this guy likes to come after we'’ve had guests. [Frank] It makes sense. Have friends over, had a few beers, you'’re relaxed. Yeah, we set up our alarm on the 1st and 11th. When was Debbie Gwen killed? Gwen, July 31st. He likes the number, one doesn'’t he? That'’s it. What? What are you guys getting at? [Jessica] The dates. Days with one in them. That'’s when he likes to go out. Jess, half of the days in a month have a one in them. The 1st, the 11th and the 21st. Those of the days he likes best. That doesn'’t make sense. Why? Because he'’s nuts, Frank. That'’s why. And we don'’t need to know why, we just need to know when he'’s coming back so we can catch him. [Jessica] And now... we know. See, we all kind of look alike. Tall with blonde hair except Sara MacMillan so I thought he was after the mother. You don'’t have to convince me, Jessica, because the DNA report came back this afternoon and it'’s a match. You'’re right. It'’s the same man. Are you absolutely sure you don'’t wanna come and work with us? Look, the really important thing is right here. Take a look at this calender. What are these, all the attacks? See, he seems to have an obsession with the number one. I don'’t know, Jessica, it'’s a good theory but... Sara MacMillan was attacked on the 22nd. She was attacked at 3 am. He was out looking for her on the 21st. He just didn'’t find her until after mid-night. See, he'’s crazy. But he'’s predictable. A-ha. Now Saturday is the 11th, his favorite day. -[Greg] And... -We could be ready for him. He likes to come after a party. We'’ll throw a party. He likes to come in that window-- We'’ll open the window. and we'’ll keep the alarm off. He'’s feel totally welcome and when he comes in we'’ll be waiting for him. It'’s a long shot. And I don'’t know if I can get Lasser to commit to man power. Detective... I cannot explain this logically but I know in here that he'’s coming on Saturday night. Okay. [Greg] She'’s scared, but she'’s thinking clearly. She wants one cop on post in her home if we can spare. Do we have anyone to spare? I know it'’ll mean triple shift patrols every night. [Beth] And I know we'’ll have to take a lot of people off the street. It'’s a crazy idea but I think it'’s worth it. [Greg] Let'’s be straight here, chief, we maybe getting closer to this guy but we'’re a long way from catching him. And hell, I didn'’t think he'’s come for Jessica again. But he did. She knows a little something about the way this creep thinks. [sighs] All right. [Chief Lasser] Mrs. Rayner and her-- God I'’ve been pretty sure so far maybe we should start listening to her. Greg, you got the duty. Start tonight. Keep it going for two weeks and we'’ll reassess. Beth you coordinate back up. Yes, sir. Thanks, sir. Maybe we'’ll get lucky. And I'’m in this job for 27 years. I thought I gotten use to it all. Last three weeks I'’ve slept in the hall outside my daughters bedroom. You believe that? Yeah. You get lucky, both of you... [whispers] to catch this maniac. Yes, sir. Brought you a beer. [saxophone music playing] [indistinct chattering] Hey, honey. How are you holding up? Tonight'’s tonight. [Dan clears throat] Come on, smile. It'’s supposed to be a party. Maybe this was a terrible idea. -You want to back out? -[Jessica exhales] No. I want it to be over. [music continues playing] -Please be careful. -Okay. Thanks. Carol. -Hi. -Hi. Should have come for the party. Dan'’s a grill king. Truly amazing. Oh, I have to spend some time with my beautiful wife. She'’s starting think I live here. [door shuts] Well, dishes are done. Can'’t have him breaking into a dirty house, can we? What about this one? His favorite window? Leave it open. Well, now that the cavalry'’s here, I guess I'’ll head home. Thanks, Frank. -Goodnight, Frank. -Goodnight, Dan. Look, if he does come by, don'’t bother saying halt, just shoot him. Bang bang you'’re dead. All right. Have a goodnight. [Frank] Goodnight. [door lock clicks] I got to change. [ominous music playing] [dog barking] Okay, there is food in the fridge and cookies in the cabinet. I don'’t know what else to say except thank you. Greg uh... You be careful. Okay? -Goodnight. -Yeah, goodnight. [suspenseful music playing] I'’m shaking. So glad you'’re with me. Me too. [crickets chirping] [wind blowing] [intense music playing] [eerie music playing] [thumping] [enthralling music playing] [intense music playing] [intense music continues] [thump] Police! Get your hands up! [exhales] Turn around real slow. -What? -[gun firing] [glass shatters] [burglar groans] -Are you all right? -[gunshot] Okay, okay. [breathing heavily] [gunshot] All right, stay here. [Greg] Forty seven, this is 63. -Are you okay? -Stay there. Suspect is in the house. He'’s armed. I say again the suspect is armed. Approach with caution. What happened? I had him and he bolted. I got him cornered in the kitchen. Are you sure you'’re okay? I'’m okay, he took a few shots at me but I'’m okay. Now look, you stay up there and don'’t worry about it. I'’ll get him. You keep that door closed. [glass crashing] -Greg? -Stay there. -Dan? -Greg! Dan, please let'’s get back to the room. Jessie... Jessie, I can'’t wait here. I have to try to go help. -Okay. -[exhales] You go back. And you shoot anybody who comes through that door. Don'’t worry, I'’ll knock first. [whispers] I love you very much. I love you. [intense music playing] -Greg? -[whispers] You go back up stairs. Not a chance, man. All right. [suspenseful music playing] [utensils clanging] All right, come on. [metal clanging] [Dan] Look at this mess. Can I have the flashlight? [enthralling music playing] [Greg] Look at that. [wind blowing] [Dan] Can he squeeze through here? He must be out back. Make sure you'’re locked up behind us. [lock clicks] [enthralling music playing] [indistinct whispers] [ominous music playing] What'’s going on? [whispers] Jessie, he'’s outside. Please just close the window, okay? [thud] [thud] [thud] [thudding] [door knob squelching] [thud] [thud] [thud] [thud] [door vibrating] [thud] [door vibrating] [thud] [intense music playing] -You son of a bitch. -[door clicks] Jessie? [Dan] Jessie no. [gun fires] He'’s in there. -Get away from the door. -Jessie, come here. [glass crushing] He went out the back. -[Jessie squealing] -Jessie, no. Jessie! -[crying] -Stop! [Dan] Jessie, no watch it. -Jessie, wait! -No. [Jessica breathing heavily] No. No.[tearfully] [screaming] No! No. [crying] Jessie, your hand. The suspect has left the premises. He'’s gone out the back end, Oh, Danny. All right, baby. It'’s all right. Let me see. -Oh, Danny. -[shushing] Come on. Come on. It'’s okay, come on. It'’s okay. Come on. It'’s okay. It'’s okay. It'’s okay. -How you holding up? -He got away. We had our chance, he got away. We'’ve got a 150 cops on the North side, Jessica. We'’ll get him. This way please. Greg. -Are you okay? -Yeah, I'’m okay. How is the search going? Nothing yet. What happened? [snickers] I had him. He was right there. A second faster and this all been over. Jessica was right all along. [nurse humming] There. Move it around a little. Well those are some nasty cuts. That'’s for the pain. Thank you. [woman over PA system] [indistinct chattering] [man] They say... They told me it will be about another ten minutes. So just be calm. All right? [man] It'’s a real bloody mess. [nurse] It sure is. Where did you get these splinters? [grunts] I don'’t know. Just working in my shed. [nurse] Well, you'’ll have to take care to '’em '’cause they're pretty deep. [man] All right. [intense music playing] [nurse] This is gonna stay there. Okay? [nurse] Looks like you'’re gonna need about 12 stitches. And I can do them right here if you like. [man] Beautiful. [grunts] It'’s a beautiful tie. [enthralling music playing] Can I help you. What is it? [whispers] That'’s him. Don'’t move. Put your hands behind you. Believe this? After this I'’ll believe just about anything. [Greg] Lets go. Dan, you can'’t. [breathing heavily] [eerie music playing] [Greg] You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say, can and will be used against you in the court of law. You have a right to an attorney. If you do have one or cannot afford one, one will appointed for you. Do you understand these rights as I am explaining it to you? Do you understand these rights? [somber music playing] [mellow music playing] [Dan] You need any help? I can handle it. Hey, I know you can. [closing theme playing]
