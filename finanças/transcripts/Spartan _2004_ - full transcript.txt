She signs all of her letters with that. lt's because she... -...sees things cockeyed, like Picasso. -Picasso. She says they call her Picasso. Why did you fight with her, son? She got her hair done. Dyed it blond. She cut it off. l called her a slut. Wait. We've all seen the pictures. Beautiful young girl like that... ...what do you care what color she dyes her hair? Now why does that make her a slut? She's fucking another guy. You want to talk about it? lf you want to talk about it, l will give you one minute. Nothing hurts worse than that, if she's sleeping with another guy. There's this.... This teacher that.... l shouldn't be telling you this. She's sleeping with a teacher? Well, she says she isn't. l said if she wants to fuck old men, she should go to the Back Light, go all the way. -Back Light? -Yeah. lt's this club by the Fenway. lt's like a joke at school, like a rumor. This girl or that girl went with a businessman for one night... ...made a thousand bucks. This is a lovers' quarrel, all right? l said something that l regret. l sent a note that l regret. l can assure you, officer... ...if you see your way clear to give me a break, it'll never....

He's holding up. -He was in town yesterday to see her. -He was? -We snuck him in and out. -How long were they together? -Parker. -One second. -He copped to it. -Copped to what? Left his post. Punched out early to go boffing his girlfriend. Hope she was worth it. -Sir. -All right. Let's get back on it. Okay. Back Light. A restaurant, The Black Night... ...The Black Light, a bar, a supper club. Black Light, that's it. Put up the graphics on the girl. Take a look at this.

All right. -What happened to your wedding ring? -l took it off. Did you go off your wife? No, sir, l'm working. Keep your mouth shut, your eyes open. And form on me. Move aside. Move aside! Oh, Jesus. All right, then. Who saw it? l believe he had a hideout piece. Who frisked him? Who frisked the son of a bitch? The girl he went to see, get her in. The one he was fucking. -Two guys to her house, right now. -Seal the room off. Check out the file. Seal the room off. He was off post when he snatched the girl? Yeah, well, apparently he felt bad about it. -Show me a set of keys. -l ain't got them. Here, you take the chain. You've got the over-watch. Swing the chain. You're a guy walking the dog. Loosen your collar. Told me 2:00. lt's closing time, gents. Time to pack it up. Don't gotta go home, but you can't stay here. Closing up. Can't sell booze after 2 a.m. No, l just wanted to pay you that money l owe you. -How about them Sox, huh? -Yeah, what are you gonna do? Yeah. ''Curse of the Bambino,'' isn't that what you call it? That's right. Where are you from? Yeah, well, actually, l was just trying to find my niece. Oh, that's what you're looking for? Because a lot of guys come in here looking for someone else's niece. No. Girl like that... ...been in tonight? -Pretty girl. -Yeah, that's my type. Girl like that been in? You sure you're looking for your niece? Because a lot of guys come in here and go home with some rather younger girl. No, no. Why--? Why would... ...a younger girl like that want to be with a guy like me? Howdy, pard. l was wondering if l could ask you a favor. l love you, baby, but the season's over. Your friend said you were sort of a matchmaker. Look, you can't believe everything you hear. -Catch you later. -You know it. Okay, lock it up. Drive safely, now. -Yeah? -l was looking for a girl. For a young girl. Well, aren't we all? My question was, why would a young, pretty girl like that... ...go out with a guy like me? And if you could answer that.... Look, bub.... What is this?

You don't need one. We need the girl. Give us the girl. This girl was not here. l'm entitled to my lawyer. You're entitled to shit. You're entitled to tell me what you know. lf the girl was here... ...if you cooperate, l'll see what l can do. l think l can help you, if you tell me now. Why would l not tell you if the girl was here? The girl is new. They told us that it was her first night. But look here. There's two pinholes in the photo. They moved it over. Photo's missing. Where is she? -l don't want to get in trouble. -You don't know what trouble is. l'm not even sure that was her. She was sick. She was not very well. -She came in here and.... -She came here? They took her. l told Nadya she shouldn't be here. They took her. Who is ''they''? They took her? Where did they take her? Honey, you got all the slack in the world until l leave this room. And then l'm going to zero you out. Two men. They gave her a shot. l think that was her. -Where is she? -l'm entitled to my rights. -l'm entitled to my phone call. -You don't understand. You'll leave your life, or you'll leave the information in this room. Where is the girl? They'll kill me. Who did you call? How did you know to come pick her up? How did they know to get her? Who did you call? lt's just a number-- Write it down. Write it down. l'm gonna see what l can do. Just give me the number. l don't understand. She's just some girl. Oh, my God. They don't know who they've got. Sir. Where's the girl? Sir, we believe she was abducted from this club. That she was taken to-- That she was taken to a bordello. -Here in Boston? -Yes, sir, and that-- That-- -Let's hear it. -She may have been delivered for sale.

You'll have to go half-speed, baby, because l don't follow you. -ls there an operation in Dubai, sir? -Pal... ...the girl fell off a boat. She's dead. l'm on leave. l don't know nothing about Dubai. l don't know what the hell you want with me. There's a Army depending on us for the truth. You can lie to anyone else. Never lie to a Ranger. Okay, so that's you calling me a liar. Sir, l saw the sign! -What sign is that? -At the beach house. She was there. She wasn't there. She died on a boat. l saw the sign. Sir. You saw the sign? You were up for a week. You don't know what you saw your first time out. Sir, l know what l saw. You didn't see no sign because she wasn't there. The hardest thing? You know what it is? lt isn't going in the door, it's coming out. You ever come down off of drugs? The most powerful drug in the world is adrenaline. -l told you everything l know. Stand down. -Look in the bag. -Stand down! -Sir, under my mat! This got caught in my mat at the beach house. Would you tell me what that is? The girl is not dead, sir. Would you show me where you found the earring? l laid the mat down right here. What? The house looked closer that night. Barometer's falling. Low pressure, objects appear farther. Watch the weather, baby, because it's going to change. Yeah. Will you show me where you saw the sign? Yeah, hold on. Hey, it was over here! Let me speak to the Chinaman. You tell him, ''The only man ever heard him call on Jesus.'' Yeah. Yoke me out. New set of clothes from the skin out. Full set of papers. l don't care where, but now. You gotta get me to the tall corn. l'll get you the money. All right. Two hours. No. Wait. Not two hours. Something later. l'll get back to you. The original building, of course, dates to 1928. The center for the treatment of alcoholism, later, of substance abuse... ...takes its current name, The Clearings, from the original Johnson farm. Would you please follow me to the right. The farm and its 2000 acres were a gift from the Johnsons.... -What could be worse than losing a child? -Yes. You'd like to comfort them, but you don't know how. l always think it's best just to-- -What is it? -Security breach. Probably a phone threat. lt's all right. They're moving her down to transport now. lt's okay, l'm with Secret Service. Guess again. l'm Secret Service. And you'll follow my directions, or l'll shoot you dead. -Yes. -Step away from the door. Yes. l have a message for her. -l have something to tell her. -Take two steps to your left. Yes. l have a message for Mrs. Newton. l'm sure you do. Spread your arms, please, out to the sides. Open your hands. -Open the box. -l.... l'm 10 minutes from the bomb squad. lf it's happy birthday, let's do it now. Open the box. They took her protection. Her father was in town. They took the Secret Service detail off her to take him tomcatting. He didn't come to see her, he came to get laid. He's been doing it for years. He took her protection. She got snatched. The girl on the boat, how do you fake the DNA? -Laura Newton's alive. -l don't know if Laura Newton's alive. l know they lied. How do you fake the DNA? You don't fake the DNA. You issue a press release. -Her father would let her die? -Did you try to contact him? -l did, yes. -And you still don't get it, do you? You don't get it. These people are savages. They don't know how many children they have. She was snatched while he was cheating on his wife. lt comes out, they lose the election. So they said, ''Let her go.'' -Who? -His handlers. -What does he know? -What they tell him. -What did they tell him? -That she was dead. -Why? -So he'd stop looking for her. Oh, baby. Where are you going? -l have to get a lot of running room. -Wait. Who will get her back? -What? -Who will get her back? -l did my part. -What part was that? -They gotta get her back. -There is no ''they.'' -l'm just a worker bee-- -She'll die. -Then go through the mother. -l'm her mother! She gave birth to her. l raised her. l'm her mother. She's just a little girl. You have to get her back. l have nobody. Nobody ever loved her but me. She's just a little girl. lt's been quite a long while since my last confession. We were getting shelled in the open. And l confessed that l was frightened. So l suppose l'm.... l suppose l'm frightened now. There was a king... ...and he had a daughter... ...and she was abducted. He vowed to protect her, you see, but... ...while he was indulging himself, shamefully... ...she was abducted. They tried to get her back and failed. Now, his advisors realized that if the girl returned... ...it would reveal the king's shame to the country. So they told him that she was dead. Ain't nobody here but two people in green. lt goes beyond that. Nothing goes beyond that. This girl, they told the king that she was dead... ...and everybody grieved. But she was alive. Then you better go get her. We know this house. Maskala is a suburban villa in Dubai. Some people operate a halfway house there... ...for young women they have coerced or drugged... ...into spending their short lives as whores for Arabian tourists. Of late, the girls have been, in the main, from the former Sov bloc. Now and again, a North American girl, if she is exceedingly lovely... ...blond, usually blond... ...will unfortunately find her way to Dubai. They travel drugged. They are tidied up and sold. For some reason, most of them are sold to Yemen. The girls are generally held in Dubai till the end of the month... ...when the merrymakers fly in to examine their purchases and take them home. -And then? -That is ''and then.'' -This is an American girl? -And if that were so? lf that were so, why don't your people go and fetch her? -Why don't they go and get her, Bobby? -Your intel, two men. lnfil, exfil. -Hardware and comms. -And comms to what? l cannot give you. -You could when you were a Boy Scout. -l'm not in Scouts anymore. You heard of the private sector? That's where you found me. Well, then sell me something. What the fuck are we talking about? -That's what it costs? -That's what it costs you. lt's a straight-up snatch. We got one, two guys take down the car. Then what are we talking about? A Conex container? One guy for a day? Who's looking for a whore? This job's a gimme. This job's nothing. Then why don't your people go and get her? -l could hire anybody. -So go hire them. You talked to me. That's my price. -There's another alternative. -What? As l said, we know this house. -There are some people in this house... -Avi. ...that if you were to go while you were there... ...if you said hello to them for me, l could cut your price. -What do you think l am? -l don't know what you are. You ain't a planner. You're a shooter. l don't know what you are doing here. l think you're off the reservation. And l think there are people looking for you. You call, ''Yoke me out.'' Then you call for information. You don't need information. You need advice. You wanna get this girl? Are you sure she is there? Are you sure she is alive? You let me make a call, and l will tell you. l will see if l can make peace. lf l cannot, l will help you disappear. Because you heard me call on Jesus. Let me help you to see if you can go home. Excuse me. Fasten your seat belt. We're landing soon. Thank you. Sir, your container is booked out on Transgeneve. Flight 562. 1340, tomorrow. Good. Thank you very much. l appreciate your help. Mate, can l have a quick word? l've got an outbound at 8:15. -l'm in a bit of a hurry. -Just a moment. -Yes, sir. Let me see your form. -Thanks, man, l really appreciate it. Let me see your form. -Sir? Sir? -Yes, l'll seal you in. -Sorry to press you. -No, no. lt's been a very busy day. Same wherever you go. Guess that's just human nature, but no need to tell you your business. There you go. Your container is all sealed for you. -Thank you for your patience. -Thank you. Have a great day. Hey, mate. Hey, mate. Are you Mr. Brown's cousin? No, Mr. Jackson couldn't come. -l was expecting you on a later flight. -How about that? Yes, this is good work. Your job tomorrow is put us in, seal us in, walk away. -And in Geneva? -Let's go look at the ground. About 25, 26 yards from the corner, l want the gasoline. Tomorrow, the car comes around the corner-- How do we stop the car? -We slow it down with two Bedouin women. -What do you want the gasoline for? -Do you speak Arabic? -Yes, sir. l want the women here. At your signal, they go in the street... ...start a screaming match. l shoot the tires out. The driver comes out. You cap him. l get the girl. -What if he doesn't come out? -l got five gallons of gasoline. l douse the car. l throw a match. They're coming out. When you get me the two women... ...pay them half now, half tomorrow. Then l want you to show me the hive. We'll lay low till tonight. Then show me the house where they keep the girl. All right. Limousine, usually. lt makes a turn, comes down Abu Baku, where we were today. My job is the hostage. Your job is the opposition. You come in on the driver's side. You cap the driver. The map's wrong. This isn't north. lt's flipped. You have to be on the east side. l need the sun in the driver's eyes. l've gotta come in on the opposite side. How did you know that was north? That's Cassiopeia. That's my girlfriend. They're moving the girl. Looks like it. -Did you burn me? -Can't say l did. -You wanna prove it? -Well, the Lord hates a coward. We're taking the girl now. Keep your eyes on me. We're gonna fight the girl out. lf l go down, get her to Geneva. There's money in it for you. l'm gonna grab the girl. You keep them off my back. You wanna gossip or you wanna shoot somebody? Stop. Wait, wait. Shut your fucking mouth. -Where am l? -l'm here to take you home. You got to keep still. l'm here to take you home. Drink it. -Who are you? -Drink it. How are you? l'm sick. No, it's just a formal question. Cover your head. -What, you don't like blondes? -The whole world likes blondes. That's why you're here. Put it on. Put it on. And stay away from the window. -l need a smoke. -You can't smoke it. What's it gonna give me, cancer? Smell of American tobacco carries in the desert air. That's why you wanna stay out of the desert. l could make you give me the smoke. Keep it together. Keep your voice down. We're gonna get you home. Fuck it. l don't wanna go home. Nobody there cares about me. l'm just a whore. l'm just a little whore. Yeah, how'd you get like that? l was raised by wolves. What are you crying for? We're going home. Did my father send you? That's right. Why? Why? He wants me dead. He sent me. One man. ''One riot, one Ranger.'' You ever heard that? Leonidas, King of Sparta... ...when a neighboring state would plead for military aid, would send one man. -Well, there you go. -You ever hear that? No. l think we went to different schools. You ever hear the one about the king who turned his daughter into gold? Yeah. He turned his daughter into gold. America's sweetheart. His fucking trick pony. His election ad. Fucking cocksuckers. He took the guards away. l just wanted to talk to him. He wouldn't even come and see me. He said he would come and see me. He sent a man. ''Here's what you tell the press. Don't talk. Don't tell anybody.'' l told him l was gonna tell. He had to come and see me. And he wouldn't even come and see me. He sent me. l don't wanna go home. Look, you go home... ...some wave their hats, some turn their backs. lt's all the same. None of them know where you've been. lt's all the same. You tough, honey? l think you're tough. l'm cold. lt'll be fine, baby. You're gonna take a little flight in here. -You're coming with me. -No, l've got to seal you in. You want a cigarette? -Can you produce one? -Believe l can. Sit down. You said they couldn't violate their airspace. -What? -They couldn't violate their airspace. That's right. They couldn't violate their airspace. -That's why you had to come alone. -That's why l had to come alone. But l tell you what... ...when this plane touches down... ...you will be in the bosom of a company of United States Marines... ...all straight up and down and vying for your attention. What could be better? Do you have a comb? l don't believe l ever carried one. Thank you. For what? For coming for me. Well, what the hell. What's that? l believe it's an apple seed. -Johnny Appleseed. -Yeah, that's me. Just a man of peace. Get on the phone. Get to our people. See if they can seal off-- There she is. Get her! Cut him off. Cut him off! Laura Newton! Laura! You! The man. Step away from the girl. Walk to me, Miss Newton. Walk to me. My name is Stoddard. You've seen me in your home... ...with Mr. Burch. You're almost home. Walk to me. This man is a rogue agent. He came here to take you... ...for the ransom. Even if it was true, you're coming with me. -Get up. -Laura? This man was sent to harm you. He knows l'm not leaving here without you. Give her up. Give the girl up... ...and we can talk. We have control of the airport. Let her come forward. We leave in a minute.

Get it out! l'm not leaving until l find out what's going on. -Find it. What do you see? -Hold on. Hold on. We've got you. We've got you now. We've got you. Thank God we found you. Here you go. Come get her! Thank goodness we found you. Hey, get her out of here! Clean this mess up. l'm at the airport. lt appears to be a gunfight. A gunfight! No, l don't know who. l'm staying to tape it. Hold the plane! You could have come home! You know that? You dumb son of a bitch! We needed you! lt's World War lll out there! World War lll! Do you read the papers? And that little whore wanted to bring the man down. At this time! -l'm going home? -That's right, honey. You bet you are. And just one more thing. -l'm getting in the car. -No, honey, there is no car. We have to get you out of here. No. Who are you? Me and Mr. Scott came to take you home. Do you know what we've had to do all these years... ...to keep her under wraps? You shortened her life, pal! We would have let her go to the desert, but you had to put on your thinking cap! Hold on one minute! -Go on, what do you see? -Okay. -Are you getting it? -Get on the plane. Oh, my God. -l got her. -Hold the plane! Laura Newton! Get her on the plane!

And as we return again... ...the administration, forced by this terrible abduction-- -Thank God they had that ability. -That's right. To capitalize on the drowning deaths, to capitalize on the unfortunate deaths... ...of those two people sailing. Here is the arrival of Laura's father. Who can forget these images? -Laura Newton in the United States. -Yes, indeed. Many believe that Robert Burch is due not only the thanks... ...but the admiration of the entire American people for his role. Terror takes many forms. I can conceive of no act of terror greater than the unforgivable... ...the ultimate destruction, that of a human soul. The kidnapping of Laura Newton has revealed to us... ...has allowed us to confront and will allow us to eradicate... ...the international traffic in souls. It was brought about because of a family's love for their daughter. A simple American act. The love of Americans for all our daughters... ...who are the soul.... Who are the soul of this great country. -We thank God... -Time to go home. ...this one daughter has returned home. We vow that we will not rest... -Lucky man. -...until all who have suffered her fate... ...are once again reunited with their families. Thank you.
