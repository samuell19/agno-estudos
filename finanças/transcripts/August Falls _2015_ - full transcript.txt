- Four door, and the license plate, last seen south bound, Woolley Avenue. Has been two hours, no further information. Where are you staying? - I just came straight from the airport. Augy's place, I guess. - I'm very sorry for your loss, ma'am. I am. But his emotional state isn't something that No, please, leave the lights off. So you manage this whole place by yourself? - Yeah, keeps me occupied. It's my old man, was my old man's building. Thank you for, for this. I just can't. - Don't worry about it, it's okay. to have him in our lives. The thing about it is, that that boy's heart was perfectly clean and that's what made him so impossible to hold on to. That, that strange purity, that radiance - August dated him for a couple weeks, right at the end, it was nothing serious. Sean, no that was serious. They were together for over a year and broke up about a month ago. Juan was just a rebound. - Augy never even told me he was gay. - Did you ever ask him? I think there's more to this world than people will allow themselves to see. Just try to clear your mind and picture him. And then focus on that image in your heart and ask questions, listen for the answers. Sounds simple but, you gotta be open to it. It's more than just an act of faith, It wasn't a suicide, you know. - What? - It wasn't a suicide. he never would give up, he wasn't a quitter. And then his friend Eric, he said something to me And I don't believe it either. - I think I might something a little stronger than tea. Yes, I will. Yes. Alright, thanks, bye bye. - And here's my birthday boy. - And does that look like somebody who's about to take their own life? - Sometimes mood is different after things wind down. - Someone had to have gone back to his place after the party. - Just to throw him out the window? They were all happy. I mean, there was all those people there, it just, this doesn't make sense. - I suppose, but what can you do? - Hi, Juan, it's me, Augy's mom. - Yes, I know. What do you want? - Hey! Who do you think you are? What do you want from me? - I'm sorry, I just want to know where you were the night of the party, why you weren't there. - I was at work! Where were you, ever? - Hey. - Hey. - You must be getting kinda tired of me just showing up and barging in like this, huh? - It's kinda nice to be needed. You okay? - A suspect? Who? - Well I went to go talk to Juan. He was acting, very. - What? - Well I asked him a question and the way that he responded was totally out of proportion, he just blew up on me. - Augy are you there? - Yes? - This is so sweet. - I've had it forever. You want a drink? - Yeah. He got that from his dad. - He told me about him. - No, he would have, well, he would have told you about his step dad, he'd never knew his biological father. - What was he like? - I couldn't really tell you. - Because, Augy was bright and sweet but he was also dirty and sad. You're a, I've just seen people I've cared about vanish. - Augy's friend Sean is gonna take me out on his boat this weekend to deliver them, the ashes to the bay. Would you like to come with me? - I would. Can you hear me? Please talk to me. - Are you alright? - I'm good. - Where are you, baby? - I'm with friends. - Hey. - I know you're gonna wanna try to talk me out of this, Thanks for checking for me. I do, the gentleman's name is Juan. I see. He was. Okay. Yeah, thank you. Bye bye. Well, so much for that theory. To August. We will all miss him. - We will. - I've got a little errand to run. You okay? - Yeah. Actually, I'd really rather not be alone just now. - It's still my legal residence. I got rid of most of my parent's stuff. I keep meaning to put it on the market but. - This is sweet. There are no other photos here, is this one of a kind? Sometimes I wonder what might have been going through his mind when he took that. - Maybe he was just happy. - That would have been a little out of character. - And you are? - His mother. I want his boyfriend, Sean. - Why, what did he do? - It's about money and I don't like to discuss my finances with new acquaintances. However, when you scattered those ashes, - Just to help me sleep. - Yeah, okay. It really is beautiful here. The lake I mean. - This is about where that picture was taken. - I hope he was happy when he took it. That's a rookie dealer. - I'm sure he is. A very special someone with an inch he can't scratch and a pocket full of cash. - Someone like Augy? - No no, Augy never had that, that look about him, you know. - I knew a person with a problem. She came here, I came here with her. At first I was trying to stop her, just to find her, to know where she was. I like to think that love feels a little better than what we had. Anyway, it ended badly as these things do. She took off. I found myself coming to the park without her. Told myself I was getting over her. - Do you know what ever became of her, what happened? - I got clean, and when you get clean, you lose track of a lot of people. Maybe I'll just leave you alone with your thoughts. - Is it? - Yeah. before he started crying. But I still heard him. - Why would you let him do that? - Well, you have to understand, We were very very close. He was my world. And I saw so much of myself in him, that I just, I worried, you know, how, how is this kid gonna grow up to be a man? I can't teach him those things and Mac did care for me, I need to ask you something. I'm parked out back. you have 24 hours, do you understand? 24 hours and then I escalate. - Read your statement. So I guess the first question's kind of obvious, why didn't you call us after the break in? You had two armed men waiting for you in your room. - It's not my room. - Do you? - She right about me, that detective. What happened to Eric is my fault. - That's not true. Whiskey too, if you need it. - Jonas? That was quick! - Listen, listen to me, time is money. I need both, I've got neither, okay? No, she's not hurt. Don't, don't get macho with me, old man, okay? You go to the cops, you screw me over, she's long gone before anyone finds her, okay? So on Friday at noon, there's gonna be a car outside your building, you just put the money in the back seat in a briefcase, nothing tacky and and we're done here. - Don't what? Let me tell you, it's not that complicated, just to tip somebody out a window. - You bastard son of a bitch! - You're right on both counts. - Why? - He kept nagging me. He liked the parties and he liked the boat and all the other trappings but he just got these these spasms of morality. Probably something he got from you. - Anna. Are you okay? - I think so. - Oh thank god. Another couple minutes and I was gonna swing by the ER. - Thank you, Jonas. - Did you pay them? - Considered going to the police, after the way they treated you, - Justice. - Not if you don't reach. Listen. His, personal affects are ready to be picked up in the evidence room. - Time, doesn't run out. It's an ocean. Your life is your own little boat. - Did she do it? Did Louise push you? - I hit the ground to make it from where I was to where I am. - I've got to look Louise in the face and tell her that I know what she's done. - You expect a confession? - I don't need one. - Well so what, you'll, you'll just know, - When Mac and I first got together, Augy was just little still. speak up, boy. It was just little, you know, at the time it seemed like he was just trying to be a dad and trying to show Augy how to be a man and a tender boy, a sensitive boy. I remember looking out the window and watching him march Augy around this field like a soldier for hours. Buck like a man, straiten your back. Just yelling at him. And I didn't stop him. I didn't do anything. Had I stopped him, I know my boy will be alive, Augy would still be here. I'm here now.
