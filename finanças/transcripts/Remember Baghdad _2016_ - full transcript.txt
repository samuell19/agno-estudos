It's two in the morning. Edwin Shuker is getting ready to go to Iraq. He is a Jewish North Londoner with a point to prove. Who is going to even believe that there were Jews in Iraq? I can no longer carry on living as if nothing has happened and tell my son that he was born in Finchley and this was where his ancestry started. We are part and parcel of Iraq, and I will not let go. Edwin wants to buy a house north of Baghdad. It's so that he can say the Iraqi Jews still have a stake in their homeland. As long as a move like this is being taken, as long as a house is being bought, the Jews of Iraq, we are still there, and that gives me the sense of belonging. For decades, Baghdad has meant violence, and the last place most people would want to call home, especially the Jews. But it wasn't always so. ♪ Got no diamonds, got no pearls ♪ ♪ Still I think I'm a lucky girl ♪ ♪ I got the sun in the morning And the moon at night ♪ ♪ I got the sun in the morning And the moon at night ♪ ♪ Got no mansion ♪ I first came across the Jews of Baghdad when I was asked to catalogue an archive. It belonged to the family of David Dangoor. There were hours of home movies and thousands of photographs. My mum used to carefully write what the event was. They had a lot of parties. I found myself looking at frothy scenes of an affluent modern life. And they were jumbled in with pictures where David's family looked to me like traditional Arabs. The family started more religious than most because my great grandfather had been the chief rabbi and had been a rabbi all his life. But in my parents' generation, people began to feel religion was something umm, of the past. Life was good for them in Baghdad. People started moving out of the ghetto and my family was one of those. They bought a house on the river. And this is my mum and dad, walking arm-in-arm. One day, Naim and Renee Dangoor got a spectacular invitation. It was New Year's Eve, late on New Year's Eve that my father said to my mum there was a very fancy party at the Amana Hall with members of the royal family and the government there. When they walked in, there was a competition going on. Something that hadn't happened before in Baghdad, Miss Baghdad. And they were down to the last five girls… finalists. The Regent and ministers said, "We can't let this competition carry on, unless this young lady agrees to join the final five." And, sure enough, she was chosen as the winner. The crown prince gave her the sash and a statuette and she was in the newspaper the next day. This is David's Monday evening volleyball game in London. All friends, all Jews from Iraq. Scoop, scoop, scoop. But count them. There are more Iraqi Jews on this court than there are in the whole of Iraq today. When David's father was born, there were 140,000 Jews in Baghdad. They made up nearly half the city. Few people in Baghdad now remember them, though their houses and old synagogues are everywhere. Edwin has arrived in Baghdad looking for his roots. I feel I haven't finished with this place. I owe it and it owes me. There is unfinished business here. I don't even know the dangers lying around, because when I tell people I've been here and I've been there, and they say, "My God. On your own? Are you kidding? Are you crazy?" I feel as if I am a Jew living in Baghdad forever. Edwin wasn't just being flowery. Iraqi Jews are the ones in the Psalms, the ones who were captured and taken as slaves, the ones who sang, "By the waters of Babylon, there we sat down and wept, when we remembered Zion." They stayed and wrote the great book of Jewish Law, the Babylonian Talmud. They were below the Muslims in society, but they ran their own affairs as Babylon became Mesopotamia, and as Mesopotamia became Iraq. Back in London, I went to meet David Dangoor's aunts. They were born on the banks of the Tigris when Iraq was ruled by the British. Now Eileen and Doreen live in flats, one above the other. Careful, careful. This is my grandfather, the Chief Rabbi of Iraq. It was hanging in our sitting room in Baghdad. - To show that life was… - Good. The king, of course, in the middle. King Feisal the First. His speech was that Iraq now, we don't have religions, we are all Iraqis, Jews, Muslims and Christians, we are all Iraqis. It was a good time. It was very… It was paradise. This paradise was created by the British, who took Baghdad in 1917. Conquest was not as easy as they hoped, but once there was peace, in 1921, the state was formed and they imported a Saudi Prince to be king. The British called the new country Iraq. This little boy being pulled along in a toy British tank is Eileen's cousin, David Khalastchi, on his father's farm near the town of Babylon. I loved it. I won't change it for the world and this is really my happiest memory. The British wanted to develop Iraq, and the Khalastchis went into business with the tribes living on the land around Babylon. My father had fantastic relation with the head of the tribe. I mean, if I tell you, you cannot believe it. They were like brothers, and when I say like brothers, like brothers! I mean they are, they come to our home, we go to their home. We were just like part of one house. David Khalastchi lives near Ascot, in England. At that time, in Iraq, very few people, they can speak English and a number of Jewish people, they can speak English. And my father, luckily, we were, he can speak English. And if you spoke English, you could be part of the new economy. We brought the machinery from England. The power of the English, very strong, they were the rulers. And if you are in line with the British, there's nothing can beat that. But not all Iraqi Jews were in line with the British. I met Salim Fattal in Israel. I, and many others like me, in the poor class, thought the British, you are… robbing our resources, our oil, and you… you are trying to tell us what to do. We don't want any foreigners here. We want to rule ourselves by ourselves. Do not interfere. You have nothing to… go home. But when British rule ended in 1932, the oilmen didn't go home. The young, air-minded king of this little-known country meets with directors of the Iraq Petroleum Company, while shama al-sheikhs give the authentic desert touch. Now to the pump station. Four million tons of oil a year… It was independence on terms, I would say. Umm, the real masters were not the government, the British. But the British were not the only ones after Iraqi oil. As disaffection with the British grew, the Germans promoted Hitler as a liberator. And in 1933, Mein Kampf was translated into Arabic. I met Shaul Menashe, who was a child in Basra. There was a famous saying, "God in the sky and Hitler on the ground." It sounds like a poem. The Nazi's key Arab supporter came to Baghdad in 1939, at the start of the Second World War. The Grand Mufti of Jerusalem shared the German desire to kick the British out of the region. And like them, he hated the Jews. The Germans had been funding his campaign to fight the imminent creation of Israel. Now he was in Iraq to help Hitler to win the war. The Jews did not understand what happened in Iraq. With the Mufti and the influence of the Nazis during the '30s, they are in danger, the Jews are in danger. Slowly, the atmosphere in Baghdad started to change. The Mufti moved into this house, on the banks of the Tigris in Baghdad, next door to David's family, the Dangoors. David's aunt Eileen was a teenager when anti-Jewish attacks started happening nearby. Once my brother, then myself, we went out for a walk on the riverside, and then a bicycle passed by, and suddenly I felt something hot on my back. It was burning, my dress was burning. He threw acid on me. Immediately, my brother tore my dress. It happened to a few girls. In early 1941, the Mufti wrote to Hitler. "Your Excellence Great Fuhrer, the Palestinian problem has united all of the Arab States in a mutual hatred of the English and the Jews." "The Arabs are willing to shed their blood in the Holy War, and end the oil flow for England." "Great Fuhrer, my wishes for a long life and shining victory." The public mood in Iraq turned against the monarchy, and in March 1941, the Regent fled with the boy king, leaving Iraq to the fascists and its oil to the Germans. Once again, the British invaded. A few Nazi Messerschmitts came over, probably from Syria. These were driven off and the RAF remained in control of the Iraq skies. Heavy losses were inflicted on the rebels on the Fallujah Road. Within a month, the British had secured the oil fields and had control of the country. But they didn't want to look like an occupying force, so they stopped outside Baghdad and waited for the return of the pro-British king. British sympathisers inside Baghdad were in danger. The Nationalists were defeated completely by the end of May. They have frustrations, who is the object that can be the victim for this frustration? The Jews! I met Esperance Ben Moshe in Tel Aviv. She was living in the suburbs, and her family didn't realise anything was wrong. My grandfather went shopping, he was beaten very badly. They called him, "You are Jewish, you are English". And he was beaten and he was bleeding all over. That night, a riot started. In Jerusalem, I found Eli Amir, who was in the centre of Baghdad. The Muslims invaded the Jewish Quarter. We knew that they, this way or the other, they'll, they'll kill Jews. All night, we were up there on the roof, frightened to death. Waiting for something bad to happen. There were banging, doors were breaking, people shouting, crying. We heard the crowd coming on the stairs. My father knocked to the neighbour, he said, "Please, give us refuge." The neighbour called his guard and they started to cross us to the other side. My uncle, was slaughtered there, and his partner of the business, both of them. They lived together, they died together, in Babasher, the place where they stopped the buses, and took the Jews outside and they killed them. Our neighbours were Muslims, and my mother and her neighbour, they were very good friend. She breastfed me, God bless her, Helijah is her name, came to our house, she was a strong one, a big one, and she stood there. And she protected us for three days. She saved our life. The next day, they said about 180 people were killed and almost two thousand people were injured. When the royal family returned with the boy king, finally, the British went into Baghdad. The British betrayed the Jews in 1941. They could have stopped when it just had started. The Jews felt that the British betrayed them because the Jews, we were supporting them. After 1941, with the monarchy back in place, Iraq was at peace for the rest of the war. The Mufti fled and went to Berlin. The Dangoors bought the house where he lived and their kids got to play in the Mufti's garden. The war hardly touched them. There were parties every night. The community was living in a bubble. They were not touched by the Holocaust and they were living as if there was no war and nothing has happened much. So, my father was very happy to stay on in Baghdad. David Shamash is David Dangoor's neighbour in London, as he was in Baghdad when they were children. There's always hope that a bad episode was a one off and it won't repeat itself. When times were tough, and they wanted to leave, they weren't able to, the doors were barred to Jews, but when things improved and they could leave, they said, "Why leave now?" There's a certain amount of wishful thinking that blurs the truth a little. But the less well-off Jews were worried. They saw the riot during the war as a warning. Zvooloon Hareli joined a secret cell. The riot was a shock. And in high school, all 15- and 16-year-olds were saying, "No More! No more!" We need to do everything we can to leave Iraq and move to Israel. Today he teaches kids at the Babylonian Museum in Tel Aviv, and he's bringing his replica guns to tell them about how Zionists working for the creation of Israel came to train them in Baghdad. This is a national conference attended by representatives from all branches. She was the general secretary of the Young Pioneer Movement. He is from Kirkuk, from Basra, Kirkuk, Baghdad. This is me with the moustache. I represented Baghdad. And it was all done secretly. The keen young Baghdadi Zionists were essential to the Jewish leader David Ben Gurion. He was building his new country and he wanted a million immigrants to people it and to defend it. Ben Gurion at the time thought, "Don't argue with me, bring them, bring the Jews here because we don't know what will happen tomorrow. Today I know we can bring them, so let's bring the Jews here." Esperance Ben-Moshe decided to learn Hebrew, the chosen language of the new state. I don't know who the people were that came to study with me. We went far, far away in the desert somewhere, near the river, somewhere very far, nobody lives there, nobody, not a soul there. It was like the end of the world there. We had picnics. They were talking about Israel, it was like Garden Eden, like Eden, the Garden of Eden. So everybody was interested to go. In May 1948, Palestine was partitioned to make way for the new Jewish homeland, Israel. We hereby declare the establishment of a Jewish state in the Land of Israel, named the State of Israel. The dream came true for the Zionists and a nightmare began for the Jews still living in the Arab world. From Egypt, from Transjordan and from the North, with support of other Arab states, Palestine is invaded, as the United Nations look for ways to stop the war. Rage erupted out of Palestine and ignited in the streets of Iraq. The first thing that happened, when Israel won the war, the Iraqi government at the time was really against the Jews of Iraq, they were in a very difficult situation until 1950. In a punitive atmosphere, Jews were fired from government jobs and the people boycotted their shops. The Jews close their businesses, they do not dare to go to the streets. They hanged two Jewish people for Zionism and another two for Communism. So everyone understood that there was no way for us to live there. Money opened the doors. A deal funded by American Zionists, with sweeteners for the Prime Minister's family, allowed for the Jews to renounce their Iraqi citizenship, and leave. At first, the take up was slow. Some people didn't want to go, they had their jobs and their money and their houses. My parents were not Zionist, they were Jews. They… they pray. They have all the, whatever a Jew used to do in holidays and all and in the synagogue, they were not really Zionist. But then a series of bombs went off in Jewish districts of Baghdad. Although the government accused and then hanged two Zionists for doing it in order to drive emigration, no one believed them. Now they were afraid. "Oh, they are throwing bombs in the synagogue, so we have to move." So they went to register. All of them, 70,000, went to register in the synagogue. So we were about 120,000. The minute they closed the list of all those who wanted to go to Jerusalem, they confiscated all the money in the banks. All what you had, you can't sell anything, you can't sell your house, you can't sell, not even a pen. You know, and that's all. And we left Iraq with ten pounds. At long last, we have a country that they welcome us to come! They were happy to the sky. Throughout the summer of 1951, planes flew continuously from Baghdad to Tel Aviv, until 120,000 Iraqi Jews were carried away. But the welcome wasn't what they were expecting. Looking like creatures from the Arabian nights, it's a colourful sight, but scarcely a pretty one. A sort of weird costume ball unfolds in front of you, amusing, bizarre, pathetic. It was terrible. They considered us people who have no culture. Arabic culture does not exist. The… our language is the language of the enemy. They define us as Arab Jews. Black people. Some of these people may have been well-to-do or even wealthy, but you can't tell now, for they are all penniless. Basically, the messages came back, guys don't rush for God's sake. We rushed to this place and we are sitting in tents with a ration. In 1951, life for Edwin's family under the monarchy, was comfortable. No need to leave. Along with 7,000 well-off Jews, they stayed on. People have the opportunity to leave when the times are good. And when times are good, people don't want to leave. Full stop. Basically, when the times are bad, they always wish they had left when times were good. We were all gamblers and which gambler leaves while he was on a roll? Edwin has left the safety of the hotel to look for his childhood home. Now sandwiched between the notoriously violent Sadr City and the river. The area is controlled by a Shia militia. The taxi driver is nervous. I'm worried about coming here. It could go wrong. Allahu akbar. So this is the street where I grew up. Slowly, slowly, it's going to be on your left. Forwards, go forward, go forward, my friend. This white building, I don't know what it is. It's new. Ah, that's new. Because where we're supposed to be… That's the house! That's the house. This, this, this. Yes, yes, yes. Stop, stop, stop. Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Oh, my god. House for sale. I'll go and buy it! And this new building, it used to be a garden. And that garden, it used to have four nabug trees. And I came today to see the nabug. There's no nabug! When I saw the house, it hurt that you had to leave your own home like a criminal. It's difficult to put myself into that cauldron of boiling emotions. I'm the Jew who always lived here. It's a kind of a feeling of belonging. The Iraq Baghdad's Jews belonged to in the early '50s was booming. Unlike their cousins in tents outside Tel Aviv, their lives were good. Oil was flowing out and money was flowing in. Iraq had the first TV station in the Middle East, and a new consumer market to feed. The families of David Dangoor and David Shamash were riding the wave. My father built up so many businesses in Iraq. With his family or on his own? No, he took a Muslim partner, Ahmed Safwat. They set up a match factory together, a furniture factory, and they also got the concession for Coca-Cola for the whole of Iraq. When I should have been doing homework, my dad would take us to the office, which was in the commercial district of Baghdad. For a child, all the bright lights of the early evening, the new lit advertising hoardings for Kolynos toothpaste and Coca-Cola. My father was looking forward to a bright future. The army was strong, the economy was strong, the country was getting rich quickly. They could see no shadow at all in the horizon. My father was asked to represent the Jewish minority. He became an MP. I think he was quite well-off. In appearance, they wanted to have representations from the minorities. I'm sure the Christians also had MPs. They were trying to follow the British system, as much, although I think it was a one-party government. We had a lot of Muslim ministers coming to our house to have dinner and play cards. It was an open house. We used to get up in the morning, the coffees were being served and they were still playing cards. No, me, twice? No one. - Oh, you brought that card? - Sure, I did. Once, once, I said once. - You said twice. - And then I said, "No, once." - I am going to get it all back. - Hey! And the Iraqi Jews of London are still playing cards. This group meets once a week. I have always cheated for you. Danny Dallal grew up in a mixed neighbourhood of new Baghdad. There were three Jewish houses on our street but there was 30, 40 houses in the street. On our birthdays, I remember, we used to have all our neighbours over and there was Christians, there was Shi'as and, you know, lovely, lovely people, friends, real friends, proper friends. But everything, for all intents and purposes, is a Jewish surrounding. My dad was a director of a company and they imported tyres from Japan. My Uncle, Isaac, he used to have a factory, a chocolate factory. Now can you imagine having an uncle with a chocolate factory? I remember going with him, he took us to the factory and I have seen a bathtub full of chocolate. Even bigger than a bathtub. Just the… the drops that came out of the bathtub were this big, that much solid chocolate, umm, so that made him even more of a lovely uncle. I loved him an awful lot. ♪ Blue skies smiling at me ♪ There was a social revolution going on. Jews and Muslims were enjoying the same pleasures as the British and Americans. There were clubs there. You know, my uncle used to go regularly. It was a lot of fun. I mean, we were members of the Mansour Club, and there was another club called the Alwiya Club. These are clubs established, I would imagine, by the British, for the elite. You know, the Mansour Club had four tennis courts, and if you can afford it, you are just a member of these clubs. ♪ Shining so bright Never saw things going so right ♪ ♪ Noticing the days hurrying by ♪ You know the synagogue? Yes, I do. We used to walk from the synagogue and I'm trying to find another side turn that I know. We used to walk through on Saturdays and Holy Days. This is the turning? I can't really remember. I remember my grandfather was with me as we walked along here. And now we turn right. Edwin is still in his old neighbourhood, trying to find his family's synagogue. It's called Meir Tweg, and it's now the only maintained synagogue in Iraq. One moment. Go forward, go forward. Meir Tweg is still standing. When Saddam Hussein needed to please the Americans, he arranged for it to be preserved, but it's too dangerous for Jews to actually worship there. Baghdad was the centre of the Jewish world for over 1,500 years. They wrote the Talmud, the Babylonian Talmud. My ancestors put so much into Iraq. I can't live with the fact that my grandfather is buried here, and that we've abandoned him and we are just saying, "Goodbye Baghdad. Goodbye Meir Tweg. Goodbye everything", and we no longer even look back. Wild acclaim follows Egyptian President Nasser as he makes a publicappearance following his seizure of the Suez Canal. Seen by the fervently nationalistic… When Suez took place, my father could see that it was a momentous thing happening in the Middle East. It was the first time that Nationalism asserted itself. I remember he used to listen to the news day and night. He couldn't get away from it one minute. After Nasser seized the Suez Canal in 1956, the site of the defeated Western troops packing their bags polarised reactions. The women, I mean probably David Dangoor's mother and certainly my mother, were not happy. You could feel a kind of anxiety behind the sort of façade of easygoing life. Our house was on the riverfront and the Royal Palace was on the other side. We woke up to the sound of gunfire. It must have been… sort of first light. The radio came on announcing the army had taken over. Two years after Suez in 1958, the monarchy in Iraq was overthrown in a left-wing military coup. It had lasted 37 years. Veteran Premier Nuri al Said is deposed, he has fled and the Republican rebels have offered 10,000 pounds for his arrest. The crown prince is dead. Only one thing is certain. The Kremlin is jubilant. This is Abdul Karim Qasim, he was the leader of the revolt. The idea that the king should be replaced by a republic was something strange to us, and quite bewildering in some ways. Even though we knew very little about politics, we knew something cataclysmic was happening. I was three years old when the coup happened. Everybody rushed to the balcony to watch the Prime Minister of Iraq, Nuri Said. They tied his body to a car and just the usual Arab style revenge, would pull his body through the streets of Baghdad. I remember my mother, my grandmother screaming as the body was past through our… …and me, squeezing between them to see what was the commotion. King Faisal II and the Royal Family were gunned down, and the crown prince's mutilated body was displayed on the walls of the Ministry of Defence. The king used to be on the cover of our exercise books, and when we went back in September, all the exercise books had been reprinted. The original cover has been put on the inside now, and while it would be difficult to see, you can make out the figure of King Faisal II of Iraq. The cover has been reversed, and on the front, it has… "The schools of the Republic of Iraq." When the king had been brutally killed, my mother said, "I don't want to live in a country that can do this and drag their bodies through the street." My father had hoped to make his life in the land of his forefathers. He was… upset. In 1959, David's parents finally made the decision to leave Iraq. There were travel restrictions after the revolution. We went to Lebanon for a year, and after that year we came to England when we had finally got our entry permit. I never went back. After the revolution, we had to bring it down. We didn't want anybody to come and see we had the king hanged on the wall. We put it down, we wrapped it and put it away in a storeroom. My father had his work in Baghdad, and he never thought of leaving. We loved our country and we stayed there. Hello, Freddy! Ah, thank you. Freddy Khalastchy is Eileen's son. Four thousand Jews stayed after the 1958 Revolution. I asked Freddy what his family thought of the new leader, Kassem. He was really trying to help the poor people build new houses, build hospitals, and in the five years that he was in power, he did a lot. They decided to stay because things, more or less, were good. They didn't feel that they made a mistake. The first six months, we thought we are going to be communists. Now, every one want to learn about communism, we thought we are stuck, we are going to be communists. But David Khalastchi had a dealership selling fancy American cars. We have got about 70 or 80 cars. When the revolution came in, we thought, "Nobody will dare to ride in a big car, you want to go in a small car, otherwise, they will kill you." You cannot believe it, in six months, the government, they opened Embassies of the East, Russia embassy, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, China, and these people, they are starving for American cars. We couldn't dream we sell every car within a few months' time. We have got about 70, 80 cars. We sold all of them. The full prices. We have got the best five years of our life at that time. No difference between Muslims, Jewish, Christian with all the minority. This is Iraq for all Iraqi. The streets of ancient Baghdad become the scene of a short but decisive revolution that topples the pro-communist government of Premier Abdul Karim Kassem. In 1963, with the tacit support of the CIA, Kassem was killed in another coup by the Ba'ath Party, who included some old wartime fascists, and a young officer, Saddam Hussein. Israel was back as an issue and within weeks, Jewish passports were taken away. Our ID used to have a stamp on it saying "Jewish". This driving licence doesn't, it wasn't required. They stopped everybody for ID and this would come in very handy. You could be Christian, you could be anybody. So we used to produce it wherever we go in the street. We needed it just to, to kind of, hide our identity. I was lucky. I was really lucky that I left. In March, 12th of March 1967, I got a permit to leave. I was so pleased, I couldn't believe it. And then within a week, I left the country. And when I left, I have got all my partners, they are Muslims, and when I left, all of them, they came to the airport to tell me goodbye. And It was very, very sad feeling. My driver start to cry in the car, he say, "I hope you will come back." We have such a good relation. But it happen after three months. The June War had started, and the situation in Iraq for the Jews, it was undreamable, unthinkable. Everything changed in '67 when the Six-Day War started. I particularly remember coming home from school, my mum picked us up, panic in her face. The traffic was stopped by police, an army convoy with lots of soldiers holding their guns high. They were celebrating because they finally, I suppose the way they saw it, were going to liberate Palestine from Israel. They, they never called it Israel. They called it entity. Iraq was one of five Arab states fighting Israel in the Six-Day War in June 1967. The tension in the Middle East develops into full-scale war, with reports of heavy fighting between Israeli and Egyptian forces along the Gaza Strip and the Sinai border. I remember my brother distinctly saying, "You know, this is very bad for us." "If the Israelis win, then they're going to come back and take their revenge on us, and if the Israelis lose, well, we're all goners anyway." The Israelis won. And the consequences were immediate for the 2,000 Jews still living in Baghdad. People from the post office knocked on the door. I opened the door myself, and they asked me where the telephones are and I just took them. They pulled the cords from the wall, and took all the instrument and they said, "I'm sorry, but rules are rules. Jews are not allowed anymore the use of a telephone." We had many more visitors than we would normally have, because mum can't chat on the phone anymore. You know, we had very nice Muslim neighbours. They came and they say, "We give you the key of the house." "Whenever you want to use our telephone, come and use our telephone." We said, "No, thank you, we don't take a key, but nobody has a telephone, to whom shall we phone?" There's no one that we can phone. On the radio and on the television, you are portrayed as somebody who's sending messages to the enemy and what they call altamur kebarneh, the fifth column. My mother was placed immediately under house, house arrest. Luckily, she knew the chief inspector of police in Baghdad. He protected her. Two or three times, the inspector of police intercepted the order and tore it up. There was a lot of help from our Muslim friends. You had this feeling that all eyes were upon you all the time. We can't afford to look like Jewish kids out on the street. So in the street we start speaking Muslim. We used to change names, you don't call Mayer, that's a Jewish name, we are Jews, you don't do that. So we changed his name to Maher. We'd avoid sticking out, we'd avoid contact. In early 1969, the Ba'ath leadership laid on an event in response to the Six-Day War and its aftermath. Saddam Hussein, now deputy leader, was given the job of turning it into a national festival. They rounded up a number of people, mostly Jews, and they accused them of being spies for Israel and for the West. But when they said spies, I remember my dad's complexion changed. He… you know, he was, suddenly he said, "Uh-oh, that doesn't sound good." He knew that they probably meant the Jews. A show trial of the suspects was mounted in January. On the day of the trial, I remember we were petrified, all of us, because they said on the newspaper the day before that there was going to be some Jewish people in there, and suddenly we see them on television. The prosecution was demanding already the death sentence. We were all just watching television, the doorbell rings, and when the doorbell rings in the middle of the night, even though for me, even nine o'clock in the evening and for everybody, the door… there is no reason for that doorbell to ring unless it's trouble, and sure enough, it was my aunt saying, "Help, they've taken Isaac", my uncle. They had come to ask him to chat. The next day, there was a huge celebration in Baghdad's Tahrir Square. It's a national holiday, so there's no school and I just recall how happy, how deliriously happy we were. And they said that we should be listening to find out the great news that a spy ring was sentenced to death by hanging, and now the great Iraqi people are invited to rejoice. Even the president went. One who was under-age, he was 16 I think, they told him, if he says that he is 18, they will release him. So he believed them, he said he's 18 years old and then they hanged him all the same. We started recognising the people, of course, and my mother just started… started tearing her hair and screaming. The television was broadcasting the entire scene live. Every single day brought stories and brought hopes. No matter what we tried, no matter how we tried, we could not find out where he was. For me, it was like almost the end of the world. There was a continuous stream of disappearances and hangings. A few at a time, or in small groups, another 90 Jewish men vanished from their families. Then came news of Danny's uncle. It was a notice, like one of those adverts you sell an apartment. On the fifth page in a side column, "Isaac Dallal and his partner were found guilty yesterday of spying and they will be hanged tomorrow morning." I remember staying up all night just hoping… …hoping for an earthquake, something logical, you know, like an earthquake, another coup d'état… something. But of course it did happen, he was hanged, and even after that, nobody got to see his body. That was my turning point, I guess. There was only one thought, which is the same thing everybody had, one thought left, "Let's get out". Jews were not allowed to have passports so they couldn't leave the country. So there was no other option, just to flee. '70, '71, that year at school was the year you go into school every morning. You count and you look around who's left in your classroom. My mother, we had an idea that she was planning to run away, but not at all an adventurous person. Very insecure. She tried to keep herself occupied. She was making dolls of Iraqi men and women in costumes. At the time, I saw my parents as being guilty of having stayed. So the pressure of kids and, and their relationship with their parents, was huge. "Mum, when are we going?" Day in, day out, day in, day out. Huge pressure on parents. It tore families apart. Plans were to go on holiday, as such, to northern Iraq. It's beautiful, it's lovely. Once we're in the Kurdish areas, we're pretty much safe because they didn't have any animosity towards us. We knew that this was a proper way to escape. August '71, my father brought the family together, and told us that it's our turn. In two hours, we depart the house forever. My grandmother, she frantically was scrubbing every corner… and spent most of the two hours cleaning the house. Your home has to be your proof, your alibi that no, you were not trying to escape the country. You would leave it exactly like you were coming back in about an hour or two. They close the door, and they go. They don't tell anybody, just in case. You do not tell your closest friend. Just in case they spread the word, and then they would be caught. There was no doubt, it was definitely a question of life or death. We had to go through various checkpoints, you try to be cool and calm and pretending that you are on holiday and you're jolly. And you're looking around at your sisters who are younger and your grandmother who is praying loudly and… Is it possible that this soldier wouldn't suspect this family that look like, you know, Jewish, they look frightened. Come darkness, we got on a Jeep and there was a friend of mine, a classmate of mine who appeared out of nowhere sitting in front of me. We think we have it all planned, and we know what's happening but here we are in a, in a car with a total stranger. You know we've never met this guy, he is, after all, a smuggler. This is a dangerous situation. They were driving all night, east, through the mountains and you could see lights on the hills, you know, indicating the route. There were loads of people in the car, seven or eight people, so when we crossed the border between Arab Iraq and Kurdish Iraq and the guy turned around and said, "You're okay now, you've made it," it was just… it was amazing. We knew that we, we were free and we were just ecstatic. Once they have escaped, you couldn't communicate with them, no. The person in charge, he comes back with a message. The message is half the dinar that they took with them. They leave one half with the people in Baghdad, so we know that they arrived safely. Did you think of trying to escape? No. We were afraid to do that. The Jewish community was now down to a few hundred. The Ba'ath Party's attention drifted elsewhere. Eleven years after Eileen's passport had been taken away, her application for a new one suddenly went through. We closed the door. We had our suitcases with us. We went to a friend's house and the next morning, we went to the airport and left. Eileen arrived in London on the 18th of December 1974, leaving 280 Jews in Baghdad. Once you leave the country and don't return within three months, then all your property is confiscated. - And you lose your nationality. - And you lose your nationality. You're not considered Iraqi any more. Three months. This is a miniature of the Tigris. In 2003, Iraq was once again invaded. An Anglo-American alliance wanted to be rid of Saddam Hussein. And a wisp of the past rose from the conflict. My father was interviewed on the eve of the war. They asked him for some photos, and this was one of the ones he gave. My mother winning Miss Baghdad 1947. An Iraqi newspaper in Britain picked up this picture, they coloured it in a little, giving her a yellow sash and an orange-pink dress, and they published it with a sort of wistful commentary underneath, saying…. "Baghdad used to be a city of peace and tolerance where people enjoyed calmly drinking their coffee, strolling with ease, retiring at night with confidence and waking up in the morning with a new hope. People were really living the good life." Now, my mother appears in about two and a half thousand websites. She's become a symbol of what they see as the best days of Iraq. I'm going to meet Edwin in northern Iraq. He is buying his house in Erbil, the capital of the Kurdish area. He wanted to join the last five Jews still living in Baghdad, but it's too dangerous there, which is not to say Erbil is safe. Islamic State's front line is just a short drive from Erbil's city centre. I stayed the course so far. And in spite of the incredible fantasy of it all, so far, so good. - Hello, good morning. - Hello, good morning, sir. Hello, hello, hello. How are you? Honoured to meet you. - What shall we speak? Arabic or English? - Arabic or English is fine. It's a heightened sense of living. It's a, it's a kind of a fear mixed with excitement, mixed with belonging. No matter what the danger is, the mind adjusts itself and so did I. But, yes, I have to deal with it, like everybody else is dealing with it. Allah! I love you! I love you and I love everyone who loves you… We would like to encourage people to come to Iraq, to this complex, specifically, and to this region. Edwin's on his way to see the house that he bought off plan. Now, he owns a piece of Iraq. Wow! I bought this house. It is a step in my dream. You know what? Maybe, just maybe, in 30, 40, 50, 60 years' time, Jews, would reconnect with their birthplace. It could die with me. But If I don't see my dream in my lifetime, at least I know I set it in motion. Of course, I'm longing for the, for the river there, I'm longing for Baghdad, my Baghdad. And you mourning for that, it is so natural. But you don't go there. I don't want to go back. There's a lot of people who left Baghdad in the good times, so they have a nice, nostalgic memory of it. I know that my memory is just marred by loss of my uncle. Iraq is still in our blood, in our bones. It's like a distant bell ringing in the back of our heads, always reminding us where we came from. I still miss Baghdad. I wouldn't like to go now because it's all in ruins. The places I know are not the same. So it's better to remember everything as it is. - Or as it was. - As it was, sorry. I was dreaming.
