THE ISLAND OF THE DINOSAURS I'm sure you know that the Zoological Studies Society completely rejected my theory. I have even been mocked by my colleagues. Usually we men of science only want to believe what we see through our microscopes or what we can prove or measure with our test tubes. I mean. we need proof. Well, with this proof, I want to demonstrate that my theories are correct. I insist, and always will, that there is a fabulous island that the ancient authors located close to Morocco, in the strait of Wales, some a little more to the West. Atlantis. Exactly. That's a name that geologists gave to a region of the Atlantic that belonged to the Tertiary Age. And what are you going to do to prove your theory, Professor? Come closer. I'll explain it to you. I prepared this map. As you see, here's North America, South America, Africa. and Spain. Well, I want to form an expedition to Atlantis, for which I ask the help of my... former students. But according to the stories, Atlantis disappeared suddenly due to a cataclysm. Not entirely. The island was divided into several parts and formed the Madeira Islands, the Canary Islands, and the Azores. But there are overlooked islets that didn't go to the bottom of the ocean. If my estimates are correct, in that part of Atlantis that still exists, we will find animal life. What kind of life? Plants and... prehistoric animals. But... that's fantastic. Yes. That's why I believe that the presence of a zoologist would be important for the expedition. And there's nobody better than you, Pablo, with all your fossil discoveries. Rocks and minerals are the biography of a continent, and you, Laura, with your brilliant studies, have a Ph.D. in mineralogy. Dr. Esther would study the chemistry of the place. She has made important contributions to this science. Well, that's all. Now decide if you want to come with me on this adventure that many people believe is the product of an unbalanced mind. I tell you, you're free to say no, because we may encounter many dangers. You can count on me. Professor. It will be an honor to go with you. - We'll succeed together, Professor. - Thank you. Thank you very much. I knew what the answer would be. Okay, let's see. now. We'll go by boat directly to Bermuda. From there. we'll continue by airplane until we find the remains of Atlantis. Is there something wrong? We're losing altitude. There's a clearing down there. I'll try a forced landing. Fasten your seat belts. Watch out! - Are you guys okay? - I think so. - Are you sure? - I'm fine. - And you, Laura? - Yes. - Bring the cognac. Pablo. - Okay. Professor. Here it is. Did you check the plane, Professor? Yes, it's not too damaged. - Will you be able to fix it? - I hope so. Now let's do what's most urgent: let's eat. I wonder where we are. I haven't the faintest idea. The storm damaged the instruments and diverted us. This is so quiet and deserted. Allow me. What was that? It seemed like lightning. Do you think there are people around here? Well, this will be our home for a while. It's not a five-star hotel, but [ like it. - Did you bag anything? - Nothing. But I discovered something very important. There's a river close by. I thought you would be happy to hear the news. Of course. Water means a bath. - Do you want to come? - Let's go. Okay. in the meantime, we'll work on the plane. Come, Laura. Come. Laura! Don't go too far. It could be dangerous! Look. That volcano could erupt someday. Look. What do you think, Laura? - About the age of this place? - Yes, how old do you think it is? Professor. Prehistoric. I wonder if this islet is part of Atlantis. Yes, but... how can we know for sure? Do you have enough, Laura? For the preliminary analysis. I wonder what's on the other side. Mala! Mala! Mala! Ah! Ah! Buko! Buko! Radiation-- 10 percent over the normal reading. The tests of the liquids are also abnormal. Temperature: 78 degrees. Pressure: 13.8 per inch. Although the tests are not conclusive, they indicate that human and animal life, like elsewhere on Earth, may coexist in this place. What was that noise? I don't know. It seems like a roar. This valley horrifies me. I sometimes think that we've landed in a strange world... unknown... and that a terrible danger is threatening us. Don't be so pessimistic, Esther. The landing gear was the most damaged. I already checked the engine. Fortunately. it didn't suffer any damage. - We were lucky. - Yes. We'll patch the right wing with one of the parachutes. Okay. It's hot. Let's go cool down at the river. I'll come as soon as I finish this report. Help me get out of here. I have to find my camp. Help me! A monster! Help me! A monster! Banda. Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! Professor, I'm worried about Laura. She went to the river a while ago, and she hasn't come back yet. Let's look for her. It will be dark very soon. Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! Laura! Laura!! Where are you? Answer us! Look. She must be around here. Laura! Laura!! She's not anywhere. Maybe she drowned. No, I don't think so. The river is shallow around here. Then where can she be? Thank you...for protecting me. I said, thank you for protecting me. I'm Laura. Laura. Do you understand? I am Laura. Lau...Lau... - Yes, Laura. - Lau-ra. Here. Me, Laura. You? Molo. Molo. Stop it. I'm very cold. I'm going inside. Yes, I'm hungry. And I'm very cold. I'm glad you understood. Thanks for the dress. I don't know what animal that is, but... I'm so hungry, it's sure to taste like chicken. Can't I take part in your feast? I'm hungry. Look. Molo. Look what I made for you. With this, you'll be able to defend yourself and kill animals. Look. Banda. Banda. What's that, Molo? Is it for me? I guess it's to warn about danger, or something like that. Thanks. Molo. Take me to the river. To the river. To the river. My colleagues are there. To the river! Wait for me! We've been looking for her for three days, and we haven't found her. My God. Poor Laura. If she's alive, who knows what danger she's in. Don't worry, we'll find her. She can't disappear just like that. I had the feeling something was going to happen. - And now... - Stop tormenting yourself, Esther. It's late. Let's go back to the camp. Tomorrow we'll continue the search. Kuchak. Misha. Misha? Misha. Molo. She's your mother, right? I told you to take me to the river, not to bring me to your people. You're the worst man I know. You know what. Molo? Your eyes have the color of the mountain. I'd love for you to come to my country and dress like us. You'd be very successful with girls. But they would ruin you. I like you a lot. Molo. I think I'm beginning to love you. I love flirting with a guy who doesn't understand me... who doesn't even know what a kiss is. A kiss. Yes. A kiss. Kiss. Yes, kiss. But don't say it again. No, Molo! No, Molo! Molo! Molo! - Your backpack. - Thank you. We have to find Laura this time. I know she's here somewhere. And where do you think you're going now? We'll explore the south side until we reach the mountain. Where those strange roars are coming from? Yes. I'm concerned about the route you're going to take. It will be the last time we try, Professor. And what if we don't find Laura? Then, may God be with her. We'll leave without her... if she's still alive. The plane is ready. I'll come with you guys. No, you can help us better from here, Professor. Tomorrow at 10, throw flares every 15 minutes. That could guide us back in the event we get lost. Okay, Pablo. - Ready? - Yes. Be careful! Banda! Banda! Kuchak! Kuchak! Molo! Sasta! Sasta! What a deserted place. That sounds like the roar of an animal. I still think it's lightning. Do you want to go back? - No. we have to keep going. - Okay. Oh, my God! There's a cave there! Let's go! It doesn't work! Pablo. what should we do? I don't know. I don't know. I wouldn't believe it if I weren't seeing it. Me neither. This is our chance. Let's go. I have to go, Molo. I can't stay here. Take me to the river. The volcano. It's going to erupt. Kuchak. Look! Did you see that light? It means my friends are looking for me. Take me to them, Molo. Oh, Molo. I don't want to leave you. How I wish you could understand that. But now... I have to go. Go. Yes. I have to go. Don't look at me that way. Because then... I won't be able to leave you. Take me to my colleagues. Believe me... I'll always have you in my heart. All of you have been very good to me. We have to get to the plane. Let's go! Look! - Laura! - Esther! Who is he? Molo. A caveman. Come. Molo! And are you thinking about taking him? Yes. You have to leave him. He belongs to this world. He needs me. Professor, will there be another earthquake? No, it already reached its maximum level of intensity. The island is safe. - Let's go. Laura. - Come, Laura. let's go. I can't leave him! I can't leave him! Molo. I love you. I'll stay with you forever. Kuchak. THE END The people involved in the making of this film belong to the S.T.P.C. of RM.
