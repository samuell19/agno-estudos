Knit one, purl one Go 15 rows and reverse Knitting in the garden in the morning I call profiting from your holidays For my husband it's fishing... he went out at 5 this morning Don't you worry about him catching cold Good morning ladies Good morning monsieur Monsieur?... Moisy "Moisy" Silly old bats. Would it bother you if I took the paper? Not at all Madame. What do you think about it Monsieur Albert? About what? The Rue Picpus murder. I'm not interested in mystery novels. It's not a novel The most desirable life is the one that nothing happens to. However, Monsieur Albert, you give the impression of a full life. Yesterday you got a letter and two telegrams. And you were asked for 3 times on the 'phone. Is this spying? It's interest. Did I answer the phone or read the letters? No. So what do you make of that? You are not a curious person. I leave that to others. Monsieur Albert... please come! What is it? A registered letter. Excuse me. One could imagine he has problems of the heart. What? A registered letter. Has nothing registered with you? But Monsieur Maigret... Don't call me that. Yes, Inspector... Again?! It's you... Monsieur Maigret, Police Inspector? Me? Yes. The one they talk about in the newspapers? It's a letter from headquarters. You're barking up the wrong tree... I travel in braces. It's a useful and moral profession... I keep men's trousers on. OK It's an order for braces from a bicycle dealer. But I won't deal with them. This is what I think of their letter. Here's 5 francs to drink to my health. Thank you Monsieur. What a mess-up! Yes Inspector. Yet again!? It just slipped out. I honour your house with my presence on one condition: No one must know who I am or what my name is. May I see your license Monsieur? What licence? Your fishing licence. For catching fish? Because although I'm fishing, I'm not catching anything. Do you have your licence, yes or no? I must have left it at home. Like all of them who never had one. And your ID? No, for the same reason. No ID either? Perfect! Perfect?... so now we're both happy! Your name? I?m not going to tell you. You're making things worse for yourself. If you knew who you were talking to, you wouldn't be so happy. It's all the same to me if you're the Pope! You'd be excommunicated. In the meantime... come over here! Come on, you! My God, you're making things bad for yourself! Come here! 'Ullo! 'ullo! 'ullo! I seem to have arrived just in time. Hands up! Police! He doesn't have a fishing licence. He'll be taken into custody... don't you worry about it. I've been after him for a long time. Guilty of assuming the identity of Inspector Maigret. Come aboard. I submit to your violence. I come on board under protest. Take it easy! 'bye... My pleasure. Thanks Lucas. Now piss off! Don't send me back, Chief! I just want some peace and quiet. It's a sensational case! I don't give a stuff! haven't you ever been tired? Nobody's indispensable. You're wasting the best days of your life. This is no ordinary case. The murder on Rue de Picpus They need you... the Boss said: If you can't find Maigret Armadieu'll take the case. He'll screw it up! And how he'll screw it up! I shan't mention the wardrobe and how it was opened And what was inside. It was most impressive. What "wardrobe"? I won't bother you with it. Are you going to come out with it? Not here... bad sea-legs! You want an armchair? I've got the car. Where? In front of the guesthouse. Let's go then. Let's resume the story. So... yesterday 11.30 at 53 Rue Durantin 4th-floor tenant Jeanne Dumont is moving out. The removal guys leave to go to lunch. She leaves the place for good... ...and goes to lunch in a small local restaurant. and by 2pm she's arrived at Rue de Picpus and her new apartment, where she waits for the removalists. What is she... this woman? 40 years old, not stupid. Someone who knows more than she lets on. Profession? Dressmaker. Go on. By mid afternoon, everything?s moved. 6.15 the job's finished. Jeanne Dumont wants to open the wardrobe in her bedroom. But the wardrobe?s locked. Key can't be found. One of the moving guys helps her with his pocket knife. The door was opened. It was most impressive. The inquiry? The usual. The victim? Nobody knows. Description? 1.65, blond blue-grey outfit, sheer stockings, worn shoes, no ID and no handbag. "No handbag"? That's weird. And the autopsy? Dr Pierre arrived in black tie and a bad mood. He was on his way to the opera. Stabbed in the nape of the neck. What's Armadieu got to say? The usual. For him, everyone?s a suspect: Jeanne Dumont because it's her place, and the removalists who've carried the body. So we need to find: Who is the woman? When was she killed? When was the body put there? At Rue de Picpus or at Rue Durantin? Where are we going? We'll start at Rue Durantin. Murders are always way up on the top floors... and no elevator. What are you saying? Mum always told me this job would be hard on shoes. This is it? Straight ahead. G'day Monsieur Maigret. G'day Janvier Your losing your hair. Soon you'll be a very polished policeman! Armadieu. I thought you were on holidays. I was called back. You've been bothered for no reason. No reason? The case is a simple one. With our old methods we've succeeded without your flashes of intuition. You're going to make me give up smoking. I'm going to take care of it all the same. You're so fulla yourself! I'll take up from where you got to. So... is there anything new? Not much. Out of 16 possible missing persons not one matches. Her photo's in the papers? Yes. And the autopsy? Dr Pierre is there. I'm going ahead with a reconstruction. May I...? Yes You want something? No. What are you doing there. I was about to knock. You were listening at the door? No, but I could hear. Your attitude is suspect. You have something to say to us? Yes. What's your name? Louis Dubief Profession? Writer. I don't know the name. My Pen name is Arnaud de B?darieu. Ah... right on! And so...? So, yesterday, towards lunchtime I passed a woman on the stairs to the 2nd floor who answered the description of the victim. What were you doing there? I live on the 2nd floor. What time was it 12.30 You noted the time? The lady asked me the time. She had no watch? No. Well, Monsieur Arnaud de... De B?darieu. Make yourself available for questioning. Where about's... the morgue? What do you prefer... the Opera? I'd prefer the morgue. More fascinating. You can go. You know him He's a novelist. My wife reads him. She better lend them to you. So according to the testimony of the haggard novelist, at 12.30 the victim was still alive. We forgot to ask him if his watch kept good time. Isn't he the one! G'day, Dr Pierre. Any results? They're short. Amadieu has them. The woman was killed around 12.30... ...stabbed in the nape of the neck. The spinal cord was reached... done with force. By a man? Not necessarily. An enraged woman can be very strong. If you'd only seen my wife last night... She's waiting for me to dine. Can't work without eating. 'bye Doctor... enjoy your meal. You see... we've come to the same conclusions. The murder has taken place here. According to the statements Madame Dumont had been gone for an hour. There was no one here. Yes Chief, there was the killer that nobody saw. That doesn't let off the removalists. I wouldn't give up on getting a confession out of them. Robbery with murder. They were moving stuff... someone turned up... they struck Motive: theft... we haven't found a handbag Who could have taken it apart from the removalists. What has the concierge had to say. She knows nothing. She wasn't there. Her husband? Not there either. But he's a sergeant in the Bicycle Brigade With a handlebar moustache. I know the type. During this time he was out fining cyclists. Fingerprints? Nothing interesting. Those of Madame Dumont and the removalists. The killer seems to have benefited from a remarkable set of circumstances. Nobody's seen him.. maybe they have. You have an idea? Whadda you think? I'm looking. What's he doing? Is he spying on us? If you happen to own a window, you get to look out of it. I'll go and ask him if he's seen anything You're just brimming with great ideas! I've got an idea that's most impressive. Another one...? The killer?s a woman. Why? Oh... please slow down. I didn't understand a word. Because a man carrying a woman's handbag would have been noticed. Maybe. We haven't found the weapon or the wardrobe key, or the bag. They've all disappeared at the same time. There's another possibility... that the woman came here without a handbag Which do you believe? I don't believe... I think. Arnadieu is over there, Chief. Hey! He's dead! Dead? Gunshot! Some time ago. I don't believe Dr Pierre will get to have his dessert. Don't move Armadieu! I have an idea. Most impressive. Follow me, Lucas. What are you doing? I'm reconstructing the crime. Amadieu! Can you se me? Yes! There was a witness but he can't talk. A dead shot. Most impressive. Someone's at the door, Chief. See who it is. Good day. What do you want? We heard there was an apartment for rent. We came right up. You aren't frightened of ghosts? No. I murder doesn't bother you? It'll be the talk of the office. Just change the wallpaper... some painting.. So look around, kids. Thank you Monsieur. Charming... not very emotive, but charming. You're wrong. The guy over there saw nothing. He couldn't have seen anything. Why? He was blind. He spent his days listening to the sounds of the street. The killer didn't know that. That mischance will not make the killer happy. How big's our desk? I don't know. People here. Yes... and alive and kicking. We've scarcely left this world when we're replaced. Yes, change the wallpaper. But not here, kiddies. You like the sun? Sure. There'll be an apartment across the way becoming available. With a better aspect than this. And with an elevator "The Picpus Case" "The Picpus Case" "Strange Murder" "The Tragic Wardrobe' "The Blind Man who Sees the Murderer" I've been a journalist in my time. I know the ropes. We missed the morning papers but not the afternoon. The rest of the country will follow suit. They'll drag up the cases of Weidmann, Bonnot and Landru. The cabaret singers'll send us up and we'll be the laughing-stock of the town. Hullo... what? Who's handling the case... why? Have him wait. No... send him up to Maigret's office Maigret's handling the case. Since right now! I had a good lead. The removal guys? You should have asked if there was a champion marksman amongst them. What are you laughing at? There's nothing to be gained by squabbling. Maigret's methods may be fanciful but they work. Anadieu's have had their chance. Don't waste time. Someone's waiting for you. A bag-snatcher? I don't know. Why? What do you believe? I don't believe anything. Crime of passion, Boss What The killer must have promised the victim something to get her into the wardrobe. Forever evil-minded... ...fat and stupid You have a strange way of choosing your assistants. Come on, Lucas I've got a narcotics case for you... a stupefying one. G'day... you wanted to see me? Are you handling the Picpus case? Yes. Inspector Maigret. Inspector Maigret? The newspapers didn't mention you. You're suspicious. I got back in town this morning. Pleased to make your acquaintance Monsieur Maigret. Pleased that it's you who's handling this case. I've brought you some sensational information. A question of life and death. I'm a miserable wretch. - Sit down. - Thank you. - What time is it? 3.45 There's not a minute to lose. Where was I up to? You were a miserable wretch. I'm a thief. I've come to give myself up. You've stolen a handbag? No. I've stolen 1000 francs from my boss. 100 francs? That's not much. It's the intention that matters. In for a penny in for a pound. And you murdered your mother. You must understand... a gambling debt is a debt of honour. So you've been turned into a thief? Yes. So arrest me. I can't see what this has to do with my murder case. So it might seem... no here... What is it? A blotting-paper place-mat So I see. Read it. "Today, Friday at 6pm I will kill the clairvoyant" Signed: "Picpus" I found it at the Caf? de la Nef on Place Clichy. As you can see there's not a minute to lose. We'll do this by the book. Sit down. Thank you Monsieur. What's your name? Mascouvin. First name? Honor?. Honoured, I'm sure. Profession? I'm at a business agency on Rue Grenata. Every day I have a coffee at the Caf? de la Nef And I go home on Rue Biot every day for lunch. Today I asked for something to write on, because I was racked with guilt. "With guilt"? Yes, my theft of 1000 francs. I wanted to write to my boss then give myself up for prison. So the waiter brought me a blotting-paper mat I must point out that I'm short-sighted. very short-sighted. So I've taken off my glasses, like this to wipe them clean. I've placed them like that on the piece of paper. And I see reflected and enlarged by the lens of my glasses "I will kill... Picpus" I then set about reading the rest of the sentence. "Today, Friday at 6pm I will kill the clairvoyant" Signed: Picpus Luckily I'd read the papers. I saw the connection and came straight here. Tell me old boy, have you read the papers? You never read the papers? There's an interesting article in Paris-Soir There may be no connection. Yellow press? Read it just the same. I'll have it sent over to you. Thanks. What's this now? Come in! G'day Monsieur Maigret. It's the Paris-Soir Let's see now... Are you screwing with me?!! Me? You've talked to the papers. Look! That must be the journalist. What? When I read that there was a customer sitting beside me. I was rather upset by what I'd read And I couldn't help showing it to him. He seemed interested and told me he was a journalist. he wanted to take the piece of paper to do a story. But I wouldn't let him. Just a second... Get me Larsier on the crime-desk at Paris-Soir Go on. Where was I? What time is it 4pm There's not a minute to lose Paris-Soir That you Larsier? G'day old boy... Maigret here. No, I got back this morning. I've taken over the case. I'm going to have your balls!... Did you dig up this sensational bit of information in a bistro on Place Clichy called -La Nef. La Nef... N, e, f You ate at Palestrino's? The 'Scallops Milanaises' are always good. Lucky bastard. But just how did you come by this? Mall-tube? Send a courier with what you got for identification. I'll pay you back. Thanks. Believe that... and pigs might fly. What? My dear Monsieur Mascouvin I ask myself... does your journalist actually exist? It wasn't Larsier. I don't know if... It came through the pneumatic mall-tube just as they were going to press. He had just enough time to change the lead story What did your journalist look like? Let me think back... he was I'll picture him.. now I see him. He had a sports jacket, a small grey hat, American-style moustache and a gold tooth. Gold tooth?... Pretty good for someone so short-sighted. Yes, people often say that. Boss, I have an idea... a most impressive idea. It's Picpus himself that Monsieur Mascouvin's described Picpus? Yes. "Signed: Picpus"... the killer Whadda you reckon? Nothing. It's possible His insistence on wanting to take the compromising placemat. Maybe. Shoe him in. It's the courier. He was quick. Tell old Goujon in research to come over. What time is it? 4.10 Already! It's you, the sprint-cyclist. You must have stopped for nothing. It's from Monsieur Larsier. I know what it is. Inspector Maigret? No, he's not here. He's sleeping. Sleeping? Isn't that the inspector? What do you ride? An Alcyon. Racing-bars, derailleur-gears and all the caboodle? You're a connoisseur. I know bikes. One of these days I'll challenge you. Did you park it in the yard? Be careful, people in this place'd pinch anything. No reply. No G'day Monsieur Goujon Maigret. May I present Monsieur Mascouvin, a brother in shortsightedness. Come with me. Where? In front of the mirror. What do I look at? This message. "Today Friday at 6pm I will kill the clairvoyant. Signed Picpus" Is this a joke? No. And this one. "Today Friday at 6pm" Is this what you got me here for? They're the same. The original and it's imprint. The mold and the cast. Try and find some interesting things about them. What are you going to do? I don't know what at the moment. I can't put a watch on every clairvoyant. I don't have enough officers. And if the murder takes place what will the press say You don't know? No. That it was preventable! What? To know that a murderer is going to kill and... Wait. I know. Listen... If I may dare... Dare away! I'd ask you to come with me to the bistro. On site, you might get an idea. An idea which might save a woman's life. Let's go there then. Shall I come? No. Go to Lost and Found... See if there are any handbags of interest. And see if you can establish any pickpocket activity at the time. G'day Monsieur Honor? There... that's where I sat. Sit down. What would you like? A half. Waiter! A half. And for Monsieur. Another half. Wait a moment. Do you remember serving this man earlier? Monsieur Honor?? Your statement is most important. This gentleman is from the police. My dream! In Toulon one time after completing my service I wanted to join the police force, but I met Marquita. She was a barmaid. Then I followed the trade. But the vocation's still with me. And the eye, too What did you serve him earlier. A coffee. And after? Another coffee. No.. you gave me something to write on. That's right. He was alone? Yes. No... he wasn't alone. I remember now. Try and recall, Fernand. There was a man sitting near me in a sports jacket. I remember him! I recall now... you were talking together. What about? I never listen! With a moustache a hat and a gold tooth? That's it. And you remember me? Yes. Where was I sitting? Over there? That's it! Thanks, Fernand Did I answer well? Very well. Bring me one of the place mats you gave him. Easy... the same as that one there. Be sure to tell the truth. Please don't draw on the tables. Meanwhile, fetch the middies. Apart from the pleasure of sharing a drink with you, This little exercise has achieved nothing. Why ask for the placemat? - Just a formality to check the fingerprints. But I don't believe in Santa Claus. What time is it? 5.15 Might I suggest something? Suggest-away. Turn around. And then read: "Sheila, clairvoyant" Maybe it's her. You can't read it? No, it's too small. 53 Rue Durantin, would you believe? Yes. Two halves fresh from the tap. No time to drink them. Keep the change. And your place-mat? Give it to him. See me tomorrow. You're not arresting me? Would you feel safer out of sight? Perhaps. Go and wait for me at my office. What time is it? 5.20 No time to lose. See you later. 'Bye Fernand. Regards to Marquita. Oh... she went off with a tenor ages ago. Are you the concierge? No Monsieur. You may be able to tell me if there's a clairvoyant here? I'm sorry, I don't know. A bit of advice though... why are you wasting your time? Why look for the truth from clairvoyants? Truth is within you... and it's through Zarathustra that you'll find it. I thank you very much! I'm looking for the concierge. You want me. Good afternoon Madame. The apartments been rented. I wanted to see Madame Sheila the clairvoyant. Sheila? She left. She left? Where to? She moved out yesterday. I thought that was Madame Dumont. You're very inquisitive. That's my job. She did Tarot cards eh? The Man of Law... that's me. Police... because not everybody can be a bicycle courier. So!?... Madame Dumont and Madame Sheila are one and the same. But just "Sheila"...sounds smarter. Madame Dumont was a clairvoyant? I thought she was a dressmaker. That too. In one of the big-name couturiers. But she has a future. People liked her Amadieu wasn't on the ball not learning about this. Pardon? Nothing. 5.30 and Rue de Picpus is at the other end of town. Ha something happened to her? Rue de Picpus and step on it. Don't stop for anything. "Today, Friday at 6... Madame Dumont please. 5th... left. Again? You again? What are you doing here? Are you coming or going? I was going. I'd been ringing for 5 minutes. What time is it? 6.05. What were you doing here? I had an appointment. With Sheila? You know? Yes. Too late. Are you thinking what I'm thinking? Yes Are you going to force the door? No I'm better than that. Did you see anyone? No. Come with me. He.... confessed. Confessed... who confessed? Hey... down there! Wait there! Get a move on! Where are you going? Stay here. Stabbed in the nape of the neck like the other one. Come in! Whadda you want? First off, speak to me politely. Don't get smart with me. Whadda you want? Monsieur Maigret. He's not here. I've got a package for him. A package? A handbag. Nicked? Not since I'm returning it. Thanks Don't thank me. I've nothing in common with you. It's only because it's Maigret's case. Otherwise I'd have tossed it in the river. Calm down... where'd you nick it? Lamarck metro station. Lamarck? What time? Midday. You recognize her That's her. Don't touch anything. Have you phoned? Are they coming? Dr Pierre should already be here. Guard him for me. Dining room 10 by 10... kitchen Nothing. Cupboards... That's the kitchen. What's this? Who's there? It's me chief. Not you, you idiot... in here. Take it easy. Open the door! I'm locked in. Shall I fetch a locksmith? No. What are you doing there? Who are you? Are you deaf? No. Your ID? My ID? Gently with him... you can see he's old. You can go back to your position. Yves Le Cloaguen... Doctor. That's you? Yes. Yves de Cloaguen... marine doctor... retired. A sawbones? Why not? What are you doing here? Me? I'm crazy. - Playing the comic doesn't impress me. - Me neither. No, I'm really crazy. You know what's happened? Madame Dumont's been killed? Sheila the clairvoyant. Jeanne? Jeanne? She's dead? No. What were you doing? Hang on. My memory's like venetian blinds... ...there are holes. Ah yes... I was coming to see her. I rang twice...then Then she pushed me into the kitchen and told me to wait. Then she locked the door. And I smoked a cigarette. Where's the butt? Where do you live? Boulevard des baitignolles. It's written there. Number 136. Live alone? No. With your wife? Yes Was she aware of your visits to Madame Dumont? No. We'll call you a kid caught in the act. You're free to go. The doctor's arrived. Show him in. I'll take you home. To my place? Well certainly not to the Pope's. I hope you weren't eating. Isn't she dead? I want you to examine the wound. Stabbed in the back of the neck like the other one. May I present a colleague.. Dr Le Cloaguen. Pleased to meet you. Excuse me... I'm crazy. The crazier you are, the happier you are. Of course! Try and find the murder weapon Pardon me... What? Can I go home? No. We'll take you home. He's a bit nuttier than you but not much. Is this it? I don't know. You're home and you don't recognize it? My God, are you scared of something?- Pay no attention... I'm crazy. Not so much... What floor are you on? 5th. No elevator of course? No. Let he who is without sin cast the first stone. This is it? Yes Don't pull such a face You aren't at the police station. You're at home. What is... it? I've brought the doctor home. An accident? No. Police. Jesus! Is that your wife? No it's Marie. The maid. Yes. What are you doing? The parquet floor. What's this about? You're police? Inspector Maigret. A murder has been committed at a clairvoyant?s. We found your husband locked in the kitchen. She's not dead is she? What were you doing there? Answer when the man questions you. I wasn't questioning. I was just relating the facts. A clairvoyant? I don't know. You don't know! Offer the gentleman a glass of port. You drunkard! You finished it off! Step forward. Open your mouth. You've been smoking again! Tobacco is poison! Go to your room! Very well. He needs authority. I'd like to see his room. Please... The poor man is quite incapable. I beg your pardon. This is your bedroom? It's my cabin. Port! Starboard! Ready about! Hard rudder! Full steam ahead! Stop! Were you a doctor or a captain? Me? I'm crazy. That yours? No. No pipe? No...I abhor tobacco! She's not dead? No. Let him rest Monsieur... Maigret... Come into the lounge. We'll be more comfortable. You can't hurry him. Let me make it clear... I'll get the truth about this clairvoyant. Please sit down. Perhaps you know something already? Me? I got the impression when I was telling what happened that you were expecting something worse. You never know with him. It's been hard for me... A young woman, full of dreams... and then the inconsistency of seamen, and then the opium. He had a heart attack. You see what's left of him. A poor crazy person. But never a bad man. What is it now? It's Attorney Laignan. What have I been hearing about? The Police? Monsieur.... Inspector Maigret. Laignan, Attorney... passing through Paris. Lawyer to the Le Cloaguen family Nothing serious I hope? I hope not. Sit down. Can you imagine Yves getting mixed up in such a drama as this? He was locked in a room at a clairvoyant's. Why...I'll ignore. The clairvoyant has been killed and my poor Yves is a suspect. Let me tell you that my old friend Yves Le Cloaguen in incapable of such a deed. I'm sure you'll find him innocent. Since fortune has brought us together perhaps we could have a word in private? Am I not wanted? No Madame... ...but if you have something else to do, now would be a good time. What's their situation... ...their finances? Excellent. Every year I forward them an annuity of 200,000 francs. These visits to them are a holiday for me... a chance to enjoy Paris... always so lively. I fear, alas... What is this annuity? You don't know the story? You haven't had time to learn about it. Quite a romantic story. Cigarette? I only smoke a pipe. - 25 years ago, Le Cloaguen was doctor on board a passenger ship in the China seas. A yellow fever epidemic broke out on board He was totally devoted to the task and has stopped the outbreak in its tracks May I? Notably, he saved the life of a rich Argentine woman, named Lopez Diaz. And in recognition of that, her father who had a fertilizer business, has bequeathed Le Cloaguen an annuity of 200,000 francs. Nobody ever smokes here. That's all they have for an ashtray. He retired to the country, but after his heart attack which affected him badly, they've come and set up in Paris. And your opinion as to the murderer? I say again, He's not capable of such a dark deed. The poor man is a martyr to his wife. She's at a critical age and has an authority and avarice complex that's quite amazing. What's that? And her? Could she have done it? No!...poor woman... she's no Lady Macbeth. The greatest frenzy she can muster is in tightening purse strings. Someone's here for you. Lucas, something new? You guessed right. The handbag'd been stolen. I've got it back. She's a freelance apartment-broker. Very interesting How're you going? You know each other? Sorry I took you for Monsieur Vergne. From the research section. No harm done. On the contrary. Thanks Lucas. What for Chief? You've given me an idea. What idea? The clairvoyant has been murdered twice. The clairvoyant has been murdered twice. The murderer made a mistake. So the unfortunate apartment-broker gets off the metro at the Lamarck station. In the elevator her bag is snatched. She was probably going to report it at the police station, when in front of Rue Durantin she saw a removal van. Could be a business opportunity... The concierge isn't there She goes upstairs, passing Arnaud de B?darieu. She asks him the time. Her watch was in her bag. That's very important. The apartment door is half-open...like this. The killer is there... he doesn't know her. He assumes she is Madame Dumont. He kills her. Suddenly he notices across the way that the blind man is looking at him. He panics...he shoots. But he doesn't want the body found right away. He drags it... ...stuffs it into the wardrobe... ...shuts the door... and pockets the key. Next day, from reading the papers, he sees he's made a mistake. He starts again. And this time he succeeds. Ye. That's an ingenious theory. But why the fanfare to warn the press... "Today, Friday at 6pm I'll kill the clairvoyant." "Signed: Picpus" I confess that's got me. It seems to indicate there's something very odd about the killer. A nutter? Le Cloaguen? You should arrest him. No! You don't do anything but play mind games. What did she mean by: "He confessed" I was going to ask you that. Who confessed? And what did they confess? I'm not a clairvoyant. Do you have to pace up and down like that... it gets on my nerves! No way of questioning her? She's in a coma. At Picpus hospital? Picpus. I've had enough of that name. It haunts me. It's going to be the word of the day. Taxi drivers are full of it..."Picpus" We gotta arrest someone! Call Amadieu.. he'll arrest the removalists. And why not? Boss, if you accept my reasoning about the killer making a mistake, the removalists can't possibly be gully. What about your B?darieu? The second-rate writer? Same reasoning. He knew the clairvoyant? Good...he's confessed. That airy-fairy scribbler didn't have it in him. She told him her customers troubles and it gave him material for his novels. That doesn't give us a gully party. No, boss, that's even going to give us another murder. What? Yes. It's for you. I've been all over Rue Biot and eventually found his house. Nobody's seen him back at his place. Is he with you? No? That's very impressive. What should I do? Come back. Well? I was listening... I'm waiting to hear what's going on. Someone came to see me this afternoon. Honor? Mascouvin. He told me of a murder which subsequently happened. Mascouvin looked like a man who was afraid. He should have come back here this evening. He's not at home. He won't come back. You were set up. Me? Yes, you Maigret... ... king of the inspired hunch... someone's playing games with you. It was him who sent the message to Paris-Soir. The whole place-mat business was a cock and bull story. Those are my thoughts exactly. So...? He got you into the caf? to point you to Rue Durantin, and during that time he's killed the clairvoyant. And now he's vanished. No, no. Why not? No. More Maigret hunches? Yes. Do whatever it takes to bring him in to me. I'll get a confession out of your Mascouvin. OK, boss. So what do YOU think? Nothing. Where are you going? To stand in front of the map of Paris. Are you screwing with me? What are you going to do there? Wait for Mascouvin. "Rue des Bon-Enfants: a drunk." Aren't you tired of walking, Chief? "Ballu: A brawl" "Place Blanche: razor attack" "A death: Alberto Constantini" "One wounded: Paolini" "Killer arrested: Jules Bernasconi, 32" "St-Phllippe-du-Roule: a suicide...by gas" "Eug?nie Fierat, 27 years" "Jules-Joffrin : accident" "Ad?le Flamand: knocked down by hit-and-run cyclist" "Number 27-23-R8. Ad?le Flamand, aged 68" Maybe it won't happen tonight, Chief. I feel as if I received a letter up here telling me: "Mascouvin will be murdered" "Saints-P?res : chimney fire. 17 Rue Bonaparte" Will this never end? Do you remember what he was saying? About doing nothing about a crime that you knew was going to happen. "Place Voltaire : a drunk." There's something better we could be doing. For me it's eating. I don't know about you, but nothing's more important for me. "Arsenal : accident..." "Honor? Mascouvin, fell from the bridge" "Struck a pylon. Dead from fractured skull." Dead. Honor? Mascouvin, aged 42 "Signed: Picpus" Good morning monsieur. Can I help you? Is Monsieur Mascouvin in? He's not here. Could I see who fills in for him? Just a moment. Good morning. You want to see Monsieur Mascouvin? What was it about? Can we talk in private? Certainly. Your firm was recommended to me. By a friend of mine. Please sit down. I need some advice. I have some money. Not a fortune, but all the same... Do you have anything that might interest me? Do you find this comedy amusing? You're police. What do you want? How did you work that out? A hunch. You have them too? And so charming! - You've come here to tell me that? - No. What's your name? - Berthe. - Mademoiselle Berthe, we've received a complaint. You're not surprised? Nothing surprises me. I'm listening. He stole 1000 francs. I wouldn't become a thief for 1000 francs Who are you accusing? There's only Monsieur Mascouvin and me. He's the one in question. What are you telling me? That he'd steal from himself? He's the business-owner? Yes. There's no other boss? Yes, but we never see him. Like the Good Lord, he's far away. I don't even know him. He leaves you here to look after his little blackmail business. Excuse me... I have my information. You were also in the private-detective business. Who was handling that? Monsieur Mascouvin will answer your questions. No! Why. Because he's dead. Dead? An accident? Perhaps. He was found under a bridge. With a fractured skull. What can you think about it? What do you want me to think about it? I'm overcome. With heartache? What can you do about it? I'm here because I'm investigating Mascouvin. So help me. - Do your job. - Of course. But you liked Mascouvin, didn't you? So help me. What do you know about him? Not much. He didn't betray much about himself. He preferred to betray his friends. You certainly didn't know him! That's why I need to know more. You wouldn't have a photo of him? Yes. Poor Mascouvin... he was a strange sort of guy. He looked after a sick sister. He was a nice man. But always anxious, tormented about something. He managed this business consultancy and had some scruples. He was honest in an old-fashioned way. Do you think he was capable of killing someone? He wouldn't kill a fly. - Here we are. - That's him? Yes He hasn't got glasses on. He didn't wear glasses. Yesterday he did. He liked to disguise himself. He was also our private eye. See those books... ...they're all whodunits. Now I understand. What do you understand? Picpus. I'll show you his cupboard. How do I look? It's an improvement. You're too kind. Another question. - D'you know a Dr Le Cloagen? - No. Did Mascouvin have any involvement with a clairvoyant? No. But I've only been here a year. I'll check your files. The store-room's full of them. Mademoiselle Berthe... What is it? A gentlemen A gentleman wants to talk to Monsieur Mascouvin. Who is it? Who is it? He didn't give a name. He's weird. Have him come in. I'm going to look at the files. Make yourself at home. You wanted Monsieur Mascouvin? Yes, Mascouvin. It's personal and confidential. Mascouvin. I'm sorry that's not possible. It's very important. I need to see him. Need to! He's the only one who can speak to me. Sadly... he can no longer speak to anyone. But I want to see him. No, you can't. No, you can't. He's dead. Dead! Dead? Good Lord... then I'll be off. I'll be off. So you do know him? Who? The doctor. No, that's the first time. You're coming along with me. We're going to follow him. He has to be followed. Has that man ever been here before? No, never. Write down any messages. Hi fellas, here's some cigarettes... ...and sugar...and chocolate. Where did I put my chocolate? Ah...I ate it.... This one's good, it's milk Thanks, Emile. "Emile"? G'day Monsieur Emile. G'day boss. What'll you have? A round of the best. I've got the money. Where've I put my money? Here perhaps. Nothing there. No drinks. My head... Ah!.. here it is in my hat. And now we drink. Poor Jeanne. We got on so well. And the police? A lot of good-for-nothings. A mob of la-de-das! To do their job they need to be smart. Most of them are dumb. If I had all my marbles I'd make good use of my time. But I don't have it in there any more. I get so tired. Full of holes like a Swiss cheese. What's he doing with that lot? Miserable wretches. Do you find it rare in a man that he could be interested in something other than you. You never stop. I've been like a king from history with my daughter. Which king? The king we put on the scaffold. The executioner asked him to let him tie his hands. ''I'll grant this favour but it will be the last.'' One day I found myself in the hospice. At first we still defend ourselves. We cajole, we protest. Then you lose courage... and little by little you fade. That's the fate of the elderly. The old-age pension ahead of youth. There it is... the fate of the elderly. Don't like seeing that... makes me thirsty. To you, ?mile. To the lot of you ! ?mile... You're working out a problem? Yes. It's my geometry. But here, the triangles and circles are living. They have hearts and heads. Must be understood. The shortest way from one point to another, is always a straight line. What's that circle? That's Mascouvin. And that one? Le Cloaguen, the old guy over there. And that one? The clairvoyant who was killed. When I've found the intersection of these three circles... Well? I'll have the gully person. Bravo. You don't seem pleased. I was impressed. ''Impressed.'' I know. Where are you going? It's late. Stay here. Are you going to keep me all night? I wouldn't dare suggest it. I'd better phone. Who? If you must know... I know who it is. Am I allowed to have a private life? There's no 'phone here. Isn't there? Don't you have a telephone. ''Telephone''? I don't like to be ruled by a bell I'm boss here. And please don't draw on the table. I'll call you at your office. This evening? Perhaps. And your rendez-vous? I'll let it slide. Poor boy. It's my mother. Tell her that you won't be back. Why? Because I'm arresting you. Me? Gives me more chances to make jokes! I've been waiting for you for four hours ! And what do you have for me? Nothing!! Your hunches can very attractive, but not if they get nowhere. The police isn't made up of chorus-boys. We're the laughing stock of the country ! I know who it is. I'm listening. It's Mascouvin. The killer? No. The author of the letter. Signed ''Picpus'' because of the first murder. He'd wanted to prevent the second one. He didn't have time to speak. What a shame you can't speak with the dead. That's all you've found? ''Picpus'' ! A killer who doesn't exist and a dead witness. It wasn't me who killed him. You should have arrested him. I feel bad enough about that already. You're not arresting anyone. As far as you're concerned, all the suspects are angels. Unfortunately angels have wings and can fly away! Le Cloaguen. Well? You haven't arrested him. No. Le Cloaguen's gully? Yes...his wife has phoned four times, you hear me? He's vanished. You hear? Vanished ! And do you know what she said? No. ''So he doesn't commit another murder.'' You hear that? What are you getting us into ! I'll be forced to resign. No. Why not? I knew that Le Cloaguen had disappeared. But not since this afternoon. What? It's been a long time. 80, 84, 104, 108, 123 for you. And my third? That's fair. 140 for you. Who's winning? Him, Chief. He plays a very impressive game. Because you've got a good memory. I'm crazy... I haven't killed anyone. Tell me...how did you stop that yellow fever epidemic? That's history. For a doctor, it was your moment of glory. Drugs. All the drugs. And Senorita Lopez Diaz, how old was she? How old? I can't remember...the brain.. You don't want to answer. Why? I'm crazy. In mills they grind wheat to make flour. In cities we crush brains to make madmen. You aren't crazy. Who are you? Answer me. Why do you put up with that bitching woman stopping you from smoking and drinking? And the deep sea bedroom with a bolt outside the door? I'm just a poor guy who's lost his liberty.. And if I took you back to her what would you do? You're scared. You don't like the police. You don't want to talk. So listen to me Tonight, right now 7pm, Jeanne Dumont is dead at Picpus hospital. You hear me? Dead ! Yes, I know, go...it's hard. Here they believe you've been keeping her. They've got nasty minds. I don't think like them. I know that she was your daughter. Lucas... later on, maybe you'll replace me. Follow me. Follow my methods. Keep the blinkers off. Don't just see the world from the toilet window. Don't try and... impress, Chief. Lucas, I'm going to try something. And if it doesn't work it could cost me my job. I'm not going to bother you any more. You're free to go. ''Free''? But if I knew what you know... I'd avenge my daughter. Even if I was old, not too steady. I'd avenge my daughter. Give me 500 francs. To do what with? Show me the way out. I'll take you down. You got some cigarettes, Lucas? Yes, Chief. Go fetch my matches. ''Matches''? My matches. Ah good. See you, Chief. Nice evening, eh? Very nice. I forgot my papers. Get your Paris-Soir ! Sensational development. The Picpus case ! Get your Paris-Soir ! All we can do is follow him. I couldn't warn you. We followed the old guy all afternoon. He didn't talk Now, tell me... what happened with Mascouvin? No names. I've a right to know. I don't know what more I can do. I'll see him again this evening. Stick with him. Keep me posted. If he tries to leave, hang on to him. There you are, and please don't draw on the table. It's not nice to deface it. I'm sorry. Come here. My right profile is the best. It's not yours that interests me. Thanks. 32 francs. You're late. I've been running. He's on the train. I have the details. 3rd class, carriage 7, compartment 3. You know who I saw on the platform? The Pope? No, Chief. Arnaud de B?darieu, the novelist. I was so impressed that I let him get away. He could be a pain in the neck. Whadda you think? Nothing. It complicates things. It doesn't complicate things. I know who it is. The killer? His goose is cooked. That's good...I'm hungry. There's a dining car. You're not leaving. What? You'll need some courage to help me win this one. You'll think badly of me But, Chief... I've work for you here. That's what you've got to take care of. I've booked two places. But I need two. Is it the woman you phoned earlier? Don't take it the wrong way. I have an idea. What do you think? Nothing. Waiter ! Take off your glasses. He's sleeping. Good, Chief. Where are we going? I don't know. You don't know? I've 2 tickets for the end of the line. We may get off before then. No time to get bored, with you! I take that as a compliment? Shame you're a cop. 'Le Proven?al', every modern comfort. So, you coming? Is Attorney Laignan in? No, Monsieur. I'll wait for him. Come in. Monsieur Destac, someone's asking for Laignan. But he's not here. He's an old acquaintance, he said. His name? Dr Le Cloaguen. What's this about? Don't fear. Inspector Maigret I needed to see you before the visitor. Warn Attorney Laignan. He's in town. Can he be phoned?? That's difficult. Destac, senior clerk. Can I help you? Your visitor is being investigated for murder. He is a crazy escapee. Do not move. If the police... Let him wait. Just until Monsieur Laignan's return. If he doesn't want to? Say anything to him. I'll get reinforcements. Berthe ! Yes, Chief. I'm going to look for Laignan. You can help these gentlemen keep the old guy here. - OK, Chief ! This is your reinforcements...a woman? But quite a girl. Where will I find Laignan? At the 'Last of the Mohicans'. It's an archery club. There's a function. Ladies and gentlemen let me remind you that this is a charitable event Deductions made, of course for overheads, wages and so on. Here we live for archery. Otherwise we live from hand to mouth. So help by buying souvenirs from our charming sales girls. Enjoy yourselves in a good cause.

Pardon, monsieur Laignan. Where is he? Over there. Will you fill in for me? What's happened? Left your post? We have a distinguished guest. Inspector Maigret Excuse me. If I'd known you were coming... Come in here... it'll be quieter. This morning I was astounded... I'm sorry. I'm very sorry. The arrow just got away. This is your quiet corner? In the name of the committee, please accept every apology for this almost unfortunate incident. In the name of the Last of the Mohicans, our every apology. Yes. Thank you very much. He took me for a colleague. Who is this marksman? Commander Boufartigue, a great pistol shot. At 50 metres he can cut a card in two. He and Le Cloaguen, were our grand champions. He knows Le Cloaguen? I should say so ! I believe too that he and Madame Le Cloaguen ..... Go on. The secret is not mine and I hesitate to reveal it to you. My duty... Is to help the law. Buy some flowers. Profits to the orphans. The gentleman is not here for the flowers. Why not? Maybe I have someone to give them to. That suits you. You'll just need a bow to look like Cupid. Here are the Graces. Charming. Let me leave you for just a minute. I'll just free myself from my obligations and we'll continue this conversation. I'll show you an interesting document. Got to run. In 10 minutes... in my office Would you like a pin? Thank you. Exactly, I'm off to the haberdasher's. Pardon. Monsieur, the old man's left. Left? My brother? And the woman? Her too. Couldn't stop him. Laignan's there? He phoned. He'll be here in 15 min. Where's Le Cloaguen gone to? La Marjolaine. He asked for the keys. ''La Marjolaine''? It's an old house. It's dreadful ! What? Where's La Marjolaine? I'll take you there. That's it. Have you seen anyone come in here? An old man and a young woman. What? An old man and a young woman. Ah yes. The house is abandoned. But since last night there's been a light shining. It's not natural. He's as deaf as a post. Stay here. Do you take me for a weak little woman? Isn't it a shame. It was such a beautiful house Look at the marble. This armchair...I don't even have one. She was avaricious, nasty. She... It's my brother. It's a bad sign. You're superstitious? He's changed. What's that? The cellar. Not so fast. I don't want to break a leg. The cellar carved out of the rock. Wine keeps there very nicely. But she didn?t like wine. She didn't like anything at all. Other than polish for her parquet floor. Yves Le Cloaguen, I arrest you. Yves? That's not possible. This is not my brother. This isn't Yves. No, it's not your brother. May I present ?mile Dumont, who's being playing the role of your brother for 10 years. Well old boy, we're going to talk. By the way, where's Berthe? Berthe? The young woman with you. I'm crazy. I haven't killed anyone. What are you doing here? Le Cloaguen. You've killed him? No. But I found him. Where did you find him? There. My poor brother ! Start talking. Dr Le Cloaguen's been dead for 10 years. Yves. Yes, Madame. It was a blow for the widow who'd always been close to her money. The 200 000 franc annuity was paid to the doctor personally. Well then? Well then? There was a tramp in Cannes. That's me. ?mile Dumont. It seems I looked like the doctor. I was hired to play the role. I should've had a peaceful life of food, smokes and drink. So I wouldn't be recognized, we moved to Paris. Then the old woman got scared I might do the dirty on her, and spill the beans. She kept me locked up. You know the downstairs bedroom with the bolt. She hated me. You know who killed your daughter. Tell me who its is. It's... Hands up ! Turn around. Move away, Madame. Not bad, Monsieur Maigret. You've seen things quite clearly. Even though it's dark in here. If I saw your face, I'd be enlightened. You've got a hide. And reports on which I note my findings. They're in my office in Paris. I believe I've left a clear picture. And what about Berthe? You've a clear picture there? Berthe? So I didn't make a mistake. That's a shame. I hope for her sake she didn't know everything. That you've murdered Mascouvin, her half-brother. Mascouvin? That's enough. Bitch ! Let me go ! Throw down your revolver, Monsieur Maigret. You bastard. Raise your hands. Against the wall. What's going to happen? Tell me what you have in your report. That's my secret. As you are going to make the acquaintance of those in the hereafter... it's pointless to start making with mysteries. What's in the report? As I said, I'll carry my secrets to the grave. What do you know? Speak. Everything. I'm listening. You were the lover. You replaced the husband. You killed him. You replaced him with ?mile Dumont. After? After? After? In Paris you started a blackmail boutique, disguised as a business consultancy. An employee of yours, Honor? Mascouvin, served as your front man. You used information from a clairvoyant.... ...you were given her client's confidences. Unfortunately for you she found her father. She threatened to reveal your swindle and your name. Then you killed her. Mascouvin knew about it. And he tried to warn us. Poor old thing. As for you, my little Berthe, I hope you can find a good lawyer. I was forgetting...Here. I bought this for you. You're too kind. Like a prison gate. Raise your hands ! What do you want? I wanted to give you a hand. You turn up when it's all over. What are you doing here? I... I was going to talk to you. You're looking for the last chapter in your novel. I just got it in punches. You knew about my novel? Yes. And it won't cost you any grey cells. I spotted you with your air of a conspirator, your mocking remarks, your open newspaper... You recognised me? You're lucky. Amadieu thought you looked like a murderer. You've arrested him? Amadieu? The killer. Come and see. You remember what words Jeanne Dumont said when she collapsed? ''ll a avou? - he confessed.'' What she was trying to say was : ''C'est l'avou?" - it's the lawyer So Monsieur 'lawyer'... do you 'confess'? You've killed the doctor, the broker, the blind man, Jeanne Dumont, Mascouvin and now poor old ?mile. You've won, Monsieur Maigret. Game over. Signed : ''Picpus.'' - I was right. knit one, purl one. Go 15 rows and reverse. In the end it's simple. Knitting a sleeve? No. The Picpus case. It was easy for Maigret. I'd love to see his face. He forbids having his picture in the papers. Is that possible? Maybe he's a monster. Wait. Monsieur Albert, could I take your paper? Chief. What? It was very impressive. Subtitles: FatPlank [KG] aka RLB [SC]
