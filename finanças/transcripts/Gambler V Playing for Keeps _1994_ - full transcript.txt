I bet he didn't buy all that gold on a policeman's pay either. Get these animals out of here! You, stop ringing that, stop ringing that bell. Then get these cows out of my way! Stop, stop honking that horn! Who is in charge of these animals? Come on, move 'em, move 'em, move 'em! What about my schedule, sheriff? I dare you. Don't dare me. Yeah, I'm daring you. Don't dare me. You're crazy if you think I'm gonna try to lift his watch in broad daylight. Besides, he's heeled. So what? So are you. Not so's you noticed, am I? No, not so's you'd notice. But the more I think about it, the more I think you have to have that watch. I double dare you. Don't go to double dare me, Butch. I'm double daring you. And don't call me Butch in a crowded street. All right, George. Come on, let's get it. Get! Go on, get! Get the damn trail boss here. Get out of here! Stop honking that horn. You hear me? I said stop! Now hold on, I got it now. I got it. Sir, we'll take care of this. Move that car! Thank you. And those cattle, move the cattle now! All right? Let's get. I'm giving you one minute. Come on, get out of my way. Move it now. Get out of my way. Stop them. Stop, stop them! Stop them! Stop! Watch out! Can you still hear me? Stop! I am serious, boys. I said stop! Here, you wanted it. Damn fool. You probably made us late for the photograph. I told you not to double dare me. Robbie McCracken, one of Fort Worth's finest. Fanny, I'm just doing my job. I'm after a couple of pickpockets. And I suppose you were just trying to do your job when you and Sergeant Emory tried to street hustle my girl Louisa Friday night. If you wanna do business with any of Fanny Porter's girls, you come to Fanny Porter's front door. You know, it's a sad day in Texas when a taxpayer can't even count on the police to do the right thing. I. Thanks, Fanny. You're a jewel, Fanny. Afternoon, everybody. Well, it's about time. If you two jokesters don't stop pulling schoolboy pranks. Butch, I've been thinking. I don't want my picture took. If I looked like you, I wouldn't want my picture took either. Etta, Louisa, you two are radiant. We about gave up on you. We were gonna call the whole thing off. We've been jewelry shopping. Now Etta, you tell me, has your man ever looked so fine and elegant? Just the touch. You should have seen Fanny. She had one of Fort Worth's finest backing like a crawfish. Robbie McCracken. Thank you. May we please get started? Oh, yes, I'm sure Mr. Schwartz has many appointments. And I am running a little behind. You'd be Mr. Jones, Mr. Johnson? Mr. Johnson. Mr. Jones. Please be seated. I think that one. Yeah. Come on, jump in here, kid. You're either with us or not. Yeah, come on, every picture needs at least one pretty face. You make me this handsome, or I'll kill you. I'm gonna stand. What's it gonna be, hats on or off? Gentlemen never wear their hats under a roof. That settles it, hats on. Be serious. Here, Brady, let me give you a hand. You act like I can't do anything. I can do this. Well, all right. Brady, I am no carpenter. And I'm no roofer. I left home so I wouldn't have to split shingles, Brady. Don't you even think about welshing on our deal, Billy Montana. I won this ranch in a poker game. I staked you and you lost. You're supposed to stay here and help me fix this up. Yeah sure, I agreed to help you fix her up and to get her sold, but you're building a nest here. Neither one of us knows a doggone thing about ranching. I tried to give you a hand. You're helpless as two hens on a plow handle. A man learns to do by doing. I know what I'm doing. I been here since the first day this place was built. Yeah? I sure hope you're in better shape than this place, you old goat. What? Ow! Son of a. Billy, Billy, Billy. What more could a man want? Yeah, well a few green trees wouldn't hurt. It's gonna be a full bloom come springtime. Trees been dead 10 years. Yeah, this spring we'll have 100 cows and 100 calves. Next spring, 200 cows, 200 calves. That's how it works, just grows on its own. The coyotes, the wolves, the drought, if that blue norther yonder coming right at us don't kill off the whole herd before New Year's. Why do you think that fella that tossed this place into the pot was smiling? That's the first thing you got right. How's this, Frisco? Backwards. What? Let me do it, you mule-headed fool. If you wanna help, why don't you climb on up there and hand me some of them shingles? Don't see what you see in this place. You can't hand down four of a kind or a royal flush. Now cattle, water and land, that's a legacy. Legacy my ow! Agh! Ooh! You bull-headed fools won't live to see spring. Ow. Here. Oh. I was hoping you were through with your bellyaching. I got the worst of it. How bad did that nail get me? I've been cut worse sitting on a prickly pear. Here, Brady. Look, maybe you won't be sitting in the saddle so good for the next two or three days, but at least you'll be walking. Ow! You hurt me worse than the nail. Ooh, watch out, Frisco. You might want him to bite on a bullet. Billy, I'm afraid to give him a bullet. Put it between his teeth, he'd blow his brains out. Here, read this. It'll take your mind off your troubles and put 'em on somebody else. How long have you had this paper? About a month. Old news is better than no news. It's the Wild Bunch, just like it says. That's a fool stunt, putting their picture in the paper. I know those fellas. Butch and Sundance are smarter than that. You know Butch and Sundance? In a matter of speaking, yep. Real pistols they are, lean and mean. I mean they'll steal your boots, your socks, and the gold fillings out of your teeth. Have you ever talked to them? Well, I was up in Brown's Hole once and there they was, and they was counting their loot and holding court. Billy, have you ever actually talked to them? I never really did have a conversation with them exactly, but I got a good look at 'em, Brady. And I'm telling you, fellas, they're a Wild Bunch. That young one kind of looks out of place, don't he? Well, whoever he is, he won't last very long. Everybody wearing a badge west of Omaha's looking for the Wild Bunch. You know what I hear? The Pinkerton Detective Agency has got 100 or more of their best men tracking down the Bunch. Billy. They're either gonna hang 'em, shoot 'em, or haul 'em off to prison... Yep, that's the Wild Bunch. Look again. How the hell did that happen? Brady, it just don't seem right you riding out of here without me. But if you need me, you know where I am. I expect to see you both here when we get back. Who's we? What do you figure he's doing, kid? Stringing telephone lines. I wonder how it works. Transmitters, electric currents, amplifiers. Won't be long till people'll be able to talk clear across the country. That's gonna be hell on outlawing, ain't it??? A penny for Teddy. And for. Lizzie. Lizzie, and for. Sara. Sara. Say thank you, children. Thank you. Now you just go on over there and wait for me. Go on now. Step right up here, please. Thank you. Ma'am, it's just the largest bill now is a 10. There you go. And I thank you for your courtesy. Good day. You're quite welcome and good day to you. Good morning, Sir, I'd like to make a deposit. Fine, Ma'am, and how much would you like to deposit? Miss, I believe you dropped this. Oh my goodness, I believe you're right. Three tellers, only one bank officer, lots of cash on hand. Sounds like a piece of cake, wedding cake. Complete with frosting? One or two more and we'll be out of the business and out of the country. That's a promise, Etta. One fine morning it'll all be over. One fine morning it damn well better be. And I thank you for your kindness. Payday, boys, look lively. Good morning, folks. Now listen carefully, in my hand I hold a powerful potion. Now for those you who don't read so good, maybe your eyes aren't great, it says Nitroglycerin. The most powerful explosive known to mankind. It's them, the Wild Bunch. Shh! Don't nobody move. I seen their picture. Hush your mouth, Teddy. And you didn't seen their picture, you saw it. She's right, son, it's saw. Rest easy, kid. You're gonna twist your head plumb off. That's gonna give away the whole shooting match. It's not like I had much experience, Mr. Ketchum. Mr. Ketchum... You are some sidekick. You ain't doing nothing but sitting your horse. Them inside are the bank robbers. As far as experience, well that'll come soon enough. You starting to figure maybe you should have stayed behind when Butch and Sundance broke jail? No. They may not be counting on me now, but that day will come. This is mine. This is mine. In a few moments we'll be gone and you can go back to your business and Santa Rita will be famous. Nobody leaves. Come on, lady, let's give it up now. Hurry up, come on, come on, come on. I ain't got all day. Come on. Thank you, I appreciate it. Back up, give me your wallets. Come on, hustle. All I've got's my wedding ring. Ma'am, we don't take wedding rings. Would you like my penny? Or mine? Or mine? You keep 'em. Just don't put 'em in a bank. All right, folks, we're gonna go now. And much obliged to you, but there's just one more thing. I recommend y'all leave through the back door because I'm gonna take this little bottle, I'm gonna set it on the other side of the front door and lord only knows what'll happen if somebody kick it or knock it over. Call the sheriff. Teddy, come back here. Hey, young man, no use wasting a perfectly good bottle of nitro. Hold on to this for me. Don't believe half of what you hear. Nothing but plain old well water in that bottle, Fingers. Fingers, I like it.

Hands in the air. Teddy, why do we always have to be the folks being robbed? 'Cause y'all are girls and girls can't be bank robbers. That's not true. Yeah, it is. You weren't even there, Billy. Yeah, you weren't even there. We saw the Wild Bunch rob the bank. We saw the whole thing. Stick 'em up! You drop those weapons. Which one of you hombres is Billy the Kid? The Wild Bunch sent me back here to see who could identify them from the bank robbery. Sir, I wasn't even there, they were. Did you kids really see that bank robbery? Yes, Sir, we did. Are you gonna hurt us? No, I never saw a bank robbery. What was it like? Well, it was pretty scary. How many were there? There were three of 'em, Butch, Sundance and another fella. Looked just like their picture. Mama told us to stay away from them. There were just three of 'em? There was a bunch more out in the street. Bounty hunter, stand clear of those young'uns. You've been asking questions all over town. You ask questions in Santa Rita, you start with Jethro Boone. That's me. First of all, I'm not a bounty hunter, sheriff. You don't look like a Pinkerton. I'm no Pinkerton. Newspaper. No. Well, what's just your interest in the Wild Bunch? Purely personal. You do better than that, Mister, or I'll turn you over to the Pinkertons and they'll beat the answers out of you. Sheriff, I've been tracking the Wild Bunch for the better part of a week. I'm tired, I'm dirty, and I am fed up. And if you ever stick a shotgun in my ribs again, you'd better have paper on me. Sheriff, you all right? Hey, Mister, if you're really gonna run across them Wild Bunchers, give 'em this. They dropped it when they rode off. Thanks, kid. It's gonna be easier than pouring molasses over johnnycakes. Payroll is dropped off the night train around midnight. Mine crew won't be along to take delivery till noon or thereabouts. We ride on down, help ourselves, and be a half a dozen miles back in the hills by noon. Let's go. Not yet, son. No point in complicating matters. We just wait till that wagon clears out. Haven't you already read all those letters? Sure, once or twice. The mail from home's a comfort to him. Mail from anywhere's a comfort, as long as it's not addressed to some jail or prison. See this one here? It's from my sister over in Provo. She was just about to have her baby when she mailed this. If the Pinkertons ever catch on to your damn mail, the postman's gonna be packing a badge and a pair of those new-fangled handcuffs. Hyah, move on! Time for a visitation. You gents are early. I'll be with you in a minute. We're kind of in a hurry, if you don't mind. Don't you fellas know you're in all the papers? The picture. Yeah, we heard. We're needing some traveling money. The Great Western payroll, we're here to take delivery, Right now. That's gonna take some doing. Yeah, why's that? Yeah, why is that? Train conductor has one key. He's long gone. Mine foreman has the other. Of course, he'll be along in a little while with a bunch of shotgun guards if you care to wait. Go ahead and shoot him, Black Jack, he's lying. Can't wait, no time. Fingers, get in here! Don't move. Coming, Butch. Gimme the bag. I can do it. Unless of course this stuff's just water or sawdust. I'm getting more contradiction from this kid. Whoa, Butch, give the kid a shot at it. A shot? Give the kid a shot at it, we'll step outside while he blows the door off of this thing. Fine, shoot it. Etta! Does the kid know anything about explosives? Only that water won't blow up when you drop it. He's gotta learn sometime, on the job training. You gave him the explosives? His idea. How many sticks you use? All of it. The whole bundle? Yeah. 12 Sticks? How much fuse? Great, let the kid do it. Run! Good God almighty! There was enough dynamite in that bundle to blow up.. A railroad station. Right. Now if we had any dynamite left, we could pry the door off of that safe. You can bet them mine guards heard the big bang and they're gonna come a-running and a-shooting. Whoa. I sure hate to leave.. Where are they? Where is he? Where's it coming from? I can't see 'em. Where are they? There! There! Get outta here! Etta, move! Pinkertons! Pinkertons! Black Jack! You're hit, can you ride? Yeah. Can you ride? Then go, get! Get! Hold your fire. I had 'em, Mr. Dimaio. I could have knocked 'em all down. Nobody appointed Ford Hayes judge or jury. There's no dead or alive papers on any of those men. Track 'em, Mr. Howard. Blood oughta make it easier from here on. Mr. Hayes, it was your shot. Go down and retrieve your kill. And pray to God it was one of the Wild Bunch. Slack off, it's too damn tight. It's the only way to stop the bleeding. Rip off another piece of that cloth quick. Hold that. Hold on, hold on. Hold that, hold that. Okay. I mean it, Etta, no argument, you're going back to Fanny's till those Pinkertons get worn out or until we raise some getaway cash and come and get you. I'll get a stake together and I'll make an honest woman out of you. I promise. The tighter we wrap it, the less it's gonna hurt, Jack. You're gonna be fine. You hear me, Etta? You hear me? It's too late to be making an honest woman out of me, Harry Longabaugh. There's been a killing. I'd be figuring on how to save my own hide and get loose from the Pinkertons if I was you. Etta, there'd be a lot fewer problems if you'd just do what he says. You're gonna be fine. Hell of a fix, ain't it? Are you gonna make it, kid? I just never figured on all the, on all the shooting and killing. It's not much of a life. And it's not gonna get any better. If I was you, I'd ride clear of it and find myself a new line of work. I was never meaning to get into it in the first place. It just happened. I was riding west, figuring on finding my daddy, just to see what kind of guy he was. Wound up in jail. Butch and Sundance was planning on leaving. They knocked out a deputy, said come on, kid. I've been riding so hard and so fast ever since. I just haven't had time to think about any of the other stuff. Your daddy, what sort is he? He's a traveling man. I heard he got himself a ranch. I figured I could learn a lot more working for him than I could at school. Would you believe that I started out teaching school? I try not to think about what I gave up. Harry's always talking about taking me away from all this some fine morning. Let me tell you something, Jeremiah Smith, or whatever, there aren't many fine mornings in this line of work. Don't figure on him and Butch giving you a home. If I was you, I'd saddle up and ride out right now and I'd never look back. Maybe a week ago, last month, but not now. I know. Etta, Fingers. Listen up. We got a plan. The Rocky Mountain Special should be coming slow on the upgrade in the pine thickets out of Trinidad. We're gonna split her in half and help ourselves to the express chest. Black Jack will sit tight here. We'll pick him up after the heist. We'll get him to a good sawbones. Etta, you're gonna be on that train. Are we still having this argument, Harry Longabaugh? No, Etta, it's part of the plan. You gotta be on the train or the plan won't work. Have a look, Fingers. She's maybe two miles out and a damn pretty sight. More like three miles. Now how do you know that? The speed sound travels. 1,085 feet per second. Why Fingers, that college education of yours may come in handy yet. It's about time I put it to use. All right, let's get moving. She shoots a tad high, son. Let me take the coach. I can't, it's too dangerous. I'm not much of a rifle shot. I'd do much better on the coach, Butch. Mm-hmm, like you did blowing the door off of that safe. I can do this. Don't look at me, you call it. But if we don't move now, we're gonna leave Etta holding the bag. All right, it's all yours, kid. Wait'll she comes out of the cut, Fingers, Then jump like a cat on a mouse. Hyah! Tickets, tickets please. Traveling all alone, Missy? Yes. Well, you'll be safe on the Special, especially with a trainload of Pinkertons. There you go. Thank you. Tickets. Mister, there's no Sheffield Station anymore. The Wild Bunch blew it sky high. Big shootout, one dead. That's why my train's full of Pinkertons. You're gonna have to ride on through to Cimarron, Mister. Tickets. If I were in charge, I'd shoot the whole bunch. That's what you do with snakes, shoot 'em dead. Did they say which one got killed? Yeah, a real mean one, Flatnose George Curry. One of the worst. Probably rounded up the whole Bunch by now. Frank Dimaio's running the show. Sure wish I was with him instead of riding shotgun on the Special. Nobody would be damn fool enough to try anything, not with a bunch of Pinkerton's finest riding the rails. Excuse the language, little lady. That's quite all right. I can certainly understand your frustration. The last time we were so close. If you'd excuse me, Sir. We were just a whisker's width away. Frank Dimaio's on the case. This time he's gonna get 'em for sure. But I really need to go to the. Oh, well excuse me, little lady. Thank you kindly. Excuse me. Ma'am. Say, tell me some more about this Dimaio. One minute after she crosses Staghorn Trestle, there oughta be a big bang. You better hope we hear two big bangs. Pray to god Etta's doing her job. Little lady, you ought not to be smoking those stogies. Excuse me, I need to get in there. Oh, Sir, I feel so faint. Could you help me to my seat? Ladies should not be smoking. No, Sir. What you aiming to do, boy? You'll find out soon enough. That passenger coach is packed with Pinkertons and they all got shotguns. Yeah, I know. You back away from that emergency cord. Thank you. You're welcome. That minute's about up. Not quite. Feeling a little bit better, Ma'am? I don't know what quite hit me. Thunderation, it's the Wild Bunch. That's my Etta. They blew the coupling! Someone pull the emergency cord. But I am frightened, Sir. Lady, you'll be all right. Just sit tight. Pardon me. Excuse me, Sir. Don't! Come on, boys, let's go! Come on, men! Oh, sorry. Sorry, Sir. My fault entirely. You go help Fingers with the strongbox. I'll hang back and dance with the Pinkertons for a while. Let's go! Get the tree off of there. Move that tree! Get down! Get down, men! Where the hell is he? Hey, kid, there's hope for you yet. I don't see him. Let's go! Help! Who's that over there? Help! Abernathy. Help! Come on, fellas, come on. Help! Help. Easy, easy. It was them, the Wild Bunch for sure. Cleaned out the express box. Anybody hurt? No, just scared half to death. I don't mind telling you, the Wild Bunch ain't the half of it. They is meaner than snakes. What's your interest, Mister? They was shooting at me too. One of them boys owes me a lot of money. Just remember who's in charge. I put up a hell of a scrap. That young'un was gonna pistol-whip me. But I stared him down, called his bluff, broke loose, and come running. Meaner than hell that young'un was. They called him Fingers. Fingers? Never heard of him. Nothing. No sign of life at all. You sure are putting a lot of faith in him. He's worthy of it. Scatter and move downslope, slow and easy. They're either in there or they've been there. And I don't want the first shot coming from a Pinkerton. Do you understand that, Mr. Hayes? Move out. Get down, get down! Fire! Hold your fire! Hold your fire, hold your fire! Move down, men! Let's move. All right, men, come on down. Careful. Easy, spread it out a little bit. Go to the left. Hold a steady bead. All right, all right. Cover me! So they ran off and left you to die. Well, you'll live long enough to be delivered down to Clayton, New Mexico. You must be Dimaio. Well, you might as well shoot me right here. It would be a kindness. Shooting would be unlawful. Throw him his shirt. Let's get him out of here so we can all breathe easy. Get a horse for him. Damn. Double damn. We could ride in there shooting. Yeah, and die trying. Look, even if we sprung him, Black Jack would never make the run. He'd die trying. Like I said, we got no business being in this business anymore, Butch. What the hell is that? More Pinkertons. We better find us another trail out of here. This hand's played out. Whoa! What in the Sam Hill is going on, Mr. Caldwell? The Wild Bunch. They waited till the southbound out of Trinidad. Started through the pine brush, then they blew her in half. Cleaned out the express car before we could back the engine up. Tell him, Abernathy. Yes, tell me, Abernathy. There's three of 'em, madder than hell and meaner than a den full of rattlers. Liked to have shot my head off. Same ones as in the picture. Say, where'd he come from? He's in that picture too. Shut him up. Who's the other fella? Says his name is Brady. Helped us round up these horses. For that service, I'm much obliged, Mr. Brady. Do I know you? Never met. Mr. Brady was a passenger on the southbound. These your horses, Mr. Brady? Nope, I borrowed them. Well, then you won't mind stepping down. I'm commandeering that animal to transport Black Jack Ketchum to a hanging. Whose? His, and long overdue. Please step down, Mr. Brady. You'd leave a man afoot in this country? A healthy man who could stand the walk? Yes, I would. Mr. Hayes, leave a full canteen for Mr. Brady here. Mount up, men. Here, Mr. Brady. Three days to Clayton, men.

Well, lookee here, a parade for him. Hello there, ladies, it's so good to see you. I was just on my way over to the church just to give you my love offering. Hold on, Ma'am. Let's talk about this for a minute. You know, we really should discuss this for just a second. Now please, ladies. Now wait a minute. Hey, I got a permit just like you do. Now wait a minute. Okay, we got a special going on now. A nickel a handful. Sin shall be trampled from the face of the Earth. The sinner shall be condemned to burn in everlasting, everlasting torment. Torment! Yes, repent and ye shall be forgiven. Repent! Talk about your sin and sinners, that there is the biggest sin of all. We should lend a hand. Kershaw, I don't think them ladies need any help. Oh, come on, Cooter. I think we oughta stay right back where we was. Great job, ladies. We'll take over now. Thank you very much. ♪ I want to go now We'll take over now. Don't you worry about a thing. Oh, you will, will you? That's right. And I promise you this man will not sell another drop in this town. It's nice to have a friend in this town. I thank you, Ma'am. My mama taught me well. She certainly did. Ladies. ♪ Mine eyes have seen the glory ♪ ♪ Of the coming of the Lord Give me your hat. Go get a bottle. Go get two bottles. Maybe we can sell some of this. You got a complaint? Or are you just trying to get in out of the mud? No, Sir. I need to see your prisoner. You and everybody else in town. He'll be making his final appearance along about sunrise tomorrow. Now, sheriff, the rest of the town may be able to wait, but I can't. You're the one that, you're him. It's him. Lynch. We been wondering when you was gonna show up. It's best that the rest of the town be occupied with other matters when George Lynch rides in. Less notice that way. Things go smoother. Body weight and neck size, they all figure in. If you do it properly, it happens just like that. Condemned man never feels a thing. He makes it sound almost painless, doesn't he? Getting a little anxious, ain't you? I do believe I have till morning. Well, I didn't figure on seeing you again. Another time I'd thank you for the loan of the horse. But you can see where he led me. Y'know, you looked familiar back in them hills, Mr. Brady. You still do. It's Brady Hawkes. I thought so. I seen you clean out a house back in Cripple Creek. I never forget a face. Well, if you're so good with faces, take a look at this. This is the picture that near ruined us all. Goddamn Pinkertons on their high horse. But I never thought of you as hunting bounty, Hawkes. Cards turn cold on you? Tell me about the boy Jeremiah. Ain't much to tell, he hasn't done much. Can't be too high a bounty on him. Stationmaster says he's one mean kid. Why do you want him? So he can wind up in a dark little godforsaken cell? And he can watch a bunch of strangers build a gallows that's gonna hang him? Young Smith has got nothing to worry about from Black Jack. Except Young Smith is a Hawkes. Jeremiah Hawkes. He's my son. And he's 19 years old. And until three months ago, he was in a fancy boarding school learning an honest trade. And I need to find him. I rode with a lot of men in my time, good men, and some real bad ones, but I ain't never finked on nobody. So you can take whatever secrets I got and put 'em in the grave with me. What if he was your kid? I never had any. None that I know of. But you sure as hell had a father. Help me find my boy. Do you really think there are 13 steps to the top? Yeah, that's about got it. I'll plane this down here. You're welcome. Come on, hon. But I want that one. You got that one right there. Thank you. Now go show your papa. here he is. I'm surprised to see you here, Mr. Hawkes. I'm sure you are, Mr. Dimaio. It's a terrible thing to see a man hung. I have no interest in seeing a man hung or seeing a man live who deserves to be hung. You've come an awful long way on foot, Sir, to see a man you've got no interest in. And thanks to you, my only interests are a new pair of boots and perhaps a hot bath. Get your Black Jack doll! Gentlemen, for the brave among you, it is chance to win 100 silver Yankee dollars. Beat fair and square the world-famous Bruno, the battling bear. A chance is only $5, only one to a customer. Dimaio give you boys time off? They'll take anybody's money in here. And the ladies do wonderful things for brave men, strong men who have $100. Who makes the rules? Three rules, stay in ring one minute, you win. Knock Bruno down, you win. No stay the minute, you lose. Come on, get him. Lookee here, we done died and gone to Heaven. It's harvest time, Cooter. Just like ripe peaches ready to pick off a tree. 10 bucks on the bear. Come on, bear! Go get him now! Excuse me. Oh, I'm so sorry. Here, let me fix that for you. It's quite all right. Nice suit. No harm done. That's it, come on! There you go. Come on, get him now! That's it! How much did we get? Nearly $40. Bruno is the winner! No more challenges for Bruno? Bruno, there are no brave men in New Mexico. Will the ladies have no champion? Ah, my little (Foreign language). You are a very beautiful woman. Hey! You weasel! Why are you laughing at me? Huh? You don't think I'm strong because I'm small? Okay okay, I tell you what. I'm going to beat bear. Okay, I fight bear. No, this I will not permit. Impossible. Impossible? Nothing is impossible! I will fight the bear. You are too small! I do not want to take your money. Keep your money, save your life. Save my life? No! I tell you what, I'm going to bet any man here I can beat bear. This little bear, I'm stronger. I'll take the bet. Yeah, gimme your money, boy! Who's going to bet me? Come on, I fight bear. What do you say, 20 bucks on the bear? It's a sucker bet. Who's going to bet me? Come on, I'm going to beat bear. I will fight bear. Two to one, what do you say? I take the peddler. Three to one, and I say that little weasel won't last 30 seconds. I think he's nimble enough to outrun him. I'll take three to one. For $50. Let's go, come on. He's scared of me, huh? Come on, bear. Let's go, come on. (Foreign language) Come on, bear. Fight the little guy. Come on. Oh, he must be sick or something. This never happen. I think it was three to one, wasn't it, gentlemen? Well, it's not exactly all there. It's all we got. I got some. He's never done this before. I don't know what is wrong with my baby boy. Don't move, Bruno. Always bet on the bear. I won! I win, I win money! I hear you do a damn good imitation of George lynch. Leastways, the sheriff tells me so. I had some questions I needed answers to. I did what I had to do. Care for a nip? Not tonight, thank you. I don't care for it much myself. There was a time when I could get through the night before with just half a flask. Now it takes the whole load and then some. Yeah, when you think about it, there's a mother, midwife, maybe a doctor when a man's born. But you schedule his death and you put it on a calendar and people will come from all over the territory just to see the spectacle. You appear a man of the world. Answer me a question, why would an outlaw with a guarantee of hanging give himself up and not go down fighting? Why would he put himself through all this? Life is precious. The last thing anyone of us wants to give up is hope, hope that the trapdoor will jam, maybe the rope will break. That's all he's got. Well, he doesn't even have that with George lynch presiding. Let me ask you another question. Did you get the answers you were looking for from the condemned? Not yet, Mr. Lynch. Have a good night. Help, help! You brute! Stop! Somebody, help! Are you okay, Ma'am? I'm fine now. Boy, I'm glad he came along when he did. I was afraid I was gonna have to start kissing you. You'd had a fight on your hands for sure then, Kershaw. Shut up. Come on, let's get out of here. ♪ In the sheaves ♪ Bringing in the sheaves ♪ We shall come rejoicing ♪ Bringing in the sheaves ♪ Bringing in the sheaves ♪ Bringing in the sheaves ♪ We shall come rejoicing ♪ Bringing in the sheaves The lord is my shepherd, I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures. He leadeth me besides the still waters. He restoreth my soul. He leadeth me in the path of righteousness, for His name's sake. Yea, though I walk through the valley. Excuse me. Of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for thou art with me. And thy rod and thy staff, They comfort me. Excuse me. Black Jack. I don't think of no man friend or otherwise, Mr. Brady, but I had me a daddy once. But if I'd have listened to anything he said, maybe I wouldn't be on my way to have breakfast with the devil this morning. Go on, get up there. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12. Oh my god, I trust in thee. 13. Let me not be ashamed. Let not mine enemies triumph over me. Show me thy way. Teach me thy ways. Lead me into the truth and teach me, for thou art God. Hood? No. Last words? A man should never be hung in the mud. And if any of you ever get to Fanny Porter's Hell's Half Acre in Fort Worth, you be sure to give her regards from Black Jack. Will teach ye sinners in the way. All the paths of the lord are mercy and truth unto such as keep his covenant and his testimonies. For thy name's sake, oh Lord, pardon mine iniquity. Thou preparest a table for me in the presence of mine enemies. And I'll see you Pinkertons in hell! If the devil will let you in... Oh, mother, I can't look. Let me help you, Ma'am. Why, thank you, Sir. Gentlemen, that's your man. Remember, like glue on a board, like a shadow on the wall, no excuses. Mm-hmm. And don't get caught at it. Isn't this exciting? I don't think I've ever been this excited. This is the most exciting event I've ever been to. She's my favorite singer, did you know that? Isn't this exciting for Fort Worth? Kershaw. Kershaw. Hmm? We'd better get out of here. I think we got trouble. Welcome to Fort Worth, Miss Langtry. Mayor Horace Carson at your service, Ma'am. Thank you, Mayor Carson. I can't tell you how pleased I am to be here in your fair city. I travel a great deal, you know, and from what I understand, Fort Worth is to the west what Paris is to France. Excuse me, sorry. Brady. You're the last person I ever expected to see in Fort Worth. I'm sorry, my good man, but we're trying to present a proclamation of welcome to Miss Langtry from all the citizens of Fort Worth. I'm so sorry. Where was it anyway, Brady, Denver? It was San Francisco and it was one of the greatest performances I've ever seen. Was that during the show or after? Miss Langtry, I would like to present to you a key to the city on behalf of all the good citizens of Fort Worth. Why, thank you so much for this great honor. It will be a pleasure for me to sing tonight for you, for all the good citizens of Fort Worth and for all they stand for. We have a private carriage for you, Miss Langtry. Why, thank you, Mr. Mayor. Mr. Hawkes and I are most appreciative. We have dear old times to talk over. Perhaps I could see you after the show. Actually, Lily, there's no time quite like the present. Shadow on the wall, Sir? They're still out there. They're not leaving till I do. Who are they? That's two of Pinkerton's finest. They're like vultures, circling the kill. They're after you? I wish to the good Lord it was me they were after. You know, I've spent half the money I've won in my life on my son's schooling. Now it looks like he's thrown it all away. He's 19 years old. Hell, he's on a wanted poster. God only knows why. But if I ever get my hands on him. If you ever get your hands on him, Brady Hawkes, you'll hug him. You'll tell him you love him. He's your son. Don't throw that away. I had a daughter, you know? Lily, you never told me that. I haven't seen her since she was five years old. Not because I didn't want to. She's in France. I often wonder what she thinks and if she still loves me. Why do you suppose I do this, Brady Hawkes, the acting, the singing? Because I know they love me. And if you could do it again? I can't. Neither can you. But there is one thing we can do over again. An actress always loves to be asked for an encore. Excuse us. Thank you so much. Mr. Hawkes, Miss Langtry's private box. Thank you. She said she'll expect you backstage after the show. Thank you. Thank you. Jolly good. They're lovely seats, Darling. Yes, lovely. Featherstone, Julius. Smith, John. My wife Alyssa. How do you do? This is our fifth occasion. Yes, Alyssa and I, we saw Miss Langtry at the Orly in Paris, twice in London, once in New York at the beginning of this tour and now Fort Worth, where the West begins. Very exciting, isn't it? Oh, I'm so excited. Ladies and gentlemen, Fort Worth proudly presents the one, the only, Miss Lily Langtry! Not now, Mayor.

It's Andover, in case it matters to you. Of course it matters to me. Who do you think's been paying for it? Your mother said you would never go farther west than Savannah. When was that, maybe 10, 11 years ago? I needed to find you and tell you that.. Tell me what? That you were gonna give up your education and join a group of thugs? They're gonna get you killed. Damn fool stunt. I've never seen anything like that in my life. As if you gave a damn. Don't you talk to me that way, boy. I am still your father. You've been no father to me. You know, sometimes you're so much like your mother. My mama's dead. Come on, Fingers, he's not the only one. Whole place is full of Pinkertons. We're half a step away from the jailhouse, kid. But he's not.. Get a move on! Jeremiah! There he goes, get him! Blazes, they're going back inside! Whoa, not that way, come on! My God, it's the Wild Bunch! Get 'em! Use both doors! Hey! Kid, come on, let's go! Butch, come on! ♪ Let me call you sweetheart Jeremiah! Jeremiah! Don't panic, ladies and gentlemen. The Pinkertons have everything under control. ♪ Let me call you sweetheart ♪ I'm in love with you Butch, go, get him out! On behalf of all the good citizens of Fort Worth, I. Mr. Mayor, you don't want to know what I think of the good citizens of Fort Worth. Jeremiah! Come on, fellas, over here. There's a way out over here. Don't panic! No shooting! How ghastly! Looks like they got us now, Sundance. This way! Come on! Kid! They're getting away! Who in the blazes are you? The Wild Bunch, nice to meet you. Jeremiah. What a show! This is where the West begins. Give it up, kid, you're under arrest. Drop the drapes, son. You don't have an act that can follow this one.
