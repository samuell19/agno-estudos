So, here we have... something very special. It's a Boskoop apple, first class. Grown on a south-facing tree. It would be a special product from Lake Constance, where this apple likes to grow, because the ground there is very fertile. Well, you can assume, right? Try again. I'd like for you to reach the point where you're sure I'd buy the apple. So we come to a very special quality contained within apples of this variety: their aphrodisiacal effect. Adam and Eve? Adam and Eve, yes. I always like to ask the question: Why did Adam take this apple? Was it the person who offered the apple? Or the apple itself? That's the secret apples keep. Thank you! You're welcome! I can see that you're giving off a different glow now. So... I would buy that apple. Happy Birthday, dear my little, dear, dear Adrian Happy Birthday to you. Blow them out! That has nothing at all to do with our form of government. It's about being manipulated with constant repetitions... ... and then you get so much information. Piles of it. - Yes, okay. So you'll be be a... - Superfluous information... - ... media scholar! Media scholar! I won't become a media scholar. I don't want to support that shit at all. Oh, my dear! Happy, happy, happy, happy, happy, Happy Birthday. A triangle. Who's first? I'll start. Use that finger, not that one. - Leave me alone. Do I still have one more? Hey! Hello, hello. Hello, okay, bye! Listen, Claire. Now it's all about communicating. Just don't rain shit on my head when I'm climbing. It's just your ego: you feel your masculinity under attack... ... and now you're holding up a female issue like communication. You think I want to puzzle everything out again... ... on that "communication" level? You can't change my mind. I'm sorry, I wanted a clean break, and here you come... I don't want to cough up every detail again. It's over! Really! I'm sorry! Why do you have to make a big deal out of it? Why can't you just accept it? I thought it was a big deal. But maybe I was wrong. Can you give me something to put on? It's cold here. Give me something to wear. It's not so difficult. My God. Looks like you answered it all yourself. Don't you think? You think I'm an asshole? But what's so great about that guy? That he does poetry slam or what? No, really, what's so great about him? I can write poetry too. I'm also creative. But you can't write. I can too I'm learning very fast. You're learning it fast? Yes! No, really. I have... Really. Should I warm up a pizza for you? Or what else do you want? You bring me the pen again? Pardon? No, I'll bring you the pen again. And what are you doing here, Ursula? I live around the corner. Thought I'd drink some tea. And then I saw you and thought: I'll chat with him. Yesterday I was with my son at our summer house. In Schorfheide, you know? Very nice. I was wearing this, but then I had to go teach ballet. And then I kept it on during ballet class. And it's fine. It's fine. Because I also bought some new deodorant. It's great. He could have moved out already, at 20. Pretty slowed down- to live at home when you're 20. Yes, you're right. I breastfed him for too long. Oh! Me, too. Couldn't take the nipple away. Take it away. No, but that's a problem. I think I was breastfed for 1.5 years. I couldn't stop so easily. I took the nipple away abruptly but I think... ... a half-nipple still remains and won't go away. This is Adrian. And those are his daughters from another relationship. There we were on the beach, but I don't remember where. And that's now. So then it's been about 12 years since. Could be, sure. Very cute, that one. He described the people in the book like he really knew them. And this young man as if he had loved him. Like a gay relationship. I think he was gay. Yeah, that's what they say. You can tell when you read it. He liked to smoke Mazzinis. Mazzinis, is that a cigar brand? A type of cigarette. But really naked as well? And also really spreading your legs? I'd really like to see that. Then I always said: "Fuck me. Fuck me! Deeper, deeper!" Some customers always said: "Hello, how are you?" Now I think that's already cool. "Fuck me, fuck me." "Fuck me deeper." So, show it! Yes, I mean it. Now I'm curious. I'd like to see it for myself. I could also pay you in poetry. Then we could perform together. Right, we could just do a poetry-slam-tabledance here. For philosophers. For people who just... For philosophers? I think more the kind of old fart who ... under the cloak of literature, just wants to look at you. Oh, like I'm always quoting from Thomas Mann! I'm smoking my Mazzini now. Where's my Mazzini? Give it to me. I'm your cigarette. Let me dance for you. Yes. Oh, how hot! Yeah, hot. - Deeper - Turn me on. Please light my fire! Oh, roll me. I love it when you roll me. Roll me, yes. Tonight I want to be turned. Tonight I want to be turned. Snap off my filter. I love it when you roll a filter into me. But I think Mazzinis didn't have filters during Thomas Mann's age. So I'd have to say: "Put your filter in me." That's stupid. Yeah, a little stupid. But to be honest, I always thought she was a little I mean, Saskia was cool somehow but... I don't know, she was She's one of a kind... She has a mind of her own. If I fall into the crossfade, I'd be falling two meters. It's a little stuck here. - I've got stones in my shoes again. Please bite down. So your jaw will be cut open and it'll be shifted a few millimeters forward. A few risks may turn up, such as it becoming swollen... or your mouth stays numb. Are you familiar with soccer? So there's Franck Ribery. He had a sore heel and nobody knew where it came from. Then he went to the dentist. The dentist operated on his tooth and afterwards, the heel pain went away. As I said, the teeth have a lot to do with other organs. You should carefully consider having the operation. I personally would advise against it. But what's the alternative? I can't talk right. I can't even clearly articulate myself. There are other methods, like speech therapy. Already tried it for a year. Didn't work? Didn't work. I thought of it more as a confirmation of what was clear to me earlier... I've alrady been to 3 or 4 other doctors and the operation is now set. But I'd listen to what Dr. Raschke said. Look at the things he's already done. And what were you feeling? Just now? Wonderful. And now another rhythm. This one's really more difficult. Again. Three, four. Okay, do it again. One more time. Look, I'll guide your hand. At the moment, I use other means to get through the day. What kinds? Drugs? No. What then? I'm currently writing. Music was always an instrument to communicate things. They used to send secret messages from one country to another through music. From Hungary to Germany in the 17th Century. It's still the case today, but now it's just commercially exploited. Yes, yes. Keep going! But boy, you should focus on your music. And you'll make it boy; you're gifted. You also have the music in you. I see it in your "ping." And your mother wants to as well. - Yes, my mother. Your mother is a very, very nice woman who only wants the best for you... ... but you don't give it to her. You want to be a chicken now? Come on. Let's jump. But I'll count. 1, 2,... ...look ahead. 1,2,3, and go. Yes, it's still a... A work in progress, but I can read it to you. Provisionally. To attain it all in so little time. To have nice black clothes, that'll never fade. To eat delicious food and never shit. To live a free life on a silk thread that'll never rip. Fresh meat from animals who themselves chose to die. To be in a t-shirt on the December streets and never freeze. You're Herr Pol... Polan, right? Pusar. - Pusar. Right, sorry. Rainer Draengler. - Hello. Sorry for running late, but it's because of traffic, etc. I was in a traffic jam. Yes, okay. - Yes? You can get into the car, and then we'll drive on down. I've got 1,000 keys right now. We'll see which is the right one. Can I get in now? - Yes, you can get in. Parking garage. Solid construction. There's still a little of the old building to be seen here. It's been sealed against humidity, so if you have a specialty car it won't rust in here. Then I'll show you something very special here. It's a so-called "lift garage." The cars are stacked here. Do you smoke? - Yes. Cigarette? - Sure. Please. That would be the object of envy. Sorry, Herr... er... we didn't pay enough attention there. Pusar. Herr Pusar. Right. I'm really sorry. This was once a factory, so these floors can still bear some weight. And in order to preserve its originality, of course, we left them in here. They'll last. You can theoretically still drive a truck in here. It's solid and warm. You can sit on it with a naked ass. Damn it, shit. That shouldn't have happened. Come get on my shoulders. - Piggyback. But be careful. So: two balconies. Accessible from the living room and from the bedroom. Look around a bit and then tell me what you think. The bath is via the bedroom, if you want to make that your bedroom. With a down payment, we could come to an agreement... ... that would stave off the other customer. I could show him a different one. I first need some time, um It's rather a lot... all at once. Sure, but please look around. You haven't been in the bathroom yet. I think you've got to press a button or something. Is that, that... Yes, yes, yes. - Great, huh? That's unbelievable. - Yes. A great invention. You save paying for a cleaning lady. She'd cost 12 euros an hour,... ... this thing needs less than a kilowatt in an hour. Yes, I'd like to go down. Now this fucking thing's down. Can you go to that column? "To be in a t-shirt on the December streets and never freeze." That's good. No, really. - And here it comes "To dive for hours without an oxygen tank." "To always find another 10 euros in your pocket." "All the dogs in Berlin shit flowers into beetroots." - That's right. - "And from the pile of shards, 1,000 butterflies fly." Don't know it? - No. I don't know it. So there's this Chinese guy in China with a bag of rice, it spills out all around him. Right? So he doesn't go to work. Because he doesn't go to work, where they make shoes in a factory and he's on the assembly line... And because of him, the company goes bankrupt. And if you weren't able to buy those tennis shoes... That means you wouldn't be able to go jogging, you felt restless, and because of that, you needed sex. And therefore you brought my dad over to fuck you. Ah, good! And because you fucked him, I came to be. And so if the rice bag hadn't fell over, you would've had the shoes, gone jogging, and never fucked my father. My goodness. I'm teaching my mother a lot. For real. You're very smart Adrian. - I know. Really very, very smart. Yes, hello, Rainer Drängler. Who is this? Herr Pullmann! Yes....okay. Yes, okay. I'm now a little confused, it's probably a misunderstanding... One second, I have to clear something up, okay? Thanks. Herr Pusar? - Yes? Yes. I don't know exactly what to say. Did we have an appointment today at 4:30 p.m. or not? - Of course. - But now someone else is... Well, that's not your problem. Yes, so are we going to sign the contract or are you... Yes, let's sign the contract right now. Well, okay then... You just need to fill in your personal data here and then... My glasses! Will you please stop! Those are Armani. Yes, hello Herr Frank. I need the spare key. I locked myself out. For the apartment on the 4th floor. Yeah, it was a dumb mistake just now. But I've got a customer waiting and he has to... It's no better outside. Hey Adrian, it's totally nice outside. Is everything okay? I think the flush is... it's not working. Hey, are you bored or something? - No, I'm a very touchy-feely person. You know, Adrian, you sometimes come across like an old man. You've got no energy at all. Man, man. Okay, Adri, you don't want it any other way. Look, I'm stronger than you. You won't get away. You won't get away, I don't think. Listen. I'm your mother. I'm stronger than you. You won't make it, I'm stronger than you. Oh Adrian, that's unbelievable. Adrian. Wait a minute, Adrian. One moment. Put on your clothes. It'd be embarassing if you went out like that. If the neighbors see... Really. I am truly stronger than you. Hey, let's go have a swimming contest. Oh, leave me in peace. - Oh please, please, please. Let's go swimming. - Harshest mother in the world. Sometimes pretty women are rare, and sometimes there are too many. Sometimes you're the star and sometimes, more like always, things are all the worse. And I sit in my room with my self-pity, And dim the light with a dimmer. Sometimes I'd like to beat pretty women with my old broomstick. Sometimes I'd like to beat pretty women with my old broomstick. Songs of praise for the masses. No I won't do it. Love stories for the everyday. There aren't any. Why aren't you doing it anymore? - It doesn't interest me at all. Tell me, who's paying for the whole nonsense? You're a great talent, you know? Oh really, Adrian you can make me so mad. Then let's put aside the nonsense, and have your thoughts... ... instead of making music, doing something sensible for yourself. And then I'll consider cutting off your allowance. And then you can see how you'll make ends meet. You're going? Where are you going now? I don't have any money or tickets. - Yes, that's your problem. Is it my problem? Do you want to play hide and seek? Okay. I will start, ok? I'm coming. No, not yet. Not yet. I need a little more time. I feel quite silly here under the... Can you straighten your leg? - No, that's totally uncomfortable. Okay. I can't get it out. Oh, Franz. Oh, yes Franz! Oh, Franz! Hey, who is that then? - Who? Adrian? So you leave me sitting in your fucking summer home... ... and then you continue your life just like... Adrian. ...like any other day as well? - Adrian. I don't know who you are, but... - I'm Franz. ... I really don't care. You know what kind of trouble I had to even get here... ... to even come to the city? I can imagine. Oh, I'm so sorry. Can I hug you again? No. Okay. Excuse me, but it's raining heavily outside. Can I take your umbrella with me? Yeah, sure. I have a question. Do you have to play music? Come again? Do you have to play music? Why? Yes. Why? Why not? Aren't there other things that are maybe a little more important... ... than noodling around here and adding sound to all these superficial people? Hi. - Hello. My name is Markus. - Anastasia. Come in. - Thanks. Did you come here on the S-Bahn? We should continue. Could you please take off your shoes? My shoes. Oh, I see. Can I take off my socks too? - Yeah, sure. I think that has to stay on top. - Okay. Hello. - This is real couchsurfing here. Maybe you have to... Whoa... I can't continue. I'll get my finger caught, I know it. I've also never used it before. Careful, be careful! Shall I bring you a little something to eat? I'm not hungry, thank you. Smell this. That smells very good. I don't care for them. I just wanted to ask if you did the flowers... So you can estimate 400 square meters... ...divided between these two floors, yes. I'll check the floorplans. So just to make sure I understand, the whole balcony is... Yes, I'll show you the boundaries. Ah, bravo, bravo. Not a young man without talent. That is... that's a stately balcony. You can say that. - Can't say anything against that. Can it be controlled electronically? I do a lot of work on paper. I mean, a lot in my head and on the page. Are you a painter, a sketch artist? - Poet. Poet? - Poet. Litterateur. You write books?- Exactly. - I understand. And it's good for me when my hands are free. When I have... ... a good idea, and then I notice I need a little fresh air... ... and then the door opens for me and I can go directly... ... onto the balcony and write more and then say: ... "Okay, I've put my thoughts on paper". Then I can go back in and close it again with the push of a button. How does it look? Will that work with your finances? That part here. I think.- Sure? - Yes. With or without bank loans? What do you mean? Will the bank partially finance it, or are you putting down the whole amount yourself? Well, if a bank were to finance part of it, that'd be alright by me. You can talk, get some air... - Oh God, I think I feel faint. I think I feel sick too. Hello? Oh. Put some clothes on, man. Sure. Excuse me. I'll cancel my appointments tomorrow and we'll stay here. Wow. And we'll order breakfast. You turn down your money for a couch surfer? How irresponsible. Doesn't matter. If it's worth it? I know other irresponsible things that people do. Oh, I'm excited. Excuse me. Oh, help. It's so romantic, I could die. I have to sleep. Let me go. Oh, you're so heavy. Can we go? Can we go? Can we go? I heard your question, but now I'm thinking: is there something to report that I should know about? No. - No. Good. Well, then. Good luck. Thanks. Thanks a lot. ...over the vein, and it's extremely rare that someone could possibly awake. That's specified. Well, it's no big deal. It's more an interest in how it all proceeds. Now you've got to gradually find yourself a nice dream. Excuse me. Hello? Are we already done with the operation? The operation is over and you're now in the recovery room. Very good. High five. High five. This'll continue to run a little bit, and then we'll see how it is, okay? Okay. Ah. Shit. Okay. Yes. Then it was a pleasure and get well soon. Okay, see you tomorrow. Ciao. Good morning. Hello. Still tired? So I have to... Want any coffee? Okay, it might be that I can't pick up the phone. Can we... I mean, can you... can you send me an SMS when we... yes... okay... When? 6:30. Yes, I'll write that down. I can do that sometime this evening. I'd really like to call you right back. Is that yours? Where are my things? Carolina? Yes, Markus is here. Good morning. How are you? Yes... Where'd you put my things? It's so repulsive to imagine what you're going to do with that. Look for your stuff and don't blame me for taking it away. Did you wear it at night? - It was over there. Bah, it stinks. Of you... Hey! - Hello. Come in. I'm Danny. - Anastasia. Was it easy finding it? - Yes. Very easy. Easy. Wait a moment. Just some tap water? Hmhm. Where do you come from? You wouldn't recognize it. A small town in hicksville. What do you have in all those cupboards? They're really big. Yes, they're giant, I can't even get up there, I mean, 'cause I've stashed away body parts up there. Yeah, so would I. No one can get up there. I'm just joking with you... Well. I can cook something later if you like. Just let me know. Cool. I can cook too. But you can probably cook better. Yeah, but if you need anything from me... Or if you've got a recipe or whatever, I'd be interested in it too. Really, in recipes? - Yeah, I mean. There are... I sometimes have guests now who aren't from Germany and it's a little like being on vacation. Well, indirectly. Like someone bringing the vacation to you. Do you want a little wine or what? I have an open bottle. Sure. Then you throw the one from there over there. Yeah, I think I can do it. Wait a sec. Yes, and the second one has to be thrown as high as the first. At the same time? I can't check it. Oops. Just like this. Hm no, just explain it to me again. And it shouldn't be thrown so high. Ah, let's just drop it with the balls. It isn't so important. You haven't yet drank all your wine... Well, I also am no longer thirsty. It was tasty, but... Did you just drink out of that one? Only my own. Do you want... I don't know if I got too close to you earlier or something,but if so I'm sorry. I don't want you to feel that I want anything... sexual from you. Well, I hope I didn't make that impression. Didn't you want to inspire that impression though? Sure, I'd want to... I... I've slept with some couchsurfers now... ... and I don't find anything wrong with it,... ... but if you don't want that, that's okay. So no hard feelings and I won't write you a bad reference... Okay, so should I go now because I'm not going to sleep with you? No that'd be embarassing for me, because I'd feel like I behaved like an idiot. Of course you can still sleep here, but it's just embarassing. Unless you actually do want to sleep with me, and I... misread the signal. Well, I wanted to sleep with you, but now I don't want to anymore. So where can I go around here? Is there anything nearby? You mean a hostel or something? ... or do I have to sleep with them too? Heh. - Sorry Did you take pain killers? I haven't taken any pain killers today. I've some IBUS left. Yes, so what dosage? 400 mg, 500 mg? No, 800 mg, but you can split them up. Does it hurt right now? A little. - Yes? Hmm. So when I hold it up, then the muscles twitch. I can't quite see that. No, today today it isn't twitching anymore. And there... - Be careful, don't hurt yourself. Excuse me take your hand out. And up here Oh, okay. I see it. There's nothing. With the microphone, how close do I have to go? Look at what the others do. About that far. About that far? - Yes. Ah, you're taking part? - Yes. Cool. Super. You too? No, I'm just a spectator. I come now and then here and watch. I see. Yes Looking forward to it. But you shouldn't overextend yourself, I mean because of the operation and everything. No, no. I'm now at the point where I want to see it through, regardless of what's coming. To be honest, the problem is that I forgot the fucking second half of this poem at that was the best part. Just now? Really?- Yes. - Shit. And all the rest's for nothing and I'm already being to stiffen up on the inside. Can you remember approximately what you wrote? Yes. I should just act as if that's all that I've got. Then I'm... ...already taken away, right? So when you say in advance that you excuse yourself for that which you don't have... then nobody knows, I mean, nobody knows. I'd just do what you have. But that'll only last 20 seconds and the slot is five minutes long. But can't you? Um... I haven't written so many poems in my life, but I did write one. Yet now I don't have half of it, because I lost the rest of it. And... that poses the question of what one doe when one stands so exposed on the stage and lacks all preparation. How can someone say something without constantly asking where the statement actually comes from? and in my case, I feel kind of faint. My teeth are... ch-chattering and then I feel like aspen leaves or sawdust ejected from a large saw and, when I ponder whether or not I should go on-stage and then determine that I'm already up there, then I feel really like a little runt. Now I feel much better already. I'm gradually feeling better. I feel almost well and notice pins and needles in me, which some call courage, and I notice also how my eyes blink and I slowly become alive and I have the feeling I'm sitting in a carriage and someone's hitching a horse to the front and I could now go anywhere, only I don't know where exactly. But maybe it's also not so important to know the goal but to just drive off and also when things I say don't rhyme. Thanks! Locked in this racket of liberty full of violence, desire and haircuts. We are the generation the dictatorships have left to die on the gallows, but demand justice Anyway, until next time. Practice well and it'll work. For me, you're the real winner. Thanks. I just didn't have my text with me. Fuck it. What you did was cool. - Really? That was stand-up. That is that was simply something different. I really liked it. Because the others, they Poetry is always the same old appearances and you did something totally different. That was cool. That was just cool. Thank you. - Keep it up. Thank you. Oh God, did you look to see what I had in there all my bodies or No. - There's a gun in there. I just wanted to... - What? Do you regularly attend follow-ups? Yes. Every day. Every day? Yes. Every day, I come to you. And you have to care for me and... and see that all is well. And... you have to give me some cross-training because I've forgotten everything. I can't do it anymore. I'll do that. And you can just smoke like that? Did mama let you? I didn't ask you at all. Whohoo... You didn't ask your mama. Who is my mama? So I'm your nurse, and also your mother, if you like. I'd like it. I'm totally into the fact that you're so mature. That you're so, that you're... I think it's totally sexy, yes. That you emanate a certain life experience. Isn't that funny that I'm finally at the age of maturity. That's funny because I was always used to being a certain age and being young and not being mature and everyone else around me were mature. And now I'm mature. But you also come across totally young. I am mature. Yes, but young as well. So, so, so young and mature. Is it full? Yes. Totally. Where is it? - And it's where? Yes. - So you go over the railroad bridge. To Kreuzberg Right over there. Does "Freischwimmer" ring a bell? I don't know directions from here. I see. Just go straight over it. Then you'll see the Oberbaumbrücke. Hard to miss. And right after it you go left and stay along the waterfront. You know what? No, mom. When Adrian comes, then we'll tell him: "Adrian, you're no longer Adrian, you're Franz." Exactly. And then I'll throw a fit about why your boyfriend ...who is obviously too young for you, is coming over. ...And keeping me from practicing my triangle. On my triangle! Yes. Yes. Don't we want to brush our teeth? - No. Okay, then we won't brush our teeth. You'll have to hold out for now. - Okay. Okay. - I'm holding out now, okay? Do I have to hold out the entire night? No, you'll be sleeping later. Okay. I will be sleeping later, you mean. Franz? Yes? Could you come over for a bit? Please. Bah! That's shitty. But was that on earlier? Yes, I think it was on there. I didn't know how to move it. Let me in there for a minute. Do you have a few you don't want to burn? Yeah. A few What? So it isn't frugal literature. But rather? I've never had a proper appetite, but now I'm really hungry. I want a giant piece of cake... ...and something with a lot of sugar. Don't we want go in? What? - Don't we want to go in? Why? Do we want to go in? Okay. Franz, can I ask you something? - Yes. When you're performing what you see as your best for me, can you situate yourself somehow position yourself outside yourself and play pretend? Yes. Okay, do you want to put on something different? Of course. I mean Are you against putting on some of Adrian's clothes? Wait I've got something for you. Very formal and very much like he is. You know you've seen him. So now I'm chic enough for you? Am I chic now? You're super handscome. But now you have to be like Adrian. Try to assume Adrian's role now. I don't know Adrian that well. Adrian is like: "I don't want this." I don't want this. "Oh, go away." Something like that. So I pursue you and you push me away. Okay. "I could smack that worm wriggling on my hook and yet catches no fish. And then I'm forced to sit at my desk and hoping that I can catch my thoughts fresh too. Who says that people who are sitting can think better?" I don't have any more text. I'll just say whatever very freely. And then I won't have any more text. Now you've got to put down the notebook. - Yes. and you have to say: "I want to go out. I don't want to be here." Okay. But with my stiff member too? Yes, you don't want to be here. I go to bed and say: "Oh, come to bed for a little bit." Or no, you go to bed and I'll come in a little bit. Okay. My sweet, small, sweet, sweet Adrian. You must love your mommy very much! You may touch me a little. Yeah, now you may switch a little between Franz and Adrian, okay? Could you stick your finger in my ass? Yes, wait. Just like the thermometer when I were younger. Yeah, okay. It looks like a fever. Is it nice? It hurts. Hurts? - Yes. I should stroke you a little, and then it'll get better. Oh mama. Look, I've got to go. Now I need I need to confront nature. I need some time away from these penis thoughts. Kanta landa makara. Takalancino si vuje kala lara. Ta laka panta. Po karonte mos ta dio. Stella del patrone a la mio. Adrian? Look at the moss that I just crushed. There are more circuits and little living networks than in the best computer. Adrian who gave that to you? I'm totally overcome by nature out here. I mean, this whole imagination, did you get that from your father? No, it just comes It just sprays out of me. Sprays? Yeah, and now I'm totally here, totally rising up. Oh, how that creaks and groans. Now I'm completely wet. I didn't invent the rain. - But it's totally annoying. Okay, but I'm still fond of you again. You're so tightly wound! What's wrong with you? I don't know either. Oh, man. Man. We have to go over there. - That's where we're coming from. Do you even know you're contradicting me yet again? It's the same every time. I'm always doing what you want. Why every time? We just came here for the first time. No! - Why "no?" Every time when I come out here with you I participate in this shit. Here it leads us into the forest and there back home. Can you please address me by my own name? I don't know your name. You don't have to just communicate with my earlobe. What's wrong? But a little beating and yelling, screaming and swearing is also fun for you, right? I've never hit Adrian, you know? To be honest, I don't give a shit about Adrian. I don't give a shit about what your son does. It's not my concern. I don't know your son. I don't want to know your son. I have no investment in your sick family relations. Well, fuck off then. Then fuck off! Well, keep the papers! You know what you don't understand? Maybe I'll be going now, but I was already gone long before. You don't understand because you live in your own little world. You also ordered the view along with it, huh? Sure, it was expensive. It also works well bringing customers here at sundown. It probably distracts people from the drawbacks of the apartment. I mean, I don't know any other drawbacks with this apartment... ...other than that the sun cannot set and rise on both sides. So this wall here, this can still be redone for example? Of course. You could maybe throw up some graffiti or whatever. You can do it however you like it. Exactly. This is probably 60. That's probably 60x60, right? Yes, round about. So that's the guest bathroom. The larger bathroom is front. And this is the pissoir. Oh, I see I'll go out for a sec, sure. You can stay there if you like. I don't want to disturb you now. I'd say that's more than a little sudden. Sure. Um, I'll just leave for a sec, okay. Yes. Are you done? No. Uh, do you maybe have some tissues on you? Nope. Yeah, so what should I do now? You're wanting to sell an apartment for 1.7 million euros and there isn't any toilet paper. Well, it's also relatively uncommon for people to go to the bathroom. I can run downstairs and see if there's any. Yeah, it's already after 8 so I'll have to run to the Kaiser's market. They're open 24 hours. Or I'll check with the neighbors, okay? Yeah, could you get some toilet paper for me? Ah, thanks. I'll make sure the faucet's off. I already shut it off. It just pontaneously came up, I sometimes have problems with that. I see. Yeah, I found it a bit surprising. I'd almost want a gas stove. I don't know if that's possible. Gas is very nice. Very nice. Has more flair. Also visually, when you look at it. It's just nice to have those flames. And that gas noise always reminds me of my mother. May I ask why? She was also A passionate cook. Yes. She always liked to be busy at the gas stove. Yeah, yeah. But that's just this.... What did you do then? - I leaned on the wall. It's really on there. Well, then I'll call you. I'd really like to stay here for a little while. Can I just be alone for a little bit... ...to let it work its magic on me for a while? For how long exactly? I don't have to speak with the bank about it. If you formulate it like thus you've got 10 euros and you... ...want to buy something for a euro, no one asks about it. That's, well sure. Was that a large butcher shop or a family operation... ...or a slaughterhouse or something? First it was a small, tradtional family butcher that then expanded its range of animals and then... because the animals got larger, became larger itself, and then... ...at some point the number of animals increased, and so that's why... the whole business exploded into a large company during the middle of the 80s. And since most people eat meat, we had no trouble with demand. But that's very beautiful with the skyline. It's beautiful, yes. Really. With these colors. Come, let's go. We really have to I'm in a hurry and... we've looked at everything over the past 3 hours. Sunsets Sunsets... ..we've had a trip to the toilet here What'll they think if I sink 1.7 million euros into this and can't even see the sunset here. Yeah, they wouldn't believe you had 1.7 million stashed away. Either come out or close the door. Then they'll stay outside. I'd like to stay here. Alright. Now you're coming with me. You can't stay. Really, I'll have to use physical violence if we don't leave here. I don't want to know. I don't care- we're going. I just would have liked to know if
