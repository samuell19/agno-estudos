It's all right, I'll be right back. So can I come over later? I can't stay long, I'm just gonna pick up the manuscript and run. I can come in for a little while, I just can't stay long. I have a date. I think it's a date anyway. No. No, why do you think I would do that? I have I ever shown any signs of getting back together with him? No, that would be you who would do that, not me, you're projecting. Listen, I need to get back in there, okay, bye. Okay. A friend of mine just got here, I have to go. Well, they're gonna call me, right? So there's nothing I can do? Listen, I really have to go. All right, see you tomorrow, bye. Who was that? My supervisor. It sounded like you were talking to a telemarketer. I wish, I wish she was into telemarketing. So where's the manuscript? Oh, right. Where is it? Thought you said you found it? I did, I just pulled it out this morning. So how did it get lost if you just pulled it out? Hang on. It was under something. Thanks. So you got up to page 25. I told you I wasn't finished with it. Yeah but, okay, thanks. I'll finish it if you give it back. Okay. I'm going out for a smoke, come with me? Sure. The landlady won't let me smoke in here. Can't blame her. I tried it anyway, she was up here instantly. People have superpowers for detecting other people smoking. If I'd been selling a body part, no one would bother me. All your old landlords will never be able to get that smell out. They have to tear the building down to start over. Some of that smell is from your cigarettes, you know. Yeah. So what'd your supervisor want to talk about? Nothing. One of my cases went missing a week ago, two weeks ago with her whole family. They followed the welfare checks and found them in a different area, so another social worker is taking over and I need to do knowledge transfer. Was it so urgent she had to call you at home? No. We found out about this days ago, I think this gal just gets lonely and picks up the phone. Really a sweet kid. Family's a piece of work though, I hope this new caseworker's good. So what's up with this date? I can't tell if it's a date or not. You remember David Marshall? Of course I remember him, he's the date? Yeah. Well that's bizarre. Where'd you run across him? He gave one of the aides at school a ride home from work. Turns out he's a writer, and he's a reader for Electric Literature. I told him I submitted a story there, so he wants to have dinner and talk about it. So, it's a date if he was just pretending to care about the story, and it's not a date if he was being honest. Well, no one ever hook up to say you had to be honest about it. What I really want, is a dessert. You're not interested in him? I don't know, I don't know him really. You know him well enough. Is that aide his girlfriend? He asked me to dinner right in front of her, so I'm guessing no. He is good-looking. He looks better now. Really? Yeah, he lost weight or something. He was wearing a suit with his tie loosened. Did he seem nervous when he asked you to dinner? No. As cool as a cucumber. Yeah, of course he'd be cool. I say he's trying to get in your pants. You know, you have this tendency to think that, people are insulting you when they try and fuck you. Just take it as a compliment. The trouble is they like actually, literally insult you more often than not. There's no such thing as a literal insult. It's just a phrase. Don't use it, you're destroying a perfectly good word. You wanna come with me? For what? A dessert. Where? The diner, on Rogers. I'll walk with you. Jo says hi. Jo Mitchel? Mm-hmm. You still see her? Oh yeah. How's she doing? She's pretty good. What's she up to? She's a social worker. Really? Mm-hmm. She works with adolescents. She's working with some state agency. It's great that you two are still in touch. You two were always a bit of an odd couple. Really, how? You know. Jo can be a pretty tough customer. Yeah, I guess. Cutting is the precise word. She can be very cutting in her comments. Did she cut you? Not me, per se. How do you like your job? I don't know, it's a tough job. It's kind of exhausting. Jennifer is completely exhausted all the time. The gig is really putting her through hell. That's a good description of it. I guess I shouldn't be talking to you about how much she hates her job. It's cool. I just assume in advance that anyone who has our job would hate it. Everyone hates it? Yeah, basically. Teachers aide jobs are a lot of work and they hardly pay anything. It's really hard to get a full-time education position, so people bounce around in these aide jobs. I'm working on getting my Masters part-time. I'm getting close to finishing, and hopefully that should expand my options. So, so you guys work on your degrees, while working these killer jobs? Yes. And you do your writing on the side, in your case? Thank God for summers. I liked your story. Thanks. I was expecting something different. How so? It's very quiet, not a lot of frills to the writing, I like that. Why'd you make the central character a man? It was just based on a story a guy told me. True story? Kind of, there really was a squirrel who got sick, but the real life guy didn't take care of it the way the character does. Was the little girl real? No, I made her up. What about you? You're not a quiet writer? I've been a bad boy. I was always trying to get attention and people gave it to me. Now I just want to communicate, it's not that easy. You haven't read any of my stuff? Don't read anything yet. Give me another 10 years. Thanks for dinner, it was really nice to see you again. It was nice to see you. Let's do it again. Yeah, that would be great. Thanks for everything, goodnight. Goodnight. Hello? You've got the right number Mara, this is Josh, Jo's... Yeah, I've heard a lot about you, too. Yeah, I just grabbed her phone 'cause she's asleep and I didn't want to wake her. She lost her job this morning. Yeah, she was blindsided. I was blindsided for sure. She was pretty upset about it so I just didn't want to wake her, I wanted to let her sleep it off. But we're on, we're totally on. Yeah, she's looking forward to it. Yeah, I see you know her well. Yeah, don't worry, I will get her there. Yeah, it'll be great to see you in the flesh, at long last. Do you know where we're meeting? Never mind, I don't need to know where we're going, she knows. Okay great. All right, I'll see you soon. Yeah, I'm excited about it, bye. Hey, what's going on here? We've been displaced, man. The goal is to violate the spirit of the law. The goes is load up on as much risk as you can, without getting caught. So they're just completely out in the open. Completely out in the open. They just openly talk. Take your worst idea about corporate culture, and double or triple it, that's what it's like. It's a totally different universe. Do they know you're a pinko democrat? It doesn't come up. I don't have a lot of heartfelt conversations there. The people I hang out with are mostly the Indian guys who do contract work. What's it like being in the middle of that, though? Doesn't it get to you? I guess I'm just used to it. I've been working financial jobs a long time now. You just do what you're paid for, and hope these guys don't bring the world down. I know I'm not gonna show up for morning meeting. This is not gonna happen. That's the whole reason I picked a job where I could set my own hours. When's the last time they spoke to you about anything? They never spoke to me about anything. Well they spoke to you that one time, right, when you missed that appointment? Yeah, but they said that wasn't a problem. I mean at the time they were fine with it. What they really cared about, was me missing the dumb-ass morning meetings, which lots of people miss, not just me. Well Jo it sucked they didn't give you any warning, but for future reference you should make a little mental note to yourself that when people tell you they don't care about lateness and no-shows, they are lying, and they really do care, no matter what they say. I mean, you've been here for how... It wasn't about that, I don't even think it was about the meetings. This supervisor and I have been butting heads the whole time I've been there. You think she wanted you gone? As far as she's concerned, I was just put there to make her life difficult. She's a total stress-ball, anything new or anything challenging just freaks her out. I tried to organize regular group meetings so we could compare notes. She just wants to do one-on-one supervision because that's what she's used to. That's why I tried to set up a support group for the staff at my hospital, because the doctors can be so fucking insensitive to women there, and so on and so on. How's the job market? It's good, they're desperate for social workers. I just have to, I have to file some paperwork. What kind of paperwork? My continuing education. There's a form you can file. You get an extra year if you haven't completed it. You mean you have to take some classes before you can work again? No, I just have to file this form, and then I'll work while I'm taking the classes. You want to file that form right away then, right? Yeah. You know where to find it? No, I can ask someone. I can help you with it later on, okay? You don't want to leave this hanging. I won't. We'll do it later. Your hands are cold from the beer. Warmer? Yes. This is hard to do with your shirt and bra in the way. Better? A little. You want me to take 'em off? This girl is the love of my life. I don't care, I'll take 'em off. Keep your fuckin' bra on, Jo. It's actually a really nice, expensive bra. But to him it's just something in the way. That would be an accurate description of my priorities. I have drawers full of nice lingerie that are going to waste because he doesn't care. What can I say? It's not my thing. Me neither, actually. Not into the frills. Fancy lingerie makes me feel like I'm in a play or something. What's wrong with being in a play? I don't know, I can't pull it off, it makes me feel silly. How do you feel about lingerie, Jonathan? Who me? He's into it, I can tell. Right? Sure, I like lingerie. I saw you perk up when I mentioned that drawer of underwear. Just sitting here minding my own business. It's nothing to be ashamed of. It's not weird to like lingerie, is it? Don't mind her. Of course not, of course not. But all the incompatibility in this room, so sad. Lingerie incompatibility. Everyone's with the wrong lingerie partner. Hey, no swapping, I like this one. Do you know the name of the department that wants the form? It's the state education department, isn't it? Don't ask me. Yeah, that's it. Registration renewal. There's an email address here that you have to write to to get a registration renewal application. I've got that already. You've got the application? Yeah. Well, what do we want then? I've got that, but I need to file another form with that form, because I didn't do my continuing education. Yeah, okay I see it. You can file a registration renewal addendum. That's it. You can file it, but then you have to do all the continuing education from the last three years. Yeah I know. And this year's too. Yeah yeah, I know. Okay, I'm sending you a link to this form. Did you fill out the original form, the renewal? I'll do it. That form's online right? That's what it says here. They sent it to me on a piece of paper. Can you get it? Let's get it filled out now. All right, wait, I have to find it. I wish you had a full-length mirror somewhere. Sorry, I can get one if you want. You should get one, just put it right here on the bathroom door. I make this big embarrassing confession, and then you go off to the bathroom and leave me here to stew. I wanted to have a clear mind to discuss it. We do not need to discuss it. I just said it because... Because I asked you, right? Right. So go ahead, it's cool. I don't know what else there is to say. I could give you an origin story. Okay. It's not really an origin story, but it's the origin of me thinking about it. The origin story is, one time years ago I went to the movies with two friends, female friends, and they sat on either side of me, and I wound up holding hands with both of them at the same time, and it was extremely strange. It was totally different from holding hands with one person, and I got so distracted that I couldn't pay attention to the film, and now I can barely remember a single thing about it. That's the origin? Basically. I don't think it had really occurred to me before then. It's not about watching two women do each other. I mean, I wouldn't kick them out of bed for that, but it's really more about me. What, about the two women doing you? Well yeah, about the two at once angle. So like, no personalities? I don't know, I wouldn't put it that way. It's not my philosophy of life or anything. No, it's fine, I'm just thinking out loud. I would consider doing that for you, if we could figure out some way that wouldn't be like, catastrophic. I really wasn't trying to put it on the docket or anything. It's just not that easy to pull off from a social point of view. Yeah, no shit. Jo's the one person I could think of who would probably do it, but I would totally never ever do anything like that with her. It seems pretty awkward with anyone. Yeah, maybe, but definitely not with Jo. I would feel as if I weren't even there. I thought you said she was a bit of a basket case? She is a basket case. But she would make you feel as if you weren't even there? This is weirding me out even to talk about it. Okay, let's focus, instead of Jo I swear, this is making me think about the right qualifications for the job. It has to be someone who can play a role, a secondary role. I have a friend, Susan, who has the exact perfect personality for the job. She would never do anything like that, she's very straight. All the people who are non-threatening enough to work are the ones you would never ask. That's really sweet of you to be putting so much effort into my little fantasy, but really it's okay. I'll keep thinking about it. Thanks for service above and beyond the call of duty. Yeah, maybe later I'll think about it and be like, did you actually say we were gonna do that? Uh oh. What? Hi. What's going on? What's the matter? Why are you crying? I don't see what you're so worried about, what are you afraid is going to happen? My mom is in town, I have a plan with her tonight. Well, she's my mom. I know, but she's still my mom, and when did I ever not see my mom when she was visiting? Oh, he's okay. Yeah, I mean he's all about the deficit and the gold standard, and that kind of thing, but basically he's okay. Okay. Okay, if you really need me to, I will cancel with her. Should we meet somewhere? All right, I'll come over when I'm done here. No, I can't, I'm tutoring. I'll text you when I'm almost there. Okay, see you soon. Hi. Listen, I'm really really sorry but, yeah. I really apologize, it's Jo, there's some kind of emergency. Yes. Knowing her she might cancel on me but, something's wrong at least, she's really in bad shape. Yeah, I don't know. Thank you so much. You don't mind being at my beck and call, I don't want to hang you and Paul up. Okay. Thank you for being so nice. Maybe I'll see you later then. Okay, bye bye. Sorry about that, we'll make up the time at the end. You don't have to do that. How's it going? I can't get it. - 25%. - Yeah, I have that. Of, what's of? Times. The budget. What's the budget? I don't know. We don't know what the budget it. - So that's X. - That's X. Is. Yeah, I know. Fuck! Hey. Josh hi, is Jo home? She's dead asleep. Listen, I canceled some important plans because she basically begged me on her hands and knees to come over here. I'll totally take responsibility for waking her up. She's not gonna wake up, she's down. Yeah, she's down, okay. Leaving. Listen, do you have any clue what's going on with her lately? I have no clue what happened today. The last I heard from her was two weeks ago. I got the same call that you got, except that she wanted drugs. So she's been alone? I just assumed she was hanging with you. I wouldn't say she's been alone, exactly, but she hasn't been hanging with me. What kind of drugs? Oxies. So that's what she just took? Yeah, and she's been drinking Wild Turkey. You think it's a good idea to give her drugs? I don't see how you're gonna stop her. You think if I'd have said no, she would have left it at that? I don't think it's a drug problem. Well, they don't seem to be helping any. I've seen a lot of drug problems, and it's something else. I'm not too so sure, I can't tell what's what anymore. It's something else, she needs to see a doctor or something. I'm backing off, I can't deal with it. She'll have to start solving her own problems. Or not. I can't be the point man on this anymore. It goes in cycles, right? Oh, thank you, what a great idea. I haven't finished my last one yet. What were we talking about? You and Jo, you've had a lot of ups and downs. I guess. I always feel like the last time was the worst time. My perspective is shot. Are you following all this, or do you need a scorecard? Obviously, she has some problems. Can you get her to see a doctor, a shrink? She's seen lots of those. She chews doctors up and spits them out. So a new guy? Yep, new guy. What, is something wrong already? No, nothing's wrong. He drives me out of my fucking mind half the time, but he's a good egg. What's he like? I don't know, what's anybody like? He's like a big puppy. Lots of enthusiasm, not the most practical guy in the world. Whoa, you always draw these hot guys. No I don't. You most certainly do. He does look good in this picture actually. You want to meet him? When? Tonight. Tonight, I don't know. What are you doing? Nothing, just going out. He won't mind people barging in on his date? He won't mind. We'll go to JFK first, then just stop by. I don't know, I'll let you know later, okay? Sure. Can I bring someone? Of course, who's this? The guy I'm seeing. Why didn't you mention this guy before? I don't know, you didn't ask. Hmm, I owe you money. Oh. and 80, 200, 90, I have the other five somewhere. Don't worry about the five. Wait wait wait. Thanks. Thank you. I told you I'd pay you back. So what does Tim do? He is an actor and a musician. What's he do for money? Works at some bakery in Tribecca, and another counter job too, in Williamsburg. What kind of music does he play? Some kind of jazz. I haven't heard him. Seriously, you've never, like you haven't seen him practice or anything? You just vanished. I got a brownie. You make me so mad sometimes. What? Here's this paper you wrote in school, and not only is your writing style beautiful, which I knew already, but you can tell just by reading it, that you've gone beyond the basics and you have a whole philosophy about whatever, family therapy. Structural family therapy. I'd give my eyeteeth to have that kind of, a tab on things. I think you're a genius with kids. Yeah I know, I'm good with kids. Is the 'support of girlfriend' issue again? No, I don't need support. Well, I'm sorry I make you angry. I'm going out for a smoke. Did I tell you I'm gonna quit? No. Waiting for Tim to get a remedy from a friend of his. Anyway, be right back. So, she's a little bit distracted, isn't she? All right, go for it. Oh yeah, you can tell? Yeah, of course. The way you talked about her, I expected something different. Different how? I don't know, more of a glamor girl. You don't find her attractive? God no. I mean obviously she's pretty. She seems like trouble. She is trouble, she's definitely trouble, but guys usually like her. Not my type. It's funny, I've known her for a long time. I guess I see her differently. Believe it or not we have an actual supplier for basic supplies. This is why you have like notebooks, papers, pencils, pens. I've had to buy so many things like that with my own money. There's a lot of things that aren't perfect about this place, but we're basically really lucky. There's an actual budget. The administrators basically care about teaching. The told me they had a budget for supplies, but they told me that at the last place, too. And you were at PS 261 before here? Yes, I was an aide there. This is actually my first full-time gig. Awesome, congratulations. Thank you. Yeah I was at PS 29, and then I was an aide for two years at 261. You were at PS 29? I was an aide there, 2012-13. Oh wow. I missed you by one year. So glad to be out of there. Oh my God, the kids were so sweet though. Yeah, but Helen Anderson? Did she write you up? Everyone got written up. It was a badge of honor. She even liked me and she wrote me up. Did she ever come into your classroom and yell at you in front of the kids? She yelled at the teacher, all the time, never me though. Mara, Tim, Jo's friend. Uh huh, look, there's some serious shit happening here. I'm sorry to bother you, but you're the only person I could call. A knife? Oh my God, is she okay? I don't know, I didn't stick around long enough to find out. She's crazy enough to use it on me. I, oh I'm not going back in there. No no way, I'm not going back. Well did you call the police? Okay, okay. I'll go over there. Look, I'm sorry, really sorry, but there's nothing I can do with her. Okay. I don't know, I don't know where, I'm just going in the opposite direction, I don't know where the fuck I'm going. Okay, all right. Bye. Hey, it's me. Listen, there's something crazy going on at Jo's, so I guess I'm going there. Please call me when you get this. What are you doing here? Tim called me. He called you? And you came all the way down here? What happened? Nothing happened. He was terrified, he said you held a knife on him. I did not, I was nowhere near him. If he thinks that was holding a knife on someone, he's got a lot to learn on the subject. He also said you were holding it to your throat. It was just a little feta. He irritates the fuck out of me sometimes. Where is he? I don't know. He was far away from here as possible it sounded like. Okay, fuck him then. You want some ice cream? Yes, please. Poor girl, what a night. Do you think she should be left alone? I don't know. She seemed fine. I don't know what I could do about it anyway. So what do you think is going on with her? I have no idea. She always said she would never do anything to herself no matter how unhappy she was. It's like a tenet of our weird relationship. Anyway, I don't want to talk about it anymore tonight, okay? Okay with me. Come here, I want to show you something. What? No panties. Yep. That's what you wanted to show me? Yes. Well. Move forward a little bit. No wait. Okay, now come this way please. Hello. How have you been? Hi Mister Mitchel, I'm good. It's nice to see you. Sit down, would you like a cup of tea? Um, sure. I think Jo's still asleep. Do you want me to look in on her and see if she's up yet? No, let her sleep. How's she feeling? She's doing well. She wants to go home already. She's still sleeping a lot though. She slept all through last night and most of today. Sounds like normal Jo to me. Yes, she likes to sleep. The doctors wanted her to stay with us for two weeks, but she's already talking about leaving. Has she said anything else about what happened? No, not since the hospital. I don't like to ask about it. That boy she was with doesn't seem to have been the best influence. He hasn't been around for a few weeks, though. I don't know. He gave her the substances she said. When's the last time you two saw each other? Last Monday, we went to the movies. Oh really? You girls have kept in touch all these years, haven't you? Oh yeah, we keep in touch. How did she seem to you then on Monday? She seemed fine. Come in. I heard you downstairs. Yeah, we had a nice chat. Did you tell her anything about all that drama with Tim? Good, the less she knows, the better. Wow. Everything's different now. It's been a guest room since I was in college. Strange seeing this room again. You think it's strange for you, I'm going nuts here. Is your mom getting to you? Just average. I really want to get out of here, that's all. But I'm supposed to stay here a couple more days. Big price to pay for a dumb mistake. How are you feeling, I mean apart from wanting to get out of here? Back on the fuckin' Lexapro of course. They made you? Basically. Well maybe that's a good thing. Whatever. Check back with me if I ever get a sex life again. There's nothing left for me in this town anymore, like I was erased from the town history. That's a privilege. Let's go get a really nice dinner or something, as soon as I get back. Sure. Hi, Mara? Hi, yes. Hi, I'm Conor. Nice to meet you. Come on in. Jo's just getting dressed. Do you want me to take that? Yeah, thanks. Excuse me, I just gotta keep an eye on this fish. Do you want to sit in there? Jo should be out in a second. Okay. Can I get you something to drink? Sure. Should we open the wine you brought? What are you drinking? Scotch. Can I, that sounds good. Of course. The wine can go with dinner. Indeed it can. Did you know what I was making? I did, a little bird told me. - Hi. - Hey. Damn, I should have worn something nicer. Well great. Can you do the bow? You're giving away my favorite part of the job. Girls do it faster. Come on, leave the maestro to his work. Jo, can you get her a scotch? I'm gonna have a beer. Okay. So, why couldn't Adam make it? He's out of town, I thought he might still be here, but didn't happen. Where is he? He has a job out of state, didn't I tell you? Oh, where's he working? Boise. In Idaho? Wow, is everything okay? Yeah, we didn't break up or anything. He had a job offer he couldn't refuse. Geez. You know what People Soft is? No. He does a particular kind of programming. It's this pretty famous software that companies use for human resources and stuff. But most of the jobs he's offered aren't in New York. Literally none of the jobs he's offered are in New York, so he's in Boise for four days, back here for three days. For how long? Six months, maybe a little more. Yeah, it's a rough commute, but it's... Where is it? Glen Oaks, way out in Queens. Just take a subway and then a bus to get there, which is a drag but, it's no trouble once I get there. The clientele's pretty good, workload's pretty light. Have you been getting there on time? They don't care too much about that. They're just so glad to have someone in that position, it's been vacant for like five months. What time do you have to be there? I have a lot of leeway, unless I have an appointment. Let's hope their idea of leeway is the same as your idea of leeway. When did you start? Monday. Monday, like two days ago? Yep. Sorry. Excuse me, I've got to take this. Hi Corey, what's up? No, there's absolutely no reason that she should need more time. The longer this goes on, the less. He's sweet. He's a good guy. I like that he's older. Guys our age are so exhausting, they're just like all over the place. Do what you want to do, but I'm telling you... You usually prefer those exhausting types though. Really? Anyway, this is nice. He's amazing in bed. Exhausting in a good way. But does he like you enough to let you smoke in the house? No, no, no fucking way. He'd kick my ass right out the door if I ever lit up in here. He wouldn't do that. He does not like cigarettes. Does he like you? Not that much. Sorry, I had to take that. He's never done anything. Is that right? I wouldn't say I've never done anything, but I have never done any drugs. - Not even marijuana? - Nothing. He's done nothing. Not even marijuana. You know what this says about you, don't you? What? That you're more uptight than you come across. That's probably true, but how do I come across? But, you drink? Yeah, sure. You don't smoke? No, I tried cigarettes in my youth, and cigars. So that's not completely a trope out of an uptight person. That's more of a... I don't think of myself as uptight. No one thinks of themselves... A civic-minded profile, a law-abiding profile. Were there policemen in your family? No, my father was a criminal, actually. What? No, not really. He ran a hardware store. My mom was a high school teacher. Ah darn, that would have been a nice, tidy little psychoanalytic profile of your personality. We knew some cops if that helps at all. It might help, if they were like surrogate father figures or something. No, not really. You're Irish, you grew up in Boston, you know some cops. But you were a good kid, it sounds like. Yeah, basically. And now I wind up with a girl who smokes cacti. You haven't wound up yet. Smokes cacti? Of course you don't smoke cacti. He just likes to say that, I'm tired of correcting him. I didn't know you ever did anything with cacti. I had some cuttings. You're growing them? Mm-hmm. Got them from John, he used to work down at Mount Sinai. We'll see how it goes, there's a lot of work to trip that way, I'm too lazy. John's way into it though. I have a lot to discuss with this John guy, if I ever meet him. He's a jealous guy. You have nothing to worry about, believe me, ask her. It's true, she is very monogamous. And we also thank John that I'm being irresponsible with those. What? I didn't say anything. You want the rice too? Okay, sure, thanks. I'm going out for a smoke. I'm leaving too, I'll walk out with you. I'm going out, follow me out there. I guess she couldn't wait. She's not a big fan of waiting. With you too? With anyone. It's definitely not about you. Thanks so much for coming over. Thank you for having me, I had such a nice time. I really appreciate all the things you've done to help Jo. Sure, no problem, I haven't done much for her. I hope that you'll stand by her. Of course. I'm not going anywhere. Goodnight. Goodnight. Hey, where are you? I'm here, where are you? Sorry. Yeah, like. No, I have to go too. I really do have to go. Do you want? I'll call you, bye. Hello, I need a ride to JFK airport tomorrow morning. 177 Kingsland Avenue. The plane leaves at 6:55 a.m. so I would need to be there 5:55, six o'clock or so. Okay. Okay thanks, how much is it? Okay let me get right back with you. Okay. Have you talked to George? No. You know they're in town. I'll call when I get back. Here you go. Thanks. You're welcome, enjoy. I guess I should eat, too. She's not coming. I just talked to her a few hours ago. I'm sorry you have to deal with this. I needed to eat anyway. Your back's gonna hurt you again. It'd be easier to sit straight if you could raise that computer. I'll sit straight. Who is it? It's me. I'm really really sorry, we were supposed to meet for dinner. Are you okay? - Hi. - Hi. I'm really really sorry about dinner. It's okay. Can I come in? I was all ready to leave, and then I stupidly fell asleep. Did you wait a long time for me? We waited and then we ate. I'll be back in a while. Jo, see you later. Where are you going? We have to talk. Doesn't look like that's gonna happen, anyway. We have to talk, there won't be time tomorrow. We'll talk, goodnight. What's going on? We're having some problems. Oh God. I'm sorry. I didn't know if I should come tonight, but I really needed company. Jo. I didn't know about you two, I'm really sorry. Honestly, if I'd known I wouldn't have butted in. You would have known if you called before. Showing up at like 12:30 in the morning. I'll go. It doesn't matter now. I'm sorry if I messed things up for you, I'm sorry. I know you're sorry, you're always sorry. Let me apologize. Jo, what does it matter? It's always the same. Some shit happened to you, and then the people standing near you - get shit all over them. - Stop it! I need you to be nice to me. I know but you need something all the time. It gets difficult. Did something happen? My agency won't return my calls anymore. You sure? You sure it's not something else? Yeah I'm sure, it's because I fucked up too many times. When's the last time you tried calling them? It doesn't matter, even if they call me back, it doesn't matter. - What do you mean? - It doesn't matter because I fuck things up. Even if they call me back, or I get a different agency, I'll just fuck it up again. Why am I telling you this? You're the one who tells me, you're the who says I should go on disability. Are you thinking about that? For a while now you've been going in this circle. I know, I know, I know, I'm a fuck up. Stop saying that. I'll say whatever I want, if you don't like it you can throw me out. Disability is a big doctor trip. I can't stand dealing with them anymore, they're so arrogant, and they're always wrong, they're always wrong, every single time. I know I need to get my medications straightened out, I know I can't keep going this way. Maybe I'll find, maybe I'll find a doctor who'll actually let, who'll listen to me when I fucking tell them. You know you give doctors a hard time. Oh I feel just awful for them, they are so delicate. You get locked in these death struggles, everyone loses. What do you mean, death struggles? What do you want me to do? I don't know, they prescribe something, you unprescribe it, someone's gotta be in charge. I want someone to be in charge. I would be so happy to have someone in charge. That is all I want. But they're just so... You said, you try to talk to them, and then somewhat really early in the conversation, their eyes glaze over. And that's it, everything you say is wasted. They've made up their minds. I've been watching their eyes glaze over since I was 14. 14? I knew you then. Of course you knew me then. Why do you say 14? I don't know why 14, I wasn't always like this. My life wasn't always this fucking hard, I was always good at stuff. I was good at school. Why am I telling you this, you know that. You missed a whole month of school that one time. That was when I was 14. What happened? Nothing happened. There's no thing that happened. I don't know what happened. It was your dad then. Do you remember that? You were so miserable, it was totally ruining your life. No, why would that ruin my life? It's been fucked up since the beginning of time, that's not any sort of breaking news. Damn it! There's so many things that could be reasons, but they're not, they're not, they only all are, which is the same thing. It was the time we started drinking, doing drugs, but I stopped, I stopped doing them a million times, and if being sober made any difference I would know that by now. And then they started medicating me, but I stopped that too, a million times. Was it just puberty? You can't, you can't do anything about that. The only thing that I want, the only thing I would think about. What? My cat. What cat? My cat, the one who died. Cindy? Why did she have to die? Everyone has to die. I don't care, I wish she wouldn't have. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to be hurtful. It's okay, you weren't hurtful. I sound so crazy. I just want people to see past my eccentricity and my anxiety, and see me for what I am. Your eccentricity and anxiety aren't part of who you are? No, they're not. You want to hear something heavy? What? I'm pregnant. Oh my God. How far along? Like a month and a half. So it's still in the miscarriage zone but. Should you be drinking that beer? Oh my God. I wish I had a recording of that. I think it's okay. Is it a good thing? Yeah. Look who it is, Lorelei. Hi Lorelei. Were you sleeping? No, she's very into literature. Oh your literature, are you reading all your books? Mm-hm, and then she has. Poor Lorelei. Does she have her food? Hang on, I'll get it. When did she eat? A couple of hours ago, so she should be hungry again soon. Where are you going? We're going to see my dad. How is he doing? He's a little weak, actually. The doc wants him to do physical therapy, but I don't really think that's gonna happen. He's very excited to see Lorelei though. How's work? Exhausting, I'm so out of shape. I feel like I'm running a marathon every day. Do you have her toys as well? I put a drawing pad in her bag in the stroller. Okay. I think that's everything. All right Lorelei. I'll have her back before six. Whenever, it's no problem if you're a little late. Okay, Lorelei coming with daddy? How's everything with Clarissa? I gave her the check for last month. Yeah, she told me. It's maybe how much of our conversation's about money. Terrific, I don't know what I'd be doing without her. Good, I was a little worried there for a while. She's amazing, thank you so much. Lorelei, time to go. Moving out mama. I know here, we'll take it with us. Take the blues, and purples. Okay, you're gonna have some clean up problem. You go back, we're going up. I will not stab you, you know this. Does he want to move out on his own? No, he wants me to move with him. He doesn't want any roommates, he just wants a bigger place. There's something in your hair. Does he work in the city? He works in downtown Brooklyn. So it'll be a longer commute for him too, but he doesn't care. I really don't want to move out there. I feel like we live too far away already. But I don't want to leave him. Does he know how you feel? I think so, we've never talked about it. He has a girlfriend. I have a girlfriend. It's all so fucked up, jealous girlfriends. But she's jealous of everyone, she's an equal opportunity jealous person. She has this special radar to pick up on the things that she should actually be jealous about. Sounds exhausting. It is exhausting but, there's a lot of wonderful things about her. Maybe I should just just let him leave, and find a new roommate. Finding a new roommate is so hard, even without all that mushy stuff. I know, I never had a roommate that worked out before. I went through three roommates in that one apartment. I wish I could just fuck his brains out, just once, and get it out of my system. I don't know, I don't think it works that way. No, you don't think. I think that if I just had one good long... I believe 'fuck' is the word you're looking for. I used 'fuck' already though, there's nowhere to go from there. Oh God. Holy crap. What? My friend, Jo. Hey. Where have you been? I don't know, where you haven't been, I guess. This is Thomas. How are you doing? Nice to meet you. This is Leah. Hi, you're the teacher, right? Yes, I'm the teacher. It's nice to meet you. She says the nicest things about you. So how's the baby? She's great, she's almost two years old. Wow, that's awesome. You should come and see her. Yes, please. I'm gonna call you tonight, okay? Sure. I go to bed pretty early these days, so I'll call after I get her to lie down. Bye. Bye. Nice to meet you. So that's your friend that you've known since middle school? Yeah. Oh my God. I didn't expect her to be so nice. I'm really sorry I'm late. Hey can I borrow some money from you? Sure, how much? Like 200. Could go to the bank for it. There's an ATM here, just remind me before we go. I don't owe you anything right now do I? Nope, you paid me back. Awesome, I'll get you back for this too, I've got some money coming in from my brother, it should be here in a week or two. Your brother? Yeah, my parents bought some property, and they wanted to give us the money from it. My brother's handling all the legal stuff, and distributing the money. It's been dragging on, but should be done by next week at the latest. Have you been okay for money? Mostly okay, I don't need much right now. Thomas and I got a place with Arthur and Jason, who you didn't meet. The cost is practically nothing. Belongs to a church, believe it or not. And Jason's brother does repair work for the church. I'm getting a new agency. A headhunter who is helping me is on vacation until the end of the month, but when she gets back she says she can place me. There's all kinds of demand right now. I told her I don't want to work mornings, she said it's no problem. How'd you meet Thomas? I met him on the internet. Not on a dating site, on a wiki where he's one of the admins. What'd you think of him? I don't know, I don't think he liked me. He's like that with everyone, it doesn't mean anything. He'd like you if he got to know you. What does he do? He's really brilliant actually. He's a deejay, kind of a famous deejay, but he doesn't really do very much of it lately. He's working on this like huge, incredible, design project. Him and Jason and Jason's brother, and this one other guy, building a three-dimensional model of the Pyramid at Giza. They've been at it for years, they're almost done. Pyramid at Giza? It's a spiritual thing. I don't understand the philosophy to be honest, but apparently pyramids are sources of spiritual energy. If you have about five hours of free time, ask Thomas, he knows everything there is to know about it. I don't think I ever heard you use the word 'spiritual' before. I don't even know what they're talking about half the time, I just sit there and listen and nod. He's incredibly smart though, he's a lot smarter than I am. I doubt that. How's Adam? We broke up. Oh wow, I'm sorry. It was coming for a while. How you doing with it? I don't know. I think maybe I'm one of those people who isn't supposed to have relationships. Sounds like depression talking. I don't think I'm depressed. Here. Oh, the baby. So when should I come see Lorelei? Here. Oh my God. It's me and Cindy. Where'd you find this? In a photo album. I don't remember this photo at all. No, this is for you. Really, you don't want it? I scanned it. Thanks. So when should I come over tonight? I mean, no wait I can't tonight. Not tomorrow either. How about a Tuesday or a Wednesday? Yeah, this Tuesday or Wednesday should work. Early is better for Lorelei, like five or six. Okay, thank you. Bye. I'm so sorry Johanna. I have to pick up Lorelei, she got sick. Oh no, what's wrong with her? I don't think it's anything, I'm so sorry to miss the meeting. - Go on, get. - Okay. Thanks. Fan fan fan fan. Can I? Yeah, of course. Here, here I go shrinking. And should I shrink something for Horsey? Does Horsey want something tiny? What horsey? This horsey, yeah. Shrink something for horsey? She said, and then growing up she said. Yeah yeah, okay, do you want a tiny apple? She said. Okay. Do you want any hay? Okay, she's not hungry. Lorelei, should I shrink something for you? Okay. Well that's good, because it's bedtime anyway. Horsey ready for bedtime? I know. Lorelei, are you ready for bedtime? Yeah? What bedtime story do you want to hear? The one about Jo. You want to hear the one about the girls picking on me, okay. So, I have just moved to a new town, and I only knew my mom. I didn't know anybody else in the whole town. I didn't have an Aiden, and I didn't have a Gavin. Did you even know your dad? Well, my dad, my dad was living in a different town. So I knew my mom. And, I had to go to a new school, where I didn't know anybody. I had gone to school at kindergarten with all my friends, but I had to go to a new school. And when I got to this school, I thought people were going to like me so much, but only the teacher liked me. There were some girls there, and one of them was really pretty, and one of them was really skinny. They were so mean to me. They made me feel so bad, I would get to school, they would find me and they would make me cry. I did not like going there, but I had to go because I had to go to school. And one day I was in the lunchroom, and everybody else was sitting at tables with their friends, and they were all sharing their sandwiches and they were sharing their desserts, and I was sitting at my table. I didn't have any friends. And the other people would see these girls be mean to me, and so they didn't want to talk to me. They thought maybe there was something wrong with me. So I had to eat lunch all by myself, and the mean girls came over, and they took my book bag, and they took my stuff out of my book bag, and they were using it. They used my pencils and my paper, and they took my food away from me. And they were making fun of the food I brought from home. And I was so sad, but Jo was there, and Jo was the tallest girl in the whole school. And she was so cool, and she didn't know me, and she could have been mean to me too, but she saw the girls picking on me, and she got really brave and she came over. She came over and she said, "You need to leave her alone. "Stop picking on her," to the mean girls. And the mean girls said, "Why would we listen to you?" And they were arguing with her. And one of the girls who was sitting in a chair, Jo reached down, she took the girl's chair, and she pulled it out from underneath her so fast, that the girl fell on the ground, and she made a sound that was so loud that everybody looked over, and the teachers came over. Jo got in big trouble. Do you know how she fell? Show me, show me. Make a big fall. - Like this. - Yes. Exactly, and she cried, she was like. Like that. Jo got in big trouble, but then she was my best friend because she stood up for me. We were together all the time. And other girls were still very scared of Jo, because she could be so, Jo could be really mean sometimes. She would say cruel things to people that she didn't like, but she was always so nice to me. And then, nobody picked on me anymore after that. Hello, my God. Yeah, I know, your name's on my phone, how are you? Something wrong? Oh no. How did it happen, do you know? I guess it was always coming. No, it's been more than a year I think, even longer than that since I really... I don't know, it got harder and harder. How are you, are you okay? Were you in touch? How did you? That's so good of you. I really appreciate your thinking of me. Oh my God. I guess I'd better call her parents. Thank you so much for calling me. Is there going to be? Yeah. Yes, of course, so I'll see you there. Thank you so much for calling me. Goodbye, I'll see you soon. So when we go to the funeral home, you'll wear your black dress. I'll wear a black dress, and there's going to be a dead person in the room with us, and we're gonna be able to look at her. You'll be able to see her too. Even for grownups it's a funny thing to see a dead person, and it's all anyone's going to be thinking about, that we're in the same room with a dead person. Why? You know, it's just, it's just to remind us that we're important and that people are important. It's important when we die. This is Mara, Jo's friend. This is my sister, Rose. We're sorry for your loss. Thank you very much. Oh hello. This is your little girl. This is Lorelei. Hello, Lorelei. Is there anything I can do to help, do you need anything? No dear, thank you. I'm going to call you. Thank you. Jack. I haven't seen you since that Monopoly game. You have seen me since then, several times. You know I won that game. Oh are you still high about that? Okay, you won, geez. Sorry that game marked you for life. They put makeup on her. Why? To make her look nice. This is Lorelei. Hello Lorelei. Hi. It's very nice to meet you. It's nice to meet you too. How are you, what have you been up to? Not much, just working. Been doing a lot of traveling. My girlfriend and I actually just got back from San Francisco yesterday. Oh that's so nice, I've never been to San Francisco. Yeah, it's a great town. Hello. That's Mara's little girl. Do you remember Mara? Jo's little friend from grade school? Did I know her? We saw her a hundred times, they went around together for years. Come with me, I'll introduce you. No, don't, I'll meet her on some happier occasion. You won't meet her ever again on any occasion, happy or not. No don't, I don't want to intrude. You won't go out of your way. Does your mother still live up here? No, she left a long time ago. She lives in Washington state now. Where in Washington state? Bainbridge Island on Puget Sound. Yeah, my ex-boss lives up there I think. - My father used to live... - Excuse me. Honey, what's wrong? Don't worry, nothing bad'll happen. It's Jo, Jo from the story. Yeah I told you that before. She's dead. I know, I know that she's dead. I'm sorry, I tried everything. I tried everything and I couldn't save her, I couldn't do anything. I'm sorry! Here you go. Thank you very much. Do you need anything else? No thanks, we're fine. I'm sorry I made a spectacle of myself. Can I have some pads and pencils? Yes. Where is your bag? It's right here. Oh, thank you.
