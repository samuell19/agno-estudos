(powerful theoretical music) (dramatic heavy metal music) (gentle music) (birds chirping) - [Pilot] CIC, this is Foxtrot Charlie One. I'm in position over the island and standing by. - [Operator] Roger that, Foxtrot Charlie One. Keep your eyes open. We haven't had contact with the ground team for over 72 hours. - [Pilot] Roger that. Stand by. (tense music) I've got something on the radar. Are you guys reading that? (chilling dramatic music) Oh, my god, it's some kind of giant flying reptile. It's enormous. Stand back request permission to fire. - [Operator] Affirmative, Foxtrot Charlie One. You are weapons free. - [Pilot] Ah, come here you scaly bastard. No, joy, he's just too damn fast. I'm hit! I repeat I'm hit! Engines on fire. - [Operator] We've lost radar contact. Abort the mission. Ground team is on their own. (dramatic music) (dramatic chord striking) (monster growling) (monster screeching) (tense music) - Did you see it? - Yeah, I saw it going down. (monster roaring) (suspenseful music) (monster growling) (monster roaring) (suspenseful music) (theatrical dramatic music) - We're dead. We're freakin' dead. - Pull yourself together. Act like a real soldier. - Recruiter never said anything about gettin' my ass eaten. - Look, we travel to exotic places and meet interesting things, and we kill 'em. Remember? - Yeah. - This is blue leader. Can anyone hear me? I repeat this is blue leader. Can anyone hear me? (garbled radio static crackling) Damn. - It killed them all. You saw it. You saw it with your own eyes. You saw the size of it. What the hell are we gonna do? - We're not gone lose our heads. You got that. Now on my count we're gonna make it out of here. Ready? One, two, go. (suspenseful music) (monster roaring) (guns firing rapidly) (loud screaming) (loud screaming) (monster growling) (chilling dramatic music) (monster growling) (loud screaming) (gentle music) (sea gull screeching) - Dammit. Lea. Lea, wake up. - Geez, I'm woke now what happened? - I don't know. I really can't remember it. Get up, help me with the others. Kaylee. Kaylee, wake up. Kaylee. - Ryan. Ryan. Ryan, get up. Get up, water. - Kaylee, get up. - What, what? - Quick get up the water. Get out of the water. Come on. Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa. - You okay, you alright? - No. - You, all right? I don't know; I don't know. - Where are we? - I don't know. (gentle music) - [Ryan] What happened to the boat? - No idea. Can't remember much of anything. - Maybe because you were so drunk. This is all your fault. - Can you please talk to her? I can't take this now. - Jason, you had a few too many drinks, okay. - Oh, come on, it's spring break. There's no such thing as a few too many. - Will you shut up, Ryan. This isn't the time to joke around. - Um, you know what, I'm sorry. We're stranded on a deserted island. No food. No water. No beer. - Wait. Wait, wait. My cellphone we can call for help that way. - Uh, salt water, technology it's really gonna work, babe. - Do you always have to be such a prick? - I mean doesn't this bother you in the slightest. I mean we're stuck out here. We don't even know where here is. - I guess that means Tori's not gonna be spring break queen. - Screw off, Ryan. - Ryan, we're all scared, and you aren't making it any better. And, Tori, now as I recall, you were slamming the vodka pretty hard. So, why don't you just knock it off with your drinking lectures. - But I wasn't driving the boat. - Uh, you stir a boat, Einstein. (Ryan chuckling) A swing and a miss. - You're such an idiot. (Tori sobbing) - You're such a jerk. - Baby, don't let her get to you. You know, she can be a drama queen. Three girls, two guys reporting for double duty, sir. - Just give it a rest! - What did I do? - Things are bad enough without you picking a fight! - I'm sorry. - I mean, what the hell are we gonna do, huh? I've never gotten into an accident before. - Dude, you gotta chill, man. You're supposed to be our fearless leader. - You said it yourself, we're stranded. - So, remember that time we were in Mexico we got lost. You got us out of that, didn't you? - Look around you. Do you see any place where we can stop and ask for directions? (heavy panting) - You better, man (chuckling). - Much. Okay, we need to figure a way to get the hell out of here. - That's the Jason I know and love man. What are we gone do? (helicopter blades whirling) - You hear something? (dramatic music) - What's that? - Don't worry about him, okay. He doesn't know what he's talkin' about. All right. - Oh, my god, what is that? - It's a big metal bird. - What's goin' on? - I don't know. Let's go find out. (dramatic music) (gentle music) (soft knocking on door) - Enter. You've got two minutes. Don't waste my time or yours. - Can you allow this to start all over again? - What the hell are you talkin' about? - Come on, three months ago the nightmare we created you're letting it happen again. - Look, I've got my top field commander on that island. My best man on the ground ready to do a tough job. - Your last best team is dead. You're doin' it again throwin' more innocent lives in a meat grinder. - Look, this is combat, doctor, search and destroy. Till we get this little problem taken care of. - Little problem! Eight people died General Morganstein, two of them were my colleagues. They're still missing. You've lost several good man as I can recall. - I had no choice. Look I gotta throw whatever and whoever I can at this mess until something sticks. Look, this is war. That's what these men get paid for. They get paid to go into harms way. They knew what they were getting into the day they enlisted. - I doubt if they could have ever imagined what you had in mind for them. Hell, you didn't even brief them. - Are you accusing me of callous disregard for the safety and well being of American soldiers, doctor? Hmm, please don't let my rank intimidate you just speak your mind go right ahead. - Look, there's blood on both our hands. I don't want anymore on mine. - And you'd been paid quite well for it as I recall. A little more won't stain you. Look, if it'll ease your conscience any, Major Dawson is en route to the island as we speak. He'll take care of the problem. - Dawson! - Oh, you know him. He's good; he's very good. - Yeah, I know him. Hell pull that island to hell if it suits him. - If it suits him, yeah. (soft knocking on door) Enter. - Sir, Major Dawson has arrived at ground zero. - Oh, good that's excellent news, thanks. Keep me posted, will ya? - Yes, I will, sir. - Look, what in the hell is your problem? Don't we both want this creature killed? - I wish I'd destroyed it myself. - Then why don't you relax, and let my men do their job. Look the more noise you make about this, the more chance there is it'll leak out, and you don't want that doctor because you could be facing prison. - Are you kidding? If I go down that pit, I will take you with me, so help me god. - Yeah, well, you can have faith in your god, if you want. As for me, I'll trust in the good old. United States Marine Corps. That's all. (soft trumpet music) - [Group] Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. - What are you guys doin' here? I said what are you doin' here? - There was an accident. We're shipwrecked. - Sir. Sir. - What the hell is goin' on, dude? - I don't know, man listen. - They'll seriously comprise this mission. You know that right? - I'm aware of that, Lieutenant. Call this in. We need five civilians picked up immediately. - Yes, sir. Red Eagle to base do you copy? (garbled radio static crackling) Red Eagle to base do you copy? (garbled radio static crackling) - We'll retrieve you all as soon as possible, and for whatever you do, stay close to the beach and do not wander off alone. - What's goin' on? - That's classified. - Man, that is not a good answer. - That's the only answer you gonna get from me son, so if I were you, I would stop askin'. - Sir. I'm afraid it's gonna be a bit longer. All I'm getting with that radio is a bunch of static. - We'll just take them to the lab with us. We'll use the radio there if it works. - What are you talking about? What lab? - Like I told your friends, just stop askin', and we'll get along just fine. (monster bellowing) (suspenseful music) Get down, get down, get down, get down. I said get your asses down! (monster screeching) (people screaming) (guns firing rapidly) - What was that? - Jesus! - What is that? - Dammit! - Dammit. - What the hell was that thing, man? - What the hell was that, and don't tell me it's classified! - You weren't supposed to be here. You weren't supposed to see that either. - Man, I'm sorry we rained on your parade, but what was that thing? - Back up. - Come on, man, it looked like it was gonna eat us! - That thing it could've killed us! - You see the size of that thing! Man, it was like 30 feet long! - Yeah, right try about 15, smart ass. - Well, I'm sorry I forget my tape measurer. (heavy groaning) - Get me out of here. - Everybody, just calm down. Calm down! - So, you're the man in charge. - That's right. I'm Major Dawson. This is Lieutenant Hastings. - I'm Jason. Ryan. That's Tori, Kaylee, and Lea. - Son, do you think you could handle this? - [Jason] Figure it out. - [Ryan] You sure? - Said I'll figure it out. (dramatic music) Where are we going? - There's a research laboratory just a few miles from the beach. You and your friends will be safe there until we finish our mission. - Oh, my god. - Tori, come on calm down. - Why did we stop? - Come on, man, what was that thing? I guess if he tells us, he's gonna have to kill us. (dramatic music) - Perimeter all clear, sir. - Sir, what is that creature doing on this island? - I haven't the faintest. - Major, please. There's a giant lizard flying around this island. It already tried to kill us once. What's stopping it from doing it again? - Us. We were sent here to do some serious body injury to this animal, and I aim to complete this mission. - You were just sent here to kill this thing. That's all you know about it. - That's all I know about it, and that's all you need to know about it. The lab's close. Let's go. (gentle music) Hastings, the plan. - [Jason] What's wrong? - Look, we need to rest. Look at the girls. - No. No, we stop that thing's gonna attack us. Look, I can keep going. We all can. (Tori sobbing) (Tori babbling erratically) - Maybe just a moment. - That thing's gonna kill us all. (dramatic music) (sobbing) That thing is gonna get us all. I'm gonna die. Die, I'm gonna die! No! (garbled radio static crackling) (birds chirping) (ominous music) - Sir. - Jason. - What's up. - We can't trust these guys, man. (garbled radio static crackling) - I mean, they're not even telling us anything. - Yeah, but we got no other choice. - We just gotta get out of here, you know. - Watch it he's coming back. (tense dramatic music) So much for spring break. - All clear, sir. - I can't get anyone. - What are we gonna do about these kids? - Just like I said they stay at the lab until we find and kill that son of a bitch. - Yeah, but, sir they're witnesses, compromise the mission. - Be right back. (tense music) - And I thought about that, too. - So, we're really gonna do it then? (suspenseful chord striking) - Mother! - Oh, my god. - Let him go! - Hey, hey. - I said let him go. - Lower your weapon, Lieutenant. - But, sir. - Now it's your turn. - Come on, Jason. - Why'd you do that to him, huh? (Ryan gasping) - Instinct, he snuck up on me. Not a good thing on his part. - Come on, baby, we just have to do what he says, all right. We have to stick together. (Ryan coughing) - Let's go. Let's go come on, let's go! Let's go! - Look, man, I want a gun. - You want a gun. - You want a. - Yeah. - Here you want a gun carry the bag. - Oh, yeah, right away, sir. I'll carry your bag. - No, I want a gun. - Carrying the bag, and then you get a gun. - Alright, give me the gun then. - Go head give it to him. - You heard the man. Yeah, do what the man said. - There's a gun. - That's what I'm talking about. - But believe me I'll be watching you. - Alright, I'll carry the bag. (dramatic music) Watching you, too. - Alright, guys, let's move out. Let's move out. (dramatic music) - [Stevens] Shouldn't they have reported in by now? - What do you know about Major Dawson, doctor? - All I need to know. I met him. I read his file. - Yeah, but that doesn't tell ya anything about the man. - As far as I can tell, he's been in the service since high school. Obviously, he didn't have too many other prospects. - Dawson earned the rank of captain by the time he was 25. Do you know what that means, doctor? He's an officer. We don't make people officers unless they've got a college education, but somehow Dawson bypassed all that. - Battlefield promotion, right? - Yeah, battlefield promotion, right. Listen to me! He defied coalition orders and took his recon unit into Iran. - Deified coalition orders, oh, yeah, that's commendable. - Yeah, it is. He deified orders to rescue crew and patients from a down Red Cross helicopter. By the time he and his men arrived there, the republican guard had shot the pilot in the kneecaps just for sport, and they were getting ready to rape one of the nurses. Well, Dawson and his men made sure they died for that. Each and every one of those Americans is alive today thanks to him. And you know what he got for his trouble? A bullet. - Yeah, well, that's all very heartwarming there, General. But you forget I've seen this guy in action. He is ruthless. - Yeah, that's another thing I like about him. - So, um what about Ann? Dr. Carr, I mean, do you think he'll find her? - If she's alive, yeah. Why all this sudden concern for Dr. Carr? Didn't you leave her there to die? (dramatic music) (birds chirping) - So how long you been a Marine? - What? - Man, I'm just trying to make some polite conversation. - Yeah, right, at a time like this, come on. - I guess, it's easy for you. You must not be scared of anything. (soft chuckling) - Yeah, right. This flying thing scares the hell out of me. - You didn't know what you were up against. - No, I just didn't ask the questions that's all. - You just assume they have your best interest at heart, I guess. - No. We're not a bunch of idiots just running around and take directions either, all right. We do think for ourselves. Plus, I don't need a lot experience to make a good decision. Alright but make sure you understand that Major Dawson makes all the big decisions. Alright, make sure you understand that. - Sounds like a great way to get your ass killed. (dramatic music) What are we stopping for? The research facility's right here. - Down. (birds chirping) (monster growling) (suspenseful music) Get down! (guns firing rapidly) - Let's see how well you fly with some led in your ass. Oh, you just gone fly up on us and try and sneak away. - Tori, come on get up, get up. Move, get up, Tori, get up. (suspenseful music) - Come on, move it. - I'm trying. - Faster, come on. (guns firing rapidly) (suspenseful music) - This is major. Major Dawson to General Morganstein come in. (Tori gasping) - We have to go. - [Jason] Let's go. (women screaming) - This is Major Dawson to General Morganstein come in. - [Hastings] Let's go come on, let's go. (monster growling) - Tori, what are you doing, get up! - Tori, no! (monster roaring) (loud screaming) No! (guns firing rapidly) - Tori get up! - Tori. Oh, my god, Tori! - Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Oh, my god. (soft sobbing) - It's okay. - Let's go, let's go, let's go! - Come on. - Tori. - Come on. - (soft sobbing) - Come on, come on, run. Let's go. - Come on. (dramatic music) - [Hastings] Let's go. - [Ryan] Come on, come on. (dramatic music) - Sir, I'm low on ammo. - Maybe there's more inside. - You know the code? (keypad beeping) Sir, I'm just gonna break it down. - [Dawson] Go for it. - Who the hell are you? What are you doing here? Did General Morganstein send you? - The question is who the hell are you? - I'm Dr. Ann Carr. - But Dr. Carr is dead. - Look, I have my ID in my lab coat. May I proceed to get it? - Slowly. (Lea sobbing) - Dr. Ann Carr. Please excuse the mess. But it's hard to get help around here. (soft sobbing) - Excuse me, ma'am. Is there someplace my friend can lie down? - Right over there. I figured I was presumed dead. Why did they send you back? - Clean up. You know we had to be sure because Dr. Stevens didn't know. - Stevens! - (scornful chuckling) Stevens he knew what we were creating. He left us here to die. - Wait a minute. You created that thing. - I'm sorry who are you? You're not military. - Nope. We're accidental tourists. We don't know exactly how we get here. - You know, who we are doesn't matter. That thing just killed a friend of ours. (heavy sobbing) - I'm sorry about your friend. So many have already died. - But it stops here. - General Morganstein send you? - That's correct. Lieutenant Hastings and myself were sent here to hunt this beast down and kill it. - Just the two of you. - We were supposed to paint the target. - Yeah, and our radio's dead, and with it, the mission unless you have a working radio. - If I had one, I would've called a cab a long time ago. - How is she? - She just passed out. I think the shock got to her, you know. - Sir, I'm gonna go look around. See if I can't find something to help us get us off this island. - Okay. (tense dramatic music) - Hey, what happened on this island? - Why don't I start from the beginning it may make a little more sense. Don't you agree, Major? Two years ago my colleague Dr. Stevens and myself were commissioned by the military to aid in creating biological weapons. We had barely established this lab when the true nature of our experiments was revealed to us. Knowing of our background in genetic biology, the man himself, General Morganstein sent down orders from the Pentagon detailing what was expected of us. That we were supposed to create biological weapons had been clear to us, but the general also wanted us to create biological mutants. Although we were funded by the military, the very nature of our top secret experiments meant we had very little to work with. It was my understanding that the president himself was unaware of the project. Our first experiment was both a success and a failure. We genetically cross branded a larva form an earthworm with an indigenous dung beetle. (low growling) (tense music) (loud screaming) - [Man] Somebody help, Ken! - Push! - I'm here man! - We got it, yank! (loud screaming) (suspenseful music) Doctor Stevens! The death of a colleague was a blow to us. But our experiments continued with even greater success. We successfully spliced together the DNA of a South American blood bat and an unidentified serpent found only on this island. We dubbed the creator Reptisaurus. I came to believe that we were making a very big mistake. Dr. Stevens. - Again. - Dr. Stevens. You and I need to speak now. - There was an egg here two days ago. Two days. What do you need? - We need to talk about this project. It needs to come to an end immediately. - Well, no, it doesn't. I'm a corporate man, Ann, bought and paid for, so are you. - Nobody buys me. Do you understand that? Nobody buys me. What you're doing here is immoral. Have you given it any thought? - Money buys a lot of morality, Ann. Have you thought about that? - You make me sick. The creature escaped, and it went on a rampage. It had grown faster than we had anticipated and had developed a blood lust. When Dr. Stevens and I returned from a field survey, we discovered the carnage that the Reptisaurus had left behind. (somber music) Dr. Peters? - No. That's Harvey. That's Peters. - Do you see? Do you see the monster we've created? - Well, he was a little hungry, yeah. I mean, both these guys seen better days. - You money-grubbing bastard. That's awful. - Ann. Ann. (heavy sighing) Sorry about this, Harvey old pal. Looks like you're not gonna get out of this one alive, you and your pal Peterson. I'm gettin' out alive even if it's by myself. - Dr. Stevens fled the island. The military came and destroyed everything. There's nothing left to prove that this experiment ever existed. - The results are still here. - Three months ago when it killed my colleagues, it took with it several soldiers. Everyone was killed except me. - How did you survive? - When the creature escaped, I hid in the sleeping quarters. Once it was outside, I locked the main door, and I stayed hidden. This place is very secure. - What about Dr. Stevens? - Dr. Stevens that coward. He radioed his beloved General Morganstein, who sent a rescue crew. - Well, did he know you were alive? - He didn't care. - You've been here all alone for three months. - Well, you guys created this thing, right? So, you must know someway to defeat it or its weaknesses or something. - It ran away before we had the time to run the proper tests. We know nothing about it besides its genetic makeup. - Oh, that's just great. Great. - So much was left incomplete. - There'll be no mistakes this time. I'll make sure of that. - [Ann] How could you be so sure of yourself? - Oh, let me guess. That's classified. - I am in control of this mission and everything involved. I'll perform a perimeter search, and when I return, you and I will hunt this beast down and kill it. - Sir, I don't think you should be goin' out there right now. - There's been no noise. I think it's gone back into hiding. - Sir. - Keep close to this door. I'll knock once when I finish my recon. That's an order. - Wait a minute you expect us to take orders from you. - You will if you want to live. (dramatic music) (garbled radio transmission crackling) Major Dawson to General Morganstein come in. - Status report. - I've located Dr. Carr. I repeat I've located Dr. Carr, sir. Also civilians on the ground. Civilians on the ground. One of 'em have been killed. One of 'em have been killed. - Civilians. - Yes, sir, civilians. - Alright look, Dawson. Civilians are entirely expendable as is Dr. Carr. The experiment is to be destroyed at all costs. Do you read me, over? - Copy that, sir. Over and out. - Civilians. (soft knocking on door) Enter. Dr. Carr is alive and on the island along with a handful of civilians. - Civilians? - Witnesses. - You're gonna have to rescue them, all of them. - Suddenly, you're worried about the survivors after you skulked off that island with your tail between your legs. (soft chuckling) - Alright, I get it. I left them there. Now you send an exaction team out. You get those people the hell off that island. - Or what? - Or I'll just have to run this by your superiors there, General. (tense music) - You don't really understand how I operate, do ya, huh? Those civilians are collateral damage, the price of war, the cost of doing business. - You're insane. - No, I'm careful, and I'm a team player. If that thing gets off that island and comes here, the team loses. - I don't care if I get a long prison term. I'm probably due. You're goin' down. - Listen to me, you pathetic little man. I'll do whatever it takes to protect this nation and the people in it. Majority rules if I have to sacrifice seven people for seven million, then so be it. I'm willing to make that sacrifice for them and even for you. - You're out of control. - Oh, really. You think you're the only genetic engineer who's susceptible to brides, doctor. Let me tell ya something. I can make you disappear, and I can find me another one just like you. - Not in this country. - Oh, really. Let me show you something. (tense music) Come here. - You're okay, too. Alright, let's not do something you're gonna regret. - Get down there. - Oh, come on, General. Don't pull that trigger, General. Don't you do it. - You know how many men I've killed, do ya, doc? Do you know how many men I've killed? - You're not gonna kill me too, General. Come on, don't pull that trigger. Don't you do it, General. (gun clicking) - You're afraid to die. That's the difference between you and me. Guards. Arrest this man. Take him to the brig. The charge is assault with a deadly weapon. Get him out of here. - [Guards] Yes, sir. - On your feet. - Let's go. - Dawson's out there all alone without reinforcements. I should've went with him. - Why? Come on, Jason, what would that serve? Don't be stupid. You're not like this. You don't act like that. You plan stuff out, right? - You're right, you're right, you're right. - Come on. - It's better that I'm here with you. - Yeah. I mean, if we just keep our heads about us and stick together, we're gonna get through it, right? - Right. - Yeah. - Okay, I'm gonna go check on Kaylee. - All right. - Okay. - Okay. - Hastings. - What? - Do you really trust Dawson? - Why are asking me that right now, man? - Look, man, I'm just tryin' to figure out what's going on here. - What are you tryin' to get it? - Look, man, there's something he's not telling you. - You better watch your mouth. - You gotta be kiddin' me if you don't think that he's not. - You better watch your mouth. - Come on, man, you know he's not telling you the full truth. - Did you not hear me? Shut up and go sit down. I'm not tellin' you again you understand me? (loud pounding on door) Go ahead sit your ass down. - Dawson walked in now, so if we go, I'm gonna help you, okay. It's gonna be all right. - Is it still out there? (tense dramatic music) - Did you kill it while I was gone? - No. - Then it's still out there. - [Lea] I'll be right back, okay. - How are you doin'? - I'm just a little shaken up. I'll be fine. - You know, we're gonna be okay. (soft music) Promise you. No matter what happens I'm gonna do everything I can to make sure you get home. - Dr. Carr, you said you didn't have time to properly assess this creature. - That's correct. We really don't know anything about it. - Is there anything you do know? - Look, I told all of you to stop askin' questions! - If there's something that she knows that can help us kill that thing, I sure as hell would like to know what that is. Is there anything in any of this stuff that can help. - The military destroyed everything. You won't find anything in this mess. - Look, I am more than capable of handling this situation. I suggest you back off. - You can handle this. Is that why Tori was ripped in half by that thing? Wow, you're doing a bang up job. - [Kaylee] Back off. (tense music) - Put that gun down. - You stay away from him. You stay away from all of us. - Kaylee, what are you doin'? - Kaylee, give me the gun please? - (sobbing) I just wanna go home. - Kaylee, just give Jason the gun, and we'll all get out of here together, okay. - No, the doctor said that there's no way to kill that thing. No, we have to run. We have to run we'll run to the beach, and we'll signal for help. - You'll never make it. That thing will kill you. - Shut up! We can hide behind the trees. It won't see us there. - Kaylee, you saw what that thing did to Tori. There's no way you can survive out there all by yourself. - But we have to run. Look I don't hear anything. Maybe it's gone. - Look, that thing will sniff you out and kill you. - Shut up! Shut up! I just can't stay here anymore. I just can't. - Kaylee. (heavy sobbing) Kaylee, stop! Come on Kaylee wait! Kaylee! - Hastings. - [Hastings] Sir. - Go get them and bring them back. - Yes, sir. (heavy sobbing) - Kaylee. Where you goin' come back, Kaylee. - Where you goin'? Where do you think you're goin' let's go. That thing is gonna kill you. (heavy sobbing) (monster growling) (suspenseful music) - Kaylee. No! No! (Kaylee screaming) No! No. No. Kaylee. (gun firing rapidly) (suspenseful music) No. No. Kaylee. No. (suspenseful music) Kaylee, no. No. Kaylee, oh, my god. (somber music) No, Kaylee. No, no. No, Kaylee. (heavy sobbing) Kaylee, no. No. (somber music) No, Kaylee. - Let's go come on. Come on let's go. Let's go we gotta get out of here let's go. Come on she's gone, man. Look, she's gone let's just go, let's go. You don't wanna be next. - No, Kaylee. - Let's go. - Come on get up. - Kaylee. - Get up. - Kaylee. - Get up. Come on, man, let's go she's gone. She's gone let's go. Come on. Come on. - Don't stop. - No, Kaylee. (heavy pounding on door) - Oh, my god? - Ryan. - Where's Kaylee? - Ryan. - Where's Kaylee? - What happened to Kaylee? - She's gone. - [Lea] What? What? (Ryan sobbing bitterly) - What! - Kaylee. It killed her. - I told ya she wouldn't make it. - You said... It should've been you! (suspenseful music) - Whoa guys, hey! - (people shouting loudly) Guys stop fighting! That's is not gonna solve it. - [Jason] I'm tryin' to help, Ryan! - Hold on! - Sit down! (people yelling loudly) - Get the hell off me, back off! - Stop doin' it now! - [Lea] Get off of him! - Get up! Get up! Get up! - Stop fighting now! - Stop it! - Stop it! - [Ann] You are grown men! (people shouting excitedly) - [Hastings] Stop, get up, break it up. - Break it up. - Get off of me! - Break it up! That's enough, stop! (suspenseful music) - [Dawson] Let it go. - No. - [Dawson] She's gone. - No, don't talk about her like that. - She's gone. - No. - [Dawson] And she's not coming back. It don't matter she's gone. She's gone. She's gone. It ain't nothing I can do. She's gone. - No. - She's gone. (gentle music) - Lucky for you I have a first-aid kit, huh? I'm sorry about your friend. I'm sorry about your friend. - Dawson, this is ridiculous, okay. We've lost two friends out there, and if we keep this up, we're not gonna have to worry about that thing. We're gonna finish each other off. - I'm sorry. You're right. You know, we need to work together in order to kill this thing. - Hold on a second. Finding that thing is not the problem. It's killing it that's gonna be the real issue. - Well, this won't do too much damage. - Why is that? - It's skin. It's mutated. Most serpents have naturally rough skin as to protect them from sharp rocks rigid services. So, if its skin is mutated and you try to kill it with bullets, it's not gonna happen. - Okay, if bullets won't work, maybe this will. - Now we're talkin'. - We need to find it. How we gonna catch it off guard? - I don't know. - Well, it's a serpent, and it's cold blooded. So, it's gonna look for warm places. - Yeah, but, I mean that could be anywhere on this island. - True, but it's also part bat and it favors dark places. - Caves. - Of course. There's a small section of the beach where there's a cave. That would be a good place to start. - Okay, that's what we'll do. Lieutenant Hastings and myself will head out after first light. Then maybe the element of surprise will give us an edge on this creature. - Hey, we can help you. - No. Too many have died. - That thing killed our friends. (gun cocking) I'm gonna see it dead. - You know what. I admire your courage. - Thank you. Sir. - You know what also I have to be honest with you all. At this present moment, the military has deemed you all expendable. None of you, none of you were supposed to be here. - We're not being rescued. The military only concern at this moment is the destruction of this creature. I have failed. None of you should have died on my watch, and for that I am sorry for your friends. You know we all need to get some rest at this moment. I think a good night's sleep would do us some good. - I agree. (dramatic music) (powerful dramatic music) - Yo, let's go boys and girls. Lock and load daylights on us. It's game time let's go. (dramatic music) - Shoot. You guys really come prepared. - Is there any other way? - Not with this thing that's for sure. - There you go, you good? - Think I can manage. - All right. Jason, you're up. - Well, done, gentlemen. - Got this especially for you. - Here you go, doc. - You get two. - Doc, you're gettin' two. - Oh, you don't have to ask me twice. - Well, be careful with those, too. - See, this is what I'm talkin' about. Whoa, man this is it. I can't get no grenades or nothin'. Come on, man, you know I owe this monster more payback than that. - What do you think? - You think you can handle mine? - Yeah, I can handle yours. - Let him have it. - Givin' him yours. - Payback time. - There you go. - Let me see this right here. See, now that's what I'm talkin' about. I am gonna blast Godzilla's ass. - What a clown. - Dr. Carr, you know where this cave is. You stay with me. Hastings, you and Ryan take the rear. Jason, you and Lea stay in the middle, and everybody all eyes on the sky. (dramatic music) (monster growling) - Doctor. - Yes, sir. - I need you take me to the cave where the beast is located. - Okay. - Hastings. I need you to take the kids back to the clearing, and I'll meet ya there, copy? - Yeah, yes, sir, got it. - Alright, let's go. - Let's go. - Guys, here we go, come on. Let's go. - Good luck. (suspenseful music) - Shh, no noise. - God, I can't believe I made this thing. How could I? How could I have not seen this? - Okay, doctor, where's is the cave? - It's right over there. - Okay. Okay, we're gonna go back and get Hastings. - Okay. - Then come back and kill this bastard. - Okay. - Okay. - Sounds good. - Alright, let's go. (monster growling) - Where the hell is it? - It sounds close. (monster roaring) - Come on. - Show yourself. (monster roaring) - It's over here. (suspenseful music) (guns firing rapidly) (loud groaning) - I'll help her. Come on, get up. Get up. (monster roaring) (Ann screaming loudly) (All screaming loudly) - Come on. - [Dawson] Back it up! Back it up! (monster roaring) (loud screaming) - Come on. - Come on get up. - Get her up. - You gotta get up. You gotta keep moving, come on. Stay down. - Damn. - Come on! - How you doin'? - (groaning) I have a broken rib. - Sit up. - And a broken arm. (guns firing rapidly) (loud screaming) - Are you alright? You good? Okay. (monster roaring) (suspenseful music) - [Hastings] Go get him. - Hey, bud, are you okay? - Do I look okay? - We have to put pressure on the wound, all right. - Come on! - No! (Ryan screaming loudly) - Come on, come on. Come on, come on. - No! No, Jason! No, Jason! Jason, no! (suspenseful music) (gentle music) - Look, I'm gonna be okay, man. Just go kill that thing already. - I gotcha. But you know what this ends now. This is Major Adam Dawson come in please. I repeat this is Major Adam Dawson come in. - [Operator] Major Dawson, we read you loud and clear. - Copy, I need three civilians picked up immediately. I repeat three civilians picked up immediately. - You had contact this entire time. This entire time. - As planned. - You bastard! - You bastard! - Stop it. It's too late now! - You bastard! - [Ryan] You're ass man. (dramatic music) - Doctor, you think he'll be okay? - He'll be fine. The cuts are deep, but he'll be fine. - [Lea] Here. - Here there's a rag. There's a rag. - You know what I can't. I just can't let you three go on. - Can you handle it by yourself? - You know what I'll take this mother out by myself. - [Ryan] It's about time. - Major Dawson wait! Major! - General, command is on the com. - I'm authorizing carrier Strike Force Independence to destroy the small island 200 miles north/northwest of their location. Authorization code is Alpha, Romeo, Bravo 4379. - Got it? - Sir. Carrier Strike Force Independence has received a request for extraction less than five minutes ago from Major Dawson. - Delay that order. My orders supersede all others. Is that clear?- Yes, sir. Authorize code received and confirmed, sir. - All right. (tense dramatic music) (plane engine roaring) - [Pilot] This is Strike Force Tango. Target coordinates are marked and locked in. Approaching target at Mach .5. (suspenseful music) (dramatic music) (gun firing rapidly) - Slow down, slow down. Wait, wait. (monster growling) - [Dawson] Let's go! Come on! (monster roaring) (suspenseful music) (somber music) (loud explosion) - He got it. He got it. - He got it. Did you hear that? Did you hear that? I think it's rescue, come on. - Help me up; help me up. - Let's go, come on. - Come on. - Get the message. This is Strike Force Tango we're approaching target. Request permission to fire? (airplane engine roaring) (dramatic music) - [Ann] Major Dawson. (Ryan mumbling excitedly) - [Lea] Major, - did you get it? - Did you kill it? Did you kill it! - Look at me. What do you think? - And help is coming. (airplane engines roaring) (suspenseful music) - This is Major Adam Dawson come in. - [Operator] Tango this is Independence. You're authorized to proceed. - [Pilot] Roger that Independence we're headed in. - We have three civilians who need pick up immediately. The threat has been eliminated. I repeat this is Major Adam Dawson. - [Operator] Strike Force Tango cease fire. We have friendlies on the ground. - [Pilot] Copy that we are disengaged. - How the hell could they have survived. (soft knocking on door) Enter. - General, the MPs are here with the doctor. - Have them bring 'em in. - [MP] Where would you like him, sir? - Oh, just sit him down in the chair there. - Sit your ass down. - Is everything alright, General? - Yeah, it's fine. That'll be all, dismissed. The creature has been destroyed. - You think you've won this one, but you haven't. - What are you talkin' about? - You'll need to send another team to the island. - Why? - 'Cause the life form we created was asexual. A creature that reproduces asexually it doesn't need another of its species to procreate. We created this thing to be able to reproduce on its own, a method of survival, if you will. (ominous music) You could call it a design flaw. - Are you trying to tell me (ominous music) that there are more of these creatures out there? (dramatic music) (soft cracking) (monster baby gurgling) (dramatic music) (powerful dramatic music) (dramatic music)
