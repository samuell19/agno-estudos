[chatter] [music playing] I can't-- believe me, I wouldn't do this for anybody else but you. Who can eat at this time of the morning anyway? Not even for my own mother. I appreciate it, Tony. You like my place thought, huh? The only good Italian restaurant in town. You know, you haven't been there in a long time, Hakim. See? We've redecorated, expanded. You're making more money. No, less, really. You know, the narcotics businesses is in the slump. Various factors. Competition. But I expect to make great deal of money soon. From numbers? It's the only convenient source, Hakim, how would I do otherwise? After all, we grew up together, went to the same school. But Chicago calls the shots for me now, you know that. I need the southwest side. Like I told you before, you can keep prostitution. Later on, I'll cut you in on the hard stuff. You just give me the numbers. Tony, I've told you before. I don't go that way. Drugs is your thing, you and Moma Lottie are into that. Numbers is my business, and I intend to be left alone to do it. Now that's all I can here to say. Why don't you understand that you're powerless? You're losing grip, Hakeem. You don't seem to understand that you just can't do anything you want anymore. You know I know every movie you make. Hey you don't pay people enough, or treat them right. Something. I've known your exact schedule for weeks now, that you worked out of the pool room on Main Street right this minute. I know who to get rid of to take care of that. I don't think you'll do know. Anyway, it doesn't make any difference. The contract is out on you, ole boy, and the order came through Chicago, not from me. Understand? I understand Tony. But call them and get them to give me 30 days to liquidate. The horse is out. I don't go that way. All right. But remember what I said. One of your people who works for me and I know everything you do. You play games with me and you'll be dead, Pasha. I told you, I understand. Step outside with me for a minute, there's something I want to say. He can hear anything I can. Tony. You first me relieved me of my gun. This is your turf, who could be more safe? Don't worry about it. She can use your friend for a minute. Anyway, who's afraid of a contract now? My, my, what a big girl we have here. I never had a chocolate milkshake before. Chocolate won't break you out. That's pretty. [laughter] What the hell's happened? I don't know. I'll speak to Serene. Damn, I forgot to pick up my gun from Tony's bodyguard. I took care of the bodyguard. Tony said there's a rat in our organization. You check it out, but I'll take care of it, OK? OK This is an election year Harvey. If I'm going to be elected mayor again in '56 for another term, I've got to have an issue that I can deal with now. The decent citizens in this community are getting sick and tired of all the killing and the crime in the streets. So, let's give them a target that they can focus their anger onto. John, let me put in a word. Really, this numbers thing does look like a good shot. And you got a ready made villain here, this Pasha person, you see? The police chief is on line four, Mr. Jabar. Good ole Harvey, dear love. The weakest of my enemies calls me. Drink it, drink it. Moma Lottie makes it especially for me from the real herb. Wait Nathan. You can't go in there, Mr. Jabar is busy. Nathan! Nathan, you can't go in-- It's all right, girl, it's all right. I had 369, and DuDitry told me you wasn't going to pay me off. You've seen DuDirty? He told you I wouldn't pay? I paid DuDirty for your hit yesterday. I always pay. Although it's not often somebody hits me for $7,000. Sit down. I don't want to sit, I want my money. DuDirty will be here in a few minutes to make his deadline. In the meantime, I'm going to sell you a house. Go on, sit down. You've got a little brother or son, Billy Jones? Yeah, my brother. I've seen him go into the Conwell's every day. He's a hip little cat. I think he's got some kind of a hustle going on already. What's your name? Nathan. Nathan Jones. Little Billy. He sure eats a lot of potato chips. [horn] [chatter] I'm in the chips, man, DuDirty's in the chips. Good afternoon, Pasha. Have you seen my new car? You remember Serene, don't you? Hi. And Nathan Jones, of course. DuDirty nigger! Listen man, listen! You didn't cut that women, nigger. That's old timer shit. I haven't got to that yet, but I'm still talking about trying to glop upside your head, nigger. But I got your money, man, I got your money! Well where is my money? Look, my number came in day before yesterday. Do I have to turn you upside down-- I got some of your money, I got some of your money. I'm going to kill you, child nigger. What good is his life when it's money you want? What are going to do for Nathan, DuDirty? I bought a car, and I got $3,000 left. You want the car? No. Well-- You're welcome to look at the wheels. Now give me the keys, DuDirty. Now where's my money? It's in the trunk man, it's in the trunk. Well, in a common, ordinary, brown paper sack. C'mon DuDirty, you're going for a ride. C'mon! Get in, get in! Not bad, huh? Yeah. Does he had a family or wife? Relative? A wife and two kids. I'll take care of him. OK? Girl, get a hold of Jimmy Rush for me. -Yes, sir. -Where's Serene? I don't know, she was just here a minute ago. Sneaky bitch. Listen Sweetman, I've got something for you to do. So, the police chief here may be right about the risks involved, and they're all out of tack. Now this is 1956, and you just can't count on what-- Chief Dearlove, who is Pasha, and what do you know about him? Edwin Austin is his real name. He calls himself Hakim Jabar. Everybody on the south and the west side know him as Pasha, or The Pasha. Now what the hell kind of name is that? It's a nigger name. Have you seen him? No. But you know where he is? Not precisely, no. But approximately, yes. How can be sure that even exists? How do you know the numbers exist? The whole policy lack it? These people are really clever about concealment, betting slips, and money. Hello, Mr. Conwell. Billy Jones. You're interested in chips boy? They look so good, you hold them so tight, I know they've just got to be good. You'll have to take my word for it. The amount of money generated in the betting game is enormous. Let me have my undercover man explain this numbers business to you. Wiley, would you step in here a minute please? Gentlemen, this is Officer Wiley. Officer Wile, explain to the gentlemen the numbers business please. All right, Major Delaney, councilman, our investigation shows that Mr. Pasha controls the numbers operation in this city. He has established pickup stations four his runners, and we have found out that he runs his operation very successfully. He controls pick up, pimps, houses of prostitutes, politicians-- [music playing] Hey, I want to talk to you. Whatcha doing? What? Hey man, what you doing? I'm headed in the barber shop. Soon as you get your piece over. You working for the man. Are you kidding yourself? I live here, man. My name's Sweetman, I've been here 30 years. I work for Pasha, son. Funny people Didn't I see you at the [inaudible] the other day? Yeah, you. And I nice little blonde under your wing. What are you fighting the man with? Pillowcases and sheets? Hey, Sweetman. You early today, ain't you? Pasha's running my black ass off. [laughter] How come the Pasha's got you hustling so hard? Trouble, Brother Winston. Trouble. You mean like in white folks middle name? Not many home folks that said aggravation. I heard some of them Italian businessmen been robbing the pick up men bad lately. Shit. That's nothing new. They've always been robbin'. A piece of known Italian if nothing else. Some jive cops that bug me. The man don't mess with you? Who? What's the matter with you, man? Ain't you registered to vote? This is an election year. Every four years downtown looks up and sees black. Taxes so high now, it doesn't pay to pay. Catch you later. 321, Ford. I'm going to catch you. You just can't keep your mind off the fancies, can you, Brother Winston? 321's going to screw into the ground. Let me play your number. Make your number in today, I know what it is, don't even tell me. You really do? You know I do. Hey, I gotta get by to see you sooner or later, but it's just a busy way. Don't leave, Sweetman. Hey baby, you know how it is. The number game is now. And I'll catch you later. I want to come by. We'll be there, my numbers. Billy, someday we'll move away from here. Far away from here. I want to be a football player and make lots of money, and buy a bit mansion. Billy, I'll probably take care of you all of your life. I'll be a millionaire before you get out of the sixth grade. I got this job with The Pasha. PASHA: Good evening, Willie. WILLIE: Good evening, Mr. Jabar. PASHA: How's that new baby of yours? WILLIE: Toya and her mother are both great. PASHA: That's good, take care of them. WILLIE: OK PASHA: Tell me, did you do what I told you to do? WILLIE: I said I did. PASHA: Everything? WILLIE: Everything. PASHA: Just in time, too. You know they blew my man James Turner away today, just when I was hassling with DuDirty over a hit. A big one? A youngblood named Nathan Jones is ready to eat DuDirty alive. I was ready to let him. But that was before I got the news about Turner. I figured I better cut down on inside friction, because we've going to need everybody we've got. Everybody. Nathan's going to be with us, too. Look here. Did he pay him? DuDirty paid him. But I want you to train him. How much time have I got? None. Just take him around with you. Is he good? Yeah, he's good. I've had my eye on him for quite a while now. Serene call you today? That bitch don't mean nothing but trouble. Anybody that loves blood that much. You oughta let me do whatever she's supposed to be taking care of. I don't make as much mess. Serene's a lovely number, will be fine for some time. But over the long haul, I want you right here, close to me, understand? You know, white girls would be just fine, if they had a little more behind. Just a different thing. Be careful with me, I love hips. With them, it's strictly what's up front that counts. Jimmy, I think I'd better go by silent partners and see before we go to the meeting. Tell Willie that I need to keep the motor running. As soon as I'm dressed, we'll go by Moma Lottie's. Good evening, Mr. Jabar. Good evening, Mr. [inaudible]. How are you this evening? Fine, yourself? Good, good. Did your son-in-law get his business straightened out? Yes, thanks to your help. That young lawyer of yours is a fine young mane. Yes, very intelligent. You told my wife, my daughter, and me, to hope for a suspended sentence, but he wanted that Jojo to quit it. And he said there'd be no more record. Very resourceful young man. He understands the white folks, that's what it is. He's been to their schools, he know how to speak their language. There's a rumor that you're going to sell this building back to the white. No, I don't take that. That all right? Babcakes has got McDonald's son-in-law acquitted today. The old man's elated because it's lighter on his pocketbook. Good evening. It is, now that I know that Jojo's out and OK. McDonald told you, huh? How could my son have married that old prune's daughter? I'll never understand. What's that I smell? You tell me first, you know what smell good? Don't look at me like that, honey. Before you'll know it, I'll be done stuck you and put you in the pot with the greens. Where's my man? Taking a bath, I guess. I heard the water running a while back. [humming] Hakim Jabar. Well, if I hadn't been married to you for the last five years, I guess I wouldn't recognize you. Where you been? Whatcha been doing? You haven't been doing nothing to me, that's for sure. You left out of here in your car Tuesday morning, and it's now 8 o'clock Wednesday night. You didn't even call. I could have been into anything in that time. Anything! Oh yeah? Now listen, baby. You just get into anything you want to. Absolutely anything that makes your little heart happy, OK? You must think I'm crazy. [music playing] Why don't you lay another helping of them chitlins on me, Mama? I was just going to do that. What time is it? 8:30. Let's go. Hey, who we got here? No thanks, honey. I'm just waiting for the pipe. Just the pipe. Hops is doing more good now than young girls. OK, Pops. But maybe some night when you're smoking your dope, you ought to let me-- Momma Lottie? Look up lightening for me and the three wise men. I want to play that number tomorrow. Don't let me forget, now. No, I won't. Aren't your afraid of being seen? Being seen? Come on, man I do what I do. Anyway, most of my friends and all of my notaries know that I come here. So why should I sneak around and try to hide my relationship with Momma Lottie? Besides, I want to go by unnoticed, I just make myself invisible. That's the most words I ever heard you put together, Jim. You old bat. Smoke some opium, raise your head. On you? Kiss my feet. Gee, baby. You came on me so quick. I really didn't know it was you. Come here. How much time we got? Enough. You look bad. I'm in trouble. Need some help from me? That's why I'm here. You won't let me love you anymore. You got anything to eat? I'm hungry. Hungry? You? What kind of trouble you got? I'll get to that. Will you give me something to eat? Raphael? Here. Raphael. He'll come cook you some hot stuff. Fiery stuff, make you struggle. You like that tea I make you? Let me tell you my other troubles first. I heard from Police Chief Harvery Dearlove the other day. One of my best customers, usually. But lately, he ain't been coming around as much. He's scared, Momma. That pig, afraid? Harvey's a wolf. Precisely a whole pack of them. But the one with the biggest mouth is Antonio Ferrero. Tony? You have got nothing to worry about. Number's not his business. He sells dope, heroin, you know. Anyway, we got an agreement, Tony and me for operating this little opiate concession. No take out, no delivery, strictly cash, and snort. He don't bother me. He's checked this resources and he knows that the money running through out hands is nice change. Half the population may take dope. But all of the population plays numbers. Sometimes. Tony's not is the only one that hates me for that. The damn mayor sheds a tear every time I drive by City Hall in a Cadillac. Niggers are supposed to be walking jack, or at least driving his own self. He's been waiting a long time for somebody to give them a reason and some help to nail my carcass. Maybe we better give it all up, at least until after this election. I thought of that. I've got friends down in Mexico. But you know me. Sitting around on my butt is not my thing. I've got to be right out there in the middle of it. Of course, later it should become necessary for me to leave the country. I want to depend upon you making all the arrangements. We'll move so fast, no one will be able to figure us out. I have a question. The police chief has been in our profits. So has the mayor, for four years. Now they want to get greedy. Why now? This is the question. I sure wish I knew what Tony's promised them. I think this is his office. I think the one supposed to be in the back. Where's the can? Here it is. Try the switch. Damn thing's dead. Use your light. All right. Let's move. [knocking] PROSTITUTE: Come in. Jimmy. C'mon, man, let's go. Cheeta, ain't you working tonight? PROSTITUTE: No, I'm not. This is the only place it can be. Must be a fake wall. Yeah, just as I thought, there's a room back there. Willie, drop me off somewhere close to the office. But not so that we'll be seen. What about in front of Baptist Church? Do it. Man, look what Charley's found. C'mon, there's an easier way. Aw, shit. You mean we did all this work for nothing? Where is everything? Very simple. The mayor wants to get reelected, right? The only way he can is to give the people a scapegoat, right? The Chief's the only one that can organize a raid. So we pull a couple of phony raids. I guarantee, within the next two weeks, we'll arrest somebody, but it ain't going to be The Pasha. You run on inside, give some of the guys help. Stay in the car, Willie. After it's unloaded, turn around and get ready to split, OK? Whatever it is going on over there, it ain't robbery. Ed, those guys could be up to anything. That's right. And if you're out here busting your balls trying to make police sergeant, just remember one thing. You don't see no police sergeant out wandering around in no dark alleys in no nigger neighborhood trying to find out what's going on. And it don't matter what. What we carrying, Pasha's wife? He's got you doing all the work. Whatever it is, it's heavy. Damn. What'd you do man, break a nail? No, I laid a egg. Hey, I ain't going out there again. Is there anymore? That's it, we got it all. It's about time. What you mean, our operation? Listen, Brother Jabar. You had a good thing going here. Small time business for some people, but good enough to keep you in a Cadillac, fine wines, and drinking cutty, and nice women, too. But don't be trying to put our Chevy drivers out in the street for you when your ass is on the firing line. This ain't no we shit. This is you. Man, don't you know the white folks are trying to get rid of you? They want to take over the number business themselves, it's as simple as that. And I'm ready to do business with them. Don't make no difference to me who the banker is. I ain't got but a nickel invested no how. A nickel of something is better than a nickel of nothing. Dad blame it, that's why my shorts are so high. That cop's investigating. You remember that when you have you first disagreement with Tony. Jesus Christ. What are you wearing that big mamalama for? Well, when I call this meeting, I figured I might have to kill me a couple of niggers to keep everybody in line. It's better if everybody's more afraid of me than they are the man. My name ain't Jesus. The name don't have to be-- Was your name Jesus when he got you out of jail 50,000 times? That don't make no difference. That makes a lot of difference. I ain't dying for nobody. Don't punk out man. It's time to stick together now. Let me tell you something. When the going gets tough, Pasha's going to pay for the baby's shoes. Pasha? Raphael? Where you staying at? Good to see you. They raided your real estate place, but I see you got away balls clean. You got to give Jimmy Rush credit for that. He'll probably have that big bodyguard with him. He's a tough customer. Don't worry. I'll give them both barrels at once. We'll be gone before that bodyguard gets up off the ground. If you miss, it's you life. How can I miss? Pasha. What are we going to do with your equipment? We can't run the operation from here. Not now. We just can't do it. What's in the box? Yeah, yeah, I'm sorry. I forgot about the boxes. It's not my equipment. It's mainly guns and ammunition. All kinds of weapons. Jesus Christ. Small guns, handguns. Pasha, what are we going to do with all of these things? You make your own decisions about that. I brought these things here for you. Do what you want to do. We've been talking all night about how we're going to protect ourselves. I expect you top piss or get off the pot. If you want to throw them out in the garbage cans, go right ahead. But I'd advise you to distribute, or get rid of them as quickly as possible. Because you may be raided as early as tomorrow morning. Then again, maybe not. Niggers. I love niggers. But they make me tired. Well, I don't like all this talk about war either. Most of our people ain't killers. Conwell with a gun? Besides, we don't have to go to war. We can outrun them. You said you're sure there's a contract down on you? Well I do know what I'm doing, Pasha. They'll have to get by me to get to you. Your loyalty overwhelms me, man. I'm going home. Catch you later. How long you think that nigger's going to be? Well, don't worry. I don't think he's in any hurry to get it. There he is. Hey Mrs. Jones, give me a dime for a cup of coffee. Don't bug me this morning, Peewee, I ain't got not dime. I know you made some money. You don't drink no coffee, no how. Hey baby, you were clean last night, down to your natural toes. You know how I go, trying to make it, trying to make it. Where did you get that fine red bone, baby? She gave it to me. How'd she get by me? You've been x'd. Next, man. For a second I see you still stuck with that 219 babe. I hope for god's sake, because you're killing me. Hey man. Hey, brother, what it is? You played a number last week, and they didn't pay. Now you want to play in my book, right? I like playing. OK, what's your number, man? 123. I tried to get your order last week at the jive. But I had it. Cool. You owe me a dollar and a half come Saturday. I'll pay you. And stop jiving. All right. Everything cool. Mr. Sweetman? Hey, Mr. Sweetman! Mr. Sweetman! Wow, hey, my man, what's happening? You coming to get some money today, Mr. Sweetman? No, you're rap's too weak. You got them in yesterday? Listen here Little Billy, stop spending all your time on the corner, will you? Go on home, your mom might be looking for you. Mr. Sweetman give me a quarter. That's a quarter? Sure is, let's go buy some potato chips. Pasha, I only called to give you bad news today. Go ahead. I'm going to raid you a few times, raid some of your places, that is. It's the mayor. Election time again, you know. So I'm going to play lamb for the wolves again, huh? Well if I can't make a good enough show for him, he's talking about putting together a special squad of handpicked officers and calling a distress, responsible only to him. They'll pick up where we leave off. So what does that leave for me? I'm sorry, Pasha, but he's giving me a deadline. Now if you'll just give me two or three arrests, maybe the whole thing will blow over. Do what you have to do. Y'all know you're going to get busted in a few minutes. Jesus Christ! I'm going to need some help. Everybody out the back way now, and take something with you. Don't be trying to put me in it. I'm just shooting a game of pool. If I wanted to work, I'd be on my job, at least those folks pay me. OK, Come on guys, let's get out of here. Just one way out, fellas. Haul ass and stay free. Pick up something and take it all out with you. Jimmy, [inaudible]. You take the car and Serene. I'll take Joe's car. Three, Jeremy 12. Three Jeremy 12. Three Jeremy 12, go. [sirens] Three Jeremy, 12. We've lost them. He went around a building down by the tracks and just disappeared. Where are they? They stepped out for a minute. Fuck you, gorilla. Don't play stupid with me. I asked you a question. Where are they? Like I said before, the proprietors stepped out for a minute, and he left me here to take care of things. I don't know nothing about any gambling. Why you! You can run nigger, but you can't hide! You've got to spring him before they have a chance to kill him. Pasha. When are you going to get some respect for my thing? This thing, the law? It's what you pay me for. I'm telling you, I can get him out of jail, they're not going to kill him. They wouldn't do that anyway. This is 1956. Just get Jimmy Rush our of the can, Sam. And don't give it an hour. Sam Kingston to see Mr. Common. Yes sir. Is he expecting you? Go right in. I have some papers for you to see. Sam Kingston, you're the attorney? Yes, I am. Just a minute. James Alfonzo Rush? Do you know when the operation is? Pasha said we need to call Conway, if that answers your question. I just had a couple of your daddy's old nasty coffee. Honey, get me a little thing of that [inaudible] there. This what you wanted, Ms. Green? That's it. What's you dream last night, Mattie? Oh, don't ask me. Don't ask me. That's getting into my private business. Ever since my old husband died, lord, lord. Seem like I don't dream about nothing but some young men. Well you must play this same number every day then. It come out yet? No. But when it do, I'm going to stop dreaming, and get myself a young, strong man. And give him anything he want. She ain't got a natural hair on her head. I know it for a fact. She ain't going to sit in the church with that. Can't you hear that phone ringing? You don't want to go to school, the least you can do is help out around here. Lazy heifer. Conwell's. Following Nathan Jones? OK. Are you following me, Little Billy? Shut up, Nathan. Mama sent me to the store. Nathan Jones, you've got to get rid of your pick up. There are lookouts that said the cops are following you. Give me a bag, a big bag. Grab some groceries, Little Billy. Tell Mama I'll be home later to take her to work. OK. Try not to panic, Sweetman. I'm here through all troubles. They stand up to here on my, you know. But out number's not up yet. Not by a long shot. True my man has been able to make a few bucks. What are you going to do, Pasha? [inaudible] Listen, Sweetman. I don't tell everybody my business. But I want you to understand, bail ain't that high yet. See, you district's not the only one with my back. Regardless of the hassle, the man ain't arrested nobody who had picked up any money. A few slips, yeah. A little change, yeah. But no money. You see, $100,000 runs through my steel safe each and every day. Tony had made a fuck up, not withstanding. Well, that's a lot of [inaudible]. Understand? So we've got to move again. We've got to move, that's all. But we're running out of places, except on this side of town. With election so close, they're ready to do a door to door search. Tell them we'll just have to say out of folks' houses. Where's your car? Down the street. But the cops know it. So it's Tony's boys. There's another one from someplace, and meet me in front of Axel's church in an hour. Reverend Axel's? Hey, he's a fool, but-- Gentleman, I'm going to have to cut out on you now. Who the devil can that be? Who knows you're here? My wife. Your wife? Oh come on, I guess you left the door open for her, too. Who you calling a fool? Shut up a minute. That couldn't have been her. [inaudible] I thought that's what that sounded like. Axel. Axel! I hear you in there wrestling with temptation. Any other time, I wouldn't trouble you. But believe me, I've got some very important business to discuss with you. That's The Pasha. Woman, you crazy? Open that door. Wait a minute. I didn't know you were a religious woman, Pearl. But I'm glad to see you've taken the right path. Reverend. I'm here on a very important mission. Why to me? Because you're a man of God. Now is my hour of need. You don't have to look so funny at me, Pasha. You know every man has some weaknesses. Exactly. That's what I came here to talk to you about. Those people in the community whose weakness is playing numbers. Pearl, your closeness to the preacher doesn't entitle you to hear our conversation. What? Go down to the basement and get dressed in the women's bathroom. Reverend Axel. How do you spend your days? What it is, baby? 321. How much? Both over 25. All right, who do I see? Who do I see for this money? [inaudible] Look here, man, how about my money. Same thing. You've been good. No, but I-- no, I want my money. Just do it, bro. Is that, Ray. Man, I want-- -All right, Ray. -Listen. -We both have to get out. -Would you listen to me? I want-- You won't get your money, no matter what. -The what you're talking about. -You get no money. -I want my money. -You getting it. I want it. -We're gonna split it. -I want it. -We're gonna get our money. -Listen to me. I want my money. You hear me? OK. You got it, bro. -I'm gonna get it. -You got it. You got it. You got it. [screaming] Little Billy, someday we'll move away. Far away from here. Billy, I'll probably take care of you all your life. Get up Nathan, get up Nathan. Get up! Don't cry, Billy. Don't cry. Everything is going to be all right, Billy. Hey, hey, this is what it's all about, take any part of it. Take it all. In the evenings, though, is mainly when it's busy around here. And most mornings, the church's just is just standing empty. That's right. Sweetman, what are you doing here? Hey, where's Pasha. He's in the back there with the pastor. -Thanks. -Hey, Sweetman-- Later, baby. Well, what's going on? Later. I didn't come here to explain my system to you. I'm just came here to tell you I'll use the church. Pasha. Sweetman. You're early. Couldn't wait, Pasha. Couldn't wait. What's this? Nathan. They got the kid Nathan. Tony, that son of a bitch. I thought he'd try to get me. You gone? He hides. Where'd they leave Nathan? Home. Who found him? His mother? For Christ's sake, man, speak up! Who found him? His-- his brother. Little Billy. The two dudes who did it have been located. Moma Lottie's got the stuff made up that I want to use on them. All you've got to do, Serene, is get to them, and enjoy yourself. Say, babygirl, what's taking you so long in there? You first. All right. Hello, Cappy. I want to see Tony. Tell him-- Tell him I've come to make a deal with him. Who is it? Pasha. Alone? Yes. Send that nigger on in here. What is it you want? To keep our business between us. That's the way I wanted it from the beginning. I was too arrogant. That's always been my only fault. Can you dig it? Let me fix you a drink, what do you have? Scotch on the rocks. Good. You look terrible. Too bad about that kid. I warned you. I hoping he wasn't one of your boys. Seems like you've been producing kids ever since you was one yourself. You and me came up together, just like that. I always loved broads. Tall, short, fat, skinny, white, black. Sweet flesh. I still do Hakim, how about you? What are we going to do to settle this mess anyway? The Chicago bosses are tired of waiting, I'm tired, you're tired, what's the solution? I thought perhaps you might have some ideas. You Italians were always better at that kind of thinking than us old colored folks. You're too much. You know, if you knew what I was thinking right now, I've hated you for a long, long time, Hakim. And right now, at this moment, I've got you right here in my hand. I could kill you, you know that. But I want to see you do it yourself. I want to see you make a slip somewhere bad. Just want to catch you with shit on your face. Your only chance is going to be right here and now, Tony. I still got your gun, Hakim. Yeah, the one you got from me in your restaurant. You've always been a man of honor, Hakim. Something I never could stand in a nigger. Now I want to see that honor put you right in your grave. Are you willing to pay the price to see me in mine? Man, oh man. There's a game. It's not Italian, it's Russian. It's a kind of roulette, a special roulette, where you play with life. You see? You drop a bullet in the barrel like that. Then you revolve it. You put it to your head, and press. You do it, Hakim. You do it. Just in case you think I tricked you. You take the first turn. Put the gun to you head and pull the trigger, if you can. You remember when we were kids? It was always you that wasn't afraid, and I always panicked. God almighty, how you used to torture me. Do it, damn it! Do it! You're a creep, Tony. You never have known how to play fair. What difference does it make? A little less noise and your gimp leg goon will be in here a hand grenade or something? No, no, this place is completely soundproof. Nobody will come unless I call them, and I won't, I swear. I'm going straight down to the wire. Luck is with me tonight, you ugly son of a bitch. It's got to be. It ain't worth it unless I can whip you just once. But you're afraid to give me the satisfaction, aren't you? You're afraid to put that gun up to your head. Take it. Niggers always want to go to heaven, but they don't want to die. If you weren't so arrogant, it couldn't been OK. But you had to have the biggest gun going. Now somebody's brains are going to spill all over my carpet. You're right, I never have played fair. I had the pin file down, I didn't want your stinking blood spilled all over my good self anyway. I just wanted to see you sweat. Now that the ceremonies are all done, both our ancestors will be satisfied. Pasha! Pasha. Sit down, shut up and get out. Hakim. Hakim? What happened? How'd you get here? Anybody follow you? Nobody followed me. I hear music. Well, you said you wanted a party tonight. You got one. Yeah, we can celebrate now. I did Tony in tonight, and his bodyguards kept him. Oh well, you can't stay here then. You'll get Momma Lottie in bit trouble. My business is all straight. I'll be gone before morning. There's a whole new change of clothes for you upstairs. You stay here, I'll go get them for you. By the way, Serene is the room down the hall. OK. Hey, are we going to hit Pasha? Nah. The contract will take care of that. All we got to worry about is that Serene. That flashy broad ain't going be hard to spot. Come in. It's getting hot. I think we better cool it for awhile. I know how to contact you if I need you. Here's your best. It's all in small bills. Thanks, hun. Take care of yourself. Did you get Romaine and the kids squared away? They're halfway to Mexico City by now, stop worrying. Raphael's brother will fly us out before dawn. I got the tickets. Willie, take care of the Cadillac? The Cadillac can do a lot of things, but it sure can't swim. Can I put that baby on the bottom of the river? Chief Dearlove will spend a lot of time working out that problem. Do you want to smoke a pipe? It's not opium. It won't make you nod, it'll make you see clearly. What is it? It's not reefer. It's special-- a special plant that come out of the ground around my old home place. That's suppose to make me strong too? It'll make you remember who you are. Let's try it then. We've been here three hours, wonder when that broad's going to show? Here comes somebody now. That ain't Serene. Tony said get Serene. So we wait until she shows. Cool it, he's coming over. How about a light for a cigar, buddy? [laughter] I know who the rat is, and I'm having him taken care of. MAN [OVER PHONE]: Hello Is Tony there? MAN [OVER PHONE]: That you, Sweetman? Yeah. MAN [OVER PHONE]: Lay low. Pasha's onto you. He got Tony and Cappy tonight. My name's Sweetman, I've been here 30 years. What are you fighting the man with? Pillowcases and sheets? Remember what I said, one of your people works for me. I know who to take care of to get rid of that. I don't think you do. Hello, Mr. Sweetman. One of those main runners is Sweetman. Sweetman, Sweetman. [laughter] Tony's not the one I want you to kill. There's some things that Pasha must do for himself. I know who the rat is. You don't know where the operation is? [laughter] [gunshots] Good bye, Mr. Sweetman.
