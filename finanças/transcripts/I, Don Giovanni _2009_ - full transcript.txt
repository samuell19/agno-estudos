Oh, my God! Don Giovanni! ME, DON GIOVANNI Do you want to take the name of Annamaria Conegliano? Yes, I want. I baptize you in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit Amen This show disgusts me. Poor Jews are forced to accept a religion that does not belong with them only for a widower to marry a Christian girl. Do you want to take the name of Emanuel Conegliano? Do you want to take the name of Emanuel Conegliano? Mr Casanova Have you gone mad? Why? Do not be scandalized, for God's sake! Emanuele Conegliano, you want to join the faith in Christ our Lord? It's Beatrice Beatrice was the muse, Dante's great love the poet of The Divine Comedy - I think one of the most sublime works ever conceived by the human mind Yes, son. A true masterpiece. If you come back to the altar you can visit my library anytime, and you can read this book, this beautiful book. Do you want to take the name of Lorenzo da Ponte? Say "yes", if you want it. Yes, I want it. I'll give you my name. Do you realize what a gift that means? Your name will be Lorenzo da Ponte, as it is mine. This name will open the doors of Venice and I'll help you succeed within the church and maybe one day, Lorenzo da Ponte, you can reach highest level. Words of Satan! Traitor! Infamous! Infamous! God punishes you! Stop this shit, infamous! Leave him alone! Damn! May God curse you! This man deserves no indignant mortification What you have done! Have you told my name? Follow me You have blood on your hands, Lorenzo da Ponte Especially in these days when the thugs of Barbarigo are on alert in all of Venice You shouldn't have lost your temper and react that way among the people. That poor man was punished because of me. He was punished for printing your verses and selling them at a higher price. It may be idealistic to love taking risks. I understand it well, but that's not enough, Lorenzo. You must know to avoid the danger when it endangers your own life. You can be impetuous and passionate, but not stupid! That printer could have cost you your life. "But tell me: at the time of tender sighs, whereby and how did Love concede to you that ye should know each other?s veiled desires? And she to me: There is no greater pain than to remember happy days in days of misery; and this thy Leader knows." Father... Can love... .. Transcend the barriers of spirituality? Are you referring to physical love? Carnal? He molests me, father. - Who? He bothers me. He pursues me. He takes me to bed. Are you talking about, perhaps, your adoptive father? Your uncle Barbarigo, which so successfully directs the Holy Inquisition... He's not your father's flesh, Francesca, but you are his adopted daughter... .. You are free to choose your lover You are a woman in the prime of life Beautiful... I love you! I'm thinking only of you, Lorenzo. I love you I don't sleep, I'm only thinking of you! And I want you, Francesca, I desire you, my love. Excellence, good morning ...at the time of tender sighs, Francesca... Your excelency, Father Barbarigo... - What were you reading so interesting? - the fifth Canto of Dante's Hell where the poet describes the penalties of hell reserved for the lustful ones I came to understand that this torment was for those condemned for the sins of the flesh, Who gave up reason and restraint for their lustful hunger. Sorry to interrupt your lesson, my dear Lorenzo, but I must speak with you at once. For weeks, I have tried to find that blasphemer who is accusing the Holy Inquisition of obfuscating the minds and being the cause of the ruin of Venice A modest poet, writing satirical verses quoting the blasphemous ideas of Voltaire, Rousseau and the French "Illuminati"(Enlightened) "Illuminist", your lordship Enlightened by the devil! And surely inspired by the ideas of that blasphemous Giacomo Casanova Your friend A sinner who will be sorry soon, God willing Well, we've finally laid hands... .. on one of those who distribute these verses in Venice a clandestine typographer who has revealed that the man whom we seek belongs to the Masons and could be a priest. A Mason priest? The enemy in our own ranks? It was hard to convince that unfortunate to confess... My God Lorenzo,please. I am very interested in the show. What an unworthy end for a character of the greatness of Don Giovanni! Come on, Maestro Giacomo, don't be angry! That libertine was so great? You're asking! Don Giovanni represents the only authentic virtue the freedom to enjoy our nature free from the bondage of morality and feelings Don Giovanni says 'To enjoy one moment of earthly life is worth eternity' Twenty two. Love, Cupid. Even number. Red, inside. Damn. Father, I need more coins. Damn bad luck, we're broke. If you allow me, beautiful lady, I will be pleased to help you The lady is with me To reject the money of a gentleman is not worthy of a lady but of a peasant. Lorenzo, why don't you relax in the "room of sighs"? Sir... Sir. Help me. I haven't enough money. I would like to help you but unfortunately I had bad luck, too. Brother. Here. Take this. Thanks brother. I promise you that we will divide the earning. San Gregorio, 12- I have your half. But this must be at least 50 ducats. The money comes, goes It does not give life, but it helps us to bear it. But I haven't call you here for this reason. Listen to me. Come with me. Look. I am an old man, tired and sick. I won't live long and I give up this world leaving nothing that can dignify a life spent between game tables and pawnshops with one exception It is my only daughter His mother died in childbirth she is what I love most in life. - Beatrice? - Not Beatrice. No. Annetta. Annetta Annetta Swear to me to care for and protect her forever after my death I swear I can not... I'm not worthy your trust. Stop! Lorenzo da Ponte! You are arrested in the name of the Holy Inquisition The court of the Inquisition judged you guilty. You have conspired against the church and against the state Having broken the holy promise to observe the rules, sworn by you, on behalf of Our Lord Jesus Christ For libertinage, prohibited affiliation to a Masonic society, profanity Sacrilege and public concubinage, and to provide an example and warning to all people we condemn you... .. and we sentence you to 15 years of exile and separation from the "Serenissima" Republic of Venice Fifteen years of exile? Magnificent! You had luck! Come on, be brave! A sip for each year. Lorenzo! With your talent it won'be difficult for you to find work in Vienna, which moreover it is also a beautiful city with people open to new ideas. We are respected there, Lorenzo. It is a letter for Antonio Salieri, master composer at the court of Emperor. He will help you. You only have to present yourself to him with my warmest recommendations You can't imagine how grateful I am, master. During all these years, your wise teachings have guided me and now I can't repay your goodness for saving my life. Oh God! Oh My God! Look, look! Stop! Don Giovanni This Don Giovanni was doomed as it deserved for having abused a character worthy of further consideration. Well, sir? Pardon me, I didn't want to bother you.. Let me introduce myself. My name is Lorenzo da Ponte Delighted to meet you, brother Lorenzo. My name is Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart It is strange that you are complete unknown for me. I thought I knew all the brothers. In fact, I just arrived in Vienna. I was prepared to go to the Court theatre, when I heard your music. Court theatre? Are you perhaps a musician? No. I am not. I am a writer and poet. But I seek a compatriot, Antonio Salieri. He is a great musician. Yes. The great Antonio Salieri. The big Italian family I congratulate you, you're in good hands. Salieri is a fortunate man and he is supported by powerful people. Brother Lorenzo, welcome to Vienna and good luck! This... is trully a rudeness! And you, maestro Salieri - how can you allow such rudeness without intervening? I beg you, Madam Cavalieri, there's no reason to get angry! Right. A brief break for all This is trully a rudeness! So this is the welcome for an artist in Vienna Is this how you celebrate the "bel canto"? Love, listen I don't want to listen anything! You wanted to humiliate me by inviting that brazen one in your opera! Maestro Salieri. My name is Lorenzo da Ponte, I just came to Vienna I wanted to ask you... No matter your problem is, I beg you to wait me outside. Now I can not listen to you very well. I am sent by Giacomo Casanova Forgive me if I maybe seemed unkind, but today is not a peaceful day... Majesty! Your visit honors us greatly The honor is mine. As you know I am passionate about your work although it appears that I arrived at a bad time You told me the rehearsals start today God knows... His Excellency the Count, in fact, is right only that, you just arrived during a brief break And I'll immediately resume the rehearsal; Please don't worry, I can wait Anyway, here there are many things to admire! And how is the situation with the second grace, the Lady Ferrarese? Your idea of bringing Lady Cavalieri and Lady Ferrarese together in my new opera seems to be an excellent idea, rather, I would say, even wonderful! Your Majesty, permit me to introduce to you Padre Lorenzo da Ponte a most dear friend and talented poet. Just arrived from Venice Majesty, I am delighted to find myself in the presence of the wisest and most enlightened monarch of Europe. In Venice, where I come from, you are respected and admired. - So you're a poet? - Yes, majesty As well as priest, libertine and troublemaker An exaggerated reputation which doesn't suit me, majesty Mr. da Ponte, exiled from Venice is seeking employment Your Majesty may perhaps... do something for him Of course Vienna needs now more than ever, poets, of fresh and reforming ideas, especially in the opera Maestro Salieri, what do you say if we entrust our friend da Ponte with the libretto of your next opera? Forgive me, Majesty - I fear I may not live up to such a task I have never written an opera libretto I don't think it's a serious obstacle if you lack experience in the field of opera. On the contrary, we need new talents, new ideas, to renew our opera also because my ideas please the Maestro Salieri It means we'll have a virgin muse Majesty, let me remind you that Maestro Salieri is already committed with the poet... Oh yes, Casti, Casti, I had forgotten Well, that can be resolved. Is there another composer here in Vienna with whom you would like to collaborate? Why not Mozart? Our little rebel from Salzburg. That's a wonderful idea It's been a long time that Mr Mozart wants to compose an italian opera! So be it! Your friend Lorenzo provides you always with the worst texts On the contrary, he reserves the best for Mozart and that Ferrarese whore! Forgive me my friend, I didn't hear you arrived I'm glad you decided not to undertake the journey alone Let me introduce you to a dear friend... Madam... Adriana Ferrarese, the incomparable soprano I was delighted to first hear you sing "The Marriage of Figaro" in Prague but now that I see you up close I must say that the rest of your person fully honors a voice so magnificent. And I see that the stories I have heard about you, weren't exaggerated. Oh, poor me. These are not stories but The Story At my age, I have found the peace of the senses and the duty of the spirit is to manage the memories with love, memories that these senses bring to it. His Excellency the Duke of Dux has entrusted to me the care of his magnificent library and now I live immersed in dreams and desires that lie between... .. wild adventures, secrets and impossible loves Books are my only comfort Ah, we all have a book that can move us, haven't we, Lorenzo? This one was expecting you. No, this IS for you. It looks like the book I saw the day of my baptism Not only seems, it IS the same book. When you left Venice, I found it in a bookshop and I thought "I'll buy it and give it to Lorenzo" Annetta When you left, you were anything but rich and now... you are one of the most acclaimed European lyric writers Thanks to your recommendation to Salieri He has helped me to break into the world of music Forget Salieri! No, he is an excellent musician but... his obligations in court are a major constraint. You must work again with Mozart, he is a very talented artist Your Figaro... delicious, light, full of imagination In the future, this is the way you must go. That's exactly what I tell him. After the triumph of Figaro, Lorenzo must work again with Mozart And why not? With me. You must know he has declined my voice, because Salieri who is a villain, imposed his own mistress, La Cavalieri. The only thing she does perfectly is... well, you can imagine Salieri is no villain, La Cavalieri is not a prostitute and I am not married to Mozart. The truth is that Mozart has very particular tastes and rejects all operas suggested to him. Ask me and I will write a story worthy of your talent What story? A new Don Giovanni. Wolfgang, stand up. Two guests are waiting for you. Who are they? Da Ponte and Salieri No, tell them to go away, I'm not interested. They want you to write a new opera, look, they have paid us a great advance You can't play hard to get and then expect worthwhile payment Let me remind you that we don't have money to pay the maid, that neither of us enjoys good health I must take expensive medical cure baths in Switzerland. Enough of your scolding! Always telling me what to do I have had enough of recriminations! Stanzi, sorry You know that there is nothing in the world that interests me like you do Let's see what these two scheming Italians want to tell me. Master.. My dearest My God, you are freezed! Master Salieri. Master Mozart. I visit you, by order of His Majesty to announce that you are commissioned to compose a new opera in Italian, obviously and assisted by the poetic talent of our friend da Ponte. As you know, the Emperor has been very pleased with "The Marriage of Figaro". We will do everything possible to satisfy His Majesty again. So let me advise you to avoid the scandals because the rough subject you will deal with. What's it about? All in due time, Maestro While performing an opera, it is necessary to ensure a proper education, as in a banquet we must instill a bit of sweetness into everyday travails of the public Therefore, my dear fellow, if I may advise you: write simple, light, easy listening music, so that the fine palates can digest and taste the show Sweetness, banquet, tasting, digesting Well, if I have understood correctly, Maestro Salieri for you to compose an opera is like making a good desert Let's see The heartaches and the eggs Some intrigue, the flour and for the comic relief, the sugar Then into this great dough Maestro da Ponte throws verses.. and I insert the notes, everything is baked and the wonderful dessert is ready, right? Misters, please forgive me. I have some other appointments. Good work! You have been too hard on him Salieri is more sensible than he looks Can you tell me which is the dubious matter of which Maestro Salieri was speaking? This opera will shake and astonish much more than "The Marriage of Figaro" That is? Don Giovanni! Don Giovanni... But if it has already been done dozens of times Never as we will do it. We will make a Don Giovanni no one will ever forget You know well that in every note I write, there is a part of me Something I feel, something I love On the paper there is always a piece of my life For me, this is not just work, it's much more. My music is an inner fire which consumes me Why do you want to force me to suffer all this, for such a cheap subject? Let me convince you Let me tell you the start Imagine a man wrapped in a broad cloak Crossing a forest surrounding a sumptuous palace It's snowing, it is night and there is a huge full moon in the sky The light shining through the trees is not white, but rather blue in this sleepy setting we see a man with his face covered by a wide-brimmed hat The man is, you will have guessed it, Don Giovanni who has decided to seduce Dona Ana, a young nobleman In an upstairs bedroom a beautiful young woman, exactly, Dona Ana is sleeping in a big bed. Through her thin and immaculate white nightgown, a beautiful body can be seen, but we can't see her face because she has her back to us Her sleep is restless, her long hair scattered over the pillow the door to the balcony is open and through the curtains moved by the evening breeze appears the shape of Don Giovanni who enters the room of Dona Ana he undresses Don Giovanni doesn't control himself anymore and whispers, rapturous, into the ear of Dona Ana "Dona Ana, my love, my life" Dona Ana, my love, my life Dona Ana then realizes that she wasn't making love to her fiance' but to a stranger. Help! Help! Feeling exposed, Don Giovanni jumps out of bed and rushes to pick up his clothes, putting them on the run he gets out from the balcony, he jumps the rail, he drops onto the grounds surrounding the mansion and flees toward the forest while Dona Ana looks from the balcony, always screaming. In the end Don Giovanni disappears between the spectral trees A truly brilliant opening, it is sensual, bold! Obviously, all that I have narrated, represents only the background. What do you mean? But dear Mozart, we can't start an opera with such a scene. It would be a scandal. Such an opera wouldn't run Don't remember the recommendations of Salieri? What do I care of Salieri's recommendations? OK - but how to start? We start from outside the mansion With Don Giovanni jumping from the balcony and running? Before fleeing, Don Giovanni, should fight a duel with the Comendatore Dona Ana's father, who came to her rescue The Comendatore draws his sword and confronts Don Giovanni it is an uneven duel, given the ability of Don Giovanni Don Giovanni kills the Commander with a stab in the chest That murder represents the premise of the entire plot because once the comendatore is dead he will return at the end of the opera as a marble statue. But do you want to start this way? Dropping into the middle of a duel without allowing the public any preparation, any introduction. While Don Giovanni enters the bedroom of Dona Ana there is somebody under the balcony And who is it? Leporello Leporello? Of course, Leporello, Don Giovanni's servant! who because the follies of his master's romantic loves is always in a lot of trouble How original! A servant in the part of the buffoon: Whenever you want to get a laugh but you haven't inspiration then you invent a servant or a maid in trouble because of love Leporello. Congratulations, da Ponte Leporello, yes I struggle night and day Lorenzo Yes, love? You have promised me a beautiful scene. An aria in which I can show off all my abilities You know me so well. Write me a beautiful aria, love Yes, love Lorenzo I love you I love you too, Adriana. I struggle night and day for the one who is always displeased To withstand rain and wind... Bad food and poor sleep; I want to be a gentleman... I do not want to serve more... A drink of milk Wolfi, you have composed so little You have been wearing yourself out all morning at it? Please, love, I'm working What's the matter? That's not like you to spend so many hours on so few lines It is not easy. This is the first aria of the opera, the cornerstone. It must win the public quickly Come on, forgive me. "I struggle night and day for the one who is always displeased" Stanzi dear, let me compose in peace, eh? Anyway, it's time to quit. You mustn't be late. Late for what? For today's lesson, Great God! Wolfiie! I forgot! Let's send a messenger to cancel it. What are you saying? Costanza, I have to work. I can't go! Hurry. That lesson is money and we need it, now you clean up and go. Stanzi, Stanzi Teacher, teacher, are you okay? Yes, yes of course, dear, yes. Can we repeat from the beginning? Yes What do you think about it? It is part of your next opera? Yes, yes And.. by chance your librettist is Lorenzo da Ponte? Yes. Do you know him? Yes. For years, in Venice, he was a friend of my father I want to be a gentleman and to give up my servitude. and to give up my servitude. no, no, no, I do not want to serve anymore. Not bad, not bad, Leporello Right after Leporello ends "No, no, no, and to give up my servitude." you go on stage breathless still trying to dress after fleeing Dona Ana's bedroom Dona Ana dressed only in a nightgown follows Don Giovanni and yells, because of the shock and from contempt because this stranger has abused her while she was sleeping She holds the arm of Don Giovanni who tries desperately to get loose but she resists his shakes and jerks You, take care to conceal your face with your cloak Dona Ana shouldn't see you, you are a stranger to her. Thus. Try, try! There's no hope, unless you kill me, that I'll ever let you go! Idiot! You scream in vain. Who I am you'll never know! People, servants! The traitor! Keep quiet! Beware my wrath! Scoundrel! Fool! Very good, very good There's no hope, unless you kill me, that I'll ever let you go! Idiot! You scream in vain. Who I am you'll never know! What a racket! Heaven, what screams! My master in another scrape! People, servants! The traitor! Keep quiet! Beware my wrath! Scoundrel! Fool! We will see if this rascal will be the ruin of me! This desperate fury is aimed at destroying me! Scoundrel! Fool! Leave her alone, wretch, and defend yourself. Go away! I disdain to fight with you. Thus you think to escape me? If I could only get out of here! Go away! I disdain you! Thus you think to escape me? Unhappy man! So be it, if you want to die! Help! I've been betrayed! The assassin has wounded me! Ah, already the wretch has fallen, and he gasps for air. And from my heaving breast I see my soul escaping, From his heaving breast I already see his soul escaping... What a misdeed! What a crime! I can feel my heart beating hard from fright! I don't know what to do or say... Very good, very good, gentlemen. Perfect. A good break for all. Lady Cavalieri, magnificent. Magnificent! Commendatore, perfect. Perfect! A couple of things... Excuse me Annetta? It is really you? I told Mozart that I would like to attend the staging of an opera I was hoping to find you, Lorenzo, but at the same time, I was afraid of seeing you Afraid? Why? You ask me? The first time I saw you that morning in Venice was like a dream for me. It was a feeling I never had known before. But a moment later, you escaped from me as if you were in front of the devil himself Annetta. Before my eyes I found a purity a harmony I would never have imagined could be of this world. in short, life gave me an undeserved gift and I felt unworthy, without a vocation. My father finds out about your exile and the fact that you had come here to Vienna he wanted to meet you and talk with you, but he was too old and too ill to travel. Sorry! And so, after his death I decided to leave Venice and move here, to Vienna But why didn't you look for me immediately? I did not want to be one of your many trophies, Lorenzo What do you mean? Your reputation as a womanizer. Your dissipated life. Wait These are verses that I have dedicated to you. It's your name on it. They are for you. There you will give me your hand, there you will tell me "yes". You see, it is not far; Let us leave, my beloved. Annetta My love In fact, nothing changes if I believe you or not What do you mean? It's too late How, too late? I am promised, Lorenzo, I'm getting married next month With whom? Not with you. Scuse me. Adriana, what a surprise What are you doing here? Who is that? Who? Don't play the innocent! Who's she? Anneta di Fiorini, Mozart's pupil You're jealous? For all I know, she can not sing. You started rehearsals without telling me and you ask me that? You promised me the lead role and instead you exclude me I'll become a laughing stock in Vienna What are you saying, darling? Today we just talked introductory scenes Of course, you want that Cavalieri bitch to warm your bed and you, in exchange for her favors, will give her the part of the protagonist Adriana please come to your senses This jealousy, you are raising to madness I had to promise the Cavalieri a small role in order to be supported by Salieri Without it, the court would never have approved "Don Giovanni" What about me? I must make few corrections, we're almost finished and I promise you within a few days to begin the rehearsals. Stop believing that you hardly turn your back and I follow any skirt that passes by or even La Cavalieri It's ridiculous You are! Are you the only one? My Nightingale Gentlemen, I present you Lorenzo Da Ponte, my lover the one who has sworn to me love and faithfulness and who after so many lies, now leaves me without even having the courage to tell me to my face Leave me alone, diabolical madwoman! This is how you repay me, wretch, after everything I've done for you? Maestro, Maestro! Finally. I have searched for you all over Vienna. I must speak with you. I hope I am not disturbing you. Not at all, Da Ponte, not at all. It's a big problem. Let me guess, you have no new scenes. I wish it was that. The Ferrarese has slain the Cavalieri? No. Has the Cavalieri slain the Ferrarese? They have slaughtered each oher. I'm serious, Mozart. Today I left the Ferrarese Understand now the seriousness of the trouble Understand, I understand well. It is the Ferrarese who wants to behead you! Forgive me, Da Ponte, I didn' want to laugh at your misfortune but this woman can be poisonous as a snake. I wouldn't want to be in your place. If you want to accept my advice, wait. Time erases everything. But... but then you didn't understand? We are embroiled in this disgrace, you, me and the opera. What does me and the opera do with your love affairs? That woman is vengeful and spiteful and I have the feeling that to strike me she will do everything to destroy our "Don Giovanni" Believe me. We are facing a Machiavelli in corsets. Machiavelli in corsets. But why do you think this, if she has no role in the opera? That's exactly the point: I promised her a main role which in reality doesn't exist A main role? How about a proud woman whom he seduced and then he abandoned, who has vowed revenge? Of course. Thus, in addition to Dona Ana, we will have another angry woman who want to revenge I hope at least that this second lady is not called, exactly, Adriana Ferrarese How does Dona Elvira sounds to you? Why these sighs? Why this anguish? That ungrateful wretch betrayed me, made me miserable, O Lord. He betrayed and abandoned me, but I still would forgive him. When I feel my dreadful anguish, my heart cries out for vengeance. But if I gaze upon his features, my heart still beats with excitement. After our first meeting, I asked myself: Should be enough for a man of your depth as a legacy, a book of memoir? and then I thought that Lorenzo is so similar to you, and the fact that you suggested so cunningly to Lorenzo the Don Giovanni is in part a reflection of your life So? Would you be happy if Don Giovanni would become a faithful little husband? Explain yourself better, if you please Your Lorenzo is convinced that he met the woman of his destiny. He is in the seventh heaven and he was right to share the bliss of his new love with... Don Giovanni... You are a jealous woman. You are starting to bore me There are not little games, you may assure yourself This is the wedding scene written in his own hand. He distributed it yesterday What do you want from me, Adriana? Annetta. Annetta is her name, and she comes from his Venetian past I have the impression that this woman wouldn't like to know anything about the love affairs that Lorenzo claimed that time Go ahead, read You noticed that I have modeled Lorenzo on my personality recording all his conquests, I assure you, with particular care You can copy that list, if you wish Some names can be skipped, they are stories I have heard Of course, we should avoid that Lorenzo knows Son of a bitch. Even Gertrude, my maid! You are also there, on that list! Good morning. I'm Lorenzo Da Ponte. I have come to see Miss Annetta di Fiorini. Is she at home? Sorry, I do not know. I have to go see. Lorenzo what are you doing here? I have come to pay you a complimentary visit. I brought you some flowers I am promised, as I have told you already. I can not accept them. Annetta? Who is it? You don't understand, these are not for you. Please, come in the room, sir Let me introduce myself. My name is Lorenzo I know who you are, Mr. Da Ponte. Pleased to meet you, Madam di Fiorini. I had the chance to meet your brother an wonderful man with a heart of gold My brother, may he rest in peace, was an idle who squandered at the gaming tables his family heritage but I beg you, Mr. Da Ponte. Be seated. Adele? Put these flowers in a vase. Excuse the mess, we were just finishing folding sheets No, it is I who should apologize for having barged in, without permission Let me help you at least in your domestic chores which I interrupted. I told my aunt that you are writing the libretto for a new opera of master Mozart You must know that we two were delighted with "The Marriage of Figaro" I'm flattered and I hope with all my heart that you will like also this new opera. Why have you come here, Lorenzo? I thought we had already said it all But you haven't said that we shouldn't ever see each other. And even if you had told me, I wouldn't have abide Why don't you anticipate a little? What is the subject of this opera? Well, actually it is the story of a libertine an argument which at first sight might seem imoral but it is treated in a manner that reaches a high morality ending. It narrates, in fact, the story of a vicious man who imposes the weakness and emptiness of his vices on pure and deep feelings Until one day, when he finds a woman who make him feel love as he didn't felt it before He decides to change and to give his life to this woman who seems to him a redeeming angel. Forgive me if it sounds indiscreet, but all this is part of your wedding trousseau? You are indiscreet, Mr. Da Ponte. But no, just to satisfy your curiosity. but now I beg you, keep telling me, who is this redeemer angel? A young lady, alas, already promised to another one. His love therefore seems impossible He is desperate but he doesn't give up. Her feelings for him are the same but she doubts of his sincerity. In the end she realizes that his love is authentic As you can see, the story ends happily and in a totally moral way. I'm not engaged, Lorenzo I'm not about to get married Annetta, can you still doubt me? Why don't you open the door, Annetta? Pardon me. Miss, someone brought this for you. I do not want to see you anymore! I do not want to hear you again! You and all your whores! Leave this house immediately, get out of my life! And don't you ever try to come here again! Stanzi You worked overnight again You promised that you would care for your health You can not continue. Your health is already bad enough Do not worry, it's just fatigue A good hot coffee and I'll be as good as new I'll fix you something, but you must lie down in bed Don Giovanni! Don Giovanni! You invited me to dinner with you, and I came... Wolfi? Wolfi! My dear! Slowly, slowly It's nothing. It is only a slight attack. I'm fine. I'm fine Why don't you send to the devil this Don Giovanni that is ruining your health? What are you saying, Costanza? The work is almost complete and besides, wasn't you who insisted to accept it? I don't know. It was a serious error. This damn opera is destroying you. Come, don't be so dramatic I must finish the opera. I must return the advance. We can't afford it. And besides, Don Giovanni is a splendid work Splendid! The adventures of a crazed and vicious pig is a wonderful story? This kind of crap is agreed by your friend Da Ponte who isn't better than Don Giovanni Maestro Casanova Lorenzo explained to me that you are the true inspiration for our opera How exciting I am to think that you are creating music for Don Giovanni! My words are not simple flattery, this is one of the most important moments of my life I thank you very much Let me introduce you to our Leporello Pleased to meet you! And our Don Giovanni. Very pleased! Young, beautiful! We are waiting for Dona Elvira who undoubtedly will be here soon Is this true, Lorenzo? Yes. The perfume of the theater She is here Oh, what a beautiful surprise, Sr. Casanova You are always so beautiful, Adriana Our Lorenzo is really ingenious! Your ideas are so striking that I often am amazed... .. where do you get such inspiration? Let's sit in the stalls, so you can attend the preview I read here about the conquests of Don Giovanni in Italy: 320 Scuse mr this impulse of national pride but I wonder why so few... .. It could easily give the impression that our hero despises the Italian beauties Why don't we make it double, 640? In Spain also is mentioned 703... Gentlemen, we're talking about the greatest seducer in the whole world! It is impossible that at home, his spoils are so low! so let's abound it..., let's say... One thousand and three? One thousand and three?.. One thousand and three. My dear lady, this is the list Of the beauties my master has loved, A list which I have compiled. Observe, read along with me. In Italy, six hundred and forty; In Germany, two hundred and thirty-one; A hundred in France; in Turkey, ninety-one; But in Spain... But in Spain already one thousand and three. Among these are peasant girls, Maidservants, city girls, Countesses, baronesses, Marchionesses, princesses, Women of every rank, Every shape, every age. In Italy, six hundred and forty; In Germany, two hundred and thirty-one; I certainly don't wish to intrude on what the muses whisper to you but it seems to me that I discovered that your idea for the end of the opera is "to reform" Don Giovanni... to marry him to... well, the greatest love of his life! Is it true? All nonsense! Who told you such nonsense? Women of every rank, Every shape, every age. With blondes it is his habit To praise their kindness; In brunettes, their faithfulness; In the white-haired, their sweetness. In winter he likes fat ones. In summer he likes thin ones. He calls the tall ones majestic. He calls the tall ones majestic. The little ones are always charming. small is always charming, You are right, who loves only one woman is nothing but a selfish He seduces the old ones For the pleasure of adding to the list. His greatest favourite Is the young beginner. It doesn't matter if she's rich, Ugly or beautiful; If she wears a skirt, You know what he does. If she wears a skirt, You know what he does. You know what he does. Okay, very good, very good, gentlemen. Thank you! Excuse me just a moment, Giacomo. I'll be right back. I'm sorry about your father, Wolfgang and my deepest condolences. Thank you, Lorenzo. No... no Do not leave me alone. I loved my father. He sometimes has been unfair, cruel in his relationship with me. He forced me to play the piano instead of letting me play with other children. But I was a child prodigy, I was touched by the gods. The people made me compliments, they applauded me everywhere I went and my father picked up the benefits I choked in the world he built around me He urged me to earn always more money, more money, more money. Always for the sake of the family. One day he said if I didn't do that, the devil would have taken me. What do you think about it? It's just as he said. The devil would have taken me. I loved him, despite that A lot... I loved him and I was afraid of him. I feared his reproaches, his criticisms He walked away from me when he realized that my music was better than his. He was jealous, understand, jealous of his own son! Of all the people who loved me. He sought to take control of my life. He said what I should and shouldn't do. And above all, he hated Costanza. When I married her, he wrote me a letter in which he said I was indebted to him for all the money he had invested in me. How does that sound? That's stinginess Sometimes in my thoughts, my dreams... .. I wanted his death. Move on, Mozart! You are shocked and that's all! You must only overcome this tragedy and there's no way better than working. No, I can't continue with Don Giovanni My wife is right, it's harming me. I must quit it. What are you saying? But don't you understand? If I finish this opera I also lose my soul! But it is ridiculous. Please come to your senses! If you feel such an oppressive weight inside you, go see a priest. And get yourselves a good absolution So why do you not give me absolution? Hold on. That's not what I meant Aren't you maybe, a priest? Yes, yes, but long ago... Lorenzo, I beg you If you are truly my friend, free me from this torment! Kneel I absolve you from your sins. In the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit. Amen. Amen. Bravo, bravo You had a magnificent idea to bring me here. Now the best thing you can do is to forget Annetta. Stop thinking about that woman. Well. That depends on you. Have you decided to dedicate her a serenade? It is your fault that I am broken-hearted What do you mean? It's been you who led me to rediscover Annetta. You are the guilty on. Oh! The Vizier arrives! Are you bored, my beauty? Yes, my great love. Without you, time drags into eternity My love, I bring you this jewel, as a sign of my love You don't know the service this does me. When a musician falls sick at the last moment is difficult to find a replacement in time For me it's an honor to play among so many virtuosos Only I don't know if I'll be worthy, you see? No, it's just a little stage fright Annetta, you're my best student. You will see that everything will go well Once you start to play, fear disappears altogether. Be calm. I thank you Master... Are you sure... That he won't come? Absolutely sure Which ring do you prefer? This Ah, the biggest. Yes All right. At last we are free, my dearest Zerlina, of that boor. Tell me, my dear, didn't I handle it neatly? Sir, he is my husband Who? That one? Do you suppose an honourable man, a noble cavalier, as I believe myself to be, could permit such a lovely little face, such sweet beauty to be stolen by a clumsy oaf? But, sir, I promised to marry him. That kind of promise means nothing. You were not made to be a peasant girl. Another fate is called for by those roguish eyes, those lovely lips, those slender, perfumed fingers, so soft to the touch and smelling of roses. Ah, but I don't wish... What don't you wish? To be deceived in the end. I know that you cavaliers are only rarely honest and sincere with women. Oh, a mere slander spread by common folk. True nobility can be seen in the honesty of one's eyes. Come now, let's not waste time. I want to marry you on the spot. You! Of course, me. That little villa there is mine, we will be alone and there, my jewel, we will be married. There you will give me your hand, there you will tell me "yes". You see, it is not far; Let us leave, my beloved. I'd like to, but yet I would not. My heart trembles a little. It's true I would be happy, but he may just be tricking me. Come, my dearly beloved! I'm sorry for Masetto. I will change your life! Soon I won't be able to resist. Come, come...! There you will give me your hand. I'd like to, but yet I would not. There you will tell me "yes". My heart trembles a little. Let us leave, my beloved. But he may just be tricking me. Come, my dearly beloved! I'm sorry for Masetto. I will change your life. Soon I won't be able to resist. Let us go! Let's go! Let us go, let us go, my beloved, to soothe the pangs of an innocent love, Let us go, let us go, my beloved, to soothe the pangs of an innocent love. So? How did it go? It went very well And Annetta? She played perfectly! But I didn't mean that! What did she say? After the rehearsal she left immediately. And about me? Didn't she say anything? Now you must have patience, and you must give her time to reflect alone. Meantime why don't you think at something else? Perhaps finishing the final scenes of the opera I remind you that we have the opening night in less than a week. You will catch a cold out here. Will you stay for dinner? Lorenzo. Lorenzo! Lorenzo. Lorenzo Da Ponte! Come and make love to me. Come on, it's so cold tonight. I'll warm you up. Then tomorrow Lorenzo, I will wait for you. I left the door open for you Were you so sure that would have come? No... but I hoped and now you are with me. Good heavens, Lorenzo, you are burning. Wait Don Giovanni has invited to dinner the statue of the commander that he had killed in a duel. Certainly he hadn't thought the commander would have accepted his invitation. Let's get to the point. "Repent!" Change your ways, for this is your last hour! No, no, I will not repent. Let me be! Repent, scoundrel! No, you old fool! Repent! No! Repent! No! No! Are you really convinced, Lorenzo? "No"? Why shouldn't he at least once renounce to this dull trip to hell and go instead to paradise? An aim would save his soul. "The fair price for those who till the end have been slaves of earthly pleasures." Let him save his soul! Let her say no. No Don Giovanni assumes his own responsibility Otherwise he would be a hypocrite That's what exactly you preached - "a moment of earthly life is worth more than all eternity" I... I have said that? Well, so what? Why should you send him into the eternal fire? Maybe because you recognize me in him and you want to condemn me. No, Giacomo. It is I whom I recognize in Don Giovanni. If so, his fall would be also yours. Only of a part of my life. The part from which I want to break free But, why? Why? For her? For a loving relationship. Falling in love! All my lessons wasted! Freedom! Free...! Maybe you don't approve the fact that Lorenzo and I are in love Sorry. But I react according to my conscience. Oh, sir, for pity's sake don't leave the room! The man of stone, the man in white, ah, master, I'm afraid, I'm going to faint. If you could see what he looks like, if you could hear how he moves! Ta, ta, ta, ta! I understand none of this. Ta, ta, ta, ta! You've gone out of your mind. Ah, listen! Someone knocks. Open the door! I'm afraid! Open it, I say! Ah! Lunatic! To put an end to it I shall have to go myself. I have no wish to see that again, so quietly I'll hide. Don Giovanni, you invited me to dinner and I have come! I never would have believed it, but I will do what I can. Leporello, see to it that another dinner is served at once! Ah, sir! Ah, master, we are lost. Go, I said! Wait a moment! He who dines on Heavenly food has no need for the food of the mortals! Other more serious considerations have caused me to come here! I feel as if I have a fever, for I cannot control my limbs. Speak then! I feel as if I have a fever, for I cannot control my limbs. What do you ask? What do you wish? I will speak. Listen! My time is short Speak then, for I am listening, I will speak. Listen! My time is short Speak then, for I am listening, You invited me to dinner, now you know your duty. Answer me: Answer me: will you come to dine with me? Oh my! Excuse him, but he doesn't have time. No one will say of me that I have ever been afraid. Make up your mind! I have done so already! You will come? Tell him no! My heart beats firmly. I'm not afraid: I'll come! Give me your hand upon it! Here it is! Oh me! What is wrong? What is this deadly chill? Repent! Change your ways, for this is your last hour! No, no, I will not repent. Let me be! Repent, scoundrel! No, you old fool! Repent! No! Repent! No! Yes! No! Ah, your time is up! What strange fear now assails my soul! Where do those flames of horror come from? No horror is too dreadful for you! Come, there is worse in store! Who lacerates my soul? Who torments my body? What torment, oh me, what agony! What a Hell! What a terror! What cries, what laments! How he makes me afraid! No horror is too dreadful for you! Come, there is worse in store! What torment, oh me, what agony! What a Hell! What a terror! Ah! Thank you. Thank you gentlemen, thank you.Thanks to all Gentlemen... Bravo, Bravo my dear Mozart! A great work. Bravo! Thank you, your Majesty. Yes, it is a good work but... .. the question is... how shall I say... I think it is a heavy food for my Viennese subjects. Your majesty, if the food is heavy, allow them time to digest it. Right? What impertinence, majesty! Mozart is finished Thank you, Mozart. Thank you for your sensibility and wisdom. It is I who thank you, Da Ponte It has worth it. I was infected by you and by your own demons.. And also by mine. Thank you. Thank you for coming! Congratulations, really special Magnificent performance, congratulations Thank you Annetta Did you like the opera? Are you Don Giovanni? Lord. Try to behave more appropriately And who are you to tell me how to behave? This is Lorenzo Da Ponte The opera librettist It is unworthy. I wonder why somebody would be recounting the exploits of a libertine with such an impudence! I really liked it! and the music was beautiful W. Amadeus Mozart died three years after the first Viennese performance of Don Giovanni at the age of 35 years Lorenzo Da Ponte died in New York, married with children, at the age of 87 years
