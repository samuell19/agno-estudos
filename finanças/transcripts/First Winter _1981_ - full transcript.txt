Long ago, there was a poor family, because they had famine in their land, had to leave it. They travelled across the rough seas in search for another place to live and the place they came to was dark and cold and very lonely. There were wild animals and huge forests. The family had a shanty in the middle of the forest. Their father had to leave them to find work cutting down the great oak and pine. Their mother grew sick and because there wasn't enough potatoes to eat, she died. The poor children had to try and live on their own. The little boy became very lonely and wouldn't do as his sister asked, he hardly spoke to her though she was very lonely and frightened, as well. He said they would die and so they would, if he didn't help. At last, they became friends again. The little boy was as good as gold. They chopped down the trees and cleared the forest as far as their eyes could see. Soon everybody knew about the two fine children who ruled the forest. The girl grew to be a great lady, renowned in wisdom. And the boy grew to be the strongest and most noble man in all the land. ♪♪♪ Thomas began to live the story that from his misery Leave some of it for Ayaddy, Thomas. - He'd better hurry up, if he's coming.
