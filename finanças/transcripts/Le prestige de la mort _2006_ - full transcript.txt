DEATH'S GLAMOUR Mr. Moullet, I love everything you do, I adored your project, a woman who wants her son to marry the daughter of the man she wants, it's fantastic! I'm fan of Thomas Hardy. I loved "The Turn of the Screw", and "Bitter Victory", what class! Hello? Hello? Yes, Anne-Marie speaking. Shit! We can't have the exclusive for the interview with Van Damme? I'm on the other line, I'll call you back. Bugger... I'm in trouble! Did Marie-Anne get it? Bitch! It's very romantic, but I can't. The heads of TF1 are hard to convince. If we had Jean Reno and Laetitia Casta... If it could have someone famous, I don't know, Depardieu as a diver or Djamel Debouze as a vicar. And no black and white. In the 21st century, you've got to have colour. We could do something on you, it would be good in my collection. I'm really in a hurry, let's talk later. I'll do everything I can, don'tworry. Urgh, he's hard to get rid of! - Anne-Marie, can I go to the toilet? - No! Close the window, he might come back in through it! You already filmed some of "Desperate Remedies" in England But not in the same season, I have to start again now. Your fly's open, do it up! Arielle, your thumb! Let me see your rucksack... Look, it's open! You have to close it before you go out! Look, everything's falling out! Look at the crumbs! - No, I never drop them! - Yes you do! It's full of crumbs! - No, no! - Yes, it is! Shall I take you to the station? I'm afraid of the car, you know that! - Take the underground! - Hello? It's Bernard. I've got news. Anne-Marie won't do your programme... and my partners have pulled out. Mr. Mookett, Mr. Ungevnach. Don't worry, we start with less money. Mr. Mockett, DASS on line 2. You have to film closer than the U.K. and what with the unions there... - What about Fontainebleu? - Why not the Provence Alps? Why not? I know loads of people in Marseille. I can't give you a penny for filming, I can't invest anything now. I'll advance the money... Don't take it to heart, Luc. It'll all be okay in three months. Get rid of the indoor scenes, the night scenes, there's no alternative. If you film in the summer, you'll save on costumes. Bye. The chocolate bars. "Her face was seductive, "although less so than the rest of her... 'Which bordered on perfection. "But even this quality... "took second place to the grace of her movements. "From a bay in Lulwind, "Lizzie watched the smugglers of French alcohol. "Under Victoria's reign, the English farmers were too poor... "to live without this traffic." It's not bad here. It rains less than in Cornwall and it's warmer... and I wouldn't have to get the Eurostar, which costs a fortune! But where will I put Lizzie? Ah, it's not bad there... yes, yes! Lizzie, but where is she? Lizzie, Lizzie! Ah, there she is! It's perfect there! The sea... It's not too early! And the smugglers? That's better, we don't have to spend on costumes. "Let's see what's underground. Help me dig. "Gracefully as an elephant, he took the spade and went into the pit. "The policemen placed the bag by his side and tried to look inside. "It looked like a large package. "He was about to open it, when a thread caught his eye. "He took hold of it, it was sticky. "He examined the almost invisible strand between his thumb and forefinger. It was a woman's long hair." Help! Help! Charles-Albert Duport Anxionnaz... Charies-Albert Duport Anxionnaz. TOURISM OFFICE FRENCH SKI SCHOOL There aren't many people here, there's no reception for mobiles. Don't worry when they announce on TV that they've discovered my body. Another one of your scams! And Arielle, what will I tell her'? She's too sensitive, she'll be in shock! This is my chance, it'll be an enormous scoop. I'll sell all my films! 30 out of 33 haven't been shown on ARTE yet, Death is me best remedy! It's a daring plan! It'll never work! My reappearance will be a great sensation... And I'll have a load of money for my film! The best time to reappear is February. Death will win me a César. Look at De Roubaix, Eustache, Cyril Collard. Or I'll wait for April... because now I remember... that Peter Finch got an Oscar two months after... Death made Van Gogh, Kafka and Truffaut fashionable again. Remember that. Love you. One tea with lemon. Are you looking for a route? I want to go up the Gerbier. My husband Charies-Albert took the direct route, but I've heard nothing. Let's call the rescue... no, wait, I'll do you a sketch. It's easy. Looks complicated to me. I'll show you the road if you want. I was there this morning, and I'm going near there. It's a bit late now. I'm really worried. I was afraid of a motorbike accident, given that he rides at 250 an hour. He's training for Monte Carlo, that's his Aprilia there. He won two years ago. If you've come from there, perhaps you saw him! He's wearing check trousers, I think they're a 32... multicoloured, with vertical stripes. He's got loads of things to do! He's got to sign a decree and tomorrow he has to inaugurate a bridge, the beautiful bridge he renovated. CHARLES-ALBERT BRIDGE Shall we go? The cable car's coming. Shall we go? Can you help me? I've got sciatica, it's terrible... Which leg? Ah, the right. I can feel the sciatica! I've done a massage course, come on, I'll massage it. - No, I'll be OK! - Yes! This is the sketch, I'll try and catch you up. Do you need a hand? Where can I contact you if I have some news about your husband? - I'm Xaviére-Emilie, and you? - I'm, I'm... If it's important you can call me on 06... 69696969. It's turning nasty, listen to the weather forecast. "The fog will lift this evening. Jean-Luc Godard is dead. "The pioneer of the nouvelle vague, was 76 years old." Don't take it so hard! No, I owe him everything to him! - Do you work in film? - No, he taught me to play tennis. And he made the best films of all time! - He, he... - Want something to drink? No, I'm fine. Come to think of it, perhaps I saw your husband on La Moucherolle yesterday. It's 5 km from here, with the other cable car. It's not too early. I have to sign a decree so they can start the search. Change of plan. I have to go and remove Anxionnaz's body so that it's not discovered today... by his wife or by planes. The media will talk about Godard, my death will disappear. What a swine that Jean-Luc is! His last films were too repetitive, and they might overshadow my death. After all my efforts... Edward wants to expose Manson, the bigamist, before marrying Lizzie. Sally, what colour are this alleged Mrs. Manson's eyes? If I tell you, will you give me wood? Aren't you ashamed, at your age? - Half a cubic metre. - Alright. - Alright what'? - She's got dark brown eyes. It's her. Mrs. Manson is alive, and he's a bigamist. - What'll you do with all this wood? - Sell it to pay for my studies. - What studies? - Architecture, obviously. It's hard to make a name for yourself, there's lot of male architects about... With all those churches to repair... Agriculture is done for. The factory's hard work. Architecture's all that's left, it's the only solution. I'll get filthy rich. I'll buy back the castle and spit in everyone's faces! I'll take on an apprentice and I'll have loads of work! - When did you see Mrs. Manson? - Last Sunday. You're not telling me stories, are you? Look at her, she's going to mass. - Does he go with Mrs. Manson? - No, he's got sciatica. Shall we go into town? Edward hurries to arrive before Manson deflowers his Lizzie. Help! GODARD DEAD I'm near the spa centre, I'll be there in about 3 minutes. - Good morning, sir. - Good morning! - It's chilly today, isn't it? - It's chilly today... - It's chilly today... - Yes... It's chilly today. I'd like a frame like this, with placebo lenses. I'd like a frame like this, with placebo lenses. I understand, but what do you mean by "placebo lenses"? Lenses like crystal, glass, like a window, an opening... As if I didn't wear glasses, so I can see exactly like before. - Clear lenses. - Yes, those. - May I ask you a question? - Of course! Why do you want them? Wouldn't it be easier to not wear glasses? You're funny, if you carry on like that you'll have no more business! With computers there are more and more eyesight problems... - What is your problem? - My problem... It may not seem like it, but it's for my work. I look more mature with glasses. - What do you do? - Me... assistant DVD decoder. - Good morning, madam. Chilly today. - Do you think so? I'm here for a haircut and also for my beard. I like a haircut that's a bit more modern and shave all this off... 3 cm wide for the moustache and don't touch the sideburns! Are you sure? I don't think it suits your look. Let me suggest a cut that's better for you. No, no, like that! I'm sorry, but it really doesn't suit your face! And my beard, a small square like this and shave off all the rest. It'll be horrible! What'll my customers say if you leave the salon like that? You've got an emergency exit, haven't you? Leave it to me, you'll thank me for it! Have a look round, someone'll have seen that madman driving about! Inspector Julie Manon. Inspector Julie Manon. Are you Charles-Albert Duport Anxionnaz? I think I recognise you. You're wife is worried, you should contact her. I'll call off the search for you. I'm not that man! You must continue the search, no, increase it. Papers, please. Show me your papers, or I'll take you into headquarters. It's true, I am Duport Anxionnaz, but it's a secret. I'm here with my mistress, understand... - I don't want my wife to know. - I don't want to know. Listen, I just want to be left in peace, then I'll ask for a divorce and everything will be fine. I'll give you something for your trouble, if you want. - 100 euros enough? - That won't work with me! The price is 140. OK. And it's customary to tip here, too. No, smaller notes, they're handier. I haven't got any. Alright. Don't tell my wife and carry on searching, eh? It's a deal for your wife, but I didn't say anything about searching. Aeroplanes flying around for nothing, it's expensive, it's difficult... - Or 500 euros. - 500 euros?! I can't afford it! THE LAST PHOTO OF GODARD Shit, where's he gone? Tut, a woman! The body of Duport that I transformed into Moullet, has become woman. If Duport's a not transvestite. After death they go back to their old sex. Which is one more transformation, or one less. I got the wrong fault. One fault chases away the other. - Excuse me, the Des Bans path? - Yes, but it's nicer this way... - And not much longer. - Yes, but it's longer... The Des Bans path is nicer this way and there's a 5 euro prize. The Des Bans path is nicer this way, come on, don't be afraid. A 10 euro prize for all who go past, offered by the GR promotions syndicate! Look, Salomé! From that smell... ...he's been dead 5 days! Strange! He couldn't have fallen from up there. A mountain goat! Must be from Vercors! They brought a lot last summer, they're beautiful. He's been dragged for quite a few metres... - and he's got no ID. - My dear, tell me... - I've been waiting for this for years! - My dear, it's not... I recognised him at once... It's Charles-Albert Duport Anxionnaz, that famous man they're looking for. The murder of a prominent person, perhaps with political implications. It's never happened to us! Two years to retirement, I don't want a case like this on my shoulders, and we inspectors don't get overtime! If I don't find the murderer quick, I'll end up in a station by the seaside! How lovely, by the seaside! There are dolphins! And my photo'll be in Détective. Our photo, I mean. I'll outwit them on the Alps! Outside the Drôme they're out of it! The PACA'll have to slog at it, then we'll see what they can do! PACA, cacca! - He isn't yet back in the PACA! - He only needs to have a heart! He's heavy... "A 4 km tailback on the A86, which should improve towards evening. "An accident near Des Bans. "A body was found after a landslide. "It was a dachshund, but its only injury was a broken paw. "He should be OK in a week." Who cares?! Charles-Albert, hello! What a pleasure to see you! I'm here at the Grand Hotel Les Bains, come see me whenever you want! I'll phone Xaviére-Emilie to call off the searches! I'm not Charies-Albert! TRADESMAN'S ENTRANCE XAVIERE-EMILIE, I WANT A DIVORCE BECAUSE I'VE FALLEN MADLY IN LOVE. Antonietta, good news! My body will be discovered in a few hours, don't worry. I can't give you the hotel number, what if they monitor the call? Stop this nonsense! Tomorrow there's Arielle's school party, She's playing Luison! What will her classmates' parents say? She'll be upset! You've got to be here tomorrow! Just hang on a while, in a week's time, we'll be rich! - You've got a strange voice! - I must have caught a cold. - You still in there? - Just a second. Don't say too much in the interviews. They'll be angry with the truth. Tell them you don't know where the copies of my short films are. Télétoto lost quite a few of them! If they do a tribute to me on TV with just short films, I'll earn less! And I'll get less covers! Sol can donate my body to science, I'll have to have a real funeral, in my grandfather's village, which is really pretty! Donating my body to science risks drawing attention to Duport's body. Who, the ENA alumnus? Someone from ENA? Now I understand! They'll discover the scam when they see he's got the brain of a chicken. I can't stand all this chaos, the funeral... I can't put up with it! It's not fair to donate his body to science without his permission! What do you care about fairplay for someone from ENA! If you don't come to the party tomorrow, it's all over between us! I've found a body, looks like she's fallen. There's a card from the Moullet Alpine Club, profession... uniast. Captain, it must be cineast! Cineast doesn't mean anything! Uniast means someone who unites things! It's over. Another body found on Mont Angéle. The victim is... DIRECTOR LUC MOURLET FOUND DEAD ON MOUNTAIN. I'll prepare a complete file on Moullet for tonight, he should have got the Legion of Honour. I'll have unpublished shock photos and interviews with friends and fans. It's not interesting and impossible. All the space will be taken up by the President's conference. Hello, Antonietta? Hello, Antonietta? Hello? Shit! The conference has been postponed as the President has lost his voice. The director Luc Moullet was murdered while filming "Desperate Remedies". STRANGE DEATH OF FILMMAKER LUC MOULLET Have you got "Libé"? The newspaper van from Paris has broken down in Mariaud. To Mariaud, quick! ...forecast to be the next French coach, has denied it. A dam has burst in China, causing 1000 deaths, but there were no French. - On Mont Angéle... - The newspapers! I don't feel well, turn around! NEWSPAPERS - BOOKSHOP - STATIONARY - Shall I take you to hospital? - No, there's no need! And one "Desperate Remedies"! Excuse me, is there a more comfortable room? With a toilet and a TV antenna? My greatest regret is not having produced his last film, the only adaptation of the novel. - Shall I pull down the blinds? - No, no, no, no! No, no! After the burial, and once "Desperate Remedies" is finished, I'll make a more important and dearer trilogy... Like "War and Peace" set in the 28th century, in a space war with Hollywood stars. A Colombian "Romeo and Juliet"... Where the boss of the Medellin cartel loses his head for one of the addicts. The "Ten Commandments". And "Problems of Apnea", a struggle between two divers for who can remain underwater longer. There's a load of money to be made! Bye. No more careful. I saw you move Moullet's body. Listen here: either give me 50,000 dollars right now... Or I'll go to the police, who are looking for the murderer. It's the first time I've been treated like this! You'll pay for it, old fella! Seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven... Anne-Marie, Gérard, Bernard, Colette... Mr. Duport Anxionnaz, you are under arrest for the death of Luc Moullet. Let's go. It's ridiculous to accuse me of this murder! I'm not from Moullet's world, he's a film smuggler. I'm Charles-Albert Duport Anxionnaz, a civil servant without a category. I'll call my lawyer at once! Can you show me a document, please? It's perfectly clear! Your wife came here, she wants to divorce you for adultery... and she gave me the proof that you killed Moullet, who had insulted the people from ENA, and was planning a film against you. You also killed his bodyguard who you employed to commit many murders. You drowned the minister for social affairs to replace him, just like those from the mines department, Air France, and the Music... You had a scheme in your mind, like Edgar Faure, who was elected minister for education, defence, finance, internal affairs, the foreign office... Case closed! But I'm not Duport Anxionnaz, I'm Moullet! Be careful, I could accuse you of insulting a public official. - Give me a DNA test! - In such an obvious case? What will Nicolas say? You're mixing everything up! It's clear that some thug pushed Duport of my boots off... because Duport had tried him to kill him because he wanted to make him sing. The thug committed suicide out of remorse. Does he look like someone who commits suicide for remorse? You're right. But the man made a false step, he thought he'd seen a ghost, when he saw the head of Duport Exbrayat, that I'd taken to make them believe in my death, which, thanks to the scoop I created, would have allowed me to get money from the TV to film "Desperate Remedies". This is between us. It's the truth, I swear. So, it's simple. Even a child could understand it! - It's evident! - This'll come back on us! Stop it, please, Mr. Duport Anxionnaz! You must get your personality back and stop pretending to be Moullet. I've come to take you to your wife... who's here with your son, to talk! No, no, I'm very busy! There are 2 reels of "A Romance of Love", a lost masterpiece, I must find the others. You can find masterpieces in the film libraries of madhouses! This is a specialised medical centre, not a madhouse! I forbid you to mention madhouses! I'll let you rummage through the films if you'll meet your wife. Above all, don't talk about madhouses! - Your name please? - Xaviere-Emilie Duport Anxionnaz. - Do you have some proof of identity? - Yes. - "Eve Martin-Duport"? - Nobody calls me that anymore. Now I'm Xaviére-Emilie, it suits me better. Good morning, madam. I'm sorry, sometimes I don't feel well, like when I wrote you that letter. I'm sorry, I love you, Xaviére-Emilie. If you love me, why've you got a different voice? It's not different! Everything will be as it was before! You must understand... You monster, you're doing it so I'll go back on my word! No, I've always loved you, I love you. It'll all be like before. I adore you, Xaviére-Emilie. Oh shit! Daddy! No, I'm not your daddy, I'm Luc Moullet. I have to go! Ouch! - It's great to be back home! - Am I dreaming? It's a nightmare! Calm down, I'll stop it all. Now, we've won! - Arielle, my darting... - I don't know you! Who is it, mummy? Call me tomorrow! Just a moment, I have to get changed, I've had enough of these clothes! I'll can't go to the shops, they'll take me for Duport Anxionnaz! I want to film this scene in Australia and the next in Burundi, what do you think? For the part of Lizzie, I can't decide between... Nicole Kidman or Jennifer Lopez. I've got a great idea... To show the different between this and other films on the same theme... we'll use a 70mm, what do you think? It was good when you said on TV that your greatest regret... was not having produced my last film! I'm Moullet, do you recognise me? Moullet's dead and I don't believe in ghosts. What about you? Are you Moullet too? You're the third this week! I am Mou... Anne-Marie, you must recognise me! What a cheek, a least the others disguised themselves! I can prove it! Check with the courts... In '34 my great uncle was convicted of camel smuggling in Morocco! I wrote that in today's "Libé"! It's lucky that Moullet's dead, or I would have gone under! I've lit a fuse with Moullet's death! Some people would be happy, like that bitch Marie-Anne! Marie-Anne, I'm Moullet, I can prove it! But "Ma premiére brasse" I said that I didn't have my spleen anymore... because an alsatian's germs have devoured it. - I'll show you the scar. - That doesn't prove anything! Before the Wall came down, they used to take out the spleen of the sportsmen. I'll show you the scar of my groin hernia. Oh, get away with you! I've got a bridge, I showed it... in "Genése d'un repas". The dead man's teeth are intact. - Come and see in the cemetery. - We don't waste time at France 2. I'm not going to any cemetery, especially not in Provence! If you prove that I'm alive... you'll finish Anne-Marie, who got the scoop on my death. Wait three minutes, let's go! That bitch Anne-Marie! If I rush like mad, I'll be back for tonight's programme! Don't move! Are there any brakes in this car? Where are they? OK, OK! We'll need a shovel to dig! Get a spade as well, it'll always come in handy! That's an excellent product! It could even dig up a body! Are you insinuating I dig up bodies? Who do you take me for? Don't you realise I'm only joking? What'll you do with all that stuff? I've been waiting an hour! It looked strange otherwise! They can come in useful for the TV! I think I know her... it's my great-grandfather's sister. She died when she was 7 from enteritis. How alike we look! - If you hoed we'd be much quicker! - You need a hoe to hoe! Ah, shit! I forgot to buy one. But there's my cousin, no, my great-grandmother's cousin, who killed three guys with a hoe in 1900. He was buried here with his hoe. Just a sec, he's nearby! Let's get on with it, the interview is at 7 o'clock! Here it is! I would have like to film scene 31 of "Desperate Remedies" in Queen Victoria's England, the lovers meet at the cemetery, far away from the puritans. It's strange filming in Provence when the film's set in England! Giono said that these landscapes look like the English ones. My weltanschaung is modelled on the ontoligisation of my Yoknapatawpha. It's not true that it comes from the mountain. The spring is 800m from here. - Drink Rougnouse water, it's better. - I'm dying of thirst! Snake kebab! Try it, it's great! There are eggs in there, too! You'll like this! They used to make good hoes! It's not like the old days! - I'm okay. - It's the best remedy. You should be used to it, the TV thrives on dead people! I've done it all: I got a 50V shock to please Claude François, De Gaulle's spit, Welles' farts, I licked Duras... What a shitty job! Close your eyes, I'll tell you when you can open them! I believe you. You wouldn't have done it if it wasn't true. We didn't do it for nothing, and you'd say I was telling tales! Shit! I knew, it's a trick to make me miss the interview! How will I earn my crust? It's a conspiracy to make me lose my identity, I'm Luc Moullet! I'm Luc Moullet! A black van took the body, we have to get it back! I've had enough of this! I've imitated Duport Anxionnaz so long, I've begun to drive like him! I want 100,000 dollars for Moullet's body! I couldn't care less! It's the first time that someone's spoken to me like that! No one care's about anything anymore, there's no morality! OK, its 100,000 euros, or you'll never see your daughter again! Let's forget the past, let's start again from the beginning. We'll be rich, I'll buy you a Nissan Terrano ll, or even lll. A FILM BY LUC MOULLET
