Yes, sir! Yes, sir! Come on! Somebody! Some people think that we are crazy for taking on this fight. But the forces against us are strong and they are determined to stop us.

Now don't call me uncle Martin anymore. You make me feel old, that's the problem. I want to march. Don't look at me like I'm still a child. I'm not afraid. Oh, you're not? No. Well, damn. Then you need to be leadin' this movement and teaching me how to not be terrified of these crazy white folks. Martin... Why do you want to march? After all this time traveling with you, after all the horror we've seen, what kind of question is that? Are you runnin' from your daddy? So, you tell him you wanna march? I don't have to. It's my decision. I'm a grown woman, remember? Oh, so, you ready to orphan your kids now? Hmm? Are you? But you're doing it anyway. Because I have to. And I don't? Ree... Singing for the movement and sending people into battle with a song is not enough anymore. I need to be with them. You have a good talk? Yes. It was a good talk. Brother, come on. She's restless, I can tell. I don't know if it's restless. She just wants to do more. What kind of more? I'll be there in a minute. Momma! Clarence! Eddie! Momma! Momma! Momma! My babies!

Every time I come back, they want me less. That's not true. They talk about you all the time. Every night, I show 'em where you are on the map. One cookie. Fix your face now. This party is for y'all. How are you, mama? God is good. All the time. Amen. Let's eat. I'm starving. So, where y'all headed? We go to Tennessee, then to Georgia, then to north Carolina, and then back to Alabama, I think. Damn. Martin's tour's busier than daddy's. Erma, sometimes we hit two states in one day. What was that story about aunt mahalia not paying you? She said I would receive my reward in heaven. Oh. No, ree. Uh-uh. Uh-uh-uh-uh... Smokey... hey, hey, hey. He's got some news, ree. I heard you're cuttin' a record. Yeah, with Berry over at motown. They got some sweet sounds, ree. They're signing a bunch of folks in the neighborhood. Listen, we are trying to put Detroit on the map. You gotta be a part of it. I would love that. Yeah? Cecil, let me talk to daddy about it. Dontbnngitup unfillsay. You know what? Let's let Berry talk to him. Better yet, his sister. She can talk ice out of the devil's mouth. What are you drinking? Icedtea. Just iced tea? With a little bourbon. Yeah, you look like a bourbon girl. How long are you in town for? A week. Then I return to Tennessee. Well, then, I won't waste any time. I'd like to take you out. I'd like you to take me out. How about tonight? Come and help me set this table. Yes, to tonight. Okay. Excuse me a moment. Reverend. I put up with you coming to my house all these years 'cause you were friends with my friends. But I don't want you around here anymore. May I give you some counsel, reverend? Ephesians 6:4 says, "fathers, "do not exasperate your children. "Instead, bring them up in the training and the instruction of the lord." Lord, give me strength. Are you serious? You may wanna loosen your grip on aretha. You know, every minister's daughter I've ever known... Nigger, you don't wanna mess with me or mine. I got this. I got it. Take that off. Everyone! Everyone! Please, please, gather around. Aretha, will you join me, please? This party is not just a homecoming. It's also an announcement. God is moving us on to our next chapter. I've been talking to a number of record producers about aretha. There were many who were interested in working with her. Tell them what it is, ree. A plane ticket to New York City. Congratulations, ree. Thank you. This is it. Wow. Excuse me? I have a meeting with a John Hammond of Columbia records. Receptionist: Sign in, please. You ready? I'm ready. I've always seen aretha as more than a gospel singer. We‚Äù, clearly from her demo, she's so much more. Stand up, ree. Turn around. There can sometimes be a lack of effortlessness of the kind you find in a Lena home or a Dorothy dandridge. But what aretha lacks in formal education, she more than makes up for in experience. She has performed before every type of crowd imaginable, from small churches to audiences of thousands. You can sit down now, ree. I'm curious. Who are your favorite artists? Dinah Washington. Ella Fitzgerald. Hmm. Sam Cooke. All family friends. Sam would very much like aretha to sign with rca. Well, we can't have that. Welcome to Columbia records. Oh. Prove yourself as a jazz artist, and everything else will follow. I understand. Wonderful. Are you ready, aretha? Yes, Mr. Hammond. Wonderful. The conductor will point at you when he's ready for you to begin. You got to accentuate the positive and eliminate the negative and hang on to the affirmative but don't mess with mister in-between she sounds wonderful, doesn't she? She does. Like a black Judy garland. You got to spreadjoy up to the maximum and bring gloom down to the minimum and have faith or pandemonium is liable to walk upon the scene Ladies and gentlemen, the village vanguard is proud to present miss aretha Franklin, debuting her latest record, unforgettable. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. We hope you enjoy the show tonight. I see an old family friend. Dinah Washington is in the audience. I'd like to sing a song in honor of her great artistry and talent. This bitter bitter... Bitch! Don't you ever sing the queen's songs when the queen is in front of you! What the hell were you thinking? I'm sorry. You wanna take me on? Liar. No. You wouldn't be here if you wasn't trying to replace me and every other bitch out here singin'. How many albums have you had? Fouh and no hits. You out here, but I can see you still that little girl in your daddy's living room. You're singin' everything and anything. Shoop shoop one day, skylark the next, and then some Billie Holiday blues. Girl, you're all over the place. What do you wanna sing? I don't know. You don't know? I want hits. I just want hits. Girl, you need to let go of that "up with the race" booker t Washington proper negro shit. That's not you. Your daddy likes to pretend that's who he is, but that's not who he is either. Child, y'all church folks are some of the nastiest people out here. Ray Charles told me that the best sex he ever had was when he was singin' on the gospel circuit. Honey, find the songs that suit you. That move you. Until you do that, you ain't goin' nowhere. Put some teabags on that. Take the puffiness down. How's big mama? She's all right. The kids? They're good. Child, you ever gonna tell us who their daddy is? Ree-ree? You wanna tell me what's wrong? I can't. No answer. Call her again. Oh. There we go. I didn't know you were comin' in today, daddy. You are 68 minutes late. Mr. Hammond asked me to come in. You've been skipping interviews and gigs. The demon is back. Ree has a tendency to indulge her pain. Can we talk about this somewhere else? John.john. It's important that you understand that this behavior is not a reflection of her upbringing or her race. Well, I've worked with bessie Smith and Billie Holiday, aretha is a Saint in comparison. She wasn't raised in a whorehouse like them. She was raised in a proper home with every convenience and luxury. But still, a darkness would descend on her. I called it the demon. She'd lock herself away, wouldn't speak, move, just wallow in whatever imaginary... You told me before we came out here that you had it under control. I have control. You keep complaining that you don't have any hits. This is why you don't have any hits. Acting like a trifling... Apologize to Mr. Hammond. No, there's no need to apologize. That is not why I don't have hits. You don't pick good songs for me. Sorry for being late, Mr. Hammond. It won't happen again. I'm ready to record when you are. Please excuse me while I go to the ladies' room. So, you gonna come with us this weekend? I have a gig. We can go after your gig. You work too hard. Not according to my daddy. Well, you need some fun. Come with us. Can you introduce me to his friend? I don't know him. You were supposed to take me out in Detroit. Yes, one of my singers ran into a little trouble out of town, so I had to take care of it. I think my father said something to you to make you reconsider. That's a nice little table you got goin' on in your head. I know what you do. It doesn't bother me. I know it doesn't bother you. You're rebelling against your daddy. I don't mind. Listen, you wanna use me for my body, you can use me, baby. You can wring me dry. You and me, we've been through it. So we can skip all the flowers and the promises, and the love bullshit and just have some fun. I like fun. And we'll have plenty of it. I want one thing from you. What? To hear you sing. Just for me. What will I get in return? The best night of your life. Taxi! I want you to think about me when you sing tomorrow. You're not coming home with me? What about the best night of my life? I didn't say it would be tonight. There was a boy a very strange enchanted boy they say he wandered very far very far over land and sea a little shy sad of eye but very wise was he That very day he passed my way I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Would you like to take a break, aretha? I'll get it right this time. Take 12. You have all my records. You like them? I bought them. Which one you like best? They've all got something. Is this one your favorite? Or this? What are you doing? Or this one? Went to 64 on the charts. You didn't even open this one. You don't like them? I didn't say that. Then say it. I won't be upset. No one does. First, I've listened to all your albums. Including this one. More than once. Secondly, I love music. I take it seriously. I managed my first artist when I was 15. Thirdly, what you experienced yesterday, 17 takes on one song? That happens to me every time I hear you sing. My brain gets all muddled. Well, first, my apologies for putting you through so much pain. And secondly... uh-huh. You should have never told me about your achilles' heel. On ourfirst date... Jazz Damn it. Keep singing. I didn't think you were comin' home for two weeks. I miss my babies. And y'all. Who's that plate for? Ted. Sweet Jesus, are you serious? What are you thinking? Please help me with daddy. Help me. Good Sunday, everybody. What the hell is this? You didn't tell them I was coming? I don't know what you think you're doing here and I don't care. Just leave. Now. Aretha asked me to come and aretha can ask me to leave. I want him to stay. This is my house. Since when do you get to tell me who gets to be in my house, ree, huh? I want you to get to know him. He's not what you think. Are you pregnant again? We just wanna be together. I love your daughter, reverend. And I think she loves me. I do. No! No! Oh, my lord! Ree... Clarence! No! Didn't I tell you not to mess with me or mine? Didn't I tell you? Clarence! Son, don't you let this man put your church and your soul in jeopardy. Reverend, we have to figure this out. I'm not going anywhere. You can't see through this hustler? You're the greatest hustler ieverseen. Every night, she picks herself apart because of you. She thinks it's her hair, her body, her voice. She worries about failing you, but it's your failure. Get out! Just... Daddy, I know how busy you are. You have so much going on all the time. Running a church, the speakin' engagements, managing Carolyn. I know about your contract at horizon records. I was gonna tell you. When? When the damn album came out? Nobody can tell you anything, ree. You're so jealous. Jealous? Of you two? You think you better than us? That's exactly what she's saying. No! Quiet! Quiet! Quiet! You are not leaving this family for that piece of trash. I need a change. I wanna sing what I wanna sing and I wanna dress like I want to dress. And I want Ted to manage me. He's not worth the shit at the bottom of my shoe. So that means that you think I'm worth less than that. After all we've been through. After all that I've done for you. I have to do this, daddy. You are going to beg me to take you back. But I won't. I won't. I'm gonna say goodbye to my children. Okay. And then we'll go. Okay. Y'all not gonna fix me a plate? You keep beating up these club owners, there won't be any clubs left for me to sing at. No one disrespects us. I just don't know what else to do after nine albums... Yes, this is Ted white. I'm calling to speak to Mr. Whitfield. Well, I'd like to speak to him about aretha Franklin. Mommy can't cook either. It's sticky! I'm gonna be honest with ya. Your version of skylark is one of my favorite songs. Thank you, Mr. Wexler. Please, call me Jerry. You know what etta James said when she heard it? She said you pissed all over thatsong and she would never sing it again in her entire life. You ruined that song for etta James. That is how good it was. And I'm not bullshittin' ya, okay? A lot of these guys out here will say anything to get in your drawers, but that's not me. I'm sorry. All right, I'm crude. And you're a church girl, and I should watch my mouth. I'm sorry. You do talk, don't ya? Not just sing? You are the sweetest thing, aretha. I'd like you to call me miss Franklin. Okay, miss Franklin. What songs would you like to sing? I want hits. We're done with standards. We want original songs made for aretha only. Great! We are speaking the same language, my man. One of the songwriters I represent wrote a good song for aretha, I never loved a man. Terrific. I've got the perfect place to record it. I'm working with this little studio down in Alabama and... Aretha's only recorded in New York. Yeah, I know that, but I think that's part of the problem. It's overproduced, it's a little too polished. I mean, these boys down there... "Boys"? Don't be offended, all right? I say boys because they're young like aretha... Like miss Franklin, not because they're negroes. These guys are the best musicians I have ever worked with in my life, and that's saying something. I've been doing this a long time. They don't need to read charts. They just feel their way through the music. It's really something. How does that sound to you? Sounds good. And I'm not controlling like Hammond, okay? I'm gonna give you plenty of space to do your thing, all right? This is your show, miss Franklin. Your record. Okay? This is it? What did all the glamor at Columbia get me? Do you know who you're messing with? "Do I know who I'm..." Do you know who you're messing with, buddy? You tryin' to screw me over, Rick? You in my town now, buddy! This is my place! It's my record! Everything you see here is mine! This is my record! Miss Franklin, Ted, welcome. Jerry. Nice to see you. Hello. I'm Rick hall. This is my place. You don't have any negro musicians in this town? Uh, we were just discussing that. Not today. Not today? There was a miscommunication, Ted. Negroes only allowed to pick cotton in these parts, huh? Percy sledge had that same look on his face when he first come in here. And then he heard 'em play and he was very satisfied with his record. I think you will be, too. Dunk? Vvedonthave finmfmtmsnmflnowm I like your style. Where can I get a jacket like that? You'd have to come to Harlem. Always wanted to go to Harlem. Yeah. You're a no good heartbreaker who's this singin'? The songwriter. And you're a cheat Sings like a writer. Rick, you want drums on this? Or you just wanna keep it boring? I don't know, Roger. You know any good drummers around here? Don't, actually. It's just slow. It's just a little slow. Little slow, yeah. All right! Come on, guys! Hang with me on this. This is a good song! It's a great song. It is what it is. All right. Let's see what we can make of it. Hey, spooner you wanna keep that shuffle on there or straighten it out? Let's straighten it out. Straighten it out. Straightening out. Put some fatback on it. Yeah, like a king Curtis deal? Yeah... Hey, man, that's groovy. All right, let's go with that. Yeah. You're a no good heartbreaker you're a liar and you're a cheat and I don't know why I let you do these things... Okay, let's hold up. Hold up. It sounds like Sunday morning service in there. Yeah, I was just about to say, it's a little too churchy, guys. I liked it. Let's find a different pocket, all right? Something with more swing. Speed it up. Yeah. No, don't speed it up. Follow me. Friends keep telling me that you ain't no good but oh, they don't know I would leave you if! Could stop. Stop. It's too busy. Let the song do the work. Yeah, stop showing off, guys. Yeah, boys, ifyou're trying to impress me, it's not working. Yeah, and more importantly, it's startin' to piss me off. Maybe we should do something closer to the original arrangement. Nah. No, it's done. You kept steppin' on me. You were all over the neck. I couldn't tell what you were doing. I'm all over the neck? Find your Lane, Jimmy. Look who's talkin'. They could hear your crash in Texas. Well, my horn arrangement's killer. Y'all let me know when you're ready to hear it. You gonna save the song, Jack? As I have on many an occasion, okay. Okay. Good job, Jack. How about that. Spooner's got it! Spooner's got it! Yeah, he does. You're a no good heartbreaker you're a liar you're a cheat I don't know why I let you do these things to me friends keep telling me that you ain't no good but oh, they don't know Go on, baby. I'd leave you if! Could I guess I'm uptight and I'm stuck like glue 'cause I ain't never I ain't I ain't never, oh, no loved a man the way that! I love you, yeah Sometime ago I thought that you had run out of fools but I was so wrong you got one that you'll never lose that is rocking. Yeah, it sounds pretty good. I can do better. It's like the perfect mixture ofgospel, blues... And sex. Baby, that's some of the best singin' and playin' I've ever heard. I want to overdub some backgrounds on the chorus. You know, I was just thinkin' about that. We can bring in some local talent... No, I want to do it. Okay, even better. Save me some money. Jerry. Let me talk to you for a moment. Okay, okay. Had a rocking thing on it. Yeah, it did. It was rocking. The way that I, I love you I wasn't lookin' at nobody. I was trying to do my work. He was looking at you.

Aretha! Aretha! Smokey! Nobody is talking about motown anymore. All they want to talk about is aretha Franklin. You did it, ree. I did it. Yes, you did. What did you wish for? More hits. Aretha Franklin, you are the queen of soul. What is soul music? The musician having the biggest influence on this genre is grammy winning soul singer, aretha Franklin. From a young age, I saw aretha possess extraordinary talent. Ted is my husband, manager, and favorite critic. Hello, Ted. Right now, gospel is the main influence on contemporary rhythm and blues, and that's due to aretha. Others have mixed gospel and so-called secular music before her, but aretha puts a unique spin on it that people can relate to. It's always great when families sing together because there's a language between siblings that you can't recreate with just hired hands. Ain't no way is a song written by Carolyn for aretha, and something aretha can relate to because, I think, they know each other so well. Show me how the melody goes in the verse. Ain't no way for me to love you if you won't let me that's it. Let me try. Ain't no way for me to love you if you won't let me it ain't no way for me to give you all you need If you won't let me give all of me I know that a woman's duty is to help and love a man and that's the way it was planned oh, but how can I how can I, how can I give you all the things I can if you're tying both of my hands oh, it ain't no way ain't no way it ain't no way yeah ain't no way it just ain't no way, baby ain't no way ain't no way, baby ain't no way ain't no way for me to love you if you won't let me stop tryin' to be someone you're not How cold and cruel is a man who paid too much for what he got? And if you need me like you say say you do oh, then please please, please don't you know that I need you? Oh, it ain't no way It ain't no way baby, ain't no way it sure ain't no way ain't no way, baby so it fades right here? You genius you. You really feelin' this one, aren't you, ree? I love it. I can tell. See, so, she'sjust being completely honest in a song about what she feels at any given moment. And that's why the audience relates to her. I'm still trying to figure out who I am. I'm not sure yet, but I'm trying to find the answer. Now, I am here to honor aretha. Or ree, as I like to call her... For her tireless work for the civil rights movement. Every time I ask aretha to sing at a fundraiser, church event, or a conference, she shows up. No matter where she is or what she's doing, she always answers the call. And I am honored to present aretha with this proclamation today. And I wish that every day was aretha Franklin day! We love you, aretha! After all of that there's really only one thing left to say, right? Lookin' out on the mornin' rain I used to feel so uninspired and when I knew I had to face another day lord, it made me feel so tired before the day I met you life was so unkind but you're the key to my peace of mind 'cause you make me feel you make me feel you make me feel like a natural woman woman oh, baby what you've done to me what you've done to me you make me feel so good inside good inside and I just wanna be wanna be close to you you make me feel so alive Excuse me, miss Franklin. I'm so sorry to bother you, but I just havetotehyou. Itsahrqht when you sing, ifeelhke you are talking about my life. It helps me, because it is hard out here. But I feel like you understand, and, well, I just have to thank you. Stay strong. Okay. Yes, thank you. Thank you very much. We have to go now. I'm flying to Atlanta tomorrow to do a benefit for sncc. Cancel it. I have some meetings and interviews lined up. Daddy and Martin asked me to do it. I'm going. Aretha! Jerry. I love when you call me Jerry. It means you're not mad at me. Heho, Ted. Jerry. Come on in. Everyone wants you, miss Franklin. We've got interest in France, england, Germany... All right, we don't have to name every country. All of Europe. The entire continent wants you and I think we should schedule something. We should schedule a tour that coincides with the new album. We could do that or we could send her out now to create an appetite for the new record. I think that's best. I have six venues ready to clear this... And who are you, brother? Ken Cunningham. I'm the tour manager. Tour manager? So, you already booked the tour? It's not booked. No, he said the venues was ready. That's right. They were available if we want 'em. You have to Gauge interest early for it. I know how a tour works. Okay. No what? No European tour dates. Why not? Because we have some TV dates we'd like to schedule first. Oh, yeah? With whom? Carol Burnett, Andy Williams. Mike Douglas. All right. So, those shows will be there when she gets back. We have a chance here to expand her reach around the world. To make her a global superstar. Do you know what a rare opportunity that is? We're considering some movie offers as well. Movies? Aretha. You wanna do movies? I think I could. Of course you could. You could do any damn thing you want. You thought you could just bring us in here, tell us where to go, what to do, and send us on our way? You should know by now, Jerry, that is not the way I do business. Ken, how much money could aretha make on the tour? Quarter of a million. Carol Burnett payin' that? Movies payin' that? We'll consider it. With the right band. All right. Well, the muscle shoals guys have started their own label. King Curtis is ready to go. Curtis is rockin'. He's perfect for you. Curtis is good, but I've got some people lined up. Really? Five minutes ago, you didn't wanna go on this tour. Now, you've got people lined up? Check the tone, Jerry. Just take it easy, Ted. I'm sorry. Forgive me for my tone. What musicians do you have lined up, Ted? George Davidson. Miller brisker. Russell Conway. All right. You can't have the premier singer of our time touring Europe with a ragtag bunch of amateurs suitable for backing some third-rate blues singer in a bucket of blood in loserville, Louisiana. I want to use Ted's musicians, Mr. Wexler. "Mr. Wexler?" Oh, god... aretha, please. Can we move on to the next item on the agenda, please? Whatever you say, miss Franklin. So, they do this funny thing in Amsterdam when they really love a performer. They pelt them with flowers. Pardon me. I warned them not to get too crazy with it, but you might get hit with a few. After the show, please. After the show. Right through this door. Watch your step. Chain chain chain chain chain chain chain chain chain chain chain chain chain chain chain chain of fools for five long years I thought you were my man but I found out I'm just a link in your chain ya got me where you want me I ain't nothin' but your fool ya treated me mean, yeah oh, you treated me cruel chain chain chain chain of fools now every chain has got a weak link I might be weak, yeah but I 'ii give you strength you told me to leave you alone fix this or I'll have your job. My father said "come on home" my doctor said "take it easy" Aretha! Aretha! Can you comment on the recent time magazine cover story? Oh, I haven't read it yet, but it is a great honor to grace the cover of such a prestigious magazine. Translator: This time article says that your husband beat you in a hotel lobby. Excuse me? Is this true? No more questions! Let's go! Move. It's a lie! It's a dirty lie! Get off! Come here! No, that's too low. I want ten million dollars. They're gonna be sorry they wrote this shit. And you know, your daddy, he doesn't come across too well either. He may wanna sue 'em his damn self. How are you gonna prove that you didn't hit me? You did and everyone saw it! Another man would have killed you by now. Crazy way you act. Get out of my way. What are you gonna do, huh? What are you gonna do? I mean it. You would still be singing some al jolson shit if it wasn't for me. I wrote half your hits. Are you laughing at me? You know damn well you didn't write one word. One note of anything. I just let you put your name on it to keep you from throwing a fit. Inever loveda man came from me. My songwriter! That song wasn't anything until I rearranged it. And I sang the hell out of it because it was about you. You're a lying, no good, just useless, psychopath. No! I'm done with you. Yeah, you've said that before. You wait until your demons come back! After livin' with you, I'm ready for 'em. This song goes out to anyone who has ever felt mistreated. Two, three, four.

Listen, you're about to have the meal of your life. She put her foot in there. Smell it. Yes, I did, yes, I did. She put somethin' in there. Put herfoot in, she did. I don't know. That smells funny. Darlin', get outta there. You want me to get that, ree? Yes, answer. Get outta here! All right, put it back. Hello? And that's me. This will bring big mama to her knees, honey. You goin' to hell for that. Hey. She knows. No, no, no_. No, no, no_. What's wrong? What's wrong? Hello? What is it? What? What? It's Martin. They_. Oh, god... They shot him. Oh, god... I wanna say it one more time For the broken-hearted I want you to take my hand lord, lead me on home 'cause we gotta stand lord knows I get tired lord knows I get weak and, oh, every day every day I'm worn but, oh, Jesus through the storm Lord, I need you to hold my hand 'cause you a precious lord Precious lord Lead us home He kept telling me that they were gonna get him. But I said, "Martin, the lord has more for you to do. "You're gonna be all right." But he knew. He knew. Other ministers were jealous of him, but I never was. He was my friend. I ministered him, advised him. Prayed with him. More time than I can count. I loved him, ree. He loved you. Who's gonna lead us now? They don't listen to me anymore. You still have the biggest church in Detroit. I still know how to get 'em goin'. I do. Clara: Can ijoin you? No. I just wanna talk to ree. Can I do that? Can I just talk to ree? Of course you can. Daddy, daddy, daddy. Of course you can. I'll be right there when you need me. They need leadership, ree. You should see the way these fools are steppin' over Martin's body to be in charge. I don't want no part of that. And these young revolutionaries out here, they don't want no part of what we built. They want to free our people. They all talk. Not all of them. I like Angela Davis. She don't care about public opinion and she's not afraid to speak up to those pigs or anyone else. Yes, pigs. Pigs? You saw what they did to us during the rebellion. Riots. Why shouldn't we fight back? And start a full-on war? You think we can win that? We're tired of gettin' our heads kicked in. Non-violence got us our civil rights and our right to vote. At what price? Our souls? Our dignity? Hmm. I've been thinking. We should hit the road again. Why not? A northern tour. Mm-mm. Me preachin' and you singin'. Just think on it. You don't gotta decide tonight. I'm not doing that, daddy. I know you got your very busy tourin' and recordin' schedule. This won't interfere with that. I won't interfere with that. I'm done with that. I can't go back to headlining with you. You're not walkin' in the spirit anymore. That is not true. You're drinking and you're whoring around. Same as you! You not too old for me to knock you on your ass! You know that, right? Is everything all right? Just mind your own business! I'm talkin' to... Don't talk to her like that. Have you lost your mind? Huh? Maybe. Maybe I found it. Comeon, bts getyoutobed. Just_ Just don't. I heard your conversation. I'm not sorry. No, you ain't got nothin' to be sorry for. Justdo yourthing, ree. And you do it as big and as loud and as long as you can. Please, just listen to it again, okay? I have a great feeling about this song, and the Beatles are getting restless. They said if you don't do it, they will. The song is catholic, Jerry. I'm a baptist. That's crazy. They caught Angela Davis. That can't be right. What? No, no, no. Newsreader: Angela Davis, a young black militant who has been hunted for nearly two months on murder and kidnapping charges, was arrested yesterday at a hotel in midtown Manhattan by agents of the federal bureau of investigation. Angela Davis must go free. Black people will be free. My daddy says I don't know what I'm doing. I respect him, of course, but I have to stick by my beliefs. You have to disturb the peace when you can't get no peace. What the hell is this tour schedule? Half the damn dates are gone! All right, all right, we were just about to have a talk with you about this. We're not having a family barbecue? This is one of these Ken hippie talks? I told you this wasn't gonna work. Just breathe. Put the damn dates back. Don't do it, Cecil. Listen, ree... You work for me, Cecil. You overbook. You don't show up for half the dates, then I have to deal with the fallout. It's your damn job! We're trying to help you. Aretha, you need to slow down. You stop for five minutes, they forget all about you. That's ridiculous. How would you know, erma? You barely have one hit. Ree, you haven't slept in months. And you look like it. You don't want me to tell you what you look like, Carolyn. Well, next time you have a breakdown, don't call us, all right? I won't. Come on, let's go outside. Come on. And don't call me when you need a gig or you want me to write liner notes in yourjive-ass album or introduce you to some producers, or just borrow some cash that your ass never pay back. If I don't work, y'all don't eat. Right. Put the damn dates back, Cecil. Three venues in three states in three days. Happy now? Yes, I am. And don't ever pull that bullshit with me again. I know how to run my damn business. You asked me. Y'all just wanna take my crown. Oh, god. Please. Ree, think about our son. This isn't good for him. Don't tell me I'm a bad mother. Here comes the paranoia. I never said that! Olga, bring miss Franklin a fruitjuice. Don't you dare. What you staring at? Go get my lunch. Yes, ma'am. Tell me y'all don't want what I got. All right, forget it! I can't talk to you when that demon takes hold. You don't know what I go through. Y'all don't know what I've been through! We love you, ree. Why can't you see that, ree? Get the hell out of my house. No, don't move. We're going to deal with this, ree. Out! Out! Out! Come on, baby, please... Ree, listen to me. They're here to help you. Please. It's your family. Teddy! Calf! Come help your momma sing now. To be young gifted, and black oh, what a lovely precious thing Young, gifted, and black oh, what a lovely precious thing say it again. To be young gifted, and black open your heart to what I mean when you're young gifted, and black your soul's intact I'm gonna take the kids back to Detroit with me. I think that's best. What are you thinking right now? Just things. What things? Private things. After all this time, you're still keepin' stuff from me? You don't keep stuff from me? You should. Why? I trust you. Don't you trust me? Sometimes. What do I have to do to make it all the time? Just let me be. I know what to do. Be here with me. Just let your mind go quiet for a moment. That would be easy if you stopped talking. What's wrong? Nothing. I have to make some calls. You don't have to call anyone, ree. You don't know what I have to do. Don't go to that dark place. Come here. Come here. Tell me what's wrong, baby. You're shaking. You act so tough. I can see that little scared girl in you. Shit! I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. It's all right. Shit! She can't do it, Cecil. Put her on the phone. She's asleep right now. Her migraine. Man, who do you think you're bullshittin'? Tell ree, she's gonna get sued again. Ladies and gentlemen, the queen of soul, miss aretha Franklin! Hey, let us help you. Please. I say a little prayer for you moment I wake up before I put on my makeup chorus: Makeup prayer for you combing my hair now wonderin' what dress to wear now wear now say a little prayer for you forever and ever you'll stay in my heart and I will love you forever and ever we never will part oh, how I love you together, forever that's how it must be to live without you only bring heartbreak for me I run for the bus, dear while ridin' I think of us chorus: Us, dear prayer for you And all through my coffee break time Ree?

What y'all wanna sing? And... In the morning... An all-gospel record has a very limited audience. I don't care. You do care. You sat in that office with me six years ago, and you said you wanted to make hits, and I think you still do. I'm making this album, Jerry. All right, can you just hear me out, please? I'm making this album, or I'll never make an album with you again. All I wanna do is drink now, Jerry. Well, let me get you into a program. I'm in a program, but I need the church. I need the spirit. It has always gotten me through, and it will get me through again. Okay. Well, can we just... I mean, just think about this... This album is not for me or for you or anybody else. This album is for god. And you can'tjive god, Jerry, so stop trying. Oh. I'm not trying to jive you orjesus, okay? It's the gospel record. It's 1972, for Christ's sake. Sorry. I... Hey, how about we make a documentary film to go along with the record? So, the international fans, the hippies, the atheists like me can see you in your element and understand the music that made you. You mean for white people? Well, I... All right. Yes. That's a great idea. Okay. Well, good. So, you're not gonna leave me? We're not done yet. Oh, boy. What? I want to produce the album, too. All right. Okay. Okay. Choir: Flood my soul hold! Hold! You have to do something with the longer notes. You're not giving yourself anywhere to go. Start straight, then hit the vibrato halfway through. Tension and release, y'all. Yes, and this song is a lot more deliberate. James: Yeah? Mm. Take it from where we left off. "In the stillness." Choir: In... In the stillness yeah, that's it. Of the midnight oh, lord sacred sacred secrets secrets secrets James: Oh, yes he 'ii unfold Thank you!

Ree, the spirit is the spirit. It moves when it moves. What you want us to do? Behave like episcopalians? Now what's really bothering you? You told me once that music would save my life. I did. What if it doesn't? The demon is strong. Ain't no demon hauntin' you, ree. There never was. Just the pain you've been runnin' from your whole life. But you gotta let it go, ree. Give it to god. It wasn't your fault. And he knows that. I don't know about tomorrow or the concert or the album or the documentary. You in church right now. You're safe. So, ree, let's have church. Daddy. It's good to see you. We were in California, and we heard that you were singing gospel, and... Clara dragged me here. Clara can't make you do anything. She's got pretty feisty since you last saw her. Glad you came. That surprises me, 'cause we haven't been getting on as of late. You told me I wasn't walking in the spirit. I was angry. You were with god. You have always been with god. He was with me. I tried to run from him, but he brought me back. Like Jonah. Like Jonah. You taught me every song I'm singing today. I did my best. But you have exceeded all of my expectations, ree. I'm about to bust wide open, and you're just getting started. I can't imagine what you're gonna do next. Because you can do anything, ree. First, give an honor to god, who's the head of all our lives. Yes. Amen. James: I'm sure you all have noticed the cameras by now. Don't get distracted by it. We here to have church, right?
