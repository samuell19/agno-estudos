For my records, S-A-N-D-Y? No, D-I-E, no Y. I know, I know. It's supposed to be Sandy from the beach or Mr. Sandy-pants, which is what this guy Billy Shaw used to call me in school. Tried to explain to him that Sandy-pants isn't how my name's spelled, that it's spelled Sandy, like pecan Sandie cookies. So then he just started calling me Mr. Pecan Sandies instead. Bill Shaw. Anyway. You seem angry. I seem angry? Oh, I think maybe I'm just a little nervous. That's not what I'm seeing. You're furious. I'm actually quite concerned you may at any moment pick up your chair and hit me in the head with it. Hit you? I-- I don't wanna hate you, Dr. Trabulous. I know. Occasionally, I like to use humor, help put people at ease. Oh. Do you know why I'm here? They said because of what happened. I was asked to come and talk to those of you who were on the seventh floor that afternoon. See how you're holding up. I'm holding up fine. What was your relationship with Kevin Durgan, Gary Shenley, Janice Habor? They were all in personnel, and I'm in tax accounts. I almost never go to the seventh floor. I needed to use the laminator. And someone had put the laminator in the closet, which is, like, two rooms away from the other side of the hall where it all went down. So yeah. I'm here until Friday. Why don't we meet each day this week, talk a little, see if we can't get to the bottom of things? What do you mean? Shock can be a tricky thing. Sandy, sometimes our emotional response to horrific events can get buried, hidden from us at first, only to appear after some time has passed. Oh. OK, but like I said, I think I feel pretty great. Great. I can't believe you said I was gonna hit you with a chair. It's a little bit-- I'm sorry. Oh, it's OK. No biggie. Morning. Good morning. Nice hat, partner. I bought it. Senor Churchill died yesterday. Oh no! what happened to your hamster, Char? I don't know. He's got the worst luck with these pets. Ah! Baby. I know, I know. All right, champ. That's enough. Charlie? Do you wanna be a toothless old man? I think that we should have someone come and look at this. Honey, it's not the best time to be getting a new dishwasher, OK? I didn't say that we had to buy a new one. I was just-- never mind. Hey, old man. Ar, ar, ar, ar. Thank you. It's good, huh? Ready? Give me the last three Lisa Krindel cakes again. In '99 an Andean pink Louis XIV in marzipan. 15. Then a German white cake with a crew finish and cornelli lace. And last year, for her 17th birthday, she went for a gilded gold leaf. How the hell does Safarah Polsky keep guessing right with this kid? Give me that picture. Mhm. Heading to Brown in the fall, 3.55 GPA out of Brearley. Wants to be an actress. Oh, that's right. She any good? Justin. I went to see her in something where she played an Irish woman who falls in love with an English soldier. She was pretty good. Are there any reviews? No, I don't think so. It was a school production, so. The costumes were amazing. All the women had on, like, these really blousy like Emma Thompson-y dresses. Sugar draperies. Maybe. I have to sketch. Justin. MAN (ON TV): I'm sorry, Miss Vera, but it was necessary for us to search your compartment. WOMAN (ON TV): Indeed. And may I ask what you expected to find? MAN (ON TV): A valuable jewel has been stolen. A man has been murdered. They're making a routine search of the entire carriage and asking a few questions. WOMAN (ON TV): Go right ahead. MAN (ON TV): There's been a murder committed. Scotland Yard, Sherlock Holmes? Sherlock Holmes and I-- MAN (ON TV): What about Sherlock Holmes? MAN (ON TV): Cross-examining suspects. MAN (ON TV): Suspects? BOY: Could you repeat-- Nuh-vah-duh. Nevada. Carson City? Carson City is correct. Anita? How we doing? Pretty good. He's 0 for 3 so far, but they just switched to state capitals. MAN: Cal-if-for-nya. California. I have a meeting with McDougal execs for lunch tomorrow. So soon? That's great. Yeah, it's really great. Let's not get ahead of ourselves. MAN: California. - I just said it was a meeting. In GIRL: Sacramento. Sacramento is correct. It's not like they're my dream clients or anything. I know. Whatever happens, we'll be fine. Time for sudden death. Charlie? - Come on, Charlie Brown! - Casey-- Jesus. Hey. Sorry, hi. You must be excited for the end of summer school. Probably as much as some of the kids. Charlie Burbage. Massachusetts. Massachusetts. I know he knows Boston. 10 Seconds, Charlie. 9, 8, 7-- congratulations to Mrs. Palmer's team. [applause] Quite a temper. He's just so hard on himself. MAN: Reminder, next week in the Marmelstein Auditorium, we will be presenting Guys and Dolls by Frank-- Nice to see you both again. Yeah. Hey. Hey. How was work? Fine. How was racquetball? Great. Poppy says hello. That's nice. Saw Doren Krasniy. Hm, what's Doren up to these days? Well, he just got that new jaguar. That must have been distressing for you. You can't imagine the thoughts I was having. I can imagine. So the present's on Thursday, isn't it? You know exactly when the present is, Dan. Hey. What is that? It's that hydrating gel Lester was talking about. It's blue. How do you feel? Until I get this job, it doesn't really matter how I feel. Yeah, well, you're gonna get it this time. And once you take Krindel away from that cunt, Safarah Polsky, that's it. It's all exponential from there. We'll see. Tight. Ritz Plaza, Trump Tower. Now it's about $40 for every 20 minutes. It's these Irish drivers. All the drivers are Irish now. Thank you. He's a goddamn homo. Did you know the world's largest shopping mall is in Minneapolis? No. The Mall of the Americas. I wonder if Vijay has been. I'm sure he must have been there. I rain in to Debbie today. She's auditioning for the new Gillian Leopard's play. Honey, can you turn the faucet all the way off. We need a date night. How long as it been since we made love? I don't know. 22 days. Really? God knows how long since you fucked me. You know I don't like that kind of talk. What are you gonna do about it? Come here. [creaking] What was that? I think it was the bed. Sorry. I thought I heard a knocking. It's been quite a year. It was filled with challenges and dangers, filled with questions. I have implored the governor of this state, we must not respond with panic, sir. I will not permit my constituents to live in fear. So far, unfortunately, it seems like the governor hasn't been listening. OK, any other questions? Yes, Lou. Councilman Blenick, do you foresee a day when corporate fat cats and millionaire gun nuts stop running Washington into the ground so that Democrat people of all religious and creeds can have their say? That's a great question, Lou. That's a great question. What Rhonda and I have been fighting for, you know. Did you guys meet Rhonda? This is my wife Rhonda, OK? Don't be shy. I'm sorry! Must have been a Republican, hm? What the hell is this? Try it. Unit 2 sitting tight. How's your ice cream? Did I tell you who has a great ass? That girl in the supermarket. Blond hair, lovely teeth. What an ass. Oh, gorgeous. Hey! Does this belong to you? What? I asked you whether this belongs to you. Does this belong to you? Satish. Get lost! Fuck you, Apu. Satish, Satish. Come on. I have to say, last night I was thinking a little bit about Kevin Durgan. Oh? I did actually know him a little bit. He knew a guy at Ticketmaster. So one time, I asked him if he could get me some Billy Joel tickets. He couldn't get them. I clearly remember talking to him. What do you think made you remember this Kevin person? He was one of the people you were asking about. Ah yes, Kevin Durgan. He used to wear turtlenecks a lot. I really remember that. Do you have a boyfriend? Or a girlfriend, Sandy? I have a girlfriend. We're actually doing a little temporary separation thing, but yeah, girlfriend. Tell me about the separation? Well, it's been 5 and 1/2 weeks. And it's been hard, but I can't believe I'm actually saying this, it's also been good in a bunch of ways. How so? Well, I feel like I've been sort of getting a chance to get to know myself a little better. That's always rewarding. Yeah, it's great. Sorry, 48 days off sugar, so-- Are you in recovery? Oh, definitely. I was a big time-- I mean, I am a big time sugar addict. You never stop being a sugar addict. So I try to go to meetings everyday and-- That must give you lonely and hopeless feeling, having to go there on a daily basis? I'm not lonely. I've been getting a lot out of my meetings. They've really helped me get through with this stuff with Efrat. Efrat? Is that the little man that lives inside your head? The what? Oh, the joking thing again. It's-- yeah, no. Efrat is the woman I've been living with. Spell it. E-F-R-AT. Efrat. It's Hebrew for something about flowers, or the wind, or something. Windy flower. So we talked a bit on the phone. That's right. We're going to be married 35 years. And we've been thinking that we might want to do something special with some of our friends. OK. Let's have a look. Pretty. And these are? That's part of the Elysium line. Beautiful. And how much are these? It depends. Design, frosting, sugars, and garnishes are all price factors. We begin basically 1,800, standard weight fill and feature start at $14 a slice. Really? And that wouldn't be for anything higher end, like an Elysium. It would be for a blank cake, what we sometimes refer to as a naked pastry. And you don't have something simpler? Vanilla cake with chocolate frosting? Wechsler. You know, I'm realizing we may not be able to help contribute to your upcoming event. I'm really sorry if we've been confusing in any way. Congratulations on your anniversary. It was really nice to meet you. Congratulations. I don't know what happened. Ginny Myers said they had two lots on Little Dix Bay and bids on two more. Come on, Clayton. We're three days away from the biggest high profile present of the season. I'm sorry. You think Safarah Polsky's gonna present a ganache? That's what I'm hearing, opalescent ganache.-- [ringtone plays] Strange. Yes? Ganache. Ginny, what is the deal? Wechsler and Agnes Whitehead? I mean, please. If you wanted to sabotage my career, why don't you just tell me and give me a fighting chance? I gotta go to Kevin's theater think tonight, so we'll conference in the morning. MAN (ON TV): I'm taking you in Lee. We're gonna settle up. [gunshot] [scream] MAN (ON TV): Not a chance. MAN (ON TV): [inaudible] tell the whole truth. MAN (ON TV): Or what? MAN (ON TV): I'm only gonna tell you once more. MAN (ON TV): Wait a minute, Doctor. MAN (ON TV): You put that glass on top of your head. MAN (ON TV): But what are you gonna do then? MAN (ON TV): Just put it up on your head. I'll show you. MAN (ON TV): That's the whole story. All of it. MAN (ON TV): It was in front of me for years, Owen. MAN (ON TV): Come on out, or do I have to come in and get you? You think I should a hair piece? No. Don't be stupid. Disgusting. Hey, Paul Shaffer, Paul Shaffer. Can I help you? I'm here to see Kevin. He'll be out in a minute. Oh, actually, I'm in a little bit of a hurry. I'm Emme Keeler. I just wanna-- I just wanna poke my head in for a second. It's best if people wait out here. Tony, we'd best-- Mr. Kushner, how are you, sir? Hey, Tony. What's your name? Elvis Cedeno. Seh-den-yo. So what happened? - You are so beautiful. - David! All right. It went well. I mean, I think they liked me. they said they're gonna us know tomorrow. Oh my God, that is so great. All right. Don't you get ahead of yourself, OK? Sorry. Sorry. Save it. I hope you get this account. Dr. Lowinger wants Charlie to start coming three times a week. What? I thought he was supposed to be doing better. He is. He's doing a lot better. Everything's helping-- the therapy, the tutoring, the [inaudible], it's all helping. I think he's doing a lot better. No, he is, definitely. He just needs a little more. You're right. Of course. We'll keep doing whatever it takes. I still think you're beautiful. I should check on him. CHARLIE: Knock, knock! ALLISON: What's that smell? CHARLIE: You have to knock! ALLISON: Don't shout. What are you doing at your desk? CHARLIE: None of your business. ALLISON: Charlie. He's been lighting those fucking soldiers on fire again. There's burnt plastic all over his desk. I don't know how many times we have to tell him something. I really don't. Bye, little lady. Hurry, hurry. That's better. Bye-bye. Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang! You got me, partner. Let me see your gun. Let me see your gun. Please, please. Let me hold it! Good morning. Good morning. Let's go to work. TRABULOUS: Are your parents still alive? My parents? Yeah, my dad's retired. My mom's alive. Has your mother been a source of support during your breakup with Efrat? The temporary separation, you mean. Right. Like I said, she's great, and she just wants me to be happy. I mean, she's a royal pain in the neck, but-- Why do you think she smothers you like that? I wouldn't call it smothers. She just loves me a lot and worries sometimes. And when she's worrying and treating you like a little baby, do you sometimes think about hitting her? This is another one of your-- You never felt like giving her a good kick or shoving her hard into the ground? You're serious, aren't you? It's OK if you think you haven't. Well, I haven't. OK, that's fine. I want what's best for you, Sandy. So I'm telling you what I see. What do you think you see? What do you think you see? I see a man beginning to buckle under the weight of his own rage and disappointment. Wow. Either I'm in some serious denial about that, or you're pulling my leg again. I'm sorry. Oh, Jesus! Cut that out. No, I thought for certain you were on to me. I'm starting to think maybe you're the one that needs the therapy here. You're Judy Burman, aren't you? Jerry Binder. We went to Evi Emanuel together, remember? You-- you used to let me copy your homework in human histories. Well, hello. Nice-- nice to see you. I gotta have my chocolate to get me through the day. Yeah, I-- I saw you the other day, and I said "Is that you Judy Burman?" Hillerman now. Of course. Well, you look wonderful. You do remember me, don't you? Of course, Jerry Binder. I don't remember letting you cheat on homework, however. That was a long time ago. Is that yours? I'm a bicycle thief. It's how I make my living. Listen, I was gonna sit down and have some lunch, and if you'd care to join me. Thank you. I've eaten already. Keep me company, then. Well, I may have a minute or two. Great. Chinese, Chinese. Do You know how many Chinese restaurants there are in Manhattan? No. 2,100. How many Italian restaurants do you think there are? More than Chinese or less than Chinese? I think less. Dolores. 2,100 Chinese restaurants. So what? So nothing. It's a lot of restaurants. There's a lot of Chinese! Summertime. So you've been out in Arizona all this time? No, I moved there from South Carolina after Stella died. And before that, we lived in Tampa for years and years. Before that, Europe, Italy. You lived in Italy? Have you been? No. Aw, you should go. [speaking italian] It's never too late. Anyway, now I'm back in Coney Island. I have a beautiful place over by the water, Verrazano Terraces. Of course, very fancy. Are you still drawing those sketches of trees and flowers? No, not really. That's a shame. You were very good. Well, I should be going. - Did I say something wrong? - No, no. I should be going. - Oh. Well, look. It's been a pleasure, and I hope to see you again sometime. Thank you. What was so funny the other day? When? At the meeting. Why we were laughing? I don't know. Something must have struck me. I see. [buzz] Yes? WOMAN (ON PHONE): Emme, that was the Birdhouse. Safarah just arrived. She's sitting by the window in the third dining room. Right. Can you just do that like a normal person? Safarah, Hi. Emme Keeler. I thought this was my favorite cucina. Would you join me? No, I don't wanna interrupt. Isabel has to run. You can keep me company. No problem. Maybe I can just get the waiter to wrap this up. Hm? Nothing. I didn't see you. I was eating with Royston. I didn't even see Royston. We were in the back. Ah. So will you have some of this? I will never finish. No, no. I just wanted to say hello. Hello, Emme. Hello, Safarah. Oh, I've been wanting to call you, actually, to task about Portofino. Oh, when are you going? At the end of September. Oh, that's fabulous. You will have the entire town to yourselves. Are you staying at the Splendido? No, no. At the Nationale. Must be in the downtown area somewhere. So Danny's still running around playing tennis all day long? Racquetball No, not really. He's consulting at Williams and Hilliard. Oh, I didn't know that was for sure. - It's just about for sure. - That's wonderful. Congratulate him. Well, but you know who I ran into the other day? Gladys Phelps. Oh no. Is she still making those ridiculous celebrity cakes? Jude Law is her big seller right now. Oh yes, I'm sure he is. She's gonna be at the Krindels' tomorrow. Mhm. I heard you're presenting a ganache. You're being very dramatic today, Emme. It's giving me goosebumps. I know. What a business. After everything that's happened, I cannot believe that nothing has changed, you know? Yeah. Yeah, I know. Do you ever think of doing something else? Do you? I've always wanted to study penguins. Penguins? You know, I actually went to Antarctica four years ago to watch them migrate? Did I ever tell you about that? No. Well, it's amazing, really. Yes, every spring the ice melts, and these penguins, they try to make it over to dry land so that they can breed. They have to ride these huge waves to make it up to the cliff ledges. But there are thousands and thousands of birds that and there are only so many spaces. So after a while, most of them just get tired and drown. And the walruses, they just wait for them at the bottom of the rocks. That sounds like a depressing field of study. Yes, it does, doesn't it? So what do you think about a ganache? I think it's the perfect time of the year for white chocolate. Well, we shall see. Yes. [beeping] Hey, officer, officer, officer, please. I'm going inside. Just be a minute. That's about all it will take me to finish this ticket. Come on, officer. I have a [inaudible] very important to pick up for the boss. Well, I'm sure you do. Are you here for General Ganjee. - Yes. - One moment. They were hiding behind some couch cushions in the back. And that's the history of the bikini. It looks like your friend's coming, so why don't you hop in there and get that vehicle out of here? - Thank you. I was just gonna do that, officer. Bye, Avi. Bye-bye, Shirley. Lovely talking to you. - Come on. Let's go. - Got her down to $40. - Yeah, let's go. - Got the specs? Yes, I got the specs. Let's go! Do you have a cigarette? No, I quit. Hey, how was your audition? I got it. Congratulations, Deb! That's amazing. Thanks. You jerk. When were you gonna tell me? I'm sorry. It was just such a great part for you. Oh, please. There'll be plenty of others. David and I were just talking about me auditioning again. I hope so, Al. We've really needed the extra insurance lately for Charlie, so it turns out that my teaching's been a really good thing. How-- how is Charlie? He's all right. Actually, he's been kind of a pain in the ass lately. Well, it looks like you lost a little weight. That's what David was saying. I don't know where that comes from. David and I have always been thin. Well, sometimes it just happens. I don't know. I shouldn't have said he was a pain in the ass. That's terrible. No, it's not. It's-- it's a difficult age. I can't believe that none of these mothers smoke. What is going on over there? Shit. Charlie! Charlie, what are you doing? What did we say about hitting? No hitting. That's right. No hitting! My lightsaber! MAN (ON TV): Dynamite? So no smoking, or open fires, or radio transmission within 100 feet. MAN (ON TV): A goat full of dynamite? MAN (ON TV): Mhm, and lots of it. He has always had a good appetite. MAN (ON TV): Safest thing's just not jostling him. [inaudible] MAN (ON TV): Well, one wrong move and everything goes blooey. MAN (ON TV): Is there anything more we can do? WOMAN (ON TV): Anything, anything at all? MAN (ON TV): Well, to prevent any chain reaction, we could stop our blasts. WOMAN (ON TV): Eating dynamite. MAN (ON TV): Now, ain't that the way it always is? First time he comes up town he figures he's got to do everything. - Hey. - You have to knock! You can't-- What did we say about hitting? No hitting. That's right! No hitting. You better watch it, Mister. Because someday, somebody bigger might decide they wanna hit you. Now, would you like that? CHARLIE: Yes. DAVID: All right, darling. I am not angry. Please stop crying. That went great. - So tell me what happened. - We didn't get it. That's what happened. Did they say why? No. They didn't say. I don't know. [sobbing] Charlie, stop crying! I can't believe it. I just cannot believe it. [sobbing] Charlie, shut up, shut up, shut up! [wheezing] Honey, do you have your inhaler? Shit. Sweetheart, where's your inhaler? Where's your inhaler? Charlie, it's OK. Where is your-- Where is it? Is it in your bag? Are there extras in the bathroom? I don't know. Did you find it? No, I can't find it. [wheezing] DAVID: Got it. OK, here we go. Here you go, baby. Here we go. Here we go. We have it right here. Take a breath. Slow. Slow. One more, one more. It's OK. That's it. We're right here. We're right here. OK, OK. Quiet. Don't. Please, don't hurt me, Gorgon. You can cry, but I'll still kill you. I'll slash you with my venom claws. Oh no, not the venom claws. That's right. The poisonous venom claw! Let me go. I promise I won't tell anyone about your real identity. I don't care that you're crying. I will open up your neck and make you pay for your foolish mistake! Now I will take you to my lair and chop you up and then eat you. WOMAN (ON PA): Nurse Rose, please report to room 406 immediately. Judy, oh thank God For you. Thank you. Think It's a little stuffy? Oh, you wanna go for a walk? No. Sit. How are you, dearest? How is Henry? Fine. Henry's the same. Henry is the same? Sorry to hear that. [laughter] And Rachel is well. They're still happy being way out in California? I spoke to her this morning. Andrew just had his 11th birthday. Didn't he just have a birthday? Everything's just racing by. How's Henry? Henry is fine. I was listening to the radio this morning. And General Eisenhower said that he thinks the war is almost over. I wonder if that means my Oscar will be coming home soon. I hope so. I hope so. Sorry. Hey, hello. Hi. Hi. How are you today? Good. And you? Not bad, not bad. Sorry. Oh. Here. If I could just-- You made it out alive. Barely. What's he, a wacko? You seem nervous. I'm not. Good. Your folks still live in Connecticut? Yeah. Do they come to visit you often? I mostly drive up to see them. They don't really care for the city and all the crowds. Especially my dad. What makes your father so intolerant of the people who live here? I didn't say that. I never said intolerant. All right. Have you talked with your father about what you've been going through with Efrat? Yeah, I've actually tried hard to keep my folks out of that. You mentioned she was Jewish? So? And your father being an intolerant bigot-- I just said he is not intolerant. I'm sorry. I thought that's what I was picking up. He and Efrat got along great. Get along. Get along great. During the six months that you've been broken up-- It's only been 5 and 1/2 weeks, Dr. Trabulous. During this time, have you had any sexual contact with one another? No, but we agreed that we shouldn't, Doctor, OK? And that's turned out to be really beneficial, in the sense that we haven't allowed sex to obscure our attempts at healing. How has Efrat fraud herself frustrated these attempts at healing? Efrat herself? She's been a bit breezy with your feeling. Breezy? Insipid, unconcerned. Geez Louise, you keep saying these things. Efrat says things-- Don't say that! Sorry. You seem nervous. I'm just excited. What are you excited about? I don't know. Something. Definitely something. That does sound exciting. [knocking on door] Hi. Hey, what are you doing here? Chocolate delivery. I was in the neighborhood. That's great. Come on in. Sir, sir, sir, step back. Step back. Thank you, ma'am. I am so sorry to keep you waiting. I-- I had to sit in on a play rehearsal. The director is from Greenwich Village, and I like to keep an eye on it. I don't want Guys and Dolls turning into Oh Calcutta or something. Uh, you want some coffee? No. No, thanks. How about some tea, orange pekoe? I could have Emily heat up some water. No, thanks. So here we are again, I am sad to say. Duff you remember Emme Keeler. Priscilla, hi. Lisa had to step out for just a moment. OK, no, problem. Hi. Got something yellow for us again this year? Something yellow? He's confusing you with someone else. I'm talking about the yellow one with the things on it. That was Safarah Polsky. She was here earlier. Remember? With the ganache we loved. I don't know that, goddamn it. I don't know who all these people are supposed to be. Go sit down. That's it. Here she is. Hi. Sorry, I had pee. That's attractive. So you're ready? Yeah, I'm gonna let you two alone. Holler if you need me. I'll be out here with Prince Charming. OK. So, Clayton, you remember the birthday girl. Hi, Lisa. Can you introduce her to the rest of the gang, please? Sounds good. Of course you know Emme. This is Alexa. LISA: Hello. This is Justin. Hello. And I'm Clayton, your cruise director. Actually, I think I'm the director, right? OK? Can we show Lisa the first sketch, please? With pleasure. No, you're the captain. Right. I'm the captain, right. OK, let's get started. You know, Vijay was really funny last night. What a character. Disgusting. Oh, come on. Hey, back up! Sir, it will help us greatly if we can keep this area clear. We'll be done soon. In other words, back up! Thank you. An idiot. Near Woodstock. It's supposed to be very peaceful. Smell that? What? Fall's coming. Isn't this lovely? Beautiful. I knew you'd like it. It's Italian. Very nice. Oh, listen, thanks again for the chocolate, Judy. That was very thoughtful. You're welcome. I could just sit here all day and watch the waves come and go. [humming] PRINCIPAL PEERSAL: This is a disciplinary report that was filed this morning by-- by Mr. Jeffers. "Friday 9:41 AM, my second period class was suddenly interrupted by some screaming coming from the playground. Charlie Burbage had pinned Hector Garnikian to the ground, and was forcing dirt and gravel into his mouth while calling him a sand monkey. With the help of Mr. Talbot, I subdued and separated the boys from one another. At this point, I was able to observe that Garnikian was bleeding profusely from his chest, neck, and head, residing in a semi-conscious condition. Mr. Burbage, in contrast, seemed to the suffering no ill effects as a result of the exchange. He did, however, refuse to curtail his sand monkey characterizations, even under my explicit request for him to do so. Sincerely and for your immediate consideration, Professor Jonathan Jeffers." I keep telling him he's not a real professor, but-- "Sand monkey?" It's a racial slur. Hector Garnikian is an Armenian-American. Oh my God. I don't understand. Why does this keep happening? How is he? He's gonna be OK, just a few stitches and an IV. How's Charlie? Charlie? On, he's in detention. So this is Juliet. Juliet. Yeah, we named this series after Shakespeare's women. It's-- it's kind of a joke, but-- OK, this is Viola, which is one of my favorites. It's actually meant to look like majolica. It's got something baroque about it, but I like the drama in it, you know. [phone ringing] Hey. No, nothing. No, I'm just looking at cakes. Some are OK, I guess. No, I'm not going. Because I was talking to her, and then these guys come over and she starts flirting with them, and she wouldn't even let me finish what I was saying. I don't know. Just some guys. I wasn't flirting with them. She was. Why, are you jealous? You guys can keep going if you want. No. Shut up! I cannot wait to talk to her about this. I just would never-- I just would never think that. Wait, wait, wait a minute. What's that one? That's the Rosalind. It looks like it's moving. Yeah, it does. It's really beautiful. Thank you. And it's easy on the hips. What do you mean? Well-- Because the Rosalind is a very low density cake, we don't have to use a lot of processed sugars to support the design. Oh, OK. That just basically means it's less fattening. All right. Keep going. Sorry. Well, the cake people are here. What do you want me to do, ignore them? Well-- It's the Ophelia. LISA: I'm listening to you. What? I know. Well, I am gonna say something to her, so you're just gonna have to deal with it. All right. All right. I'll say I found out. The Helena. So what happens now? He's suspended? Well, one of the reasons that Charlie was in summer school to begin with was because he had missed so many days of the regular school year because of suspension. I know. I'm the one who pays these tuition checks, remember? David. It's actually been the last two or three years that have been frustrating. Six suspensions in 27 months. Well, at least he's consistent. I think we can say that much is true. It's getting so you can set your watch by him. That wouldn't be a bad idea. See if he can take a licking and keep on ticking. I'm sorry, but you're making jokes about wristwatches while our son is-- is lost in-- You're right, you're right. I'm sorry. It's not funny. I don't think this is about blaming or finding fault. It's just-- it's difficult. I mean, you don't blame anyone, do you? Well, I certainly don't blame either one of you. - Oh, God! - What? What happened? Something just rubbed up against me. Something just-- - What? Just rubbed my leg. Your bag? Sorry. How are you two holding up? We're holding up fine. Yeah, yeah. We're fine. We're both just-- Tired. We're tired. Of course. You must be exhausted. We all are. Today, and tomorrow, and every day, I'm quite certain, people from every corner of the earth look into their mind's eye and contemplate this very spot. A billion eyes peering over distant horizons, taking note of your great city. And under the shadow of those eyes, and the shade of your teeming boulevards, I have often felt myself to be walking through the very center of the world. Big dog is on the move. Step back please, everybody. Step back. Please step back. Step back please. Stay back. I'm telling you, stay back! I don't know! Life is very short, my friend. We should all know that by now. I feel like we're living with a stranger. Well, he's our son, Al. He's not a stranger. I found a book in his room yesterday. It-- it was a book about how to trap and skin animals. It was all instructions and diagrams. Must have been a schoolbook. Maybe it's time for a change of scenery. What do you mean? Take a break, get some time for yourselves. We're not in the position to be taking a vacation right now. I was thinking more about Charlie. You mean like send him to camp or something? Well, what I was thinking about would be a little different than camp. What are you thinking? Look, you seem like a very nice couple who are having a hard time. I'm just trying to think of ways to make things easier. Where would he go? He would go away. I think I'm confused here. So am I. Just a suggestion. Yeah, well, I don't know exactly what it is you're suggesting, but I don't think I like the sound of it. - That's fine. Perhaps some more suspensions will solve it. He's-- he's just going through a rough time right now. I mean, he's gotten a bit spoiled, but if that's anyone's fault, it's ours. OK? I mean, deep down, he's a good kid. He's actually a great kid. He's actually a selfish, incorrigible monster with a heart made out of shit and splinters. What? What was that? What the hell did you just say? Let's go, Allison. You are in serious trouble, buddy. Allison, let's go. Unbelievable. I'm so sorry, Em. It felt like a selling point. And who knows, you know? I mean, maybe she'll just look back and she'll think, I want the cake that's the lightest, you know? I want the one that's the least calories. No, what she'll do is she'll associate that cake in particular and our company in general with her thinking that she's fat. But I was saying just the opposite. What a business. Get out. - What? - Get out of the car. You're fired. You know, maybe it's things like this that keep you from winning the big-- Shut the fuck up and get out of the fucking car, you fucking faggot, you fucking cliche! I'm sorry. Please, not at all. [ringtone playing] Yes. Oh, hi. Ah-hah. OK, great. I'll tell her. We got it. What? We got her cake. That was Priscilla Krindel. Lisa wants the Rosalind! Oh my God. Should we maybe go back for him? Levin. Oh, that was his name, Levin. Can you believe it? I know a golf pro in Tempe whose name's Nostril. - You're teasing. - It's true. Allen Nostril. Ask Lainie. She'll vouch for me. Well, I might just-- WOMAN: Hello. Speak of the devil. Out here. Hi! Lainie, this is Judy Burman. I mean, sorry. Judy Hillerman. Hello. Hi, honey. So you knew this big lug all the way back in high school? What was he like? Awful? Yes. I'll bet he was. She doesn't believe me about Allen. Allen Nostril, that's really his name. We used to play pinochle. Oh, you're playing my record. Isn't it beautiful? Remember, we have to be in Manhattan in 50 minutes. I'll be right back. I can't believe it. I just-- I can't believe it. They're really gone. It's so damn fragile. Well, sorry about that. I guess it's all finally hitting me. The shock's wearing off, just like you said it would. This-- this is what you were talking about, isn't it, Dr. Trabulous? Almost, Sandy, almost. Well, what are you doing? I'm trying to help you, Sandy. You are. Then all those things you said about my mom and dad, Efrat, and the man that lives inside my head? Go on. You really think that's true? That deep down, I really am angry and sad and all that? Yes. Then that means you really-- do you think I wanna hit you with the chair? Yes. I do. I think you might be right. I'm so sorry. No, you've been a great help to me. I'm glad. I think this driver's gone kind of a weird way. God, I really hope Doren Krasniy's there tonight. What is this, a Valentino? Yeah. Very hot. Thanks. How do you feel? Come on. You must feel fucking hot. I am-- I don't think it's hit me yet. God, this air is incredible tonight, isn't it? Honey, are you sure you don't want some mustard? God. This is what I hate about linen. It's ridiculous. God. Hi. Emme, Dan, oh my God. I can't believe you showed up. What's wrong? You don't know? No, what happened? Safarah Polsky committed suicide this afternoon. What? She hanged herself in her apartment. What? It was on Live at 5:00. I was thinking that you had seen it already. Jesus Christ. I can't-- I can't believe it. Can I use your bathroom? Of course. Thanks. [inaudible] Hey, how are you? Can I see some ID, please? Sure. Yes. We saw it together. Yeah, we loved it. You loved it. I don't like it. You don't like Laurence Fishburne? He's arrogant and he talks very slowly. I did it with her, you know? Dolores, that girl from the supermarket. Yeah? You know, I went to the supermarket to buy some waffles for the kids. And then she had a break, so she asked me if I would come with her to the back of the store and smoke a cigarette. She's really funny, you know? Really funny. I've never done that before, never. I've never cheated on Sucheta. I've never been with another woman except Sucheta. But she was great. She-- she-- she had a great sense of humor. This is it. Sorry. Here, go on. You're sure? Yeah, go. I'll be right there. OK. But never again. Absolutely never again. I forgot to bring back the waffles. WOMAN: Hey, kids, it's time for the pony ride! (SINGING): Your love is better than ice cream, better than anything else that I've tried. Your love is better than ice cream. Everyone here knows how to fight. It's a long way down. It's a long way down. It's a long way down to the place where we started from. Doo-doo-do-doo. It's under the sink. I love this muscle. Did it just get chilly in here? You want a blanket? Please. DAVID: Red one OK? ALLISON: Red one's perfect. You know, maybe we should go and see that new one of his. Hm? That new Laurence Fishburne film. So let's go and see that film. What do you say? OK? WOMAN (ON TV): And that's just one of the things that has changed for so many of us. MAN (ON TV): Thank you for that, Nora. Norman McDonald reporting in front of engine company 44 in Crown Heights. And so I'm looking at the clock here on the studio wall, and seeing that we are coming up on that fateful hour, 8:46 AM, Eastern Standard Time. It may not escape many of you watching at home, but it's a clear and beautiful September morning in New York City, just as it was one year ago. Thanks, Reza. Thanks. Good morning. [bells ringing] Sir, Mister, are you all right? Hey. Hey. What? Are you OK? I think I'm lost. [MUSIC - THE WRENS, "THIS IS NOT WHAT YOU HAD PLANNED"] [MUSIC - NEIL FINN, "DRIVING ME MAD"]
