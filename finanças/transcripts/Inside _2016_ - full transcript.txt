So what are we gonna name her? I don't know. How about Zoey? - Really? - Yeah. - No, I don't think so. - It's sweet. - Why not? - It starts with a Z... ...she'll always be last in the class. Um... - ...Beatrice. - What? - Hey, I had an Aunt Bea, be nice. - An aunt? - Yeah. - Come on, are you kidding me? How about... how about Anna? - Anna? - Yeah? - No. That's just not... - No? - She just kicked... feel it. - What? See how her heart's beating? She's just perfect, Sarah. Except for some internal scrapes, all is well. - I'm more worried about you. - No, uh... it's okay. I'm ready. Okay. Have you started to feel any contractions? No, I don't think so. Is... is that bad? Unusual... it's getting late. - We can wait a couple of days, but... - Thank you. ...if nothing happens in that amount of time... No, no, I... I don't want to be cut open. I want to do this myself. Relax. We'll try inducing it. We'll give you some oxytocin. It's a hormone that accelerates the contractions. What it does is it tells the baby it's time to come out. Is there anybody that can give you a ride in? It'd be better if you didn't drive. - I don't drive anymore. - Oh, I'm sorry. No, it's okay. My mom arrives tonight, so... Good. Well, get as much rest as you can. Merry Christmas. And this carol brings our program to an end... ...on what is the warmest Christmas that I remember. Don't forget, we'll be back with you tomorrow at the same time... ...from 4:00 pm until 8:00. First time anybody ever asked me to take them out to this neighborhood. - It's new. - Sunshine Grove. Who comes up with these names? All sound the same to me. I took some guy from a bank out to some residential, neighborhood last week ...way up northeast, Green Sunshine. Hi, Mum. I was at the doctor's office, I had it on silent and I forgot. Uh... ...yes, I'm fine. I'm just... tired. Okay. I will leave, uh... a key in the mailbox by the garden gate for you. All right, yes, I am sure that I'm okay, I promise. I'm doing everything that I'm supposed to do per doctor's orders... ...so you don't have to worry, okay? Bye, Mum. Hi! Hi! Did you miss me? Did you miss me? Isaac, it's perfect, thank you. - You know you didn't have to do this. - It's just a little something... ...so that when you wake up every hour with the baby crying... ...you'll think of us. - I have something for you, too. - Oh, great! Oh, Sarah, it's... beautiful. Matt took it the day that we met you. I found it while I was going through some of his things and... ...we'd always wanted you and Brian to have it. Brian's gonna love it. I remember this day. Good God! - Thank you. - Yeah. Ah! What are you doing? And now, whenever Brian calls me, this picture shows up. Excuse me. Hello? No. No, he's not... ...no, he didn't... ...he's just not coming back... ever. Thank you. Matt's name is still on the phone line... ...so sometimes companies call and ask for him... ...to try to get him to switch service providers. - I'm sorry. - No, it's okay. Part of me almost likes it when people call and ask for him. It's nice to hear his name, even if only for a second. Isaac... ...I've decided to sell the house. I just... I think it's best with everything that's going on and the baby. I think it's better if I go and stay with my mum for a while. I don't know. I don't think I'm capable of doing this by myself. - I don't have the strength. - We're here for you, whatever you need. I know, but it's not that. Isaac, I'm scared. I'm scared that I won't know what to do. I'm scared that I'm going to be a bad mother and I'm... ...all alone. Sarah, nobody teaches you to be a good mother. Either you've got it or you don't, and believe me, you have got it. Sorry. Don't be alarmed, I was bound to cry. Hey, you know you're invited to have dinner with us tonight. This neighborhood becomes a ghost town on nights like this. I'd love to have you. Please. Thank you. And I am so grateful for you and Brian... ...and how you've been there for me... ...but tonight... ...I don't feel much like celebrating. You like it underwater, too, don't you? Excalibur, what did you do? Okay, that's enough. Hello? Isaac, is that you? I can see you. Sorry to bother you on Christmas Eve. I have a problem with my car, I need to make a phone call. I'm sorry, I don't quite understand. I need to make a phone call. Don't you have a cell phone you could use? The battery ran out. What happened? Like I said, I have a problem with my car... ...please, could you open the door? You know what, my, uh... my husband is sleeping... ...I don't want to wake him. I won't make any noise. It would just take a minute. Please! You know, I think it's best if you just try next door. There's nobody in. Please, it will just take a second. No. No, I'm sorry, I just told you my husband is asleep. I'm not opening the door. Why are you lying? Excuse me? Your husband isn't sleeping, Sarah. He's dead. Open the door, Sarah! Look, I don't know who you are and I don't know what you want. But you better leave, I'm calling the police right now. Do you hear me? Where did she go? Excalibur? What are you barking at, boy? Yes, hi, um, my name is Sarah Clark. I live in Sunshine Grove, number 10 Oak Crest. I would like to report a strange woman lurking outside my house. No, I don't know who she is. I've never seen her before. Please, can you come quickly? I'm inside. Okay, I will. Thank you. Isaac, it's Sarah, um... something's wrong. A strange woman just came to the house and she wanted to come inside. I've never seen her before. I've called the police. They're on their way, but call me back, okay? - Good evening, ma'am. - Hi. - Ma'am. - Sarah Clark? - Yes. - We received a call. It was me. Um... there was a strange woman here. She wanted to come inside the house. - Inside the house? - Yes, she was banging on the door. I don't know what she wanted. Anybody else at home with you, ma'am? No. Any idea who that woman was? No, sorry, I didn't get a good look at her. You see, the light is broken. Well, it... it wasn't working when she was here. I'm gonna take a look out back. You're sure it was a woman? I mean, you got to see her face properly? Any other detail? No, I didn't get to see her face. It was too dark. But I heard her voice, it was definitely a woman. It's clean, there's nobody out there. Whoever it was, is gone. Well, don't worry, ma'am. I don't think she will come back. It's probably someone who had too much to drink. Anyway, I will inform the neighborhood patrol car... ...and get them to drive by later on and make sure everything is okay. Well, thank you, then, um, I'll walk you out. What do you think you're doing? You know you're not allowed in the bed. Come on, get down. Come on! Come on! Yeah, there you go. You too, mister. Who are you? What do you want? Sarah! You should know who I am, Sarah. And what I'm looking for. No, no, no. No. What... what do you want? Sarah. If you come out now, everything will be so much easier. Don't complicate things, Sarah. You can't live in there forever, Sarah. You'll have to come out sooner or later. And so will the baby. That's her coming out, Sarah. Sarah! Sarah! Sarah! Sarah, let's do this together, Sarah! Sarah! Open the goddamn door, Sarah! Sarah! Sarah! Sarah! Sarah? Isaac. I'm Sarah's mother. She's told me so much about you. Oh, I'm so sorry to walk in on you like this. She gave us the keys, just in case. Is she okay? She called, but we weren't able to get to the phone on time. - She's exhausted, the poor thing. - Oh... ...it has been so tough on her. But she is tough. - She'll pull through. - Yes, she will. And I told her that very thing just this afternoon. But then of course, we got the message on my cell... ...saying something about somebody wanting to get into the house. Of course, we were worried... ...worried little neighbors. Brian and me. I'm assuming Sarah mentioned him to you, maybe not. Yes, she did. I... How silly of me, I'm sorry. Thank you so much for coming by, really. It was nothing, she was just jumpy. - It's been a difficult few months for her. - Oh, I know. But we are just so happy... ...to have a little new neighbor on the way. It'll certainly cheer things up around here. Yes. It's a shame she's giving it up for adoption. Oh, she didn't tell you? - I'm so sorry. - No, she mentioned it. I just didn't know she had decided. - Mm. - Well... It's very kind of you to drop in, really. I'll tell her that you called on her, and can I walk you out? Well, we won't bother you any longer. And you live... Right next door. And sorry again for barging in like I did. Who... Who are you? Did something happen to Sarah? Maybe you should tell us who you are first. I'm her mother. Is something the matter? Sarah? Sarah is sleeping. Sarah! Sarah! Sarah! No. I didn't... I didn't know it was you. I didn't... Mum, I... Mum, Mum, no! No, no, no! Mum, no! No, no, no, no! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! I didn't know it was you! I didn't know it was you! I didn't know it was you! I di... I didn't know! Oh, my God! Don't leave me, please. Don't leave me, please. I love you so much! I love you so much! Please! Stay with me! Please, please! Please, Mum, please! Oh, I didn't know it was you! I didn't know it was you! I didn't know it was you! I don't... I didn't know it was you! Isaac. I... I didn't know it was my mum. I thought it was a woman attacking me. I didn't... I didn't know it was my mum. She wants to come out, Sarah. You can't do this by yourself, Sarah. - Let me help you. - Please, not yet. Please, not yet. I said... ...let... me... ...help... you! You can't move? Help! Help! I need help, please! Brian! Brian! Brian, please! Brian! Brian! Brian! Brian! Brian! I need... I need help, please! Brian! No! No, no, no! Brian! Brian, no! Brian! Brian, please! No! Brian, behind you! Behind you! All right. Okay. Okay, got it. Oh, hey, it's Christmas Eve, I think you should go. - Christmas Eve? - Come on, you're just a rookie. Surely dealing with hysterical women it's gonna be part of your duties. Please, tell me you didn't say what I think you just said. - Seriously? - Seriously? - Merry Christmas! - Merry Christmas! Sarah Clark? Uh... I saw the car light. That's okay, ma'am. We just drove by to make sure you were okay. The precinct told us that somebody'd been bothering you. I haven't had any problems. I got scared, I suppose. Sure. - Thank you for coming. - No problem, ma'am, just doing my duty. Well, don't hesitate to pick up the phone if you notice anything strange, okay? - Good night, ma'am. - Good night. Merry Christmas. - Ah, we're done. - Shit! You got me thinking she'd gone into labor and you were playing midwife back there. What is it? What? - Damn it! - What? Hold on. - What is... - Just one more thing. - I was just wondering about its name. - The what? The baby. - Help! - Sarah Clark? Yes! Mike? Do you read me? Mike? Hello? Mike? Hello? Mike? Shit! Oh! Mike! Mike! Please, Mike! See what you've gone and done? Donovan here. We have a wounded police officer. I need back-up. Donovan here, I repeat, we have an injured officer here. - Hello? - Do you read me? - Freeze! Don't move! - No, no, no, it's not me that you want. - Put your hands in the air and don't move! - I'm Sarah Clark. - I called the police earlier tonight. - Okay. The woman that I reported is upstairs. - We need to leave. - What are you talking about? I don't know who she is. She's crazy. She wants my baby, can't you see I'm... - That's enough. That's enough. - I'm pregnant... We're going upstairs. Go! Go on! Go! The woman... where is she? There. She was just there, on the bed. I... hit her with... No, this can't be possible. This isn't happening. Please, you have to believe me. Please. Plea... My water just broke. I need to get to the hospital. Okay, okay, relax. Every... She did this. She must be downstairs. Do you believe me now? Do you believe me now? Wait here. Don't you move now. I'm going down to take a look. Do not leave me here alone! I'll get some help and an ambulance. Okay? Who's there? No. No. No. Oh, Excalibur. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. This baby is coming with me, Sarah... ...one way or another. You get to choose how. Let me help you. I know what I have to do. Just leave it to me. Please, don't. No, no! Hello? Hello, is there anybody there? Hello? - 336, receiving you. - Hello, I'm Sarah Clark. I called earlier from #10 Oak Crest. I need help now! I'm being attacked! Lady, you're talking from a patrol car, where are the police officers? No, I don't know, I think she killed them! I don't know. - You just need to get here now! Please! - Are you the lady who called? Yes! Yes, I'm Sarah Clark. I'm the one that called earlier. I'm under attack. You shouldn't be driving, Sarah. You know what happened to you last time. No! Hello? Hello? Hello? Please! Is there anybody here? I need your help. Hello? Not many people know this, but... ...babies hear everything when they're inside. And music helps them with things... ...they get used to it. And they learn to be happy. That's why I always played it for her whenever I could. Always. She'll be happy here. I couldn't let anything happen to either of you. I know you're in there, Sarah. Sarah! She's mine, Sarah. Don't come any closer. What are you doing? I said don't come any closer. Can't you see you can barely walk on your own two feet? I'll do it. I swear to you, I will do it. You won't. You love her, Sarah. You love her after all. Now you'll do exactly as I say. What were you hoping to achieve with all this? Buy some time. Oh, yes! Oh, yes! Oh, yes! Hello! Can you hear me? Hey! Hey! Help me! Come on! Why? Why me? Because you took mine, Sarah. - What? - You took mine. It's only fair you give her back to me. You? Oh, my God. - Fair's fair, Sarah. - It was an accident. It was no accident. Matt and I just got back from seeing the doctor. I felt the baby kick for the first time, I was so happy. I got distracted for... for a second. I didn't... I didn't know what would happen. I didn't know what was gonna happen. I didn't know! - Please! - I'm sorry. - This is gonna hurt. - No, no, no. What... what are you going to name her? - What? - Her name. Her name. Matt and I never got to choose a name. I want to know what you chose. Isabella. Shitty name!
