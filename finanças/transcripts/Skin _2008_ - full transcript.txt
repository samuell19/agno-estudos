- Come on, ma. - Let's do it. - Sandra. Sandra laing? Hugh johnston, "world network news." Could we ask some questions? Sandra. Sandra. Can I get your autograph? - Sorry. - Look, mama! - I've got a secret. - Is it a good secret? - Yes, very. - Tell me. - I packed Melinda for you. - Are you ready, my angel? - Dear god, make this journey safe. We put our beautiful children, Leon and Sandra, in your care, and know that you will bless them. Amen. - Bye, thembi! - Bye, Sandra. - There once was a girl who lived in a shop, who'd only eat her mismatched socks. Until one day, along came a lion, and gobbled her up in just two hops. Windows up. Okay, Sandra. - Have a good time, Leon. Look after your sister. Off you go. Come on, my love. - Bye, son. - Good afternoon. Hello, Mrs. Joubert. What a lovely dress. Sandra laing. - What's the name again? - Laing. I'm Leon's mother. There. Bed number 4. Thank you. - Ma? Why are they all staring? - You're new here, my sweet. They're just curious. - Excuse me. What is... Now, what shall we do... With Melinda? Sandra. Do you want her on the bed like home, or shall we put her on the table? - Bed, please, ma. - So, it's done. - Any problems? - No. - Sandra. I'm elize. - What do you want? - I'm from Swaziland. That's another country. - I know that. I'm not stupid. - All my friends have always been black. - I'm not black. On that Jesus reached out his hand, touched him and said, "I want you to be clean." And immediately he was cleansed of his leprosy. Close your eyes. For what we are about to receive, lord, make us truly grateful. Amen. - What happened? Tell me! - I told Annie you weren't black, and she hit me. Now, in the early days, our country was vast plains. And on these plains were wild animals and savage natives who were always trying to take our land. There were many wars between them. Why do you think that was, students? Dawie, ja? - Because they were kaffirs, mevrou. - That's a bad word, dawie? We don't use that language in the classroom. Annie. Yes. - They couldn't live together because they were different. - That's right, Annie! Good! Good, good. Because they were... Different. Different. Even today, we learn that everything about the bantu is... Different. What sort of jobs do they do? - They work in the mielie fields, mevrou. - That's right! - And in the mines. - And in the mines. - My father says he doesn't let them drive the tractors because they have monkey hands like Sandra. Look. What does this say? Meneer laing, a piece of paper is not going to reassure all the parents who call me every day to complain that there's a black child at this school. Sandra is a disruption. You are a servant of the state, and the state requires you to look after my child. You must simply do your job, meneer. - My job is to look after all the children at this school. Sandra does not belong here. - It's true. Sandra's special. A brave, intelligent, and a wonderful child. Try getting to know her. You'll see. What do I always say to you? - Never give up. Never give up! Look after your sister, Leon. Love to mama! - Hello, my child. - And how are you, ma'am? Any bargains today? - Special offer on butter. - Never a special on ice-cream. - Anything else for you, Joseph? - That's everything I need, Mrs. Laing. - Am I made of money? - Hey, Mrs. Laing. I need a new wife. This one -- she's too expensive. - Be patient my brother, she's young. - In good time. - Why do you talk to them? Just sell to them. That's all you have to do. - What did they say? - I made sure they heard what ihad to say. She'll settle in. Leon was the same. It takes time. 45. - Am I sick? - Sandra... Sevens, please. Begin. - 7 times 1 equals 7. 7 times 2... - Louder. - 7 times 1 equals 7. 7 times 2 equals-- - louder! - 7 times 1 equals 7. 7 times 2 equals 14. - I said louder! Now begin again! - Why are you hitting me?! - Give me that! Now stand still! That's disgusting. - What did I do wrong? -Ask your parents. - Pa, what did I do wrong? - Nothing, my angel. It's all right. So... You need three big men for one little girl? - Sandra is being reclassified colored. She may no longer attend a white school. - Are you mad? She's ourchild. What are you going to do next? Reclassify my wife and me, as well?! - Keep quiet, or you will lose your daughter. - I'll tell you what... - There are laws in this country. - Get off my property. Now! Don't worry, sannie. I will fix this. - How, Abraham? - The laws are there to protect us. Just have to play these people at their own game, that's all. - Can they really take her away from us? - Trust me... ...just as I have trusted you all these years. - How many times must we go through this? You know that she is yours. - You're always so friendly with everyone in the shop. - Who else is there to talk to? - Are you surprised that people talk in the community? - Talk about what? - I have to live here! - I live here, too. What do you think it's like for me? - Can I sleep here? Nora... - Am I really black like you? No, child. You are not black. Look. - What a shiver jelly! If you stop shivering, you can feel it move. - What? - The baby. I can't feel anything. - There, it's moving. - She's strong! - "She"? What if it's a boy? - Of course, we've always been staunch supporters of the nationalist government. But, you know, to be slapped in the face by our own people is... Indeed, very sore. - Mr. Laing, does Sandra have to be registered as a domestic worker to stay with you? When Sandra's of age, who will she be allowed to marry? - What kind of food does Sandra eat? - Please... - She eats honest, healthy food, made for her by her mother. - Are you concerned that you're gonna be arrested under the immorality act? - I have never been unfaithful to my husband. How do you explain your child's appearance? - I can'texplain it. If there is black blood in our veins, we never knew about it. - Sandra, come to your pa. - This is Sandra. You may take a photograph, but, please, no questions. Smile! - Abraham, you must stop this. - I know what I'm doing. - Freak show, Abraham -- that's what that was. - I'm gonna get her reclassified to white. - How will that change the color of her skin? - I'm doing it for her. I'm doing it for all of us. Look. I brought you a present. Maybe we'll get it through those curls one day. Are you angry? Do you want to hit me? Come on, hit me. Feel better? I brought you something else. - Did you put cream on Leon, too, when he was small? - No. - Because it burns. - Here. Let me blow. Take a seat, please. Name? - Sandra laing. - What's your relation? - We're her parents. - Take a seat. Excuse me? - Sandy. - Thank you. We'll stand. "The definition of a white person "is a person who in appearance obviously is a white person "and who is not generally accepted as a colored person... "Or who is generally accepted as a white person and is not in appearance obviously not a white person." - Is that clear? Come. Shake your head. Harder. Turn around. Stop. All the way. Open your mouth. Show me your teeth. Thank you. You may go. - Wait. Wait! Aren't you going to ask about...Her background, her education, about us, her parents? - We've seen what we needed to see. - So, you see that she is white. - We'll notify you in a few weeks as to what we've determined. - I'm telling you she's white. I'mher father. I'm as white as you are. This is her mother-- undeniably white. And Sandra is ourdaughter-- blood of our blood. - We'll have to ask you to leave now. - No. There is nothing to determine. Look. What is this? What is this? Look! Tell me-- tell me what this is? - Meneer laing, stop! - Look, man! Are you blind?! - Please, pa. Let's go. - Abraham, alstublieft. Enough. - Thank you, gentlemen. Thank you... Very much for your time. Come. - Hey, Sandy. What happens if it looks like Sandra? - You won't love the baby any less, will you? - I love Sandy, but... It's hard, ma. - I know. I know it is. Sleep tight. Sandy? What's happened?! - Should I get pa? - No, just get the calamine lotion from my bedroom. My sweetheart. - They say she's colored. - Abraham, what does it matter what a piece of paper says? Let's just go on with our lives now and look after Sandra the best way that we can. - You don't understand. We're not going to take this lying down. She's ourdaughter. And I'll take on the whole bloody government if I have to. Never give up, sannie. Never give up. - Are you prepared to swear before god and on the Bible that you are the parents of this child? - I am,my lord. I mean... We are,my lord. - Thank you. Call in the next witness, please. - Doctor... sparks, I believe you have a statement to make. - Yes, my lord. I've studied the laings' case closely... - I'm a great admirer of brevity, Dr. Sparks, but will you please give us your area of expertise and a place of work? - S-Sorry. Genetics research fellow at wits university. - Thank you. - I believe there's a plausible genetic explanation for Sandra's appearance. The history of our country is such that many-- indeed, we believe most afrikaaners carry black genes. - Silence. Please go on. - So... Two white-looking parents can contribute enough black genes to produce a child quite a lot... Darker than themselves. This phenomenon is commonly known as a throwback. We prefer to use the more precise term "polygenic inheritance." - Thank you, doctor. Abraham! - What's the matter with you? I didn't kill anyone. Hurry up! We're having a baby! - He looks just like pa. - Do you want to hold him? Just... Cradle his head in the crook of your arm. That's right. Now, the trick to getting him to eat is to rub his tummy just here. Good. And in parliament today, an amendment was made to the population registration act. Descent rather than appearance will be the determining factor... - Tea, boss? - ...in all classification cases. Children must now be classified the same race as their parents.- - Our reporter went to the streets of Pretoria... - Thank god. - ...to gather reactions. - Thank god. This is a betrayal of everything the white man stands for. - She's white again. - Declare them all bastards-- - sannie! - Sandra laing, the lot of them. That's what they are. Sannie! Sannie! She's white again! Sandra, you're white! - Sorry I'm late. The fan belt broke. Fixed it with my tights the way your pa taught me. Who are the handsomes? - They're from the boys' school. They come up here once a month. - That's nice. - Not really. Shall I get my bags? Put your arms down so I can see you. So grown up! "madam this" and "madam that" now. - Aah! Boetie! - Come and play with me. - No, I want to say "hello" to pa. - Tell him not to be late. It's boerekos, your favorite. Come. No. I don't want any more cabbages. I haven't sold last week's yet. And look at your lettuces. They're all wilted. I'll take those... And those-- that's 25 altogether. - You can pay me next week, my boss. - This shop is no place for a young lady. Look, I got you a typewriter. Maybe you can work in an office one day. Much nicer. - Ma... I want it belowthe knees. - You have lovely knees, my sweetheart. And all the girls wear them above these days. - What do youthink, pa? Very... Modern. - Please go. - Sandra, my sweet, you look like you've seen a ghost. - It's all too light for me, ma. - You don't need that stuff. Your skin is perfect. Here. - I don't want to go out with Johann. - Who would you prefer? Marthinus, the swarts' boy? - He's too fat. And he wears these... Tiny shorts. - There's not a lot of choice around here. Beautiful. - But the thing that's not so nice is, every sunday, my father... Chops one of the cock's head off. But the flesh is very tender. The red ones-- the leghorns-- they're the best lay hens. The kids at school-- they always said my mother laid the eggs. Did you know that you can hypnotize a chicken? I promise you. You just put it on its back, and-- and then you draw a line from its beak, and then it just lies there with its mouth open. You know, you don't have to feel bad about looking like a colored. It's okay with me, really. Ooh, I like this song. - Hi. - I think someone's complaining about you. We don't want her kind here. - Please. Let's just go. - Um... I promised my dad I'd keep you out until 6:00. It's just another half-hour. - Will you excuse me? I'm stuck. It might have been easier if you paid your bill. Ooh! That hurt. - That's why I made you laugh. I've got to go. - Just wait here. I'll give you a lift home. You can't walk all the way home. You won't have any feet left. My mother can vouch for my good character. We can go and see her now. It will take us two days, but if you insist. Like my bakkie? - It's yours? - Saved up for it. Two years and eight tons of cabbages. Have you ever driven and danced all at the same time? - I didn't think so. Put on the radio for me, please. My goodness. Aah. - Where do you live? - Driefontein. Just over the rainbow. I better go, before pa comes out. Thank you. Where's Johann? - He dropped me at the gate. He had to get home. Did he talk about chickens all afternoon? Yes. - No second date? - You can't expect to find the right one straightaway. It took me a long time to find your father. - Good night. - Die, dingaan, die! - No. No. Look. You pick your squashes too early. I'll take those and those. 16 altogether. Have Sandra pay you from the till. And no more than we agreed! - Yes, boss. - Thank you. - My feet are still sore. - I have a cure. - Sandra. Bring me the books from last night. - Yes, pa. - What do you think you're doing with my daughter? - Just talking, my boss. - Six feet, petrus. That's the distance you keep when talking to her. Sure, my boss. - Is your hair kroes all over? - Pardon? - Down there, on your thing. Is it kaffir hair or white hair? - Aah! - Bitch! - So, that's twoshe's decided aren't good enough for her. - Abraham, leave her alone. - Do you love me? - That's a stupid question. - Look at me. What do you see? - I see my beautiful girl. - Pa! I'm notwhite. That's what those boys want. A white girl to marry, to have children with! That is enough! You're excused from the table. Go. Go! - Can I help in the shop today? - Shut up! - Didn't you see her bruises? - Love bites. They're kids. - No, he was hurting her. Abraham, you know this isn't going to be easy. - Of course it won't be easy, but what must she do, stay out here with us... Forever? - There are boys at her school, foreign boys... - Foreign boys. - They have different ideas. They could take her away. - "Take her away." When she was born, youwanted to hide out here in the middle of nowhere. And now you want someone to take her away. - No, I want her to have a life. A goodlife. - She will marry an afrikaaner, because that's what she is -- afrikaans! Good morning. Good morning, boss. - Don't go. - So, is it a good secret, the one that you're keeping? - Very. Car needs a new carburetor! Don't wait. Tell Nora to keep some dinner warm for me. - He's still cross with me. - You couldtry harder. You are just as stubborn as he is. - He ignores everything I say. It's not personal. Your pa thinks two words strung together is a conversation. So, are you going to tell me about it? - It's nothing. Doesn't matter. - Those scars-- they're from inyanga, a traditional healer. They're to protect me from evil. They make me strong and lucky. That's how I got you. - What about thatone? From my gogo. My grandmother. She hit me with a frying pan. Here. She's a tough woman. How do you do that? Make me feel better. - I try hard. Where have you been? - For a walk. To see Nora. - Try again. - What are you doing with that kaffir?! Tell me! - No. - I saw with my own eyes. This is yourfault. - Back to bed, sweetheart. - Move your hand, or I will put a nail through it. - Let's hear what she has to say before you imprison her. No more smart talk, Sandy. This is serious. - I like him. Petrus. - Petrus? You like him, like -- like a... Like a friend, like a brother? - A boyfriend. - Petrus is a black man, dirt in this country. - He understands me, ma. - You can't help what you are born with, but you can help what you become. Now, go and wash your face. You have punished your father enough. - Ma... Welcome home, son. Good boy. - Nora. - Cheer up. - Petrus. Petrus... - Go, my boss is angry with you. - Angry with me? - You'd better go. - Hey! Dead and buried. That's how you'll be if you come near my property or my family again. You understand? - Sure, boss laing. Boss laing. - You can't be a brave kaffir, so you must be a stupid one. - I don't think you understand, boss laing. - You have till three-- - boss laing. - Three! - No. Ma! He's crazy! Do something! - Abraham, stop! There are children! Abraham? Remember, she's your daughter. - Why do you think I'm doing this? I didn't let the state take her away. I'm not gonna let some bloody kaffir tear my family apart. - Can I help you, boss? - Petrus zwane. Do you know where he stays? Okay. They say he went to Swaziland to a cousin's for a while. In Mbabane. - Where's the white girl you've stolen? - I didn't seal anyone. - And who are you? - Sandra. - Louder! - Sandra laing. - That's the white girl? - They must be joking! - Get dressed. Both of you. Now! Go. Hurry up! - That's it. In you go. - How long must she be punished? - That's for the magistrate to decide. She's committed a crime. She needs time to think. Repent. All rise. - Be seated. Sandra laing... You've been detained for three months for entering the kingdom of Swaziland illegally. I'm prepared to release you now on condition that you return to your parents' home until you're of age. - Sandra, come. You heard what the magistrate said. - You put me in there. I'm not going with you. - My baby, please come home. Your father knows that he was wrong. Abraham? - We want you home, Sandra. Your mother, adriaan, Leon... And me, too. I-I want you home. - It's not possible. - Please. We made a mistake. Both of us. - Sandra... If you don't come now, you will never see your family again. I promise you. - No, Abraham. - He doesn't mean it. - I'm pregnant. Do you still want me home? - Sandy... - You two are the only family your mother and I have now. You understand? She left you, too, you know! It's coming! - Mama! - Push, push! Sandra... Sandra. Okay. Yeah. Here's your baby. Yes. Yes. Yeah. - Here's your mama. Here's your mama. - Is it a girl? You see mamma, I told you she brings me luck. - Where's your bakkie? - Sold it. Investment for the future. And with this shop, we can buy two more. Maybe 100 more. - Petrus, are you going to sell things more cheaply than in the city? - He's truly a businessman. - Yes, he's serious about this. - Now, this is one thing they'll never take away from us. Can you imagine betsie verwoerd doing that? - Congratulations, petrus. - Hey. - Was petrus always such a show-off? - Always. But with you now, he has something to show off about. - Baby, come, let's dance. Hey, petrus! - Please. He meant no harm. Petrus! Where's the beer? I'm not drunk enough. - Come on. - I thought you were happy here. - I am. - Then why are you writing letters to your mother? - I miss her. It doesn't mean I don't love you. - Sandra said you'd be sweeping the porch in the afternoon. She sent a letter. She also sends her love. - Nora. What did she just give you? - Nothing, boss. - Give it to me. Hey! Tell Sandra her mother wants nothing to do with her. Off you go. Shesha! - He's an angry man. Angry. Angry. - Shesha! If you ever lie to me again, I'll kick you out of here. - Don't. Can't we go to them? - Sannie... - I'm begging you. Please. - You realize how these people are living? - She's your daughter. - Okay. So we go and see them. Then what? We bring them here? Make a home for her and the baby out the back with Nora? - What are you talking about? Sandra has always lived here with us. - And petrus? Must we invite him to live in the house with us, as well? - All I am asking is that we see Sandra and her baby. - No. She made her choice. Leave it. Get out. Get out!! - You know what keeps me awake at night? Maybe she made the right choice. - Put that away. I don't like things that make you sad. - I want to be your wife. - You are. - I mean your realwife. Legal wife. - You know what that involves. Too much of your father in you. - Leave the person beside you alone, she needs to rest. - You too mamma, go to sleep. We're fine here. - Sure. - So, you want to be reclassified colored. - Yes. My son is colored, and I want to marry his father, who is black. - And you are...? - White... According to the government. - Is this a joke? - I'm afraid not. - Are you the father? - Yes, my boss. - Just a minute. I'm sorry. I can't help you. I need your birth certificate. Next! - Wait. What am I supposed to do in the meantime? - As long as you don't have an I.D. Card, you don't exist. - Well, if I don't exist, can I still live with my colored child and his black father? - No. You're breaking the law. - Come. - We're low on vegetables, but if... This is Henry. Beautiful boy! Do you know who I am? Did your mama tell you about me? - Why didn't you write? - I did. Your-- your pa burned all my letters. I wish we had more time. Your pa's gonna be back any minute. - Ma, I need my birth certificate. I want to be reclassified colored. Mama... They could take my baby away from me. - Sandy. Are you sure? - Yes. I'm happy. I'll find a way to get it to you. I promise. Can I keep this... Until next time? - Yeah. Wait! Come again. Or I'll... - Stay in the car. - Your grandson has your eyes. - If I ever find them here, I will kill them... And then myself. You were given more than enough warning! Kromkrans is now a whites-only area! Please proceed in an orderly manner! - Please don't do this, my brother. It's my living, you understand? - Petrus! - Move! I don't know what else to bring. You don't need that, or your birth certificate! In your head, you're still white! - I left my family for you, petrus. I don't know what else to give you. - You don't understand. I have nothing. My son has nothing. And you can always go home. - This is my home! - To hell with the white man. - They take our homes, our families... They move us like cows. ...from one place to the next. And we are supposed to believe we're human. How can we believe that? You know what? My wife is white. She's brought me nothing but bad luck and misery. Her skin is a curse. - Ma Jenny... I'm pregnant again. - It's a blessing. - It doesn't like it, Henry. - Leave me alone. He says his leg is much better. The mine doctor says it's fractured, not broken. He should be able to send money home soon, and he misses you. Not now, Elsie. Ma's busy. - Henry hit me. - Bye-bye. - Bye. Let's hope it bites him? He's sorry he hasn't written in so long, but he was arrested. I can't make out the next bit. Break it up. Break it. That's it. - "My dearest ma, I think of you and pa every day." - You can't read my letters. - Is the white madam telling the kaffir what he can and what he cannot do? - Now, watch carefully. This is how my mother taught me how to make-- - hey. I'm sick of hearing about your mother. You want to make things grow? You need water. Didn't your mother tell you that? Aah! Sandra... - Aah! I'll keep in touch. I promise. You've been like a mother to me. - A gogo maybe. We all have two gogos, but only onemother. - Thank you. - Hello, sister. - Hello to you. - Does Mrs. Sannie laing still live here? - I know you. U-thembi. We played together as children. You taught me to swim! Her father -- "shesha! Shesha!" - Where did my parents go? - ... shesha went to pongola. There were relatives there. A cousin. Yes, I-I think so. - Hey. Do you, want a lift? Lift your feet, kaffirs. White. Let me explain. - Go away or I'll call the police. - I'm Sandra. Ma. Sandy. - It's me, mama. - Sandra. - Please, mama. I need to see you. I left petrus. Tell me where you are. Sannie. Who is it? I'm sorry, Sandra. Your father's very sick. I miss you so much. I love you, mama. - Sannie. I have to go to him now. I love you, too. - Hold with both hands. Hold with both hands. - Where is she? - With Anna in pongola. - Take me to her. - No, Abraham. It's not possible. I'm telling you. You're too sick. I'm going to get your lunch and your tablets now. What the hell are you doing? - I'm going to pongola. I'm going to see her. - You are going nowhere. Now get back to bed. Doctor's orders. - Sannie... - All these years, you've kept us apart. You didn't even want to see the pictures of her children. What has changed? Why is it okay to go now? - Please. I need to see her. - Youneed to see her? I have needed to see her every day for the last 10 years. - I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I was wrong. I need... I have to tell her... Aah. - Come on. - Aah. - You want her forgiveness. You don't deserve it. Neither do I. - Sannie... I'm begging you. - No. You made your choice. Come on, ma. - Let's do it. - Could we ask some questions? Okay, don't look at the camera. And... Did you vote today? - Yes. - She needs to speak up, Hugh. - Yes. Little bit louder this time, Sandra. Most people will remember your story. How do you feel about the changes happening in South Africa? - I'm...happy for the country... But it's too late for me. I haven't seen my parents in nearly 20 years. I don't know where they are. - Special delivery. Sandra. Sandra. Can I get your autograph? - The bitch! She thinks she's too famous for us! Henry! Come and help me, please! Hi, mum. - Hi. - Hello, mum. - Hi. - Is it a secret admirer? - It's from my mother. My father died of cancer. Two years ago. - I can read it for you, ma. - The money's from my father. The same amount he left my brothers. Yeah. - Is that it? - Are you going to write back, ma? - There's no return address. We cannot release that information. I thought this was the newsouth Africa. Haven't you heard of the freedom of information act? - Too many times. - I'm not leaving till you give me my file. - Sir, there's a lady here by the name of Sandra laing. She doesn't want to go away... - Sandra laing? You, won't remember me. I know who you are. - I heard you got yourself classified colored again. - It was necessary. - After all the trouble your father went to. - My father is dead, meneer. - I'm sorry. - Please. I need you to help me find my mother before she also dies. - Sandra. We don't keep those records here. - Where else can I go? - This is a pensions office, not a detective agency. - If she's alive, you must pay her a pension. Surely you have her details. - This one's lost her mother. There's 70 other clerks here, and it's always me. - You've got a kind face. - No, I don't. I have a fat face. People can't tell the difference. - Hello, ma'am. - Hello to you, sister. - Does Mrs. Laing live here? - Sorry, sisi. The old lady left months ago. I heard she had a stroke. - Thank you. Is it really worth it, ma? - I thought you understood. - I thought so, too. But what's wrong with us? Aren't we enough for you? - Of course you are. You never stop needing your parents. They're a part of who you are. Hello, gogo. - Phone for you, Sandra. - It better be serious. - Thank you. Hello? - Listen, Sandra... I, spoke to the chief of police. He made some inquiries. - Sannie? Your daughter's here to see you. - My daughter? Well... Aren't you going to say something? You had plenty to say to that TV reporter. - I just told the truth. - You weren't the only one who suffered, you know. - I shouldn't have come. - Sandra... There's a key in the dresser. No, not there. The - the drawer. No. The... The other one. - Let me help you. - No, I can get it myself. - Don't be so stubborn, ma. Come. Unlock that cupboard. That one. The box. I put it in storage so your pa couldn't get it. - Doves shit a lot. Ma! - It's true. - Your pa didn't like me swearing, but I enjoy it now. - He wasn't a bad man. He did the best he could. - "Never give up." - I wish that I had never heard those words. - No, ma. They kept me going.
