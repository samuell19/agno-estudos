What Are You Doing, Francis? What Exactly Do You Do? Have You Done Anything With Margie Yet? You Don't Know Anything About That. So You Haven't Done Anything With Margie. How About I Go Write You Another Note So That You Can Have A Lot More Time Making Up Shit Like This? [Grunts] So What's The Matter? Is She Getting Freaky On You? It's A Secret, Goddamn It! [Both Panting] You're Bleeding. She Told Me A Secret. It's Not A Regular Secret. Not Normal. You Could Never Tell Anyone. Anyone. Uh, That Doesn't Really Mean Anything About Margie. She's Kind Of Cool... Not Ordinary... You Know, In A Cool Sort Of Way. Edgar Allan Poe Did It With His Cousin. And I Forgive Him That, Of Course... Because He Was A Genius. [Chuckling] [Leg Creaking] How About You, Mr. Gibbney? You're Something Of A...Class Gossip. Do You Know Anything About This? No, Sister. Mr. Sullivan? I've Never Seen That Before. Mr. Doyle?

She Was Really Good-Looking, And She Promised God She'd Be A Virgin, But Then Some Guy Wanted To Marry Her, And When She Wouldn't, - Stop It! Stop It! - He Took Her In A Brothel. And Then He Cut Her Breasts Off. I Won't Tolerate Any More Disrespect From You. Now, You Confess. You Tell Us Why You Did This. Actually, I Heard That He Branded Her-- You Hold Your Tongue, Young Man! You Are On A Terrible Downward Spiral. He Sees In Your Heart. He Knows What You Do. I Fear For You.
