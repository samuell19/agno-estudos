[ILWAD GIGGLING] ILWAD: More? More, more, more! ILHAN: More, more, more? [ILWAD GIGGLING]What's more? Just the legs like that. And then the other one. ILWAD: I want more lotion, Mommy! When are you gonna be president?[ILHAN LAUGHS] ILHAN: Of this house? Yes.Uh-huh. My mom is president! [CHUCKLES] You're that! ILHAN: I'm president?ILWAD: Uh-huh. What makes me president? Uh, you take care of your kids! Oh. That's what makes you president! Well, that's nice. Is that all you need to do to become president? ILWAD: Yes! You work hard. [ILWAD GIGGLES]ILHAN: Mm-hm. And what else? You have to do push-ups like boys! [GIGGLES] Okay. Girls can do push-ups too! ILWAD: Oh.ILHAN: Okay. Ilwad, can I tell you a story? Let me tell you a story. You know, when I was little like you. Uh-huh... My sisters would cut off my hair and make me bald all the time. [ADNAN LAUGHS] Do you know why?Yeah. Because I didn't have a mommy, and no one had the patience to do this crazy business. [CHILDREN CHATTERING] Okay, all done. All pretty. [CHILDREN, ILHAN CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] [♪♪♪] [♪♪♪] [INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE] Right now, we have an ability to exercise a right that a lot of our parents didn't have: a right to have a voice in this country, to be able to participate and do the things that matter to us. This week is actually National Voter Registration Week. So I urge you to... ILHAN: I think coming to the United States and being part of a democracy, to be part of going to caucuses and voting, watching debates, as nerdy as it sounds, this idea of being part of something so small but meaningful has always been embedded in me. Let me introduce our fabulous presenter today. I admire Ilhan greatly, she is a community engagement specialist. ILHAN: It's easy for men to just wake up one day and, you know, say, "I'm running for office," but for us, it's harder. You know, I have young kids. I don't know I could do work and be a candidate and raise a family. But I'm also, like, a Muslim woman, and I'm, you know, a new immigrant, and I'm Somali, and there's all of these noises in my head that are... That are telling me I can't. [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] So I'm the Vice President of the Feminist Caucus for the DFO. WOMAN 1: Oh, you are? So they created... We created these buttons with a hijab, and it says, "I wear a hijab, I'm a feminist, deal with it." WOMAN 1: I love this!WOMAN 2: I want one! [LAUGHS]I need one! [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] ILHAN: When we arrived here in the United States, I was about 12 years old, and we came after living in a refugee camp for four years. And I came here only speaking Somali. So I only knew three words in English, they were "hello" and "shut up." [ALL LAUGH] And they didn't make me friends. [LAUGHING CONTINUES] What happens in a lot of marginalized communities is that we think, "I don't have a voice. This just has been the thing. I'm not gonna be able to make any change, so why bother?" And we were living in the high-rises... [♪♪♪] We have a problem, right? How do you invite, ask, and tap diverse leaders to consider public office? How do we get to those women who went from that zero to one? They were advocates, activists, but they would never consider running for office. Like, you have to be crazy! ERIN: So few women are taught to be powerful. What does it look like to have that gravitas at 34, 35 years old? I met Ilhan, she was introduced to me as someone who should be running. It was the quiet chatter of the women in this community who knew how to spot talent. I was like, why? Why she's wasting this knowledge, and all this brightness? Actually, I was like, I wanted to shake her, say, "You want to go in front of a mirror and see how ready you are?" [ALL CHATTING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] ERIN: Like so many other women, Ilhan had doubts about "Could I win? Who would vote for me?" She understood the political winds that she was going up against. And I said, you need to stop asking permission. I swear to God, she sat back, she look at me, and said, "You're right." ILHAN: They were saying to me, you know, stop. Like, stop talking about all of the reasons why you can't make it work. Say yes, and then everything else will work itself out. [♪♪♪] [MAN SINGING IN SPANISH] ADNAN: Uh, welcome, everybody! Everybody, thank you for coming! Because right now, it is time for Ilhan! [CROWD CHEERING AND APPLAUDING] ILHAN: There are a few people here that I'd like you all to meet. My children, Ilwad. [CHEERING AND APPLAUDING] And...my brother and my dad! [APPLAUDING] ILHAN: When we have new voices in the room, we're able to dream and we're able to make big changes. KEITH: If Ilhan Omar wins, she'll be the first Somali woman elected to public office in the United States. She'll be a trailblazer. But at the same time, you know, the expectations will be heavy on her. People will think that she's... They won't know. Are you only for Somali women? Are you-- Are you for only women or only Somalis? Who are you, and what do you represent? [♪♪♪] My name's Ilhan Omar. I'm running for state representative. All right.Thank you so much. ILHAN: We live in the most unique district in the state. [♪♪♪] It has a rich population of new Americans, students, and old lifetime residents. Yes, hello.Hi, I'm Ilhan! Running to be your state representative. It sort of, at times, feels like a hodgepodge of people. What vision do you have as a state representative? My plans are to make sure that we're doing criminal justice reform. Tackling our mass incarceration problems. And working on environmental justice, where we digress from fossil fuels. Mm-hm. Okay, I'll consider it. Great. WOMAN: Join us?ILHAN: Yeah. And we have one of the highest disparity gaps in our state, and it's more evident in your district because students are struggling. New Americans, which is mainly East African immigrants, are struggling. Right? [♪♪♪] [INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE] ILHAN: We have pressing issues and a lot of young people recognizing that they're living in a generation where it's becoming more and more important for them to get a college education. But the possibility of doing that is sort of fading away. Joining us tonight, as she has on many occasions over the years, representative Phyllis Kahn from Minneapolis. Representative Kahn, delighted to have you join us again. Pleased to be here, Judge. Tell our viewers a bit about yourself. Okay, I'm one of the two most senior members of the legislature, having been elected in 1972. You can do the arithmetic. That's a year or two ago. [CHUCKLES] Right. ILHAN: The district is represented by a 43-year incumbent. You know most of the people, whether they are new or they are a lifetime resident, who are still alive have not had another representative. Well, this was done to fill the regional park gap in Minneapolis and Hennepin County and Anoka County. Regional Parks and lakes... ILHAN: The district has dramatically changed. There's a lot of people who are being left behind, and the complacency and the comfort of sort of being a liberal and not being a progressive that acts on our pressing issues. And for someone to feel comfortable with having constituents that are consistently unhappy, that is not-- Like, that is not what I have come to know as a representative democracy. [♪♪♪] DAVID: What was that woman's--? On the coldest day of the year. It's so cold![LAUGHS] She voted for Nortway. She felt like he was unlucky. Um, and then she voted... DAVID: This district is my home district. I've lived here my entire life. [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] I have put a lot of personal energy and time into not just this race, but this party. Where are we at now? Uh, we have 16. Okay, my name's Ilhan. I'm running for state representative. Oh, okay. DAVID: Have you thought about the race? She grew up around Cedar. Her grandpa used to live in this building. Can I count on your support? Um, six or seven.Yeah... DAVID: Communities of color are communities that the Democratic Party and individual Democratic politicians don't really pay attention to. What are some of the issues that she cares about. DAVID: We've been voting for Democratic politicians for so long, and nothing has changed. And arguably, sometimes our situations have gotten worse. Okay. We're done with the floor, right? Yeah.Oh. DAVID: I met Ilhan when I was working on the Obama campaign. When I say "I'mma", you say "Help out"! I'mma...CROWD: Help out! I'mma...CROWD: Help out! When I say "Obama," you say "'08." Obama!CROWD: '08! Yeah.[CROWD CHEERING] DAVID: I was thinking about transitioning out of electoral politics, but seeing her ability to connect with people, seeing her ability to turn people out, get people engaged, I was like: "She could be a candidate that could radically change the demographics of people engaged in public life." [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] DAVID: When Ilhan approached me about running, I would only help out if we ran a campaign based off of a really simple principle, which was that everybody in this district needed a voice. Phyllis Kahn's come to my door multiple times, asking for my vote, but has never asked me for my opinion. We're up against big forces, and this campaign is about whether this district and this state believes in organized money or believes in organized people. And every time that organized money goes up against organized people, I pick organized people. [CHEERS] That's why I'm so excited about Ilhan Omar, that's why I'm so excited about this campaign, and the issues that we can move. ILHAN: I arrived at the age of 12 in America. The first thing I learned was that I was an extreme other. I was black, which wasn't a thing for me when I was little. I was Muslim, which also, growing up in a Muslim majority, was not a thing that I needed to identify. I also learned that I was extremely poor, and that the classless America that my father talked about wasn't true. It didn't exist. I remember watching a video by Tupac. I don't know if any of you have seen this, where he's talking about the poor people revolting. And he talks about how, you know, he wants to line people up at the White House and start knocking at that door and saying, "Let us in," quietly, but they don't let us in, and then we get louder and we say, "Let. Us. In!" "Let. Us. In!" Until we break down that door. You all need to understand that there is an urgency. There is an urgency to show up. I am optimistic, but I need all of you. [CHEERING] Thank you, all. [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY][FAUCET RUNNING] ILHAN: Is she in there? AHMED: When Ilhan decided to run for office, of course we talked about how will this impact the family and the kids and all these things. And we came to an agreement that: "You know what? In order to make a change, somebody has to sacrifice." You're always making me laugh. [CHUCKLES] [♪♪♪] AHMED: I came here to visit in 1999, July 1st. We came to play basketball. She was at the game. She was young, but she has that, you know, she had that fire. You could call it love at first sight. I knew she was the one. She is the most profound, tangible influence in my life. Trust me, I am who I am because of her, you know? ILHAN: You know, when I'm out door-knocking, the first question people say is like, "Oh, it's so nice," like, "there's a Somali woman running for office." Um, "Did her dad and husband give her permission to run?" Um, or you know, "How do they feel?" and... And it was really important for us to make sure, um, that whatever role Ahmed had in the campaign, it wasn't something that was going to overshadow [CHILDREN CHATTERING] anything that I was doing. She's the boss around here. [LAUGHS] Oh, now you have to say that. She's the boss. [♪♪♪] Yeah, it does. So, like, when you have it on Franklin... [SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] For the next six weeks or so, we are going to be shining a spotlight super hard on-field and all of your recruitment pieces, so as many people as we can turn out to mix. Yeah. BILL: Yes, that is our critical need right now. We cannot have enough volunteers for what the work that we're trying to accomplish, so. We do have, like...BILL: Pretty early on, she asked me to run her campaign, and I said no. [LAUGHS] Because it was gonna be a lot of time and work and effort, and I wasn't ready for that. But it had to happen. ILHAN: ...which is pretty late for when call time needs to get done. There's a lot I'm really panicked about at the moment and... STACEY: I know what's at stake in these elections, and I know that it's hard, and this is a system that I don't trust, and that I don't want to be a part of. STACEY: It's some positioning to favor the incumbent and to favor... STACEY: But I also know that there really is an urgency to have somebody at the state capitol who's talking louder and who's not going to bow down. BILL: Let's flip to the other side now. Um, what is Phyllis's campaign going to say about Ilhan and Ilhan's campaign? DAVID: Is it fair to say she's going to say Ilhan's too young? BILL: Yeah. But her saying unrealistic expectations... BILL: Phyllis has been campaigning on Ilhan doesn't know what's possible at the legislature. She touts out her long-standing history of being endorsed. WOMAN: And also, I've always and ever seen anti-Semitic stuff come up about Phyllis.Yeah. WOMAN: We'd never be a part of that, but there'll be times we have to speak against it or where nothing we say can be construed that way. That's right. This race could get ugly at times. We are gonna try our best to make sure it doesn't get ugly, but we have to be ready to handle it. I'm glad that we had that conversation and we walked... REPORTER: In the DFL District 60B race, Kahn is facing off against two challengers who, if elected, would be the first Somali-American representatives at the state capitol. TOM: Welcome back to Truth to Tell. I'm Tom O'Connell. We've been having a conversation this morning with the three candidates who are seeking to represent House District 60B here in Minneapolis. Incumbent Representative Phyllis Kahn and two challengers to the DFL endorsement, Ilhan Omar and Mohamud Noor. Two years ago, Mohamud Noor, you ran for representative in 60B, and Representative Kahn won with, what, about 53 percent of the vote? Looking back on that, you're back for another try. What are some takeaways for you from that experience? MOHAMUD: Well, I do respect Representative Phyllis Kahn, you know, for her service, and she's done a lot for many of our communities. We-- I deeply appreciate that. But then there are many issues that have been left out from the process. We need someone who can represent those issues and become a champion for those issues, not sitting on the sideline. TOM: Representative Khan, was this one of your most difficult challenges? We've had a lot of elections since 1972, every couple of years. I've been told I historically have the most primary elections of any legislator ever.TOM: Oh, really? Yeah. And of course, the reason is that most people-- I think-- most people, when they contest someone in a primary, there's a good reason for doing it, and so they win. TOM: Yeah.But I always win. TOM: Ilhan Omar, one of the questions I think that people have, Somalis must only care about Somalis, or women must only care about women. How do you see yourself in terms of identity? ILHAN: Yeah. So I think of myself as a community educator. I think of myself as an organizer. I think of myself as a resident and a citizen who happens to be Somali and a woman. TOM: Okay, great. PHYLLIS: You know, we've already talked about the very importance of the university to this district, and my opponents can correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm really the only one with significant university connections. ILHAN: Can I say something before you ask the next question? TOM: Yeah. We're sort of missing something here. What we're missing is that there is a great disconnect in the way that we serve the needs of these students where they will be struggling with a debt that will probably not leave them until the day that they die. They're interested in going beyond tuition freeze, right? This is why I'm endorsed by the President and the Vice President of the Minnesota Students' Association. You wanna comment on that? The group that you're so proud of endorsing you has endorsed my opponent almost every time I've won. So good luck with it. ILHAN: Which group is that?PHYLLIS: My DFL. ILHAN: I didn't mention that. PHYLLIS: Sorry, that was-- Yeah.TOM: It's out there. It's the President and the Vice President of the Minnesota Students' Association. We need another hour. We need another hour here. They have been a constituent of yours for three years now. Yes, yes. [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] [BOTH SPEAKING SOMALI] ILHAN: That's really good. ILHAN: MAN 1 [ON TV]: ...supporting Donald Trump. MAN 2 [ON TV]: Contacted by CNN, the Trump campaign did not speak specifically about tailoring his group with the group's white nationalist ideas. ILHAN: There's a white supremacist PAC making phone calls for Donald Trump. Uh-huh. They're basically saying if you don't want Muslims in this country, support Donald Trump. [CHUCKLES] Do you think that Donald Trump wants your support? I don't know whether he wants it or not. I think he wants support from everyone. [♪♪♪] ILHAN: I was born into an unconventional, brilliant, loud family. My mother was trailblazing and was setting standards for new norms to forget about what society expects us to do, but to do things as we see fit. But I don't really have memories of her. There are some memories that are too traumatic for you that you just block them away. Because we didn't have a mother, my dad just wanted to make sure that our days were always happy. But then the war happened. [EXPLOSIONS] [GUNFIRE] I was 8 at the time, in fourth grade. More than anything happening to us, I didn't want my dad to also die because then we would be orphaned. There was this refugee camp that was opening up in Kenya. That's where we ended up living for the next four years. It was the first time I understood what hunger would feel like, what death looked like. [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] And then we got a chance for a sponsorship to go to America. I remember being in Nairobi and attending orientations and, like, interviews and stuff like that. [MUSIC PLAYING] NARRATOR: The United States of America, a land of diverse regions and changing climates. ILHAN: In the video, they had this, like, beautiful town where, like, all the houses looked exactly the same. And, you know, that was just like, "We're going to America. This is what's gonna happen. It's going to be beautiful." NARRATOR: ...who risked everything they had for the chance to pursue happiness and freedom. They don't tell you when you're a new American, that's not where you're gonna live. So we arrive in New York, and there's, like, graffiti and trash. And I was just like... Like, "This is not what they showed us in the video." And so then he was like, "Yeah, we're not at our America yet, Ilhan. We're still going." [MEN CONVERSING IN SOMALI] Assalamu alaikum. How are you guys? Good. We have an election ballot... next Saturday. [♪♪♪] [BOTH SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] ILHAN: DAVID: The traditional campaign wisdom has been you target this very narrow section of voters that have voted a lot of the time over the past few years. [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] There's this myth that low-income people, young people, people of color don't care about politics, but the truth is nobody's asked them to get engaged. And so I thought, you know, "Why not check this out?" Yeah! Our district has not had a representative that has spoken on behalf of students and engaged with students in 40 years. I truly believe in a representative democracy. Right? Like, this is-- This is the basis of what our democracy is built on. What makes you support BLM? 'Cause I see a lot of politicians just mentioning that, like, all lives matter just, like, not wanting to-- Not wanting to state the exact reason why Black Lives Matter is so important and why the movement is so important. Why I'm really, really excited about the movement is that it has this ability to waken the conscience of people like nothing has done before. What you're doing, the push that you are creating, is allowing for our voices to come through. [APPLAUDING] WOMAN: Our state representatives here are the ones who make the decisions about what tuition costs and, like, advocate on the behalf of you as a student here. So we should get the most progressive candidate that we can in office. If you haven't, you know, gone to a caucus before, if you're kind of iffy on being active, this is a great way to make impact at the local level. Yeah. So... MAN: Everybody... TOM: I am concerned that student turnout may not look like what we want it to. STACEY: People just like to say, "Yeah, sure. I'll be there," and so it's unpredictable, and it's unpredictable with the presidential race, how many of them are gonna be out there. I think that's been what we've mostly been panicking about. PHYLLIS: The other side is better. Here's the other side. Bernie Sanders. Brooklyn, New York. Child of Eastern European Jewish immigrants. Phyllis Kahn. Brooklyn, New York. Child of Eastern European Jewish immigrants. Longest-serving independent in Congress. Longest-serving female legislator in America. [♪♪♪] PHYLLIS: I was at Cornell. I had asked my adviser for a recommendation, and he wrote a one-line recommendation which says, "This person has no ability for graduate work. "She should be a housewife." The most appalling thing about that recommendation was that if he had ever been in my house, he would have seen that the only hope was to go to graduate school. I ended up going to Yale, got a PhD in biophysics. At the meanwhile, the Women's Movement was starting, and I had started looking at what the legislature looked like, and it seemed like a good time to run. I cannot say anything negative about Phyllis. I think she deserves to be recognized for all the work that she has done. But I think 43 years is a very long experience. This is an opportunity to bring different voices, young voices that reflect the population that she represents now. The fast-growing population in this state requires a very in-depth knowledge of those communities. Ilhan, for me, represents all of that. [♪♪♪] It's hard for me to understand why Ilhan's not able to get more support and more endorsements. We do say often that we want to encourage more people of color, more people of different backgrounds, people with disabilities to run for office. Yet, you know, when we have those individuals, we always question their ability. "Oh, well, you haven't-- You haven't been here long enough. You really don't understand how the system works." Now that they want to be in positions of leadership, we're telling them, "Well, you are not good enough." [ILWAD CHATTERS INDISTINCTLY] ILWAD: Oh, I forgot my phone. [SQUEALS]Here's the pillow. I don't-- Thank you! AHMED: Be careful, yeah? ILWAD: Okay, Daddy. ILHAN: On the third, we have a fundraiser. That's Friday, June 3rd.Yeah. Friday night?Friday night. And then, um, during the day, we have a fundraiser in Faribault. Oh, my God...So I'll be gone all day Friday. And then Bill is having one on the 23rd of June at the Coyle Center. Again? [LAUGHS] AHMED: Thursday night? Um, I'm probably going to Ohio too. You're taking the kids, right? ILHAN: The third is the last day of school for the kids. I know that one. [CHUCKLES] But I do want you to be home tonight. There's no way. I'm not gonna be home till like 8. Will you be home by 9? 8:30-- Yeah, probably by 9. 8:30 or 9?9. 9? Should I record it? 9, 9:30. No. Before 10, I'll be home. See, I knew it. [♪♪♪] [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] Left on 12th. There'll probably be a lot of people there right when we get there. But we're gonna leave 'cause we have to get you to 3-3 in time for you to speak. [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] ILHAN: Wow. [INDISTINCT CHATTERING CONTINUES] I'm Ilhan.Hi. I'm running for State Representative. Hi, there. I'm Brandon.I'm Ilhan. Nice to meet you. I'm running for State Representative. Please stick around to become a delegate. Thank you so much. Go help your state rep! MAN: Turnout's so high they got conservative with giving out lit. Oh, my God. MOHAMUD: Good evening. My name is Mohamud Noor. I just wanted to say this is a big day for us, a great day. If we could just move our people back this way. [SPEAKS IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] We need young people! And I need you all to move away from complacency, to move away from familiarity, and take a chance, so invest in me, invest in our state, invest in our kids, invest your time, and make it happen. [APPLAUSE] You should move up. ILHAN: I'm getting a headache. You get a whole 5-7 minutes. Oh! I didn't-- You didn't tell me that. I told you now. I could've said a lot of things. I could've said my whole platform in five minutes. Oh, my God. That line is also pretty long. [PHYLLIS SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY OVER MICROPHONE] ...environmental issues, arts and culture issues... WIL: The guy in that Bernie shirt over there. Yeah.She said you should talk to him as well.Okay. What is the main sort of things you're pushing for? My only concern is gay rights. Making college affordable and accessible. I've worked on the Vote No Amendment and I'm a member of Stonewall. And reforming our criminal justice system are my three top priorities.Okay. WIL: Should I just..? [LAUGHS] Oh, my God, the Coyle Center's full, overflowing full. [CHEERING]BILL: I think we expected a couple hundred people, but there's already, like, 500 people here and probably more coming. So this is two or three times as many people as we expected. This is an amazing turnout. MAN: Yep!I gotcha. All right. Are you ready?Yes. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [SPEAKING IN SOMALI] [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] You can do it! We haven't elected in 2-6 yet. So you could hit one more caucus. Okay. Okay. [SHRIEKS HAPPILY] So thank you, first of all. We got the most delegates out of this precinct. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] We need to decide who is going to the Senate District Convention for Ilhan. [♪♪♪] [DAVID CONTINUES SPEAKING, INDISTINCTLY] ILHAN: Hi, Travis. This is Ilhan Omar, candidate for District 60B. How are you doing? Are you still planning on going to the convention? She's probably a pretty big bundler for Hillary. Hi, Lisa. This is Ilhan Omar. I wanted to touch base with you about the convention. ANDY: This next person, is a software engineer. His Facebook isn't public. I wanted to talk to you about the upcoming convention on April 9th. ANDY: Losha... ILHAN: I think there is a lot of potential for things to go wrong. Hi, Losha. This is Ilhan. So you have to make sure that you are holding on to the people that are committed to you. Oh, okay. And have you decided who you're supporting yet? Yeah. That is true when you're there for 43 years, you tend to know a lot of things. Show me Sasha's Facebook? ANDY: She's posted about some LGBT equity stuff, like the HRC logo and stuff, so maybe that's an angle. Also, roller derby lesbian. So, like, we can talk about queer stuff. What? She posted about it. It's not like-- I haven't even-- I can do way creepier research if I need to. [LAUGHS] Oh, my God. You are scary. Hi, Clarissa. This is Ilhan Omar. My opponent is younger than me and prettier than me and, um, apparently, to some people, nicer than me because she kind of agrees with everything anybody asks her about. ILHAN: ...caucus for March 1st. PHYLLIS: You know, I've talked to several people who are listed in the Omar caucus who were totally supporting me. So you know, it's very hard to tell by just the general numbers that you see. You really have to make individual contact. MOHAMUD: Phyllis has got a base. Ilhan established a base with the students. I've got more confidence that I've got the majority of the support within the Somali community. Let the people decide. PHYLLIS: It's very competitive. So I don't really wanna make any predictions. ILHAN: At some point, I'd like to hide under my bed It's-- It's a little scary. But we-- It needs to be different. WOMAN: Now, I like this paragraph a lot. MAN: That's my favorite paragraph to read. WOMAN: I think we should try to rephrase... Check it out... WOMAN: ...the "Ilhan is not really different" part. ILHAN: Yeah, that. I don't know what else... MAN: I-I-I-- Yeah. Wait, you haven't heard about that one? MAN: No! There was a comment where Phyllis said that my scarves over the years have gotten silkier, my jeans have gotten tighter, and my skin has gotten lighter. Well...okay. [LAUGHTER] Implying I'm getting whiter as the years have gone. I don't actually own any silk headscarves. Right? 'Cause they don't wrap.Right. They would-- WOMAN: They won't stay on your hair. It's not a hat! [LAUGHTER] [♪♪♪] ILHAN: When 9/11 happened, there was more soul searching about who I was and what-- What my scarf meant and how I wanted to present myself. And so for me, I made the decision to wear my headscarf because I found value in it. It's like a badge of honor to show that I am a person who belongs to the Muslim faith. I mean, there's challenges of, like, thinking about how am I going to present myself today and how it's going impact or how people are gonna react to me. Like, how do I own my feminist identity and still be Muslim, right? And still be Somali. I just think I'm a person, and then someone says something and I'm like, "Oh, you must be curious about something. "Why? I don't understand why this is a thing." [PEOPLE SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY][CAR HORN HONKS] CAWO: What complicates this election is that you have a Somali man in the mix. And here, then, what we end up getting is the gender politics that comes to the floor. And this, of course, creates new dilemmas for the community. A lot of the gender biases that are very much in the Somali culture, but also in most cultures comes into play. This idea that a young woman who has children wanting to be at the forefront and running against a Somali man, you know, they might see it as a threat to what is considered tradition. And also, it's undermining the potential for this man to win. HABON: When Mohamud Noor announced that he was running, I was like, "Ah, this is gonna be ugly." [CHEERING] I had a bad fear of the community divided. Ilhan was told that she wouldn't be able to convince the elderly community because she's a woman. And she was like, it was the only time of my life I wanted to be a man. ILHAN [IN SOMALI]:NUR [IN SOMALI]: ILHAN: ILHAN [IN ENGLISH]: This mosque, right, Abbu? [IN ENGLISH] Yeah.This is the one we're going to. [IN SOMALI] [IN SOMALI] [IMAM SPEAKING IN SOMALI] So it's... It's going okay. Okay. Yeah. There's a lot of interest. Oh, yes. We know that. ILHAN: Do you support women running? IMAM: Mm-hm. Yeah. I need a prayer, so maybe you'll give me a prayer. [BOTH LAUGH] ILHAN: A blessing, a prayer. IMAM: I'll do that.ILHAN: Yeah? IMAM: And I think it's--ILHAN: It's Friday. So I'll be here if not to take advantage. [LAUGHS] [IMAM LEADING PRAYER] IMAM: Allahu Akbar. Sami'Allahu liman hamidah. Allahu Akbar. Allahu Akbar. Allahu Akbar. [SPEAKING SOMALI] [ALL SPEAKING SOMALI] [TRAIN BELLS RING] [♪♪♪] [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] No, I was just talking to people here, but I'm gonna go to the floor. WOMAN: Okay.BILL: At the convention, if any one candidate has 60 percent of the vote, they have secured the DFL endorsement. All right. We're gonna begin voting in about 30 seconds. BILL: The endorsement means that's the person at the primary that's gonna have the party letter next to their name. There's a buzz in the air at a convention. Everybody knows the risks, the stakes. Yet there's only a couple hundred people who are going to be influencing it. WOMAN: Thank you very much. And they're all in sight of one another. There's a man sitting next to a red shirt, flannel shirt. Yep. Yep.He won't give me anything. He's also my neighbor. Talk to him.Okay. He's wearing a Phyllis button.Yeah. It's an honorable way to leave. Yes. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. I hear you. With the priority in where that experience was being used isn't really benefiting us. Two years.Yeah. WOMAN: Delegates, we have results. Please have a seat so that we can read them out to you. Phyllis Kahn: 89 votes for 34.50 percent. [APPLAUSE]Let me get through this first. Mohamud Noor: 28 votes for 10.85 percent. Ilhan Omar: 141 votes for 54.65 percent. [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] We will begin in five minutes. [MAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] MAN [SHOUTING]: Hey! Hey! Hey! I believe that we...! [EXCITED YELLING]ILHAN: Thank you, guys! We are really, really, really, really, really, really close to getting this win. We are asking, begging for all of you to be patient for maybe another hour. WOMAN: Almost there.ILHAN: Almost there. DAVID: We're doing really well, but Phyllis's campaign is trying to elongate this process, make this day as long as possible, play off of the classism that exists in this party that doesn't allow young people, people of color, and working people to stay for long periods of time at this convention. Get some food, recharge a little bit, and get back on the floor.[WHOOPING] Do we know the vote totals yet? So no endorsement, one. WOMAN: Does everybody's things say... [INDISTINCT CHATTER] All right, the results of Ballot Four: Phyllis Kahn: 33.88 percent. Ilhan Omar: 54.69 percent. No endorsement, 11.43 percent. We will proceed to a fifth and final ballot in 5 minutes. LAURA: We've hit hour 12. All our people are holding really tight, like, impressively tight. [CHANTING] I believe that we will win! But our persuasion program is basically broken. Like, there's no one left to persuade. [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] [SPEAKING SOMALI] [SPEAKING SOMALI] WOMAN: All right. Phyllis Kahn: 33.20 percent. Ilhan Omar: 55.42 percent. [PEOPLE CLAP AND CHEER] WOMAN: And no endorsement: 11.34 percent. [PEOPLE CLAPPING AND CHEERING] WOMAN: As we have reached our fifth and final ballot, we have no endorsement, and this body will not endorse before the August primary. [♪♪♪] [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] REPORTER 1: Now there will be a primary in August with Kahn, Omar, and Mohamud Noor, a Somali-American who almost defeated Kahn in 2014. Looking forward to the primary, and I think the voters will have the opportunity. This is-- This is their opportunity to decide who is gonna represent this district. REPORTER 2: Are you in a David-versus-Goliath scenario where for the first time you're the David? Um, surely in the Convention, but I'm not sure that in the real world that that's true. Well, one factor that might help Kahn is that the primary will happen during the university's summer break in August when most students will be elsewhere. [♪♪♪] BILL: If this election is characterized by low student turnout in the primary, then the two main communities that do show up are older, established, white homeowners and the newly energized and politically-activated, um, Somali community. If there aren't students to balance out this equation, and Ilhan splits the Somali community and against Phyllis, splits the white community, it will be a tougher road to hew. I'm a little exhausted. Okay, so then we have a couple on 27th. 2319... is this way. ILHAN: It's summer. It's hot. There's that struggle with just trying to figure out how to keep people hydrated and motivated enough to go out. [♪♪♪] [KNOCK ON DOOR]MAN: Hi. ILHAN: Hi, I'm looking for Julie. MAN: Hold on one second. WOMAN: Yeah, Phyllis has been doing what she can to kind of talk up the neighbors here. You can see that across the street. You know, I hate to see Phyllis get moved out of office. ILHAN: I've learned if I control my panic, it goes a lot easier. [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] Quick announcement for everyone. We have sunscreen and bug spray over here. Please use it before you go out. We also have a fridge full of cold water. Please, please, please take a bottle with you. We really would prefer you don't pass out. ILHAN: I think there is so many hopes and dreams of a lot of the young people who are involved in our campaign. MAN: The folks who said they're gonna vote, we're still gonna knock. If they are in a building, we're knocking-- I-- Absolutely not. Absolutely not. They've already voting, we're not gonna waste time knocking. That's a waste of time.That is incredibly-- ILHAN: But, like, the anxieties get bigger, the emotions run high. The amount of distrust in the student vote needs to be eradicated from this campaign. This isn't distrust in the student vote. This is distrust in any vote. Yeah-- Wait, wait, wait. We know who's... So... It's a lot, trying to change the world. [BOTH SPEAKING SOMALI] Okay, so, um, tomorrow morning, we'll meet up at 7:30. If you are, like, a guard for a building, stay there. Don't leave. If the next building is burning, let the building burn. [PEOPLE LAUGH]Seriously. Like, this is how it works. Because they're going to have cars. They don't have as many voters as we have. So they will take our voters. Okay? So, like, this is real. [BIRDS CHIRPING] [♪♪♪] ILHAN: Can I eat, maybe? You cannot eat at all today. It's Election Day. No eating. ILHAN: It's going to be very divisive. I think the odds are stacked up against us. The other individuals you are talking to, this group's campaign. The two individuals you are talking to... We're a different campaign.I don't care what... ILHAN: The elders subscribing to these ideas of: "He's the man, he's more deserving because he is the breadwinner in his family." MOHAMUD: DAVID: Just pull up to the 2100 block, which is the next one, and just wait there for a minute while we go hit three houses. Okay, take those. ILHAN: We're trying to make sure that we are out here until the last poll closes, and to not have any doubts when we lose about how much more we could have done. So... Hey, how's it going? Have you guys voted yet today? So we need as many of you voting so that we can reclaim our power and have negotiating power for us. We'll do our best to vote. All right, thank you. WOMAN: Two votes, let's go. Three votes.Four votes. WOMAN: Four?That guy was married. ILHAN: Hi, William. This is Ilhan Omar. I'm calling to talk to you about, um, voting for me today. And then turn left.We had a guy say he had to ask his wife. If it was okay to vote for Ilhan. Yes. See? [CHANTING AND SINGING] [CHANTING] It's time for a woman to lead! Ilhan! It's time for a woman to lead! Ilhan! It's time for a woman to lead! Ilhan! It's time for a woman to lead! Ilhan! It's time for a woman to lead... How's everybody feeling? Hi, guys. Did you vote in the primary today? Are you guys able to vote? Did you get a chance to vote yet today? No, not yet. Are you planning on it?No, not really. Have you had a chance to vote yet today? Got an hour still. Excuse me, have you guys voted yet today? Have you voted yet in the primary today? Oh, no, thanks. I just... No, thank you. Yeah, there's only 45 minutes before the polls close. ILHAN: People die in parts of the world for the right to vote. Hey, how's it going? Our district, the highest number of young people who voted are 123. Oh, my goodness. Yeah.Right? Your vote might win us this. Hey, I'm here in this town. Hi, everyone! Everyone, you should vote for her now. Ilhan Omar! Polls close in 45 minutes. Get out there. Bye! [LAUGHS] [PEOPLE CHEERING] Vote, yes! This is like a car wash or something. [LAUGHS] Hey, um... You look really pretty today. Today? Only?Yeah. Only today. 'Cause you voted for me. That's it? It's because I'm a delegate? That's what makes you look pretty today. I was praying today. I was like, "Jesus, I know Ilhan is Muslim." [LAUGHING] WOMAN: Keep going. "Jesus, Ilhan is Muslim..." "Please make an exception for her today." Okay, I'm going to go wash my face and stuff. WOMAN: We'll see you there.Okay. All right. MAN: What, are you talking to--? Hi!Oh, my God! Hello!How are you guys? Good.Yeah? I want a hug.Yeah? You guys are good? [BOTH SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] ILHAN: 27, 24. MAN: We're waiting on it. Um, they said the results would be in... within seconds, and it's been more than seconds at the moment. So we're just gonna click refresh until the seconds are done. How are you feeling?Good. We're not too far. ILHAN: What's the total for 210? 30-20. You have it in front of you. DAVID: It's in front of you. ILHAN: Oh, that was added in. Okay. MAN: Yeah, like 20 minutes ago. What if it magically refreshes itself just when you stop refreshing it? [CHUCKLES] And we sit here for 10 minutes, and the results have already been up. [LAUGHS] Okay. Excuse me. I apparently finished that. [ILHAN LAUGHS] I can't see results! Do you not have Twitter? Somebody check Twitter. Are we on the wrong website? What?MAN: Who did? Pat Garofalo is texting results that we won. ILHAN: We what? I don't know where he's getting these, though. He says what-- Pat Garofalo says Ilhan Omar, 2402 votes for 40.95 percent. Mohamud Noor, 1738 votes for 29.63 percent. Phyllis Kahn, 1726 for 29.42 percent. It says. [♪♪♪] Oh, my God! It's in! Yeah! [ALL CHEERING, CLAPPING] I won! I won! I won! [PEOPLE CHEERING] [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] [CROWD CHEERING AND APPLAUDING] [CHANTING] Ilhan! Ilhan! Ilhan! Ilhan! [APPLAUSE CONTINUES] [CROWD CHEERING] I love you. [CROWD CHEERING AND APPLAUDING] REPORTER: We're tracking a historic upset. Ilhan Omar defeating Minnesota's longest-serving state legislator Phyllis Kahn in the Democratic primary for State House District 60B. That means come November, we'll have the first Somali-American lawmaker in the nation. I want to remind you all that what we did tonight, no one thought was possible. [CROWD CHEERING] [♪♪♪] ERIN: We were just through the roof that Ilhan had won the primary. That was one of those moments that was like: "Yes! It works. The country is going in the right direction." And then, unfortunately, like what happens with so many women and so many women of color, we've got to find something wrong with them. We've got to have a flaw. Well, turning now to a controversy brewing in Minnesota over a candidate, her marriage status, and allegations of immigration fraud. Ilhan Omar is poised to become the first Somali-American state lawmaker in US history. But now, questions surround her alleged marriage to two men at once with accusations that one of those marriages is to her own brother so that he could get into the U.S... Would be immigration fraud. Here to help us make sense of all this... ...by the campaign, but a campaign that continues to flatly and absolutely deny these allegations that are floating out there, that this candidate was somehow at one point married to two men, or that she had committed immigration fraud in any way, shape, or form. [♪♪♪] They were like, "No, no, no. We cannot allow an hijab-wearing, brown skin woman to represent Minnesota." She was devastated. ERIN: It just seemed irresponsible from the media to pick this up. It seemed irresponsible that people were festering it and saying this somehow disqualified her or didn't make her the powerful person that she was. REPORTER: In a lengthy statement, Omar explained that in 2002, when she was 19 years old, she applied for a marriage license with the father of her children and love of her life, but they never followed through and therefore were not legally married. The couple broke up in 2008, and Omar says she married another man legally in 2009. Two years later, they broke up, but Omar says they only divorced in their faith tradition. Since then, Omar says she reconciled with the first man and they're raising their children together adding: [READING ON-SCREEN TEXT] ILHAN: "Now the question that needs to be asked "is why are these absurd and hateful rumors being circulated? "It matters that I am a woman. "It matters that I am a Somali-American woman. "It matters that I am a Muslim immigrant woman. "Despite the best efforts of those who wish to divide us "and stand in the way of progress, "rest assured that petty rumors like these will not distract me "from the important work that lies ahead for our communities." ILHAN: Hi, guys. Are you voting this year? You already voted?No. You know about early voting?Yes. Okay, wonderful. Thank you so much. Okay. Thank you. KEITH: All right, you guys. We got just a few more hours until it's Election Day. Y'all ready?[CROWD CHEERING] KEITH: She's awesome. We're proud of her. We brag about her all the time. Ilhan Omar, everybody. [CROWD CHEERING AND APPLAUDING] I want you guys to shout on top of mountains and make sure you let people know that this is a crucial election cycle. So are you all ready to show up for your values? [CHEERING AND APPLAUDING] Are you all ready to show up on the 8th? Are you all ready to make history twice in this district? Elect me and Hillary? [CHEERING AND APPLAUDING] [CHANTING] U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.! Here in Minnesota, you've seen firsthand the problems caused with faulty refugee vetting, with large numbers of Somali refugees coming into your state without your knowledge, without your support or approval, and with some of them then joining ISIS and spreading their extremist views all over our country and all over the world. [CROWD BOOING] And years from today, you'll be able to say you voted for a stronger, fairer, better America. WOMAN: Wow, good morning. It is Tuesday, November 8. It's Election Day. What's happening today? It's here at last. ILHAN: You ready?Yeah. ILHAN: What day is today? Mommy Day!Mommy Day! [♪♪♪] ILHAN: Hi. Thank you for voting. Thank you so much for doing this. You're welcome. When Donald Trump came in and was spewing all that hate, I had a tendency to not get angry because I knew that this message, this hateful message was going to be the thing that motivated minority communities that don't often turn out to vote to come out for love. WOMAN 1: What do we want?ALL: Voting! When do we want it?ALL: Now! WOMAN 2: Let's go vote, everybody! REPORTER [ON PHONE]: It is game day. It is Election Day. It is the day we crack that glass ceiling. We're in Philadelphia knocking on doors, getting out the vote for our girl Hils. If you're rockin' a pantsuit like we're rockin' a pantsuit, if you're voting for Hillary like we're voting for Hillary, say hello. We're glad to see you. Get out there and vote! [♪♪♪] [CHEERING AND APPLAUDING] [ROCK MUSIC PLAYING] Minnesota, you have elected a Somali-American Muslim woman. [CHEERING AND APPLAUDING] ♪ Now watch me whip ♪ ♪ Now watch me nae nae ♪ ♪ Now watch me whip, whip Watch me nae nae ♪ ♪ Now watch me whip ♪ ♪ Watch me nae nae Now watch me whip... ♪ MAN: How do you feel?ILHAN: I'm feeling excited. Tonight is a great night and I hope it ends as a great night, um, not only celebrating my win but we get to celebrate the national win as Hillary is elected as the first woman President. MAN: Thank you so much. Congratulations.ILHAN: Yeah, thank you! [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] [SPEAKING SOMALI] ILHAN: Oh, my goodness. Oh, my God! So this is-- it's done. You're serious about this? WOMAN: Yeah. That's like... That's scary that the hateful rhetoric can find a partner in the hearts of many in our community. How different the world of tomorrow is going to be... um... for many of us. [♪♪♪] PHYLLIS: Well, I woke up the next morning. I suddenly realized I never have to go to a meeting I don't want to go to anymore, I never have to be polite to an asshole again, of which so many people, when I say that, tell me I've never been polite to anybody ever. So. [LAUGHS] I mean, she won. There's nothing to feel about it. Fortunately, the margin was big enough so that I don't have to obsess about what was the will of the district. She's coming in as a much more public figure than anyone else is, and I think my advice would be to make use of that. [♪♪♪] [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] WOMAN 1: Do you solemnly swear or affirm that you will support the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the State of Minnesota, so help you God?ALL: I do. WOMAN 1: Congratulations.[APPLAUDING] WOMAN 2: Miller, present. 60B, Ilhan Omar. Present! WOMAN 2: Omar, present. MAN: It's a great honor and joy to join all of you as we congratulate my sister. You know, this is not a place that many of us show up. I think Ilhan is calling us to show up. [♪♪♪] Oh, my God. I might... I might start crying when I see her name plaque on there. Oh, it's not on there yet. Thank God. I'm not gonna cry. JOELLE: Ilhan's primary victory was always going to be on the front page of theStar Tribune. Did we know that she was going to be trending on social media outlets and having this, like, landfall of letters coming in from all over the world? No. Ilhan Omar, the country's first female Muslim refugee in elected office. I'm proud of your election because of what your community was sort of subjected to for national political purposes. ILHAN: We are about creating a movement where people understand that there is real representation in a representative democracy. JOELLE: People are looking to her to be a leader nationally and be a spokesperson for Muslim communities and immigrant communities and black communities, and it's like, we did not see that coming. CROWD: This is what democracy looks like! Tell me what democracy looks like. CROWD: This is what democracy looks like! [CHEERING] As we stand in front of the people's house, I remind you that you are the powerful ones. Now the lawmakers of this state, of this country work for you. [CHEERING] It's unclear exactly how many people have been detained at U.S. airports this weekend or how many have been released. President Trump's travel and immigration crackdown on people from seven Muslim-majority countries has caused chaos and confusion and sparked intense protests. ILHAN: It is time for you to wake up. It's time for you to act. This isn't just something that is happening to other people. It is happening to us. REPORTER: Frankly, Representative, it was easy to find hateful comments about you and I-- ILHAN: Sadly.REPORTER: Sadly. ILHAN: If-- If these conversations were about a piece of legislation that I am working on, then we can engage in debate about that, but my identity is not up for debate. So I want you to think about the kind of message that you are sending. The reality is you can't make us disappear. We are part of this state. We are part of this country. I think all that is a little... surreal. It's like, "Oh, my God, it's crazy that I get to be on national TV because I'm State Representative." TREVOR: Please welcome Minnesota State Representative Ilhan Omar. [AUDIENCE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING] Actually, I invited President Trump twice now to come and meet my family and my community. My grandfather and father always said that you should invite your enemy to your home and make them a friend, and so...[AUDIENCE APPLAUDING] So I wanted to give the president an opportunity to make amends with our community, and at least to come and have our famous Somali tea. You know, that's the least he can do. He represents us now as well. All right. There it is. President Trump, have some Somali tea. Thank you so much for joining us. Representative Ilhan Omar, everybody. [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] ILWAD: I want some. I'm gonna get this one. [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] I want some skin and barbecue. ILHAN: Are you sure you don't want to try it? I'm vegetarian. ADNAN: One bite. I'm vegetarian. ADNAN: A nibble. ILWAD: Just a little. [LAUGHING] ILWAD: ILHAN: And that makes you a cute girl? Yeah.Okay. ILWAD: Questions. You have questions? What kind of questions? ILWAD: That's a good question. Why do you think? What's the answer, you think? Because, um... It's for the greater good. [♪♪♪] [PEOPLE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] DAVID: When we started out, people were really skeptical, said like, "You can't win a campaign like this. You can't win a campaign by expanding the electorate. You can't win a campaign by trying to bring in new voices." And we said, "No, you can. And you have to." Good morning, everyone. AUDIENCE: Good morning. When I announced, there were a lot of people who told me I shouldn't be running and then there was the Muslims and the Somali community who would say I should let my brother have it. And I would tell them: "I think I could do a better job than my brother." [CHEERING AND APPLAUDING] I believe this is a great moment, perhaps one of the greatest moments of the history of women. It's hard to be optimistic about everything that's going on. Yes, our democracy is messy, but it is our duty to continually do the work, to clean it up, and make sure it shines. My hope today is that you will run-- [AUDIENCE APPLAUDING] --so that our democracy is representative, reflective, and a beacon of hope. Are you ready? [CHEERING AND APPLAUDING] REPORTER 1: Across the country, organizations training women to run for office report exponential growth in women signing up since November 2016. It's not just this increase in the numbers we're talking about who are running for office and running campaigns, it's an explosion. [♪♪♪] This convention, over 20,000 women across this country have raised their hand, said, "I want to run for office. I need to change the direction of my community and my country." That is the power of... You are the first Latina U.S. Senator in history. ...Virginia House where Kathy Tran has become the first Asian-American woman to be elected. REPORTER 2: Danica Roem, who is the first openly transgender person to be elected to state office. REPORTER 3: She's making history. Tammy Duckworth, a double amputee, will be the first Senator to give birth while in office. Somewhere, a young girl of color is watching tonight and realizing that she does not have a limit to how high she can go. This is all part of a movement and... The Women's March became the largest single-day protest in American history. WOMAN 1: We marched, we said "No," but that's not enough. WOMAN 2: It's no longer just march and talk... True patriotism is about fighting for your country and its dignity. A new day is on the horizon! [CROWD CHEERING AND APPLAUDING] [♪♪♪] [WOMEN VOCALIZING]
