(school bell rings) (gentle music) - [Principal] Third period school assembly will take place in the auditorium. The U.S. Forest Service Environmental Program with Ranger Steven Haynes will be speaking on forest in our lives. I'm sure we will all be perfect ladies and gentlemen and listen attentively to Ranger Haynes important message. - Stupid things like that. - Boring? Was it boring? - Yeah, and it also embarrassed me. Every time he speaks he's like, in my ears. - Is he gonna talk- - [Principal] Students, please find your seats. Hurry so that we may begin. - Daddy gonna tell us about the birds and the trees? - Very funny. - Students, it is my pleasure to introduce to you Ranger Steven Haynes of the U.S. Forest Service. He will be showing and telling us about our forest, our environment and our natural resources. Ranger Haynes. (all applauding) - Thank you. Thank you. Well, I hope you all like trees and mountains because that's what we're gonna be talkin' about today is trees and mountains. The mountain itself is called Wolf Mountain. President Theodore Roosevelt declared it a national park in 1902. Now, here is a picture of Simcoe. Now, interestingly, there are a lot of stories about the wolf that becomes a warrior to protect the mountain. And the most famous of these stories is, is when then President Theodore Roosevelt was on a hunting expedition and supposedly talked with the spirit. The story goes that the president was so moved (spitball whooshing) by Simcoe's pleas to preserve the mountain that he pushed Congress into declaring this a national park. Could we turn up the lights, please? Thank you. Well, since that time, no one has reported seeing Simcoe or the spirit in many years. (spitball whooshing) I hope we've done a good job in protecting his mountain for him. At least, I'd like to think so. Whew. Well, (chuckles) if there are no more question I guess I'm about talked out. (all applauding) - Thank you, Ranger Haynes. That was very informative (chuckles). Now students, please leave your seats quietly and wait for the final bell. (students chattering) - Thank you. (gentle music) Hi, Care Bear. How was I? - Fine. - That's it? - I'll see you at home. - All right, well you grab a ride with your sister. She's in the school office, okay? Okay. (students chattering) Well, I thought I was good. - So cute. - I know. - Well, bye. - Bye. (spitball whooshing) That's the second time you've done that. - Ow! (book thuds) What are you hittin' me for? - Sorry. I was aiming at him. (gentle music) - I'm surprised, Kerry, that you would think of disrupting an assembly when your own father is speaking. Such a marvelous speaker, too. Mr. James, you will be working off 10 demerits for this little display. The other two of you five. See what this behavior causes? The school buses have left already. I'll call your parents and tell them why you're late. Maggie is my aide today. She'll drive you home in the school car. (gentle music) - Thanks. - No need, any time. - Look blimp boy, you wanna be a jerk? Fine. Next time don't include me. - Jeez, it's only a couple of demerits. - I never had any demerits before. - Well, you do now. - Way to go, squirt. Daddy's gonna be incredibly torqued. Come on. (siren wailing) Boy, he was in a hurry. - Probably after a speeder. - That your dad? - I don't think so. You know my dad's a cop? - Yeah, everybody does. - Hey, you ever ride in his car? - Once. He let me turn on the lights and siren out on Base Cannon Road once when nobody was around. - Your dad must have interesting stories. - Not really. He doesn't tell me stuff. - How'd you break your arm? - I fell down the stairs. - Yeah, I fall down a lot, too. - I've got to stop the cleaners for a minute to pick up my dress for the movies tonight. Try to behave yourselves for two minutes, okay? - You have a date? Must be a science fiction movie. - (laughs) Whoa, skite attack. - You know, my sweet little sister, if you were anywhere near as smart as you think you are, you'd know how to stay outta trouble and stop making daddy and me ashamed of you (scoffs). - Wow, patriot missile. - Shut up. Daddy's not ashamed of me. What a rotten thing to say. (tires rattling) (pensive music) - These are flat. (music continues) Yep. (engine rumbling) - This is not the way I said I wanted it. (pensive music) (tires rattling) (brakes squealing) (music builds) (tires screeching) (dramatic music) - Great, kids. - Oh. - [Jocko] Lay down and don't even think of gettin' up. (pensive music) (engine rumbling) (siren wailing) (police scanner chattering) - Excuse me, did you do something with my car? - Your car? - It's the school district's car. It was right here. (police scanner chattering) (pensive music) (woodpecker tapping) (whimsical music) (dramatic music) - You know where this road goes? - Yeah, sorta. Well, I mean, it says here on the map that (sighs), this road goes up through a Wolf Mountain Park right here and should hook up with the Highway I-89 right there and then intersects on Southbound 15, somewhere down around- - Hey, keep your eyes on the road will ya? (tires squealing) (dramatic music) Give me the map! - Sorry. - [Jocko] Drive. (pensive music) (engine rumbling) (gentle music) Get back down on the floor or I'll splatter your brains. Got it? (pensive music) - I don't want my brains splattered. - When they stop, we gotta try to get away. They're gonna kill us (whimpers). - Okay, I'll open the door and you run for it. - I can't run that fast. We gotta think of somethin' else, they'll splatter me. - But what? - Um, we could try and choke 'em from behind. - No, that won't work. Their necks are too big. (engine rumbling) (gentle music) (woodpecker tapping) - A yellow four-door Dodge, plate unknown. Car was registered to the school district. Driver was a student aide. - Found some .45 cases on the floor. It's Painter, no money. - How 'bout the kids in the car? - A chubby kid, Casey, something. Another boy, smaller with glasses and Kerry Haynes. 11, blonde. She's my sister. - Anything else? - One of the boys fathers was a deputy, I think. - The smaller one with glasses? Was his name, John? - Yes, I think so. Do you know him? (dramatic music) (gentle music) (engine rumbling) - Hey, what are you gonna do with the kids? - Punch their tickets. - Kill 'em? Why? - What do you want me to do, get 'em a burger and fries? - No, but they're kids. - They've seen us thimble brains. You know, like can identify us. - Yeah, but they're kids. They ain't gonna finger us. Look, they're too scared. Besides, you don't wanna, you know, a murder one rap or nothin' do ya? - I already got one and it's cleaner this way. (Casey groans) - What's wrong? - [Casey] I think I'm gonna be sick. (Casey groaning) (Casey vomits) - Oh my... (Casey vomits) (Jocko scoffs) Fat kid's gettin' sick. - That's it, pull over. Oh, jeez! - [Jocko] Oh, man. All over the back seat (groans). - [Jocko] Get out, now! (gentle music) (birds chirping) (Casey groans) (gun cocks) (pensive music) - Painter, please don't! Lets just leave 'em here, man. Come on. Nobody's gon' find 'em up here 'til we're in Mexico. Painter? (dramatic music) (gentle music) (Jocko laughs) - Next time fatso, I oughta put a bullet in your head for stinkin' up my back seat. That goes for the three of ya! (Jocko spits) - Come on, man. (gentle music) (engine revving) (tires squealing) (Casey coughing) - Are you all right? - (chuckles) Works every time. - You weren't sick? - Nah, I can puke anytime I want. It's like a talent. - Some talent. - It saved us. We gotta get movin'. Those guys are comin' back. - Wait, no they're not, they're gone. - The road's blocked off 'cause it's wilderness now. They have to come back this way to get out. - My dad will be up here with all the cops in the state. We could slow 'em down. - Then they get caught right away and they won't be after us. But how do we stop 'em? - Put nails in the road and flatten their tires. - Where do we get the nails, call up the hardware store? - I know, sharp sticks. You know, like ground stakes. When their car comes down the road it will be going fast enough to maybe puncture the tires. - Yeah, that'll slow 'em down. - Wait a second. Anybody got a knife? - No, I don't got a knife. Nobody's got a knife. - Aw, dang it. (Casey grumbles) Wait a minute. (John chuckles) Cub scout knife. "Never leave home without it." - Why thank you, Karl Malden. (door slams) (somber music) - Nothin' yet. - Who are they? What do they want? - Jocko Painter and Duane Bixby. Escaped from maximum security at the prison yesterday. Painter managed to get a gun and hold up the credit union where he shot one employee. We figured Bixby drove the car. Painter's a lifer. Murderer. - Oh, God. (gentle music) Why would they wanna kidnap three kids? - We don't think it was in the plan. Their car got a flat and they needed transportation. We almost had 'em here when they made the switch. (woman speaking faintly) (gentle music) Kids just happened to be in the car. - Now, wait a minute. I don't think there's anything anybody coulda done. - You know, Pat Jensen? - Hi, Uncle Pat. How are ya? - Fine. I could be a heck of a lot better if we hadn't lost that girl. - He thinks they're headin' through his property. - I said might, Officer, not would. - [John] Might be headin' through his property. - [Steve] 'Bout here? - [Pat] Right about there, yep. - [Steve] Who are the other children? - Well, besides Kerry there's John, my son. - Oh. - And Casey James. Marianne James boy? - Oh. Oh. - Oh. (playful music) (officer thuds) - Why haven't you found them? - It'll be getting dark out there and there's a lotta area out there. I'm goin' in the morning. - I'm going with you. - I'm sorry, that'll be impossible. - My husband may have something to say about that. - Whatever you tell him? - Bring it over here. (pensive music) Come on, they'll be back anytime now. (pensive music) - [John] Are you sure about this? - I'm sure. - Can't do it. - Yes, you can. Get up, come on. - Hey, hey, I don't wanna do it. Look, when I say I can't, I can't all right? - Look, when they come down and hit those stakes, they're gonna wanna kill somebody and with you sprawled here they're gonna have a big target! - Yeah. (pensive music) (birds chirping) (engine rumbling) (dramatic music) (tires popping) - [Duane] Whoa! - All right! Yes! (pensive music) (Casey howling) (shots firing) (Casey screaming) - What is it? - Those kids. I shoulda killed 'em. I shoulda killed 'em! (Jocko sighs) Duane, get the money outta the car and put it all in the pack. - Well, what about the car? - It's shot. We gotta walk to the interstate now because you and your map. - Well, it says right here that the road goes through. Look! - I don't wanna hear squat outta you anymore, got it? Get the money, the food and the ammunition. If we hurry, we can get a cap on those kids before it gets dark. (clip clicks) Move! (bag rustling) - [Duane] Ow! (head bangs) (birds chirping) (Duane speaking faintly) (Simcoe panting) (crickets chirping) (Simcoe howling) - Look! (Casey groans) - I... - Come on, they're after us! - (screams) I've been shot! (Casey groaning) (gentle music) - [John] I can't lift you! - I'm gonna die! I don't wanna die (sobbing)! I don't wanna die (groaning). - He's been shot! - Where? - I think I'm gut shot. Oh (groaning). - More like butt shot. - Hey, that's not funny (panting). - Try to get up. (Casey groans) It doesn't look that bad. - Well, it feels bad! Ow, oh, ow! - We gotta keep movin'! - [John and Kerry] Come on! (Casey groans) (gentle music) (Jocko chuckles) - Sorry. - You know, Duane, sometimes I think there's somethin' really wrong with you. (gentle music) (birds chirping) - This is killin' me. - Well, then we'll have to dig out the bullet. - Dig out? - Yeah, get your pocket knife. - [John] Gee, I wonder what Karl Malden would say. - You're gonna cut me. - It's the only way. Take down your pants. - In your dreams! - Look, you might get an infection and die. I have to take a look. It's okay, my dad taught us first aid. - It's not okay! - Let him look. - Well, hurry. (gentle music) (birds chirping) - Pull down your pants. - Make her leave. - Oh, all right, I'll turn around. (birds chirping) - That isn't a bullet. That's a couple of slivers. You musta got 'em from that tree back there. - [Casey] Slivers? - Yeah, I can get 'em out easy. - Slivers? - Yeah, little wood things, G.I. Joe. You aren't hurt. - Well, what about wood poisoning? My sister had a friend who had a friend and she knows... Hey, turn around! - Come on. (Casey groaning) - Ow, oh! - Don't move or you'll really be hurt. - Oh! (Casey screams) I'm hungry. - Eat these. - What are they? - Berries. - [Casey] Berries? - Yeah, pretend they're gummy bears. (birds chirping) - Mm, they're not bad. Not bad. - We need shelter. - Where? - I remember some caves up here from last summer. (Casey coughs) My sister and I saw 'em when daddy brought us up here. (Simcoe howling) Don't worry, they don't attack people. We'll find a cave. (crickets chirping) - [John] I don't think they'll find us here. - [Casey] Yeah, but the wolves will! - They probably aren't wolves, just a coyote. - Yeah, sure. Whoa! - [Casey] Cool! Hey, go in! - [John] I did! (Simcoe howling) (dramatic music) (branches rustling) (Simcoe panting) (music continues) (Casey panting) - I'm starvin'. - Me too. (Casey gasps) (John gasps) - Dinner. (gentle music) (Simcoe howling) I wish I'd listened to my dad more when we were up here. - My dad and I never went campin'. At least you know about roots and stuff so we didn't go hungry. - Yeah, roots is going hungry. - Your dad never took you camping? - Nah. He wants me to be more of a jock type. I just don't do that same stuff good. I think he's pretty disappointed in me. - I thought it was pretty brave of you to stop for Casey. - Yeah. - Those men coulda caught you for all you knew. - I couldn't just leave him. - Hey, hey, maybe those guys got some food back there. - Oh, we're not gonna find out (chuckles). (Casey grunts) (gentle music) (owl hooting) - Mm (chuckles). You know, these little things are pretty good (laughs). - We gotta get 'em in the morning. The morning. They can't be very far. - Yeah, I know but why? I mean, why not us just headin' for the interstate and get on outta here? We gotta get moving on, man. I bet we can be there by tomorrow afternoon. Maybe even sooner. - No witnesses. You've talked me outta this before. Now I'm gonna finish it my way. - Oh, come on, Jocko. Can't we just forget about 'em? Why are we wastin' our time huntin' 'em down? We should be on that highway headin' south like we planned. I mean, the cops gotta know who we are by now. So, what difference does a couple witnesses make? - We do as I say. - But they're just little kids. They ain't done a- (Jocko yells) (eerie music) - We kill 'em! We kill 'em and kill 'em and kill 'em and kill 'em! You got it? (Duane panting) - Yeah. Yeah, I got it (panting). (gentle music) (Simcoe growling) Hey, what are you doin'? (Simcoe growls) (gentle music) (gun cocks) (shot firing) (Casey gasps) What is it? (Jocko panting) - I don't know. I thought I saw somethin'. - Were they shooting at us? - Too far away. Half a mile maybe. - Bullets go that far? - No, not pistol bullets. - She's right, pistol bullets don't go as far as rifles. - Okay, I'll be sure and tell 'em that when they catch us. - Don't worry. They don't know where we are. We'll get outta here before morning. (Simcoe panting) (crickets chirping) (air whooshing) (gentle music) (woodpecker tapping) (Kerry moans) (air whooshing) - [Simcoe] Do not fear. I am Simcoe, the guardian. I guard the sacred mountain. I keep evil from the resting place of my ancestors. There's evil stalking you in this place. I will help your (speaking in foreign language). - But why me? I am not of your people. - [Simcoe] You have lived a life before this one. You are a guardian in spirit now. The evil one is close. Listen well. First is the earth, then water. The fire is the most powerful. The night grows cold. You will make a fire to survive and fight the evil that has come here. Take two jagged rocks from the ledge near the rear of the cave. Strike them together. (crickets chirping) (fire crackling) - Fire? - Hey, where'd we get a fire? - Go back to sleep. - Oh, that's warm. - I remembered how to make a fire without using matches. (Casey exhales) - You all right? - Yeah, I was just having a wonderful dream. (crickets chirping) (eagle calls) (woodpecker tapping) (gentle music) (eerie music) (shot firing) (Kathy screams) - Kathy, wake up! You're dreaming, you're dreaming! - Hey, what's going on here? - Kathy, you okay? - Oh my God, Kath. - Kath, you're freezing. No wonder, you left the window open. - Oh, it was so real. (window closes) - [Blonde] Where's your bathrobe? - Here, come on, put this on. - It was a bad dream, that's all. - [Brunette] Cory? - No, it was more than that. (line humming) (button clicking) (line trilling) (phone ringing) Answer, Daddy, answer. (line trilling) (birds chirping) (engine rumbling) - [Officer] Sir, what are we doin' here? Watch the cliff on that. - Everyone organized? - Not exactly. No one's sure where to go. - Well, get 'em organized. - Come on, let's do somethin'! (horse whinnies) - Steve, these boys are just a little unorganized. - These boys couldn't find their heads with both hands. - Yeah. Listen, why don't you go ahead and start out. There's nothin' you can do here. State Police chopper's down with engine trouble. (horse whinnies) - [Police Dispatcher] 1041, 1042. (dispatcher chattering faintly) - [Dispatcher] 1041 for 1042. - [Dispatcher] Go ahead. (horse whinnies) - All right. All right. I'll meet you at the BLM Road to the 189 this afternoon. There's somethin' I wanna check out. They mighta dropped 'em off somewhere. You know, kids that age can be a royal pain in the saddle blanket. - Yeah. Never thought that'd be an asset. Hope you're right. - 1042. - Me too. - Go ahead. - Good luck. (car dinging) (engine rumbling) (horse whinnies) (searchers chattering) - No cartridges! - No cartridges! - You sure this is the way- - Yeah, yeah, I'm sure. - All right. (horse whinnies) - Move it up. You gonna check with Pat? - Oh, yeah. - [Officer] Let's go. - Pat, you there? - Come on. - Over. - Yeah, this is Jensen, over. Where did you think we were? The men and me, we're goin' around and back of the mountain. Over. - Be careful, Pat. These guys are dangerous. Over. - (chuckles) Well, so am I. Listen, we're gonna find her for ya. We might get a cougar or the wolf that's been botherin' my calves, too. Over. - Pat, Steve wanted me to remind you this is a national forest. You can't shoot the animals. (officer laughs) - I'll remember that, Page. - It'll take hours to get there. I don't understand why you're going. - Because I have to. Kerry's only 11 years old. She needs me there and so does Maggie. - But what are you gonna do? I mean, you're just gonna upset your dad. Besides, if he wanted you up there he woulda called. - I'm goin', Andy. (Andy sighs) I'm the closest thing to a mother either of them have right now and I'm not gonna let 'em down. (door latches) I'll call you when I get there. - Is your little sister as determined as you are? - I hope so. (engine rumbling) (birds chirping) (Casey sighs) - I smell food, real food. - (sniffing) He's right. I smell somethin' cookin'. - It's them. - [Casey] Your dad? - No, the criminals. We must be headed straight for 'em. Want some breakfast? - No more roots. I can't eat 'em anymore. - You mean- - Yeah. - That's crazy, they're tryin' to kill us. - It's the last thing they expect. - What? - If we're quiet, they won't even know we're there. Then when they leave, we'll go the other way. - (sighs) I smell bacon. - I don't like it. We're in enough trouble already. (fire crackling) (gentle music) - Yes, yes. The main road outta here is down that way. That's where those kids are and that road is our ticket outta here. We pop those little creeps, flag a car down on the interstate and we're home free, blondie. (Jocko laughs) - Hey. Hey, Jocko, you remember that plan? You said we're gonna go on down to Mexico, right? Well, we know where the road is. Why don't we just take our money and head on down there? I'll get us some wheels. Search party probably lookin' for us by now. - Uh uh. They figured we headed for the border. Actually, we're lucky we came this way. Gives us a little breathin' room. (Jocko spits) What'd you put in there? (Jocko spits) Man, I wish we had some coffee. (gentle music) (bugs chirping) - [Duane] Don't you want some more? - Nah. Hey, clean up this mess will ya? I got some business. (Jocko speaking faintly) (liquid splashes) (birds chirping) (bugs chirping) (cup clattering) (engines rumbling) - You got a pretty big leak there. We're gonna have to replace the radiator. - How long will that take? - I don't know. Hey Bill, we got any Mustang radiators in the back? - Sorry, Bill, we're out of it. - Shit. - Best thing I can do is patch this one up. That'll take a couple of hours. - I don't have that much time. How far can I drive it like this? - 60, maybe 70 miles but you'll crack the block if you don't stall first. - Let me see, uh... Thanks. (hood slams) (engine rumbling) (birds chirping) (engines rumbling) (bugs chirping) - [Casey] I've gotta rest. (kids panting) - How far do you think we've gone? - Pretty far. What did you do to that gun? - I took the clip. My dad showed me once. Can't fire an automatic without the clip. - Good idea. Your dad's gonna be proud of you when you get home. - Maybe, huh? - Jeez Louise! Look at all this money! (gasps) Where'd that come from? - They musta stole it before they took the car. I think we're in big trouble. - What do you mean? We're already in trouble. - No, she's right. They're gonna be real mad about us takin' their money. They won't stop now. What if we leave the money? Maybe they won't follow us. - We gotta get outta here. (Simcoe growls) (gentle music) - (gasping) Look! - Don't worry, he won't hurt us. - What do you mean he won't hurt us? He's lookin' at us like we're his breakfast. - The evil one is coming. You must hide. (John gasping) Take the branches and cover yourself. If he approaches, you must be as still as the deer. (gentle music) (kids gasping) - Quick, they're coming. Casey, go up there with your backpack. Go, now! John, get your knife and cut two branches (panting). That one, that one. Hurry! Come on. Hurry! Okay, and that one. Yeah. (Kerry panting) Hurry! Okay. Grab your backpack. Come on. Yeah. (Jocko panting) - Oh, Jocko, I can't believe them kids took our backpack, man. All our money and everything. Gosh! What are we gonna do, huh? - They're here. - [Duane] What? (gun cocks) (Jocko panting) - They're here. I feel it. - Hey, Jocko, man, I found a 20. Look at this. (Duane panting) - Come on. This way. - What about... Oh. (kids sighing) - Oh, man. - Oh, that was close. - I didn't even hear 'em. How did you know? - [Kerry] You didn't see him? - See who? - The wolf. - Well, yeah, but what does that have to do with it? - He told me. - What? You talk to wolves? - Nevermind. We gotta get movin'. (clip thuds) (birds chirping) (bugs chirping) - No tracks. They musta doubled back. - Hey, hey, Jocko, look, there's a road over there. Hey, what do you say we just get outta here, huh? Just leave the kids. Come on, man. Let's take off. - What are you, nuts? (gun cocks) What are we gonna do without money, huh? They die. You got that? They die. - Okay. - Nothin' is gonna stop me from killin' 'em. (Duane gasps) Not you, not nothing. - Okay, Painter. Whatever you say, man. We'll kill the kids. (Duane panting) (Jocko spits) (engine rumbling) (pensive music) (gun cocks) - All right, you stay here and keep down. - Daddy, be careful. (pensive music) - Hold it! (Kathy gasps) (Steve gasping) - Did you know that I almost shot you? - My car stalled down the mountain. Don't be mad, Daddy. I had to come. - How the hell do you know where we were? - Your office. I bullied them into telling me where you were. - Don't ever do that again, ever! (Steve panting) (Steve exhales) We were just trying to figure out which way they're headed. - Well, there's somethin' familiar about this part of the mountain. - We used to come up here when you were in high school and I was about Kerry's age. - Yeah, that's right. We used to take a trail up here. It went down to the BLM Road and then it cutoff in what was the- - Coffee Canyon? - Coffee Canyon, that's it. - You think that's where they're headed? - I'm almost positive. Look at this. He blew the two front tires. Somebody sharpened these. - [Maggie and Kathy] Kerry. (Kathy chuckles) - Kerry (chuckles). All right, listen. I'm gonna call Page and tell him that we found the car. - Right. - Look, honey, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to yell. I'm glad you're here. - All right. - [Steve] Okay? - Okay. - All right. Just don't scare me like that ever again. - Okay (chuckles). - We'll find her in time won't we? - Did something happen between you two? You seem so, so guilty or something. I heard about the cleaners. That was just an accident. You were just in the wrong place at the wrong time, that's all. - It's not that. The kids were making fun of me and I said some horrible things to her, things I didn't mean, and now I'm afraid. - You're afraid that you're not gonna be able to tell her that you didn't mean 'em. Come here. (Maggie sniffles) Come here. Two things, Maggie. First, we all say things to people that we love that we don't mean. Remember when Mom and Dad used to make me take you places with me everywhere I went? I used to get so mad havin' you tag along with me all the time. I said some pretty horrible things to you back then. But did you ever, ever doubt that I loved you? - No, no. I guess not. But this is different. - It's no different. Look at me, Maggie. It's not any different at all, okay? - What's the second thing? - The second thing is that Kerry's gonna be all right. I can feel it but you have to feel it too, for her. For that little tag along that's been making you crazy just like you used to make me crazy. You believe me don't you, Maggie? - (exhales) I love you, Kath. Thanks for being here. (gentle music) (Casey speaking faintly) - I'm hungry, I'm tired. Come up here (indistinct). (Casey sighs) - Any idea how much farther? - Pretty far. We might be here tonight, too. - Another night? Oh! I'm gonna starve to death. - Shh! - They'll save you the trouble if they catch us. - Oh, can't we at least find something to drink? - There's some water up ahead. I'll show you. - Oh boy. - Good. Well, it won't be so bad, come on. Get up. (John groans) I swear you gained weight even up here, chubs. (Casey groaning) - Hey! Are you kidding? I'm shrinkin' away to nothin' and don't call me chubs, doofus! - All right, bowling ball. - Bean pole! - [John] (indistinct) lard. - [Casey] French fry. You're standin' in my mom's tablecloth. (crow caws) (gentle music) (searchers speaking faintly) - Over here, huh? (searchers speaking faintly) - Well, the minute they pick up the scent of that coyote, they'll be gone quicker than you can say coyote. - [Officer] Yeah? Well, next year I'll be better prepared. - Oh, well, you gotta be prepared all your life. - [John] Slug! - [Casey] Shut up! You know, I wonder if they make coffins in your size! - [John] Shut up! - [Casey] You shut up! (eagle calls) (gentle music) - There's a spring around the next bend near a clearing. - How do you know that? (gentle music) - I don't know exactly, I just do. - I gotta rest. - We better find that spring before we get dehydrated. - Well, I'm not waitin' for you, Casey. You'll just have to catch up. - Yeah, fine but I wish you wouldn't say ketchup. (Casey exhaling) (Casey screams) - Casey! (Casey screaming) (dramatic music) - I thought they were here. - What? Let me go first. I'm gonna get our bag with all our money and stuff. (pensive music) (clip clicks) (Casey screaming) (dramatic music) - [Casey] Whoa, whoa! - Get the branch. Hang on. Okay, I almost got it. - [Casey] (screams) Guys! - Hang on. You can help pull it. - [Casey] Pull back! - I can't hold on much longer. - We have to! - [John] He's too heavy. (Casey screaming) (pensive music) - [Casey] Help! Help! Help! (Casey screaming) Help! Help! Help! (Casey screaming) (dramatic music) Help me! - Whoa! - [Casey] Whoa! Whoa! (triumphant music) (Casey gasping) (Kerry sighs) - That decides it. - Decides what? - When we get back, you're goin' on a diet. - We thought you'd had it. - What happened? - I don't know. (Simcoe howling) (gentle music) - Oh, man. - Wait! (music continues) (wind whistling) You saved us. I wanted to thank you. Why did you run away? - You are of your world and I am from mine. I cannot take this form for very long. - But why am I the only one that sees you like this? - Because you are one with the earth and the earth is our mother and you are one of her children. Remember, remember the land as it was. (gentle music) (woodpecker tapping) Remember our people, living free, not just existing. No laws of man, only laws of Mother Earth. Our people hated war, so we came to this place high in the mountain. We hunt, we lived from the land and we protect the land as she protects us. We grow old, we die, our children carry on. The white settlers came, building cities below but not up here. Generations later, our children left for the easy life in the white cities. Many came back here. Now all are dead. I was commanded to be the guardian, and I obeyed. You were a child of this land long ago and now you can help me. One day, maybe they will see me as you do. One day, they may understand as you do. - Does my father understand? - Your father's a human being, protector of land. He is beyond the age of belief but when he was your age I spoke to him as I speak to you now and I called him Opotto. It means searcher. He remembers what he saw but not me as I should be. (triumphant music) - They're back! - Hurry! - This is no time to be communing with nature. Murder Incorporated is after us, remember? - Whoa. (Casey blows raspberry) Hi. - Hi. - You all right? - I'm wonderful. - Yeah, I'll go along with that. - Barforamo, will you guys move it? - He's right. We gotta get outta the open. - How long since I left you guys back there? - Just a few minutes, why? - It seemed like days ago. Come on. (birds chirping) (Simcoe panting) - [Casey] Which way? - This way. - It's like going hiking with Daniel Boone, but Kerry Boone. - Why don't you save your strength? - Hey, hey, your shoelace is untied. - Yeah right. (John groans) (Casey chuckles) - You know, you should listen to me more often. - I'll catch up. (birds chirping) (groans) Rats! Darn. (bugs chirping) - I'm still thirsty. Can we find that spring? (pensive music) - It's okay, kids. You won't be thirsty for too long. Where's the other one? - Whoa! - I think he, he's- - He's dead. He fell over the edge. - You know, it's kind of funny, we heard him screamin', too. Yep, God and I thought he was the lucky one. Now give me that knapsack, doughboy. - That won't work. John took the bullets. - Really? (clip clicks) It was nice of him to leave that clip on the ground just before he went over the edge. - You shoot that, the sound will carry for miles. The search parties will hear it. - Wait, what? - And you'll be done for. - You know, he got a point there, Jocko. - Shut up! What's kinda funny about these mountains, you can't exactly hear where the sound's comin' from, echoes and the like. Duane, get the knapsack and then fat boy's goin' over the edge just like his little friend. (pensive music) Do it or I'll waste ya! (music continues) (John screaming) - Look, he's not dead. (fist thuds) (shot firing) (Duane yells) (Jocko yells) - Come on! - Get off me! Those lousy kids! Get 'em! - Where'd that come from? - [Steve] Three or four miles that way. - Come on, we gotta hurry! - Oh, wait a minute, hold it. We're never gonna catch 'em on foot so why don't we head over to the mouth of Coffee Canyon and surprise 'em? - Makes sense. Jensen party, Jensen party, do you copy? Over. - I heard a shot a little while ago. It seemed like about a mile from here. Over. - Now, can you follow their trail while we drive over to Coffee Canyon? - Well, we'll try. Like I said, it's pretty brushy up here. Maybe we can cut him off. - We're on our way. Over. - Yeah, Henry, what's up? - Hey, there's signs out there on the curb. (dramatic music) (Casey yells) - [Jocko] Get 'em! (Casey screams) (dramatic music) (Casey grunts) - Shoot! - They're gaining on us! - [John] They're not slowing down. - The money, drop the money! - [John] Oh, yeah. - Come on! - Go, go, go, go, go, go, go! - [Jocko] Dad gone kids! (dramatic music) (John yells) - What are you crazy? - Where are you goin'? Get the money! - [Duane] What they throwin' it away for? (dramatic music) (John yells) - That's it! Stop! This kid's crazy! Over there, get it! - [Duane] It's comin' outta the trees like magic. - [Jocko] Just... (dramatic music) (Casey panting) (Casey coughs) - Haven't you learned anything today? I mean, you're so outta condition you could hardly run. Eat the jerky, it'll give you energy, not fat. You know, the Indians could live on that and water for months at a time. They call it (speaking in foreign language). - No wonder there's no more Indians around here anymore. - Yeah, so how far to go? - Coffee Canyon's right over the next ridge. I wonder. - Wonder what? - Get the map. - Hm? It must've fallen out. - Well, what are ya thinkin'? - Left of the big yellow stone fire, my dad had fire roads cut in the ridges so the trucks could get through. If we could find the one in the scepter- - We could cut off some distance. - Yeah and make sure we beat those creeps there. - I'd drink to that, if there was anything to drink. - [John] Yeah, so which way? - I'm not sure. (critter chittering) (gentle music) Let's try that way? (critter chitters) - Oh, yeah right. - [John] Okay. - Hey, can't we wait just a few more minutes? Please? - We're gonna run outta time, Casey. You wanna spend another night here? (gentle music) (birds chirping) - You guys go ahead. I'll just catch up in a couple minutes, okay? - [Kerry] Whatever. (gentle music) (birds chirping) (pensive music) - You eat my last Ding Dong fatso and I'll put a hole in your head. (dramatic music) Mm. - Can I have some? (gentle music) (thunder rumbling) - Yeah, well those kids... Those kids could be dead by then. How 'bout the National Guard? - [Sheriff] I don't know, maybe I could get you some more men. - I'll take all the men I can get. What I want is a helicopter. - Well, don't worry 'bout it. We'll find 'em. - Just how good is your girl in the woods? - You gotta remember, she's only 11. - Well, my son's more of an indoors kid. Books and computer games and stuff. I mean, I have a hard enough time gettin' him outside to play sports much less campin'. I mean, I've tried but just, I haven't had much luck. - (chuckles) You can drive yourself crazy tryin' to think of what you want your kids to be. Just when you think you got 'em figured out they'll surprise you. - I guess you're right. - Jensen's on the horn. - It's Page, go ahead. - Yeah, he's givin' us the slip. - What do you mean, their tracks just vanished? - Well, you might say they vanished and we're comin' in. After all, it's gonna be dark pretty soon and we're not gonna be able to see anything. After all, we're not Indians (chuckles). Oh. - That's okay. - Sorry, I'm sorry. Sorry, Henry. Well, most of us here aren't Indians. - Half the time I can't see in the daylight anyway. - Do you have to come in? - Look, like I said it's gettin' dark and this front that's comin' in doesn't look too good either, I tell you that. It's got rain in it and maybe some lightening. We don't wanna take a chance. The men and I are comin' in. We can start this thing over tomorrow. - Roger, out. - What you want me to do? - We can take another party up there and try to meet Jensen on his way down. I've gotta get outta here and do somethin'. - Then lets do it. I'm goin' with ya. (dramatic music) - Come here, mop head. Which way did they go? - Over there. - You better be right. (Casey whimpers) Move it. (thunder rumbling) (gentle music) - Man, where is he? (sighs) Think we should go back for him? - I'm thinking we never should have left him. (gentle music) - Ah, there he is. - Quick, let's hide! (pensive music) - Fatso, I'm growin' real tired of this. All right, look, come here! You better be right about this, you hear me? You'd better be right! Get outta here. (thunder rumbling) (pensive music) - Come on, man. You know, you were right for tellin' him where they are. He's kinda crazy. - You're tellin' me. (head thuds) - Now what? - Well, we'll keep him in sight. The fire road can't be too much farther. - But how are we gonna get him away from them? - Hm. Maybe they'll stop and rest. We'll get ahead of 'em. (thunder rumbling) (rain pattering) - I need a rest. - Hey, Jocko, man, can we take a break man? Take a little rest? - What's the matter, is tubby slowin' you down? - No, no, no, I just need a little break, that's all. - (sighs) Yeah, this little sprinkle will only be a few minutes. All right, take five. - Hey. (pensive music) (thunder rumbling) (rain pattering) (twig snaps) (dramatic music) What was that? - I just threw a rock. I just threw a rock. - Look, porky, you're gettin' on my nerves. - Hey, hey, Jocko, man, Jocko, Jocko, come on. He's just a little fat kid, man. He's just playin', that's all. Look. - Well, quit playin'. - It's all right, he's just jokin' around, buddy. He's just jokin' around. (Duane exhales) (pensive music) (dramatic music) (thunder rumbling) (rain pattering) - It's gettin' cold. Are you sure this'll work? - Yes. Well, I don't know. It worked for the Indians. Work faster. It'll help keep you warm. - How come you turned into Pocahontas as soon as we got to this mountain? (gentle music) - Come on, John. We have to hurry. (pensive music) - Kid, take off. - What? - Take off, quick. - Hey! (Duane chuckles) What are you two talkin' about? - Oh, I was just sayin' we oughta get goin' that's all. (Casey groaning) - All right, get up! We're wastin' time here. Let's go find your little friends. - Move. (Casey groans) (pensive music) - Here, let me have it. (kids grunting) (dramatic music) Almost got it. Oh. - There. (gentle music) You know, you're pretty strong. (gentle music) - They're gonna be back here soon. We gotta get goin'. - Yeah, come on. - Okay, I'll take this. - Come on. You got it? - I think so. - This way. - Okay, whoa. (John grunts) (dramatic music) (pensive music) (birds chirping) - [Duane] Hey, what's the matter, Jocko? - [Jocko] I don't know. Somethin'. - Now! (dramatic music) (Jocko yells) - Yes! All right! - Duane, get the gun! Get the gun, you idiot! - Come on! - [Duane] You kids hold it, hold it right there. - Cut me down! I'm gonna tear those kids apart. (pensive music) Cut me down, Duane, now! - Come on! - Come on, come on, come on. - You let 'em get away you moron! You let 'em get away you stupid idiot! (rope snaps) (Jocko grunts) (pensive music) - Come on, man. - Get your hands off me! You're worthless! Now, come on. We gotta get those kids and grab the money! (dramatic music) Come on. - Faster, Casey! - I'm trying! - Run like you've never run before! (Casey groans) (dramatic music) Come on! Simcoe, help us! - What? - Nevermind, keep running. (dramatic music) - I can't make it! (John groans) - Come on, Casey! (pensive music) - I can't make it. - Yes, you can, come on! - [Kerry] Yes, you can! Get up! - No, I can't! Look, you guys gotta go without me. - We're not leaving you. - Yeah, we all make it or none of us make it. - Let's go. (dramatic music) (Simcoe howling) - Hey, there he is. - Huh? (horse whinnies) - There's that critter that's been eatin' my stock. (gun cocks) (eagle calls) (dramatic music) Goodbye, Mr. Critter. (eagle calls) (gentle music) - You had a shot. Why didn't you take it? - I can't explain it. - I told ya, this is a sacred mountain. - Don't remind me. (gentle music) (upbeat dramatic music) (Simcoe howls) (music continues) (Duane panting) - Come on, this way. We'll cut 'em off. - I can do it, I can do it! (shots firing) (kids screaming) (pensive music) - That way. - No, Daddy, it was this way. - I want you and you to stay here, you got me? - You stay here. (dramatic music) - Jocko, man, what are you doin'? Somebody's bound to have heard them shots, man. Look, forget the kids and let's just get outta here, man, come on. - I'm gonna splatter these brats right now. - No, don't do it. - Shut up! (gun cocks) (pensive music) (Jocko chuckles) (music builds) (eagle calls) (triumphant music) - Yes! - No! (pensive music) (men grunting) No! (Duane grunts) (dramatic music) (men grunting) (John yells) (gun thuds) (head thuds) (fist thudding) (Jocko yells) (Casey yells) (Jocko grunting) - [Casey] I got him, get him (laughs)! - Hold it! (Casey yells) (shot firing) - [Steve] This way. (Casey yells) - I said, hold it! (pensive music) (triumphant music) (air whooshing) (music continues) You, get over there with your friend. Casey, give him your hankie. - But it's dirty. - That's okay, so is he. (pensive music) (gentle music) (birds chirping) - Kerry! (dramatic music) - [Kerry] Kathy! (Jocko yells) - Let her go! - What are you gonna do, kid, shoot me? (Kathy gasping) (pensive music) I didn't think so. You ain't got the guts. - Let her go! - All right, you give me that gun and I'll let your friend go. - Kerry, I'm open for suggestions here. - If you don't give him the gun he'll kill my sister. - If you do he'll shoot us all. (John panting) (gentle music) - You don't have the guts to try. - I'm goin' in now. - If you move in now they'll kill 'em. - What if I don't move in? - Come on, even trade. (Kathy gasping) - Hand it over. - You give me that gun, I'll let her go. (Kathy gasping) (pensive music) - Yeah (chuckles). Yeah, yeah. - I can't wait any longer. - He's up to somethin'. (clip thuds) (Kathy gasps) - No! (gun clicking) - Let's go. (dramatic music) (Jocko yells) - Stop! (Jocko yells) - Go away! (Jocko yells) - Get the clip! - Get him! - Give me the... No! - [Steve] Hold it now! Drop it now! (Jocko yells) - Get down. - You all right? Sweetheart. (Kathy sobbing) Oh, God. Come here, honey. - Daddy, I love you. - I love you too, sweetheart. I was so worried. - Cattleries are always late. - Are you crazy trying a stunt like that with a gun? - Well, it seemed like a good idea at the time, Dad. - Just about the bravest thing I ever saw. (gentle music) (girls laughing) - Uncle Pat! - Kerry, Kerry! (Pat laughs) Are you all right? - Yes, I'm all right but I had a lotta help. - [Casey] What about me? - Come here, come on. Come here (laughs). - The mountain protected us giving us shelter, food, 'cause we knew enough to respect it. We didn't try to change it to suit us. We did the changing. There's no reason each and everyone of you can't enjoy spending time there and when you go, you'll find that everyone of us is tied to the land. By that I mean it's in our blood going back as far as there have been people. It's really nice to remember where we came from. Thanks. (all applauding) - We have time for a few questions. Yes, do you have a question? - I have a question for John. How do you know what to do when he picked up the crook's gun? - Well, I guess it's 'cause my dad's a police officer. Shootin's somethin' we used to do together and I guess we'll be doin' again. He taught me a lot about firearm safety. - I guess he also taught him about courage too, 'cause John showed it every step of the way. - Yeah, we really kicked their butts! (students laughing) (gentle music) (all applauding) - I read that you had help from a wolf. What about the legend? - Now about the legend of an Indian protector who takes the form of a wolf. I'm not saying the story isn't true, and I'm not saying it isn't false. I will say that there was something about the place that brought out the best in the three of us. (students applauding) (students cheering) (gentle music) - [Simcoe] One day, perhaps the others will understand. We are part of the Earth and it is part of us. The water that moves through the streams and rivers is not just water but the blood of our ancestors. The waters murmur the voice of my father's father. We know the white man does not understand our ways. But this is the heritage that we who have gone before pass to you. Guard this trust well.
