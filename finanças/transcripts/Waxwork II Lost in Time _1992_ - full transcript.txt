[SCREAMS] Oh! Oh, my goodness! [SQUEAKING] It's over, Sarah. It's finally over. [WHIMSICAL MUSIC] [ENGINE REVVING] A cab. Come on. Taxi! 315 Rosebud. [FUNERAL DIRGE MUSIC] So, uh, pretty big blaze back there. Really? We hadn't noticed. What are we going to do, Mark? We're just gonna pretend like nothing happened. Go home, go to sleep, get up, and go to class. But what if one of those creatures got out? How? We burned that place down to the ground. Nothing could have escaped that inferno. I just hope you're right. We're here. [WHIMSICAL MUSIC] Try and get some sleep. We'll talk about things in the morning. Okay. [TV NOISE] [FLOORBOARDS CREAKING] Well, well, well, if it ain't Cinderella. I can explain, Stepfather. I... Shut up! You know what your mother said to me before she died? - No, sir. - She said... [HIGH-PITCHED VOICE] "Take care of my precious daughter." [REGULAR VOICE] Precious-frickin' daughter! It's 3 o-friggin' clock in the morning! - You don't understand. - Oh, I understand. You've been out hanging around with that bunch of frat-brat college idiots again. Shit! Look at that dress! That was your mother's favorite! Go and get cleaned up and go to bed. [MUSIC] [SIGHS] I told you to go to bed. I don't want to see your face till morning. I'll deal with you then. Now get out of here. You're pushing it, Sarah. Now you better get out of here. I'm warning you! [CHOKING] Sarah! Sarah! Let go of him! [GASPING] Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah— [SCREAMING] [RUMBLING] [SCREAMING] [CRYING] Mark, you said it was over! You said it was over! [ELECTRICAL BUZZING] MAN: I'm afraid the facts speak for themselves, good people of the jury. This girl's loving, caring stepfather... A man, I might add, who one neighbor described as a "kind, generous person"— I told her not to use the hand story. We could have built a great manslaughter case. MAN: ...when this vicious, cold-blooded, shameless act took place! And what is her only defense? Ladies and gentlemen, empty excuses. And she blames it... on a hand. A hand that the accused claims followed her home from a wax museum which she admittedly was at when it very mysteriously burned to the ground... - killing— - Objection, your honor! My learned colleague has forgotten the case yet again. Does the burning down of the wax museum have any bearing whatsoever on whether the accused killed her stepfather or not? Your Honor, the latest body count at the Waxworks is 200. 200 people. 200 human lives. And I think that if this defendant, the accused, is in any way involved... Objection! Objection sustained. Please delete that last remark from the record. Sarah didn't kill anyone, you idiots! It was the waxworks themselves! - They came alive! - Order! I saw it! You gotta believe— Let go of me! She's telling the truth! Do you understand me? She's telling the truth! Just leave her alone! She didn't do anything, I tell you! Come on! Let go! [SOMBER MUSIC] [CAMERA SHUTTERS FLASHING] [REPORTERS TALKING INDISTINCTLY] Silly question, but... how do you feel? Look, Sarah. It's gonna work out. It's got to. Cabbie, 64 Wargrave Road, please. Thanks. Where? Sir Wilfred's. This is the only room we haven't checked. What are we supposed to be looking for? I don't know. He just told me to come here if there was ever any trouble. Good afternoon, Mark. - Afternoon, Sarah. - Sir Wilfred? Hope you're both doing well. Put it this way, if you're watching this, you're a darn sight better off than I am, 'cause I must be dead. Help yourself. I'm sure I'm not allowed to touch this stuff where I am. Always fancied a pair of wings, though. Won't have to travel around in this damn thing. Hopefully, we did destroy the Waxwork and killed all those creatures ending our Mr. Lincoln's chance of letting all that evil loose on the world, right? Well, sort of. If you two are here, it probably means that something has gone wrong, in which case... you're going to need all the help you can get if you want to continue the fight against evil. You may not know it yet, Mark, but I have left all this to you. - You did? - Yes. Most importantly, you have inherited your grandfather's and my secret collection of strange artifacts which we have collected in our many adventures through the supernatural. There may be something there that will help you in your quest. Adios and good luck! Wait! Aren't we supposed to— Ooh. Nearly forgot. How to get through the secret chamber? Just follow Alice through the looking glass. Ta-ta for now. [FILM REEL FLAPPING] Alice? Who the hell is Alice? Through The Looking Glass is the second Alice In Wonderland book, the one where she travels to another world through a mirror. A mirror. I don't see anything. [RUMBLING] Van Helsing? [MUFFLED SCREAM] [SQUEAKING] Hey, Sarah, look at this. What is it? It's a Cartagrian time door opener. Cartagrian? I don't know what it means. It must be some medieval expression or something. It says it was used by angels, both light and dark, to travel through time. So? So maybe if we went down to the remains of the Waxwork, we could use this to open one of Mr. Lincoln's time doors. You're joking. Why not? We've been in and out of time before. - But, Mark... - Listen, Sarah, if we don't find some evidence to support your story, one of two things is gonna happen. You're gonna rot in jail, or they're gonna give you the electric chair. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, but that's the way it is. We gotta do something about this. But remember what happened the last time. Forget the last time. This is gonna be different. How do you open this thing? [CLICK] Wow. Look at that. [MUSIC] Look! It even worked here! Come on! No, Mark! It's not the same kind of time door as in the last one! It's probably because it's in a different location. Mark, promise me we're not running! What have we got to lose? - Mark, I don't want to run! - Come on! Mark! Mark! Sarah! [SQUEAKING] [SCREAMING] [SQUEAKING] MAN: Catch the ball, son. There you go. That's it. Come on. Hi! Come on. It's time to come home to Mommy. Come on home, hon. Come on, honey. Come on. It's time to come home to Mommy. Please? [LOUD THUD] It's time to come home, Mark. [HEART BEATING] We did it, Sarah. We did it! Sarah? [POUNDING] [THUNDER] [DOORS CREAKING] Baron Von Frankenstein? Well, I... Yes? I am Victor Frankenstein. [THUNDER] And how may I help you, sir? I'm Herr Vogel, Burgomeister of Ingolstadt. Pleasure to meet you, Herr Vogel. Now please, it is far too late an hour for a social visit. Do state your business. All right, Baron, I will. There have been rumors in the village that there's something... Ooh. Elizabeth, please, go back to your chamber. Don't be too long, my darling. Sarah? Herr Vogel was just leaving. Isn't that right, Herr Vogel? [DOORS CREAKING] It's all right, Henry. Go with Felix. Felix? [GROWLS] [THUNDER] Let go! I saw the way you looked at the baroness! - Don't think the Baron doesn't know. - Let go! Let go! Feed him and clean his hay. [GROWLING] You know how the Baron hates the smell. [LAUGHING] [GROWLS] Excuse me? [GROWLS] Oh, you're hungry. You're hungry. Uhh... Okay, uh, I'm gonna find you something. Stay calm. I'm gonna get you something. [GROWLS] What the hell am I gonna feed him at this hour? Hey, I know. I know. We could send out for a pizza. - [GROWLS] - Oh! Okay! Okay! Okay. Okay. Uh... I'm gonna... I'm gonna find you something. [GROWLS] Is that what he feeds you? Slop coming up. Augh! [GROWLS] I-I can't feed you that. It's disgusting. Okay. Okay. This should be better. Frankenstein's notebook. [GROWLS] [GROWLS] [THUNDER] [FELIX LAUGHS] FELIX: He has much trouble running the village. Why is he the Burgomeister? He can't even control a few peasants! [GLASS SHATTERING] Wake up. Wake up. Sarah. - [MUFFLED SCREAMS] - Shh! No! No, no, no. It's okay. It's okay. It's me. It's okay. It's okay. Henry, what are you doing here? If the baron finds us... Sarah, don't do this to me. It's me, Mark, remember? Remember the Waxwork? The court case? Look, you've been affected by the time leap. But you must be strong! Mark. Mark. What happened? Where are we? You believed in all of this. It possessed your mind. Come on, let's get back to the 20th century. But the evidence. Frankenstein's notebook. A step-by-step guide on how to reanimate dead flesh... And you should see what's in his cellar! You're serious. Think about it. If we can reanimate dead flesh, then the prosecution's case is out the window. But if you don't like the book idea, we can always try and take the monster. Now come on. [THUNDER RUMBLING] [MUSIC] The hallway is the first place I remember appearing. There should be a time door down there. All I can remember is a falling sensation. You don't think maybe we should have prepared all this a little more, do you? Don't worry. It's gonna turn out fine. Shh. The time door must be around here somewhere. [POUNDING ON DOORS] [CROWD YELLING] Elizabeth? But, Victor... You slut! With Henry Clevell, my best friend! Have you no shame? Maybe if you spent more time with me instead of that 8-foot slab of brain-damaged flesh, I would not have to seek pleasures elsewhere, would I? But with him? Now just a second here! [POUNDING ON DOORS] I warned you, Baron. Now we must ask that you turn over the monster peacefully, or we must take him by force. Never! After him! [CROWD YELLING] Open the door, you idiot! Felix! Unchain the monster! Sarah! Sarah... don't let us down. Remember who you really are. Elizabeth... Don't Elizabeth me. Sarah, there's a time door over... [GROWLS] Mark, look out! Behind you! [LAUGHING] Don't worry. Remember, Sarah? Back in the Waxwork? If you don't believe in this then it isn't really happening. Here, I'm gonna show you. Come on! Come on, hit me. - Huh? - Hmm? Mark, I don't know if this is such a good idea. - Hit me. - Huh? Come on! Hit me! [LAUGHING] [THUD] Don't listen to a word I say! Just run like hell to the time door! In the wall! Come on! Augh! Let go of him, you beast! Forget about me, you fool! Run to the time door! Quick! Kill Henry! You piece of rotting cartilage! Did you hear what I said? Kill him! Kill him! Are you listening to me, you ugly freak of death? Do it now! I made you! I gave you life! Felix! Kill him. Uh-uh! [SCREAMING] Felix, help me. Aah! Aah! Aah! [GROWLS] Felix. I'm sorry. Come on. [GROWLS] It's here. Mark, I don't know. Sarah, we have to go. The book! [GROWLS] No! No! Eww! [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] The time door! It's gone! [DOOR CRASHING OPEN] [GROWLS] [ELECTRICAL BUZZING] Aah!

Then how come you told us it was safe to bring that fucking cargo aboard in the first place? It was a calculated guess! I didn't know. A deserted shuttle lost in space over 200 years ago?

Well, we could just... Whoa! [THUD] Are you all right? Yeah. [FANCIFUL MUSIC] That's it! What? The diamond underneath the diamond. You found her, Douglas! Quickly. Read the body the committal.

I'm fine. How did you find me? Trust me, it wasn't easy. Have you got the book? - The book? - Frankenstein's notebook. Um... Well, the Loch Ness monster kind of ate it. - It did? - Yes. But I did get something great from Haiti. You're gonna love this. Look. What is it? What is it? It's a voodoo petro coffin for bringing the dead back to life. I've got an instruction booklet and the eye of newt, magic crystals, and everything. Wait until the prosecution gets a load of this.

[EXPLOSION] SARAH: Where are we? I don't know, but you look stunning. I'm afraid I've lost the time door opener. Great! Then we're never gonna find our way back home. Why didn't I stay and face up to something for once in my life? The only thing you would have faced would have been the electric chair. Sorry. China told me James, Gemma, they all died in that Waxwork. So that's it: guilt. You think you're responsible for their deaths? Sarah, what happened in the Waxwork was not your fault. Then I'll be found not guilty. If the world was fair, yes, but it isn't. And face it, Sarah. No one's gonna believe your stupid story about dead flesh walking, not without some evidence to prove it. [HORSES APPROACHING] [HORSES WHINNY] [HORSES WHINNY] Stop it! Let her go! Has Scarabis also taken the one you loved? - Scarabis? - Yes. The one they call The Master. He took my Lenore, you know, many, many moons ago. It was shortly after that we found her horribly rotten and abused body in Bedlow's Swamp. The Master is no mortal. He is the Devil himself. Where can I find this Scarabis? The Castle of Poe, a place of much evil. I must go. Which way is the castle? Please, you must tell me. Go east through the forest. You will find it. Thank you. Boy. [TRUMPET FANFARE] Take this. I have no use for it anymore. I couldn't. Strike once for Lenore and for all the others who have suffered under the rule of The Master. I will... I promise. May God go with you. [GROANS] [LAUGHS] I'm bored. So bloody bored. So tell me. How do you think I'm going to look on the throne of England? Absolutely divine, Master. That will have to change. - Practice. - Practice? Your Majesty. Say, George, "Your Majesty." Y-Y-Your... M-M-M-Majesty. Better. Yes. What is it? The Sergeant is here. He's with Lady Madeline, sir. What? Send them in. Send them in! What is the meaning of this? We found her ladyship in the woods, sir. Is it true, Madeline? She was with that boy Philip again. [SLAP] I'm sorry. Forgive me. I... I... I... I could never hurt you. It's just that tonight is so important. But I don't want to marry the king. You will do as you are told, Madeline. Do you understand? Do you? Yes, my brother. Good. Good. With Philip, you say? We should have killed that meddling boy a long time ago. Well, it would only have made Madeline more difficult. We'll do it when the time is right. You don't think that they... Well, you know, it's a distinct possibility, Your Majesty. I want her checked. [CHANTING MUSIC] MAN 1: It's nice out today, isn't it? [MEN LAUGHING AND TALKING] So anyway, not far to the castle, now, eh? MAN 2: Here, give me that. This better be our last delivery for that bastard before lunch. Here, watch what you're saying, lad. Even here he's hung, drawn, and quartered for less than that. I'm not afeared of no man. - Boo! - Oh! - [LAUGHING] - Very funny. Not scared, eh? [LAUGHING] Here, did I ever tell you the one about... Ahem. Well? Virgin. That's a relief. The future Queen of England must be pure. As a rose, Your Majesty. Good. Send her to her quarters. [LAUGHS] How many soldiers are there in this place? Sarah? Sarah! Wake up. Oh, they must have drugged you. Come on. We gotta get you out of here. This place is like a maze. It's got mirrors everywhere. It took forever to find you. This way. Oh! Watch out! [FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING] Oh! Come on! Okay, this way. Come on. [GIGGLING] [DOOR SHUTTING CLOSED] Careful. [CHANTING] [CHANTING] [GROWLING] [GROWLS] [SCREAMING] [CHANTING] No! No! Ohh. [GROWLING] Sarah. Huh? Mark. You remembered. How could I forget? Hmm. Out! Out! Out! This Scarabis guy is up to some pretty bizarre stuff. You should have seen what happened in here while you were out cold. I wonder if maybe... No, it's not any of our problem anyway, is it? [MUSIC] I mean, it's not our problem what kind of diabolical scheme he's planning to unleash upon civilization... is it? Did you know the king is supposed to ask for my hand in marriage at dinner tonight? Fascinating. Excuse me? Black Magic. This guy must be pretty good. I'll spare you the gory details, but if he's done what it says in here, he should be able to change shape with any living thing within a given proximity. Now, why would he want to do that? Mark, it's none of our business. History has worked itself out without us, and we know that because we studied it in class 700 years from now. So please, let's just find some kind of evidence and figure out how we're going to get back to the 20th century before one of these worlds possesses us forever, okay? All right. Okay. You know, sometimes I think you actually enjoy all this hero stuff. - What... - I mean— Well, well, well! If it isn't Romeo and Juliet. [LAUGHING] Take him to the dungeon. Let go of him! And you, my dear, we really do need to talk. What are you going to do with him? That, my dear Madeline, depends on you. - Me? - Yes. You see, if your brother is to ever achieve real happiness, then you must willingly marry the king. And a happy brother is a happy George. - But what's that to Mark? - Who? - Philip. - It's simple. You see, if you stop thinking with your pussoir and be a good girl then I will make sure that Philip escapes. Yes. Free. To a different country, of course. And don't tell me I'm supposed to trust you. Do you have a choice? Your perennial unhappiness... for your lover's life. This nonsense is gonna make me later for dinner. What have you done with the girl? Young love. Hey! Wait! Come back! They say a man can last five days. Unless, of course, the rats get to you first. [KISS] Sweet dreams.

I'm not allowed to tell you too much. In fact, this is the last time your grandfather or I are ever allowed to help you. - Grandfather? - Yes. I think you met him earlier. The beggar. He was... Exactly! I'm afraid from here on in, you're on your own. On my own in what? When you first used Solomon's locket, you opened a doorway to another universe, Cartagra. Cartagra. A place where the true battle between good and evil is played out for eternity. I still don't... Let me try putting this in a more, oh, earthly way. Sarah and you have actually stumbled into God's Nintendo game. No. Oh, yes! Where He and the Devil fight it out, using their various time warriors as different characters, forever trying to tip that delicate balance one way or another. And if evil ever wins one of these battles, then... The results in the real world are more than horrific. Earthquakes, floods, war. Then this isn't real. You tell me. Ah! There. Thank you. - Is there a way back? - Yes. But be careful. Even though each locket enables its owner to indefinitely open time doors around Cartagra, it can only be used to open the main door, the one that joins the two universes, twice. You've already opened it once. That's okay. We only need the trip back. Before you do go rushing back to your world, Mark, remember, it is one of the greatest privileges ever to be chosen as a time warrior. You mean He... I mean, God wants me to be a time warrior? Maybe you're one already, Mark. And Sarah? What about her? I think she has too much left to settle in her own world, don't you? But what... I know. And I'm sure when the time comes, you will make the right decision. Well, I have to go now. What? Sir Wilfred, how do I get the locket to open the main door again? Take a minute to think about it, then guess. [CHANTING MUSIC] Wine! More wine the table 'round! My liege. Are you all right, Your Majesty? Are you all right? It's all right. He just fainted.

Take him to one of the castle rooms. Give him some food and drink. I would like to hear more. As you wish, Your Majesty. Your crest ring. Where is your crest ring? Ring? What are you talking about? Tell your men to follow me. Well, follow him, then! Follow him! [GUARDS TALKING] Don't let this man out of your sight. Have you gone mad? I'm the king! I shall have your head for this. You heard me. But... but... But he's the king. Hello? H-H-Hello? Now to make sure The Master retains your identity forever. Hey, Torquemada. Huh? Try picking on someone your own size. Mon Dieu! - Out of my way! - After him! You all right, Your Majesty? Yes. Yes. Who is this brave young man? He and his friend uncovered Scarabis' plan to take over the throne. I can't thank you enough. It was an honor. Your Majesty. Your Majesty. Where is Scarabis? The man I asked you to hold? Where is he? Uh... he left. I mean, he was the king, wasn't he? I mean, I couldn't have stopped him... could I? Just tell your men to take the castle. Hold everybody, including the king. Do as he says. Crikey. [MUSIC] And release the prisoners. KING: All of them. They fight for England. I don't know how to thank you. No problem. Hmm. The Master must have a secret escape somewhere. [SWORD FIGHTING, YELLING] Ow! Open the altar. Of course, Your Majesty. [SCREAMING] Scarabis, let the girl go! [LAUGHING] [PUNCHES LANDING] Mark. Mark, speak to me. Get away from that idiot. My future wife kneels to nobody. Future what?! I'm your sister. But when I became king, you would have also been my wife. And together, we'd have had pure, beautiful children to rule this country with. You're—You're sick! Moi? Yes, you! You sadistic, egotistical, incestuous, blood-thirsty pervert! Does this mean you don't love me? You bet it does, brother of mine. This does throw a different light on the situation. George. Kill the bitch. Totally. Come on! Uhh! Smish smack boom! I'm okay. Uhh! [PUNCH LANDING] One thing before I kill you. Which village would breed such idiotic, futile persistence? - America. - Of course. America? Is that north or south of London? - It's the future. - Kind of west. Then let's hope no other of your fellow villagers dare venture east. You ain't seen nothing yet. [SWORD UNSHEATHING] To the death. [ELECTRICAL BUZZING] [BEAKERS BUBBLING] Ooh! Ah. [GRUNTS] [WHIMSICAL MUSIC] Huh? [ELECTRICAL BUZZING] [80s POPPY MUSIC] [GROWLS] Who the hell are they? Whoever they are, they're bad. [SINGING, INDISTINCT] [GIGGLES] Hello, luv. Fancy a little naughty... Oh! [SCREAMING] [LAUGHS] [ELECTRICAL BUZZING] [ROCK OPERA MUSIC] [WOMAN SCREAMS] [WOMAN SCREAMS] [PUNCH LANDING] [WOMAN SCREAMS] [OLD-TIMEY SYNTH MUSIC] [ELECTRICAL BUZZING] MAN: The monster! Run! [SCREAMING] Ohh! [ROARS] Oh, no! They say that the moment of death... is more pleasurable... than the most intense orgasm imaginable. Do you like to be kissed when you release? [THUD] Uhh! Now I'm gonna bleed you like a pig. [DOORS EXPLODING OPEN] [GROWLS] - Mark, are you all right? - I think so. - The hand. It ran in here. - Over there. Mark, we have to get out of this hell. I want to, but I don't know how. Look. [ELECTRICAL BUZZING] Watch out! The pods are hatching! [ELECTRICAL BUZZING] See? It's just opening the time doors that float around Cartagra, not the one that's gonna take us home. There has to be a way to trigger it. [FANCIFUL MUSIC] Well, the raven said... Sir Wilfred told me to... take a minute to think about it and then guess. Said the Red Queen. It's another line from... Through The Looking Glass. Come on! This could be our last chance to get back to our own world. If anything happens— We haven't got a choice. Thank you. For what? For getting you into this mess? For everything. I mean it. It's working! Come on! [ADVENTUROUS MUSIC] [GROWLS] Go, damn you! Go! Come on! [ELECTRICAL BUZZING] What happened? I don't know! The door must be a lot smaller now. Maybe it can only take one of us. No! We go together or nothing! No, you'd never be happy here. Forget whatever I said before. I'd be happy anywhere with you. You're so wrong! You have to work out Sarah in your own world. And now you've got the evidence to do it! - Go on! Get out of here! - Mark, no! Go on! Scram! Get out of here! Mark, no! I love you, Sarah. Mark? Mark, where are you? [SQUEAKING] [SOFT MUSIC] And with this new evidence, and as incredible as this seems, one can no longer think that without a shadow of a doubt the accused was responsible for any of the events that occurred on that fateful night. Has the jury reached a decision? MAN: Yes, we have, Your Honor. Does the jury find Sarah Brightman guilty or not guilty of the crimes accused? Not guilty. [AUDIENCE CHEERING] [MUSIC] Ms. Sarah Brightman? I'm James Westbourne, Westbourne Delivery Service. We're the oldest delivery company in the world. We started out in Europe, you know. Oh, if you'll just sign here, please. Now this letter has been at our company ever since my oldest relative can remember with instructions to hand it to you on this day... After the verdict, of course. [WHIMSICAL MUSIC] Well... guess I've done my part. Good-bye. [REPORTERS TALKING, INDISTINCT] Sarah, what are you going to do now? What are you going to do now, Sarah?
