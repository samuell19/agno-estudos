I forgot the opening line. Enough of that, Hobbs. Flight of birds, the flight of man... Man's similarity to birds, birds' similarity to man. These are the subjects at hand. And we will deal with them for the next hour or so and hope that we draw no conclusions, elsewise, the subject shall cease to fascinate us. And alas, another dream would be lost. There are too few. In these words, the German poet Goethe... ...expressed man's desire to fly. "How I yearn to throw myself into endless space and float above the awful abyss." Man, incontestably the most advanced creature, has only to observe the flight of birds to realize the weight of the earth's imprisonment. And so, the desire to fly has been ever-present in the mind of man. But the reality has been long in coming. Has man truly realized his dream? To answer that, we must isolate the dream. Was the dream to attain the ability to fly? Or was the dream the freedom that true flight seemed to offer man? We may also touch on the mortal damage man is doing to birds' environment in comparison to the piddling nuisance birds cause man. It may someday be necessary to build enormous environmental enclosures to protect both man and birds. But if so, it is questionable whether man will allow birds in or out, as the case may be. ♪ Oh, say can you see ♪ ♪ By the dawn's early light ♪ ♪ What so proudly we hailed ♪ ♪ At the twilight's last gleaming ♪ ♪ And bright stars ♪ ♪ Through the perilous fight ♪ ♪ O'er the ram... ♪ What key?

Good morning, Mr. Wright. Good morning, Birdie. Get that away from me! I don't trust your big ears, you dirty pinko. Here's your money, sir. - I don't have to count it, do I? - Oh, no. No, sir. - It's all here, isn't it, Birdie? - Oh, yes, sir. Every last bit. - Yes, sir. - Yeah. What is that? Huh? Yeah! Look at that! Look at that! Two big Georges right there! Who threw that tomato? The investigation continues at this hour into the mysterious death of well-known Houston socialite Miss Daphne Heap, the soprano who sings the national anthem... ...at the Astrodome before every ball game. Put that window down, McCloud. McCloud, you don't listen to me. Now, there are two things I want to tell you, not only about your driving which is just deplorable, but also about your deportment which is also... Here's an important bulletin just handed me. The latest development in that trio of mysterious murders in Houston came today from the office of Haskell Weeks, the longtime friend of the city told KILT reporters that he's bringing in a special investigator from the San Francisco Police Department. A man identified only as Frank Shaft. Well, kid, that's it. I'm closing this place down, McCloud. The black part's a conspiracy, they're moving in. Did you see that grenade? There were buckets of grenades in the living room. That kamikaze... Get off the grass! McCloud! Get me off! McCloud! Oh, McCloud! Get Spiro on the phone, that's what I'm gonna do right now. Get me out of here. Be careful now, McCloud. Easy! Easy! Easy, McCloud! Easy, now! Up! One by one! Oh, I just dropped a steamer through the hoop. This is Karl Williams, KILT news. Quarter past the hour now and time for the Hudson & Harrigan and the cure minute, sir. How about a rebel yell then... What may prove to be an important clue was turned up by police when it was discovered Miss Heap's prize pigeons were apparently released by the killer. Miss Heap's deep affection for the birds was well known throughout the southwest. Yes, everything seems to be in good shape. I'm very pleasantly surprised, Maybelline. Wait a minute. Just hold on. Wait a minute. Saunders: $24.32. Unpaid. Well, he died Tuesday, Mr. Wright. - He did? - Yes, sir. Well, I'm very sorry to hear that, Maybelline. But if Mr. Saunders did die on Tuesday, I can't do anything about that. He still owes me for a week's rent. That money's gonna have to come from someplace. What do you plan to do about it? Well, surely, not from me. Yes, from you! What do you mean not from you? There's money right there in your hands. - But this... - I want my money! - Give me my money! - This is my money! Look out! Where's my bird? No! No! Something's wrong. Take your bird. Get out of here. It's an invasion! A goddamn commie invasion! McCloud, put that window... Don't you ever do that when I'm talking to you. What do you mean putting that window up? Goddamn fag. You know something, McCloud? You are nothing but a fag. A goddamn faggot. 5,432... 5,433... 5,435... 5,439... Watch this. Hee, pup pup pup. Little old gumba, darling, come here. Didn't anybody ever tell you that you had a beautiful "doreemus." Ow! Mr. Wright! You... Turn on the television set. The television set's not working. McCloud, I wanna watch my program. I gotta watch Sesame Street. Now turn it on. Look! McCloud, on the hood! Bird doodoo! Bird doodoo! Stop the car, McCloud! Stop the car! Get that thing off of there. Get it off! Hurry up, McCloud! Hurry up! Wipe it off! It'll run right through the paint. Bird shit on the hood, God damn it. I should never have hired you this morning. Goddamn birds. McCloud, are you happy in your work? Well, you must think I have all the money in the world! You're fired! I don't give a damn! Don't tell me... get away from me. - Get out of my way! - Please! Get out of my way, you silly bitch. I'll mow you down! You yap, yap, yap! You're so full of bullshit... How do you do, ladies? All right, McCloud, let's move it. Easy down the chute, McCloud. Easy down. McCloud? McCloud! McCloud! Don't you ever lay a hand on my money. Ah... my money... McCloud... KILT news learned that Shaft is being flown into Houston entirely at Haskell Weeks' expense. The legendary super-cop from 'Frisco is due to arrive at Houston Intercontinental Airport only minutes from now. And we'll have a reporter there for on-the-scene coverage. ♪ Last thing you do is hear the jingle in your pocket ♪ ♪ When they sock it to you further down the line ♪ ♪ And all that funny money ♪ ♪ It won't get you milk and honey ♪ ♪ So ride ride ride Abraham, ride... ♪ Oh, do you have the number of the local Audubon Society? Luke McIntyre at Houston's Intercontinental Airport. We are stationed in the private and very exclusive executive jet terminal where Haskell Weeks' personal jet Silver Eagle Mark IV has arrived non-stop from the west coast with one of California's most famous detectives on board, San Francisco super-cop Frank Shaft. And our sources tell us Shaft is here to work on the recent rash of mysterious strangulation murders. Ah. The crested peacock. On the peacock, it is just that nature appears to have bestowed her treasures with the greatest profusion. Its size, imposing manner, firm tread and noble figure, the rich crest upon its head, its matchless plumage appearing to combine everything that can delight the eye. And contend to place it in our high esteem. Here's Shaft now disembarking. He's a striking figure. Turtleneck sweater, custom slacks, and I can tell you this. If keeping your cool and being totally composed makes for a better detective, then this Shaft is one whale of a cop. I hate to rush you, Lieutenant, but Captain Crandall is gonna get really pissed off at me. I mean, I was supposed to take you right over to his office as soon as you came in. I don't know how it is in San Francisco, sir, but here in Houston, Captain Crandall is head of homicide. And he rules that department with an iron fist and what he says really goes, sir. I don't even think he likes San Francisco, sir. Frank. Tell me about the third one, Johnson. That woman who was strangled. - Frank? - That's my name. Call me Frank, ok? Yes, sir. Do you mind if I use that phone to call Captain Crandall? - Tell him where we... - Tell me about that third one, Johnson. Ok. Her name was Daphne Heap, sir. And she was very well respected and admired in town. Her father was a great benefactor, gave us a couple hospitals. And a nice park. Well, she was quite a character, sir. You know, she used to sing the national anthem at all the ball games. You know the type, sir? Even had her own orchestra and everything. The unmated Song Thrush. The importance of song to a bird can be partly judged by the amount of time the bird devotes to it. However, one can, with almost equally good logic, assume that bird chorales were first used to release the nervous tension... Get out, you nigger bird! It was a mess, sir. You should've seen her. - Molested? - Molested? Sexually. Was she sexually assaulted? Oh, no. But she sure was a mess, sir. Miss Heap was found strangled at the formal palatial in River Oaks. She was sprawled among the bird of paradise plants dressed in a red, white and blue acrylic knit with flattering wing collar and matching imitating bird feather belt and those spangling red rhinestone shoes. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Astrodome, the eighth wonder of the world. My name is Suzanne Ferris and I'll be your tour guide for the next 45 minutes to an hour. So please feel free to ask questions at any time. And if you must leave, like to go to the bathroom or something, please notify me. By the way, where is the bathroom? Where is the bathroom? Well, there are bathrooms every 50 feet. But they're not really bathrooms, you know. They're... they don't have a tub or anything like that. All right, our first stop will be down in the Dome Skeller. It's 25 feet underground. And it's about the only place you can go that far underground in Texas and not strike oil. The Cassowary... the body of the Cassowary is extremely heavy and its wings are so short that it has no power to raise itself from the ground in flight. A bony protuberance forms on the top of the head. A sort of... helmet. Like the ostrich, this bird is not very delicate in its taste. All right, if you'll just please follow me, we'll be going down there right now. Oh, sir, do you have change for this... this half a dollar? Jesus Christ, how do you sleep around here? Well, you get used to that after a while. It's usually the heart guys that cause it. What guys? We got a couple doctors here who do transplants. They'll sit around and wait till a stiff dies the right way. For his heart, you know? Jesus Christ. Excuse me. You can get drinks and things later. Please stay with the tour. I'm sure you'll really like it up here. Y'all will get to hear something too. Like the scoreboard, even though it's so big, it's just operated by this small room that has a really complicated computer inside of it. I mean, the other day talked to a man... And they turned out some pretty interesting stuff. But just think if somebody really intelligent got hold of it, what they could do. I mean, it could probably work out some problems. Oh, look, it's Officer Ledbetter here. He just likes my tour a lot, I guess. And as you heard in our interview, Frank Shaft apparently is in Houston at the expense at the expense of Haskell Weeks to lend assistance to local police in their investigation of these unusual strangulation murders. Captain Crandall's gonna be awful angry when he finds out how long we're taking. Look, Johnson... it is Johnson, isn't it? Yes, sir. Frank. I mean Frank. Now, we're gonna be working together, right? Yes, sir. Uh, Frank. Ok, I want to tell you something about me. I don't much care how pissed off any desk cop gets. Got it? It's working stiffs like us that get the job done. Now, I want to go over to where that last guy lived. Abraham Wright, wasn't that his name? Yes, Frank, sir. Ok, we're gonna go over there and look around, Johnson. Just you and me. The partridge... The affection of partridges for their offspring is peculiarly interesting. They lead them out to feed, the point out to them the proper places for their food and assist them in finding it by scratching the ground with their feet. They frequently sit close together, covering the young ones with their wings, and from this protection, they are not easily roused. Watch out for these big steps because we wouldn't want anyone to trip and sue the dome or anything. There's a lot more to see, so everybody better hurry 'cause you're gonna walk nine miles today. And when we get down there, there's also a weather station. It cost a third of a million dollars. Ok, everybody, stop here. We've got to wait for those laggers. Last time, we had ten people get lost... Ok, Johnson, let's go. Telephone, sir. It might be Captain Crandall wanting to know where we are. His facial expression never changes. His eyes are extraordinary. They're the most piercing blue I've ever seen. Now, there's a killer loose in the city, Johnson. Are we gonna get him or are we gonna go downtown and play politics? - Hi. - Hi. May I help you? I'm interested in a camera that would allow me to do some extremely detailed work. Sure. Sure. - Show him the Nikon, Gary. - This one? - Yes. - Yeah. Gary, remove the lens cap. Oh. Would there be a way of hanging it around my neck? Grab us a neck strap, Gary. There you go. Yeah. Now, what does something like that run? Price for this is, uh... You'll have to look it up in the book, Gary. - Excuse me... - Gary. My throat is killing me. Do you have any aspirin? - Aspirin? - I'll get some throat lozenges. - You look up the price. - Ok. Thank you. You have such a lovely smile. Oh. Well, thank you. You have a nice smile yourself. You must be a very happy person. Well, I try to make the best of things. Excuse me for a minute. Is there a manager around here that I could talk to? Right back there. Uh, is there anything I can help you with? Well, yes. Actually, I was thinking of taking this trip, and I was thinking of taking some snapshots. Right, that's a good idea. What kind of camera do you have? Actually, that's it. You see, I don't have a camera. You don't have a camera? Pardon me. - What? - Would you be interested in... - If you've got a minute. - Just a minute, will you? Is there a difference? Yeah. I'll show you. I'd like to talk to you for a minute if I could. Yeah, well, what about? Well, I've got a... Just a minute, lady. Who, me? Let me see your receipt. Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't buy anything. Well, would you mind showing me what's in your bag? Oh, surely. Uh, shampoo. - Mm-hmm. - Shampoo. Shampoo. I always buy three bottles at a time. Not that it's any cheaper, but it saves me a trip. My hair's so oily, I have to wash it every other day. Well, you've got beautiful hair. Yeah, what else is in the bag? Oh, my brush, Kleenex, crossword puzzle book. And Band-Aids, cologne. Mouthwash. - More shampoo. - Yeah. Not one of them lasted more than one day. Every Saturday, poor old Mr. Wright used to make his rounds, Every Saturday, there was a new driver. I interviewed them. I ought to know. Can you describe him? Down to the mole on the back of his neck. He had a mole on his neck? No! That's just a figure of speech. You know, like saying something is faster than greased lightning? Yeah, I know. I know. How tall was he? Oh, short. Very short. Like you. I'm six-one, Millhouse. You are? I'm five-nine, and you look shorter than me. You're standing on the steps. Oh. So I am. All right, where were you when you interviewed him? Here, right here where we are. You were up there and he was down here? - Is that right? - I think so. I'd so those steps are about eight inches. So, that means that if he was six-foot-one, he would have looked to you to be 16 inches shorter. About four-nine. Right. Under five feet. Short. Only I think I was down here. And... and he was there. Well, what the hell would he be doing up here? Well, he was short, like I said. And it made him feel better. All right, he was up here and you were down there. - Is that right? - Right. And he looked to you to be about four-foot-nine? That's right. Short. Jesus Christ, Millhouse, if he was four-foot-nine, and he was standing on 16 inches of steps, that'd make him only three-foot-five. That's right, he was short. Like you. There could be no more shocking statement than to say the closest living relatives to men are houseflies or that the butterfly evolved from a rhinoceros. But is there any real proof? Can evolution really prove birds came from reptiles? Birds are amazing creatures, fantastically designed, each for a different specific purpose. What's the matter, honey? Your leg hurt? God damn it! Does yours? Now, here. Hold this. Come on, Douglas. Stanford wants to see the monkeys. You shut up! I'll go when I'm damn good and ready. You hear? Don't you want to see the monkeys, Douglas? If I want to see some monkeys, I'll go over to nigger town. Where do you suppose that punk kid got a camera like that? Douglas, Stanford wants to see the monkeys. Come on... Listen here! You want that pansy son of yours to see some monkeys? He's your son too! You'll never convince me that pasty-face pansy came out of Douglas B. Breen. Now, take him to the car! And wait till I get there before I give you something you wish you hadn't got. The Brazilian Green Macaw... ...is as beautiful as it is rare. It soon becomes familiar with persons whom it sees frequently. But it has an aversion to strangers and sometimes attacks them with great fury. Hey, that's a nice looking camera you got there. Jap camera, ain't it? - Yeah, a Nikon. - Yeah, that's what I thought. Hey, you hear what the Jap girl said when she took off her brassiere? How'd you like to nip on these? You get it? “Nip on these," you know. Tits... nip. Hey, that must have set you back a pretty penny. No, this was a present from my grandfather. Ah, what's your grandfather? Some Jew millionaire? He's, uh... he's a ship's carpenter in the Merchant Marines. So every time he goes to Japan, he brings me back something like a lens or a tripod. Parental behavior when an intruder disturbs or endangers the nest or young, some birds slip away quietly and unobtrusively. Some may attack the intruder. - Take it easy. - Get over there! You know what that is? A poorly rolled cigarette. It's a marijuana cigarette. It's dope! It's dope I picked up after I saw you drop it out of your pocket. You give me that camera and we'll forget this little matter. If you don't, it's one to ten. So take your pick, kid. Mister, one of us is crazy. Oh, yeah? Breen. Narcotics. Being a murderer's bad enough, but a thief on top of it? What do you mean, a thief? He took one of Mr. Wright's books. - Lieutenant! - Wait a minute, Johnson. What do you mean he took one of Mr. Wright's books? He came here for a book. He said Mr. Wright sent him for it. And little did I know that the poor old man was dead. - Frank... - Which book did he take? This one right here, where this empty space is. - I hate to interrupt... - What is it? Well, there's been another one over at the zoo. - Strangling? - Yes, sir. Uh, Frank. Jesus Christ. What was the name of the book? I don't know the name of the book. It was given to Mr. Wright by his two brothers a long time ago. Man's first successful powered flight, on windswept sand dunes near Kitty Hawk, five men and a boy witnessed the first successful flight of an engine driven heavier than air flying machine. But it was hardly a bird. About what? About three-inch diameter? It doesn't look like he's got any holes anywhere here. Is he a friend of yours, Johnson, this Officer Breen? No, he's in narcotics. I'm in traffic. No, the only narcotics man I ever met was my wife's cousin Benny. He got busted for trafficking. It's kind of funny. Isn't it? I mean, he gets busted for trafficking and I'm in traffic. Hey, do you suppose that the strangler was a hophead? A what? You know, a dope addict. I don't know, Johnson. - Captain Crandall? - Yeah, Hanes. Hines. - Yeah. - I just found this over here. What the hell is it? I believe it's marijuana. You think so? I'll check that. Mrs. Green, would you and the kid get out of here for about a minute? Yeah. Matt, what about this? Is that marijuana? Well, there's no way, uh... What do you think? There's only one way to tell. - Send it to the lab. - Oh. Well, we're nearly there, Lieutenant. I mean Frank. All right, pull over here. - What? - Pull over right here. - Here? - Pull over. Park. Ok, Johnson, let's go. There's no point in them knowing we're friends. And how about his head? Where in the hell's he been, Johnson? This is Captain Crandall. Frank Shaft, San Francisco. How long's he been dead? Your plane got in three and a half hours ago. What I'd like to know is where in the hell have you been? Excuse me, Lieutenant. Permit me to introduce myself. I'm Haskell Weeks. Frank Shaft. Welcome to Houston, Lieutenant Shaft. And allow me to apologize for Captain Crandall, here. He's a good police officer, but I'm afraid he has not, as yet, mastered the simple art of common courtesy, have you, captain? What the hell are you doing? I told you fellas to keep over there behind the line! Bullshit. I'll convey your sentiments to the governor. The governor and I are very close. This the way he was found, Captain? Captain, aren't you going to answer the lieutenant? Look, I'm in charge of this case, Weeks. If you want this California hot shot to work on it, he'll work my way. You understand? Of course that's the way he was found. What do you think we are, stupid? - Was he on a case? - I don't know. I'm in traffic. Was he on a case? - Hanes? - Hines. - Was he in a case? - No, sir. Everybody's on the case whether off duty or on. Texas is a big state, Lieutenant. And there are still some of us here who don't realize... Can't you get that turtle out of here? - This his camera? - Yeah, the film's been taken out. He probably spotted the killer, followed him and was making some pictures, you know? Fingerprints? Yeah, I think we'll be able to get some good ones from that. Ok, well, let's make sure everything's covered before we release it to his family. What about them? Huh? Who's gonna tell his wife and kid? Ah, I don't know. What's this stuff on his eye? That's, uh... It's bird... It's... you know... Bird shit. Jesus Christ. Why didn't you cover him up? That happened before. It was there when we found him. They all had it on 'em. All of 'em? Every one. It's the time of year. - You know my car's completely ruined? - Shit. If you have any problem in our city, Lieutenant, feel free to call on me. And if you get a spare moment, we'll have a cocktail together. I'm an old friend of your mayor's. Are you through yet, Shaft? I want to know what kind of bird it was. God almighty. Let's go, Norwood. Wing muscles. Approximately 50 different wing muscles... ...and muscle slips have been described as affecting the wing... Brewster! It's me. Hope. Hi, Brewster. I've been living on graham crackers for a week. - I got your stuff. - And my peanut butter? Uh-huh. I almost got caught stealing the rose hips. Thank you. Brewster, what's the difference between rose hips and regular vitamin C? They're organic. What does "organic" mean? Hope, you're the one who works in the health food store, You're the one who's supposed to know that. Mrs. Parker never tells me anything. She just yells at me. Date nut bread? Yeah, do me a favor, put 'em on the table. I gotta finish my exercises. I got you coconut pecan cookies with raw sugar and unbleached flour and... We're all right. And, um... chocolate covered raisins for energy. Wow, Brewster. You're really in great shape. How many of those can you do? Hundreds. Oh, wow. I gotta do 'em. I brought my own lunch, too. Hot dog. Brewster? Tell me again what you're doing here. What do you think I'm doing? I know you're doing chin-ups, but I mean, what's the rest of it about? I'm building my wings. You're making an airplane? No. What are you doing? I'm flying away. Where are you flying to? Away. Wow. Brewster... Do you ever think about anything except flying? Sure. You think about girls? Brewster? Yeah, all the time. Oh, wow. What are you up to? - Huh? - 215. 215? Brewster! Are you thinking about me or are you thinking about flying? Oh! Oh, Brewster! What are you up to? Tell me! Please! What are you up to? Huh? What are you up to? 253! Wow. Wow! What?! Oh, what?! Wow, Brewster. You're really something. The... the Jackdaw is easily trained and made with little difficulty to be taught to pronounce several words. Now, listen, tonight... Listen. I'm gonna take you over there, right? - Marty, don't answer it. - You know I have to, Angie. Hello. Johnson, this is Frank Shaft. How do you do, Lieutenant Shaft? Uh, Frank. I didn't interrupt your dinner, did I? Hmm? Oh, uh... No, I... finished about an hour ago. Good. Listen, I want you to take these bird shit samples over to the lab. Right now, sir? Uh, Frank? I'd do it myself but I'm busy right now. I need somebody I can trust on this. Well, I'm, uh... I'm, uh... right out the door now. Johnson, you're a good cop. Near the sky box, also the presidential suite, is the white area over there to the right of the Texico sign. That's where President Johnson views the game from when he's here at the stadium. And if President Nixon ever attends, he'll watch the game from that box. But after baseball season... Hi, Louise. Hi, Brewster. That girl was here. Hope? Yep. I got a whole new thing of health food. I did 300 today. Nothing goes on between you two, does it? Me and Hope? She seems so passionate. I really didn't notice. You ever think about that sort of thing? What? Girls. You know. Sex? Hey, Louise, I think you've been talking to Hope. She just asked me the same exact thing. All right, Brewster. Time to relax. Come on, we have to stay on schedule. Why do you always ask me about Hope? Because she's passionate and she can involve you. Involve me? In what? Sex. Is Hope really like that? People like Hope accept what's been told to them. They don't think they can be free. They don't even believe they can be free. Their sex is the closest thing they have to... Flying. Yes. Flying. Don't they want to fly? Only at first. Something happens to them as they grow. And they... They turn more and more toward earth. When they experience sex, they simply settle for it. And procreate more of their own kind. So you must never be tempted, let anything take your full concentration away from your work. I don't think I could do it without your help. I'll always be here to help you, Brewster.

Let me count the ways I love thee to the breadth and depth and height my soul can reach..." I can't put into words how I personally feel about this brave officer who died so nobly. Bullshit. Speaking for myself and my entire staff. Save it, Weeks. Green was a bad cop, and that camera was hot for Christ's sake. He was a thief as well as a shake-down artist.

Are you trying to steal my car? What? I asked you if you were trying to steal my car. Is this your car? It looks exactly like my car. Uh, you even have the little statue in front like mine. That's the Virgin Mary. They used to be real popular a long time ago. This is a very weird... there aren't too many orange and black cars around, you know. Uh, I apologize. I didn't...

I'll take you where you're gonna go. Uh, I would like to pick up a few photos that I'm having printed. Pictures? I love pictures. Are they in color? Yeah. Well, let's go. You're the chauffeur. McCloud, are you happy here working? Courtship is ordinarily the province of the male, and he shows his wares before the female with an astonishing assortment of tricks of varying according to the species. He may posture so as to reveal his gaudiest nuptial plumage. Spread his tail and erect his crest or inflate brilliantly colored pouches and parade, dance, fly with dizzying acrobatics. Sing his most fetching love song. You were on the tour, weren't you? Tour? Yeah, I liked it. You kept ducking out all the time. Did I bore you? I had to go to the bathroom. Oh, diarrhea. That's tough. Hope it wasn't from eating Mexican food. That's bad. But that's when I usually get it. Have you ever had diarrhea from eating Mexican food before? I like your car. It's not mine, really. I met this guy at the racetrack. Automobile races. You know, stock cars, midgets. Anyway, I'm a race car driver. I don't have a car or anything, but sometimes some of the guys let me drive for them. Anyway, one night this guy offered to take me home. So I said ok. Well, instead of taking me home, he took me to Memorial Park. I mean, wow, he tried to rape me. Anyway, I hit him with a lug wrench and drove home. I haven't seen him since so I've got this neat little Roadrunner. How long ago was that? A couple of weeks. Does he know where you live? No, maybe that's why he never came to pick it up. And it's really sort of a neat little car. It's all souped up and everything. See? "I love thee freely, as men strive for right I love thee purely, as men turns from praise I love thee with passion put to use In my old griefs, and with my...“ - Hey! - What? Come on, for God's sake. "I love thee with a love I seemed to lose with my lost saints I love thee with..." “I choose to love thee better every day" Oh, God. That's fantastic. That'll be $468.50, sir. Uh, yeah, you charge that for me, will ya? Oh, those are the biggest snapshots I ever seen. Yeah. They sure are pretty, though. What are they? These are studies of the yutaxican diasteraxic arrangements of the major covetan secondaries of the phoenicopteridae. Oh, I thought maybe they were pictures of your mother and father at the beach. No, these are photos that I took at the zoo of various birds. I was just joking, Brewster. Huh? I tell you what, I got this great dinner planned tonight at my house, so how'd you like to come over? Oh, fine. Fine. - Uh-huh. - What is it? Uric acids, amino acids. Formers of glucose, traces of saturated almond. Whoops! It's bird shit, for Christ's sake. We all know that. Is this how you got your rep, Sheriff, running around collecting shit samples? What kind of a bird did it come from? Well, we couldn't tell you that. Tell you what it ate, but I don't think we can determine what kind of bird it came from. Besides, it might not have been a bird. I know bird shit when I see it. Now, I suggest we drop this bird shit shit and settle down to some old-fashioned police work. You go ahead and do your old-fashioned police work, Captain, and leave me alone to work in my own way. This is my department, Sheriff. I was under the impression that I could handle this case my way, is that true or what? We don't have to draw such fine lines, gentlemen, we're all after the same thing. Not necessarily. I doubt it even come from a bird. I'll just assume I did not hear that. What else could've done it? A snake, toad maybe. Maybe even one of those turtles. Christ, I've heard of everything. Turtle shit. We could've told more if you hadn't of broken the geometric composition, you know? Besides this is only a small portion. It's not a full sample. Lieutenant, perhaps you'd like to reconsider my invitation for dinner. I tell ya, maybe a scatologist could help. What's a scatologist? There will be some people there who can be very useful to one's career. You know, shit. Can you get us one? There's a guy over at the University of Houston who's supposed to be pretty good. Should we say nine o' clock, then? I really don't have time for this small talk, Mr. Weeks. I hope you're not being hostile, Lieutenant. May I remind you that it was I who brought you in on this case. There's a message here for you. Read it. Read it. Go on. Well, there's something confidential about it. There's nothing confidential in the police department. Read it, Hanes. "Hines." Your mother says that when you pick up the olive oil, you should also get some romaine. Pollution. Of greater importance than ever before is the bird's adaptation to the new conditions. Since man, his traps, his guns and his pollution... ...have come upon the scene, upsetting all the order of nature and slowly, surely, claiming the whole earth for himself and his own destruction. Hi, nice to see you. There's still no guarantee that that film came from Green's camera. But all the pictures were taken at the zoo. What the hell does that mean? Everybody takes pictures at the goddamn zoo. They think they got a picture. They got in these cameras. Never mind this, where's Hanes? - “Hines." - Where is Shaft? He's in the back in the lab. - Wendell? - What is it? How you doing? I'm putting it in the soup now. We got a lot of important fuzz out here. You call us when we can see that thing. - Well? - It's in the soup now. I started racing 'cause of this guy I was in love with. His name was Bernard and he was a really neat artist. He used to do etchings on cider bottles. Boy, was he a genius. He was beautiful, too. He had hair out to here. But his daddy was rich and made him cut his hair and then go into politics. Evidently he didn't get too far though 'cause he's only a secretary. Anyway, the whole deal made me so mad, I broke every one of his cider bottles. Especially the one he dedicated to me. When is the goddamn picture going to be ready? Wendel's working on the negatives right now. Color lab? I'll see. Is there a Lieutenant Shaft here? This your bourbon? Haskell Weeks here, Lieutenant. I understand you might have a lead. The lab had an electronic surveillance camera. We'll have the film in a few minutes. Why don't you come sit over here with me? No, I gotta be going now, I think. Brewster, here I am sitting over here on the couch, and inviting you to do, well, who knows what? And you just sit there and say, "Oh, no, I've gotta go home." Yeah, I do gotta go home, though. I think I'll have a little of that. Don't you get it? You're in traffic and... Oh, I'm sorry. I thought this was the ladies' room. - What? - What the hell is that? Do you think you can get a decent description of the man who brought it in? Well, Lieutenant, why don't you drop over here for an after-dinner drink? There's someone here who'd very much like to meet you. It's not my fault this time. The red light was on, and the door's supposed to be closed when the red light is on. That's the rule. Thanks! Christ. Well, is he coming? I'm afraid not, Senator. He's a very dedicated man. What about them ballplayers? Curfew, Senator. They have a very strict... curfew. Astronauts? Does he know any astronauts? Weeks! Aren't you going to kiss me? I don't know how. Brewster, are you a virgin? Am I a virgin? I bet you live with your mother, don't you? No, I live by myself. - Where? - By the Dome, in a room. I gotta get going. It'll take me a while to get back. Oh, look, take my car. I can get a ride with Nicki. She works at the Dome, too. You can meet me there at 4:00, and I'll get my car then. How's that for a good plan? Ok. That way I'll get to see you tomorrow. Goodbye. Don't forget 4:00. Hey, boy! Where the hell you think you're going with that car? Pardon me? "Pardon me," my ass. That car belongs to Billy Joe Goodwill, and that happens to be me. And I've been chasing you down for a long time. I think you've made an error. There's been a goddamn error made, all right. But you and that dingy girlfriend of yours are the one that made the error. And now I'm fixed to strum your head, and when I get through with you, I'm gonna go up to... What do you have on this guy, Harry? Well, his name was Billy Joe Goodwill. Goodwill? There seems to be some connection with racecar drivers. Can you tell me when the guy died? Can you find that out? The Widow Green got the full pension. To hell with the Widow Green, we got another murder on our hands. Say, are you with the lab? He's got a very good reputation. What kind of reputation? The Santa Barbara Strangler surrendered to him. The Santa Barbara Strangler... surrendered himself. He surrendered himself, see? He must have trusted him. It's a goddamn waste of time, you ask me. It could yield a clue. I know it seems far-fetched. What sort of clue are we going to get from bird shit? - Well, you can't... - What happened? Is anybody hurt? No, everything's all right, young lady. We're just having a drill for the ambulance drivers. They need a little training, you know? You run along. We take care of things. - Oh, - Jesus Christ. Hey, Brewster. Right on time! Wow! Where you going? I wanna be by myself. I need some time to think. Why don't you come with me? Nah, I think I'll take a walk. Yeah, I'd really like to go with you. Ok. Dammit. Come on, right now. This sample here is the excrement that we took off Officer Green's body while the second one here is the sample we took off the last victim, Mr. Goodwill. I think that we can definitely say that these two samples came from the same bird. You sure it was a bird? It wasn't no flying turtle, was it? Sarcasm so early in the day, Captain? Yes, we can definitely say it was a bird. What kind of bird? Well, we can't really say about that, but we can be sure that it was from a small bird. Perhaps a pigeon or a small pheasant or perhaps a... perhaps a raven. Well, the guy's a bird freak. It's probably a pet. Yeah? Yeah? Well, you just look for some kook with a bird on his shoulder. We'll be running down a 1970 orange Roadrunner... It's mango. ..."orange" Roadrunner, license plate number... D-U-V-2-2-2. I want a pickup on that car, and it's dangerous. Who might that be, Captain? Goodwill's car, it's missing. Yeah. The killer probably has it, but he won't keep it for long so let's get going, Hanes. - "Hines." - Watch it there. Perhaps Captain Crandall is right. Perhaps you should not have been brought in on the case at all, Lieu... Lieutenant. I'd like to go on record right now. I do not... admire a man who uses others as a stepping stone to gain his own ends. What is this? Come on, Brewster, you're going to love it. Calling all cars, calling all cars. Be on the lookout for a 1970 mango-orange Roadrunner, license number D-U-V-2-2-2. Approach with caution, y'all, occupant is considered dangerous. That is all. All right, Johnson, here it is: Take Memorial to West Loop South, take West Loop South to South Beach. I'll ride 59 to Post Oak Road and I'll meet you on West Loop South. Now, if you see him, don't get heroic. Just hang back and call me. We don't know what he'll do if he sees a squad car. - Got it? - Yes, sir. - Frank. - I mean Frank. Ok, let's go, Johnson. Welcome aboard, crew, my name's Gina, and I'm gonna be your guide right now. Are there any people on board from out of state, out of town or foreigners? Yes, sir, where are you from? - Mississippi. - Mississippi. - Well, how's Mr. Sippi? - Fine. Fine, well, good. Among forms of behavior which show great stereotypes are those that have to do with care of the body surface. To bathe in water, most species immerse the head, suddenly raise it and then begin beating the wing. Look up there to your right, there's our famous god, Boomba. Every time I think of all the years you've spent with that monster, I just start shaking. You didn't deserve that. I mean, he was a monster. That was all he was. You deserve the best. Not to say that I'm the best. Now, we're entering to the land of the Shirley Indian tribe. See that temple they built? Well, you'll never guess what we call it, the Shirley Temple. And you know, we're thinking of painting that Shirley Temple black. Say, Rob, you haven't seen a Roadrunner around here with a racing-type setup, have you? Uh, no. Is something wrong? Oh, great, another parking ticket. I don't even know why. They're a waste of paper. Think we got a line on the Strangler. Yeah, license number D-U-V-2-2-2. Why, I just gave them... Ho! Frank. 2-3-12... 2-3-12 to mobile unit 710. 2-3-12 to mobile unit 710. Over. Yeah, what is it, Johnson? I've got him, sir... Frank. D-U-V-2-2-2, right in front of me. Jesus Christ, Johnson, I told you to call me. You were just supposed to spot him and call me. Well, that's all I've done, sir. I spotted them, they haven't spotted me. Look, they're right in front of me. They don't even know I'm behind them. I'm incognito. I don't have my light on or anything. Where? I'm on the south loop going west, so if you take the Old Spanish Trail going east, you can head them off. Ok, keep in sight of a save act. When you see me, call. 2-3-12 clear. Clear. 2-3-12 to mobile unit 710. Yep? I'm at a stoplight one block south from Old Spanish Trail, over. Ok, Jonathan, I see you. Jesus Christ. I've got them, Frank. You all right, Mother, it's not too hot for you? You wanna look this way? You wanna look right at me? - That's great. - That's where I'm looking. Ok, wanna hold it. Can I ask you to switch places here? Could you... That's great. Should I be standing next to Hines? Yeah. Ok. Hold it, don't move. Ah! Police business, ma'am. Would you follow that car? Follow that car? I'd love to. Are you all right? My legs are crushed. I'm trapped in here. I'll get some help. That won't be necessary. Brewster! Brewster! Brewster! Brewster! Ham and buckwheat honey! Whoo! Brewster, I'm watching the ball game. Oh, oh, Brewster! Come over to the... Brewster. Oh, let's count. One, two, three, four! Oh, Brewster, I can't hear you. Come on! Brewster, they were bind! One, two... Come on! Brewster? It's hot in here. Aren't you going to take off your coat? Boy, am I sweating. That was some race, huh? Those cops really hung in there. Brewster, I can't hear you! 212! I can't hear you! Come on, Brewster, we were dying! I meant to get you buckwheat honey, but I made a mistake and got you coconut banana. That was your first time, wasn't it? Mm-hmm. That means that I'm responsible for you from now on. When will I get to see you again? Always, forever. I guess you'll just have to fly away with me. I'm scared of aeroplanes. Last time I flew to Dallas, I got so scared, I soiled right through my new dress. I can kinda fly. Real flying. I have wings... like a bird. Wings? You're kidding. Mm. Uh-uh. I've been working on them for a long time. They're almost finished. You mean you've got real wings that work? And that you can really fly with? Mm-hmm. - You're kidding. - No. Where are they? Where I live in the Dome. You live in the Astrodome? You're kidding. Where? In the fallout shelter. And you've got wings that really work? Mm-hmm. You're kidding. You keep saying that. Do you think I'd just make that up? When can you try them out? Tomorrow. I can fly tomorrow? I waited up for you. It's very late. You should be in bed. I'm not tired. That girl almost got you caught. I asked you not to see her again. I think I'm capable of picking my own friends. You only have one friend, Brewster, me. I'm the only one who cares about you. Why did you lie to me? I never lied to you. I'm the only one who has never lied to you. It's happened, hasn't it? It's not like you would say it would be at all, Louise. Suzanne is nothing like you said. Brewster do you realize what that means if they work? Yeah. We can fly away together. "Fly away." Brewster, you could be a millionaire. I've got to get you a good lawyer to protect you. And you'll need a patent. Bernard'll know. Remember he's my old boyfriend. The one I told you about who works for the politician. You could get a limousine with a chauffeur and everything. Suzanne, you're talking crazy. You can get a house on River Oaks Boulevard. Brewster, how could you? Louise, if Suzanne upsets you that much, maybe you better go. You told her everything about yourself, didn't you? But we have to fly away. Why? Why can't we stay here? This is my home. I love it here. They'll put me in a cage. Why? You know all the people who died? You mean the ones who were strangled? Mm-hmm. I'm responsible. She's coming here, isn't she? Don't you know what she'll do? She'll be the death of you. We could leave now. We could leave now. All right, we'll go now. But it'll take me a little time to get ready. So why don't you go ahead and go to the Dome and begin getting the wings ready. And I'll meet you there in the fallout shelter. Right? - Suzanne? - Huh? I love you, and Louise was wrong. ♪ I... ♪ ♪ Promise not to tell ♪ ♪ I... ♪ ♪ Promise not to tell ♪ ♪ I... ♪ ♪ Promise not to tell ♪ ♪ I... ♪ ♪ Promise not to tell ♪ Hello? May I speak to Bernard? Who? Bernard. He's supposed to work there. I think he's a secretary or something. Just a moment. It's for you. Bernard, you know I do not approve of your taking personal phone calls during business hours. Well, who is it? I hope it's an emergency. Hello? Bernard, it's me, Suzanne. Suzanne, Mr. Weeks doesn't like me getting personal calls at work. But it's an emergency. It's an emergency. I've been dating this really weird boy. His name is Brewster... Brewster McCloud. Bernard, I think he's crazy. He thinks he can fly, and I think he's the one who's been strangling all those people. You mean you know who the strangler is? Give me that phone. Young lady? This is Haskell Weeks. What? Can't close this goddamned door. And you say he says he can fly, Miss Ferris? Yeah, that's what he said. He said he's got wings he made himself. He probably swoops down on people and strangles them. Mm-hmm. It looks like he's deranged also. Suzanne is very gullible, Mr. Weeks. And yet he did confess to the stranglings, however. Yes! You don't know how it scared me being here with a crazy person. Shall I call the police, Mr. Weeks? No. No, we shall... shall not call the police. I am going to bring in this confessed killer myself. When I have him safely in my custody, and I've had a chance to consider all the political options of that move, then we'll notify the police. Are you about ready, Miss, uh... All ready. Hi, Bernard. The blue footed booby will compete for the attentions of her intended by goose stepping in front of him, raising her bright blue feet as high as she can and thrusting out her chest. - Wait in the car, Bernard. - But don't you want me to go with you? There are times, Bernard, when a man works best alone. This is one of those times. What did he mean by that? I don't know, but it's something worth remembering. - Bernard, I've missed you so. - Me, too. Shit. Stupid. Bernard! I get so tired of “Norwood! Norwood!“ - We better not. - Yeah, what's wrong? It's not right. Yes, it is. I mean, we're not married. It's all right. All right, I'll marry you. When? Today, just as soon as Mr. Weeks gets back. Courtship activities have the further function of regulating the timing of sex readiness, so that the reproductive physiology of a pair may be synchronized. This is particularly important in a flying animal which cannot afford to carry indefinitely the extra ballast of greatly enlarged gonads. Take me. Uh, maybe we'd better wait until we're married this evening. You're not going to leave me like this. Well, we better go look for Mr. Weeks. He's been gone a long time. Let's not be sleeping on the job, Norwood. It's Mr. Weeks! Is he dead? I don't know. Then maybe we better find out. Ok. He's dead, all right. Well, what do you think we ought to do? Call the police. Good idea. What are you doing? I'm getting the number of the police. Oh, Bernard. Bernard, everything's so awful.
