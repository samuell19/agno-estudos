I got to go. Sorry. Are you okay? Thank you. Lights. Manadoro, where are you going? Are my critiques so terrifying? I'm sorry. It's an emergency. Joey. Go round to 14th. Keep your eyes open. Nicky? Nicky? Get over here. Don't go anywhere. Where are you going? Stay over here. Stay here. What the fuck's he gonna do to him, Lou? Lou, you can stop this thing. Jesus Christ! Nick. Nicky. Nicky Shades was the best sewer-to-sewer football player ... I ever saw. Everyone thought he was gonna be a big star in college ... and then go pro. Yeah! But after 9/11, he enlisted and went to Afghanistan. I didn't have the balls to do anything like that. The furthest I'd ever been from the neighborhood ... was the Jersey shore, when my mother got sick. But I'd always wanted to do something brave ... like Nicky. In a way, that's how this all got started. I don't understand. Why are you not registered yet? You see, they only gave me a partial scholarship, just a partial one, and they need me to take a full group of courses, which I can't afford the full group. Well, based on your father's income, you should qualify for loans. A loan? When my father got out of the service, he had a wife and two kids. Couldn't find a job. Didn't want to go on welfare ... because he didn't believe in charity. He shined shoes. Six days a week, ten hours a day. He told me, if any of the kids asked, that he worked on Wall Street. Which technically he did. Well, that's very admirable. But things have changed. Our government owes trillions of dollars. Surely you can borrow $30,000 or $40,000. Mike, let me tell you something. The only school worth that ... would teach you how to print money. Your father's a funny man. He's joking about counterfeiting. Look, if you could just do me a favor ... and get me into a photography workshop ... with Professor Reyerson, if you could just get me into that one class, one class, this guy can teach me everything I need to know, everything. It's like having an appetizer at a really nice restaurant ... or eating a full meal at a crappy drive-through place. You get what I'm saying? Besides, I always tip really nice, really, really nice. Let me give you a tip. This is a university, not a Brooklyn trattoria. So you're just gonna have to coax your father ... into the 21st century. Sorry. You're fuckin' sorry? Sorry, are you kidding me? - Hey. You don't know my father; you don't know me, you prick.

Who would have thought the ass end of Brooklyn ... would be the next hot neighborhood? But some days, it was hard to tell. My friends sure as shit hadn't gotten the news. Hi, Joe. Oh, thanks. All right, I'll talk to you later. So what happened? A three-hour trip now? There's traffic. What do you want me to do? Again with this fucking camera. Put the fucking camera down. This is a job here. We're working, okay? Gina Abruzzi, my girlfriend. She said she'll quit smoking the day I ask her to marry me. So on top of everything else, I cause lung cancer. You should try actually sleeping in the bed. Come on, we're late. All right, I will be out in five minutes. If it ain't Beau Brumbles himself. What's the con?

Since his accident, my father couldn't drive, do any heavy lifting. He was on the disability pension, which he supplemented quite nicely ... by taking action in the neighborhood bars. I drove him on his rounds every morning, and then he dropped off his receipts with Tony. When I was young, I thought Tony was king of the world. My father had to explain his territory ended at 4th Avenue. Hey. Rumor had it the Albanian mob was even encroaching on that. Somebody had torched one of Tony's social clubs, and so he was hanging around his brother Lou's car service. Can I talk to you about something? I told you, no loans. Come on, give the fuckin' kid a tip. Don't be a cheap bastard. He drives you around every fuckin' day. He won't take nothin'. Nothin'. No? You good people like your old man? Come on, let's get a drink. I got so much stuff to — - Small drink, that big. - All right. - Come on. - Go. Every fuckin' time. I worked in a typical car service crew, evenly split between the retired ... Danny, go, shoot. And the retarded. Any one, just put one down, go. Cocksucker. - You said to throw. - That's what you throw? This is what I get for playing ... with a goddamn born-again Christian. Wait, wait, so if he don't gamble, you pay double? Yeah, and if we win, I win double. But so far, that's just a beautiful fuckin' theory. You're not allowed to drink neither. It's a choice. He's allowed to screw his wife, so long as he don't enjoy it. Car service. Come on. It's Eileen Zaccaro. Who's up? - I'm up. No, you're not up. I'm up. For Eileen Zaccaro, I'm way up. Eileen Zaccaro. Damn. She sucked and fucked everything that moved, and everybody knew that except for her husband, Phil Zaccaro. It's gonna be Danny. About five minutes, Eileen, all right? Hey, Danny, have her come in here. She could do all of us. Yeah, invite Philly Zac. He can come watch. You both make me sick. Oh, yeah, born again. Once was bad enough with this fuckin' guy. You know, God danced the day that you were born. But when you have a heart attack in the Battery Tunnel, he's not gonna care that you meant to straighten out.

Just give this guy a break. If he breaks down, I look bad. And guess what. This is my business. I understand that, Lou. Look, if he breaks down, I'll give him my car. He fought for our country. Hey, I fuckin' know that. I don't hire war heroes. I need reliable drivers. Joey. The fuck are you doing? Get going. All right, look, if you vouch for him. I do.

Yeah, that — that's actually why I came. I, um ... I'm not gonna be able to come here this year. Really? And why is that? I'm sorry, I — I — I can't tell you how much I wanted to study with you. - No, tell me, how much? - Excuse me? How much does photography mean to you? It's a family thing and a financial thing. I just wanted to tell you in person. And you need what? They just said that your class was full, and — and I can't get in unless you sign a waiver. Apparently, there's an opening now. It's too bad.

Tony and Lou went to see a couple of the Albanians ... down at the gas station on the parkway ... to set 'em straight, right? These guys start yelling. Tony pulls his gun out, tells 'em to calm the fuck down. Next thing you know, the Albanians got their guns out, but they're pointing them at the gas pumps. Those fuckin' maniacs, they were gonna blow up the whole fuckin' block. Jesus. Jimmy, go pick up Mrs. C. Yeah, boss. So who the fuck is that guy? It's Edward; he's from the Russians, 'cause the Russians are the only ones ... that won't take shit from the fuckin' Albanians. Hey, Mike.

You pick up a package from this Ethiopian nigger, and you bring it to a hebe in Borough Park. What's in the package? That, my friend, don't concern you. Is it drugs? Look, it pays two grand a week, which is enough for you not to ask questions. Just for delivering a package. I need someone trustworthy. All right. But ... I'm gonna need six weeks up front. What?

Anyway, he — he doesn't work there anymore. He — he was in an accident. He's on working compensation. Is he okay? Yeah, he's fine. He's just got a bit of a limp, and to be honest, it's actually probably better for him, 'cause he — he likes to dress up all nice. He never used to wear his work clothes in front of us. He'd always bring a bag to work with him ... and change before he got home. Kind of like he had to separate his job ... from his identity. What?

Yeah, I should go too. Well. Oh. Wake up, Mike. I'm not the neighborhood hero. Listen, our over-arching theme should be ... deviance in the age of globalization. One country's legal punishment ... is another's human rights violation. That's moral relativism. It is all relative. Not if you're a victim of female circumcision. Oh, okay, see that's nasty. It's not a crime in their culture. - What? - Check it. Most 187s, they had head trauma. They'd get beat the shit out of by their dads. Yeah, violence is directly related to testosterone. No, it's poverty. Crime goes up — And as I was saying before I was interrupted, most crimes are committed by young males, regardless of wealth, race, or nationality. Mike, what do you think? I think she's lazy as shit. This school costs $12,800 a semester. Divide that by four courses, 14 weeks, one class per week. It's basically $233 we're pissing away here, talking amongst ourselves.

Well, you should keep on working. These aren't due till Monday. No, it's all right. I want to hand 'em in now. You shouldn't. They're no good. Can we talk outside for a second? I'm sorry, but the last presentation, lowly interiors, was ten shots inside of a janitor's closet. The one before that was armpits and feet. What do you want me to do? Worry about your own work. Ah, Toni, yeah, I'll see those later. Look, if you don't like my stuff, why'd you give me the scholarship? Because I thought I could teach you. The scholarships aren't a pat on the back, if that's what you think they are. I didn't say that. The work in your portfolio was much more interesting than this. The Verrazano Bridge at night, a sidewalk cafe, I can get these on postcards at the chamber of commerce. When did you stop taking portraits? Your work was so personal. Now it's just like you're trying to be as generic as possible, trying to blend in. I do have other stuff. It's just not for everyone, okay? Yeah, like that pretty girl you sit next to. Well, she's not grading you; I am. I need to see something realer, something with a point of view, eh? And, Mike, you've got to work harder. Your mates are in the darkroom until midnight. You barely make it to class on time. And don't ever ask me to step outside again, like we're in a bar. Hey, you want to skip the library ... and maybe get a drink? We have to work. What about Rocco's? You like that place, right? Oh, sure. So it's me, then. Look, we're just really different, okay? And I'm not saying that that's a bad thing. It's just with two classes and a project, it's risky. It could get awkward. Awkward. Look where you're going, asshole. What the fuck did you say to me? What the fuck did you say to me, huh? I'm sorry, take it easy. I'm sorry, I made a mistake. I'm sorry. Wait. It's okay. Hi. Hi. - Oh! - Jesus. Sorry. You leaving? No, I just moved my car. I used your keys. Do you want me to leave? No. No, don't be stupid. You must think I'm crazy. What? No, hey, no. I tell you it's too risky, and then here we are, and I'm leaving for the summer, and you probably have a girlfriend anyway. Is that — is that her on your chest? That's my mother. I'm sorry. It's okay. Hey, hey. It's okay. You didn't know. What kind of guy leaves a girl like you ... in the middle of the night?

Oh, awkward. What is that, your new word from college? Jesus Christ, Gina, let's just go fuckin' talk someplace, all right? We need to talk. - Oh, so now you want to talk. Yeah. I left you four messages. Jesus Christ, Gina, let's just fuckin' go and talk, all right? Just not right here. - No. - Fuck. You know what? You come see me when you're ready to talk commitment. Commitment. Until then, just don't talk to me at all. Come on, baby, what, I'll marry you. Yeah, I bet you would. Yeah, I will. Come on, we'll have beautiful children. Fuck off! You can — you can have those. I printed 'em out for you. You're late. Oh, Mike. I need to lock up. - Hey. - What? - Look at me. - What? Turn it off. I've almost finished my presentation. Can I see it? - No. - Why? Nah. Why? I don't want to show it to you. You got to see it with everybody else. With everybody else? I'm not like everybody else. I'm sleeping with you. No, that's not gonna work. - Come on, show me. - No. Show me. Show me. You left your flash drive on the nightstand. I'm gonna show myself. Oh, no, no. No. Come here. Come here, you. Hey. What? What are you gonna do to me, huh? I'm not scared of you. Give it to me. I'm not scared of you. I'm not anymore. Poor old Danny. Yeah, that dopey fuck. He's got his jaw in a vice. Six weeks before he can eat. It's like I said, that little triangle's more powerful ... than a freakin' load of tanks. True. - Am I right? - Yeah. Armies have gone to war. Kings have lost their thrones. Listen to your father, Mike. He speaks from experience. You know, your mother, God rest her soul, she was the prettiest girl in Bay Ridge. I mean, we were both nuts about her. But we make choices in life, right, Vin? $50. I fold. $100. Oh. I'm out. Yeah, that's a fuckin' surprise. Take it down. Lou, go get that good bottle of scotch I got you. Mike, get it from the back, will you? It's by the bar. Yeah, sure. All right. Kid's a fuckin' card shark. I don't know. Edward, do me a favor? Go get us a couple of meatball subs. It's gonna be a late night. I'm fuckin' starving. Counting your money? You're gonna lose it all. It's all gonna be gone by the end of the night. What do you care? Oh, Nicky, you're not on tonight. Why don't you go work on that wreck of yours? I got other things to worry about tonight, Lou. Now, how do you like it with a fuckin' gun in your face? Isn't this what you do to people? Nick, calm down. It's crazy. You're fuckin' killing my neighborhood. I'm gonna fuckin' kill you. I'm gonna fuck — I'm gonna fuckin' kill you. Mike? What are you doing here? Nick? Nick, what are you doing? Someone want to tell me what the fuck this is all about? I almost fuckin' died, and you're killing my fuckin' neighborhood, and I'm gonna fuckin' kill you. No, no, no, no! Get a beer or something, come on! Sit, sit! What the fuck? What are you gonna do? You come into my joint? You point a gun at me? You out of your fuckin' mind? Give me your watch. What? Give me your fuckin' watch. Jesus. You got be kidding me, Nicky. Jesus. You better take all that money, 'cause you just bought yourself a world of hurt, son. Shut the fuck up! Nick. Put it back. Give it back. Nick. Nicky. Come on. So now you're in it. Tough guys, huh? Do it. Do it. Please, Mike. Come on. Don't make me do this. I want it to be you, Mike. Do it. Make your fuckin' balls, Mike. That's your fuckin' employee of the month? Is he here yet? Can I come in? Do you want something to drink? No, thanks. Hey, he'll be back. They're great. I got to go. Sorry. Are you okay? What's the matter? I'll see you tonight. Thank you. Lights. Manadoro, where are you going? Are my critiques so terrifying? Sorry, I got to go. Mike, this is it, your grades for the whole class. I'm sorry. It's an emergency. Professor, I'm supposed to see Mike tonight ... if you want me to give that to him. Joey. Go round to 14th. Keep your eyes open. Nicky? Nicky? Hey, whoa, where the fuck are you going? You stay right here. Hey, Nicky! Just shut the fuck up and stay right where you are. Don't fuckin' move. What's he gonna do to him, Lou? Lou, you can stop this thing. I told you from the beginning, I didn't want no war hero. You know, he was in Afghanistan too, back when it was the Russians. Nick! Nicky. What the fuck did you do? You motherfucker! What the fuck did you do? Oh, shit. Mike? Nicky. Mike. Ow. Nicky. I swear to God, I'll fucking kill you! Mike, help me go. Act of God, act of man. What's the fuckin' difference? Your mother is as dead as Nicky Shades, you know. I wish I had someone like Tony to blame. I should've brought the wig to the hospital that day. The look on her face. She was so fuckin' disappointed, you know? Well, it had such beautiful red hair. It was hard for her to lose it. But you were 16. 16, you're on a subway, holding a red wig on a Styrofoam head, it's embarrassing, I know. I get that. I get that. Vinny, I — I got the car ready when you — Yeah, yeah. H — Hey, what — what's up, Mike? You're a stone — cold prick to these guys now. Remember that you've got that going for you. Sal, Jimmy, go get us some coffees. Listen, sometimes my brother can be fuckin' careless. I didn't intend for him to involve you in this. I know that you and Shades were tight. But you knew it had to happen. It's nice to see a kid from the neighborhood ... who understands and respects the old codes and values. Now, today was supposed to be your last Oyster Bay run, but by way of thanks, I'm giving you the job permanent. Holy shit! It's not worth it. Let it go, bro. Let it go. Oh, Mikey. Thank God. Can you help me, darling, with this garbage? It's so heavy. - Sorry, I can't, Miss Gattei. 40 years I'm your neighbor, you can't help me with a little garbage? There. God bless you. Pop. I'm so glad you're here. You okay, son? They jacked — they jacked my car. What happened to the bag? I think they took it. They took it. Oh, Jesus. Hey, it's Mike. Leave me a message. Hey, it's me again. I just haven't heard back from you, and I'm getting kind of freaked out, so give me a call. Listen to me. We got to talk ... before we go downstairs. Can I help you? Yeah, I'm looking for Mike. He's not here right now, but he'll be back in a while. He just hasn't been coming to class. I'll tell him that you came by. Let her in. Yeah, let her in. Do it. Oh, Kathy. Shit. Where have you been? Kathy, come here. - You okay? - Yeah. You okay? Come here. Come here. Hey. Talk to me. Fuck, I missed you. Mike, we got to get going. - You okay? - Yeah, let's get out of here. Mike, we got to talk, huh? Okay. Hey, we got to get going. I'm gonna be back in a few hours. The fuck you will. You're coming with me to see Tony. No, the fuck you will. Sit the fuck down. Sit down! Sit the fuck down! - You let go of me! Sit down! You let go of me. Let me go. I'm taking you to the hospital. Fuck. No, no, let's just get out of here. - Are you kidding? - No, let's go. Come on, you're not okay. Oh, shit. How's the leg? Where you two going? - Mike. They're not going anywhere. I'm calling the cops. - No, no, no. - Hey, hey, hey. Easy, easy. Who the fuck is this, Mike? She's nobody. You got to get her out of here. Hey, shut the fuck up. Nobody is fuckin' leaving. You understand me? Mike. Here. Here, check her coat. There's nothing in it. Check it. Look. Lou, let her go. It's okay. You know Gina Abruzzi. Yeah, I know Gina Abruzzi. Gina and Mike, they're getting married. Gina's his girl. This girl is shit to him. Look at her, she's a WASP. You think I'd let my son marry a WASP? It's not gonna happen. Is it true? Just get her out of here. Get out of here. You're getting married. Ow. You know, this Oyster Bay route's become ... a big fuckin' pain in the balls for me. First you don't get along with my brother. Then Mike here gets jumped. So he says. Yeah, that's what he said. Mike, I want you to tell me what happened. Don't worry about anything. You're just here to be debriefed, you know, like a fuckin' astronaut. So I drive to Oyster Bay like I do every week, go pick up the bag. And this little fuckin' guy answers the door. Hey, is Todd here? Some guy I never seen before. And he's acting all weird like he's — like he's fuckin' deaf or something. Hey. And then Todd shows up and ... Thank you, Don. tells the little guy to give me the bag, and I leave. - Your package. - Awesome. But everything's a little weird, you know? And I'm on my way back. I'm at a stoplight. And this big SUV pulls up behind me, And these two black guys get out. They come up alongside my car. Next thing you know, I got a fuckin' gun in my face. And I could see it in his eyes right away. Let it go. He saw I was in drive. I knew I was dead, because he knew if I hit the gas, I'd run into the getaway car. Meanwhile, that's what I did ... And the other guy, he scooped up the bag. Then you went straight home. Yeah. You drove all that way with a bullet in your leg? Yeah. I mean, I was out of it. I — I stumbled up the stairs, and I — I passed out on the kitchen floor. That's where I found him. Anybody see you? No. You sure? 'Cause Mrs. Gattei said you took out her trash. I did see Miss Gattei, and — 'Cause see, the thing is, Mrs. Gattei said she didn't see any bullet hole. Exactly, I was hiding it. She doesn't see shit. Tony. Vinny, there's nobody here I can trust ... except for my brother, and Lou here thinks you got the bag, Mike. I mean, I don't know. What, call it intuition, Lou? Right. I agree. There's a fuckin' first. I got to say, Mike, I mean, I'm disappointed. I mean, your story is fuckin' thin. Is that the new one? Can I see it? That's a nice phone. My wife would like this. It's got a good screen. Who called? I don't know. You don't recognize the number? No. Who fuckin' called you? What the fuck's going on? 'Cause he called a lot, ten times yesterday. You don't know the number. Who called you? Huh? Lou. It was Lou's phone number. What's the matter, Lou? You looking for your phone? It's right here. Look, when all this shit came down, I called him a few times to see what was going on. That's all. There's calls on there from before Mike left Brooklyn. I want you to know it was not my idea. Shut the fuck up! Tone, you gonna believe this piece of shit over me? Come on, I'm your brother. Yeah. My own brother. You remember what Daddy used to say? I'm too old a cat to be fucked by a kitten. Tone, come on, you can't do this in front of everybody! Tony, come on! - Oh, shit. Oh, my God. Get ahold of yourself. I'm not gonna fuckin' kill you. Our business arrangement is too valuable. Mike, I'm sorry you had to see that. You're a stand-up guy. Now I want you to tell me, where's the bag? Someplace safe. All right, good. I'm glad to hear that. Wait, you lied to me? l — I had to keep it as an insurance policy. Who the fuck was I gonna give it to, Lou, huh? Vin, your son is smart. No. And no offense, but he's got ambition. Tell your father where he can find the bag. It's in the boiler room, behind the boiler, where they used to keep the coal, that little black door. This I don't forgive. I don't. Open it. I don't have the key. Your cutter has it. Straw and rocks. Where are the drugs? Diamonds. You think I'd have your son carry fuckin' drugs? Thank God for that, Tone. He deserves a cut. Pop, no. Don't worry. Mike will be taken care of. No. No. This kid ... he took a bullet for these. It's only fair he gets a cut. I just lost my brother, so don't you fuckin' lecture me about fuckin' fair! I just lost my brother! - Tony, it ain't right. - Vinny! Mike, get your fuckin' father out of here. Get him out of here. - That ain't — - Vinny! Get your fuckin' hands off of me! Let's go. He'll get over it. Oh, shit. Hey, Pop, I'm sorry. I know this is really fucked up. Hey, we're — we're both limpin', huh? What's wrong with you? Gina and I broke up. Well, don't be so gloomy, huh? You never know what'll come with the next roll of the dice. That got your attention. Put 'em the fuck — where did you get those? What the fuck did you do? What do you mean what'd I do? I knew you took the bag. Come on, you left a trail of blood ... right to the boiler, Einstein. I had to clean it up before anyone saw. I was thinking, "What the fuck were you doing down there? " Now I got a bag in my hands, a bag that you can get at a hardware store. When Todd didn't have the key, I knew that we had it made, because that meant that he didn't have a chance ... to count the diamonds. If you had to pick a time to lie to me, this was a good one, 'cause now I finally had ... a decent hand to play against Tony. Are you fuckin' crazy? Relax. You know who these people are. The guy killed his own fuckin' brother right in front of me. Christ. And then you, you have the fuckin' balls to ask him for one. That was so nice. I mean, come on. What are you laughing about? I was so proud of myself. I — I loved it. Oh, my God, I was like a king. Look, if you're gonna ask for it, they know you're not gonna take it. And remember me, I'm the guy that has no ambition. Fuckin' Tony. The more he put me down, the more he freed me. Look at that. So what are you gonna do with 'em? Question is ... what are you gonna do with them? You are gonna have to leave. You can't stay working for Tony. If you do, your life will be a short one. What about you? Hmm? Who the fuck's gonna take care of you if I'm gone? Don't push me, 'cause I got to warm up. Huh? Chuckie would be proud, I'm telling you. Put it up, put it up, put it way up. Oh, what? Come on, I seen guys do it all the time at — Look, you put a little grease ... on the lift of the back of the truck, you're down, right? Retired, you're in Miami at 50. You're telling me for four — for four years, I drove you around, and you're perfectly fuckin' fine? Yeah. Why the fuck didn't you tell me? What am I gonna do, tell everybody? Come on, there's rats everywhere. Come on. Told Chuckie, but — I'm your son for Christ's sake. I was ashamed at first, you know. What your mother would think. But after she was gone ... look, I couldn't — I couldn't work there any longer. If I would have worked there for another hour, I swear to God, I would have blown my fuckin' brains out, I'm telling you. You know what's funny? I've been faking it for so long, it actually hurts when I walk regular. Officially, you and l, we had a knock-down, drag-out. You left. Yeah, all right? Yeah. Gina said I'd never leave the neighborhood. Come here. Look at that. The neighborhood is leaving. Thank you. I'll be all right. Kathy. Kathy, wait a second. Kathy, wait, wait. I need to talk to you. Glad to see you're in one piece. We talked. I'm going to the airport. Wait. I want to go with you. What? I want to go to Florence with you. Why don't you go with your fiancée? It's a good place to honeymoon. Kathy, I had to do that for your own protection, okay? I had to say that so they'd let you go. I apologize. I — yes, I had a girlfriend, okay? That's true. We broke up. Good for her. - Kathy. - What, Mike? I'm sorry. You're sorry for what? For lying to me? For fucking me behind your girlfriend's back? Or are you just sorry you weren't man enough ... to tell me about her in the first place? What are you sorry for? You know what? Here. Take this. Now I don't have to ship it. Are we done? Can I go? What are you gonna do now? Right. Well, Reyerson said you should keep in touch, so ... I want to take a picture of you. Let me. I want you to look at me and say, "Fuck off. I don't love you." Do it.
