What are you doing, Tonio? - Open the door for me. - Did you take my bike down? How helpful you are! Go back home. Shall I put him into the car? - Let's go. - Are you crazy? Let's go away, hurry up! I'm going. What happened? I'm going crazy, will you tell me what happened? - How the fuck is he? - Shut up! It seems that he's fine. The doctor is examining him right now. He says he regained consciousness in hospital. Thank goodness. - It's our fault, you know it. - He's run over, and it's our fault? - Did he see the driver, the car? - I don't know. He said he saw a girl. Fucking bitch! She just took off! She could have killed the child! What a bitch! If I catch her, she'll pay for this! I told her I scratched the car while parking. - Am I disturbing you? - No, if you just keep quiet. What are you doing? A joint? She's rolling a joint and who knows how he is! He's in hospital. How do you know? They must have seen him from the truck. And maybe they also saw my license plate! But it's you who were driving. - What are you doing now? - Guess what! - Cinzia, wait! - I'm going, happy now? God has granted me my prayer! You'll always be a bitch! I cannot find the words to explain. It was coming from the same side as the sun, but it was a different light. The girl crossed the road and ran me over. I felt warm. Just like when you are close to a heater. Something even warmer, but not hot. - Then I felt fine. - Come on, Tonio, get up. Easy. I've already heard these things. It's like a trip into another dimension, isn't it, doctor? Does you head hurt? No, just a little, here. Let's see... The CT results are normal, but we'll keep him in observation. - I've been here for 24 hours! - You never say "no"! - "I never say no..." - I need some information. In this hospital, is there a boy who was run over? If you tell me his name, maybe I can help you. I don't know his name, but I saw him being carried away. I just want to know how he is. 2nd floor. When you exit the elevator, it's on your right. A girl inquired about the boy involved in the accident. She seemed a bit... I sent her to the ICU. Please wait here. Let's go. What's that, a werewolf? - A mutant. - Ah! I went to all newsstands, nobody seemed to have it! Whatever you may need, just tell me. And I'll buy it for you. Anything. - What's wrong? - "What's wrong?" Now I cannot even caress you? - Where are you going? - To the bathroom. Excuse me, lady! Stop! License # 00MTR. What do you want? The man in my room is snoring. - I cannot sleep. - Make some noises. - He'll stop snoring. - Or close his nose. - May I watch TV with you? - No. Shit! Who is it? Go out. What did you do? I touched him. He told me that after the accident he saw a beautiful light. Like those who say that... Yes, and then he did that thing. Can't you make a news report? Still there! Come, the doctor's here. I'll call you back later. I went to the police station, hopefully they'll catch her. Thankfully, she came to the hospital. Yet she's still a dishonest person, remember. Are you listening to me? - I didn't sleep last night. - She'll also pay for that. She'll pay for the hours of sleep you've lost. It's not because of the accident that I didn't sleep. - I didn't get hurt. - You didn't? Then we won't even sue her! On the contrary, we'll compensate her because she got scared! Weren't we going to uncle and aunt's? I have to stop here for 5 minutes, I'm late. Stay in the car, don't get out. Mr. Masi, good morning. I'm very sorry, I'm late. I've had many mishaps, the traffic was terrible. I was about to leave. You're lucky that my flight is at 2 PM. I had to pick up my son from the hospital, sorry. This way. Please. Can you imagine the wonderful view? A park will be created there. There'll be many trees. Whoever suggested building here should be strangled! If you don't do it, I will! I can give you max 300 million for the land. - I paid 400 million. - Who cares? It's a big deal. If I hadn't other projects, I'd work on this one myself. I know your situation. 350 million. You make a deal, and I recoup my expenses. We'll talk again about it in a month. Come on, Mario! Pass the ball! - Did you make them yourself? - Yes. - I'll take this to Pietro. - No, let me do it. This week I'll make the reservation, but you have to tell me now. You look pensive. What's the matter? Eat, you'll feel better. What are you looking at? Nothing. - Where are Giovanni and Tonio? - I bet they're playing Playstation. - Nino, can you please call them? - I obey. Did you hear what Laura said? Did you hear what Laura said before? She asked me about the cruise, next summer. If there is any problem... Because she has to make the reservation. What's the problem? It will be a different vacation. Turn it off and come downstairs. - Dad? - What? Do you know that Tonio saved a man's life in hospital? What are you saying? Since when do you have such an imagination? Leave him alone. He was insisting. Didn't you realize the others were making fun of you? I only told Giovanni, and he told everyone. - And why did you tell him? - Stop it! He has to learn, he's not a 5-year-old child! I don't want him to make a fool of himself. Tell me the truth: did it really happen? Now her son is Jesus Christ! And you could even believe it! He's not a pervert! But if you go around naked, they watch you! Gianfranco saw you braless this morning. Did he tell you what he did next? - What did he do to you? - To me... nothing. Perverts love to fantasize. He's not a pervert. You should dress more properly. And I don't believe that you sleep naked. Hi. What do you want? Aren't there other bars? The police delivered this; it's a summons. I'll change address, so I won't bother you anymore. You're not bothering me. I'm worried about you. - If you need anything... - Forget that I exist. Who was that woman? - Who? - Your mother, right? It's not true that she lives in England. - Didn't you grind any more coffee? - No. Why didn't you ask her to have you as a guest? We can only get so much from the insurance company. We should ask for more money. My son is shocked. He has hallucinations, and may need long time to return normal. - Not just excoriations! - But the medical report says... That doesn't count shit! He needs a psychological assessment. I want to know why he has such morbid fantasies now. He was perfectly normal before. - What kind of fantasies? - Nothing. We are ready. It's a mere formality, isn't? Obviously, the girl who went to the hospital... is the same one who ran him over. Your son saw the driver. If she's the same girl, he'll tell us. Now, please, sit down. Tonio, come. Can you see them? Don't worry, they don't know why they are here. It's none of them. Watch them better. The girl of the accident was bigger. Let's go. Do you get bullshitted so easily? Please watch your language. Your son didn't recognize her. Exactly! That means the exact opposite. He just wants to spite me. He's at a difficult age. He's stubborn like a mule! Should I slap him? - Calm down! - Yes, calm! - Why didn't you stop? - What? After you ran me over. - I don't know you. - l recognize you, instead. I can still tell them. I'm here with the boy's mom, the "miracle" boy. Don't make me waste time on bullshit. Yes, I'll make the news report. Yes, bye. "Miracle at Sta. Annunziata hospital" - Sorry. Well? It's a beautiful article, you're a very good journalist. - So many words... - And it's all true. Not just beautiful words, this is the truth. I spoke with the man saved by your son. He's now in Modena for other clinical tests, but when he's back, he'll come in person to thank your son. Supposing that Tonio really made a... My husband will refuse the interview. We don't even talk at home about the fact. I won't mention any name without your authorization. Tonio already did something similar before. They are back. Tonio! Hi, Pietro. Go to study. You've been on vacation enough. - Good morning. - Hello. - How did it go? - You always ask perfect questions! Your wife was kind enough to invite me for a coffee. - What do you sell? Vacuum cleaners? - No. I'm a journalist. I work for "Studio 100". And what the fuck are you doing in my house? - He was about to leave. - Yes, I'll take my organizer. See you. - I am very sorry. - Don't worry. - I'll let you know. - Yes, you have my number. - What's in your mind? - Do you let anyone screw you? - Did I ruin the situation? - You are crazy! Do only saints make miracles? Why are you asking me this question? Someone I know put his hand on a man who wasn't breathing anymore. And the man started breathing again. - Maybe he told you a lie. - No, he never lies. Put it there. - Here? - Yes. Here, it's OK. Let's take the other plants. This friend of mine was in hospital. Also the nurses thought he had a made a miracle. Maybe he had been to another dimension before. Did you see that in a film? It happened to me. Sit down. Madam, haven't you gone to a doctor yet? - I am in God's hands. - In God's hands! You should go to a doctor. Tonio, whether it's a miracle or not... it's a difficult to ascertain. But at your age you should play outside with your friends. - Come and play football with us. - I'm already playing elsewhere. What a bitch! - Why did you enter the bedroom? - I was lost in thought. I have to send a gift to a cousin for his Confirmation. Have you gone mad? Where did you grow up? You don't even know how to behave! There's a stink in here that can give me a headache. I've already booked a hotel room. Who is it? Who is there? Will you stop pranking people? A real massacre, for a stolen moped! - It wasn't stolen! - He gave him one hell of a beating! - Come on, guys! - No! Do me a favor: come to my place. Here's the number, I'll take you there. What do you want? You must heal someone, as you did at the hospital. - I didn't do anything. - Your cousin told me everything. - I'm talking to you! - Leave me alone. You did it for a stranger you couldn't care less about. Thanks anyway, you asshole. You just need to follow the order. The operations are always the same. Multiplication, division, subtraction and addition. But you need to start from the parentheses first. If you don't solve them, you cannot go on... Solito! Will you pay attention, so you can catch up? About the parentheses... How many goals did you score? I don't remember. - Bye, see you tomorrow at school. - Bye. Hi. I've brought you a small gift, to thank you. I wanted to stop, but that guy got angry. He forced me to get back into his car. I even came to your hospital to see how you were. What's that? I recorded some of my favorite songs for you. - Going back home on foot? - Yes. If I had had a helmet, I could have given you a ride. No, it's just a block away. I'm really sorry. I haven't been able to sleep since that day. I just wanted to tell you how things really went. I immediately found the right school. I was lucky. And you were lucky, too: you didn't get hurt. You're afraid that I may change my mind. That's why you came. But you won't, will you? My father thinks I had a shock. But now you are fine, you've even gone back to school. I thought I'd been to another dimension, and that I'd gotten some powers from there. Really? What powers? Like being able to save sick people. How weird! Two days ago I read an article about similar cases. It said that some people, after an accident, discover special abilities. It was written in a scientific magazine. What happened to you? Maybe it was destined to happen. So that you could discover your ability to help others. I hadn't never driven on that road before. - Do you still have that magazine? - Yes, but I have to look for it. - OK, I'll come to take it... where it is. - OK. I work at the "Pitagora" bar. Do you know it? So I'll also offer you an ice-cream. OK, bye. Hey! Come here! I didn't say anything to Grandpa. Shall we make a surprise visit? - Don't be so sure that I'll heal him. - Just try. Grandpa! Grandpa, you didn't eat anything. If you don't eat, you won't get better. Tonight I'll bring you a steak. Good morning. Good morning. He's a classmate. He has to do something for you. He'll touch you where you have pain. He's already healed a man. The doctors thought he was dead, but now he's fine. I've understood. Did you finish your homework? - Or you haven't even started yet? - You don't believe it. Let him put his hand here for 5 minutes. I'm curing myself with my medications. I'm better, don't worry. Prepare some Chamomile tea. I know my grandson is a bit retarded, but he doesn't deserve to be made fun of. Do you understand? I'll just try. I had an accident... I saw a light. Maybe it was God. And now I have this thing in my hands. Did you see God? Then you are retarded, too! This is what happened. There was always a stray dog, down in the street. It was nice. Tonio had got fond of this dog. One morning my husband was driving in reverse, didn't see the dog, and he ran it over. The dog seemed dead. I remember it as if it were yesterday. Tonio saw everything and ran towards the dog. He touched it. One minute later, the dog was fine. Maybe there have been other circumstances in which Tonio has exerted his... I haven't opened this bed for long time I don't know if it's comfortable. But you can stay in the other room, my bed is large. It's perfect, thanks. Tomorrow I'll look for a hotel room. I don't need anything else. Why don't you stay here? We'll keep each other company. If you hope that I'll stay, you're miscalculating. I know I shouldn't have gone away. But in all these years I've always thought of you. And every time I called your school, the nuns told me you were fine and lively. I didn't give a damn then, and even less now. Can I go to the bathroom or do you need to go? - Did you see her? - Yes. - What did you do? - I touched her ass. I asked for some water, and then I went out. What's she like? As soon as she saw me, she fell in love. See? She's looking for me. Shall we follow her? - Shall we go? - Does this thing work? This thing has never failed me and never will! - Come on! - It's not a Ferrari! It works fine, right? - What do we do now? - I don't know. Let's go away, come on! - Go away, if you want to. - And you? - I'm staying. I'll reach you later. - OK, but don't... - Hi. - Hi. - I was in the neighborhood and I saw you. - You were in the neighborhood? I always come here to fish. And your friend always gives you a ride? He's good, I didn't think he would be able to follow me. Since you are here, sit down. In your opinion, does this fit me well? Yes. Shall we a take a bath? - I don't have a bathing suit. - Neither do I. We'll take a bath in underpants. - It's not the same thing. - I'll turn, so I won't see you. - And then, when we go away? - In trousers, without underpants. - You don't have the guts to do it? - Last year I did it even earlier. Let's see. - Don't watch. - No, I'm not watching you. You shouldn't trust me. Let's play a trick on the guy who didn't want me to stop after the accident. We'll just take 2 minutes. Your turn. What do you want to write? Asshole. Harder! His mother's coming. - I haven't finished it. - Let me do it. Let's go. You still have to practice. Madam! You, stupid! Today I was really hungry. Isn't it strange? According to the doctors, I would need enteral feeding now. Have you finished your coffee? Do you believe me that last night I slept better? I just pray that you don't suffer. Pray that I survive! Stop it. I wish I were you; I would make a lot money! 20 euros each time! I don't know if I'm really helping your Grandpa. Now you'll see. You won't get tired, will you? Go back home. I made the bed. You cannot stay here alone. Live with it. Accept it. I won't tell you again. Fuck off! What happened? Was he tested at school? Don't know. They never test me at school, they just give me "Zero". Tell Tonio the poem your Grandpa taught you. "Don't piss in the wind, or you'll be unhappy". "Don't crap on thorns, or you'll come to a bad end". "Don't scratch with glass, or you'll take it up the..." - I can teach you that poem. OK? - Yes. Repeat after me. Did you see that he feels better? Don't kiss me. - Why do you say that he feels better? - Because I've seen it. Grandpa wants to know if tomorrow you'll visit him again. As long as you don't kiss me! Good morning. In this city with 300,000 inhabitants, there are also desperate persons who now see, with different eyes, a boy who was simply a fellow-townsman. These persons, driven by extreme necessities, would like to see, meet, and touch this boy. I was in a bar with the Councilor, and I had to hear that idiot's bullshit! Thankfully, the TV was partly hidden. I was going to tell you, Pietro. But you are seldom at home, and often intractable. Maybe it's because I'm concerned about serious issues. And what are such issues? - Either you're a saint, or you'd better go! - Go away! What are you doing up there? Don't you have a home? I studied with a classmate. I've just come back. - Couldn't you study on your own? - The teacher says it's better that way. Do you know your mother's latest? She told someone, even madder than she is, that you are a kind of saint. And he said everything on TV. Fancy an ice-cream? No. Many times I've thought of that dog. Remember? The dog you healed. - The one down in the street. - I didn't heal it. It was laying on the ground, but it wasn't hurt. It's since the accident I've been able to do such things. It was also written in a scientific magazine. After an accident, it can happen. OK, I said that, but maybe I'm wrong. But you can tell the journalist what happened. He's good. He wants to interview you. Would you like it? Stay there. Come here, Ottorino. - Stay there, I'll take it. - Come here, sweetie. - You'll kill it that way! - And then my husband will kill me! Give us a hand. You are young. She's my daughter. Her husband's "pecker" has flown away. That "pecker" flew away long time ago! Try to catch it. We've been trying for an hour like crazy. Come on, try. Good! Let me see it. Have you moved here recently? I've been here for 2 months. I lived in Pavia before. We are not from Taranto, but from the province of Lecce. I came here when I was still pregnant. I fled home. Then I found accommodation with a family. - Do you have a job now? - I'm looking for one. As a cook or as a physiotherapy assistant. Give me the canary. The canary. Thank you. - Don't let it fly away again. - Don't worry. See you, madam. - Where's the boss? - That way. I'm renovating an apart-hotel nearby. I was considering a partnership with you. At 50%. I'd take care of renovation, construction and sales, and your net profit would be 50%. Well? If it's about money, forget it. I have many problems and little demand. - Ask the housing association. - It's really a deal. And I prefer a friend to take advantage of it. We haven't met in a long time, and it shows. I'd never take advantage of a friend. - Look what he's doing! - Alfredo, it's not what you think. You can understand, it's a difficult moment for me. It's for my wife. Can you lend me at least 10 million? Forget it, Pietro. See you. By the way, you've never seen my son. I named him "Pietro", like you, even if nobody liked it. - We already met in your house. - Unfortunately. Do you have a minute? Isn't my wife in? You'd better talk with her. I need to talk to you. The thing is very serious. Not local TVs, but RAl 2 itself! They want to interview your son, but both parents must authorize it. You won't ever have my authorization. - It's an opportunity you cannot miss! - Maybe for you. OK, fair enough, you need to think it over. This is my number, call me anytime. I understand, the situation is difficult. You'd be the first to understand. Fuck off! Where's your Grandpa? He went out for a walk. He hadn't gone out since my birthday, 2 months ago. - Gigi, how are you? - I'm all right. - Good morning. - Look at the beautiful things I have! Squid, gilt-head bream, bass... Anything you want, very fresh fish. - I wanted some white sea bream. - I've run out of it. - Come back next week. - OK. Taranto mussels! 2.5 Kg for 5000 lire! The neighbors are nice, ordinary people. Yes, we are fine. You know how these things are. One needs time. She has a difficult character, one has to know how to deal with her. Sometimes I miss you, just a little. OK, enough said. - Let's make some sauce. - Not for me, I've already eaten. Come on, I'll make some pasta. I bought some sausages and mushrooms. When I lived in the North, I also worked as a cook. - Didn't he provide for you? - He... who? He never gave me a gift, or a necklace, or a bracelet. Just many beautiful words! Not a single display of love. Now he's calling me asking me to return to him. He can forget about it! I told him: "I'll stay with my daughter." You can say all the bullshit you want. OK, then I'll make the sauce tomorrow. The other bed was uncomfortable. Good night. Hello? I'd like to speak to Mr. Bonallevi. Good morning, this is Pietro Solito, the boy's father. No, thank me later. I'd like to know more about the RAl program. Do they only want to interview him? Can I expect a compensation? You've fixed it, at last. He will be happy, you'll see. Better late than never. I talked to him, this morning. I told him that you love him. Even if you are nervous sometimes. Of course I love him, and he knows it. I'm going to Laura for the sofa slipcover. Tell her that I'll give her the check tomorrow. I'm going to the bank today, and... By the way, I need a man to move the table. - So we'll make more room. - OK. I've smeared your hair. Never mind. Let me know when you go on TV, so I'll see you. You'll become famous! They just want to know what happened at the hospital. I don't even know that I'm visiting my friend's Grandpa. - Nobody knows. - l do. Now he's better, really. It seems strange, but it's true. Do you really believe that impossible things can happen? You don't? I don't know. Shall I wake him up? He's holding it tight. - Booo! - You pretended to be asleep! - I came later today. - No problem! Tell me about your friend. - You are engaged! - She's not my girlfriend. - She's too old. - You're a cuckold! I can introduce you to her. I'll ask her if she wants to come here. Venice? It was so long ago! There, on the bridge? I would have gladly thrown you down. To the mountains, no, definitely. It's too cold. Yes, the snow is wonderful, but... I told you: I'm not going back. The pasta is getting cold. - Sorry, he wouldn't let me go. - The pasta is yours. It's enough, thanks. I'm not hungry. What did the "fatso" have to say? True, you used to call him "fatso". Why? - He's never been fat. - When I was 8, he looked fat to me. He wants to come here to take me back. And you believe his lies? Yes, sure, I've called the doctor. One of his coworkers at ILVA died of cancer, too. Thank you for calling. Yes, greet your family for me. Bye. But maybe... he ate something that gave him indigestion. He didn't eat anything, how can it be indigestion? - Is he sleeping? - No. I'll lay my hand on you until the doctors come. - I'll come back tomorrow, then. - Don't worry. Watch out, sweetheart! This is beautiful. Isn't it? - It depends on your tastes. If you like it... - It's not for me. - Which one do you prefer? - They are all beautiful. This one is beautiful. I also need a necklace. - How much do you want to spend? - 250 euros. - What kind? Gold or silver? - A nice one. - It's just a small gift. - You hadn't to. - Do you like it? - It's wonderful. You are wonderful. You are always beautiful, with or without it. I'm going for a cigarette. Are you still here? I hope you'll find someone who can make you happy. Pack your bags, hurry up. - Your friend doesn't work here anymore. - Why? Is she on vacation? No, she took half million lire from the cash register! - Do you have her address? - Here. There's also her number. But you'd better burn it. - Pull it from there. - A whole nother thing! Besides, this color looks better on TV. I'm used to the previous one that... ...matched with the furniture. Tonio is back. Auntie has been waiting for you. You don't even say "Hi"? I know you are important now, but... Why so late? What happened? - I had to finish an essay. - Couldn't you let us know? You are too demanding. This boy is capable of much more. I don't want to be interviewed anymore. - Is he kidding? - Maybe he's nervous. What's wrong with him now? - Maybe he doesn't feel like it anymore. - He seemed happy. Don't be naughty. I have an agreement with them, I cannot break it. They can interview someone else. - Shall I take this away? - Yes, sorry, but now... - Now I believe it, so? - Don't lie. I'm not stupid like Mom! Do as I say. Is that your way to calm him down? Who the fuck takes care of my calm? You forgot to return Laura's money! What's the matter? Is it for the interview? It's easy, you only have to tell what happened. As if you were speaking with a friend. I told everyone you would go on TV. Do you want me to feel ashamed? Maybe I didn't really resuscitate that man in hospital. - Maybe I didn't. - Maybe, maybe... You think too much, Tonio. You must stay calm and trust your mom. The procession was much more heartfelt when I was young. Let me tell you something. They offered 50 million at the auction! Isn't that devotion? That means a different thing. That there are still too many assholes around. Who is this? Did he come out of an Easter egg? - There are too many assholes in here. - Who would they be? You idiot! Get out of here! We're talking about serious things. - I wasn't referring to you. - There are 3 gentlemen here. Sit down. - Hello? - Cinzia, it's me. - It's me! - I've understood, let's see if you understand! Don't piss me off! Who gave you my number? Hurry, it's late! We must know about Pyrrhus and Epirus... We live in Taranto, so talk about Pyrrhus. Wrong classroom? - Hasn't Sarino come to school? - No, he's absent. Did something happen? Where are you going? Stop! Stop! Don't make me curse! Stop! Hello? Yes, this is he. What happened? Tonio, son! I didn't expect it of a good boy like you. Why on earth did you bite Giuseppe's hand? He was just doing his duty when he stopped you. Good morning. Sorry for asking you to come, but we couldn't let him go out alone. He just couldn't wait until the end of the lesson. I, too, lost my grandfather when I was his age. Considering the situation, we understand his behavior. Thank you. Tell me where you are going. At 2 PM the TV crew are coming, just for you. At 2 PM I'll be at home, don't worry. If I understand correctly, a friend's grandfather has died. He must have been old. Why do you feel so bad? Did you know him well? I'm sorry about yesterday. I've been confused lately. It can happen to be slapped sometimes. At times you don't know what you're saying. What's the matter? I told you I'll do the interview. But it's useless, you and mom are separating anyway. Why do you say so? It's not true that I make miracles. Are you a relative? The relative from Pescara? The lawyer? He often talked about you. I knew him since I was a child. I'm not a relative. I've nothing to do with this. Don't be sad, son. I have to go now. You can stay, if you wish. After the interview, I want to shoot the scene of the procession with many details. Eyes, feet, faces of bystanders... I'd like an almost abstract vision. - OK, abstract. - Last year we shot it that way. - Do you mind? - No, at all. What a pleasant smell! I crumbled it a bit taking it out of the pie dish, but it's good. - Thanks, but I'm not hungry now. - It's flourless, very light. - Really? - Here they are. Where's Tonio? Good morning, Mr. Solito. I'm sorry you've come here in vain. But there won't be any interview. No interview here, no interview with my son. - What happened to Tonio? - Nothing. - I hope you're kidding. - I'm not kidding at all! Everybody knew it was bullshit, and you'll be paid anyway. - Nice meeting you, see you. - What's the matter with you? - See you! - What's the matter with you? You cannot decide this alone. Where's the child? I've understood. This is not fair. If you're afraid you won't get the money, here's the check. Let's end this farce Where's the boy? Am I clear now? What money? You've never given a damn before, and now you want to know? I've been looking for 10 million to return it to your sister. I didn't know which way to turn, I couldn't even sleep at night. I was going mad, shit! Keep calm. - You'll discuss that with your wife later. - Please go away. What have you done? - Please go way or I'll kick you out. - Let go of my arm! - Fuck off, you asshole! - You bastard! You told me a lot of lies! Only lies! How long have you been lying to me? Look where you've taken me, you idiot! Let's take everything and go. Sir, misunderstandings can happen. Did you know from the beginning that it wouldn't work? No. I believed it, too. Don't worry, Grandpa was happy when you were here. I think that, before dying, he saw the same light you saw. I don't remember that light anymore. Grandpa said you have to say something to your friend. I don't know if she's still my friend. - What should I tell her? - Nothing. - Tell me. - Nothing, I just wanted to play a trick on you. If you had asked: "What?" I'd have answered: "Touch my dick". Grandpa didn't tell me anything, because the doctor didn't let me in. English translation by YRR.
