Wait. I won't. Stop it, Michéle. I'm waiting for you. You'll pay for it. I want you to. I won't I'm busy. It's legal. I'm telling you it's legal. Shall we go for the photocopy... tomorrow? You know I can't go alone. Michéle, the photocopy. She wanted to. It was she who wanted to. They can't back out... It's legal. First, come here. That'll do, Michéle. That'll do. That's enough. Stop, I beg you. It was too much, Michele, my beauty, my beloved... Give it back to me, you slut... She thinks only of her own pleasure. Give me back that brooch. You disgust me. It wasn't time for the chair. It's over. I won't obey you any more. You're just a slut. Everything's still to be clone... and we don't even know what day it is. It's true they can't do anything, isn't it? We've only got to go for the photocopy. Won't you, Michéle? Look at me. Michéle, I beg your pardon. She was so brave. She stood up on her hind legs. Be quiet. After darkness comes dawn... But night wanted to last. She jabbed... Then dawn came... and she went to sleep, bleeding, on the soft grass. And then the wolf ate her. And then, after the wolf ate her? You know it, you know you bothered me, You slut. And you are... You want another? What will they say about us? That everything is in extreme disorder. Be quiet. Don't tempt me. Come here. What's wrong? What did I say? I said everything's in extreme disorder. Come and see, come to the kitchen, things are all over the floor. Go on, hit me. Go on, hit me, you brute. Instead of our being paid. No pay for three years. Why should Madame pay us, since everything's a mess? And what do we do about Mademoiselle, after what she's done for us? You idiot. Whereas we could have had the photocopy. You swine. They're quite right. How could anyone say they were wrong? Who was it who was unbearable? Monsieur and Madame are better then their servants say they are. Monsieur and Madame are nice, when they want to be. They do have many good qualities. They're thirsty for virtue, so they drown themselves in wine. The masters have their reasons. Madame is penniless. It's true. She doesn't own anything. Shut up. Monsieur's a smooth talker. Monsieur talks drivel. So do you. Keep quiet. Yet it's true. He's not so bad. He's not. And Madame has style. Enough already... Come tomorrow and we'll be saved. Why not? I'll come. And meanwhile you'll start cleaning up a little. What are you saying? You want to leave me alone? Say you won't. What's under the sink? Two full rubbish-bins, a broken clock, knives and forks, paper, cans, pans, plates... - What's in the closets? - Everything's outside. We should have begun sooner. Start in the kitchen. - I'll do the bedroom. - I won't go to the kitchen. For once you'll go without me. That's an order. Cow. I want to visit the house one last time... alone... to see what I'll never see again... what our life has been... the days of our life. I beg you. They're not wrong. Monsieur is nice, Madame's not at all bad. No, no, Michéle. Tell me what you want. Shall I start again? What they want is legitimate. Anyone would do the same. - You hear? - Be quiet. Don't leave me. Didn't you lock up the chickens? Go on, go on, little brat. You locked them up They've all laid. Go get the eggs, slut. Still, they can't kill each other. They can't, since Elisabeth signed. The chickens now belong to us. They can't. You've got to have confidence. You must believe in your sister. They'll pay the arrears. They'll pay- - They'll be able to pay. - They won't be able to. How often have they already fired us? No, be quiet. The old lady's shrewd. Mademoiselle and her husband will make up. Business is business. Then I'll beg Madame. You hear? I'll beg her. The crackling gravel, footsteps on the stairs, and the ditches, the soft grass. We'll sleep in the ditches. We'll stay together. Calm down, Michéle. Where's the letter? In the desk? The official letter about the deed... You1lsee, they won't be able to sell. What if they didn't come back? Maybe they'll have an accident. Please... I want you to get better. What do people call a letter that doesn't arrive? When there's proof it was sent and didn't get there? It's called a letter that went astray. Come and look at the fog. You know it's foggy at night in October. Did you see how milky the moon was? The birds all sleep in the fog. But, Michele, when it happens on purpose, because it was stolen, when there's proof it was stolen? What I am saying is very serious. I know... I know exactly what it's called. It's called tampering with the mail. Isn't it odd Mademoiselle went with them? Perhaps it was to reunite her and Philippe? Possibly. It wasn't right of Mademoiselle to go see her ex-husband. He's been trying hard to arrange things. But the letter I tore up before, the official letter, it was signed by the notary. His address was written by hand, no letterhead. A notary's letter without anything printed on it. What do you think of that? It's impossible. There they are. There was no way of my doing otherwise. Who of us can swear unmixed devotion? And are we sure such devotion is only for the good of others? So I'm staying, yes, I'm staying. I'm not staying only because of you. In any case, I'm staying, for my parents' sake and yours. I'm giving up my personal plans. I was deeply shocked, disappointed. It's serious to commit oneself body and soul. I prefer to think it's all over between him and me. You know that you mean a lot to me and that I desire your welfare. How are you? She looks a bit pale. Now I know. I'm happy, happy no longer to be wrong. And so now I'm back. My dear trees and the whole setting of our life. This house. My big drawing-room and the piano... I'm going straight to that faithful friend. Do help with the suitcases. It's better that I keep away. I'll see you later. Excuse my grandiloquence. Did Elisabeth tell you we haven't eaten yet? We no longer sleep, Sir. We no longer sleep. We no longer sleep, Madame. We're deeply grieved. We count on you. Could we have a nice pumpkin soup? I don't know, but she doesn't decide without you. You haven't the right. You haven't the right. You've picked the wrong time. - You're worse than she. - Be quiet, calm down. We've been living here like animals. Nonsense. I think you returned early on purpose. So as to surprise us. What will happen? Are the beds made? We've been making merry. You were away and these are our last clays. What do you mean? I don't know what will happen. Why did you return early? Let's go in and discuss things. Don't try to get out of it. If you won't carry it, she can. Why can't we serve you in your rooms? That would be nice. Why do you want us to eat in our rooms? I won't coddle you the way Elisabeth does. Have you washed since we left? You don't look it. You wicked woman... You wanted her to take the big bag. You know she has a bad back. That's absurd. I prefer insults. You realised my sister was fed up. Giving her the heavy bag. We won't tolerate it. Be quiet. It's starting again. André, please. Keep quiet, you wretch. It's my sister, my little sister. Did you hurt yourself? You've overtaxed my little sister's strength. Go away, go away, don't look. Go inside. Elisabeth, don't go up. How awful. The handkerchiefs and nightgowns. It's the empty suitcase. Elisabeth, please, don't cry. They don't deserve your tears. Don't temp fate. You're defying me. Go to your room. All right, but I've just driven 100 miles, and I'd like something to eat. My child... She's not her child. I'll follow you. I dare not look. You've almost spoiled things and allowed us to be ruined. You've acted badly. A lot could be said. Lots of things. Don't worry. I'll carry the bag up. And it's not empty. You said it's full of linens. It's heavy. Let go of me. André, help. - It's got to stop. Drop the bag. - It was empty. Perhaps it was. I want to undress. I almost choked. Everything's falling to pieces. Yes, but come upstairs, my clear. Did Fernand come every clay? No. I'll tell him to come Friday. A man should have been here. He wanted to weed the garden. He could have. Let's go down. Hurry, I'm very tired. All right... What a fine car, and so cheap to run. This drawer's been opened. Uses practically no petrol. Practically none at all. I've got to rewash. I simply can't find things. Go down right away. It's late. There's too much to do. Look. I've got to rewash. Go down and keep an eye on them. You've got to manage. I ordered groceries before we left. So I'm more in debt to the grocer. I wonder how I'll be able to pay. I was hoping to have pumpkin soup. The fridge is full. Our not having a fridge is no reason for sarcasm. I was joking, Madame. That'll do. Cook some canned food. There isn't any. You left me no money. An oversight... been going on for years. The cupboards were full when I left. Let's have preserved goose. What do you think we ate for nine days? We had to keep alive, Madame. We couldn't live on sunshine. I never thought you lived on sunshine. Marie-Louise, turn around. You've been drinking. André, look at her. I think the grocer didn't come. Elisabeth's right. He didn't come. If I were he, I wouldn't have. Let's not get acrimonious. The girls had to eat while we were away. I'm sure they've cooked a meal. But we arrived unexpectedly. Then they'll prepare something. They work, mother. You're free to refuse Philippe, but we beg you to reconcile. By helping the girls you're spoiling our last chance. Preventing us from selling, it's impossible, Elisabeth. You realise it, don't you? Of course she does. Everyone realises it. Elisabeth must free herself, must remarry and have children. I'll have a look at the wine-barrels. Join me in the cellar, Gertrude. You're mad. Go on. - Come here, you fool. - Leave me alone. You dirty pig. I'm telling you they're drunk. I can just hear her: they're drunk because they're unhappy. That Elisabeth. Things aren't so bad. We'll manage. I'll sell my property and we'll be well off. I've never told you that the house has termites. Well, that can be dealt with. They won't go as fast as I. I must find a buyer who'll give a good price, including the vintage. One moment. Gertrude, come quick, come quick. My glasses... I've lost my glasses. Here they are. Your glasses. What a catastrophe. The whole year's vintage. Idiot. Kick those monsters out tonight or I'll do it myself. You fool. How can I if I can't pay them? We owe them three years' wages. Gertrude, my dear, forgive my violence. What a frightful revenge. What intelligence. They want to prevent the sale by making me lose the 6000 litres of wine included in the deal. Our fate is in your hands, Gertrude. Don't say anything. Don't show your feelings. They can do further damage. We've got to sell first. I promise, I swear. I won't say anything, absolutely nothing. But imagine how easy it would have been to sell if Elisabeth hadn't given those girls the chicken-coop and buildings. Taking a part of your property and giving it to those monsters. But you know I've had the thing officially annulled. I don't dare look. God, what happened? The sugar bowl in the water. MY tapestry. André, the tapestry in the sink. Why? Why that fish? It should have been eaten. My set of china. André, the cake-set... They didn't do it on purpose. Mere blunders... The rest is intact. It's me, Gertrude. I won't say anything. No, I won't. Don't look, don't look. No, no. Let's go to the dining-room. We've got to eat. Let's eat and go straight to bed. - Let's not spoil things. - Yes, but... What's going on? What are you doing? I'd never have... Look at her. Look what you've clone to her. My sister, my little sister... Have pity on her youth. Do you want to destroy her? A doctor... I want a doctor... I want a doctor for my little sister. If we're so clumsy it's because we're so unhappy. There are rights we can't give up. We want to be able to go on living, hoping, and you can't stop us. Do you want to destroy us? If you do, you're monsters... you're wild beasts. Look at the state she's in. It's burning. Throw it out. Take other potatoes. Put her on the couch. And come back. No, I want to stay here. Most of them were unpeeled. You haven't looked after your sister. Is it possible? Can you forgive and excuse us? Please let bygones be bygones. What an odd idea... pancakes. Monsieur likes them. What else is there? - It would have been quicker. - What? Pancakes. Why did you return early? We were expecting you Friday. It's nice to get home, isn't it? You don't answer. - Yes, but admit... - I admit, I admit. I must change my stockings. Have you seen my feet? How awful. I'd lend you mine, but they're dirty. - Forget it. When I think how, in my family, we made pancakes at my uncle's home. If Mademoiselle had wanted, there'd be a man here. You're forgetting Monsieur. Excuse me. What have I said... It's the excitement. How can we do anything normally after what we know? I'm so upset that I can't walk straight. Answer me, Madame. Control yourself. We'd be upset if you inspected things now. Yes, we were rather negligent. But starting now, things will be different. I asked you for other eggs. Be quick. You know the time? Elisabeth, please get a half-dozen eggs. Please hurry. The cup is overflowing. It won't bring you luck. I wasn't born to tip rubbish. I don't enjoy soiling myself with your filth, stepping in your muck, emptying Monsieur's spittoon... You can't imagine what's going to happen. You'll see strange things. You're impudent. With your background one doesn't become a servant, even in an honourable family. All the same, your will isn't law. It depends on circumstances. Because of your pancakes, I'm not to look after my sister. You've made her sick. Pancakes at ten o'clock. Elisabeth, go get some eggs. First get your father. I can eat late. Come with me, dear. You need other eggs, yes or no? The air will do you good. Of course, since we need other pancakes. We have chickens to have eggs. You're vile. You're monsters. We're going for eggs, to our chicken-coop... What's going on? Pancakes are nourishing and will do us all good. Pancakes are good. The situation's clear: we'll all eat together. But we need some ingredients. Michele and Marie-Louise will go get the eggs. We're late. Do we need excuses? André, a million francs worth of wine. Realise the situation. To be interesting she played up to you. Yes, she played up to you. I feel good. Look at the new spider-webs. They're as thick as linen. Tell me I'll fall asleep. Look. Look around. It's all yours. It's all mine. It's all lovely. You're my dear little monkey. And you can sleep in peace. Tell me we're happy here. We'll wait for dawn. We'll see it coming through the cracks. Is that you? Listen to me. You've got to go right back at once. Please. There may be trouble. Listen to me. Let's assume you can listen... The pancakes have to be made. Or I can make them myself. Where are the eggs? There they are. May I? You really must go back. You don't realise what you're doing. - Please. - Go away. You annoy us. We're resting. Clear out. Will we wait till 1a.m.? Why are you still here? You pig. Why are you pestering us? Let us alone, you evil woman. You slut. Get out of here. We're in our own home.. - It's ours, it's ours. - What? She calls her maids and spits hot air. Imbecile. Get out of here, you don't want us to eat when you're away. She owes us three years' pay. That's the limit. We're the landlords here, the legal owners. Wanting to eat pancakes at this hour. Mustn't overload your stomach, slut. It's you who don't belong here. And watch out for the chicken dirt, Madame. They're fiends. They've widened the cracks, they've damaged the plaster, they uncorked the wine... 6000 litres. A million francs worth. Come here, come, let me stroke you. They're too outrageous to describe. You talking about my sister? We don't ask what you do at night. It's infernal. You oughtn't say that. You think plaster holds your house up? It's all falling to pieces. - There are termites. - No, no, please. Sneeze, and the house caves in... Wipe your nose in the cellar. It's only about pancakes. Speak to them. Isn't the chicken-coop ours? What an inspiration. I just thought of it: why not compensate you? Yes, that's the solution. We'll pay you the value of the coop and adjoining lands. I'll talk with André. Won't I, Elisabeth? Speak up. The property would be attached. Let's be strictly legal. Well, say something, Elisabeth. We prefer the property to money. We prefer it. You can't appreciate its beauty. I won't discuss the matter. You're reasonable and intelligent. In whose name are you speaking? - What do you mean? - You're only the second wife. How can you talk of legality? I knew it. She has nothing. No, nothing. You own nothing.. - She said she owned it. - You have no legal right. How do you know? Her maids kick her out. It belongs to Monsieur and Elisabeth. Who's dumb but not bad. We'll be attached and must sell at once. No, you mustn't sell. Think of the law-suits for hidden defects. Yes, I know. But we've made repairs. You've camouflaged. - I only came to ask you... - I can help you out. I can save you all. You're unaware of my resources. I don't understand you. We can arrange everything. - Am I stupider than you? - I never said that. She said we were depraved. I'm talking seriously. The business can flourish again. We'd group the clients. We'd work together. I repeat: we can arrange everything. I talk better than I scrub. I can talk to people and can spell. Go and talk to Monsieur. And tell him that what's clone is clone, and if he forgets about legality, we have people in our family, who'll see to it that it's respected. The eggs. Bring the eggs. Monsieur's waiting for the pancakes. What's going on? What about the pancakes? Gertrude, what's going on anyway? No, don't. I love you. The board has met. The chairman has finally understood. All right, so she came. It's over, Michéle. You're lying. I'm happy -- Love me. Everyone here must respect Madame, my dear wife. She's a worthy woman. And it's right of Elisabeth to desire your welfare. But I must see to it that even the best intentions do not do more harm than good. You must believe the old man. Trust the experienced old man. You won't regret it. There are good plans and bad plans. It's for me to deal with things. Therein lies my honour, my sacred task. Work is what counts. It can achieve miracles. I'm sure you've understood me. You're both plucky girls. And you know that bad temper is bad for work. No, what are you doing? No, no, not that. No, Michéle. He had a hard life, like all artists. But his glory is assured. His A-minor prelude is the loveliest. It will be part of me to my dying day. You're not doing it on purpose? You play badly because you're moved. No, it's because I lack skill. No, it's because you're too artistic. It's mighty good. We should have stopped at Ferjac. Do you hear me? There's a nice inn there, neat and tidy. I'll have a bit more. It was very good. If you'd wanted to, you could have played Mozart, but you never bothered. What a pity. With such fingers and your artistic sense. Michéle, where are you going? Stop, Michéle, don't leave me. Let Michele get the potatoes. You should have had some soup. I need to see him. He's always been very friendly. I'll have some more soup. We'll arrange it by letter. My sister doesn't want any soup. She doesn't want any. Marie-Louise, the soup's very good. We're together, we should share. If they were so hard up, how did they buy a new car? I met their cousin, who confirmed what I knew. - Georgette's sorry. - No, she's... She's very happy that way. There was bread. She did it on purpose. You know what Elisabeth did? What's the matter, Elisabeth? His first wife was my cousin. In any case, Sophie Verley brought sixty million. It certainly saved him. It doesn't seem to me that Robert married for money. If he did such a low thing, it brought him no luck. - The child's blind. - That's blasphemous. God knows how to punish. Human beings aren't merchandise, aren't money. I didn't marry Philippe for his money. That's what I meant. - Who said you did? - This is a painful discussion. We've been back less than two hours after my giving up the idea of going back to Philippe. I raise the question: do women have freedom? Gertrude and I love each other. Where do you think you are? In my own home, and that of my late mother. But I was talking of something else. What is life without resources? What is a woman without love? Facts are facts. We're millions in the red. Things are bad for us. The foundations are giving way. After all, have I ever scoffed at love? It was I who just brought you to your husband. But what will happen if you refuse even the alimony he offers you? You're free, of course, but we're sinking. I've offered many times to help, to regroup the clients. We've got to help each other. Control yourself. Realise your position. I'd like to express myself clearly. It's the human problem that counts. No one is born with his fate written on his birth certificate. No one is born to be a servant. The very word "servant" contains the injustice of the accidents of life. Isn't it everyone's duty to cultivate fairness? This fairness requires that there be love. Let us not insult the poor. I knew that you'd come, Michéle, that you'd reproach me. But please, don't be too hard on me. So I'm not worthy of eating Marie-Louise's bread? You did it on purpose. You want communion, don't you? That's what you need? No, Michéle, let her alone. Whatever you invent, those dreadful words, It's my duty to love you, and I'll prove it. You're unhappy. How could you raise yourselves? God, how awful. But why shouldn't I say it to you? I know what was in the soup. You spat into it. That's why you didn't want any. I couldn't touch her bread, but you let me take that soup. Let's not stay here. I want you to slap her. Slap her right now. No, Michéle, stop. You've lost your self-control. Can't you see I'm not angry at you? I want you to know that it's partly because of you that I rejected Philippe. He didn't want you. You're too ugly and too poor. I think you're bad only on the surface. All that I've clone for you, the chicken-coop, the field, seemed to me unimportant. I want you, later, when this property which will be mine... - When your father dies? - Yes. I want a large part of it to go to you, so you'll be provided for. Think of how your sister needs protection. And so there'll be justice. I'll be back. Am I alive? What an abyss. Are you deliberately betraying me? Haven't I suffered enough? And now you're destroying me. I heard everything. You spoke too, Marie-Louise, you too. You said that when my father dies... that I'm waiting for that. No, please go back, please. Keep Michéle from continuing. This monstrosity outdoes all the others. And the others were awful enough. She thinks we told, about his dying. I heard it all. You are a serpent in my heart. What a fool. You forget what you're losing for the fun of hurting me. That'll do. It's you who are outrageous. It's you who are a disaster. You're a swine. Talk. Say it, since Madame knows everything. But I don't give a damn. I couldn't care less. Calm down, Elisabeth. - She claims I said things. - Not at all. I heard everything. - What's wrong? - She's raving. She claims I told you she's waiting for her father's death... to inherit. You're penniless... and she gets everything. They beat me, and they don't care. I dare not understand. But we'll sell. We'll sell. - You wretch. - You won't be able to. They laugh at me. That's the essence of my life. Don't touch me. God gave me my sense of justice. Don't touch God's gift. Live elsewhere with my father, but go away. I knew you were narrow-minded, but what's got into you now? I'm dismissing you, definitively. You'll leave at dawn. You're a fool and a wretch. André, your daughter's plotting your death. You gipsies. Not tomorrow. This very evening. Go pack up. They betrayed and beat me. - What's going on? - She's waiting for you to die. Your own daughter. What? My daughter? Elisabeth? To give everything to the maids. All to the maids. Elisabeth. Say it's not so. I'm shocked. Gertrude, who knocked you down? It's frightful. Clear out of here. Get out, get out. You've no right, you owe us our wages. Three years' wages. All right, yes, I do... You tramp. That's all I have, and it's not all mine. Let's count, and then clear out at once. Stop. Stop. As much as you want. You slut. What are you doing? André, you're mad. André, stop. This is awful. What is it? Michéle, what are you doing? Someone's here. No, I won't receive anyone at this hour. There's a gentleman. He says he knocked at all the doors. The others are at the entrance. what is it? Shut the door. I said shut it. You see, I've come anyhow. I hoped you weren't asleep. I brought them along. Do you mind my coming? Elisabeth, what's wrong? You were sent from heaven, from heaven. It's you, it's you. It's heaven's will. You can't imagine. How are you, Philippe? What good wind brings you? How are you? Don't let them sell. It's falling apart. And besides, there are termites. The house is unsaleable. You mustn't rob those people. You're not a thief. - Beware of thieves. - Termites? Why didn't you tell me? You concealed the fact from me. Yes, yes, there are termites. But I didn't know. I learned only this evening after I left you. Why, it's nothing, nothing at all. - What do you think? - It's nothing. - But that powder there? - It's all a lot of nonsense. - Did you ever see termites? - But Gertrude... I'm asking you: did you ever see termites? But that insect... - Where did you find it? - In a matchbox. - Who gave you the box? - The maids found it. The maids... I've had the same thing and still do. - It's merely bran, nothing more. - Nothing serious. It'll hold up 100 years. Who wouldn't have been convinced? I think the maids were sincere. I'm the guilty one, since I believed it. So, no termites. I'll show you everything. Including the cracks. I want the sale to be above board. Look at every detail. Look at everything. See for yourselves. Those girls have clone damage, yes, actual damage. You can't imagine what we've just been through. Open up, Michéle. Are you there? - Where are they? - I don't know. I've an incredible thing to show you. They opened a cask. A million francs lost, the last vintage. And, I don't dare say it, they even beat us. But let's forget it. Be quiet, André. - Don't believe Philippe. - He wants only to get his wife back. - Don't buy. - He's misleading you. It was Monsieur who spoke the truth. Look at the kitchen. The cellar, the roof... And our room. A find road 200 yards away, and yet you knew it. The county office is involved. There was talk of it. Why not wait? The land will go up in value. I never go back on my word. What a tease, what a tease. We're saved, my clear. Be seated, gentlemen. I want to leave with you. Pack your things. I'll send the truck. - We've 2 or 3 weeks. - My aching heart is baggage enough. Tonight, Philippe. - I can hardly believe it. - You can't know. Take me away as if I were a young bride. Save me from this madhouse. You'll cure me. Let's go over to these gentlemen and their papers. What do they want of us? What can we give them? - It's all in order. - It's a good practice. - Since it's provisional... - But provisionally definite. - The notary agrees? - He'll draw up a deed. So there'll be no surprises on either side. - I've taken a breather. - By all means. I have a request to make, but an important one... Does anyone doubt my honour? My friends... May I call you that? I declare the kitchen is in perfect condition... in excellent condition, the walls, ceiling and floor. But it's in such a mess that I'll sign, in agreement with my daughter, only if you don't look around. I'm ashamed. That's understandable. Here's coffee, and it's quite good, strained in muslin, as we did it at home. I taught the maids how to do it, but that's all they've learned. Come along, show what you can do. I'm dating it as of October 27. Agreed? It's now 10:35. We'll assume it's 12:01. We stay at home all year. I'm attached to the soil. We'll need a suburban garden. I'll garden, in the suburbs. - You'll come to see us. - I don't think so. You'll have your whole life before you... Your whole life to love your garden. I'll have only a house-cleaner. I'll never again have servants who live in. I can't offer you our Louise. We can't give her up. - She's irreplaceable - Is she that good? You're flooding everything. Go away, you're in the way. Where are you going? No, I don't want you to. We won't go in. Just a little peek. You shouldn't. The kitchen's in such disorder. We won't stay. Stay here while I sign. Come here first. And I sign. That does it. Gentlemen, all this is yours. Let's drink to it. Do you have something good for us? Where are the servants? Just a peek. Marie-Louise, Michéle. Where are you? We need the Benedictine. Be nice. They're not here. They almost broke it. They looked pretty evil. How old are they? Stay here. I said stay here. I know you're there. It's me, Elisabeth. Now open the door. Don't try to be different. Come to the drawing-room. Elisabeth, let them alone. Michéle, you've clone enough. I've been too nice. I order you to come back. I was planning to do all I could to maintain good relations with you, despite everything. I'd have sent you a testimonial. Answer me. Won't you answer? It's as you like. From now on, don't expect any recommendations from me. You won't be able to get a job. I'll have you enter a convent, where you'll be separated. That'll reform you. - They've locked the door. - I wanted to give you something. Elisabeth, let them alone. We can't tolerate that. Be careful. They've ruined everything. Did you understand me? Will you obey me, or not? We must do something. We must do something for them. Help. Come quickly. No, no, be quiet. I said be quiet. Have the decency to be quiet. You dirty dog. You swine. You skunk. You vile creature, you cheat. You never deserved respect. Your stupidity is the cause of your crimes. Did you hear what he said? You're vile, you're an idiot and you're destructive. You were bound to end like that. You poor wretch. In September 1933, in Le Mans, the Papin sisters were tried and convicted. The elder was sentenced to death and her sister to ten years hard labour. Yet the archives show that the court itself asked: "Who is really guilty here?"
