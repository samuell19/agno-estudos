in a film by FALLEN Help! Did you call me? Yes. Do you know how many people commit suicide every year in this country? 700. And this jump from the bridge was just one of those. This bridge isn't even the favourite. The suspension bridge is much more popular. And do you know what type of suicide is most common? Wrong. At the top is drug overdose, 36%. Various sorts of hanging, 15%. Slashing wrists and poisoning... ...10 to 12%. For them it's the end of their life, but for me, for me it's work. This case, too. It's just one amongst all the murders, rapes, child abuses, mafia deaths... ...one of these cases. Year in, year out. Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter... By the way, do you know how the seasons affect the suicide rate? It's highest in Spring, in November and over Christmas. Man has lost his way. He's lost himself. Something in him is torn apart. There's an open wound in this society. It's bleeding. And I'm surprised at those who haven't done it yet. Not to mention those who are vegetating on the edge... ...who are living like animals, who are murdering, robbing and running amok... ...for one more day of life, their bloody life. Man... What is man? An image of God, a creature who's left his creator... ...and is now going under in this pitiless world... ...which is on the brink of disaster? I don't know, my friend. I've been doing this job for 20 years now. I'm always thinking about it... ...but I can't answer this question. I can't. You can't imagine how tired I am. I've had enough. I'm limp and exhausted. All I want is... I want to know what you actually saw. You said you saw how the woman jumped into the water. Can you describe her? No. I was too faraway. Actually, I didn't see anything at all. Alright, I heard a noise as if someone had jumped into the water. Just after that I heard a woman calling for help. Then I ran over there. Over where? There, from where she called for help. When I got there, there was no one... ...the voice was gone as well. I just saw the water, that's all. You didn't see anything else? Alright, then give me your personal number... ...and all your other numbers. Matiss Zelcs. - Yes. 04.03.71... ...- 107... 43. Hundreds of people go by use very day. We don't take any notice of them. But if one of them dies... ...west art to be interested in them right away. Just like in this case. We don't notice anyone. And that's the saddest thing. But I have to rummage around in all that. Me! Hard work. Unpleasant work. They're coming. Unfortunately, we didn't find anything. Should I drive you home? - No thank you. I'll walk. Matiss, hurry up! I'm closing! I'm coming! Thank you. Hello. - Hello yourself. Where are the files for the skin and sexually transmitted diseases centre? Number33. - 33. How are you? I'm fine. And you? The same. 33... Sign here. See you. Good evening. Good evening. A 50grammevodka. Which vodka? The ordinary one, Moskovskaja. Tell me, did you work here yesterday, as well? Yes. Why do you want to know? Did you see someone yesterday, perhaps... ...a woman with blond hair, with brown-green eyes, in a light coat? Are you from the police? - No. Look, she's my girlfriend... ...and she didn?t come home last night, and I... ...I really don't know where she is now. Yes, she was here. I saw her straight away. She sat in the corner over there and had quite a lot to drink. She wrote some letters and then crumpled them up. She left her handbag here. I haven?t taken anything. There was no money in it. Just a couple of women's things, an envelope... ...and a ticket from a photo shop. What happened to the letters? We threw them away. But they?re still here. You can look for them. Another one, perhaps? - No, thank you. Thank you. Sorry, but we?re closing soon! My dearest Alexei... ...I don't know how to start. Everything is so confused. I took a decision recently which I can't live with. The price of our happiness was too high. It's not your fault. I only have myself to blame. I shouldn't have left my old life... ...just because I love you. But there's no way back. There's no excuse for what I did. Every time I look at you I can't stop feeling guilty. Forgive me for... Dear Alexej... Dear Alexej, I couldn't put up... ...any resistance to you and you knew it. You should never have pushed your way into my life. The stronger one is responsible for the weaker one. The innate reason for his responsibility is his strength. It means he has to look after the weaker one and defend him. Every person we meet is like a gift from heaven for us. What we do to them, we do to ourselves. All the darkness... ...all the pain and disappointments... ...we cause people... ...we give ourselves, but light and happiness, too. We create ourselves every day. We've caused others so much pain and suffering... ...because we wanted our own happiness. But in the end we suffer ourselves. There's no way out for me anymore. Your shadow... Dear Alexej... ...I can't and I don?t want to go on living like this. I tried to make my life good. Like everyone else I wanted to be happy. Like so many others, I didn't know how. Why is it so difficult? I drink to your health, Alexei. I think of the happy moments I had with you. All that remains are memories. Live well. I wish you every success. I love you, but... I love you, but... Alina. Alina. The slides for Alina, please! I've come to get the photos... - Here you are. Thank you. Goodbye. I'm sorry, could you repeat that please? OK. Please. Yes? I'll get it ready. Right away? I'll be there in one minute. Who's there? - Alexei Mesetzkis? Yes. - Good evening. My question may seem a little strange. Do you recognize this handbag? No, not at all. I'm sorry, I found an envelope in this handbag. Here is your name, Alexei Mesetzkis... ...and your address, Mira 5-9. Has something happened? - I don't know. Where did you get it? I found it in the street not far from here. Do you want something for it? - So you do know who it belongs to? Yes, of course. And does she actually live here? - Yes, she lives here. Well, I can give her her bag myself. Give me the bag. I'll give it to her. - When is she coming? In a day or two. Listen, what do you want? Give me the bag. Take the money... ...and disappear. I don?t want your money. What do you want? Who are you? My name is Matiss Zelcs. I'm an ordinary person. I work in an archive. May I? Every day from nine to five. Every day I go home the same way. And suddenly I found this handbag. Usually people lose their purses, keys. But they never lose their handbags. I'm scared to think what could've happened to this handbag's owner. You don't believe me? I didn't take anything. Yes, I opened the bag but there was no money in it. I swear, there was no money in it. There was only an envelope with your name and address. Is she your wife? No. We've been living together... ...for a few months. For three months. But she told you she'd lost her bag? No. She went away two days ago and didn't come back. But what... Listen, just stay out of this! Yes. I'm sorry. Jealousy. Pure jealousy. Good morning. It's Matiss Zelcs. I just wanted to say, I'm not coming to work today. I'm just not feeling very well. Tomorrow or the day after. Thank you. Bye. Bye. Yeah, yeah... ...it?s all my fault. We met when she was still a child. You understand? A child. I never took her seriously. It was a pastime for me, a game. Then I had to go away. I left her behind. We wrote to each other. I wrote less and less. She wrote and said she'd wait for me. It didn't matter how long... ...two years, ten. But I never answered her. It seemed so childish, you know. So childish. The years went by. When I came back, she was married. She had a child and a husband. She had become a woman. When I saw her, I realized I needed her. Do you understand? I needed her. We met and it turned out that she'd loved meth whole time. She decided quickly. She didn?t love her husband, she came to me. He took the child away from her. We started living together. Somehow she changed. She lost her cheerfulness, shut herself up. I had the feeling I was living with someone... ...of whom I didn't know who the hell she was. She didn't belong to me. Understand? The last few days were terrible. We argued, shouted at each other. She blamed me for ruining her whole life. Yes, you ruined her life. You ruined it! - Stop! No! You ruined her life completely. You said you love her. You said yourself that you love her. But you don't love her. No. You said yourself... ...that you're playing with her. You just wanted to possess her, Alexei, but that?s not love. I simply don't understand... ...how you could push into her life, into her soul. I'd never in my life ever have done that. If I had met her... ...- me, who works in the archive... ...I would've loved her. I'd never in my life ever have hurt her. She would've been happy with me. Just shut up! Listen, you're responsible for her. You left her stranded. You threw her away. Drove her away. Where to? You drove her into misery. What sort of a person are you? Poisoning someone else?s life. And what if she?s done something to herself now? It?s all your fault. Yours. That would be awful. Yes, it's all my fault. I don't have anything anymore, you understand? I don't want to live anymore. Stop, stop! I don't want to live anymore. - I said stop! Come on, we can talk about it, find a way out. There is a way out. - What? What do you mean "what"? Come on, let's have a drink and talk about it all. You see, first of all, there's forgiveness. If you regret deeply from your heart, then you will be forgiven. You will be forgiven. Second, life goes on. You?re a man. You?ve got arms and legs, you're healthy. And there are other women. Where are you going? To the toilet. - Then go. Please, forgive me.
