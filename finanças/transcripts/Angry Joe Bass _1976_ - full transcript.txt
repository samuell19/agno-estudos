I can just about quote it in my sleep. - Go ahead. - Well, I guess the first important thing I got out of it is what happened at the boat auction. - All right, folks, we're gathered here today to sell a fine boat. (indistinct) without any liens. There's no mortgages. She's free and clear. She's a fine trawler. She's in good shape, everything about her. She's got a 150-horsepower diesel on her. All the rigging and everything. There's $5,000 worth of equipment on this boat alone. She's been taken well care of. She should bring somewhere between $15,000 and $20,000. And I'd like a nice opening bid. Now, who will give me $5,000 to open up the bidding? A $5,000 bid, anybody? A $5,000 bid. Come on, folks. This is one of the finest boats in the harbor. I'd like a $5,000 bid We'll start her out at 1,000. Anybody of y'all wanna bid 1,000? I thank you, sir. $1,000 I have. A 1,500. Anybody make it 1500? A $1,500. Anybody at all? Come on, now. Let's get her moving. $1,500. $1,500. I got the 1,500. $2,000. A $2,000 bid. Anybody wanna bet $2,000? $2,000 I have. I thank you very much. $2,000. - [George] Who's that guy? - Him? That's Joe Bass. He's an Indian fisherman. - Bass. Oh yes. Yes, he's applying for a loan to rebuild his engine. - $2,500. Aw, come on, now. I know it's expensive these times, but it's a fine boat. Come on, now. $2,500. Anybody at all? Who'll give 25? I thank you very much, sir. $3,000. - This is exciting. - [Auctioneer] $3,000. Come on, now. - And you're enjoying yourself, do you? - Anybody on $3,000? $3,000 I have. $3,000. Now make it 3,500. 3,500 $3,500? 3,500 for this fine boat. Come on, everyone. It's worth way more than that. $3,500. But you gotta... 3,500? All right, if you feel that way, I'm gonna sell it. Sold for $3,000. - Well, Hanson, you stole another one. - You didn't buy that boat, did you, Daddy? - Of course not, dear. - Mister auctioneer, do you think it's right to take away a man's livelihood? His personal possessions are still on board. - It isn't a question of rights. It's just a question that it's a legal auction. The mortgage has to be fulfilled and taken care of. It's gotta be sold, and that's it. There's nothing I can do about it. - Nothing you can do about it. - Mister auctioneer, that's not the way of the Lord. - Well, I don't work for the Lord. All I'm here to do is sell a boat. - [Bill] Morning, George. - Oh, Bill. - Yeah, George? - You know that Bass character? - Well, yeah. He fishes out of here. - Yeah, yeah, well, uh, he's been running around town bragging about all the illegal fishing he's been getting away with, and making you look kinda foolish. - He has, huh? - That's right, yeah. I bet could find him in any number of illegal violations. Just sniff around a bit. You'd be doing me and this town a big favor. Damn commercial fishermen are ruining the sports fishing industry in this area. How many of those high rollers from downstate you think are gonna come up here if they can't catch any lake trout? You don't expect those boys to squat in the dock with cane poles and fish for perch, now can you? - Well, I, uh, I guess not. I'll look into it, George. - Yeah, you do that, Bill. - Morning, George. - Take care. - Here's one. Here's one the DNR will never see again. Nice fat trout. You know, it'd be really wonderful to be able to fish in these things again, legal. - I doubt it. - Yeah? Hey, you coming down to the bar tonight? - Yeah. - You know, we ain't been seeing you down at the bar lately. Well, it's not a bad move. No, one at all. I mean, uh, Jesus. And we're gonna be out here being chased by the DNR. (both laughing) (men chattering) Joe. - All right, hold it. Hold it. What did you toss overboard, Bass? I heard it. - Why don't you go swimming and find out? - We're gonna get you, Indian. You better believe it. Oh, you think you're so damn smart. Well, time's running out on you, 'cause when that new law is passed, you see how good you are when you got to use trap nets like all the other fishermen. They only fishing you'll be doing is to get money to pay your fine. - Anytime you wanna try it. Now, get off my boat! - [Dr. Ryan] Hello, Karen. Mind if we come in? - Hello. - Remember I was telling you about Dr. Kessler? I'd like you to meet him. - Hello, Karen. Can I talk to you a little bit? - [Karen] Maybe you can tell me when I'm gonna get out of here. Dr. Ryan won't. - It won't be long. Why do you think you're still here, Karen? - Because Bill Hemmings murdered my father and I went into shock when I found out it. - Why do you think Bill Hemmings killed your father? - Bill Hemmings' wife. - [Dr. Kessler] You knew about that? - Didn't everybody? - You didn't like your father, did you, Karen? - Look, Dr. Kessler. I'm not in shock anymore. And I know they don't lock you up in a funny farm just because you don't like your father. He wasn't a very likable person. - All right. You were in shock, you're not in shock anymore. You've accepted your father's death. Why do you think you're still here? - You mean these? Well, it just seems to me that when you're locked up in a prison like this and there's nothing really wrong with you, suicide seems like the sane thing to do. What do I have to do to get out of here? - Carry on talking to Dr. Kessler. Tell him about that dream of yours. - Do we have to go through this again? I've already told Dr. Ryan everything. - Yes, I know, but I'd like to hear it from you, Karen. - I first had the dream right after Daddy was killed. (ominous music) (bell chimes) (Karen screams) Joe. When am I gonna see Joe? I keep asking Dr. Ryan, and he keeps telling me to wait. But I wanna see him so much, and if he doesn't wanna see me, I think he should tell me that. - Karen, here's what I'm gonna propose. You tell me the whole story, and I won't stop you from seeing Joe. Fair enough? - OK. - [Dr. Kessler] All right. How did you first meet Joe? - Well, I first saw him at the auction, but it was later that day when I really met Joe. (men chattering) (horse neighing) - Hey, watch where you're riding. - What? - Watch my nets. - Oh, I'm sorry. I, um... They're kind of hard to see, you know, with the sand and everything. - That's OK. - Um, didn't I see this morning at the auction? - Yeah, I was there. - Isn't your name Joe Bass? - It's what they call me. (horse neighs) Aren't you, uh, what's his, uh- - I was there with my father, George Hanson. - Ah, George Hanson, yeah. - My name is Karen. I really liked the way you stood to my father today. - You did, huh? They sold one of my best friends' boats. Hey, you better get going. Your father's flunkies are coming. - Are you, uh, all right? - Hello, Mr. Hemmings. - What are you doing down here with these Indians? - Just out for a ride. - Well, they're very unpredictable. You'd better go home. - Hi, Dad. - Hi, sweetheart. How are you? Have a good ride? - Where's Mom? - She's in her room. - How's she feeling? - She's upset, because, 'cause you haven't been spending enough time with her. (telephone ringing) Just a moment. Hello? Hanson here. Yeah, Bill, what's on your mind? All right. Uh-huh. All right. Thanks, Bill. Karen. What were you doing down at the beach with that Indian? - So he is your flunky after all. - Karen, I don't want you near those Indians again. - I was only riding my horse down by the beach. - Karen, I don't want you near those Indians again. You understand me? - Look, Dad, I'm not a baby anymore. I oughta be able to go where I please. - Karen, I'm not through talking with you. - Dad, I just don't feel like talking right now, OK? - If it weren't for the DNR, I guess you could call it the perfect life. There's not many around lucky enough to say that. A couple of years ago, when the trouble started, we might've had a chance. We got organized, and might've got rid of some of that stupid legislation they were trying to blast through the State Senate. There's no appeal. They not only want the fish for the sports fishermen, they want the whole goddamn peninsula. You might've noticed all those empty houses up and down the peninsula, rotting in the weeds. People used to live in 'em. Didn't happen to have Indian blood. At least they couldn't prove it. Remember the Thompsons? Four generations of fishermen. Great family. Now they're gone. DNR drove 'em out. Wouldn't let 'em fish. They tried it illegally, but kept getting caught. They confiscated their boats. Whole family split up. And you ask me why I'm so bitter? - Karen, let me ask you a question. - What? - [Dr. Kessler] You still love, Joe, don't you? - Yes.

I mean, there was just no way I could tell him how I felt. I tried talking to Joe. I wanted him to talk to my parents. I thought maybe they would accept him. But he wouldn't listen. Maybe you could come over on Sunday. I think it's about time you met my parents. - There's no way I'm gonna get into a family thing with your folks. It just wouldn't work. - Couldn't you just give them a chance? (Joe sighs) - Yeah, it's not a bad idea. I could get all slicked up, put on my best pair of jeans, the ones without the patches, and a clean shirt. Ah, I can see it all now. Sitting in your father's study, sipping brandy, smoking cigars, talking business. - I don't see why you couldn't just do it for me. - The last time I talked to your father, he turned me down for a $200-loan to fix my boat. You know what he said to me? He said, "Joe Bass, apply for a loan with the Bureau of Indian Affairs." - He was just trying to help you. - Help? By taking his advice, I'd be fishing out of a canoe. - I don't see why you couldn't just do it for me. - Look, there are two reasons. One, I'm a fishermen, and two, I'm an Indian. ♪ Wait till the sun shines, Nellie ♪ ♪ And the clouds go ♪ Hey, is that you, honey? - Yes. Hey, hey, come on in and say hello to your parents. - I don't believe it. Everyone home together. We ought to try this more often. - Sit down. Sit down We'll have a, we'll have a nice long talk. Hey. We love you, you know that? - And I love Joe Bass. - No. No. No, that's, that's not possible. You haven't known him long enough. - You two have nothing in common. You're college educated. You're from a good family. He's nothing but a common fisherman. He's middle aged. - Look, look, we're not racist or anything like that. It's just that, well, it's a good idea for different segments of this society not to mingle. It never solves any problems. It just creates them. - I know how I feel. I know I love him. - You're out of your head. - George. - Shut your yap, Sylvia. (George laughs) Hey, hey, you think you know this Bass character? You think you know him? (laughs) Well, he's drunk every night, and he's out with a different bimbo every night. - It's not true. It's just not true. - [George] Don't sell yourself short, Karen. Please. - Karen, don't throw your life away. What man will want you when that Indian's finished with you? - I just don't even wanna listen to either of you anymore. You don't know what you're doing. - Where are you going? - I love him, and that's the way it is. (upbeat music) - [Karen] Have you seen Joe? - No, I haven't seen him anymore. What's happening? - The second I got home, my father started screaming and calling me names, saying, "Stay away from those Indians," making me feel ashamed. I don't even think I wanna go home anymore. - You can stay at my house tonight if you want. - Thanks. - Joe is a nice guy. Give your parents time. - Patty, you don't know my father. He was acting like a madman. I was so pissed off with Mom and Dad, I think I would've just kept going out with Joe to spite 'em. But anyway, I wasn't prepared for what was coming. (engine revving) Oh my God! Joe. Joe? Oh my God. Joe. Come on, Joe. Wake up, wake up. Joe! Joe. Joe. Joe, Joe, it's me. Joe, come on. Joe, come on. Joe, listen. Come on, Joe. Come on. Please hurry! (knocking at door) - Child, what happened? - [Karen] I don't know. - My son, my son, in big trouble again. (indistinct) - Where's Daddy? Daddy. Daddy, Joe Bass got beat up tonight. - Really? How did it happen? (telephone ringing) - I found him on the side of the road. I don't know. I took him home. - Took him home? Is he hurt bad? - I don't know. It was dark, but there was blood all over the place. - George, it's for you. It's a Dan somebody or other. - Uh, I'll take it in the other room. - [Karen] That beating Joe took was just the first of a whole series of hassles he went through, and I didn't realize until much later who was behind it. - Put this man into custody. We'll go down with you. Go through the book. So book him. - [Karen] It was almost funny in a way. He keeps getting arrested, and I go around raising money anywhere I could, any way I could, even from total strangers. Then, when I got enough money together to pay his fine, and believe me, those fines were always stiff, I'd give it to Father Ranguette, Joe's priest, and he'd go along and get Joe out of jail. - What's the matter? - Patty called. My mother's been calling all over town, looking for me. - Well, why didn't she call here? - My mother would never do that. - Why not? - She just wouldn't do it. - Hmm. What you want? - I've got to go. - You just got here. - I know. It looks like there's a lot of trouble at home. - OK. I hope it's not too bad. - I'd like to come back later. - If you do, I'll be at the bar. Bye-bye. - Be nice now. I haven't been with you or your father for a long time. That isn't asking too much, is it? (car horn honking) Oh, look who's coming. - Hi, Mrs. Hanson. - Well, Jim, how are you? Haven't seen you all summer. - What happened last year, Jim? Flunk a couple of courses? - No, I went to summer school to try and get some extra credits. How about a movie tonight? - Sorry, I've got plans. - Doing what? - Cleaning the stalls. (people yelling) - [Bartender] Hey, hey, hey! Get that horse outta here! - Oh, Christ, not them again. (laughs) - Kevin, I told you there'd be trouble if you rode that horse in here again. My insurance don't cover it. - Screw you! Who's coming home with me tonight? - Get outta here! - Screw you! Who's coming home with me tonight? (indistinct) (people cheering) (indistinct) - How'd it go? - Bad. - These Indians. 10 years ago, they will have cut your throat (indistinct). Now they're carrying (indistinct). - Well, you can come and stay with me. - You mean that? - Sure I mean it. I still got a boat. Got my nets. Fish out there in the lake. I can take you car of you. - Oh, Joe. I love you. - Joe Bass! What are you doing, Indian, at my place at the bar, huh? (glass shattering) (people shouting) - [Bartender] Wait a minute! Hey, whoa there, guys. - [Man] Get him! Get him, Bass! (people yelling) (indistinct) - Get 'em both outta here. (glass shattering) Pull 'em out. Get 'em. Hey, fellas, cut it out! - Let's go! - I'm gonna quit the business. - Cold in here. - When the winter hits this cracker box, you'll really know what cold is. - Hey. What about your father. - He's a sound sleeper. - To the champ. Hey, you know what? We gotta take care of that eye. Where's the first aid kit? - Just dip it in some whiskey. - I hope I made the right decision by staying here tonight. I have a funny feeling I'm gonna be disowned. - You'll be all right. Had enough excitement for the day? - Not quite. (dog barking) (glass shattering) (glass shattering) (gunshot banging) (Karen screaming) - [Karen] What's happening? - Guess I must've made some enemies. (gunshot banging) (Karen screams) Karen? - [Man] Hey, Joe Bass! Come on out, or we're gonna make a shit pile of your cabin. Come on out now. - You OK? - Yeah, I'm OK. Just a little flesh wound. (gunshots banging) - [Man] Hey, Bass! Come over to the window! - Karen, hold this. - We've got something to show you. - Where are you going? - [Man] We ain't gonna shoot. White man's honor. (explosion booming) - Please, don't make me go through this anymore. I can't. I won't. - All right, Karen. That's enough for now. - What are you looking so worried about? - I don't get a clear picture of Hemmings in this trial transcript. What are your impressions about him? - You want the short version or the long one? - Well, give me the short version. - A simple, weak, ineffectual character. Obvious tendency for violence. Worked for the DNR. - Well, if that's the short version, you'd better give me the long one. - Hey, Jerry, come on out here! Come on. Hustle it up. Lemme have your tape measure. - Yeah. Wait a minute. - Come on. Well, let's take a look. Too small. Too small. Too damn small. What you got up there? My, oh my. You boys trying to rape the lake? Too small. Too damn small. Too small, too small, too small. Too small. Too small. It's too small. Too small. Well, tell you what. I'm not gonna write you up this time. - Yeah, I see why. You wouldn't be able to eat the evidence. - Very smart, very smart. Jerry. - Yeah, OK. - Thanks, boys. These are gonna be mighty tasty. Jerry. Listen, you gotta get it together, man. It's the only thing they understand. - I don't know, Bill. I don't think this is my kinda work. I didn't know I was gonna be a policeman. I thought I was gonna work in the fish hatchery when I signed it. I studied fish production in college, not police administration. - Yeah, well, you ain't in college anymore, kid, are ya? - No, but you know. The way you treated those people back there, it's incredible. - It's a job, Jerry. It's a job. DNR, Department of Natural Resources. They pay your check every Friday. Stick around here a few years and you'll know what I'm talking about. - Yeah, but look, these guys are my friends, you know? - Yeah, well, a couple of them were my friends once, too, until they dumped on me, and then I get all that flack from Washington. Hey listen. Tell you what. I got some business in here. - Yeah? - You take the truck, drop off those fish at Hansen's, and I'll, uh, I'll see you in a while. - OK, Bill. - Hi, Sally. - Hi there. - How you doing? - Just fine. How are you? - How about getting me a cone. Chocolate chip? - OK. - You know what I think? I think you're the best dipper they got in here. - Really? - Yeah, I mean, this is the real thing, not like that Dairy Whip. Whatever that stuff is they sell across the river. - Gee, you know, I tried to get a job over there, but they just wouldn't hire me. They have a funny lever there, you know, and here, my wrist gets all bent out of shape. - Yeah. You been working all day? - Yeah, but I get through in about 15 minutes. - Yeah? I gotta go out and check the beaver dams. - Gee, I've never seen a beaver before. - You're kidding. The woods is full of them little buggers. I have to spend one day a week just blowing up their dams. If I didn't, the whole county'd be flooded out. - But don't they get hurt like that when you blow up their dams? - Hurt? Jesus, yes, they get hurt. I set off one charge. Blew a dozen of them little things 100 feet up in the air. - You didn't really. That's mean. - Well, no, I was just kidding. You didn't believe me, did you? - Well, I don't know. Just, I couldn't believe you could do something like that. - No, I mean, I go out there and I climb out on the dam and I fire off my revolver a couple of times. Give 'em a little advanced warning, you know? I mean, I don't like doing that, either. Somebody's got to do it, though. I mean, you don't want the whole county flooded out, do ya? - Gee. I'd really like to see those beavers. - You would? Well, would you like to come out with me this afternoon? It'd be a good time. - Well, do you think we could get back in an hour? - It's cutting it kinda close. - Well, how about tomorrow? I don't have to work until five tomorrow. - Tomorrow? Oh, well, yeah. Uh, well, yeah, yeah. Um, listen, I gotta go. But tomorrow for sure. I'll pick you up. I gotta run. - Bye. Hey, you didn't pay for the cone! - Oh, Bill. - Janet. George. - Hi. - Where are you folks off to? - Bill, you're just the man I wanted to see. Have you taken care of that little item we discussed? - Why, yes, I have, George. And I had some fresh fish sent over to your house. - Good, good. Nothing I like better than fresh fish. Well, if there's nothing else here, your wife and I have to check on some collateral. - On a loan. - Right. - Uh-huh. Well, I'll see her for dinner, huh? - Oh yeah. It should just take a few hours, right, George? - Right. - Yeah. OK, see you later, honey. (upbeat music) - So here we are. Now, I want you to sit right here. I'll be right back. - Is this where the beavers are? - Shh! Now, come on. If you yell and scream and move around like that, they're never gonna show up. Shh! - What's this? - Well, sometimes it gets very cold, and very long hours out here, and I keep this to stay warm. Have a little. - (coughs) Oh, that's strong stuff. - First one always tastes like that. Have a little more - What's that over there? - That? - Yeah. - Well that's, uh, (clears throat) that's a cage where they breed beavers. - Oh. - Listen, if we sit out here like this, they're never gonna come around. They're gonna see us. We gotta go up and hide in them bushes. - Oh, I don't know about that. - Ah, come on. Come on, come on. Right over here. Now, you sit right here. Well. It's a lot better, isn't it? I guess so? - What are you doing? You're old enough to be my father. Hey, what's this? What's this? - What? That's my gun. - I've never handled one of those before. Show it to me. - Ah. Hey, hey, hey! Be careful with that. That's loaded. You gotta have a license to use these things, you know. - Don't be such a chicken. I've handled rifles before. - Yeah, well, they're not the same. This is a revolver, and it's different. It's dangerous. - Can you show me how to use it? - Nah. - Oh, come on. Show me how to use it. - OK. OK. OK, OK, site down, just like a rifle. Hold your breath. Now squeeze. (gunshot banging) - Oh! (gunshot banging) Oh! (Bill laughs) - No. No. No! No, no, no! No! (girl screaming) No, no! Oh, no! No, no! (screams) Ow! Ow! Ow! No, no! - Jesus Christ! - What the hell is going on? - I can't get rid of you! Come on. Let's get outta here. - Please take me back to town. - Sure. - No, you're going with me. - No, I'm not. - Shit! - [Dr. Ryan] You've probably gathered that there was not much love lost between Hemmings and Joe. And it's not difficult for an officer of the Department of Natural Resources to maintain that fishing nets are of an illegal size. But he didn't reckon on Joe as being a fighter, an Indian who wasn't going to take any bull from a bully. - Joe, Joe, Joe, Joe! Joe! Hey, Joe! - [Dr. Ryan] And I'm certain he didn't know that Joe was physically the stronger. It's quite possible that if he hadn't been restrained by his friends, Joe would now be facing a murder charge, a murder committed on that very beach. - You just made one big mistake, Bass, and you and your friends are gonna regret it. - Hemmings! You forgot something. (engine revving) - A guy like Hemmings would always feel animosity and anxiety around a personality like Bass. He'd always feel that Bass was getting the upper hand on him. But there's still a lot I don't understand. - Well, let me fill you in a little more. - All right. - Let's back up to the point where Karen was talking to her father on the porch. - Karen, I'm not through talking with you. - Dad, I just don't feel like talking right now, OK? - George, George, what happened? - I'll tell you what's happened. Your daughter's running around with Indians. - What? My daughter's what? - Keep your voice down, for Christ's sake. - I'll talk just as loud as I want to. Don't walk out when talking to you! I'll even shout if I want to! Why do you always walk out when I'm talking to you? Oh, I suppose you're gonna shoot me now. - That might be a very good idea. (gunshot banging) Pull! (gunshot banging) Pull! (gunshot banging) Pull! (gunshot banging) Pull! (gunshot banging) Pull! (gunshot banging) Pull! (gunshot banging) Dan! - Hey, Mr. Hanson, that's some fine shooting. - Thanks, Dan. - What seems to be troubling you, Mr. Hanson? - You know that Indian, Joe Bass, who was bidding against me at the auction? - I've seen him around. I hear he's been, uh, well, I hear he's running around with white girls. - That's not right. Mr. Hanson, is it? - No. No, it's not, Dan. Maybe there's something you could do about it. I'd be willing to make it worth your while. - OK, Mr. Hansen. OK. (ominous music) (suspenseful music) - [Joe] Ow! - [Man] Let him have it! - Now, we know that Hanson set up that beating of Joe Bass, and the attack on the cabin, and that he didn't know that his daughter was in there with Joe at the time. And that attack, the attack on the cabin, was the turning point for Joe, 'cause that's when he started fighting back. - Joe, where are you going? Come back! - Dammit, what are you doing here? (ominous music) (objects clattering) Dammit, girl. I thought I told you to get outta here! Dammit, girl! I told you to get outta here. Don't need any more of this stuff. (chainsaw buzzing) (chainsaw buzzing) (chainsaw revving) - You crazy, boy, sneaking up on a man in the woods like that? You crazy, boy? You'd get yourself in trouble out here in these woods. The only way you'll get rid of me is in two pieces. (chainsaw revving) (man screaming) - George. I got here as fast as I could. What's up? - What have you been up to, Bill? - I don't understand. - What have you done about Bass? - I've been watching him. I got my eye him. - Oh, yeah. Well, I can tell you what Bass has been up to. He's on his boat right now with my daughter. He smashed in Dan's face. Kratowski got his leg chopped off. He says Bass did it and he's gonna press charges. That's what Bass has been up to. - You're joking. - No, I'm not joking, Bill. - Well, who saw him? - What the hell difference does that make? - All right, George. - Oh, Bill. You better start thinking pretty hard about your job. - Doing the best that I can. - Do it better. - [Dr. Ryan] Karen's father was really quite a character. After sending off his flunky, he then drops in on his girlfriend, the flunky's wife. - Janet, what's wrong. Every time we get together, the evening starts out well, and then you get positively morose. - Happiness is, it's just too much trouble, George. I'd better learn to enjoy my misery. You wanna tell me again how you're gonna divorce your wife and marry me? - Hey. You know I love you. Hey, I love you. Look, I've got to wait until Karen is out of college. - Ugh. Sweet little Karen. She just wouldn't understand. (scoffs) George, she's not 15 anymore. I really have heard a lot of things about her. - You're not telling me anything I don't already know. - George. - Janet, I need your help. - No, no, it's on the house. You had a rough time. - Thanks, Bernie. (telephone ringing) Yeah? It's for you. - Hello? Who's this? What kinda trouble? You did? Who's this? Hello? Hello? - Now, we assume that that phone call came from Janet Hemmings, Hanson's mistress. But here's something I don't understand. It never came out at the trial. So we're supposed to believe that Hanson set up a meeting with Joe Bass and his own mistress and have his daughter walk in on them. That doesn't make any sense. I mean, Joe was no fool. He wouldn't have fallen for a trap like that. - If you remember, in the transcript, the bartender said Joe had two drinks and sobered up fast when he got the phone call, so we can assume he wasn't drunk. But let's speculate. Let's say Joe goes bursting into the fish house, and who should be waiting there for him? Let me guess. Don't tell me. Janet Hemmings, having been sent there by Karen's father, OK? - [Dr. Ryan] Mm-hmm. So far, so good. - [Dr. Kessler] Well, she comes on real strong with him. She just loves Indians, and she can't help herself. Stuff like that. She figures that if she can make it with the biggest banker in town, she shouldn't have any trouble with a red-blooded Indian, if you'll excuse the expression. - [Dr. Ryan] Well, from you? Certainly. - [Dr. Kessler] She proceeds on the traditional courtship ceremony consisting of getting down to basics, taking his clothes off as quickly as possible, and then doing the same with her own. So now we have the two of them alone in the fish house, surrounded by dead fish, the moon bright outside, the stars twinkling. - [Dr. Ryan] You mean in their eyes? - [Dr. Kessler] Well, there too. You can even have music playing in the background if it helps. - [Dr. Ryan] No, I don't think Joe is much of a music lover. What happens next? - [Dr. Kessler] Well, they're two young people. Normal desires, normal passions, nothing to lose. Can you buy that? I don't know. I'm not so sure I'm on the right track. I don't know. - No, I can't buy that. It's out of character for Joe. - No, that's inconsistent. - I guess we'll never know what really happened, except for the last part. Later that night, Hemmings somehow or other turned up at the same place. Now, who tipped him off and how he got there we'll never really know, nor does it concern us. We just know that he'd found Janet alone. - [Dr. Kessler] Well, apart from the dead fish. - [Dr. Ryan] Oh yeah. I'd almost forgotten them. And in a state of undress that could easily have her in bed with the most acute attack of influenza, if a quirk of fate... Is that what it's called? - [Dr. Kessler] A quirk of fate. I think so. - [Dr. Ryan] If a quirk of fate hadn't shifted the course of events. - Give me the gun! (gunshot banging) Huh? Janet? No. Janet. Don't die. Don't die. Oh, I love you so much. I do. I love you. I'm sorry. I didn't mean it. (suspenseful music) (car horn honking) - [Sylvia] I cannot go to the door in my nightgown. - All right, all right, all right, I'll get it. (gunshot banging) - [Sylvia] George? George, are you okay? - Have you notices the irony of this? - No. - That Hemmings would probably have never gone on trial if he hadn't confessed. Murder number one, number number two, no witnesses. - But there was another murder, and there was a witness to that murder. Only, she doesn't remember. Karen, that dream you had again last night. Very important. Was it the same as before? - Yes. - Now, let's see if we can work this out together to the end once and for all, what do you say? - [Karen] If it'll get me out of here. - Very good. Let's talk about your relationship with Joe, your feelings towards him. The last time, you remember him being arrested. - It was really beginning to look hopeless by then. I was beginning to realize how futile it all was. He'd go to put his arms around me and I could feel myself recoiling from him. There was this gulf widening between us, and we were fighting about the stupidest little things. Oh, this is stupid, Joe. Can't you get one of your friends to pull the nets? - They've already packed my boat with ice. Besides, they got their own nets to take care of. - Don't you need help? - You volunteering? - No, I'm not. You shouldn't be going out on your boat. It's stupid. - Look, Karen, this is my life. Don't you understand? - No. I've got to go out there and pull my nets. You coming along? - Please don't go, Joe. It's not worth it. I thought you were smarter than this. - You going to come along or are you going away? What are you gonna do? Shit! Here comes your old man. - (indistinct) That son of a bitch! Karen! What the hell do you think you're doing, staying out all night with this guy, and now making a spectacle of yourself in front of the whole town? It's disgusting. Hey, Indian, you get that boat back in here. - Ignore him, Joe. I'm not going with him. - Listen, Indian, you get that boat back in here. This little girl is coming home with me. You get that boat back in here! - I'm going with you, Joe. - You're not gone with her! You get that boat back in here or I'll have up on a kidnapping charge! You hear me? OK, OK. You're not gonna get away with this, you know? You can't go around stealing a white man's daughter. - All right, fisher boat. Fisherman, stop! I'm warning you. Do you hear me? Pull that boat over here. - What are you gonna do, Joe? - I oughta sink that son of a bitch. - I'm warning you for the last time, man. - I guess I gotta consider it a threat. We'll be in port! I'll talk to your agents out there! - (indistinct) I'm not gonna tell you again, heave through. I'm telling you, and I'm not gonna tell you again. Heave through. - He knows who you are. - [Bill] I'm warning you, Bass. (gunshot banging) - Joe, stop this boat! Joe, I think you'd better stop. He looks serious. Joe! (gunshot banging) - Hold it, Bass. Your boat was sighted outside the limits, Section 13, set by the Department of Natural Resources, under the act passed July 2nd, 1975. Section 14, Paragraph 5 reads as follows. No commercial- - Ah, come on, you guys. I was within the boundaries. I have a code book on my boat. Huh? - Well, use of your vessel is being terminated as of now, 1400 hours. In addition to which, you are being booked for assault and battery, disturbing the peace, and assaulting a government officer. Oh, and there was one other thing. Cutting off Kratowski's leg. - I did all of that? - Impossible. He's been with me the whole time. - Karen, for your own good, please stay out of this. Jerry, cuff him. - You gonna come peacefully, Bass, or you gonna cause a lot of trouble for everybody? - Mr. Hemmings. - Come on. Come on. - Taking him out. Take him out. - [Joe] Don't forget to get the fish iced down. And call Father Ranguette. He'll take care of everything. - Once again, it was Father Ranguette to the rescue. I don't know what Joe and I would've done without him. Oh! You're finally home! - Wow. Come on. Is my boat OK? - Yeah. I went down and checked on the boat every day. And I got Father Ranguette to take care of the fish, just like you asked. - Good. I missed you. - I missed you a lot. - Ah, it's good to be home. - You know, Joe, was lonely, too. - [Joe] You were? - The next night I was supposed to meet Joe at his place, but I was in for a big surprise. Hi, Bernie. - Hi. - Have you seen Joe? - He was here earlier, but I don't know where he went. Have you tried his house? - Yeah, but he wasn't there. - I don't know where he went. - OK, well, thanks anyway. - [Bernie] OK. (slap thwacks) (Joe groans) (Karen yells) - Karen, stop. You're not being fair! (indistinct) - Oh! - You little... - Mm-hmm. - I may have exaggerated it a little bit, but it sure seemed like they were ready to make it. Anyway, the next day things were different. - [Joe] I remember seeing that slicker? - [Karen] I don't think it was at the house. - Yeah, here it is. (Karen giggles) How do you feel? I feel beautiful. I never felt more secure about anything. - It's easy to say things at night in bed. But the next day, the morning, sometimes it's difficult. - I really know, when I think about trying to get along with you. I don't care what happened. It doesn't matter, considering everything we have in front of us. - I'm sorry I have done anything to hurt you. It's tough pulling a living out of the lake. Sometimes I forget what you need. - I love you, and I'm proud of who you are and what you are. I know it possesses you. I don't care. - We'll be OK together, huh? - Mm-hmm. - And what happened next? I don't know, he went down to the, he went to fix his nets. - Karen, go on. - Please, I don't want to. - What did you see? (suspenseful music) Karen, this is not a dream. It's real. (gun cocking) - I can't. I don't wanna see. - What happened, Karen? - [Karen] I heard a click. (gun cocking) - [Dr. Kessler] Then what happened? (gun cocking) - Bass! (gunshot banging) (Karen screaming) - He's dead. He's dead. - Karen, you won't have that dream anymore. You're a very brave girl.
