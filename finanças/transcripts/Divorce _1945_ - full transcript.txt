I'd as soon live with my wife as face Conlon again. I told you. It's as easy as taking candy from a baby alligator. I hope we're not late. I'm dying to see this Carter woman. The papers said 11 o'clock. - Get the doors closed, please. And who were these guests before whom your husband insulted you? Friends. I was entertaining at bridge. They are here now. And just how did he insult you? He said I ought to be upstairs with my son Jimmy who was ill. It sounds as if his part might be well taken. Should you have been with Jimmy? My son was attended by a reputable physician. And capable nurses. I see. And on this other occasion when he locked you in your room .. What reason did he give? He's very hot-tempered. And the most unreasonable .. Just answer the question, Mrs Elliot. Well, I had punished Jimmy. By confining him to his room to practice his music. What did your husband say? He said. See how you like being locked up. Do you often punish Jimmy in this way? Only when it's necessary. You see, I excused him from his music lesson as he complained of a headache. And then he sneaked in an alley to play baseball with very undesirable boys. Boys of the lower class? Your Honor. You are placing my client in an unfavorable light. Counsel. This is not a jury trial. Let me add that Mrs Eliot is admirably represented. Likewise, Mr Eliot. But I represent Jimmy. And every child who appears before me in this court. You may take exception if you choose. Mrs Eliot. Jimmy is not very strong, is he? Well that's why I didn't want him mixing with strange boys. He so easily catches things. I wonder if Jimmy could catch a baseball? Mrs Eliot, did your son's music teacher .. Ever tell you he couldn't be a musician because of a defective ear for music? Yes, but I discharged her. My son is perfectly normal. Did she tell you the lad suffered acutely when trying to play the violin? And that if you persist in trying to develop a talent which doesn't exist .. You are being guilty of extreme cruelty? Oh, but I simply thought he was affecting it. Give him time. You were driven by the same motive which actuates all your behaviour. Mrs Eliot, you are a show-off. I grant every divorce with reluctance. But I never have and I never will where children are concerned. And the disgraceful failure of parents. Until every last effort has been made to bring about a reconciliation. I'm not granting you a divorce, Mrs Eliot. Get together with your husband. Make a career of your son. And I suggest you eliminate the music lessons. Jimmy. Come here. Tell me how old you are, Jimmy. Seven and a half. Did you understand everything we were talking about just now? I know one thing. I don't have to play the violin anymore. That's about all there was to it too, Jimmy. I think when you get home your Dad will get you a baseball and a catcher's mitt. That's swell. Fine, Come back and see me again some time, will you. Okay. I will. Carter. John B. versus Carter, Dianne. Raise your hand. You swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth? I do. - Be seated, please. Will you proceed, Mr Plummer. Will you state your name, age and occupation please. John Carter. 54. Broker. Your reason for wishing to divorce Mrs Carter is because .. Mr Plummer, why don't you let your client tell the story in his own words? Your Honor. My wife and I have been married for a year. In fact, today is our wedding anniversary. We've been drifting apart for months. I guess I'm not the man to make her happy. According to this complaint you're suing your wife on the grounds of cruelty. That is correct, Your Honor. When love flies out of a woman's heart. Perhaps it isn't hate that flies in. But it certainly isn't the dove of peace. My client means Your Honor, that .. His wife reacted such that life under the same roof as her became intolerable. Your client's figure of speech, Mr Plummer is .. While somewhat hackneyed, sufficiently intelligible. Mr Carter, in exactly what way did your wife react? She treated me in a cruel and inhuman manner. Subjected me to humiliation in public. Mr Carter, are you still in love with your wife? Yes, I am. Your Honor. That my client is still in love with his wife does not alter the fact that .. She has made it impossible for him to live with her. Possibly. I've done my best, but .. Mrs Carter wants her freedom. So, being a gentleman, you're giving it to her? On January 1st. Or to be correct, on January 15th. She slapped my face. And in February. It was the first week. She threw a glass at me. I do wish people on this stand would stop glibly reciting like parrots. Mr Carter. Cruel and inhuman treatment .. Does constitute sufficient grounds for divorce in this state. Providing there is a corroborating witness. I see you have one waiting to testify. Delusion however is illegal. And carries a severe penalty. Your Honor. I must insist that the records show that I take exception to this unusual .. And I must say .. Gratuitous reflection upon my client. And upon my own professional conduct. Sit down, Mr Plummer. I've grown weary of seeing homes broken up. Especially when chivalrous men like Mr Carter are involved. I've read this property settlement. It is excessively generous. In view of the wife's well-known career in other divorce courts. Any woman who has been married so many times. Can hardly come into a divorce court with clean hands. So she prevails on her husband to seek it. Contrary to the usual custom. Your Honor, again I insist. Mr Plummer. Offhand, I'd say that everything about this proceeding savours of collusion. I'd like to ask Mrs Carter a few questions. Is she in this courtroom? She left the city last evening. I see. Conveniently out of this court's jurisdiction. Probably forcing me to grant a decree by default. I think Your Honor, that we've complied with all the regulations of the statute. What a mockery. It's a shame to see this courtroom packed day after day .. With men and women intent and determined to destroy their marriages and lives. There isn't one marital breech aired in this court that couldn't be reconciled. Obstinate husbands and selfish wives. Too proud to make even the slightest concession to each other but .. Not too proud to drag their sordid marital difficulties into the limelight. Yet I can do nothing. No court can. Love and trust and self-denial is succeeded by .. Selfishness and bitterness. Mr Carter. June 5th. Was once the most beautiful day in your life. Today .. one year later. It has become a hideous anniversary. You will probably get your divorce when the formalities are complied with. [ Door knocks ] Yes? Telegram, Mrs Carter. - Thank you. Will you close that please. In the bag is right. I never would have suspected you being a girl from Hillsboro Mrs Carter. I haven't been here for a long time. I bet you won't find the home town changed very much. Leastwise folks and things around the old depot. I wonder if they'll think I've changed. Much. I suspect that you have, Mrs Carter. It's what usually happens to ladies who go out to explore the big, wide jungle. Jungle? You know, I had never thought of it that way. Yeah. Especially when they are good exploresses. Like you appears to be. Maybe sort-of, Mrs Carter. Only I didn't bring him back alive. You mean you left that old gentleman there? Just like you found him? Oh. A few of them I guess I've sort-of wounded. Others said they'd die without me. They never did. They finally realized I was just playing the rules as they put them down. Jungle rules. If you know what I mean. Yes, ma'am. We are almost there, Mrs Carter. - I've got everything. Dear oh dear, there you are again. How often have I told you not to bring your toys down here? We wanted to help you get ready for the party. We are good manpower. I'll "manpower" you if you don't stop bothering Ellen. Is everything alright? - Ah, just fine my dear. Good. Can't be much of a party if there ain't no children. If there aren't any children. Nope. This is a party for grown-ups. Old people? Well, older people and younger people. If children aren't young people what are they? There you have me. What time do you cut the cake, Mummy? Ten o'clock, dear. Why do you wait so late? Well. That's the hour your daddy and I were married. Ten years ago. The cake wasn't there, was it? Well, not the same cake. You know, this is a very interesting conversation but it's your bedtime. Come along. - Let's go. Pick your toys up. Every one. Older people act awful childish some times. Boy, you ain't kidding. Are we going to have a Court Martial tonight? No. I think that's on the calendar for later in the week. I'll let you know. We sure want to come to your party. I bet you do. Well, you go to bed instead, huh. Okay. A grand boy. Goodnight. Martha. - Yes, dear? Where are my neck-ties? Where they always are. - No they're not. I looked there. I'll come up and help you, darling. Look, my ties have always been on the rack behind the closet door. Hmm? That must have been in some other house. Here, they've always been in your top bureau drawer. Uhuh, - Remember? Say, whose idea was this party anyway? Well, it's our 10th wedding anniversary. And a big occasion. Or isn't it? - Sure it is, but .. Gee, I'd rather take you dancing or something. Would you, darling? Ah, but the gang haven't laid eyes on you since you've been out of the Army. And tonight is the night. Okay, you win. Bob. Would you do me one other favor? Let's have a Court Martial. Aren't we overdoing that routine? I just got home. I'd like to forget the Army. Oh, but the boys enjoy it so much. It's good for them. Please, Bob. Okay, let's go. Get your uniform on. - Hmm. Attention. The Court will come to order. The United States Provost Court is now in session. Captain BigBob presiding officer. The clerk will cite the offenders and read the complaints. Proceed, clerk. Well Captain BigBob, I have to report that .. Sergeant LittleBob refused to brush his teeth this morning. And when Ellen tried to hold him and do it for him. He struggled. Why, that's absolutely unbelievable. Insubordination of the most flagrant character. Almost as bad as desertion. But I am not through. Proceed. While this was going on, Corporal Michael kicked Ellen. But I didn't kick her very hard. Silence. In all my experience with offenders I've never heard such reprehensible charges. Sergeant LittleBob, you know what the penalty is. Reduction in rank to Corporal. However, you may salute and make your excuses for such behaving. Oh. I just forgot. And your Corporal Michael? What have you got to say for yourself? I was barefooted and I didn't hurt her. It hurt me. You forgot. And you kicked softly. Why, I've never heard such excuses. Suppose for instance that .. Napoleon. Forgot to brush his teeth or kicked his nurse before his great battle of .. Gettysburg. I beg your pardon, Captain Bob. Napoleon didn't fight at the battle of Gettysburg. It was General Lee. I was just testing you. You were 100 percent right. In the future, you see that your conduct is on a par with your mental status. Have I got a mental status? Attention. In view of the circumstances. The charges will be overlooked this once. Court dismissed. Is that all? - That's al. And you, you rascal. You're going right to bed. Now you get to bed. I'd like to make a deal with you, daddy. - Shoot. I can be extra good tomorrow if you send me an extra big piece of cake. I tell you I'll think it over. The more cake you bring me. The less discipline I need. I heard that. It all depends on how fast you get to sleep. Goodnight, sweeties. Be good fellahs now. Corporal. How do you like our top-ranking officer? He's tops. I'll say he is. Hello. Are you having a good time? Wonderful, Martha. Everything is great. Hungry, darling? - Nah, thirsty. Oh. Everyone is so glad to see you, dear. A good party. - You like it? Hmm. Ready to go. Tell me, haven't we met before somewhere? Oh, you say that to all your wives. That's what you think. Hey, take it easy. Now I know we've met before. Darling, I was only kidding. Hey, you can't do that after ten years. They'll be doing that on their 50th Anniversary. And I suppose I'll still be waiting for my first. Oh, Liz. Jim, you know marriage is a great institution. Do you think I'm set for an institution? Well, if you don't hurry, we'll both be ready for the rocking chair. Now laugh that off, Jim. Come on, Bob. Dance with me. The only way I can get into a man's arms. I don't believe that. How is he doing? Oh he is .. he's still restless. He takes an awful lot of humoring, Jim. But he'll get adjusted. - Sure. Would you like a dance with me? - That's a wonderful idea. Well, the Endicotts themselves. Late as usual. How are you, Joan? Hello, Andy. - My fault. Hello Andy. Hiya, Bill. - You remember Dianne? Dianne Carter? I should say so. I wouldn't have known you. Is that good? You will find Mrs Phillips inside somewhere. Fine. We'll look for her. Well. So this is Bob Phillips' home? Isn't it attractive. - Father decorated it. Really? Must be very clever. We don't want to eat. Let's have some punch, Dianne. Punch? Come on, follow the green line. - I haven't had punch in years. We'll taste in anyway. - It's poison. Here, let me fix you a good drink. - Okay. Hello, Doc. Say, do you have to have a prescription to get a drink around here? Hardly. Ah, you know Mrs Carter? Remember Dianne? How could I forget. Dianne is staying with us. I'm still a doctor. In case you should want me to look you over. And, what are you doing now? Gentlemen, thank you. To the pretty girl who used to live around the corner. To the exciting woman who just came in. I am too, too flattered. Oh, there is Bob and Martha now. Oh Liz, you've had him long enough. That's what she says. Oh, hold me the way Bob does. Oh, Liz. - That's better. Billy hasn't changed much. You should know. - Joan. He always did have more oomph than any two men in town except my Bill. Who me? You know, his wife is pretty too. I'll say. You should see her two youngsters I ushered into the world. Now, don't tell me .. Martha moved into town a year or so after you left, Dianne. Really? You know, I think everyone is having a good time. I'm in charge. Are you? Hello Bob. Oh, it's the Endicotts. Hello Joan. How are you Bill? Hello Martha. This is Mrs Carter. She lived here years ago. Oh really? - Mrs Phillips. And this is Mr Phillips. - How do you do? Well, I don't think he recognised you, Dianne. Do you think I should do something about it? Well, I most certainly do. Darling. Come on, take of Mrs Carter. Certainly. - I'd like that. Thank you very much. Anything we can do to help? No, darling. Just enjoy yourselves. Righto. - Joan, honey. Excuse me, doctor. Are you tired, Ellen? - Ah no, I'm fine. We won't run out will we? - No fear of that my dear. Good. You know, you dance very well for a blind man. I beg your pardon? I just thought it's a shame you've lost your eyesight after all these years. I'm sorry. I must be a little stupid. There was a time that I wouldn't have had any lipstick left. If I had been in your arms this long. Bobbalee. Dianne. Ooh. It seems he recognised her. How? What's that? Nothing, Ellen. I .. It's almost time for the cake. I'll take over. You didn't tell me you were here. When did you get back? This afternoon. Staying with the Endicotts. That gives me a score to settle with Joan and Bill. "Bobbalee". You even remembered your pet name for me. There are a lot of things I remember about you. Martha, the magic hour. One minute of ten. Oh, we should be cutting the cake. - That's right. Where's Bob? Dancing with Dianne. - Oh. I think I'll have her up for kidnapping. - Shall I get him? No, no. I mustn't interfere with a passing whim. Is that what you advise? Well, the Dianne I remember was not a passing whim. She drops anchor. Should I be frightened, Jim? - Not you, gorgeous. Ah, here is the cake. Put it right down here, Ellen. It is pretty, isn't it. - Beautiful. Come on everybody. Come and get it. Remember, I get the first piece. You know why. It is a lovely cake, isn't it. Gosh Dianne, what has happened to you? Look what you've grown in to. Look at you and look at me. How did you do it? Well for one thing, you stayed here. I got away. Why did you come back? I don't know. Maybe I wanted to see what the old town looked like after all these years. Maybe I wanted to see you again. But Bob, what's all this I hear about two babies? You haven't done so badly. Hey, they're not babies. They're like this. Yeah, chips off the old block. Want to see a picture? Yes, sure. - I always carry it. They are cute. Obviously you are very happy. What do you think? How about you, Dianne? Oh, I guess I'm as happy as I deserve to be. I don't know. I think you deserve a better break than that. I hear you've been unlucky in a few marriages. To think I should take Martha. Why, she's the best. You see, everybody in town is just crazy about her. Yes. I guess you got the better breaks. Yeah. I guess so. Liz. - Huh? What do you know about Dianne Carter? Don't tell me Tabloid Annie is back in town? Tab ..? Oh Liz, that's an awful thing to say. Well at one time or another she gave every male in this town a fever of 110. Every male? Perhaps only from 9 to 90. Why, we were only in the 7th grade when she vamped my best beau from me. Liz, I thought that .. well, I thought Jim was your only beau. Oh, that's only since the 11th grade. Where is the siren? With Bob. You mean alone? Come on. Liz, don't be silly. - Don't you be silly. Come on. We'll just interrupt them sort-of gently like. Have you got a gun or an ax? And then do you remember the time that .. Oh. Well, here you are. Why, we were just going looking for you. Well if it isn't Dianne. Hello, Elizabeth. Is it really you? Yes. It really is. I didn't even recognise her. You see, Dianne is one of the old school-days gang. Imagine your surprise. Bob has been telling me about your two wonderful children. Oh. Well in that case I'll forgive him for not helping me cut the cake. I completely forgot. I'm terribly sorry. I've got my hunk to sleep on. Oh, Liz. Don't tell me you still expect to get a husband that way. Silly, isn't it. - Yes. But it's the only way I know. I've done a little bragging about you too, honey. Have you, darling? - Uhuh. Dianne is only in town for a week or so. You two ought to get better acquainted. I'm sure we must. Oh Dianne, are you still married to that scandalously rich Mister .. Oh, I saw his name somewhere in the newspapers .. Carter. Still the busy little bee, aren't you. No. We were recently divorced, as of yesterday. No? - Yes. - You don't say? I'm terribly sorry. I think I will get over it eventually, Mrs Phillips. Or may I call you Martha? - Please do. Thank you. It's a waltz. Bob used to waltz very well. Shall we? Go ahead, darling. See how much you remember. Come along, Bobbalee. There you are. Remember. You're going to sleep on it. I've got so much rouge on tonight I look lie an Indian brave. You're not going to scalp me for it are you? Uhuh. Say, what do you think of my old girl? She's awful beautiful. I suppose I should be jealous. But I'm not. Nah. The girl was never born that you should be jealous of. Liz certainly had her tomahawk out tonight though, didn't she. What do you mean? For instance, that crack she made about Dianne's unfortunate marriages. Oh. It seems to me she's been unfortunate .. Oh, a dozen times or so, hasn't she? Three, to be exact. Now Bob, if you're going to be mathematical, it's four to be exact. Liz told me. Look. It doesn't make a difference to me honey if she's had a thousand husbands. But Liz didn't have to sink her ax in up to the hilt. They're old friends. Oh Bob, no. You are mistaken. Liz has never liked Dianne. Well I liked her. I gathered that. Are you still in love with her? Are you out of your mind? Well, why are you defending her? - I'm not defending anybody. Bob, you are. Really you are. You little monkeys. We wanted to know how the party was. Well, how did it sound? - Pretty good. Daddy. Did you bring Bobby and me the cake you promised? Ah, the cake? - The cake. Oh yes. The cake. Oh boy! No you don't. Not until tomorrow morning. Oh, please. Daddy never forgets anything. Do you, Bobbalee? Do you, Bobbalee? Bobbalee? A little bird, honey. Miss Farnsworth, will you put this back in the file please. Mrs Carter would like to see you, Mr Philips. Who? - Mrs Carter. Dianne. Dianne? How are you? Hello, Bob. A nice office you've got. - Thanks. Awful nice of you to drop in and say hello again before leaving our town. I just dropped in to say that I'm not leaving. I'm going to settle down in "our" town. Say, that's great. But how come? Well, I was going to Florida or maybe even to South America. But you know transportation these days. So I've decided to stay. That is if you can find me an attractive apartment. Don't worry about that. Miss Farnsworth, will you give me those listings please. When would you like to start looking? Why couldn't we start now? Well of course. I usually go home to lunch, but .. - Then you go right ahead. I will .. I will meet you here later. - No, Please. I wouldn't want to upset your routine. Oh nonsense. Come on. Wait a minute. As a matter of fact maybe I better had phone. Hello darling? Listen, I won't be home for lunch. I'm just on my way out to look for an apartment for Dianne. Yeah I know, but .. I'll explain everything later. What do you think of this? Could be quite nice. It's a little expensive. And you have got to sign a year's lease. Oh, that's alright. Incidentally, you're going to have to help me buy a car too. A car? - Hmm. Say, you must have struck gold. Yep. Yes, I guess I've had just about everything that life could give a woman. Except one thing. What's that? Love? Hmm. Funny, isn't it. An endless search for something that .. Just never happened. Uhuh. I guess I'm pretty lucky at that. I haven't got much gold but .. I have had a lot of fun. You should have the gold too, Bob. I could help you get it. - How? Why don't you and I form a mutual advisory committee? Hey, that's not a bad idea. Shake. Okay. Sit down. Let me talk about it. You see. What I've tried to do is .. Oh, goodness me! Listen. Forget about that guy, Humpty Dumpty. Yes. But what a grand view he had from the top of that wall. Hello darling. Sorry I am late, honey. That's alright. You have a busy day? I sure did. Among other things I closed on another warehouse deal. Oh, good. - Say, are the kids in bed? Yes. It's after 8 o'clock. You know, you'll have a cold supper. - I don't mind. Did you find Dianne Carter an apartment? - Yeah, in The Stratford. Oh, that's kind of expensive, isn't it? [ Telephone ] You go in to the dining room, honey. It's probably Liz. Okay. Hello? Oh, hello there. Look. I want to ask you a big favor. Will you help me furnish my new apartment? Well .. I'm not an interior decorator. I know you're not but I need you. You see, I don't know my way around here anymore. All the shops and everything. I told Bob at luncheon today. Well, I .. I'll be glad to help. That's wonderful. I'll be thanking you for life. I'll call you in the morning, darling. Well, goodbye. That was Dianne. She wants me to help her furnish her apartment. Yes, swell. Funny, she didn't say anything to me about it. Oh yes she did. At lunch. Remember? You know, you could make Mrs Mahoney's garage look like the Taj Mahal. Where did you take her to lunch? I didn't. She took me. You know, I made about 300 dollars on that lease. Hmm. And one mustn't sneeze at 300 dollars. Not these days. Want some coffee, dear? - Hmm. Please. Everything alright? - Everything is very nice. How are you doing, Bill? You know me, Di. Well, better late than never. - How are you? What in the world happened to you two? I said, we'd never make it. That would have been a pity. This is Martha's house-warming as well as mine. Well, Michael has been running a fever. I'm afraid he's coming down with mumps. Is that bad? Aren't children always supposed to get them sooner or later? So I've heard. I'll never forget the time I had them. You made faces at me through the picket fence. What a brat I must have been. Martha, you know where the bedroom is. Drop your coat there. Hello, Martha. - Hello Jim. Bob, I see you've been elected president of the Realty Board. Congratulations. Thanks, Jim. You see, genius being recognised at last. How goes the Landon syndicate, Bob? Are you in it, Jim? Oh, only five thousand. - I'm in for two. Don't I get in on it? For goodness sake, why talk business at a time like this? Come along. I want to show Bob the rest of the apartment. See you boys later. Hello. Well, look at the hat. Spring is here. A swell job you did on the apartment. - Thank you, Joan. You ought to go into business professionally. Do you realize that you are the biggest man in town? It sort of looks that way. You know how I got there, don't you. - Nonsense. If you never had it in you, you couldn't have done it. All I know for sure is I never did it before. It took a good, solid boost from somebody just like you. Well, I guess our mutual advisory committee is doing alright, isn't it. And how. Gilding the lily, huh? What this? Poison ivy I hope. Oh, Liz. See you later. The Landon syndicate, eh? I don't get why the bank should turn me down .. On a measly $20,000 last month on the Alaska development. But they go for this Bob Phillips set up. Is his credit better than mine? - No, but his sponsor's is. Oh? Who is his sponsor? Don't tell me you don't know? Just look over my shoulder and you'll see her talking to our fair-haired boy. Bob. How much did you pay for the Landon property? Why are you suddenly so interested in business for? It's usually Greek to you. Why didn't you tell me that Dianne was behind this syndicate? Because well .. Well, there is also a lot eastern capital behind it. That spells "Dianne" too. Do you think there is a price tag on Bob? Oh, Martha. I'm leaving. You can stay if you want to. She is paying for the party. - Now just a second, Martha. What for? Why don't you stop acting like a child? Cut out this nonsense. I'm not acting like a child, Bob. You are. You can't just walk out on the party. What do you want people to think? What do you want people to think? Goodnight. She is .. She's a little excited. Come on, Bob. Let's have a drink. I could use one. Then the little girl went home. And was a good girl for ever after. Was it good, sweetie? It hurts my throat. - Ah, poor baby. Mummy, where is Bobby? He's outside playing, dear. He can't come in until you are over the mumps. A surprise for you, Michael. Looks like Santa Claus has come ahead of time. It's awful heavy. - Isn't this exciting? The messenger said it was for Master Michael Phillips. Now I wonder who that could be. That's me. Michael, look. - Oh boy. Ow. "Martha dear, I must talk to you." "Meanwhile, perhaps this toy will get Michael over his mumps a bit happier." "Dianne." Ellen, put it down in the basement. But mummy. She said it was for me. You are right, darling, It is. You can play with it in the morning. You've been up too long already. Anybody home? The door was open so I breezed right in. How are you, Mike? I'm fine aunt Liz. - Good. Oh. A nice electric train. Did your daddy send that? Aunt Dianne. Aunt Dianne? Just call me cousin after this. Ellen, will you put Michael to bed. I'll come back sweetheart and tuck you in. Come on, Liz. Can I take the train to bed with me? Oh, it might run over you. Come on. I think Dianne hit a new high in sheer unmitigated gall sending that train. All I could find was some wooden ones. And after what happened last night, too. Bob hasn't even spoken to me since then. He hasn't even telephoned from the office. Oh well, don't worry dear. He'll get over his mad. Martha, I've simply got to tell you my good news. Brace yourself, darling. The longest footrace in history is over. I caught the scoundrel at last. Jim finally asked me to marry him. Oh, Liz. Oh Liz, that's wonderful. Oh, Jim is so swell. You've waited a long time haven't you. Ah, the brute. But I'll make him pay for it. Yes, by loving him all the more. - I suppose so. Aren't I the sap? You're getting a husband and I'm losing one. I just don't know what to do about it, Liz. Well, you could scratch her eyes out. - Yes. I could scratch both their eyes out. What good would it do? I could even pretend I didn't know. How about trying to make Bob jealous? Jealous? After ten years of marriage, I'd only make myself ridiculous. Well, what are you going to do? I don't know. She wants to see me. But I don't know. I don't know. Hello Martha. - Hello, Dianne. Take off your coat. Toss it anywhere. I haven't very much time. Michael isn't so well today. Oh, I'm sorry. I think he'll survive. - I'm sure he will. Have a drink? - No thank you. Sit down at least. Well. What was it you wanted to see me about? Just this, Martha. I think it is about time that you and I put our cards on the table. Do you have the idea that I'm trying to take Bob from you and your children? Are you? I don't know why Bob didn't tell you I was putting money in the syndicate. I did it because I thought it was a good investment. And that's the truth. The whole truth and nothing but the truth. If you persist in feeling that way .. All I can do is take every penny out and call the whole deal off. What makes you think I want you to do that? The way you acted the other evening. The way you're acting now. Now look, Martha. I think your marriage is ideal. Rather than upset the sweet tranquillity of your home I'll .. I'll go away. That sounds very noble, Dianne. But if you want my honest opinion. I think you're only saying these things because you are afraid. Afraid? Yes. Afraid that the time isn't right to force Bob to a decision. To a choice between us. Alright. You leave me no alternative. I'll bow out tomorrow and tell Bob his project can go to blazes. I'm not asking you to do that. Bob's waited a long time for his chance. Then for heaven's sake what am I supposed to do? I don't know. You see, I'm very new at this sort of thing. Look. Let's get this straight. You think I want Bob. Certainly I want Bob. To put over the Landon deal. I've got the money to do it with. Do you want me to throw him back into the petty small-town business .. He's fiddled with for years? Or do you want him to go someplace, be somebody? I want him to be someone. Then don't you realise that Bob has outgrown Hillsboro? The war took him places. Let him do big things. Now if I can give him a break to pull out and amount to something .. Don't tell me you'll stand in the way just because of your stupid jealousy? No. Good. Then let's call it quits. You know what I want. And I know what you don't want. Come on, let's forget the whole thing. Have a drink. I'd better get back to Michael. Goodnight, Dianne. Goodnight, darling. See you soon. Gee, this is a swell cake, Dianne. Don't overdo it sonny. Don't forget you just got out of a sickbed. How about you, Bobby? Nix. I want to ride my new bike. I do too. Alright, but it's late so don't go very far and stay off the highways. Be careful. - We will. Okay. I guess I forgot to thank you, aunt Dianne. For the bike. Yeah. And my tricycle and the cake too. Well that's what you get for being such good boys during Michael's mumps. They are kind of nice kids. I guess I'm pretty lucky. So are they, Bob. Having you. You know. Life is a very funny thing. A year ago I'd have given a million dollars if I had it, to be as I am now. At home with Martha and the family. Well. Here I am, and somehow it's all different. How do you mean? You. You know I'm crazy about you. I guess that goes both ways. And what are we going to do about it? What do you want to do about it? Gee, there ain't enough room in here. I'm going out on to the road. Just a little way. Come on, let's go. No, you wait here. You're too little. Then I'll be back and maybe if it's okay, Dad will let you go too. Remember, stay there. Hey Bobby, wait for me! Michael! Michael! Is he alright? Mummy. Ellen, I'm home. - I saw you coming. Where are my fellahs? Oh, bills. Michael. Michael, what happened? - It was just a little accident. Are you alright, dear? - Sure, Mummy. It was my fault. I disobeyed Daddy. We had the most wonderful picnic. Only the bicycle aunt Dianne give me is all busted. Oh, Not "give" me. "Gave" me, precious. And don't you worry. I'll buy you another one. Sorry you couldn't have been with us, Martha. Ellen. Take Michael upstairs will you and put him to bed. Yes, ma'am. Hey. I got a candy bar hid. You want some? Gee, it pays to be sick. Just when was this gay little picnic planned? My little brainstorm, dear. I thought it was a good idea to sort-of celebrate Michael's recovery. I do hope you're not annoyed, Martha. I'm more than annoyed. I'm sorry. - Now, Martha. Stop making a mountain out of a molehill. I'd better be going. Just a minute, Dianne. Yes? Don't ever take my children out again. I said, I took them out. Stop sending them presents, correcting their grammar and calling them precious. Well. This is new angle, isn't it. No it isn't. You are not interested in my children. You are interested in Bob. - Now, Martha. And don't put me in the position of a jealous, petty wife. I must say the role suits you perfectly. Just what do you two think you're getting away with? Let's get down to facts and face the truth. Bob, are you in love with Dianne? Okay. You asked for it. I am. - I see. Then of course, you want to marry her? That's right. I do. Well Dianne, it's your party from now on. Haven't I anything to say in this little family confusion? Not a thing. You fought for this for a long time. I haven't fought for anything. If you keep on being as stupid and nagging as you are .. You can't blame Bob for wanting to walk out on you. After all, he was in love with me years ago. Why shouldn't he be in love with me now? Of course. Why shouldn't he? Alright. I'll give Bob a divorce. I .. I suppose you'll want to name me? Not unless Bob tries to take my children away from me. If he does, I'll drag you both into a real scandal. Well. I guess everything is pretty clear now. I'm leaving, Bob. I'm leaving with you. And so I've got you all here to try and talk some sense into Martha. About the divorce. What can we say? She seems to have made up her mind. Well, it's all your fault, Joan. Why did you have to ask Dianne here for a visit anyway? Now wait a minute, Liz. After all, Joan and Dianne have been friends for years. She's entertained us each time we've gone east. And I don't think .. And besides, I didn't ask her. She asked herself. Maybe I felt sorry for her. Another divorce. Well, I thought maybe a trip here would do her good. Meeting old friends. - We're not getting anywhere. We're trying to stop Bob and Martha from getting a divorce. Oh, I don't say I'm not sorry about the whole thing. Well, it's a little late for that. Martha seems determined. And we've all got to stand by her until Bob comes to his senses. But after all, Martha has asked me to appear as her attorney. Look, what a spot I'm in. - Martha is in the spot. I've talked to her. She doesn't know whether to send the children away .. Sell the house, go to work or what. I think Dianne will take care of those arrangements. That's right. Why don't we concentrate on Dianne. Show her the tragedy of this whole divorce. I'm sure she will be a good sport. Why don't you legal minds advise Martha to sue for alienation of affections? No, no. That would drag the kids into it. It would be an awful mess. This town could make it so hot for Dianne that she'd .. Well, don't forget Dianne knows her world. Now. If the divorce is asked for in this town it will come up before me. Bill will be Martha's attorney. And with a willing defendant, the divorce will be granted. Naturally, she will get the children. Hello everybody. - Oh. Hello, Martha. We've been having a little conference down here. Oh, you are all very sweet. I do appreciate what you're trying to do, Jim. We're only trying to help. Too late. - That's where you're wrong. Why don't you have a talk with Bob? It will be like taking to a stranger. You know, when Bob went into the service. I didn't think I could bear it until he came home. When he did. I was so happy. Well, I just didn't realize how much he'd changed. And that was before he saw Dianne again. Martha. Marriage is entered into with such high hopes. Such promises of happiness. And then too often, divorce. And in its wake. Disillusionment, despair, heartache. It doesn't make sense. - Oh Jim, what do you want me to do? Do you want me to compete with Dianne Carter? Why she's got everything he wants today. Money, glamor. Why, it's a whole new world to him. It's just something I don't know anything about. I had a husband. I lost him. There is no use crying about it. I just want to call the whole thing off. You want me to draw up the complaint, honey? Alright. I'll call you tomorrow. Martha. I wish you'd change your mind. Fifteen minutes recess. Mrs Phillips and Mr Philips, will you come with me please. This is off the record. Sit down, Martha. Well, here we are. Just friends. Now, can't you two get together and patch this thing up? Have you asked these two boys of yours what they think about this business? Or don't they mean anything to you anymore? Oh, Jim. Their future is secure. - Secure? You mean financially? Not the security of your daily guidance. Your comradeship. Just the security of money. Well, if you've transferred your devotions .. From your sons to your banker they are well rid of you. Let's get on with the hearing. Mrs Phillips, I notice in this complaint .. You do not ask for the support of yourself and your children. No. Your husband is perfectly able to provide. Is he not? Yes, but I will manage. You may step down, Mrs Philips. - Thank you. It is the decision of this court .. That an interlocutory divorce be granted to the complainant. The defendant should pay to her the sum of $150 a month. The custody of the children shall be granted to the mother. And the father shall have right of visitation .. On the last Saturday of each month. Court adjourned. Well .. that's that. Don't worry, darling. I'm sorry, Martha. Don't sorry, Joan. Everything is fine. That nearly hit me. Come on, go out on the street. Get out and stay out. I'm telling you those boys they clutter up this house. Ellen, you're wasting your time. You will just have to do it all again. - Why? This is their day with their father. Yoo-hoo! Hello, Liz. Here we are. - Hello, dear. Hello, aunt Liz. - Hi. Daddy is coming. Boy is that something. We're going to have a special lunch. Ice-cream and everything. How about a couple of plays mummy before daddy gets here? No, honey. I don't want to keep aunt Liz waiting. Oh, just a couple of plays. You be center. I'm full back. Michael, you're a quarterback. Aunt Liz. You are on the other team. You can be an end. And end of what? Oh you .. just stand here. Okay, down mummy. Oh, if I get a run. Okay. Get ready, aunt Liz. This is the end run. I run? No, Michael is coming round your end. I hope he makes it. Ready, Michael? Hey. Ah. 11 .. 4 .. 14. 38. You're pretty good, mummy. But I guess we'd better wait for daddy. Bobby, I'm much obliged. No! Michael. Play for interference. Liz, did he hurt you? - No, it's alright dear. It's alright, dear. - I'm sorry. Think nothing of it. Want to play piggyback? Why not? Probably what I was designed for. No, siree. You get down here young man. Now I want both of you to calm down before your daddy gets here. Go on up and get washed. Hurry up. And stay out of the icebox. Little monkeys. Come on, Liz. Martha, why don't you stay home? You've got to face him sometime. Let's stick around and see how he acts with his children. After what he's done. No. He wouldn't be at ease with the boys in front of us. I can go black-face. I wanted him to enjoy the day too. I put a damper on his first visit. - I'd love to put a damper on him. Or a flat-iron. Liz. She'll probably wait in the car. I could blow it up. That's one thing she wouldn't do. Come too close to this house. - Hmm. That's what you think. How am I doing? Okay for a small-town boy. I could learn a few pointers from you myself. No. I'll let you be the teacher. Play thirteen. That's my lucky number. What a lot of good times we've missed, haven't we. Yeah. From now it's going to be okay, huh? As long as you stick around and show me the ropes. Here she is. I'm sticking, Bob. For good. You shouldn't have slammed that door. - That's alright, Liz. They can't .. Ellen. Ellen! I must have been napping. - What has happened? Daddy didn't come. He didn't even telephone. Oh, darling. Well .. He was probably just detained at the office. But you shouldn't stay up so late. Well, I said they could stay up for a wee while. Why Ellen, why didn't you call Mr Phillips? He's deserted us. Well, Bobby. Desertion is a hard word. Let's just call it dereliction of duty. Now you'd better get to bed. Go on. Daddy will probably come and see you tomorrow. Goodnight. Goodnight, mummy. What is "dereliction of duty"? Another way of saying desertion. I did phone the office. Mr Phillips wasn't there. Then I took the liberty of calling Mrs Carter. She and Mr Phillips have gone to Chicago. Uhoh. Well Ellen, you must be very tired. Go on to bed. Will I make some coffee? - No thank you. You've had a very trying day haven't you. Oh, it's alright dear. I'm just sorry for the .. Well, Liz. You've been a honey to stick by me all day. You had better go on home. You have a date with Jim. - I broke it. I'm going to stay right here. I've prepared Jim. He went to his club. Or did he? Oh Martha, what is it? I can't take his place. I can't even play their little games with them. I should have fought for it. Don't, you precious dear. Don't call me precious, Liz. Martha, don't darling. Good morning, Mr Phillips. Good morning, Miss Farnsworth. I'll call you as soon as I've looked through the mail. Oh. Oh Mr Phillips. It's been so long. Thanks, Ellen. Let me talk to Mrs Phillips, please. I can't do that, Mr Phillips. She's not here. She's not there? Why? Where is she this time of day? She is working. Working? Where? In Greens Department Store. Oh, I see. Alright, let me talk to Bobby then. I can't do that either. He sells papers after school. Uhuh. Alright. Thanks very much Ellen. Just forget that I called. Thank you very much. May I help you? - Have you any decent stockings? Excuse me. May. Will you help her. Oh, Liz. - How are you, Martha? My feet hurt. I don't wonder. You shouldn't be working. It's necessary. - Why don't you accept Bob's check? No, Liz. I'd rather work. It keeps me from thinking. Hello Marie. Mrs Carter? - I'll tell her you're here, sir. Hi, sweet. - Hello. How'd it go today? Alright. Busy. A lot of work piled up while I was gone. A lot of publicity too. Do you think this makes us celebrities? Well, I wouldn't think we've added much to our respectability. Would you? Don't tell me you're blushing my great big puritan. Would you rather be respectable or successful? Is there any law against being both? For heaven's sake lighten up. Bob, What's the matter with you anyway? I .. Saw Martha today. Really? How come? Not to talk to. She's working behind a counter in Greens. She .. Sent my check back. So. The little woman is going noble on us. Well, she's worked before. Probably do her good. Keep her occupied. A bit rough on her, aren't you? I don't think so. Just honest. Look, Martha is alright. She's a great girl. Why are we fussing about Martha? I know all her good points. There are so many more important things for us to talk about. Such as? Well, for one thing. Dunn & Marshall have accepted your project for $700,000. That's just a neat one hundred percent profit. I don't follow you. How did they know about it? - I told them when I was in Chicago. They sent a man out to survey the development and found it was tops. Why didn't I know about that? They've handled a lot of my investments. I just thought it was a good idea to make a double check. Now just a minute. Who's running this deal? I'm not just a promoter you know. I laid out those plans myself. And I'm a guy that likes to dig into a job, watch it, and then finish it. But who cares who finishes the job? - I care. Oh, Bob, We can't stick around here in Hillsboro. We have the whole country to play around in, and after the war, the whole world. Wait for the green light, dear. You might have a million dollars, you might have fifty million. But when we go high-dee-ho it will be on my money. Money that I've earned. As you say, Bob. You know, I guess that is one of the million reasons I'm in love with you. You are so idiotically independent. Mostly idiotic, I should think. Well. I'm going back to the office. - Bob. You are going to have dinner here. - No. Not tonight. What started this row anyway? No row. I just wanted to finish off that work. That's all. Then by all means go and finish it. See you tomorrow. Not unless you are more agreeable. Goodnight. Well gentlemen, Dunn & Marshall are offering $700,000 I think with the prospectus I've drawn up, I can force their ante to a million. Well, if it's that good, why sell? Because they've got the organization to merchandise the project. I haven't. But aren't you going to supervise the job? Uhuh. The whole setup has changed, boys. I'm blowing out. So, first we're big-shots and then we're not. I can't help it. They are stronger than we are. Let them handle it. I guess Bob is right. I know I'm right. How did it go? Or did the board kick up its heels? They didn't like it too much at first but I talked them into seeing it my way. Or I should say your way. I didn't want you to give the whole thing up unless you really wanted to. I'll not go into all that. You've got what you wanted. We're selling out. Dunn & Marshall get here Monday. Then in about a week we'll straighten the whole business out and off we go. But it's no use kidding ourselves. We wouldn't win any popularity contest in Hillsboro. So what is the first stop, skipper? Wherever you want to go. - I don't care. You don't sound too enthusiastic. I'm sorry, honey. I didn't mean it that way. Well, I got to be off to see the kids. - 0h, darling. I forgot to tell you but .. I hope you won't be angry. Marshall is arriving this afternoon. You see, I talked to him long distance and .. He said that it might be a good idea to get here a little bit earlier so .. Well, I expect him for lunch at any moment. Yeah. But you know this was my Saturday with the kids. I forgot. Honestly. Then it's your headache, not mine. You've handled the deal well so far. You can handle Marshall yourself. You don't need my help. - But Bob. I didn't see them last month, and I'm sure going to see the kids this month. Bob. Bob, wait a moment. Of course I want you to see Michael and Bobby. It's just that .. Well, I guess I'm a little bit selfish, that's all. I want to be number one in your life. It's never been like this before. I've always been on the top side of the fence. Kind of funny playing second fiddle. You see I .. I love you, Bob. I love you more than I ever thought I'd love anybody in my whole life. There now. You go along and have a good time, huh? Thanks, honey. I'll be back in a couple of hours. Just a quick hello. Then right back to you. Alright. I'll expect you at two. Right. Goodbye, now. Goodbye. The Court Martial is now in order. Attention, Captain. Ellen, read the charge. Well, Sergeant LittleBob. Your father. I mean Captain Big Bob. Has made your mother cry. Sure. I know he's made mummy cry. But there is nothing in the manual about a woman crying. We can't court martial him just for that. We've got to have something else. Well, I don't think much of your old Manual of Arms. If there is nothing in it about a woman crying .. After her husband has left her. What about "dereliction"? I was coming to that. Captain Bob deserted mummy. And us too. It means the same. Desertion in the face of duty. Desertion is about the worse crime of all, daddy. I mean .. Captain Bob. You told us that yourself. Me and Corporal Michael I guess .. Will have to punish you. Have you got anything to say for yourself, daddy? Sir, I .. Plead guilty to the charge. But you must have had some reason, daddy. You couldn't just desert us for nothing. You had to have some reason. Well. Sir, on thinking it over I've decided that .. The reason I had for deserting in the face of duty. Wasn't a very good one. In fact .. I think it was a pretty poor one. Sir, I am sorry. It is the judgement of this Court Martial. That you be reduced in rank. To a private. And that you leave this house. And never come back. That is. Not unless mummy will forgive you. We will now take off his Captain's bars. Don't cry, son. Don't forget I came up through the ranks once before. I'll get those bars back somehow. I thought I told you .. - Relax, Martha. I'm leaving train on the first train. Tell Bob I don't know anything about children's games. Well, Mrs Carter. We have got you for a passenger again. You didn't stay long in your old home town, did you. I stayed a little too long. That's too bad. Did you find that folks and things had changed very much? I thought they had. But I discovered that they hadn't. You seem to have changed quite a bit since I saw you last. Yes. I have. And I don't think I'm going to like it very much. # Tg ~ #
