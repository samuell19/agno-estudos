On the morning of March 9, 1916, Pancho Villa's troop attacked the town of Columbus, New Mexico. America retaliates immediately. President Woodrow Wilson invades Mexico with more than 5,000 soldiers led by General Pershing. The military parties penetrate up to 600 kilometers into the state of Chihuahua looking for the leader. The "Punitive Expedition" begins. Military part of the police headquarters of Guerrero City, Chihuahua, April 1916, to Venustiano Carranza: "...I have the honor of letting you know that, according to all the reports I have gathered, which I deem fully true, at this moment, Villa is everywhere and nowhere. Third colonel of General Gaudencio Miranda F. [horse neighing from a distance] General! They took Ramiro Rezendes alive. The gringos are here. Tons of them. Lots of patrols. What's new, Chicogrande? What? It's chock full of gringos, General. [trumpet playing] [soldier 1] He's Mexican, even if he's a Villista. Why give him to the gringos? Why? [soldier 2] This is about getting Villa. If not like this, then how? Tell me, how? [soldier 1] Well, yes, but damn it. Look at us. [lashes] Where is Villa? [lashes] Towhi. [lashes] [lashes] Where? Where? [lashes] [lashes] Where is Villa? [Villa grunts] [Villa grunts] [whistling] Easy. Villa in the mountains. A fox eating rabbits. Better get back to Columbus. Major Fenton. From now on be honorable. Be a true soldier. [trumpet playing. Last warning. That kid. Guanzaras. Yes, General. He's soft. Take care of him. General... He... ...he's like my son. He's soft. Look at him. He's hoping for people to heal. If we don't get better... Don't take any risks. We've got to get out of this cave. They'll make many people pay. Very poor people. And many of them. Look at it like that. I'll do it, General. [knocks on door] Eat, Aparicio. Come on, Darling. Eat. Just for talking? Lady says that's worth nothing. I'll tell you how and where to go. How many men Villa has. Where he is and when to go. I'll tell you what time and where the kids are alone when the lady goes out. What was that at the end? My English isn't very good. [man] There you go throwing tantrums again. You get stupider every day. Must be because you're getting old. Shh! Look at that. Could it be? What else could it be? Good morning, sir. Only you and me, sir. And I choose the place. Absolutely. Where do these redskins come from? My name is Ciro Rezendes. They call me Viejorrezedes. As far as intel... I know nothing. I have no news. It's Viejorrezendes. Viejorrezendes. What I think is true, or I must be very wrong. Which is not the case. Where is General Pancho Villa? How is he? What's he up to? I ask nothing in return, sir. When General Villa is in good health... there's always news coming in because he never stops. But there's no news. So? So he's injured. In the Towhi mountains, nowhere else. But only he knows where exactly. Your people are getting ready. No. They better not. They'll never find him. Not even those who stayed with him know the exact location. No more than three. Two should be arriving here soon. Waiting. Everyone's waiting. No army can go into those mountains. Two of the good ones. The best. Great people that neither you nor anyone will ever meet until they come out. Unless you make them come out. Brave people. That's my business, sir. They need a doctor in Towhi. So, yeah? No, too much garbage out there. Chock full of Carrancistas and gringos. More gringos. So? Nothing. They're just there. We share knowledge from the same textbooks. But we practice it differently. Isn't that right, colleague? ANTI RE-ELECTION MOVES FORWARD We have good judgment. Here we only get people who can't find in their homes the way to heal their wounds with herbs. No. Such as those from physical torment. Cold torture and other methods. Ever heard of that? Exactly. You're right about that. But I won't discuss about that with you. Again, does anything hurt? No? Then I'm sorry, but I can't show you out. We don't need shit from you. [bell tolling] [whistles] [thunder] Fuck, man. So much damn walking around. So much walking around. Guanzaras. Yeah? Guanzaras... If the gringo catches you... I'll die fighting. No. He'll die fighting. But he's not catching me. He's too stupid. No, Guanzaras. He's not stupid. No, man. So what about all this coming and going? I don't know. But if they get you, you won't die fighting. -[thunder] -You'll die tied to a post. Eyeless. Tongueless. Toothless. No molars, no nails. No balls. They'll cut your ears off. Motionless. Beyond dead. Unable to fight. And he's not stupid, don't ever think that. What's the matter, Chicogrande? What's the matter with you? I'll die fighting. I'll die fighting. Not two or three... I'll take 20 gringos. I'll take 20 gringos. I'll die fighting. I'll die fighting. Not two or three. Twenty gringos! [thunder] What's the matter, Chicogrande? What's the matter with you? Enfrijoladas, pellizcadas, tomatadas, enchiladas, machucadas! [trumpet playing] Enrolladas, embijadas, empulcadas without pulque! Where are these gringos going? -They're bringing Villa. -Really? No way. Oh, Lord, if they do, we won't have anyone to look after decent people. We'll be at the mercy of the criminals. God save us. Calm down, ma'am. Don't believe that. They'll be back soon. [trumpet playing] [bell rings] [indistinct angry chatter] Ya'gotou, ya'gotou. Mexican ya'gotou. More respect, Fenton. I told you not to listen. [trumpet playing] Dig up. Hi, Dr. Teran. I'm sure your friend must be around here. Tell him not to try anything so we can talk. Hurry up, I don't know if I'm being followed. You're not being followed yet, doctor. Tell him. [Doctor] I know what you're here for. I know because the gringo knows. My wife and my son are staying in the town. They'll kill them if I don't return. Your side is my side. But I can't go with you. Between them being killed and you killing me... I'd prefer you do it now. Because I'll fight back, pal. So you have no other choice but to kill me. How many doctors does the gringo have? One. Alright. [horse neighs] Major Fenton. Your situation becomes unsustainable in Mexican territory. Give me a reasonable time. That's none of my business. You claimed you'd have Villa in a few hours. You've got nothing and you're still in my territory. That's your problem, Fenton. In 24 hours you and your people go back to your country. Understood? [horse neighing] [thunder rumbling] [indistinct chattering, singing] Embijadas, empulcadas without pulque! Take one, take one, enchiladas! Take one, take one, enchiladas, empijadas. Viejorresendez told the gringo there are two of you. Get him. Go now. Tomorrow they'll start incriminating everyone. Get some cazueliada! Get some! Exit town and wait for me there. Chicogrande? Do as I say. You know, ever since I was little I've always liked red meat. They're silent, but know how to do it. I'll see you later. Have fun, honey. They say these are carnivores. Or whatever you call it. Rezendes. It's Viejorrezendes. Just come in. Sit down. So you're one of Villa's men. A woman who sells garnachas told me. They call her Sandoval. That's the one. She didn't lie. Why? Living gets painful as you get old. Why did you do it? Can you tell me where my grandchildren are? All three are Rezendes. Ricardo Rezendes. Manuel Rezendes. Ramiro Rezendes. Are they dead or alive? That's others' fault, Viejorrezendes. It's on abusive assholes. There used to be people here. There used to be work. Where did it go? There used to be animals, livestock. Where did it go? Agriculture. Where did it go? Open your eyes, Viejorrezendes. See the war we are waging. What good is your war for me? Look at me. I hope you never have a son just so they kill him. Maybe that gringo will get you and then Villa. Fucking Villa! And my boys will come back. Let's go. Wait. Let me look at her. Right there. [unsheathes machete] [sheathes machete] [rifles cocking] [trumpet playing] Yes, sir. Yes, sir. No, sir. Yes, sir. No, sir. You can begin now, sir. I'm not telling you shit, you fucking gringo. [lashes] [lashes continue] [indistinct chatter and singing] ♪ If Adelita came with me... ♪ Ah! What's your name? Rosenda. Can you keep a secret? I'm not sure. I'll be right back. When you get back, can you take me with you? [sighs] [breathes heavily] [cannons rumbling] Where's Doria Paz? Where are the Mendietas? Captured, General. All captured. We lost 90 men and their guns. The gringos were sleeping, but we just couldn't hit their barracks. We lost Columbus, General. These gringos are not staying still. Let's see how many hats we end up with. Chicogrande. Go to Palomas. Let them know. Now the gringos are going after us. Yes, General. Hurry up, boys, so the yanks can get a taste of our revolution. And once the reprisal is finished, we'll get to know ourselves better. [horse neighing] Let's fight, you blondies! Let's fight, you fucking blondies! Get down! You fucking scoundrels. Get down, you fuckers! Bring it on, you assholes! Come down here! I'll fight you, you bastards! Let's fight, you fucking gringos! Let's fight, you fuckers! Let's fight! You motherfuckers! Gringos! Let me go! Gringos! You fucking gringos! Stop! Holy Mary. Holy Mary. Holy Mary. Yes, General. At dusk, everyone take their guns. Tomorrow the gringos go back, whether they like it or not. If they get rough, we'll get rougher. Let's see who yields first. Pass it on. Go. [indistinct chatter] What are you doing here? Go home. Go! Go! Don't go anywhere else. -Where's Laurita? -Inside. First thing's first. Anyone backs out, don't even say it. It's too late. If you do it, God bless you. If not, the only option is that he doesn't make it out alive. Right, girls? Ya'gotou. Any of you ever heard of this Saavedra guy? One of General Angeles' men, Colonel. Yeah. That Villista was very brave. I hung him myself along with 20 other Villistas. Twenty of them. [man] After Celaya? We fucked them good. Saavedra was honorable. Definitely. General Murguia had entrusted me with the custody of some captured Villistas. I had precise instructions. "Captain," ordered General Murgia. "Hang all those damn Villistas right away. No delay." He asked for 20 common, gritty ropes. And they began tying nooses. Captain. May I write some lines for my family? She lives in the town. You know? She didn't want me to keep being a Villista. She'd tell me, "You'll see, Miguel, they're going to kill you like a dog." [Captain] I read... "Mother... ...remember I'd be killed like a dog? Today your wish comes true, for I will be hung." "Miguel Saavedra." Captain. Will my neck hurt? [trumpet playing] When I saw Saavedra was dead, I gave the rope to a soldier so he'd tie it to the tree trunk. And I took another one. And so I repeated the operation. [rope tightening] Watching that my horse wouldn't advance too much at first. One single yank and that was it. Sorry that we're making him work so much. [branch breaks] [gunshot] The ropes had scraped my hands and I wasn't done yet. That's why I killed that one like that. My horse shivered like he had fever. It was hard to follow through and kill brave men. I didn't find a branch with enough space for eight. Not even for four. When I delivered the message to Saavedra's mother... the woman had been dead for a month by then. [door opening] [door closing] [door opening] [door closing] [breathes nervously] -Piedras... -Where? Piedras B... Leave, son! [Chicogrande] The gun. Let's go. Take your bag. Either you come with me, you fucking gringo, or you die here. [burps] What's your name, babe? Prudencia, honey, Prudencia. At your service, big boy! What a cutie! I want your ass, Prudencia! Me too! I love big balls in my mouth. In my mouth. Like this, look. [laughing] You're going to have a good time, big boy! I'll be damned if you ever forget this! [man singing] ♪ If Adelita were mine... ♪ ♪ I'd buy a yellow dress ♪ ♪ I'd buy a war ship ♪ ♪ I'd buy a military train ♪ ♪ A military train ♪ Stand up. Put your arms like this. Go, go. Go ahead, run. Maybe that will fix your mouth. You damn asshole. Look at you. [stabbing sound] [festive music playing] [fireworks banging] [people cheering] [woman] Enfrijoladas, pellizcadas, tomatadas! Enchiladas! Machucadas! Enrolladas! Get some! Embijadas, empulcadas without pulque... Holy Mary, now we're alone and helpless. What a shame. This country! Look at these people. They'll be back. Just a matter of time. You'll see. These fucking guys. When? When are they coming back? When they need what we have in abundance. When we don't know how to defend it. What do you mean? They know us. Our customs. They've never taken anything from us. That on the other side wasn't ours. It's all lies! Yeah, all lies. They feed us lies. [Captain] Captain Narvaez. Let the superiors know that at 1300 hours of the 25th day, this guard takes back the custody of the square, restoring order and awaiting instructions. Let it be known and done! [fireworks banging] [soldiers] Rupert! White! O'dougherty! What's that? Yeah, and it makes you sleepy, doesn't it? You damn gringo. We're going to make it, gringo, because Villa has to live. He has to live. That's the reason. Hop on! Look at it this way, mister. My entire life has revolved around obeying the master. That's how my grandfather died. And that's how my father and my mother died. That's how I grew up. Beaten by the master. One day along came a guy who had stolen some cows and gave the money to us. It was Francisco Villa. We were so happy. But the rurals took the money and beat us even more. Me and my family. Francisco Villa later came again as a general and he hung the master. He had the rurals shot and burned the entire estate down. I was so happy I cried. Now... My general needs me to help him. And look at me. I won't make it. Dying is easy. Living right is hard. Look at it that way. [whistling from afar] [whistling from afar] Three months later, General Francisco Villa, at the forefront of the renewed North Division, occupied Rio Florido Square, capturing its military Chief, Carrancista Hortensio Cansino. He was hung on July 4th, 1916, since it was the U.S. Independence Day.
