A Toei Production Looking at a woman with an adulterous and lustful mind is no different from adultery itself. A person who planted a good seed will become a good human being, and his farm will flourish. If a person failed to plant a good seed, the weed will become an evil person. Modern Porno Tale: Inherited Sex Mania Sister, don't you feel scared of having sex with men? I do. It sounds gross. But your lips and skin will be violated by men soon... Yuki...

I was born and raised in this town since my elementary school days. The old town is full ofrobust tradition which rejects any modernity. The town has Iewdness and raunchiness beneath it. But I love this town. This is the town where my mother was born. This is where the only mother I have lives. Ma'am, your daughter is back. Yuki? Excuse me for a second. Sorry about that. Please take care of them, Mina. Yuki! You've grown a lot during the 6 months you were away from home. It's hard to believe I have a grown up daughter like this. That's true. I thought she was your younger sister when she walked in. Stop flattering me. Yuki, this is Mr. Yasukawa. Say hello. Nice to meet you. I am into bowling these days. Stop it, she's still awake. Don't pay attention to such trivial things. No way. She is still a virgin. You're going to moan sooner or later anyway. She will remember it forever. I was six years old when I saw my mother having sex with a guy for the first time. Since then, I've never forgotten her making moaning sounds like a pig in heat. Don't do it! Leave me alone! No! No! Leave me alone! No! Leave me alone! Leave me alone! No! No! No! Leave me alone! Leave me alone! No! Bastard! - Asshole! - What are you doing? - What am I doing? - Not my business! Yuki... Yuki is more important to me than my life. How dare you rape her, you bastard! What's done is done! Anyway, she enjoyed it so much it's hard to believe it was her first time. How dare you! You bastard! She is definitely your daughter. She's very good at it! I'll train her in how to be a woman. I won't let her live a life like mine! Why do you think I enrolled her at the mission school in Tokyo? Yuki! What are you going to do now that your body was violated by that bastard?! It's your fault, Mom! You brought that bastard into the house! Fuck it! I'll kill you myself! Mom! Stop it! Leave me alone! This bastard should die! Stop, bitch! What the hell are you doing?! That hurt! My precious right arm... How can I ever play bowling again? It's all over now! Honey... Are you okay? - Are you alright? - Shut the fuck up! I'm sorry. I couldn't help myself because you did something terrible. I'm sorry. Mom! Stop it! It's embarrassing! - Yuki! - You can't change things! She won't have a normal life either. After quitting school, I enjoyed the Go-Go clubs in Shinjuku. I wanted to forget my bad memories by shaking my ass to the beat in Kyoto. However, my body betrayed my heart and always wanted something dirty. Stop it! Somebody! Help me! Stop it! Hey! - Leave the girl alone! - Who the hell are you? Who are you? I'm Oba from the Kyoyu family. You want trouble with my family? No! Forgive us... Forgive us... Forgive us... Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Would you like me to walk you home? You don't need more help, right? Sorry for the inconvenience. Welcome to my place, everyone! I'd be very pleased if the porno I'll show now shook the hearts of our members here today. - Please enjoy. - Enough talk! Yes sir. Play it, please. Yuki! I'd like to introduce Mr. Kajimura. He is the president of Koto Chemical Shoes. Incredible! Incredible! I've never met a girl like you before! I've never met an incredible girl like you in my life! Would you like to be my sugar baby? I have an unlimited amount of money. How about it? Unlimited money! Unlimited money... - What do you say? - Papa! Actually, I'm into role play. Role play! Role play! Welcome back. I'm tired. You shouldn't overwork yourself like that! What? Yuki! - Did you sleep with a guy? - No. That's a lie! You did! I can tell! Stop bothering me! I was only out dancing! Hey! Don't lie to me like that! I shouldn't have come back! I'll sleep somewhere else! Yuki! I'm sorry! Please stay! It's always the same. You only think about your own emotions. I'm sorry. It's because I love you. That's it. That's all I'm saying. He used to be a high-ranking yakuza of the Kyoyu family who would fear no one in his turf. After living with me for one year, he was heavily injured during a fight. Since then, he has completely changed from his former self. He even quit the clan one day. Finally, he has become such that he can't live without seeing my face every day. The one who really made a proper woman ofme is him. However, because of the injury, he is impotent at the moment. The only thing he can do is arouse me. He is unable to give me satisfaction, though. So, in order to soothe my aroused desire, I look for other guys. How is it? Do you like it this time? - Thank you very much. - Incredible! Isn't it about time to become my sugar baby? I have a stunning house for you. - Papa! Papa! - Incredible! Yuki! Yuki! Mr. Oba, thank you for everything during the last 2 years. Goodbye. Yuki! With two hands... And put it in that way... Right? Like this... Like this... I got it... I got it... Like this... I've been waiting for you. Where have you been? Staying here all the time makes me sick. Whatever, look here. The positions! I've been researching it! Look here! Look! I've been drinking these sexual-energizer bottles one after the other! This is a negligee made in Switzerland. It cost 40 grand. - 40 grand... - Would you like me to wear it? By the way, Papam I saw a cute pair of panties for 10 grand as well. - I didn't buy them to save money. - Save money? You don't have to buy foreign-made panties. There are a lot of panties made in Japan. How about thinking about my money a bit? You're mean... If you act like this, I won't do what you want. Yuki! Don't say that... I've bought a car so we can have sex in it and this house. What else do you need? I hate it! I hate mean papas! - I can't be your girl anymore! - What? Yuki! Yuki! YOu! Yuki! Where have you been? I've been looking for you for a while now. Hey! Live with me like you used to! I beg you! I can't live without you! I won't talk about other guys! Are you really okay with that? Yes. Even if I sleep with other guys in this room? Yes. And would you clean my body afterwards? Yes. I'll do anything! You have to clean it all up with your lips. Is Yuki here? Yuki, Yuki, Yuki... - Papa! - What? Papa? - Let's go back to the house together. - I don't want to. - I won't go back. - You're mine! How much of my money have you spent? Look at all these bills! These are all from your meaningless purchases. Because of you, my company is almost broke. None of my business! Do you think that bit of money made me happy? - Come! Come! - Stop it! Who are you? You bastard! Don't ever think you're a great guy just because you're financially supporting hopeless girls. You've used her enough for your satisfaction! Get the fuck out! I see... You're her pimp. I've been expecting this. Hey. guys! Come in! This guy has some difficulty understanding the situation. I'll leave it to you. - I'll take care of it! - What?! What a coincidence. - It's brother Oba. - It sure is. What are you doing here? How embarrassing. Nobody wants to become like him. Brother, please make our job easy. Don't touch her! I can deal with you! Come one step closer! This blade will be in your guts in no time! Even if I ended up like this, I still used to be one of the top 3 of the Kyoyu family. Hey! Do your job properly or I'll take back those 200 grand! 200 grand! Got it! Come, you bastard! Oba! Your time is over! - You're not even a member anymore! - What?! Never pretend to be our brother again! YOu! Hey! What happened? Whatever... Hey! Wake up! I'll bring some water. Fuck me! Do whatever you want... I can't help myself when I drink. Fuck me! Are you a newbie call girl? Unfortunately for you, I don't buy the cheap ones. "Have I become the kind of woman everybody considers a prostitute?" That thought haunted me from then on. - Welcome. - Welcome. Mother! - Yuki! - Mother! Yuki! Yuki! How have you been? Mother! I'm glad. I'm really glad to see you again. Yuki! This bar opened just 2 months ago. After you left, I thought I had to get out of Kyoto. - What happened to the one in Kyoto? - I sold it for a pretty large sum. Anyway, I'm glad you came back. Now I'm with you and the bar is doing fine. That really makes me happy. This is our maid, Suzu. She is such a considerate and diligent maid. - Nice to meet you. - Likewise. Hey, I'm home! - Welcome home! - This is for you. It's precious Kobe beef. Cook it properly. Yes, sir. We can have some fun tonight! Who's this? This is my daughter. What a beauty! Why have you been hiding a daughter this beautiful? Yuki! This is the president of Tomaguchi Corporation. He helped me a lot. Mr. Tomaguchi runs 6 bars in Kobe. He is going to open one in Tokyo as well. My bar will be his first bar in Tokyo. That's enough. I started to live with my mother again. I used to feel bitter about my mother. Now, I can accept my mother wholeheartedly. Maybe I'm following her life's path as well. Did something happen? Mother, would you go home before me? I have something to do. Is that so? Then, I'll go get my hair done and head back to the bar. Come right away. Thank you for the other night. Who... The drunk girl from the other night? I was so embarrassed. Because of today's outfit, I'd like to ask you out. Actually, I wanted to meet you. How come? - You don't even know my name. - Your name? I can find out your name right away. I'm Yoichiro Honma. And you are...? Yuki Onozaki. - Told you! - That's lame! The weather is too nice to drive. - That's true. - Let's walk. - Spicy. - Thank you. I enjoyed today. - Tasty, right? - Yes. I've been coming here since I was a college student. Well... Since I'm taking care of a research project now, I'm not so different from a student. Yes, Mr. Honma has boosted my sales for a long time. I was so happy when you sent that letter from France saying you missed our fish cake. France? I went to Paris to join a 2-year research project on Gothic architecture. Thank you. How is it? Want more? Yes, please. I feel like drinking as much as I want today. I'm glad we came here. Mr. Honma, you'd better behave well when a beautiful girl like her is next to you. You must like being alone. Don't you want to get married? Why? This sounds like an interrogation... I'm not really serious about that. There is a saying that being a husband is the root of all evil. Being a husband is the root of all evil... I think I understand... However, I think those who say such things are the ones actually made for such fate. Is that right? Are you the daughter of the owner of this bar? Yes. In that case, I think this bar flourishes because of you. Thank you very much. How about it? If things go well, you can have a bar like this for yourself. President... Stop joking... I'm not joking... Mr. President, is she good enough? Of course... I can't find a girl like her in Ginza... Not even in all of Tokyo. I'd spend all the money of Matsumura Finance on her. Stop joking, Mr. President. I like her. Do something. Got it. How is it? Not bad, right? - It's delicious. One more. - Yes. You'll make a great wife. I'll be doing my job properly as well. What? You told me that being a husband is the root of all evil. People are weak. It's not a coincidence. Sometimes things change completely overnight. We are the same in that we don't feel deeply about our parents. I've been alone since I was a child. My mother was always busy with work. My mother was married to a moneylender who only loved his money. She rarely showed affection and was always anxious. She died in a car accident when I was in middle school. It's so quiet. I've never experienced a moment this quiet in my life. I would be so happy if I could stop time. Yuki! Hello. Yuki! I've found good material. Coming to Kyoto was worth it. I'll be back in Tokyo in a week. Then we can... No way! I can't wait a week! I've never liked anyone this much. I'm even scared of myself. Yoichiro, l'm.. Yuki! What happened? Yuki! Yoichiro! I want to see you! I love you! I love you! Yoichiro! Can I come to Kyoto tomorrow? I want to come to Kyoto. Excuse me. Yes? You have a visitor. A very beautiful woman. - Sandra! - Yoichiro! Sandra! From your stories, I can picture our colleagues in my head. How is Calle? She got married and is enjoying a happy life as the wife of a government worker. And Ellen? She left school after the May ordeal with the professors. Nobody knows how she is doing right now. It's been 3 years already... Everybody's life is changing... Not mine. I've been thinking about you ever since you went back to Japan. You didn't write so I assumed our love was over. I just wanted to confirm it. What do you think about Kyoto? Beautiful! I was disappointed by Tokyo but this is the real Japan. I'm glad I came here. Sandra! - Welcome. - The first one please. - 300 yen. - 300 yen. Please come again. What is this cute thing? It's a good luck charm. If you ring it, you will be saved in your afterlife. Yuki! Allow me to introduce Yuki Onozaki. This is Sandra, my colleague during my days in Paris. She is still studying Asian Philosophy in college. - Pleased to meet you. - Pleased to meet you. Yoichiro, do you love her? You mean Yuki? If I said no, it'd be a lie. You don't know about women. - I need you in my life. - Sandra! We have always been friends. Please understand. I'm a woman as well. I feel jealous and want you all for myself. I hate her. Yoichiro! Tell her I'm your girlfriend! - Yuki! - Tell her! Kiss me right now! Yoichiro! Kiss me right now! Ridiculous! Hello! Mr. lmamura... I'll give you a report. Yes. I got it. Yes. Thank you. Professor lmamura just said I should come over right away. But I'm finally here... Apparently there'll be an event... about the differences between modern architecture and traditional Japanese architecture. He needs my material. I'll be back by tomorrow evening. I'm scared... Yoichiro! I can't find Sandra. There was a letter in her room. Goodbye. Ihad to leave for an appointment at home. I don't think we will see each other again. Please make Yuki happy. Sandra... Goodbye, my beloved Kyoto. Goodbye, my beloved Yoichiro. Good bye, youth. She loved you as well, right? Yuki! Will you marry me? Don't you like me? Then why? I can't marry you. My body is uncontrollable. It's dirty. You will end up hating me someday. That's ridiculous! You don't have to feel responsible for the things that happened before you met me... Yuki! You have to live in the here and now! If you keep thinking about your past, that means my love for you is not enough. I have my own shame. However, you're the only woman I'll ever love. Please promise me you will walk life's path by my side. Yoichiro! Have you changed your mind about helping our business? No. I'll continue working in architecture. In order to strengthen Matsumura's business, we need your power. Yoichiro! You should drop that attitude and follow your father. Please don't say something you don't mean. Actually, you don't want him back. It would weaken your position. That's a stupid thing to say... - Father! - Yes? Actually, I came here to talk about my marriage. Marriage? To whom? Her name is Yuki Onozaki. I have a photo of her taken in Kyoto. No! This girl?! What's the matter? Do you even know her? She's a hostess in Ginza. That's not a problem. When I say no, that mean no! Father! I can't allow her into our family. I'll find the perfect girl for you. I refuse. I don't want my marriage to be a means for making you money. Yoichiro! I don't care what you think. We will get married. Idiot! Akihito! Things have become complicated. Do I have to give up on her? You don't sound like yourself, Father. I've already prepared for it. Have you? Isn't it for Yoichirds own good as well, in the long run? Yuki! Excuse me! Hello. This is for you. This is for you. - From Mr. Matsumura? - Yes. - No, I can't accept it. - Why? Why does he give me something like this? Yuki! Have you heard anything from Yoichiro? Yoichiro? The president is actually Yoichirds father. I'm his brother-in-law. I know it's hard to believe. The invisible hand of fate must be behind all this. L, myself, couldn't believe Yoichiro said he would marry you. So, what did Mr. Matsumura say? He was happy about it. He said that he would be happy to bring you into the family. And that Yoichiro has good taste in women. The president is coming together with Yoichiro. Yuki? Why are you standing still? Organize the flowers right now! Sorry. President! Yuki? Of course she's alone. We've brought good booze as well. Okay, let's have a drink before they arrive. After all, I'll be your brother-in-law as well. Of course. To a bright future! Cheers! Thank you very much. You don't have to worry. Even if you can't move, your consciousness and senses are awake. Incredible! Incredible! Yuki! I won't let anyone else have you! Yoichiro can't even appreciate your incredible body Be a good girl! Be a good girl! Stay still for a while! There's nothing to worry about. Even without a paralized body, there are some interesting reactions. Do you want to marry her no matter what? Whatever happens to Yuki, my love for her will never change. Listen! Yuki and the president are in a relationship. Father? - That's a lie! - It's not a lie! Ask Yuki if you don't believe me. - Even last night at Yuki's house... - Stop it! Stop it, please! What if this was revealed to the public? - It would be a huge scandal. - Yuki? - She's not here. - She isn't? - Where did she go? - I don't... I don't know! - Mister... - Yeah? One more... Are you okay? Mr. Honma must be worried about you. Gimme another one! Mr. Honma! Yuki! Did you hear? It's true. I slept with your father. Yuki! I'm that kind of woman. I told you before. I didn't want to make you sad. I'm the kind of girl you thought I was when you met me that first time. Yuki! Idiot! You're a whore! I really thought I loved you. Yoichiro! Haven't you found Yuki yet? Where is she? - Sorry. I'm looking for her everywhere. - That's not enough! Bring her here before the night is over. Tomaguchi! Yes, sir. - Otherwise, I'll reconsider my opinion about you. - Mr. President! Wait. Go away. Go away! Akihito! Please save me! - There is a way. - What is it? He will be happy with a good woman. - What's wrong with it? - Stop it, please! In my belly... Don't make a fuss. - Don't make a fuss. - Stop it, please. Tomaguchi already gave me permission. What? If you don't do what I say, you won't survive here. Your current job or even Tomaguchi. Stop it, please. Don't! No! No, please stop it! Please, stop it! Mother and the daughter are the same. You have the same reactions. - What? You with Yuki? - Incredible! You're as good as your daughter! I'll take care of both of you! Damn! How cruel! You're an animal! I'll tie you up! Animal! I won't do it! Damn! Matsumura! He did this cruel thing to you! I've suffered a lot in my life as a toy for men. There is nothing left in the end. Mother! I'm here! I'm here! Yuki! People may call me a slut, but I've raised you with all my heart. Mother! Yuki! You should live with a strong heart from now on! Mother! Mother! Mother! Mother! Mother! Mother... Mypoor mother... My mother... I finally understood the emotion called hatred. If the law won't punish him, I'll punish Keiichiro Matsumura. - Congratulations! - Thank you. Thank you. Happy Birthday! You're even more attractive today! Your compliments always make me happy. That's right. I would like to introduce this woman to you all. She will be my mistress living in this house. Her name is Yuki Onozaki. Please be nice to her. Yuki! You're good at controlling the president with your seductive skills. I'm the mistress of the president. Please be careful with your words. You don't even care what others think. People say a woman's grudge is the scariest thing in the world. Remember that. - Having fun? Do you know her? - No. Don't! You should not get involved with my father's mistress! Ayaho! I hear there's an interesting party at Akasaka. - Would you like to go? - No. You are only interested in those kinds of things. Fine. - I forgot that you're frigid. - Quite understandable, isn't it? It's a marriage of convenience. My father needed a man like you, who can do evil things without even flinching. That's enough. Such an impressive life! But I'm not into self-made men. Who do you think you are? You act as if you were royalty. - You're just a moneylendefis daughter! - Don't touch me! lt gives me chills! I don't want to touch you either. Akihito would be furious if he found out I've been doing this for a year. - Please... - What?! - Make me suffer... - What?! Punish me more! Wait! What should we do this time? How about tickling? You like it? Hey, you fucking pig! Bitch! You're a freak! Bitch! Sow! Hey! Excuse me... I've been waiting for you to visit me. I've been waiting for this moment as well. Wait. I would like to tell you an interesting story. It's about Ayano. She is having an affair with Mr. Tomaguchi. It seems it has been going on for a while. Ayano or me, who do you prefer? She was so good at it... She sounded like a pig in heat... How do you know this? This key will open everything for you. No! I have to go back soon! Actually you want me to keep at it, right? You don't have to worry about it. If you like Ayano, you can keep her. I didn't marry her. I married Matsumura Finance. What you said is true. Even if you make this public, there is nothing you will gain. It will be your shame. Tomaguchi! It's hard to control this woman. Akihito! Let's drink to our future. Here you are. To your happiness! - Mr. Akihito! - Yuki! I can't be without you any longer. - Fuck me! - Not here! I don't care. Come to my room tomorrow night. I want to enjoy the last night. Alright. Got it. Papa! Good morning! What time do you think it is? It's almost noon! Is it? I have a meeting at 3. I have to go overseas tomorrow. I want to enjoy one last night with you. You do? He's from the Liberal Party. - I might come home late tonight. - I don't want you to be! I can't wait that long these days. Please be back by 10. I'll be waiting for you with makeup on. It's open. - You are... From Yuki's house... - Yes. But I'm going back home today. I wanted to see you before that. About what? Please meet with Yuki. She really loves you. No way. She betrayed and damaged my love. That's not true. Yuki is the victim here. Your father drugged her in order to have sex with her. The same thing happened with her mother as well. Father? Akihito! You son of a bitch! You dog! What is this commotion in the middle of night? Are you going to kill me over this woman? I can't let an incompetent person like you run this company. How dare you... I'll kill you! Can you shoot me? Good! This completes my self-defense claim. I'm going to kill you! You son of a bitch! You're just an old moneylender! Matsumura Finance will be mine! Matsumura Finance will be mine! Listen! I'm the president of Matsumura Finance from now on! You and this house are all mine! I'm the master of this house! Listen! You are my slave from now on! Nevefl Stop it! Yoichiro! Don't come near me! Don't come near me! You bastard! I'll kill you! Kill me? Nobody can kill me! This house is mine now! - Get out! - You are an animal. An animal wearing a human's mask. Stop it! Stop it! If you have to shoot, I'll shoot! You mustn't shoot! Yoichiro! There is no place for you in this house anymore. Get out! Shit! Yoichiro! Shoot me as well! I didn't mean to drag you into this. Shoot! Shoot me as well! Yuki! Yoichiro! You did this for me... That's right, Yuki. This is the only thing I can do for you. You became a murderer because of me. I'll be hanged for the murder. But the one I killed was an animal. An animal. You fool! You're a fool! The End
