Utena Tenjou. How do you Iike your first day of schooI? WeII, I'm sure I can enjoy it here with a cute girI Iike you around. Do you think we'II get aIong? I'II show you around schooI. What's your name? Wakaba Shinohara. Hi, everyone. If you can hear us, Iisten to our voices. We are the Ohtori Academy Broadcast CIub duo, E-ko-- And F-ko. Bringing you the noon hour schooI show. It turned out to be a cooI, beautifuI day today. If you brought your Iunch, you can enjoy it outside. You shouIdn't try that. You'II be inviting a capricious passing rain. Wait a minute, the weather report never said anything about that. The rain in my heart is sure to cIoud the sky above. Did you get dumped again? - What about me do you not Iike? - So everyone. If you're going to scribbIe mischiefon your boyfriend's back... ...whiIe he's napping, make sure he doesn't have swimming cIass the next day. Tra-la-la Say, Wakaba. Ah, yes? The High SchooI buiIding-- What is it? The Fencing CIub. It's very popuIar among the girIs. Look, it's the Prince. The Prince? You are good. But I haven't given up yet. You Iook better pIaying the piano. They're so popuIar. Of course. It's Jury and Miki. The Iady with the curIy hair is Jury Arisugawa. She's the captain of the Fencing CIub... ...and an able member of the student counciI. Next! AII the girls caII her the Prince. Perhaps, she'II be your rivaI. And the boy is Miki Kaoru, or just Miki. He's onIy first year junior high... ...but he's the super-genius, aIready taking severaI coIIege cIasses. He is cute and popuIar... ...but his twin sister interferes... ...and he can't find a girIfriend because of that, they say. Hey? Utena? Where are you? It's started to rain. It'II soon stop. I hear it's a capricious passing rain. How many years has it been, since we Iast met Iike this. Remember our promise to go to the pIanetarium? We've yet to go. Don't get me wrong. How's that? I'm not who I used to be. I didn't come here hoping to find you. But I'm surprised. That you'd be at this academy. How come you're dressed Iike that? It's the prince. After we separated, I decided-- ...that I'II Iive with high goaIs. For my high goal girl. That ring. I see. You're engaged to someone. This led me to this academy. The mark of the rose. Roses. A white rose. And this? What is that? Are you not afraid? Are you not afraid, standing there? So many roses. This is my rose garden. Yours? I'm the headmaster's sister, so I get special treatment. But... But in reality, I'm the one captive to the roses. What did you come to this academy to do? I came-- I came-- It's mine! It's the mark of the rose. How do you know that name? What are you doing? What are you doing to the rose bride? The rose...bride? Only authorized persons are allowed here. I see. You are also a duelist. Duelist? Pardon me. You aren't a familiar face... ...but I see you do qualify to come to this square. Qualify? What do you mean? Huh, don't play dumb. The mark of the rose. Wait! Do you know what this is? Huh, what do you mean, what? This mark of the rose is the proof of the duelists... ...those who may win the rose bride by duel. Duelist? To win you? Oh my. You possess the mark of the rose... ....and yet do not know THAT? Perhaps you weren't meant to be my match in duel after all. This led me to this academy. The mark of the rose. Anthy, prepare the duel. The one who loses his bosom rose loses. Do you have a sword? Sword? Do you really know anything about the ring? This is your chance to take it off. How vexing. One isn't permitted to duel without a sword. I have a sword. Wait a minute. Any complaints now? Very well. Saionji, sir, it could be she-- The bells toll to start the duel. You forget yourself, Anthy. Don't you hit your girlfriend! My girlfriend? She is the rose bride. In other words, since I'm the current winner of the duels... Watashi no subete "chuusei" nishite ...she's my POSESSION! Possession, you say? Possession, you say? Are you really trading a girl around by duel? Are you reaIIy trading a girI around by dueI? Regardless of how she feels? Answer me! Does everyone who owns one of these rings duel in order to win her? Does everyone who owns these rings duel in order to win her? Does everyone who owns these rings duel in order to win her? Her feelings? What are you talking about? Her feelings? What are you talking about? You understand nothing! She is the rose bride! You understand nothing! She is the rose bride! You understand nothing! She is the rose bride! You're the one who doesn't understand! You're the one who doesn't understand! What? Is there a girl who's happy to be traded through duels? Is there a girl who's happy to be traded through duels? Oh yeah? You are...a girl? You are...a girl? I never said I was a boy. And I'll never lose to anyone who hits a girl. And I'll never lose to anyone who hits a girl. Let's call it quits. You really don't understand anything. Let's call it quits. You really don't understand anything. It's now over! Anthy! One isn't permitted to duel without a sword. One isn't permitted to duel without a sword. What? I'm blinded. Sword? Who is it? It's me, Anthy Himemiya. Good evening. You just moved in, and it's already so tidy. I was about to go to sleep, and I don't invite people to my room. Then, I shouId leave for tonight. Silly, I'm not letting you go home. Of course not. What is this? It's the mark of the rose. You know it, don't you? Those who possess it qualify for the duel. That Saionji guy, he said he duels everyone because he wants you. What does everyone get when they win you? You're so funny. Miss Utena Tenjou. Call me Utena. Well, how do you do, Utena? We'll get along. Won't we? Do you always do this with the winner of the duel? I'm the rose bride. I obey the one I'm engaged to. You're so thin. Cut it out! Playtime is over. Go back to your room now. Say. You have so many cute clothes. So what? Do you have a problem with that? Not at all. Knock it off. What were you thinking? You're weird. She's weird. What? Talking about the prince again? Yes, the girl wears the prince's clothes now. But she's probably still dreaming of the castle with the prince. Which reminds me, I used to have a prince myself. But the prince was killed. A childhood friend of mine did it. The prince liked her, so when she fell off a boat, he drowned saving her. So stupid. My prince and I were supposed to have gone steady. But the prince went missing. So I will never forgive her. I'll make her be the prince for the rest of her Iife. Hey, cut it out, Wakaba. Ow! I see that you've been chosen as a duelist. You said this ring led you to this academy. Then are you also trying to win her? You can say that. Why? Why? Of course because she's attractive. Do you know what kind of girl she is? What kind ofgirl is she? - She's weird. - Really? Because...anyone who wins the duel, she'll... What? She's the rose bride. Of course, she'll spend the night with whom she's engaged. Have you ever won a duel yourself? And did that "engage" thing with Himemiya? That shouldn't be any of your business, should it? Anthy Himemiya. Ready, set! What shall we do tonight? I told you yesterday. I have no need for the rose bride. Really? This prince who has won you is so indifferent. Indeed. My, my. Look, we're all soaked now. Of course, you can't help but to get wet in a pool. Oh, Touga. Hmm, why did my sister imprison the rose prince? Anyway, the mob then stormed in. That was something to deal with. Open the door! Give us back the prince! Open up, you witch! Witch! Witch! Yes, my sister was really a witch. She had magical powers. But there was another secret. What was that? The rose prince was really the lord of the flies. My sister, the witch, used her magic to change him to a prince. So when my sister's magic faded, the prince returned to his true seIf. So that's why you set up this game to regain the lost magic. But I'll be the one to gain it in the end. What are you trying to gain? What do you mean, what? Don't try to hide it. I know you're doing things I don't know about. Don't move. We can't go back to the garden where we were together. But you'll always be precious to me. You traitor. Where is she going at this hour? So she's the rose bride. When I was a boy, I grew out my hair, as told by my father. That's what the customer wanted. Customer? My current father. I was sold. I lost a lot ofthings, but thanks to it... ...I could partake in this academy's duel game thing. I know you'll win. You won't lose to Jury. To Jury? Because - she's gross. She doesn't think anyone knows, but I saw it. Saw what? She always wears this pendant, doesn't she? She has my photo in the locket and stares at it when she's by herself. I could throw up already. This became a rumor, and I'm so haunted by it. I wonder who was spreading that rumor. Win the duel and punish Jury, please. I don't know. I plan to win the duel, but I can't be cruel to Jury. Why can't you? Duelists have high goals. This darkness leads to the End of the World. That's scary. I feel drawn in. It will soon begin, the revolution. Why are you a duelist? Because I was chosen, of course. But you could have refused. I always wish to obtain more power. That's so mean. And you, Jury? You so despise the rose bride. Why do you participate in this game? I want power so I can be free of everything. What is everything? Everything that constrains me. We're alone like this. Do we have to talk about these unromantic things? Shiori! Ordinary students aren't allowed in here. I'm sorry. I know I shouldn't be here.. What's the matter, at an hour like this? I felt so lonely. I wanted to see you, Jury. Did something happen? You're a duelist, aren't you, Jury? How do you know that? I know other things too. Like what? For example, about that Utena Tenjou girl. What do you know about her? She likes Touga. That's why she stubbornly dresses like a boy... ...so she could become a duelist. Playing prince because of some guy? It's wrong for someone like that to get the power... ...to revolutionize the world, isn't it? Granted, that doesn't make her too likable. You'll win, won't you, Jury? You'll be the one to win, right? Oh, yes. I'll beat her good in the next duel. What constrains Jury...I see. Utena. What's the matter, at an hour like this? You're tending to your roses at this hour? Because I'm the rose bride. I must have said something to offend you again. Do you really do those things with anyone who wins the duel? Such as? Are you, perhaps, curious to know about Kiryu? Perchance, is he your-- Be quiet! What do you know! It was you, wasn't it? Touga-- Touga started to act strange because of you, didn't he? You, wasn't it! It was you, wasn't it? I thought he'd be beside me. He was when father and mother went away. I thought he'd always be beside only me. We said we'd gaze at the stars together forever. Stars? There is no prince. Himemiya. Listen up. Listen. Form pairs and draw each other. Don't get bogged in detail. It's important to capture your partner's essence. It's a nice day, so you may work outside. Himemiya. Wait up, Himemiya. Wait up, won't you? Himemiya! Himay! Hee-may-mee-yah! There's an observation room up there. Are we allowed up here? It's all right. No one comes here. What a great view. I'm sorry about last night. Thank you. What about? Don't be so mean. I got so emotional at you. But you did things for me-- Never mind. You are engaged to me. Um, can you stop saying "engaged"? I'm not going to be dueling. You don't like me after all, do you? It's not that. If we're going to be close, let's do it properly. Last night, I got back to my room afterwards and realized I felt better. That was unexpected. I wondered if talking about our problems... ...and helping each other were the simple things I just needed. I wondered about that, in my rare moment of honest thoughts. If you don't mind, won't you open up to me a little more? I want to be your friend. Let's keep no secrets like this rose bride stuff. But you don't tell me anything... - ...about yourself. - Shall we switch now? Hey? What is it? Let's rethink this. Why is that? Do you have to ask why? It's important to capture the essence of your partner. Let's keep no secrets. All right, is this what you want? Now... I-If I'm the only one... ...being the model, it isn't fair. That's true. You don't have to do that. Say-- Himemiya-- This painting-- The model in it-- Is that you? I'll teach you the reason... ...why everyone wants the rose bride...me. What-What is this? I got a big scoop! There's a mondo scandalous painting in the back of the headmaster's room. This is controversy! Oh, but I've obtained an even more controversial videotape! Now, this is a very scandalatious tape. Here we go! Chu! - Chuchu! - Moo! Moo! Moo! Moo! - Pao! - Pao! - Pao! - Aroo! Moo? Chuchu Moo! Chuchu. Moo! Moo! Chuuu! Mmph! Kew! Chu. Chuchu? Chu! Is this really your scandalatious videotape? My mistake. And now, for the real scandalatious videotape! Here we go! Oh, it's acting headmaster Akio. This must be back when he just got engaged to the headmaster's daughter. He's such a textbook example of a prince. So young, yet competent and kind and has great looks. Thank you, but you flatter me. Is this really a videotape? A good-looking guy goes well with a nice car. Oh, but this car won't run. I lost the key. Welcome home, dear brother. I'm home. That's right-- I heard Akio takes care of his sister. They are truIy close as brother and sister. But the scandal starts-starts- Starts here. The surprise secret of the rose bride- Is- Is- Is-- Himemiya, what is this? This is the secret of the rose bride. Jury is on the defensive. She's good. Jury is on the defensive. She's good. Jury is on the defensive. She's good. You're pretty good. You'll be a good match against my club members. You'll be a good match against my club members. But you don't seem to know... how much playing prince halfway is going to cost you. The mark of the rose doesn't look good on you. I can't afford to lose! Do you love Touga that much? What is Jury talking about? Who is this Touga? See that? That...That is the castle of eternity. That...that is the castle of eternity. Castle? I haven't been in there myself... I haven't been in there myself... ...but I hear you can have anything there. Eternity, miracles, everything that glows. Eternity, miracles, everything that glows. Perhaps your secret wishes will come true, too. Perhaps your secret wishes will come true, too. That's what it means to win me. That's what it means to win me. Or will you still... Or will you still... Throw away your mark of the rose? Are you already down, your prince liness? Are you already down, your prince liness? It's-- My, my, are we still playing prince, Ms. Tenjou? So brave, Ms. Tenjou. You think you can fight with a stance like that? For a moment... ...you looked it. Extra! Extra! Extra! Akio! Akio! Akio! Cap'n, Cap'n! Have you heard? It's the headmaster. It's the headmaster. Yes, it's the headmaster. We were wondering where you were. And it turns out you've been six feet under. So we wonder how you died. Someone buried you, after all. Then who's the one who did this thing? Cap'n, Cap'n, have you heard? Cap'n, Cap'n, have you heard? It's the owner of the flowerbed. The reason for her rose bed... ...was to hide her brother dead. If you need proof that I must show, Watch this tape and you will know. Watch this tape and you will know. Hey, it's-- The scandalatious video I found! When did she get it? Himemiya did this? Himemiya? Himemiya! The prince... Himemiya! Himemiya! You weren't asleep? Himemiya! Himemiya! How long? How long have you been awake? Have you never been asleep? Did you always only pretend to be asleep? Don't worry. You are my prince, dear brother. You can do with me as you please whenever. Don't talk like that! I'm not like that! Himemiya! Himemiya! VISITING ROOM Himemiya! The key! The key! The key! The key! I can't find the key! Key? What are you talking about? A car without its key is stuck and goes to rust. Where's the key! The key! The key! Where's the key! Calm down, dear brother. You're the prince, so you can do whatever. You don't understand! All engaged couples, please wait in the back. Utena. Touga. Where is Himemiya? Why do you want to see her? Do you also want the power to make miracles happen now? Does such power really exist? Utena, what do you think is the meaning of the game at this academy? Everything here is built entirely around the prince. Yet, there is no prince in the flesh. That's why this game is necessary, in order to fill that void. When she became the rose bride, the castle of eternity showed up. That's right, when she killed her brother, the prince. That's not true. There never was a live prince to begin with. I'm finally starting to remember. What about? About the time we separated. The time when you disappeared. I forgot it for some reason since I got here. Don't you remember, a boy drowned in the river by our school back then? Maybe that happened. It did. There was a girl who fell in the river from a boat. A boy jumped into the river to save the girl... ...and he drowned instead. Why did I forget that until now? Help! Help! Someone! Someone come quick! Utena--Won't you come with me? I'm right here now. I'm always thinking of you. I'll promise to love you until the End of the World. Isn't that enough? Let's be happy here. You said that back then too. Someone, quick! Someone! That night, when I was crying alone in the chapel... ...you gently embraced me, saying how you thought of me. Wait! Thank you. You really were my prince. What's the matter, Utena? Oh no, a girl is drowning! Wait! Don't go! Don't go, Touga! No, I have to go, or she'll drown! But, Touga! You'll die! Touga! Touga! Tooohhh-gahhh! Utena. I finally found him, Utena. You were my true prince. You're now the prince of the academy. Any miracle and all eternity are yours... ...as long as you stay in this world. No. Let's go. To the outside world. Let's go. Himemiya, let's go! To the outside of this world. No, I can't! Himemiya! Utena! Utena, is that you? The key! I can't find the key! Key? A car without its key is stuck and goes to rust. Where's the key! The key! The key! Where's the key! Let's go, Utena. To the outside world! ...CAUTION... ...DANGER AHEAD... ...YOU WILL DIE Hi, everyone. Are you all cruising?

Today's main event is about to start! Currently, Anthy Himemiya is in the lead all by herself. Of course, there's only one car, so it's naturally the lead. You're not supposed to say that. Extra, extra! A black car is gaining from behind! She's fast. Are you surprised? It's a big mistake to think you're the only one... ...who can turn into a car. I'm a car now too. She plays rough. I won't let only you do something so spiffy like escaping this world! The one who's really spiffy is beautiful, is me-me-Meeee! Oh well, the black one just crashed. Anthy Himemiya leads all by herself again! What's going on? The black cars are increasing in number. You know that bad things come in packs. They are really increasing in number! They're like devil! I've never seen a swarm this large! Where did they come from? Hello? Hello? Did you enter a tunnel? Extra! They went into a tunnel, so we can't transmit to them for a while! Well, excuuuse me! Breaking down? I can't get any speed. No good...help! Utena! CAUTION, TRAFFIC AHEAD SLOW DOWN We have reception again. We can finally resume our broadcast. What do you know... ...it looks like the problem was taken care of while we were out. It looks like friendship saved the day. You can get onto the left bypass up ahead. Why? You're heading for the outside, aren't you? High goals attract good company. I know you can make it and find the outside. We plan on following you eventually. When we meet outside, I'll be there to seduce you. Good work. You should reach the exit soon. The exit? To the outside world? Yes, not that we've seen it ourselves. But it should be near. Wait. We have visual of something. What is this? A castle? Is this the landmark for the exit? It's a trap! That's not the exit! Run! You'll see a bypass to the left in a kilometer. Go down there and come back to our world! I'm not running anymore. The exit is probably right there. What gives you that idea? Let's go! To the outside world! Extra! Now scanning the inside of the obstacle ahead! Extra! Now scanning the inside of the obstacle ahead! Extra! Now scanning the inside of the obstacle ahead! There are countless tires of roaming racers. There are countless tires of roaming racers. There are countless tires of roaming racers. There are countless tires of roaming racers. There are countless tires of roaming racers. There are countIess tires of roaming racers. It seems to be the tires are there to crush any intruders from the outside. It seems to be the tires are there to crush any intruders from the outside. There's no way to get through there. There's no way to get through there. They sure have a nice job. Left! Extra, extra! The exit is near! Commencing countdown. Extra, extra! The exit is near! Commencing countdown. They made it! Brother! That's right, it's your prince. You don't have to be afraid anymore. Let's go back... To that closed worId where you can be a living corpse. My condolences. You can only be a prince in that world. But I... and Utena, too... will leave, for the outside world. Don't. You'll only end up at the End of the World. That may be. But we're going ofour own will. Goodbye, my prince. I see. That's too bad. But you'll have to continue to be princesses back there. It's easy. You just need to be a living corpse. Grant me the power! To revolutionize the world! ANTHY HIMEMIYA UTENA TENJOU So, we're now headed into a world without roads. Perhaps we won't be able to make it there. Utena, I understand now. We were born in the outside world. Then we're returning to the place we came from. I understand now too. Why you sought me and I didn't reject you. We were together in killing the prince. That's right. The outside world has no roads. But you can always build new roads. That's why we must go. As we travel, the world will get bigger by that much, I'm sure.
