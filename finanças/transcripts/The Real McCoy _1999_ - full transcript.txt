Tomorrow I'll fire the starter pistol when we'll sing... "Time is matter," said one genius. "Don't waste it," continued the genius. Andy said, "I just took." Fuck, I don't care about anything. "Töölö Hospital, 9 May 1998." "The well known rock star, Antti Hulkko, aka Andy McCoy, age 35,- -has under unclear circumstances fallen from the balcony on the 3rd floor." "Blows 0.05% in the breathalyzer." "Have used diazepam." "Pupils normal, symmetrical." "Hulkko is conscious, but does not orient himself in time and space." "Noted injuries: Right thigh broken." "On the same leg, a fracture of the calcaneus." "Contusion around the eye. Broken nose." This must be the wheel of karma. I've beaten up so many dudes that now I got it all back at once. Hi! How's Birgitta? -I fell a little. -Here you get a soft... But it didn't go bad in any way. This leg sucks, and that... What a show. This leg is broken? This, and that heel. -The surgery is tomorrow. -You came from some outer space. Of course I came. I came back to Finland. I just sat there on the edge. Didn't have even a jacket. Some kid yelled, I looked down and lost my balance. -I still got hold of the railing. -That's why you survived. I screamed: Angela, fucks sake, I'm sliding! The fall itself was quite fast. Then you start thinking... Andy needs to be aired out. You've such a Lutheran upbringing- -that you've always gone in the middle of the road. A very religious upbringing. The Bible was always on the table. No doubt. Only the one blesses, the Romani court. And Saint Sarah saves. -Sarah? -Don't you know? She's the saint of the Romani people. You've to throw shots into the sea when Saint Sarah is underwater. There you've gypsies! You see! See, see! Head first into the stone wall, here we come. Where's my Strat? This next song is like... Of course this sounds bad, but... -...I forced Andy to sing... -Forced me to fool around. I cannot force. But then he forced himself, so it's OK. OK, let's go. Sex doesn't matter. You don't want it. Because you feel so fucking good that you don't need anyone else. -You've everything. -You're the center of the universe. Pure heroin, damn what a feeling! I can't even touch it, it's so seductive. 12 years just went by like that. You've made so much money, no need to think about what to do? I've $3,000 here in my wallet. -Why do you've $3,000? -If I see something I like, I buy it. And what if you get tired of this job? What do I do then? Hmm... I'm going to sell my ass in Amsterdam. Amen, happily ever after. Gravity, it's pretty... How would you say it? It's tough love. You feel... It feels like... you belong. When you get taken down like that. This is how I'll invest my money. My flat will look like this. Is it...? If I've weed? Yes. How much do you pay... ...per gram? You smoke right? The Only natural stuff that you can't get stuck in. You can smoke for ten years and won't miss it if it runs out. And hey, listen. The only one to cure glaucoma. It's the only cure for cataracts and asthma. How do you feel? How are you? I feel like I'm waiting to be relaxed. I'm not yet. This stuff is nice. This is used to calculate the oxygen level in your blood. When you open this, here is a red light. The light means it's working. If it goes out, it might still work,- -if it's only the light that's gone. Or this whole thing is broken, gone haywire. I don't understand what drives these people. Now they are bringing medicine because I'm in so much pain. Don't know what's wrong with them but they cut the soles of my feet. To begin with, you are not in pain because the legs are numb. No but... Stay in the role. The patient reception. The brat is whining, the cat is horny The woman has a nationwide pain that torments Just let the guitar sing Grandma hates the rocking chair, drives HD across Finland Just let the guitar sing Reijo Taipale said it well, no need to hold tango competitions,- -when everyone knows who the Tango King is. -Tango King? -Is it Eino Grön? -No way! -Well, who's it? -Well, Olavi Virta. -Ah, you mean the dead dudes? Oh yeah. -You mean the living ones? -Huh? -Elvis? -Living ones. -Why not Elvis? -Do I speak any dialect? Living... Have you heard of a living one Presley? Have you heard of the living ones Presleys? Too much debt, the back bends The pay slip in the hand is changed to a bottle Just let the guitar sing Olé! Sometimes it feels like the world is going like a balloon towards a cactus park Just let the guitar sing Today in Pori. Goodbye Turku, hello Pori. -This is the only way to live. -Are there any others? In Pori they say "er well". "Er well", is that local slang? -"How's you sleep's?" was Turku. -How's you sleep's? That's a sick language, fuck... -"Er well" is Pori. -Er, well. But it's cool when you know where the guys are from. The same thing if you go to Rovaniemi, you get that feeling,- -that it's quite alright - say "peace" or get a punch in the face. Today is Finland's 70th anniversary... ...80th, Independence Day! Everyone must be quiet, now "Finlandia" is being played! We're no longer Finnish bastards, now we're European bastards. Ah, blues oil. A bit of Brownie McGhee... The lame will start walking soon. But the nice thing is that you're a loyal person. When he does something, that's it. Even if he shows his little tricks, that he smokes all your cigarettes,- -takes your money and drinks half of your coffee, without even enjoying it. He only tests in passing if it tastes good. But when it really matters,- -not once does it happen that he would let you down. -It's about that. -...messing up a gig? -Nothing like that. If we talk about important things. And plays the guitar when needed. And sometimes when it's not needed. It's absolutely true, dammit. There was the List Show in Finland, 20 years ago. We made an LP together, it became a legendary record. This song was number one for so long that they had to change the rules. Hey, something has been achieved! Sister, I want to stay The highway is hot The lights of the city are calling to me I want to explain The boat is waiting To me you're a dream The world is real... -Troll. -Troll, damn... Did you think humans can fly? Not so easy to take life... ...of some people. -So what's up? -We've run around. The same. -The same? -One two three four. Oh, I came up with this book. Now you've time to read. -Well, now I've time. -What day of the month is it? -Today is... May. -The 13th? May. There. "Andy get well!" A good photo. You look just like an Orthodox. The place is called The End of the World. A religious book. But it's good. Religion sells in Finland. All rock stars write religious books. Well, religion and hospital atmosphere are good. The main thing is to believe. We're at Helsinki Pantti. This is a pawn shop. When I travel I often leave guitars at pawn shops- -because they're safe places to store them. The history of this guitar is incredibly interesting. This is an extremely rare Les Paul, model L5. A very good friend of mine owned it before me,- -Albert Järvinen. You know the Hurriganes. Too high... not so high. More like beibe beibe, can you see... Beibe beibe, zägä-zägä... Add drum fillers. Play now. Järvinen died in the same hotel as Hendrix, so- -this has been called "the cursed guitar". If you play with this everything will go to hell. There comes another sound, dammit! Dan-dan-dan... Give me a quitar, I'll go there. We can change its nature. It can work. Live for it! It's good. If he's fit, it's good to work with him. But if he had daisies in his hat for too long, it won't work,- -because the flowers wither quickly, especially in winter and in the dark. I-I'm Romani, I'm pure blood. My bloodline comes from Rajasthan. I'm here to check out my gypsy roots- -after we came from Northeast Rajasthan. A fun trip. I woke up, asked my friend, Vesku... Hey! ...I asked where the hell are we going. I thought we were on a domestic flight in India. And now that dude offers me a Finnish beer. Now. Finnish... Wow! Unfortunately, smoking is not allowed in the building. Dammit... What the fuck are you staring at me for? Yeah, the world is a strange place,- -when somewhere there is ice- -and somewhere there are coconuts in palm trees. At the same time! Oh my God! It goes beyond the understanding of a normal person. Toot toot! The phone is ringing. "Wait! Andy here." "I'm in Moscow, fuck! I'm here now. How're you?" I said that come here quickly and bring the guitars. Turn up the volume. And these Finns are just drinking. This doesn't make any fucking sense. There is no politics other than that the liquor store sells. And what the hell are these white caps? The whites... God these idiots... The booze is drunk at a deadly rate. It's not even funny. Look, they are kept in chains. Isn't this world made for freedom? Free Winnie the Pooh! Take off the chains! Today and now! Andy, buy Julkku! Damn good student humor. I don't like stude... I dropped out of school when I was 12. Would that interest me? Fuck it! Hi Andy, happy May Day! -La puta! -Give me an autograph! Andy... Check my last name. -Hulkko... You're Antti. -I'm Andy. Always been Andy. -Are you really a cop? -You saw my papers? I saw, I looked. But don't be so mean to little boys,- -they don't know what they're doing. But the older ones, dammit, if you find powder, cage them in... I've lived through it. You don't see me in those circles. I'm sure she's with some white guy. May the Romani court bless you. The cop... Good day. What are you doing here? Good day. What is your case? Well, we stayed here. I visited a friend and... ...I picked up an old guitar case. Can you show the case so we can see what's in there. -You've every right... -Please, step aside a little. -What are these? -Hallelujah, these are the keys to heaven! I'm a believer. I'm a Jehovah's Witness. Nah, just kidding. I found it there, next to the garbage can. Thought I could hang them on the Christmas tree, for the kids. -Alright. Do you've any ID on you? -Let's see who we're dealing with. -I'm just Andy. I don't have my passport with me. But I can provide the information. -Your official name? -Andy McCoy and Antti Hulkko, both official. Antti Hulkko... -Social security number? -11-10-62. Double Libra. -You are this musician? -Everyone has their job. Now when you meet the artist live, can you give your autograph? I've done a lot of them. It's a well-rehearsed thing. -There, go ahead. -Thanks. -And good luck. -Good luck. The road is open, now we go! -What's the matter? -The keys have been stolen! -What kind of keys? -There are two of them, about 70 cm long. They sit together in a ring. They are silver. They have been taken from the statue of Saint Peter. They are the keys to the kingdom of heaven. -Andy McCoy. -Andy McCoy? Play lower. Play lower. -Didn't you record it? -I said I'm not recording yet! -That's why I said it. -You didn't say anything. Sure, I said. -Record now, dammit, when he plays. -Wouldn't he practice the riff? Say cheese! Let's go. Is it on? Break. -Break. -One more time, I can better... -Not so aggressive. -OK. Break. Go for it! Wrong sound. -Shit. Otherwise good, but a small sound. -One sound! -Good start, yeah.
