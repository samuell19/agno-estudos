Get up, Brooke. Let's go. Five more minutes. Where's my headband? I knew I lost it. You'll be great. How not to carry a snack in a box any more? I guess that's good for school. And they opened a cafe across the street from the school, then the kids could leave n sheep for a snack there. I like that. - Really? - Terrible. It's not a dog food. I would never let your sister eat dog food. How handsome you are, Mum. I'm nervous about my first day of class, and you're not? We did not. If you were my professor, I would fall in love with you in two seconds. Hurry up. In five minutes, let's go. Good. What are you going to school like this? Nothing will happen. Honey, I want you to wait for them at 3pm, okay? I know, Jean And you. Kysten, check the bus schedule. Look, I have something quick to do at work, if you need anything, let him call me home, okay? Good. Nothing will happen. - May I leave in peace? - Everything is under control. Go. - Where's my raft? - On the counter. Thank you. I knew it was there. Good? Brooke, Brooke, don't get separated. Good. I want you to remember everything that happens today, so to tell me tonight. - You can. - But without making up, okay? Can. Goodbye, Mum., We love you. You love us too. I love you both. Kisses. Hi. My beauties. You too, Mum. Will we be so crazy when we are mothers like her? No way. Black and white. Colouring, colouring. Two o'clock. Yes, collage. Pink, orange, just that. Yes, listen. Get on bus number 4, I'll wait for you where we agreed. Number 4, okay? Please, my brain is capable of getting out of nothing, and I'll expose it bus secrets number 4. Good morning. - Hi, I'm Brooke. - Ah hi, I'm Deny. How are you? - I'm fine, Deny. - Do you like your teacher? - Yeah, not bad. - Napkins. Napkins. They gave me the wrong combination or something. You allow it? - Yeah, whatever you want. - Let's see. 26, good. 24, here it is. That. - Take the money and run. - You can. Thank you. Take it. Thank you. Worth it. Brooke, we're going to our house. Yeah, we'll be late for the bus. Okay, come on. Goodbye. Kids, wait. You can go like this, but you have to get home by 6pm, okay? Clear. What did I say? At home at 6 pm. Yes. Be good. Goodbye. All right, let's go meet Brooke at the bus stop. - Can. - Goodbye. - Is the medium good? - Yes, medium is great. Hi., Hi, how was Jean's first day at school? She hasn't arrived home yet, but she will soon. Great. - Isn't that...? - I told her to take that bus. - Weird. I guess he missed her. I'm going to pick her up. Mr Ellioson. Brooke was wounded in Nicols Routs Street. What? Lies Wounded in Nicols Routs Street. What? What? She says Brooke is lying wounded in Nicols Routs Street. - Can you take us there? - Yikes. Of course. Let's go. Why did she go down Nicols Routs Street? Makes no sense. For God's sake. Oh no. Stay in the car. Don't get out of it. One, two, three, four, five, carefully, six... - Brooke. - Seven, eight... She's my daughter. Brooke. Stabilises her neck. Brooke. Ready for transport. One, two, three, carefully, carefully Guys, follow me, guys. Let's go, one, two and three. Where are you taking her? To an international hospital. An accident, an 11-year-old girl. She had tachycardia so we had to intubate her. Pressure: 90/60. We were able to reimagine it. Heart rate: 120 per minute. There were inhalations and exhalations at the pump of a thousand. Ready to transport? Just be quiet. One, two and three. What is it? Tell us. I can only say what we know for now... which is that he has a major neck fracture, broken hands and a concussion. The only thing we can do is wait for him to wake up. Disabled, how do you know? The accident left large marks on the brain and cervical spine. Love, breathe and calm down. I'll present you an operational plan. It will be a difficult operation. She's still alive. And as long as she is alive, there is hope, but be prepared for the worst. There it is. The night will pass quickly. Grandma, when will we be able to see Brooke? I do not know. Stupid, stupid, why can't you ever do what you're told? Stupid Brooke. The longer your daughter is in a coma, the less chance she will have of becoming aware. We'll give her another 36 hours so she can regain consciousness. Doctor, and if... and when he wakes up from whom, what happens? We have to take into account that when it comes to consciousness, it will not recognise anyone. Your friends made this great poster and everyone signed it. And you have another gift, sweetheart... new teddy bear. Look how cute he is. You will be here to see him when you get better. - U s t a n I Brooke. - Brooke. Brooke, do you dream? - Brooke, are you nervous? - No, I'm very happy. Watch out., Let me go, my head hurts. - You tell me in the evening, but without making up, okay? - Brooke, get up, Brooke. - Kids, wait. Get up, Brooke. Get up Brooke. Usttaannniiiii Brooke. Stand up. Brooke. Do you know where you are? - Brooke, Brooke, come back. - Brooke, Brooke. I'm your mum. Brooke. Brooke. Hey. Brooke. Do you know who I am? - Do you know who I am? Blink once for days and twice for no. Yes, exactly. Brooke, do you know what happened? Calm down. We assume it's an accident. You're in the hospital. Everyone here is making you feel better. I know you have a thousand questions. We'll answer anything when you take out a device that helps you breathe. At least we will try to answer you. Mum and I are here, is that clear? - You will be fine. - Okay. You will be fine. Good girl. Probably the car hit his feet. And what will be the consequences for the legs? I don't mean to amputate her legs. He is already paralysed from the neck onwards. Excuse me... can I talk to you out there? - Of course. Of course. - Honey, I'll be quick. And I'll talk to you. No one knows that my daughter will remain paralysed. And I forbid you to speak about it before her... and if you ruin her positive attitude, you won't stay in this hospital, are we okay? Hey Brookie, here I am. Do you know this thing is getting out of your mouth tomorrow morning? Yes, from the mouth. You will be able to speak again. Does it hurt? Are you ok? The hospital is here to remove your pain little by little. - Nothing hurts her, baby. - It's good. At school, everyone asks about you... I'll tell them you're okay. I love you. Emergency intervention was good. Now that we have located the problem, we can stabilise the neck and send her to rehab. - But it's only been six weeks. - She's not... yet. We have done everything in our power... - Wake up. - Hi. Hi honey. Brooke can open his mouth, but he can't talk. But it can shape words by word of mouth, that's the best part. Hi lives. Do you think... can... they can... go back... to school? Can you go back to school? Do we mean to go back to school, do you ask us that? - Not. - Not. - We don't think you will go back to school, than we guarantee you. - Don't worry about it. - You promise me? We promise you. I promise you. Sorry. Watch your mum. You might be a little scared of the new environment... you may also be sad. So I brought you just in case a lemon-flavoured candy, I'll put it in your pocket. But don't eat them all right away. Goodbye honey. I love you. - Time to go, Mr Ellison. - Alright. I love you too, Dad. All right, follow Route 49 and Route 47. I'll drive behind the ambulance. I know, but if by any chance you break away from the vehicle and you don't see the rotating lights. My vehicle won't run away. I know, I know. Kysten... there are tickets at 3:30 pm on Mondays and - Fridays. - Jean, I'll give you some money. Yes, it can. Thank you. - If you need something, you can buy it., Alright. And Reed... has to be in bed by 9pm, okay? Love, I know. Don't, don't, don't, don't. - Try to guard yourself. - I will, come on. Hey, I'll call you in a while... You know. - I love you. - I love you. Hi, I'm Jean Ellison, I'm accompanying my daughter Brooke. Are you here to leave your daughter to care for us? I pray? Will you leave your daughter here to live permanently? We do not know. We're here for rehab. I'll direct you to your room, the nurse will come quickly. There. - Thank you. - You're welcome. There are many children your age. Hi. Hi. Okay, thank you. Sorry, did you say something? Do I have something in my pocket? - No? - My pocket., Your pocket? Daddy's candy? Now you will get one, and for dessert one. We'd best find someone to give us an idea for... landscaping. We didn't meet Dr Brown, but I found your account from your $21,000 office. Yes, I'll wait., Kysten didn't want to go to school after school. - Why? He says he is not feeling well. She went to bed before dusk. Do you think I should take her to the doctor in the morning? You don't know... Second, Mum. Yes, the account number is: 8230. No temperature, but... I'm worried. He's a doctor consultant. Well, I guess that's Dr Shilds then? Means that. Okay, do you receive credit cards? Okay, thank you. If you're not going to open your mouth, we're going to have to force you, so choose yourself? Hi honey. What is happening? We have a problem, they won't take medication, they won't open their mouth at all. And what are these drugs? Style sofender, vitamin and sedative. - And what is a sedative for? - Make it easier to fall asleep. - But she's going to school, she has to be awake. Mrs Ellison, we know the needs of children with tetraplegia, and these kids can't go back to school... Ah no. But look they can go to school with a custom program. We'll wait and see how it goes. Leave it on the table, so I'll make sure he takes his medicine. Thank you. Good morning. You have to start learning that when you get out of here you can go back to school. That's what we'll do. But first take the vitamin, open it. Now the other one, and let your sister take her sedative. And get him in the ass. Oh my God. Are you new here? Yes I am. Where is the injury to your child? Which vertebra was injured? The injury is to the neck. C2 Is she on a respirator? For now it is. My boyfriend was injured with a vertebra C6. He can breathe on his own, but his brain is destroyed. Sometimes he seems to recognise me, but I'm not entirely sure. I am very sorry. What do you think it will be when you bring it home? Not. I can't even bring him. Let alone nurture it. But thanks to the drunken and stupid 60 year old my son will live with. And my husband. I'm not alone in this one. Many mothers are divorced here. It was not appropriate for the husbands to have children with disabilities. Hello, sunshine. And... I'll call you. It's cheaper if I call you. Hello. I'm sorry. We're in a big crowd here, baby. Jean. Jean. I can't do this. This is very difficult. Jean. Honey. I'm sorry. Brooke, here we are. How is this managed? Where are you. Where are you. Don't fire. - Oh my God. Where's that button? - I'm looking for him. Not here. Oh, here it is. Oh, he's stuck. I have it. Now everything is all right. Do not Cry. It could have been worse. Ssss. We love you. Everything is fine now. It's over. Keep sleeping. Are you done with that thing? Just not. Ed, you'd like to stay home tomorrow. But it takes 15 minutes for this. I'd like you to take a few days off. I cannot afford this because the cost of the hospital is too great. I know, that's why we'll give you a paid vacation. Have a week off. To go see your daughter. Thank you. - Your family comes to see you. - That. - How would you like to say hello to them, with a voice? What is that? This is what we use to start the throat. Yeah., He also helps with vocal cords so she can talk again. Do you want to try? Honey, you wanna try it? - Yes. - Excellent., He agrees. I'll inject this into my breathing apparatus. It's painless. It's over. - Can you say anything? - I... feel... weird. I sure sound stupid, right? Well, it's the most beautiful voice I've ever heard. Really great first words. I was expecting something like: a small step for humanity or How can your country do something for you? But this, I like it. Hey. Hey. Wait, wait. Listen to me, you know Brooke can't move his head, so speak straight to her and look straight at the cart. - You can. - Hang on. Her voice may be strange, but she tries not to feel bad about it., Can. Let's go. Hey., Hey, look who came to us? Hi... Reed..., How are you? What's up? You have a little weird voice, but don't feel bad for him, okay? Come and give me a hug., Hi Mum. - You grew another 3 inches. - At least three., Look what I have for you. My... books. Maths... and the Red Carriage in the Wild West. It's a good book. Excellent. Why is the piano locked? Because nobody can steal keys. Because they are easy to steal. And how is it here? Hey Reed, let go of that key. I succeed. What else have you taught him since I'm gone? - Reed. - What about Kysten? What? He has a weird look. It is as if the ball was blown. Honey, come here. How are you? Let your mum give you one half. I believe you're having fun eating alone. I'm saying it seriously. Also give me two plates of dessert for that table over there, please. Your grandma doesn't cook? Of course she cooks. And ingenious. Don't you like this food from the hospital canteen? I haven't tasted it yet. I also see that you're not even hungry. - You just mix it on a plate. - Am I doing something wrong? You're not doing anything wrong. I just want you to eat. Kysten, you're very thin. I want you to eat. - Good. Look at me. I know this is hard, I know. Just listen to me please do your best to stay strong and healthy, okay? Deal. - Yes? - Okay. You say agreed, and again I don't see you eating., Mum. Okay. Bobby, please get me off the respirator. She asks for it every day with her mother. I want to show you how I can breathe. Okay, let me see. Okay, I'm ready. Have you seen? I was breathing a little. That's perfect. I'm ready to try again. Get down on the ground, Brooke. You cannot breathe without a respirator. Okay, look, honey. I have to go get some things done at the front desk. - You were fantastic. - Thank you. Can you come with me to help me? Of course. Listen up., I don't want to give her false hopes. - What do you want? Hope is hope. I don't want you to take that away from my daughter. Is this hope for Brooke or for you and your wife? The family must understand and accept the fact that your daughter is a tetraplegic And that she would be connected to a respirator for the rest of her life. Does it seem fair to you that Brooke believes that when he returns home everything will be as it was? Someone will have to be with her 24/7 because if the respirator goes off and no one is with her. It will die in a few minutes, that's the reality. You don't know how this will develop. Look, we're not trying to change what was, rather than trying to teach them to live with it. I also need a second mortgage to renovate the house for my daughter. I can't get a wheelchair to the door. The social service will do its job, it can be any moment. And only on that condition can I bring her home. Listen. Ed, I'm so sorry, but I can't grant you a loan. Dad. What that...? Are you ok? - Hi. Hi. Yes, I'm fine. - What are you doing? What's Dad doing? I do not know. - Reed, do me a favour. Get a metre from the kitchen. - Is running. Come on. - Yes. Dad, what are you doing? It's my mum's favourite flowers. I know, honey, but it'll bother you here. - What are you saying? - I'll make a ramp. Measure the door. See if it's 16 inches? You can. But why? Because she could pass the cart from Brooke. - It's exactly 16. - Oh, really. Come here. And measure this staircase. Can. Thank you. It is missing 30 metres for the ramp that I would walk to the door. What have we got? - 7. - Okay. Stand back. Carefully. Hey. Do you need a few hands to remodel your house? Ah... what a victory. You shot me in the corner., Napkins. Hey, how come you came, Alan? Well I was around with my motor team there so I said take the opportunity I visit this smartwatch. Ooo. Hi Mr Linski. Do you have any questions? - What's on the shirt? - Read it for yourself. Devils... in hell. Devils in hell. What did you hear about the devils? That they are in hell. Devils and angels. Are there really angels in hell too? Yes, if you don't study enough and don't care about the environment. The devil will come? Yes, but luckily you will have to go through many more periods. Because of my condition, right? No, because you're still little, and to my knowledge, girls have to learn. But we can do this. Page 3, Chapter 7. Let me see if I get it right. Medically covers the appliance only if it stays in the hospital, But not when he gets home. Okay. Can you send me a sketch? Yes I can make a copy. Yes, thank you. May I have your name, please? Yes, your name. I prayed to God to give me fear, when that fear becomes overwhelming, I will tell him to take it off my back and give me happiness... If my daughter prioritises something, then it's definitely a respirator. But when he gets home, it's gone. That's what you're saying. Yeah. Thank you for your time. Tell me your name, please? Give back what doesn't belong to you. Loneliness... Until dawn tomorrow. Do you read her story? That. Red carriage in the Wild West. We came to 5 chapters. Let's get her attention and change her catheter., I'd like to know, too. - What? It. Sir, the bureaucracy doesn't scare me. This is the work of the social service. Yes, I will send it to you and I hope it will be more than enough for you. May I have your name, please? Thank you. Yes, have a nice day. Idiot. It must rotate every two hours to prevent infection. I... decubitus, skin care, In this case, don't be afraid. I'll show you how the catheter works. Look where I'm going..., You pull this tube in as it goes and the first urine will come out. - There we go, there There... And that goes in the bag, okay? Okay where we forget. Forget it. Brooke, look. Everyone's working on your new room. - Hi kids. - Hi Brooke. Hi Brooky. This will be your new room. You will get a new big bed. It's beautiful, isn't it? - Say hello to Brooke, guys. - The house is being renovated. - A little while. Brooke, let's eat on the ironing board. It's really an ironing board. I want to play you a song, but the piano is hidden, so I decided to tell you a joke What is the peak of the blind man? Living in the street of good view. How great. Kysten, it's Mum. That? Hi honey, you will do me a great favour. - You can. I know I'm not a good mother right now, and it bothers me., How is it? I try to bring her home, though I still can't and I need your help. I need you to help me take care of my youngest daughter because I won't be able to do it alone. Do you promise to help me? That. You don't say that because you have to? Not. - Just go home. Brooke and you. - Yes, we try and do our best. - I love you, I love you so much. - I love you too. - Alright. Good night. - Goodbye. We first need to put a spiral plastic around her spine. We need to stabilise her neck above her spinal cord. The operation is not easy and we cannot guarantee success. How do you define success? That she survives at all. Then we have nothing to talk about. None of the surgery. We can't force anyone into surgery, but if we leave it as it is, one wrong move could kill her. Two more breaths and we start surgery. Implant., Implatat. - Let's do it. - Pliers., Klješta. - Nothing. - We got her. We're. Let's turn her on her back. Carefully. Connect it to a respirator. We burn it. The respirator is in operation. Everything went well. We'll wait for her to recover for a few days, then she can go home. Hello. Here we are. Here we are, Hey. We made it. - Really good. - Look, there's everybody. Let me see you, team. One, two and three. Welcome Brooke Ellison. How are you, kids? - Welcome. - Welcome Brooke Ellison. Ready? One, two... and three. Okay. - You okay, honey? - Yes. - Good. - Thank you very much. I'm home. That's right, and we'll try to keep it that way. I made up a joke. How does an adventure among the stars look like? How? We don't know how? Shines only at night. No no no., When is it coming to throw the trash? Look, you've become smart. - I'm glad you're back. - I'm glad as well. I'm sorry, I don't understand you. Just a moment, please. Headmaster from school. She says Brooke can't go back to school. Hi, I'm Ed Ellison. Yes, I'll take care of it. Excuse me, please tell me your name, please. We wish all the best to your daughter, but taking care of her is not in the description of our school. There is a cost to a doctor who cannot take good care of her. We are also concerned about what your daughter will challenge between students and professors. It can feel incomoded for its damage. We end the meeting. Mr Evans. Excuse me, hello. I'm Jean Ellison. Brooke is my daughter. I'm so sorry for the accident. Sir, my daughter wants to go back to this school more than anything else in the world. If you do not have a suitable sister for her, I will go to her classes. Are you expert in this? Not., That's what I thought, you're not qualified to care for her. I've been watching her for nine months and 24 hours a day, I can pass that qualification. Excuse me... I can do it. Brooke has been studying and is ready to return to class. - Sorry, that's impossible. - Why, why is it not possible? The board and her doctor must approve you as a caregiver. I'm sorry, madam, but as the law says from this there will be nothing. Mum, Mum. Isn't it time you prepared me for school? Okay, here I am, honey. Good. Good girl, good girl, good girl. We're almost done. - Is it comfortable? - Yes Okay. Okay. - Comfortable? Yeah. - Good., Good. We're almost done, baby. Excited? That., Yes, me too. Although I'm a little nervous, Yeah, me too. - Is this nice to you? - Yes. I'll brush your teeth. Good. So. The teeth are clean and now we go. - Good morning. - Good morning. How I look? You're the most beautiful girl I've ever seen in my life. It's not true. Except your mother when I first saw her. I'm not., Of course you are and I won't let anyone say otherwise., Cut it out. I'm lucky. Did you see my... It's in the bathroom. Thank you. It's never going to change, huh? Not. - All right, ready? - Yes. The moment. Good morning., We talked about this yesterday... That's right. And I said... Here's a letter from a doctor saying I am qualified caregiver. I can't know. The letter is quite cheesy. Help a little. I am grateful for all the help. - Hi Mr Lynskey., Hi. - Right., Hi. Good good., Okay, open it. Here. And let's go upstairs. Come. And worse., Good., Good., Thank you. Really good., Really good., And here we are. Hi., Hi. I feel we're late. Will not be repeated., Good. Good morning. Here you go? Thank you. I will sit with her from now on., Yes, of course. - Hi Brooke. - Hi. Hi., Hi Brooke, how wonderful. Welcome Brooke. Come here., Here. Come here., Wow, how handsome you are. All right, children. Begins. Welcome geometry. Now I will write a word on the board for those who do not know the word. Geometry. - That word, what does it mean? - Set of numbers. That? Set of numbers., Exactly. So a set of b r o js. Who can tell me what a rhombus is? Yes? Body., Romb is... I leave it to you to resolve these light points. Give it a thought. So the circle is X + 40-2. The circle is X, what do you get? - Circle, circle. - Mum, mum. Brooke? A line down the middle. A line down the middle. That's right. Line down the middle. Snoozed, snoozed. Okay, now take the calculators for this question. You have a cylinder which has a diameter of 2 inches that is the same as its depth, which is its volume and scope of this cylinder? Brooke? 1.37. Bingo, we got a winner. 1.37. E team, do me a favour, so repeat this chapter at home. Hey Reed, try it. - Are you there maybe? - Hi, Kysten. Hi. We really want to know. I will be the fastest button in the competition, thanks to this., That. Give it another go. New Yourk Looking for talent in physics. Our reading reads: The word lazy is a substitute for? The figuration of the word is information that the person is exhausted., Correct answer. She knew. I do not know. But there must be another question. If Adam was writing on A4 paper, how much light did he need? The most powerful bulb. Exactly. The most powerful bulb. Last question: What happens when an orange is electrified with a yellow cloth? - Neon. - No. - Cullen? - That's anger. Anger. Exactly. Teams are ready for the decisive question: - Sometimes there is a reason... - Pressure. I didn't finish the question. Please listen carefully. Sometimes for some reason the pressure jumps, is it because of the pressure or why? Because of the reflex. That's right. Because of the reflex. Ladies and gentlemen, these are the winners of the 1997 New Yourk talent in physics. Brooke, here's a letter from Harward. Yes? Do you want me to open it for you? That. Dear Miss Ellison, We liked your notes so much that I could be candidate at Harward University, we only have one more place. Mum, do you hear this? Let me hear. I think this is a sign that I should go to Harward. I believe another sign will tell you not to go. How did they dare to send a letter when they did not know her situation? That is not fair. Too bad for them. - Jean. - Yes? A letter came from Harward. I don't know if it's inflammation? I don't want her to be disappointed. She's grown up. Brooke., That? A letter came from Harward. Do you want me to open? Yes Yes. Congratulations. Oh, my God. Oh my God. What? Congratulations, you entered Harward University next year I have to sit. I can't believe it. What would happen if I could actually go to that university? You're kidding, right? What's missing from Johnny Birds School? Nothing, both schools are beautiful. But still Harvard is Harvard. But Harvard is not here. Which will travel for five hours every day, I don't think it will. Mum will come with her. Super, great for us, great for dad, life has finally returned to normal and one letter will ruin it again Kysten. Put that letter in your ass. - What do we do now? - I think Harvard is her dream. We're stuck in the water down to our throats. - Now we have to raise our heads. - Yes. Although... There is always some interlative I mean, if Brooke is realistic, everyone will look at her there as a kid who can't do anything. She'll understand. Not. The problem is with me. I can't leave, I can't leave Kysten and Reed, neither can you. Maybe seeking help from a personal assistant is worth a try? Impossible, how will they live without me? - She can live without you. - Do not give. We think it's best to start with a list of possible problems. If Brooke comes to Harvard, she'll need a special wheelchair room. And a 56 square foot bathroom. Yes, if you don't have the right staff for her, her mother understands and will live with Brooke. And he will accompany her to lectures. For classes that will not be accessible due to wheelchairs. Brooke will need transportation. This will give you an insight into our economic situation and... our limited expenses for... clothes... and desires and needs. Thank you, Mr Ellison. - Excuse me, are you done? - Yes, I am. We need to see how to meet all these needs and talk to the homeowners, but we believe we will meet all these needs. - Wow. - Good., Good., Thank you. Then we guess we'll think... I think the university will faint if you show them how talented you are. I love you. - I love you too. - Goodbye. I love you. I love you. Good luck. Thanks for coming. Goodbye. Goodbye. - Take care of your mother. - I will. If these kids are teasing you, write down the names. Thank you. Good. - Hi. - Hi., I'm Brooke. And me, Lee. I'm like this because I was hit by a car at the age of 11. Joining pages will not be a problem for me. Hi, my name is Jack., Hi, nice to meet you. Hi, are you her mum? Yes, Jean. - I'm glad. - Hi, I'm Mory. Hi. How are you? Our system has something we call neurons and one is very special, and that is what drives our body and helps the brain make contact with the other one. The neuron separates from the other and when it does, it is called in physics Synapsis. I think no marriage, if honest two minds are vicious, that love is not love, if you always change for the moment, distance is always distance or not, it is just perhaps a false happiness smouldering in silence. Hi, Caren., Hi girls. What's up? The love story will be tonight. A love story with Dan Onill? I don't know who that is? I'm wasting my time. It's best for me when it comes to Porshe. Hey, will you have dinner with us? Second day. I hope to get in touch with someone tonight. Have a nice time., Hi. Hi. All the girls seem to have boyfriends. No, it's just Caren's second. And one will come to you. Do you really think that? Yes, I think every person in the world finds a soulmate. Let's go. Joseph Conrad said while writing that the likelihood of the universe judging us was high. What is he really talking about? This is a great question. I think he blurs his natural world ethically. - I think Conrad is too graceful. - He plays God. It's okay to play God sometimes. Come on. I expected more from Harvard youth. I think Conrad's words seem to make him visualise the universe that he doesn't even have those words explained. I have a feeling Conrad... judge yourself as if it were a human God., That. Set. Conrad was threatened with the truth, so he didn't even dare to ask. Maybe he didn't think about the mud, but maybe... he was talking about France, what do you think? It's Saturday. What do you think we order Chinese food for? I'm not very hungry, Mum. - Hi Jan. - Hi. I just left something out of the door for you. Yeah? What did you leave me for? More recently than Frodor Dimistrovsky, He knows it as I do Conrad. What Chinese food do you like most? From the ground. How about we order it now? Can. Excellent. Thank you. Chinese, huh? Good idea. Are you done? Yes I am. And you? Yes, thank you. - Then, I'm going... - Yes. Make yourself some tea. Why do you like Conrad as an author? Think about it... he's a great maestro in English poetry. And he didn't study English until he was 19. What else? He lived intensively, sailing the entire world, absolutely every bit of it. I believe that poetry is very similar to Conrad's. But we don't have to look far from her to find the story. I hope you don't mind this question, but how do you control the stroller? I have a system in my mouth. I have a language with a lot of talent. You think I'm lying? Let's see what's in your fate cookie., Good. Look... he says you're going to share a cookie with someone who has never written in English. Let me see. Thank you. What's in yours? You will meet one special girl. - It doesn't say that. - No, it says exactly that. Are you sure you want to call us, Cara? Yes, what do you say? Brooke. My hockey colleagues. Animals. Do you like hockey? I love hockey, but I don't play it very well. - I would ask you something. - Shoot? Will you dance with me at the end of the year? - No, no, but thanks. - No? I'm glad you asked that. Don't make them feel sorry for me. But I don't want to go with anyone else. If you're not coming with me, I'm not going either. There have been disasters in recent years. Is that a yes? Still going? I'll get a ticket for your mother too, okay? - You can. - You can. Thank you. - Want to hear something weird? - I love weird things. By the way, that flower fits you really well. Ah, thank you. It's gardenia. It's beautiful. Now tell me what's so weird? When I fall asleep and dream I am never in a wheelchair. Only one. When I flew about for the first year. I dreamt I was like this. In the cart. And what do you do in your dreams? I dance everywhere. I dance to exhaustion. - Okay, so here we go. - But I don't... I know I can't dance, but I like to go easy dancing. I will miss this place. Especially you will miss me. You're an amazing woman, Brooke Ellison. You'll miss the girls. You trust them? Not me. I'll be back next year. - Oh, how cool. - Gold, - Until recently. - Until recently. - Have a nice summer. - And you. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Hi, Mr Ellison. Hi., I'm Jan Dylan and I'm a friend of your daughter. We're soldiers, I see. What a boy. Jan. Hi. Hi. Honey, what bothers you? Jan is done with the studio. They won't be coming back. By the way, why don't we call him... this summer, say the Fourth of July? Jan travels promoting Joseph Conrad's words. Joseph who? Dad, Joseph Conrad is a writer., Oh. Okay, how about Thanksgiving? It's November. Before Thanksgiving is Labour Day. Labour Day is not celebrated. What does he know. He's Russian. It's Slovak. Slovak, the better. Ok, are you going to tell him Labour Day is a big family holiday? Only Christmas is bigger than him. Wait, I'm back for a moment. Jan. My sister wants to tell you something. - Reed. - What is it? Hi, I'm sorry. Only... I mean I know you're travelling... And I don't know if there's any chance of you returning to America by November but I would love to have Thanksgiving with my family, You know people have a traditional Thanksgiving dinner. - My mum's the best cook. - I would love that. That? Really can? Ok then. Okay, see you then. Have a nice trip. Hi, Jan. Hi., Hi. Let's go home to celebrate this. If you've been doing this all summer, you're weird. We have mail. Two packages are from the library from the university. The university sent the final paper for Brooke. - You think? - Of course. Who do we know in Madagascar? Jana? - Yes. - Open it., Read. "Dear Brooke. At the moment, I watch the sunset on the Indian Ocean in complete silence. Joseph Conrad shared justice, so I try. Now I'm heading east to Mambo. Forgive me, but I can't return to the US until... Thanksgiving, but now I have an email address. Please stay in touch. Love you. Jan" He misses you, but he does what he loves. He travels the world., That. How could you call me a nerd? When you're so smart, why did you get confused? - I'm not stupid. Who says that? - The one who eats the bread? I know that. Who are you going with? You're being critical. He's talented and has a knack for joking. And it can't be more convenient and it's not a parasite. And he has a nice smile. They're kidding you. - Team, we have to go., Oh no. - 50 minutes., Good. - Goodbye Brooke. - Goodbye Brooke., See you later. Come on. - I am not hungry. - But you have to eat. But I'm not hungry. Then can you comment for us when it's over when the guy meets the girl? Is it possible that...? I need to turn you around. - No, it's not necessary. - Of course it is. You have an open wound on your butt. You haven't had her... since rehab. If you had eaten as God had commanded, this would not have happened. - Do you hear me Brooke? - It's not that bad. Of course it's terrible. If you get infected, you won't be able to sit in your wheelchair. Are you planning to write a final paper from bed? Stop torturing me. I'm torturing you? Hey, I have to get up every two hours to turn you around like a baby and then I'm torturing you? Mum. Mum. It's over with Joseph Conrad. I'm a victim of Joseph Conrad. Turn off the light. Nothing. You have to eat. Alright. I give up. If you give up, so will I. But you will never give up. So if you need help getting you off the bed, this spirit will do it for you. Do I get a ghost? Don't ever leave me, Mum. Your company is uplifting me and therefore I could finish this study. And lastly... What mother would do this for me? There is no room for me in this world, Mum. You can't know that either. You will be in this world for a long time, But you have to decide if you want to belong to this world and be paralysed? You. So... what do you want to do? Get up and go out and watch the sunset or rest? Pass me the laptop and headset, please. I will finish my essay and graduate thesis. I've never been in a love depression yet, but I don't mean to give up on Harvard right now. And I decided to find a job... maybe at an old elementary school. What? Groups, standard: 25 Number: 9550 Number: 4 Fifth point, ok. - Honey, just a minute. - Okay. Open an email. Insert. "It's cold today. Where are you? Pusa. "Send. Where are we? Molekule. Calculator, please., That. Mum, are you okay? You're cold. No, I'm just excited about this calculation. - I'd work all night, why not? - Because... it would kill you. Okay, it wouldn't kill you, but it would kill me We menopausal women should not rise at night. I have to go lie down. My peace and pain don't know for a long time. "Chapter 6 Discussion" "The results of this study... are the courage, the informing... of a close assistant, residency and optimism in the life of a teenager." Done, almost. Almost. I change clothes and I'm done. Mum, the game is not over yet, it's actually just begun. Now I have to defend that essay. I want to believe the truth. Hey. How are you doing? Is it bed time? Ten more minutes. Tomorrow is a great day. You need to rest. Post. Open the mail "Sorry, there was no contact here. Big news... I'm engaged. Jan" "Congratulations." Are you ready? What happened? Tell me. Jan is getting married. Not. It just wasn't for you, my sun. I know it doesn't help now, but there is no man who has not broken his heart. But everything will be fixed when the right man arrives. Mum. That? If that doesn't happen to me, will you be fine? That. But I will not lose hope that this will happen one day, will you? Not. Not. What standards do you think you can offer the system for those who are different? I believe my last name has the potential to change the system. My call is not specifically specified. How did you prepare the stand in which there is hope, residency and reality? I just brought you a barrier analysis, residences, and you can compare that to to those of Hope Street colleagues. He brought us the same report? That. After the graphics were done, I spent all night invoicing. An invoice with a theme, it proves that it actually connects the city as a residency as in colleagues. Good. I believe it went well. Well done what you indicated... on the one when you opened all the cards, don't you think? I hope. Rest, rest. - Let me see., First., Safe? - That. Then it is. Come in, please. Miss Ellison, we have examined your theory of positive thinking how you see peace in the world. Another thing? You have done a wonderful job for public policy with a price and so please to continue doing these static analyses for peace. Thank you. Thank you. Good girl. Congratulations. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, best regards Brooke Ellison. Good afternoon. When I first came to Harward four years ago. I, too, have said goodbye to many of my parents. Like everyone else, my dad left, but my mum didn't. The presence of the mother, though it is an unusual occurrence I believe that everyone accepted her, that she had no social problems no matter that some are here just for the sake of wealth. My mother was with me every hour and every day. She followed me in all my classes, from the first class to the last test, Although we don't like being controlled every moment because of our hormones, We wouldn't be here if they weren't... put in their effort and watched us when we needed help on this long journey. I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for my mother... But without all of you. Some of you have a divorce from your parents, professors or friends. You just need someone to tell you the right word at the right time... then no one would run anywhere. Love and care for one another. My mother and I learnt a lot from each other. We hope that period is behind us. And one more thing, I would never hurt anyone. The weather is very fragile... and strong. Tomorrow I leave Harward... with my mother and you wonderful people. Miracles exist. It happened to me, and it happens to you. Just love the people that are in your life whenever you see them. Congratulations to all and God bless you. All right, all set. Ready? Yeah, just... can I have a minute? Of course. After graduation. Brooke holds a BA in Public Policy from Harward University. Jean went with her. Brooke is pursuing a PhD at Stony Booke University near Ellison House Ed and Jean are together again.
