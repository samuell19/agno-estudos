Once upon a time, there was a King and Queen. Who have a very beautiful baby girl. They ask all of the fairies in the kingdom of Olivetta, to come and bestow blessings upon the child. But, unfortunately, they forgot to invite one of them. It's gonna look awfully silly if we can't come up with the name by the time we have to make the announcement. Look.. Ah, the kingdom will rise like the dawn for her. Perfect! Then that is what she shall be named. Finally. An heir for my kingdom. To carry our wishes and our dreams into the future. You make me so very very happy. As you have me, my love. I bet she will have your... courage. And your kindness. And she shall have your beauty. And stubbornness. This is a moment of great celebration for Olivetta. Nothing could spoil this day. Lords, ladies, enchantresses from the three kingdoms. Fair and beautiful people of Olivetta. We have invited you here today, to celebrate the lineage of this fair kingdom. Please, come! And welcome. Our first born and heir. Princess Dawn. May you find true love evermore. Your heart will always lead you to the truth. May happiness and love guide you all the way. What's this? A party I was not invited to. Queen Violet, King David. I am slighted by your exception. Queen Tambria, we meant you no offense. We sent heralds into the land to announce of the birth of our child. I heard nothing. Perhaps, due to the inaccessibility of your abode. My abode is where you shoved me in the corner of your realm. Might I remind you, Queen Tambria, when your kingdom was demolished, we harbored you, out of the kindness of our hearts. I only am here to bestow a gift upon the child. You may. Dear, sweet beautiful child. My gift to you is this: By your sixteenth birthday, you will receive a prick by a spindle. And in payment for your parents' offense. You shall die. You evil, putrid soul.. A curse that has been done, cannot be erased. And so I cast a spell upon her grace. Until a prince does play his part, and come to her, pure of heart, she shall lie in protected sleep. Until true love's kiss with passion deep. The kingdom too shall sleep as well, until this kiss... ...doth break the spell. You paltry little nymph. As everyone here slumbers, I will take over the kingdom. And it will be mine. And as for you, Tambria... ...death and destruction will be your only companion. That which you covet will become overgrown... ...and your power will be subject to this one throne. Guards! Stop, Tambria! We're not through with you. But I am through with you. Don't you know that my power is so much more glorious than yours, as you shall see. You have killed my sister. Now you'll pay for your betrayal. You shall remain in this kingdom alone. For as long as the spell is in place. I will no longer be slighted. And you shall all rot in hell. To prevent the evil curse from ever coming true, the King ordered all spindles to be collected and burned. Until not a single one left in the kingdom of Olivetta. Please mama, can't you make me a cloak for winter? You know you mustn't ask such things. The King also ordered a wall to be built around the castle. And Princess Dawn was to be locked away for her own protection, in the Ivy Tower... ...until her sixteenth birthday came to pass. Come in. Mother! My dear girl! You're so excitable. I apologize. But, my sixteenth year is almost upon us. And, I cannot wait to get out from my chamber. - Will there be a large party tonight? - Yes. - And, will everyone in the kingdom be there? - Of course. Even the boy who brings the bread every day? Tell me about him. I see him from my window into the kitchen each day. Has he seen you? He's quite handsome. Is he, now? Perhaps, I could meet him someday. Perhaps you can. In the meantime you should keep up your studies. No one likes an unwise princess. Of course, mother. Uh, so much to prepare. I can hardly contain myself. So excitable. Dawn... ...you are the most precious thing to me in the whole world. I promise, tonight, when the moon rises, and you have not been pricked. We will celebrate. They say that only true love will break the spell. If I can only hope that the curse never finds it place. To my prince this dove shall fly. And when the moon finally rose on Dawn's sixteenth birthday... ...breaking the curse. There was celebrations throughout the kingdom. Are you ready, my dear? Your party awaits. - I'm a little afraid. - Oh... Don ot be afraid, my love. They're gonna love you, just as we love you. I just can't believe it, I've waited my whole life, now I'm finally free. Yes, you are. You'll never have to wait again. May I have this dance, princess? May I dance? Ask your mother. Of course, you have our permission. Do you know that boy? No, my King. Perhaps he's one of the knightsmen. Perhaps. I have a present for you. You do? That's so very kind. Not here. Come. It's been so very long since I've seen the sky above my head. - I just realized... - What? I've never seen the sky above my head. It's so very... very beautiful. That's not the only thing that is beautiful. My present? Perhaps it's not fit for a princess of your beauty. But I've worked on it for so very long. Go ahead. Open it. I've never seen anything like it. How ever did you make something so beautiful? Promise not to tell? Of course. How could I betray the giver of such a beautiful gift? I made it with this. What is it? It's a spindle. But of course you can't touch it. Have you seen Dawn? She's fine. It is past the full moon, the curse is no more. Humor me, please. One last time. For you, my love, of course. I mean... you're not supposed to touch the spindle. Why not? That silly old spell is no more. I'm past my sixteenth birthday. Let me see! It's harmless. No... You stupid, little girl. I mean, you're not supposed to touch the spindle. The eagerness of youth. Don't you know that once a spell is cast, it cannot be broken? Your impatience and impetuousness has not served you. And as for your dear mother and father, well... I hope they sleep tight tonight. Ohh... Oh, no. This can't be happening. My dearest King and Queen, your child is fast asleep. Get away from her. And soon so shall you be. The moon is full, or so it seems. Only a few days shy of Dawn's sixteenth. I'm sorry that I had to conjure up the inevitable, but I had to make sure that I got my kingdom. And now I shall rule it for many, many years to come. Blast that paltry little nymph! Ah! A thousand curses to you faeries! The curse and the counterspell, now in place, all of Olivetta fell into a deep, deep slumber... ...and the evil Tambria was left alone to rule a sleeping kingdom. My father won't leave me his kingdom, unless I find a wife... and sire an heir. You, come here. - Prince Jayson has displeased the King. - Again. I didn't quite learn my lesson this morning. Oops. Take the prince's punishment, you putrid dog! Again. Oh, stop. Don't whip him like an old woman. Do it like this. He must learn his lesson. I'll take your punishment, but not from you. Sire, the future King should not deal out his own punishment. Fine. I'll have Gruner do it instead. Whip him! As if you were me. Enough! Enough. Barrow, you may leave. And you, tutor. Argh! Wine, I want wine. One of you, get me wine! "If you read this, please do know, "A web of ivy will begin to grow. Along my walls and up my spire, only with a kiss will it retire." Barrow! You're up early. What's that you have there? I.. I found these notes in the nest. Look! They make a map. Indeed. Who do you think wrote it? There can only be one. This can only be the words of the sleeping beauty. Who's that? When princess Dawn of Olivetta was born.. An evil witch put a curse upon her. That by her 16th year.. She would prick her finger and die. Good fairies cast a spell of their own. So that instead of dying, she fell into a deep slumber. And no one can wake her? The legend has it that... ...the people of the kingdom fell into the same deep slumber. No one has gone to that kingdom and returned.. It is place of great evil. And so the legend tells. Where is this kingdom? It's not far from here. Just beyond those mountains. All the people of Lipscomb... ...know of this legend. People say that magic and spells are just for children. She seems so very sad in her notes. Barrow. The prince requires your services. What is this? It's nothing, it's just.. A map... ...of sort sort. - It's just something to fill the time. You don't have enough to do? This seems to have taken up much of your time. This writing, what does it mean? The small little musings of an idle mind, pay no attention. I'll let you know what I pay attention and what I don't pay attention to. I leave you alone for two seconds, and you come running down to the yard like boys. What's this? It's just something I discovered. Something you've discovered. Peter, what does it say? My sleep will end when a prince bestows upon my lips a kiss. And the curse will end, and my kingdom will through that prince shift. Hmm.. What does it mean? It means my lord, that the sleeping beauty, Princess Dawn, will wake, and her kingdom will pass to the prince who has bestowed upon her the true love's kiss. A kingdom? Of my very own. Go away! It is not so easy my lord. There is evil. Those who go to that kingdom do not return. The Dark Queen within the castle walls... ...commands dark forces that protect that sleeping princess and the castle treasure. You speak to me... ...about kingdoms and treasure. And expect me, a prince, to care about an old lady and her unseen forces. Do you think we could take this kingdom? That I could be King of my very own. Anything is possible, my lord. - Gruner. - My lord. Fetch the horses. We're off to get me a kingdom. Yes, my lord. Barrow, you're coming too. My lord, he's just your whipping boy. What help could he be to you? Do you dare to question me? No, my lord. Good. You're coming too. Err, which way into the kingdom? Well, I don't know my liege, I need my map back first. It says here the Evil Queen built a wall around the castle to keep people out. Again with the Evil Queen. A wall is of no concern, we'll just climb over it. You're a good climber, aren't you? Let's take over the castle. If the legend is true, then everyone will be sleeping. It makes perfect sense to me, brother. It says here that if we go near the castle, we're in great danger. Get to the rear, boy. How are we supposed to get across there? What does the map say? It doesn't say anything. Look! A boat. Well, that's strange. Get on with it. It's all far too easy. Come on, Gruner! Don't be such a namby-pamby. What's the matter Gruner? You afraid to get your feet wet? I think he's scared of boats too. I think he's afraid of the water. Judging by the smell of them, I'd say they're all afraid of the water. Come on! Let's move! - Come on, old man. - Thanks. What was that? Oh, we really got him going now. - Do you feel that? - I did. Oh, we probably just ran aground. We should row faster. Whoa, there it is. No, that's just a fish. Do it now! Help! Help me! Keep on guard! Help me! Help, someone help! Make way, make way! Run! Quick, quick, quick! Move! Get off the boat! Come on, man, get out, go. Run! I told you.. ...that it wasn't safe. There's no turning back now. Did you see what happened to Frederick? Did you see it? - You did this! - Shut up! I told you! It wasn't safe! Should've listen to Gruner. My lord, which way now? My lord! Barrow? Follow me. You don't lead, you point. Follow me. We'll keep moving! What was that thing? You can't seriously expect us to go on. Frederick's dead! I told you, it was part of the curse. What say you, Gruner? How do you know of this curse? Why didn't you say anything sooner? My grandfather was a knight. He told my father a story who told me... ...that within the walls of Olivetta, the dead walk while the living sleep. The whole kingdom is besought with a curse. - Why did you not say anything sooner? - I never thought to pay it much attention! What does he mean? It means we're all walking towards our own death. Alright men, let's search for a way in. I wouldn't much want a kingdom like this. Quiet! No one asked you. Ah! My lord.. There's some kind of... force... ...surrounding the castle. We can't get in any of the doors. Or windows. I've never seen anything like this. No one has. This is Tambria's magic. Another warning. We should rest here, my lord. Nonsense. We'll rest once I am inside my castle. Look, there's something there on the walls. What is that? Something unholy. From time to time, many sons of Kings came and tried to force their way through. But they were caught, and there they died a... ...lamentable death. Look, up there. An open window. Well, my lord? Are we going up? I think it would be wise to let the men rest. We'll make a camp over here, tonight. Very well, we'll keep watch. Before that.. We should have Barrow test it out for us. See if he can go up and down, without facing, what was it you said? Ah, yes... ...a lamentable death. As you wish. Hey. This is a bad, bad place. Maybe we should go back. Go back? You mean over the lake? Then we camp. I don't want to stay here. There's been no way out. Look, little brother, we'll be alright. The worst part's over. Inside that castle, there will be unknown riches and treasure. And once we're inside, it'll all be ours. Or we die. What did this lady poet of yours say? The wall is high, you're sure to die. It doesn't look too bad. It'll just be like, climbing a wall back home. A little bit further, Barrow. What can you see? It's just an empty room. Go inside. Secure the rope. We'll all head in tomorrow. No lamentable death today. Okay, heads up. Psst! What are you a girl or a boy? I don't know what you think you are, but my name is Newt. Look, these men are thieves and rapists. You shouldn't be here. And I could say the same for you. This is no place for a heavy-set man, who'd rather drink and lay down women. This is a dangerous place. So we've seen. What are you doing here? What are you a fugitive or thief in your own right? I was sold to a horrible King... ...starved, kicked and out with the dogs. So one day I left. And how did you get in there? I climbed for two days, and now I can't get out. We took the lake. You don't understand, once inside the cursed kingdom of Olivetta, the live don't leave. Yeah, listen.. You're not safe here, you should stick with us. Big, thrashing drunkards on the ground? No thanks. What was that noise? I think it was the kingdom saying we're not welcome. I'll have no such insolence in my ranks. Now go and get the men some food. And at first light, the prince wants to see if there's another way in. A simpler way. Move! Barrow. Yes? The treasure in this castle must be great. For all this bother. Well, she is of course very beautiful, as legend has it. I'm talking about the actual treasure. Not the Princess Day, or whatever her name is. Dawn, my liege. Your future princess's name is Dawn. I know. Don't correct me. What else do you know about her? She's a wonderful writer, has great penmanship. Many people say she's one of the brightest minds in the three kingdoms. Enough. Once she's birthed me a couple of heirs, she won't have time for such silliness. Of course, my liege. Men! Wake up! Up, up! Let's secure the grounds. And then we'll take my castle. We have visitors. Throw open the gates in their honor. Perhaps they would like to meet some of the King and Queen's family. The kingdom is vast, my liege. Well, Barrow? How vast is my kingdom? It doesn't say, my lord. Well, it's bigger than Lipscomb, right? I believe so. What does it say about this bridge? It's not on the map. It's not on the map. Could be a trap. I do not need the opinion of a tutor when I am be King. Okay, yes, your majesty. My lord? They're wasting our time. Barrow. There are things I need to explain to you. A first, you are indeed becoming all that you could be. There is more.. What is that? The undead, my lord. They walk! Run! Go, go! Go! Go, go, go! Go, go, go! Earlin! Come on! Earlin, I'm not leaving him! Earlin, we have to go! We have to go! Come on! - I'll be fine. I'll hide. - I'm not leaving you. To the wall! - You go first. No, you. - No, you first. I'll go first. Wilhelm, Jacob! Protect your future King! Fight, you cowards! Go! - Stop! - Look, we need to go back and save Earlin. He's gone. Get up the wall. Go! Don't look down. What are those things? The dead, my lord. It's the curse. This is all your fault. You showed us the bridge. You were reading the map. So... What do we do now? The whole place is sealed. It's impenetrable. The upstairs is completely blocked, and the undead are down below. If we open that up... ...then we suffer the same fate. The only way out is the way we came in. We need a distraction. Take me up! Pull me up! Wait! They've made it to the castle walls. Do you know these people, Dawn? Wish you'd have done this earlier, brother. You're telling me. My lord? What do we do about him? Leave him. Let him cover us from down there. Help! Let me up! Psstt! What are you doing here? I told not to come to the castle. Look, that doesn't matter. What do I do about these things below? You use the tunnels and the passageways, but you don't want to enter this castle. And where are they? Well above your head. Okay, thank you. You shouldn't thank me for showing the way to your death. Where are you going? You're not coming? I'm not allowing myself with those men. They're too callous. They're going to be slaughtered like cows. Listen, they're soldiers. I wouldn't worry about them. None of that matters. This is Tambria's kingdom. You know her? I know of her, but she knows not of me. I am sure of that. We can't stay here. Then where do we go? We don't have the map. It's with Barrow. Gruner, go and get him. - Let me help you up! - I found a way in. Alert the prince. What's that, bird? They've entered the castle walls, have they? You know, you're lucky we rescued you, Barrow. Did you hear something? I have a bad feeling about this, brother. Men! Tighten up! Stay close! We're surrounded! Stay back. Hit them under the helmet! Good job, men! Is everyone alright? Good job. Move, Barrow! Time to plunder our treasure. And claim my kingdom! Barrow, come. Join us. Well, if they think that they can kill some of my pets, then I'll have to use something stronger. Tread carefully, men. Be cautious. This Queen, she really seems to fancy the decorations of the dead. Barrow, what do you know of this? I suspect more undead. Gruner. Take this. It's true. All the stories are true. Let's go, wench. Fancy a dance? You dance like a dog. Alright, don't worry, darling, this'll only hurt for a moment. Stand down, brother! Wilhelm does it best. - Leave her be! - Watch your tongue! Enough! Once we kill the witch, and I have kissed the princess, you can have all the girls you want, now move! My prince, it's your treasure. My spoils await. It's a trap. Why would Tambria leave this treasure unguarded? We have yet to see this Tambiria, just her monster and her ghouls have been... ...a nuisance. Gruner! She's behind all this evil, my liege. I know. Let me go first. This is my kingdom. Barrow! Go fetch my treasure. Careful, Barrow. Hurry up, Barrow, bring me my treasure. Perhaps it's best if you wrest the castle first-- save the treasure 'til afterwards. - We don't have time for this boy's ineptitude. - He has a point, my lord. The treasure will weigh us down. Why don't we secure the castle, and then... If I wanted your opinion... ...I'd ask for it. Good work, my liege. I'll fetch the treasure myself. Come on! Help me! What was that? - What was what? - I felt something. What? That was it again. Get to the stairs! Wait! The prince! It took the prince! Look, we have to go back! - This was a trap! - We'll be dead if we go looking for him blindly! This is all your fault! You lead us here. You told us to come here! Give me one good reason why I shouldn't kill you right now! Because I've got the map! And forgive me if I'm wrong! But I'm the only one who can read it! Unless you can read! And if you can't, then maybe you should go and save the prince! And the princess! Men, ready your swords! We're going back in! Stay close! Barrow! You take the lead. Okay. Follow me. Okay, this is where he went down. Anyone see anything? Clear. There's nothing over here. Oh, okay. There's a tunnel through here. He must've gone that way. - The prince is dead! - Watch your tongue! That's it. We are not following Barrow anymore. We're leaving. What would your prince say? Huh? He's as good as dead. I took you for soldiers. Not common farm hands scared of legend of lore. That thing is no mere legend. We must leave. Frightened? No. The prince will be angry if we leave. You wouldn't want to be on the end of a beating, now, would you? I'm with you. Good. Follow me. Don't think this raises your position. It came from that direction. - It's one of the undead! - Attack! - Move it! - Wait! Wait! It's fine. It's fine. I know her. Who and what is this little twig? The lot of you are in deeper trouble now. This is Newt. She's one of the only other things living in these hallways. That monster is a conjure of all those evil within Tambria. It knows you are here now. You haven't a chance to make it out of this castle alive. Unless... ...you leave now. Abandon your friend and flee. You know we can't do that. The prince is the only one that can save the princess. Again with the prince. Do you think that monster cares who he eats and rips from limb to limb? He cares not. Save yourselves. We can't. Then may the Heavens be with you. Because you won't make it out of this castle alive. Where did she go? Quick! My grandfather told me of many tales of battles like this. ...Stand firm! Stand firm! I'll be fine... ...I'll be... I'll be fine. I'll be fine. Jacob, Remember, when we were little, I... ...used to pick on you so much. You killed my brother. Let him go. Let's keep moving. You're sitting in the King's throne. And I've just laid out a lovely feast for such an illustrious guest. The Prince of Lipscomb. I knew your great grandfather. Yes, I remember him well. A brute of a man. Not terribly affectionate, though, I suppose that passed down in your lineage. He turned me away when my kingdom was destroyed. Have you ever thought what it might be like? To have a kingdom destroyed? They slit my husband's throat open-- like a pig. And then they burned my children alive... ...in front of me. I wonder what the current King of Lipscomb would think if I sent his son's head back... ...on a stick? I'm sorry if he slighted you. I am sorry... ...if he slighted you. I am not like my father. Or his father before him. You saw what happened back there. - There's no way we can survive this place. - Look, the prince is the only one that can break the curse. It's doubtful that he's still alive. Listen, you can either stay here and be a coward, or we can move forward and fight. It's your call. I'd rather have my brother's life back. I'm sorry for your loss. But we cannot allow your brother's death to be in vain. Come. Jacob. Continue to fight. I can attack them. - You fight well for a whipping boy! - You fight well for a thief! Well done. I just saw my life... flash before my eyes. The undead are using the passageway systems too. I don't wanna be inside the castle anymore. Look, you can stay here, but I'm going this way. Which way? I think it's best if we split up. - I'll go with you. - No. You need to stay with Jacob. Good luck. Gruner! Rot in hell! Newt was right. I don't think we're going to make it out of here alive. I was thinking the same thing. What happened? A cursed journey from the beginning. So what do we do now? Thank you. Think nothing of it. It is no place to hold a man to lower rank. You've done well. Despite the fact that neither of us will make it out alive. We're dead men if we stay here. We're dead already. Just two of us against untold numbers of monsters and the undead? If Newt can do it, if she can survive, then so can we. It is indeed the duty of a knight to never refuse a challenge set by an equal. Do you have an idea? Actually, I do. Are these your men who tortured my minions? I know not. I will take care of this. My liege! - We're here to save you. - Barrow. - Gruner! You're alive! - That we are, for now at least. We'll get you out of here. It doesn't matter how may you kill, there are untold minions. I have infinite armies at my beck and call whenever I so wish. For those who rest, and those who lie, I ask you recent, all thee who have died, rise up again, and walk the Earth. Thank you. You penetrated Olivetta. You broke the gate, unleashing my undead, into the three kingdoms. No. No? See for yourself! Oh. A family reunion of sorts. What is wrong with you? My ghouls will make sure... ...that each and every person will bow down to me. Nowhere, and no one, will be safe. Dawn? Please, don't hurt her, just give her to me. I'll take her far away. You can have your kingdom, just please, give her to me. Prince Jayson, can you hear your friend here? He wants the princess all to himself. He never did know his true position in life. What shall we do with him? Leave him tied up. We'll deal with him once we take care of Dawn. - What happened to you? - Bite your tongue, Barrow. Especially, when you're talking in front of... ...my Queen. What about Dawn? What about your quest for the kingdom? You'll never be a prince, Barrow. You are whipping boy That is all you are... ...and all you will ever be in this kingdom and the next. Why should I have one kingdom when I can have three with Tambria. Besides, my father would never bequeath me his kingdom. So I've decided to do things my way. This is my way. Can we get on with this, please? And kill her? I need to see how deep your loyalty lies. Which one of your friends would you like to kill first? I would suggest you kill whipping boy, Barron. What evil has she perpetrated on the prince? Believe me, I think it's been always his nature. We'll never get out of here, especially not in time to save the princess. Newt? Oh, thank heavens! You shouldn't say that, you're still as good as dead. The good news is, the princess isn't... yet. - Do you know the princess? - Of course, how would I not? - Could you take us to her? - To take you to your death? I suppose it, if you like. I think she's up ahead this way. What do you mean, you don't know where she is? I've never been this way before. Run! Alright, you stay back. You betrayed me. That was just to save myself. Didn't seem like it. What was I supposed to do? Throw myself on my sword as a sacrifice? Tambria was going to kill me. That doesn't sound like a bad idea! Good men have died underneath your honor, and now you switch allegiances? You are a coward. - You betrayed Dawn. - I was never gonna kill Dawn. - How can I trust you? - You have to. Barrow. I am sorry. There was no... other way. You still need to kiss the princess. And kill Tambria. I'll be your back up. No. You should save yourself. Here. Take this. This is my crest. You should go somewhere where no one knows you as a whipping boy. When my father took your father's kingdom, he took away your birthright. I'm giving it back. At least I can face this like a man. You've returned. Perhaps you're more of a man than I thought. Perhaps I am. If I'm to spend an eternity with someone, I need to know that they're going to be by my side. You don't get anything until you kill Dawn. You see my armies are out there conquering, and I can't enjoy it... ...because I'm stuck in here. I need you to kill her. - Oh, she's... - Beautiful? Is that what you were gonna say? She's also about to be very dead. Of course. - I just didn't realize... - Stop gawking! I need you to kill her. Why me? I've tried to kill her a thousand times, but every time I get close, I get pulled back. It's part of the little fairy's curse. Oh, look how sweet! You're trying to wake her with a kiss, but don't you know that only a prince with a pure heart can do that? - Wake up! - And it's obvious which one you are. Oh, it's so hard to try and be a man, and you were so close. You'll never get away with this. How do you know what I'm capable of? Bring me the bald one. I want to play with his head. Psst! - Newt? You're still alive! - Of course! I am here to lead you to the princess. Let's go. If you kill the princess, you will have your own kingdom, not a very big kingdom, but a kingdom nonetheless, and I will be eternally grateful. What would you have me do? Just stab her through her heart. I don't want to take any chances. And you'll have whatever your heart desires. What if I don't? Then I will rip your head off. Why can't any of you just kill her? - Get back! - Huh, you think you can challenge me? You've got nothing against me. You think you're gonna save the princess? I've got a gift for you. "Hand of evil, hand of fate, those just killed, regenerate!" They were cruel to you when they were alive, it will be interesting to see how they treat you now. What have you done? My liege, listen to me. I know there is good in your heart. Please, just, listen within! You think he's got good in his heart? Hm, looks pretty heartless to me. What do you think? Do you have love in your heart? What do you think? I think not! - I feel sorry for you. - Sorry for me? You're sad. I can see it in your eyes. For the rest of your life, you will never understand true love. Are you still hungry? Eat, eat. Finish him off! Earlin, oh, thank God you're alive. I never thought I'd see you again. Tambria! I am not done with you! I've defeated your dead, your wraiths, your monsters! Not all of them. There. It's done! Release them. Very well. Be gone. I surrender. I cannot carry this weight any longer. I have nothing left-- princess is yours. Awaken her. Love does conquer all. Look out! You liar! He's dead. You said that love conquers all. And child, it has. But I stand with the blood of my people. All that has perished at the hands of the vile and the cruel. Rise up from the depths of the tomb! And walk this place! Serve my power, avenge my blood and give me grace! Avenge my blood! Newt! If you don't pick up that sword and stab that sleeping beauty in the heart, Barrow will eat you! Come, come, all of you. Go to her. Go to her. No! No! Oh, you poor creature. You... you kissed me. Thank you. If you think that you can ruin, this glorious future that I have conjured up these last hundred years... But since you are not asleep anymore, then I can kill you. Stay back! That is no way to speak to my princess. Tambria, you are no longer welcome here. Leave. Queen Tambria, you are henceforth banished from my kingdom. It is my kingdom! It's harmless. You might want to come in, my lady, the party is about to begin. One moment. I was just thinking of things long ago. Lords and ladies, the princess Dawn. I remember the story of a day much like this. - I was so young. - You still are. - I'm a hundred years your senior. - Hmm, give or take. - Are you ready? - I can hardly contain myself. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for coming to the celebration of the birth of our first daughter, Day. Come, bestow your blessings upon her. May you always be fair. And they lived happily ever after... ...or perhaps not. I would like to bestow a gift upon the child.
