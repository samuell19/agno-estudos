[ Sniffs ] [ Humming ] Yep, I'm training so someday, I can pull Santa's sleigh. [ Sniffing ] And that's why I'm not gonna eat any of those delicious Christmas cookies. Ah, you can always tell when it's almost Christmas. [ Grunting ] Ahh! But, I'm talking about the other signs of Christmas. Decorations... [ Sleigh bells jingling ] The sounds... Hey, fellows. One sound at Christmas I really love, is music. Christmas Carols being sung by a choir. ♪ We wish you a merry Christmas ♪ ♪ we wish you a merry Christmas ♪ ♪ we wish you a merry Christmas ♪ ♪ and a happy new year ahh, beautiful.

Uh-oh. I was, uh... Just uh, fueling up for some more training. Yeah. I remembered what I was gonna tell you. How the Christmas Carol came to be. Huh? Hey! This most beloved of holiday traditions got its start in the little town of Harmony. A nice little town... Full of nice people. Merry Christmas.And a merry Christmas to you. And a happy new year. And happy new year to you as well. Have a festive time. Happy holidays. The thing was, even though the place was called Harmony, the one thing it didn't have, was music. Now, it hadn't always been like that. A long time ago, they sang and played just like anyplace else. But Harmony... Well, it was just a little town. A folks had to work just a little bit harder to keep up with the bigger towns. Bakers baked faster. Salesmen sold harder. [ Bell rings ] Butchers cut the meat just a little thinner. By and by, nobody had any time left for life's little pleasures, like music. Of course they still had time for Christmas. And come December, the folks of Harmony were even busier making presents for each other. But somehow, without the music, Christmas just didn't have quite the same feeling. There was something missing. Thank you, sir. Maybe you'd call it, the Christmas spirit. Merry Christmas, ma'am. Merry Christmas to you. Merry Christmas. And a happy new year. Now when they were making gifts, the people of Harmony never forgot Mr. Ryan's orphanage. Good morning, kids. It was a good thing, too. 'Cause old man Ryan never thought much about Christmas at all. Yes, what is it? Good morning, Mr. Ryan. We just want to wish you a merry Christmas, and a happy new year. Oh. Yes, yes. Thanks so much. Good bye. [ Door slams ] Well, merry Christmas. In fact, if you asked any of the kids who lived at the orphanage, they'd tell you what Mr. Ryan mainly thought about, was chores. Kimmy, help Bobby, will you? Be careful with that lamp. Are you done? Mm-hmm. Okay, okay. Mr. Ryan certainly believed in the virtue of hard work. Arron, you missed a spot. Elizabeth, use a circular motion when you Polish. Chester, you're dawdling. Ted? Now, the three hardest working kids at the orphanage, were Ted... Cindy and Ollie. They were great friends. They had known each other since they were babies. And they made a great team. [ Laughing ] Hey, cut that out. [ Laughs ] Mr. Ryan: Ted! Oops. Here Cindy take this. Yes, Mr. Ryan? Put these somewhere, will you? Yes, sir. Oh. Oh. Mr. Ryan? Yes? What is it? When we're finished cleaning up the kitchen, may we put up the Christmas decorations? If it's okay? Well, I suppose so. If you leave yourselves enough time to clean up the attic. Yippee! Oh! I mean thanks, Mr. Ryan. [ Chuckles ] Oh, no, no, no! Circular motions. Here, I'll come and show you. Let me help you off that broomstick. Hey, Cindy, Ollie... [ Shattering ] Oops, sorry. What is it, Ted? Mr. Ryan says we can put up the Christmas decorations. Really? Great. That's swell. Ted: Let's go! Come on! Come everybody. We're gonna put up the Christmas decorations. [ Cheering ] I cannot wait. Let's go. [ Laughing ] Funny thing... But of all the people in Harmony, the ones with the most Christmas spirit, were the kids in Ryan's orphanage. Even though they didn't have much else. [ Laughing ] Well, there it is. It looks a little worse each year, doesn't it? [ Knocking ] I'll get it. Here you go, kid. We wish you a merry Christmas. Thanks. Oh, and a happy new year. Hey, guys. Look what we got. It looks better with more presents under it. I wonder what all this stuff is? Maybe they're toys. Or new shoes. Or quite possibly a fruitcake. Mmmm. A fruitcake? Eew! Ted: Hey, let me just see it, Cindy. What's the matter, Ollie ? Aren't you excited about our presents? Yeah, I guess. What's wrong? I don't know. [ Knocking ] We wish you a merry Christmas and a happy new year. Thank you. Merry Christmas. Mommy, why aren't they giving US presents? Well, you see, dear... At the orphanage they have nothing with which to make presents. Oh. Well... Um, merry Christmas. Gosh, now I feel terrible. Yeah. Me, too. That's when Ollie had a great idea. Gosh! That little girl was right. We should give presents. Gee, you think so? Sure. That's what Christmas is all about. Giving. But, we've never given presents before. Yeah. Think how surprised everybody will be! But you heard the lady. We don't have anything to make presents out of. Yeah. So what if we can't make stuff, we'll do stuff. Do stuff? What do you mean? You'll see. Grab your coats. Where's he taking US? I'm not sure. So the orphanage kids set out to prove that they had as much Christmas spirit as anyone. Huh? What does this have to do with where Christmas Carols come from? You'll see. You now, listening to a story is like waiting to open your Christmas presents. You have to be patient. And sooner or later, your Patience will be rewarded. Now we all know, that the kids at Ryan's orphanage didn't have much. But they still wanted to show the people of Harmony that they could give as well as receive. [ Hollering ] Whew, that was a close one. Of course, up here, we love the idea of giving. And Ollie had hit upon a wonderful way to share the Christmas spirit with the rest of the town. Hey, get off the table, will you? Can't you see we're busy? Oops, sorry fellows. See, Ollie figured if there was one thing the kids of Ryan's orphanage knew how to do, it was work. So the first thing they tried was shoveling their neighbors walks. Hey did a great job. Well, we're done. [ Wind howls ] Unfortunately, the weather didn't cooperate. Well, as long as they had all that snow, they decided to dress up town square with a good old fashioned snowman. [ Kids laughing ] The problem was... They'd never built a snowman before. There, that'll do. But, something's not quite right. Yeah. It looks a little... Top-heavy. Ted: Look out! [ Laughing ] Ollie: Ted, you crack me up. But the kids refused to give up. They even tried to decorate main street. Whoa! Ouch! Ted, watch out. Sorry, Ollie. I'm trying to do my best. Easy now. Easy... But they just weren't quite... Tall enough. Although it just about broke their little hearts. The kids finally had to give up and head home. After all, they still had to clean the attic. And I don't have to tell you that Ollie, Ted and Cindy were not the sort to leave a chore undone. [ Laughing ] That tickles. Come on, guys. Stop clowning around. We're almost done. Hey, Ollie... Look at this. Oooh... Neat. Look at all those sleeping ants. Cindy: Those aren't ants. It's some kind of writing. Let me see. What's that? Beats me. [ Notes chime ] Ooh, that sounds neat. Yeah. But it doesn't help clean up the attic. Wow. Don't look now... But I think we're finished. Great! Now we can get back to work on the Christmas presents. Well, nice work, kids. Looks much better up here. Thanks, Mr. Ryan. Now it's time to wash up and get to bed. But, but-- Mr. Ryan... We sort of had a project we were working on... We were kind of hoping we could stay up and finish it. I'm sorry, Ollie. But not tonight. You kids need your sleep. Besides, it's Christmas Eve. Good night. But, but-- [ Sighs ] Bedtime on Christmas Eve? Gosh, you know what that means? Yeah, we don't have time to find a present. I guess we might as well forget the whole idea. [ Playing notes ] Cindy! Sorry. I still wish there was some way we could give people presents this year. Yeah, but how? I don't know. If there's anyone that can help US out, it's Santa claus. He knows everything there is to know about presents. I bet he can figure it out. Yeah. I bet he could. Gee, do you think? Sure. But, it's Christmas Eve, and I know he's really, really busy tonight. I wish he could help US. Well, Ollie was right of course. Christmas Eve is Santa's busiest night of the year. But the magic of a Christmas wish is powerful indeed. And despite all the hubbub, Ollie's wish was heard. ♪ Deck the halls with boughs of Holly ♪ ♪ fa-la la-la la ♪ la-la-la-la oh, lovely. Now, that is a beautiful tree. [ Singing ] I still wish Santa could help US. Oh, my goodness. The poor dears. I believe they need some help. Now, if there's one person who knows a wish when she hears it, it's Mrs. Claus. And she's not one to let a wish go unanswered. Especially on Christmas Eve. [ Wind howls ] Ho, ho, ho. Okay... That's all the east coast toys. Bring on the midwest. Santa? Oh, good news, dear. I'm not taking any lumps of coal this year. All the kids were good. That's wonderful, dear. Listen, I have an errand to run. And I'll be back in a while. What? But, buttercup... You can't go. It's Christmas Eve. All the more reason, dear. All the more reason. Well, do you need to use the sleigh? Thank you, dear. I won't be long. Bye-bye. [ Sleigh bells jingle ] She'll be back in plenty of time. Won't she? [ Squawking ] Huh? Aah! I can't believe we couldn't figure out a present to give. Yeah. I know. Well, maybe next year. [ Playing notes ] Cindy, come on. Sorry, I was just trying to cheer you guys up. [ Knocking ] [ Gasps ] I wonder who that could be? Merry Christmas, children. [ Together ] Merry Christmas. This is for you. Thanks, lady, but... We don't have anything we can give you in return. Oh, that's okay, dear. I'd be grateful if I could just come inside and warm myself by your fire for a minute. I mean, if it's okay. Um, okay. Come on in. Why, thank you. Oh, my, my. Isn't this cozy? And so clean. Oh, that's on account of the circular motion. Very true. Now, are you children having a wonderful holiday? It's okay, I guess. You guess? Where's your Christmas spirit? Well, we have sort of a problem. [ Laughing ] Oh, I see. You can't decide what kind of present to give. Well, yeah. How did you know? Believe me, dear. It's a very common problem. People run around trying to find the perfect present. Some folks get so caught up in trying to outdo each other, that they just forget what Christmas is all about. We're not trying to outdo anybody. Yeah. We just want to give people something, that's all. The trouble is, we can't find anything to give. Umm... Maybe you're looking in the wrong places. We looked everywhere. Did you look in your hearts? Huh? I mean... Excuse me? What I mean, dear, is that the best gifts of all come from within you. A gift could be a wish. [ Chuckles ] Or a smile. Or a hug.

[Playing notes to "we wish you a merry Christmas"] Cindy... Shhh! Sorry. Oh, don't be. That's a lovely song. Where did you hear it? I just sort of made it up. You mean you heard it in your heart? I guess I did. Could you play some more? [ Continues playing "we wish you a merry Christmas"] Oh, that's wonderful. Does it have lyrics? Lyrics? What's that? [ Laughs ] Lyrics are words, dear. A song that lovely should have words. Gosh, I don't know. I just kind of thought it up. What kind of words should it have? Hmm... Well... What's in your heart you'd like to say? Well, we'd like to wish everyone a merry Christmas. And a happy new year. Wonderful. Wonderful. I think you found it. [ Clock chimes ] Goodness, it's getting late. I told Santa I'd return the sleigh. What? I said, uh... Tomorrow's busy day. [ Giggles ] This has been lovely, children. Just remember... If you look inside your hearts you'll find the most wonderful Christmas gift imaginable. Good night. Merry Christmas. [ Kids together ] Merry Christmas. Good night. Gee, she never even told US her name. [ Whistling wind ] Whoa! [ Begins to play: "We wish you a merry Christmas"] Shhh! Keep it down, will you? I'm trying to look within my heart. [ Laughs ] That's not what she meant, silly. Ollie: We wish you a merry Christmas. Wow. Ollie, say that again.

What's going on here ? [ Gasps ] Didn't I tell you kids to get to bed? What are you doing down here? We're sorry, Mr. Ryan. We were just uh... Writing a song. A song? Yeah! Cindy wrote it. Play it for him, Cindy. Very well if you must. Then straight to bed. ♪ We wish you a merry Christmas ♪ ♪ we wish you a merry Christmas ♪ ♪ we wish you a merry Christmas ♪ ♪ and a happy new year.

Maybe if we, um... Well, we're not quite sure. Yeah. I don't guess we can. Well then, run along to bed. You've got a big day tomorrow. Come on, come on. Scoot. Scoot. Ted: Jeepers. Ah, what a day.

Good night. [ Door opens ] Kids, wake up! Wake up! What is it? Your Christmas gift. I think I know how we could deliver it! [ Kids cheering ] So Mr. Ryan and the kids began to put together their Christmas gift to the people of Harmony. A gift that began with Ollie's simple wish, to give as well as to receive. Hey, Ollie, how do I look? Swell! [ Kids cheering & laughing ] [ Playing notes ] Here, Ted. Help me out here, will you? This is gonna be fun. Are you ready? I sure am! Okay, okay. Timmy... Timmy, circular motions. Yep, good. Oh, Cindy? Yes, sir. Here you go. Hey, there's a new part. I know. I thought, um... Well, I thought it needed something in the middle, so I wrote it. I hope you don't mind. No. I love it. Okay, okay. All right, children, listen up. Shorter ones on the chairs, please. Taller ones in front. Let's go. All right, kids. Let's hear a few voices. Cindy, hit a note on the xylophone, then sing it. ♪ La very good. Ollie. [ Clears throat ] Hm-hmm. ♪ La excellent. Ted. [ Strongly ] ♪ la wow... Amazing. All right, everyone, let's try it. Excuse me. Mr. Ryan? Yes, Ollie? How did you learn so much about music? And how come you're going through all this trouble for a Christmas gift? I'll tell you, Ollie. When I first started working here, I taught music. And then when I got to be in charge of the place, I guess I just got too busy to remember what a wonderful part of life music can be. When I heard Cindy's song, I realized how much I missed it. Music gets inside your heart. And never quite goes away. That's what the lady said. Our gift should come from... Inside our hearts. What lady? Never mind. Well, let's give this a try, shall we, kids? Cindy you lead US in. Now... A one, and a two, and a three.
