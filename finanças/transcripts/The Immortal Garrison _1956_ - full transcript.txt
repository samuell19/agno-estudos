IMMORTAL GARRISON Glory of the Brest Fortress the 22nd of June to the 20th of July, 1941 This story is dedicated to the memory of the dead. They cannot rise, not rise from the earth. But, let in our memory, their feat will be resurrected. Their eyewitnesses are in these walls and these forts. These ruins of Brest, this land is near the border where from the first hour of the war surrounded and cut off, people fought to their last sigh, in the name of the distant, incredibly distant victory. This story began on the 22nd of June, 1941. But, we don't start with it first, but from the last page, when finally this flag was hoisted over the fascist Reichstag. I report! Today, at dawn, they freed themselves. After the battle, 217 remain alive in the camp, the rest... the rest died in the battle. It means, shoulder your straps now... They rose at dawn. Some lay on the wires. Others walked over their bodies through the wires. Stop it, Belebin, your habit will kill you. Stop it, I say. Still others went to the machines. With their bodies the muzzles were closed. - How is Alexander Matrosov? - What? I say, like Alexander Matrosov. You don't know of his feat. There was one, Sailors. Yes, we don't know of his feat. We don’t know much. Four years in captivity. So it's hard to recognise me... Baturin? I believed that you were killed. And I thought you were killed. And they thought that we all will be killed. And we were not killed. Still alive. Baturin! I am Baturin! Oh, Karp Fomich! Now. Recent fees. He’s treating me like a bride. She shipped 6 shirts, 3 ties. - I'm afraid to go to the resort... - Will you handle it in an hour? It will not cope! To immediately collect two housewives. One is laying out, the other shifts. And you and your dad will go to the Emka train station? And you, will you pick up our Lenochku? I'll take everyone! In an hour I will wait with the car at the gate. - Hello, Comrade Commissar. - Hello, Comrade Kukharkov. Comrade Kukharkov, please fetch the Comrade Regiment Commander with your family before his vacation. Surrounded by his family? - That's right, with his family. Yes, I will not act in any film! What is it suddenly in the window, like in a puppet theatre. Well, you don’t want to play with me. Fine, fine. And it's already done. Hello. Comrade Military Doctor! Ah, Comrade Surgeon! Well, what about you, Battalion Commissar? There is free time. What are you saying? In an hour I’m leaving for the camp. Maybe we’ll sit on a little bench? I'm going now. Hello. Hello Comrade Battalion Commissar! Sit. Go on. Why by yourself? Where is the hairdresser? Yes, he does not trust him, Comrade Battalion Commissar. - Does he trust you? - Trusts. So it looks strange that Gogolev is cutting you. Are you looking for a girl? Yes. That is, no. I am in advance since soon, urgent service to finish. So can’t wait? Only in conscience. I can’t wait, Comrade Commissar. Are you going to the city? Yes, sir. Well, good luck. Enough for you to engage in politics. Better tell me, what do you think: does he love her or not? Who is he? Who is she? Your Gogolev, our Barbara. - Why is he mine? - He serves in your regiment. Good guy. He ends his service in autumn, going to college. And Barbara, too, going to. So what? What kind of matchmaking is stupid? At this time, honestly. Listen, don’t go to camp. You talk to her. I can’t, Sasha, I can’t. There you see, the 2nd battalion is stretched. I'll go out at night. Look how everything is organised there. For you all the time there is, besides his family. A typical phrase from the wife of a political worker, in her 40s of the 20th century. So they will be waiting for you there, Sunday night. But on the border of Sunday there is no. I’ll go and see and on the way back to the border guards, I’ll stop by. It's such time, Sasha. I wonder how else we haven't cancelled the vacations. Baturin twice asked headquarters: "Maybe not go?" So what? They say: "Leave." - There is no order to cancel the vacation. - So what? Barbara! What? I have no time, I'm going to the town. Come here. I again took your perfume? Just a little bit. Did I give you permission to go to the town? - I'm not your soldier. - You're not my soldier, but you’ll be bold, then someone of my soldiers will quit. I will not give permission for the town. - By whom? - By whom? I know by whom. Well go. Well, that's always the case. - Instead of a serious conversation... - And if I like him? And if he tells me it's like myself when I was 20? What's so good about it? Why are you? Nothing. I just thought that two women are collecting, you have a suitcase, quarrelled 3 times, as a result, you threw everything away. And why is it that Kondratyev never quarrels with anyone? - And we are like a volcano... - Oh, Masha, Masha! They quarrel perfectly, and make peace - everything is like ours! - So, too bad. - Why is it bad? Also good. If it wasn't for Lenochku, I would have kissed you now in the middle of the road! Well, your mum was at home now. - Lenka interferes... - Why does she interferes? Well, she doesn’t interfere - so a kiss! And a kiss! Good day, Comrade Major! Uncle Petya, can you with me? Like a father’s will! There is a discussion, soldier. - You see, what a funny mother you have? - I see. This is her mind, but in general she doesn't like when I'm leaving. Understand? Understand. I want to ask you if you can stay with her today, huh? What reluctance? - Reluctance. - Yes, I understand. But, service! Service. Hold on. Alright, goodbye! See, Pyotr Fomich is waiting. Well, once the order is received... Allow me to depart? You may leave! Do you know what I think, Pyotr Fomich? About what? With modern military equipment our fortress is not a fortress. It's just barracks and ... But, they are built solidly. They are solid. Drive to the river. It's 500 metres to the Germans! And what a silence? With such a silence there is not even a soul here. Yes, none in this place. Where will you rather be: at the camp or the fortress? In the camp. You know, for us, nothing is left with you in the fortress. Come on! Once a vacation ticket is in the pocket, you have to go. What are you sighing? Barbara got married. - To whom? - To Gogolev. He ends his service in the autumn. He offers his hand and a heart. Look, if he isn't leaving! A boy battle. Okay. - Go. - Go. Pyotr Fomich, may I not have to go, huh? Well, why are you silent? Yes, I’m all thinking of Barbara. This love is out of time. Love is always on time, Pyotr Fomich. Well, Pyotr Fomich, - Goodbye. - Take care! Forget about the regiment. - Have a rest. - I'm listening. To Captain Kudinov. You have silence here, Comrade Kudinov. Hmm, yes silence. Shack! But outfits are all the same, send reinforcement. Another night is gone... Night, count! This is our service. - Baturin left? - He left. Your fish are biting at dawn? They bite. I was thinking, what are you doing without gear? Military tricks. Your spin, my spinners... Outpost! Get your rifles! Grenades! Out, Korotkin. They fired at the tiny outpost with guns, mortars, tanks. The outpost was bombed from the air. The border guards fought like heroes. Well, what happened to you? How did they take you? Failed consciousness, lost it like a college student. I couldn’t shoot myself either. - Can you swim? - No. - Can you swim? - Well. Behind me. Tell the others. Behind me! They shot. I swam wounded in the shoulder. Then they stopped shooting. It was about 10 p.m. One day after how did you get from there. But I didn't leave. God knows you are sorry for the expression "promised a reservation and don't get it." Then you say: "I’ll settle without reservation." - You are not satisfied! - Tomorrow will be fine! You won’t have a tomorrow! As punishment I leave my suitcase with you until tomorrow. As punishment? You'll get a soft ride! Agreed. So, you know, you’re standing near the train station the whole day until one hires you. But gentlemen, officers... Oh! Please forgive me, fellow officers don't like to ride in carriages. - Excuse me, please. - Why should I excuse you? We are a working people. Here, under Pan Pilsudski, and under Richsmagel, you, of course, have heard this name. From then officers loved to ride. They climbed into my carriage drunk, cursing... Ah, but! Forward! You know, I was talking with the guys yesterday. They say: "You finish soon while we’ll blow another two years!" And I suddenly became uncomfortable. Why is it inconvenient? When you’re standing guard on Tirespolskaya tower, you can see how the Nazis move around. Here you stand and they walk and walk... Well, let them go. Varvara Petrovna. Varvara Petrovna! Would let the guy go. Anyway, if you run now, you'll be about 5 minutes late to the roll-call. Would you regret it? You, Gogolev, I wish you good luck and haven't seen anything. Varvara Petrovna, hop in. You, Varvara Petrovna, your father ordered me to take you home. I’ve been driving around the town for an hour looking for you. Okay. Don’t be mad at me. And don't be angry with your soldier. But get angry with yourself. Why is this for yourself? What do you want? Why would he refuse to obey me? It is already because of you the leave-time is delayed. You will be a bad wife. We will see about that. Come on! There is no need to look back. Look ahead! - And what's there? - A life! - What? - Yours. Take it easy, your hands are heavy for this case. However, be more careful. And you need to know everything necessary. This I approve. Well, turn off the radio. Zuev. I recognise it with my eyes closed. - Yes, yes! Comrade Sergeant. Company Sergeant Merzoyan reports for duty. Soldier Gogolev is late from his leave. This will not happen again, Comrade Sergeant. So late again? The other Sergeants of the same age, with the same education are eaten. Eating, huh? Eating? It happens, Comrade Sergeant. I don’t eat! I think, as an educated person, you must understand. And you may use my kindness. Will you use or not? Answer, what are you staring at? I'll use it, Comrade Sergeant. Ooh! And you are not ashamed? I am ashamed. Then go and sleep. Not up to par. How is he on duty? Everything is in order, Comrade Sergeant. Have you read his file? I read a bit. Did you read it? - No, I didn’t read it. - Well, go and read it. Thank you. So, for today he is Komsomol, and in autumn he will pass exams to a political school. And he will be a political instructor. - And I'm like a sergeant. - So I will be sergeant. Oldest senior in the whole division. However, I’m used to it. Will you stay on the emergency? I’ll go to MTS as a mechanic. Well, what kind of mechanic are you? - I will learn. - And in more detail? - I will learn. - That's why I love you, Demin, you are talkative. - Attention! - At ease! I came to you in the light. You are free! Already have a leave permit in your pocket but your soul cannot leave. Comrade Major, allow me to address the Red Army Demin. Permitted. Comrade Demin, you can go. - He knows the service. - Yes, he knows! - Something you get in the fog. - The paper is bad. - Bad? - Yes. Well, what about in the barracks? Everything is fine? The soldiers are sleeping, and the guards are on. - Is it coming? - It’s coming. - Well, let's go see how it goes. - Come on. - Fed. Fed. - Well, what is it Merzoyan nevertheless reported. What else was he to do? His duty. A major came and showed him the duty notes. A... a... e .. What? There will be nothing to him. The major met me today with Varya, he found us near the town garden. So what? He said: "Consider my happiness for your, and I didn’t see you." Well, what about Varya? She looked at me like I could couldn't handle the major and turn around and leave. - Stupid. - Who? Yes, all of them. He gave his consent? Well, congratulations! - Comrade Regiment Commander! - Ts-s. The company is sleeping and there are no incidents. Come along. The soldier is sleeping, and the guards are on duty. The soldiers are sleeping. Good night. Well. Soon you will leave for the holiday camp. Good. Good night. Good night, Comrade Major. Hello to the newly-weds. Sitting down and having a good time? Why not or else we hadn't get married? Right! Citizen! They say your husband has left? What kind of nonsense? It's I! - Vanya! Would you let me come in? - I open now. Go away. You might get killed! Or maybe it is only manoeuvres? Yes, we're running out now, we’ll have some tea. The first Soviet officer who meets us in this fortress. - Are you the translator? - Yes, sir. Announce on the radio: "All of you who are hiding, come out and surrender." Follow me! Forward! Follow me, lad, follow me. Hooray! They are driving back the Germans! Chasing them! Back! Back! Grenade! Comrade Military Doctor. - All wounded are in the basement. - Tishkin! Run to the western barracks. If you don't find any seniors, you yourself, will be the leader. - Send the liaisons. - Will do! - Well, what, Kopotkov, - Hot? - It's Hot. Our command post will be here. Put yourself in order and report on the availability of people. There is a report on the availability of people. We fought back the first attack. What a provocation they did, scum! Fascists. This means war, not a provocation. Wipe your face, you have blood on your cheek. - Alien. - That's exactly, feels strange. If it hadn't been for Gogolev, the tank would have made a cake out of me. They were killed. Tell me please. He wanted to be appointed as the chief of staff. Gogolev, follow me. Alexandra Petrovna. Take two soldiers and while it is quiet, go to the command staff hostel. Gather women, children and bring them here to the basement. I can't fetch the women! I still have not treated the wounded. Let the soldiers go. You're right. Go and dress the wounds. Bugorok! Tell the women and the children to accompany you and bring food, beds, etc. Let them consider what can bring. You’ll have to be here in the morning. - Comrade Major. - What? - You and Bugorok go. - I'm listening! Why until the morning? And ours? Now our entire division i in the camp. They are probably already coming here. Pyotr Fomich, everything is there. That's it, everyone must come here! That applies to the whole fortress, the commanders, political workers, all together - five. Women comrades! All of you are ordered, to immediately bring everything from here to the barracks. Pack your bags fast! How is Ivan Stepanovich? Nothing? Not injured? There is fire from the church. Missed them there, missed! Shoot in long bursts until the women have passed. To a meeting. Come on! Let's go! I'll get there myself! Quickly! Help out! Calm, calm comrades. Stay calm. Yes. They were a family and now no family. Vanya. Mum is hurt. - How did she get there? - What else can you say? Nothing. I wanted to help. Alexandra Petrovna, to to the wounded. - Only if you tell me... - Once said, go and help. Good, Van. But tell me one thing. Where is our division? Where is everyone... Masha. I have already said. I took up the wounded. Well, follow them. Listen up! Commissar! Who are you? What? Are you alone of the political workers? - You see the church. - Yes. It controls the entire parade ground. If reinforcement doesn’t arrive to night, we don't have enough strength. It will be hard to keep the fortress. Cannot be. They will come and help out. Help out or not help out. You select people and before it's too late the Germans took the church. - How many did they take? - The took 18. - Did we have any casualties? - Yes, Comrade Commissar. Like 42 casualties, of which 20 are departed. I marked them with crosses. That's it, crosses. Not departed, but killed. Everything you have is pre-war. Well, help me to get up. Well, now you can see where we are taking a beating. All the fire is now directed on the northern island. 12 o'clock. And I thought it was evening already. Comrade Commissar. Down there, the post with the speaker that stood at the club, has been destroyed. - Something is being said on the radio. - Heck. Go and listen. Wait. Do you have a pencil? It may be something important about the general situation! No pencil. - No pencil, Comrade Commissar. - Here. Damn, okay, nibble. So we fought off the first day. And on the second day, at dawn, somehow, a border guard miraculously made his way to us in the citadel. He said that you... Means dead Commissar... Have you seen? I saw. I swam and as the bridge shook I dived under the water and all... It means the Germans occupy the ground? Yes, in Brest. And you think the German's attack was sudden. Miraculously, Comrade Major. Well, if we manage to get out from here at once, and through the German line, that would also be a miracle, huh? And it won’t work miraculously, Comrade Major. - Why? - We are encircled. Tanks, guns. In three rings. Our outpost was blown out. - I don’t want to live. - Well, you drop it! Have to quit. Go and dry up, then take the platoon. - Allow me to leave? - You may. Yes! Wait a moment. It’s not necessary to tell everyone that the regiment commissar died. He has a wife here. - I see? - I see. Go ahead. Van. What? Mum is calling you. I think she is dying. How is it mum? Mamma! - I let you down. - It's nothing mum. My wound is fatal, Vanya. And I thought - so, hit. Ours do not go? Until they go, mum. - So you go yourself. - What? - Make your way, otherwise... - Let's get through, mum. Let's get through. Papa is sad. Kolka, Lenka... I feel sorry for her. She thought I didn't spare her life. All my life I have always regretted it. What do you say, mama? - I never did think like that. - I thought so. We are with her, Vanya, only here the characters are shown. Why are you silent, Vanya? I'll have to go. I could never imagine that my mother would die here in this basement. Vanya, we are short of water. I know. Maybe we can break through? Still, if you die, it’s not under the stones. In the wild. Die? That's not for long. Let's leave the citadel and kill. Die! And who will kill them? Who will kill the Nazis? For four days the first time our starter... Help us out Kukharkov, I feel he will help us out. Eat, Comrade Major. Well, how is a radio? Demin reported it fixed. Wow, he really fixed it? He said he'll fix it, and he repaired it. We could leave, Comrade Major. Not even an hour... Ah, Demin, Demin! Established connection! You have golden hands. Only the Germans will hear. It reaches 200 kilometres. Is it really anywhere near any of ours? Have Kovel and Perepilsk been captured? Well, that cannot be, Comrade Major. Shift to voice. I will speak in plain text. If ours don’t hear it, let the fascists listen. This is Brest Fortress speaking. This is Brest Fortress speaking. All attacks by the Nazis have been repelled with Hugh losses for them. Our losses are insignificant. Prepare with everything you have for a long defence. We are waiting for orders from the command. I switch to reception, I switch to reception. I would give my life now for a Russian voice. German command appeals to the defenders of the Brest Fortress with the latest ultimatum. For five days you alone have continued this senseless defence. Soviet troops are retreating along the entire front. German troops have occupied the cities: Grodno, Baranovichi, Molodechno. This morning, German troops took the city of Minsk. You are 400 km away from your retreating army. Give up this useless resistance! If you surrender, the German command guarantees you personal integrity and safety. Well, Kukharkov, did you hear any Russian voice? I heard. They guarantee us something about immunity. Yes, I don’t guarantee them. Tonight, it is necessary to send more people to get water. Make a stock. It will be harder further on. You, personally, are in charge of this operation. I have to provide! I'll go, I'm already went yesterday. I walked? Well, you went once, go. Look, just don't brag about it to your mother. Got it? Sure, I get it. This is Brest Fortress speaking. This is Brest Fortress speaking. Desperate to seize the fortress, the Nazis yesterday offered us capitulation. They will not succeed in achieving that. Never! Yes. You cannot refuse courage. If you and the soldiers of your division had shown the same courage, the fortress would have been taken long ago! Take your units overnight. I will call the Luftwaffe again and it will thresh them until evening. But, if you haven’t taken it after what remains of them, I advise you to remove this iron cross. This is Brest Fortress speaking. This is Brest Fortress speaking. We are conducting defensive battles. We are waiting for orders from the command. We are waiting for orders from the command. - We are waiting for orders from the command. - The food is gone. Now you can report. They drained the water. 12 buckets. What are the losses? Three wounded. Not to mention... and three killed. - Who! - Butarovich, Vasiliev from art of a platoon... - You know? - I know. Your Kolya. Demin. Go to the hospital... call my wife. Two items on the agenda of our party meeting. About the situation and admission to the party. On the first item, comrade Baturin has the word. Comrades. Unfortunately, the commissar is injured in his leg. But, I myself went to him during the night and I will speak for both of us. For seven days we have uphold the defence of our fortress. We have no doubt that our army will defeat the Nazis. But, here the the Germans broke through. Therefore, the facts are staring right through our eyes. Retaliation by our army will not happen today, nor tomorrow. Under these circumstances, we have two options: to try to break out of the fortresses in small groups, or fight here to the last bullet, inflicting maximum losses to the enemy. What do the Communists think about this? Comrade Rostishkin. As a representative of the western barracks, on behalf of four Communists and all soldiers, I have a proposal to fight here in the fortress. Machine gunners! We are having a conversation! Allow me! You are welcome, Comrade Merzoyan. On behalf of the Communists defending the church, we are ready to fulfil any commanded order. This is clear to me. But, the command wants to know your opinion. To break out or to fight here in the fortress. We have this opinion Comrade Major, If you give your life as one for ten. It is possible here in the fortress. And there it is impossible. Any other opinion? Fight! Fight! You say yes. But what about women? One has been killed. Two died from wounds. The children are exhausted. What do you propose, Comrade Surgeon? I suggest that if, within the next 2-3 days, help hasn't arrived, send the women and the children. Let them take the white flag and get captured. - Captured? - Yes, captured. We, ourselves, can die 10 times, but we must save the lives of the women and the children. What will you say, Comrade Major? Question about women and children, as you suggest, we will not decide now. And, the rest comrades, I'm glad the opinion of the Communists coincides with the decision of the command to fight here to the end. - You agree? - Agree. The next question: admission to the party. First statement from Comrade Vasiliev. He's writing: "Please accept me as a member of the party. If destroyed by the Nazis, you’ll have to die yourself. I want to die a communist..." Comrade Vasiliev died as a communist when fetching water. There is a suggestion to take him into the ranks of the All-Union Communist Party. Those "For" - raise their hands. Please omit. Comrade Vasiliev is posthumously accepted in the party. The second statement is from Comrade Bugorok. There are two recommendations. Mine, personally and Comrade Merzoyan. He's here. Comrade Bugorok, please come to the table. Tell the story. I am, - Fedor Arkhipovich Bugorok... - To the meeting, to the meeting. I, Fedor Arkhipovich Bugorok, born in the city of Kolomna on the 25th of October according to the old calendar, 7th of November to the new, 1917. My father, Kolomensky, a locksmith at a steam train-building plant. a party member of the Leninist draft... Comrade Major! Aeroplanes are approaching the fortress. - How many? - The floor of the sky. Due to air raid, continuation of the meeting is postponed. To you positions! Hello! - Commissar! - Ivan Stepanych! Great you turned around! - What about you? - In the same vein. Yesterday we took some documents. It turns out that we keep a whole German division with us. Even at heart, it becomes more joyful. - And I am one of those they took the prisoner. - I know. I barely got out. Everything was shot through. Here, I was afraid of this. I asked you instead of the killed orderly. Unfortunately, it will be plenty to do. That's it little sister. The wounded soldiers are tormented there in the basement. A splinter in his stomach. And to live - does not live. And to die - does not die. - Go, go to him. - Good. Well, come on you prisoner. Sorokin! A prisoner. Speak, fascist. I am not a fascist. I am a Socialdemocrat. I gave up myself. What did you do? If I wouldn’t raise my hand they would kill. Let's repeat what you told me. Tractor factory in Stalingrad, a foreign specialist. Mechanic, 3 years. Comrades. I don't want Hitler. I don't want a war! How so? I don’t want, but are you fighting? I don’t want, I can’t, but I had to... I don’t want, I can’t... But I, too I want to believe you, but I can’t. And I can shoot you, but I don’t want to. - What if you’re not lying? - No, it's correct! And here, yours will go on the attack... If I give you a rifle, will you shoot at them? No. I don't know, I just wanted to say... Tonight our regiment will make a general assault. I have already mentioned it. General assault? Tell the truth? - It's the truth. - Take him away. Proceed. Evidently, the German's faith is to die together with us. It seems like he was telling the truth about the night assault. - I do believe so. - I do too. Well, I'll go to my position. It’s necessary to prepare. Ivan Stepanovich, what if? Suddenly, they it's only here they broke through, and in the South, is it the other way around? Maybe, somewhere, our troops already are approaching Prague? - They hit here, and we hit there! - Ah? I didn't have time to fight. - You still have time. - Not true. No really. All will be well. A thousand times it will be! So it will be. Like this. And so. Ours will come. We heard artillery this morning. - Is that true? - Yes, true. You will be transferred to a real hospital. You will have an operation. And you will get better. And I will be completely yours. - Do you want? - Want. - I want too. If you weren’t injured, I would be yours now. Who is it? Biryukov. Where are you going? Immediately everywhere. - How are the ours? - Dead in the other world living beats. - What German I took prisoner? - I wanted to save your life and now yours are you... Or doesn’t it hurt from your bullet? Everything is so stupid. Life is stupid, war is stupid, death is stupid. What is it sister? Our brother soldier was sad because with his legs he cannot go? Are you tired? No. How is it up there? Things are good. Now I'll go, I'll just sit for a minute. Come here, girl. Sister! Sister! Take the wounded. They broke in, they will throw grenades now! Help! Now all of you, fast! What are you doing! Comrades... Comrades... Hell. Still not cool. Now they will go again. Merzoyan! Help to remove the tunic. Watch out. Put on my tunic. - What for? - I order you to put it on! Now go down the rope, you’ll get to Baturin, and report that the regiment Commissar Rudenko sent message to Komsomol Merzoyan and senior political officers. We stay here until death, without you with tubercle, we’ll put down some more fascists. And Commissar Baturin is needed there. Go! I can't. Will not go, Comrade Commissar. If you do not obey, I'll shoot you. Shoot! Go, Grisha. Go please. Not a tax collector. - What year are you born? - 1917. Well, then the same age as October revolution. Finally, one more battle with the Nazis! Comrade Major. What do you want? Comrade Major. Senior Political Officer Rudenko. before he died, ordered me to wear his tunic and fulfil his duties. Good. - What about Varya? Was she also killed? - Yes. In the afternoon. Did she die there? And you are alive... here... - Comrade Chief Medical Officer... - Silence. You have nothing to make excuses for. - And you, there is nobody to blame, except... - My daughter is dead. Comrade Military Doctor. I and the Commissar want to know situation with the women and the children. The children will die first. They are already starting to die. We have nothing to treat them with. And tomorrow there will be nothing to drink. Merzoyan. Do you hear, the children are thirsty? Tell the women that or I will die or the children will have water by the morning. - Have you filled the can to the top? - To the top. - Are all the jars filled? - All. Crawl. Here. And that's all? Indeed, two people gave their lives for it! It's just for one day! - Masha, Masha, they brought water. - Where is Baturin? Masha! Where is the major? Ts-s. Hush. First time he has fallen asleep in three days. Ivan Stepanovich. Ivan Stepanovich! Ah. This is you Masha. What? Vanya. Lenochku is dead. Masha. - Don't cry. - I'm not crying. It is you that is crying. Comrade Major. The water that brought is not enough for one day. The children will die and women will go mad seeing their children die. You must order them to raise the white flag so we can get out of the fortress and be captured. I'm telling you this as a doctor. I don't expect we will be rescued. The stories are no good. You are required at least to try. - Save the lives of the women and the children. - You're right. Gather the women and the children, let them drink water first. - Another question. - Do the women want go? - They will go. That is an order. Everyone will go. - With the exception of... - With the exception of the military. I won’t go either. Leave us alone for a moment. Masha. I love you very much. You have to live. You have to go. Masha. You are the strongest the best. You have to go first and persuade everyone. You are my wife. The wife of the commander, Masha. You can’t stay here. If you don’t go, then no one else will want to go. You have to help me. And help them, Masha. I beg you. Hug me, Vanya. Goodbye, Vanya. The German Command requires only one thing from you. - Honest answers. - I told you everything. Even that I’m the wife of the garrison commander, Major Baturin. OK, let it be true even if this hasn't been confirmed by other women. They don't confirm because they want to save me. But I don’t care. I am inclined to believe it's true. But then the rest is not true. You declare that they have food, water and ammunition. And I know for sure that they have neither food, nor water or cartridges. Go and check it out. I speak German. Mr. General asks you: will your husband fight to the end? I hope so. And if we save the lives of the men as well like we saved their women? Mr. General offers you go to the fortress with a white flag. You must confirm that we treated you well and we will also handle those who surrender to us. In agreement, they will raise a white flag on top of the tower. We will wait. In order of numbers, report! First, second, third... 29th, 30th, 31st, 32nd. Comrade Major. As your order, garrison personnel is summoned. - Hello comrades! - Hello. At ease! Friends. The day before yesterday, we pulled women and children out fortresses. For two days now the Germans have not been shooting. They are waiting for us to surrender like the women. But they will soon get tired of waiting. And they will continue their assault. It will be hard for us to keep the barracks. Trying to stock up on water and leave down in the dungeon. Is this an order, Comrade Major? Go with the white flag. Wait a moment. We will always have time for this. Regiment! Attention! Why did you come here? I came to pass on to you the offer from the Germans to surrender. I came to tell you that you shouldn't give up. It would be possible to attack in two hours. Forever in a hurry. The Commander requires confirmation on our verbal report that the fortress has fallen. This is a bet waiting. The commander said that, because of this Brest fortress, our corps have become a laughing stock. Our neighbours are fighting near Smolensk. I wonder what he would say if he knew our actual losses. Send it. Schweiberg! How is it with the fortress? Haven't they raised the white flag yet? Nothing yet, Herr General. Wait. Wait, they seem to be raising. Alexandra Petrovna. Let's take you down. And? Take Masha Baturin. - She can still survive. - Already carried. And the border guard. Not reported. Died. How can I help you? What to do need? Speak up. How did my Varya die? Did you see it? I saw how she helped the wounded. But I didn't see how she died Did she help you with anything? Just a drop? Highly. Good. - Take it. - What for? Take it. It will come in handy. Hard to hold. So Alexandra Petrovna your died. And you? How are you? We? On the last day of the bombing. Merzoyan lost 6 soldiers. He himself perished. But, I got water. A lot of water. For two week. The Germans missed, they didn't think we could fetch water under such bombardment. They gave the last battle on earth. And went underground. And our underground life began. We crawled out in secret during the night. There they were, remember throughout the fortress. We were shooting. And in the afternoon they had us through the walls and radio ceilings shout: - Surrender! - Why don't you give up? And you sit there, underground and think: "Well, that’s strange for them. that we don't give up." And in fact, why do they ask why we don’t give up, huh? Here you are, for example, Comrade Kukharkov, why don't you give up? For what we fought for, we can't give up. All my life I been thinking. No, not for that. ♪ Feel free to go to battle, ♪ ♪ For the power of advice ♪ ♪ And as one die ♪ ♪ In the fight for it. ♪ Why don't you want surrender, Comrade Major? As for me... I am an old soldier. From the age of 15... I have been in uniform and never seen plain cloths. What about you, Comrade Demin. Do you remember when you went to battle? Fields. Masha. Why are your hands so cold. It's nothing. Why did you close your eyes? I am... I remember how you... came behind me.. to the maternity hospital. Masha. Masha. Masha... Unleashed. Let's go on a sortie, Ivan Stepanovich. The time has come. Let's go. Let's take the soul. - I think today is the 29th. - I don't know, all days are mixed up. I'm tired. It doesn't matter if you read it as the 25th. Read? Tell Ivan Stepanovich to read it? I don't want anything. I want one. To know that we, and on this earth and the underground, will not surrender. This is our immortal garrison. Read, and if we don’t surrender, how can the others give up? Army, the other people? It's funny to talk. They will come, read and go on. - When? - I don't know. Ehhh. To live, to see and die again. Damn box! If only I could say two words through you. Demin wanted to fix it, but he couldn't. For the first time in his life, he couldn't. He died. Let's go. I can’t, Comrade Major. My feet are numb. Still, you bastard, interrupted my vertebra yesterday. Take it Comrade Major. From the pocket... The last day of the world was shot. Kuharek. Listen to me. Kuharek. Kukharkov died. Tell me. Tell me... where are ours? Our are where, huh? No, you say: Where are ours, huh? Tell me: where are ours? Which day? What time is it now? Ah? What? - Have you found it? - Okay! Show him to me! Here he is! - Is he identified? - It is established that this is the commander of the 75th Infantry Regiment, Major Baturin. What do you say? He died without regaining consciousness. Not true! If he could throw a grenade, and kill 3 more people then he can regain consciousness. And you answer me for this with your head. I must know why he did not surrender. I have to continue fighting with them further! There was more interesting. 20 interrogations 6 camps, 5 shoots. They can tell the same type of stories. None worse, none better than mine. Report! Major Baturin, freed from captivity and is at your service. Victory! Radio! The end of the war! They shoot everywhere! Surrender! - Victory! Do you hear Baturin? - Victory! - Give me the gun! - Victory! An automatic for the major! You will never believe what we saw. You will never again know that today it's not two hundred, but 900 million people worldwide who live under the banner of socialism. But just for the sake of what could happen they, in the terrible year 1941, did not hesitate to die on the bloodshot fanned with glory immortal land of Brest.
