ARE YOU GONNA TELL US ANOTHER ONE OF YOUR STORIES? - YOU BETTER BELIEVE I AM. [all groan] - THIS IS THE STORY OF A FOOTBALL TEAM. FROM THE BEGINNING, THIS FOOTBALL TEAM HAD HEART AND ABILITY. BUT THERE WAS ONE BIG PROBLEM. THEY DIDN'T BELIEVE... THAT THEY COULD WIN. AND THEN THIS DOG CAME ALONG. AND THIS DOG COULD DO AMAZING THINGS. AND SUDDENLY, THE TEAM STARTED WINNING. BUT THE TRUTH IS... EVEN WITHOUT THE DOG, THEY WERE WINNERS. EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THEM. SO IF YOU BELIEVE THAT A DOG CAN PLAY FOOTBALL, THEN YOU BETTER BELIEVE THAT WE'RE GONNA WIN THIS GAME. ALL RIGHT, NOW, LET'S GET OUT THERE AND GIVE THEM SOME OF THAT RAZZLE DAZZLE! ROUGH. ROUGH! All: ROUGH! ROUGH! ROUGH! ROUGH! ROUGH! ROUGH! ROUGH! ROUGH! ROUGH! ROUGH! ROUGH! ROUGH! ROUGH!

Phil: IT JUST PROVES MY THEORY. Fred: WHAT IS THAT, PHIL? Phil: SCORE MORE POINTS THAN THE OTHER TEAM, AND, BY GOLLY, YOU'RE GONNA WIN! - ALL RIGHT! YEAH! - UH... - RIGHT, GO, GO. [grunting] [whistle blows] - UHH! - UHH! - OOF! [grunting] - RAAAHR! [grunting] [squeaking] [whistle blows] [cheers and applause] - YES! YEAH! - THAT'S GREAT. - POPOV? - UHH! MOTHER? [clanking] AAH!

[muffled shouting] - AHH! [criminals shouting] [tires screech] [indistinct shouting] [cackling] NOW WE'VE GOT HIM. - YOU DID IT! - OH, AH. WHOA. WHAT? STOP! STOP! STOP! STOP! STOP! [shouting] STOP! Both: AAAAH! [thud] - [groans] - [laughing] IT'S OKAY. IT'S OKAY. I'M GLAD TO SEE YOU TOO. WHAT ARE YOU DOING DOWN AT THE DOCKS? DON'T YOU HAVE A GAME TO PLAY? HUH? COME ON. [indistinct police radio chatter] - DO YOU HAVE A PLAN "B"? [metallic crash] - WE ARE RUSSIAN CITIZENS! WE DEMAND YOU TAKE US TO THE RUSSIAN IMBECILE! - IT'S EMBASSY, IMBECILE! [smack] - AAH! - [crying] [cheers and applause] Fred: MARTIN DROPPING BACK. VOSS... OH, IS HE IN THE CLEAR! THERE ISN'T A TIMBERWOLF AROUND FOR 20 YARDS. TOUCHDOWN! LOOKS BAD NOW FOR THE OLD TIMBERWOLVES. [audience groans] OOH, EEH. [cheers and applause] - NOW, COME ON, NOW, FORGET ABOUT THAT. ANCIENT HISTORY. JOSH, JOSH, COME HERE. GET IN HERE. COME HERE. ALL RIGHT. WE'RE GONNA GET THEM WITH A LITTLE DOUBLE TROUBLE. ALL RIGHT? LET'S GO! BUT, COACH, WE'VE NEVER DONE A DOUBLE TROUBLE WITHOUT BUDDY. - WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO IT WITHOUT BUDDY. BUDDY'S NOT HERE. NOW LET'S GO. COME ON, OFFENSE. YOUSE TWOS, ALL RIGHT? LET'S GO! COME ON, NOW, GET OUT THERE! [Buddy barking] [cheers and applause] Fred: LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, LISTEN TO THAT AUDIENCE. THIS IS A SIGHT TO BEHOLD! IT'S AIR BUD! - GOOD BOY. YEAH. YEAH. LET'S GO GET 'EM, BOY. - [gasps] Fred: THE OLD AIR BUD IS BACK IN THE GAME! - YEAH, THIS DISPELS THAT RUMOR, HEH HEH. Fred: WHAT'S THAT, BILL? - WHAT'S WHAT? - BUDDY... WHERE WERE YOU? - PATRICK? Audience, chanting: BUD-DY! BUD-DY! BUD-DY! BUD-DY! BUD-DY! BUD-DY! BUD-DY! BUD-DY! BUD-DY! BUD-DY! BUD-DY! BUD-DY! BUD-DY! - OOH, LIKE I SAID, DOUBLE TROUBLE! Fred: LOOKING FOR THAT BALL.

[cheers and applause] - YEAH! - BUD-DY! BUD-DY! BUD-DY! BUD-DY! BUD-DY! BUD-DY! BUD-DY! [Buddy barks] [cheers and applause] [grunting] - OOF! - WAH! [whistle blows] Fred: OLD AIR BUD HAS SURE PUT THE TIMBER BACK IN THESE TIMBERWOLVES. I'M TELLING YOU, THEY'RE ON A SCORING RAMPAGE NOW! [cheering] - UH, HUH? WHOA! OOF! OOH! [whistle blows] - FIRST DOWN! - OOF! - OOF! Fred: ANOTHER SCORE! Phil: THAT IS JUST AMAZING. Fred: IT'S NEW YEAR'S EVE IN THE END ZONE WITH AIR BUD. - HE'S GOT FLEAS. YOU CAN'T TELL ME HE DOESN'T HAVE FLEAS. - YAY, BUDDY! Fred: AIR BUD HAS CERTAINLY TIGHTENED UP THIS GAME FOR THE TIMBERWOLVES. BUT THEY'RE GONNA NEED ANOTHER TOUCHDOWN IN ORDER TO WIN. AND NOW... THIS COULD BE IT! - BUDDY! Fred: OHH, NO, 184-POUND CRUSHING TACKLE BY TYLER. AND AIR BUD IS DOWN. TEAMMATES RUSHING ONTO THE FIELD NOW, TRAINERS. AIR BUD, WE SEE MOVEMENT. - IT'S ALL RIGHT. DON'T WORRY, I'M ALL RIGHT. GET THE DOG. - EXCUSE ME.
