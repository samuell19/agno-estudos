[MUSIC PLAYING] WOMAN: Are you all right? RICK: Are your parents still together? WOMAN: Yeah, why? RICK: My mother used to see this guy, Frank, who was an Illustrator, not that he'd done anything. But he used to bring me these books, children's book, as gifts. He eventually, uh-- left my mom. Most of them did. Anyway, he-- he brought me this-- this one book and it was the only book that I'd ever begged my mom to read to me. It's called "Ferdinand-- Ferdinand The Bull," and he wrote on the inside, to a very special kid, and then, life's a matador, and then signed, Frank. It's my favorite book. [MUSIC PLAYING] (SINGING) I can't be blind. [MUSIC PLAYING] (SINGING) Let me love you tonight. Hey, hey. Let me-- Sweet, sweet, sweet. Where are my keys? Goodness. Man, I don't have the keys. What? I don't have no keys. I think my buddy, Rick's in here though. [KNOCKING] Rick? Damn, I shouldn't have given mine. I gave my roommate my keys. GIRL: Why? - I gave him-- I should have never gave him-- that's what happened. You know, you give your roommate your keys, and-- Let's go get some-- you don't have any-- Yeah. [KNOCKING] [INAUDIBLE] Come on. What are we going to do now? So um-- do you like to [INAUDIBLE]?? Yeah. Yeah? Yeah. This is where I live. This is, uh-- my place. Yeah. Yeah. I-- I live here all by myself, cause I'm kind of like, um-- the independent type, like Oscar Madison, but before Felix moved in. But I'm not messy. Shit. The keys. I let my friend borrow the keys because he had a guest [INAUDIBLE],, and I didn't get the keys back. You said there was a party. No. [KNOCKING] Rick? Rick? I thought you lived by yourself? No, I know, but my friend is inside. That's why I'm-- Rick? I'm trying to get the keys. He's the one who had to borrow them. He had-- I mean, he had to get something and-- oh, it's a long story. So where is the party at? No, the party's tomorrow. Rick? Oh, man, come on. No. - You know what? - What? - Whatever. - No. No, wait. Wait-- wait a second. Wait. No. Wait, baby. Do you want to go see a movie? GIRL: No, no, no. I just got this place. It's a condo. It's fucking huge. I just bought it. I just use it when I come here to-- come to the city to work. Now, my friends that you're going to meet now, he's a top model and you-- you guys are going to be in love with this guy. You're going to love this guy. Where are my keys? Will you hold this for me? Holy shit. Where the fuck did I leave my keys? Did I give it to one of my friends? Who the hell-- I can't believe this shit. [INAUDIBLE] [KNOCKING] Yo? [WHISTLES] [INAUDIBLE] [KNOCKING] Yo, Rick? It's me, Salvatore, open up. [KNOCKING] [INAUDIBLE] He's probably taking a shit [INAUDIBLE] [KNOCKING] Listen, do me a favor, stay right here, all right, just in case he comes out. - OK. Let me-- let me go talk to your friend for a minute. Yeah, we'll be right back, all right? [MUSIC - MARZ, "DO WHAT YOU DO"] (SINGING) Side to side. Love the way you bump and grind. Slow it down, get in the groove. It feels so good the way you move. [KNOCKING] You have another one? No. [KNOCKING] [MUSIC PLAYING] (SINGING) I love the way you're on top. [KNOCKING] RICK: I got to get the door. [INAUDIBLE] [LAUGHING] Hey, what's up, beautiful? [INTERPOSING VOICES] - Excuse me. - You are beautiful, babe. You are beautiful. Is she [INAUDIBLE] - Excuse me. - Here let her through. This guy's crippled. [INAUDIBLE] Let her through. Now I'll give you my number later, all right, and give me a call. I don't think so We'll talk later. [INAUDIBLE] Look at that girl. [INAUDIBLE] [INTERPOSING VOICES] - Did you see that? Did you see that bitch? Scared the fucking shit out of me. Ricky, you been fucking, huh? Here, pass that shit around to Mike. Mm. Shit. How's your kid. Yeah, he's good, man. He's getting big. He's getting big. Can he-- can he talk or anything. Yeah, you know, he can say dad, slut, bitch. That's fucked up. You think that's just cute, till they move back in with you, huh? [INAUDIBLE] I just got back from the Bahamas, man. I just fucking got married over there. MIKE: You got married? Yeah, man. Hoping and praying that shit is no-- it's not legal. Why did you get married? Fuck, man, what are you fucking stupid? Cause of the fucking baby. What the-- you know. Plus this bitch has been bugging the shit out of me for 10 years, man. Then she tells me, oh, I'm not going to pay the rent any more unless we get married. Good, [INAUDIBLE] you finally got what you wanted. Yo, who's that girl you just fucked. Bad for the baby, though, because if you think the one parent raising a child is worse than two who hate each other, you're wrong. Here you go with your love. Dr. [INAUDIBLE] No, I think you might be right. [INAUDIBLE] he thinks is right. No, listen to him, boy, listen to him. [INTERPOSING VOICES] Always think this mother fucker's right. He agrees with everything he says. Fucking fruitcake. [BUZZER] Yeah, get the door man. See who the fuck it is. Who is it? KENNY (OVER INTERCOM): Hi, it's Kenny. I'm here to pick up my stuff. TONY: Who is it? That's your girl. That's your girl. You done talked her up. TONY: Oh no. Which one? You'll see her when she come up here. OK. Come on up. Let's get out of here, bro. Hey, what's up? Where's Rick? Uh-- he's in the shower right now. Fucking fruitcake. FRED: But, uh-- I could hook it up. Yeah, if you could take care of it, it'd be great. I have some friends waiting downstairs. - OK. - A quarter would be great. All right. You look familiar. [LAUGHING] Do you go to the energy on Sunday nights? No, man, I used to work there. I didn't know you were friends with Rick. Yeah, man, that's my boy. Mm. Do you ever--do you ever go to the gym together? No, I don't work out there. But I [INAUDIBLE] you know, since I moved down here. That's a great idea. It's a great gym. TONY: Yeah? Wonderful gym. Here you go. All right. What's this? It's so small. Are you sure this is for me? That-- that's it. Rick told me to tell you something like he gets enough in the process for his head, but-- I don't really remember what he said, but he did tell me to tell you that he doesn't do this for her lady. I don't know. That's what he said. You tell him I'll talk to him about it. OK? - All right. And you, I'll see you at the gym. Yeah, I got to come by there. I'll see you. See you. MIKE: Bye. See you guys. Did you see that fucking fruitcake. MIKE: Yeah, I seen. He was fucking in love with me. MIKE: Oh. He's like-- it was like he's never seen anything like it. You sure you don't want his number or something, because I can have him go grab it. Shit, man, you better fucking call him back. I want him to suck my dick. I need-- I need somebody to go out tonight. I'm serious. I can't believe you been fucking with him, for real. [LAUGHING] Tell him to get back here. Heather, girl? Here's Heather. Hold on. I'll be right down. MAN: OK. TONY: Oh, holy shit. Who is that bitch? [MUSIC PLAYING] What's your name? Danielle. - Rick. - Hi. How you doing? What's up? You look bored, like you don't want to be here right now. You know what? I probably am getting a little tired of this place. I've definitely seen you here before. I know, that's the reason I came up to you. I usually open with someone a little bit more original, but since I seen you before I figured, you know, why not just go straight to names? I guess you're right. Well, now you know my name. Now I know your name. Mm-hmm. I guess the next question is where are you from? I thought the next question is what do you do? Oh, all depends on where you are from. Got me? You must be from Manhattan. I am Manhattan. Mm. [GIGGLES] Amy, hi. This is my friend, Amy. What-- what was your name again? Rick. Yeah, I've seen him before. Perhaps. Tell me about it, please? - Hello. - Yo. [LAUGHING] - Hi. [INAUDIBLE] Rick, what's up, man? Oh, hi. Let me get this organized. Hold on a second. OK. This is my cousin, Fred. - Hello. Hi, Fred. How's it going? Nice to meet you. - This is my cousin, Tony. - I'm Tony. - Hey, Tone, how you doing? This is my brother, Mike. Hey, Mikey, how you doing? How are you? All available-- all available, [LAUGHING] and very affordable. [INAUDIBLE] Where's the light? Oh, it's right here. Um-- OK. Can someone just tell me where the bathroom is? Oh, yeah, what you got to do is, you got to go outside, make-- make a left-- OK. --and then go through the door, and then it's right on the right-hand side. - Shut up. It's right down the hall. - Come on. Take a walk. - OK. I'll be [INTERPOSING VOICES] You make things so fucking complicated. [PHONE RINGING] This Fucking idiot over here. You got Rick, leave a message. - What? - Don't what me. You know what. What the fuck is wrong with you, man? I-- they had a car, man. They-- they fucking drove us here. - Car. - Oh, shit. I don't have any lipstick, do you? - Yeah, right here. - OK. Let me see it. Mm. I love this place. It's so like downtown village, you know? If I really wanted to hang, I would have said that before and I could have invited them myself. But now I have to have so that this nigger can get paid. Yo, wait a minute. Aren't you the one who coined the phrase thou shall always think of getting over first, even if it is you friend who wishes to get over and not you. OK. [LAUGHING] Rick fruitcake-- I like that, yeah. You know how many years ago I said that? Centuries ago. Stop acting stupid. I'm acting stupid. I'm not-- - What the fuck is wrong? - All right. When they come in, just entertain them or something. Don't smoke any of my fucking herb. How do I look? Do I look all right? You look fine. - You sure? - Uh-huh. Oh my god, I'm going to get him. [MUSIC PLAYING] [COUGHING] [INAUDIBLE] do you guys smoke? Yeah. All right. So, uh-- what do you guys do? I'm in advertising. AMY: What about you? Well, to be honest with you-- We're strippers. - You are? - Yeah. That's cool. Where? All over, everywhere, here, you know, everywhere. Did-- did he just go to bed? Who, Rick? Yeah. Yeah, I-- I guess so. No, no, no, he didn't go to sleep. He's-- he doesn't-- he-- he was just telling me he really likes you, man. He doesn't think you like him. Did I say something wrong before? I mean, I don't know, maybe he doesn't want us here or something. He wants you here, believe me. It was-- he specifically told me he wanted you here. He's really-- Rick is really shy, man. He doesn't think you really like him. Oh, come on. That's so stupid. I mean, why would I even have talked to him? Would you think I'd be here right now? I wouldn't have come over. We're strippers, man. So we're not used to that. You know, he-- trust me, he's in there praying for you to go in there. I know him. He's my brother. Go in there. I thought the other guy was-- You know, if he doesn't want you, I'll take you. Oh. Do you think so? I mean, do you think I should go in there? AMY: Yeah, get in there. - All right. You know what? I'm-- I'm going to go and see if he's still up. So, I don't know, [INAUDIBLE] Are you sleeping? No, I'm-- I don't fall asleep that easily. Well, what-- what happened? Why did you-- why did you just leave like that? I mean, what-- did I say something wrong? No. No? No, you didn't say anything wrong. Oh. Not in front of you-- not in front of your friend. Oh, come on. What do you want from me? Well, I don't know. I just-- you know you just seem interesting, and, uh-- there's just-- there's something about you. I don't know. Yeah? Mm-hmm. Well, look, I'll be honest with you, if I would have-- if I would have met in my wild stage, something would have happened. But I'm-- I'm trying to get my shit together right now. And you should probably hang out with someone who wants to get to know you. Rick, if you didn't want to get to know me, then why did you even talk to me? I mean, you are the one who came up to me. Do you remember? Wait, don't get me wrong. I'm not trying to be mean. [SCOFFS] You're not trying to be mean? Then what are you trying to be? What? Someone who wants to get to know me? You know what? Fuck you. Oh. No, I'm out of here. AMY: Oh. Ugh, you are such a pathetic loser. [KNOCKING] - Amy, let's go. Amy, we're leaving. - Fuck. DANIELLE: Now. - I got to go. I'll be right there. DANIELLE: Amy, let's go. We're leaving now. Come on. AMY: I said, I'm coming. Look, look, I got to go. I got to go. Come over here. No. For what? So you can insult me some more? RICK: Come here. No. uh-- RICK: Come here. [INAUDIBLE] Come here. [SIGHS] Why are you so upset? Come on, really? How am I'm supposed to take rejection? I'm not rejecting you. I'm just telling you what stage in my life I'm in. Yeah? Well what stage is that? What are you, gay? Come on. What, are you joking me? No, I'm not. Then-- then, why are you rejecting me? I don't understand. What do you--do you think you're too good for me? Is that what it is? No. Then why are you rejecting me? How many guys you fucked in your life? Well, come on. How many guys did I fuck in my life? What does that have to do with anything we're talking about right now? I must have fucked about a million girls in my life, from all around the world. Yeah, and? Well, what I'm trying to say, if you stop interrupting me, is that I want to change, because most of the time I hate myself afterwards. Look, Rick, whatever. You know, I don't see anything wrong with doing what you want, you know, as long as you're having fun, then whatever. Yeah, but I don't do it to have fun. Now do I have to fuck the shit out of you or are you going to let me try to better myself? Ugh. You know what? I'm getting out of here. I'm leaving. OK. - Oh. That's it. AMY: I thought you said you wanted to go? Well, yeah, well, it's about time. Sorry. Look, let's get out of here. I can't even believe we came to this asshole's house. [MUSIC PLAYING] (SINGING) I've been lonely for so long. Don't seem like happiness will come along. I've been lonely for so long. Don't seem like happiness will come along. These ain't rain clouds over my head. Everybody is throwing rocks in my bed. Just can't seem to get ahead in life. [INAUDIBLE] ever turn out right. Won't somebody help me please? Cause I've been lonely for so long. Don't seem like happiness will come along. I've been lonely for so long. Did you miss me? Huh? Did you miss me? [MUSIC PLAYING] (SINGING) Will come along. I lay awake every night trying to figure out how to make things right. Why didn't I say anything? Hey, it's your daughter calling. You're probably out doing something with Timothy. I just got your letter and, oh-- I have another call. Um-- call me soon. OK. I love you. Bye. Hello? Hey. How are you? Good. Yeah, I just saw the guy that lives next door. No, he didn't' even smile at me. I can't fucking believe I didn't say anything. Hi-- uh-- Hi. Hi. So I look like shit. What's your name? Do you like my chain, my rings? That's good, buddy. I'm a disgrace. You're a disgrace. I'm disgusted with the both of yous. Where the fuck did I get these pants? [MUSIC PLAYING] (SINGING) Won't somebody help me please? [KNOCKING] FRED: Yo, what's up? Yo, but when are you going to hook me up with a set of keys, man? Stop bugging me about that. Damn, Fred. You got to be more independent. And that doesn't mean me giving you a set of keys. Shit, if I could have my own place and Mike and Tony could have their own place, you should have your own place. Yeah, but Tony's girl pays for his. Look, that's not the point. He's got his own place. What difference does it make how or who he gets to fuck? Yeah, or who he has to marry. RICK: Right. Yo, bro you got any papers? Uh-- check the top drawer. Oh, shit. Yo, man, I'm going to go to the store. Do You want anything? [INAUDIBLE] RICK: Um-- you know what? I'll go. I'll stay here. You want something from the store? Um-- Come on, Fred, do you want something from the store or not? Just some papers. RICK: Obviously, I'm going to get papers. That's why the fuck I'm going to the store. Nothing else, right? - No. RICK: Don't try to eat my food later. Yeah, OK. RICK: Listen, don't-- don't answer the phone. OK. RICK: I'm serious, Rick, don't answer the phone. I know. All right. See you. RICK: I'll be right back. FRED: OK. All right. Will, I'll be right out here. [MUSIC PLAYING] Yo, Fred, I told you not to pick up the phone. All right, well, take enough out for a joint and put the rest back. What? OK. If he comes by, have him wait. Yeah. And don't answer the phone. Stop acting like yourself. OK. Excuse me, you live around here, don't you? [INAUDIBLE] uh-- I think I saw you last night. I went to pick up my girlfriend and, uh-- you were with these other gentlemen. Oh, you came by last night to pick up that girl? Yeah. That's your girlfriend? Heather girl and me. Tonight, um-- there's a party, right here, I'm giving, um-- 12th and Washington. Bring your friends. Uh-- OK. Happiness. Bring your boyfriends, uh-- your, uh-- your posse. Mm-hmm. Um-- big beige building. Uh-- - OK. And there's only one penthouse. All right, man. Great, I'll, uh-- I'll hope to see you there. OK. Fabulous. Yo, Will? Yo, man, my bitch got me stressed, man. You know, I'm having sex with her tonight, you know, fucking her real good. Uh-- you better take a shower, mother fucker. [LAUGHING] And after I'd washed my ass and I put cologne around my area, on special nights. So I took the blue musk oil and put it around my shit. And I'm watching her suck my dick and shit and I'm enjoying what the fuck is going on. And I'm trying to come in her mouth, for real. I'm trying to come in her mouth. So I'm fucking really concentrating, and for me to come, I have to think of other bitches sometime. - Yeah, I know. Different shit that I've done. Same shit I got to do. So she's sucking my dick and all of sudden, she stops. And I'm like-- like what the fuck is up? And she says to me, you been with another woman. I said, what the fuck are you talking about? She said, cause you smell like a bitch down here. I said, bitch that's for you. I washed my ass and I put cologne down there. [INTERPOSING VOICES] [LAUGHING] How the fuck are you going to stress me out like this? [INAUDIBLE] I care about you. That was for her sucking your dick? Hey, hey, how your dick smell now? [LAUGHING] I keep it fresh. I keep my dick fresh always. Oh. Yo, what's up, man? [INTERPOSING VOICES] Where the fuck do you love birds come from? I'm afraid to tell you when I'm not here. What up, kid? Mother fuckers spying on me. No doubt. Good to see you, baby. Damn, you ain't ready yet, man? What, are you my employer or something? Hey, what's up, Rick? RICK: Damn, you guys just let anybody in here? Yo, Rick, can I talk to you a minute? Yeah, hold on. Where's Freddie? In the bathroom taking a shit or something. Oh, yeah, you like it in the bathroom, bitch. Yeah [INAUDIBLE] [KNOCKING] Who is it? RICK: Come on, asshole. Take it. yeah. [KNOCKING] FRED: Hold on a minute. What, do you guys wait to take shits at my house? That's how come the toilet's stopped up. All right. Hold on a minute. What are you doing in there? FRED: What? Come on, what? Why did you let [INAUDIBLE] Chris up here? No, I--I didn't. You're full of shit. You didn't know he was going to stop by? I mean, I knew he was going to stop by, but I didn't let him up. You're fucking so stupid. He hasn't even paid me what he owes me. Don't give him shit until he pays me what he owes me. I don't even want to talk to him about it. He's lucky I don't fuck him about it. All right. I won't let him up until he brings the money. I mean, use your head. Go over and talk to him. - No, wait. Fred, go to other room. What are you doing? [NERVOUS LAUGHTER] Are you married to the-- go ahead. No, let me just wash my hands. No, no, tell these guys we-- tell them we got to do something. Tell them that we got to go somewhere. We'll meet them later. - All right. I'll go. Let me just wash my hands. What, are guys eating the toilet paper here? No. Bro, let me just wash my hands. RICK: No, no. Come on, Rick. Oh, fuck, bro. What's up, Chris. Yo, you are wearing cologne? What? Are you wearing cologne? Am I what? Are you wearing cologne? Yeah, why? Because it's just that you said you hate cologne. What, I'm wearing cologne. I'm not allowed to wear cologne? No, it's just that you always said how stupid it is to wear cologne. Yo, where are we going anyway? Enough already, Fred. I'm wearing cologne. Kill me. Look, do me a favor. Don't act stupid tonight, please? Why the fuck are your nails so dirty? Come on, bro, it doesn't really matter. It's under the nail. Listen, I'm asking, what do think about reading while you work out? Fuck reading while you work out. If you read while you work out, then you're really doing something with your mind. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. You always say that. Why are your nails so dirty? I told you, bro, it doesn't really matter. I don't care. Do you shower? Yeah, I shower, bro. I shower more than you probably. I mean, come on, bro. You know, I got bad blood circulation, so the shower is good for me. And in my house, I got to get away from my mother, so the best place to go is right to the shower, bro. Because you know why? I do things in the bathroom. I do things like I read there. Right. Do you use soap? To be honest with you, not all the time. Oh. Come on. Tell me you're joking. Please tell me you're joking, Fred. No, bro. I mean, why do I need soap, bro? Because the water, it hits my body and the dirt just goes flying off my mind. It washes away. That's why your nails are dirty. [MUSIC PLAYING] [INAUDIBLE] is everybody. My list is shrinking. It's my face. Why are you my friend? I don't know. Oh, look at me. Watch yourself. All over myself. Well, enjoy yourself. Where the fuck are you taking me, brother? Huh? Dumb ass. He's like a fucking bowl of crunch berries. [LAUGHING] Come on, Fred. There's not a bitch in here, man. Barbara, that's number five. Look at this guy. I will cut you off and kick you out. Thank you. Is everybody having a good time? Yes Are you drinking the good champagne? Just come on. Now, I told you to stop acting stupid. Oh, shut up. Oh. Oh, this is my friend, or soon to be ex-friend, Arthur. - Hello. - That's Fred. Fred, I'm Keith. Oh, wait, wait, Heather is right over there. And I think I should introduce you now because she's thinking of leaving. Come on. Let's go over there. Uh-- where's the bathroom? KEITH: Shoo, faggots. Move. [INAUDIBLE] This is Heather. Hi. Hi. HEATHER: So do you want to take a cab? Yeah, you want to catch a cab? HEATHER: Maybe. All right. (WHISPERING) Fuck you. This is embarrassing. [WHISTLES] We're going down 10 blocks. (WHISPERING) Get the fuck out of here. Oh, you're off? Why did you stop? We could just walk. So did you come by yourself? Um-- I actually-- I came with a friend of mine. I-- I'm going to have to page him and let him know that I broke out. Otherwise, he'll be waiting there the whole night. Did you know I was going to come? Don't you think he'll get the idea that you left, and leave? You don't know my friends. Yes. Yes, what? Yes, I was hoping you would come. Why? Why would someone like you hope that a guy like me would show up? What did your friend tell you? Keith? Nothing. Oh, before the party, you mean. Mm-hmm. Um-- he said that he was afraid to come up to you and that he thought you looked like a killer. [CHUCKLES] Just goes to show you how wrong a guy could be. That's just the city in me. I've been told I'm not the most approachable, but to be honest with you, I'm probably one of the most misjudged, misread guys in the city. I hope so. Otherwise, I'm in trouble. Close your eyes. Why? Don't worry. Close your eyes. All right. Just keep them closed and just listen. [COUGHS] (SINGING) When a man's an empty kettle, he should be on his mettle, yet I'm torn apart. Just because I am presuming I could be kind of human if I only had a heart. I'd be tender, I'd be gentle, and awfully sentimental regarding love and heart. I'd be friends with the sparrows, and the boy who shoots the arrows if I only had a heart. Picture me a balcony, above a voice sings low where for art thou, Romeo? I hear a beat, boom, boom. How sweet just to register emotion, jealousy, devotion, could really feel the part. I could stay young and chipper. In fact I'd lock it with a zipper, if I only had a heart. I've seen you a couple of times before around. I just-- You just never said anything. So you remember seeing me all those times? Yeah? I don't know. I guess, I just never thought the time was right. All right. OK. So thanks for walking me home. It was really nice. Well it wasn't too far out of my way. Um-- goodnight. Goodnight. Would you like to go to dinner with me tomorrow night? Yeah. Yeah? Yeah, I'd love to. All right. So I'll-- I'll be here like 8:00 o'clock. Would that be good? Yeah. Yeah. it's perfect. See you tomorrow. See you tomorrow. Bye. All right. [MUSIC PLAYING] [PHONE RINGING] KEITH (ON ANSWERING MACHINE): I'm shocked, girl. [INAUDIBLE] Heather, girl, it's me, Keith. I hope you got home all right, child. Don't tell me you went home with him on the first night. Keith? You remember the tin man in The Wizard of Oz? Yes. Yes, he knew every word. Yes, he thanked me out of nowhere. It was wonderful. Close this door. Let me see if my friends are home. - OK. - Stay right here. I'll be right back. Don't move. Do what I tell you. Stay right there. (WHISPERING) Yo, Rick? Yo? Let's go, man. Fucking fine. I've got two strippers out there. They're fucking beautiful. This-- this bitch says she knows you. So what do you think? [INAUDIBLE] I don't think this is a good idea though. Why not? We're just hanging out. I know, but we're in this guys house, around his-- we never even met him. I just think we should come back another night. Why don't you have some fun? Come on, we just got here. He's not even out here. We don't even know who he is. Don't you feel like we're intruding? No, I don't. You just want to get laid. No, I thought you said you knew this guy? Huh-uh. I told you I knew who he was. You know that. Who is she? Who gives a fuck who she is. Acting stupid, man-- Hey. Hey, Valentino. What's going on? Where's the bathroom? Um-- go down the hall and make a right. OK. All right, baby. I'm here. I'm going to wait. So, you got a boyfriend? Would I be here if I had a boyfriend? You know, if you're friend's sleeping or if he's tired, I can come back. It's no big deal. No, no, he's not sleeping. He-- he-- he doesn't believe that you're here. He thinks I'm trying to get him out of bed for nothing. You should go in there and talk to him. Talk to him. If not [INAUDIBLE] Hey, beautiful. What's up? Hey. I've been waiting for you, man.

He looks at me, he's like, Mr. Martin-- you know, I gave him a fake name and shit. He's like, I'm afraid to tell you, you've got herpes and gonorrhea. I was like, what? That's it? That's all? I'm out of here, man. Yo, man, you're crazy, bro. No shit. Yo, a fucking shot that big? In my ass, bro. I can hardly move my fucking leg right now. Yo, but you got to make sure you fucking give that shit to a few bitches before you get that shot. - What do you mean? Spread that shit around, man. Somebody gave it to you, so you're fucking giving it back. No, man. That's fucked up, bro. That's like charity and shit. That's fucked up. If I ever get a disease, I know where I'm going to-- you. You got to fuck somebody first to get something like that. Oh, come on, bro. Yo, bro, how can I get a bike like that? You got to look like me. What do mean, look like you? You got to be me, man. You're not me. I'm glad I'm not you. No shit. And you never will be me. No, come on, really, how can I get a bike like that? Stop eating that shit. You got to fuck tons of bitches. Do you think a girl would ever give me a bike like that? Are you crazy? What do you mean am I crazy? I'm asking you. Just forget it, bro. Now look at me and look at you. Yeah. Yeah? So how the fuck you think you're going to get a bike like this? [LAUGHING] You're acting stupid. [INTERPOSING VOICES] Where is this motherfucker, man? RICK: Yo, Will, you-- you ever been married? Married? [INAUDIBLE] 23 years. Why? You thinking about getting married? No, nothing like that. It's-- Ha, I was going to say, you better try staying with a girl more than one night first. Well, seriously, how do you stay with someone that long? How do you make it last? Look, honestly, Rick, I can give you a million reasons what I think, and what I think it takes, but I really-- I really don't know, man. If I like a girl, she won't like me, and if she likes me, I won't like her. Maybe you just haven't found the right girl yet. Hmm? You know, but then maybe you're looking for the wrong things. Yeah, I-- I don't know. Maybe I'm off. Maybe there's something wrong with me. Rick, they're ain't nothing wrong with you, man. You just gotta change your attitude. It seems like you don't want to give anything or anybody a chance. Rick, I'm just Will, nothing fancy. Give me a couple of quarters, I put milk in your coffee. If it's meant to be, then it's meant to be. Man, that motherfuckers in love with that anorexic bitch. - Oh, come on. - You couldn't believe that? No, no, no, bro. [INAUDIBLE] I never seen anything like it, man. No, hey, yo, you know she ditched him, right? - No shit, yeah? - Yeah, swear to god. I knew it. I knew that shit was going to happen. I told him. I knew it was going to happen. Yo, Rick? TONY: Yo, what's up, man? FRED: Where you been? TONY: Where were you, bro? Where you coming from? What are you, my mother? TONY: Listen to this guy, after we wait hours here for you. Whose bike? TONY: That's mine, man. Some girl just bought that for me. FRED: He got it for free. TONY: I worked for it. Yo. You know I was going to clean the fridge. Didn't I tell you about shit-- doing shit like that? That's why I don't every let you hang out with me. Pick that up. [INAUDIBLE] [GLASS BREAKING] [INAUDIBLE] [VOCALIZING] What the fuck is wrong with you, man? [INAUDIBLE] - OK. Go ahead. It's your turn. I can't believe that girl gave you that bike, man. What are you going to tell your girlfriend? - Who, Carol? - Yeah. Oh, man, I told her it was Rick's. And she believes you? No shit she believes me. She fucking believes anything I tell her. FRED: Come on, it's my turn. What are you guys doing? Yo, what's up, man. We're waiting for you, man. You're waiting for me? What do you mean, you're waiting for me? To hang out, man. What do you think? I want to go out tonight, bro. And then what? FRED: Then what-- We'll hang out, then we'll come back here later, then we'll go out again. Yeah. What you want to do, Rick? You guys obviously just don't get it, do you? Yo, if you're upset over this girl, man, don't take it out on us, man. I just came up from the fucking hospital. The hospital? TONY: Yeah, man. For what? TONY: They gave me a fucking shot a foot long, man. They said I had gonorrhea. [LAUGHING] Yo, what the fuck are you doing? Turn it back on. Of course, you had it. I can't fucking believe you. And you-- and you gave it to Carol, right? Yeah, well, she's the one that fucking told me she has something. So I had to fucking play it out like she gave it to me and shit, you know? You know, I did the best acting of my whole entire life to get that fucking bitch to actually believe that she got it from the fucking toilet seat. [LAUGHING] Oh shit. RICK: That's funny to you? You think that's funny? TONY: Yeah. Yeah, that's funny. What the fuck is so funny about that? What the fuck is so fucking funny about that? Why the fuck would that be funny? You think it's fucking funny that he gives his fucking girl a disease? What the fuck is funny about giving your poor girl a disease? You would have done the same shit, man. Not now. Not-- not-- not now. Maybe a long time ago, not now. That's the difference between you and me. You got nothing to say about that? What the fuck's the matter with you? RICK: Fred, you're not that stupid. You-- you really-- I've been trying to-- let me-- let me try my best to communicate this to you. We-- we go out every night-- every night to get pussy, like vampires, and we suck their souls only-- only because we can. And know when when we pay for it? You want to know when it comes back to us? Freddie, do you want to know when it comes back to us? When we're fortunate enough to finally find someone. And Tony, you and I both know that we don't have a lot of people. And when we're fortunate enough to find someone that we really care about, that-- that's when it's too late. You-- you guys know-- because they are too pure to love. [CRYING] It doesn't matter what I say. Tony, maybe I am affected by this. Look, I taught both of you and if I taught that this wasn't-- that it wasn't cool to be affected, then maybe I taught you guys wrong. Just lock it when you go. Well, did you call him? No. Heather, girl, this has nothing to do with your parents, does it? No, no, no, they relaxed a little when they found out I was serious. I do think they would have been shocked though if I brought him to the wedding. Seems some things just never change. Look, that's not the issue for me. I love being with him. We get along beautifully. But there's this side to him that I just don't understand. He doesn't want to be anything or do anything with his life. There's no ambition. And he has this violent side that I just don't understand. I mean, I am completely foreign to that type of mentality. Look, I don't know anything about his ambition, but I certainly don't get uncontrollable violence from him. Hmm. [INAUDIBLE] He doesn't care about the future. His morale's been destroyed-- Well, Heather, sometimes people have been hurt, or have had their confidence destroyed and feel that there's no real hope, because whatever. And sometimes, all this person needs is someone to care for them, [MUSIC PLAYING] and to show affection, and to believe in them. And if you really do love that boy, you'd be a fool to give up on him. Want this? Want this? Oh, yeah. Here. I'll give you this. This is all yours. Yeah? Absolutely. Just don't make it an occupation. Make what you can make off it. Don't make it an occupation. All right, thanks, man. Don't thank me too quickly. [BEEP] TIMOTHY (ON PHONE): Mom, it's Timothy. When are you going to be done taking pictures? Mama, I like you reading to me better than grandma. When are you coming home for Uncle Jimmy's wedding? Mom, I miss you. I love you. Thank you. May I borrow your pen? Sure. CAB DRIVER: Where going? I'm going to go see my mom. It's a classic. It's a favorite. So I've been told. Thank you. Enjoy. Enjoy and come back again. [MUSIC PLAYING] (SINGING) We are living through, we don't need it. We need love. We all, whoa, yes we do. In the stars. We in the stars [INAUDIBLE] Yeah, the time is right. Everything that you should [INAUDIBLE] We all need some kind of love. Lou, can you bring me my glass of water? It's on the table. And hurry up, I'm late for work. [MUSIC PLAYING] (SINGING) Little boy wants a little girl to make a part of his little world. So she can look in his deep blue eyes, without wearing any deep disguise. All I want is a little love to be sure and [INAUDIBLE] love [INAUDIBLE] it's you. You. It's you. Your heart [INAUDIBLE] Little boy wants a little girl to make apart of his little world. Little boy wants a little girl to make a part of his little world, so she can look in his deep blue eyes, without wearing any deep disguise.

Oh, he's so smart. [LAUGHING] [MUSIC PLAYING] (SINGING) Just enough to get by. Cause I'm shaking inside. Got to work in a [INAUDIBLE] Cause I'm going in style. Give me some for the ride. It's a thing I can't hide, cause I'm shaking inside. Help me show my good side. Just enough to get by, cause I'm shaking inside. Got to work in [INAUDIBLE] Cause I'm going in style. Cause I'm shaking inside. Good. I think you got it.
