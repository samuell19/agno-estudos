Around 12 loads, Brother How could you guys go and surrender 3 crores worth of stock to DSP Govindappa? Donâ€™t we have anyone who can transport the load by hoodwinking Govindappa? He is catching us in whichever way we go. It is not possible to send a load when he is around. Itâ€™s crazy why you are over-praising Govindappa here. Like a restless lady who throws in the towel with her neighbor. Leave it - its all beyond your ability. Who the hell is he? He is a coolie fellow. What the hell, Just because you came in a car you think you earned a right to speak in this meeting. Get outâ€¦ Brother, he is the same guy whom we got out on bail, Pushpa. I only asked him to come along. Are you the one who hid our load and collected five lakhs from us? Five lakhs are not for hiding the load Sir. Itâ€™s for protecting you and your brothers from going to jail. As if you donâ€™t knowâ€¦ it is not a big deal to get beaten by Police. Speak if you have guts to transport the load without getting caught. You need an idea for transporting the load. Not gutsâ€¦ Yes brother. what our people are doing is... Covering the load with Tomatoes and Watermelons. They move the fruits, they see the load.. Forget Govindappa, Our load can be found even by a useless Gurkha also. We have to send the load but no one should know. I have an idea. Should I tell? You want to tell us how to transport the load. Everyone See, who has come to give us ideas. Coolie fellow. say what you think. Say.. sayâ€¦ Is this a pickle to share with the entire world? Ideas brother... how can I say it Infront of everyone...?

I can do the complete the work all alone. Just tell me what you will pay me. your rate only Pushpa. We will pay you what we paid last time.. 5 lakhs per load. Is it Ok? Five lakhs is not okay. Give me 4 percent. 4 percent would mean 4 lakhs. You will lose one lakh. You can keep that one lakh to yourself, just pay my 4 percent. What is this bro? He was willing to pay 5 lakhs.. One lakh is our loss. If we had taken five lakhs, we would have been their servants. By taking 4 percent, wonâ€™t we become his partners.? Now, Kondareddy and we are Partners.. Partner Pushpa here. You are very smart brother. Hey, why is everyone looking at the sky like that? Looking for the sparrows. What? For Sparrows Butâ€¦Why? Broâ€¦ see that girl sitting there, wearing a red saree?

Go and do 5000 rupees worship. ONE thousand tonnes of Syndicate goods! Approximately two hundred crores! and halting here instead of enroute Chennai.. That Mangalam Seenu, rotating syndicate goods That's why we are not able to track the locations. It is possible that the goods will be coming to Kondareddy godowns. If you tip us off the moment he lands new stuff, do you know the reward? Fifty Lakh Rupees. How are you Draccha? - Iâ€™m good Uncle Srinu? What brings you here? Excellent location Konda Reddy. Godown is also nice. Even Draccha liked it. He is Mangalam Seenu. The boss of the smuggling syndicate! There may be the likes of Kondareddy snoring at corners to sweat small stuff... he is the only one man who can navigate the goods all through the 15 checkpoints to the Chennai Port. Thatâ€™s why he is the one who calls the shots. Nobody can go against him and get away with it. I see that you are shifting all the load into my godown. What is the issue? You know Gowrreddy right... - Who? Our Gowrreddy?? I dismissed him from job as he was messing up the with goods. How could you do that man? What if he informs the police? He knows addresses of all your godowns very well. Thatâ€™s why I brought all the stock to your godown kondareddy. We still have some time to take it to Chennai. Please safeguard the stocks. I hope itâ€™s safe What are you talking dear? Did we bring the stock directly here without trusting Kondareddy uncle? But the problem is that stock is safeguarded by that Jaali Reddy. And you know that womanizer Jaali reddy is surrounded always by girls. If we trust and leave our stock with here, it is like digging our own graves. You said it right. If Govindappa comes behind a girl, the entire stock will go for a toss. Syndicate has trusted me and kept the stock with me You said it right dear... No need to worry. Now we have a sharp guy called Pushpa. He is taking care of everything. After he came, Police are not able to catch even a stem, forget a log.. there he comes.. see You are saying he is new. Can we trust him? I will tell in detail about him some other time Seenu He doesnâ€™t look like the one to be discussed another time. Anyways, I have to go for a wedding. I take your leave Pushpa, Srinannaâ€™s stock will be with us for two days. Take care of it.. Sure, Brother - Brother, we are getting late. Come fast.. What did you do with Gowrreddy? Are you ignoring him or what? Donâ€™t look at sky always uncle, look at the earth also sometimes. We get trees from the there only.. wont you put manure to it.. Brother, Look there once. No... He is like my younger brother. I canâ€™t see him die. Why does this Mogalesh do incomplete work always ? Get me the gun... Give me. Why do we need this garbage in our backyard? Throw it in the forest Okay Brother Go and do that work. Bro... What is this? -Cardamom bro.. for a good smell I have. Why delay? Where are the girls? They are coming brother. They are waiting... Go Go... go. Go and kiss him. Iâ€™m scared dear. What if he bites me? Why are you scared? He looks so handsome. What is that meeting they are having there? I donâ€™t know brother Why delay girl? He is waiting since morning. Send her fast What is your problem to give a small kiss? If you canâ€™t.. I will go and give him. Tell me You wait, As If we canâ€™t do that. Bro Should I come and give you the kiss? Who is that? Calling me brother and offering me a kiss. Where did you find them? Stop those discussions and send her fast I am feeling scared -Shut up and come. She is coming bro.. she is Coming He is asking for a small kiss. Go and give him a kiss, go... Keshava, close the door No, keep it open What are you doing here dirty fellow? Iâ€™m noticing you since long. Why are you shouting? Stop those antics.. I will slap you hard idiot Do it fast Pushpa and letâ€™s go. Girls, turn away. Okay dear, as you wish! - No touching! What is this? What you are chewing? Cardamom... do you want? Not there. I will kiss you here Here? - Yes Why should we pay so much for a kiss here? Hey Keshava Ok ok. Donâ€™t make it an issue.. Okay. Ok give me.. Talk something. What is there to talk? You took money to kiss me. Right.. so kiss me.. Why are you crying girl?.. why? I thought it is easy when my friends told me. But my heart isnâ€™t agreeing. First kiss.... How will I understand if you murmur? Say it clearly I always wanted to give first kiss to my husband... To your husband? If you wanted it to give to someone else, why did you take money from me? And why are you crying now? Stop crying... Stop it why are you crying now? What happened dear? My god What did you do brother? I didnâ€™t do anything brother. I didnâ€™t even touch her -What did you do? Why is the poor girl crying so much? Ask Srivalli. Hey Srivalli. Did I do anything to you? We trusted and sent our friend and is that what you do to her? Stop your nuisance for a minute I didnâ€™t do anything brother. You all go away... In hurry he would have bite her. (Indistinct Voices) What happened, bro? She is making ruckus here. Leave it bro. She said she will kiss her husband only right Itâ€™s my kiss man. I paid for it. If I have to marry her and become her husband, I will. I should only get that kiss.. I wonâ€™t compromise on this Hey what is this? The entire stock is still here. Didnâ€™t I tell you that we must cross the check post with this by the night? Jalanna was partying the whole night. He has stopped the lorries as they might disturb the party. Have your brains gone dead? Who is Jaali to stop the stock? Don't know, Brother. Police are observing us like Jackals for this address since night, and you know how risky it is.. Where are the keys? That is Jalannaâ€™s room. He will kill if we give you the keys What will he do? Pushpa, What are you doing? Don't scare, come sister... Hey Keshav, please ask our guys to drop her in the village safely. Okay. Go... Selva, take her and leave her in the village. I will be here. Okay. You go. -Come... Hey, do it fast. Pushpa has sent the girl home We are loading all the stock in the lorries. Why did you send the girl? First tell me why you didnâ€™t you send the stock. Have you converted the godown into your guest house? Who are you to ask me? This is my godown you are just a coolie fellow. How dare you call me coolie? This is Pushpa. Partner Pushpa. 4 Percent share. Give it now Speak to him brother Pushpa, Kondareddy brother wants to speak to you Donâ€™t you use what you have above neck instead of what you have below the waist? Bro, please tell Police have come to know our godown address What are you saying brother? Hope all the stock is cleared from the godown No brother. Your brother Jaali has stopped all lorries from entering the godown My god! Thousand tons stock. It is worth 200 crores. We will be done forever if we are caught. Mangalam Srinu has trusted us and handed over the stock. Do something... You have trusted me and handed over to me.. consider Pushpa is dead, if even one log is caught. How scared he is, the slave! Jalareddy, youâ€™ll get it now! Pushpa doesnâ€™t budge an inch, always gives it back! How do we tackle this? Okay bro. Rey... Pick the stock and throw it in the stream. What are you looking at? Police are coming. Get up and move Brother, listen to me once. Entire stock is being thrown into water here. That's all Mangalam Srinu's Stock. We can put it on Pushpa if Govindappa catches it. Not good for you to be there now. Leave from there immediately Pushpa is caught now. Srinu will not leave him. I am sure his time is over now.. Police are here. Brother...Log Come fast. Quickly. Come on, quick rotate... Sir, They have put towers in the forest too. They would have known the information by now Rey...Is stock there? - Sir, nothing is there here. Total license wood If Pushpa is there stock will not be there. If stock is there Pushpa wonâ€™t be there. If you want to see both together, none of you will be there. We should all be thankful to Govindappa Sir! - Yes Bro. Our range has grown because of this sir only... If he had caught the stock that day, I wouldnâ€™t have become a partner today.. Donâ€™t say like that brother? Sir may get angry What sir? Are you getting angry?? Alas... I donâ€™t even have shirt for you to hold my collar. I have given it to a girl just now. Not just you sir, we also do good deeds Rey... You are not understanding what you are doing... You are more cruel than animals... Yak What is crueler than this world sir? This world has given a gun to your hand and an axe to my hand. Everyone has his own war to fight. I have won this war also sir I will take care of whatever comes. Yes, You have won. But do you know what kind of war you are fighting? You will lose as much as you are winning today. You will know as you age.. Losers will always talk about principles. When does the party start? Heard about Mangalam Srinu party, but first time I am seeing it. Not only smugglers but police, politicians all have come to party. When one saw so much money Pushpa has become hero instantly. Mangalam Srinu himself personally introduced him to MP They kill me with their looks if I wear a saree They scan me with their eyes if I wear a skirt Forget saree and gown, let me divulge a secret What is there in the dress when Itâ€™s your hold that matters Will you say yes Dear. Or will you say No Will you say yes Dear. Or will you say No One becomes upside down if Iâ€™m fair One creates uproar if Iâ€™m dark Forget fair and dark, let me reveal the true color Color and figure wonâ€™t matter once you enter the field Will you say yes Dear. Or will you say No Will you say yes Dear. Or will you say No One jumps with joy If Iâ€™m tall One shouts and wails if Iâ€™m short Forget tall and short, let me tell you a truth You will be satiated with what you get Will you say yes Dear. Or will you say No Will you say yes Dear. Or will you say No One feels happy If I'm stout One feel bliss If I'm slender Forget stout and slender It is the man's wicked nature who caught me alone. Will you say yes Dear. Will you say No Will you say yes Dear. Will you say No One person poses like a respected man... I have a very good heart says one person There is no good or bad, everyone belongs to the same race when the lights are off... when the lights are off... Will you say yes Dear. Will you say Yes Will you say yes Dear. Or will you say No Will you say yes Dear. Or will you say No Mangalam Sreenu has arranged a super party He will get 2 crores from us and give only 25 lakhs to them Then, not only party, he can do anything. Figure, liquor... Brother, I want to speak to you urgently. - What is that? That Mangalam srinu is cheating us bro. Mangalam srinu is fooling us. How much does he give us per ton? Twenty-five lakhs right. He is selling for Two crores outside.. How do you know? I have heard from the Murugan's people when they were talking to each other Of late I was also getting doubt on him... He is buying lands in lot of places. What do you say now? Nothing to say. Letâ€™s go and ask We are loosing so much bro. We are all working hard and he is sitting and enjoying all the fruits. Ask him Brother What? you want to go and ask Mangalam Srinu, is it? Yes -Do you know what he is? Hey Stop... You stop. You can go and ask but there are lot of other things between me and Srinu. We will get into trouble if anything goes wrong. What is this? -Dry mutton curry. Go and get snacks. Do one thing man. You go and ask him that people are talking like this outside. You are also partner right. If he agrees 50% share... else, you didnâ€™t ask me anything. There is no relationship between us. What do you say? No Brother. If anyone has to ask him, it is you brother. It wonâ€™t look good if I ask Thatâ€™s why... Hey Muniratnam did you see Pushpaâ€™s range. He is having lunch with Kondareddy... and he also doing business with him You said it right. He used to come to work for a wage of hundred, hundred and fifty. Now he has become very big Where will you get a better match for your daughter than him. Why donâ€™t you get her married to our guy? How did you say such a big thing so easily in a serious discussion? How can I give my daughter without knowing his caste and gotra? Hello... Do you know who he is? He is younger son of Molleti Venkata Ramana Is that so? Then he is our own. Good match Munirathnam, The groom family is here. Please come in. Namaste! See, How Muniratnam face is glowing Our lives are such that we feel happy if Molleti Venkataramana says hi to us. A match with such family meansâ€¦ Its all god grace Here! What are you looking at? Move... come in please. Sit... please sit down. Hey, you go. What did you guys tell him? He is talking strangely What did you say? Thatâ€™s what Bro. I told him that you are third son of Molleti Venkataramana. Did you say like that? Iâ€™m somehow getting scared Whatâ€™s wrong? Did he not tell what the truth is..? Not like that my son -Be silent Mom. Bro. Srivalli is coming. Bring the girl. (Chants) The girl is looking beautiful. Girl, I had told you earlier only. It was just a small kiss. You should have given it to him. See it has come up to marriage. Now you have to keep kissing him for life. That too for free. This is all because of that Keshava I'll hit you...! Pushparaj, the youngest son of Rangampet resident Molleti Venkata Ramana and the resident of Yarravaripalem villageâ€¦ We have seen the people who sell fruits in the name of the tree. We came here knowing that someone is selling fruits without even know which tree has given those fruits They are Venkataramanaâ€™s sons. Greetings Sir. It is said that relationship means it has to have 7 generations both sides Why is it that you are not looking at even to one generation? Do you know to whom you are giving your daughter for marriage? What are saying sir? He said he is third son of Molleti Venkata Ramana. Isnâ€™t he your younger brother? Will someone become king just because he has Raju in his name? and my brother if he takes my fatherâ€™s name? He is anyways shameless to say it. She is a lady shouldnâ€™t she have any shame ? Son, you sit quietly. Swear on me that you wonâ€™t get up Have you seen what is in that? Did you see any surname? No Sir, its only written as Pushpa raju Thatâ€™s the story. He is surviving by using our surname So what if he doesnâ€™t have surname, what is it that Pushpa doesnâ€™t have..? He has a house and earns handful. Isnâ€™t it enough to take care of your girl? What do you say Muniratnam? You said it rightly what will he take care? Do you think wedding is just exchanging vows? We get a girl married to change her surname. I wonâ€™t send her to such house. Get up dear. You wait... listen to me. You sit my dear. Sit. Hey Son, you both are brothers and you share the same blood.. when such good occasions are happening, one should overlook and move on. I agree with you I agree that my father had an affair with his mother. But what is the guarantee that he is born to my father? My father didnâ€™t tell me. What man? Did your mother at least tell you to whom you are born? What? How dare you? (Commotion) (Commotion) Pushpa! -Bro, Mother... Bro, Mother... Mom! Mom! Mom! Keshava, get the vehicle. Throw her out! Please leave me... Please I plead you... Leave me alone. Mom! Please... let me see his face once. Father! When your father asked me weather I want love or respect, then I thought love was enough. I thought his respect is mine too. But I never thought you will face so many insults because of this. Had I known it, I would have taken some poison when you were in my womb. Mom! Please forgive me, my son. What is this maa? What are you talking? What happened now? You have injuries on your head thatâ€™s why you are talking like this.. Sleep now. Grandma... Please maker her sleep. Donâ€™t cry my dear. Drink some porridge. Mom... Get some tea. Do you have money? -I have bro. Bro... I was just five-year-old then. I didnâ€™t even know how to fight. These guys have created all kinds of troubles and took away whatever we had. My father had given me a gold chain for my birthday. In that chain there used to be photo of me and my father. That was the only thing I had as a memory in those things. They took away that as well. I wonâ€™t keep silent if they try to take away what I have to get. Whether it is 10 paise or 10 rupees. I wonâ€™t spare anyone. I wonâ€™t spare anyone, even if its Srinivasa on the hill or Mangalam Srinu down the hill. I will collect everything with interest. This is Pushpa Pushparaj here. I wonâ€™t compromise. Beat him hereâ€¦not there I have already beaten him there bro. Beat him on his knee? On his kneeâ€™s bro? That handâ€¦ Mouth... Beat him on the mouth. Idiot shouldnâ€™t open his mouth again. Broâ€¦ He is scared Thatâ€™s why I asked you to beat. How dare he comes directly to me and ask me to increase the rate? It seems, Twenty-five is not enough for him.. he wants fifty lakhs per ton. Fiftyâ€¦ Do you want Fifty lakhs? If I donâ€™t give, you want to deal with Chennai Murugan directly? Why canâ€™t you beat him yourself? You are sitting happily and ordering him? Bro... Stop now. Drink this and take a breath. Havenâ€™t you got tired beating him since morning? Unnecessary fuss all the time She talks like that only. You carry onâ€¦ Hello MP Sir. Come Pushpa. Sit. Yes. Tell me MP Sir Hey Srinu. Heard that you kidnapped Nagesh. His brother came and is regretting for the mistake that happened. Leave him for this time. I will speak to you So sad... I just killed him MP Sir. Brotherâ€¦ You should have called me five minutes ago. Iâ€™m just washing the knife after cutting his neck and your call came.. I had called your PA also in the morning Sir. He also didnâ€™t say anything. Hello MP Sir, please tell me in advance if there is something like this next time. Itâ€™s a matter of a personâ€™s life. Isnâ€™t it? I donâ€™t want any differences between you and me unnecessarily. That's it sir... I take leave. How are you Pushpa? -Iâ€™m fine, Sister. That is the matter. Hey Nagesh. I have given a word to the big man on the other side. I will go wrong if I leave you. Hey, Cut him into pieces. Okay. You guys have spoilt the entire floor... Hey Venkatesu... make it clean. What Pushpa? What made you come to me? How is Kondareddy? He is fine Brother. Brother, I have mixed the color. What is this? Is this black? Yes, black sir. Last time also you had said it was black but had turned brown. It was so awkward in front of everyone It just happened like that last time brother. This time it will be black for sure. I donâ€™t have confidence in you. Put on him and show. apply on him. See Pushpa, how he died struggling. Else, he wanted Fifty lakhs per ton. All you have to do is to cross two check posts and deliver stocks to me. I must cross fifteen check posts to transport the stock to Chennai. Can you imagine how difficult it is? I agree brother, It is a very difficult job indeed. Even I faced difficulty near fifteenth check post. That SI Manikandan you know right. He asked me for one lakh rupees. That fellow. Somehow, we made sure the stock reached Chennai safely brother. Have delivered the stock to Chennai? Who told you to do that? The twenty-five lakhs you give is not enough. If you give one crore per ton, I will sell to you only. Crore? What is it bro? If I say noâ€¦ Whom did he say he will sell brother? Chennai Murugan. I will sell it to him only. Why should I go to a new person? Hey, do you understand what you are asking? We just cut his neck for asking fifty lakhs only. And here you are asking for one crore. Donâ€™t you see what just happened.. ? I understand man. I came here to ask fifty lakhs only. But after seeing him, I understood how high the risk is.. thatâ€™s why I am asking for a crore... Am I right brother? Brother, tell me whether you can one crore per ton. Otherwise, I will sell to Chennai Murugesan only. All of you think about it and call me. Okay? I take leave brother. Oh! What is this bro? This is black for sure. Donâ€™t worry and get it applied. Brother, why did you leave him like that? You are coming and asking me, half an hour after he left? I was in shock that he was speaking like that even after seeing what death looks like. Do you think I was in a dream sequence with your sister? I was also in a shock. We have left him unnecessarily bro. We should have killed him. What do you say Singireddy? Yes, Brother Brother, Can I make a call? Brotherâ€¦Murugan. Greetings Bro. This is syndicate member Pushpa speaking. This time we donâ€™t want to sell stock to Mangalam Srinu. Thinking of selling it to you directly. Okâ€¦ Ok Brother. Stock has already reached Chennai Sir. I will come to Chennai tomorrow and discuss rate with you. Ok. Write down my pager number brother. Eight Threeâ€¦Eight four... You fool! I didn't left because you spared me I left because I decided to leave. What? You thought Pushpa means flower... It's Fire! Fire! Who are you? What do you want? We have come to meet Murugan. Is it? Heyâ€¦ who are they? Pushpa, Syndicate member. Came from Tirupati to discuss business. Hey, say Pager No. 8384. He will recognize us with that Why are you shouting in my ear? Hey, Murugan Sir is busy and he said he canâ€™t meet anyone. You heard it right! Murugan Sir wonâ€™t meet anyone. Leave now Let him say that after seeing this piece. What is this? This is Broâ€™s visiting card. He will understand if he looks at it Its 07:45 PM It's tea time for Murugan sir. Quickly go and give a tea to Murugan sir. Hey, Tea wonâ€™t go anywhere. Murugan himself will come to tea What is this man? A grade stock. I had seen it long back when I started the business. Iâ€™m seeing it again now. This is gold. How many hills we have to climb up to see lord Venkateswara... Likewise that many hills you need to climb down to find this kind of stuff This is A grade Stuff. The smuggler who buys never knows where we can get it The one who the cuts the tree knows the exact place Open the door. Two tonsâ€¦five trucks We have ten tons of stock Super man! Will speak to Mangalam Srinu and fix the rate. You leave. Brother, We have decided not to sell the stock to Mangalam Srinu. That is why we came directly to sell it to you. Thatâ€™s why we brought it this far. Do you want stock or not? Hey, close the door. Start the vehicles... -Bro.. bro... Mangalam Srinu is very dangerous. Can you do business defying him? Can you buy the stock defying him? Any who came here defying Mangalam Srinu and they are all dead. Brother, many would have come to you. I called from Srinannaâ€™s place only and told you that I am coming to you Iâ€™m different bro. Who are you? Are you a crack? Do you know to whom you are talking to? I am Kondareddyâ€™s partner. Kondareddy himself sent me here to talk to you. Are you Kondareddyâ€™s man? You should have told me that earlier. Call him. Let me speak once. That, only after negotiating the price.. Tell me what is the rate? Hello! Brother Kondareeddy Hey Pushpa. Didnâ€™t see you for the last 2 days. Where did you go? I came to Chennai? Chennai? Why?? I came here to meet Murugan. To meet Murugan? Hey Jakka. He says he went to meet Murugan Whose permission did you take to go to Murugan? I asked you to go and meet Mangalam Srinu, right? What bro? Doesnâ€™t Kondareddy know that we came here? Just because we gave 4% share, you want to act as you wish? One and half croreâ€¦ One and half crore per ton. I just negotiated the deal with Murugan. As usual, do you want me to sell to Mangalam Srinu for twenty-five lakhs or take risk and sell it to Murugan for one and half croreâ€¦ Understood bro. I will tell Muragan brother that you canâ€™t do business defying Mangalam Srinu. I will tell him that we donâ€™t have the guts. I held back for all these days not because I donâ€™t have guts. I stopped because I was bound by Syndicateâ€™s decision. When we know that Mangalam Srinu is cheating us, who cares for the syndicate? Finalize the deal. Brother... 50% share to me and 50% to you from the profits. You remember we agreed on this the other day. How dare you information to police about us.. you idiot? What is the point of talking to him brother, when he was informing everything about us to Police. I donâ€™t have anything to do with it.. brother. He did everything. You knew, that he was doing all this. I know, brother. Why didnâ€™t you not inform us? He lured me with money. I got greedy in the hope to perform my daughterâ€™s marriage. Daughter? Who is that? Does he have a grown up daughter.. ? same one brother, the one you saw when she came to see â€˜Choodalani undiâ€™ Movie.. that one.. Is she, his daughter? Isnâ€™t she beautiful? I saw her from far. She looks just ok bro Then ask her to come once. We shall talk to her Lay him down here. Rey, You guys go and get his parents My... Where is my father? What happened to him. Iâ€™m asking you. What happened to my father? Tell me. What happened to my father? Rey Busappa, you said she is just ok. But she is looking superb like a film heroine. Your father is alive. But go home and have a bath with lux soap. wear this saree with jasmine flowers and come here in the night. Then, You can take your father home in the morning. Get ready like a bride for Jalanna and come. What? Canâ€™t you adjust for one night for the sake of your fatherâ€™s life? Goâ€¦Go. Hey! Bro! Go out and have some beer and biryani. Come back in the morning. Ok bro. Rey, we can do this in the morning. Letâ€™s go. Rey. Letâ€™s go (Song) How come you came here dear? Have you lost your way? Jalreddy is saying that he will kill my father Why Jalreddy? Even I would kill him. How could your father show loyalty to the Police? He said he will spare him, if I sleep with him tonight. You came all decked up right. Go there. Why did you come here? If I go there tonight, my father might return home in the morning... but I will not be able to come to your house ever. Why do you want to come to the house of a guy who doesnâ€™t have surname? You must have felt happy on the day the relation broke. You must have felt very happy that you have gotten rid of me, and you donâ€™t need to see my face ever again. Is this what you understood? You are like this, from the beginning. When did you ever understood the heart of a girl that you can understand today. When my friends told me that you are feeling sad, because I was not looking at you, I felt very happy that this boy likes me so much. I liked you as soon as I saw you. When you gave me money and asked for a kiss... I thought this is your way of expressing love. When I said that I want to give first kiss to my husband, I gave an indication to you to marry me. You didn't understand even that. My father doesnâ€™t even start the lorry without my nod. Do you think you could come to my house for marriage proposal without my wish? Do you know how bad I felt seeing you anxious when mother-in-law got hurt? You could have understood that, had you seen into my eyes once. You left even without looking at me. Do you mean to say, that I should change my heart after hearing whatever you said... and go fight with jaali and save your father? It is not going to happen. Leave now I know that you wonâ€™t do anything like that. Your money and business are important to you, Isnâ€™t it? Why will you fight for a stranger like me? Anyways, I didnâ€™t come for that. Then why did you come? I always wanted to share my first kiss and my first night with someone whom I consider my husband. Please sleep with me once. You will never see me again. I will go. And after that I donâ€™t care what happens to my life. What is this dear? Do you love me so much? You think I will allow anyone to lay his hand on you after what you said. Whoever it is.. will not allow What Pushpa? You only brought the girl to make her sleep with me. Are you doing all this for just 4 percent? I won't leave her. Are you firing? Dear, Come here. Are you firing bullets on to the girl? I am going to kill you, idiot. How dare you lay a hand on girls? Muniratnam! Muniratnam, get up! Look Srivalli, your father is fine. I made him sit in the car. What is this man? You have hit Jalreddy so badly. O Jalanna. I feel pity looking at you. What maccha? You made him incapable for anything. If Kondareddy gets to know if this, he will kill you bro. Hey, who will tell? This fellow only should say if at allâ€¦ What man? What will you tell your brother? Will you go cry before him and tell him shamelessly that Pushpa beat you. Ey Jaali, Go and complain. I donâ€™t care. Dear, come letâ€™s go. We will get it resolved either this way or that way. Iâ€™m ready for whatever happens. Pushpa, Iâ€™m not an idiot to go and complain to my brothers. This is between you and meâ€¦ and I will deal about this with you directly. I wonâ€™t leave you. This.. This ..This .. This is what is called as being a man. What you did with women all these days is not like a man. Now you have proven that you are a man. Now stand on your word. Kesava, he has masculinity in him. I think he will stand on his word. What dear? What do you think? I too believe the same He will stand on his word right How will he stand, when you have already broken everything. Muniratnam, Come... come. Pushpa, I will park the car at home and come. Srivalli, I will take leave. Pushpa! Come and have dinner. No need Aunty. My mom is waiting for me... I have to go. Pushpa, wait a minute. You come. My mom asked me to give this to you. Okay. You go. Why are you staring at me? Go. What girl? What girl? When you call me Dearâ€¦ Dear, I feel like I have become your wife Darlingâ€¦ My Darling When I call you Darlingâ€¦ Darling, you suit well as my Husband Darlingâ€¦ My Darling When I walk behind you When I walk behind you It feels like going uphill to Venkanna Temple, Darling When I sit next to you It feels like I got Lord Parameshwara.

You and I may have million things between usâ€¦ but when an outsider comes, you are my partner. Thatâ€™s it. You think I will sit and watch? What manâ€¦ why are you coming on to me like that. If my brother-in-law comes to know of it he wonâ€™t leave you.. If you something harm to me, my brother-in-law wonâ€™t leave you. Why are you taking out the gun? Will you kill me? My brother-in-law wonâ€™t keep quite if you do anything to me. He will kill all of you. True Pushpa, It will become a big mess if you touch him. He is getting scared. He is getting scared.

Brother in lawâ€¦ Why are you silent, bro? wondering what that sound is? You alone know that I am not scared of anyone. Now the entire market will know with this sound. Broâ€¦ Just keep it in your mind I didnâ€™t come here to mess with anyone I came here to rule. I wonâ€™t compromise. Get in Pushpa! Broâ€¦ That Mangalam Srinu is coming. He is coming here to die today. Heyâ€¦ Give me the gun Hey Jakka .. you hang on, I asked Mangalam Srinu to come. If you guys fight here, the entire department will be here, and I will get everyone killed in an encounter. So Let's settle the matter here â€¦ I will leave if my brother-in-lawâ€™s body is given. You can go... but, sit first. We were like brothers right. Then What is this? You should ask them all that. It is they who have started all this. What is it about starting? It will not end till you are killed. Hey Jakka. You stop â€¦ Bro, first ask them why they sold stock to Murugan... Yes Bro. They sold the stock to Murugan without Srinannaâ€™s knowledge Jakka, shouldnâ€™t everyone stick to the syndicate? Why are you guys doing this? How much is this? - Three crores How much? How much did you sell a ton for? One and half crore. What is this? Is this true? I will give all these calculations later but what is this man? You not only killed by brother-in-law, you are also complaining against me Hey, I didnâ€™t kill your brother-in-law. I killed the person who killed Kondareddy Bro. Do you think I will sit silently and watch when someone attacks Jakkareddy bro with a knife? I shot him. You hold on man - Even I wonâ€™t leave.. I will also kill. What bro? Looks like both brothers-in-lawâ€™s are alike ... Do you think we are scared? What, you will kill? that too in front me. Why are you giving the gun? What is this? Why are you silent? Bro .. I called him when he was about to kill my brother-in-law. Still he killed him. Maybe you also called five minutes late like me. But anyways, both sides have lost right? Hey, put that gun away and first explain the calculations. Till now you said, 25 lakhs per ton.. right? Then how did he get a crore and half now? We also asked him the same Sir? Had he answered this, we wouldnâ€™t have gone to Murugan and things wouldnâ€™t have come to this This big man has screwed all of us so badly What bro Srinu? Why are you silent? Why donâ€™t you answer when MLA sir is asking you? What is this? Should I explain accounts now? Have you guys forgotten what all I did so far? True Bro. Why are you asking Srinanna accounts now? How many people did he manageâ€¦? How many check-posts he managed? Wonâ€™t you take all that into account? Hello Sir. We are coming there only. You are paying off the police. We are also paying off the police. All of you are giving commissions. Above that, we are also giving commissions we are also giving commissions to people in Forest, revenue, ID,â€¦ how will it work out? We, together should pay them once only. Then see how much will we save? Twenty-five percent. Which we were wasting. Just by bypassing Seenanna and going directly to Murugan, he paid us one and half crore. If we all unite and fix a rate, he will pay two crores at least. What? two crores?? Bro, the story doesnâ€™t stop here ... There is Chatterjee in Calcutta, and who is that in Mumbai? Ya.. Singh, then Agarwal in Delhi. I kept more people like them, in line. Bro, we have the kind of stock that is not available anywhere in the world. We have it here in Tirupati in our Andhra Pradesh. The kind that no one on this earth has. With that kind of stock we have, why should we go and ask them. We should demand and create competition amongst the buyers in the market, Then they will buy our stock standing in Queue. We may get three crores per ton also. If we go by that, our MP sir may get at least 20 crores as commission. Yes, Pushpa said it correctly, If we hand over the syndicate to a person like this, our business will be good Itâ€™s easy to speak sitting on the shore. You will know the depth when you get into the water. Pushpa Come man. Sit down and tell the whole thing to MP sir... Give me one chance, Sir. I will make sure that we see the kind of profits that we have never seen. What are you thinking Sir? Are you thinking, where is my confidence is coming from? None of the stock I have transported so far was ever caught. That is my capital. Trust me, Sir. All of you are going with him just because he sold two tons for more. Two people are also dead in the last two months since he has entered the business, just think, how many more dead bodies will we see In the coming days. What bro? do you want to believe everything this youngster said and put the business in his hands? Bro, I am not totally convinced. -If we trust him, we all will go bankrupt. Yes bro, Even Iâ€™m getting doubts Everything he did is right in front of our eyes, canâ€™t you all see it? Pushpa will manage the syndicate from now onwards. Everyone should sell their stock to Pushpa only. We will have an oath taking ceremony in Kanipakam tomorrow. Take this cash and go. MP Sir, If they give me my brother-in-lawâ€™s body, I will go home Bro, From the time you came in, you are sitting on his body only. We will send his body safely home if you get up. Hey Selva, help Seenanna in the preparations. Okay Keshava. Guys come... That side is mine... This side is mine... The piece of sky above my head is also mine That wrong is mine... This right is mine. The fire that burns the right and wrong is also me The one who can defeat me is not yet born on the earth Even If he is born, it would be me again There is only one who can grow beyond me And thatâ€™s me, myself in the future If I twirl, itâ€™s my mustache And I hold Axe in my handâ€¦ Whatever I do is the war And I never negotiate Hey Sonâ€¦ This is my bastion Hey Sonâ€¦ This is my bastion Will throw you in the lake And I return with a fish Will stick you to a pole And I hoist like a flag Will bury you in the soil and make you disappear I will be found again as an expensive ore Hey Sonâ€¦ This is my bastion Hey Sonâ€¦ This is my bastion Hey Sonâ€¦ This is my bastion Open it. What is this Draccha? It is six months since my brother died. And you are sleeping like a log since then. How can you? What should I do? That Pushpa has grown too big, and that MP is also in his side. We canâ€™t do anything till the government changes ... We canâ€™t do anything.. Then you should have waited till the government changed to send my brother to him. Did I send him to get killed? I Sent him to kill ... What should I do if he died because of his incapability? If so, you also couldnâ€™t kill him .. Then, why are you still alive? What is this Draksha? Why are you still alive? Hey you idiotic Husband â€¦ Come back if you are alive We will together take revenge.. or else I will go alone and kill him Who are you? Who are you? Iâ€™m the iron Iâ€™m the iron I will become a knife if Iâ€™m put under fire Who are you? Who are you? Iâ€™m the soil Iâ€™m the soil I will become a brick if you crush me Who are you? Who are you? Iâ€™m the rock... Iâ€™m the rock. Under these circumstances, Pushpa's marriage muhurat has been fixed. Despite lot of happenings, his mother's hope never gave up hope. To give the marriage card she went to the big house. It seems that Puspa is getting married on the 11th This is not going to happen. I will become the god for sure If you hurt me. Hey Sonâ€¦ This is my bastion Hey Sonâ€¦ This is my bastion Hey Sonâ€¦ This is my bastion Hey Sonâ€¦ This is my bastion With regret, Govindappa resigns and leaves, claiming responsibility for Bhujanga's murder Even though Jalreddy wants take revenge badly, he was not in a state to get up. Burning with vengeance, Dakshayani was left helpless.. when everyone thought that no one can touch Pushpa. The new person arrived. And the whole story changed SP...

Now the count is correct. Bagâ€¦bagâ€¦bagâ€¦ from now on, along with the cash, sir also should come. How much sir should take and how much you will get will be decided by sir. Shekhawat sir will decide. Pushpa! This is my gift for your wedding. Buy clothesâ€¦branded ones. I gave you a gift. Wonâ€™t you give me a party, Pushpa? Donâ€™t know why? Pushpa used to do whatever Shekakavat said from then onwards. He used to follow his orders religiously. Never seen Pushpa bend before anyone till then. This is the first time he was doing so. We used to wonder why he is behaving like that. That day, a little before Pushpaâ€™s wedding muhurtham, Priest called for the bridegroom. When we went in to call him, Pushpa was not there. Even his motorcycle was also not there. Wow!!â€¦ What is this Sir? What is this Sir? Never thought you have a funny side too, Sir. Singing like a Romeo.. But that day you scared me with a mask of a tiger. Had to scare Pushpa. Only then you came know how to behave with me. See now we are drinking together happily. Where is Pushpa? Where did he go? Auspicious time is nearing.. Not able to connect. Calling him -Call him again. What Pushpa? Today is your wedding, right? And you are here only. Is it ok? Sir! The wedding can happen. The bride will be there even if I go half an hour late. But you Shekhawat Sir, gave me time to meet you. What is more important than that? When you referred to the wedding, I remembered one thing. You said, you will decide when my wife should get pregnant, and at what time she should get pregnant. Why did you say that Sir? I felt very bad. Tell me why did you say that Sir? Why are you spoiling the party mood? Why all that now. Itâ€™s ok sir. You must have said that to hurt me. Thatâ€™s it, right sir? Leave it. But... I didnâ€™t like the way you insulted my mother Sir What did I say about your mother Pushpa? You know that I donâ€™t have a surname right, Sir? In spite of that, you insulted me by saying who manufactured me â€¦ who gave birth. Stamp, Stampâ€¦ thisâ€¦that. Right Sir? What is this Pushpa? Why are you spoiling the party mood? Why all that now? When someone speaks about my surname, it is like insulting my birth. And if someone insults my birth... it is like insulting my mother. Since birth every Idiot has insulted me with this, Sir. Pushpa. You are drunk and speaking nonsense. You are tipsy? Yes Sir, I had more. In your gun one thing is more. What is it? Like you, I donâ€™t know how to put in suspense saying One is moreâ€¦ There one extra bullet in that sir. In this? Yes! Give me! One, two, three, four. There are six Sirâ€¦ Did you notice it? One is more That is Service revolver Pushpa. It will have Six bullets only. That day when I tightened my fists hearing your words, you aimed this gun at me right, Sir. The bullet that had to go into this remained in this only. That one is more Do you know what this is Sir? This is my fatherâ€™s blood which is flowing in my body. My father gave me this even before my brothers could snatch the surname from me. No one can separate this from me. This... This is my brand, Sirâ€¦ Hey, Shekhawat sirâ€¦ Idiot What? did you think I am of a brand that will get scared of bullet? This brand has grown with its own attitude. Do you know why Pushpa was silent that day when you said all that? My mother didnâ€™t have a wedding in her life. This is the first wedding happening in our house. I stopped myself till this hour, thinking my mother will feel bad if anything happens. Now I wonâ€™t hold myself back. Greetings! Jakka, Sit down. Keshava, Where is Pushpa? you are not understanding what you are doing What is there to understand? I'll strip you. Take it off. Pushpa, do you know with whom you are confronting ? Bhanwar Singh. Bhanwar Singh Shekhawat Is it? Then remove your pants also Why this? Pushpa stripped Shekhawat sirâ€™s clothes and made him stand stark naked.. imagine how great feels.. Take it off. Did you understand now ? Everyone will feel the same way when you strip them. Either it is Shekhawat Sir or Pushpa. You donâ€™t have clothes on your body. I donâ€™t have clothes on my body. But there is one difference, do you know it? Pushpa started his life like this. Do you know what was his range when he was a coolie? This was his range The range that was then is the same now. See, If I go on the road like this also, they will call me Pushpa. If you go on the road like this without a police uniformâ€¦ even your dog wonâ€™t recognize you. Brand is not in the clothes you wear. It is in your living Hey Shekhawat Sir... please keep this in your mind The load that has to go will go and the money 'has to come will keep coming You wonâ€™t get a rupee. You will have just the uniform on your body but you wonâ€™t have work to do. You will only have â€˜Sirâ€™. I will remove everything else See you. (Sanskrit Sloka) Sorry, Sirâ€¦ Your dog is not recognising you. Hey, keep quiet. What, dear? What is this attire? Why did you come like this? What happened? Someone thought Pushpa means flower. I showed him that Pushpa means fire. Ok. Itâ€™s all over, right? Just started What happened sir? Pushpa! Whoever comes... Will not budge.
