I mean, before you came here. - Well, I've just sorta been traveling around places. I'm trying to find some place to stay. - So what brings you to a town like this? - Well, I don't know. Just sorta seemed like a nice place. - Nice? I don't call a town like this nice. Why don't I show you the room right now, if that's okay? - Sure. Does anyone else live here? - [Kerry] Just the two of us. My husband Geoff and me. - Oh. - Are you planning to stay long? - Well I haven't given it much thought, really. Awhile, I guess. You rent a room for awhile? I can stay awhile. - [Kerry] Have you ever rented a room from anybody before? - [Dennis] Yeah but it didn't work out. ' [KerW] What happened? - [Dennis] She died. - Oh.

Is the other room yours? - Yeah, there's just two bedrooms. - I like it. - It's not the fanciest of houses. - It's okay. - You know, Dennis, I wanna be totally honest with you. So far, you're the only person to even come to look at the room. So I guess if you're interested and you're willing. It's yours. - Oh, Well. Okay. - [Kerry] Okay? You mean you'll take it? - Yeah. - Great. I guess, make yourself at home. (eerie music) - It's good to be home. Thanks.

Any break is to be paid for in cash. - A hundred and 50? - Hey, you don't like it, go try the Holiday Inn. (faint beat music) You oughtn't let people see you do that. (chuckling) Not around here. Not with that kind of money. - Hurry up, please. - All right, all right, don't fret. Hey, once you pass through these doors, ain't nobody gonna bother you. - The room. - Sign the register. Okay.

(television commotion) Jesus Christ! (birds chirping) - Hi, babies. Geoff?! - [Geoff] What the fuck are these?! - Jesus, Geoff, you scared me to death. What're you doing with Dennis' sneakers? - Dennis? Who the fuck is Dennis? - The guy who is renting the spare room. - What? You've got some guy living here with you while I'm away? - I thought we'd agree we'd rent out the spare bedroom. - Yeah, I guess we did. But I thought you might've waited till I got home. - Look, and risk losing him? We're in no position to procrastinate, Geoff. Listen to yourself. You're not making sense. - Look, Kerry, I'm really tired. I've been on the road for the past week. I've got a splitting headache. I apologize. - I don't like the idea of someone living with us either. But we need the money. I thought that was what we agreed we'd do. - I heard voices, I was sleeping. Hi. You must be Geoff. Pleased to meet you. - Geoff, this is Dennis. - Sorry, I guess I left my sneakers in the other room. - Yeah, whatever. - I'm just making some coffee, would you like some? - Thanks. I'm gonna go out.

I haven't got all night. - Do you have some place we can go? - [Woman] You don't like it on the street? - I'm a little shy. - That'll cost you extra. Follow me. (ominous beat music) (crickets chirping) - I missed you, Geoff. Please say you don't have to go away again. (ominous music) - So, we'll get the formalities out of the way first. A20 gets oral, 50 for straight. Anything kinky is extra. - How much extra? - Depends how kinky. (distant train horn blowing) - Oh. - Oh, there's no need to be shy here. - No, no, it'sjust, well, I thought we'd try something a little more interesting. But you have to promise me to keep your eyes closed until I tell you. No, no, don't take those off. I love stockings. I really like your shoes. - You want me to close my eyes now? - Get on the bed. (ominous music) Okay. Now, I want you to tie your feet to the bed. (ominous music) (trains rails clanking) - You'll have to tie my hands. - Now, here's a rule. I'm going to your bathroom. Guess you have no objections. (chuckling) And... I don't want you to open your eyes until I come back out. And then until I say so. Okay? _ Qkay- What if I open them? - Don't. No lookie-loos. - Got it. (foreboding music) (metal clanking) Are you still there? (metal clanking) (door creaking) (eerie music) Oh Jesus.

(door thudding) (ominous music) (door creaking) - Dennis? (eerie music) (menacing music) God, you frightened me. I didn't know you were home. (thudding) - What're you looking for? - I found some blood on your towel. I thought you might have hurt yourself. - Blood? Blood. Oh, that's right. I cut myself yesterday. You see, I'm a hemophiliac and, well, it was nothing serious. Looked worse than it was. - As long as you're all right. - I'm fine. _ Qkay- I'll just wash this for you. (ominous music) (water splattering) (eerie music) What're you doing? - Just looking at the water. I like the way the light sorta plays off it. It's always moving and changing. - [Kerry] Yeah and always costing. - Sorry. So what're you gonna do today? " L\/le? I got about a million and one things to do around here. And you? Gonna chase down a job I think. - Well good luck. - Thanks. (water trickling) - Dennis. - Oh. I'm sorry. (eerie music) (man clearing throat) Good morning. - You must be our new recruit. - Dennis Skinner, that's me. - Well the dog thinks you're okay. - Is that good? - It'll do for me. - SwdL (ominous music) (whispering) (gasping) (screaming) (crying) - I can't take this anymore. (sobbing) (menacing music) (knocking) (eerie music) (suspenseful music) (metal creaking) (glass shattering) (ominous music) (creaking) (metal clinking) (foreboding music) - [Radio Announcer] Local area weather calls for mild daytime temperatures. - Damn it! (clinking) - Kerry? Oh, you cut yourself. - It's nothing, really. Why don't you just go set the table? Dinner will be ready in about 20 minutes, okay? - [Radio Announcer] Discovered late Sunday evening at Pacific Warehouse downtown. The body was found after employees at the packing plant complained about an unusual odor coming from the facility storage lockers. Authorities are refusing to speculate on whether this murder is linked to five other skinning victims along the highway. Accounts of similar attacks have been reported across the country over the past three years. (ominous music) But the authorities are now fearing to be one of the worst serial killing sprees to shock the nation. Local area traffic report. There's a Sig Alert on the north bound 87 freeway. Athree-car pileup has the number three and four lanes closed. - Simple. - Thanks, Dennis. - You're welcome. (faint radio music) Oh, oh I love this song. Come here. Come here. (smooth jazz music) It's a good song, isn't it? (chuckling) (mumbling) (giggling) (upbeat jazz music) - Dennis? - Yeah? - It's really nice to have some company. - Thanks. (upbeat jazz music) (crickets chirping) (menacing music) (phone ringing) - Hello? ' [GEOfi] Hi, Kerry. - Geoff. Where are you? What time is it? - [Geoff] Sorry to wake you. - It's four in the morning. - [Geoff] Yeah, I know. I just pulled off to get a little sleep. - What do you want? - [Geoff] I wanted to hear your voice. I wanted to tell you that I love you. (menacing music) (doorknob clicking) (water flowing) (faint screaming) (menacing music) - You've become so predictable, even after all this time. It's the beginning of the end, Skinner. You don't even know it. You won't kill me with it this time. (ominous music) (distant police sirens) (ominous beat music) - Are you following me? - Oh, kind of. (thudding) (menacing music) You've been very bad and I'm going to help you. (woman groaning) " No! - What're you doing here? - Get away from her! - Okay, that's it. It's either you or the girl. (screaming) - You coward! (Skinner laughing) Just lie still. It'll be all right. It'll be all right. (ominous music) It's all over now. (thudding) - Not until I say it's over. (woman moaning) (Skinner groaning) You're heavy. (intense buzzing) (ominous music) (liquid squelching) Can I tell you a little story about myself? I don't know if you've ever met my father. I never really liked him much. I doubt you would've. Anyway, when my mother died, he insisted on doing my mother's postmortem. Why, I don't know. Well, anyway, there I was watching my father cutting her up. Doing his slicing, doing his dicing. God, I remember it like it was happening yesterday. (sighing) And he said, he had this smile on his face, "l want you to watch this, son." And he reached over and he pulled my mother's face off. Just pulled it right off. I was pretty sick to my stomach, which you can imagine. I mean, I was six years old. What did he expect? So after he beat me up and I had time to think things over a little bit, I snuck back into the room where he did his cutting up and stuff. And I just stood there, looking at my mother's dead body for hours, dead in the box. (squelching) Well, father hadn't done such a good job of sewing her up. Like he always used to say to me, "Sewing is woman's work, son." Anyway, ljust kinda walked over to the corpse, where my mother was, and I reached down and I pulled her face right off. (huffiflg) (squelching) Just like father showed me. I then walked across to the big mirror that father used to keep in his room and I looked at myself. Except that it wasn't me looking back at me. It was my mother. And believe me, at six years old that can really freak you out. You know what I mean? (ominous music) This really is clothing for a divine soul. (wind howling) (eerie music) (dramatic music) - Why are you letting him do this to me? (glass shattering) - Come on, babe, don't feel so bad. - You got away from me tonight. But you can't run forever. Sooner or later, I'll find you and I'll kill you. Not just for me but for all the others. I'm gonna kill you. (ominous music) (engine rumbling) (Singing tune) _ H€y- Don't I even get a hello? - Hi. I didn't expect you until later. - Yeah, well, ljust couldn't keep away from you. So where's our house guest? - Still at work, I guess. - Man, I tell you, I've been working like a dog all day. You should've seen me while I was fighting, man. I could've been the heavyweight champion of the world. All I needed was good management. I would've taken Tyson out, nothing flat. He's nothing but a chump anyway. Hey, man, how come you're always smiling? - I don't know, it's good to be happy. - Yeah, that's our Dennis. He's a regular Cheshire Cat, ain't you Dennis? - [Dennis] Yeah. - You know, you remind me of those people I used to see out there in the State Hospital when I was a kid growing up. I went there to see my grandmother and I wanna tell you, you'll never see a bunch of loons grin so much. And to this day, to this day, when I think about that I still get scared. - Grinning like a loon, huh? - Hey, man, you better believe it. - And what do they say about guys with funny haircuts? - What do they say? - I don't know. I was just asking. - Don't let him bother you, Earl. - Chump! (ominous music) Hey, man, I'm telling you. I coulda knocked Tyson, man. I coulda knocked Tyson out, nothing flat. Nothing put a chump, man. (ominous music) (thudding) (screaming) (electrical buzzing) - Take me for a walk, Earl? "Yeah, baby." (ominous music) "l coulda knocked Tyson out. "L coulda knocked Tyson out, nothing flat." (laughing) - [Woman] Stop the fucking car! - Just get the hell out. Get out! Get the hell out, will you? - Fuck you! (tires screeching) Great. (ominous music) Excuse me. Hello? Hello, are you all right? - Oh. Yeah, I think so. I think I just hurt my head or something but (unsettling music) Everything's just fine. (screaming) What's the matter? Oh, oh my God, no. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Please. (yelling) - Get away from me! (screaming) (thudding) - Who do you think you are?! (ominous beat music) Fucking bitch! "Yeah, baby! "Earl's coming for you now! "Yes, sir, I'm coming to get you! "L sees you running, I starts to coming! (laughing) "Yeah! "Yeah!

"Earl ain't no hoe, little girl. "L'm gonna find you, rip the skin from behind you. (laughing) "Yeah, now when I find you, little girl, "l often like to use Mammy's recipe "which is one part hand, one part foot "and one part gizzard. (mumbling in Earl's voice) (thudding) (sniffling) "You dead, bitch!" (thudding) (laughing) (ominous music) (groaning) (mumbling in Earl's voice) (somber beat music) (dog parking) - What is it, boy? - "That's Bob." - Shelley. - "Gonna sick that lame-ass dog on me. (ominous music) "That's a little savage. "Earl Savage. "Here. doggy, doggy, dOggY- "Here. doggy, doggy, dOggY- "Come and get it." (laughing) (ominous music) - What you got for me, boy? Huh? (floor creaking) (ominous music) (floor creaking) (floor creaking) (unsettling music) (door thudding) (water trickling) (squelching) - That's right, Earl. Who's smiling now? (laughing) (water trickling) (door creaking) (water sloshing) - Dennis? You in there? Dennis, are you in there? (unsettling music) - That's all you're having? - Yeah. - Here, you can have this. I gotta get an early start. - Aren't you gonna eat first? Geoff, I know things aren't going well for you but you're never here and when you are all we do is fight. - You don't think I know that? Look, Kerry, if I had another job, if I made more money, I wouldn't be away from you all the time. - Good morning. How're you doing, big guy? Boom, boom, boom, boom. I think it's gonna be a good day today. Don't you think? - Yeah? What's gonna be so fucking good about it? - Well, I don't know. - Later, chief. - Will you excuse me for a minute? How could you treat him like that? He's our house guest whether you like it or not. ' [GEOfi] Exactly! I don't like it. - You don't like it? You'd not even gonna be here. You're gone all next week. I'm the one that has to live here. - Exactly! You're living with him. - And what's that supposed to mean? - Just forget it. - I can't believe you'd even think that! Just get out of here! (engine rumbling) - Morning, Bob. Where's the dog? - Sick. Some bastard laid out some poison meat for him. I got it off him before he ate most of it but it's too late. - My God. That's terrible. Any idea who did it? - Not yet. I got a surprise for them if they try anything like that again. - Yeah? What do you got? - This will show them. - Hey, don't go pointing that at me. - I won't. Unless I have to. - Whoa, okay. See you, Bob. - Hey, Dennis? You seen Earl around? Kinda worried. Hasn't been in a couple of days and I went around his place last night. He wasn't there. - Well I wouldn't worry about old Earl. Heck, you know him. He could be right under our noses and we wouldn't know it. - Yeah. I guess you're right. - See ya, Bob. (ominous music) (door thudding) (creaking) (ominous music) (door creaking) (faint television commotion) (door closing) - Hi, Kerry. How was your day today? - Same old story. Just me sitting around feeling sorry for myself. - Yeah. Anything I can do to help? - Not unless you got a magic wand. - Right. - Look, if you don't mind, I think I'm just gonna go to bed. I'm suddenly feeling a little tired. _ Qkay- - Goodnight. - Goodnight. - [Kerry] Goodnight. (ominous music) (water trickling) - Always changing its shape. Maybe it's time to try. (menacing music) (wind howling) (door creaking) (ominous music) (water trickling) Okay, okay, okay. Kerry, I just wanted to tell you that the other night was really beautiful but maybe now isn't the right time for us, you know? I know things will work out for us sometime but I think, first, maybe you should get to know the real me. (foreboding music) - You're a creature of habit, Skinner. Your time has come. (thudding) (whimpering) - So this is the guy who's getting you so worked up. Poor girl. (ominous music) - [Heidi] What're you doing in here? - Been worried about you. Where have you been? - Get out of here. - I've been waiting for you. - Don't touch me. - Come on, don't be like that. (chuckling) I want you. Why so surprised, huh? You're a very attractive woman. - Where did you get that? - Tucked away in your bible, remember? Like I said, you're a very attractive woman. - That's not me. She died a long time ago. She died and I was born. Give it to me! - What will you give me? - Please just stop it! - I want you and I'm gonna have you. - Get away from me! - Whoa, whoa, what the fuck? I don't know what you got in there, just keep that shit away from me! - I just want you to get out of here. - So why you so desperate to get this guy, huh? - That's my business. You don't know anything about it. - Oh yeah? I know the one thing that you don't. I know where he's staying. ' HOW? You don't even know him. - I don't need to know him but I followed you around tonight when you went down to the river. You seemed so interested in him. So I decided to follow him. See what it is he's got that I haven't. - You know where he is? Tell me. - Just like that but nothing in return? - If you don't tell me, I'll kill you. - Come on, be reasonable. Go ahead, kill me. Then you'll never find out. Come on. Don't be so modest. I know what you're like. I've seen you. - Do you still want me? - Why not? Just put that away. - You have to tell me. - [Eddie] l will. Just relax. - You have to tell me now. (humming tune) - Dennis? (ominous music) Dennis? (wind howling) - I wanted you to see the real me. (eerie music) (screaming) (ominous music) (gasping) (somber beat music) (door creaking) (engine rumbling) (birds chirping) (birds squawking) (eerie beat music) _ Hey, Kerry? Who are you? What're you doing here? - I'm looking for Dennis Skinner. Who are you? - You're in my house! How the hell did you get in here? Kerry? Hey, Kerry? Kerry? Kerry? (ominous beat music) - [Heidi] Who are you looking for? - My wife. - Read it to me. - Itjust says "sorry." This isn't Kerry's writing. What do you know about this? - Tell me where to find him. - He's run away with my wife, I wanna know about it. - If Dennis has your wife, I don't think they will have run away together. - What're you talking about? You obviously know him, tell me what's going on. - You don't wanna know. - Don't fuck with me! You're talking about my wife! Now you tell me! - I'll find him myself. - You're not going anywhere until you fucking tell me what's going on! - If he has your wife, then it's probably too late already. Tell me where he goes. He never strays far once he settles. - What're you talking about? - I've been hunting him for five years and I don't suppose I was the first. This is what he did to me. (eerie music) - Jesus Christ. - This all of me. This is what he'll do again ifl don't stop him, so I want you to tell me. Where does he go? What does he do? I said tell me. - I don't know. He works in a factory. He's a janitor or something, he cleans. I don't know. - Where? Where?! - I don't know. - You're wasting my time. (screaming) (thudding) (groaning) Get up! You're gonna take me to where you saw him. - Yeah? And what if I refuse? - Don't. (menacing music) - You know, when people first meet they often say to themselves, "Okay, here is a nice, lovable guy." And that's how I like to present myself, as a nice, lovable guy. Not as some sort of freak. It's just that, you know what, it's difficult to be in that house with you and him and know how much he means to you and everything. It's just rough for me. It's very rough, you know what I mean? (engine rumbling) (booming) - [Bob] What in the hell is that? (ominous music) (breaks squeaking) (ominous beat music) - I know what you and Geoff think of me. I know you guys are always talking behind my back about me and everything. I know I sound kinda funny looking and whatever but (thudding) I don't really care, it's okay. - Please don't hurt me. - It's blood. It leads in there. You'll need this. - Here. (groaning) Jesus. What the hell was that? - I told you. Dennis Skinner is mine. _ H€y- Hey, wait a minute. You can't do this to me! - I already have. - Oh, shit. (ominous music) - You do kinda talk about me behind my back. That's okay and everything. In fact, one person I used to know at the institution, was talking behind my back but I took care of him. Do you talk about me behind my back? I'm asking you a question. Do you understand what I'm saying? It's a yes or a no, do you understand what I'm saying? Do you agree with me that you and Geoff were talking about me behind my back? - No. - Don't fucking lie to me! You talk behind my back! L'll fucking kill you! (meta creaking) Huh? - I finally found you. (ominous music) - Heidi, stay away from my tools. You know how much I hate that. Feel about that, you just know. You know it bugs me. You know it bugs me. (clinking) So why do you do it? - What're you doing here? (groaning) You all right? - Please. Please, help. - Oh my God. (eerie music) (Dennis moaning) (metal clinking) (gasping) - Look out! (Dennis laughing) Please cut me down. (groaning) (ominous music) - Skinner! (fire crackling) (suspenseful music) - You got my damn dog but you're not gonna get me. (eerie music) (ominous music) (Dennis laughing) - [Heidi] Skinner! (slicing) (thudding) (groaning) - [Bob] What the hell? (gunshots booming) (screaming) (booming) (gunshots booming) (screaming) - [Kerry] Don't shoot me! Don't! (Kerry crying) - Does it hurt? Good. - It's felt better. - Now you know how we felt. - Look at you, lying there. Your guts hanging out of your back and your cheap, pea green, flea market bargain basement coat. (groaning) You know what they're gonna do to me? They love people like me. They're gonna bring me in, do some tests on me, maybe. And then, a few years from now, maybe, when I get bored and through biding my time, they're gonna let me go. (chuckling) You know why? They love people like me. They'll think I'm cured. Doesn't that make you wanna scream? Huh? Doesn't it make you wanna scream? Scream? (laughing) Doesn't it just make you wanna rip a good one out? (screaming) (intense rock music) (intense rock music) (intense rock music)
