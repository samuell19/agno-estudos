Roga, return the Sacred Dragon Stone! It looks like it's going to be noisy. Where are you going, Roga? It is the fate of the Hiruko... to live and die in the shadows. It's not too late yet. You won't be punished... if you return the Sacred Dragon Stone. We shall have that Dragon Stone! Who are you? This is getting to be a nuisance. Can't take this anymore. What a noise! Here! Don't waste your energy. You can't get away. III ask one more time. Who are you? I don't know. I see. Then die! How does he taste, my kids? Don't waste a piece. Eat it all. Mozuku... No time to worry about others. I want you to be our meal. What? How wonderful, wonderful! I am delighted your fight seems to be over so quickly. Once you are done, get lost, please! I am sleepy. I was having a nice dream. Then this clink, clink, clang, clang woke me up. First, you! What's the matter? You can't get me unless I'm in the range of your sword! With my sword, that's not necessary! Magai? Heard about you. With a gust of energy through his sword... who defeats his opponent, a mercenary ninja. I believe your name is Jubei Kibagami. It must be a strange fate to have met you here. Would you be willing to work for me? Of course, I will pay. - I decline. - Why? You are, after all, a mercenary ninja. Don't you work for money? Yeah, that's right. But I don't trust a guy who doesn't show his face. Where are you going, Jubei? Nowhere. I just want to see the rest of my dream. Mozuku was defeated. Who killed Mozuku? Not Roga? I see. Kimon clan. Kimon ninjas working for Yamikubo. The Light Maiden is in danger! She's in danger! Magai was killed. Let's go, Doten. The Light Maiden is in danger. Yesterday and again, today... I haven't had much luck. Miss Shigure, we are ready for a practice session. Yes. - You know, Genza... - Yes? I have never been out of this village... not since I was born. I wonder what's out there! Well, I don t really know myself. I see. Come on! Fight! Ready! Ouch! How many times do I have to tell you?! Don't close your eyes! Y... yes! I don't care who... someone defeat me! We are in no state of fighting back. We can't protect our village in case of any attack. You are right. Genza always treats me like a child. But I'm... Trespasser! Miss Shigure? Who are you? What's the matter? What a dangerous place. Look what you He got in the middle of this. Did it hit him? I don't know. Just got a little lost. I'd appreciate it if I can get a drink of water. All right. Come with me. Don't worry. After I get some rest, I'm out of here. Tell me something. What is it? I know nothing but this village. I want you to tell me, traveler... what is out there in the world? What is different from here? Not much. Anywhere you go, people are people... the sky is the sky. Nothing's different. I m... What's that? Maybe it was someone trying to catch a baboon with a cannon. Be serious! I am getting tired of this. I guess someone doesn't want me to sleep. Mr. Genza! I'm afraid this is our fate. The Light Maiden! The Light Maiden! Miss Shigure, please run away! Quick! Go! Go! You guys, keep eating, eat them all! Hey, you better get out of here. Don't insult me! I... I will... I can... You guys! Please, Miss Shigure, please run away. We will take care here. Quick! Are you a village guard man? I have nothing to do with this village. I am just passing by. That's fine. This is some kind of fate. I hate this fate. Genza? Genza? Where shall I run to? What shall I do, Genza? Go to the outside world which you wish to see. I will take you. No! Run, quick! Go, quick! Run away! Quick! Miss Shi... gu... re! What's your name? Jubei Kibagami. Mother! Don't die! What'll happen to us if you die! Jubei... Kibagami. You said you wouldn't trust someone... - who hides his face... - Yeah. This is my face. I beg you. I want you to give this to that girl. Are you sure you want to trust me with this? I am a mercenary ninja who works for money. Yes, I trust you. If not, I will haunt you. The... Light... Maiden.
