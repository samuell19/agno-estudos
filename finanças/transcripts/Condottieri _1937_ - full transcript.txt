Condottieri Subject and direction Co—directors To the realization of this ﬁlm have largely collaborated units of the Armed Forces of the State This ﬁlm is a loose reenactment of the time and spirit of the Italian Condottieri, who, in the ardent background of the Renaissance, for the ﬁrst time headed the civilian militias of the People that stood against mercenaries and troops of fortune, having as aim the unity of the Italian homeland. It's held us back for two months! We will not get to Rome in time for the Consistory! Milady. May I leave here little Maria? 80 Salviati will be more reassured. Hallowed be thy name. Thy kingdom come. Will you come with me? - No! - Come on. - No, I don't want to come! Don't be afraid. - No, let me! No, no! No. Cesare... The day will come that your actions will be judged! But it‘s not about conquering or not the castle! I know we will. But when? Here he is. Bravo! A good blow! And now that we have in our hands the son of Caterina, what shall we do with him? Make him disappear! Don't you think that, as hostage, he may be valuable? That little toad? I might deal with the mother the surrender of the fortress. You're sly, Danielo. You will go far! Pity, the woman is beautiful. But dangerous! Go! Haughty, prideful, rich in glory and prowess, a great condottiero will come among us. And a magniﬁcent eagle, above the earth and the sea, will stretch its wings soaring up in ﬂight. But the cunning fox will be dangerous. Brava! And whose verses are these? - A great condottiero... But it can't be but you! And who is the cunning fox? - The cunning fox... the cunning fox... But it's the cardinal! And now I want to know who is the magnificent eagle. The cunning fox... Go to milk the cows! - Bring the goats to pasture! Do the farmer, not the soldier! But you could at least try, right? - With you?! Who bear the sword like a broom? Where did you steal this chain? Huh? This chain, is untouchable! But no, troublemaker! I meant to shake your hand! Bravo, Pedro! This bad lot has the makings of a good soldier! Come on, drink up! Come. Malatesta wants you. So it's you who quarrels with my soldiers, huh? Well! Men like you, I hire them. What's the pay? - I don't need any pay! I am Giovanni de' Medici, son of Caterina! - Caterina? Caterina and her son have fallen under the dagger of the Borgias! Furthermore, their strongholds are now lost. My last stronghold, Captain, is in here! Well! Stay with me. I will entrust you some feats. Tomorrow we'll assault a Mantuan convoy. Then we're going to ﬁght for Florence. Pays better than Bologna. Go! That man has magnificent eyes! They have something... - I wonder if one day I shouldn't get them off. And if he was truly the Duke? - Duke? But don't you see he's a peasant? Stop the horses! Stop! Stop the horses! - Stop! Come on! Grab him! And Giovanni? Where is Giovanni? There he is! Hey, Giovanni! Here! Hey, Giovanni! - Giovanni! Hey, Giovanni! Comrade! Come here! Hey, what are you doing standing there? Come here! Well? What's the matter? I killed a man who hadn't done me any harm, and who was of my land. And you are upset for this?! Are we or are we not soldiers? We must kill! And that is called being soldiers? We obey Malatesta. He is the chief, and... Malatesta is a chief of brigands, who only thinks of killing, and stealing! And you're worthy of him! If we want to be together, we must change course of action. You saw your man with beautiful eyes, huh? He got away! And he brought with him four of my best soldiers. And you still believe he's a peasant, now? What are you trying to say? - l? Nothing! It's the soldiers that say he's Caterina's son. - Stop it, you fool! With these idiotic chatter! Here's the castle! You know the watchword? - Me? No. And how do we get in? Look at those carts. | get it. Come on. Stop! Where to? To the castle. You can't pass by here. But the captain of the castle awaits us. Without watchword, no one passes through here. So... Come on! The word... is 'Barbican'. Come on. Grinder. Sharpen. Nice! - And that the job be well done. - Yes. The knife is of our Most Excellent overlord. Soon we'll get it. Those of the New Gate are all with us. It took you quite a while, huh? Ready. Nice job you've done! Now you're in for it! Come bring him yourself! Let's go! Come on! Give it to me. Wait here. Look what this man did to your dagger! Hey, you! Come here. You know I can make break your bones? But, I don't understand! - Oh, you don't? Look at this! Do you think I can still make use of this knife? I believe it can still be used... and well. Are you crazy? I am the rightful lord of this castle that you stole from my mother! And that I'm taking back! I let you free on condition that you waive your false rights, and leave the castle today. Hurray for Giovanni! Long live Giovanni! Hey! Where are you going with all those sheep? Towards the mountains. In summer we bring them there. I too come from the mountains. Greet them for me. Yes. Farewell. But is it true that Giovanni asked you to reassure the Republic on his devotion? Yes. You claim he's a Medici. Are you sure? Our researches prove it. He is son to Caterina. It is false! You were deceived! - Give me free hand! l'll ﬁx this impostor who betrayed our ﬂag! | always argued that the offspring of Caterina should be destroyed! I had arranged things in such way. - You intrigued me about this individual. Have him come to Florence! He will answer for his actions before the Council. He won't come! - It's impossible! We shall see! Hello! - What's up, guys? Nino, you must recruit soldiers for our cause. Come! - Here I am! You also have to do me a favor. Find Maria. - Who is Maria? The daughter of of my mother's castellan. She disappeared when we were driven out of the castle, and since then I haven't known anything. - But how will I ﬁnd her’? Maria should remember the song that my mother sang to us children, and that you know well. # Stay and listen to this melody, # # that I may ﬁnd you, Maria! # # Always sighs, my soul, # # thy name: Maria! # Bravo! Go! And sing it wherever you go. Only Maria will be able to respond. Well, Captain. - Goodbye. And remember to bring many soldiers! - All right. and therefore, you are accused of rebellion to the Holy Mother Church. I am not a heretic! Of robbery! What robbery? I took what was mine by right! Of desertion! | abandoned Malatesta, because his is a war by brigands! Of cowardice! Anyone who doubts my courage, come fon/vard. I won't ﬁght with a traitor. You spoke of a great and united homeland. What do you mean? Italy. One single state, from the Alps to the sea. Give me your conﬁdence. With your help, I can create it. Rome, Florence, Venice, and perhaps even Genoa, united in one state! But there is no common sense! Delusions of grandeur! Rebellion! - He's crazy, he doesn't reason! To accomplish what I and others want, you must dare! It takes a heart and a faith, and not your reasoning. Heart... ! Let him go, this visionary... will never be dangerous. You're free. Go ahead, run behind your dreams. But remember not to commit impulsive and arbitrary acts. In the name of the Republic, and of the Holy Church, I command you to respect, in all circumstances, our common interests. Go. Letting him free like that... It's not possible! # The land, however, they had to leave, # # and dn'fted apart with great sorrow. # # They wandered about, through mountains and towns # # lamenting lost all their goods. # # And the song of faith, each one repeated, # # remembering a time far away... # # Stay and listen to this melody, # # that I may ﬁnd you, Maria! # # Always sighs, my soul, # # thy name: Maria! # # Rataplan, rataplan, the great Captain, # # wants to liberate our country, to unify it. # # Rataplan, rataplan, of his enemies the vain # # pride he will be able to repress. # # And which of you has the heart of Italian, # # to his ﬂag will come rushing! # # Rataplan, rataplan, with the great Captain, # # I ﬁght to liberate the homeland. # # Rataplan, rataplan, with the great Captain, # # I ﬁght to liberate the homeland. # In the name of God Almighty, In the name of God Almighty, I swear to believe in the ultimate goal of an Italy great and united, to obey the orders of my leader, to serve with all my might, and to the last drop of blood, the sacred cause of homeland. I swear! What is it? Something important? We go from bad to worse! Young people ﬂock more and more under Giovanni's banner. Soon he will be stronger than us. - Stronger than us? Nonsense! And he leaves them almost without food! - We must act! What do you recommend? I think I can solve the issue. Go now. Nice! Did you hear? You see? You believed him a fool! You wouldn't take him seriously. Instead... You're right. You're always very smart. Tullia... would you make yourself useful to the Council of the Republic? I have a graceful task for you. What should I do? Giovanni... He will enjoy a lot your visit. Poison him? It's a solution! We must get rid of that mad dog! I'm counting on you. You like it? | eat simply, as a soldier, but it's healthy. I'm not as spoiled as you think. There is still something? Yes. Some fruit. - Thank you. Malatesta knows that you're here? - Yes. And he had no objection? - It was he who sent me to you. Strange! But then, why... - Shall we drink to? To who? - To your simplicity. To your beauty! What's this? A small gift for you. Malatesta? I'll never forget, Tullia. Oh, you too will forget, like everyone else. You saved my life. Why? What is it? - Tomorrow will there be muster? Sure. And that everything is in order! Florence will ﬁnally see true militias! Each of you take command of a company. How many men do we have? 200 knights, 400 infantry. Alright. What wonderful soldiers! And faithful! Of course they cost me a lot of money, but... Long live our condottiero! That dog is spoiling us the profession of arms! Shafts on the ground! Right face! They're many, and very ordered. Are they really all volunteers? - Bah! A bunch of fanatics that we must stop before it's too late. If you don't take advantage of this opportunity to seize him, he will crush us all. One would say that you're afraid. - I? It's notjust my head that is at stake, don't forget. Giovanni, don't go. I'm scared. How beautiful you are today! Will you ﬁnally give up on your ideas of rebellion? No! Enough! Enough! Be silent! Listen. Your ideas tempt and upset the people. For the last time, will you and your militias submit to Malatesta, the one and only condottiero of the Republic? No! Never! And then, in the name of the Council, and of the people of Florence, I accuse you of high treason. | ask you to refer the matter to the Holy Father. Be he judge and arbiter. Do not worry about it. We'll take care, to inform the Holy Father. Humble yourself, lest you be struck by the banishment! Do not forget that my soldiers are waiting in the square. By order of the Grand Council, the Black Bands are disbanded. Giovanni is in our hands. The slightest gesture of rebellion on your part, means instant death for him. Comrades, the Council sends us home. - Where is Giovanni? Betrayed! And imprisoned. On horseback! Flags to the left! Fonivard! You haven't yet learned what is discipline? Come on! Your cause is lost. You now recognize Cesare as legitimate lord of your castle and of your possessions? No! Never! Don't forget that the Council has means that will force you to obey. It's infamy! You disown me and my people for fear of your personal interests. Of me, you can do what you want. Throw me in jail, kill me... But for one of us that is killed, a thousand will arise to ﬁght for our idea! Here's one. He too was there. After hearing the charges brought by the Council of Florence to Giovanni dei Medici, called the Great Devil, the Holy Father threatens him of interdict if he does not show up in Florence humbled and repentant. For having rebelled, the said Giovanni, against the laws of the State, for being perjurer and traitor, the Council and the Pontiff threaten to declare lost all his goods. Cursed bel... the one who will give him help or asylum, water for his thirst, food for his hunger. Amen! Have you heard? They want me to return to Florence. - Yes, huh? - And you will go? Yes. But not as they think! There is nothing more to be done. Who's not ready to die for his faith, is not worthy to profess it! Oh yes? Alright... But what should we do? You, go back to Florence with Corrado. Prepare for my return. Soon we'll settle the score! Come on. But we know each other! Haven't we met before? Wasn't it you, last year, ﬁshing by the river bank? Yes. That's me. But that one, however, was a knight! Yeah! We are a little battered, right? Oh, I didn't mean that. May we come with you? Sure, come along. By now the border is not too far. Soon we will be safe. Yes. And once beyond, we will enlist with the French soldiers. Soldiers? Still soldiers! As if we didn't have enough! Meanwhile, to gain time. The rest, we'll think of later. Maria! Captain Villon. I am told that you know Italy well, and especially Florence surroundings. Is it true? - Yes, Captain. You already fought in that area? - Yes, Captain. - Well! Then you will be our guide. It seems that Malatesta is in difﬁculties. Do you know Malatesta? I've heard of him. We shall leave from Grenoble. Little St. Bernard Pass, Turin. Pavia, Bologna... Through this pass, we'll descend to Florence. And once arrived, where should I be? We will be guests of the Duke of Florence. You will know the rest later. Discord! Slavery! All the evils hang over us. The stranger is in your homes! ls eating your food! Sleeps in your beds! And you, instead of taking action, you are inert, prey to the temptations of the devil! And this, because you have wandered from the kingdom of God. But a lightning will come down on you and will destroy you! Among your enemies, 0 Italy, they will make mock of you! And they will sing songs about you, if any man will not dare to stand up and take action! It is a shame that none of us moves! - Shut up! Things will change. - Yes, even Giovanni had promised it. It is a year already that we are in these conditions. To me, he sold himself. Stupid! And if Giovanni were already in Florence? Maria, I must leave you now. Don't fear. Pedro is here with other friends. - What should I do? Take this mask, make sure you dance with Malatesta. The rest will follow. Who is that beautiful blonde girl? She must be here with D'Argentiere. It seems she's in his retinue. Who is it? - Well, I do not know her. You allow? Will you grant me this dance? Tullia. But where have we met? - Here, in Florence. Didn't you save my life, once? Giovanni? Me, Tullia. But what a recklessness, coming here! - Why? What might happen to me? Now I am with D'Argentiére, a guest of the Republic. And now, will you grant me a dance? Malatesta is very perturbed. - He has forgotten his old love! It's always like that. But Duke, I think that even Tullia is well comforted. And who is her partner? - I don't know. - It's my aide, Captain Villon. I need your help. Whole Florence will be at your feet. I have to ﬁght with Malatesta. You can't ask me that. You're right. It is better that I act alone. Who did it? I! So what? You will give me satisfaction! No! Do not kill him! Florence is ours! Hurray for the Black Bands! To Rome! Fonivard! Victory! Giovanni! Finally... peace has returned. We will make a clean sweep of Giovanni, of his Bands, and of his dreams. D'Argentiere! - Bien! But you must respect the pacts and the rights of my king on Pavia and Milan. Robbery and looting! My Lansquenets don't ask for better! But remember the 3,000 crowns you promised me. All I want is to see wave my ﬂag on Giovanni's castle, and to do away with him! I'm ready for anything! How many men do you have? - 12,000, and well armed. 3.000 Lanzi who fear nor devil nor hell. With my 9.000 we'll be three times higher! Long live our alliance! - Hurray! Your orders have been executed. Everything is ready. Well! We leave immediately. Maria... I must go. But do not worry. I shall return. Fomardl Forward! - Come on! Victory! Victory! Fonivard! Victory! Fonivard! Come on! The captain is wounded! The captain is dead! - Everything is lost! Giovanni! What happens? - You're wounded, our men give way! Fon/vard! Hold on! Take it back! Hold on! To me! Giovanni calls us! Follow me! - Counter-charge! Hold on! Fon/vard! Giovanni!
