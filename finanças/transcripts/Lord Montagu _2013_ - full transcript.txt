(male narrator) If we were talking about you or talking about me, being into history would mean studying it and getting out a book and learning and reading about things. Lord Montagu was born into history of the Montagu family in this place. It's not a subject that he's keen on. It's his life.

It was a great event for the Montagu family and his father in particular because he'd waited a very long time for a male heir to his estate at Beaulieu. And it said that in celebration, the swans on the Beaulieu River all rose up as one, flew into the sky. (Fred Norris) It was the joy of the place. When we were in school, we were given badges to wear in the lapels of our coats. On the green surround, were the initials, Edward John Barrington Douglas Scott Montagu. (Ann Chichester) It was great excitement. It was you see, all us girls and no son and heir for Beaulieu, so it was very special that suddenly my father and mother had a son. (Mary Clare Horn) We were all brought up at Palace House, which you can imagine is a wonderful place to be and we had all the garden, we had the river, we had sea and it was just one, big happy family. We were very, very lucky. We didn't realize how lucky we were. (Oliver Tobias) &quot;In March 1929, my father died, age 62. &quot;I was just two and a half years old. ♪ &quot;I treasure it, to this day... but it is the photo of a father I never knew.&quot; (Susan Tomkins) After he died in 1929, things became quite difficult. Lord Montagu was two and a half years old at the time. The estate was put into trust for him, to inherit on his 25th birthday. (Ralph Montagu) At the time he became Lord Montagu of Beaulieu at age two and a half, I don't suppose he even understood what the title meant and as he was growing up, he would no doubt have been told, &quot;Well, one day all this will be yours.&quot; (Oliver Tobias) &quot;My inheritance would be 10,000 acres &quot;of unspoiled countryside on the southern coast of England, known as Beaulieu.&quot; &quot;In 1204, King John granted the land to the Cistercian Monks &quot;and it was they who created this great landscape. &quot;Located in the heart of the New Forest, there are &quot;2,000 acres of woodland, five miles of seashore, and eight and a half miles of river.&quot; &quot;And at the center, lies Palace House, &quot;a 13th Century stately home. &quot;This estate had been carefully nurtured, preserved &quot;and passed down from generation to generation and now, it was entrusted to me.&quot; (Lord Montagu) Having inherited the title at the age of two and a half, I can never remember a time when I was not aware of my privileged position. As little Lord Montagu, I was always giving away prizes at ploughing matches or officially turning on new water supplies on the estate, or being photographed with the Bishop, or raising the flag on Empire Day. And as I grew older, my responsibility towards the estate increased. Even as a child, I felt it was a sacred trust to conserve my inheritance and to hand it over as intact as possible to future generations. (airplanes flying) (radio announcer) There were more German planes over the coast of Britain today than at anytime since the war began. (Oliver Tobias) &quot;The most obvious collision between the outside world &quot;and the enclosed one of childhood &quot;was the coming of World War II. &quot;By the early 1940s, everything, from the pristine countryside to &quot;the main thoroughfares of London had been hit by German bombs.&quot; &quot;In 1945, the war was finally over, &quot;but the destruction of our country's heritage &quot;would continue. &quot;All across England, hundreds of our nation's stately homes were &quot;being destroyed and my home in Beaulieu was in jeopardy. ♪ ♪ (Sir Roy Strong) During the 50s, one great house a week was either abandoned, purposely demolished or blown up. It just went on and on and on. (Ralph Montagu) The years that followed the war were a very difficult one for the owners of stately homes. A lot of things were against them. Costs were rising very significantly. The repair bills had to be met, but the money that the owners owned was taxed to the point which there was nothing left. (Oliver Tobias) &quot;When I formally inherited Beaulieu, age 25, &quot;I was informed the estate was nearly insolvent. &quot;The post-war depression had dried up &quot;much of the country's wealth. Maintaining a large historic house seemed nearly impossible.&quot; Everything was really depressed. Everything, and so stately homes' sort of lovely idea of golden minarets and so on, just wasn't on the agenda. (Simon Howard) People looked at these houses and thought, &quot;Well how are we going to keep these houses up &quot;if we want to keep them in the family. What are going to do with them?&quot; A lot of houses demolished, a huge amount. (Oliver Tobias) &quot;During the 1950s, more than 1,500 stately homes &quot;were destroyed in what became known as the destruction of the country house.&quot; (Sir Roy Strong) The country house in England is really one of its great cultural glories, absolutely one of the central English creations. (Oliver Tobias) &quot;Primarily built between the 16th and 19th century, &quot;the stately homes of England served as some of the &quot;largest employers of the area and entire local economies once flourished from their land.&quot; &quot;Influences from Baroque to Renaissance, their architecture &quot;and beautiful landscape parks, are a reflection of England's unique history.&quot; (Sir Roy Strong) England is not about the sea. It's about land and the focal point of that was the great house. It was the center of civilization, culture, style, wonderful gardens, all the great artists and architects are represented in the country house. (Lord March) One is trying to maintain a very important part of the national heritage and at one's own expense and sometimes that's impossible. ♪ (Oliver Tobias) &quot;I considered giving my home to the National Trust &quot;or turning it into flats or a hotel. &quot;I could have sold it all and spent the rest of my life &quot;on a beach in the Bahamas, but deep down, I knew this was unthinkable.&quot; He knew he was the most recent in a long line of owners, so to sell it and give up that would have been a complete betrayal to the rest of the family. (Murray Walker) He is a nobleman and frankly, in Britain, you don't necessarily expect noblemen to be good at anything other than being a nobleman. You don't expect them to be good businessmen. (coin drops in slot) (Lord Montagu over speaker) This is Lord Montagu of Beaulieu speaking and I welcome you to Beaulieu. You are now standing in the cloisters of Beaulieu Abbey. Nearby is the Parish Church. (narrator) Beaulieu is one of the most recent houses to be open to the public and the gatehouse chambers have been turned into a museum. The normal man or woman in the street wouldn't normally get access to seeing such grandness. With all the beautiful paintings, whether they be in Van Gogh or Ginsburg, all these sculptures that they had, all the magnificent furniture they had, all the carpets and tapestries which were suddenly, the stately homes opened, Lord Montagu's was one of them. (James Harvey-Bathurst) The draw of these houses were, they were enormous, they were behind walls, they were secret and people wanted to know how the aristocracy lived. (Sir Roy Strong) So there was a kind of curiosity value about this semi-extinct breed, actually emerging from their houses and doing things which seemed to be perfectly normal. (Nick Mason) There was a change. Everyone had to make a living. They couldn't just live off the inherited wealth and if they were going to preserve it, they had to work really hard to do that. (James Harvey-Bathurst) Edward was not frightened of drawing in the visitors, talking about his house. He was very gregarious. (Murray Walker) And I think above all, relating to the people that came. I mean, he went up there and greeted and met the people. And he's a showman. Edward is a showman at heart. (Ralph Montagu) There's a great picture of my father on his hands and knees, scrubbing the floor at Palace House and this was in the papers, just before the house opened to the public, but there's little doubt that this was set up. First of all, I don't think he would have scrubbed the floor himself. Second, it was a wooden floor and who scrubs wooden floors? He always laughed at that photo, because you don't wash a wooden floor. He made this much, much bigger than it would otherwise have been. It was his personality that drove it. (Oliver Tobias) &quot;In our very first year of opening Palace House &quot;to the public, we had over 70,000 visitors, &quot;more than double my most optimistic predictions. The future looked set.&quot; &quot;In 1954, my life changed.&quot; The whole aspect of the trial was an absolute nightmare. Well, what everybody knows, but I don't find it something I want to talk about. Not as a family, we never talk about it. My father never really talked to me about the trial. I got the slightest, and I do mean slightest inklings in my teenage years that something strange and horrible happened to him. The Montagu trials were the biggest gay trials, the biggest gay event, since the trials of Oscar Wilde at the end of the 19th century. It's got everything. It's got society. It's got intrigue. It's got glamour. It's got sex. It really does allow the press to go to town and tell this amazing story. Homosexuality in Britain in the 1950s was totally illegal, whether in private or in public. The most common offense was gross indecency, which carried a sentence of up to two years hard labor. (Ralph Montagu) In his book, my father makes it clear that he has always been attracted to both sexes. (Oliver Tobias) &quot;I could see this was by no means unusual &quot;and realized I was not alone. &quot;I liked the company of girls and I enjoyed going to bed &quot;with them, but I could not deny that I sometimes &quot;felt much the same about men. &quot;In retrospect, I do see that I was bound to be caught in a clash of cultures.&quot; ♪ There were two trials. The big one, the most infamous one, was in 1954, but there was one before that, which really started the whole process off in late 1953 when a group of Boy Scouts were staying at Beaulieu to act as guides in the house during a busy period. (Dr. Matt Houlbrook) The Count of Montagu, he goes to a beach hut on his estate at Beaulieu to look for a camera that had been stolen. (Oliver Tobias) &quot;My brand new 16 millimeter cine camera had gone missing, &quot;so I decided to search for it in my beach hut &quot;a few miles away. &quot;I asked if any of my house guests would like &quot;to accompany me for a swim and search for the camera. &quot;Kenneth Hume, who was a friend and a local film maker, and two of the four Boy Scouts agreed to come along.&quot; The Count of Montagu and Hume, the whole visit to the beach hut was completely innocent, but they went to the beach hut and then took a swim while they were there and simply got changed in separate rooms. The two Boy Scouts, by contrast, even though they changed their stories, the stories that they told to the police on a number of different occasions, the two Boy Scouts alleged that they'd been sexually assaulted. (Oliver Tobias) &quot;At the committal proceedings, it was unnerving &quot;to hear a 14 year old Boy Scout assert categorically, &quot;that I had taken sexual advantage of him. &quot;It was even more shocking because it was described &quot;by the boy in graphic detail, smiling as he gave his verbal evidence.&quot; The court was not persuaded by the demeanor of the boys, which was slightly jokey. The two Boy Scouts contradicted themselves on so many occasions that the veracity of their evidence was undermined. Now, there is some attempt to bring medical evidence of an indecent assault, but that in itself is inconclusive. Throughout the trial period, the person that my father most confided in was his elder sister, Elizabeth and some years later, I interviewed her and asked her to tell me what she remembered. (Elizabeth speaking on tape) (Elizabeth speaking on tape) (Oliver Tobias) &quot;In the end, the jury did not believe the scouts' testimony and I was cleared of the principal charges.&quot; He was free and I'm sure he felt the worst was behind him. Unfortunately, in the new year, another bombshell hit. ♪ (Oliver Tobias) &quot;At 8 AM, on the 9th of January, 1954, the police arrived at Palace House.&quot; (Ralph Montagu) When they failed to secure a conviction in the first trial, there's no doubt they would have felt humiliated. This is a huge thing to have done, to bring a prosecution in open court against the peer of the realm and then for the charges to collapse. That really doesn't look good for the police or for the Director of Public Prosecutions. And so when evidence came up and they could take the man back to court, they leapt on it with great relish. (Oliver Tobias) &quot;The evidence that led to my second arrest, &quot;derived from a seemingly insignificant chain of events, dating back more than a year prior to the first trial.&quot; (Matthew Parris) There was an affair going on between a young journalist called Peter Wildeblood, and an aircraftman, a member of the Royal Air Force, called McNally. (Dr. Matt Houlbrook) Peter Wildeblood is a journalist who was just about to make the move up to be the Daily Mail's diplomatic correspondent and he was good friends with Lord Montagu. (Oliver Tobias) &quot;On the 21st of August, 1952, &quot;I hosted a small party at my beach hut. &quot;Peter Wildeblood and Edward McNally were invited, &quot;along with another RAF man, John Reynolds and my cousin, Michael Pitt Rivers.&quot; (Ralph Montagu) Yes, they had a fun dinner together and he says yes, they put some music on and there was a little bit of dancing, so as far as he was concerned, it was all a very innocent affair. What seems to happen is that at some point over the winter of 1953-1954, the RAF authorities are going through McNally's personal possessions and find there, a number of letters, letters written from him to Wildeblood. (Matthew Parris) They were in love with each other and in one of these letters it was mentioned that the two of them had been down to Montagu's place and it was there, with that revelation, that the whole thing started. ♪ The charge against Lord Montagu was inciting certain male persons to have sexual relations with certain other male persons. (Dr. Matt Houlbrook) Basically, his role in the case is defined as bringing together or creating opportunity for Wildeblood and Pitt Rivers to have sex with McNally and Reynolds. You'd probably find it very, very hard to understand what went on, why did it happen? &quot;My arrest for homosexual offenses could not have come &quot;at a worse time. &quot;Britain was in the midst of the Cold War, &quot;and two MI5 agents, Guy Burgess and Donald Maclean &quot;had recently defected to Moscow. &quot;Both men were discovered to be spies and they were gay. &quot;This led to the notion that homosexuality was associated &quot;with Communism and should be viewed as a security risk. &quot;Egged on by the national press, the police were &quot;on a mission to liberate British society of these men, especially those in positions of power.&quot; Unfortunately, for Lord Montagu, at this particular moment, with the climate out there of scandal mongering, this came at that unfortunate time and acted as a catalyst. Effectively, McNally and Reynolds were blackmailed by the police. If you give evidence against the defendants, you won't be prosecuted. They were nobodies. No one had heard of them and the really big prize the police were hunting were the peer of the realm and the journalist. (Fred Norris) And we all felt that he was a scapegoat. Because of who he was, the police were really after him. And we felt so sorry for him. &quot;For the first time, I realized that there were dangerous snakes in the grass.&quot; (Matthew Parris) The press, of course, fell with great glee on this trial. We all understand that the media can whip things up in a nasty way. And that's what they did. (Matthew Parris) They used the handle that they knew their readers would find most exciting and that was the fact that a peer of the realm, Lord Montagu, was involved. He's a young, glamorous, attractive, fashionable man about town. He's a high profile figure in society columns and social networks of Mayfair and the countryside. Because he has that sort of profile, it's a great story. It's the sort of story of a great man's potential decline or fall. (Jeffrey Weeks) The trial took place in the great Hall of Winchester. There were 19 charges in all, brought against the defendants, Montagu, Pitt Rivers, and Peter Wildeblood and they involved a variety of sexual activities, gross indecency, anal intercourse. (Oliver Tobias) &quot;The first few days were the worst &quot;because they consisted of the prosecution presenting &quot;their case and the charges themselves, &quot;the constant repetition of conspiracy, gross indecency and buggery, making them sound revolting.&quot; What became absolutely evident in the second trial was the class prejudices of all concerned. If aristocrats, very rich people wanted to do naughty things in private, fine, but when classes were being mixed, working class or airmen, members of the armed forces were doing things with aristocrats, people didn't like that. &quot;I was regarded by the older generation of the establishment &quot;as a traitor to my class and although this notion &quot;looks ludicrous now, in those days the class system was rigid to an extent, unbelievable today.&quot; Strangely enough, throughout the trial, my father was actually engaged to a lady called Ann Gage, but sadly, that didn't survive and she broke it off. (Oliver Tobias) &quot;At half-past four on the 24th of March, 1954, a jury delivered their verdicts.&quot; (Dr. Matt Houlbrook) It was quite simple. Montagu himself is convicted on the charge of conspiracy and sentenced to 12 months' imprisonment. Wildeblood and Pitt-Rivers are sentenced to 18 months' imprisonment. (Oliver Tobias) &quot;After the jury announced its verdict, my counsel, &quot;Bill Fearnley Whittingstall addressed the judge. &quot;His words were measured and somber &quot;and I shall always remember them. &quot;Whatever the future may hold, in the past, &quot;he was a useful member of the House of Lords &quot;and a kindly landowner. He is faced with a bitter future.&quot; The whole thing just seemed so unfair and so unreasonable. It's very difficult to know how to put it into any kind of proper perspective and clearly even at the time, there were those saying, &quot;This is wrong, this shouldn't be happening.&quot; (Matt Cook) Montagu was really quite young at the time of the trial. He was just 27. If you look in broader perspective at what a prosecution for homosexual offenses could mean at this time, this was really potentially devastating. (narrator) Many people committed suicide. Many people had their lives completely destroyed. Historians have traditionally seen the trial as a moment of which public opinion does shift. So later in 1954, the Home Secretary Sir David Maxwell Fyfe sets up a departmental committee on homosexual offenses and prostitution, also known as the Wolfenden Committee. And basically recommended that homosexual activity between men in private should be decriminalized. There is no doubt that this trial was the catalyst, almost the trigger for the changes to the law that were to take place. [cell door rattles and slams shut] (Oliver Tobias) &quot;At an otherwise low moment, this was a sort of solace. &quot;I did not have to deal with the constant press, &quot;worry about earning a living, &quot;nor dwell upon my confused sexuality. &quot;I was still very much in love with Ann and kept her photo &quot;in my cell. &quot;Overall, I used my time in prison to reflect and plan for the future.&quot; It was a sorry affair, but it didn't lock him down. ♪ (Elizabeth speaking on tape) (Elizabeth speaking on tape) Our generation just can't conceive what happened anyway. It's just-it's staggeringly ridiculous anyway, but even to us, you just think, well it's just madness. That can't have happened, but it did not that long ago and it happened to a friend of mine and it shouldn't have happened to a friend of mine. My father told me that when he was younger, people used to use the word, Montagu, as a polite way of suggesting that somebody was gay. We have a number of different euphemisms and one of them used to be, &quot;Is he a bit of a Montagu?&quot; You know, that kind of thing never goes away. People always kind of remember. I think as a human being, he had this incredible strength to rise above it. He didn't go and hide in a corner. (Matthew Parris) It would take a lot to sink him, I think. There's a resilience. (James Harvey-Bathurst) Edward's nephew told me that he came out of prison on a Friday. On Sunday, Edward's mother said, &quot;Alright, we're going to church.&quot; She took him on her arm up the aisle into the family pew so everybody could see it was over. Because it's certainly, in my experience, wasn't the first gay aristocrat, by any means... nor the last. (Oliver Tobias) &quot;The Montagu case was certainly a watershed moment in my life, but I was determined for it not to define me.&quot; &quot;My priority was to return to my beloved Beaulieu &quot;and make it clear to everyone that I was returning &quot;unashamed to the helm. &quot;This, after all, was my heritage and I was responsible for its future.&quot; &quot;Over the past two years, during the trial and my imprisonment, &quot;Beaulieu had remained open to the public. &quot;However, my public image had been shattered &quot;and our visitors in numbers were decreasing. &quot;By this time, there were hundreds of other stately homes open to the public, all in need of generating income.&quot; Later on, it became absolutely obvious that as there was more competition in the stately home business and the visitor attraction business, Beaulieu had to change. It couldn't just stay exactly as it was. By historic house standards, this is a tiny historic house. England is famous for its massive historic houses. This is really quite small. (Oliver Tobias) &quot;The first point I accepted was that Palace House was not &quot;an architectural masterpiece, &quot;like Castle Howard &quot;or Chatsworth. &quot;And although I had one of the oldest houses, &quot;it did not have the major historical appeal, &quot;like Blenheim where Winston Churchill was born. &quot;These major stately homes virtually sell themselves, &quot;and I was well aware we were not in that class. &quot;I needed some attraction to make the visit to Beaulieu special and unique.&quot; The eldest son, historically, has been the inheritor of not just the land, but the house, the paintings, the jewelry and in some cases, the collection of cars. &quot;This was a notion that came to me almost fully fledged, &quot;as I lay awake in bed one night. &quot;Like most of the best ideas, it was very simple. &quot;So much so, that in retrospect, it seems extraordinary that no one else had already thought of it.&quot; (Voiceover) Here is a Daimler, similar to the one in which King Edward took his first ride. And here, a 1904 Vauxhall. Outside, we find a De Dion Bouton being started up by the present Lord Montagu. [engine starts] He wants to do something to commemorate his father's life and that really was what that first display of old cars in the front was all about. The Lord Montagu's father was one of the leading lights when the motorcar was almost at its birth. Anybody who had any interest in reading the motorsports magazines or the motoring magazines, would have been able to tell many tales of the Montagu heritage in line with the motorcar. (Oliver Tobias) &quot;My father was one of Britain's great motoring pioneers at a time when the motorcar was not accepted.&quot; The early motorcars were an extraordinary combination of noisy, rattly, dirty things which of course, ran on roads which were not tarmaced so the dust was enormous. (Murray Walker) People didn't like them. They regarded them as socially divisive. Cars were just not socially acceptable. And there was a time, actually, in this country, where if you were in a motorcar, you had to have a man with a red flag walking in front of you to warn people that a motorcar was coming. Most people didn't like the horseless carriage, purely because it was a sign of A, you're rich, B, they were noisy, smelly things, you know and people I think didn't trust them. (Sir Jackie Stewart) Suddenly, the horseless carriage arrived, doing the ridiculous speeds of 10, 15, even 20 miles an hour. (Michael Ware) They really weren't at all popular and one of the first things the motorcar people had to do was really a public relations movement to get themselves accepted. (Ben Cussons) John Scott Montagu very much was the motoring spokesman in Parliament, obviously as a peer, he sat in the House of Lords and he was the first man to drive a car to the houses of Parliament. Well, he was a really enthusiastic early motorist and the main thing he did was he also introduced the car to the royal family. Lord Montagu's father invited my great grandfather, King Edward VII down to Beaulieu, in order to have a look at this strange thing called the motorcar. And he gave the whole automobile movement a good kick start. Once you get the Royal Family on board, socially, that made an enormous difference. So, Montagu's father introduced royalty to motoring in this country and motoring changed the world, changed this country and this guy started it all off. (Oliver Tobias) &quot;I was intensely proud of my father's achievements &quot;and always felt a sense of deprivation for not knowing him. &quot;So this small display of his memorabilia seemed like &quot;a fitting tribute. I had no conception how much it would change things.&quot; (Mary Montagu) He just put the cars in the front hall of the house because they were interesting old cars and very soon he realized that the public were really, really interested in these old cars and he thought, &quot;Wow, what a good idea. I'm going to collect more old cars.&quot; You really only saw old cars in the sort of big London museums like the science museum and places like that. The London science museum, for instance, had several motorcars, but it also had several airplanes and several ships and several everything, but there was no dedicated motor museum at all. (Oliver Tobias) &quot;When I first conceived the idea, the main drawback &quot;was that I had only one veteran car. This was my father's 1903, six horsepower De Dion Bouton.&quot; And Edward came to my father and asked him for help because my father had a lot of contacts in the motor world and he and my mother came to live in Palace House and my father helped Edward develop what was then, basically a large wooden hut. (Oliver Tobias) &quot;As we searched for cars to fill our humble museum, &quot;I saw that many of the old cars my father once treasured &quot;were being sold for pences on the pound, or finding their home in scap yards.&quot; We turn to look at now, to a 30s Rolls Royce and it looks to be something that's stunningly beautiful. Forty years ago, they were ugly. They were just old, ugly cars. I mean, you could go and buy a C-Type Jaguar for 200 or 300 pounds and now you're talking four or five million. He recognized the value in the heritage in these cars at a time when many of them were being chopped up and cannibalized and he realized that we were dealing with the same way a great piece of architecture, that if you knocked the building down, you destroyed history. (Sir Jackie Stewart) He had a garage, if you like, of magnificent cars, that normally people would not get up close and personal with. (Graham Robison) He, more than anyone else, inspired people to look upon older motorcars as being worthwhile, worth looking at, learning from, when other people treated them as junk. In 1958, one of the very first cars that Lord Montagu actually went out and collected to restore, was this 1909 Rolls Royce. This car was virtually derelict. It was a breakdown truck and it was then a flatbed truck and was found with no body work, just a box for a seat and in a really, really rundown state. And he did so much research into this car to find its original body, the original styling, the wheels, even down to the German silver for the radiator. This Rolls Royce is very important to Lord Montagu because it's a tactile link with the memory of his father. In fact, the mascot that you see mounted on the radiator of every Rolls Royce produced today, known as the Spirit of Ecstasy, was commissioned by Lord Montagu's father. (TV Interviewer) Of course, you've got close family connections with Rolls Royce. Your father was partly responsible for the lady mascot, wasn't he? (Lord Montagu) That is correct. My father commissioned his official artist on his magazine, Car Illustrated , a man called Charles Sykes to design a mascot and the mascot's model was my father's secretary who was a very beautiful Edwardian woman, called Miss Eleanor Thornton. (Doug Hill) They were lovers and she was actually on board the SS Persia when it was torpedoed at the start of the Great War and she was killed in that torpedo attack and John Scott Montagu survived. And Eleanor Thornton was immortalized in the Spirit of Ecstasy. (Ralph Montagu) Another thing that makes the Silver Ghost special is that it is the same model that my grandfather had and I'm sure he likes to feel that he's experiencing all the same emotions as he drives that car as his father did. (Oliver Tobias) &quot;To some, an old car may just be an old car, but for me, they are part of our memories.&quot; (Graham Robison) The sort of people who were coming to Palace House, they were in their 50s and 60s usually. They were of the sort who were looking at a motorcar and say, &quot;My goodness, my father used to have one of these.&quot; And you can look at your wife or your son and say, &quot;If you turn this knob here,&quot; and &quot;You push that button here,&quot; that happens. Fascinating to have a museum, a collection of cars, all doing different things to arrive at the same result. (Oliver Tobias) &quot;The motorcar is one of man's greatest inventions and the story of its evolution fascinates me.&quot; (Nick Mason) Really, he was ahead of the enormous enthusiasm for cars that was developing. (Oliver Tobias) &quot;Unlike during my father's time, the motorcar was now &quot;reasonably affordable and socially, it was becoming very popular.&quot; It wasn't something which only the nobs had. It was something that everybody could associate, from somebody who had a Rolls Royce to somebody who has just got a little old tin pot Austin 7 and that was a stroke of genius. This is Beaulieu and here comes one of the veteran cars that everybody comes to see, for this is the home of the famous Montagu Motor Museum. I don't know whether it was a conscious plan, but it was almost as if he smothered people's recollection of the bad publicity with new publicity about him, which was good. (male announcer) Lord Montagu at the wheel of a 64 year old De Dion Bouton and having trouble, but it's all in the cause of safety. He was demonstrating a new motorway safety device which could save many lives. It's the horn blower system. (Gerry Wadman) He needed to be approachable. He needed to get to know people and he was genuinely interested in people, he was genuinely interested in motoring of all sorts. (Sir Jackie Stewart) Eventually he said, &quot;Well the cars look so good, why don't we show them off?&quot; (male announcer) Don't run away with the idea that these old masters are just showpieces. At rallies like this, they have to prove their worth with exacting efficiency. In this time section, points watched are braking, reversing, maneuverability and parking. (Gerry Wadman) Lord Montagu decided that the way to get people to come, was to come and see other people enjoying their cars. ♪ Motoring, certainly for a lot of the British people, is a passion and he exudes that passion in bucket loads. He was infected by the motorcar and all that went with it. I think him great because of his enthusiasm. Very enthusiastic and certainly fired me up. (Oliver Tobias) &quot;For the next several years, Beaulieu was host &quot;to all sorts of motoring race, from cars, to motorcycles &quot;and even bicycles. People came from all across the country to participate.&quot; You can't say &quot;Beaulieu&quot; without thinking of motorcars and the Montagus. (Murray Walker) The Montagu Motor Museum became tremendously popular because of Edward Montagu's drive. (Oliver Tobias) &quot;The museum reached new heights, when in 1957, &quot;we acquired the Golden Arrow, the first car ever to reach 231 miles per hour.&quot; That's the sort of thing that made this collection unique. Within three years, in 1959, the popularity and success of this first Montagu Motor Museum was so great, that it was becoming the main attraction at Beaulieu. We were getting 100,000 people here and that's a hell of a lot of people to cram into sheds. The demand, actually, the supply, and almost immediately the public was saying, &quot;We want more.&quot; (TV program male announcer) And on this fine April day in 1959, hosts of strange vehicles are converging upon the peace and quiet of Beaulieu, to celebrate the opening of a new extension to the museum, housing over 200 historic exhibits. Feast your eyes on one of the largest gatherings of veteran and vintage cars and motorcycles the world has ever seen. Over an enclosure, Lord Montagu welcomes his guests. The big moment is nearly on us. They read about it in the papers and now they may even see themselves on TV. Lord Montagu now comes to the microphone with his fiancé, Miss Belinda Crossley, by his side, their wedding less than a week away. For him, today is a great occasion, the culmination of years of unremitting work. (Lord Montagu) Lord Robinson, ladies and gentlemen, since 1952, it has been my aim to try to set up in this country a national museum of transport. Today, this dream has been realized. (Oliver Tobias) &quot;Thus, after seven years, the Montagu Motor Museum &quot;was properly established and Beaulieu had become &quot;a major tourist attraction. &quot;Our busiest day was followed by our busiest year. &quot;From then on, annually, we had over half a million visitors &quot;and for guests arriving by helicopter, we painted &quot;Montagu Motor Museum on the roof. ♪ &quot;In 1958, I rediscovered Belinda Crossley &quot;and I was very happy, as were all the family, when she accepted me.&quot; Well, he was a neighbor, really, who I didn't know very well and who I got to know more and more. When we were married, part of our honeymoon, we took a traveling exhibition, four cars, motorcycles. I am not crazy about cars. There are other things that I am more interested in, but I enjoyed going on rallies and the people and the interest of seeing other places and driving, I enjoyed. (male announcer) Lady Montagu in her 1909 Humber, a wedding present from her husband draws up to Palace House. I was very much conscious that one had to produce an heir and it was very lucky that Ralph was born, a son. (Oliver Tobias) &quot;In 1961, Belinda and I welcomed our first child &quot;into the world and I was very excited it was a boy. &quot;We named him Ralph, after the great 18th Century Duke of Montagu.&quot; Oh, he was delighted, absolutely delighted. And fired a cannon off in front of the house. [cannon shot] Well, Mary was born three years later. (Mary Montagu) We were brought up in a very old fashioned way, even for the time in the 1960s, to be brought up very separate, in a wing of the house with a nanny who was here day in day out, never took a day off. By the time I was born, it was already a very established business and huge numbers of visitors came into the house and it was very obtrusive. (Belinda, Lady Montagu) Living in a house which is open to the public is quite difficult because you really, your privacy is, you have to guard very much. (Oliver Tobias) &quot;Sacrificing one's privacy was the price I was prepared to pay &quot;to keep my home. However, it was perhaps my wife and children who had the most to put up with. (Ralph Montagu) [as a child] Well, I remember when I was a little boy, I used to shout, &quot;Go away, you horrible people&quot; and that's how I stopped that question. As a little boy, I obviously didn't like the sight of all these people. I didn't realize they were bringing money, you know. I just thought they were invading us and I would stand up at the window and bang on the glass and say, &quot;Go away, you horrible people. I don't do that anymore. (Belinda, Lady Montagu) And it wasn't just the paying customers. It was the staff too because we had offices in the house and so there were always people around. You come out of your bedroom and there's half of the public walking down in front of you and I can remember seeing Lady Montagu, sticking her head around her bedroom to see if there was anybody in the corridor. We are now in the public part of the house, which the tourists visit, but the really intriguing part of the house is behind this door here marked 'private' and this is where the Montagu family actually live. (Lord Montagu) My family and I live in a flat in Palace House and we do try to lead as normal a family life as possible. But when you live on top of a shop, your home life must inevitably suffer. Edward, one day, when there was a visitor visiting his house, this chap set up his picnic on Edward's private lawn. Edward wasn't very amused by it, so he went outside and said, &quot;Excuse me, this is the private section of the house.&quot; Chap said, &quot;Well you're open and it's public so I am having my picnic here.&quot; So, Edward said, &quot;Okay then, fine. Would you mind signing the visitor's book while you are here and put a name, address&quot; and chap duly did it. Next weekend, Edward plus chauffer, I think in a Rolls Royce, turned up at this chap's garden, set up his picnic, to the fury of the guy in the house. Quite an amusing story, but it sort of tells what we had to put up with and at the same time, you know, what the public are expecting us to do in return. (Lord Montagu) It was somewhat traumatic at first, but now, I suppose I'm used to the lack of privacy, to the smell of humanity in the house. If they were suddenly to disappear, I think I would miss them. (Ralph Montagu) [as child] Alright, now here... We have the only entrance to my house and inside we've just been having tea. On that end, we have a table and a chair and sometimes the steam engine. Here, we have our television aerials as is. (Lord Montagu) Tours around his house are free now, but one day, Ralph would inherit the whole estate and already I know he feels a special responsibility towards Beaulieu, as I did at his age. (Ralph Montagu) [child] This is what I own now and that is all of, round the river and Beaulieu. (Ralph Montagu) Growing up in Palace House was not a sort of normal family experience and yet for us, of course, it was all we knew. We had, my father often entertaining guests, quite often celebrities, almost like members of an extended family. We got to know anyone who worked here, whether it was the cashier or the guides in the house or the managers or the secretaries, the receptionist, they were all around us. (male announcer) Six pence on the train for the kids. Dodge 'em cars, model trains, go-carts. The full fun fair spread is theirs while car lovers spend their five bobs in the museum. (Lord Montagu) I think this is probably one of the secrets of the success of Beaulieu, is that we are an outing for the whole family. One of Lord Montagu's great attributes was thinking up new events to be held at Beaulieu. ♪ It was a very jolly place. There were sort of fair ground rides that Lord Montagu had introduced. There was a hovercraft here, one of the very first hovercrafts. There was a train parked in a field. It was a bizarre mixture of things in this very traditional English countryside setting. All sorts of extraordinary things went on here and some were very successful and some, not so. It's like a guy banging a drum outside a theater, saying, &quot;Come on in, we got a great show here.&quot; He was fun and as he started doing his commercial activities, others followed suit. ♪ A number of stately homeowners realized that they needed some other gimmick or attraction. Now, at Longleat, for example, it was lions. [lions roaring] (Marques of Bath) But instead of humans going around and looking at lions in their cages, humans kept in the cage of the car and drove in amongst the lions, was the general idea. (Ralph Montagu) All sorts of different ideas were tried and tested whereas at Beaulieu we were very happy to stick with cars, thank you. They don't need feeding as often. (male announcer) Welcome to the world of wheels. (narrator) They called Beaulieu the Disneyland of stately homes. Lord Montagu doesn't mind. He'd give up anything before giving up Beaulieu. He brought ideas to the market and he was setting the standard and some followed at quite another stage, but also, that generation of aristocracy, they would be the older generation, which should have been quite old fashioned and they would have looked down on what Ed was doing. Well, he would have been thought of, within that period, as really being the height of vulgarity. I have actually used the word, vulgarity. I mean, not being that kind of old fashioned Englishman and turning the place over in that kind of crude, commercial razzmatazz way, been regarded as letting society down and we don't really want to invite him to dinner, do we? He was daunted, naturally and a bit lonely. It was difficult for him because it was his peer group, thought this is terrible that he was being very commercial. (Fiona Montagu) I mean he was much maligned by the aristocracy. Oh! I mean, his name was mud, that dreadful, commercial Lord Montagu. (Sir Roy Strong) And for a lot of his life, he didn't really care a damn what anybody thought. He got on with it and did it and what must be very satisfying to him, is that... uh... he proved to be right. ♪ ♪ The stately homes of England, we proudly represent. ♪ ♪ We only them up for Americans to rent, ♪ ♪ Though the pipes that supply the bathroom burst, ♪ ♪ And the lavatory makes you fear the worst, ♪ ♪ It was used by Charles I ♪ I mean, he exuded energy and he knew where he wanted to take things. His leadership in the early days was... it was incredibly important. All stately homeowners must remember now that there is no place in this world for a gifted amateur. And I think if it hadn't been for him, then it may have died a death. He was always brought up with a very deep sense of history, which carried him through and made him a national figure. And he made it fun, too. That's quite important. ♪ But still if they ever catch on fire, ♪ ♪ which with any luck, they might. ♪ ♪ We'll fight for the stately homes of England. ♪ ♪ When you charge people money to see your home, you have to make sure it's worth looking at.

We did. (announcer) Treat your home like a stately home. Excuse me, Sir, are you really Lord Montagu's butler? Oh, no, he would only be the star. He would never be an extra. ♪ ♪ Lord Montagu of course has a very wide variety of friends, particularly in show business. ♪ (Mary Montagu) He always wanted to go backstage and see the stars. This is a big feature of my father. He loves the celebrity. (Ralph Montagu) Well, my father loves celebrity and as a child, I met some of these people. I can remember Diana Dors, Roy Orbison. Cher did a TV special here. None of the Beatles sadly ever made it, but Mick Jagger came and then later Liberace came one day with his friend, Michael Jackson. So, we've seen all sorts here over the years. ♪ (Andrew Lancel) Describe the scenery of a Edward Montagu party. It's sort of Chekhov, Shakespeare, Hockney, Dali on acid. ♪ Hundreds of people all in themed costume and in all cases, of course, Lord Montagu right at the center and also the life and soul of the party. Great party man, loved dressing up. Absolutely bizarre extraordinary man. All the activity he ever did were always very short and quick. He would go boat and he'd go for like an hour, have lunch, come back again, do something else. If he wanted to read a book, he'd speed read the book, put it down and then do something else. He had such an amazing amount of energy. He was doing so many different things. Edward Montagu is a multi-faceted character. I came across him in Australia, in Perth when we were on tour and suddenly there was Edward and Prince Michael and they were doing some car rally across the Australian desert. He'll pop up anywhere in the world. He was a kind of walking ad man or a driving one. Lord Montagu is one successful, aristocratic entrepreneur. [applause] Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. I'd like to welcome you to this esteemed festival. Later on we have the entire cast of the musical 'Hair', coming from... As the business grew, you could say there were mixed blessings. Yes, there was more money coming in, the business was able to grow, but he did somewhat lose sight of his own family's concerns. (announcer) We have a special announcement. Lord Montagu is here in the museum this afternoon to autograph catalogs and guidebooks. My father loves to be in the spotlight and for his children; that is not necessarily the case. I mean, Ralph, you know, didn't like being in the media spotlight so much and found it hard and I think for all of us growing up here, that was certainly something that was a conflict. (Ralph Montagu) It was very busy when my father was here, but he would also travel a lot to promote Beaulieu and so, there would be a long time when we didn't see him. He was so focused on Beaulieu and on his life, you know, we didn't see him much. We didn't do much with him. When your home is your business, as it is here with us, one has all sorts of complications. You never can really escape from your business life. It can't... it's with you all the time. I always feel that my mother left my father, primarily because she had become disillusioned with Beaulieu and I think that was particularly because she was no longer as influential as she had been in helping develop the business. And, I think she felt sidelined and no longer able to play the role that she had been, which was sad. She was rather, sort of left in the... out in the cold a bit. (Oliver Tobias) &quot;In retrospect, I now see my intense desire to keep my home &quot;and heritage that caused me to lose sight of my own family.&quot; My father was very sad, but he didn't, uh, linger too long. Once he realized it was inevitable, um, he couldn't bear the thought of Beaulieu not having a lady of the manor. (male announcer) Lord Montagu has wanted a quiet family wedding, a top drawer do with the wraps on, but when you're a baron of the English aristocracy with 12,000 acres to your name, plus Britain's top stately home and motor museum, then perhaps you must expect a photographic scrum down on your wedding day. So, Beaulieu was becoming more and more commercial and I think Edward looked at me and thought, yeah, she... she would be good. And so then he told his brother he was going to marry me, didn't tell me and his brother told me and I said, 'Oh no, oh no.&quot; And then, Robin said, my brother always gets what he wants. He's so charming. And so I said to him, &quot;Well I think you're very nice, but you must be hell to be married to.&quot; And he went, &quot;Oh, why?&quot; with his big eyes and his charm. And thereupon I remember my husband flew to New York to talk to my friend in New York and lined up all my friends from Rhodesia and he got them all on his side. I mean he's... he's an operator and our son is a bit the same. It definitely wasn't much like any of my other friends' childhood I think, you know, I actually found it wonderful living here, but it certainly took a sort of amount of adaptation to be surrounded by people the entire time. Apart from here, apart from the estate, where, like the beach hut, for example, where you really can go and relax, I always felt, you know, some what sort of on show the entire time. My father can be challenging to work with because he's extremely impatient and very energetic and I think like quite a lot of successful people, has amazing, uh, sort of attention deficit disorder. Thankfully, I am somebody who has a lot of energy too, so I can kind of keep up with him, but I know that there were times where there was just way too much going on. I think when I married him, I thought, &quot;Well I won't be bored.&quot; And now, I quite often long for a dull day. The way we live here, we're open seven days a week. Um... we live above the shop. It's absolutely psychologically relentless. I remember one particular morning, I went to the window in our bedroom and I looked out and I was just quietly gazing across these lawns and Edward rolled in and said, &quot;What are you doing?&quot; And I said, &quot;I'm doing nothing, I'm being.&quot; And he said, &quot;But I had two or three meetings, I've been on two television shows, I've launched a boat.&quot; And I said to him, &quot;Well, why not try and be a little and not do so much?&quot; ♪ (Oliver Tobias) &quot;Sometimes, I wonder if I've gone mad, subjecting myself and my family to these crowds, I seem so eager to attract.&quot; &quot;But for Beaulieu, it is good business.&quot; Edward's only bride ever was Beaulieu. He just loves this earth, so if he ever had to sell this place, it would have been terrible. So, he had to build it up. He was brought up with that from the age of three, to believe that that was his whole life, so I suppose he's always known that was his destiny. I find it difficult to imagine growing up in a big house like this and on an estate without forming a deep attachment to it and I certainly have. If you have anything as precious, as beautiful as this piece of countryside, you do feel responsibility that you have to treat it with great love and respect. (Mary Montagu) You know, that's why we're here is to keep the historic fabric together, to keep it all going. This is about a family that is a part of this place. They always have been. They always will be. They are dedicated to it and they grow up, having to take what it is and having to make of it what they can in the future and Lord Montagu, of course, has done that in a particular way. (Oliver Tobias) &quot;I firmly believe that places like this, &quot;originally built for the pleasure of the few, should now be enjoyed by the many.&quot; (narrator) In 1971, the Montagu Museum is moving into new, bigger and better premises. And of course, the center of the whole thing, is a new museum building of great splendor. This is going to cost a lot of money. That was quite difficult to achieve because we were talking about a large sum of money, which he had to borrow. (Murray Walker) I sat round the table with Lord Montagu, all his advisors and directors. I said, &quot;We don't think we should do the museum.&quot; Lord Montagu says, &quot;I'm going to do it.&quot; He is like a dog with a bone, and so the people around him just have to say, &quot;Well alright, if that's what you want, we'll do that.&quot; (Ken Robinson) You have to remember that he was making this business work from a starting point where there wasn't enough money to pay for the running of the estate, so it was always, always going to the next bit of possibility. (announcer) The occasion was the official opening of the National Motor Museum. (Sir Jackie Stewart) It was another opportunity for tourism in the United Kingdom to boast of something that was unique to our country. And people came from far and wide. (Duke of Kent) And I would like to congratulate Lord Montagu himself, who has had the energy and the enthusiasm to see this enterprise through to its completion. You have to realize that in 1972 when the National Motor Museum was opened, Edward Montagu had lived down, frankly, being unacceptable in British society. And it says a lot for him that he has been able to weather that storm in his life, which would have flattened most people. [applause] Today, I am indeed a happy man, to see a dream realized. So now, after 20 years, it is no longer my museum; it is yours. [applause] ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ He collected some really great racing vehicles and very historically it was, but he also has an eye.

Take it, there are larger car museums with literally hundreds of Bugatti's lined up, but they never did tell a story. ♪ ♪ I most respect Lord Montagu for having carried on the legacy of his father, to have been as proud of his father as he is and to have laid down something that Britain will be proud of long after he's gone. When you look back at what sort of a man he is and what he has achieved, it is a tribute to what one man can do with his life. History is riven with people who have fallen and then never rise again and I think it's an extraordinary tribute to Edward that he managed to, like a Phoenix, rise from the ashes. ♪ I think one of the important lessons I've learned from my father, is that you can delegate many things in this type of business, but one thing you can't delegate is, sort of being yourself. ♪ ♪ Edward, if you're listening to this, I'd just like to say what fun it was, all the things we did and thank you for having me as a trustee.
