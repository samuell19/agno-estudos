-I hope no one touched the statue. -No, sir! What happened? Sir, they created a fake as good as the original and stole the original statue. Okay, file an FIR stating the statute is safe, and only a murder ensued. And record it as a murder investigation. Sir, the original statue is missing. It's wrong! I have filed fifteen FIRs similar to this. What else do you expect? If we report it missing, the people will protest to find the statue. It'll become a law and order problem. You won't understand the politics. Do as I say. Okay, sir. Let's go! Varma, please open your eyes and see me. We haven't done anything wrong. I swear I will never betray you. Varma, please hear me out. One of us is a traitor. Why would you punish all three? Brother, please investigate and find out the truth and then make a decision. I'm not a CB-CID to investigate and find out the truth. It's best to kill everyone under suspicion. Please show us some mercy. You've worked with me for ten years and you know how I operate... yet you expect mercy from me. Are you insulting me? Hey, Dhanraj! Show them mercy. Bloody, I don't get a network in this dungeon. How does he expect me to show them mercy? Here you go. -Hey! -Hey, Dhanraj! -Spare my family, Varma. -Oh, God, no! Why are you crying? Is that your family? Show him his family. You punish me all you want. But spare my family. This is my way of showing you mercy. [In Malayalam] What would your family do without you? Likewise, what would you do without your family? Varma, if you keep up this charade... In the end, no one will be left to save you. Varma is enough to save himself. -Varma, please spare me. -Who the hell are you? Please, Varma, please don't do it. Hey, Varma! Hey! Hey, Muruga! Hey, wake up! Did you die? Hurry up, get me water, damn it! Come on, hurry up! Wake up, damn it! Hey! He's dead, Varma! You're not like before you've become soft. You killed him with one blow. I was dreaming about torturing and killing him. Look at me. Varma, Dhanraj claims to be loyal. What if he betrayed you? Is he accusing me? Come on, hit me! Kill me exactly like you killed him. Hey, he's rambling, and you're taking him seriously. Why is he accusing me? He should not! So, give me the hammer. How dare you challenge me hanging upside down? Here I come! Show me your head, dear. What did you say about me and Varma? Instead of guarding the statue, you're squealing. Die! Die! Die! What do you know about Varma? He's my friend for life. Say now! Talk. Why aren't you talking now? I can't find your mouth. The squealing mouth is missing. Varma, brother... brother... brother... -Varma! -Everyone, listen closely. I don't know if Varma would die for himself. But I will die for him. Watch me! Watch me! Poonai, take care of Varma. Hey, Varma! Listen carefully. The accounts are on the laptop. Laptop password: Varma is my friend. Varma, don't trust anyone. All of them are robbers! They will cheat you! I'm going to die, and you guys aren't making way for me. Fools, step aside! -Hey, lift him. -Going to hell! Wow! -Hey, drop them dead! -Brother, please don't do it. Brother, please spare me. Ravi, please don't close it. -Okay. -What's all this? Hang up. I'll call you back. Varma, the container has been seized. Call Seenu. He went in at 07:00 a.m. Now it's 10:00 a.m. How long will he ring the bell? And how will I complete my shoot? By the day, his attitude is getting worse. Does he even realize how tough is it to run a YouTube channel? Rithvik, I told you I'd help with the shoot. I don't need your help. You carry on drying laundry. Why is she not enough for you? Guess, who is this? Who is it? -It's me. -Oh... He's so good that I can't identify myself. If he does not step out, I'll start crying. Followed by six hours of non-stop crying. -Everyone will get a headache. -Hey, don't do it. -Hold on. -You don't fear me anymore. -You don't respect me. -Don't you dare start crying. Then it'll be a task to make you stop crying. He does not seem to cease from prayers. Listen... I've told you often not to knock on the door while praying. You promised him to shoot a video. As you did not come out, he's creating a scene. Go and see for yourself. You people are taking turns to yell at me. One day I'll prove my worth. I wonder where he is. I don't know what he's going to say. Oh, you're here. Come on. It's getting late. As it is, you're late. But you pretend well to be enthusiastic. On top of it, sass to butter me up. Sorry, sir, I was running late. Take out the camera. What are we shooting today? -Gardening! -Gardening? It's scorching hot today. Let's shoot a bathroom tour. It's the latest trend. Bathroom tour? Yeah! Look how beautifully they're cleaning up. Scroll down to the comment section. Look at the disgusting comments. Action sir! Friends, look at the outcome from two months of nurturing it. Cut, cut, cut. Sir, it looks like you bought it from the store. It does not look real. This content is enough for 96 subscribers. Don't we need to be loyal to our subscribers? The work should be real. How? Looks great. Now it looks real. Do you call this real? Thank goodness we did not do the bathroom tour. Had we done it, you would've stripped me naked. Sorry. Okay. Take. Excuse me! He's calling you. Why don't you find out what he wants? Instead, you both have been whistling and playing with each other. Okay, sir. Oh, God, did you cut yourself while placing the knife? You could've been careful. Don't bother about it. Look at this. Get inside the car. What is it, Muthu? He's a friend. We're just chatting. Friend? But he looks like a rogue. Ritu, you should respect elders. Apologize to him. Sorry! To hell with your sorry. Are you coming, or shall I take your grandson? -I will come. -Let's go! Get me a cup of coffee. I'll go and get coffee. Would you massage his head? Come to the front. I ought to! It's the Police. Speak with respect. Go and get us coffee. -He wants me to do everything. -Sir, I'll pay your price. But please give me back the statue you seized yesterday. It gets shipped from Tamilnadu to Trivandrum, Mumbai, Singapore, and Los Angeles. I did not follow this case for five years and discovered it just to hand it over as soon as you asked. But to arrest your entire network. You can see how deep this network runs. Why do you want to get into this mess? I'll spare you if you confess the truth. I'll whack you before your men and drag you in your undies if you don't. He's threatening. Mani, let's say something that'll scare the AC. Bring me the statue, and you can take away your father. Father? Why did you kidnap him? I've seen people holding the tiger's tail over the fear of a cat. But you directly held the dinosaur's tail! Have you seen a dinosaur with a hacked limb? Wait a minute. I'll ask them to bring his hacked hand. Muruga, hack that dinosaur's hand and send me a picture. Muruga passed out. It'll take an hour for him to wake up. -Okay, give it to Thaen. -It'll take two hours for him. Who are you? It's me, the dinosaur speaking. Greetings, my son is not aware of my traits. If he knows, it'll scare him. Silently move to the next room and speak. Sir, it's between a thief and the Police. Why are you troubling the family? Unnecessary! Now see, four innocent souls took the brunt of it. Make sure to mention to my son that I got scared. Okay, sir. ♪ Would the hand that hurts love? ♪ What is it? He would've claimed that I'm not aware of his traits. Also, he would've said I would be scared if I knew. Sir, one minute. The massager fell. Go and fetch it. As you kidnapped him, he stopped at this point. If he knew you threatened me... He will cut you into 32 pieces and scramble it. Only if we stack it as a puzzle could one recognize you. Your best option is to let him go and deal with me. Without causing trouble, give up your boss's name. Sir, you think it's easy. Do you think so? Fine, I'll ask you the hard way. -Sir! -Sir! -Kanaga Lakshmi, how are you? -I'm fine at the moment. What happened? Your son is attracting serious trouble. I'm scared the trouble will land on us too. He is not afraid of anything. In the course of catching a rodent, he will wake up the devil. It's best to adjust to the situation. Don't tell him that I told you. I can understand if you complain that my son is dishonest. I don't know what to do if his honesty comes as a complaint. I can understand your plight. You carry on. I'll speak to him. -Thank you, sir. -Sir, see you. -Sir! -Sir! Is everything okay? Is there a problem? Everything is well. They served biryani. I ate well. Forget about it. You're handling a high-profile case. It'll be best if you don't dig deeper and let it go. Because you have a family to look after. It's best not to poke the bear.

"If the tooth does not grow back, I'll place this tooth back." Until then, he wanted me to safe-keep the tooth. I have locked the tooth in this locket since then. Keep going. Muthu, you're applying brakes, thinking it's the accelerator. Am I? Now watch me. God help me! Phew! I got five more views for my video today. Oh, is it? That means you can have two more idlis. Hello, I could not get beetroot but carrot. Shall we make a video of carrot halwa? I don't know how to make carrot halwa. It's best you get beetroot. The only difference is the color. Both are the same, sir. Don't talk too much, and get home soon. It's not like I can fly. I'll be there soon. Okay bye! Hey! Today it makes the 120th time I almost rammed into you. But I never rammed into you. Still, you are afraid. What if you ram into me 121st time? Instead of getting hurt and admitting to the hospital... I shall pick up the vegetables and go home. You keep running your mouth. One day I'll bump you off the road and pay 5000 rupees fine. Why do you torture me because my grandson asked you not to park in front of the house? You were the one who provoked him. That's why he speaks too much. Do you know what your grandson said when I parked the vehicle? "Don't park in front of my house." "Get a house of your own if you want to park." Mr.Specs! Why would I drive a taxi if I could afford to buy a house? I apologized a hundred times for his behavior. Apologizing does not work for me. Only punishment. Hand me the fruits. Drumsticks for you! What did Bharathiyar quote? "Play well, dear..." "and don't forget to pick up what's on the ground." Now that you picked it up. You may leave. Shall I reverse and bump him? Perhaps next time! The number you're calling is either unreachable or switched off at the moment. -Sir! -Give the phone to the AC. Sir, AC, sir left last night. -Is it?-Yes, sir. He mentioned he had to tend to something and took a cab. Okay. Since last night Arjun did not return home. Not able to reach him over the phone. Call the station and check on him. -Sir!-Do you know where's AC? I'm not able to reach him over the phone. AC, sir, did not inform me. If he calls, please inform him I called. -Sure, I will tell him. -Okay. The number you're calling is either unreachable or switched off at the moment. Please try again... This is one of the rare instances. If the Assistant Commissioner itself goes missing... I don't know what to say. Sir, the last spot, his signal pinged was near Parrys Bridge. His colleagues have mentioned that he was stressed off late. Maybe it is suicide. Any pressure from the family? Nothing of that sort. But I'm surprised to hear you all speak this way. Okay, sir. We'll do our best. But a small request. For a few days, keep this to yourself. Because it will be an embarrassment to the department. I hope you understand. Everyone knows what happened to Arjun. Still, you all pretend and keep looking for him. If you attempt to find anything. People will come looking for us. It's safe if we ignore it. Oh, God, the Assistant Commissioner is missing! I swear, had I been in good shape... I would've come along and looked for him. I heard you both were having issues. Let me know. I can get it resolved. If you got him, please let him go. Or if you know anything, please tell me. Sir, I did warn the AC. Not to look for things that did not concern him. If not, we will have to look for you. But he never listened! Boys, did you do anything to him? The day before, none of you came to work. Where were you all? Brother, I went to the movies with Malliga. He's lying. He must've done it. Because Malliga was with me. -What the hell? -Get lost! Don't worry, sir. We'll find out. We will find out who among the two was with Malliga. Because next week I have a meeting with Malliga. I'll meet her and update you. Mani, see what happened. The senior dinosaur came looking for junior dinosaur. Yeah! Will he find him? They would've made a soup out of him. How long have you been married? It's been eight years. Kids? We have a six-year-old son. Recently did you and AC, sir get into a fight? -No. -Madam? Have you ever witnessed any misunderstanding between them? Does he discuss official matters at home? Any idea if he was in some trouble? Okay, thank you. -Sir. -Sir! Sir, look at them misdirecting it as a suicide case. He's not a person who would commit suicide. He was a crisp and honest officer. Fearless! I did warn the AC not to dig in deep. As our department may have a link to them. You're well aware of the department. They'll keep silent despite knowing the truth. I'm speaking out of experience. History is we never recovered even the corpse of officers who went looking for the statues. It's hurting to say this. AC is dead, sir. What happened, Mom? Had you let him live his life on his terms... he would've been alive today. You raised him to be an honest officer... and now my son is dead! His death... Do you feel, in a way, you're responsible for it? Wow! I usually see you shiver. But now you're standing like a rock. Had I run over, you would've gone flying in the air. I'm in a different mood now. You should step aside. I'm the master of the moods. Don't test me! Where are you going? I'm going to meet Malliga. Malliga? Fine, we're from the same neighborhood. It won't be nice if you walk. Step inside the car. I'll drive you. Sure? Don't be afraid. Get inside the car. I won't hit you. If you don't come, I'll hit you. Fine, I will come. I understood when you bought drumsticks. Playboy! How does Malliga look? Is she pretty? I'd know only after I met her. You never met her. Is she your Facebook friend? Mutual friend! Mutual friend? Oh... Old age does not stop you. Fanatic! I've sent you a request on Facebook. Accept it. I, too, want to be mutual friends with Malliga. Mr.Specs. It smells like you bathed in perfume. She looks fantastic. If she's so hot, I'd like to know how Malliga looks. Hey, I see you! You're ditching me. What did Bharathiyar quote? "Play well, dear..." "But don't ditch your friend who came along." I'll return and take you with me. I'll wait for five minutes. If not, I'll barge in. Godspeed! Seenu, brother, Varma killed three of our men... for someone else's mistake. If it continues... our deaths are confirmed. What's the point of being loyal to him? Brother, please handle it. Tell me, brother. Listen, delete all the voice messages you sent to me. Hereafter, don't send such stuff. Right or wrong, as long as we are loyal to Varma... we can stay alive. I may or not be loyal to Varma, but I'm devoted to my life. Hang up the phone! My men are trying to screw me over. Damn! Did you find your Junior Dinosaur? Your bestie and boyfriend have a birthday on the same day. Whom do you plan on surprising at midnight? My bestie! Why your bestie? Boyfriends keep changing. But besties don't. Supporting your bestie, you nasty! What is it? I thought you were bringing Malliga, but what's with the sack? It's nothing but garbage. We will throw it away on our way back. Could you please open the boot? You don't do such things during the night. Driving with garbage, but he wore perfume. Please pull over to the left. Make it quick! You too come along! Times have changed. Everyone is a cheater. I thought it was garbage but heavy, like a hippo. He lured me with Malliga, but I'm left with drainage. You witnessed my soft side during the night. You'll face my wrath in the morning. I'll run you over inside your house. Why did you switch on the AC without my permission? Now he's feeling cold. What is this? It smells like beetroot. That is blood. Wipe it. It'll come off. Blood? I stabbed over here and slit through. Everything fell out. Everything fell out, you say? -Why did you slit him? -Only then he'll die. He died? Why? I raised my son with love and honesty. As he was honest, they killed him. Your son died too? So, I'm responsible for his death. I kept thinking about it. And I could not take it. He's my son! But how can his killer be happy? So, I decided to kill him. I killed him! They killed your son, and you took your revenge. Okay. But why did you drag me into this? You were irritating me for a while. I decided to kill you someday. With God's grace, you appeared before me today. Still, I thought of sparing you. But when you quoted Bharathiyar... After that, I decided not to spare you. So, I killed him and pinned it on you. Why would you pin it on me? I will go to the Police right away. If you go to the Police station with blood on your hands, they'll surely arrest you. I will wash my hands. Even if you go without your hands, they'll arrest you. Because you asked me to kill him. When did I ask you? But that will be my statement. Oh-oh! Okay, sorry. Apologizing does not work for me. Only punishment. Oh... You remember everything. But I forgot. Bharathiyar! It's a huge thing if an Assistant Commissioner died. Many questions will arise about his death. It's a very sensitive matter. Before the Government puts pressure on us, we must be ready with the answers. Here you go, chocobar. Muthu, buy me ice cream. -Muthu, buy me ice cream. -Okay, calm down. -Come on, come on, come on. -Okay, okay, okay. Come with me. Welcome, sir. What do you want, kid? -Which one do you want? -I want an Orange Bite. -Orange Bite. -Sorry, I ran out of Orange Bite. Muthu, he is lying. He saves it for his favorite kids. You look for it yourself. -What is he saying? -Sir, please look for yourself. I have mango, grape, and chocobar. Orange Bite is out of stock. Kid, I have Butterscotch Cone. No, no, I only want Orange Bite. Look for it, Muthu. He must've hidden it. [Varma] Sir, you killed my man, Seenu, and having ice cream with your grandson. Just a miss! If not, he would've lost his head. You saved him. How many times will you save him? Two times? Ten times? How about a hundred times? Hey, I will repeat it a thousand times. Until I hack your grandson's head and deliver it to you, I won't rest, sir. [In Malayalam] Understood? Poona, play the song. [Taal Se Taal (Taal) - A.R.Rahman] What happened, Muthu? Sir, did Rithvik have his dinner? He's a small kid. Take care of him. You see, in the spur of the moment... I didn't realize who I was up against and killed your man. Please forgive me. I don't want my family to suffer for my personal vengeance. At this point, let's stop everything. That is wrong! Varma will decide the start and the stop. You can't decide it. My mistake. Please forgive me. If Varma spares the guy who killed his men... then my partners will not respect me. But if the news spreads that Varma killed the person mercilessly who killed his men... It will give a boost to my men. And I'll be the talk of the industry. Understood? If I do my job in the right sense is when my workers will do their job religiously. I swear, sir, I'm not doing this as a hobby. 100% professional! Give me an appointment with you. I'll meet you in person... fall on your feet and seek forgiveness. [In Malayalam] Sir, I don't think you get it. Let me tell you in the language you get it. [In Tamil] In every household, the grandfather dies first. But it'll be different in your household. First, your grandson. Then his mother. Then the mother-in-law. Finally, the mother-in-law's husband. That means you! I will come in person to kill you. On that day, you'll get an appointment. [In Malayalam] Understood? Bye! Hey! Hey! Step aside! Hey! Make way! Just a miss, buddy! -He ducked his grandson's head. -Step aside! The knife missed him by an inch in the air. I was embarrassed, you know. Why is the bar crowded like a carnival? Hey, Richie, this is the man I was talking about. He saved his grandson! So to rub it in our noses, he's drinking before us. Hey, are you happy that you saved him? Hey, I'm speaking to you. Old man, do you want snacks? Here you go! Is he getting angry? He's immune to shame. Thought as much! Just because you walk away, I won't spare you. Look at the old man walking so fast. Hey, are you getting angry? Show me your angry face. I want to see. Hey, old man! I've been given the contract to kill your entire family. I'm okay to kill your wife and grandson. But my heart stops me from killing your daughter-in-law. She's hot! So damn hot, Richie! -Give me the hottie. -Don't worry. It's ours! The old man got trapped by walking into an alley. Hey, where are you going? Old man, this man says your daughter-in-law is hot. We are talking ill. Why aren't you getting angry? Please get angry. I want to see your angry face. I would love to see your angry face, sir. Hey, Bala, let us rip him apart! Hey, old man... Are you trying to escape? Hey, turn around! After a point, I don't talk. I only slash! How dare you try to kill my grandson? Oh, no! He wished to see my angry face. Now I am angry. It's a pity he's no more to see my face. Wait, I heard you say something. As you spoke from a distance. I could not hear you. -Repeat it. -I didn't say anything. No, I heard you say something. -Get away from me. -What did you say? -Don't come near me. -Tell me! Don't come near me. Get away! Come on, tell me. Hey! You spoke something about my daughter-in-law. -What did you say? -I didn't say anything. It's okay. You can tell me. Your daughter-- Did you not sleep? Vijaya, please listen to me without getting panicked. What happened? Since Arjun's demise, I'm not able to sleep. I'm always in a panic. I'm afraid of anyone I come across. I'm very disturbed. Could you please take me to a psychiatrist? Looking at his face, I don't see even an ounce of fear. What makes you say that he's afraid? He said it himself. Oh, he said it himself. Who suggested visiting this particular clinic? It's he who suggested it. He knows what he wants. You two, please step outside and wait. The reason why I have a doubt is... A few people commit grave crimes... and come over here to get mentally unfit certificate. I need to check if you fall in that category. You don't need to stress yourself. I'll tell you everything. Please explain in detail. Do you know Chakkarapani? -Who is he? -Dhandayuthapani's father. Oh-oh! Do you know Dhandayuthapani? Sarangapani's father. -Do you know Sarangapani? -Who is he? Dhandapani's father. That means... Your father! -You have a family in the city. -Yes. Also, you have a family on the outskirts that your first family isn't aware of. Oh-oh... As I got all your facts right... Do you still think I'm a patient? No! It's because I'm not a patient. Then why the hell are you here? Doctor, I committed a murder. What did you say? Following that, I committed two more murders. God help me! If my family knows, it'll scare them. If you keep piling on questions... I'm afraid they'll come to know. So, right now, you tell me... if I should commit the fourth murder or not. Hey, please don't jump the gun. When you already found out that I have two families... I decided right away to help you. Tell me what I can do for you. Hereafter, my family will stay at your hospital. I have work to tend to. Once I finish my work, I'll return and take my family. Until I return, maintain that I'm a patient to my family. His mental illness is very dangerous. It's a peculiar disease. People with this illness will behave like a kitten. We can only feed milk to it. Suddenly they'll turn into a tiger! If you feed milk during that transition... he will grab your hand, bite and eat it. Suddenly he will turn into a snake. During that time, you need to-- Doctor, how do we know when will the transitions happen? Correct! Starting tomorrow, I'm going to conduct classes. You need to stay here and attend classes. Any doubts? Chandra Kumar! The AC's family travelled in this car. Take a look at the car and let me know where they went. AC's death has stirred a storm in the department. And now you're behind his family. Yeah, right! We, too, don't know. Well, I know you people. The department knows that you people don't know anything. I work for you without the knowledge of the department. Still, I'm doing it for our friendship. I know it. You don't have to remind me. Please go ahead and find them for me. Okay, I'll check on it. I'll take my leave. I'll end up in hell, consistently lying to my wife. Then you shouldn't have got married. -Tell me. -Hello! Where are you? Please come, your coffee is ready. Oh, no! Where am I? Oh, no! I kept walking and came too far. I am still determining where I am. Did you say you don't know where are you? Pass the phone to someone near you. Erm... there's no one near me. -But there's a man a bit far from me.-Please give him the phone. Wait, I'm passing the phone. -Who are you? -Hello, sir. He's mentally ill at the moment. I think he walked too far. It'll be helpful if you could tell me where he is now. In fact, he lost his way and arrived in Bangalore. -Where did you say?-Yes! -Bangalore?-Yeah! Dharmalingam! In the world, people should always carry a smiling face. That will help you fight any disease... -and overcome sickness. -Doctor! Doctor! He lost his way and went to Bangalore. -I'm confused. Please speak to him. -Oh, God! -Hello... -Doctor! I am headed to Bangalore to attend to work. Until I return, manage the situation. -Okay? -Totally understand, bro! Don't worry. I suggested he go on a long walk. I think he strolled on the Bangalore highway. Thus he arrived in Bangalore. He will return in no time. You don't worry. Hello! Sir, anyhow you've arrived in Bangalore. Please buy two kilos of Rasagulla from Commercial Street. Just for me. Okay! Here you go. You relax! And guys, you continue smiling. You should always be smiling. "Smile-O-Therapy." Hey! [In Kannada] I'm speaking to you. But you keep walking away. Arrogance, is it? [In Tamil] I need to see your Boss. Oh, you're from the Thriuvalluar state! Get out! Come on, scram! -Hey, step back. -Hey! [In Kannada] How dare you point a knife at his face? Shekara! Switch on the fan. [In Tamil] He did not do it on purpose. Please spare him. How could he not know? He should know! Shekar, increase the fan speed to 2. He might puke. Please spare him. Shekar! -Increase the speed to 3. -Sir! Please don't feel sorry for me. I will keep spinning at the speed of 2. Please proceed with the purpose of your visit. You'd be doing a favor to me. Narasimha, I had asked you for a favor. -Is it ready? -Ready, sir! Narasimha, I hope helping me won't cause you trouble. Sir, don't embarrass me. It's because of you I reformed and surrendered to the court. Also, you helped me reduce my sentence. After that, I reformed... And now I only help people in need. You changed my life. It's the least I could do. -Shall we go, sir? -Yeah, let's go. -Shall we start, sir? -Yeah! Okay, sir. Good! Sir, they are the four shooters. My most skilled and loyal men. Well-trained fighters and snipers. [In Kannada] Listen, onward. I'm not your Boss. He's your Boss! You will do everything he says. Okay, Boss! [In Tamil] Sir, let's have a meal and discuss this further. Will these four be in the same attire all the time? No, tomorrow they'll be in a different attire. Seenu brother. Varma killed three of our men for someone else's mistake. If it continues... our deaths are confirmed. What's the point of being loyal to him? Brother, please handle it. I sent the voice message to you by mistake. Actually... I should've sent it to him. You should not stand up while having your meal. Meet me after your meal. I'll wait for you in that room. Sir, I'm telling the truth. I told you everything I know. I only know the travel route of the statue. I don't know the details about the vehicle. How do you not know? Hey, how do we find out? Do you expect us to wave at every vehicle on the road? That's a great idea! Who? Brother, the statue fell down. Hey, the statue fell down. As time goes by, the statue is getting heavier. Brother, the statue fell down. Hey, chameleon face, please! Hey, mosquito face. Does this statue belong to you? Is the vehicle here? Only if you tell us, we'll be ready. I'll inform once the vehicle arrives. Block the road! [sings a devotional song] Lorry. Hail Hanuman! Please, hold on! Hold on, please. Stop-- Stop the lorry. -Sorry! -What is it? A statue fell from your vehicle. Hey, this is a milk tanker. Milk tanker... Brother, since the morning I'm standing on the road. Please make me a cup of coffee. Shall I lay you down and run over? No death, only coffee! You carry on. I'll find another vehicle. -Moron! -God, please punish him! Hello-- Hello, driver! Hey, hey, hey! Is this your statue? Hey, at least give me a sugarcane. Statue fell down! Statue fell down! Excuse me, bro! Statue fell down! Check if it belongs to you. Hello! Hey, everyone, alert! Something is fishy. The lorry is reversing. -Brother... -What is it? The statue fell off, brother. -Raghu!-Tell me. Did a statue fall off the vehicle? -Statue? Ours is a metal frame. -Hey... It's confirm. This is the vehicle. Block the road! Here's a man holding a statue... and asking if it fell off the vehicle. He looks suspicious. Sir, please go behind and give them the statue. He's coming to you. Grab him. The driver uncle asked me to give you the statue. Here you go, uncle! Grandpa! Doctor... [In Malayalam] The family of this man in the picture is in this hospital. Where are they? This man has committed three murders. Daylight murders! So, I won't tell you. -How many murders? -Three murders! How many murders do you think have I committed? Excluding the Doctor, the count is ninety-six. Ninety-six? That makes you the winner. Stand up, head to your right, and then the second room on the left. [In Malayalam] Proceed with your business. Sir, if you hide your family 150 kilometers away... do you think I can't find them? You're embarrassing me, sir. Is that all you know about me? It's humiliating, sir. I'm very hurt. Actually, I wanted to hack your grandson's head and deliver it to you. As you hurt me... I'm going to give you a LIVE experience. -Isn't this the room? -Yes. [In Malayalam] Sir, watch now. Varma, that's our statue. Lean back. Did I lose the signal? The camera froze! No, no. I can see your leg shaking. The signal is good. [In Malayalam] Not an issue, sir. Just a loss of ten crores. To hell with the loss! Next week I'll capture your consignment from Mysore to Hyderabad. The following week I'll capture the consignment from Madurai too. Is it true? How do you know the schedule? Sir, how could you underestimate me? Is that all you know about me? You're humiliating me. I'm hurt, sir. I don't want to talk to you. He's calling back. [In Malayalam] Sir, we'll arrive at a settlement. I won't disturb your family anymore. And you release my statue. How can I let it go so easily? Isn't it wrong to attempt to kill my family? As retribution... you need to get ten rupees from my family as alms. Alms, as in, I don't get it! Think hard you'll get it. What does alms mean? He's asking you to beg, Varma. Ma! Ma! It's been ten days since I ate. Please spare me ten rupees as alms. How can you come inside a private premises and beg? I'm dying of hunger. Please spare me ten rupees. It'll be a good virtue. You will live a good life. Please spare me ten rupees. I'm dying of hunger. He's begging for ten rupees. Had he asked earlier, the security at the gate would've given him 100 rupees. Bloody beggar! Please spare me ten rupees. You look healthy! Why can't you work and buy your food? As he's hungry, he's begging for money. -And you're preaching to him. -Please make her understand. -Here you go, uncle. Please eat. -Thank you. -Hey! Hey! -Be Blessed, kid. Old currency! Partner! Shall we take the ten rupees, drop it in the charity box and forgive him? Poor thing had to beg for it. Let's forgive him. Because my partner said so, I spared your life. -Oh, no! -Go! That's it, sir. [In Malayalam] I won't disturb your family anymore. Neither should you disturb my business. [In Malayalam] Understood? I'll take my leave. Please, sir. One minute. After compromising now... if you come back with your men to create any problems... I will hack you into small pieces and scatter it. Later it'll take ten days to arrange everything to identify your body. [In Malayalam] Understood? [In Malayalam] I understood! Hold on another minute. Partner... Do you wish to quote Bharathiyar to him? Oh, God no! Not to him. Actually, I need to tell you something. Shall I relieve him? For God's sake! My partner is not in the mood. You may leave. You should not tie up your veshti. Leave it be. I don't want the veshti, sir. Hey, neither should you overdo it. Nor should you underdo it. You should only do what you are told. Return exactly as you arrived. Varma, how dare he harass us? Varma, this is wrong. How can you let it happen? You are shameless! -Don't provoke him. -You shut up, Paneer! I know what I am doing. You don't mess up things. Varma will handle it himself. You shut up. He is completely alright. Just follow my prescription. One important thing... Please don't come back to this hospital. Greetings! It's enough you say it once... Hey, brother, brother, brother! Brother, don't do it. We did not do anything. [In Malayalam] First time in my life, someone blackmailed me. You people are the reason for it. I will kill you guys. I will kill him too. Drop them! Kamdev, could you do a job for me? It has to be done tomorrow night. And it should be at his place. Don't shoot. Cut him into pieces. Torture and cut him into pieces. Cut him into as many pieces as you can. Viji! What is it? I need to talk to you. We'll talk in the morning. I'm sleepy now. You won't be here in the morning to listen. What is it? Are you afraid? Do you need any medicines? If you need any tablets, bring them along to the dining table. -What happened? -I don't know. He called me. No matter what happens now... I want you both to sit tight like you've been nailed to the chair without any movement. We will make sure to do it. Now come to the point. Remember a man who killed our son? What would you do if you encountered him? Tell me. He killed my son! If I encountered him, I'll stab him and kill him. -How does it matter now? -Why didn't you do it? How could she kill a person? As you're not capable of it... you did not do it. I was capable of doing it. And I did it. What are you rambling about? Hey! I told you not to stand up. Sit down! I heard a vehicle outside. I know. People are here to kill us. I don't understand. What you said earlier was correct, Viji. I raised him to be an honest person, so he got killed. I'm one of the reasons for Arjun's death. I'm not able to take it when I think about it. He's my son! That is why I killed the man who killed Arjun. Following it, I killed two to three more people. Now you're scaring me! What if they harm our family? Don't worry. Nothing will happen to our family. Only they will be harmed! [In Hindi] Duck down and walk. Wipe it. It'll come off. [In Hindi] This way. Hereafter, if we wish to live... We need to be in a position to take lives. What I'm trying to say is... You're not allowed to give advice here. Just listen to what I say. Hey! Can't you see I'm talking to you? Where is your focus? Focus on my face! [In Hindi] Get to the back entrance. Why don't we... stop everything after this point? I went too far. I can only return when I'm done with everything. Just push it! You think this is scary. It has just begun! All this while you never mentioned anything. -Why suddenly today? -Hey! Oh, no! What did you ask me earlier? I was saying... All this while you never mentioned anything.

[In Kannada] This is how it works over here. You continue cleaning. [In Hindi] Add more gunpowder to it. More, I say! Dada, you got a call. [In Hindi] The men you sent got killed. Jailer! Inform Varman. [In Tamil] None of the men I sent yesterday are alive. Hey, so you sent frail men for the job. Correction, the man you asked me to kill is stronger. I would've never sent my men if you told me, it was him. It doesn't matter if you send your men or not. I asked Sikander Singh from Punjab to send 100 men. His men would've mercilessly cut him into pieces! I know they will cut. But do you know for sure... if they will cut him or you? Why don't you call Sikander now? Call Sikander Singh! Six! [In Hindi] Get lost! Is he disconnecting your call? Hereafter, he won't pick up your call. [In Hindi] Sikander is an amateur before him. He doesn't have the guts to send men to kill him.

Solid power! [In Malayalam] Let's sit down and discuss. Don't you understand? [In Tamil] Shall we sit down and discuss? [In Malayalam] Sit down. -Hey, Poona! -Sir... Pull out the chair for sir. Sit down. -Chase away the others. -Okay, sir. Everyone scram! Sir, why don't you rest your weapon on the table? That's a deadly tool, sir. I won't kill you. [In Malayalam] If I kill you... your men will kill me. I'm now well aware of it. Tiger Muthuvel Pandian No Policeman mentioned that you have such a deadly flashback. Thank goodness. Your son is alive because he's a Policeman. I knew I could use it at a later point. But never did I dream that he would save my life. It's God's grace! Fine... I'll forgive and forget. Give me back my son. [In Malayalam] If I give you back your son... the next second, you'll kill me. I am aware... that you have a wide network of contacts throughout India. I am well aware! Let go of my son. I won't harm you. I need some time to think, sir. -Hey, Poona! -Sir! -Until I decide, entertain, sir. -Sure, sir. [Kannodu Kanbathellam (Jeans) - A.R.Rahman] Why are you guys dancing? Did Varman die? Varma! You're sitting like a rock! No one can mess with Varma! How dare you try to lock Varman? Are you shocked? Enjoy the dance. That's enough. Get out! Sir, I've been in this business for forty years. Since childhood, I have a desire. It's not just a small desire, but a big one. Over an item. That's my life's target. There's a popular temple in Andhra. During the 16th century, Chhatrapati Shivaji gifted a crown to the deity in the temple. During the 18th century, even the Britishers could not take it. Because it's a high-value antique piece. I want that crown. Bring me the crown and take your son. Hey, it's a sin to steal a temple's property. You will be destroyed! Ask for something else. Sir, I don't like sentiments. I only want the crown! [In Malayalam] I'm not in a hurry, sir. Take your time. You will get your son. And I will get my crown. That's the deal! You're taking a huge risk. Despite knowing that my son is alive, if I don't save him, calling myself his father has no meaning. Fine, you want information on the crown. The crown you mentioned is at a temple in Andhra. Until now, ten gangs have tried to steal that crown. The gangs that attempted are safely locked up in prison. The crown is guarded by foolproof security. It's a National Treasure. Even to see it in person... other than the Indian President and Prime Minister... only five people have access to it. Who are the five people? Amitabh Bachchan Ratan Tata Sachin Tendulkar Swami Gopinath Saraswathi And Blast Mohan! These five people are the temple's Honorary Trustees. Did you say, Blast Mohan? He's an impatient enthusiast! Do you know him? Not just me. The entire country knows him. In cinema, he's a serious comedian. In reality, he's a comedic, serious guy. To sum up, he's an Instagram irritation! Hopeless fellow! How did they make him a trustee? A family member is always one of the trustees. History states the land belongs to the family's legacy. It's a long bloodline. Like a legacy of a King. But this guy in the name of cinema is making a fool of himself. But the funny part is handling Blast Mohan is difficult than the others. Even he does not know what he will do and when he will. He complained about the noise the bomb makes during the blasts in the quarry. Is there a bomb that does not make a noise? No! Take care of his ears so that he can't hear anymore. Okay, Babu. He filed a case to stop you from acting. Oh! Play him all my movies four times. For one year! He gave bad reviews to our films on YouTube. Here's an advance of ten lakhs. You're the director of my next film. The film should be a huge hit. If a reviewer like you trolled the film... you'll be dead. [In Malayalam] What is it, sir? Hey, I thought about it well. I will bring you the crown. But it will take three months. Until then, my son should be safe. [In Malayalam] Sir, your son will be unharmed. I guarantee! You take your own time. But one condition. Two of my men will be with you 24/7. To keep a tab on you and your activities. Also, sir... I will only believe what they say. A precaution so that your criminal mind does not play tricks. If you agree to these conditions, everything will be okay. We are heading to Hyderabad for work. Until I return, keep my family safe and keep me posted. Okay? Okay. [sings a Telugu song] [In Telugu] Your fights have become a routine now. -[In Telugu] Why are you late? -Buffalo delayed it. -Okay, scram! -Gpay right away. I'll do it. Get lost! Meeting at 05:00 p.m. After two months of following and snooping, we discovered this. This man is madly in love with this woman. But this woman loves this man a lot. Care to explain? He passed off this man's gifts as his to this woman and impressed her. Now these two are in love. Is Blast Mohan aware of it? On the day he finds out... either he will blast these two to death. Or he will blast himself to death. Do you believe that the actions of this man are wrong? A big fat wrong! Tell me, Varma. Hey, what's happening out there? Blast Mohan is in love with Kamna. But Kamna is in love with someone else. Kamna? Who's Kamna? The Kamna who features in... ♪ Adada Mazhaida Ada Mazhaida ♪ [song from film, Paiya] Bloody beggar! Give the phone to Paneer! Give him the phone. -Tell me, Varma.-What's happening there, Paneer? One minute. What did you tell him? I told him Kamna from (Adada Mazhaida). Idiot! Varma! ♪ Thanjavoor Jillakari ♪ [song from Suraa] Hey, did you go there for a heist or something else? Varma, it's confusing with so many actors in the cinema.

Won't you ask me what I want? -What do you want? -Your lip balm. You gave her a ring worth 1.5 crores... and in return, he gets a 150 rupees lip balm. Hey, this is priceless! From her lips to mine.

He's not the right person for you. I totally get what you're trying to say. But see, I have fame and money. I achieved whatever I wanted in my life. What I want now... ...is a person who takes care of me. A trusted man who truly loves me. So, I'm okay with him. If you're okay, then I'm okay. Hey, suddenly, I thought of a scene. I want to write. You, please leave. You write. I'll be in a corner having fun. Some fun, you say! If you're in the room, my mind is refracting. You get out. Come on, leave. What is refraction? Alexa, what is refraction? [Alexa] In physics... refraction is a re-direction of a wave as it passes from one medium to another. Is it the seventh floor? That's right. Okay... I'm out of the lift and on your floor in the corridor. Is your door unlocked? It's open. Please come. The room opposite yours suddenly opened the door. That room is still open. Really? No one should see me entering your room. Please do something about it. Else I'm going back to the room. Wait! I'll check on it right away. Hi Dhivya. Hi! Why is your door open? Someone might get inside your room. It's not safe. Please close the door. It's okay. We're on alert. Even if someone barges in we can handle it. Is the gym on this floor? What floor is it? It's the same floor you chose inside the lift. Oh... I think I'm on the wrong floor. [sings a rousing Tamil song] Are you my fans? Do you want a selfie? Please come. We'll take a selfie with the madam when she arrives. Madam? Which madam? Why would she come here? -Hi. -Hi... -Hi! -Hi... Hey! If you don't hear us out... madam will be walking all night up and down. She could never get inside the room. Damn you, man! Had you asked, I would've left. But you said refraction and reaction... and pushed me out in wet underwear. Even Alexa did not know refraction and got confused. Okay, does Blast Mohan know about the refraction matter? Traitor! Listen, if you don't want his matter to leak... you need to meet our Boss. He looks like Godfather. Balu, your death is inevitable! Shall we sit down and discuss this? [In Telugu] How are you? How are you, Balu? I'm good, sir. How is your family doing? Don't make garbage in the name of commercial film. Make a film that's a wholesome family entertainer. Don't shoot day and night. It'll affect your health. If you lose health. You lose everything. Is Blast Mohan aware of your affair? He does not know, sir. He does not know. He does not know. Would it be okay if Blast Mohan knew about your affair? -I just knew, and I'm not okay. -Why? It's obvious. All this while he claimed the film was his life. Suddenly he claims Kamna is his wife. It pisses me off! Blast Mohan will be outraged. After that, he won't have a head to wear a wig. If you want to keep this matter hidden from Blast Mohan... hereafter you should do whatever I ask of you. You should not even deflect by a fraction. Sir, how do I... Can you or not do it? I will do it, sir. I will, as you say. Please, switch on the light. [In Telugu] If you do as I say... How are you, Balu? It will remain good. If you don't, then you're doomed! -Sir! -Do you understand? I understood. Tell me, Varma. What's happening out there? I won't say. If I do, you'll yell at me! I won't yell. Tell me. Everyone must be tense to know if Blast Mohan would accept, "How are you, Balu?" story. Bloody senseless moron... Do you think working as a spy is as easy as murdering someone? If you continue being a jerk... I will go to Blast Mohan's house and end me. Everything will be messed up! Mind your tongue. You've been frying my brain. Hey, why are you yelling at him? You'd realize when you sit on someone's lap. I'm okay with the story you narrated. But the film should be a sure-shot hit. It will definitely be a hit! I stand guarantee! As I narrated in real life, the crown is at Adhi Narayana Temple. If I do a recce with my team... I can shoot it naturally. And a National Award is confirmed. -Ramprasad. -Babu. Who do we approach to see the crown in person? It's enough that you approach yourself. You're one of the trustees of the temple. Make arrangements. Okay, where's madam in this story? How can she not be in it? Only if madam is in it, the director will work. He meant to say you will act only if madam is in the film. He said it wrong... He's telling it wrong. -How does he know? -He's always with us. He noticed. Did you notice? -[In Telugu] How are you? -I'm good. I'm coming from Treasurer Blast Mohan's office. I know who you are. That's the director and his assistant. -Srini take down measurements. -Okay, sir. You will have to recreate a set as original as this one. Worth! Worth! Worth! All our hard work is paid off, Varma. -Worth! -Did you see it? It was out of the world. Mind-blowing! Truly mind-blowing! Give the phone to Paneer. Oh, open your mouth, baby. Varma, I saw the crown. For forty years, I only heard about it. Today I was four feet away from it. Since I saw it, my body is wobbling. You start working on safekeeping the crown once we steal it. I'll call you tomorrow morning. God, everything should go well. [In Malayalam] If someone tries to seize my container... I'm eager to know who did it. [In Tamil] I've been asking you for ten minutes. I can't ask you sweet enough. Tell me, who planned to nab my container? [In Malayalam] If I confess they will kill me, sir. If you don't confess... do you think I'll take you for dinner? Silly boy! [In Hindi] Damn you, boy... I know that you won't confess either. [In Hindi] Sir... Sir... It was Kareem's plan. He asked us to do it. Kareem? Bloody, don't lie to me! [In Tamil] I swear, it was Kareem's plan. It was Kareem's plan. I'm surprised. Even after he's dead, you claim it's Kareem. That confirms it's Kareem's plan. Sir, your friend is here to meet you. Wash your face clean and eat before you leave. -Sir! -Mathew! It's been a long time since I met you. I told you I'll come and meet you. Why did you come so far? I need a favor. I should come to you. -Please sit down. -Sit down. I collected all the details you require. As you mentioned... it's quite a difficult job to steal the crown. Because the Government is closely watching the crown. Suppose you go in and get caught... you will never see the light of the day. Instead, the guy who asked you to steal the crown... killing him would be easy. Take a look. If you say the word... they'll shoot him from three different directions No! No, no. No, Mathew. I already mentioned it to you. My son is with him. This would put my son's life in danger. Things will go wrong. I don't care for the risk. I will steal the crown myself. I totally understand. How about killing them? They have entrusted me. If you say so. Excuse me. -Can I use the western bathroom? -Yes! Thank you. As a precaution, I will keep him under my radar. It may be useful later. Anyway, I have everything ready you asked for. Let's go and check it out. Thanks, Mathew! Anytime for you, sir. I have never seen such a location in Andhra. Why did you put up the location over here? I don't want anything getting leaked. It's a reference to a Hollywood film. If you see, you'll understand. What's so awesome about it? The light strikes in multiple directions... but he dodges it and smoothly goes around. That's awesome! No matter how he moves, they're pointing the light without touching him. Now that's awesome!

Just like the reference video... dodge the laser lights, jump over, climb up, and pick up the crown. God help him! The lights are hitting him all over. I pity him. He will die for the sake of your love. Traitor! [In Telugu] Fantastic, sir. Cut! Cut! Go! Action, sir! In the Adhi Narayana Temple treasure vault CCTV footage... you need to insert this footage. It can't be done, sir. Five lakhs! The size of the work does not matter. In the end, it's my duty. Please give it to me. I'll do it! Hello, emergency! [In Telugu] Connect me to the local Police station. We are from CBI. Do you want a donation? We're not here for a donation. We want the crown you stole. Did you say gown? Whose gown? I said crown, not a gown. -Vasu, show him the clip. -Yes, sir. That is Blast Mohan! Realistic performer. [In Telugu] Hey, this is cinema footage. Ramprasad, who is the cameraman? We gave them fifty lights. Not even one was used. -Hello! -Damn it! It's the original CCTV footage from the temple. What? We will have to arrest you if you don't confess to the truth. Do you have the guts to arrest me? Hey, call the Prime Minister. We're here on PM's office orders. It's a religious issue. A very sensitive matter. No one will come forward to help you. -You only have one option. -What is it? We are bringing the crown to Pune to verify its authenticity. If it's the original, you are safe. If it's fake, then you're doomed! Until we return, you're under house arrest. You are not allowed to do anything without our permission. How did this happen? -Hey! -Babu! -Where's the director? -He absconded! The phone is switched off. [In Telugu] How come you did not abscond? Just a miss, Babu! Before I could abscond, they caught me. To hell with you guys! Pick it up. Pick it up! Dhanraj, are the officers inside are original CBI? You should check once. Correct! It was on my mind. Let them get out. I'll check. Hey! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop it! Are you CBI? Show me your identity card. Can you read what does it say? -Hey! -Sir? -Take him in custody. -Okay, sir. [In Hindi] Sorry, officers, I apologize! [Varma] Tell me! Hello, Varma. It's confirmed they're CBI. I realized it after I got whacked by them. All the officers are discussing about the crown. That too in Bengali language. I think the crown is coming out. Panju, crawl forward. Panju, stay down. Panju, stay down! Stay down! Just focus on the target. Tango, Charlie, topple the Jeep and take cover. Anju, shoot! Until I say, there should be no activity. All of you stay down! Sir... I don't mind losing my life. I will kill every one of them. No, no, no! -Hey, Sanju. -Sir! -Bring the vehicle. -Okay, sir. Listen, we got your package. I will send it through your men. Once you receive the package... as discussed before send my son to my place. Don't you dare to play dirty tricks? I'll do it as we discussed. First, send across my crown. Your son will come to you. He will come home safe. This is Varman's promise. Boys, play over. Relax! Acting is a tough job. Timing should be in sync with shots fired, and blood splatter. Also, have to pretend to die. This is too much work, sir. Instead of pretending to steal... we could've stolen the original crown. That would've been easier. I'm not a thief to steal. I'm a Police! You're right about it! -Is everything okay, sir? -All well! Good job, Jafar. Thank you, sir. It's a team effort. -Thank you. -Anytime for you, sir. -Boys! -Yes, sir. We're calling from CBI. Sorry for troubling you, sir. After examination, it's confirmed that the crown is original. Also, it's proved that footage is shooting footage. Sorry, sir. I asked you to be the mediator for my love. But you turned me into the mediator for your love. Traitor! Remove it! Remove the wig! I said remove the bloody wig! How dare you don Pawan Kalyan's hairstyle? Wig head! Die! Go ahead! Blind love... I've gifted you many things. Now I'm giving you away as a gift. Go! Dhivya! Hey, everyone, scram. We have special work. Keep walking, don't stop. Hurry up! Keep walking. Hey, place the table in the middle and leave. Hello, Jailer's son! The Jailer is very powerful. I have to say your father is mighty. I told you this in the beginning. If my father set his heart on it, he would do anything. Had you agreed to the 50% I demanded... we could've become partners and carried out many operations like it. It looks great. I did not seek you out for four and a half years... to arrest you and get a medal. But to join hands in the business. Instead, you kidnapped and locked me in here... and tortured me for six months. It neither benefited you nor me. Don't get too excited that you got the crown. Because without my help, you can't take this anywhere. Why would I need your help anymore? If my father came forward and gave you something, he must surely have a back up plan to take it back from you. My father would've encountered many criminals like you. But his only weakness is me. The trust he has in me. If I use the trust and divert him... the perks of this crown... can be shared by all. If not... he will bury you all with the crown. You have no other option but making me your 50% partner. What do you say, 50-50? Right? Varma, he's right. You don't know about his father. We've observed him in person. As he says, split the bounty in equal halves... and working together is a great idea. First, I'll go and patiently speak to my father and divert him. After that, I'll let you know how to proceed. Meanwhile... anything could happen. My father may get suspicious. If he gets suspicious and cracks it... Don't hesitate because he's my father. I hope you understand. My father and I are different from each other. To him, honesty and righteousness is important. I want to lead a happy life. For that money is important. If anyone interferes in my plan... even if it's my father. I don't like it. He lived his life on his terms. Hereafter, I want to live my life on my terms. [Vijaya] Hello, listen... I want to go to the temple because it is Arjun's birthday. Why don't you come home today? Why are you behaving differently? Dad... How are you? If not for you, I don't know what would've happened to me. I never expected that you'd come to rescue me. I'm blessed to have a father like you. I feel like meeting, Mom, Ritu, and Shwetha. Why did you bring me here? Come on, let's go home, Dad. Sure. We'll go. You look exhausted. Let's sit down and discuss. -You may go outside. -Okay, sir. I rescued you from a dangerous gang. I'm sure you were followed. If we head straight home... it would put the family in danger. I already spoke to the DGP. Tomorrow morning we'll meet the DGP. You narrate everything that happened to you. Only after we trace out the gang and arrest them... we can return home. That'll be safe for us. Okay, Dad. I'm feeling weird. I'll take a rest and speak in the morning. Arjun! Do you have anything you'd like to tell me? I told you everything Dad. -Paneer... -Varma! ...please come. -What is it, Varma? -Talk to him. Hello! The crown you sent for testing is a fake. It failed all the tests. No! We oversaw the entire process. They tried to create a fake as good as the original. But it's not an original. Not just here. No matter how many tests you run, it won't pass the quality check. Because it's clearly a fake. I can assure you the crown is not a fake. We checked it thoroughly. Please check again. We have checked it multiple times. Fake? It's totally fake! You worked with me all along, yet you delivered a fake. Dhanraj! You're my friend. A very close friend. But I'm a professional. 100% professional! If you kill me, I will die for real. I'll kill myself, Varma. Take care! Dad... For four and a half years... I have worked hard to discover every one involved in this case. Anything could've happened to me during the process. I could have died. That's obvious. But if you get involved, it would appear as if I solved it under your shadow. I will lose the due credit I deserve from the department. Please give me a week. I will discover the entire network and solve the case. It would be best if you could stay away from this case until I resolve it. Please, Dad, for my sake. Okay, son. Okay. As a precaution, keep it with you. Arjun! Do you have anything you'd like to tell me? I told you everything Dad. Hello, my father found out everything-- [Varma] Not over the phone. It may get tapped. We'll discuss this in person. Are you trying to scare me? My father asked me to give a statement to the Police. If I give the statement to the Police... it would further complicate the situation. I will handle it all. But first, let me tell you two important things. What is it? The crown your father sent is a fake. Fake? Despite knowing it's fake, what the hell are you doing? What the heck were you doing? I agree it's my mistake. I have something else important to share with you. Remember a pink color diamond in the center of the crown? Inside it is a small camera. Camera? You know what it means. Your father watched everything that happened out here. He must be aware that his son is a thief. We can expect him anytime if he has sent me over here. First, lock my family. That'll be our leverage to escape from him. I'm already on it. I have sent men to lock your family. I transferred all the antiques to another place. Only you're left to handle. How can he give me a fake crown and take his original son? So, I'm going to kill you. And escape before Jailer gets here. I did warn you that he will come. Come on! Come! Come on! Come on! Jailer, I know this is nothing to you. I have something else for you. Look! Look, I have your family. If you leave, I'll spare them. Are you leaving now? Or shall I hack their heads? There will be a third person over there. You mean your grandson! Hey, kill the kid too.

There's a world of criminals that follows me, Jailer! It's a large network! It's hard to predict who might come for you and when they might do so. Your life will turn into hell. Last warning! Drop everything now and... ...go! [In Malayalam] Understood? Jailer! You may have defeated me. But your son... He's the worst criminal than me. At least now, do you have anything to say? If the children turn evil... parents' lives turn into hell. Dad, I did not do it for myself. You, Mom, Shwetha, Ritu, I did it for everyone's benefit. I did it for everyone! I won't repeat this mistake. Please forgive me. Okay, son... confess to the department all your crimes and surrender yourself. Surrender? What are you saying? Dad, how can I surrender myself? Did you consider the damage it would bring to your honor? What would the department think of me? Did you even think about Mom, Ritu and Shwetha? I can't do it, Dad. I can't surrender myself. You have to surrender! You have no other option. Oh! Fine... Even I don't see it happening otherwise. You have always been an inspiration to me. And I... love you... ...so much! Only you and I know about this matter. If you're out of the picture... this matter will end for good. I'm sorry, Dad. Why does your locket look different? When your father was young, he lost a tooth. I have locked the tooth in this locket since then.
