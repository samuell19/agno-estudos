Son, come on out. This is it, I'm sure of it. I found it. Oh. An unlabeled tape again. No, I'm sure this is it. Come on out and watch it with us. It's important. Besides, you stay in there any longer, you'll perma-shrink that impressive wiener. Dad! My son, Thib-a-doe the prude. TIB-a-doe, Dad. TIB-a-doe. I know. Don't be so thouchy. Can't believe we're finally going to see this thing. Hang on, had to get a beer to honor the end of my beloved bike. So it's for your motorcycle, not the guy who died? Of course I feel for him, son, but I'm not sad I walked away. Him in a four-by-four, me on old Raquel, and I walked away. That bike saved me somehow, and that's a miracle worth seeing. Come on, Tibby, sit by us. No, I'm good. No wonder there was a wreck. Hanky honey, this isn't the tape you wanted. This is the other tape. Sweet shitcakes. This is even better, son. Settle back. This is gonna be a real treat. I'd better get a refill. You want me to watch porn with you? I know, it's not your kind of porn... but just be patient and try not to let all that pussy freak you out. I wonder what other, less insane families are doing. Don't be that way, son. These are friends of ours. Roger and Janis. That's Janis on top. So some friends of yours just got together one night and said hey, let's make a porno? This was when we were living in L.A., of course. Of course. You know Ed, Tibby. He passed out in your room during that one party at the house in Marin. Ed knew some people in the businessthe porno business... so the gang got together and put on a show. What's with the costumes, anyway? It's a fairy story. "The Princess and the Penis." That sound means it's almost time. Time for what, another act of limp-dick theater? There's something coming up you'll find even more interesting. Dad, this is all just a little... ick. Tibby, have we ever told you how we had you? How you had me? Oh, kind sir, long have I longed for the prince to claim me for his princess. But he will not have me! Isn't mommy pretty, honey? He is a fool not to see your virtues. Wait a minute. Holy fuck. The holiest, son. The holiest. Yeah, it's a little messed up, I guess. A little? You guess? Look at me, Steve. You can actually see the psychological scars. So did you watch old Hank and Stormy do it? No, Mas, I didn't cozy up next to my parents and watch them conceive me. I just assumed, since you didn't leave the room when they started watching porn. The man has a point. I can't leave the room every time they say or do something horrifying. They just call me a drama queen. If the tiara fits. Fuck you. It's all yours, baby. Careful, Mas. One of these days I might say yes. Call your cock-tease bluff. Band name. My new lady wouldn't approve anyway. Unless she could watch. School just started. You already hooked up? Who is she? Cynthia. With a capital "sin." Super-hot Cynthia? Cortez's chick? Not any more. How are you still standing? The school cool kid doesn't scare me. Even if he did, the backseat magic is totally worth it. Which is why you're hanging out with us. She's at cheerleader pep-squad band camp practice girl-thing something. Tonight's another story. You want me to tape us for you, Tib? Pass. Don't want to watch sex, don't want to talk about sex. Don't think I even want to have sex. Now or ever? Maybe ever. It just makes people act weird. Tomas. Would you two boys like me to leave? So you can work out your dormant and/or latent homosexuality, as the case may be. Yes. We need our "us" time. And we're done. So you decided what college you're going to yet, Mas? Hells yeah. Santa Barbara, baby. So not a real college then. Says the homey going to State. Steve, explain to me why your chosen college is better just because it's not on a beach. Fewer distractions, for one. Honestly, Steve, you could use a few distractions. Unless you've sworn off sex too. Not intentionally. Is Cynthia still keeping your motor running, Mas? Yeah, but we're about to hit a critical juncture. Her birthday's next weekend. If I don't get her the right present and make her birthday perfect... how am I gonna stay in her vagina's good graces? Let me draw you a picture. Sorry, but I don't have much use for sex advice from a gay virgin. No. Literally. Do you have a pic of Cynthia? Tib, that would rock. She would open wide, baby. Ah, true love. This will do. I'll start tonight and have it framed by Thursday. Wow. Thanks, man. It'll be great, Mas. Tib did my mom for Christmas a couple years ago. I'm going to be quiet now. There's the man using those magic hands. Take it easy, Cortez. Why don't you take a shot at that? He's not taken anymore. How is Cyn City? Not to be ungrateful, but your artwork may have been too good. She's all over me now. How horrible that must be for you. No, I mean, it's starting to get a little cramped. - Cramped? - Permanent. Like, I was going to take her to Santa Barbara over Thanksgiving break. But now that feels kind of like a honeymoon commitment or something. I see. You can stop gloating about your unencumbered chastity. Band name. So what are you doing for Thanksgiving? Something involving tofurkey, I suspect. Come down South with me. With you and Cynthia? No, the Mas-mobile's a two-seater. If you go, she can't. And you can check out the campus. I don't need to check out the campus. But you could. Think about it. Beach-side. You and me. And a thousand beautiful women. And a lot of hot guys, for a young gay man who needs a working nutsack. I don't know. Come on. It would be so cool if you could go down with me. You don't just mean for the weekend, do you, Mas? I'm going to State, Mas. Me and Steve have it all planned out. We can keep living at home and save big bucks this way. I get it, I'm the third wheel. You and Steve have known each other since grade school, et cetera. Come on, Mas, that's not it. All right, but think about how very far away Santa Barbara is from your parents. Mas wants me to try SB. He is primarily concerned with academics, so you should definitely follow his lead. I know he likes to play dumb, but... it's just as good a school as State, isn't it? Let me see, what's the curriculum there? Monday-Wednesday-Friday: sand, Tuesday-Thursday: surf... Lab: Body shots? If I didn't know better, I'd say you're pissed. But you do. OK, you're not pissed. Just quiet and cutting. Sure. Like a ninja. All I'm saying is, it doesn't hurt to consider alternate plans. No, I guess that's a practical thing to do. I just really like the plan we have. How many times are we'll stop to cool the engine before we get to the Southland? I just forgot to top off the radiator before we left. We'll be fine the rest of the way. Quite the performance vehicle. I didn't get this sweet beast for traveling. Just to pull the chicks in. Good job, sport. It's OK, baby. I've got the next best thing. Yeah, yeah. I picked up some entertainment when we stopped for gas. Hey, surprise, Mas bought porn. But this time I got something for you too. What, did I guess wrong? Actually, no. But I'm not going to look at porn with you on the side of the road. That's right, why should you? You've got a live show right here. Mas, dammit, not here. Tib, you know I don't like to get my sexual machinery all backed up. What if somebody sees? Yeah, eek, nudity. Why so shy, Tib? You're among friend here. What's wrong, is the artist's pencil just a stub? Shit, Tib, you're equipped. Don't take it personally. Don't think I could if I wanted to. Don't just sit there, Tib. Grow it or stow it. Fine. But you mind your business, I'll mind mine. Something I can do for you, Mas? What do you see in that instead of this? I don't know. Come on, Tib. You gotta know what gives you a ragin' Cajun. For instance, for me, it's the lift of a woman's breasts. The more erect they are, the more erect I am. I like the fingers. You're a hand man? No, on buff guys, there are these ridges under the pecs, that point down to the abs. Like they don't just have more muscle, but more muscles. A long lean neck turns me on. Like a swan's. I like them thick. A small head on top of a fucking tree stump. Sexy hips. Not just curvy, but flexible. Grinding like clockwork. Small tight ass muscles with the dents in the side. Delicate, smooth, perfect feet. Forearms corded like pistons. Legs a mile long. Shoulders a yard wide. - Huge nipples. - Huge nipples. OK boys, hands off the stick shifts and out of the car. How did you get them to drop the charges, Mr. P? I recognized one of the cops from an orgy back in the day, over in Santa Cruz. I just reminded him what a good time it was... and suddenly he became very interested in getting us out the door as fast as he could. You're so good with people, honeybear. Awesome is what you both are. Come on, Tib, aren't they? Anyway, thanks for springing us. My parents don't need to know about this, right? Or anyone else, for that matter. We'll make it our little secret. That's going to be tough. I don't know about you, Ma, but I have never been prouder of our boy. I was afraid we were raising a priest or something. Don't tempt me. Ooh, a bead shop! Looks like we've got to make a detour. You men coming with or staying? We should get back on the road. Back on the road? OK, safe travels. Maybe no more pit stops, though. Mas, let's just go home. Why? We still need to check out the campus. Not we, you. I'm pretty much done with Santa Barbara. Done? You haven't even seen it yet. But I see where it's going. And this is definitely not the direction I want to go. So, I'm all set for my parents for Historic Carpenter's Imaginary Birthday. Why didn't you get your shopping done? I'll just hit Haight Street on the 24th, pick up some discount yule weed for them. You really need to chill about your parents. They're not bad people. They've always been great to me. They love you. You humor them. Maybe you could try that. Maybe we should invite your lesbian friends over for this. Can't a girt and her groceries get some privacy? How's this for private? Tibby? Hi sweetie. Gentlemen. Just enjoying a little afternoon delight. Nature's way. They had surplus produce at the store, honey. It was just going to go bad. It's wrong to waste food. See Steve, this is why I can't go to State. Shame. I hear they have an outstanding drama program. I heard that. It's nice to see you, Steve. It's nice to see both of you. All of you. I think it's stopped now. That's what you said before the last downpour. It's not like I'm gonna be a meteorology major. Not a problem. There's plenty of fun things to do in a car, right, Tib? Speaking of college, I have some news. I think he wants a drum roll. How's that? I got a scholarship to Berkeley. When did you apply to Berkeley? I applied to lots of places like you're supposed to. Didn't you? As a matter of fact, no. That's great, Tib. That means you can get a scholarship to other, sunnier places. When he says he got a scholarship, he means he accepted a scholarship. Didn't you, Tib? Yeah. I'm going there. To Berkeley. What about your parents? What's to stop Hank and Stormy from packing up and setting up camp in hippie mecca? They can do whatever they want. I'll just be in the dorm. Or the library. Or the art studio. Sounds like you've got it all figured out. Wow, big Tib's moving five miles from home. Eat his dust. Steve, can you crank up the heat on this beater? It's a little fucking frosty in here. No, we're just surprised, man. That's all. It's a good move. Right, Mas? Perfectly logical. You couldn't have programmed it better yourself. I probably could. If I went to Berkeley. Sorry. No problem. I was just in a hurry to blow this joint. Phelps. Thibodeaux, right? Exactly. Well, happy graduation, Thibodeaux Phelps. Yeah, you too. You must be off to the big party. To hell with that. I'm too glad to be rid of these jerks to hang around while they puke up their cherries. I hear you. I don't want to waste my graduation night with people I spent high school avoiding. I'd rather just catch a flick at the Vic or something. What's playing? "Taxi Killer." That's there tonight? I completely forgot. Well, maybe I'll see you there. Whatever. Take it easy, dude. Here you go, courtesy of a really good fake ID. Sorry, I don't drink. What, you're still in high school? I figured this fancy drink might be more your speed. I'll take your word for it. So why weren't you up there giving the big valedictorian speech today? I intentionally got a B in driver's ed to avoid that very fate. I don't think people want to hear advice from an eighteen-year-old. Dude. So you're off to college, I guess. Yeah, Berkeley. How about you? I'm not going to waste money listening to people with no sense of the real world... try to teach me things I don't need to know about anyways. So, no seminary then? Nice one, Thibodeaux. "Thibodeaux." That's a lot to say more than once. Call me "Deaux." Like a deer? Like a female deer. Yeah, like a deer. OK then. Deaux. I think I agree with you about the movie, it didn't really live up to the hype. But that chick was hot. If you say so. I can't really agree. Yeah, I guess not. "Deaux." You trying to tell me that if one of the fine women here walked over... and offered herself up, you wouldn't take her up on It? I'd be flattered, but no. That's unreal. I mean, I'm not calling you a liar or anything... but if you just let her take you in and get you all hard and tingly, that wouldn't feel good? I don't think so. I mean maybe, but it would take her a long time to get me there. If ever. Wrong visual aids. You could close your eyes and make your own visual aids. Maybe you just need to give it a shot. Miss, my friend here was wondering. If I could get a refill on my water, please? Pussy. What about you? If some guy offered a blow-job, no strings, no witnesses, would you turn him down? Um, yes. Even if you closed your eyes? If you were horny, and you had something there to rub you, all warm and wet... why would it matter what gender it was? I don't know. It just would. Maybe you ought to solve that mystery someday. I'm hitting the head. "Sorry, stupid joke... "too much booze for my virgin kidneys. You didn't really think I meant". Don't worry about it. I got it. OK. I guess we're all done then. Are you OK to get home? Didn't even finish the last beer. You've got a way back, I hope. Honestly, I was hoping I could get a ride. On your bike. Sorry, Deaux. Only one helmet. Don't worry, I'll be OK. I don't doubt that. No strings. No witnesses. Morning, son. How's your first morning of adultery? Loud and blurry. Oh, you found the tape. Hmm? No, it's just the news. Brutal wreck on 19th Avenue last night. Some high-school hotshot ran a light and merged his bike right into an SUV. Hope he likes hospital food. Did they say his name? I don't know, Cortland, Torrez, something like that. I don't pay much attention once the weather babe's done. Hey, Sketch Guy. I never see you outside the confines of World History. Emmy. Haven't spotted you in the wild either. Rowwwrrr. So, you have an actual name, right? Thibodeaux. Deaux. That's it. With all the extra letters. Be thankful I use a nickname. So I will. Praised be The Author. The Author? The writer of the book we're all in? We're in a book? Keep up that pithy dialogue, and you won't be in the book much longer. I see. He said, tying. I'm sorry. I really shouldn't do that. It scares people off. It's not the strangest thing I've encountered in my life. That sounds wise and old. And really weird coming out of a face that young and cute. Wow, that's You're really pretty too. OK. At least you didn't say "striking." Sorry, It's just that. Got it. You're speaking with your artist's eye, not your boy parts. That's because my boy parts are reserved for other boy parts. Theoretically, anyway. OK, now you have to be my friend. So, wise one, tell me about the strange things you've encountered in your life. It's just parental crap really. Psychologists? Theater people? Mormons! If only. Shit. Sorry, I didn't realize you were there. Somehow. Not a problem. You're lucky I didn't spill your coffee. That I am. OK then. Enjoy It. You should ask him out. Him? Jarhead biker guy? No way he's gay. Unless he is. Besides, I'm kind of sort of seeing someone. How kind-of-sort-of? A couple times a week. Then you can see him the rest of the week. I don't think so. Wacky hijinks might ensue. Yes, there would be that chance. And Gary's nice. He's English. Oh, spot on! And a Christian. Oh, repressive. No, Gary's the good kind of Christian, who hasn't forgotten the love part. The repressive part is that he works nights. Then you can go to a Halloween party with me. I'm not really that big on parties. But this one's straight-edge. That might be OK. Great. I don't want people t o think we're a couple, 'cause that would keep me from getting clothes. You must promise to go as super gay. Pinky swear. That's a great start. This Emmy sounds like a fun girl. Is she your first hag? That's not nice. Just using the family vernacular. I can't believe gay men's women friends don't complain about that. Right. Someone should make a movie. Speaking of which, I'm off Wednesday night. Do you want to catch "Taxi Killer" at the Parkway? No, once was enough for that movie. Looks like I hit a nerve. No, it's OK. Sometimes you seem to have a lot of nerves. What's that supposed to mean? Nothing. It's just... I really like you, Deaux, and I'd like to see more of you. Do you mean more often, or more naked? I wouldn't object to either one. Won't Jesus object? Jesus doesn't care. He loves us the way we are Jesus may be ready, but I'm not. I'll be careful, I swear. I'll keep that in mind. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to push. You didn't. You're just being honest. I really love your patience. If your parents are half the free spirits you say, I can see why you'd be so freaked out about it. But I'll do right by you, when you say it's time. I know you will. When do I get to meet your parents, by the way? You don't. Man, why did that party suck so hard? Easy. No liquor. Wait, you knew it was a straight-edge party going in. I thought that was a type of music. Besides, alcohol isn't essential to a good time. I've had lots of fun without it, and when I have had it. What? Maybe I shouldn't have. Details? I don't think so. That's OK. The hint of trouble is enough. Your apparent wholesomeness was making me uncomfortable. I'd take that as a compliment if I weren't walking down the street with nothing on but tiny shorts. What are you supposed to be again? I'm an ultimate fighter. And how is that super-gay? Have you seen ultimate fighting? I need to get the bad taste of that party out of my mouth. We should throw a party of our own. I don't think I'm big enough on parties to throw one. Well, by "we" I mean me. We-slash-me will throw a party for the holidays, but earlier than everyone else's. It could be an anti-Christmas party. Lets get coffee and plan. If it's an anti-Christmas party, maybe I could get Steve to come. Fancy meeting you here. Lucky me. Nice outfits. Mine's better, right? Sorry, gotta say, I'm partial to his. You don't say. Your costume's great too. Oh, this isn't a costume. I came here straight from work. Delivering water. Aww. No Halloween festivities for you then? No need. I'm who I want to be all the time. We should go inside. - We should? - Yes. Nice meeting you, hot satisfied guy. Hey you. Feeling festive yet? I'm not really getting the hang of mingling. Just play host. Check on snack and drink supplies, ask people and go from there. Worth a try, I guess. And if you do a good job, maybe next semester you can escape the dorm and move in here. Seriously? Unless you and Gary are moving that direction. Hardly. OK then, start earning your keep. Steve? Tib. Awesome party, man. This is different. You switch to contacts? Better. Lasers. And the buzz-cut? I got tired of that mess of hair and realized the answer was simple. Slight risk of having a freakish skull underneath, but it turned out OK. I'll say. Its hot as hell. Sorry. But it's true. Let me pour you a beer. I know it's all a big change. But honestly, I'm proud of myself. You should be. And I promise I'm not going to go all Mas on you and try to get you worked up without a payoff. Meaning there will be a payoff? I haven't changed that much, Tib. Wait, there's someone I want you to meet. You want to stick around here and I'll go get her? Yeah, I'll be out here somewhere. Deaux, look who's here. Sorry I never introduced myself before. Todd Ash. Todd. Welcome. I was just telling Emmy what a cool house this is. Just exploiting my software millionaire parents. Two houses, one here, one in San Jose. And because they've sold their souls, they live in the San Jose one. It's luck your parents made. They probably decided to live in San Jose so you could be here. How's your luck? Good. Always. I hope so, what with the motorcycle. Motorcycles aren't really dangerous. You just have to ramp up your awareness level because everyone else is dangerous. You should let me take you for a ride sometime. I don't think so. I'm sure I'd be in good hands, but... my family has a bad history with motorcycles. Todd, excuse me. Emmy, there's someone outside I want you to meet. Sure. Todd, make sure you try the mango gingerbread cookies. Deaux made them. Really? No. Slow down, cowboy. You invited that guy? Why not? The more the merrier. Is that a problem? Deaux, really, take it easy. I can't run in these feet. Steve! Hey Tib, have you met... Steve, this is Emmy, our lovely hostess and my co-conspirator at Berkeley. Emmy, this is my lifelong heterosexual friend Steve. I've heard tons. Not just the heterosexual part. Great to meet you Emmy. "Deaux"? You're not the only one who gets to try something new. Steve was kind of my high-school spirit guide. What kind of animal were you, Steve? Coyote? Panther? Box turtle! Hard to say. I don't really know much about animals until they're in meat form. This is incredible. My two best friends meeting. Seems like, I don't know, meant to be. I'll catch you later, Tib Deaux. There's someone I really need to talk to. Emmy, really great to meet you. Nice party. I'm not sensing much of a Native American vibe there. Oh well. So Huxley seems to be decrying a blissful "Matrix" -like ignorance... but what if the book is just foreshadowing his later LSD use... and suggesting that tripping out is a rational response to dystopia? Except the point of tripping out is that it's irrational. Right, Deaux? You're talking over my head. I really don't do drugs. Or books. That's what college is for, right? I thought it was for keggers and pretentiousness. There's room for all of it if you're a cagey scheduler. I wanted to take a course on time management, but I couldn't fit it in. Pretty smooth. Thanks. What else can you do with that tongue? Deaux! Gary, you made it. Glad to see you too. It's so good that you're here. Definitely good. I hope you had a good time. The best. Thanks a lot, buddy. Thanks for coming. It was a good party. Great place. Thanks. Not mine, but thanks. The bike looks great. It is. Looks great, rides great. You would be in good hands, Deaux. Very good hands. There's my AWOL co-host. Thank the Author you have a worthy substitute. Emmy tells me you're moving in here. That's exciting. I guess so. Too much going on tonight to think about it. Sounds like a fun party. Sorry I missed most of it. Who says you did? What are you saying, Deaux? Maybe we should spend the night at your place. Really? Are you sure? How much beer have you had? Only one beer, officer. As long as it's what you really want. It is. Are you all right? I'm fine. You're not even hard. I'm just nervous. Don't worry. This is good. You're good. You're so beautiful. This is so special. I'm sorry. No rough stuff, Deaux. I'm just clumsy, that's all. Please, keep going. Where to? Just drop it anywhere. Emmy's spending Christmas with her parents, so I can unpack at my leisure. This is a really cushy deal, Deaux. Such a great place. I guess it helped you land that hot chick, huh? At the party? No, nothing really happened there. She found out my parents weren't especially rich and decided she couldn't date "down." Oh. Sorry. Don't be. I was too locked-in on that for my own good. It's like, I don't know, I got to college... and figured out this transformation, and I realized I had shots. So I started taking them. As well you should. I should probably be more casual about it. You know, I was kind of hoping you and Emmy would hit it off. So that's what you've been trying not to bring up all break. I'm just surprised you didn't even notice her. I noticed her, Deaux. She's really something. But she's your friend. I don't want to make things weird. Let's just take it easy and let the random universe work its magic, OK? Makes sense. Sure. I noticed a lot at the party. Like you and Gary. And you and that rugged guy. If you think you noticed anything, you might want to get your eyes un-lasered. Want to hear some cool historical science? Who doesn't? So there's this hypothesis that, back in primitive times... the two halves of people's brains weren't completely hooked up. So one half the brain would react to something... and the other half wouldn't realize It was the same brain. They thought it was the voice of God. Or a god. Is that why everyone in Roman and Bible times thinks some god is telling them crazy shit? Right. They couldn't question it because the brain couldn't process complex ideas yet. They thought they were being commanded from on high... when maybe the real answer was being drowned out because they didn't know how to listen to themselves. Huh. That's... Pertinent? Holy fuck. It's going to be a gorgeous day. I'm riding up to Mount Tam. You should come with me, Deaux. I'm not really dressed for it. This should take care of you. I told you. I'm not really the motorcycle type. That's just because you haven't had a good experience with a trustworthy guide. Maybe. But... a ride isn't really something I need. But is it something you want? That was incredible. Always is. More so this time. It gets better. This is so damn wonderful. Yeah, you said that. Does this ruin the moment, or make it better? What if someone sees? No one will. Are you sure? Have you ever known me not to be? Then better. Keep 'em on. Yes sir. You OK? I went way past OK hours ago. Nice digraph. It's the letter ash, like my last name. Our language would be less of a mess if we'd just kept some of the Old English letters... ash, edh... thorn. Tell me more. Later. Fuck. Now. You don't think I can talk and fuck at the same time? You can do anything you want. Did you know the World Tree in Norse mythology was an ash? Odin hung himself on it for nine days, pierced by a spear. I'd like to be pierced by your spear for nine days. Look who's got a one-track mind. You OK, Deaux? It seemed like you were having a good time last night. I'm afraid I was. Are you really interested in Old English? Any language is interesting to me. Religion too. Trying to work out how people think, why they believe the things they do. Emmy could be a thesis for you. Sounds like you ought to be a teacher. You said it. But as a career? No. I'm too fond of spending and receiving money. And the water job's good for that? Good enough for now, while I finish school, make some plans. Beats restaurant work. I'm not a good waiter. This is your work, isn't it? They're just sketches. They're good. They should be somewhere people can see them. Thanks. I like the strong lines. Heroic. Mythology would really lend Itself to your style. Lots of larger-than life subjects there. I notice you always work on the horizontal. But no time for the esoteric. People in offices will have nothing to speak useless crap around unless I get there first. I guess not. Maybe tonight we could get some Indian food, watch a movie... try some things at my place. I love Indian food. Weird, it's like you knew that. Educated guess. Not tonight. I need to take things a little slower, Todd. If you say so. You should know what you need. Want. When you're ready, you know where to find me. But like I said, I'm not a good waiter. Looks like your folks did OK by you this Christmas. This is why I keep them. Can't wait to use it at New Year's. Say something brilliant. Yeah, you can see the creativity pouring right out of me. Just pretend you're on reality TV. I am a skanky ho after all. I don't get what you're being so emo about. Can't you just divert your self-hatred into your art like normal people? I thought so, but every sketch I start heads directly into muscle-porn territory. You just need a fresh topic. What's this? I bumped into this New Agey friend over Christmas. She lives two blocks away in this party pit, but I see her in San Jose. C'est l'auteur. Anyway, she's starting this local woo-woo mag... and now that I remember, she said something about needing an illustrator. I didn't mention it before because there's no money in it, and I forgot... but maybe if you start thinking about this... you'll stop overthinking your feelings about this Todd guy, and then you... Steve. I thought you were drowning in the website business. I am. That's why I called. Could I ask you a favor? I'm bound to owe you one. I've got a gig for a gay gamers' site. You want me to model? No, I want you to draw. Ahem. I thought we should wrestle. I assumed this was just a costume. I've got some moves. What are the stakes? If I win, you go with me to a New Year's party tonight... and at the stroke of midnight we head back to your place and do it till dawn. That's if I lose? What if I win? Name it. If I win, you promise not to chicken-shit out on me again like you did the other morning... and we spend New Year's at the last place you'd want to go. You think you know where that is? Doesn't matter. You'll tell me when I pin you. Lets dance, bitch. Wait, they arrested them on the side of the road? For doing what? You dog. I can just see them there, Mas with his girly mag, Tibby with his boy-y mag. Such a cute picture. Is this the part where you don't tell anyone? Todd isn't just anyone, sweetie. That much is dear. Another beer, Todd? Absolutely. It's nothing to be ashamed of, Deaux. "Deaux." Yeah, I like that. Quick. Strong. Like "Hank." I get the feeling he takes after you. At least I hope so. I'm Emmy and this is our home-made commentary track for our super summer hot-tub party. Carry me over the threshold, sweetie. You're too light, pumpkin. You might float away. Don't worry. Your bullshit will anchor me. Joining me is Thibodeaux Phelps. Greetings, imaginary audience. I still can't believe we got this house. You mean you can't believe Todd got the house. There's the super-hunk now. Yum. And there's my old friend, Steve. So the website said the house was booked for the weekend... but Todd gave them a call, and boom, available. And cheap. What's up with that, Deaux? Emmy, did you see? This is the first of many master works in our local news rag... by future world-renowned illustrator Thibodeaux Phelps. Do you think he'll remember us when he's famous? We could be his entourage. Deaux? Can we be your entourage? Sure. You can start by getting me a fresh cock. Wait, there's one right here. Deaux, it's not a commentary if you don't comment. (Thibodeauxj I don't know what I'm supposed to- - Our surprise special guest star. - I'm here. You can start fun now. Stop rolling your eyes, Deaux. No one can see you. My name is Tomas. But you can just ask for "Mas." Ladies. Or "no mas," as the case may be. That's better. OK, for those new to the story, Mas came back this summer from Santa Barbara... saying he's quit school because he's quote "tired of partying" unquote. Good thing, 'cause here's the party. Hey, a little privacy. Calm down, there's something even more sex-tastic over... here. Can't argue with that. I didn't know you shot this. Ah-ha. No fair, I was out in the open and you were, what, behind the couch? Shhh. Let's just listen. We're in a book, not just me. And movies are too contrived. So give me some evidence that we're in a book. Your luck, for starters. That's no proof. Luck is real, and it's not magical. It's expecting and accepting the happenstance of reality with honesty and confidence. - Nice camerawork, though. - Thanks. Says Mr. Atheist. Don't call me that. That's a religion. I thought by definition it isn't. To me, religion is any set of beliefs about the universe... that is forced down other people's throats. Amen. And whatever I think about how the universe works... I would never try to get you to give up your Author, Emmy. Your outlook is true faith, with no moral judgments. And that's a rare and beautiful thing in this world. These drinks are tasty. Whoa, hello nighttime. I really loved this hot tub. Yeah, who expected you to be such a hot-tub lover? It's so Stormy and- It's just a tub thing. Besides, who's calling who a hot-tub lover? Anything you want to say about what this led to, Emmy? A lady doesn't boff and tell. Really, no comment? How can this be a commentary if you don't comment? What's to say? He's a lean slice of sex on a stick. Who'd say no to that? I just wish I'd warned you that Mas always says no eventually. It wasn't a problem, Deaux. We had a summer full of yesses. Hot, sweaty yesses. I wasn't really looking for a long-term contract. But see, that's something else you and Mas have in common. Did you stop to think that since you both think that way... then maybe you're actually made for each other? You're taking logic this semester, right? I have never taken it up the ass. Ooh, randy. I don't mean to go on about you and Mas. I just want you to find what Todd and I have. Yeah, you and Todd, the ultimate duo. At least. - At least ultimate, which makes no sense Or at least a duo? - Mr. Phelps, are you looking to expand? - No, just a stupid attempt at a joke. It might be fun to add a little extra spice to the regular diet. I don't think so. I bet Todd would go for it. He seems like a man of the world. Unlike yourself. I don't know. We've never talked about it. Oh, sad, end of the party. - For some of us. - For your dreams, Steve. Oh God. Nightmares. This was such a great time. Why don't we do this every night again? Because we have career goals, and limited income... and livers we like to keep functioning. Right. I know I make it look naughty... but I'm just following him out to help him take the lid off the tub. Which took you three hours. Were you waiting up, Mom? - No. Just basking in the afterglow. Again. - Keeping the sixes. Aww. - How unprofessional. - Why am I not surprised? Sorry. Hey, baby. I was just talking about you. Why, what happened? Your Uncle Roger sounded great. I wish I could have met him. He was the only one in the family who didn't act like me being gay was just me being stubborn. The only one who'd talk about it, really. It's weird that he died. I guess I just thought you were immune from that sort of thing. I'm not a wizard, Deaux. But Uncle Roger was no slouch in the make-your-own-luck department. The doctors told him the cancer was going to kill him fifteen years ago. I should go with you. I thought about asking you. But that might trigger family drama, and I don't want that detracting from honoring Uncle Roger. Besides, you have that deadline for the paper. I'm sorry I have to bail on our Halloween plans, though. You didn't really want to go anyway. No, but I was going to. I know. Why is that? When we started out, I felt like you needed me to guide you... to help you be OK with what you wanted. Since then you've surprised me. You try things, Deaux. I love that. I love you. What the? Our costumes for Halloween. You and me, Tib, at a rocking party at this sweet pad up in the hills. Football? What position am I supposed to play, benchwarmer? Wingman. There's a really hot lady at this party that I've got to score with. Get it, "score"? I've got this whole theme going here. Sorry, Mas. I promised Emmy I'd join her in a Halloween boycott this year... since Todd's gone and we had a weak experience last year. You should go, Deaux. I might have plans after all. Do tell. I got a text message from Steve inviting me to go to a party with him. See, Emmy always lands on her feet. Trust me. Come on, Tib, are you in? What the hell. Kick ass. Now, on to burritos. That sounds like Steve's number. I'm just calling to tell him I hate text messages. Here you go, Mrs. P. Please, it's Donna. You are so adorable. What's this you've brought me? Well, I noticed your drink was running low, so. So you brought me some farmer swill. That's what I get for leaving the bartending to amateurs. Go... go. Loser. It's up to Mas to show him how to reel in the big fish. She's your target? I thought you were looking for sex, not a ride to soccer practice. Sometimes a guy just wants to set his sights a little higher, my man. Here. When I hook up, I don't want to wreck the mood looking for you... so Just take the car home and I'll pick it up tomorrow. I don't have any pockets. Where the hell do football players put things? It's not like you need your wallet out on the field. If you wanted pockets, you should have come as an accountant. As if accountants come. You've gotten smutty in your old age, Tib. About time. Oh wait, we're football players. It's bad form to masturbate at a party, Tib. Cars OK, parties no. Got it. What are you doing back? Did the lady of the house run off to a PTA meeting? If that's your way of asking if your friend struck out, then, yes. Hey. Sorry. First time for everything. So we can go home now? It's still a party, Tib. Let's play it up. Let's get into character. Man, that was one awesome victory! I'm glad all y'all fans came out, 'cause it's all for you. Even though we're taking home the trophy and the giant paycheck. Good one. Try the accent. And I thank the Lord for smiling down on us, as we knew He would... because the other team is less deserving of victory for some reason. Probably kitten-eaters or something. Woo! You got that right, my Cajun QB. Most valuable player right here, folks. Why don't we go down on the field and see if they've mopped up all the blood yet? Forget that, buddy. I've got a little surprise for you, MVP. You were the hero today, Phelps, and you deserve a hero's reward. We've got no audience now, Mas. You can put away the redneck. What are we doing here? You and me, we're a great team. Always have been. That's enough, Mas. I appreciate you keeping tonight's game of tease-the-homosexual away from the crowd... but let's get inside. What's the matter, Phelps? Step up, stud. Time to claim your prize. Maybe I will. You don't want to get into a game of gay chicken with me, Mas. You don't know what I won't do anymore. That's what I'm counting on, Tib. What do you want exactly? You're the quarterback. And I'm the receiver. And you are clearly ready to play. Have you done this before? No. You're my first cock, Tib. As it should be. It might hurt. Now you're challenging my manhood. I don't have a condom. Quit worrying and fuck me, Tib. Maybe I should try a finger first. Just go for it, Tib. Please. You OK? Bring it on, champ. Ohhh. Damn. Yeah? Yeah. Yeah. - What was that? - Shit. Who's here? Doesn't matter. I got enough. Donna, what's with the camera? Pretty, not bright. Just like I like 'em. Nobody said anything about a camera. - Mas, what the hell's going on? - It'll be fine, I'll just. Mas! She wanted to see us fuck, and I wanted to fuck her. I'll get her to erase It. Everything will be OK. Donna! We had a deal. The camera wasn't part of the deal. Whatever the two of you worked out, nobody fucking consulted me. Erase the file now. Honey, if I'm not sitting in my hair stylist's chair... I'm not taking orders from a homosexual. Hey everybody, want to see what really goes on in the locker room? Yeah! Hey. Tib, I... I should have known. I guess if I had been more of a pervert you would have bothered to call me. Gary, I'm sorry, I. Here I was being careful, but I was way off the mark on you. I guess all the talk about your parents should have been a red flag. Looks like the asshole doesn't fall far from the tree. Oh, Anime Girl, I have you now. Deaux, what's wrong? You too, Steve? Me too what? What happened? This happened. This fucking selfish fucking hippie bullshit happened. Deaux, I don't understand. It doesn't matter. I do. Deaux, please. What's going on? You know you can tell me anything. Thibodeaux! I have good news. I doubt that. I got Donna to erase the file. I watched her do it. There's no copies. It won't be turning up anywhere. The costume's in the car. I'm so sorry, Tib. Just go. Does Todd know about this? Funny, when we started, when you got me so worked up I was too stupid to turn back... I was all set to tell him afterwards. Thought it was the kind of adventure he'd approve of. Then tell him. He loves you. He'll understand. He'll understand? I don't understand. No wait, I do, but. I never thought you hated me so much, Tomas. God, no. Never did, even though you've treated me like a fucking toy. And I let you, because you're hot, and you pretended to be my friend. Tib, I'm sorry. I. You fucking asshole. You goddamned fucking son-of-a-bitch. Tib, I swear, I've always tried to be your friend. I just. I don't deserve you. As a friend, as anything. I'm so fucking sorry for what I've done, I swear, I'll do anything to make it up to you. Then get the hell out of my life. Tib, there's something you need to know. What? I liked it, Tib. I really liked It. Better than I imagined. That's fucking fantastic. I'm glad using me worked out for you. I mainly liked that it was you. That woman was just an excuse, Tib. I loved that it was you. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have let it happen. It's OK, Deaux. No, it's not. Then it can be. No harm was done. No harm was done? Mas betrayed me. I betrayed you. "Betrayed" is too strong. You were both a little self-focused, but you didn't want to hurt anyone. But we did. Who did you hurt? I'm still here. You wore a condom, right? Yeah. Then there's no reason to worry about it anymore. It doesn't have to change anything. Dammit, Mas humiliated me. You have to get over that. A bunch of jerks you don't know at a bad party. Who cares what they thought? You weren't there. It was awful. Is that why you're telling me? No, I'm telling you because you deserve to know. But now I'm wondering... if you would have mentioned this if it hadn't turned out the way it did. Of course I would. OK. I believe you. Which is why you brought it up. Are you saying I'm tying? No. I'm just saying maybe we're not such a good idea. I'm sorry, Deaux. You told me. That's what matters. You think this is funny. Yes, a little. It's not like you'd really leave me. Watch me. Deaux, come on. Deaux, please don't do this. Goddammit, why are you doing this? Guess there's no point getting a new-year calendar yet. Might as well wait and get one to match my new decor. They'll be on sale, too. So how's it going? It's sucking. You found a place to live yet? Since they're selling my home out from under me... my parents owe me free lodging until I find someone to share a place. Someone else, I mean. San Jose is a hell of a commute. Worse than mine. I know someone who can help you stay close by. That sounds like your get-back-together-with-Todd tone. Huh. I didn't know I had tones. You haven't talked to him, have you? No, Deaux. Your requested shunning of him has remained in full force. Sorry I brought him up. I'm sorry too. It's just, the whole no-home-no-money thing is weighing on me. Still no bites on illustration work? The paper won't take my calls since I stiffed them at Halloween. And no one else is buying. It's going to be OK, Deaux. I'm just counting the Author's blessings that I've got a place to fall back to. But mine's not a place to fall back to. It's a place I never escaped. Well, I don't remember you having this much stuff when you moved out. Yeah, I think there's a whole extra box. I would have made sure to accumulate more if I'd known I was coming back to an empty room. I am sorry about the bed, Tibby. But I just thought you'd left the nest, and I needed a yoga room. That couch is plenty comfy. And not just for sleeping. Your mother and I have done plenty of naked gymnastics on that baby. Shit Dad, how do you not understand that not only do I not want to know details like that but you're not supposed to share them with me? Says who? Say, where are these rules you're always quoting? They're basic parenting rules. Everyone else seems to know them. Rules are for cowards. And what have we done as parents that's so horribly wrong? Calm down, Hanky. He's just upset because his dharma wheel's on the down side. But there's always an up side, even if you have to give it a little push. Do you even know what a dharma wheel is? Obviously, honey. Yin and yang. The oneness of the universe. Good deeds come back to you. That's karma, not dharma. And don't give me that good deed crap, because I don't deserve to end up here. I know it's not what you planned, Tibby. But it's so good to have you home. No, it's not at all what I planned. And just so we're all clear, I'm not happy to be back, OK? What would make you happy, son? It's not about being happy, Dad. Maybe it's about making something out of your life. Goddess forbid you do both. That's OK, Emmy. I'm not crippled. So the sprain's all better then? I didn't say that. Especially after the hike over here. You know, our old hangout's a lot closer to campus. There's no way that's happening. Sorry. So, I have news. I found a roommate. Anyone I know? It's Steve. We found a place near campus. Whose campus, his or yours? Ours. He's going to try to transfer for the fall. Great. Gang's all here. Does this mean you're a full-fledged couple now? I don't know if I can force those words out of my mouth exactly. But I did decide that it was time I took the risk of sticking with something good. What led you to that conclusion? Deaux, back when my parents decided to sell the house, they asked me first if it was OK. I said it was. Why? Were you already planning on living with Steve? No, Deaux. I just knew I didn't want to live with you anymore. And you've been sitting on this all semester? Deaux, it's one thing to just wallow, to act like joy is poison. But you asked me to help you hurt others. I should have said no then, but I didn't. I am now. You've talked to Todd. Yes. No state secrets or anything. Just having the decency to acknowledge his existence. Mas, too. Unbelievable. Fucking unbelievable. I'm sorry, Deaux. But I'm not. I'm just surprised you didn't take care of this online. I'm going to be pushing it to squeak into the transfer window... so I figured some face time might make a difference. Makes sense. So how's the leg? OK, I guess. So you're back on your board. Hell no. I swore off skateboards. Of course. You implying something, Steve? Not if you're not inferring. Why don't you just speak your mind? Everyone else does. When they get around to it. I don't think I will, Deaux. I'm pretty sure there's nothing I can say that won't make things worse, right? Then I won't take up any more of your time. There's the admin building. I'll give you a life that will be happiness. All you need to do is follow what I say. I wonder what the noise is all about? It is the life of the righteous. You will understand what I'm saying. Everyone will listen. You all need to listen. The Lord is watching. What are you doing at Berkeley, preacher man? Are you lost? I was lost once, and I allowed myself to be seduced... by the empty desires of those who refuse the path of the Lord. I was pulled into the empty maw of sexual desire. Did she spit or swallow? Then the Lord showed me what a sinner I had been. He struck me down, but then He picked me up, and He showed me the light. And now, in His infinite mercy... He allows the very sinner who tempted me to regain his life. My friend, have you turned aside from your godless ways? I haven't. You want to make something of it? Friend, your ways are the kind God can abide least of all. And if you do not repent, you will pay for your lust... like the sorry souls of Sodom before you. Leave me alone. Let me help you now. It is not too late. Repent, Thibodeaux Phelps. Cortez, you lucking coward. You are the coward, Thibodeaux, the one too afraid... to give up his lustful pleasures for the sake of a righteous life. You're so wrong. About me, about everything. The truth is written. You're even wrong about yourself. I bet you if I offered you another secret bathroom blow-job... your cock would be in my mouth so fast your balls would break my teeth. Stop! Sproul Plaza.

I hope you're seeing this. They're gradually unplugging me from things here. Bummer. I was looking forward to being a cyborg. Though on the other hand, it would be nice to walk on my own legs. They tell me if the surgery works out, I just may have a shot at that. Everyone's been really encouraging. Mas has been by a few times. He told me some stuff, Deaux. Don't blame him. I used my newly found powers of being paralyzed to pity it out of him. Cortez came by too, with some half-assed apology. I don't know what happened there, Tib. Deaux. I'm surprised how much I don't know from you. But I do know what you're thinking. And this is not your fault. It just happened. They tell me most people with catastrophic trauma... just torture themselves trying to figure out a reason for it. I can't do that. The universe is random. So there's no point in wasting energy on "why me." But it doesn't mean that things can't be better. It would be great, for example... if my best friend came to see me. Out of the tub, pruney. Someone here to see you. I don't want to see anyone. Go on in. We'll go hit happy hour somewhere and give you some space. What are you doing here? Your father called me. My dad has your number? No, but your phone still does, as luck would have it. He had no right. You shouldn't be here. Because you say so. What about me? Get out. I need to get dressed. You've got to be kidding. It's not funny. I said get out. No. We're going to talk about this. You owe me that much. Fine. I'll get dressed somewhere else. You're a piece of work sometimes, Deaux. You try to hide your modesty from someone who's been inside you. You'd try to hide behind glass in a sunlit room. What's that, Old English poetry? That's right, play the prick. So everyone will leave you alone, and you can live in that safe, simple, sexless world you think you want. You know what I want? I want you to stop telling me what I want. Then you tell me. No. Because what we want can't be all that matters. If we all just give into our cravings, we'll all just destroy each other... tear apart the fucking world for our own gratification. Not everything we want has to hurt people. You want to be an artist. Who does that hurt, Deaux? What hurts people is when we strain so hard to bury something we want, something reasonable... we make false connections, strange rules we expect everyone else to live by. Just let it go, Todd. Let me go. No. I never should have done that. So I'll tell you what I want. I want to tell you how goddamned angry I am that you shut me out. - If you just hadn't - Let me fucking finish! I want you to know how much I've missed you, ached for you, this whole time. I want you back, Deaux. And I want to fuck you. Right now. You can't really believe I would want to do that. Then why haven't you put your pants on yet? Even if you don't say yes to that, I'm not leaving until you're at least honest with me. I know I'm right. I know you wanted everything we've ever done. But I don't want to want it. Why the hell not? Because of what I become. What I let happen. Deaux! The messed-up things you see with those beautiful eyes. Do you trust me? Does this feel right? Everyone's always ready for sex except me. That's because everyone else can admit they want it. Now, does this feel right? It always did. But. Sex isn't bad, Deaux. We're not passing diseases around or making unwanted babies... and you know I'm not going to force you into anything. What we do is up to you. We're exactly what you want us to be, responsible adults. So long as you're being honest, where's the hurt? Where's the wrong? It's not wrong, it's just. What? Too good. Just be honest, Deaux. Part of you already is. What does the rest of you say? Damn, I've missed you. Me or this? Both. So, you love sex with me. And you love it with other men, too. I loved it with Mas. Until I knew he was tying. And because it was about sex, you couldn't forgive him. You understand. No. Not at all. So. Can you forgive Mas? Can you forgive me? I'm doing it right now. Can I forgive Mas this way? Maybe. I may want to forgive him too. That would be. Fantastic. Did you do anything wrong with Cortez? Todd, no, not now. Answer me. No, but he crashed because of me. Because of sex with you? I guess I'm not getting home tonight. But you. You thought my luck was saving me, and that made it OK. I know that doesn't I just never. God, I'm a mess. I'm sorry. Stop being sorry, Deaux. Just own... up... to what... you fucking... want. Get in the beanbag. What do you mean? I mean, sit your ass down, Ash. I'm riding a man's cock in my parents' living room. Yes you are. And it's OK, isn't it? Hell no, it is not OK. Hell no yeah. It's amazing. Deaux? I know it's far too late, but... I can try to explain myself if you want to hear it. Do you believe in Jesus, Deaux? Not that way. I think he said some good things, maybe even did some outstanding stuff. But he's not our savior? No. But I can't blame anyone for wanting a savior. Do you believe in God? Or Goddess? No. Too catch-all. Too convenient. Satan? Too phony. The Author? Makes as much sense as anything else. What about the random universe? Band name. You really should believe in something, Deaux. I believe in you. Something bigger than me. I couldn't take anyone bigger than you. You're one to talk. But seriously. Yes, sir. Hi, my name's Thibodeaux, and I acknowledge the existence of a lower power. That's my Tibby. Amen. Give me that hot-tub religion. That's it. That's what I believe in. That's my boy. That's the answer, you know. Find peace, clear the mind, and you can touch the universe. And take anything it throws at you. Draw eight. You can't make me draw. I'm crippled. Boo-hoo. You nearly walked across the living room just this morning. Mas, your ex-girlfriend is being mean to me. I'm on it. Draw twelve. You can't play that. It's red. I know you have red, so you can't play that. It's a rule. Rules are for suckers. I always liked his attitude. Hey, you guys mind if I join you? If you bring me a drink. Any time, my man. You guys want anything?
