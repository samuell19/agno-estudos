Sorry, Dad. I didn't hear you come in. You seemed a million miles away just now. Oh, not quite that far. I was just thinking about sailing over to Whidbey Island this weekend. Again? Well, I don't have enough time to sail to Fiji or Bora Bora. - It's my own fault, I guess. I shouldn't have taken you sailing before you could walk. Oh, well, then, who would've been your first mate? [Both chuckling] By the way, did you get a chance to go over the Cahill case? I glanced at it, but... I don't know, Dad. It's a-- It's a really big case. Exactly. You just won your last client a $12-million settlement, so everybody wants you. But I'm exhausted. I was on that case for two and a half years. I'd like to take a break. Fine. Take a couple of weeks. [Scoffs] A couple of weeks? I mean, that's barely long enough to sail to San Diego and back. Well, maybe after you win the Cahill case, you can take more time off. Can I get that in writing? - Not a chance. [Chuckling] [sighs] [background music plays] Where's my penne? Is it al dente? Order up! This is gluten-free. Go. Jake? Yeah? Why is bouillabaisse listed as tonight's special? Because bouillabaisse is tonight's special. It's Friday. The menu is always sole almandine. And that's exactly why I did it. I mean, come on, we haven't changed the menu in, like, what? Five years I've been here? Yeah, and I don't intend to start now. Why? If you go out there, every one of our customers is loving that bouillabaisse. - My customers. - Oh, okay. Yeah, they come here knowing they can rely on good food and a menu that they are familiar with. You know what? That's not what fine dining is all about. What's wrong with trying something new? - Well, you're free to do that. - Oh? Just not here. Order up! Order up. Let's go. Hot bouillabaisse. Go, go, go. [Sighs tensely] [♪♪] Um, glass of red wine. Something that pairs nicely with frustration. Sounds like you're having a bad night. Hey, Bennett! I didn't see you sitting there, buddy. How are you? Maybe that's because you're only seeing red at the moment. Ah, no, not quite red, but I'm sure this will help. [Clink] Good to see you. Where you been? I haven't seen you in a while. I just got back from cruising the Greek Islands. That's-- must be nice. It was, and so's this bouillabaisse. Actually, it's excellent. Well, enjoy it while you can, 'cause it's not gonna be on the menu... ever again. That's too bad. Yeah. Couldn't agree more. I try something new here all the time, and what happens to me is I get shot down. Mm. And you know something else? I almost quit tonight. Would you? Would I what? Quit. Because I know some people who are looking for a chef. - Really? - Mm-hmm. [Phone rings] Yes? Tia, your Uncle Roland's on line three. Oh, great. Put him on. [Line beeps] Hi, Uncle Roland. Hey. Hope I'm not disturbing you. I know how busy you can be. Never too busy for you. How's Aunt Julie? We're both great. Have you finished the renovations to the boat yet? No, not yet. Julie and I are hoping to be up and running by the beginning of the summer. Oh, wow! That's right around the corner. Yes, well, that is why I'm calling you. We have a legal issue regarding a dock lease, and Julie and I were hoping maybe you could take a look at the paperwork? Of course. I would be happy to, but why are you asking me and not Dad? Because he still thinks turning an old yacht into a floating restaurant is a bad idea. [Laughs] Well, I don't happen to agree with him. Have you hired the rest of the crew yet? Yes... well, everyone but the chef, but we have a lead on someone we're meeting with tonight. How about I email you the lease this afternoon? You know, I have a better idea. I've been wanting to take some time off, and I'm dying to see the boat, so what about if I fly down there for the weekend? Fantastic. Great. [♪♪] Mm... This cassoulet is exquisite. I agree. Thank you. The job is yours, if you want it. Really? Just like that? [Laughs] Well, hardly "just like that." After sampling all these dishes, each one better than the next? You more than convinced us. I do suppose I got a little carried away, but the kitchen here is exceptional, and the owner was extremely generous to let me use it, so thank you. After 30 years of managing this place for him, he and I are very good friends, so it wasn't a problem. In fact, he's been very supportive of our new restaurant. I'm leaving with his blessing. You know what else is exceptional? This coq au vin. - It is an old family recipe. My mother's French. Ah, well, it should definitely be on the menu. - Mm-hmm. Oh, but, you would be the executive chef, so it would be your decision. So you're telling me I have the freedom to create my own menu? Well, of course. It would be your kitchen. You have no idea how long I've waited to hear that. Thank you. So... we have a chef? Certainement. [Laughing] [Roland] We got a great slip right in front, just behind the breakwater. Beautiful. I'm so excited and proud of you guys. This is such a huge deal. She's magnificent. We think so, too. Do you mind if I take a look? - No, please. Go, explore. - Of course. Okay. I think she likes it. I think so, too. [♪♪] So... what do you think? She's spectacular. - Yay! - We figure, with the seating on the upper deck, we can accommodate at least 30 diners on every cruise. It's getting really exciting... and a little bit scary, now that it's all coming together. Yeah, well, it's a big change in your lives... but a good one. Not to mention a big risk at our ages. Ah, what's the fun in life if you don't take a risk now and again? That's right, and to be honest, I-I really envy you guys. Really? See if you feel that way after we open. We should go. We got to see the attorney. Right. Okay. I'll see you back at the house. - Mwah. - Okay, good luck. Bye. If you're interested, there's a farmer's market, and there's a great little taco shack right there. - Oh, that sounds good. Maybe... Oh! Oh, uh... I think Julie has the keys. - Oh. - I'll catch up. Okay. Do you need help? Um, okay... You know, I think if you just put a little more tension on it, it would-- Hey, watch out for the kite! Oof! Are you okay? [Chuckles] I'm fine, just a turtle kite... - Tia? - Jake Jarett. Wow, I guess you haven't forgotten my name, huh? You're pretty hard to forget. Thank you. It wasn't a compliment. Tia, come on, 12 years is a long time to hold a grudge. No, it's not a grudge. I just... You're a face from my past I didn't expect to see again. I never thought I'd see you either, but is this how you always react when you run into your ex-boyfriends? Just the ones who broke my heart. Yeah. You hold the record for that, so... Uh... I got over it, though, so. Guess I do deserve that. And more, but... Like I said, I'm over it. I know. I-I heard that the first time, so... Nice to see you, though. Eventful, at any rate. - Okay! - Yeah. Watch out for kites. - Okay. [♪♪] [Julie] How did it go with the attorney? Well... because the boat was an inheritance, he agreed to grandfather-in the original dock lease, so the terms will remain the same. That's great news! Oh, thank you so much, Tia. You're welcome. I'm just happy I could do something to help, even if it was something small. Well, are you ready to help some more? Of course! What do you need? Your honest opinion. I want you to taste them and tell me which ones we should put on the menu. Why not all of them? These look amazing. Uncle Roland, what do you think? Oh, I love everything Julie bakes, and to prove it, I've gained five pounds the last few weeks. - That's not true. - [Phone buzzing] Oh, excuse me. Uh, ahem. Hello? What are these again? They are madeleines. I use the cardamom spice to sort of balance out the citrus-- That's okay. Julie, these are incredible. Ahem. That was Jeremy. Oh, he's our captain. Was our captain. What? - Yeah, he just quit. - No! He got a better offer from a big cruise line. Well, that certainly leaves us in a bind. [♪♪] [Julie] Oh, hey. You're up early. Yeah, I couldn't sleep. Just... had a lot on my mind. Ah. I'm a good listener... Okay. So remember yesterday when I said I envied you and Roland? Mm-hmm. Well, it's more than that. I... I really admire what you guys are doing. Gambling our life savings? Okay, maybe not that part, but you're doing something you're both excited about. I want in on that. Do you mean you want to be an investor? In a way. Would you consider letting me be captain of the Yellowfin? Honey! I've spent the last two and a half years on a really tough case, and I need to take time off, so what I'm proposing is that I be your captain for the summer. I mean, you both know how much I love the sea, and I've had my captain's license since I've been 24, so I'm fully capable of sailing anything from a small dinghy to a hundred-foot trawler yacht. We know that, but-- And you said it yourself, Uncle Roland, what fun is life if you never take any risks? [Astonished laugh] Well, it turns out I've never taken any risks! Honey, we understand-- I don't even have any pets! Or a boyfriend, for that matter, and I would take a leave of absence from the firm, and... and... And that's my pitch. [Tia panting] Okay, so what do you think? You had me at "captain's license." You had me before you even started your speech, but it was lovely. Mm-hmm. Yes! Okay, so then I'm hired? Well, we obviously think it's a great idea, but... Right. I need to tell my dad. Yeah. Mm. You do know the Cahill case can put you on line for partner? I know, and this may sound crazy, but ever since I saw that boat, all I can think about is being on the water all summer long. I just think you could be making a big mistake and that all of this is... very impulsive. Didn't you impulsively give up a naval career to go into the private sector? Seems to have worked out pretty well for you. You make a good case. I learned from the best. You know, I'm just not convinced that this venture of Roland and Julie's even has a chance. They could lose everything. Or they could gain everything. The point is that they're willing to give it a try. Well... then I guess you'll go away and have your summer fun, and you'll see if it was worth it. Dad... Do you want my Mariners tickets? [Chuckles] The way they're playing this season? I'll miss you. Well, I certainly hope you will. [♪♪] Mom, do you think Dad will come down for the opening? Oh, I'm gonna start working on him now... [both laughing] But we'll definitely be there later this summer for John Hardwick's retirement party. Oh, wow! The Admiral's finally retiring? Mm-hmm. Have to go see him once I get settled. Oh, he would love that. He'll be very proud of you. Thank you. It's not the Navy, but at least I'll be sailing the Pacific Ocean. Yeah. Oh, and that's our skiff. Oh, great. [Gasps] "Des Mers..." I like it. Well, our cook is a French chef, and Des Mers means "of the seas" in French, so it made sense. Welcome aboard, Captain. Allow me to introduce your crew. Captain Larkin, this is Marcus Stapleton, First Mate. - Ma'am. - Hi. Pleasure to meet you. And Lucas Shaw, Chief Engineer. Look forward to working with both of you. Back at you, Captain. Would you like to see the bridge? She'll be up shortly, but first... We have a surprise for you. - Oh? - Right this way. [Gasps] We hope you like it. Are you kidding? This is gorgeous! You wanted to live onboard, and we wanted you to be as comfortable as possible. Well, now I may never want to leave. [All laughing] Well, great! All right, we'd better get back up on deck. Just come on up whenever you're ready. - Okay. [♪♪] Wow. [♪♪] All settled in? Yeah. I was thinking I might go down to the marina and the park and explore, maybe get a coffee. - Sounds good. Thank you. Whoa. - Hey. Oh. - Hi. This is, um... strange coincidence? Two times in one week. It's not really a coincidence, it's, uh, bad luck. But it also could be... serendipitous. Well, whatever it is, goodbye. Again. Goodbye. What are you doing? I'm going this way. So am I. To the marina? Uh-huh. To a boat? Yeah. It wouldn't happen to be the Pacific Yellowfin, would it? Yes, it would, Tia. I'm the chef. But you're not French. I'm half-French! Tia, w-what does that have to do with anything? Julie said they hired a French chef. Oh, Julie. As in-- Hold on a second. "Julie" as in Julie and Roland? Yes! They're my aunt and uncle. Oh, good. I'm the new captain of the Yellowfin. How is that even possible? I thought you were a lawyer! I am! I'm taking a leave of absence for the summer. [Deep breath, sighs] Okay. This is awkward. To say the least. Yeah, so tell me what we're gonna do about it because I don't think you or I are willing to walk away. Obviously not. Okay. Okay. If we have to work together, then I don't think that we should tell Julie and Roland that we know each other or that we have a past. How come? Because they have enough to worry about as it is. I don't want them having to think about whether there's gonna be friction between us. Oh, okay. Even though there obviously still is. I'll work on it. Okay. I will, too. Great. - Okay. - Mm-hmm. So then we agree. We will keep things strictly professional at all times. Absolutely. Great... great. Great. Okay, well, this shouldn't be too hard. I mean... Easy. I mean, you'll be in the galley, and I'll be on the bridge most of the time. Yeah. The galley. That's-- That's the kitchen, right? [Sighs] It's gonna be a long summer. [Julie] Okay, that's done. These are coming Friday. That's done. Oh, hey. Looks like you two have already met. We have. Yeah, it's actually like we're old friends, right? Well, I wouldn't exactly have phrased it like that, but... Right. Of course not. Uh, Jake, the table linens were just delivered. Can you take a look at them when you get a chance? Sure. How about now? - Great, yeah. They're in the galley. After you. You have no idea how lucky we are to have snagged Jake. Really? Yeah. Not only has he trained at the Cordon Bleu, but he's got all the makings of a five-star chef. Seems like a real stand-up guy. [Chuckles] Well, I just, uh, hope he can stand up on a moving boat while cooking. [Tia chuckles awkwardly] Tia helped me pick it out and she's got great taste. Yeah. You know, speaking of Tia, how long has she been a boat captain? Oh, this is her first time. But don't worry. She's more than qualified. No, I don't doubt her, not at all. I was just curious how she went from being a lawyer to-- to this. How did you know she was a lawyer? Oh, she just mentioned it to me when we were both walking onto the boat. Can I help? Oh... Sure, yeah. Can you hand me the threadlocker? Yeah. It's not a tool. It's the little red tube right there. Oh. [Chuckles] I guess that wasn't much help. No, it's the gesture that counts, so thank you very much. You work on the Pacific Yellowfin? I do. Yeah. I'm sorry. I'm Tia. Nice to meet you. I'm Bennett. Hi. And it looks like we're neighbors. That's my boat at the end of the dock. - The Seahawk? - Mm-hmm. Wow. I mean, she's a beautiful boat. Are you the captain? I am part of her crew, but nothing that illustrious. I'm just her owner. Oh. [Laughs] Don't be embarrassed. I've been mistaken for a deckhand before, so at least captain's a promotion. What about you? You the First Mate? Well, I don't mean to embarrass you, but I am actually the captain. Oh, I'm not embarrassed. I'm impressed. Maybe I'll see you around. More than likely. Hello... Oh. Hey. Thought you already left. Uh, yeah. No, I was... I was about to, I just thought I'd look around. You know, still getting the lay of the land. Well, we're on the ocean, but I get your drift. Ah, I guess that's your attempt at nautical humor. Have you ever cooked on open water before? 'Cause it can be a bit of a challenge. But that's your job, right? Keep everything smooth sailing? Well, I can't control the weather. [Both laughing] Look, just learn to roll with the tide and you'll do just fine. Well, I appreciate the tip, Captain. You're welcome. I will see you tomorrow. Okay. Have a nice evening. [♪♪] Mm. Julie... This souffle is fantastic. It's amazing. I mean, I haven't had something this good since I worked in the kitchen at the Breckinridge Cove Resort. The Breckinridge? Wow, that's high praise. Wait. Tia, didn't you work there one or two summers? Um, yeah, yeah. My last two years of college. [Computer chimes] Oh! Guess what? That is our first cruise sold out! - Whoo! - Awesome. - Wow! - That's amazing. Amazing. Uh! Across the table. There we go. Congratulations. And our next two cruises are almost at capacity. - Amazing. I have to keep pinching myself to make sure I'm not dreaming and this is really happening. Oh, it's happening, all right, and we have the bills to prove it. [Chuckling] Thank you. Don't suppose one of those is for me? Hey! No, I actually have a crew to feed. Speaking of your crew, I met your captain the other day. - Did you? - What's her story? Wha-- What do you mean? I mean, is she single? Bennett, I have no idea. You don't? No! Why would I? Come on. We're working professionals. It's not like we sit around all day and discuss our personal lives. Thank you. You know what? I can find out if she's single for myself. Okay, fine. You do that, but keep me out of it, all right? I mean, come on. She's my captain, which technically means she's my boss, so it could get complicated. Got it. Appreciate it. [♪♪] [Tia] Hey. Hey. I have your coffee. - Ah, thank you. - You're welcome. Was that, um, Bennett Jamiesen you were just talking to? - Yeah, it was, actually. He was the guy that recommended me to Julie and Roland. Oh. I didn't know you two were friends. Well, I mean, he came into my last restaurant and we got to know each other from time to time. Seems like a good guy. Yeah. No, he is... for someone who comes from a Nob Hill family. But if you ask me, I don't really think he's your type. I don't have a "type." Really? Because you used to. Maybe when I was 22. People change! I know I have. [♪♪] I have to say, this is a pleasant surprise. - The tacos? Yes, the tacos. No, I meant you inviting me out. Just being neighborly, but if you like these tacos, there's this little fishing village in Mexico named Chacala, where they're even better. I suppose the Seahawk has taken you all over the world? Almost every place where there's water. I assume you've done quite a bit of sailing yourself. Mm. Not to all the faraway places I dream about, but, for right now, I'm happy cruising the San Francisco Bay. I mean, there's just nothing like that feeling of wind in your hair and wondering what's on the other side of the horizon. Or the anticipation of adventure-- at least the possibility of one. Exactly. This just came for you. [Chuckles] So who's it from? Bennett. We had dinner last night. - You did? It's not like it was a date! We just went to the taco shack. Are you sure it wasn't a date? No! It was-- it was two neighbors grabbing a bite. Bennett's awfully charming. [Tia laughs] Jake thinks he's not my type. Jake is giving you dating advice? Mm. Just can't help himself. Is there something going on between you and Jake? No! Then why do I get the feeling that you two knew each other before there even was a Pacific Yellowfin? I thought we were doing a good job hiding it. Okay, you might've been trying to, but I could see that there was something more going on. Look, we just... we knew each other a long time ago. That's all. Jake's the guy you fell for when you worked at the Breckinridge, isn't he? Yeah, and the same guy who broke my heart. I mean... In all fairness, it wasn't entirely his fault. What happened? [Tia sighs] I was the sailing instructor and he worked in the kitchen for two summers, two wonderful summers. We even managed to see each other during the school year, and we made this pact that, after college, we would both follow our dream, no matter what. So Jake was going to the Cordon Bleu in Paris, and I was gonna go with him. I was gonna get a crew job on one of those riverboats on the Seine... But... then I got accepted to law school in New York, so I decided that I was gonna be realistic and stay. And that didn't sit well with Jake? Mm. He felt like I was letting both of us down by not following my dream, but I thought we could still make it work long distance. Jake didn't agree, so he broke it off and... I got hurt, more than I'd ever been hurt before. But it's all in the past now, and that is where we've agreed to leave it, so you don't have to worry. I promise. Okay. I'm glad, because, since our opening is in less than three weeks, Roland and I thought we should check out the competition, so I booked a table for the four of us on Wednesday night on another dinner cruise, the Franciscan. Okay, well, great. It's not a problem, okay? Really. That's good, because Jake already said yes. [Awkward chuckle] See you Monday, Captain. Have a good weekend, guys. Thanks. How much are these? You, uh, you want a melon that's ripe? That was my intention. Okay, well, you certainly don't want this one. Let's see here. Ah... [sniffs] That's better. That one's ready to eat. Thank you. No problem. You know, I'm glad I ran into you, not just because of the melon. I wanted to let you know that the cat is out of the bag. What do you mean? Julie figured out that we know each other from before, so we don't have to pretend anymore. Oh. Oh... To tell you the truth, I'm relieved. It's, uh, been pretty hard pretending you're a stranger. We used to know each other pretty well. Yeah, but that was a long time ago. You, um, planning on watching a movie tonight? How did you know that? Because you would always eat kettle corn when we watched a movie. Okay, fair enough. [Laughs] Do you still cry at the end of Casablanca? Oh, come on! I wasn't crying. Chopping onions. [Tia laughs] No. I didn't buy it then. I don't buy it now. - Really? - No. Okay. Well, then, I'm gonna settle this once and for all. Ah... There we go. Follow me. Excuse me. I was wondering if I could borrow your knife to chop this onion. He's a chef. Yeah. All right. Thank you very much. You ready? All right. [♪♪] I don't see any tears. Oh... no... Cheater! No, I'm really... [exhaling dramatically] It's happening! See it? No. No? You neither? Good. I'm not feeling anything. That's great. That's fantastic. Okay, fine, you win, all right? Good! Now give this nice man back his knife. Yes. Thank you. Thank you. What are you gonna do with all that onion? Oh, just wait and see. Hold on. It's a late reaction. [Huffs theatrically] [exhales] See? Look. - No. - No? No, not a thing. Not happening. Good chat. All right! Let's go. So what is all of this? This is going to be the herb garden for Des Mers. Now, when I was at the farmer's market today. I picked up a bunch of these herbs, and I was planning on planting them tomorrow, but I figured, hey, I'll start today. Want to help? Sure, yeah. What do we do? Well, first off, remember that onion I chopped up so expertly and didn't cry? Uh, I'm going to mix it in with garlic, cayenne pepper, and some water, and make an eco-friendly insecticide... Oh. But first, we need to plant something before we use the insecticide, so you choose. Oh, okay. How about these little yellow and purple flowers? Those'll look beautiful on the tables. I couldn't agree more. They will look beautiful, but unfortunately, these are edible flowers I put in some of my recipes, so why don't you start with that white one there, the beautiful white flower there, and I'll do these. Sounds good. All right. How are you doing over there? I think I am almost done. Want to check it out? All right. Not bad, not bad... a little crowded. Here, let me show you something. Okay. Pull this one up. Okay. Okay... Give it a little bit more room here. Dig a deeper hole, get some more space. What are you... Nothing. Okay. Now I'll let you do it. - Okay. Okay. - Put it back in there. Oh, yeah, I see. - Mm-hmm. - Much better. Then you've got to get all the soil away. Why don't you put that back in there? Okay. There you go. This is fun. Yeah? Was that your, uh, first time planting anything? - Yes. Yes, it was. - I can tell that by what's over here. Because this is, like... [cell phone rings] Hello? Hi, Tia. It's Julie. Hey. I just wanted to let you know that Roland had a little accident. He's fine, but his leg is in a cast. Oh, no! Oh, that's awful. Thanks. Is Jake there? We want to speak to both of you. Yeah, he's right here. I'm right here, Julie! Hey, Roland? Hope you're not in too much pain, buddy. Besides my leg, my ego is bruised. It's my fault, though. I was carrying boxes, not looking where I was going, and... well, I guess you know the rest. He's got to stay off his leg and keep it elevated for at least a week, so we're hoping that you two don't mind taking care of everything for a while. No, of course not. We got this. Yeah. No, we'll take care of everything, Julie. Just make sure he's okay. It's gonna be a challenge keeping him down. She's got that right! Uncle Roland, you'd better do what Julie and the doctors tell you. I will. I can't fight with all of you. [Laughs] Oh! And don't forget the dinner cruise is tonight. We'll just cancel that. [Julie and Roland] No, no, no, no, no! We have to scope out the competition! And we don't know when we could make it again. You two don't mind going without us, do you? No, no, we're going. Yeah, we're totally going. Yep. We're good! Great. Thank you so much. All right, we'll talk to you in a bit. Am I late? Hey! Um, well, apparently, we both are. Dinner cruise left an hour ago. I guess Julie told us the wrong time. [Laughs] No! Yeah. Well, you, uh... you look nice. Oh, well, thank you. So do you. Oh, thank you very much. Well, listen, since we missed the boat, no pun intended, it's not like we have to miss dinner. I know this great place down there, if you're game. Yeah. I'm starving. Yeah. No, me too. You know, I think we're the only couple here who isn't a couple. Really? Mm, maybe... but, you know, we're a couple of friends. At least I hope so. To friends. To old friends. Uh-uh, we're not that old. No, no! I don't mean old. I mean we go way back. - I know. - Is that better? - Cheers. - Cheers. Mm... it's nice. This place reminds me of that outdoor cafe we used to go to in Breckinridge. Remember? Oh, yes! The one where we never ordered any food. Well, we couldn't afford it! But we always had a glass of wine, remember? One glass of wine between the two of us. Yeah. They had to have known we were only there for the view. I'm surprised they never threw us out. I have a confession to make. I knew a guy that worked in the kitchen, and I... made a deal with him. - Are you serious? - Yes. What was the deal? I had to give him my recipe for my inside-out grilled cheese sandwich. [Gasping deeply] That was the best sandwich of all time. Really? You remember it? Oh, my gosh! I remember the first time you made it for me. That's right! That was the night you had the really bad sunburn, right? I have never had another grilled cheese that good. You know, over the years, I will be honest, I always thought about whether or not you finished law school. You did? Why? I just was hoping you'd have chucked it and found your place on the water, where you always wanted to be. I never had the courage. - Mm. - Until now. Although I'm only here for the summer, so... Right, well. Did you ever wonder whatever happened to me? I didn't have to. I knew you'd become a chef. Really? You were the hardest-working person I'd ever met. I did sometimes wonder if you'd ever gotten married. Oh, no. No. No... [laughs] Not me. You? Once, almost... but... I didn't, in the end. [Waiter] Here you are. Hey, uh, great. Thanks. Thank you very much. Thank you. Now... the real test... for old times-- Do you remember... this? [Clang] Bon appetit. Mm, this smells good. Ahoy! Permission to come aboard, Captain. Oh my goodness. Admiral! What are you doing here? Well... I was just talking to your mother, and I decided I couldn't wait any longer for an invitation to see your new commission. Well, I was gonna invite you after we officially opened, but since you're here, let me give you the V.I.P. tour. Ahh. Admiral! Sir. As you were. I'm gonna miss all this. [Both chuckling] Hey, Tia, I was just wondering if you had a minute. I wanted to go over-- Oh. Um, sorry, I didn't know you were busy. Oh, that's okay. Jake, meet Admiral John Hardwick. Also known as this young lady's godfather. It is an honor to meet you, sir. Thank you for the tour. You don't see many boats like the Yellowfin anymore, and it's good to see that she's being put to good use. - Mm. - When's your first voyage? - Day after tomorrow. - Yeah. Well, I'm sure you will do her proud. Thank you. [Admiral chuckles] It's good to see you. You too. It's a pleasure. Well, it's nice to get the Navy's stamp of approval. It sure is. So what's up? Oh, um, since Julie's not here, I was just wondering if you could fill in for her and taste some of my dishes. Sure! Um, can it wait, though? Because I was just about to meet Bennett for lunch. Oh! Yeah-- I mean, yeah. I mean, I di-- I didn't know you guys had gotten so friendly. Is that a problem? No. No, it's just an observation. Okay. Well, with your permission, I'm gonna be on my way. - Okay. - Okay. Permission granted. - Mm. Have a good lunch. Okay. That's a good chat. This is what you call a light lunch? I wasn't sure what you liked, so I got a little of everything... but, don't worry, whatever we don't eat will be donated to the foundation I work with. That foundation? The one that's sponsoring the concert? Yes. I'm one of those "Jamiesens." Oh. And I'm also on the board of the foundation. So that's what you do when you're not sailing? And I love it almost as much. The work we do always brings me back down to earth. I don't know. You seem pretty grounded to me, for someone who owns the biggest yacht in the marina. [Laughs] Yum. This looks great. Thank you. No problem. This smells amazing. Ah, I hope you're still hungry, because I have got steamed mussels marinating in white wine, tarragon, lemon, and butter and shallots. We also have, of course, some grilled French bread because, you know, you've got to have grilled French bread when you have mussels. We also have chicken paillard with lemon and black pepper, grilled potato with goat cheese Napoleon and basil vinaigrette. You know what? I think I could make room. Really? Okay, well, in that case, I'd like you to meet me back here in 10 minutes. You're on. All right. See you in 10. Mm-hmm. Don't be late! Jake, your food is unbelievable. Yeah, I know, and I appreciate that, but which one of these dishes is the most unbelievable? They're all delicious. I don't hear a preference. Jake... What? Whichever one you pick will be fine. Tia, I'm not looking for fine. I need fantastic. I think what you need is a break. You think? - Yeah. - Yeah. Find any interesting shells yet? No, but I found 26 cents in change, and I found this little piece of driftwood... kinda looks like a giraffe. No, that doesn't look like a giraffe. What are you talking about? Of course it does. Look at the ears, and there's a long neck, and there's this-- No, it's like a hummingbird. That's the beak. Okay, hummingbird, okay? We'll call it a hummingbird... and where are the treasures that you found? Come on! How do I find junk and you find beauty? I know. Well, maybe I'm just better at this. No, I just think it's because you're lucky. Oh, okay, mm-hmm. I'm just gonna put this right here so you can admire it, okay? Okay. Oh, really? Well, I'll put my hummingbird next to it. [Pebble splashes] Ooh! Oh! Yeah, you were close. That's not a wishing well, but nice attempt at trying to hit the buoy. I wasn't trying to hit the buoy. Really? But if I wanted to, I could. From here? - Yeah. - Come on! What, you think you could hit it? Let me think about that. Yes. Probably. - Oh, you're on. - Really? Mm-hmm. Okay. [Grunts] You go first. Age before beauty. That's close. All right, ready? Oh! All right. All right, this is the one. Okay. Agh! That was off by about eight feet. Just kidding. All right, ready? [Bonk] Yes! Got it! You were just lucky. That was a gust of wind. - Gust of wind? - Yeah. Lookit! There's nothing. It's skill. - [Cell phone ringing] - Hold on. - Wait. It's my mom. Hold on. - Oh, okay. [Dryly] How nice and convenient. [Laughing] Hi, Mom. What's so funny? Nothing, nothing. We're just goofing around. Well, I was just calling to give you a progress report. I'm just leaving Dad's office, and we're not gonna get down there for the opening. He wouldn't budge, huh? Well, he will eventually, and we'll be down in San Francisco in a couple of weeks for John's retirement party, so we'll see you then. And, hopefully, on one of our cruises? Well, I hope so, too. How's Roland doing? Hobbling around on crutches, but nothing could keep him from opening night. Well, I guess he's as stubborn as his brother. Well, good luck, sweetheart. Okay. Thanks, Mom. Love you. Look at what I found. You just found that right now? - Yeah. Isn't it beautiful? - What? - Yeah. - It's an abalone shell. Oh, my gosh... It's stunning. Isn't that gorgeous? Look at that. Well done. Well, thank you. Well, you know. In my spare time, I win buoy championships and pick up abalone shells. I think, um, this is your trophy-- - Is that it? - ...For hitting the buoy. [Tia laughs] I won. - Is it over there? - That's what I'm saying. - Thank you. - Oh, hey, thanks, man. - What is it? - Oh, hey. Maybe we should go to this. Concert's on Monday night, it's our night off, this would be fun. Um, I am going already. With Bennett. Oh, okay. Um... maybe-maybe we could all go together. No, it's fine. I mean, look, I don't want to be a third wheel. It's okay. You guys have fun. Please raise your glass. Julie and I would like to welcome all of you as part of this new journey in our lives. And thank you for helping to make it happen. Especially Tia and Jake, who really stepped up when I... ...Literally stumbled. To Des Mers! [Others] To Des Mers! [Overlapping] Cheers. [Clinking] All right, everyone, all hands on deck. The maiden voyage of Des Mers on the Pacific Yellowfin sails at 1800 hours. Good luck, everybody. [♪♪] [Roland] Well, if there's anything you need, you just let us know. Thank you for coming out on our maiden voyage and for bringing your friends. Yes. Thanks for having us. I'm looking forward to dinner. Enjoy. Thank you. Oh. 325 for 10 minutes. How are those mushrooms, Ryan? Get on those. I'm gonna make my rounds. Stay the course. Stay the course. Aye-aye. So it's not their first date. - No? - It's their first anniversary. How is everything? Good. I'm so glad. Are you enjoying yourselves? How's everything? - It's really good. - Great. Excellent. [♪♪] Having fun? Evening, Captain. Oh, hello. Hi. I just thought I'd bring you a little something to eat before it got all crazy down there in the galley. Thank you. That's very thoughtful. Well, for old times' sake. [Laughs] Inside-out grilled cheese! Ohh, that looks even better than I remember. You should try it. I'm getting good at it. - Thank you. - [Knocking] Permission to enter the bridge, Captain. Permission granted. Hey, Jake. Hey. Wasn't expecting to find the chef up here. Well, yeah, I mean, normally, you wouldn't, but Tia and I here, we go way back, so I just wanted to share an old memory with her. Grilled cheese sandwich? Yeah. You had to be there. Uh... there's enough for both of you. - Looks good. - Yep. Thank you. I came up here to ask if there's any chance I could get a dance later? I think that could be arranged. [Metallic grinding] [rumbling and clunking] Oh... oh. Honey? Okay, that did not sound good. You should head back to the main cabin. No cause for alarm, everyone. I'm told this boat is unsinkable. Lucas, I'm losing engine power. Can I get a report? Yeah, but you're not gonna like it. [Exhales] One of the cylinder heads cracked, so there's... no way we're getting that engine started tonight. I don't understand how this happened. Neither do I. We did a thorough check before we left the dock. I'm gonna have to call an emergency tugboat. What do we tell the passengers? Just tell them not to worry, and we will have them back onshore as soon as possible. Well, we can at least keep serving drinks, but, Jake, can dinner be saved? No. I mean, we were in the middle of cooking, but, you know, I'm pretty sure I can whip up some cold items. This restaurant may be the first one in history to open and close on the same night. Hey... sorry I'm late. Hey, that's okay. Julie and Roland aren't here yet. Okay. Did you see the review in The Chronicle? Review? What are you talking about? I didn't know there was a critic on board. How bad is it? Well, they mentioned everything that went wrong. Oh, that's good. Did they happen to mention the food? Only to say they couldn't critique it, because it was never served. Oh. On the bright side, they thought the boat was lovely. Oh, great. Got that going for us. I think I could use something a little stronger than coffee. How about you? You don't need to hide that from us. We've already seen it. Yep! - Okay. Yeah, so we had a long talk with Lucas, and he admitted that the engine failure was his fault. What? Yeah. It wasn't deliberate, but according to the mechanic fixing it now, Lucas used head bolts that are not compatible with a 1943 engine. Wow... Seems he wasn't entirely honest with us regarding his experience working on vintage boats. He was just in over his head, and he didn't know how to tell us. - That's on me. I take full responsibility for hiring him. And, Tia, if you wanted to go back to Seattle now, we wouldn't blame you. Yeah, we don't want you to feel obligated to us. I want this to work out as much as you do. I'm staying. It seems our next order of business is finding a new engineer. A new Chief Engineer. Lucas feels terrible about what happened, and we believe in giving people a second chance, so we'd like to keep him on as First Assistant Engineer if-- If you're onboard with that. Yeah. I think we can work with that. - Great. In the meantime, it's gonna take about 10 days to get all the replacement parts in and get all the repairs done. Well, I think our biggest challenge is how do we convince people to give us another try. We lost most of our bookings. We're just going to have to think of some way to drum up some business. Any ideas? [Tia] Advertising at the Summer Concert is a start, I guess. [Text alert chiming] Oh, it's from Julie. They're saving us a spot. - Perfect. [Roland] Okay... Yep. How are you feeling, honey? Oh, much better... much better. Isn't that Jake over there? Oh, yeah... Jake! Come and join us! We've got plenty of room. - Hey, come on. - Sure. [Singer] All right, hit it! ♪ On the other side of the street I knew ♪ ♪ Stood a girl that looked like you ♪ ♪ I guess that's deja vu... ♪ How are you doing? - Good. - Good. May I?

Hey. You know, when I didn't see you on the boat, I figured this is where you'd be. Yeah, I needed to think. I checked the website this morning. We still don't have any reservations. Yeah, I know that. That's why I'm here. I guess I just thought with all that extra advertising, especially the banner, that we would have had at least a few reservations by now. I'm fresh out of ideas. Short of calling in the Marines, I... I don't know what else to do. Not the Marines. The Navy. Let's go. [♪♪] Hi! Thank you for seeing us. - It's good to see you again. And you! You... yes, as well. Hope I didn't make it sound too urgent. Well, when you called and said you were literally on your way, I figured it had to be something important. Have a seat. All right. Now then... what's this all about? Your retirement party... Now, I know you're planning on holding it here at the base, but we wanted to suggest a different location. What do you think about holding it at Des Mers? - Aboard your new commission? That's an interesting proposition. I think the boat could be a perfect place for your party. As you know, it's a beautiful yacht-- And I can make any menu you want. He really could. I mean, he's a fantastic chef. And Tia's an expert sailor, so not even a drop of wine would spill. I have no doubt. And if you want, we could handle everything for you. Yeah, like every little detail, from the music... Decorations... really, anything you need. - Right. So... What do you think? Yes! Congratulations! Oh, ho! You did it! We did it! Well, yeah, I mean, we make a good team, you know, I've got to admit. Professionally speaking, of course. Right. Right, of course. I mean, that's all that hug was... professional. Right, yeah, but, you know, we make a... good team. Too soon? Okay. All right. Okay, so what are we looking for? Decorations. Last time we were here, I saw something I thought would be perfect for John's party. They were lanterns made out of rice paper. Yeah, wish lanterns. Yeah, I think that's what they're called. Yeah, I know where those are. They're right here. - Yeah, follow me. - Great. Hi! These what you're talking about? Yes! You know, I read somewhere that you have to write your wish on the inside of the lantern, release it up into the sky, and maybe your wish'll come true. I believe wishes can come true. So do I. [Both chuckling] Hi. We'll take them all. Yes. Do you think we got enough of these? Yeah, we've got more than enough. Tia, don't worry, it's gonna be a great party. Can I get a couple coffees, both with cream, please? There you go. Do you know what the best part is gonna be? I don't know, probably my cooking. Ha, ha. Besides that. I just realized that my dad is going to have to come on the boat. There's no way he would miss John's retirement party. Your dad doesn't approve of you working on the Yellowfin? My dad doesn't approve of the whole idea of the Yellowfin, but I think, deep down, what he's really afraid of is that I won't want to come back to work at the firm. Why would he think that? Because it almost happened once before. But that was the right choice for you, right? Maybe back then. Are you, uh, planning on staying after the summer? As crazy as it sounds... I'm considering it. Great! Thank you. Thanks. Have a good one. - Lucas? - Yep? Our work here is done. Excellent. Well, we're all set. The engine looks as good as new. Well, we are so grateful to have you onboard. Ah, well, far as I'm concerned, there's nothing better than working on these old vessels. You know, the Yellowfin's wooden hull, along with her draft and beam, are gonna make her performance smooth as glass, and from the way Admiral Hardwick's been singing your praises, sounds like you're just the captain for her. Thank you. He certainly speaks highly of you as well. [Laughs] Well, I guess he has to. We go way back. You know, I served under him for, ah, must be 20 years, before I became a civilian. So lunch is on. You guys ready? I am! You know, when I heard there was French cooking onboard, pretty much sealed the deal. Hey, Jake, how's it going? - Hey, man. - How are you? I'm great, actually. We just booked a party for tomorrow night. - Nice! - Yeah. Tia must be relieved. Yeah, well, you know, we all are. Right. I just meant because I know how worried she's been, and I came by to see if she wanted to get away for a few hours. Oh, yeah? Do you happen to know if she likes fishing? I know a great spot for striped bass. [Laughs] Actually, that's funny because she used to love fishing, yeah, but she always threw back whatever she caught. Yeah, I don't remember ever cooking anything we caught together. You know how frustrating that is for a chef? No, but I find her all the more charming for it. Sounds like you're getting, uh... pretty serious about Tia. Certainly wouldn't be hard to. Yeah, no, I know. I mean, she's a... she's a special person. Is Tia around? She's on the bridge. [♪♪] - Hey. - Hey! What brings you here? Came by to see if you wanted to go fishing when you get some free time. I love fishing, but you should know-- That you throw everything back? [Laughs] I do! How did you know that? I just had an interesting conversation with Jake. I know you two go way back, but you weren't just friends, were you? Uh... no, no, we weren't. But it's over now, so... I'm not so sure it is... At least, not for Jake. I like Jake, and he's a friend. Yeah, I-I like him, too. More than just as a friend? I don't know... but maybe. I think that's something you both need to figure out. Yeah. [♪♪] Tia... Where are you going in the skiff this time of night? I mean, come on. I know you don't have a car or anything, but I can give you a lift. Where I'm going, you can't drive. Really? Where's that? There's gonna be a meteor shower tonight, and the best viewing is far from the city lights. Really? Could you use some company? I ju-- I've never seen a meteor shower before. Sure. Hop aboard. All right. - Did you see that? - Ho! Whoa, that was so cool. How did I miss this all these years, right? It's pretty spectacular, right? It is... and you know what else is amazing is I feel like I'm so far away from everything, being out here, you know? I mean, that's what I love about sailing, too. It's not just about skipping across the waves, or the wind in your face, or that freedom that you feel, it's-- it's about the emotional connection we have to nature. Okay, so I have to ask you... how far out at sea are we? [Laughs] Don't worry, we're not that far offshore. Okay... I'd never worry being on a boat as long as you're at the helm. That's a lot of confidence to have in someone. I told you that a long time ago, and you probably just don't remember. No, I remember. You always had more faith in me than I had in myself. It wasn't hard... then or now. I always admired your confidence, you know, how you were able to just go after what you wanted without compromising. Well, that's not exactly true. Why? What do you mean? I lost you in the process. Look, Tia, it's been a long time coming, but I do owe you an apology... for how I ended things. I appreciate that... but just so you know, I'm not sorry about the path that I took. I mean, the truth is, back then, I wouldn't have been ready to do what I'm doing now. So you have absolutely no regrets from the past? [Laughs] None. - Oh! - You? I-- Yeah, I probably have a few. I'm not as evolved as you are. Oh... thank you. You're welcome. But I do know that I will not regret... ...doing this. [♪♪] I hope I didn't step on anybody's toes. You mean Bennett? Mm. Yeah. He made his intentions pretty clear to me. To me, too, and that's why we parted as friends. Really? Yeah. [♪♪] [Jake] Oh, that one was bright! Like, it lit up the whole sky. - Jake... - Yeah? Do you realize we've been out here for hours? Okay, what time is it? It's after 1:00. Whoa. We have a big day tomorrow. Well, now, today. Well, watching the stars was worth losing a little sleep. Well, you're gonna lose a little more sleep, because we seem to have drifted out with the tide. You know how to get us back, don't you? [Laughs] What happened to all that faith in me? Well, that was before you drifted us out to sea! [Laughing] Relax. We're just a couple miles offshore. It's not like you're going to end up on Gilligan's Island. Okay. [Phone texts chiming] Sounds like someone's trying to reach you. Yeah. It's my dad. Is everything okay? I've been offered a partnership in my law firm. Tia, that's... that's fantastic. I'm just stunned. You know, there was some talk of it after I won my last case. I just didn't expect it to happen this soon. I guess congratulations are in order, right? - Oh, yeah. Thank you. - Listen, I had a blast. It was so much fun and it's late. Probably need some sleep, so, uh... - Yeah. - I will see you tomorrow. Okay. Yeah. - Yeah. Bye. - Bye. [♪♪] [♪♪] Anything to report, gentlemen? Everything's in tip-top shape, Captain, and Lucas here is doing just fine. Glad to hear it. Thank you, Captain. I think I can go without these tonight, honey. Good, that'll be easier for you. How's it going, Captain? Well, I just finished the pre-departure checklist, and considering that we only had a few days to pull all of this together, I'd say we're in excellent shape. All thanks to you and Jake. And that's just what the crew does. We all pull together for each other. Hi, Dad. It's me. I'm calling because I wanted to talk to you before the party tonight. [Whistles jovially] [Tia] Dad, this is an incredible opportunity, and you're right, it's every associate's dream. I-I am thrilled to be offered a partnership, um, so please thank everyone at the firm for me... [floorboard creaks] ...But I'm gonna say no. And I know that you'll be disappointed that I'm not following in your footsteps... but I think I found where I truly belong. What's going on with that grilled cheese sandwich? Do you want it? Yeah. - It's yours. [Crunching] Mm! Jake, this is... I know. I know, it's amazing. Thank you. I'm working. Hey, Jake. Can I talk to you? I just called my dad... You know, can this wait? I'm just really busy. - Oh, yeah, of course. Sure. - Thanks. Aw... I didn't know you were so sentimental. That's sweet. - Sentimental? With what? From our treasure hunt at the shore. Yeah, I'm actually not that sentimental. I was planning on throwing those out. Why? I mean, I thought we had fun that day. We did. We had a great time, but we broke our agreement. What agreement? To keep our relationship strictly professional. Well, I'm pretty sure we broke that last night, when we kissed, too. Yeah, yeah. It was a very big mistake. Has something happened? I mean, I don't understand where all this is coming from. Tia, it's very simple. I'm here for the long run, okay? I've got to put all my focus on Des Mers. You can go out and do whatever it is you've gotta do, and that's fine, but I really think from here on out, we keep our distance and we stay out of each other's way and keep our relationship professional like we agreed. Jake... [footsteps] [♪♪] [sighs] [quiet chatter] Welcome aboard. Hi. Enjoy. Welcome aboard, Admiral. At ease. Well, everything looks just as good as you and Jake said it would... maybe even better. Well, we wanted to do you and the Navy proud. And you have. When do we get underway? 1900 hours, assuming everyone's onboard. [Sternly] Time and tide wait for no man. Aye-aye, sir. [Both chuckling] Enjoy. Thank you. Hi, Mom. Hi, Dad. We wanted to tell you how excited we are about tonight. Aren't we, Daniel? Of course. Well, I'm glad to hear it. I've missed seeing you guys. Oh, we've missed you, too, honey. And I'm, uh, glad to see you're up and about. How are you feeling? Oh, uh, almost good as new. Yeah. I'm sure most of that has to do with Julie. Ah, well, it wasn't easy keeping him from doing more than he should. You Larkin men are pretty stubborn. I couldn't agree more. Well, I guess we should go join the party. We'll catch up with you all later. Welcome aboard. Thank you. [♪♪] Thank you. That's for you. Okay, I'll be right back. [Background jazz playing] [Julie] There's a little wine needed there, and I think it's time to start clearing. Thank you. [Quietly] So... what's the verdict? Exactly as I expected. Everyone is raving about the food. Even the escargot? I wasn't exactly sure that was the right choice for this crowd. Especially the escargot. Several people even asked me to send their compliments to the chef. Well done, Jake. Ah, well, it takes a team. [♪♪] [♪♪] You know, it's been quite a while since we've danced in the moonlight. It is a beautiful night. And a beautiful boat, too, don't you think? You're not very subtle. Well, you have to admit they've done something pretty special here. The party? You know I'm talking about the boat. Okay... I'll admit it's nicer than I thought it would be, but not nice enough to give up a successful legal career. Are you disappointed because Tia isn't following in your footsteps or because she's following her own heart instead? [Sighs] Think about it. [Chuckles] Thank you. Thank you. [Clink] - Cheers. - Cheers. Your daughter is quite the skipper... and saleswoman. What do you mean? Well, she and Jake convinced me to move the party over here, and I'm certainly glad she did. I'm just not convinced about her decision to give up practicing law for this. [Astonished chuckle] You gave up a naval career to go out on your own. Isn't it fair that she should be able to do the same thing? [Chuckles] She used the exact argument on me. [Laughs] So why didn't it work? Probably because I'm been thinking like a lawyer instead of a father. Ever since she was little, she's only ever wanted to be on the water. [♪♪] Okay, everyone. Make your wish. Let's ready the lights! [♪♪] Is it all right if your old man joins you topside? [Tia laughs] You're not still mad at me? Maybe a little... but you know I can never stay mad at you for long. Good, 'cause you know I hate when we fight. [Laughs] Well, we're lawyers. That's what we do. And you're not even the only one who was mad at me today. Ah. Sounds like a rough day. Everything all right? An old flame just burned out faster than one of those lanterns... but I'll be fine. I have no doubt. So... I came up here to say something to you that I should have said earlier. I am very proud of you. After spending the evening on this boat, I can see now that it just wasn't some sort of whim. What you've all accomplished here, it's... it's really something. Well, I can't tell you how happy it makes me to hear you say that, because, honestly, Dad, as much as I love my work on this boat, it didn't feel complete without your blessing. Well, now you have it. [Tia chuckles] - Aw. - Thanks. And now I should go apologize to Roland. I guess older brothers can be wrong once in a while. It was a wonderful evening, thanks to all of you. And John couldn't be more pleased. We know. He made a dinner reservation for next weekend. We actually have a number of bookings, and a wedding for next spring. Well, looks like Des Mers is on track to be a huge success. Oh, and Jake, your food was delicious. I'm so glad you loved it. Thank you. And your desserts were to die for! Oh, thank you. So we see you all tomorrow at brunch. Oh, Jake, I hope you'll join us. I'm sorry, but I'm not gonna make it. If you all will excuse me, I just wanna check on my staff, make sure they've finished up everything for the evening. Good night. Thanks. And I should really go check on the bridge. Aww. I'll see you tomorrow. Daniel. Thanks for coming out. - Roland, congrats. - Oh, thank you. - Good for you. - I'm so glad you liked it. I did. [Chuckles lightly] [♪♪] [sighs] Even just one looks beautiful, huh? I thought you finished for the night. Yeah, no, I did, I, uh... but then I just realized I had something unfinished. [Exhales deeply] Couldn't it wait until morning? No, it couldn't. It's too important. And if I didn't do it tonight, then I would regret it, and you know how much I don't like regrets. Well, if you wanted to talk to Julie and Roland, they've already left. I don't want to talk to them. I want to talk to you. You made yourself clear today. I-I'm perfectly fine with keeping our relationship strictly professional. - And maybe I'm not so fine with it, Tia. You know... it took me seeing and looking at that seashell and that old bottle... ...to bring me perspective on a few things... and, truthfully, when you said that that day was so much fun-- and it was, but it was more than that to me... because that was the day that I realized that I'm still madly in love with you. So I guess you didn't throw them away? [Laughs] No, I didn't. I lied. I am sentimental. [Both laughing] Look. I know being a partner in your law firm's... it's a huge deal, and I don't want to get in the way of it at all, okay? But I also don't want to make the same mistake I made 12 years ago. I don't care if we have a long-distance relationship, Tia, I don't. I just want you to know I'm gonna do everything I can to make it work. You'd do that for me? I'd do that for us. Maybe I can come up and visit you on my days off, or I'll get Julie and Roland to... bring the boat up to Seattle once in a while. What do you think? That's an amazing gesture, but I don't want a long-distance relationship. Huh. Well, you... you were okay with it once before. Well, yeah, but now it wouldn't make any sense. Why not? Because I won't be in Seattle. I didn't take the job. [Laughs] I don't understand. How could I take that job when everything I have ever wanted is right here? [♪♪] [chuckles] [Jake] What'd you wish for? It doesn't matter, because it just came true. [♪♪]
