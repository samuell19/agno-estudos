Today he was walking in the Tuileries hand in hand with Countess de S?rizy. And what is the young man's name? I sat next to Cat and saw him - so beautiful. Oh, my father, just radiant. The ladies sitting next to each other said:.. ... "This is Countess de S?rizy with young Lucien de Rubempr?. " Lucien de Rubempr?. If you want to marry me, .. ... find me a husband similar to him. I don't know him. Nobody was watching you? You know me. So what? Baron this morning visited the prefecture of the police ... ... and came out very pleased. That evening he told his wife .. ... that they found out who the stranger was from the forest of Vincennes. It's a done deal, that's what he said. They're watching us, but who? Nucingen turned to Louchard. Louchard - this is an empty hole. The Baron found someone better. Okay, but the command:.. ... every night around ten o'clock you will take an Englishwoman to the forest of Vincennes. If someone notices you and they will watch, don't stop him. Be sociable, let them bribe. Talk about Lucien de Rubempr?, say he's crazy about Madame, .. ... very jealous and hides her, .. ... just like she's a treasure of the Turkish Sultan. Do you understand Did you understand me? He understood. He gave me the other half of the bill, .. ... but I want to warn you arranged for a tour of the large house. That's great. No doubt you will need me. Only connect to numbers 7, 10 and 21. We have to use all these people so .. ... so as not to attract attention shelves and prefectures. I am Mr. Saint-Germain. Get on. But you make fools of us, this costs nothing. Yes, no, really, it's not mine. I'm closing my business due to urgent circumstances. I think you know i have other names, .. ... which they told you in the police prefecture. Do you know about that? Baron, tell me about your problem in as much detail as possible. There was no doubt about makes him smile. I'm sure he knows. What's his name? Lucien de Rubempr?, Mr. Rastignac's friend. That is, to be honest, rather the environment of my wife, .. ... but in society with more talks about this Rubempr?. Really? Today I hear his name for the second time. Well, what do you think is this the right way? Believe me. Look, Baron, .. ... first give me 10,000 francs for operating expenses. Ten thousand francs? What will you spend for? Backup - this is completely natural. I hope you don't bargain with me. I'm not, as you know, a vulgar spy. I was the chief of police in Amiens. When King Louis died, I'll tell you .. ... that I've been in charge for 7 years secret police. I'm solving your problem, .. ... don't worry and don't worry. Don't you need anything? It's beautiful outside. You can't go out. But I have something for you. Letter from Lucien. Go on. Well, two vagabonds they tried to get me drunk, .. ... they stopped me, they wanted to talk. I didn't know what but I don't think they believed me. Well done, the little fish has already swallowed the hook. Preparatory documents folder is ready. Yes, it is difficult to predict exact numbers, of course, they will be different. But we can guarantee that independence of authorities, inter alia. I hope you understand what's at stake, .. ... so it 's the best way. Isn't it? But my dear friend, this is the first time you ... What? And, yes, yes, yes. Later, I have something else in my head now. Number 21 has interesting news. Can the Baron accept me? And how do you want to report? Tell Monsieur the Baron, .. ... that I came from the Champs-Elys?es. I came in the Peyrad case. Finally, finally. Sit down. So, it's been a whole week, what await the news from you. Mrs. Rubempr?'s mistress lives in Taitbout Street, .. ... in a former apartment Madame de Bellefeuille, .. ... Mr de Granville's former mistress, Attorney General. But there I was like on a small vacation. How ridiculous. Just around the corner from here. It often happens that they look far, and required next door. Monsieur de Rubempr? is very jealous of his lady and hiding her. So much so that in 4 years, what Mrs. Bellefeuille inherited the apartment, .. ... no one in the house - not even the doorman, not even the owner of the house - they haven't seen it yet. They go for walks only at night, .. ... hidden behind a veil, in a carriage with the shutters lowered. Lucien has a special reason jealously guard the woman. He's going to marry Clotildou de Grandlieu ... ... and besides, he's intimate friend of Madame de S?rizy. Naturally, he carefully hides his mistress. If a connection to this was revealed girl, everything would go wrong for him. So you are the master of the situation. I understand everything. That's a good job. Monsieur, in exchange for this information, .. ... that cost us several sleepless nights, .. ... my friend Peyrad is waiting for you appropriate kindness, .. ... and me too. What kind? Well, money, of course, to cover costs, .. ... but my friend from you he expects something else. The way he showed you the service, shows .. ... how can this man be useful in the common interest. You have great contacts. Convince the Minister that .. ... that Peyrad can return to your place. My friend would be very disappointed, .. ... if you refuse provide him with this service. I'll see what can be done Believe me. You talked about costs, am I right? Maid your unknown from the street Taitbout's name is Eugenia. Give her a few thousand francs. After that amount, you can overcome all obstacles. He'll hide you in the room, where her mistress sleeps. But if he doesn't agree? In this case, you should strengthen your arguments. No, no, no, please, not here. Thanks again. Felix, listen, .. ... call my cat George. Urgently. Come on. George, my friend, everything is ready, I know where he lives! Go to Taitbout Street, look for the house, where Mrs. Gobseck lives, .. ... and there, very carefully, find a maid named Eugenie. Ask her to invite me to visit, as soon as possible. Your well-being will be ensured, .. ... if you protect my interests ... ... and you say a word for me. But I'm an honest girl, Mr. Baron. I will pay well for your honesty, everything has a price. It's not that easy. And if Mr. Baron will not madam like, i will lose my place. This place costs a thousand francs a year. A thousand francs a year, well, that means return on capital 20 thousand. I'll give them to you. If you ask a question this way, take note of others. Here. You pay for the place. And what about my honor, decency? Honor costs nothing but I'm adding another five thousand. Let's agree this:you'll hide me in your room until .. ... until your mistress is left alone. If you swear to me, .. ... that you and no one will ever tell anyone about my help, I agree. But I warn you, .. ... Madame loves Monsieur de Rubempr? and they won't exchange it for a million francs. Enough, I know this kind of women. Look at her and don't be surprised. And so, in the evening Madame goes for a walk. I can hide you in my room. If she returns alone, .. ... I'll take you to the salon and leave the door to her room is open. Everything else - your thing. Good? I'll give you 25,000 francs in the salon. Don't cheat on me. Be on Taitbout at midnight .. ... but it will bring 30,000. Decent maid service after midnight they are more expensive. Don't call yourself so much it can be annoying. No no no, don't wear a white tie. So which one? This one in the style of an empire.

Before offering them to a girl, better if you put them on my earrings. Turn around, I'll look at you. Unfasten and secure The last button of the vest is fashionable. Look at Mr. de Marsay. Or Rastignac. My dear to tonight passed successfully for you, .. ... I wish you to enjoy today took the example of Mr Rastignaca. You are a woman of two faces, Madame de Nucingen. You are a free thinker, Mr. Nucingen. That is her. What time is it? In your opinion, time passes slowly. Night time. Admit that the images which run in your brain, .. ... costs much more than 30,000. I feel like a pretty young man, and in love. Don't move, I'll come to you. Oh, that's life! That stops everything. Don't make noise. Quietly, fat elephant. A fat elephant? Is that you, Lucien? Monsieur, who are you? Who are you? Help! There's a robber! Europe! Don't shout, madam. Don't worry, no, no. No, please. The man in Madam's room, how terrible. I'll call someone now. Police. Wait a minute. I think you're bad and you're kidding me. I? Madam, you are really in love to Monsieur de Rubempr?? And I'm proud of that. What do you dare? I'm sorry, ma'am. You will get expensive jewelry tomorrow ... ... with an apology from Baron de Nucingen. Baron de Nucingen? This is the poor man in front of you, ma'am, and very embarrassed. They made us a good day. Dear Madam, I am afraid that .... Madam, what is it? Jewelry on the face of a beautiful woman, and you are beautiful, madam. But because of your beauty, I can't forget here .. ... which I was hoping to find here tonight. He ran away, I swear, with tears in his eyes. I saw that George, his cat, he loaded it into a carriage. Here's the money. Beautifully played, she has a beauty. A big fish was caught. You can go back to your mistress. You should repeat another piece of the role ... It wouldn't be better if Did Monsieur Lucien satisfy the Englishwoman? That's a real tiger. What happened an animal awoke in her. I am going. I'm going too. Life, 30,000 francs, .. ... that's the first drop, which this waterfall will give us. He needs to be prepared. Give me one of your cigars. I recently got them, I hope you enjoy it. The Baron will not stop there. He will regret the lost 30,000 francs ... ... and grabs them by the throat. He refuses the help of agents. No need for the police or anyone another poked his nose into our affairs, .. ... it's dangerous. And I have the perfect medicine to reassure both bankers, .. ... and his agents. You will go to Madame de S?rizy, and you will be very tender to her. Do you understand? Very tender. You say you need her to solving a very sensitive problem. You lent the apartment to Rastignac. Some lady spy was watching you, you're not involved in anything, but .. ... they're watching you everywhere, and that is unbearable. Above all, you are not at all lover of Madame de Nucingen, .. ... it is so? Do what you want but you have to persuade her, .. ... to get involved her husband, .. ... Minister of State. I'll leave it to your discretion a way to achieve results. Her husband will your guarantor for the prefect of the police. Yes, prefect. In front of the prefect, scatter in complaints, but with the proverbial arrogance .. ... as a man with high protection ... ... and influential acquaintances in society. Bubble any a phrase about freedom of personality, .. ... privacy and ask to keep your visit a secret. The prefect will understand. It is in the image of social customs and is afraid he will be misunderstood, .. ... misinterpreted. I will use all my options, to protect your peace. And from now on he will take on ... ... worry about success our future business. Tell me if you visited by Mr. Nucingen, .. ... I asked you to refer the matter to Peyrad? That's right, prefect. I've never experienced it before similar humiliation. The prefect did not allow me to say one word. I stood in front of him on the carpet, and he paced the office. He told me not only canceled my annual pension, .. ... but that he will appoint me special monitoring. Who intervened in this matter? None other than the baron. He got everything he wanted from us. We found him unknown to him, and he decided to save money. But I will avenge him. And I'm counting on you my dear Corentine. In memory of all this, which connects us to you. You have a nice place, .. ... you are at the head of the secret service, in the heart of the police. We will deal with this matter. I remember everything well, what I owe you. First, we need to know if the baron is an informant. I saw him he doesn't seem to be able to deliver. I think there's something else about it .. ... I don't know yet, but something else. I feel it. May be. But if it's not a baron, ... Don't you think it's Contenson? Of course not. Leave it to me, I'll do it. You won't kill. Mainly because of the prefects they are not eternal, and in our time, .. ... they here and there they begin to turn. I'm in the shadows, I stay in my place. Regimes change, but they all they need what i know. And I'm there and that. Trust me. I'll do the investigation tomorrow, what happened to Nucingen. All right, hi. Give it to your master. "If Mr. de Nucingen will so kind and will appear today ... ... around midnight in front of the Chateau de Vincennes ... ... and blindfold, .. ... bring him there, where he will see the one he is looking for. " If I wasn't here, I would think so. I found this in my seat. There is little light here, I can't read. I have good eyes, Baron. "What a price the baron is willing to pay ... ... for meeting your stranger? " This is what George himself told me. I should have smeared it a little. Repeat the contents of that letter. How much does the baron pay for a foreigner? ... or something. We have something to do with fraudsters, who vacuum us. They are going to sell the woman very dear to the baron. I want to know who cheated on me. Baron de Nucingen is ready to run through a vein, .. ... and it's in his veins lots of banknotes. Maybe there's wine my Lydia, and I'll get him. Nothing is lost the game is just beginning. I'll turn into a bedbug, .. ... penetrate any crack, I will listen and watch. First, we learned two things:.. ... who owns this woman and who complained to the prefect. Maybe we're in for a surprise, and not necessarily bad.
