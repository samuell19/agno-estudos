THE CASTLE OF PURITY I'm done. Want some help? Quiet. Don't interrupt. There's no talking during work. One hour, Voluntad. Beatriz, someone went through my stuff. Nobody goes into your room, Gabriel. Only you have the key. Porvenir, were you in my room? - No, not me. - Then it was Utopia. No, Father. I haven't even gone upstairs. Do the statue of happiness. - Do the statue of death. - No, not that one! - Yes! That one! - Do the statue of war, Mom. No! I say what! Do the statue of death. Hey, don't bother. An old man lives alone there and he left early. Oh, excuse me. Here, go hang it. - All is well? - Yes, Father. May I? I brought you a gift. Come. Sit with me. - Smell. Do you like it? - Yes. This cream is excellent for the hands. Put some on. Let me put some lotion on you. - I'll be downstairs. - Gabriel. Thank you very much. Thank you, Beatriz. Hand me some bread. You didn't dry your hands. It's rude to talk during meals. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. Eight. Seven. Six. Five. Four. Three. Two. One. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. Eight. Seven. Six. Five. Four. Three. Two. One. - I want water. - Wait. Okay. Next one. I want to see the ocean. Don't say that or Father will get mad. I'll tell Mother to take us. Why tell her? You know we've never gone out, we never will. Anyway, I want to see the ocean. Remember when Mother told us about it? - She said it is real pretty. - But going out is bad. It's horrible outside. And the goddess of the sun, offended and sad... ...went into a cave located... - Located. Located at the foot of an enormous mountain... - Enormous. - Enormous. Once inside, wishing she forgot the world... ...and her husband's ingratitude... ...she closed the entrance with a very heavy rock. Thanks to the help of some invisible pages... ...who arrived on quick lightning bolts that came... - That came. - That came from the king. - Who is the king? - The sun. Let's not read anymore. Tell us something. What do you want me to tell? Stuff. When I was Voluntad's age... ...I played at the river every afternoon. I made paper boats. Like those Porvenir makes. - Make me one! - Wait. One time, some bulls showed up... ...and suddenly, one came loose... What are bulls like? You saw them in your sticker book. They're the animals with horns. They're beautiful but very aggressive. Are they edible? People that eat meat eat them. - We don't. - What did the bull do? It chased me. I screamed and ran, I was so scared. But it didn't catch up to you? No. They killed it. Come and sit down. - Did you study the maxims? - Yes. Tell me Goethe's. "A man with a strong will... ...shapes the world at his taste" Goethe. Very good. Now, Ellis. "To find men, you must turn your back on humanity" Ellis. I don't understand. That if you're going to be superior to other people... ...you mustn't pay attention to what they say or do... ...but live as you know how you should live... ...so that later you can set your example. - Yes. - Don't yawn! I'm speaking! - Did you understand? - Yes, Father. Chesterton. "All men are common men. Extraordinary men are those sure that they are." - Go to your room. - Yes, Father. Don't move, son. I could cut it wrong. - You hold my head. - You have very pretty hair. It's gotten really thick. Look. It's your first cut. Touch it. Feel how soft it is. Don't mix it up! - This is Utopia's. - Let me see! - Porvenir's is prettier. - What about me? Here is yours. But don't touch it. - Don't move. - Don't move! - What did you say? - I didn't say anything. My love! My love! My love! My love! The kids are downstairs, they could hear us. It's always the same with you. You only think of yourself. You have no right. Gabriel, please. Come here. You were always surrounded by men. You think about them all the time... ...even though you pretend not to think! - Go to the kitchen. - Lunch is ready. Clean the machines. I'm hungry. Bring food to my room. Yes, Father. He's mad again. Your break is over! Go back to the shop. Do you know how many corpses could fit here? - You didn't eat a thing. - I'm disgusted. There are rats everywhere. They're not dying. We have to make stronger pesticides. They're not eating what I put out for them. They warn each other of the danger some how. Tell me something. Rats and mice hate each other... ...can you imagine giving them something to drive them crazy? To have them kill each other? Every day millions are born. The newborn females, before they leave the nest... ...are already pregnant. If they were fighting or eating their spring... ...they wouldn't have time to reproduce. It's instinct. Beasts only seek pleasure. By reproducing they pass their horror and filth. It's a circle that'll only end at the end of time. It's the same with people. You know men by studying rats. They're the same! That's why I don't want you in contact with the world. It's best you stay inside with the rats... ...than seeing the best people out there. Why are you saying this? Don't speak like that. You can't compare people with rats. Besides, you've always loved your children. Yes, but they're different. How can they be if they have never been outside? Don't you see? We haven't gone outside in 18 years. 18 years without seeing the street. You dare complain? On the contrary, I have always been happy with you. There's nothing better than living with a man like you. I don't need anything else. These 18 years have been wonderful. I don't need to go out. Remember when we moved? Utopia was a newborn. Voluntad has never seen the world outside. There isn't a way out. If it hadn't been for that, where would we be? You knew the world. You know how it is. I see it when I go out. It was a good decision. The proof is that the kids are healthy, pure, happy. If they were in the world they'd have been corrupted. Can you imagine Utopia? Poor thing. What a surprise! How nice to see you, Mr. Gabriel. I'm here as always to trouble you. Are you feeling better, Mrs. Luisa? The same. Old people are hopeless. Don't say that, Mrs. Maria Luisa. You'll bury us all. How many bags should I leave? How many? A dozen and a half, please. Only a dozen. We still have some from last time. Let me see. She'll be with you in a second. Twelve. Here you go. Thank you very much. Have a good day. How many do you want? No, I'm sorry, Mr. Lima. I can't take anymore. Look, Mr. Lima, this is more profitable. It's very requested because of the commercials. But that's crap! Can't you see? My product is better because it isn't industrialized! It's done by hand. That can't even kill a fly! Haven't you noticed? It's in polyethylene bags. Do you know it's an indestructible material? It'll be in dumpsters till the end of time! I'm really sorry, Mr. Lima. - Let's start the game! - Are you finished? - Yes. - Well, then let's go. Okay! One, two, three! - I'll catch you, Voluntad! - No! No! I'm coming after you, Utopia! Utopia, stop! Utopia! No, Porvenir! No! Enough, Utopia! Come and help me! Your father doesn't want you to read... ...things he doesn't give you. If he finds this, he'll get mad. Go on, I'll be right back. I'm going to my room. One moment please, Mr. Gabriel. We've missed you, Mr. Gabriel. Haven't we? - Shall I leave a dozen? - Of course, Mr. Gabriel. - Excuse me, Mr. Gabriel. - It's not a problem. I need to see you alone. You'll profit from it. I want you to sleep with me. I'll pay you. Are you insane? If my mother finds out you'll be in trouble. Here you go. Count it. I have to tell you something. You won't get mad? What is it? Take care of your daughter. She's very flirty. - Excuse me? - She's very flirty. - What? - She came on to me. Really? I wouldn't tell you if it wasn't true. I never lie. Take care of her, ma'am. Take good care of her. - She could get lost. - Thank you, Mr. Gabriel. You're coming with me! I'll take you to a place only I know of! - I'm glad you're home. - I want to be calm. Dad is home! Dad is home! - Put everything as it was. - Yes, Father. - We'll end up starving. - What? Nobody wants to buy our product. They say that junk made in factories is profitable. Don't worry. Ours is better. It can't be if they're not asking for it. - Gabriel... - We'll starve, I'm telling you! Tomorrow, cut the food rations. We'll use less energy and all those luxuries. Say goodbye to your make-up. - I use them to please you. - We'll starve! Don't be like that. Don't worry. I'm sure everything will be all right. I'm tired! I don't want to work anymore. We have to hurry! We're down 100 bags. What were the men like before you met me? You didn't tell me exactly how many. Please, Gabriel, don't start. This conversation never ends well. I warn you, it's worse not knowing! Gabriel, you know everything about me! I know nothing. I'm going to kill you! I'm going to kill you! Your mother tried to hurt herself with this. I had to yank it from her! Don't tell your brothers anything. I'm sorry! I'm sorry, Beatriz! You have to help me. I'm so scared. Don't be scared. I love you, Gabriel. I don't care about going outside... ...you think I would've tolerated this with another? How many people will there be in the year 2000? - Seven billion. - Very good. How many children die of hunger every year? Three million and a half. The more people there are... ...the more crime and addiction there'll be. It's natural. People don't know how to coexist. Everything is wrong. And it'll get worse. - Can I turn it on? - Yes. The birth of the great Celtic. Under terrible shadows, a King will be born... ...and will be feared by all. His ancient blood will be reborn in him... ...and his Age of Bronze will turn to Gold. It means this king will govern with patience and kindness. He'll give a different face to his race. Thanks to his teachings the Bronze Age... ...a time of violence and wars... ...will become an Age of prosperity. A Golden Age. He'll open the bronze doors by force. The King will bring down the Temple of War. They will no longer use citadels and forts. The world will find peace with his guidance. You understood this? The Great City will be like a desert. Those who lived in it are surely dead. It's streets deserted by looting and rape... ...and it's temples in ruins by profanation. Nostradamus saw clearly what is happening. You can go to bed now. We'll stay and work a while. Good night, Father. Good night, Mother. Sleep well. Dear Minister. I waited in vain for a month for your answer. I suppose you haven't answered me back... ...because my enemies told you there is a contradiction... ...between my ideas and my personal and work life. Why if I defend existence in all its forms... ...do I make a living producing pesticides? - I make a living? - Producing pesticides. And I answer you: there is no contradiction. Rats are man's enemy. They destroy his crops, they loot their storages... ...they transmit diseases... ...and they've even devoured small children. So they must be completely annihilated by the strongest. Their only true strength, like all the weak... ...is its enormous reproductive capability. There must be no mercy. It's a matter of life or death. You're it! You're falling! And only with inexorable energy... ...we will be able to bring the final catastrophe. Sincerely, at your disposal, Gabriel Lima. That's right. I'm very tired. That letter you dictated was beautiful. I think he will answer me this time. Your thoughts are extraordinary. What you say is true. I hope everything comes true... ...so people will know who you are. Take me to bed. Gabriel, what are you doing? Nothing. An experiment. Someone's been knocking for a while. I'll get it. Mr. Gabriel, I thought you weren't home. I'm sorry, Inspector, I didn't hear you. There was a lot of noise. Come in, please. This house needs some plastering. Why don't you hire someone? No! I'll do it myself. Be careful because it's dangerous. With the rain, these old houses could fall. A man! Hello, how are you? What's new? - Good morning. - Here's the paperwork. Let me see. Things have gotten rough. I don't know if I can authorize your product. What do you mean? I've never had a problem with you. My paperwork is in order. Yeah, but you know how things are now. What things? Isn't it dangerous to have so many rats? - They're all vaccinated. - At least. - Aren't you scared of them? - I'm used to them now. What do you say? Do I authorize or not? Yes, authorize it. Very well then. Because you say so. You have a 47.50 percent of royalties. Show me your sales permit. Oh, it's being processed, right? - Yes. - Thank you, sir. Can you give me some samples for the lab? Sure, take as many as you like. Thank you. Good bye, Miss, it's been a pleasure. - You damn flirt! - No! No! Let me go! No! Gabriel! Leave her alone! Stop it! Are you insane?! Don't you see what you've done?! Stay out of this! I know what I'm doing! - It's for her own good! - That's what you think! Look at what you're doing to your kids! My children are not like that! You are against me! I've given you everything! Look what you've done! I'm going to kill! My poor baby girl. Tell me what happened. I don't know, Mother. I don't know. Don't cry, my love. Calm down. I don't want him to hit me! Stop crying. You're prettier now. Look in the mirror. You see? I had my hair like that when I met your father. Who would've imagined all of this then? He'd go to my house to visit. We spent hours talking. He told me that when we got married... ...we'd have a lot of kids and our family would be unique. He's really kind with me. I do as he says because it's for our own good. But he should never have touched you. You're so young. Gabriel has changed. He's so strange now. Sometimes even I am afraid of him. Two pork tacos, please. - With our without salsa? - With, please. Thank you. They were knocking for a long time. - Didn't you see who it was? - No. It must've been the water guy. I've told him never to come after 9 a.m. Call the kids. I have a surprise. I brought you these toys! Look at them. I won't give them to you now, but in a few days... ...that way you'll really enjoy them! They're really pretty, Father. Thank you. Did you bring me a shovel? No, but I got you more animal sticker books. Thank you, Father. I have to tell you something. As of tomorrow in this house there'll be no more yelling. I want us all to get along. - Gabriel? - Yes? The garbage truck is here. I'm going with you! Move, girl. Get inside! Thank you. Wait in the living room! Idiot! Why'd you let them out?! - Shit! - Please, Gabriel. - You are just like your mother. - Why? Why?! I turn my head and she hit the streets! I can't live in this house! It's all your fault! I tried to save them from the world but I couldn't. - It's your inheritance! - Gabriel, nothing happened. Sit there. I married you out of pity! I always pitied you! I never felt anything else for you! It's all your fault! You'll never get away with it! Go bathe. Voluntad! Voluntad! She's not here! What is it? Tell her to bring me the towel! I'll lend you mine. Wait! Throw it over! Bastards! Dogs! Disgusting! Dogs! You bitch! - No, Father! - You bastard! - No, Father! - Disgusting! - You bastard! - Father! You damn bastard! Fucking bastard! - No! - You pig! Fucking bastard! I won't tolerate this! You disgust me! You pigs! - Stop it! - Move! - You have no right! - I haven't?! Calm down, I'm sure they haven't done anything wrong. Nothing wrong?! They're worst than rats! - Gabriel! - Move! - You have no right! - I do! Now you'll see! You'll get your comeuppance! Look what you've done. Look! Calm down, Gabriel! Please! It's your fault. It's all your fault! Look what you've done! You screwed everything up. It's your fault. It's all over. I failed. Nobody has ever understood me. Nobody. Not even you. No, Gabriel, everything will be the same. It had to happen. You never talked to them about those things. But they're children. They love you as much as I do. I've always loved you, Gabriel. Remember when we were young and we went to the country? Everything was so beautiful. You were always happy. Weren't you? They were good times. You told me that we should live... ...without others interference. Everything was alright... ...but I knew something would happen. You never thought of what this would become in time. Everything's changed. I did your will for my children. For them and the peace of this house... ...a peace you don't see, understand or appreciate. But you know I love you so much... ...and you take advantage of that. Give it some of this. It's new. Two hands. - Done, Father. - Good. Leave it. Do rats eat meat? Yes. Only those kinds of animals eat meat. - What does it taste like? - Blood. Horrible. Now. It's dead, Father. Voluntad, one day we'll make these traps. They're called "El Castillo". I saw them in a German magazine years ago... ...but I perfected them. It's like a snail. The rat goes through this door and can't get out. It reaches the center where there's cheese. When it's about to eat it, the floor sinks. The rat falls into a bucket of water and dies. 10 can drown in one night. It's really pretty. Here. Let them out. Hang this. I don't like this. It has too much garlic. From now on you'll be far from your brother! You'll sleep with the light on! When I go out, you'll stay in your room! Women are to blame for everything. Because of you! I was weak because of you! You made them disobey me! You plotted everything! It's your fault! I'm going to kill you! Here, take this to my room. - What did he say? - Nothing. He didn't even talk to me. I'm really scared. I've never seen him like this. What you did was wrong, try to understand him. Don't be afraid. You know I love nobody like you. Nobody. That's not true. You love my father more. You remind me so much of him... ...but you're so different. - I liked it outside. - Outside? Yes. - Is this sugar? - Yes. - Eat a bit. - Okay. - I love you, Porvenir. - Me too, Mother. Help. Better yet, help us. Yes, that's it. My Father has us locked up. He has us all locked up. Now he wants to kill us. We live at Gonzales #99. Come quickly. Utopia. Gabriel? I was just with a girl. Really young. She was a virgin, unlike you! No wonder there's never been purity here. It's all lies, why do you say that? You have no right! I've been nothing but faithful and tolerant! I did everything you asked, I always did your bidding! I've had to live with what you make up! I can't anymore. I can't take it! - What's wrong with you? - What's wrong?! How dare you?! Leave me alone! Get out of my room now! Honey! Don't be like that. Don't be like that. Beatriz, honey, what's wrong? What's wrong? What is it? Beatriz, I love you. I love you, Beatriz. Sweetie, don't be mad. Tell me what you want to make you happy. - No, Father. I'm not mad. - Yes you are. I know. But you're good and soon you'll be happy. Utopia, pass me the platter. I told you I don't want you touching him! Father! Father, no! Gabriel, stop it! I'm locking you up. This time you won't even have water! You saw it! He hit me! Did you see? He hit me! It's your fault too. You won't get off the hook this time. You're going to die! Utopia! Let him out. - A rat can drown. - No. They can swim. - Really? - Of course. All animals can swim. Come. Utopia. Utopia! Yes, I'm coming. I'm just as scared as you are. I don't understand. I don't know what to do. But we must be patient. It'll pass. We've always been so happy. I don't understand. He's never been like this. He's gone mad. He's gone mad. He's mean. No, he's not mean. He's very good. He loves you very much. I don't love him anymore. Know people. Listen to this. The Detroit, Michigan Zoo had to hire 4 more guards... ...to protect the animals from the visitors attacks. The cruelty bragged by the zoo's assistants... ...often causes these animal's deaths. A kangaroo cub was beaten to death. A duck was speared with an arrow. The hippopotamus, expecting its cub... ...was thrown a rubber ball and it choked. They threw poisoned meat in the eagle's cage. - The zoo's employees... - Father? - Don't interrupt. - May I go to the bathroom? - You have your hours. - It's something else. Go. The zoo's employees... ...don't know how to stop this. Careful, careful. Don't kill them. They won't die. They can swim. - Let me wet them. - No, I am. - Let me! - No, Voluntad. With your hair like that you look like a lady. You look really pretty. - My eyes hurt. - It must be the dust. - I didn't sleep well. - How come? - I'm really scared. - Why? What's wrong? I can't tell you. You've always told me everything. - I told on Father. - What? I told on him with the police. What are you saying? I sent a letter to the police telling on him. To the police? I told them he was going to kill us. Honey, why did you do that? Because I'm scared, Mother! Don't be scared. It'll be all right. Look how happy we are. You have me. I'll protect you. You mustn't be scared. The police. What have you done? Utopia? What's wrong? - What is it? - She doesn't feel well. You too? What's wrong, Beatriz? Tell me, please. What's wrong? I don't know. How are you, Miss? Nice to see you. My mother isn't here. It doesn't matter. I'll leave the product. She can pay me later. - Are you Gabriel Lima? - Yes. Show me your license to sell this product. I don't have it on me. They never ask for it. - But you have it? - Naturally! I just leave it at home. If you wish to come with me, I'll show you. It's also been reported that it's a hazardous material. - It's banned. - I have a special permit. The director is a close friend of mine. Hey! What about the bags? I'll be right back. - Wait here. - We have to go with you. - I'm telling you to wait! - Don't yell at me, sir. Don't tell me what to do, especially in my house! You're in trouble. Idiots! You don't know what you are doing! Wait here. I'll go. The police! The letter was a lie! Please leave! I didn't want them locked up! I agreed so my children would be alright! - Please leave! - What are you talking about? He has us locked up and he has the key! - I didn't do anything! - Get out of my house! If you touch me, I'll kill him! - Let him go! - Come here! Please! Open the door! Let me out! Please! Go inside. Get out or I'll kill my entire family! - Get out! - Call for backup. Get out! This is my house! - Help! Let me out! - Get out! Hurry. Put the chair on top, Voluntad. Hurry up! Bring the lamp. Bring it now! Put it there. Get down, now! Wait here. Do nothing. He's insane. If you don't get out, I'll kill my family! You're insane! Don't be stupid! - Let him go! - Nobody is leaving! Go away! This is my house! I'm in here! Let me out! Please! Don't leave me here! Stay here! Stay here! Bring the extinguisher. Get me out of here! Please! I'm in here! Get me out of here! Don't move or they'll all die! I'm up here! Please, help me! Get out! Get out, please! Get out! Get out! No! Can't you see? Give it to me! Get out! Get out of my house! Get out! Get out, bastards! - Did you get my message? - Message? Get out of my house! Get out! Get out! - Get out! - No! - Get out! - No! No! No, Father! - Don't touch him! - No! Gabriel! Gabriel! Don't touch him! Mother! What's happening? I love you, Gabriel!
