Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. I AM A CAMERA Subtitles by Seglora My name is Christopher Isherwood. I'd like to think that I need say no more But perhaps I'd better add I'm a novelist comfortably off,set in my ways A confirmed bachelor Sentimental melodies have a profound and moving effect on me They seem to go to my stomach They make me feel that maybe I have missed something in life Unfortunately I can't always miss .the literary cocktail parties to which I'm invited by my publisher They always stage these things... when they are trying to promote the more dubious items on their list A gaggle of female journalists was in evidence from which I gathered Some ladies murky memoirs were being fostered on the public The more worthless the book... ...the more they need noise and alcohol to launch it. Higher though it is only civil on such occasions to know at least .. the name of the unfortunate author I could hardly believe my eyes Sally Bowles! "The lady goes on hoping" by SALLY BOWLES It's impossible What? Do you know her? I knew her my boy,if anyone ever knew her It is quite a story And you needn't lick your lips A story in which nothing happened and yet everything happened To me even more than to her I was struggling with my first book and losing every round I was broke,my only asset was the knowledge of German So I went to Berlin It was 1931 New Year's Eve in fact Money was short..... ...the book was getting nowhere... ...so I stayed at home and stared out of the window Sign of celebration were few and far from glamorous Berlin in those days was the dreary hopeless place The Nazis not yet in power.. ...were hanging about street corners... ...making themselves unpleasant I was a foreigner What could I do? I knew in my heart at heart that I was ducking the issue But I took refuge in a very convenient phrase I said eye to myself: "I am a camera". Good title "I am a camera". Herr Isherwood. -Hello, Fritz. - Hello. -What did you say? -I said I am a camera. A camera? With its shutter open Just watching it,quite detached Taking pictures of it all to be developed sooner or later and printed Now sit down here in big chair -You will feel better then. - Mrs Schneider... ...I didn't mean I am a camera,I meant I'm like one. Now I understand. You mean writing is photograph,ja? -Yes - It would be good if.. ...look after yourself a little more and eat a little more... ...not to work so hard all time. All day he lies down to think. All night I hear him walking up and down,up and down Now if he would find himself a nice young lady... ...he wouldn't walk up and down so much - You and your young ladies -You go and get Herr Wendel some beer - All right I didn't expect you tonight,you old gigolo I thought you were going out dancing with that what's her name,the little widow? That's a little question The say she's got 300 000 marks,yes... ...but she also weights 160 pounds I fear I shall never marry The fortunes get smaller and the ladies get larger all the time The inflation Perhaps I'm too much an idealist I telephoned Gerda tonight I was badly ill and cannot not dance... ...but she would not believe me But this I find ultimately insulting -So what are you up to now? - First and foremost my dear friend ...to take you out tonight. Also you should not sit and brood over your "verdammte" manuscript -Will you come? - Where? Something very interesting I promise you Well my friend..... ...yesterday at this party I met a young lady Now look if you think you are going to to involve me... Zwei bier, bitte. English my boy So fresh so innocence... ...but underneath one could sense full of enthusiasm and possibilities Her mother she told me where French you know,what that means. I know what it means, but she, I think,does not yet know. And now ladies and gentlemen our new star,the famous English -Is that her? -Yes Fraulein. Sally Bowles! I saw him in a caf? in Berl?n. Well? And saw the place where love affairs begins The lilac convey The world was young then A ukulele sounded gaily within I only saw the lamplight on his head He only picked his hat up from a chair A minute later ...he paid the waiter. -Good,uh? - And when I dare to... ...look again, he wasn't there. One night was dark..... What do you think? She's got talent Personality -I don't know ...but I remember thinking him... ...the finest man I seen. Never ask where I found for I cannot say ...but I know I love him now until my dying days He left a minute after I came in A funny way for lovers to begin I can't forget him... ...I never met him. I only saw him in a caf? in Berlin Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! Bravo, bravo! It seems to me sooner or later this lovely young girl will be seized ...lousy types here... - So what? So I say to myself it is going to happen anyway,why not me? Naturally I must marry sooner or later and then must live But I dance with Gerda I think later When I see this girl and get me the look of the eyes She said something of going to Paris soon Chris,I intend to go there too and live with her What on? In my idealistic mood I don't think of money She said something about a film contract Paris,my boy,Paris,with such a film star! If you going to live on what she makes as a film star I think you both better take sandwiches along Shut up! My dear Miss... ...allow my congratulations - Thanks Oh,yes,at Rudy's yesterday I remembered your eyes If they were asking me to look at you and yet not see you Allow me this is Mr Isherwood he is writing a very famous novel -Chris,Miss Sally Bowles. - How do you do -How do you do -You will join here,Miss? Thank you,I just adore it, but I off to Paris tonight Tonight! With two something train with Pierre -Pierre? -Yes,he is my fianc?e. He's wonderful,aren't you darling -So the lousy type got that first - You sneer at everything I must be losing my judgement, my sixth sense Perhaps I have better get married to Gerda while I can You see anyway I was too frank with her.. I didn't listen to Fritz's moan His innocent little English girl... ...seemed to be having trouble with her unpleasant fianc?e I observed it with the correct camera like detachment But I couldn't help feeling sorry for her all the same -Please -Don't argue.Give me the money. Come on,you won't wait forever Skol Give me the money I said! -Don't you trust me? -Darling. Now listen . Do you want trouble? All right...All right All right. Darling! Darling! You will come back? That's an interesting situation To me no more Lets go and talk to her If you'll excuse me I think I'll go ultimately to Gerda Maybe at home,lonely,worrying about me After all I have got a heart -May I? -Do But at least till Pierre comes back He is terribly jealous,you know At least I think he is Poor little thing,trying so hard to appear sophisticated Naive as a school girl trustful as a child ...defenseless in the night world of Berlin She had changed her clothes for the train The hour came and passed She bravely tried to pretend the man would still come back for her At last I had to say it He won't come. I suppose he won't Shall I see you home? Well... Only to the front door Which way? Just any way I mean I thought I was going to Paris so I gave up my room Well I suppose we'd better find you a hotel. Well,yes but... You see,Pierre took all my money To turn it into a terrific lot of Francs on the black exchange he said The trouble is I almost none left my self Well there is only one thing for it, you'd better come home with me Well,all right There is an empty room at my place, in fact I'm moving it in tomorrow -There it is -Oh,so I said Yes? Awfully nice to put me up, you see tonight... ...when Pierre didn't come back I made an absolute vow,never You needn't be afraid of me There is no room for that sort of thing in my life you see I've work to do,very important work Must he? I'm sorry the other room is locked The land lady is always locking everything up all the time But you can have the bed over there,I'll sleep here on the sofa Is this your bed? Perfectly pure This is rather like somebody or other's isn't it? You know I rather like this room You can take it if you like, as I said,I'm giving it up That'll be fine This is rather mouldy and sinister,isn't it? Just right for me if I'm going to be sort of a nun I'm moving across the passage so I can keep an eye on you You mean because of men like Pierre? I admit I do fall for them rather Pierre is such a thrill When he walked up When was it? Was it Wednesday,two three nights ago Walked so divinely sinister But you said he was your fianc?e! He was more of a faun really Last night he made me feel as I was some marvellous kind of nymph ...miles away from anywhere in the middle of the forest Then the landlady came in and made the most boring remarks I may not be absolutely exactly what some people call a virgin. ...that's no reason for her to call me was she called me,is it? So what if Pierre did happen to be there? Any way I meant to be terribly faithful to him That's pretty well makes him my fianc?e,doesn't it? I suppose it is a point of resemblance Well,we just go to bed or do we have a drink first? I've got a pupil in the morning, I give English lessons I think we better go to bed All right You can undress in there,behind the curtain I bet you're afraid of me Of course I did make a vow Now look here Sally -Yes -If you're going to live here... Well,we'll talk about it in the morning Good Night,Chris Good Night, Sally Good Night Good Night I wondered what on earth I let myself in for I thought of my quiet life and my program of work "Well", I thought, "I can deal with all this in the morning". Mr. Isherwood! Mr. Isherwood! Mr. Isherwood,half eleven. ...and Fraulein Landauer will be here half past for her lesson It's time to wake up lazy boor Oh..what Where is Herr Isherwood? Here I am Fraulein Schneider But Herr Isherwood when I said ...a young lady - I've been most divinely chaste Chaste? This much I see Now look here, Schneiderchen, to be chaste is to be pure ...to be virgin. - Chaste maybe,Herr Isherwood.. ...but when you are caught.. - Look here,Fraulein Schneider... ...this is Miss Bowles a very respectable young English lady -Practically a nun. You see I made a vow - She wanted a room exactly like this one ...so I brought her here - I wouldn't be bad as a lodger -I'm awfully quiet -Quiet ? Yes, not a sound did I hear So light,so slim Should I be chased,so help me God,the neighbours below.. ...they would go bang bang on the ceiling I bet you've been chased all over the place in your time When Fraulein Landauer come here Isherwood ...what shall I do? - God,I've forgotten! Sally, get some clothes on as quickly as you can -Is the little room open? -Already I cleaned it Good,I'm washing,Sally have it please The Fraulein studying in Berlin or perhaps a profession? Well, I was a future film star A film star! But present I'm singing in a night club -At least I was - So Herr Isherwood have told Fraulein that this room with breakfast is fifty marks? I think it is an absolute dream -Sally! -Coming No! Which I slipped a bit Not dressed? But I asked you to get dressed -But darling,I had to do my nails -Get that off No,no,put something on -Darling I can't! -Get in there -Draw the curtains -So! Fraulein Schneider she says you should give English lessons. "Here is the foot and here is the knee" Ha,ha. Stop all this nonsense and let Sally get dressed My pupil will be here any minute a very proper innocent young girl If you turn your back a minute I have a pain in my back,dear Miss, with all this that got behind it He is jealous,he had his eye on you last night Chris! Don't worry were just like two little white rabbits something When I was young,dear Miss, I also kept those pets Now listen,Fritz,it's nothing between Sally and me! Strange but true Well,in that case,dear Miss Yes she is now! My pupil,my only pupil. Sally,get something on quick! Fritz, help me,stop her! Guten Morgen,Frohe Neu Jahre, schoenes Wetter haben -Hello Chris! -Good Morning,Natalia -I'm not too late? Have I kept you waiting? -No,no.Not a bit I come to say to you unfortunately I cannot have my lesson today. -Do you mind? -Not in the very least,I assure you May I present Fritz Wendel? -Miss Natalia Landauer. -How do you do But we stand here in the hall? I have eight minutes Chris, I wish you a Happy New Year I hope it will calm and peaceful I hope so too I mean I hope you continue to take your lesson But certainly,yes Only today there is a great meeting on the unemployment.. ...to get help for poor people who have no work This winter there are many who do not have clothes to cover them -Yes,I know -And I am one of them! One of the unemployed I mean,they'll never take me back to Windermere. I mean they got so petty last night because I told them I was leaving... ..without giving them a year of notice Can't find my shoes This is Miss Sally Bowles Miss Natalia Landauer. -How do you do -How do you do -You have been taking lessons? -No, I'm English -I just dropped in -Dear Miss,your shoe Thank you Thank you for lunch,Schneider, here on the table,please You permit that I get you a little coffee? -How do you take it?? -Black I too,black like Othello Will you have a little roll,dear Miss? Thanks I'm dying for breakfast Natalia,is your father better? From his cold,yes.But now he has much trouble with the store The Nazis now start to campaign that all department stores ...are owned by Jews - Landauer? -It is a very bad thing. But they have the most beautiful store in all Berlin -Coffee my dear? -Thank you -Please sugar for your coffee -No,no,I never take it I could make a compliment,that you are sweet enough already ...that would be old happening. . -And scientifically not kind -You like science,I too Well if I did make a vow Unmarried people stay always young -Like you -Thank you Come on Fritz I'll make you a prairie oyster it will do you all the good in the world I saw some eggs over here and Worcester sauce You often feel paralysed and dead. after a terrific and insane sort of a night absolutely nothing in the world . good for you as a prairie oyster I think we live on them I think Sally rather likes to chock people Chris,it's obvious an evil thing to say Why do say that I am out to shock people? Why do you paint your finger nails green for example? To attract men,that's why You know to feel their eyes.. ...running up like mice. What absolutely foolish rubbish No,that is good to attract men A girl when she is healthy that is what she most wishes,no? And I will tell you,if you will not be shocked ...if I were in love with a man,really in love... and we couldn't get married, I would not hesitate to live with him, By me it is good to meet a young lady who is strong and free ...and above these conventions... ...which are in these days gaga -I'll make you an oyster -Thank you Despise conventions,dear Miss,I too Look here Natalia, I hope you don't think that Sally and I Yes,because of this Really, Schneider, leaving her... Chris! Schneider! Good! -I hope we meet again,Miss Bowles -I hope must go to the unemployment meeting Dear Miss,may I come with you? Fritz darling Would you take me to the Windermere? I left my bag there I'd better collect it I am most sorry,this meeting for the unemployed ,it is a duty May I have the pleasure? If you are really going,yes Good Bye, Chris. You are interested in social problems,dear Miss,I too I must say I think he is a rather bogus character. I suppose he is in a way,perhaps as he rather fancy himself as a gigolo But I don't know there is something rather sad about Fritz He'll be quite a bit sadder if he thinks he is going to make a hit with that girl ...I told him this. She'll never fall for that I'll be off I think Should I'd better get my things cleared up. -Bye Chris. -Bye, Sally. Sally certainly seemed to grow on people,but I was determined she wasn't to interfere with my work And I made up my mind to tell her so in no uncertain term -Back again? -Yes I'm just finishing -What did they say at the Windermere? -There was nobody there but the doorman I say You don't absolutely hate me throwing you out of your room like this Poor mangy old thing -Me? -No, this -Cripes Is this your hairbrush? -I've been meaning to wash it -You're losing your hair? -I don't know,do you think so? You tell me you take all those! Only when I need them What are there?Things to restore your strength or something? No,just vitamins and things. Do you want some? No thanks,I've rather too much vitality already Me in my innocent youth. Where is the other? My very best pair,Kurt brought me those I scarcely worn them That old pig will never give me the other one if I left it in my old room Glad I took a few towels Knew it would serve the right for something or other,half a 60 marks pair I hope it hit somebody No.It is lying there looking rather,you know There is a little boy,he is just pouncing on He is running around corner with it Perhaps he has got a one legged sister Are you really writing the famous novel? Well.I'm sort of working on the general idea It's hard work,I can tell you Which reminds me, ever since last night I've been meaning to tell you I tell you lots of thin to put in it You know secrets of of a woman's life Moments of passion Yes I expect you can, but no cry as I was about to say Christ There's my shoe -Sally I'm trying to tell you something -This time it did hit somebody Chris... ...I'm awfully glad we are going to be friends I don't think I ever had a real friend before One or two girls maybe. Girls are like feminine Can you cook? Eggs and things Have you ever read "Trilby"? I would be rather like that I'll get jobs and become a terrific well known night club singer Maybe a film star! In between I inspire you and we'll have meals together Bet you wear belts as well as braces -Mentally maybe I do -I wish I could be a pupil for you. But I couldn't pay you until I got a job And of course I speak English already. But I'll darn your socks and things and cook for you ...and wash up and do the cleaning Sally was going to be the little house wife She spent her time going around agents Whatever she may have got from them,it certainly was not the job Pupils were scarcer than ever The rent was unpaid And Schneider no longer cleaned up for us As for my famous novel The less said about that the better Before long I was forced to pay a visit to my brokers ...to negotiate a loan I was mortified to find... ..that cameras was not highly rated in the financial circles of the Hauptstrasse I find so -Chris! -Hello, Chris. -Hello -Hello, Fritz. Hello, Natalia. -Hello! -How is the work,Chris? -Not so bad -Writing hard? It goes well enough.. Fine. As Mr Landauer was saying to me the other day -...to work is good. -But my lieber Fritz... ...it was not of Chris he said that. How is Sally? She is always out when I come Well,she is looking for a job,you know We put a note on the door This week and next I can no more take my lessons You see my father send us to the mountains I've been invited for the week end At least I'll go and stay at the inn Well,that'll be all right,of course -Good Bye, Chris. -Bye, Chris. Komm fort schnell we'll be late I don't know,other people seemed to be having fun ..but I reminded myself that it wasn't my business to have fun I had to get back to my little room and my work I began to feel that my program was a lot of rot That everything I ever written was spiritedly ...cold and dead That I never should be a writer. Hello,are you asleep? -No. -I thought you might be working -I just washed my hair -You are always washing your hair Food is ready what there is of it Agent have anything? He said maybe next week He took me out for a drink afterwards that's why I was late Somehow,however,he got the impression.. ...that today was my birthday -Not with it -Yes with Is it the writing? You see I put down what I do, I put down what they say Lord knows,they are all terribly unhappy It adds up to nothing Why not have someone leave them a terrific lot of money? Talk of something you understand A most strictly understanding let a terrific lot of money I thought about it a great deal Many books were people are left with lot of money where actually fine. They are not even people I've read over what I had done They seem to have no faces,nothing Well if you put in,say,that a girl got violet eyes with some sort of beautiful sensuous mouth -That's a face,isn't it? -No. -Or if a man got terrific.. -Don't be stupid. No faces? Well,bottoms up,I say What's the good to trying to explain? What's the good of trying to write? What's the good of anything? Oh, Chris... It'll get better You write a book and it will be terribly good Everybody knows that you are a genius Yes.I told them so myself -No -What then No! A puritan all of a sudden If you like Just where I'm concerned You're the puritan You hate me,Chris.That's why it was ugly We don't be able to talk to each other again I know that I talk like a fool very often But... All right, Sally. I'll go to bed Chris... It'll get better After this horrible winter we all feel different Truly Sally was right. Spring came at last. And all the starved capped in the neighbourhood,ourselves included ...began to feel life was worth living The bookshops blossomed with new editions Unfortunately all by other authors We were still as hard up as ever ...but we could have drifted along quite happily... ...but for that memorable day which began ...with a visit to the Landauer. mothballs and old England Respectable enough? Then my fox you see I haven't the necklace They'll see my fox Perhaps I should brush it with some hairs on it -Oh,make up your mind,it's getting late. -I am ready. I bet they give us a terrific lunch. Now over your sudden glum Well it's no that.It's. ...it's that I may have contracted a rather fatal disease Why do you always choose a day when we are going somewhere? What is for heavens sent Locomotor ataxia -What? -It's a form of paralysis. Look here It's pretty final Let me try Well,it's probably just a bit of house maid's knee Good Morning ,my humble friends -Are you ready? -Almost -Chris got a touch of locomotor -What Locomotor ataxia.Look here You? Impossible. Let me... See? You are hitting high up. You will live I think Extraordinary Come along.I've been out here and ready ...Natalia's parents has lent me a car to pick you up Do you mean to say that let you drive their car? Why not? But this one happens to be the limousine so ultimately the chauffeur drives Well,if we are going to be driven by a chauffeur I am going to wear my hat Penniless people should avoid contact with the rich Already poor Fritz was acting like a son in law Though we all knew he was getting nowhere with Natalia As for Sally... ...it might have been the chauffeur... ...it might have been the car... ...but something transformed her. She looked at the Landauer house. ...as she had not seen glass or concrete before Or flowers,or silver or servants It all went to her head like wine So did the wine. By the afternoon she was treading on air -That is stirring -You remember the Charleston? Perfectly. Fritz,get the record, it's on the left side,please Chris. I just adore old fashioned dancing Chris... If you were rich would you buy me a fur coat? No. You know sometimes I think Chris has no heart at all I wish I had none Poor old Fritz you've got it badly,haven't you? You know? It's for money Sally, I tell you it isn't. I swear to you I don't see you after it any longer besides this ...prevents you treating her like other girls You have to admit you are a bit respectful To Natalia,how not? Vowing is not going to do you any good If I were a girl like Natalia ...I'd be rather impressed by a pounce A pounce? Well,you know. It is impossible How can anyone pounce on Natalia? Anybody can pounce on anybody and generally they do -This was funny music -You've splendid, Natalia. -Another record? -It's after five.. ..we have to fly - Oh, no. You do not stay for the evening? It's going to be a party, more people are coming. We'd love to.. we'd got a friend and he is feeling awfully bad. I'm so sorry.. ...but my mother and father went out in the car. That's all right,we'll take the train. Well,it's a great pity but if you must We left Fritz to his fate ..and caught up with our own only too quickly. Step by step as we made our way home ...Sally's fever was mounting Look! Diamonds! -Oh, Chris,I feel such a hunger. -Want a sausage? -I mean a spiritual hunger -Come on I've serious thought of becoming a femme fatale You know the kind of bankers, princes,and people fall in love. ...and absolutely ruin themselves. - First catch your prince If I could hire a horse and go riding in the Tiergarten ...and it could run away with me and all of a sudden dashing.. All right Never get married, Chris. That is the sort of man who kills the soul of a woman ...who bring her down to earth.. ..and you make it to desert.. ...or horrible dead and dry. Look at this old thing Chris, I'm so thirsty it's all your fault When we get back to Hauptstarsse I'll buy you a beer Beer! The sort of thirst you don't know anything about. Chris! I need a champagne cocktail I've been in a limousine in a wonderful house Chris, if only you could understand... I know you got money 70 marks is for our rent tomorrow -I've been guarding them for days -I know -What will Frau Schneider say? -Look Three marks each for the drink and one for the tip that's only seven marks Give it a rest it will keep her quiet come on It's all very well for bankers and princes ...but I can't afford to be ruined Well,just one you understand I'm sure you would appreciate the service here We have the best cocktails in Berlin,what do you want? Champagne cocktails Which type of champagne,Madam? Pure champagne of course. I suppose I didn't ask for a drop of absinthe in it I suppose you have been done for better not. Anyway I think you are rather intimidated by a place like this To me it seems the most natural thing in the world More than Frau Schneiders lousy dump anyway ...where I expect every single night to be simply crawled on by bedbugs Chris,why don't we be able to go to the races every day in the spring -...unles we do a lot of sailing. -Thanks You do look like an utter fool like grinning like that The trouble with you Chris is that you are probably the most insensitive man I ever met One thing you don't understand women I hate to say this,Chris but I don't think you are a real writer and I don't think really you have a talent Chris! I drunk it all up and I didn't really noticed Dear,have mine Encores de champagne cocktails I have to admit the service is awfully good here,I like that I'd like to come to this place often Chris, you do look so glum Well,it we going to spend a bit of the rent money on champagne we might as well enjoy it Here is to poor old Schneider Chris, I'm feeling so much better Caviare pour Madam? Well,yes Oui Merci. Beluga or Astrakhan caviare,Madam? Some of the big ones,la grande La! Sally! -Pour Vous Monsieur? -Thank you no. I realize I was so hungry Nor did I Have ever Madame tried the Caspian caviare? Practically jamais. Just a little. Chris, got to try it Only a bit salty it makes me thirsty. Encore un cocktail de champagne This servuga caviare has almost no salt at all. I think I should like that,oui Sally! Sally! Darling, have you got a cigarette? Cigarette Look, Chris! Yellowish cigarette with tubes Oh,it's lovely I got to have this bear I feel so Russian tonight Five marks for cigarette,Monsieur and 20 marks for the bear Spasiba Sally,you have gone absolutely stark staring raving mad Enjoy,you can't keep counting pennies all the time I think I must have a good deal Russian blood in me My grand mother was Russian She escaped from Russia in the middle of the winter on a sledge Pursued by wolves and she threw a serf to them Only 45 marks left and the bill is going to cost hundreds -For 5 champagne cocktails... -And the caviare I thought that was free,I mean with the drinks like peanuts -Chris,what will they do to you -We should probably end up in jail. No,lets have another drink and talk it over -No,no -Encore un champagne cocktail,Madame -Oui. Now look here Sally there is only one thing to do You finish this course and drink just water and walk out I'll stay and talk with him Oh, Chris,you would only make an awful mess. Merci -I could do it better. -Oh,shut up That's not very nice, I'm trying to be helpful Any mess you get into,you are trying to get out by using ...your extremely inadequate sex appeal My sex appeal is adequate? It's adequate Inadequate Adequate... Chris, you are so upset you wouldn't say a thing like that One Martini. There is always a way out, Chris. Lady,how do you like to tilt that glass a little bit further? I'm sorry really Don't worry I like the flavour In that case please I never say no to a drink but the next one is on me We couldn't think of it unless you insist I'm coming up just to do that -Sally! -Chris,stop being an idiot Say,hello. Mortimer is the name,Clive Mortimer This is my brother Mr Isherwood,the Mr Isherwood -My name Sally Bowles -Glad to know you,Mrs Bowles. Miss But he is your brother? Adopted,just adopted Just adopted,as a matter of fact If you find it confusing his name is Chris and mine is Sally Chris, old boy,I wanna tell you right now you got a mighty pretty sister -Hey,what do you care for drinking? -We call them "same again" The best drink in the world Hi,come,let's have the same again all around Encore trois champagne cocktails Chris, Sally, I got an idea A fellow was telling me that for dinner and a floor show there is ...nothing like the Alhambra Palace Garden. -Know anything about the joint? -Yes -What? -We can't afford to go there That sounds good! -Is it the pops,the real pops? -Oh,definitely -Can we have a real good time there? I simply adore The Alhambra wherever it is That's where we are going tonight,kids The Alhambra Palace Gardens Hi,come,let's have the cheque, but the cheque is on me! And afterwards the Femina Hello,and eldorado! And now to the Resi. And now to bed Hey! You are a great guy,Chris a real great guy But Sally... Some people would have called it an ordinary hang over But I was furious of Sally and felt I was on the brink of the grave Sally had brought me to this, I could hardly wait for her return ...to tell her that our relationship was finished But low be hope but she blew in bubbling with life ...and had the impudence to imply that I was jealous I do think people are so ridiculous about love Why shouldn't they take it as a part of the spring? You know lambs hopping cocks popping and all that sort of thing What are you doing in bed? Darling Are you really ill? Oh,Chris Is it because I..? Leave me in peace Chris,I wouldn't dream of doing such a thing Clive! Ya,baby!What is it? Come up quickly! It's Chris he's got What? -Rheumatic fever,I think. -Rheumatic fever Chris, I feel terrible -So do I You might be crippled for life -Oh,Chris could I rub you? -Oh,no Where is he? Show me the old horse! Who says he is sick? -I do -Brother,you ought to know You don't look so good Rheumatic fever... Oh,look,kids, this is not a sort of doublet,let's him get him around in a hotel There is another bedroom in the suite on the other side of the living room We'll get him there,stick him in the back of the car Covering him up and get him down come on honey give us a hand will you -Give us a shot. -Leave me alone I don't think we should add any more hot water bottles,Clive No? I think we really should have ice bags to prevent the fluid mounting to the brain. What fluid? It is nothing,darling This is a silly old book You see when it gets there I read about a scientific doctor ...put a guy's brain right out and put in a chimp's brain No time at all he was up around and carrying some blonde up a tree. But Chris wants to write a book He had his chance in bed,won't he? Look,once he turned the corner... They say champagne is awfully good for sick people That's my apartment,sister I told them as I came in Fine, fellows, put it down Clive, darling,perhaps we should have some brandy to dampen his heart This guy is going to get Napoleon Brandy. Clive, you are wonderful It will give you the will to live, won't it darling? It didn't do much for Napoleon -Hello -Guten Tag. -Guten Tag -Guten Tag, Herr doctor. Here is your patient We thought it was first rheumatic fever But now we are rather inclined to fear meningitis Perhaps I better make the examination Guten Tag Don't you think he seems rather cold and brutal? I told them to get the best doctor in all Berlin -But what is he going to do to him? -He'll give him the works,honey. When these Germans examine the guy, they examine him... ... penthouse to basement Do you see what I mean? I hope he makes him well and then we should take him for a drive in Tiergarten Hire a wheel chair, if you like,baby and we'll take him around the night spots Clive... Don't you think we should let people know? Just a few close friends I mean Call them up get them around here I got to like to see these guys No alcohol, a light supper a good night sleep... ...and tomorrow morning you'll be perfectly well Guten Tag "An idiot", I decided, "but at least a harmless one". What followed was an absolute night mare Guten Tag Clive and Sally were not satisfied in turning the place into.. ...into a night club. The day one into a hospital as well. Did your doctor examine your sympathetic nervous system? -Of course he did,ulcers? -Or hardening of the arteries Or softening of the brain I'm going to get this fellow to work on your spine Sally!Come here! Look at this.What does it say? "Disorders of the blood,brain,nerves.. ...skin, lungs and bowels. The water cure". Pretty well covers the field,yah unless the poor guy got bunions And look at this,a guy with sparks coming out of him Electrotherapy I'm going to get these,birds,I'm going to get them up here right away There What are you going to do? Oh, no! I'm perfectly all right! No,I mean! No! Sally, there are two people outside to see you Hello Fraulein,if you please, where is the bath room? There is one through there -For me is necessary two bath rooms -Well One bath very hot one bath very cold Because it is hydrotherapy In that case there is another one through there Thank you Please No, no...! Sally! Hey,that masseur,sure gives him a go Poor Chris! No, no, no! Fraulein,is there more ice cubs? Absolutely,anything you want Thank you Hello Oh,yeah,do come in, the patient is having a massage He says he needs a chair Clive,darling,the most divine and sinister little doctor do give him a drink No, please don't! Clive! Sally! Sally! Clive! No! Keep up the singing kids,or we have the manager in Sally, give him a guitar! Very good,girl. Sally! Sally, please! Clive! Ah, no! Clive, pleaser! Sally! Sally, Clive! Clive,all this is doing Chris so much good Clive,couldn't it be wonderful to spend the rest of our life helping sick people ...have a sort of a hospital - Yes,baby! I must need some medicine You are healing Couldn't be all right? Sally! Everything is going to be wonderful Darling,it will be all right,I promise you Absolutely wonderful Clive!Sally! You're all right,darling Sally! Absolutely fine! When I woke,feeling a new man.. ...I was rested,relaxed,my muscles toned up beyond belief I borrowed a pair of pants and went back home I was inspired my style seemed to have crackled with electricity No doubt I could have written a master piece.. ..but my dear friends turned up and dragged me out again Come on,let's get him out of here,quick Now and then I was ashamed about sponging ..but was Sally's childish enjoyment and her winning ways ...Clive being so warm giving and my own lack of system ...I was content to play along Until one afternoon that madness reached its climax And Clive insisted we should all go Honolulu and then places! Baby, we are off to Honolulu -Now look at these folders -No,there is a limit to everything Look pal,Tahit?. Where Cezanne cut his ear off? What's that? Some guy's funeral,they, they giving him a work Stressberg probably, it were in the papers today An old guy the Nazis bumped off? This is the time to get out off Look, Japan, Singapore... Is there a bar there The Long Bar they call it. But I can't travel with you and Sally. Chris,why not? It will be sheer absolute heaven Well for one thing I don't have any money. Don't worry about money,look India Some marvellous maharajah they offer my weight in diamonds ...to spend one night in his harem Egypt! Cruising down the Nile with the desert all around us and moonlight ...and those sinister sensual harem. ...watching us on the top of the pyramids Chris, pal come on... -Well I don't know. Good,that's a stop,that's what I like to hear Now listen you need some tropical kits I got to go to Paris for a couple of days but while I am gone get your assets,all you need. I'll be back Thursday we'll leave Friday Next stop, Honolulu! -We shall never come back,you know -Who wants to come back? I can see us ten years from now you married to Clive ...and I'll be a sort of private secretary A bit glassy in the eye a bit heavier around the jaw Not if you make plenty of exercise Here is your tropical kit, do try it on again Anyway you write your book in the next few months Would have been one of these round the world book They are always a success. They are shapeless bestsellers Tahit?, Honolulu...! Ten days that didn't shake the world I didn't know if people felt like this in the middle ages ...when they sold their souls to the devil Chris, you look marvellous You look absolutely irresistible You say the craziest things There is always a moment when it is not too late,Sally When you have your last chance ...and no one ever seems to take it Come in Hello, Fritz. -You are ultimately off then? -Yes they too,both going away My other room is empty.What am I to do? Schneider, darling,you get other tenants -They don't match after all -Other tenants? In these times when the banks close down. ...and the knackwurst is 1 mark and 50... And even the potatoes will get up everything goes wrong It is the Jews,believe me,are up to bring the country down You know that is absolutely rubbish You should listen to the radio,to the speeches,Herr Isherwood. But you don't care you're going away How are you, Fritz? Not good,not good at all Chris, not more of your things. We'll be here to Christmas How is Natalia? You remember the advice you gave me? I attempted but it put her against me She sent me a note that she will not see me,she will never see me again -You must have made an awful mess of it -Quite possible,but I love her Also she is worried about all the attacks on the Jews. It's not my fault that her father get threatening letters all the time From some lousy Nazi,I suppose Every day they get something, I tried to comfort her,she screamed at me ...her father is worried sick and her mother is falling down fainting ...and now will I go please,please So I go Maybe if you went back in a day or two? Chris... Can I tell you something? Sally too Yes of course Sally,these are yours. Telegram It is something so bad, so disgusting,I don't know how to -It can't be! -What is it? It's nothing Look, Fritz,we got terrible lot to do Oh,Sally, no Yes we have. Look,Fritz, I'm not trying to get rid of you Of course I understand Good Bye.Good Bye, Chris. -Fritz, wait a minute! -It doesn't matter,I go Sally, that was cruel.There is something wrong,Fritz is in trouble Yes and so are we.Real trouble Listen to this. "Sally dear: Sorry must postpone our jaunt. Crazy people here insist a trip up the Amazon Let's hope for next year or some time Love to both, Clive". -Well -Well... I mean it is an outrage.What does he think we are brushing us off like this? What we are suppose,something rather cheap. Don't start moralizing I'd wish I'd started sooner At least he could let us know before we spent all our money All whose money? All right,make yourself out as a saint, you can't do anything else Pretend you are glad of it! -Yes I am,I most certainly am! -We were well off before I suppose. Shut in this home not been able to go out to a caf? You moaning all the time and sucking my blood ...like some dreary clammy,vampire ...just because you have someone to talk to about arts You,your precious book,you can't even write ...just because you want to be known as the most wonderful writer in the world And along comes Clive and you're jealous of of him -You believe that! -Yes -Because he was a man -Not a very fastidious one What do you mean by that? I dare you to tell me what you mean by that I mean.When you're leaving this room You can take your things,take everything if you like and move out of here I will not stay here even if you begged me on your knees to be nagging -Preached by you -Good You can finish your packing I'm going out when I come back Don't worry,I'll be gone Hello, Fritz. -Not gone yet? -Not going. Everything is off Fritz,what was you trying to say? Nothing It didn't sound like nothing What is not said,what else can it sound like? Now,look Fritz... Better I keep it to myself A drink? No, thank you Fritz, I came to apologize,I've been It's not easy to say one is ashamed of one self No? Supposing you were a Jew? What do you mean? And had denied it,lied about it That's what I had to say That I was a cheat,a coward,a liar -Oh,come now, Fritz. -Now you know When did you start being that particular sort of idiot? Years ago.When I left school Thins that happened there? When I came to Berlin I thought: "No more of that". But I suppose of having given people the wrong impression ...you find it hard to take it back I did not want to take it back, I wanted to be smart, set and popular ...make a rich marriage Here in Germany even before Hitler. ...people made it miserable to be a Jew. They made it uncomfortable, you made it miserable Free English lessons All right,from now on I won't be miserable anymore Everyone shall know Have you told Natalia? It is because of her that I... I can no longer,I will no longer If she and her family are to be threatened by insults than I too Have you told her? She will have it Not from you? Let my face part in two? She already hates me,that's not enough? Do you think it would hurt her less if I went there?Told her myself? I told you I'm a coward Was,past tense,another free lesson When I left Fritz... ...it seemed I was back in real life again after a long crazy dream It's amazing how little of the world one can see ...from the back seat of someone's car They have destroyed everything I had.I have to leave everything But now I was walking... ...and on my own two feet And therefore must we Germans live since 1O years ...without dignity under the ignominy... ...beause of the Jewish subordinates... ...and parasites has sold us out!! The liberation is soon here Unser F?hrer... ...Adolf Hitler... ...has risen Germany wake up! We,the national socialists ...are Germans! When I now think of all that happened in the world since then ...that little scuffle seemed nothing to write home about But it got me out of my wretched protective shell Now with Sally off my neck ...I was ready to start a new chapter Herr Isherwood! Never would I thought it of him What's that? Herr Isherwood,it is not good to treat a young lady so,for this I'm ashamed of you No I'm going to make her some herbal tea to calm her -Is she still here? -Is she still here! What brutality! What evil! These men! These men What have you been saying to Schneider? I don't know Maybe she thinks that somehow your are the father. What? The father Chris, what's happened to you? -Oh,nothing Do you mean to say you're? I'm afraid so,I've been worried about if for quite a time Tried not to think about it just now I was ...I was going to the taxi I feel faint all of a sudden But this is serious You do sort of find the right word for things,darling,don't you? Haven't you better to lie down and rest? You are angry that I'm still here? Chris, I'm frightened I've made things up so much, never thought about anything Now it's here and real Don't worry,we'll see this through Clive? Well,haven't we better get in touch with him I mean you can always find him in person I know,actually he sent another telegram Telling me about some film friend of his in Paris Passing me on I suppose Chris, don't talk to me about Clive All the same. ...I think we ought to be very practically about having this baby Practically is just not having it I suppose so,still I don't like the idea I'm not exactly crazy about it, darling Would it help at all if I? ...if you were... ...if it was official if we got married? Chris... Now,I'll marry you if it will do any good,it needn't be Chris, I'll never forget you saying never There is a limit even for me Here,dear Fraulein, some good herb tea Fraulein Schneider,there has been a lot of misunderstanding ...about Fraulein Sally leaving about her little trouble ...and about the man responsible for all this. He's left the country and I never want to see him again What? Then indeed Herr Isherwood, I'm sorry,I misunderstood So no marriage... That is sad Then for a young lady in such misfortune there is nothing but Frau Pitzberger Who? Is she a doctor? Herr Isherwood,she is everything If you have a wart,heavens forbid or a carbuncle ...she charmed it away If you wish a young lady to fall in love with you she will give you to put into her coffee If you wish your fortune -Where does she live? -No, that sort of thing will never do. Fraulein, Sally must have the best attention the best possible Naturally, but Herr Isherwood, that needs much money We can sell all the stuff, we'll get something for it Not much,darling,we tried everything on so much ...there is some egg on the n?glig? already Well if it isn't enough I can work I wrote about the subject nearest at hand ...what I'd seen and felt on that walk back from Fritz' place "Portrait of Berlin"I called it I went out and took it to the Berlin editor of an American magazine Sally! -I've been waiting and waiting for you to come in This is good Good.It's wonderful what do you think? They are going to be married Really? Natalia's father is going to Switzerland and Fritz is going ,he's going to be -Sort of a partner -Not the business partner... ...there is other work to do Natalia is going to have millions of the most divine babies I'm so glad Does make oneself old fashioned Chris,you wouldn't believe it,when I told her - Didn't spit in your eye? - She knew it all the time. We must go.There is much to do -Are you going for good? -I do not know But I must believe that the German people one day will understand ...what these Nazis are And then you come back? Perhaps.But you write to us and visit us if you can,both of you -Good Bye, Natalia. -Good Bye, Chris. -Good Bye, Natalia.Good luck - Good Bye, Sally. -Good Bye, Sally. -Good Bye, Fritz. Must say my advice turned out rather well Anyway it takes the shine of my little triumph All the same,he read it,he liked it , he paid for it,cash on the barrel head Chris,I think you're wonderful! And what we got for the clothes and things it will pay for everything I called the place you can go right away,they see you this afternoon. And by tomorrow maybe it will be all over -Well,I suppose I.... -What? I suppose I'd better change and get a tooth brush or something Nervous? Well,tell me what happened, what did the editor say? Well,he seemed an awfully nice sort of chap And he said he is going to turn it out with lots of photographs. Yes he wants to see me again this afternoon Why? He didn't say except I suppose he wants to make some changes or something -Chris, you mustn't come up. -Why not? You should go back to that editor But I can't let you go to that place all alone Nonsense,Chris,look,he may be testing you,see if you are keen. He may be offering you a terrific job Maybe going to retire and looking for a real young man to take his place Please, Chris. Well,all right And look,darling,there is something to tell you You are sending me some marvellous bunch of flowers ...and write to me actually throbbing on the card... ...and show it to the nurses so they won't think I'm... Well,you know Good Luck, darling CURTIS B. RYLAND Berlin Editor When I got back to the editor he had marvellous news for me ...and a breathtaking question -Now,can you leave tomorrow? -I... -You are a free agent. -Well... -No wife no family.. -No Fine Listen,I'm in a rush,we'll talk in the car I'll drop you off near your home I get the idea "A portrait of Madrid", " A portrait of Stockholm" A copy for you,and if I don't see you tomorrow,Good Luck Thank you -Watch that deadline -Right 250 dollars and all expenses paid I was ready to go I felt quite a pang of leaving Sally ...but I knew she was in good hands and well looked after Sally! Chris, darling,I changed my mind I think I began to when Natalia was here ...talking about the millions of marvellous babies she was going to have. Then Chris I went away from that dreadful place,there was a traffic jam And the taxi stopped in front of the most wonderful shop in the world ...all for little children Full of cradles,bottles ...little clothes,little shoes Yes,but... I thought that if you were so terrible decent to say we could get married I said what? Chris. You are quite right,I absolutely did. Oh Dear Darling,I knew you wouldn't let me down so I went in a bought a few things When I came out I saw a policeman who held up the traffic.. ...Chris don't scoff at me,but he seemed to me to have the face of an angel If I ever find him he would have Everything is going to be absolutely perfect! The only topic I can't find is really ideally name The whole list in the encyclopedia Aaron Isherwood, Abel Isherwood... ...Anthony Isherwood... Anthony is not bad but not for first -Also Athelstane Isherwood... -What did you say? "Athelstane",darling,that's sort of name would have an awful effect ...on a person's love life, don't you think? No,before that above Anthony. Not for the first I said then of course it my be a girl In that case it could be Ada Isherwood, Adeline... Why do you look like that,darling? You don't want it to be an only child,do you? There were complexes now the children must be sound ...in mind and body, that's remind me my milk What are you doing? Daddy is going to have a drink too Alcohol is rightly called treacherous The bottle I took to bed with me nothing reminded me of other bottles The bed seemed to rock like a confounded crib If I dozed for a moment I had visions of a boy like Clive. ...followed by a string of girls all exactly like Sally I don't think my health has ever completely recovered from the agony of that night. -Sleep well,darling? -No Here is our coffee I made it good and strong Coffee but I thought you were drinking milk Milk is all right,personally I think a dash of absinthe would improve it This morning is coffee -About Theodor... -Theodor Isherwood, the name I choose last night while you were out. I'd forget what I would say about it Darling,there is something I have to tell you. Sally, please don't tell me anymore. Not today,possible not at all -Darling,it could change your plans -They are very much changed already We could change them back again You see darling,I was never much good at arithmetic Sally,do you mean? I mean that people who are strange and extraordinary ...terrific sort of personalities... ...are usually rather above being good at figures and all that I could never understand dates Yes,Sally,but Theodor, tell me please? Is he? He isn't.I suppose in a way he never really was He was a mistake? I don't think it is very nice to call him that,behind his back I mean Sally, sit down,relax I'll get the rest of the breakfast I can see tell by the way you talk you are not thinking of marriage any more You never really wanted to marry me, Chris. I'm suppose I'm not the marrying kind -The taxi is here,Fraulein -This coffer here,please You're leaving? For Paris, of course. Chris, you forget everything I told you about that friend of Clive he make such terrific films Clive said in the telegram that he told him all about me. ...and was longing to meet me -You know what that means? -Yes I'm afraid I do Well then... Darling! Don't come down I take my last look at you in the room here Chris... -It has been fun -Hasn't it? You remember the very first day I was here? I'd said I would inspire you,you didn't quite believe me,did you,darling You did look like a dying fish But you see it all come true ,I mean You have really written something at last You wouldn't have except for me,inspiring,isn't it? Most likely in an unusual sort of way Nothing is quite usual,Chris. Life isn't like that You certainly aren't I should hope not , I mean having every sort of adventure ...be the most wonderful and fabulous personality You'll be a success too in a writer's sort of way Darling I must fly or I miss my train I almost wish I would Good Bye, Chris. Good Bye, Sally. -I'll send you a postcard - Do -I do love you.Good Bye -Good Bye,Sally Of course the promised post card never arrived And perhaps it was just as well Who knows I might got embroiled with her again Well I suppose I'd better go and say,how do you do I must admit... ...when I saw her name on the book I thought of a certain shudder... ...like someone walking over my grave -Grave of your youth --Youth... We can thank heaven on our bended knees we managed to reach years of discretion. Chris! -Sally! -How absolutely marvellous to see you I've been sitting surrounded by the most lascivious looking critics Have I changed? Not in the very least You have,you seem more mature,manly You were so absolutely unbelievable so repressed,darling ...in those days -You live in London? -Yes,I have a little house. How marvellous I mean I'm stuck here in a most dreary little furnished room What? With all this?Succesfull authoress? Yes,I get terrific royalties you know when? ...after the first 200000 copies have been sold Presently I have written my head off,you know Last night we had a little celebration in my place The landlady came in and said and made the most boring remarks So I had to leave. I suppose you'd better find your hotel To tell you the truth,darling, bankrupt,not a penny in the world There is only one thing for it you'd better come home with me. All right? There is a spare room in which I could Darling!You still a rather like a somebody or other aren't you? Good Bye everybody I was hoping to ask Darling you look marvellous in grey hair, you look absolutely irresistible Subtitles by Seglora Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
