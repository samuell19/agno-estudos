Not gonna change your grade. Here comes Mr. Toad. Latimer. What are you gonna do? You gonna fire me? Ask me to resign? What? Neither. We want to make you a principal. (SNICKERS) (CHUCKLES) Aw, come on, Frank. Don't you think your sense of humor's a little cruel? FRANK: Maybe, but this isn't a joke. You did in the past apply for an administration position, didn't you? Yeah, that was a long time ago. FRANK: I know it was. But we have a position that needs to be filled immediately and I feel you're the right person for it. A principal position? FRANK: A principal position. Where? Brandel. "Brandel"? Why am I not excited about it, Frank? You don't have the luxury to pick and choose, Rick. I got a school that needs a principal, and you need a job. I need an answer yesterday. Congratulations! You got the job. Thank you. (MUTTERING) Fuck you. Huh? Thank you. FRANK: You're welcome. (GAGS) (CAN OPENING AND POURING) (CLEARS THROAT) Good. (BARKS) (INAUDIBLE) Oh, God.

Okay, boys. STUDENT: Man, fuck you. What? I didn't hear that. That's his name, Fuck You. - Thank you. - Fuck you. Yeah. But you can just call me Fuck. Sweet. And call this ugly asshole White Zac. His name is too long to say. White Zac of Shit. (LAUGHING) Well, Mr. Shit... Can you tell me what class this is for? Any class Victor Duncan tries to kill me in. You shit! Get the fuck away from me! Sit. Like I said, we got all day. - Rick Latimer. - DARCY: The teacher from Willoughby. RICK: Right. I was hoping to speak with you before this... Oh, this wonderful, warm welcoming party? 'Sup! Hey, yo! Be the last time you say Victor's name. - Sit down, man. - Get the fuck off me, man! Sit down! Okay, why don't we start my first day off with some expulsion papers for Mr. Shit and Mr. Fuck? And, uh, call the police. Whoa, uh, hold your fire, Rick. Let's take our time here. Get up. Hi. Rick Latimer. I'm the new principal. No shit. I said, get up! RICK: Excuse me? Get up! Rick, uh, Latimer. I'm the... I'm the new principal. Oh, excuse me, Mr. Principal. Jake Phillips, head of security. Well, that's great. Uh, look, while you're here, why don't you call the police? And, Mr. Darcy, why don't you get the papers? Right on. Okay? Uh, Rick, I don't know if you got a good look at the neighborhood coming into this place. The high school isn't exactly the highest priority for the police around here. These guys just tried to cut each other's nuts off, for Christ's sake. The cops would only ask you why you stopped 'em. As far as expulsion goes, most of the students here have already been expelled from someplace else, permanently. Excuse me, Mr. Latimer? If you would like a tour of the resort, just whistle. Right. JAKE: Yep, they come from all over the district. Condit High, Crosby, El Roble. Burglary, weapons charges, truancy. All them nice things. (LAUGHS SHARPLY) They even come with their own customs and traditions. I see I'm not the only one from Willoughby. Oh, yeah, yeah. Tatawicz. He's from Willoughby. Part of that white gang that's tryin' to move in on Duncan's territory. Drug dealing, all that shit, you know? Victor Duncan? Yeah. I see you've met him. RICK: No, not directly. Here, follow me. Okay. BOY: Hey, boys, check it out! Bustante! BOY: Look what we got here. Check it out, eh? RICK: Oh, you must have a great dance department here. I like your clothes. RICK: Great move. I'm gonna have to learn that one, Jake. Sweet kid. Well, then, welcome to Brandel, Principal. Right. JAKE: Oh, and, uh... If you need me, you just whistle. (CHUCKLES) Hello? Oh. Ever vigilant, I see. Where we come from, they knock. Well, where I come from, they pick locks. So with your kind permission, Mr. Principal, I'd like to replace your old rusty one with a brand-new deadbolt. The kind only .357 Magnums can open up. Okay? Well, thanks, Jake. That's real encouraging. I feel much, much better. Have some jelly beans. Oh, thank you very much. Man, you mind if I ask you a question? I ask all imported principals. All right, sure. What is a fine, white-bred boy like you doing in a place like this? Keeping my warm ass planted in this chair. Right. Till something better comes along, right? RICK: Yeah, right. Right. Didn't know why I should think it would be anything different. (SIGHS) (BALL BOUNCES DISTANTLY) What's that? That's a scared kid. Duncan's crowd has been terrorizing him. Hold tight, Arturo. Be out in a minute. (BALL CONTINUES BOUNCING) RICK: What are you lookin' at? (BALL BOUNCING) (CLATTERING) Hi, Kimberly. Ricky, get the hell away from me. Just a minute, honey. Come on. A minute is all it takes for you to do unthinkable amounts of damage, Latimer. Oh, come on. Let's go out for a drink. - You know, let's talk. - Too late for that. It's not too late. Rick, I put up with all the frat brat, Peter Pan bullshit I can take. Hey, come on. That's your therapist talking. That's not you talking. Well, at least somebody was talking. You weren't. I tried to make things work, Ricky. I didn't run and get plastered every time we had a problem. I didn't quit on us. You did. I did? Did not! That's a bunch of shit, you know that? You let it go, you let everything go. L... How do you... All the jobs you blew. Your father gets you in at Willoughby and you even blow that. Hey, that's not all my fault. You had to show up in that bar with that guy. Rick, grow up. I'm trying. Look, I'm running a school now. I'm in charge of it. I'm the principal. I heard. At Brandel. (ENGINE STARTS) Now, what the hell is that supposed to mean? Huh? (MEN CHATTERING) Hello, heaven Heaven, can you hear me? Hello, heaven Heaven, oh, I call your name Hello, heaven Heaven, can you hear me? Hello, heaven Oh, gotta fight the panic Gotta justify the pain Gotta get romantic Get closer to the flame Sun rules the planets Moon controls the tide My mind considers but my heart decides Hello, heaven Heaven, can you hear me? Hello, heaven Heaven, oh, I call your name Hello, heaven BOY: Yo, Father J, where's Raymi at? I know you're in here. I saw you come in. You're safe. Those guys ran down the hall. The coast is clear. Come on, why don't you come out? We can bullshit a little bit. All right, if you want to be a fuckin' sissy, that's your prerogative. I ain't no sissy, motherfucker. Oh, no? How come you were runnin' so fast? You'd run too if you were on their shit list. Hey, I'm on everybody's shit list, man. I just can't run that fast. Hey, come on. How about it? Come on over here. Come on, let's go down to the office, talk a little bit. You and me. All right? Maybe I can help you. You know, maybe we can do something about those guys. Shit, like what? We'll get 'em expelled. Busted. Something. (CHUCKLES) Man, do you know where you are? You're at Brandel. Ain't you heard what they say about this school? Garbage never leaves the dump, man. So they ain't gonna leave. Neither are you. Me? What about me? What are you talking about? Man, you're in the dump, too, sucker. Word gets around fast at Brandel. Let me tell you, man, everybody knows about you. Hey, you're full of shit, kid, you know that? No, no. You're full of shit! You're that fuck-up teacher from Willoughby, huh? And that's the only reason your sorry ass is even in this place. So fuck you, man! Don't try to be no principal with me, man, 'cause I don't need your sorry shit. Huh. Son of a bitch! (SIGHS) Can I have your attention, please? Can I have your attention? Thank you. Harkley, don't you teach an 11th grade social science class in Room 212 this period? I really find dialectic and class struggle rather dull, especially when it's being discussed with a double-digit vocabulary. Hmm. Harkley, I want you and everybody else in this room... Hold it, Darcy! To help seat all the students in an all-school assembly in the auditorium, sixth period today. - An "assembly"? - That's right. Are you mad? Do you know what can happen? What are you doing this for? I like the attention. (ALL CHATTERING) Holy shit. BOY 1: Get off my foot! BOY 2: You got another one. I'm not going to... (MIC FEEDS BACK) I'm not gonna stand up here and give you a lecture about the values of education. (ALL CHEERING) BOY: Thank you. I just have two simple words. No more. BOY: Yo, man, I got two words for you. Fuck you! (STUDENTS LAUGHING) I'm very impressed. They told me that you couldn't form complete sentences here at Brandel. (ALL BOOING) No more! (STUDENTS MUTTERING INDISTINCTLY) No more missing classes, no more gambling, no more extortion, no more selling drugs on this campus, no more gang intimidation, arson, robbery, rape, or whatever the hell you've been majoring in here. No more! You're probably saying to yourself that that son of a bitch can't do anything. (ALL CHEERING) That you can't expel students from Brandel. Well, that might be true. Well, that goes the same for principals. You can't expel me, either. So as long as I'm here, I can promise you one thing. That I will do everything in my power to enforce my painfully simple rule of "No more." I know what you're thinking. You gotta live with me, and I gotta live with... Sit down. I said, sit down! Usher, you wanna show this gentleman to his seat, please? You talk too much. (ALL CHEERING) All right, just hold it down. Hold it down now. Shut this dumb shit down. Stop it! Hey, Jake! Usher, you wanna show these gentlemen to their seats, please? (ALL SHOUTING) All right, sit down, everybody! (ALL SCREAMING) Son of a bitch. (ALL CLAMORING) BOY: Man, get him, get him! Fuck him up! Break it up! So much for that warm ass in a chair routine. Okay, okay. Mr. Duncan! That was a, uh, admirable display of poise and leadership. You know, you work real hard, and maybe I can get you a spot on the student council. The principal's a funny guy. Yeah, well, let me tell you something really funny. Classes and schoolwork. Because from now on, that's the only business you're gonna be conducting at Brandel. My only business, huh? If you wanna stay in my school, it is. Your school? Your school's shit, clown! "Classes and schoolwork"? Do you want that to be my only business here at Brand X, huh? You want that to be my only business, then you're gonna need this. "Cause this school here is my school. And I make the rules. Not anymore. (SCOFFS) (SNAPS FINGERS) (STUDENTS CHATTERING) Whoa! (HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYING) Hey, think you're on a bus? Huh?

Man, he can't turn it off. GIRL: Cool, cool. Get back in line, big face. Is this the exchange window? I'm afraid mine's been soaked in window fluid. This is some good shit. Don't touch till you've made a deposit. - What are you doing? - I'm making a deposit. You stupid fuck. You know who those belong to? I don't care who they belong to. All I care about is I don't wanna see you selling this shit in this school again. Yeah, motherfucker, somebody's gonna come looking for you. Yeah? Well, you tell that somebody that I'm in the office at the end of the hall. Somebody's gotta clean this place up. Not me. (EXHALING DEEPLY) Ah, good. Latimer, this is not necessary. Good morning. I said the entire security force. I heard ya. - That's it? - This is it. All right, look, I want every assistant from the athletic department, I want every class schedule, and I want every student's attendance record in my office, right now. "Right now"? No. Surprise me on my birthday. God damn it, Latimer! Hey! That's Mr. Latimer to you, Darcy. RICK: Now, look. I want these guys put on temporary payroll as security guards. - What? - They're being deputized. Give 'em some stinking badges, Darcy. But they're teachers! They're big teachers. (SIGHS) (BELL RINGS) MAN: Everybody out of the halls. Put that thing out. Call it quits. All right. Come on, sleepy. Quincy, wake up. Get in there. Pay attention. Come on. What are you, crazy?

Excuse me! - Excuse me. -(STUDENTS GRUMBLING) This is a classroom. These are students. And look, how considerate. They saved you a seat. Hey, man, get your motherfucking hands off me, fool! Hey, I'll bust your fuckin' eye, man. Sit down. Come on. Shake a leg. Baby fat, what you doing in here, man? You doing this class shit? Yo, man, chill. Yeah, well, Victor gonna really smoke you good, man. Hey, wet Willie, sit down! Go ahead. Continue, Emile. I wasn't saying nothing. Yeah, you was, you lying shit. You was talking about how you was trying to drive us whites out of the school business. You've got your tongue so far up Victor's asshole, you can taste his breakfast. That's an excellent description, Mr. Mawby. Do you speak from experience? (STUDENTS LAUGH) (BELL RINGS) Okay, I want three journal pages from everyone. Everyone! Tomorrow! (STUDENTS MUTTERING) That's three pages from you, too, Jojo. See if you can fit it in between your scout meetings and your charity work, okay? I feel real bad for you, doughboy. Ooh! I'm real scared, Jojo. JOJO: Next time, you won't be so lucky. Sorry for the, uh, inconvenience. Doing some remodeling. - That's what you're doing? - Mmm-hmm. Latimer, this is my classroom, and these are my kids. And I'm hanging on to this class by the skin of my teeth. And you come bursting in here with these thugs! I resent you, and I resent what you're doing in here! You think you're so tough? Fuck you! Emile! (DOOR SLAMS) I have a way with women. You know, she likes me. Hey. I can blow you away anytime I want, man. Is that what you want? Huh? If that's what you want, man, I'm right here. Come on, there's nobody else around. Come on. We could go down to the court, shoot some hoops, you know? Bullshit a little bit. You know, I heard you were really good... Yo, yo, look, man. If you're trying to reach me, I'd just cut your hand off. I got another one. Look, why don't you just do yourself a favor, okay? And go back to your white-bred suburban cesspool land while you still got a chance, all right? (SIGHING) I can't. (STAFF CHATTERING) Good morning. Good morning, ladies. - Mr. Latimer. - That's true. I need your signature on this release form. The girl you busted in the toilet wants to drop out. Mr. Latimer, it's one thing to incite riots with school assemblies. But when you start dumping animals in my classroom... "Animals"? I'd rather have animals. They don't carry knives. "Knives"? TEACHER: It was getting so much better. Xavier stopped talking back to me. Liz and Stacy started bringing in homework. I was finally getting through to them, when all of a sudden, I have six more seated in my class, who have absolutely no respect for anything. They throw things, and one of them urinated on the floor. "Urinated on the floor"? Urinated on the floor. I heard you. The whole class is in turmoil. Nobody's learning anything. It's pushed me back to the beginning. Well, I'm sorry. I hoped that wouldn't have happened. TEACHER: What are you going to do about it? Well, are those students on your attendance sheets? Yes, but I don't... Then the law says that you have to teach 'em. Oh, that's right. Blame it on the law. They don't have to be in there. They never were before. There's nothing stopping you from bending the law. It's a tradition at Brandel. Yeah? Well, that tradition is dead. Come on, you people. You can't pick and choose your students. You gotta take the students that the school gives you, and teach them the best you can. You can't just teach the easy ones and throw the rest in the garbage. You're having trouble dealing with a student, then you come to me. If he won't come out of the classroom, I'll come up and get him. Now, look, every student we leave in the hallways, every student we leave in an alley, every student that we leave roaming around in the parking lot, is another brick off the foundation of this school. Darcy! Darcy, come back here. Come on. Now, look. Lighten up! Have a little courage. Brave it through a little bit. Look, stone face, knives only hurt if it goes through you. (SIGHING) Urine only smells if you don't clean it up. Come on! I'll take care of this. Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm. Man, that was pure poetry. Especially that part about each kid being a brick in this shithouse. Man, that gave me goose pimples. Look, I got goose pimples running all up my arm. See that? Look. Look at that one! - Good. -(CHUCKLING) "Good." - Hey! Hi. - CHILD: Bang! -(GASPS) (SIGHS IN RELIEF) - Hi! - Mom! "Mom"? The fuck? What do you want? -"Mom"? - So I have a kid. Now get outta here before somebody sees you out. Okay. What do you want? I want you to graduate. I don't want you to drop out. Look, Treena, your grades are good enough for it. Don't throw it away. Shit, "throw it away"? Don't nobody care if I graduate or not. I care. Is that enough? I care. Why? I ain't selling dope in your bathroom no more. Plus, Victor got me a better job. "Victor"? "A better job"? Look, if you want a job, why don't you go out and get a real job? TREENA: What's a real job to you? Motherfuckin' burger joint 10 miles away, with a two-year waiting list? Get outta here. You make me sick. I'm gonna tutor you. All right? You come to Room 211 at 6:00 in the morning, every morning this week, and I'll teach you. What you gonna do that for? Just show up! 6:00. And then you can do whatever job you want to do. Go ahead and be there. Hope you like teaching by yourself. Fool. (FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) You're late. Okay. What do you wanna start with? The bathroom. All right, hurry up. My little Charles, he was asking about you. (BOYS LAUGHING) My bike. My bike! Hey, come on! God damn it! What... My bike! Hey, stop it! What are... (MUFFLED SHOUTING) (GRUNTING) (GROANS) (GROANS) (COUGHS) (STUDENTS MURMURING) You... Phillips! (INDISTINCT CHATTERING) Who did it? I know you saw it. Who did it? We can't tell you. We can put it back together if you want. I do. Like it was. Hey, guess what, Latimer? I'm giving you the day off. Come on. What did he spot you? 50, 60 bucks? I don't know what you're talking about. I was only trying to help you. You don't know what help is! You ever heard a baby cry 'cause it was hungry? Yeah, sure. "Yeah, sure." Good. Then you know it's a crying nothing but food is gonna fix. And when you gotta listen to that crying, you know ain't nothing you can do except you gotta get something in that kid's mouth. You do whatever it takes, okay, Mr. Principal? You got three months left till you graduate, Treena. Look, screw it, man. I'm sorry about what happened today. Just leave. That's it? Just go? You think I'm not dying to get out of this shit hole? You think I want to live like this? You're wrong, sucker, 'cause I don't. But some of us don't have a choice like that. That's bullshit! I gave you a choice, and you screwed me! Then why you still wasting your time? Because if you quit, that means I let you quit. That means I quit, too. So, I want you in that classroom at 6:00 tomorrow morning. And if you're not there, I'm gonna come up here, I'm gonna drag your ass in there. You're crazy. Yeah. Yeah, I'm crazy. -(DOOR CLOSES) - You just show up! I said like it was. That looks all right. (TURNING ON IGNITION) We can give 'em bag number three, four, five... Your choice. I don't know what kind of type dealers these are. (CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY) (INAUDIBLE) (DRUG DEALER SHOUTING) (GRUNTS) No, let me. Kill that motherfucker! BOY: Oh, fuck, man! Oh, my God. RICK: They're gonna like you in prison, Victor. You might even get a surprise up that wise little ass of yours. No one saw nothing. Yeah? You think so, huh? Home, James. (DOOR SLAMS SHUT) Now, what the hell is wrong with you? That blow in the head give you brain damage, or something? - Anybody see anything? - No! Nobody's gonna identify him! Man! Man, you're lucky that I'm not scraping your dead ass off that street after a bullshit move like that. Who do you think you are? Dirty Harry or somebody? Yeah. (SIGHING) I lost my head. JAKE: Yeah, it's a good thing that's all you lost. I been protecting your ass left and right around here, but once we get out there, outside these school grounds, man, you are on your own! Yeah? Well, maybe now Duncan knows I'm not kidding around anymore. Yeah? Victor Duncan doesn't learn lessons. But he's gonna come back and teach you one. You can believe that shit. - Jake? - What? Why are you so afraid of him? Man, the only thing that I'm afraid of is if me and that boy lock horns, either he's gonna kill me or I'm gonna kill him. There won't be no overtime. That is the only thing that I'm afraid of. I took myself through this school, by myself. Victor Duncans gonna come and go. One comes up, the other one goes down. There's always gonna be one. I'm lucky to get out of here with my face intact. Why did you come back? This is the launching pad, man. It's the glory days. The glory days! When there was a football team, I had three consecutive 900-yard seasons. "The Phillips-head Screwdriver." Led me to a diploma, university scholarship. After two years, I pleaded hardship. Got drafted by the New York Titans. I had one pretty promising season there. Then, pop! Busted my knee. In an exhibition game, too. Shit. I didn't come back 100%. I got axed. No name, no fame. No more of that long green I was really getting used to. So, ... I came back here. Came back to Brandel. To see if I could find that, that... That thing that sprung me out of here in the first place. Well, I'm glad you came back. - I'm glad you're here. - JAKE: Eh, I know you're glad. You'd be dead by now. That what you want? Right now... This is all I got. This is it. And you know what? I'm gonna make a school out of this place. That's for sure. See you later. (DOOR CLOSES) FEMALE TEACHER: Okay, this afternoon, we're gonna be working on geometry, okay? RICK: Hey, Arturo. What are you doing? Just, like, hanging out, man. Why don't you, like, hang out at home? What's at home? I don't know. Hey, good job on the tank and the helmet. Really inspiring work, you know that? Come on, we gotta get going. We gotta get outta here. I was sort of waiting for Miss Orozco. Ooh! Got a little boner for Miss Orozco, huh? (CHUCKLING) Don't you think she's a little old for ya? No. No! (EXCLAIMS) No! No. (PANTING) (SCREAMS) We gotta lock up. (WHIMPERING) (SCREAMING) Stop! (GROANING) -(EXCLAIMS) - Shut up! God, stop. (WHIMPERING) God! No! God, no! -(SOBBING) - Don't need this no more! That's the last time you ever make fun of me, bitch! Get the fuck away from me! (GROANING) - Oh, dear God! - Get up! Come on! (CONTINUES GROANING) You son of a bitch! (SOBBING) (BREATHING HEAVILY) RAYMI: I like to think sometimes, when I'm sitting here, that I can close my eyes and turn into a pigeon, and go gliding down the hall. Harkley's head be all spinning and shit! And sometimes at my house, when me and the old man would cut lip, I go up on the roof and think about being a pigeon too. But then I see that there be too many pigeons sitting up there, doing nothing, man, Just flapping their wings and shit. Going nowhere. So I think that, then maybe screw that pigeon stuff. I'd like to be a hawk. Because the hawk cops for himself. I could go gliding all the way to Spain if I want. I cop for myself. I'd like to be a rock star, or open my own body shop, you know? "Raymi's Body Shop." But I know [ just be dreaming. And I get mad 'cause it hurt too much when you come down off the roof with nothing, man. Nothing but pigeon shit on your shoes. DARCY: Hospital said her wrist was fractured. And she's, uh, pretty bruised up. Pretty rattled. No one's sure when she'll be able to come back. Now you know what it takes to get a kid expelled from school. Someone's been snorting their happy dust today. Yeah, he's high. Since White Zac's been jailed, he's celebrating his new reign of undisputed king of the school. Except for Pete Rose, here, of course. - Who, me? - Yeah, you. Hey, come on, Screwdriver, I told you I'm making you the principal. And I told you what you can do with your job. - Well, I just can't do that today. - JAKE: Uh-huh. Hey, hey, Raymi, come here.

Okay, let's see. The journal assignment was, "Why did they call World War I the war to end all wars?" Obviously, it wasn't the last world war or it wouldn't have a number one after it. So, what was their reason of thinking that this was gonna be the last war? Yeah? BOY: Because, man, if you kill off all your enemies, there won't be no one left to fight you. That's true. Good, that's good. That's good thinking. That's a stupid reason, Ricky. Is that an invitation? I mean, you wanna join me after school for 200 push-ups, Emile? I don't want that shit, man. Okay, any other answers? Yes? "Cause it would change all the differences they would ever have. -(SCOFFS) - That's what they were thinking. Very good. Who is you? Miss Albert Einstein?
