[instrumental music] (Cheryl) Okay, thanks. (Francine) One, two, and one and two. And one and two, and one and two. And one and two, and one and two. -And one and two-- -Where's Ben? Upstairs, and one and two. One and two, and one and two. One and two, and one and two. And one and two, and one and two. And one and two, and one and two.. [instrumental music] [thunder crashing] [telephone ringing] -Yes, hello? -Hi, Mr. Miller. (Cheryl) It's, um, Cheryl. I-I think I have what you're looking for. -When can I see a picture? -Um, tomorrow. [sighs] Good. -It's been such a long time. -Okay, well, I'll see you. [thunder crashing] [sighs] [door slams] [coughing] Hi, kitty. ♪ Let's see Jonathan brush those pegs ♪ ♪ Cha-cha-cha-cha-cha ♪ He wouldn't need a stool if he had longer legs ♪ ♪ Cha-cha-cha-cha-cha ♪ [doorbell rings] Hi, Cinderella. Jonathan! What a pleasant surprise! I bet I know why you're here. Come in, come in. Whoo! You gotta clean out these litter pans, Mrs. Beauchamps. -They stink. -Today. It's on my schedule. Now, now, don't do that. I'll be back after school. Oh, you are a saint, boy. Thank you very much. -Now, in you go. -Hi, Tiger. Yeah. How's your breakfast, Mr. Pussycat? Oh. Oh, oh, Ti-Tiger's the healthy one. He knocks his little brothers and sisters all about. [laughs] In two weeks you're going to be able to bring him home. [cats mewing] Your mother said no again? Oh, these children! These fruits of neglect, of divorce. But the day will come. Armageddon! I warned you all. Haven't I? And this, this mother who won't even let you have a cat. -Is she insane? -No, Mrs. Beauchamps. -I-I gotta go. -Oh, no, I'm sorry. I-I didn't mean to be critical, my dear child. It's not that. It's just... You can't tell anyone, Mrs. Beauchamps, but I'm meeting my father at Jensen's before school. Oh, yes. The father, of course, the father. But-but you won't be able to go to Jensen's. Why not? Well, 'cause Jensen's is closed. They're fixing it up or somethin'. Why, I don't know. I went there the other day and it was just workmen and dust, and it was all a terrible mess. Everybody else is going to Mitchell's in the next block. Now you mark my words, if your father's in the know, that's what he's going to do too. [indistinct chatter] -Good morning, young man. -Good morning. -I'm waiting for my dad. -Mm. Um, he'll be having coffee, black. And I guess I'll be having chocolate milk, please. Okay, uh, why don't we wait till he arrives so the coffee will be nice and hot? Okay. All these people from Jensen's? Gosh, I hope so. Good morning, sir. Can I get you some coffee? No, thank you. [bell ringing] [indistinct chatter] [bell ringing] [telephone ringing] [coughing] This better be good. Go back to class, Marguerite. -Yeah? -Hello, Martha. Sarah. -I'm sorry to wake you. -Oh! Sarah, I know what this is about. Jonathan hasn't committed to a career. -What can I do? I try. -I was checking on him. He's never missed a day of school and I hadn't heard from you, and I wanted to make sure he's okay. Why should he be at school? It's Saturday, Sarah. What are you doing at school? Still a little over dedicated, are we? God, I remember you. The last protester at old Columbia U, heroic and alone. It's Tuesday, Martha. Oh, yeah, of course, it's Tuesday. Well, I must have dozed off after, um... Yeah, Jonathan went to school. Wh-what? He's really not there? No. It's, uh, it's almost 9:00. -He's not with you? -Hold on. Sarah, he's not here. Are you sure he left for school? Yeah, of course, I'm sure. -What time? -What do you mean what time? I don't know the exact second in-in time to get there. He always goes with, uh, uh, the older boys, Richard and Matt, and a bunch of them, yeah. No, no, no, no, no, they haven't seen him. Uh, do you think something's happened? No, I don't. I, um... I just wondered, um... Look, this is probably nothing. Please don't get upset. But I-I spoke to one of Jon's classmates who thought he might be with his father. Patrick is in England acquiring fame. Besides, he's supposed to let me know when he wants to see him. Now why don't you have a look around outside and I'll, uh, I'll see what I can find out from his little friend here at school? You know, it's possible Patrick is back and Jon's with him, simple as that. -So don't worry, okay? -Yeah, thanks. -Uh, thanks for calling, Sarah. -Bye. [sighs] Mm, tastes good, huh? Honey, I don't think your daddy's gonna make it today. But I'll watch out for him and tell him you were here, okay? You're already late for school now. Ah, my treat. Excuse me. Sorry. Uh, i-is your name Jonathan? I-I couldn't help but overhear what you were saying there. My name is Lawrence. I-I work with your father. And he told me to come down here and-and meet you, and I didn't realize you were sitting right there in the next booth. -You are Jonathan, right? -Where's my dad? Well, he's gonna come meet you as soon as he can, but he just got tied up in this meeting and he, he couldn't get out of it. He's, he's really sorry. -He's not coming? -Yes. Yes, he's coming. Just as soon as he can. We're supposed to decide where to meet him and, and let him know. I-I came down here so you-you wouldn't have to sit here alone. Uh, I guess you're pretty disappointed, huh? -I gotta go to school. -No, you don't. No, Jonathan, your dad called the school and they said it'd be okay, just for today. -He did? -It's okay. I mean, he knows how much you like school but one day. -How do you know my dad? -We, we work together. -I'm right down the hall. -Then are you his publisher? No, I'd, I'd like to be a publisher, but, uh, maybe some day. I'm-I'm-I'm an editor. Your-your dad writes things and I sort of, you know, fix them and... Look, why don't we just decide where to meet your dad and then we'll, uh, call him and let him know? Well... You know, maybe he could meet us at the zoo or something. Your dad said you might say that. Well, my dad knows me pretty well. Well, look, would it be, um... Would it be okay if I walked you there? I mean, you seem like pretty interesting company to me. If you don't mind being with an old grownup. Would that be okay? I-I guess so. Well, okay then. We'll go to the zoo. We'll call your dad from there. How about it, huh? Shake? [dramatic music] Jonathan? Jonathan? Ah. Jon... Jonathan? What is this? Oh, I did it again. [sighs] (Jonathan) Did you know that giraffes are related to deer? They're even related to hippopotamuses. Mm-hmm. Most people don't know that. I'd have to say that next to cats, giraffes are my very favorite animal. Hippopotamuses are related to giraffes? No, I didn't know that. Let's see, um... On my behalf, no one would laugh if I'd only half the grace of a giraffe. That's a poem. Not a very good one, but... -Do you like poetry? -Yeah. Yeah, I guess, yeah, I make up poems sometimes. You do? Yeah, not very good ones either. You know, cats are my favorite too. -Really? Do you have one? -Mm-hmm. I used to. Not any more. What about you? Yeah, I have a kitten named Tiger. Only my mom won't let me... Hey, you can tell me, Jonathan. You can tell me anything. I keep great secrets. Well, you know, she wont let me keep him in the house. They're too much trouble. That's crazy, cats are no trouble at all. -I know. -I'd let you keep a cat. You could have one cat or two cats or five cats or... I mean, you love animals. Doesn't she know that? I guess so. I don't know. Well, if you wanted to keep a giraffe, that'd be something different, or two giraffes. I mean, you know, they're kind of tall. Can we call my dad now? Um, right, sure. Um, let's just find a phone. -I think there's one over here. -Okay. [instrumental music] [knocks] Katie! Come on, it's me. Open up! Don't you ever answer your phone? Red, it's morning. What do you want? Look, Jonathan never showed up at school and nobody knows where he is. I'm gonna go over there 'cause I don't know what else to do. I left a note for him on my door over there telling him to come over here in case he gets here before I do, okay? Will you be home this morning? No, I'm going to Borneo. Yeah, okay, well, uh, stay awake, okay? Take a drink. Hey, uh, don't worry. You probably just forgot where you put him, sweetie. I swear, I don't know how she ever got custody of a terrific kid like Jonathan. -She's a good mother. -You know what I mean. No, I don't and I don't want you to tell me. Miss Jennings, I know you try to protect her, but everyone knows that she's a drunk. I'm surprised you'd listen to what everyone knows, Julia. I thought you were smarter than that. -What happened, Martha? -I don't know. You'd never let him leave the house alone. Never. I know you. Were you awake when he left? I don't, I don't know, maybe, maybe I, I fell as-asleep or something. I, I didn't sleep very well last night and I think I took a sleeping pill. He's probably just gone somewhere else. Where? I mean, he... Did he say anything? He would tell you, wouldn't he? He wouldn't just run off. I don't remember, Sarah! Look, I'm getting over the flu and I'm on this medication. -It's just lethal. -Look, Martha, listen to me. Don't take anything until this is all over. -You promise? -Sure. Oh, no, don't worry. Yeah. (Sarah) Julia, I, uh, I want all the children in the auditorium in half an hour. Maybe someone saw Jon today. Oh, also, would you bring us some coffee, please? Marguerite, you remember Mrs. Tierney, Jonathan's mother. Now she wants to know what Jon said about meeting his father. He didn't say anything. (Sarah) Marguerite, you told me it was Jonathan. I did not. It was the other kids. Sarah. Look, Marguerite... we don't know where Jonathan is. Now you're good at solving mysteries, and we need your help to solve this one, okay? Now, maybe he's with his father or maybe he's someplace else. I'll bet you know all kinds of secret hiding places he might be. Places no one else knows about. He could have gone to Mrs. Beauchamps'. (Sarah) Mrs. Beauchamps? Who's that? She's an old recluse who lives on Sidney Place. -Why would he go there? -I don't know. Jonathan might be in trouble, and if you know anything, tell us. He, he has a kitten there. A kitten? He said you hate animals and you wouldn't let him have one at home. Why would he say something like that? That's what he said! -Sarah. -Marguerite, thanks, honey. -Mrs. Beauchamps' number. -Thanks, Julia. You know her? Yeah. Just she lives in the neighborhood with about 500 cats. Maybe Jon's there. [phone rings] -Hello, Mrs. Beau-- -Oh, hello, Mary. No, this is, uh, this is Sarah Jennings, from St. Edwards School. I can't afford to give anything-- No. No. We, uh, hello? We, uh, we-we just wanna know. -Is Jonathan Tierney there? -Not now. (Sarah) Did he visit you this morning to see his kitten? -Yes, yes. He went to meet... -Yes? -When? -Before school. (Sarah) Thank you. Goodbye. Jonathan was there. He, uh, went to Jensen's Cafe to meet his father. Patrick. I don't believe it. No, of course, I believe it. Why didn't you tell me not to marry that jerk when you had a chance? I'm going to Jensen's. I'm even going to enjoy this. [indistinct chatter] (Sarah) Hello, hi. Uh, I'm looking for a little boy. He was supposed to be here about 8 o'clock this morning-- (female #1) Well, we've been real busy all morning. (Sarah) Uh, eight years old, wearing a school uniform from St. Edwards. [glasses shatter] Sorry! Jesus. Really, nobody saw him? Uh, she's not sure. She's been really busy all morning. -Damn it! -Should we... Should we try Patrick's apartment? No, he doesn't get to do this. I'm calling the police. Oh. [telephone rings] [low growling] (Cheryl) Hello? -Yeah, Cheryl? -Yes. -Yes, Lawrence Muller. -Did you pick him up yet? Yes, I have him with me. And I just wanted you to know that he's, he's wonderful. -So intelligent. He's-- -Where are you? The zoo. He adores animals. [chuckles] I mean, he is, he's perfect. He's absolutely lovely. You have no idea how long I've waited for this. -You know where to take him? -Uh, yes. 536 West of 102, number 5A. -Are you going now? -Yes, soon. Well, good, I-I'll see you there. But I just wanted to thank you. Guess what. He even loves poetry. Uh, when-when will you be there? -Three o'clock. -Three... No. What do you mean 3 o'clock? 10 o'clock. But it can't be 3 o'clock. It's 10 o'clock. We said 10 o'clock. You-you told me 10 o'clock. Not 3 o'clock, 10 o'clock. This is my time with him, damn it. This is my time. This is our deal. 10 o'clock, not 3 o'clock, right? Okay, calm down, okay? Just calm down. I'll, I'll make arrangements for 10 o'clock. Good thinking. Yes, 10 o'clock. -I'll be there. -Okay, good. Calm down. [tiger growling] Yeah, hi, I'm trying to contact, uh, Patrick Tierney. I believe he's a guest at your hotel. Do not think of him as a child of divorce, Sgt. Mooney. It's a waste of your time. And it offends me. But you're pretty sure your husband took him? Well, I never knew he wanted to be a single parent, but-- No, that means he had to get in touch with Jonathan without your knowledge. No, Jonathan would have told me. He's a very honest boy. He didn't tell you about his kitten, Mrs. Tierney. He didn't tell you where he was going this morning, so I don't know, do I? What is this? Wh-why am I being interrogated? You're not. I'm just asking a couple of questions. Okay, look, and this is an easy one... 'cause you said on the phone you didn't know exactly what time Jonathan left the house this morning. Now why not? -Because I went back to sleep. -Mm-hmm. What, you made his breakfast, you did the normal morning routine, chatted a bit. But you felt a little sleepy. So before he left, you dozed off. I took a sleeping pill last night. Mm-hmm. Now school starts, what, 8:30? But Jonathan left Mrs. Beauchamps' little after 7:30. Now that means he had to get up at least an hour earlier than usual. Now if my kid did that, I would swear he was meeting the Martians or somethin'. I mean, didn't you think to ask why so early? Didn't it occur to you maybe Jonathan was going somewhere other than school, which would mean he'd be out on the streets alone? I was asleep. I didn't see Jon this morning. I don't know what time he left. Mr. Tierney checked out of his London hotel two days ago. And the kid still hasn't shown up at Jensen's. Do you have a photograph of Jonathan, Mrs. Tierney? Yes. [exhales] -When was this taken? -About, uh, about three... -About three years ago. -When he was five? (Jeff) You don't have anything more recent? -Maybe at home. -Um... No, I, uh, I don't... I, uh, I don't feel real well. Where's the ladies room? Uh, up-up the stairs to the left. You, you want me to go with you? (Martha) No. We are wastin' our time with her. Do you know who she is? Or was? -No. -That's Red Tierney. She used to write a column for the "New York Times." Red Tierney, that was her byline. I used to read it all the time. And she is one damn good investigative reporter. She won two National Journalism Awards in the process. She's a courageous, loving person. Don't say you're wasting your time. [dramatic music] [sighs] Patrick. You son of a bitch. Where's Jon? [scoffs] Well, it's good to see you too. Isn't he here? [trumpets] Here you go. That one's yours. Did you talk to my dad? No, I, I don't know what it is with him today. He's-he's still tied up in a meeting. Yeah, I saw the paper. It happened over there about... Tell you what, let's take a walk, okay? [indistinct chatter] Your father's secretary said we should meet him at his agent's apartment. Where? Where? Um, uptown. Dad says his agent lives in New Jersey. [sighs] Right. Right, he does. But maybe he's got an apartment in Manhattan. Maybe your dad made him rich. -When do we have to be there? -He really didn't say. Look, Jonathan, if you don't wanna do this, you know, we can just... Here. You can take... Take this and go out there and get a taxi, and you can go back to school and you can tell them that you're not gonna see your dad today, okay? That's a good boy. I'm not gonna go see my dad? No, not today, you're not. Unh-unh. Please, Lawrence. [dramatic music] Sure. We'll go see your dad. I just want you to be happy, that's all. You know, I didn't know that I was going to make a new friend today. It's nice. The world gets a little lonely sometimes. (Mooney) How did you arrange to see him? Jonathan and I have been writing to each other... [bell rings] In our last letter, I-- You're supposed to ask me when you wanna see him! Martha, I didn't want a fight and I sure as hell don't want one right now. So you just had him lie to me? You didn't realize he was gonna be out there on the street by himself? Well, he wouldn't have to lie if his mother wasn't some irresponsible drunk. -Hey! -Bastard! Oh, I'm a bastard now? (Mooney) You watch your manners, Mr. Tierney. -My manners-- -Watch your manners. Yes, sir. (Julia) Okay, kids, come on, let's go. Move it, move it. Into the auditorium, right now. I can smell it from here. I suggest we continue this elsewhere. What do you say? (Mooney) Were you planning to take Jonathan away from his mother? Is that what you told him, huh? That I took him? -Is that what you're telling... -That's exactly what I told. Why didn't you tell her you wanted to see him? Because I missed him. I haven't seen my boy in four months. We were gonna hang out for a half hour, you understand? In the past, my ex-wife has made it real difficult for me to see my son. Oh, boy. In the future, I suggest you ask. -You understand that? -Sure. Good. You happen to have a recent photo of Jonathan, Mr. Tierney? Of course, I do. Does he know how to get in touch with you? Of course, he does. He's got my phone number. (Martha) Where'd you get that? (Jonathan) I've been on all the bridges, but the Brooklyn Bridge is my favorite. (Lawrence) It's a beauty, alright. What about the West Side Highway? Been on that? (Jonathan) Uh, no, I don't think I have. (Lawrence) Well, let's take the scenic route then. (Jonathan) Okay. Cool. (female #2) Alright, children, let's get lined up... (Patrick) You want me to drop you at the house? I can walk. (Patrick) Martha, it's on my way. (Mooney) Let's get a bunch of these made up and get 'em out all over the Heights pronto. Hey, Martha, I wonder... What? Well, with all the, uh, publicity on my new book, I-I wonder if, uh... What? They kidnapped him for ransom? Yeah. You aren't that famous yet, Patrick. It's the same old Martha and the same old mouth. Where'd you get that picture of Jonathan? What difference does it make? Hey. Why don't you do us all a favor and, uh, try and stay sober? Yeah, and, boy, I hope they find Jonathan soon so you don't miss any more of those important meetings. [mellow music] [screams] [sighs] [door opens] Jonathan! Hi, Katie. Did I see you climb out of a Jaguar a little while ago? I'm glad I've got at least one famous friend. Who was that? Oh, oh, boy, you look terrible. Yeah, thanks. That was Patrick. Patrick? He's back? -You two getting back together? -Oh, please. Looks like he's doin' pretty good. -Maybe you ought to. -We can't find Jon. Don't worry about that kid. He's eight going on fifteen. He's probably out playing hooky with some underage girl. Come on, Red. Come on. You need a drink. The cat would not drag you in the way you look. Now let me think about this. What is it again that you drink? -Vodka, right? What a memory. -I-I don't want a drink. Well, you may not want one, but you sure as hell need one. -I don't want a drink. -What... -What? Where you goin'? -I'm going out. Look, stay here and answer the phones, alright? [sighs] [cat meows] [knocks] Mrs. Beauchamps? It's-it's Martha Tierney, Jonathan's mother. I-I-I wanna thank you for giving Jon the kitten. We'll be bringing him home soon. Would you like to see Tiger? He-he is really, he is very cute. Oh. Uh, Jon's disappeared. Oh, what happened? He was here with you this morning? Yes, I told the lady that. W-well, now the police are looking for him. Uh, did, did he talk about going any place else? The police? Now they'll blame me for not letting him go to Jensen's. Why do you think he didn't go to Jensen's? Because it's closed. For refurbishment. Uh, it's-it's open. I was there. Wait a minute, wait. Did, did you tell Jon that-that Jensen's is closed? But I bet you very kindly told him someplace else he could go. Because if-if you did, then I-I could go there, too, just in case. What do you think? Well, the people at, uh, Mitchell's-- Mitchell's! Jesus. They're very nice. [dramatic music] Be there. Okay? Okay. [sirens blaring] Almost there. It's just across the street. [dramatic music] Why didn't the cab take us all the way? Well, I just wanted to stretch my legs a bit. -That was a long ride. -Well, are we late? Your dad will wait. How long's it been since you've seen him? (Jonathan) Four months. I've grown a lot since then. I'll bet. Ah, look, leopards. Hi, kitty. He never went to Jensen's? (Martha) No, he went to a place called Mitchell's Donut Shop. It was on the next block. The waitress there said that she saw a man talking to him inside. And she thinks they left together. Well, did he mention anything at dinner last night to you? -No. -A teacher? A friend? -Somebody he was gonna meet? -No. Martha, I want you to think, alright? You got a tendency to, uh, forget things, and this one's important. Look, you don't have permission to dump on me anymore! Where'd you get that picture of Jonathan? Why is that so important? Because you weren't here to take it. So somebody else took it. What's the big secret? I wanted a photograph of Jonathan. Roger recommended this guy who works at the agency. He's a, he's a junior agent. His name is Barry. He's an amateur photographer. I asked him if he'd take some shots of Jonathan, and so he waited outside the house with a telephoto lens and he took some. Got it? You told a stranger where we live? Martha, he's not a stranger. -He works at the agency. -Do you know him? Do you know who he showed the pictures to? For God's sakes, woman! If you'd have been a little more reasonable I'd have come to you, wouldn't I? -Wouldn't I? -Go to hell, Patrick! You wanted to see me, Mr. Freemantle? Actually, I wanted to see you, Barry. I'm Martha Tierney, Patrick's ex-wife. He said you took some pictures of my son. Is that true? -Yeah, he asked me to. -What did you do with them? What's the problem here? I was just doing a favor for Mr. Tierney. Where'd you have them printed up? I did them myself, I do all my own printing and developing. Uh-huh. You show them to anybody? No. I gave 'em to Mr. Tierney. (Martha) You still have the negatives? I have 'em. Good. The police will wanna see 'em. The police? You wanna tell me what this is all about? [sighs] (Roger) Pat, Pat. I just heard. I'm so sorry. You holding together okay, buddy? Just fine. How did you know I was here? I was married to you for 12 years. So what's goin' on here, folks? (Barry) I have no idea, Mr. Tierney. I wish to hell someone would tell me. Someone... [sighs] Our son, Jonathan, has disappeared. What's that got to do with me? Well, we think somebody took him, Barry. Hey, you don't think I had anything to do with this? Who did you show the pictures to? Nobody! I told you. What are you trying to pin on me? Don't be naive, Barry. New York's a marketplace for kids like Jonathan. Those pictures get in the wrong hands, he could end up in the wrong hands. Thank you, Roger, for spellin' it out. (Barry) Hey, wait a second here! I'm not into pornography, Nothin' like that! Okay? You asked me to take the pictures, Mr. Tierney. Well, you just relax, Barry? Nobody's accusing you of a damn thing! Martha? [sniffles] Are you alright? Roger, have my car brought up from the garage. -I'll take you home. -I'm fine. I'll take a cab. No, no, you are not fine! I wanna help you. Will you let me help you, Martha? We're in this together. Now get it together! (Roger) Sylvia, would you have Travis bring Mr. Tierney's car around? Barry, don't do anything stupid like leave, alright? Hey! I got nothin' to hide, Mr. Tierney. Shut up, Barry. (Lawrence) No, wait. Alright, wait for me here, huh? Let's see. Nope, sorry, wrong way. No, you were right, this way, this is it. This is it. 5...A, bingo. Dad? -You know... -Dad? Dad? [dramatic music] Dad? My dad's not here. I can't believe it. I mean, he said between 12:00 and 12:30. It's 20 to 1:00, I mean... Maybe he got stuck in that same traffic that we got caught in. I thought you said you didn't talk to my dad. I talked to his secretary. Look, we're right by the river here. Why don't we take a look and see what we can see? Are there any... You see some ships or something? What do you see there, huh? Well, there's a statue and... [sniffs] Nobody lives here. Huh, well, you know, maybe they're just moving in or something. Then, what's all this stuff for? Oh, I think his wife's a photographer. That's probably her equipment. I thought you said it was a small apartment. Well, it's not! Why don't you stop asking me so many stupid questions? S-sorry. I'm sorry, Jonathan, I didn't mean that. That was... I, I was just teasing. You know, I'm-I'm... I like it when you ask questions. I mean, you... I admire that in a young man. I really do. You're very smart. Hey, are you mad at me? Hm? I don't want you to be mad at me. You okay? Come on, let's, let's find something to do. You know the photograph I showed you? The kid? His name was Jonathan? -Remember? -Uh... No. Oh, wait, maybe I do. Why? He's been kidnapped or something and they were asking me about this picture like I was... -I don't know. -Who? Who? The police? No. It might come to that though. His parents. Well, what did you tell them, Barry? That I took the picture. That's all I did. I didn't say I showed it to you, don't worry. I mean, they think I'm connected to I don't know what. I mean, it's, it's got me freaked. I can't believe this is happening. You want my advice? Don't tell them anything. W-well, I... W-when I told them, I-- Especially, the cops. Promise me, okay? There's nothing to tell. Well, then there's nothing to worry about. Oh. Mm. [door opens] [door closes] Oh, hi. Oh, hi, Pat. Red and Pat in the same room, I don't believe it. -Are you drunk? -No. (Martha) Do you know what's going on? Jonathan is missing! I asked you to stay here and answer the phone, not to get crocked! What the hell's the matter with you? Well, what's the matter with you? -You take the pledge or some-- -Go on! -Go on home! -Martha, calm down. Go on, go do it in your own house! Martha! Well, why don't we just go down to the kitchen and see if we can get something to drink, hm? I don't want a drink! -Where's my dad? -Well, I don't know exactly. -He's not coming, is he? -Of course, he's coming. You're not his friend! He wouldn't have a friend like you! -You're a liar! -Come here! Come back. Hey, hey, hey! Hey! Come back here. -Come back here! -Help! Help me! -I'm warning you, Jonathan. -Help! Somebody help me! Shut up! You can scream all you want, Jonathan. No one's gonna hear you, huh? Now come on, come on! [grunts] [dramatic music] Open the door, Jonathan. [banging] Open the door! (Mooney) Mrs. Tierney said the waitress at Mitchell's saw Jon leave with a man? Yeah. He's a tall man. He had dark wavy hair. Was that all the description you got? Dark wavy hair. Would you sit down, Mrs. Tierney? You have got to let me handle this. We couldn't get a word out of Mrs. Beauchamps after you talked to her. I understand you spooked Barry Weller pretty good too. -This is killin' us. -I'm sorry. Ah, I just know the photograph's important. You-you'll still talk to him though, right? Sure, if he's not in Canada by now. Mr. Tierney, you think this Barry Weller character is into anything weird? Weird? No, no, I don't think so. Why don't you stay here with your wife? -No, no. -She needs you. Couldn't you get someone to answer the phone at your apartment in case Jon calls there? I got an answering machine. I mean, I guess I could. -Sure. -Hey, terrific, terrific. (Martha) I'm sorry I yelled at you, Katie. You should have told me it was serious. [sighs] -There was a man around here. -A man? (Katie) On the street, in the neighborhood. What, what are you, what are you talking about? I'm talkin' about this guy. 30s. -I saw him. -What did he look like? [exhales] He looked like he had a great body. Sexy. Kind of intense. -Did he have wavy hair? -Yeah. (Katie) Kind of combed back. I'll draw a, a sketch. What in the hell is the matter with you? Why didn't you bring this up earlier? Oh, don't you rag on me too! I didn't know it was important, okay? Are you sure about this? 'Cause I don't want anymore-- Anymore what, huh? Huh? Huh? How'd you stay married to this guy for 12 years? (Patrick) What are you doin'? [sighs] Drawing a picture of this guy. Yeah, I'm an artist, Pat. [scoffs] Ain't it a surprise? Drunks can draw. [sighs] [dramatic music] [telephone ringing] Open the door, Jonathan. I'll break it down! [banging] Shit! [telephone ringing] -Hello? -Lawrence, it's Cheryl. -Cheryl. -Is the boy with you? Yes, don't worry, I have him here. -Well, what are you doing? -What are we doing? Well, we're just playing some games. (Cheryl) And don't forget about 10 o'clock. And don't you worry, I have him here safe and sound. Okay?

Ah! [Martha laughs] [sighs] [grunts] [knocks] (Lawrence) Jonathan. Jonathan, that was your father on the phone. He's on his way. What are you doing, Jonathan? [turns knob] [intense music] [hammering] (Jonathan) Oh. [hammering] [gasps] You wouldn't get a tip from me, pal! (male #1) I wouldn't take a tip from you, lady! Boy, New York, it's a pit. A-a real... -A real pit! -O-okay. (Martha) This the guy you gave the photographs to? I don't know who that is. I didn't ask if you knew him. I asked if you gave him the photographs. No! I said no! How many times do I have to say it? Until your mouth stops twitching. [siren blaring] Do you mind? Could I get in on this? Excuse us. (Mooney) Did you see that picture on my desk? That was my son. I start thinkin', "What if it were him?" It gets real personal, Mr. Weller. You know what I mean? Do you know what I mean? Because then... I want revenge. And the law is on my side, so is the constitution and I love that. But, Mr. Weller, nobody's on your side. You sink in that quicksand. I can only see the top of your head. Maybe a few hairs are showin'. I think you better tell me everything you know. Mm-hmm. [banging] Jonathan, come on. Jonathan? Come on now. You don't have to hide. I'm not going to hurt you. [sighs] Hey. Jonathan? Come on now. Damn it. [dramatic music] Why, Jonathan? Why are you running away from me? Come here. I wanna talk to you, come on! [claps] Come on now! You don't have to run away from me. I'm your friend. I-I-I, I just wanna love you. Come on. Come on, this is stupid. I wanna play. Come on, Jonathan. Jonathan, I know you're here! Hey! Oh, God. [crying] Shit. [crying] Oh, I'm so sorry. [instrumental music] Pasquale, this is ready for duplication, okay? Jake, when these two... -Lock it up. Sal. -Yeah. I wanna use three cameras tonight, okay? -102nd Street? -Yeah, 10:00 p.m. -It will be there. -Okay. [instrumental music] No, I don't know where he is. Oh, are you Ben Nicolaides? -Yes. -We're looking for Cheryl Mason. I understand she works for you. [knock on door] Uh... [knock on door] -Oh, hi. -Oh, hi. I'm, uh, I'm sorry I didn't call. That's okay. Uh, you didn't, uh, you didn't bring the new videos? Oh, that's alright. You can deliver them tomorrow. Um, listen, listen, um, this is probably nothing, but there was a, um, a Detective Mooney at the ballet school lookin' for you today. I can't imagine why. Parking tickets? [both laugh] I don't know. Uh, no, they, they don't send detectives for scofflaws. He, uh, he said a Barry Weller told him you worked at the school. You know this, uh, this Barry Weller? -He's an acquaintance, yeah. -Oh. Sit down, sit down. Mm. [chuckles] I've been rough on you lately. I'm sorry. And, uh, if you're in some kind of trouble, I wanna help. No matter what it is. (Barry) Hey! Hey! Taxi! Taxi! I gotta get to Tribeca, Hudson Street. Fast. Hey! And, uh... Well, Barry was the photographer. His what, his, uh, father wanted some pictures of his kid or somethin'. Anyway, uh, I stole the negatives from Barry and that's the picture I showed you. So why are the cops involved? Cheryl... if you know something, just tell me. It will be alright, baby. Come on, just tell me. Well, uh... I, uh, showed the picture to a, a customer. He, uh, wanted some action, and I made him promise to give me the kid back when he was done so we could use him tonight for the filming. -He took the kid? -Yeah. Why? Uh, I mean, uh, did he pay you? A thousand bucks, but I, I'll give it back, Ben-- That's alright. That's alright. [sobbing] -What's his name? -Uh, Lawrence Muller. -And he's got the kid now? -Yeah. -Where? -Uh, I don't know. [sighs] Cheryl. [sobs] It's Sal's job to get the kids. You're just supposed to deliver the tapes, remember? You stupid bitch. You trusted some horny pervert to pick up this kid? Do you know how fast he'll talk if they pick him up? Now what were you thinking? -Where is he? -I don't know. [screams] [crying] -Tell me! -Ah! [dramatic music] Just-just keep it, keep it. [knocks] Cheryl! It's me, open up! [knocks] Cheryl! [turns doorknob] [grunts] Oh. [dramatic music] Okay. [intense music] [gasps] Oh! It's okay. We've got enough backup. 10-4. (Mooney) Forget how stupid comin' here was and forget how stupid I am to admire you for it, but did you see anyone else besides Barry leave this building? [sighs] Do you think he had time to do this? Uh... These were in her pocket. Look like locker keys to me. Get someone to find out what they open. She, uh, banged her head on the radiator. Bedroom is a mess. Somebody really tore it up. There was a, a guy at the elevator. Who was it? What did he look like? I couldn't see his face. (Jeff) Well, seems like you walk in a minute earlier, we got two corpses on our hands instead of one. Lucky you. [telephone ringing] (Mooney) Answer the phone. Play like you're Cheryl. -No, I can't. -Mrs. Tierney. Don't get timid on me now. Uh... Uh...hello? Some-something's happened. -What do you mean? -He's, uh... I, I can't find him. Who? Who is this? It's Lawrence. Cheryl? Ch... Oh, my God. -Who was it? -Uh, someone named Lawrence. I couldn't find the negative. Maybe Cheryl threw it away. You're not gonna be able to reach me for the next couple of days, but I'll be checking in with you regularly. -Okay. -Now listen, Francine. The police will be back. I was in Jersey visiting my brother. And then I took a little vacation, uh, taking in the fall colors, some crap like that, but I cannot be reached. -Do you understand? -Yeah. That's my girl. Now, burn these and find out where Lawrence Muller lives! -How horrible. -Where is Patrick? Uh, Mooney called. He, he said he needed to talk to him. He-he won't be long. Did you recognize anyone from the, the mug-- Nah, a lot of creepy-looking perverts. -Red. -Oh! Red, you can't go cold turkey like this. Not now. Not with all this going on. -You gotta let me help you. -Ah! Just let me give you a little bit of vodka. No! No! No! [mellow music] [breathing heavily] Oh. (Mooney) Hey, I learned a few things about Cheryl and Ben. -You wanna hear? -Absolutely. He's a porno king. Specialty, using legal age girls who look a lot younger. Then about, uh, three years ago, he got arrested. One turned out to be only 14. He cut a deal with the DA, closed down. Now he runs a real estate business, has a fast photo shop and a ballet school. It's all legit. It's very respectable. Mr. Ben Nicolaides is a scum lord. He's into kiddie porn now. [shaver buzzing] That's his true calling. A pretty tight ship too. Child Exploitation Unit didn't even know he had an operation. We found the lockers. They fit the keys. Each one had a package of kid videos in it. Cheryl must have been, uh, Ben's distributor. She'd probably sell the locker keys to pedophiles, chicken hawks we call them. -You can't arrest him? -No. I can't prove it...yet. Anyway, he's away takin' in the fall colors, real nature-- We found the, uh, negatives for Jonathan's photos in Cheryl's apartment too. -Well hidden. -I don't understand. I-I don't see the connection here. Yeah, I don't know. I, I can't either. Not between the man in the sketch and Cheryl. Maybe, uh, no, I don't know. Maybe what? Maybe Cheryl procured for Ben. You know, found the kids for the videos. Oh! Y-y-you could have a convulsion. You could die... You could die. It's worse than a heart attack. If you don't have a drink, you're gonna have a convulsion. You know, I tried drying out once. I checked myself into this detox center. And, uh... I... They shot me up with, um... Uh, I don't know what it was, legal drugs. I woke up in the middle of the night, there was this monster over my bed. I think, I start hitting myself. I thought I was dreaming. I was wide awake and it wouldn't go away. It was the most hideous thing that I ever saw. I could even smell it. You believe me, Red? It's not worth it. Katie, you just don't wanna lose a-a drinking buddy. That isn't fair. I'm worried about you. Yeah, well, you should be, Katie. I think I'm an alcoholic. I know you are. I can stop drinking anytime I want. And so can you. Now is not the time. What are my options, Kate? Well, there's no other way for me to do it now. Alright, alright, you go ahead. You do it your way. But you have got to take something. Listen to me, I've got some valium-- No damn... Just butt out! Where are you, Lawrence? Where'd you take that kid? What's... Hey, what's this? Oh, a locker key? Cheryl, where did he send you? Where are you? I will find you! I will find you! [screams] (Patrick) I just walked Katie home. Are you alright? You don't have to stay. I know. I want to. [chuckles] Did Jonathan wanna live with you? I mean, is that what you were planning? I mean, I-I-I understand if he did. You mean, did he wanna run away from you? No. He loves you. I just wanted to see him, Martha. (Martha) He hates it when I drink. Yeah. But he doesn't hate you. He doesn't know the difference. Do you? Yeah. Can I ask you somethin'? Why did you start drinking? I, uh, Martha, I really wanna know. -I'm not accusing you. -Yes, you are! You moved out, remember? You preferred almost anyone to me! I moved out 'cause you're a drunk, Martha. You're a damn drunk! Here we go again, huh? Here I go again. Well, it's gotta stop. You understand? It stops right now! Martha, I want to understand. I really do. But we both screwed up here. First with our marriage, then our son. Well, we gotta take some responsibility and stop blaming each other, 'cause we both want him back! I want him back! [sighs] You-you wanna know why I really moved out? The truth? [sighs] 'Cause I was jealous. Martha, I was jealous of your writing. I mean, you were so damn good. You're busy all the tine. And then you started drinkin', and that made it real easy for me to blame you, and damn it, I blamed you. And, uh, these other women... Martha, they were just uh, other women. They weren't you. Well, I was busy being Red Tierney, anyways. Did you know I was nominated for a Pulitzer? Well, you think that surprises me? You're a hell of a writer, Martha. You're damn right. Hell of a writer. I came home so excited. Well, after a celebration lunch at the bar with the boys, of course. And the house was empty. You weren't here to tell. I-I think it was the, the first time that I realized that you were really gone. So I got really drunk. I don't remember Jonathan coming home from school. And I was, uh, still out cold the next morning when he left. He got there safely that time. So when I came to, I, uh... I took all my little journalism awards and... threw 'em against the wall out back. You earned those awards, Martha. I earned an empty house. I had so much to live up to. I, I was Red Tierney. How could you be jealous of me? You can stop drinkin' now, Martha. I know you can do it. ♪ Let's see Jonathan ♪ Brush those pegs ♪ Cha-cha-cha-cha-cha ♪ Cha-cha-cha-cha-cha ♪ He wouldn't need a stool ♪ If he had longer legs ♪ Cha-cha-cha-cha-cha ♪ Cha-cha-cha-cha-cha ♪ (Jonathan) And from the ghoulies, and the ghosties, and the long-legged beasties, and things that go bump in the night.

Some inspired, uplifting end of a novel? Next time, I'll take a drink. Or the next, or the next. See, that's the way it works, Patrick. The demons don't just go home. Oh, it's pathetic, isn't it? I agree. I agree. I agree! You don't understand! You don't understand! [grunts] I want a drink! More than I wanna write, more than I want you back! More than I want my baby back, I want a drink. [sobbing] I... [Jonathan grunts] [bustling traffic] [exhales] [sighs] (Mooney) The guy in the sketch is Lawrence Muller. Who is he? How-how did you find him? Well, I got a call from a couple of tourists from Utica. They were watching the news. They saw the sketch. They called in. They said he's Lawrence Muller and that's when I remembered that son of a bitch. Excuse me, madam. You have any sugar, Mr. Tierney? Right there. Seems that Muller was a professor of literature at Syracuse a while back. This was six, seven years ago. Pillar of the community. Boy, do I love that phrase. And he was coaching some local swimmin' team. His son was on the team. He got caught... molesting another kid, nine years old. [gasps] Oh. (Mooney) Yeah, I talked to the judge on the case. I woke him up too. This is kind of interesting 'cause the judge said that Muller was genuinely remorseful throughout the trial. While he was jail, he requested all kinds of psychological counseling to help him get over his problem. In fact, he was released early. Only served five years. He was cured, according to the prison shrinks. I never trust psychiatrists. Those cockroaches aren't cured in jail. They're raped! How the hell could he be cured? He's a chicken hawk! It's like an addiction. Never goes away. Sorry. Uh, this Lawrence then is the same one who called at Cheryl's, right? Yeah, he probably is. Well, then that would mean that he's connected to this kiddie porn ring, right? (Mooney) Somehow. What does it mean then when he says... "I can't find him?" (Mooney) Hmm. That's what I've been askin' myself over and over all morning long, Mrs. T. [sobbing] [indistinct chatter on TV] Excuse me. -Hey, Georgie. How's it goin'? -Hey. (Martha) Vodka. (man on TV) Jonathan Tierney, age eight, of Brooklyn Heights was reported missing last night. He failed to show up at his school, St. Edwards, and has not been seen for two days. He is the son of bestselling novelist Patrick Tierney and former journalist Martha Tierney. Sergeant Mooney of the Brooklyn Heights Precinct number 74 suspects foul play. He believes the boy may have been seen last walking east on Pierpont Avenue with a tall man in his late 30s. (Mooney) Ah, you saw that stuff in the bedroom. Look at all of this. Look here. They didn't take enough. This is no ordinary burglary. Whoever did this was lookin' for Lawrence Muller. He must have a stash here someplace. Keep lookin' for it. There's no address book, there's no appointment book, there's no nothin' here. So... who'd wanna know where he is and why? Hey, sarge. Oh, my goodness, lookie there, Mr. Respectable. How about this? Isn't that cute? A pillar of the community. Hey. Bingo. Numbered tapes, just like the ones we found in the lockers. Attaboy. Atta baby. Here we go. Oh, boy. Oh, God! I hate this stuff. What if this, uh, Sir Lawrence of Syracuse was one of the, uh, Cheryl's regular customers, except this time he wanted live action and he got Cheryl to supply it for him? Yeah, okay. So, what if I were Ben Nicolaides, kiddie porn king... and I discovered my delivery girl delivered a kid to a customer instead of a tape? Then you'd wanna kill her, maybe. No maybe. I'd wanna kill Lawrence Muller, too, if I could find him. Because he blew the whole operation, right? And I'd have to kill Jonathan Tierney. [turns doorknob] You gotta stop runnin' away, Martha. Club soda. It's a good drink. How do you keep finding me? Katie told me this time. You know, on the news... they referred to you as a bestselling novelist... [sighs] and to me as a former journalist. The bastards. [dramatic music] [telephone ringing] -Hello? -Mom. -Jonathan. -Mom! This horrible man took me. (Martha) Honey, where are you? A-are you okay? -Oh, honey, try not to cry. -I'm okay. -Your daddy's here. We love you. -We love you, Jon. Daddy! I waited for you. I know you did. It's gonna be okay. Can you see anything out your window? -I saw a river. -Can you tell what river it is? -No. -Try to remember. There were some leopards outside. And, uh, and across the street, there was a weird statue a-a-and the doors, they were all made out of glass-- D-did you see a-a-a street sign or a house number? -It's uptown. -He said uptown! [intense music] [door opens] He's back! Mom, he's back. Please come and get me. -Ooh! -Jon! Well, he'll be safe. He'll be okay. -He'll be... Oh, God! -He'll be alright. Okay, okay. (Jeff) Right there, right there. You see the, the leopards and the glass doors? Now Child Exploitation was spot-checking these tapes that we got out of the lockers in Lawrence Muller's apartment and I saw a few of 'em and I remembered this when you mentioned the leopards. I-I-I wanna see a-a-a house number or a street name or something! I know this is the Upper West Side. Or the Upper East Side. The point is he's in the building! Jon is there. (Jeff) Oh, yeah? Even if he is, for how long? I mean, the bad guys watch the news too. They know we're after him by now. And how are we supposed to find this damn house, anyway? Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you doin'? -Where are you goin'? -To look for the building. What are you gonna do? Drive around for a thousand blocks? What are you gonna do, sergeant? [dramatic music] -Aah! -No, no, it's okay, Jonathan. I'm not gonna hurt you. Just come talk to me. Come talk to me, okay? [grunts] [groans] [breathing heavily] I don't understand. I don't understand why you're doing this to me. Why can't you accept it? I just wanna show you what love can be. I just wanna show you what love can be. [knock on door] [knock on door] [knock on door] -Who is it? -I'm a friend of Cheryl's. She's been hurt. Lawrence? (Lawrence) Just a minute. -You're Lawrence Muller? -Who are you? What do you want? So, uh, have you had your kicks yet, Larry? -Where's the kid? -What do you mean? -Where is he? -He's gone. He's not here. He escaped last night. You can see for yourself. If he's escaped, then why are the police still lookin' for him, short eyes? Oh, God. You know, you make me sick. You get it on with kids and you make me sick! Where is he? I told you, I don't know. I don't know. Oh, you let him go so he can run, tell the cops all about you? Oh, Larry, Larry. It took me a while to figure out Cheryl gave you the keys, pervert. What's the ladder for? Oh, an attic. I never even knew that was there. What'd he do? Punch you in the nose? -Hey. Hey, come here. -Come on down, kid... You can't, you can't go up there. You get away from him. You get away from him. Come down here, godammit! Get away, he's mine. Mine! Mine! He's mine! Mine! Mine! Mine! [screams] [horns honking] [indistinct shouting] -Can't you go over the sidewalk? -Relax, Martha, we'll get there. What? What are you doing? Martha. Martha! [honking] [tires screeching] [soft music] (male #2) Miss? Miss! Excuse me, ma'am. -Martha, what are you doin'? -License plates. License plates of parked cars. Maybe we can read 'em. We don't allow personal tapes to be played on the machines. We can get the addresses through the DMV. (Patrick) They could belong to anybody's cars. (Martha) Patrick, people in New York kill for parking places near where they live. There! There. I knew it. I knew it. Here, write it down. Uh, "APG-113." Come on. Look, look, i-it's the same car as in the last tape! It lives there. It lives there. [phone rings] 84th Precinct. Hi, uh, this is Martha Tierney. Please tell Sergeant Mooney to get me these license plates and these addresses, uh, fast. And please call off Officer Kelly, number 2-9, uh, 2-8-9-3. He's giving me a ticket. Tell him to give me a police escort instead. -I got you. -Okay. These are all New York plates. -"APG 113." -APG 113. Yeah, "GT-I, GTI 346." "BNM 932." You got it? -We'll get back to you. -Yeah, got it. Very impressive. Shades of Red Tierney, huh? Yeah. Jonathan? Jonathan. Jonathan, we're safe now. That man won't hurt us anymore. But you have to come down now. It's time to go. Jonathan, please believe me. Nobody's gonna hurt us anymore. But we have to go now. We can't stay here anymore. You're a liar! A dirty, stinkin' liar! I hate you! I hate you! Alright, if y-y-you, if you won't come down, you know, I can make you come down. Is that what you want me to do? I can make you come down, Jonathan. You want me to do that? You want me to light, light a fire? Is that what you want me to do, Jonathan? I can do that. You know I can do that. You want me to light a fire? Okay. [telephone ringing] -Yeah. -We got those addresses. Okay, shoot. -40-41 West 103rd. -3rd. -68 West 102nd. -2nd. Great, okay, tell Mooney to meet us in that area. Yeah, uh, tell him he's been scooped by superior wit. -Okay, you got it. -Yeah, thanks. Okay, two on 103rd, one on 102nd, Westside! 103rd Riverside, let's go. [siren wailing] [dramatic music] Smell the fire, Jonathan? Better come down before it's too late. Come on... Oh! Jonathan, come down now. Jonathan, come on down. H-hurry. Hurry up! No, J... Jonathan, really, I mean it! Hey. Jonathan. [grunting] [gasping] Jonathan, come on now, come on. Jonathan! Oh! (Jonathan) Stop! Stop! I'm coming down! -Jona... -No! Jon, come on down. Jonathan! Oh, God, no. [coughing] -Jonathan. -Please. Jonathan, please come down. -Stop! -Come on, come on. -Oh. -No! Oh. (Jonathan) No! No! Please! (Patrick) Well, maybe it's on a side street. (Martha) No, I think it's Riverside. He said he could see the river. Okay, this is 103rd. -Martha, the statue! -Look! Look, glass doors. Stop, stop. This is it, this it it. Everything. Look, leopards. -My God, what's that? -There's a fire up there. Call the fire department! [intense music] Oh! [gasps] Oh. Oh! Where is he? Where's my son? (Jonathan) Daddy! Dad! -We'll get you down, Jonathan! -Jon! -Mommy, mommy! -Stand back, Martha! [glass shatters] (Jonathan) Mom! -Mom! -I'm coming, darling. (Patrick) I'm gonna get some water. Martha, what are you doin'? -Martha. -I'm afraid. Jon, jump to me. Come on, baby. -I'm afraid. -Come on, darlin'. [screaming] (Patrick) Jonathan! [sobs] Oh, my God. (Mooney) Jeff, come here. (Jonathan) Mommy. [sobbing] Where is he? (Jeff) Where did he go? A pillar of the community. (Jonathan) I was so scared. (Martha) You're safe. [sirens wailing] [indistinct chatter on police radio] That was so brave, kid. So brave. -Can we go home now? -Yes, honey, yeah. We're going home. -Mr. Tierney? -Sergeant, thank you. Thank you. Hey, I'm just glad it all worked out. It was a pleasure to be scooped by you, Mrs. Tierney. I'll miss you, Red. Uh, I'm gonna need to go away for a while to learn how not to drink in a couple of weeks and, uh, I'd like you to stay with Jon. Of course, I will. Martha, it appears to me you've stopped drinkin'. I stopped for Jonathan, now I have to stop for me. Well, then you will. Yeah, I will. Martha. [instrumental music] [siren wailing] [instrumental music]
